uh they think that they slash slam that
 
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
down all the time
 
00:08:05.189 --> 00:08:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:08.720 align:start position:0%

00:09:01.269 --> 00:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
i don't know if you leave them in the
 
00:09:03.829 --> 00:09:03.839 align:start position:0%
corner right there that's way they can
 
00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:16.399 align:start position:0%
well i have a
 
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
message that i think is
 
00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:20.720 align:start position:0%
i think is the clerk says she's going to
 
00:09:22.949 --> 00:09:22.959 align:start position:0%
be 30 minutes late
 
00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:25.360 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to start without her
 
00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.550 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to start without her
and

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:09:27.829 --> 00:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
she's going to have to play catch up
 
00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:53.040 align:start position:0%

energy committee
 
00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:40.399 align:start position:0%
which i find myself in an unusual
 
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
position this morning is usually bills
 
00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:44.240 align:start position:0%
like this come to our committee
 
00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:48.640 align:start position:0%
but um i just wanted to say that uh
 
00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
we don't normally uh i don't normally
 
00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
send bills for for commissions because
 
00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
uh uh they're expensive and sometimes
 
00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
they they seem to go on forever however
 
00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:02.360 align:start position:0%
i'm introducing hp
 
00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
1005 as a commission because it is very
 
00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
important to our forest industry
 
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
and as you might know in the past
 
00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
our forest industry which is great for
 
00:11:16.069 --> 00:11:16.079 align:start position:0%
recreation and also with the fact that
 
00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
our forests need to be healthy
 
00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:20.240 align:start position:0%
has relied on
 
00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
10 biomass plants to produce electricity
 
00:11:25.829 --> 00:11:25.839 align:start position:0%
and do and use our
 
00:11:26.829 --> 00:11:26.839 align:start position:0%
you know waste
 
00:11:29.269 --> 00:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
wood eight of these ten plants have
 
00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
closed the
 
00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:32.240 align:start position:0%
the market
 
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
is expensive for producing energy
 
00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
uh the forest people cannot find uh
 
00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:40.240 align:start position:0%
adequate markets to
 
00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
do with their trash wood which is
 
00:11:44.069 --> 00:11:44.079 align:start position:0%
important like i said before for keeping
 
00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
the forest healthy we are the second
 
00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's
 
00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
number two in the most forested state in
 
00:11:52.949 --> 00:11:52.959 align:start position:0%
the country and our tourist industry
 
00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
depends on good hiking and good forest
 
00:11:58.389 --> 00:11:58.399 align:start position:0%
health so the purpose of submitting this
 
00:11:58.399 --> 00:11:59.190 align:start position:0%
health so the purpose of submitting this
bill

00:11:59.190 --> 00:11:59.200 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
is to establish a commission to find out
 
00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
and talk about
 
00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:06.160 align:start position:0%
other markets that might be
 
00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
found for our wood industry
 
00:12:11.509 --> 00:12:11.519 align:start position:0%
we know
 
00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
like i said before we know that the cost
 
00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
of biomass is prohibitively expensive
 
00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
which is why
 
00:12:22.829 --> 00:12:22.839 align:start position:0%
i don't feel like we should be
 
00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
um supporting the forest industry on the
 
00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
backs of electric rate payers however i
 
00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:29.680 align:start position:0%
do support the forest industry in that
 
00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
we must find other ways for keeping this
 
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
industry going so we can protect our
 
00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
forests our
 
00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:37.200 align:start position:0%
tourist industry and of course to
 
00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:39.200 align:start position:0%
protect the people that have jobs in it
 
00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:40.720 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:42.389 align:start position:0%
right now
uh

00:12:42.389 --> 00:12:42.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:44.240 align:start position:0%
i mentioned about the policies that led
 
00:12:46.389 --> 00:12:46.399 align:start position:0%
to closing of these uh biomass plants
 
00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
because the market is very very low now
 
00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:51.200 align:start position:0%
for uh for keeping them open
 
00:12:53.509 --> 00:12:53.519 align:start position:0%
and uh so this commission is is uh
 
00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
designed to have experts come in from
 
00:12:57.350 --> 00:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
from around the state
 
00:12:59.910 --> 00:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh to discuss uh the various facets of
 
00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
the timber industry and to help find any
 
00:13:05.269 --> 00:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
emerging markets that might be uh useful
 
00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
for our trash wood
 
00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:09.680 align:start position:0%
just kind of an antidote while i was
 
00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
away a couple months ago on a short trip
 
00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
i ran into an individual from another
 
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
state that happened to be
 
00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
the owner of a industry that uses trash
 
00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
wood in his state and we had a very good
 
00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
conversation so i know there's markets
 
00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
out there that
 
00:13:28.629 --> 00:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
that can use our trash wood other than
 
00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
what we're using them for now and it's
 
00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
up to this commission to find out what
 
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:34.240 align:start position:0%
they might be and how they could be used
 
00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:35.680 align:start position:0%
for this
 
00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
for our state
 
00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
now the original bill that that you see
 
00:13:41.189 --> 00:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
before you was supposed to have been
 
00:13:43.829 --> 00:13:43.839 align:start position:0%
submitted last biennium but because of
 
00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:46.160 align:start position:0%
the snafu and emails it it never got
 
00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:48.720 align:start position:0%
approved so it carried over into this
 
00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:49.509 align:start position:0%
approved so it carried over into this
year

00:13:49.509 --> 00:13:49.519 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
since then we've come up with an
 
00:13:53.269 --> 00:13:53.279 align:start position:0%
amendment that i think makes the bill
 
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
better it
 
00:13:57.430 --> 00:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
specifically in part two of who would be
 
00:13:59.350 --> 00:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
on on the commission
 
00:14:01.269 --> 00:14:01.279 align:start position:0%
i think one of the important points i
 
00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
want to bring out is that we we only
 
00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
require one sandra to be on on this
 
00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
commission uh usually that's all you're
 
00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
gonna get anyway
 
00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
and uh three house members but there are
 
00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
other things in this amendment that i
 
00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
would hope that this committee would
 
00:14:18.949 --> 00:14:18.959 align:start position:0%
adopt there's another change to a date
 
00:14:20.629 --> 00:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
on the final report
 
00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:22.160 align:start position:0%
that says uh
 
00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
2022 is the final report uh being being
 
00:14:27.189 --> 00:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
a realist that's really not going to
 
00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:29.680 align:start position:0%
happen during this coming campaign year
 
00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
so i think my amendment will have a
 
00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
change to 2023
 
00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:35.750 align:start position:0%
change to 2023
now

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
as a final sum up because people will
 
00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:38.949 align:start position:0%
as a final sum up because people will
come

00:14:38.949 --> 00:14:38.959 align:start position:0%
come
 
00:14:40.389 --> 00:14:40.399 align:start position:0%
after me
 
00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
to discuss the possibilities of what
 
00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:44.240 align:start position:0%
could happen to our emerging market for
 
00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
wood industry i just want to say that i
 
00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
grew up upstate new hampshire in the
 
00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
town of warford and
 
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
i grew up with my friends parents were
 
00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
loggers they did a lot of industry there
 
00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
and i
 
00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
i also uh recognized that in my own town
 
00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
of londonderry we have an industry uh
 
00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
i think it's melting caterpillar that is
 
00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
very heavily involved with the wood
 
00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
industry so this this issue is not
 
00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:12.160 align:start position:0%
specific to one area or one town it
 
00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
affects the entire state
 
00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
either indirectly or directly
 
00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:17.910 align:start position:0%
either indirectly or directly
so

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
i would appreciate consideration of hp
 
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
108 10 1 0 0 8
 
00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:25.030 align:start position:0%
108 10 1 0 0 8
and

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:15:26.949 --> 00:15:26.959 align:start position:0%
five i mean and so
 
00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
i'm going to leave any questions to come
 
00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
up for people behind me
 
00:15:33.269 --> 00:15:33.279 align:start position:0%
and uh know the fact that we are working
 
00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:34.720 align:start position:0%
on this amendment
 
00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
uh to make this bill even better so with
 
00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:40.160 align:start position:0%
that i will close mr chairman and i hope
 
00:15:44.629 --> 00:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:47.749 --> 00:15:47.759 align:start position:0%
thank you that that's fine uh i
 
00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
will take some questions i'll ask but i
 
00:15:52.829 --> 00:15:52.839 align:start position:0%
think most will be answered by
 
00:15:52.839 --> 00:15:54.550 align:start position:0%
think most will be answered by
others

00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
others
 
00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
uh that's true if you have a general
 
00:15:59.110 --> 00:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
question uh i'll answer one or two but
 
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
if there's anything involving the
 
00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
technical aspects i i have at least
 
00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
three or four people behind me that that
 
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
can speak to it okay i just have one
 
00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:07.600 align:start position:0%

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:13.829 align:start position:0%

00:16:28.389 --> 00:16:28.399 align:start position:0%
commandment
 
00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
representative egan for a question thank
 
00:16:31.829 --> 00:16:31.839 align:start position:0%
you mr chair thank you represent for
 
00:16:34.069 --> 00:16:34.079 align:start position:0%
taking my question are you aware that
 
00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:36.320 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has a new hampshire canada
 
00:16:39.269 --> 00:16:39.279 align:start position:0%
trade council and therefore when you're
 
00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
suggesting your senators or
 
00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
representatives knowing the amount of
 
00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
lumber trade that goes on between new
 
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire and quebec and canada it might
 
00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
be good to look at those representatives
 
00:16:51.509 --> 00:16:51.519 align:start position:0%
that have a better understanding of
 
00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
sort of the import export market i just
 
00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
want to make sure you were aware of that
 
00:16:56.389 --> 00:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
organization has actually run through
 
00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state's office here in
 
00:16:59.590 --> 00:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
the state i say so because i'm actually
 
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
a mental but it might be worthwhile when
 
00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:03.590 align:start position:0%
a mental but it might be worthwhile when
you're

00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
you're
 
00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
searching out your representatives and
 
00:17:06.789 --> 00:17:06.799 align:start position:0%
senators to serve on this commission i
 
00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
think it's a great idea and i would
 
00:17:10.789 --> 00:17:10.799 align:start position:0%
recommend so were you that's the
 
00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
question is were you aware that we
 
00:17:13.669 --> 00:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
actually have a
 
00:17:15.429 --> 00:17:15.439 align:start position:0%
legislative group that works with canada
 
00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
on trade issues
 
00:17:18.789 --> 00:17:18.799 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question yes i am
 
00:17:20.949 --> 00:17:20.959 align:start position:0%
aware of that in fact i
 
00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
i believe one of the representatives
 
00:17:25.429 --> 00:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
that sits on my committee
 
00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
i think is a member of of that or is
 
00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
associated with the trade industry in
 
00:17:31.669 --> 00:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
one way or the other and i am looking at
 
00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
that representative as possibly to
 
00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
volunteer to be on this commission so
 
00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
yes i am aware of that
 
00:17:39.669 --> 00:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
simple follow-up could i who
 
00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:43.760 align:start position:0%

representative names in a testimony but
 
00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
if uh if if if you wish uh i i believe
 
00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:52.240 align:start position:0%
that representative is a representative
 
00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:55.120 align:start position:0%

uh i have a question i like the
 
00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:55.600 align:start position:0%
amendment the amendment takes the
 
00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
original bill that even tightens it up a
 
00:18:59.190 --> 00:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
little bit more especially when you
 
00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
added somebody from natural and cultural
 
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
resources to help resolve the problem
 
00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:06.640 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering in the next amendment
 
00:19:08.789 --> 00:19:08.799 align:start position:0%
version if there'll be anything on a
 
00:19:11.029 --> 00:19:11.039 align:start position:0%
goal that will look at some of the
 
00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:12.640 align:start position:0%
alternatives that the commission comes
 
00:19:15.029 --> 00:19:15.039 align:start position:0%
out with and the effect on new
 
00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that's your intent or
 
00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:21.590 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that's your intent or
not

00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
i'll certainly take that under
 
00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
advisement and talk to my
 
00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
people that are that are more involved
 
00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
with with that industry and i'm sure we
 
00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
can work something in there if it's
 
00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
industry yeah thank you mr taran thank
 
00:19:40.789 --> 00:19:40.799 align:start position:0%
you representative for taking my
 
00:19:43.669 --> 00:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
question uh in the amendment i i really
 
00:19:45.909 --> 00:19:45.919 align:start position:0%
like the new makeup of the uh
 
00:19:45.919 --> 00:19:47.029 align:start position:0%
like the new makeup of the uh
commission

00:19:47.029 --> 00:19:47.039 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
um by the way but um i did notice that
 
00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
you went from having the commission
 
00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
extend to 2025 to end in 2022
 
00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
and just wanted to ask you if you
 
00:19:59.750 --> 00:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
thought that was going to be enough time
 
00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
if you have commitments from people to
 
00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
say yes we can get this done or
 
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
um i um i believe that
 
00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
my final report
 
00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
that's in the amendment says 2022
 
00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
correct and i uh previously mentioned
 
00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
that that would be one of the changes
 
00:20:19.669 --> 00:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
that would come out in a in my amendment
 
00:20:19.679 --> 00:20:20.470 align:start position:0%
that would come out in a in my amendment
because

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:20.480 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:20:22.789 --> 00:20:22.799 align:start position:0%
with the season coming the way it is
 
00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
there is there wouldn't be enough time
 
00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
to have a final report by 2022 so i'm
 
00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
going to recommend that we have it at
 
00:20:29.669 --> 00:20:29.679 align:start position:0%
least 2023
 
00:20:32.149 --> 00:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
so it gives them more time to get all
 
00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
the experts together and have a good
 
00:20:37.029 --> 00:20:37.039 align:start position:0%
final report my intent is though once
 
00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
this commission does its job that it
 
00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
would cease and desist
 
00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
because i don't like
 
00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
never-ending commissions
 
00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:47.440 align:start position:0%
but i i would expect them to come up
 
00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
with a final report from which we can go
 
00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
on from there great thank you good to
 
00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
i will remind the representatives that
 
00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:00.320 align:start position:0%
the final amendment is what we put out
 
00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
uh it'll come here
 
00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
but we can still change it so
 
00:21:07.909 --> 00:21:07.919 align:start position:0%
there may be discussion on that final
 
00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
amendment as well here
 
00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:18.320 align:start position:0%
uh call
 
00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:20.400 align:start position:0%

you might as well put that in the
 
00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
amendment too
 
00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:52.000 align:start position:0%

association we represent timberland
 
00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:34.480 align:start position:0%
owners but we also represent the forest
 
00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:36.320 align:start position:0%
products industry that's the entire
 
00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
supply chain from stump to sheet of
 
00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:39.909 align:start position:0%
supply chain from stump to sheet of
paper

00:23:39.909 --> 00:23:39.919 align:start position:0%
paper
 
00:23:39.919 --> 00:23:41.110 align:start position:0%
paper
to

00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
the two by four that comes out the back
 
00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:45.440 align:start position:0%
end of a sawmill and so
 
00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
um come here today to support the bill
 
00:23:49.909 --> 00:23:49.919 align:start position:0%
and we support the amendment that
 
00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
representative thomas has has moved also
 
00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:55.669 align:start position:0%
representative thomas has has moved also
um

00:23:55.669 --> 00:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:58.789 --> 00:23:58.799 align:start position:0%
as as he mentioned in his testimony
 
00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
a lot of folks don't realize this we're
 
00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:02.720 align:start position:0%
the second most forested state in the
 
00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:05.360 align:start position:0%
nation behind maine as a percent of land
 
00:24:06.789 --> 00:24:06.799 align:start position:0%
mass and
 
00:24:09.269 --> 00:24:09.279 align:start position:0%
forests really define our state and kind
 
00:24:09.279 --> 00:24:10.149 align:start position:0%
forests really define our state and kind
of

00:24:10.149 --> 00:24:10.159 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
define our
 
00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
and also
 
00:24:14.549 --> 00:24:14.559 align:start position:0%
define us culturally but also
 
00:24:14.559 --> 00:24:17.190 align:start position:0%
define us culturally but also
economically

00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:17.200 align:start position:0%
economically
 
00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
our forest products industry is a 2.5
 
00:24:21.669 --> 00:24:21.679 align:start position:0%
billion dollar industry
 
00:24:23.909 --> 00:24:23.919 align:start position:0%
that's direct and indirect so that's
 
00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
people actually out in the woods or in
 
00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
the sawmills it's also the support
 
00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
industries like milton cat caterpillar
 
00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
that sell
 
00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:33.200 align:start position:0%
sell the skitter sell the harvester to
 
00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
the logger
 
00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
so it's it's a significant part of the
 
00:24:39.029 --> 00:24:39.039 align:start position:0%
forest products industry and
 
00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:40.400 align:start position:0%
a lot of people don't realize that
 
00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:42.320 align:start position:0%
because we don't have a big factory
 
00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
sitting next to interstate 93 all our
 
00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:46.720 align:start position:0%
work happens out in the woods
 
00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
and at sawmills throughout the state
 
00:24:51.669 --> 00:24:51.679 align:start position:0%
um i'm providing you
 
00:24:53.269 --> 00:24:53.279 align:start position:0%
three reports
 
00:24:55.669 --> 00:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
the first is the economic
 
00:24:57.990 --> 00:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
analysis done by unh cooperative
 
00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.990 align:start position:0%
analysis done by unh cooperative
extension

00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
extension
 
00:25:02.789 --> 00:25:02.799 align:start position:0%
that highlights the 2.5 billion dollars
 
00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:05.360 align:start position:0%
breaks it down by sector
 
00:25:07.909 --> 00:25:07.919 align:start position:0%
also talks about the number of jobs
 
00:25:10.789 --> 00:25:10.799 align:start position:0%
12 800 that this industry supports
 
00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:12.640 align:start position:0%
across the state
 
00:25:15.269 --> 00:25:15.279 align:start position:0%
so you have that report from unh
 
00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:18.400 align:start position:0%
cooperative extension it's the economic
 
00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
uh the economic analysis report
 
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.430 align:start position:0%
uh the economic analysis report
um

00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:23.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
so the
 
00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
the the entire industry though is
 
00:25:32.149 --> 00:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
it derives its existence on trees on
 
00:25:32.159 --> 00:25:33.510 align:start position:0%
it derives its existence on trees on
timberland

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
timberland
 
00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:34.870 align:start position:0%
timberland
um

00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned we're the second most
 
00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
forested state
 
00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:38.549 align:start position:0%
forested state
um

00:25:38.549 --> 00:25:38.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:38.559 --> 00:25:39.830 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:25:42.789 --> 00:25:42.799 align:start position:0%
timber harvesting occurs on an annual
 
00:25:45.029 --> 00:25:45.039 align:start position:0%
basis when you look at timber tax data
 
00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
we have about 2500 timber harvests that
 
00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:51.200 align:start position:0%
occur across the state of new hampshire
 
00:25:54.390 --> 00:25:54.400 align:start position:0%
and they occur in almost every town
 
00:25:57.029 --> 00:25:57.039 align:start position:0%
it sees it a timber harvest across the
 
00:25:58.789 --> 00:25:58.799 align:start position:0%
state um even
 
00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
places like manchester auburn and even
 
00:26:03.029 --> 00:26:03.039 align:start position:0%
on on the seacoast there is there is
 
00:26:05.269 --> 00:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
timber harvesting activity
 
00:26:05.279 --> 00:26:06.470 align:start position:0%
timber harvesting activity
um

00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:09.200 align:start position:0%
one of the unfortunate things is due to
 
00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
the nature of our timber
 
00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
in soils and climate a lot of our wood
 
00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
is considered low grade
 
00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
when i say considered low grade that's
 
00:26:21.029 --> 00:26:21.039 align:start position:0%
wood that's in incapable of producing
 
00:26:21.039 --> 00:26:22.789 align:start position:0%
wood that's in incapable of producing
lumber

00:26:22.789 --> 00:26:22.799 align:start position:0%
lumber
 
00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:24.400 align:start position:0%
traditionally that's gone into paper
 
00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:25.669 align:start position:0%
traditionally that's gone into paper
making

00:26:25.669 --> 00:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
making
 
00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
but also biomass power has been also a
 
00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
big part of that
 
00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
again looking at department of revenue
 
00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:34.720 align:start position:0%
timber tax data
 
00:26:36.149 --> 00:26:36.159 align:start position:0%
on average
 
00:26:39.269 --> 00:26:39.279 align:start position:0%
in 2020
 
00:26:42.549 --> 00:26:42.559 align:start position:0%
the state about 2.5 million tons of wood
 
00:26:44.549 --> 00:26:44.559 align:start position:0%
was harvested in new hampshire this is
 
00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
all products all species all grades so
 
00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:49.510 align:start position:0%
all products all species all grades so
that's

00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
and this is commercial so this isn't me
 
00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
going out back on the back 40 and
 
00:26:55.669 --> 00:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
cutting firewood for my wood stove this
 
00:26:55.679 --> 00:26:56.950 align:start position:0%
cutting firewood for my wood stove this
is

00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:26:58.630 --> 00:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
this is wood that's cut for sawmill
 
00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
production it's cut and hauled to paper
 
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
mills but it's also firewood that's cut
 
00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
and called to a processing facility that
 
00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:08.320 align:start position:0%
winds up selling it at your local
 
00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
convenience store or at a camp at a
 
00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:14.480 align:start position:0%
state campground so 2.5 million tons
 
00:27:15.669 --> 00:27:15.679 align:start position:0%
is what
 
00:27:17.029 --> 00:27:17.039 align:start position:0%
is produced
 
00:27:20.149 --> 00:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
from our forest every year
 
00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:22.640 align:start position:0%
the the biomass plants
 
00:27:25.269 --> 00:27:25.279 align:start position:0%
that representative thomas
 
00:27:25.279 --> 00:27:26.230 align:start position:0%
that representative thomas
mentioned

00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:26.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
those represented about a million tons
 
00:27:31.669 --> 00:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
of low-grade wood consumption so to put
 
00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
things in perspective
 
00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:34.720 align:start position:0%
to have
 
00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
about a million tons out of a two-point
 
00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
million ton market just kind of stop
 
00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
is pretty dramatic and it has sent a
 
00:27:45.269 --> 00:27:45.279 align:start position:0%
tremendous ripple through the industry
 
00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
exacerbating this
 
00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
in i think it was 2020 april 15 tax day
 
00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
2020 there's a paper mill in j maine
 
00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
that literally blew up
 
00:27:58.950 --> 00:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
um that pulp and paper mill
 
00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
um the digester blew up it was pretty
 
00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
extraordinary there's youtube videos on
 
00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:04.149 align:start position:0%
extraordinary there's youtube videos on
it

00:28:04.149 --> 00:28:04.159 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:07.360 align:start position:0%
but that mill also re represented they
 
00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
they drew fiber
 
00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
low-grade wood out of new hampshire
 
00:28:14.389 --> 00:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
and so to kind of quantify this
 
00:28:17.269 --> 00:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
last year senator bradley had asked
 
00:28:20.549 --> 00:28:20.559 align:start position:0%
um it asked to nhtoa to put together a
 
00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:22.640 align:start position:0%
report to kind of quantify what it
 
00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
what's going on with low-grade wood
 
00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:26.480 align:start position:0%
markets and so in your packet is a
 
00:28:29.029 --> 00:28:29.039 align:start position:0%
second report that we pulled together
 
00:28:31.269 --> 00:28:31.279 align:start position:0%
that kind of quantifies this it looks at
 
00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
the biomass plants
 
00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
but it also looks at the at the paper
 
00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:35.750 align:start position:0%
but it also looks at the at the paper
mill

00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
mill
 
00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:41.590 align:start position:0%
 
again

00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
you know the the six power plants 1.2
 
00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:46.750 align:start position:0%
you know the the six power plants 1.2
million

00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:46.760 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:50.240 align:start position:0%
1.25 million tons
 
00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
and then we also incorporate
 
00:28:54.549 --> 00:28:54.559 align:start position:0%
later on in the report some of the
 
00:28:57.190 --> 00:28:57.200 align:start position:0%
impacts from that from the
 
00:28:58.789 --> 00:28:58.799 align:start position:0%
from the paper mill
 
00:28:58.799 --> 00:28:59.750 align:start position:0%
from the paper mill
so

00:28:59.750 --> 00:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:02.480 align:start position:0%
again what this all means is the
 
00:29:05.029 --> 00:29:05.039 align:start position:0%
industry has seen tremendous contraction
 
00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
in the market
 
00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
um and the ripple effect has been pretty
 
00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
extraordinary as is a timberland owner
 
00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of what is growing on my
 
00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:17.200 align:start position:0%
property is considered low-grade what do
 
00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:18.640 align:start position:0%
i do with it
 
00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
i you know if i hire a logger to come
 
00:29:23.029 --> 00:29:23.039 align:start position:0%
and cut my you know do a thinning on my
 
00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
property or do some management he looks
 
00:29:27.669 --> 00:29:27.679 align:start position:0%
at my woodlot and says well i can take
 
00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
that tree or that tree but the rest i'm
 
00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
not sure i can what am i going to do
 
00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
with it
 
00:29:35.029 --> 00:29:35.039 align:start position:0%
traditionally they would be chipped or
 
00:29:37.269 --> 00:29:37.279 align:start position:0%
would be sent to a paper mill
 
00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:40.240 align:start position:0%
so it's created a management and as the
 
00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
resources committee the state's forest
 
00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:45.440 align:start position:0%
resource it's affecting the the state's
 
00:29:47.269 --> 00:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
forest resource we've seen the logging
 
00:29:49.029 --> 00:29:49.039 align:start position:0%
capacity contract
 
00:29:50.549 --> 00:29:50.559 align:start position:0%
we've also seen
 
00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
timber sales uh timber sales start the
 
00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:56.480 align:start position:0%
number of december sales contract
 
00:29:58.789 --> 00:29:58.799 align:start position:0%
talking to landowners and land managers
 
00:30:00.789 --> 00:30:00.799 align:start position:0%
there are instances where timberland
 
00:30:02.149 --> 00:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
they just can't
 
00:30:04.549 --> 00:30:04.559 align:start position:0%
literally can't harvest it why because
 
00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
there's not enough higher quality wood
 
00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
to economically justify entering that
 
00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:10.549 align:start position:0%
to economically justify entering that
property

00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:10.559 align:start position:0%
property
 
00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:13.360 align:start position:0%
so it's affecting the the you know the
 
00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
forest resource
 
00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:30:18.789 --> 00:30:18.799 align:start position:0%
the second piece and the kind of the the
 
00:30:20.389 --> 00:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
third trickle down you have the
 
00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
landowner you have the logger trying to
 
00:30:26.389 --> 00:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
operate on on a pretty slim margin as it
 
00:30:28.789 --> 00:30:28.799 align:start position:0%
is but the third is kind of this sawmill
 
00:30:30.389 --> 00:30:30.399 align:start position:0%
piece you say well how does this affect
 
00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
sawmills they use higher grade lumber or
 
00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
higher grade timber well because that
 
00:30:38.149 --> 00:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
logger that logging capacity is
 
00:30:38.159 --> 00:30:39.510 align:start position:0%
logger that logging capacity is
contracted

00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
contracted
 
00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:41.029 align:start position:0%
contracted
um

00:30:41.029 --> 00:30:41.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:43.029 --> 00:30:43.039 align:start position:0%
the number of saw logs are getting cut
 
00:30:45.909 --> 00:30:45.919 align:start position:0%
has also diminished and so what we're
 
00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:48.320 align:start position:0%
seeing is sawmills struggling to get
 
00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:49.350 align:start position:0%
seeing is sawmills struggling to get
enough

00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:49.360 align:start position:0%
enough
 
00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
timber to feed their mill
 
00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:53.440 align:start position:0%
a logging company that maybe had two or
 
00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
three crews before has one so not only
 
00:30:58.470 --> 00:30:58.480 align:start position:0%
are they producing less low grade
 
00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
they're also producing fewer saw logs so
 
00:31:03.029 --> 00:31:03.039 align:start position:0%
that same company now
 
00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:06.320 align:start position:0%
so that sawmill now has to has to try to
 
00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
attract more loggers
 
00:31:10.549 --> 00:31:10.559 align:start position:0%
and geographically go further outside
 
00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
the outside the state to try to attract
 
00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:13.750 align:start position:0%
the outside the state to try to attract
wood

00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
wood
 
00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
so it's increased cost for them
 
00:31:19.029 --> 00:31:19.039 align:start position:0%
the other thing is sawmills take round
 
00:31:21.029 --> 00:31:21.039 align:start position:0%
logs and make square lumber they chip
 
00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:22.480 align:start position:0%
those slabs
 
00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
what do you do with that chipwood in the
 
00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:26.640 align:start position:0%
days of old they used to take slabs and
 
00:31:28.549 --> 00:31:28.559 align:start position:0%
literally pile them up out behind the
 
00:31:28.559 --> 00:31:29.669 align:start position:0%
literally pile them up out behind the
sawmill

00:31:29.669 --> 00:31:29.679 align:start position:0%
sawmill
 
00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
friday night they had these metal
 
00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
teepees friday night they'd throw a
 
00:31:36.549 --> 00:31:36.559 align:start position:0%
match on it they'd come in sunday or
 
00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:38.240 align:start position:0%
monday morning and there'd be a pile of
 
00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
ashes and they'd say let's get some boys
 
00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
we're done
 
00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:44.640 align:start position:0%
can't do that anymore so those chips
 
00:31:46.549 --> 00:31:46.559 align:start position:0%
those slabs are now chipped
 
00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:48.240 align:start position:0%
and they go to they've traditionally
 
00:31:50.789 --> 00:31:50.799 align:start position:0%
gone to biomass markets or pulp and
 
00:31:50.799 --> 00:31:51.990 align:start position:0%
gone to biomass markets or pulp and
paper

00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
paper
 
00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.110 align:start position:0%
paper
again

00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:54.640 align:start position:0%
talking to sawmills and you'll hear from
 
00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
one today
 
00:31:58.630 --> 00:31:58.640 align:start position:0%
the number of markets is greatly reduced
 
00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
increasing cost and really starting to
 
00:32:03.509 --> 00:32:03.519 align:start position:0%
flip what was once considered an asset
 
00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
clean clean mill chips now into a
 
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.509 align:start position:0%
clean clean mill chips now into a
liability

00:32:07.509 --> 00:32:07.519 align:start position:0%
liability
 
00:32:09.509 --> 00:32:09.519 align:start position:0%
um and then the third piece the other
 
00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
piece for sawmills is kind of long
 
00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
term if
 
00:32:17.269 --> 00:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
looking out i'm a sawmill i'm looking
 
00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
out 20 i'm making capital investments
 
00:32:21.669 --> 00:32:21.679 align:start position:0%
today that i'm looking at a 15 20 year
 
00:32:21.679 --> 00:32:22.870 align:start position:0%
today that i'm looking at a 15 20 year
payback

00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
payback
 
00:32:25.029 --> 00:32:25.039 align:start position:0%
and i want to make sure that there's a
 
00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
timber resource that can feed my mill i
 
00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that people are
 
00:32:31.509 --> 00:32:31.519 align:start position:0%
performing sustainable good forestry
 
00:32:31.519 --> 00:32:32.470 align:start position:0%
performing sustainable good forestry
today

00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:32.480 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
that can feed my mill 15 20 years from
 
00:32:37.029 --> 00:32:37.039 align:start position:0%
now if there aren't markets for this
 
00:32:37.039 --> 00:32:38.149 align:start position:0%
now if there aren't markets for this
low-grade

00:32:38.149 --> 00:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
low-grade
 
00:32:40.149 --> 00:32:40.159 align:start position:0%
low-grade timber that makes that
 
00:32:40.159 --> 00:32:41.509 align:start position:0%
low-grade timber that makes that
sustainable

00:32:41.509 --> 00:32:41.519 align:start position:0%
sustainable
 
00:32:43.509 --> 00:32:43.519 align:start position:0%
forest improvement work on the land
 
00:32:43.519 --> 00:32:44.630 align:start position:0%
forest improvement work on the land
difficult

00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:46.480 align:start position:0%
and so they're looking at that saying
 
00:32:48.149 --> 00:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
all right i need to be thinking long
 
00:32:48.159 --> 00:32:49.110 align:start position:0%
all right i need to be thinking long
term

00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
term
 
00:32:51.909 --> 00:32:51.919 align:start position:0%
on kind of future wood quality
 
00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
so for all those reasons um and i think
 
00:32:57.909 --> 00:32:57.919 align:start position:0%
i exceeded my my my time limit
 
00:32:57.919 --> 00:32:58.789 align:start position:0%
i exceeded my my my time limit
um

00:32:58.789 --> 00:32:58.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:01.509 --> 00:33:01.519 align:start position:0%
but i i wanted to kind of lay this out
 
00:33:03.269 --> 00:33:03.279 align:start position:0%
to explain to you that we're looking at
 
00:33:03.279 --> 00:33:03.990 align:start position:0%
to explain to you that we're looking at
an

00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
an
 
00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
environmental kind of resource issue and
 
00:33:07.669 --> 00:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
it was a great question about the
 
00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
environmental piece we're looking at
 
00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
environment resources but we're also
 
00:33:13.669 --> 00:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
looking at an economics piece
 
00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
and so this
 
00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
this re this commission is very timely
 
00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:20.320 align:start position:0%
we have neighboring states already ahead
 
00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
of the curve on us trying to do this
 
00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:23.200 align:start position:0%
type of work
 
00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
and it would be great to have new
 
00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:26.789 align:start position:0%
and it would be great to have new
hampshire

00:33:26.789 --> 00:33:26.799 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:33:29.269 --> 00:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
follow suit and work on this
 
00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
so for that i i'd ask that you support
 
00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
00:33:35.909 --> 00:33:35.919 align:start position:0%
1005 and the the proposed amendment i'd
 
00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:39.200 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer any questions
 
00:33:43.669 --> 00:33:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
representative smith thank you mr chair
 
00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
and thank you mr stock for taking my
 
00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:50.480 align:start position:0%
question i know that a number of our
 
00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:51.750 align:start position:0%
question i know that a number of our
county

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
county
 
00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
complexes grafton in particular
 
00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:00.720 align:start position:0%
use biomass to provide power to their
 
00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
correctional facility nursing home
 
00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:05.440 align:start position:0%
administrative building whatever
 
00:34:07.509 --> 00:34:07.519 align:start position:0%
the amount that is used by these
 
00:34:07.519 --> 00:34:08.790 align:start position:0%
the amount that is used by these
individual

00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:34:11.230 --> 00:34:11.240 align:start position:0%
uh small biomass
 
00:34:14.470 --> 00:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
energy energy facilities how does that
 
00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
compare to what we've lost in biomass
 
00:34:19.829 --> 00:34:19.839 align:start position:0%
since the changes that came down a
 
00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
couple of years ago
 
00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:22.149 align:start position:0%
couple of years ago
sure

00:34:22.149 --> 00:34:22.159 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:34:23.430 --> 00:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question and it's
 
00:34:25.109 --> 00:34:25.119 align:start position:0%
it's a good question
 
00:34:28.149 --> 00:34:28.159 align:start position:0%
it's it's orders of magnitude difference
 
00:34:30.069 --> 00:34:30.079 align:start position:0%
um when you look at a biomass power
 
00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:31.919 align:start position:0%
plant that was consuming literally
 
00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of tons and county
 
00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:36.550 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of tons and county
complexes

00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
complexes
 
00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
i in my our community we have a school
 
00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
district that uses wood chips to heat
 
00:34:42.629 --> 00:34:42.639 align:start position:0%
its facilities
 
00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:44.720 align:start position:0%
you know they're using thousands
 
00:34:47.349 --> 00:34:47.359 align:start position:0%
thousands of tons versus hundreds of
 
00:34:49.990 --> 00:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
thousands of tons so although it helps
 
00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
and we love
 
00:34:53.829 --> 00:34:53.839 align:start position:0%
any market that we can have
 
00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
it's just you know we would need a lot
 
00:34:58.230 --> 00:34:58.240 align:start position:0%
of county complexes
 
00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
and a lot of school districts to make up
 
00:35:03.109 --> 00:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
the hundreds of thousands or the the 1.2
 
00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:04.640 align:start position:0%
million that's
 
00:35:05.829 --> 00:35:05.839 align:start position:0%
that we had
 
00:35:05.839 --> 00:35:06.870 align:start position:0%
that we had
surveyed

00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:06.880 align:start position:0%
surveyed
 
00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
representative gould
 
00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
for our question
 
00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:17.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you uh
 
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh
 
00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
where do we get our paper now
 
00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:24.640 align:start position:0%
so there are paper mills still operating
 
00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:25.510 align:start position:0%
so there are paper mills still operating
um

00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:27.200 align:start position:0%
there are paper mills that are that are
 
00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:28.720 align:start position:0%
still operating in
 
00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
in new england there's also a lot of
 
00:35:33.349 --> 00:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
paper being made offshore
 
00:35:35.109 --> 00:35:35.119 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:36.160 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:37.190 align:start position:0%
right now
in

00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
new england
 
00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
in in
 
00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
in terms of pulp making paper from wood
 
00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:43.589 align:start position:0%
in terms of pulp making paper from wood
chips

00:35:43.589 --> 00:35:43.599 align:start position:0%
chips
 
00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
directly from wood chips there's a paper
 
00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
mill in glens falls new york there's one
 
00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:50.720 align:start position:0%
in rumford maine and there are several
 
00:35:54.069 --> 00:35:54.079 align:start position:0%
in in northern maine as well
 
00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
again the thing to keep in mind is that
 
00:35:58.550 --> 00:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
wood chips are a commodity so to put a
 
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
wood chip on a truck
 
00:36:03.109 --> 00:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
you know the economics to haul it
 
00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
 
00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
miles aren't there
 
00:36:09.109 --> 00:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
there are paper mills such as monadnock
 
00:36:11.589 --> 00:36:11.599 align:start position:0%
paper down in the antrum area they make
 
00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:14.320 align:start position:0%
paper but they purchase pulp already
 
00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:15.990 align:start position:0%
paper but they purchase pulp already
pre-processed

00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
pre-processed
 
00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
um that's made you know at other paper
 
00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:21.440 align:start position:0%
mills um based on their paper making
 
00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:22.710 align:start position:0%
mills um based on their paper making
recipe

00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:22.720 align:start position:0%
recipe
 
00:36:25.109 --> 00:36:25.119 align:start position:0%
so for us you know it really comes down
 
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:28.240 align:start position:0%
to the the for for forest management
 
00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
where are the pulp mills
 
00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
and right now we have one in glens falls
 
00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
we have one in uh skowhegan maine we
 
00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
have a third
 
00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
and the third important one is in
 
00:36:43.829 --> 00:36:43.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:46.240 align:start position:0%
that answer your question
 
00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh any other questions from members of
 
00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:50.720 align:start position:0%
the committee seeing
 
00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
representative health
 
00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question i'm um
 
00:36:58.790 --> 00:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
relatively new to this
 
00:36:58.800 --> 00:36:59.829 align:start position:0%
relatively new to this
concept

00:36:59.829 --> 00:36:59.839 align:start position:0%
concept
 
00:36:59.839 --> 00:37:01.750 align:start position:0%
concept
um

00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:04.400 align:start position:0%
is this primarily
 
00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
private industry and we're just trying
 
00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
to figure out better ways for them to be
 
00:37:12.069 --> 00:37:12.079 align:start position:0%
able to perform their
 
00:37:12.079 --> 00:37:13.430 align:start position:0%
able to perform their
if

00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:37:16.390 --> 00:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
sure it's a half question but
 
00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for thank you for the
 
00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
question in other words this is not like
 
00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
a government
 
00:37:23.829 --> 00:37:23.839 align:start position:0%
exactly and i i should probably um i
 
00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:26.320 align:start position:0%
probably should have said that it
 
00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:28.720 align:start position:0%
what we're looking at is a study to look
 
00:37:31.109 --> 00:37:31.119 align:start position:0%
at how can we attract private capital
 
00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
private investment in the state
 
00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:36.160 align:start position:0%
maine is already kind of down this path
 
00:37:37.589 --> 00:37:37.599 align:start position:0%
they have it's called the forest
 
00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity road map for maine
 
00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:42.720 align:start position:0%
we're looking at trying to do something
 
00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:44.720 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire as well this is really
 
00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:46.960 align:start position:0%
kind of part of that effort but where
 
00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:48.880 align:start position:0%
are there where are there opportunities
 
00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
to attract businesses to new hampshire
 
00:37:53.829 --> 00:37:53.839 align:start position:0%
that could utilize this low-grade timber
 
00:37:55.349 --> 00:37:55.359 align:start position:0%
there are um
 
00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
there are of course
 
00:37:58.550 --> 00:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
we always know about we all know about
 
00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:01.280 align:start position:0%
wood pellets is one albeit it's still
 
00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
pretty small
 
00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:04.400 align:start position:0%
there are different other other
 
00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:06.720 align:start position:0%
different products such as biochar and
 
00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
then also liquid chemicals as well
 
00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
different types of
 
00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:14.240 align:start position:0%
liquid biodiesel things of that and so
 
00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
the function of this commission and why
 
00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
it's important to have these additional
 
00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:20.560 align:start position:0%
folks on it is to bring that expertise
 
00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
to bear and say all right what's out
 
00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:23.910 align:start position:0%
to bear and say all right what's out
there

00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:38:25.910 --> 00:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
what can we do to attract this
 
00:38:27.829 --> 00:38:27.839 align:start position:0%
investment in new hampshire
 
00:38:30.310 --> 00:38:30.320 align:start position:0%
because we get an economic impact but we
 
00:38:33.109 --> 00:38:33.119 align:start position:0%
also get a resource management impact
 
00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
representative harvey golia
 
00:38:41.829 --> 00:38:41.839 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:38:45.109 --> 00:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
um could we possibly take this
 
00:38:48.069 --> 00:38:48.079 align:start position:0%
road map from you know the studies that
 
00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:50.640 align:start position:0%
have been done in maine and sort of
 
00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:52.480 align:start position:0%
piggyback on that would that be a more
 
00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:54.400 align:start position:0%
direct method
 
00:38:56.870 --> 00:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
that's a great great question we can to
 
00:38:59.190 --> 00:38:59.200 align:start position:0%
some extent and another speaker can
 
00:39:01.829 --> 00:39:01.839 align:start position:0%
speak to it the thing to recall is that
 
00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
in maine there's a tremendous spruce fir
 
00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
forest spruce for a resource that isn't
 
00:39:09.109 --> 00:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
i mean we do have spruce for
 
00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
in higher elevations and in coast county
 
00:39:13.829 --> 00:39:13.839 align:start position:0%
but our forest types are slightly
 
00:39:13.839 --> 00:39:15.030 align:start position:0%
but our forest types are slightly
different

00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
in in many respects and so there are
 
00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:21.040 align:start position:0%
some there's some crossover and a future
 
00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
speaker today can kind of speak to that
 
00:39:26.069 --> 00:39:26.079 align:start position:0%
but it's not a one-to-one to say ah
 
00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
let's grab their report and let's just
 
00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
do it because there are some there's
 
00:39:32.069 --> 00:39:32.079 align:start position:0%
also some other kind of infrastructure
 
00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
differences as well in terms of
 
00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
how new hampshire's laid out and some
 
00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
real advantages that we have that they
 
00:39:42.310 --> 00:39:42.320 align:start position:0%
don't have there so there's some things
 
00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
we should
 
00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
it all merits a commission taking a look
 
00:39:47.349 --> 00:39:47.359 align:start position:0%
at it and certainly drawing from what
 
00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:58.390 --> 00:39:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:58.400 --> 00:39:59.430 align:start position:0%
 
they

00:39:59.430 --> 00:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:00.880 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if they have a true
 
00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:03.200 align:start position:0%
commission other than they have this
 
00:40:05.829 --> 00:40:05.839 align:start position:0%
forest opportunity roadmap which brings
 
00:40:05.839 --> 00:40:06.790 align:start position:0%
forest opportunity roadmap which brings
in

00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:40:09.109 --> 00:40:09.119 align:start position:0%
kind of what we're trying to do here
 
00:40:11.829 --> 00:40:11.839 align:start position:0%
with academia
 
00:40:15.109 --> 00:40:15.119 align:start position:0%
industry folks landowners etc and again
 
00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:16.960 align:start position:0%
i'm i know and
 
00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:18.960 align:start position:0%

there are others that will speak today
 
00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
that are
 
00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:24.800 align:start position:0%
more directly engaged in that project to
 
00:40:27.109 --> 00:40:27.119 align:start position:0%
get into how mechanically it was
 
00:40:27.119 --> 00:40:33.190 align:start position:0%
get into how mechanically it was
structured

00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:35.440 align:start position:0%

another form beyond just burning
 
00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
uh mr chairman in in light of the fact
 
00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
that we're running behind
 
00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
i i left one copy and i'll leave another
 
00:42:28.309 --> 00:42:28.319 align:start position:0%
um but we would be available to to work
 
00:42:29.589 --> 00:42:29.599 align:start position:0%
with everybody i've talked to some of

the people in the industry
 
00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:34.400 align:start position:0%
they seem to be in favor of of adding
 
00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
biotechnology to the to the commission
 
00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:39.200 align:start position:0%
and again the previous speaker spoke
 
00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:40.309 align:start position:0%
and again the previous speaker spoke
about

00:42:40.309 --> 00:42:40.319 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
bringing in people who have
 
00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
the ability to invest in new hampshire
 
00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:47.520 align:start position:0%

and pallet and currently legally it
 
00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
stands for hhp but we're a hardwood

sawmill located right down the road in
 
00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:23.440 align:start position:0%

but we employ 80 people
 
00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
we have uh let's see here
 
00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:54.720 align:start position:0%
yeah as far as as far as the uh you know
 
00:44:57.670 --> 00:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
purchasing of uh forest products uh we
 
00:45:01.349 --> 00:45:01.359 align:start position:0%
purchase annually 56 000 tons of pulp a
 
00:45:03.190 --> 00:45:03.200 align:start position:0%
year uh which will be going into the
 
00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
paper industry
 
00:45:07.589 --> 00:45:07.599 align:start position:0%
we also purchase
 
00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:10.240 align:start position:0%
roughly 13 and a half million board feet
 
00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
and through that procurement process we
 
00:45:18.309 --> 00:45:18.319 align:start position:0%
have about 85
 
00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
suppliers that bring us those products
 
00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
and lastly about hhp you know we over
 
00:45:28.309 --> 00:45:28.319 align:start position:0%
the next five years we plan on
 
00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
making a capital investment of about 18
 
00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:31.510 align:start position:0%
making a capital investment of about 18
million

00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
providing that you know everything goes
 
00:45:35.589 --> 00:45:35.599 align:start position:0%
well within the next five years
 
00:45:35.599 --> 00:45:36.630 align:start position:0%
well within the next five years
um

00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:36.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:38.470 --> 00:45:38.480 align:start position:0%
to talk about how
 
00:45:40.550 --> 00:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
biomass affects
 
00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:42.720 align:start position:0%
hhp and our suppliers
 
00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
as jason alluded to
 
00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
you know we we are hardwood sawmill so
 
00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:48.880 align:start position:0%
we technically
 
00:45:51.829 --> 00:45:51.839 align:start position:0%
buy high grade but as a result of sawing
 
00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
sawing that high grade
 
00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
there's a byproduct
 
00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
that goes into the low grade markets um
 
00:46:01.750 --> 00:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
this we
 
00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
byproducts equates to about roughly 25
 
00:46:09.910 --> 00:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
loads a week i would say
 
00:46:11.190 --> 00:46:11.200 align:start position:0%
and for
 
00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
many of those
 
00:46:15.829 --> 00:46:15.839 align:start position:0%
products which is sawdust chips bark
 
00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing
 
00:46:20.309 --> 00:46:20.319 align:start position:0%
there's really just one market
 
00:46:22.150 --> 00:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
for many of those products
 
00:46:25.109 --> 00:46:25.119 align:start position:0%
so it's a it's a tough situation uh for
 
00:46:26.829 --> 00:46:26.839 align:start position:0%
us you know if
 
00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
if anything that happened to any of
 
00:46:30.550 --> 00:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
those current markets i'm not sure
 
00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:32.640 align:start position:0%
exactly what we would do just to paint
 
00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:37.829 --> 00:46:37.839 align:start position:0%
as far as how biomass affects our
 
00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
procurement process
 
00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
in low grade uh our our bloggers really
 
00:46:46.309 --> 00:46:46.319 align:start position:0%
rely on
 
00:46:48.790 --> 00:46:48.800 align:start position:0%
this low-grade market um you know to be
 
00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
economically viable
 
00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
and also to do an adequate um harvesting
 
00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
job you know for for landowners
 
00:46:58.390 --> 00:46:58.400 align:start position:0%
and you know as jason said
 
00:47:00.550 --> 00:47:00.560 align:start position:0%
uh not only have we lost many you know
 
00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:02.720 align:start position:0%
loggers due to the low grade situation
 
00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
but they're less effective they can't
 
00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:06.720 align:start position:0%
produce as quickly
 
00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
there's logistical challenges they in
 
00:47:11.349 --> 00:47:11.359 align:start position:0%
money's tied up and all those sort of
 
00:47:13.109 --> 00:47:13.119 align:start position:0%
things so it's it's been
 
00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
very very tough uh i'm sure you've heard
 
00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:16.640 align:start position:0%
from many other industries that you know
 
00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:18.640 align:start position:0%
the the help and
 
00:47:21.589 --> 00:47:21.599 align:start position:0%
um is is a is a challenge for us the
 
00:47:23.589 --> 00:47:23.599 align:start position:0%
help certainly is but the second biggest
 
00:47:25.670 --> 00:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
one is is procurement
 
00:47:27.190 --> 00:47:27.200 align:start position:0%
and we don't really see that changing
 
00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:28.069 align:start position:0%
and we don't really see that changing
for

00:47:28.069 --> 00:47:28.079 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
a really long time you know if if the
 
00:47:31.829 --> 00:47:31.839 align:start position:0%
markets don't change
 
00:47:31.839 --> 00:47:33.190 align:start position:0%
markets don't change
um

00:47:33.190 --> 00:47:33.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:35.440 align:start position:0%
yeah and i guess if you guys have any
 
00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
questions i'll be willing to answer any
 
00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
representative post
 
00:47:47.270 --> 00:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my um
 
00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to speak mr
 
00:47:50.790 --> 00:47:50.800 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for being here today
 
00:47:53.589 --> 00:47:53.599 align:start position:0%
um you indicated that you have 85
 
00:47:55.349 --> 00:47:55.359 align:start position:0%
different suppliers where are they
 
00:47:57.589 --> 00:47:57.599 align:start position:0%
coming from
 
00:47:59.349 --> 00:47:59.359 align:start position:0%
primarily i'd say
 
00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
some are coming from
 
00:48:04.549 --> 00:48:04.559 align:start position:0%
massachusetts vermont but primarily i'd
 
00:48:07.589 --> 00:48:07.599 align:start position:0%
say 95 is within a small radius of our
 
00:48:07.599 --> 00:48:12.630 align:start position:0%
say 95 is within a small radius of our
mill

00:48:12.630 --> 00:48:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
any other questions from
 
00:48:16.470 --> 00:48:16.480 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
00:48:18.630 --> 00:48:18.640 align:start position:0%
if not thank you very much

thank you mr chairman members of the
 
00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
committee i'm charlie levesque
 
00:48:51.349 --> 00:48:51.359 align:start position:0%
i live in antrim new hampshire
 
00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
and i'm president of a consulting firm
 
00:48:55.349 --> 00:48:55.359 align:start position:0%
that's about 30 years old called
 
00:48:58.390 --> 00:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
innovative natural resource solutions
 
00:49:00.390 --> 00:49:00.400 align:start position:0%
we have our corporate office here in new
 
00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire we also have an office in
 
00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:03.190 align:start position:0%
hampshire we also have an office in
maine

00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:03.200 align:start position:0%
maine
 
00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
i'm here in strong support of hb 1005
 
00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
and the amendment i just got to see the
 
00:49:12.150 --> 00:49:12.160 align:start position:0%
amendment this morning
 
00:49:14.790 --> 00:49:14.800 align:start position:0%
it's a critical time and i know that the
 
00:49:17.190 --> 00:49:17.200 align:start position:0%
legislature often frowns on commissions
 
00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
and study committees but i remind you
 
00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
things like the renewable portfolio
 
00:49:23.829 --> 00:49:23.839 align:start position:0%
standard and lchip came out of study
 
00:49:25.829 --> 00:49:25.839 align:start position:0%
committees or commissions so sometimes
 
00:49:27.349 --> 00:49:27.359 align:start position:0%
really important things can come out of
 
00:49:29.349 --> 00:49:29.359 align:start position:0%
them so i urge you to to support it for
 
00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
that reason
 
00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
jason stock did a great job explaining
 
00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
what the problem is so this problem is
 
00:49:37.030 --> 00:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
not only in new hampshire it's across
 
00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
the region
 
00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
and uh the new england region has lost
 
00:49:43.510 --> 00:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
over 20 percent of its low-grade markets
 
00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:45.680 align:start position:0%
over the last few years and it's 40
 
00:49:47.670 --> 00:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
percent loss in new hampshire as jason
 
00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
said so when you lose 40 percent of the
 
00:49:51.829 --> 00:49:51.839 align:start position:0%
market for a particular industry it's a
 
00:49:54.630 --> 00:49:54.640 align:start position:0%
very serious problem and and to date
 
00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
unfortunately even though the sununu
 
00:49:58.710 --> 00:49:58.720 align:start position:0%
administration has known about this
 
00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
problem for a number of years they
 
00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
really haven't done anything on it and i
 
00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:04.240 align:start position:0%
think that's why there's a need for
 
00:50:05.990 --> 00:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
a commission coming out of the
 
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:07.349 align:start position:0%
a commission coming out of the
legislature

00:50:07.349 --> 00:50:07.359 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:50:08.710 --> 00:50:08.720 align:start position:0%
hopefully the administration will
 
00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
participate if you pass this bill but
 
00:50:12.950 --> 00:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
it's really essential
 
00:50:14.790 --> 00:50:14.800 align:start position:0%
i have some knowledge on what's going on
 
00:50:16.790 --> 00:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
in surrounding states to your questions
 
00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
around the four main effort but vermont
 
00:50:21.589 --> 00:50:21.599 align:start position:0%
has also stepped up to the plate about
 
00:50:24.390 --> 00:50:24.400 align:start position:0%
five years ago creating a working lands
 
00:50:26.470 --> 00:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
initiative fund which is a general fund
 
00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
appropriation that happens every year
 
00:50:30.150 --> 00:50:30.160 align:start position:0%
and it's for the forest products
 
00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
industry and also for the agricultural
 
00:50:34.230 --> 00:50:34.240 align:start position:0%
industry and a lot has happened with
 
00:50:35.670 --> 00:50:35.680 align:start position:0%
that that's how they stepped up to the
 
00:50:37.109 --> 00:50:37.119 align:start position:0%
plate to try to address some of these
 
00:50:37.119 --> 00:50:38.150 align:start position:0%
plate to try to address some of these
problems

00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
problems
 
00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
in maine uh the problem
 
00:50:42.150 --> 00:50:42.160 align:start position:0%
was not the biomass plants although
 
00:50:44.069 --> 00:50:44.079 align:start position:0%
that's been part of a problem there the
 
00:50:45.670 --> 00:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
problem there was a closure of pulp
 
00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:46.870 align:start position:0%
problem there was a closure of pulp
mills

00:50:46.870 --> 00:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
mills
 
00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
if you remember if you've been around
 
00:50:50.069 --> 00:50:50.079 align:start position:0%
here we used to have two pulp mills in
 
00:50:52.309 --> 00:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
new hampshire we had one in berlin we
 
00:50:54.230 --> 00:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
had in one in groveton they are long
 
00:50:55.670 --> 00:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
gone so we're not talking about pulp
 
00:50:57.349 --> 00:50:57.359 align:start position:0%
mills and we know we're not going to
 
00:50:59.270 --> 00:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
revive the biomass power plants although
 
00:51:01.109 --> 00:51:01.119 align:start position:0%
we hope we can maintain the two that are
 
00:51:03.349 --> 00:51:03.359 align:start position:0%
largely operating at this point we need
 
00:51:05.589 --> 00:51:05.599 align:start position:0%
to find solutions elsewhere and that's
 
00:51:07.990 --> 00:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
what this work would would be about in
 
00:51:10.390 --> 00:51:10.400 align:start position:0%
maine it happened in a major way about
 
00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
four years ago when
 
00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
senator angus king
 
00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:17.200 align:start position:0%
basically brought a swat team from the
 
00:51:19.109 --> 00:51:19.119 align:start position:0%
u.s department of commerce to the state
 
00:51:21.510 --> 00:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
of maine to look at the problem they
 
00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
just had several closures of pulp mills
 
00:51:24.870 --> 00:51:24.880 align:start position:0%
at the time
 
00:51:26.790 --> 00:51:26.800 align:start position:0%
and coming out of that is this forced
 
00:51:28.950 --> 00:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity roadmap initiative which is
 
00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
on its fourth year now working uh
 
00:51:32.549 --> 00:51:32.559 align:start position:0%
they've been funded with a lot of
 
00:51:34.230 --> 00:51:34.240 align:start position:0%
federal dollars and some state dollars
 
00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
in foundation funding but it's been a
 
00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
huge organization that the
 
00:51:39.750 --> 00:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
administration the legislative branch
 
00:51:42.069 --> 00:51:42.079 align:start position:0%
the private sector has been behind and
 
00:51:44.790 --> 00:51:44.800 align:start position:0%
they've already seen fruits they've got
 
00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:45.990 align:start position:0%
they've already seen fruits they've got
a

00:51:45.990 --> 00:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
brand new
 
00:51:50.470 --> 00:51:50.480 align:start position:0%
wood-based cellulose insulation plant
 
00:51:52.549 --> 00:51:52.559 align:start position:0%
being constructed as we speak in a
 
00:51:55.750 --> 00:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
former former site of a pulp mill
 
00:51:58.069 --> 00:51:58.079 align:start position:0%
and there's also a brand new company
 
00:52:00.390 --> 00:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
that is looking to commercialize biochar
 
00:52:01.829 --> 00:52:01.839 align:start position:0%
they are all coming out of this effort
 
00:52:03.670 --> 00:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
so the point of that is
 
00:52:05.589 --> 00:52:05.599 align:start position:0%
when you come together as a state both
 
00:52:07.030 --> 00:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
as state government working with the
 
00:52:09.270 --> 00:52:09.280 align:start position:0%
private sector as a commission would
 
00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
some good things could come out of it
 
00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:12.640 align:start position:0%
and we've got a good example that's
 
00:52:16.150 --> 00:52:16.160 align:start position:0%
going on next door uh in maine and so uh
 
00:52:19.829 --> 00:52:19.839 align:start position:0%
our company uh is uh involved in helping
 
00:52:21.109 --> 00:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
the forest products industry in
 
00:52:23.430 --> 00:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
renewable energy uh i'm also the
 
00:52:25.589 --> 00:52:25.599 align:start position:0%

00:52:27.190 --> 00:52:27.200 align:start position:0%

his colleagues in the northeast are part
 
00:52:36.870 --> 00:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
of this little non-profit and work
 
00:52:38.309 --> 00:52:38.319 align:start position:0%
together and they've identified this
 
00:52:40.870 --> 00:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
problem region-wide as a major problem
 
00:52:42.549 --> 00:52:42.559 align:start position:0%
for forestry in the forest products
 
00:52:45.589 --> 00:52:45.599 align:start position:0%
industry so i've got a lot of expertise
 
00:52:47.109 --> 00:52:47.119 align:start position:0%

yes i am very well well aware of that
 
00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
that that's come out of a federal grant
 
00:53:35.349 --> 00:53:35.359 align:start position:0%
from the usda forest service that
 
00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
project uh it's a real micro project
 
00:53:40.470 --> 00:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
it's not the kind of project uh that's
 
00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
going to address the big problems that
 
00:53:44.069 --> 00:53:44.079 align:start position:0%
we have although it's a good thing and
 
00:53:45.829 --> 00:53:45.839 align:start position:0%
anything that we can do but it's a very
 
00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
small project good project and thank you

are the kind of things that this you
 
00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:54.400 align:start position:0%
would hope this commission would look
 
00:53:56.549 --> 00:53:56.559 align:start position:0%
into whether it's due to working with
 
00:53:59.430 --> 00:53:59.440 align:start position:0%
universities federal grants and the idea
 
00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
that looking at
 
00:54:03.829 --> 00:54:03.839 align:start position:0%
what are new innovative ways to make
 
00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
wastewood be practical to our society

yes that's correct representative we
 
00:54:10.950 --> 00:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
need we need a kind of an all hands on
 
00:54:13.430 --> 00:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
deck approach and even small operations
 
00:54:15.270 --> 00:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
like they're trying to do there should
 
00:54:16.630 --> 00:54:16.640 align:start position:0%

really the reasons why this commission
 
00:55:09.990 --> 00:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
is important and certainly if you look
 
00:55:11.030 --> 00:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
at the
 
00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
findings and purpose
 
00:55:14.390 --> 00:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
in the bill
 
00:55:17.990 --> 00:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
the issue and the challenge very well i
 
00:55:22.789 --> 00:55:22.799 align:start position:0%
would just add one point i know
 
00:55:24.549 --> 00:55:24.559 align:start position:0%
you're running behind but
 
00:55:26.789 --> 00:55:26.799 align:start position:0%
um you know when we talk about
 
00:55:28.630 --> 00:55:28.640 align:start position:0%
you know the forest products industry
 
00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:30.240 align:start position:0%
and you know the stresses that they're
 
00:55:32.549 --> 00:55:32.559 align:start position:0%
facing you know ultimately
 
00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
um you know we should keep in mind that
 
00:55:37.510 --> 00:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
almost or a little over 70 percent of
 
00:55:38.950 --> 00:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
the forced
 
00:55:42.069 --> 00:55:42.079 align:start position:0%
land in new hampshire is privately owned
 
00:55:44.069 --> 00:55:44.079 align:start position:0%
private landowners you know it's not the
 
00:55:45.270 --> 00:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
federal government or the state
 
00:55:47.750 --> 00:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
government it's private landowners so
 
00:55:49.990 --> 00:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
you know we um
 
00:55:52.069 --> 00:55:52.079 align:start position:0%
think it's important to you know find
 
00:55:52.079 --> 00:55:53.270 align:start position:0%
think it's important to you know find
ways

00:55:53.270 --> 00:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
ways
 
00:55:55.990 --> 00:55:56.000 align:start position:0%
you know to help those landowners keep
 
00:55:58.309 --> 00:55:58.319 align:start position:0%
their forests as forests i mean that's
 
00:56:00.870 --> 00:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
sort of our ultimate goal
 
00:56:02.870 --> 00:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
so you know and for that reason we think
 
00:56:04.870 --> 00:56:04.880 align:start position:0%
this commission is very important to
 
00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
kind of get us you know to that ultimate
 
00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:10.160 align:start position:0%
goal so um that's why we support it um
 
00:56:13.270 --> 00:56:13.280 align:start position:0%

00:57:39.990 --> 00:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
as well as the amendment especially with
 
00:57:41.990 --> 00:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:42.390 align:start position:0%
the amendment
and

00:57:42.390 --> 00:57:42.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:44.630 align:start position:0%
and
[Music]

00:57:44.630 --> 00:57:44.640 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:57:47.030 --> 00:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
so i'm here to speak on that
 
00:57:49.589 --> 00:57:49.599 align:start position:0%
the single biggest issue facing
 
00:57:52.309 --> 00:57:52.319 align:start position:0%
timberland owners like myself
 
00:57:56.150 --> 00:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
is the lack of low-grade wood markets
 
00:57:58.230 --> 00:57:58.240 align:start position:0%
because low-grade markets are the
 
00:58:01.829 --> 00:58:01.839 align:start position:0%
underpinning of sustainable forest
 
00:58:04.710 --> 00:58:04.720 align:start position:0%
forestry and forest management
 
00:58:08.950 --> 00:58:08.960 align:start position:0%
and uh it provides also the
 
00:58:12.309 --> 00:58:12.319 align:start position:0%
the economic means for landowners
 
00:58:12.319 --> 00:58:13.349 align:start position:0%
the economic means for landowners
to

00:58:13.349 --> 00:58:13.359 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:58:16.230 --> 00:58:16.240 align:start position:0%
remove dead and decaying trees for
 
00:58:18.230 --> 00:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
forest health
 
00:58:21.430 --> 00:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
to remove those trees for uh that are
 
00:58:23.910 --> 00:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
dying because they've been
 
00:58:27.030 --> 00:58:27.040 align:start position:0%
infected with pathogens or are invasive
 
00:58:29.910 --> 00:58:29.920 align:start position:0%
species like the emerald ash borer which
 
00:58:33.270 --> 00:58:33.280 align:start position:0%
is now spread to nine out of ten of our
 
00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:35.030 align:start position:0%
is now spread to nine out of ten of our
counties

00:58:35.030 --> 00:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
counties
 
00:58:37.109 --> 00:58:37.119 align:start position:0%
it also enables the landowner to
 
00:58:37.119 --> 00:58:38.230 align:start position:0%
it also enables the landowner to
practice

00:58:38.230 --> 00:58:38.240 align:start position:0%
practice
 
00:58:41.349 --> 00:58:41.359 align:start position:0%
timber stand improvement for one thing
 
00:58:43.510 --> 00:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
which i do
 
00:58:46.950 --> 00:58:46.960 align:start position:0%
and that is to rehabilitate degraded
 
00:58:48.870 --> 00:58:48.880 align:start position:0%
hardwood stands
 
00:58:51.430 --> 00:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
and to replace you know
 
00:58:54.390 --> 00:58:54.400 align:start position:0%
less desirable species with
 
00:58:56.710 --> 00:58:56.720 align:start position:0%
better species for timber and for
 
00:58:56.720 --> 00:58:57.910 align:start position:0%
better species for timber and for
wildlife

00:58:57.910 --> 00:58:57.920 align:start position:0%
wildlife
 
00:59:00.870 --> 00:59:00.880 align:start position:0%
and also uh in my case to create and
 
00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:01.990 align:start position:0%
and also uh in my case to create and
maintain

00:59:01.990 --> 00:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
maintain
 
00:59:04.470 --> 00:59:04.480 align:start position:0%
trails for uh
 
00:59:07.349 --> 00:59:07.359 align:start position:0%
hiking and skiing and
 
00:59:10.470 --> 00:59:10.480 align:start position:0%
things like that recreational pursuits
 
00:59:12.549 --> 00:59:12.559 align:start position:0%
the contraction of the low-grade wood
 
00:59:16.789 --> 00:59:16.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:18.390 --> 00:59:18.400 align:start position:0%
is an opportunity
 
00:59:20.950 --> 00:59:20.960 align:start position:0%
you know with the biomass plant closures
 
00:59:22.950 --> 00:59:22.960 align:start position:0%
which you're all familiar with i'm sure
 
00:59:24.470 --> 00:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
and also the
 
00:59:26.150 --> 00:59:26.160 align:start position:0%

major pulp mill in j maine
 
00:59:32.789 --> 00:59:32.799 align:start position:0%
um it provides the opportunity for this
 
00:59:32.799 --> 00:59:34.069 align:start position:0%
um it provides the opportunity for this
bill

00:59:34.069 --> 00:59:34.079 align:start position:0%

00:59:37.750 --> 00:59:37.760 align:start position:0%

00:59:48.390 --> 00:59:48.400 align:start position:0%
solve some of these emerging

and new wood markets
 
00:59:54.230 --> 00:59:54.240 align:start position:0%
and it also sends i think a positive
 
00:59:54.240 --> 00:59:55.430 align:start position:0%
and it also sends i think a positive
message

00:59:55.430 --> 00:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
message
 
00:59:57.910 --> 00:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire cares about this
 
00:59:57.920 --> 00:59:59.430 align:start position:0%

01:00:02.549 --> 01:00:02.559 align:start position:0%

help these markets low-grade wood

markets and the emerging in new markets
 
01:00:13.750 --> 01:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
some of these markets are
 
01:00:16.230 --> 01:00:16.240 align:start position:0%
things you may already have heard about
 
01:00:20.230 --> 01:00:20.240 align:start position:0%

biochar for example one of my favorite
 
01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
that i'm following a lot is they they
 
01:00:34.710 --> 01:00:34.720 align:start position:0%
give value to those dead trees and
 
01:00:36.710 --> 01:00:36.720 align:start position:0%

01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
and they reduce
 
01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:40.069 align:start position:0%

01:00:40.069 --> 01:00:40.079 align:start position:0%

and
 
01:00:48.870 --> 01:00:48.880 align:start position:0%
they also if used as a soil amendment
 
01:00:50.390 --> 01:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
they um
 
01:00:53.030 --> 01:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
they promote soil health healthy soils
 
01:00:55.589 --> 01:00:55.599 align:start position:0%
for agriculture and for forest land
 
01:00:57.829 --> 01:00:57.839 align:start position:0%
and they have outstanding
 
01:00:59.349 --> 01:00:59.359 align:start position:0%
attributes for
 
01:01:01.430 --> 01:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
absorbing nutrients
 
01:01:03.510 --> 01:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
and agricultural chemicals so they
 
01:01:06.549 --> 01:01:06.559 align:start position:0%
reduce runoff into streams and so on
 
01:01:09.990 --> 01:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
and this particular area is exploding
 
01:01:11.589 --> 01:01:11.599 align:start position:0%
right now and they're just looking for
 
01:01:14.470 --> 01:01:14.480 align:start position:0%
places to go to and then i think we
 
01:01:16.230 --> 01:01:16.240 align:start position:0%
should be one of them
 
01:01:17.750 --> 01:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:01:19.349 --> 01:01:19.359 align:start position:0%

01:01:28.630 --> 01:01:28.640 align:start position:0%
help inform
 
01:01:30.870 --> 01:01:30.880 align:start position:0%
policies and programs that are really
 
01:01:32.950 --> 01:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
badly needed right now
 
01:01:34.309 --> 01:01:34.319 align:start position:0%
to address
 
01:01:36.870 --> 01:01:36.880 align:start position:0%
these low-grade wood markets
 
01:01:39.910 --> 01:01:39.920 align:start position:0%

i'm going to go back in time into the

60s and 70s when i began my career
 
01:03:22.630 --> 01:03:22.640 align:start position:0%
i bought a woodlot when i was
 
01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:23.349 align:start position:0%
i bought a woodlot when i was
a

01:03:23.349 --> 01:03:23.359 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
sophomore in high school i still own
 
01:03:27.510 --> 01:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
that woodlot and in fact i'm going to be
 
01:03:30.549 --> 01:03:30.559 align:start position:0%
doing a timber harvest on that
 
01:03:34.150 --> 01:03:34.160 align:start position:0%
i've owned that lot for almost 60 years
 
01:03:35.990 --> 01:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
and i hope to pass that on to my
 
01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.829 align:start position:0%
and i hope to pass that on to my
grandson

01:03:37.829 --> 01:03:37.839 align:start position:0%
grandson
 
01:03:40.309 --> 01:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
when i bought that property
 
01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
it had been cut over probably 15 years
 
01:03:46.230 --> 01:03:46.240 align:start position:0%
before there was still a viable timber
 
01:03:48.870 --> 01:03:48.880 align:start position:0%
stand on it a lot of old grade wood
 
01:03:50.470 --> 01:03:50.480 align:start position:0%
and is
 
01:03:53.270 --> 01:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
so i took an axe and i went in and
 
01:03:55.670 --> 01:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
girdled 38 acres
 
01:03:58.470 --> 01:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
getting rid of the low-grade trees
 
01:04:00.789 --> 01:04:00.799 align:start position:0%
i got some compensation from the federal
 
01:04:02.470 --> 01:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
government for doing that
 
01:04:04.549 --> 01:04:04.559 align:start position:0%
and since that time i've had two timber
 
01:04:08.470 --> 01:04:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:10.710 --> 01:04:10.720 align:start position:0%
but the important at that time there
 
01:04:13.109 --> 01:04:13.119 align:start position:0%
really wasn't much of a markets for many
 
01:04:15.589 --> 01:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
of the trees that were on the forest
 
01:04:18.150 --> 01:04:18.160 align:start position:0%
it's a hardwood forest
 
01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:19.109 align:start position:0%
it's a hardwood forest
and

01:04:19.109 --> 01:04:19.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:04:19.119 --> 01:04:19.910 align:start position:0%
and
i

01:04:19.910 --> 01:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:04:21.349 --> 01:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
griddled uh
 
01:04:23.430 --> 01:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
some soft maple and
 
01:04:25.029 --> 01:04:25.039 align:start position:0%
other trees but i saved some of those
 
01:04:26.549 --> 01:04:26.559 align:start position:0%
soft maples and those are going to be
 
01:04:26.559 --> 01:04:27.670 align:start position:0%
soft maples and those are going to be
cut

01:04:27.670 --> 01:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
cut
 
01:04:29.910 --> 01:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
in in the timber operation and at that
 
01:04:32.150 --> 01:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
time as i said there was no market for
 
01:04:33.589 --> 01:04:33.599 align:start position:0%
soft maple
 
01:04:35.589 --> 01:04:35.599 align:start position:0%
but today there is a very nice market
 
01:04:38.470 --> 01:04:38.480 align:start position:0%
for soft maple so over time
 
01:04:42.470 --> 01:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
i was able to to uh build the uh
 
01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
the forest and
 
01:04:46.630 --> 01:04:46.640 align:start position:0%
get the results of the change in the
 
01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:48.069 align:start position:0%
get the results of the change in the
marketplace

01:04:48.069 --> 01:04:48.079 align:start position:0%
marketplace
 
01:04:50.230 --> 01:04:50.240 align:start position:0%
but i i want to talk a little bit about
 
01:04:51.670 --> 01:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
the importance of
 
01:04:55.349 --> 01:04:55.359 align:start position:0%
markets in low-grade markets i travel a
 
01:04:57.190 --> 01:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
lot in in the west
 
01:05:00.150 --> 01:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
midwest i'm in the mountain west
 
01:05:02.789 --> 01:05:02.799 align:start position:0%
states like colorado wyoming montana
 
01:05:05.589 --> 01:05:05.599 align:start position:0%
idaho western south dakota and northern
 
01:05:05.599 --> 01:05:06.789 align:start position:0%
idaho western south dakota and northern
utah

01:05:06.789 --> 01:05:06.799 align:start position:0%
utah
 
01:05:08.470 --> 01:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
and when i first started going out there
 
01:05:11.910 --> 01:05:11.920 align:start position:0%
in the mid 70s it was a viable forest
 
01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:13.029 align:start position:0%
in the mid 70s it was a viable forest
industry

01:05:13.029 --> 01:05:13.039 align:start position:0%
industry
 
01:05:13.039 --> 01:05:14.150 align:start position:0%
industry
um

01:05:14.150 --> 01:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:16.470 --> 01:05:16.480 align:start position:0%
at that time there was a lot of concerns
 
01:05:18.789 --> 01:05:18.799 align:start position:0%
about overcutting and road building on
 
01:05:21.109 --> 01:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
national forest land and most of the
 
01:05:23.430 --> 01:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
west is national forest
 
01:05:25.270 --> 01:05:25.280 align:start position:0%
and there was a movement and it was
 
01:05:27.270 --> 01:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
quite successful in shutting down
 
01:05:31.109 --> 01:05:31.119 align:start position:0%
harvesting on the timber areas in in the
 
01:05:33.670 --> 01:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
western side of our country
 
01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:34.950 align:start position:0%
western side of our country
and

01:05:34.950 --> 01:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:05:36.549 --> 01:05:36.559 align:start position:0%
about ten years ago
 
01:05:39.670 --> 01:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
i was coming from uh wyoming down into
 
01:05:41.829 --> 01:05:41.839 align:start position:0%
colorado and came through the uh i
 
01:05:43.349 --> 01:05:43.359 align:start position:0%
believe it was the
 
01:05:45.829 --> 01:05:45.839 align:start position:0%
white river national forest
 
01:05:49.510 --> 01:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh just north of uh steamboat springs
 
01:05:51.910 --> 01:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:05:54.390 --> 01:05:54.400 align:start position:0%
my wife and i were traveling and i said
 
01:05:55.750 --> 01:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
you can't i can't believe what i'm
 
01:05:57.109 --> 01:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
seeing there's just hundreds of
 
01:05:58.950 --> 01:05:58.960 align:start position:0%
thousands of acres of dead lodgepole
 
01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:00.309 align:start position:0%
thousands of acres of dead lodgepole
pine

01:06:00.309 --> 01:06:00.319 align:start position:0%
pine
 
01:06:02.789 --> 01:06:02.799 align:start position:0%
and i stopped at the ranger station
 
01:06:04.789 --> 01:06:04.799 align:start position:0%
and i went in and i said how can you let
 
01:06:06.870 --> 01:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
this happen he says we have no markets
 
01:06:08.789 --> 01:06:08.799 align:start position:0%
they have been successful in shutting
 
01:06:08.799 --> 01:06:09.589 align:start position:0%
they have been successful in shutting
down

01:06:09.589 --> 01:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
down
 
01:06:11.990 --> 01:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
harvesting on the
 
01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:14.480 align:start position:0%
on the national forest by different acts
 
01:06:16.549 --> 01:06:16.559 align:start position:0%
of congress
 
01:06:19.029 --> 01:06:19.039 align:start position:0%
recently if you follow the news
 
01:06:21.190 --> 01:06:21.200 align:start position:0%
uh i think it was last year that forest
 
01:06:22.630 --> 01:06:22.640 align:start position:0%
burnt up
 
01:06:26.230 --> 01:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
and over that period of time
 
01:06:27.829 --> 01:06:27.839 align:start position:0%
we put
 
01:06:29.589 --> 01:06:29.599 align:start position:0%
thousands and thousands and hundreds of
 
01:06:32.150 --> 01:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
thousands of tons of co2 back into the
 
01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:34.069 align:start position:0%
thousands of tons of co2 back into the
atmosphere

01:06:34.069 --> 01:06:34.079 align:start position:0%
atmosphere
 
01:06:35.990 --> 01:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
not only do we do that
 
01:06:38.710 --> 01:06:38.720 align:start position:0%
and add to climate change but we also
 
01:06:40.950 --> 01:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
destroyed a forest
 
01:06:42.789 --> 01:06:42.799 align:start position:0%
that takes in
 
01:06:42.799 --> 01:06:44.630 align:start position:0%
that takes in
co2

01:06:44.630 --> 01:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
co2
 
01:06:45.829 --> 01:06:45.839 align:start position:0%
and emits
 
01:06:47.829 --> 01:06:47.839 align:start position:0%
oxygen so
 
01:06:50.789 --> 01:06:50.799 align:start position:0%
the lack of of of being able to harvest
 
01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
your forest in the west has had dramatic
 
01:06:55.990 --> 01:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
effect and we can talk about climate
 
01:06:59.109 --> 01:06:59.119 align:start position:0%
change but a well-managed forest
 
01:07:00.549 --> 01:07:00.559 align:start position:0%
the amount of
 
01:07:02.150 --> 01:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
forest fires that have happened out
 
01:07:04.150 --> 01:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
there would not have happened
 
01:07:05.510 --> 01:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
because they just did not have the
 
01:07:09.430 --> 01:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
markets to go in and harvest this timber
 
01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:10.950 align:start position:0%
markets to go in and harvest this timber
so

01:07:10.950 --> 01:07:10.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:07:12.069 --> 01:07:12.079 align:start position:0%
i also
 
01:07:14.150 --> 01:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
uh when i began my career in forestry
 
01:07:16.230 --> 01:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
excuse me sir uh
 
01:07:18.630 --> 01:07:18.640 align:start position:0%
well could you uh be more specific to
 
01:07:21.510 --> 01:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
the bill your testimony i'm sorry could
 
01:07:23.430 --> 01:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
you be more specific uh with your
 
01:07:26.069 --> 01:07:26.079 align:start position:0%
testimony to the bill itself
 
01:07:29.029 --> 01:07:29.039 align:start position:0%
uh i'm trying to build to the point of
 
01:07:31.190 --> 01:07:31.200 align:start position:0%
of the importance of low-grade markets
 
01:07:33.029 --> 01:07:33.039 align:start position:0%
and and how it affects
 
01:07:33.039 --> 01:07:33.910 align:start position:0%
and and how it affects
the

01:07:33.910 --> 01:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:07:37.109 --> 01:07:37.119 align:start position:0%
the the management of our forest
 
01:07:39.829 --> 01:07:39.839 align:start position:0%
and without market conditions and and
 
01:07:41.349 --> 01:07:41.359 align:start position:0%
that's the point of time i don't want to
 
01:07:43.109 --> 01:07:43.119 align:start position:0%
get into an argument with you it's just
 
01:07:43.119 --> 01:07:44.069 align:start position:0%
get into an argument with you it's just
that

01:07:44.069 --> 01:07:44.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:07:46.789 --> 01:07:46.799 align:start position:0%
you do set up for three to five minutes
 
01:07:46.799 --> 01:07:47.510 align:start position:0%
you do set up for three to five minutes
so

01:07:47.510 --> 01:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:07:49.910 --> 01:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
i i will try to flip it up please thank
 
01:07:53.029 --> 01:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
you so i will say that in in my
 
01:07:54.549 --> 01:07:54.559 align:start position:0%
association with
 
01:07:57.430 --> 01:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
managing forest in new hampshire and in
 
01:07:59.109 --> 01:07:59.119 align:start position:0%
the northeast
 
01:07:59.119 --> 01:08:00.789 align:start position:0%
the northeast
that

01:08:00.789 --> 01:08:00.799 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:08:02.390 --> 01:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
the importance of markets and the health
 
01:08:05.510 --> 01:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
of our forest is essential and this bill
 
01:08:08.069 --> 01:08:08.079 align:start position:0%
i think helps resolve that
 
01:08:09.670 --> 01:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
today there are
 
01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:11.510 align:start position:0%
today there are
technologies

01:08:11.510 --> 01:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
technologies
 
01:08:13.670 --> 01:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
and i think others have talked to it
 
01:08:15.109 --> 01:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
that will
 
01:08:17.430 --> 01:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
take in the slow grade market i think
 
01:08:18.789 --> 01:08:18.799 align:start position:0%
this study
 
01:08:20.789 --> 01:08:20.799 align:start position:0%
will help get us there
 
01:08:23.430 --> 01:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
i think the one issue that
 
01:08:25.590 --> 01:08:25.600 align:start position:0%
needs to be addressed as you go forward
 
01:08:28.229 --> 01:08:28.239 align:start position:0%
with it is to make sure that there's the
 
01:08:28.239 --> 01:08:30.149 align:start position:0%
with it is to make sure that there's the
economic

01:08:30.149 --> 01:08:30.159 align:start position:0%
economic
 
01:08:33.910 --> 01:08:33.920 align:start position:0%
incentives for people to be able to
 
01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:34.630 align:start position:0%
incentives for people to be able to
do

01:08:34.630 --> 01:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:35.430 align:start position:0%
do
to

01:08:35.430 --> 01:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:08:37.430 --> 01:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
get the technologies working but they
 
01:08:39.430 --> 01:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
are they do exist and there are others
 
01:08:41.829 --> 01:08:41.839 align:start position:0%
that have expressed what they are and i
 
01:08:43.829 --> 01:08:43.839 align:start position:0%
hope we go forward with that
 
01:08:45.749 --> 01:08:45.759 align:start position:0%
well thank you
 
01:08:49.349 --> 01:08:49.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:52.789 --> 01:08:52.799 align:start position:0%

speaking for the

new hampshire
 
01:09:14.309 --> 01:09:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:16.309 --> 01:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman members of the
 
01:09:18.789 --> 01:09:18.799 align:start position:0%
committee my name is griffin roberge and
 
01:09:20.550 --> 01:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
i'm from the new hampshire department of
 
01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:22.309 align:start position:0%
i'm from the new hampshire department of
energy

01:09:22.309 --> 01:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
energy
 
01:09:23.829 --> 01:09:23.839 align:start position:0%
the department doesn't take a position
 
01:09:26.309 --> 01:09:26.319 align:start position:0%
on the bill we just wanted to offer a
 
01:09:29.590 --> 01:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
slight technical amendment to page 1
 
01:09:33.110 --> 01:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:35.349 --> 01:09:35.359 align:start position:0%
it requires that the director of the

last two hearings
 
01:11:43.510 --> 01:11:43.520 align:start position:0%

01:12:11.590 --> 01:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
this is a real simple
 
01:12:16.310 --> 01:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:19.110 --> 01:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
i hope you will pass it as
 
01:12:23.110 --> 01:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
we are talking just about a small
 
01:12:27.030 --> 01:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
campfire on your private property in
 
01:12:28.709 --> 01:12:28.719 align:start position:0%
your backyard with your grandkids or
 
01:12:30.950 --> 01:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
your or your children that's all this
 
01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:32.470 align:start position:0%
your or your children that's all this
does

01:12:32.470 --> 01:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
does
 
01:12:34.229 --> 01:12:34.239 align:start position:0%
so if you go to home depot
 
01:12:34.239 --> 01:12:35.430 align:start position:0%
so if you go to home depot
lowell's

01:12:35.430 --> 01:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
lowell's
 
01:12:38.229 --> 01:12:38.239 align:start position:0%
albins the local hardware store
 
01:12:40.630 --> 01:12:40.640 align:start position:0%
and buy one of those little tin buckets
 
01:12:43.590 --> 01:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
that you can put your campfire in
 
01:12:46.550 --> 01:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
the majority of people do not understand
 
01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:48.640 align:start position:0%
you have to get permission from the
 
01:12:52.070 --> 01:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
government to light that on your private
 
01:12:54.149 --> 01:12:54.159 align:start position:0%
property in your backyard with your
 
01:12:54.159 --> 01:12:56.790 align:start position:0%
property in your backyard with your
grandkids

01:12:56.790 --> 01:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:59.590 --> 01:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
because this is the third time that i've
 
01:13:01.830 --> 01:13:01.840 align:start position:0%
tried to pass this bill so i'm hoping
 
01:13:07.510 --> 01:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:09.350 --> 01:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
this does not repeal
 
01:13:12.550 --> 01:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
anything bigger than 24 inches or even
 
01:13:15.189 --> 01:13:15.199 align:start position:0%
you know about that size
 
01:13:17.350 --> 01:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
so if you want to have a big barn about
 
01:13:19.990 --> 01:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
a bonfire in the backyard or on your
 
01:13:22.310 --> 01:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
field or anywheres else you still have
 
01:13:25.270 --> 01:13:25.280 align:start position:0%
to get permission
 
01:13:27.510 --> 01:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
now the last couple hearings especially
 
01:13:29.510 --> 01:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
the first hearing i sat on the criminal
 
01:13:33.030 --> 01:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
justice committee and tried to pass this
 
01:13:36.229 --> 01:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
not criminal justice i'm sorry it was um
 
01:13:36.239 --> 01:13:37.510 align:start position:0%
not criminal justice i'm sorry it was um
municipal

01:13:37.510 --> 01:13:37.520 align:start position:0%
municipal
 
01:13:39.189 --> 01:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
in county government is that where the
 
01:13:41.590 --> 01:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
back in 2010 when this bill about 11
 
01:13:44.790 --> 01:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
when this bill first came through
 
01:13:47.669 --> 01:13:47.679 align:start position:0%
according to the chiefs of police
 
01:13:50.550 --> 01:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
they estimate 70 to 75 of not police
 
01:13:51.830 --> 01:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
fire chiefs
 
01:13:54.709 --> 01:13:54.719 align:start position:0%
they estimate 70 to 75 percent of people
 
01:13:57.189 --> 01:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
do not get a permit
 
01:13:58.550 --> 01:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
you know that's just a guess but that's
 
01:14:00.870 --> 01:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
what they said
 
01:14:02.630 --> 01:14:02.640 align:start position:0%
because really most people don't realize
 
01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:10.310 --> 01:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
what i look at is new york state
 
01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
repealed theirs several years ago
 
01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
and i'm looking at if new york will do
 
01:14:23.110 --> 01:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:24.870 --> 01:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
and if you noticed i don't know if any
 
01:14:26.390 --> 01:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
of you have driven over to new york it's
 
01:14:27.669 --> 01:14:27.679 align:start position:0%
been about four years since they
 
01:14:30.070 --> 01:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
repealed this camp fire permit so if you
 
01:14:32.310 --> 01:14:32.320 align:start position:0%
have a big camp you know a big bonfire
 
01:14:33.669 --> 01:14:33.679 align:start position:0%
you still have to get a permit from your
 
01:14:36.070 --> 01:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
local fire department
 
01:14:38.709 --> 01:14:38.719 align:start position:0%
campfires you don't in new york and if
 
01:14:40.310 --> 01:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
anybody's driven through new york in the
 
01:14:42.470 --> 01:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
last four or five years when they passed
 
01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:43.270 align:start position:0%
last four or five years when they passed
this

01:14:43.270 --> 01:14:43.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:14:44.790 --> 01:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
it's still standing
 
01:14:46.390 --> 01:14:46.400 align:start position:0%
it's not burnt down because that's what
 
01:14:47.669 --> 01:14:47.679 align:start position:0%
you're going to hear from the people
 
01:14:50.149 --> 01:14:50.159 align:start position:0%
behind me if they come up and testify
 
01:14:52.310 --> 01:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
that if we pass this the whole state of
 
01:14:54.390 --> 01:14:54.400 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is going to be gone
 
01:14:57.590 --> 01:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
because it will burn down
 
01:14:59.110 --> 01:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
i trust my neighbors with their
 
01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:01.510 align:start position:0%
i trust my neighbors with their
campfires

01:15:01.510 --> 01:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
campfires
 
01:15:03.270 --> 01:15:03.280 align:start position:0%
now the big giant fire that they have
 
01:15:05.590 --> 01:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
occasionally yeah okay maybe the fire
 
01:15:07.350 --> 01:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
department should know
 
01:15:09.030 --> 01:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
just in case
 
01:15:10.709 --> 01:15:10.719 align:start position:0%
but they still haven't burnt my house
 
01:15:13.189 --> 01:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
down so i'm happy
 
01:15:14.950 --> 01:15:14.960 align:start position:0%
but those little campfires when they
 
01:15:16.630 --> 01:15:16.640 align:start position:0%
have their little daughter out there my
 
01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:18.149 align:start position:0%
have their little daughter out there my
neighbor

01:15:18.149 --> 01:15:18.159 align:start position:0%
neighbor
 
01:15:19.350 --> 01:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
it isn't going to get away from them
 
01:15:22.149 --> 01:15:22.159 align:start position:0%
because it's in one of those 10 things
 
01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
you know they're very good just like i
 
01:15:25.510 --> 01:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
am just like you guys are just like
 
01:15:26.790 --> 01:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
everybody is
 
01:15:30.790 --> 01:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:32.149 --> 01:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
now you're also going to hear about the
 
01:15:34.149 --> 01:15:34.159 align:start position:0%
fire stands
 
01:15:35.990 --> 01:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
you know up north i i don't know if we
 
01:15:37.669 --> 01:15:37.679 align:start position:0%
have any down this way but i know up
 
01:15:40.070 --> 01:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
north they have a few fire stands up by
 
01:15:42.149 --> 01:15:42.159 align:start position:0%
the lake region i think there's one and
 
01:15:43.830 --> 01:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
what they do is they look out and look
 
01:15:46.630 --> 01:15:46.640 align:start position:0%
for fires so that way and dry
 
01:15:49.270 --> 01:15:49.280 align:start position:0%
excuse me so during dry times they can
 
01:15:50.709 --> 01:15:50.719 align:start position:0%
say oh there's a fire over there and
 
01:15:51.910 --> 01:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
they can look at their map and then
 
01:15:53.189 --> 01:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
they'll call the fire department and
 
01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
they'll somebody will run over there and
 
01:15:56.709 --> 01:15:56.719 align:start position:0%
say hey what's going on
 
01:16:00.070 --> 01:16:00.080 align:start position:0%
well that's usually with a big bonfire
 
01:16:02.630 --> 01:16:02.640 align:start position:0%
these little fires
 
01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:03.669 align:start position:0%
these little fires
in

01:16:03.669 --> 01:16:03.679 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:16:05.110 --> 01:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
my neighborhood
 
01:16:06.950 --> 01:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
and from what i when i talk to my
 
01:16:09.189 --> 01:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
friends in their neighborhoods is mostly
 
01:16:10.310 --> 01:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
at night
 
01:16:11.669 --> 01:16:11.679 align:start position:0%
so these fire stations aren't going to
 
01:16:14.070 --> 01:16:14.080 align:start position:0%
see them anyways
 
01:16:15.669 --> 01:16:15.679 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure if you could see a
 
01:16:20.229 --> 01:16:20.239 align:start position:0%
small campfire you know 12 15 inches
 
01:16:20.239 --> 01:16:21.110 align:start position:0%
small campfire you know 12 15 inches
fire

01:16:21.110 --> 01:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
fire
 
01:16:23.030 --> 01:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
you know a couple miles away it's only
 
01:16:24.229 --> 01:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
the big ones
 
01:16:27.350 --> 01:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
so you will hear about that
 
01:16:34.550 --> 01:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:37.910 --> 01:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
i'm sure you are aware that
 
01:16:41.030 --> 01:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
we have hot dog day
 
01:16:44.070 --> 01:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
and that's where this came from
 
01:16:45.990 --> 01:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
i was a brand new rep got on the house
 
01:16:48.149 --> 01:16:48.159 align:start position:0%
floor and i told everybody if you vote
 
01:16:49.590 --> 01:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
with me
 
01:16:52.550 --> 01:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
i'll give you a hot dog
 
01:16:54.950 --> 01:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
and have a campfire without a permit
 
01:16:58.550 --> 01:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
well i realize you can't bribe reps
 
01:17:00.070 --> 01:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
so i learned something that day that i
 
01:17:04.870 --> 01:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:07.590 --> 01:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
but since then i invite everybody to hot
 
01:17:09.350 --> 01:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
dog day
 
01:17:11.189 --> 01:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
and when we have that campfire permit
 
01:17:12.950 --> 01:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
outside out in the front of the new
 
01:17:15.590 --> 01:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire state house
 
01:17:16.390 --> 01:17:16.400 align:start position:0%
it is
 
01:17:18.950 --> 01:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
without a permit
 
01:17:20.709 --> 01:17:20.719 align:start position:0%
i have never got a permit because we
 
01:17:22.310 --> 01:17:22.320 align:start position:0%
don't need one here
 
01:17:24.950 --> 01:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
now i did have some fights with the city
 
01:17:26.950 --> 01:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
but since then we have patched up and
 
01:17:29.110 --> 01:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
now we hug and we're good friends
 
01:17:30.790 --> 01:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
so the city understands that i'm not
 
01:17:33.030 --> 01:17:33.040 align:start position:0%
getting a permit for hot dog day
 
01:17:34.870 --> 01:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
matter of fact i even invite them over
 
01:17:37.669 --> 01:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:39.510 --> 01:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
so everything's going to be okay if this
 
01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:42.149 align:start position:0%
so everything's going to be okay if this
passes

01:17:42.149 --> 01:17:42.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:45.350 --> 01:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
i'll state my name on that
 
01:17:49.189 --> 01:17:49.199 align:start position:0%
so i want to go back to again and
 
01:17:51.189 --> 01:17:51.199 align:start position:0%
to new york
 
01:17:55.189 --> 01:17:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:56.830 --> 01:17:56.840 align:start position:0%
the city of
 
01:17:58.790 --> 01:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
albany and
 
01:18:01.350 --> 01:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
the good reps there and the senators and
 
01:18:03.270 --> 01:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
the governor can say you know what we
 
01:18:06.229 --> 01:18:06.239 align:start position:0%
need to get rid of it there
 
01:18:07.750 --> 01:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
we really got to get rid of it in new
 
01:18:10.709 --> 01:18:10.719 align:start position:0%
hampshire they'll live free or die state
 
01:18:13.189 --> 01:18:13.199 align:start position:0%
because there's no need
 
01:18:16.149 --> 01:18:16.159 align:start position:0%
for anybody to be forced into on their
 
01:18:19.270 --> 01:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
private property
 
01:18:21.590 --> 01:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
to have to call the government and say i
 
01:18:23.510 --> 01:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
would like a little campfire out back so
 
01:18:25.270 --> 01:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
i can have my grandkids over and we can
 
01:18:27.830 --> 01:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
toast marshmallows and a hot dog
 
01:18:30.310 --> 01:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
there's just no need for it
 
01:18:31.750 --> 01:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
because i'm not going to burn my house
 
01:18:33.430 --> 01:18:33.440 align:start position:0%
down i'm not burning my neighbor's house
 
01:18:35.030 --> 01:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
down and my neighbors haven't burnt mine
 
01:18:38.630 --> 01:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
down it just isn't going to happen
 
01:18:40.709 --> 01:18:40.719 align:start position:0%
again the big fires
 
01:18:42.149 --> 01:18:42.159 align:start position:0%
we aren't even talking about those
 
01:18:44.390 --> 01:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
because that is not in the bill
 
01:18:46.950 --> 01:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
if you look down in the bill
 
01:18:50.630 --> 01:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
it says camp or cooking fires may be uh
 
01:18:52.870 --> 01:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
built without permission this is on uh
 
01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:54.390 align:start position:0%
built without permission this is on uh
uh

01:18:54.390 --> 01:18:54.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:18:56.310 --> 01:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
some public campgrounds
 
01:18:58.790 --> 01:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
in picnic grounds areas so they're
 
01:19:00.229 --> 01:19:00.239 align:start position:0%
already doing it without a permit in
 
01:19:01.669 --> 01:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
some areas
 
01:19:04.950 --> 01:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
i just want to extend that to your
 
01:19:08.310 --> 01:19:08.320 align:start position:0%
private property in your backyard
 
01:19:11.110 --> 01:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
so i hope you will pass this and
 
01:19:18.070 --> 01:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:19.590 --> 01:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
any questions from members of the
 
01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:21.669 align:start position:0%
any questions from members of the
committee

01:19:21.669 --> 01:19:21.679 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:19:24.149 --> 01:19:24.159 align:start position:0%
representative gould for a question
 
01:19:26.550 --> 01:19:26.560 align:start position:0%
followed by representatives thank you mr
 
01:19:29.189 --> 01:19:29.199 align:start position:0%

chairman and uh thank you representative
um

01:19:30.310 --> 01:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:32.630 --> 01:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
does this include those metal dishes
 
01:19:34.550 --> 01:19:34.560 align:start position:0%
that you put a fire in that you need a
 
01:19:37.189 --> 01:19:37.199 align:start position:0%
permit for
 
01:19:39.270 --> 01:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
from what i understand and thank you for
 
01:19:40.310 --> 01:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
the question
 
01:19:41.990 --> 01:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
from what i understand if if you go to
 
01:19:43.990 --> 01:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
the hardware store or anywheres and or
 
01:19:46.550 --> 01:19:46.560 align:start position:0%
online you order these metal buckets you
 
01:19:49.510 --> 01:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
know to put a campfire in
 
01:19:51.510 --> 01:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
technically you are supposed to get a
 
01:19:54.870 --> 01:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:57.270 --> 01:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
nobody i know does
 
01:19:59.110 --> 01:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
and uh you know so that's why i'm saying
 
01:20:01.350 --> 01:20:01.360 align:start position:0%
is i just want to clean the language up
 
01:20:02.830 --> 01:20:02.840 align:start position:0%
that it's not
 
01:20:05.590 --> 01:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
necessary and again you know this was uh
 
01:20:07.750 --> 01:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
really during the first hearing they did
 
01:20:10.229 --> 01:20:10.239 align:start position:0%
talk of it in the second here and uh you
 
01:20:11.910 --> 01:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
know the second try of this this is my
 
01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:13.030 align:start position:0%
know the second try of this this is my
third

01:20:13.030 --> 01:20:13.040 align:start position:0%
third
 
01:20:14.870 --> 01:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
that 70 to 75 percent of the people
 
01:20:18.390 --> 01:20:18.400 align:start position:0%
don't realize they're supposed to get it
 
01:20:21.350 --> 01:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
you know a permit thank you thank you
 
01:20:23.350 --> 01:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
representative smith for a question
 
01:20:24.709 --> 01:20:24.719 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
01:20:26.870 --> 01:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
01:20:30.870 --> 01:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
i understand the uh wanting to have a
 
01:20:33.590 --> 01:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
barbecue or campfire in your backyard in
 
01:20:35.350 --> 01:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
one of the metal dishes
 
01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:36.070 align:start position:0%
one of the metal dishes
but

01:20:36.070 --> 01:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:20:38.390 --> 01:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
um can you show me where in the bill it
 
01:20:40.790 --> 01:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
says it is limited to backyards because
 
01:20:42.310 --> 01:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
the way i read it
 
01:20:44.550 --> 01:20:44.560 align:start position:0%
i could get permission from a landowner
 
01:20:45.990 --> 01:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
and they're like oh yeah sure do
 
01:20:47.750 --> 01:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
whatever you want and i'm hiking back in
 
01:20:49.910 --> 01:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
the woods with my grandchild and
 
01:20:52.870 --> 01:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
building a campfire and then leave it
 
01:20:54.470 --> 01:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
and then the fire goes down into the
 
01:20:57.669 --> 01:20:57.679 align:start position:0%
duff and can cause a larger fire after
 
01:20:59.830 --> 01:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
i'm gone so i don't i don't see anywhere
 
01:21:02.229 --> 01:21:02.239 align:start position:0%
here where it limits it to that
 
01:21:03.910 --> 01:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
what the instance you're talking about
 
01:21:06.390 --> 01:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
could you explain that to me thank you
 
01:21:08.790 --> 01:21:08.800 align:start position:0%
for the test uh your question absolutely
 
01:21:12.070 --> 01:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:13.990 --> 01:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
you know can you do what you just
 
01:21:16.070 --> 01:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
explained absolutely you could
 
01:21:19.030 --> 01:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
but the majority of campfires are in
 
01:21:21.750 --> 01:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
backyards there are the occasional one
 
01:21:23.590 --> 01:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
up you know that people go in the woods
 
01:21:27.270 --> 01:21:27.280 align:start position:0%
and and start their campfire
 
01:21:29.510 --> 01:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
and let me look here okay it says right
 
01:21:31.750 --> 01:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
here you know and i don't have the bill
 
01:21:33.030 --> 01:21:33.040 align:start position:0%
you know i just copied this off the
 
01:21:34.470 --> 01:21:34.480 align:start position:0%
internet so i don't have the actual
 
01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:35.430 align:start position:0%
internet so i don't have the actual
lines

01:21:35.430 --> 01:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
lines
 
01:21:37.750 --> 01:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
but it's toward the end it says whoever
 
01:21:41.189 --> 01:21:41.199 align:start position:0%
shall kindle or cause to be kindled any
 
01:21:43.750 --> 01:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
such fire or use
 
01:21:47.189 --> 01:21:47.199 align:start position:0%
an abandoned fire or in near wood lands
 
01:21:49.590 --> 01:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
as you're talking shall totally
 
01:21:51.990 --> 01:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
extinguish the uh
 
01:21:54.709 --> 01:21:54.719 align:start position:0%
the same before leaving so it's in law
 
01:21:56.709 --> 01:21:56.719 align:start position:0%
that you have to put that fire out and
 
01:21:58.550 --> 01:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
it says that if you don't it says
 
01:22:01.030 --> 01:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
failure to do so you're going to be held
 
01:22:03.590 --> 01:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
personally liable
 
01:22:05.750 --> 01:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
so that's already statute and that will
 
01:22:07.669 --> 01:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
not be repealed the only thing that's
 
01:22:09.189 --> 01:22:09.199 align:start position:0%
going to be repealed is written
 
01:22:12.229 --> 01:22:12.239 align:start position:0%
permission from the the government
 
01:22:13.590 --> 01:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
you know so i don't have to call the
 
01:22:16.070 --> 01:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
fire department in bed chances are if
 
01:22:18.790 --> 01:22:18.800 align:start position:0%
you go to the local you know force that
 
01:22:20.629 --> 01:22:20.639 align:start position:0%
you want to go to or wherever you say
 
01:22:22.470 --> 01:22:22.480 align:start position:0%
the scenario is
 
01:22:23.910 --> 01:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
you know to your friend that has a lot
 
01:22:25.270 --> 01:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
of land
 
01:22:26.550 --> 01:22:26.560 align:start position:0%
chances are you're not going to call the
 
01:22:28.070 --> 01:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
fire department you're going to go with
 
01:22:30.310 --> 01:22:30.320 align:start position:0%
your child go out back and and build
 
01:22:31.910 --> 01:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
that fire
 
01:22:34.149 --> 01:22:34.159 align:start position:0%
i can't imagine you you know anybody
 
01:22:36.310 --> 01:22:36.320 align:start position:0%
doing that scenario and then calling the
 
01:22:37.990 --> 01:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
fire department and say okay i'm way up
 
01:22:40.070 --> 01:22:40.080 align:start position:0%

around and i have a campfire that i want
 
01:22:43.189 --> 01:22:43.199 align:start position:0%
to start but you need to come up and
 
01:22:45.270 --> 01:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
give me permission first that's not
 
01:22:46.950 --> 01:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
going to happen
 
01:22:48.550 --> 01:22:48.560 align:start position:0%

are you are you aware that um the
 
01:22:58.229 --> 01:22:58.239 align:start position:0%
permits can be applied for beforehand
 
01:23:00.870 --> 01:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
and online also
 
01:23:05.030 --> 01:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:10.550 --> 01:23:10.560 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chair and thank you john um

thank you representative
 
01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:18.470 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
um

01:23:18.470 --> 01:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:21.990 --> 01:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
my question is the funds that are used
 
01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:23.990 align:start position:0%
my question is the funds that are used
um

01:23:23.990 --> 01:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:25.669 --> 01:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
do you know how the funds are used that
 
01:23:28.550 --> 01:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
they collect for these permits
 
01:23:31.910 --> 01:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
i believe the permit's free
 
01:23:34.229 --> 01:23:34.239 align:start position:0%
but it's still that you have to ask for
 
01:23:37.590 --> 01:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
permission and then like in goffstown
 
01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:39.990 align:start position:0%
permission and then like in goffstown
um

01:23:39.990 --> 01:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:41.030 --> 01:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:23:43.030 --> 01:23:43.040 align:start position:0%
hopefully the goffstown's not watching
 
01:23:45.030 --> 01:23:45.040 align:start position:0%
but i don't want the permit
 
01:23:47.270 --> 01:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:23:49.030 --> 01:23:49.040 align:start position:0%
so they
 
01:23:52.149 --> 01:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
they would have to come on my property
 
01:23:55.669 --> 01:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
and and i wish not to have that
 
01:23:57.750 --> 01:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
you know because i'm not gonna harm my
 
01:23:57.760 --> 01:24:00.470 align:start position:0%
you know because i'm not gonna harm my
neighbors

01:24:00.470 --> 01:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:01.910 --> 01:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
you know so you know i just you know
 
01:24:04.149 --> 01:24:04.159 align:start position:0%
it's just one way to to clean up the
 
01:24:06.310 --> 01:24:06.320 align:start position:0%
language and to not have to ask the
 
01:24:07.990 --> 01:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
government for something that is
 
01:24:14.310 --> 01:24:14.320 align:start position:0%

requirements for campgrounds as you just
 
01:26:12.229 --> 01:26:12.239 align:start position:0%
heard it may repeal the permit

requirements for all category 1 and 2
 
01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:16.470 align:start position:0%

in the state
 
01:26:20.550 --> 01:26:20.560 align:start position:0%
this comprises approximately 72 percent

of the permits issued each year
 
01:26:28.550 --> 01:26:28.560 align:start position:0%

with a permit issued on a seasonal basis
 
01:26:46.229 --> 01:26:46.239 align:start position:0%
uh the difference between category one
 
01:26:48.229 --> 01:26:48.239 align:start position:0%
and two fires although they're both
 
01:26:52.470 --> 01:26:52.480 align:start position:0%
campfires a category 1 fire is up to 24

inches in diameter and a category 2 fire
 
01:26:59.590 --> 01:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
can be up to 48 inches in diameter
 
01:27:02.870 --> 01:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
the language in house bill 1555 repeals
 
01:27:04.790 --> 01:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
the permit requirement for camping
 
01:27:07.590 --> 01:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
cooking fires without specifying whether
 
01:27:10.310 --> 01:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
this is for all camper cooking fires or
 
01:27:14.149 --> 01:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
just those within campgrounds
 
01:27:15.910 --> 01:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
fire permits have been required in new
 
01:27:18.709 --> 01:27:18.719 align:start position:0%
hampshire since 1911. and were put in
 
01:27:20.629 --> 01:27:20.639 align:start position:0%
place to reduce fire occurrence during
 
01:27:22.709 --> 01:27:22.719 align:start position:0%
periods of high fire danger
 
01:27:25.030 --> 01:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
and to reduce carelessness with fire by
 
01:27:27.669 --> 01:27:27.679 align:start position:0%
educating the public
 
01:27:29.669 --> 01:27:29.679 align:start position:0%
the current fire permit system offers
 
01:27:31.669 --> 01:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
both a paper permit
 
01:27:33.990 --> 01:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
and an online permit option for
 
01:27:37.030 --> 01:27:37.040 align:start position:0%
obtaining the fire permit and it can be
 
01:27:39.910 --> 01:27:39.920 align:start position:0%
obtained both online as well as from
 
01:27:42.229 --> 01:27:42.239 align:start position:0%
your local fire department and from the
 
01:27:45.350 --> 01:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
local forest fire warden at no cost and
 
01:27:49.590 --> 01:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
again on a seasonal yearly basis
 
01:27:51.510 --> 01:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
the issuance of the fire permits gives
 
01:27:53.590 --> 01:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
the fire officials the opportunity to
 
01:27:55.110 --> 01:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
educate the public
 
01:27:57.910 --> 01:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
about safe burning and reduces fires
 
01:28:00.470 --> 01:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
during periods of high fire danger on
 
01:28:02.070 --> 01:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
the local level
 
01:28:04.629 --> 01:28:04.639 align:start position:0%
the fire permit system also allows for
 
01:28:07.270 --> 01:28:07.280 align:start position:0%
fire officials to know where fires are
 
01:28:09.510 --> 01:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
occurring thus preventing them from
 
01:28:12.790 --> 01:28:12.800 align:start position:0%
responding with all of their apparatus
 
01:28:16.550 --> 01:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:18.070 --> 01:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
the issue
 
01:28:20.070 --> 01:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
campgrounds in new hampshire are
 
01:28:22.229 --> 01:28:22.239 align:start position:0%
currently required to obtain one
 
01:28:25.189 --> 01:28:25.199 align:start position:0%
seasonal fire permit for the entire
 
01:28:27.590 --> 01:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
campground for the year
 
01:28:29.830 --> 01:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
the fire location is required to meet
 
01:28:31.510 --> 01:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
the following specifications in
 
01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:33.030 align:start position:0%
the following specifications in
campgrounds

01:28:33.030 --> 01:28:33.040 align:start position:0%
campgrounds
 
01:28:35.510 --> 01:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
it has to be on an area cleaned
 
01:28:38.149 --> 01:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
to mineral soil
 
01:28:40.390 --> 01:28:40.400 align:start position:0%
at least eight feet across
 
01:28:42.790 --> 01:28:42.800 align:start position:0%
it has to have at least six inches of
 
01:28:45.990 --> 01:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
sand or gravel under the fire for any
 
01:28:48.870 --> 01:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
fire that's built on the ground
 
01:28:51.990 --> 01:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh limbs uh and burnable material have
 
01:28:53.830 --> 01:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
to be cleared 10 feet above where the
 
01:28:56.629 --> 01:28:56.639 align:start position:0%
fire is going to be located and the fire
 
01:28:59.189 --> 01:28:59.199 align:start position:0%
has to be in a fire resistive ring that
 
01:29:03.189 --> 01:29:03.199 align:start position:0%
can't be moved from that safe area
 
01:29:05.830 --> 01:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
the division of forest lands understands
 
01:29:07.669 --> 01:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
how important camp fires are to
 
01:29:09.430 --> 01:29:09.440 align:start position:0%
campgrounds it's part of their business
 
01:29:11.350 --> 01:29:11.360 align:start position:0%
model we understand that
 
01:29:13.350 --> 01:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
and for that reason and because of the
 
01:29:16.950 --> 01:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
extra precautions that i just mentioned
 
01:29:19.350 --> 01:29:19.360 align:start position:0%
the division allows campgrounds to
 
01:29:21.510 --> 01:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
continue burning during periods of high
 
01:29:22.790 --> 01:29:22.800 align:start position:0%
fire danger
 
01:29:25.270 --> 01:29:25.280 align:start position:0%
even when there are prohibitions put on
 
01:29:29.669 --> 01:29:29.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:31.910 --> 01:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
we believe that repealing the fire
 
01:29:34.149 --> 01:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
permit requirement will increase fire
 
01:29:36.310 --> 01:29:36.320 align:start position:0%
occurrence in new hampshire
 
01:29:38.790 --> 01:29:38.800 align:start position:0%
uh it will increase the burden on local
 
01:29:42.149 --> 01:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
fire departments municipal expenses and
 
01:29:44.070 --> 01:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
increase the risk to both property and
 
01:29:46.629 --> 01:29:46.639 align:start position:0%
lives during wildfires
 
01:29:49.189 --> 01:29:49.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to testify
 
01:29:51.110 --> 01:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
if i can provide any additional
 
01:29:59.110 --> 01:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:01.350 --> 01:30:01.360 align:start position:0%
representative gould for a question okay
 
01:30:03.189 --> 01:30:03.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you uh
 
01:30:07.189 --> 01:30:07.199 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um let me see
 
01:30:08.390 --> 01:30:08.400 align:start position:0%
so a
 
01:30:11.350 --> 01:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
a private homeowner can get a permit for
 
01:30:13.669 --> 01:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
the whole year
 
01:30:15.510 --> 01:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
correct and that is free
 
01:30:17.189 --> 01:30:17.199 align:start position:0%
it's a free permit
 
01:30:17.199 --> 01:30:18.310 align:start position:0%
it's a free permit
issued

01:30:18.310 --> 01:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
issued
 
01:30:20.149 --> 01:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
category one and two permits these
 
01:30:23.110 --> 01:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
campfires it's a seasonal permit which
 
01:30:25.189 --> 01:30:25.199 align:start position:0%
is good from the date the permits
 
01:30:27.830 --> 01:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
obtained through december 31st okay
 
01:30:32.830 --> 01:30:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:35.910 --> 01:30:35.920 align:start position:0%
representative huff for a question
 
01:30:37.590 --> 01:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
01:30:39.189 --> 01:30:39.199 align:start position:0%
taking my question thank you for coming
 
01:30:41.669 --> 01:30:41.679 align:start position:0%
out um you mentioned that there were
 
01:30:43.110 --> 01:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
rules um
 
01:30:44.390 --> 01:30:44.400 align:start position:0%
in place
 
01:30:46.390 --> 01:30:46.400 align:start position:0%
such as cleaning out the you know the
 
01:30:49.110 --> 01:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
area making sure my question is are
 
01:30:51.270 --> 01:30:51.280 align:start position:0%
those rules only in place
 
01:30:54.070 --> 01:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
when in conjunction with a fire permit
 
01:30:55.910 --> 01:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
or would they be there regardless if
 
01:30:58.790 --> 01:30:58.800 align:start position:0%
there was a fire permit or not
 
01:31:00.950 --> 01:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
currently the
 
01:31:04.070 --> 01:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
state statute which governs campgrounds
 
01:31:06.149 --> 01:31:06.159 align:start position:0%
does specify
 
01:31:08.470 --> 01:31:08.480 align:start position:0%
that it's there for campgrounds
 
01:31:09.669 --> 01:31:09.679 align:start position:0%
part of that
 
01:31:12.229 --> 01:31:12.239 align:start position:0%
rule part of that rsa also states that
 
01:31:14.709 --> 01:31:14.719 align:start position:0%
campgrounds have to get a permit
 
01:31:17.270 --> 01:31:17.280 align:start position:0%
so within our rules the forest fire
 
01:31:19.590 --> 01:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
rules uh those specifications are
 
01:31:21.910 --> 01:31:21.920 align:start position:0%
written into rules for the
 
01:31:21.920 --> 01:31:23.110 align:start position:0%
written into rules for the
campgrounds

01:31:23.110 --> 01:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
campgrounds
 
01:31:25.110 --> 01:31:25.120 align:start position:0%
so they go hand in hand hand in hand
 
01:31:27.669 --> 01:31:27.679 align:start position:0%
okay follow up for a follow-up so would
 
01:31:30.149 --> 01:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
there be a conflict
 
01:31:31.270 --> 01:31:31.280 align:start position:0%
do you think there would be a conflict
 
01:31:32.950 --> 01:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
or would that rule have to be addressed
 
01:31:34.550 --> 01:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
also if
 
01:31:37.189 --> 01:31:37.199 align:start position:0%
for example if this were to take place
 
01:31:39.189 --> 01:31:39.199 align:start position:0%
i believe we would have to address the
 
01:31:41.030 --> 01:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
rules and
 
01:31:46.629 --> 01:31:46.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:48.870 --> 01:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
representative gould for a second time
 
01:31:51.350 --> 01:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
okay thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
01:31:53.350 --> 01:31:53.360 align:start position:0%
again um
 
01:31:55.750 --> 01:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
let me see uh
 
01:31:58.629 --> 01:31:58.639 align:start position:0%
does the inspector come to my property
 
01:31:59.910 --> 01:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
to check where i'm going to have the
 
01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:01.669 align:start position:0%
to check where i'm going to have the
fire

01:32:01.669 --> 01:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
fire
 
01:32:03.990 --> 01:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
not in all cases
 
01:32:06.629 --> 01:32:06.639 align:start position:0%
many times especially online
 
01:32:08.950 --> 01:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
if somebody obtains the fire permit they
 
01:32:11.750 --> 01:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
just check off the affidavit
 
01:32:13.350 --> 01:32:13.360 align:start position:0%
saying that they understand the rules
 
01:32:14.709 --> 01:32:14.719 align:start position:0%
and the laws
 
01:32:17.030 --> 01:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
the local forest fire warden does have
 
01:32:19.750 --> 01:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
the authority to enter onto the property
 
01:32:22.390 --> 01:32:22.400 align:start position:0%
to check the burn location
 
01:32:24.629 --> 01:32:24.639 align:start position:0%
but that isn't always the case even when
 
01:32:26.470 --> 01:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
a paper permit is issued at the fire
 
01:32:29.430 --> 01:32:29.440 align:start position:0%
department or by the local warden they
 
01:32:32.950 --> 01:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
don't always conduct a site inspection
 
01:32:36.629 --> 01:32:36.639 align:start position:0%
sometimes tuftonboro for example i know
 
01:32:39.270 --> 01:32:39.280 align:start position:0%
does a site inspection the first time
 
01:32:41.990 --> 01:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
they issue that seasonal permit and then
 
01:32:44.629 --> 01:32:44.639 align:start position:0%
every year after as long as nothing's
 
01:32:46.629 --> 01:32:46.639 align:start position:0%
changed with the site they just issue
 
01:32:53.030 --> 01:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:55.590 --> 01:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
represent representative gottlieb
 
01:32:58.709 --> 01:32:58.719 align:start position:0%
for a question thank you um do you have
 
01:33:02.709 --> 01:33:02.719 align:start position:0%
any uh statistics on the number of fires
 
01:33:03.990 --> 01:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
that occur
 
01:33:06.070 --> 01:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
either in the cities towns or in the
 
01:33:06.080 --> 01:33:06.950 align:start position:0%
either in the cities towns or in the
state

01:33:06.950 --> 01:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:33:08.390 --> 01:33:08.400 align:start position:0%
from small
 
01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:09.110 align:start position:0%
from small
or

01:33:09.110 --> 01:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:33:11.669 --> 01:33:11.679 align:start position:0%
from campfires
 
01:33:15.590 --> 01:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
yes i do have um some statistics we do
 
01:33:19.590 --> 01:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
not receive all um fire reports but the
 
01:33:21.830 --> 01:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
ones we do receive
 
01:33:21.840 --> 01:33:23.430 align:start position:0%
ones we do receive
campfires

01:33:23.430 --> 01:33:23.440 align:start position:0%
campfires
 
01:33:24.790 --> 01:33:24.800 align:start position:0%
account for
 
01:33:27.590 --> 01:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
approximately 35 to 40 percent of the
 
01:33:30.870 --> 01:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
wildfires in new hampshire
 
01:33:33.270 --> 01:33:33.280 align:start position:0%
in 2020 you may recall we had a drought
 
01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:34.709 align:start position:0%
in 2020 you may recall we had a drought
situation

01:33:34.709 --> 01:33:34.719 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:33:34.719 --> 01:33:35.750 align:start position:0%
situation
and

01:33:35.750 --> 01:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:33:38.390 --> 01:33:38.400 align:start position:0%
that's when we started seeing a lot of
 
01:33:40.709 --> 01:33:40.719 align:start position:0%
remote campfires
 
01:33:43.270 --> 01:33:43.280 align:start position:0%
which turned into wildfires that took a
 
01:33:44.629 --> 01:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
lot of time
 
01:33:46.310 --> 01:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
to suppress
 
01:33:54.310 --> 01:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:55.590 --> 01:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
01:33:57.990 --> 01:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
uh i i do have a question a question or
 
01:34:00.149 --> 01:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
two um
 
01:34:01.430 --> 01:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
01:34:05.189 --> 01:34:05.199 align:start position:0%
get my he uh my brain around what
 
01:34:08.070 --> 01:34:08.080 align:start position:0%
constitutes a campfire and what is legal
 
01:34:10.070 --> 01:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
and what requires a permit and what
 
01:34:14.310 --> 01:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't does a grill require a permit
 
01:34:18.229 --> 01:34:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:20.950 --> 01:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
outdoor cooking facility require a
 
01:34:20.960 --> 01:34:22.149 align:start position:0%
outdoor cooking facility require a
permit

01:34:22.149 --> 01:34:22.159 align:start position:0%
permit
 
01:34:24.870 --> 01:34:24.880 align:start position:0%
uh there are these
 
01:34:24.880 --> 01:34:26.470 align:start position:0%
uh there are these
circular

01:34:26.470 --> 01:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
circular
 
01:34:28.070 --> 01:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
circles of uh
 
01:34:30.550 --> 01:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
uh that you that you buy at home depot
 
01:34:32.629 --> 01:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
that have uh
 
01:34:34.470 --> 01:34:34.480 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:34:36.950 --> 01:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
bricks that you line up in a circle and
 
01:34:40.070 --> 01:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
you have a a bowl like uh
 
01:34:42.629 --> 01:34:42.639 align:start position:0%
device that you put wood in does that
 
01:34:45.350 --> 01:34:45.360 align:start position:0%
require a permit there are these
 
01:34:48.790 --> 01:34:48.800 align:start position:0%
ge anything powered with gas outside
 
01:34:51.189 --> 01:34:51.199 align:start position:0%
does that require a permit
 
01:34:51.199 --> 01:34:52.149 align:start position:0%
does that require a permit
i'm

01:34:52.149 --> 01:34:52.159 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
01:34:53.830 --> 01:34:53.840 align:start position:0%
i'm not certain what
 
01:34:55.590 --> 01:34:55.600 align:start position:0%
uh what requires a permit and what
 
01:34:55.600 --> 01:34:56.550 align:start position:0%
uh what requires a permit and what
doesn't

01:34:56.550 --> 01:34:56.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
01:34:59.590 --> 01:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um charcoal
 
01:35:01.830 --> 01:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
and gas grills those things they they do
 
01:35:04.390 --> 01:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
not require a fire permit uh the fire
 
01:35:05.990 --> 01:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
permit is for
 
01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:06.870 align:start position:0%
permit is for
um

01:35:06.870 --> 01:35:06.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:10.470 --> 01:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
the burning of of wood uh in a device
 
01:35:13.109 --> 01:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
which does not have a chimney um which
 
01:35:14.950 --> 01:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
is not enclosed
 
01:35:16.550 --> 01:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
so those
 
01:35:19.990 --> 01:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
circular brick with the metal insert
 
01:35:22.070 --> 01:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
they're open flames so they would
 
01:35:24.310 --> 01:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
require a permit
 
01:35:26.709 --> 01:35:26.719 align:start position:0%
also no permit is required if there is
 
01:35:29.189 --> 01:35:29.199 align:start position:0%
snow on the ground the fire permit is
 
01:35:30.870 --> 01:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
tied directly to
 
01:35:33.430 --> 01:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
wildfires and protecting the woodlands
 
01:35:39.590 --> 01:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:40.950 --> 01:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:35:42.950 --> 01:35:42.960 align:start position:0%

has a fire chief and or a forest warden
 
01:36:34.870 --> 01:36:34.880 align:start position:0%
the wardens then have a every county has
 
01:36:38.149 --> 01:36:38.159 align:start position:0%
a forest warden group and then the state
 
01:36:39.590 --> 01:36:39.600 align:start position:0%

president of i'm here today to quickly
 
01:36:45.109 --> 01:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
talk about opposing this bill
 
01:36:48.709 --> 01:36:48.719 align:start position:0%
in the fact that this bill is more of a
 
01:36:50.390 --> 01:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
an ounce of prevention
 
01:36:53.109 --> 01:36:53.119 align:start position:0%
is better than a pound of cure
 
01:36:56.950 --> 01:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
by having the um ability to
 
01:36:58.629 --> 01:36:58.639 align:start position:0%
write a permit
 
01:37:02.390 --> 01:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
from the municipal side of it is
 
01:37:04.709 --> 01:37:04.719 align:start position:0%
gives us that ability to educate the
 
01:37:07.910 --> 01:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
public you yourself are unsure about
 
01:37:10.070 --> 01:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
what requires a permit whether it's gas
 
01:37:11.990 --> 01:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
or wood or
 
01:37:14.310 --> 01:37:14.320 align:start position:0%
if it's a dish or if it's a chiminea or
 
01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:15.430 align:start position:0%
if it's a dish or if it's a chiminea or
whatever

01:37:15.430 --> 01:37:15.440 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:16.310 align:start position:0%
whatever
and

01:37:16.310 --> 01:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:37:18.629 --> 01:37:18.639 align:start position:0%
by us being able to write those permits
 
01:37:20.709 --> 01:37:20.719 align:start position:0%
to go to visit people to answer those
 
01:37:23.350 --> 01:37:23.360 align:start position:0%
questions it really helps
 
01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:25.750 align:start position:0%
questions it really helps
by

01:37:25.750 --> 01:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:27.430 --> 01:37:27.440 align:start position:0%
defining to them
 
01:37:29.030 --> 01:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
you're not supposed to put this on your
 
01:37:31.350 --> 01:37:31.360 align:start position:0%
deck because it will start your
 
01:37:33.669 --> 01:37:33.679 align:start position:0%
your siding on fire and burn your house
 
01:37:36.550 --> 01:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
down or put it 25 feet away from your
 
01:37:39.189 --> 01:37:39.199 align:start position:0%
house so that you have a defensible
 
01:37:41.669 --> 01:37:41.679 align:start position:0%
space against anything else
 
01:37:43.590 --> 01:37:43.600 align:start position:0%
against your house against your shed
 
01:37:47.510 --> 01:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:51.030 --> 01:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
by having the uh by keeping the fire
 
01:37:53.350 --> 01:37:53.360 align:start position:0%
permit in the campgrounds
 
01:37:55.990 --> 01:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
it also allows us to go visit those
 
01:37:58.310 --> 01:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
campgrounds once a year to make sure
 
01:38:01.109 --> 01:38:01.119 align:start position:0%
that the the pits themselves
 
01:38:03.830 --> 01:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
are they have the proper clearance that
 
01:38:06.149 --> 01:38:06.159 align:start position:0%
they're well maintained
 
01:38:08.950 --> 01:38:08.960 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's economy a good portion
 
01:38:11.830 --> 01:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
of the economy is based on recreation
 
01:38:13.350 --> 01:38:13.360 align:start position:0%
and the tourism
 
01:38:14.950 --> 01:38:14.960 align:start position:0%
and by
 
01:38:17.910 --> 01:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
making sure that safe from
 
01:38:21.189 --> 01:38:21.199 align:start position:0%
any kind of fire problem
 
01:38:23.510 --> 01:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
allows folks to want to come to new
 
01:38:26.310 --> 01:38:26.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire to to recreate
 
01:38:28.470 --> 01:38:28.480 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:38:31.189 --> 01:38:31.199 align:start position:0%
the the statement about the little
 
01:38:35.270 --> 01:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
campfire doesn't isn't any a big deal
 
01:38:37.590 --> 01:38:37.600 align:start position:0%
i can personally say i've been on the
 
01:38:39.830 --> 01:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
i've been to the western fires i've been
 
01:38:43.430 --> 01:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
to every year i go to the 400 000 acre
 
01:38:45.910 --> 01:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
the 500 000 acre i've been to the
 
01:38:47.669 --> 01:38:47.679 align:start position:0%
million acre fire
 
01:38:51.590 --> 01:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
that was caused by a by a campfire every
 
01:38:54.790 --> 01:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
fire that's giant starts small it starts
 
01:38:57.270 --> 01:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
at a spark smokey bear taught us that a
 
01:38:58.790 --> 01:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
million years ago
 
01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:00.709 align:start position:0%
million years ago
and

01:39:00.709 --> 01:39:00.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:39:02.950 --> 01:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
it's something that just doesn't
 
01:39:06.629 --> 01:39:06.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:09.350 --> 01:39:09.360 align:start position:0%
there is a cost to this to the local
 
01:39:13.430 --> 01:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:15.430 --> 01:39:15.440 align:start position:0%
depending on how your local fire
 
01:39:17.990 --> 01:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
department pays their folks or or
 
01:39:20.950 --> 01:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
compensates their folks
 
01:39:23.270 --> 01:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
if the tone goes some everybody has a
 
01:39:24.870 --> 01:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
cell phone now
 
01:39:26.950 --> 01:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
it used to be if you saw a fire or smoke
 
01:39:28.470 --> 01:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
you went someplace you went to the fire
 
01:39:30.790 --> 01:39:30.800 align:start position:0%
department now it's
 
01:39:33.350 --> 01:39:33.360 align:start position:0%
i was driving by and smelled smoke at
 
01:39:34.870 --> 01:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
such and such a place
 
01:39:37.189 --> 01:39:37.199 align:start position:0%
if i have gone there already
 
01:39:39.430 --> 01:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
to inspect their ugly oh i know they
 
01:39:41.830 --> 01:39:41.840 align:start position:0%
have a campfire there the seasonal
 
01:39:44.310 --> 01:39:44.320 align:start position:0%
permit not a big deal but i'll go check
 
01:39:47.109 --> 01:39:47.119 align:start position:0%
it out anyways if i don't know that
 
01:39:49.030 --> 01:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
i'm rolling out three pieces of
 
01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:50.470 align:start position:0%
i'm rolling out three pieces of
apparatus

01:39:50.470 --> 01:39:50.480 align:start position:0%
apparatus
 
01:39:52.550 --> 01:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
before i even roll out those three
 
01:39:54.470 --> 01:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
pieces of apparatus
 
01:39:56.790 --> 01:39:56.800 align:start position:0%
i have to get my volunteer departments
 
01:39:58.709 --> 01:39:58.719 align:start position:0%
to the station
 
01:40:00.470 --> 01:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
i then have to roll out that piece of
 
01:40:04.149 --> 01:40:04.159 align:start position:0%
apparatus i now have to send these down
 
01:40:04.159 --> 01:40:05.030 align:start position:0%
apparatus i now have to send these down
and

01:40:05.030 --> 01:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:40:07.030 --> 01:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
when's the last time a fire truck came
 
01:40:08.950 --> 01:40:08.960 align:start position:0%
up behind you
 
01:40:11.510 --> 01:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
did you properly pull over to the right
 
01:40:14.629 --> 01:40:14.639 align:start position:0%
of the road and stop and let them go by
 
01:40:16.629 --> 01:40:16.639 align:start position:0%
or did you stop in the middle of the
 
01:40:16.639 --> 01:40:17.669 align:start position:0%
or did you stop in the middle of the
road

01:40:17.669 --> 01:40:17.679 align:start position:0%
road
 
01:40:20.470 --> 01:40:20.480 align:start position:0%
or did you turn you know just do
 
01:40:23.270 --> 01:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
something absolutely insane
 
01:40:25.189 --> 01:40:25.199 align:start position:0%
these are the things that happen when
 
01:40:27.510 --> 01:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
when people see fire trucks
 
01:40:29.350 --> 01:40:29.360 align:start position:0%
the less time i have to have a fire
 
01:40:31.830 --> 01:40:31.840 align:start position:0%
truck on the road the less time i have
 
01:40:34.229 --> 01:40:34.239 align:start position:0%
to worry about any kind of damage to
 
01:40:36.550 --> 01:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
that piece of apparatus therefore
 
01:40:38.950 --> 01:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
another cost to the town
 
01:40:38.960 --> 01:40:39.910 align:start position:0%
another cost to the town
so

01:40:39.910 --> 01:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:40:42.790 --> 01:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
it's it's not a it's not
 
01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:43.830 align:start position:0%
it's it's not a it's not
a

01:40:43.830 --> 01:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:40:46.550 --> 01:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
no cost to the town issue there is a
 
01:40:49.350 --> 01:40:49.360 align:start position:0%
cost to the town issue but the cost is
 
01:40:53.990 --> 01:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
so minute if you ask for a free permit
 
01:40:56.470 --> 01:40:56.480 align:start position:0%
we come in we do a little education
 
01:40:58.390 --> 01:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
we move on we answer your questions
 
01:41:00.550 --> 01:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
about everything else because it might
 
01:41:02.629 --> 01:41:02.639 align:start position:0%
be the one time of year
 
01:41:04.070 --> 01:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
that you actually get to talk to
 
01:41:05.510 --> 01:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
somebody from the fire department and
 
01:41:07.270 --> 01:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
ask them that question has been burning
 
01:41:08.629 --> 01:41:08.639 align:start position:0%
for six months
 
01:41:08.639 --> 01:41:10.229 align:start position:0%
for six months
so

01:41:10.229 --> 01:41:10.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:41:13.350 --> 01:41:13.360 align:start position:0%
is this is this bill free no is this
 
01:41:14.790 --> 01:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
built should this
 
01:41:16.950 --> 01:41:16.960 align:start position:0%
be repealed
 
01:41:19.430 --> 01:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
this this should die this is not
 
01:41:21.510 --> 01:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
something that should be passed
 
01:41:22.709 --> 01:41:22.719 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:41:27.430 --> 01:41:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:28.870 --> 01:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
any questions by members of the
 
01:41:31.669 --> 01:41:31.679 align:start position:0%
committee representative creighton
 
01:41:33.109 --> 01:41:33.119 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman chief thank you
 
01:41:35.830 --> 01:41:35.840 align:start position:0%
for your testimony i i'm
 
01:41:37.350 --> 01:41:37.360 align:start position:0%
having a little problem connecting
 
01:41:37.360 --> 01:41:39.590 align:start position:0%
having a little problem connecting
though

01:41:39.590 --> 01:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
though
 
01:41:41.830 --> 01:41:41.840 align:start position:0%
if if we repeal this and you don't have
 
01:41:44.950 --> 01:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
to get a permit okay does that mean then
 
01:41:48.709 --> 01:41:48.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:49.990 --> 01:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
because that's what you just said i'm
 
01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:50.870 align:start position:0%
because that's what you just said i'm
gonna

01:41:50.870 --> 01:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
gonna
 
01:41:52.390 --> 01:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
so it's it's
 
01:41:55.030 --> 01:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
if if you take this away
 
01:41:55.040 --> 01:41:55.830 align:start position:0%
if if you take this away
i

01:41:55.830 --> 01:41:55.840 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:41:58.310 --> 01:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
i don't need to inspect that campground
 
01:42:02.310 --> 01:42:02.320 align:start position:0%
but you can but i can but it but it it
 
01:42:05.910 --> 01:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:08.550 --> 01:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
i don't want to say that the government
 
01:42:11.270 --> 01:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
the the concern of the of the author of
 
01:42:13.270 --> 01:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
this bill is that the government is
 
01:42:16.390 --> 01:42:16.400 align:start position:0%
going to come and tell me what to do
 
01:42:19.910 --> 01:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
it really is more of of an education
 
01:42:23.270 --> 01:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
and making sure that we're on the same
 
01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:24.629 align:start position:0%
and making sure that we're on the same
page

01:42:24.629 --> 01:42:24.639 align:start position:0%
page
 
01:42:26.870 --> 01:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
that yes i can come and inspect you
 
01:42:28.870 --> 01:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
because i have other laws and rules that
 
01:42:32.070 --> 01:42:32.080 align:start position:0%
allow me to do that as the fire chief
 
01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:33.270 align:start position:0%
allow me to do that as the fire chief
but

01:42:33.270 --> 01:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:42:36.550 --> 01:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
as the campground owner or the home
 
01:42:39.189 --> 01:42:39.199 align:start position:0%
owner am i going to do that no not
 
01:42:39.199 --> 01:42:40.830 align:start position:0%
owner am i going to do that no not
necessarily

01:42:40.830 --> 01:42:40.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
01:42:44.229 --> 01:42:44.239 align:start position:0%
but i go back to my statement about
 
01:42:45.830 --> 01:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
everybody has a cell phone when they
 
01:42:47.830 --> 01:42:47.840 align:start position:0%
drive by and say i smelled smoke at the
 
01:42:49.430 --> 01:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
corner of of
 
01:42:51.350 --> 01:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
elm and main street
 
01:42:53.350 --> 01:42:53.360 align:start position:0%
well where are you now i'm
 
01:42:55.350 --> 01:42:55.360 align:start position:0%
five miles away
 
01:42:58.390 --> 01:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
was it a campfire or was it a bonfire
 
01:42:59.830 --> 01:42:59.840 align:start position:0%
well i don't know
 
01:43:02.310 --> 01:43:02.320 align:start position:0%
so now as a local fire department i'm
 
01:43:05.750 --> 01:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
now rolling out apparatus and personnel
 
01:43:07.510 --> 01:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
to something that really
 
01:43:10.629 --> 01:43:10.639 align:start position:0%
could have been taken care of by a quick
 
01:43:13.830 --> 01:43:13.840 align:start position:0%
hey you got a campsite there
 
01:43:15.830 --> 01:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up
 
01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:17.750 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up
um

01:43:17.750 --> 01:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:19.830 --> 01:43:19.840 align:start position:0%

01:43:21.520 --> 01:43:22.550 align:start position:0%
our fire chief in the interim is a great
guy

01:43:22.550 --> 01:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
guy
 
01:43:24.709 --> 01:43:24.719 align:start position:0%
i'm one of that 30 percent that has had
 
01:43:26.950 --> 01:43:26.960 align:start position:0%
a permit for the last seven years
 
01:43:29.910 --> 01:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
uh he's never been to my house and
 
01:43:31.990 --> 01:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
and i talked to him on a regular basis i
 
01:43:33.830 --> 01:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
don't think he goes to anyone's house
 
01:43:36.790 --> 01:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:38.629 --> 01:43:38.639 align:start position:0%

request
 
01:45:12.229 --> 01:45:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:15.750 --> 01:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
brought up because people who live on
 
01:45:17.910 --> 01:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
lakes and
 
01:45:20.550 --> 01:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
rivers and shorelines and even tidal
 
01:45:20.560 --> 01:45:21.750 align:start position:0%
rivers and shorelines and even tidal
waters

01:45:21.750 --> 01:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
waters
 
01:45:24.870 --> 01:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
when they have damage to their property
 
01:45:28.229 --> 01:45:28.239 align:start position:0%
they've found it very onerous to
 
01:45:30.709 --> 01:45:30.719 align:start position:0%
be able to go through the permitting
 
01:45:30.719 --> 01:45:31.830 align:start position:0%
be able to go through the permitting
process

01:45:31.830 --> 01:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:45:33.430 --> 01:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
to be able to
 
01:45:33.440 --> 01:45:34.629 align:start position:0%
to be able to
um

01:45:34.629 --> 01:45:34.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:39.590 --> 01:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
fix the their erosion problems um from
 
01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:40.950 align:start position:0%
fix the their erosion problems um from
uh

01:45:40.950 --> 01:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:45:42.550 --> 01:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
boats when
 
01:45:45.990 --> 01:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
there's ex excessive um speeding and the
 
01:45:47.750 --> 01:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
waves come in and
 
01:45:47.760 --> 01:45:48.790 align:start position:0%
waves come in and
um

01:45:48.790 --> 01:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:53.030 --> 01:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
and and other issues that happen uh
 
01:45:55.430 --> 01:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
because of you know natural
 
01:45:57.270 --> 01:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
conditions winds and things like that
 
01:45:59.750 --> 01:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
that damage their shoreline
 
01:46:01.350 --> 01:46:01.360 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:46:03.189 --> 01:46:03.199 align:start position:0%
and many people told
 
01:46:05.270 --> 01:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
me that they had difficulties filling
 
01:46:07.750 --> 01:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
out the forms and they had to go to
 
01:46:10.870 --> 01:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
lawyers and it was very expensive there
 
01:46:12.709 --> 01:46:12.719 align:start position:0%
were was
 
01:46:15.590 --> 01:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
excessive time
 
01:46:19.350 --> 01:46:19.360 align:start position:0%
in in getting this done
 
01:46:19.360 --> 01:46:24.550 align:start position:0%
in in getting this done
and

01:46:24.550 --> 01:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:27.430 --> 01:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
because of folks not being able to
 
01:46:29.830 --> 01:46:29.840 align:start position:0%
either afford to get a lawyer to do this
 
01:46:32.390 --> 01:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
or have been denied or have not heard
 
01:46:32.400 --> 01:46:33.990 align:start position:0%
or have been denied or have not heard
back

01:46:33.990 --> 01:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
back
 
01:46:35.510 --> 01:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
from the
 
01:46:35.520 --> 01:46:36.709 align:start position:0%
from the
des

01:46:36.709 --> 01:46:36.719 align:start position:0%
des
 
01:46:38.870 --> 01:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
on permitting
 
01:46:42.149 --> 01:46:42.159 align:start position:0%
they have often done things um what they
 
01:46:42.159 --> 01:46:43.910 align:start position:0%
they have often done things um what they
call

01:46:43.910 --> 01:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
call
 
01:46:45.669 --> 01:46:45.679 align:start position:0%
midnight gardening and
 
01:46:46.629 --> 01:46:46.639 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:46:49.270 --> 01:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
what will happen is a neighbor or
 
01:46:51.510 --> 01:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
someone sees that something's changed
 
01:46:53.189 --> 01:46:53.199 align:start position:0%
and they'll report it and these folks
 
01:46:54.390 --> 01:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
can get fined
 
01:46:56.950 --> 01:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
so in order for people to do things
 
01:46:59.590 --> 01:46:59.600 align:start position:0%
legally appropriately
 
01:47:01.990 --> 01:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
we were putting this bill in place so
 
01:47:04.310 --> 01:47:04.320 align:start position:0%
that it would simplify the process make
 
01:47:06.390 --> 01:47:06.400 align:start position:0%
it easier you wouldn't need to go to a
 
01:47:08.629 --> 01:47:08.639 align:start position:0%
lawyer to to be able to fill out these
 
01:47:08.639 --> 01:47:09.990 align:start position:0%
lawyer to to be able to fill out these
forms

01:47:09.990 --> 01:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
forms
 
01:47:14.629 --> 01:47:14.639 align:start position:0%
and so in this process for this bill um
 
01:47:16.709 --> 01:47:16.719 align:start position:0%
i worked uh
 
01:47:18.790 --> 01:47:18.800 align:start position:0%
with the des
 
01:47:21.990 --> 01:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
and they have assured me
 
01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.229 align:start position:0%
and they have assured me
that

01:47:24.229 --> 01:47:24.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:47:25.990 --> 01:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
because these are
 
01:47:29.510 --> 01:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
the rules they they get to put forth
 
01:47:29.520 --> 01:47:30.390 align:start position:0%
the rules they they get to put forth
that

01:47:30.390 --> 01:47:30.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:47:33.910 --> 01:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
they will be going back to a simplified
 
01:47:33.920 --> 01:47:35.189 align:start position:0%
they will be going back to a simplified
version

01:47:35.189 --> 01:47:35.199 align:start position:0%
version
 
01:47:38.790 --> 01:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
and it will be more consumer-friendly
 
01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:40.149 align:start position:0%
and it will be more consumer-friendly
and

01:47:40.149 --> 01:47:40.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:47:42.470 --> 01:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
there's time limitations and prior to
 
01:47:44.950 --> 01:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
this they had not provided actual
 
01:47:44.960 --> 01:47:46.709 align:start position:0%
this they had not provided actual
permits

01:47:46.709 --> 01:47:46.719 align:start position:0%
permits
 
01:47:48.830 --> 01:47:48.840 align:start position:0%
now they will be
 
01:47:48.840 --> 01:47:50.390 align:start position:0%
now they will be
um

01:47:50.390 --> 01:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:53.990 --> 01:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
providing the homeowners a a an actual
 
01:47:57.030 --> 01:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
physical permit and if it is denied
 
01:47:59.590 --> 01:47:59.600 align:start position:0%
there is an opportunity for
 
01:48:02.950 --> 01:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
them to come in either prior to making
 
01:48:05.750 --> 01:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
their their changes or
 
01:48:08.470 --> 01:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
their projects they can go in
 
01:48:11.750 --> 01:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
and and ask for help from the des and if
 
01:48:14.310 --> 01:48:14.320 align:start position:0%
it's after and denied there is a time
 
01:48:16.709 --> 01:48:16.719 align:start position:0%
period where they can go in and work
 
01:48:19.189 --> 01:48:19.199 align:start position:0%
with them again to to see what can be
 
01:48:22.149 --> 01:48:22.159 align:start position:0%
done and they will get a denial
 
01:48:26.470 --> 01:48:26.480 align:start position:0%
um so at this point i feel that we don't
 
01:48:28.950 --> 01:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
need to have this bill
 
01:48:33.910 --> 01:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
and um so i'm in support of um
 
01:48:38.550 --> 01:48:38.560 align:start position:0%
either itling it or laying it on a table
 
01:48:40.870 --> 01:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
what they have assured me is that
 
01:48:44.070 --> 01:48:44.080 align:start position:0%
these changes will be made
 
01:48:46.470 --> 01:48:46.480 align:start position:0%
in around six to eight months which i
 
01:48:47.990 --> 01:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
think would be
 
01:48:50.149 --> 01:48:50.159 align:start position:0%
more prudent if we put this bill forth i
 
01:48:52.550 --> 01:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
think it would take much longer it would
 
01:48:54.870 --> 01:48:54.880 align:start position:0%
also one of the things they um
 
01:48:57.750 --> 01:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
they spoke to me about is by opening
 
01:49:00.390 --> 01:49:00.400 align:start position:0%
this up it could create
 
01:49:03.430 --> 01:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
other statutes to be affected and it
 
01:49:04.470 --> 01:49:04.480 align:start position:0%
might take
 
01:49:07.750 --> 01:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
longer for this to get approved so
 
01:49:08.709 --> 01:49:08.719 align:start position:0%
i would
 
01:49:12.390 --> 01:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
ask for your support in either
 
01:49:15.189 --> 01:49:15.199 align:start position:0%
itling or laying it on the table in case
 
01:49:21.109 --> 01:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:23.430 --> 01:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
first of all
 
01:49:25.669 --> 01:49:25.679 align:start position:0%
for uh there is no such thing as laying
 
01:49:28.870 --> 01:49:28.880 align:start position:0%
it on a table in in committee
 
01:49:30.870 --> 01:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
thank you could probably
 
01:49:32.870 --> 01:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
we can discuss right now we're in the
 
01:49:34.070 --> 01:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
middle of
 
01:49:35.510 --> 01:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
it is in a hearing
 
01:49:35.520 --> 01:49:36.629 align:start position:0%
it is in a hearing
hearing

01:49:36.629 --> 01:49:36.639 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:49:38.310 --> 01:49:38.320 align:start position:0%
uh we
 
01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:39.189 align:start position:0%
uh we
uh

01:49:39.189 --> 01:49:39.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:49:41.270 --> 01:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
but also we're
 
01:49:44.390 --> 01:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
have people here to testify i think we
 
01:49:44.400 --> 01:49:46.070 align:start position:0%
have people here to testify i think we
should

01:49:46.070 --> 01:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
should
 
01:49:47.990 --> 01:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
allow them to
 
01:49:49.589 --> 01:49:49.599 align:start position:0%
to speak as well
 
01:49:50.870 --> 01:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:49:50.880 --> 01:49:53.350 align:start position:0%
and then
after

01:49:53.350 --> 01:49:53.360 align:start position:0%
after
 
01:49:55.350 --> 01:49:55.360 align:start position:0%
there's also a few questions that might
 
01:49:56.950 --> 01:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
be asked but
 
01:49:58.470 --> 01:49:58.480 align:start position:0%
i'll say that
 
01:50:01.030 --> 01:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
we can discuss what we what might be
 
01:50:02.070 --> 01:50:02.080 align:start position:0%
done well
 
01:50:05.120 --> 01:50:05.130 align:start position:0%
we'll do it in in open session
 
01:50:05.130 --> 01:50:06.470 align:start position:0%
we'll do it in in open session
[Music]

01:50:06.470 --> 01:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:50:09.030 --> 01:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
but representative cohen you had a
 
01:50:11.109 --> 01:50:11.119 align:start position:0%
question representative post thank you
 
01:50:12.950 --> 01:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
01:50:12.960 --> 01:50:13.910 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
um

01:50:13.910 --> 01:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:15.910 --> 01:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
i just have a quick question about you i
 
01:50:17.990 --> 01:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
respect your recommendation
 
01:50:19.750 --> 01:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
uh on what you want to do with this bill
 
01:50:21.990 --> 01:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
because there are other reps on this
 
01:50:24.070 --> 01:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
bill that can't testify because they
 
01:50:25.669 --> 01:50:25.679 align:start position:0%
can't answer questions because they're
 
01:50:28.550 --> 01:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
sitting out here i'm just curious from
 
01:50:30.550 --> 01:50:30.560 align:start position:0%
your personal experience do you think
 
01:50:33.109 --> 01:50:33.119 align:start position:0%
that these other reps on co-sponsor the
 
01:50:34.629 --> 01:50:34.639 align:start position:0%
bill will go along with your
 
01:50:38.550 --> 01:50:38.560 align:start position:0%
recommendation as well
 
01:50:40.629 --> 01:50:40.639 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um
 
01:50:42.629 --> 01:50:42.639 align:start position:0%
i did send out an email but it was quite
 
01:50:45.430 --> 01:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
late i just met with the des yesterday
 
01:50:47.910 --> 01:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
um because i was aware that
 
01:50:50.229 --> 01:50:50.239 align:start position:0%
there might be an amendment needed to do
 
01:50:52.629 --> 01:50:52.639 align:start position:0%
this and in our discussion
 
01:50:55.990 --> 01:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
we talked about this bill and realized
 
01:51:01.030 --> 01:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:03.109 --> 01:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
letting the des handle it within their
 
01:51:05.430 --> 01:51:05.440 align:start position:0%
rules to simplify it
 
01:51:07.350 --> 01:51:07.360 align:start position:0%
so i have not heard from any of the
 
01:51:10.870 --> 01:51:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:13.430 --> 01:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to hear from them and
 
01:51:16.310 --> 01:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
if they're in support of continuing it i
 
01:51:16.320 --> 01:51:17.270 align:start position:0%
if they're in support of continuing it i
would

01:51:17.270 --> 01:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:51:20.310 --> 01:51:20.320 align:start position:0%
agree with that as well but
 
01:51:23.189 --> 01:51:23.199 align:start position:0%
i do feel that we have an opportunity to
 
01:51:25.350 --> 01:51:25.360 align:start position:0%
work with them and
 
01:51:26.629 --> 01:51:26.639 align:start position:0%
get this done
 
01:51:37.030 --> 01:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:39.750 --> 01:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:39.760 --> 01:51:40.709 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:51:40.709 --> 01:51:40.719 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:51:40.719 --> 01:51:41.589 align:start position:0%
uh
there's

01:51:41.589 --> 01:51:41.599 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:51:45.109 --> 01:51:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:47.350 --> 01:51:47.360 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors are
 
01:51:49.030 --> 01:51:49.040 align:start position:0%

01:51:51.830 --> 01:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
cannot speak you just have to
 
01:51:52.550 --> 01:51:52.560 align:start position:0%
but i would
 
01:51:52.560 --> 01:51:54.870 align:start position:0%
but i would

you say and
 
01:52:03.760 --> 01:52:04.709 align:start position:0%

representative

01:54:23.270 --> 01:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:54:23.280 --> 01:54:24.709 align:start position:0%
representative
representative

01:54:24.709 --> 01:54:24.719 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:54:27.350 --> 01:54:27.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman could you explain
 
01:54:30.149 --> 01:54:30.159 align:start position:0%
um what is being done or or what you
 
01:54:32.629 --> 01:54:32.639 align:start position:0%
folks are
 
01:54:34.310 --> 01:54:34.320 align:start position:0%
trying to do
 
01:54:36.629 --> 01:54:36.639 align:start position:0%
in in lieu of of what this would be
 
01:54:40.390 --> 01:54:40.400 align:start position:0%
having you uh or or asking you to do
 
01:54:42.229 --> 01:54:42.239 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
01:54:44.550 --> 01:54:44.560 align:start position:0%
the bill is currently written would
 
01:54:46.229 --> 01:54:46.239 align:start position:0%
affect rulemaking authority under
 
01:54:48.709 --> 01:54:48.719 align:start position:0%
shoreland unfortunately the processes
 
01:54:50.310 --> 01:54:50.320 align:start position:0%
that we're discussing are not under the
 
01:54:51.589 --> 01:54:51.599 align:start position:0%
shoreline protection act they're under
 
01:54:51.599 --> 01:54:52.709 align:start position:0%
shoreline protection act they're under
wetlands

01:54:52.709 --> 01:54:52.719 align:start position:0%
wetlands
 
01:54:54.790 --> 01:54:54.800 align:start position:0%
we are already in early draft stages of
 
01:54:56.470 --> 01:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
wetland rulemaking
 
01:54:56.480 --> 01:54:58.390 align:start position:0%
wetland rulemaking
to

01:54:58.390 --> 01:54:58.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:54:59.669 --> 01:54:59.679 align:start position:0%
take the
 
01:55:02.709 --> 01:55:02.719 align:start position:0%
parts of this form which are
 
01:55:04.870 --> 01:55:04.880 align:start position:0%
hardest to understand
 
01:55:06.870 --> 01:55:06.880 align:start position:0%
in that they refer people to large
 
01:55:08.390 --> 01:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
sections of rules and require the
 
01:55:10.070 --> 01:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
reading of these sections in their
 
01:55:12.229 --> 01:55:12.239 align:start position:0%
entirety instead of just picking out
 
01:55:14.310 --> 01:55:14.320 align:start position:0%
selected items we are already in the
 
01:55:17.270 --> 01:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
process of that wetland rule correction
 
01:55:19.030 --> 01:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
we hope to
 
01:55:21.109 --> 01:55:21.119 align:start position:0%
have an initial draft we hope to have
 
01:55:23.030 --> 01:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
initiated that rule-making process and
 
01:55:24.790 --> 01:55:24.800 align:start position:0%
be at the point of
 
01:55:27.189 --> 01:55:27.199 align:start position:0%
having publicly viewable versions of
 
01:55:28.790 --> 01:55:28.800 align:start position:0%
those new rules
 
01:55:30.310 --> 01:55:30.320 align:start position:0%
this summer
 
01:55:32.709 --> 01:55:32.719 align:start position:0%
so as you know the rulemaking process um
 
01:55:34.550 --> 01:55:34.560 align:start position:0%
takes a little bit of time the drafts
 
01:55:37.430 --> 01:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:39.030 --> 01:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
we should have a draft for public
 
01:55:41.109 --> 01:55:41.119 align:start position:0%
comment and viewing this summer so you
 
01:55:42.870 --> 01:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
guys can see firsthand and part of that
 
01:55:45.109 --> 01:55:45.119 align:start position:0%
will be required revised forms so you
 
01:55:47.109 --> 01:55:47.119 align:start position:0%
will see hard copies of this excellent
 
01:55:52.390 --> 01:55:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:54.550 --> 01:55:54.560 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:55:56.070 --> 01:55:56.080 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
01:56:02.870 --> 01:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:02.880 --> 01:56:04.229 align:start position:0%

i will i don't like to do that
 
01:56:38.629 --> 01:56:38.639 align:start position:0%
that's and

that's and
uh

01:56:39.830 --> 01:56:39.840 align:start position:0%

i would not do i won't do it unless i
 
01:56:53.189 --> 01:56:53.199 align:start position:0%
have agreement from everyone here
 
01:56:54.870 --> 01:56:54.880 align:start position:0%
that we
 
01:56:57.510 --> 01:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
should be to be able to
 
01:56:59.750 --> 01:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh bring this
 
01:57:02.149 --> 01:57:02.159 align:start position:0%
bill to exec this bill
 
01:57:02.159 --> 01:57:03.750 align:start position:0%
bill to exec this bill
uh

01:57:03.750 --> 01:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:57:06.070 --> 01:57:06.080 align:start position:0%
just just this bill that's all uh just
 
01:57:08.790 --> 01:57:08.800 align:start position:0%
this bill to be able to get it off the
 
01:57:11.270 --> 01:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
off the table and then it's
 
01:57:12.870 --> 01:57:12.880 align:start position:0%
it it's gone
 
01:57:12.880 --> 01:57:15.270 align:start position:0%
it it's gone
uh

01:57:15.270 --> 01:57:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:17.270 --> 01:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
i would uh
 
01:57:20.070 --> 01:57:20.080 align:start position:0%
for a discussion or representative huff
 
01:57:21.270 --> 01:57:21.280 align:start position:0%
you had a question
 
01:57:23.750 --> 01:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
um yeah i just wanted to um to say to
 
01:57:26.550 --> 01:57:26.560 align:start position:0%
the committee that um if if you were to
 
01:57:28.629 --> 01:57:28.639 align:start position:0%
choose to execute this bill i would
 
01:57:30.790 --> 01:57:30.800 align:start position:0%
consider making a motion to retain the
 
01:57:30.800 --> 01:57:31.669 align:start position:0%
consider making a motion to retain the
bill

01:57:31.669 --> 01:57:31.679 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:57:34.629 --> 01:57:34.639 align:start position:0%
that would have been my recommendation
 
01:57:36.310 --> 01:57:36.320 align:start position:0%
no not retention
 
01:57:36.320 --> 01:57:47.350 align:start position:0%
no not retention
yeah

01:57:47.350 --> 01:57:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:49.830 --> 01:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
right retain second year retain is only
 
01:57:52.790 --> 01:57:52.800 align:start position:0%
the first year yeah interim study what
 
01:57:55.430 --> 01:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
that would do we do have some interim
 
01:57:57.430 --> 01:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
study bills
 
01:57:57.440 --> 01:57:58.629 align:start position:0%
study bills
uh

01:57:58.629 --> 01:57:58.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:58:00.550 --> 01:58:00.560 align:start position:0%
left over we
 
01:58:03.510 --> 01:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
are we do have several bills
 
01:58:06.310 --> 01:58:06.320 align:start position:0%
one that comes at least one these these
 
01:58:08.629 --> 01:58:08.639 align:start position:0%
septic system ones
 
01:58:11.669 --> 01:58:11.679 align:start position:0%
so we do have to meet on that
 
01:58:13.589 --> 01:58:13.599 align:start position:0%
uh later on in the year
 
01:58:13.599 --> 01:58:15.109 align:start position:0%
uh later on in the year
so

01:58:15.109 --> 01:58:15.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:58:17.510 --> 01:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
every uh do i have agreement from the
 
01:58:19.589 --> 01:58:19.599 align:start position:0%
from the committee to
 
01:58:24.950 --> 01:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:26.870 --> 01:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
mr chair i hate to
 
01:58:29.830 --> 01:58:29.840 align:start position:0%
be opposing your suggestion but
 
01:58:31.830 --> 01:58:31.840 align:start position:0%
um i would feel more comfortable if it
 
01:58:33.750 --> 01:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
was advertised and we just put it on the
 
01:58:36.950 --> 01:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
exec list and not post it that it's
 
01:58:39.109 --> 01:58:39.119 align:start position:0%
going to be on exec list whether you
 
01:58:41.189 --> 01:58:41.199 align:start position:0%
have the authority or not i'd like to
 
01:58:43.669 --> 01:58:43.679 align:start position:0%
just stay in consistent that we're going
 
01:58:45.350 --> 01:58:45.360 align:start position:0%
to post that we're going to exact it i
 
01:58:46.390 --> 01:58:46.400 align:start position:0%
don't think we're going to take a long
 
01:58:48.070 --> 01:58:48.080 align:start position:0%
time to execute it so it won't take a
 
01:58:50.550 --> 01:58:50.560 align:start position:0%
long time when you actually put out your
 
01:58:53.669 --> 01:58:53.679 align:start position:0%
list of exact exacting so i'd like to
 
01:58:57.750 --> 01:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
just wait and do it when we post
 
01:59:00.390 --> 01:59:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:03.109 --> 01:59:03.119 align:start position:0%
yes mr chairperson i respect your
 
01:59:05.189 --> 01:59:05.199 align:start position:0%
authority and ability to call an
 
01:59:07.750 --> 01:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
executive session anytime you want so
 
01:59:11.109 --> 01:59:11.119 align:start position:0%
i'm just suggesting that informally we
 
01:59:12.870 --> 01:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
understood that there would be none
 
01:59:15.669 --> 01:59:15.679 align:start position:0%
today again i know that you can do that
 
01:59:18.229 --> 01:59:18.239 align:start position:0%
and that there are several of
 
01:59:18.239 --> 01:59:19.109 align:start position:0%
and that there are several of
my

01:59:19.109 --> 01:59:19.119 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:59:21.589 --> 01:59:21.599 align:start position:0%
peers that are not here today i mean i
 
01:59:23.830 --> 01:59:23.840 align:start position:0%
intend to support
 
01:59:26.149 --> 01:59:26.159 align:start position:0%
representative post's suggestion but i
 
01:59:28.070 --> 01:59:28.080 align:start position:0%
think we'd rather give the opportunity
 
01:59:29.910 --> 01:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
just to have more people here that
 
01:59:31.910 --> 01:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
thought there might not be an executive
 
01:59:34.149 --> 01:59:34.159 align:start position:0%
session again i respect that you can
 
01:59:35.589 --> 01:59:35.599 align:start position:0%
call at any time and it's your
 
01:59:35.599 --> 02:21:49.190 align:start position:0%
call at any time and it's your
discretion

02:21:49.190 --> 02:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:52.830 --> 02:21:52.840 align:start position:0%
gonna open up house bill 1620
 
02:21:56.469 --> 02:21:56.479 align:start position:0%
identifying part of the merrimack river
 
02:21:56.479 --> 02:21:57.910 align:start position:0%
identifying part of the merrimack river
as

02:21:57.910 --> 02:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
as
 
02:22:01.030 --> 02:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
prote as a protected river
 
02:22:03.190 --> 02:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
recognized uh
 
02:22:06.630 --> 02:22:06.640 align:start position:0%
representative russell russ berry
 
02:22:08.550 --> 02:22:08.560 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the committee um my
 
02:22:10.870 --> 02:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
name is uh ross berry i'm representative
 
02:22:13.030 --> 02:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
from the city of manchester on the south
 
02:22:14.630 --> 02:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
side and the town
 
02:22:16.070 --> 02:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
of litchfield
 
02:22:17.910 --> 02:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
litchfield those you don't know is on
 
02:22:20.150 --> 02:22:20.160 align:start position:0%
the other side of the town of merrimack
 
02:22:21.750 --> 02:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
and was just as affected by water
 
02:22:23.670 --> 02:22:23.680 align:start position:0%
quality issues
 
02:22:26.550 --> 02:22:26.560 align:start position:0%
so water quality issues are a
 
02:22:28.309 --> 02:22:28.319 align:start position:0%
it's an extensive concern for the people
 
02:22:29.910 --> 02:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
that i represent the one thing that
 
02:22:31.910 --> 02:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
binds my two communities together
 
02:22:32.950 --> 02:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
outside of those who commute from
 
02:22:34.469 --> 02:22:34.479 align:start position:0%
manchester from litchfield to manchester
 
02:22:37.190 --> 02:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
is the merrimack river itself
 
02:22:39.429 --> 02:22:39.439 align:start position:0%
so the state established
 
02:22:41.590 --> 02:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
this program that allows for the
 
02:22:43.750 --> 02:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
designation of status
 
02:22:46.790 --> 02:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
of the river of rivers for protection
 
02:22:48.230 --> 02:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
and there's varying different degrees of
 
02:22:50.710 --> 02:22:50.720 align:start position:0%
protection that the state allows
 
02:22:52.870 --> 02:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
a rural river a natural river
 
02:22:54.550 --> 02:22:54.560 align:start position:0%
and a community river
 
02:22:56.150 --> 02:22:56.160 align:start position:0%
and each of those designations has
 
02:22:58.870 --> 02:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
different levels of protection mostly
 
02:22:58.880 --> 02:23:00.389 align:start position:0%
different levels of protection mostly
surrounding

02:23:00.389 --> 02:23:00.399 align:start position:0%
surrounding
 
02:23:02.469 --> 02:23:02.479 align:start position:0%
wastewater issues
 
02:23:04.950 --> 02:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
fertilizer use and and um some things to
 
02:23:07.349 --> 02:23:07.359 align:start position:0%
do with motorized vehicles
 
02:23:10.550 --> 02:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
so what i am attempting to do is add in
 
02:23:12.550 --> 02:23:12.560 align:start position:0%
the section of the merrimack river that
 
02:23:15.750 --> 02:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
runs through the city um and hooks it
 
02:23:18.469 --> 02:23:18.479 align:start position:0%
down to the state line the community
 
02:23:20.469 --> 02:23:20.479 align:start position:0%
designate the community designation for
 
02:23:22.630 --> 02:23:22.640 align:start position:0%
the river already exists starting in the
 
02:23:25.030 --> 02:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
town of merrimack
 
02:23:27.030 --> 02:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
the only section of the merrimack river
 
02:23:27.040 --> 02:23:27.830 align:start position:0%
the only section of the merrimack river
of

02:23:27.830 --> 02:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:23:29.270 --> 02:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
i don't want to say significance but
 
02:23:31.270 --> 02:23:31.280 align:start position:0%
let's say significant population portion
 
02:23:33.349 --> 02:23:33.359 align:start position:0%
that isn't covered by this program is
 
02:23:34.790 --> 02:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
actually the section that runs through
 
02:23:38.469 --> 02:23:38.479 align:start position:0%
manchester um manchester is known for
 
02:23:40.870 --> 02:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
let's say our abuse of the river as a
 
02:23:42.870 --> 02:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
whole i read a study once it said nearly
 
02:23:44.870 --> 02:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
half of the pollution that comes into
 
02:23:47.110 --> 02:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
the merrimack river comes from my city
 
02:23:50.230 --> 02:23:50.240 align:start position:0%
due to our sewage issues
 
02:23:52.950 --> 02:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
and we do have a consent decree that was
 
02:23:54.389 --> 02:23:54.399 align:start position:0%
signed with the environmental protection
 
02:23:57.030 --> 02:23:57.040 align:start position:0%
agency i believe i want to say a little
 
02:23:58.389 --> 02:23:58.399 align:start position:0%
over a year ago
 
02:24:00.710 --> 02:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
to resolve that issue and i did put in a
 
02:24:03.510 --> 02:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
clause in the bill that would prohibit
 
02:24:05.990 --> 02:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
this protection status from interfering
 
02:24:07.830 --> 02:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
with that consent decree i figure if
 
02:24:09.349 --> 02:24:09.359 align:start position:0%
it's good enough for the epa it's
 
02:24:12.870 --> 02:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
probably good enough uh for the um
 
02:24:14.950 --> 02:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
it is probably good enough for this act
 
02:24:15.830 --> 02:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
which is
 
02:24:17.830 --> 02:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
much more um
 
02:24:20.630 --> 02:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
uh narrower um so a couple of statements
 
02:24:22.469 --> 02:24:22.479 align:start position:0%
i'd like to read full disclosure this is
 
02:24:24.630 --> 02:24:24.640 align:start position:0%
not an area of expertise of mind i mean
 
02:24:26.389 --> 02:24:26.399 align:start position:0%
this is a constituent concern but it is
 
02:24:28.230 --> 02:24:28.240 align:start position:0%
not i do not pretend to be as
 
02:24:29.670 --> 02:24:29.680 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable about this as the people
 
02:24:31.670 --> 02:24:31.680 align:start position:0%
behind me um or the committee members
 
02:24:31.680 --> 02:24:32.790 align:start position:0%
behind me um or the committee members
themselves

02:24:32.790 --> 02:24:32.800 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
02:24:34.469 --> 02:24:34.479 align:start position:0%
but the res the river designation as a
 
02:24:35.910 --> 02:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
community established increases public
 
02:24:37.510 --> 02:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
awareness of the river and creates a
 
02:24:39.270 --> 02:24:39.280 align:start position:0%
local community planning and management
 
02:24:40.550 --> 02:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
efforts centered specifically on the
 
02:24:42.790 --> 02:24:42.800 align:start position:0%
river and its resources this local
 
02:24:42.800 --> 02:24:44.630 align:start position:0%
river and its resources this local
community

02:24:44.630 --> 02:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
community
 
02:24:46.389 --> 02:24:46.399 align:start position:0%
group basically already exists we're
 
02:24:49.270 --> 02:24:49.280 align:start position:0%
just tacking it into the existing one
 
02:24:51.190 --> 02:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
because once again the community river
 
02:24:53.429 --> 02:24:53.439 align:start position:0%
designation already exists immediately
 
02:24:56.870 --> 02:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
south of the manchester line
 
02:24:58.630 --> 02:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
by law the only land use protection
 
02:24:59.670 --> 02:24:59.680 align:start position:0%
measures that are added with the
 
02:25:01.429 --> 02:25:01.439 align:start position:0%
community designation are those for
 
02:25:04.309 --> 02:25:04.319 align:start position:0%
solid and hazardous waste facilities and
 
02:25:06.230 --> 02:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
uh and first second and third order
 
02:25:06.240 --> 02:25:07.270 align:start position:0%
uh and first second and third order
streams

02:25:07.270 --> 02:25:07.280 align:start position:0%
streams
 
02:25:08.630 --> 02:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
and those described in the shoreline
 
02:25:10.469 --> 02:25:10.479 align:start position:0%
water protection act so this doesn't
 
02:25:13.990 --> 02:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
affect any existing landfill or
 
02:25:15.750 --> 02:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
wastewater facility
 
02:25:17.429 --> 02:25:17.439 align:start position:0%
they can still expand they can still
 
02:25:19.510 --> 02:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
operate but they cannot build a new one
 
02:25:22.710 --> 02:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
within 250 feet of the shoreline
 
02:25:23.910 --> 02:25:23.920 align:start position:0%
so for those of you who are not familiar
 
02:25:25.510 --> 02:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
with manchester i don't know where you
 
02:25:26.710 --> 02:25:26.720 align:start position:0%
would build
 
02:25:29.510 --> 02:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
a wastewater facility or landfill within
 
02:25:32.150 --> 02:25:32.160 align:start position:0%
250 feet of our shoreline but this would
 
02:25:34.950 --> 02:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
be that would be the major prohibition
 
02:25:38.150 --> 02:25:38.160 align:start position:0%
on the use of this river um river
 
02:25:40.150 --> 02:25:40.160 align:start position:0%
designations can increase property can
 
02:25:41.990 --> 02:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
respect can increase respect for
 
02:25:43.590 --> 02:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
property rights and heightened
 
02:25:45.349 --> 02:25:45.359 align:start position:0%
heightened recognition of the valuable
 
02:25:47.190 --> 02:25:47.200 align:start position:0%
contribution which land owners already
 
02:25:49.670 --> 02:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
make in river protection issues such as
 
02:25:51.910 --> 02:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
trespassing liability and erosion effect
 
02:25:54.389 --> 02:25:54.399 align:start position:0%
or infringe upon the rights of river of
 
02:25:56.550 --> 02:25:56.560 align:start position:0%
river land owners
 
02:25:58.309 --> 02:25:58.319 align:start position:0%
community rivers or segment flows
 
02:26:00.630 --> 02:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
through developed or populated areas
 
02:26:00.640 --> 02:26:01.670 align:start position:0%
through developed or populated areas
uh

02:26:01.670 --> 02:26:01.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:26:03.670 --> 02:26:03.680 align:start position:0%
are readily accessible by this is the
 
02:26:04.870 --> 02:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
this is the designation of the community
 
02:26:06.710 --> 02:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
river excuse me
 
02:26:07.830 --> 02:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
they are
 
02:26:09.030 --> 02:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
they're segments that flow through
 
02:26:11.590 --> 02:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
developed or populated areas manchester
 
02:26:13.510 --> 02:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
um and are readily accessible by road or
 
02:26:13.520 --> 02:26:14.550 align:start position:0%
um and are readily accessible by road or
railroad

02:26:14.550 --> 02:26:14.560 align:start position:0%
railroad
 
02:26:17.190 --> 02:26:17.200 align:start position:0%
manchester um these rivers may include
 
02:26:19.190 --> 02:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
existing or potential empowerments or
 
02:26:21.270 --> 02:26:21.280 align:start position:0%
diversions for hydropower flood control
 
02:26:23.670 --> 02:26:23.680 align:start position:0%
or water supply as well as urban centers
 
02:26:25.590 --> 02:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
manchester that could qualify for
 
02:26:27.750 --> 02:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
shoreline water quality protection act
 
02:26:29.670 --> 02:26:29.680 align:start position:0%
urban exemptions so basically the
 
02:26:31.750 --> 02:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
community river designation is for
 
02:26:33.990 --> 02:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
places like manchester for places like
 
02:26:36.790 --> 02:26:36.800 align:start position:0%
merrimack it's or places like nashua
 
02:26:39.590 --> 02:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
i don't know why they didn't include
 
02:26:41.510 --> 02:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
this section of the river or
 
02:26:43.990 --> 02:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
initially in this my only gut and i am
 
02:26:46.150 --> 02:26:46.160 align:start position:0%
speculating here is that because of our
 
02:26:48.469 --> 02:26:48.479 align:start position:0%
known sewage issues in manchester they
 
02:26:50.630 --> 02:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't have qualified so when
 
02:26:52.630 --> 02:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
it rains really heavily in manchester
 
02:26:55.910 --> 02:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
this is the consent decree with the epa
 
02:26:58.550 --> 02:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
we do not handle the overflow
 
02:27:00.870 --> 02:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
we shamefully dump that overflow into
 
02:27:02.950 --> 02:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
the merrimack once again half of the
 
02:27:04.469 --> 02:27:04.479 align:start position:0%
pollution from the merrimack comes from
 
02:27:07.429 --> 02:27:07.439 align:start position:0%
manchester once again epa consent decree
 
02:27:10.309 --> 02:27:10.319 align:start position:0%
we are fixing that um but now that that
 
02:27:12.790 --> 02:27:12.800 align:start position:0%
issue is being resolved this will kind
 
02:27:15.030 --> 02:27:15.040 align:start position:0%
of shore up so those things can't happen
 
02:27:17.349 --> 02:27:17.359 align:start position:0%
again because it is not good to pollute
 
02:27:20.389 --> 02:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
the rivers so with that i will and one
 
02:27:22.150 --> 02:27:22.160 align:start position:0%
other thing
 
02:27:24.230 --> 02:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
the community river designation program
 
02:27:25.670 --> 02:27:25.680 align:start position:0%
has a
 
02:27:29.190 --> 02:27:29.200 align:start position:0%
process an rsa by which they
 
02:27:31.990 --> 02:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
they want you to follow
 
02:27:33.750 --> 02:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
it's community input
 
02:27:35.349 --> 02:27:35.359 align:start position:0%
those sort of deals
 
02:27:36.550 --> 02:27:36.560 align:start position:0%
i understand that there's been some
 
02:27:38.230 --> 02:27:38.240 align:start position:0%
issues with some people that with some
 
02:27:39.750 --> 02:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
organizations that
 
02:27:41.429 --> 02:27:41.439 align:start position:0%
are associated that are interested in
 
02:27:43.030 --> 02:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
this who support the concept but don't
 
02:27:44.550 --> 02:27:44.560 align:start position:0%
support the way about which we're doing
 
02:27:44.560 --> 02:27:45.510 align:start position:0%
support the way about which we're doing
it

02:27:45.510 --> 02:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:27:47.429 --> 02:27:47.439 align:start position:0%
i'll tell you right now as legislators
 
02:27:49.270 --> 02:27:49.280 align:start position:0%
existing law cannot tell you how you can
 
02:27:50.790 --> 02:27:50.800 align:start position:0%
make future law only the new hampshire
 
02:27:52.469 --> 02:27:52.479 align:start position:0%
state constitution can do that if
 
02:27:54.309 --> 02:27:54.319 align:start position:0%
there's concerns about the public having
 
02:27:55.750 --> 02:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
a hearing i'd like to welcome you to the
 
02:27:57.110 --> 02:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
02:27:58.550 --> 02:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
about making this section of the
 
02:28:00.230 --> 02:28:00.240 align:start position:0%
merrimack river a public designated
 
02:28:03.270 --> 02:28:03.280 align:start position:0%
community river um so i i find those um
 
02:28:04.710 --> 02:28:04.720 align:start position:0%
i find those
 
02:28:04.720 --> 02:28:06.070 align:start position:0%
i find those
um

02:28:06.070 --> 02:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:08.630 --> 02:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
reasons for opposition to be
 
02:28:10.389 --> 02:28:10.399 align:start position:0%
let's say uh we're talking about rivers
 
02:28:12.550 --> 02:28:12.560 align:start position:0%
so shallow
 
02:28:15.110 --> 02:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
but i have worked with des on this my
 
02:28:16.309 --> 02:28:16.319 align:start position:0%
understanding is they are supportive of
 
02:28:19.590 --> 02:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
the concept of making the river giving
 
02:28:22.550 --> 02:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
this river its designation
 
02:28:24.550 --> 02:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to go through some of the
 
02:28:26.950 --> 02:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
i have it here some of the protections
 
02:28:29.590 --> 02:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
outside of the 250
 
02:28:31.110 --> 02:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
foot abatement
 
02:28:32.790 --> 02:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
for sorry i'm looking up all the headway
 
02:28:32.800 --> 02:28:34.950 align:start position:0%
for sorry i'm looking up all the headway
speed

02:28:34.950 --> 02:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
speed
 
02:28:36.950 --> 02:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
so you can still drive your boat uh you
 
02:28:38.389 --> 02:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
can't drive your boat super fast within
 
02:28:40.230 --> 02:28:40.240 align:start position:0%
150 feet of the shoreline merrimack
 
02:28:42.070 --> 02:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
river is about 600 feet wide not a
 
02:28:42.080 --> 02:28:43.750 align:start position:0%
river is about 600 feet wide not a
problem

02:28:43.750 --> 02:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
problem
 
02:28:45.349 --> 02:28:45.359 align:start position:0%
you can still build new hydroelectric
 
02:28:47.110 --> 02:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
facilities so if we decide to build more
 
02:28:48.950 --> 02:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
hydro we can continue to do that you
 
02:28:50.710 --> 02:28:50.720 align:start position:0%
have to have a fish ladder the only
 
02:28:52.550 --> 02:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
existing height there's two existing
 
02:28:54.309 --> 02:28:54.319 align:start position:0%
hydro facilities in manchester one of
 
02:28:55.590 --> 02:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
them's really small only operates in the
 
02:28:56.870 --> 02:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
spring and summer
 
02:28:58.710 --> 02:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
and the big one the yamaskeg break guess
 
02:29:00.469 --> 02:29:00.479 align:start position:0%
what it has a fish ladder you can go and
 
02:29:02.309 --> 02:29:02.319 align:start position:0%
visit it it's called the the sea center
 
02:29:03.590 --> 02:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
it's very nice you can look at it you
 
02:29:05.429 --> 02:29:05.439 align:start position:0%
can see the little salmon
 
02:29:07.110 --> 02:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
swimming up it's really nice
 
02:29:09.110 --> 02:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
um you can still expand existing
 
02:29:10.870 --> 02:29:10.880 align:start position:0%
landfills you just can't build a new one
 
02:29:13.349 --> 02:29:13.359 align:start position:0%
within 250 feet which i don't know who
 
02:29:17.110 --> 02:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
wants to build a a new landfill um
 
02:29:18.870 --> 02:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
and you sorry not to the landfill
 
02:29:21.110 --> 02:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
exceptions not 250 it's 100. so it's 100
 
02:29:23.750 --> 02:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
feet uh of the shoreline or the 500 year
 
02:29:25.349 --> 02:29:25.359 align:start position:0%
floodplain so the landfill can't flood
 
02:29:27.349 --> 02:29:27.359 align:start position:0%
and flood back into the river every 500
 
02:29:30.469 --> 02:29:30.479 align:start position:0%
years but it's a very very minimal
 
02:29:32.309 --> 02:29:32.319 align:start position:0%
designation it's not going to change
 
02:29:35.110 --> 02:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
things really much at all other than
 
02:29:36.630 --> 02:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
make have this committee and this body
 
02:29:38.230 --> 02:29:38.240 align:start position:0%
make the statement that hey let's not
 
02:29:39.910 --> 02:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
pollute the merrimack this is this is a
 
02:29:41.270 --> 02:29:41.280 align:start position:0%
community river let's put it with the
 
02:29:47.670 --> 02:29:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:53.590 --> 02:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:55.110 --> 02:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
02:30:02.230 --> 02:30:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:04.230 --> 02:30:04.240 align:start position:0%
you have a question representative
 
02:30:07.190 --> 02:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
harvey bullion for our question
 
02:30:09.590 --> 02:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
representative uh
 
02:30:12.150 --> 02:30:12.160 align:start position:0%
can you tell me how this would impact uh
 
02:30:14.309 --> 02:30:14.319 align:start position:0%
building permits
 
02:30:14.319 --> 02:30:15.429 align:start position:0%
building permits
um

02:30:15.429 --> 02:30:15.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:30:17.590 --> 02:30:17.600 align:start position:0%
so des may be better suited to answer
 
02:30:19.830 --> 02:30:19.840 align:start position:0%
that but my understanding is it won't um
 
02:30:21.750 --> 02:30:21.760 align:start position:0%
when i spoke with ds initially they may
 
02:30:22.870 --> 02:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
have to do
 
02:30:24.630 --> 02:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
to just notify
 
02:30:24.640 --> 02:30:25.429 align:start position:0%
to just notify
the

02:30:25.429 --> 02:30:25.439 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:30:27.429 --> 02:30:27.439 align:start position:0%
existing community
 
02:30:29.110 --> 02:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
group that oversees it but it's not they
 
02:30:31.030 --> 02:30:31.040 align:start position:0%
don't get approval it's literally hey i
 
02:30:32.389 --> 02:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
planned on doing this
 
02:30:35.110 --> 02:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
but it mostly only pertains to
 
02:30:37.429 --> 02:30:37.439 align:start position:0%
the building of new waste facilities and
 
02:30:41.510 --> 02:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:43.429 --> 02:30:43.439 align:start position:0%
leech fields
 
02:30:44.630 --> 02:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
going in because that's obviously a
 
02:30:46.150 --> 02:30:46.160 align:start position:0%
concern specifically for bedford and
 
02:30:48.150 --> 02:30:48.160 align:start position:0%
hooksett there are sec parts of those
 
02:30:50.070 --> 02:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
communities that are not on community
 
02:30:51.590 --> 02:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
water systems yet
 
02:30:52.630 --> 02:30:52.640 align:start position:0%
and obviously didn't want to do it and
 
02:30:54.230 --> 02:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
they assured me it was not a problem you
 
02:30:55.830 --> 02:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
can you could they could still get their
 
02:30:56.790 --> 02:30:56.800 align:start position:0%
leach fields in they can still make
 
02:30:58.150 --> 02:30:58.160 align:start position:0%
their new developments
 
02:31:00.230 --> 02:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
it is a designation that this river it's
 
02:31:01.990 --> 02:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
a it's a designation of the river and
 
02:31:03.349 --> 02:31:03.359 align:start position:0%
bringing it into
 
02:31:05.110 --> 02:31:05.120 align:start position:0%
where it is the irony is it's the
 
02:31:07.030 --> 02:31:07.040 align:start position:0%
designation exists to the north the
 
02:31:13.030 --> 02:31:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:14.950 --> 02:31:14.960 align:start position:0%

apologized to the sponsor for
 
02:32:10.070 --> 02:32:10.080 align:start position:0%

um
 
02:32:16.230 --> 02:32:16.240 align:start position:0%
that letter was sent before final review
 
02:32:17.910 --> 02:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
and it won't happen again and we
 
02:32:20.550 --> 02:32:20.560 align:start position:0%
apologize so i thought it was important
 
02:32:22.950 --> 02:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
to clear up where we are on this issue
 
02:32:25.750 --> 02:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
number one we do support the underlying
 
02:32:25.760 --> 02:32:26.630 align:start position:0%
number one we do support the underlying
goal

02:32:26.630 --> 02:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
goal
 
02:32:28.550 --> 02:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
of the issue
 
02:32:30.469 --> 02:32:30.479 align:start position:0%
of the bill that
 
02:32:33.750 --> 02:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
representative barry brought forward
 
02:32:35.510 --> 02:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
number two
 
02:32:36.790 --> 02:32:36.800 align:start position:0%
there was some
 
02:32:39.190 --> 02:32:39.200 align:start position:0%
there is a process in terms of involving
 
02:32:41.190 --> 02:32:41.200 align:start position:0%
the public we've already offered
 
02:32:42.950 --> 02:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
representative barry will work with him
 
02:32:44.950 --> 02:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
on getting letters from the three
 
02:32:44.960 --> 02:32:46.230 align:start position:0%
on getting letters from the three
communities

02:32:46.230 --> 02:32:46.240 align:start position:0%
communities
 
02:32:48.150 --> 02:32:48.160 align:start position:0%
that can be added to the record for you
 
02:32:49.190 --> 02:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
all to
 
02:32:51.429 --> 02:32:51.439 align:start position:0%
consider as part of it i'm showing their
 
02:32:53.030 --> 02:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
support which
 
02:32:54.469 --> 02:32:54.479 align:start position:0%
would make us a lot more comfortable in
 
02:32:56.950 --> 02:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
terms of that public outreach aspect
 
02:32:59.750 --> 02:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
um and we're also very grateful to
 
02:32:59.760 --> 02:33:01.030 align:start position:0%
um and we're also very grateful to
um

02:33:01.030 --> 02:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:33:02.550 --> 02:33:02.560 align:start position:0%
representative barry he didn't mention
 
02:33:05.110 --> 02:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
his testimony i hate this before but i
 
02:33:07.030 --> 02:33:07.040 align:start position:0%
think if you ask them he said he was
 
02:33:09.830 --> 02:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
very open to the amendment we suggested
 
02:33:10.950 --> 02:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
in the letter
 
02:33:12.790 --> 02:33:12.800 align:start position:0%
that we sent all of you that will clean
 
02:33:15.590 --> 02:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
up the underlying statute itself and
 
02:33:17.110 --> 02:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
we think we'll really improve the
 
02:33:17.120 --> 02:33:19.590 align:start position:0%
we think we'll really improve the
statute

02:33:19.590 --> 02:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
statute
 
02:33:22.150 --> 02:33:22.160 align:start position:0%

02:34:55.270 --> 02:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
us too um the question i have is that
 
02:34:58.070 --> 02:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
you know we do have a process in place
 
02:35:00.070 --> 02:35:00.080 align:start position:0%
for the rivers program and how rivers
 
02:35:01.990 --> 02:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
are designated and we have had other
 
02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:03.110 align:start position:0%
are designated and we have had other
rivers

02:35:03.110 --> 02:35:03.120 align:start position:0%
rivers
 
02:35:05.110 --> 02:35:05.120 align:start position:0%

02:35:07.110 --> 02:35:07.120 align:start position:0%
approval here
 
02:35:10.469 --> 02:35:10.479 align:start position:0%
and it seems like that process has not
 
02:35:10.479 --> 02:35:11.590 align:start position:0%
and it seems like that process has not
happened

02:35:11.590 --> 02:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
happened
 
02:35:14.469 --> 02:35:14.479 align:start position:0%
and are you saying that the letter from
 
02:35:14.479 --> 02:35:16.710 align:start position:0%

written in it
so

02:36:05.429 --> 02:36:05.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:36:07.750 --> 02:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
that's seems like more than just two or
 
02:36:09.670 --> 02:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
three communities oh but part of it is
 
02:36:11.830 --> 02:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
already got it
 
02:36:19.510 --> 02:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:25.110 --> 02:36:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:29.030 --> 02:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:32.070 --> 02:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
anyone else for uh questions
 
02:36:36.630 --> 02:36:36.640 align:start position:0%
uh actually maybe i'll i'll ask one uh
 
02:36:39.190 --> 02:36:39.200 align:start position:0%
i maybe someone already knows i'll have
 
02:36:40.870 --> 02:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
to try to find out
 
02:36:42.710 --> 02:36:42.720 align:start position:0%
if it goes to the massachusetts line it
 
02:36:44.230 --> 02:36:44.240 align:start position:0%
goes right past
 
02:36:46.660 --> 02:36:46.670 align:start position:0%
hudson and litchfield
 
02:36:46.670 --> 02:36:47.750 align:start position:0%
hudson and litchfield
[Music]

02:36:47.750 --> 02:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:37:16.710 --> 02:37:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:19.590 --> 02:37:19.600 align:start position:0%
okay fine all right uh anyway
 
02:37:21.270 --> 02:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
representative creighton
 
02:37:23.030 --> 02:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
yes mr chair thank you very much mr
 
02:37:24.950 --> 02:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
sanborn thank you and it's a follow-up
 
02:37:26.550 --> 02:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
to representative smith's question just
 
02:37:28.870 --> 02:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
to make sure i'm understanding with
 
02:37:30.389 --> 02:37:30.399 align:start position:0%
these three letters
 
02:37:32.630 --> 02:37:32.640 align:start position:0%
does that meet the rsa requirement
 
02:37:32.640 --> 02:37:34.469 align:start position:0%
does that meet the rsa requirement
procedurally

02:37:34.469 --> 02:37:34.479 align:start position:0%
procedurally
 
02:37:34.479 --> 02:37:45.429 align:start position:0%
procedurally
so

02:37:45.429 --> 02:37:45.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:47.429 --> 02:37:47.439 align:start position:0%
is just um to show deference to our
 
02:37:59.030 --> 02:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:02.309 --> 02:38:02.319 align:start position:0%
uh branch know under your authority so
 
02:38:07.110 --> 02:38:07.120 align:start position:0%
our goal was to try and um
 
02:38:09.190 --> 02:38:09.200 align:start position:0%
use the combination of during public
 
02:38:11.830 --> 02:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
hearings we're having one right now
 
02:38:13.990 --> 02:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
the discussion will be held in public
 
02:38:16.389 --> 02:38:16.399 align:start position:0%
and outreach the community was just our
 
02:38:18.870 --> 02:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
goal of making the best with the
 
02:38:18.880 --> 02:38:20.150 align:start position:0%
goal of making the best with the
situation

02:38:20.150 --> 02:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
situation
 
02:38:21.670 --> 02:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
um but
 
02:38:24.070 --> 02:38:24.080 align:start position:0%
no that that is not how the rsa process
 
02:38:26.550 --> 02:38:26.560 align:start position:0%
would have been followed
 
02:38:28.870 --> 02:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
and for a follow-up sir
 
02:38:44.070 --> 02:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:46.630 --> 02:38:46.640 align:start position:0%
a lot more interaction with the
 
02:38:46.640 --> 02:38:48.550 align:start position:0%
a lot more interaction with the
communities

02:38:48.550 --> 02:38:48.560 align:start position:0%
communities
 
02:38:48.560 --> 02:38:50.070 align:start position:0%
communities
and

02:38:50.070 --> 02:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:38:50.080 --> 02:38:56.070 align:start position:0%
and
opportunities

02:38:56.070 --> 02:38:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:00.150 --> 02:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:01.910 --> 02:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
um this is a comment i believe the
 
02:39:05.030 --> 02:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
speaker does not have his microphone on
 
02:39:07.190 --> 02:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
because people are texting me saying
 
02:39:08.790 --> 02:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
they can't hear at home
 
02:39:10.870 --> 02:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
very good you were right the whole time
 
02:39:12.710 --> 02:39:12.720 align:start position:0%
luckily i'm pretty loud so you probably
 
02:39:19.670 --> 02:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:21.670 --> 02:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
seeing no other questions thank you very
 
02:39:23.270 --> 02:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
much thank you mr chair and committee
 
02:39:25.270 --> 02:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
members appreciate it
 
02:39:25.280 --> 02:39:28.950 align:start position:0%
members appreciate it
now

02:39:28.950 --> 02:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:40.630 --> 02:39:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:42.469 --> 02:39:42.479 align:start position:0%
press the button i can do that you're
 
02:39:46.070 --> 02:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
right i'm qualified
 
02:39:47.830 --> 02:39:47.840 align:start position:0%
thank you uh mr chair members of the
 
02:39:49.510 --> 02:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
committee it's a pleasure to be in front
 
02:39:52.389 --> 02:39:52.399 align:start position:0%
of you here today my name is ted diers
 
02:39:54.070 --> 02:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
and i am the administrator of the
 
02:39:56.070 --> 02:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
watershed management bureau
 
02:39:58.070 --> 02:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry watershed management bureau at
 
02:40:00.389 --> 02:40:00.399 align:start position:0%
the department of environmental services
 
02:40:03.270 --> 02:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
and um i am going to speak to the second
 
02:40:06.550 --> 02:40:06.560 align:start position:0%
part of our letter which was regarding
 
02:40:09.270 --> 02:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
the original legislation that caused the
 
02:40:11.670 --> 02:40:11.680 align:start position:0%
creation of the merrimack designation
 
02:40:14.150 --> 02:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
back in 1990
 
02:40:16.070 --> 02:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
citation occurred and there was some
 
02:40:16.080 --> 02:40:21.429 align:start position:0%
citation occurred and there was some
language

02:40:21.429 --> 02:40:21.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:23.110 --> 02:40:23.120 align:start position:0%
put into the bill at that time that
 
02:40:23.120 --> 02:40:24.389 align:start position:0%
put into the bill at that time that
restricted

02:40:24.389 --> 02:40:24.399 align:start position:0%
restricted
 
02:40:26.070 --> 02:40:26.080 align:start position:0%
uh well you could either look at it
 
02:40:28.630 --> 02:40:28.640 align:start position:0%
restricted or allocated a certain
 
02:40:30.870 --> 02:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
portion of flow to the pentachuck
 
02:40:30.880 --> 02:40:32.230 align:start position:0%
portion of flow to the pentachuck
waterworks

02:40:32.230 --> 02:40:32.240 align:start position:0%
waterworks
 
02:40:34.550 --> 02:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
so this is an interesting artifact
 
02:40:36.950 --> 02:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
of the ancient now becoming ancient
 
02:40:39.190 --> 02:40:39.200 align:start position:0%
history now of of the river's
 
02:40:39.200 --> 02:40:40.550 align:start position:0%
history now of of the river's
designation

02:40:40.550 --> 02:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
designation
 
02:40:43.429 --> 02:40:43.439 align:start position:0%
that um looked at what was going to
 
02:40:45.830 --> 02:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
happen under in-stream flow protection
 
02:40:47.830 --> 02:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
at that time and i started looking at
 
02:40:49.590 --> 02:40:49.600 align:start position:0%
in-stream flow rules in new hampshire in
 
02:40:49.600 --> 02:40:51.510 align:start position:0%
in-stream flow rules in new hampshire in
1993

02:40:51.510 --> 02:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
1993
 
02:40:54.150 --> 02:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
when i was working for a non-profit and
 
02:40:56.469 --> 02:40:56.479 align:start position:0%
so it's been a really long
 
02:40:58.550 --> 02:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
and interesting journey to get to the
 
02:41:00.230 --> 02:41:00.240 align:start position:0%
point we are today
 
02:41:02.070 --> 02:41:02.080 align:start position:0%
but back then the conversation was
 
02:41:03.750 --> 02:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
really about some of the rudimentary
 
02:41:05.269 --> 02:41:05.279 align:start position:0%
ways we were thinking about in-stream
 
02:41:05.279 --> 02:41:06.230 align:start position:0%
ways we were thinking about in-stream
flow

02:41:06.230 --> 02:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
flow
 
02:41:07.990 --> 02:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
things that could have had draconian
 
02:41:12.150 --> 02:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
limits placed on to certain activities
 
02:41:13.830 --> 02:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
um and so
 
02:41:16.070 --> 02:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
over the years as you all have been
 
02:41:18.070 --> 02:41:18.080 align:start position:0%
aware because many of you have followed
 
02:41:20.550 --> 02:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
this journey over the years have now a
 
02:41:26.150 --> 02:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:28.870 --> 02:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
that is river specific and highly
 
02:41:31.429 --> 02:41:31.439 align:start position:0%
scientific way of looking at in-stream
 
02:41:34.150 --> 02:41:34.160 align:start position:0%
flow and what we have found is that it
 
02:41:37.110 --> 02:41:37.120 align:start position:0%
is extraordinarily fair to the water
 
02:41:39.349 --> 02:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
users and make sure that people get the
 
02:41:42.469 --> 02:41:42.479 align:start position:0%
water they need at the same time
 
02:41:44.870 --> 02:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
that we protect the biota within our
 
02:41:47.429 --> 02:41:47.439 align:start position:0%
rivers so the system is really working
 
02:41:49.830 --> 02:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
so so what you see here is a relic
 
02:41:52.309 --> 02:41:52.319 align:start position:0%
of that old conversation
 
02:41:54.790 --> 02:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
given and i know you are well well aware
 
02:41:57.349 --> 02:41:57.359 align:start position:0%
of this given where many of you are from
 
02:41:59.510 --> 02:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
the issues with pfas and other issues
 
02:42:01.910 --> 02:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
with contaminated drinking water it does
 
02:42:05.590 --> 02:42:05.600 align:start position:0%
not seem prudent to be limiting specific
 
02:42:07.830 --> 02:42:07.840 align:start position:0%
intakes for specific
 
02:42:11.269 --> 02:42:11.279 align:start position:0%
to specific flows any longer because we
 
02:42:13.110 --> 02:42:13.120 align:start position:0%
have a really good methodology to make
 
02:42:15.190 --> 02:42:15.200 align:start position:0%
sure that that we don't impact the river
 
02:42:16.630 --> 02:42:16.640 align:start position:0%
with water use
 
02:42:19.830 --> 02:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
and we have a need now for flexibility
 
02:42:22.630 --> 02:42:22.640 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we can we can address
 
02:42:24.630 --> 02:42:24.640 align:start position:0%
the very significant
 
02:42:26.950 --> 02:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
water quality and drinking water issues
 
02:42:29.269 --> 02:42:29.279 align:start position:0%
which you all have heard much about uh
 
02:42:30.870 --> 02:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
in front of your committee
 
02:42:34.309 --> 02:42:34.319 align:start position:0%
so uh we have recommended a uh
 
02:42:36.790 --> 02:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
an amendment to this bill uh it's been
 
02:42:39.349 --> 02:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
discussed uh with a sponsor
 
02:42:41.830 --> 02:42:41.840 align:start position:0%
and the idea here is basically to take
 
02:42:43.990 --> 02:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
out that language and this would be very
 
02:42:45.830 --> 02:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
much what all of the other designated
 
02:42:48.070 --> 02:42:48.080 align:start position:0%
rivers have they don't have specific
 
02:42:50.469 --> 02:42:50.479 align:start position:0%
either limits or allocations to specific
 
02:42:52.790 --> 02:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
water users this would put them sort of
 
02:42:54.630 --> 02:42:54.640 align:start position:0%
at par with everything else we've also
 
02:42:56.070 --> 02:42:56.080 align:start position:0%
discussed this with pennichuck water
 
02:42:56.080 --> 02:42:57.110 align:start position:0%
discussed this with pennichuck water
works

02:42:57.110 --> 02:42:57.120 align:start position:0%
works
 
02:42:59.750 --> 02:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
clearly they were named in this and they
 
02:43:01.670 --> 02:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
too and i'm not sure if you've gotten a
 
02:43:03.510 --> 02:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
letter from penichak yet or not but we
 
02:43:05.590 --> 02:43:05.600 align:start position:0%
have had conversations with them they
 
02:43:07.349 --> 02:43:07.359 align:start position:0%
too favor
 
02:43:09.670 --> 02:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
the removal of this language from that
 
02:43:09.680 --> 02:43:11.429 align:start position:0%
the removal of this language from that
designation

02:43:11.429 --> 02:43:11.439 align:start position:0%
designation
 
02:43:13.269 --> 02:43:13.279 align:start position:0%
i'm going to stop there and see if
 
02:43:15.349 --> 02:43:15.359 align:start position:0%
anyone has any questions
 
02:43:20.710 --> 02:43:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:23.030 --> 02:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
any questions by a member of the
 
02:43:27.190 --> 02:43:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:29.269 --> 02:43:29.279 align:start position:0%
representative smith thank you very much
 
02:43:31.750 --> 02:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
and thank you mr dears for taking my
 
02:43:32.950 --> 02:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
question and welcome back to the
 
02:43:32.960 --> 02:43:33.990 align:start position:0%
question and welcome back to the
committee

02:43:33.990 --> 02:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:43:36.870 --> 02:43:36.880 align:start position:0%
um so you were commenting pretty much
 
02:43:39.590 --> 02:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
just on the part that talks which is
 
02:43:42.230 --> 02:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
related to the in-stream flow
 
02:43:42.240 --> 02:43:43.349 align:start position:0%
related to the in-stream flow
program

02:43:43.349 --> 02:43:43.359 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:43:47.990 --> 02:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
um on the part of the part two of the
 
02:43:50.870 --> 02:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
of the letter yes ma'am okay
 
02:43:53.429 --> 02:43:53.439 align:start position:0%

speaking you you're not the person are
 
02:43:58.309 --> 02:43:58.319 align:start position:0%
you the person to ask about what is
 
02:44:00.230 --> 02:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
required what are all the rules for
 
02:44:02.150 --> 02:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
designating a river that we presently
 
02:44:04.790 --> 02:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
have in statute so what i'm going to do
 
02:44:06.790 --> 02:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
is i'm going to bring tracy sales up who
 
02:44:09.030 --> 02:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
is our rivers and management uh rivers
 
02:44:10.710 --> 02:44:10.720 align:start position:0%
and lakes management
 
02:44:13.670 --> 02:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
rivers and lakes programs manager
 
02:44:15.190 --> 02:44:15.200 align:start position:0%
did i get it all right
 
02:44:17.349 --> 02:44:17.359 align:start position:0%
administrator goodness gracious so tracy
 
02:44:18.950 --> 02:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
if you could come on up here
 
02:44:21.269 --> 02:44:21.279 align:start position:0%
and talk a little bit about what some of
 
02:44:22.630 --> 02:44:22.640 align:start position:0%
those other
 
02:44:25.030 --> 02:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
aspects of nominations
 
02:44:26.630 --> 02:44:26.640 align:start position:0%
would include
 
02:44:28.630 --> 02:44:28.640 align:start position:0%
um and
 
02:44:34.070 --> 02:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:35.990 --> 02:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is tracy sills i
 
02:44:37.510 --> 02:44:37.520 align:start position:0%
am the rivers and lakes programs
 
02:44:38.710 --> 02:44:38.720 align:start position:0%
administrator at the new hampshire
 
02:44:41.990 --> 02:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services
 
02:44:44.309 --> 02:44:44.319 align:start position:0%
under normal circumstances when a river
 
02:44:46.230 --> 02:44:46.240 align:start position:0%
is nominated into the rivers management
 
02:44:48.309 --> 02:44:48.319 align:start position:0%
and protection program
 
02:44:50.309 --> 02:44:50.319 align:start position:0%
this comes from a group of local
 
02:44:52.389 --> 02:44:52.399 align:start position:0%
citizens interested in protecting their
 
02:44:54.230 --> 02:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
river they are interested in working
 
02:44:54.240 --> 02:44:55.990 align:start position:0%
river they are interested in working
together

02:44:55.990 --> 02:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
together
 
02:44:57.590 --> 02:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
between the towns that share the
 
02:44:59.190 --> 02:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
resource of the river and also working
 
02:45:01.670 --> 02:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
together more closely with the state
 
02:45:03.830 --> 02:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
to better protect their river
 
02:45:06.389 --> 02:45:06.399 align:start position:0%
so this is a grassroots effort typically
 
02:45:08.790 --> 02:45:08.800 align:start position:0%
and what would normally happen is that
 
02:45:11.830 --> 02:45:11.840 align:start position:0%
group would start by putting together
 
02:45:14.070 --> 02:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
a resource assessment what is what is
 
02:45:16.309 --> 02:45:16.319 align:start position:0%
special about the river and why should
 
02:45:18.790 --> 02:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
it be uh protected what are the problems
 
02:45:20.230 --> 02:45:20.240 align:start position:0%
with the river whether that's water
 
02:45:22.230 --> 02:45:22.240 align:start position:0%
quality or development or anything else
 
02:45:24.870 --> 02:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
that you know what threats are are out
 
02:45:24.880 --> 02:45:26.070 align:start position:0%
that you know what threats are are out
there

02:45:26.070 --> 02:45:26.080 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:45:29.670 --> 02:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
on this river so they put together a
 
02:45:33.429 --> 02:45:33.439 align:start position:0%
you know 50-page plus document
 
02:45:35.349 --> 02:45:35.359 align:start position:0%
which really looks at and examines
 
02:45:37.269 --> 02:45:37.279 align:start position:0%
what's going on on the river
 
02:45:40.070 --> 02:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
based on that they then say we really
 
02:45:42.389 --> 02:45:42.399 align:start position:0%
want to protect this river they bring
 
02:45:46.309 --> 02:45:46.319 align:start position:0%
that to the various towns within the
 
02:45:47.670 --> 02:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
length of the river that they're going
 
02:45:49.110 --> 02:45:49.120 align:start position:0%
to do
 
02:45:52.630 --> 02:45:52.640 align:start position:0%
they also contact every single riparian
 
02:45:55.190 --> 02:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
landowner along that stretch of river
 
02:45:56.870 --> 02:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
and say hey here's what we're looking at
 
02:45:58.870 --> 02:45:58.880 align:start position:0%
doing they hold information meetings
 
02:46:00.790 --> 02:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
they hold public hearings
 
02:46:02.469 --> 02:46:02.479 align:start position:0%
to make sure that everybody has been
 
02:46:02.479 --> 02:46:04.710 align:start position:0%
to make sure that everybody has been
heard

02:46:04.710 --> 02:46:04.720 align:start position:0%
heard
 
02:46:06.870 --> 02:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
once that is done
 
02:46:08.790 --> 02:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
we contact you we have public hearings
 
02:46:08.800 --> 02:46:10.389 align:start position:0%
we contact you we have public hearings
with

02:46:10.389 --> 02:46:10.399 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:46:10.399 --> 02:46:12.070 align:start position:0%
with
the

02:46:12.070 --> 02:46:12.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:46:14.469 --> 02:46:14.479 align:start position:0%
this committee as well as the the senate
 
02:46:16.630 --> 02:46:16.640 align:start position:0%
energy and natural resources committee
 
02:46:20.630 --> 02:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
um that document and then goes to the
 
02:46:22.630 --> 02:46:22.640 align:start position:0%
commissioner of des to
 
02:46:26.870 --> 02:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
for his approval then we write a bill
 
02:46:29.190 --> 02:46:29.200 align:start position:0%
then we come to you guys and say
 
02:46:30.710 --> 02:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
this is what we'd like to do here are
 
02:46:32.230 --> 02:46:32.240 align:start position:0%
all the people that support it here's
 
02:46:33.990 --> 02:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
why we want to do it and here's the
 
02:46:35.750 --> 02:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
background research that indicates why
 
02:46:38.150 --> 02:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
that should be done in addition this is
 
02:46:39.910 --> 02:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
also vetted by the rivers management
 
02:46:41.670 --> 02:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
advisory committee and the chair of that
 
02:46:43.990 --> 02:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
committee is here today
 
02:46:45.830 --> 02:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
so the statewide rivers management
 
02:46:47.429 --> 02:46:47.439 align:start position:0%
advisory committee will also look at
 
02:46:47.439 --> 02:46:48.309 align:start position:0%
advisory committee will also look at
this

02:46:48.309 --> 02:46:48.319 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:46:50.550 --> 02:46:50.560 align:start position:0%
to determine whether or not this
 
02:46:52.790 --> 02:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
nomination into the program is
 
02:46:52.800 --> 02:46:54.309 align:start position:0%
nomination into the program is
appropriate

02:46:54.309 --> 02:46:54.319 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
02:46:56.469 --> 02:46:56.479 align:start position:0%
under the rules of the program
 
02:47:02.950 --> 02:47:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:04.950 --> 02:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
that's a very different
 
02:47:07.670 --> 02:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
process do you feel that that is an
 
02:47:10.710 --> 02:47:10.720 align:start position:0%
effective process
 
02:47:12.710 --> 02:47:12.720 align:start position:0%
i do and i think it worked really well
 
02:47:14.710 --> 02:47:14.720 align:start position:0%
in the last designation that we had
 
02:47:17.110 --> 02:47:17.120 align:start position:0%
which was for the warner river and the
 
02:47:18.469 --> 02:47:18.479 align:start position:0%
warner river
 
02:47:20.070 --> 02:47:20.080 align:start position:0%
actually was a three-year nomination
 
02:47:21.910 --> 02:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
process and it took that long because
 
02:47:23.349 --> 02:47:23.359 align:start position:0%
there were people who were not
 
02:47:25.750 --> 02:47:25.760 align:start position:0%
comfortable with a couple of the
 
02:47:28.550 --> 02:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
provisions that would have
 
02:47:30.630 --> 02:47:30.640 align:start position:0%
been made under the original original
 
02:47:33.910 --> 02:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
proposal for the designation there were
 
02:47:33.920 --> 02:47:34.710 align:start position:0%
proposal for the designation there were
some

02:47:34.710 --> 02:47:34.720 align:start position:0%
some
 
02:47:36.230 --> 02:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
dam owners in particular who were
 
02:47:38.150 --> 02:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
concerned and so the nominating
 
02:47:40.550 --> 02:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
committee worked with those dam owners
 
02:47:42.469 --> 02:47:42.479 align:start position:0%
changed some of the
 
02:47:44.870 --> 02:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
classifications that representative
 
02:47:47.429 --> 02:47:47.439 align:start position:0%
barry had been talking about
 
02:47:50.150 --> 02:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
and made it so that everybody was could
 
02:47:51.910 --> 02:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
accept and was happy with that
 
02:47:51.920 --> 02:47:53.670 align:start position:0%
accept and was happy with that
designation

02:47:53.670 --> 02:47:53.680 align:start position:0%
designation
 
02:47:55.510 --> 02:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:48:00.830 --> 02:48:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:05.429 --> 02:48:05.439 align:start position:0%
um all of a sudden i went blank um
 
02:48:07.830 --> 02:48:07.840 align:start position:0%
never mind thank you
 
02:48:10.710 --> 02:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
representative representative harp for a
 
02:48:12.870 --> 02:48:12.880 align:start position:0%
question thank you mr chair and thank
 
02:48:14.630 --> 02:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question this is a
 
02:48:17.349 --> 02:48:17.359 align:start position:0%
historical question for me
 
02:48:19.590 --> 02:48:19.600 align:start position:0%
and you may not have the answer but it
 
02:48:22.070 --> 02:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
was mentioned that we as a committee in
 
02:48:24.950 --> 02:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
the legislature have a power to overrule
 
02:48:27.429 --> 02:48:27.439 align:start position:0%
the process that was mentioned
 
02:48:29.510 --> 02:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
do you know if any other section of the
 
02:48:32.309 --> 02:48:32.319 align:start position:0%
merrimack river has bypassed
 
02:48:35.269 --> 02:48:35.279 align:start position:0%
that public hearing session like are we
 
02:48:37.429 --> 02:48:37.439 align:start position:0%
setting a precedent or is this the first
 
02:48:39.030 --> 02:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
portion of the merrimack river where
 
02:48:41.910 --> 02:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
we're bypassing all this public
 
02:48:44.230 --> 02:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
uh information and all that input that
 
02:48:45.830 --> 02:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
you just gave us
 
02:48:47.510 --> 02:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
this is the first time that i know of
 
02:48:49.750 --> 02:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
that this process has been bypassed all
 
02:48:52.630 --> 02:48:52.640 align:start position:0%
of the other uh 19 rivers and river
 
02:48:54.070 --> 02:48:54.080 align:start position:0%
segments that have been designated in
 
02:48:56.790 --> 02:48:56.800 align:start position:0%
the past have followed the process in
 
02:48:59.190 --> 02:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
statute and rule
 
02:49:01.429 --> 02:49:01.439 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:49:03.990 --> 02:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
this isn't this is an attempt to bypass
 
02:49:05.750 --> 02:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
right this
 
02:49:07.910 --> 02:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
hasn't been bypassed yet
 
02:49:07.920 --> 02:49:09.670 align:start position:0%
hasn't been bypassed yet
uh

02:49:09.670 --> 02:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:49:09.680 --> 02:49:10.469 align:start position:0%
uh
who

02:49:10.469 --> 02:49:10.479 align:start position:0%
who
 
02:49:14.230 --> 02:49:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:16.150 --> 02:49:16.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
02:49:18.550 --> 02:49:18.560 align:start position:0%
your information you gave us today um i
 
02:49:21.750 --> 02:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
just wonder if bypassing that system is
 
02:49:25.590 --> 02:49:25.600 align:start position:0%
going to create the existing system in
 
02:49:27.590 --> 02:49:27.600 align:start position:0%
bringing this forward
 
02:49:33.590 --> 02:49:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:33.600 --> 02:49:34.790 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:49:34.790 --> 02:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:49:37.269 --> 02:49:37.279 align:start position:0%
just a second um so
 
02:49:39.190 --> 02:49:39.200 align:start position:0%
i think it's an interesting question
 
02:49:41.110 --> 02:49:41.120 align:start position:0%
it hasn't happened before
 
02:49:43.269 --> 02:49:43.279 align:start position:0%
so you know theoretically
 
02:49:45.349 --> 02:49:45.359 align:start position:0%
we don't we don't really know
 
02:49:46.950 --> 02:49:46.960 align:start position:0%
um because this hasn't gone this way
 
02:49:46.960 --> 02:49:47.910 align:start position:0%
um because this hasn't gone this way
before

02:49:47.910 --> 02:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
before
 
02:49:50.389 --> 02:49:50.399 align:start position:0%
i think as tracy described the process
 
02:49:51.910 --> 02:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
has worked really well in the past and
 
02:49:54.710 --> 02:49:54.720 align:start position:0%
it's also worked the opposite way
 
02:49:55.910 --> 02:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
for those of you who are on the
 
02:49:58.870 --> 02:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
committee to remember the uh hem branch
 
02:50:00.630 --> 02:50:00.640 align:start position:0%
remember the ham branch we actually had
 
02:50:02.870 --> 02:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
a subcommittee led by representative
 
02:50:04.550 --> 02:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
rice which i affectionately called the
 
02:50:06.070 --> 02:50:06.080 align:start position:0%
ham and rice committee
 
02:50:06.080 --> 02:50:06.870 align:start position:0%
ham and rice committee
um

02:50:06.870 --> 02:50:06.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:50:08.710 --> 02:50:08.720 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:50:11.429 --> 02:50:11.439 align:start position:0%
in that case uh what the legislature
 
02:50:13.910 --> 02:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
heard at the end of that was that there
 
02:50:15.670 --> 02:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
was not support
 
02:50:17.910 --> 02:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
uh amongst certain parties for the
 
02:50:20.790 --> 02:50:20.800 align:start position:0%
designation and so ultimately and i
 
02:50:22.550 --> 02:50:22.560 align:start position:0%
think this is where representative barry
 
02:50:24.389 --> 02:50:24.399 align:start position:0%
was correct it's you all
 
02:50:26.710 --> 02:50:26.720 align:start position:0%
are the ones who make the final decision
 
02:50:28.790 --> 02:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
about how this goes down
 
02:50:28.800 --> 02:50:29.590 align:start position:0%
about how this goes down
so

02:50:29.590 --> 02:50:29.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:50:32.070 --> 02:50:32.080 align:start position:0%
the process does seem to work
 
02:50:34.790 --> 02:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
whether it becomes on the affirmative or
 
02:50:37.750 --> 02:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
on the negative the the process is good
 
02:50:40.309 --> 02:50:40.319 align:start position:0%
in that it helps to vet
 
02:50:42.710 --> 02:50:42.720 align:start position:0%
all of the concerns so that when you all
 
02:50:44.790 --> 02:50:44.800 align:start position:0%
um have to make a decision you're doing
 
02:50:47.110 --> 02:50:47.120 align:start position:0%
that from an informed perspective so i
 
02:50:49.030 --> 02:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
think that that's really the the only
 
02:50:51.110 --> 02:50:51.120 align:start position:0%
concern that we had about that part of
 
02:50:53.269 --> 02:50:53.279 align:start position:0%
the bill was really about making sure
 
02:50:54.790 --> 02:50:54.800 align:start position:0%
that you all
 
02:50:56.710 --> 02:50:56.720 align:start position:0%
are sitting there with the information
 
02:50:59.590 --> 02:50:59.600 align:start position:0%
that you need to make the decision about
 
02:51:01.670 --> 02:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
how this moves forward so i think you
 
02:51:04.309 --> 02:51:04.319 align:start position:0%
know that's the i think the framework
 
02:51:05.670 --> 02:51:05.680 align:start position:0%
that we come at this with did you have
 
02:51:10.389 --> 02:51:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:12.550 --> 02:51:12.560 align:start position:0%
so again one of the
 
02:51:14.469 --> 02:51:14.479 align:start position:0%
outcomes of designating a river is the
 
02:51:16.950 --> 02:51:16.960 align:start position:0%
formation of a local advisory committee
 
02:51:19.349 --> 02:51:19.359 align:start position:0%
this particular bill
 
02:51:21.510 --> 02:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
would append
 
02:51:26.070 --> 02:51:26.080 align:start position:0%
the manchester uh bedford and
 
02:51:28.070 --> 02:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
hooksett thank you
 
02:51:30.309 --> 02:51:30.319 align:start position:0%
sections two the existing lower
 
02:51:33.349 --> 02:51:33.359 align:start position:0%
merrimack river designation and i was
 
02:51:35.510 --> 02:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
actually having a chat yesterday with
 
02:51:37.590 --> 02:51:37.600 align:start position:0%
the existing a couple of the existing
 
02:51:39.429 --> 02:51:39.439 align:start position:0%
members of the um
 
02:51:40.550 --> 02:51:40.560 align:start position:0%
the lower
 
02:51:42.950 --> 02:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
segment of the river and a they were
 
02:51:46.070 --> 02:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
very surprised about this um and i had
 
02:51:47.590 --> 02:51:47.600 align:start position:0%
had hoped that representative barry
 
02:51:49.110 --> 02:51:49.120 align:start position:0%
would reach out to them
 
02:51:51.030 --> 02:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
but they were not aware of it and they
 
02:51:53.110 --> 02:51:53.120 align:start position:0%
they actually while they support
 
02:51:54.630 --> 02:51:54.640 align:start position:0%
designating the middle section of the
 
02:51:54.640 --> 02:51:55.830 align:start position:0%
designating the middle section of the
merrimack

02:51:55.830 --> 02:51:55.840 align:start position:0%
merrimack
 
02:51:55.840 --> 02:51:56.710 align:start position:0%
merrimack
um

02:51:56.710 --> 02:51:56.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:59.030 --> 02:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
they are they feel like it should be its
 
02:52:00.630 --> 02:52:00.640 align:start position:0%
own committee
 
02:52:02.870 --> 02:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
rather than um
 
02:52:04.469 --> 02:52:04.479 align:start position:0%
being appended to theirs they feel like
 
02:52:05.990 --> 02:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
they have enough work to do
 
02:52:06.000 --> 02:52:07.030 align:start position:0%
they have enough work to do
um

02:52:07.030 --> 02:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:52:07.040 --> 02:52:07.750 align:start position:0%
um
so

02:52:07.750 --> 02:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:52:10.150 --> 02:52:10.160 align:start position:0%
again it's it's part about getting local
 
02:52:11.990 --> 02:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
support but if
 
02:52:12.000 --> 02:52:13.590 align:start position:0%
support but if
um

02:52:13.590 --> 02:52:13.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:52:15.830 --> 02:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
if this were to go through
 
02:52:18.070 --> 02:52:18.080 align:start position:0%
we don't have a base of
 
02:52:18.080 --> 02:52:19.110 align:start position:0%
we don't have a base of
interested

02:52:19.110 --> 02:52:19.120 align:start position:0%
interested
 
02:52:21.269 --> 02:52:21.279 align:start position:0%
community members who are willing to
 
02:52:22.550 --> 02:52:22.560 align:start position:0%
work with
 
02:52:24.309 --> 02:52:24.319 align:start position:0%
the other community members to help
 
02:52:25.590 --> 02:52:25.600 align:start position:0%
protect that river because it's really
 
02:52:27.750 --> 02:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
about the people
 
02:52:45.349 --> 02:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:47.349 --> 02:52:47.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
02:52:51.590 --> 02:52:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:54.150 --> 02:52:54.160 align:start position:0%
normally two years approximately and for
 
02:52:56.070 --> 02:52:56.080 align:start position:0%
a follow-up sir
 
02:52:58.950 --> 02:52:58.960 align:start position:0%
in your work with uh on this bill and
 
02:53:00.150 --> 02:53:00.160 align:start position:0%
and working with the amendment and
 
02:53:00.160 --> 02:53:01.190 align:start position:0%
and working with the amendment and
everything

02:53:01.190 --> 02:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
everything
 
02:53:03.830 --> 02:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
uh do you have a sensing of of what the
 
02:53:05.429 --> 02:53:05.439 align:start position:0%
rush is
 
02:53:08.309 --> 02:53:08.319 align:start position:0%
to bypass this
 
02:53:10.630 --> 02:53:10.640 align:start position:0%
i am
 
02:53:12.469 --> 02:53:12.479 align:start position:0%
again i i think the representative
 
02:53:15.429 --> 02:53:15.439 align:start position:0%
barry's um introduction spoke to his
 
02:53:15.439 --> 02:53:16.630 align:start position:0%
barry's um introduction spoke to his
rationale

02:53:16.630 --> 02:53:16.640 align:start position:0%
rationale
 
02:53:18.469 --> 02:53:18.479 align:start position:0%
for wanting to add this in um i think
 
02:53:20.550 --> 02:53:20.560 align:start position:0%
the certainly the rationale is
 
02:53:20.560 --> 02:53:21.429 align:start position:0%
the certainly the rationale is
um

02:53:21.429 --> 02:53:21.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:53:23.269 --> 02:53:23.279 align:start position:0%
is is the same rationale of why we
 
02:53:24.469 --> 02:53:24.479 align:start position:0%
protect rivers
 
02:53:26.550 --> 02:53:26.560 align:start position:0%
that is that we protect rivers for the
 
02:53:27.750 --> 02:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
for the very
 
02:53:29.670 --> 02:53:29.680 align:start position:0%
for the attributes that they bring the
 
02:53:31.590 --> 02:53:31.600 align:start position:0%
through the love of the river that the
 
02:53:33.990 --> 02:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
people have around it um and he spoke to
 
02:53:36.230 --> 02:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
that so so i don't
 
02:53:37.910 --> 02:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
don't believe that there's any nefarious
 
02:53:40.230 --> 02:53:40.240 align:start position:0%
purpose oh no i'm not that's not my name
 
02:53:41.670 --> 02:53:41.680 align:start position:0%
i'm just curious
 
02:53:43.349 --> 02:53:43.359 align:start position:0%
yeah if there's a process why you
 
02:53:45.670 --> 02:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't follow that so so
 
02:53:47.269 --> 02:53:47.279 align:start position:0%
that it would be a question but i think
 
02:53:49.030 --> 02:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
for the for the representative okay all
 
02:53:55.750 --> 02:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:57.590 --> 02:53:57.600 align:start position:0%
representative smith for a second time
 
02:53:59.910 --> 02:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
and then rep representative post for a
 
02:54:02.150 --> 02:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
second time thank you i remembered my
 
02:54:02.160 --> 02:54:03.030 align:start position:0%
second time thank you i remembered my
question

02:54:03.030 --> 02:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:54:05.910 --> 02:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
um the first time that the process went
 
02:54:08.070 --> 02:54:08.080 align:start position:0%
through it was for the whole river and
 
02:54:10.630 --> 02:54:10.640 align:start position:0%
manchester declined to participate is
 
02:54:15.030 --> 02:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:17.349 --> 02:54:17.359 align:start position:0%
well i have to say 1990 was before my
 
02:54:17.359 --> 02:54:19.030 align:start position:0%
well i have to say 1990 was before my
time

02:54:19.030 --> 02:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:54:21.590 --> 02:54:21.600 align:start position:0%
but my understanding is the proposal
 
02:54:23.510 --> 02:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
initially um
 
02:54:23.520 --> 02:54:24.469 align:start position:0%
initially um
and

02:54:24.469 --> 02:54:24.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:54:25.830 --> 02:54:25.840 align:start position:0%
michelle tremblay may have a little bit
 
02:54:27.750 --> 02:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
more information was for the whole the
 
02:54:30.870 --> 02:54:30.880 align:start position:0%
entire river at the time um
 
02:54:33.349 --> 02:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
as ted was describing there was concern
 
02:54:34.790 --> 02:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
about the in-stream flow program and the
 
02:54:36.710 --> 02:54:36.720 align:start position:0%
restrictions that that might place on
 
02:54:39.269 --> 02:54:39.279 align:start position:0%
manchester so they declined
 
02:54:41.510 --> 02:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
um to participate at that time so we
 
02:54:42.550 --> 02:54:42.560 align:start position:0%
split the
 
02:54:44.309 --> 02:54:44.319 align:start position:0%
merrimack into an upper and lower
 
02:54:48.710 --> 02:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:50.710 --> 02:54:50.720 align:start position:0%
representative post
 
02:54:53.030 --> 02:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up question thank you mr
 
02:54:57.110 --> 02:54:57.120 align:start position:0%
chair so at this point would you
 
02:55:00.150 --> 02:55:00.160 align:start position:0%
make a recommendation at all that that
 
02:55:01.510 --> 02:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
the public it should go through the
 
02:55:04.630 --> 02:55:04.640 align:start position:0%
public system or are you comfortable
 
02:55:07.110 --> 02:55:07.120 align:start position:0%
where you're at well i think that as as
 
02:55:09.269 --> 02:55:09.279 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner sanborn spoke to
 
02:55:09.279 --> 02:55:11.110 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner sanborn spoke to
this

02:55:11.110 --> 02:55:11.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:55:13.670 --> 02:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
we think that you all need to hear from
 
02:55:15.349 --> 02:55:15.359 align:start position:0%
the communities
 
02:55:18.630 --> 02:55:18.640 align:start position:0%
that this river travels through
 
02:55:20.150 --> 02:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
unless they're here today or have
 
02:55:23.030 --> 02:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
provided you testimony already
 
02:55:25.510 --> 02:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
we are not aware that this conversation
 
02:55:28.630 --> 02:55:28.640 align:start position:0%
has happened within the communities
 
02:55:30.230 --> 02:55:30.240 align:start position:0%
and that may have happened but we are
 
02:55:32.710 --> 02:55:32.720 align:start position:0%
not aware of that and we aren't aware of
 
02:55:33.910 --> 02:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
that so we can't bring it to your
 
02:55:36.550 --> 02:55:36.560 align:start position:0%
attention and make you aware of that
 
02:55:38.230 --> 02:55:38.240 align:start position:0%
and so i think this was the concern that
 
02:55:40.389 --> 02:55:40.399 align:start position:0%
we have and i think that at least a next
 
02:55:40.399 --> 02:55:41.510 align:start position:0%
we have and i think that at least a next
step

02:55:41.510 --> 02:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
step
 
02:55:43.590 --> 02:55:43.600 align:start position:0%
and wherever you decide to go after that
 
02:55:45.429 --> 02:55:45.439 align:start position:0%
but certainly the next step would be for
 
02:55:47.750 --> 02:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
you all to hear from the communities
 
02:55:49.670 --> 02:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
that are affected by this particular
 
02:55:52.309 --> 02:55:52.319 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation to understand where
 
02:55:53.910 --> 02:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
they sit on it
 
02:55:55.349 --> 02:55:55.359 align:start position:0%
um because we just don't know that and i
 
02:55:57.349 --> 02:55:57.359 align:start position:0%
think that as representative as
 
02:56:00.150 --> 02:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner sanborn indicated
 
02:56:03.110 --> 02:56:03.120 align:start position:0%
we're certainly helpful certainly help
 
02:56:05.190 --> 02:56:05.200 align:start position:0%
happy to help out sometimes we're
 
02:56:07.910 --> 02:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
helpful sometimes we're not but
 
02:56:10.070 --> 02:56:10.080 align:start position:0%
we are certainly happy to help to
 
02:56:12.309 --> 02:56:12.319 align:start position:0%
identify the the contacts within those
 
02:56:14.550 --> 02:56:14.560 align:start position:0%
communities and make sure that they're
 
02:56:14.560 --> 02:56:15.830 align:start position:0%
communities and make sure that they're
aware

02:56:15.830 --> 02:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
aware
 
02:56:18.790 --> 02:56:18.800 align:start position:0%
of this piece of legislation and
 
02:56:21.590 --> 02:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
afford them the opportunity to be able
 
02:56:24.550 --> 02:56:24.560 align:start position:0%
to at least to help you all be informed
 
02:56:27.910 --> 02:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
about your um decision that would come
 
02:56:29.910 --> 02:56:29.920 align:start position:0%
up on this particular bill so that that
 
02:56:32.630 --> 02:56:32.640 align:start position:0%
was really our perspective is that once
 
02:56:34.710 --> 02:56:34.720 align:start position:0%
you hear from them i think you all will
 
02:56:37.830 --> 02:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity to decide
 
02:56:39.510 --> 02:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
what is your what is the next course of
 
02:56:41.349 --> 02:56:41.359 align:start position:0%
action that you'd like to take do you
 
02:56:42.950 --> 02:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
think that they should do more do you
 
02:56:45.910 --> 02:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
think that that shows substantial um
 
02:56:45.920 --> 02:56:46.950 align:start position:0%
think that that shows substantial um
agreement

02:56:46.950 --> 02:56:46.960 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
02:56:48.309 --> 02:56:48.319 align:start position:0%
that i think that's the conversation
 
02:56:50.230 --> 02:56:50.240 align:start position:0%
between you all and the sponsor and
 
02:57:00.710 --> 02:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:00.720 --> 02:57:02.070 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:57:02.070 --> 02:57:02.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:57:05.190 --> 02:57:05.200 align:start position:0%
i've got your name ted but i don't have

rivers council thank you representative
egan

02:58:02.870 --> 02:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
egan
 
02:58:06.110 --> 02:58:06.120 align:start position:0%
um i have been around since the
 
02:58:09.429 --> 02:58:09.439 align:start position:0%
1980s when the program was envisioned
 
02:58:10.950 --> 02:58:10.960 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire rivers council was
 
02:58:12.790 --> 02:58:12.800 align:start position:0%
once the new hampshire rivers campaign
 
02:58:14.309 --> 02:58:14.319 align:start position:0%
it was a group of citizens and
 
02:58:16.550 --> 02:58:16.560 align:start position:0%
communities that got together and
 
02:58:18.950 --> 02:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
decided that river protection was
 
02:58:21.910 --> 02:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
necessary and so it passed that bill and
 
02:58:23.510 --> 02:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
for those of you who have been around as
 
02:58:25.670 --> 02:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
long as i have you might remember a very
 
02:58:28.790 --> 02:58:28.800 align:start position:0%
conservative person crowe dickinson who
 
02:58:31.030 --> 02:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
was supportive of this bill but one of
 
02:58:32.630 --> 02:58:32.640 align:start position:0%
the things that he wanted to make sure
 
02:58:35.510 --> 02:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
was that everyone would be involved in a
 
02:58:37.750 --> 02:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
designation and so
 
02:58:41.349 --> 02:58:41.359 align:start position:0%
the uh the process included many steps
 
02:58:43.429 --> 02:58:43.439 align:start position:0%
to make sure that all along the way
 
02:58:46.950 --> 02:58:46.960 align:start position:0%
people were involved and i'll speak to
 
02:58:48.630 --> 02:58:48.640 align:start position:0%
chair of the river's management advisory
 
02:58:51.830 --> 02:58:51.840 align:start position:0%
committee in a moment but
 
02:58:53.990 --> 02:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
the study has to go before the rivers
 
02:58:56.309 --> 02:58:56.319 align:start position:0%
management advisory committee and if
 
02:58:58.950 --> 02:58:58.960 align:start position:0%
there is not sufficient support
 
02:59:01.190 --> 02:59:01.200 align:start position:0%
documented in writing
 
02:59:03.710 --> 02:59:03.720 align:start position:0%
a it has to be from all of the
 
02:59:05.910 --> 02:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities but it has to be from
 
02:59:07.429 --> 02:59:07.439 align:start position:0%
others as well
 
02:59:09.429 --> 02:59:09.439 align:start position:0%
then it never gets so far as to be
 
02:59:11.349 --> 02:59:11.359 align:start position:0%
recommended and that's usually where it
 
02:59:13.110 --> 02:59:13.120 align:start position:0%
dies unless there's
 
02:59:14.630 --> 02:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
you know someone who's trying to go
 
02:59:16.870 --> 02:59:16.880 align:start position:0%
around it so i just wanted to mention a
 
02:59:18.710 --> 02:59:18.720 align:start position:0%
couple of points there
 
02:59:20.230 --> 02:59:20.240 align:start position:0%
and that is that
 
02:59:22.550 --> 02:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
that is the reason for the process the
 
02:59:25.429 --> 02:59:25.439 align:start position:0%
rivers council which was the campaign is
 
02:59:27.429 --> 02:59:27.439 align:start position:0%
very concerned about the precedent that
 
02:59:29.910 --> 02:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
this might set and also sort of the
 
02:59:32.790 --> 02:59:32.800 align:start position:0%
black eye on the program and then
 
02:59:34.389 --> 02:59:34.399 align:start position:0%
should the bill pass and there are
 
02:59:36.150 --> 02:59:36.160 align:start position:0%
people who get very upset about it and
 
02:59:37.910 --> 02:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
want to withdraw from the program then
 
02:59:41.269 --> 02:59:41.279 align:start position:0%
the statute will have to be reopened
 
02:59:43.590 --> 02:59:43.600 align:start position:0%
and that brings with it more work for
 
02:59:45.510 --> 02:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
you and a host of other issues that i
 
02:59:47.670 --> 02:59:47.680 align:start position:0%
think none of us want to see
 
02:59:50.230 --> 02:59:50.240 align:start position:0%
no river segment in the entire state has
 
02:59:52.790 --> 02:59:52.800 align:start position:0%
ever bypassed the process
 
02:59:54.550 --> 02:59:54.560 align:start position:0%
and for instance the lamprey river
 
02:59:56.550 --> 02:59:56.560 align:start position:0%
decided it wanted to have a broader
 
02:59:58.790 --> 02:59:58.800 align:start position:0%
reach it went through everything all
 
03:00:00.710 --> 03:00:00.720 align:start position:0%
over again the study the community
 
03:00:02.630 --> 03:00:02.640 align:start position:0%
involvement the reaching out to
 
03:00:04.550 --> 03:00:04.560 align:start position:0%
legislators asking them if they wanted
 
03:00:07.830 --> 03:00:07.840 align:start position:0%
to serve locally this all was
 
03:00:10.309 --> 03:00:10.319 align:start position:0%
completely and utterly the same as they
 
03:00:12.550 --> 03:00:12.560 align:start position:0%
did before so they didn't even try to do
 
03:00:15.349 --> 03:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
anything sort of on the quick even
 
03:00:17.429 --> 03:00:17.439 align:start position:0%
though they already had a designation in
 
03:00:17.439 --> 03:00:18.630 align:start position:0%
though they already had a designation in
place

03:00:18.630 --> 03:00:18.640 align:start position:0%
place
 
03:00:20.950 --> 03:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
so we are incredibly supportive of the
 
03:00:22.469 --> 03:00:22.479 align:start position:0%
idea of
 
03:00:24.070 --> 03:00:24.080 align:start position:0%
having the middle merrimack in the
 
03:00:26.070 --> 03:00:26.080 align:start position:0%
program as long as it does what all the
 
03:00:27.750 --> 03:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
other segments did
 
03:00:29.510 --> 03:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
and to fill in a little bit of that
 
03:00:29.520 --> 03:00:30.630 align:start position:0%
and to fill in a little bit of that
history

03:00:30.630 --> 03:00:30.640 align:start position:0%
history
 
03:00:32.469 --> 03:00:32.479 align:start position:0%
from the hookset line down to the
 
03:00:34.790 --> 03:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
manchester bedford line it was the
 
03:00:36.710 --> 03:00:36.720 align:start position:0%
manchester water works it was the city
 
03:00:39.269 --> 03:00:39.279 align:start position:0%
of manchester it was then the public
 
03:00:41.510 --> 03:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
service company
 
03:00:43.670 --> 03:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
that didn't want to see
 
03:00:46.389 --> 03:00:46.399 align:start position:0%
this designation for their own reasons
 
03:00:49.190 --> 03:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
and so that's why it was not included
 
03:00:49.200 --> 03:00:49.910 align:start position:0%
and so that's why it was not included
and

03:00:49.910 --> 03:00:49.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:00:52.070 --> 03:00:52.080 align:start position:0%
none of those interests i believe are
 
03:00:54.309 --> 03:00:54.319 align:start position:0%
aware of it although we do have the new
 
03:00:56.070 --> 03:00:56.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire water works association here
 
03:00:57.750 --> 03:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
so they're aware of it now
 
03:00:57.760 --> 03:00:58.870 align:start position:0%
so they're aware of it now
and

03:00:58.870 --> 03:00:58.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:01:00.150 --> 03:01:00.160 align:start position:0%
you know i'm
 
03:01:02.389 --> 03:01:02.399 align:start position:0%
surprised that the city of manchester
 
03:01:04.630 --> 03:01:04.640 align:start position:0%
the town of bedford for instance are not
 
03:01:07.110 --> 03:01:07.120 align:start position:0%
here and i think that it's not just
 
03:01:09.590 --> 03:01:09.600 align:start position:0%
about the city or town leaders it's
 
03:01:11.510 --> 03:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
about everyone including the businesses
 
03:01:12.870 --> 03:01:12.880 align:start position:0%
along the way
 
03:01:15.030 --> 03:01:15.040 align:start position:0%
so i would urge that
 
03:01:16.870 --> 03:01:16.880 align:start position:0%
we send a message to representative
 
03:01:19.429 --> 03:01:19.439 align:start position:0%
barry that we're opposing the bill and
 
03:01:21.750 --> 03:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
it's an expedient to legislate but that
 
03:01:23.910 --> 03:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
we'd like to begin working with him the
 
03:01:26.150 --> 03:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
way we have in the satisfying way that
 
03:01:28.630 --> 03:01:28.640 align:start position:0%
we have with the other committees so
 
03:01:30.870 --> 03:01:30.880 align:start position:0%
i'll stop being the new hampshire risk
 
03:01:32.550 --> 03:01:32.560 align:start position:0%
counsel and i can change to a different
 
03:01:34.389 --> 03:01:34.399 align:start position:0%
personality if you don't have any
 
03:01:34.399 --> 03:01:39.990 align:start position:0%
personality if you don't have any
questions

03:01:39.990 --> 03:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:42.230 --> 03:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
any questions by
 
03:01:46.389 --> 03:01:46.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:48.950 --> 03:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
all right very quickly the rivers uh
 
03:01:51.190 --> 03:01:51.200 align:start position:0%
management advisory committee letter is
 
03:01:53.429 --> 03:01:53.439 align:start position:0%
coming around with a fact sheet from the
 
03:01:56.389 --> 03:01:56.399 align:start position:0%
department's website so you can get a
 
03:01:58.870 --> 03:01:58.880 align:start position:0%
sense of how the program works
 
03:02:01.190 --> 03:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
and very briefly what we're looking to
 
03:02:03.269 --> 03:02:03.279 align:start position:0%
talk about there is that
 
03:02:05.910 --> 03:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
it's very important for all of us to be
 
03:02:08.469 --> 03:02:08.479 align:start position:0%
involved in this process the
 
03:02:12.070 --> 03:02:12.080 align:start position:0%
rmac as it is known conducts a public
 
03:02:14.950 --> 03:02:14.960 align:start position:0%
hearing in the communities it conducts a
 
03:02:17.670 --> 03:02:17.680 align:start position:0%
tour that everyone comes on that's
 
03:02:20.150 --> 03:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
interested and that way first hand we
 
03:02:22.630 --> 03:02:22.640 align:start position:0%
have an idea of why the river is special
 
03:02:24.950 --> 03:02:24.960 align:start position:0%
we get to hear from citizens
 
03:02:27.510 --> 03:02:27.520 align:start position:0%
and then if we don't see the support and
 
03:02:30.150 --> 03:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
have it documented in writing then we
 
03:02:32.309 --> 03:02:32.319 align:start position:0%
don't recommend it so i don't want to be
 
03:02:34.550 --> 03:02:34.560 align:start position:0%
repetitious but you do have that letter
 
03:02:36.070 --> 03:02:36.080 align:start position:0%
in that fact sheet
 
03:02:39.030 --> 03:02:39.040 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to answer any questions
 
03:02:41.030 --> 03:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
and i wanted to also give you the
 
03:02:44.150 --> 03:02:44.160 align:start position:0%
connecticut river conservancy's letter
 
03:02:47.190 --> 03:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
in opposition they're highly concerned
 
03:02:49.030 --> 03:02:49.040 align:start position:0%
about the precedent even though they're
 
03:02:50.710 --> 03:02:50.720 align:start position:0%
on what they call new hampshire's west
 
03:02:53.110 --> 03:02:53.120 align:start position:0%
coast they're really concerned about the
 
03:02:53.120 --> 03:02:55.830 align:start position:0%
coast they're really concerned about the
precedent

03:02:55.830 --> 03:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:58.389 --> 03:02:58.399 align:start position:0%
and as a chair of a local advisory
 
03:02:59.670 --> 03:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
committee when
 
03:03:01.990 --> 03:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
the lower merrimack decided that they
 
03:03:03.910 --> 03:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
didn't want to see this happen and be
 
03:03:06.790 --> 03:03:06.800 align:start position:0%
annexed as the term was used
 
03:03:09.670 --> 03:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
they suggested that the upper merrimack
 
03:03:12.389 --> 03:03:12.399 align:start position:0%
be the one to be annexed and we also
 
03:03:14.710 --> 03:03:14.720 align:start position:0%
have plenty of work to do as volunteers
 
03:03:16.309 --> 03:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
and i think that it's important for
 
03:03:18.309 --> 03:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
those communities to form their own
 
03:03:18.319 --> 03:03:19.429 align:start position:0%
those communities to form their own
group

03:03:19.429 --> 03:03:19.439 align:start position:0%
group
 
03:03:22.070 --> 03:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
the nomination committee often becomes
 
03:03:24.550 --> 03:03:24.560 align:start position:0%
the local advisory committee and
 
03:03:27.110 --> 03:03:27.120 align:start position:0%
the communities often just
 
03:03:29.429 --> 03:03:29.439 align:start position:0%
ultimately decide the city of manchester
 
03:03:31.590 --> 03:03:31.600 align:start position:0%
would decide the town of bedford would
 
03:03:33.349 --> 03:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
decide who they want to work on their
 
03:03:33.359 --> 03:03:34.950 align:start position:0%
decide who they want to work on their
committees

03:03:34.950 --> 03:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
committees
 
03:03:36.950 --> 03:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
so sorry about the
 
03:03:39.750 --> 03:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
the trifecta of personalities but i
 
03:03:41.910 --> 03:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
thought the different perspectives might
 
03:03:43.590 --> 03:03:43.600 align:start position:0%
be helpful to you
 
03:03:45.750 --> 03:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
and also that i'm the oldest person in
 
03:03:47.110 --> 03:03:47.120 align:start position:0%
the room at least
 
03:03:53.670 --> 03:03:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:56.309 --> 03:03:56.319 align:start position:0%
still let you know both cards
 
03:03:57.750 --> 03:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
are in the record
 
03:04:02.630 --> 03:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:05.030 --> 03:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
is uh any uh
 
03:04:12.630 --> 03:04:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:14.389 --> 03:04:14.399 align:start position:0%
the oldest person in the room doesn't
 
03:04:16.550 --> 03:04:16.560 align:start position:0%
get any questions are you taking pity on
 
03:04:18.070 --> 03:04:18.080 align:start position:0%
me oh
 
03:04:19.910 --> 03:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
you're certainly not the oldest person
 
03:04:24.230 --> 03:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:25.429 --> 03:04:25.439 align:start position:0%
oh no
 
03:04:28.309 --> 03:04:28.319 align:start position:0%
i i know i have i have shoes older than
 
03:04:28.319 --> 03:04:29.670 align:start position:0%
i i know i have i have shoes older than
you

03:04:29.670 --> 03:04:29.680 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:04:31.429 --> 03:04:31.439 align:start position:0%
i mean believe me
 
03:04:34.389 --> 03:04:34.399 align:start position:0%
well we'll talk after the hearing
 
03:04:36.550 --> 03:04:36.560 align:start position:0%
um thank you all very much for your time
 
03:04:38.790 --> 03:04:38.800 align:start position:0%
i really appreciate it and i hope that
 
03:04:40.790 --> 03:04:40.800 align:start position:0%
we can um
 
03:04:42.870 --> 03:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
have this bill be inexpedient to
 
03:04:45.110 --> 03:04:45.120 align:start position:0%
legislate but also that we send a strong
 
03:04:47.190 --> 03:04:47.200 align:start position:0%
message to representative barry that
 
03:04:49.670 --> 03:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
river conservation is wonderful we are
 
03:04:51.910 --> 03:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
grateful and look forward to working
 
03:04:53.190 --> 03:04:53.200 align:start position:0%
with him
 
03:04:55.030 --> 03:04:55.040 align:start position:0%
on the process i think he'll find it
 
03:04:56.790 --> 03:04:56.800 align:start position:0%
rewarding and the results certainly
 
03:04:56.800 --> 03:04:57.830 align:start position:0%
rewarding and the results certainly
stick

03:04:57.830 --> 03:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
stick
 
03:05:00.710 --> 03:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:00.720 --> 03:05:02.030 align:start position:0%
 
thank

03:05:02.030 --> 03:05:02.040 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:05:12.550 --> 03:05:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:14.469 --> 03:05:14.479 align:start position:0%
from the new hampshire water works
 
03:05:14.479 --> 03:05:17.030 align:start position:0%
from the new hampshire water works
association

03:05:17.030 --> 03:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
association
 
03:05:19.510 --> 03:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
yes sir thank you chair and uh i'm
 
03:05:22.309 --> 03:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
appreciative that you uh recognize the
 
03:05:23.910 --> 03:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
acronym there it's
 
03:05:26.710 --> 03:05:26.720 align:start position:0%
a good sign um i do have copies of uh
 
03:05:28.630 --> 03:05:28.640 align:start position:0%
written testimony i sent it in advance
 
03:05:30.950 --> 03:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
should i send that around one pager for
 
03:05:32.710 --> 03:05:32.720 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:05:36.550 --> 03:05:36.560 align:start position:0%
i hate to ask you because all right
 
03:05:38.950 --> 03:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
if you do how many do you have 20 20 or
 
03:05:41.190 --> 03:05:41.200 align:start position:0%
21 should have enough yeah if
 
03:05:45.349 --> 03:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:47.510 --> 03:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
um a lot of what i was going to say has
 
03:05:49.670 --> 03:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
been touched on again for the record my
 
03:05:51.670 --> 03:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
name is boyd smith i'm the president and
 
03:05:53.429 --> 03:05:53.439 align:start position:0%
ceo of the new hampshire water works
 
03:05:53.439 --> 03:05:55.429 align:start position:0%
ceo of the new hampshire water works
association

03:05:55.429 --> 03:05:55.439 align:start position:0%
association
 
03:05:58.389 --> 03:05:58.399 align:start position:0%
and uh we represent the drinking water
 
03:06:00.389 --> 03:06:00.399 align:start position:0%
sector in the state of new hampshire
 
03:06:03.349 --> 03:06:03.359 align:start position:0%
that serves roughly 54 of our people
 
03:06:03.359 --> 03:06:04.309 align:start position:0%
that serves roughly 54 of our people
with

03:06:04.309 --> 03:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:06:06.469 --> 03:06:06.479 align:start position:0%
safe clean and affordable drinking water
 
03:06:08.230 --> 03:06:08.240 align:start position:0%
one of the biggest sources of drinking
 
03:06:09.910 --> 03:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
water for the biggest systems is the
 
03:06:11.590 --> 03:06:11.600 align:start position:0%
merrimack river
 
03:06:14.469 --> 03:06:14.479 align:start position:0%
surface water is is you know what feeds
 
03:06:17.349 --> 03:06:17.359 align:start position:0%
manchester and benechuck of course and
 
03:06:18.870 --> 03:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
and other systems
 
03:06:20.790 --> 03:06:20.800 align:start position:0%
so uh that's really one of the drivers
 
03:06:24.389 --> 03:06:24.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:24.399 --> 03:06:25.910 align:start position:0%
 
the

03:06:25.910 --> 03:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:06:28.309 --> 03:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
the merrimack as we know is being used
 
03:06:30.309 --> 03:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
and as some of you may know is uh the
 
03:06:31.910 --> 03:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
city of manchester is putting in a new
 
03:06:34.630 --> 03:06:34.640 align:start position:0%
treatment plant to expand their capacity
 
03:06:36.950 --> 03:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
another seven million gallons a day
 
03:06:38.469 --> 03:06:38.479 align:start position:0%
i think we can all expect that our
 
03:06:41.030 --> 03:06:41.040 align:start position:0%
surface water will continue to be
 
03:06:44.150 --> 03:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
used into the future our needs are just
 
03:06:46.469 --> 03:06:46.479 align:start position:0%
likely going to grow so taking care of
 
03:06:49.670 --> 03:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
our resources is our source waters is a
 
03:06:51.750 --> 03:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
top priority for the sector as i'm sure
 
03:06:54.830 --> 03:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:58.870 --> 03:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
um so our group is uh i like to just
 
03:07:01.269 --> 03:07:01.279 align:start position:0%
remind folks that they're um
 
03:07:04.070 --> 03:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
they're they're public servants and they
 
03:07:05.830 --> 03:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
think of themselves and i'm new to this
 
03:07:08.150 --> 03:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
group but i've heard numerous people say
 
03:07:09.830 --> 03:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
uh we're health providers we're in it
 
03:07:12.389 --> 03:07:12.399 align:start position:0%
for public health uh our product people
 
03:07:14.070 --> 03:07:14.080 align:start position:0%
drink our product and i'm just saying
 
03:07:17.030 --> 03:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
this because i want to uh reinforce the
 
03:07:19.030 --> 03:07:19.040 align:start position:0%
nature of the somewhat hidden social
 
03:07:21.510 --> 03:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
service that we all depend on uh there's
 
03:07:23.830 --> 03:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
a good bunch of people
 
03:07:25.510 --> 03:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
they'll follow they want to follow
 
03:07:27.510 --> 03:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
science and regulations and well thought
 
03:07:29.670 --> 03:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
out policy because
 
03:07:31.349 --> 03:07:31.359 align:start position:0%
they want to implement it well and of
 
03:07:34.309 --> 03:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
course policy decisions have
 
03:07:37.030 --> 03:07:37.040 align:start position:0%
implications cost implica cost
 
03:07:39.110 --> 03:07:39.120 align:start position:0%
implications and others
 
03:07:41.990 --> 03:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
so the bottom line we did oppose the
 
03:07:44.389 --> 03:07:44.399 align:start position:0%
bill and there may be some amendments
 
03:07:46.070 --> 03:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
around that we haven't seen yet that may
 
03:07:47.190 --> 03:07:47.200 align:start position:0%
change this
 
03:07:47.200 --> 03:07:48.070 align:start position:0%
change this
but

03:07:48.070 --> 03:07:48.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:07:49.990 --> 03:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
the reason we oppose it is because we
 
03:07:51.670 --> 03:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
believe we should use the existing
 
03:07:53.910 --> 03:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
process that's been discussed most
 
03:07:57.750 --> 03:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
thoroughly uh by by ms tremblay
 
03:07:59.830 --> 03:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
under the existing rsa
 
03:07:59.840 --> 03:08:00.630 align:start position:0%
under the existing rsa
to

03:08:00.630 --> 03:08:00.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:08:02.469 --> 03:08:02.479 align:start position:0%
to get the buy-in and the group
 
03:08:05.349 --> 03:08:05.359 align:start position:0%
understanding to make a decisions about
 
03:08:07.990 --> 03:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
future water use these these rivers are
 
03:08:09.510 --> 03:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
surface water bodies they're shared
 
03:08:11.510 --> 03:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
bodies of water they're public water
 
03:08:14.070 --> 03:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
bodies and we drink them we water our
 
03:08:15.590 --> 03:08:15.600 align:start position:0%
lawns with them we look at them we
 
03:08:17.590 --> 03:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
recreate on them
 
03:08:19.670 --> 03:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
so i think it's really important to have
 
03:08:21.910 --> 03:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
this two or three year process
 
03:08:24.150 --> 03:08:24.160 align:start position:0%
to make a well-informed decision about
 
03:08:25.990 --> 03:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
something as important as the merrimack
 
03:08:27.910 --> 03:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
river and certainly from a drinking
 
03:08:29.990 --> 03:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
water standpoint seems like the way to
 
03:08:32.630 --> 03:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
go 19 of 19 are the numbers i heard
 
03:08:34.630 --> 03:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
that's a pretty good track record
 
03:08:37.750 --> 03:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
um you know with my past experience in
 
03:08:41.590 --> 03:08:41.600 align:start position:0%
non-profits uh i've i've learned that
 
03:08:43.110 --> 03:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
when you get people involved then you've
 
03:08:45.510 --> 03:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
got something that sticks so
 
03:08:47.429 --> 03:08:47.439 align:start position:0%
a policy group can make a decision and
 
03:08:49.429 --> 03:08:49.439 align:start position:0%
we can make a decree and
 
03:08:51.590 --> 03:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
there you have it but if you want
 
03:08:54.070 --> 03:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
long-term sustainability and stewardship
 
03:08:55.910 --> 03:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
and citizen engagement
 
03:08:57.830 --> 03:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
you start at the grassroots level and it
 
03:08:59.429 --> 03:08:59.439 align:start position:0%
sounds like building up these advisory
 
03:09:01.510 --> 03:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
committees and the community committees
 
03:09:03.750 --> 03:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
the hearings and the involvement will
 
03:09:05.110 --> 03:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
both inform
 
03:09:07.750 --> 03:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
a sound policy but it also builds the
 
03:09:09.429 --> 03:09:09.439 align:start position:0%
foundation of your leaders of folks to
 
03:09:11.269 --> 03:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
help implement that at all parts of the
 
03:09:13.030 --> 03:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
community moving forward
 
03:09:15.910 --> 03:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
so um i very do much agree with
 
03:09:19.190 --> 03:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
representative berry's intent uh i that
 
03:09:21.269 --> 03:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
rang about me right out of the gate i
 
03:09:22.950 --> 03:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
just think we should use the existing
 
03:09:22.960 --> 03:09:24.309 align:start position:0%
just think we should use the existing
process

03:09:24.309 --> 03:09:24.319 align:start position:0%
process
 
03:09:27.190 --> 03:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
and i believe it's under rsa 483
 
03:09:30.550 --> 03:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
and the the process is under the colon
 
03:09:32.870 --> 03:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
six section let's use that and let's put
 
03:09:34.150 --> 03:09:34.160 align:start position:0%

i was approached by john and terry
 
04:11:30.630 --> 04:11:30.640 align:start position:0%

i

04:11:56.309 --> 04:11:56.319 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:11:58.710 --> 04:11:58.720 align:start position:0%
when i was first approached by this my
 
04:12:01.590 --> 04:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
tenure here has always been in public
 
04:12:03.269 --> 04:12:03.279 align:start position:0%
works and highways
 
04:12:05.030 --> 04:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
and when someone comes forward and
 
04:12:07.110 --> 04:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
proposes a dam
 
04:12:08.469 --> 04:12:08.479 align:start position:0%
to me i
 
04:12:10.870 --> 04:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
am not the most responsive person
 
04:12:10.880 --> 04:12:12.790 align:start position:0%
am not the most responsive person
knowing

04:12:12.790 --> 04:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
knowing
 
04:12:14.710 --> 04:12:14.720 align:start position:0%
what it's costing us now and how we're
 
04:12:18.389 --> 04:12:18.399 align:start position:0%
not able to maintain what it is we have
 
04:12:22.229 --> 04:12:22.239 align:start position:0%
as we got into this conversation further
 
04:12:22.239 --> 04:12:23.590 align:start position:0%
as we got into this conversation further
i

04:12:23.590 --> 04:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:12:25.590 --> 04:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
started to become very comfortable with
 
04:12:27.510 --> 04:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
this proposal
 
04:12:29.910 --> 04:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
because it's a very small structure
 
04:12:32.630 --> 04:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
number one that they're proposing
 
04:12:34.149 --> 04:12:34.159 align:start position:0%
there are some pictures in one of your
 
04:12:36.309 --> 04:12:36.319 align:start position:0%
handouts that was sent to you
 
04:12:39.349 --> 04:12:39.359 align:start position:0%
of what this structure would look like a
 
04:12:41.830 --> 04:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
number of boards being put in
 
04:12:44.550 --> 04:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
and taken out each year that would
 
04:12:44.560 --> 04:12:45.429 align:start position:0%
and taken out each year that would
would

04:12:45.429 --> 04:12:45.439 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:12:45.439 --> 04:12:47.030 align:start position:0%
would
stabilize

04:12:47.030 --> 04:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
stabilize
 
04:12:49.750 --> 04:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
the pond up above
 
04:12:49.760 --> 04:12:51.110 align:start position:0%
the pond up above
the

04:12:51.110 --> 04:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:12:53.910 --> 04:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
it was what also made me eager to be
 
04:12:53.920 --> 04:12:55.750 align:start position:0%
it was what also made me eager to be
here

04:12:55.750 --> 04:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:12:57.269 --> 04:12:57.279 align:start position:0%
was that the
 
04:12:59.429 --> 04:12:59.439 align:start position:0%
cost of this project whether it be the
 
04:13:01.429 --> 04:13:01.439 align:start position:0%
construction the maintenance of this
 
04:13:03.349 --> 04:13:03.359 align:start position:0%
project going forward
 
04:13:05.990 --> 04:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
the cost to put boards in and out would
 
04:13:07.429 --> 04:13:07.439 align:start position:0%
be borne by
 
04:13:08.950 --> 04:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
the idlewice
 
04:13:11.030 --> 04:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
board of commissioners i guess their
 
04:13:11.040 --> 04:13:13.269 align:start position:0%
board of commissioners i guess their
commissioners

04:13:13.269 --> 04:13:13.279 align:start position:0%
commissioners
 
04:13:16.149 --> 04:13:16.159 align:start position:0%
and probably should explain that idawise
 
04:13:18.229 --> 04:13:18.239 align:start position:0%
is a village district
 
04:13:21.189 --> 04:13:21.199 align:start position:0%
in the town of madison
 
04:13:24.229 --> 04:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
it has three water bodies in this
 
04:13:27.510 --> 04:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
subdivision it's an old subdivision
 
04:13:29.670 --> 04:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
from the 70s
 
04:13:31.670 --> 04:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
and there are pictures and so forth
 
04:13:33.269 --> 04:13:33.279 align:start position:0%
showing here
 
04:13:33.279 --> 04:13:34.550 align:start position:0%
showing here
there

04:13:34.550 --> 04:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:13:37.110 --> 04:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
so cost was not an issue for me so as i
 
04:13:39.189 --> 04:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
said that started making me more
 
04:13:39.199 --> 04:13:40.469 align:start position:0%
said that started making me more
comfortable

04:13:40.469 --> 04:13:40.479 align:start position:0%
comfortable
 
04:13:43.349 --> 04:13:43.359 align:start position:0%
and things were moving along swimmingly
 
04:13:44.950 --> 04:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
to say
 
04:13:47.750 --> 04:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
the board of directors had a at a
 
04:13:47.760 --> 04:13:49.110 align:start position:0%
the board of directors had a at a
meeting

04:13:49.110 --> 04:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
04:13:51.910 --> 04:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
were in favor of this proposal
 
04:13:53.670 --> 04:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
and then
 
04:13:56.950 --> 04:13:56.960 align:start position:0%
then all of a sudden uh there was a uh
 
04:13:59.830 --> 04:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
letter uh that's mentioned in here in
 
04:14:01.830 --> 04:14:01.840 align:start position:0%
the local paper
 
04:14:05.030 --> 04:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
that uh stirred up uh some controversy
 
04:14:06.469 --> 04:14:06.479 align:start position:0%
over this
 
04:14:10.950 --> 04:14:10.960 align:start position:0%
and um opposition began to rise
 
04:14:12.790 --> 04:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
and um when
 
04:14:15.590 --> 04:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
as late as this morning
 
04:14:18.550 --> 04:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
i had a conversation with
 
04:14:22.870 --> 04:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
the chairman of the commissioners
 
04:14:25.830 --> 04:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
and uh who had reached a had an
 
04:14:25.840 --> 04:14:27.110 align:start position:0%
and uh who had reached a had an
agreement

04:14:27.110 --> 04:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
04:14:30.710 --> 04:14:30.720 align:start position:0%
to uh to send to you in favor of this
 
04:14:30.720 --> 04:14:32.630 align:start position:0%
to uh to send to you in favor of this
proposal

04:14:32.630 --> 04:14:32.640 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
04:14:34.630 --> 04:14:34.640 align:start position:0%
but decided that they wanted to wait
 
04:14:36.790 --> 04:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
until today's meeting before they sign
 
04:14:39.670 --> 04:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
it that'd be jay buckley
 
04:14:41.429 --> 04:14:41.439 align:start position:0%
and they're hoping that they're going to
 
04:14:44.550 --> 04:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
feel good about this proposal once again
 
04:14:46.070 --> 04:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
and they're starting to hear more in
 
04:14:48.830 --> 04:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
favor than opposed to where they were
 
04:14:51.910 --> 04:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
so people will be speaking behind me i
 
04:14:53.830 --> 04:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
see jim here from the dam bureau and
 
04:14:56.309 --> 04:14:56.319 align:start position:0%
others there's a letter from
 
04:14:58.550 --> 04:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner scott from des in the
 
04:14:58.560 --> 04:14:59.510 align:start position:0%
commissioner scott from des in the
packet

04:14:59.510 --> 04:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
packet
 
04:15:01.429 --> 04:15:01.439 align:start position:0%
that speaks of
 
04:15:05.030 --> 04:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
his favor of this project
 
04:15:05.040 --> 04:15:06.309 align:start position:0%
his favor of this project
and

04:15:06.309 --> 04:15:06.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:15:08.149 --> 04:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
i just the last thing i'd like to add
 
04:15:09.990 --> 04:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
before it's turned over
 
04:15:12.550 --> 04:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
is i i needed to see buy in from all of
 
04:15:14.950 --> 04:15:14.960 align:start position:0%
the parties before i brought this
 
04:15:19.670 --> 04:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
forward and fish and games position
 
04:15:21.269 --> 04:15:21.279 align:start position:0%
was that
 
04:15:23.269 --> 04:15:23.279 align:start position:0%
go ahead and get the proposal going and
 
04:15:25.590 --> 04:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
if the dam bureau and idawise and others
 
04:15:28.070 --> 04:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
were in favor of it they'd be happy to
 
04:15:30.469 --> 04:15:30.479 align:start position:0%
work with the parties going forward to
 
04:15:32.389 --> 04:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
make sure
 
04:15:34.790 --> 04:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
what's being proposed is good for the
 
04:15:34.800 --> 04:15:35.910 align:start position:0%
what's being proposed is good for the
environment

04:15:35.910 --> 04:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
environment
 
04:15:37.990 --> 04:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
would meet their favor
 
04:15:38.000 --> 04:15:39.269 align:start position:0%
would meet their favor
so

04:15:39.269 --> 04:15:39.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:15:40.950 --> 04:15:40.960 align:start position:0%
with that
 
04:15:43.990 --> 04:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
i think i will conclude my testimony and
 
04:15:46.790 --> 04:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
allow you to have the opportunity
 
04:15:49.349 --> 04:15:49.359 align:start position:0%
to speak with others that have more
 
04:15:49.359 --> 04:16:01.110 align:start position:0%
to speak with others that have more
knowledge

04:16:01.110 --> 04:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:02.950 --> 04:16:02.960 align:start position:0%
thank you is uh
 
04:16:04.630 --> 04:16:04.640 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
04:16:04.640 --> 04:16:05.670 align:start position:0%
any questions
for

04:16:05.670 --> 04:16:05.680 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:16:10.870 --> 04:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:13.510 --> 04:16:13.520 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
04:16:16.229 --> 04:16:16.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:24.229 --> 04:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:25.429 --> 04:16:25.439 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:16:27.670 --> 04:16:27.680 align:start position:0%
i'm going to call
 
04:16:27.680 --> 04:16:28.950 align:start position:0%
i'm going to call
steve

04:16:28.950 --> 04:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
steve
 
04:16:31.269 --> 04:16:31.279 align:start position:0%
doyon from the new hampshire department
 
04:16:36.870 --> 04:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:38.389 --> 04:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chairman and members
 
04:16:40.070 --> 04:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
04:16:42.229 --> 04:16:42.239 align:start position:0%
my name is steve doyle and i'm with des
 
04:16:43.750 --> 04:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
i manage the
 
04:16:45.670 --> 04:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
damn safety and inspection program for
 
04:16:47.670 --> 04:16:47.680 align:start position:0%
mr gallagher who's also with me today
 
04:16:50.070 --> 04:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
okay uh you have our letter of testimony
 
04:16:51.670 --> 04:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
i'm going to summarize a few points so i
 
04:16:53.429 --> 04:16:53.439 align:start position:0%
have additional letters of testimony if
 
04:16:55.590 --> 04:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
you need them does anybody need any any
 
04:16:59.189 --> 04:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:03.269 --> 04:17:03.279 align:start position:0%
we do have copies that okay very good
 
04:17:05.030 --> 04:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
anybody hear me okay
 
04:17:05.040 --> 04:17:07.110 align:start position:0%
anybody hear me okay
okay

04:17:07.110 --> 04:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:17:09.030 --> 04:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
i wanted to start by summarizing the
 
04:17:10.389 --> 04:17:10.399 align:start position:0%
figure that was included with the letter
 
04:17:11.910 --> 04:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
of testimony i think it's fairly
 
04:17:13.189 --> 04:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
straightforward but you can see the
 
04:17:14.790 --> 04:17:14.800 align:start position:0%
three pawns here
 
04:17:16.950 --> 04:17:16.960 align:start position:0%
just wanted to indicate that um
 
04:17:18.550 --> 04:17:18.560 align:start position:0%
obviously big p
 
04:17:20.070 --> 04:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
is to the uh to the east in the
 
04:17:22.149 --> 04:17:22.159 align:start position:0%
photograph the largest water body and
 
04:17:24.550 --> 04:17:24.560 align:start position:0%
the dam is to be constructed somewhere
 
04:17:26.790 --> 04:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
very close to where the big pond outlets
 
04:17:28.469 --> 04:17:28.479 align:start position:0%
into that stream channel that extends
 
04:17:32.229 --> 04:17:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:33.990 --> 04:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
middle p and little p are controlled by
 
04:17:35.830 --> 04:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
a single dam that is at the outlet of
 
04:17:35.840 --> 04:17:36.830 align:start position:0%
a single dam that is at the outlet of
little

04:17:36.830 --> 04:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
little
 
04:17:39.590 --> 04:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
p um that that comes into play because
 
04:17:41.189 --> 04:17:41.199 align:start position:0%
management occurs there that can affect
 
04:17:43.269 --> 04:17:43.279 align:start position:0%
big p under certain conditions
 
04:17:44.950 --> 04:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
uh that stream channel that connects
 
04:17:46.950 --> 04:17:46.960 align:start position:0%
middle p to big p
 
04:17:50.229 --> 04:17:50.239 align:start position:0%
uh does have some gradient in it so
 
04:17:52.710 --> 04:17:52.720 align:start position:0%
to summarize then
 
04:17:52.720 --> 04:17:56.309 align:start position:0%
to summarize then
um

04:17:56.309 --> 04:17:56.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:58.790 --> 04:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
the the dam at little p is also owned by
 
04:18:00.710 --> 04:18:00.720 align:start position:0%
the uh the um
 
04:18:03.349 --> 04:18:03.359 align:start position:0%
village district that idolized also just
 
04:18:05.429 --> 04:18:05.439 align:start position:0%
if you didn't weren't aware of that
 
04:18:08.309 --> 04:18:08.319 align:start position:0%
so as far as operations of the dam at
 
04:18:11.189 --> 04:18:11.199 align:start position:0%
the outlet of little p
 
04:18:12.950 --> 04:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
in dry conditions
 
04:18:15.429 --> 04:18:15.439 align:start position:0%
or during dry down conditions
 
04:18:15.439 --> 04:18:16.550 align:start position:0%
or during dry down conditions
the

04:18:16.550 --> 04:18:16.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:18:17.670 --> 04:18:17.680 align:start position:0%
the gradient of the channel that
 
04:18:20.309 --> 04:18:20.319 align:start position:0%
connects big p to middle p increases
 
04:18:22.389 --> 04:18:22.399 align:start position:0%
which accelerates the discharge of water
 
04:18:23.590 --> 04:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
out of big p
 
04:18:24.870 --> 04:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
so i think during the drought conditions
 
04:18:26.309 --> 04:18:26.319 align:start position:0%
that we've seen and under these
 
04:18:27.910 --> 04:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
operations that can be conducted
 
04:18:27.920 --> 04:18:29.750 align:start position:0%
operations that can be conducted
downstream

04:18:29.750 --> 04:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
downstream
 
04:18:31.910 --> 04:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
there are the possibilities that big p
 
04:18:34.070 --> 04:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
can drain prematurely in the summertime
 
04:18:35.429 --> 04:18:35.439 align:start position:0%
you have spring flows that keep the
 
04:18:36.790 --> 04:18:36.800 align:start position:0%
water up for a while and then over the
 
04:18:38.550 --> 04:18:38.560 align:start position:0%
course of the dry summer
 
04:18:41.990 --> 04:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
levels ebb so our understanding is that
 
04:18:44.229 --> 04:18:44.239 align:start position:0%
the association wants to construct a
 
04:18:45.750 --> 04:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
very small dam at the outlet of big
 
04:18:48.149 --> 04:18:48.159 align:start position:0%
piece so that during those times not
 
04:18:49.670 --> 04:18:49.680 align:start position:0%
only are they able to stabilize the
 
04:18:52.309 --> 04:18:52.319 align:start position:0%
level of big p uh to
 
04:18:55.110 --> 04:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
some elevation that we're not uh we know
 
04:18:56.309 --> 04:18:56.319 align:start position:0%
we're not aware of that right now we
 
04:18:58.550 --> 04:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
don't have a formal operating plan to
 
04:19:00.309 --> 04:19:00.319 align:start position:0%
evaluate but we hope to get one so that
 
04:19:02.790 --> 04:19:02.800 align:start position:0%
we can look at that but that and that
 
04:19:04.389 --> 04:19:04.399 align:start position:0%
intent then is to make make sure that
 
04:19:07.590 --> 04:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
they can keep a stable water level
 
04:19:09.429 --> 04:19:09.439 align:start position:0%
uh the department well myself in
 
04:19:11.910 --> 04:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
particular i've spoken to the folks who
 
04:19:13.510 --> 04:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
are interested in building the sam john
 
04:19:14.710 --> 04:19:14.720 align:start position:0%
and his wife
 
04:19:16.790 --> 04:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
and we've imparted that
 
04:19:18.710 --> 04:19:18.720 align:start position:0%
the most the least impact structure
 
04:19:19.750 --> 04:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
would be
 
04:19:21.990 --> 04:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
uh one that has a sill at the current
 
04:19:24.389 --> 04:19:24.399 align:start position:0%
invert of the outlet brook
 
04:19:27.030 --> 04:19:27.040 align:start position:0%
and stop log abutments at the ends of
 
04:19:28.550 --> 04:19:28.560 align:start position:0%
the current width of the channel that
 
04:19:30.790 --> 04:19:30.800 align:start position:0%
way there to maintain a higher water
 
04:19:32.950 --> 04:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
level or stabilized water level all they
 
04:19:34.790 --> 04:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
would need to do would be to put logs in
 
04:19:37.590 --> 04:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
between those two concrete abutments
 
04:19:38.950 --> 04:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
if for some reason they needed to
 
04:19:40.710 --> 04:19:40.720 align:start position:0%
operate the dam for example during high
 
04:19:42.630 --> 04:19:42.640 align:start position:0%
inflows they could remove all of the
 
04:19:44.389 --> 04:19:44.399 align:start position:0%
logs and it would be just like returning
 
04:19:45.910 --> 04:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
the outlet stream to its natural
 
04:19:47.670 --> 04:19:47.680 align:start position:0%
condition there would be no impediments
 
04:19:48.630 --> 04:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
in the brooks so that is our
 
04:19:50.389 --> 04:19:50.399 align:start position:0%
recommendation for a structure and they
 
04:19:51.670 --> 04:19:51.680 align:start position:0%
seem to be on board with that so that's
 
04:19:53.670 --> 04:19:53.680 align:start position:0%
a good idea
 
04:19:55.429 --> 04:19:55.439 align:start position:0%
it also allows them
 
04:19:55.439 --> 04:19:56.630 align:start position:0%
it also allows them
to

04:19:56.630 --> 04:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:19:58.870 --> 04:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
in the fall conduct a drawdown so for
 
04:20:00.950 --> 04:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
example if they determined if the
 
04:20:02.950 --> 04:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
management plan that is ultimately
 
04:20:05.030 --> 04:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
accepted causes the lake to rise a foot
 
04:20:06.550 --> 04:20:06.560 align:start position:0%
for example
 
04:20:08.229 --> 04:20:08.239 align:start position:0%
they have the ability in the fall so
 
04:20:09.750 --> 04:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
they put it they would put in logs to
 
04:20:11.349 --> 04:20:11.359 align:start position:0%
manage it to that level in the fall they
 
04:20:13.750 --> 04:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
would take those logs out perhaps and
 
04:20:15.429 --> 04:20:15.439 align:start position:0%
over the course of the winter the it
 
04:20:17.830 --> 04:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
would be a natural stream again and then
 
04:20:19.110 --> 04:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
it comes springtime they would put the
 
04:20:21.030 --> 04:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
logs back in to achieve their summer
 
04:20:22.630 --> 04:20:22.640 align:start position:0%
recreational pool
 
04:20:24.149 --> 04:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
that is more beneficial than having a
 
04:20:26.229 --> 04:20:26.239 align:start position:0%
permanent sill in the outlet brook
 
04:20:27.510 --> 04:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
because that would be a permanent
 
04:20:27.520 --> 04:20:35.030 align:start position:0%
because that would be a permanent
impediment

04:20:35.030 --> 04:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:37.990 --> 04:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh an indication here in the letter uh
 
04:20:39.110 --> 04:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
certainly there are other permits
 
04:20:40.710 --> 04:20:40.720 align:start position:0%
involved here
 
04:20:42.870 --> 04:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
the uh the dam would have to be approved
 
04:20:44.469 --> 04:20:44.479 align:start position:0%
by the dam bureau there would have to be
 
04:20:47.269 --> 04:20:47.279 align:start position:0%
a wetlands permit obviously in response
 
04:20:49.110 --> 04:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
to an approval from the legislature to
 
04:20:50.710 --> 04:20:50.720 align:start position:0%
have that happen
 
04:20:52.309 --> 04:20:52.319 align:start position:0%
so there are many questions maybe that
 
04:20:54.070 --> 04:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
still exists that would come out during
 
04:20:55.429 --> 04:20:55.439 align:start position:0%
those permit
 
04:20:57.269 --> 04:20:57.279 align:start position:0%
application processes perhaps for
 
04:20:59.349 --> 04:20:59.359 align:start position:0%
wetlands which i think is also going to
 
04:21:00.870 --> 04:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
consider issues that
 
04:21:04.229 --> 04:21:04.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:05.510 --> 04:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
and i did want to bring up a couple of
 
04:21:06.870 --> 04:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
points that may not be in the letter
 
04:21:06.880 --> 04:21:11.269 align:start position:0%
points that may not be in the letter
also

04:21:11.269 --> 04:21:11.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:13.429 --> 04:21:13.439 align:start position:0%
big pea porridge pond is a public water
 
04:21:15.189 --> 04:21:15.199 align:start position:0%
body that is it's a
 
04:21:17.110 --> 04:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
water body that is greater than 10 acres
 
04:21:19.910 --> 04:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
in its natural state
 
04:21:21.590 --> 04:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
so the state
 
04:21:23.990 --> 04:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
holds a public trust interest in big
 
04:21:24.000 --> 04:21:25.590 align:start position:0%
holds a public trust interest in big
people

04:21:25.590 --> 04:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:21:27.269 --> 04:21:27.279 align:start position:0%
we haven't yet seen a final management
 
04:21:28.550 --> 04:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
plan for
 
04:21:28.560 --> 04:21:29.349 align:start position:0%
plan for
what

04:21:29.349 --> 04:21:29.359 align:start position:0%
what
 
04:21:31.349 --> 04:21:31.359 align:start position:0%
the associated association wants to do
 
04:21:34.229 --> 04:21:34.239 align:start position:0%
at the level but certainly
 
04:21:35.670 --> 04:21:35.680 align:start position:0%
those public trust rights could come
 
04:21:36.950 --> 04:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
into play so we would just have to
 
04:21:39.030 --> 04:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
evaluate and ensure that if maintaining
 
04:21:41.510 --> 04:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
a stable water elevation restores the
 
04:21:43.429 --> 04:21:43.439 align:start position:0%
pawn to the natural mean high water mark
 
04:21:44.870 --> 04:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
which is the limit of states public
 
04:21:47.189 --> 04:21:47.199 align:start position:0%
trust interest should be no problem
 
04:21:49.030 --> 04:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
however if the association is interested
 
04:21:51.349 --> 04:21:51.359 align:start position:0%
in raising the level higher than that
 
04:21:51.359 --> 04:21:52.389 align:start position:0%
in raising the level higher than that
perhaps

04:21:52.389 --> 04:21:52.399 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
04:21:54.870 --> 04:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
then there comes an issue with uh
 
04:21:56.469 --> 04:21:56.479 align:start position:0%
perhaps gaining water rights from
 
04:21:57.910 --> 04:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
everybody who lives around the pond
 
04:21:59.590 --> 04:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
which could be a daunting task not
 
04:22:01.269 --> 04:22:01.279 align:start position:0%
impossible but it could be a difficult
 
04:22:06.550 --> 04:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:08.550 --> 04:22:08.560 align:start position:0%
and the only other comment that i would
 
04:22:08.560 --> 04:22:09.349 align:start position:0%
and the only other comment that i would
have

04:22:09.349 --> 04:22:09.359 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:22:10.950 --> 04:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
would be relative to the wording of the
 
04:22:13.750 --> 04:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
legislation several years ago a similar
 
04:22:15.750 --> 04:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
occurrence occurred at janus pond in
 
04:22:15.760 --> 04:22:17.189 align:start position:0%
occurrence occurred at janus pond in
northwood

04:22:17.189 --> 04:22:17.199 align:start position:0%
northwood
 
04:22:18.550 --> 04:22:18.560 align:start position:0%
and the the
 
04:22:21.110 --> 04:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
statute was written such that it said to
 
04:22:23.510 --> 04:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
maintain a stable water elevation for
 
04:22:24.870 --> 04:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
janus pond
 
04:22:26.710 --> 04:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
but they also constructed their dam with
 
04:22:28.149 --> 04:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
stop logs in it so that they could have
 
04:22:29.510 --> 04:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
a drawdown
 
04:22:32.149 --> 04:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
but because the legislation did not say
 
04:22:34.149 --> 04:22:34.159 align:start position:0%
what because the legislation did say to
 
04:22:36.550 --> 04:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
maintain a stable water level
 
04:22:38.149 --> 04:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
i believe that organization had to come
 
04:22:40.870 --> 04:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
back to the legislature to get the
 
04:22:42.469 --> 04:22:42.479 align:start position:0%
wording amended so that they could have
 
04:22:45.269 --> 04:22:45.279 align:start position:0%
a drawdown so i would just caution
 
04:22:47.750 --> 04:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
those interest parties to make to take a
 
04:22:49.349 --> 04:22:49.359 align:start position:0%
look at that to ensure that
 
04:22:51.110 --> 04:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
you know their the wording of the
 
04:22:52.630 --> 04:22:52.640 align:start position:0%
legislation is such that it allows them
 
04:22:57.750 --> 04:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:05.830 --> 04:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:07.830 --> 04:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
any questions by members of the
 
04:23:07.840 --> 04:23:09.750 align:start position:0%
any questions by members of the
committee

04:23:09.750 --> 04:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:23:11.349 --> 04:23:11.359 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
04:23:13.590 --> 04:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you mr dyan
 
04:23:15.429 --> 04:23:15.439 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
04:23:15.439 --> 04:23:16.950 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
um

04:23:16.950 --> 04:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:20.229 --> 04:23:20.239 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that the genus pond um
 
04:23:20.239 --> 04:23:21.670 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that the genus pond um
situation

04:23:21.670 --> 04:23:21.680 align:start position:0%
situation
 
04:23:23.670 --> 04:23:23.680 align:start position:0%
called for a stable water level this
 
04:23:25.590 --> 04:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
says a constant water level are you
 
04:23:27.189 --> 04:23:27.199 align:start position:0%
saying that constant should be changed
 
04:23:30.630 --> 04:23:30.640 align:start position:0%
for too stable or stable is not correct
 
04:23:32.469 --> 04:23:32.479 align:start position:0%
either i believe the reference in the
 
04:23:35.030 --> 04:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
legislation for genus pond uh implied
 
04:23:36.790 --> 04:23:36.800 align:start position:0%
that the level would not change once the
 
04:23:38.950 --> 04:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
dam was put in place the water level
 
04:23:40.950 --> 04:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
would not be manipulated there was a
 
04:23:43.030 --> 04:23:43.040 align:start position:0%
person who lived on the pond who who
 
04:23:44.550 --> 04:23:44.560 align:start position:0%
took exception to the fact that when
 
04:23:46.950 --> 04:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
they lowered the water body in the fall
 
04:23:49.189 --> 04:23:49.199 align:start position:0%
that was contrary to the statute because
 
04:23:50.790 --> 04:23:50.800 align:start position:0%
the statute said
 
04:23:52.790 --> 04:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
the dam shall maintain a constant water
 
04:23:52.800 --> 04:23:53.750 align:start position:0%
the dam shall maintain a constant water
level

04:23:53.750 --> 04:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
level
 
04:23:55.349 --> 04:23:55.359 align:start position:0%
so that manipulation allowed the water
 
04:23:57.030 --> 04:23:57.040 align:start position:0%
level to be lowered
 
04:23:58.870 --> 04:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
and i'm saying that if that flexibility
 
04:24:00.870 --> 04:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
is to be maintained at big p
 
04:24:03.030 --> 04:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
perhaps the wording of this legislation
 
04:24:04.870 --> 04:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
should maybe be altered to allow that
 
04:24:04.880 --> 04:24:08.830 align:start position:0%
should maybe be altered to allow that
flexibility

04:24:08.830 --> 04:24:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:11.910 --> 04:24:11.920 align:start position:0%
follow-up yeah so you are saying it
 
04:24:14.790 --> 04:24:14.800 align:start position:0%
should be you think that to make it
 
04:24:17.349 --> 04:24:17.359 align:start position:0%
better it would be changed to something
 
04:24:20.550 --> 04:24:20.560 align:start position:0%
like stable because stable is stable con
 
04:24:22.149 --> 04:24:22.159 align:start position:0%
the same as kant i mean what do you see
 
04:24:24.469 --> 04:24:24.479 align:start position:0%
as being the correct wording there what
 
04:24:25.990 --> 04:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
would you recommend i would either
 
04:24:28.389 --> 04:24:28.399 align:start position:0%
clarify the language in the statute to
 
04:24:28.399 --> 04:24:29.510 align:start position:0%
clarify the language in the statute to
allow

04:24:29.510 --> 04:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
allow
 
04:24:32.070 --> 04:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
a drawdown for example or manipulation
 
04:24:35.429 --> 04:24:35.439 align:start position:0%
of the level between parameters or to
 
04:24:36.870 --> 04:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
take that statement out of the
 
04:24:39.750 --> 04:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
legislation entirely
 
04:24:47.990 --> 04:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:54.630 --> 04:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:57.429 --> 04:24:57.439 align:start position:0%
well i just uh have
 
04:24:59.910 --> 04:24:59.920 align:start position:0%
one question uh
 
04:25:04.469 --> 04:25:04.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:07.670 --> 04:25:07.680 align:start position:0%
as you're adjusting as they they plan
 
04:25:09.269 --> 04:25:09.279 align:start position:0%
they i presume they're going to plan to
 
04:25:11.269 --> 04:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
adjust the
 
04:25:13.269 --> 04:25:13.279 align:start position:0%
the levels
 
04:25:13.279 --> 04:25:15.189 align:start position:0%
the levels
uh

04:25:15.189 --> 04:25:15.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:25:18.469 --> 04:25:18.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:21.189 --> 04:25:21.199 align:start position:0%
in the in the big pond
 
04:25:24.229 --> 04:25:24.239 align:start position:0%
and but also in this in the small pond
 
04:25:27.110 --> 04:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
in this middle and the small pond by use
 
04:25:29.590 --> 04:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
of the tube the two dams it's all going
 
04:25:31.110 --> 04:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
to be done
 
04:25:31.120 --> 04:25:32.630 align:start position:0%
to be done
uh

04:25:32.630 --> 04:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:25:33.990 --> 04:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
oh they're gonna it's gonna be kind of
 
04:25:37.510 --> 04:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
synchronized by by one up my one group
 
04:25:40.070 --> 04:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
you know i want to see one
 
04:25:42.950 --> 04:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
one area one lake dominating the other
 
04:25:42.960 --> 04:25:44.630 align:start position:0%
one area one lake dominating the other
lakes

04:25:44.630 --> 04:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
lakes
 
04:25:44.640 --> 04:25:45.670 align:start position:0%
lakes
correct

04:25:45.670 --> 04:25:45.680 align:start position:0%
correct
 
04:25:47.269 --> 04:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
my assumption would be that both groups
 
04:25:49.189 --> 04:25:49.199 align:start position:0%
would be talking about operations that
 
04:25:50.870 --> 04:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
exist but when the standard big p
 
04:25:53.189 --> 04:25:53.199 align:start position:0%
porridge pond is built
 
04:25:55.830 --> 04:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
each water body or i should say big p
 
04:25:57.269 --> 04:25:57.279 align:start position:0%
versus little and middle should be able
 
04:25:58.309 --> 04:25:58.319 align:start position:0%
to operate
 
04:26:00.309 --> 04:26:00.319 align:start position:0%
with their own dams to achieve whatever
 
04:26:01.429 --> 04:26:01.439 align:start position:0%
goals they have
 
04:26:02.790 --> 04:26:02.800 align:start position:0%
but yes you're right i mean we are
 
04:26:04.469 --> 04:26:04.479 align:start position:0%
certainly going to recommend that
 
04:26:06.710 --> 04:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
that operations at each location be
 
04:26:09.990 --> 04:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
coordinated between the parties
 
04:26:10.000 --> 04:26:10.870 align:start position:0%
coordinated between the parties
and

04:26:10.870 --> 04:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:26:10.880 --> 04:26:11.590 align:start position:0%
and
for

04:26:11.590 --> 04:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:26:13.990 --> 04:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
follow-up is that
 
04:26:18.149 --> 04:26:18.159 align:start position:0%
uh reviewed by the dam bureau
 
04:26:21.189 --> 04:26:21.199 align:start position:0%
the dam bureau requires that
 
04:26:23.189 --> 04:26:23.199 align:start position:0%
low and significant and high hazard dams
 
04:26:24.790 --> 04:26:24.800 align:start position:0%
have an operation and management plan
 
04:26:26.870 --> 04:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
that includes telling us what has to
 
04:26:28.710 --> 04:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
happen what what you intend to do to
 
04:26:30.229 --> 04:26:30.239 align:start position:0%
operate your dam i don't think that
 
04:26:32.630 --> 04:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
applies to non-menace dams but it could
 
04:26:34.710 --> 04:26:34.720 align:start position:0%
i believe so we would probably request
 
04:26:36.550 --> 04:26:36.560 align:start position:0%
that they submit a plan to us indicating
 
04:26:38.229 --> 04:26:38.239 align:start position:0%
how they intend to operate it which
 
04:26:39.670 --> 04:26:39.680 align:start position:0%
should then be available to anybody who
 
04:26:41.910 --> 04:26:41.920 align:start position:0%
needs to look at it okay
 
04:26:41.920 --> 04:26:42.830 align:start position:0%
needs to look at it okay
thank

04:26:42.830 --> 04:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:26:42.840 --> 04:26:44.790 align:start position:0%
thank
you

04:26:44.790 --> 04:26:44.800 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:26:48.389 --> 04:26:48.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:50.790 --> 04:26:50.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair sir uh i appreciate
 
04:26:53.349 --> 04:26:53.359 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
04:26:56.309 --> 04:26:56.319 align:start position:0%
my question really focuses on downstream
 
04:26:59.189 --> 04:26:59.199 align:start position:0%
uh impact and that as i'm looking at the
 
04:26:59.199 --> 04:27:00.070 align:start position:0%
uh impact and that as i'm looking at the
map

04:27:00.070 --> 04:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
map
 
04:27:02.469 --> 04:27:02.479 align:start position:0%
uh between big and middle
 
04:27:02.479 --> 04:27:04.309 align:start position:0%
uh between big and middle
um

04:27:04.309 --> 04:27:04.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:06.469 --> 04:27:06.479 align:start position:0%
once you put that down damn in there
 
04:27:09.110 --> 04:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
what what happens to that stream
 
04:27:12.550 --> 04:27:12.560 align:start position:0%
in if you looked at the impact on
 
04:27:12.560 --> 04:27:13.269 align:start position:0%
in if you looked at the impact on
uh

04:27:13.269 --> 04:27:13.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:27:14.950 --> 04:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
on the locals that are in and around
 
04:27:17.189 --> 04:27:17.199 align:start position:0%
there on on the impact of that stream
 
04:27:19.429 --> 04:27:19.439 align:start position:0%
downstream of the dam
 
04:27:21.590 --> 04:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
the the simplest answer and the most
 
04:27:23.110 --> 04:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
practical answer is that it shouldn't
 
04:27:25.110 --> 04:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
make much difference because right now
 
04:27:26.790 --> 04:27:26.800 align:start position:0%
when things get dry you're still getting
 
04:27:28.550 --> 04:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
evaporation out of the out of big p
 
04:27:30.309 --> 04:27:30.319 align:start position:0%
which is the biggest water
 
04:27:31.670 --> 04:27:31.680 align:start position:0%
sink there
 
04:27:33.510 --> 04:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
so when things dry up the brook dries up
 
04:27:33.520 --> 04:27:34.469 align:start position:0%
so when things dry up the brook dries up
now

04:27:34.469 --> 04:27:34.479 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:27:36.229 --> 04:27:36.239 align:start position:0%
to some degree
 
04:27:38.550 --> 04:27:38.560 align:start position:0%
so with big p maintained a few inches
 
04:27:40.389 --> 04:27:40.399 align:start position:0%
higher than it currently is with a stop
 
04:27:40.399 --> 04:27:41.189 align:start position:0%
higher than it currently is with a stop
log

04:27:41.189 --> 04:27:41.199 align:start position:0%
log
 
04:27:42.710 --> 04:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
you're still going to get inflow equals
 
04:27:44.790 --> 04:27:44.800 align:start position:0%
outflow until such time as there is no
 
04:27:47.510 --> 04:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
inflow and evaporation is
 
04:27:48.790 --> 04:27:48.800 align:start position:0%
controlling like during the droughts
 
04:27:50.630 --> 04:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
that we had so there could be times and
 
04:27:52.790 --> 04:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
there are times now where that stretch
 
04:27:54.870 --> 04:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
of river river between big p and middle
 
04:27:54.880 --> 04:27:55.590 align:start position:0%
of river river between big p and middle
p

04:27:55.590 --> 04:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
p
 
04:27:57.189 --> 04:27:57.199 align:start position:0%
is uh you know has very little water in
 
04:27:57.199 --> 04:27:57.910 align:start position:0%
is uh you know has very little water in
it

04:27:57.910 --> 04:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:28:00.070 --> 04:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
but that's no change
 
04:28:01.830 --> 04:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
technically no change over what it is
 
04:28:02.950 --> 04:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
today no
 
04:28:08.630 --> 04:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:10.950 --> 04:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
04:28:12.149 --> 04:28:12.159 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
04:28:15.189 --> 04:28:15.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:15.199 --> 04:28:22.630 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:28:22.630 --> 04:28:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:27.429 --> 04:28:27.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:29.189 --> 04:28:29.199 align:start position:0%
somebody named john
 
04:28:31.429 --> 04:28:31.439 align:start position:0%
from the uh
 
04:28:37.189 --> 04:28:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:39.670 --> 04:28:39.680 align:start position:0%
uh yeah i think you need to spell that
 
04:28:39.680 --> 04:28:40.550 align:start position:0%
uh yeah i think you need to spell that
it's

04:28:40.550 --> 04:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:28:42.710 --> 04:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
it's three words put together
 
04:28:48.790 --> 04:28:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:52.790 --> 04:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:53.590 --> 04:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:28:53.600 --> 04:28:54.469 align:start position:0%
all right
uh

04:28:54.469 --> 04:28:54.479 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:28:55.910 --> 04:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
and you you're
 
04:28:58.790 --> 04:28:58.800 align:start position:0%
you represent the pea parge
 
04:28:58.800 --> 04:29:00.309 align:start position:0%
you represent the pea parge

04:29:07.990 --> 04:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
you support the bill
 
04:29:08.000 --> 04:29:10.229 align:start position:0%
you support the bill
and

04:29:10.229 --> 04:29:10.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:29:12.550 --> 04:29:12.560 align:start position:0%
the floor is yours
 
04:29:14.070 --> 04:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:29:17.030 --> 04:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:19.429 --> 04:29:19.439 align:start position:0%
what i uh what i have here is this is um
 
04:29:21.590 --> 04:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
part the pres i made the presentation
 
04:29:24.550 --> 04:29:24.560 align:start position:0%
this is an hour-long presentation
 
04:29:27.830 --> 04:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
reduce it to four minutes
 
04:29:30.790 --> 04:29:30.800 align:start position:0%
four minutes mcconkey says no way so
 
04:29:33.429 --> 04:29:33.439 align:start position:0%
four minutes really fast through
 
04:29:35.110 --> 04:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
the primary purpose as as was speak
 
04:29:37.110 --> 04:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
before is to maintain stable water
 
04:29:40.070 --> 04:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
levels at the natural or slightly below
 
04:29:42.070 --> 04:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
the natural level of the pond
 
04:29:43.830 --> 04:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
that's it we're not raising the water
 
04:29:47.269 --> 04:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
level so there should be less impact on
 
04:29:49.189 --> 04:29:49.199 align:start position:0%
septic systems it's already where it
 
04:29:50.469 --> 04:29:50.479 align:start position:0%
should be
 
04:29:52.389 --> 04:29:52.399 align:start position:0%
so if we go through he showed the
 
04:29:54.309 --> 04:29:54.319 align:start position:0%
picture of the ponds
 
04:29:55.590 --> 04:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to go over that what they
 
04:29:58.149 --> 04:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
did is in 1967 they built a dam at lower
 
04:30:01.750 --> 04:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
p the intent was to have all these p all
 
04:30:04.149 --> 04:30:04.159 align:start position:0%
these pawns at the same level so that
 
04:30:06.870 --> 04:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
actual dam is higher than level at the
 
04:30:10.149 --> 04:30:10.159 align:start position:0%
lowest point the control point of big p
 
04:30:11.830 --> 04:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
okay so that's what they did
 
04:30:13.590 --> 04:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
unfortunately when they got to big p
 
04:30:15.349 --> 04:30:15.359 align:start position:0%
they stopped them from dredging things
 
04:30:18.469 --> 04:30:18.479 align:start position:0%
out so that it's a great pond the state
 
04:30:21.910 --> 04:30:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:23.670 --> 04:30:23.680 align:start position:0%
we'll slip over this slide i'll go
 
04:30:25.590 --> 04:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
really quickly this is the water level
 
04:30:27.510 --> 04:30:27.520 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire it's pretty constant
 
04:30:29.910 --> 04:30:29.920 align:start position:0%
about four inches per month is what you
 
04:30:31.990 --> 04:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
get the big point about this slide is
 
04:30:35.030 --> 04:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
that in april when you have your runoff
 
04:30:36.630 --> 04:30:36.640 align:start position:0%
that's when your lake's the highest you
 
04:30:39.349 --> 04:30:39.359 align:start position:0%
have to retain that water because after
 
04:30:41.910 --> 04:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
that it declines your water's the same
 
04:30:44.389 --> 04:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
your rain is the same the problem is you
 
04:30:46.790 --> 04:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
cannot the level's going to drop simply
 
04:30:48.710 --> 04:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
because of
 
04:30:50.149 --> 04:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
plants trees
 
04:30:51.830 --> 04:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
the land's dry
 
04:30:53.990 --> 04:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
evaporation so we'll go to the next
 
04:30:54.000 --> 04:30:55.429 align:start position:0%
evaporation so we'll go to the next
slide

04:30:55.429 --> 04:30:55.439 align:start position:0%
slide
 
04:30:59.990 --> 04:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
this is the slide loons and beavers okay
 
04:31:02.710 --> 04:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
this is what's causing the fluctuation
 
04:31:04.469 --> 04:31:04.479 align:start position:0%
so little p
 
04:31:07.750 --> 04:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
has a loon this loon by the lpc john
 
04:31:10.550 --> 04:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
cooley this productive rate of this loan
 
04:31:14.070 --> 04:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
is 43 percent higher than the state
 
04:31:15.990 --> 04:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
this is this is the core loan of the
 
04:31:17.750 --> 04:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
territory of new hampshire
 
04:31:19.269 --> 04:31:19.279 align:start position:0%
this has been very productive in
 
04:31:19.279 --> 04:31:20.710 align:start position:0%
this has been very productive in
producing

04:31:20.710 --> 04:31:20.720 align:start position:0%
producing
 
04:31:23.510 --> 04:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
the issue is is that little p
 
04:31:26.070 --> 04:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
in order to do alone it's in the may
 
04:31:27.750 --> 04:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
time frame
 
04:31:30.149 --> 04:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
its nest is actually the place that nest
 
04:31:32.950 --> 04:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
is actually 12 inches below
 
04:31:35.349 --> 04:31:35.359 align:start position:0%
the top of the dam so they're draining
 
04:31:37.189 --> 04:31:37.199 align:start position:0%
water instead like a normal path they
 
04:31:39.990 --> 04:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
drain the water down to get to that loon
 
04:31:42.229 --> 04:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
what that causes is fluctuation on our
 
04:31:44.469 --> 04:31:44.479 align:start position:0%
end this is artificial man-made
 
04:31:44.479 --> 04:31:46.229 align:start position:0%
end this is artificial man-made
fluctuation

04:31:46.229 --> 04:31:46.239 align:start position:0%
fluctuation
 
04:31:48.229 --> 04:31:48.239 align:start position:0%
animals aren't used to that the second
 
04:31:50.630 --> 04:31:50.640 align:start position:0%
part is beavers every one to four years
 
04:31:53.189 --> 04:31:53.199 align:start position:0%
we have a beaver a beaver builds up in
 
04:31:55.189 --> 04:31:55.199 align:start position:0%
our stream up near big p
 
04:31:56.870 --> 04:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
every four years we take it down well
 
04:31:58.309 --> 04:31:58.319 align:start position:0%
what happens with the beaver our water
 
04:32:00.550 --> 04:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
level goes up with the beaver dam and
 
04:32:02.550 --> 04:32:02.560 align:start position:0%
then it gets taken down that's a foot
 
04:32:05.030 --> 04:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
loss so here we are here's the loon
 
04:32:07.429 --> 04:32:07.439 align:start position:0%
throughout the years beaver dam loss
 
04:32:09.429 --> 04:32:09.439 align:start position:0%
loon throughout the years beaver dam
 
04:32:11.750 --> 04:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
loss we're getting so much fluctuation
 
04:32:14.389 --> 04:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
on our water levels at big p
 
04:32:15.990 --> 04:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
let's take a look at the chart the next
 
04:32:17.910 --> 04:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
one this is an illustration i actually
 
04:32:19.670 --> 04:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
took this out of
 
04:32:22.229 --> 04:32:22.239 align:start position:0%
winnipesaukee this is theirs so the side
 
04:32:24.469 --> 04:32:24.479 align:start position:0%
is not the actual water level
 
04:32:26.870 --> 04:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
but the chart that i wrote in represents
 
04:32:29.349 --> 04:32:29.359 align:start position:0%
the actual drop of water level so in
 
04:32:31.510 --> 04:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
this illustration you can see
 
04:32:33.269 --> 04:32:33.279 align:start position:0%
water has a natural ability in the
 
04:32:35.429 --> 04:32:35.439 align:start position:0%
runoff early spring you try to get your
 
04:32:37.110 --> 04:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
water up to your highest level that you
 
04:32:38.550 --> 04:32:38.560 align:start position:0%
want to reach
 
04:32:39.990 --> 04:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
that's where you want it because after
 
04:32:41.910 --> 04:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
that it's just going to drain the rain
 
04:32:43.590 --> 04:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
comes it's not you're not going to keep
 
04:32:43.600 --> 04:32:44.790 align:start position:0%
comes it's not you're not going to keep
it

04:32:44.790 --> 04:32:44.800 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:32:46.790 --> 04:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
during that time
 
04:32:49.110 --> 04:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
during the may to
 
04:32:50.469 --> 04:32:50.479 align:start position:0%
june july
 
04:32:53.110 --> 04:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
extremely important to maintain solid
 
04:32:55.189 --> 04:32:55.199 align:start position:0%
stable water levels
 
04:32:57.670 --> 04:32:57.680 align:start position:0%
creatures frogs amphibians laying eggs
 
04:32:59.590 --> 04:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
the fish are coming in nesting close to
 
04:33:03.590 --> 04:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
shore that shoreline of 0 to 15 feet is
 
04:33:06.470 --> 04:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
massive to the health of ponds and lakes
 
04:33:07.910 --> 04:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
you have to maintain that you have to
 
04:33:10.070 --> 04:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
let them do it what happens is if you
 
04:33:12.230 --> 04:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
look on the side vdoe
 
04:33:14.551 --> 04:33:14.561 align:start position:0%
environmental penny did an observation
 
04:33:17.029 --> 04:33:17.039 align:start position:0%
and tract here we are first this is what
 
04:33:20.070 --> 04:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
little p does a board's already out
 
04:33:21.510 --> 04:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
early during
 
04:33:24.390 --> 04:33:24.400 align:start position:0%
during the uh winter and fall
 
04:33:28.789 --> 04:33:28.799 align:start position:0%
early spring at this time if you look at
 
04:33:31.590 --> 04:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
the 17th of may they remove a second
 
04:33:33.990 --> 04:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
board that's 20 inches they're trying to
 
04:33:36.150 --> 04:33:36.160 align:start position:0%
take off the water level they're not
 
04:33:37.670 --> 04:33:37.680 align:start position:0%
trying to keep a high level they're
 
04:33:40.470 --> 04:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
trying to get it down 12 inches what
 
04:33:42.949 --> 04:33:42.959 align:start position:0%
happened to us we observed through the
 
04:33:44.470 --> 04:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
what was observed for the environmental
 
04:33:47.349 --> 04:33:47.359 align:start position:0%
committee is that between 517 the time
 
04:33:49.750 --> 04:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
they took that board out our water at
 
04:33:50.789 --> 04:33:50.799 align:start position:0%
big p
 
04:33:54.949 --> 04:33:54.959 align:start position:0%
dropped nine inches in ten days
 
04:33:58.390 --> 04:33:58.400 align:start position:0%
this is during prime reproduction of
 
04:34:00.230 --> 04:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
amphibians fish and everything we're
 
04:34:00.240 --> 04:34:01.670 align:start position:0%
amphibians fish and everything we're
fluctuating

04:34:01.670 --> 04:34:01.680 align:start position:0%
fluctuating
 
04:34:03.429 --> 04:34:03.439 align:start position:0%
this doesn't always happen because once
 
04:34:05.830 --> 04:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
again we get that beaver dam that we
 
04:34:08.390 --> 04:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
love i love the beaver dam it protects
 
04:34:11.189 --> 04:34:11.199 align:start position:0%
us slightly but then we get this waffle
 
04:34:13.590 --> 04:34:13.600 align:start position:0%
beaver dam's gone it comes up protects
 
04:34:13.600 --> 04:34:14.310 align:start position:0%
beaver dam's gone it comes up protects
us

04:34:14.310 --> 04:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
us
 
04:34:16.150 --> 04:34:16.160 align:start position:0%
drops every four years we can't leave
 
04:34:18.390 --> 04:34:18.400 align:start position:0%
the beaver dam up there because um they
 
04:34:20.070 --> 04:34:20.080 align:start position:0%
can't survive you have to take them out
 
04:34:22.470 --> 04:34:22.480 align:start position:0%
they just want to control more water
 
04:34:24.869 --> 04:34:24.879 align:start position:0%
next slide i'm going to skip impact and
 
04:34:27.109 --> 04:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
skip the pitcher
 
04:34:28.949 --> 04:34:28.959 align:start position:0%
mouth of damp has been talked about
 
04:34:31.109 --> 04:34:31.119 align:start position:0%
here's the creek picture of it
 
04:34:33.429 --> 04:34:33.439 align:start position:0%
as as he mentioned there's actually used
 
04:34:36.390 --> 04:34:36.400 align:start position:0%
to be a screen a fish screen in here
 
04:34:38.949 --> 04:34:38.959 align:start position:0%
that was two two feet high
 
04:34:41.029 --> 04:34:41.039 align:start position:0%
in this stream and underneath is a
 
04:34:43.429 --> 04:34:43.439 align:start position:0%
cement um you can't see it but there's
 
04:34:45.029 --> 04:34:45.039 align:start position:0%
suspense slab that's where we want the
 
04:34:45.039 --> 04:34:45.990 align:start position:0%
suspense slab that's where we want the
dam

04:34:45.990 --> 04:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
dam
 
04:34:48.070 --> 04:34:48.080 align:start position:0%
so here's a picture this was sent from
 
04:34:50.390 --> 04:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
the dan bureau
 
04:34:52.310 --> 04:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
this picture shows the cement structure
 
04:34:54.869 --> 04:34:54.879 align:start position:0%
this is a different place this is jensen
 
04:34:56.230 --> 04:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
but this is a
 
04:34:58.230 --> 04:34:58.240 align:start position:0%
an example of what it could look like
 
04:34:59.990 --> 04:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
just cement things on the side of the
 
04:35:03.910 --> 04:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
brook and you have boards in it
 
04:35:05.830 --> 04:35:05.840 align:start position:0%
and you can take the boards out for the
 
04:35:10.789 --> 04:35:10.799 align:start position:0%
fall draw down and so lastly
 
04:35:12.629 --> 04:35:12.639 align:start position:0%
although the last part
 
04:35:12.639 --> 04:35:14.869 align:start position:0%
although the last part
is

04:35:14.869 --> 04:35:14.879 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:35:17.510 --> 04:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
the dam itself we're looking at 18
 
04:35:20.310 --> 04:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
inches 12 inches it depends this is
 
04:35:23.189 --> 04:35:23.199 align:start position:0%
where we really really beg
 
04:35:24.949 --> 04:35:24.959 align:start position:0%
we've been trying to do this for five
 
04:35:26.869 --> 04:35:26.879 align:start position:0%
years we beg fish and game to come in
 
04:35:28.789 --> 04:35:28.799 align:start position:0%
and help us through this and the dam
 
04:35:30.470 --> 04:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
bureau what
 
04:35:32.551 --> 04:35:32.561 align:start position:0%
all we care about is what's best for the
 
04:35:32.561 --> 04:35:33.429 align:start position:0%
all we care about is what's best for the
lake

04:35:33.429 --> 04:35:33.439 align:start position:0%
lake
 
04:35:35.109 --> 04:35:35.119 align:start position:0%
they'll help us determine what that
 
04:35:37.670 --> 04:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
level should be for the aquatic life and
 
04:35:41.830 --> 04:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:44.869 --> 04:35:44.879 align:start position:0%
so last again it's to maintain water
 
04:35:46.709 --> 04:35:46.719 align:start position:0%
levels kind of make it more steady
 
04:35:48.551 --> 04:35:48.561 align:start position:0%
during those fluctuations these are
 
04:35:51.269 --> 04:35:51.279 align:start position:0%
artificial fluctuations every biologist
 
04:35:53.349 --> 04:35:53.359 align:start position:0%
everyone talks about it the fish can
 
04:35:55.670 --> 04:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
handle the rain the small rains the
 
04:35:58.150 --> 04:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
schedules they cannot handle the
 
04:36:00.551 --> 04:36:00.561 align:start position:0%
manual fluctuations as well as the big
 
04:36:02.949 --> 04:36:02.959 align:start position:0%
drops on the beaver dams so that
 
04:36:05.990 --> 04:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
concludes my quick presentation for the
 
04:36:06.000 --> 04:36:09.990 align:start position:0%
concludes my quick presentation for the
hour

04:36:09.990 --> 04:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:11.269 --> 04:36:11.279 align:start position:0%
i'm just going to grab a little water
 
04:36:23.429 --> 04:36:23.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:23.439 --> 04:36:25.429 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:36:25.429 --> 04:36:25.439 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:36:28.789 --> 04:36:28.799 align:start position:0%
any questions for members of the board
 
04:36:30.869 --> 04:36:30.879 align:start position:0%
representative egan thank you mr chair
 
04:36:32.310 --> 04:36:32.320 align:start position:0%
thank you sir for taking my question you
 
04:36:35.269 --> 04:36:35.279 align:start position:0%
referenced a few times they so is there
 
04:36:35.279 --> 04:36:36.551 align:start position:0%
referenced a few times they so is there
a

04:36:36.551 --> 04:36:36.561 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:36:39.029 --> 04:36:39.039 align:start position:0%
specific community group environmental
 
04:36:41.109 --> 04:36:41.119 align:start position:0%
group that will oversee
 
04:36:42.629 --> 04:36:42.639 align:start position:0%
when the boards go in when the boards go
 
04:36:45.189 --> 04:36:45.199 align:start position:0%
out monitors the water monitors the
 
04:36:48.070 --> 04:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
the level and who is that and how does
 
04:36:49.830 --> 04:36:49.840 align:start position:0%
that process work
 
04:36:51.910 --> 04:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
um there's there's two parts there's
 
04:36:53.750 --> 04:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
there's a dam at little p and that's
 
04:36:55.429 --> 04:36:55.439 align:start position:0%
controlled as he mentioned by the
 
04:36:57.590 --> 04:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
village district of idaho ice what
 
04:36:59.510 --> 04:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
happened is they formed a community
 
04:37:01.990 --> 04:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
around this mountain area for the lakes
 
04:37:02.000 --> 04:37:02.789 align:start position:0%
around this mountain area for the lakes
um

04:37:02.789 --> 04:37:02.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:04.789 --> 04:37:04.799 align:start position:0%
the village district controls their so
 
04:37:06.629 --> 04:37:06.639 align:start position:0%
they're dropping it for the loons
 
04:37:08.310 --> 04:37:08.320 align:start position:0%
they're trying to maintain it but it
 
04:37:09.510 --> 04:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
keeps changing over the years because
 
04:37:13.429 --> 04:37:13.439 align:start position:0%
commissioners change as far as this goes
 
04:37:15.670 --> 04:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
our bill says we are i'm actually
 
04:37:17.910 --> 04:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
actually talk after talking to a lot of
 
04:37:20.150 --> 04:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
people on the lake and stuff
 
04:37:22.709 --> 04:37:22.719 align:start position:0%
we're potentially thinking
 
04:37:25.189 --> 04:37:25.199 align:start position:0%
to have the village district of idaho
 
04:37:27.349 --> 04:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
ice control we think that that might be
 
04:37:28.709 --> 04:37:28.719 align:start position:0%
a better approach
 
04:37:31.510 --> 04:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
ours is not to my job in our group's job
 
04:37:34.150 --> 04:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
we want stable water levels we feel that
 
04:37:36.230 --> 04:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
in that combination we might be best to
 
04:37:38.310 --> 04:37:38.320 align:start position:0%
relieve ourselves from this and have the
 
04:37:40.390 --> 04:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
village district control it
 
04:37:42.551 --> 04:37:42.561 align:start position:0%
with that said a lot of people felt that
 
04:37:43.910 --> 04:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
the village district because of
 
04:37:45.910 --> 04:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
fluctuation in kind of in-road fights of
 
04:37:47.510 --> 04:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
protecting the loans and protecting the
 
04:37:47.520 --> 04:37:49.029 align:start position:0%
protecting the loans and protecting the
water

04:37:49.029 --> 04:37:49.039 align:start position:0%
water
 
04:37:51.029 --> 04:37:51.039 align:start position:0%
we would recommend we want it to be
 
04:37:53.830 --> 04:37:53.840 align:start position:0%
stable we we prefer it to be in and then
 
04:37:56.310 --> 04:37:56.320 align:start position:0%
maybe as steve recommended talk to the
 
04:37:58.709 --> 04:37:58.719 align:start position:0%
danbury what we can do so that we're not
 
04:38:00.470 --> 04:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
constantly moving for the for the
 
04:38:02.709 --> 04:38:02.719 align:start position:0%
fluctuations we really want it stable so
 
04:38:04.551 --> 04:38:04.561 align:start position:0%
our group can say hey people aren't
 
04:38:06.390 --> 04:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
messing with this we just get into that
 
04:38:07.590 --> 04:38:07.600 align:start position:0%
natural level
 
04:38:09.910 --> 04:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
and then after take it out they did he
 
04:38:11.429 --> 04:38:11.439 align:start position:0%
did recommend because of flooding and
 
04:38:13.429 --> 04:38:13.439 align:start position:0%
stuff to take it out for the fall
 
04:38:13.439 --> 04:38:15.590 align:start position:0%
stuff to take it out for the fall
drawdown

04:38:15.590 --> 04:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
drawdown
 
04:38:17.510 --> 04:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
that is my approach and that that's what
 
04:38:19.109 --> 04:38:19.119 align:start position:0%
after talking to people i would
 
04:38:21.510 --> 04:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
recommend now that i've i've talked to
 
04:38:21.520 --> 04:38:22.390 align:start position:0%
recommend now that i've i've talked to
people

04:38:22.390 --> 04:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:38:25.189 --> 04:38:25.199 align:start position:0%
that would cause a another change
 
04:38:31.269 --> 04:38:31.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:33.670 --> 04:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
any other questions oh just follow up
 
04:38:35.429 --> 04:38:35.439 align:start position:0%
just to clarify so you're talking about
 
04:38:37.510 --> 04:38:37.520 align:start position:0%

if if i could i'd prefer my legislation
 
04:38:44.150 --> 04:38:44.160 align:start position:0%

who's representing the bill to address
that

04:38:45.590 --> 04:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:38:46.949 --> 04:38:46.959 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry the committee who is
 
04:38:49.269 --> 04:38:49.279 align:start position:0%

thank you sir any uh

04:39:10.310 --> 04:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes
 
04:39:11.990 --> 04:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
peter cunn
 
04:39:14.150 --> 04:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
kond is it our
 
04:39:18.949 --> 04:39:18.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:20.390 --> 04:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
well uh
 
04:39:23.750 --> 04:39:23.760 align:start position:0%

04:39:27.189 --> 04:39:27.199 align:start position:0%
uh she and you you were in opposition i
 
04:39:27.199 --> 04:39:30.709 align:start position:0%
uh she and you you were in opposition i
am

04:39:30.709 --> 04:39:30.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:33.349 --> 04:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
the floor is yours now just give your
 
04:39:36.070 --> 04:39:36.080 align:start position:0%
name and your address
 
04:39:38.390 --> 04:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
my name is peter condra and i live on
 
04:39:41.670 --> 04:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
the pond at 89 first meadow road
 
04:39:43.990 --> 04:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
and i've lived there now for a few years
 
04:39:45.910 --> 04:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
there are likely 70 plus households that
 
04:39:47.430 --> 04:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
border the pond
 
04:39:48.948 --> 04:39:48.958 align:start position:0%
and many more people that use it for
 
04:39:51.350 --> 04:39:51.360 align:start position:0%
recreational purposes
 
04:39:53.910 --> 04:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
for a small group five as of now such as
 
04:39:55.430 --> 04:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
this to claim they are acting for the
 
04:39:55.440 --> 04:39:56.948 align:start position:0%
this to claim they are acting for the
majority

04:39:56.948 --> 04:39:56.958 align:start position:0%
majority
 
04:39:59.430 --> 04:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
is far from the case
 
04:40:01.030 --> 04:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
i attended their zoom meeting and came
 
04:40:02.550 --> 04:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
away very uneasy about what they are
 
04:40:02.560 --> 04:40:03.990 align:start position:0%
away very uneasy about what they are
proposing

04:40:03.990 --> 04:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
proposing
 
04:40:06.230 --> 04:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
there is insufficient data to support
 
04:40:07.590 --> 04:40:07.600 align:start position:0%
their claims
 
04:40:09.030 --> 04:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
something that should be strongly
 
04:40:09.040 --> 04:40:11.590 align:start position:0%
something that should be strongly
considered

04:40:11.590 --> 04:40:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:13.430 --> 04:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
it seems the main driving force for this
 
04:40:16.070 --> 04:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
request is that the vdoe the village
 
04:40:18.070 --> 04:40:18.080 align:start position:0%
district of idaho ice
 
04:40:20.868 --> 04:40:20.878 align:start position:0%
does not properly control their dam
 
04:40:22.390 --> 04:40:22.400 align:start position:0%
this dam could turn into the same
 
04:40:22.400 --> 04:40:23.590 align:start position:0%
this dam could turn into the same
situation

04:40:23.590 --> 04:40:23.600 align:start position:0%
situation
 
04:40:25.750 --> 04:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
with the majority of our pond having no
 
04:40:28.390 --> 04:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
say over water levels
 
04:40:30.150 --> 04:40:30.160 align:start position:0%
this group of the minority wants to
 
04:40:32.708 --> 04:40:32.718 align:start position:0%
assume the role of controlling the dam
 
04:40:34.470 --> 04:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
and based on the history of what has
 
04:40:36.868 --> 04:40:36.878 align:start position:0%
gone on with vdoe
 
04:40:38.708 --> 04:40:38.718 align:start position:0%
this is a terrible idea
 
04:40:40.550 --> 04:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
the ramifications of playing with water
 
04:40:40.560 --> 04:40:41.750 align:start position:0%
the ramifications of playing with water
levels

04:40:41.750 --> 04:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
levels
 
04:40:44.070 --> 04:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
can be very far-reaching in ways that we
 
04:40:46.948 --> 04:40:46.958 align:start position:0%
cannot predict
 
04:40:48.788 --> 04:40:48.798 align:start position:0%
more study needs to be done before this
 
04:40:50.550 --> 04:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
is ever going to be considered a good
 
04:40:50.560 --> 04:40:51.990 align:start position:0%
is ever going to be considered a good
idea

04:40:51.990 --> 04:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
idea
 
04:40:53.830 --> 04:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
the pond has survived without our
 
04:40:56.550 --> 04:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
intervention for thousands of years
 
04:40:58.150 --> 04:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
just because we had a recent drought
 
04:40:58.160 --> 04:40:59.030 align:start position:0%
just because we had a recent drought
problem

04:40:59.030 --> 04:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
problem
 
04:41:01.750 --> 04:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
as did the rest of the northeast
 
04:41:05.190 --> 04:41:05.200 align:start position:0%
this seems to be a rush to judgment
 
04:41:06.788 --> 04:41:06.798 align:start position:0%
there are too many events that could
 
04:41:09.190 --> 04:41:09.200 align:start position:0%
happen with this very few of them would
 
04:41:10.788 --> 04:41:10.798 align:start position:0%
be good
 
04:41:12.788 --> 04:41:12.798 align:start position:0%
if due to this proposed dam the pond
 
04:41:15.430 --> 04:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
becomes contaminated forever
 
04:41:17.350 --> 04:41:17.360 align:start position:0%
who is responsible
 
04:41:20.150 --> 04:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
if the dam breaches and floods
 
04:41:22.948 --> 04:41:22.958 align:start position:0%
100 plus homes downstream
 
04:41:25.350 --> 04:41:25.360 align:start position:0%
who's responsible
 
04:41:26.948 --> 04:41:26.958 align:start position:0%
if these people in control of the dam
 
04:41:29.590 --> 04:41:29.600 align:start position:0%
for some reason leave the area
 
04:41:33.590 --> 04:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:35.430 --> 04:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
who even owns the dam
 
04:41:37.270 --> 04:41:37.280 align:start position:0%
and i think they address that that they
 
04:41:39.350 --> 04:41:39.360 align:start position:0%
they're trying to make the vdoe take
 
04:41:41.190 --> 04:41:41.200 align:start position:0%
that over but
 
04:41:42.708 --> 04:41:42.718 align:start position:0%
at the zoom meeting it was very unclear
 
04:41:43.990 --> 04:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of
 
04:41:46.390 --> 04:41:46.400 align:start position:0%
very unclear information that
 
04:41:48.628 --> 04:41:48.638 align:start position:0%
just left me
 
04:41:49.750 --> 04:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
in the
 
04:41:51.990 --> 04:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
trust me department and i'm not filled
 
04:41:54.948 --> 04:41:54.958 align:start position:0%
with trust here there are way too many
 
04:41:56.868 --> 04:41:56.878 align:start position:0%
questions and not enough answers and i
 
04:41:59.110 --> 04:41:59.120 align:start position:0%
would urge you to please vote against
 
04:42:06.788 --> 04:42:06.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:08.310 --> 04:42:08.320 align:start position:0%
any questions by members of the
 
04:42:08.320 --> 04:42:11.110 align:start position:0%
any questions by members of the
committee

04:42:11.110 --> 04:42:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:13.430 --> 04:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
representative huff
 
04:42:15.110 --> 04:42:15.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
04:42:18.230 --> 04:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
coming and testifying um my question is
 
04:42:20.830 --> 04:42:20.840 align:start position:0%
you obviously live there yes
 
04:42:23.190 --> 04:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
um and i'm assuming it's a very nice
 
04:42:25.270 --> 04:42:25.280 align:start position:0%
place i love it
 
04:42:27.750 --> 04:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
so my question is
 
04:42:27.760 --> 04:42:28.628 align:start position:0%
so my question is
um

04:42:28.628 --> 04:42:28.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:30.708 --> 04:42:30.718 align:start position:0%
as you alluded to it's been there for a
 
04:42:31.910 --> 04:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
long time
 
04:42:34.550 --> 04:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
and it uh
 
04:42:39.350 --> 04:42:39.360 align:start position:0%
all of the life that is around that pond
 
04:42:41.270 --> 04:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
seems to be there
 
04:42:43.990 --> 04:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
i don't understand
 
04:42:45.350 --> 04:42:45.360 align:start position:0%
why the
 
04:42:49.030 --> 04:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
need for a specific level
 
04:42:50.708 --> 04:42:50.718 align:start position:0%
i don't know if you know the answer to
 
04:42:51.750 --> 04:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
that but
 
04:42:53.030 --> 04:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
i i think
 
04:42:55.190 --> 04:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
it's maybe i'm going on for a while but
 
04:42:55.200 --> 04:42:56.070 align:start position:0%
it's maybe i'm going on for a while but
um

04:42:56.070 --> 04:42:56.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:58.150 --> 04:42:58.160 align:start position:0%
there's certain
 
04:42:59.670 --> 04:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
changes that occurs with with different
 
04:43:01.190 --> 04:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
levels at different times of the year
 
04:43:02.708 --> 04:43:02.718 align:start position:0%
and we've all been experienced at this
 
04:43:04.070 --> 04:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
drought i mean this summer everyone
 
04:43:05.510 --> 04:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
knows it was bad
 
04:43:07.430 --> 04:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
water levels were down they came back up
 
04:43:09.830 --> 04:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
i mean this happens we can't
 
04:43:12.390 --> 04:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
i don't think we need to to play god
 
04:43:14.628 --> 04:43:14.638 align:start position:0%
here i think we should let
 
04:43:17.110 --> 04:43:17.120 align:start position:0%
let this pond happen i mean i don't know
 
04:43:19.270 --> 04:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
if that really answers your question but
 
04:43:19.280 --> 04:43:21.030 align:start position:0%
if that really answers your question but
um

04:43:21.030 --> 04:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:23.430 --> 04:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
maintaining the water levels i think
 
04:43:26.470 --> 04:43:26.480 align:start position:0%
on the service is a great idea i suppose
 
04:43:28.550 --> 04:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
but what's that level who who determines
 
04:43:30.310 --> 04:43:30.320 align:start position:0%
that is there science involved we can't
 
04:43:30.320 --> 04:43:31.430 align:start position:0%
that is there science involved we can't
just

04:43:31.430 --> 04:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
just
 
04:43:33.030 --> 04:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
jump in and say i think this is what it
 
04:43:34.070 --> 04:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
should be
 
04:43:35.270 --> 04:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
when really
 
04:43:37.830 --> 04:43:37.840 align:start position:0%
that is what it should be
 
04:43:41.190 --> 04:43:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:43.190 --> 04:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
anyone else from the committee
 
04:43:44.628 --> 04:43:44.638 align:start position:0%
representative creighton followed by
 
04:43:46.708 --> 04:43:46.718 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
04:43:48.550 --> 04:43:48.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman sir i appreciate
 
04:43:51.350 --> 04:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
your your testimony and and
 
04:43:53.110 --> 04:43:53.120 align:start position:0%
this is a difficult issue
 
04:43:53.120 --> 04:43:53.910 align:start position:0%
this is a difficult issue
um

04:43:53.910 --> 04:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:55.910 --> 04:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to tie together your
 
04:43:58.070 --> 04:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
testimony with the picture and the
 
04:43:59.670 --> 04:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
previous testimony
 
04:44:03.110 --> 04:44:03.120 align:start position:0%
so the the dam that i that was
 
04:44:04.948 --> 04:44:04.958 align:start position:0%
demonstrated as what they want to put in
 
04:44:07.510 --> 04:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
there was less than 18 inches tall
 
04:44:09.990 --> 04:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
and it was controlled by logs
 
04:44:13.350 --> 04:44:13.360 align:start position:0%
that come in and come out fairly easily
 
04:44:15.190 --> 04:44:15.200 align:start position:0%
apparently you know just looking at the
 
04:44:16.628 --> 04:44:16.638 align:start position:0%
picture they just come out of little
 
04:44:16.638 --> 04:44:17.670 align:start position:0%
picture they just come out of little
channels

04:44:17.670 --> 04:44:17.680 align:start position:0%
channels
 
04:44:17.680 --> 04:44:18.948 align:start position:0%
channels
so

04:44:18.948 --> 04:44:18.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:44:20.788 --> 04:44:20.798 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure what this i mean it's not
 
04:44:22.230 --> 04:44:22.240 align:start position:0%
like you're putting the hoover dam in
 
04:44:25.590 --> 04:44:25.600 align:start position:0%
there oh no so the danger to the hundred
 
04:44:28.708 --> 04:44:28.718 align:start position:0%
towns downstream
 
04:44:30.470 --> 04:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
how do you see that because i mean if
 
04:44:32.230 --> 04:44:32.240 align:start position:0%
it's at a normal level whatever level
 
04:44:33.430 --> 04:44:33.440 align:start position:0%
that is
 
04:44:35.430 --> 04:44:35.440 align:start position:0%
then that whatever came down is going to
 
04:44:35.440 --> 04:44:36.390 align:start position:0%
then that whatever came down is going to
be

04:44:36.390 --> 04:44:36.400 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:44:39.190 --> 04:44:39.200 align:start position:0%
at a normal amount of flow through there
 
04:44:39.200 --> 04:44:39.910 align:start position:0%
at a normal amount of flow through there
well

04:44:39.910 --> 04:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:44:41.990 --> 04:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
if we go with your 18-inch measurement
 
04:44:43.830 --> 04:44:43.840 align:start position:0%
you would just mention it let me just by
 
04:44:45.270 --> 04:44:45.280 align:start position:0%
looking at the picture i know and that
 
04:44:47.190 --> 04:44:47.200 align:start position:0%
was that was a proposal that i i think
 
04:44:48.868 --> 04:44:48.878 align:start position:0%
they're thinking about
 
04:44:48.878 --> 04:44:50.150 align:start position:0%
they're thinking about
um

04:44:50.150 --> 04:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:52.070 --> 04:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
even if it's six or eight inches if you
 
04:44:53.350 --> 04:44:53.360 align:start position:0%
if you
 
04:44:56.390 --> 04:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
take the size of that pond which i'm not
 
04:44:59.830 --> 04:44:59.840 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking 70 80 acres it's it's big
 
04:45:01.670 --> 04:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
and you multiply that by six inches of
 
04:45:04.310 --> 04:45:04.320 align:start position:0%
depth of water and that board breaks and
 
04:45:06.470 --> 04:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
that all goes at one time
 
04:45:09.430 --> 04:45:09.440 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of water
 
04:45:11.510 --> 04:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
it would you know
 
04:45:13.590 --> 04:45:13.600 align:start position:0%
that's obviously worse case scenario but
 
04:45:15.270 --> 04:45:15.280 align:start position:0%
i'm just saying it's potential could
 
04:45:16.788 --> 04:45:16.798 align:start position:0%
happen i think
 
04:45:18.788 --> 04:45:18.798 align:start position:0%
we really need to
 
04:45:20.550 --> 04:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
study this a lot more
 
04:45:22.708 --> 04:45:22.718 align:start position:0%
before we jump into putting a dam there
 
04:45:29.590 --> 04:45:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:31.350 --> 04:45:31.360 align:start position:0%
uh representative smith
 
04:45:32.788 --> 04:45:32.798 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
04:45:34.628 --> 04:45:34.638 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:45:35.990 --> 04:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
um when
 
04:45:40.070 --> 04:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh mr doyen doyen spoke from uh
 
04:45:42.230 --> 04:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
des the dam bureau
 
04:45:45.510 --> 04:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
he stated that most likely
 
04:45:45.520 --> 04:45:46.708 align:start position:0%
he stated that most likely
this

04:45:46.708 --> 04:45:46.718 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:45:50.310 --> 04:45:50.320 align:start position:0%
project would require a management plan
 
04:45:51.990 --> 04:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
would that make you feel any more
 
04:45:54.070 --> 04:45:54.080 align:start position:0%
comfortable i'm not exactly sure what a
 
04:45:56.150 --> 04:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
management plan would entail but would
 
04:45:58.310 --> 04:45:58.320 align:start position:0%
that make you feel like things were
 
04:45:59.990 --> 04:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
going in a good direction and all the
 
04:46:02.788 --> 04:46:02.798 align:start position:0%
permitting would have to happen too
 
04:46:03.830 --> 04:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
i think
 
04:46:06.070 --> 04:46:06.080 align:start position:0%
well possibly but i think what really
 
04:46:07.990 --> 04:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
needs to happen is a study would need to
 
04:46:09.510 --> 04:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
be done
 
04:46:09.520 --> 04:46:10.868 align:start position:0%
be done
on

04:46:10.868 --> 04:46:10.878 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:46:12.788 --> 04:46:12.798 align:start position:0%
at least the septic system situation
 
04:46:15.030 --> 04:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
around the pond um
 
04:46:17.030 --> 04:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
every there's a lot of houses
 
04:46:19.030 --> 04:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
lake level or just you know three feet
 
04:46:20.948 --> 04:46:20.958 align:start position:0%
above lake level let's say that have
 
04:46:23.030 --> 04:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
older septic systems
 
04:46:25.830 --> 04:46:25.840 align:start position:0%
and i i i know the current law requires
 
04:46:27.670 --> 04:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
you to have four feet of
 
04:46:27.680 --> 04:46:28.708 align:start position:0%
you to have four feet of
um

04:46:28.708 --> 04:46:28.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:46:30.470 --> 04:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
depth in your sept in your leech field
 
04:46:32.070 --> 04:46:32.080 align:start position:0%
to a water table
 
04:46:33.670 --> 04:46:33.680 align:start position:0%
and many of them don't even have that
 
04:46:33.680 --> 04:46:34.708 align:start position:0%
and many of them don't even have that
now

04:46:34.708 --> 04:46:34.718 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:46:35.830 --> 04:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
if we
 
04:46:37.750 --> 04:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
constantly keep that water level there
 
04:46:39.190 --> 04:46:39.200 align:start position:0%
where don't let it go down in the summer
 
04:46:41.430 --> 04:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
don't let stuff drain down we're asking
 
04:46:44.070 --> 04:46:44.080 align:start position:0%
for leachate to go into the pond and
 
04:46:47.270 --> 04:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:52.230 --> 04:46:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:54.788 --> 04:46:54.798 align:start position:0%

thank you for taking my question i'm
 
04:48:01.910 --> 04:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
just curious as a homeowner there you're
 
04:48:05.030 --> 04:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
a it's a two-part question so follow are
 
04:48:07.190 --> 04:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
you a year-round homeowner
 
04:48:09.590 --> 04:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
and if so what happens in the summer
 
04:48:09.600 --> 04:48:20.070 align:start position:0%
and if so what happens in the summer
recreation

04:48:20.070 --> 04:48:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:21.830 --> 04:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
your question on the second part of that
 
04:48:21.840 --> 04:48:22.550 align:start position:0%
your question on the second part of that
so

04:48:22.550 --> 04:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:48:23.990 --> 04:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
could you speak into the microphone
 
04:48:24.000 --> 04:48:24.788 align:start position:0%
could you speak into the microphone
please

04:48:24.788 --> 04:48:24.798 align:start position:0%
please
 
04:48:26.708 --> 04:48:26.718 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i didn't understand the second
 
04:48:28.708 --> 04:48:28.718 align:start position:0%
part of that question
 
04:48:30.708 --> 04:48:30.718 align:start position:0%
yeah both of you so
 
04:48:33.110 --> 04:48:33.120 align:start position:0%
can you hear me okay now uh excuse me
 
04:48:34.470 --> 04:48:34.480 align:start position:0%
representative post please shut off your
 
04:48:34.480 --> 04:48:36.070 align:start position:0%
representative post please shut off your
mic

04:48:36.070 --> 04:48:36.080 align:start position:0%
mic
 
04:48:38.070 --> 04:48:38.080 align:start position:0%
and me
 
04:48:40.390 --> 04:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
second part of the question was
 
04:48:43.430 --> 04:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming that a a large part of the
 
04:48:46.390 --> 04:48:46.400 align:start position:0%
recreation of living on that pond is
 
04:48:48.470 --> 04:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
summer related activity
 
04:48:51.430 --> 04:48:51.440 align:start position:0%
and how will a dam being installed
 
04:48:51.440 --> 04:48:52.708 align:start position:0%
and how will a dam being installed
negatively

04:48:52.708 --> 04:48:52.718 align:start position:0%
negatively
 
04:48:55.750 --> 04:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
affect your summer enjoyment and others
 
04:48:59.030 --> 04:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
homeowners summer enjoyment of the pond
 
04:49:01.030 --> 04:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
as far as recreation i don't suppose it
 
04:49:01.040 --> 04:49:02.310 align:start position:0%
as far as recreation i don't suppose it
would

04:49:02.310 --> 04:49:02.320 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:49:02.320 --> 04:49:03.670 align:start position:0%
would
but

04:49:03.670 --> 04:49:03.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:49:03.680 --> 04:49:04.868 align:start position:0%
but
i

04:49:04.868 --> 04:49:04.878 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:49:07.910 --> 04:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier i think scientifically
 
04:49:12.390 --> 04:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:14.550 --> 04:49:14.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:49:16.948 --> 04:49:16.958 align:start position:0%

uh
 
04:49:38.150 --> 04:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:42.230 --> 04:49:42.240 align:start position:0%

04:49:52.868 --> 04:49:52.878 align:start position:0%
i've got a photograph here if i could
 
04:49:54.390 --> 04:49:54.400 align:start position:0%
show you guys
 
04:49:55.830 --> 04:49:55.840 align:start position:0%
you get a different perspective of the
 
04:50:01.110 --> 04:50:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:02.470 --> 04:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
you can see the mountains in the back

04:50:09.200 --> 04:50:10.628 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:50:10.628 --> 04:50:10.638 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:50:12.788 --> 04:50:12.798 align:start position:0%
i represent a
 
04:50:14.948 --> 04:50:14.958 align:start position:0%
1200 feet of frontage on the north shore
 
04:50:18.070 --> 04:50:18.080 align:start position:0%
of the pond and 50 acres on the slope
 
04:50:20.230 --> 04:50:20.240 align:start position:0%
here coming in with two hydrox streams
 
04:50:22.310 --> 04:50:22.320 align:start position:0%
coming into the pond
 
04:50:22.320 --> 04:50:23.030 align:start position:0%
coming into the pond
and

04:50:23.030 --> 04:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:50:25.030 --> 04:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
this area here
 
04:50:28.150 --> 04:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
is the literal zone on this side the
 
04:50:30.708 --> 04:50:30.718 align:start position:0%

larger fish eat
 
04:50:40.948 --> 04:50:40.958 align:start position:0%
so when that water has been drained the
 
04:50:44.470 --> 04:50:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:48.230 --> 04:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
the uh the water has receded at the
 
04:50:51.110 --> 04:50:51.120 align:start position:0%
wrong time on an irregular basis it has
 
04:50:53.990 --> 04:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
killed all of the egg nesting
 
04:50:56.470 --> 04:50:56.480 align:start position:0%
along this shore that i see i visually
 
04:50:56.480 --> 04:50:57.270 align:start position:0%
along this shore that i see i visually
see

04:50:57.270 --> 04:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
see
 
04:51:00.470 --> 04:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
so the pond is in dire straits as of the
 
04:51:02.390 --> 04:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
last 10 years
 
04:51:03.670 --> 04:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
at one point
 
04:51:05.510 --> 04:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
we have an ice fishing derby they're
 
04:51:08.470 --> 04:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
catching little fish like this
 
04:51:08.480 --> 04:51:09.510 align:start position:0%
catching little fish like this
okay

04:51:09.510 --> 04:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:51:12.150 --> 04:51:12.160 align:start position:0%
ten years ago the kids were bringing me
 
04:51:14.708 --> 04:51:14.718 align:start position:0%
fish with bellies hanging down in the
 
04:51:14.718 --> 04:51:15.910 align:start position:0%
fish with bellies hanging down in the
middle

04:51:15.910 --> 04:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
middle
 
04:51:17.190 --> 04:51:17.200 align:start position:0%
tow trout
 
04:51:19.190 --> 04:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
that aren't in there anymore so the
 
04:51:22.230 --> 04:51:22.240 align:start position:0%
fishery i have visually seen
 
04:51:23.430 --> 04:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
drop down
 
04:51:26.470 --> 04:51:26.480 align:start position:0%
i do manage the loons on big p porch
 
04:51:28.550 --> 04:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
we have not had a chick
 
04:51:30.390 --> 04:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
in eight years
 
04:51:32.390 --> 04:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
we had an egg last year it was predated
 
04:51:35.510 --> 04:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
but that fluctuation of that drawdown of
 
04:51:37.750 --> 04:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
the water from the other ponds south of
 
04:51:37.760 --> 04:51:39.030 align:start position:0%
the water from the other ponds south of
us

04:51:39.030 --> 04:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
us
 
04:51:41.430 --> 04:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
not coordinated with anybody
 
04:51:44.470 --> 04:51:44.480 align:start position:0%
has affected our loon nest we do we did
 
04:51:46.868 --> 04:51:46.878 align:start position:0%
try a floating raft just to
 
04:51:48.788 --> 04:51:48.798 align:start position:0%
mitigate that but there are many
 
04:51:50.628 --> 04:51:50.638 align:start position:0%
problems with
 
04:51:52.470 --> 04:51:52.480 align:start position:0%
that water level coming up and down
 
04:51:54.310 --> 04:51:54.320 align:start position:0%
coming up and down and is
 
04:51:56.230 --> 04:51:56.240 align:start position:0%
that's the key i think the dam
 
04:51:58.868 --> 04:51:58.878 align:start position:0%
management is the key to this problem
 
04:52:00.948 --> 04:52:00.958 align:start position:0%
on the idlewise side they're not
 
04:52:03.510 --> 04:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
coordinating anything with us so you can
 
04:52:05.990 --> 04:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
see the great pond here
 
04:52:07.510 --> 04:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
the middle pond and there's the little
 
04:52:10.948 --> 04:52:10.958 align:start position:0%
dam on this farther over there they're
 
04:52:12.868 --> 04:52:12.878 align:start position:0%
lowering that level but they're really
 
04:52:15.350 --> 04:52:15.360 align:start position:0%
lowering our level here and this affects
 
04:52:17.910 --> 04:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
major watershed
 
04:52:19.430 --> 04:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
and the other thing is yeah we are a
 
04:52:21.030 --> 04:52:21.040 align:start position:0%
summer recreation
 
04:52:22.628 --> 04:52:22.638 align:start position:0%
i've met people from all over the
 
04:52:24.150 --> 04:52:24.160 align:start position:0%
country and all over the world on the
 
04:52:26.150 --> 04:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
pond in 30 years
 
04:52:28.788 --> 04:52:28.798 align:start position:0%
that pond was down you did we have a
 
04:52:31.430 --> 04:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
boat ramp without a state boat ramp to
 
04:52:33.670 --> 04:52:33.680 align:start position:0%
get your boat back in
 
04:52:35.830 --> 04:52:35.840 align:start position:0%
you can't get a boat in
 
04:52:37.590 --> 04:52:37.600 align:start position:0%
and there was a there actually there was
 
04:52:39.350 --> 04:52:39.360 align:start position:0%
a rescue i was involved in of the 80
 
04:52:41.190 --> 04:52:41.200 align:start position:0%
year old man in a boat they couldn't get
 
04:52:43.590 --> 04:52:43.600 align:start position:0%
the fire department couldn't get the
 
04:52:45.350 --> 04:52:45.360 align:start position:0%
raft in because that water had been
 
04:52:47.350 --> 04:52:47.360 align:start position:0%
drawn down and it never
 
04:52:49.510 --> 04:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
once that water gets drawn down at that
 
04:52:51.510 --> 04:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
time for the other ponds it never
 
04:52:54.230 --> 04:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
recoups for the whole season so this in
 
04:52:56.070 --> 04:52:56.080 align:start position:0%
this past decade it's been a very
 
04:52:56.080 --> 04:52:59.110 align:start position:0%
this past decade it's been a very
drastic

04:52:59.110 --> 04:52:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:10.948 --> 04:53:10.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:14.470 --> 04:53:14.480 align:start position:0%
is that your testimony yes okay
 
04:53:16.708 --> 04:53:16.718 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
04:53:20.310 --> 04:53:20.320 align:start position:0%
of the speakers
 
04:53:22.070 --> 04:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
04:53:23.430 --> 04:53:23.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
04:53:25.670 --> 04:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:53:31.510 --> 04:53:31.520 align:start position:0%
uh who who is responsible for the damn
 
04:53:34.868 --> 04:53:34.878 align:start position:0%
uh the damn levels changing in the dam
 
04:53:37.030 --> 04:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
that is presently
 
04:53:39.270 --> 04:53:39.280 align:start position:0%
distance the village district of idol
 
04:53:42.310 --> 04:53:42.320 align:start position:0%
wise which owns two ponds that are not
 
04:53:45.030 --> 04:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
state ponds in their district it was
 
04:53:47.590 --> 04:53:47.600 align:start position:0%
started as a vacation home
 
04:53:50.070 --> 04:53:50.080 align:start position:0%
place back in the 70s
 
04:53:52.628 --> 04:53:52.638 align:start position:0%
our big pond connects to theirs
 
04:53:56.230 --> 04:53:56.240 align:start position:0%
so there are two uneducated people a
 
04:53:58.788 --> 04:53:58.798 align:start position:0%
road maintenance man and a commissioner
 
04:54:01.670 --> 04:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
who has who has great interest in his
 
04:54:04.230 --> 04:54:04.240 align:start position:0%
loon at his house which had a camera on
 
04:54:05.670 --> 04:54:05.680 align:start position:0%
which has been taken off by loon
 
04:54:05.680 --> 04:54:06.948 align:start position:0%
which has been taken off by loon
preservation

04:54:06.948 --> 04:54:06.958 align:start position:0%
preservation
 
04:54:09.670 --> 04:54:09.680 align:start position:0%
so at his whim
 
04:54:11.670 --> 04:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
he would take the boards out of the dam
 
04:54:12.948 --> 04:54:12.958 align:start position:0%
at the
 
04:54:14.628 --> 04:54:14.638 align:start position:0%
damn flow
 
04:54:16.788 --> 04:54:16.798 align:start position:0%
i have visually seen it
 
04:54:19.350 --> 04:54:19.360 align:start position:0%
happen when those boards go out our lake
 
04:54:21.830 --> 04:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
goes down and then it never quite
 
04:54:21.840 --> 04:54:24.070 align:start position:0%
goes down and then it never quite
recoups

04:54:24.070 --> 04:54:24.080 align:start position:0%
recoups
 
04:54:27.190 --> 04:54:27.200 align:start position:0%
once they do that so they're not
 
04:54:28.948 --> 04:54:28.958 align:start position:0%
there it's kind of like a wild west
 
04:54:30.948 --> 04:54:30.958 align:start position:0%
situation they're not
 
04:54:33.110 --> 04:54:33.120 align:start position:0%
they're doing it at their whim
 
04:54:36.550 --> 04:54:36.560 align:start position:0%
that has been our major problem
 
04:54:41.350 --> 04:54:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:43.030 --> 04:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
president creighton
 
04:54:44.390 --> 04:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
thank you sir i'm sorry i appreciate
 
04:54:46.310 --> 04:54:46.320 align:start position:0%
your testimony we've heard testimony
 
04:54:46.320 --> 04:54:47.670 align:start position:0%
your testimony we've heard testimony
that

04:54:47.670 --> 04:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:54:49.430 --> 04:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
putting a dam in would endanger
 
04:54:51.510 --> 04:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
downstream based on the
 
04:54:56.230 --> 04:54:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:57.910 --> 04:54:57.920 align:start position:0%
that people have not been informed about
 
04:55:00.470 --> 04:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
this and it hasn't gone through
 
04:55:01.910 --> 04:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
a process
 
04:55:01.920 --> 04:55:02.708 align:start position:0%
a process
and

04:55:02.708 --> 04:55:02.718 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:55:02.718 --> 04:55:03.910 align:start position:0%
and
and

04:55:03.910 --> 04:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:55:05.430 --> 04:55:05.440 align:start position:0%
that there are other challenges how
 
04:55:08.788 --> 04:55:08.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:10.788 --> 04:55:10.798 align:start position:0%
the lay of the land and the slope of the
 
04:55:14.150 --> 04:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
land is so mild that it would
 
04:55:17.030 --> 04:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
probably take a tsunami to cause any
 
04:55:19.750 --> 04:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
damage which is highly unlikely
 
04:55:22.310 --> 04:55:22.320 align:start position:0%
and there is plenty it is not it is not
 
04:55:24.628 --> 04:55:24.638 align:start position:0%
like it's a narrow canyon from the
 
04:55:26.628 --> 04:55:26.638 align:start position:0%
outflow of the great pond into the
 
04:55:29.190 --> 04:55:29.200 align:start position:0%
middle it's it's very
 
04:55:31.430 --> 04:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
spread out like a parking lot there
 
04:55:32.788 --> 04:55:32.798 align:start position:0%
there are trees or woods in there but
 
04:55:35.670 --> 04:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
it's it's a flowing valley so it's not a
 
04:55:38.150 --> 04:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
pitched canyon like you'd see
 
04:55:40.708 --> 04:55:40.718 align:start position:0%
you know in the american west where
 
04:55:43.190 --> 04:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
everything just comes down at once so
 
04:55:45.430 --> 04:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
if there was ever and we've had heavy
 
04:55:48.070 --> 04:55:48.080 align:start position:0%
rains and i i've there's never been been
 
04:55:50.550 --> 04:55:50.560 align:start position:0%
a problem that i have seen
 
04:55:58.310 --> 04:55:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:00.628 --> 04:56:00.638 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
04:56:02.550 --> 04:56:02.560 align:start position:0%
if not
 
04:56:03.990 --> 04:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you for your
 
04:56:04.000 --> 04:56:05.190 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you for your
time

04:56:05.190 --> 04:56:05.200 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:56:05.200 --> 04:56:07.350 align:start position:0%
time
okay

04:56:07.350 --> 04:56:07.360 align:start position:0%
okay

i just want to preface this with
 
04:56:32.070 --> 04:56:32.080 align:start position:0%
i am not an expert by any means i am not
 
04:56:34.708 --> 04:56:34.718 align:start position:0%
comfortable being in this position
 
04:56:38.070 --> 04:56:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:41.190 --> 04:56:41.200 align:start position:0%
i'm shauna conrad i'm a resident at
 
04:56:43.830 --> 04:56:43.840 align:start position:0%
89 first meadow road in madison i'm the
 
04:56:46.150 --> 04:56:46.160 align:start position:0%
current president of the big p porridge
 
04:56:48.390 --> 04:56:48.400 align:start position:0%
watershed preservation association which
 
04:56:51.030 --> 04:56:51.040 align:start position:0%
is a new hampshire registered 501c
 
04:56:54.470 --> 04:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
corporation with over 70 members
 
04:56:56.868 --> 04:56:56.878 align:start position:0%
that has been working since 2018 to
 
04:56:59.190 --> 04:56:59.200 align:start position:0%
protect improve and preserve the
 
04:57:01.110 --> 04:57:01.120 align:start position:0%
watershed and water quality of the lake
 
04:57:02.830 --> 04:57:02.840 align:start position:0%
to save its pristine
 
04:57:05.110 --> 04:57:05.120 align:start position:0%
beauty most recently we have been
 
04:57:07.030 --> 04:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
working to minimize road runoff from the
 
04:57:09.110 --> 04:57:09.120 align:start position:0%
steep dirt roads surrounding the pond
 
04:57:11.350 --> 04:57:11.360 align:start position:0%
that fills the inlet and has destroyed a
 
04:57:14.230 --> 04:57:14.240 align:start position:0%
working wetland which abuts my property
 
04:57:16.948 --> 04:57:16.958 align:start position:0%
my husband's property off allard hill

madison and conway
 
04:57:22.390 --> 04:57:22.400 align:start position:0%
we're working closely with rockhouse
 
04:57:24.708 --> 04:57:24.718 align:start position:0%
mountain homeowners association the new

and towns of madison and conway to
 
04:57:29.990 --> 04:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
address the
 
04:57:32.230 --> 04:57:32.240 align:start position:0%
situation in a rational scientifically
 
04:57:35.030 --> 04:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:37.510 --> 04:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
the members and board of the association
 
04:57:39.948 --> 04:57:39.958 align:start position:0%
became aware of the introduction of hb
 
04:57:42.550 --> 04:57:42.560 align:start position:0%
1532 a few days ago
 
04:57:44.550 --> 04:57:44.560 align:start position:0%
and only through an article in the
 
04:57:47.830 --> 04:57:47.840 align:start position:0%
conway daily sun we are not affiliated
 
04:57:50.390 --> 04:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
with the association referenced in hb
 
04:57:53.270 --> 04:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
1532 and we had no knowledge of its
 
04:57:53.280 --> 04:57:55.110 align:start position:0%
1532 and we had no knowledge of its
existence

04:57:55.110 --> 04:57:55.120 align:start position:0%
existence
 
04:57:56.470 --> 04:57:56.480 align:start position:0%
i'd just like to
 
04:57:57.750 --> 04:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
reference what
 
04:57:59.590 --> 04:57:59.600 align:start position:0%
representative mcconkey said earlier
 
04:58:02.230 --> 04:58:02.240 align:start position:0%
about he thought he had all this support
 
04:58:03.590 --> 04:58:03.600 align:start position:0%
and then suddenly there was an article
 
04:58:05.750 --> 04:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
in the paper and things changed that's
 
04:58:09.670 --> 04:58:09.680 align:start position:0%
because none of us knew about this
 
04:58:12.390 --> 04:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:14.868 --> 04:58:14.878 align:start position:0%
now this new association which is formed
 
04:58:16.948 --> 04:58:16.958 align:start position:0%
by five people has taken these steps
 
04:58:18.550 --> 04:58:18.560 align:start position:0%
despite the fact that there are
 
04:58:20.868 --> 04:58:20.878 align:start position:0%
approximately 70 waterfront homes on big
 
04:58:20.878 --> 04:58:22.230 align:start position:0%
approximately 70 waterfront homes on big
p

04:58:22.230 --> 04:58:22.240 align:start position:0%
p
 
04:58:25.510 --> 04:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
460 additional homes in idlewise and
 
04:58:28.070 --> 04:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
about 108 in raucous mountain homeowners
 
04:58:30.230 --> 04:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
association that all have rights to
 
04:58:31.990 --> 04:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
enjoy this pond
 
04:58:33.430 --> 04:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
the lack of transparency and
 
04:58:35.270 --> 04:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
communication with affected homeowners
 
04:58:38.150 --> 04:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
is extremely disturbing
 
04:58:39.990 --> 04:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
an initial analysis by our wetland
 
04:58:41.510 --> 04:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
experts has indicated that there are a
 
04:58:43.030 --> 04:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
number of questions regarding the
 
04:58:45.830 --> 04:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
impacts of a dam at the outlet of big p
 
04:58:47.510 --> 04:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
including questions about ongoing
 
04:58:49.750 --> 04:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
effects on fishing amphibians water
 
04:58:52.070 --> 04:58:52.080 align:start position:0%
quality grandfathered septic systems
 
04:58:54.708 --> 04:58:54.718 align:start position:0%
along the lakefront etc
 
04:58:56.150 --> 04:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
there has been no comprehensive
 
04:58:57.750 --> 04:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
professional ecological impact
 
04:58:59.590 --> 04:58:59.600 align:start position:0%
evaluation completed to assess these
 
04:58:59.600 --> 04:59:01.750 align:start position:0%
evaluation completed to assess these
issues

04:59:01.750 --> 04:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
issues
 
04:59:04.310 --> 04:59:04.320 align:start position:0%
big p porridge pond is a designated
 
04:59:06.230 --> 04:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
great pond owned by as you know the
 
04:59:07.590 --> 04:59:07.600 align:start position:0%
citizens of new hampshire in this
 
04:59:09.910 --> 04:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
legislation would authorize a select
 
04:59:11.990 --> 04:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
group of individuals individuals to
 
04:59:14.390 --> 04:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
build and operate a dam affecting the
 
04:59:16.390 --> 04:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
entire pond without professional
 
04:59:19.750 --> 04:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
understanding and oversight
 
04:59:22.150 --> 04:59:22.160 align:start position:0%
i find that disturbing regardless of
 
04:59:24.390 --> 04:59:24.400 align:start position:0%
perhaps the best intentions management
 
04:59:26.708 --> 04:59:26.718 align:start position:0%
downstream at the dam on little p as it
 
04:59:29.350 --> 04:59:29.360 align:start position:0%
has been discussed has revealed just how
 
04:59:30.868 --> 04:59:30.878 align:start position:0%
damaging to the environment such a
 
04:59:35.030 --> 04:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:37.110 --> 04:59:37.120 align:start position:0%
i am surprised i'm probably not supposed
 
04:59:39.030 --> 04:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
to say this
 
04:59:40.628 --> 04:59:40.638 align:start position:0%
i am surprised by the position this
 
04:59:43.910 --> 04:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
afternoon of the nhges who spoke earlier
 
04:59:46.628 --> 04:59:46.638 align:start position:0%
representative who spoke earlier
 
04:59:48.750 --> 04:59:48.760 align:start position:0%
because my understanding was
 
04:59:51.430 --> 04:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
nhdes has been trying to dismantle the
 
04:59:54.070 --> 04:59:54.080 align:start position:0%
dams there's about five thousand dams in
 
04:59:55.270 --> 04:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
04:59:57.430 --> 04:59:57.440 align:start position:0%
and they're working at taking
 
05:00:00.390 --> 05:00:00.400 align:start position:0%
some of them out not building new dams
 
05:00:02.788 --> 05:00:02.798 align:start position:0%
and i could be wrong
 
05:00:06.230 --> 05:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
but i i know the nhdes
 
05:00:08.150 --> 05:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
has a different opinion that was
 
05:00:09.510 --> 05:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
people there have a different opinion
 
05:00:11.910 --> 05:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
that was presented earlier
 
05:00:13.590 --> 05:00:13.600 align:start position:0%
in conclusion the big p porridge
 
05:00:15.990 --> 05:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
watershed preservation association
 
05:00:17.750 --> 05:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
recommends that this bill be classified
 
05:00:20.550 --> 05:00:20.560 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate and i thank you
 
05:00:22.310 --> 05:00:22.320 align:start position:0%
for your consideration and listening to
 
05:00:25.750 --> 05:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:27.590 --> 05:00:27.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:00:29.350 --> 05:00:29.360 align:start position:0%
is there any questions for members of
 
05:00:29.360 --> 05:00:30.390 align:start position:0%
is there any questions for members of
the

05:00:30.390 --> 05:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:00:30.400 --> 05:00:34.550 align:start position:0%
the
committee

05:00:34.550 --> 05:00:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:36.470 --> 05:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
05:00:37.910 --> 05:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
05:00:40.390 --> 05:00:40.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:00:41.910 --> 05:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
so you
 
05:00:43.990 --> 05:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
my understanding from what you just said
 
05:00:46.708 --> 05:00:46.718 align:start position:0%
is that you were on big p porridge pond
 
05:00:46.718 --> 05:00:47.670 align:start position:0%
is that you were on big p porridge pond
correct

05:00:47.670 --> 05:00:47.680 align:start position:0%
correct
 
05:00:50.230 --> 05:00:50.240 align:start position:0%
and those in favor are also on big p
 
05:00:54.470 --> 05:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:01.590 --> 05:01:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:03.510 --> 05:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
i guess thank you very much i don't see
 
05:01:05.350 --> 05:01:05.360 align:start position:0%
any other
 
05:01:06.868 --> 05:01:06.878 align:start position:0%
any other questions thank you very much
 
05:01:12.070 --> 05:01:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:15.190 --> 05:01:15.200 align:start position:0%
chair calls
 
05:01:19.510 --> 05:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
uh in support of the bill terry
 
05:01:19.520 --> 05:01:22.868 align:start position:0%
uh in support of the bill terry
cancellaric

05:01:22.868 --> 05:01:22.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:27.750 --> 05:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:28.830 --> 05:01:28.840 align:start position:0%
i learned
 
05:01:28.840 --> 05:01:30.390 align:start position:0%
i learned
fast

05:01:30.390 --> 05:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
fast
 
05:01:34.230 --> 05:01:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:36.390 --> 05:01:36.400 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much for um
 
05:01:37.830 --> 05:01:37.840 align:start position:0%
your attention and your time today i
 
05:01:41.270 --> 05:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:45.110 --> 05:01:45.120 align:start position:0%
the idlewise side drive of a big p has a
 
05:01:47.030 --> 05:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
more gradual slope
 
05:01:49.670 --> 05:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
to it than the allard hill side on the
 
05:01:51.430 --> 05:01:51.440 align:start position:0%
other side of the pond has which has a
 
05:01:54.628 --> 05:01:54.638 align:start position:0%
deeper you know a deeper a steeper slope
 
05:01:56.550 --> 05:01:56.560 align:start position:0%
so the impact of declining water levels
 
05:01:58.868 --> 05:01:58.878 align:start position:0%
is more direct more dramatic on the
 
05:02:00.628 --> 05:02:00.638 align:start position:0%
gradual slope side
 
05:02:03.350 --> 05:02:03.360 align:start position:0%
our neighbor wooda mcniven fixes a
 
05:02:05.830 --> 05:02:05.840 align:start position:0%
yardstick to his dock so we can observe
 
05:02:07.750 --> 05:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
the decline in water levels in the
 
05:02:07.760 --> 05:02:09.030 align:start position:0%
the decline in water levels in the
spring

05:02:09.030 --> 05:02:09.040 align:start position:0%
spring
 
05:02:10.868 --> 05:02:10.878 align:start position:0%
a two inch decline in water levels
 
05:02:13.590 --> 05:02:13.600 align:start position:0%
results in a foot of extra shore
 
05:02:15.990 --> 05:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
so you can see if we lose six to eight
 
05:02:19.110 --> 05:02:19.120 align:start position:0%
or even as much as 10 inches of the
 
05:02:21.030 --> 05:02:21.040 align:start position:0%
snowmelt and the runoff
 
05:02:23.910 --> 05:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
we the waters recede dramatically and
 
05:02:28.310 --> 05:02:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:30.070 --> 05:02:30.080 align:start position:0%
i'm also speaking on behalf of lindsay
 
05:02:32.390 --> 05:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
wedge her family has owned a house on
 
05:02:35.510 --> 05:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
big p for close to 30 years
 
05:02:35.520 --> 05:02:36.390 align:start position:0%
big p for close to 30 years
she

05:02:36.390 --> 05:02:36.400 align:start position:0%
she
 
05:02:38.708 --> 05:02:38.718 align:start position:0%
up until recently was a specialist at
 
05:02:41.030 --> 05:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
the new england aquarium
 
05:02:43.510 --> 05:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
her husband is an expert in the fishes
 
05:02:46.070 --> 05:02:46.080 align:start position:0%
department at the new england aquarium
 
05:02:47.990 --> 05:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
she spoke at our monday meeting and she
 
05:02:49.590 --> 05:02:49.600 align:start position:0%
has spoken in the past to the village
 
05:02:51.830 --> 05:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
district of idaho weiss's commissioners
 
05:02:52.948 --> 05:02:52.958 align:start position:0%
at their
 
05:02:55.430 --> 05:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
damn management meeting
 
05:02:58.390 --> 05:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
damn management policy meetings um she
 
05:02:59.830 --> 05:02:59.840 align:start position:0%
is for this damn i don't want to speak
 
05:03:01.830 --> 05:03:01.840 align:start position:0%
for her but she is
 
05:03:03.430 --> 05:03:03.440 align:start position:0%
she gave me some slides that you'll see
 
05:03:05.830 --> 05:03:05.840 align:start position:0%
in here this one that says impacting
 
05:03:07.270 --> 05:03:07.280 align:start position:0%
from just the impact from disturbing
 
05:03:09.190 --> 05:03:09.200 align:start position:0%
water levels these were supplied by
 
05:03:10.868 --> 05:03:10.878 align:start position:0%
lindsay so i'm going to
 
05:03:12.470 --> 05:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
read from the notes that she provided to
 
05:03:12.480 --> 05:03:13.750 align:start position:0%
read from the notes that she provided to
me

05:03:13.750 --> 05:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
me
 
05:03:15.510 --> 05:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
and it's about the impact of the water
 
05:03:18.310 --> 05:03:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:19.910 --> 05:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
so fluctuating water levels on the
 
05:03:21.910 --> 05:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
lakeshore and on the literal zone the
 
05:03:23.350 --> 05:03:23.360 align:start position:0%
littoral zone is the area from the
 
05:03:25.670 --> 05:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
lakeshore out to about 15 feet depth of
 
05:03:25.680 --> 05:03:26.788 align:start position:0%
lakeshore out to about 15 feet depth of
water

05:03:26.788 --> 05:03:26.798 align:start position:0%
water
 
05:03:28.310 --> 05:03:28.320 align:start position:0%
this area
 
05:03:31.190 --> 05:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
is vital to a pond it's prime breeding
 
05:03:33.190 --> 05:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
and nesting grounds for fish amphibians
 
05:03:35.590 --> 05:03:35.600 align:start position:0%
and other wildlife many fish inhabit the
 
05:03:37.030 --> 05:03:37.040 align:start position:0%
literal zone
 
05:03:39.350 --> 05:03:39.360 align:start position:0%
for part of if not their entire life
 
05:03:41.510 --> 05:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
cycle the species in these zones have
 
05:03:43.990 --> 05:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
evolved to the natural cycles of water
 
05:03:46.230 --> 05:03:46.240 align:start position:0%
level fluctuations artificial
 
05:03:48.550 --> 05:03:48.560 align:start position:0%
fluctuations however create stress on
 
05:03:51.750 --> 05:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
those species and on the entire biome
 
05:03:53.990 --> 05:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
when the literal zone is disrupted and
 
05:03:56.628 --> 05:03:56.638 align:start position:0%
again that's from the shore 15 feet out
 
05:03:58.310 --> 05:03:58.320 align:start position:0%
it decreases the availability of
 
05:03:59.910 --> 05:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
adequate habitat
 
05:04:01.910 --> 05:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
disrupts organisms that are spawning
 
05:04:04.150 --> 05:04:04.160 align:start position:0%
nesting and occupying that zone and
 
05:04:06.708 --> 05:04:06.718 align:start position:0%
increases the mortality rate
 
05:04:08.788 --> 05:04:08.798 align:start position:0%
every spring just as those or just when
 
05:04:11.350 --> 05:04:11.360 align:start position:0%
those organ organisms are spawning and
 
05:04:14.628 --> 05:04:14.638 align:start position:0%
nesting the vdoe pulls two
 
05:04:16.390 --> 05:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
10 inch boards
 
05:04:19.910 --> 05:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
from the dam at little p excuse me
 
05:04:22.150 --> 05:04:22.160 align:start position:0%
causing big p to lose most of that snow
 
05:04:24.230 --> 05:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
melt and run off
 
05:04:26.708 --> 05:04:26.718 align:start position:0%
please turn to the one that says if you
 
05:04:27.750 --> 05:04:27.760 align:start position:0%
if you have it in front of you the
 
05:04:30.470 --> 05:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
picture says a million words
 
05:04:32.310 --> 05:04:32.320 align:start position:0%
okay the pitcher to the left is of the
 
05:04:34.550 --> 05:04:34.560 align:start position:0%
shoreline on an undeveloped lot next to
 
05:04:35.750 --> 05:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
our house
 
05:04:38.470 --> 05:04:38.480 align:start position:0%
prior to the drawdown the water reaches
 
05:04:41.590 --> 05:04:41.600 align:start position:0%
to the left edge of that pitcher
 
05:04:44.470 --> 05:04:44.480 align:start position:0%
as the water recedes the aquatic plants
 
05:04:48.150 --> 05:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:49.750 --> 05:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
the middle pitcher is of the shoreline
 
05:04:51.910 --> 05:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
that's approximately 300 feet down from
 
05:04:53.750 --> 05:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
the first pitcher and is taken from our
 
05:04:55.030 --> 05:04:55.040 align:start position:0%
neighbor's dock
 
05:04:56.390 --> 05:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
those rocks
 
05:04:57.990 --> 05:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
are usually underwater before the
 
05:04:58.000 --> 05:04:59.670 align:start position:0%
are usually underwater before the
drawdown

05:04:59.670 --> 05:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
drawdown
 
05:05:01.750 --> 05:05:01.760 align:start position:0%
those residents the mcnivens have been
 
05:05:04.868 --> 05:05:04.878 align:start position:0%
on the pond for close to 40 years
 
05:05:05.910 --> 05:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
the picture on the right is the
 
05:05:07.990 --> 05:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
shoreline in front of our house most of
 
05:05:10.230 --> 05:05:10.240 align:start position:0%
it's usually under water
 
05:05:12.948 --> 05:05:12.958 align:start position:0%
you'll see that it's not we often see
 
05:05:15.190 --> 05:05:15.200 align:start position:0%
fish nest among those plants that are
 
05:05:17.430 --> 05:05:17.440 align:start position:0%
now on dry grant dry ground
 
05:05:19.510 --> 05:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
and we have watched often
 
05:05:21.190 --> 05:05:21.200 align:start position:0%
watch some of those fish struggle as the
 
05:05:22.788 --> 05:05:22.798 align:start position:0%
water recedes
 
05:05:25.030 --> 05:05:25.040 align:start position:0%
lower water levels also results in
 
05:05:27.990 --> 05:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
warmer warmer warmer water temperature
 
05:05:29.910 --> 05:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
which encourages algae and bacteria
 
05:05:32.310 --> 05:05:32.320 align:start position:0%
growth when the algae dies it decomposes
 
05:05:34.390 --> 05:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
and consumes oxygen dissolved that's
 
05:05:35.990 --> 05:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
been dissolved in the water and needed
 
05:05:37.830 --> 05:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
by fish and other aquatic life to
 
05:05:37.840 --> 05:05:38.868 align:start position:0%
by fish and other aquatic life to
breathe

05:05:38.868 --> 05:05:38.878 align:start position:0%
breathe
 
05:05:41.110 --> 05:05:41.120 align:start position:0%
if enough oxygen is removed so that area
 
05:05:43.670 --> 05:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
cannot sustain life you have a dead zone
 
05:05:43.680 --> 05:05:45.270 align:start position:0%
cannot sustain life you have a dead zone
occur

05:05:45.270 --> 05:05:45.280 align:start position:0%
occur
 
05:05:46.868 --> 05:05:46.878 align:start position:0%
now rather than a gradual decline in the
 
05:05:48.708 --> 05:05:48.718 align:start position:0%
accumulated snowmelt and runoff over the
 
05:05:50.708 --> 05:05:50.718 align:start position:0%
course of several months which you would
 
05:05:53.190 --> 05:05:53.200 align:start position:0%
have if there wasn't a dam at little p
 
05:05:55.270 --> 05:05:55.280 align:start position:0%
the drawdown in late april may causes
 
05:05:57.670 --> 05:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
big p to fall to its lowest possible
 
05:05:59.670 --> 05:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
point when the water flowing through the
 
05:06:01.110 --> 05:06:01.120 align:start position:0%
banford brook
 
05:06:03.750 --> 05:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
can slows considerably just as it heads
 
05:06:07.110 --> 05:06:07.120 align:start position:0%
into the hottest driest months
 
05:06:09.270 --> 05:06:09.280 align:start position:0%
of the year when natural evaporation is
 
05:06:10.948 --> 05:06:10.958 align:start position:0%
at its highest and rainfall is at its
 
05:06:14.150 --> 05:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
lowest in the time of drought
 
05:06:16.628 --> 05:06:16.638 align:start position:0%
the shore can look like this
 
05:06:18.550 --> 05:06:18.560 align:start position:0%
this is the high water mark
 
05:06:27.510 --> 05:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:29.990 --> 05:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
again the high water mark is right there
 
05:06:39.670 --> 05:06:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:41.270 --> 05:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
the porridge ponds used to be teeming
 
05:06:45.430 --> 05:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:48.150 --> 05:06:48.160 align:start position:0%
if you turn to the next uh wait
 
05:06:50.948 --> 05:06:50.958 align:start position:0%
sorry before you'll see my cute kid
 
05:06:53.830 --> 05:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
holding a bullfrog pollywog in a plastic
 
05:06:55.670 --> 05:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
container now
 
05:06:56.868 --> 05:06:56.878 align:start position:0%
he was really cute then now he's a
 
05:06:59.430 --> 05:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
teenager and 17. um
 
05:07:01.350 --> 05:07:01.360 align:start position:0%
so do you used to be teeming with these
 
05:07:04.310 --> 05:07:04.320 align:start position:0%
large bullfrog tadpoles in the spring
 
05:07:06.310 --> 05:07:06.320 align:start position:0%
and for some time frog now for some time
 
05:07:08.070 --> 05:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
frog populations actually have been on
 
05:07:09.910 --> 05:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
the decline in many areas for unknown
 
05:07:12.550 --> 05:07:12.560 align:start position:0%
reasons but climate change land develop
 
05:07:14.788 --> 05:07:14.798 align:start position:0%
are factors but the frogs on big p
 
05:07:16.788 --> 05:07:16.798 align:start position:0%
didn't disappear gradually
 
05:07:18.070 --> 05:07:18.080 align:start position:0%
one year they were there the next year
 
05:07:22.550 --> 05:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:23.750 --> 05:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
what happened
 
05:07:25.190 --> 05:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
the board of commissioners acknowledged
 
05:07:27.830 --> 05:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
at the august dam policy meeting that
 
05:07:30.070 --> 05:07:30.080 align:start position:0%
the previous board of commissioners
 
05:07:31.910 --> 05:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
didn't know that there was a fish and
 
05:07:34.310 --> 05:07:34.320 align:start position:0%
game guideline that advised
 
05:07:37.270 --> 05:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
fishing finishing fall drawdowns before
 
05:07:39.270 --> 05:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
october 15th
 
05:07:41.350 --> 05:07:41.360 align:start position:0%
in order to protect hibernating
 
05:07:43.190 --> 05:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
amphibians that had boiled in the
 
05:07:46.788 --> 05:07:46.798 align:start position:0%
substrate in 2015 2016 i don't know the
 
05:07:48.868 --> 05:07:48.878 align:start position:0%
precise year was one of those there was
 
05:07:50.788 --> 05:07:50.798 align:start position:0%
a very late and significant fall
 
05:07:50.798 --> 05:07:52.310 align:start position:0%
a very late and significant fall
drawdown

05:07:52.310 --> 05:07:52.320 align:start position:0%
drawdown
 
05:07:54.230 --> 05:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
it froze the substrate
 
05:07:56.470 --> 05:07:56.480 align:start position:0%
and killed the frogs the frogs now are
 
05:07:58.550 --> 05:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
slowly beginning to recover but its
 
05:08:00.390 --> 05:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
numbers are still far short of what they
 
05:08:05.590 --> 05:08:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:06.708 --> 05:08:06.718 align:start position:0%
this brings me to the board of
 
05:08:06.718 --> 05:08:09.910 align:start position:0%
this brings me to the board of
commissioners

05:08:09.910 --> 05:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:12.070 --> 05:08:12.080 align:start position:0%
there have been six different boards in
 
05:08:13.670 --> 05:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
six years
 
05:08:16.150 --> 05:08:16.160 align:start position:0%
there'll be a seventh board in march
 
05:08:19.110 --> 05:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
there'll be an eighth board next year
 
05:08:20.708 --> 05:08:20.718 align:start position:0%
often there's a new dam management
 
05:08:23.430 --> 05:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
policy put in place by the new board
 
05:08:25.190 --> 05:08:25.200 align:start position:0%
there was last year
 
05:08:27.270 --> 05:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
it's rare that a policy is followed but
 
05:08:29.030 --> 05:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
it's hard to know if it's being followed
 
05:08:30.948 --> 05:08:30.958 align:start position:0%
because no log is kept
 
05:08:33.030 --> 05:08:33.040 align:start position:0%
of the removal and replacement of the
 
05:08:36.470 --> 05:08:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:38.470 --> 05:08:38.480 align:start position:0%
the dpw removed a 10 inch board in
 
05:08:41.030 --> 05:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
december this past december because of
 
05:08:43.430 --> 05:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
ice jams at little p
 
05:08:45.590 --> 05:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
they informed the dam bureau who okayed
 
05:08:47.510 --> 05:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
the release of water conditioned that
 
05:08:49.590 --> 05:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
the 10 inch board be replaced with a
 
05:08:51.030 --> 05:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
six-inch board
 
05:08:53.350 --> 05:08:53.360 align:start position:0%
it is now late january and that has yet
 
05:08:55.110 --> 05:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
to be done
 
05:08:57.990 --> 05:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
now while the current damp policy policy
 
05:09:00.150 --> 05:09:00.160 align:start position:0%
is supposed to stand for five years
 
05:09:02.230 --> 05:09:02.240 align:start position:0%
there are already a number of warrant
 
05:09:04.150 --> 05:09:04.160 align:start position:0%
articles proposed by one commissioner
 
05:09:06.550 --> 05:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
mike smith one of which would put him
 
05:09:09.750 --> 05:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
solely in charge of the dam
 
05:09:11.190 --> 05:09:11.200 align:start position:0%
this commissioner has been on
 
05:09:13.670 --> 05:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner on and off for 16 years
 
05:09:15.350 --> 05:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
now as previously mentioned there's been
 
05:09:18.070 --> 05:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
an established pair of successful loons
 
05:09:19.830 --> 05:09:19.840 align:start position:0%
very close to his property on a marshy
 
05:09:19.840 --> 05:09:20.788 align:start position:0%
very close to his property on a marshy
spot

05:09:20.788 --> 05:09:20.798 align:start position:0%
spot
 
05:09:22.628 --> 05:09:22.638 align:start position:0%
a few times the nest was flooded by
 
05:09:24.948 --> 05:09:24.958 align:start position:0%
heavy rains and the eggs were lost
 
05:09:27.350 --> 05:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
to protect that loon nest he put in
 
05:09:29.510 --> 05:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
place the dam management policy i
 
05:09:32.550 --> 05:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
believe is like 2012 2013 around there
 
05:09:32.560 --> 05:09:34.310 align:start position:0%
believe is like 2012 2013 around there
sometime

05:09:34.310 --> 05:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
sometime
 
05:09:37.110 --> 05:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
to conduct an early spring drawdown to a
 
05:09:38.868 --> 05:09:38.878 align:start position:0%
co which was accomplished by removing
 
05:09:41.270 --> 05:09:41.280 align:start position:0%
the two 10 inch boards from the dam
 
05:09:42.628 --> 05:09:42.638 align:start position:0%
according to the loon preservation
 
05:09:43.990 --> 05:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
committee the porridge ponds are the
 
05:09:45.670 --> 05:09:45.680 align:start position:0%
only bodies of water in the entire state
 
05:09:47.430 --> 05:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire who preemptively lower
 
05:09:49.270 --> 05:09:49.280 align:start position:0%
water levels ahead of loon nesting
 
05:09:51.270 --> 05:09:51.280 align:start position:0%
season and this is an addition
 
05:09:53.830 --> 05:09:53.840 align:start position:0%
to the fall
 
05:09:55.830 --> 05:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
now for this isn't for me this this
 
05:09:58.788 --> 05:09:58.798 align:start position:0%
isn't about recreation this is about
 
05:09:58.798 --> 05:09:59.670 align:start position:0%
isn't about recreation this is about
uh

05:09:59.670 --> 05:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:09:59.680 --> 05:10:01.110 align:start position:0%
uh
preserving

05:10:01.110 --> 05:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
preserving
 
05:10:01.120 --> 05:10:01.830 align:start position:0%
preserving
the

05:10:01.830 --> 05:10:01.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:10:04.310 --> 05:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
preserving the pond quality
 
05:10:08.550 --> 05:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
so that we can have a healthy pond
 
05:10:12.150 --> 05:10:12.160 align:start position:0%
i had another point i just lost it
 
05:10:14.070 --> 05:10:14.080 align:start position:0%
and as far as like our members
 
05:10:16.390 --> 05:10:16.400 align:start position:0%
membership right now our membership is
 
05:10:19.510 --> 05:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
low but we do have a broad support from
 
05:10:20.830 --> 05:10:20.840 align:start position:0%
at least 12
 
05:10:23.910 --> 05:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
families on big p and they've written to
 
05:10:25.750 --> 05:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
you in support
 
05:10:27.350 --> 05:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
i do want to point out one thing and
 
05:10:29.910 --> 05:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
that was mr mcconkey raised this article
 
05:10:32.708 --> 05:10:32.718 align:start position:0%
that was written in the conway daily sun
 
05:10:37.110 --> 05:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:44.070 --> 05:10:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:46.070 --> 05:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
that article if it was read was poorly
 
05:10:48.070 --> 05:10:48.080 align:start position:0%
written there was not one fact about big
 
05:10:49.830 --> 05:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
p in it other than that this meeting was
 
05:10:53.030 --> 05:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:55.430 --> 05:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
mr anglers angers who wrote the article
 
05:10:57.270 --> 05:10:57.280 align:start position:0%
encouraged people to write in to oppose
 
05:10:59.670 --> 05:10:59.680 align:start position:0%
a dam i wrote to the owner of the conway
 
05:11:01.350 --> 05:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
daily sun about the lack of research
 
05:11:03.270 --> 05:11:03.280 align:start position:0%
that went into his article
 
05:11:06.628 --> 05:11:06.638 align:start position:0%
here is mark gearing's email response to
 
05:11:06.638 --> 05:11:08.070 align:start position:0%
here is mark gearing's email response to
me

05:11:08.070 --> 05:11:08.080 align:start position:0%
me
 
05:11:10.310 --> 05:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
columns like phishing and hiking are
 
05:11:12.788 --> 05:11:12.798 align:start position:0%
written by experts on their subjects we
 
05:11:15.190 --> 05:11:15.200 align:start position:0%
have never had a need to fact check
 
05:11:16.868 --> 05:11:16.878 align:start position:0%
in fact this is the first time i can
 
05:11:18.868 --> 05:11:18.878 align:start position:0%
remember in 30 years
 
05:11:21.430 --> 05:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
a contributor is off base
 
05:11:23.910 --> 05:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
in fact he's already sent me a letter of
 
05:11:23.920 --> 05:11:25.270 align:start position:0%
in fact he's already sent me a letter of
apology

05:11:25.270 --> 05:11:25.280 align:start position:0%
apology
 
05:11:26.948 --> 05:11:26.958 align:start position:0%
so the owners of the conway daily sun
 
05:11:28.948 --> 05:11:28.958 align:start position:0%
acknowledged that this columnist was off
 
05:11:31.270 --> 05:11:31.280 align:start position:0%
base but the damage had been done that
 
05:11:34.150 --> 05:11:34.160 align:start position:0%
article spurred other people to write to
 
05:11:36.550 --> 05:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
the vdoe commissioners in opposition to
 
05:11:38.550 --> 05:11:38.560 align:start position:0%
the dam
 
05:11:40.150 --> 05:11:40.160 align:start position:0%
now i don't i don't really want to be
 
05:11:42.628 --> 05:11:42.638 align:start position:0%
here today i'm sure
 
05:11:45.430 --> 05:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
but after nine years of naively hoping
 
05:11:48.070 --> 05:11:48.080 align:start position:0%
the next board would be more responsible
 
05:11:49.270 --> 05:11:49.280 align:start position:0%
with the
 
05:11:50.868 --> 05:11:50.878 align:start position:0%
dam at little p
 
05:11:53.350 --> 05:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
and after nine years of watching big p
 
05:11:55.590 --> 05:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
wildlife and waters degrade
 
05:11:58.390 --> 05:11:58.400 align:start position:0%
i couldn't stand by and do nothing it's
 
05:11:59.750 --> 05:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
not my nature
 
05:12:01.430 --> 05:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
no one came forth with the solution we
 
05:12:03.590 --> 05:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
could see no other solution than a very
 
05:12:07.510 --> 05:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
small non-menacing dam to isolate big p
 
05:12:09.270 --> 05:12:09.280 align:start position:0%
from the vagaries of the board of
 
05:12:11.110 --> 05:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
commissioners and to protect its waters
 
05:12:12.788 --> 05:12:12.798 align:start position:0%
and wildlife
 
05:12:15.030 --> 05:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
the dam bureau had recommended a dam
 
05:12:17.110 --> 05:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
fish and game was open to the idea the
 
05:12:18.628 --> 05:12:18.638 align:start position:0%
loon preservation committee has
 
05:12:20.310 --> 05:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
expressed support
 
05:12:22.150 --> 05:12:22.160 align:start position:0%
to protect the waters and the wildlife
 
05:12:23.670 --> 05:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
of big p
 
05:12:25.830 --> 05:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
we gain nothing but a healthy pond
 
05:12:28.230 --> 05:12:28.240 align:start position:0%
so actually we gained quite a bit thank
 
05:12:31.270 --> 05:12:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:35.190 --> 05:12:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:37.830 --> 05:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
representative smith and well
 
05:12:39.430 --> 05:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
representative smith and representative
 
05:12:39.440 --> 05:12:40.390 align:start position:0%
representative smith and representative
gould

05:12:40.390 --> 05:12:40.400 align:start position:0%
gould
 
05:12:43.190 --> 05:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um you mentioned that
 
05:12:46.070 --> 05:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
you have 12 families on big p in support
 
05:12:49.670 --> 05:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
of this yes how many um homes families
 
05:12:51.430 --> 05:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
are there on big p
 
05:12:53.510 --> 05:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
oh gosh um shawna might know the answer
 
05:13:00.788 --> 05:13:00.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:00.798 --> 05:13:01.830 align:start position:0%
 
70.

05:13:01.830 --> 05:13:01.840 align:start position:0%
70.
 
05:13:07.830 --> 05:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:10.948 --> 05:13:10.958 align:start position:0%
representative gould okay thank you mr
 
05:13:13.910 --> 05:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you uh for coming to
 
05:13:16.310 --> 05:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
testify and i don't know if
 
05:13:18.230 --> 05:13:18.240 align:start position:0%
this is the proper question for you or
 
05:13:19.910 --> 05:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
maybe someone else who has already
 
05:13:22.070 --> 05:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
testified i'm not sure but i'm just
 
05:13:24.310 --> 05:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
wondering what the situation of these
 
05:13:26.070 --> 05:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
pawns would be
 
05:13:28.150 --> 05:13:28.160 align:start position:0%
if there were no dams and left in the
 
05:13:30.230 --> 05:13:30.240 align:start position:0%
natural state as they were say 200 years
 
05:13:32.230 --> 05:13:32.240 align:start position:0%
ago oh my god that's what i'm wondering
 
05:13:33.830 --> 05:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
what would be happening in that
 
05:13:36.230 --> 05:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
situation so i wasn't here 200 years ago
 
05:13:38.390 --> 05:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
but i can make an attempt at that
 
05:13:40.470 --> 05:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
um as was mentioned there was a company
 
05:13:42.788 --> 05:13:42.798 align:start position:0%
great northern development company back
 
05:13:45.190 --> 05:13:45.200 align:start position:0%
in the late 60s that found this piece
 
05:13:46.948 --> 05:13:46.958 align:start position:0%
gorgeous piece of land decided to make
 
05:13:48.230 --> 05:13:48.240 align:start position:0%
it um
 
05:13:51.030 --> 05:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
a vacation rental place for
 
05:13:54.150 --> 05:13:54.160 align:start position:0%
uh affluent people from massachusetts or
 
05:13:55.830 --> 05:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
rhode island or wherever they may have
 
05:13:55.840 --> 05:13:56.788 align:start position:0%
rhode island or wherever they may have
been

05:13:56.788 --> 05:13:56.798 align:start position:0%
been
 
05:13:58.070 --> 05:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
but there was probably wasn't enough
 
05:14:00.310 --> 05:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
waterfront so they decided
 
05:14:02.470 --> 05:14:02.480 align:start position:0%
big peanut always been always been there
 
05:14:04.150 --> 05:14:04.160 align:start position:0%
and then there was a creek banford creek
 
05:14:05.750 --> 05:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
that had like flowed down
 
05:14:08.310 --> 05:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
like a creek would and to uh my
 
05:14:10.390 --> 05:14:10.400 align:start position:0%
understanding is they they put a dam
 
05:14:12.070 --> 05:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
into um
 
05:14:14.708 --> 05:14:14.718 align:start position:0%
they put a dam up to create little p and
 
05:14:15.910 --> 05:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
middle pay
 
05:14:17.910 --> 05:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
so if 200 years ago if you were to take
 
05:14:19.910 --> 05:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
the dam out those small ponds those
 
05:14:21.590 --> 05:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
smaller pawns would go away but big p
 
05:14:31.190 --> 05:14:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:33.110 --> 05:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
representative creighton yeah thank you
 
05:14:35.750 --> 05:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
sir thank you for your testimony ma'am
 
05:14:35.760 --> 05:14:38.470 align:start position:0%
sir thank you for your testimony ma'am
um

05:14:38.470 --> 05:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:40.310 --> 05:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
under your understanding and you talked
 
05:14:41.830 --> 05:14:41.840 align:start position:0%
about the control
 
05:14:43.990 --> 05:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
in the committee that controls the lower
 
05:14:45.910 --> 05:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
p dam
 
05:14:45.920 --> 05:14:47.430 align:start position:0%
p dam
so

05:14:47.430 --> 05:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:14:49.430 --> 05:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
if this dam went in who would control it
 
05:14:50.868 --> 05:14:50.878 align:start position:0%
do you know what's the plan for
 
05:14:52.150 --> 05:14:52.160 align:start position:0%
controlling it
 
05:14:54.628 --> 05:14:54.638 align:start position:0%
and how is the control of that any
 
05:14:56.470 --> 05:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
better managed
 
05:14:58.070 --> 05:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
than the lower one i mean is it going to
 
05:14:59.270 --> 05:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
be the same committee different
 
05:15:01.670 --> 05:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
committee what's their expertise why are
 
05:15:04.390 --> 05:15:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:06.708 --> 05:15:06.718 align:start position:0%
expert to to do that
 
05:15:08.628 --> 05:15:08.638 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question um so it
 
05:15:10.708 --> 05:15:10.718 align:start position:0%
would be the same board of commissioners
 
05:15:12.470 --> 05:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
they would have different dm operating
 
05:15:14.948 --> 05:15:14.958 align:start position:0%
policies and manuals the motivations too
 
05:15:16.628 --> 05:15:16.638 align:start position:0%
are different right so the motivation
 
05:15:19.110 --> 05:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
the small at the small p at the small p
 
05:15:19.120 --> 05:15:19.990 align:start position:0%
the small at the small p at the small p
dam

05:15:19.990 --> 05:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
dam
 
05:15:22.310 --> 05:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
is to expose this one marshy spot and in
 
05:15:23.750 --> 05:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
order to do that
 
05:15:25.350 --> 05:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
they have to um
 
05:15:27.590 --> 05:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
take a lot of boards out of the dam to
 
05:15:30.868 --> 05:15:30.878 align:start position:0%
lower the water level low enough for for
 
05:15:31.910 --> 05:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
big p
 
05:15:35.350 --> 05:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
our goal here is to maintain a stable
 
05:15:38.310 --> 05:15:38.320 align:start position:0%
water level the level it would be at
 
05:15:40.230 --> 05:15:40.240 align:start position:0%
or slightly less than this if there was
 
05:15:42.390 --> 05:15:42.400 align:start position:0%
no dam at big p
 
05:15:44.390 --> 05:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
so so the motivations are different at
 
05:15:45.750 --> 05:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
big p we would want to be able to
 
05:15:47.670 --> 05:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
maintain a more stable level so that we
 
05:15:49.830 --> 05:15:49.840 align:start position:0%
can have loans while at lower p they
 
05:15:51.190 --> 05:15:51.200 align:start position:0%
would probably they would they would
 
05:15:52.788 --> 05:15:52.798 align:start position:0%
continue to um
 
05:15:54.390 --> 05:15:54.400 align:start position:0%
draw that down
 
05:15:56.230 --> 05:15:56.240 align:start position:0%
okay but it's just this is this will be
 
05:15:58.708 --> 05:15:58.718 align:start position:0%
our commission yeah it's the same
 
05:16:01.030 --> 05:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
commissioners yes but again different dm
 
05:16:02.708 --> 05:16:02.718 align:start position:0%
operating policies
 
05:16:04.868 --> 05:16:04.878 align:start position:0%
um different um
 
05:16:07.110 --> 05:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
different motivation
 
05:16:09.030 --> 05:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
okay and for a follow answer
 
05:16:11.030 --> 05:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
we're a follow-on so
 
05:16:11.040 --> 05:16:12.470 align:start position:0%
we're a follow-on so
uh

05:16:13.990 --> 05:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to track
 
05:16:16.948 --> 05:16:16.958 align:start position:0%
um numbers so there's 12 of 70 people
 
05:16:16.958 --> 05:16:18.390 align:start position:0%
um numbers so there's 12 of 70 people
opposed

05:16:18.390 --> 05:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
opposed
 
05:16:20.310 --> 05:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
well there's 12 right now 12 right now
 
05:16:22.708 --> 05:16:22.718 align:start position:0%
so okay and we had bear with me one
 
05:16:26.150 --> 05:16:26.160 align:start position:0%
second so we've had testimony
 
05:16:26.160 --> 05:16:27.030 align:start position:0%
second so we've had testimony
that

05:16:27.030 --> 05:16:27.040 align:start position:0%

05:16:29.830 --> 05:16:29.840 align:start position:0%
the people around the lake that had
 
05:16:31.110 --> 05:16:31.120 align:start position:0%

notified everyone else not notified or
 
05:16:43.190 --> 05:16:43.200 align:start position:0%
what's been the outreach yeah to the

mean we've got clearly people in this
 
05:16:52.868 --> 05:16:52.878 align:start position:0%
room that feel like they had no
 
05:16:55.350 --> 05:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
notification and we have other people
 
05:16:56.310 --> 05:16:56.320 align:start position:0%
who are
 
05:16:58.230 --> 05:16:58.240 align:start position:0%
obviously well informed and been
 
05:16:59.430 --> 05:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
involved with this
 
05:17:00.788 --> 05:17:00.798 align:start position:0%
from the beginning so i'm just trying to
 
05:17:02.310 --> 05:17:02.320 align:start position:0%
understand how you
 
05:17:04.628 --> 05:17:04.638 align:start position:0%
go from being uninformed to being an
 
05:17:04.638 --> 05:17:05.910 align:start position:0%
go from being uninformed to being an
expert

05:17:05.910 --> 05:17:05.920 align:start position:0%
expert
 
05:17:07.830 --> 05:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
and what that process was thank you
 
05:17:10.150 --> 05:17:10.160 align:start position:0%
thank you so this this is actually uh
 
05:17:12.390 --> 05:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
something that we had you know been

dan bureau about for i don't know five
 
05:17:19.270 --> 05:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
years charlie krautman before we talked
 
05:17:21.830 --> 05:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
with mr doyan and um carol henderson at
 
05:17:23.430 --> 05:17:23.440 align:start position:0%
fish and game so they're aware of this
 
05:17:23.440 --> 05:17:24.788 align:start position:0%
fish and game so they're aware of this
situation

05:17:24.788 --> 05:17:24.798 align:start position:0%
situation
 
05:17:26.708 --> 05:17:26.718 align:start position:0%
now as far as
 
05:17:26.718 --> 05:17:28.150 align:start position:0%
now as far as
we

05:17:28.150 --> 05:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
we
 
05:17:28.160 --> 05:17:29.910 align:start position:0%
we
received

05:17:29.910 --> 05:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
received
 
05:17:29.920 --> 05:17:30.868 align:start position:0%
received
uh

05:17:30.868 --> 05:17:30.878 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:17:32.470 --> 05:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
unanimous support from the village
 
05:17:34.708 --> 05:17:34.718 align:start position:0%
district of idaho commissioners in
 
05:17:38.470 --> 05:17:38.480 align:start position:0%
august to explore the possibility of a
 
05:17:42.070 --> 05:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
legislative bill for a dam for little p
 
05:17:44.390 --> 05:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
i mean for big p excuse me
 
05:17:46.628 --> 05:17:46.638 align:start position:0%
so everything so that was just in late
 
05:17:48.150 --> 05:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
you know mid august
 
05:17:50.948 --> 05:17:50.958 align:start position:0%
everything happened pretty quickly
 
05:17:52.948 --> 05:17:52.958 align:start position:0%
this is not our area of expertise so we
 
05:17:54.708 --> 05:17:54.718 align:start position:0%
consulted a lawyer because this is not
 
05:17:57.110 --> 05:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
my area of expertise so it's jason
 
05:17:59.590 --> 05:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
reamers of bcm environmental and land
 
05:18:01.430 --> 05:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
law right here in concord
 
05:18:03.350 --> 05:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
the first test was to find a sponsor
 
05:18:04.948 --> 05:18:04.958 align:start position:0%
jason reached out to mark mcconkey and
 
05:18:07.350 --> 05:18:07.360 align:start position:0%
mark agreed after review agreed to
 
05:18:09.030 --> 05:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
sponsor a bill and suggested we enlist
 
05:18:10.788 --> 05:18:10.798 align:start position:0%
other representatives some of this takes
 
05:18:15.590 --> 05:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:18.310 --> 05:18:18.320 align:start position:0%
now too the the issue of fluctuating
 
05:18:20.788 --> 05:18:20.798 align:start position:0%
water levels and of the prospect of
 
05:18:23.190 --> 05:18:23.200 align:start position:0%
raising a dam had been raised many times
 
05:18:26.390 --> 05:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
at various uh vdoe commissioners meeting
 
05:18:28.628 --> 05:18:28.638 align:start position:0%
and again at the dam management policy
 
05:18:28.638 --> 05:18:29.910 align:start position:0%
and again at the dam management policy
meeting

05:18:29.910 --> 05:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
05:18:31.190 --> 05:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
in august
 
05:18:33.270 --> 05:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
and those are open to the public anyone
 
05:18:35.670 --> 05:18:35.680 align:start position:0%
can go to those
 
05:18:37.110 --> 05:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
now at the beginning of november
 
05:18:38.628 --> 05:18:38.638 align:start position:0%
november we knew we needed to have a
 
05:18:40.470 --> 05:18:40.480 align:start position:0%
meeting with all affected residents
 
05:18:42.150 --> 05:18:42.160 align:start position:0%
unfortunate circumstances caused my
 
05:18:43.990 --> 05:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
husband to be away from his home and
 
05:18:44.000 --> 05:18:44.948 align:start position:0%
husband to be away from his home and
family

05:18:44.948 --> 05:18:44.958 align:start position:0%
family
 
05:18:47.110 --> 05:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
for four to five weeks
 
05:18:50.470 --> 05:18:50.480 align:start position:0%
returning right before christmas
 
05:18:52.550 --> 05:18:52.560 align:start position:0%
so that sort of uh waylaid us a little
 
05:18:54.470 --> 05:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
bit the hearing that was scheduled this
 
05:18:55.990 --> 05:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
hearing right here was scheduled sooner
 
05:18:57.990 --> 05:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
than we expected and as soon as mr
 
05:19:00.868 --> 05:19:00.878 align:start position:0%
mcconkie notified us on monday january
 
05:19:02.948 --> 05:19:02.958 align:start position:0%
10th we set up a meeting as quickly as
 
05:19:04.708 --> 05:19:04.718 align:start position:0%
we could and notified as many residents
 
05:19:06.948 --> 05:19:06.958 align:start position:0%
as we had email addresses for
 
05:19:08.550 --> 05:19:08.560 align:start position:0%
that was uh january and we had the
 
05:19:11.110 --> 05:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
meeting on january 7. yes we wish we had
 
05:19:12.868 --> 05:19:12.878 align:start position:0%
been able to give more notice and reach
 
05:19:14.948 --> 05:19:14.958 align:start position:0%
more people and for that we have
 
05:19:14.958 --> 05:19:23.110 align:start position:0%
more people and for that we have
apologize

05:19:23.110 --> 05:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:25.190 --> 05:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
representative post for question thank
 
05:19:26.628 --> 05:19:26.638 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman and thank you for your
 
05:19:29.830 --> 05:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
testimony today um i have a question if
 
05:19:29.840 --> 05:19:31.110 align:start position:0%
testimony today um i have a question if
the

05:19:31.110 --> 05:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:19:34.310 --> 05:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
if the dam on little p
 
05:19:35.990 --> 05:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
was not
 
05:19:38.150 --> 05:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
putting in and taking out would that
 
05:19:40.230 --> 05:19:40.240 align:start position:0%
preclude you from wanting to put a dam
 
05:19:43.590 --> 05:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
on big p absolutely
 
05:19:46.230 --> 05:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
so why are you in support of the dam
 
05:19:47.430 --> 05:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
and rather
 
05:19:47.440 --> 05:19:49.270 align:start position:0%
and rather
than

05:19:49.270 --> 05:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
than
 
05:19:51.590 --> 05:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
removing the other dam or oh you can't
 
05:19:53.350 --> 05:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
remove the other dam because then you do
 
05:19:56.310 --> 05:19:56.320 align:start position:0%
away with little p and middle p
 
05:19:58.070 --> 05:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
so that that dam has been there for a
 
05:19:59.750 --> 05:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
while that dam's been there since the
 
05:20:01.910 --> 05:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
late 1960s and the
 
05:20:03.670 --> 05:20:03.680 align:start position:0%
little p and middle p are only there
 
05:20:05.350 --> 05:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
because of that dam
 
05:20:07.750 --> 05:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
right okay so that's why that dam can't
 
05:20:09.510 --> 05:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
be removed that dam is owned by the
 
05:20:11.030 --> 05:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
village district of idaho ice it is
 
05:20:14.948 --> 05:20:14.958 align:start position:0%
controlled by the three commissioners
 
05:20:16.230 --> 05:20:16.240 align:start position:0%
a follow-up
 
05:20:18.868 --> 05:20:18.878 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up
 
05:20:18.878 --> 05:20:19.590 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up
so

05:20:19.590 --> 05:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:20:21.270 --> 05:20:21.280 align:start position:0%
so with
 
05:20:24.310 --> 05:20:24.320 align:start position:0%
with the dam that's going to go in place
 
05:20:27.350 --> 05:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
if it gets through
 
05:20:29.350 --> 05:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
you would still go to the same people
 
05:20:31.750 --> 05:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
even though knowing
 
05:20:31.760 --> 05:20:33.910 align:start position:0%
even though knowing
that

05:20:33.910 --> 05:20:33.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:20:36.310 --> 05:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
the problems they've caused you wouldn't
 
05:20:38.390 --> 05:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
do something separate you wouldn't be
 
05:20:41.110 --> 05:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
looking for a separate
 
05:20:43.510 --> 05:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
group and would you not
 
05:20:45.510 --> 05:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
be looking for more support
 
05:20:45.520 --> 05:20:46.390 align:start position:0%
be looking for more support
from

05:20:46.390 --> 05:20:46.400 align:start position:0%
from
 
05:20:49.030 --> 05:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
the homeowners um great question thank
 
05:20:52.548 --> 05:20:52.558 align:start position:0%
you we're open to any and all
 
05:20:54.150 --> 05:20:54.160 align:start position:0%
we're looking for the best possible
 
05:20:56.150 --> 05:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
solution to this problem now whether
 
05:20:58.150 --> 05:20:58.160 align:start position:0%
that's the vdoe owning the dam and
 
05:21:00.548 --> 05:21:00.558 align:start position:0%
controlling the dam
 
05:21:02.948 --> 05:21:02.958 align:start position:0%
you know maybe maybe it's the vdoe
 
05:21:04.868 --> 05:21:04.878 align:start position:0%
owning the dam but not but not having
 
05:21:06.150 --> 05:21:06.160 align:start position:0%
the control of the dam and maybe a
 
05:21:08.310 --> 05:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
committee is formed that will have input
 
05:21:09.350 --> 05:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
into that and
 
05:21:11.190 --> 05:21:11.200 align:start position:0%
if that committee was formed we would
 
05:21:13.190 --> 05:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
seek a really broad audience we we have
 
05:21:15.110 --> 05:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
a wetlands specialist on big p who would
 
05:21:18.310 --> 05:21:18.320 align:start position:0%
be a part of that we have lindsey and
 
05:21:20.470 --> 05:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
david wedge again
 
05:21:22.548 --> 05:21:22.558 align:start position:0%
with the new england aquarium
 
05:21:24.390 --> 05:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
who who one is an expert in the fishes
 
05:21:24.400 --> 05:21:25.990 align:start position:0%
who who one is an expert in the fishes
department

05:21:25.990 --> 05:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
department
 
05:21:28.070 --> 05:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
you're kind of going
 
05:21:28.080 --> 05:21:29.270 align:start position:0%
you're kind of going
off

05:21:29.270 --> 05:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
off
 
05:21:29.280 --> 05:21:30.628 align:start position:0%
off
basically

05:21:30.628 --> 05:21:30.638 align:start position:0%
basically
 
05:21:33.430 --> 05:21:33.440 align:start position:0%
what you're saying is simply if the dam
 
05:21:36.230 --> 05:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
goes up on big p
 
05:21:38.868 --> 05:21:38.878 align:start position:0%
the dam on little p
 
05:21:40.708 --> 05:21:40.718 align:start position:0%
is really irrelevant
 
05:21:45.030 --> 05:21:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:47.110 --> 05:21:47.120 align:start position:0%

is it on okay thank you thank you for

the opportunity to speak

uh as an ecologically minded shoreline
 
05:22:28.230 --> 05:22:28.240 align:start position:0%
homeowner i have worked with the new
 
05:22:30.390 --> 05:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire lakes association to make the
 
05:22:32.230 --> 05:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
necessary changes
 
05:22:34.390 --> 05:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
to my property in order to attain lake
 
05:22:35.910 --> 05:22:35.920 align:start position:0%
smart status
 
05:22:37.190 --> 05:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
this would not have been possible
 
05:22:39.030 --> 05:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
without the help of my generous friends
 
05:22:41.270 --> 05:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
some of whom are here today with various
 
05:22:43.590 --> 05:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
perspectives on the bill before us
 
05:22:45.270 --> 05:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
i feel confident that all of my
 
05:22:46.868 --> 05:22:46.878 align:start position:0%
neighbors are concerned with the health
 
05:22:49.750 --> 05:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
of the pond and want to take the steps
 
05:22:51.990 --> 05:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
necessary to restore and conserve its
 
05:22:52.000 --> 05:22:53.270 align:start position:0%
necessary to restore and conserve its
ecosystem

05:22:53.270 --> 05:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
ecosystem
 
05:22:54.868 --> 05:22:54.878 align:start position:0%
even though we may have differing
 
05:22:58.628 --> 05:22:58.638 align:start position:0%
viewpoints on how to achieve that goal
 
05:23:00.708 --> 05:23:00.718 align:start position:0%
nevertheless i am optimistic that we can
 
05:23:02.390 --> 05:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
come together when we make decisions
 
05:23:04.628 --> 05:23:04.638 align:start position:0%
informed by science to determine the
 
05:23:06.310 --> 05:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
best path forward
 
05:23:08.470 --> 05:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
only last thursday did i learn of the
 
05:23:11.510 --> 05:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
proposed house bill 1532 through an
 
05:23:13.590 --> 05:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
email invitation to a zoom meeting on
 
05:23:15.350 --> 05:23:15.360 align:start position:0%
the following monday
 
05:23:17.510 --> 05:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
hosted by two of the five members of the
 
05:23:20.868 --> 05:23:20.878 align:start position:0%
big p porridge pond association
 
05:23:23.350 --> 05:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
this small group of part-time residents
 
05:23:26.150 --> 05:23:26.160 align:start position:0%
is a different organization than the big
 
05:23:29.430 --> 05:23:29.440 align:start position:0%
p porge pond preservation association of
 
05:23:33.430 --> 05:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
which i am a member the latter holds 501
 
05:23:36.548 --> 05:23:36.558 align:start position:0%
c 3 status and is managed by a full
 
05:23:36.558 --> 05:23:37.510 align:start position:0%
c 3 status and is managed by a full
board

05:23:37.510 --> 05:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
board
 
05:23:37.520 --> 05:23:38.868 align:start position:0%
board
including

05:23:38.868 --> 05:23:38.878 align:start position:0%
including
 
05:23:41.510 --> 05:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
two wetland scientists
 
05:23:44.070 --> 05:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
which serves a 70 person membership that
 
05:23:46.948 --> 05:23:46.958 align:start position:0%
continues to increase
 
05:23:49.350 --> 05:23:49.360 align:start position:0%
this just as an aside this organization
 
05:23:51.910 --> 05:23:51.920 align:start position:0%
also has developed relationships across
 
05:23:53.510 --> 05:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
the region with
 
05:23:55.910 --> 05:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
the town and
 
05:23:59.590 --> 05:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
other like des and other organizat
 
05:24:01.910 --> 05:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
organizations in order to
 
05:24:01.920 --> 05:24:03.350 align:start position:0%
organizations in order to
um

05:24:03.350 --> 05:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:24:05.910 --> 05:24:05.920 align:start position:0%
work uh on a solution for the runoff
 
05:24:08.948 --> 05:24:08.958 align:start position:0%
coming from rock house mountain
 
05:24:11.510 --> 05:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
so today i am here to propose that if
 
05:24:14.470 --> 05:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
this bill is not killed by opposition it
 
05:24:16.948 --> 05:24:16.958 align:start position:0%
should be amended to authorize the
 
05:24:20.708 --> 05:24:20.718 align:start position:0%
formerly incorporated non-profit big p
 
05:24:23.750 --> 05:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
porridge pond preservation association
 
05:24:26.310 --> 05:24:26.320 align:start position:0%
which represents a majority of the
 
05:24:29.590 --> 05:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
shoreline and water watershed residents
 
05:24:31.670 --> 05:24:31.680 align:start position:0%
as the entity that may construct and
 
05:24:34.150 --> 05:24:34.160 align:start position:0%
manage a dam on the pond
 
05:24:36.948 --> 05:24:36.958 align:start position:0%
in i i also want to add that um the
 
05:24:39.430 --> 05:24:39.440 align:start position:0%
village district of idaho ice
 
05:24:39.440 --> 05:24:40.788 align:start position:0%
village district of idaho ice
um

05:24:40.788 --> 05:24:40.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:24:43.750 --> 05:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
the the land within the village district
 
05:24:46.948 --> 05:24:46.958 align:start position:0%
is a minority of the shoreline on big p
 
05:24:46.958 --> 05:24:48.390 align:start position:0%
is a minority of the shoreline on big p
port

05:24:48.390 --> 05:24:48.400 align:start position:0%
port
 
05:24:50.470 --> 05:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
um so in the several days since i
 
05:24:52.470 --> 05:24:52.480 align:start position:0%
learned of the bill i have not had
 
05:24:54.788 --> 05:24:54.798 align:start position:0%
adequate time to do enough research to
 
05:24:56.948 --> 05:24:56.958 align:start position:0%
to determine whether a dam would aid or
 
05:24:58.708 --> 05:24:58.718 align:start position:0%
harm big p
 
05:25:00.868 --> 05:25:00.878 align:start position:0%
i understand the water quality issues
 
05:25:03.510 --> 05:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
faced by the pond are complex due to a
 
05:25:05.670 --> 05:25:05.680 align:start position:0%
variety of environmental pressures and
 
05:25:05.680 --> 05:25:07.110 align:start position:0%
variety of environmental pressures and
pollutants

05:25:07.110 --> 05:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
pollutants
 
05:25:08.868 --> 05:25:08.878 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the topic of water
 
05:25:12.070 --> 05:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
fluctuation a study was conducted by
 
05:25:14.788 --> 05:25:14.798 align:start position:0%
wetland scientists that determined it is
 
05:25:16.868 --> 05:25:16.878 align:start position:0%
physically impossible for the little p
 
05:25:19.830 --> 05:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
porridge pond dam to cause a drop of
 
05:25:22.548 --> 05:25:22.558 align:start position:0%
more than six inches in big p
 
05:25:24.788 --> 05:25:24.798 align:start position:0%
and even then in only limited
 
05:25:24.798 --> 05:25:26.708 align:start position:0%
and even then in only limited
circumstances

05:25:26.708 --> 05:25:26.718 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
05:25:29.510 --> 05:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
therefore i fear that adding a dam to
 
05:25:32.150 --> 05:25:32.160 align:start position:0%
solve the problem of mismanagement of
 
05:25:34.708 --> 05:25:34.718 align:start position:0%
another dam downstream may be a
 
05:25:36.708 --> 05:25:36.718 align:start position:0%
short-sighted solution
 
05:25:38.708 --> 05:25:38.718 align:start position:0%
during a time in history when we can be
 
05:25:41.350 --> 05:25:41.360 align:start position:0%
far more innovative in our approaches to
 
05:25:44.310 --> 05:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
wetland restoration and conservation
 
05:25:46.548 --> 05:25:46.558 align:start position:0%
in the past couple of days i have come
 
05:25:49.670 --> 05:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
to understand that as a great pond big p
 
05:25:51.670 --> 05:25:51.680 align:start position:0%
is held in public trust and that the new
 
05:25:54.470 --> 05:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire legislature enacted statutes
 
05:25:55.830 --> 05:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
for the state's department of
 
05:25:58.070 --> 05:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
environmental services to regulate
 
05:25:59.910 --> 05:25:59.920 align:start position:0%
activities that take place within that
 
05:25:59.920 --> 05:26:01.750 align:start position:0%
activities that take place within that
trust

05:26:01.750 --> 05:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
trust
 
05:26:05.350 --> 05:26:05.360 align:start position:0%
the the 1532 bill proposal needs to be
 
05:26:07.350 --> 05:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
carefully examined by specialized
 
05:26:10.070 --> 05:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
bureaus in the des because a dam that
 
05:26:12.628 --> 05:26:12.638 align:start position:0%
controls water levels at big p will have
 
05:26:15.270 --> 05:26:15.280 align:start position:0%
impacts on grandfathered septic systems
 
05:26:17.110 --> 05:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
along the waterfront
 
05:26:19.350 --> 05:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
overall water quality
 
05:26:22.548 --> 05:26:22.558 align:start position:0%
and the fish amphibians loons and eagles
 
05:26:25.510 --> 05:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
and other animals including humans
 
05:26:27.990 --> 05:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
that depend on a healthy ecosystem
 
05:26:30.868 --> 05:26:30.878 align:start position:0%
currently there has been no professional
 
05:26:33.350 --> 05:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
ecological impact evaluation completed
 
05:26:35.030 --> 05:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
to assess
 
05:26:37.270 --> 05:26:37.280 align:start position:0%
these concerns and i believe doing so is
 
05:26:39.110 --> 05:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
necessary to proceed
 
05:26:41.510 --> 05:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
it if it turns out that a dam is an
 
05:26:43.350 --> 05:26:43.360 align:start position:0%
appropriate solution
 
05:26:45.110 --> 05:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
let's take the time to do it right so
 
05:26:46.868 --> 05:26:46.878 align:start position:0%
that we are not in a position of having
 
05:26:49.670 --> 05:26:49.680 align:start position:0%
to remediate further ecological damage
 
05:26:51.830 --> 05:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
in the future to an already overburdened
 
05:26:55.030 --> 05:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
pond i did want to add another
 
05:26:56.628 --> 05:26:56.638 align:start position:0%
couple of sentences to what i have
 
05:26:58.868 --> 05:26:58.878 align:start position:0%
written here which is that most of the
 
05:27:01.830 --> 05:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
testimony today has
 
05:27:01.840 --> 05:27:03.510 align:start position:0%
testimony today has
included

05:27:03.510 --> 05:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
included
 
05:27:05.910 --> 05:27:05.920 align:start position:0%
frustration over how the village
 
05:27:08.548 --> 05:27:08.558 align:start position:0%
district of idawes manages
 
05:27:11.110 --> 05:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
and operates the little p porridge pond
 
05:27:11.120 --> 05:27:12.070 align:start position:0%
and operates the little p porridge pond
dam

05:27:12.070 --> 05:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
dam
 
05:27:15.350 --> 05:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't make any sense to me that
 
05:27:15.360 --> 05:27:16.548 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't make any sense to me that
um

05:27:16.548 --> 05:27:16.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:27:18.788 --> 05:27:18.798 align:start position:0%
they would be that the village district
 
05:27:20.788 --> 05:27:20.798 align:start position:0%
of idaho ice would be
 
05:27:22.868 --> 05:27:22.878 align:start position:0%
nominated to
 
05:27:24.390 --> 05:27:24.400 align:start position:0%
control and manage
 
05:27:26.948 --> 05:27:26.958 align:start position:0%
this dam if they haven't been able to do
 
05:27:29.830 --> 05:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
an adequate job of the other one
 
05:27:30.948 --> 05:27:30.958 align:start position:0%
that's why
 
05:27:33.030 --> 05:27:33.040 align:start position:0%
again i think that
 
05:27:36.470 --> 05:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
it makes more sense to amend the bill
 
05:27:36.480 --> 05:27:37.430 align:start position:0%
it makes more sense to amend the bill
to

05:27:37.430 --> 05:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:27:39.030 --> 05:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
make sure that
 
05:27:39.040 --> 05:27:40.390 align:start position:0%
make sure that
the

05:27:40.390 --> 05:27:40.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:27:43.590 --> 05:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
construction and management of
 
05:27:45.270 --> 05:27:45.280 align:start position:0%
any proposed dam
 
05:27:47.190 --> 05:27:47.200 align:start position:0%
would uh fall
 
05:27:47.200 --> 05:27:48.310 align:start position:0%
would uh fall
to

05:27:48.310 --> 05:27:48.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:27:50.788 --> 05:27:50.798 align:start position:0%
organizations like like
 
05:27:52.788 --> 05:27:52.798 align:start position:0%
the big p porridge pond preservation
 
05:27:54.390 --> 05:27:54.400 align:start position:0%

05:28:58.628 --> 05:28:58.638 align:start position:0%
uh ten
 
05:29:00.190 --> 05:29:00.200 align:start position:0%
ten minutes not
 
05:29:04.708 --> 05:29:04.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:06.310 --> 05:29:06.320 align:start position:0%
put it this way
 
05:29:09.510 --> 05:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:09.520 --> 05:29:11.590 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

05:29:11.590 --> 05:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:29:14.230 --> 05:29:14.240 align:start position:0%
yeah put your button on but uh all right
 
05:29:16.708 --> 05:29:16.718 align:start position:0%
you can see if you can do it in
 
05:29:18.390 --> 05:29:18.400 align:start position:0%
four minutes i'll try to do it in like
 
05:29:20.470 --> 05:29:20.480 align:start position:0%
two no
 
05:29:21.990 --> 05:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
it would be appreciated we're only
 
05:29:25.670 --> 05:29:25.680 align:start position:0%
running well forget it i'll be real fast
 
05:29:28.070 --> 05:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
i'm 72 years old i've been there 72
 
05:29:29.830 --> 05:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
years i've seen everything one of the
 
05:29:33.430 --> 05:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
original seven camps on the lake
 
05:29:35.990 --> 05:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
i took over the loons for a guy named
 
05:29:37.430 --> 05:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
bill mclean
 
05:29:39.990 --> 05:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
many years ago when i was about 18. he
 
05:29:41.670 --> 05:29:41.680 align:start position:0%
couldn't do it no more i said i take
 
05:29:46.150 --> 05:29:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:49.670 --> 05:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
for 40 years we always had two
 
05:29:51.430 --> 05:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
two baby loons
 
05:29:54.230 --> 05:29:54.240 align:start position:0%
or one or two always
 
05:29:55.990 --> 05:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
we don't have them no more
 
05:29:58.948 --> 05:29:58.958 align:start position:0%
the last loons i think was
 
05:30:00.948 --> 05:30:00.958 align:start position:0%
about eight years ago
 
05:30:05.350 --> 05:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:07.750 --> 05:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
it needs water in it in the spring the
 
05:30:11.270 --> 05:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
reason i i know this uh many years ago
 
05:30:14.230 --> 05:30:14.240 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm probably 30 years old i'm really
 
05:30:16.230 --> 05:30:16.240 align:start position:0%
interested in the porn i go
 
05:30:18.470 --> 05:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
i see the game wardens out there it was
 
05:30:20.788 --> 05:30:20.798 align:start position:0%
the biologist the guy was out there with
 
05:30:24.390 --> 05:30:24.400 align:start position:0%
two sane nets i i paddled out
 
05:30:26.150 --> 05:30:26.160 align:start position:0%
i said what are you what are you doing
 
05:30:28.070 --> 05:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
he goes i'm checking the lake
 
05:30:30.708 --> 05:30:30.718 align:start position:0%
for for the warm water species i said
 
05:30:32.788 --> 05:30:32.798 align:start position:0%
how i said okay
 
05:30:34.788 --> 05:30:34.798 align:start position:0%
he said what how's the lake i said
 
05:30:36.788 --> 05:30:36.798 align:start position:0%
what's the lake look like so this lake
 
05:30:39.990 --> 05:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
is in the top 10 percent of the state he
 
05:30:42.150 --> 05:30:42.160 align:start position:0%
goes see and i said why is it like that
 
05:30:43.990 --> 05:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
he goes see how this
 
05:30:46.310 --> 05:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
all around the edge of this lake
 
05:30:48.708 --> 05:30:48.718 align:start position:0%
it's all right up into the tree into the
 
05:30:48.718 --> 05:30:49.750 align:start position:0%
it's all right up into the tree into the
bushes

05:30:49.750 --> 05:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
bushes
 
05:30:51.910 --> 05:30:51.920 align:start position:0%
in the spring which is right where it
 
05:30:53.110 --> 05:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
needs to be
 
05:30:56.548 --> 05:30:56.558 align:start position:0%
all the fish all the way around go spawn
 
05:30:58.230 --> 05:30:58.240 align:start position:0%
they get protected
 
05:31:01.190 --> 05:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
as the summer goes on it goes down
 
05:31:04.548 --> 05:31:04.558 align:start position:0%
it goes okay that's it so that lake was
 
05:31:07.510 --> 05:31:07.520 align:start position:0%
vibrant smell you could look out on that
 
05:31:09.350 --> 05:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
pond and see
 
05:31:13.430 --> 05:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
50 75 schools of smelt out on that lake
 
05:31:15.750 --> 05:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
we've caught fish in that lake for years
 
05:31:15.760 --> 05:31:16.708 align:start position:0%
we've caught fish in that lake for years
like

05:31:16.708 --> 05:31:16.718 align:start position:0%
like
 
05:31:19.270 --> 05:31:19.280 align:start position:0%
big fish big brown trout
 
05:31:21.830 --> 05:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
so anyways
 
05:31:24.390 --> 05:31:24.400 align:start position:0%
we need the high water in the spring it
 
05:31:27.670 --> 05:31:27.680 align:start position:0%
can go down i mean it go down get people
 
05:31:28.868 --> 05:31:28.878 align:start position:0%
because they want to swim they want to
 
05:31:31.110 --> 05:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
have beaches no problem but we need it
 
05:31:32.788 --> 05:31:32.798 align:start position:0%
in the spring
 
05:31:34.708 --> 05:31:34.718 align:start position:0%
um by the way
 
05:31:37.590 --> 05:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
a comment about who runs the dam
 
05:31:39.990 --> 05:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
it can't be the idol ice people
 
05:31:42.230 --> 05:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
they have a big hole in their dam right
 
05:31:44.470 --> 05:31:44.480 align:start position:0%
now about six feet down
 
05:31:46.868 --> 05:31:46.878 align:start position:0%
they can't be relied on and i agree
 
05:31:49.830 --> 05:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
completely with victoria if this dam is
 
05:31:49.840 --> 05:31:50.708 align:start position:0%
completely with victoria if this dam is
there

05:31:50.708 --> 05:31:50.718 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:31:54.390 --> 05:31:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:56.948 --> 05:31:56.958 align:start position:0%
operation of it when we get a rain we
 
05:31:58.788 --> 05:31:58.798 align:start position:0%
need a couple inches of water get a
 
05:32:01.350 --> 05:32:01.360 align:start position:0%
board in there and keep that water
 
05:32:03.430 --> 05:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
because if it goes down we'd have no
 
05:32:05.430 --> 05:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
control over it
 
05:32:05.440 --> 05:32:09.350 align:start position:0%
control over it
um

05:32:09.350 --> 05:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:12.230 --> 05:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
that's about the best i can say the as
 
05:32:14.548 --> 05:32:14.558 align:start position:0%
far as the fish and game department
 
05:32:17.510 --> 05:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
there there's a boat ramp but
 
05:32:19.350 --> 05:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
i i'm a fisherman i've been a fisherman
 
05:32:21.670 --> 05:32:21.680 align:start position:0%
my whole life anna you know
 
05:32:24.390 --> 05:32:24.400 align:start position:0%
i'm a fisheries guy you can't get a boat
 
05:32:27.670 --> 05:32:27.680 align:start position:0%
in there in in august there's no water
 
05:32:30.150 --> 05:32:30.160 align:start position:0%
and in fact couple years ago when we had
 
05:32:32.310 --> 05:32:32.320 align:start position:0%
the bad one i'd say four to five years
 
05:32:35.750 --> 05:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
ago that water was down at least
 
05:32:37.750 --> 05:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna say a foot and a half my boat
 
05:32:39.910 --> 05:32:39.920 align:start position:0%
was right on the gravel i'd never seen
 
05:32:42.708 --> 05:32:42.718 align:start position:0%
that and by the way i think and i don't
 
05:32:45.270 --> 05:32:45.280 align:start position:0%
know for sure but i think our pond is
 
05:32:47.990 --> 05:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
about a foot and a half it should be a
 
05:32:50.708 --> 05:32:50.718 align:start position:0%
foot and a half higher than than the
 
05:32:50.718 --> 05:32:51.910 align:start position:0%
foot and a half higher than than the
middle

05:32:51.910 --> 05:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
middle
 
05:32:53.910 --> 05:32:53.920 align:start position:0%
middle dam where we are definitely
 
05:32:53.920 --> 05:32:54.868 align:start position:0%
middle dam where we are definitely
higher

05:32:54.868 --> 05:32:54.878 align:start position:0%
higher
 
05:32:57.350 --> 05:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
and it's got to be kept up there and
 
05:32:57.360 --> 05:32:58.150 align:start position:0%
and it's got to be kept up there and
like

05:32:58.150 --> 05:32:58.160 align:start position:0%
like
 
05:33:01.350 --> 05:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
you said or victoria said
 
05:33:01.360 --> 05:33:02.230 align:start position:0%
you said or victoria said
um

05:33:02.230 --> 05:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:33:04.230 --> 05:33:04.240 align:start position:0%
she thinks it's a little lower i i'm
 
05:33:07.350 --> 05:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
pretty sure it's higher
 
05:33:09.990 --> 05:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
we need to keep it up in that level and
 
05:33:11.830 --> 05:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
i don't see any reason why all the
 
05:33:14.310 --> 05:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
people around the pond we can't come to
 
05:33:17.350 --> 05:33:17.360 align:start position:0%
a happy happy conclusion about what's a
 
05:33:17.360 --> 05:33:18.230 align:start position:0%
a happy happy conclusion about what's a
good

05:33:18.230 --> 05:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
good
 
05:33:20.788 --> 05:33:20.798 align:start position:0%
level in the summer but in the spring
 
05:33:23.190 --> 05:33:23.200 align:start position:0%
we've got to get the fish to breed
 
05:33:25.110 --> 05:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
if you don't have those guys you've got
 
05:33:27.750 --> 05:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
a you've got a dead pond we got a dead
 
05:33:30.230 --> 05:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
pond it was about four or five years ago
 
05:33:32.628 --> 05:33:32.638 align:start position:0%
it was dead it was down at least a foot
 
05:33:34.390 --> 05:33:34.400 align:start position:0%
and a half
 
05:33:35.750 --> 05:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
05:33:37.590 --> 05:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much any questions by

it's a pleasure to be here with you
 
05:38:56.470 --> 05:38:56.480 align:start position:0%
today my name is ted dears

my name is ted diers and i am the
 
05:39:00.150 --> 05:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
administrator of the watershed
 
05:39:01.990 --> 05:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
management bureau at the new hampshire
 
05:39:04.628 --> 05:39:04.638 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services and
 
05:39:06.948 --> 05:39:06.958 align:start position:0%
so um
 
05:39:09.270 --> 05:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
this bill in front of us 1167 this is
 
05:39:13.350 --> 05:39:13.360 align:start position:0%
1167. we're talking yes yes okay 1167 uh
 
05:39:16.548 --> 05:39:16.558 align:start position:0%
would add some pfast chemicals as
 
05:39:19.990 --> 05:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
surface water to uh as mcl's maximum
 
05:39:22.310 --> 05:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
contaminant levels for drinking water to
 
05:39:25.110 --> 05:39:25.120 align:start position:0%
our surface water regulations
 
05:39:27.990 --> 05:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
uh you heard testimony
 
05:39:30.070 --> 05:39:30.080 align:start position:0%
last week i believe on a bill called
 
05:39:32.948 --> 05:39:32.958 align:start position:0%
1618 house bill 1618
 
05:39:35.750 --> 05:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
which would do which would set the mcls
 
05:39:38.628 --> 05:39:38.638 align:start position:0%
that are discussed in this bill
 
05:39:41.910 --> 05:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
into the drinking water regulations
 
05:39:43.830 --> 05:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
and i know that you got testimony on
 
05:39:46.150 --> 05:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
that and you got testimony on the pfas
 
05:39:48.628 --> 05:39:48.638 align:start position:0%
aspects of that and the toxicity and the
 
05:39:50.948 --> 05:39:50.958 align:start position:0%
concentrations and all of that stuff so
 
05:39:53.350 --> 05:39:53.360 align:start position:0%
i know you heard all of that last week
 
05:39:55.830 --> 05:39:55.840 align:start position:0%
so i'm not going to go back into that
 
05:39:58.868 --> 05:39:58.878 align:start position:0%
again today but suffice to say that we
 
05:40:01.350 --> 05:40:01.360 align:start position:0%
stand i think by the same testimony that
 
05:40:03.670 --> 05:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
we had last week on 1618 which is in
 
05:40:05.350 --> 05:40:05.360 align:start position:0%
opposition based on a number of
 
05:40:06.948 --> 05:40:06.958 align:start position:0%
technical issues which were described
 
05:40:08.788 --> 05:40:08.798 align:start position:0%
then and are described again in the
 
05:40:10.150 --> 05:40:10.160 align:start position:0%
letter that that you are about to
 
05:40:11.670 --> 05:40:11.680 align:start position:0%
receive from me
 
05:40:13.830 --> 05:40:13.840 align:start position:0%
so i'm not going to spell i'm not gonna
 
05:40:16.708 --> 05:40:16.718 align:start position:0%
belabor uh the the actual pfast
 
05:40:20.708 --> 05:40:20.718 align:start position:0%
compounds that i can't pronounce um
 
05:40:21.990 --> 05:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
but i will
 
05:40:25.910 --> 05:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
talk mostly just about how these maximum
 
05:40:28.788 --> 05:40:28.798 align:start position:0%
contaminant levels these mcls
 
05:40:31.030 --> 05:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
interact with our surface water quality
 
05:40:33.910 --> 05:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
regulations if they're put in as this
 
05:40:35.350 --> 05:40:35.360 align:start position:0%
bill would have
 
05:40:36.868 --> 05:40:36.878 align:start position:0%
us do
 
05:40:36.878 --> 05:40:38.070 align:start position:0%
us do
so

05:40:38.070 --> 05:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:40:40.230 --> 05:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
the way that this works is that we have
 
05:40:42.390 --> 05:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
a number of different mcls which are
 
05:40:42.400 --> 05:40:43.670 align:start position:0%
a number of different mcls which are
currently

05:40:43.670 --> 05:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
currently
 
05:40:45.830 --> 05:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
incorporated into our surface water
 
05:40:48.708 --> 05:40:48.718 align:start position:0%
quality regulations you will find our
 
05:40:51.910 --> 05:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
surface water quality regulations at env
 
05:40:54.948 --> 05:40:54.958 align:start position:0%
wq 1700
 
05:40:57.750 --> 05:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
and there's long lists of chemicals
 
05:40:59.430 --> 05:40:59.440 align:start position:0%
which are regulated in our surface
 
05:41:02.150 --> 05:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
waters as well as other things like do
 
05:41:05.190 --> 05:41:05.200 align:start position:0%
dissolved oxygen and ph and um other
 
05:41:08.868 --> 05:41:08.878 align:start position:0%
things that we find in the water so
 
05:41:11.830 --> 05:41:11.840 align:start position:0%
these become essentially the law and the
 
05:41:13.510 --> 05:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
way that it works is that when we
 
05:41:16.150 --> 05:41:16.160 align:start position:0%
approve them we also then send them not
 
05:41:20.070 --> 05:41:20.080 align:start position:0%
onto epa and we ask epa to approve them
 
05:41:22.230 --> 05:41:22.240 align:start position:0%
and when epa approves them they become
 
05:41:24.868 --> 05:41:24.878 align:start position:0%
also not only state law but they
 
05:41:27.350 --> 05:41:27.360 align:start position:0%
essentially become federal law as well
 
05:41:30.708 --> 05:41:30.718 align:start position:0%
so that's really helpful for a number of
 
05:41:33.270 --> 05:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
different you know regulatory things
 
05:41:36.230 --> 05:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
especially things like writing permits
 
05:41:38.470 --> 05:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
so for people who want to discharge into
 
05:41:40.070 --> 05:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
the waters of the united states they
 
05:41:42.390 --> 05:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
have to get a discharge permit
 
05:41:44.150 --> 05:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
and so epa
 
05:41:47.510 --> 05:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
uses our water quality standards
 
05:41:50.548 --> 05:41:50.558 align:start position:0%
to determine how much of whatever
 
05:41:52.628 --> 05:41:52.638 align:start position:0%
contaminant can be discharged into the
 
05:41:52.638 --> 05:41:53.910 align:start position:0%
contaminant can be discharged into the
environment

05:41:53.910 --> 05:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
environment
 
05:41:55.990 --> 05:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
so that's all just going to prelude into
 
05:41:57.590 --> 05:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
talking a little bit about the
 
05:41:59.670 --> 05:41:59.680 align:start position:0%
interaction between water quality
 
05:42:02.548 --> 05:42:02.558 align:start position:0%
standards and how this gets regulated uh
 
05:42:03.990 --> 05:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
at least by the feds and also
 
05:42:07.350 --> 05:42:07.360 align:start position:0%
potentially by state
 
05:42:09.750 --> 05:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
so the way that we used mcls generally
 
05:42:11.750 --> 05:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
is if we don't have another number
 
05:42:14.230 --> 05:42:14.240 align:start position:0%
that's in our surface water quality
 
05:42:17.190 --> 05:42:17.200 align:start position:0%
standards so we will often have an mcl
 
05:42:18.310 --> 05:42:18.320 align:start position:0%
that comes from the drinking water
 
05:42:18.320 --> 05:42:19.430 align:start position:0%
that comes from the drinking water
program

05:42:19.430 --> 05:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
program
 
05:42:21.910 --> 05:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
those are mcl's which were approved
 
05:42:24.310 --> 05:42:24.320 align:start position:0%
through rules the rule making process
 
05:42:26.470 --> 05:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
that the drinking water group goes
 
05:42:26.480 --> 05:42:27.590 align:start position:0%
that the drinking water group goes
through

05:42:27.590 --> 05:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
through
 
05:42:29.670 --> 05:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
and what we do is that when we go and
 
05:42:32.868 --> 05:42:32.878 align:start position:0%
review our our rules the 1700 rules
 
05:42:35.750 --> 05:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
we'll find those mcls we'll come we'll
 
05:42:37.270 --> 05:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
bring them in
 
05:42:39.190 --> 05:42:39.200 align:start position:0%
and then they become part of our surface
 
05:42:40.948 --> 05:42:40.958 align:start position:0%
water regulations
 
05:42:42.548 --> 05:42:42.558 align:start position:0%
and the important thing to remember is
 
05:42:44.548 --> 05:42:44.558 align:start position:0%
that they only apply
 
05:42:47.110 --> 05:42:47.120 align:start position:0%
to waters which are
 
05:42:48.390 --> 05:42:48.400 align:start position:0%
20 miles
 
05:42:50.628 --> 05:42:50.638 align:start position:0%
upstream within 20 miles upstream of a
 
05:42:52.788 --> 05:42:52.798 align:start position:0%
surface water intake
 
05:42:55.350 --> 05:42:55.360 align:start position:0%
so let's say that again because the mcls
 
05:42:57.430 --> 05:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
that we adopt into our water quality
 
05:42:57.440 --> 05:42:58.470 align:start position:0%
that we adopt into our water quality
standards

05:42:58.470 --> 05:42:58.480 align:start position:0%
standards
 
05:43:01.350 --> 05:43:01.360 align:start position:0%
apply only to those waters which are 20
 
05:43:04.868 --> 05:43:04.878 align:start position:0%
miles upstream of surface water intakes
 
05:43:06.708 --> 05:43:06.718 align:start position:0%
there's a good reason for that the
 
05:43:08.548 --> 05:43:08.558 align:start position:0%
reason is is because the mcls are based
 
05:43:09.830 --> 05:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
on drinking water they're based on
 
05:43:12.310 --> 05:43:12.320 align:start position:0%
people drinking that water so you would
 
05:43:14.230 --> 05:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
want them to apply to waters that are
 
05:43:16.708 --> 05:43:16.718 align:start position:0%
potentially going to be drunk drank
 
05:43:16.718 --> 05:43:17.670 align:start position:0%
potentially going to be drunk drank
drunk

05:43:17.670 --> 05:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
drunk
 
05:43:17.680 --> 05:43:19.750 align:start position:0%
drunk
um

05:43:19.750 --> 05:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:43:21.910 --> 05:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
so given that that's how these these
 
05:43:23.430 --> 05:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
gonna apply so i wanted that to be
 
05:43:25.590 --> 05:43:25.600 align:start position:0%
really clear because if if we talk about
 
05:43:28.070 --> 05:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
applying these mcl's elsewhere
 
05:43:30.868 --> 05:43:30.878 align:start position:0%
to other waters waters that are not
 
05:43:31.750 --> 05:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
05:43:35.430 --> 05:43:35.440 align:start position:0%
potentially drinking water sources
 
05:43:35.440 --> 05:43:36.548 align:start position:0%
potentially drinking water sources
then

05:43:36.548 --> 05:43:36.558 align:start position:0%
then
 
05:43:38.230 --> 05:43:38.240 align:start position:0%
they don't apply there so i just want to
 
05:43:39.190 --> 05:43:39.200 align:start position:0%
make sure that that's really clear
 
05:43:41.190 --> 05:43:41.200 align:start position:0%
because it is a subset of the of the
 
05:43:42.948 --> 05:43:42.958 align:start position:0%
waters of the state which would be
 
05:43:44.788 --> 05:43:44.798 align:start position:0%
applicable here
 
05:43:46.548 --> 05:43:46.558 align:start position:0%
it is a significant
 
05:43:46.558 --> 05:43:47.670 align:start position:0%
it is a significant
subset

05:43:47.670 --> 05:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
subset
 
05:43:51.430 --> 05:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
uh we know that there are approximately
 
05:43:54.230 --> 05:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
35 or 32
 
05:43:55.990 --> 05:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plants municipal
 
05:43:57.830 --> 05:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plants which fall
 
05:44:00.150 --> 05:44:00.160 align:start position:0%
within those that zone
 
05:44:02.708 --> 05:44:02.718 align:start position:0%
we also know that there's probably 35
 
05:44:05.270 --> 05:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
municipal dis or industrial discharges
 
05:44:07.270 --> 05:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
which are permitted that are in that
 
05:44:09.830 --> 05:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
area that are 20 miles upstream of of
 
05:44:09.840 --> 05:44:10.830 align:start position:0%
area that are 20 miles upstream of of
water

05:44:10.830 --> 05:44:10.840 align:start position:0%
water
 
05:44:14.548 --> 05:44:14.558 align:start position:0%
intakes so like i said in the past we
 
05:44:17.030 --> 05:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
have adopted the mcls that come out of
 
05:44:19.110 --> 05:44:19.120 align:start position:0%
our drinking water program we bring them
 
05:44:21.030 --> 05:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
into our surface waters they go through
 
05:44:23.910 --> 05:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
the process they get adopted by epa they
 
05:44:26.470 --> 05:44:26.480 align:start position:0%
become enforceable law
 
05:44:29.510 --> 05:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
we are right now as a result of the work
 
05:44:32.310 --> 05:44:32.320 align:start position:0%
that was done on the mcls for the four
 
05:44:34.310 --> 05:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
contaminants which you are well well
 
05:44:36.470 --> 05:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
aware of the four contaminants for which
 
05:44:38.708 --> 05:44:38.718 align:start position:0%
we already have mcls
 
05:44:40.548 --> 05:44:40.558 align:start position:0%
we are in the process right now of
 
05:44:43.110 --> 05:44:43.120 align:start position:0%
writing writing those rules
 
05:44:44.470 --> 05:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
by april
 
05:44:46.548 --> 05:44:46.558 align:start position:0%
you all will see well if you're watching
 
05:44:48.548 --> 05:44:48.558 align:start position:0%
the rule making you'll see an initial
 
05:44:51.510 --> 05:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
proposal from us which will bring in
 
05:44:53.510 --> 05:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
those mcls into our surface water
 
05:44:55.190 --> 05:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
quality standards
 
05:44:56.788 --> 05:44:56.798 align:start position:0%
and that's the way that we prefer to do
 
05:44:58.628 --> 05:44:58.638 align:start position:0%
it which is why we're really opposed to
 
05:45:00.708 --> 05:45:00.718 align:start position:0%
this bill is because we think that the
 
05:45:02.470 --> 05:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
way that this should work is that that
 
05:45:04.310 --> 05:45:04.320 align:start position:0%
we should follow that process that
 
05:45:06.310 --> 05:45:06.320 align:start position:0%
process that we've used for very many
 
05:45:06.320 --> 05:45:07.190 align:start position:0%
process that we've used for very many
years

05:45:07.190 --> 05:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
years
 
05:45:09.670 --> 05:45:09.680 align:start position:0%
to bring mcl's into our surface water
 
05:45:11.510 --> 05:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
quality standards
 
05:45:13.110 --> 05:45:13.120 align:start position:0%
and interestingly enough because our
 
05:45:14.948 --> 05:45:14.958 align:start position:0%
surface water quality standards have a
 
05:45:16.788 --> 05:45:16.798 align:start position:0%
nexus with federal law with the clean
 
05:45:18.230 --> 05:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
water act
 
05:45:21.510 --> 05:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
we also have by law have to review our
 
05:45:23.990 --> 05:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
laws every three years review our water
 
05:45:25.990 --> 05:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
quality standards every three years so
 
05:45:28.390 --> 05:45:28.400 align:start position:0%
we're always looking for what is the new
 
05:45:30.150 --> 05:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
science what is the new guidance from
 
05:45:31.590 --> 05:45:31.600 align:start position:0%
the federal government
 
05:45:33.510 --> 05:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
so these are periodically updated and
 
05:45:35.910 --> 05:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
will be periodically updated as the
 
05:45:38.868 --> 05:45:38.878 align:start position:0%
government especially as as epa comes
 
05:45:40.470 --> 05:45:40.480 align:start position:0%
out with new guidance and we're
 
05:45:43.270 --> 05:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
expecting guidance on pfas chemicals
 
05:45:45.430 --> 05:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
within the next couple of years from epa
 
05:45:45.440 --> 05:45:46.628 align:start position:0%
within the next couple of years from epa
anyway

05:45:46.628 --> 05:45:46.638 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
05:45:48.868 --> 05:45:48.878 align:start position:0%
and again that's how we normally would
 
05:45:50.470 --> 05:45:50.480 align:start position:0%
bring these into our water quality
 
05:45:52.628 --> 05:45:52.638 align:start position:0%
standards again why we think that it's
 
05:45:55.030 --> 05:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
more appropriate for us to follow that
 
05:45:57.270 --> 05:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
rule making process rather than having
 
05:45:59.590 --> 05:45:59.600 align:start position:0%
them put into statute as you see in the
 
05:46:02.548 --> 05:46:02.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:05.270 --> 05:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
finally i think the rule making is uh
 
05:46:06.868 --> 05:46:06.878 align:start position:0%
and i was having a conversation with
 
05:46:08.070 --> 05:46:08.080 align:start position:0%
some wastewater treatment plant
 
05:46:10.548 --> 05:46:10.558 align:start position:0%
operators here out in the hall
 
05:46:12.708 --> 05:46:12.718 align:start position:0%
that um we want to hear from those
 
05:46:12.718 --> 05:46:13.990 align:start position:0%
that um we want to hear from those
people

05:46:13.990 --> 05:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
people
 
05:46:15.510 --> 05:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
and we will do that one of the things
 
05:46:16.788 --> 05:46:16.798 align:start position:0%
that we will do as part of our
 
05:46:18.310 --> 05:46:18.320 align:start position:0%
rulemaking making processes we will hold
 
05:46:20.310 --> 05:46:20.320 align:start position:0%
a special session just for those
 
05:46:23.190 --> 05:46:23.200 align:start position:0%
permitees who may be impacted by this
 
05:46:25.110 --> 05:46:25.120 align:start position:0%
rule to be able to give them the
 
05:46:26.470 --> 05:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
information that they would need in
 
05:46:28.390 --> 05:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
order to understand what are the
 
05:46:30.948 --> 05:46:30.958 align:start position:0%
implications of this on their facilities
 
05:46:33.510 --> 05:46:33.520 align:start position:0%
or their their town or their their
 
05:46:33.520 --> 05:46:34.470 align:start position:0%
or their their town or their their
business

05:46:34.470 --> 05:46:34.480 align:start position:0%
business
 
05:46:36.548 --> 05:46:36.558 align:start position:0%
so this is another important step that
 
05:46:38.230 --> 05:46:38.240 align:start position:0%
we will be taking
 
05:46:41.430 --> 05:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
in in our lead up to rule making on
 
05:46:43.750 --> 05:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
implementing these mcls
 
05:46:46.548 --> 05:46:46.558 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to stop there
 
05:46:48.948 --> 05:46:48.958 align:start position:0%
and open and see if anyone has any
 
05:46:51.590 --> 05:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
questions this is all a little technical
 
05:46:53.830 --> 05:46:53.840 align:start position:0%
and certainly the arcane world of water
 
05:46:56.070 --> 05:46:56.080 align:start position:0%
quality standards is not for the faint
 
05:46:58.708 --> 05:46:58.718 align:start position:0%
of heart so i appreciate the opportunity
 
05:47:01.030 --> 05:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
to be before you this afternoon and
 
05:47:03.110 --> 05:47:03.120 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions
 
05:47:05.150 --> 05:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
any questions by
 
05:47:08.788 --> 05:47:08.798 align:start position:0%
represent representative creighton
 
05:47:11.590 --> 05:47:11.600 align:start position:0%
yes sir again thank you so much
 
05:47:13.510 --> 05:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
not technical at all
 
05:47:15.910 --> 05:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
is the water we're drinking safe
 
05:47:15.920 --> 05:47:16.708 align:start position:0%
is the water we're drinking safe
uh

05:47:16.708 --> 05:47:16.718 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:47:18.548 --> 05:47:18.558 align:start position:0%
so that's a great question
 
05:47:21.110 --> 05:47:21.120 align:start position:0%
and the answer is that where we have
 
05:47:22.788 --> 05:47:22.798 align:start position:0%
been able to sample
 
05:47:24.868 --> 05:47:24.878 align:start position:0%
where we have we have sampled for pfas
 
05:47:26.788 --> 05:47:26.798 align:start position:0%
and surface waters
 
05:47:28.708 --> 05:47:28.718 align:start position:0%
and we have found certain surface waters
 
05:47:31.190 --> 05:47:31.200 align:start position:0%
that have high levels of pfas
 
05:47:32.788 --> 05:47:32.798 align:start position:0%
that is for certain
 
05:47:34.628 --> 05:47:34.638 align:start position:0%
we have found that most of the waters
 
05:47:36.150 --> 05:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
especially the waters that are used for
 
05:47:38.150 --> 05:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
drinking water we have not found high
 
05:47:39.990 --> 05:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
levels of pfas we have no reason to
 
05:47:40.000 --> 05:47:41.030 align:start position:0%
levels of pfas we have no reason to
believe

05:47:41.030 --> 05:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
believe
 
05:47:43.590 --> 05:47:43.600 align:start position:0%
that there is a problem with our surface
 
05:47:45.670 --> 05:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
waters relative to that at this point
 
05:47:47.590 --> 05:47:47.600 align:start position:0%
that people are drinking
 
05:47:49.670 --> 05:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
on top of that
 
05:47:52.628 --> 05:47:52.638 align:start position:0%
remember that these are also mcls these
 
05:47:54.548 --> 05:47:54.558 align:start position:0%
are already and you've heard this many
 
05:47:57.190 --> 05:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
many times that the drinking water
 
05:47:57.200 --> 05:47:58.788 align:start position:0%
many times that the drinking water
suppliers

05:47:58.788 --> 05:47:58.798 align:start position:0%
suppliers
 
05:48:00.868 --> 05:48:00.878 align:start position:0%
the people who are supplying water that
 
05:48:02.948 --> 05:48:02.958 align:start position:0%
is the water that's coming out of taps
 
05:48:05.430 --> 05:48:05.440 align:start position:0%
in public water supplies
 
05:48:07.750 --> 05:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
these mcls apply to them
 
05:48:09.670 --> 05:48:09.680 align:start position:0%
so they can't serve you regardless of
 
05:48:11.590 --> 05:48:11.600 align:start position:0%
whether that water was contaminated when
 
05:48:13.750 --> 05:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
it came in from the river
 
05:48:16.708 --> 05:48:16.718 align:start position:0%
they can't serve you that water
 
05:48:16.718 --> 05:48:17.430 align:start position:0%
they can't serve you that water
so

05:48:17.430 --> 05:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:48:20.708 --> 05:48:20.718 align:start position:0%
so that's the second level
 
05:48:20.718 --> 05:48:22.868 align:start position:0%
so that's the second level
of

05:48:22.868 --> 05:48:22.878 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:48:25.590 --> 05:48:25.600 align:start position:0%
of regulation here a protection here so
 
05:48:27.590 --> 05:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
so there's no reason to believe even if
 
05:48:28.948 --> 05:48:28.958 align:start position:0%
you did have
 
05:48:31.990 --> 05:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
say a slightly higher elevated level in
 
05:48:33.430 --> 05:48:33.440 align:start position:0%
the river and most of the rivers we've
 
05:48:36.390 --> 05:48:36.400 align:start position:0%
sampled are non-detect for pfas
 
05:48:36.400 --> 05:48:37.750 align:start position:0%
sampled are non-detect for pfas
um

05:48:37.750 --> 05:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:48:40.070 --> 05:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
even if you did you still would be it
 
05:48:41.670 --> 05:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
would be treated before it could go out
 
05:48:43.110 --> 05:48:43.120 align:start position:0%
to the public does that answer your
 
05:48:44.310 --> 05:48:44.320 align:start position:0%
question representative yes sir thank
 
05:48:48.628 --> 05:48:48.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:50.628 --> 05:48:50.638 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
05:48:53.270 --> 05:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry you you have a microphone
 
05:48:55.590 --> 05:48:55.600 align:start position:0%
you're going to save me hey
 
05:48:57.990 --> 05:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
chairperson i have a question you have a
 
05:48:59.590 --> 05:48:59.600 align:start position:0%
question representative cohen first
 
05:49:00.948 --> 05:49:00.958 align:start position:0%
question thank you for recognizing me
 
05:49:02.948 --> 05:49:02.958 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so in
 
05:49:05.510 --> 05:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
this particular bill there are can you
 
05:49:06.708 --> 05:49:06.718 align:start position:0%
hear me yeah
 
05:49:08.230 --> 05:49:08.240 align:start position:0%
in this particular bill there are
 
05:49:11.270 --> 05:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
several new uh pfast chemical
 
05:49:13.670 --> 05:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
identified right uh some of them right
 
05:49:16.788 --> 05:49:16.798 align:start position:0%
now do not have mcl levels
 
05:49:18.310 --> 05:49:18.320 align:start position:0%
with the work you're talking about are
 
05:49:20.788 --> 05:49:20.798 align:start position:0%
bringing surface water into mco will all
 
05:49:22.708 --> 05:49:22.718 align:start position:0%
of these be addressed that's a great
 
05:49:24.150 --> 05:49:24.160 align:start position:0%
question thank you representative cohen
 
05:49:26.788 --> 05:49:26.798 align:start position:0%
i appreciate that um no we will only be
 
05:49:28.548 --> 05:49:28.558 align:start position:0%
bringing in the mcls which have already
 
05:49:30.548 --> 05:49:30.558 align:start position:0%
been adopted through the rulemaking
 
05:49:32.470 --> 05:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
process through drinking water or in the
 
05:49:35.270 --> 05:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
case of the four that are in question
 
05:49:37.030 --> 05:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
here i believe this i believe that there
 
05:49:38.788 --> 05:49:38.798 align:start position:0%
was statutory language on those as well
 
05:49:38.798 --> 05:49:39.750 align:start position:0%
was statutory language on those as well
but

05:49:39.750 --> 05:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:49:41.270 --> 05:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
this would go through
 
05:49:42.948 --> 05:49:42.958 align:start position:0%
these would be the ones that are already
 
05:49:45.750 --> 05:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
in mcl already in rule
 
05:49:47.670 --> 05:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
that we would be applying as surface
 
05:49:48.868 --> 05:49:48.878 align:start position:0%
water quality standards they are
 
05:49:52.788 --> 05:49:52.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:52.798 --> 05:49:53.670 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:49:53.670 --> 05:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:49:55.110 --> 05:49:55.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for the clear does that make
 
05:49:55.120 --> 05:49:56.868 align:start position:0%
thank you for the clear does that make
sense

05:49:56.868 --> 05:49:56.878 align:start position:0%
sense
 
05:49:59.430 --> 05:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
can i answer that question
 
05:50:01.110 --> 05:50:01.120 align:start position:0%
i understand what you're saying i don't
 
05:50:02.628 --> 05:50:02.638 align:start position:0%
agree that it makes sense for the people
 
05:50:04.628 --> 05:50:04.638 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire but i do understand
 
05:50:06.230 --> 05:50:06.240 align:start position:0%
what you're saying right
 
05:50:08.230 --> 05:50:08.240 align:start position:0%
and i think you saw our testimony on the
 
05:50:09.990 --> 05:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
other two contaminants as well as
 
05:50:10.000 --> 05:50:11.030 align:start position:0%
other two contaminants as well as
combining

05:50:11.030 --> 05:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
combining
 
05:50:12.548 --> 05:50:12.558 align:start position:0%
and you know i think
 
05:50:13.990 --> 05:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
that's what i think you all are going to
 
05:50:16.628 --> 05:50:16.638 align:start position:0%
be considering yeah okay thank you very
 
05:50:21.430 --> 05:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:23.750 --> 05:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
are you continuing or is this or is that
 
05:50:23.760 --> 05:50:24.470 align:start position:0%
are you continuing or is this or is that
it

05:50:24.470 --> 05:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:50:26.310 --> 05:50:26.320 align:start position:0%
unless you have more questions i'm happy
 
05:50:28.830 --> 05:50:28.840 align:start position:0%

05:50:38.390 --> 05:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
why don't you keep these uh any on the
 
05:50:39.590 --> 05:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
next bill
 
05:50:41.510 --> 05:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
these are on the next
 
05:50:41.520 --> 05:50:46.230 align:start position:0%
these are on the next
okay

05:50:46.230 --> 05:50:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:46.240 --> 05:50:47.830 align:start position:0%
 
uh

05:50:47.830 --> 05:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:50:49.750 --> 05:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
let's see
 
05:50:56.230 --> 05:50:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:58.230 --> 05:50:58.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair nate grays for the
 
05:51:00.628 --> 05:51:00.638 align:start position:0%
new hampshire municipal association uh
 
05:51:05.430 --> 05:51:05.440 align:start position:0%
we do also oppose hb 11 1167 uh for
 
05:51:08.230 --> 05:51:08.240 align:start position:0%
basically all the same reasons that uh
 
05:51:10.070 --> 05:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
you've heard um
 
05:51:13.350 --> 05:51:13.360 align:start position:0%
already today um again we don't
 
05:51:16.788 --> 05:51:16.798 align:start position:0%
oppose any regulation of pfas chemicals
 
05:51:19.030 --> 05:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
we're just concerned about the costs um
 
05:51:21.510 --> 05:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
as mentioned des is very far along in
 
05:51:24.150 --> 05:51:24.160 align:start position:0%
the process of regulating the
 
05:51:27.110 --> 05:51:27.120 align:start position:0%
four chemicals that are named in statute
 
05:51:28.948 --> 05:51:28.958 align:start position:0%
and we would like that process to
 
05:51:30.548 --> 05:51:30.558 align:start position:0%
continue so they have the opportunity to
 
05:51:32.708 --> 05:51:32.718 align:start position:0%
talk with municipalities about the
 
05:51:32.718 --> 05:51:34.470 align:start position:0%
talk with municipalities about the
effects

05:51:34.470 --> 05:51:34.480 align:start position:0%
effects
 
05:51:37.030 --> 05:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
on the municipalities and wastewater
 
05:51:38.628 --> 05:51:38.638 align:start position:0%
treatment facilities
 
05:51:41.510 --> 05:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
and consider those in terms of the final
 
05:51:43.670 --> 05:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
rule making process
 
05:51:47.270 --> 05:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:49.270 --> 05:51:49.280 align:start position:0%

affordable and reliable drinking water
 
05:53:11.750 --> 05:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
and i understand that pfas are a real
 
05:53:14.070 --> 05:53:14.080 align:start position:0%
question and an issue for our state
 
05:53:15.750 --> 05:53:15.760 align:start position:0%
uh we're finding them everywhere there's
 
05:53:19.590 --> 05:53:19.600 align:start position:0%
certainly hot spots in merrimack and in
 
05:53:21.750 --> 05:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
portsmouth we all use them and now
 
05:53:25.110 --> 05:53:25.120 align:start position:0%
they're basically coming back to bite us
 
05:53:27.510 --> 05:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
in all sorts of uncomfortable places as
 
05:53:27.520 --> 05:53:28.230 align:start position:0%
in all sorts of uncomfortable places as
we

05:53:28.230 --> 05:53:28.240 align:start position:0%
we
 
05:53:30.708 --> 05:53:30.718 align:start position:0%
learn more about how toxic they are
 
05:53:32.868 --> 05:53:32.878 align:start position:0%
these numbers that we have the mcls that
 
05:53:35.430 --> 05:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
were established recently are incredibly
 
05:53:38.948 --> 05:53:38.958 align:start position:0%
low and i put that in my perspective of
 
05:53:41.030 --> 05:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
working in hazardous waste investigation
 
05:53:43.590 --> 05:53:43.600 align:start position:0%
and remediation for for decades starting
 
05:53:46.070 --> 05:53:46.080 align:start position:0%
with the des years ago so we're talking
 
05:53:47.990 --> 05:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
about incredibly low levels not to say
 
05:53:49.030 --> 05:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
that they're not
 
05:53:51.750 --> 05:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
not dangerous but i think i think the
 
05:53:55.350 --> 05:53:55.360 align:start position:0%
key point is when we establish new mcls
 
05:53:57.430 --> 05:53:57.440 align:start position:0%
new drinking water standards
 
05:53:59.670 --> 05:53:59.680 align:start position:0%
it's really worth putting the time in to
 
05:54:02.150 --> 05:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
use our toxicology and there's
 
05:54:04.390 --> 05:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
information coming out you know very
 
05:54:06.230 --> 05:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
almost on a daily basis
 
05:54:09.270 --> 05:54:09.280 align:start position:0%
to set standards because the standards
 
05:54:11.270 --> 05:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
then have implications
 
05:54:12.708 --> 05:54:12.718 align:start position:0%
from the drinking water side and
 
05:54:14.390 --> 05:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
actually from the customer side there's
 
05:54:16.150 --> 05:54:16.160 align:start position:0%
big costs involved and you've probably
 
05:54:18.548 --> 05:54:18.558 align:start position:0%
heard over the last few years what it
 
05:54:21.510 --> 05:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
costs to up you know grade a system like
 
05:54:24.548 --> 05:54:24.558 align:start position:0%
merrimack or aquarian or portsmouth to
 
05:54:26.150 --> 05:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
treat pfas
 
05:54:26.160 --> 05:54:27.350 align:start position:0%
treat pfas
and

05:54:27.350 --> 05:54:27.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:54:29.350 --> 05:54:29.360 align:start position:0%
well there's money coming to that and
 
05:54:31.110 --> 05:54:31.120 align:start position:0%
that's great essentially money that
 
05:54:33.190 --> 05:54:33.200 align:start position:0%
comes out of our pockets eventually the
 
05:54:34.390 --> 05:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
other thing that we're learning of
 
05:54:36.230 --> 05:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
course is the ongoing operation and
 
05:54:39.430 --> 05:54:39.440 align:start position:0%
maintenance of these systems and uh
 
05:54:40.868 --> 05:54:40.878 align:start position:0%
we don't know what those numbers are yet
 
05:54:43.030 --> 05:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
but because pfas is a forever chemical
 
05:54:45.270 --> 05:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
those numbers are going to be forever
 
05:54:47.750 --> 05:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
so again our association and our members
 
05:54:49.430 --> 05:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
are all about treating water and making
 
05:54:51.270 --> 05:54:51.280 align:start position:0%
it safe i would just say it's very
 
05:54:53.270 --> 05:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
important to use the you know the
 
05:54:56.230 --> 05:54:56.240 align:start position:0%
procedure to establish safe limits
 
05:54:58.628 --> 05:54:58.638 align:start position:0%
before we set them and then incorporate
 
05:55:00.070 --> 05:55:00.080 align:start position:0%
them into law
 
05:55:01.990 --> 05:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
um something else i wanted to add a
 
05:55:04.548 --> 05:55:04.558 align:start position:0%
little bit on we're using mcls and mr
 
05:55:06.390 --> 05:55:06.400 align:start position:0%
deers talked about using established
 
05:55:06.400 --> 05:55:07.590 align:start position:0%
deers talked about using established
mcls

05:55:07.590 --> 05:55:07.600 align:start position:0%
mcls
 
05:55:09.910 --> 05:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
to bring them into surface water
 
05:55:14.230 --> 05:55:14.240 align:start position:0%
standards but i would say that's a proxy
 
05:55:16.628 --> 05:55:16.638 align:start position:0%
if you look at and i didn't bring copies
 
05:55:18.470 --> 05:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
for everybody i didn't think of handing
 
05:55:20.390 --> 05:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
out copies of the letter i'm sorry i do
 
05:55:24.310 --> 05:55:24.320 align:start position:0%
have copies of my testimony but if if
 
05:55:25.750 --> 05:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
you're looking at surface water
 
05:55:28.150 --> 05:55:28.160 align:start position:0%
standards there's one two three four
 
05:55:30.628 --> 05:55:30.638 align:start position:0%
five six seven at least seven different
 
05:55:32.548 --> 05:55:32.558 align:start position:0%
levels that are looked at you know
 
05:55:34.628 --> 05:55:34.638 align:start position:0%
there's biological standards drinking
 
05:55:36.708 --> 05:55:36.718 align:start position:0%
direct contact uh
 
05:55:38.548 --> 05:55:38.558 align:start position:0%
plant standards it's incredibly
 
05:55:42.948 --> 05:55:42.958 align:start position:0%
complicated um so an mcl is is a proxy
 
05:55:44.310 --> 05:55:44.320 align:start position:0%
and if you're talking about a surface
 
05:55:46.788 --> 05:55:46.798 align:start position:0%
water standard it's a really uh even
 
05:55:48.470 --> 05:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
more detailed rigorous process because
 
05:55:50.788 --> 05:55:50.798 align:start position:0%
you're looking at health of even beyond
 
05:55:52.150 --> 05:55:52.160 align:start position:0%
people you're looking at ecological
 
05:55:54.470 --> 05:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
health so back to
 
05:55:54.480 --> 05:55:55.430 align:start position:0%
health so back to
let's

05:55:55.430 --> 05:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
let's
 
05:55:57.990 --> 05:55:58.000 align:start position:0%
let's use the science to drive the
 
05:55:59.990 --> 05:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
decisions on this because they have big
 
05:56:00.000 --> 05:56:01.670 align:start position:0%
decisions on this because they have big
implications

05:56:01.670 --> 05:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
implications
 
05:56:01.680 --> 05:56:02.948 align:start position:0%
implications
um

05:56:02.948 --> 05:56:02.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:56:02.958 --> 05:56:04.390 align:start position:0%
um
the

05:56:04.390 --> 05:56:04.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:56:06.788 --> 05:56:06.798 align:start position:0%
one other thing i wanted to touch on was
 
05:56:08.470 --> 05:56:08.480 align:start position:0%
there's a piece of reporting and i know
 
05:56:10.948 --> 05:56:10.958 align:start position:0%
this is fairly standard uh of reporting
 
05:56:13.190 --> 05:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
the agency reporting back on a piece of
 
05:56:14.788 --> 05:56:14.798 align:start position:0%
legislation and i understand that
 
05:56:17.350 --> 05:56:17.360 align:start position:0%
there's a desire uh for accountability
 
05:56:18.788 --> 05:56:18.798 align:start position:0%
you know and for information on the
 
05:56:22.548 --> 05:56:22.558 align:start position:0%
result of a new of a new rule
 
05:56:24.708 --> 05:56:24.718 align:start position:0%
mr dears pointed out that there is a
 
05:56:27.670 --> 05:56:27.680 align:start position:0%
regular review of epa mcls and other
 
05:56:30.548 --> 05:56:30.558 align:start position:0%
standards on a on an ongoing basis
 
05:56:32.830 --> 05:56:32.840 align:start position:0%
and i would
 
05:56:34.868 --> 05:56:34.878 align:start position:0%
suggest considering
 
05:56:37.030 --> 05:56:37.040 align:start position:0%
to ease up on
 
05:56:41.030 --> 05:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
two burdensome a reporting requirement
 
05:56:44.948 --> 05:56:44.958 align:start position:0%
and i do this i do this on behalf of the
 
05:56:47.190 --> 05:56:47.200 align:start position:0%
of the professionals that develop the
 
05:56:48.868 --> 05:56:48.878 align:start position:0%
standards and enforce the standards so i
 
05:56:51.670 --> 05:56:51.680 align:start position:0%
just wanted to say quickly uh
 
05:56:53.430 --> 05:56:53.440 align:start position:0%
i've worked for
 
05:56:57.110 --> 05:56:57.120 align:start position:0%
against and with the nhds over about 35
 
05:56:57.120 --> 05:56:58.150 align:start position:0%
against and with the nhds over about 35
years

05:56:58.150 --> 05:56:58.160 align:start position:0%
years
 
05:57:00.150 --> 05:57:00.160 align:start position:0%
as an employee as on the other side of
 
05:57:02.150 --> 05:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
the table on has waste site
 
05:57:03.910 --> 05:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
investigations and more recently in
 
05:57:06.948 --> 05:57:06.958 align:start position:0%
watershed protection in my current role
 
05:57:09.190 --> 05:57:09.200 align:start position:0%
i've got enormous respect and admiration
 
05:57:11.110 --> 05:57:11.120 align:start position:0%
for these professionals as i'm sure you
 
05:57:12.548 --> 05:57:12.558 align:start position:0%
do too
 
05:57:15.030 --> 05:57:15.040 align:start position:0%
they work understaffed they work with
 
05:57:17.110 --> 05:57:17.120 align:start position:0%
fast-moving stuff like pfas and all this
 
05:57:19.270 --> 05:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
federal money coming our way
 
05:57:21.430 --> 05:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
and they do it short staffed
 
05:57:23.190 --> 05:57:23.200 align:start position:0%
and they do it with a
 
05:57:25.990 --> 05:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
an ethic of service and so i would say
 
05:57:29.350 --> 05:57:29.360 align:start position:0%
if we can find ways to help them do that
 
05:57:32.070 --> 05:57:32.080 align:start position:0%
you know letting the processes play out
 
05:57:33.750 --> 05:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
focusing on what's most important for
 
05:57:34.948 --> 05:57:34.958 align:start position:0%
the people of new hampshire i think we'd
 
05:57:37.670 --> 05:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
all be better served so thank you very
 
05:57:39.590 --> 05:57:39.600 align:start position:0%
much for the time sorry about the second
 
05:57:42.390 --> 05:57:42.400 align:start position:0%
card i won't use it whatever it says
 
05:57:44.628 --> 05:57:44.638 align:start position:0%
and i will answer any of your questions
 
05:57:47.350 --> 05:57:47.360 align:start position:0%
if i if i can
 
05:57:50.150 --> 05:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
any questions from uh from the board
 
05:57:54.070 --> 05:57:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:55.750 --> 05:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
05:57:57.030 --> 05:57:57.040 align:start position:0%
you sir
 
05:58:06.310 --> 05:58:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:09.350 --> 05:58:09.360 align:start position:0%
uh if you have them we we
 
05:58:13.990 --> 05:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:14.000 --> 05:58:14.948 align:start position:0%
 
uh

05:58:14.948 --> 05:58:14.958 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:58:14.958 --> 05:58:15.910 align:start position:0%
uh
maybe

05:58:15.910 --> 05:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
05:58:29.430 --> 05:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:31.190 --> 05:58:31.200 align:start position:0%
representative boyd
 
05:58:33.830 --> 05:58:33.840 align:start position:0%
the floor is yours
 
05:58:35.830 --> 05:58:35.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and i
 
05:58:38.150 --> 05:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
sincerely apologize to the committee i
 
05:58:41.030 --> 05:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
no problem double booked 1 45 and 2 p.m
 
05:58:43.110 --> 05:58:43.120 align:start position:0%
it's happened to the best of us well the
 
05:58:46.628 --> 05:58:46.638 align:start position:0%
worst of us it's still in my first year
 
05:58:46.638 --> 05:58:47.910 align:start position:0%
worst of us it's still in my first year
uh

05:58:47.910 --> 05:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:58:50.948 --> 05:58:50.958 align:start position:0%
new legislature i'm learning about these
 
05:58:52.788 --> 05:58:52.798 align:start position:0%
these scheduling conflicts
 
05:58:54.628 --> 05:58:54.638 align:start position:0%
or issues so thank you mr chairman so i
 
05:58:56.390 --> 05:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
again i certainly through you
 
05:58:58.310 --> 05:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
uh to my inst to my esteemed colleagues
 
05:58:59.910 --> 05:58:59.920 align:start position:0%
at the general court
 
05:59:02.070 --> 05:59:02.080 align:start position:0%
um i come before you asking you to
 
05:59:04.548 --> 05:59:04.558 align:start position:0%
support house bill 1167
 
05:59:06.708 --> 05:59:06.718 align:start position:0%
which is a stat which establishes
 
05:59:09.430 --> 05:59:09.440 align:start position:0%
maximum containment limit for
 
05:59:13.190 --> 05:59:13.200 align:start position:0%
fluorinated chemicals in surface water
 
05:59:14.390 --> 05:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to
 
05:59:15.910 --> 05:59:15.920 align:start position:0%
repeat some of the
 
05:59:17.270 --> 05:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
things that i talked about last week
 
05:59:19.830 --> 05:59:19.840 align:start position:0%
because they're all analogous pfas is
 
05:59:19.840 --> 05:59:21.190 align:start position:0%
because they're all analogous pfas is
pfas

05:59:21.190 --> 05:59:21.200 align:start position:0%
pfas
 
05:59:22.548 --> 05:59:22.558 align:start position:0%
so some of the things that i had talked
 
05:59:24.310 --> 05:59:24.320 align:start position:0%
about regarding pfas last week are
 
05:59:26.230 --> 05:59:26.240 align:start position:0%
certainly going to be applicable
 
05:59:26.240 --> 05:59:27.430 align:start position:0%
certainly going to be applicable

um
 
05:59:29.750 --> 05:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
to to what we're talking about today i
 
05:59:32.470 --> 05:59:32.480 align:start position:0%
certainly want to acknowledge um
 
05:59:34.628 --> 05:59:34.638 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire waterworks association
 
05:59:37.270 --> 05:59:37.280 align:start position:0%
rivers management in des i certainly
 
05:59:37.280 --> 05:59:38.070 align:start position:0%
rivers management in des i certainly
read

05:59:38.070 --> 05:59:38.080 align:start position:0%
read
 
05:59:40.548 --> 05:59:40.558 align:start position:0%
what they've provided to this committee
 
05:59:42.948 --> 05:59:42.958 align:start position:0%
and what i would say at the onset
 
05:59:42.958 --> 05:59:45.350 align:start position:0%
and what i would say at the onset
is

05:59:45.350 --> 05:59:45.360 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:59:48.470 --> 05:59:48.480 align:start position:0%
should you choose not to move my bill
 
05:59:48.480 --> 05:59:49.750 align:start position:0%
should you choose not to move my bill
along

05:59:49.750 --> 05:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
along
 
05:59:51.670 --> 05:59:51.680 align:start position:0%
i am open-minded and flexible for
 
05:59:53.350 --> 05:59:53.360 align:start position:0%
whatever you feel is the appropriate
 
05:59:57.590 --> 05:59:57.600 align:start position:0%
next step legislatively as it relates to
 
06:00:00.470 --> 06:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
these six specific compounds
 
06:00:03.030 --> 06:00:03.040 align:start position:0%
whether it be through study or
 
06:00:03.040 --> 06:00:05.270 align:start position:0%
whether it be through study or
through

06:00:05.270 --> 06:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
through
 
06:00:06.470 --> 06:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
through other
 
06:00:08.788 --> 06:00:08.798 align:start position:0%
legislative means i certainly have an op
 
06:00:10.310 --> 06:00:10.320 align:start position:0%
have an open mind
 
06:00:13.110 --> 06:00:13.120 align:start position:0%
what i would point out is that
 
06:00:15.430 --> 06:00:15.440 align:start position:0%
there are 25 states
 
06:00:16.948 --> 06:00:16.958 align:start position:0%
that have
 
06:00:19.270 --> 06:00:19.280 align:start position:0%
that have specific standards where they
 
06:00:22.150 --> 06:00:22.160 align:start position:0%
uh have adopted the apa's lifetime
 
06:00:24.470 --> 06:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
advisory of 70 parts per trillion
 
06:00:26.788 --> 06:00:26.798 align:start position:0%
specifically as it relates to people on
 
06:00:29.590 --> 06:00:29.600 align:start position:0%
phos for groundwater screening
 
06:00:32.628 --> 06:00:32.638 align:start position:0%
excuse me for ground for for for
 
06:00:34.150 --> 06:00:34.160 align:start position:0%
drinking water out of those two out of
 
06:00:36.230 --> 06:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
those 25 there are 13
 
06:00:39.190 --> 06:00:39.200 align:start position:0%
that have adopted groundwater
 
06:00:41.590 --> 06:00:41.600 align:start position:0%
screening levels probably the one that
 
06:00:44.070 --> 06:00:44.080 align:start position:0%
that shocked me was texas
 
06:00:46.628 --> 06:00:46.638 align:start position:0%
texas has a very comprehensive
 
06:00:46.638 --> 06:00:48.310 align:start position:0%
texas has a very comprehensive
um

06:00:48.310 --> 06:00:48.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:00:51.910 --> 06:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
list of of um perfluorinated
 
06:00:54.070 --> 06:00:54.080 align:start position:0%
contaminants that they monitor
 
06:00:54.080 --> 06:00:54.868 align:start position:0%
contaminants that they monitor
um

06:00:54.868 --> 06:00:54.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:00:56.788 --> 06:00:56.798 align:start position:0%
specifically you know
 
06:00:59.830 --> 06:00:59.840 align:start position:0%
des has talked about the big four fosp
 
06:01:02.868 --> 06:01:02.878 align:start position:0%
foss pfna and hxs
 
06:01:05.030 --> 06:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
the two new ones that i'm looking to add
 
06:01:07.750 --> 06:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
to that are fba and fbs and
 
06:01:09.510 --> 06:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
texas for
 
06:01:12.310 --> 06:01:12.320 align:start position:0%
fba it's 71 000 parts per trillion for
 
06:01:17.190 --> 06:01:17.200 align:start position:0%
fbs it's 3 34 000 parts per trillion as
 
06:01:18.868 --> 06:01:18.878 align:start position:0%
the standard
 
06:01:20.948 --> 06:01:20.958 align:start position:0%
for those two particular
 
06:01:23.670 --> 06:01:23.680 align:start position:0%
surface water containments michigan
 
06:01:26.628 --> 06:01:26.638 align:start position:0%
washington ohio indiana
 
06:01:29.430 --> 06:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
also have set specific groundwater
 
06:01:31.270 --> 06:01:31.280 align:start position:0%
standards not just for
 
06:01:32.868 --> 06:01:32.878 align:start position:0%
the four that we're talking about but
 
06:01:35.350 --> 06:01:35.360 align:start position:0%
the two additional uh contaminants that
 
06:01:37.190 --> 06:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
i want to include
 
06:01:37.200 --> 06:01:40.708 align:start position:0%
i want to include
so

06:01:40.708 --> 06:01:40.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:42.628 --> 06:01:42.638 align:start position:0%
as we've identified
 
06:01:42.638 --> 06:01:44.070 align:start position:0%
as we've identified
um

06:01:44.070 --> 06:01:44.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:01:45.990 --> 06:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
these specific
 
06:01:48.628 --> 06:01:48.638 align:start position:0%
contaminants compounds
 
06:01:51.910 --> 06:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
ch choose your word um they're having uh
 
06:01:53.830 --> 06:01:53.840 align:start position:0%
in terms of environmental discharges all
 
06:01:56.310 --> 06:01:56.320 align:start position:0%
we know are having
 
06:01:58.470 --> 06:01:58.480 align:start position:0%
an impact on on people's on people's
 
06:02:01.750 --> 06:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
health and obviously having an impact on
 
06:02:04.948 --> 06:02:04.958 align:start position:0%
on quality of life issues so
 
06:02:06.628 --> 06:02:06.638 align:start position:0%
the ability to have
 
06:02:09.670 --> 06:02:09.680 align:start position:0%
a level of these specific particular of
 
06:02:12.868 --> 06:02:12.878 align:start position:0%
these six specific contaminants
 
06:02:15.350 --> 06:02:15.360 align:start position:0%
identified in my bill to me
 
06:02:18.708 --> 06:02:18.718 align:start position:0%
go far go above and beyond what the what
 
06:02:21.830 --> 06:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
the other states have done as it relates
 
06:02:24.470 --> 06:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
to establishing groundwater standards
 
06:02:25.990 --> 06:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
i really believe
 
06:02:28.150 --> 06:02:28.160 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire has a very unique
 
06:02:29.750 --> 06:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to take the lead in
 
06:02:29.760 --> 06:02:31.510 align:start position:0%
opportunity to take the lead in
establishing

06:02:31.510 --> 06:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
establishing
 
06:02:33.110 --> 06:02:33.120 align:start position:0%
we've we've done it for drinking water
 
06:02:34.548 --> 06:02:34.558 align:start position:0%
let's take the next step and do it for
 
06:02:36.708 --> 06:02:36.718 align:start position:0%
surface water because today's surface
 
06:02:38.070 --> 06:02:38.080 align:start position:0%
water is going to be tomorrow's drinking
 
06:02:40.310 --> 06:02:40.320 align:start position:0%
water um and i think there's a unique
 
06:02:43.430 --> 06:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity for for the state to be able
 
06:02:45.670 --> 06:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
to lead on this particular issue
 
06:02:47.110 --> 06:02:47.120 align:start position:0%
the last thing that i would point out to
 
06:02:49.430 --> 06:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
you is a 2019 report done by the state
 
06:02:52.470 --> 06:02:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:55.510 --> 06:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
what they did was they went to 11
 
06:02:57.430 --> 06:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
warm water
 
06:03:00.548 --> 06:03:00.558 align:start position:0%
bodies and out of the 11 they analyzed
 
06:03:02.948 --> 06:03:02.958 align:start position:0%
from out of the 11 they had 14
 
06:03:05.350 --> 06:03:05.360 align:start position:0%
extraction sites where they looked at a
 
06:03:07.110 --> 06:03:07.120 align:start position:0%
variety of different
 
06:03:09.430 --> 06:03:09.440 align:start position:0%
perforal chemicals
 
06:03:10.788 --> 06:03:10.798 align:start position:0%
not having
 
06:03:12.628 --> 06:03:12.638 align:start position:0%
established standards for surface water
 
06:03:14.628 --> 06:03:14.638 align:start position:0%
in new jersey
 
06:03:17.030 --> 06:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
the reports looked at both both surface
 
06:03:19.510 --> 06:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
water quality they also analyzed fist
 
06:03:22.628 --> 06:03:22.638 align:start position:0%
fish tissue um using a contaminant level
 
06:03:24.868 --> 06:03:24.878 align:start position:0%
of anywhere from a thousand parts per
 
06:03:27.350 --> 06:03:27.360 align:start position:0%
trillion to two thousand parts per train
 
06:03:29.670 --> 06:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
out of these 14 sites
 
06:03:32.788 --> 06:03:32.798 align:start position:0%
six chemicals that are listed in my bill
 
06:03:35.190 --> 06:03:35.200 align:start position:0%
the parts per trillion range
 
06:03:37.190 --> 06:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
went anywhere from 1100 parts per
 
06:03:40.390 --> 06:03:40.400 align:start position:0%
trillion to 10 200 parts per trillion
 
06:03:42.548 --> 06:03:42.558 align:start position:0%
now i'm kind of simplifying it for the
 
06:03:42.558 --> 06:03:43.830 align:start position:0%
now i'm kind of simplifying it for the
specific

06:03:43.830 --> 06:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
specific
 
06:03:46.390 --> 06:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
conversation there's a much more larger
 
06:03:48.230 --> 06:03:48.240 align:start position:0%
narrative that kind of flushes that out
 
06:03:51.030 --> 06:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
in more detail but new jersey's begun to
 
06:03:52.150 --> 06:03:52.160 align:start position:0%
take a look
 
06:03:54.230 --> 06:03:54.240 align:start position:0%
at at surface water quality as it
 
06:03:57.670 --> 06:03:57.680 align:start position:0%
relates um as it relates to fulfill
 
06:03:59.868 --> 06:03:59.878 align:start position:0%
contaminated excuse me
 
06:04:03.110 --> 06:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
fluorofluorochemicals so if anything the
 
06:04:05.830 --> 06:04:05.840 align:start position:0%
the new jersey report i think would be
 
06:04:09.350 --> 06:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
illustrative for new hampshire again to
 
06:04:10.868 --> 06:04:10.878 align:start position:0%
further build upon
 
06:04:12.708 --> 06:04:12.718 align:start position:0%
the the lead that we've taken as it
 
06:04:14.230 --> 06:04:14.240 align:start position:0%
relates to drinking water and actually
 
06:04:14.240 --> 06:04:15.750 align:start position:0%
relates to drinking water and actually
have

06:04:15.750 --> 06:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
have
 
06:04:18.150 --> 06:04:18.160 align:start position:0%
surface water quality standards that
 
06:04:20.390 --> 06:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
have some teeth in them so
 
06:04:22.150 --> 06:04:22.160 align:start position:0%
i will leave it at that again through
 
06:04:23.910 --> 06:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman to my esteemed
 
06:04:25.350 --> 06:04:25.360 align:start position:0%
colleagues of the general court thank
 
06:04:27.590 --> 06:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
you very much for hearing my testimony
 
06:04:29.350 --> 06:04:29.360 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for reading the bill
 
06:04:31.350 --> 06:04:31.360 align:start position:0%
and i'd be very gracious to answer any
 
06:04:33.430 --> 06:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
questions you may have
 
06:04:34.948 --> 06:04:34.958 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
06:04:37.910 --> 06:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
representative creighton
 
06:04:39.030 --> 06:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
06:04:41.190 --> 06:04:41.200 align:start position:0%
thank you sir for your testimony and and
 
06:04:43.510 --> 06:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
for your action to take care of our
 
06:04:46.070 --> 06:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
surface water and drinking water
 
06:04:48.868 --> 06:04:48.878 align:start position:0%
we just heard testimony from des
 
06:04:51.190 --> 06:04:51.200 align:start position:0%
and they're convinced that they have the
 
06:04:53.510 --> 06:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
systems in place to
 
06:04:57.190 --> 06:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
identify and to mitigate
 
06:04:59.590 --> 06:04:59.600 align:start position:0%
the the p-pass going into
 
06:05:01.270 --> 06:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
service and drinking water
 
06:05:03.990 --> 06:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
and so my my question is
 
06:05:04.000 --> 06:05:06.310 align:start position:0%
and so my my question is
uh

06:05:06.310 --> 06:05:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:08.548 --> 06:05:08.558 align:start position:0%
why is this bill necessary
 
06:05:11.750 --> 06:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh and how does it change the des
 
06:05:11.760 --> 06:05:12.948 align:start position:0%
uh and how does it change the des
position

06:05:12.948 --> 06:05:12.958 align:start position:0%
position
 
06:05:14.548 --> 06:05:14.558 align:start position:0%
with regard to that the only thing that
 
06:05:16.868 --> 06:05:16.878 align:start position:0%
i would change is that it would add fba
 
06:05:19.510 --> 06:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
and fbs to the equation right now based
 
06:05:22.070 --> 06:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
on the 2019 report that was issued to
 
06:05:25.670 --> 06:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
the legislature in 2020 the goal was on
 
06:05:28.548 --> 06:05:28.558 align:start position:0%
on the for the pfoa pfos
 
06:05:28.558 --> 06:05:29.830 align:start position:0%
on the for the pfoa pfos
um

06:05:29.830 --> 06:05:29.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:05:32.470 --> 06:05:32.480 align:start position:0%
hxss and god i'm doing a total point
 
06:05:35.270 --> 06:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
with all these letters i apologize the
 
06:05:36.470 --> 06:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
the fourth
 
06:05:38.948 --> 06:05:38.958 align:start position:0%
the fourth one uh fna excuse me
 
06:05:41.190 --> 06:05:41.200 align:start position:0%
um so they've identified those four i
 
06:05:41.200 --> 06:05:41.990 align:start position:0%
um so they've identified those four i
think

06:05:41.990 --> 06:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
think
 
06:05:44.548 --> 06:05:44.558 align:start position:0%
and and i i read commissioner scott's
 
06:05:46.628 --> 06:05:46.638 align:start position:0%
letter and i certainly appreciate that
 
06:05:47.750 --> 06:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
potentially there's a level of
 
06:05:49.750 --> 06:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
redundancy i guess
 
06:05:50.868 --> 06:05:50.878 align:start position:0%
my my
 
06:05:52.868 --> 06:05:52.878 align:start position:0%
suggestion back to you would be to
 
06:05:54.310 --> 06:05:54.320 align:start position:0%
include those two additional
 
06:05:55.990 --> 06:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
contaminants as a part as a part of the
 
06:05:57.750 --> 06:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
study as other states have already
 
06:05:59.750 --> 06:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
included those
 
06:06:01.990 --> 06:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
those two other contaminants new
 
06:06:04.708 --> 06:06:04.718 align:start position:0%
hampshire is only an act of four maybe
 
06:06:06.708 --> 06:06:06.718 align:start position:0%
let's be proactive on it on our end and
 
06:06:08.628 --> 06:06:08.638 align:start position:0%
let's look at those other two as a part
 
06:06:11.110 --> 06:06:11.120 align:start position:0%
of what was enacted and presented to the
 
06:06:13.910 --> 06:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
legislature back in 2020
 
06:06:15.270 --> 06:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i appreciate
 
06:06:15.280 --> 06:06:16.708 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i appreciate
it

06:06:16.708 --> 06:06:16.718 align:start position:0%
it
 
06:06:19.670 --> 06:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
06:06:22.390 --> 06:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
representative huff thank you mr
 
06:06:24.628 --> 06:06:24.638 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you representative
 
06:06:26.548 --> 06:06:26.558 align:start position:0%
boyd um
 
06:06:28.310 --> 06:06:28.320 align:start position:0%
in prior testimony
 
06:06:30.628 --> 06:06:30.638 align:start position:0%
um a few folks
 
06:06:32.150 --> 06:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
were opposed
 
06:06:34.470 --> 06:06:34.480 align:start position:0%
and they were opposed primarily not
 
06:06:37.110 --> 06:06:37.120 align:start position:0%
because of the idea of what it is that
 
06:06:39.270 --> 06:06:39.280 align:start position:0%
you're proposing not because of whether
 
06:06:40.548 --> 06:06:40.558 align:start position:0%
or not they thought it was a good idea
 
06:06:42.470 --> 06:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
or a bad idea but primarily it seemed to
 
06:06:44.230 --> 06:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
me because
 
06:06:46.230 --> 06:06:46.240 align:start position:0%
they want to go through the rule making
 
06:06:46.240 --> 06:06:49.190 align:start position:0%
they want to go through the rule making
process

06:06:49.190 --> 06:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:50.868 --> 06:06:50.878 align:start position:0%
i think the legislature should make the
 
06:06:50.878 --> 06:06:51.830 align:start position:0%
i think the legislature should make the
rules

06:06:51.830 --> 06:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
rules
 
06:06:55.430 --> 06:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
i agree so my question is
 
06:06:55.440 --> 06:06:56.150 align:start position:0%
i agree so my question is
is

06:06:56.150 --> 06:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:06:58.628 --> 06:06:58.638 align:start position:0%
if everybody seems to be on board maybe
 
06:07:02.150 --> 06:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
you could do this and just uh verify it
 
06:07:03.510 --> 06:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
that they're on board with what you're
 
06:07:06.150 --> 06:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
talking about then i don't see what the
 
06:07:08.708 --> 06:07:08.718 align:start position:0%
problem is that they would have so
 
06:07:11.110 --> 06:07:11.120 align:start position:0%
candidly and i hope i'm not speaking in
 
06:07:13.990 --> 06:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
in contempt of my friends in des what
 
06:07:15.350 --> 06:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
i'm about to say
 
06:07:15.360 --> 06:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
i'm about to say
um

06:07:15.680 --> 06:07:15.690 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:07:15.690 --> 06:07:16.868 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

06:07:16.868 --> 06:07:16.878 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:07:19.510 --> 06:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
in all candor i i did not have any kind
 
06:07:21.590 --> 06:07:21.600 align:start position:0%
of conversation with des
 
06:07:24.230 --> 06:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
about this bill outside of
 
06:07:26.628 --> 06:07:26.638 align:start position:0%
receiving commissioner scott's letter in
 
06:07:28.310 --> 06:07:28.320 align:start position:0%
some of the things that i've discussed
 
06:07:30.628 --> 06:07:30.638 align:start position:0%
with um some members of your of your
 
06:07:31.990 --> 06:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
committee that happened to live in my
 
06:07:32.000 --> 06:07:33.110 align:start position:0%
committee that happened to live in my
community

06:07:33.110 --> 06:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
community
 
06:07:33.120 --> 06:07:33.830 align:start position:0%
community
so

06:07:33.830 --> 06:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:07:37.430 --> 06:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
with that being said um
 
06:07:39.430 --> 06:07:39.440 align:start position:0%
and i've said this previously that
 
06:07:41.670 --> 06:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
anybody and everybody that works at des
 
06:07:43.830 --> 06:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
are are nothing less than the consummate
 
06:07:47.270 --> 06:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
professionals and they've been since
 
06:07:49.110 --> 06:07:49.120 align:start position:0%
merrimack and litchfield
 
06:07:50.788 --> 06:07:50.798 align:start position:0%
and londonderry have since we've been
 
06:07:53.750 --> 06:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
dealing with this issue now for coming
 
06:07:56.708 --> 06:07:56.718 align:start position:0%
up on close to close to 10 years um
 
06:07:58.948 --> 06:07:58.958 align:start position:0%
they've been very much engaged
 
06:08:03.020 --> 06:08:03.030 align:start position:0%
on analyzing the issue and beginning to
 
06:08:03.030 --> 06:08:04.230 align:start position:0%
on analyzing the issue and beginning to
[Music]

06:08:04.230 --> 06:08:04.240 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:08:06.070 --> 06:08:06.080 align:start position:0%
for the lack of a better word you know
 
06:08:08.548 --> 06:08:08.558 align:start position:0%
follow the follow the bouncing ball as
 
06:08:11.510 --> 06:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
to where it goes so
 
06:08:13.590 --> 06:08:13.600 align:start position:0%
i prefer a legislative solution they
 
06:08:15.190 --> 06:08:15.200 align:start position:0%
prefer a rulemaking
 
06:08:17.910 --> 06:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
resolution which again is news to me
 
06:08:19.510 --> 06:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day
 
06:08:19.520 --> 06:08:21.030 align:start position:0%

i think is is important for
 
06:10:37.030 --> 06:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
consideration by the community committee
 
06:10:39.510 --> 06:10:39.520 align:start position:0%

could you to begin could you pull the
 
06:10:58.390 --> 06:10:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:01.030 --> 06:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
as has been stated previously ds has
 
06:11:02.948 --> 06:11:02.958 align:start position:0%
advanced the plan
 
06:11:04.548 --> 06:11:04.558 align:start position:0%
to develop surface water quality
 
06:11:07.670 --> 06:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
standards for the same four p fast
 
06:11:09.750 --> 06:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh compounds that it has already
 
06:11:11.670 --> 06:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
established drinking water mcls and
 
06:11:14.548 --> 06:11:14.558 align:start position:0%
ambient groundwater quality standards
 
06:11:16.548 --> 06:11:16.558 align:start position:0%
work has been in progress on these
 
06:11:18.070 --> 06:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
standards since the legislative
 
06:11:20.230 --> 06:11:20.240 align:start position:0%
legislature mandated such action in
 
06:11:20.240 --> 06:11:22.230 align:start position:0%
legislature mandated such action in
2018.

06:11:22.230 --> 06:11:22.240 align:start position:0%
2018.
 
06:11:24.708 --> 06:11:24.718 align:start position:0%
the s continues with this work as it has
 
06:11:26.948 --> 06:11:26.958 align:start position:0%
committed considerable resources
 
06:11:28.948 --> 06:11:28.958 align:start position:0%
to acquire the necessary background
 
06:11:31.590 --> 06:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
information to support technically
 
06:11:34.628 --> 06:11:34.638 align:start position:0%
defensible standards
 
06:11:36.390 --> 06:11:36.400 align:start position:0%
given the considerable level of effort
 
06:11:38.868 --> 06:11:38.878 align:start position:0%
that the des has committed to date
 
06:11:40.788 --> 06:11:40.798 align:start position:0%
and continues to commit to fulfill its
 
06:11:44.948 --> 06:11:44.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:48.788 --> 06:11:48.798 align:start position:0%
of house bill 1167
 
06:11:51.430 --> 06:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
seems to be a premature action at this
 
06:11:53.750 --> 06:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
at this time
 
06:11:56.150 --> 06:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
we recommend that the committee consider
 
06:11:58.310 --> 06:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
allowing the administrative rulemaking
 
06:12:00.390 --> 06:12:00.400 align:start position:0%
process to proceed
 
06:12:02.310 --> 06:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
and giving the des the opportunity to
 
06:12:03.910 --> 06:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
complete its work
 
06:12:06.070 --> 06:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
under its original mandate by referring
 
06:12:09.110 --> 06:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
this bill to interim study
 
06:12:10.470 --> 06:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
and then
 
06:12:14.150 --> 06:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
as a final concern um
 
06:12:16.230 --> 06:12:16.240 align:start position:0%
related to the inclusion
 
06:12:18.628 --> 06:12:18.638 align:start position:0%
specifically of a combined numeric limit
 
06:12:19.910 --> 06:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
for the six
 
06:12:22.948 --> 06:12:22.958 align:start position:0%
pfas uh listed in this in this in the
 
06:12:22.958 --> 06:12:24.230 align:start position:0%
pfas uh listed in this in this in the
bill

06:12:24.230 --> 06:12:24.240 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:12:24.240 --> 06:12:25.270 align:start position:0%
bill
um

06:12:25.270 --> 06:12:25.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:12:27.590 --> 06:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
i would point out that that such a limit
 
06:12:30.230 --> 06:12:30.240 align:start position:0%
uh may create the misperception in the
 
06:12:30.240 --> 06:12:31.190 align:start position:0%
uh may create the misperception in the
minds

06:12:31.190 --> 06:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
minds
 
06:12:32.948 --> 06:12:32.958 align:start position:0%
of the general public
 
06:12:35.430 --> 06:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
that the four pfas mcls already
 
06:12:37.830 --> 06:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
established by the des
 
06:12:40.390 --> 06:12:40.400 align:start position:0%
on the basis of an extremely
 
06:12:42.470 --> 06:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
diligent examination
 
06:12:45.030 --> 06:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
of the available scientific research
 
06:12:47.110 --> 06:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
are not adequately protective of human
 
06:12:49.190 --> 06:12:49.200 align:start position:0%
health and the environment
 
06:12:51.510 --> 06:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
when in fact the department's
 
06:12:54.390 --> 06:12:54.400 align:start position:0%
toxicological evaluation determined that
 
06:12:56.310 --> 06:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
these established limits
 
06:12:59.110 --> 06:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
do in fact provide adequate protection i
 
06:13:00.628 --> 06:13:00.638 align:start position:0%
think this is a critical consideration
 
06:13:00.638 --> 06:13:01.750 align:start position:0%
think this is a critical consideration
because

06:13:01.750 --> 06:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
because
 
06:13:04.548 --> 06:13:04.558 align:start position:0%
i looked at the bill and i started doing
 
06:13:05.830 --> 06:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
the math
 
06:13:08.150 --> 06:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
especially with the first four listed
 
06:13:08.160 --> 06:13:10.070 align:start position:0%
especially with the first four listed
pfas

06:13:10.070 --> 06:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
pfas
 
06:13:10.080 --> 06:13:10.868 align:start position:0%
pfas
and

06:13:10.868 --> 06:13:10.878 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:13:13.350 --> 06:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
if you sum any one of those
 
06:13:15.510 --> 06:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
any pair of those uh four listed
 
06:13:15.520 --> 06:13:16.948 align:start position:0%
any pair of those uh four listed
compounds

06:13:16.948 --> 06:13:16.958 align:start position:0%
compounds
 
06:13:19.510 --> 06:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
you could be on the one hand considered
 
06:13:19.520 --> 06:13:20.390 align:start position:0%
you could be on the one hand considered
safe

06:13:20.390 --> 06:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
safe
 
06:13:22.230 --> 06:13:22.240 align:start position:0%
in that they would be they they would
 
06:13:23.990 --> 06:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
each be below
 
06:13:27.670 --> 06:13:27.680 align:start position:0%
the currently regulated limit but under
 
06:13:29.910 --> 06:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
this statute with this uh combined
 
06:13:32.070 --> 06:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
numeric limit they would all of a sudden
 
06:13:34.948 --> 06:13:34.958 align:start position:0%
be deemed unsafe and and that
 
06:13:36.788 --> 06:13:36.798 align:start position:0%
that's going to cause
 
06:13:39.350 --> 06:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
much confusion and concern among the
 
06:13:40.548 --> 06:13:40.558 align:start position:0%
general public
 
06:13:41.590 --> 06:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
so i
 
06:13:44.230 --> 06:13:44.240 align:start position:0%
i would request that or recommend that
 
06:13:46.150 --> 06:13:46.160 align:start position:0%
the committee take a serious look at
 
06:13:47.830 --> 06:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
that and if they have to go back to the
 
06:13:47.840 --> 06:13:49.030 align:start position:0%
that and if they have to go back to the
department

06:13:49.030 --> 06:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
department
 
06:13:52.470 --> 06:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
and and uh reevaluate that position uh i
 
06:13:55.750 --> 06:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
would i would so do that in terms of
 
06:13:59.270 --> 06:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
you know promoting public policy that is
 
06:14:01.350 --> 06:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
protective of of human health
 
06:14:03.510 --> 06:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
and clearly understood
 
06:14:04.390 --> 06:14:04.400 align:start position:0%
to be
 
06:14:06.948 --> 06:14:06.958 align:start position:0%
protective of human health
 
06:14:08.868 --> 06:14:08.878 align:start position:0%
with that mr chairman i thank you for
 
06:14:12.230 --> 06:14:12.240 align:start position:0%
your time and that concludes my comments
 
06:14:13.670 --> 06:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
any questions by members of the
 
06:14:13.680 --> 06:14:18.150 align:start position:0%

i'm gonna
 
06:14:34.240 --> 06:14:36.470 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna

thank you very much uh resources
 
06:15:28.548 --> 06:15:28.558 align:start position:0%
committee it's nice to be here again
 
06:15:30.628 --> 06:15:30.638 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is rosemarie rung
 
06:15:32.548 --> 06:15:32.558 align:start position:0%
i'm a representative from hillsborough

by now the committee knows a lot about

by now the committee knows a lot about

06:15:41.830 --> 06:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
pfas
 
06:15:44.070 --> 06:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
don't doubt you could pronounce it
 
06:15:45.190 --> 06:15:45.200 align:start position:0%
i'm waiting for you to draw the
 
06:15:48.070 --> 06:15:48.080 align:start position:0%
molecular structures
 
06:15:48.080 --> 06:15:49.110 align:start position:0%
molecular structures
but

06:15:49.110 --> 06:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:15:51.670 --> 06:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
one thing that you're aware of and which
 
06:15:53.510 --> 06:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of people in new hampshire become
 
06:15:54.708 --> 06:15:54.718 align:start position:0%
aware of is
 
06:15:57.190 --> 06:15:57.200 align:start position:0%
pfas are essentially indestructible
 
06:15:57.200 --> 06:15:58.868 align:start position:0%
pfas are essentially indestructible
molecules

06:15:58.868 --> 06:15:58.878 align:start position:0%
molecules
 
06:15:58.878 --> 06:15:59.750 align:start position:0%
molecules
they

06:15:59.750 --> 06:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
they
 
06:16:01.990 --> 06:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
bio accumulate in the environment and
 
06:16:04.868 --> 06:16:04.878 align:start position:0%
they also bioaccumulate in in human
 
06:16:07.670 --> 06:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
beings and in other animals
 
06:16:11.190 --> 06:16:11.200 align:start position:0%
in fact i just sent you a
 
06:16:13.990 --> 06:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
email with a report from that came out
 
06:16:16.390 --> 06:16:16.400 align:start position:0%
of des last fall
 
06:16:16.400 --> 06:16:17.670 align:start position:0%
of des last fall
that

06:16:17.670 --> 06:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:16:17.680 --> 06:16:18.948 align:start position:0%
that
studied

06:16:18.948 --> 06:16:18.958 align:start position:0%
studied
 
06:16:21.350 --> 06:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
pfas in fish
 
06:16:23.510 --> 06:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
and six advisories were issued about
 
06:16:26.310 --> 06:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
that time with do not eat and
 
06:16:29.590 --> 06:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
lowering the amount of servings of fish
 
06:16:32.708 --> 06:16:32.718 align:start position:0%
that they get from water bodies and from
 
06:16:34.708 --> 06:16:34.718 align:start position:0%
surface water so i'll get to that a
 
06:16:36.708 --> 06:16:36.718 align:start position:0%
little bit more later
 
06:16:39.030 --> 06:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
but the properties of pfas its
 
06:16:41.030 --> 06:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
environmental persistence and health
 
06:16:44.390 --> 06:16:44.400 align:start position:0%
impacts pose problems when it enters
 
06:16:47.430 --> 06:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
into a wastewater treatment plant
 
06:16:50.150 --> 06:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
for example in my town of merrimack we
 
06:16:52.868 --> 06:16:52.878 align:start position:0%
take an industrial waste and we take
 
06:16:56.150 --> 06:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
inceptage from many local communities
 
06:16:57.990 --> 06:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
the biosolids we
 
06:16:59.510 --> 06:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
the biosolid
 
06:17:02.070 --> 06:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
solids we generate
 
06:17:05.030 --> 06:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
from treating this waste is composted
 
06:17:07.750 --> 06:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
and it's sold as a soil amendment for
 
06:17:09.430 --> 06:17:09.440 align:start position:0%
public parks and other greenways
 
06:17:11.270 --> 06:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
throughout new england
 
06:17:13.350 --> 06:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
merrimack generates revenue from the
 
06:17:15.270 --> 06:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
sale of compost
 
06:17:17.910 --> 06:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
and this helps us to defray the cost of
 
06:17:20.708 --> 06:17:20.718 align:start position:0%
our wastewater treatment operations
 
06:17:23.670 --> 06:17:23.680 align:start position:0%
when pfas enters a wastewater
 
06:17:25.030 --> 06:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
treatment plant
 
06:17:26.868 --> 06:17:26.878 align:start position:0%
particularly from industrial or
 
06:17:29.110 --> 06:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
commercial sources it doesn't break down
 
06:17:30.628 --> 06:17:30.638 align:start position:0%
we know that
 
06:17:33.190 --> 06:17:33.200 align:start position:0%
in merrimack it either ends up in our
 
06:17:33.200 --> 06:17:34.708 align:start position:0%
in merrimack it either ends up in our
compost

06:17:34.708 --> 06:17:34.718 align:start position:0%
compost
 
06:17:36.788 --> 06:17:36.798 align:start position:0%
or in our discharge to the merrimack
 
06:17:36.798 --> 06:17:38.150 align:start position:0%
or in our discharge to the merrimack
river

06:17:38.150 --> 06:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
river
 
06:17:40.628 --> 06:17:40.638 align:start position:0%
either way we are spreading pfas
 
06:17:43.430 --> 06:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
contamination farther and wider into the
 
06:17:43.440 --> 06:17:45.270 align:start position:0%
contamination farther and wider into the
environment

06:17:45.270 --> 06:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
environment
 
06:17:48.390 --> 06:17:48.400 align:start position:0%
hp 1185 would enable wastewater
 
06:17:50.470 --> 06:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
treatment facilities to control the
 
06:17:53.110 --> 06:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
amount of pfas discharged into its
 
06:17:53.120 --> 06:17:54.230 align:start position:0%
amount of pfas discharged into its
facility

06:17:54.230 --> 06:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
facility
 
06:17:56.548 --> 06:17:56.558 align:start position:0%
and thus control the spread of pfas into
 
06:17:58.070 --> 06:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
the environment
 
06:17:59.670 --> 06:17:59.680 align:start position:0%
it would ensure that products of
 
06:18:02.310 --> 06:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment facility like our
 
06:18:05.030 --> 06:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
compost do not compound the problem of
 
06:18:06.708 --> 06:18:06.718 align:start position:0%
uncontrolled pfas
 
06:18:09.110 --> 06:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
spreading way beyond its source
 
06:18:13.190 --> 06:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
i ask that you recommend hp 11 at 1185
 
06:18:14.948 --> 06:18:14.958 align:start position:0%
for ought to pass
 
06:18:16.868 --> 06:18:16.878 align:start position:0%
and thank you and i'd be happy to answer
 
06:18:21.510 --> 06:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:23.350 --> 06:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
any questions for
 
06:18:24.628 --> 06:18:24.638 align:start position:0%

06:18:31.030 --> 06:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
smith
 
06:18:32.788 --> 06:18:32.798 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair for taking
 
06:18:34.708 --> 06:18:34.718 align:start position:0%
my question and thank you for being here
 
06:18:37.750 --> 06:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
today so my question is if
 
06:18:37.760 --> 06:18:40.230 align:start position:0%
today so my question is if
um

06:18:40.230 --> 06:18:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:43.350 --> 06:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
if the wastewater places get to
 
06:18:45.830 --> 06:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
turn away
 
06:18:47.110 --> 06:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
where does
 
06:18:50.150 --> 06:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
where does the contaminants go to
 
06:18:50.160 --> 06:18:50.948 align:start position:0%
where does the contaminants go to
well

06:18:50.948 --> 06:18:50.958 align:start position:0%
well
 
06:18:52.548 --> 06:18:52.558 align:start position:0%
i think the first
 
06:18:54.788 --> 06:18:54.798 align:start position:0%
option that
 
06:18:57.190 --> 06:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
producers of pfas would have is they'd
 
06:19:00.070 --> 06:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
have to decrease the amount of pfas
 
06:19:02.548 --> 06:19:02.558 align:start position:0%
that they generate into wastewater for
 
06:19:04.788 --> 06:19:04.798 align:start position:0%
example in merrimack
 
06:19:07.030 --> 06:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
we put a limit from senko bain the
 
06:19:08.868 --> 06:19:08.878 align:start position:0%
wastewater coming in from saint-cobain
 
06:19:10.830 --> 06:19:10.840 align:start position:0%
was high and it was contaminating our
 
06:19:12.708 --> 06:19:12.718 align:start position:0%
compost so
 
06:19:16.310 --> 06:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
we were able to require saint gobain to
 
06:19:18.948 --> 06:19:18.958 align:start position:0%
pre-treat their wastewater so they had
 
06:19:21.350 --> 06:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
to install filtration systems to remove
 
06:19:24.070 --> 06:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
the pfas before it entered so that is
 
06:19:27.110 --> 06:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
what i would expect other industrial
 
06:19:29.270 --> 06:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
manufacturing discharge
 
06:19:30.788 --> 06:19:30.798 align:start position:0%
um to be
 
06:19:33.110 --> 06:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
to to have to do is to pre-treat their
 
06:19:35.030 --> 06:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
their waste waste water
 
06:19:37.110 --> 06:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
now in merrimack situation and you'll
 
06:19:39.110 --> 06:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
hear more from the director of our
 
06:19:41.030 --> 06:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plant
 
06:19:43.910 --> 06:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
um sarita croci she just had to feed the
 
06:19:43.920 --> 06:19:45.990 align:start position:0%
um sarita croci she just had to feed the
meter

06:19:45.990 --> 06:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
meter
 
06:19:46.000 --> 06:19:46.948 align:start position:0%
meter
the

06:19:46.948 --> 06:19:46.958 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:19:46.958 --> 06:19:48.310 align:start position:0%
the
um

06:19:48.310 --> 06:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:19:48.320 --> 06:19:51.590 align:start position:0%
um
the

06:19:51.590 --> 06:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:53.590 --> 06:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
cinco bain is challenging our authority
 
06:19:56.468 --> 06:19:56.478 align:start position:0%
to do that because pfas
 
06:19:57.910 --> 06:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
and and i think you all got a letter
 
06:19:57.920 --> 06:19:58.788 align:start position:0%
and and i think you all got a letter
from

06:19:58.788 --> 06:19:58.798 align:start position:0%
from
 
06:20:01.270 --> 06:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner scott regarding the rsa
 
06:20:04.548 --> 06:20:04.558 align:start position:0%
that allows municipalities to
 
06:20:07.110 --> 06:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
regulate the discharge coming into their
 
06:20:08.868 --> 06:20:08.878 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plant
 
06:20:12.548 --> 06:20:12.558 align:start position:0%
but it's not explicit in statute that
 
06:20:15.350 --> 06:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
pfas can be would fall under this and
 
06:20:16.788 --> 06:20:16.798 align:start position:0%
that's the need that's the reason we
 
06:20:19.430 --> 06:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
have 1185 is to make it explicit in
 
06:20:22.708 --> 06:20:22.718 align:start position:0%
statute that municipalities are allowed
 
06:20:24.868 --> 06:20:24.878 align:start position:0%
to regulate pfas coming into wastewater
 
06:20:26.548 --> 06:20:26.558 align:start position:0%
treatment plants
 
06:20:28.468 --> 06:20:28.478 align:start position:0%
because presently that's not in statute
 
06:20:28.478 --> 06:20:32.150 align:start position:0%
because presently that's not in statute
anywhere

06:20:32.150 --> 06:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:33.990 --> 06:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
06:20:34.000 --> 06:20:35.510 align:start position:0%
follow up
so

06:20:35.510 --> 06:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:20:35.520 --> 06:20:36.468 align:start position:0%
so
how

06:20:36.468 --> 06:20:36.478 align:start position:0%
how
 
06:20:36.478 --> 06:20:37.350 align:start position:0%
how
um

06:20:37.350 --> 06:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:20:40.230 --> 06:20:40.240 align:start position:0%
difficult question so so what when they
 
06:20:44.230 --> 06:20:44.240 align:start position:0%
clean it through water a water system
 
06:20:45.750 --> 06:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
is that then
 
06:20:47.110 --> 06:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
let out
 
06:20:49.990 --> 06:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
into the air i know that was one of the
 
06:20:52.628 --> 06:20:52.638 align:start position:0%
things they were doing to mitigate
 
06:20:54.708 --> 06:20:54.718 align:start position:0%
pfas right was put it through a water
 
06:20:54.718 --> 06:20:55.990 align:start position:0%
pfas right was put it through a water
system

06:20:55.990 --> 06:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
system
 
06:20:58.070 --> 06:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
yeah typically um
 
06:20:59.750 --> 06:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
and especially for industrial
 
06:21:01.990 --> 06:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
manufacturers that have to
 
06:21:05.670 --> 06:21:05.680 align:start position:0%
remove pfas from a type of a dischargers
 
06:21:07.910 --> 06:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
maybe in their process somehow they
 
06:21:09.670 --> 06:21:09.680 align:start position:0%
usually will pass it through
 
06:21:13.030 --> 06:21:13.040 align:start position:0%
a granulated activated carbon filter so
 
06:21:15.830 --> 06:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
it's essentially a big cylinder packed
 
06:21:18.628 --> 06:21:18.638 align:start position:0%
with granulated activated carbon that
 
06:21:21.270 --> 06:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
absorbs the the pfas molecules from
 
06:21:22.708 --> 06:21:22.718 align:start position:0%
what's coming in
 
06:21:25.350 --> 06:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
and eventually that filter is going to
 
06:21:27.830 --> 06:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
be saturated and will have to be
 
06:21:30.390 --> 06:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
removed and replaced
 
06:21:33.510 --> 06:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
the removal of those that's called gak
 
06:21:35.670 --> 06:21:35.680 align:start position:0%
filters they'll they go to a special
 
06:21:39.670 --> 06:21:39.680 align:start position:0%
facility to have the pfas removed um
 
06:21:42.150 --> 06:21:42.160 align:start position:0%
i don't know exactly for sure but i
 
06:21:44.868 --> 06:21:44.878 align:start position:0%
would i would guess that um since the
 
06:21:46.868 --> 06:21:46.878 align:start position:0%
only way to get rid of pfas is to
 
06:21:48.628 --> 06:21:48.638 align:start position:0%
incinerate it at a very very high
 
06:21:50.868 --> 06:21:50.878 align:start position:0%
temperature they would expose that
 
06:21:52.390 --> 06:21:52.400 align:start position:0%
filter to those high temperatures to
 
06:21:53.990 --> 06:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
remove it
 
06:21:54.000 --> 06:21:54.948 align:start position:0%
remove it
the

06:21:54.948 --> 06:21:54.958 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:21:56.628 --> 06:21:56.638 align:start position:0%
the result
 
06:21:59.110 --> 06:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
the resulting
 
06:22:01.590 --> 06:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
products of that incineration
 
06:22:04.150 --> 06:22:04.160 align:start position:0%
would be much smaller molecules the the
 
06:22:06.628 --> 06:22:06.638 align:start position:0%
the fluorine that's in in a pfast
 
06:22:08.628 --> 06:22:08.638 align:start position:0%
molecule would be converted to hydrogen
 
06:22:13.030 --> 06:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
fluoride and and would be discharged
 
06:22:15.270 --> 06:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
and it would probably go to air
 
06:22:17.990 --> 06:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
and hopefully there would be a scrubber
 
06:22:21.350 --> 06:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
system so that we take the hf out of the
 
06:22:25.670 --> 06:22:25.680 align:start position:0%
um the gas phase of the uh incinerator
 
06:22:25.680 --> 06:22:26.628 align:start position:0%
um the gas phase of the uh incinerator
and

06:22:26.628 --> 06:22:26.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:22:28.390 --> 06:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
scrub it through a liquid
 
06:22:31.190 --> 06:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
that then can be appropriately
 
06:22:31.200 --> 06:22:33.990 align:start position:0%
that then can be appropriately
um

06:22:33.990 --> 06:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:35.910 --> 06:22:35.920 align:start position:0%
i don't know why i'm just looking
 
06:22:37.910 --> 06:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
can be appropriately treated typically
 
06:22:42.468 --> 06:22:42.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:42.478 --> 06:22:51.910 align:start position:0%
 
yes

06:22:51.910 --> 06:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:54.390 --> 06:22:54.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
06:22:56.390 --> 06:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
actually i believe representative wrong
 
06:22:58.868 --> 06:22:58.878 align:start position:0%
you already answered my questions um
 
06:23:01.110 --> 06:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
because i was going to say this is a
 
06:23:05.030 --> 06:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
may require not a shall require
 
06:23:07.270 --> 06:23:07.280 align:start position:0%
and you said that saint cobain
 
06:23:10.390 --> 06:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
argues that merrimack cannot do that and
 
06:23:11.590 --> 06:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
that's why the reason for the
 
06:23:13.510 --> 06:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
legislation am i correct
 
06:23:15.510 --> 06:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
that is true and i'll i'll have ms
 
06:23:17.590 --> 06:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
crocie speak more to that
 
06:23:17.600 --> 06:23:18.468 align:start position:0%
crocie speak more to that
but

06:23:18.468 --> 06:23:18.478 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:23:20.628 --> 06:23:20.638 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that that
 
06:23:23.750 --> 06:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
legislation that's currently in in
 
06:23:26.468 --> 06:23:26.478 align:start position:0%
statute that allows municipalities to
 
06:23:26.478 --> 06:23:27.830 align:start position:0%
statute that allows municipalities to
regulate

06:23:27.830 --> 06:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
regulate
 
06:23:30.390 --> 06:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
um things that come into their their
 
06:23:30.400 --> 06:23:31.430 align:start position:0%
um things that come into their their
plant

06:23:31.430 --> 06:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
plant
 
06:23:35.030 --> 06:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't specify pfas and that's
 
06:23:37.270 --> 06:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
the legal challenge that's being
 
06:23:38.708 --> 06:23:38.718 align:start position:0%
presented by
 
06:23:41.590 --> 06:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
saint-gobain great thank you yeah
 
06:23:44.230 --> 06:23:44.240 align:start position:0%
representative harp for a question
 
06:23:45.990 --> 06:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
 
06:23:46.000 --> 06:23:46.948 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
question

06:23:46.948 --> 06:23:46.958 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:23:46.958 --> 06:23:48.070 align:start position:0%
question
um

06:23:48.070 --> 06:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:23:49.910 --> 06:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
as you know being an attorney i look at
 
06:23:52.948 --> 06:23:52.958 align:start position:0%
these very specifically and did you mean
 
06:23:55.110 --> 06:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
this statute to cover
 
06:23:57.510 --> 06:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
uh septic haulers that haul from
 
06:24:00.310 --> 06:24:00.320 align:start position:0%
residential septic systems not really
 
06:24:03.990 --> 06:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
miss crotchet can speak more to that but
 
06:24:06.708 --> 06:24:06.718 align:start position:0%
for instance car washes
 
06:24:09.830 --> 06:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
often use septic haulers and we find
 
06:24:12.390 --> 06:24:12.400 align:start position:0%
that there's a lot of pfas in car wash
 
06:24:14.468 --> 06:24:14.478 align:start position:0%
discharge because of that undercoating
 
06:24:16.708 --> 06:24:16.718 align:start position:0%
when they say teflon protection
 
06:24:19.670 --> 06:24:19.680 align:start position:0%
they're spraying the cars with pfas
 
06:24:22.868 --> 06:24:22.878 align:start position:0%
that liquid is collected and once it's
 
06:24:24.868 --> 06:24:24.878 align:start position:0%
removed from the site of the car wash
 
06:24:27.590 --> 06:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
they use a septic hauler the intent is
 
06:24:30.548 --> 06:24:30.558 align:start position:0%
not to regulate
 
06:24:33.270 --> 06:24:33.280 align:start position:0%
residential users and typically
 
06:24:36.548 --> 06:24:36.558 align:start position:0%
residential users are
 
06:24:38.548 --> 06:24:38.558 align:start position:0%
deceptive is collected from all
 
06:24:40.948 --> 06:24:40.958 align:start position:0%
residential users it's not
 
06:24:43.590 --> 06:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
separated i mean it's not combined with
 
06:24:46.310 --> 06:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
industrial manufacturing septage so
 
06:24:48.788 --> 06:24:48.798 align:start position:0%
that's that would be the approach that
 
06:24:51.830 --> 06:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
regulating would apply to septage coming
 
06:24:53.510 --> 06:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
from um
 
06:24:58.150 --> 06:24:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:00.708 --> 06:25:00.718 align:start position:0%
follow-up for a follow-up so if this
 
06:25:03.750 --> 06:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
happened upon you have no objection to a
 
06:25:07.270 --> 06:25:07.280 align:start position:0%
reference that specifies septic hollers
 
06:25:09.750 --> 06:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
of industrial or commercial
 
06:25:12.468 --> 06:25:12.478 align:start position:0%
i i would i would have no uh objection
 
06:25:15.190 --> 06:25:15.200 align:start position:0%
to that and i think um ms croche can
 
06:25:18.708 --> 06:25:18.718 align:start position:0%
speak more specifically because
 
06:25:20.628 --> 06:25:20.638 align:start position:0%
her plant actually accepts all that
 
06:25:22.628 --> 06:25:22.638 align:start position:0%
acceptance she she she knows what's
 
06:25:24.948 --> 06:25:24.958 align:start position:0%
coming in directly from septic
 
06:25:28.150 --> 06:25:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:33.350 --> 06:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
anyone else for the question from
 
06:25:34.628 --> 06:25:34.638 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
06:25:36.070 --> 06:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
if not thank you very much thank you
 
06:25:41.510 --> 06:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:43.670 --> 06:25:43.680 align:start position:0%
now there are
 
06:25:45.030 --> 06:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
there are
 
06:25:45.040 --> 06:25:46.868 align:start position:0%
there are
several

06:25:46.868 --> 06:25:46.878 align:start position:0%
several
 
06:25:46.878 --> 06:25:48.788 align:start position:0%
several
co-sponsors

06:25:48.788 --> 06:25:48.798 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors
 
06:25:51.190 --> 06:25:51.200 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
06:25:53.590 --> 06:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
who are on this committee
 
06:25:55.670 --> 06:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
if you wish to speak on it
 
06:25:59.990 --> 06:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
you have to go to the front and okay
 
06:26:02.468 --> 06:26:02.478 align:start position:0%
representative cohen you're you're aware
 
06:26:04.788 --> 06:26:04.798 align:start position:0%
of that okay
 
06:26:06.310 --> 06:26:06.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:26:10.708 --> 06:26:10.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:19.670 --> 06:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:26.868 --> 06:26:26.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:29.190 --> 06:26:29.200 align:start position:0%
uh ted dears will be distributing the
 
06:26:31.510 --> 06:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
the letters to everyone
 
06:26:34.628 --> 06:26:34.638 align:start position:0%
uh for the record my name is tracy wood
 
06:26:38.230 --> 06:26:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:40.150 --> 06:26:40.160 align:start position:0%
i am the administrator of the wastewater
 
06:26:44.390 --> 06:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:46.948 --> 06:26:46.958 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to comment
 
06:26:50.390 --> 06:26:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:53.430 --> 06:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
so our main point is is that this bill
 
06:26:55.430 --> 06:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
is duplicative
 
06:26:58.708 --> 06:26:58.718 align:start position:0%
of legislation that already exists
 
06:27:02.230 --> 06:27:02.240 align:start position:0%
so we have rsa 149 i
 
06:27:06.230 --> 06:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
which is sewers and 149 i6 which
 
06:27:09.030 --> 06:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
specifically talks to bylaws and
 
06:27:09.040 --> 06:27:10.468 align:start position:0%
specifically talks to bylaws and
ordinances

06:27:10.468 --> 06:27:10.478 align:start position:0%
ordinances
 
06:27:12.070 --> 06:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
and this statue
 
06:27:13.990 --> 06:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
already gives municipalities the
 
06:27:16.390 --> 06:27:16.400 align:start position:0%
authority to adopt
 
06:27:19.030 --> 06:27:19.040 align:start position:0%
ordinances and bylaws related to their
 
06:27:21.510 --> 06:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment facility
 
06:27:24.310 --> 06:27:24.320 align:start position:0%
that's required for proper operation and
 
06:27:25.830 --> 06:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
maintenance and to promote the
 
06:27:28.548 --> 06:27:28.558 align:start position:0%
objectives of the sewage system
 
06:27:31.110 --> 06:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
this rsa is broad and it gives
 
06:27:31.120 --> 06:27:33.110 align:start position:0%
this rsa is broad and it gives
municipalities

06:27:33.110 --> 06:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
06:27:35.190 --> 06:27:35.200 align:start position:0%
the authority to adopt any ordinance
 
06:27:37.990 --> 06:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
that they deem necessary so in new
 
06:27:39.510 --> 06:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire all of our wastewater
 
06:27:41.430 --> 06:27:41.440 align:start position:0%
treatment facilities do have sewer use
 
06:27:41.440 --> 06:27:42.948 align:start position:0%
treatment facilities do have sewer use
ordinances

06:27:42.948 --> 06:27:42.958 align:start position:0%
ordinances
 
06:27:45.670 --> 06:27:45.680 align:start position:0%
we do get receive those and we do look
 
06:27:47.190 --> 06:27:47.200 align:start position:0%
at them and
 
06:27:49.190 --> 06:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
give comment and feedback
 
06:27:52.150 --> 06:27:52.160 align:start position:0%
so this is their mechanism to regulate
 
06:27:54.628 --> 06:27:54.638 align:start position:0%
anything that comes into their system
 
06:27:56.070 --> 06:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
this statute
 
06:27:57.910 --> 06:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
is already in existence so that's our
 
06:27:59.670 --> 06:27:59.680 align:start position:0%
main point there's already a statute in
 
06:28:01.910 --> 06:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
existence that gives municipalities the
 
06:28:05.030 --> 06:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
authority to do this
 
06:28:07.190 --> 06:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
i'd just like to update everyone
 
06:28:08.948 --> 06:28:08.958 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure how familiar you are with
 
06:28:10.708 --> 06:28:10.718 align:start position:0%
nipty's permitting and you may have
 
06:28:13.590 --> 06:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
heard we're not a delegated state and so
 
06:28:15.510 --> 06:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
epa region one is the permitting
 
06:28:18.868 --> 06:28:18.878 align:start position:0%
authority so epa given the fact that we
 
06:28:21.270 --> 06:28:21.280 align:start position:0%
now have the the four mcls in new
 
06:28:24.070 --> 06:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire they're starting to include
 
06:28:25.910 --> 06:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
those compounds in their nifty's
 
06:28:29.190 --> 06:28:29.200 align:start position:0%
permitting process and requiring
 
06:28:31.270 --> 06:28:31.280 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment facilities to
 
06:28:34.230 --> 06:28:34.240 align:start position:0%
sample their influent effluent
 
06:28:35.990 --> 06:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
and their sludge
 
06:28:38.230 --> 06:28:38.240 align:start position:0%
the influent in effluent is required to
 
06:28:40.788 --> 06:28:40.798 align:start position:0%
be sampled four times per year once per
 
06:28:43.110 --> 06:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
quarter and then the sludge is dependent
 
06:28:44.628 --> 06:28:44.638 align:start position:0%
on how they
 
06:28:47.110 --> 06:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
get rid of their sludge so if it's it's
 
06:28:48.868 --> 06:28:48.878 align:start position:0%
based on the volume
 
06:28:51.030 --> 06:28:51.040 align:start position:0%
so some wastewater treatment facilities
 
06:28:54.310 --> 06:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
like our legume facilities that don't uh
 
06:28:55.990 --> 06:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
get rid of their sludge very often they
 
06:28:58.788 --> 06:28:58.798 align:start position:0%
don't have to report as much and also
 
06:29:01.190 --> 06:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
included in that is the requirement for
 
06:29:03.270 --> 06:29:03.280 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment facilities to
 
06:29:07.110 --> 06:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
require industrial facilities to
 
06:29:10.230 --> 06:29:10.240 align:start position:0%
monitor for pfas and that's a once per
 
06:29:12.390 --> 06:29:12.400 align:start position:0%
year and in the letter you can see all
 
06:29:14.868 --> 06:29:14.878 align:start position:0%
the different categories that they
 
06:29:14.878 --> 06:29:17.510 align:start position:0%
the different categories that they
require

06:29:17.510 --> 06:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:19.030 --> 06:29:19.040 align:start position:0%
so that's just kind of some background
 
06:29:23.990 --> 06:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:26.230 --> 06:29:26.240 align:start position:0%
in the letter we talk about septage
 
06:29:26.240 --> 06:29:28.788 align:start position:0%
in the letter we talk about septage
concerns

06:29:28.788 --> 06:29:28.798 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
06:29:31.350 --> 06:29:31.360 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire just for numbers last
 
06:29:34.628 --> 06:29:34.638 align:start position:0%
year we we had 110 million gallons of
 
06:29:36.310 --> 06:29:36.320 align:start position:0%
septage go to our wastewater treatment
 
06:29:36.320 --> 06:29:38.708 align:start position:0%
septage go to our wastewater treatment
facilities

06:29:38.708 --> 06:29:38.718 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
06:29:41.350 --> 06:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
the logistics of including septage
 
06:29:43.750 --> 06:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
haulers in this legislation
 
06:29:45.510 --> 06:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
is you know most up to dollars they're
 
06:29:47.910 --> 06:29:47.920 align:start position:0%
mom and pops you know and they they have
 
06:29:50.230 --> 06:29:50.240 align:start position:0%
the you know one or two trucks they go
 
06:29:53.270 --> 06:29:53.280 align:start position:0%
they have 3 000 gallon tanks they may do
 
06:29:55.590 --> 06:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
you know a couple of residential homes
 
06:29:57.750 --> 06:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
in at one time then they're gonna go to
 
06:29:59.110 --> 06:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
the wastewater treatment facility and
 
06:30:01.510 --> 06:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
discharge their load if they have to
 
06:30:04.310 --> 06:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
hold that while they sample or have to
 
06:30:06.788 --> 06:30:06.798 align:start position:0%
do some interim have a holding tank like
 
06:30:09.510 --> 06:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
how would they manage that so i
 
06:30:11.350 --> 06:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
convey that to all of you to think about
 
06:30:13.110 --> 06:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
like how would that happen for them how
 
06:30:15.270 --> 06:30:15.280 align:start position:0%
would they manage that septage and
 
06:30:18.948 --> 06:30:18.958 align:start position:0%
having to test and the timing of that
 
06:30:21.190 --> 06:30:21.200 align:start position:0%
so you know consider that in this piece
 
06:30:25.830 --> 06:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:28.788 --> 06:30:28.798 align:start position:0%
just for numbers we have about 71
 
06:30:31.190 --> 06:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
nifties permits in the state
 
06:30:33.830 --> 06:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
of those epa has already required the
 
06:30:37.830 --> 06:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:37.840 --> 06:30:39.030 align:start position:0%
 
30

06:30:39.030 --> 06:30:39.040 align:start position:0%
30
 
06:30:41.110 --> 06:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
three of them soon to be 35 so we're
 
06:30:43.670 --> 06:30:43.680 align:start position:0%
already at half of the facilities so
 
06:30:45.190 --> 06:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
nifty's permits are issued on a
 
06:30:47.670 --> 06:30:47.680 align:start position:0%
five-year cycle so
 
06:30:49.270 --> 06:30:49.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of permits already have that in
 
06:30:51.030 --> 06:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
there um the other thing about the
 
06:30:53.750 --> 06:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
septic piece is
 
06:30:56.468 --> 06:30:56.478 align:start position:0%
you know will homeowners if there is an
 
06:30:58.548 --> 06:30:58.558 align:start position:0%
issue with that will homeowners delay
 
06:31:00.150 --> 06:31:00.160 align:start position:0%
pumping their tanks will this
 
06:31:03.270 --> 06:31:03.280 align:start position:0%
legislation you know will they say oh
 
06:31:04.708 --> 06:31:04.718 align:start position:0%
i'm going to hold off because i'm not
 
06:31:05.830 --> 06:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
sure what's going to happen with the
 
06:31:05.840 --> 06:31:06.948 align:start position:0%
sure what's going to happen with the
pfas

06:31:06.948 --> 06:31:06.958 align:start position:0%
pfas
 
06:31:08.868 --> 06:31:08.878 align:start position:0%
people are very concerned about pfas
 
06:31:10.310 --> 06:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
right so
 
06:31:12.788 --> 06:31:12.798 align:start position:0%
am i going to not pump my tank
 
06:31:13.990 --> 06:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
because i'm not sure what's going to
 
06:31:14.000 --> 06:31:15.590 align:start position:0%
because i'm not sure what's going to
happen

06:31:15.590 --> 06:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
happen
 
06:31:17.350 --> 06:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
with the result and are they going to
 
06:31:19.110 --> 06:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
accept my septage or not right what's
 
06:31:21.190 --> 06:31:21.200 align:start position:0%
that acceptable level
 
06:31:23.270 --> 06:31:23.280 align:start position:0%
um so if they have if they pump what are
 
06:31:24.628 --> 06:31:24.638 align:start position:0%
they going to do with that if they don't
 
06:31:27.110 --> 06:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
pump you know what's the results of that
 
06:31:29.590 --> 06:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
they could have failed
 
06:31:29.600 --> 06:31:30.948 align:start position:0%
they could have failed
failed

06:31:30.948 --> 06:31:30.958 align:start position:0%
failed
 
06:31:33.750 --> 06:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
system sorry my mouth is so dry failed
 
06:31:33.760 --> 06:31:35.750 align:start position:0%
system sorry my mouth is so dry failed
systems

06:31:35.750 --> 06:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
systems
 
06:31:38.150 --> 06:31:38.160 align:start position:0%
and um you know so and how would that if
 
06:31:39.750 --> 06:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
they failed systems that impacts our
 
06:31:43.510 --> 06:31:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:49.110 --> 06:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:51.030 --> 06:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
i think i think that really sums it up i
 
06:31:52.948 --> 06:31:52.958 align:start position:0%
mean our main concern is really that the
 
06:31:54.708 --> 06:31:54.718 align:start position:0%
the legislation already exists it's
 
06:31:56.390 --> 06:31:56.400 align:start position:0%
already in place why do we need
 
06:31:59.750 --> 06:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
duplicate of duplicative legislation
 
06:32:01.190 --> 06:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
we already have it they already have
 
06:32:02.628 --> 06:32:02.638 align:start position:0%
their sewer use ordinances they can
 
06:32:04.868 --> 06:32:04.878 align:start position:0%
amend those at any time to include any
 
06:32:06.548 --> 06:32:06.558 align:start position:0%
chemicals they want
 
06:32:09.270 --> 06:32:09.280 align:start position:0%
the legislation in bra is broad and they
 
06:32:13.270 --> 06:32:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:15.910 --> 06:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
so that ends my testimony if anyone has
 
06:32:21.110 --> 06:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:23.670 --> 06:32:23.680 align:start position:0%
representative harp
 
06:32:25.350 --> 06:32:25.360 align:start position:0%
for a question thank you for taking my
 
06:32:26.868 --> 06:32:26.878 align:start position:0%
question just a
 
06:32:28.628 --> 06:32:28.638 align:start position:0%
technical question for the record could
 
06:32:31.510 --> 06:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
you tell us what nifty stands for
 
06:32:34.390 --> 06:32:34.400 align:start position:0%
yeah sorry national pollutant discharge
 
06:32:37.030 --> 06:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
elimination system
 
06:32:40.070 --> 06:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
it's the the permitting system that
 
06:32:40.080 --> 06:32:42.310 align:start position:0%
it's the the permitting system that
that

06:32:42.310 --> 06:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:32:45.030 --> 06:32:45.040 align:start position:0%
permits point source discharges to
 
06:32:46.628 --> 06:32:46.638 align:start position:0%
surface waters
 
06:32:48.708 --> 06:32:48.718 align:start position:0%
so any wastewater treatment facility
 
06:32:50.390 --> 06:32:50.400 align:start position:0%
that has a point source or pipe
 
06:32:52.628 --> 06:32:52.638 align:start position:0%
discharge to a surface water is
 
06:32:54.548 --> 06:32:54.558 align:start position:0%
regulated through nipties
 
06:32:59.510 --> 06:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:02.788 --> 06:33:02.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:05.590 --> 06:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
your statement is that or at least would
 
06:33:07.750 --> 06:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
your your testimony is that
 
06:33:10.948 --> 06:33:10.958 align:start position:0%
the law already exists to be able to do
 
06:33:13.590 --> 06:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
what the bill wants have you had
 
06:33:17.590 --> 06:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
discussions with the uh bill uh
 
06:33:20.468 --> 06:33:20.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:23.270 --> 06:33:23.280 align:start position:0%
sponsors no we have not at this time but
 
06:33:24.628 --> 06:33:24.638 align:start position:0%
we would like to
 
06:33:24.638 --> 06:33:25.590 align:start position:0%
we would like to
okay

06:33:25.590 --> 06:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:33:30.150 --> 06:33:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:32.310 --> 06:33:32.320 align:start position:0%
representative smith thank you mr chair
 
06:33:34.070 --> 06:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
and thank you um
 
06:33:36.070 --> 06:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
you stated that
 
06:33:36.080 --> 06:33:37.270 align:start position:0%
you stated that
um

06:33:37.270 --> 06:33:37.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:33:39.510 --> 06:33:39.520 align:start position:0%
annual sampling of certain industrial
 
06:33:39.520 --> 06:33:41.190 align:start position:0%
annual sampling of certain industrial
discharges

06:33:41.190 --> 06:33:41.200 align:start position:0%
discharges
 
06:33:43.830 --> 06:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
happens annually
 
06:33:46.548 --> 06:33:46.558 align:start position:0%
now is that something that des des goes
 
06:33:48.548 --> 06:33:48.558 align:start position:0%
out and tests like the car washes
 
06:33:49.990 --> 06:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
because i've been very concerned about
 
06:33:52.868 --> 06:33:52.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:54.788 --> 06:33:54.798 align:start position:0%
what's in the nipty's permits this will
 
06:33:56.708 --> 06:33:56.718 align:start position:0%
actually require the wastewater
 
06:33:59.510 --> 06:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
treatment facility to sample them
 
06:33:59.520 --> 06:34:00.548 align:start position:0%
treatment facility to sample them
however

06:34:00.548 --> 06:34:00.558 align:start position:0%
however
 
06:34:02.628 --> 06:34:02.638 align:start position:0%
they can also through their sewer use
 
06:34:05.590 --> 06:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
ordinance require the industry to sample
 
06:34:07.910 --> 06:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
and provide the samples to them the
 
06:34:10.230 --> 06:34:10.240 align:start position:0%
sewer use ordinance is a very powerful
 
06:34:10.240 --> 06:34:11.510 align:start position:0%
sewer use ordinance is a very powerful
mechanism

06:34:11.510 --> 06:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
mechanism
 
06:34:14.230 --> 06:34:14.240 align:start position:0%
and it gives like i said the community
 
06:34:16.468 --> 06:34:16.478 align:start position:0%
the broad authority to adopt anything
 
06:34:18.230 --> 06:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
that they need they they feel they need
 
06:34:20.868 --> 06:34:20.878 align:start position:0%
to to protect their infrastructure we
 
06:34:23.430 --> 06:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
know wastewater infrastructure is very
 
06:34:25.590 --> 06:34:25.600 align:start position:0%
expensive if you look what portsmouth
 
06:34:27.750 --> 06:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
just spent on their wastewater treatment
 
06:34:30.310 --> 06:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
facility over 93 million dollars you
 
06:34:32.390 --> 06:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
talk about the collection system
 
06:34:34.070 --> 06:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
you know people are protecting their
 
06:34:40.070 --> 06:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:42.708 --> 06:34:42.718 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
06:34:48.310 --> 06:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:50.390 --> 06:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
chair calls
 
06:34:54.948 --> 06:34:54.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:56.468 --> 06:34:56.478 align:start position:0%
from the new hampshire municipal
 
06:34:56.478 --> 06:34:57.750 align:start position:0%
from the new hampshire municipal
association

06:34:57.750 --> 06:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
association
 
06:35:00.070 --> 06:35:00.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair nate grace from the
 
06:35:02.310 --> 06:35:02.320 align:start position:0%
new hampshire municipal association
 
06:35:05.350 --> 06:35:05.360 align:start position:0%
i actually get to support a pfas bill um
 
06:35:09.110 --> 06:35:09.120 align:start position:0%
so i'm here to support uh hb1185
 
06:35:12.070 --> 06:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
uh the way we read this bill is that it
 
06:35:13.590 --> 06:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
clarifies the authority that
 
06:35:15.590 --> 06:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities have
 
06:35:18.468 --> 06:35:18.478 align:start position:0%
so i don't disagree with des they
 
06:35:20.468 --> 06:35:20.478 align:start position:0%
already have this authority
 
06:35:23.350 --> 06:35:23.360 align:start position:0%
um through their sewer use ordinance
 
06:35:25.510 --> 06:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
but the way that we read it is it just
 
06:35:27.750 --> 06:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
more clearly states they have this
 
06:35:29.670 --> 06:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
authority with regard to pfas in
 
06:35:31.830 --> 06:35:31.840 align:start position:0%
particular as you heard representative
 
06:35:33.190 --> 06:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
rung state
 
06:35:35.190 --> 06:35:35.200 align:start position:0%
that has been in contention
 
06:35:37.750 --> 06:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
in the municipality that she represents
 
06:35:38.788 --> 06:35:38.798 align:start position:0%
and there has been quite a lot of
 
06:35:40.708 --> 06:35:40.718 align:start position:0%
litigation about whether or not the
 
06:35:43.030 --> 06:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
municipality has this authority
 
06:35:44.628 --> 06:35:44.638 align:start position:0%
and we think it's very important to
 
06:35:46.628 --> 06:35:46.638 align:start position:0%
clearly spell this out
 
06:35:48.868 --> 06:35:48.878 align:start position:0%
just to make sure that there is no
 
06:35:51.270 --> 06:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
question and and that question is not
 
06:35:53.990 --> 06:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
being decided by someone in a black robe
 
06:35:56.868 --> 06:35:56.878 align:start position:0%
but it's all of you
 
06:35:58.868 --> 06:35:58.878 align:start position:0%
and so that
 
06:36:00.150 --> 06:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
everyone is very clear that the
 
06:36:03.590 --> 06:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities do have this authority
 
06:36:06.230 --> 06:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
as far as the
 
06:36:06.240 --> 06:36:07.670 align:start position:0%
as far as the
uh

06:36:07.670 --> 06:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:36:09.910 --> 06:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
real purpose of this bill
 
06:36:11.430 --> 06:36:11.440 align:start position:0%
one of the things that this bill is
 
06:36:13.350 --> 06:36:13.360 align:start position:0%
going to do is allow waste water
 
06:36:15.190 --> 06:36:15.200 align:start position:0%
treatment facilities
 
06:36:15.200 --> 06:36:16.230 align:start position:0%
treatment facilities
to

06:36:16.230 --> 06:36:16.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:36:17.910 --> 06:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
better identify
 
06:36:21.750 --> 06:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
sources of pfas contamination so
 
06:36:23.430 --> 06:36:23.440 align:start position:0%
one of the major concerns that we've
 
06:36:26.230 --> 06:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
heard from our municipalities who have
 
06:36:28.708 --> 06:36:28.718 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment facilities
 
06:36:30.628 --> 06:36:30.638 align:start position:0%
is that they will receive
 
06:36:30.638 --> 06:36:32.070 align:start position:0%
is that they will receive
um

06:36:32.070 --> 06:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:36:34.788 --> 06:36:34.798 align:start position:0%
wastewater in all forms
 
06:36:37.270 --> 06:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
through their sewer system
 
06:36:37.280 --> 06:36:38.310 align:start position:0%
through their sewer system
and

06:36:38.310 --> 06:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:36:40.070 --> 06:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
they'll and they'll have their end
 
06:36:42.150 --> 06:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
products which are the the liquid that's
 
06:36:43.830 --> 06:36:43.840 align:start position:0%
discharged the river for instance and
 
06:36:46.788 --> 06:36:46.798 align:start position:0%
then the the compost that is sold
 
06:36:48.868 --> 06:36:48.878 align:start position:0%
for fertilizer
 
06:36:50.548 --> 06:36:50.558 align:start position:0%
and that will be tested as sort of a
 
06:36:52.150 --> 06:36:52.160 align:start position:0%
routine process and they'll find out
 
06:36:54.468 --> 06:36:54.478 align:start position:0%
there's pfas in it and they don't have
 
06:36:56.548 --> 06:36:56.558 align:start position:0%
any sort of testing that they're doing
 
06:36:56.558 --> 06:36:58.230 align:start position:0%
any sort of testing that they're doing
upstream

06:36:58.230 --> 06:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
upstream
 
06:37:00.150 --> 06:37:00.160 align:start position:0%
to figure out where that's coming from
 
06:37:01.990 --> 06:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
and so they
 
06:37:04.230 --> 06:37:04.240 align:start position:0%
what this would do is just clarify they
 
06:37:06.548 --> 06:37:06.558 align:start position:0%
have that they have this authority to go
 
06:37:07.830 --> 06:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
out and say
 
06:37:07.840 --> 06:37:08.628 align:start position:0%
out and say
hey

06:37:08.628 --> 06:37:08.638 align:start position:0%
hey
 
06:37:09.670 --> 06:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
you know
 
06:37:11.990 --> 06:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
we think you might be introducing pfast
 
06:37:14.468 --> 06:37:14.478 align:start position:0%
the system we want you to test test what
 
06:37:16.868 --> 06:37:16.878 align:start position:0%
you're putting into the system
 
06:37:16.878 --> 06:37:17.830 align:start position:0%
you're putting into the system
um

06:37:17.830 --> 06:37:17.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:37:20.548 --> 06:37:20.558 align:start position:0%
and in speaking with a
 
06:37:22.628 --> 06:37:22.638 align:start position:0%
number of people in the hallway here
 
06:37:24.628 --> 06:37:24.638 align:start position:0%
really the intent is just to have sort
 
06:37:26.230 --> 06:37:26.240 align:start position:0%
of a random sampling to have a better
 
06:37:27.750 --> 06:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
idea of where this is coming from we
 
06:37:29.190 --> 06:37:29.200 align:start position:0%
know things like
 
06:37:31.750 --> 06:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
car washes are sources because
 
06:37:33.510 --> 06:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
somebody at some point time said hey we
 
06:37:35.350 --> 06:37:35.360 align:start position:0%
think this is a source we did a sample
 
06:37:37.750 --> 06:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
and sure enough pfas came up but of
 
06:37:39.030 --> 06:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
course there are
 
06:37:40.468 --> 06:37:40.478 align:start position:0%
thousands of
 
06:37:42.548 --> 06:37:42.558 align:start position:0%
of different uh
 
06:37:44.468 --> 06:37:44.478 align:start position:0%
connections to the wastewater system
 
06:37:44.478 --> 06:37:45.750 align:start position:0%
connections to the wastewater system
with

06:37:45.750 --> 06:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
with
 
06:37:47.510 --> 06:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of different uh
 
06:37:47.520 --> 06:37:48.788 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of different uh
uses

06:37:48.788 --> 06:37:48.798 align:start position:0%
uses
 
06:37:50.390 --> 06:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
and we haven't narrowed down where the
 
06:37:52.390 --> 06:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
pfas is coming from in all instances and
 
06:37:53.430 --> 06:37:53.440 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
06:37:55.110 --> 06:37:55.120 align:start position:0%
one of the intents here is try to figure
 
06:37:56.788 --> 06:37:56.798 align:start position:0%
out where it's coming from
 
06:37:59.190 --> 06:37:59.200 align:start position:0%
so we can hold the responsible parties
 
06:38:00.948 --> 06:38:00.958 align:start position:0%
responsible or at least identify who
 
06:38:02.628 --> 06:38:02.638 align:start position:0%
they are
 
06:38:08.390 --> 06:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:09.510 --> 06:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
06:38:11.590 --> 06:38:11.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh thank you for
 
06:38:14.628 --> 06:38:14.638 align:start position:0%
uh testifying uh just a quick question
 
06:38:14.638 --> 06:38:15.590 align:start position:0%
uh testifying uh just a quick question
um

06:38:15.590 --> 06:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:38:18.948 --> 06:38:18.958 align:start position:0%
i'm getting the the gist that
 
06:38:20.708 --> 06:38:20.718 align:start position:0%
from your testimony
 
06:38:22.708 --> 06:38:22.718 align:start position:0%
that this is to
 
06:38:24.628 --> 06:38:24.638 align:start position:0%
you agree that the municipalities
 
06:38:26.948 --> 06:38:26.958 align:start position:0%
already have the the ability to this
 
06:38:29.510 --> 06:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
would just kind of sort of shore that up
 
06:38:31.990 --> 06:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
right i'm also getting the sense that
 
06:38:33.990 --> 06:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
it's to shore up because of whatever
 
06:38:35.670 --> 06:38:35.680 align:start position:0%
infractions have already happened and
 
06:38:37.830 --> 06:38:37.840 align:start position:0%
that you want to be able to to possibly
 
06:38:39.990 --> 06:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
do something about that my question is
 
06:38:42.390 --> 06:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
is wouldn't that basically be a retro uh
 
06:38:44.868 --> 06:38:44.878 align:start position:0%
act of law uh and go against our
 
06:38:48.548 --> 06:38:48.558 align:start position:0%
constitutional article 23 about
 
06:38:51.270 --> 06:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
no because we're not going back to test
 
06:38:53.830 --> 06:38:53.840 align:start position:0%
old samples we're talking about
 
06:38:53.840 --> 06:38:55.750 align:start position:0%
old samples we're talking about
um

06:38:55.750 --> 06:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:38:58.468 --> 06:38:58.478 align:start position:0%
about you know current discharges so
 
06:39:00.788 --> 06:39:00.798 align:start position:0%
this law goes into effect tomorrow
 
06:39:03.270 --> 06:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
you know company x puts pfas into the
 
06:39:05.670 --> 06:39:05.680 align:start position:0%
wastewater system they say hey
 
06:39:06.948 --> 06:39:06.958 align:start position:0%
uh you know we have evidence you're
 
06:39:08.948 --> 06:39:08.958 align:start position:0%
putting pfast in the system
 
06:39:11.590 --> 06:39:11.600 align:start position:0%
we want you to test uh company x test
 
06:39:12.948 --> 06:39:12.958 align:start position:0%
sure enough they're putting b fast in
 
06:39:14.390 --> 06:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
the system that's not going back in time
 
06:39:16.070 --> 06:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
we're looking forward okay thank you
 
06:39:18.628 --> 06:39:18.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:22.628 --> 06:39:22.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:24.310 --> 06:39:24.320 align:start position:0%
seeing no hands
 
06:39:28.070 --> 06:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:28.080 --> 06:39:29.350 align:start position:0%
 
uh

06:39:29.350 --> 06:39:29.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:39:31.270 --> 06:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
larry masnick
 
06:39:39.830 --> 06:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:42.628 --> 06:39:42.638 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is larry masnick
 
06:39:44.548 --> 06:39:44.558 align:start position:0%
co-owner of madison accepted service
 
06:39:46.708 --> 06:39:46.718 align:start position:0%
with my wife we are
 
06:39:48.868 --> 06:39:48.878 align:start position:0%
mom-and-pop service
 
06:39:50.310 --> 06:39:50.320 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for letting me speak
 
06:39:52.628 --> 06:39:52.638 align:start position:0%
representative ron zulu
 
06:39:52.638 --> 06:39:53.670 align:start position:0%
representative ron zulu
um

06:39:53.670 --> 06:39:53.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:39:56.830 --> 06:39:56.840 align:start position:0%
actually i did make up a
 
06:40:10.310 --> 06:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:12.788 --> 06:40:12.798 align:start position:0%
you just have one copy
 
06:40:14.070 --> 06:40:14.080 align:start position:0%
two okay
 
06:40:16.468 --> 06:40:16.478 align:start position:0%
it just goes basically i'm supposed to
 
06:40:16.478 --> 06:40:17.430 align:start position:0%
it just goes basically i'm supposed to
declare

06:40:17.430 --> 06:40:17.440 align:start position:0%
declare
 
06:40:19.830 --> 06:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
okay i'll read this off that's part of
 
06:40:19.840 --> 06:40:21.350 align:start position:0%
okay i'll read this off that's part of
my

06:40:21.350 --> 06:40:21.360 align:start position:0%
my
 
06:40:23.830 --> 06:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
so in lieu of house bill
 
06:40:26.868 --> 06:40:26.878 align:start position:0%
1185 would enable wastewater treatment
 
06:40:29.190 --> 06:40:29.200 align:start position:0%
plants to require any industrial or
 
06:40:31.910 --> 06:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
commercial facility or septic collar
 
06:40:33.830 --> 06:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
contributing discharge to determine the
 
06:40:38.548 --> 06:40:38.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:40.708 --> 06:40:40.718 align:start position:0%
in the third level it says a wastewater
 
06:40:42.708 --> 06:40:42.718 align:start position:0%
treatment plant may refuse discharge
 
06:40:44.310 --> 06:40:44.320 align:start position:0%
from an industrial or commercial
 
06:40:47.270 --> 06:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
facility or septic hauler that has
 
06:40:49.190 --> 06:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
reported a level of pfas and its
 
06:40:51.830 --> 06:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
discharge above the level the wastewater
 
06:40:53.110 --> 06:40:53.120 align:start position:0%
treatment plant
 
06:40:56.788 --> 06:40:56.798 align:start position:0%
determines to be acceptable
 
06:40:59.110 --> 06:40:59.120 align:start position:0%
at present time it is taking two weeks
 
06:41:01.910 --> 06:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
to get the test back from the labs with
 
06:41:04.150 --> 06:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
these pfas
 
06:41:06.150 --> 06:41:06.160 align:start position:0%
with each test costs
 
06:41:08.070 --> 06:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
over two hundred dollars a hauler would
 
06:41:10.310 --> 06:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
have to pre-test every tank
 
06:41:13.030 --> 06:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
they pump two weeks in advance so as not
 
06:41:15.670 --> 06:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
to get stuck with a hot load
 
06:41:17.830 --> 06:41:17.840 align:start position:0%
like representative post said what do we
 
06:41:19.350 --> 06:41:19.360 align:start position:0%
do with it
 
06:41:21.590 --> 06:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
if the wastewater treatment plant won't
 
06:41:24.230 --> 06:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
take it what do i do with it
 
06:41:30.150 --> 06:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:32.548 --> 06:41:32.558 align:start position:0%
with the price of the test plus the
 
06:41:35.910 --> 06:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
labor charge of performing the pre-test
 
06:41:38.628 --> 06:41:38.638 align:start position:0%
we would be doubling the cost of pumping
 
06:41:41.270 --> 06:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
pumping for each individual tank
 
06:41:43.270 --> 06:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
people are already choking on our
 
06:41:45.510 --> 06:41:45.520 align:start position:0%
thousand we're a thousand gallon tank
 
06:41:48.150 --> 06:41:48.160 align:start position:0%
we're 290 dollars
 
06:41:52.150 --> 06:41:52.160 align:start position:0%
we'd be up around upwards around 500
 
06:41:54.310 --> 06:41:54.320 align:start position:0%
a septic tank
 
06:41:57.190 --> 06:41:57.200 align:start position:0%
in a septic system just to be short
 
06:41:58.468 --> 06:41:58.478 align:start position:0%
all it is
 
06:42:02.070 --> 06:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
is a strainer it's to strain the solids
 
06:42:04.628 --> 06:42:04.638 align:start position:0%
out of the gray water so just the gray
 
06:42:07.190 --> 06:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
water mainly is going to the septic
 
06:42:07.200 --> 06:42:08.628 align:start position:0%
water mainly is going to the septic
field

06:42:08.628 --> 06:42:08.638 align:start position:0%
field
 
06:42:09.750 --> 06:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
if these
 
06:42:11.270 --> 06:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
like any
 
06:42:11.280 --> 06:42:13.430 align:start position:0%
like any
filter

06:42:13.430 --> 06:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
filter
 
06:42:15.430 --> 06:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
if these the more these things get
 
06:42:17.670 --> 06:42:17.680 align:start position:0%
filled up the more contaminants are
 
06:42:19.350 --> 06:42:19.360 align:start position:0%
going to get by it
 
06:42:21.350 --> 06:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
and these these solids get out into the
 
06:42:23.270 --> 06:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
field and that's the main reason septic
 
06:42:24.948 --> 06:42:24.958 align:start position:0%
fields fail
 
06:42:26.708 --> 06:42:26.718 align:start position:0%
because these solids get into the
 
06:42:28.708 --> 06:42:28.718 align:start position:0%
fissures in the soil they plug them up
 
06:42:30.708 --> 06:42:30.718 align:start position:0%
the water can't percolate down to these
 
06:42:32.390 --> 06:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
fissures in the soil
 
06:42:34.390 --> 06:42:34.400 align:start position:0%
water can't go down it comes up onto the
 
06:42:36.548 --> 06:42:36.558 align:start position:0%
surface and you have a failed system
 
06:42:38.390 --> 06:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
these tanks need to be cleaned
 
06:42:41.750 --> 06:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
periodically to get back the
 
06:42:44.548 --> 06:42:44.558 align:start position:0%
maximum volume in these tanks to collect
 
06:42:49.270 --> 06:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:50.948 --> 06:42:50.958 align:start position:0%
what would we do if there is an
 
06:42:53.830 --> 06:42:53.840 align:start position:0%
emergency call in a municipality pump
 
06:42:55.910 --> 06:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
station when the sewage is pouring out
 
06:42:58.150 --> 06:42:58.160 align:start position:0%
onto the street
 
06:42:59.910 --> 06:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
take a sample and tell them we'll have
 
06:43:01.670 --> 06:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
to wait for the test results to come
 
06:43:05.750 --> 06:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:08.468 --> 06:43:08.478 align:start position:0%
i don't think so
 
06:43:11.350 --> 06:43:11.360 align:start position:0%
and i do we haul also commercial
 
06:43:14.548 --> 06:43:14.558 align:start position:0%
municipalities and residential
 
06:43:16.628 --> 06:43:16.638 align:start position:0%
uh yes i do
 
06:43:19.350 --> 06:43:19.360 align:start position:0%
we take two tanks we're going out to
 
06:43:21.990 --> 06:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
amherst i'll take two tanks out there if
 
06:43:23.590 --> 06:43:23.600 align:start position:0%
i have a uh
 
06:43:25.430 --> 06:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
another commercial site i'll take that
 
06:43:27.510 --> 06:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
tank and then we'll go dump it and then
 
06:43:29.830 --> 06:43:29.840 align:start position:0%
we go maybe another direction i have two
 
06:43:31.430 --> 06:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
trucks that i have running
 
06:43:32.948 --> 06:43:32.958 align:start position:0%
right now one and during the winter is
 
06:43:35.350 --> 06:43:35.360 align:start position:0%
our slow time
 
06:43:38.390 --> 06:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
but like i said representative post says
 
06:43:41.270 --> 06:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
what do we do with these hut loads where
 
06:43:43.190 --> 06:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
do we bring them
 
06:43:45.990 --> 06:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
that is that is my uh rebuttal to this
 
06:43:51.190 --> 06:43:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:54.230 --> 06:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
in this bill before you pass it
 
06:43:58.310 --> 06:43:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:00.390 --> 06:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
question for the witness representative
 
06:44:00.400 --> 06:44:01.910 align:start position:0%
question for the witness representative
post

06:44:01.910 --> 06:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
post
 
06:44:03.750 --> 06:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
again thank you for taking my question
 
06:44:05.510 --> 06:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
mr chair and thank you for testifying
 
06:44:08.788 --> 06:44:08.798 align:start position:0%
today could you please send us um to our
 
06:44:12.628 --> 06:44:12.638 align:start position:0%
emails your your your testimony today
 
06:44:14.150 --> 06:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
sure yes
 
06:44:17.590 --> 06:44:17.600 align:start position:0%
um where would i get the emails um so
 
06:44:17.600 --> 06:44:19.430 align:start position:0%
um where would i get the emails um so
um

06:44:19.430 --> 06:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:44:21.750 --> 06:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
generally just to the legislative email
 
06:44:21.760 --> 06:44:22.468 align:start position:0%
generally just to the legislative email
so

06:44:22.468 --> 06:44:22.478 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:44:25.350 --> 06:44:25.360 align:start position:0%
it would be our first name last name
 
06:44:27.830 --> 06:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
no no no
 
06:44:27.840 --> 06:44:30.150 align:start position:0%
no no no
okay

06:44:30.150 --> 06:44:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:31.670 --> 06:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
send it to the uh senator to the
 
06:44:34.150 --> 06:44:34.160 align:start position:0%
committee the the committee has our
 
06:44:35.910 --> 06:44:35.920 align:start position:0%

committee
 
06:44:39.750 --> 06:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
so it's you should be able to get it off
 
06:44:41.350 --> 06:44:41.360 align:start position:0%
of the uh
 
06:44:41.360 --> 06:44:42.788 align:start position:0%
of the uh
uh

06:44:42.788 --> 06:44:42.798 align:start position:0%

mr chair
 
06:44:49.270 --> 06:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
if you go to the general court website
 
06:44:51.350 --> 06:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
understanding committees it'll give you
 
06:44:53.750 --> 06:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
our committee designation you can email
 
06:44:57.670 --> 06:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
all committee or individual members
 
06:45:04.948 --> 06:45:04.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:07.670 --> 06:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
any other questions i was on the i i
 
06:45:10.070 --> 06:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
started uh
 
06:45:10.080 --> 06:45:11.590 align:start position:0%
started uh
with

06:45:11.590 --> 06:45:11.600 align:start position:0%
with
 
06:45:14.948 --> 06:45:14.958 align:start position:0%
des back in 2019 we were on a committee
 
06:45:18.150 --> 06:45:18.160 align:start position:0%
to look into this pfas thing i'm i'm
 
06:45:20.628 --> 06:45:20.638 align:start position:0%
kind of surprised i it kind of got put
 
06:45:25.190 --> 06:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:27.030 --> 06:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
i'm surprised it just came up this quick
 
06:45:29.110 --> 06:45:29.120 align:start position:0%
and that kind of caught us off guard i
 
06:45:32.150 --> 06:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
apologize for that well
 
06:45:34.390 --> 06:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
put it this way we have a we haven't met
 
06:45:38.548 --> 06:45:38.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:40.708 --> 06:45:40.718 align:start position:0%
without any other questions thank you
 
06:45:43.430 --> 06:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you very much

uh
okay

06:45:45.320 --> 06:45:45.330 align:start position:0%
okay

thank you mr chair um and members of the
 
06:46:04.868 --> 06:46:04.878 align:start position:0%
committee i appreciate the opportunity
 
06:46:08.468 --> 06:46:08.478 align:start position:0%
to testify um i actually did email two
 
06:46:10.468 --> 06:46:10.478 align:start position:0%
letters to the committee one is from our
 
06:46:12.310 --> 06:46:12.320 align:start position:0%
town manager um actually i probably
 
06:46:14.708 --> 06:46:14.718 align:start position:0%
should say my name is sarita croche um i
 
06:46:16.230 --> 06:46:16.240 align:start position:0%
actually work in a wastewater treatment
 
06:46:18.948 --> 06:46:18.958 align:start position:0%
plant i run the merrimack wastewater
 
06:46:22.310 --> 06:46:22.320 align:start position:0%
treatment plant um we are a five mgd
 
06:46:24.310 --> 06:46:24.320 align:start position:0%
system and we have the privilege of
 
06:46:26.708 --> 06:46:26.718 align:start position:0%
having a lot of issues with pfas at this
 
06:46:29.030 --> 06:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
present time and over the past six years
 
06:46:31.270 --> 06:46:31.280 align:start position:0%
we've had a lot of issues in trying to
 
06:46:34.548 --> 06:46:34.558 align:start position:0%
deal with it and i'm here today rather
 
06:46:36.230 --> 06:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
than reading the letter i'd like to tell
 
06:46:38.150 --> 06:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
you it doesn't work
 
06:46:41.830 --> 06:46:41.840 align:start position:0%
what's there right now it doesn't work
 
06:46:44.468 --> 06:46:44.478 align:start position:0%
we have tried to get
 
06:46:46.468 --> 06:46:46.478 align:start position:0%
one of the industrial users in our
 
06:46:48.548 --> 06:46:48.558 align:start position:0%
community to
 
06:46:50.788 --> 06:46:50.798 align:start position:0%
deal with some of the pfas
 
06:46:53.510 --> 06:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
all we get is legal documents telling us
 
06:46:55.510 --> 06:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
we don't have the authority so it
 
06:46:57.350 --> 06:46:57.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't work
 
06:47:00.150 --> 06:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
we try to sample and it is very
 
06:47:02.390 --> 06:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
expensive we don't have an unlimited
 
06:47:02.400 --> 06:47:03.670 align:start position:0%
expensive we don't have an unlimited
income

06:47:03.670 --> 06:47:03.680 align:start position:0%
income
 
06:47:06.070 --> 06:47:06.080 align:start position:0%
or unlimited budget we have a set budget
 
06:47:08.390 --> 06:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
and so we also have to be cognizant of
 
06:47:10.948 --> 06:47:10.958 align:start position:0%
what we're dealing with so it doesn't
 
06:47:13.670 --> 06:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
work what i put forth in the
 
06:47:16.468 --> 06:47:16.478 align:start position:0%
letter that was from myself and the dpw
 
06:47:16.478 --> 06:47:18.070 align:start position:0%
letter that was from myself and the dpw
director

06:47:18.070 --> 06:47:18.080 align:start position:0%
director
 
06:47:22.230 --> 06:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
i mentioned that we accepted 4.5 million
 
06:47:24.230 --> 06:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
gallons of septage
 
06:47:27.270 --> 06:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
last year and the cost of that septage
 
06:47:30.230 --> 06:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
was 354 thousand dollars we also
 
06:47:30.240 --> 06:47:31.670 align:start position:0%
was 354 thousand dollars we also
accepted

06:47:31.670 --> 06:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
accepted
 
06:47:31.680 --> 06:47:32.910 align:start position:0%
accepted
5

06:47:32.910 --> 06:47:32.920 align:start position:0%
5
 
06:47:35.830 --> 06:47:35.840 align:start position:0%
660 tons of
 
06:47:35.840 --> 06:47:36.948 align:start position:0%
660 tons of
um

06:47:36.948 --> 06:47:36.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:47:36.958 --> 06:47:37.910 align:start position:0%
um
sludge

06:47:37.910 --> 06:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
sludge
 
06:47:40.070 --> 06:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
we actually accepted the sludge from
 
06:47:40.080 --> 06:47:41.190 align:start position:0%
we actually accepted the sludge from
franklin

06:47:41.190 --> 06:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
franklin
 
06:47:41.200 --> 06:47:41.990 align:start position:0%
franklin
which

06:47:41.990 --> 06:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
which
 
06:47:44.788 --> 06:47:44.798 align:start position:0%
ms wood was talking about so we take
 
06:47:49.590 --> 06:47:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:52.150 --> 06:47:52.160 align:start position:0%
that sludge what those communities paid
 
06:47:55.190 --> 06:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
last year was 393 thousand dollars
 
06:47:58.070 --> 06:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
now we also generate about 4
 
06:47:58.080 --> 06:48:00.230 align:start position:0%
now we also generate about 4
600

06:48:00.230 --> 06:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
600
 
06:48:02.150 --> 06:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
tons of sludge ourselves in the town of
 
06:48:02.160 --> 06:48:03.670 align:start position:0%
tons of sludge ourselves in the town of
merrimack

06:48:03.670 --> 06:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
merrimack
 
06:48:05.670 --> 06:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
if we were to try and dispose of that
 
06:48:08.070 --> 06:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
off site it would cost roughly somewhere
 
06:48:10.468 --> 06:48:10.478 align:start position:0%
between one and two million dollars
 
06:48:12.708 --> 06:48:12.718 align:start position:0%
for those eight communities that submit
 
06:48:12.718 --> 06:48:13.590 align:start position:0%
for those eight communities that submit
their

06:48:13.590 --> 06:48:13.600 align:start position:0%
their
 
06:48:15.190 --> 06:48:15.200 align:start position:0%
septage to us and those eight
 
06:48:17.270 --> 06:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
communities that submit give us their
 
06:48:17.280 --> 06:48:18.230 align:start position:0%
communities that submit give us their
sludge

06:48:18.230 --> 06:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
sludge
 
06:48:21.590 --> 06:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
the cost would astronomically increase
 
06:48:24.788 --> 06:48:24.798 align:start position:0%
if we can't handle the pfas issue the
 
06:48:27.350 --> 06:48:27.360 align:start position:0%
reality is is we have a compost facility
 
06:48:29.030 --> 06:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
and what we do in this compost facility
 
06:48:31.190 --> 06:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
is we take the sludge we take the
 
06:48:32.628 --> 06:48:32.638 align:start position:0%
septage we process it through our
 
06:48:34.468 --> 06:48:34.478 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plant we take the
 
06:48:36.948 --> 06:48:36.958 align:start position:0%
sludge that we generate and we de-water
 
06:48:39.590 --> 06:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
it and then after we de-water it we take
 
06:48:41.910 --> 06:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
it we mix it with a
 
06:48:44.230 --> 06:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
sawdust and we heat it to very high
 
06:48:46.390 --> 06:48:46.400 align:start position:0%
temperatures so the idea behind that is
 
06:48:48.868 --> 06:48:48.878 align:start position:0%
you do a pathogen reduction and when you
 
06:48:50.948 --> 06:48:50.958 align:start position:0%
do that pathogen reduction you kill all
 
06:48:52.548 --> 06:48:52.558 align:start position:0%
those things that could make anybody
 
06:48:54.788 --> 06:48:54.798 align:start position:0%
sick and then what we do is we market it
 
06:48:56.628 --> 06:48:56.638 align:start position:0%
and we're marketing it through a company
 
06:48:59.430 --> 06:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
called agrisource we were able to market
 
06:49:02.070 --> 06:49:02.080 align:start position:0%
last year
 
06:49:05.270 --> 06:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
fifteen thousand cubic yards of our
 
06:49:07.430 --> 06:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
compost and we were able to give away
 
06:49:10.150 --> 06:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
750 cubic yards of compost to to the
 
06:49:13.190 --> 06:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
municipality and local areas our intent
 
06:49:15.990 --> 06:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
or our belief of this is to help start
 
06:49:19.270 --> 06:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
the process of trying to figure out
 
06:49:20.868 --> 06:49:20.878 align:start position:0%
where it's all coming from because the
 
06:49:23.030 --> 06:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
reality is is when it hits the
 
06:49:25.110 --> 06:49:25.120 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plant that's the
 
06:49:28.070 --> 06:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
last place there's no place else to turn
 
06:49:30.628 --> 06:49:30.638 align:start position:0%
there is no technology out there to help
 
06:49:32.548 --> 06:49:32.558 align:start position:0%
a wastewater treatment plant treat for
 
06:49:34.868 --> 06:49:34.878 align:start position:0%
pfas it doesn't exist
 
06:49:37.910 --> 06:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
so the best approach to actually deal
 
06:49:40.948 --> 06:49:40.958 align:start position:0%
with this is to handle it at the source
 
06:49:40.958 --> 06:49:41.910 align:start position:0%
with this is to handle it at the source
level

06:49:41.910 --> 06:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
level
 
06:49:44.150 --> 06:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
those industrial users
 
06:49:46.948 --> 06:49:46.958 align:start position:0%
those commercial users interestingly
 
06:49:48.868 --> 06:49:48.878 align:start position:0%
everybody's talking about car washes
 
06:49:51.670 --> 06:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
well we had actually des sampled a car
 
06:49:53.910 --> 06:49:53.920 align:start position:0%
wash in the town of merrimack there was
 
06:49:55.990 --> 06:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
no pfas in the wastewater there it was
 
06:49:58.628 --> 06:49:58.638 align:start position:0%
non-detect so again the importance of
 
06:50:01.110 --> 06:50:01.120 align:start position:0%
this is understanding where it's from
 
06:50:02.708 --> 06:50:02.718 align:start position:0%
the intent
 
06:50:04.788 --> 06:50:04.798 align:start position:0%
from our perspective is not to sample
 
06:50:06.628 --> 06:50:06.638 align:start position:0%
every load of septage the fact of the
 
06:50:10.310 --> 06:50:10.320 align:start position:0%
matter is the community in which we run
 
06:50:11.990 --> 06:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
all of the septic that's generated in
 
06:50:14.468 --> 06:50:14.478 align:start position:0%
that community has to be accepted by the
 
06:50:16.788 --> 06:50:16.798 align:start position:0%
municipality so we don't have a choice
 
06:50:18.868 --> 06:50:18.878 align:start position:0%
so the concept that we wouldn't accept
 
06:50:20.628 --> 06:50:20.638 align:start position:0%
something from a pump station in the
 
06:50:22.468 --> 06:50:22.478 align:start position:0%
town of merrimack
 
06:50:25.030 --> 06:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
because it wasn't sampled is is not
 
06:50:27.350 --> 06:50:27.360 align:start position:0%
correct we have to accept it
 
06:50:29.750 --> 06:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
what we would like to see is the ability
 
06:50:31.830 --> 06:50:31.840 align:start position:0%
to be able to accept each haulers to do
 
06:50:33.830 --> 06:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
a representative sample so we understand
 
06:50:35.830 --> 06:50:35.840 align:start position:0%
where it's coming from and we can start
 
06:50:38.390 --> 06:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
managing the problem because the reality
 
06:50:41.430 --> 06:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
is as i point out in my letter is that
 
06:50:44.070 --> 06:50:44.080 align:start position:0%
if we talk about the increase to
 
06:50:45.670 --> 06:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
people who are trying to pump their
 
06:50:47.830 --> 06:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
septuage tanks i have a septic tank
 
06:50:50.150 --> 06:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
personally that it doubles we're talking
 
06:50:52.628 --> 06:50:52.638 align:start position:0%
about rates in the town of merrimack
 
06:50:55.190 --> 06:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
quadrupling if you have to now start
 
06:50:57.830 --> 06:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
disposing of sludge off-site
 
06:51:01.270 --> 06:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
so it's a very big problem and the first
 
06:51:04.150 --> 06:51:04.160 align:start position:0%
step in any big problem like this is to
 
06:51:06.548 --> 06:51:06.558 align:start position:0%
understand it and that's what i believe
 
06:51:08.788 --> 06:51:08.798 align:start position:0%
this the intent of this was it was to
 
06:51:11.350 --> 06:51:11.360 align:start position:0%
try and understand what are the sources
 
06:51:14.230 --> 06:51:14.240 align:start position:0%
where are they coming from and
 
06:51:16.548 --> 06:51:16.558 align:start position:0%
i can tell you from personal experience
 
06:51:18.868 --> 06:51:18.878 align:start position:0%
of asking an industry
 
06:51:21.670 --> 06:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
to sample and to correct some issues all
 
06:51:24.390 --> 06:51:24.400 align:start position:0%
we got is thousands upon thousands upon
 
06:51:27.510 --> 06:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars of legal action
 
06:51:29.670 --> 06:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
where their lawyers will send us letters
 
06:51:31.430 --> 06:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
saying that we don't have the legal
 
06:51:34.868 --> 06:51:34.878 align:start position:0%
authority so even if it just clarifies
 
06:51:37.270 --> 06:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
the fact that we have the authority to
 
06:51:39.590 --> 06:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
take care of these issues that would
 
06:51:41.430 --> 06:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
help us the next the other thing i want
 
06:51:43.510 --> 06:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
to point out is
 
06:51:43.520 --> 06:51:44.468 align:start position:0%
to point out is
uh

06:51:44.468 --> 06:51:44.478 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:51:46.628 --> 06:51:46.638 align:start position:0%
what ds was talking about
 
06:51:48.868 --> 06:51:48.878 align:start position:0%
with regard to the program where we can
 
06:51:51.190 --> 06:51:51.200 align:start position:0%
require people to sample that's called
 
06:51:53.590 --> 06:51:53.600 align:start position:0%
the pre-treatment program
 
06:51:56.310 --> 06:51:56.320 align:start position:0%
40 cfr part 403 the pre-treatment
 
06:51:59.110 --> 06:51:59.120 align:start position:0%
program has a lot of rules in it and in
 
06:52:01.590 --> 06:52:01.600 align:start position:0%
those rules they specifically state what
 
06:52:04.230 --> 06:52:04.240 align:start position:0%
we can and can't regulate it's not as
 
06:52:06.070 --> 06:52:06.080 align:start position:0%
simple as just adding something to our
 
06:52:08.628 --> 06:52:08.638 align:start position:0%
sewer use ordinance it has to go to new
 
06:52:11.430 --> 06:52:11.440 align:start position:0%
to epa for approval it has to go to des
 
06:52:12.948 --> 06:52:12.958 align:start position:0%
for approval it also has to go to a
 
06:52:15.030 --> 06:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
public notice so we can't just
 
06:52:17.110 --> 06:52:17.120 align:start position:0%
arbitrarily add things and say okay we
 
06:52:19.590 --> 06:52:19.600 align:start position:0%
just want to do this so there's a lot of
 
06:52:21.750 --> 06:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
stuff here a lot of bureaucracy here
 
06:52:23.430 --> 06:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
that just isn't working
 
06:52:25.350 --> 06:52:25.360 align:start position:0%
and that's what we were hoping with this
 
06:52:27.910 --> 06:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
particular legislation that we could get
 
06:52:30.310 --> 06:52:30.320 align:start position:0%
something in there that could help us do
 
06:52:32.708 --> 06:52:32.718 align:start position:0%
our jobs better so that we don't have to
 
06:52:34.468 --> 06:52:34.478 align:start position:0%
increase the rates
 
06:52:36.150 --> 06:52:36.160 align:start position:0%
of our customers in the town of
 
06:52:39.350 --> 06:52:39.360 align:start position:0%
merrimack three and four fold
 
06:52:40.948 --> 06:52:40.958 align:start position:0%
oh and i'm in support of the bill thank
 
06:52:40.958 --> 06:52:46.150 align:start position:0%
oh and i'm in support of the bill thank
you

06:52:46.150 --> 06:52:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:54.468 --> 06:52:54.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:54.478 --> 06:52:55.670 align:start position:0%
 
hi

06:52:55.670 --> 06:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
hi
 
06:52:57.430 --> 06:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question ma'am
 
06:53:00.468 --> 06:53:00.478 align:start position:0%
um you talked about agarose source is a
 
06:53:01.750 --> 06:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
product or a company that you've
 
06:53:03.270 --> 06:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
partnered with to
 
06:53:05.270 --> 06:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
market the end product can you be a
 
06:53:06.548 --> 06:53:06.558 align:start position:0%
little more specific of what the end
 
06:53:07.590 --> 06:53:07.600 align:start position:0%
product is
 
06:53:10.548 --> 06:53:10.558 align:start position:0%
that is the compost so that's the sludge
 
06:53:12.948 --> 06:53:12.958 align:start position:0%
that we mix with sawdust and we put
 
06:53:15.990 --> 06:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
through an in-vessel composting facility
 
06:53:18.390 --> 06:53:18.400 align:start position:0%
where we raise the temperature we mix it
 
06:53:20.390 --> 06:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
and on the other end we get a marketable
 
06:53:22.468 --> 06:53:22.478 align:start position:0%
product and agrosource is the company
 
06:53:24.548 --> 06:53:24.558 align:start position:0%
that actually markets it for us
 
06:53:26.628 --> 06:53:26.638 align:start position:0%
so when you say marketable product sorry
 
06:53:28.628 --> 06:53:28.638 align:start position:0%
follow up mr chair my apologies
 
06:53:31.110 --> 06:53:31.120 align:start position:0%
uh what marketing
 
06:53:33.350 --> 06:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
what to whom what is the product and how
 
06:53:34.310 --> 06:53:34.320 align:start position:0%
do you
 
06:53:35.990 --> 06:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
who are there who's a potential client
 
06:53:37.750 --> 06:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
for it oh excellent question so it's a
 
06:53:39.910 --> 06:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
class a biosolids it's actually a low
 
06:53:41.910 --> 06:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
metals biosolid
 
06:53:44.548 --> 06:53:44.558 align:start position:0%
it goes to golf courses we've actually
 
06:53:46.788 --> 06:53:46.798 align:start position:0%
sold it to central park it actually
 
06:53:49.190 --> 06:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
ended up in central park once i think
 
06:53:50.868 --> 06:53:50.878 align:start position:0%
it's been to a couple of the sports
 
06:53:52.788 --> 06:53:52.798 align:start position:0%
fields in the area
 
06:53:55.510 --> 06:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
our product is not used in agriculture
 
06:53:56.468 --> 06:53:56.478 align:start position:0%
at all
 
06:53:58.948 --> 06:53:58.958 align:start position:0%
but it's used for top dressing and i
 
06:54:00.788 --> 06:54:00.798 align:start position:0%
also want to make a point uh this is not
 
06:54:03.590 --> 06:54:03.600 align:start position:0%
a fertilizer it's an amendment so it's a
 
06:54:05.750 --> 06:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
it's a material that has a high nutrient
 
06:54:09.270 --> 06:54:09.280 align:start position:0%
value with a low carbon threshold
 
06:54:12.070 --> 06:54:12.080 align:start position:0%
in the letter i point out that the
 
06:54:15.670 --> 06:54:15.680 align:start position:0%
product has a low carbon footprint so
 
06:54:16.788 --> 06:54:16.798 align:start position:0%
we're all concerned about those
 
06:54:19.590 --> 06:54:19.600 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gases and ozone and all of
 
06:54:20.868 --> 06:54:20.878 align:start position:0%
that stuff
 
06:54:23.350 --> 06:54:23.360 align:start position:0%
this type of approach to managing our
 
06:54:26.390 --> 06:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
sludge helps lower that greenhouse
 
06:54:29.110 --> 06:54:29.120 align:start position:0%
footprint it helps bring it down so that
 
06:54:31.990 --> 06:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
we are not attacking that ozone layer
 
06:54:33.590 --> 06:54:33.600 align:start position:0%
did i answer your question
 
06:54:35.110 --> 06:54:35.120 align:start position:0%
yeah you did um
 
06:54:37.190 --> 06:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
for the record mr chair i'd like to note
 
06:54:38.868 --> 06:54:38.878 align:start position:0%
that this
 
06:54:41.110 --> 06:54:41.120 align:start position:0%
topic could be usable in previous
 
06:54:42.948 --> 06:54:42.958 align:start position:0%
testimony we heard today regarding the
 
06:54:42.958 --> 06:54:44.070 align:start position:0%
testimony we heard today regarding the
commission

06:54:44.070 --> 06:54:44.080 align:start position:0%
commission
 
06:54:47.110 --> 06:54:47.120 align:start position:0%
that was a bill uh crawford
 
06:54:49.590 --> 06:54:49.600 align:start position:0%
uh regarding what to do with
 
06:54:51.510 --> 06:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
wastewood because she said the magic
 
06:54:54.548 --> 06:54:54.558 align:start position:0%
word for me which was sawdust
 
06:54:55.750 --> 06:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
that's why i wanted to ask more about
 
06:54:57.430 --> 06:54:57.440 align:start position:0%
the product i appreciate your indulging
 
06:54:59.270 --> 06:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
me and thank you ma'am so much for your
 
06:54:59.280 --> 06:55:00.868 align:start position:0%
me and thank you ma'am so much for your
information

06:55:00.868 --> 06:55:00.878 align:start position:0%
information
 
06:55:02.468 --> 06:55:02.478 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:55:04.230 --> 06:55:04.240 align:start position:0%
any more questions
 
06:55:04.240 --> 06:55:06.948 align:start position:0%
any more questions
representative

06:55:06.948 --> 06:55:06.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:06.958 --> 06:55:08.070 align:start position:0%
 
thank creighton

06:55:08.070 --> 06:55:08.080 align:start position:0%
thank creighton
 
06:55:11.110 --> 06:55:11.120 align:start position:0%
ma'am um i appreciate your passionate
 
06:55:13.430 --> 06:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
and knowledgeable testimony
 
06:55:16.070 --> 06:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
um i'm trying to connect two dots
 
06:55:16.080 --> 06:55:17.190 align:start position:0%
um i'm trying to connect two dots
uh

06:55:17.190 --> 06:55:17.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:55:19.270 --> 06:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
if you could just explain further
 
06:55:21.190 --> 06:55:21.200 align:start position:0%
we had previous testimonies saying that
 
06:55:23.350 --> 06:55:23.360 align:start position:0%
this is already in legislation
 
06:55:24.948 --> 06:55:24.958 align:start position:0%
it was already legal
 
06:55:26.468 --> 06:55:26.478 align:start position:0%
and yet
 
06:55:29.270 --> 06:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
you have problems with legal aspects of
 
06:55:32.468 --> 06:55:32.478 align:start position:0%
this can you clarify that for me i i'm
 
06:55:34.868 --> 06:55:34.878 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to understand so i
 
06:55:37.590 --> 06:55:37.600 align:start position:0%
believe what was said is that the rsa
 
06:55:39.990 --> 06:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
exists where the town or the community
 
06:55:41.590 --> 06:55:41.600 align:start position:0%
can put it in their what's called a
 
06:55:43.910 --> 06:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
sewer use ordinance so the sewer use
 
06:55:46.788 --> 06:55:46.798 align:start position:0%
ordinance is the laws by which the town
 
06:55:48.868 --> 06:55:48.878 align:start position:0%
and community run their particular
 
06:55:51.670 --> 06:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
community our sewers use ordinance which
 
06:55:53.510 --> 06:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
is 158
 
06:55:55.830 --> 06:55:55.840 align:start position:0%
gives all the rules associated with what
 
06:55:58.390 --> 06:55:58.400 align:start position:0%
we can and can't do so for example it
 
06:56:01.430 --> 06:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
sets limits on things like copper lead
 
06:56:02.708 --> 06:56:02.718 align:start position:0%
or anything like that that's in
 
06:56:05.190 --> 06:56:05.200 align:start position:0%
wastewater for industrial users
 
06:56:05.200 --> 06:56:05.990 align:start position:0%
wastewater for industrial users
so

06:56:05.990 --> 06:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:56:08.548 --> 06:56:08.558 align:start position:0%
the fact that it exists doesn't mean
 
06:56:10.868 --> 06:56:10.878 align:start position:0%
that it's in place right now so we would
 
06:56:12.230 --> 06:56:12.240 align:start position:0%
have to put
 
06:56:14.868 --> 06:56:14.878 align:start position:0%
those regulations in our sewer use
 
06:56:17.430 --> 06:56:17.440 align:start position:0%
ordinance first and foremost now you
 
06:56:19.830 --> 06:56:19.840 align:start position:0%
know in when we put it in our sewer use
 
06:56:22.230 --> 06:56:22.240 align:start position:0%
ordinance there's a process and usually
 
06:56:24.310 --> 06:56:24.320 align:start position:0%
we have to have a basis for putting it
 
06:56:27.350 --> 06:56:27.360 align:start position:0%
in so for example um the federal
 
06:56:29.510 --> 06:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
government says that if you run a
 
06:56:31.430 --> 06:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
certain type of industry
 
06:56:34.230 --> 06:56:34.240 align:start position:0%
you can't discharge x y and z above a
 
06:56:36.708 --> 06:56:36.718 align:start position:0%
certain concentration then what we do is
 
06:56:38.708 --> 06:56:38.718 align:start position:0%
we go back and say okay
 
06:56:40.628 --> 06:56:40.638 align:start position:0%
we do what's called a local limit study
 
06:56:42.788 --> 06:56:42.798 align:start position:0%
we evaluate all that and then we'll come
 
06:56:45.350 --> 06:56:45.360 align:start position:0%
up with local limits we will submit them
 
06:56:48.548 --> 06:56:48.558 align:start position:0%
to epa epa will look at them then they
 
06:56:50.150 --> 06:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
will have a public notice and it will
 
06:56:51.750 --> 06:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
end up going into our sewer use
 
06:56:51.760 --> 06:56:52.788 align:start position:0%
end up going into our sewer use
ordinance

06:56:52.788 --> 06:56:52.798 align:start position:0%
ordinance
 
06:56:54.708 --> 06:56:54.718 align:start position:0%
so all of that doesn't exist right now
 
06:56:56.468 --> 06:56:56.478 align:start position:0%
as evidenced by all the legal action
 
06:56:59.510 --> 06:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
that has been taken against us
 
06:56:59.520 --> 06:57:00.708 align:start position:0%
that has been taken against us
and

06:57:00.708 --> 06:57:00.718 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:57:00.718 --> 06:57:01.590 align:start position:0%
and
while

06:57:01.590 --> 06:57:01.600 align:start position:0%
while
 
06:57:03.030 --> 06:57:03.040 align:start position:0%
i guess it's a
 
06:57:03.040 --> 06:57:03.750 align:start position:0%
i guess it's a
a

06:57:03.750 --> 06:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:57:06.230 --> 06:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
discussion of you know
 
06:57:09.110 --> 06:57:09.120 align:start position:0%
a higher level discussion
 
06:57:11.190 --> 06:57:11.200 align:start position:0%
what is there right now from a practical
 
06:57:13.510 --> 06:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
standpoint from the wastewater treatment
 
06:57:15.350 --> 06:57:15.360 align:start position:0%
plant who's dealing with it
 
06:57:18.230 --> 06:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
it it's not effective
 
06:57:20.628 --> 06:57:20.638 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up sir
 
06:57:20.638 --> 06:57:21.670 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up sir
so

06:57:21.670 --> 06:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:57:23.510 --> 06:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
okay understand so it's there but it's
 
06:57:25.990 --> 06:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
not effective so it's not implementable
 
06:57:29.350 --> 06:57:29.360 align:start position:0%
how does 1185 help you
 
06:57:31.110 --> 06:57:31.120 align:start position:0%
in implementation
 
06:57:33.270 --> 06:57:33.280 align:start position:0%
because it makes it clear
 
06:57:36.788 --> 06:57:36.798 align:start position:0%
to everyone that the town of merrimack
 
06:57:38.708 --> 06:57:38.718 align:start position:0%
has the authority the wastewater
 
06:57:39.670 --> 06:57:39.680 align:start position:0%
treatment plant under their
 
06:57:41.990 --> 06:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
pre-treatment program has the authority
 
06:57:44.948 --> 06:57:44.958 align:start position:0%
to go to various commercial
 
06:57:44.958 --> 06:57:46.948 align:start position:0%
to go to various commercial
um

06:57:46.948 --> 06:57:46.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:57:49.270 --> 06:57:49.280 align:start position:0%
and industrial facilities and say to
 
06:57:52.150 --> 06:57:52.160 align:start position:0%
them you guys do need to go back you do
 
06:57:55.190 --> 06:57:55.200 align:start position:0%
need to address or sample for pfas
 
06:57:57.110 --> 06:57:57.120 align:start position:0%
compounds and by the way i'm not
 
06:57:59.350 --> 06:57:59.360 align:start position:0%
concerned with the four because from a
 
06:58:00.868 --> 06:58:00.878 align:start position:0%
perspective of
 
06:58:04.150 --> 06:58:04.160 align:start position:0%
septage uh i mean uh from compost i have
 
06:58:06.150 --> 06:58:06.160 align:start position:0%
to test for 20 plus
 
06:58:07.990 --> 06:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
so i have to make sure more than the
 
06:58:09.830 --> 06:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
four are not in there
 
06:58:11.670 --> 06:58:11.680 align:start position:0%
it gives us that authority to go back to
 
06:58:13.190 --> 06:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
them and ask them to give us this
 
06:58:15.830 --> 06:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
information and hopefully we don't have
 
06:58:18.310 --> 06:58:18.320 align:start position:0%
to deal with as much legal action
 
06:58:23.350 --> 06:58:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:28.150 --> 06:58:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:30.468 --> 06:58:30.478 align:start position:0%
representative post thank you very much
 
06:58:33.270 --> 06:58:33.280 align:start position:0%
mr chairman um
 
06:58:36.390 --> 06:58:36.400 align:start position:0%
uh someone here previously um testified
 
06:58:39.350 --> 06:58:39.360 align:start position:0%
he was a septic caller that if he had to
 
06:58:39.360 --> 06:58:40.868 align:start position:0%
he was a septic caller that if he had to
test

06:58:40.868 --> 06:58:40.878 align:start position:0%
test
 
06:58:43.750 --> 06:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
and and the problems that
 
06:58:45.430 --> 06:58:45.440 align:start position:0%
you know
 
06:58:47.510 --> 06:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
goes with the testing and that he would
 
06:58:49.270 --> 06:58:49.280 align:start position:0%
have to do it two weeks
 
06:58:52.390 --> 06:58:52.400 align:start position:0%
you know in advance and the cost and and
 
06:58:54.468 --> 06:58:54.478 align:start position:0%
then what what would he do with it if he
 
06:58:54.478 --> 06:58:56.468 align:start position:0%
then what what would he do with it if he
couldn't

06:58:56.468 --> 06:58:56.478 align:start position:0%
couldn't
 
06:58:59.750 --> 06:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
bring it anywhere so that's in the spill
 
06:59:02.628 --> 06:59:02.638 align:start position:0%
how does that affect you or help you
 
06:59:05.910 --> 06:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
so um had i what i pointed out earlier
 
06:59:08.708 --> 06:59:08.718 align:start position:0%
is if we have a
 
06:59:11.750 --> 06:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh customer in the town of merrimack we
 
06:59:14.468 --> 06:59:14.478 align:start position:0%
can't not accept that septage so that
 
06:59:16.628 --> 06:59:16.638 align:start position:0%
that issue doesn't exist in terms of the
 
06:59:18.070 --> 06:59:18.080 align:start position:0%
town of merrimack
 
06:59:18.080 --> 06:59:19.270 align:start position:0%
town of merrimack
um

06:59:19.270 --> 06:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:59:19.280 --> 06:59:20.390 align:start position:0%
um
the

06:59:20.390 --> 06:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:59:22.390 --> 06:59:22.400 align:start position:0%
approach and i would be and i would
 
06:59:25.190 --> 06:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
think this would be a wise decision the
 
06:59:25.200 --> 06:59:25.910 align:start position:0%
think this would be a wise decision the
the

06:59:25.910 --> 06:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:59:27.590 --> 06:59:27.600 align:start position:0%
interest with septic haulers is
 
06:59:29.750 --> 06:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
understanding what is coming from septic
 
06:59:32.948 --> 06:59:32.958 align:start position:0%
haulers so now let's use an example i i
 
06:59:35.590 --> 06:59:35.600 align:start position:0%
work at a particular facility or i work
 
06:59:37.110 --> 06:59:37.120 align:start position:0%
at a commercial facility and they
 
06:59:38.868 --> 06:59:38.878 align:start position:0%
cleaned their floors and they stripped
 
06:59:40.788 --> 06:59:40.798 align:start position:0%
them and everything went to their septic
 
06:59:42.868 --> 06:59:42.878 align:start position:0%
tank they went and they pumped it then
 
06:59:45.750 --> 06:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
they came over and they dumped it in
 
06:59:47.590 --> 06:59:47.600 align:start position:0%
the wastewater treatment plant the idea
 
06:59:49.750 --> 06:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
is that you'd be able to sample that not
 
06:59:52.230 --> 06:59:52.240 align:start position:0%
necessarily that we would reject it
 
06:59:54.070 --> 06:59:54.080 align:start position:0%
but you'd be able to sample it you'd be
 
06:59:55.910 --> 06:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
able to figure out what's in there so
 
06:59:58.230 --> 06:59:58.240 align:start position:0%
that we know as we move forward in this
 
07:00:00.150 --> 07:00:00.160 align:start position:0%
process of trying to figure out what to
 
07:00:02.468 --> 07:00:02.478 align:start position:0%
do with all of this stuff how to manage
 
07:00:02.478 --> 07:00:03.830 align:start position:0%
do with all of this stuff how to manage
it

07:00:03.830 --> 07:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
it
 
07:00:05.910 --> 07:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
that one car wash that i talked about
 
07:00:07.830 --> 07:00:07.840 align:start position:0%
that came back non-detect for all these
 
07:00:09.430 --> 07:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
pfas compounds well wouldn't it be
 
07:00:11.590 --> 07:00:11.600 align:start position:0%
wonderful if another car wash that had
 
07:00:13.670 --> 07:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
pfas compounds in it we could have these
 
07:00:15.510 --> 07:00:15.520 align:start position:0%
guys talk and say hey you may want to
 
07:00:16.868 --> 07:00:16.878 align:start position:0%
talk to these people because they're
 
07:00:19.110 --> 07:00:19.120 align:start position:0%
using something that doesn't have pfas
 
07:00:21.910 --> 07:00:21.920 align:start position:0%
so i think from our perspective it's
 
07:00:24.230 --> 07:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
that education it's that ability to
 
07:00:26.468 --> 07:00:26.478 align:start position:0%
figure out where it's all coming from so
 
07:00:28.628 --> 07:00:28.638 align:start position:0%
that we who manage wastewater treatment
 
07:00:30.708 --> 07:00:30.718 align:start position:0%
plants who are in the business of making
 
07:00:33.590 --> 07:00:33.600 align:start position:0%
clean water can do it responsibly and
 
07:00:36.070 --> 07:00:36.080 align:start position:0%
figure out how we can continue to
 
07:00:39.190 --> 07:00:39.200 align:start position:0%
make a marketable product like compost
 
07:00:41.670 --> 07:00:41.680 align:start position:0%
that's a recyclable material that would
 
07:00:56.070 --> 07:00:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:02.708 --> 07:01:02.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:17.990 --> 07:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:20.548 --> 07:01:20.558 align:start position:0%
um i i think a clarification may be
 
07:01:22.788 --> 07:01:22.798 align:start position:0%
warranted in that regard so the intent
 
07:01:25.750 --> 07:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
isn't to not accept it's more to figure
 
07:01:31.590 --> 07:01:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:33.670 --> 07:01:33.680 align:start position:0%
representative dodge
 
07:01:35.110 --> 07:01:35.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
07:01:36.390 --> 07:01:36.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
07:01:37.670 --> 07:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
you may have touched on this just a
 
07:01:40.070 --> 07:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
little bit uh to representative post's
 
07:01:41.430 --> 07:01:41.440 align:start position:0%
question but um
 
07:01:43.750 --> 07:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
what happens to the 16 towns that do
 
07:01:45.670 --> 07:01:45.680 align:start position:0%
send the sludge
 
07:01:49.270 --> 07:01:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:50.948 --> 07:01:50.958 align:start position:0%
they have to find a
 
07:01:53.510 --> 07:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
another outlet for it and so that's what
 
07:01:56.150 --> 07:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
i was talking about landfilling their
 
07:01:59.468 --> 07:01:59.478 align:start position:0%
cost would go probably from you know
 
07:02:02.310 --> 07:02:02.320 align:start position:0%
393 000 which is what those eight
 
07:02:05.510 --> 07:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
communities are charged by us to in
 
07:02:07.830 --> 07:02:07.840 align:start position:0%
excess of one or two million dollars a
 
07:02:09.510 --> 07:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
year so it would be a huge impact to the
 
07:02:09.520 --> 07:02:12.628 align:start position:0%
year so it would be a huge impact to the
communities

07:02:12.628 --> 07:02:12.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:14.548 --> 07:02:14.558 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:02:16.788 --> 07:02:16.798 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
07:02:20.230 --> 07:02:20.240 align:start position:0%
seeing that thank you very much
 
07:02:21.270 --> 07:02:21.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:02:25.510 --> 07:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:28.628 --> 07:02:28.638 align:start position:0%
so i'll declare
 
07:02:32.670 --> 07:02:32.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:32.680 --> 07:02:34.670 align:start position:0%
 
1185

07:02:34.670 --> 07:02:34.680 align:start position:0%
1185
 
07:02:37.510 --> 07:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
to adjourned
 
07:02:40.990 --> 07:02:41.000 align:start position:0%
and uh we'll move into house bill
 
07:02:44.948 --> 07:02:44.958 align:start position:0%
1602 fn relative to perfluorinated
 
07:02:44.958 --> 07:02:46.310 align:start position:0%
1602 fn relative to perfluorinated
chemicals

07:02:46.310 --> 07:02:46.320 align:start position:0%
chemicals
 
07:02:54.150 --> 07:02:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:57.110 --> 07:02:57.120 align:start position:0%
okay hello cheer hello champ person and
 
07:02:59.190 --> 07:02:59.200 align:start position:0%
fellow um committee members it's
 
07:03:04.868 --> 07:03:04.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:07.510 --> 07:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
uh i am a co-sponsor of this bill our
 
07:03:09.030 --> 07:03:09.040 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor
 
07:03:11.750 --> 07:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
is out with cobit so i'll do my best to
 
07:03:14.070 --> 07:03:14.080 align:start position:0%
introduce and position this bill
 
07:03:15.910 --> 07:03:15.920 align:start position:0%
and then after we hear the testimony we
 
07:03:17.750 --> 07:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
can decide if our next steps is to
 
07:03:19.750 --> 07:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
workshop it or discuss it at a public
 
07:03:21.990 --> 07:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
executive session but let me explain the
 
07:03:24.390 --> 07:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
bill to you right now
 
07:03:26.230 --> 07:03:26.240 align:start position:0%
this is a bill
 
07:03:28.868 --> 07:03:28.878 align:start position:0%
that is another one of the bills dealing
 
07:03:32.708 --> 07:03:32.718 align:start position:0%
with the pfas situation in our state
 
07:03:34.390 --> 07:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
the type of bills that were we've been
 
07:03:36.468 --> 07:03:36.478 align:start position:0%
looking at as a committee with pfas
 
07:03:39.190 --> 07:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
either identify the problem
 
07:03:41.350 --> 07:03:41.360 align:start position:0%
protect the new hampshire residents from
 
07:03:43.910 --> 07:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
the problem or remediate the problem
 
07:03:46.230 --> 07:03:46.240 align:start position:0%
this bill is a bill that falls in the
 
07:03:49.430 --> 07:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
category of really identification
 
07:03:52.948 --> 07:03:52.958 align:start position:0%
the sponsors are across state sponsors
 
07:03:55.750 --> 07:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
including my colleague from merrimack
 
07:03:58.150 --> 07:03:58.160 align:start position:0%
representative boyd who is a um
 
07:04:03.590 --> 07:04:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:03.600 --> 07:04:04.868 align:start position:0%
 
so

07:04:04.868 --> 07:04:04.878 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:04:06.948 --> 07:04:06.958 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we received about
 
07:04:08.230 --> 07:04:08.240 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
07:04:10.548 --> 07:04:10.558 align:start position:0%
was a letter from the des and i'm hoping
 
07:04:12.788 --> 07:04:12.798 align:start position:0%
they're here to present today
 
07:04:14.868 --> 07:04:14.878 align:start position:0%
it's my intent to work with the prime
 
07:04:16.468 --> 07:04:16.478 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this bill
 
07:04:17.910 --> 07:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
to position an
 
07:04:19.910 --> 07:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
amendment to our group to uh our
 
07:04:21.990 --> 07:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
committee to look at that will address
 
07:04:24.788 --> 07:04:24.798 align:start position:0%
some of the issues that the um dsds had
 
07:04:26.070 --> 07:04:26.080 align:start position:0%
brought up they brought up the issue
 
07:04:28.390 --> 07:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
this this original bill
 
07:04:30.390 --> 07:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
really uh calls for
 
07:04:32.788 --> 07:04:32.798 align:start position:0%
testing in a school system everything
 
07:04:35.590 --> 07:04:35.600 align:start position:0%
the bubblers the sinks everything
 
07:04:37.990 --> 07:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
um i'm looking at an amendment that
 
07:04:38.000 --> 07:04:38.788 align:start position:0%
um i'm looking at an amendment that
we'll

07:04:38.788 --> 07:04:38.798 align:start position:0%
we'll
 
07:04:40.548 --> 07:04:40.558 align:start position:0%
address that we're just testing at the
 
07:04:42.868 --> 07:04:42.878 align:start position:0%
source of where this polluted water or
 
07:04:44.788 --> 07:04:44.798 align:start position:0%
non-polluted water comes in
 
07:04:46.708 --> 07:04:46.718 align:start position:0%
a second issue
 
07:04:49.430 --> 07:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
is that it really will not pertain to
 
07:04:51.590 --> 07:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
schools that are in municipal
 
07:04:52.948 --> 07:04:52.958 align:start position:0%
water because
 
07:04:55.110 --> 07:04:55.120 align:start position:0%
schools on municipal water already being
 
07:04:58.230 --> 07:04:58.240 align:start position:0%
tested for pfas and the third issue that
 
07:05:00.468 --> 07:05:00.478 align:start position:0%
needs to be addressed is that the size
 
07:05:02.868 --> 07:05:02.878 align:start position:0%
of the school uh right now schools with
 
07:05:06.628 --> 07:05:06.638 align:start position:0%
less than 25 people are exempt from this
 
07:05:08.468 --> 07:05:08.478 align:start position:0%
we probably don't want to exempt anybody
 
07:05:10.788 --> 07:05:10.798 align:start position:0%
in the protection here
 
07:05:13.030 --> 07:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of where i that's kind of
 
07:05:15.910 --> 07:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
where i am with this bill i think des is
 
07:05:18.788 --> 07:05:18.798 align:start position:0%
here to testify as well and like i say
 
07:05:19.990 --> 07:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
if this i'll try to answer your
 
07:05:22.230 --> 07:05:22.240 align:start position:0%
questions on intent of the bill
 
07:05:24.390 --> 07:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
once we're finished with any testimonies
 
07:05:25.910 --> 07:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
say we can decide
 
07:05:27.110 --> 07:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
what our next steps are with the
 
07:05:29.270 --> 07:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
chairperson workshop public workshop or
 
07:05:31.590 --> 07:05:31.600 align:start position:0%
just public discussion in our executive
 
07:05:31.600 --> 07:05:33.030 align:start position:0%
just public discussion in our executive
session

07:05:33.030 --> 07:05:33.040 align:start position:0%
session
 
07:05:33.040 --> 07:05:33.910 align:start position:0%
session
so

07:05:33.910 --> 07:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:05:36.548 --> 07:05:36.558 align:start position:0%
i'm ready for any questions
 
07:05:38.788 --> 07:05:38.798 align:start position:0%
mr chairperson
 
07:05:39.830 --> 07:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
and he
 
07:05:42.708 --> 07:05:42.718 align:start position:0%
mr chairs he's fine
 
07:05:45.270 --> 07:05:45.280 align:start position:0%
sir just don't call me late for supper
 
07:05:45.280 --> 07:05:46.390 align:start position:0%
sir just don't call me late for supper
uh

07:05:46.390 --> 07:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:05:48.390 --> 07:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
07:05:50.948 --> 07:05:50.958 align:start position:0%
any questions from the uh
 
07:05:55.830 --> 07:05:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:55.840 --> 07:05:57.510 align:start position:0%
 
uh

07:05:57.510 --> 07:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:05:59.030 --> 07:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
07:06:01.430 --> 07:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
and realizing that you're pinch hitting
 
07:06:01.440 --> 07:06:02.628 align:start position:0%
and realizing that you're pinch hitting
uh

07:06:02.628 --> 07:06:02.638 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:06:03.670 --> 07:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
i think
 
07:06:03.680 --> 07:06:04.548 align:start position:0%
i think
we'll

07:06:04.548 --> 07:06:04.558 align:start position:0%
we'll
 
07:06:06.468 --> 07:06:06.478 align:start position:0%
let you sit down and uh
 
07:06:08.468 --> 07:06:08.478 align:start position:0%
have only one
 
07:06:11.430 --> 07:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
only one card so far
 
07:06:11.440 --> 07:06:13.030 align:start position:0%
only one card so far
uh

07:06:13.030 --> 07:06:13.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:06:16.948 --> 07:06:16.958 align:start position:0%
is uh brandon kernan
 
07:06:29.030 --> 07:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:31.510 --> 07:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
representative cohen could you hand in a
 
07:07:11.830 --> 07:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:13.270 --> 07:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman thank you members of
 
07:07:14.868 --> 07:07:14.878 align:start position:0%
the committee i'm brandon kernan i'm the
 
07:07:16.468 --> 07:07:16.478 align:start position:0%
administrator of the drinking water and
 
07:07:18.468 --> 07:07:18.478 align:start position:0%
groundwater bureau at bes
 
07:07:21.510 --> 07:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
here to testify on house bill 1602
 
07:07:23.750 --> 07:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
um as mentioned we
 
07:07:25.830 --> 07:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
provided a letter
 
07:07:27.190 --> 07:07:27.200 align:start position:0%
and we'd be happy to work with the
 
07:07:29.270 --> 07:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
representative on on amendments to the
 
07:07:32.230 --> 07:07:32.240 align:start position:0%
bill as he alluded to before
 
07:07:33.990 --> 07:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
i'll be really brief
 
07:07:36.150 --> 07:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
we support the intent of the bill
 
07:07:38.150 --> 07:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
identifying exposure to pfas and
 
07:07:39.830 --> 07:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
drinking water and eliminating it is
 
07:07:42.628 --> 07:07:42.638 align:start position:0%
important we do believe there's a
 
07:07:44.708 --> 07:07:44.718 align:start position:0%
more efficient and cost effective way to
 
07:07:47.030 --> 07:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
achieve that outcome
 
07:07:49.750 --> 07:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
that would be by first of all as
 
07:07:51.670 --> 07:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
described previously only test a source
 
07:07:53.750 --> 07:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
of water not every fixture at each
 
07:07:53.760 --> 07:07:55.830 align:start position:0%
of water not every fixture at each
facility

07:07:55.830 --> 07:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
facility
 
07:07:57.830 --> 07:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
it was modeled this bill after the lead
 
07:08:00.070 --> 07:08:00.080 align:start position:0%
legislation where it does make sense to
 
07:08:02.548 --> 07:08:02.558 align:start position:0%
test every fixture for lead at a school
 
07:08:03.990 --> 07:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
and child care facility because the
 
07:08:05.590 --> 07:08:05.600 align:start position:0%
source of contamination can be the
 
07:08:08.310 --> 07:08:08.320 align:start position:0%
fixture or the local plumbing system
 
07:08:10.548 --> 07:08:10.558 align:start position:0%
but with pfast although hypothetically
 
07:08:12.548 --> 07:08:12.558 align:start position:0%
that could be the case we just haven't
 
07:08:14.390 --> 07:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
seen the plumbing system be a source of
 
07:08:16.230 --> 07:08:16.240 align:start position:0%
pfas contamination it's generally
 
07:08:18.390 --> 07:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
environmental contamination
 
07:08:20.468 --> 07:08:20.478 align:start position:0%
and it's important to distinguish
 
07:08:21.990 --> 07:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
the difference between testing just a
 
07:08:24.150 --> 07:08:24.160 align:start position:0%
source in a number of fixtures and some
 
07:08:26.390 --> 07:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
of these big schools could have 100 120
 
07:08:28.230 --> 07:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
fixtures if you go to every lab sink
 
07:08:31.270 --> 07:08:31.280 align:start position:0%
every bathroom kitchens nurses room all
 
07:08:31.280 --> 07:08:32.150 align:start position:0%
every bathroom kitchens nurses room all
that

07:08:32.150 --> 07:08:32.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:08:33.750 --> 07:08:33.760 align:start position:0%
and at two to three hundred dollars a
 
07:08:35.990 --> 07:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
sample that would be very costly and
 
07:08:37.910 --> 07:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
again i think you could achieve
 
07:08:39.350 --> 07:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
the same thing by just testing the
 
07:08:41.590 --> 07:08:41.600 align:start position:0%
source of water
 
07:08:43.990 --> 07:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
the other thing we're recommending is
 
07:08:44.000 --> 07:08:44.788 align:start position:0%
the other thing we're recommending is
that

07:08:44.788 --> 07:08:44.798 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:08:46.948 --> 07:08:46.958 align:start position:0%
any school that's a stand-alone public
 
07:08:48.390 --> 07:08:48.400 align:start position:0%
water system that means they have their
 
07:08:50.390 --> 07:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
own on-site well and served more than 25
 
07:08:51.830 --> 07:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
people of
 
07:08:53.190 --> 07:08:53.200 align:start position:0%
water a day
 
07:08:55.350 --> 07:08:55.360 align:start position:0%
or anyone or any school a child care
 
07:08:57.350 --> 07:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
facility that purchases water from a
 
07:08:58.708 --> 07:08:58.718 align:start position:0%
water system
 
07:09:01.030 --> 07:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
not be required to do any more testing
 
07:09:01.040 --> 07:09:02.390 align:start position:0%
not be required to do any more testing
because

07:09:02.390 --> 07:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
because
 
07:09:04.150 --> 07:09:04.160 align:start position:0%
already public water systems be it if
 
07:09:05.590 --> 07:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
they're their own public water system or
 
07:09:06.708 --> 07:09:06.718 align:start position:0%
if they're buying water from a public
 
07:09:08.468 --> 07:09:08.478 align:start position:0%
water system they've already tested four
 
07:09:11.110 --> 07:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
times for pfast and now have an ongoing
 
07:09:12.628 --> 07:09:12.638 align:start position:0%
requirement based on those initial
 
07:09:14.390 --> 07:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
results that could range from
 
07:09:18.310 --> 07:09:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:19.830 --> 07:09:19.840 align:start position:0%
we um
 
07:09:21.190 --> 07:09:21.200 align:start position:0%
do suggest in the letter that there's
 
07:09:21.200 --> 07:09:21.910 align:start position:0%
do suggest in the letter that there's
that

07:09:21.910 --> 07:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:09:23.910 --> 07:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
there's a subgroup of entities out there
 
07:09:25.990 --> 07:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
that don't have any testing requirement
 
07:09:27.510 --> 07:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
for pfas right now that would be the
 
07:09:30.070 --> 07:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
very small child care facilities
 
07:09:31.590 --> 07:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
and also the schools those that are
 
07:09:33.910 --> 07:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
serving less than 25 people
 
07:09:35.430 --> 07:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
obviously it'd be a big
 
07:09:37.510 --> 07:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
expense for a small
 
07:09:39.910 --> 07:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
entity to complete the sampling
 
07:09:41.430 --> 07:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
so one thing we
 
07:09:44.788 --> 07:09:44.798 align:start position:0%
suggest in our letter is that your des
 
07:09:47.670 --> 07:09:47.680 align:start position:0%
or health and human services
 
07:09:49.830 --> 07:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
could potentially sample those entities
 
07:09:51.910 --> 07:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
health and human services has a grant
 
07:09:54.150 --> 07:09:54.160 align:start position:0%
with the cdc called shoe safe places
 
07:09:56.070 --> 07:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
program that works on making sure
 
07:09:58.310 --> 07:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
environment environments for children
 
07:10:00.310 --> 07:10:00.320 align:start position:0%
are safe and they are contemplating
 
07:10:02.468 --> 07:10:02.478 align:start position:0%
doing voluntary sampling
 
07:10:05.190 --> 07:10:05.200 align:start position:0%
at uh child care facilities that don't
 
07:10:07.510 --> 07:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
have information on pfas
 
07:10:09.670 --> 07:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
and similarly des does have a sampling
 
07:10:13.030 --> 07:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
budget um to identify pfas contamination
 
07:10:14.868 --> 07:10:14.878 align:start position:0%
and we could assist in the next 18
 
07:10:17.510 --> 07:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
months with sampling those
 
07:10:19.190 --> 07:10:19.200 align:start position:0%
schools and child care facilities that
 
07:10:20.468 --> 07:10:20.478 align:start position:0%
don't have to
 
07:10:22.230 --> 07:10:22.240 align:start position:0%
sample or don't buy water from a system
 
07:10:24.230 --> 07:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
that does sample
 
07:10:25.750 --> 07:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
a little bit of a tricky part of all
 
07:10:27.670 --> 07:10:27.680 align:start position:0%
this is when you talk about
 
07:10:32.070 --> 07:10:32.080 align:start position:0%
child care facilities schools and then
 
07:10:33.670 --> 07:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
public water systems you've got three
 
07:10:35.430 --> 07:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
different agencies and lists involved
 
07:10:36.948 --> 07:10:36.958 align:start position:0%
you've got the schools the department of
 
07:10:36.958 --> 07:10:38.310 align:start position:0%
you've got the schools the department of
education

07:10:38.310 --> 07:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
education
 
07:10:39.910 --> 07:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
child care facilities is department
 
07:10:41.510 --> 07:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
health and human services and to the
 
07:10:42.548 --> 07:10:42.558 align:start position:0%
extent any of those are actually a
 
07:10:44.390 --> 07:10:44.400 align:start position:0%
public water system you have us
 
07:10:46.390 --> 07:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
and so when we work this out in a work
 
07:10:48.548 --> 07:10:48.558 align:start position:0%
group we really want to look at how we
 
07:10:50.230 --> 07:10:50.240 align:start position:0%
want to administer this if we want to
 
07:10:53.270 --> 07:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
make it mandatory or voluntary
 
07:10:54.468 --> 07:10:54.478 align:start position:0%
what is
 
07:10:56.468 --> 07:10:56.478 align:start position:0%
do you want to go in and work right now
 
07:10:57.750 --> 07:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
it's in the state drinking water act
 
07:10:59.350 --> 07:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
which is the es statute do you want to
 
07:11:01.270 --> 07:11:01.280 align:start position:0%
work in within the rules or regular
 
07:11:03.190 --> 07:11:03.200 align:start position:0%
statutes of the other programs instead
 
07:11:04.548 --> 07:11:04.558 align:start position:0%
for the entities that des doesn't
 
07:11:06.548 --> 07:11:06.558 align:start position:0%
currently regulate those are all things
 
07:11:08.468 --> 07:11:08.478 align:start position:0%
that we can hash out at a work group
 
07:11:08.478 --> 07:11:10.548 align:start position:0%
that we can hash out at a work group
level

07:11:10.548 --> 07:11:10.558 align:start position:0%
level
 
07:11:15.510 --> 07:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:17.190 --> 07:11:17.200 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
07:11:18.788 --> 07:11:18.798 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair for taking my
 
07:11:21.350 --> 07:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
question um in the letter uh thank you
 
07:11:24.948 --> 07:11:24.958 align:start position:0%
for being here today also um in the
 
07:11:26.708 --> 07:11:26.718 align:start position:0%
letter from uh
 
07:11:29.430 --> 07:11:29.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner scott he says 50 schools
 
07:11:32.788 --> 07:11:32.798 align:start position:0%
use on-site private wells
 
07:11:35.190 --> 07:11:35.200 align:start position:0%
um are these public schools are there
 
07:11:36.948 --> 07:11:36.958 align:start position:0%
public schools that are not on a
 
07:11:39.190 --> 07:11:39.200 align:start position:0%
municipal water are these all private
 
07:11:39.200 --> 07:11:40.230 align:start position:0%
municipal water are these all private
schools

07:11:40.230 --> 07:11:40.240 align:start position:0%
schools
 
07:11:42.150 --> 07:11:42.160 align:start position:0%
i would have to look at the list it's
 
07:11:45.350 --> 07:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
possible they could be public schools or
 
07:11:47.270 --> 07:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
even a preschool associate of the public
 
07:11:48.548 --> 07:11:48.558 align:start position:0%
school that's in a separate building
 
07:11:51.190 --> 07:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
than the school itself
 
07:11:55.590 --> 07:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:57.190 --> 07:11:57.200 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
07:12:00.150 --> 07:12:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:00.160 --> 07:12:01.030 align:start position:0%
 
one

07:12:01.030 --> 07:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
one
 
07:12:03.590 --> 07:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
one one question uh
 
07:12:06.788 --> 07:12:06.798 align:start position:0%
if for small
 
07:12:08.948 --> 07:12:08.958 align:start position:0%
small daycares
 
07:12:12.708 --> 07:12:12.718 align:start position:0%
maybe they had six kids 10 kids
 
07:12:14.868 --> 07:12:14.878 align:start position:0%
uh can they simply
 
07:12:14.878 --> 07:12:15.830 align:start position:0%
uh can they simply
say

07:12:15.830 --> 07:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
say
 
07:12:18.150 --> 07:12:18.160 align:start position:0%
we only serve bottled water here
 
07:12:20.468 --> 07:12:20.478 align:start position:0%
is that sufficient you have to test
 
07:12:24.310 --> 07:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
there well uh if they're serving to
 
07:12:26.788 --> 07:12:26.798 align:start position:0%
children bottled water
 
07:12:29.350 --> 07:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
are you using bottled water and cooking
 
07:12:31.270 --> 07:12:31.280 align:start position:0%
i would defer to health human services
 
07:12:33.430 --> 07:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
on what their rules allow obviously
 
07:12:35.830 --> 07:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
bottled water is one way to
 
07:12:35.840 --> 07:12:36.830 align:start position:0%
bottled water is one way to
eliminate

07:12:36.830 --> 07:12:36.840 align:start position:0%
eliminate
 
07:12:39.270 --> 07:12:39.280 align:start position:0%
exposure and at the extent they had that
 
07:12:40.788 --> 07:12:40.798 align:start position:0%
voluntary sample result they could
 
07:12:43.430 --> 07:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
choose that simple remedy yeah dhs yep
 
07:12:46.548 --> 07:12:46.558 align:start position:0%
vhs was yeah there would probably be the
 
07:12:46.558 --> 07:12:47.350 align:start position:0%
vhs was yeah there would probably be the
better

07:12:47.350 --> 07:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
better
 
07:12:50.868 --> 07:12:50.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:52.628 --> 07:12:52.638 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
07:12:54.788 --> 07:12:54.798 align:start position:0%
representative creighton
 
07:12:56.390 --> 07:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
um thank you for your letter thank you
 
07:12:57.590 --> 07:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
07:12:59.510 --> 07:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh if you talk to the sponsors of the
 
07:13:01.670 --> 07:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
bill regarding your suggestions and what
 
07:13:03.750 --> 07:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
was their response
 
07:13:05.750 --> 07:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
we have not talked to the sponsors i've
 
07:13:07.270 --> 07:13:07.280 align:start position:0%
had trouble reaching representative
 
07:13:09.750 --> 07:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
grass i've tried on other bills but we
 
07:13:11.750 --> 07:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
did in the fiscal note outline these
 
07:13:11.760 --> 07:13:12.868 align:start position:0%
did in the fiscal note outline these
issues

07:13:12.868 --> 07:13:12.878 align:start position:0%
issues
 
07:13:14.948 --> 07:13:14.958 align:start position:0%
where they asked for technical
 
07:13:17.990 --> 07:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
concerns or or improvements so hopefully
 
07:13:19.590 --> 07:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
that did get that's my understanding
 
07:13:20.948 --> 07:13:20.958 align:start position:0%
that's part of the fiscal notice to get
 
07:13:23.270 --> 07:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
conveyed back to the sponsor okay thank
 
07:13:23.280 --> 07:13:24.628 align:start position:0%
conveyed back to the sponsor okay thank
you

07:13:24.628 --> 07:13:24.638 align:start position:0%
you
 
07:13:26.070 --> 07:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
i will point out there is the fiscal
 
07:13:27.590 --> 07:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
note attached to the bill because as
 
07:13:29.110 --> 07:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
proposed it'd be a lot of work to
 
07:13:34.788 --> 07:13:34.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:36.628 --> 07:13:36.638 align:start position:0%
there's a fiscal note but i do not
 
07:13:40.230 --> 07:13:40.240 align:start position:0%
believe it's going on to uh
 
07:13:41.910 --> 07:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
you know i don't think it's an early
 
07:13:41.920 --> 07:13:42.948 align:start position:0%
you know i don't think it's an early
bill

07:13:42.948 --> 07:13:42.958 align:start position:0%
bill
 
07:13:43.990 --> 07:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
07:13:44.000 --> 07:13:44.708 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
uh

07:13:44.708 --> 07:13:44.718 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:13:46.468 --> 07:13:46.478 align:start position:0%
i don't believe it is an early bill i'd
 
07:13:49.350 --> 07:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
have to check but
 
07:13:52.468 --> 07:13:52.478 align:start position:0%
representative yeah thank you mr chair
 
07:13:55.430 --> 07:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
and um i was just looking at the fiscal
 
07:13:58.230 --> 07:13:58.240 align:start position:0%
note and you had mentioned that there
 
07:14:00.708 --> 07:14:00.718 align:start position:0%
could be grants that would cover the
 
07:14:03.030 --> 07:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
cost of testing is that
 
07:14:04.948 --> 07:14:04.958 align:start position:0%
i'm not quite sure i heard you correctly
 
07:14:06.230 --> 07:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to make sure because i'm
 
07:14:09.030 --> 07:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
looking at the 130 000.
 
07:14:11.910 --> 07:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
so the fiscal note is based on sampling
 
07:14:13.670 --> 07:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
every fixture in every child care
 
07:14:15.670 --> 07:14:15.680 align:start position:0%
facility in every school
 
07:14:15.680 --> 07:14:16.548 align:start position:0%
facility in every school
and

07:14:16.548 --> 07:14:16.558 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:14:19.110 --> 07:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
then it spreads it over five years
 
07:14:20.868 --> 07:14:20.878 align:start position:0%
for the number of schools
 
07:14:22.948 --> 07:14:22.958 align:start position:0%
and what we're proposing is we've
 
07:14:25.030 --> 07:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
identified out of the universe of child
 
07:14:28.150 --> 07:14:28.160 align:start position:0%
care facilities and schools about 150 of
 
07:14:30.548 --> 07:14:30.558 align:start position:0%
those two entities all together that may
 
07:14:32.150 --> 07:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
not be sampling for pfas because they're
 
07:14:33.830 --> 07:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
not required to because they're not a
 
07:14:37.350 --> 07:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
public water system and that des or hhs
 
07:14:40.310 --> 07:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
we both have opportunities to help help
 
07:14:42.310 --> 07:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
them do voluntary sampling but if they
 
07:14:44.628 --> 07:14:44.638 align:start position:0%
declined us we wouldn't have authority
 
07:14:47.190 --> 07:14:47.200 align:start position:0%
necessarily to make them do that
 
07:14:49.750 --> 07:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up or follow-up
 
07:14:52.390 --> 07:14:52.400 align:start position:0%
so the um so if i mean i think the
 
07:14:54.868 --> 07:14:54.878 align:start position:0%
suggestion of
 
07:14:57.750 --> 07:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
you know not testing all spots on the in
 
07:14:59.750 --> 07:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
the school all the fixtures is an
 
07:15:02.708 --> 07:15:02.718 align:start position:0%
excellent idea so that would lower this
 
07:15:09.910 --> 07:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:13.270 --> 07:15:13.280 align:start position:0%
representative ghouls for a question
 
07:15:15.750 --> 07:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question and uh
 
07:15:16.708 --> 07:15:16.718 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:15:16.718 --> 07:15:18.948 align:start position:0%
thank you
uh

07:15:18.948 --> 07:15:18.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:21.590 --> 07:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh right now for example in merrimack
 
07:15:21.600 --> 07:15:23.110 align:start position:0%
uh right now for example in merrimack
there's

07:15:23.110 --> 07:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
there's
 
07:15:25.670 --> 07:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
an area where people have pieces and i
 
07:15:28.390 --> 07:15:28.400 align:start position:0%
was just tested and i'm on the edge of
 
07:15:30.708 --> 07:15:30.718 align:start position:0%
but they came into my area to test my
 
07:15:32.468 --> 07:15:32.478 align:start position:0%
well but
 
07:15:34.948 --> 07:15:34.958 align:start position:0%
way up all through the state
 
07:15:37.430 --> 07:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
is there pfas would every place have to
 
07:15:40.628 --> 07:15:40.638 align:start position:0%
be tested isn't there something like the
 
07:15:42.548 --> 07:15:42.558 align:start position:0%
merrimack situation in regard to the
 
07:15:44.070 --> 07:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
whole state
 
07:15:47.030 --> 07:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
in regard that the uh child care places
 
07:15:49.190 --> 07:15:49.200 align:start position:0%
could be affected or not affected you
 
07:15:50.390 --> 07:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
know what i mean
 
07:15:52.150 --> 07:15:52.160 align:start position:0%
no absolutely
 
07:15:53.830 --> 07:15:53.840 align:start position:0%
southern new hampshire certainly has a
 
07:15:55.910 --> 07:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
more substantial pfas problem than the
 
07:15:58.708 --> 07:15:58.718 align:start position:0%
rest of state but pfas is
 
07:16:00.070 --> 07:16:00.080 align:start position:0%
pretty much can be anywhere and the only
 
07:16:01.590 --> 07:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
way to know if you're drinking it or not
 
07:16:03.030 --> 07:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
is to test your water there's so many
 
07:16:05.030 --> 07:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
sources i know of a
 
07:16:06.948 --> 07:16:06.958 align:start position:0%
child care facility off top my head in
 
07:16:10.230 --> 07:16:10.240 align:start position:0%
moultonborough that um had exceedances
 
07:16:10.240 --> 07:16:11.190 align:start position:0%
moultonborough that um had exceedances
so

07:16:11.190 --> 07:16:11.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:16:12.708 --> 07:16:12.718 align:start position:0%
certainly you know we have in small
 
07:16:14.390 --> 07:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
towns like center harbor there's no
 
07:16:16.230 --> 07:16:16.240 align:start position:0%
obvious source there's a cluster of
 
07:16:17.830 --> 07:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
wells um so
 
07:16:19.830 --> 07:16:19.840 align:start position:0%
yeah it can be anywhere but
 
07:16:26.708 --> 07:16:26.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:30.548 --> 07:16:30.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:35.510 --> 07:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:38.070 --> 07:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
that is all of the
 
07:16:41.670 --> 07:16:41.680 align:start position:0%
cards i have on this bill
 
07:16:41.680 --> 07:16:42.788 align:start position:0%
cards i have on this bill
and

07:16:42.788 --> 07:16:42.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:16:44.150 --> 07:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
with that
 
07:16:46.468 --> 07:16:46.478 align:start position:0%
i will
 
07:16:48.390 --> 07:16:48.400 align:start position:0%
so hb
 
07:16:53.110 --> 07:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
hearing on hb 1602 fn
 
07:16:56.230 --> 07:16:56.240 align:start position:0%
is cl is closed
 
07:16:58.310 --> 07:16:58.320 align:start position:0%

we to let you know we will we we have
 
07:17:05.920 --> 07:17:07.190 align:start position:0%
we to let you know we will we we have
another

07:17:07.190 --> 07:17:07.200 align:start position:0%
another
 
07:17:09.750 --> 07:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
hearing next week same same bat time
 
07:17:11.350 --> 07:17:11.360 align:start position:0%
same bat channel
 
07:17:11.360 --> 07:17:12.468 align:start position:0%
same bat channel
uh

07:17:12.468 --> 07:17:12.478 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:17:12.478 --> 07:17:13.990 align:start position:0%
uh
we

07:17:13.990 --> 07:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
we
 
07:17:17.110 --> 07:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
uh the hearing after that we will be
 
07:17:17.120 --> 07:17:20.070 align:start position:0%
uh the hearing after that we will be
doing

07:17:20.070 --> 07:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:23.030 --> 07:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
after that we will be doing the uh
 
07:17:26.708 --> 07:17:26.718 align:start position:0%
we'll start doing some exacting
 
07:17:28.548 --> 07:17:28.558 align:start position:0%
i'll put that out
 
07:17:30.310 --> 07:17:30.320 align:start position:0%
which means
 
07:17:34.070 --> 07:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
before exec there will be caucuses so uh
 
07:17:35.910 --> 07:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
republicans will get caught we'll be
 
07:17:37.830 --> 07:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
caucusing eventually
 
07:17:39.830 --> 07:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
at some point in time before
 
07:17:41.190 --> 07:17:41.200 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
07:17:45.270 --> 07:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:47.110 --> 07:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
and i presume the democrats will be
 
07:17:48.868 --> 07:17:48.878 align:start position:0%
doing the same yeah so mr chair you're
 
07:17:50.708 --> 07:17:50.718 align:start position:0%
thinking we'll start the executive 10 so
 
07:17:54.070 --> 07:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
we can caucus at nine and not uh we we
 
07:17:55.510 --> 07:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
could do that
 
07:17:57.590 --> 07:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
if that uh
 
07:17:59.670 --> 07:17:59.680 align:start position:0%
uh if
 
07:18:03.110 --> 07:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
yes we can we will caucus at 10 if
 
07:18:04.948 --> 07:18:04.958 align:start position:0%
unless we do have sight unless you want
 
07:18:06.708 --> 07:18:06.718 align:start position:0%
to do with something earlier with uh
 
07:18:06.718 --> 07:18:08.388 align:start position:0%
to do with something earlier with uh
republicans

07:18:08.388 --> 07:18:08.398 align:start position:0%
republicans
 
07:18:10.708 --> 07:18:10.718 align:start position:0%
we will have we will have a
 
07:18:12.628 --> 07:18:12.638 align:start position:0%
a caucus at nine
 
07:18:15.270 --> 07:18:15.280 align:start position:0%

07:18:16.628 --> 07:18:16.638 align:start position:0%
before then
 
07:18:18.070 --> 07:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
