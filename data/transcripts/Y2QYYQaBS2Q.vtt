uh it being uh 1005 uh we're going to go
 
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 align:start position:0%
ahead and open this working group
 
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.190 align:start position:0%
ahead and open this working group
session

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 align:start position:0%
uh the first uh bill that we're going to
 
00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 align:start position:0%
hear is 1604
 
00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 align:start position:0%
uh for for those of you who have thought
 
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
you might want to stay through the day
 
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 align:start position:0%
i'll give you a little bit of a preview
 
00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 align:start position:0%
of coming attractions
 
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
because of the amendment there's two or
 
00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.069 align:start position:0%
because of the amendment there's two or
three

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 align:start position:0%
bills that no longer have a fiscal note
 
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 align:start position:0%
associated with them
 
00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.990 align:start position:0%
associated with them
and

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 align:start position:0%
because they no longer have a fiscal
 
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 align:start position:0%
note associated with them
 
00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 align:start position:0%
finance doesn't really have
 
00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 align:start position:0%
any jurisdiction
 
00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
and in talking to the clerk today
 
00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 align:start position:0%
there's a house rule i believe it's 31f
 
00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 align:start position:0%
that says that if we have no fiscal
 
00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 align:start position:0%
impact then we uh then the chair of
 
00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
finance should just communicate that
 
00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 align:start position:0%
uh we're returning the bills without
 
00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
action and then the clerk will read that
 
00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 align:start position:0%
on the house floor
 
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
and there won't need to be a re-vote
 
00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
because it's already been voted so
 
00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
so some of the bills are like that and
 
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 align:start position:0%
but most of them are not
 
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 align:start position:0%
so with that
 
00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
we'll start with
 
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.630 align:start position:0%
we'll start with
1604

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 align:start position:0%
1604
 
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.229 align:start position:0%
1604
representative

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 align:start position:0%
cushman was the prime sponsor and
 
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 align:start position:0%
although this is a working group
 
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 align:start position:0%
i i know that she's
 
00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 align:start position:0%
thoughtfully prepared an amendment and
 
00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:40.879 align:start position:0%
i'd i'd like to give her an opportunity
 
00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 align:start position:0%
for the clerk just state your name and
 
00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:52.070 align:start position:0%
for the clerk just state your name and
all

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 align:start position:0%
my name is leah cushman i represent ware
 
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
and deering in hillsborough district 2.
 
00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
i have an amendment here that eliminates
 
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 align:start position:0%
the conscientious object
 
00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.190 align:start position:0%
the conscientious object
exemption

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.949 align:start position:0%
exemption
and

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 align:start position:0%
just leaves religious exemption with a
 
00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
simple statement and i think that'll
 
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 align:start position:0%
alleviate as much as i believe that we
 
00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.630 align:start position:0%
alleviate as much as i believe that we
should

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 align:start position:0%
should
 
00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
fight the federal government on this
 
00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
and you know protect the rights of our
 
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
health care workers
 
00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
state health care workers i
 
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 align:start position:0%
i believe this will do
 
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 align:start position:0%
what i wanted the bill to do really
 
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 align:start position:0%
besides for a very small number of
 
00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.830 align:start position:0%
besides for a very small number of
people

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
so if you have copies of your amendment
 
00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:42.159 align:start position:0%
could you distribute them and then while
 
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
that's happening
 
00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
i'll ask you if um
 
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 align:start position:0%
if if your amendment and if you don't
 
00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
know i might ask mr ripple for his
 
00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 align:start position:0%
interpretation uh if your amendment
 
00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.550 align:start position:0%
interpretation uh if your amendment
uh

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.429 align:start position:0%
uh
is

00:03:57.429 --> 00:03:57.439 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 align:start position:0%
i i think the effect of your amendment
 
00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 align:start position:0%
is it deletes
 
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 align:start position:0%
a medical exemption
 
00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:03.990 align:start position:0%
a medical exemption
altogether

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
altogether
 
00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:06.319 align:start position:0%
and i don't think that's your intent i
 
00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:08.159 align:start position:0%
just don't want to accidentally make a
 
00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 align:start position:0%
mistake with the way the amendment is
 
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:10.949 align:start position:0%
mistake with the way the amendment is
phrased

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 align:start position:0%
phrased
 
00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:04:15.429 --> 00:04:15.439 align:start position:0%
it doesn't delete so under the rule it
 
00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 align:start position:0%
would just default to whatever cms's
 
00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
rule is regarding medical exemptions it
 
00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't mention it at all it just
 
00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:22.390 align:start position:0%
doesn't mention it at all it just
mentions

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
mentions
 
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
that for religious exemptions they have
 
00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
to just accept a simple statement and
 
00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 align:start position:0%
the whole reason is that these have
 
00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 align:start position:0%
turned into religious inquisition so
 
00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
that's what we're trying to avoid by
 
00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 align:start position:0%
allowing a simple statement to be
 
00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:37.110 align:start position:0%
allowing a simple statement to be
granted

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 align:start position:0%
granted
 
00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
right i i would avoid the term religious
 
00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 align:start position:0%
inquisition and just simply say that
 
00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.150 align:start position:0%
inquisition and just simply say that
employers

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
employers
 
00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:46.479 align:start position:0%
are not set up in their hr departments
 
00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.040 align:start position:0%
to have somebody qualified to evaluate
 
00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
another individual's religious beliefs
 
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
and because they lack the qualification
 
00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't have the authority to
 
00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 align:start position:0%
have an opinion on somebody else's
 
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
religious beliefs so i like i like what
 
00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 align:start position:0%
you've done with the religious amendment
 
00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:03.919 align:start position:0%
part of this
 
00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.590 align:start position:0%
um and
um

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 align:start position:0%
i i just want to make sure that we don't
 
00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
inadvertently remove the medical
 
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.350 align:start position:0%
inadvertently remove the medical
exemption

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 align:start position:0%
and so mr ripple is
 
00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 align:start position:0%
very busy um
 
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
so mr ripple while you were doing that
 
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
did you did you hear what i was saying
 
00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:39.199 align:start position:0%
about i i i like the religious exemption
 
00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 align:start position:0%
part of representative cushman's
 
00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:43.039 align:start position:0%
amendment but i
 
00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
but in the other amendment that she
 
00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:48.320 align:start position:0%
drafted on my behalf or had drafted on
 
00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:50.639 align:start position:0%
my behalf we talked to the medical
 
00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:53.199 align:start position:0%
exemption part and
 
00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
i get representative cushman's point
 
00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
that there's too much in this
 
00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:00.639 align:start position:0%
because if cms changes their rules then
 
00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
our law is out of sync and so it should
 
00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
just basically be referring to the cms
 
00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.390 align:start position:0%
just basically be referring to the cms
somehow

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
somehow
 
00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:10.479 align:start position:0%
so what what what are your thoughts if
 
00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:17.039 align:start position:0%
her language only deals
 
00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:18.390 align:start position:0%
her language only deals
with

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:06:21.749 --> 00:06:21.759 align:start position:0%
the religious um uh exemption part does
 
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
do you think it inadvertently
 
00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.510 align:start position:0%
do you think it inadvertently
removes

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
removes
 
00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
the medical and then
 
00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.029 align:start position:0%
the medical and then
similarly

00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:29.039 align:start position:0%
similarly
 
00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:32.800 align:start position:0%
uh does it also delete the con
 
00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
conscience or conscientious
 
00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:36.800 align:start position:0%
uh exemption because that should be
 
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
deleted um it does delete both of those
 
00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
leaving only the religious exemption i
 
00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
think if you wanted to include a medical
 
00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:44.720 align:start position:0%
exemption but without as much detail as
 
00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
in your amendment you could probably
 
00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
add medical back with some general
 
00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:51.919 align:start position:0%
reference to as defined by the centers
 
00:06:53.589 --> 00:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
for medicare and medicaid services and
 
00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
so that way if their definition or their
 
00:06:57.029 --> 00:06:57.039 align:start position:0%
requirements changed it would still be
 
00:06:59.270 --> 00:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
included in state law
 
00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
all right that sounds rational would you
 
00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
would you
 
00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:05.919 align:start position:0%
be bothered if we amended your amendment
 
00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
not at all nope that sounds that sounds
 
00:07:10.309 --> 00:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
like it makes sense to me okay we have a
 
00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:15.589 --> 00:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
i think that's representative kenner can
 
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:17.120 align:start position:0%
hear but that's okay
 
00:07:19.029 --> 00:07:19.039 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i'm just joking i'm just
 
00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:19.909 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i'm just joking i'm just
joking

00:07:19.909 --> 00:07:19.919 align:start position:0%
joking
 
00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
but um yeah i think it's important that
 
00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:22.790 align:start position:0%
but um yeah i think it's important that
we

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:24.800 align:start position:0%
not take out the medical exemption
 
00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:25.919 align:start position:0%
because that's actually one of the most
 
00:07:27.909 --> 00:07:27.919 align:start position:0%
important exemptions that's there the
 
00:07:29.189 --> 00:07:29.199 align:start position:0%
important part and i'll just distribute
 
00:07:31.189 --> 00:07:31.199 align:start position:0%
this is the requirements for the
 
00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:33.440 align:start position:0%
exemptions are set by the federal
 
00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
government by cms and we have to follow
 
00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
those the supremacy clause states that
 
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:38.950 align:start position:0%
those the supremacy clause states that
clearly

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
clearly
 
00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:41.120 align:start position:0%
and they have reiterated that we must
 
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
follow their requirements not the states
 
00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
can't make their own rules for it
 
00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
and my colleague representative cushman
 
00:07:49.029 --> 00:07:49.039 align:start position:0%
knows that she and i thought about the
 
00:07:50.629 --> 00:07:50.639 align:start position:0%
conscientious thing and i appreciate you
 
00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
taking that out
 
00:07:54.629 --> 00:07:54.639 align:start position:0%
the other issue
 
00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
um is could we just do one at a time
 
00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:58.309 align:start position:0%
um is could we just do one at a time
because

00:07:58.309 --> 00:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
one issue at a time yeah i mean well
 
00:08:03.029 --> 00:08:03.039 align:start position:0%
it's back to the medical um so i don't
 
00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:05.360 align:start position:0%
think i think we somehow need to still
 
00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that we want to make sure
 
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
that that doesn't disappear and i do
 
00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
agree it needs to just default to their
 
00:08:13.029 --> 00:08:13.039 align:start position:0%
rules if we can't start putting it into
 
00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
statute what the rules ought to be
 
00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
because those could change
 
00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
so let me ask you a question about it
 
00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:23.360 align:start position:0%
please um in the cms guidelines do they
 
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
have criteria for how a religious
 
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:42.709 align:start position:0%
 
because

00:08:42.709 --> 00:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:42.719 --> 00:08:43.829 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:08:43.829 --> 00:08:43.839 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
the right side column it lists the
 
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
religious exemption
 
00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:50.240 align:start position:0%
uh all right so
 
00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.030 align:start position:0%
uh all right so
um

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:57.200 align:start position:0%
i'll get to you in just a second
 
00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
representative rogers so so just for the
 
00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
audience following this uh the
 
00:09:03.829 --> 00:09:03.839 align:start position:0%
requirements for the basics for a
 
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
religious exemption is
 
00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
facilities must develop a process for
 
00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
permitting staff to request a religious
 
00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
exemption on that criteria i think
 
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
representative cushman's religious
 
00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
and then the second one is facilities
 
00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
must ensure
 
00:09:25.269 --> 00:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
all requests for religious exemptions
 
00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
are documented and evaluated in
 
00:09:29.509 --> 00:09:29.519 align:start position:0%
accordance with applicable law and as
 
00:09:31.829 --> 00:09:31.839 align:start position:0%
part of the facility's policies and
 
00:09:31.839 --> 00:09:33.350 align:start position:0%
part of the facility's policies and
procedures

00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
procedures
 
00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
i don't know all of the federal law in
 
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
this space when i did my homework uh
 
00:09:39.509 --> 00:09:39.519 align:start position:0%
over the weekend
 
00:09:39.519 --> 00:09:41.350 align:start position:0%
over the weekend
um

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:41.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:44.720 align:start position:0%
i didn't get anyone pushing back on me
 
00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:45.829 align:start position:0%
i didn't get anyone pushing back on me
that

00:09:45.829 --> 00:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
the cushman statement would conflict
 
00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
yeah that was actually my second concern
 
00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
and that is it just says that if you
 
00:09:59.430 --> 00:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
write it it's automatically requested if
 
00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
you request it
 
00:10:02.949 --> 00:10:02.959 align:start position:0%
this the cms rules do say that the
 
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
facility must ensure that they're
 
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
documented and evaluated and that still
 
00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:10.480 align:start position:0%
remains in conflict
 
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
if the if they're evaluated
 
00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
and they're directed to
 
00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
shall accept but i i don't know i i'm
 
00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
enough of a word weasel that i would say
 
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:23.200 align:start position:0%
that would qualify as an evaluation i've
 
00:10:25.509 --> 00:10:25.519 align:start position:0%
received documentation it's properly
 
00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
filled out i know who the employee is
 
00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
uh so i've evaluated that this is a good
 
00:10:33.509 --> 00:10:33.519 align:start position:0%
and accurate document and we're
 
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
accepting it so so i think under the
 
00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:40.399 align:start position:0%
word evaluation this would qualify uh go
 
00:10:40.399 --> 00:10:41.670 align:start position:0%
word evaluation this would qualify uh go
ahead

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:41.680 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
00:10:44.069 --> 00:10:44.079 align:start position:0%
i would respectfully disagree documented
 
00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
is exactly what you said we have a form
 
00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
we know the person is that's a
 
00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
documentation evaluated means you look
 
00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:51.200 align:start position:0%
at is it been a clear and consistent
 
00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:53.200 align:start position:0%
belief or just what they usually try to
 
00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.230 align:start position:0%
belief or just what they usually try to
apply

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:54.240 align:start position:0%
apply
 
00:10:55.829 --> 00:10:55.839 align:start position:0%
or just like any other aspect of
 
00:10:57.269 --> 00:10:57.279 align:start position:0%
evaluation that means actually looking
 
00:10:58.949 --> 00:10:58.959 align:start position:0%
at it and critically analyzing whether
 
00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
it is accurate or not that's evaluation
 
00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:04.160 align:start position:0%
documentation is just the piece of paper
 
00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
so it's that second part of the word in
 
00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
the cms rules and evaluated in
 
00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:10.079 align:start position:0%
accordance if applicable federal law
 
00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
that i think
 
00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
i think we just need to default to the
 
00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:14.720 align:start position:0%
federal law just as we would for for
 
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
medical we should default to the
 
00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
the federal law or regulation i'm sorry
 
00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:23.200 align:start position:0%
uh for the religious as well
 
00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:26.720 align:start position:0%
so we have a difference of opinion and
 
00:11:28.069 --> 00:11:28.079 align:start position:0%
i'll come to you in just a second
 
00:11:30.069 --> 00:11:30.079 align:start position:0%
representative rogers uh
 
00:11:30.079 --> 00:11:31.350 align:start position:0%
representative rogers uh
um

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:33.680 align:start position:0%
we have a difference of opinion i if if
 
00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
we're allowed
 
00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
i i just firmly believe that there's no
 
00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
one in an employer
 
00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:41.190 align:start position:0%
one in an employer
situation

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:41.200 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
that is qualified to evaluate another
 
00:11:46.949 --> 00:11:46.959 align:start position:0%
individual's religious beliefs
 
00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
and because they lack qualification i
 
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.190 align:start position:0%
and because they lack qualification i
cannot

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
cannot
 
00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
in good conscience
 
00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
delegate to them the authority of ruling
 
00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:57.590 align:start position:0%
delegate to them the authority of ruling
on

00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:11:59.350 --> 00:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
uh whether or not somebody's religious
 
00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
beliefs are sufficient for for them
 
00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:03.910 align:start position:0%
beliefs are sufficient for for them
so

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:06.240 align:start position:0%
so uh that's kind of where i am
 
00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:12.949 --> 00:12:12.959 align:start position:0%
yeah um representative knark is is new
 
00:12:14.629 --> 00:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
to sitting in here so
 
00:12:16.389 --> 00:12:16.399 align:start position:0%
he might not be familiar with it but my
 
00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
understanding is that these bills have
 
00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
passed the policy committee they've
 
00:12:23.829 --> 00:12:23.839 align:start position:0%
passed the floor on policy and we are
 
00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
the second committee but we're supposed
 
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:28.160 align:start position:0%
to be looking at the financial end of it
 
00:12:32.069 --> 00:12:32.079 align:start position:0%
only and not redoing the policy
 
00:12:34.069 --> 00:12:34.079 align:start position:0%
one of the biggest complaints that many
 
00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
people have traditionally always had is
 
00:12:40.629 --> 00:12:40.639 align:start position:0%
when finance sticks its nose into policy
 
00:12:43.269 --> 00:12:43.279 align:start position:0%
after it's been decided not only by the
 
00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
committee but by a vote on the floor so
 
00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:48.160 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm concerned as to why
 
00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
we are re-debating policy and not just
 
00:12:54.069 --> 00:12:54.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:56.389 --> 00:12:56.399 align:start position:0%
um the reason for that
 
00:12:58.870 --> 00:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
is and that's you have a very fair point
 
00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:01.200 align:start position:0%
and i but i think what we're
 
00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
trying to deal with
 
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
is that uh as currently written 1604
 
00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:09.200 align:start position:0%
puts some of the federal funding at risk
 
00:13:11.269 --> 00:13:11.279 align:start position:0%
and so we want to shave off anything
 
00:13:13.829 --> 00:13:13.839 align:start position:0%
that would create the risk
 
00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
while still
 
00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
having a
 
00:13:18.949 --> 00:13:18.959 align:start position:0%
strong statement
 
00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
on the part of the state of new
 
00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.069 align:start position:0%
on the part of the state of new
hampshire

00:13:22.069 --> 00:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
and and representative cushman as the
 
00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
primary sponsor is is is in a fairly
 
00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
good position to to represent what what
 
00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
we've done already on the policy side so
 
00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
follow up i just i'm very concerned that
 
00:13:39.829 --> 00:13:39.839 align:start position:0%
we're we're delving very dangerously
 
00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
close to re-debating policy that's been
 
00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
debated um representative knuck just
 
00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
just referred to it um disagreement that
 
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:50.240 align:start position:0%
he had with representative cushman in
 
00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
the policy committee and if the policy
 
00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
committee decided one way i understand
 
00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
what you're saying if it has
 
00:13:58.389 --> 00:13:58.399 align:start position:0%
a loss of federal funds but i think
 
00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
we're dangerously close and we need to
 
00:14:03.189 --> 00:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
be very careful not to cross that line
 
00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
00:14:07.829 --> 00:14:07.839 align:start position:0%
so i don't
 
00:14:07.839 --> 00:14:09.030 align:start position:0%
so i don't
i

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
i understand your point i i don't i
 
00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't apply the word dangerous to
 
00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:15.760 align:start position:0%
what we're doing uh we're having a
 
00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
conversation so
 
00:14:20.389 --> 00:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
what i what i would like to do
 
00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
on this mr ripple is is if you could
 
00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:24.790 align:start position:0%
on this mr ripple is is if you could
take

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
take
 
00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
the cushman amendment
 
00:14:28.069 --> 00:14:28.079 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:14:30.949 --> 00:14:30.959 align:start position:0%
make sure that we have sufficient
 
00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
wording in the in a new draft of the
 
00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
amendment so that we don't accidentally
 
00:14:38.629 --> 00:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
leave out the medical exemption
 
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
and it would be great is there anyone in
 
00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
the room who's qualified to talk about
 
00:14:45.829 --> 00:14:45.839 align:start position:0%
the full body of federal law relative to
 
00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
religious exemptions
 
00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't think there is
 
00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:51.990 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't think there is
um

00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
and then since we're going to end up
 
00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:56.240 align:start position:0%
having to talk about this on the 21st
 
00:14:59.189 --> 00:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
because we'll look at the amendment then
 
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
um if if we could um shake the tree of
 
00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
of the state a little bit see if we
 
00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
could get an opinion on the whether or
 
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
not the religious exemption as written
 
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
in the amendment if that would conflict
 
00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:18.629 --> 00:15:18.639 align:start position:0%
is that is that okay yup sure i can try
 
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:22.170 align:start position:0%
all right so represent wallner
 
00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:23.590 align:start position:0%
all right so represent wallner

a question for you do we have someone in

the room who can talk to us about the
 
00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh all right um
 
00:15:40.389 --> 00:15:40.399 align:start position:0%
is there anyone in the audience
 
00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
that wants to talk about the potential
 
00:15:45.189 --> 00:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
loss of cms funding if if we do these
 
00:15:48.069 --> 00:15:48.079 align:start position:0%
exemptions wrong
 
00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:50.720 align:start position:0%

c-a-r-i-s-t-i
 
00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:16:21.829 --> 00:16:21.839 align:start position:0%
if you could since you're steeped in
 
00:16:21.839 --> 00:16:22.710 align:start position:0%
if you could since you're steeped in
this

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:22.720 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:24.389 align:start position:0%
this
um

00:16:24.389 --> 00:16:24.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
what what we
 
00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
what i want the finance committee to do
 
00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
is to avoid
 
00:16:33.509 --> 00:16:33.519 align:start position:0%
running into a conflict with with
 
00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:37.360 align:start position:0%
federal law or cms rules
 
00:16:39.829 --> 00:16:39.839 align:start position:0%
nevertheless i would like to
 
00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
have a path along that boundary
 
00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:44.639 align:start position:0%
to where
 
00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
we're not delegating to an employer
 
00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
the the duty
 
00:16:53.749 --> 00:16:53.759 align:start position:0%
to evaluate somebody's religious beliefs
 
00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
that's just outside of their purview um
 
00:16:58.870 --> 00:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
so so could you
 
00:17:00.949 --> 00:17:00.959 align:start position:0%
uh i don't know if you've considered
 
00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
this amendment yet
 
00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
but if you were to just look at
 
00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:07.029 align:start position:0%
but if you were to just look at
um

00:17:07.029 --> 00:17:07.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
where did i put representative cushman's
 
00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:11.590 align:start position:0%
where did i put representative cushman's
amendment

00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
if if you could just read from like line
 
00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:19.839 align:start position:0%
5 down to 12 of amendment 108.2 do you
 
00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:21.839 align:start position:0%
have that
 
00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
i do yep okay uh i'll give you like a
 
00:17:26.949 --> 00:17:26.959 align:start position:0%
minute to really look at it and think
 
00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
about it
 
00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:30.559 align:start position:0%
yeah i've actually i was reading it in
 
00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
the in the back of the room
 
00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:36.160 align:start position:0%
i think and for the religious exemptions
 
00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:17:39.669 --> 00:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
the guidance that representative knight
 
00:17:41.909 --> 00:17:41.919 align:start position:0%
provided is actually
 
00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
fairly consistent with what we've seen
 
00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
from the guidance that we've received as
 
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
a facility there's not a lot of detail
 
00:17:49.909 --> 00:17:49.919 align:start position:0%
in the cms rules relative to the
 
00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
religious exemption process
 
00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
i think i i do share that same kind of
 
00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
thought that representative khanurkh had
 
00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:58.310 align:start position:0%
thought that representative khanurkh had
that

00:17:58.310 --> 00:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:17:59.430 --> 00:17:59.440 align:start position:0%
there does need to be some sort of
 
00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
evaluation process but cms doesn't
 
00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
define what that process is
 
00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
so in that regard i'm unsure um
 
00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
and i don't think there's guidance out
 
00:18:09.909 --> 00:18:09.919 align:start position:0%
there that would answer that question
 
00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
one way or the other right now
 
00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
so if um if our if the state of new
 
00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:16.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire took the position that the
 
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
evaluation was satisfied
 
00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
uh by the employer's receipt of the
 
00:18:23.669 --> 00:18:23.679 align:start position:0%
documentation and validation that it
 
00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:24.720 align:start position:0%
came from
 
00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
one of their employees and was submitted
 
00:18:29.669 --> 00:18:29.679 align:start position:0%
in accordance with their process
 
00:18:29.679 --> 00:18:30.470 align:start position:0%
in accordance with their process
that

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
to me is an evaluation of yes we have
 
00:18:35.669 --> 00:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
good documentation
 
00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
and therefore the word evaluation would
 
00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:39.510 align:start position:0%
be satisfied do you
 
00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:40.630 align:start position:0%
be satisfied do you
[Music]

00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:40.640 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
do you believe that to just be a bad
 
00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
interpretation or just a different
 
00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:47.510 align:start position:0%
interpretation or just a different
interpretation

00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
interpretation
 
00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
i think i just don't know um there's not
 
00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
enough guidance that supports that
 
00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
argument one way or the other from what
 
00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
i've seen
 
00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:55.750 align:start position:0%
i've seen
okay

00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:18:58.390 --> 00:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
great uh so we've got an amendment that
 
00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
we'll look at on monday the 21st and if
 
00:19:04.549 --> 00:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't mind
 
00:19:06.789 --> 00:19:06.799 align:start position:0%
delving into that and then mr ripple if
 
00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:09.440 align:start position:0%
you could find whoever is our expert on
 
00:19:11.909 --> 00:19:11.919 align:start position:0%
federal law on this it'd be great to get
 
00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
an opinion
 
00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:14.789 align:start position:0%
an opinion
okay

00:19:14.789 --> 00:19:14.799 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:16.720 align:start position:0%
uh there's another
 
00:19:19.029 --> 00:19:19.039 align:start position:0%

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
representative walner
 
00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:28.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
do you think the way the bill is written
 
00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
now the way it came from health and
 
00:19:34.789 --> 00:19:34.799 align:start position:0%
human services does it still put us in
 
00:19:37.669 --> 00:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
jeopardy of losing
 
00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
federal funds or
 
00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
what federal funds might be put in
 
00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.110 align:start position:0%
what federal funds might be put in
question

00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
as it came from the house or as this
 
00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:46.640 align:start position:0%
amendment would read
 
00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
oh well as it came from the house i'd
 
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
like to know that and then
 
00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:52.400 align:start position:0%
with the amendment
 
00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
as it came from the house yes i believe
 
00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:57.039 align:start position:0%
it would because it does include
 
00:19:59.430 --> 00:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
a conscience a conscientious
 
00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
exemption which is not allowed within
 
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
the cms
 
00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
guidance relative to the coven 19
 
00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
vaccine mandate um and then i believe
 
00:20:11.669 --> 00:20:11.679 align:start position:0%
the medical exemptions are um
 
00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
the amount of information required in in
 
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
the current house bill 1604 for a
 
00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
medical exemption is less than what cms
 
00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:21.750 align:start position:0%
medical exemption is less than what cms
requires

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
requires
 
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
all right a follow-up to that though is
 
00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
if we're taking out the conscientious uh
 
00:20:30.549 --> 00:20:30.559 align:start position:0%
exemption of just removing it and if
 
00:20:30.559 --> 00:20:31.350 align:start position:0%
exemption of just removing it and if
we're

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:31.360 align:start position:0%
we're
 
00:20:34.149 --> 00:20:34.159 align:start position:0%
leaving the medical uh with a with the
 
00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
right nub on it so that it hooks into
 
00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
whatever the cms guidelines are
 
00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
then that takes care of your two
 
00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
big rocks your two big concerns
 
00:20:49.029 --> 00:20:49.039 align:start position:0%
that is correct and then on the
 
00:20:51.029 --> 00:20:51.039 align:start position:0%
religious one i as i've said i just
 
00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
don't know um there's not enough enough
 
00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
guidance out there
 
00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:56.720 align:start position:0%
okay so we have a week to work on the
 
00:20:59.909 --> 00:20:59.919 align:start position:0%
don't know part so that's that's fine
 
00:20:59.919 --> 00:21:00.870 align:start position:0%
don't know part so that's that's fine
um

00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:02.549 --> 00:21:02.559 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions from the
 
00:21:02.559 --> 00:21:04.310 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions from the
committee

00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
is there anyone in the oh go ahead
 
00:21:09.029 --> 00:21:09.039 align:start position:0%
doctor excuse me i force a habit
 
00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
representative kenner
 
00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:14.320 align:start position:0%
yes i i appreciate the comments that
 
00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
were made but i think it and and i do
 
00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
appreciate that we are not supposed to
 
00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:19.280 align:start position:0%
discuss the policy but the
 
00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
impact fiscal impact is
 
00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
directly influenced by the policy that
 
00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
was generated by this which does place
 
00:21:28.789 --> 00:21:28.799 align:start position:0%
us in conflict the other piece is not
 
00:21:28.799 --> 00:21:29.590 align:start position:0%
us in conflict the other piece is not
just

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:31.280 align:start position:0%
the impact on the state
 
00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
but the impact on the counties and any
 
00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:36.400 align:start position:0%
other nursing homes that take medicaid
 
00:21:38.149 --> 00:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
uh reimbursement which is essentially
 
00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:40.240 align:start position:0%
almost all of them all
 
00:21:42.549 --> 00:21:42.559 align:start position:0%
five out of there's seven out of ninety
 
00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
private homes in the state that don't
 
00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
take medicaid but most do and all the
 
00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
county homes do
 
00:21:48.789 --> 00:21:48.799 align:start position:0%
because they will also face the same
 
00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
thing and the estimated amount of
 
00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:52.240 align:start position:0%
medicaid dollars that flow to this state
 
00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:54.400 align:start position:0%
just the federal share
 
00:21:56.149 --> 00:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
for just the nursing homes i think is
 
00:21:58.230 --> 00:21:58.240 align:start position:0%
around 200 million dollars so that would
 
00:22:00.149 --> 00:22:00.159 align:start position:0%
be in addition to the losses would occur
 
00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
with glenn cliff and the new hampshire
 
00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:05.360 align:start position:0%
hospital so it's a sizable risk of loss
 
00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:08.320 align:start position:0%
if we do not comply with the rules which
 
00:22:10.149 --> 00:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
as it comes out of the house it clearly
 
00:22:13.029 --> 00:22:13.039 align:start position:0%
does not comply with the rules
 
00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
so would you believe that we're in
 
00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
violent agreement that this committee
 
00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
will do nothing to put at risk the
 
00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
federal funding around cms
 
00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:23.440 align:start position:0%
i would hope so
 
00:22:24.549 --> 00:22:24.559 align:start position:0%
because i don't think we're prepared to
 
00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
backfill 200 million dollars uh no but i
 
00:22:30.149 --> 00:22:30.159 align:start position:0%
think we're being very careful to to not
 
00:22:32.789 --> 00:22:32.799 align:start position:0%
do that while recognizing that new
 
00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire has a different
 
00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
has its own perspective on how to
 
00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
employers should be evaluating religious
 
00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:41.830 align:start position:0%
employers should be evaluating religious
exemptions

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
exemptions
 
00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:43.360 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:54.789 --> 00:22:54.799 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman edwards my name is
 
00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:56.240 align:start position:0%
kate horgan i represent the new
 
00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire association of counties i just
 
00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to bring a line nine to the
 
00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
so it says employees contractors
 
00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
patients visitors or students
 
00:23:16.549 --> 00:23:16.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
so are you talking about line nine of
 
00:23:22.549 --> 00:23:22.559 align:start position:0%
the cushman amazon amendment all right
 
00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:24.640 align:start position:0%
i'm ready okay so we are only
 
00:23:27.029 --> 00:23:27.039 align:start position:0%
responsible for holding vaccine
 
00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
information for our employees
 
00:23:32.149 --> 00:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
not for visitors not for patients
 
00:23:33.909 --> 00:23:33.919 align:start position:0%
students i can kind of see because we
 
00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:36.640 align:start position:0%
have student nurses in but i would hate
 
00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
for this
 
00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:40.480 align:start position:0%
to require us to hold all that extra
 
00:23:43.269 --> 00:23:43.279 align:start position:0%
information if we don't need to so i
 
00:23:43.279 --> 00:23:44.070 align:start position:0%
information if we don't need to so i
think

00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
if you took out contractors patients and
 
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
visitors that would make it a better
 
00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
amendment because we aren't asking for
 
00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
that anyway
 
00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:56.240 align:start position:0%
it's not part of the cms requirement
 
00:23:58.230 --> 00:23:58.240 align:start position:0%
miss ripple do you have that
 
00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:00.400 align:start position:0%
all right so he's drafting the amendment
 
00:24:02.549 --> 00:24:02.559 align:start position:0%
i think that's a good guidance thank you
 
00:24:03.669 --> 00:24:03.679 align:start position:0%
very much
 
00:24:11.029 --> 00:24:11.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:14.549 --> 00:24:14.559 align:start position:0%
um okay last call
 
00:24:14.559 --> 00:24:16.870 align:start position:0%
um okay last call
representative

00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:20.710 align:start position:0%
representative
leon

00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i just wanted to
 
00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:24.320 align:start position:0%
highlight one point from that last
 
00:24:26.549 --> 00:24:26.559 align:start position:0%
statement it does not require the
 
00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:28.720 align:start position:0%
facilities to take those exemptions it
 
00:24:31.269 --> 00:24:31.279 align:start position:0%
says shall upon request
 
00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
i believe that this would be a
 
00:24:34.789 --> 00:24:34.799 align:start position:0%
protection should the rules change to
 
00:24:37.269 --> 00:24:37.279 align:start position:0%
include patients visitors or those
 
00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
students who are undergoing part of
 
00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
their clinical rotation
 
00:24:43.269 --> 00:24:43.279 align:start position:0%
so i would like to see if we can
 
00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:46.240 align:start position:0%
understand if that shall upon request
 
00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't put a burden unless
 
00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
these these requirements are placed upon
 
00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:59.590 --> 00:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
miss ripple did you write it down to
 
00:25:01.029 --> 00:25:01.039 align:start position:0%
where we're going to delete the
 
00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
reference to contractors patients and
 
00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
visitors and leave in students
 
00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
yes my initial thought was that you
 
00:25:11.909 --> 00:25:11.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
does that meet your uh your observation
 
00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
uh my observation is that it says um
 
00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
upon request and i'm not sure why they
 
00:25:22.149 --> 00:25:22.159 align:start position:0%
would need to request an exemption
 
00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:24.400 align:start position:0%
unless they were required to provide
 
00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
proof of vaccination um i i see that as
 
00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:30.390 align:start position:0%
proof of vaccination um i i see that as
um

00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
i just see that as something that isn't
 
00:25:36.789 --> 00:25:36.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:40.840 align:start position:0%
so the facilities are generally not
 
00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:42.710 align:start position:0%
so the facilities are generally not
attempting

00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
attempting
 
00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:45.440 align:start position:0%
i can clarify that sir all right
 
00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
um in the guidelines because again what
 
00:25:49.029 --> 00:25:49.039 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do is meet the
 
00:25:49.039 --> 00:25:50.310 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do is meet the
guidelines

00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:50.320 align:start position:0%
guidelines
 
00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:52.400 align:start position:0%
vaccination requirements apply to all
 
00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
eligible staff current and new working
 
00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:55.360 align:start position:0%
at a facility
 
00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:56.470 align:start position:0%
at a facility
including

00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
including
 
00:25:57.830 --> 00:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
facility employees licensed
 
00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:00.400 align:start position:0%
practitioners students
 
00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
trainees volunteers
 
00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:04.640 align:start position:0%
contracted staff so they those groups
 
00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
are included not visitors but those
 
00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
groups are included in the cms mandate
 
00:26:11.669 --> 00:26:11.679 align:start position:0%
so we should not be excluding them from
 
00:26:13.669 --> 00:26:13.679 align:start position:0%
this amendment if we're going to try to
 
00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
match i think we could also again just
 
00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
default to cms rules in this that might
 
00:26:19.909 --> 00:26:19.919 align:start position:0%
be safer in case
 
00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:21.200 align:start position:0%
and this is difficult with writing
 
00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
legislation we often just refer
 
00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
to a cfr or something like that
 
00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:27.029 align:start position:0%
to a cfr or something like that
where

00:26:27.029 --> 00:26:27.039 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:29.200 align:start position:0%
if it changes we still have the proper
 
00:26:32.149 --> 00:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
statutory reference or cfr reference
 
00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
here we're trying to parse it and if it
 
00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
changes then we could become out of
 
00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
compliance because the rules changed i
 
00:26:39.029 --> 00:26:39.039 align:start position:0%
don't know that they're going to change
 
00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
the rules
 
00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:41.750 align:start position:0%
the rules
but

00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:26:43.909 --> 00:26:43.919 align:start position:0%
that's an important piece
 
00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about these
 
00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
categories who are eligible to request a
 
00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
religious exemption can we just simply
 
00:26:58.230 --> 00:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
uh write that in a more generic way that
 
00:26:58.240 --> 00:26:59.269 align:start position:0%
uh write that in a more generic way that
anyone

00:26:59.269 --> 00:26:59.279 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
00:26:59.279 --> 00:27:01.029 align:start position:0%
anyone
that

00:27:01.029 --> 00:27:01.039 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
falls under the guidance of the cms
 
00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:05.990 align:start position:0%
falls under the guidance of the cms
guidelines

00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
guidelines
 
00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
would be covered
 
00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
i think you can do that i haven't seen
 
00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
the cms rule in question so i don't know
 
00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
how it currently reads but i don't see
 
00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
why you couldn't
 
00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
i can i can provide that if give me your
 
00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
email okay
 
00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
yeah i'll send you an email so you'll
 
00:27:23.669 --> 00:27:23.679 align:start position:0%
have you'll have mine
 
00:27:23.679 --> 00:27:24.470 align:start position:0%
have you'll have mine
okay

00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:27.360 align:start position:0%
so good good good feedback good input
 
00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
thank you do you have anything else um
 
00:27:35.909 --> 00:27:35.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:35.919 --> 00:27:36.789 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:27:36.789 --> 00:27:36.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:27:39.909 --> 00:27:39.919 align:start position:0%
uh last call on 1604 is there one anyone
 
00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
in the room that still has something uh
 
00:27:44.149 --> 00:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
represent representative kenner uh two
 
00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:46.480 align:start position:0%
things one the first one is simply what
 
00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
have we decided to do about the medical
 
00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
piece and the second one is you have
 
00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
this other amendment are we going to
 
00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:56.389 --> 00:27:56.399 align:start position:0%
um no i'm not going to introduce the
 
00:27:58.789 --> 00:27:58.799 align:start position:0%
other amendment um and and i
 
00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
i i think what we've done is we've
 
00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
directed mr ripple
 
00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
to use the cushman amendment as
 
00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
a platform and then to make sure
 
00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
that we have the proper reference to the
 
00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
cms rules on medical exemptions so that
 
00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
the amendment that we consider
 
00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
one week from today
 
00:28:21.669 --> 00:28:21.679 align:start position:0%
will will have
 
00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
everything that we need is the hope you
 
00:28:26.149 --> 00:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
know i think the simplest conclusion
 
00:28:27.909 --> 00:28:27.919 align:start position:0%
would be to still keep all of
 
00:28:30.149 --> 00:28:30.159 align:start position:0%
representative cushman's amendment which
 
00:28:30.159 --> 00:28:31.350 align:start position:0%
representative cushman's amendment which
starts

00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:31.360 align:start position:0%
starts
 
00:28:34.549 --> 00:28:34.559 align:start position:0%
but on line three just to simply sorry
 
00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
sorry line eight just to simply say the
 
00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
rule shall default to the cms guidelines
 
00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:44.240 align:start position:0%
period because also this is written not
 
00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
just for this current
 
00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
uh guideline but it's subject to a valid
 
00:28:52.389 --> 00:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
and in line seven a valid and
 
00:28:54.149 --> 00:28:54.159 align:start position:0%
enforceable medicare medicaid condition
 
00:28:56.149 --> 00:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
of participation there may be something
 
00:28:58.549 --> 00:28:58.559 align:start position:0%
that comes down the pike later and our
 
00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
legislature our statutes need to be
 
00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
flexible and nimble to anticipate other
 
00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:05.440 align:start position:0%
things and not be always focused on for
 
00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
example in this case just covered 19
 
00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:07.990 align:start position:0%
example in this case just covered 19
stuff

00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
00:29:10.549 --> 00:29:10.559 align:start position:0%
so to make it nimble if we just say
 
00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
um you know anything that comes down the
 
00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:15.200 align:start position:0%
line is versus lines seven and eight and
 
00:29:17.269 --> 00:29:17.279 align:start position:0%
it says rules shall default to the cms
 
00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
rules period we don't have to do a whole
 
00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
lot of parsing it's done
 
00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:29.200 align:start position:0%
i think we have an obligation to protect
 
00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
the rights of new hampshire citizens and
 
00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
i i i want there to be clarity that the
 
00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
new hampshire position is is
 
00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
is what it is and that is
 
00:29:42.549 --> 00:29:42.559 align:start position:0%
employers are simply not qualified to
 
00:29:44.789 --> 00:29:44.799 align:start position:0%
evaluate a religious exemption and
 
00:29:44.799 --> 00:29:46.470 align:start position:0%
evaluate a religious exemption and
therefore

00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:46.480 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
00:29:49.269 --> 00:29:49.279 align:start position:0%
the best i think they should do or the
 
00:29:50.789 --> 00:29:50.799 align:start position:0%
most they should do
 
00:29:53.669 --> 00:29:53.679 align:start position:0%
is to properly process the paperwork
 
00:29:55.909 --> 00:29:55.919 align:start position:0%
and if they need to internally reassign
 
00:29:59.029 --> 00:29:59.039 align:start position:0%
someone because of their concerns about
 
00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
a possible transmission of infection
 
00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
they can do that but i i don't want them
 
00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:06.510 align:start position:0%
they can do that but i i don't want them
about

00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:06.520 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
evaluating uh somebody's personally held
 
00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:12.240 align:start position:0%
religious belief so so i think that's
 
00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:13.840 align:start position:0%
the amendment we're going to see next
 
00:30:15.669 --> 00:30:15.679 align:start position:0%
week and uh
 
00:30:17.269 --> 00:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
and then we can have another discussion
 
00:30:21.669 --> 00:30:21.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:23.669 --> 00:30:23.679 align:start position:0%
your mic is still on just
 
00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
just a warrant just to warn you people
 
00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
have said things with mike's hot mic so
 
00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:33.200 align:start position:0%
oh okay last call on 1604
 
00:30:37.029 --> 00:30:37.039 align:start position:0%
that closes 1604 uh the next bill up
 
00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:38.480 align:start position:0%
will be
 
00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:40.870 align:start position:0%
will be
1608.

00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
1608.
 
00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
uh representative prout said he might be
 
00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
here is there anyone standing in for
 
00:30:50.789 --> 00:30:50.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
is that you represent leon
 
00:30:56.710 --> 00:30:56.720 align:start position:0%
okay and and before i get you too fired
 
00:30:59.190 --> 00:30:59.200 align:start position:0%
up i want to consult with mr ripple is
 
00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
this one of the
 
00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
bills that has no fiscal impact now yes
 
00:31:05.909 --> 00:31:05.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:09.269 --> 00:31:09.279 align:start position:0%
okay so uh i got you you're moving for
 
00:31:11.669 --> 00:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
no reason because if there's no fiscal
 
00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
impact um
 
00:31:15.669 --> 00:31:15.679 align:start position:0%
i i would like the committee
 
00:31:15.679 --> 00:31:16.549 align:start position:0%
i i would like the committee
to

00:31:16.549 --> 00:31:16.559 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
pass us back to the finance committee
 
00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:19.990 align:start position:0%
pass us back to the finance committee
and

00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:22.720 align:start position:0%
recommended the chair that she informed
 
00:31:24.789 --> 00:31:24.799 align:start position:0%
the clerk that we you know we don't have
 
00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction under rule 41f we should be
 
00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:28.630 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction under rule 41f we should be
returning

00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:28.640 align:start position:0%
returning
 
00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
this without action from the finance
 
00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:31.430 align:start position:0%
this without action from the finance
committee

00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
do you have a problem with that i have
 
00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
no problem with that representative
 
00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
connerk and representative walner
 
00:31:40.389 --> 00:31:40.399 align:start position:0%
i disagree about no fiscal impact it's
 
00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
vastly diminished
 
00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
because the initial thing had this
 
00:31:46.549 --> 00:31:46.559 align:start position:0%
massive amount of contact campaigns with
 
00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:48.480 align:start position:0%
mail and emails and all kinds of things
 
00:31:50.549 --> 00:31:50.559 align:start position:0%
and that led to the very large
 
00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:52.720 align:start position:0%
fiscal responsibility
 
00:31:55.269 --> 00:31:55.279 align:start position:0%
the new the amendment massively
 
00:31:57.269 --> 00:31:57.279 align:start position:0%
decreases this because it just says the
 
00:31:58.630 --> 00:31:58.640 align:start position:0%
department shall execute a public
 
00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
information campaign to inform
 
00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
individuals that data was collected
 
00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
during that state of emergency
 
00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
that's vastly less and that's actually
 
00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
why we put this amendment in was to
 
00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:09.200 align:start position:0%
decrease the cost
 
00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:10.640 align:start position:0%
but i find it hard to believe the
 
00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
department's going to be able to do a
 
00:32:13.029 --> 00:32:13.039 align:start position:0%
massive public
 
00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
outreach campaign with no funds
 
00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
so this is one of the things where
 
00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
i rely on the lba to be the impartial
 
00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
unbiased umpire calling the balls and
 
00:32:26.149 --> 00:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
the strikes and so
 
00:32:29.269 --> 00:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
i'll just ask again of mr ripple who
 
00:32:32.789 --> 00:32:32.799 align:start position:0%
represents the unbiased lba
 
00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
is there a fiscal note now after the
 
00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
amendment or is there a determination of
 
00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
no fiscal impact there is a fiscal note
 
00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:41.360 align:start position:0%
but it reads that there's no fiscal
 
00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
impact and that was based on
 
00:32:45.909 --> 00:32:45.919 align:start position:0%
the response that we received from hhs
 
00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:48.320 align:start position:0%
and their position i believe was
 
00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:49.669 align:start position:0%
and their position i believe was
that

00:32:49.669 --> 00:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
they could accomplish the objectives of
 
00:32:53.269 --> 00:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
this bill within their existing budget
 
00:32:55.509 --> 00:32:55.519 align:start position:0%
which we typically reflect as no fiscal
 
00:32:55.519 --> 00:32:56.470 align:start position:0%
which we typically reflect as no fiscal
impact

00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
impact
 
00:32:58.149 --> 00:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
absolutely that's great i'm happy to
 
00:33:02.149 --> 00:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:04.789 --> 00:33:04.799 align:start position:0%
all right so can i interpret that to
 
00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:06.640 align:start position:0%
to mean that you're you're you're fine
 
00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
with us
 
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
re-referring this back to finance
 
00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
representative kenner oh yes if there's
 
00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
no if they can handle with the current
 
00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
budget then it's perfectly fine because
 
00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:16.880 align:start position:0%
we like the
 
00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:17.669 align:start position:0%
we like the
we

00:33:17.669 --> 00:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:33:19.669 --> 00:33:19.679 align:start position:0%
we were 19 to zero favoring the policy
 
00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
we just we were trying to cut the cost
 
00:33:23.029 --> 00:33:23.039 align:start position:0%
and it looks like we managed thank you
 
00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
uh representative erf did you have a
 
00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:25.990 align:start position:0%
uh representative erf did you have a
question

00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
well i'm just wondering why we can't
 
00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
refer back
 
00:33:30.789 --> 00:33:30.799 align:start position:0%
as otp because clearly
 
00:33:33.909 --> 00:33:33.919 align:start position:0%
the folks are not aware of this
 
00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
change i mean the change in the note i
 
00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
in other words the fact that it's no
 
00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:39.440 align:start position:0%
cost might change everybody's
 
00:33:41.029 --> 00:33:41.039 align:start position:0%
interpretation of how to look at this
 
00:33:41.039 --> 00:33:42.310 align:start position:0%
interpretation of how to look at this
bill

00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
so i might refer back with an otp not
 
00:33:49.669 --> 00:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:49.679 --> 00:33:50.470 align:start position:0%
 
if

00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:50.480 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:52.240 align:start position:0%
if the fiscal note says there's no
 
00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact
 
00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
based on my conversation with the clerk
 
00:33:59.110 --> 00:33:59.120 align:start position:0%
it's fairly clear that we should just
 
00:33:59.120 --> 00:33:59.909 align:start position:0%
it's fairly clear that we should just
have

00:33:59.909 --> 00:33:59.919 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:02.240 align:start position:0%
uh ask the chairman of the finance
 
00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:04.840 align:start position:0%
committee to send this
 
00:34:08.470 --> 00:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
back because there is no fiscal impact
 
00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:10.240 align:start position:0%
i understand what you're saying but we
 
00:34:13.829 --> 00:34:13.839 align:start position:0%
should clarify that that's a change
 
00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:16.240 align:start position:0%
from the way the bill was viewed when it
 
00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
passed the house because that
 
00:34:22.470 --> 00:34:22.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal note stating no impact
 
00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
was not available to the house when they
 
00:34:26.950 --> 00:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
considered the bill they were looking at
 
00:34:29.109 --> 00:34:29.119 align:start position:0%
eight million dollar cost which i agree
 
00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:34.629 --> 00:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
all right so i'm just trying to apply
 
00:34:36.869 --> 00:34:36.879 align:start position:0%
some common sense i think i learned in
 
00:34:39.349 --> 00:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
nebraska which is uh
 
00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
that if they approve this policy with an
 
00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:44.800 align:start position:0%
eight million dollar price tag
 
00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:47.200 align:start position:0%
they'll love it when it doesn't cost
 
00:34:49.669 --> 00:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
anything and given the number of bills
 
00:34:52.950 --> 00:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
that we have to hear and vote on before
 
00:34:56.470 --> 00:34:56.480 align:start position:0%
we we get everything to the senate i i'd
 
00:34:59.270 --> 00:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
keep that i'd rather keep this light
 
00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
representative walner
 
00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
i don't remember us using this process
 
00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
in the past
 
00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
where we
 
00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
if it if we determined it had no
 
00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
physical impact
 
00:35:17.589 --> 00:35:17.599 align:start position:0%
usually we proceeded on to
 
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
and ought to pass on the floor i mean
 
00:35:21.349 --> 00:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
that was usually the way we did it i
 
00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
don't remember this process
 
00:35:25.349 --> 00:35:25.359 align:start position:0%
so i just need to
 
00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
sort of refresh my
 
00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
memory of that with the clerk i don't
 
00:35:33.109 --> 00:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
maybe someone else who's been on on
 
00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
finance with me for
 
00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
in the past remembers how
 
00:35:40.069 --> 00:35:40.079 align:start position:0%
using that but i don't remember us using
 
00:35:41.829 --> 00:35:41.839 align:start position:0%
that in the past
 
00:35:45.109 --> 00:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
i i'd welcome you to talk to the clerk
 
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
my memory is horrible but i i just
 
00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
talked to him this morning okay and i
 
00:35:51.589 --> 00:35:51.599 align:start position:0%
think i can remember that long no i'm
 
00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
sure i'm sure that um
 
00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
that's what the clerk said i just didn't
 
00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
remember us
 
00:35:58.630 --> 00:35:58.640 align:start position:0%
years in the past
 
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
using that process and i trust your
 
00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
experience and background and and all
 
00:36:05.349 --> 00:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
this your judgment so so please do uh
 
00:36:05.359 --> 00:36:06.630 align:start position:0%
this your judgment so so please do uh
because

00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:06.640 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:08.240 align:start position:0%
we don't have to turn this back to the
 
00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
committee until next monday okay great
 
00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:12.640 align:start position:0%
thank you represent representative
 
00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:15.030 align:start position:0%
thank you represent representative
kenner

00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
kenner
 
00:36:17.349 --> 00:36:17.359 align:start position:0%
you got it um actually
 
00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
we did not happily approve this with an
 
00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:21.440 align:start position:0%
8 million expenditure that's why we
 
00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
amended it
 
00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
we amended it to get rid of that 8
 
00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
million expenditure that was the whole
 
00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
point of the amendment well not the
 
00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
whole point but a lot of it and as a
 
00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:31.280 align:start position:0%
historical point for this particular
 
00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
committee you'll appreciate that neil
 
00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:35.440 align:start position:0%
kirk came in actually to testify on this
 
00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
and um for the second time this year he
 
00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
and i had come up to the precise same
 
00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
conclusion on our own i had written my
 
00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
usual thing that i wrote on sunday
 
00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
before the hearing
 
00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
and that's precisely what he
 
00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
suggested which is very expensive we
 
00:36:50.069 --> 00:36:50.079 align:start position:0%
just need a public outreach thing and he
 
00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
and i came to the same conclusion the
 
00:36:53.829 --> 00:36:53.839 align:start position:0%
committee did as well and we did that to
 
00:36:59.670 --> 00:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:00.710 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:00.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
so i'm not sensing any opposition to us
 
00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
holding on to this while representative
 
00:37:07.829 --> 00:37:07.839 align:start position:0%
walner has an opportunity to talk to the
 
00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
clerk and we can revalidate um just
 
00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
passing this back to the finance chair
 
00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:17.349 --> 00:37:17.359 align:start position:0%
is that i see you saying yes yes thank
 
00:37:17.359 --> 00:37:19.670 align:start position:0%
is that i see you saying yes yes thank

00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:21.589 --> 00:37:21.599 align:start position:0%
uh is there any thank you is there any
 
00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
uh anyone in the room that wants to talk
 
00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
to 1608
 
00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:30.400 align:start position:0%
we'll close that
 
00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:31.589 align:start position:0%
we'll close that
or

00:37:31.589 --> 00:37:31.599 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:37:35.109 --> 00:37:35.119 align:start position:0%
postpone it again still for a week
 
00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:36.640 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:47.109 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:37:47.109 --> 00:37:47.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
this one
 
00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
ends up um there's an amendment
 
00:37:58.630 --> 00:37:58.640 align:start position:0%
if you look if you look at um
 
00:38:03.109 --> 00:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
the bill is amended with 0.0577
 
00:38:05.349 --> 00:38:05.359 align:start position:0%
which is the one that you had handed to
 
00:38:05.359 --> 00:38:06.390 align:start position:0%
which is the one that you had handed to
you

00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:38:07.589 --> 00:38:07.599 align:start position:0%
you'll see
 
00:38:12.069 --> 00:38:12.079 align:start position:0%
that this on line 20 of page 3
 
00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
cites the labor grade at
 
00:38:16.950 --> 00:38:16.960 align:start position:0%
as a 32
 
00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
with a sum of 254 000 appropriated
 
00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
as i understand that this has been
 
00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:26.560 align:start position:0%
getting reworked in the department
 
00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
and that labor grade
 
00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:31.280 align:start position:0%
went through an hr evaluation process
 
00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
and they determined it should be a grade
 
00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:34.710 align:start position:0%
and they determined it should be a grade
30

00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:34.720 align:start position:0%
30
 
00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:36.640 align:start position:0%
which drops
 
00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:40.720 align:start position:0%
the sum from 254 to 138
 
00:38:43.829 --> 00:38:43.839 align:start position:0%
000 or so it's a little less than that
 
00:38:43.839 --> 00:38:45.270 align:start position:0%
000 or so it's a little less than that
and

00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:45.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
and we end up picking up some federal
 
00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:50.720 align:start position:0%
money to help us pay for this is yet
 
00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:53.990 align:start position:0%
money to help us pay for this is yet
another

00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:58.230 --> 00:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
all right and so so we're going to look
 
00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:05.910 align:start position:0%
all right and so so we're going to look
at

00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:06.950 align:start position:0%
at
um

00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:09.589 --> 00:39:09.599 align:start position:0%
what mr ripple is now handing out uh
 
00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:13.680 align:start position:0%

services at department health and human
 
00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:40.390 align:start position:0%
services at department health and human
services

00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
so tell us what you want to tell us
 
00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
please uh just here to support what
 
00:39:46.069 --> 00:39:46.079 align:start position:0%
you're saying nancy are any questions
 
00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:47.200 align:start position:0%
about the
 
00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
the financial differences
 
00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
the labor grade 30 was a correction for
 
00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
that position the business system
 
00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
analyst two
 
00:39:59.910 --> 00:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
is a library 30 and that came at a
 
00:40:01.349 --> 00:40:01.359 align:start position:0%
if it was all general funds it would be
 
00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
228 000 but there is federal assistance
 
00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
in there that lowers that cost
 
00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
okay does it lower down to around 138
 
00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
000 in general funds i i don't want to
 
00:40:15.349 --> 00:40:15.359 align:start position:0%
have misrepresented it
 
00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
yeah 37 480 that's correct all right
 
00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
okay uh why don't you why don't you sit
 
00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
there uh for a moment are there any
 
00:40:25.349 --> 00:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
questions about that uh that
 
00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm not seeing any from the
 
00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
committee so so have you seen
 
00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:41.670 align:start position:0%
the amendment
1075

00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:43.829 --> 00:40:43.839 align:start position:0%
what this amendment does
 
00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
is as i as i reread the bill
 
00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
it seemed to me that it would be a fair
 
00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.589 align:start position:0%
it seemed to me that it would be a fair
interpretation

00:40:51.589 --> 00:40:51.599 align:start position:0%
interpretation
 
00:40:54.390 --> 00:40:54.400 align:start position:0%
if somebody thought they could write one
 
00:40:56.309 --> 00:40:56.319 align:start position:0%
privacy impact
 
00:40:58.710 --> 00:40:58.720 align:start position:0%
assessment which is the risk mitigation
 
00:41:01.829 --> 00:41:01.839 align:start position:0%
form that that they could write one and
 
00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
then it would automatically cover all of
 
00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
the i.t systems
 
00:41:09.349 --> 00:41:09.359 align:start position:0%
in the department
 
00:41:09.359 --> 00:41:10.230 align:start position:0%
in the department
the

00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:10.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
purpose of the privacy impact assessment
 
00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:16.640 align:start position:0%
is is each it system is to be evaluated
 
00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
on its own and completely and
 
00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
comprehensively so so the clarifying
 
00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:22.950 align:start position:0%
comprehensively so so the clarifying
language

00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:22.960 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:41:24.309 --> 00:41:24.319 align:start position:0%
is meant to
 
00:41:26.309 --> 00:41:26.319 align:start position:0%
just make sure that people understand
 
00:41:27.589 --> 00:41:27.599 align:start position:0%
that there's
 
00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:30.400 align:start position:0%
one for one privacy impact assessment
 
00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
per it system
 
00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
it reads for each information technology
 
00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
system that contains personal
 
00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
information the department shall conduct
 
00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
a written risk assessment and mitigation
 
00:41:43.109 --> 00:41:43.119 align:start position:0%
remediation plan in the form of a
 
00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
privacy impact assessment
 
00:41:47.589 --> 00:41:47.599 align:start position:0%
so that that's just clarifying what our
 
00:41:49.349 --> 00:41:49.359 align:start position:0%
intent always was
 
00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
do you do you have anything to say to
 
00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
that did you did you ever interpret it
 
00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
that one pia would handle you know like
 
00:41:57.430 --> 00:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
17 systems
 
00:41:59.349 --> 00:41:59.359 align:start position:0%
well we understand it exactly how you
 
00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
just explained it one for each
 
00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
individual system
 
00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:03.270 align:start position:0%
individual system
okay

00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:03.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
so uh let me ask mr ripple a question
 
00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:07.910 align:start position:0%
so uh let me ask mr ripple a question
um

00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:09.990 --> 00:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
given that the the department has
 
00:42:12.069 --> 00:42:12.079 align:start position:0%
identified that they could do this with
 
00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
a grade 30
 
00:42:15.349 --> 00:42:15.359 align:start position:0%
do you think
 
00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
that we need an amendment to change the
 
00:42:20.470 --> 00:42:20.480 align:start position:0%
32 to a 30 or or just leave that
 
00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
component in the in the bill as is
 
00:42:25.589 --> 00:42:25.599 align:start position:0%
i would suggest changing it from 32 to
 
00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
30 but i don't if you wanted to vote on
 
00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:28.640 align:start position:0%
this today i don't think you would need
 
00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
an amendment in front of you you could
 
00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for that um
 
00:42:40.870 --> 00:42:40.880 align:start position:0%
i i don't want to take a vote on this
 
00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
because uh
 
00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:44.800 align:start position:0%
i promise representative weiler i'd wait
 
00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
for him and he's at another uh meeting
 
00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
somewhere so
 
00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:49.980 align:start position:0%
somewhere so
um

00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:49.990 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:52.950 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

00:42:52.950 --> 00:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
with this i think if there's no one else
 
00:42:57.190 --> 00:42:57.200 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else in the room that
 
00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:00.160 align:start position:0%
wants to testify on 1662
 
00:43:01.349 --> 00:43:01.359 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
 
00:43:01.359 --> 00:43:03.349 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
committee

00:43:03.349 --> 00:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:43:05.589 --> 00:43:05.599 align:start position:0%
yes representative knight yes i just had
 
00:43:07.109 --> 00:43:07.119 align:start position:0%
one question we talked about the two new
 
00:43:07.119 --> 00:43:09.349 align:start position:0%
one question we talked about the two new
employees

00:43:09.349 --> 00:43:09.359 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:43:11.349 --> 00:43:11.359 align:start position:0%
but there were some other issues in the
 
00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
fiscal note that i never did understand
 
00:43:15.829 --> 00:43:15.839 align:start position:0%
where that money would be coming from
 
00:43:18.069 --> 00:43:18.079 align:start position:0%
and that's at least the fiscal note when
 
00:43:20.550 --> 00:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
it came through our department sorry our
 
00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:21.910 align:start position:0%
it came through our department sorry our
committee

00:43:21.910 --> 00:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
and that was on the second page of the
 
00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal note it talks about another four
 
00:43:27.910 --> 00:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
hundred and seventy thousand dollars for
 
00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
uh supporting analysis and assessments
 
00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
of symptom systems and a chief privacy
 
00:43:35.829 --> 00:43:35.839 align:start position:0%
offer officer at around 200k and so on
 
00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
i'm just confused are those
 
00:43:41.349 --> 00:43:41.359 align:start position:0%
we aren't discussing those in detail or
 
00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
is that because that's not the point of
 
00:43:47.109 --> 00:43:47.119 align:start position:0%
discussion here no no um
 
00:43:48.790 --> 00:43:48.800 align:start position:0%
you raise a point that should have been
 
00:43:51.349 --> 00:43:51.359 align:start position:0%
made up front is that the fiscal note
 
00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
that's attached
 
00:43:55.829 --> 00:43:55.839 align:start position:0%
was based on the bill as introduced and
 
00:43:58.550 --> 00:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
then we amended
 
00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
some major items out yeah and so
 
00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
major chunks of the fiscal note got
 
00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
pulled out
 
00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:08.720 align:start position:0%
to really now the fiscal note will be
 
00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:12.160 align:start position:0%
limited to the new employees that's my
 
00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:13.349 align:start position:0%
limited to the new employees that's my
understanding

00:44:13.349 --> 00:44:13.359 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:17.200 align:start position:0%
but that the lba has not yet produced a
 
00:44:19.829 --> 00:44:19.839 align:start position:0%
new fiscal note
 
00:44:21.670 --> 00:44:21.680 align:start position:0%
is is that correct representative ripple
 
00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
or how is it incorrect
 
00:44:26.069 --> 00:44:26.079 align:start position:0%
that is correct uh we haven't put out a
 
00:44:27.829 --> 00:44:27.839 align:start position:0%
new fiscal note yet but i do have the
 
00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
information that the department provided
 
00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
to us which shows the net cost of around
 
00:44:33.910 --> 00:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
130 000 per year that you mentioned
 
00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:35.440 align:start position:0%
previously i can hand this out if you
 
00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:37.990 align:start position:0%
previously i can hand this out if you
want

00:44:37.990 --> 00:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:39.190 --> 00:44:39.200 align:start position:0%
would you like a copy of that
 
00:44:40.870 --> 00:44:40.880 align:start position:0%
representative conner
 
00:44:43.109 --> 00:44:43.119 align:start position:0%
no i trust you i just i just wanted
 
00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
this was just never resolved for me
 
00:44:47.109 --> 00:44:47.119 align:start position:0%
earlier or at this point thank you
 
00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:48.400 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:50.950 align:start position:0%
all right
um

00:44:50.950 --> 00:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:54.160 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions on this
 
00:44:56.630 --> 00:44:56.640 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else here in the room
 
00:45:01.250 --> 00:45:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:02.950 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:45:05.109 --> 00:45:05.119 align:start position:0%
so i'm just thinking about the proper
 
00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
motion here i think i think what we're
 
00:45:10.069 --> 00:45:10.079 align:start position:0%
going to do is uh allow
 
00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
the lba to generate another minor
 
00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:14.790 align:start position:0%
the lba to generate another minor
amendment

00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh to change the labor grade
 
00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
from 32 to 30
 
00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
to go ahead and add
 
00:45:24.710 --> 00:45:24.720 align:start position:0%
does anybody
 
00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
oppose adding
 
00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:28.349 align:start position:0%
oppose adding
amendment

00:45:28.349 --> 00:45:28.359 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
1075 which clarifies the language for
 
00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
for each
 
00:45:35.109 --> 00:45:35.119 align:start position:0%
now i'm not seeing any
 
00:45:37.109 --> 00:45:37.119 align:start position:0%
so we'll go ahead and incorporate that
 
00:45:41.109 --> 00:45:41.119 align:start position:0%
and then next monday we can reconsider
 
00:45:41.119 --> 00:45:42.270 align:start position:0%
and then next monday we can reconsider
um

00:45:42.270 --> 00:45:42.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:43.829 align:start position:0%
um
1662.

00:45:43.829 --> 00:45:43.839 align:start position:0%
1662.
 
00:45:45.230 --> 00:45:45.240 align:start position:0%
and with that
 
00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:55.349 --> 00:45:55.359 align:start position:0%
the the next bill that we have up is uh
 
00:45:55.359 --> 00:45:58.309 align:start position:0%
the the next bill that we have up is uh
1609

00:45:58.309 --> 00:45:58.319 align:start position:0%
1609
 
00:46:02.710 --> 00:46:02.720 align:start position:0%
and um i i had i had budgeted a couple
 
00:46:04.790 --> 00:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
hours for us to get through these three
 
00:46:08.470 --> 00:46:08.480 align:start position:0%
bills and we did it in 50 minutes
 
00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
so um but because we're in the house
 
00:46:12.790 --> 00:46:12.800 align:start position:0%
calendar at one o'clock we have to
 
00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:14.880 align:start position:0%

00:46:25.829 --> 00:46:25.839 align:start position:0%

00:46:28.230 --> 00:46:28.240 align:start position:0%
specific time to make sure that people
 
00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:30.400 align:start position:0%

okay
so

02:59:11.269 --> 02:59:11.279 align:start position:0%

secretary just
 
02:59:45.670 --> 02:59:45.680 align:start position:0%

02:59:55.110 --> 02:59:55.120 align:start position:0%
i think
 
02:59:56.469 --> 02:59:56.479 align:start position:0%
that i want to
 
02:59:59.670 --> 02:59:59.680 align:start position:0%
begin by saying i'm not a doctor i don't
 
03:00:00.790 --> 03:00:00.800 align:start position:0%
know any
 
03:00:03.269 --> 03:00:03.279 align:start position:0%
a lot of these medical terms
 
03:00:04.710 --> 03:00:04.720 align:start position:0%
i know
 
03:00:08.070 --> 03:00:08.080 align:start position:0%
a daughter that i have very very well
 
03:00:11.190 --> 03:00:11.200 align:start position:0%
who's going through a troubled pregnancy
 
03:00:12.230 --> 03:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
right now
 
03:00:14.550 --> 03:00:14.560 align:start position:0%
it gives me a new insight into what is
 
03:00:17.510 --> 03:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:19.990 --> 03:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
and i understand that there are some
 
03:00:22.950 --> 03:00:22.960 align:start position:0%
issues on 1609
 
03:00:25.590 --> 03:00:25.600 align:start position:0%
when i brought it forward
 
03:00:27.110 --> 03:00:27.120 align:start position:0%
it was basically
 
03:00:28.550 --> 03:00:28.560 align:start position:0%
to allow
 
03:00:30.309 --> 03:00:30.319 align:start position:0%
certain exceptions
 
03:00:32.070 --> 03:00:32.080 align:start position:0%
an exception for rape
 
03:00:34.870 --> 03:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
an exception for incest
 
03:00:36.630 --> 03:00:36.640 align:start position:0%
and i understand
 
03:00:40.630 --> 03:00:40.640 align:start position:0%
from my discussions that people
 
03:00:43.590 --> 03:00:43.600 align:start position:0%
have become mired in the fact that there
 
03:00:44.710 --> 03:00:44.720 align:start position:0%
may be
 
03:00:46.950 --> 03:00:46.960 align:start position:0%
a huge number of people that are going
 
03:00:49.830 --> 03:00:49.840 align:start position:0%
to use rape or incest for an excuse to
 
03:00:51.349 --> 03:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
get an abortion
 
03:00:53.269 --> 03:00:53.279 align:start position:0%
i don't believe anybody will be doing
 
03:00:53.279 --> 03:00:54.870 align:start position:0%
i don't believe anybody will be doing
that

03:00:54.870 --> 03:00:54.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:00:57.670 --> 03:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
but there are ways to eliminate those
 
03:00:57.680 --> 03:01:00.309 align:start position:0%
but there are ways to eliminate those
possibilities

03:01:00.309 --> 03:01:00.319 align:start position:0%
possibilities
 
03:01:03.510 --> 03:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
i think this bill is a good bill but it
 
03:01:05.269 --> 03:01:05.279 align:start position:0%
may need some
 
03:01:05.279 --> 03:01:06.790 align:start position:0%
may need some
modifications

03:01:06.790 --> 03:01:06.800 align:start position:0%
modifications
 
03:01:09.349 --> 03:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
and i am willing as a sponsor
 
03:01:09.359 --> 03:01:10.309 align:start position:0%
and i am willing as a sponsor
to

03:01:10.309 --> 03:01:10.319 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:01:13.269 --> 03:01:13.279 align:start position:0%
propose those to work with you to amend
 
03:01:13.279 --> 03:01:14.870 align:start position:0%
propose those to work with you to amend
it

03:01:14.870 --> 03:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:01:16.950 --> 03:01:16.960 align:start position:0%
i'm most concerned
 
03:01:16.960 --> 03:01:18.070 align:start position:0%
i'm most concerned
about

03:01:18.070 --> 03:01:18.080 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:01:19.349 --> 03:01:19.359 align:start position:0%
the health
 
03:01:21.910 --> 03:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
safety of the mother
 
03:01:21.920 --> 03:01:23.910 align:start position:0%
safety of the mother
and

03:01:23.910 --> 03:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:01:23.920 --> 03:01:24.870 align:start position:0%
and
the

03:01:24.870 --> 03:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:01:24.880 --> 03:01:26.790 align:start position:0%
the
fetus

03:01:26.790 --> 03:01:26.800 align:start position:0%
fetus
 
03:01:28.950 --> 03:01:28.960 align:start position:0%
and in that regard
 
03:01:31.110 --> 03:01:31.120 align:start position:0%
i think there should be some changes
 
03:01:31.120 --> 03:01:32.070 align:start position:0%
i think there should be some changes
made

03:01:32.070 --> 03:01:32.080 align:start position:0%
made
 
03:01:32.080 --> 03:01:33.269 align:start position:0%
made
after

03:01:33.269 --> 03:01:33.279 align:start position:0%
after
 
03:01:35.269 --> 03:01:35.279 align:start position:0%
working on this bill for almost six
 
03:01:35.279 --> 03:01:38.790 align:start position:0%
working on this bill for almost six
months

03:01:38.790 --> 03:01:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:42.150 --> 03:01:42.160 align:start position:0%
i would keep the 24-week ban on
 
03:01:42.160 --> 03:01:43.670 align:start position:0%
i would keep the 24-week ban on
abortions

03:01:43.670 --> 03:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
abortions
 
03:01:46.070 --> 03:01:46.080 align:start position:0%
that's a reasonable number
 
03:01:49.510 --> 03:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
and i'm not looking to change it
 
03:01:51.349 --> 03:01:51.359 align:start position:0%
i am looking
 
03:01:54.790 --> 03:01:54.800 align:start position:0%
to eliminate the exception
 
03:01:57.429 --> 03:01:57.439 align:start position:0%
to have rape and incest
 
03:01:57.439 --> 03:01:58.389 align:start position:0%
to have rape and incest
as

03:01:58.389 --> 03:01:58.399 align:start position:0%
as
 
03:02:02.070 --> 03:02:02.080 align:start position:0%
a reason for abortion after the 24 week
 
03:02:02.080 --> 03:02:03.110 align:start position:0%
a reason for abortion after the 24 week
period

03:02:03.110 --> 03:02:03.120 align:start position:0%
period
 
03:02:05.590 --> 03:02:05.600 align:start position:0%
so we could eliminate those two
 
03:02:05.600 --> 03:02:07.830 align:start position:0%
so we could eliminate those two
problems

03:02:07.830 --> 03:02:07.840 align:start position:0%
problems
 
03:02:09.269 --> 03:02:09.279 align:start position:0%
but what i would
 
03:02:09.279 --> 03:02:10.230 align:start position:0%
but what i would
really

03:02:10.230 --> 03:02:10.240 align:start position:0%
really
 
03:02:12.150 --> 03:02:12.160 align:start position:0%
want to see happen
 
03:02:16.630 --> 03:02:16.640 align:start position:0%
is that an abortion at any time
 
03:02:18.230 --> 03:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
would be allowed
 
03:02:19.990 --> 03:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
for the health
 
03:02:21.510 --> 03:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
and life
 
03:02:23.830 --> 03:02:23.840 align:start position:0%
of the mother
 
03:02:25.429 --> 03:02:25.439 align:start position:0%
i would also want
 
03:02:29.190 --> 03:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
an abortion allowed for fetal abnormal
 
03:02:29.200 --> 03:02:31.110 align:start position:0%
an abortion allowed for fetal abnormal
no

03:02:31.110 --> 03:02:31.120 align:start position:0%
no
 
03:02:32.389 --> 03:02:32.399 align:start position:0%
you know what i'm trying to say
 
03:02:32.399 --> 03:02:34.150 align:start position:0%
you know what i'm trying to say
anomalies

03:02:34.150 --> 03:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
anomalies
 
03:02:35.750 --> 03:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:02:35.760 --> 03:02:38.070 align:start position:0%
thank you
representatives

03:02:38.070 --> 03:02:38.080 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
03:02:42.389 --> 03:02:42.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:45.910 --> 03:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:47.269 --> 03:02:47.279 align:start position:0%
should be
 
03:02:47.279 --> 03:02:48.950 align:start position:0%
should be
eliminated

03:02:48.950 --> 03:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
eliminated
 
03:02:53.990 --> 03:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
again but at 24 weeks it comes back in
 
03:02:55.190 --> 03:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
i think
 
03:02:56.950 --> 03:02:56.960 align:start position:0%
that any
 
03:02:56.960 --> 03:02:58.550 align:start position:0%
that any
physician

03:02:58.550 --> 03:02:58.560 align:start position:0%
physician
 
03:03:00.550 --> 03:03:00.560 align:start position:0%
that is performing
 
03:03:02.150 --> 03:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
an abortion
 
03:03:05.590 --> 03:03:05.600 align:start position:0%
after or close to 24 weeks
 
03:03:08.230 --> 03:03:08.240 align:start position:0%
should have a penalty if they haven't
 
03:03:11.510 --> 03:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:14.630 --> 03:03:14.640 align:start position:0%
i'm not really
 
03:03:16.790 --> 03:03:16.800 align:start position:0%
in favor of a criminal penalty i could
 
03:03:19.190 --> 03:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
live with a civil penalty and maybe even
 
03:03:21.670 --> 03:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
a loss of license those are important
 
03:03:21.680 --> 03:03:23.510 align:start position:0%
a loss of license those are important
things

03:03:23.510 --> 03:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
things
 
03:03:27.910 --> 03:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
so what i am saying here is
 
03:03:27.920 --> 03:03:28.790 align:start position:0%
so what i am saying here is
that

03:03:28.790 --> 03:03:28.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:03:30.469 --> 03:03:30.479 align:start position:0%
i would be willing
 
03:03:31.990 --> 03:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
and desirous
 
03:03:34.070 --> 03:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
of working with you
 
03:03:34.080 --> 03:03:34.950 align:start position:0%
of working with you
to

03:03:34.950 --> 03:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:03:34.960 --> 03:03:36.150 align:start position:0%
to
modify

03:03:36.150 --> 03:03:36.160 align:start position:0%
modify
 
03:03:38.830 --> 03:03:38.840 align:start position:0%
this bill in a way that it becomes
 
03:03:42.070 --> 03:03:42.080 align:start position:0%
acceptable to me it's critical
 
03:03:44.150 --> 03:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
it's critical
 
03:03:46.070 --> 03:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
that we protect
 
03:03:46.080 --> 03:03:48.070 align:start position:0%
that we protect
women

03:03:48.070 --> 03:03:48.080 align:start position:0%
women
 
03:03:50.950 --> 03:03:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:52.790 --> 03:03:52.800 align:start position:0%
facing death
 
03:03:55.429 --> 03:03:55.439 align:start position:0%
because of a pregnancy
 
03:03:58.150 --> 03:03:58.160 align:start position:0%
or having to carry a fetus
 
03:03:59.830 --> 03:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
to term
 
03:04:04.309 --> 03:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:04.319 --> 03:04:05.110 align:start position:0%
 
and

03:04:05.110 --> 03:04:05.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:04:07.750 --> 03:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
i hope that you people will not be
 
03:04:09.750 --> 03:04:09.760 align:start position:0%
making a medical decision
 
03:04:11.269 --> 03:04:11.279 align:start position:0%
for somebody who should be making a
 
03:04:11.279 --> 03:04:12.389 align:start position:0%
for somebody who should be making a
decision

03:04:12.389 --> 03:04:12.399 align:start position:0%
decision
 
03:04:12.399 --> 03:04:13.590 align:start position:0%
decision
between

03:04:13.590 --> 03:04:13.600 align:start position:0%
between
 
03:04:13.600 --> 03:04:14.790 align:start position:0%
between
herself

03:04:14.790 --> 03:04:14.800 align:start position:0%
herself
 
03:04:18.550 --> 03:04:18.560 align:start position:0%
her spouse and her doctor and possibly
 
03:04:18.560 --> 03:04:20.830 align:start position:0%
her spouse and her doctor and possibly
her

03:04:20.830 --> 03:04:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:23.510 --> 03:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
um priest
 
03:04:26.309 --> 03:04:26.319 align:start position:0%
so without getting into a lot of details
 
03:04:28.710 --> 03:04:28.720 align:start position:0%
that's the summit substance i think that
 
03:04:30.469 --> 03:04:30.479 align:start position:0%
the bill should be
 
03:04:33.510 --> 03:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
modified but it should be passed
 
03:04:39.110 --> 03:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:41.670 --> 03:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
so so let me contextualize where where i
 
03:04:43.830 --> 03:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
think we're at
 
03:04:43.840 --> 03:04:45.110 align:start position:0%
think we're at
um

03:04:45.110 --> 03:04:45.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:04:47.110 --> 03:04:47.120 align:start position:0%
i i think this committee
 
03:04:51.190 --> 03:04:51.200 align:start position:0%
needs to be done with 1609
 
03:04:53.830 --> 03:04:53.840 align:start position:0%
next week we have next week monday the
 
03:04:56.389 --> 03:04:56.399 align:start position:0%
21st on the calendar
 
03:04:58.790 --> 03:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
so if there is an amendment for us to
 
03:04:58.800 --> 03:05:00.389 align:start position:0%
so if there is an amendment for us to
consider

03:05:00.389 --> 03:05:00.399 align:start position:0%
consider
 
03:05:01.990 --> 03:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
we would need to see that in the next
 
03:05:05.510 --> 03:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
couple of days and so that we can think
 
03:05:08.070 --> 03:05:08.080 align:start position:0%
about it we can consult with others
 
03:05:11.670 --> 03:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
and we can roll in here on the 21st
 
03:05:13.510 --> 03:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
prepared to
 
03:05:15.110 --> 03:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
give a recommendation to the full
 
03:05:16.710 --> 03:05:16.720 align:start position:0%
finance committee
 
03:05:19.990 --> 03:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
so so so that's that's part of the
 
03:05:20.000 --> 03:05:22.070 align:start position:0%
so so so that's that's part of the
context

03:05:22.070 --> 03:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
context
 
03:05:24.790 --> 03:05:24.800 align:start position:0%
uh the other context to share with you
 
03:05:27.830 --> 03:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
to be to be fair now with you
 
03:05:29.269 --> 03:05:29.279 align:start position:0%
is that
 
03:05:29.279 --> 03:05:30.070 align:start position:0%
is that
um

03:05:30.070 --> 03:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:05:35.030 --> 03:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
the language that got adopted into hb2
 
03:05:35.040 --> 03:05:36.150 align:start position:0%
the language that got adopted into hb2
um

03:05:36.150 --> 03:05:36.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:05:36.160 --> 03:05:37.269 align:start position:0%
um
was

03:05:37.269 --> 03:05:37.279 align:start position:0%
was
 
03:05:39.190 --> 03:05:39.200 align:start position:0%
an essential part
 
03:05:43.190 --> 03:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:47.190 --> 03:05:47.200 align:start position:0%
set of agreements that were necessary
 
03:05:49.429 --> 03:05:49.439 align:start position:0%
for us to get the votes to pass the
 
03:05:49.439 --> 03:05:50.790 align:start position:0%
for us to get the votes to pass the
budget

03:05:50.790 --> 03:05:50.800 align:start position:0%
budget
 
03:05:53.429 --> 03:05:53.439 align:start position:0%
and if we
 
03:05:53.439 --> 03:05:54.469 align:start position:0%
and if we
got

03:05:54.469 --> 03:05:54.479 align:start position:0%
got
 
03:05:57.030 --> 03:05:57.040 align:start position:0%
1609 which is the language used by
 
03:05:58.389 --> 03:05:58.399 align:start position:0%
people who
 
03:05:58.399 --> 03:05:59.510 align:start position:0%
people who
are

03:05:59.510 --> 03:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:06:01.750 --> 03:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
like what's in our law now they consider
 
03:06:03.910 --> 03:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
this an attempt to gut the bill
 
03:06:03.920 --> 03:06:05.349 align:start position:0%
this an attempt to gut the bill
um

03:06:05.349 --> 03:06:05.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:06:07.510 --> 03:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
we would need to do it in a way in which
 
03:06:10.150 --> 03:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
we would have we would be preserving in
 
03:06:12.790 --> 03:06:12.800 align:start position:0%
my opinion we need to preserve
 
03:06:15.429 --> 03:06:15.439 align:start position:0%
the integrity of the promises that have
 
03:06:17.269 --> 03:06:17.279 align:start position:0%
been made to the people who voted for
 
03:06:17.279 --> 03:06:18.469 align:start position:0%
been made to the people who voted for
this

03:06:18.469 --> 03:06:18.479 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:06:20.630 --> 03:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
because we're only 15 months away from a
 
03:06:23.269 --> 03:06:23.279 align:start position:0%
new budget new set of agreements
 
03:06:25.190 --> 03:06:25.200 align:start position:0%
and if we burn
 
03:06:27.670 --> 03:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
the bridges of our credibility
 
03:06:29.830 --> 03:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
it'll be just that much more difficult
 
03:06:31.910 --> 03:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
in the future to come to
 
03:06:34.630 --> 03:06:34.640 align:start position:0%
um budget resolution
 
03:06:34.640 --> 03:06:35.429 align:start position:0%
um budget resolution
so

03:06:35.429 --> 03:06:35.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:06:38.230 --> 03:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
so i would i would want
 
03:06:40.710 --> 03:06:40.720 align:start position:0%
to to entertain an amendment that you
 
03:06:42.710 --> 03:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
may want to put forward representative
 
03:06:42.720 --> 03:06:44.389 align:start position:0%
may want to put forward representative
wolf

03:06:44.389 --> 03:06:44.399 align:start position:0%
wolf
 
03:06:46.469 --> 03:06:46.479 align:start position:0%
i'd ask you to try to
 
03:06:46.479 --> 03:06:47.670 align:start position:0%
i'd ask you to try to
get

03:06:47.670 --> 03:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
get
 
03:06:47.680 --> 03:06:48.550 align:start position:0%
get
help

03:06:48.550 --> 03:06:48.560 align:start position:0%
help
 
03:06:50.389 --> 03:06:50.399 align:start position:0%
to get it in the next
 
03:06:53.349 --> 03:06:53.359 align:start position:0%
48 hours 72 hours
 
03:06:55.429 --> 03:06:55.439 align:start position:0%
and and i have i have some questions for
 
03:06:58.230 --> 03:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
you just to clarify um
 
03:06:59.910 --> 03:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
what i think you're saying yes sir go
 
03:06:59.920 --> 03:07:01.030 align:start position:0%
what i think you're saying yes sir go
ahead

03:07:01.030 --> 03:07:01.040 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
03:07:04.070 --> 03:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
i'd like to just respond to
 
03:07:06.309 --> 03:07:06.319 align:start position:0%
your comment about commitments that were
 
03:07:06.319 --> 03:07:08.550 align:start position:0%
your comment about commitments that were
made

03:07:08.550 --> 03:07:08.560 align:start position:0%
made
 
03:07:10.389 --> 03:07:10.399 align:start position:0%
i remember we were down in the sports
 
03:07:13.349 --> 03:07:13.359 align:start position:0%
complex down there in bedford when the
 
03:07:16.469 --> 03:07:16.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:18.630 --> 03:07:18.640 align:start position:0%
and there were several reps that came up
 
03:07:21.910 --> 03:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:24.550 --> 03:07:24.560 align:start position:0%
and the governor
 
03:07:26.550 --> 03:07:26.560 align:start position:0%
and they said to me
 
03:07:29.110 --> 03:07:29.120 align:start position:0%
we'd like you to vote for the bill
 
03:07:30.550 --> 03:07:30.560 align:start position:0%
and we'll
 
03:07:33.110 --> 03:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
meet you afterwards
 
03:07:35.030 --> 03:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
to work out some of these things that
 
03:07:37.110 --> 03:07:37.120 align:start position:0%
were troubling to you
 
03:07:38.550 --> 03:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
i knew
 
03:07:38.560 --> 03:07:39.510 align:start position:0%
i knew
that

03:07:39.510 --> 03:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:07:41.349 --> 03:07:41.359 align:start position:0%
nothing about any
 
03:07:45.590 --> 03:07:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:47.750 --> 03:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
and now i sit here
 
03:07:50.389 --> 03:07:50.399 align:start position:0%
and find out that a deal was made
 
03:07:52.389 --> 03:07:52.399 align:start position:0%
and i have to tell you
 
03:07:55.910 --> 03:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
that my credibility feels pretty short
 
03:07:57.349 --> 03:07:57.359 align:start position:0%
because i would have voted against that
 
03:07:59.429 --> 03:07:59.439 align:start position:0%
budget if i knew we weren't going to be
 
03:08:00.630 --> 03:08:00.640 align:start position:0%
able to
 
03:08:00.640 --> 03:08:01.830 align:start position:0%
able to
modify

03:08:01.830 --> 03:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
modify
 
03:08:04.469 --> 03:08:04.479 align:start position:0%
to some degree i'm not talking about
 
03:08:08.230 --> 03:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
gutting the bill i'm talking about
 
03:08:10.550 --> 03:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
after 24 weeks
 
03:08:11.910 --> 03:08:11.920 align:start position:0%
for fetal
 
03:08:15.030 --> 03:08:15.040 align:start position:0%
abnormalities incompatible with life
 
03:08:17.190 --> 03:08:17.200 align:start position:0%
i'm talking about
 
03:08:18.950 --> 03:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
a situation
 
03:08:21.349 --> 03:08:21.359 align:start position:0%
that affects the mother the health and
 
03:08:25.110 --> 03:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
life of the mother after 24 weeks
 
03:08:26.710 --> 03:08:26.720 align:start position:0%
i'm talking about eliminating the
 
03:08:31.429 --> 03:08:31.439 align:start position:0%
ultrasound up to approximately 24 weeks
 
03:08:31.439 --> 03:08:32.469 align:start position:0%
ultrasound up to approximately 24 weeks
so

03:08:32.469 --> 03:08:32.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:08:35.030 --> 03:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
i am and i'm leaving the penalties in to
 
03:08:38.630 --> 03:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
a degree so i'm not gutting the bill
 
03:08:41.510 --> 03:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
i'm making it a living bill that the
 
03:08:43.429 --> 03:08:43.439 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire can be proud of
 
03:08:43.439 --> 03:08:45.990 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire can be proud of
having

03:08:45.990 --> 03:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:51.110 --> 03:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:53.349 --> 03:08:53.359 align:start position:0%
okay i i just would want to point out
 
03:08:56.070 --> 03:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
that the word deal uh sounds like a a
 
03:08:58.150 --> 03:08:58.160 align:start position:0%
little bit of a pejorative there have
 
03:09:00.550 --> 03:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
been agreements made i guess it's fair
 
03:09:02.389 --> 03:09:02.399 align:start position:0%
to call them deals but
 
03:09:05.349 --> 03:09:05.359 align:start position:0%
it's sort of a a hot button word i think
 
03:09:08.309 --> 03:09:08.319 align:start position:0%
in this context uh good faith
 
03:09:10.870 --> 03:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
discussions and agreements were made yes
 
03:09:14.469 --> 03:09:14.479 align:start position:0%
you grew those deals sure if you want to
 
03:09:14.479 --> 03:09:15.269 align:start position:0%
you grew those deals sure if you want to
if

03:09:15.269 --> 03:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
if
 
03:09:16.950 --> 03:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
if there's an attempt to cast this in
 
03:09:18.870 --> 03:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
more political terms but
 
03:09:21.349 --> 03:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
um okay so i do want to go through your
 
03:09:23.429 --> 03:09:23.439 align:start position:0%
checklist to share some concerns with
 
03:09:24.870 --> 03:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
you um
 
03:09:24.880 --> 03:09:26.309 align:start position:0%
you um
so

03:09:26.309 --> 03:09:26.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:09:26.319 --> 03:09:28.830 align:start position:0%
so
uh

03:09:28.830 --> 03:09:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:31.830 --> 03:09:31.840 align:start position:0%
oh i just ask once again
 
03:09:35.590 --> 03:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
um how this deals with the fiscal policy
 
03:09:37.510 --> 03:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
um the various
 
03:09:40.469 --> 03:09:40.479 align:start position:0%
amendments that you're talking about um
 
03:09:42.870 --> 03:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
as i stated this morning i thought that
 
03:09:46.150 --> 03:09:46.160 align:start position:0%
we were to deal with fiscal policy on
 
03:09:47.990 --> 03:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
bills that come to us as a second
 
03:09:50.469 --> 03:09:50.479 align:start position:0%
committee and not change the policy that
 
03:09:52.790 --> 03:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
the policy committee agreed so
 
03:09:55.510 --> 03:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
okay so representative rogers
 
03:09:57.110 --> 03:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
i think
 
03:10:00.229 --> 03:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
our ability to talk about the policy in
 
03:10:02.710 --> 03:10:02.720 align:start position:0%
this case comes from the fact that this
 
03:10:05.750 --> 03:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
got this issue was embedded in to the
 
03:10:05.760 --> 03:10:07.349 align:start position:0%
got this issue was embedded in to the
hb2

03:10:07.349 --> 03:10:07.359 align:start position:0%
hb2
 
03:10:09.750 --> 03:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
and it was done so with a lot of
 
03:10:11.510 --> 03:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
agreements in place
 
03:10:11.520 --> 03:10:12.630 align:start position:0%
agreements in place
and

03:10:12.630 --> 03:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:10:15.910 --> 03:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
if finance were to be part of a process
 
03:10:18.389 --> 03:10:18.399 align:start position:0%
to substantially change what went into
 
03:10:18.399 --> 03:10:19.750 align:start position:0%
to substantially change what went into
hb2

03:10:19.750 --> 03:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
hb2
 
03:10:21.670 --> 03:10:21.680 align:start position:0%
i think that would call into
 
03:10:21.680 --> 03:10:23.110 align:start position:0%
i think that would call into
doubt

03:10:23.110 --> 03:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
doubt
 
03:10:25.830 --> 03:10:25.840 align:start position:0%
the credibility of the finance committee
 
03:10:29.110 --> 03:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
and and harm our ability to
 
03:10:29.120 --> 03:10:30.469 align:start position:0%
and and harm our ability to
have

03:10:30.469 --> 03:10:30.479 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:10:32.950 --> 03:10:32.960 align:start position:0%
budgets agreed to in the future
 
03:10:35.429 --> 03:10:35.439 align:start position:0%
so i i think this is almost an
 
03:10:38.150 --> 03:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
existential issue to our ability to get
 
03:10:40.790 --> 03:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
the next budget in place
 
03:10:42.710 --> 03:10:42.720 align:start position:0%
the reason i'm wanting to talk to
 
03:10:44.710 --> 03:10:44.720 align:start position:0%
representative wolf have have this
 
03:10:46.550 --> 03:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
committee talk to him
 
03:10:48.550 --> 03:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
is because i think
 
03:10:51.670 --> 03:10:51.680 align:start position:0%
that there may be some room for us
 
03:10:51.680 --> 03:10:53.830 align:start position:0%
that there may be some room for us
to

03:10:53.830 --> 03:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:10:56.790 --> 03:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
some of the issues he's he's raising
 
03:10:59.190 --> 03:10:59.200 align:start position:0%
in a way in which we're really not
 
03:11:02.229 --> 03:11:02.239 align:start position:0%
violating the fundamental principles and
 
03:11:03.750 --> 03:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
agreements that we
 
03:11:05.429 --> 03:11:05.439 align:start position:0%
came to in june
 
03:11:08.630 --> 03:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
so so i'd like to go through and have a
 
03:11:11.269 --> 03:11:11.279 align:start position:0%
conversation with representative wolf on
 
03:11:14.309 --> 03:11:14.319 align:start position:0%
some of these issues so that we can
 
03:11:17.910 --> 03:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
help him with an amendment
 
03:11:19.510 --> 03:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
do you have a follow-up to that
 
03:11:22.389 --> 03:11:22.399 align:start position:0%
representative rogers
 
03:11:24.229 --> 03:11:24.239 align:start position:0%
no i think i've made my point and i
 
03:11:26.229 --> 03:11:26.239 align:start position:0%
still agree with my point but i
 
03:11:28.229 --> 03:11:28.239 align:start position:0%
accept what you said thank you
 
03:11:29.670 --> 03:11:29.680 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
03:11:29.680 --> 03:11:30.870 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
so

03:11:30.870 --> 03:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:11:32.710 --> 03:11:32.720 align:start position:0%
fetal anomaly
 
03:11:35.030 --> 03:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
um that's incompatible with life let's
 
03:11:36.870 --> 03:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
talk about that for a second
 
03:11:39.510 --> 03:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
i i think
 
03:11:40.790 --> 03:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
the concern
 
03:11:42.550 --> 03:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
about adding that
 
03:11:44.550 --> 03:11:44.560 align:start position:0%
is that
 
03:11:46.150 --> 03:11:46.160 align:start position:0%
one it would
 
03:11:47.349 --> 03:11:47.359 align:start position:0%
depend on
 
03:11:50.790 --> 03:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
a diagnosis of of an obstetrician
 
03:11:50.800 --> 03:11:51.830 align:start position:0%
a diagnosis of of an obstetrician
and

03:11:51.830 --> 03:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:11:53.990 --> 03:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
oftentimes a diagnosis during a
 
03:11:56.630 --> 03:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
pregnancy about the future health of the
 
03:11:56.640 --> 03:11:57.590 align:start position:0%
pregnancy about the future health of the
baby

03:11:57.590 --> 03:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
baby
 
03:12:01.190 --> 03:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
is is it is not accurate and
 
03:12:03.830 --> 03:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
um and because that's just
 
03:12:05.990 --> 03:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
natural human behavior because it's a
 
03:12:08.229 --> 03:12:08.239 align:start position:0%
difficult situation to come up with the
 
03:12:08.239 --> 03:12:09.830 align:start position:0%
difficult situation to come up with the
diagnosis

03:12:09.830 --> 03:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
diagnosis
 
03:12:09.840 --> 03:12:12.469 align:start position:0%
diagnosis
um

03:12:12.469 --> 03:12:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:14.630 --> 03:12:14.640 align:start position:0%
it may be the case that we would want to
 
03:12:14.640 --> 03:12:16.790 align:start position:0%
it may be the case that we would want to
require

03:12:16.790 --> 03:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
require
 
03:12:19.190 --> 03:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
an autopsy or something to confirm
 
03:12:22.070 --> 03:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
whether or not the diagnosis was
 
03:12:24.550 --> 03:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
valid whether it was correct
 
03:12:26.550 --> 03:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
03:12:28.309 --> 03:12:28.319 align:start position:0%
i'm just throwing some thoughts at you
 
03:12:28.319 --> 03:12:29.910 align:start position:0%
i'm just throwing some thoughts at you
yeah

03:12:29.910 --> 03:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:12:31.750 --> 03:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
excuse me for
 
03:12:33.990 --> 03:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
my facial experience no no that's fine
 
03:12:35.349 --> 03:12:35.359 align:start position:0%
this is why
 
03:12:37.429 --> 03:12:37.439 align:start position:0%
an autopsy would be a little bit late i
 
03:12:37.439 --> 03:12:38.150 align:start position:0%
an autopsy would be a little bit late i
think

03:12:38.150 --> 03:12:38.160 align:start position:0%
think
 
03:12:41.349 --> 03:12:41.359 align:start position:0%
well on the fetus it would be able to
 
03:12:44.309 --> 03:12:44.319 align:start position:0%
to confirm the diagnosis perhaps but
 
03:12:46.550 --> 03:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
perhaps again again i'm not a provider
 
03:12:49.590 --> 03:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
like you and and i i liked your facial
 
03:12:52.630 --> 03:12:52.640 align:start position:0%
expression this is why we meet in public
 
03:12:55.030 --> 03:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
is because there's more to communication
 
03:12:58.150 --> 03:12:58.160 align:start position:0%
than just a zoom meeting so
 
03:13:00.150 --> 03:13:00.160 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:13:03.110 --> 03:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
non-verbal communication counts
 
03:13:06.550 --> 03:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
okay so um the other concern around
 
03:13:08.309 --> 03:13:08.319 align:start position:0%
fetal anomalies
 
03:13:10.550 --> 03:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
is that
 
03:13:12.309 --> 03:13:12.319 align:start position:0%
uh the definition
 
03:13:14.710 --> 03:13:14.720 align:start position:0%
of incompatible with life is not at all
 
03:13:14.720 --> 03:13:15.670 align:start position:0%
of incompatible with life is not at all
clear

03:13:15.670 --> 03:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
clear
 
03:13:17.190 --> 03:13:17.200 align:start position:0%
so if somebody
 
03:13:17.200 --> 03:13:18.309 align:start position:0%
so if somebody
uh

03:13:18.309 --> 03:13:18.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:13:20.469 --> 03:13:20.479 align:start position:0%
diagnosed the baby
 
03:13:20.479 --> 03:13:22.389 align:start position:0%
diagnosed the baby
um

03:13:22.389 --> 03:13:22.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:13:25.110 --> 03:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
as having down syndrome for example
 
03:13:28.229 --> 03:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
you know i'd want to know if that would
 
03:13:28.239 --> 03:13:29.190 align:start position:0%
you know i'd want to know if that would
count

03:13:29.190 --> 03:13:29.200 align:start position:0%
count
 
03:13:31.670 --> 03:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
as a fetal anomaly incompatible with
 
03:13:32.950 --> 03:13:32.960 align:start position:0%
life or not
 
03:13:34.469 --> 03:13:34.479 align:start position:0%
and if it didn't
 
03:13:37.110 --> 03:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
i'd want to see a definition
 
03:13:39.349 --> 03:13:39.359 align:start position:0%
that we could be confident in
 
03:13:42.950 --> 03:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
that would would rule out those kinds of
 
03:13:45.190 --> 03:13:45.200 align:start position:0%
things that make life difficult
 
03:13:45.200 --> 03:13:46.070 align:start position:0%
things that make life difficult
but

03:13:46.070 --> 03:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:13:50.550 --> 03:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:52.070 --> 03:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
go ahead go ahead you can respond to
 
03:13:53.670 --> 03:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
that because and then i'll hit the other
 
03:13:57.349 --> 03:13:57.359 align:start position:0%
bullets too i'll try i'm not a doctor
 
03:13:59.349 --> 03:13:59.359 align:start position:0%
i see we have one over there that may be
 
03:14:01.990 --> 03:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
able to help us but
 
03:14:04.309 --> 03:14:04.319 align:start position:0%
i don't think that down syndrome is
 
03:14:06.630 --> 03:14:06.640 align:start position:0%
incompatible with life
 
03:14:10.229 --> 03:14:10.239 align:start position:0%
i have a wonderful doctor
 
03:14:13.030 --> 03:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
who has a child had a has a child who's
 
03:14:14.950 --> 03:14:14.960 align:start position:0%
now grown up she's
 
03:14:17.510 --> 03:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
how old is my son 36
 
03:14:19.510 --> 03:14:19.520 align:start position:0%
she had down syndrome
 
03:14:21.429 --> 03:14:21.439 align:start position:0%
they did not abort
 
03:14:25.110 --> 03:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
she had a healthy birth but she had down
 
03:14:27.830 --> 03:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
syndrome so i don't consider that
 
03:14:29.830 --> 03:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
incompatible with life
 
03:14:32.389 --> 03:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
what i'm talking about are those
 
03:14:32.399 --> 03:14:33.990 align:start position:0%
what i'm talking about are those
situations

03:14:33.990 --> 03:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
situations
 
03:14:36.070 --> 03:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
where medically they will tell you if
 
03:14:39.349 --> 03:14:39.359 align:start position:0%
the child has this chromosomal their
 
03:14:41.110 --> 03:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
life expectancy
 
03:14:42.150 --> 03:14:42.160 align:start position:0%
may be
 
03:14:44.070 --> 03:14:44.080 align:start position:0%
so short that they don't survive out of
 
03:14:45.269 --> 03:14:45.279 align:start position:0%
the womb
 
03:14:45.279 --> 03:14:46.550 align:start position:0%
the womb
and

03:14:46.550 --> 03:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:14:48.630 --> 03:14:48.640 align:start position:0%
they may be three to four days
 
03:14:50.389 --> 03:14:50.399 align:start position:0%
outside of the womb
 
03:14:53.030 --> 03:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
but the key question here
 
03:14:53.040 --> 03:14:54.870 align:start position:0%
but the key question here
is

03:14:54.870 --> 03:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:14:56.710 --> 03:14:56.720 align:start position:0%
is it up to me
 
03:15:00.389 --> 03:15:00.399 align:start position:0%
to decide is it up to you to decide
 
03:15:02.229 --> 03:15:02.239 align:start position:0%
whether this child
 
03:15:06.870 --> 03:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
should live or be allowed to die or
 
03:15:06.880 --> 03:15:09.110 align:start position:0%
should live or be allowed to die or
survive

03:15:09.110 --> 03:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
survive
 
03:15:12.309 --> 03:15:12.319 align:start position:0%
by the mother's actions or non-actions
 
03:15:16.070 --> 03:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
so i don't think that i or you or any of
 
03:15:18.469 --> 03:15:18.479 align:start position:0%
us in this room should be making that
 
03:15:18.479 --> 03:15:19.590 align:start position:0%
us in this room should be making that
decision

03:15:19.590 --> 03:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
decision
 
03:15:21.750 --> 03:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
somebody comes up and a chromosome test
 
03:15:23.750 --> 03:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
shows that they're not going to make it
 
03:15:25.429 --> 03:15:25.439 align:start position:0%
that is the mother
 
03:15:27.670 --> 03:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
the father
 
03:15:27.680 --> 03:15:31.030 align:start position:0%
the father
and

03:15:31.030 --> 03:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:35.190 --> 03:15:35.200 align:start position:0%
again possibly the clergy so that's
 
03:15:36.790 --> 03:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
that's where i'm coming from there are
 
03:15:39.429 --> 03:15:39.439 align:start position:0%
definitions i mean somebody told me
 
03:15:41.349 --> 03:15:41.359 align:start position:0%
about something called
 
03:15:41.359 --> 03:15:44.229 align:start position:0%
about something called
uh

03:15:44.229 --> 03:15:44.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:46.630 --> 03:15:46.640 align:start position:0%
can we go to dr conner for dr
 
03:15:48.389 --> 03:15:48.399 align:start position:0%
representative conner for a moment
 
03:15:49.830 --> 03:15:49.840 align:start position:0%
because he may be able to help us out
 
03:15:52.950 --> 03:15:52.960 align:start position:0%
with a definitional issue
 
03:15:54.950 --> 03:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
this is precisely why we should not be
 
03:15:57.910 --> 03:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
legislating the practice of medicine
 
03:15:59.670 --> 03:15:59.680 align:start position:0%
which is what this bill of all the
 
03:16:00.950 --> 03:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
original did
 
03:16:02.469 --> 03:16:02.479 align:start position:0%
and what representative wolf was trying
 
03:16:04.550 --> 03:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
to get it back to the doctor and the
 
03:16:06.469 --> 03:16:06.479 align:start position:0%
patient to make a decision
 
03:16:08.550 --> 03:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
based on our best science
 
03:16:11.190 --> 03:16:11.200 align:start position:0%
it is correct doctors are not always
 
03:16:11.200 --> 03:16:12.630 align:start position:0%
it is correct doctors are not always
perfect

03:16:12.630 --> 03:16:12.640 align:start position:0%
perfect
 
03:16:15.429 --> 03:16:15.439 align:start position:0%
i had errors we all do but we do the
 
03:16:17.030 --> 03:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
best we can and these can be very
 
03:16:18.630 --> 03:16:18.640 align:start position:0%
confusing i don't think there's a single
 
03:16:20.389 --> 03:16:20.399 align:start position:0%
practitioner who would say down syndrome
 
03:16:22.469 --> 03:16:22.479 align:start position:0%
is a fatal fetal anomaly if it isn't
 
03:16:23.750 --> 03:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
there are a few things that may shorten
 
03:16:25.670 --> 03:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
the life a bit where we're talking about
 
03:16:25.680 --> 03:16:27.349 align:start position:0%
the life a bit where we're talking about
decades

03:16:27.349 --> 03:16:27.359 align:start position:0%
decades
 
03:16:29.429 --> 03:16:29.439 align:start position:0%
uh severe chondroid dystrophies are ones
 
03:16:31.990 --> 03:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
where the bones simply don't form right
 
03:16:33.830 --> 03:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
the chest can't support respiration as
 
03:16:35.030 --> 03:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
soon as you're born you're going to die
 
03:16:36.790 --> 03:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
within a very short time
 
03:16:38.550 --> 03:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
and encephalitis which most of us became
 
03:16:40.389 --> 03:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
familiar with when zika came around
 
03:16:41.670 --> 03:16:41.680 align:start position:0%
where the that was just actually
 
03:16:43.269 --> 03:16:43.279 align:start position:0%
microcephaly banana encephalitis where
 
03:16:45.349 --> 03:16:45.359 align:start position:0%
there is no brain
 
03:16:48.950 --> 03:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
and i mean none and as a result it's not
 
03:16:50.790 --> 03:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
going to live the comment was made about
 
03:16:52.389 --> 03:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
chromosomal abnormalities we have to be
 
03:16:54.229 --> 03:16:54.239 align:start position:0%
a bit careful currently on the market
 
03:16:55.910 --> 03:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
there are a whole bunch of companies
 
03:16:55.920 --> 03:16:57.590 align:start position:0%
there are a whole bunch of companies
pushing

03:16:57.590 --> 03:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
pushing
 
03:16:57.600 --> 03:16:58.710 align:start position:0%
pushing
testing

03:16:58.710 --> 03:16:58.720 align:start position:0%
testing
 
03:17:01.429 --> 03:17:01.439 align:start position:0%
for chromosomal deletions and the false
 
03:17:03.190 --> 03:17:03.200 align:start position:0%
positive rate exceeds
 
03:17:05.510 --> 03:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
the true positive rate
 
03:17:07.750 --> 03:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
but these are rare
 
03:17:10.550 --> 03:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
people who end up with a diagnosis of
 
03:17:11.670 --> 03:17:11.680 align:start position:0%
this that are going to consider
 
03:17:14.950 --> 03:17:14.960 align:start position:0%
termination get into very specific
 
03:17:16.710 --> 03:17:16.720 align:start position:0%
high-quality obstetrical high-risk
 
03:17:18.790 --> 03:17:18.800 align:start position:0%
obstetrical practices such as dartmouth
 
03:17:21.429 --> 03:17:21.439 align:start position:0%
and i think elliott
 
03:17:22.870 --> 03:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
at that point they're not going to rely
 
03:17:24.870 --> 03:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
on some simple over-the-counter test
 
03:17:27.190 --> 03:17:27.200 align:start position:0%
that gets done they're going to do a lot
 
03:17:28.790 --> 03:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
more work to try to really sort out
 
03:17:30.229 --> 03:17:30.239 align:start position:0%
what's going on some of them can be
 
03:17:31.590 --> 03:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
quite obvious
 
03:17:33.830 --> 03:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
uh with repeated ultrasounds to look at
 
03:17:35.590 --> 03:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
the development
 
03:17:37.269 --> 03:17:37.279 align:start position:0%
some of them can be really quite
 
03:17:37.279 --> 03:17:39.030 align:start position:0%
some of them can be really quite
clear-cut

03:17:39.030 --> 03:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
clear-cut
 
03:17:40.630 --> 03:17:40.640 align:start position:0%
chromosomal abnormalities but those are
 
03:17:41.830 --> 03:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
usually not going to be done on just a
 
03:17:44.229 --> 03:17:44.239 align:start position:0%
blood draw which is what these current
 
03:17:46.469 --> 03:17:46.479 align:start position:0%
things are that are not very reliable
 
03:17:47.990 --> 03:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
they would go through a process of
 
03:17:49.990 --> 03:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
making sure that the diagnosis is
 
03:17:50.000 --> 03:17:51.190 align:start position:0%
making sure that the diagnosis is
correct

03:17:51.190 --> 03:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
correct
 
03:17:53.670 --> 03:17:53.680 align:start position:0%
but the bottom line is that's medicine
 
03:17:55.590 --> 03:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of things in medicine
 
03:17:57.190 --> 03:17:57.200 align:start position:0%
that we don't define with absolute
 
03:17:59.110 --> 03:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
precision because there's a gradation
 
03:18:01.030 --> 03:18:01.040 align:start position:0%
and we have to make a decision
 
03:18:02.550 --> 03:18:02.560 align:start position:0%
whether that
 
03:18:05.269 --> 03:18:05.279 align:start position:0%
fetus may survive for one hour or may
 
03:18:07.190 --> 03:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
survive for one week
 
03:18:08.389 --> 03:18:08.399 align:start position:0%
you know we could try to set something
 
03:18:09.830 --> 03:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
arbitrary it's like we put people in
 
03:18:11.269 --> 03:18:11.279 align:start position:0%
hospice we often say it's supposed to be
 
03:18:12.710 --> 03:18:12.720 align:start position:0%
a life expectancy less than six weeks
 
03:18:14.790 --> 03:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
well sometimes it lasts eight weeks but
 
03:18:16.150 --> 03:18:16.160 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean that we were in error
 
03:18:18.309 --> 03:18:18.319 align:start position:0%
we did the best we could the key is to
 
03:18:20.229 --> 03:18:20.239 align:start position:0%
leave the practice of medicine
 
03:18:21.590 --> 03:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
in medicine
 
03:18:26.150 --> 03:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:28.150 --> 03:18:28.160 align:start position:0%
thank you um and
 
03:18:29.910 --> 03:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
i don't know if you'll be surprised but
 
03:18:32.150 --> 03:18:32.160 align:start position:0%
but you and i actually share a great
 
03:18:35.110 --> 03:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
deal of agreement on this i i don't want
 
03:18:37.110 --> 03:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
the legislature practicing medicine
 
03:18:39.030 --> 03:18:39.040 align:start position:0%
that's why we have smart people going to
 
03:18:41.269 --> 03:18:41.279 align:start position:0%
med school
 
03:18:43.830 --> 03:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
but but what we've done
 
03:18:44.790 --> 03:18:44.800 align:start position:0%
i think
 
03:18:48.229 --> 03:18:48.239 align:start position:0%
in the essence of this 24 week
 
03:18:48.239 --> 03:18:49.349 align:start position:0%
in the essence of this 24 week
period

03:18:49.349 --> 03:18:49.359 align:start position:0%
period
 
03:18:52.469 --> 03:18:52.479 align:start position:0%
is to recognize the state's interest
 
03:18:54.950 --> 03:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
in protecting the constitutional rights
 
03:18:58.229 --> 03:18:58.239 align:start position:0%
of of a human after 24 weeks
 
03:19:00.950 --> 03:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
we've declared that person a human
 
03:19:00.960 --> 03:19:01.750 align:start position:0%
we've declared that person a human
and

03:19:01.750 --> 03:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:19:05.190 --> 03:19:05.200 align:start position:0%
that person then is entitled to the same
 
03:19:09.190 --> 03:19:09.200 align:start position:0%
defenses that any human would be uh
 
03:19:12.870 --> 03:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
to make a avail to themselves
 
03:19:15.269 --> 03:19:15.279 align:start position:0%
but the state even has a greater duty
 
03:19:16.870 --> 03:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
because these are
 
03:19:19.269 --> 03:19:19.279 align:start position:0%
innocents that are unable to protect
 
03:19:21.349 --> 03:19:21.359 align:start position:0%
themselves and so the state interest in
 
03:19:24.150 --> 03:19:24.160 align:start position:0%
protecting that life
 
03:19:24.160 --> 03:19:25.030 align:start position:0%
protecting that life
put

03:19:25.030 --> 03:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
put
 
03:19:27.030 --> 03:19:27.040 align:start position:0%
pushes us a little bit into that
 
03:19:27.040 --> 03:19:28.229 align:start position:0%
pushes us a little bit into that
envelope

03:19:28.229 --> 03:19:28.239 align:start position:0%
envelope
 
03:19:28.239 --> 03:19:29.510 align:start position:0%
envelope
and

03:19:29.510 --> 03:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:19:32.870 --> 03:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
i i do agree with you and i agree with
 
03:19:34.630 --> 03:19:34.640 align:start position:0%
representative wolf
 
03:19:34.640 --> 03:19:35.510 align:start position:0%
representative wolf
that

03:19:35.510 --> 03:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:19:35.520 --> 03:19:36.469 align:start position:0%
that
um

03:19:36.469 --> 03:19:36.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:19:39.670 --> 03:19:39.680 align:start position:0%
if we if we there was a fetal anomaly
 
03:19:42.710 --> 03:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
that is incompatible with life
 
03:19:45.269 --> 03:19:45.279 align:start position:0%
i'd i'd be open to
 
03:19:47.269 --> 03:19:47.279 align:start position:0%
adding that to the reasons why you could
 
03:19:50.150 --> 03:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
have an abortion after 24 weeks i i
 
03:19:51.269 --> 03:19:51.279 align:start position:0%
think it's
 
03:19:52.229 --> 03:19:52.239 align:start position:0%
it's just
 
03:19:55.830 --> 03:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
wrong to insist that a a mom carry a
 
03:19:55.840 --> 03:19:57.510 align:start position:0%
wrong to insist that a a mom carry a
baby

03:19:57.510 --> 03:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
baby
 
03:20:00.389 --> 03:20:00.399 align:start position:0%
longer just knowing that it's probably
 
03:20:00.399 --> 03:20:01.590 align:start position:0%
longer just knowing that it's probably
terminal

03:20:01.590 --> 03:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
terminal
 
03:20:03.190 --> 03:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
i just um
 
03:20:05.990 --> 03:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
because i'm a little cynical when it
 
03:20:08.070 --> 03:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
comes to the motives of people who make
 
03:20:11.030 --> 03:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
their profession on
 
03:20:11.040 --> 03:20:12.150 align:start position:0%
their profession on
abortion

03:20:12.150 --> 03:20:12.160 align:start position:0%
abortion
 
03:20:14.389 --> 03:20:14.399 align:start position:0%
i don't have a great deal of trust
 
03:20:15.510 --> 03:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
for them
 
03:20:18.950 --> 03:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
so i i just would want to try
 
03:20:20.870 --> 03:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
and if i'm asking you to help me out on
 
03:20:23.890 --> 03:20:23.900 align:start position:0%
this is if there's a way for us to
 
03:20:23.900 --> 03:20:25.670 align:start position:0%
this is if there's a way for us to
[Music]

03:20:25.670 --> 03:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:20:27.110 --> 03:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
make it clear
 
03:20:27.120 --> 03:20:28.630 align:start position:0%
make it clear
because

03:20:28.630 --> 03:20:28.640 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:20:31.110 --> 03:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
this language doesn't it seems to me a
 
03:20:33.510 --> 03:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
little ambiguous and a little subject to
 
03:20:35.429 --> 03:20:35.439 align:start position:0%
interpretation that i'm not comfortable
 
03:20:35.439 --> 03:20:36.309 align:start position:0%
interpretation that i'm not comfortable
with

03:20:36.309 --> 03:20:36.319 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:20:39.590 --> 03:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
fetal anomaly incompatible with life if
 
03:20:41.590 --> 03:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
we could if we could figure out how to
 
03:20:43.510 --> 03:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
add it to a definition section or
 
03:20:45.429 --> 03:20:45.439 align:start position:0%
somethings to say what's in and what's
 
03:20:47.750 --> 03:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
out what's permissible and what wouldn't
 
03:20:50.229 --> 03:20:50.239 align:start position:0%
be as by way of example but not by an
 
03:20:51.830 --> 03:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
exhaustive list
 
03:20:54.229 --> 03:20:54.239 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing would i i think would
 
03:20:57.510 --> 03:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
be persuasive to me as an individual yes
 
03:20:59.910 --> 03:20:59.920 align:start position:0%
may i respond i i
 
03:21:01.750 --> 03:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
sort of take offense about saying people
 
03:21:03.349 --> 03:21:03.359 align:start position:0%
who make their living on abortion these
 
03:21:03.359 --> 03:21:04.309 align:start position:0%
who make their living on abortion these
people

03:21:04.309 --> 03:21:04.319 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:21:07.110 --> 03:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
the number of terminations secondary to
 
03:21:09.030 --> 03:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
fatal fetal anomaly
 
03:21:10.469 --> 03:21:10.479 align:start position:0%
is probably
 
03:21:12.150 --> 03:21:12.160 align:start position:0%
could be counted on one hand per year
 
03:21:15.269 --> 03:21:15.279 align:start position:0%
it's a very rare phenomena
 
03:21:16.550 --> 03:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
and it is
 
03:21:18.150 --> 03:21:18.160 align:start position:0%
not the major practice of these
 
03:21:19.670 --> 03:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
individuals they're high-risk
 
03:21:22.070 --> 03:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
obstetricians who usually
 
03:21:24.309 --> 03:21:24.319 align:start position:0%
are managing to get these very difficult
 
03:21:26.870 --> 03:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
situations through to term
 
03:21:30.150 --> 03:21:30.160 align:start position:0%
with a surviving infant that's the goal
 
03:21:34.950 --> 03:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:37.830 --> 03:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
just like we try to save a kid who gets
 
03:21:38.870 --> 03:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
run over
 
03:21:41.429 --> 03:21:41.439 align:start position:0%
by a car and is basically brain dead we
 
03:21:43.349 --> 03:21:43.359 align:start position:0%
do everything we can to save them but if
 
03:21:47.110 --> 03:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
that kid is completely brain dead
 
03:21:48.870 --> 03:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
and the parents say yes i agree with
 
03:21:50.150 --> 03:21:50.160 align:start position:0%
termination of
 
03:21:52.950 --> 03:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
life support systems they're making a
 
03:21:55.110 --> 03:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
decision for another person who is
 
03:21:57.590 --> 03:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
somewhat helpless at that point in time
 
03:21:59.990 --> 03:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
it is not a sign of failure it is not a
 
03:22:01.590 --> 03:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
sign that we were making our living by
 
03:22:03.590 --> 03:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
letting this kid die it's a sign that
 
03:22:05.429 --> 03:22:05.439 align:start position:0%
sometimes we cannot
 
03:22:07.590 --> 03:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
work miracles
 
03:22:10.229 --> 03:22:10.239 align:start position:0%
we do the best we can
 
03:22:11.590 --> 03:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
this is a very small amount of a
 
03:22:13.030 --> 03:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
practice would be a termination of
 
03:22:14.870 --> 03:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
pregnancy for a fatal fetal anomaly the
 
03:22:17.190 --> 03:22:17.200 align:start position:0%
great majority they're going to bring to
 
03:22:19.429 --> 03:22:19.439 align:start position:0%
term successfully
 
03:22:21.269 --> 03:22:21.279 align:start position:0%
or with maybe some problems the kid
 
03:22:22.950 --> 03:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
might still have
 
03:22:25.429 --> 03:22:25.439 align:start position:0%
but they'll do their best
 
03:22:27.269 --> 03:22:27.279 align:start position:0%
this is why we should be trying to
 
03:22:28.790 --> 03:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
practice medicine
 
03:22:31.110 --> 03:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
in the legislature
 
03:22:32.550 --> 03:22:32.560 align:start position:0%
so i think we're still
 
03:22:35.110 --> 03:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
almost entirely agreed with one another
 
03:22:37.269 --> 03:22:37.279 align:start position:0%
and i've made a request are you able to
 
03:22:38.309 --> 03:22:38.319 align:start position:0%
help me
 
03:22:40.870 --> 03:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
come up with some sort of a definition
 
03:22:43.349 --> 03:22:43.359 align:start position:0%
to further clarify the
 
03:22:45.030 --> 03:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire's position
 
03:22:47.830 --> 03:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
relative to what we consider appropriate
 
03:22:50.790 --> 03:22:50.800 align:start position:0%
and inappropriate uses of this clause
 
03:22:52.870 --> 03:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
i think that would be extremely
 
03:22:55.190 --> 03:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
difficult because again
 
03:22:57.110 --> 03:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
the truth
 
03:22:59.110 --> 03:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
trying to make lists or can be difficult
 
03:23:00.630 --> 03:23:00.640 align:start position:0%
things can change some things that were
 
03:23:03.349 --> 03:23:03.359 align:start position:0%
not survivable 10 years ago are now
 
03:23:05.429 --> 03:23:05.439 align:start position:0%
which is the practice of medicine
 
03:23:07.269 --> 03:23:07.279 align:start position:0%
constantly evolves
 
03:23:07.279 --> 03:23:08.389 align:start position:0%
constantly evolves
and

03:23:08.389 --> 03:23:08.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:23:10.870 --> 03:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
i think again if we make a list we are
 
03:23:12.630 --> 03:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
practicing medicine
 
03:23:14.790 --> 03:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
we are saying these are things that
 
03:23:14.800 --> 03:23:15.750 align:start position:0%
we are saying these are things that
are

03:23:15.750 --> 03:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:23:17.830 --> 03:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
you know blah blah blah no it's a
 
03:23:19.830 --> 03:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
judgment of the treating physician if
 
03:23:22.070 --> 03:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
that treating physician
 
03:23:24.309 --> 03:23:24.319 align:start position:0%
is wrong
 
03:23:25.910 --> 03:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
they're going to face their board of
 
03:23:25.920 --> 03:23:28.309 align:start position:0%
they're going to face their board of
medicine

03:23:28.309 --> 03:23:28.319 align:start position:0%
medicine
 
03:23:30.710 --> 03:23:30.720 align:start position:0%
so ultimately representative wolf you're
 
03:23:32.150 --> 03:23:32.160 align:start position:0%
going to have to determine what your
 
03:23:34.870 --> 03:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
amendment looks like
 
03:23:37.910 --> 03:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
yes i would i'm happy
 
03:23:39.750 --> 03:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
not happy but i'm willing to go ahead
 
03:23:41.750 --> 03:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
and proceed on this i'd like to just
 
03:23:42.950 --> 03:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
back up
 
03:23:45.590 --> 03:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
a minute
 
03:23:47.190 --> 03:23:47.200 align:start position:0%
to let people know
 
03:23:49.950 --> 03:23:49.960 align:start position:0%
why we're before this committee
 
03:23:49.960 --> 03:23:51.510 align:start position:0%
why we're before this committee
1609

03:23:51.510 --> 03:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
1609
 
03:23:53.590 --> 03:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
got through the house
 
03:23:55.590 --> 03:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
but it went to a second committee
 
03:23:58.070 --> 03:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
because there's a very very small
 
03:23:58.080 --> 03:23:59.349 align:start position:0%
because there's a very very small
financial

03:23:59.349 --> 03:23:59.359 align:start position:0%
financial
 
03:24:02.150 --> 03:24:02.160 align:start position:0%
question in there
 
03:24:05.349 --> 03:24:05.359 align:start position:0%
the that whole section that relates to
 
03:24:07.110 --> 03:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
the financial question that brought us
 
03:24:10.229 --> 03:24:10.239 align:start position:0%
before you and your committee
 
03:24:12.710 --> 03:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
was because some of my friends
 
03:24:15.030 --> 03:24:15.040 align:start position:0%
who are in the pro-life community
 
03:24:17.429 --> 03:24:17.439 align:start position:0%
said we don't know how many abortions
 
03:24:19.670 --> 03:24:19.680 align:start position:0%
there are they're our ex
 
03:24:21.590 --> 03:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
and when i talk to the people at the
 
03:24:25.670 --> 03:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
various hospitals they say they're a why
 
03:24:29.030 --> 03:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
so we put in a reporting requirement
 
03:24:31.429 --> 03:24:31.439 align:start position:0%
so that we could all know
 
03:24:31.439 --> 03:24:32.229 align:start position:0%
so that we could all know
as

03:24:32.229 --> 03:24:32.239 align:start position:0%
as
 
03:24:35.670 --> 03:24:35.680 align:start position:0%
representative connor just said is it 5
 
03:24:39.910 --> 03:24:39.920 align:start position:0%
is it 25 or is it 2 and is it a weird
 
03:24:41.429 --> 03:24:41.439 align:start position:0%
minimal thing
 
03:24:43.269 --> 03:24:43.279 align:start position:0%
and that brought us
 
03:24:45.990 --> 03:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
before you and i'm glad for this
 
03:24:48.070 --> 03:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
committee to understand
 
03:24:50.309 --> 03:24:50.319 align:start position:0%
that i'm not and was never throughout
 
03:24:52.710 --> 03:24:52.720 align:start position:0%
this bill looking to hide
 
03:24:57.030 --> 03:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
we wanted it all open and transparent
 
03:24:58.870 --> 03:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
let's start with finding out how many
 
03:25:01.510 --> 03:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
abortions there may have been after 24
 
03:25:01.520 --> 03:25:02.790 align:start position:0%
abortions there may have been after 24
weeks

03:25:02.790 --> 03:25:02.800 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
03:25:05.269 --> 03:25:05.279 align:start position:0%
do we have a situation where there
 
03:25:08.229 --> 03:25:08.239 align:start position:0%
has to be action taken or is it two or
 
03:25:08.239 --> 03:25:09.269 align:start position:0%
has to be action taken or is it two or
three

03:25:09.269 --> 03:25:09.279 align:start position:0%
three
 
03:25:12.150 --> 03:25:12.160 align:start position:0%
fetal abnormalities incompatible with
 
03:25:14.389 --> 03:25:14.399 align:start position:0%
life that's what brought us before this
 
03:25:14.399 --> 03:25:16.469 align:start position:0%
life that's what brought us before this
committee

03:25:16.469 --> 03:25:16.479 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:25:19.990 --> 03:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
so so i i understand that and i agree
 
03:25:22.469 --> 03:25:22.479 align:start position:0%
with that um are you proposing that you
 
03:25:24.469 --> 03:25:24.479 align:start position:0%
would have a uh in your amendment
 
03:25:27.269 --> 03:25:27.279 align:start position:0%
something to do to change the reporting
 
03:25:27.279 --> 03:25:28.389 align:start position:0%
something to do to change the reporting
requirement

03:25:28.389 --> 03:25:28.399 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
03:25:30.150 --> 03:25:30.160 align:start position:0%
i'm just curious i'm being i'm trying to
 
03:25:32.309 --> 03:25:32.319 align:start position:0%
be clear
 
03:25:35.910 --> 03:25:35.920 align:start position:0%
i'd look to your suggestion i'm happy
 
03:25:38.870 --> 03:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
that we get as much information as
 
03:25:41.190 --> 03:25:41.200 align:start position:0%
possible on this
 
03:25:42.469 --> 03:25:42.479 align:start position:0%
do it does it
 
03:25:44.229 --> 03:25:44.239 align:start position:0%
do we make it a law and
 
03:25:45.670 --> 03:25:45.680 align:start position:0%
nothing coming out of the state i don't
 
03:25:47.590 --> 03:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
know how you do that but i think we
 
03:25:49.590 --> 03:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
should have as much information as
 
03:25:51.110 --> 03:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
possible yeah
 
03:25:53.830 --> 03:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
two you may know two terms ago we had a
 
03:25:56.550 --> 03:25:56.560 align:start position:0%
bill uh in the house to
 
03:25:56.560 --> 03:25:59.030 align:start position:0%
bill uh in the house to
consider

03:25:59.030 --> 03:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:01.349 --> 03:26:01.359 align:start position:0%
accumulating abortion statistics and i
 
03:26:03.030 --> 03:26:03.040 align:start position:0%
was defeated
 
03:26:05.590 --> 03:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
so we would have had the data had we
 
03:26:07.110 --> 03:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
passed that bill
 
03:26:08.229 --> 03:26:08.239 align:start position:0%
there are
 
03:26:10.550 --> 03:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
some statistics that are kept and i've
 
03:26:14.710 --> 03:26:14.720 align:start position:0%
seen them i've lost that thing but uh
 
03:26:17.510 --> 03:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
there are statistics out there okay
 
03:26:20.389 --> 03:26:20.399 align:start position:0%
so so can i move on to the health issue
 
03:26:20.399 --> 03:26:21.990 align:start position:0%
so so can i move on to the health issue
sure

03:26:21.990 --> 03:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
sure
 
03:26:22.000 --> 03:26:23.750 align:start position:0%
sure
um

03:26:23.750 --> 03:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:26:26.950 --> 03:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
so currently the uh one of the
 
03:26:29.030 --> 03:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
exceptions exists
 
03:26:29.040 --> 03:26:30.070 align:start position:0%
exceptions exists
for

03:26:30.070 --> 03:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:26:32.630 --> 03:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
um the life of the mother and then i
 
03:26:34.630 --> 03:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
think there are like four
 
03:26:37.510 --> 03:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
sub sub categories of things that would
 
03:26:39.830 --> 03:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
uh indicate whether or not a life is at
 
03:26:41.750 --> 03:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
risk to include
 
03:26:44.070 --> 03:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:46.710 --> 03:26:46.720 align:start position:0%
problems with physical health
 
03:26:49.590 --> 03:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
so um when if we were to simply add the
 
03:26:49.600 --> 03:26:50.710 align:start position:0%
so um when if we were to simply add the
word

03:26:50.710 --> 03:26:50.720 align:start position:0%
word
 
03:26:52.630 --> 03:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
health or life
 
03:26:54.469 --> 03:26:54.479 align:start position:0%
what the concerns are there that i'd
 
03:26:55.750 --> 03:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
want to
 
03:26:55.760 --> 03:26:57.030 align:start position:0%
want to
mitigate

03:26:57.030 --> 03:26:57.040 align:start position:0%
mitigate
 
03:27:00.630 --> 03:27:00.640 align:start position:0%
uh would be um
 
03:27:05.510 --> 03:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:08.070 --> 03:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
common things that are true with any
 
03:27:08.080 --> 03:27:09.190 align:start position:0%
common things that are true with any
parent

03:27:09.190 --> 03:27:09.200 align:start position:0%
parent
 
03:27:11.349 --> 03:27:11.359 align:start position:0%
parents get stressed when they have kids
 
03:27:14.630 --> 03:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
at home stress can cause challenges to a
 
03:27:16.469 --> 03:27:16.479 align:start position:0%
person's health
 
03:27:16.479 --> 03:27:17.429 align:start position:0%
person's health
so

03:27:17.429 --> 03:27:17.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:27:20.710 --> 03:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
so when you add the if you if you wanted
 
03:27:23.030 --> 03:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
us to add the word health and as an
 
03:27:25.670 --> 03:27:25.680 align:start position:0%
exception to the 24 weeks
 
03:27:28.469 --> 03:27:28.479 align:start position:0%
would you help me understand
 
03:27:30.469 --> 03:27:30.479 align:start position:0%
how severe
 
03:27:32.469 --> 03:27:32.479 align:start position:0%
a woman's health would have to be at
 
03:27:32.479 --> 03:27:33.429 align:start position:0%
a woman's health would have to be at
risk

03:27:33.429 --> 03:27:33.439 align:start position:0%
risk
 
03:27:34.469 --> 03:27:34.479 align:start position:0%
for this
 
03:27:37.830 --> 03:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
exemption to be leveraged would
 
03:27:41.190 --> 03:27:41.200 align:start position:0%
the stress of raising a child be
 
03:27:42.950 --> 03:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
enough or
 
03:27:45.349 --> 03:27:45.359 align:start position:0%
and if that isn't enough then how would
 
03:27:50.070 --> 03:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:51.510 --> 03:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
i can't say
 
03:27:55.110 --> 03:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
that i came up with this on my own
 
03:27:58.150 --> 03:27:58.160 align:start position:0%
one of our republican representatives
 
03:28:00.550 --> 03:28:00.560 align:start position:0%
told me about a case called doe
 
03:28:02.269 --> 03:28:02.279 align:start position:0%
versus bolton
 
03:28:05.510 --> 03:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
1973 u.s supreme court
 
03:28:07.110 --> 03:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
its definition
 
03:28:09.510 --> 03:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
of the health it's a georgia case
 
03:28:11.269 --> 03:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
includes quote
 
03:28:13.750 --> 03:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
all factors physical emotional
 
03:28:17.190 --> 03:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
psychological familial and women's age
 
03:28:18.950 --> 03:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
relevant to the well-being of the
 
03:28:18.960 --> 03:28:20.309 align:start position:0%
relevant to the well-being of the
patient

03:28:20.309 --> 03:28:20.319 align:start position:0%
patient
 
03:28:22.710 --> 03:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
it's a supreme court case
 
03:28:28.229 --> 03:28:28.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:30.950 --> 03:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
i know that that may sound wide open to
 
03:28:34.389 --> 03:28:34.399 align:start position:0%
you but that is what the law has been
 
03:28:36.790 --> 03:28:36.800 align:start position:0%
for the last
 
03:28:38.630 --> 03:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
61 years
 
03:28:41.190 --> 03:28:41.200 align:start position:0%
51 years
 
03:28:45.349 --> 03:28:45.359 align:start position:0%
okay so you you said you'd be open to uh
 
03:28:47.190 --> 03:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
an amendment to where you would
 
03:28:50.630 --> 03:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
eliminate rape and incest as as
 
03:28:53.510 --> 03:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
exemptions for the 24 weeks
 
03:28:57.190 --> 03:28:57.200 align:start position:0%
just curious what your thinking is there
 
03:28:59.269 --> 03:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
i had a lot of discussions with a lot of
 
03:29:00.950 --> 03:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
people about that and one of the
 
03:29:04.150 --> 03:29:04.160 align:start position:0%
overriding concerns has been
 
03:29:04.160 --> 03:29:04.830 align:start position:0%
overriding concerns has been
an

03:29:04.830 --> 03:29:04.840 align:start position:0%
an
 
03:29:07.110 --> 03:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
individual a mother
 
03:29:08.550 --> 03:29:08.560 align:start position:0%
should know
 
03:29:10.469 --> 03:29:10.479 align:start position:0%
by 24 weeks
 
03:29:10.479 --> 03:29:12.150 align:start position:0%
by 24 weeks
whether

03:29:12.150 --> 03:29:12.160 align:start position:0%
whether
 
03:29:14.469 --> 03:29:14.479 align:start position:0%
they want to carry that baby
 
03:29:16.550 --> 03:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
to term
 
03:29:18.550 --> 03:29:18.560 align:start position:0%
i've had other instances where they've
 
03:29:21.750 --> 03:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
been a father that has kept her daughter
 
03:29:22.950 --> 03:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
his daughter
 
03:29:22.960 --> 03:29:24.630 align:start position:0%
his daughter
confined

03:29:24.630 --> 03:29:24.640 align:start position:0%
confined
 
03:29:26.710 --> 03:29:26.720 align:start position:0%
and that's why i put it in there
 
03:29:28.550 --> 03:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
or a rapist
 
03:29:30.710 --> 03:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
and a woman is struggling and struggling
 
03:29:32.309 --> 03:29:32.319 align:start position:0%
with the decision as to whether she
 
03:29:34.550 --> 03:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
wants to have that child
 
03:29:37.830 --> 03:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
so it was a difficult thing to say okay
 
03:29:39.750 --> 03:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
we'll eliminate that
 
03:29:42.950 --> 03:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
again i'd love to know the statistics
 
03:29:44.469 --> 03:29:44.479 align:start position:0%
how many
 
03:29:49.670 --> 03:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
cases of abortion occur after 24 weeks
 
03:29:51.590 --> 03:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
from rape or incest
 
03:29:54.630 --> 03:29:54.640 align:start position:0%
i don't think they're very many
 
03:29:56.550 --> 03:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
do you think it's reasonable to think
 
03:29:56.560 --> 03:29:57.590 align:start position:0%
do you think it's reasonable to think
that

03:29:57.590 --> 03:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:29:57.600 --> 03:29:58.550 align:start position:0%
that
um

03:29:58.550 --> 03:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:30:01.510 --> 03:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
a woman when when she becomes pregnant
 
03:30:04.389 --> 03:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
that moment she becomes pregnant she
 
03:30:06.950 --> 03:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
knows whether it's incest or sexual
 
03:30:10.469 --> 03:30:10.479 align:start position:0%
assault and then has 24 weeks
 
03:30:13.750 --> 03:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
to obtain an abortion for any reason
 
03:30:15.110 --> 03:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
do you do you think
 
03:30:19.030 --> 03:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
that's enough time to respond to
 
03:30:20.950 --> 03:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
the conditions where the pregnancy
 
03:30:24.790 --> 03:30:24.800 align:start position:0%
occurred in sexual assault or rape
 
03:30:27.110 --> 03:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
i would certainly hope so i would
 
03:30:28.630 --> 03:30:28.640 align:start position:0%
certainly hope
 
03:30:30.309 --> 03:30:30.319 align:start position:0%
that we in the state of new hampshire
 
03:30:33.190 --> 03:30:33.200 align:start position:0%
would give that woman the counseling
 
03:30:35.349 --> 03:30:35.359 align:start position:0%
that's needed to help her reach a
 
03:30:38.950 --> 03:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
decision that she's comfortable with
 
03:30:42.229 --> 03:30:42.239 align:start position:0%
okay so so let's let's go on to they
 
03:30:43.910 --> 03:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
like coming
 
03:30:46.309 --> 03:30:46.319 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you for stopping me go
 
03:30:49.670 --> 03:30:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:52.309 --> 03:30:52.319 align:start position:0%
in this in cases of incest particularly
 
03:30:54.469 --> 03:30:54.479 align:start position:0%
especially if it's a younger adolescent
 
03:30:54.479 --> 03:30:55.590 align:start position:0%
especially if it's a younger adolescent
female

03:30:55.590 --> 03:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
female
 
03:30:58.150 --> 03:30:58.160 align:start position:0%
who is often under the control
 
03:30:59.269 --> 03:30:59.279 align:start position:0%
of a
 
03:31:01.590 --> 03:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
older male
 
03:31:03.429 --> 03:31:03.439 align:start position:0%
family member
 
03:31:06.389 --> 03:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
they may not be allowed
 
03:31:09.429 --> 03:31:09.439 align:start position:0%
to access medical care
 
03:31:11.510 --> 03:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
until perhaps the neighbor says you look
 
03:31:14.150 --> 03:31:14.160 align:start position:0%
pregnant what the heck's going on
 
03:31:14.160 --> 03:31:15.349 align:start position:0%
pregnant what the heck's going on
likewise

03:31:15.349 --> 03:31:15.359 align:start position:0%
likewise
 
03:31:17.110 --> 03:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
they're often quite traumatized and have
 
03:31:18.950 --> 03:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
a great difficulty even trying to figure
 
03:31:20.550 --> 03:31:20.560 align:start position:0%
out to deal with this
 
03:31:22.469 --> 03:31:22.479 align:start position:0%
but the one that i think is most
 
03:31:23.910 --> 03:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
striking and
 
03:31:25.830 --> 03:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
most many people around here know i was
 
03:31:27.830 --> 03:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
not an obstetrician i was a spine
 
03:31:27.840 --> 03:31:29.990 align:start position:0%
not an obstetrician i was a spine
surgeon

03:31:29.990 --> 03:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
surgeon
 
03:31:31.750 --> 03:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
but i actually made a diagnosis of a
 
03:31:33.670 --> 03:31:33.680 align:start position:0%
post-24 week pregnancy and a woman who
 
03:31:35.349 --> 03:31:35.359 align:start position:0%
did not know she was pregnant i had a
 
03:31:37.190 --> 03:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
young woman who came in
 
03:31:39.510 --> 03:31:39.520 align:start position:0%
in the summer slender
 
03:31:42.229 --> 03:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
uh she had back pain as many women who
 
03:31:43.990 --> 03:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
were pregnant were but she did not know
 
03:31:45.429 --> 03:31:45.439 align:start position:0%
she was pregnant
 
03:31:47.030 --> 03:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
she looked slightly pregnant i actually
 
03:31:48.630 --> 03:31:48.640 align:start position:0%
had a medical resident telling me that
 
03:31:50.070 --> 03:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
day or shadowing me
 
03:31:51.990 --> 03:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
as we finished the history and we left
 
03:31:53.910 --> 03:31:53.920 align:start position:0%
out to the hall so she could change her
 
03:31:55.750 --> 03:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
clothes i said to marcie who is with me
 
03:31:58.469 --> 03:31:58.479 align:start position:0%
i said does she look pregnant she said
 
03:31:58.479 --> 03:31:59.670 align:start position:0%
i said does she look pregnant she said
sorta

03:31:59.670 --> 03:31:59.680 align:start position:0%
sorta
 
03:32:01.910 --> 03:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
we went back in on exam i examined her
 
03:32:03.990 --> 03:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
belly i could feel her uterus i hadn't
 
03:32:06.309 --> 03:32:06.319 align:start position:0%
done an obstetrical exam for decades but
 
03:32:08.389 --> 03:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
i could remember how to do it
 
03:32:09.830 --> 03:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
and i confronted her and asked her is
 
03:32:11.110 --> 03:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
there any chance she could be pregnant
 
03:32:12.630 --> 03:32:12.640 align:start position:0%
so well you know i really haven't had a
 
03:32:14.389 --> 03:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
period for a while but i just thought it
 
03:32:16.950 --> 03:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
was you know just how way it was
 
03:32:18.870 --> 03:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
and we did center for pregnancy testing
 
03:32:21.190 --> 03:32:21.200 align:start position:0%
it turns out she was post 24 weeks and
 
03:32:25.269 --> 03:32:25.279 align:start position:0%
she had no clue that she was pregnant
 
03:32:27.990 --> 03:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
so a victim in other she if she were not
 
03:32:29.349 --> 03:32:29.359 align:start position:0%
raped that would
 
03:32:31.590 --> 03:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
her incest that wouldn't qualify but if
 
03:32:33.910 --> 03:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
she had been a victim of rape or incest
 
03:32:35.349 --> 03:32:35.359 align:start position:0%
she wouldn't have even
 
03:32:35.359 --> 03:32:37.190 align:start position:0%
she wouldn't have even
known

03:32:37.190 --> 03:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
known
 
03:32:39.670 --> 03:32:39.680 align:start position:0%
and she obviously knew she was exposed
 
03:32:41.910 --> 03:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
uh but she did not think she was
 
03:32:44.070 --> 03:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
pregnant so the point is
 
03:32:45.429 --> 03:32:45.439 align:start position:0%
once again
 
03:32:46.950 --> 03:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
we're sitting here trying to parse this
 
03:32:49.269 --> 03:32:49.279 align:start position:0%
out and put ourselves in the sh in the
 
03:32:49.279 --> 03:32:50.550 align:start position:0%
out and put ourselves in the sh in the
shoes

03:32:50.550 --> 03:32:50.560 align:start position:0%
shoes
 
03:32:51.830 --> 03:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
well we're not putting ourselves in the
 
03:32:54.469 --> 03:32:54.479 align:start position:0%
shoes of a woman who has been raped or a
 
03:32:56.070 --> 03:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
victim of incest
 
03:32:57.990 --> 03:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
or did not have enough education to even
 
03:32:59.110 --> 03:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
be able to figure out that she's
 
03:32:59.120 --> 03:33:00.950 align:start position:0%
be able to figure out that she's
pregnant

03:33:00.950 --> 03:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
pregnant
 
03:33:03.030 --> 03:33:03.040 align:start position:0%
and i do understand the previous comment
 
03:33:05.670 --> 03:33:05.680 align:start position:0%
you made about deals but i still object
 
03:33:07.750 --> 03:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
to the fact that we are trying to parse
 
03:33:09.510 --> 03:33:09.520 align:start position:0%
out details of policy particularly
 
03:33:11.030 --> 03:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
medical issues
 
03:33:13.349 --> 03:33:13.359 align:start position:0%
in a non-policy committee this is why we
 
03:33:15.590 --> 03:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
have a policy committee which i serve on
 
03:33:18.150 --> 03:33:18.160 align:start position:0%
where we have a couple of docs nurses a
 
03:33:19.750 --> 03:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
whole number of other providers
 
03:33:21.349 --> 03:33:21.359 align:start position:0%
including mental health providers who
 
03:33:23.429 --> 03:33:23.439 align:start position:0%
deal with these kinds of problems
 
03:33:25.269 --> 03:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
and we worked on this
 
03:33:26.630 --> 03:33:26.640 align:start position:0%
and i
 
03:33:27.910 --> 03:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
really quite troubled that we're trying
 
03:33:30.469 --> 03:33:30.479 align:start position:0%
to revamp this here in this committee
 
03:33:32.790 --> 03:33:32.800 align:start position:0%
so representative knurk i'm i'm fully
 
03:33:34.710 --> 03:33:34.720 align:start position:0%
willing to
 
03:33:38.710 --> 03:33:38.720 align:start position:0%
not entertain any policy changes and and
 
03:33:41.030 --> 03:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
just go to a vote is that is that what
 
03:33:43.750 --> 03:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
your preference is that we that we not
 
03:33:45.750 --> 03:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
consider any policy changes and we just
 
03:33:48.389 --> 03:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
go to a vote
 
03:33:50.630 --> 03:33:50.640 align:start position:0%
i know that our side will lose but i'm
 
03:33:52.070 --> 03:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
certainly comfortable with that i think
 
03:33:53.670 --> 03:33:53.680 align:start position:0%
it's a more honest way for us to be
 
03:33:55.830 --> 03:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
doing business all right we're honest
 
03:33:55.840 --> 03:33:56.870 align:start position:0%
doing business all right we're honest
people

03:33:56.870 --> 03:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:33:58.229 --> 03:33:58.239 align:start position:0%
so so
 
03:34:00.710 --> 03:34:00.720 align:start position:0%
uh i'd like to take a straw vote at this
 
03:34:00.720 --> 03:34:01.750 align:start position:0%
uh i'd like to take a straw vote at this
point

03:34:01.750 --> 03:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
point
 
03:34:04.309 --> 03:34:04.319 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to ask two questions the
 
03:34:06.550 --> 03:34:06.560 align:start position:0%
first question is
 
03:34:09.429 --> 03:34:09.439 align:start position:0%
are you in favor of
 
03:34:12.830 --> 03:34:12.840 align:start position:0%
otp on hb
 
03:34:15.349 --> 03:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
1609 we'll have a show of hands if
 
03:34:17.269 --> 03:34:17.279 align:start position:0%
you're in favor of passing the bill as
 
03:34:17.279 --> 03:34:18.229 align:start position:0%
you're in favor of passing the bill as
is

03:34:18.229 --> 03:34:18.239 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:34:21.510 --> 03:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
and then we'll have a second vote
 
03:34:24.469 --> 03:34:24.479 align:start position:0%
on if you're in favor of itl
 
03:34:31.190 --> 03:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
h.b 1609 as is is is the question clear
 
03:34:34.790 --> 03:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
okay so if you are in favor of
 
03:34:39.269 --> 03:34:39.279 align:start position:0%
passing hb 1609 as is
 
03:34:41.750 --> 03:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
please raise your hand
 
03:34:46.870 --> 03:34:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:50.070 --> 03:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
okay so we have three um if you were in
 
03:34:54.309 --> 03:34:54.319 align:start position:0%
favor of itl hb 1609
 
03:35:00.790 --> 03:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:03.990 --> 03:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
okay so with a vote of four to three
 
03:35:05.670 --> 03:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
we'll send this to the full finance
 
03:35:10.790 --> 03:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:15.269 --> 03:35:15.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:17.750 --> 03:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
we're um i guess that's the committee's
 
03:35:17.760 --> 03:35:18.950 align:start position:0%
we're um i guess that's the committee's
decision

03:35:18.950 --> 03:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
decision
 
03:35:20.630 --> 03:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
that that's our decision so we're done
 
03:35:33.990 --> 03:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:34.000 --> 03:35:35.590 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:35:35.590 --> 03:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:35:37.510 --> 03:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
next up is
 
03:35:37.520 --> 03:35:38.870 align:start position:0%
next up is
hb

03:35:38.870 --> 03:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
hb
 
03:35:38.880 --> 03:35:40.790 align:start position:0%
hb
1622

03:35:40.790 --> 03:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
1622
 
03:35:43.110 --> 03:35:43.120 align:start position:0%
relative to notice that a health care
 
03:35:45.750 --> 03:35:45.760 align:start position:0%

03:35:47.920 --> 03:35:49.830 align:start position:0%

parity

03:35:49.830 --> 03:35:49.840 align:start position:0%
parity
 
03:35:52.469 --> 03:35:52.479 align:start position:0%
would you start us off mr ripple by
 
03:35:54.630 --> 03:35:54.640 align:start position:0%
giving us an update on the status of the
 
03:35:58.550 --> 03:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:01.750 --> 03:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
yes and i think this
 
03:36:03.830 --> 03:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
i think i sent out a revised fiscal note
 
03:36:05.830 --> 03:36:05.840 align:start position:0%
over the weekend for this one did i not
 
03:36:08.309 --> 03:36:08.319 align:start position:0%
if i can hand out a hard copy to anybody
 
03:36:09.750 --> 03:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
who needs one
 
03:36:12.150 --> 03:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
why don't you uh just also also i'm
 
03:36:13.750 --> 03:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
trying to get it into the record because
 
03:36:16.150 --> 03:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
we we're on the youtube channel too so
 
03:36:17.750 --> 03:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
if you could just let people know the
 
03:36:21.269 --> 03:36:21.279 align:start position:0%
status sure yep so basically um we sent
 
03:36:22.790 --> 03:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
this out to the insurance department who
 
03:36:25.190 --> 03:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
states that the uh bill has amended is
 
03:36:27.190 --> 03:36:27.200 align:start position:0%
will have no fiscal impact
 
03:36:29.190 --> 03:36:29.200 align:start position:0%
uh and hhs states that the bill is
 
03:36:32.229 --> 03:36:32.239 align:start position:0%
unlikely to have a fiscal impact unless
 
03:36:34.070 --> 03:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
they're ordered to increase medicaid
 
03:36:35.349 --> 03:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
managed care benefits to be in
 
03:36:37.429 --> 03:36:37.439 align:start position:0%
compliance with the parity provision and
 
03:36:38.950 --> 03:36:38.960 align:start position:0%
i did invite someone from the insurance
 
03:36:40.630 --> 03:36:40.640 align:start position:0%
department to be here to speak about the
 
03:36:42.389 --> 03:36:42.399 align:start position:0%
parity provision and that law generally
 
03:36:48.229 --> 03:36:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:49.830 --> 03:36:49.840 align:start position:0%
but the bottom line is there is no
 
03:36:52.070 --> 03:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact
 
03:36:53.910 --> 03:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
uh well as written there's unlikely to
 
03:36:55.590 --> 03:36:55.600 align:start position:0%
be a fiscal impact it's not a straight
 
03:36:57.269 --> 03:36:57.279 align:start position:0%
no fiscal impact like some of the other
 
03:36:59.590 --> 03:36:59.600 align:start position:0%
bills that you've had today
 
03:37:01.830 --> 03:37:01.840 align:start position:0%
all right so we'll ask the insurance
 
03:37:08.790 --> 03:37:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:11.030 --> 03:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
please state your name and title good
 
03:37:13.110 --> 03:37:13.120 align:start position:0%

03:37:29.030 --> 03:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
insurance life and health director with
 
03:37:36.630 --> 03:37:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:43.269 --> 03:37:43.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:43.279 --> 03:37:44.389 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:37:44.389 --> 03:37:44.399 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:37:44.399 --> 03:37:47.030 align:start position:0%
okay
so

03:37:47.030 --> 03:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:48.550 --> 03:37:48.560 align:start position:0%
i think
 
03:37:49.670 --> 03:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
i just want to under you're the
 
03:37:52.790 --> 03:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
insurance department right yes okay the
 
03:37:55.269 --> 03:37:55.279 align:start position:0%
fiscal note reads the insurance
 
03:37:57.670 --> 03:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
department states that this provision is
 
03:38:00.790 --> 03:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
expected to have no fiscal impact
 
03:38:02.229 --> 03:38:02.239 align:start position:0%
that is correct
 
03:38:04.870 --> 03:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
okay so it's the next sentence
 
03:38:06.550 --> 03:38:06.560 align:start position:0%
the department of health and human
 
03:38:09.030 --> 03:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
services states the bill is unlikely to
 
03:38:12.229 --> 03:38:12.239 align:start position:0%
have a fiscal impact so so what i think
 
03:38:14.389 --> 03:38:14.399 align:start position:0%
we probably need to do because your
 
03:38:17.590 --> 03:38:17.600 align:start position:0%
testimony is really clear from what we
 
03:38:20.550 --> 03:38:20.560 align:start position:0%
need to know uh is to ask the department
 
03:38:22.150 --> 03:38:22.160 align:start position:0%
of health and human services to come
 
03:38:24.070 --> 03:38:24.080 align:start position:0%
forward to talk about their
 
03:38:26.790 --> 03:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
part of the fiscal note okay do you i
 
03:38:27.910 --> 03:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
don't want to stop you though if you
 
03:38:29.910 --> 03:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
have something you want to say please do
 
03:38:31.830 --> 03:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
thanks i would just say it does change
 
03:38:33.990 --> 03:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
the commercial insurance statutes the
 
03:38:35.429 --> 03:38:35.439 align:start position:0%
managed care organizations that
 
03:38:37.510 --> 03:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
administer medicaid benefits are
 
03:38:39.189 --> 03:38:39.199 align:start position:0%
operated basically under a contract
 
03:38:41.910 --> 03:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
between dhhs and the mco the insurance
 
03:38:43.670 --> 03:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
department does license and look at
 
03:38:45.910 --> 03:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
solvency of the mcos but otherwise your
 
03:38:47.750 --> 03:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
insurance laws would not apply to your
 
03:38:50.710 --> 03:38:50.720 align:start position:0%
mcos so by changing just an insurance
 
03:38:53.030 --> 03:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
commercial insurance statute that is the
 
03:38:55.670 --> 03:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
limit of the impact of the bill
 
03:38:58.790 --> 03:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
so so that impact you're referring to
 
03:39:01.910 --> 03:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
the impact of on state dollars
 
03:39:04.710 --> 03:39:04.720 align:start position:0%
but if but for an mco are you implying
 
03:39:08.469 --> 03:39:08.479 align:start position:0%
that the mco would have added costs
 
03:39:10.950 --> 03:39:10.960 align:start position:0%
and and when they have added costs that
 
03:39:12.229 --> 03:39:12.239 align:start position:0%
they would be
 
03:39:14.469 --> 03:39:14.479 align:start position:0%
possibly or probably passed on and
 
03:39:16.790 --> 03:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
greater premiums so the only way that
 
03:39:18.389 --> 03:39:18.399 align:start position:0%
would be the case is if something in the
 
03:39:21.429 --> 03:39:21.439 align:start position:0%
contract between dhhs and the mco
 
03:39:23.030 --> 03:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
says that it must have that kind of
 
03:39:25.910 --> 03:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
impact because this legislative change
 
03:39:27.670 --> 03:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
only impacts the commercial insurance
 
03:39:29.910 --> 03:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
statutes that's where the impact is
 
03:39:33.110 --> 03:39:33.120 align:start position:0%
directly limited right
 
03:39:35.349 --> 03:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
all right thank you sure
 
03:39:40.710 --> 03:39:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:43.189 --> 03:39:43.199 align:start position:0%

03:40:16.950 --> 03:40:16.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:40:18.870 --> 03:40:18.880 align:start position:0%
uh so we agree with the insurance
 
03:40:22.150 --> 03:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:23.910 --> 03:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
analysis of the bill
 
03:40:26.229 --> 03:40:26.239 align:start position:0%
we're going to be submitting a corrected
 
03:40:27.990 --> 03:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal note
 
03:40:30.309 --> 03:40:30.319 align:start position:0%
essentially the bill is introduced had
 
03:40:31.910 --> 03:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
some provisions that did have an impact
 
03:40:34.550 --> 03:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
or potentially impacted hhs it seems
 
03:40:37.110 --> 03:40:37.120 align:start position:0%
that those
 
03:40:38.950 --> 03:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
that analysis got moved over into the
 
03:40:41.269 --> 03:40:41.279 align:start position:0%
amendment and the bill is amended
 
03:40:43.269 --> 03:40:43.279 align:start position:0%
so we'll be correcting that for the
 
03:40:43.279 --> 03:40:48.630 align:start position:0%
so we'll be correcting that for the
record

03:40:48.630 --> 03:40:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:50.710 --> 03:40:50.720 align:start position:0%
uh all right i'm i'm sorry i lost my
 
03:40:53.030 --> 03:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
train of thought for a second i i'm a
 
03:40:55.349 --> 03:40:55.359 align:start position:0%
simple one or a zero guy a former
 
03:40:57.110 --> 03:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
software engineer
 
03:40:59.429 --> 03:40:59.439 align:start position:0%
will will there be
 
03:41:01.670 --> 03:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
a fiscal impact no
 
03:41:03.030 --> 03:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
no no
 
03:41:05.269 --> 03:41:05.279 align:start position:0%
because in the write-up
 
03:41:07.110 --> 03:41:07.120 align:start position:0%
as i currently see it
 
03:41:09.590 --> 03:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
it's unlikely and are you
 
03:41:11.349 --> 03:41:11.359 align:start position:0%
striking the word unlikely and you're
 
03:41:13.189 --> 03:41:13.199 align:start position:0%
saying no correct
 
03:41:15.110 --> 03:41:15.120 align:start position:0%
we it's a it's a holdover from the bill
 
03:41:17.110 --> 03:41:17.120 align:start position:0%
as introduced which did have potentially
 
03:41:18.950 --> 03:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
a fiscal impact when we submitted the
 
03:41:20.950 --> 03:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
fiscal note that provision just got
 
03:41:23.590 --> 03:41:23.600 align:start position:0%
carried over and wasn't properly removed
 
03:41:25.349 --> 03:41:25.359 align:start position:0%
so that's that's what happens we'll be
 
03:41:26.950 --> 03:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
correcting the fiscal note to reflect
 
03:41:29.910 --> 03:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
that okay so mr ripple just to touch
 
03:41:31.349 --> 03:41:31.359 align:start position:0%
base with you
 
03:41:33.990 --> 03:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
what i hear is that the fiscal note will
 
03:41:36.710 --> 03:41:36.720 align:start position:0%
be rather simple and just say there is
 
03:41:38.950 --> 03:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
no fiscal impact is is is that your
 
03:41:41.510 --> 03:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
understanding or am i i'm confused
 
03:41:43.349 --> 03:41:43.359 align:start position:0%
that's what it sounds like
 
03:41:44.790 --> 03:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:41:44.800 --> 03:41:45.750 align:start position:0%
all right
okay

03:41:45.750 --> 03:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:41:49.189 --> 03:41:49.199 align:start position:0%
outstanding thank you so much
 
03:41:49.199 --> 03:41:50.389 align:start position:0%
outstanding thank you so much
um

03:41:50.389 --> 03:41:50.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:50.399 --> 03:41:51.990 align:start position:0%
um
so

03:41:51.990 --> 03:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:41:54.229 --> 03:41:54.239 align:start position:0%
as we've discussed before if there's no
 
03:41:56.150 --> 03:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact it's outside of our
 
03:41:59.269 --> 03:41:59.279 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction and one way or the other
 
03:42:01.189 --> 03:42:01.199 align:start position:0%
were to
 
03:42:01.199 --> 03:42:02.870 align:start position:0%
were to
basically

03:42:02.870 --> 03:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
basically
 
03:42:05.349 --> 03:42:05.359 align:start position:0%
send it back and let the policy vote
 
03:42:05.359 --> 03:42:06.469 align:start position:0%
send it back and let the policy vote
stand

03:42:06.469 --> 03:42:06.479 align:start position:0%
stand
 
03:42:09.510 --> 03:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
now i i had a sidebar with
 
03:42:12.710 --> 03:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
representative walner we each spoke with
 
03:42:14.790 --> 03:42:14.800 align:start position:0%
the clerk today
 
03:42:18.229 --> 03:42:18.239 align:start position:0%
what the clerk said to me
 
03:42:20.070 --> 03:42:20.080 align:start position:0%
is consistent with what he said to
 
03:42:21.830 --> 03:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
representative wallner
 
03:42:24.070 --> 03:42:24.080 align:start position:0%
but representative walner is better at
 
03:42:26.150 --> 03:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
asking the follow-up question than i am
 
03:42:27.189 --> 03:42:27.199 align:start position:0%
i think
 
03:42:29.030 --> 03:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh i i
 
03:42:30.870 --> 03:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
was informed that
 
03:42:32.710 --> 03:42:32.720 align:start position:0%
if there is no fiscal impact in the
 
03:42:34.790 --> 03:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
fiscal note after an amendment
 
03:42:37.510 --> 03:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
that we should basically let the clerk
 
03:42:40.070 --> 03:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
know and he could read a statement on
 
03:42:41.590 --> 03:42:41.600 align:start position:0%
the house floor
 
03:42:43.990 --> 03:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
that would uh obviate the need for
 
03:42:45.429 --> 03:42:45.439 align:start position:0%
another vote
 
03:42:47.830 --> 03:42:47.840 align:start position:0%
what representative wallner heard that
 
03:42:51.429 --> 03:42:51.439 align:start position:0%
was supplemental to what i had been told
 
03:42:53.670 --> 03:42:53.680 align:start position:0%
is that
 
03:42:53.680 --> 03:42:54.469 align:start position:0%
is that
if

03:42:54.469 --> 03:42:54.479 align:start position:0%
if
 
03:42:57.189 --> 03:42:57.199 align:start position:0%
the item has been scheduled
 
03:42:59.269 --> 03:42:59.279 align:start position:0%
we are obligated to come up with some
 
03:43:01.269 --> 03:43:01.279 align:start position:0%
kind of recommendation
 
03:43:04.309 --> 03:43:04.319 align:start position:0%
and i have a fear that because we
 
03:43:06.710 --> 03:43:06.720 align:start position:0%
put the actual bill numbers on on the
 
03:43:08.630 --> 03:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
calendar that means we're going to have
 
03:43:10.630 --> 03:43:10.640 align:start position:0%
to have a floor vote
 
03:43:12.309 --> 03:43:12.319 align:start position:0%
eventually so is that your
 
03:43:15.910 --> 03:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
interpretation representative walner
 
03:43:19.750 --> 03:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
yes i think that's correct
 
03:43:21.750 --> 03:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:43:24.150 --> 03:43:24.160 align:start position:0%
so for these if
 
03:43:27.030 --> 03:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna verify what you verified but
 
03:43:28.790 --> 03:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
assuming you're right
 
03:43:28.800 --> 03:43:29.830 align:start position:0%
assuming you're right
um

03:43:29.830 --> 03:43:29.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:43:32.150 --> 03:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
then in that scenario what i see us
 
03:43:33.830 --> 03:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
doing is
 
03:43:36.150 --> 03:43:36.160 align:start position:0%
otp'ing these
 
03:43:38.229 --> 03:43:38.239 align:start position:0%
and explaining that there's no longer a
 
03:43:39.990 --> 03:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact
 
03:43:42.229 --> 03:43:42.239 align:start position:0%
is did anyone on the committee have a
 
03:43:43.910 --> 03:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
problem with that want to see it
 
03:43:43.920 --> 03:43:45.429 align:start position:0%
problem with that want to see it
different

03:43:45.429 --> 03:43:45.439 align:start position:0%
different
 
03:43:45.439 --> 03:43:47.830 align:start position:0%
different
representative

03:43:47.830 --> 03:43:47.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:43:47.840 --> 03:43:48.950 align:start position:0%
representative
okay

03:43:48.950 --> 03:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:43:50.229 --> 03:43:50.239 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:43:50.239 --> 03:43:51.510 align:start position:0%
all right
so

03:43:51.510 --> 03:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:43:56.229 --> 03:43:56.239 align:start position:0%
i think we can wrap up hb 1622
 
03:43:58.870 --> 03:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
um unless anyone in the audience want to
 
03:44:01.750 --> 03:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
speak to this because i think
 
03:44:03.349 --> 03:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
we're going to pass it
 
03:44:07.990 --> 03:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
all right thank you 1622 uh is closed
 
03:44:09.990 --> 03:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
point of voter then sir do we take a
 
03:44:11.910 --> 03:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
vote on these ones that we
 
03:44:13.349 --> 03:44:13.359 align:start position:0%
need to do the otp or is that just
 
03:44:15.429 --> 03:44:15.439 align:start position:0%
happen over in the overall finance
 
03:44:17.349 --> 03:44:17.359 align:start position:0%
that that's an excellent question i
 
03:44:18.229 --> 03:44:18.239 align:start position:0%
should have
 
03:44:20.309 --> 03:44:20.319 align:start position:0%
addressed that in advance but what i
 
03:44:23.269 --> 03:44:23.279 align:start position:0%
want to do is i want to re-verify what
 
03:44:25.349 --> 03:44:25.359 align:start position:0%
representative wallner is verified so
 
03:44:28.070 --> 03:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
that monday we do the right thing so
 
03:44:29.910 --> 03:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
it should be a short and sweet thing on
 
03:44:32.229 --> 03:44:32.239 align:start position:0%
monday to to just wrap it up and know
 
03:44:36.630 --> 03:44:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:36.640 --> 03:44:37.670 align:start position:0%
 
sure

03:44:37.670 --> 03:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
sure
 
03:44:39.030 --> 03:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
but we're going to have to do it monday
 
03:44:40.710 --> 03:44:40.720 align:start position:0%
anyways because i want to know that
 
03:44:41.990 --> 03:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
we're doing the right thing whether
 
03:44:43.910 --> 03:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
we're just passing it back to the
 
03:44:45.830 --> 03:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
committee with no recommendation because
 
03:44:47.910 --> 03:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
it has no fiscal note or we're going to
 
03:44:49.910 --> 03:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
do an otp so i'm
 
03:44:51.110 --> 03:44:51.120 align:start position:0%
i i
 
03:44:51.120 --> 03:44:52.229 align:start position:0%
i i
i

03:44:52.229 --> 03:44:52.239 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:44:55.910 --> 03:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not ready to do a show answer
 
03:44:55.920 --> 03:44:57.510 align:start position:0%
i'm not ready to do a show answer
okay

03:44:57.510 --> 03:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:44:57.520 --> 03:44:58.630 align:start position:0%
okay
so

03:44:58.630 --> 03:44:58.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:45:00.790 --> 03:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
that leaves us with three more bills to
 
03:45:03.990 --> 03:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
go today hb 16 42
 
03:45:07.269 --> 03:45:07.279 align:start position:0%
15 26 15 31.
 
03:45:10.389 --> 03:45:10.399 align:start position:0%
um i i scheduled them at three
 
03:45:13.910 --> 03:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
because i expected hb 1609 to
 
03:45:16.389 --> 03:45:16.399 align:start position:0%
to run much longer than it did
 
03:45:18.550 --> 03:45:18.560 align:start position:0%
so unfortunately we can't start those
 
03:45:20.870 --> 03:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
three bills until 3 p.m
 
03:45:23.670 --> 03:45:23.680 align:start position:0%
uh so i have to put us into recess until
 
03:45:25.349 --> 03:45:25.359 align:start position:0%
then um
 
03:45:27.429 --> 03:45:27.439 align:start position:0%
so we are in
 
04:52:51.830 --> 04:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:51.840 --> 04:57:04.230 align:start position:0%
 
you

04:57:04.230 --> 04:57:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:06.948 --> 04:57:06.958 align:start position:0%
uh representative kenner can we take our
 
04:57:17.350 --> 04:57:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:21.430 --> 04:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
uh okay so it being uh 302 uh i'm going
 
04:57:23.590 --> 04:57:23.600 align:start position:0%
to call the um
 
04:57:26.948 --> 04:57:26.958 align:start position:0%
today's hearing uh back out of recess
 
04:57:29.510 --> 04:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh representative rogers has had to
 
04:57:33.110 --> 04:57:33.120 align:start position:0%
leave uh leave us today so
 
04:57:35.910 --> 04:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
i i promised her that given her
 
04:57:37.830 --> 04:57:37.840 align:start position:0%
the vital need for her to leave that
 
04:57:39.750 --> 04:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
that we would not conduct any straw
 
04:57:39.760 --> 04:57:41.270 align:start position:0%
that we would not conduct any straw
votes

04:57:41.270 --> 04:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
votes
 
04:57:45.510 --> 04:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
which is a little problematic because um
 
04:57:48.390 --> 04:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
i think we're ready to to decide on
 
04:57:48.400 --> 04:57:51.430 align:start position:0%
i think we're ready to to decide on
1662.

04:57:51.430 --> 04:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:53.430 --> 04:57:53.440 align:start position:0%
uh now that representative weiler is in
 
04:57:56.070 --> 04:57:56.080 align:start position:0%
we deferred for him to get here
 
04:57:58.470 --> 04:57:58.480 align:start position:0%
so i'll look for guidance
 
04:58:01.350 --> 04:58:01.360 align:start position:0%
from you representative walner and you
 
04:58:03.030 --> 04:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
representative knurk
 
04:58:05.590 --> 04:58:05.600 align:start position:0%
or do you do you think you two
 
04:58:09.110 --> 04:58:09.120 align:start position:0%
would be in favor of 1662
 
04:58:09.120 --> 04:58:11.510 align:start position:0%
would be in favor of 1662
otp

04:58:11.510 --> 04:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
otp
 
04:58:13.590 --> 04:58:13.600 align:start position:0%
with the new fiscal note and there's an
 
04:58:15.110 --> 04:58:15.120 align:start position:0%
amendment that
 
04:58:18.150 --> 04:58:18.160 align:start position:0%
that mr ripple is going to bring to us
 
04:58:21.670 --> 04:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
that clarifies one p a per it system and
 
04:58:23.830 --> 04:58:23.840 align:start position:0%
that we're hiring a wage grade 30
 
04:58:25.990 --> 04:58:26.000 align:start position:0%
instead of 32.
 
04:58:27.910 --> 04:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note will be updated to
 
04:58:33.670 --> 04:58:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:35.030 --> 04:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't want to put you under
 
04:58:37.430 --> 04:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
pressure we can come back i but if you
 
04:58:40.708 --> 04:58:40.718 align:start position:0%
if you two are in favor of it then i
 
04:58:42.390 --> 04:58:42.400 align:start position:0%
then i'd be comfortable
 
04:58:44.470 --> 04:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
having us hold our vote without
 
04:58:48.550 --> 04:58:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:48.560 --> 04:58:49.350 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:58:49.350 --> 04:58:49.360 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:58:51.350 --> 04:58:51.360 align:start position:0%
just so the key was to say again for
 
04:58:54.070 --> 04:58:54.080 align:start position:0%
each program and to change the grade and
 
04:58:55.190 --> 04:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
that's all you're going to be changing
 
04:58:57.910 --> 04:58:57.920 align:start position:0%
so far yes sir uh it's not quite a
 
04:59:00.550 --> 04:59:00.560 align:start position:0%
program it's per itc
 
04:59:02.948 --> 04:59:02.958 align:start position:0%
you would call it a project the program
 
04:59:04.868 --> 04:59:04.878 align:start position:0%
would be the amalgamation of all the
 
04:59:06.868 --> 04:59:06.878 align:start position:0%
projects got it sorry i i don't know
 
04:59:08.788 --> 04:59:08.798 align:start position:0%
that terminology as well thank you
 
04:59:10.708 --> 04:59:10.718 align:start position:0%
i think it makes sense i i because you
 
04:59:12.708 --> 04:59:12.718 align:start position:0%
know we passed it out 18 to 3 in
 
04:59:14.310 --> 04:59:14.320 align:start position:0%
committee and those changes you're
 
04:59:16.070 --> 04:59:16.080 align:start position:0%
making are very minor the pay grade is
 
04:59:17.910 --> 04:59:17.920 align:start position:0%
just a reality that's not something we
 
04:59:19.590 --> 04:59:19.600 align:start position:0%
worried about and uh
 
04:59:21.510 --> 04:59:21.520 align:start position:0%
the other part is just a clarification
 
04:59:22.628 --> 04:59:22.638 align:start position:0%
as you point out i think it makes
 
04:59:24.470 --> 04:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
perfect sense so i would certainly be
 
04:59:26.470 --> 04:59:26.480 align:start position:0%
comfortable with moving ahead with that
 
04:59:29.510 --> 04:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh amendment and uh moving on
 
04:59:32.070 --> 04:59:32.080 align:start position:0%
all right um mr clerk i need some advice
 
04:59:34.070 --> 04:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
i just uh stuck my head in and watched
 
04:59:36.948 --> 04:59:36.958 align:start position:0%
division two and they took a a roll call
 
04:59:38.948 --> 04:59:38.958 align:start position:0%
vote in their working group
 
04:59:41.590 --> 04:59:41.600 align:start position:0%
and recorded roll call
 
04:59:44.550 --> 04:59:44.560 align:start position:0%
and i i was under the impression that we
 
04:59:46.150 --> 04:59:46.160 align:start position:0%
only needed to do
 
04:59:48.390 --> 04:59:48.400 align:start position:0%
a raising of hands in order to record a
 
04:59:50.390 --> 04:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
vote in a working group
 
04:59:53.190 --> 04:59:53.200 align:start position:0%
so um i i could use some advice if we're
 
04:59:55.670 --> 04:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
gonna vote on 1662 should we do a roll
 
04:59:57.750 --> 04:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
call or a raising of hands
 
04:59:59.110 --> 04:59:59.120 align:start position:0%
we should probably
 
05:00:00.708 --> 05:00:00.718 align:start position:0%
we should probably do a roll call vote
 
05:00:02.628 --> 05:00:02.638 align:start position:0%
on every one of these that we want to
 
05:00:04.310 --> 05:00:04.320 align:start position:0%
send forward to the full committee
 
05:00:06.628 --> 05:00:06.638 align:start position:0%
that's the purpose of having the the uh
 
05:00:09.190 --> 05:00:09.200 align:start position:0%
division is so we come and as you note
 
05:00:11.350 --> 05:00:11.360 align:start position:0%
when we sit down and have a
 
05:00:13.590 --> 05:00:13.600 align:start position:0%
piece of paper before us telling how the
 
05:00:15.910 --> 05:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
the different divisions always has a
 
05:00:15.920 --> 05:00:16.868 align:start position:0%
the different divisions always has a
vote

05:00:16.868 --> 05:00:16.878 align:start position:0%
vote
 
05:00:18.948 --> 05:00:18.958 align:start position:0%
three to two or whatever
 
05:00:21.910 --> 05:00:21.920 align:start position:0%
okay so i will do a roll call i will
 
05:00:24.390 --> 05:00:24.400 align:start position:0%
entertain a motion
 
05:00:25.910 --> 05:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
to accept
 
05:00:29.030 --> 05:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
hb 1662 with the coming
 
05:00:31.910 --> 05:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
amendment that mr ripple is preparing
 
05:00:33.590 --> 05:00:33.600 align:start position:0%
the amendment will be limited to
 
05:00:35.670 --> 05:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
changing the labor grade
 
05:00:38.868 --> 05:00:38.878 align:start position:0%
and and the financial analysis from a
 
05:00:42.788 --> 05:00:42.798 align:start position:0%
wage grade 32 to 30. but another note we
 
05:00:44.310 --> 05:00:44.320 align:start position:0%
usually don't vote without the amendment
 
05:00:45.430 --> 05:00:45.440 align:start position:0%
before us
 
05:00:47.110 --> 05:00:47.120 align:start position:0%
okay so should we wait till monday
 
05:00:49.110 --> 05:00:49.120 align:start position:0%
anyways yeah yeah
 
05:00:51.110 --> 05:00:51.120 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
05:00:54.708 --> 05:00:54.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:54.718 --> 05:00:56.628 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:00:56.628 --> 05:00:56.638 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:00:59.830 --> 05:00:59.840 align:start position:0%
so earlier we voted on 1609 with the
 
05:01:03.590 --> 05:01:03.600 align:start position:0%
show of hands and it was a 4-3
 
05:01:05.190 --> 05:01:05.200 align:start position:0%
let me do that one
 
05:01:05.200 --> 05:01:06.868 align:start position:0%
let me do that one
well

05:01:06.868 --> 05:01:06.878 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:01:08.948 --> 05:01:08.958 align:start position:0%
representative rogers isn't here so we
 
05:01:10.868 --> 05:01:10.878 align:start position:0%
wouldn't record or vote if we did it on
 
05:01:12.230 --> 05:01:12.240 align:start position:0%
a roll call
 
05:01:14.868 --> 05:01:14.878 align:start position:0%
so i i think we're going to have to um
 
05:01:17.110 --> 05:01:17.120 align:start position:0%
wait remember how everybody voted
 
05:01:19.510 --> 05:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
well i i do too i i
 
05:01:21.830 --> 05:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
let me ask representative walner
 
05:01:24.868 --> 05:01:24.878 align:start position:0%
representative uh kanerk if you have an
 
05:01:28.550 --> 05:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
objection to us recording
 
05:01:32.310 --> 05:01:32.320 align:start position:0%
a 4-3 vote on 1609 based on our how we
 
05:01:34.070 --> 05:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
know everyone voted
 
05:01:35.990 --> 05:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
i i would really let's just wait until
 
05:01:38.230 --> 05:01:38.240 align:start position:0%
representative rogers is here on monday
 
05:01:39.910 --> 05:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
we can go through these pretty fast on
 
05:01:42.390 --> 05:01:42.400 align:start position:0%
monday don't you think i i agree i'm
 
05:01:45.350 --> 05:01:45.360 align:start position:0%
fine with that so i just know she'd
 
05:01:45.360 --> 05:01:47.430 align:start position:0%
fine with that so i just know she'd
okay

05:01:47.430 --> 05:01:47.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:01:50.070 --> 05:01:50.080 align:start position:0%
all right so with that i
 
05:01:53.910 --> 05:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
oh and over our recess i validated that
 
05:01:56.390 --> 05:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
representative walner is asks better
 
05:01:58.948 --> 05:01:58.958 align:start position:0%
questions than i do because she got the
 
05:02:01.990 --> 05:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
she got the proper response uh we if
 
05:02:04.230 --> 05:02:04.240 align:start position:0%
once it gets calendared we have to vote
 
05:02:06.070 --> 05:02:06.080 align:start position:0%
on it so um
 
05:02:08.310 --> 05:02:08.320 align:start position:0%
so we will have to vote on all of those
 
05:02:11.030 --> 05:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
on monday instead of just passing it
 
05:02:14.310 --> 05:02:14.320 align:start position:0%
asking for them to waive votes
 
05:02:17.550 --> 05:02:17.560 align:start position:0%
now i think i'm ready for to open
 
05:02:21.270 --> 05:02:21.280 align:start position:0%
1642 relative to lead testing and
 
05:02:21.280 --> 05:02:23.030 align:start position:0%
1642 relative to lead testing and
children

05:02:23.030 --> 05:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
children
 
05:02:24.788 --> 05:02:24.798 align:start position:0%
is there anyone from the department that
 
05:02:30.150 --> 05:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:31.430 --> 05:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
and then just
 
05:02:33.110 --> 05:02:33.120 align:start position:0%
give us your name and your
 
05:02:42.310 --> 05:02:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:43.510 --> 05:02:43.520 align:start position:0%

exactly

05:02:53.510 --> 05:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
05:02:56.150 --> 05:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
i think i've seen it before
 
05:02:57.990 --> 05:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
good afternoon michelle roberge i'm the
 
05:03:00.150 --> 05:03:00.160 align:start position:0%
bureau chief for public health
 
05:03:01.830 --> 05:03:01.840 align:start position:0%

05:03:03.190 --> 05:03:03.200 align:start position:0%

05:03:06.550 --> 05:03:06.560 align:start position:0%
michelle drewer michelle robersch r-o-b
 
05:03:12.230 --> 05:03:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:13.750 --> 05:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
all right what would you like us to know
 
05:03:19.830 --> 05:03:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:21.030 --> 05:03:21.040 align:start position:0%
at this point i think we want you to
 
05:03:23.590 --> 05:03:23.600 align:start position:0%
know that the fiscal impact is negative
 
05:03:24.788 --> 05:03:24.798 align:start position:0%
for the department of health and human
 
05:03:24.798 --> 05:03:26.628 align:start position:0%
for the department of health and human
services

05:03:26.628 --> 05:03:26.638 align:start position:0%
services
 
05:03:26.638 --> 05:03:27.750 align:start position:0%
services
um

05:03:27.750 --> 05:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:03:29.910 --> 05:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
you don't literally mean negative i
 
05:03:33.110 --> 05:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
think you technically you mean neutral
 
05:03:35.030 --> 05:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
you are correct i do not mean negative
 
05:03:36.470 --> 05:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:03:38.948 --> 05:03:38.958 align:start position:0%
yeah the amendment um
 
05:03:41.430 --> 05:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
takes away any of the physical impact uh
 
05:03:43.990 --> 05:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
that that we originally filed with the
 
05:03:44.000 --> 05:03:44.948 align:start position:0%
that that we originally filed with the
fiscal

05:03:44.948 --> 05:03:44.958 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
05:03:47.270 --> 05:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
note worksheet so the new
 
05:03:50.470 --> 05:03:50.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact is is neutral yes
 
05:03:53.350 --> 05:03:53.360 align:start position:0%
i i want you to bring forward negative
 
05:03:56.390 --> 05:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal impacts in the future please uh
 
05:03:59.350 --> 05:03:59.360 align:start position:0%
but uh all right so um
 
05:04:01.350 --> 05:04:01.360 align:start position:0%
there's probably no one here
 
05:04:03.590 --> 05:04:03.600 align:start position:0%
representing the local school districts
 
05:04:06.230 --> 05:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
so if that's the case is there anyone
 
05:04:07.910 --> 05:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
here representing the local school
 
05:04:07.920 --> 05:04:09.270 align:start position:0%
here representing the local school
districts

05:04:09.270 --> 05:04:09.280 align:start position:0%
districts
 
05:04:10.788 --> 05:04:10.798 align:start position:0%
not seeing any
 
05:04:13.110 --> 05:04:13.120 align:start position:0%
would you speak to the other part of the
 
05:04:15.030 --> 05:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
note that sounds like there's an
 
05:04:17.110 --> 05:04:17.120 align:start position:0%
indeterminable cost
 
05:04:18.390 --> 05:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
05:04:24.390 --> 05:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:26.788 --> 05:04:26.798 align:start position:0%
from our understanding is that the
 
05:04:30.070 --> 05:04:30.080 align:start position:0%
concern was expressed
 
05:04:30.080 --> 05:04:32.628 align:start position:0%
concern was expressed
regarding

05:04:32.628 --> 05:04:32.638 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
05:04:35.110 --> 05:04:35.120 align:start position:0%
the need for schools and child care
 
05:04:36.788 --> 05:04:36.798 align:start position:0%
facilities to
 
05:04:38.948 --> 05:04:38.958 align:start position:0%
make sure that the lead testing was
 
05:04:41.190 --> 05:04:41.200 align:start position:0%
completed so that they would and they're
 
05:04:43.510 --> 05:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
currently already doing it for
 
05:04:46.070 --> 05:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
other reasons so it's just an additional
 
05:04:48.470 --> 05:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
check if you will for when the child
 
05:04:50.230 --> 05:04:50.240 align:start position:0%
either enters the school system or a
 
05:04:52.550 --> 05:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
child care facility and that's our
 
05:04:53.910 --> 05:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
understanding of
 
05:04:57.270 --> 05:04:57.280 align:start position:0%
the concerns that were expressed from
 
05:04:59.830 --> 05:04:59.840 align:start position:0%
either child care facilities or schools
 
05:05:01.830 --> 05:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
so i've recently had a lot of
 
05:05:03.910 --> 05:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
conversations with the principal at the
 
05:05:05.750 --> 05:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
auburn village school
 
05:05:07.510 --> 05:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
and i i just want to make sure i
 
05:05:09.270 --> 05:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
understand the situation because she's
 
05:05:10.708 --> 05:05:10.718 align:start position:0%
going to ask me
 
05:05:10.718 --> 05:05:11.830 align:start position:0%
going to ask me
okay

05:05:11.830 --> 05:05:11.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:05:14.390 --> 05:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
there's an indeterminable cost but we
 
05:05:16.070 --> 05:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
know that there's a cost and it's
 
05:05:18.310 --> 05:05:18.320 align:start position:0%
non-zero it's there's there's actually
 
05:05:20.550 --> 05:05:20.560 align:start position:0%
some cost that the school systems are
 
05:05:21.990 --> 05:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
going to have to pay
 
05:05:24.390 --> 05:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
in order to support this change in
 
05:05:26.550 --> 05:05:26.560 align:start position:0%
funding is that true or false and then
 
05:05:31.510 --> 05:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:31.520 --> 05:05:39.830 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:05:39.830 --> 05:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:42.390 --> 05:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
do you want me to ask mr ripple or or if
 
05:05:43.910 --> 05:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
you're not i sense you're not
 
05:05:45.670 --> 05:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
comfortable answering it yeah i'm i'm
 
05:05:47.190 --> 05:05:47.200 align:start position:0%
not comfortable answering that because
 
05:05:49.190 --> 05:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
i'm you know i'm not sure what the cost
 
05:05:51.670 --> 05:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
would be for the school systems
 
05:05:53.270 --> 05:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
okay you're in a safe zone you don't
 
05:05:56.070 --> 05:05:56.080 align:start position:0%
have to answer so representative kenner
 
05:05:57.750 --> 05:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh yes the this
 
05:05:59.830 --> 05:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
the uh this is a bill i kind of adopted
 
05:06:01.030 --> 05:06:01.040 align:start position:0%
in our committee and i this is the
 
05:06:03.030 --> 05:06:03.040 align:start position:0%
amendment for it was mine to get rid of
 
05:06:05.190 --> 05:06:05.200 align:start position:0%
all the fiscal impact it's important to
 
05:06:07.830 --> 05:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
realize there already is a form
 
05:06:09.030 --> 05:06:09.040 align:start position:0%
that exists it's called the new
 
05:06:10.628 --> 05:06:10.638 align:start position:0%
hampshire early childhood health
 
05:06:12.150 --> 05:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
assessment record
 
05:06:14.470 --> 05:06:14.480 align:start position:0%
it is for use from birth through grade
 
05:06:14.480 --> 05:06:15.590 align:start position:0%
it is for use from birth through grade
three

05:06:15.590 --> 05:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
three
 
05:06:18.230 --> 05:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
it is the form that is already used when
 
05:06:20.628 --> 05:06:20.638 align:start position:0%
kids come into child care for
 
05:06:22.708 --> 05:06:22.718 align:start position:0%
child care systems for example and it is
 
05:06:24.390 --> 05:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
where one documents all the various
 
05:06:26.708 --> 05:06:26.718 align:start position:0%
immunizations and there already exists
 
05:06:29.670 --> 05:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
the slot for the provider to check
 
05:06:31.510 --> 05:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
uh for the lead levels
 
05:06:32.868 --> 05:06:32.878 align:start position:0%
so it's already there for them to fill
 
05:06:35.270 --> 05:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
out um on the form
 
05:06:37.270 --> 05:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
so there really is no need for a new
 
05:06:37.280 --> 05:06:39.030 align:start position:0%
so there really is no need for a new
form

05:06:39.030 --> 05:06:39.040 align:start position:0%
form
 
05:06:40.550 --> 05:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
all it is is a matter that they will
 
05:06:41.910 --> 05:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
look and see that somebody entered a
 
05:06:43.110 --> 05:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
lead test
 
05:06:44.390 --> 05:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
when the time that they're checking the
 
05:06:44.400 --> 05:06:45.510 align:start position:0%
when the time that they're checking the
form

05:06:45.510 --> 05:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
form
 
05:06:48.310 --> 05:06:48.320 align:start position:0%
um so i don't i do not expect that there
 
05:06:50.230 --> 05:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
ought to be any kind of a big new cost
 
05:06:51.670 --> 05:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
because this form already exists and
 
05:06:53.270 --> 05:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
it's when the kids first enter which is
 
05:06:55.270 --> 05:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
generally going to be kindergarten
 
05:06:58.628 --> 05:06:58.638 align:start position:0%
so may i ask you a follow-up yes sir um
 
05:06:58.638 --> 05:06:59.990 align:start position:0%
so may i ask you a follow-up yes sir um
so

05:06:59.990 --> 05:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:07:02.230 --> 05:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
so the the form is already done and
 
05:07:04.868 --> 05:07:04.878 align:start position:0%
complete and available to the schools if
 
05:07:06.868 --> 05:07:06.878 align:start position:0%
i'm hearing you right and this is just
 
05:07:07.910 --> 05:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
an issue
 
05:07:09.990 --> 05:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
of them validating that they complete
 
05:07:12.150 --> 05:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
the form properly it's best to
 
05:07:13.510 --> 05:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
understand first of all it's important
 
05:07:14.868 --> 05:07:14.878 align:start position:0%
to understand this was sent to me by the
 
05:07:16.628 --> 05:07:16.638 align:start position:0%
people who do child care licensing that
 
05:07:17.830 --> 05:07:17.840 align:start position:0%
this is the form that they're already
 
05:07:19.990 --> 05:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
using but since it is labeled for use
 
05:07:22.230 --> 05:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
from birth through grade three i do not
 
05:07:24.390 --> 05:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
know for sure if all the schools do the
 
05:07:25.990 --> 05:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
same thing but it's important to
 
05:07:27.510 --> 05:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
understand that they already have the
 
05:07:28.868 --> 05:07:28.878 align:start position:0%
health forms that are going to be filled
 
05:07:32.628 --> 05:07:32.638 align:start position:0%
out by the providers anyway and it's i i
 
05:07:35.110 --> 05:07:35.120 align:start position:0%
i you know it's it's since the providers
 
05:07:35.990 --> 05:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
are used to it because it's a
 
05:07:38.470 --> 05:07:38.480 align:start position:0%
requirement just to clarify the
 
05:07:40.390 --> 05:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
requirement for this test we came to
 
05:07:44.550 --> 05:07:44.560 align:start position:0%
sb247 in 2018 and it's a requirement by
 
05:07:46.470 --> 05:07:46.480 align:start position:0%
age one and again by age two to have a
 
05:07:48.788 --> 05:07:48.798 align:start position:0%
lead test parents can opt out if they
 
05:07:51.110 --> 05:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
wish not to have their child tested and
 
05:07:53.590 --> 05:07:53.600 align:start position:0%
that is not changed by this bill
 
05:07:55.190 --> 05:07:55.200 align:start position:0%
the the point of this bill was simply
 
05:07:57.030 --> 05:07:57.040 align:start position:0%
another point of contact to remind
 
05:07:59.190 --> 05:07:59.200 align:start position:0%
parents of the importance of having
 
05:08:01.190 --> 05:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
their child lead tested because if we
 
05:08:02.788 --> 05:08:02.798 align:start position:0%
identify them early we can treat them
 
05:08:04.390 --> 05:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
before you end up with lifelong learning
 
05:08:06.390 --> 05:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
disabilities and other problems
 
05:08:08.470 --> 05:08:08.480 align:start position:0%
so that's the whole point of this and so
 
05:08:10.310 --> 05:08:10.320 align:start position:0%
the providers already are doing it it's
 
05:08:12.470 --> 05:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
already in all of their ehrs which are
 
05:08:14.390 --> 05:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
electric electronic health records which
 
05:08:16.310 --> 05:08:16.320 align:start position:0%
is how most the provider the provider
 
05:08:18.470 --> 05:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
records are actually kept and so there
 
05:08:20.150 --> 05:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
really isn't a big large reporting
 
05:08:21.510 --> 05:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
burden because they already have to
 
05:08:23.350 --> 05:08:23.360 align:start position:0%
report things like the immunizations and
 
05:08:25.270 --> 05:08:25.280 align:start position:0%
other factors when the kids enter
 
05:08:28.390 --> 05:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:29.990 --> 05:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
so is there a retro
 
05:08:33.430 --> 05:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
retro active component to this or
 
05:08:35.110 --> 05:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
are they sort of grandfathered in the
 
05:08:36.788 --> 05:08:36.798 align:start position:0%
reporting that they've done or are they
 
05:08:39.030 --> 05:08:39.040 align:start position:0%
going to be subject to going back and
 
05:08:41.030 --> 05:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
correcting the records they have on hand
 
05:08:43.430 --> 05:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
i do not it see it certainly was not
 
05:08:46.948 --> 05:08:46.958 align:start position:0%
designed to be retroactive at all it was
 
05:08:49.750 --> 05:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
a requirement for entry
 
05:08:51.430 --> 05:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
um and so
 
05:08:51.440 --> 05:08:53.590 align:start position:0%
um and so
uh

05:08:53.590 --> 05:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:08:55.590 --> 05:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
i i don't anticipate that there's any
 
05:08:57.830 --> 05:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
retroactive work to be done first of all
 
05:08:59.830 --> 05:08:59.840 align:start position:0%
once it kids it gets too old it's
 
05:09:01.430 --> 05:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
not as much of an issue they're trying
 
05:09:02.628 --> 05:09:02.638 align:start position:0%
to catch them when they're very young
 
05:09:03.910 --> 05:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
because that's when you can make a big
 
05:09:05.430 --> 05:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
difference in their life right i
 
05:09:07.030 --> 05:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
remember that testimony yes i remember
 
05:09:08.708 --> 05:09:08.718 align:start position:0%
we were together on that committee uh
 
05:09:11.030 --> 05:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
representative walner did you have an
 
05:09:14.070 --> 05:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
issue i just want could i ask a question
 
05:09:15.510 --> 05:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
of the okay
 
05:09:16.628 --> 05:09:16.638 align:start position:0%
so i
 
05:09:18.708 --> 05:09:18.718 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to know
 
05:09:22.948 --> 05:09:22.958 align:start position:0%
sort of what do you see as the
 
05:09:24.948 --> 05:09:24.958 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the child care
 
05:09:27.990 --> 05:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
provider if a family does not have this
 
05:09:28.000 --> 05:09:30.708 align:start position:0%
provider if a family does not have this
done

05:09:30.708 --> 05:09:30.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:32.868 --> 05:09:32.878 align:start position:0%
after the six months
 
05:09:34.868 --> 05:09:34.878 align:start position:0%
do you see child care providers having
 
05:09:37.590 --> 05:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
to ask families to leave their facility
 
05:09:40.390 --> 05:09:40.400 align:start position:0%
their programs
 
05:09:41.910 --> 05:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
no that's not our understanding
 
05:09:44.470 --> 05:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
generally they work with their
 
05:09:47.670 --> 05:09:47.680 align:start position:0%
child care agencies to correct any
 
05:09:49.590 --> 05:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
any issues that
 
05:09:52.310 --> 05:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
that may arise so they
 
05:09:54.390 --> 05:09:54.400 align:start position:0%
we're not from the child care licensing
 
05:09:56.788 --> 05:09:56.798 align:start position:0%
group so
 
05:09:59.510 --> 05:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
representative conner oh i'm sorry
 
05:10:01.430 --> 05:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
i think kanark is going to respond to
 
05:10:03.430 --> 05:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
your issue okay yes basically i i
 
05:10:05.190 --> 05:10:05.200 align:start position:0%
followed i i did the follow up on that
 
05:10:06.470 --> 05:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
because that question had been raised
 
05:10:08.070 --> 05:10:08.080 align:start position:0%
and i spoke to the child care licensing
 
05:10:09.670 --> 05:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
people melissa clements
 
05:10:11.510 --> 05:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:10:13.510 --> 05:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
because the point of this is not to be
 
05:10:13.520 --> 05:10:14.628 align:start position:0%
because the point of this is not to be
punitive

05:10:14.628 --> 05:10:14.638 align:start position:0%
punitive
 
05:10:16.788 --> 05:10:16.798 align:start position:0%
again the point is to be a reminder hey
 
05:10:18.550 --> 05:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
your kid needs to be lead tested and
 
05:10:21.830 --> 05:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
that is why there is also in here that
 
05:10:23.670 --> 05:10:23.680 align:start position:0%
you know it when a parent suddenly gets
 
05:10:25.670 --> 05:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
a very valuable child care slot we
 
05:10:27.670 --> 05:10:27.680 align:start position:0%
didn't want them to lose that slot that
 
05:10:29.110 --> 05:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
allows them to get to work because they
 
05:10:30.788 --> 05:10:30.798 align:start position:0%
didn't have their kid lead tested so
 
05:10:33.030 --> 05:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
there's a grace period to remediate it
 
05:10:34.150 --> 05:10:34.160 align:start position:0%
and the question came up well what
 
05:10:36.628 --> 05:10:36.638 align:start position:0%
happens if they don't and the answer is
 
05:10:38.708 --> 05:10:38.718 align:start position:0%
nobody's going to throw the kid out the
 
05:10:40.390 --> 05:10:40.400 align:start position:0%
way that they do this it's the same as
 
05:10:42.070 --> 05:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
if a kid has not gotten their
 
05:10:43.990 --> 05:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
immunizations documented
 
05:10:46.390 --> 05:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
it comes up at licensing because this is
 
05:10:47.830 --> 05:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
actually in the
 
05:10:50.788 --> 05:10:50.798 align:start position:0%
licensing issues so at license review if
 
05:10:53.910 --> 05:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
the agency determines that they have you
 
05:10:53.920 --> 05:10:54.708 align:start position:0%
the agency determines that they have you
know

05:10:54.708 --> 05:10:54.718 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:10:56.150 --> 05:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
they're never checking it they'll say
 
05:10:57.910 --> 05:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
you need to be checking this
 
05:10:59.430 --> 05:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
if they find that there's one or two
 
05:11:01.590 --> 05:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
kids they'll say there's a problem these
 
05:11:03.510 --> 05:11:03.520 align:start position:0%
couple of kids have not gotten it and
 
05:11:05.030 --> 05:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
their response will be the same as it is
 
05:11:06.230 --> 05:11:06.240 align:start position:0%
with immunization they're going to try
 
05:11:07.510 --> 05:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
to work with that kid they're going to
 
05:11:09.430 --> 05:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
ask the child care agency to try to
 
05:11:11.110 --> 05:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
remediate it but they're not going to
 
05:11:12.150 --> 05:11:12.160 align:start position:0%
yank their license so they're not going
 
05:11:14.948 --> 05:11:14.958 align:start position:0%
to throw kids out and that that was the
 
05:11:16.550 --> 05:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
there was a conversation i had with
 
05:11:18.070 --> 05:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
melissa clements the director of trial
 
05:11:19.510 --> 05:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
care licensing
 
05:11:21.670 --> 05:11:21.680 align:start position:0%
bureau chief i think it's called uh just
 
05:11:24.150 --> 05:11:24.160 align:start position:0%
on friday i think it was so
 
05:11:25.910 --> 05:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
we're we're okay there this is not a the
 
05:11:27.510 --> 05:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
idea is not to throw people out the idea
 
05:11:29.430 --> 05:11:29.440 align:start position:0%
is to remind her
 
05:11:31.430 --> 05:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
representative waller you had another
 
05:11:31.440 --> 05:11:32.948 align:start position:0%
representative waller you had another
point

05:11:32.948 --> 05:11:32.958 align:start position:0%
point
 
05:11:35.670 --> 05:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
no i just know that i've spent 50 years
 
05:11:37.990 --> 05:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
in child care so i've been through this
 
05:11:41.510 --> 05:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:44.070 --> 05:11:44.080 align:start position:0%
you know i just want to be sure that
 
05:11:47.590 --> 05:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
families are safeguarded from
 
05:11:47.600 --> 05:11:48.628 align:start position:0%
families are safeguarded from
losing

05:11:48.628 --> 05:11:48.638 align:start position:0%
losing
 
05:11:51.350 --> 05:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
their place and particularly now because
 
05:11:53.430 --> 05:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
getting into child care now
 
05:11:55.750 --> 05:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
is like winning the lottery because
 
05:11:59.350 --> 05:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
there are very few places available so
 
05:12:00.788 --> 05:12:00.798 align:start position:0%
i don't want another
 
05:12:02.868 --> 05:12:02.878 align:start position:0%
another stumbling block put in front of
 
05:12:05.990 --> 05:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
families who need to to work so so
 
05:12:06.000 --> 05:12:08.550 align:start position:0%
families who need to to work so so
representative

05:12:08.550 --> 05:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:10.788 --> 05:12:10.798 align:start position:0%
you're i think you have a valid concern
 
05:12:11.750 --> 05:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
do you do you see
 
05:12:11.760 --> 05:12:13.430 align:start position:0%
do you do you see
[Music]

05:12:13.430 --> 05:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:12:15.910 --> 05:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
an advantage to making that clear in
 
05:12:19.430 --> 05:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:21.830 --> 05:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
no i would have to see what how we would
 
05:12:23.910 --> 05:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
clear how we would make that clear i
 
05:12:25.590 --> 05:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
guess i would want the department to
 
05:12:27.750 --> 05:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
comment on how it could be
 
05:12:29.670 --> 05:12:29.680 align:start position:0%
very clear
 
05:12:31.670 --> 05:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
remember this is the finance department
 
05:12:33.270 --> 05:12:33.280 align:start position:0%
the finance
 
05:12:35.750 --> 05:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
committee but i do see that this could
 
05:12:38.230 --> 05:12:38.240 align:start position:0%
have financial
 
05:12:41.110 --> 05:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
it could end up having a financial
 
05:12:42.948 --> 05:12:42.958 align:start position:0%
problem for a family
 
05:12:44.470 --> 05:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
if they lost
 
05:12:46.948 --> 05:12:46.958 align:start position:0%
their childcare position so
 
05:12:46.958 --> 05:12:49.350 align:start position:0%
their childcare position so
just

05:12:49.350 --> 05:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:51.190 --> 05:12:51.200 align:start position:0%
want to be sure that
 
05:12:53.110 --> 05:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
it's not going to cause a problem for
 
05:12:55.910 --> 05:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
families i i think addressing your issue
 
05:12:57.590 --> 05:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
if we wanted to do would be pretty
 
05:12:59.590 --> 05:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
simple it'd just be one more sentence
 
05:13:02.070 --> 05:13:02.080 align:start position:0%
after the two bold areas
 
05:13:03.990 --> 05:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
you know that says something the effect
 
05:13:05.830 --> 05:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
05:13:08.070 --> 05:13:08.080 align:start position:0%
no parent or child
 
05:13:09.590 --> 05:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
would be held to
 
05:13:09.600 --> 05:13:12.150 align:start position:0%
would be held to
punitive

05:13:12.150 --> 05:13:12.160 align:start position:0%
punitive
 
05:13:12.160 --> 05:13:13.110 align:start position:0%
punitive
um

05:13:13.110 --> 05:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:13:13.120 --> 05:13:14.470 align:start position:0%
um
action

05:13:14.470 --> 05:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
action
 
05:13:16.070 --> 05:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
based on
 
05:13:17.750 --> 05:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
whether or not they've
 
05:13:21.270 --> 05:13:21.280 align:start position:0%
provided the test information
 
05:13:23.190 --> 05:13:23.200 align:start position:0%
something like that mr ripple writes
 
05:13:25.350 --> 05:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
better than i do i mumble and stumble
 
05:13:27.750 --> 05:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
and then he he comes up with it
 
05:13:27.760 --> 05:13:28.948 align:start position:0%
and then he he comes up with it
so

05:13:28.948 --> 05:13:28.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:13:28.958 --> 05:13:30.070 align:start position:0%
so
i

05:13:30.070 --> 05:13:30.080 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:13:37.030 --> 05:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:40.150 --> 05:13:40.160 align:start position:0%
yes i think we would be fine with that
 
05:13:42.868 --> 05:13:42.878 align:start position:0%
do you would you like to see that i i
 
05:13:45.110 --> 05:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
would like to see something that that
 
05:13:48.230 --> 05:13:48.240 align:start position:0%
clarifies that this won't be used as
 
05:13:49.910 --> 05:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
a way for children to have to leave
 
05:13:56.550 --> 05:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:58.390 --> 05:13:58.400 align:start position:0%
we would be happy to review any language
 
05:14:00.390 --> 05:14:00.400 align:start position:0%
and get back to you on any impact that
 
05:14:05.030 --> 05:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
it may have um i can speak to
 
05:14:07.190 --> 05:14:07.200 align:start position:0%
you know currently the department you
 
05:14:08.868 --> 05:14:08.878 align:start position:0%
know this would be treated no
 
05:14:10.390 --> 05:14:10.400 align:start position:0%
differently than what's currently the
 
05:14:11.910 --> 05:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
department is currently doing with child
 
05:14:15.190 --> 05:14:15.200 align:start position:0%
care licensing requirements now so any
 
05:14:17.510 --> 05:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
of the requirements that are currently
 
05:14:19.430 --> 05:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
in place um
 
05:14:21.510 --> 05:14:21.520 align:start position:0%
this would be treated no differently
 
05:14:23.510 --> 05:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
than what they're currently doing now
 
05:14:25.830 --> 05:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
for immunizations and other and other
 
05:14:29.430 --> 05:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
things so there is no intention
 
05:14:31.590 --> 05:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
from the department's perspective
 
05:14:33.750 --> 05:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
to to treat it any differently or be
 
05:14:35.030 --> 05:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
punitive if
 
05:14:37.510 --> 05:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
if it goes beyond the six months period
 
05:14:39.590 --> 05:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
or anything
 
05:14:41.670 --> 05:14:41.680 align:start position:0%
representative nerd uh yes indeed
 
05:14:43.350 --> 05:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
because it is in the licensing it's in
 
05:14:46.470 --> 05:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
170 e 19 and that is the licensing
 
05:14:47.750 --> 05:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
statute and that's precisely what
 
05:14:49.110 --> 05:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
melissa clement said that it would be
 
05:14:51.270 --> 05:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
treated precisely the same as all the
 
05:14:52.628 --> 05:14:52.638 align:start position:0%
other licensing record-keeping
 
05:14:54.628 --> 05:14:54.638 align:start position:0%
requirements it is actually just one
 
05:14:56.310 --> 05:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
part of the record keeping
 
05:14:59.510 --> 05:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
so yeah there's nothing here about
 
05:15:01.510 --> 05:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
a health issue of throwing a kid out
 
05:15:02.708 --> 05:15:02.718 align:start position:0%
because there isn't
 
05:15:04.628 --> 05:15:04.638 align:start position:0%
it's purely a matter of the licensing
 
05:15:06.150 --> 05:15:06.160 align:start position:0%
and so that's not a
 
05:15:06.160 --> 05:15:07.510 align:start position:0%
and so that's not a
expulsion

05:15:07.510 --> 05:15:07.520 align:start position:0%
expulsion
 
05:15:09.510 --> 05:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
but i i would have no objection i didn't
 
05:15:11.110 --> 05:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
think about having that in when i
 
05:15:13.270 --> 05:15:13.280 align:start position:0%
drafted this amendment but i would see
 
05:15:14.868 --> 05:15:14.878 align:start position:0%
no problem with it because that's the
 
05:15:16.070 --> 05:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
intent and that's how it's already
 
05:15:17.270 --> 05:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
treated so we wouldn't really be
 
05:15:19.430 --> 05:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
changing anything all right
 
05:15:22.708 --> 05:15:22.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:26.150 --> 05:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i i apologize but i'm
 
05:15:27.830 --> 05:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
really confused here
 
05:15:29.510 --> 05:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
it seems like
 
05:15:31.590 --> 05:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
the law already exists that the children
 
05:15:32.550 --> 05:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
need to be
 
05:15:32.560 --> 05:15:33.750 align:start position:0%
need to be
tested

05:15:33.750 --> 05:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
tested
 
05:15:35.510 --> 05:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
and that the local school authorities
 
05:15:37.590 --> 05:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
need to
 
05:15:39.670 --> 05:15:39.680 align:start position:0%
report that
 
05:15:41.510 --> 05:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
i mean i'll read the sentence the
 
05:15:42.550 --> 05:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
results of the child's physical
 
05:15:44.390 --> 05:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
examinations shall be presented to the
 
05:15:45.750 --> 05:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
local school officials on a form
 
05:15:49.110 --> 05:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
provided by the local school authorities
 
05:15:51.350 --> 05:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
so i'm curious as to why we need a new
 
05:15:51.360 --> 05:15:53.110 align:start position:0%
so i'm curious as to why we need a new
form

05:15:53.110 --> 05:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
form
 
05:15:54.788 --> 05:15:54.798 align:start position:0%
and i'm concerned about representative
 
05:15:57.030 --> 05:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
wallner's point as well they shall be
 
05:15:58.550 --> 05:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
graded i think that means granted six
 
05:16:00.788 --> 05:16:00.798 align:start position:0%
months to remedy the deficiency so the
 
05:16:02.070 --> 05:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
presumption is there that something's
 
05:16:03.190 --> 05:16:03.200 align:start position:0%
going to happen and they don't remedy
 
05:16:04.550 --> 05:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
the deficiency
 
05:16:06.390 --> 05:16:06.400 align:start position:0%
and then in the next line it basically
 
05:16:07.990 --> 05:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
they're allow the parents can basically
 
05:16:09.670 --> 05:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
opt out yes
 
05:16:09.680 --> 05:16:11.670 align:start position:0%
opt out yes
so

05:16:11.670 --> 05:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:16:13.750 --> 05:16:13.760 align:start position:0%
what is the end why are we doing all why
 
05:16:14.948 --> 05:16:14.958 align:start position:0%
are we putting the school officials
 
05:16:16.070 --> 05:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
through all this if they're already
 
05:16:17.670 --> 05:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
basically doing everything including the
 
05:16:19.830 --> 05:16:19.840 align:start position:0%
testing but but they're not that's the
 
05:16:22.390 --> 05:16:22.400 align:start position:0%
point the what this the the bold is the
 
05:16:24.070 --> 05:16:24.080 align:start position:0%
new language the other language is
 
05:16:25.510 --> 05:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
what's in statute that has to do with
 
05:16:27.430 --> 05:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
this the standard physical examination
 
05:16:29.590 --> 05:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
and other things such as immunization
 
05:16:31.830 --> 05:16:31.840 align:start position:0%
that currently exists
 
05:16:33.910 --> 05:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
the reason for this is that the lead
 
05:16:35.670 --> 05:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
testing requirement went into effect
 
05:16:37.670 --> 05:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
again it was a result of legislation in
 
05:16:40.390 --> 05:16:40.400 align:start position:0%
2018 but the compliance rate has been
 
05:16:42.230 --> 05:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
relatively low now part of that is
 
05:16:44.070 --> 05:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
because we've also had a little problem
 
05:16:45.430 --> 05:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
with the thing called code for the last
 
05:16:46.708 --> 05:16:46.718 align:start position:0%
couple of years that is certainly
 
05:16:48.150 --> 05:16:48.160 align:start position:0%
interfered with
 
05:16:49.590 --> 05:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
people getting to their pediatrician and
 
05:16:51.830 --> 05:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
getting blood tests done and so on and
 
05:16:53.270 --> 05:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
so forth but the compliance has been
 
05:16:55.830 --> 05:16:55.840 align:start position:0%
relatively poor comparison to what it
 
05:16:58.230 --> 05:16:58.240 align:start position:0%
should be the initial bill had all kinds
 
05:16:59.910 --> 05:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
of reporting requirements from the
 
05:17:02.390 --> 05:17:02.400 align:start position:0%
schools as to how many people had been
 
05:17:04.788 --> 05:17:04.798 align:start position:0%
tested from the providers all those are
 
05:17:06.070 --> 05:17:06.080 align:start position:0%
the things that generated the fiscal
 
05:17:07.510 --> 05:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
note and it's for that reason that the
 
05:17:09.990 --> 05:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
amendment got rid of all of that stuff
 
05:17:11.670 --> 05:17:11.680 align:start position:0%
but the point is this is at a point of
 
05:17:13.750 --> 05:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
contact where a child enters into a
 
05:17:15.990 --> 05:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
system of either child care or school as
 
05:17:17.510 --> 05:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
a reminder that you know it's really
 
05:17:19.830 --> 05:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
important your kid get tested for lead
 
05:17:21.590 --> 05:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
and that was the reason this was put in
 
05:17:23.910 --> 05:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
because the the blood testing
 
05:17:23.920 --> 05:17:25.110 align:start position:0%
because the the blood testing
is

05:17:25.110 --> 05:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:17:25.120 --> 05:17:25.990 align:start position:0%
is
not

05:17:25.990 --> 05:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:17:26.000 --> 05:17:27.190 align:start position:0%
not
required

05:17:27.190 --> 05:17:27.200 align:start position:0%
required
 
05:17:27.200 --> 05:17:28.470 align:start position:0%
required
explicitly

05:17:28.470 --> 05:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
explicitly
 
05:17:30.150 --> 05:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
for the school thing i mean they want to
 
05:17:31.990 --> 05:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
have the form but we didn't ever say
 
05:17:33.910 --> 05:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
that for the child care they have to
 
05:17:36.708 --> 05:17:36.718 align:start position:0%
have the lead testing done even though
 
05:17:38.230 --> 05:17:38.240 align:start position:0%
it should be this is just a way to try
 
05:17:40.868 --> 05:17:40.878 align:start position:0%
to improve compliance with the testing
 
05:17:42.708 --> 05:17:42.718 align:start position:0%
follow-up yeah
 
05:17:44.550 --> 05:17:44.560 align:start position:0%
i thought i heard you state that the
 
05:17:47.350 --> 05:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
form the the current form
 
05:17:50.070 --> 05:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
already contains the blood level testing
 
05:17:52.948 --> 05:17:52.958 align:start position:0%
checkbox or whatever it is on it
 
05:17:54.868 --> 05:17:54.878 align:start position:0%
it yes sir it does it but they're not
 
05:17:57.430 --> 05:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
required to have necessarily uh filled
 
05:17:59.750 --> 05:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
that in in the past the goal was to make
 
05:18:01.830 --> 05:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
sure that that is actually done in other
 
05:18:04.788 --> 05:18:04.798 align:start position:0%
words there was no
 
05:18:06.150 --> 05:18:06.160 align:start position:0%
there was no sort of checking to be
 
05:18:07.670 --> 05:18:07.680 align:start position:0%
served it actually had gotten carried
 
05:18:09.430 --> 05:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
out as far as lead testing whereas we
 
05:18:11.190 --> 05:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
already have the immunization and
 
05:18:13.990 --> 05:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
statute that's pretty clear so
 
05:18:15.350 --> 05:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
i think that was the whole goal of this
 
05:18:17.030 --> 05:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
if if i understand
 
05:18:19.590 --> 05:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
but perhaps mrone could discuss that
 
05:18:19.600 --> 05:18:23.670 align:start position:0%
but perhaps mrone could discuss that
better

05:18:23.670 --> 05:18:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:25.510 --> 05:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
so you're accurate the form already
 
05:18:28.150 --> 05:18:28.160 align:start position:0%
exists with the blood lead the space on
 
05:18:29.510 --> 05:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
the form for the blood lead to be
 
05:18:31.750 --> 05:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
checked off that has been
 
05:18:33.350 --> 05:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
been performed
 
05:18:36.150 --> 05:18:36.160 align:start position:0%
but the schools aren't um
 
05:18:37.670 --> 05:18:37.680 align:start position:0%
they're looking at the immunizations and
 
05:18:39.750 --> 05:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
not so much looking at the lead form the
 
05:18:42.230 --> 05:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
lead check box so what what this would
 
05:18:43.910 --> 05:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
do is it would
 
05:18:45.910 --> 05:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
have the schools look at the entirety of
 
05:18:47.590 --> 05:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
the form to make sure that child had a
 
05:18:48.948 --> 05:18:48.958 align:start position:0%
blood lead
 
05:18:50.628 --> 05:18:50.638 align:start position:0%
blood level test
 
05:18:52.390 --> 05:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
with the goal of increasing testing
 
05:18:54.788 --> 05:18:54.798 align:start position:0%
rates and if parents had a child going
 
05:18:56.150 --> 05:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
into kindergarten or first grade that
 
05:18:57.910 --> 05:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
had a blood test they would know that
 
05:18:59.830 --> 05:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
their younger children also need a blood
 
05:18:59.840 --> 05:19:00.948 align:start position:0%
their younger children also need a blood
test

05:19:00.948 --> 05:19:00.958 align:start position:0%
test
 
05:19:02.788 --> 05:19:02.798 align:start position:0%
yeah so it's to increase awareness and
 
05:19:05.350 --> 05:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
to improve testing rates
 
05:19:07.270 --> 05:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
follow-up go ahead
 
05:19:10.628 --> 05:19:10.638 align:start position:0%
so how are you going to inform
 
05:19:14.310 --> 05:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
the schools of this this becomes law how
 
05:19:16.150 --> 05:19:16.160 align:start position:0%
are you going to inform the schools that
 
05:19:24.628 --> 05:19:24.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:25.990 --> 05:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
i think that we would work with the
 
05:19:27.750 --> 05:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
department of education
 
05:19:30.150 --> 05:19:30.160 align:start position:0%
to do a press release news release and
 
05:19:31.830 --> 05:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
some education to the school nurse we'd
 
05:19:33.430 --> 05:19:33.440 align:start position:0%
work with the school nurse association
 
05:19:35.430 --> 05:19:35.440 align:start position:0%
which we already collaborate and partner
 
05:19:36.788 --> 05:19:36.798 align:start position:0%
with now
 
05:19:36.798 --> 05:19:37.990 align:start position:0%
with now
follow-up

05:19:37.990 --> 05:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
05:19:39.030 --> 05:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
so you'll probably see where i'm going
 
05:19:39.990 --> 05:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
with this
 
05:19:41.510 --> 05:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
why don't you just do that why do you
 
05:19:41.520 --> 05:19:42.390 align:start position:0%
why don't you just do that why do you
need

05:19:42.390 --> 05:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
need
 
05:19:44.390 --> 05:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
a bill why don't you just inform the
 
05:19:46.230 --> 05:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
schools that you'd like them to actually
 
05:19:47.830 --> 05:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
pay attention to that check box that
 
05:19:49.590 --> 05:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
already exists and apparently pay
 
05:19:51.030 --> 05:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
attention to the law regarding lead
 
05:19:53.510 --> 05:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
testing that already exists
 
05:19:59.990 --> 05:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:01.830 --> 05:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
so the department is neutral on this
 
05:20:01.840 --> 05:20:03.190 align:start position:0%
so the department is neutral on this
bill

05:20:03.190 --> 05:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:20:05.350 --> 05:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
and so we would
 
05:20:08.150 --> 05:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
we would encourage any opportunities to
 
05:20:11.430 --> 05:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
increase testing rates as possible
 
05:20:11.440 --> 05:20:14.550 align:start position:0%
increase testing rates as possible
and

05:20:14.550 --> 05:20:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:17.510 --> 05:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry can you repeat your question
 
05:20:19.750 --> 05:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
let me say it in my own way
 
05:20:19.760 --> 05:20:21.030 align:start position:0%
let me say it in my own way
i

05:20:21.030 --> 05:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:20:22.868 --> 05:20:22.878 align:start position:0%
it seems like
 
05:20:24.470 --> 05:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
everything that you need from a
 
05:20:27.190 --> 05:20:27.200 align:start position:0%
statutory perspective is in place and
 
05:20:29.110 --> 05:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
from an administrative perspective the
 
05:20:31.590 --> 05:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
form is already available
 
05:20:34.070 --> 05:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
the requirement to do lead testing is
 
05:20:34.080 --> 05:20:35.270 align:start position:0%
the requirement to do lead testing is
there

05:20:35.270 --> 05:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:20:35.280 --> 05:20:36.390 align:start position:0%
there
so

05:20:36.390 --> 05:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:20:39.350 --> 05:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
we have a training and compliance issue
 
05:20:42.150 --> 05:20:42.160 align:start position:0%
we don't have a statutory issue it seems
 
05:20:43.190 --> 05:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
to me
 
05:20:43.200 --> 05:20:44.230 align:start position:0%
to me
so

05:20:44.230 --> 05:20:44.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:20:46.548 --> 05:20:46.558 align:start position:0%
why couldn't this problem be solved
 
05:20:48.390 --> 05:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
instead of with this
 
05:20:50.150 --> 05:20:50.160 align:start position:0%
change to a statute
 
05:20:52.628 --> 05:20:52.638 align:start position:0%
and instead be solved by just better
 
05:20:52.638 --> 05:20:55.430 align:start position:0%
and instead be solved by just better
training

05:20:55.430 --> 05:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:57.990 --> 05:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
you know the department is does do uh
 
05:21:00.708 --> 05:21:00.718 align:start position:0%
coordinated reach outreach to physicians
 
05:21:02.868 --> 05:21:02.878 align:start position:0%
and to schools where we can this is just
 
05:21:06.150 --> 05:21:06.160 align:start position:0%
another opportunity to increase
 
05:21:09.750 --> 05:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
the awareness that this is an important
 
05:21:11.990 --> 05:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
public health issue and to make sure
 
05:21:14.230 --> 05:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
that parents at the local level they're
 
05:21:16.230 --> 05:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
getting that another
 
05:21:18.470 --> 05:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
communication with the schools around
 
05:21:20.868 --> 05:21:20.878 align:start position:0%
the importance of lead testing so have
 
05:21:24.628 --> 05:21:24.638 align:start position:0%
we have we tried in better training and
 
05:21:28.150 --> 05:21:28.160 align:start position:0%
because i just hate going to the club of
 
05:21:28.160 --> 05:21:28.868 align:start position:0%
because i just hate going to the club of
all

05:21:28.868 --> 05:21:28.878 align:start position:0%
all
 
05:21:30.548 --> 05:21:30.558 align:start position:0%
additional laws
 
05:21:32.708 --> 05:21:32.718 align:start position:0%
when everything's already in place and
 
05:21:35.270 --> 05:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
we just need to do more training if have
 
05:21:37.110 --> 05:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
we tried the better training approach
 
05:21:41.510 --> 05:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:44.150 --> 05:21:44.160 align:start position:0%
so we've had a full-time health educator
 
05:21:47.110 --> 05:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
on staff since 2015 working with health
 
05:21:49.590 --> 05:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
care providers our hud agencies our
 
05:21:51.110 --> 05:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
school districts our school nurse
 
05:21:53.510 --> 05:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
associations and our testing rates for
 
05:21:55.990 --> 05:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
one-year rolls is in the 60 percent dial
 
05:21:57.510 --> 05:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
right now
 
05:21:59.110 --> 05:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
all right representative
 
05:22:01.590 --> 05:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
yeah just to answer representatives
 
05:22:01.600 --> 05:22:02.548 align:start position:0%
yeah just to answer representatives
question

05:22:02.548 --> 05:22:02.558 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:22:04.708 --> 05:22:04.718 align:start position:0%
in terms of why is it different
 
05:22:06.070 --> 05:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
we're actually trying to treat this so
 
05:22:07.590 --> 05:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
it is the same if we look at
 
05:22:09.830 --> 05:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
immunization yes we have a law that you
 
05:22:11.750 --> 05:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
have to be immunized unless you have an
 
05:22:15.350 --> 05:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
exemption to it but in 141 c 20 section
 
05:22:15.360 --> 05:22:16.230 align:start position:0%
exemption to it but in 141 c 20 section
two

05:22:16.230 --> 05:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
two
 
05:22:18.150 --> 05:22:18.160 align:start position:0%
it says no child shall be admitted or
 
05:22:19.910 --> 05:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
enrolled to a school or child care
 
05:22:21.830 --> 05:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
agency unless they are immunized as
 
05:22:24.070 --> 05:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
listed under paragraph one so the point
 
05:22:26.868 --> 05:22:26.878 align:start position:0%
is in statute we say yes you got it be
 
05:22:29.590 --> 05:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
immunized here we also then add and if
 
05:22:30.868 --> 05:22:30.878 align:start position:0%
you're going to enter a school or child
 
05:22:30.878 --> 05:22:31.910 align:start position:0%
you're going to enter a school or child
care

05:22:31.910 --> 05:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
care
 
05:22:33.830 --> 05:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
we need to be immunized so here we have
 
05:22:35.110 --> 05:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
a statute that says you have to be
 
05:22:37.350 --> 05:22:37.360 align:start position:0%
tested for lead got it but there is no
 
05:22:39.430 --> 05:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
correlating statute that says and to be
 
05:22:41.430 --> 05:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
entered into a child care or school you
 
05:22:43.430 --> 05:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
have to be tested for lead so indeed we
 
05:22:45.590 --> 05:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
are trying to make the lead testing
 
05:22:47.990 --> 05:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
just like the immunization so the point
 
05:22:49.510 --> 05:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
is the difference is
 
05:22:51.190 --> 05:22:51.200 align:start position:0%
that right now they do have it on the
 
05:22:52.708 --> 05:22:52.718 align:start position:0%
health forum against because you know
 
05:22:54.230 --> 05:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
from a provider's point of view you
 
05:22:55.510 --> 05:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
don't want a gazillion forms you want
 
05:22:57.190 --> 05:22:57.200 align:start position:0%
one form for the kid that kind of covers
 
05:22:58.310 --> 05:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
everything it covers things like
 
05:22:59.830 --> 05:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
allergies and
 
05:23:01.670 --> 05:23:01.680 align:start position:0%
eating problems and all that kind of
 
05:23:03.750 --> 05:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
stuff is on these kind of forms but the
 
05:23:05.590 --> 05:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
issue is that
 
05:23:08.070 --> 05:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
the providers the school sorry sorry the
 
05:23:09.590 --> 05:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
school or the child care need to check
 
05:23:11.030 --> 05:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
that they've got the immunizations this
 
05:23:12.948 --> 05:23:12.958 align:start position:0%
is just asking them to also check that
 
05:23:15.190 --> 05:23:15.200 align:start position:0%
they've got the lead so it makes it
 
05:23:17.270 --> 05:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
exactly analogous to how we do treat
 
05:23:19.110 --> 05:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
immunization so this does make it
 
05:23:21.030 --> 05:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
consistent with our previous efforts in
 
05:23:21.040 --> 05:23:22.470 align:start position:0%
consistent with our previous efforts in
immunization

05:23:22.470 --> 05:23:22.480 align:start position:0%
immunization
 
05:23:23.670 --> 05:23:23.680 align:start position:0%
it doesn't add something that is
 
05:23:23.680 --> 05:23:25.190 align:start position:0%
it doesn't add something that is
different

05:23:25.190 --> 05:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
different
 
05:23:27.270 --> 05:23:27.280 align:start position:0%
so this sounds contradictory to me
 
05:23:27.280 --> 05:23:28.150 align:start position:0%
so this sounds contradictory to me
because

05:23:28.150 --> 05:23:28.160 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:23:30.390 --> 05:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
we had a sidebar that representative
 
05:23:32.150 --> 05:23:32.160 align:start position:0%
wallner started to say
 
05:23:34.548 --> 05:23:34.558 align:start position:0%
we don't we don't want this to be
 
05:23:37.430 --> 05:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
punitive we don't want to keep kids out
 
05:23:40.070 --> 05:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
of these facilities for the lack of lead
 
05:23:43.190 --> 05:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
testing but i think i just heard you say
 
05:23:45.510 --> 05:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
that we can keep kids out of school and
 
05:23:47.910 --> 05:23:47.920 align:start position:0%
child care facilities if they've not
 
05:23:49.510 --> 05:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
been immunized
 
05:23:51.350 --> 05:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
and now you're making a case that they
 
05:23:52.470 --> 05:23:52.480 align:start position:0%
should be
 
05:23:56.230 --> 05:23:56.240 align:start position:0%
now exactly analogous to one another so
 
05:23:58.470 --> 05:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
if that's the case then that means there
 
05:24:00.868 --> 05:24:00.878 align:start position:0%
is a punitive component of not doing the
 
05:24:02.548 --> 05:24:02.558 align:start position:0%
lead testing could you could you
 
05:24:04.548 --> 05:24:04.558 align:start position:0%
straighten me out on that
 
05:24:06.390 --> 05:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
i think the point you make
 
05:24:08.150 --> 05:24:08.160 align:start position:0%
is interesting and i hadn't thought
 
05:24:09.910 --> 05:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
about that and i but i still don't view
 
05:24:12.070 --> 05:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
it as really punitive because it's not
 
05:24:14.230 --> 05:24:14.240 align:start position:0%
the goal still would be the licensing
 
05:24:15.190 --> 05:24:15.200 align:start position:0%
people have said is they're going to
 
05:24:17.190 --> 05:24:17.200 align:start position:0%
treat it like immunization which is they
 
05:24:18.708 --> 05:24:18.718 align:start position:0%
don't throw a kid out of child care they
 
05:24:20.708 --> 05:24:20.718 align:start position:0%
ask him to get it corrected and remember
 
05:24:22.788 --> 05:24:22.798 align:start position:0%
just as an immunization and then testing
 
05:24:28.708 --> 05:24:28.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:30.070 --> 05:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
well i certainly
 
05:24:30.080 --> 05:24:31.190 align:start position:0%
well i certainly
support

05:24:31.190 --> 05:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
support
 
05:24:31.200 --> 05:24:34.150 align:start position:0%
support
the

05:24:34.150 --> 05:24:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:36.470 --> 05:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
what's why we have the bill in front of
 
05:24:38.548 --> 05:24:38.558 align:start position:0%
us i guess i just want to be sure
 
05:24:39.750 --> 05:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
i guess i would just like to have a
 
05:24:42.948 --> 05:24:42.958 align:start position:0%
sentence in there saying that um
 
05:24:46.070 --> 05:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
you know a child cannot be removed from
 
05:24:47.830 --> 05:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
child care if they don't have the lead
 
05:24:47.840 --> 05:24:48.708 align:start position:0%
child care if they don't have the lead
test

05:24:48.708 --> 05:24:48.718 align:start position:0%
test
 
05:24:51.110 --> 05:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
i understand the immunization because if
 
05:24:54.070 --> 05:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
you have a child who's not immunized
 
05:24:57.110 --> 05:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
and then that child
 
05:24:57.120 --> 05:24:58.310 align:start position:0%
and then that child
gets

05:24:58.310 --> 05:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
gets
 
05:24:58.320 --> 05:24:59.430 align:start position:0%
gets
whatever

05:24:59.430 --> 05:24:59.440 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
05:25:01.830 --> 05:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
thing they've been immunized against
 
05:25:04.310 --> 05:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
or not against and then it spreads to
 
05:25:05.590 --> 05:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
the other children
 
05:25:07.670 --> 05:25:07.680 align:start position:0%
the lead testing's a little different it
 
05:25:09.830 --> 05:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't spread to other children
 
05:25:12.310 --> 05:25:12.320 align:start position:0%
so if we could just be sure that can't
 
05:25:15.110 --> 05:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
be used just the lead testing can't be
 
05:25:17.590 --> 05:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
used as a reason
 
05:25:19.670 --> 05:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
to have a family not be able to have
 
05:25:22.310 --> 05:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
their child in child care okay earlier
 
05:25:24.708 --> 05:25:24.718 align:start position:0%
you said they should not be removed but
 
05:25:27.190 --> 05:25:27.200 align:start position:0%
i think what we're also needing to just
 
05:25:28.628 --> 05:25:28.638 align:start position:0%
put a pin in
 
05:25:31.750 --> 05:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
is they neither should they be denied a
 
05:25:35.270 --> 05:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
slot or entry or enrollment into a
 
05:25:37.430 --> 05:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
program because of the lead testing
 
05:25:40.230 --> 05:25:40.240 align:start position:0%
right right and actually uh sure may i
 
05:25:42.070 --> 05:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
yeah and actually it none of the it
 
05:25:44.548 --> 05:25:44.558 align:start position:0%
doesn't to deny that's why there's this
 
05:25:46.230 --> 05:25:46.240 align:start position:0%
and again that was a typo that uh
 
05:25:47.990 --> 05:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
representative picked up as graded as
 
05:25:50.390 --> 05:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
granted actually yes it was a typo that
 
05:25:52.310 --> 05:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
they have the six months but i agree i'm
 
05:25:53.590 --> 05:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
very comfortable with the idea of
 
05:25:55.590 --> 05:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
putting in that it is not a cause to
 
05:25:57.510 --> 05:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
dismiss a child just because
 
05:25:58.868 --> 05:25:58.878 align:start position:0%
the licensing
 
05:26:00.948 --> 05:26:00.958 align:start position:0%
or deny yeah but just because the
 
05:26:03.270 --> 05:26:03.280 align:start position:0%
licensing agency says they would not do
 
05:26:05.030 --> 05:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
that i think having it in statute makes
 
05:26:06.868 --> 05:26:06.878 align:start position:0%
it safer so i completely agree with
 
05:26:08.708 --> 05:26:08.718 align:start position:0%
representative walner and i'm
 
05:26:10.230 --> 05:26:10.240 align:start position:0%
comfortable with adding deny i think
 
05:26:14.150 --> 05:26:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:15.990 --> 05:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
i had representative
 
05:26:18.470 --> 05:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
i have two questions
 
05:26:21.190 --> 05:26:21.200 align:start position:0%
how prevalent is
 
05:26:23.110 --> 05:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
this affliction of
 
05:26:25.430 --> 05:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
children having led and how much does
 
05:26:25.440 --> 05:26:26.628 align:start position:0%
children having led and how much does
the

05:26:26.628 --> 05:26:26.638 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:26:31.030 --> 05:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:34.548 --> 05:26:34.558 align:start position:0%
so in our last uh bill in 2018 we made
 
05:26:35.750 --> 05:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
it so that
 
05:26:37.510 --> 05:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage for blood lead
 
05:26:39.590 --> 05:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
testing was mandatory that no insurance
 
05:26:43.190 --> 05:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
company could deny a child
 
05:26:45.030 --> 05:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
it costs a health care provider
 
05:26:47.350 --> 05:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
approximately 32 dollars which they're
 
05:26:47.360 --> 05:26:49.510 align:start position:0%
approximately 32 dollars which they're
reimbursed

05:26:49.510 --> 05:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
reimbursed
 
05:26:51.750 --> 05:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
from the insurance company
 
05:26:53.430 --> 05:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
so that's your first question then you
 
05:26:55.590 --> 05:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to know how many children in new
 
05:26:55.600 --> 05:26:56.868 align:start position:0%
wanted to know how many children in new
hampshire

05:26:56.868 --> 05:26:56.878 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
05:26:59.110 --> 05:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
what percentage what percentage of
 
05:27:01.750 --> 05:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
children tested so we had i'm looking
 
05:27:03.910 --> 05:27:03.920 align:start position:0%
here through my recent data
 
05:27:08.310 --> 05:27:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:12.150 --> 05:27:12.160 align:start position:0%
682 children last year who had elevated
 
05:27:14.070 --> 05:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
blood lead levels over five micrograms
 
05:27:17.670 --> 05:27:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:18.708 --> 05:27:18.718 align:start position:0%
so the
 
05:27:21.510 --> 05:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
the so that represents approximately one
 
05:27:24.628 --> 05:27:24.638 align:start position:0%
half of one percent of all students dude
 
05:27:26.628 --> 05:27:26.638 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i don't have that at my
 
05:27:29.110 --> 05:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
fingertips i can find that data for you
 
05:27:31.510 --> 05:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
so you're asking me of all the children
 
05:27:34.230 --> 05:27:34.240 align:start position:0%
who enter into kindergarten what percent
 
05:27:35.910 --> 05:27:35.920 align:start position:0%
would have an elevated blood lead i can
 
05:27:37.510 --> 05:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
find that out for you
 
05:27:39.990 --> 05:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
okay if it's phrased that way as opposed
 
05:27:43.590 --> 05:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
to all kids then the numbers sounds like
 
05:27:45.510 --> 05:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
it's probably more
 
05:27:45.520 --> 05:27:46.788 align:start position:0%
it's probably more
around

05:27:46.788 --> 05:27:46.798 align:start position:0%
around
 
05:27:46.798 --> 05:27:47.670 align:start position:0%
around
uh

05:27:47.670 --> 05:27:47.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:27:49.990 --> 05:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
10 or 12 percent so what i can tell you
 
05:27:52.230 --> 05:27:52.240 align:start position:0%
is 40 percent of the children who are in
 
05:27:55.590 --> 05:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
k-12 right now here in new hampshire 40
 
05:27:57.910 --> 05:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
of those children have had an elevated
 
05:27:59.910 --> 05:27:59.920 align:start position:0%
blood lead test at some point in their
 
05:27:59.920 --> 05:28:01.910 align:start position:0%
blood lead test at some point in their
lives

05:28:01.910 --> 05:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
lives
 
05:28:04.548 --> 05:28:04.558 align:start position:0%
okay and you said that commercial to
 
05:28:06.548 --> 05:28:06.558 align:start position:0%
representative wilder's question you you
 
05:28:07.670 --> 05:28:07.680 align:start position:0%
said that
 
05:28:10.390 --> 05:28:10.400 align:start position:0%
uh commercial insurance reimburses the
 
05:28:13.270 --> 05:28:13.280 align:start position:0%
32 dollars okay but i think only 60
 
05:28:15.670 --> 05:28:15.680 align:start position:0%
percent or 60 percent of new hampshire
 
05:28:17.910 --> 05:28:17.920 align:start position:0%
kids or thereabouts is covered by
 
05:28:19.510 --> 05:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
commercial insurance
 
05:28:21.990 --> 05:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
so who's paying for the other 40 percent
 
05:28:24.070 --> 05:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
so children who are insured by medicaid
 
05:28:26.788 --> 05:28:26.798 align:start position:0%
anthem tufts blue cross blue shield all
 
05:28:28.628 --> 05:28:28.638 align:start position:0%
the insurance carriers those insurance
 
05:28:28.638 --> 05:28:29.750 align:start position:0%
the insurance carriers those insurance
carriers

05:28:29.750 --> 05:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
carriers
 
05:28:31.430 --> 05:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
have to
 
05:28:34.070 --> 05:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
cover the cost we have the wic clinics
 
05:28:35.670 --> 05:28:35.680 align:start position:0%
who are doing blood lead testing for
 
05:28:37.190 --> 05:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
children who might not have a medical
 
05:28:39.430 --> 05:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
home that should that blood testing is
 
05:28:41.030 --> 05:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
provided free of charge to those
 
05:28:41.040 --> 05:28:42.548 align:start position:0%
provided free of charge to those
children

05:28:42.548 --> 05:28:42.558 align:start position:0%
children
 
05:28:43.910 --> 05:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
do you have a follow-up representative
 
05:28:43.920 --> 05:28:45.270 align:start position:0%
do you have a follow-up representative
weiler

05:28:45.270 --> 05:28:45.280 align:start position:0%
weiler
 
05:28:49.830 --> 05:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:50.868 --> 05:28:50.878 align:start position:0%
representative kenner do you have
 
05:28:52.708 --> 05:28:52.718 align:start position:0%
another question or comment uh comment i
 
05:28:54.070 --> 05:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
was trying to find the information i
 
05:28:55.430 --> 05:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
don't have it right now but basically
 
05:28:57.990 --> 05:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
it's important to understand and we
 
05:28:59.830 --> 05:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
both edwards and i spent a long time
 
05:29:01.510 --> 05:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
listening to this when we had the lead
 
05:29:04.868 --> 05:29:04.878 align:start position:0%
bill 247 back in 18.
 
05:29:06.230 --> 05:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has the oldest housing
 
05:29:07.750 --> 05:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
stock in the nation which and of course
 
05:29:09.350 --> 05:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
the housing and the lead paint is the
 
05:29:11.510 --> 05:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
primary source of lead poisoning but
 
05:29:14.150 --> 05:29:14.160 align:start position:0%
also it does come about from
 
05:29:16.470 --> 05:29:16.480 align:start position:0%
contamination in the soil as well
 
05:29:18.788 --> 05:29:18.798 align:start position:0%
and it leads to incredible problems with
 
05:29:21.510 --> 05:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
children if in terms of learning issues
 
05:29:24.788 --> 05:29:24.798 align:start position:0%
and behavioral issues and so on and is a
 
05:29:26.868 --> 05:29:26.878 align:start position:0%
incredibly important preventable
 
05:29:26.878 --> 05:29:27.910 align:start position:0%
incredibly important preventable
illness

05:29:27.910 --> 05:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
illness
 
05:29:27.920 --> 05:29:28.708 align:start position:0%
illness
the

05:29:28.708 --> 05:29:28.718 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:29:31.910 --> 05:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
point is that many many children can be
 
05:29:34.230 --> 05:29:34.240 align:start position:0%
exposed and the problem is trying to
 
05:29:35.830 --> 05:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
pick them up early when we can treat
 
05:29:38.948 --> 05:29:38.958 align:start position:0%
them and chelate out the lead and also
 
05:29:40.470 --> 05:29:40.480 align:start position:0%
then we may know that there's a younger
 
05:29:42.150 --> 05:29:42.160 align:start position:0%
sibling who can then be protected by
 
05:29:45.430 --> 05:29:45.440 align:start position:0%
remediation and part of sb247 was money
 
05:29:47.830 --> 05:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
to help remediate the housing stock when
 
05:29:50.230 --> 05:29:50.240 align:start position:0%
necessary it's going to cost i think the
 
05:29:51.750 --> 05:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
estimate was somewhere close to a
 
05:29:53.990 --> 05:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
billion with a b to remediate all the
 
05:29:55.830 --> 05:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
high-risk housing costs in the state so
 
05:29:57.910 --> 05:29:57.920 align:start position:0%
we're not we can't just scatter shot do
 
05:29:59.590 --> 05:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
it um
 
05:30:01.590 --> 05:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
so though it may be a small amount it's
 
05:30:03.590 --> 05:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
extremely important as far as a
 
05:30:05.750 --> 05:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
screening test and that's why it was
 
05:30:08.390 --> 05:30:08.400 align:start position:0%
passed in 2018 and that's why
 
05:30:10.548 --> 05:30:10.558 align:start position:0%
this drone is here
 
05:30:13.270 --> 05:30:13.280 align:start position:0%
so so i'll tell you why i'm unconvinced
 
05:30:15.430 --> 05:30:15.440 align:start position:0%
at this point i'm unconvinced at this
 
05:30:17.750 --> 05:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
point because it sounds like everything
 
05:30:20.470 --> 05:30:20.480 align:start position:0%
that's needed legislatively is already
 
05:30:22.470 --> 05:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
in place and what we're missing is the
 
05:30:24.070 --> 05:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
training component
 
05:30:25.830 --> 05:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
that that we're looking for a reason to
 
05:30:27.670 --> 05:30:27.680 align:start position:0%
go out and train them to do what they're
 
05:30:29.510 --> 05:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
already should be doing
 
05:30:32.150 --> 05:30:32.160 align:start position:0%
and i i i'm just reluctant to pass
 
05:30:33.910 --> 05:30:33.920 align:start position:0%
additional laws
 
05:30:35.750 --> 05:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
rational people will act in their
 
05:30:37.830 --> 05:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
self-interests if they knew how
 
05:30:40.948 --> 05:30:40.958 align:start position:0%
important this lead testing was uh and
 
05:30:42.708 --> 05:30:42.718 align:start position:0%
and and that
 
05:30:44.788 --> 05:30:44.798 align:start position:0%
the schools needed to look for that
 
05:30:46.948 --> 05:30:46.958 align:start position:0%
bubble that's filled out on the form and
 
05:30:48.230 --> 05:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
report it
 
05:30:52.390 --> 05:30:52.400 align:start position:0%
uh i i i just i just don't see the value
 
05:30:56.310 --> 05:30:56.320 align:start position:0%
of adding to the thickness of our rsas
 
05:30:58.310 --> 05:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
may i respond the point is the schools
 
05:31:00.310 --> 05:31:00.320 align:start position:0%
are not currently required to do that
 
05:31:02.390 --> 05:31:02.400 align:start position:0%
again they are for immunizations the
 
05:31:04.070 --> 05:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
fact that it exists on the form is
 
05:31:06.070 --> 05:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
because the provider just say we don't
 
05:31:07.430 --> 05:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
tell them that they need to check is
 
05:31:09.110 --> 05:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
there does the kid have an allergy
 
05:31:10.708 --> 05:31:10.718 align:start position:0%
that's on the form
 
05:31:13.430 --> 05:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
what we're asking is what this bill asks
 
05:31:15.030 --> 05:31:15.040 align:start position:0%
is that they would actually check it
 
05:31:16.788 --> 05:31:16.798 align:start position:0%
because the schools and child cares are
 
05:31:19.110 --> 05:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
not required to check it it's just the
 
05:31:21.030 --> 05:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
the spot exists on the form but the
 
05:31:23.110 --> 05:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
provider may not fill it out
 
05:31:24.948 --> 05:31:24.958 align:start position:0%
or the child may not have been tested
 
05:31:27.110 --> 05:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
and nobody knows that nobody picks up on
 
05:31:29.750 --> 05:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
it because it currently is not
 
05:31:31.830 --> 05:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
required that they look at it this the
 
05:31:33.110 --> 05:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
whole point of this is to ask them just
 
05:31:35.110 --> 05:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
to take a look at it and say yep lead
 
05:31:36.548 --> 05:31:36.558 align:start position:0%
test was done
 
05:31:40.868 --> 05:31:40.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:43.590 --> 05:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
are there any other comments from or
 
05:31:46.708 --> 05:31:46.718 align:start position:0%
questions from the panel or from anyone
 
05:31:48.628 --> 05:31:48.638 align:start position:0%
in the audience
 
05:31:50.548 --> 05:31:50.558 align:start position:0%
do you two ladies have anything more you
 
05:31:53.430 --> 05:31:53.440 align:start position:0%
want to say you've heard a lot
 
05:31:55.590 --> 05:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
i think that the only adding comment
 
05:31:57.590 --> 05:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
that i would add here today is that
 
05:31:59.590 --> 05:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
other states who have put these policies
 
05:32:02.390 --> 05:32:02.400 align:start position:0%
in place in school it's the data's shown
 
05:32:04.868 --> 05:32:04.878 align:start position:0%
that increases testing rates
 
05:32:07.910 --> 05:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
testing your children early is the only
 
05:32:11.350 --> 05:32:11.360 align:start position:0%
way for an intervention to reverse the
 
05:32:13.590 --> 05:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
the damage of lead poisoning it's an
 
05:32:13.600 --> 05:32:14.708 align:start position:0%
the damage of lead poisoning it's an
invisible

05:32:14.708 --> 05:32:14.718 align:start position:0%
invisible
 
05:32:17.110 --> 05:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
thing that happens it's not self-evident
 
05:32:19.670 --> 05:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
to any parents so you don't know unless
 
05:32:21.510 --> 05:32:21.520 align:start position:0%
you're tested but if you do have early
 
05:32:21.520 --> 05:32:22.868 align:start position:0%
you're tested but if you do have early
intervention

05:32:22.868 --> 05:32:22.878 align:start position:0%
intervention
 
05:32:22.878 --> 05:32:23.670 align:start position:0%
intervention
then

05:32:23.670 --> 05:32:23.680 align:start position:0%
then
 
05:32:26.150 --> 05:32:26.160 align:start position:0%
the damage can be reduced and that child
 
05:32:28.868 --> 05:32:28.878 align:start position:0%
can be back on mainstream and
 
05:32:30.868 --> 05:32:30.878 align:start position:0%
if there's not early intervention
 
05:32:33.510 --> 05:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
there's downstream cost that people
 
05:32:36.230 --> 05:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
don't often see and the downstream cost
 
05:32:38.470 --> 05:32:38.480 align:start position:0%
are to medicaid to the insurance company
 
05:32:40.310 --> 05:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
to the juvenile justice system to
 
05:32:43.110 --> 05:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
special education so what we try to do
 
05:32:45.910 --> 05:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
is we try to test these children early
 
05:32:48.150 --> 05:32:48.160 align:start position:0%
and often so we can get them the
 
05:32:49.750 --> 05:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
intervention that they need so that
 
05:32:52.948 --> 05:32:52.958 align:start position:0%
they're not a lifelong burden on our
 
05:32:54.708 --> 05:32:54.718 align:start position:0%
system here in new hampshire
 
05:32:56.070 --> 05:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
and that's what lead testing is all
 
05:32:58.390 --> 05:32:58.400 align:start position:0%
about would you believe i could agree
 
05:33:00.230 --> 05:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
with a hundred percent of everything you
 
05:33:01.350 --> 05:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
just said
 
05:33:03.430 --> 05:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
and say that you were so powerful in the
 
05:33:04.788 --> 05:33:04.798 align:start position:0%
way you say it
 
05:33:07.350 --> 05:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
that a training program
 
05:33:10.548 --> 05:33:10.558 align:start position:0%
would have people behave rationally and
 
05:33:11.990 --> 05:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
go get the
 
05:33:15.030 --> 05:33:15.040 align:start position:0%
the form isn't compelling behavior the
 
05:33:17.910 --> 05:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
the presence of a form doesn't solve all
 
05:33:20.390 --> 05:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
the downstream problems you said it's
 
05:33:22.948 --> 05:33:22.958 align:start position:0%
it's the act of the parent to take the
 
05:33:25.830 --> 05:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
kid to go get tested and this form isn't
 
05:33:28.230 --> 05:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
going to do that
 
05:33:28.240 --> 05:33:29.350 align:start position:0%
going to do that
anymore

05:33:29.350 --> 05:33:29.360 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
05:33:31.270 --> 05:33:31.280 align:start position:0%
if we compel it because i think that's
 
05:33:32.708 --> 05:33:32.718 align:start position:0%
what we're avoiding
 
05:33:35.910 --> 05:33:35.920 align:start position:0%
this is intended to compel parental
 
05:33:39.750 --> 05:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
behavior that the state expects of them
 
05:33:42.628 --> 05:33:42.638 align:start position:0%
and we're skip we're going from uh we
 
05:33:44.868 --> 05:33:44.878 align:start position:0%
instead of trying to work the voluntary
 
05:33:44.878 --> 05:33:45.830 align:start position:0%
instead of trying to work the voluntary
angle

05:33:45.830 --> 05:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
angle
 
05:33:47.670 --> 05:33:47.680 align:start position:0%
and the rational behavior angle we're
 
05:33:50.788 --> 05:33:50.798 align:start position:0%
going to a compelling the parent
 
05:33:52.548 --> 05:33:52.558 align:start position:0%
and and that's
 
05:33:54.070 --> 05:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
that that's that's what i'm not
 
05:33:57.350 --> 05:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
convinced on and but i may misunderstand
 
05:34:00.548 --> 05:34:00.558 align:start position:0%
this so go ahead representative kenner
 
05:34:02.868 --> 05:34:02.878 align:start position:0%
well one of the problems we've run into
 
05:34:05.350 --> 05:34:05.360 align:start position:0%
is that the very people who are at the
 
05:34:07.910 --> 05:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
greatest risk for lead poisoning
 
05:34:10.948 --> 05:34:10.958 align:start position:0%
live in our worst housing and are often
 
05:34:12.948 --> 05:34:12.958 align:start position:0%
some of the most dysfunctional families
 
05:34:15.110 --> 05:34:15.120 align:start position:0%
or families where their parents are
 
05:34:17.830 --> 05:34:17.840 align:start position:0%
working you know three different jobs
 
05:34:19.590 --> 05:34:19.600 align:start position:0%
and are
 
05:34:20.948 --> 05:34:20.958 align:start position:0%
you you say
 
05:34:22.548 --> 05:34:22.558 align:start position:0%
education you know will
 
05:34:25.270 --> 05:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
encourage proper behavior
 
05:34:27.350 --> 05:34:27.360 align:start position:0%
so let's say they don't behave
 
05:34:28.788 --> 05:34:28.798 align:start position:0%
should the child be punished with a
 
05:34:31.030 --> 05:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
lifelong learning disability because we
 
05:34:33.110 --> 05:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
didn't do our job to reach out to try to
 
05:34:34.708 --> 05:34:34.718 align:start position:0%
help that child
 
05:34:36.868 --> 05:34:36.878 align:start position:0%
and i know that that sounds like
 
05:34:38.628 --> 05:34:38.638 align:start position:0%
you know perhaps we're overstepping our
 
05:34:40.788 --> 05:34:40.798 align:start position:0%
bounds but i don't think we are because
 
05:34:42.548 --> 05:34:42.558 align:start position:0%
not every parent
 
05:34:44.470 --> 05:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
is capable of
 
05:34:46.948 --> 05:34:46.958 align:start position:0%
doing what needs to be done and the
 
05:34:49.270 --> 05:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
point of this again was not compelling
 
05:34:50.708 --> 05:34:50.718 align:start position:0%
but it's another point of contact to
 
05:34:52.390 --> 05:34:52.400 align:start position:0%
remind that's why again i agree 100
 
05:34:53.750 --> 05:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
percent there should be that language in
 
05:34:55.670 --> 05:34:55.680 align:start position:0%
there that says kids don't lose their
 
05:34:57.910 --> 05:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
slot then they can't be denied because
 
05:35:00.548 --> 05:35:00.558 align:start position:0%
the hope of this was simply
 
05:35:02.470 --> 05:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
another point of contact say you know
 
05:35:04.548 --> 05:35:04.558 align:start position:0%
you really need to get this done and
 
05:35:06.548 --> 05:35:06.558 align:start position:0%
again that's not in law currently to
 
05:35:09.350 --> 05:35:09.360 align:start position:0%
make that statement so i think
 
05:35:11.430 --> 05:35:11.440 align:start position:0%
it still could be beneficial
 
05:35:13.350 --> 05:35:13.360 align:start position:0%
um because the
 
05:35:15.990 --> 05:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
i i think if i remember right there the
 
05:35:18.310 --> 05:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
department is working hard on outreach
 
05:35:18.320 --> 05:35:19.270 align:start position:0%
department is working hard on outreach
already

05:35:19.270 --> 05:35:19.280 align:start position:0%
already
 
05:35:21.270 --> 05:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
to those most vulnerable kids because we
 
05:35:22.948 --> 05:35:22.958 align:start position:0%
know that those are the ones at highest
 
05:35:24.310 --> 05:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
risk and they're the ones where the
 
05:35:27.590 --> 05:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
parents are least likely to actually
 
05:35:32.150 --> 05:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:34.230 --> 05:35:34.240 align:start position:0%
so i think you may be projecting
 
05:35:37.510 --> 05:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
benefits of the pro of this law that uh
 
05:35:40.470 --> 05:35:40.480 align:start position:0%
are are theoretical this this law is
 
05:35:40.480 --> 05:35:41.590 align:start position:0%
are are theoretical this this law is
just

05:35:41.590 --> 05:35:41.600 align:start position:0%
just
 
05:35:44.548 --> 05:35:44.558 align:start position:0%
looks like it's setting up to compel the
 
05:35:46.708 --> 05:35:46.718 align:start position:0%
completion of a form
 
05:35:46.718 --> 05:35:48.948 align:start position:0%
completion of a form
um

05:35:48.948 --> 05:35:48.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:35:50.708 --> 05:35:50.718 align:start position:0%
like i said i'm just not convinced that
 
05:35:52.390 --> 05:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
a good training program wouldn't be
 
05:35:54.868 --> 05:35:54.878 align:start position:0%
adequate that that's all
 
05:35:57.030 --> 05:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
one point if i could make is the policy
 
05:35:58.868 --> 05:35:58.878 align:start position:0%
committee passed this 20 to one because
 
05:36:00.150 --> 05:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
we thought it was a good thing although
 
05:36:01.430 --> 05:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
i think the policy committee would
 
05:36:03.110 --> 05:36:03.120 align:start position:0%
perfectly have been happy with what
 
05:36:05.590 --> 05:36:05.600 align:start position:0%
representative walner has said
 
05:36:05.600 --> 05:36:06.628 align:start position:0%
representative walner has said
and

05:36:06.628 --> 05:36:06.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:36:09.190 --> 05:36:09.200 align:start position:0%
the policy committee also amended out
 
05:36:11.350 --> 05:36:11.360 align:start position:0%
all the language that would induce the
 
05:36:13.590 --> 05:36:13.600 align:start position:0%
cost to the department
 
05:36:15.430 --> 05:36:15.440 align:start position:0%
and the cost to the schools should be
 
05:36:16.868 --> 05:36:16.878 align:start position:0%
rather negligible since they already
 
05:36:18.150 --> 05:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
have a form they're gathering and they
 
05:36:19.510 --> 05:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
just have to look at one other spot and
 
05:36:21.030 --> 05:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
see that something was checked and
 
05:36:23.270 --> 05:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
remind the parents if it wasn't
 
05:36:23.280 --> 05:36:24.070 align:start position:0%
remind the parents if it wasn't
um

05:36:24.070 --> 05:36:24.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:36:26.310 --> 05:36:26.320 align:start position:0%
so i'm not quite sure why we
 
05:36:28.548 --> 05:36:28.558 align:start position:0%
why you have an aversion to this bill
 
05:36:29.990 --> 05:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
and when we thought as a policy
 
05:36:31.990 --> 05:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
committee it was a good bill i know i'm
 
05:36:33.990 --> 05:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
here as a sub today but i'm still no
 
05:36:35.190 --> 05:36:35.200 align:start position:0%
you're doing great
 
05:36:37.910 --> 05:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
you you're welcome here anytime
 
05:36:39.510 --> 05:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
so so
 
05:36:41.910 --> 05:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
the reason i'm i'm picking at this is
 
05:36:44.070 --> 05:36:44.080 align:start position:0%
because i've had a lot of conversations
 
05:36:45.110 --> 05:36:45.120 align:start position:0%
with the
 
05:36:46.788 --> 05:36:46.798 align:start position:0%
my local principal
 
05:36:50.708 --> 05:36:50.718 align:start position:0%
and how upset she is at the legislature
 
05:36:54.310 --> 05:36:54.320 align:start position:0%
passing unfunded mandates and if we're
 
05:36:56.470 --> 05:36:56.480 align:start position:0%
trying to get the schools
 
05:36:58.070 --> 05:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
if we're trying if ultimately if we're
 
05:36:59.830 --> 05:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
trying to get the parents
 
05:37:02.708 --> 05:37:02.718 align:start position:0%
to do the lead testing like they should
 
05:37:04.230 --> 05:37:04.240 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
05:37:05.830 --> 05:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
in fact we're trying to give them
 
05:37:07.910 --> 05:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
incentives or to compel them to behave
 
05:37:09.670 --> 05:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
the way we want them to
 
05:37:12.230 --> 05:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
we're basically going to be asking the
 
05:37:14.230 --> 05:37:14.240 align:start position:0%
schools and the day care centers to be
 
05:37:16.628 --> 05:37:16.638 align:start position:0%
agents of the state to help us enforce
 
05:37:19.110 --> 05:37:19.120 align:start position:0%
that so we are putting a mandate
 
05:37:21.830 --> 05:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
on the school systems that
 
05:37:24.150 --> 05:37:24.160 align:start position:0%
for them to do additional work
 
05:37:26.390 --> 05:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
to me that's an unfunded mandate and
 
05:37:29.350 --> 05:37:29.360 align:start position:0%
because that's a financial issue i i see
 
05:37:33.270 --> 05:37:33.280 align:start position:0%
the whole bill is as being open to
 
05:37:34.788 --> 05:37:34.798 align:start position:0%
this so
 
05:37:38.788 --> 05:37:38.798 align:start position:0%
so that's that's why i'm pushing on it
 
05:37:40.390 --> 05:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
and i think we just have a difference of
 
05:37:42.230 --> 05:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
opinion representative
 
05:37:44.470 --> 05:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
uh representative erf
 
05:37:46.070 --> 05:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair first i just want
 
05:37:48.150 --> 05:37:48.160 align:start position:0%
to reiterate so i understand that the
 
05:37:49.830 --> 05:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
lead requirement for lead testing is
 
05:37:52.708 --> 05:37:52.718 align:start position:0%
already in statute sure okay
 
05:37:55.110 --> 05:37:55.120 align:start position:0%
so that's not what we're trying to
 
05:37:55.120 --> 05:37:56.548 align:start position:0%
so that's not what we're trying to
increase

05:37:56.548 --> 05:37:56.558 align:start position:0%
increase
 
05:37:58.628 --> 05:37:58.638 align:start position:0%
it's very likely based on what you've
 
05:38:00.548 --> 05:38:00.558 align:start position:0%
all said today
 
05:38:01.990 --> 05:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
that our
 
05:38:05.430 --> 05:38:05.440 align:start position:0%
testing is much higher than 40
 
05:38:07.430 --> 05:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
because all you're saying is this box
 
05:38:09.670 --> 05:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
hasn't been checked
 
05:38:11.350 --> 05:38:11.360 align:start position:0%
it's very possible that the testing has
 
05:38:12.708 --> 05:38:12.718 align:start position:0%
gone on but the
 
05:38:14.708 --> 05:38:14.718 align:start position:0%
schools aren't checking it and that's
 
05:38:16.788 --> 05:38:16.798 align:start position:0%
why i keep asking the question about
 
05:38:18.948 --> 05:38:18.958 align:start position:0%
it's tracked in a different way
 
05:38:22.310 --> 05:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
ms drone should answer that question
 
05:38:23.910 --> 05:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
the division of public health healthy
 
05:38:25.510 --> 05:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
homes and lead poisoning prevention
 
05:38:25.520 --> 05:38:26.548 align:start position:0%
homes and lead poisoning prevention
program

05:38:26.548 --> 05:38:26.558 align:start position:0%
program
 
05:38:28.390 --> 05:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
is this responsible for blood lead
 
05:38:30.948 --> 05:38:30.958 align:start position:0%
surveillance for the entire state ages
 
05:38:33.190 --> 05:38:33.200 align:start position:0%
zero through death so all blood lead
 
05:38:35.270 --> 05:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
tests for all children and adults come
 
05:38:37.190 --> 05:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
into our come into the division of
 
05:38:39.910 --> 05:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
public health where our epidemiologists
 
05:38:41.910 --> 05:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
and statisticians calculate the blood
 
05:38:45.190 --> 05:38:45.200 align:start position:0%
lead testing rates so the 2020
 
05:38:47.350 --> 05:38:47.360 align:start position:0%
blood lead data was just released and
 
05:38:49.590 --> 05:38:49.600 align:start position:0%
this is pre pandemic so this is when
 
05:38:50.548 --> 05:38:50.558 align:start position:0%
things were
 
05:38:53.830 --> 05:38:53.840 align:start position:0%
doing much better we tested 63 percent
 
05:38:56.070 --> 05:38:56.080 align:start position:0%
of all the one-year-olds in the state
 
05:38:58.788 --> 05:38:58.798 align:start position:0%
and 53 percent of all the two-year-olds
 
05:39:01.510 --> 05:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
in the state so we the vision public
 
05:39:01.520 --> 05:39:02.470 align:start position:0%
in the state so we the vision public
health

05:39:02.470 --> 05:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
health
 
05:39:05.190 --> 05:39:05.200 align:start position:0%
does have our hand on our pulse our hand
 
05:39:06.628 --> 05:39:06.638 align:start position:0%
on the pulse of the children who are
 
05:39:09.350 --> 05:39:09.360 align:start position:0%
tested it's it's reported directly from
 
05:39:11.190 --> 05:39:11.200 align:start position:0%
the healthcare providers in the
 
05:39:13.590 --> 05:39:13.600 align:start position:0%
commercial labs the lab cores the quests
 
05:39:17.670 --> 05:39:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:19.670 --> 05:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
so the bottom line is that the statute
 
05:39:21.350 --> 05:39:21.360 align:start position:0%
requiring the lead testing is that's
 
05:39:26.150 --> 05:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:28.868 --> 05:39:28.878 align:start position:0%
the statute is in place to require all
 
05:39:30.628 --> 05:39:30.638 align:start position:0%
one and two-year-olds to be tested in
 
05:39:32.788 --> 05:39:32.798 align:start position:0%
the state it's just a matter of
 
05:39:35.350 --> 05:39:35.360 align:start position:0%
making sure that that's happening
 
05:39:37.190 --> 05:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
throughout the state at the provider
 
05:39:37.200 --> 05:39:39.750 align:start position:0%
throughout the state at the provider
offices

05:39:39.750 --> 05:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
offices
 
05:39:41.990 --> 05:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
but she just told us that you have the
 
05:39:44.548 --> 05:39:44.558 align:start position:0%
data that tells you that you know
 
05:39:46.628 --> 05:39:46.638 align:start position:0%
only six to three percent of some age
 
05:39:49.510 --> 05:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
group was tested that says to me 37
 
05:39:49.520 --> 05:39:50.628 align:start position:0%
group was tested that says to me 37
percent

05:39:50.628 --> 05:39:50.638 align:start position:0%
percent
 
05:39:51.910 --> 05:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
weren't tested
 
05:39:53.350 --> 05:39:53.360 align:start position:0%
which means the statute requiring the
 
05:39:55.430 --> 05:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
testing is not working is that not
 
05:39:55.440 --> 05:39:56.548 align:start position:0%
testing is not working is that not
accurate

05:39:56.548 --> 05:39:56.558 align:start position:0%
accurate
 
05:39:59.670 --> 05:39:59.680 align:start position:0%
i i think um what i i would just add to
 
05:40:01.510 --> 05:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
that is we have a lot of families here
 
05:40:03.430 --> 05:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire who who do
 
05:40:05.670 --> 05:40:05.680 align:start position:0%
not have a medical home they do not have
 
05:40:06.948 --> 05:40:06.958 align:start position:0%
a doctor
 
05:40:09.190 --> 05:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
so these families might get their blood
 
05:40:10.628 --> 05:40:10.638 align:start position:0%
testing at the wic clinic when they're
 
05:40:12.868 --> 05:40:12.878 align:start position:0%
getting their their food products or
 
05:40:14.548 --> 05:40:14.558 align:start position:0%
they might not get testing at all they
 
05:40:22.390 --> 05:40:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:23.830 --> 05:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
i think you're doing very good the
 
05:40:25.910 --> 05:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
sounds adversarial we're really just
 
05:40:28.868 --> 05:40:28.878 align:start position:0%
trying to dig in and understand okay so
 
05:40:31.830 --> 05:40:31.840 align:start position:0%
socrates even did this sort of thing so
 
05:40:31.840 --> 05:40:32.708 align:start position:0%
socrates even did this sort of thing so
uh

05:40:32.708 --> 05:40:32.718 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:40:34.390 --> 05:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
uh representative kenner but
 
05:40:35.670 --> 05:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
representative was sort of right there
 
05:40:37.190 --> 05:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
in a sense it isn't working the way we
 
05:40:39.270 --> 05:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
want it to we'd like to have you know
 
05:40:40.868 --> 05:40:40.878 align:start position:0%
closer to 100
 
05:40:42.390 --> 05:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
that's what the goal of this bill was is
 
05:40:45.110 --> 05:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
to another point of contact where people
 
05:40:47.670 --> 05:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
you know we're where we can actually
 
05:40:50.230 --> 05:40:50.240 align:start position:0%
have a contact with a parent uh to
 
05:40:52.070 --> 05:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
remind them that it's important that the
 
05:40:53.910 --> 05:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
goal of this was simply to improve that
 
05:40:55.510 --> 05:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
compliance because it is not working as
 
05:40:57.430 --> 05:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
well as we would like it again the
 
05:41:00.070 --> 05:41:00.080 align:start position:0%
original part of the bill had reporting
 
05:41:02.708 --> 05:41:02.718 align:start position:0%
by individual providers with all kinds
 
05:41:05.190 --> 05:41:05.200 align:start position:0%
of data that was what actually induced
 
05:41:07.430 --> 05:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
the or caused the fiscal impact to the
 
05:41:09.270 --> 05:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
state and that's what we amended out
 
05:41:10.788 --> 05:41:10.798 align:start position:0%
because there was no appropriation we
 
05:41:12.230 --> 05:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
knew that there was no way that that was
 
05:41:13.910 --> 05:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
going to be able to pass
 
05:41:15.990 --> 05:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
so all of that which
 
05:41:17.750 --> 05:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
would have been a perhaps a cleaner way
 
05:41:19.110 --> 05:41:19.120 align:start position:0%
to try to track it and find out which
 
05:41:21.510 --> 05:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
providers are doing the testing and not
 
05:41:23.030 --> 05:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
it was just
 
05:41:25.590 --> 05:41:25.600 align:start position:0%
not not reasonable to consider without
 
05:41:26.948 --> 05:41:26.958 align:start position:0%
an appropriation and we knew that was
 
05:41:29.270 --> 05:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
not forthcoming so we amended that out
 
05:41:32.708 --> 05:41:32.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:33.750 --> 05:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:41:35.270 --> 05:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
have all the
 
05:41:39.270 --> 05:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
committee members ask their questions
 
05:41:41.350 --> 05:41:41.360 align:start position:0%
department have you told us everything
 
05:41:45.670 --> 05:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:46.708 --> 05:41:46.718 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:41:48.150 --> 05:41:48.160 align:start position:0%
so um
 
05:41:51.430 --> 05:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
we will not be voting on 1642 today uh
 
05:41:54.230 --> 05:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
representative representative ripple
 
05:41:57.350 --> 05:41:57.360 align:start position:0%
uh dr ripple i should say uh
 
05:42:00.788 --> 05:42:00.798 align:start position:0%
no miss mr ripple uh would you work on
 
05:42:03.110 --> 05:42:03.120 align:start position:0%
an amendment to we'll call it the walnut
 
05:42:05.270 --> 05:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
amendment to stick
 
05:42:07.990 --> 05:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
stick the um claws in there that this is
 
05:42:10.310 --> 05:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
not to be used punitively to deny
 
05:42:13.590 --> 05:42:13.600 align:start position:0%
enrollment or continuation of
 
05:42:15.430 --> 05:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
their position in the school or the day
 
05:42:16.628 --> 05:42:16.638 align:start position:0%
care center
 
05:42:18.230 --> 05:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
sure and that was my only question is
 
05:42:19.910 --> 05:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
whether you wanted it to apply only to
 
05:42:21.990 --> 05:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
section two child day care centers or to
 
05:42:24.948 --> 05:42:24.958 align:start position:0%
public schools in section one as well
 
05:42:29.350 --> 05:42:29.360 align:start position:0%
i i would i would do both um now uh on
 
05:42:31.750 --> 05:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
the day care center side of it we're
 
05:42:33.430 --> 05:42:33.440 align:start position:0%
kind of getting up into the private
 
05:42:33.440 --> 05:42:34.788 align:start position:0%
kind of getting up into the private
businesses

05:42:34.788 --> 05:42:34.798 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
05:42:37.190 --> 05:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
but we're saying that this is a reason
 
05:42:38.708 --> 05:42:38.718 align:start position:0%
not to deny
 
05:42:38.718 --> 05:42:39.510 align:start position:0%
not to deny
them

05:42:39.510 --> 05:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
them
 
05:42:43.350 --> 05:42:43.360 align:start position:0%
in enrollment which i think is is fair
 
05:42:43.360 --> 05:42:44.390 align:start position:0%
in enrollment which i think is is fair
um

05:42:44.390 --> 05:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:42:46.788 --> 05:42:46.798 align:start position:0%
because lead poisoning is not contagious
 
05:42:49.430 --> 05:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
to the best of my non-medical knowledge
 
05:42:51.750 --> 05:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
so and i agree with doing both sir thank
 
05:42:51.760 --> 05:42:53.510 align:start position:0%
so and i agree with doing both sir thank
you

05:42:53.510 --> 05:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:42:54.708 --> 05:42:54.718 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:42:57.830 --> 05:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
okay so with that 1642
 
05:43:00.390 --> 05:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
uh is recessed until monday to consider
 
05:43:16.548 --> 05:43:16.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:19.670 --> 05:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
i'm going to open this now on uh house
 
05:43:23.270 --> 05:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
bill 1526 relative to income eligibility
 
05:43:25.830 --> 05:43:25.840 align:start position:0%
for in and out medical assistance and
 
05:43:28.150 --> 05:43:28.160 align:start position:0%
i'll invite both representative snow and
 
05:43:31.750 --> 05:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
mr lipman up uh because i think we
 
05:43:33.350 --> 05:43:33.360 align:start position:0%
already see we've got
 
05:43:35.830 --> 05:43:35.840 align:start position:0%
two sides to this or at least two big
 
05:43:44.628 --> 05:43:44.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:46.230 --> 05:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
and then representative snow would if
 
05:43:48.470 --> 05:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
you'd lead us off on what you'd like us
 
05:44:02.070 --> 05:44:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:02.080 --> 05:44:03.430 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

05:44:03.430 --> 05:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:44:04.788 --> 05:44:04.798 align:start position:0%
on the surface this bill seems
 
05:44:06.390 --> 05:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
relatively simple
 
05:44:08.868 --> 05:44:08.878 align:start position:0%
house bill 1639
 
05:44:10.548 --> 05:44:10.558 align:start position:0%
which was passed in the last session of
 
05:44:13.030 --> 05:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
the legislature asked the department of
 
05:44:15.030 --> 05:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
health and human services to take a look
 
05:44:15.040 --> 05:44:15.830 align:start position:0%
health and human services to take a look
at

05:44:15.830 --> 05:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
at
 
05:44:18.070 --> 05:44:18.080 align:start position:0%
the minimum qualifying income for
 
05:44:20.708 --> 05:44:20.718 align:start position:0%
medicaid in and out which they did
 
05:44:23.030 --> 05:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
and that bill was submitted with some
 
05:44:25.590 --> 05:44:25.600 align:start position:0%
recommendations about how to move ahead
 
05:44:25.600 --> 05:44:26.390 align:start position:0%
recommendations about how to move ahead
and

05:44:26.390 --> 05:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:44:28.390 --> 05:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
there was
 
05:44:30.470 --> 05:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
recommendations about how to be funded
 
05:44:31.350 --> 05:44:31.360 align:start position:0%
through the
 
05:44:31.360 --> 05:44:32.470 align:start position:0%
through the
department

05:44:32.470 --> 05:44:32.480 align:start position:0%
department
 
05:44:34.868 --> 05:44:34.878 align:start position:0%
this this committee was concerned about
 
05:44:36.470 --> 05:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
some of the implications of other
 
05:44:38.868 --> 05:44:38.878 align:start position:0%
financial issues that were going on
 
05:44:40.470 --> 05:44:40.480 align:start position:0%
and felt that it was necessary to
 
05:44:40.480 --> 05:44:41.830 align:start position:0%
and felt that it was necessary to
suspend

05:44:41.830 --> 05:44:41.840 align:start position:0%
suspend
 
05:44:44.390 --> 05:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
new funding for that program
 
05:44:46.948 --> 05:44:46.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:47.990 --> 05:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
for this
 
05:44:48.000 --> 05:44:48.948 align:start position:0%
for this
tr

05:44:48.948 --> 05:44:48.958 align:start position:0%
tr
 
05:44:51.670 --> 05:44:51.680 align:start position:0%
by biennium
 
05:44:54.548 --> 05:44:54.558 align:start position:0%
and this bill is simply a request that
 
05:44:57.190 --> 05:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
if this situation is stabilized at all
 
05:44:59.110 --> 05:44:59.120 align:start position:0%
we would like to request
 
05:45:01.990 --> 05:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
that that suspension of the funding for
 
05:45:05.030 --> 05:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
this program be lifted so it could be
 
05:45:07.830 --> 05:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
funded beginning july 1st of this year
 
05:45:09.990 --> 05:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
for the second year of the biennium and
 
05:45:11.910 --> 05:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
thereafter i think it's a very important
 
05:45:11.920 --> 05:45:12.868 align:start position:0%
thereafter i think it's a very important
bill

05:45:12.868 --> 05:45:12.878 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:45:15.990 --> 05:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
we have fallen somewhat behind
 
05:45:18.628 --> 05:45:18.638 align:start position:0%
in bringing it up to date and
 
05:45:21.110 --> 05:45:21.120 align:start position:0%
hopefully we can move ahead and make it
 
05:45:23.510 --> 05:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
more effective both for clients
 
05:45:25.270 --> 05:45:25.280 align:start position:0%
and for a lot of the providers in the
 
05:45:27.830 --> 05:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
state and i think i'll leave it at that
 
05:45:27.840 --> 05:45:28.788 align:start position:0%
state and i think i'll leave it at that
because

05:45:28.788 --> 05:45:28.798 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:45:30.150 --> 05:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
there's any questions if you want
 
05:45:32.868 --> 05:45:32.878 align:start position:0%
details i i have two questions for you
 
05:45:34.390 --> 05:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
representatives now
 
05:45:34.400 --> 05:45:35.270 align:start position:0%
representatives now
one

05:45:35.270 --> 05:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
one
 
05:45:37.750 --> 05:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
when we caucused on this the republicans
 
05:45:39.830 --> 05:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
um we should have brought the democrats
 
05:45:42.310 --> 05:45:42.320 align:start position:0%
in to make us smarter but um we didn't
 
05:45:45.910 --> 05:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
uh would you none of us could remember
 
05:45:48.548 --> 05:45:48.558 align:start position:0%
how these payments got suspended in the
 
05:45:50.788 --> 05:45:50.798 align:start position:0%
first place and our theory
 
05:45:53.750 --> 05:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
was that the suspension of payments
 
05:45:56.788 --> 05:45:56.798 align:start position:0%
was initiated by the other uh
 
05:45:56.798 --> 05:45:57.990 align:start position:0%
was initiated by the other uh
chamber

05:45:57.990 --> 05:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
chamber
 
05:45:59.830 --> 05:45:59.840 align:start position:0%
do you do you know the politics of this
 
05:46:02.868 --> 05:46:02.878 align:start position:0%
of who did this no i don't i just know
 
05:46:04.708 --> 05:46:04.718 align:start position:0%
that we assumed that it was going to be
 
05:46:04.718 --> 05:46:05.830 align:start position:0%
that we assumed that it was going to be
funded

05:46:05.830 --> 05:46:05.840 align:start position:0%
funded
 
05:46:07.990 --> 05:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
and all we heard was that the finance
 
05:46:09.430 --> 05:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
committee felt
 
05:46:11.590 --> 05:46:11.600 align:start position:0%
uneasy about the availability of the
 
05:46:13.990 --> 05:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
funds and decided to suspend they didn't
 
05:46:15.510 --> 05:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
say whether it was the senate or the
 
05:46:17.910 --> 05:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
house i never got any feedback on that
 
05:46:17.920 --> 05:46:19.990 align:start position:0%
house i never got any feedback on that
whatsoever

05:46:19.990 --> 05:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
whatsoever
 
05:46:22.390 --> 05:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
represent or mr lipman did you it looked
 
05:46:24.070 --> 05:46:24.080 align:start position:0%
like you may have
 
05:46:25.910 --> 05:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
know something for the record henry
 
05:46:27.750 --> 05:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
littman medicaid director
 
05:46:29.590 --> 05:46:29.600 align:start position:0%
my recollection is the policy was
 
05:46:30.948 --> 05:46:30.958 align:start position:0%
approved and
 
05:46:33.750 --> 05:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
as representative snow and all we're
 
05:46:35.430 --> 05:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
talking about here is raising
 
05:46:38.628 --> 05:46:38.638 align:start position:0%
or making it easier for people to
 
05:46:40.868 --> 05:46:40.878 align:start position:0%
to qualify because the financial
 
05:46:43.110 --> 05:46:43.120 align:start position:0%
standards haven't been updated for a
 
05:46:46.310 --> 05:46:46.320 align:start position:0%
long long time and so that
 
05:46:48.868 --> 05:46:48.878 align:start position:0%
it was the fact that to
 
05:46:51.030 --> 05:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
change the standards
 
05:46:52.948 --> 05:46:52.958 align:start position:0%
would cause us to spend more money i
 
05:46:55.030 --> 05:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
think it was around 13 million for the
 
05:46:55.040 --> 05:46:55.750 align:start position:0%
think it was around 13 million for the
two

05:46:55.750 --> 05:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
two
 
05:46:57.670 --> 05:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
two years or 12 million for the two
 
05:46:59.910 --> 05:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
years that i think at the time there was
 
05:47:01.670 --> 05:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
uncertainty around the budget
 
05:47:06.548 --> 05:47:06.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:06.558 --> 05:47:07.590 align:start position:0%
 
remain

05:47:07.590 --> 05:47:07.600 align:start position:0%
remain
 
05:47:09.350 --> 05:47:09.360 align:start position:0%
it remained
 
05:47:11.030 --> 05:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
unfunded in this
 
05:47:13.350 --> 05:47:13.360 align:start position:0%
latest biennium
 
05:47:14.948 --> 05:47:14.958 align:start position:0%
and i apologize i didn't really
 
05:47:16.868 --> 05:47:16.878 align:start position:0%
introduce myself i'm
 
05:47:18.708 --> 05:47:18.718 align:start position:0%
i'm representative ken snow from
 
05:47:20.708 --> 05:47:20.718 align:start position:0%
manchester i represent ward 12 in
 
05:47:20.718 --> 05:47:21.910 align:start position:0%
manchester i represent ward 12 in
manchester

05:47:21.910 --> 05:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
manchester
 
05:47:24.230 --> 05:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
just historically i have
 
05:47:26.868 --> 05:47:26.878 align:start position:0%
uh 50 years of work in the community
 
05:47:29.830 --> 05:47:29.840 align:start position:0%
mental health movement across the and 48
 
05:47:30.708 --> 05:47:30.718 align:start position:0%
of those
 
05:47:32.548 --> 05:47:32.558 align:start position:0%
took place right here in new hampshire
 
05:47:34.070 --> 05:47:34.080 align:start position:0%
so i'm very familiar with some of the
 
05:47:37.590 --> 05:47:37.600 align:start position:0%
issues that goes on in that area and
 
05:47:40.070 --> 05:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
i think that this particular bill
 
05:47:42.708 --> 05:47:42.718 align:start position:0%
is much more important in the work that
 
05:47:44.548 --> 05:47:44.558 align:start position:0%
those community mental health agencies
 
05:47:46.788 --> 05:47:46.798 align:start position:0%
are doing than people really understand
 
05:47:47.910 --> 05:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
it's not a
 
05:47:49.990 --> 05:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
in and out medicaid is not a concept a
 
05:47:52.070 --> 05:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
lot of people really understand
 
05:47:54.470 --> 05:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
but it can be extremely important for
 
05:47:56.310 --> 05:47:56.320 align:start position:0%
some people that otherwise will have to
 
05:47:58.708 --> 05:47:58.718 align:start position:0%
go without services or
 
05:48:00.868 --> 05:48:00.878 align:start position:0%
be left outside of the system and i'd be
 
05:48:02.548 --> 05:48:02.558 align:start position:0%
glad to explain more but i don't want to
 
05:48:05.030 --> 05:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
take up a necessary time if you already
 
05:48:07.110 --> 05:48:07.120 align:start position:0%
know what the bill is all about
 
05:48:09.670 --> 05:48:09.680 align:start position:0%
representative weiler
 
05:48:12.390 --> 05:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
it's not clear to me when we say the uh
 
05:48:14.948 --> 05:48:14.958 align:start position:0%
program was suspended it was suspended
 
05:48:16.470 --> 05:48:16.480 align:start position:0%
at the higher
 
05:48:19.750 --> 05:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
income rate or we still had the program
 
05:48:22.628 --> 05:48:22.638 align:start position:0%
we had a book we had a program but the
 
05:48:25.510 --> 05:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
maximum allowable income or that
 
05:48:28.230 --> 05:48:28.240 align:start position:0%
threshold that allows people to be
 
05:48:31.270 --> 05:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
qualified or have to go through other
 
05:48:33.510 --> 05:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
steps to get qualified
 
05:48:35.510 --> 05:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
remain the same as it has for the last
 
05:48:39.030 --> 05:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
30 years 30 years okay thank you and and
 
05:48:41.110 --> 05:48:41.120 align:start position:0%
since we passed the budget inflation has
 
05:48:44.868 --> 05:48:44.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:47.030 --> 05:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh representative irf did you have
 
05:48:47.040 --> 05:48:49.190 align:start position:0%
uh representative irf did you have
something

05:48:49.190 --> 05:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
something
 
05:48:49.200 --> 05:48:49.910 align:start position:0%
something
if

05:48:49.910 --> 05:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
if
 
05:48:50.948 --> 05:48:50.958 align:start position:0%
if the committee wouldn't mind i
 
05:48:52.548 --> 05:48:52.558 align:start position:0%
wouldn't mind hearing his explanation of
 
05:48:53.830 --> 05:48:53.840 align:start position:0%
the program because i'd like to
 
05:48:55.190 --> 05:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
understand more about it but if nobody
 
05:48:57.590 --> 05:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
else wants to hear that then i i want to
 
05:48:59.910 --> 05:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
hear it this is uh this is i had never
 
05:49:02.230 --> 05:49:02.240 align:start position:0%
even heard of in and out except for the
 
05:49:04.150 --> 05:49:04.160 align:start position:0%
burgers in california
 
05:49:07.270 --> 05:49:07.280 align:start position:0%
until 48 hours ago so i'd i'd appreciate
 
05:49:09.030 --> 05:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
do you want me to explain it or want to
 
05:49:11.590 --> 05:49:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:13.750 --> 05:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
mr liverpool you always missed me why it
 
05:49:16.390 --> 05:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
was called in and out not out and in
 
05:49:16.400 --> 05:49:17.590 align:start position:0%
was called in and out not out and in
because

05:49:17.590 --> 05:49:17.600 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:49:19.350 --> 05:49:19.360 align:start position:0%
what happens here is people begin the
 
05:49:22.070 --> 05:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
month out of medicaid and if they meet
 
05:49:24.150 --> 05:49:24.160 align:start position:0%
certain standards they're then in but
 
05:49:25.750 --> 05:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
it's called in and out so we'll have to
 
05:49:27.030 --> 05:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
leave it with that
 
05:49:29.430 --> 05:49:29.440 align:start position:0%
but what this means is that
 
05:49:29.440 --> 05:49:30.628 align:start position:0%
but what this means is that
some

05:49:30.628 --> 05:49:30.638 align:start position:0%
some
 
05:49:35.030 --> 05:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
low-income uninsured individuals
 
05:49:37.430 --> 05:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
have an income that's slightly
 
05:49:39.990 --> 05:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
somewhat above the standard to qualify
 
05:49:43.590 --> 05:49:43.600 align:start position:0%
for them for regular medicaid
 
05:49:46.470 --> 05:49:46.480 align:start position:0%
this is simply a program and it is
 
05:49:48.788 --> 05:49:48.798 align:start position:0%
exists in most states across the country
 
05:49:50.548 --> 05:49:50.558 align:start position:0%
it's a program that's
 
05:49:52.390 --> 05:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
part of the center for medicaid and
 
05:49:54.628 --> 05:49:54.638 align:start position:0%
medicare service medicare and medicaid
 
05:49:54.638 --> 05:49:55.750 align:start position:0%
medicare service medicare and medicaid
services

05:49:55.750 --> 05:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
services
 
05:49:57.430 --> 05:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
and they have certain guidelines and
 
05:49:58.948 --> 05:49:58.958 align:start position:0%
recommendations about how it's to be
 
05:50:02.470 --> 05:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:04.150 --> 05:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
flexibility in terms of how the state
 
05:50:07.350 --> 05:50:07.360 align:start position:0%
applies it but basically what it says is
 
05:50:09.750 --> 05:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
that you set
 
05:50:11.750 --> 05:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
this threshold and if they're slightly
 
05:50:13.190 --> 05:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
above it
 
05:50:17.350 --> 05:50:17.360 align:start position:0%
that individual is allowed to document
 
05:50:21.830 --> 05:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
any legitimate medicaid eligible
 
05:50:24.548 --> 05:50:24.558 align:start position:0%
medical expense as long as they document
 
05:50:25.750 --> 05:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
that once
 
05:50:28.390 --> 05:50:28.400 align:start position:0%
that spend down brings them down to that
 
05:50:31.110 --> 05:50:31.120 align:start position:0%
threshold for the balance of the month
 
05:50:32.708 --> 05:50:32.718 align:start position:0%
they're qualified to have their other
 
05:50:37.990 --> 05:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:41.430 --> 05:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
so i see you nodding mr
 
05:50:44.070 --> 05:50:44.080 align:start position:0%
would you have anything to extend that i
 
05:50:45.270 --> 05:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
think the
 
05:50:47.910 --> 05:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
in terms of the the limits i think if
 
05:50:50.788 --> 05:50:50.798 align:start position:0%
i'm remembering right now don landry's
 
05:50:52.548 --> 05:50:52.558 align:start position:0%
policy person is in the back here she
 
05:50:53.750 --> 05:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
can correct me if i'm wrong but for
 
05:50:55.990 --> 05:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
example it allowed for your housing
 
05:50:59.030 --> 05:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
expenses to be 590 dollars a month and
 
05:51:01.910 --> 05:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
and we know if remember during testimony
 
05:51:05.030 --> 05:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
that you know you can't rent typically
 
05:51:05.040 --> 05:51:05.910 align:start position:0%
that you know you can't rent typically
um

05:51:05.910 --> 05:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:51:08.708 --> 05:51:08.718 align:start position:0%
at that level anymore so the the problem
 
05:51:10.868 --> 05:51:10.878 align:start position:0%
is people have
 
05:51:13.350 --> 05:51:13.360 align:start position:0%
expenses that are are not considered
 
05:51:15.350 --> 05:51:15.360 align:start position:0%
and um they don't
 
05:51:18.070 --> 05:51:18.080 align:start position:0%
remain on medicaid unless they
 
05:51:20.548 --> 05:51:20.558 align:start position:0%
incur medical expenses so i think what
 
05:51:23.030 --> 05:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
the idea here is that
 
05:51:24.868 --> 05:51:24.878 align:start position:0%
from the provider and the patient's
 
05:51:27.670 --> 05:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
standpoint is to consistently know
 
05:51:29.190 --> 05:51:29.200 align:start position:0%
that you're going to be
 
05:51:31.990 --> 05:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
covered by medicaid without having to
 
05:51:34.230 --> 05:51:34.240 align:start position:0%
go through a process of redocumenting
 
05:51:36.948 --> 05:51:36.958 align:start position:0%
every month that you've had
 
05:51:38.788 --> 05:51:38.798 align:start position:0%
you're poor enough if you will and
 
05:51:41.030 --> 05:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
you've had expenses large enough to to
 
05:51:43.750 --> 05:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
go on the program
 
05:51:43.760 --> 05:51:45.830 align:start position:0%
go on the program
representative

05:51:45.830 --> 05:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:51:47.750 --> 05:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
so just so understand that makes perfect
 
05:51:49.750 --> 05:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
sense and thank you for that so
 
05:51:49.760 --> 05:51:51.030 align:start position:0%
sense and thank you for that so
the

05:51:51.030 --> 05:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:51:53.030 --> 05:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
the the uh he spends some money gets
 
05:51:54.150 --> 05:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
down to that income limit now that
 
05:51:56.150 --> 05:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
medicaid picks it up when the next month
 
05:51:58.548 --> 05:51:58.558 align:start position:0%
begins does he then still have to spend
 
05:52:00.548 --> 05:52:00.558 align:start position:0%
down to that whatever that level is so
 
05:52:02.628 --> 05:52:02.638 align:start position:0%
it's an ongoing process if you're right
 
05:52:03.830 --> 05:52:03.840 align:start position:0%
across the
 
05:52:05.830 --> 05:52:05.840 align:start position:0%
threshold yes yes
 
05:52:08.070 --> 05:52:08.080 align:start position:0%
and i think we estimated around a
 
05:52:09.910 --> 05:52:09.920 align:start position:0%
thousand individuals are
 
05:52:11.270 --> 05:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
on this
 
05:52:12.868 --> 05:52:12.878 align:start position:0%
threshold thank you very much for the
 
05:52:14.708 --> 05:52:14.718 align:start position:0%
explanation i really appreciate it
 
05:52:16.470 --> 05:52:16.480 align:start position:0%
so so these are people that are on
 
05:52:19.350 --> 05:52:19.360 align:start position:0%
ongoing care programs yes yes and when
 
05:52:21.510 --> 05:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
you say really only applies to people
 
05:52:24.070 --> 05:52:24.080 align:start position:0%
low-income people who are uninsured who
 
05:52:26.230 --> 05:52:26.240 align:start position:0%
have ongoing and pretty overwhelming
 
05:52:27.990 --> 05:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
medical expenses that it would be
 
05:52:29.670 --> 05:52:29.680 align:start position:0%
impossible to meet
 
05:52:29.680 --> 05:52:30.548 align:start position:0%
impossible to meet
with

05:52:30.548 --> 05:52:30.558 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:52:31.830 --> 05:52:31.840 align:start position:0%
whatever income they would have
 
05:52:33.750 --> 05:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
available to them in any way that's
 
05:52:36.708 --> 05:52:36.718 align:start position:0%
that's really what it is and speaking
 
05:52:38.548 --> 05:52:38.558 align:start position:0%
from a community mental health standard
 
05:52:40.628 --> 05:52:40.638 align:start position:0%
many of the people that we dealt with
 
05:52:42.548 --> 05:52:42.558 align:start position:0%
over the years are people that
 
05:52:45.590 --> 05:52:45.600 align:start position:0%
are certified as having a severe and
 
05:52:47.830 --> 05:52:47.840 align:start position:0%
persistent mental illness which means
 
05:52:50.310 --> 05:52:50.320 align:start position:0%
they need ongoing care over a longer
 
05:52:52.868 --> 05:52:52.878 align:start position:0%
period of time both in terms of services
 
05:52:55.350 --> 05:52:55.360 align:start position:0%
and maintaining of medications and other
 
05:52:57.590 --> 05:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
things to keep them on an even keel and
 
05:52:59.190 --> 05:52:59.200 align:start position:0%
so they can function comfortably in the
 
05:53:01.030 --> 05:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
community and
 
05:53:03.030 --> 05:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
this is very valuable to them because
 
05:53:04.628 --> 05:53:04.638 align:start position:0%
some of them do have income that puts
 
05:53:06.310 --> 05:53:06.320 align:start position:0%
them slightly above
 
05:53:06.320 --> 05:53:07.030 align:start position:0%
them slightly above
that

05:53:07.030 --> 05:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:53:09.830 --> 05:53:09.840 align:start position:0%
minimum threshold that gets them in but
 
05:53:12.230 --> 05:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
this allows them to continue i will have
 
05:53:13.430 --> 05:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
to say
 
05:53:13.440 --> 05:53:14.310 align:start position:0%
to say
that

05:53:14.310 --> 05:53:14.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:53:16.628 --> 05:53:16.638 align:start position:0%
the minimum income that's used here in
 
05:53:19.590 --> 05:53:19.600 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is among the lowest of
 
05:53:22.150 --> 05:53:22.160 align:start position:0%
anywhere in the country frankly
 
05:53:25.110 --> 05:53:25.120 align:start position:0%
the minimum income which is 30 years old
 
05:53:27.190 --> 05:53:27.200 align:start position:0%
back in the early 90s when this was
 
05:53:27.200 --> 05:53:28.390 align:start position:0%
back in the early 90s when this was
established

05:53:28.390 --> 05:53:28.400 align:start position:0%
established
 
05:53:31.430 --> 05:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
the the minimum income was set at
 
05:53:33.750 --> 05:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
dollars a month for a single individual
 
05:53:35.510 --> 05:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
now that's a little less than 150
 
05:53:38.470 --> 05:53:38.480 align:start position:0%
dollars a week to meet all your expenses
 
05:53:40.150 --> 05:53:40.160 align:start position:0%
and i would challenge anyone in this
 
05:53:41.590 --> 05:53:41.600 align:start position:0%
room to think they could meet all their
 
05:53:44.948 --> 05:53:44.958 align:start position:0%
expenses on 150 a week there was a time
 
05:53:46.470 --> 05:53:46.480 align:start position:0%
when you could easily do that but you
 
05:53:48.788 --> 05:53:48.798 align:start position:0%
can no longer do that and that's what we
 
05:53:50.948 --> 05:53:50.958 align:start position:0%
tried to do is to bring that standard up
 
05:53:50.958 --> 05:53:52.150 align:start position:0%
tried to do is to bring that standard up
and

05:53:52.150 --> 05:53:52.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:53:53.990 --> 05:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
thanks to mr lippman and the state they
 
05:53:57.030 --> 05:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
did do a very good job of getting a much
 
05:53:58.548 --> 05:53:58.558 align:start position:0%
better standard
 
05:54:00.548 --> 05:54:00.558 align:start position:0%
that accomplishes two very important
 
05:54:00.558 --> 05:54:01.670 align:start position:0%
that accomplishes two very important
things

05:54:01.670 --> 05:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
things
 
05:54:03.350 --> 05:54:03.360 align:start position:0%
one is it
 
05:54:05.430 --> 05:54:05.440 align:start position:0%
it means that the spend down they're
 
05:54:06.708 --> 05:54:06.718 align:start position:0%
going to have to
 
05:54:09.510 --> 05:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
pay each month becomes less in order to
 
05:54:11.430 --> 05:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
meet the standard because suddenly the
 
05:54:13.270 --> 05:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
threshold is raised to a higher amount
 
05:54:15.430 --> 05:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
so they only have to go to that level in
 
05:54:17.990 --> 05:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
order to qualify
 
05:54:21.430 --> 05:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
secondly at least the estimates by his
 
05:54:23.590 --> 05:54:23.600 align:start position:0%
office of the people for example that we
 
05:54:23.600 --> 05:54:24.788 align:start position:0%
office of the people for example that we
serve

05:54:24.788 --> 05:54:24.798 align:start position:0%
serve
 
05:54:26.150 --> 05:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
with severe and persistent mental
 
05:54:28.150 --> 05:54:28.160 align:start position:0%
illness for example
 
05:54:30.470 --> 05:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
one third or possibly more we don't know
 
05:54:30.480 --> 05:54:31.750 align:start position:0%
one third or possibly more we don't know
exactly

05:54:31.750 --> 05:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
05:54:34.548 --> 05:54:34.558 align:start position:0%
their new their income with this new
 
05:54:37.830 --> 05:54:37.840 align:start position:0%
threshold would be below that threshold
 
05:54:40.230 --> 05:54:40.240 align:start position:0%
so they would be shifted immediately out
 
05:54:42.390 --> 05:54:42.400 align:start position:0%
of the fee for service in and out
 
05:54:42.400 --> 05:54:43.430 align:start position:0%
of the fee for service in and out
program

05:54:43.430 --> 05:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
program
 
05:54:45.990 --> 05:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
into one of the managed care programs
 
05:54:49.430 --> 05:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
for regular medicaid which is much more
 
05:54:51.830 --> 05:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
efficient and cost effective way to
 
05:54:53.750 --> 05:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
administer it so that's a distinct
 
05:54:55.670 --> 05:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
advantage of doing that
 
05:54:57.350 --> 05:54:57.360 align:start position:0%
secondly i think that one of the
 
05:55:00.230 --> 05:55:00.240 align:start position:0%
problems is of the people that we serve
 
05:55:03.110 --> 05:55:03.120 align:start position:0%
especially with this lower income level
 
05:55:05.030 --> 05:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
this spend down
 
05:55:07.270 --> 05:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
they can't pay it it would be like
 
05:55:09.750 --> 05:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
getting blood from a stone
 
05:55:11.670 --> 05:55:11.680 align:start position:0%
the mental health centers
 
05:55:13.270 --> 05:55:13.280 align:start position:0%
each year
 
05:55:15.510 --> 05:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
generate bad debt in the amount of
 
05:55:17.430 --> 05:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
somewhere between seven and seven and a
 
05:55:19.350 --> 05:55:19.360 align:start position:0%
half million dollars
 
05:55:21.350 --> 05:55:21.360 align:start position:0%
and that's pretty substantial to try to
 
05:55:22.708 --> 05:55:22.718 align:start position:0%
work that in
 
05:55:24.868 --> 05:55:24.878 align:start position:0%
other facilities hospital emergency
 
05:55:27.430 --> 05:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
rooms run into the same situation when
 
05:55:29.590 --> 05:55:29.600 align:start position:0%
people come in prior to having met
 
05:55:29.600 --> 05:55:31.110 align:start position:0%
people come in prior to having met
that

05:55:31.110 --> 05:55:31.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:55:33.510 --> 05:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
that threshold requirement
 
05:55:35.750 --> 05:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
can't collect and the person just has no
 
05:55:38.868 --> 05:55:38.878 align:start position:0%
ability to meet that standard so
 
05:55:41.670 --> 05:55:41.680 align:start position:0%
the increase in the threshold is a very
 
05:55:43.830 --> 05:55:43.840 align:start position:0%
important step and that's why we're
 
05:55:46.150 --> 05:55:46.160 align:start position:0%
interested in in moving ahead with it
 
05:55:48.070 --> 05:55:48.080 align:start position:0%
and seeing if it won't overall improve
 
05:55:50.390 --> 05:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
the program and more importantly would
 
05:55:52.470 --> 05:55:52.480 align:start position:0%
reduce the amount of bad debt
 
05:55:53.830 --> 05:55:53.840 align:start position:0%
the community mental health centers and
 
05:55:55.990 --> 05:55:56.000 align:start position:0%
probably the hospitals have to endure
 
05:55:58.470 --> 05:55:58.480 align:start position:0%
you should know that this bad debt
 
05:56:01.030 --> 05:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
is one half state money
 
05:56:04.150 --> 05:56:04.160 align:start position:0%
in one half the federal match
 
05:56:05.350 --> 05:56:05.360 align:start position:0%
so the
 
05:56:06.868 --> 05:56:06.878 align:start position:0%
what happens with new hampshire even
 
05:56:09.510 --> 05:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
though that seems very high
 
05:56:11.190 --> 05:56:11.200 align:start position:0%
and it is high because it
 
05:56:12.230 --> 05:56:12.240 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:56:14.310 --> 05:56:14.320 align:start position:0%
it's money that we did not get
 
05:56:14.320 --> 05:56:15.110 align:start position:0%
it's money that we did not get
but

05:56:15.110 --> 05:56:15.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:56:15.120 --> 05:56:16.310 align:start position:0%
but
um

05:56:16.310 --> 05:56:16.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:56:18.390 --> 05:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
i think he made my point i i
 
05:56:20.948 --> 05:56:20.958 align:start position:0%
don't want to go
 
05:56:23.430 --> 05:56:23.440 align:start position:0%
representative for follow-up
 
05:56:25.830 --> 05:56:25.840 align:start position:0%
so you said the original amount was 591
 
05:56:27.430 --> 05:56:27.440 align:start position:0%
per month what what what is it now under
 
05:56:30.470 --> 05:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
the new 901
 
05:56:32.708 --> 05:56:32.718 align:start position:0%
representative conner yeah just the
 
05:56:34.390 --> 05:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
couple of things i passed out as we
 
05:56:37.510 --> 05:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
began i mentioned to rep edwards that we
 
05:56:40.070 --> 05:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
had these things handed out when we
 
05:56:42.150 --> 05:56:42.160 align:start position:0%
heard the bill and so i passed them
 
05:56:43.750 --> 05:56:43.760 align:start position:0%
around to you just to make it a little
 
05:56:46.070 --> 05:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
easier for you i think the easiest one
 
05:56:47.670 --> 05:56:47.680 align:start position:0%
to understand is if you look at the one
 
05:56:49.590 --> 05:56:49.600 align:start position:0%
from nami new hampshire
 
05:56:52.390 --> 05:56:52.400 align:start position:0%
champ paragraph two discusses how this
 
05:56:54.708 --> 05:56:54.718 align:start position:0%
in and out works you know in written if
 
05:56:57.030 --> 05:56:57.040 align:start position:0%
you kind of follow written issues better
 
05:56:58.390 --> 05:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
than oral
 
05:57:00.070 --> 05:57:00.080 align:start position:0%
and gives the number in the middle of
 
05:57:00.080 --> 05:57:01.030 align:start position:0%
and gives the number in the middle of
that

05:57:01.030 --> 05:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:57:04.150 --> 05:57:04.160 align:start position:0%
paragraph that 591 and in the third
 
05:57:05.830 --> 05:57:05.840 align:start position:0%
paragraph down toward the bottom it
 
05:57:07.110 --> 05:57:07.120 align:start position:0%
talks about the new number for a
 
05:57:08.948 --> 05:57:08.958 align:start position:0%
household of one that the threshold in
 
05:57:11.110 --> 05:57:11.120 align:start position:0%
keys to 901
 
05:57:12.868 --> 05:57:12.878 align:start position:0%
the bottom line thing to impor to kind
 
05:57:15.190 --> 05:57:15.200 align:start position:0%
of understand about this is
 
05:57:17.190 --> 05:57:17.200 align:start position:0%
we're looking at really simply a cost of
 
05:57:17.200 --> 05:57:18.948 align:start position:0%
we're looking at really simply a cost of
living

05:57:18.948 --> 05:57:18.958 align:start position:0%
living
 
05:57:20.948 --> 05:57:20.958 align:start position:0%
adjustment if you will i looked up and
 
05:57:22.310 --> 05:57:22.320 align:start position:0%
googled if you have a hundred dollars
 
05:57:26.548 --> 05:57:26.558 align:start position:0%
back in 1992 what is that in 2002 2022
 
05:57:28.868 --> 05:57:28.878 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry and it's 202 dollars in other
 
05:57:30.470 --> 05:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
words twice as much
 
05:57:31.430 --> 05:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
we have
 
05:57:33.750 --> 05:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
this all this does is correct what the
 
05:57:36.628 --> 05:57:36.638 align:start position:0%
inflation has done to people
 
05:57:39.510 --> 05:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
since that time it was set at 591 it's
 
05:57:41.830 --> 05:57:41.840 align:start position:0%
not realistic to consider the numbers in
 
05:57:43.750 --> 05:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
1992 are the same as we're dealing with
 
05:57:43.760 --> 05:57:44.708 align:start position:0%
1992 are the same as we're dealing with
now

05:57:44.708 --> 05:57:44.718 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:57:46.470 --> 05:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
it doesn't even bring them up to make it
 
05:57:48.548 --> 05:57:48.558 align:start position:0%
as high a threshold as was designed in
 
05:57:48.558 --> 05:57:50.150 align:start position:0%
as high a threshold as was designed in
1992

05:57:50.150 --> 05:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
1992
 
05:57:51.590 --> 05:57:51.600 align:start position:0%
because if one did that it would
 
05:57:53.190 --> 05:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
actually be more on the order of about
 
05:57:53.200 --> 05:57:54.708 align:start position:0%
actually be more on the order of about
1200

05:57:54.708 --> 05:57:54.718 align:start position:0%
1200
 
05:57:56.788 --> 05:57:56.798 align:start position:0%
so it brings it up
 
05:57:58.470 --> 05:57:58.480 align:start position:0%
really closer to about
 
05:58:00.310 --> 05:58:00.320 align:start position:0%
two-thirds the way up
 
05:58:02.948 --> 05:58:02.958 align:start position:0%
to what inflation has done
 
05:58:04.948 --> 05:58:04.958 align:start position:0%
so i look at this as just simply an
 
05:58:07.030 --> 05:58:07.040 align:start position:0%
adjustment to make sure that it fits
 
05:58:07.040 --> 05:58:08.070 align:start position:0%
adjustment to make sure that it fits
well

05:58:08.070 --> 05:58:08.080 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:58:10.548 --> 05:58:10.558 align:start position:0%
with what's happened to the costs over
 
05:58:13.190 --> 05:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
that 30 years i also had a question for
 
05:58:16.868 --> 05:58:16.878 align:start position:0%
mr litman if i could ask that question
 
05:58:19.510 --> 05:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
because of the fact you have to document
 
05:58:22.628 --> 05:58:22.638 align:start position:0%
in and out on a monthly basis
 
05:58:24.310 --> 05:58:24.320 align:start position:0%
we keep talking about what the increased
 
05:58:26.230 --> 05:58:26.240 align:start position:0%
cost would be for you know putting
 
05:58:28.070 --> 05:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
getting people onto medicaid but what
 
05:58:30.788 --> 05:58:30.798 align:start position:0%
would be the decreased cost because of
 
05:58:30.798 --> 05:58:31.750 align:start position:0%
would be the decreased cost because of
the

05:58:31.750 --> 05:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:58:34.150 --> 05:58:34.160 align:start position:0%
no longer the need to document every
 
05:58:35.990 --> 05:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
month whether people are in or out and
 
05:58:37.350 --> 05:58:37.360 align:start position:0%
what time of the month and checking
 
05:58:38.948 --> 05:58:38.958 align:start position:0%
every single bill they got how much do
 
05:58:42.788 --> 05:58:42.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:44.470 --> 05:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
there is a cost associated with that
 
05:58:46.628 --> 05:58:46.638 align:start position:0%
representative canark i think that in
 
05:58:48.868 --> 05:58:48.878 align:start position:0%
terms of if you then reversed and said
 
05:58:50.788 --> 05:58:50.798 align:start position:0%
how many people could we cut as a result
 
05:58:52.390 --> 05:58:52.400 align:start position:0%
of changing that i don't think it would
 
05:58:53.910 --> 05:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
be because there are certain procedures
 
05:58:55.830 --> 05:58:55.840 align:start position:0%
that have to go on i think the burden is
 
05:58:55.840 --> 05:58:57.270 align:start position:0%
that have to go on i think the burden is
really

05:58:57.270 --> 05:58:57.280 align:start position:0%
really
 
05:58:59.430 --> 05:58:59.440 align:start position:0%
the cost of fuels absorbed by
 
05:59:01.510 --> 05:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
the beneficiaries who have to
 
05:59:01.520 --> 05:59:02.310 align:start position:0%
the beneficiaries who have to
to

05:59:02.310 --> 05:59:02.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:59:04.948 --> 05:59:04.958 align:start position:0%
document things and then by the the
 
05:59:06.548 --> 05:59:06.558 align:start position:0%
providers who end up
 
05:59:08.230 --> 05:59:08.240 align:start position:0%
you know having to either work with
 
05:59:10.230 --> 05:59:10.240 align:start position:0%
people or chase them and spend
 
05:59:12.390 --> 05:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
collection costs so i think that's where
 
05:59:16.390 --> 05:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
the costs with savings would be um occur
 
05:59:18.548 --> 05:59:18.558 align:start position:0%
that's not counted in what i said was
 
05:59:20.948 --> 05:59:20.958 align:start position:0%
bad debt but it is a significant amount
 
05:59:22.708 --> 05:59:22.718 align:start position:0%
of effort on the part of
 
05:59:24.708 --> 05:59:24.718 align:start position:0%
both the treatment staff and other
 
05:59:27.030 --> 05:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
management staff within the center to
 
05:59:29.110 --> 05:59:29.120 align:start position:0%
make sure that we stay right on top of
 
05:59:29.120 --> 05:59:29.990 align:start position:0%
make sure that we stay right on top of
what

05:59:29.990 --> 05:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
what
 
05:59:31.990 --> 05:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
each person's legitimate expenses have
 
05:59:34.868 --> 05:59:34.878 align:start position:0%
been so that we can implement the
 
05:59:38.310 --> 05:59:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:40.788 --> 05:59:40.798 align:start position:0%
representative weiler
 
05:59:43.030 --> 05:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
the confusion is
 
05:59:45.110 --> 05:59:45.120 align:start position:0%
the way the the bill is written it says
 
05:59:45.120 --> 05:59:47.430 align:start position:0%
the way the the bill is written it says
repeal

05:59:47.430 --> 05:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
repeal
 
05:59:48.948 --> 05:59:48.958 align:start position:0%
and it gives the numbers requiring the
 
05:59:50.390 --> 05:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
05:59:52.788 --> 05:59:52.798 align:start position:0%
to amend the income eligibility standard
 
05:59:54.390 --> 05:59:54.400 align:start position:0%
for the in and out medical assistance
 
05:59:56.548 --> 05:59:56.558 align:start position:0%
policy is repealed
 
05:59:56.558 --> 05:59:57.670 align:start position:0%
policy is repealed
so

05:59:57.670 --> 05:59:57.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:00:00.708 --> 06:00:00.718 align:start position:0%
is that the 591 that's repealed and
 
06:00:02.230 --> 06:00:02.240 align:start position:0%
and shouldn't we replace it with
 
06:00:04.230 --> 06:00:04.240 align:start position:0%
something or is it just leave it up to
 
06:00:04.240 --> 06:00:06.868 align:start position:0%
something or is it just leave it up to
the

06:00:06.868 --> 06:00:06.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:09.510 --> 06:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
i don't know what that mean i
 
06:00:11.990 --> 06:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
when i used repeal i was hoping we would
 
06:00:14.548 --> 06:00:14.558 align:start position:0%
repeal the suspension and move ahead
 
06:00:15.670 --> 06:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
with the
 
06:00:18.310 --> 06:00:18.320 align:start position:0%
activating the programs what i think it
 
06:00:20.390 --> 06:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
means but i don't know
 
06:00:21.990 --> 06:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
maybe awkwardly
 
06:00:23.030 --> 06:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
i didn't
 
06:00:25.270 --> 06:00:25.280 align:start position:0%
physically write the bill we may know an
 
06:00:28.628 --> 06:00:28.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:30.948 --> 06:00:30.958 align:start position:0%
i think the answer is that the policy
 
06:00:33.830 --> 06:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
was approved and voted into law that
 
06:00:35.990 --> 06:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
that repealing this particular thing
 
06:00:36.000 --> 06:00:37.110 align:start position:0%
that repealing this particular thing
would

06:00:37.110 --> 06:00:37.120 align:start position:0%
would
 
06:00:39.190 --> 06:00:39.200 align:start position:0%
put into law the policy that was
 
06:00:41.910 --> 06:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
approved in 19 is my understanding i
 
06:00:44.310 --> 06:00:44.320 align:start position:0%
don't know if if
 
06:00:46.788 --> 06:00:46.798 align:start position:0%
you can confirm that kevin
 
06:00:48.628 --> 06:00:48.638 align:start position:0%
yes i think that's right the policy was
 
06:00:50.948 --> 06:00:50.958 align:start position:0%
in place it was suspended in the trailer
 
06:00:53.430 --> 06:00:53.440 align:start position:0%
bill so by repealing that suspension it
 
06:00:56.470 --> 06:00:56.480 align:start position:0%
would put the policy back into effect
 
06:00:58.390 --> 06:00:58.400 align:start position:0%
do you know how it got into the trailer
 
06:00:58.400 --> 06:01:00.150 align:start position:0%
do you know how it got into the trailer
bill

06:01:00.150 --> 06:01:00.160 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:01:02.230 --> 06:01:02.240 align:start position:0%
i think the suspension was first added
 
06:01:05.270 --> 06:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:07.030 --> 06:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
the department i believe had requested
 
06:01:08.708 --> 06:01:08.718 align:start position:0%
that the senate either
 
06:01:11.510 --> 06:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
fund the policy at the 12 or 13 million
 
06:01:11.520 --> 06:01:12.230 align:start position:0%
fund the policy at the 12 or 13 million
or

06:01:12.230 --> 06:01:12.240 align:start position:0%
or
 
06:01:12.240 --> 06:01:13.270 align:start position:0%
or
suspend

06:01:13.270 --> 06:01:13.280 align:start position:0%
suspend
 
06:01:14.868 --> 06:01:14.878 align:start position:0%
uh rather than leave it in place with no
 
06:01:16.470 --> 06:01:16.480 align:start position:0%
funding and the senate opted to suspend
 
06:01:18.868 --> 06:01:18.878 align:start position:0%
it and that change was
 
06:01:22.070 --> 06:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
approved in committee of conference
 
06:01:23.910 --> 06:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
all right so uh
 
06:01:26.548 --> 06:01:26.558 align:start position:0%
okay representative walner
 
06:01:30.788 --> 06:01:30.798 align:start position:0%
um well so from what kevin just said
 
06:01:33.430 --> 06:01:33.440 align:start position:0%
it seems like the house position
 
06:01:35.510 --> 06:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
was to
 
06:01:39.110 --> 06:01:39.120 align:start position:0%
have this program in place is that
 
06:01:39.120 --> 06:01:42.230 align:start position:0%
have this program in place is that
correct

06:01:42.230 --> 06:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:44.150 --> 06:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
that was the house position there was no
 
06:01:45.910 --> 06:01:45.920 align:start position:0%
funding associated with the program in
 
06:01:48.310 --> 06:01:48.320 align:start position:0%
the house position though um
 
06:01:50.470 --> 06:01:50.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i don't recall if during
 
06:01:52.070 --> 06:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
the house phase the department came
 
06:01:53.910 --> 06:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
forward with language to suspend it or
 
06:01:53.920 --> 06:01:54.948 align:start position:0%
forward with language to suspend it or
not

06:01:54.948 --> 06:01:54.958 align:start position:0%
not
 
06:01:56.310 --> 06:01:56.320 align:start position:0%
so i don't want to speak to whether the
 
06:01:58.708 --> 06:01:58.718 align:start position:0%
house made a conscious decision to
 
06:02:00.548 --> 06:02:00.558 align:start position:0%
keep the program in place
 
06:02:02.470 --> 06:02:02.480 align:start position:0%
or not
 
06:02:04.548 --> 06:02:04.558 align:start position:0%
so it just strikes me that the
 
06:02:05.510 --> 06:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
at least
 
06:02:08.150 --> 06:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
the house side division three
 
06:02:11.910 --> 06:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
we we fully funded this portion of the
 
06:02:13.750 --> 06:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
governor's budget
 
06:02:13.760 --> 06:02:15.030 align:start position:0%
governor's budget
and

06:02:15.030 --> 06:02:15.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:02:18.150 --> 06:02:18.160 align:start position:0%
and and so i don't remember us ever
 
06:02:20.788 --> 06:02:20.798 align:start position:0%
having a discussion about
 
06:02:22.548 --> 06:02:22.558 align:start position:0%
not funding
 
06:02:24.868 --> 06:02:24.878 align:start position:0%
uh this line item because the line item
 
06:02:26.390 --> 06:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
would have been part of
 
06:02:28.548 --> 06:02:28.558 align:start position:0%
some other program and we were funding
 
06:02:30.548 --> 06:02:30.558 align:start position:0%
programs at the governor's budget level
 
06:02:32.310 --> 06:02:32.320 align:start position:0%
for the most part
 
06:02:34.548 --> 06:02:34.558 align:start position:0%
uh you did generally fund programs at
 
06:02:36.150 --> 06:02:36.160 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget level i would say
 
06:02:37.990 --> 06:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
in this area
 
06:02:40.310 --> 06:02:40.320 align:start position:0%
the governor did not fund this increase
 
06:02:42.150 --> 06:02:42.160 align:start position:0%
to 133 and a third percent and i think
 
06:02:43.510 --> 06:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
you would see that if you went back to
 
06:02:45.670 --> 06:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
the agency budget request
 
06:02:47.590 --> 06:02:47.600 align:start position:0%
they had a number associated with this
 
06:02:50.830 --> 06:02:50.840 align:start position:0%
the governor did not include that number
 
06:02:53.830 --> 06:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
um so the plot thickens it's the
 
06:02:56.860 --> 06:02:56.870 align:start position:0%
governor who didn't want to fund this
 
06:02:56.870 --> 06:02:58.868 align:start position:0%
governor who didn't want to fund this
[Laughter]

06:02:58.868 --> 06:02:58.878 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
06:03:00.310 --> 06:03:00.320 align:start position:0%
finally we got him
 
06:03:00.320 --> 06:03:02.788 align:start position:0%
finally we got him
[Laughter]

06:03:02.788 --> 06:03:02.798 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
06:03:04.310 --> 06:03:04.320 align:start position:0%
go ahead mr living you want to say
 
06:03:04.320 --> 06:03:06.070 align:start position:0%
go ahead mr living you want to say
something

06:03:06.070 --> 06:03:06.080 align:start position:0%
something
 
06:03:07.910 --> 06:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
one further recollection i have is that
 
06:03:09.750 --> 06:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
i think that was passed
 
06:03:12.150 --> 06:03:12.160 align:start position:0%
with a june 30th date with the
 
06:03:14.868 --> 06:03:14.878 align:start position:0%
anticipation that in the
 
06:03:14.878 --> 06:03:16.628 align:start position:0%
anticipation that in the
2223

06:03:16.628 --> 06:03:16.638 align:start position:0%
2223
 
06:03:18.788 --> 06:03:18.798 align:start position:0%
there'd be funding in it and then if you
 
06:03:21.350 --> 06:03:21.360 align:start position:0%
recall we kind of with what was going on
 
06:03:21.360 --> 06:03:22.470 align:start position:0%
recall we kind of with what was going on
with

06:03:22.470 --> 06:03:22.480 align:start position:0%
with
 
06:03:24.310 --> 06:03:24.320 align:start position:0%
state finances at one point thinking we
 
06:03:26.548 --> 06:03:26.558 align:start position:0%
were going to be at a 500 million dollar
 
06:03:28.868 --> 06:03:28.878 align:start position:0%
deficit that that it didn't
 
06:03:30.548 --> 06:03:30.558 align:start position:0%
didn't get funded and
 
06:03:30.558 --> 06:03:31.350 align:start position:0%
didn't get funded and
and

06:03:31.350 --> 06:03:31.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:03:32.708 --> 06:03:32.718 align:start position:0%
that's really i think what ended up
 
06:03:35.110 --> 06:03:35.120 align:start position:0%
happening is that the policy was agreed
 
06:03:36.230 --> 06:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
to and then
 
06:03:38.788 --> 06:03:38.798 align:start position:0%
expected it would get funded in the next
 
06:03:40.470 --> 06:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
session and it didn't
 
06:03:42.628 --> 06:03:42.638 align:start position:0%
for for reasons that
 
06:03:44.150 --> 06:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
you know in
 
06:03:45.430 --> 06:03:45.440 align:start position:0%
a certain time of year you would know
 
06:03:46.788 --> 06:03:46.798 align:start position:0%
and later on you would have a different
 
06:03:49.510 --> 06:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
perspective so let the record reflect
 
06:03:53.750 --> 06:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
that mr lipman defended the governor uh
 
06:03:56.390 --> 06:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
said he was making a decision in a
 
06:03:59.830 --> 06:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
period of pandemic confusion so okay so
 
06:04:01.510 --> 06:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
i got a totally different question for
 
06:04:04.470 --> 06:04:04.480 align:start position:0%
you i want to get to this other question
 
06:04:06.430 --> 06:04:06.440 align:start position:0%
of the
 
06:04:09.110 --> 06:04:09.120 align:start position:0%
6073 individuals that are in the in and
 
06:04:10.390 --> 06:04:10.400 align:start position:0%
out program
 
06:04:12.548 --> 06:04:12.558 align:start position:0%
how many of them fall into this category
 
06:04:14.470 --> 06:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
that i think representative snow
 
06:04:17.670 --> 06:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
described as severely mentally ill or
 
06:04:20.470 --> 06:04:20.480 align:start position:0%
what it was something like that about
 
06:04:22.070 --> 06:04:22.080 align:start position:0%
well i can tell you the last time we
 
06:04:24.150 --> 06:04:24.160 align:start position:0%
counted it exactly it was just under
 
06:04:27.350 --> 06:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
2500 about 24
 
06:04:29.270 --> 06:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
64. so
 
06:04:31.750 --> 06:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
it continues it's stabilized that around
 
06:04:34.150 --> 06:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
2500 people are in the in and out
 
06:04:36.470 --> 06:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
program who have that
 
06:04:40.230 --> 06:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
oh okay so so we're talking of the
 
06:04:42.470 --> 06:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
nearly 60 manchester
 
06:04:44.948 --> 06:04:44.958 align:start position:0%
now across the whole state
 
06:04:46.708 --> 06:04:46.718 align:start position:0%
i have those figures
 
06:04:48.310 --> 06:04:48.320 align:start position:0%
right here
 
06:04:50.868 --> 06:04:50.878 align:start position:0%
across the whole state
 
06:04:54.150 --> 06:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
no i'm sorry you're correct it's 2500
 
06:04:56.390 --> 06:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
for all 10 mental health centers our
 
06:04:57.590 --> 06:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
particular one
 
06:04:59.590 --> 06:04:59.600 align:start position:0%
with 365 but
 
06:05:01.910 --> 06:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
that's the number of people that benefit
 
06:05:04.230 --> 06:05:04.240 align:start position:0%
from this there are other people
 
06:05:06.230 --> 06:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
i'm just i'm sorry can we just stick to
 
06:05:08.470 --> 06:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
my regular medicaid i'm just i'm just
 
06:05:10.310 --> 06:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
asking questions and
 
06:05:13.110 --> 06:05:13.120 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to ask precise questions
 
06:05:14.230 --> 06:05:14.240 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
06:05:16.628 --> 06:05:16.638 align:start position:0%
so i think i think the answer
 
06:05:16.638 --> 06:05:17.510 align:start position:0%
so i think i think the answer
and

06:05:17.510 --> 06:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:05:19.110 --> 06:05:19.120 align:start position:0%
let's correct the record if it's not
 
06:05:22.470 --> 06:05:22.480 align:start position:0%
right but it's 2500 of the approximately
 
06:05:22.480 --> 06:05:24.548 align:start position:0%
right but it's 2500 of the approximately
6100

06:05:24.548 --> 06:05:24.558 align:start position:0%
6100
 
06:05:24.558 --> 06:05:25.350 align:start position:0%
6100
are

06:05:25.350 --> 06:05:25.360 align:start position:0%
are
 
06:05:28.150 --> 06:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
those with civil severe mental illness
 
06:05:30.390 --> 06:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
a diagnosis and keep in mind some of
 
06:05:33.830 --> 06:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
that 2500 also have co-occurring medical
 
06:05:33.840 --> 06:05:34.948 align:start position:0%
that 2500 also have co-occurring medical
problems

06:05:34.948 --> 06:05:34.958 align:start position:0%
problems
 
06:05:37.670 --> 06:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
that also add to the dilemma they have i
 
06:05:40.548 --> 06:05:40.558 align:start position:0%
mean older people can have diabetes
 
06:05:43.430 --> 06:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
so so where i'm going with this is mr
 
06:05:43.440 --> 06:05:44.708 align:start position:0%
so so where i'm going with this is mr
lipman

06:05:44.708 --> 06:05:44.718 align:start position:0%
lipman
 
06:05:46.230 --> 06:05:46.240 align:start position:0%
is there a way
 
06:05:49.270 --> 06:05:49.280 align:start position:0%
to do i'm concerned about maintaining
 
06:05:49.280 --> 06:05:50.310 align:start position:0%
to do i'm concerned about maintaining
the

06:05:50.310 --> 06:05:50.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:05:53.030 --> 06:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
vibrancy of our community health
 
06:05:55.350 --> 06:05:55.360 align:start position:0%
center infrastructure
 
06:05:59.190 --> 06:05:59.200 align:start position:0%
is there a way to carve this out so that
 
06:05:59.200 --> 06:05:59.990 align:start position:0%
is there a way to carve this out so that
we

06:05:59.990 --> 06:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
we
 
06:06:01.910 --> 06:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
you know much like we did with the
 
06:06:04.310 --> 06:06:04.320 align:start position:0%
adult dental benefit is there a way to
 
06:06:07.110 --> 06:06:07.120 align:start position:0%
carve this out so that we can authorize
 
06:06:08.628 --> 06:06:08.638 align:start position:0%
some money for
 
06:06:12.628 --> 06:06:12.638 align:start position:0%
uh the the the severely mentally ill
 
06:06:15.830 --> 06:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
the answer unfortunately i think is no
 
06:06:17.750 --> 06:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
with a butt um
 
06:06:17.760 --> 06:06:18.788 align:start position:0%
with a butt um
and

06:06:18.788 --> 06:06:18.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:06:20.470 --> 06:06:20.480 align:start position:0%
i asked
 
06:06:22.390 --> 06:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
anticipating that might be your question
 
06:06:24.708 --> 06:06:24.718 align:start position:0%
um i asked don landry to research a
 
06:06:27.830 --> 06:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
little bit new hampshire um in
 
06:06:30.310 --> 06:06:30.320 align:start position:0%
establishing disability and the like
 
06:06:33.430 --> 06:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
became what they call a 209 b state
 
06:06:34.628 --> 06:06:34.638 align:start position:0%
meaning that we could set our own
 
06:06:36.948 --> 06:06:36.958 align:start position:0%
criteria versus having to go on federal
 
06:06:38.628 --> 06:06:38.638 align:start position:0%
criteria and that goes
 
06:06:41.110 --> 06:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
way back to i don't know
 
06:06:44.070 --> 06:06:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:46.390 --> 06:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
1972 sorry
 
06:06:46.400 --> 06:06:47.670 align:start position:0%
1972 sorry
and

06:06:47.670 --> 06:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:06:49.190 --> 06:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
when you have that status you have
 
06:06:50.628 --> 06:06:50.638 align:start position:0%
certain flexibilities of setting your
 
06:06:53.190 --> 06:06:53.200 align:start position:0%
own state specific criteria but there's
 
06:06:54.470 --> 06:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
a condition with that with this
 
06:06:56.230 --> 06:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
particular program
 
06:06:58.628 --> 06:06:58.638 align:start position:0%
and i don't think you'll find trouble
 
06:07:00.948 --> 06:07:00.958 align:start position:0%
based on the venture discussion with who
 
06:07:03.510 --> 06:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
you do have to cover you have to cover
 
06:07:04.788 --> 06:07:04.798 align:start position:0%
the blind
 
06:07:08.310 --> 06:07:08.320 align:start position:0%
the disabled um
 
06:07:10.548 --> 06:07:10.558 align:start position:0%
who else am i missing nursing home
 
06:07:13.510 --> 06:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
aged people who are in and
 
06:07:13.520 --> 06:07:15.910 align:start position:0%
aged people who are in and
maybe

06:07:15.910 --> 06:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:18.310 --> 06:07:18.320 align:start position:0%
not in a nursing home but just aged old
 
06:07:20.150 --> 06:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
and poor if you will
 
06:07:21.670 --> 06:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
those are the ones you do have to cover
 
06:07:23.510 --> 06:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
so you could limit it to
 
06:07:25.670 --> 06:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
to a certain group of what might call
 
06:07:25.680 --> 06:07:27.030 align:start position:0%
to a certain group of what might call
fragile

06:07:27.030 --> 06:07:27.040 align:start position:0%
fragile
 
06:07:29.030 --> 06:07:29.040 align:start position:0%
individuals in the community
 
06:07:35.510 --> 06:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:38.310 --> 06:07:38.320 align:start position:0%
okay so for cover if uh 2500 are
 
06:07:40.868 --> 06:07:40.878 align:start position:0%
severely mentally ill that leaves about
 
06:07:44.948 --> 06:07:44.958 align:start position:0%
3 600 others development are those 3 600
 
06:07:47.150 --> 06:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
others are they big
 
06:07:50.230 --> 06:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries if we were to approve this
 
06:07:52.948 --> 06:07:52.958 align:start position:0%
in and out modification
 
06:07:55.430 --> 06:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
so we're we anticipated about another
 
06:07:57.910 --> 06:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
thousand individuals would come on to
 
06:08:00.948 --> 06:08:00.958 align:start position:0%
the program who are now going out
 
06:08:03.990 --> 06:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
on a monthly basis
 
06:08:05.910 --> 06:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
we it's hard to predict because you
 
06:08:07.830 --> 06:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
don't know how
 
06:08:11.190 --> 06:08:11.200 align:start position:0%
people's incomes are are changing
 
06:08:12.390 --> 06:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
but i would
 
06:08:15.430 --> 06:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
say that um the current composition
 
06:08:18.310 --> 06:08:18.320 align:start position:0%
probably is is as good a
 
06:08:20.070 --> 06:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
perspective of the number of people who
 
06:08:22.948 --> 06:08:22.958 align:start position:0%
would benefit or not so if
 
06:08:24.708 --> 06:08:24.718 align:start position:0%
40 percent of mental health i wouldn't
 
06:08:26.390 --> 06:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
couldn't come up with a better number
 
06:08:28.788 --> 06:08:28.798 align:start position:0%
for you unfortunately without having the
 
06:08:32.390 --> 06:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:33.670 --> 06:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
so i'm gonna
 
06:08:35.910 --> 06:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
assume what you just told me to my
 
06:08:39.190 --> 06:08:39.200 align:start position:0%
question is that they are also equally
 
06:08:40.868 --> 06:08:40.878 align:start position:0%
uh demanding
 
06:08:43.910 --> 06:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh customers for or beneficiaries of the
 
06:08:45.990 --> 06:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
in and out program that the the
 
06:08:47.990 --> 06:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
consumption rate between mentally ill
 
06:08:51.270 --> 06:08:51.280 align:start position:0%
and the others is it's the same
 
06:08:54.830 --> 06:08:54.840 align:start position:0%
it's the same consumption rate
 
06:08:57.910 --> 06:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
um if if we're talking about their
 
06:08:59.990 --> 06:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
monthly medical expenses
 
06:09:00.000 --> 06:09:00.788 align:start position:0%
monthly medical expenses
that

06:09:00.788 --> 06:09:00.798 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:09:03.430 --> 06:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
there is variability i think that i was
 
06:09:04.868 --> 06:09:04.878 align:start position:0%
talking about their
 
06:09:07.510 --> 06:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
income levels to be able to qualify for
 
06:09:09.350 --> 06:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
the program um
 
06:09:11.270 --> 06:09:11.280 align:start position:0%
i could i don't have it off the top of
 
06:09:12.868 --> 06:09:12.878 align:start position:0%
my head but there
 
06:09:12.878 --> 06:09:14.150 align:start position:0%
my head but there
um

06:09:14.150 --> 06:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:09:16.948 --> 06:09:16.958 align:start position:0%
we do have specific categories of what
 
06:09:19.430 --> 06:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
their managed care costs were and that's
 
06:09:22.070 --> 06:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
um i'm sure we took in developing that
 
06:09:24.150 --> 06:09:24.160 align:start position:0%
estimate that we took
 
06:09:27.350 --> 06:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
the current blend of
 
06:09:29.670 --> 06:09:29.680 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries to to come up with that
 
06:09:31.830 --> 06:09:31.840 align:start position:0%
estimate i don't it's been a while since
 
06:09:33.910 --> 06:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
we looked at that
 
06:09:36.390 --> 06:09:36.400 align:start position:0%
okay so it's impractical
 
06:09:38.310 --> 06:09:38.320 align:start position:0%
to do what i'm trying to do which is to
 
06:09:40.628 --> 06:09:40.638 align:start position:0%
find a way to do a carve out that
 
06:09:42.548 --> 06:09:42.558 align:start position:0%
addresses the greatest needs because
 
06:09:44.708 --> 06:09:44.718 align:start position:0%
they're all of equal needs and and we
 
06:09:49.270 --> 06:09:49.280 align:start position:0%
have the 209b or whatever that sort of
 
06:09:49.280 --> 06:09:50.390 align:start position:0%
have the 209b or whatever that sort of
would

06:09:50.390 --> 06:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
would
 
06:09:53.670 --> 06:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
rope us into doing all or nothing
 
06:09:55.830 --> 06:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
i mean it gives us flexibility elsewhere
 
06:09:57.750 --> 06:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
but in this particular instance it does
 
06:09:59.510 --> 06:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
require us to cover
 
06:10:02.150 --> 06:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
certain fragile groups that are disabled
 
06:10:03.190 --> 06:10:03.200 align:start position:0%
the blind
 
06:10:04.708 --> 06:10:04.718 align:start position:0%
representative weiler
 
06:10:06.390 --> 06:10:06.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
06:10:08.310 --> 06:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
mr lipman while we're
 
06:10:10.390 --> 06:10:10.400 align:start position:0%
slightly different subject but i know
 
06:10:12.230 --> 06:10:12.240 align:start position:0%
you track a lot of numbers
 
06:10:14.868 --> 06:10:14.878 align:start position:0%
so what we're talking about hhs and
 
06:10:17.830 --> 06:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
spending i'm curious have you any idea
 
06:10:21.510 --> 06:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
how much you're going to lapse
 
06:10:21.520 --> 06:10:23.350 align:start position:0%
how much you're going to lapse
um

06:10:23.350 --> 06:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:10:25.030 --> 06:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
i think i need to
 
06:10:26.868 --> 06:10:26.878 align:start position:0%
to consult with karen rounds to give you
 
06:10:29.350 --> 06:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
a number on that i think our concern
 
06:10:31.830 --> 06:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
honestly in terms of the medicaid budget
 
06:10:33.270 --> 06:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
at this point is
 
06:10:34.868 --> 06:10:34.878 align:start position:0%
you know just
 
06:10:37.750 --> 06:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
the beginning of this month
 
06:10:37.760 --> 06:10:38.470 align:start position:0%
the beginning of this month
the

06:10:38.470 --> 06:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:10:38.480 --> 06:10:39.430 align:start position:0%
the
feds

06:10:39.430 --> 06:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
feds
 
06:10:42.150 --> 06:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
issued what the unwind guidance is and
 
06:10:44.470 --> 06:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
so we've been getting enhanced fmap the
 
06:10:46.628 --> 06:10:46.638 align:start position:0%
extra 6.2 percent
 
06:10:48.070 --> 06:10:48.080 align:start position:0%
what's going to end up happening though
 
06:10:49.830 --> 06:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
is on the latest guidance saying that
 
06:10:50.948 --> 06:10:50.958 align:start position:0%
you could only
 
06:10:52.708 --> 06:10:52.718 align:start position:0%
disenroll up to
 
06:10:54.230 --> 06:10:54.240 align:start position:0%
those people who aren't eligible up to
 
06:10:57.430 --> 06:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
one-ninth of your enrollment which means
 
06:10:59.750 --> 06:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
we're gonna probably for example if it
 
06:10:59.760 --> 06:11:00.628 align:start position:0%
we're gonna probably for example if it
ends

06:11:00.628 --> 06:11:00.638 align:start position:0%
ends
 
06:11:02.628 --> 06:11:02.638 align:start position:0%
the middle of july we could start this
 
06:11:05.430 --> 06:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
enrollments beginning august 1st
 
06:11:07.510 --> 06:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
the enhanced death map is going to end
 
06:11:09.670 --> 06:11:09.680 align:start position:0%
in september 30th and then we're going
 
06:11:11.510 --> 06:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
to have a tale of a number of months
 
06:11:13.030 --> 06:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
where we're still going to be working to
 
06:11:15.110 --> 06:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
get the enrollment down
 
06:11:16.788 --> 06:11:16.798 align:start position:0%
and that's where
 
06:11:18.788 --> 06:11:18.798 align:start position:0%
i think we're concerned about the
 
06:11:21.430 --> 06:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
adequacy of what we have today it looks
 
06:11:23.270 --> 06:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
great but
 
06:11:24.868 --> 06:11:24.878 align:start position:0%
in terms of how long it actually takes
 
06:11:27.510 --> 06:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
to to bring the enrollment back to you
 
06:11:28.548 --> 06:11:28.558 align:start position:0%
know the pre
 
06:11:31.030 --> 06:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
pandemic level we we we think we're
 
06:11:32.628 --> 06:11:32.638 align:start position:0%
going to get there by
 
06:11:35.270 --> 06:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
you know april at least
 
06:11:36.470 --> 06:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
and that
 
06:11:38.708 --> 06:11:38.718 align:start position:0%
but we're concerned about whether there
 
06:11:40.628 --> 06:11:40.638 align:start position:0%
is a lapse in the medicaid spend itself
 
06:11:43.030 --> 06:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
because of that well there's still a lot
 
06:11:46.868 --> 06:11:46.878 align:start position:0%
of vacancies in employment right yes and
 
06:11:48.470 --> 06:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
that's what that's where i think i need
 
06:11:51.910 --> 06:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
karen to okay to opine let mr ripple
 
06:11:55.190 --> 06:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
know so he can inform us thank you sure
 
06:11:56.150 --> 06:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
06:11:58.548 --> 06:11:58.558 align:start position:0%
this is leaning towards us waiting until
 
06:12:01.110 --> 06:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
monday to take a vote anyways so we've
 
06:12:03.590 --> 06:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
got some time to get that data and i i
 
06:12:06.390 --> 06:12:06.400 align:start position:0%
noticed that representative walner uh is
 
06:12:08.310 --> 06:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
a co-sponsor so i should have been
 
06:12:10.150 --> 06:12:10.160 align:start position:0%
asking her to explain this whole thing
 
06:12:11.510 --> 06:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
to us
 
06:12:14.548 --> 06:12:14.558 align:start position:0%
no mr snaken snow is the expert in this
 
06:12:16.708 --> 06:12:16.718 align:start position:0%
one thank you
 
06:12:18.230 --> 06:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
all right are
 
06:12:20.470 --> 06:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
do we have any more questions from the
 
06:12:22.310 --> 06:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
06:12:25.670 --> 06:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any um mr lipman oh wait
 
06:12:27.990 --> 06:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
a second go ahead just getting back to
 
06:12:30.628 --> 06:12:30.638 align:start position:0%
that issue of carve out um
 
06:12:32.548 --> 06:12:32.558 align:start position:0%
how cumbersome would it be to even do
 
06:12:34.708 --> 06:12:34.718 align:start position:0%
the identification of sort of what
 
06:12:36.390 --> 06:12:36.400 align:start position:0%
they're i mean because most people don't
 
06:12:38.788 --> 06:12:38.798 align:start position:0%
have a single diagnosis um how
 
06:12:40.070 --> 06:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
cumbersome would it be to say we're
 
06:12:41.830 --> 06:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
going to carve out treating only this
 
06:12:41.840 --> 06:12:43.190 align:start position:0%
going to carve out treating only this
particular

06:12:43.190 --> 06:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
particular
 
06:12:44.708 --> 06:12:44.718 align:start position:0%
issue and actually would it be if you
 
06:12:46.788 --> 06:12:46.798 align:start position:0%
were eligible via
 
06:12:48.868 --> 06:12:48.878 align:start position:0%
um having severe mental illness would
 
06:12:51.110 --> 06:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
that enable you to get coverage for all
 
06:12:53.510 --> 06:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
your other medical things so it's either
 
06:12:55.110 --> 06:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
you know you have severe mental illness
 
06:12:56.230 --> 06:12:56.240 align:start position:0%
you have your cover for everything if
 
06:12:57.270 --> 06:12:57.280 align:start position:0%
you don't you're not covered for
 
06:12:59.190 --> 06:12:59.200 align:start position:0%
anything or would it be selectively only
 
06:13:00.548 --> 06:13:00.558 align:start position:0%
covering their mental illness how
 
06:13:01.990 --> 06:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
cumbersome would it be to make those
 
06:13:02.000 --> 06:13:03.350 align:start position:0%
cumbersome would it be to make those
determinations

06:13:03.350 --> 06:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
determinations
 
06:13:05.670 --> 06:13:05.680 align:start position:0%
so so to save time i've withdrawn the
 
06:13:07.910 --> 06:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
idea on the carve out it's not practical
 
06:13:09.750 --> 06:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
do you still want the answer
 
06:13:11.990 --> 06:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
no i think because i yeah no i don't
 
06:13:13.510 --> 06:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
need it then because for that and play
 
06:13:14.628 --> 06:13:14.638 align:start position:0%
not in play
 
06:13:17.030 --> 06:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
yeah i i i i
 
06:13:19.990 --> 06:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
explored it and it doesn't seem to be
 
06:13:21.590 --> 06:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
feasible so
 
06:13:21.600 --> 06:13:22.868 align:start position:0%
feasible so
um

06:13:22.868 --> 06:13:22.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:13:25.750 --> 06:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
okay so mr lipman representative snow
 
06:13:28.230 --> 06:13:28.240 align:start position:0%
what what do you want to say about this
 
06:13:30.708 --> 06:13:30.718 align:start position:0%
bill that you haven't had a chance yet
 
06:13:32.868 --> 06:13:32.878 align:start position:0%
to say i cut you off at one point
 
06:13:35.190 --> 06:13:35.200 align:start position:0%
representatives now
 
06:13:37.030 --> 06:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
i didn't mean to cut you off i was going
 
06:13:40.390 --> 06:13:40.400 align:start position:0%
to i cut you off i'm apologizing
 
06:13:43.430 --> 06:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
anyway no i i i just
 
06:13:45.030 --> 06:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
you feel like
 
06:13:47.030 --> 06:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
i guess you can sense my sense of
 
06:13:49.190 --> 06:13:49.200 align:start position:0%
urgency about getting something done
 
06:13:51.190 --> 06:13:51.200 align:start position:0%
you know over the many years i've worked
 
06:13:53.190 --> 06:13:53.200 align:start position:0%
in this thing i've literally interacted
 
06:13:53.200 --> 06:13:53.990 align:start position:0%
in this thing i've literally interacted
with

06:13:53.990 --> 06:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
with
 
06:13:57.270 --> 06:13:57.280 align:start position:0%
thousands of people that have this
 
06:13:57.280 --> 06:13:58.788 align:start position:0%
thousands of people that have this
severe

06:13:58.788 --> 06:13:58.798 align:start position:0%
severe
 
06:14:01.190 --> 06:14:01.200 align:start position:0%
problem in life with
 
06:14:04.628 --> 06:14:04.638 align:start position:0%
ongoing and persistent mental illness
 
06:14:06.310 --> 06:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
and i'm i'm
 
06:14:08.548 --> 06:14:08.558 align:start position:0%
sympathetic to their struggle and i
 
06:14:11.190 --> 06:14:11.200 align:start position:0%
would i would do anything i think to try
 
06:14:13.350 --> 06:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
to find a way to make their life a
 
06:14:14.868 --> 06:14:14.878 align:start position:0%
little bit easier
 
06:14:16.628 --> 06:14:16.638 align:start position:0%
and not having to make them struggle
 
06:14:18.708 --> 06:14:18.718 align:start position:0%
about documenting how much service
 
06:14:20.070 --> 06:14:20.080 align:start position:0%
they've gotten at the beginning of the
 
06:14:22.548 --> 06:14:22.558 align:start position:0%
month making sure that we have them i
 
06:14:24.230 --> 06:14:24.240 align:start position:0%
think some of the steps that the state's
 
06:14:26.310 --> 06:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
taken by getting a third of the people
 
06:14:28.390 --> 06:14:28.400 align:start position:0%
that are presently in
 
06:14:29.510 --> 06:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
in and out
 
06:14:31.350 --> 06:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
into the regular medicaid program is a
 
06:14:33.670 --> 06:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
huge step in the right direction
 
06:14:35.590 --> 06:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
it is going to cost a little bit
 
06:14:35.600 --> 06:14:36.310 align:start position:0%
it is going to cost a little bit
but

06:14:36.310 --> 06:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:14:38.390 --> 06:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
what it costs the state
 
06:14:40.310 --> 06:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
is automatically going to reduce the
 
06:14:42.390 --> 06:14:42.400 align:start position:0%
amount of bad debt the non-profit
 
06:14:44.470 --> 06:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
organizations that contract with the
 
06:14:46.548 --> 06:14:46.558 align:start position:0%
state to provide service to these
 
06:14:49.030 --> 06:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
individuals come down so that there is a
 
06:14:52.390 --> 06:14:52.400 align:start position:0%
trade and keeping in in
 
06:14:54.070 --> 06:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
in mind the fact
 
06:14:57.030 --> 06:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
that that changes
 
06:14:59.750 --> 06:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:02.310 --> 06:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
we lose all of it you only have to put
 
06:15:02.320 --> 06:15:03.030 align:start position:0%
we lose all of it you only have to put
in

06:15:03.030 --> 06:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:15:05.270 --> 06:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
half of it if you follow
 
06:15:08.070 --> 06:15:08.080 align:start position:0%
the logic so i just hope we can i would
 
06:15:09.990 --> 06:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
love to have this committee be creative
 
06:15:11.990 --> 06:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
if you can only find some way
 
06:15:14.150 --> 06:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
to move this whole thing ahead just a
 
06:15:16.548 --> 06:15:16.558 align:start position:0%
little bit i'd rather see it for
 
06:15:16.558 --> 06:15:17.750 align:start position:0%
little bit i'd rather see it for
everybody

06:15:17.750 --> 06:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
06:15:19.670 --> 06:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
the way it was originally intended so
 
06:15:22.470 --> 06:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
people with kidney disease
 
06:15:26.150 --> 06:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
copd diabetes other illnesses would have
 
06:15:30.390 --> 06:15:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:32.150 --> 06:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
and quite clearly among the people that
 
06:15:34.788 --> 06:15:34.798 align:start position:0%
i work with a lot of them especially the
 
06:15:36.628 --> 06:15:36.638 align:start position:0%
older people that have been around for a
 
06:15:37.670 --> 06:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
long time
 
06:15:39.990 --> 06:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
they have very complicated situations
 
06:15:43.590 --> 06:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
with physical problems which compound
 
06:15:45.350 --> 06:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
the kind of medical problems as you can
 
06:15:45.360 --> 06:15:46.310 align:start position:0%
the kind of medical problems as you can
imagine

06:15:46.310 --> 06:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
imagine
 
06:15:48.548 --> 06:15:48.558 align:start position:0%
makes them much more difficult to manage
 
06:15:48.558 --> 06:15:49.590 align:start position:0%
makes them much more difficult to manage
so

06:15:49.590 --> 06:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:15:51.910 --> 06:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
i i hope we can find some way in the
 
06:15:53.350 --> 06:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
very near future
 
06:15:56.708 --> 06:15:56.718 align:start position:0%
i would be very disappointed if this
 
06:15:59.590 --> 06:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
if the suspension could not be lifted
 
06:16:01.990 --> 06:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
during the second year of this biennium
 
06:16:03.750 --> 06:16:03.760 align:start position:0%
but i certainly hope
 
06:16:05.590 --> 06:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
that the scheduled implementation of
 
06:16:09.190 --> 06:16:09.200 align:start position:0%
this beginning july 1st 2023
 
06:16:10.548 --> 06:16:10.558 align:start position:0%
will take place
 
06:16:12.230 --> 06:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
as it was supposed to
 
06:16:14.150 --> 06:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
is that something that
 
06:16:16.310 --> 06:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
do i understand you to be saying that if
 
06:16:18.390 --> 06:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
we change the effective date the act
 
06:16:21.030 --> 06:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
shall be take effect upon passage if we
 
06:16:23.590 --> 06:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
change that the act will take effect
 
06:16:25.190 --> 06:16:25.200 align:start position:0%
1 july
 
06:16:25.200 --> 06:16:27.430 align:start position:0%
1 july
2023

06:16:27.430 --> 06:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
2023
 
06:16:27.440 --> 06:16:28.470 align:start position:0%
2023
well

06:16:28.470 --> 06:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
well
 
06:16:30.390 --> 06:16:30.400 align:start position:0%
to my way of thinking the law is on the
 
06:16:31.990 --> 06:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
books now
 
06:16:34.150 --> 06:16:34.160 align:start position:0%
and it should be funded within it was
 
06:16:36.788 --> 06:16:36.798 align:start position:0%
suspended for this biennium
 
06:16:39.110 --> 06:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
the additional funding was suspended for
 
06:16:41.670 --> 06:16:41.680 align:start position:0%
this biennium but not beyond this
 
06:16:44.470 --> 06:16:44.480 align:start position:0%
biennium so my assumption is that unless
 
06:16:46.470 --> 06:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
some other action is taken
 
06:16:48.948 --> 06:16:48.958 align:start position:0%
you know to shoot this idea down it
 
06:16:51.670 --> 06:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
would automatically take effect in july
 
06:16:55.990 --> 06:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:58.548 --> 06:16:58.558 align:start position:0%
all right uh the law is on the books in
 
06:17:01.350 --> 06:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
other words yeah mr mr lippman so
 
06:17:01.360 --> 06:17:02.868 align:start position:0%
other words yeah mr mr lippman so
so

06:17:02.868 --> 06:17:02.878 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:17:05.510 --> 06:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
we get a 50 50 match on this i
 
06:17:08.070 --> 06:17:08.080 align:start position:0%
understand so so that means
 
06:17:11.190 --> 06:17:11.200 align:start position:0%
if if the state's going to put in 5.37
 
06:17:12.948 --> 06:17:12.958 align:start position:0%
the feds are going to put in that much
 
06:17:15.590 --> 06:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
so we're talking ab approximately 10.7
 
06:17:18.390 --> 06:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
million dollars total
 
06:17:21.750 --> 06:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
ultimately who is the recipient of that
 
06:17:21.760 --> 06:17:22.628 align:start position:0%
ultimately who is the recipient of that
money

06:17:22.628 --> 06:17:22.638 align:start position:0%
money
 
06:17:25.590 --> 06:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
will that 10.7 basically flow almost
 
06:17:30.390 --> 06:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:32.070 --> 06:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
what would happen is be treated just
 
06:17:34.548 --> 06:17:34.558 align:start position:0%
like any other insurance premium might
 
06:17:36.868 --> 06:17:36.878 align:start position:0%
be we would pay the capitation rate to
 
06:17:39.990 --> 06:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
the mco and the mco would pay the
 
06:17:41.750 --> 06:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
expenses as they're incurred whether
 
06:17:43.590 --> 06:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
they be at a mental health center or
 
06:17:45.430 --> 06:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
what have you um
 
06:17:46.948 --> 06:17:46.958 align:start position:0%
so it
 
06:17:48.868 --> 06:17:48.878 align:start position:0%
it would flow the normal way that we
 
06:17:50.948 --> 06:17:50.958 align:start position:0%
covered generally most of the medicaid
 
06:17:53.190 --> 06:17:53.200 align:start position:0%
population but that's that's for the
 
06:17:53.200 --> 06:17:54.230 align:start position:0%
population but that's that's for the
people

06:17:54.230 --> 06:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
people
 
06:17:56.628 --> 06:17:56.638 align:start position:0%
all right so so give me give me an idea
 
06:17:58.948 --> 06:17:58.958 align:start position:0%
of what that is does that mean 90 will
 
06:18:03.110 --> 06:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
go directly to our providers
 
06:18:03.120 --> 06:18:04.310 align:start position:0%
go directly to our providers
so

06:18:04.310 --> 06:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:18:07.030 --> 06:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
the minimum under our statute
 
06:18:09.110 --> 06:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
in general in the whole program is the
 
06:18:11.990 --> 06:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
minimum of 85 percent is by law has to
 
06:18:14.150 --> 06:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
be spent on medical
 
06:18:14.160 --> 06:18:15.350 align:start position:0%
be spent on medical
services

06:18:15.350 --> 06:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
services
 
06:18:18.628 --> 06:18:18.638 align:start position:0%
um there's a margin for a one and a half
 
06:18:21.590 --> 06:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
percent margin allowed for uh profit
 
06:18:24.390 --> 06:18:24.400 align:start position:0%
built into the rates um there's a
 
06:18:26.230 --> 06:18:26.240 align:start position:0%
premium tax which
 
06:18:28.948 --> 06:18:28.958 align:start position:0%
is two percent and then the balance to
 
06:18:31.590 --> 06:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
85 is administration
 
06:18:31.600 --> 06:18:34.230 align:start position:0%
85 is administration
cost

06:18:34.230 --> 06:18:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:36.708 --> 06:18:36.718 align:start position:0%
one one argument i've heard and i'm just
 
06:18:39.590 --> 06:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
curious how you respond to it is that
 
06:18:40.948 --> 06:18:40.958 align:start position:0%
the state
 
06:18:43.030 --> 06:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
when we mandated that
 
06:18:45.270 --> 06:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
the community health centers had to
 
06:18:47.430 --> 06:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
provide mental health care
 
06:18:50.468 --> 06:18:50.478 align:start position:0%
that we also agreed that um
 
06:18:52.708 --> 06:18:52.718 align:start position:0%
we since we were given them a burden
 
06:18:54.788 --> 06:18:54.798 align:start position:0%
that we would pay 80 percent of their
 
06:18:58.468 --> 06:18:58.478 align:start position:0%
costs you know without documentation of
 
06:18:58.478 --> 06:18:59.750 align:start position:0%
costs you know without documentation of
volume

06:18:59.750 --> 06:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
volume
 
06:18:59.760 --> 06:19:01.350 align:start position:0%
volume
um

06:19:01.350 --> 06:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:19:04.390 --> 06:19:04.400 align:start position:0%
and that because we're already paying 80
 
06:19:06.390 --> 06:19:06.400 align:start position:0%
of their expenses
 
06:19:08.708 --> 06:19:08.718 align:start position:0%
this bad debt although it sounds
 
06:19:12.070 --> 06:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
significant in effect is not all that
 
06:19:14.070 --> 06:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
dramatic because we've already covered
 
06:19:16.070 --> 06:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
80 percent of their expenses would you
 
06:19:19.830 --> 06:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:23.270 --> 06:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
or can you does that sound familiar
 
06:19:25.750 --> 06:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
it doesn't honestly but
 
06:19:29.030 --> 06:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
it could it could ben before my time but
 
06:19:31.030 --> 06:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
i think um
 
06:19:32.708 --> 06:19:32.718 align:start position:0%
the way that mental health centers
 
06:19:34.788 --> 06:19:34.798 align:start position:0%
receive a large portion of that money is
 
06:19:37.270 --> 06:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
through a capitation a sub-capitation
 
06:19:40.468 --> 06:19:40.478 align:start position:0%
arrangement that they have with the mc
 
06:19:42.468 --> 06:19:42.478 align:start position:0%
managed care organizations
 
06:19:43.590 --> 06:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
and so
 
06:19:43.600 --> 06:19:45.910 align:start position:0%
and so
um

06:19:45.910 --> 06:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:45.920 --> 06:19:47.350 align:start position:0%
 
there

06:19:47.350 --> 06:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
there
 
06:19:48.948 --> 06:19:48.958 align:start position:0%
there's a portion that they get fifa
 
06:19:52.830 --> 06:19:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:52.840 --> 06:19:54.628 align:start position:0%
 
the

06:19:54.628 --> 06:19:54.638 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:19:57.910 --> 06:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
i don't have a an answer to the 80
 
06:19:57.920 --> 06:19:58.948 align:start position:0%
i don't have a an answer to the 80
percent

06:19:58.948 --> 06:19:58.958 align:start position:0%
percent
 
06:20:01.670 --> 06:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
issue that you you mentioned um
 
06:20:03.350 --> 06:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
but you know i think that
 
06:20:03.360 --> 06:20:04.230 align:start position:0%
but you know i think that
the

06:20:04.230 --> 06:20:04.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:20:04.240 --> 06:20:05.750 align:start position:0%
the
financial

06:20:05.750 --> 06:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
financial
 
06:20:07.670 --> 06:20:07.680 align:start position:0%
position of the
 
06:20:09.830 --> 06:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
the managed care organizations i mean
 
06:20:11.430 --> 06:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
excuse me the mental health centers is
 
06:20:13.350 --> 06:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
really that
 
06:20:15.510 --> 06:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to provide this service
 
06:20:16.868 --> 06:20:16.878 align:start position:0%
you're just
 
06:20:18.788 --> 06:20:18.798 align:start position:0%
because of you haven't raised the income
 
06:20:21.190 --> 06:20:21.200 align:start position:0%
limits since 19
 
06:20:24.310 --> 06:20:24.320 align:start position:0%
whatever the date was that we're having
 
06:20:27.030 --> 06:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
to absorb that that doesn't seem fair to
 
06:20:29.670 --> 06:20:29.680 align:start position:0%
the clients that we serve or to or to us
 
06:20:30.868 --> 06:20:30.878 align:start position:0%
i think that's
 
06:20:33.430 --> 06:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
what the argument basically boils down
 
06:20:36.548 --> 06:20:36.558 align:start position:0%
to and i i think the the continuity of
 
06:20:37.910 --> 06:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
knowing that you have
 
06:20:39.350 --> 06:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
coverage and you're not having to worry
 
06:20:41.830 --> 06:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
whether you're in and out is
 
06:20:44.390 --> 06:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
probably um therapeutically beneficial
 
06:20:49.110 --> 06:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:50.948 --> 06:20:50.958 align:start position:0%
all right thank you it was a tough
 
06:20:52.628 --> 06:20:52.638 align:start position:0%
question you did it
 
06:20:55.110 --> 06:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
pretty well given that i probably was
 
06:20:57.750 --> 06:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
making things up there so
 
06:20:59.910 --> 06:20:59.920 align:start position:0%
representative snow i think we also need
 
06:21:01.510 --> 06:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
to keep in mind we're talking about two
 
06:21:03.590 --> 06:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
different groups of people you talked
 
06:21:05.990 --> 06:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
about the 80 and so forth that's for the
 
06:21:07.670 --> 06:21:07.680 align:start position:0%
people who are in the regular medicaid
 
06:21:07.680 --> 06:21:08.628 align:start position:0%
people who are in the regular medicaid
program

06:21:08.628 --> 06:21:08.638 align:start position:0%
program
 
06:21:10.948 --> 06:21:10.958 align:start position:0%
under this jurisdiction of one of those
 
06:21:13.590 --> 06:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
three managed care companies that run it
 
06:21:15.190 --> 06:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
the people under the
 
06:21:16.868 --> 06:21:16.878 align:start position:0%
in and out program
 
06:21:18.468 --> 06:21:18.478 align:start position:0%
would not be considered that way because
 
06:21:21.110 --> 06:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
there is the only reimbursement that we
 
06:21:21.120 --> 06:21:22.230 align:start position:0%
there is the only reimbursement that we
get

06:21:22.230 --> 06:21:22.240 align:start position:0%
get
 
06:21:25.110 --> 06:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
is the fee for service fee which is the
 
06:21:26.948 --> 06:21:26.958 align:start position:0%
same fee that everybody else pays we
 
06:21:29.270 --> 06:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
don't raise the fees on them it's the
 
06:21:30.468 --> 06:21:30.478 align:start position:0%
same fee
 
06:21:32.548 --> 06:21:32.558 align:start position:0%
we only collect those fees once that
 
06:21:33.750 --> 06:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
spend down
 
06:21:35.350 --> 06:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
has been met
 
06:21:35.360 --> 06:21:37.110 align:start position:0%
has been met
and

06:21:37.110 --> 06:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:21:40.390 --> 06:21:40.400 align:start position:0%
that's what i'm trying to seek to avoid
 
06:21:42.948 --> 06:21:42.958 align:start position:0%
and that's what adds up to that
 
06:21:42.958 --> 06:21:43.670 align:start position:0%
and that's what adds up to that
uh

06:21:43.670 --> 06:21:43.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:21:45.110 --> 06:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
to that debt
 
06:21:47.910 --> 06:21:47.920 align:start position:0%
which is pretty substantial
 
06:21:49.110 --> 06:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
all right i
 
06:21:51.910 --> 06:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
i go ahead mr lemon
 
06:21:53.750 --> 06:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
try to respect where you were going with
 
06:21:56.150 --> 06:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
this originally if you mind i could ask
 
06:21:58.468 --> 06:21:58.478 align:start position:0%
don landry to a question here because
 
06:22:00.468 --> 06:22:00.478 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if there is a
 
06:22:02.788 --> 06:22:02.798 align:start position:0%
um well we can't
 
06:22:05.830 --> 06:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
rule out the the blind disable the
 
06:22:07.350 --> 06:22:07.360 align:start position:0%
the fragile
 
06:22:09.190 --> 06:22:09.200 align:start position:0%
i just want to confirm with her if i
 
06:22:09.200 --> 06:22:16.868 align:start position:0%
i just want to confirm with her if i
could

06:22:16.868 --> 06:22:16.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:18.548 --> 06:22:18.558 align:start position:0%
so the question i want to ask don in
 
06:22:21.590 --> 06:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:24.788 --> 06:22:24.798 align:start position:0%
well there are these groups that we
 
06:22:26.868 --> 06:22:26.878 align:start position:0%
have to include which groups could we
 
06:22:29.430 --> 06:22:29.440 align:start position:0%
not include is there are there any in
 
06:22:34.868 --> 06:22:34.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:36.628 --> 06:22:36.638 align:start position:0%
hi good afternoon my name is don landry
 
06:22:38.548 --> 06:22:38.558 align:start position:0%
i'm a medicaid policy administrator with
 
06:22:40.948 --> 06:22:40.958 align:start position:0%
the department
 
06:22:43.430 --> 06:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
so it's it's called a medically needy
 
06:22:43.440 --> 06:22:44.310 align:start position:0%
so it's it's called a medically needy
group

06:22:44.310 --> 06:22:44.320 align:start position:0%
group
 
06:22:46.868 --> 06:22:46.878 align:start position:0%
um generally speaking medically needy is
 
06:22:49.110 --> 06:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
an option for states and right now the
 
06:22:49.120 --> 06:22:51.830 align:start position:0%
an option for states and right now the
only

06:22:51.830 --> 06:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:54.230 --> 06:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
groups we could potentially eliminate
 
06:22:56.788 --> 06:22:56.798 align:start position:0%
would be for like pregnant women and
 
06:22:59.270 --> 06:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
children but i would not
 
06:23:00.708 --> 06:23:00.718 align:start position:0%
say a hundred percent for children
 
06:23:01.990 --> 06:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
because i do believe we still have
 
06:23:03.910 --> 06:23:03.920 align:start position:0%
maintenance of effort requirements for
 
06:23:03.920 --> 06:23:05.190 align:start position:0%
maintenance of effort requirements for
kids

06:23:05.190 --> 06:23:05.200 align:start position:0%
kids
 
06:23:05.200 --> 06:23:06.468 align:start position:0%
kids
um

06:23:06.468 --> 06:23:06.478 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:23:08.468 --> 06:23:08.478 align:start position:0%
other than that we do have to have the
 
06:23:10.390 --> 06:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
spend down program for the age blind and
 
06:23:10.400 --> 06:23:14.948 align:start position:0%
spend down program for the age blind and
disabled

06:23:14.948 --> 06:23:14.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:14.958 --> 06:23:15.750 align:start position:0%
 
thanks

06:23:15.750 --> 06:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
06:23:17.590 --> 06:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
all right so i
 
06:23:20.070 --> 06:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
want to reaffirm that i am not
 
06:23:25.910 --> 06:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:25.920 --> 06:23:26.868 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

06:23:26.868 --> 06:23:26.878 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
06:23:30.070 --> 06:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:32.548 --> 06:23:32.558 align:start position:0%
i i think i think we're full i i think
 
06:23:35.590 --> 06:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
we've heard everything uh you know i
 
06:23:38.948 --> 06:23:38.958 align:start position:0%
part of um the reason i've had so many
 
06:23:41.510 --> 06:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
questions i i i just was unfamiliar with
 
06:23:43.510 --> 06:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
this program and i i still feel like i
 
06:23:44.788 --> 06:23:44.798 align:start position:0%
pretty much am
 
06:23:44.798 --> 06:23:45.590 align:start position:0%
pretty much am
um

06:23:45.590 --> 06:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:23:47.430 --> 06:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
i think if i were to summarize what
 
06:23:49.270 --> 06:23:49.280 align:start position:0%
we're talking about doing is we're
 
06:23:52.230 --> 06:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
trying to make up for 30 years of
 
06:23:52.240 --> 06:23:54.030 align:start position:0%
trying to make up for 30 years of
holding

06:23:54.030 --> 06:23:54.040 align:start position:0%
holding
 
06:23:57.110 --> 06:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
eligibility levels flat
 
06:23:59.830 --> 06:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
and that just by recognizing some
 
06:24:01.670 --> 06:24:01.680 align:start position:0%
inflationary effect
 
06:24:03.910 --> 06:24:03.920 align:start position:0%
some not all
 
06:24:07.990 --> 06:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
it in effect would increase our costs uh
 
06:24:10.628 --> 06:24:10.638 align:start position:0%
at the state level for by about 5.3
 
06:24:10.638 --> 06:24:11.510 align:start position:0%
at the state level for by about 5.3
million

06:24:11.510 --> 06:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
million
 
06:24:14.070 --> 06:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
doubled if you include the federal money
 
06:24:16.468 --> 06:24:16.478 align:start position:0%
of which about 85 will flow to our
 
06:24:16.478 --> 06:24:17.750 align:start position:0%
of which about 85 will flow to our
network

06:24:17.750 --> 06:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
network
 
06:24:17.760 --> 06:24:18.548 align:start position:0%
network
so

06:24:18.548 --> 06:24:18.558 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:24:20.708 --> 06:24:20.718 align:start position:0%
um so these are these are vital
 
06:24:23.110 --> 06:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
resources needed for a major component
 
06:24:25.510 --> 06:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
of our entire um
 
06:24:29.110 --> 06:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
network of community health systems so
 
06:24:29.120 --> 06:24:29.990 align:start position:0%
network of community health systems so
um

06:24:29.990 --> 06:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:24:33.350 --> 06:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
i i just need to go back to my boss and
 
06:24:36.070 --> 06:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
her boss and and find out
 
06:24:37.430 --> 06:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
you know because the governor's going
 
06:24:40.150 --> 06:24:40.160 align:start position:0%
through a process right he's got this
 
06:24:42.230 --> 06:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
program where he's looking at
 
06:24:44.628 --> 06:24:44.638 align:start position:0%
all the things he wants to spend some of
 
06:24:47.110 --> 06:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
the excess revenue on and i just want to
 
06:24:49.910 --> 06:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
see where this program racks and stacks
 
06:24:52.070 --> 06:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
in the governor's vision and to what
 
06:24:54.230 --> 06:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
extent that we would need to you know
 
06:24:56.468 --> 06:24:56.478 align:start position:0%
negotiate something there so i'll try to
 
06:24:58.628 --> 06:24:58.638 align:start position:0%
get that done by monday which is not
 
06:25:01.590 --> 06:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
easy given we have three session days
 
06:25:03.590 --> 06:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
so if maybe the governor will just come
 
06:25:07.990 --> 06:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:08.000 --> 06:25:08.788 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

06:25:08.788 --> 06:25:08.798 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
06:25:11.670 --> 06:25:11.680 align:start position:0%
all right all right so if uh no oh
 
06:25:13.670 --> 06:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
representative snow i was just trying to
 
06:25:15.990 --> 06:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
wrap up
 
06:25:16.948 --> 06:25:16.958 align:start position:0%
i just
 
06:25:18.468 --> 06:25:18.478 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to thank you for your
 
06:25:20.070 --> 06:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
patience and listening to what we had to
 
06:25:20.080 --> 06:25:20.868 align:start position:0%
patience and listening to what we had to
say

06:25:20.868 --> 06:25:20.878 align:start position:0%
say
 
06:25:23.430 --> 06:25:23.440 align:start position:0%
and i hope somehow between us we can
 
06:25:25.030 --> 06:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
come up with some kind of a solution to
 
06:25:27.350 --> 06:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
meet the needs of this very needy group
 
06:25:29.350 --> 06:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
thank you all right all right thank you
 
06:25:30.468 --> 06:25:30.478 align:start position:0%
so with that
 
06:25:34.150 --> 06:25:34.160 align:start position:0%
uh i'm going to close the hearing on uh
 
06:25:36.868 --> 06:25:36.878 align:start position:0%
hp 1526
 
06:25:40.150 --> 06:25:40.160 align:start position:0%
and uh i want to open up what what might
 
06:25:43.190 --> 06:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
be a relatively short conversation on
 
06:25:43.200 --> 06:25:45.670 align:start position:0%
be a relatively short conversation on
1531.

06:25:45.670 --> 06:25:45.680 align:start position:0%
1531.
 
06:25:56.628 --> 06:25:56.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:58.390 --> 06:25:58.400 align:start position:0%
representative knurk are you prepared to
 
06:26:01.190 --> 06:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
talk to this without a coincidence
 
06:26:03.030 --> 06:26:03.040 align:start position:0%
actually this one did not come to our
 
06:26:05.350 --> 06:26:05.360 align:start position:0%
committee and so i am no more familiar
 
06:26:08.310 --> 06:26:08.320 align:start position:0%
with this than anybody else is okay so
 
06:26:10.868 --> 06:26:10.878 align:start position:0%
so mr ripple i'm i'm gonna say what i
 
06:26:12.868 --> 06:26:12.878 align:start position:0%
think is true and then i want you to
 
06:26:15.590 --> 06:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
correct me and extend it to the extent
 
06:26:18.948 --> 06:26:18.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:21.510 --> 06:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
06:26:24.788 --> 06:26:24.798 align:start position:0%
what all this got amended to doing
 
06:26:26.868 --> 06:26:26.878 align:start position:0%
was repealing
 
06:26:26.878 --> 06:26:27.990 align:start position:0%
was repealing
um

06:26:27.990 --> 06:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:26:28.000 --> 06:26:29.270 align:start position:0%
um
two

06:26:29.270 --> 06:26:29.280 align:start position:0%
two
 
06:26:31.670 --> 06:26:31.680 align:start position:0%
parts of the commissions that we had
 
06:26:31.680 --> 06:26:33.350 align:start position:0%
parts of the commissions that we had
established

06:26:33.350 --> 06:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
established
 
06:26:35.990 --> 06:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
and although in the original bill is
 
06:26:39.590 --> 06:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
introduced there there was a fiscal note
 
06:26:42.788 --> 06:26:42.798 align:start position:0%
that's about 150 000. when we go to just
 
06:26:44.628 --> 06:26:44.638 align:start position:0%
these repeals
 
06:26:47.910 --> 06:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
i i think there is probably no fiscal
 
06:26:47.920 --> 06:26:49.590 align:start position:0%
i i think there is probably no fiscal
impact

06:26:49.590 --> 06:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
impact
 
06:26:51.190 --> 06:26:51.200 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
06:26:53.590 --> 06:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
and actually this may be one of those
 
06:26:55.750 --> 06:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
negative things if we don't
 
06:26:57.750 --> 06:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
have a commission then
 
06:26:59.990 --> 06:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
maybe we actually save some money
 
06:27:04.310 --> 06:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
so i i'm thinking that if it's a
 
06:27:06.708 --> 06:27:06.718 align:start position:0%
negative number or a zero number on the
 
06:27:08.868 --> 06:27:08.878 align:start position:0%
on the fiscal impact this is one that we
 
06:27:10.708 --> 06:27:10.718 align:start position:0%
would probably just
 
06:27:10.718 --> 06:27:11.590 align:start position:0%
would probably just
um

06:27:11.590 --> 06:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:27:15.750 --> 06:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
do a formality and otping it next monday
 
06:27:15.760 --> 06:27:16.868 align:start position:0%
do a formality and otping it next monday
um

06:27:16.868 --> 06:27:16.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:27:19.350 --> 06:27:19.360 align:start position:0%
mr ripple how'd i do how would you
 
06:27:21.670 --> 06:27:21.680 align:start position:0%
correct or extend what i said uh i think
 
06:27:23.430 --> 06:27:23.440 align:start position:0%
it's true if you've seen the revised
 
06:27:25.110 --> 06:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
fiscal note that i think we
 
06:27:27.270 --> 06:27:27.280 align:start position:0%
put out over the weekend it states
 
06:27:28.788 --> 06:27:28.798 align:start position:0%
there's no fiscal impact to the bill as
 
06:27:28.798 --> 06:27:31.910 align:start position:0%
there's no fiscal impact to the bill as
amended

06:27:31.910 --> 06:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:34.230 --> 06:27:34.240 align:start position:0%
uh mr representative irv
 
06:27:36.230 --> 06:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
thank you i did speak with
 
06:27:37.750 --> 06:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
representative rice
 
06:27:40.628 --> 06:27:40.638 align:start position:0%
and yes your your presentation was
 
06:27:40.638 --> 06:27:41.670 align:start position:0%
and yes your your presentation was
accurate

06:27:41.670 --> 06:27:41.680 align:start position:0%
accurate
 
06:27:43.110 --> 06:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
there's actually another side to this
 
06:27:45.270 --> 06:27:45.280 align:start position:0%
and that is that this even though these
 
06:27:46.628 --> 06:27:46.638 align:start position:0%
commissions themselves are being
 
06:27:49.110 --> 06:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
eliminated in statute they're actually
 
06:27:51.110 --> 06:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
being incorporated into
 
06:27:52.390 --> 06:27:52.400 align:start position:0%
other commissions that already exist for
 
06:27:53.590 --> 06:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
these purposes and apparently that's
 
06:27:55.350 --> 06:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
coming through in the senate bill so i
 
06:27:57.510 --> 06:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
agree with your otp
 
06:27:57.520 --> 06:27:58.788 align:start position:0%
agree with your otp
indication

06:27:58.788 --> 06:27:58.798 align:start position:0%
indication
 
06:28:00.708 --> 06:28:00.718 align:start position:0%
so the military way of thinking about
 
06:28:02.390 --> 06:28:02.400 align:start position:0%
that is they're just reassigning the
 
06:28:05.350 --> 06:28:05.360 align:start position:0%
mission to other existing organizations
 
06:28:06.628 --> 06:28:06.638 align:start position:0%
uh okay
 
06:28:07.910 --> 06:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
very good
 
06:28:09.910 --> 06:28:09.920 align:start position:0%
so um
 
06:28:12.070 --> 06:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
so i laid out a proposal that we vote on
 
06:28:14.390 --> 06:28:14.400 align:start position:0%
this on monday it should be an easy vote
 
06:28:16.628 --> 06:28:16.638 align:start position:0%
or really just a courtesy to
 
06:28:19.350 --> 06:28:19.360 align:start position:0%
representative rogers
 
06:28:21.990 --> 06:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
or we could vote on it now would would
 
06:28:22.000 --> 06:28:23.270 align:start position:0%
or we could vote on it now would would

yeah so we're actually we're going to
 
06:29:08.548 --> 06:29:08.558 align:start position:0%
put everything we did today
 
06:29:11.350 --> 06:29:11.360 align:start position:0%
on monday because we didn't get a good
 
06:29:12.708 --> 06:29:12.718 align:start position:0%
vote on those
 
06:29:16.230 --> 06:29:16.240 align:start position:0%
plus i think it was 1647 that um
 
06:29:18.628 --> 06:29:18.638 align:start position:0%
division one slid to us
 
06:29:18.638 --> 06:29:19.830 align:start position:0%
division one slid to us
that

06:29:19.830 --> 06:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:29:21.670 --> 06:29:21.680 align:start position:0%
that that needs to be added so
 
06:29:23.270 --> 06:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
technically we've got we picked up
 
06:29:24.548 --> 06:29:24.558 align:start position:0%
another bill
 
06:29:26.390 --> 06:29:26.400 align:start position:0%
and and that one we don't know anything
 
06:29:29.350 --> 06:29:29.360 align:start position:0%
about so i'm going to do that last so
 
06:29:31.350 --> 06:29:31.360 align:start position:0%
that we can run through the the first
 
06:29:34.070 --> 06:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
ones uh fairly quickly and then spend
 
06:29:39.830 --> 06:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:42.548 --> 06:29:42.558 align:start position:0%
are we done okay so with that i
 
06:29:44.708 --> 06:29:44.718 align:start position:0%
adjourned today's work session on
 
06:30:21.510 --> 06:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
