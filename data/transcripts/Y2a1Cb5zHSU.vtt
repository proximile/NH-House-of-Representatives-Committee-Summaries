of this
 
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
ideology totalitarian ideology that was
 
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 align:start position:0%
that came into power a little over a
 
00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
hundred years ago
 
00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 align:start position:0%
um in russia
 
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 align:start position:0%
uh under the bolshevik
 
00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.550 align:start position:0%
uh under the bolshevik
regime

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 align:start position:0%
regime
 
00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 align:start position:0%
it's been with us since then and it's
 
00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 align:start position:0%
been tried in as the bill states about
 
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
40 other nations
 
00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 align:start position:0%
it spread through the world
 
00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:33.830 align:start position:0%
it spread through the world
and

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 align:start position:0%
it caused
 
00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:36.950 align:start position:0%
it caused
many

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
many
 
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.069 align:start position:0%
many
millions

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:38.079 align:start position:0%
millions
 
00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 align:start position:0%
of deaths
 
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
probably over 100 million
 
00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 align:start position:0%
some people say between 100 and 200
 
00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 align:start position:0%
million deaths who are caused by this
 
00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 align:start position:0%
experiments and this is something that
 
00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 align:start position:0%
we should
 
00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 align:start position:0%
this is probably the
 
00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 align:start position:0%
biggest evil that we lived through so
 
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.230 align:start position:0%
biggest evil that we lived through so
far

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
far
 
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 align:start position:0%
and we should hope to not repeat it
 
00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:04.719 align:start position:0%
that's why this date is being recognized
 
00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
in multiple states um
 
00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
14 states have legislation that
 
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 align:start position:0%
commemorate november 7th as the date for
 
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 align:start position:0%
this is also an international
 
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 align:start position:0%
recognized date more or less
 
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
because again this dates back to the
 
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 align:start position:0%
bolshevik revolution of russia which
 
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.470 align:start position:0%
bolshevik revolution of russia which
began

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 align:start position:0%
began
 
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
the regimes
 
00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 align:start position:0%
and the slaughter
 
00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 align:start position:0%
of you know 100 million people
 
00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 align:start position:0%
um the bill list
 
00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
all the other many other regimes
 
00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 align:start position:0%
throughout the world that has have tried
 
00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 align:start position:0%
this ideology have tried this
 
00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:54.879 align:start position:0%
absolute power given to the leaders
 
00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 align:start position:0%
it didn't work out
 
00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 align:start position:0%
for them either we're talking about
 
00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:59.830 align:start position:0%
for them either we're talking about
china

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 align:start position:0%
china
 
00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 align:start position:0%
under mao we're talking about
 
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.030 align:start position:0%
under mao we're talking about
vietnam

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
vietnam
 
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.630 align:start position:0%
 
cuba

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.430 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 align:start position:0%

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
victims of communism that are mentioned
 
00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:03.199 align:start position:0%
in this bill
 
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
while i was only six years old when my
 
00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
parents fled communist hungary in 1956
 
00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
and did not personally feel persecuted
 
00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
many of my family members and friends
 
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 align:start position:0%
suffered under that government including
 
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
imprisonment torture and various forms
 
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
of harassment
 
00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
one of my uncles who was a jesus priest
 
00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
and a representative of the vatican in
 
00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
hungary was arrested and tortured while
 
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
in prison
 
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
other relatives had been banished from
 
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
living near their relatives
 
00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
or provided with
 
00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:39.759 align:start position:0%
only inadequate housing and relatively
 
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
lowly jobs
 
00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:43.199 align:start position:0%
while their children suffered various
 
00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:45.919 align:start position:0%
forms of discrimination
 
00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.600 align:start position:0%
my own father who came from an
 
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 align:start position:0%
aristocratic family but who was not
 
00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:52.400 align:start position:0%
involved with politics at all
 
00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:54.479 align:start position:0%
was never allowed to keep a job very
 
00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:56.720 align:start position:0%
long and was labeled an enemy of the
 
00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.390 align:start position:0%
long and was labeled an enemy of the
people

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
we also had many friends of our family
 
00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.080 align:start position:0%
who suffered various forms of
 
00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.590 align:start position:0%
who suffered various forms of
persecution

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
persecution
 
00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
so i understand firsthand what the
 
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
communist hungarian government did to
 
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:13.919 align:start position:0%
this is why since 2016 i have been

my family's experience was also partly
 
00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
the reason why in 1971
 
00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:41.600 align:start position:0%
when i was a physics student at the
 
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:44.160 align:start position:0%

as some of you may remember in 1971 the
 
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
world was politically quite different
 
00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
from what it is today
 
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
some of the prisoners that i had was

hungary
 
00:07:49.589 --> 00:07:49.599 align:start position:0%
i learned much over those years about
 
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
different cultures and about human
 
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
rights violations including torture
 
00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
during the course of many years of
 
00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
working on these cases it became clear
 
00:07:59.510 --> 00:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
to me
 
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
that no ideology has a monopoly on human
 
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
rights violations or torture
 
00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
whether we are talking about the nazi
 
00:08:10.309 --> 00:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
atrocities against the jews in europe or
 
00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:13.360 align:start position:0%
the pogroms instigated by stalin
 
00:08:15.749 --> 00:08:15.759 align:start position:0%
human beings are the victims of both
 
00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:19.280 align:start position:0%
ideologies and authoritarian governments
 
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
i could pick up any particular prisoner
 
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
case sheet
 
00:08:25.029 --> 00:08:25.039 align:start position:0%
and if i covered up the country of
 
00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
origin and just read the details of the
 
00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:28.390 align:start position:0%
origin and just read the details of the
case

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
case
 
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
i could not tell you whether that
 
00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
government was a communist government a
 
00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
military dictatorship or just an
 
00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
authoritarian regime
 
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
and in fact the victims of such
 
00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:38.870 align:start position:0%
and in fact the victims of such
governments

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
governments
 
00:08:41.269 --> 00:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
could care less what their torturers
 
00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
were using as justification
 
00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:46.720 align:start position:0%
for example the nazi government arrested
 
00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
and killed political opponents
 
00:08:50.949 --> 00:08:50.959 align:start position:0%
religious students such as members of
 
00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
the white rose
 
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
conscientious objectors
 
00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
homosexuals people with disabilities
 
00:08:59.350 --> 00:08:59.360 align:start position:0%
labor union leaders and the proponents
 
00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
of democratic rights
 
00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
they were an equal opportunity
 
00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:04.470 align:start position:0%
they were an equal opportunity
persecutor

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
persecutor
 
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:07.360 align:start position:0%
as are most dictatorships
 
00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
because of my experience working in
 
00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
human rights i have developed a great
 
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:13.360 align:start position:0%
empathy for all victims of human rights
 
00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:14.870 align:start position:0%
empathy for all victims of human rights
violations

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
violations
 
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
it is still shocking to me that even the
 
00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
countries of the world that signed on to
 
00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
the 1948 universal declaration of human
 
00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.070 align:start position:0%
the 1948 universal declaration of human
rights

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
rights
 
00:09:26.389 --> 00:09:26.399 align:start position:0%
that they are today still violating many
 
00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
of those promises
 
00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
i thank the sponsors of this bill for
 
00:09:33.269 --> 00:09:33.279 align:start position:0%
acknowledging the victims of communism
 
00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:35.200 align:start position:0%
but i would respectfully ask them to
 
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
consider all victims persecuted for
 
00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
exercising their human rights
 
00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:42.240 align:start position:0%
this committee could do that by
 
00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
expanding the range of victims and
 
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:46.720 align:start position:0%
designating a victims of oppression
 
00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:48.160 align:start position:0%
memorial day
 
00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:50.240 align:start position:0%
and since december 10th is already
 
00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:52.640 align:start position:0%
recognized worldwide as a human rights
 
00:09:54.949 --> 00:09:54.959 align:start position:0%
as human rights day it would make sense
 
00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
to use that day to remember the victims
 
00:09:59.910 --> 00:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
of oppression on that day
 
00:10:01.829 --> 00:10:01.839 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i'd be glad to
 
00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
answer any questions
 
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:11.509 --> 00:10:11.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none i'll close the public
 
00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:34.550 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none i'll close the public
hearing

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
representative sentence so you have a
 
00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:41.590 align:start position:0%
representative sentence so you have a
motion

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:44.160 align:start position:0%
uh yes i'll make a motion uh
 
00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:44.949 align:start position:0%
uh yes i'll make a motion uh
to

00:10:44.949 --> 00:10:44.959 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
for house bill
 
00:10:55.829 --> 00:10:55.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:55.839 --> 00:10:58.630 align:start position:0%
 
second

00:10:58.630 --> 00:10:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
did we just end public testimony and
 
00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.190 align:start position:0%
did we just end public testimony and
enter

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:09.200 align:start position:0%
enter
 
00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
an executive session yes okay i didn't
 
00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:14.720 align:start position:0%
hear that i'm sorry thank you i wasn't
 
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
explicit enough my fault i did however
 
00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
uh yes uh
 
00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:28.720 align:start position:0%
so communism uh
 
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:30.720 align:start position:0%
you know i read the first volume of uh
 
00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:32.720 align:start position:0%
the ghoul like archipelago by
 
00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh alexandra scholskinskin and what that
 
00:11:37.829 --> 00:11:37.839 align:start position:0%
book taught me is that communism is
 
00:11:40.829 --> 00:11:40.839 align:start position:0%
it's worse than you can imagine
 
00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
um but this kind of bill
 
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
you know we've kind of decided as a
 
00:11:47.829 --> 00:11:47.839 align:start position:0%
committee that this kind of waters down
 
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
the actual underlining issue and the
 
00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
best way to handle this kind of thing is
 
00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:52.230 align:start position:0%
best way to handle this kind of thing is
to

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:52.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.509 align:start position:0%
to
uh

00:11:53.509 --> 00:11:53.519 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
is to not put into statue you know
 
00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:57.190 align:start position:0%
is to not put into statue you know
decorations

00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:57.200 align:start position:0%
decorations
 
00:11:59.030 --> 00:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
to order the governor to make
 
00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:00.230 align:start position:0%
to order the governor to make
declarations

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
declarations
 
00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
as such and it'd be better served
 
00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:08.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative blackis
 
00:12:10.629 --> 00:12:10.639 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:12:13.269 --> 00:12:13.279 align:start position:0%
i agree and um
 
00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
i'm you know supporting the ital sort of
 
00:12:18.389 --> 00:12:18.399 align:start position:0%
uncomfortably with a heavy heart i'm
 
00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
you know i'm very aware of
 
00:12:22.949 --> 00:12:22.959 align:start position:0%
of you know what happened what the
 
00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:24.720 align:start position:0%
communists have done my father fought on
 
00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
the anti-communist side in the greek
 
00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
civil war
 
00:12:30.069 --> 00:12:30.079 align:start position:0%
i had a great grandmother who left
 
00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
moscow in 1913 a good year to get out
 
00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
but actually i think
 
00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
as was mentioned by the representative
 
00:12:40.389 --> 00:12:40.399 align:start position:0%
who spoke
 
00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
the proper way to the more effective way
 
00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:44.720 align:start position:0%
of commemorating is for groups of people
 
00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
to organize things like the
 
00:12:48.389 --> 00:12:48.399 align:start position:0%
commemoration of the hungarian
 
00:12:48.399 --> 00:12:49.750 align:start position:0%
commemoration of the hungarian
revolution

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
revolution
 
00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:50.790 align:start position:0%
revolution
and

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
they can ask the governor petition the
 
00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:54.240 align:start position:0%
governor to sign a resolution which
 
00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
he'll generally do
 
00:12:58.150 --> 00:12:58.160 align:start position:0%
the problem is there's a lot of these uh
 
00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:00.240 align:start position:0%
in statute and if you go and ask most
 
00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.190 align:start position:0%
in statute and if you go and ask most
people

00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:01.200 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
they won't even know what most of them
 
00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
are about
 
00:13:05.509 --> 00:13:05.519 align:start position:0%
and so you know they get put in statute
 
00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
and forgotten probably the governor's
 
00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:08.720 align:start position:0%
staff on the right days gives them
 
00:13:10.389 --> 00:13:10.399 align:start position:0%
something to sign and it's issues a
 
00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
press release and nobody notices
 
00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:13.350 align:start position:0%
press release and nobody notices
anything

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
anything
 
00:13:15.509 --> 00:13:15.519 align:start position:0%
so i applaud people who
 
00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
in groups who put the effort into
 
00:13:19.509 --> 00:13:19.519 align:start position:0%
commemorating such days and
 
00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
but i don't think this is a
 
00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
useful way of handling it thank you
 
00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i will also
 
00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
support the ito
 
00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
and let me try to rephrase it what uh
 
00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
but representative lekka said
 
00:13:39.829 --> 00:13:39.839 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
receives a lot of requests for
 
00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
days honoring an event
 
00:13:48.629 --> 00:13:48.639 align:start position:0%
and we have so many of them
 
00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
that and there's no way really
 
00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.750 align:start position:0%
that and there's no way really
to

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:13:55.509 --> 00:13:55.519 align:start position:0%
for the state
 
00:13:55.519 --> 00:13:56.710 align:start position:0%
for the state
to

00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:13:58.790 --> 00:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
recognize them other than just put them
 
00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
on this calendar
 
00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:02.720 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
there has been a policy of this
 
00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.150 align:start position:0%
there has been a policy of this
committee

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:06.160 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
not to
 
00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
to to
 
00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
to deem these bills in expedient to
 
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.430 align:start position:0%
to deem these bills in expedient to
legislate

00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:16.820 align:start position:0%
in the hopes that those people who are
 
00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:19.350 align:start position:0%
in the hopes that those people who are
[Music]

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:48.720 align:start position:0%
and i too will support the itl um
 
00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:49.990 align:start position:0%
and i too will support the itl um
and

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
i was unaware and i'm sure
 
00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
a number of folks here were probably
 
00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:56.720 align:start position:0%
unaware that november 7th is already a
 
00:14:58.870 --> 00:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
national holiday a national celebrated
 
00:15:00.629 --> 00:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
nationally for this
 
00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
in the books as a national uh event
 
00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:09.750 align:start position:0%
in the books as a national uh event
and

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:15:11.829 --> 00:15:11.839 align:start position:0%
as we see we have a number in statute
 
00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
already of days and i think this would
 
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
be just another one that would go in
 
00:15:17.509 --> 00:15:17.519 align:start position:0%
there and i'm not sure
 
00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
whether it be once it's in celebrated
 
00:15:23.509 --> 00:15:23.519 align:start position:0%
continually or if it's better to be done
 
00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
on the national day and have the
 
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
governor proclaim has a better option
 
00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:28.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:15:32.389 --> 00:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
well so was martin luther king day
 
00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:34.160 align:start position:0%
national but we didn't hesitate to make
 
00:15:37.269 --> 00:15:37.279 align:start position:0%
it a state uh holiday either so
 
00:15:39.269 --> 00:15:39.279 align:start position:0%
look i wish this bill weren't here all
 
00:15:41.829 --> 00:15:41.839 align:start position:0%
right i don't like these proclamations
 
00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:44.240 align:start position:0%
but the fact is whether this is ignored
 
00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
or not ignored it's too it's just too
 
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
important to
 
00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
let principle override this even if it's
 
00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:53.030 align:start position:0%
let principle override this even if it's
ignored

00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
ignored
 
00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
so i'm all for the itl but i'm not going
 
00:15:57.829 --> 00:15:57.839 align:start position:0%
to vote for it i'm going to vote for
 
00:15:57.839 --> 00:15:59.110 align:start position:0%
to vote for it i'm going to vote for
this

00:15:59.110 --> 00:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
as i said i wish it weren't here i have
 
00:16:03.509 --> 00:16:03.519 align:start position:0%
no personal experience although i find
 
00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:05.680 align:start position:0%
my from my family tree that i would have
 
00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
been jewish enough for hitler uh
 
00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
fortunately nobody they were all
 
00:16:14.389 --> 00:16:14.399 align:start position:0%
well the left came over here to get jobs
 
00:16:15.509 --> 00:16:15.519 align:start position:0%
i guess
 
00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
anyway um
 
00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:18.230 align:start position:0%
anyway um
so

00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:18.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:16:20.949 --> 00:16:20.959 align:start position:0%
uh look in addition to being a state
 
00:16:22.949 --> 00:16:22.959 align:start position:0%
representative i
 
00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
every night i go to bed i read
 
00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519 align:start position:0%
right wing magazine it's pretty
 
00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:29.680 align:start position:0%
responsible national review and i'm
 
00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:32.920 align:start position:0%
distraught at where this where the world
 
00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
totalitarianism oppression it just seems
 
00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
to be every nation
 
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
people are
 
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
thirst for power we even saw it here
 
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:50.240 align:start position:0%
too much philosophy i'm done thank you
 
00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:52.320 align:start position:0%

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:01.910 align:start position:0%
although i do so regretfully
i

00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:17:03.829 --> 00:17:03.839 align:start position:0%
have to cite what i always cite i'm
 
00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
obligated to cite that we have 65 000
 
00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:07.189 align:start position:0%
obligated to cite that we have 65 000
pages

00:17:07.189 --> 00:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
pages
 
00:17:09.669 --> 00:17:09.679 align:start position:0%
of rsas over there on the shelf
 
00:17:09.679 --> 00:17:10.630 align:start position:0%
of rsas over there on the shelf
and

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:10.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
to be passing legislation for this sort
 
00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:14.240 align:start position:0%
of thing is difficult
 
00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:16.150 align:start position:0%
of thing is difficult
especially

00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:16.160 align:start position:0%
especially
 
00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:17.189 align:start position:0%
especially
since

00:17:17.189 --> 00:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
since
 
00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
i've spoken to so many people
 
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
like representatives uh yakubovich and
 
00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:28.720 align:start position:0%
lived behind the iron curtain
 
00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
and many who
 
00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:33.440 align:start position:0%
were senior and remember very well the
 
00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:34.789 align:start position:0%
were senior and remember very well the
goings-on

00:17:34.789 --> 00:17:34.799 align:start position:0%
goings-on
 
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:36.720 align:start position:0%
they tell me what i already knew and
 
00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
that's why i do this regretfully support
 
00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
the itl
 
00:17:42.549 --> 00:17:42.559 align:start position:0%
they tell me what i already know and
 
00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
that is that at this particular time the
 
00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
united states is in the midst of a
 
00:17:49.669 --> 00:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
communist insurgency
 
00:17:49.679 --> 00:17:51.190 align:start position:0%
communist insurgency
and

00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:52.549 align:start position:0%
and
so

00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:17:54.549 --> 00:17:54.559 align:start position:0%
we need to be vigilant we need to
 
00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
recognize it
 
00:17:58.549 --> 00:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
but another memorial day i don't think
 
00:18:02.549 --> 00:18:02.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:02.559 --> 00:18:04.230 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:04.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:05.990 align:start position:0%
representative

00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
schuett
 
00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:18:11.909 --> 00:18:11.919 align:start position:0%
as someone of polish heritage
 
00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
and i think we're all aware that the
 
00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:15.440 align:start position:0%
polls suffered
 
00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
greatly under both nazism and
 
00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:20.480 align:start position:0%
joseph stalin
 
00:18:23.909 --> 00:18:23.919 align:start position:0%
i regretfully will vote itl on this bill
 
00:18:27.029 --> 00:18:27.039 align:start position:0%
with a word to the sponsors that this
 
00:18:29.909 --> 00:18:29.919 align:start position:0%
committee usually recommends that you
 
00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
actually are going to gain more public
 
00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:33.909 align:start position:0%
actually are going to gain more public
recognition

00:18:33.909 --> 00:18:33.919 align:start position:0%
recognition
 
00:18:36.549 --> 00:18:36.559 align:start position:0%
of this issue by going to the governor
 
00:18:39.669 --> 00:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
and having him do a press conference
 
00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
the first splash when something like
 
00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
this gets put into the rsa
 
00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
yes it gets noticed but after a few
 
00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
years it's just sitting there in statute
 
00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
and it's up to people whether or not
 
00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
they pay attention to the date
 
00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
so i would urge you to please approach
 
00:18:57.430 --> 00:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
the governor
 
00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
and ask him to make this proclamation
 
00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:01.110 align:start position:0%
and ask him to make this proclamation
yearly

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
yearly
 
00:19:03.669 --> 00:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
on a personal basis and i think he would
 
00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
thank you and i would have to agree that
 
00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
probably most of the committee would be
 
00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
delighted to sign such a request
 
00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:14.720 align:start position:0%
representative fellows thank you
 
00:19:17.909 --> 00:19:17.919 align:start position:0%
like so many people on this committee
 
00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
i'm going to vote ito
 
00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
i think this is a very important subject
 
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
and i would like
 
00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:27.200 align:start position:0%
ways for people
 
00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
the public to learn more about what
 
00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
happened the people who have first-hand
 
00:19:35.669 --> 00:19:35.679 align:start position:0%
experience are have mostly passed away
 
00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:38.390 align:start position:0%
at this point
but

00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
just having a proclamation day is not
 
00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:43.360 align:start position:0%
going to make people more informed about
 
00:19:45.909 --> 00:19:45.919 align:start position:0%
this issue it's more important that
 
00:19:50.789 --> 00:19:50.799 align:start position:0%
there be things like pbs shows and
 
00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
they teach more about it in school
 
00:19:55.669 --> 00:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
and there are just other avenues that
 
00:19:57.909 --> 00:19:57.919 align:start position:0%
would inform people at a proclamation
 
00:20:00.789 --> 00:20:00.799 align:start position:0%
they really won't help much thank you
 
00:20:00.799 --> 00:20:01.830 align:start position:0%
they really won't help much thank you
okay

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
actually i will mention that one of the
 
00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors representative campbell's
 
00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:08.240 align:start position:0%
came to this country from cuba as an
 
00:20:12.149 --> 00:20:12.159 align:start position:0%
adult so he he understands the the issue
 
00:20:13.909 --> 00:20:13.919 align:start position:0%
representative bailey
 
00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
i'm going to oppose the itl because i
 
00:20:18.549 --> 00:20:18.559 align:start position:0%
realize that we have a principle here of
 
00:20:18.559 --> 00:20:19.590 align:start position:0%
realize that we have a principle here of
not

00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
keeping this sort of thing going but we
 
00:20:23.909 --> 00:20:23.919 align:start position:0%
have made exceptions
 
00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
and this hundreds of millions of dead
 
00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
strikes me as something to make an
 
00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
exception about
 
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:32.230 align:start position:0%
thank you
hey

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:32.240 align:start position:0%
hey
 
00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:34.720 align:start position:0%
anyone else representative site for a
 
00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
second time
 
00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
we don't need personal experience to
 
00:20:41.669 --> 00:20:41.679 align:start position:0%
know this horror
 
00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:43.919 align:start position:0%
that's irrelevant i mean it's relevant
 
00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
to that individual but these 100 million
 
00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
people that died i don't need
 
00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
i've i'm done
 
00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:58.070 --> 00:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
well as one of the older or perhaps the
 
00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
oldest member of the committee and
 
00:21:05.909 --> 00:21:05.919 align:start position:0%
somebody who lived in europe for
 
00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
five and a half years back in the
 
00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
sixties i was present for
 
00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:13.120 align:start position:0%
having to be out of the uh out of the
 
00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
the country of germany
 
00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
uh where i was living at the time at
 
00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
that par at the particular moment when
 
00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
the berlin wall
 
00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
was was commenced
 
00:21:26.549 --> 00:21:26.559 align:start position:0%
there wasn't a wall initially they
 
00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
strung barbed wire along certain streets
 
00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
blocked people from looking out or
 
00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:34.720 align:start position:0%
climbing out the windows of their
 
00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:36.470 align:start position:0%
climbing out the windows of their
apartments

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
apartments
 
00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:40.400 align:start position:0%
which were technically in east berlin
 
00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
where the sidewalk
 
00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
below them was in west berlin um
 
00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
and initially it was a horror story in
 
00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
many ways
 
00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:49.909 align:start position:0%
many ways
um

00:21:49.909 --> 00:21:49.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
but but i uh so i i
 
00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
lived through the
 
00:21:58.549 --> 00:21:58.559 align:start position:0%
the that period in germany when uh when
 
00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
some of the most evil aspects
 
00:22:02.549 --> 00:22:02.559 align:start position:0%
of um
 
00:22:04.789 --> 00:22:04.799 align:start position:0%
totalitarian regimes of the of the
 
00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:11.360 align:start position:0%
practicing their horrors
 
00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:12.710 align:start position:0%
practicing their horrors
but

00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:22:15.029 --> 00:22:15.039 align:start position:0%
i am concerned about
 
00:22:16.789 --> 00:22:16.799 align:start position:0%
especially the
 
00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
call for action beginning on line 21
 
00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
and especially you look at lines 22 23
 
00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:27.190 align:start position:0%
and especially you look at lines 22 23
24

00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:27.200 align:start position:0%
24
 
00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:27.990 align:start position:0%
24
which

00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
urged cities towns school administrative
 
00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
unit school districts as well as state
 
00:22:36.149 --> 00:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
colleges state colleges and universities
 
00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
throughout the state to observe the day
 
00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
in an appropriate manner including but
 
00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
not limited to education on topics
 
00:22:46.149 --> 00:22:46.159 align:start position:0%
such as mao tsatung in china and so
 
00:22:46.159 --> 00:22:47.830 align:start position:0%
such as mao tsatung in china and so
forth

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
forth
 
00:22:49.909 --> 00:22:49.919 align:start position:0%
so if we're prescribing a course of
 
00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:52.720 align:start position:0%
action above and beyond a proclamation
 
00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a program of
 
00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:56.789 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a program of
education

00:22:56.789 --> 00:22:56.799 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:22:58.870 --> 00:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
on these topics
 
00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
that's a pretty significant undertaking
 
00:23:04.149 --> 00:23:04.159 align:start position:0%
especially for younger children
 
00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:07.280 align:start position:0%
who will have utterly no idea what what
 
00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
they're being presented with to begin
 
00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:11.029 align:start position:0%
they're being presented with to begin
with

00:23:11.029 --> 00:23:11.039 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
and the implementation of this uh you
 
00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
know would have to be very skillful so
 
00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
that we don't
 
00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
merely engage in indoctrination with
 
00:23:22.549 --> 00:23:22.559 align:start position:0%
regard to the evils of communism
 
00:23:22.559 --> 00:23:23.350 align:start position:0%
regard to the evils of communism
when

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
perhaps a more appropriate topic would
 
00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:26.470 align:start position:0%
perhaps a more appropriate topic would
be

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
civil rights abuses that occur under all
 
00:23:31.029 --> 00:23:31.039 align:start position:0%
kinds of governments
 
00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
in some instances even our own in the
 
00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.789 align:start position:0%
in some instances even our own in the
past

00:23:34.789 --> 00:23:34.799 align:start position:0%
past
 
00:23:38.789 --> 00:23:38.799 align:start position:0%
and so i think this is an invitation to
 
00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
um either
 
00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:42.950 align:start position:0%
um either
sloppy

00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
observation of something or
 
00:23:47.909 --> 00:23:47.919 align:start position:0%
indoctrination which we would not be
 
00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
happy with
 
00:23:51.269 --> 00:23:51.279 align:start position:0%
so i will support the
 
00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
itl motion as well with
 
00:23:54.549 --> 00:23:54.559 align:start position:0%
with uh
 
00:23:57.269 --> 00:23:57.279 align:start position:0%
with also with recognition of what a
 
00:23:59.029 --> 00:23:59.039 align:start position:0%
number of my colleagues have said about
 
00:23:59.039 --> 00:23:59.830 align:start position:0%
number of my colleagues have said about
this

00:23:59.830 --> 00:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
represent representative
 
00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh if i remember
 
00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
correctly the cases where we made
 
00:24:09.669 --> 00:24:09.679 align:start position:0%
exceptions have been for
 
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
one-time events um i think we had a
 
00:24:13.909 --> 00:24:13.919 align:start position:0%
couple of them
 
00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
not for
 
00:24:17.909 --> 00:24:17.919 align:start position:0%
regular ones that just happen every year
 
00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:20.240 align:start position:0%
for example we had the one on the
 
00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:22.630 align:start position:0%
for example we had the one on the
upcoming

00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:22.640 align:start position:0%
upcoming
 
00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
solar eclipse here and that was at least
 
00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
part had a financial
 
00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
component to try and promote tourism to
 
00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
the state when that happens but thank
 
00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:32.950 align:start position:0%
the state when that happens but thank
you

00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
representative scitec for a third time
 
00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt you're exactly
 
00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
right on and if i thought this bill was
 
00:24:45.029 --> 00:24:45.039 align:start position:0%
going anywhere i would amend it out and
 
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
try to make this a one-time celebration
 
00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
but i don't think it's worth the effort
 
00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:50.720 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
00:24:52.149 --> 00:24:52.159 align:start position:0%
i agree
 
00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
one time the the
 
00:24:55.909 --> 00:24:55.919 align:start position:0%
the eclipse yes representative schmidt
 
00:24:58.470 --> 00:24:58.480 align:start position:0%
the eclipse situation was one where
 
00:25:00.549 --> 00:25:00.559 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to be prepared for
 
00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
potentially thousands of people coming
 
00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:05.440 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire not merely to observe
 
00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:08.320 align:start position:0%
but also to get in and out
 
00:25:11.029 --> 00:25:11.039 align:start position:0%
safely and without encumbering the
 
00:25:13.669 --> 00:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
entire northern part of the state
 
00:25:16.549 --> 00:25:16.559 align:start position:0%
so i agree one one time aspect is an
 
00:25:20.789 --> 00:25:20.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:23.029 --> 00:25:23.039 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm more concerned with the
 
00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
fact that
 
00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
the two people who spoke had different
 
00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
ideas on what we should do with the
 
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.269 align:start position:0%
ideas on what we should do with the
spill

00:25:29.269 --> 00:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
spill
 
00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
i mean victims of communism
 
00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
is different from victims of oppression
 
00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:35.590 align:start position:0%
is different from victims of oppression
and

00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
changing the date just doesn't seem to
 
00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
be the right thing to do
 
00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
in any anyone else
 
00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:46.480 align:start position:0%
all right seeing no other comments the
 
00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
motion is inexpedient to legislate on
 
00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:51.520 align:start position:0%

yes
 
00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:05.200 align:start position:0%
i don't think this belongs on consent
 
00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:11.360 align:start position:0%
even if there were only one i think it
 
00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:13.350 align:start position:0%
even if there were only one i think it
is

00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:13.360 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
something of of note
 
00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:18.640 align:start position:0%
the vote is 12 to 5.
 
00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
the vote is 12 to 5 so the motion passes
 
00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:24.640 align:start position:0%
this will be on the regular calendar
 
00:27:25.909 --> 00:27:25.919 align:start position:0%
is someone going to be writing a
 
00:27:28.149 --> 00:27:28.159 align:start position:0%
minority report
 
00:27:30.149 --> 00:27:30.159 align:start position:0%
yup representative you can't write a
 
00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:32.240 align:start position:0%
minority report represented allegro you
 
00:27:42.789 --> 00:27:42.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:44.149 --> 00:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
and therefore he's
 
00:27:46.549 --> 00:27:46.559 align:start position:0%
he's writing the majority report is
 
00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
somebody writing a minority report
 
00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:52.720 align:start position:0%

did you have a second madam chair
 
00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
i'd like to speak to your motion

00:29:30.149 --> 00:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
keeps the
 
00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
the the theory and function of the
 
00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
pension system going
 
00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
is a balance of investment returns and
 
00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:38.950 align:start position:0%
is a balance of investment returns and
income

00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
income
 
00:29:41.029 --> 00:29:41.039 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that has become
 
00:29:41.039 --> 00:29:44.950 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that has become
slightly

00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:46.710 align:start position:0%
 
popular

00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:46.720 align:start position:0%
popular
 
00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:48.389 align:start position:0%
popular
is

00:29:48.389 --> 00:29:48.399 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:50.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of things that are reducing the
 
00:29:54.789 --> 00:29:54.799 align:start position:0%
income stream to that system
 
00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
this particular bill and we're supposed
 
00:29:58.310 --> 00:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
to look at these as standalone but this
 
00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
does kind of tie into another one that
 
00:30:02.149 --> 00:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
we're we're also hearing
 
00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
specifically in the the issue here is
 
00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
specifically the exclusion of hours
 
00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:09.750 align:start position:0%
specifically the exclusion of hours
on

00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
what would be special duty we we've
 
00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
already have concerns over the amount of
 
00:30:15.269 --> 00:30:15.279 align:start position:0%
hours worked that retirees are doing as
 
00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:16.480 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
and to
 
00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:21.200 align:start position:0%
start breaking out subgroups of
 
00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
different types of things and not
 
00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
counting hours here and counting hours
 
00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
there makes an extraordinarily
 
00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
complicated system even more so
 
00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
focusing on
 
00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:37.679 align:start position:0%
the holistic
 
00:30:41.269 --> 00:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
inclusion of hours worked
 
00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
and not start to break them off into
 
00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:46.720 align:start position:0%
subgroups and specialties and things of
 
00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:48.640 align:start position:0%
that nature so that is that is the main
 
00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
premise of why i think this uh piece of
 
00:30:53.029 --> 00:30:53.039 align:start position:0%
legislation needs to be italed
 
00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
representative goalie do you wish to
 
00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
speak to your second
 
00:30:59.509 --> 00:30:59.519 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh yes i
 
00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:31:02.149 --> 00:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
looking at this
 
00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
like representative pearson said we've
 
00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
always looked to reduce the number of
 
00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:07.029 align:start position:0%
always looked to reduce the number of
hours

00:31:07.029 --> 00:31:07.039 align:start position:0%
hours
 
00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
well i would prefer to see a reduction
 
00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:12.320 align:start position:0%
in the hours worked i think this here
 
00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
calling on not including special duty
 
00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:17.590 align:start position:0%
calling on not including special duty
hours

00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
hours
 
00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:18.470 align:start position:0%
hours
um

00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:20.480 align:start position:0%
you see it is right in it uh special
 
00:31:22.549 --> 00:31:22.559 align:start position:0%
duty law enforcement so they're still
 
00:31:24.389 --> 00:31:24.399 align:start position:0%
doing law enforcement whether directing
 
00:31:26.549 --> 00:31:26.559 align:start position:0%
traffic or not they're expected to carry
 
00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
out their duties um for that reason
 
00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
alone i think that those hours should be
 
00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:33.200 align:start position:0%
counted thank you
 
00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:36.870 align:start position:0%
counted thank you
representative

00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:38.230 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:38.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
you may not have i'm not sure how many
 
00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
heard but representative emerick when he
 
00:31:44.789 --> 00:31:44.799 align:start position:0%
was introducing this said almost under
 
00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
his breath if these special duty hours
 
00:31:52.149 --> 00:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
do not earn money towards retirement
 
00:31:54.149 --> 00:31:54.159 align:start position:0%
why should they be counted against you
 
00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:56.240 align:start position:0%
after retirement source for the goose is
 
00:31:58.149 --> 00:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
sourced for the gander
 
00:31:59.830 --> 00:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
i'd like to enlarge this for a second
 
00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
because i've been thinking a lot about
 
00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind uh i'll try to make
 
00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:05.200 align:start position:0%
this fast
 
00:32:07.269 --> 00:32:07.279 align:start position:0%
we have 12 minutes i'll try to keep it
 
00:32:10.149 --> 00:32:10.159 align:start position:0%
to 11. the
 
00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
we wonder about these people working
 
00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:14.710 align:start position:0%
we wonder about these people working
part-time

00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:14.720 align:start position:0%
part-time
 
00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
when they could have full-time officers
 
00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
paying down the uaal how about something
 
00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:20.640 align:start position:0%
like this
 
00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
you say to somebody who's working
 
00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:23.590 align:start position:0%
you say to somebody who's working
part-time

00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
part-time
 
00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
you want to work part-time for this town
 
00:32:28.389 --> 00:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
hold the retirement system harmless
 
00:32:31.269 --> 00:32:31.279 align:start position:0%
you contribute towards the uaal
 
00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
we can't charge you an employment fee
 
00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
but you can hold the retirement system
 
00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
harmless as it would have been held
 
00:32:40.630 --> 00:32:40.640 align:start position:0%
harmless if they had gotten a regular
 
00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
officer so take your pick you don't have
 
00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
to worry
 
00:32:45.509 --> 00:32:45.519 align:start position:0%
that's a thought i'm not going to man
 
00:32:47.909 --> 00:32:47.919 align:start position:0%
the ramparts but if anybody if it grows
 
00:32:51.509 --> 00:32:51.519 align:start position:0%
any legs i'd be happy to work with it
 
00:32:55.029 --> 00:32:55.039 align:start position:0%
thank you representative rhodes
 
00:32:57.669 --> 00:32:57.679 align:start position:0%
madam chair i i would respect that um
 
00:32:59.509 --> 00:32:59.519 align:start position:0%
representative pearson seems to have a
 
00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:01.120 align:start position:0%
response that seems pretty important so
 
00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
i would yield and re go after him
 
00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:08.640 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um with reference
 
00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:09.509 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um with reference
to

00:33:09.509 --> 00:33:09.519 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:33:11.909 --> 00:33:11.919 align:start position:0%
representative scitec's comments
 
00:33:13.909 --> 00:33:13.919 align:start position:0%
and what i was going to say i did ask
 
00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
the question
 
00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
during the hearing
 
00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
if there were still officers who were
 
00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
able to
 
00:33:24.389 --> 00:33:24.399 align:start position:0%
work special details and have that count
 
00:33:26.789 --> 00:33:26.799 align:start position:0%
towards their retirement and the answer
 
00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
was yes approximately eighteen hundred
 
00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
so in difference to those officers who
 
00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
are able to work these special details
 
00:33:39.269 --> 00:33:39.279 align:start position:0%
and have it count towards their
 
00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
retirement i would say that's a pretty
 
00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
large number and we should i teal this
 
00:33:47.029 --> 00:33:47.039 align:start position:0%
bill for now perhaps in the future if
 
00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
the number is much smaller it's
 
00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
something to consider thank you thank
 
00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:54.640 align:start position:0%
you representative pearson
 
00:33:57.190 --> 00:33:57.200 align:start position:0%
now this is in reference to
 
00:33:59.750 --> 00:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
the the idea that representative scitec
 
00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
has brought forward there is one there
 
00:34:03.669 --> 00:34:03.679 align:start position:0%
is one problem with that in the sense
 
00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:06.720 align:start position:0%
that if you are going to charge these
 
00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:08.310 align:start position:0%
that if you are going to charge these
folks

00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
folks
 
00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:10.240 align:start position:0%
and you're going to withdraw
 
00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
monies from their
 
00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
pay to pay the pension system now you're
 
00:34:16.869 --> 00:34:16.879 align:start position:0%
starting to run into irs things you're
 
00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
starting to run into federal pension
 
00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:20.800 align:start position:0%
laws that involve the prohibition of
 
00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
that exact thing so that's though i i'm
 
00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
not opposed to the the theory and what
 
00:34:28.389 --> 00:34:28.399 align:start position:0%
you're getting at there um you just as
 
00:34:30.149 --> 00:34:30.159 align:start position:0%
of right now cannot do that if you're
 
00:34:33.349 --> 00:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
going to withdraw it's going to have to
 
00:34:35.589 --> 00:34:35.599 align:start position:0%
become part of the process
 
00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
that process being and again to remind
 
00:34:39.589 --> 00:34:39.599 align:start position:0%
the folks you know there have been
 
00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
substantial efforts made against double
 
00:34:44.470 --> 00:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
dipping into this system
 
00:34:46.950 --> 00:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
and when you start
 
00:34:49.109 --> 00:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
bringing people back in virtually
 
00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
full-time roles you are doing exactly
 
00:34:54.470 --> 00:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
that you are permitting someone to to
 
00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
practically work full-time while also
 
00:34:58.390 --> 00:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
collecting their retirement that is not
 
00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
healthy for the system it's not how the
 
00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
system was intended to function
 
00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
and i think that the problems that the
 
00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
representative schuett made in reference
 
00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:09.440 align:start position:0%
to those that are still active and and
 
00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:11.200 align:start position:0%
able to count these
 
00:35:14.069 --> 00:35:14.079 align:start position:0%
also exacerbates that thank you
 
00:35:15.589 --> 00:35:15.599 align:start position:0%
senator rhodes
 
00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:17.200 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman
 
00:35:19.109 --> 00:35:19.119 align:start position:0%
so i i believe
 
00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:21.440 align:start position:0%
that it was representative o'brien that
 
00:35:24.069 --> 00:35:24.079 align:start position:0%
had asked the question about
 
00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
if if there was a specific reason that
 
00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
there needed to be officers that was
 
00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
doing this special duty because if
 
00:35:32.710 --> 00:35:32.720 align:start position:0%
indeed they were needed to
 
00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
do a duty then they would be the ones to
 
00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
actually be able to step up and do that
 
00:35:38.069 --> 00:35:38.079 align:start position:0%
in the event of
 
00:35:39.829 --> 00:35:39.839 align:start position:0%
you know something going wrong so that
 
00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
is one thing to consider that if if
 
00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
other people were able to do it they
 
00:35:45.589 --> 00:35:45.599 align:start position:0%
would be doing it so they are doing
 
00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
police work um
 
00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
the the other thing that i think is
 
00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
important is
 
00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:52.640 align:start position:0%
exactly what representative pearson is
 
00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
saying that
 
00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
once you retire so a lot of the reasons
 
00:35:58.390 --> 00:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
and and we did have a gentleman that
 
00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
confirmed this that one of the reasons
 
00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
people retire is when they're they're
 
00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
ready to be retired and once you are
 
00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:06.880 align:start position:0%
retired you're actually able
 
00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
to say
 
00:36:09.349 --> 00:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
no i i don't want to work these
 
00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
particular days or these particular
 
00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
hours and you're kind of excused from
 
00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:15.440 align:start position:0%
that so in the event that you start
 
00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
working you know your 1500 and some
 
00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
hours a year 25 hours a week i think it
 
00:36:23.589 --> 00:36:23.599 align:start position:0%
related to then you turn around and you
 
00:36:23.599 --> 00:36:24.390 align:start position:0%
related to then you turn around and you
work

00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:25.430 align:start position:0%
work
20

00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
20
 
00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
20 or 25 hours at this particular job
 
00:36:30.069 --> 00:36:30.079 align:start position:0%
you're essentially working more than
 
00:36:32.069 --> 00:36:32.079 align:start position:0%
what a full-time
 
00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
employee is working and perhaps they
 
00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
need to step back a little bit before
 
00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:42.560 align:start position:0%
thank you i'd i'd like to mention that
 
00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:43.589 align:start position:0%
thank you i'd i'd like to mention that
the

00:36:43.589 --> 00:36:43.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:36:46.069 --> 00:36:46.079 align:start position:0%
employee would not be paying
 
00:36:46.079 --> 00:36:47.190 align:start position:0%
employee would not be paying
the

00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:47.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:36:50.069 --> 00:36:50.079 align:start position:0%
uaal contribution that's an employer
 
00:36:50.079 --> 00:36:51.589 align:start position:0%
uaal contribution that's an employer
responsibility

00:36:51.589 --> 00:36:51.599 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:52.960 align:start position:0%
and therefore
 
00:36:57.589 --> 00:36:57.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
cost increase for the towns
 
00:37:01.589 --> 00:37:01.599 align:start position:0%
they are
 
00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:04.400 align:start position:0%
current many many towns are enjoying
 
00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:06.720 align:start position:0%
having retired police officers because
 
00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:09.440 align:start position:0%
they're cheaper than than
 
00:37:11.349 --> 00:37:11.359 align:start position:0%
working police officers because you
 
00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
don't have to pay the pension
 
00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:14.550 align:start position:0%
don't have to pay the pension
contribution

00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
contribution
 
00:37:17.109 --> 00:37:17.119 align:start position:0%
so this would make it more difficult for
 
00:37:19.349 --> 00:37:19.359 align:start position:0%
retired police to find a job if their
 
00:37:22.870 --> 00:37:22.880 align:start position:0%
employer had to pay the ual in addition
 
00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:31.280 align:start position:0%
representative scitec of the chair is
 
00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
the town wouldn't be prohibited from
 
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
paying that as an extra too
 
00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
i don't believe any town would volunteer
 
00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
to pay the ual well to keep to have an
 
00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
officer a hand
 
00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
but we would have to mandate that they
 
00:37:48.310 --> 00:37:48.320 align:start position:0%
do so
 
00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
if i may continue i do not like what
 
00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
representative schuett and pearson have
 
00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:54.640 align:start position:0%
said because they forced me to change my
 
00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:57.750 align:start position:0%
said because they forced me to change my
mind

00:37:57.750 --> 00:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:59.910 --> 00:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
it's a hazard of the job representative
 
00:38:02.230 --> 00:38:02.240 align:start position:0%
scitec is there any other comments
 
00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:04.390 align:start position:0%
scitec is there any other comments
questions

00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:04.400 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none
 
00:38:09.109 --> 00:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
the motion is an expedient to legislate
 
00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
on house bill 1549
 
00:38:14.069 --> 00:38:14.079 align:start position:0%

okay the motion passes 17 to zero
 
00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:17.200 align:start position:0%
without objection we'll put it on

without objection we'll put it on
consent

00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
all right i think that's probably all we
 
00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
can do until our next hearing
 
00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:43.829 --> 00:39:43.839 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm not hard but i aren't they
 
00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
going to die off i mean is that their
 
00:39:45.680 --> 00:45:37.990 align:start position:0%
going to die off i mean is that their

thank you madam chair
 
00:45:55.349 --> 00:45:55.359 align:start position:0%
representative pamonti is unable to be
 
00:45:57.109 --> 00:45:57.119 align:start position:0%
with us this morning
 
00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
has a conflict but he asked me to open
 
00:46:02.550 --> 00:46:02.560 align:start position:0%
the bill for him which i'm happy to do
 
00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
i won't take any testimony i i am on the
 
00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
assessing standards board as
 
00:46:11.109 --> 00:46:11.119 align:start position:0%
some of you in the committee know
 
00:46:15.829 --> 00:46:15.839 align:start position:0%
now for uh i don't know 15 or 16 years
 
00:46:18.870 --> 00:46:18.880 align:start position:0%
i don't profess to any
 
00:46:21.190 --> 00:46:21.200 align:start position:0%
any specific expertise in the field but
 
00:46:23.589 --> 00:46:23.599 align:start position:0%
i have listened and learned a lot in my
 
00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
time on the committee and i am fully in
 
00:46:27.829 --> 00:46:27.839 align:start position:0%
support of this bill
 
00:46:31.109 --> 00:46:31.119 align:start position:0%
because it it goes to an issue that will
 
00:46:34.150 --> 00:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
be discussed by the the numerous experts
 
00:46:35.829 --> 00:46:35.839 align:start position:0%
who are here from the assessing
 
00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
standards board president passed
 
00:46:42.470 --> 00:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
and so i hope the committee will ask
 
00:46:44.550 --> 00:46:44.560 align:start position:0%
their questions when when any one of
 
00:46:46.630 --> 00:46:46.640 align:start position:0%
them are testifying they know what
 
00:46:48.230 --> 00:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
they're talking about so thank you very
 
00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:50.390 align:start position:0%
they're talking about so thank you very
much

00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:50.400 align:start position:0%

the chairman betsy patton i believe
 
00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:11.680 align:start position:0%

[Music]

00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:47:17.589 --> 00:47:17.599 align:start position:0%
the uh the impetus for for for this bill
 
00:47:19.990 --> 00:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
was that um
 
00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
the transparency
 
00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
of assessing certification
 
00:47:27.589 --> 00:47:27.599 align:start position:0%
and discipline and decertification
 
00:47:29.270 --> 00:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
is not where the assessing standards
 
00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
board wanted it to be the intent when we
 
00:47:34.069 --> 00:47:34.079 align:start position:0%
put rules in place excuse me sir you
 
00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:36.640 align:start position:0%
have to be closer to the microphone
 
00:47:37.589 --> 00:47:37.599 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:47:39.510 --> 00:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
the the intent when we put the rules in
 
00:47:41.589 --> 00:47:41.599 align:start position:0%
place was to have this process be
 
00:47:41.599 --> 00:47:43.109 align:start position:0%
place was to have this process be
transparent

00:47:43.109 --> 00:47:43.119 align:start position:0%
transparent
 
00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
um for taxpayers for the regulating
 
00:47:47.270 --> 00:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
bodies and so forth
 
00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
and it turns out that because uh the
 
00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
department of revenue has a
 
00:47:55.270 --> 00:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
non-disclosure or
 
00:47:57.430 --> 00:47:57.440 align:start position:0%
non-disclosure statute they have
 
00:47:59.030 --> 00:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
interpreted that to mean that the
 
00:48:02.549 --> 00:48:02.559 align:start position:0%
entirety of the assessing certification
 
00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
and discipline decertification is
 
00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
confidential and can't be released to
 
00:48:08.309 --> 00:48:08.319 align:start position:0%
the public
 
00:48:10.309 --> 00:48:10.319 align:start position:0%
this is not the intent of the asb when
 
00:48:12.069 --> 00:48:12.079 align:start position:0%
we set the rules up
 
00:48:14.309 --> 00:48:14.319 align:start position:0%
and we're taking this avenue to make
 
00:48:18.790 --> 00:48:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
thank you we appreciate that is there
 
00:48:22.790 --> 00:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
00:48:24.390 --> 00:48:24.400 align:start position:0%
representative schuett
 
00:48:25.990 --> 00:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you mr
 
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.069 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you mr
gangney

00:48:28.069 --> 00:48:28.079 align:start position:0%
gangney
 
00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
is there some reason that this could not
 
00:48:32.069 --> 00:48:32.079 align:start position:0%
be accomplished
 
00:48:35.349 --> 00:48:35.359 align:start position:0%
by somehow changing statute to allow
 
00:48:39.829 --> 00:48:39.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:39.839 --> 00:48:41.430 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:48:41.430 --> 00:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
the assessing standards board
 
00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:45.599 align:start position:0%
was set up to
 
00:48:47.910 --> 00:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
put standards and rules in place for
 
00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:49.510 align:start position:0%
put standards and rules in place for
assessing

00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
assessing
 
00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
but it was never an intention that the
 
00:48:53.910 --> 00:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
assessing standards would be the
 
00:48:56.309 --> 00:48:56.319 align:start position:0%
policing agency initially that was the
 
00:48:57.910 --> 00:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
department of revenue
 
00:48:57.920 --> 00:48:59.270 align:start position:0%
department of revenue
and

00:48:59.270 --> 00:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:49:01.750 --> 00:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
that had been working fairly well
 
00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
since its inception in the early aughts
 
00:49:05.349 --> 00:49:05.359 align:start position:0%
you know 2001 or two
 
00:49:06.870 --> 00:49:06.880 align:start position:0%
but some issues have come up in the last
 
00:49:08.390 --> 00:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
couple of years
 
00:49:10.950 --> 00:49:10.960 align:start position:0%
on that transparency issue
 
00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
and and we felt this was a necessary
 
00:49:15.430 --> 00:49:15.440 align:start position:0%
step i can tell you that there have been
 
00:49:17.510 --> 00:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
members of the public who have felt that
 
00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:18.720 align:start position:0%
it should have been
 
00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
an independent
 
00:49:22.069 --> 00:49:22.079 align:start position:0%
licensing and service certification
 
00:49:24.069 --> 00:49:24.079 align:start position:0%
board since the beginning
 
00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
uh kind of like the new hampshire real
 
00:49:28.069 --> 00:49:28.079 align:start position:0%
estate appraiser board of which i'm a
 
00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
certified individual
 
00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:32.069 align:start position:0%
certified individual
we

00:49:32.069 --> 00:49:32.079 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:49:34.630 --> 00:49:34.640 align:start position:0%
initially thought that was
 
00:49:36.630 --> 00:49:36.640 align:start position:0%
maybe too big a step and that that
 
00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
between the assessing standards board
 
00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:40.160 align:start position:0%
and the department of revenue that this
 
00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
could be handled properly and
 
00:49:44.230 --> 00:49:44.240 align:start position:0%
we don't know that that's the case
 
00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:46.790 align:start position:0%
we don't know that that's the case
anymore

00:49:46.790 --> 00:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
representative blackis
 
00:49:52.150 --> 00:49:52.160 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
rather than setting up a whole separate
 
00:49:56.549 --> 00:49:56.559 align:start position:0%
board to deal with this is there
 
00:49:58.870 --> 00:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
other problems with dra doing it other
 
00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:00.880 align:start position:0%
than transparency because there you know
 
00:50:03.510 --> 00:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
there could be statute change to make uh
 
00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
that part of what they do you know have
 
00:50:07.430 --> 00:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
to be transparent right right and and to
 
00:50:10.309 --> 00:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
be honest we've got another track where
 
00:50:10.319 --> 00:50:11.190 align:start position:0%
be honest we've got another track where
we've

00:50:11.190 --> 00:50:11.200 align:start position:0%
we've
 
00:50:13.190 --> 00:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
proposed adding
 
00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
some exceptions to the confidentiality
 
00:50:17.829 --> 00:50:17.839 align:start position:0%
statute that they're subject to to open
 
00:50:19.829 --> 00:50:19.839 align:start position:0%
up those records
 
00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
but there may be some additional issues
 
00:50:24.069 --> 00:50:24.079 align:start position:0%
that others will will address
 
00:50:26.309 --> 00:50:26.319 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that um and and i don't
 
00:50:27.670 --> 00:50:27.680 align:start position:0%
know if the department is here to speak
 
00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:28.790 align:start position:0%
know if the department is here to speak
today

00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:50:30.069 --> 00:50:30.079 align:start position:0%
but the uh
 
00:50:31.670 --> 00:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
00:50:33.670 --> 00:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
you know there's there's been quite a
 
00:50:36.069 --> 00:50:36.079 align:start position:0%
bit of activity in the last few years on
 
00:50:38.309 --> 00:50:38.319 align:start position:0%
uh complaints and so forth
 
00:50:38.319 --> 00:50:39.109 align:start position:0%
uh complaints and so forth
and

00:50:39.109 --> 00:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:50:41.190 --> 00:50:41.200 align:start position:0%
and this is my opinion by the way
 
00:50:43.589 --> 00:50:43.599 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that the um
 
00:50:43.599 --> 00:50:44.470 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that the um
uh

00:50:44.470 --> 00:50:44.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:46.720 align:start position:0%
the hearings bureau that they have set
 
00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
up was really set up for this kind of
 
00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:49.589 align:start position:0%
up was really set up for this kind of
thing

00:50:49.589 --> 00:50:49.599 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:50:51.349 --> 00:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
i think it was more set up for for
 
00:50:54.230 --> 00:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
issues of taxation and appeals of
 
00:50:56.150 --> 00:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
taxation whether it's rooms and meals or
 
00:50:57.670 --> 00:50:57.680 align:start position:0%
business tax
 
00:50:59.270 --> 00:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's not that large a
 
00:51:03.990 --> 00:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
staff where the oplc i as i understand
 
00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:06.880 align:start position:0%
it is a staff of over a hundred and this
 
00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
is their job is to administer
 
00:51:11.589 --> 00:51:11.599 align:start position:0%
i believe about 54 boards and
 
00:51:11.599 --> 00:51:12.950 align:start position:0%
i believe about 54 boards and
commissions

00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
commissions
 
00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:13.750 align:start position:0%
commissions
um

00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
i can tell you as a real estate
 
00:51:16.630 --> 00:51:16.640 align:start position:0%
appraiser i think they've done a you
 
00:51:18.309 --> 00:51:18.319 align:start position:0%
know it's been a process that's worked
 
00:51:19.510 --> 00:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
pretty well
 
00:51:21.430 --> 00:51:21.440 align:start position:0%
and i'm confident that that
 
00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
it would be a good setup to create this
 
00:51:25.750 --> 00:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
assessing certification board under the
 
00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:27.190 align:start position:0%
assessing certification board under the
oplc

00:51:27.190 --> 00:51:27.200 align:start position:0%
oplc
 
00:51:28.630 --> 00:51:28.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:51:30.870 --> 00:51:30.880 align:start position:0%
representative scitec
 
00:51:33.430 --> 00:51:33.440 align:start position:0%
other boards as have as part of their
 
00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:34.950 align:start position:0%
other boards as have as part of their
function

00:51:34.950 --> 00:51:34.960 align:start position:0%
function
 
00:51:37.990 --> 00:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
discipline uh how you said that you only
 
00:51:40.710 --> 00:51:40.720 align:start position:0%
do standards and testing why not
 
00:51:43.270 --> 00:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
incorporate why not expand your uh
 
00:51:44.470 --> 00:51:44.480 align:start position:0%
purview to
 
00:51:46.549 --> 00:51:46.559 align:start position:0%
include discipline
 
00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
yeah we we do have disciplinary rules
 
00:51:51.589 --> 00:51:51.599 align:start position:0%
and this department of revenue that that
 
00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
enforces that not the assessing we set
 
00:51:56.309 --> 00:51:56.319 align:start position:0%
the standards and and the disciplinary
 
00:51:56.319 --> 00:51:57.349 align:start position:0%
the standards and and the disciplinary
rules

00:51:57.349 --> 00:51:57.359 align:start position:0%
rules
 
00:51:59.030 --> 00:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
and the department of revenue polices
 
00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:01.829 align:start position:0%
and the department of revenue polices
that

00:52:01.829 --> 00:52:01.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:03.829 --> 00:52:03.839 align:start position:0%
thank you we're
 
00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:08.549 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
um

00:52:08.549 --> 00:52:08.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:10.630 --> 00:52:10.640 align:start position:0%
can you just tell me
 
00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:11.750 align:start position:0%
can you just tell me
why

00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:52:14.309 --> 00:52:14.319 align:start position:0%
if you think that the office of
 
00:52:16.630 --> 00:52:16.640 align:start position:0%
professional licensing and certification
 
00:52:18.390 --> 00:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
has staff
 
00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
that can
 
00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
make decisions about
 
00:52:26.069 --> 00:52:26.079 align:start position:0%
even if a person qualifies to be
 
00:52:29.270 --> 00:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
certified or licensed because
 
00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
within this statute
 
00:52:33.670 --> 00:52:33.680 align:start position:0%
it's very vague it's not like
 
00:52:35.910 --> 00:52:35.920 align:start position:0%
they graduated with some kind of degree
 
00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
or they you know
 
00:52:40.790 --> 00:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
certified by some you know assessing
 
00:52:42.309 --> 00:52:42.319 align:start position:0%
national assessing
 
00:52:44.230 --> 00:52:44.240 align:start position:0%
assessors standards borders something
 
00:52:47.190 --> 00:52:47.200 align:start position:0%
like that so how would that even work
 
00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:48.240 align:start position:0%
so we
 
00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
the proposal in front of you was based
 
00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:51.270 align:start position:0%
the proposal in front of you was based
on

00:52:51.270 --> 00:52:51.280 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:52:53.829 --> 00:52:53.839 align:start position:0%
the statute i believe for the most part
 
00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
for the new hampshire real estate
 
00:52:57.750 --> 00:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
appraiser board it mirrors that
 
00:52:59.349 --> 00:52:59.359 align:start position:0%
so this sets up the framework and then
 
00:53:01.349 --> 00:53:01.359 align:start position:0%
rules have to be set about who qualifies
 
00:53:02.710 --> 00:53:02.720 align:start position:0%
and how
 
00:53:06.069 --> 00:53:06.079 align:start position:0%
and while the oplc will administer that
 
00:53:08.790 --> 00:53:08.800 align:start position:0%
the assessing certification board will
 
00:53:10.309 --> 00:53:10.319 align:start position:0%
oversee that for example if there's a
 
00:53:12.630 --> 00:53:12.640 align:start position:0%
complaint against an assessor
 
00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
the oplc would
 
00:53:16.390 --> 00:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
take that complaint in determine if it's
 
00:53:18.790 --> 00:53:18.800 align:start position:0%
founded do the research determine if it
 
00:53:21.190 --> 00:53:21.200 align:start position:0%
needed to be prosecuted
 
00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
and they would conduct that function but
 
00:53:26.069 --> 00:53:26.079 align:start position:0%
the assessing certification board
 
00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
would hear the case and make a decision
 
00:53:31.510 --> 00:53:31.520 align:start position:0%
yes representative fellows this sets up
 
00:53:33.990 --> 00:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
a complete professional board with
 
00:53:37.030 --> 00:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
disciplinary with with certification
 
00:53:40.230 --> 00:53:40.240 align:start position:0%
powers approval of continuing education
 
00:53:42.549 --> 00:53:42.559 align:start position:0%
and discipline of the licensees the old
 
00:53:49.510 --> 00:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:52.390 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:53:52.390 --> 00:53:52.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:53:55.190 --> 00:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so
 
00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
my understanding
 
00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:00.480 align:start position:0%
of this bill is that you wish to
 
00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:09.510 align:start position:0%
 
existing

00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
existing
 
00:54:12.870 --> 00:54:12.880 align:start position:0%
requirements for assessors are not being
 
00:54:15.190 --> 00:54:15.200 align:start position:0%
upheld what is the the root of the
 
00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
problem in you know in english okay
 
00:54:21.750 --> 00:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
so right now if an assessor
 
00:54:23.829 --> 00:54:23.839 align:start position:0%
has a complaint against them and it's
 
00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
determined to be founded meaning it's a
 
00:54:27.750 --> 00:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
legitimate complaint
 
00:54:30.549 --> 00:54:30.559 align:start position:0%
and discipline occurs
 
00:54:32.390 --> 00:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
no one knows about that
 
00:54:34.309 --> 00:54:34.319 align:start position:0%
it's it's not that information is not
 
00:54:36.470 --> 00:54:36.480 align:start position:0%
available to the public
 
00:54:37.910 --> 00:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
that's a problem because the public
 
00:54:39.670 --> 00:54:39.680 align:start position:0%
should be aware of
 
00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:42.400 align:start position:0%
whether someone's got an issue with with
 
00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:43.589 align:start position:0%
whether someone's got an issue with with
assessing

00:54:43.589 --> 00:54:43.599 align:start position:0%
assessing
 
00:54:43.599 --> 00:54:44.710 align:start position:0%
assessing
um

00:54:44.710 --> 00:54:44.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:46.870 --> 00:54:46.880 align:start position:0%
as a as an assessor
 
00:54:49.030 --> 00:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
i find it's an issue because
 
00:54:50.309 --> 00:54:50.319 align:start position:0%
if someone's
 
00:54:52.390 --> 00:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
conducting themselves in a fashion
 
00:54:54.150 --> 00:54:54.160 align:start position:0%
that got them in trouble it would be
 
00:54:55.589 --> 00:54:55.599 align:start position:0%
nice to know
 
00:54:57.190 --> 00:54:57.200 align:start position:0%
what you know what the result of that
 
00:54:58.950 --> 00:54:58.960 align:start position:0%
was what what the actions were that got
 
00:55:01.190 --> 00:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
them in trouble and what the result was
 
00:55:02.470 --> 00:55:02.480 align:start position:0%
so that
 
00:55:04.710 --> 00:55:04.720 align:start position:0%
you know we we make make we're more
 
00:55:06.630 --> 00:55:06.640 align:start position:0%
careful about how we conduct ourselves
 
00:55:08.230 --> 00:55:08.240 align:start position:0%
but if we don't know that
 
00:55:09.750 --> 00:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
you know it's possible that we step in
 
00:55:11.510 --> 00:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
the same landmine
 
00:55:13.990 --> 00:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
and and aren't aware of it so it really
 
00:55:15.829 --> 00:55:15.839 align:start position:0%
needs to be open and
 
00:55:18.150 --> 00:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
realist if a real estate appraiser has a
 
00:55:20.470 --> 00:55:20.480 align:start position:0%
complaint against them that whole
 
00:55:22.390 --> 00:55:22.400 align:start position:0%
process is open you can go onto the new
 
00:55:23.910 --> 00:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire real estate appraisal board
 
00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:24.950 align:start position:0%
hampshire real estate appraisal board
site

00:55:24.950 --> 00:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
site
 
00:55:26.470 --> 00:55:26.480 align:start position:0%
and look anybody up to find out if
 
00:55:27.990 --> 00:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
they've ever had any discipline going
 
00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:29.030 align:start position:0%
they've ever had any discipline going
back

00:55:29.030 --> 00:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:55:31.589 --> 00:55:31.599 align:start position:0%
30 years and it's all public
 
00:55:33.589 --> 00:55:33.599 align:start position:0%
and that's how this should be as well
 
00:55:34.630 --> 00:55:34.640 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:55:36.630 --> 00:55:36.640 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:44.069 --> 00:55:44.079 align:start position:0%
okay let me let me back up is if a town
 
00:55:47.109 --> 00:55:47.119 align:start position:0%
hires an a uncertified assessor is that

against the law
 
00:55:50.630 --> 00:55:50.640 align:start position:0%
depends on what they're hiring them to
 
00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:52.710 align:start position:0%
depends on what they're hiring them to
do

00:55:52.710 --> 00:55:52.720 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:53.510 align:start position:0%
do
they

00:55:53.510 --> 00:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:55:54.950 --> 00:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
you know it
 
00:55:57.750 --> 00:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
if you hire someone
 
00:56:00.069 --> 00:56:00.079 align:start position:0%
to do particular services
 
00:56:02.230 --> 00:56:02.240 align:start position:0%
they need to be certified and qualified
 
00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
to provide those services whether it's
 
00:56:05.910 --> 00:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
an employee whether it's robert gagne
 
00:56:07.829 --> 00:56:07.839 align:start position:0%
working for the city of manchester i
 
00:56:09.349 --> 00:56:09.359 align:start position:0%
need to be certified
 
00:56:11.349 --> 00:56:11.359 align:start position:0%
at the level of work i'm doing as a as
 
00:56:13.750 --> 00:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
my responsibility and it goes right down
 
00:56:15.270 --> 00:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
to someone that's visiting a property
 
00:56:17.430 --> 00:56:17.440 align:start position:0%
just to gather information whether it's
 
00:56:19.109 --> 00:56:19.119 align:start position:0%
an employee or a contractor that
 
00:56:21.349 --> 00:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
individual needs to be certified at the
 
00:56:25.190 --> 00:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:26.470 --> 00:56:26.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:56:28.470 --> 00:56:28.480 align:start position:0%
all right thank you other representative
 
00:56:31.270 --> 00:56:31.280 align:start position:0%
o'brien and then shewett
 
00:56:33.510 --> 00:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question i
 
00:56:35.750 --> 00:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
understand what you're doing here and
 
00:56:39.349 --> 00:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
i'm all about the transparency but
 
00:56:42.150 --> 00:56:42.160 align:start position:0%
i would imagine in your line of work
 
00:56:43.910 --> 00:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
that you're always going to have people
 
00:56:46.309 --> 00:56:46.319 align:start position:0%
to disagree with their particular
 
00:56:46.319 --> 00:56:47.990 align:start position:0%
to disagree with their particular
assessment

00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:48.789 align:start position:0%
assessment
so

00:56:48.789 --> 00:56:48.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:56:51.270 --> 00:56:51.280 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned about the assessor himself
 
00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:52.880 align:start position:0%
or herself
 
00:56:55.030 --> 00:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
what is the safeguard here
 
00:56:57.270 --> 00:56:57.280 align:start position:0%
with this if uh
 
00:57:00.230 --> 00:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
you know what would be to claim you know
 
00:57:03.190 --> 00:57:03.200 align:start position:0%
if somebody was actually 100
 
00:57:05.829 --> 00:57:05.839 align:start position:0%
doing their job where does that tally up
 
00:57:09.670 --> 00:57:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:11.349 --> 00:57:11.359 align:start position:0%
so so
 
00:57:13.349 --> 00:57:13.359 align:start position:0%
that would be the the part of the work
 
00:57:15.750 --> 00:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
that the oplc would do is if a complaint
 
00:57:16.950 --> 00:57:16.960 align:start position:0%
is made
 
00:57:18.390 --> 00:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
they would need to determine if there
 
00:57:20.710 --> 00:57:20.720 align:start position:0%
was a violation of a rule or a law
 
00:57:22.549 --> 00:57:22.559 align:start position:0%
so if someone wasn't happy with their
 
00:57:25.030 --> 00:57:25.040 align:start position:0%
assessment and they complained that's
 
00:57:26.789 --> 00:57:26.799 align:start position:0%
not a founded complaint there are other
 
00:57:28.390 --> 00:57:28.400 align:start position:0%
avenues to take care of that and that's
 
00:57:31.589 --> 00:57:31.599 align:start position:0%
not a violation of any rule or law
 
00:57:33.349 --> 00:57:33.359 align:start position:0%
you know people people don't necessarily
 
00:57:35.430 --> 00:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
like to pay taxes and they're unhappy
 
00:57:36.870 --> 00:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
even if the even if the numbers are
 
00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:37.910 align:start position:0%
even if the even if the numbers are
correct

00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:57:40.549 --> 00:57:40.559 align:start position:0%
so that would not be a founded complaint
 
00:57:42.309 --> 00:57:42.319 align:start position:0%
and that would not
 
00:57:43.349 --> 00:57:43.359 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:57:45.670 --> 00:57:45.680 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be a public black mark
 
00:57:47.430 --> 00:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
on somebody because that's never going
 
00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
to make the public record if it's an
 
00:57:50.309 --> 00:57:50.319 align:start position:0%
unfounded complaint
 
00:57:52.069 --> 00:57:52.079 align:start position:0%
and and that would be the same whether
 
00:57:53.670 --> 00:57:53.680 align:start position:0%
it stayed at the dra and the records
 
00:57:54.870 --> 00:57:54.880 align:start position:0%
were opened
 
00:57:58.710 --> 00:57:58.720 align:start position:0%
or whether it was set up with the oplc
 
00:58:01.109 --> 00:58:01.119 align:start position:0%
thank you sir
 
00:58:01.119 --> 00:58:02.789 align:start position:0%
thank you sir
representative

00:58:02.789 --> 00:58:02.799 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:58:05.349 --> 00:58:05.359 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:58:06.870 --> 00:58:06.880 align:start position:0%
mr gangney i'm
 
00:58:09.670 --> 00:58:09.680 align:start position:0%
trying quickly on my tablet to find
 
00:58:11.349 --> 00:58:11.359 align:start position:0%
the membership of the assessing
 
00:58:13.750 --> 00:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
standards board
 
00:58:16.230 --> 00:58:16.240 align:start position:0%
are there public members of that board
 
00:58:18.390 --> 00:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
yes the current makeup is
 
00:58:20.309 --> 00:58:20.319 align:start position:0%
there there are so
 
00:58:20.319 --> 00:58:21.190 align:start position:0%
there there are so
it's

00:58:21.190 --> 00:58:21.200 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:58:23.750 --> 00:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
two reps two state senators
 
00:58:25.030 --> 00:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of the department of
 
00:58:27.349 --> 00:58:27.359 align:start position:0%
revenue or their designee
 
00:58:30.069 --> 00:58:30.079 align:start position:0%
there are four assessing seats
 
00:58:31.670 --> 00:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
there are
 
00:58:34.710 --> 00:58:34.720 align:start position:0%
three municipal representatives and
 
00:58:37.270 --> 00:58:37.280 align:start position:0%
two or three members of the public
 
00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
there's 15 members all together
 
00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:41.430 align:start position:0%
there's 15 members all together
follow-up

00:58:41.430 --> 00:58:41.440 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:58:43.589 --> 00:58:43.599 align:start position:0%
and have you encountered
 
00:58:45.990 --> 00:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
any difficulties in getting
 
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:47.829 align:start position:0%
any difficulties in getting
members

00:58:47.829 --> 00:58:47.839 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:58:50.789 --> 00:58:50.799 align:start position:0%
to meetings and so forth we've heard
 
00:58:52.309 --> 00:58:52.319 align:start position:0%
testimony from
 
00:58:55.349 --> 00:58:55.359 align:start position:0%
oplc in recent weeks about
 
00:58:57.750 --> 00:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
difficulty of getting members
 
00:59:00.069 --> 00:59:00.079 align:start position:0%
for quorums for meetings and so forth
 
00:59:02.950 --> 00:59:02.960 align:start position:0%
and particularly public members so i'm a
 
00:59:04.630 --> 00:59:04.640 align:start position:0%
little concerned about the number of
 
00:59:09.109 --> 00:59:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:12.309 --> 00:59:12.319 align:start position:0%
so we do have a couple of open seats
 
00:59:15.109 --> 00:59:15.119 align:start position:0%
right now we've only had one public seat
 
00:59:18.549 --> 00:59:18.559 align:start position:0%
open for a prolonged period of time like
 
00:59:20.870 --> 00:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
three or four years i believe
 
00:59:22.870 --> 00:59:22.880 align:start position:0%
it hasn't been an issue with with making
 
00:59:25.670 --> 00:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
quorum at this point
 
00:59:27.750 --> 00:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
but i believe there are two more seats
 
00:59:29.270 --> 00:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
they can right now and it could become
 
00:59:31.430 --> 00:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
an issue
 
00:59:32.950 --> 00:59:32.960 align:start position:0%
and i don't know if it's a matter of
 
00:59:35.589 --> 00:59:35.599 align:start position:0%
people not willing to serve or
 
00:59:35.599 --> 00:59:36.390 align:start position:0%
people not willing to serve or
um

00:59:36.390 --> 00:59:36.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:38.710 --> 00:59:38.720 align:start position:0%
the processing not not taking place yet
 
00:59:40.390 --> 00:59:40.400 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that the four assessor
 
00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:41.589 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that the four assessor
seats

00:59:41.589 --> 00:59:41.599 align:start position:0%
seats
 
00:59:43.670 --> 00:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
we were up for renewal this year um last
 
00:59:47.349 --> 00:59:47.359 align:start position:0%
year september of 21 and
 
00:59:49.349 --> 00:59:49.359 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:59:51.349 --> 00:59:51.359 align:start position:0%
it's the new hampshire association of
 
00:59:53.430 --> 00:59:53.440 align:start position:0%
assessing officials that puts those
 
00:59:54.950 --> 00:59:54.960 align:start position:0%
names forward before the governor
 
00:59:56.390 --> 00:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
executive council
 
00:59:58.870 --> 00:59:58.880 align:start position:0%
and we have not received any indication
 
01:00:00.789 --> 01:00:00.799 align:start position:0%
that the council has heard
 
01:00:02.069 --> 01:00:02.079 align:start position:0%
um our
 
01:00:04.069 --> 01:00:04.079 align:start position:0%
you know and we we serve until we're
 
01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:06.160 align:start position:0%
replaced so the four of us is still
 
01:00:08.470 --> 01:00:08.480 align:start position:0%
serving but but we expired in september
 
01:00:09.990 --> 01:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
and that hasn't been filled yet so
 
01:00:11.829 --> 01:00:11.839 align:start position:0%
that's a processing it's you know there
 
01:00:12.789 --> 01:00:12.799 align:start position:0%
are four
 
01:00:14.549 --> 01:00:14.559 align:start position:0%
names they are ready to go
 
01:00:18.789 --> 01:00:18.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
representative seitan
 
01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
mr cagney you said something uh this
 
01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:26.640 align:start position:0%
this mirrors the real estate board and
 
01:00:28.630 --> 01:00:28.640 align:start position:0%
that you it's public information you
 
01:00:31.829 --> 01:00:31.839 align:start position:0%
could go back 30 years to find
 
01:00:34.069 --> 01:00:34.079 align:start position:0%
this behavior you think that
 
01:00:36.870 --> 01:00:36.880 align:start position:0%
somehow i'm uncomfortable with somebody
 
01:00:39.750 --> 01:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
record for 30 years would you have that
 
01:00:43.190 --> 01:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
in mind for accessory too
 
01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
their record would not clear after a
 
01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:46.069 align:start position:0%
their record would not clear after a
certain

01:00:46.069 --> 01:00:46.079 align:start position:0%
certain
 
01:00:48.789 --> 01:00:48.799 align:start position:0%
uh certain period of time seven years
 
01:00:50.549 --> 01:00:50.559 align:start position:0%
i i don't believe there isn't any
 
01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
clearance on that board certainly if
 
01:00:57.829 --> 01:00:57.839 align:start position:0%
if if it was the intent of the lawmakers
 
01:00:59.750 --> 01:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
to have some such provision
 
01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:01.190 align:start position:0%
to have some such provision
um

01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
i guess i'd have to think about what
 
01:01:04.470 --> 01:01:04.480 align:start position:0%
that period of time would be
 
01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:05.349 align:start position:0%
that period of time would be
um

01:01:05.349 --> 01:01:05.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:07.750 --> 01:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
and then it also would be you know if
 
01:01:09.910 --> 01:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
you have another infraction it seems to
 
01:01:11.589 --> 01:01:11.599 align:start position:0%
me that that information ought to stay
 
01:01:13.990 --> 01:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
no matter how far back it goes
 
01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.829 align:start position:0%
no matter how far back it goes
so

01:01:15.829 --> 01:01:15.839 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:01:18.069 --> 01:01:18.079 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any other questions
 
01:01:19.750 --> 01:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
representative broda
 
01:01:22.829 --> 01:01:22.839 align:start position:0%
thank you so in in some
 
01:01:22.839 --> 01:01:24.630 align:start position:0%
thank you so in in some
i

01:01:24.630 --> 01:01:24.640 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:01:29.430 --> 01:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
are you asking then in the statute to
 
01:01:31.990 --> 01:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
move the board
 
01:01:34.950 --> 01:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
from under the supervision of the dra
 
01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:35.910 align:start position:0%
from under the supervision of the dra
to

01:01:35.910 --> 01:01:35.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:01:39.510 --> 01:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
so the assessing standards board would
 
01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:42.789 align:start position:0%
so the assessing standards board would
continue

01:01:42.789 --> 01:01:42.799 align:start position:0%
continue
 
01:01:45.109 --> 01:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
as it exists today
 
01:01:46.549 --> 01:01:46.559 align:start position:0%
this would set up
 
01:01:48.789 --> 01:01:48.799 align:start position:0%
another board an assessing certification
 
01:01:51.430 --> 01:01:51.440 align:start position:0%
board that would be under the oplc but
 
01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
the assessing standards board would
 
01:01:55.430 --> 01:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
still be administratively tied to the
 
01:01:59.670 --> 01:01:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:03.270 --> 01:02:03.280 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions
 
01:02:05.270 --> 01:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
representative fellow
 
01:02:06.870 --> 01:02:06.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:08.390 align:start position:0%
thank you
i

01:02:08.390 --> 01:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:02:10.470 --> 01:02:10.480 align:start position:0%
tell me what i'm not understanding here
 
01:02:13.029 --> 01:02:13.039 align:start position:0%
because for me it seems to me that the
 
01:02:15.589 --> 01:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
board that creates the standards
 
01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
would be the best group of people to
 
01:02:20.710 --> 01:02:20.720 align:start position:0%
judge if somebody's violated those
 
01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:24.230 align:start position:0%
judge if somebody's violated those
standards

01:02:24.230 --> 01:02:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:26.230 --> 01:02:26.240 align:start position:0%
that's a good question now
 
01:02:28.470 --> 01:02:28.480 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:02:31.029 --> 01:02:31.039 align:start position:0%
the qualifications to be an assessor
 
01:02:32.950 --> 01:02:32.960 align:start position:0%
would fall under the new assessing
 
01:02:34.470 --> 01:02:34.480 align:start position:0%
certification board
 
01:02:36.069 --> 01:02:36.079 align:start position:0%
the education the experience and so
 
01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
forth i would see those rules
 
01:02:40.630 --> 01:02:40.640 align:start position:0%
of the asb moving over
 
01:02:41.750 --> 01:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
but there are
 
01:02:45.190 --> 01:02:45.200 align:start position:0%
assessing standards that apply to
 
01:02:46.950 --> 01:02:46.960 align:start position:0%
not just individuals but to
 
01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:48.549 align:start position:0%
not just individuals but to
jurisdictions

01:02:48.549 --> 01:02:48.559 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions
 
01:02:50.789 --> 01:02:50.799 align:start position:0%
you know cities and towns need to have
 
01:02:53.109 --> 01:02:53.119 align:start position:0%
values anew every five years
 
01:02:55.029 --> 01:02:55.039 align:start position:0%
they need to be done under certain
 
01:02:57.029 --> 01:02:57.039 align:start position:0%
standards meaning when you do a
 
01:02:59.670 --> 01:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
revaluation your results need to be
 
01:03:03.990 --> 01:03:04.000 align:start position:0%
within certain uh statistical tests
 
01:03:06.069 --> 01:03:06.079 align:start position:0%
that's separate from certifying the
 
01:03:07.750 --> 01:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
individuals do the work
 
01:03:10.390 --> 01:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
those are requirements on
 
01:03:13.589 --> 01:03:13.599 align:start position:0%
boards of assessors boards of selectmen
 
01:03:16.950 --> 01:03:16.960 align:start position:0%
other other governing bodies so
 
01:03:18.789 --> 01:03:18.799 align:start position:0%
you know while while everything that
 
01:03:20.390 --> 01:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
falls under the assessing standards
 
01:03:22.230 --> 01:03:22.240 align:start position:0%
board purview now
 
01:03:23.910 --> 01:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
isn't going to stay there
 
01:03:25.670 --> 01:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
you know certification
 
01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:26.630 align:start position:0%
you know certification
rules

01:03:26.630 --> 01:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
rules
 
01:03:28.230 --> 01:03:28.240 align:start position:0%
and disciplinary rules are going to move
 
01:03:31.589 --> 01:03:31.599 align:start position:0%
over to that new board but the standards
 
01:03:34.630 --> 01:03:34.640 align:start position:0%
under which assessing is conducted
 
01:03:36.150 --> 01:03:36.160 align:start position:0%
you know that that you review your
 
01:03:38.470 --> 01:03:38.480 align:start position:0%
records that your values fall within
 
01:03:39.829 --> 01:03:39.839 align:start position:0%
certain ranges
 
01:03:41.270 --> 01:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
those would stay on the assessing
 
01:03:45.270 --> 01:03:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:46.870 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

01:03:46.870 --> 01:03:46.880 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:03:49.029 --> 01:03:49.039 align:start position:0%
so it's possible i'm starting to get a
 
01:03:52.150 --> 01:03:52.160 align:start position:0%
hold of this so the existing board now
 
01:03:54.950 --> 01:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
which is the assessing standards board
 
01:03:56.789 --> 01:03:56.799 align:start position:0%
is that really
 
01:03:59.750 --> 01:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
focused more on what municipalities are
 
01:04:01.829 --> 01:04:01.839 align:start position:0%
doing and you're because you're telling
 
01:04:03.910 --> 01:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
me you know they have to do the
 
01:04:06.230 --> 01:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
reassessment every five years and not so
 
01:04:09.430 --> 01:04:09.440 align:start position:0%
much on the people who are doing it
 
01:04:12.710 --> 01:04:12.720 align:start position:0%
the qual the qualified people who are
 
01:04:14.950 --> 01:04:14.960 align:start position:0%
doing the assessment
 
01:04:17.589 --> 01:04:17.599 align:start position:0%
so so today it's both
 
01:04:19.990 --> 01:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
both what you know what work the
 
01:04:21.990 --> 01:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities do and also the
 
01:04:24.230 --> 01:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
qualifications of the individual what
 
01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
we're proposing is that
 
01:04:28.390 --> 01:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
the qualifications the certification of
 
01:04:30.309 --> 01:04:30.319 align:start position:0%
the individuals be moved over to that
 
01:04:32.069 --> 01:04:32.079 align:start position:0%
independent board
 
01:04:33.829 --> 01:04:33.839 align:start position:0%
and the other duties
 
01:04:39.190 --> 01:04:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:04:42.390 --> 01:04:42.400 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
01:04:43.990 --> 01:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
all right i'd like thank you for your
 
01:04:46.230 --> 01:04:46.240 align:start position:0%
testimony i did just have one other a
 
01:04:47.910 --> 01:04:47.920 align:start position:0%
couple of notes that i had that i i
 
01:04:49.589 --> 01:04:49.599 align:start position:0%
didn't address yet if i could
 
01:04:52.390 --> 01:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
oh if i could do a follow-up
 
01:04:55.349 --> 01:04:55.359 align:start position:0%
yes follow-up so um one of the things i
 
01:04:57.029 --> 01:04:57.039 align:start position:0%
wanted to mention um
 
01:04:59.270 --> 01:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
in talking with my peers is that
 
01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:00.390 align:start position:0%
in talking with my peers is that
um

01:05:00.390 --> 01:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:01.750 --> 01:05:01.760 align:start position:0%
we kind of view sometimes that there
 
01:05:03.270 --> 01:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
might be a conflict of interest with the
 
01:05:04.470 --> 01:05:04.480 align:start position:0%
way it's set up today with the
 
01:05:05.990 --> 01:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
department of revenue
 
01:05:08.150 --> 01:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
um and we feel this would take that out
 
01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:09.430 align:start position:0%
um and we feel this would take that out
entirely

01:05:09.430 --> 01:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
entirely
 
01:05:11.109 --> 01:05:11.119 align:start position:0%
between the department of revenue their
 
01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
employees and
 
01:05:14.950 --> 01:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
the assessing individuals out there that
 
01:05:18.870 --> 01:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:22.789 --> 01:05:22.799 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you uh carolyn
 
01:05:22.799 --> 01:05:40.470 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you uh carolyn
learn

01:05:40.470 --> 01:05:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:42.470 --> 01:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
good morning carolyn lear i'm the
 
01:05:44.150 --> 01:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner at the department
 
01:05:45.349 --> 01:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
of revenue
 
01:05:46.789 --> 01:05:46.799 align:start position:0%
i'm honestly really here at your
 
01:05:48.710 --> 01:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
pleasure for your questions if you have
 
01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:49.990 align:start position:0%
pleasure for your questions if you have
them

01:05:49.990 --> 01:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:05:52.309 --> 01:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
but i would take a second of liberty
 
01:05:54.470 --> 01:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
just to emphasize
 
01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:55.670 align:start position:0%
just to emphasize
that

01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:05:57.990 --> 01:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
assessors play a hugely
 
01:05:59.670 --> 01:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
important role
 
01:06:05.109 --> 01:06:05.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:07.510 --> 01:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
certainly from the state's perspective
 
01:06:09.910 --> 01:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
the state has a direct interest
 
01:06:11.589 --> 01:06:11.599 align:start position:0%
in ensuring that those who perform the
 
01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
assessments for purposes of property
 
01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:15.029 align:start position:0%
assessments for purposes of property
taxes

01:06:15.029 --> 01:06:15.039 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
01:06:18.630 --> 01:06:18.640 align:start position:0%
are qualified to do that role very
 
01:06:21.910 --> 01:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
specifically with respect to the 363
 
01:06:23.910 --> 01:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
million dollars in swept that gets
 
01:06:26.069 --> 01:06:26.079 align:start position:0%
assessed every year
 
01:06:28.950 --> 01:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
but also with respect to the over four
 
01:06:31.430 --> 01:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
billion dollars of local property taxes
 
01:06:34.230 --> 01:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
that get assessed each year
 
01:06:37.349 --> 01:06:37.359 align:start position:0%
property taxes are by far the largest
 
01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:39.839 align:start position:0%
revenue stream in the state
 
01:06:42.950 --> 01:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
the next being the business tax which is
 
01:06:45.510 --> 01:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
only a billion and only hit the billion
 
01:06:48.150 --> 01:06:48.160 align:start position:0%
mark within the last year
 
01:06:50.630 --> 01:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
so i would just encourage you as you are
 
01:06:52.950 --> 01:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
considering this policy decision
 
01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:54.150 align:start position:0%
considering this policy decision
um

01:06:54.150 --> 01:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:56.789 --> 01:06:56.799 align:start position:0%
to think about just how important the
 
01:07:00.309 --> 01:07:00.319 align:start position:0%
role of assessor certification is
 
01:07:02.549 --> 01:07:02.559 align:start position:0%
otherwise the only other note i would
 
01:07:04.870 --> 01:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
make and mr gagne
 
01:07:08.069 --> 01:07:08.079 align:start position:0%
did refer to it briefly there is another
 
01:07:10.710 --> 01:07:10.720 align:start position:0%
bill coming from the senate
 
01:07:13.829 --> 01:07:13.839 align:start position:0%
senate bill 53
 
01:07:16.630 --> 01:07:16.640 align:start position:0%
is a more exacting
 
01:07:18.789 --> 01:07:18.799 align:start position:0%
attempt to make
 
01:07:20.950 --> 01:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
the assessor certification records
 
01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:22.309 align:start position:0%
the assessor certification records
public

01:07:22.309 --> 01:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:07:24.150 --> 01:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
as some of you may have encountered the
 
01:07:26.630 --> 01:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
department of revenue has a pretty broad
 
01:07:28.870 --> 01:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
confidentiality statute
 
01:07:31.270 --> 01:07:31.280 align:start position:0%
that makes pretty much everything that
 
01:07:33.910 --> 01:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
the department does confidential absent
 
01:07:37.190 --> 01:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
an exception and senate bill 53
 
01:07:39.109 --> 01:07:39.119 align:start position:0%
would make
 
01:07:40.390 --> 01:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
an exception to our broad
 
01:07:43.029 --> 01:07:43.039 align:start position:0%
confidentiality statute
 
01:07:45.430 --> 01:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
relative to assessor certification
 
01:07:47.190 --> 01:07:47.200 align:start position:0%
records and
 
01:07:49.670 --> 01:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
if that were to pass we would have no
 
01:07:52.069 --> 01:07:52.079 align:start position:0%
problem sharing those records freely
 
01:07:54.549 --> 01:07:54.559 align:start position:0%
it's really a statutory issue currently
 
01:07:56.870 --> 01:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
that prevents us from sharing both
 
01:07:58.710 --> 01:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
certification records as well as
 
01:08:00.549 --> 01:08:00.559 align:start position:0%
disciplinary records
 
01:08:02.150 --> 01:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
with that i'm happy to answer any of the
 
01:08:04.150 --> 01:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
committee's questions
 
01:08:05.910 --> 01:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
thank you i take it the department is
 
01:08:08.150 --> 01:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
not opposed to losing the
 
01:08:10.230 --> 01:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
to creating a new board about assessor

of representative scitec
 
01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't sp 53 take care of this
 
01:08:33.189 --> 01:08:33.199 align:start position:0%
situation why do we even have um
 
01:08:36.630 --> 01:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
this bill if sb 53 takes care of the
 
01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
confidentiality the transparency issue
 
01:08:42.309 --> 01:08:42.319 align:start position:0%
that mr gagne raised as the principal
 
01:08:45.030 --> 01:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
mode of impetus for the bill
 
01:08:46.229 --> 01:08:46.239 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i could answer that
 
01:08:46.239 --> 01:08:50.870 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i could answer that
question

01:08:50.870 --> 01:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:53.269 --> 01:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
01:08:54.789 --> 01:08:54.799 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none thank you very
 
01:08:54.799 --> 01:08:56.390 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none thank you very
much

01:08:56.390 --> 01:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:09:02.950 --> 01:09:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:04.829 --> 01:09:04.839 align:start position:0%
i do have some written
 
01:09:14.070 --> 01:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:15.749 --> 01:09:15.759 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you for giving me the
 
01:09:17.430 --> 01:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak
 
01:09:19.030 --> 01:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
my name is scott bartlett i am the
 
01:09:21.669 --> 01:09:21.679 align:start position:0%
assessor for the town of goffstown
 
01:09:23.910 --> 01:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not taking a position on this bill
 
01:09:25.590 --> 01:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
one way or the other
 
01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:26.630 align:start position:0%
one way or the other
um

01:09:26.630 --> 01:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:29.110 --> 01:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
if this is done properly i don't really
 
01:09:31.110 --> 01:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
believe it it makes a difference to me
 
01:09:32.309 --> 01:09:32.319 align:start position:0%
whether i am
 
01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
being certified by the department of
 
01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
revenue or a certification board
 
01:09:39.990 --> 01:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
i do have some concerns
 
01:09:43.349 --> 01:09:43.359 align:start position:0%
with the way this bill is written
 
01:09:45.430 --> 01:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
my first and most major concern has to
 
01:09:47.349 --> 01:09:47.359 align:start position:0%
do with transition
 
01:09:50.390 --> 01:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
as i read the bill it does appear that
 
01:09:53.669 --> 01:09:53.679 align:start position:0%
on january 1st 2023 if this bill were to
 
01:09:53.679 --> 01:09:55.030 align:start position:0%
on january 1st 2023 if this bill were to
pass

01:09:55.030 --> 01:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
pass
 
01:09:57.430 --> 01:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
no one in the state would be certified
 
01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
i do do not believe there is time to
 
01:10:02.470 --> 01:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
get this in place
 
01:10:04.390 --> 01:10:04.400 align:start position:0%
in less than a year and have all the
 
01:10:06.790 --> 01:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
certifications be
 
01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:08.229 align:start position:0%
certifications be
renewed

01:10:08.229 --> 01:10:08.239 align:start position:0%
renewed
 
01:10:09.990 --> 01:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
there's no grandfather clause in this
 
01:10:12.070 --> 01:10:12.080 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
01:10:14.149 --> 01:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
transition from
 
01:10:14.159 --> 01:10:16.630 align:start position:0%
transition from
current

01:10:16.630 --> 01:10:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:19.189 --> 01:10:19.199 align:start position:0%
certification to the new certification
 
01:10:19.199 --> 01:10:20.070 align:start position:0%
certification to the new certification
board

01:10:20.070 --> 01:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
board
 
01:10:24.229 --> 01:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
right now i am a certified new hampshire
 
01:10:28.310 --> 01:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:31.669 --> 01:10:31.679 align:start position:0%
my term runs out in 2024.
 
01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
but if this bill were to pass i believe
 
01:10:35.669 --> 01:10:35.679 align:start position:0%
that on january
 
01:10:37.990 --> 01:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
or actually be december 31st
 
01:10:39.510 --> 01:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
of the end of this year i would no
 
01:10:41.350 --> 01:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
longer be certified
 
01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:42.870 align:start position:0%
longer be certified
um

01:10:42.870 --> 01:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:44.790 --> 01:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
that's a concern
 
01:10:46.550 --> 01:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
because i'm looking to protect my town
 
01:10:48.870 --> 01:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
town of goffstown to make sure that on
 
01:10:50.870 --> 01:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
january 1st of next year
 
01:10:53.430 --> 01:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
i can continue to do my job
 
01:10:55.430 --> 01:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
so i do it believe at the very least
 
01:10:57.110 --> 01:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
there would need to be some type of a
 
01:10:58.870 --> 01:10:58.880 align:start position:0%
grandfathering clause
 
01:11:03.189 --> 01:11:03.199 align:start position:0%
some way to transition smoothly from
 
01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
the dra to this new board
 
01:11:08.790 --> 01:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
the other concern i have
 
01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:10.149 align:start position:0%
the other concern i have
is

01:11:10.149 --> 01:11:10.159 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:11:13.830 --> 01:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
with the definition of the three
 
01:11:16.550 --> 01:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
assessor members on this board
 
01:11:19.910 --> 01:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
it's very broad it has no limitations as
 
01:11:22.310 --> 01:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
to who they should be
 
01:11:24.790 --> 01:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
as i read it i believe you could have
 
01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:25.750 align:start position:0%
as i read it i believe you could have
three

01:11:25.750 --> 01:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:11:27.430 --> 01:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
dra employees
 
01:11:29.910 --> 01:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
as the three assessors i don't believe
 
01:11:32.070 --> 01:11:32.080 align:start position:0%
that would happen but the way the bill
 
01:11:33.990 --> 01:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
is written that could happen
 
01:11:35.990 --> 01:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
so i would
 
01:11:37.590 --> 01:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
recommend that there be some
 
01:11:40.709 --> 01:11:40.719 align:start position:0%
clarification as to who those members
 
01:11:41.750 --> 01:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
should be
 
01:11:43.750 --> 01:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
in my opinion you should have a city
 
01:11:46.310 --> 01:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
assessor employed by a city a town
 
01:11:48.149 --> 01:11:48.159 align:start position:0%
assessor employed by a town and maybe a
 
01:11:50.550 --> 01:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
contracted assessor but again those are
 
01:11:53.189 --> 01:11:53.199 align:start position:0%
just my suggestions and
 
01:11:55.189 --> 01:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
for making this bill
 
01:11:57.189 --> 01:11:57.199 align:start position:0%
a little bit better
 
01:11:59.510 --> 01:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
the the third issue that i looked at was
 
01:12:02.310 --> 01:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
the number of public members now it was
 
01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
already mentioned here that there seems
 
01:12:06.870 --> 01:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
to be a difficulty of getting public
 
01:12:09.990 --> 01:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
members to attend meetings
 
01:12:11.990 --> 01:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
i also was concerned about the number of
 
01:12:13.510 --> 01:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
public members
 
01:12:16.149 --> 01:12:16.159 align:start position:0%
i did look at a lot of the other boards
 
01:12:17.990 --> 01:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire and
 
01:12:19.750 --> 01:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
remember this is a licensing a
 
01:12:22.550 --> 01:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
professional licensing board
 
01:12:23.750 --> 01:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
not a
 
01:12:25.189 --> 01:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
standards board similar to what the
 
01:12:27.830 --> 01:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
assessing standards board is
 
01:12:29.030 --> 01:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
this is
 
01:12:32.149 --> 01:12:32.159 align:start position:0%
deals with professionals and the vast
 
01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
majority of the other boards in this
 
01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:35.590 align:start position:0%
majority of the other boards in this
state

01:12:35.590 --> 01:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:12:38.390 --> 01:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
the professionals are the majority of
 
01:12:40.229 --> 01:12:40.239 align:start position:0%
those boards that is not the case with
 
01:12:42.390 --> 01:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
this particular board the other thing i
 
01:12:44.709 --> 01:12:44.719 align:start position:0%
noticed that the public members in every
 
01:12:46.229 --> 01:12:46.239 align:start position:0%
board i looked at
 
01:12:47.910 --> 01:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
were less than
 
01:12:49.510 --> 01:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
the professional members in this case
 
01:12:51.590 --> 01:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
it's the same number
 
01:12:53.030 --> 01:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
the one thing i
 
01:12:55.030 --> 01:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
notice that's missing is other
 
01:12:57.430 --> 01:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
professionals from different fields so i
 
01:12:58.950 --> 01:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
would recommend
 
01:13:01.430 --> 01:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
possibly considering a
 
01:13:03.830 --> 01:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
certified appraiser certified with the
 
01:13:05.430 --> 01:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
new hampshire real estate appraiser
 
01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
board and maybe even a um
 
01:13:11.590 --> 01:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
a real estate broker or agent
 
01:13:14.070 --> 01:13:14.080 align:start position:0%
these are individuals who
 
01:13:16.149 --> 01:13:16.159 align:start position:0%
are not assessors they don't understand
 
01:13:18.390 --> 01:13:18.400 align:start position:0%
exactly what we do but they're very
 
01:13:20.390 --> 01:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
similar fields and they would have a lot
 
01:13:22.229 --> 01:13:22.239 align:start position:0%
of input and i think they would be a
 
01:13:25.590 --> 01:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
great asset to this board
 
01:13:28.310 --> 01:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
again as i said i'm not opposed to the
 
01:13:30.630 --> 01:13:30.640 align:start position:0%
general idea of this
 
01:13:32.790 --> 01:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
but i do believe this particular bill
 
01:13:36.630 --> 01:13:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:37.910 --> 01:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony will you
 
01:13:39.189 --> 01:13:39.199 align:start position:0%

01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am representative

familiar with the senate bill that was
mentioned

01:13:58.070 --> 01:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
01:14:00.550 --> 01:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
i have heard of that as well i do
 
01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:01.990 align:start position:0%
i have heard of that as well i do
believe

01:14:01.990 --> 01:14:02.000 align:start position:0%

01:14:04.149 --> 01:14:04.159 align:start position:0%
i'll be honest with you i will support
 
01:14:06.070 --> 01:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
that particular bill
 
01:14:08.950 --> 01:14:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:12.950 --> 01:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:15.030 --> 01:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien
 
01:14:17.189 --> 01:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh mr bartlett
 
01:14:19.910 --> 01:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um
 
01:14:22.070 --> 01:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
you said there will be a vacancy if this
 
01:14:24.790 --> 01:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
bill becomes enacted from the start date
 
01:14:27.910 --> 01:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
trying to look it up right now but uh
 
01:14:29.830 --> 01:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
there'll be leeway nobody would be
 
01:14:33.030 --> 01:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
certified how long is the certification
 
01:14:34.950 --> 01:14:34.960 align:start position:0%
like as a gentleman as yourself to get
 
01:14:37.350 --> 01:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
yourself up to speed if this bill was
 
01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:40.550 align:start position:0%
yourself up to speed if this bill was
enacted

01:14:40.550 --> 01:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:42.870 --> 01:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
um i'm not sure okay what i mean is you
 
01:14:45.430 --> 01:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
said uh if this bill is enacted nobody
 
01:14:47.270 --> 01:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
would be certified
 
01:14:49.750 --> 01:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
okay you would have to get recertified
 
01:14:51.030 --> 01:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
you know people would have to get
 
01:14:54.709 --> 01:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
certification how long does that take
 
01:14:56.550 --> 01:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
i'm not exactly sure how long it would
 
01:14:58.709 --> 01:14:58.719 align:start position:0%
take because again this bill is kind of
 
01:15:00.709 --> 01:15:00.719 align:start position:0%
vague as to how
 
01:15:04.070 --> 01:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
that board is is created so
 
01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:05.430 align:start position:0%
that board is is created so
uh

01:15:05.430 --> 01:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:15:08.229 --> 01:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
a lot of it has to do with how quickly
 
01:15:08.239 --> 01:15:09.110 align:start position:0%
a lot of it has to do with how quickly
the

01:15:09.110 --> 01:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:15:10.870 --> 01:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
positions get filled
 
01:15:13.110 --> 01:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
i mean no one can be certified until
 
01:15:15.030 --> 01:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
there's a board to start with so on
 
01:15:18.390 --> 01:15:18.400 align:start position:0%
january 1st of next year has this board
 
01:15:20.390 --> 01:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
already been created
 
01:15:22.550 --> 01:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
will the governor have had time to put
 
01:15:24.870 --> 01:15:24.880 align:start position:0%
those members in if not there's no one
 
01:15:26.070 --> 01:15:26.080 align:start position:0%
there to
 
01:15:28.709 --> 01:15:28.719 align:start position:0%
certify me
 
01:15:31.189 --> 01:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
i mean typically the process with a
 
01:15:33.910 --> 01:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
board that is up and going i am also a
 
01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:35.669 align:start position:0%
board that is up and going i am also a
certified

01:15:35.669 --> 01:15:35.679 align:start position:0%
certified
 
01:15:37.669 --> 01:15:37.679 align:start position:0%
appraiser with a real estate appraiser
 
01:15:37.679 --> 01:15:38.630 align:start position:0%
appraiser with a real estate appraiser
board

01:15:38.630 --> 01:15:38.640 align:start position:0%
board
 
01:15:40.470 --> 01:15:40.480 align:start position:0%
that process is very quick very
 
01:15:42.470 --> 01:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
efficient but that board has been up and
 
01:15:45.270 --> 01:15:45.280 align:start position:0%
running for a number of years so a year
 
01:15:47.669 --> 01:15:47.679 align:start position:0%
from now or two years from now
 
01:15:50.149 --> 01:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
i don't believe there'll be much delay
 
01:15:52.630 --> 01:15:52.640 align:start position:0%
it's just that in that transition period
 
01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:53.750 align:start position:0%
it's just that in that transition period
getting

01:15:53.750 --> 01:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
getting
 
01:15:56.149 --> 01:15:56.159 align:start position:0%
the board created getting everybody on
 
01:15:58.229 --> 01:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
board determining
 
01:16:00.550 --> 01:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
what the qualifications are
 
01:16:02.470 --> 01:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
that's not addressed here so i'm just
 
01:16:04.709 --> 01:16:04.719 align:start position:0%
concerned with that one to two year
 
01:16:07.510 --> 01:16:07.520 align:start position:0%
period of transitioning from one to the
 
01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:08.550 align:start position:0%
period of transitioning from one to the
other

01:16:08.550 --> 01:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:16:11.830 --> 01:16:11.840 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up okay what datton
 
01:16:14.550 --> 01:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
stated in looking at and i have yet to
 
01:16:17.270 --> 01:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
see it but looking at senate bill 53
 
01:16:19.270 --> 01:16:19.280 align:start position:0%
debt is addressed in that senate bill
 
01:16:21.750 --> 01:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
then well the senate bill is is
 
01:16:24.390 --> 01:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
different in that it's changing the
 
01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:26.630 align:start position:0%
different in that it's changing the
um

01:16:26.630 --> 01:16:26.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:29.430 align:start position:0%
um
confidentiality

01:16:29.430 --> 01:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
confidentiality
 
01:16:31.350 --> 01:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
of the dra has nothing to do with
 
01:16:32.709 --> 01:16:32.719 align:start position:0%
creating a
 
01:16:35.350 --> 01:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
a licensing board
 
01:16:37.510 --> 01:16:37.520 align:start position:0%
there would be no issue there because
 
01:16:39.430 --> 01:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
we're not in that case if that bill were
 
01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
passed and this one we're not
 
01:16:42.870 --> 01:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
in that case
 
01:16:44.550 --> 01:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't have to transition because
 
01:16:46.830 --> 01:16:46.840 align:start position:0%
we would still be certified through the
 
01:16:49.350 --> 01:16:49.360 align:start position:0%
dri very good thank you for the
 
01:16:51.189 --> 01:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
clarification thank you representative
 
01:16:53.430 --> 01:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
marsh uh thank you madam sharon thank
 
01:16:54.790 --> 01:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question i don't know
 
01:16:56.229 --> 01:16:56.239 align:start position:0%
if you have a copy of the bill in front
 
01:16:57.750 --> 01:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
of you if you don't
 
01:16:59.510 --> 01:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
you might need to get one
 
01:17:02.229 --> 01:17:02.239 align:start position:0%
my question is would your concerns about
 
01:17:04.790 --> 01:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
the transition period be adequately
 
01:17:06.870 --> 01:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
addressed if we just changed the
 
01:17:09.030 --> 01:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
effective date of section 5 of the bill
 
01:17:10.390 --> 01:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
which is when
 
01:17:12.229 --> 01:17:12.239 align:start position:0%
the certification changes to the new
 
01:17:12.239 --> 01:17:13.110 align:start position:0%
the certification changes to the new
board

01:17:13.110 --> 01:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
board
 
01:17:15.590 --> 01:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
to an effective date two years hence
 
01:17:17.750 --> 01:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
and that way the board can be set up and
 
01:17:19.189 --> 01:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
everybody will know when the new board
 
01:17:21.110 --> 01:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
will take effect and we can continue to
 
01:17:22.390 --> 01:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
operate under the old board in the
 
01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:24.149 align:start position:0%
operate under the old board in the
meantime

01:17:24.149 --> 01:17:24.159 align:start position:0%
meantime
 
01:17:26.149 --> 01:17:26.159 align:start position:0%
i do believe that would
 
01:17:28.550 --> 01:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
take care of a lot of the concerns
 
01:17:31.590 --> 01:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:17:33.590 --> 01:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:17:35.830 --> 01:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
01:17:39.110 --> 01:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
thank you can you just tell us about
 
01:17:42.229 --> 01:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
what the qualifications are you know i
 
01:17:43.950 --> 01:17:43.960 align:start position:0%
don't need too technical the
 
01:17:48.149 --> 01:17:48.159 align:start position:0%
qualifications to be an assessor okay
 
01:17:49.590 --> 01:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
well first of all there's a number of
 
01:17:51.910 --> 01:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
different categories i am a assessor
 
01:17:54.229 --> 01:17:54.239 align:start position:0%
supervisor which is the highest
 
01:17:57.030 --> 01:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
category of certification for an
 
01:17:59.189 --> 01:17:59.199 align:start position:0%
assessor in order to be a supervisor i
 
01:18:00.790 --> 01:18:00.800 align:start position:0%
need five years of experience in
 
01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:02.229 align:start position:0%
need five years of experience in
assessing

01:18:02.229 --> 01:18:02.239 align:start position:0%
assessing
 
01:18:03.750 --> 01:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
i need
 
01:18:05.669 --> 01:18:05.679 align:start position:0%
i don't know the exact hours but i
 
01:18:07.990 --> 01:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
believe it's around 300 hours of
 
01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.070 align:start position:0%
believe it's around 300 hours of
education

01:18:10.070 --> 01:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:18:12.709 --> 01:18:12.719 align:start position:0%
i need to there's a couple of other
 
01:18:16.070 --> 01:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
i need to have worked on a revaluation
 
01:18:18.950 --> 01:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
i need to have testified in court
 
01:18:21.990 --> 01:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
for assessing purposes
 
01:18:25.430 --> 01:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
the qualifications are fairly extensive
 
01:18:27.189 --> 01:18:27.199 align:start position:0%
it isn't something that
 
01:18:28.630 --> 01:18:28.640 align:start position:0%
someone can come off the street and be
 
01:18:31.030 --> 01:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
an assessor tomorrow it takes it takes
 
01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:32.709 align:start position:0%
an assessor tomorrow it takes it takes
time

01:18:32.709 --> 01:18:32.719 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:18:36.470 --> 01:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
the lowest level of certification is a
 
01:18:39.189 --> 01:18:39.199 align:start position:0%
measure and lister
 
01:18:43.590 --> 01:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:47.990 --> 01:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
i think 160 hours of of being supervised
 
01:18:49.350 --> 01:18:49.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:50.470 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

01:18:50.470 --> 01:18:50.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:51.590 --> 01:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
and then there's different levels
 
01:18:53.910 --> 01:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
there's an assessor super our assessor
 
01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:54.950 align:start position:0%
there's an assessor super our assessor
trainee

01:18:54.950 --> 01:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
trainee
 
01:18:56.550 --> 01:18:56.560 align:start position:0%
and then there's an assessor and then
 
01:18:58.870 --> 01:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
the final step would be a supervisor so
 
01:19:00.790 --> 01:19:00.800 align:start position:0%
each step has
 
01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:02.070 align:start position:0%
each step has
education

01:19:02.070 --> 01:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:19:06.310 --> 01:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
requirements has experience requirements
 
01:19:08.149 --> 01:19:08.159 align:start position:0%
something that has just been initiated
 
01:19:10.149 --> 01:19:10.159 align:start position:0%
to be a supervisor you now have to pass
 
01:19:12.149 --> 01:19:12.159 align:start position:0%
a test
 
01:19:14.470 --> 01:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
many of us that are assessor supervisors
 
01:19:15.990 --> 01:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
are also certified new hampshire
 
01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:17.270 align:start position:0%
are also certified new hampshire
assessors

01:19:17.270 --> 01:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
assessors
 
01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:18.550 align:start position:0%
assessors
which

01:19:18.550 --> 01:19:18.560 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:19:21.430 --> 01:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
we've already taken a test i took a test
 
01:19:24.149 --> 01:19:24.159 align:start position:0%
in order to become a cnha certified new
 
01:19:26.310 --> 01:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire assessor
 
01:19:27.910 --> 01:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
again that's another question i have
 
01:19:30.950 --> 01:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
with farm is for the transition do i
 
01:19:33.189 --> 01:19:33.199 align:start position:0%
have to take that test again
 
01:19:35.270 --> 01:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
if i have to i will
 
01:19:36.790 --> 01:19:36.800 align:start position:0%
but these are some of the questions that
 
01:19:40.870 --> 01:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:42.870 --> 01:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
represented pearson thank you thank you
 
01:19:46.149 --> 01:19:46.159 align:start position:0%
mr bartlett for coming up from goffstown
 
01:19:47.669 --> 01:19:47.679 align:start position:0%
for this
 
01:19:49.910 --> 01:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
as the chairman of the subcommittee on
 
01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:50.950 align:start position:0%
as the chairman of the subcommittee on
uh

01:19:50.950 --> 01:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:19:52.870 --> 01:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
licensing we we look at all kinds of
 
01:19:55.189 --> 01:19:55.199 align:start position:0%
things that need little tweaks and
 
01:19:57.669 --> 01:19:57.679 align:start position:0%
twists to work i'm wearing a pen out
 
01:19:58.790 --> 01:19:58.800 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:20:00.149 --> 01:20:00.159 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
01:20:01.669 --> 01:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
if this was to go to interim study and
 
01:20:03.669 --> 01:20:03.679 align:start position:0%
we actually took took a look at this
 
01:20:06.709 --> 01:20:06.719 align:start position:0%
more in the off season so to speak
 
01:20:07.990 --> 01:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
would that be something you'd be willing
 
01:20:10.149 --> 01:20:10.159 align:start position:0%
to contribute to to help
 
01:20:14.390 --> 01:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
assist with the the clear the clearly
 
01:20:17.510 --> 01:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
clearly gaps that that have existed
 
01:20:19.189 --> 01:20:19.199 align:start position:0%
in just your you know your that you've
 
01:20:21.270 --> 01:20:21.280 align:start position:0%
brought up in your testimony so far
 
01:20:23.750 --> 01:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
yes sir most definitely
 
01:20:27.189 --> 01:20:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:28.790 --> 01:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
madam chair you already took my question
 
01:20:32.149 --> 01:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:33.910 --> 01:20:33.920 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:37.350 align:start position:0%
any other questions
representative

01:20:37.350 --> 01:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:38.950 --> 01:20:38.960 align:start position:0%
so i just took a quick look at senate
 
01:20:40.790 --> 01:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
bill 53
 
01:20:43.669 --> 01:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
and senate bill bill 53 seems to address
 
01:20:44.950 --> 01:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
the conflict of interest of
 
01:20:47.189 --> 01:20:47.199 align:start position:0%
confidentiality of the drv through
 
01:20:47.199 --> 01:20:49.430 align:start position:0%
confidentiality of the drv through
statute

01:20:49.430 --> 01:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:20:51.510 --> 01:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
as opposed to creating a board to do
 
01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:54.390 align:start position:0%
as opposed to creating a board to do
that

01:20:54.390 --> 01:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:57.189 --> 01:20:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:58.830 --> 01:20:58.840 align:start position:0%
would that be a
 
01:21:03.350 --> 01:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:05.189 --> 01:21:05.199 align:start position:0%
again i didn't
 
01:21:07.430 --> 01:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
i wasn't part of writing of of either of
 
01:21:09.669 --> 01:21:09.679 align:start position:0%
these bills
 
01:21:12.790 --> 01:21:12.800 align:start position:0%
my understanding of it it does address
 
01:21:14.550 --> 01:21:14.560 align:start position:0%
the confidentiality
 
01:21:17.590 --> 01:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
issue i do believe there is not the only
 
01:21:20.550 --> 01:21:20.560 align:start position:0%
issue i believe that
 
01:21:22.310 --> 01:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
one of the other concerns that people
 
01:21:25.030 --> 01:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
have had about the dra
 
01:21:26.870 --> 01:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
being the licensing board or the
 
01:21:29.110 --> 01:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
certification board is that they're also
 
01:21:32.149 --> 01:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
certifying their own employees
 
01:21:34.390 --> 01:21:34.400 align:start position:0%
that would that particular bill would
 
01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:36.390 align:start position:0%
that would that particular bill would
not

01:21:36.390 --> 01:21:36.400 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:21:40.310 --> 01:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:42.149 --> 01:21:42.159 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair but you did say
 
01:21:44.870 --> 01:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
you would support senate bill 53 and you
 
01:21:46.709 --> 01:21:46.719 align:start position:0%
have no position on this one
 
01:21:48.470 --> 01:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
that is correct
 
01:21:50.070 --> 01:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
last question so i'm trying to
 
01:21:53.030 --> 01:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
understand why that is
 
01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:57.669 align:start position:0%
understand why that is
well

01:21:57.669 --> 01:21:57.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:59.430 --> 01:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
personally i have no issue with the
 
01:22:00.950 --> 01:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
department of revenue
 
01:22:03.110 --> 01:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
it's a person more personal and you know
 
01:22:07.510 --> 01:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:09.750 --> 01:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
i understand some of the issues that
 
01:22:12.310 --> 01:22:12.320 align:start position:0%
others are bringing up
 
01:22:14.790 --> 01:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
but to me whether i'm being certified by
 
01:22:16.790 --> 01:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
the department of revenue administration
 
01:22:19.189 --> 01:22:19.199 align:start position:0%
or licensing board
 
01:22:21.990 --> 01:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
it's not going to impact me directly
 
01:22:24.390 --> 01:22:24.400 align:start position:0%
therefore that's the reason i'm just
 
01:22:27.189 --> 01:22:27.199 align:start position:0%
i'm neutral on this bill
 
01:22:30.229 --> 01:22:30.239 align:start position:0%
thank you okay other questions
 
01:22:31.750 --> 01:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
 
01:22:36.390 --> 01:22:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:08.390 --> 01:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
lori ordolano um
 
01:23:10.229 --> 01:23:10.239 align:start position:0%
i don't know if i'm the only citizen
 
01:23:12.470 --> 01:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
speaking today as a citizen on this
 
01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:13.910 align:start position:0%
speaking today as a citizen on this
issue

01:23:13.910 --> 01:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:23:17.030 --> 01:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
i live in nashua and i'm um providing
 
01:23:20.149 --> 01:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
testimony in support of creating this
 
01:23:22.950 --> 01:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
certification or this discipline and
 
01:23:25.590 --> 01:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
certification board for
 
01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:28.709 align:start position:0%
certification board for
assessors

01:23:28.709 --> 01:23:28.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:30.390 --> 01:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
mr gagne
 
01:23:32.550 --> 01:23:32.560 align:start position:0%
indicated that there was some citizen
 
01:23:34.229 --> 01:23:34.239 align:start position:0%
support and
 
01:23:37.750 --> 01:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
citizen concerns at addressing this and
 
01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:43.750 --> 01:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has a very high reliance
 
01:23:45.590 --> 01:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
on property tax
 
01:23:47.030 --> 01:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
to fund the government and these
 
01:23:49.510 --> 01:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
assessors play a critical role
 
01:23:52.229 --> 01:23:52.239 align:start position:0%
in creating fair and equitable
 
01:23:52.239 --> 01:23:53.590 align:start position:0%
in creating fair and equitable
assessments

01:23:53.590 --> 01:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
assessments
 
01:23:58.070 --> 01:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:00.149 --> 01:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
when the department of revenue is the
 
01:24:04.790 --> 01:24:04.800 align:start position:0%
agency that is providing the review
 
01:24:07.430 --> 01:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
of these assessors and handling the
 
01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:10.149 align:start position:0%
of these assessors and handling the
complaints

01:24:10.149 --> 01:24:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:12.629 --> 01:24:12.639 align:start position:0%
it presents a potential conflict of
 
01:24:12.639 --> 01:24:14.629 align:start position:0%
it presents a potential conflict of
interest

01:24:14.629 --> 01:24:14.639 align:start position:0%
interest
 
01:24:16.310 --> 01:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
in the second issue you heard was that
 
01:24:18.229 --> 01:24:18.239 align:start position:0%
these complaints were being maintained
 
01:24:21.189 --> 01:24:21.199 align:start position:0%
confidentiality in confidentiality um
 
01:24:23.030 --> 01:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
not released to the public and senate
 
01:24:25.350 --> 01:24:25.360 align:start position:0%
bill 53 will take care of that and i'm
 
01:24:27.510 --> 01:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
in full support of that
 
01:24:28.870 --> 01:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
you know i'd like to speak to some of
 
01:24:30.790 --> 01:24:30.800 align:start position:0%
the questions i heard raised here as a
 
01:24:32.870 --> 01:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
citizen because i feel i'm more free to
 
01:24:34.709 --> 01:24:34.719 align:start position:0%
speak to them
 
01:24:34.719 --> 01:24:35.750 align:start position:0%
speak to them
one

01:24:35.750 --> 01:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:24:37.750 --> 01:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
member asked you know could you give me
 
01:24:40.950 --> 01:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
a candid reason why this is being done
 
01:24:42.629 --> 01:24:42.639 align:start position:0%
and i think the candid reason is you
 
01:24:45.669 --> 01:24:45.679 align:start position:0%
have the fox guarding the hen house here
 
01:24:49.189 --> 01:24:49.199 align:start position:0%
when the dra serves as the agency for
 
01:24:49.199 --> 01:24:51.270 align:start position:0%
when the dra serves as the agency for
oversight

01:24:51.270 --> 01:24:51.280 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
01:24:53.430 --> 01:24:53.440 align:start position:0%
alone without
 
01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:54.870 align:start position:0%
alone without
assessors

01:24:54.870 --> 01:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
assessors
 
01:24:57.669 --> 01:24:57.679 align:start position:0%
they have assessors who work for them
 
01:24:59.350 --> 01:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
under their control under their
 
01:25:01.590 --> 01:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
leadership under their management
 
01:25:03.830 --> 01:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
the formal complaint process for
 
01:25:06.070 --> 01:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
bringing a complaint against an assessor
 
01:25:09.110 --> 01:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
is called a pa 71 form can be filled out
 
01:25:11.350 --> 01:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
by any citizen who wants to raise a
 
01:25:13.510 --> 01:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
complaint to the dra regarding an
 
01:25:15.990 --> 01:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
assessor most of them in a municipality
 
01:25:17.830 --> 01:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
but if you raise that a complaint
 
01:25:21.270 --> 01:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
against an internal assessor at the dra
 
01:25:24.070 --> 01:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
now the dra has to look at the internal
 
01:25:27.669 --> 01:25:27.679 align:start position:0%
assessors work that they were overseeing
 
01:25:29.430 --> 01:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
and make a judgment on whether they were
 
01:25:34.870 --> 01:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:36.149 align:start position:0%
 
chairman

01:25:36.149 --> 01:25:36.159 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:25:38.070 --> 01:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
gagne mentioned that there's a potential
 
01:25:40.950 --> 01:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest here i agree
 
01:25:44.149 --> 01:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
by setting up the oplc board
 
01:25:46.709 --> 01:25:46.719 align:start position:0%
and setting it up to have citizens
 
01:25:49.270 --> 01:25:49.280 align:start position:0%
assessors and a rep and the commissioner
 
01:25:52.070 --> 01:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
of the dra or a designee you have a more
 
01:25:56.550 --> 01:25:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:58.149 --> 01:25:58.159 align:start position:0%
one gentleman
 
01:25:59.910 --> 01:25:59.920 align:start position:0%
mr bartlett who just spoke mentioned he
 
01:26:02.550 --> 01:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
was concerned about board balance
 
01:26:04.629 --> 01:26:04.639 align:start position:0%
too many citizens
 
01:26:06.390 --> 01:26:06.400 align:start position:0%
if i read the bill correctly one of
 
01:26:08.310 --> 01:26:08.320 align:start position:0%
those citizens could have an assessing
 
01:26:10.390 --> 01:26:10.400 align:start position:0%
background or have a background in
 
01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:12.629 align:start position:0%
background or have a background in
appraising

01:26:12.629 --> 01:26:12.639 align:start position:0%
appraising
 
01:26:15.270 --> 01:26:15.280 align:start position:0%
so as it stands now it's a seven-member
 
01:26:18.149 --> 01:26:18.159 align:start position:0%
board four could be and would be
 
01:26:20.790 --> 01:26:20.800 align:start position:0%
associated with some um or have
 
01:26:22.790 --> 01:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
knowledge of assessing two of the
 
01:26:25.189 --> 01:26:25.199 align:start position:0%
citizens may potentially not
 
01:26:28.229 --> 01:26:28.239 align:start position:0%
i don't consider that too unbalanced
 
01:26:30.550 --> 01:26:30.560 align:start position:0%
as it stands now the 15-member board of
 
01:26:33.189 --> 01:26:33.199 align:start position:0%
the assessing standards board the asb
 
01:26:35.030 --> 01:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
pretty large
 
01:26:36.870 --> 01:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't want to keep it under that
 
01:26:39.350 --> 01:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
board at that size because i think it's
 
01:26:41.910 --> 01:26:41.920 align:start position:0%
too big a board i like consolidating it
 
01:26:44.070 --> 01:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
down to a seven member board i think
 
01:26:46.629 --> 01:26:46.639 align:start position:0%
it's more effective now as it stands now
 
01:26:48.470 --> 01:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
there are only three citizens on that
 
01:26:51.189 --> 01:26:51.199 align:start position:0%
15-member board one seat's been vacant
 
01:26:54.149 --> 01:26:54.159 align:start position:0%
for three years maybe going on four
 
01:26:56.629 --> 01:26:56.639 align:start position:0%
you know i myself and other people have
 
01:26:58.709 --> 01:26:58.719 align:start position:0%
argued for a while that there are not
 
01:27:00.149 --> 01:27:00.159 align:start position:0%
enough citizens
 
01:27:02.310 --> 01:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
on that board that board was really set
 
01:27:05.350 --> 01:27:05.360 align:start position:0%
up to be a more balanced board
 
01:27:07.590 --> 01:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
overseeing and providing input on
 
01:27:09.830 --> 01:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
certification of assessors
 
01:27:12.470 --> 01:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
allowing the public to have a a a part
 
01:27:15.110 --> 01:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
of it and and assessors as well and
 
01:27:18.149 --> 01:27:18.159 align:start position:0%
municipalities and the public ended up
 
01:27:20.390 --> 01:27:20.400 align:start position:0%
playing a pretty small role and right
 
01:27:22.870 --> 01:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
now it's two public members to 14
 
01:27:24.550 --> 01:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
committee members and i think the public
 
01:27:27.590 --> 01:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
voice there is is too small
 
01:27:29.189 --> 01:27:29.199 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:27:30.550 --> 01:27:30.560 align:start position:0%
so i think the balance in what's
 
01:27:32.629 --> 01:27:32.639 align:start position:0%
proposed on this board is
 
01:27:34.070 --> 01:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
is pretty good
 
01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:40.870 align:start position:0%
is pretty good
um

01:27:40.870 --> 01:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:43.590 --> 01:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
i think by creating so i'm not certain
 
01:27:45.669 --> 01:27:45.679 align:start position:0%
that i i think that this needs to stay
 
01:27:49.350 --> 01:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
with the asb the asb can serves as an
 
01:27:51.430 --> 01:27:51.440 align:start position:0%
arm of the dra
 
01:27:53.590 --> 01:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
creating all of these regulations for
 
01:27:56.390 --> 01:27:56.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities less focused on the
 
01:27:58.709 --> 01:27:58.719 align:start position:0%
individual assessor when there is an
 
01:28:00.950 --> 01:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
individual assessor issue it goes to the
 
01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:02.870 align:start position:0%
individual assessor issue it goes to the
dra

01:28:02.870 --> 01:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
dra
 
01:28:05.430 --> 01:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
but the dra operates on their own
 
01:28:08.070 --> 01:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
outside of any oversight at all
 
01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:11.030 align:start position:0%
outside of any oversight at all
um

01:28:11.030 --> 01:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:14.149 --> 01:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
an interesting thing is the oplc handles
 
01:28:16.870 --> 01:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
certification for appraisers there are a
 
01:28:18.229 --> 01:28:18.239 align:start position:0%
number of
 
01:28:18.239 --> 01:28:19.430 align:start position:0%
number of
um

01:28:19.430 --> 01:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:21.270 --> 01:28:21.280 align:start position:0%
municipalities that have certified
 
01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:22.629 align:start position:0%
municipalities that have certified
appraisers

01:28:22.629 --> 01:28:22.639 align:start position:0%
appraisers
 
01:28:24.629 --> 01:28:24.639 align:start position:0%
in their city government we have one in
 
01:28:27.030 --> 01:28:27.040 align:start position:0%
nashua um
 
01:28:28.390 --> 01:28:28.400 align:start position:0%
if you have an a
 
01:28:30.229 --> 01:28:30.239 align:start position:0%
if i had a complaint against that
 
01:28:32.870 --> 01:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
appraiser slash assessor and i filed
 
01:28:35.430 --> 01:28:35.440 align:start position:0%
that complaint it would go to the oplc
 
01:28:37.669 --> 01:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
if it was found justified it would be
 
01:28:40.229 --> 01:28:40.239 align:start position:0%
released publicly so right now the
 
01:28:43.350 --> 01:28:43.360 align:start position:0%
appraisers in municipalities will have
 
01:28:45.189 --> 01:28:45.199 align:start position:0%
any disciplinary action that was
 
01:28:47.510 --> 01:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
actually taken against them a part of
 
01:28:49.990 --> 01:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
public record but those that are not
 
01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:51.270 align:start position:0%
public record but those that are not
licensed

01:28:51.270 --> 01:28:51.280 align:start position:0%
licensed
 
01:28:53.030 --> 01:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
appraisers and are only certified
 
01:28:53.040 --> 01:28:54.070 align:start position:0%
appraisers and are only certified
assessors

01:28:54.070 --> 01:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
assessors
 
01:28:56.790 --> 01:28:56.800 align:start position:0%
are allowed to maintain confidentiality
 
01:28:58.310 --> 01:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
of those issues
 
01:29:01.270 --> 01:29:01.280 align:start position:0%
and i am a person who filed pa-71s down
 
01:29:04.390 --> 01:29:04.400 align:start position:0%
in nashua against several assessors
 
01:29:06.149 --> 01:29:06.159 align:start position:0%
sanctions were found
 
01:29:09.510 --> 01:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
and shockingly to me when i read the rsa
 
01:29:11.350 --> 01:29:11.360 align:start position:0%
i thought
 
01:29:13.830 --> 01:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
i'm just a citizen i thought they were
 
01:29:17.270 --> 01:29:17.280 align:start position:0%
going to be public the dr the asb board
 
01:29:19.189 --> 01:29:19.199 align:start position:0%
thought and believed at that time that
 
01:29:21.430 --> 01:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
they were public nobody really realized
 
01:29:23.350 --> 01:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
they weren't public until i had kind of
 
01:29:24.790 --> 01:29:24.800 align:start position:0%
pushed the issue
 
01:29:25.990 --> 01:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:29:28.070 --> 01:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
i learned that they couldn't be released
 
01:29:31.350 --> 01:29:31.360 align:start position:0%
the dra sent me a nameless sheet
 
01:29:33.750 --> 01:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
of all of the infractions they found
 
01:29:35.189 --> 01:29:35.199 align:start position:0%
that had occurred
 
01:29:37.110 --> 01:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
but they wouldn't identify who they were
 
01:29:38.470 --> 01:29:38.480 align:start position:0%
applied to
 
01:29:41.430 --> 01:29:41.440 align:start position:0%
i knew who i had submitted my pa 71s
 
01:29:44.390 --> 01:29:44.400 align:start position:0%
against and i could track my claims
 
01:29:46.229 --> 01:29:46.239 align:start position:0%
versus what was found
 
01:29:48.229 --> 01:29:48.239 align:start position:0%
but i really didn't have a right to make
 
01:29:49.830 --> 01:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
it a public record
 
01:29:51.350 --> 01:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
i couldn't say that i discovered
 
01:29:53.590 --> 01:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
anything and when those sanctions came
 
01:29:55.990 --> 01:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
out our mayor of the city announced that
 
01:29:59.189 --> 01:29:59.199 align:start position:0%
they were minuscule issues insignificant
 
01:30:03.110 --> 01:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
and not important just brush them off as
 
01:30:05.750 --> 01:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
some lady complaining about nothing
 
01:30:08.070 --> 01:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
how dare she
 
01:30:11.590 --> 01:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
so um i was so disappointed that two
 
01:30:14.229 --> 01:30:14.239 align:start position:0%
years of work to try and validate that
 
01:30:16.310 --> 01:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
things weren't right in an office got
 
01:30:20.390 --> 01:30:20.400 align:start position:0%
swept under the rug by the municipality
 
01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:24.390 align:start position:0%
swept under the rug by the municipality
um

01:30:24.390 --> 01:30:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:26.470 --> 01:30:26.480 align:start position:0%
that the items that uh mr bartlett
 
01:30:28.390 --> 01:30:28.400 align:start position:0%
brought up i think they're reason you
 
01:30:30.229 --> 01:30:30.239 align:start position:0%
know reasonable i would
 
01:30:32.149 --> 01:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
i would say you know i would like this
 
01:30:34.390 --> 01:30:34.400 align:start position:0%
not to be killed i'd like it to be
 
01:30:36.709 --> 01:30:36.719 align:start position:0%
studied further if that's what it needs
 
01:30:39.669 --> 01:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
and and tweaked as far as you know all
 
01:30:42.550 --> 01:30:42.560 align:start position:0%
assessors becoming decertified instantly
 
01:30:44.470 --> 01:30:44.480 align:start position:0%
well let's put a grandfather clause in
 
01:30:47.110 --> 01:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
there you know this isn't rocket science
 
01:30:49.189 --> 01:30:49.199 align:start position:0%
here we've started other
 
01:30:50.790 --> 01:30:50.800 align:start position:0%
oversight groups that have been part of
 
01:30:53.430 --> 01:30:53.440 align:start position:0%
the oplc and there's a startup mechanism
 
01:30:55.270 --> 01:30:55.280 align:start position:0%
and let's make certain that language is
 
01:30:57.030 --> 01:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
folded into our bill
 
01:30:57.040 --> 01:30:58.310 align:start position:0%
folded into our bill
um

01:30:58.310 --> 01:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:01.350 --> 01:31:01.360 align:start position:0%
and let's you know clarify the assessors
 
01:31:04.149 --> 01:31:04.159 align:start position:0%
who are on that board to look at
 
01:31:06.550 --> 01:31:06.560 align:start position:0%
complaints or certification that comes
 
01:31:06.560 --> 01:31:08.709 align:start position:0%
complaints or certification that comes
forward

01:31:08.709 --> 01:31:08.719 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:31:11.510 --> 01:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
i think it's very important so
 
01:31:13.510 --> 01:31:13.520 align:start position:0%
i very much support this and i support
 
01:31:14.950 --> 01:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
it as a citizen
 
01:31:17.510 --> 01:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
not tippy-toeing around the fact that
 
01:31:19.990 --> 01:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
the dra has my certification and i have
 
01:31:21.669 --> 01:31:21.679 align:start position:0%
to be careful about what i say but i
 
01:31:23.750 --> 01:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
really think you have the fox guarding
 
01:31:25.510 --> 01:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
the hen house here and you need to
 
01:31:27.510 --> 01:31:27.520 align:start position:0%
broaden that a little bit
 
01:31:28.950 --> 01:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:31:31.110 --> 01:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien here raised a
 
01:31:33.270 --> 01:31:33.280 align:start position:0%
very very valid point you know people
 
01:31:35.110 --> 01:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
complain all the time about assessors
 
01:31:37.270 --> 01:31:37.280 align:start position:0%
how do we protect them we protect them
 
01:31:40.070 --> 01:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
by only releasing information that is
 
01:31:41.910 --> 01:31:41.920 align:start position:0%
actually a sanction
 
01:31:43.990 --> 01:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
the ones that are not found valid should
 
01:31:47.590 --> 01:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
nev will never be released it should not
 
01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:48.709 align:start position:0%
nev will never be released it should not
so

01:31:48.709 --> 01:31:48.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:31:54.310 --> 01:31:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:55.830 --> 01:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony are there
 
01:31:59.510 --> 01:31:59.520 align:start position:0%

01:32:04.470 --> 01:32:04.480 align:start position:0%
something with it
 
01:32:08.310 --> 01:32:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:12.229 --> 01:32:12.239 align:start position:0%

01:34:37.430 --> 01:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
01:34:39.270 --> 01:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
this bill is being presented as amended
 
01:34:40.790 --> 01:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
by the health and human services
 
01:34:42.709 --> 01:34:42.719 align:start position:0%
committee it was originally presented
 
01:34:44.390 --> 01:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
last session
 
01:34:46.070 --> 01:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
and was actually a much bigger bill than
 
01:34:47.910 --> 01:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
this however it was retained and
 
01:34:50.390 --> 01:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
thankfully assigned to a subcommittee
 
01:34:53.109 --> 01:34:53.119 align:start position:0%
i worked with that subcommittee and
 
01:34:54.870 --> 01:34:54.880 align:start position:0%
we came to an agreement to keep the most
 
01:34:56.870 --> 01:34:56.880 align:start position:0%
important part of the bill through an
 
01:34:59.590 --> 01:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
amendment this agreement was bipartisan
 
01:35:01.910 --> 01:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
and unanimous in the subcommittee
 
01:35:03.350 --> 01:35:03.360 align:start position:0%
in which the subcommittee brought the
 
01:35:04.870 --> 01:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
amended bill to the committee it was
 
01:35:07.270 --> 01:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
passed unanimously and placed on the
 
01:35:09.590 --> 01:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
consent calendar and now we're here for
 
01:35:11.430 --> 01:35:11.440 align:start position:0%
our second committee hearing
 
01:35:13.030 --> 01:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
in the house
 
01:35:14.550 --> 01:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
what we've done is we've narrowed this
 
01:35:16.470 --> 01:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
bill down to
 
01:35:18.470 --> 01:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
to allow an increase in the amount of
 
01:35:22.950 --> 01:35:22.960 align:start position:0%
gross sales for homestead goods produced
 
01:35:25.030 --> 01:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
by homesteaders from twenty thousand
 
01:35:27.510 --> 01:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
dollars to thirty five thousand dollars
 
01:35:30.550 --> 01:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
we felt that at this time
 
01:35:32.229 --> 01:35:32.239 align:start position:0%
time meaning over the past few years
 
01:35:32.239 --> 01:35:33.189 align:start position:0%
time meaning over the past few years
that

01:35:33.189 --> 01:35:33.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:35:35.109 --> 01:35:35.119 align:start position:0%
homesteaders have suffered greatly
 
01:35:37.270 --> 01:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
particularly during the pandemic
 
01:35:38.870 --> 01:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
when sales were stifled because of
 
01:35:41.109 --> 01:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
farmer market shutdowns
 
01:35:43.430 --> 01:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
and when farm stands were not visited by
 
01:35:44.950 --> 01:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
customers due to either a coveted
 
01:35:46.870 --> 01:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
restriction or safety needs our
 
01:35:49.669 --> 01:35:49.679 align:start position:0%
homestead vendors lost out
 
01:35:51.189 --> 01:35:51.199 align:start position:0%
goods that had been prepared for sale
 
01:35:53.189 --> 01:35:53.199 align:start position:0%
were discarded
 
01:35:55.189 --> 01:35:55.199 align:start position:0%
no new sales were achieved in numerous
 
01:35:55.199 --> 01:35:56.470 align:start position:0%
no new sales were achieved in numerous
cases

01:35:56.470 --> 01:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
cases
 
01:35:58.229 --> 01:35:58.239 align:start position:0%
and now that we're rolling along in our
 
01:36:00.709 --> 01:36:00.719 align:start position:0%
economy the price and expense
 
01:36:02.470 --> 01:36:02.480 align:start position:0%
of these products that it takes for a
 
01:36:04.470 --> 01:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
homestead vendor to even make their
 
01:36:06.149 --> 01:36:06.159 align:start position:0%
goods at home
 
01:36:09.350 --> 01:36:09.360 align:start position:0%
have now been inflated by 200 to 300
 
01:36:11.830 --> 01:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
percent in some cases
 
01:36:14.070 --> 01:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
that leaves the net profit much less
 
01:36:16.070 --> 01:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
than ever before
 
01:36:18.390 --> 01:36:18.400 align:start position:0%
many homestead kitchens
 
01:36:20.390 --> 01:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
their sales are a great supplement to
 
01:36:21.910 --> 01:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
the households
 
01:36:23.750 --> 01:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
of these folks they depend on the sales
 
01:36:26.310 --> 01:36:26.320 align:start position:0%
to add to their income the products they
 
01:36:28.950 --> 01:36:28.960 align:start position:0%
sell are potentially non-hazardous goods
 
01:36:30.310 --> 01:36:30.320 align:start position:0%
and are regulated by the department of
 
01:36:32.070 --> 01:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
health and human services
 
01:36:34.550 --> 01:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
nothing in this amended bill changes any
 
01:36:36.470 --> 01:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
of that we're only changing the gross
 
01:36:38.550 --> 01:36:38.560 align:start position:0%
sales amount
 
01:36:39.750 --> 01:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
we would like to be able to give the
 
01:36:42.149 --> 01:36:42.159 align:start position:0%
homestead community some coveted relief
 
01:36:44.070 --> 01:36:44.080 align:start position:0%
or economic relief either way you want
 
01:36:45.669 --> 01:36:45.679 align:start position:0%
to go with it
 
01:36:47.270 --> 01:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
to help get them back to where they were
 
01:36:49.510 --> 01:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
and to help to afford for them to afford
 
01:36:51.590 --> 01:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
to create the products that they make
 
01:36:53.189 --> 01:36:53.199 align:start position:0%
and still be able to make a meager
 
01:36:54.790 --> 01:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
amount for those sales
 
01:36:57.270 --> 01:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
i asked the committee to consider this
 
01:36:59.030 --> 01:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
bill and vote for the auto pass as
 
01:37:00.790 --> 01:37:00.800 align:start position:0%
amended so that we can
 
01:37:03.430 --> 01:37:03.440 align:start position:0%
move this bill onto the next phase
 
01:37:04.950 --> 01:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
with our friends from the other body
 
01:37:06.870 --> 01:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
let's let's help our homesteaders i'm
 
01:37:08.709 --> 01:37:08.719 align:start position:0%
more than willing to take any questions
 
01:37:11.270 --> 01:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
well thank you i have a question do you
 
01:37:13.669 --> 01:37:13.679 align:start position:0%
know at what date the twenty thousand
 
01:37:15.990 --> 01:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
dollar exemption was put into law i do
 
01:37:18.070 --> 01:37:18.080 align:start position:0%
not know madam chair uh thank you for
 
01:37:19.350 --> 01:37:19.360 align:start position:0%
the question i do not know the exact
 
01:37:21.590 --> 01:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
date but it was many years ago
 
01:37:23.270 --> 01:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
and this this bill
 
01:37:25.830 --> 01:37:25.840 align:start position:0%
of similar bills uh even for this amount
 
01:37:28.149 --> 01:37:28.159 align:start position:0%
have come up several times in the past
 
01:37:30.229 --> 01:37:30.239 align:start position:0%
and haven't been able to quite make it
 
01:37:32.310 --> 01:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
through the process i'm hoping that
 
01:37:34.470 --> 01:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
we'll understand that
 
01:37:36.709 --> 01:37:36.719 align:start position:0%
prices go up and
 
01:37:39.430 --> 01:37:39.440 align:start position:0%
and these folks need to be able to
 
01:37:42.550 --> 01:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
adjust with the times
 
01:37:44.470 --> 01:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:37:47.030 --> 01:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
01:38:02.470 --> 01:38:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:04.310 --> 01:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i guess the
 
01:38:06.709 --> 01:38:06.719 align:start position:0%
question is more to you as to
 
01:38:08.229 --> 01:38:08.239 align:start position:0%
why is this bill before the committee
 
01:38:09.750 --> 01:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
what are we reviewing
 
01:38:09.760 --> 01:38:10.550 align:start position:0%
what are we reviewing
uh

01:38:10.550 --> 01:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:38:13.350 --> 01:38:13.360 align:start position:0%
actually i believe it came to us from
 
01:38:15.590 --> 01:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
its original
 
01:38:19.750 --> 01:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
incarnation as a major licensing issue
 
01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:20.709 align:start position:0%
incarnation as a major licensing issue
but

01:38:20.709 --> 01:38:20.719 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:38:22.470 --> 01:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
and i didn't catch it in time when it
 
01:38:24.310 --> 01:38:24.320 align:start position:0%
passed the house that had been amended
 
01:38:25.590 --> 01:38:25.600 align:start position:0%
such that it's
 
01:38:27.830 --> 01:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
really not our bailiwick
 
01:38:32.310 --> 01:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:33.990 --> 01:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
and the fellow
 
01:38:36.149 --> 01:38:36.159 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair my my only
 
01:38:39.830 --> 01:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:43.270 --> 01:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:44.870 --> 01:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
i just want to get a sense of like
 
01:38:47.430 --> 01:38:47.440 align:start position:0%
what's covered and not covered because
 
01:38:50.070 --> 01:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
it says some foods are excluded because
 
01:38:53.109 --> 01:38:53.119 align:start position:0%
they're potentially hazardous so i'm
 
01:38:55.430 --> 01:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
thinking of the things i might see
 
01:38:58.470 --> 01:38:58.480 align:start position:0%
at the farmer's market
 
01:39:01.189 --> 01:39:01.199 align:start position:0%
uh representative fellows that's
 
01:39:03.510 --> 01:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
that's the current law and the current
 
01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:04.950 align:start position:0%
that's the current law and the current
definitions

01:39:04.950 --> 01:39:04.960 align:start position:0%
definitions
 
01:39:04.960 --> 01:39:05.990 align:start position:0%
definitions
and

01:39:05.990 --> 01:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:39:08.629 --> 01:39:08.639 align:start position:0%
this bill does nothing to change it
 
01:39:10.709 --> 01:39:10.719 align:start position:0%
and i believe the current the hazardous
 
01:39:15.189 --> 01:39:15.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:18.390 --> 01:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
hazardous food yeah well raw fish i
 
01:39:20.390 --> 01:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
think are qualified
 
01:39:23.910 --> 01:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:25.669 --> 01:39:25.679 align:start position:0%
madam chair do you want me to to speak
 
01:39:27.910 --> 01:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:31.510 --> 01:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
if you like briefly real real quickly um
 
01:39:34.149 --> 01:39:34.159 align:start position:0%
there there is a difference hhs a
 
01:39:37.270 --> 01:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
website has a list of the potentially
 
01:39:39.350 --> 01:39:39.360 align:start position:0%
hazardous and non-hazardous foods there
 
01:39:41.830 --> 01:39:41.840 align:start position:0%
i didn't include it in with this because
 
01:39:44.070 --> 01:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
the bill is amendment amended no longer
 
01:39:46.070 --> 01:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
talks about any of that we're only
 
01:39:50.550 --> 01:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:53.030 --> 01:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
representative marsh and then shut
 
01:39:54.709 --> 01:39:54.719 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair i just wanted
 
01:39:56.390 --> 01:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
to point out that food protection comes
 
01:39:58.149 --> 01:39:58.159 align:start position:0%
under the baileywick of the hhs
 
01:40:00.390 --> 01:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
committee and this was discussed quite
 
01:40:01.830 --> 01:40:01.840 align:start position:0%
extensively in the prior hearing and
 
01:40:04.149 --> 01:40:04.159 align:start position:0%
really doesn't come in our jurisdiction
 
01:40:05.750 --> 01:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
so thank you for that
 
01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:07.510 align:start position:0%
so thank you for that
representative

01:40:07.510 --> 01:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:40:09.669 --> 01:40:09.679 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair this is probably
 
01:40:12.310 --> 01:40:12.320 align:start position:0%
more for you also
 
01:40:14.709 --> 01:40:14.719 align:start position:0%
this seems to be now a matter since
 
01:40:16.550 --> 01:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
health and human services
 
01:40:19.189 --> 01:40:19.199 align:start position:0%
was the original committee uh it seems
 
01:40:22.629 --> 01:40:22.639 align:start position:0%
more a matter of the amount involved
 
01:40:24.229 --> 01:40:24.239 align:start position:0%
which seems like it should have gone to
 
01:40:25.830 --> 01:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
ways and means is there some way we
 
01:40:27.910 --> 01:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
could involve it is no it would not go
 
01:40:29.750 --> 01:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
to ways and means
 
01:40:31.270 --> 01:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
it's not a
 
01:40:33.109 --> 01:40:33.119 align:start position:0%
this is a
 
01:40:35.750 --> 01:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
raising the threshold
 
01:40:38.070 --> 01:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
under which one is exempt from the
 
01:40:39.990 --> 01:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
licensing requirement
 
01:40:42.070 --> 01:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
it doesn't change what the licensing
 
01:40:44.950 --> 01:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
requirement is it just says
 
01:40:46.950 --> 01:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
under these this sales level you don't
 
01:40:49.990 --> 01:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
have to to get licensed thank you so it
 
01:40:52.550 --> 01:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
is sort of a licensing issue madam sure
 
01:40:55.990 --> 01:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
that's exactly correct the the licensing
 
01:40:58.229 --> 01:40:58.239 align:start position:0%
homesteaders are allowed to prepare from

about 50 000 but uh realize that a
 
01:42:02.550 --> 01:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
seventy five percent increase on twenty
 
01:42:03.990 --> 01:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
thousand even though through
 
01:42:05.590 --> 01:42:05.600 align:start position:0%

like the elimination of the
 
03:01:16.630 --> 03:01:16.640 align:start position:0%
sprinkler requirements for one and two
 
03:01:19.190 --> 03:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
family homes and other issues that are
 
03:01:21.990 --> 03:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
unique to new hampshire
 
03:01:25.190 --> 03:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
i will there are a couple of other items
 
03:01:27.349 --> 03:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
for example um
 
03:01:29.510 --> 03:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
where are we at there
 
03:01:29.520 --> 03:01:30.950 align:start position:0%
where are we at there
section

03:01:30.950 --> 03:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
section
 
03:01:32.870 --> 03:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
section four
 
03:01:34.950 --> 03:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
says that if you apply for a building
 
03:01:34.960 --> 03:01:35.990 align:start position:0%
says that if you apply for a building
permit

03:01:35.990 --> 03:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
permit
 
03:01:37.670 --> 03:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
at the time the
 
03:01:40.309 --> 03:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
the building code is changing
 
03:01:42.630 --> 03:01:42.640 align:start position:0%
you can use either
 
03:01:45.429 --> 03:01:45.439 align:start position:0%
the old or the new plan as long as you
 
03:01:45.439 --> 03:01:47.110 align:start position:0%
the old or the new plan as long as you
tell

03:01:47.110 --> 03:01:47.120 align:start position:0%
tell
 
03:01:48.790 --> 03:01:48.800 align:start position:0%
tell your
 
03:01:50.790 --> 03:01:50.800 align:start position:0%
um whoever's granting your building
 
03:01:54.550 --> 03:01:54.560 align:start position:0%
permit which version you're using
 
03:01:56.150 --> 03:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
and you have to meet all the
 
03:01:57.830 --> 03:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
requirements of that code so you can
 
03:02:00.309 --> 03:02:00.319 align:start position:0%
either design your building for the
 
03:02:02.870 --> 03:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
up-to-date more up-to-date version or
 
03:02:04.550 --> 03:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
stick with the older one
 
03:02:07.670 --> 03:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
your choice but you have to decide and
 
03:02:09.910 --> 03:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
you have to say so
 
03:02:12.150 --> 03:02:12.160 align:start position:0%
uh that was a request of the builders
 
03:02:14.070 --> 03:02:14.080 align:start position:0%
who say that well you do we spend a lot
 
03:02:16.550 --> 03:02:16.560 align:start position:0%
of time designing and working on it
 
03:02:19.269 --> 03:02:19.279 align:start position:0%
and the building permit may not be
 
03:02:19.279 --> 03:02:20.389 align:start position:0%
and the building permit may not be
pulled

03:02:20.389 --> 03:02:20.399 align:start position:0%
pulled
 
03:02:22.950 --> 03:02:22.960 align:start position:0%
until just before you start construction
 
03:02:25.590 --> 03:02:25.600 align:start position:0%
and so you wouldn't want to have to
 
03:02:27.670 --> 03:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
go back and completely redo your plans
 
03:02:29.990 --> 03:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
as a result of a code change when you're
 
03:02:32.870 --> 03:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
90 of the way through
 
03:02:36.230 --> 03:02:36.240 align:start position:0%
all right what else is there
 
03:02:39.349 --> 03:02:39.359 align:start position:0%
section not 11 which starts on
 
03:02:42.309 --> 03:02:42.319 align:start position:0%
line 17 on page 2
 
03:02:44.790 --> 03:02:44.800 align:start position:0%
incorporates the
 
03:02:47.590 --> 03:02:47.600 align:start position:0%
uh relaxation of the arc fault
 
03:02:47.600 --> 03:02:48.870 align:start position:0%
uh relaxation of the arc fault
requirements

03:02:48.870 --> 03:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
03:02:51.510 --> 03:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
that we adopted i think was three years
 
03:02:51.520 --> 03:02:52.710 align:start position:0%
that we adopted i think was three years
ago

03:02:52.710 --> 03:02:52.720 align:start position:0%
ago
 
03:02:57.030 --> 03:02:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:59.990 --> 03:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
it keeps us from having unnecessary arc
 
03:03:00.000 --> 03:03:01.990 align:start position:0%
it keeps us from having unnecessary arc
fault

03:03:01.990 --> 03:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
fault
 
03:03:04.710 --> 03:03:04.720 align:start position:0%
circuits that would trip unnecessarily
 
03:03:09.110 --> 03:03:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:11.349 --> 03:03:11.359 align:start position:0%
a great inconvenience to people that are
 
03:03:13.910 --> 03:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
powering major medical devices on on
 
03:03:15.510 --> 03:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
those circuits
 
03:03:18.550 --> 03:03:18.560 align:start position:0%
but we approved that change
 
03:03:24.150 --> 03:03:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:28.870 --> 03:03:28.880 align:start position:0%
section six says that
 
03:03:31.269 --> 03:03:31.279 align:start position:0%
local legislative changes to the
 
03:03:33.349 --> 03:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
building code for their town
 
03:03:34.389 --> 03:03:34.399 align:start position:0%
shall be
 
03:03:36.230 --> 03:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
submitted to the state building code
 
03:03:39.190 --> 03:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
review board for informational purposes
 
03:03:41.510 --> 03:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
and the building code review board is
 
03:03:43.830 --> 03:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
intending to keep
 
03:03:43.840 --> 03:03:44.710 align:start position:0%
intending to keep
a

03:03:44.710 --> 03:03:44.720 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:03:47.670 --> 03:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
a database of which local amendments are
 
03:03:49.750 --> 03:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
in place because it's extremely
 
03:03:53.110 --> 03:03:53.120 align:start position:0%
difficult to find that out right now
 
03:03:53.120 --> 03:03:55.110 align:start position:0%
difficult to find that out right now
okay

03:03:55.110 --> 03:03:55.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:03:57.910 --> 03:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
the uh section seven biomass burning
 
03:04:00.550 --> 03:04:00.560 align:start position:0%
boilers and and log structures
 
03:04:00.560 --> 03:04:01.349 align:start position:0%
boilers and and log structures
just

03:04:01.349 --> 03:04:01.359 align:start position:0%
just
 
03:04:04.070 --> 03:04:04.080 align:start position:0%
incorporates into the building code
 
03:04:04.080 --> 03:04:04.950 align:start position:0%
incorporates into the building code
uh

03:04:04.950 --> 03:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:04:07.030 --> 03:04:07.040 align:start position:0%
some specific items that we had we have
 
03:04:10.389 --> 03:04:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:13.510 --> 03:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:16.469 --> 03:04:16.479 align:start position:0%
okay and
 
03:04:20.550 --> 03:04:20.560 align:start position:0%
sec section 8 which starts on 15 line 15
 
03:04:22.790 --> 03:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
on page 3
 
03:04:25.510 --> 03:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
requires the building code review board
 
03:04:25.520 --> 03:04:26.469 align:start position:0%
requires the building code review board
to

03:04:26.469 --> 03:04:26.479 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:04:26.479 --> 03:04:28.309 align:start position:0%
to
review

03:04:28.309 --> 03:04:28.319 align:start position:0%
review
 
03:04:28.319 --> 03:04:30.790 align:start position:0%
review
a

03:04:30.790 --> 03:04:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:33.590 --> 03:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
a new version of the building code and
 
03:04:37.110 --> 03:04:37.120 align:start position:0%
recommend adoption with amendments
 
03:04:37.120 --> 03:04:38.790 align:start position:0%
recommend adoption with amendments
for

03:04:38.790 --> 03:04:38.800 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:04:41.110 --> 03:04:41.120 align:start position:0%
for legislative approval approximately
 
03:04:43.030 --> 03:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
every three years
 
03:04:44.630 --> 03:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
the code
 
03:04:46.790 --> 03:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
changes every three years
 
03:04:50.790 --> 03:04:50.800 align:start position:0%
we fell almost 12 years behind
 
03:04:54.469 --> 03:04:54.479 align:start position:0%
before we adopted the 15 and it was
 
03:04:56.389 --> 03:04:56.399 align:start position:0%
a great difficulty for everybody
 
03:04:58.309 --> 03:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
involved to keep up with it
 
03:05:01.590 --> 03:05:01.600 align:start position:0%
so now that we're on the 15
 
03:05:03.750 --> 03:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
this bill will move it up to the 18
 
03:05:06.389 --> 03:05:06.399 align:start position:0%
schedule and in three years or so
 
03:05:08.110 --> 03:05:08.120 align:start position:0%
they'll be reviewing the
 
03:05:08.120 --> 03:05:09.750 align:start position:0%
they'll be reviewing the
2021

03:05:09.750 --> 03:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
2021
 
03:05:12.309 --> 03:05:12.319 align:start position:0%
codes with an eye to adoption and what
 
03:05:14.630 --> 03:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
amendments we need
 
03:05:17.349 --> 03:05:17.359 align:start position:0%
the reason to stay three years behind is
 
03:05:17.359 --> 03:05:18.469 align:start position:0%
the reason to stay three years behind is
that

03:05:18.469 --> 03:05:18.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:05:20.469 --> 03:05:20.479 align:start position:0%
when the codes are first published there
 
03:05:23.510 --> 03:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:25.590 --> 03:05:25.600 align:start position:0%
errors and vagueness
 
03:05:27.830 --> 03:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
and omissions that need to be fixed so
 
03:05:29.030 --> 03:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
we'll let the
 
03:05:31.190 --> 03:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
more forward thinking in larger states
 
03:05:32.870 --> 03:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
with bigger staffs
 
03:05:34.790 --> 03:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
go through and find these issues and
 
03:05:36.710 --> 03:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
then we'll uh we'll adopt them after a
 
03:05:38.550 --> 03:05:38.560 align:start position:0%
couple of years
 
03:05:41.110 --> 03:05:41.120 align:start position:0%
and what's that
 
03:05:43.510 --> 03:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
that's about it the uh if you have
 
03:05:45.110 --> 03:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
questions i'll try to answer them we've
 
03:05:47.269 --> 03:05:47.279 align:start position:0%
got some real experts behind me that can
 
03:05:50.230 --> 03:05:50.240 align:start position:0%
answer the technical questions
 
03:05:52.070 --> 03:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
representative lucas
 
03:05:54.070 --> 03:05:54.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um
 
03:05:55.349 --> 03:05:55.359 align:start position:0%
is there
 
03:05:57.670 --> 03:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
a document or list that kind of gives a
 
03:06:00.070 --> 03:06:00.080 align:start position:0%
summary of the changes from the 2015 to
 
03:06:02.469 --> 03:06:02.479 align:start position:0%
2018 building codes available
 
03:06:02.479 --> 03:06:04.710 align:start position:0%
2018 building codes available
someplace

03:06:04.710 --> 03:06:04.720 align:start position:0%
someplace
 
03:06:06.710 --> 03:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
i know there is because they provided it
 
03:06:10.230 --> 03:06:10.240 align:start position:0%
to the committee on updates i don't
 
03:06:11.990 --> 03:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
i have a copy of it at home i didn't
 
03:06:13.429 --> 03:06:13.439 align:start position:0%
bring it with me you can ask the
 
03:06:16.550 --> 03:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
building code review board people for it
 
03:06:17.910 --> 03:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
uh follow-up
 
03:06:19.349 --> 03:06:19.359 align:start position:0%
actually another question
 
03:06:19.359 --> 03:06:20.870 align:start position:0%
actually another question
um

03:06:20.870 --> 03:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:06:23.510 --> 03:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
there's uh two sections on page three
 
03:06:25.510 --> 03:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
line uh starting line four and line
 
03:06:27.190 --> 03:06:27.200 align:start position:0%
twelve there's a
 
03:06:29.269 --> 03:06:29.279 align:start position:0%
similar language that's struck out i'm
 
03:06:29.279 --> 03:06:30.389 align:start position:0%
similar language that's struck out i'm
just

03:06:30.389 --> 03:06:30.399 align:start position:0%
just
 
03:06:31.990 --> 03:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
not clear to me what the effect is of
 
03:06:33.429 --> 03:06:33.439 align:start position:0%
doing that
 
03:06:35.269 --> 03:06:35.279 align:start position:0%
the it struck out because right now it
 
03:06:38.070 --> 03:06:38.080 align:start position:0%
says they shall be
 
03:06:40.790 --> 03:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
ratified by appropriate legislation if
 
03:06:42.950 --> 03:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
that has been done already
 
03:06:44.309 --> 03:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
n word and
 
03:06:46.710 --> 03:06:46.720 align:start position:0%
this bill just incorporates it into the
 
03:06:49.030 --> 03:06:49.040 align:start position:0%
previous approval that's on page one
 
03:06:51.830 --> 03:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you i i
 
03:06:54.070 --> 03:06:54.080 align:start position:0%
before i go i have a
 
03:06:57.830 --> 03:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh a confession it turns out that when
 
03:07:00.150 --> 03:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
we drafted this bill and it was reviewed
 
03:07:03.030 --> 03:07:03.040 align:start position:0%
by half a dozen people in the field
 
03:07:05.830 --> 03:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
we neglected to include an update to the
 
03:07:07.670 --> 03:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
state fire code
 
03:07:10.790 --> 03:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
which had been intended and i'm working
 
03:07:13.510 --> 03:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
working on an amendment to add it back
 
03:07:13.520 --> 03:07:15.030 align:start position:0%
working on an amendment to add it back
in

03:07:15.030 --> 03:07:15.040 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:07:17.030 --> 03:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
that was
 
03:07:19.510 --> 03:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
everybody involved read the bill and
 
03:07:21.429 --> 03:07:21.439 align:start position:0%
said yep that's good and didn't notice
 
03:07:23.990 --> 03:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
the fire code hadn't been included so i
 
03:07:26.870 --> 03:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
apologize abjectly and i will get the
 
03:07:29.750 --> 03:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
amendment it so you can ask people about
 
03:07:29.760 --> 03:07:30.790 align:start position:0%
amendment it so you can ask people about
it

03:07:30.790 --> 03:07:30.800 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:07:32.790 --> 03:07:32.800 align:start position:0%
everyone else here knows about that
 
03:07:35.349 --> 03:07:35.359 align:start position:0%
omission and it was intended to be
 
03:07:37.830 --> 03:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
included from the beginning we just
 
03:07:43.590 --> 03:07:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:45.190 --> 03:07:45.200 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions for the
 
03:07:45.200 --> 03:07:47.670 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions for the
representative

03:07:47.670 --> 03:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:07:50.830 --> 03:07:50.840 align:start position:0%
representative grota thank you
 
03:07:53.590 --> 03:07:53.600 align:start position:0%
um representative mcguire i'm going back
 
03:07:54.950 --> 03:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
to the
 
03:07:57.429 --> 03:07:57.439 align:start position:0%
part of the bill that talks about a
 
03:08:01.670 --> 03:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:01.680 --> 03:08:04.150 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:08:04.150 --> 03:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:06.469 --> 03:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
if someone were to say
 
03:08:08.389 --> 03:08:08.399 align:start position:0%
that they're going to adopt the two
 
03:08:10.630 --> 03:08:10.640 align:start position:0%
let's say it's 2000
 
03:08:12.389 --> 03:08:12.399 align:start position:0%
let's say to now
 
03:08:15.349 --> 03:08:15.359 align:start position:0%
and they're going to adopt the 2015
 
03:08:15.359 --> 03:08:17.670 align:start position:0%
and they're going to adopt the 2015
codes

03:08:17.670 --> 03:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
codes
 
03:08:18.950 --> 03:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry representative groeder but
 
03:08:20.389 --> 03:08:20.399 align:start position:0%
that's not possible
 
03:08:23.429 --> 03:08:23.439 align:start position:0%
you can either adopt the the code as it
 
03:08:25.590 --> 03:08:25.600 align:start position:0%
is approved
 
03:08:28.309 --> 03:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
or you can adopt the newer version
 
03:08:32.870 --> 03:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:35.429 --> 03:08:35.439 align:start position:0%
oh i see i see i see
 
03:08:35.439 --> 03:08:38.150 align:start position:0%
oh i see i see i see
so

03:08:38.150 --> 03:08:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:40.070 --> 03:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
how much long i mean what is the period
 
03:08:43.349 --> 03:08:43.359 align:start position:0%
of all when you say a six month overlap
 
03:08:45.190 --> 03:08:45.200 align:start position:0%
that means that if they use the previous
 
03:08:45.200 --> 03:08:46.309 align:start position:0%
that means that if they use the previous
code

03:08:46.309 --> 03:08:46.319 align:start position:0%
code
 
03:08:47.910 --> 03:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
they've got six months to finish their
 
03:08:47.920 --> 03:08:49.269 align:start position:0%
they've got six months to finish their
project

03:08:49.269 --> 03:08:49.279 align:start position:0%
project
 
03:08:49.279 --> 03:08:50.469 align:start position:0%
project
no

03:08:50.469 --> 03:08:50.479 align:start position:0%
no
 
03:08:51.830 --> 03:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
no they
 
03:08:55.670 --> 03:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
building permits to be to be issued
 
03:08:59.030 --> 03:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:03.190 --> 03:09:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:05.830 --> 03:09:05.840 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:09:08.309 --> 03:09:08.319 align:start position:0%
it's a great opportunity when
 
03:09:09.590 --> 03:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire is in the hot
 
03:09:13.269 --> 03:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:15.429 --> 03:09:15.439 align:start position:0%
in page two
 
03:09:16.950 --> 03:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
when i'm
 
03:09:18.469 --> 03:09:18.479 align:start position:0%
intimately familiar with your husband's
 
03:09:20.070 --> 03:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
background page two here we're talking
 
03:09:22.790 --> 03:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
about with the national electric code
 
03:09:24.790 --> 03:09:24.800 align:start position:0%
there is seems to be no love for arc
 
03:09:27.269 --> 03:09:27.279 align:start position:0%
fault circuit interrupters what what is
 
03:09:28.710 --> 03:09:28.720 align:start position:0%
the um
 
03:09:30.710 --> 03:09:30.720 align:start position:0%
what's the background as to why those
 
03:09:31.910 --> 03:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
those are
 
03:09:34.229 --> 03:09:34.239 align:start position:0%
specifically mentioned in
 
03:09:38.630 --> 03:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
it's because in i believe it was the uh
 
03:09:41.190 --> 03:09:41.200 align:start position:0%
the version after the 14 which would
 
03:09:43.590 --> 03:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
probably be the 17
 
03:09:44.870 --> 03:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
i think
 
03:09:48.389 --> 03:09:48.399 align:start position:0%
at some point after the 14 code there
 
03:09:50.870 --> 03:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
was a requirement for arc fault
 
03:09:53.190 --> 03:09:53.200 align:start position:0%
interrupter circuits be installed
 
03:09:55.510 --> 03:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
in many places in the house
 
03:09:57.030 --> 03:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
the problem is
 
03:09:59.510 --> 03:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
that in
 
03:09:59.520 --> 03:10:00.389 align:start position:0%
that in
most

03:10:00.389 --> 03:10:00.399 align:start position:0%
most
 
03:10:02.630 --> 03:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
electrical appliances are not entirely
 
03:10:05.110 --> 03:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
compatible with arc fault circuits so
 
03:10:07.429 --> 03:10:07.439 align:start position:0%
when your refrigerator turned on or your
 
03:10:09.429 --> 03:10:09.439 align:start position:0%
dryer or whatever it would blow the
 
03:10:09.439 --> 03:10:10.870 align:start position:0%
dryer or whatever it would blow the
circuit

03:10:10.870 --> 03:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
circuit
 
03:10:10.880 --> 03:10:12.389 align:start position:0%
circuit
and

03:10:12.389 --> 03:10:12.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:10:14.710 --> 03:10:14.720 align:start position:0%
that caused a great deal of trouble for
 
03:10:14.720 --> 03:10:16.070 align:start position:0%
that caused a great deal of trouble for
people

03:10:16.070 --> 03:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:10:17.590 --> 03:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
if particularly if they got something
 
03:10:19.750 --> 03:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
sensitive on the that's also on the
 
03:10:19.760 --> 03:10:21.030 align:start position:0%
sensitive on the that's also on the
circuit

03:10:21.030 --> 03:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
circuit
 
03:10:23.830 --> 03:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
and so we passed a law saying you can't
 
03:10:26.550 --> 03:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
that's not a requirement if you have
 
03:10:29.030 --> 03:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
what details uh there are people here
 
03:10:31.670 --> 03:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
who know them much more than i do
 
03:10:34.389 --> 03:10:34.399 align:start position:0%
i just remember that it was specifically
 
03:10:36.389 --> 03:10:36.399 align:start position:0%
approved in statute that you don't have
 
03:10:36.399 --> 03:10:37.429 align:start position:0%
approved in statute that you don't have
to

03:10:37.429 --> 03:10:37.439 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:10:39.190 --> 03:10:39.200 align:start position:0%
that you you could back off from the
 
03:10:41.110 --> 03:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
requirement for our fault circuits all
 
03:10:50.790 --> 03:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:54.150 --> 03:10:54.160 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
03:11:01.590 --> 03:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:03.190 --> 03:11:03.200 align:start position:0%
are there any members of the public that
 
03:11:06.229 --> 03:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
wish to testify on this bill
 
03:11:09.190 --> 03:11:09.200 align:start position:0%
if you or state agencies if you could oh
 
03:11:42.469 --> 03:11:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:42.479 --> 03:11:43.830 align:start position:0%
 
right

03:11:43.830 --> 03:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:11:43.840 --> 03:11:46.309 align:start position:0%
right
the

03:11:46.309 --> 03:11:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:50.870 --> 03:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
the committee recognizes mr toomey
 
03:12:04.070 --> 03:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:05.510 --> 03:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
good afternoon madam chair and members
 
03:12:07.910 --> 03:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
03:12:11.190 --> 03:12:11.200 align:start position:0%
just be brief i just asked i shared
 
03:12:11.200 --> 03:12:12.309 align:start position:0%
just be brief i just asked i shared
with

03:12:12.309 --> 03:12:12.319 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:12:14.070 --> 03:12:14.080 align:start position:0%
some written testimony to be passed
 
03:12:14.080 --> 03:12:15.670 align:start position:0%
some written testimony to be passed
around

03:12:15.670 --> 03:12:15.680 align:start position:0%
around
 
03:12:17.590 --> 03:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
the the state fire marshal's office
 
03:12:19.590 --> 03:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
supports the adoption of the 2018
 
03:12:22.550 --> 03:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
building and fire codes i apologize for
 
03:12:25.429 --> 03:12:25.439 align:start position:0%
us missing the fire code portion many of
 
03:12:27.830 --> 03:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
us stakeholders have been part of this
 
03:12:29.429 --> 03:12:29.439 align:start position:0%
over since through the summer and over
 
03:12:31.510 --> 03:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
the last few years working to improve
 
03:12:33.990 --> 03:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
the overall process uh
 
03:12:36.150 --> 03:12:36.160 align:start position:0%
but i think we've we've got a good plan
 
03:12:38.389 --> 03:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
in place to stay one code cycle behind
 
03:12:40.389 --> 03:12:40.399 align:start position:0%
or three years uh
 
03:12:42.870 --> 03:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
now and there's a great stakeholder
 
03:12:44.630 --> 03:12:44.640 align:start position:0%
input work and many of them are behind
 
03:12:47.269 --> 03:12:47.279 align:start position:0%
me today but
 
03:12:48.710 --> 03:12:48.720 align:start position:0%
our office has been working with the
 
03:12:49.830 --> 03:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
board of fire control on the
 
03:12:52.389 --> 03:12:52.399 align:start position:0%
specifically on the fire code since for
 
03:12:53.990 --> 03:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
the past two years
 
03:12:55.750 --> 03:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
the board of fire control in my office
 
03:12:58.229 --> 03:12:58.239 align:start position:0%
have been reviewing any proposed
 
03:12:59.670 --> 03:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
amendments and looking at change
 
03:13:02.389 --> 03:13:02.399 align:start position:0%
documents between the 15
 
03:13:04.309 --> 03:13:04.319 align:start position:0%
15 edition of nfpa one which was the
 
03:13:07.110 --> 03:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
uniform fire code in the 2015 edition of
 
03:13:09.429 --> 03:13:09.439 align:start position:0%
the life safety code and comparing that
 
03:13:11.030 --> 03:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
to what changes would be in place in the
 
03:13:13.030 --> 03:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
2018 codes
 
03:13:14.950 --> 03:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
we had multiple public hearings we
 
03:13:17.269 --> 03:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
worked with the stakeholder groups
 
03:13:21.510 --> 03:13:21.520 align:start position:0%
and uh had a hearing in january 27 2021
 
03:13:23.429 --> 03:13:23.439 align:start position:0%
and out of that came to uh nine
 
03:13:25.030 --> 03:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
amendments which are summarized on the
 
03:13:26.790 --> 03:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
back of this document which we believe
 
03:13:28.630 --> 03:13:28.640 align:start position:0%
should be moved forward as new hampshire
 
03:13:29.830 --> 03:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
amendments for the new hampshire state
 
03:13:32.150 --> 03:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
fire code
 
03:13:33.670 --> 03:13:33.680 align:start position:0%
in summary there are many of them are
 
03:13:35.269 --> 03:13:35.279 align:start position:0%
carry forward amendments that we've had
 
03:13:35.279 --> 03:13:37.190 align:start position:0%
carry forward amendments that we've had
since

03:13:37.190 --> 03:13:37.200 align:start position:0%
since
 
03:13:38.790 --> 03:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
earlier editions of the code they're
 
03:13:41.830 --> 03:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
currently in place in the 15 code
 
03:13:43.429 --> 03:13:43.439 align:start position:0%
there's some new requirements that came
 
03:13:46.150 --> 03:13:46.160 align:start position:0%
into play on the 2018 life safety code
 
03:13:48.950 --> 03:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
and nfpa one relative to fall protection
 
03:13:51.510 --> 03:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
uh we believe those are addressed well
 
03:13:53.990 --> 03:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
in the ada and also the building code
 
03:13:55.910 --> 03:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
and we didn't feel is necessary to also
 
03:13:57.349 --> 03:13:57.359 align:start position:0%
have them in the life safety code and
 
03:13:59.269 --> 03:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
the fire code because in some instances
 
03:14:01.110 --> 03:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
it conflicted with already existing
 
03:14:01.120 --> 03:14:02.710 align:start position:0%
it conflicted with already existing
codes

03:14:02.710 --> 03:14:02.720 align:start position:0%
codes
 
03:14:04.309 --> 03:14:04.319 align:start position:0%
we adjusted some requirements around
 
03:14:06.150 --> 03:14:06.160 align:start position:0%
sprinkler protection for the educational
 
03:14:07.830 --> 03:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
occupancies to align better with the
 
03:14:09.269 --> 03:14:09.279 align:start position:0%
building code
 
03:14:11.910 --> 03:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
we adjusted some requirements on minimum
 
03:14:13.590 --> 03:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
inspection frequencies for existing
 
03:14:13.600 --> 03:14:14.950 align:start position:0%
inspection frequencies for existing
occupancies

03:14:14.950 --> 03:14:14.960 align:start position:0%
occupancies
 
03:14:17.349 --> 03:14:17.359 align:start position:0%
we have in place now requirements for
 
03:14:18.870 --> 03:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
regular inspections for assembly
 
03:14:20.950 --> 03:14:20.960 align:start position:0%
audiences and educational occupancies in
 
03:14:23.990 --> 03:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
statute this if adopted would require
 
03:14:25.510 --> 03:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
inspections for everything all
 
03:14:26.950 --> 03:14:26.960 align:start position:0%
occupancies other than single-family
 
03:14:26.960 --> 03:14:27.990 align:start position:0%
occupancies other than single-family
homes

03:14:27.990 --> 03:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
homes
 
03:14:30.630 --> 03:14:30.640 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis based on risk and we
 
03:14:32.309 --> 03:14:32.319 align:start position:0%
felt that that would make sense to have
 
03:14:33.990 --> 03:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
that at the local level to decide what
 
03:14:36.309 --> 03:14:36.319 align:start position:0%
the requirements are and we
 
03:14:38.150 --> 03:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
suggested that language be changed from
 
03:14:40.710 --> 03:14:40.720 align:start position:0%
a shell to a may so that the framework
 
03:14:42.229 --> 03:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
was there but it could be addressed at
 
03:14:43.990 --> 03:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
the local level if they
 
03:14:45.670 --> 03:14:45.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to do that
 
03:14:47.910 --> 03:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
we brought some carry forwarded
 
03:14:49.349 --> 03:14:49.359 align:start position:0%
amendments and some adjustments to the
 
03:14:51.510 --> 03:14:51.520 align:start position:0%
consumer fireworks stores
 
03:14:53.590 --> 03:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
and also
 
03:14:55.670 --> 03:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
provide some flexibility for minimum
 
03:14:56.950 --> 03:14:56.960 align:start position:0%
professional qualifications for
 
03:14:58.790 --> 03:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
inspectors plans examiners and fire
 
03:15:01.670 --> 03:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
marshals or fire inspectors
 
03:15:03.670 --> 03:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
the the way the language read in nfpa
 
03:15:06.150 --> 03:15:06.160 align:start position:0%
one was that these would uh any of the
 
03:15:07.990 --> 03:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
inspectors or any of the plans examiners
 
03:15:09.830 --> 03:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
would require
 
03:15:11.590 --> 03:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
certain professional qualifications that
 
03:15:13.510 --> 03:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
would be mandatory in order them for to
 
03:15:15.750 --> 03:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
do their jobs well we think that's a
 
03:15:15.760 --> 03:15:17.190 align:start position:0%
do their jobs well we think that's a
wonderful

03:15:17.190 --> 03:15:17.200 align:start position:0%
wonderful
 
03:15:20.469 --> 03:15:20.479 align:start position:0%
move forward to advance the trades uh in
 
03:15:23.190 --> 03:15:23.200 align:start position:0%
the the profession but uh it's for
 
03:15:24.550 --> 03:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
especially for the smaller departments
 
03:15:27.429 --> 03:15:27.439 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult to get attain those
 
03:15:29.510 --> 03:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh so we wanted to have that language in
 
03:15:31.429 --> 03:15:31.439 align:start position:0%
there but not make it mandatory at this
 
03:15:33.590 --> 03:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
point in time so sort of a summary of
 
03:15:35.910 --> 03:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
where we're at with the petitions uh in
 
03:15:37.670 --> 03:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
general on the on the back to the
 
03:15:39.670 --> 03:15:39.680 align:start position:0%
building code side we've been uh we have
 
03:15:41.190 --> 03:15:41.200 align:start position:0%
been part of those conversations and
 
03:15:42.950 --> 03:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
we've been president at the board of the
 
03:15:44.790 --> 03:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
building code review board i'll let the
 
03:15:46.630 --> 03:15:46.640 align:start position:0%
people behind me speak more specifically
 
03:15:48.150 --> 03:15:48.160 align:start position:0%
to that but we do support the
 
03:15:49.510 --> 03:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
advancement of both the building and the
 
03:15:56.150 --> 03:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:58.150 --> 03:15:58.160 align:start position:0%
no questions
 
03:16:02.950 --> 03:16:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:10.710 --> 03:16:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:19.750 --> 03:16:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:21.750 --> 03:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
there we go
 
03:16:24.150 --> 03:16:24.160 align:start position:0%
good afternoon uh madam chairman aboard
 
03:16:26.070 --> 03:16:26.080 align:start position:0%
my name is stephen rancourt i'm a
 
03:16:27.349 --> 03:16:27.359 align:start position:0%
licensed electrician in the state of new
 
03:16:29.269 --> 03:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
hampshire and also the executive
 
03:16:31.429 --> 03:16:31.439 align:start position:0%

association

03:16:35.030 --> 03:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
association
 
03:16:37.510 --> 03:16:37.520 align:start position:0%
we're here to support this bill in part
 
03:16:39.030 --> 03:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
the way it's written in the updating of
 
03:16:40.870 --> 03:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
the codes we went through a long process
 
03:16:43.750 --> 03:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
of looking through the 2020 nec
 
03:16:44.790 --> 03:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
through the state building code
 
03:16:46.150 --> 03:16:46.160 align:start position:0%
subcommittees and
 
03:16:47.190 --> 03:16:47.200 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
03:16:49.590 --> 03:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
amend it as necessary and
 
03:16:51.670 --> 03:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
we we think that this should clear up
 
03:16:53.429 --> 03:16:53.439 align:start position:0%
any issues and go forward the one
 
03:16:54.630 --> 03:16:54.640 align:start position:0%
concern that you had when you talked
 
03:16:56.790 --> 03:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
about the ark faults was that
 
03:16:58.309 --> 03:16:58.319 align:start position:0%
originally it was put in we addressed
 
03:17:00.950 --> 03:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
the issue at the time it was the 2017
 
03:17:02.790 --> 03:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
code that was being addressed
 
03:17:04.229 --> 03:17:04.239 align:start position:0%
obviously as we've seen in a lot of
 
03:17:05.830 --> 03:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
legislature now we try to clean up the
 
03:17:07.510 --> 03:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
code so it doesn't have to come back
 
03:17:09.750 --> 03:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
every cycle to be fixed this would
 
03:17:11.510 --> 03:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
correct that issue
 
03:17:13.030 --> 03:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of arc faults and i'm sure a lot
 
03:17:14.469 --> 03:17:14.479 align:start position:0%
of people here remember don't want to
 
03:17:16.469 --> 03:17:16.479 align:start position:0%
get back into it but there's a long
 
03:17:18.550 --> 03:17:18.560 align:start position:0%
history in it causing a lot of issues
 
03:17:20.469 --> 03:17:20.479 align:start position:0%
and this was just expanding it beyond a
 
03:17:22.550 --> 03:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
level that was already there so
 
03:17:24.389 --> 03:17:24.399 align:start position:0%
this this would just simply make it
 
03:17:27.269 --> 03:17:27.279 align:start position:0%
consistent with that prior to 2017 going
 
03:17:28.710 --> 03:17:28.720 align:start position:0%
forward until they can get some more
 
03:17:30.870 --> 03:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
data and as an organization as an
 
03:17:32.309 --> 03:17:32.319 align:start position:0%
electrician we support this bill going
 
03:17:32.319 --> 03:17:36.309 align:start position:0%
electrician we support this bill going
forward

03:17:36.309 --> 03:17:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:38.389 --> 03:17:38.399 align:start position:0%
no questions
 
03:17:40.630 --> 03:17:40.640 align:start position:0%
representative pearson
 
03:17:42.229 --> 03:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you mr court for
 
03:17:44.150 --> 03:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:17:44.160 --> 03:17:45.110 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

03:17:45.110 --> 03:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:17:46.870 --> 03:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
i'm a former technical advisor for the
 
03:17:46.880 --> 03:17:48.389 align:start position:0%
i'm a former technical advisor for the
nfpa

03:17:48.389 --> 03:17:48.399 align:start position:0%
nfpa
 
03:17:50.150 --> 03:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
so i'll i'll just ask you this with your
 
03:17:52.550 --> 03:17:52.560 align:start position:0%
organization's issues with the
 
03:17:54.790 --> 03:17:54.800 align:start position:0%
specifically this part of the standard
 
03:17:57.030 --> 03:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
are you involved in the process to amend
 
03:17:59.110 --> 03:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
or or bring forward to the nfpa
 
03:18:01.190 --> 03:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
committee the concerns in reference to
 
03:18:01.200 --> 03:18:02.070 align:start position:0%
committee the concerns in reference to
that

03:18:02.070 --> 03:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:18:03.590 --> 03:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
because if we're bringing
 
03:18:06.550 --> 03:18:06.560 align:start position:0%
this concern of another cycle forward
 
03:18:08.309 --> 03:18:08.319 align:start position:0%
right this this can't be unique to new
 
03:18:10.229 --> 03:18:10.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire the industry is gonna i would
 
03:18:11.750 --> 03:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
presume is dealing with this in other
 
03:18:14.150 --> 03:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
avenues so for the nec not to not to
 
03:18:17.349 --> 03:18:17.359 align:start position:0%
take action or to modify it
 
03:18:18.790 --> 03:18:18.800 align:start position:0%
how am i to think that something unique
 
03:18:20.469 --> 03:18:20.479 align:start position:0%
is happening in new hampshire that's not
 
03:18:22.070 --> 03:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
necessarily happening in frequency
 
03:18:23.910 --> 03:18:23.920 align:start position:0%
enough to modify the code between
 
03:18:23.920 --> 03:18:25.750 align:start position:0%
enough to modify the code between
editions

03:18:25.750 --> 03:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
editions
 
03:18:27.429 --> 03:18:27.439 align:start position:0%
um well with all due respect i would say
 
03:18:29.030 --> 03:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
that it is happening across the country
 
03:18:30.870 --> 03:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
and if you look you'll see what model
 
03:18:33.030 --> 03:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
codes have been adopted across the state
 
03:18:35.030 --> 03:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
i think there's only and i'm not exactly
 
03:18:36.950 --> 03:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
sure like six or 12 that have adopted
 
03:18:39.429 --> 03:18:39.439 align:start position:0%
the 2020 so far out of 50 states
 
03:18:41.110 --> 03:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
and a lot of them still stay backwards
 
03:18:42.870 --> 03:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
on the arc faults the problem that
 
03:18:44.950 --> 03:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
happens and we we're okay with the arc
 
03:18:47.030 --> 03:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
fault technology so to speak but they
 
03:18:48.790 --> 03:18:48.800 align:start position:0%
don't require the manufacturers to make
 
03:18:51.590 --> 03:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
the products work with the arc faults so
 
03:18:53.590 --> 03:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
the i'm familiar with the the co-making
 
03:18:56.229 --> 03:18:56.239 align:start position:0%
process with the nfpa and it's very
 
03:18:58.550 --> 03:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
difficult to get that information in the
 
03:19:00.070 --> 03:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
everyday problems
 
03:19:01.590 --> 03:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
solved sometimes
 
03:19:03.110 --> 03:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
so that's why this amendment was put in
 
03:19:05.030 --> 03:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
because literally the code says that we
 
03:19:06.389 --> 03:19:06.399 align:start position:0%
have to put in for manufacturer's
 
03:19:07.910 --> 03:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
instructions and i can give you a copy
 
03:19:09.269 --> 03:19:09.279 align:start position:0%
of a manufacturer instruction that says
 
03:19:11.510 --> 03:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
don't put it on ockfall to ground fault
 
03:19:13.670 --> 03:19:13.680 align:start position:0%
so that's just one example
 
03:19:15.830 --> 03:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
people buy expensive
 
03:19:17.830 --> 03:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
microwaves and dishwashers and stoves
 
03:19:19.030 --> 03:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
refrigerators and the subzero
 
03:19:20.550 --> 03:19:20.560 align:start position:0%
refrigerators don't work on the oc
 
03:19:23.349 --> 03:19:23.359 align:start position:0%
faults but yeah we have to put them in
 
03:19:24.950 --> 03:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
there's no standard to be honest with
 
03:19:26.309 --> 03:19:26.319 align:start position:0%
you the problem is there's no standard
 
03:19:28.469 --> 03:19:28.479 align:start position:0%
for rock faults if there was and then
 
03:19:29.990 --> 03:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
every manufacturer had to work to that
 
03:19:31.910 --> 03:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
standard we wouldn't have this issue but
 
03:19:35.190 --> 03:19:35.200 align:start position:0%
every manufacturer can make their own
 
03:19:37.110 --> 03:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
version of an arc fault
 
03:19:39.429 --> 03:19:39.439 align:start position:0%
so it's across the board and when people
 
03:19:41.190 --> 03:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
call you up and they say my my breaker
 
03:19:42.469 --> 03:19:42.479 align:start position:0%
keeps tripping and i can't do anything
 
03:19:43.990 --> 03:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
because the code requires to put it in
 
03:19:45.670 --> 03:19:45.680 align:start position:0%
so this gives us some alleviate some of
 
03:19:46.790 --> 03:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
the issues
 
03:19:48.469 --> 03:19:48.479 align:start position:0%
remains into the bedrooms and places
 
03:19:50.389 --> 03:19:50.399 align:start position:0%
like that locations that are
 
03:19:52.550 --> 03:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
that are the most common for for fires
 
03:19:54.710 --> 03:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
and don't usually have those appliances
 
03:19:56.469 --> 03:19:56.479 align:start position:0%
per se in them that
 
03:19:56.479 --> 03:19:57.830 align:start position:0%
per se in them that
helps

03:19:57.830 --> 03:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
helps
 
03:19:59.990 --> 03:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
thank you that was extraordinarily well
 
03:20:04.950 --> 03:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:08.469 --> 03:20:08.479 align:start position:0%
see no further i think we'll be here
 
03:20:10.550 --> 03:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
sorry representative o'brien
 
03:20:12.309 --> 03:20:12.319 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:20:15.269 --> 03:20:15.279 align:start position:0%
my question is along the oc fault line
 
03:20:15.279 --> 03:20:16.309 align:start position:0%
my question is along the oc fault line
uh

03:20:16.309 --> 03:20:16.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:20:18.469 --> 03:20:18.479 align:start position:0%
kind of helped me out a bit i think if i
 
03:20:20.309 --> 03:20:20.319 align:start position:0%
was watering a house which i would never
 
03:20:22.389 --> 03:20:22.399 align:start position:0%
do but anyways
 
03:20:22.399 --> 03:20:23.429 align:start position:0%
do but anyways
uh

03:20:23.429 --> 03:20:23.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:20:26.550 --> 03:20:26.560 align:start position:0%
i grew up in a boston area where the
 
03:20:28.550 --> 03:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
same plug that ran the refrigerator ran
 
03:20:31.030 --> 03:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
the transistor radio in the front of the
 
03:20:33.830 --> 03:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
apartment but the thing is today now
 
03:20:36.870 --> 03:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
electrician will wire a separate
 
03:20:39.190 --> 03:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
wire just for the refrigerator am i
 
03:20:41.110 --> 03:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
correct or the microwave in the
 
03:20:42.870 --> 03:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
appliance and they may not have to be
 
03:20:45.429 --> 03:20:45.439 align:start position:0%
protected by opponent is that correct
 
03:20:46.790 --> 03:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
correct the uh they'll run a separate
 
03:20:48.950 --> 03:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
circuit to those higher parts and uh to
 
03:20:50.870 --> 03:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
try to create that and the amount of
 
03:20:51.990 --> 03:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
circuits that are put into a house
 
03:20:53.269 --> 03:20:53.279 align:start position:0%
nowadays are a lot more than what they
 
03:20:55.910 --> 03:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
used to be so it um that alleviates a
 
03:20:58.070 --> 03:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
lot of the problem but being on that and
 
03:20:59.429 --> 03:20:59.439 align:start position:0%
tripping if someone has a refrigerator
 
03:21:01.110 --> 03:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
and it trips the arc fault and just
 
03:21:03.269 --> 03:21:03.279 align:start position:0%
because of the refrigerator itself
 
03:21:04.630 --> 03:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
nothing else really wrong with it
 
03:21:06.070 --> 03:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
because of the frequency that with the
 
03:21:07.750 --> 03:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
arc fault strip they lose everything in
 
03:21:08.790 --> 03:21:08.800 align:start position:0%
the refrigerator in the middle of the
 
03:21:15.830 --> 03:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:18.950 --> 03:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:23.750 --> 03:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:32.710 --> 03:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:34.870 --> 03:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
oh my elastic gave up right at the right
 
03:21:34.880 --> 03:21:36.469 align:start position:0%
oh my elastic gave up right at the right
time

03:21:36.469 --> 03:21:36.479 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:21:38.070 --> 03:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
my name is philip sherman i'm the chair
 
03:21:40.070 --> 03:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
of the building code review board
 
03:21:41.990 --> 03:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
madam chair and members of the committee
 
03:21:44.389 --> 03:21:44.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for listening to me here i'm
 
03:21:46.630 --> 03:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
speaking in favor of this bill
 
03:21:48.229 --> 03:21:48.239 align:start position:0%
it's important that this bill be passed
 
03:21:50.630 --> 03:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
in order to adopt the various 2018
 
03:21:52.950 --> 03:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
international code council codes as well
 
03:21:56.150 --> 03:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
as a 2020 national electric code and as
 
03:21:58.389 --> 03:21:58.399 align:start position:0%
well to ratify the various new hampshire
 
03:22:00.389 --> 03:22:00.399 align:start position:0%
amendments which have been approved by
 
03:22:02.229 --> 03:22:02.239 align:start position:0%
the bcrb
 
03:22:04.070 --> 03:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
this bill helps keep new hampshire
 
03:22:06.070 --> 03:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
consistent with the desire to adopt
 
03:22:07.670 --> 03:22:07.680 align:start position:0%
model codes that have been published for
 
03:22:10.150 --> 03:22:10.160 align:start position:0%
two years and will ultimately help us to
 
03:22:13.349 --> 03:22:13.359 align:start position:0%
get onto a standard three-year cycle
 
03:22:15.030 --> 03:22:15.040 align:start position:0%
this bill corrects some language as
 
03:22:15.990 --> 03:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
you've heard
 
03:22:17.990 --> 03:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
regarding all arc fault circuit
 
03:22:20.469 --> 03:22:20.479 align:start position:0%
interrupters it cleans up some language
 
03:22:22.950 --> 03:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
regarding the current vcrb review and
 
03:22:25.349 --> 03:22:25.359 align:start position:0%
approval process which requires an
 
03:22:27.510 --> 03:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
amendment to await ratification by the
 
03:22:30.630 --> 03:22:30.640 align:start position:0%
legislature prior to becoming effective
 
03:22:36.070 --> 03:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
both hb 1681 and sb 398 provide for a
 
03:22:38.309 --> 03:22:38.319 align:start position:0%
six month grace period
 
03:22:40.389 --> 03:22:40.399 align:start position:0%
where the current code or the updated
 
03:22:43.190 --> 03:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
code may be used the two bills used
 
03:22:44.790 --> 03:22:44.800 align:start position:0%
slightly different language to
 
03:22:47.510 --> 03:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
accomplish the same end and we recommend
 
03:22:51.429 --> 03:22:51.439 align:start position:0%
that the language in hb 1681 be used and
 
03:22:53.349 --> 03:22:53.359 align:start position:0%
i've submitted a comment to the senate
 
03:22:57.190 --> 03:22:57.200 align:start position:0%
committee on sb 398 to that effect
 
03:22:59.349 --> 03:22:59.359 align:start position:0%
further the bill provides a six-month
 
03:23:00.710 --> 03:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
grace period where the current of the
 
03:23:02.389 --> 03:23:02.399 align:start position:0%
updated code may be used at the
 
03:23:04.710 --> 03:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
discretion of the applicant
 
03:23:06.550 --> 03:23:06.560 align:start position:0%
a point has been raised by one of our
 
03:23:09.670 --> 03:23:09.680 align:start position:0%
members that with the 60-day delay
 
03:23:11.910 --> 03:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
in the effective date of this bill
 
03:23:14.070 --> 03:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
followed by the six-month grace period
 
03:23:15.830 --> 03:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
it starts to look more like an eight
 
03:23:15.840 --> 03:23:17.030 align:start position:0%
it starts to look more like an eight
month

03:23:17.030 --> 03:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
month
 
03:23:18.710 --> 03:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
grace period
 
03:23:20.229 --> 03:23:20.239 align:start position:0%
given the fact that we're offering the
 
03:23:22.389 --> 03:23:22.399 align:start position:0%
grace period and to maintain the maximum
 
03:23:24.870 --> 03:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
flexibility for the users of the code
 
03:23:26.870 --> 03:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
there may not be a need to delay the
 
03:23:28.550 --> 03:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
effective late of the
 
03:23:31.349 --> 03:23:31.359 align:start position:0%
effective date of this this bill for the
 
03:23:33.670 --> 03:23:33.680 align:start position:0%
full 60 days there may be some minimum
 
03:23:35.990 --> 03:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
period that's necessary for for other
 
03:23:36.000 --> 03:23:38.150 align:start position:0%
period that's necessary for for other
purposes

03:23:38.150 --> 03:23:38.160 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
03:23:40.469 --> 03:23:40.479 align:start position:0%
there's also some overlap between hb
 
03:23:43.830 --> 03:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
1681 and sb 433
 
03:23:45.830 --> 03:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
regarding the posting of municipal
 
03:23:45.840 --> 03:23:47.030 align:start position:0%
regarding the posting of municipal
amendments

03:23:47.030 --> 03:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
03:23:48.950 --> 03:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
this bill maintains the current
 
03:23:51.910 --> 03:23:51.920 align:start position:0%
requirement that the bcrb post municipal
 
03:23:53.990 --> 03:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
amendments which are forwarded to us
 
03:23:56.870 --> 03:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
only for informational purposes and adds
 
03:23:59.349 --> 03:23:59.359 align:start position:0%
the provision that we do so only after
 
03:24:04.910 --> 03:24:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:08.550 --> 03:24:08.560 align:start position:0%
sb443 requires that the bcrb confirm
 
03:24:10.950 --> 03:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
municipal appendments prior to adoption
 
03:24:13.030 --> 03:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
by the local jurisdiction
 
03:24:17.269 --> 03:24:17.279 align:start position:0%
and our proposed changes to sb 443
 
03:24:19.670 --> 03:24:19.680 align:start position:0%
will coordinate that requirement with
 
03:24:22.070 --> 03:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
the requirement to post
 
03:24:23.910 --> 03:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
we simply
 
03:24:27.429 --> 03:24:27.439 align:start position:0%
would ask that if sb 443 not move
 
03:24:30.150 --> 03:24:30.160 align:start position:0%
forward or not be passed that we not
 
03:24:31.990 --> 03:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
lose the language that's currently in
 
03:24:34.389 --> 03:24:34.399 align:start position:0%
this bill which simply protects us from
 
03:24:35.910 --> 03:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
the need to post something that we don't
 
03:24:37.510 --> 03:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
know about
 
03:24:39.590 --> 03:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
in conclusion we support this bill as
 
03:24:41.590 --> 03:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
written but suggest a quicker effective
 
03:24:43.590 --> 03:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
date i'll submit these comments in
 
03:24:45.269 --> 03:24:45.279 align:start position:0%
writing and happy to respond to any
 
03:24:45.279 --> 03:24:47.349 align:start position:0%
writing and happy to respond to any
questions

03:24:47.349 --> 03:24:47.359 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:24:47.359 --> 03:24:48.790 align:start position:0%
questions
representative

03:24:48.790 --> 03:24:48.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:24:50.790 --> 03:24:50.800 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
03:24:53.190 --> 03:24:53.200 align:start position:0%
so same question i asked chair mcguire
 
03:24:55.190 --> 03:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
and that is is there a summary of the
 
03:24:57.110 --> 03:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
changes between
 
03:24:58.550 --> 03:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
the current code and the code we're
 
03:25:03.269 --> 03:25:03.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:04.389 --> 03:25:04.399 align:start position:0%
so our
 
03:25:07.110 --> 03:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
our board uses a series of committees
 
03:25:08.469 --> 03:25:08.479 align:start position:0%
for each code
 
03:25:10.710 --> 03:25:10.720 align:start position:0%
and all of their work is posted on our
 
03:25:10.720 --> 03:25:12.070 align:start position:0%
and all of their work is posted on our
website

03:25:12.070 --> 03:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
website
 
03:25:15.429 --> 03:25:15.439 align:start position:0%
each committee submitted a short report
 
03:25:17.910 --> 03:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
usually a page or two long
 
03:25:20.070 --> 03:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
essentially summarizing their work
 
03:25:22.469 --> 03:25:22.479 align:start position:0%
comparing the changes those also are on
 
03:25:23.910 --> 03:25:23.920 align:start position:0%
the website
 
03:25:26.389 --> 03:25:26.399 align:start position:0%
all of the exhibits which are an exhibit
 
03:25:28.389 --> 03:25:28.399 align:start position:0%
for each amendment that's being proposed
 
03:25:31.910 --> 03:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
are likewise posted within that work
 
03:25:34.070 --> 03:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
so there is not one
 
03:25:36.469 --> 03:25:36.479 align:start position:0%
complete summary but there is a summary
 
03:25:40.150 --> 03:25:40.160 align:start position:0%
by by code for the seven codes or
 
03:25:41.910 --> 03:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
eight codes we're talking about here
 
03:25:41.920 --> 03:25:44.469 align:start position:0%
eight codes we're talking about here
follow-up

03:25:44.469 --> 03:25:44.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:46.309 --> 03:25:46.319 align:start position:0%
can you please send an email to the
 
03:25:49.590 --> 03:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
committee uh pointing to those happy too
 
03:25:56.150 --> 03:25:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:57.750 --> 03:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions we thank you
 
03:26:01.110 --> 03:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
for your testimony thank you
 
03:26:11.510 --> 03:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:12.950 --> 03:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
good afternoon madam chair members of
 
03:26:14.229 --> 03:26:14.239 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is william

and moving forward to the 2018 codes
 
03:26:42.630 --> 03:26:42.640 align:start position:0%
it's very important as a code official
 
03:26:43.990 --> 03:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
and for the state of new hampshire and
 
03:26:46.070 --> 03:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
our municipalities that new hampshire
 
03:26:48.469 --> 03:26:48.479 align:start position:0%
moves forward with getting onto a
 
03:26:50.710 --> 03:26:50.720 align:start position:0%
three-year code cycle adoption
 
03:26:53.030 --> 03:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
there's lots of there's lots of
 
03:26:55.750 --> 03:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
technologies and advancements in the
 
03:26:57.750 --> 03:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
construction industry that the codes
 
03:26:59.190 --> 03:26:59.200 align:start position:0%
keep up with and if we don't keep up
 
03:27:01.349 --> 03:27:01.359 align:start position:0%
with the codes we fall behind
 
03:27:03.670 --> 03:27:03.680 align:start position:0%
also with by keeping up with the codes
 
03:27:05.830 --> 03:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
you also help those communities stay up
 
03:27:09.269 --> 03:27:09.279 align:start position:0%
to date with their um iso ratings if
 
03:27:10.469 --> 03:27:10.479 align:start position:0%
you're familiar with that that's a
 
03:27:12.469 --> 03:27:12.479 align:start position:0%
rating for the insurance industry that
 
03:27:14.790 --> 03:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
helps to set the rates for property
 
03:27:17.349 --> 03:27:17.359 align:start position:0%
insurances by the by the state falling
 
03:27:19.349 --> 03:27:19.359 align:start position:0%
falling behind in the building codes the
 
03:27:21.349 --> 03:27:21.359 align:start position:0%
communities are affected and it also
 
03:27:23.190 --> 03:27:23.200 align:start position:0%
affects those communities it can affect
 
03:27:25.030 --> 03:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
those communities for the insurance
 
03:27:25.040 --> 03:27:27.510 align:start position:0%
those communities for the insurance
rates

03:27:27.510 --> 03:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:29.510 --> 03:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
two cur two concerns were brought up
 
03:27:32.790 --> 03:27:32.800 align:start position:0%
today um by other members here um
 
03:27:36.550 --> 03:27:36.560 align:start position:0%
the first is the um six month delay
 
03:27:38.710 --> 03:27:38.720 align:start position:0%
we support the six-month delay but we do
 
03:27:40.469 --> 03:27:40.479 align:start position:0%
have a concern with as the bill is
 
03:27:45.510 --> 03:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:47.670 --> 03:27:47.680 align:start position:0%
after passage that would essentially
 
03:27:49.910 --> 03:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
make it an eighth month delay as it's
 
03:27:51.510 --> 03:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
written right now so we do support the
 
03:27:54.070 --> 03:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
six-month delay that allows
 
03:27:55.990 --> 03:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
contractors license design professionals
 
03:27:58.950 --> 03:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
to work either on either the new code or
 
03:28:00.950 --> 03:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
the code existing
 
03:28:02.469 --> 03:28:02.479 align:start position:0%
for that period while they finish up
 
03:28:04.150 --> 03:28:04.160 align:start position:0%
their projects
 
03:28:06.630 --> 03:28:06.640 align:start position:0%
and again we also do support
 
03:28:09.269 --> 03:28:09.279 align:start position:0%
inclusion of the new hampshire fire code
 
03:28:11.269 --> 03:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
in this bill that's an important piece
 
03:28:13.030 --> 03:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the building codes and
 
03:28:15.269 --> 03:28:15.279 align:start position:0%
the fire codes move forward together for
 
03:28:16.389 --> 03:28:16.399 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
03:28:18.309 --> 03:28:18.319 align:start position:0%
and with that i will entertain any
 
03:28:18.319 --> 03:28:24.389 align:start position:0%
and with that i will entertain any
questions

03:28:24.389 --> 03:28:24.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:26.630 --> 03:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
representative scitec mr mckinney would
 
03:28:28.710 --> 03:28:28.720 align:start position:0%
you say your goal be accomplished if we
 
03:28:30.389 --> 03:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
draft an amendment to this to make the
 
03:28:34.150 --> 03:28:34.160 align:start position:0%
delays four months plus 60 days after
 
03:28:36.790 --> 03:28:36.800 align:start position:0%
uh passage if that you'll still get your
 
03:28:38.389 --> 03:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
six months
 
03:28:39.429 --> 03:28:39.439 align:start position:0%
correct that
 
03:28:40.550 --> 03:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
that i would leave that up to the
 
03:28:46.550 --> 03:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:48.710 --> 03:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
03:28:50.309 --> 03:28:50.319 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
03:28:52.870 --> 03:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:29:06.469 --> 03:29:06.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:07.990 --> 03:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
there we go
 
03:29:10.070 --> 03:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
you were just about to tell me
 
03:29:11.990 --> 03:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
good afternoon madam chair members of
 
03:29:13.429 --> 03:29:13.439 align:start position:0%
the committee i'm ari pollock i'm an
 
03:29:14.870 --> 03:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
attorney at the gallagher firm in
 
03:29:16.870 --> 03:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
concord i'm here today as a lobbyist for
 
03:29:18.950 --> 03:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire homebuilders we do
 
03:29:20.389 --> 03:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
support the bill
 
03:29:22.309 --> 03:29:22.319 align:start position:0%
we also support the amendment that the
 
03:29:24.070 --> 03:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
fire marshal's office has discussed
 
03:29:26.830 --> 03:29:26.840 align:start position:0%
relating to the inclusion of the
 
03:29:30.950 --> 03:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
2018 nfpa codes for new hampshire
 
03:29:33.349 --> 03:29:33.359 align:start position:0%
the home builders for a long period of
 
03:29:36.469 --> 03:29:36.479 align:start position:0%
time have been a stakeholder at both the
 
03:29:38.469 --> 03:29:38.479 align:start position:0%
building code review board and the fire
 
03:29:40.950 --> 03:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
control board and have worked on what
 
03:29:43.429 --> 03:29:43.439 align:start position:0%
has been described today as the carry
 
03:29:45.990 --> 03:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
forward amendments so that compromises
 
03:29:48.309 --> 03:29:48.319 align:start position:0%
that were baked into the 2015 version of
 
03:29:50.550 --> 03:29:50.560 align:start position:0%
the code are now coming forward as
 
03:29:53.429 --> 03:29:53.439 align:start position:0%
amendments baked into the 2018 version
 
03:29:55.910 --> 03:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
of the code so that if this bill passes
 
03:29:58.389 --> 03:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
as introduced it would not only
 
03:30:00.710 --> 03:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
recognize an amendment to the definition
 
03:30:03.349 --> 03:30:03.359 align:start position:0%
of the state code moving the 2015
 
03:30:06.070 --> 03:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
versions to 2018 but it would bring
 
03:30:08.469 --> 03:30:08.479 align:start position:0%
forward those amendments that modify
 
03:30:10.389 --> 03:30:10.399 align:start position:0%
some of the language for its use in new
 
03:30:12.550 --> 03:30:12.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire we think those compromises are
 
03:30:14.469 --> 03:30:14.479 align:start position:0%
important and it's the basis of our
 
03:30:17.110 --> 03:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
support for the bill and for the change
 
03:30:21.590 --> 03:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
from the 2015 to the 2018 codes we also
 
03:30:24.070 --> 03:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
recognize the importance of what's been
 
03:30:25.110 --> 03:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
called the
 
03:30:27.030 --> 03:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
grace period or
 
03:30:29.590 --> 03:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
in the bill the concurrency period
 
03:30:31.990 --> 03:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
we think that's an important measure to
 
03:30:33.910 --> 03:30:33.920 align:start position:0%
provide some protection to
 
03:30:36.150 --> 03:30:36.160 align:start position:0%
project designers architects project
 
03:30:38.550 --> 03:30:38.560 align:start position:0%
owners general contractors who have been
 
03:30:40.229 --> 03:30:40.239 align:start position:0%
relying upon a certain version of the
 
03:30:42.710 --> 03:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
code and creating their project maybe
 
03:30:44.309 --> 03:30:44.319 align:start position:0%
there's reason to move forward in the
 
03:30:46.469 --> 03:30:46.479 align:start position:0%
code give them that election but also
 
03:30:48.389 --> 03:30:48.399 align:start position:0%
give them the protection of that
 
03:30:50.229 --> 03:30:50.239 align:start position:0%
concurrency period to stick with what
 
03:30:52.550 --> 03:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
they've been designing under not knowing
 
03:30:54.309 --> 03:30:54.319 align:start position:0%
fully whether or not another version of
 
03:30:56.309 --> 03:30:56.319 align:start position:0%
the code would come in at a particular
 
03:30:56.319 --> 03:30:58.229 align:start position:0%
the code would come in at a particular
time

03:30:58.229 --> 03:30:58.239 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:31:00.710 --> 03:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
otherwise let me just conclude by saying
 
03:31:02.630 --> 03:31:02.640 align:start position:0%
that i've been doing this long enough to
 
03:31:05.030 --> 03:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
have seen the opposite process where the
 
03:31:07.269 --> 03:31:07.279 align:start position:0%
stakeholders don't work well together
 
03:31:09.590 --> 03:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
the process becomes rather broken down
 
03:31:10.870 --> 03:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
and unpleasant
 
03:31:12.389 --> 03:31:12.399 align:start position:0%
and it's the opposite of what you're
 
03:31:14.309 --> 03:31:14.319 align:start position:0%
being presented with today and there's
 
03:31:16.309 --> 03:31:16.319 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of credit to go around for
 
03:31:18.870 --> 03:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
um the the kumbaya you're seeing with
 
03:31:20.550 --> 03:31:20.560 align:start position:0%
everyone testifying in support of the
 
03:31:22.870 --> 03:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
bill and uh and and no big mob in the
 
03:31:25.990 --> 03:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
back that's making angry faces at me um
 
03:31:27.830 --> 03:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
it's a it's really a well maybe they are
 
03:31:29.990 --> 03:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
i can't see and i don't dare turn around
 
03:31:30.000 --> 03:31:31.110 align:start position:0%
i can't see and i don't dare turn around
um

03:31:31.110 --> 03:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:31:34.389 --> 03:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
i'll uh i'll hope for the best but um
 
03:31:35.990 --> 03:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
let me just say that there are there
 
03:31:37.750 --> 03:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
have been a core group of legislators
 
03:31:40.309 --> 03:31:40.319 align:start position:0%
that have really championed this cause
 
03:31:42.630 --> 03:31:42.640 align:start position:0%
chairman mcguire leading that pack of
 
03:31:42.640 --> 03:31:43.510 align:start position:0%
chairman mcguire leading that pack of
course

03:31:43.510 --> 03:31:43.520 align:start position:0%
course
 
03:31:45.269 --> 03:31:45.279 align:start position:0%
senator carson on the senate side and
 
03:31:45.279 --> 03:31:46.309 align:start position:0%
senator carson on the senate side and
others

03:31:46.309 --> 03:31:46.319 align:start position:0%
others
 
03:31:47.990 --> 03:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
but also the stakeholders that are in
 
03:31:50.469 --> 03:31:50.479 align:start position:0%
the room today and of course folks from
 
03:31:52.309 --> 03:31:52.319 align:start position:0%
the department of safety
 
03:31:54.630 --> 03:31:54.640 align:start position:0%
and the fire marshal's office so happy
 
03:31:56.630 --> 03:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
to be part of the chorus and uh support
 
03:31:59.910 --> 03:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:01.750 --> 03:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
and there any questions
 
03:32:03.269 --> 03:32:03.279 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
03:32:05.429 --> 03:32:05.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for engaging in the humorous

03:32:16.550 --> 03:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
we've already done mckinney
 
03:32:28.790 --> 03:32:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:30.710 --> 03:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
so i'm not exactly sure what this last
 
03:32:32.710 --> 03:32:32.720 align:start position:0%
name is but is there a gentleman by the
 
03:32:54.150 --> 03:32:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:55.910 --> 03:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair and members of
 
03:32:58.469 --> 03:32:58.479 align:start position:0%
the committee uh yes my wife was hoping
 
03:32:59.910 --> 03:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
to meet a man named smith but
 
03:33:01.590 --> 03:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
unfortunately she married a man named mr

with clean energy new hampshire
 
03:33:08.550 --> 03:33:08.560 align:start position:0%
um i'm not going to take up too much of
 
03:33:11.349 --> 03:33:11.359 align:start position:0%
your time uh and just echo much of what
 
03:33:13.030 --> 03:33:13.040 align:start position:0%
mr pollock said about really
 
03:33:14.389 --> 03:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
appreciating the work that's gone into
 
03:33:16.070 --> 03:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
this and being in general support of the
 
03:33:16.080 --> 03:33:17.429 align:start position:0%
this and being in general support of the
bill

03:33:17.429 --> 03:33:17.439 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:33:19.030 --> 03:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
clean energy new hampshire is a
 
03:33:21.750 --> 03:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
non-profit member-based organization we
 
03:33:23.590 --> 03:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
are new hampshire's leading clean energy
 
03:33:25.429 --> 03:33:25.439 align:start position:0%
advocate that's dedicated to supporting
 
03:33:27.349 --> 03:33:27.359 align:start position:0%
policies and programs that strengthen
 
03:33:28.790 --> 03:33:28.800 align:start position:0%
our state's economy
 
03:33:31.110 --> 03:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
by encouraging a transition to renewable
 
03:33:33.830 --> 03:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
energy and promoting energy efficiency
 
03:33:36.550 --> 03:33:36.560 align:start position:0%
and we're particularly uh
 
03:33:39.110 --> 03:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
in support of the energy components that
 
03:33:42.630 --> 03:33:42.640 align:start position:0%
are within this bill it would update
 
03:33:44.710 --> 03:33:44.720 align:start position:0%
us from the 2015
 
03:33:46.950 --> 03:33:46.960 align:start position:0%
international energy conservation code
 
03:33:49.590 --> 03:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
to the 2018 code but with very little in
 
03:33:51.429 --> 03:33:51.439 align:start position:0%
the way of amendments that would reduce
 
03:33:54.070 --> 03:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
the efficiency of new buildings or
 
03:33:55.750 --> 03:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
significant renovations
 
03:33:58.950 --> 03:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
in light of this winter which has been
 
03:34:01.510 --> 03:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
actually the as cold as winters had been
 
03:34:04.070 --> 03:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
uh in the past um and with the higher
 
03:34:05.830 --> 03:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
energy bills we're seeing because of
 
03:34:07.510 --> 03:34:07.520 align:start position:0%
changes in the global energy market and
 
03:34:09.750 --> 03:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
the draw of natural gas to other places
 
03:34:12.469 --> 03:34:12.479 align:start position:0%
which have driven up prices overall
 
03:34:14.229 --> 03:34:14.239 align:start position:0%
continuous improvement in our energy
 
03:34:16.630 --> 03:34:16.640 align:start position:0%
efficiency will insulate new hampshire
 
03:34:16.640 --> 03:34:17.910 align:start position:0%
efficiency will insulate new hampshire
homeowners

03:34:17.910 --> 03:34:17.920 align:start position:0%
homeowners
 
03:34:20.710 --> 03:34:20.720 align:start position:0%
renters and businesses from any further
 
03:34:23.750 --> 03:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
changes or rises in energy costs while
 
03:34:26.469 --> 03:34:26.479 align:start position:0%
also protecting them from energy costs
 
03:34:29.429 --> 03:34:29.439 align:start position:0%
during the summers which have been
 
03:34:31.190 --> 03:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
warm and increasing in the
 
03:34:32.630 --> 03:34:32.640 align:start position:0%
cooling demand
 
03:34:35.349 --> 03:34:35.359 align:start position:0%
so in general we're in support of seeing
 
03:34:37.269 --> 03:34:37.279 align:start position:0%
the energy code included
 
03:34:40.309 --> 03:34:40.319 align:start position:0%
in previous editions it has been an area
 
03:34:43.110 --> 03:34:43.120 align:start position:0%
of concern for many of the stakeholders
 
03:34:45.110 --> 03:34:45.120 align:start position:0%
but through the work of
 
03:34:48.469 --> 03:34:48.479 align:start position:0%
chairman mcguire and senator
 
03:34:50.469 --> 03:34:50.479 align:start position:0%
carson as well as the stakeholders
 
03:34:52.950 --> 03:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
behind us we've been able to reach a
 
03:34:54.309 --> 03:34:54.319 align:start position:0%
process where
 
03:34:56.229 --> 03:34:56.239 align:start position:0%
we have found agreement on how to move
 
03:34:57.990 --> 03:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
forward on this code
 
03:35:00.070 --> 03:35:00.080 align:start position:0%
in addition to all the others in
 
03:35:00.080 --> 03:35:01.510 align:start position:0%
in addition to all the others in
sync

03:35:01.510 --> 03:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
sync
 
03:35:06.950 --> 03:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:10.150 --> 03:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
does anybody have any questions nope
 
03:35:14.469 --> 03:35:14.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:15.910 --> 03:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
are there any other members from the
 
03:35:17.590 --> 03:35:17.600 align:start position:0%
public that wish to testify on house
 
03:35:22.710 --> 03:35:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:49.910 --> 03:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:52.870 --> 03:45:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:55.269 --> 03:45:55.279 align:start position:0%
we will now open the
 
03:45:58.070 --> 03:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
hearing for house bill 1191 the
 
03:46:00.070 --> 03:46:00.080 align:start position:0%

pittsfield
 
03:46:12.630 --> 03:46:12.640 align:start position:0%
and house bill 191 was put in at the
 
03:46:14.389 --> 03:46:14.399 align:start position:0%
request of a friend
 
03:46:17.030 --> 03:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
who had just bought a duplex and was
 
03:46:21.189 --> 03:46:21.199 align:start position:0%
renovating it as his primary residence
 
03:46:24.070 --> 03:46:24.080 align:start position:0%
and as a retired electrician he was
 
03:46:26.070 --> 03:46:26.080 align:start position:0%
going to do most of the electrical work
 
03:46:26.080 --> 03:46:27.429 align:start position:0%
going to do most of the electrical work
himself

03:46:27.429 --> 03:46:27.439 align:start position:0%
himself
 
03:46:29.750 --> 03:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
until he found out that he could not get
 
03:46:32.950 --> 03:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
a building permit to do that work
 
03:46:35.110 --> 03:46:35.120 align:start position:0%
because he was no longer licensed he's
 
03:46:35.120 --> 03:46:36.389 align:start position:0%
because he was no longer licensed he's
retired

03:46:36.389 --> 03:46:36.399 align:start position:0%
retired
 
03:46:38.309 --> 03:46:38.319 align:start position:0%
and it was a two family and therefore
 
03:46:41.750 --> 03:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
the homeowner's exemption does not apply
 
03:46:41.760 --> 03:46:43.670 align:start position:0%
the homeowner's exemption does not apply
so

03:46:43.670 --> 03:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:46:45.830 --> 03:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
that seemed a little much so i
 
03:46:48.870 --> 03:46:48.880 align:start position:0%
put this in to
 
03:46:50.870 --> 03:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
exempt the
 
03:46:53.990 --> 03:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
two lines of work that homeowners can do
 
03:46:57.110 --> 03:46:57.120 align:start position:0%
around their house that is mechanical
 
03:46:57.120 --> 03:46:57.990 align:start position:0%
around their house that is mechanical
and

03:46:57.990 --> 03:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:46:58.000 --> 03:46:59.590 align:start position:0%
and
electrical

03:46:59.590 --> 03:46:59.600 align:start position:0%
electrical
 
03:47:03.670 --> 03:47:03.680 align:start position:0%
and expanded it to a single structure
 
03:47:07.910 --> 03:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
to family home as well as a one family
 
03:47:10.389 --> 03:47:10.399 align:start position:0%
one concern that we had
 
03:47:13.990 --> 03:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
when we were talking about it is that
 
03:47:16.870 --> 03:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
the codes required him to turn his two
 
03:47:19.189 --> 03:47:19.199 align:start position:0%
two-family home into a one-family home
 
03:47:21.110 --> 03:47:21.120 align:start position:0%
thereby destroying
 
03:47:21.120 --> 03:47:22.230 align:start position:0%
thereby destroying
a

03:47:22.230 --> 03:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:47:22.240 --> 03:47:23.590 align:start position:0%
a
[Music]

03:47:23.590 --> 03:47:23.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:47:26.950 --> 03:47:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:29.510 --> 03:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
dwelling unit which is a concern he was
 
03:47:31.670 --> 03:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
also hoping to rent the other side of
 
03:47:33.510 --> 03:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
the duplex
 
03:47:36.229 --> 03:47:36.239 align:start position:0%
and the and then we have recently
 
03:47:38.630 --> 03:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
required towns to allow accessory
 
03:47:41.830 --> 03:47:41.840 align:start position:0%
dwelling units to be built
 
03:47:44.830 --> 03:47:44.840 align:start position:0%
so that if for example
 
03:47:48.150 --> 03:47:48.160 align:start position:0%
your sectioning off a part of your home
 
03:47:50.630 --> 03:47:50.640 align:start position:0%
for a caretaker or your grandparents or
 
03:47:53.990 --> 03:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
your grandchildren or whomever
 
03:47:56.389 --> 03:47:56.399 align:start position:0%
you have to hire a licensed plumber and
 
03:47:58.830 --> 03:47:58.840 align:start position:0%
a licensed electrician to do to do the
 
03:48:01.990 --> 03:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
work even though you could
 
03:48:04.150 --> 03:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
before you divide subdivided you could
 
03:48:05.590 --> 03:48:05.600 align:start position:0%
do it yourself
 
03:48:05.600 --> 03:48:06.550 align:start position:0%
do it yourself
so

03:48:06.550 --> 03:48:06.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:48:09.990 --> 03:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
that seemed incongruous to me so i'm i'm
 
03:48:12.950 --> 03:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:15.590 --> 03:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
to bring this to the attention of
 
03:48:17.030 --> 03:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of people
 
03:48:19.590 --> 03:48:19.600 align:start position:0%
to see if this is exactly is actually
 
03:48:23.349 --> 03:48:23.359 align:start position:0%
what we want to do regarding exemptions
 
03:48:25.110 --> 03:48:25.120 align:start position:0%
the other thing is when i was looking at
 
03:48:27.830 --> 03:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
the homeowner's exemptions i discovered
 
03:48:27.840 --> 03:48:31.429 align:start position:0%
the homeowner's exemptions i discovered
the

03:48:31.429 --> 03:48:31.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:33.830 --> 03:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
electrical code is pretty clear about it
 
03:48:33.840 --> 03:48:35.030 align:start position:0%
electrical code is pretty clear about it
the

03:48:35.030 --> 03:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:48:39.510 --> 03:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
plumbing code in its penalties for
 
03:48:40.830 --> 03:48:40.840 align:start position:0%
plumbing without a
 
03:48:44.309 --> 03:48:44.319 align:start position:0%
license does not mention the exemptions
 
03:48:46.550 --> 03:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
that are in statute like
 
03:48:47.830 --> 03:48:47.840 align:start position:0%
being a
 
03:48:47.840 --> 03:48:49.110 align:start position:0%
being a
a

03:48:49.110 --> 03:48:49.120 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:48:52.389 --> 03:48:52.399 align:start position:0%
school of of plumbing or a homeowner in
 
03:48:54.790 --> 03:48:54.800 align:start position:0%
your own building whatever
 
03:48:56.710 --> 03:48:56.720 align:start position:0%
so i changed
 
03:48:58.790 --> 03:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
the penalties to
 
03:49:02.870 --> 03:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
explicitly recognize the exemptions
 
03:49:05.269 --> 03:49:05.279 align:start position:0%
and i will answer questions as i can i
 
03:49:06.950 --> 03:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
believe there are some real experts
 
03:49:10.550 --> 03:49:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:12.950 --> 03:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire if i if i may ask
 
03:49:12.960 --> 03:49:14.070 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire if i if i may ask
um

03:49:14.070 --> 03:49:14.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:16.630 --> 03:49:16.640 align:start position:0%
a question real fast so
 
03:49:18.870 --> 03:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
i recognize the
 
03:49:20.550 --> 03:49:20.560 align:start position:0%
you know the homeowner living in one
 
03:49:22.469 --> 03:49:22.479 align:start position:0%
side of let's say it's a duplex and then
 
03:49:24.790 --> 03:49:24.800 align:start position:0%
wanting to run out the other side so is
 
03:49:27.189 --> 03:49:27.199 align:start position:0%
there was there any discussion when this
 
03:49:29.269 --> 03:49:29.279 align:start position:0%
bill was being drafted what i'm going to
 
03:49:32.309 --> 03:49:32.319 align:start position:0%
call a loophole as the person lives in
 
03:49:33.830 --> 03:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
the one side
 
03:49:36.150 --> 03:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
does the work on both sides and then a
 
03:49:40.550 --> 03:49:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:42.469 --> 03:49:42.479 align:start position:0%
well since the
 
03:49:45.189 --> 03:49:45.199 align:start position:0%
personal working does not exempt anyone
 
03:49:46.950 --> 03:49:46.960 align:start position:0%
from the requirements
 
03:49:49.429 --> 03:49:49.439 align:start position:0%
for inspection of plumbing or electrical
 
03:49:49.439 --> 03:49:51.110 align:start position:0%

work
i

03:49:51.830 --> 03:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:49:54.070 --> 03:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
there was not any that was mentioned and
 
03:49:57.189 --> 03:49:57.199 align:start position:0%
we said well that's a rare occurrence
 
03:50:00.070 --> 03:50:00.080 align:start position:0%
if we're getting the work done to code
 
03:50:02.389 --> 03:50:02.399 align:start position:0%
which is one of the requirements and it
 
03:50:04.469 --> 03:50:04.479 align:start position:0%
properly inspected then we don't think
 
03:50:06.790 --> 03:50:06.800 align:start position:0%
there's an issue with it
 
03:50:09.590 --> 03:50:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:11.510 --> 03:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
representative marsh
 
03:50:12.950 --> 03:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
03:50:15.030 --> 03:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question my question regards
 
03:50:18.150 --> 03:50:18.160 align:start position:0%
the language on line 6 and line 17 where
 
03:50:20.389 --> 03:50:20.399 align:start position:0%
it's provided the person owns the entire
 
03:50:22.870 --> 03:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
structure um
 
03:50:24.469 --> 03:50:24.479 align:start position:0%
how does that interact with the fact
 
03:50:27.110 --> 03:50:27.120 align:start position:0%
that most people buy their houses using
 
03:50:28.469 --> 03:50:28.479 align:start position:0%
a mortgage and therefore may not
 
03:50:30.550 --> 03:50:30.560 align:start position:0%
actually own the structure uh in
 
03:50:32.870 --> 03:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
entirety at a certain point in time ah
 
03:50:34.550 --> 03:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
well i think you're considered
 
03:50:36.710 --> 03:50:36.720 align:start position:0%
you have a debt but you own the you're
 
03:50:38.550 --> 03:50:38.560 align:start position:0%
considered the owner even if you have a
 
03:50:38.560 --> 03:50:39.590 align:start position:0%
considered the owner even if you have a
mortgage

03:50:39.590 --> 03:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
mortgage
 
03:50:43.030 --> 03:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
and the point was raised that in
 
03:50:46.150 --> 03:50:46.160 align:start position:0%
some cases of duplexes they are separate
 
03:50:48.710 --> 03:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
deeds and one person can own one side
 
03:50:50.469 --> 03:50:50.479 align:start position:0%
and a different person can own the other
 
03:50:53.590 --> 03:50:53.600 align:start position:0%
side and
 
03:50:55.189 --> 03:50:55.199 align:start position:0%
some of the people i talked to were
 
03:50:56.950 --> 03:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
concerned that
 
03:50:59.670 --> 03:50:59.680 align:start position:0%
the other owner might not be willing to
 
03:51:02.070 --> 03:51:02.080 align:start position:0%
have an unlicensed person working on
 
03:51:03.990 --> 03:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
their house on
 
03:51:05.670 --> 03:51:05.680 align:start position:0%
on the house that they shared a wall
 
03:51:09.349 --> 03:51:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:12.229 --> 03:51:12.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for the clarification
 
03:51:14.710 --> 03:51:14.720 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
03:51:18.550 --> 03:51:18.560 align:start position:0%
thank you um my question is just about
 
03:51:20.630 --> 03:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
you mentioned something about like an
 
03:51:24.309 --> 03:51:24.319 align:start position:0%
ancillary structure on the property so
 
03:51:26.790 --> 03:51:26.800 align:start position:0%
um you could have a situation where
 
03:51:28.870 --> 03:51:28.880 align:start position:0%
somebody owns a home and they live in
 
03:51:31.590 --> 03:51:31.600 align:start position:0%
the house but the garage is separate and
 
03:51:34.070 --> 03:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
there's an apartment in the garage and
 
03:51:36.150 --> 03:51:36.160 align:start position:0%
when i read this
 
03:51:38.389 --> 03:51:38.399 align:start position:0%
i would not think that the garage and
 
03:51:41.269 --> 03:51:41.279 align:start position:0%
the house are the same structure so
 
03:51:43.349 --> 03:51:43.359 align:start position:0%
is it your intent that it applies to the
 
03:51:45.910 --> 03:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
garage department or not as written it
 
03:51:48.630 --> 03:51:48.640 align:start position:0%
wouldn't because it's a because
 
03:51:50.630 --> 03:51:50.640 align:start position:0%
unless the person was renovating the
 
03:51:52.229 --> 03:51:52.239 align:start position:0%
garage for an apartment with the
 
03:51:55.110 --> 03:51:55.120 align:start position:0%
intention of moving into the garage
 
03:51:56.790 --> 03:51:56.800 align:start position:0%
and giving their you know let their kids
 
03:51:59.269 --> 03:51:59.279 align:start position:0%
have the house but in general if you're
 
03:52:04.150 --> 03:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
if you're cr if you have a stand-alone
 
03:52:06.389 --> 03:52:06.399 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling unit it would not be
 
03:52:06.399 --> 03:52:12.389 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling unit it would not be
considered

03:52:12.389 --> 03:52:12.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:12.399 --> 03:52:15.510 align:start position:0%

03:52:15.510 --> 03:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:16.710 --> 03:52:16.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:52:18.710 --> 03:52:18.720 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
03:52:21.990 --> 03:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire just just so i'm
 
03:52:23.990 --> 03:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
understanding what
 
03:52:25.990 --> 03:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
was previously asked here in the in the
 
03:52:29.349 --> 03:52:29.359 align:start position:0%
sense of a duplex that is
 
03:52:31.510 --> 03:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
owned because it is an entire structure
 
03:52:33.030 --> 03:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
that is owned by someone else on the
 
03:52:35.110 --> 03:52:35.120 align:start position:0%
other side
 
03:52:39.750 --> 03:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:42.710 --> 03:52:42.720 align:start position:0%
for this purpose as no a single family
 
03:52:45.349 --> 03:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
it would know no it specifically says
 
03:52:47.510 --> 03:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
that the person
 
03:52:50.309 --> 03:52:50.319 align:start position:0%
owns the entire structure
 
03:52:52.630 --> 03:52:52.640 align:start position:0%
so if you have a duplex and i get the
 
03:52:54.309 --> 03:52:54.319 align:start position:0%
definition of structure believe me but
 
03:52:56.469 --> 03:52:56.479 align:start position:0%
it's it's just that sometimes the words
 
03:52:58.389 --> 03:52:58.399 align:start position:0%
that we apply definitions to words that
 
03:52:58.399 --> 03:52:59.110 align:start position:0%
that we apply definitions to words that
in

03:52:59.110 --> 03:52:59.120 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:53:00.630 --> 03:53:00.640 align:start position:0%
the law don't necessarily mean what they
 
03:53:02.309 --> 03:53:02.319 align:start position:0%
think they mean and that's my purpose of
 
03:53:05.269 --> 03:53:05.279 align:start position:0%
clarification no it's that the intent
 
03:53:06.950 --> 03:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
would be that if you have a
 
03:53:09.429 --> 03:53:09.439 align:start position:0%
a duplex that is owned by
 
03:53:11.429 --> 03:53:11.439 align:start position:0%
a single structure duplex owned by two
 
03:53:12.950 --> 03:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
two entities
 
03:53:15.750 --> 03:53:15.760 align:start position:0%
this exemption would not apply
 
03:53:16.710 --> 03:53:16.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:53:18.389 --> 03:53:18.399 align:start position:0%
and i have a second follow-up thank you
 
03:53:19.670 --> 03:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
it's not really a follow-up second line
 
03:53:21.110 --> 03:53:21.120 align:start position:0%
of questioning
 
03:53:22.950 --> 03:53:22.960 align:start position:0%
the accessory dwelling unit
 
03:53:24.630 --> 03:53:24.640 align:start position:0%
which has become a
 
03:53:29.510 --> 03:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:32.150 --> 03:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't it that
 
03:53:33.990 --> 03:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
because i'm not familiar with the how
 
03:53:35.510 --> 03:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
accessory drilling units are classified
 
03:53:37.910 --> 03:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
tonight this may be for you or not but
 
03:53:39.189 --> 03:53:39.199 align:start position:0%
does that now
 
03:53:41.990 --> 03:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
count as a two family or is does that
 
03:53:42.000 --> 03:53:44.790 align:start position:0%
count as a two family or is does that
specifically

03:53:44.790 --> 03:53:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:47.750 --> 03:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
maintain its status as a single family
 
03:53:49.510 --> 03:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
residence with the inclusion of an
 
03:53:51.990 --> 03:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling in law apartment i'm
 
03:53:55.269 --> 03:53:55.279 align:start position:0%
sure that there are details of it that
 
03:53:57.590 --> 03:53:57.600 align:start position:0%
i'm not familiar with but my
 
03:53:59.910 --> 03:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
understanding is that you are creating a
 
03:54:02.150 --> 03:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
separate dwelling unit within your house
 
03:54:04.790 --> 03:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
you're converting your house from a one
 
03:54:06.710 --> 03:54:06.720 align:start position:0%
family to a two family
 
03:54:09.030 --> 03:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
by creep putting in an adu
 
03:54:11.910 --> 03:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
and if i'm wrong then that eliminates
 
03:54:14.150 --> 03:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
some of the need for this bill but
 
03:54:15.910 --> 03:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not getting any head nods behind you
 
03:54:18.710 --> 03:54:18.720 align:start position:0%
in either direction so i i think we will
 
03:54:21.030 --> 03:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
ask other people if they know to please
 
03:54:26.070 --> 03:54:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:28.070 --> 03:54:28.080 align:start position:0%
representative bailey
 
03:54:30.830 --> 03:54:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:33.830 --> 03:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
um many of your examples featured
 
03:54:35.910 --> 03:54:35.920 align:start position:0%
electrical examples
 
03:54:37.269 --> 03:54:37.279 align:start position:0%
and yet
 
03:54:38.790 --> 03:54:38.800 align:start position:0%
electrical's not in here it's all
 
03:54:38.800 --> 03:54:40.710 align:start position:0%
electrical's not in here it's all
plumbing

03:54:40.710 --> 03:54:40.720 align:start position:0%
plumbing
 
03:54:48.550 --> 03:54:48.560 align:start position:0%

starting on line 14.
 
03:54:55.650 --> 03:54:55.660 align:start position:0%
i see yes thank you but yes there's
 
03:54:55.660 --> 03:54:57.830 align:start position:0%
i see yes thank you but yes there's
[Music]

03:54:57.830 --> 03:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:55:00.070 --> 03:55:00.080 align:start position:0%
it applies to plumbing as well just that
 
03:55:02.469 --> 03:55:02.479 align:start position:0%
my friend who started this was a retired
 
03:55:02.479 --> 03:55:07.750 align:start position:0%
my friend who started this was a retired
electrician

03:55:09.110 --> 03:55:09.120 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions from any
 
03:55:11.349 --> 03:55:11.359 align:start position:0%
of the members
 
03:55:14.870 --> 03:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative mcguire
 
03:55:32.550 --> 03:55:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:33.830 --> 03:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to speak my
 
03:55:35.510 --> 03:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
name is ted evans i'm a resident of
 
03:55:37.429 --> 03:55:37.439 align:start position:0%
concord new hampshire
 
03:55:40.469 --> 03:55:40.479 align:start position:0%
and i've spent a good part of the last
 
03:55:43.670 --> 03:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
40 years of my career in building safety
 
03:55:45.590 --> 03:55:45.600 align:start position:0%
i've been a building inspector i've been
 
03:55:48.389 --> 03:55:48.399 align:start position:0%
a plumbing inspector
 
03:55:52.550 --> 03:55:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:54.309 --> 03:55:54.319 align:start position:0%
i actually came to new hampshire 50
 
03:55:56.070 --> 03:55:56.080 align:start position:0%
years ago with the dream of building my
 
03:55:58.469 --> 03:55:58.479 align:start position:0%
own house and being able to do all the
 
03:56:01.269 --> 03:56:01.279 align:start position:0%
work associated with that house
 
03:56:03.910 --> 03:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
so i'm a firm believer in
 
03:56:04.790 --> 03:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
you know new hampshire's
 
03:56:06.710 --> 03:56:06.720 align:start position:0%
well-established right for homeowners to
 
03:56:10.229 --> 03:56:10.239 align:start position:0%
do their own work in their own
 
03:56:10.239 --> 03:56:11.670 align:start position:0%
do their own work in their own
single-family

03:56:11.670 --> 03:56:11.680 align:start position:0%
single-family
 
03:56:11.680 --> 03:56:14.950 align:start position:0%
single-family
detached

03:56:14.950 --> 03:56:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:19.030 --> 03:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:21.429 --> 03:56:21.439 align:start position:0%
but i think that if
 
03:56:23.429 --> 03:56:23.439 align:start position:0%
we have to understand that people are
 
03:56:26.550 --> 03:56:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:28.309 --> 03:56:28.319 align:start position:0%
under certain exemptions but they must
 
03:56:30.710 --> 03:56:30.720 align:start position:0%
comply with the code
 
03:56:32.150 --> 03:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
the law doesn't say they have to get
 
03:56:32.160 --> 03:56:33.990 align:start position:0%
the law doesn't say they have to get
inspections

03:56:33.990 --> 03:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
inspections
 
03:56:36.070 --> 03:56:36.080 align:start position:0%
the code says we have to get inspections
 
03:56:38.070 --> 03:56:38.080 align:start position:0%
but the code is not enforced in every
 
03:56:39.750 --> 03:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
community in new hampshire we have to
 
03:56:41.189 --> 03:56:41.199 align:start position:0%
remember that
 
03:56:43.750 --> 03:56:43.760 align:start position:0%
that we have maybe 60 70 percent
 
03:56:46.070 --> 03:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
coverage in new hampshire as far as
 
03:56:48.550 --> 03:56:48.560 align:start position:0%
permits and inspections for this kind of
 
03:56:48.560 --> 03:56:49.429 align:start position:0%
permits and inspections for this kind of
work

03:56:49.429 --> 03:56:49.439 align:start position:0%
work
 
03:56:51.110 --> 03:56:51.120 align:start position:0%
and a good part of new hampshire has
 
03:56:51.120 --> 03:56:52.469 align:start position:0%
and a good part of new hampshire has
none

03:56:52.469 --> 03:56:52.479 align:start position:0%
none
 
03:56:54.309 --> 03:56:54.319 align:start position:0%
so when we allow people to do their own
 
03:56:54.319 --> 03:56:55.910 align:start position:0%
so when we allow people to do their own
work

03:56:55.910 --> 03:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
work
 
03:56:57.510 --> 03:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
and we assume they're going to follow
 
03:57:00.150 --> 03:57:00.160 align:start position:0%
the code we really have no way to verify
 
03:57:03.750 --> 03:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:06.229 --> 03:57:06.239 align:start position:0%
my thinking is if we're going to expand
 
03:57:09.189 --> 03:57:09.199 align:start position:0%
this exemption which has some merit
 
03:57:10.710 --> 03:57:10.720 align:start position:0%
although i disagree and i think you'll
 
03:57:12.469 --> 03:57:12.479 align:start position:0%
find a lot of people behind me opposed
 
03:57:15.030 --> 03:57:15.040 align:start position:0%
to this idea
 
03:57:17.590 --> 03:57:17.600 align:start position:0%
simply because it's not safe
 
03:57:19.429 --> 03:57:19.439 align:start position:0%
and if we allow this to happen in two
 
03:57:20.950 --> 03:57:20.960 align:start position:0%
family homes we're going to essentially
 
03:57:22.389 --> 03:57:22.399 align:start position:0%
double the risk
 
03:57:25.269 --> 03:57:25.279 align:start position:0%
without any increase in inspection
 
03:57:26.710 --> 03:57:26.720 align:start position:0%
performance or inspection
 
03:57:30.070 --> 03:57:30.080 align:start position:0%
responsibilities by these exempt
 
03:57:30.080 --> 03:57:31.429 align:start position:0%
responsibilities by these exempt
people

03:57:31.429 --> 03:57:31.439 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:57:33.189 --> 03:57:33.199 align:start position:0%
and it's not just electricians putting a
 
03:57:35.030 --> 03:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
few receptacles in
 
03:57:37.110 --> 03:57:37.120 align:start position:0%
it's not just plumbing putting a sink or
 
03:57:38.950 --> 03:57:38.960 align:start position:0%
a toilet in
 
03:57:41.189 --> 03:57:41.199 align:start position:0%
and it's not just gas fitting putting
 
03:57:43.670 --> 03:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
boilers in that are fired by gas and
 
03:57:46.389 --> 03:57:46.399 align:start position:0%
emit dangerous carbon monoxide gases if
 
03:57:49.110 --> 03:57:49.120 align:start position:0%
not done properly so there's a lot of
 
03:57:49.120 --> 03:57:50.389 align:start position:0%
not done properly so there's a lot of
risk

03:57:50.389 --> 03:57:50.399 align:start position:0%
risk
 
03:57:52.710 --> 03:57:52.720 align:start position:0%
and the only way i can see justifying
 
03:57:55.429 --> 03:57:55.439 align:start position:0%
adding to this risk by ex by expanding
 
03:57:57.990 --> 03:57:58.000 align:start position:0%
exemption is by is by making sure that
 
03:58:01.030 --> 03:58:01.040 align:start position:0%
people get their work inspected
 
03:58:02.870 --> 03:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
and that it's bound to be compliant with
 
03:58:05.030 --> 03:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
the code
 
03:58:07.110 --> 03:58:07.120 align:start position:0%
that's the most important thing for
 
03:58:09.910 --> 03:58:09.920 align:start position:0%
building safety and people safety
 
03:58:11.750 --> 03:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
so how do we do that when we don't have
 
03:58:14.150 --> 03:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
coverage for municipal inspections
 
03:58:16.229 --> 03:58:16.239 align:start position:0%
i think the law could state something to
 
03:58:17.750 --> 03:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
the effect that
 
03:58:20.389 --> 03:58:20.399 align:start position:0%
anyone exempt under these
 
03:58:23.030 --> 03:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
laws would require an inspection either
 
03:58:25.429 --> 03:58:25.439 align:start position:0%
by a municipal inspector or by some
 
03:58:27.349 --> 03:58:27.359 align:start position:0%
third-party inspector
 
03:58:29.590 --> 03:58:29.600 align:start position:0%
and put that responsibility on the one
 
03:58:31.910 --> 03:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
who's exempt from the code
 
03:58:33.910 --> 03:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
to verify that they have followed the
 
03:58:35.990 --> 03:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
code and that they've been inspected to
 
03:58:39.349 --> 03:58:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:40.870 --> 03:58:40.880 align:start position:0%
i think without that we're really
 
03:58:42.710 --> 03:58:42.720 align:start position:0%
opening the doors to a wild west
 
03:58:46.469 --> 03:58:46.479 align:start position:0%
situation even worse than we have now
 
03:58:49.510 --> 03:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
and trust me i've seen many situations
 
03:58:51.670 --> 03:58:51.680 align:start position:0%
where homeowners got themselves into
 
03:58:51.680 --> 03:58:53.189 align:start position:0%
where homeowners got themselves into
trouble

03:58:53.189 --> 03:58:53.199 align:start position:0%
trouble
 
03:58:56.389 --> 03:58:56.399 align:start position:0%
with carbon monoxide exposures
 
03:58:59.110 --> 03:58:59.120 align:start position:0%
with faulty plumbing with backflow
 
03:59:01.030 --> 03:59:01.040 align:start position:0%
prevention you know backflow is
 
03:59:02.790 --> 03:59:02.800 align:start position:0%
contaminated water coming into the
 
03:59:04.550 --> 03:59:04.560 align:start position:0%
drinking water supply
 
03:59:06.309 --> 03:59:06.319 align:start position:0%
so there's just too many dangers out
 
03:59:06.319 --> 03:59:07.269 align:start position:0%
so there's just too many dangers out
there

03:59:07.269 --> 03:59:07.279 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:59:09.990 --> 03:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
to um ignore
 
03:59:11.429 --> 03:59:11.439 align:start position:0%
and i do think
 
03:59:12.870 --> 03:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
while we're at it if we're going to
 
03:59:15.030 --> 03:59:15.040 align:start position:0%
amend the exemptions we ought to make
 
03:59:17.990 --> 03:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
them consistent from electrical plumbing
 
03:59:20.790 --> 03:59:20.800 align:start position:0%
and gas fitting there's no reason why
 
03:59:22.389 --> 03:59:22.399 align:start position:0%
the exemptions
 
03:59:24.389 --> 03:59:24.399 align:start position:0%
should be unclear
 
03:59:26.870 --> 03:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
which some of them are and different
 
03:59:29.349 --> 03:59:29.359 align:start position:0%
depending on what trade you're in
 
03:59:31.990 --> 03:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
so i think this bill needs a lot of work
 
03:59:33.590 --> 03:59:33.600 align:start position:0%
i don't want to say i'm opposed to it
 
03:59:35.830 --> 03:59:35.840 align:start position:0%
except that i'm opposed to it as written
 
03:59:37.750 --> 03:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
the concept could work if we had a
 
03:59:39.750 --> 03:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
better level of safety
 
03:59:44.870 --> 03:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:46.950 --> 03:59:46.960 align:start position:0%
representative scitec
 
03:59:49.030 --> 03:59:49.040 align:start position:0%
i've just learned something from you and
 
03:59:51.030 --> 03:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
that's that you're telling me sixty
 
03:59:53.189 --> 03:59:53.199 align:start position:0%
percent of the state or somebody will
 
03:59:55.110 --> 03:59:55.120 align:start position:0%
come in and do the work according
 
03:59:56.710 --> 03:59:56.720 align:start position:0%
supposedly according to the code and
 
03:59:59.189 --> 03:59:59.199 align:start position:0%
it's not inspected
 
04:00:00.309 --> 04:00:00.319 align:start position:0%
is that right
 
04:00:01.830 --> 04:00:01.840 align:start position:0%
well i may have thrown out a number i
 
04:00:03.670 --> 04:00:03.680 align:start position:0%
don't know that 60 percent i was saying
 
04:00:05.830 --> 04:00:05.840 align:start position:0%
60 is probably we are covered with
 
04:00:08.550 --> 04:00:08.560 align:start position:0%
inspections but maybe 40 percent is done
 
04:00:11.670 --> 04:00:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:13.990 --> 04:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
well whether you like excuse me whether
 
04:00:15.910 --> 04:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
you're licensed or not if you're not
 
04:00:15.920 --> 04:00:17.189 align:start position:0%
you're licensed or not if you're not
inspected

04:00:17.189 --> 04:00:17.199 align:start position:0%
inspected
 
04:00:19.349 --> 04:00:19.359 align:start position:0%
i have trouble with that
 
04:00:20.870 --> 04:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
the license doesn't mean anything the
 
04:00:23.429 --> 04:00:23.439 align:start position:0%
inspection means something to me but i'm
 
04:00:26.630 --> 04:00:26.640 align:start position:0%
not testifying so thanks
 
04:00:28.469 --> 04:00:28.479 align:start position:0%
representative bailey
 
04:00:29.830 --> 04:00:29.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:00:31.750 --> 04:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
i made a mistake earlier in overlooking
 
04:00:34.229 --> 04:00:34.239 align:start position:0%
the electrical at the bottom
 
04:00:34.239 --> 04:00:35.269 align:start position:0%
the electrical at the bottom
i

04:00:35.269 --> 04:00:35.279 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:00:37.189 --> 04:00:37.199 align:start position:0%
draw your attention to lines eight and
 
04:00:40.070 --> 04:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
nine where they must use the applicable
 
04:00:42.309 --> 04:00:42.319 align:start position:0%
code application and inspection
 
04:00:44.229 --> 04:00:44.239 align:start position:0%
requirements wouldn't they have to have
 
04:00:46.469 --> 04:00:46.479 align:start position:0%
it inspected under that there are many
 
04:00:47.990 --> 04:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
towns excuse me but there are many towns
 
04:00:49.349 --> 04:00:49.359 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire that have no code
 
04:00:51.269 --> 04:00:51.279 align:start position:0%
enforcement whatsoever
 
04:00:54.229 --> 04:00:54.239 align:start position:0%
so how do they get those inspections
 
04:00:55.910 --> 04:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
yeah with or without a licensed
 
04:00:57.990 --> 04:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
electrician yeah
 
04:01:04.950 --> 04:01:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:08.550 --> 04:01:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:10.710 --> 04:01:10.720 align:start position:0%
you stimulated my mind representative
 
04:01:12.229 --> 04:01:12.239 align:start position:0%
hill with that
 
04:01:14.630 --> 04:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
particular question but
 
04:01:16.550 --> 04:01:16.560 align:start position:0%
would it be true sir
 
04:01:19.750 --> 04:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
if uh something went awry even though
 
04:01:22.150 --> 04:01:22.160 align:start position:0%
there's no building instructor uh
 
04:01:25.110 --> 04:01:25.120 align:start position:0%
inspector in that particular community
 
04:01:27.750 --> 04:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
and something went awry that
 
04:01:29.670 --> 04:01:29.680 align:start position:0%
particular provider if he's licensed
 
04:01:32.790 --> 04:01:32.800 align:start position:0%
could risk losing his license if he
 
04:01:35.510 --> 04:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
wired or plumbed in something
 
04:01:37.830 --> 04:01:37.840 align:start position:0%
not by the current code accepted by the
 
04:01:39.990 --> 04:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
state correct
 
04:01:41.750 --> 04:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
someone's license could be at risk if
 
04:01:48.070 --> 04:01:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:52.150 --> 04:01:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:53.990 --> 04:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
04:01:56.150 --> 04:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:02:21.269 --> 04:02:21.279 align:start position:0%

04:02:41.349 --> 04:02:41.359 align:start position:0%
i'm also part of the

plumbers and fuel gas association that
 
04:02:47.429 --> 04:02:47.439 align:start position:0%
represents about 300 licensees in the

gas and plumbing industry
 
04:02:53.750 --> 04:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
and as i put down on my my slip
 
04:02:56.389 --> 04:02:56.399 align:start position:0%
that i'm representing myself but i'm
 
04:02:58.309 --> 04:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
also representing the gas
 
04:03:00.710 --> 04:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
association where as
 
04:03:03.030 --> 04:03:03.040 align:start position:0%
this bill is written
 
04:03:04.229 --> 04:03:04.239 align:start position:0%
as it's written right now the
 
04:03:07.269 --> 04:03:07.279 align:start position:0%
association is opposed to this to this
 
04:03:07.279 --> 04:03:08.550 align:start position:0%
association is opposed to this to this
bill

04:03:08.550 --> 04:03:08.560 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:03:12.309 --> 04:03:12.319 align:start position:0%
um in general um
 
04:03:14.550 --> 04:03:14.560 align:start position:0%
expanding the ex the exemption for
 
04:03:18.229 --> 04:03:18.239 align:start position:0%
plumbing into in the gas is is extremely
 
04:03:20.710 --> 04:03:20.720 align:start position:0%
dangerous in our opinion
 
04:03:23.269 --> 04:03:23.279 align:start position:0%
we're currently dealing with a lot of
 
04:03:24.469 --> 04:03:24.479 align:start position:0%
it seems like
 
04:03:26.630 --> 04:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
in the last year or so there's a lot of
 
04:03:28.070 --> 04:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
house flippers
 
04:03:30.469 --> 04:03:30.479 align:start position:0%
and we're seeing a lot of
 
04:03:33.990 --> 04:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
systems and plumbing in on the gas that
 
04:03:39.670 --> 04:03:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:41.349 --> 04:03:41.359 align:start position:0%
some of them were installed by code some
 
04:03:42.630 --> 04:03:42.640 align:start position:0%
of them weren't some of them were
 
04:03:44.710 --> 04:03:44.720 align:start position:0%
inspected some were not inspections you
 
04:03:46.309 --> 04:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
got to remember
 
04:03:48.790 --> 04:03:48.800 align:start position:0%
permit inspection is a is a local issue
 
04:03:51.030 --> 04:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
not a state issue
 
04:03:53.030 --> 04:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
um it would be nice if we could
 
04:03:54.389 --> 04:03:54.399 align:start position:0%
strengthen up
 
04:03:55.830 --> 04:03:55.840 align:start position:0%
requiring a
 
04:03:59.910 --> 04:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:01.110 --> 04:04:01.120 align:start position:0%
if this
 
04:04:02.870 --> 04:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
the way it's written right now if this
 
04:04:04.870 --> 04:04:04.880 align:start position:0%
bill was designed
 
04:04:07.830 --> 04:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
for the accessory housing this opens it
 
04:04:11.030 --> 04:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
up to one and two families not just the
 
04:04:13.670 --> 04:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
accessory housing so we if it's going to
 
04:04:16.150 --> 04:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
be meant for the accessory housing
 
04:04:18.630 --> 04:04:18.640 align:start position:0%
then we would like to
 
04:04:20.389 --> 04:04:20.399 align:start position:0%
i think hopefully somebody will be
 
04:04:23.349 --> 04:04:23.359 align:start position:0%
offering an amendment today to amend it
 
04:04:23.359 --> 04:04:24.150 align:start position:0%
offering an amendment today to amend it
to

04:04:24.150 --> 04:04:24.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:04:27.110 --> 04:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
have it for the accessory housing
 
04:04:27.120 --> 04:04:28.630 align:start position:0%
have it for the accessory housing
and

04:04:28.630 --> 04:04:28.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:04:32.710 --> 04:04:32.720 align:start position:0%
not to be in a rental situation
 
04:04:34.790 --> 04:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
we understand that the new hampshire way
 
04:04:36.790 --> 04:04:36.800 align:start position:0%
if we want to build our own houses we
 
04:04:38.790 --> 04:04:38.800 align:start position:0%
want to be able to build our our own
 
04:04:38.800 --> 04:04:39.910 align:start position:0%
want to be able to build our our own
houses

04:04:39.910 --> 04:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
houses
 
04:04:43.590 --> 04:04:43.600 align:start position:0%
um and we're not opposed to that um
 
04:04:43.600 --> 04:04:44.389 align:start position:0%
um and we're not opposed to that um
but

04:04:44.389 --> 04:04:44.399 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:04:46.070 --> 04:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
we just need to make sure that we're
 
04:04:48.389 --> 04:04:48.399 align:start position:0%
protecting the citizens out there
 
04:04:49.990 --> 04:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
we don't want to see the
 
04:04:50.000 --> 04:04:51.510 align:start position:0%
we don't want to see the
the

04:04:51.510 --> 04:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:04:53.750 --> 04:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
you know the landlords buying two family
 
04:04:56.710 --> 04:04:56.720 align:start position:0%
houses not just duplexes two family
 
04:04:56.720 --> 04:04:57.830 align:start position:0%
houses not just duplexes two family
houses

04:04:57.830 --> 04:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
houses
 
04:05:00.469 --> 04:05:00.479 align:start position:0%
and the way this is written
 
04:05:02.950 --> 04:05:02.960 align:start position:0%
it opens it up to the two family houses
 
04:05:05.429 --> 04:05:05.439 align:start position:0%
in in manchester we have a lot of
 
04:05:07.510 --> 04:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
two family houses that
 
04:05:09.349 --> 04:05:09.359 align:start position:0%
if the owner is
 
04:05:10.870 --> 04:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
owns it
 
04:05:10.880 --> 04:05:11.990 align:start position:0%
owns it
um

04:05:11.990 --> 04:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:13.990 --> 04:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
they can do their own plumbing and gas
 
04:05:20.150 --> 04:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:22.070 --> 04:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien
 
04:05:24.469 --> 04:05:24.479 align:start position:0%
ah thank you madam chair and thank you
 
04:05:27.670 --> 04:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
sir for taking my question mr toomey
 
04:05:28.710 --> 04:05:28.720 align:start position:0%
in all
 
04:05:31.189 --> 04:05:31.199 align:start position:0%
regards within this bill plumbing do you
 
04:05:32.630 --> 04:05:32.640 align:start position:0%
think the plumbing would include
 
04:05:35.189 --> 04:05:35.199 align:start position:0%
anything that is currently large as far
 
04:05:38.389 --> 04:05:38.399 align:start position:0%
as septic systems is that would not be
 
04:05:40.630 --> 04:05:40.640 align:start position:0%
considered like plumbing
 
04:05:42.630 --> 04:05:42.640 align:start position:0%
such as a homeowner replace an
 
04:05:46.309 --> 04:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
acceptance system not uh crushing the uh
 
04:05:48.229 --> 04:05:48.239 align:start position:0%
the existing tank if he made a
 
04:05:50.229 --> 04:05:50.239 align:start position:0%
changeover or whatever
 
04:05:52.150 --> 04:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
so in new hampshire our plumbing law
 
04:05:53.670 --> 04:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
ends about
 
04:05:55.670 --> 04:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
10 feet outside the foundation
 
04:05:57.990 --> 04:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
so the septic system does not fall under
 
04:06:03.910 --> 04:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:05.830 --> 04:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
and just to answer one of your other
 
04:06:07.510 --> 04:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
questions if a plumber or gas further
 
04:06:10.229 --> 04:06:10.239 align:start position:0%
does do something that's against code
 
04:06:12.870 --> 04:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
they they are opening themselves up to
 
04:06:12.880 --> 04:06:13.910 align:start position:0%
they they are opening themselves up to
either

04:06:13.910 --> 04:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
either
 
04:06:16.550 --> 04:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
sanctions on their license or
 
04:06:18.950 --> 04:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
losing their license or it could be a
 
04:06:20.630 --> 04:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor and if there's somebody that
 
04:06:25.269 --> 04:06:25.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:27.750 --> 04:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
representative grota
 
04:06:29.429 --> 04:06:29.439 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
04:06:32.229 --> 04:06:32.239 align:start position:0%
mr trombley you had mentioned duplex and
 
04:06:34.070 --> 04:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
you had mentioned two family homes so
 
04:06:35.910 --> 04:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
could you tell me is a duplex a
 
04:06:37.349 --> 04:06:37.359 align:start position:0%
two-family home or is that something
 
04:06:37.359 --> 04:06:38.870 align:start position:0%
two-family home or is that something
different

04:06:38.870 --> 04:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
different
 
04:06:42.389 --> 04:06:42.399 align:start position:0%
uh i don't i don't know the definitions
 
04:06:45.269 --> 04:06:45.279 align:start position:0%
in law what's a duplex and what's a
 
04:06:47.670 --> 04:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
two family a duplex to me
 
04:06:49.830 --> 04:06:49.840 align:start position:0%
is there's one owner of one side and
 
04:06:52.150 --> 04:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
another owner of the other side okay a
 
04:06:55.110 --> 04:06:55.120 align:start position:0%
true family is um
 
04:06:57.830 --> 04:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
you know one person owns the building
 
04:07:01.670 --> 04:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
um and he rents out the either
 
04:07:04.229 --> 04:07:04.239 align:start position:0%
one unit or two units
 
04:07:04.239 --> 04:07:05.510 align:start position:0%
one unit or two units
so

04:07:05.510 --> 04:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:07:07.590 --> 04:07:07.600 align:start position:0%
if it's written like here if one person
 
04:07:10.070 --> 04:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
owns the whole structure
 
04:07:12.550 --> 04:07:12.560 align:start position:0%
okay he can do the work in the one in
 
04:07:14.710 --> 04:07:14.720 align:start position:0%
two family that he rents out to one or
 
04:07:19.990 --> 04:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:21.110 --> 04:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:07:22.790 --> 04:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
04:07:23.830 --> 04:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:07:27.510 --> 04:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
um i just wanted to explore the idea of
 
04:07:30.150 --> 04:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
requiring an inspection
 
04:07:32.150 --> 04:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
so in terms of the
 
04:07:33.990 --> 04:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
plumbing and the gas
 
04:07:37.510 --> 04:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
if somebody did the you know did the
 
04:07:40.229 --> 04:07:40.239 align:start position:0%
changes made made changes on their own
 
04:07:42.389 --> 04:07:42.399 align:start position:0%
if an inspector came in
 
04:07:44.790 --> 04:07:44.800 align:start position:0%
how confident
 
04:07:45.990 --> 04:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
would you be
 
04:07:47.910 --> 04:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
that everything is okay based on what
 
04:07:49.750 --> 04:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
the inspector can see i'm just wondering
 
04:07:51.269 --> 04:07:51.279 align:start position:0%
if there are things that the inspector
 
04:07:53.110 --> 04:07:53.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to see that could be a
 
04:07:53.120 --> 04:07:56.070 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to see that could be a
hazard

04:07:56.070 --> 04:07:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:57.990 --> 04:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
trick question
 
04:07:58.000 --> 04:07:58.790 align:start position:0%
trick question
in

04:07:58.790 --> 04:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:08:01.110 --> 04:08:01.120 align:start position:0%
many in many communities
 
04:08:02.870 --> 04:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
we have professional inspectors and i
 
04:08:04.710 --> 04:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have any problems with those
 
04:08:06.950 --> 04:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
communities that have those professional
 
04:08:09.590 --> 04:08:09.600 align:start position:0%
inspectors inspecting unfortunately in
 
04:08:10.950 --> 04:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
04:08:12.950 --> 04:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of communities that do not
 
04:08:14.870 --> 04:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
have professional inspectors and they
 
04:08:17.189 --> 04:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
don't have the education it's usually
 
04:08:19.269 --> 04:08:19.279 align:start position:0%
somebody volunteering they don't have
 
04:08:20.630 --> 04:08:20.640 align:start position:0%
the knowledge in the plumbing and the
 
04:08:23.189 --> 04:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
gas and electric it's somebody that's
 
04:08:25.030 --> 04:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
kind of doing everything i actually
 
04:08:26.550 --> 04:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
think this might be another bill that
 
04:08:28.710 --> 04:08:28.720 align:start position:0%
you that you might be uh
 
04:08:30.870 --> 04:08:30.880 align:start position:0%
taking up inspectors or have taken up
 
04:08:30.880 --> 04:08:32.469 align:start position:0%
taking up inspectors or have taken up
inspectors

04:08:32.469 --> 04:08:32.479 align:start position:0%
inspectors
 
04:08:32.479 --> 04:08:33.269 align:start position:0%
inspectors
so

04:08:33.269 --> 04:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:08:35.349 --> 04:08:35.359 align:start position:0%
depends on what town or what community
 
04:08:35.359 --> 04:08:36.229 align:start position:0%
depends on what town or what community
you

04:08:36.229 --> 04:08:36.239 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:08:38.790 --> 04:08:38.800 align:start position:0%
that you're in and who's inspecting that
 
04:08:38.800 --> 04:08:40.070 align:start position:0%
that you're in and who's inspecting that
that

04:08:40.070 --> 04:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:08:41.990 --> 04:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
community i've seen
 
04:08:42.000 --> 04:08:43.269 align:start position:0%
community i've seen
personally

04:08:43.269 --> 04:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
personally
 
04:08:45.429 --> 04:08:45.439 align:start position:0%
situations that were inspected
 
04:08:48.710 --> 04:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
and i they're against code i can walk in
 
04:08:50.870 --> 04:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
i think anybody behind us can walk into
 
04:08:53.110 --> 04:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
any house right now and find something
 
04:08:55.670 --> 04:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
against code
 
04:08:57.750 --> 04:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
representative marsh
 
04:08:59.189 --> 04:08:59.199 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
04:09:01.189 --> 04:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
taking my question you had said that you
 
04:09:03.349 --> 04:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
were a licensed plumber i think i
 
04:09:06.790 --> 04:09:06.800 align:start position:0%
understand uh looking at the statutes i
 
04:09:09.110 --> 04:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
see that this bill is being put into the
 
04:09:11.030 --> 04:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
rsa that deals with the state bureau of
 
04:09:14.149 --> 04:09:14.159 align:start position:0%
fire control and this rsa that looks
 
04:09:15.670 --> 04:09:15.680 align:start position:0%
like it used to require a plumbing
 
04:09:21.830 --> 04:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
license rsa329a was repealed in 2013. so
 
04:09:23.670 --> 04:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
do you in fact need a plumbing license
 
04:09:25.830 --> 04:09:25.840 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire you do you
 
04:09:27.269 --> 04:09:27.279 align:start position:0%
need a plumbing license and a gas
 
04:09:30.070 --> 04:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
footage license so in 2013
 
04:09:34.309 --> 04:09:34.319 align:start position:0%
milia's law came into into play and the
 
04:09:36.950 --> 04:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
mecha the plumbing board was
 
04:09:39.189 --> 04:09:39.199 align:start position:0%
merged into a mechanical board with
 
04:09:41.590 --> 04:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
plumbing and gas and that's where rsa
 
04:09:45.349 --> 04:09:45.359 align:start position:0%
153 came into came into play
 
04:09:47.670 --> 04:09:47.680 align:start position:0%
we're over at the fire marshal's office
 
04:09:51.510 --> 04:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
from 2013 until july of last year
 
04:09:53.750 --> 04:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
july of last year we moved from the fire
 
04:09:57.429 --> 04:09:57.439 align:start position:0%
marshal's office over to the oplc
 
04:09:59.830 --> 04:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
so we the mechanical board which
 
04:10:05.590 --> 04:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:08.389 --> 04:10:08.399 align:start position:0%
oil insulation and water treatment is
 
04:10:08.399 --> 04:10:09.349 align:start position:0%
oil insulation and water treatment is
now

04:10:09.349 --> 04:10:09.359 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:10:13.030 --> 04:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
administrated by the oplc
 
04:10:16.389 --> 04:10:16.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:18.550 --> 04:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
uh as a follow-up question it sounds
 
04:10:21.269 --> 04:10:21.279 align:start position:0%
like you would recommend that we retitle
 
04:10:23.910 --> 04:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
this entire section of law rsa 153
 
04:10:26.229 --> 04:10:26.239 align:start position:0%
because it clearly has to do with more
 
04:10:30.070 --> 04:10:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:33.670 --> 04:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
well to work on uh 153 to
 
04:10:35.830 --> 04:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
clean up the language in the mechanical
 
04:10:39.269 --> 04:10:39.279 align:start position:0%
board there is a there is a senate bill
 
04:10:40.309 --> 04:10:40.319 align:start position:0%
that is
 
04:10:42.710 --> 04:10:42.720 align:start position:0%
in process to clean up
 
04:10:44.229 --> 04:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
to get the
 
04:10:45.429 --> 04:10:45.439 align:start position:0%
to move the
 
04:10:45.439 --> 04:10:46.710 align:start position:0%
to move the
language

04:10:46.710 --> 04:10:46.720 align:start position:0%
language
 
04:10:47.670 --> 04:10:47.680 align:start position:0%
in the
 
04:10:49.910 --> 04:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
rsa from the fire master's office over
 
04:10:51.510 --> 04:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
to the oplc
 
04:10:53.750 --> 04:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
that is already in process i think it's
 
04:10:55.910 --> 04:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
a separate type of issue that's going to
 
04:10:57.990 --> 04:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
have to come forward
 
04:10:59.030 --> 04:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:11:00.710 --> 04:11:00.720 align:start position:0%
representative lekkas
 
04:11:02.630 --> 04:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
thank you i just want to make sure i
 
04:11:04.950 --> 04:11:04.960 align:start position:0%
didn't misunderstand you i thought i
 
04:11:06.550 --> 04:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
heard you say that
 
04:11:09.269 --> 04:11:09.279 align:start position:0%
um you thought somebody could do the
 
04:11:11.189 --> 04:11:11.199 align:start position:0%
whole structure do the work on both
 
04:11:13.189 --> 04:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
parts of a two family and rent them both
 
04:11:13.199 --> 04:11:15.670 align:start position:0%
parts of a two family and rent them both
out

04:11:15.670 --> 04:11:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:17.189 --> 04:11:17.199 align:start position:0%
but the question is is that what you
 
04:11:18.630 --> 04:11:18.640 align:start position:0%
meant because if you look at lines three
 
04:11:19.990 --> 04:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
through five it indicates that the
 
04:11:21.510 --> 04:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
person doing the work has to have that
 
04:11:23.189 --> 04:11:23.199 align:start position:0%
as their primary residence
 
04:11:26.070 --> 04:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i didn't see that in line four
 
04:11:29.429 --> 04:11:29.439 align:start position:0%
of occupied but still on a two-family
 
04:11:32.550 --> 04:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
house you can occupy the first floor
 
04:11:35.110 --> 04:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
and rent out the second floor
 
04:11:35.120 --> 04:11:36.229 align:start position:0%
and rent out the second floor
and

04:11:36.229 --> 04:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:11:37.510 --> 04:11:37.520 align:start position:0%
that person
 
04:11:39.990 --> 04:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
that is renting who now rents from that
 
04:11:42.469 --> 04:11:42.479 align:start position:0%
landlord from that landlord
 
04:11:45.110 --> 04:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
and in today's day and age right now
 
04:11:47.910 --> 04:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
with housing to be a big issue they
 
04:11:50.630 --> 04:11:50.640 align:start position:0%
really have if that landlord is doing
 
04:11:52.229 --> 04:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
plumbing or
 
04:11:55.349 --> 04:11:55.359 align:start position:0%
gas fitting and it's and he's
 
04:11:57.750 --> 04:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
let's say he's not getting promised
 
04:12:00.550 --> 04:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
i'm going to tell you right now
 
04:12:03.510 --> 04:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
permits are not something that happens
 
04:12:04.870 --> 04:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
uh i would say
 
04:12:07.349 --> 04:12:07.359 align:start position:0%
50 is what's happening out there from
 
04:12:09.990 --> 04:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
what i see other people and inspectors
 
04:12:12.070 --> 04:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
can kind of tell you that what's out
 
04:12:12.080 --> 04:12:13.590 align:start position:0%
can kind of tell you that what's out
there

04:12:13.590 --> 04:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:12:16.070 --> 04:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
people do work without permits i mean
 
04:12:19.349 --> 04:12:19.359 align:start position:0%
that's a fact and that's reality
 
04:12:19.359 --> 04:12:20.710 align:start position:0%
that's a fact and that's reality
the

04:12:20.710 --> 04:12:20.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:12:23.349 --> 04:12:23.359 align:start position:0%
if you're having somebody a landlord
 
04:12:25.830 --> 04:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
living in the apartment and somebody is
 
04:12:27.429 --> 04:12:27.439 align:start position:0%
renting from them
 
04:12:29.429 --> 04:12:29.439 align:start position:0%
okay that person is going to be doing
 
04:12:31.189 --> 04:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
work unlicensed
 
04:12:31.199 --> 04:12:33.349 align:start position:0%
work unlicensed
unknowledgeable

04:12:33.349 --> 04:12:33.359 align:start position:0%
unknowledgeable
 
04:12:34.790 --> 04:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
i'm in the trades i don't know
 
04:12:37.830 --> 04:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
electrical okay i wouldn't even attempt
 
04:12:40.950 --> 04:12:40.960 align:start position:0%
to do my own electrical work in my house
 
04:12:42.550 --> 04:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
04:12:42.560 --> 04:12:43.349 align:start position:0%
okay so
you

04:12:43.349 --> 04:12:43.359 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:12:46.229 --> 04:12:46.239 align:start position:0%
you try to do that with gas fitting okay
 
04:12:47.750 --> 04:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
or plumbing i know everybody thinks
 
04:12:49.990 --> 04:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
plumbing is just installing the sink or
 
04:12:52.229 --> 04:12:52.239 align:start position:0%
installing the faucet but if we're not
 
04:12:54.389 --> 04:12:54.399 align:start position:0%
inv if we're not venting that properly
 
04:12:56.149 --> 04:12:56.159 align:start position:0%
people are going to get sick
 
04:12:58.950 --> 04:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
you see people
 
04:12:58.960 --> 04:12:59.750 align:start position:0%
you see people
all

04:12:59.750 --> 04:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
all
 
04:13:02.790 --> 04:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
all the time carbon monoxide is a big
 
04:13:04.630 --> 04:13:04.640 align:start position:0%
issue that we're having it's very
 
04:13:04.640 --> 04:13:05.750 align:start position:0%
issue that we're having it's very
dangerous

04:13:05.750 --> 04:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
dangerous
 
04:13:08.630 --> 04:13:08.640 align:start position:0%
i don't like homeowners doing their own
 
04:13:11.510 --> 04:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
gas fitting period but i understand in
 
04:13:13.750 --> 04:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire we want to do our own work
 
04:13:15.269 --> 04:13:15.279 align:start position:0%
on our own house
 
04:13:17.189 --> 04:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
and i understand that and i think our
 
04:13:20.309 --> 04:13:20.319 align:start position:0%
association understands that so if they
 
04:13:22.710 --> 04:13:22.720 align:start position:0%
own the house they're having a family
 
04:13:22.720 --> 04:13:23.590 align:start position:0%
own the house they're having a family
member

04:13:23.590 --> 04:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
member
 
04:13:25.110 --> 04:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
they're building an apartment for their
 
04:13:26.870 --> 04:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
family member
 
04:13:28.950 --> 04:13:28.960 align:start position:0%
fine okay let them do their own work let
 
04:13:28.960 --> 04:13:29.670 align:start position:0%
fine okay let them do their own work let
them

04:13:29.670 --> 04:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:13:33.269 --> 04:13:33.279 align:start position:0%
put in here somehow i know it's in here
 
04:13:35.830 --> 04:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
that the permit is required okay to do
 
04:13:37.590 --> 04:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
everything by code i don't know how you
 
04:13:39.670 --> 04:13:39.680 align:start position:0%
can strengthen that that would be
 
04:13:41.510 --> 04:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
nice to figure out how to strengthen
 
04:13:42.550 --> 04:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
that up
 
04:13:42.560 --> 04:13:43.590 align:start position:0%
that up
but

04:13:43.590 --> 04:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:13:47.110 --> 04:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
don't have a landlord on the first floor
 
04:13:47.120 --> 04:13:48.550 align:start position:0%
don't have a landlord on the first floor
and

04:13:48.550 --> 04:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:13:49.750 --> 04:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
and then
 
04:13:52.149 --> 04:13:52.159 align:start position:0%
doing the work from the second floor
 
04:13:53.910 --> 04:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
what happens in the real world is that
 
04:13:55.670 --> 04:13:55.680 align:start position:0%
person moves in there for a month he's
 
04:13:57.670 --> 04:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
technically living in there then he
 
04:13:59.349 --> 04:13:59.359 align:start position:0%
moves out he does the work and he moves
 
04:13:59.359 --> 04:14:00.469 align:start position:0%
moves out he does the work and he moves
out

04:14:00.469 --> 04:14:00.479 align:start position:0%
out
 
04:14:02.229 --> 04:14:02.239 align:start position:0%
that's what's happening out there all
 
04:14:05.830 --> 04:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:07.510 --> 04:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
see no further questions
 
04:14:11.030 --> 04:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:24.389 --> 04:14:24.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:26.149 --> 04:14:26.159 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and everybody else
 
04:14:28.710 --> 04:14:28.720 align:start position:0%
i represent the mechanical board i was
 
04:14:29.910 --> 04:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
voted to
 
04:14:31.750 --> 04:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
represent them in this case
 
04:14:33.269 --> 04:14:33.279 align:start position:0%
um i am also
 
04:14:35.590 --> 04:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
a master plumber as well as
 
04:14:38.149 --> 04:14:38.159 align:start position:0%
owner of plumbing outfit
 
04:14:40.870 --> 04:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
we wanted to express that
 
04:14:42.229 --> 04:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
we do
 
04:14:44.149 --> 04:14:44.159 align:start position:0%
we do respect that somebody can do work
 
04:14:45.830 --> 04:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
on their own house but we do feel that
 
04:14:47.349 --> 04:14:47.359 align:start position:0%
there is a fine line that we have to be
 
04:14:50.229 --> 04:14:50.239 align:start position:0%
very clear of and we feel this is going
 
04:14:52.630 --> 04:14:52.640 align:start position:0%
to be a safety hazard for other people
 
04:14:54.309 --> 04:14:54.319 align:start position:0%
beyond the owner of the house or a
 
04:14:56.389 --> 04:14:56.399 align:start position:0%
potential safety hazard and we got to
 
04:14:58.070 --> 04:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
put a line somewhere and we feel that
 
04:15:00.950 --> 04:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
the line is that you can't
 
04:15:02.550 --> 04:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
be doing plumbing work
 
04:15:03.830 --> 04:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
with somebody else in the building
 
04:15:07.429 --> 04:15:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:09.349 --> 04:15:09.359 align:start position:0%
very similar to
 
04:15:09.359 --> 04:15:11.349 align:start position:0%
very similar to
huh

04:15:11.349 --> 04:15:11.359 align:start position:0%
huh
 
04:15:13.670 --> 04:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
we feel that if you're like as like
 
04:15:15.269 --> 04:15:15.279 align:start position:0%
other people before us you feel very
 
04:15:16.870 --> 04:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
strongly you own your own house it's
 
04:15:18.229 --> 04:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
your own work you're the only person
 
04:15:19.670 --> 04:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
living there we respect that very
 
04:15:19.680 --> 04:15:20.710 align:start position:0%
living there we respect that very
greatly

04:15:20.710 --> 04:15:20.720 align:start position:0%
greatly
 
04:15:22.149 --> 04:15:22.159 align:start position:0%
but we got to put a line somewhere as
 
04:15:23.750 --> 04:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
soon as it starts affecting other people
 
04:15:25.590 --> 04:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
and we feel that this is going beyond
 
04:15:27.910 --> 04:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
that work on your own house situation
 
04:15:29.590 --> 04:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
that similar to what the other people
 
04:15:30.950 --> 04:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
have said if somebody else is living
 
04:15:32.790 --> 04:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
with you no association with you they're
 
04:15:34.389 --> 04:15:34.399 align:start position:0%
just renting the space is you're
 
04:15:36.229 --> 04:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
directly affecting them with work that's
 
04:15:37.830 --> 04:15:37.840 align:start position:0%
not done by a professional someone that
 
04:15:39.670 --> 04:15:39.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the knowledge in the trade
 
04:15:41.110 --> 04:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:15:42.710 --> 04:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
you know with someone inspecting
 
04:15:42.720 --> 04:15:44.229 align:start position:0%
you know with someone inspecting
something

04:15:44.229 --> 04:15:44.239 align:start position:0%
something
 
04:15:46.790 --> 04:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
there is a level of that they can't see
 
04:15:46.800 --> 04:15:47.830 align:start position:0%
there is a level of that they can't see
everything

04:15:47.830 --> 04:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
everything
 
04:15:50.070 --> 04:15:50.080 align:start position:0%
and work being done by somebody that's
 
04:15:51.910 --> 04:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
not in the trade you know things can be
 
04:15:53.269 --> 04:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
missed and that's only if it's being
 
04:15:53.279 --> 04:15:55.189 align:start position:0%
missed and that's only if it's being
inspected

04:15:55.189 --> 04:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
inspected
 
04:15:57.910 --> 04:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
there is a high degree of
 
04:15:59.830 --> 04:15:59.840 align:start position:0%
safety concerns as they mentioned before
 
04:16:01.590 --> 04:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
carbon monoxide
 
04:16:04.550 --> 04:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
issues explosion issues safety concerns
 
04:16:06.870 --> 04:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
and on the gas side plumbing does have
 
04:16:08.790 --> 04:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
its issues as well as not just sinks and
 
04:16:11.269 --> 04:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
fossa repairs it could be
 
04:16:12.710 --> 04:16:12.720 align:start position:0%
dumping into the wrong thing you could
 
04:16:15.429 --> 04:16:15.439 align:start position:0%
have crossed water lines with um
 
04:16:16.790 --> 04:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
you could have all kinds of issues going
 
04:16:17.830 --> 04:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
on the house that could be safety
 
04:16:19.429 --> 04:16:19.439 align:start position:0%
concerns but our biggest one especially
 
04:16:20.630 --> 04:16:20.640 align:start position:0%
the gas
 
04:16:22.469 --> 04:16:22.479 align:start position:0%
potential explosions potential carbon
 
04:16:28.149 --> 04:16:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:31.269 --> 04:16:31.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:33.429 --> 04:16:33.439 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you
 
04:16:48.309 --> 04:16:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:49.590 --> 04:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the

state of new hampshire
 
04:17:04.630 --> 04:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
currently the new hampshire building
 
04:17:07.510 --> 04:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
officials association does not support
 
04:17:10.870 --> 04:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
house bill 1191 as written our primary
 
04:17:12.229 --> 04:17:12.239 align:start position:0%
objections to this bill are the
 
04:17:14.550 --> 04:17:14.560 align:start position:0%
inclusion of two family dwellings
 
04:17:15.750 --> 04:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
we support
 
04:17:17.590 --> 04:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
homeowners rights to do work in their
 
04:17:20.309 --> 04:17:20.319 align:start position:0%
own homes their own single family
 
04:17:23.269 --> 04:17:23.279 align:start position:0%
detached dwellings we do not support the
 
04:17:25.429 --> 04:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
inclusion of two family dwellings due to
 
04:17:27.429 --> 04:17:27.439 align:start position:0%
the inherent risk that can happen with
 
04:17:29.910 --> 04:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
electrical plumbing or mechanical or
 
04:17:35.269 --> 04:17:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:37.990 --> 04:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
it's often that we find in two family
 
04:17:40.309 --> 04:17:40.319 align:start position:0%
dwellings although it seems very simple
 
04:17:42.229 --> 04:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
it's just two separate dwellings that
 
04:17:44.389 --> 04:17:44.399 align:start position:0%
you would have common mechanical areas
 
04:17:45.910 --> 04:17:45.920 align:start position:0%
in a building which would include your
 
04:17:48.550 --> 04:17:48.560 align:start position:0%
electrical your plumbing and your
 
04:17:51.349 --> 04:17:51.359 align:start position:0%
mechanical gas gas connections your
 
04:17:54.389 --> 04:17:54.399 align:start position:0%
heating systems and having one one owner
 
04:17:56.149 --> 04:17:56.159 align:start position:0%
being able to work on those systems that
 
04:17:58.790 --> 04:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
could impact another another resident of
 
04:18:01.750 --> 04:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
that building outside of their family is
 
04:18:03.349 --> 04:18:03.359 align:start position:0%
is a risk that i don't think we should
 
04:18:05.269 --> 04:18:05.279 align:start position:0%
take on
 
04:18:07.750 --> 04:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
yeah we need to understand that
 
04:18:10.309 --> 04:18:10.319 align:start position:0%
there are skills needed in order to do
 
04:18:13.590 --> 04:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
electrical plumbing and gas piping
 
04:18:16.309 --> 04:18:16.319 align:start position:0%
skills that should require inspections
 
04:18:19.030 --> 04:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
in all communities we've heard today
 
04:18:21.429 --> 04:18:21.439 align:start position:0%
from other other uh
 
04:18:23.510 --> 04:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
folks before me that there aren't
 
04:18:25.349 --> 04:18:25.359 align:start position:0%
inspectors in every state in every
 
04:18:26.710 --> 04:18:26.720 align:start position:0%
community in new hampshire and that's
 
04:18:26.720 --> 04:18:28.070 align:start position:0%
community in new hampshire and that's
true

04:18:28.070 --> 04:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
true
 
04:18:29.910 --> 04:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
nhboa new hampshire building officials
 
04:18:32.469 --> 04:18:32.479 align:start position:0%
does track that statistics roughly right
 
04:18:34.710 --> 04:18:34.720 align:start position:0%
now we have about a 50 percent coverage
 
04:18:36.790 --> 04:18:36.800 align:start position:0%
for inspectors in new hampshire out of
 
04:18:38.870 --> 04:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
those out of the 50 percent of those
 
04:18:40.790 --> 04:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
communities there's a
 
04:18:40.800 --> 04:18:41.750 align:start position:0%
communities there's a
large

04:18:41.750 --> 04:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
large
 
04:18:41.760 --> 04:18:42.870 align:start position:0%
large
large

04:18:42.870 --> 04:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
large
 
04:18:44.389 --> 04:18:44.399 align:start position:0%
number of those communities that are
 
04:18:46.469 --> 04:18:46.479 align:start position:0%
part-time inspectors they aren't per
 
04:18:47.990 --> 04:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
they aren't you know professionally
 
04:18:51.349 --> 04:18:51.359 align:start position:0%
trained they aren't certified they're
 
04:18:53.750 --> 04:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
do it as a hobby on weekends and nights
 
04:18:56.070 --> 04:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
but they are called an inspector because
 
04:18:58.309 --> 04:18:58.319 align:start position:0%
the community decide to have that so we
 
04:19:00.229 --> 04:19:00.239 align:start position:0%
understand that you know to avoid the
 
04:19:02.550 --> 04:19:02.560 align:start position:0%
risks to other residents
 
04:19:05.510 --> 04:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
we should not be including two family
 
04:19:06.630 --> 04:19:06.640 align:start position:0%
into this
 
04:19:06.640 --> 04:19:08.710 align:start position:0%
into this
exception

04:19:08.710 --> 04:19:08.720 align:start position:0%
exception
 
04:19:10.550 --> 04:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
we also have a concern with accessory
 
04:19:12.389 --> 04:19:12.399 align:start position:0%
dwelling units and i think the question
 
04:19:14.550 --> 04:19:14.560 align:start position:0%
came up earlier is an accessory dwelling
 
04:19:16.630 --> 04:19:16.640 align:start position:0%
unit creating a two family dwelling yes
 
04:19:17.750 --> 04:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
it is
 
04:19:20.229 --> 04:19:20.239 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling unit is is a land use
 
04:19:22.149 --> 04:19:22.159 align:start position:0%
term that you won't find in the building
 
04:19:24.070 --> 04:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
or fire codes
 
04:19:26.309 --> 04:19:26.319 align:start position:0%
it it is a
 
04:19:28.870 --> 04:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
skirt around the codes in my view
 
04:19:30.630 --> 04:19:30.640 align:start position:0%
when you when you were actually creating
 
04:19:32.630 --> 04:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
a two-family dwelling and so when you
 
04:19:34.309 --> 04:19:34.319 align:start position:0%
make an accessory dwelling unit and
 
04:19:35.990 --> 04:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
under the current laws the accessory
 
04:19:38.389 --> 04:19:38.399 align:start position:0%
dwelling unit can be rented so it's not
 
04:19:41.189 --> 04:19:41.199 align:start position:0%
just your family impact you're impacting
 
04:19:42.710 --> 04:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
you can construct a
 
04:19:44.950 --> 04:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
an accessory dwelling unit and then rent
 
04:19:47.590 --> 04:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
that unit the next day if you wish
 
04:19:49.750 --> 04:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
that's that's a risk to somebody outside
 
04:19:51.429 --> 04:19:51.439 align:start position:0%
of your family that i don't think we
 
04:19:53.750 --> 04:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
should we should take on
 
04:19:55.429 --> 04:19:55.439 align:start position:0%
you also have heard the terms house
 
04:19:57.030 --> 04:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
flippers you probably heard the terms
 
04:19:57.040 --> 04:19:59.910 align:start position:0%
flippers you probably heard the terms
airbnbs

04:19:59.910 --> 04:19:59.920 align:start position:0%
airbnbs
 
04:20:02.389 --> 04:20:02.399 align:start position:0%
vacation rentals by owner all of these
 
04:20:04.149 --> 04:20:04.159 align:start position:0%
become an issue when we start allowing
 
04:20:05.910 --> 04:20:05.920 align:start position:0%
people to do the work in these types of
 
04:20:05.920 --> 04:20:08.710 align:start position:0%
people to do the work in these types of
structures

04:20:08.710 --> 04:20:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:11.349 --> 04:20:11.359 align:start position:0%
we work very closely i'm a code official
 
04:20:13.750 --> 04:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
of over 20 years we work very closely
 
04:20:15.349 --> 04:20:15.359 align:start position:0%
with with our homeowners when they're
 
04:20:17.429 --> 04:20:17.439 align:start position:0%
doing work in their own single family
 
04:20:17.439 --> 04:20:18.630 align:start position:0%
doing work in their own single family
homes

04:20:18.630 --> 04:20:18.640 align:start position:0%
homes
 
04:20:20.950 --> 04:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
often we find people that are that
 
04:20:22.710 --> 04:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
aren't really competent enough to be
 
04:20:24.469 --> 04:20:24.479 align:start position:0%
doing that work and we spend an awful
 
04:20:26.710 --> 04:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
lot of time educating them and teaching
 
04:20:28.550 --> 04:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
them how to do the work so that we know
 
04:20:31.110 --> 04:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
that it's up to code
 
04:20:33.830 --> 04:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
the concern we have is that we are now
 
04:20:36.149 --> 04:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
going to be allowing these people that
 
04:20:39.030 --> 04:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
may not necessarily be totally competent
 
04:20:41.189 --> 04:20:41.199 align:start position:0%
now to do work into dwellings that could
 
04:20:42.870 --> 04:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
affect someone else
 
04:20:44.870 --> 04:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
not just themselves and for that reason
 
04:20:48.469 --> 04:20:48.479 align:start position:0%
we cannot support house bill 1191
 
04:20:51.990 --> 04:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
and i'll open to any questions
 
04:20:54.950 --> 04:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
representative grota thank you mr
 
04:20:58.149 --> 04:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
mckinney i i want to go back to your um
 
04:21:00.469 --> 04:21:00.479 align:start position:0%
statistic that you mentioned so you so
 
04:21:03.189 --> 04:21:03.199 align:start position:0%
did you say 50
 
04:21:05.990 --> 04:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
of the municipalities in new hampshire
 
04:21:06.000 --> 04:21:06.830 align:start position:0%
of the municipalities in new hampshire
have

04:21:06.830 --> 04:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:21:06.840 --> 04:21:08.710 align:start position:0%
have
inspectors

04:21:08.710 --> 04:21:08.720 align:start position:0%
inspectors
 
04:21:11.110 --> 04:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
by our latest our latest
 
04:21:13.429 --> 04:21:13.439 align:start position:0%
tracking yes it's roughly 50 percent in
 
04:21:15.110 --> 04:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire that has some
 
04:21:17.830 --> 04:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
form of code enforcement
 
04:21:19.349 --> 04:21:19.359 align:start position:0%

they may contract with an outside
 
04:21:22.710 --> 04:21:22.720 align:start position:0%
company they may have a part-time
 
04:21:24.149 --> 04:21:24.159 align:start position:0%
inspector they may have full-time
 
04:21:26.309 --> 04:21:26.319 align:start position:0%
inspectors but it's roughly around 50
 
04:21:26.319 --> 04:21:28.309 align:start position:0%
inspectors but it's roughly around 50
percent

04:21:28.309 --> 04:21:28.319 align:start position:0%
percent
 
04:21:29.830 --> 04:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes
 
04:21:32.309 --> 04:21:32.319 align:start position:0%
so though those communities that don't
 
04:21:35.189 --> 04:21:35.199 align:start position:0%
have a building inspector
 
04:21:36.950 --> 04:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
how do they
 
04:21:39.429 --> 04:21:39.439 align:start position:0%
provide occupancy
 
04:21:41.830 --> 04:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
permits for the buildings that are built
 
04:21:47.429 --> 04:21:47.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:49.510 --> 04:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
well we know some communities
 
04:21:52.149 --> 04:21:52.159 align:start position:0%
do offer occupancy permits
 
04:21:55.830 --> 04:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
regardless of inspections being done
 
04:21:57.189 --> 04:21:57.199 align:start position:0%
and then other communities don't offer
 
04:22:01.750 --> 04:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:03.990 --> 04:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
that comes down to how the lending
 
04:22:06.149 --> 04:22:06.159 align:start position:0%
agencies or whether you're doing cash
 
04:22:07.910 --> 04:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
sales on homes whether that
 
04:22:11.429 --> 04:22:11.439 align:start position:0%
documentation would be required
 
04:22:14.149 --> 04:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
the state statute requires that the
 
04:22:16.550 --> 04:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
responsibility to follow code is left to
 
04:22:18.710 --> 04:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
the contractor the applicant the the
 
04:22:20.309 --> 04:22:20.319 align:start position:0%
person doing the work it's not
 
04:22:21.990 --> 04:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily the responsibility of the
 
04:22:24.389 --> 04:22:24.399 align:start position:0%
community to ensure that it meets code
 
04:22:26.950 --> 04:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
unless they have inspectors
 
04:22:29.189 --> 04:22:29.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:22:30.389 --> 04:22:30.399 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions from the
 
04:22:30.399 --> 04:22:32.309 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions from the
members

04:22:32.309 --> 04:22:32.319 align:start position:0%
members
 
04:22:34.070 --> 04:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
see none thank you for your testimony oh
 
04:22:36.469 --> 04:22:36.479 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien
 
04:22:38.389 --> 04:22:38.399 align:start position:0%
thank you man i'm sure i did have one
 
04:22:41.030 --> 04:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
and uh mr mckinney we could talk later
 
04:22:42.710 --> 04:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
but basically
 
04:22:45.110 --> 04:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh again coming from the boston area i
 
04:22:47.349 --> 04:22:47.359 align:start position:0%
thought i i never thought i would say
 
04:22:50.389 --> 04:22:50.399 align:start position:0%
you see the phenom of a three-decker
 
04:22:53.110 --> 04:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
become a condo unit
 
04:22:56.149 --> 04:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
and are we on the uh the dawning of this
 
04:22:58.309 --> 04:22:58.319 align:start position:0%
happening in the state and we
 
04:23:00.070 --> 04:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
should look at you know bills like this
 
04:23:01.910 --> 04:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
and everything else with that in mind
 
04:23:03.830 --> 04:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
because that would be three separate
 
04:23:06.630 --> 04:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
entities in one building
 
04:23:08.469 --> 04:23:08.479 align:start position:0%
correct correct and i think that's the
 
04:23:10.710 --> 04:23:10.720 align:start position:0%
important piece of of holding this to
 
04:23:13.189 --> 04:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
single family detached dwellings because
 
04:23:14.950 --> 04:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
when we still start getting into
 
04:23:17.269 --> 04:23:17.279 align:start position:0%
condominiums those are individually
 
04:23:19.030 --> 04:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
owned dwelling units but they're all
 
04:23:19.040 --> 04:23:20.309 align:start position:0%
owned dwelling units but they're all
attached

04:23:20.309 --> 04:23:20.319 align:start position:0%
attached
 
04:23:22.389 --> 04:23:22.399 align:start position:0%
so i think it's very
 
04:23:24.469 --> 04:23:24.479 align:start position:0%
important that we stay with the detached
 
04:23:30.229 --> 04:23:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:31.830 --> 04:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions from any
 
04:23:34.309 --> 04:23:34.319 align:start position:0%
of the members
 
04:23:37.510 --> 04:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
04:23:51.830 --> 04:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:53.110 --> 04:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
good afternoon madam chairman and
 
04:23:54.630 --> 04:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
committee members my name is steven
 
04:23:56.149 --> 04:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
reincourt i'm a licensed electrician in

business association
 
04:24:03.429 --> 04:24:03.439 align:start position:0%
and we're here to echo the concerns that
 
04:24:04.790 --> 04:24:04.800 align:start position:0%
have come before us we're concerned with
 
04:24:06.630 --> 04:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
the wording as it stands so we oppose
 
04:24:08.389 --> 04:24:08.399 align:start position:0%
this as written right now there's been
 
04:24:09.990 --> 04:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
some question about accessory dwellings
 
04:24:12.229 --> 04:24:12.239 align:start position:0%
and as mr mckinney spoke there's a
 
04:24:13.510 --> 04:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
there's a couple different requirements
 
04:24:15.110 --> 04:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
for accessory roles that might minimize
 
04:24:16.469 --> 04:24:16.479 align:start position:0%
it but if there was going to be some
 
04:24:18.229 --> 04:24:18.239 align:start position:0%
further discussion about that we'd be
 
04:24:20.790 --> 04:24:20.800 align:start position:0%
glad to be involved and help out but as
 
04:24:22.550 --> 04:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
it's written right now we have a lot of
 
04:24:24.469 --> 04:24:24.479 align:start position:0%
concerns with the the two family
 
04:24:24.479 --> 04:24:25.429 align:start position:0%
concerns with the the two family
because

04:24:25.429 --> 04:24:25.439 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:24:26.790 --> 04:24:26.800 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire it's live free to die
 
04:24:28.309 --> 04:24:28.319 align:start position:0%
we've always believed that
 
04:24:30.550 --> 04:24:30.560 align:start position:0%
as long as it's your family that you're
 
04:24:31.990 --> 04:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
putting at risk not somebody else and
 
04:24:33.830 --> 04:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
that was kind of the main principle of
 
04:24:35.429 --> 04:24:35.439 align:start position:0%
all these exceptions and the electrical
 
04:24:37.110 --> 04:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
as well so i'll answer any questions if
 
04:24:39.269 --> 04:24:39.279 align:start position:0%
you want
 
04:24:41.030 --> 04:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
representative scitec
 
04:24:42.950 --> 04:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
mr rancourt this really isn't to you
 
04:24:44.309 --> 04:24:44.319 align:start position:0%
it's to everybody
 
04:24:47.910 --> 04:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
why should we even allow single family
 
04:24:49.750 --> 04:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
think about this how can you put your
 
04:24:52.309 --> 04:24:52.319 align:start position:0%
own family at risk if you're clumsy or
 
04:24:55.030 --> 04:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
stupid or don't know how to do gas look
 
04:25:01.429 --> 04:25:01.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:03.110 --> 04:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
okay all right
 
04:25:05.110 --> 04:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
04:25:08.870 --> 04:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:12.630 --> 04:25:12.640 align:start position:0%

04:25:14.149 --> 04:25:14.159 align:start position:0%

04:25:29.670 --> 04:25:29.680 align:start position:0%

the very next day des sent an expect

inspector down to the establishment to
 
04:27:26.710 --> 04:27:26.720 align:start position:0%
do an inspection and they subsequently
 
04:27:28.630 --> 04:27:28.640 align:start position:0%
closed them down because
 
04:27:30.710 --> 04:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
the inspector said they didn't have a

thousand gallon grease trap

mind you
 
04:27:36.309 --> 04:27:36.319 align:start position:0%
this establishment had already had a
 
04:27:38.149 --> 04:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
license in place and had gone through
 
04:27:40.790 --> 04:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
necessary inspections to obtain that
 
04:27:42.309 --> 04:27:42.319 align:start position:0%
they had no grease issues with the
 
04:27:44.790 --> 04:27:44.800 align:start position:0%
system they had already in place
 
04:27:46.790 --> 04:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
and in any case they had a cease-selling
 
04:27:49.349 --> 04:27:49.359 align:start position:0%
food until des was satisfied
 
04:27:52.070 --> 04:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
that the issue they cited was corrected
 
04:27:53.590 --> 04:27:53.600 align:start position:0%

now i'm not an expert in waste water or

plumbing nor do i know all of the

licensing requirements of des when it

what i do know
 
04:28:09.510 --> 04:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
is that some of my constituents have
 
04:28:11.830 --> 04:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
complained to me that some of the rules
 
04:28:13.830 --> 04:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
and requirements that the es has in
 
04:28:15.830 --> 04:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
place are over and above what the
 
04:28:19.590 --> 04:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
industry requires for these systems
 
04:28:21.349 --> 04:28:21.359 align:start position:0%
one such measure of the industry
 
04:28:23.110 --> 04:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
requirements is the international
 
04:28:26.630 --> 04:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
plumber's code or ipc
 
04:28:28.870 --> 04:28:28.880 align:start position:0%

04:28:40.870 --> 04:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
the ipc establishes minimum and
 
04:28:43.349 --> 04:28:43.359 align:start position:0%
right-sized requirements prefer for
 
04:28:45.349 --> 04:28:45.359 align:start position:0%
providing safe water to buildings as
 
04:28:47.030 --> 04:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
well as safe manner in which the
 
04:28:49.030 --> 04:28:49.040 align:start position:0%
liquid-borne wastes are carried out of
 
04:28:50.389 --> 04:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
the building
 
04:28:52.790 --> 04:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
many states use the ipc as their state
 
04:28:54.389 --> 04:28:54.399 align:start position:0%
plumbing code
 
04:28:56.870 --> 04:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
i don't see any problem in using the ipc
 
04:28:58.630 --> 04:28:58.640 align:start position:0%
as rules or standards for plumbing and
 
04:29:00.149 --> 04:29:00.159 align:start position:0%
septic here in new hampshire as it
 
04:29:03.189 --> 04:29:03.199 align:start position:0%
relates to des rules especially since we
 
04:29:05.590 --> 04:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
use the ipc in our own new hampshire
 
04:29:07.030 --> 04:29:07.040 align:start position:0%
building codes
 
04:29:09.429 --> 04:29:09.439 align:start position:0%
and i don't think anyone here today
 
04:29:11.590 --> 04:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
is advocating for plumbing systems that
 
04:29:13.510 --> 04:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
will cause damage or harm to people
 
04:29:15.990 --> 04:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
businesses or the environment
 
04:29:18.309 --> 04:29:18.319 align:start position:0%
be they within a structure or outside of
 
04:29:20.070 --> 04:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
a structure
 
04:29:22.149 --> 04:29:22.159 align:start position:0%
we all want clean water and proper
 
04:29:24.309 --> 04:29:24.319 align:start position:0%
disposal of waste including and
 
04:29:26.309 --> 04:29:26.319 align:start position:0%
especially grease
 
04:29:28.550 --> 04:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
no one desires to damage their own
 
04:29:31.110 --> 04:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
septic system or cause sewage haulers
 
04:29:34.389 --> 04:29:34.399 align:start position:0%
and sewage processing plants problems
 
04:29:36.389 --> 04:29:36.399 align:start position:0%
but we should also be cognizant of what
 
04:29:38.229 --> 04:29:38.239 align:start position:0%
makes sense for the size of the
 
04:29:40.870 --> 04:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
operation that smaller systems like
 
04:29:43.429 --> 04:29:43.439 align:start position:0%
balthazars might require
 
04:29:45.349 --> 04:29:45.359 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't be telling small businesses
 
04:29:47.830 --> 04:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
that operate out of a 10 by 18 foot
 
04:29:49.590 --> 04:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
trailer or shack
 
04:29:51.189 --> 04:29:51.199 align:start position:0%
that they have to meet the same
 
04:29:54.070 --> 04:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
standards as full-sized restaurants
 
04:29:57.990 --> 04:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
they are totally different operations
 
04:30:00.630 --> 04:30:00.640 align:start position:0%
i believe that des rules need to be
 
04:30:00.640 --> 04:30:01.510 align:start position:0%
i believe that des rules need to be
better

04:30:01.510 --> 04:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
better
 
04:30:03.750 --> 04:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
need to better assess and accommodate
 
04:30:06.149 --> 04:30:06.159 align:start position:0%
small size businesses and work with
 
04:30:09.189 --> 04:30:09.199 align:start position:0%
those businesses towards right-sizing
 
04:30:11.510 --> 04:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
their plumbing and septic needs
 
04:30:14.149 --> 04:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
this is why i think the ipc rules make
 
04:30:15.429 --> 04:30:15.439 align:start position:0%
more sense
 
04:30:17.990 --> 04:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
instead of a one size fits all minimum
 
04:30:20.389 --> 04:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
of a thousand gallon grease trap
 
04:30:22.229 --> 04:30:22.239 align:start position:0%
they should be assessing things like
 
04:30:24.870 --> 04:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
water usage size of the sink usage of
 
04:30:27.349 --> 04:30:27.359 align:start position:0%
the sink size of the kitchen space and
 
04:30:30.149 --> 04:30:30.159 align:start position:0%
how grease is created and or handled by
 
04:30:31.750 --> 04:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
the establishment
 
04:30:33.510 --> 04:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
clearly smaller businesses have
 
04:30:35.830 --> 04:30:35.840 align:start position:0%
different needs and operations than
 
04:30:37.990 --> 04:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
those of larger ones
 
04:30:39.830 --> 04:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
in my recent conversations with
 
04:30:42.309 --> 04:30:42.319 align:start position:0%
representatives from des they even agree
 
04:30:44.870 --> 04:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
with me on that point
 
04:30:46.870 --> 04:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
balthazar's has friolaters that are
 
04:30:48.469 --> 04:30:48.479 align:start position:0%
self-contained they don't put that
 
04:30:50.389 --> 04:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
grease down their system
 
04:30:52.469 --> 04:30:52.479 align:start position:0%
their patrons are given disposable food
 
04:30:55.030 --> 04:30:55.040 align:start position:0%
containers plates and utensils so there
 
04:30:57.110 --> 04:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
isn't a need to wash customer dishes in
 
04:30:59.910 --> 04:30:59.920 align:start position:0%
a commercial dishwasher nonetheless
 
04:31:01.510 --> 04:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
balthazar's was threatened through
 
04:31:04.070 --> 04:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
revocation of their license to contract
 
04:31:06.550 --> 04:31:06.560 align:start position:0%
and expend for the cost of a thousand
 
04:31:08.630 --> 04:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
gallon grease trap which their own
 
04:31:11.189 --> 04:31:11.199 align:start position:0%
plumbers and septic designers said was
 
04:31:11.199 --> 04:31:13.030 align:start position:0%
plumbers and septic designers said was
oversized

04:31:13.030 --> 04:31:13.040 align:start position:0%
oversized
 
04:31:14.790 --> 04:31:14.800 align:start position:0%
based on the fact that balthazar's
 
04:31:16.870 --> 04:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't generate enough water usage in
 
04:31:19.030 --> 04:31:19.040 align:start position:0%
their system to keep the grease trap
 
04:31:21.590 --> 04:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
from going stagnant that means the
 
04:31:24.229 --> 04:31:24.239 align:start position:0%
system will be prone to breed unhealthy
 
04:31:27.910 --> 04:31:27.920 align:start position:0%
bacteria odors and other problems i can
 
04:31:30.469 --> 04:31:30.479 align:start position:0%
only imagine other small businesses that
 
04:31:32.550 --> 04:31:32.560 align:start position:0%
have had this huge expense thrust upon
 
04:31:34.950 --> 04:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
them and then had problems going forward
 
04:31:37.670 --> 04:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
from it with regard to maintenance
 
04:31:39.189 --> 04:31:39.199 align:start position:0%
then there are other businesses that
 
04:31:41.590 --> 04:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
were forced to close or never even
 
04:31:43.750 --> 04:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
opened because their establishment
 
04:31:45.349 --> 04:31:45.359 align:start position:0%
couldn't do enough business to ever
 
04:31:49.110 --> 04:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
repay back this sort of investment
 
04:31:51.189 --> 04:31:51.199 align:start position:0%
i know of a dairy farm that wanted to
 
04:31:53.590 --> 04:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
scoop some ice cream out of his shed
 
04:31:55.670 --> 04:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
and the septic and food licensing rules
 
04:31:59.110 --> 04:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
that des and dhhs have in place were so
 
04:32:01.910 --> 04:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
onerous for this simple operation that
 
04:32:03.990 --> 04:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
the dairy farmer backed off because the
 
04:32:06.070 --> 04:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
investment was just unreasonable for
 
04:32:06.080 --> 04:32:07.349 align:start position:0%
investment was just unreasonable for
them

04:32:07.349 --> 04:32:07.359 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:32:08.790 --> 04:32:08.800 align:start position:0%
is this how we encourage
 
04:32:08.800 --> 04:32:10.710 align:start position:0%
is this how we encourage
entrepreneurship

04:32:10.710 --> 04:32:10.720 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurship
 
04:32:12.630 --> 04:32:12.640 align:start position:0%
we need to take a serious look at what
 
04:32:15.269 --> 04:32:15.279 align:start position:0%
we are asking of our small entrepreneurs
 
04:32:17.110 --> 04:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
and whether some of these rules even
 
04:32:19.030 --> 04:32:19.040 align:start position:0%
make any sense
 
04:32:21.110 --> 04:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
in any case something needs to be done
 
04:32:23.510 --> 04:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
and this issue needs to be addressed
 
04:32:26.710 --> 04:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
a small 10 by 18 foot shack should not
 
04:32:28.550 --> 04:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
have to install a grease trap that is
 
04:32:30.550 --> 04:32:30.560 align:start position:0%
almost as big as the shack from which
 
04:32:32.870 --> 04:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
they serve their customers
 
04:32:34.950 --> 04:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
and please know this is not just about
 
04:32:37.670 --> 04:32:37.680 align:start position:0%
balthazar's this is about overall
 
04:32:40.550 --> 04:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
inequity and illogical and inflexible
 
04:32:43.349 --> 04:32:43.359 align:start position:0%
rules that hurt small businesses across
 
04:32:45.590 --> 04:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
04:32:47.349 --> 04:32:47.359 align:start position:0%
there also seems to be an issue with
 
04:32:49.189 --> 04:32:49.199 align:start position:0%
other businesses being allowed to have
 
04:32:52.710 --> 04:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
an undersink grease trap and others not
 
04:32:55.189 --> 04:32:55.199 align:start position:0%
perhaps des inspectors are not being
 
04:32:58.469 --> 04:32:58.479 align:start position:0%
consistent with their rules
 
04:33:00.790 --> 04:33:00.800 align:start position:0%
even though some people might think this
 
04:33:02.790 --> 04:33:02.800 align:start position:0%
i sure hope that certain small
 
04:33:05.429 --> 04:33:05.439 align:start position:0%
businesses are not being targeted
 
04:33:07.349 --> 04:33:07.359 align:start position:0%
i also know some business owners and
 
04:33:09.269 --> 04:33:09.279 align:start position:0%
plumbing professionals that didn't wish
 
04:33:11.269 --> 04:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
to come and testify today because of
 
04:33:13.590 --> 04:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
fear of reprisals and i don't think
 
04:33:15.109 --> 04:33:15.119 align:start position:0%
that's a healthy environment for our
 
04:33:17.429 --> 04:33:17.439 align:start position:0%
small businesses either
 
04:33:19.109 --> 04:33:19.119 align:start position:0%
one last point
 
04:33:21.189 --> 04:33:21.199 align:start position:0%
i had written the commissioner of des on
 
04:33:24.709 --> 04:33:24.719 align:start position:0%
august 29 2021 requesting that their
 
04:33:26.629 --> 04:33:26.639 align:start position:0%
rules be changed to accommodate small
 
04:33:28.869 --> 04:33:28.879 align:start position:0%
businesses like balthazar's and to
 
04:33:31.750 --> 04:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
include flexibility for small businesses
 
04:33:34.470 --> 04:33:34.480 align:start position:0%
the response on october 8th was
 
04:33:36.310 --> 04:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
we'll look at it
 
04:33:38.150 --> 04:33:38.160 align:start position:0%
and that small businesses are already
 
04:33:40.629 --> 04:33:40.639 align:start position:0%
differentiated by allowing a minimum of
 
04:33:42.551 --> 04:33:42.561 align:start position:0%
a thousand gallon grease trap in this
 
04:33:42.561 --> 04:33:44.551 align:start position:0%
a thousand gallon grease trap in this
instance

04:33:44.551 --> 04:33:44.561 align:start position:0%
instance
 
04:33:46.230 --> 04:33:46.240 align:start position:0%
it's the end of january and they
 
04:33:48.551 --> 04:33:48.561 align:start position:0%
apparently are still looking at it in
 
04:33:50.470 --> 04:33:50.480 align:start position:0%
the meantime small businesses like
 
04:33:53.510 --> 04:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
balthazar's may must comply
 
04:33:57.189 --> 04:33:57.199 align:start position:0%
to costly and oversized rules
 
04:33:58.709 --> 04:33:58.719 align:start position:0%
so i hope you'll consider what i've
 
04:34:00.390 --> 04:34:00.400 align:start position:0%
presented today
 
04:34:01.990 --> 04:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
especially through the photos that i
 
04:34:03.670 --> 04:34:03.680 align:start position:0%
have sent around
 
04:34:05.109 --> 04:34:05.119 align:start position:0%
and listen to some of the people
 
04:34:07.189 --> 04:34:07.199 align:start position:0%
affected by these rules and what they
 
04:34:08.390 --> 04:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
have to say
 
04:34:10.150 --> 04:34:10.160 align:start position:0%
i'd like to see you pass this bill out
 
04:34:11.429 --> 04:34:11.439 align:start position:0%
of your committee
 
04:34:13.990 --> 04:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
it is time that we adopt the ipc as our
 
04:34:15.830 --> 04:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
own rules and help our small businesses
 
04:34:18.470 --> 04:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
be able to install systems that make
 
04:34:21.109 --> 04:34:21.119 align:start position:0%
sense to the type of operation that they
 
04:34:21.119 --> 04:34:22.629 align:start position:0%
sense to the type of operation that they
run

04:34:22.629 --> 04:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
run
 
04:34:23.670 --> 04:34:23.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:34:26.949 --> 04:34:26.959 align:start position:0%
and i'd be open to any questions
 
04:34:28.390 --> 04:34:28.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative aaron are there
 
04:34:32.070 --> 04:34:32.080 align:start position:0%
any questions from any of the members
 
04:34:34.390 --> 04:34:34.400 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
04:34:35.349 --> 04:34:35.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:34:38.390 --> 04:34:38.400 align:start position:0%
representative erin so your bill says
 
04:34:38.400 --> 04:34:39.590 align:start position:0%
representative erin so your bill says
that

04:34:39.590 --> 04:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:34:43.109 --> 04:34:43.119 align:start position:0%
you're asking that the specifications be

no more restrictive than the
 
04:34:47.990 --> 04:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
international plumbing code do you know
 
04:34:50.070 --> 04:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
what the international plumbing code
 
04:34:52.789 --> 04:34:52.799 align:start position:0%
would have said about this situation yes
 
04:34:55.029 --> 04:34:55.039 align:start position:0%
and i have a copy of it here and they
 
04:34:57.910 --> 04:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
have a chart that shows based on the
 
04:35:00.470 --> 04:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
total flow through the grease retention
 
04:35:00.480 --> 04:35:01.910 align:start position:0%

04:35:09.109 --> 04:35:09.119 align:start position:0%
systems
 
04:35:10.551 --> 04:35:10.561 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna
 
04:35:15.109 --> 04:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:18.551 --> 04:35:18.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:20.310 --> 04:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien i'm sorry i was
 
04:35:21.910 --> 04:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
thinking it was bailey that's that's
 
04:35:23.590 --> 04:35:23.600 align:start position:0%
quite all right uh thank you
 
04:35:25.990 --> 04:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
04:35:26.000 --> 04:35:27.189 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
um

04:35:27.189 --> 04:35:27.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:29.990 --> 04:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
it seems something happened here
 
04:35:30.000 --> 04:35:31.189 align:start position:0%
it seems something happened here
and

04:35:31.189 --> 04:35:31.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:35:33.590 --> 04:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
somebody made them put in a larger
 
04:35:35.670 --> 04:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
grease trap than was needed i think
 
04:35:35.680 --> 04:35:36.551 align:start position:0%
grease trap than was needed i think
that's

04:35:36.551 --> 04:35:36.561 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:35:39.429 --> 04:35:39.439 align:start position:0%
i cannot you know understand that
 
04:35:42.551 --> 04:35:42.561 align:start position:0%
but where was the negotiation with the
 
04:35:44.629 --> 04:35:44.639 align:start position:0%
you know the plumbing inspector or
 
04:35:47.109 --> 04:35:47.119 align:start position:0%
anything else like that if you say it
 
04:35:47.119 --> 04:35:48.150 align:start position:0%
anything else like that if you say it
exists

04:35:48.150 --> 04:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
exists
 
04:35:50.709 --> 04:35:50.719 align:start position:0%
in the plumbing code now why couldn't
 
04:35:52.789 --> 04:35:52.799 align:start position:0%
that you know particular business
 
04:35:55.750 --> 04:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
petition the plumbing inspector to try
 
04:35:55.760 --> 04:35:56.789 align:start position:0%
petition the plumbing inspector to try
to

04:35:56.789 --> 04:35:56.799 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:35:59.590 --> 04:35:59.600 align:start position:0%
uh make the amends it's you know because
 
04:36:02.390 --> 04:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
the thing is is this a state issue or a
 
04:36:04.709 --> 04:36:04.719 align:start position:0%
local issue that went awry
 
04:36:06.310 --> 04:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
i think thank you for your question
 
04:36:08.310 --> 04:36:08.320 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien i think this is a
 
04:36:11.510 --> 04:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
state issue because of the way the rules
 
04:36:11.520 --> 04:36:12.310 align:start position:0%
state issue because of the way the rules
are

04:36:12.310 --> 04:36:12.320 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:36:12.320 --> 04:36:13.349 align:start position:0%
are
for

04:36:13.349 --> 04:36:13.359 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:36:15.189 --> 04:36:15.199 align:start position:0%
des and licensing for these
 
04:36:15.199 --> 04:36:16.709 align:start position:0%
des and licensing for these
establishments

04:36:16.709 --> 04:36:16.719 align:start position:0%
establishments
 
04:36:19.109 --> 04:36:19.119 align:start position:0%
i would like you to ask that same
 
04:36:20.869 --> 04:36:20.879 align:start position:0%
question to the owners of balthazar's
 
04:36:22.949 --> 04:36:22.959 align:start position:0%
when they come up and they um
 
04:36:24.789 --> 04:36:24.799 align:start position:0%
and they testify
 
04:36:25.910 --> 04:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
because then
 
04:36:27.990 --> 04:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
you can ask them exactly who they spoke
 
04:36:30.390 --> 04:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
to and how they tried to rectify this
 
04:36:30.400 --> 04:36:31.670 align:start position:0%
to and how they tried to rectify this
situation

04:36:31.670 --> 04:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
situation
 
04:36:34.869 --> 04:36:34.879 align:start position:0%
but basically my understanding is that
 
04:36:37.349 --> 04:36:37.359 align:start position:0%
des came down they did an inspection
 
04:36:39.670 --> 04:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
they looked at the system they said we
 
04:36:41.429 --> 04:36:41.439 align:start position:0%
need you to put in a thousand gallon
 
04:36:42.789 --> 04:36:42.799 align:start position:0%
grease trap
 
04:36:45.109 --> 04:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
and they had to comply or have their
 
04:36:47.349 --> 04:36:47.359 align:start position:0%
license revoked
 
04:36:53.189 --> 04:36:53.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:54.789 --> 04:36:54.799 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions from any
 
04:36:57.269 --> 04:36:57.279 align:start position:0%
of the members
 
04:36:59.590 --> 04:36:59.600 align:start position:0%

i wish to reassure
 
04:37:27.990 --> 04:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien that the thousand
 
04:37:29.910 --> 04:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
gallon grease trap
 
04:37:33.349 --> 04:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
is specified in the des rules
 
04:37:33.359 --> 04:37:35.510 align:start position:0%
is specified in the des rules
for

04:37:35.510 --> 04:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:37:37.830 --> 04:37:37.840 align:start position:0%
restaurants attached to
 
04:37:40.629 --> 04:37:40.639 align:start position:0%
the restaurants that have sewer systems
 
04:37:42.789 --> 04:37:42.799 align:start position:0%
have septic tanks
 
04:37:44.709 --> 04:37:44.719 align:start position:0%
it's a thousand gallons regardless the
 
04:37:46.629 --> 04:37:46.639 align:start position:0%
size of the restaurant
 
04:37:46.639 --> 04:37:47.590 align:start position:0%
size of the restaurant
and

04:37:47.590 --> 04:37:47.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:37:49.750 --> 04:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
i happen to be part owner of a
 
04:37:51.990 --> 04:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
restaurant that has a
 
04:37:54.070 --> 04:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
septic system
 
04:37:56.629 --> 04:37:56.639 align:start position:0%
and i was talking with the
 
04:37:59.429 --> 04:37:59.439 align:start position:0%
with our co-owner and he says we have
 
04:38:03.670 --> 04:38:03.680 align:start position:0%
two 750 gallon tanks grease traps
 
04:38:03.680 --> 04:38:04.709 align:start position:0%
two 750 gallon tanks grease traps
because

04:38:04.709 --> 04:38:04.719 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:38:07.269 --> 04:38:07.279 align:start position:0%
it's a very expensive
 
04:38:10.470 --> 04:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
extra treatment septic system
 
04:38:12.470 --> 04:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
and they don't want it to get
 
04:38:14.869 --> 04:38:14.879 align:start position:0%
contaminated with grease
 
04:38:14.879 --> 04:38:15.670 align:start position:0%
contaminated with grease
but

04:38:15.670 --> 04:38:15.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:38:18.390 --> 04:38:18.400 align:start position:0%
the most important thing is
 
04:38:19.910 --> 04:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
the maintenance
 
04:38:22.709 --> 04:38:22.719 align:start position:0%
he pumps those tanks the grease traps
 
04:38:25.429 --> 04:38:25.439 align:start position:0%
twice as often as the
 
04:38:27.750 --> 04:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
manufacturer recommends to make sure
 
04:38:29.990 --> 04:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
they don't ever overflow
 
04:38:31.510 --> 04:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
and trash
 
04:38:35.189 --> 04:38:35.199 align:start position:0%
our quarter million dollar septic system
 
04:38:35.199 --> 04:38:36.470 align:start position:0%
our quarter million dollar septic system
that's

04:38:36.470 --> 04:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:38:36.480 --> 04:38:37.670 align:start position:0%
that's
it

04:38:37.670 --> 04:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:38:39.990 --> 04:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
and the that's the problem with the rule
 
04:38:42.390 --> 04:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
just saying a thousand gallons because
 
04:38:46.230 --> 04:38:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:47.990 --> 04:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
extra maintenance efforts it doesn't
 
04:38:50.470 --> 04:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
allow for very tiny restaurants it just
 
04:38:53.029 --> 04:38:53.039 align:start position:0%
says a thousand gallons period no
 
04:38:55.750 --> 04:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
waivers no exceptions no nothing
 
04:38:58.070 --> 04:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
and i think that kind of one size fits
 
04:38:59.349 --> 04:38:59.359 align:start position:0%
all rule
 
04:39:01.830 --> 04:39:01.840 align:start position:0%
is not appropriate for this sort of
 
04:39:04.869 --> 04:39:04.879 align:start position:0%
thing we have restaurants of widely
 
04:39:07.349 --> 04:39:07.359 align:start position:0%
varying size in the state
 
04:39:12.150 --> 04:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:14.310 --> 04:39:14.320 align:start position:0%
a homestead operation
 
04:39:16.709 --> 04:39:16.719 align:start position:0%
and putting this kind of
 
04:39:19.990 --> 04:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
rigid requirement by rule is
 
04:39:21.910 --> 04:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
inappropriate in my opinion so that's
 
04:39:24.070 --> 04:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
why i co-sponsored the spill
 
04:39:30.789 --> 04:39:30.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:31.910 --> 04:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for
 
04:39:35.429 --> 04:39:35.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:40.310 --> 04:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:53.430 --> 04:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:55.590 --> 04:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman and members um
 
04:39:56.948 --> 04:39:56.958 align:start position:0%
i'm not representing the board in this
 
04:39:59.750 --> 04:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
one i'm just representing denron hall
 
04:40:01.270 --> 04:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
i've come across these situations a lot
 
04:40:03.430 --> 04:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
where you have a small establishment and
 
04:40:06.230 --> 04:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
you have the two opposing forces the
 
04:40:08.788 --> 04:40:08.798 align:start position:0%
the plumbing code covering the structure
 
04:40:11.190 --> 04:40:11.200 align:start position:0%
and then the thousand gallon interceptor
 
04:40:13.350 --> 04:40:13.360 align:start position:0%
outside i personally had to deal with it
 
04:40:14.628 --> 04:40:14.638 align:start position:0%
with a
 
04:40:16.230 --> 04:40:16.240 align:start position:0%
in a different state but i've had to
 
04:40:18.628 --> 04:40:18.638 align:start position:0%
deal with it um with just a household
 
04:40:20.310 --> 04:40:20.320 align:start position:0%
kitchen but it was part of an assisted
 
04:40:21.670 --> 04:40:21.680 align:start position:0%
living where they bring food up and they
 
04:40:23.030 --> 04:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
were concerned and then once they saw it
 
04:40:23.040 --> 04:40:24.070 align:start position:0%
were concerned and then once they saw it
they

04:40:24.070 --> 04:40:24.080 align:start position:0%
they
 
04:40:25.750 --> 04:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
they did back off in the thousand gallon
 
04:40:27.750 --> 04:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
interceptor but i i fully believe in
 
04:40:30.230 --> 04:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
that it's not a one size fit all
 
04:40:33.350 --> 04:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
situation and that the plumbing code is
 
04:40:35.670 --> 04:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
it'll help size the situation
 
04:40:37.350 --> 04:40:37.360 align:start position:0%
it also does a better job of protecting
 
04:40:39.270 --> 04:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
the plumbing within the structure so if
 
04:40:41.030 --> 04:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
you're going to go with one the ipc is
 
04:40:42.868 --> 04:40:42.878 align:start position:0%
better for that so that way you start
 
04:40:44.868 --> 04:40:44.878 align:start position:0%
the protection right at the point of use
 
04:40:51.270 --> 04:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:53.030 --> 04:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien
 
04:40:55.190 --> 04:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
thank you manager i'm trying to wrap my
 
04:40:56.550 --> 04:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
head around
 
04:40:58.470 --> 04:40:58.480 align:start position:0%
this and maybe
 
04:41:00.550 --> 04:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
the thousand gallons when
 
04:41:03.350 --> 04:41:03.360 align:start position:0%
maybe like i say if it's in one code it
 
04:41:05.030 --> 04:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
could be smaller
 
04:41:06.948 --> 04:41:06.958 align:start position:0%
is it something to do like
 
04:41:08.868 --> 04:41:08.878 align:start position:0%
you know we were taught as firefighters
 
04:41:10.550 --> 04:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
it's occupancy
 
04:41:11.750 --> 04:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
is the key
 
04:41:13.910 --> 04:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
is that have anything to do with it in
 
04:41:16.150 --> 04:41:16.160 align:start position:0%
other words there's a fear in the future
 
04:41:18.270 --> 04:41:18.280 align:start position:0%
okay you could probably get by with the
 
04:41:21.750 --> 04:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
500 gallon grease wrap but that doesn't
 
04:41:23.270 --> 04:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
mean the next guy
 
04:41:25.110 --> 04:41:25.120 align:start position:0%
10 years from now
 
04:41:26.868 --> 04:41:26.878 align:start position:0%
you know because like in the case of the
 
04:41:29.270 --> 04:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
occupancy with the firefighting i could
 
04:41:31.910 --> 04:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
have a store that i sell brick out of
 
04:41:34.070 --> 04:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
but then i load it up with blankets i
 
04:41:36.788 --> 04:41:36.798 align:start position:0%
get a different fire hazard so
 
04:41:40.628 --> 04:41:40.638 align:start position:0%
the point i'm trying to make
 
04:41:42.470 --> 04:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
and you know i don't know the good cut
 
04:41:44.708 --> 04:41:44.718 align:start position:0%
off of it i think there is a nice gray
 
04:41:47.670 --> 04:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
area there as far as that occupancy is
 
04:41:50.550 --> 04:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
tough and change of use with uh business
 
04:41:51.830 --> 04:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
i think is what you're getting at like
 
04:41:51.840 --> 04:41:52.868 align:start position:0%
i think is what you're getting at like
um

04:41:52.868 --> 04:41:52.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:55.350 --> 04:41:55.360 align:start position:0%
like if you have uh
 
04:41:57.750 --> 04:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know like a pre-pre-packaged
 
04:41:59.750 --> 04:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
foods versi they throw an oven in now
 
04:42:01.670 --> 04:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
it's a bakery or something like that and
 
04:42:01.680 --> 04:42:02.868 align:start position:0%
it's a bakery or something like that and
um

04:42:02.868 --> 04:42:02.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:04.948 --> 04:42:04.958 align:start position:0%
i i don't know if there's something for
 
04:42:06.390 --> 04:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
that i do know i've come across those
 
04:42:07.830 --> 04:42:07.840 align:start position:0%
situations where you literally just have
 
04:42:10.550 --> 04:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
a kitchen sink a fridge and a microwave
 
04:42:10.560 --> 04:42:11.510 align:start position:0%
a kitchen sink a fridge and a microwave
and

04:42:11.510 --> 04:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:42:12.708 --> 04:42:12.718 align:start position:0%
they were going to make us put a
 
04:42:14.390 --> 04:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
thousand gallon interceptor in outside
 
04:42:16.470 --> 04:42:16.480 align:start position:0%
just because it happened to be part of
 
04:42:18.628 --> 04:42:18.638 align:start position:0%
an assisted living complex
 
04:42:20.070 --> 04:42:20.080 align:start position:0%
but luckily when they walked through
 
04:42:21.670 --> 04:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
they realized that it was smaller than
 
04:42:23.270 --> 04:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
their kitchen at their house and they're
 
04:42:24.470 --> 04:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
like they're just appointed to use
 
04:42:26.310 --> 04:42:26.320 align:start position:0%
grease interceptor then as far as actual
 
04:42:29.990 --> 04:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
laws and um coming up with a uh
 
04:42:31.590 --> 04:42:31.600 align:start position:0%
a compromise i'm not sure what that
 
04:42:33.670 --> 04:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
would be but as is right now i can
 
04:42:34.788 --> 04:42:34.798 align:start position:0%
totally understand where these people
 
04:42:36.788 --> 04:42:36.798 align:start position:0%
are coming from and if i'm to support
 
04:42:39.030 --> 04:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
something at least the ipc has you
 
04:42:41.590 --> 04:42:41.600 align:start position:0%
covered and they have a
 
04:42:43.430 --> 04:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
a varying degree of capacities instead
 
04:42:48.868 --> 04:42:48.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:52.310 --> 04:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:54.948 --> 04:42:54.958 align:start position:0%
mr nash what's a
 
04:42:58.150 --> 04:42:58.160 align:start position:0%
dentin hall what is that
 
04:43:00.150 --> 04:43:00.160 align:start position:0%
sorry that's me mumbling i'm with den
 
04:43:01.990 --> 04:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
ron hall
 
04:43:04.230 --> 04:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
we're out of manchester new hampshire
 
04:43:11.110 --> 04:43:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:12.708 --> 04:43:12.718 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
04:43:14.070 --> 04:43:14.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:43:17.190 --> 04:43:17.200 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering if if you need
 
04:43:20.070 --> 04:43:20.080 align:start position:0%
a grease trap for a restaurant a small
 
04:43:22.150 --> 04:43:22.160 align:start position:0%
restaurant and you know in this case
 
04:43:24.390 --> 04:43:24.400 align:start position:0%
maybe they don't need one but if you did
 
04:43:28.070 --> 04:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
what are the consequences of
 
04:43:32.470 --> 04:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
putting grease down the drain
 
04:43:32.480 --> 04:43:33.190 align:start position:0%
putting grease down the drain
and

04:43:33.190 --> 04:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:43:35.270 --> 04:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
like what's what what happens what's bad
 
04:43:38.470 --> 04:43:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:41.270 --> 04:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah roto-rooter um but the
 
04:43:42.948 --> 04:43:42.958 align:start position:0%
the reality of it is only as good as its
 
04:43:44.788 --> 04:43:44.798 align:start position:0%
maintenance to back to what i said
 
04:43:46.868 --> 04:43:46.878 align:start position:0%
before with anything you don't take care
 
04:43:48.550 --> 04:43:48.560 align:start position:0%
of the outside it's going to be bad for
 
04:43:49.910 --> 04:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
you you don't care if the inside grease
 
04:43:50.868 --> 04:43:50.878 align:start position:0%
interceptor is going to be bad for you
 
04:43:52.230 --> 04:43:52.240 align:start position:0%
so what you're trying to stop is the
 
04:43:54.390 --> 04:43:54.400 align:start position:0%
build up of excess grease in the pipes
 
04:43:56.150 --> 04:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
and the septic area i believe it's the
 
04:43:58.150 --> 04:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
leech fields getting all clogged up and
 
04:44:00.628 --> 04:44:00.638 align:start position:0%
not a good breakdown you can actually
 
04:44:02.708 --> 04:44:02.718 align:start position:0%
get the pipe it could start off this big
 
04:44:05.430 --> 04:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
and you end up with just a tiny hole and
 
04:44:07.830 --> 04:44:07.840 align:start position:0%
it's hard hard stuff that's built up
 
04:44:09.430 --> 04:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
inside of it if it's not maintained
 
04:44:09.440 --> 04:44:10.788 align:start position:0%
inside of it if it's not maintained
properly

04:44:10.788 --> 04:44:10.798 align:start position:0%
properly
 
04:44:11.910 --> 04:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
and you can get if you just have a
 
04:44:13.430 --> 04:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
thousand gallon and grease interceptor
 
04:44:15.030 --> 04:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
outside and you don't have the proper
 
04:44:17.190 --> 04:44:17.200 align:start position:0%
stuff inside then you can still have
 
04:44:19.830 --> 04:44:19.840 align:start position:0%
that issue with the inside structure
 
04:44:21.830 --> 04:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
that's why if you're going to have one
 
04:44:23.590 --> 04:44:23.600 align:start position:0%
for sure it's definitely the ipc to
 
04:44:26.948 --> 04:44:26.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:28.230 --> 04:44:28.240 align:start position:0%
um i don't know if i answered you
 
04:44:28.240 --> 04:44:30.070 align:start position:0%
um i don't know if i answered you
correctly

04:44:30.070 --> 04:44:30.080 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
04:44:30.080 --> 04:44:31.430 align:start position:0%
correctly
follow-up

04:44:31.430 --> 04:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:44:34.868 --> 04:44:34.878 align:start position:0%
yes so is it grease trap required for
 
04:44:38.868 --> 04:44:38.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:40.868 --> 04:44:40.878 align:start position:0%
no they're they're for
 
04:44:41.750 --> 04:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
04:44:43.350 --> 04:44:43.360 align:start position:0%
if you have a fry later and you have a
 
04:44:45.430 --> 04:44:45.440 align:start position:0%
lot of grease going into it i guess but
 
04:44:46.788 --> 04:44:46.798 align:start position:0%
it's really just for any situations
 
04:44:48.628 --> 04:44:48.638 align:start position:0%
where you have a lot of grease dairy
 
04:44:54.310 --> 04:44:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:55.670 --> 04:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions from any
 
04:44:55.680 --> 04:44:58.550 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions from any
members

04:44:58.550 --> 04:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:00.550 --> 04:45:00.560 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
04:45:03.910 --> 04:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:23.750 --> 04:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:25.430 --> 04:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
usually people don't want to hear me so
 
04:45:27.270 --> 04:45:27.280 align:start position:0%
i don't push that button
 
04:45:29.830 --> 04:45:29.840 align:start position:0%
so for the record rainey pelletier i'm
 
04:45:31.430 --> 04:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
the director of the water division at
 
04:45:31.440 --> 04:45:32.550 align:start position:0%
the director of the water division at
des

04:45:32.550 --> 04:45:32.560 align:start position:0%
des
 
04:45:34.230 --> 04:45:34.240 align:start position:0%
and i think the
 
04:45:36.230 --> 04:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
des personnel that representative aaron
 
04:45:38.550 --> 04:45:38.560 align:start position:0%
was talking about was probably myself
 
04:45:40.470 --> 04:45:40.480 align:start position:0%
and some staff
 
04:45:42.070 --> 04:45:42.080 align:start position:0%
so i think
 
04:45:44.390 --> 04:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
i'm going to try and add some clarity
 
04:45:44.400 --> 04:45:45.270 align:start position:0%
i'm going to try and add some clarity
here

04:45:45.270 --> 04:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:45:47.830 --> 04:45:47.840 align:start position:0%
the ipc climate plumbing code has
 
04:45:50.470 --> 04:45:50.480 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with on-site wastewater it
 
04:45:53.030 --> 04:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
looks about interior plumbing it tries
 
04:45:55.270 --> 04:45:55.280 align:start position:0%
to determine what you need to protect
 
04:45:58.070 --> 04:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
your interior plumbing as far as what
 
04:45:59.910 --> 04:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
goes into the ground on the wastewater
 
04:46:02.788 --> 04:46:02.798 align:start position:0%
side which is what we regulate
 
04:46:05.270 --> 04:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
ipc does not deal with that they can
 
04:46:07.750 --> 04:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
recommend certain size grease traps for
 
04:46:10.230 --> 04:46:10.240 align:start position:0%
the type of facility you have
 
04:46:12.868 --> 04:46:12.878 align:start position:0%
as mr nash i believe said to make sure
 
04:46:15.350 --> 04:46:15.360 align:start position:0%
your pipes don't clog and so forth but
 
04:46:18.708 --> 04:46:18.718 align:start position:0%
clearly ipc has absolutely nothing
 
04:46:21.510 --> 04:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
to do with on-site wastewater so i hope
 
04:46:24.230 --> 04:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
that that adds some clarity to that
 
04:46:25.910 --> 04:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
i think also i'm
 
04:46:29.590 --> 04:46:29.600 align:start position:0%
as far as i know i'm not sure that des
 
04:46:31.590 --> 04:46:31.600 align:start position:0%
was the individuals that went to the
 
04:46:34.628 --> 04:46:34.638 align:start position:0%
ballot says i'd be interested to hear
 
04:46:37.190 --> 04:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
who that personnel was but here's how
 
04:46:39.750 --> 04:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
the system on the statewide level works
 
04:46:41.670 --> 04:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
if someone is going to open a restaurant
 
04:46:43.990 --> 04:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
of any size type whether it be an ice
 
04:46:45.270 --> 04:46:45.280 align:start position:0%
cream stand
 
04:46:48.150 --> 04:46:48.160 align:start position:0%
or whether it be a restaurant to service
 
04:46:50.788 --> 04:46:50.798 align:start position:0%
fast food sandwiches
 
04:46:53.350 --> 04:46:53.360 align:start position:0%
has grease and so forth and so on they
 
04:46:57.350 --> 04:46:57.360 align:start position:0%
need to get a food license from hhns
 
04:47:00.150 --> 04:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
so once they get a food license every
 
04:47:02.070 --> 04:47:02.080 align:start position:0%
year they're reinspected to see what
 
04:47:04.470 --> 04:47:04.480 align:start position:0%
their premises are look at cleanliness
 
04:47:06.310 --> 04:47:06.320 align:start position:0%
and those types of things
 
04:47:09.430 --> 04:47:09.440 align:start position:0%
and also if there's been a change of use
 
04:47:13.030 --> 04:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
so if that happens they come to des
 
04:47:15.750 --> 04:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
there's some correspondence with them
 
04:47:17.990 --> 04:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
that asked if in fact their septic
 
04:47:20.550 --> 04:47:20.560 align:start position:0%
system was approved for the type of use
 
04:47:24.310 --> 04:47:24.320 align:start position:0%
that is being proposed or changed to
 
04:47:26.470 --> 04:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
i think what happened at this
 
04:47:28.470 --> 04:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
restaurant we're talking about now the
 
04:47:30.868 --> 04:47:30.878 align:start position:0%
one that representative aaron referenced
 
04:47:32.390 --> 04:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
was that they went out and did an
 
04:47:35.110 --> 04:47:35.120 align:start position:0%
inspection and it had been changed from
 
04:47:38.390 --> 04:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
an ice cream stand to serving food
 
04:47:40.628 --> 04:47:40.638 align:start position:0%
and more importantly food that in fact
 
04:47:43.430 --> 04:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
had prior layers in that type of issue
 
04:47:45.430 --> 04:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
so hence when that was brought to our
 
04:47:45.440 --> 04:47:46.708 align:start position:0%
so hence when that was brought to our
attention

04:47:46.708 --> 04:47:46.718 align:start position:0%
attention
 
04:47:48.788 --> 04:47:48.798 align:start position:0%
then as a minimum you're required to
 
04:47:50.310 --> 04:47:50.320 align:start position:0%
have a grease strap
 
04:47:53.030 --> 04:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
grease has a lot of
 
04:47:53.040 --> 04:47:54.550 align:start position:0%
grease has a lot of
terrible

04:47:54.550 --> 04:47:54.560 align:start position:0%
terrible
 
04:47:56.390 --> 04:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
attributes if you will for septic
 
04:47:56.400 --> 04:47:57.510 align:start position:0%
attributes if you will for septic
systems

04:47:57.510 --> 04:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
systems
 
04:47:59.910 --> 04:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
what we've seen lately in the last few
 
04:47:59.920 --> 04:48:01.030 align:start position:0%
what we've seen lately in the last few
years

04:48:01.030 --> 04:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:48:02.948 --> 04:48:02.958 align:start position:0%
and we're all for entrepreneurial
 
04:48:05.350 --> 04:48:05.360 align:start position:0%
businesses small businesses however big
 
04:48:07.350 --> 04:48:07.360 align:start position:0%
or small they would be
 
04:48:09.830 --> 04:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
but in some situations people will go in
 
04:48:11.590 --> 04:48:11.600 align:start position:0%
they'll lease a space
 
04:48:13.910 --> 04:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
un unknown to the
 
04:48:13.920 --> 04:48:15.190 align:start position:0%
un unknown to the
lessee

04:48:15.190 --> 04:48:15.200 align:start position:0%
lessee
 
04:48:17.030 --> 04:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
they could put in a russian put in
 
04:48:17.040 --> 04:48:17.990 align:start position:0%
they could put in a russian put in
greece

04:48:17.990 --> 04:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
greece
 
04:48:20.230 --> 04:48:20.240 align:start position:0%
if in fact their septic system fails
 
04:48:22.628 --> 04:48:22.638 align:start position:0%
depending on the size of that system it
 
04:48:25.430 --> 04:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
could cost the owner of that building
 
04:48:27.190 --> 04:48:27.200 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the twelve to fifteen
 
04:48:29.190 --> 04:48:29.200 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar price range
 
04:48:33.030 --> 04:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
grease is what we call fog fats oils and
 
04:48:33.040 --> 04:48:34.230 align:start position:0%
grease is what we call fog fats oils and
greases

04:48:34.230 --> 04:48:34.240 align:start position:0%
greases
 
04:48:36.150 --> 04:48:36.160 align:start position:0%
that's what comes out of a place that
 
04:48:38.708 --> 04:48:38.718 align:start position:0%
has a high grease load depending on the
 
04:48:40.550 --> 04:48:40.560 align:start position:0%
food that they're servicing
 
04:48:42.868 --> 04:48:42.878 align:start position:0%
so it's an important issue
 
04:48:45.430 --> 04:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
it's as much of an important issue for a
 
04:48:48.390 --> 04:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
person that owns a system that may go
 
04:48:50.230 --> 04:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
into failure especially if they're
 
04:48:53.430 --> 04:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
leasing the space to someone else
 
04:48:56.628 --> 04:48:56.638 align:start position:0%
or to anyone else the system clogs
 
04:48:58.788 --> 04:48:58.798 align:start position:0%
and if it's a large commercial system
 
04:49:01.030 --> 04:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
like representative mcguire was talking
 
04:49:03.510 --> 04:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
about you could be looking at 30 40 50
 
04:49:03.520 --> 04:49:04.470 align:start position:0%
about you could be looking at 30 40 50
000.

04:49:04.470 --> 04:49:04.480 align:start position:0%
000.
 
04:49:07.030 --> 04:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
now the shack we're talking about not
 
04:49:10.070 --> 04:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
that order of magnitude mind you
 
04:49:12.310 --> 04:49:12.320 align:start position:0%
but in fact it is an issue
 
04:49:14.628 --> 04:49:14.638 align:start position:0%
we have dealt with oils fats oils and
 
04:49:16.788 --> 04:49:16.798 align:start position:0%
greases for years we do it on the waste
 
04:49:18.868 --> 04:49:18.878 align:start position:0%
water collection side
 
04:49:20.868 --> 04:49:20.878 align:start position:0%
if it's a municipal wastewater treatment
 
04:49:22.628 --> 04:49:22.638 align:start position:0%
plant it's important about how that
 
04:49:24.310 --> 04:49:24.320 align:start position:0%
waste is processed
 
04:49:26.708 --> 04:49:26.718 align:start position:0%
and more importantly it's it's just as
 
04:49:29.590 --> 04:49:29.600 align:start position:0%
in a financial issue for the person that
 
04:49:31.670 --> 04:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
owns the building or the septic system
 
04:49:33.190 --> 04:49:33.200 align:start position:0%
that it's in so
 
04:49:35.190 --> 04:49:35.200 align:start position:0%
if i might madam chair i'd like to bring
 
04:49:37.830 --> 04:49:37.840 align:start position:0%
up ray gordon news with me he's been
 
04:49:39.990 --> 04:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
dealing with fog
 
04:49:42.070 --> 04:49:42.080 align:start position:0%
if you will for years
 
04:49:44.230 --> 04:49:44.240 align:start position:0%
and i think maybe if you can give us
 
04:49:47.350 --> 04:49:47.360 align:start position:0%
five or six minutes to give you a little
 
04:49:47.360 --> 04:49:48.470 align:start position:0%
five or six minutes to give you a little
primer

04:49:48.470 --> 04:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
primer
 
04:49:48.480 --> 04:49:49.670 align:start position:0%
primer
on

04:49:49.670 --> 04:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:49:51.830 --> 04:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
the disadvantages if you don't properly
 
04:49:51.840 --> 04:49:52.868 align:start position:0%
the disadvantages if you don't properly
maintain

04:49:52.868 --> 04:49:52.878 align:start position:0%
maintain
 
04:49:54.868 --> 04:49:54.878 align:start position:0%
fats oils and greases if that would be
 
04:49:57.270 --> 04:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
okay with you
 
04:49:57.280 --> 04:50:04.070 align:start position:0%
okay with you
absolutely

04:50:04.070 --> 04:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:05.910 --> 04:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:50:07.510 --> 04:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
so my name is ray gordon i've worked for
 
04:50:09.030 --> 04:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
the department of environmental services
 
04:50:15.990 --> 04:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:17.670 --> 04:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
and for two years i've been at the
 
04:50:19.590 --> 04:50:19.600 align:start position:0%
winnipesaukee river basin program
 
04:50:21.350 --> 04:50:21.360 align:start position:0%
running the state-owned wastewater
 
04:50:22.868 --> 04:50:22.878 align:start position:0%
treatment facility
 
04:50:22.878 --> 04:50:24.070 align:start position:0%
treatment facility
and

04:50:24.070 --> 04:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:50:25.750 --> 04:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
uh for 14 years i worked for the
 
04:50:29.510 --> 04:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:32.788 --> 04:50:32.798 align:start position:0%
and it all started with the um
 
04:50:34.788 --> 04:50:34.798 align:start position:0%
commission to study ways to encourage
 
04:50:36.708 --> 04:50:36.718 align:start position:0%
proper recycling
 
04:50:39.670 --> 04:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
and disposal of grease trap waste back
 
04:50:41.350 --> 04:50:41.360 align:start position:0%
in 2007
 
04:50:43.430 --> 04:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
and i learned a lot on that legislative
 
04:50:55.430 --> 04:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:00.868 --> 04:51:00.878 align:start position:0%
so as a result of that the state was um
 
04:51:03.670 --> 04:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
given the task of educating everybody on
 
04:51:06.550 --> 04:51:06.560 align:start position:0%
grease trap issues and i created a
 
04:51:09.430 --> 04:51:09.440 align:start position:0%
six-hour training program for wastewater
 
04:51:11.350 --> 04:51:11.360 align:start position:0%
operators and wastewater systems on
 
04:51:13.510 --> 04:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
grease interceptors and as well as a
 
04:51:16.230 --> 04:51:16.240 align:start position:0%
three-hour class for subsurface and i've
 
04:51:17.910 --> 04:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
certainly stayed on top of the topics
 
04:51:19.510 --> 04:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
over those years
 
04:51:21.750 --> 04:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
and the international plumbing code what
 
04:51:24.708 --> 04:51:24.718 align:start position:0%
we find just has minimum standards so
 
04:51:26.470 --> 04:51:26.480 align:start position:0%
it's a matter of how much water is
 
04:51:29.510 --> 04:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
flowing and what's the minimum size
 
04:51:33.750 --> 04:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
grease interceptor that you need
 
04:51:36.150 --> 04:51:36.160 align:start position:0%
in order to primarily protect the
 
04:51:37.670 --> 04:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
plumbing of the building and some states
 
04:51:39.750 --> 04:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
like massachusetts have actually
 
04:51:42.230 --> 04:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
mandated internal in some communities an
 
04:51:44.150 --> 04:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
internal grease interceptor to protect
 
04:51:46.390 --> 04:51:46.400 align:start position:0%
the plumbing and an external one to
 
04:51:47.670 --> 04:51:47.680 align:start position:0%
protect the
 
04:51:50.150 --> 04:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
uh wastewater collection system whether
 
04:51:52.150 --> 04:51:52.160 align:start position:0%
it be a wastewater
 
04:51:54.868 --> 04:51:54.878 align:start position:0%
sewer plant like i run or a
 
04:51:57.990 --> 04:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:58.000 --> 04:51:59.270 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:51:59.270 --> 04:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:52:02.150 --> 04:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
the biggest thing is you got two size
 
04:52:04.390 --> 04:52:04.400 align:start position:0%
interceptors a small one that has a 30
 
04:52:07.190 --> 04:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
minute retention time a large one
 
04:52:10.070 --> 04:52:10.080 align:start position:0%
that could have a 36 hour retention time
 
04:52:11.990 --> 04:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
and each one of them has its pros and
 
04:52:12.000 --> 04:52:13.110 align:start position:0%
and each one of them has its pros and
cons

04:52:13.110 --> 04:52:13.120 align:start position:0%
cons
 
04:52:15.270 --> 04:52:15.280 align:start position:0%
and from the wastewater side we're
 
04:52:16.628 --> 04:52:16.638 align:start position:0%
always balancing that with the
 
04:52:18.948 --> 04:52:18.958 align:start position:0%
restaurants around the state and we have
 
04:52:21.750 --> 04:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
a mix of the small devices and the large
 
04:52:24.470 --> 04:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
devices on our sewer systems all through
 
04:52:25.590 --> 04:52:25.600 align:start position:0%
the state
 
04:52:27.750 --> 04:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
but because it is so much more important
 
04:52:30.150 --> 04:52:30.160 align:start position:0%
on the septic system side the department
 
04:52:32.070 --> 04:52:32.080 align:start position:0%
over the years went with the thousand
 
04:52:33.590 --> 04:52:33.600 align:start position:0%
gallon tank
 
04:52:34.788 --> 04:52:34.798 align:start position:0%
and the
 
04:52:36.628 --> 04:52:36.638 align:start position:0%
issue with it is
 
04:52:39.110 --> 04:52:39.120 align:start position:0%
is it's all about the grease that needs
 
04:52:41.030 --> 04:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
to be disposed of
 
04:52:44.310 --> 04:52:44.320 align:start position:0%
and it's basically a storage vessel
 
04:52:46.470 --> 04:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
for the grease to be removed and there
 
04:52:49.510 --> 04:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
are very limited areas which is why we
 
04:52:51.430 --> 04:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
limited areas for disposal which is why
 
04:52:53.110 --> 04:52:53.120 align:start position:0%
we did the study commission to try to
 
04:52:56.230 --> 04:52:56.240 align:start position:0%
encourage more disposal of this grease
 
04:52:57.270 --> 04:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
because there's two things that are
 
04:53:00.310 --> 04:53:00.320 align:start position:0%
going to happen with this
 
04:53:02.788 --> 04:53:02.798 align:start position:0%
first off the waste systems can be
 
04:53:05.350 --> 04:53:05.360 align:start position:0%
damaged if you're not storing the grease
 
04:53:07.430 --> 04:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
and removing the grease from that
 
04:53:10.948 --> 04:53:10.958 align:start position:0%
interceptor on a frequent enough basis
 
04:53:13.510 --> 04:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
and then on the other end if the grease
 
04:53:15.270 --> 04:53:15.280 align:start position:0%
is passing through into the septic
 
04:53:15.280 --> 04:53:16.390 align:start position:0%
is passing through into the septic
system

04:53:16.390 --> 04:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
system
 
04:53:18.868 --> 04:53:18.878 align:start position:0%
then that septic tank when it's pumped
 
04:53:20.788 --> 04:53:20.798 align:start position:0%
could be rejected from
 
04:53:23.190 --> 04:53:23.200 align:start position:0%
a wastewater treatment plant
 
04:53:25.030 --> 04:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
and that contaminated load would have to
 
04:53:27.110 --> 04:53:27.120 align:start position:0%
find somewhere else to go i only know
 
04:53:29.030 --> 04:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
one facility down in rain and mass that
 
04:53:32.310 --> 04:53:32.320 align:start position:0%
like septage and greece together
 
04:53:35.110 --> 04:53:35.120 align:start position:0%
right now we have facility in allenstown
 
04:53:37.830 --> 04:53:37.840 align:start position:0%
that takes greece south berwick maine
 
04:53:39.910 --> 04:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
but there's really limited disposal for
 
04:53:42.868 --> 04:53:42.878 align:start position:0%
the greece from the greece interceptors
 
04:53:44.550 --> 04:53:44.560 align:start position:0%
now i've gone out inspecting greece
 
04:53:46.470 --> 04:53:46.480 align:start position:0%
interceptors with many towns around the
 
04:53:48.550 --> 04:53:48.560 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
04:53:50.628 --> 04:53:50.638 align:start position:0%
and what we see on the small devices for
 
04:53:50.638 --> 04:53:52.070 align:start position:0%
and what we see on the small devices for
disposal

04:53:52.070 --> 04:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
disposal
 
04:53:54.628 --> 04:53:54.638 align:start position:0%
is sometimes their yellow grease
 
04:53:56.708 --> 04:53:56.718 align:start position:0%
containers which is that fry grease it
 
04:53:59.910 --> 04:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
never comes in contact with waste water
 
04:54:01.910 --> 04:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
it gets put out back and it gets sent
 
04:54:03.830 --> 04:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
off for recycling
 
04:54:05.990 --> 04:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
and they can put some of that grease
 
04:54:07.830 --> 04:54:07.840 align:start position:0%
from that grease interceptor in there as
 
04:54:09.350 --> 04:54:09.360 align:start position:0%
long as they're not contaminating it
 
04:54:11.270 --> 04:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
enough the renderer allows them to do
 
04:54:11.280 --> 04:54:12.150 align:start position:0%
enough the renderer allows them to do
that

04:54:12.150 --> 04:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:54:13.750 --> 04:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
other folks maybe are throwing that
 
04:54:16.070 --> 04:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
grease in a dumpster
 
04:54:18.948 --> 04:54:18.958 align:start position:0%
and you know that's kind of frowned upon
 
04:54:21.030 --> 04:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
because it could leak and cause problems
 
04:54:23.110 --> 04:54:23.120 align:start position:0%
but it does happen
 
04:54:25.110 --> 04:54:25.120 align:start position:0%
but really the best option is to take
 
04:54:27.030 --> 04:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
that grease and send it off for proper
 
04:54:27.040 --> 04:54:28.390 align:start position:0%
that grease and send it off for proper
disposal

04:54:28.390 --> 04:54:28.400 align:start position:0%
disposal
 
04:54:30.150 --> 04:54:30.160 align:start position:0%
to a disposal location and that's
 
04:54:32.868 --> 04:54:32.878 align:start position:0%
typically done by a septic hauler with a
 
04:54:34.550 --> 04:54:34.560 align:start position:0%
large truck
 
04:54:37.190 --> 04:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
and you know it's way more economical to
 
04:54:39.110 --> 04:54:39.120 align:start position:0%
store the grease in a thousand gallon
 
04:54:41.590 --> 04:54:41.600 align:start position:0%
tank and have a truck haul a thousand
 
04:54:43.750 --> 04:54:43.760 align:start position:0%
gallons at a time maybe every three
 
04:54:45.670 --> 04:54:45.680 align:start position:0%
months every six months
 
04:54:47.910 --> 04:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
than it is to do the proper maintenance
 
04:54:49.270 --> 04:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
on the small
 
04:54:51.590 --> 04:54:51.600 align:start position:0%
grease interceptors which the story i
 
04:54:53.190 --> 04:54:53.200 align:start position:0%
was told the training was that they were
 
04:54:55.190 --> 04:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
developed by the military to be emptied
 
04:54:56.550 --> 04:54:56.560 align:start position:0%
every day
 
04:54:58.708 --> 04:54:58.718 align:start position:0%
and that's a lot of labor and time to
 
04:55:00.310 --> 04:55:00.320 align:start position:0%
empty them every day to make sure you're
 
04:55:04.390 --> 04:55:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:06.070 --> 04:55:06.080 align:start position:0%
and then where's the grease going to go
 
04:55:07.590 --> 04:55:07.600 align:start position:0%
when you empty it you need some other
 
04:55:10.070 --> 04:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
tank to store it in to have someone come
 
04:55:12.948 --> 04:55:12.958 align:start position:0%
and and haul it away
 
04:55:15.510 --> 04:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
so that's just a brief summary of the
 
04:55:17.670 --> 04:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
grease interceptors
 
04:55:19.670 --> 04:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
and what we see i'd be happy to answer
 
04:55:22.788 --> 04:55:22.798 align:start position:0%
more questions about it
 
04:55:24.550 --> 04:55:24.560 align:start position:0%
representative schuett
 
04:55:27.190 --> 04:55:27.200 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair yes um
 
04:55:30.628 --> 04:55:30.638 align:start position:0%
representative aaron's bill uh refers to
 
04:55:33.830 --> 04:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
the international plumbing code
 
04:55:35.430 --> 04:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
that the
 
04:55:39.430 --> 04:55:39.440 align:start position:0%
components shall be no more restrictive
 
04:55:41.350 --> 04:55:41.360 align:start position:0%
than the ipc
 
04:55:44.230 --> 04:55:44.240 align:start position:0%
however i thought i heard you say
 
04:55:48.788 --> 04:55:48.798 align:start position:0%
that the ipc codes are a minimum
 
04:55:50.948 --> 04:55:50.958 align:start position:0%
which she is referring to i would say
 
04:55:53.350 --> 04:55:53.360 align:start position:0%
would be a maximum level
 
04:55:53.360 --> 04:55:54.708 align:start position:0%
would be a maximum level
um

04:55:54.708 --> 04:55:54.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:55:56.230 --> 04:55:56.240 align:start position:0%
which is what
 
04:55:58.150 --> 04:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
yeah so the international plumbing code
 
04:55:59.750 --> 04:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
there's a chart in it it says you've got
 
04:56:02.070 --> 04:56:02.080 align:start position:0%
15 pounds i mean
 
04:56:04.150 --> 04:56:04.160 align:start position:0%
15 gallons per minute coming out of the
 
04:56:06.868 --> 04:56:06.878 align:start position:0%
sink so that's the flow rate
 
04:56:06.878 --> 04:56:07.670 align:start position:0%
sink so that's the flow rate
then

04:56:07.670 --> 04:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
then
 
04:56:10.390 --> 04:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
you have to have 30 pounds of storage
 
04:56:11.510 --> 04:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
for grease
 
04:56:13.670 --> 04:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
so you only are able to store 30 pounds
 
04:56:15.590 --> 04:56:15.600 align:start position:0%
of grease at a time with a faucet that
 
04:56:19.190 --> 04:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
gives you that much of a flow
 
04:56:21.190 --> 04:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
and a lot of the manufacturers of grease
 
04:56:23.190 --> 04:56:23.200 align:start position:0%
interceptors are giving you more
 
04:56:25.110 --> 04:56:25.120 align:start position:0%
capacity in their grease interceptors
 
04:56:27.030 --> 04:56:27.040 align:start position:0%
when you look at the rating there's a
 
04:56:29.350 --> 04:56:29.360 align:start position:0%
there's a chart that they give you
 
04:56:30.708 --> 04:56:30.718 align:start position:0%
because they know it's all about the
 
04:56:32.230 --> 04:56:32.240 align:start position:0%
grease storage
 
04:56:34.550 --> 04:56:34.560 align:start position:0%
and the way i understand the code that's
 
04:56:37.750 --> 04:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
the minimum and then many towns around
 
04:56:38.868 --> 04:56:38.878 align:start position:0%
the state
 
04:56:38.878 --> 04:56:40.070 align:start position:0%
the state
have

04:56:40.070 --> 04:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:56:42.070 --> 04:56:42.080 align:start position:0%
sewer use ordinances
 
04:56:42.080 --> 04:56:43.030 align:start position:0%
sewer use ordinances
which

04:56:43.030 --> 04:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
which
 
04:56:44.628 --> 04:56:44.638 align:start position:0%
can be more restrictive than the
 
04:56:46.550 --> 04:56:46.560 align:start position:0%
plumbing code
 
04:56:48.788 --> 04:56:48.798 align:start position:0%
and some of them will add in thousand
 
04:56:50.868 --> 04:56:50.878 align:start position:0%
gallon tanks or there's even automatic
 
04:56:53.350 --> 04:56:53.360 align:start position:0%
devices that will remove the grease
 
04:56:55.590 --> 04:56:55.600 align:start position:0%
on an ongoing basis so you don't have to
 
04:56:55.600 --> 04:56:56.470 align:start position:0%
on an ongoing basis so you don't have to
hand

04:56:56.470 --> 04:56:56.480 align:start position:0%
hand
 
04:57:00.628 --> 04:57:00.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:03.030 --> 04:57:03.040 align:start position:0%
representative allegro
 
04:57:04.948 --> 04:57:04.958 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
04:57:07.830 --> 04:57:07.840 align:start position:0%
i'm a little bit confused here because
 
04:57:10.788 --> 04:57:10.798 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day all code
 
04:57:13.190 --> 04:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
you should never say all or always but
 
04:57:15.750 --> 04:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
essentially all code is about minima not
 
04:57:17.350 --> 04:57:17.360 align:start position:0%
about maxima
 
04:57:17.360 --> 04:57:19.190 align:start position:0%
about maxima
so

04:57:19.190 --> 04:57:19.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:57:20.788 --> 04:57:20.798 align:start position:0%
like for instance
 
04:57:23.670 --> 04:57:23.680 align:start position:0%
we built a house the code said that a uh
 
04:57:25.910 --> 04:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
electrical sockets had to be
 
04:57:28.868 --> 04:57:28.878 align:start position:0%
at least one every six feet
 
04:57:31.750 --> 04:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
the code didn't state anything about
 
04:57:34.550 --> 04:57:34.560 align:start position:0%
forcing us to have four every six feet
 
04:57:37.190 --> 04:57:37.200 align:start position:0%
so code is about minima so i'm not sure
 
04:57:38.550 --> 04:57:38.560 align:start position:0%
i understand
 
04:57:40.230 --> 04:57:40.240 align:start position:0%
your argument here
 
04:57:41.750 --> 04:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
right and that's where i'd refer to the
 
04:57:43.430 --> 04:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
others in the department because on the
 
04:57:45.910 --> 04:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
wastewater side we have a collection of
 
04:57:47.270 --> 04:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
both larger
 
04:57:49.670 --> 04:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
thousand gallon interceptors and you
 
04:57:51.750 --> 04:57:51.760 align:start position:0%
know the smaller under the sink ones in
 
04:57:55.510 --> 04:57:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:55.520 --> 04:57:57.270 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

04:57:57.270 --> 04:57:57.280 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:57:59.590 --> 04:57:59.600 align:start position:0%
but those are each for different
 
04:58:01.350 --> 04:58:01.360 align:start position:0%
circumstances right
 
04:58:02.470 --> 04:58:02.480 align:start position:0%
it's not that they're saying you could
 
04:58:02.480 --> 04:58:03.670 align:start position:0%
it's not that they're saying you could
have

04:58:03.670 --> 04:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:58:05.350 --> 04:58:05.360 align:start position:0%
excuse my ignorance of the terminology
 
04:58:08.150 --> 04:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
but one thousand or two thousand for a
 
04:58:09.910 --> 04:58:09.920 align:start position:0%
situation it's that you have one
 
04:58:12.070 --> 04:58:12.080 align:start position:0%
thousand for this situation and two
 
04:58:16.070 --> 04:58:16.080 align:start position:0%
thousand for that situation so at least
 
04:58:18.708 --> 04:58:18.718 align:start position:0%
and by definition at least
 
04:58:20.070 --> 04:58:20.080 align:start position:0%
means a minimum
 
04:58:22.390 --> 04:58:22.400 align:start position:0%
so the ipc codes of course naturally are
 
04:58:26.550 --> 04:58:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:27.670 --> 04:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
for me
 
04:58:30.868 --> 04:58:30.878 align:start position:0%
yeah i think i want to get us off this
 
04:58:33.190 --> 04:58:33.200 align:start position:0%
concept of the ip soda and on-site
 
04:58:35.750 --> 04:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
wastewater they are totally irrelevant
 
04:58:37.190 --> 04:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
to each other
 
04:58:39.910 --> 04:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
it is a concern to us if the plumbing
 
04:58:42.150 --> 04:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
code has an issue and people's pipes
 
04:58:44.550 --> 04:58:44.560 align:start position:0%
clogged so forth and so on
 
04:58:47.750 --> 04:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
what we regulated des is what comes out
 
04:58:49.510 --> 04:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
of that structure
 
04:58:52.150 --> 04:58:52.160 align:start position:0%
and goes into a septic tank or an
 
04:58:55.030 --> 04:58:55.040 align:start position:0%
increase in separate if you will or not
 
04:58:57.510 --> 04:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
and now a minimum of a thousand gallons
 
04:59:00.070 --> 04:59:00.080 align:start position:0%
tanks is correct that's a minimum if
 
04:59:01.670 --> 04:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
you've got a hundred seat restroom
 
04:59:02.868 --> 04:59:02.878 align:start position:0%
you're going to have a much larger
 
04:59:04.628 --> 04:59:04.638 align:start position:0%
grease trap and i think representative
 
04:59:06.230 --> 04:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
mcguire mentioned
 
04:59:08.708 --> 04:59:08.718 align:start position:0%
that they had twin 750s
 
04:59:11.270 --> 04:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
and that's because on a
 
04:59:14.310 --> 04:59:14.320 align:start position:0%
flow basis as ray described to
 
04:59:14.320 --> 04:59:15.590 align:start position:0%
flow basis as ray described to
representative

04:59:15.590 --> 04:59:15.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:59:17.910 --> 04:59:17.920 align:start position:0%
anything of 15 gallons a minute or more
 
04:59:20.788 --> 04:59:20.798 align:start position:0%
you need this size grease trap again the
 
04:59:24.550 --> 04:59:24.560 align:start position:0%
ipc code is addressing the interior
 
04:59:24.560 --> 04:59:26.070 align:start position:0%
ipc code is addressing the interior
plumbing

04:59:26.070 --> 04:59:26.080 align:start position:0%
plumbing
 
04:59:28.230 --> 04:59:28.240 align:start position:0%
not the waste water issues that in fact
 
04:59:30.150 --> 04:59:30.160 align:start position:0%
is what we regulate
 
04:59:32.628 --> 04:59:32.638 align:start position:0%
so you do have minimums for grease traps
 
04:59:34.310 --> 04:59:34.320 align:start position:0%
for sure
 
04:59:37.430 --> 04:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
but you also have numbers as the flows
 
04:59:39.110 --> 04:59:39.120 align:start position:0%
increase all of what we do in the
 
04:59:41.830 --> 04:59:41.840 align:start position:0%
wastewater world is based on flow or
 
04:59:44.070 --> 04:59:44.080 align:start position:0%
discharge if you will you know from a
 
04:59:46.070 --> 04:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
single family home that you were talking
 
04:59:49.350 --> 04:59:49.360 align:start position:0%
about you we have design flows
 
04:59:50.708 --> 04:59:50.718 align:start position:0%
that are
 
04:59:53.270 --> 04:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
conservative standards for 150 gallons
 
04:59:55.110 --> 04:59:55.120 align:start position:0%
of bedroom per day that's what's
 
04:59:56.788 --> 04:59:56.798 align:start position:0%
designed we don't need to tell you you
 
04:59:58.948 --> 04:59:58.958 align:start position:0%
need 200 gallons per day
 
05:00:01.190 --> 05:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
because we figure your average flows are
 
05:00:04.470 --> 05:00:04.480 align:start position:0%
going to be probably less than 150 and
 
05:00:07.110 --> 05:00:07.120 align:start position:0%
that's very similar to when the ipc
 
05:00:08.948 --> 05:00:08.958 align:start position:0%
looks at grease traps
 
05:00:11.830 --> 05:00:11.840 align:start position:0%
they look at the size of the of the type
 
05:00:13.510 --> 05:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
of business what they're going to be
 
05:00:16.230 --> 05:00:16.240 align:start position:0%
discharging how many gallons per minute
 
05:00:18.390 --> 05:00:18.400 align:start position:0%
would go and they recommend sizes for
 
05:00:21.110 --> 05:00:21.120 align:start position:0%
interior grease traps that's where this
 
05:00:23.270 --> 05:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
issue of minimum came
 
05:00:25.190 --> 05:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
let's say that you were lucky and you
 
05:00:28.310 --> 05:00:28.320 align:start position:0%
had a bedrock welded and you could push
 
05:00:30.628 --> 05:00:30.638 align:start position:0%
30 gallons a minute out that grease
 
05:00:32.868 --> 05:00:32.878 align:start position:0%
strap in size would no longer be at that
 
05:00:36.070 --> 05:00:36.080 align:start position:0%
minimum and that's how the ipc regulates
 
05:00:38.310 --> 05:00:38.320 align:start position:0%
that totally different from the way we
 
05:00:40.390 --> 05:00:40.400 align:start position:0%
calculate flows that come out of a
 
05:00:44.390 --> 05:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:48.628 --> 05:00:48.638 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt then grota
 
05:00:50.708 --> 05:00:50.718 align:start position:0%
thank you mama chair
 
05:00:53.270 --> 05:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
so 16 years ago when i was on the
 
05:00:57.510 --> 05:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:00.830 --> 05:01:00.840 align:start position:0%
i inherited a study committee
 
05:01:03.590 --> 05:01:03.600 align:start position:0%
from a
 
05:01:06.868 --> 05:01:06.878 align:start position:0%
very nice colleague in my committee who
 
05:01:09.030 --> 05:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
didn't run again the next time and what
 
05:01:11.750 --> 05:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
it was called the fog committee
 
05:01:14.150 --> 05:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
fat oil in greece
 
05:01:17.030 --> 05:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
rainey remembers that
 
05:01:17.040 --> 05:01:18.470 align:start position:0%
rainey remembers that
so

05:01:18.470 --> 05:01:18.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:01:20.070 --> 05:01:20.080 align:start position:0%
one of the things that was the period
 
05:01:22.550 --> 05:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
where yellow grease was going from
 
05:01:25.030 --> 05:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
costing the restaurants to have it
 
05:01:26.390 --> 05:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
hauled away
 
05:01:28.550 --> 05:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
to getting paid for the yellow grease
 
05:01:31.910 --> 05:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:34.628 --> 05:01:34.638 align:start position:0%
recycle it
 
05:01:37.190 --> 05:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
the nasty stuff
 
05:01:40.470 --> 05:01:40.480 align:start position:0%
that brown grease
 
05:01:43.110 --> 05:01:43.120 align:start position:0%
restaurants produced was still costing
 
05:01:43.120 --> 05:01:43.910 align:start position:0%
restaurants produced was still costing
an

05:01:43.910 --> 05:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
an
 
05:01:45.670 --> 05:01:45.680 align:start position:0%
arm and a leg because
 
05:01:47.190 --> 05:01:47.200 align:start position:0%
it's you know
 
05:01:50.310 --> 05:01:50.320 align:start position:0%
couldn't be used for anything and it was
 
05:01:50.320 --> 05:01:52.230 align:start position:0%
couldn't be used for anything and it was
um

05:01:52.230 --> 05:01:52.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:01:54.708 --> 05:01:54.718 align:start position:0%
really really disgusting stuff
 
05:01:56.868 --> 05:01:56.878 align:start position:0%
really i had a whiff of one of them one
 
05:01:58.628 --> 05:01:58.638 align:start position:0%
time and i'm going like that'll do it
 
05:02:01.030 --> 05:02:01.040 align:start position:0%
for me for the rest of my life
 
05:02:02.708 --> 05:02:02.718 align:start position:0%
and these people have to deal with those
 
05:02:04.550 --> 05:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
dang things
 
05:02:06.390 --> 05:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
every day because that's what they're
 
05:02:06.400 --> 05:02:07.830 align:start position:0%
every day because that's what they're
producing

05:02:07.830 --> 05:02:07.840 align:start position:0%
producing
 
05:02:10.070 --> 05:02:10.080 align:start position:0%
and we look for the possibility because
 
05:02:11.350 --> 05:02:11.360 align:start position:0%
brown grease
 
05:02:13.190 --> 05:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
does have
 
05:02:13.200 --> 05:02:14.070 align:start position:0%
does have
some

05:02:14.070 --> 05:02:14.080 align:start position:0%
some
 
05:02:16.070 --> 05:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
energy potential if you could if you
 
05:02:17.830 --> 05:02:17.840 align:start position:0%
could get it representative schmidt
 
05:02:20.230 --> 05:02:20.240 align:start position:0%
could you please ask the question
 
05:02:22.628 --> 05:02:22.638 align:start position:0%
so i have to give a little bit of
 
05:02:25.430 --> 05:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
background so i understand so
 
05:02:29.350 --> 05:02:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:33.430 --> 05:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
uh a device a procedure that was able to
 
05:02:37.190 --> 05:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
turn brown grease into usable form
 
05:02:40.230 --> 05:02:40.240 align:start position:0%
but my understanding is that it actually
 
05:02:42.230 --> 05:02:42.240 align:start position:0%
and it was going to produce
 
05:02:43.350 --> 05:02:43.360 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:02:45.910 --> 05:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
not it costs you
 
05:02:49.910 --> 05:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
more to get the stuff uh the byproduct
 
05:02:51.510 --> 05:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
than it was the byproduct was going to
 
05:02:53.750 --> 05:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
be worth well nobody wants to do that
 
05:02:53.760 --> 05:02:54.628 align:start position:0%
be worth well nobody wants to do that
so

05:02:54.628 --> 05:02:54.638 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:02:56.470 --> 05:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
this procedure was going to
 
05:02:57.750 --> 05:02:57.760 align:start position:0%
was going to
 
05:02:57.760 --> 05:02:58.628 align:start position:0%
was going to
make

05:02:58.628 --> 05:02:58.638 align:start position:0%
make
 
05:03:00.310 --> 05:03:00.320 align:start position:0%
the stuff that was going to be more
 
05:03:04.070 --> 05:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:05.830 --> 05:03:05.840 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that that's still
 
05:03:08.948 --> 05:03:08.958 align:start position:0%
not being really done
 
05:03:10.868 --> 05:03:10.878 align:start position:0%
so what happened to that procedure it
 
05:03:12.628 --> 05:03:12.638 align:start position:0%
was being done out at keene state
 
05:03:16.230 --> 05:03:16.240 align:start position:0%
college what happened to that procedure
 
05:03:18.390 --> 05:03:18.400 align:start position:0%
yeah i know a lot of the alternative
 
05:03:20.948 --> 05:03:20.958 align:start position:0%
like energy uses when the market kind of
 
05:03:23.590 --> 05:03:23.600 align:start position:0%
went down and gas prices went down a lot
 
05:03:26.150 --> 05:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
of the alternative energy uses of things
 
05:03:28.230 --> 05:03:28.240 align:start position:0%
like brown grease is just kind of
 
05:03:33.910 --> 05:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:42.390 --> 05:03:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:44.948 --> 05:03:44.958 align:start position:0%
are you able to perhaps
 
05:03:46.868 --> 05:03:46.878 align:start position:0%
with all due respect quickly answer the
 
05:03:48.550 --> 05:03:48.560 align:start position:0%
representatives questions so we can try
 
05:03:51.910 --> 05:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:53.830 --> 05:03:53.840 align:start position:0%
yeah i just thought i did the price went
 
05:03:55.110 --> 05:03:55.120 align:start position:0%
down and those
 
05:03:57.190 --> 05:03:57.200 align:start position:0%
processes weren't viable and they they
 
05:03:59.110 --> 05:03:59.120 align:start position:0%
just didn't go anywhere so there was
 
05:04:00.948 --> 05:04:00.958 align:start position:0%
some biodiesel and some other things
 
05:04:02.550 --> 05:04:02.560 align:start position:0%
there was a thing at keene state college
 
05:04:04.390 --> 05:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
and they just all petered out because
 
05:04:06.310 --> 05:04:06.320 align:start position:0%
it's about 16 cents a gallon to get rid
 
05:04:11.910 --> 05:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:20.470 --> 05:04:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:22.070 --> 05:04:22.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:04:22.080 --> 05:04:26.708 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

05:04:26.708 --> 05:04:26.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:26.718 --> 05:04:27.010 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:04:27.010 --> 05:04:27.020 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:04:27.020 --> 05:04:29.270 align:start position:0%
so
[Music]

05:04:29.270 --> 05:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:04:32.708 --> 05:04:32.718 align:start position:0%
the purpose of all this
 
05:04:32.718 --> 05:04:33.670 align:start position:0%
the purpose of all this
right

05:04:33.670 --> 05:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:04:35.510 --> 05:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons why we do this is
 
05:04:36.788 --> 05:04:36.798 align:start position:0%
because we want to protect our
 
05:04:42.868 --> 05:04:42.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:42.878 --> 05:04:44.628 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:04:44.628 --> 05:04:44.638 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:04:47.430 --> 05:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
if we didn't want to do that
 
05:04:49.830 --> 05:04:49.840 align:start position:0%
it would not be important
 
05:04:52.310 --> 05:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
to maintain our septic systems or keep
 
05:04:54.628 --> 05:04:54.638 align:start position:0%
them from failing
 
05:04:54.638 --> 05:04:56.470 align:start position:0%
them from failing
correct

05:04:56.470 --> 05:04:56.480 align:start position:0%
correct
 
05:04:56.480 --> 05:04:57.430 align:start position:0%
correct
correct

05:04:57.430 --> 05:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
correct
 
05:04:59.670 --> 05:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
so the end result of all of this is
 
05:05:00.788 --> 05:05:00.798 align:start position:0%
because we want to protect our
 
05:05:00.798 --> 05:05:03.430 align:start position:0%
because we want to protect our
groundwater

05:05:03.430 --> 05:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
groundwater
 
05:05:05.510 --> 05:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
yes and by the very nature of the septic
 
05:05:07.350 --> 05:05:07.360 align:start position:0%
system that's what they are designed to
 
05:05:09.990 --> 05:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
do that's correct okay
 
05:05:12.470 --> 05:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
so last question i'm sorry i had so many
 
05:05:15.910 --> 05:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:17.990 --> 05:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
so the grease trap
 
05:05:20.628 --> 05:05:20.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:20.638 --> 05:05:21.830 align:start position:0%
 
in

05:05:21.830 --> 05:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:05:24.070 --> 05:05:24.080 align:start position:0%
parallel to the septic system or in
 
05:05:24.080 --> 05:05:26.550 align:start position:0%
parallel to the septic system or in
series

05:05:26.550 --> 05:05:26.560 align:start position:0%
series
 
05:05:28.868 --> 05:05:28.878 align:start position:0%
the grease trap would before the waste
 
05:05:31.350 --> 05:05:31.360 align:start position:0%
gets to your tank and then from the
 
05:05:33.510 --> 05:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
septic tank it goes to the leash field
 
05:05:36.708 --> 05:05:36.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:40.628 --> 05:05:40.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:43.030 --> 05:05:43.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair we i've heard
 
05:05:45.110 --> 05:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
we've all heard multiple times now that
 
05:05:47.990 --> 05:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
the ipc is not the appropriate code
 
05:05:49.830 --> 05:05:49.840 align:start position:0%
to be addressing this what is the
 
05:05:51.430 --> 05:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate code
 
05:05:53.990 --> 05:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
i think the appropriate code is the 1000
 
05:05:56.948 --> 05:05:56.958 align:start position:0%
rules that des oversees that regulate
 
05:06:00.470 --> 05:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
septic systems online on soil wastewater
 
05:06:03.430 --> 05:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
i would not want to rule out the ipc for
 
05:06:05.750 --> 05:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
the interior plumbing i think that's an
 
05:06:08.230 --> 05:06:08.240 align:start position:0%
important part of the process
 
05:06:10.390 --> 05:06:10.400 align:start position:0%
but from once that waste leaves the
 
05:06:12.070 --> 05:06:12.080 align:start position:0%
building and goes out your four inch
 
05:06:12.080 --> 05:06:12.948 align:start position:0%
building and goes out your four inch
pipe

05:06:12.948 --> 05:06:12.958 align:start position:0%
pipe
 
05:06:14.948 --> 05:06:14.958 align:start position:0%
that comes under the
 
05:06:19.670 --> 05:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:21.110 --> 05:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:06:23.270 --> 05:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
okay so the thousand rules that you're
 
05:06:25.910 --> 05:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
talking about here that des
 
05:06:28.150 --> 05:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
uses those are internally created or
 
05:06:30.948 --> 05:06:30.958 align:start position:0%
those from a national standard those are
 
05:06:33.430 --> 05:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
created and we go before jlk when we
 
05:06:39.350 --> 05:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:41.510 --> 05:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
representative bailey
 
05:06:42.788 --> 05:06:42.798 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:06:45.030 --> 05:06:45.040 align:start position:0%
um we've heard a lot about flow rates
 
05:06:47.350 --> 05:06:47.360 align:start position:0%
and grease receptacles and all of this
 
05:06:47.360 --> 05:06:48.310 align:start position:0%
and grease receptacles and all of this
but

05:06:48.310 --> 05:06:48.320 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:06:50.948 --> 05:06:50.958 align:start position:0%
where this began and the testimony we
 
05:06:52.708 --> 05:06:52.718 align:start position:0%
heard and what this picture shows is
 
05:06:55.750 --> 05:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
that they have zero graze grease and
 
05:07:00.230 --> 05:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
zero flow rate so why do they need
 
05:07:02.150 --> 05:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
and also that if you didn't have this it
 
05:07:03.990 --> 05:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
might cause a ten to fifteen thousand
 
05:07:05.510 --> 05:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
dollar expense
 
05:07:06.948 --> 05:07:06.958 align:start position:0%
and yet i'm thinking
 
05:07:09.910 --> 05:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
that must have cost a pretty penny
 
05:07:09.920 --> 05:07:10.788 align:start position:0%
that must have cost a pretty penny
so

05:07:10.788 --> 05:07:10.798 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:07:13.270 --> 05:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
why would you need all of this for zero
 
05:07:15.750 --> 05:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
grease well
 
05:07:17.650 --> 05:07:17.660 align:start position:0%
madam chair good
 
05:07:17.660 --> 05:07:18.830 align:start position:0%
madam chair good
[Music]

05:07:18.830 --> 05:07:18.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:07:22.230 --> 05:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
uh i'm trying to see as i talk i think
 
05:07:24.150 --> 05:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
when you look at their menu that they
 
05:07:26.788 --> 05:07:26.798 align:start position:0%
have food that produces grease
 
05:07:29.110 --> 05:07:29.120 align:start position:0%
now greases greases grease is grease now
 
05:07:31.190 --> 05:07:31.200 align:start position:0%
how that's disposed of we have no
 
05:07:32.868 --> 05:07:32.878 align:start position:0%
control over
 
05:07:32.878 --> 05:07:33.750 align:start position:0%
control over
so

05:07:33.750 --> 05:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:07:35.030 --> 05:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
when the
 
05:07:37.750 --> 05:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
hhns folks went out to issue a new food
 
05:07:39.350 --> 05:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
license they noticed that there was a
 
05:07:40.868 --> 05:07:40.878 align:start position:0%
change in menu
 
05:07:43.430 --> 05:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
hence that was brought to our attention
 
05:07:45.590 --> 05:07:45.600 align:start position:0%
and we saw that the system was not
 
05:07:49.110 --> 05:07:49.120 align:start position:0%
designed for greece so
 
05:07:49.120 --> 05:07:50.150 align:start position:0%
designed for greece so
that's

05:07:50.150 --> 05:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
that's
 
05:07:53.110 --> 05:07:53.120 align:start position:0%
what i know about that
 
05:07:55.350 --> 05:07:55.360 align:start position:0%
talking with the concrete folks and
 
05:07:57.510 --> 05:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
septic system installers to install a
 
05:07:59.990 --> 05:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
grease trap the cost of the trap and the
 
05:08:01.590 --> 05:08:01.600 align:start position:0%
installation somewhere around two
 
05:08:03.670 --> 05:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
05:08:03.680 --> 05:08:05.350 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
so

05:08:05.350 --> 05:08:05.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:08:07.270 --> 05:08:07.280 align:start position:0%
i don't know what people are paying but
 
05:08:09.590 --> 05:08:09.600 align:start position:0%
that's what we got from several people
 
05:08:13.190 --> 05:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
that install tanks and systems
 
05:08:13.200 --> 05:08:14.830 align:start position:0%
that install tanks and systems
thank

05:08:14.830 --> 05:08:14.840 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:08:19.430 --> 05:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:21.430 --> 05:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
05:08:23.030 --> 05:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
taking questions
 
05:08:23.040 --> 05:08:24.390 align:start position:0%
taking questions
um

05:08:24.390 --> 05:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:27.590 --> 05:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
first question i have is
 
05:08:28.948 --> 05:08:28.958 align:start position:0%
we hear
 
05:08:31.190 --> 05:08:31.200 align:start position:0%
that the international plumbing code
 
05:08:33.190 --> 05:08:33.200 align:start position:0%
that deals with the internal
 
05:08:33.200 --> 05:08:34.470 align:start position:0%
that deals with the internal
plumbing

05:08:34.470 --> 05:08:34.480 align:start position:0%
plumbing
 
05:08:36.708 --> 05:08:36.718 align:start position:0%
goes by flow rates when they set their
 
05:08:39.750 --> 05:08:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:42.550 --> 05:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
is there a standard flow rate
 
05:08:45.990 --> 05:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
for getting to a thousand gallon
 
05:08:46.000 --> 05:08:47.510 align:start position:0%
for getting to a thousand gallon
outside

05:08:47.510 --> 05:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
outside
 
05:08:47.520 --> 05:08:49.990 align:start position:0%
outside
tank

05:08:49.990 --> 05:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:52.470 --> 05:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
no we don't have a typical flow rate for
 
05:08:52.480 --> 05:08:53.270 align:start position:0%
no we don't have a typical flow rate for
that

05:08:53.270 --> 05:08:53.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:08:53.280 --> 05:08:55.190 align:start position:0%
that
follow

05:08:55.190 --> 05:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
follow
 
05:08:56.948 --> 05:08:56.958 align:start position:0%
i'm not asking whether you do is there a
 
05:08:58.470 --> 05:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
standard out there that deals with flow
 
05:09:00.070 --> 05:09:00.080 align:start position:0%
rates and the size of tanks that are
 
05:09:00.080 --> 05:09:01.110 align:start position:0%
rates and the size of tanks that are
available

05:09:01.110 --> 05:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
available
 
05:09:04.150 --> 05:09:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:08.628 --> 05:09:08.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:11.030 --> 05:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
is a thousand
 
05:09:13.270 --> 05:09:13.280 align:start position:0%
gallon tank a
 
05:09:14.788 --> 05:09:14.798 align:start position:0%
the smaller size they make or do they
 
05:09:17.510 --> 05:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
make outside tanks in smaller
 
05:09:19.750 --> 05:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
dimensions generally that you could get
 
05:09:22.470 --> 05:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
a 750 probably
 
05:09:25.030 --> 05:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
but we look at a thousand gallons
 
05:09:27.670 --> 05:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
because of the longevity of the tank the
 
05:09:29.830 --> 05:09:29.840 align:start position:0%
in frequency of pumping required because
 
05:09:31.590 --> 05:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
every time you have a tank pumped you're
 
05:09:33.750 --> 05:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
probably looking somewhere around 300
 
05:09:33.760 --> 05:09:35.030 align:start position:0%
probably looking somewhere around 300
350

05:09:35.030 --> 05:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
350
 
05:09:37.270 --> 05:09:37.280 align:start position:0%
so if you get into a larger tank which
 
05:09:39.830 --> 05:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
is that minimum of a thousand
 
05:09:39.840 --> 05:09:41.270 align:start position:0%
is that minimum of a thousand
financially

05:09:41.270 --> 05:09:41.280 align:start position:0%
financially
 
05:09:43.350 --> 05:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
you know the tank may cost a little more
 
05:09:45.590 --> 05:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
but you'll certainly recoup that cost
 
05:09:46.948 --> 05:09:46.958 align:start position:0%
because you won't have to bump this
 
05:09:49.190 --> 05:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
frequently that's where we establish the
 
05:09:49.200 --> 05:09:50.868 align:start position:0%
frequently that's where we establish the
1000.

05:09:50.868 --> 05:09:50.878 align:start position:0%
1000.
 
05:09:54.390 --> 05:09:54.400 align:start position:0%
one last follow-up
 
05:09:57.590 --> 05:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:59.670 --> 05:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
surrounding states require for the same
 
05:09:59.680 --> 05:10:01.190 align:start position:0%
surrounding states require for the same
setups

05:10:01.190 --> 05:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
setups
 
05:10:03.430 --> 05:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
do they have minimums minimum standards
 
05:10:07.670 --> 05:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
for these outside grease traps
 
05:10:09.910 --> 05:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
yeah massachusetts is a 40 hour
 
05:10:12.550 --> 05:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
retention time a thousand gallon minimum
 
05:10:12.560 --> 05:10:13.590 align:start position:0%
retention time a thousand gallon minimum
tank

05:10:13.590 --> 05:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
tank
 
05:10:15.590 --> 05:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
and i think vermont
 
05:10:17.830 --> 05:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
is similar to us but the one i remember
 
05:10:21.110 --> 05:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:23.430 --> 05:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
representative scitec
 
05:10:23.440 --> 05:10:24.550 align:start position:0%
representative scitec
um

05:10:24.550 --> 05:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:10:27.270 --> 05:10:27.280 align:start position:0%
what's this retention time what exactly
 
05:10:29.590 --> 05:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
is the flow rate have to do with it
 
05:10:34.390 --> 05:10:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:37.030 --> 05:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
so the retention time that's the time
 
05:10:38.948 --> 05:10:38.958 align:start position:0%
when the water enters the tank till it
 
05:10:40.948 --> 05:10:40.958 align:start position:0%
leaves the other end
 
05:10:43.110 --> 05:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
and that is what gives the grease the
 
05:10:44.788 --> 05:10:44.798 align:start position:0%
time to separate
 
05:10:47.590 --> 05:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
some greases will separate quickly
 
05:10:49.830 --> 05:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
such as the small interceptor is 30
 
05:10:51.350 --> 05:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
minutes protects the building because
 
05:10:52.708 --> 05:10:52.718 align:start position:0%
it's taking out that grease that'll
 
05:10:54.788 --> 05:10:54.798 align:start position:0%
adhere to the pipes immediately
 
05:10:58.390 --> 05:10:58.400 align:start position:0%
where the 36 hours allows more fats oils
 
05:11:00.470 --> 05:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
and greases to settle out
 
05:11:02.868 --> 05:11:02.878 align:start position:0%
so that it does not impact the septic
 
05:11:05.590 --> 05:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
system with the full load of those fats
 
05:11:09.830 --> 05:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:12.070 --> 05:11:12.080 align:start position:0%
did i hear flow rate what exactly is
 
05:11:12.080 --> 05:11:13.110 align:start position:0%
did i hear flow rate what exactly is
that

05:11:13.110 --> 05:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:11:15.350 --> 05:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
that's i know that what that is for
 
05:11:16.628 --> 05:11:16.638 align:start position:0%
well but
 
05:11:19.830 --> 05:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
what's what's that mean for a restaurant
 
05:11:21.750 --> 05:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
well be the you know the gallons per
 
05:11:22.868 --> 05:11:22.878 align:start position:0%
minute as it comes in you would
 
05:11:25.030 --> 05:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
calculate how long that gallons per
 
05:11:25.040 --> 05:11:26.070 align:start position:0%
calculate how long that gallons per
minute

05:11:26.070 --> 05:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
minute
 
05:11:29.350 --> 05:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
would take to sit in the
 
05:11:31.750 --> 05:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
three gallons per minute is a rating
 
05:11:33.910 --> 05:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
like two-bedroom house or
 
05:11:36.390 --> 05:11:36.400 align:start position:0%
uh what you how you would size a septic
 
05:11:38.390 --> 05:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
tank for a two-bedroom house a certain
 
05:11:40.788 --> 05:11:40.798 align:start position:0%
size restaurant has a certain flow rate
 
05:11:43.830 --> 05:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
is that all right it's a figure of merit
 
05:11:45.830 --> 05:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
yeah septic systems are designed on
 
05:11:47.990 --> 05:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
based on flow rate and that's based on
 
05:11:49.670 --> 05:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
let's say if you had a restaurant how
 
05:11:51.270 --> 05:11:51.280 align:start position:0%
many seats you have and what kind of
 
05:11:53.590 --> 05:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
services you were providing that gives
 
05:11:55.830 --> 05:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
you a baseline flow rate
 
05:11:58.150 --> 05:11:58.160 align:start position:0%
hypothetical because of your number of
 
05:12:00.868 --> 05:12:00.878 align:start position:0%
seats in the type of servings your
 
05:12:02.550 --> 05:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
ultimate flow rate that are going to
 
05:12:05.830 --> 05:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
dictate that 36 hour retention time are
 
05:12:08.070 --> 05:12:08.080 align:start position:0%
going to be based on if you went in and
 
05:12:10.708 --> 05:12:10.718 align:start position:0%
left the sink running for 10 hours
 
05:12:14.230 --> 05:12:14.240 align:start position:0%
you know so what we design flow rates
 
05:12:16.390 --> 05:12:16.400 align:start position:0%
for the leech field hydraulically to be
 
05:12:19.030 --> 05:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
able to take that water
 
05:12:25.910 --> 05:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:25.920 --> 05:12:30.390 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:12:30.390 --> 05:12:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:32.788 --> 05:12:32.798 align:start position:0%
so looking at this particular situation
 
05:12:36.470 --> 05:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:38.868 --> 05:12:38.878 align:start position:0%
could this not have been handled by a
 
05:12:40.948 --> 05:12:40.958 align:start position:0%
device a trap
 
05:12:44.150 --> 05:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
a collection unit internally and not
 
05:12:45.510 --> 05:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
something that would have had to been
 
05:12:48.470 --> 05:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
colossally created into this yard
 
05:12:49.830 --> 05:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
could this have just been handled with
 
05:12:54.310 --> 05:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:55.990 --> 05:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
well i think as we talk with
 
05:12:58.470 --> 05:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
representative aaron i think depending
 
05:13:00.550 --> 05:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
on the menus and depending on what we
 
05:13:02.628 --> 05:13:02.638 align:start position:0%
would consider the flow rates
 
05:13:04.310 --> 05:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
i think that would be something that
 
05:13:07.190 --> 05:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
certainly could be entertained over time
 
05:13:10.628 --> 05:13:10.638 align:start position:0%
it's not our goal at des to stymie
 
05:13:13.350 --> 05:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurial businesses but we also
 
05:13:16.070 --> 05:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
have a responsibility to protect the pro
 
05:13:18.390 --> 05:13:18.400 align:start position:0%
environment protect the people that have
 
05:13:20.310 --> 05:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
a large investment in the septic system
 
05:13:22.310 --> 05:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
whether it be this situation which is
 
05:13:25.350 --> 05:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
the individuals that are discharging but
 
05:13:27.750 --> 05:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
many of the situations we arrive at
 
05:13:29.510 --> 05:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
that's not the case
 
05:13:31.430 --> 05:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
and many people go in
 
05:13:33.430 --> 05:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
unbeknownst to them
 
05:13:36.470 --> 05:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
and and not understand what the ultimate
 
05:13:39.110 --> 05:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
result will be and the cost associated
 
05:13:41.350 --> 05:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
with it so i mean there's several
 
05:13:44.628 --> 05:13:44.638 align:start position:0%
nuances i guess one could entertain
 
05:13:47.430 --> 05:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
um and i think we
 
05:13:48.948 --> 05:13:48.958 align:start position:0%
when i had my conversation with
 
05:13:50.708 --> 05:13:50.718 align:start position:0%
representative aaron we thought that we
 
05:13:52.948 --> 05:13:52.958 align:start position:0%
could certainly take some time and think
 
05:13:54.628 --> 05:13:54.638 align:start position:0%
about it
 
05:13:56.708 --> 05:13:56.718 align:start position:0%
but this bill presents a real problem to
 
05:13:58.708 --> 05:13:58.718 align:start position:0%
us we think it's inappropriate to have
 
05:14:01.510 --> 05:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
ipc even in it
 
05:14:03.590 --> 05:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
we have some real concerns about that
 
05:14:05.830 --> 05:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
code for the drinking water side of the
 
05:14:07.670 --> 05:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
world as well
 
05:14:10.230 --> 05:14:10.240 align:start position:0%
so i i think we're always open to have a
 
05:14:11.990 --> 05:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
conversation about
 
05:14:14.390 --> 05:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
minimizing costs but maximizing the
 
05:14:15.910 --> 05:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
benefit so
 
05:14:17.510 --> 05:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
the answer is a long answer to your
 
05:14:19.110 --> 05:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
question but i think we could certainly
 
05:14:21.430 --> 05:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
talk about that
 
05:14:25.510 --> 05:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
but i don't think it's a legislative fix
 
05:14:26.190 --> 05:14:26.200 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
05:14:26.200 --> 05:14:28.470 align:start position:0%
okay so
[Music]

05:14:28.470 --> 05:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:14:31.430 --> 05:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
when dealing with this particular
 
05:14:34.868 --> 05:14:34.878 align:start position:0%
in other situations where you're
 
05:14:36.550 --> 05:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
at least from the lay person asking for
 
05:14:37.990 --> 05:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
something that seems extraordinarily
 
05:14:40.948 --> 05:14:40.958 align:start position:0%
ridiculous do you guys work and present
 
05:14:43.670 --> 05:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
the other options that are available
 
05:14:46.150 --> 05:14:46.160 align:start position:0%
for these folks to look at you know this
 
05:14:46.160 --> 05:14:46.948 align:start position:0%
for these folks to look at you know this
is

05:14:46.948 --> 05:14:46.958 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:14:48.230 --> 05:14:48.240 align:start position:0%
you know we're not we're not talking
 
05:14:50.628 --> 05:14:50.638 align:start position:0%
about buffalo wild wings here clearly
 
05:14:51.910 --> 05:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
right so
 
05:14:53.270 --> 05:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
i mean are you working with these folks
 
05:14:55.670 --> 05:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
or is this are we dealing in absolutes
 
05:14:58.470 --> 05:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
no i think if anyone we we pride
 
05:15:00.390 --> 05:15:00.400 align:start position:0%
ourselves in having
 
05:15:02.550 --> 05:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
pre-application meetings for any changes
 
05:15:04.150 --> 05:15:04.160 align:start position:0%
anybody wants to make whether it's a
 
05:15:06.550 --> 05:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
residential whether it's commercial
 
05:15:09.990 --> 05:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
we don't care this is a situation
 
05:15:10.000 --> 05:15:10.868 align:start position:0%
we don't care this is a situation
where

05:15:10.868 --> 05:15:10.878 align:start position:0%
where
 
05:15:12.868 --> 05:15:12.878 align:start position:0%
the health and food inspectors went out
 
05:15:14.550 --> 05:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
there was a change of use they brought
 
05:15:17.030 --> 05:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
it to our attention the septic system
 
05:15:18.150 --> 05:15:18.160 align:start position:0%
did not
 
05:15:21.430 --> 05:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
qualify for greece and a change in menu
 
05:15:22.708 --> 05:15:22.718 align:start position:0%
and then
 
05:15:25.190 --> 05:15:25.200 align:start position:0%
that's how it moved on
 
05:15:27.510 --> 05:15:27.520 align:start position:0%
but certainly anybody could call us up
 
05:15:29.910 --> 05:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
and saying hey i'm providing i'm selling
 
05:15:32.070 --> 05:15:32.080 align:start position:0%
sandwiches but now i want to sell fried
 
05:15:34.390 --> 05:15:34.400 align:start position:0%
clams what do i need to do what are my
 
05:15:34.400 --> 05:15:35.430 align:start position:0%
clams what do i need to do what are my
options

05:15:35.430 --> 05:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
options
 
05:15:39.430 --> 05:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
we that is always available always
 
05:15:40.788 --> 05:15:40.798 align:start position:0%
and that just didn't happen in this
 
05:15:40.798 --> 05:15:43.990 align:start position:0%
and that just didn't happen in this
situation

05:15:43.990 --> 05:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:46.390 --> 05:15:46.400 align:start position:0%
representative on zara
 
05:15:47.510 --> 05:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
05:15:50.070 --> 05:15:50.080 align:start position:0%
question i have a lot of them um
 
05:15:51.590 --> 05:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
over the years here
 
05:15:51.600 --> 05:15:53.190 align:start position:0%
over the years here
um

05:15:53.190 --> 05:15:53.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:15:55.430 --> 05:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
with the existing system in place it may
 
05:15:57.510 --> 05:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
have been answered earlier
 
05:15:59.510 --> 05:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
was this
 
05:16:02.150 --> 05:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
again was this new system needed
 
05:16:02.160 --> 05:16:03.590 align:start position:0%
again was this new system needed
and

05:16:03.590 --> 05:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:16:04.788 --> 05:16:04.798 align:start position:0%
was this
 
05:16:06.788 --> 05:16:06.798 align:start position:0%
prior system in the first
 
05:16:11.430 --> 05:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
photo here was it capable of handling
 
05:16:12.868 --> 05:16:12.878 align:start position:0%
like it was alluded to in the last
 
05:16:15.430 --> 05:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
representatives question of handling the
 
05:16:19.510 --> 05:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:21.190 --> 05:16:21.200 align:start position:0%
no the answer to that would be no i'm
 
05:16:22.868 --> 05:16:22.878 align:start position:0%
gonna pass around
 
05:16:24.390 --> 05:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
the menu
 
05:16:26.390 --> 05:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
and i want you to look at the menu and
 
05:16:29.510 --> 05:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
see in fact from uh knowledge of what
 
05:16:35.910 --> 05:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:35.920 --> 05:16:54.948 align:start position:0%
 
nope

05:16:54.948 --> 05:16:54.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:57.670 --> 05:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
are there any for are there any other
 
05:16:59.030 --> 05:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
questions from any of the members in the
 
05:16:59.040 --> 05:17:01.830 align:start position:0%
questions from any of the members in the
committee

05:17:01.830 --> 05:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:03.430 --> 05:17:03.440 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
 
05:17:05.430 --> 05:17:05.440 align:start position:0%
testimony gentlemen representative
 
05:17:08.390 --> 05:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
fellows are you waving your hand at me
 
05:17:10.788 --> 05:17:10.798 align:start position:0%
senator fellows
 
05:17:13.110 --> 05:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
so i i was surprised to hear you say
 
05:17:14.868 --> 05:17:14.878 align:start position:0%
that you're going to estimate the amount
 
05:17:16.628 --> 05:17:16.638 align:start position:0%
of grease that's going to be going into
 
05:17:18.948 --> 05:17:18.958 align:start position:0%
the septic system based on the menu
 
05:17:21.270 --> 05:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
because if they're doing a lot of fried
 
05:17:24.788 --> 05:17:24.798 align:start position:0%
food i assume that you're taking that
 
05:17:27.030 --> 05:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
grease and it's being recycled you're
 
05:17:29.750 --> 05:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
not pouring that down the sink are you
 
05:17:31.590 --> 05:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
i would i would almost think that you'd
 
05:17:33.510 --> 05:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
be getting more grease down the grain
 
05:17:35.430 --> 05:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
from the ice cream that you had to begin
 
05:17:37.430 --> 05:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
with because when it melts you put it in
 
05:17:38.470 --> 05:17:38.480 align:start position:0%
the sink
 
05:17:41.830 --> 05:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
so and and representative fellows
 
05:17:43.350 --> 05:17:43.360 align:start position:0%
i believe that the
 
05:17:45.430 --> 05:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
question i believe that the gentleman
 
05:17:47.110 --> 05:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
that is sitting next to representative
 
05:17:47.120 --> 05:17:48.070 align:start position:0%
that is sitting next to representative
aaron

05:17:48.070 --> 05:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
aaron
 
05:17:50.230 --> 05:17:50.240 align:start position:0%
does plan on testifying and whenever he
 
05:17:51.590 --> 05:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
is testifying you can certainly ask him
 
05:17:53.430 --> 05:17:53.440 align:start position:0%
any questions that you choose so i'm
 
05:17:54.948 --> 05:17:54.958 align:start position:0%
asking them
 
05:17:58.230 --> 05:17:58.240 align:start position:0%
why you think that the menu is important
 
05:18:00.230 --> 05:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
to look at because you seem to think
 
05:18:02.150 --> 05:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
that that means that they have more
 
05:18:04.948 --> 05:18:04.958 align:start position:0%
grease going into the septic system
 
05:18:07.190 --> 05:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
and i haven't seen it yet but if you're
 
05:18:09.990 --> 05:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
basing that on a lot of fried food
 
05:18:11.670 --> 05:18:11.680 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking that that
 
05:18:13.590 --> 05:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
fried food grease probably isn't going
 
05:18:15.750 --> 05:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
into the septic system a good question
 
05:18:17.910 --> 05:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
representative fellows if i had the
 
05:18:20.150 --> 05:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity to hire staff to go and see
 
05:18:22.868 --> 05:18:22.878 align:start position:0%
everybody's behavior and how they handle
 
05:18:24.788 --> 05:18:24.798 align:start position:0%
their grease that would be a different
 
05:18:27.110 --> 05:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
story we don't everybody does it
 
05:18:29.030 --> 05:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
differently depending on what they're
 
05:18:30.550 --> 05:18:30.560 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
05:18:32.390 --> 05:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
when we seed foods that when cooked
 
05:18:34.948 --> 05:18:34.958 align:start position:0%
generate grease we assume
 
05:18:37.270 --> 05:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
that the grease has got to be handled
 
05:18:39.510 --> 05:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
and maintained somehow whether it be
 
05:18:42.150 --> 05:18:42.160 align:start position:0%
anterior grease strap or exterior we
 
05:18:43.750 --> 05:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
have no way of
 
05:18:47.430 --> 05:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
monitoring how people handle that grease
 
05:18:49.910 --> 05:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
we know there's a potential it concerns
 
05:18:49.920 --> 05:18:50.628 align:start position:0%
we know there's a potential it concerns
us

05:18:50.628 --> 05:18:50.638 align:start position:0%
us
 
05:18:52.550 --> 05:18:52.560 align:start position:0%
from the septic system side the
 
05:18:54.070 --> 05:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
environmental side
 
05:18:56.070 --> 05:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
so that's why the standards are set the
 
05:18:59.430 --> 05:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
way they are we do not control behavior
 
05:19:02.150 --> 05:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
we just control and look at what is
 
05:19:04.868 --> 05:19:04.878 align:start position:0%
being produced and served
 
05:19:07.910 --> 05:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
and however they choose to add longevity
 
05:19:09.990 --> 05:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
to their system or not
 
05:19:13.270 --> 05:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
is up to them but with our minimums
 
05:19:15.670 --> 05:19:15.680 align:start position:0%
we feel comfortable that the environment
 
05:19:18.230 --> 05:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
is protected and also when you think the
 
05:19:20.230 --> 05:19:20.240 align:start position:0%
long-term maintenance of the tank the
 
05:19:21.830 --> 05:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
frequency of pumping which i talked
 
05:19:24.550 --> 05:19:24.560 align:start position:0%
about earlier at the end of the day
 
05:19:26.070 --> 05:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
that's why there's a thousand gallon
 
05:19:26.080 --> 05:19:28.788 align:start position:0%
that's why there's a thousand gallon
minimum

05:19:28.788 --> 05:19:28.798 align:start position:0%
minimum
 
05:19:31.590 --> 05:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:32.948 --> 05:19:32.958 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions from any
 
05:19:34.230 --> 05:19:34.240 align:start position:0%
of the members
 
05:19:36.550 --> 05:19:36.560 align:start position:0%
matt madam chair could i
 
05:19:38.470 --> 05:19:38.480 align:start position:0%
i don't want to take this hope
 
05:19:41.110 --> 05:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
i i do have some real concerns about the
 
05:19:43.430 --> 05:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
ipc language in this bill
 
05:19:45.590 --> 05:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
on the drinking water side
 
05:19:47.270 --> 05:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
as you may or may not know the drinking
 
05:19:49.350 --> 05:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
water systems have a lot of what we call
 
05:19:51.590 --> 05:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
backflow presenters so if there's a
 
05:19:53.670 --> 05:19:53.680 align:start position:0%
negative pressure in the system that
 
05:19:55.830 --> 05:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
wastewater doesn't get sucked back into
 
05:19:58.550 --> 05:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
the drinking water side
 
05:20:00.788 --> 05:20:00.798 align:start position:0%
that is a big concern for us having that
 
05:20:03.590 --> 05:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
language in this bill with the ipc which
 
05:20:05.750 --> 05:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
i think at the end of the day by the
 
05:20:07.750 --> 05:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
both on the water and wastewater side is
 
05:20:07.760 --> 05:20:09.670 align:start position:0%
both on the water and wastewater side is
inappropriate

05:20:09.670 --> 05:20:09.680 align:start position:0%
inappropriate
 
05:20:13.830 --> 05:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:24.230 --> 05:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:26.788 --> 05:20:26.798 align:start position:0%
this gives new meaning to the term hot
 
05:20:26.798 --> 05:20:29.910 align:start position:0%
this gives new meaning to the term hot
seat

05:20:29.910 --> 05:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:31.670 --> 05:20:31.680 align:start position:0%
my name is philip sherman i'm the chair
 
05:20:34.310 --> 05:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
of the building code review board and i
 
05:20:37.430 --> 05:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
began by intending to respectfully speak
 
05:20:40.628 --> 05:20:40.638 align:start position:0%
in opposition to this bill
 
05:20:42.390 --> 05:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
well at the same time now not
 
05:20:44.230 --> 05:20:44.240 align:start position:0%
necessarily disagreeing with
 
05:20:46.310 --> 05:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
representative aaron or representative
 
05:20:48.470 --> 05:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
mcguire's statements
 
05:20:50.628 --> 05:20:50.638 align:start position:0%
and well respectfully disagreeing with
 
05:20:52.230 --> 05:20:52.240 align:start position:0%
some of what was just said from the
 
05:20:55.510 --> 05:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services
 
05:20:59.750 --> 05:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
as it stands this bill violates rsa 155

05:21:05.190 --> 05:21:05.200 align:start position:0%

varying modifying or waiving the
 
05:21:09.270 --> 05:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
requirements of the state building code
 
05:21:11.670 --> 05:21:11.680 align:start position:0%
which includes the plumbing code unless
 
05:21:13.270 --> 05:21:13.280 align:start position:0%
approved by the building code review
 
05:21:14.708 --> 05:21:14.718 align:start position:0%
board leading to the required
 
05:21:17.590 --> 05:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
ratification by the legislature
 
05:21:19.670 --> 05:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
based on the international plumbing code
 
05:21:22.548 --> 05:21:22.558 align:start position:0%
definitions of plumbing system
 
05:21:24.070 --> 05:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
building sewer
 
05:21:26.230 --> 05:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
and water service pipe
 
05:21:28.788 --> 05:21:28.798 align:start position:0%
the scope of the plumbing code extends
 
05:21:31.270 --> 05:21:31.280 align:start position:0%
to the public sewer or the private
 
05:21:33.590 --> 05:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
sewage disposal system otherwise known
 
05:21:36.230 --> 05:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
as a septic system
 
05:21:38.548 --> 05:21:38.558 align:start position:0%
and to the public or the private water
 
05:21:41.350 --> 05:21:41.360 align:start position:0%
supply including the piping that gets
 
05:21:43.030 --> 05:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
them there
 
05:21:44.390 --> 05:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
in the last
 
05:21:47.430 --> 05:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
hour or so two hours i've heard three
 
05:21:49.030 --> 05:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
different definitions of where the
 
05:21:51.110 --> 05:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
plumbing code stops
 
05:21:53.110 --> 05:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
what i read in the book
 
05:21:55.910 --> 05:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
what i hear from des and what i heard
 
05:21:57.830 --> 05:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
from the plumbing licensing folks who
 
05:21:59.990 --> 05:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
think it stops at a dotted line 10 feet
 
05:22:02.070 --> 05:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
outside the building
 
05:22:04.230 --> 05:22:04.240 align:start position:0%
i think we may have a problem with
 
05:22:07.110 --> 05:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
simply how the various regulations here
 
05:22:10.150 --> 05:22:10.160 align:start position:0%
sew themselves together so that may need
 
05:22:12.150 --> 05:22:12.160 align:start position:0%
some work
 
05:22:13.750 --> 05:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
the plumbing code
 
05:22:16.628 --> 05:22:16.638 align:start position:0%
again using the definition in the book
 
05:22:19.030 --> 05:22:19.040 align:start position:0%
provides detailed requirements for both
 
05:22:21.910 --> 05:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
exterior and interior grease traps
 
05:22:24.310 --> 05:22:24.320 align:start position:0%
called grease interceptors in the code
 
05:22:26.708 --> 05:22:26.718 align:start position:0%
and similarly provides detailed
 
05:22:28.548 --> 05:22:28.558 align:start position:0%
requirements for other plumbing
 
05:22:30.230 --> 05:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
components which are referenced in the
 
05:22:30.240 --> 05:22:31.750 align:start position:0%
components which are referenced in the
bill

05:22:31.750 --> 05:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:22:34.788 --> 05:22:34.798 align:start position:0%
the des currently has the authority to
 
05:22:36.948 --> 05:22:36.958 align:start position:0%
submit any changes they desire to the
 
05:22:36.958 --> 05:22:38.390 align:start position:0%
submit any changes they desire to the
bcrb

05:22:38.390 --> 05:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
bcrb
 
05:22:40.310 --> 05:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
but no changes to the model code were
 
05:22:42.948 --> 05:22:42.958 align:start position:0%
proposed in the 2018 code package
 
05:22:44.788 --> 05:22:44.798 align:start position:0%
because they read the international
 
05:22:46.948 --> 05:22:46.958 align:start position:0%
plumbing code a different way
 
05:22:49.030 --> 05:22:49.040 align:start position:0%
nothing prohibits the des from creating
 
05:22:51.430 --> 05:22:51.440 align:start position:0%
their own permitting review or approval
 
05:22:54.150 --> 05:22:54.160 align:start position:0%
package based on the technical language
 
05:22:56.230 --> 05:22:56.240 align:start position:0%
in the plumbing code
 
05:22:58.230 --> 05:22:58.240 align:start position:0%
this bill and this is my critical point
 
05:23:00.310 --> 05:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
this bill would allow the des to amend
 
05:23:02.628 --> 05:23:02.638 align:start position:0%
the state building code without going
 
05:23:04.628 --> 05:23:04.638 align:start position:0%
through the normal amendment process
 
05:23:06.548 --> 05:23:06.558 align:start position:0%
which results in ratification by the
 
05:23:09.030 --> 05:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
legislature provided the requirements
 
05:23:10.390 --> 05:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
are no more restrictive than the
 
05:23:11.750 --> 05:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
plumbing code
 
05:23:13.910 --> 05:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
and would most likely lead other state
 
05:23:17.190 --> 05:23:17.200 align:start position:0%
agencies to request the same authority
 
05:23:19.270 --> 05:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
this would lead us farther away from the
 
05:23:22.548 --> 05:23:22.558 align:start position:0%
desired one-stop shopping provided by a
 
05:23:24.830 --> 05:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
statewide building
 
05:23:28.708 --> 05:23:28.718 align:start position:0%
code those were my prepared remarks
 
05:23:30.708 --> 05:23:30.718 align:start position:0%
and the situation has got it
 
05:23:33.830 --> 05:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
increasingly cloudy from my limited view
 
05:23:36.868 --> 05:23:36.878 align:start position:0%
of things uh by the way being new to
 
05:23:39.670 --> 05:23:39.680 align:start position:0%
this position six months ago
 
05:23:42.230 --> 05:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
and i and i do think that there needs to
 
05:23:44.310 --> 05:23:44.320 align:start position:0%
be a conversation between the parties
 
05:23:47.430 --> 05:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
involved the des and bcrb and probably
 
05:23:49.990 --> 05:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
the plumbing licensing folks
 
05:23:53.030 --> 05:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
and try and figure out what the extent
 
05:23:56.310 --> 05:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
is of the various regulations
 
05:23:57.990 --> 05:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
because clearly there's a disagreement
 
05:23:59.990 --> 05:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
there right now or at least
 
05:24:01.670 --> 05:24:01.680 align:start position:0%
each one is reading them properly in
 
05:24:02.628 --> 05:24:02.638 align:start position:0%
their own
 
05:24:04.628 --> 05:24:04.638 align:start position:0%
own context
 
05:24:07.030 --> 05:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
so i would hope that we could have some
 
05:24:07.040 --> 05:24:08.390 align:start position:0%
so i would hope that we could have some
time

05:24:08.390 --> 05:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:24:10.788 --> 05:24:10.798 align:start position:0%
to come back to this committee ideally
 
05:24:12.470 --> 05:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
with some agreement as to where this
 
05:24:14.470 --> 05:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
dotted line ought to be and who ought to
 
05:24:16.070 --> 05:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
write what rules
 
05:24:17.830 --> 05:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
although that may be opening a very
 
05:24:21.590 --> 05:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:25.830 --> 05:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:29.350 --> 05:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:31.430 --> 05:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
in my world uh what you just did is
 
05:24:34.150 --> 05:24:34.160 align:start position:0%
called throwing a grenade in the room
 
05:24:37.110 --> 05:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
my apologies no no no it's uh apparently
 
05:24:40.310 --> 05:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:42.070 --> 05:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
and i think you're right
 
05:24:46.070 --> 05:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:47.910 --> 05:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
we clearly have an interpretation war
 
05:24:49.270 --> 05:24:49.280 align:start position:0%
going on
 
05:24:51.990 --> 05:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
but at the end of the day
 
05:24:54.628 --> 05:24:54.638 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about here
 
05:24:54.638 --> 05:24:57.270 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about here
is

05:24:57.270 --> 05:24:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:57.280 --> 05:24:58.708 align:start position:0%
 
absolutes

05:24:58.708 --> 05:24:58.718 align:start position:0%
absolutes
 
05:24:58.718 --> 05:25:01.830 align:start position:0%
absolutes
and

05:25:01.830 --> 05:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:04.230 --> 05:25:04.240 align:start position:0%
to give you give a practical example of
 
05:25:05.990 --> 05:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
that absolute when i when i was in
 
05:25:07.910 --> 05:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
oklahoma city
 
05:25:10.310 --> 05:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
we had a standard response for fires in
 
05:25:11.590 --> 05:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
a restaurant and anybody that's ever
 
05:25:13.030 --> 05:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
seen a waffle house on the side of an
 
05:25:14.628 --> 05:25:14.638 align:start position:0%
interstate knows you can only fit about
 
05:25:16.830 --> 05:25:16.840 align:start position:0%
16 humans in it total including the
 
05:25:21.030 --> 05:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
cooks that response generated 41 firemen
 
05:25:21.040 --> 05:25:21.910 align:start position:0%
cooks that response generated 41 firemen
so

05:25:21.910 --> 05:25:21.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:25:23.350 --> 05:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
we couldn't even physically all go in
 
05:25:25.750 --> 05:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
the place but again absolutes it's a
 
05:25:25.760 --> 05:25:27.670 align:start position:0%
the place but again absolutes it's a
restaurant

05:25:27.670 --> 05:25:27.680 align:start position:0%
restaurant
 
05:25:29.110 --> 05:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
so what i'm getting at here with this is
 
05:25:30.470 --> 05:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
that you know it seems to me that we
 
05:25:32.708 --> 05:25:32.718 align:start position:0%
have some circumstances here that really
 
05:25:35.990 --> 05:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
require some discretion
 
05:25:39.910 --> 05:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:42.470 --> 05:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
flexibility by the es they may not have
 
05:25:44.470 --> 05:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
it this may be a jail car issue to deal
 
05:25:48.070 --> 05:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
with with some of this but
 
05:25:50.948 --> 05:25:50.958 align:start position:0%
right clearly
 
05:25:53.270 --> 05:25:53.280 align:start position:0%
we've we've applied things literally to
 
05:25:54.788 --> 05:25:54.798 align:start position:0%
situations that really don't warrant
 
05:25:54.798 --> 05:25:57.270 align:start position:0%
situations that really don't warrant
them

05:25:57.270 --> 05:25:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:59.270 --> 05:25:59.280 align:start position:0%
so i i would certainly encourage and ask
 
05:26:00.548 --> 05:26:00.558 align:start position:0%
that if you
 
05:26:02.548 --> 05:26:02.558 align:start position:0%
if any of the three groups here have a
 
05:26:04.390 --> 05:26:04.400 align:start position:0%
concept as to how to
 
05:26:06.548 --> 05:26:06.558 align:start position:0%
look at this more reasonably to to
 
05:26:09.110 --> 05:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
please bring it forward because
 
05:26:14.548 --> 05:26:14.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:14.558 --> 05:26:19.430 align:start position:0%
 
no

05:26:19.430 --> 05:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:21.990 --> 05:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
representative goalie
 
05:26:23.510 --> 05:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
05:26:24.948 --> 05:26:24.958 align:start position:0%
i just
 
05:26:26.868 --> 05:26:26.878 align:start position:0%
want to clarify i can
 
05:26:29.990 --> 05:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
make sure i heard what you said that
 
05:26:31.670 --> 05:26:31.680 align:start position:0%
there is
 
05:26:34.628 --> 05:26:34.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:36.390 --> 05:26:36.400 align:start position:0%
sizing for
 
05:26:38.788 --> 05:26:38.798 align:start position:0%
both internal and the external
 
05:26:43.190 --> 05:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:45.590 --> 05:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
there most definitely is i'm not
 
05:26:47.830 --> 05:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
prepared i'm not a plumbing engineer so
 
05:26:49.270 --> 05:26:49.280 align:start position:0%
i'm not prepared to speak to the
 
05:26:51.190 --> 05:26:51.200 align:start position:0%
technical details of anything that's in
 
05:26:54.150 --> 05:26:54.160 align:start position:0%
the plumbing code but the definition of
 
05:26:57.430 --> 05:26:57.440 align:start position:0%
grape grease interceptor clearly applies
 
05:26:59.590 --> 05:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
to interior and exterior
 
05:27:01.270 --> 05:27:01.280 align:start position:0%
furthermore the international code
 
05:27:01.280 --> 05:27:02.470 align:start position:0%
furthermore the international code
council

05:27:02.470 --> 05:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
council
 
05:27:04.708 --> 05:27:04.718 align:start position:0%
publishes more codes than the state of
 
05:27:07.430 --> 05:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
new hampshire adopts and they publish a
 
05:27:09.590 --> 05:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
code on what they call private sewage
 
05:27:12.150 --> 05:27:12.160 align:start position:0%
disposal systems septic tanks
 
05:27:13.670 --> 05:27:13.680 align:start position:0%
septic systems
 
05:27:13.680 --> 05:27:15.030 align:start position:0%
septic systems
and

05:27:15.030 --> 05:27:15.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:27:17.190 --> 05:27:17.200 align:start position:0%
the plumbing code and their sewage
 
05:27:19.750 --> 05:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
disposal code are melded they know where
 
05:27:21.750 --> 05:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
those begin and end and it begins at the
 
05:27:24.948 --> 05:27:24.958 align:start position:0%
entry to the sewage disposal system
 
05:27:24.958 --> 05:27:25.910 align:start position:0%
entry to the sewage disposal system
so

05:27:25.910 --> 05:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:27:27.830 --> 05:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
in terms of how our code is written i
 
05:27:29.990 --> 05:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
think it's fairly clear and i confirmed
 
05:27:31.430 --> 05:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
this with two other people with more
 
05:27:34.390 --> 05:27:34.400 align:start position:0%
experience this morning
 
05:27:36.150 --> 05:27:36.160 align:start position:0%
how it fits together with the des
 
05:27:37.990 --> 05:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
regulations i think need some work and
 
05:27:40.708 --> 05:27:40.718 align:start position:0%
we need to have a conversation and
 
05:27:42.548 --> 05:27:42.558 align:start position:0%
certainly happy to have it i do not
 
05:27:44.230 --> 05:27:44.240 align:start position:0%
think there's a war because a war takes
 
05:27:47.110 --> 05:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
two parties and at least
 
05:27:50.070 --> 05:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
it's a conversation that needs to happen
 
05:27:56.470 --> 05:27:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:57.750 --> 05:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
are there any other members that have
 
05:27:59.750 --> 05:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
05:28:01.910 --> 05:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
representative scitec my question my
 
05:28:03.430 --> 05:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
question is i don't know whose side i'm
 
05:28:04.470 --> 05:28:04.480 align:start position:0%
on here
 
05:28:06.548 --> 05:28:06.558 align:start position:0%
there's an aggrieved party we haven't
 
05:28:08.150 --> 05:28:08.160 align:start position:0%
heard from yet that seems to have been
 
05:28:10.230 --> 05:28:10.240 align:start position:0%
shut down almost preemptively without
 
05:28:10.240 --> 05:28:11.030 align:start position:0%
shut down almost preemptively without
any

05:28:11.030 --> 05:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
any
 
05:28:14.070 --> 05:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
i then i hear from des who seem to be
 
05:28:16.150 --> 05:28:16.160 align:start position:0%
very accommodating trying to live within
 
05:28:18.708 --> 05:28:18.718 align:start position:0%
their rules and we'll talk but something
 
05:28:20.948 --> 05:28:20.958 align:start position:0%
didn't work and i don't know how we're
 
05:28:23.270 --> 05:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
going to have this i'm just this isn't a
 
05:28:25.430 --> 05:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
question i'm taking advantage here we
 
05:28:28.470 --> 05:28:28.480 align:start position:0%
need this conversation somehow because
 
05:28:30.868 --> 05:28:30.878 align:start position:0%
everybody's wonderful but it didn't work
 
05:28:34.628 --> 05:28:34.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:36.628 --> 05:28:36.638 align:start position:0%
i suspect the executive session will be
 
05:28:41.590 --> 05:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:43.990 --> 05:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions
 
05:28:45.670 --> 05:28:45.680 align:start position:0%

any more pink cards but i do suspect
 
05:28:55.910 --> 05:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
that the oh

that's okay
yeah

well
 
05:30:14.708 --> 05:30:14.718 align:start position:0%
testify to your story i i must say that
 
05:30:16.470 --> 05:30:16.480 align:start position:0%
i did see your head shaking yes and no
 
05:30:18.150 --> 05:30:18.160 align:start position:0%
several times so hopefully you took some
 
05:30:19.990 --> 05:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
notes and you can clear up some of the
 
05:30:21.750 --> 05:30:21.760 align:start position:0%
questions that may have if there's any
 
05:30:23.190 --> 05:30:23.200 align:start position:0%
specific question that was asked by
 
05:30:24.868 --> 05:30:24.878 align:start position:0%
somebody if you want to address that but
 
05:30:27.510 --> 05:30:27.520 align:start position:0%
start with your story okay sure let's go
 
05:30:30.070 --> 05:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
with price we're a small business and
 
05:30:31.830 --> 05:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
price is a big deal for a small home
 
05:30:33.990 --> 05:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
business to start now we already went
 
05:30:36.788 --> 05:30:36.798 align:start position:0%
through the pricing we put we installed
 
05:30:38.868 --> 05:30:38.878 align:start position:0%
it i've been working in construction for
 
05:30:41.030 --> 05:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
40 years i work for a multi-million
 
05:30:42.628 --> 05:30:42.638 align:start position:0%
dollar construction form timberland
 
05:30:44.788 --> 05:30:44.798 align:start position:0%
construction i'm very familiar with
 
05:30:44.798 --> 05:30:45.990 align:start position:0%
construction i'm very familiar with
plans

05:30:45.990 --> 05:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
plans
 
05:30:48.230 --> 05:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
bid processing you know goes across my
 
05:30:51.030 --> 05:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
desk on a continuous basis so my wife
 
05:30:53.590 --> 05:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
asked me to step in when they said put a
 
05:30:55.510 --> 05:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
40 gallon grease trap and i said well go
 
05:30:58.628 --> 05:30:58.638 align:start position:0%
just do it well uh a thousand gallon and
 
05:31:00.628 --> 05:31:00.638 align:start position:0%
uh she says well
 
05:31:02.708 --> 05:31:02.718 align:start position:0%
would you look over the plants
 
05:31:04.628 --> 05:31:04.638 align:start position:0%
and that's when all this started
 
05:31:06.548 --> 05:31:06.558 align:start position:0%
because when i looked over the plans i
 
05:31:09.590 --> 05:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
started researching grease traps there's
 
05:31:12.390 --> 05:31:12.400 align:start position:0%
be colds and i come up with uh well this
 
05:31:13.990 --> 05:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
is gallons per minute
 
05:31:15.830 --> 05:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
i said they want me to put a thousand
 
05:31:18.708 --> 05:31:18.718 align:start position:0%
gallon grease trap and separate in a
 
05:31:20.230 --> 05:31:20.240 align:start position:0%
separate excuse me
 
05:31:22.948 --> 05:31:22.958 align:start position:0%
and in the ground and i said okay fine
 
05:31:22.958 --> 05:31:23.910 align:start position:0%
and in the ground and i said okay fine
uh

05:31:23.910 --> 05:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:31:26.708 --> 05:31:26.718 align:start position:0%
but we only put out 14
 
05:31:28.708 --> 05:31:28.718 align:start position:0%
uh gallons per minute
 
05:31:30.470 --> 05:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
they want me to put a thousand gallon
 
05:31:33.510 --> 05:31:33.520 align:start position:0%
interceptor which cars for 50 or more in
 
05:31:35.830 --> 05:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
my case is 250 or more with a thousand
 
05:31:35.840 --> 05:31:36.948 align:start position:0%
my case is 250 or more with a thousand
gallon

05:31:36.948 --> 05:31:36.958 align:start position:0%
gallon
 
05:31:38.628 --> 05:31:38.638 align:start position:0%
so i said well this is this is over
 
05:31:40.868 --> 05:31:40.878 align:start position:0%
engineering that's at its best and i
 
05:31:42.948 --> 05:31:42.958 align:start position:0%
deal with this all the time at work over
 
05:31:45.190 --> 05:31:45.200 align:start position:0%
engineering and when you over engineer
 
05:31:47.990 --> 05:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
something you always have problems and
 
05:31:49.830 --> 05:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
it's you look you can look up over
 
05:31:51.830 --> 05:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
engineering just problems
 
05:31:54.230 --> 05:31:54.240 align:start position:0%
always has problems so i was looking at
 
05:31:55.990 --> 05:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
this going uh it's you know this is not
 
05:31:57.830 --> 05:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
right so i started fighting with the dc
 
05:32:00.150 --> 05:32:00.160 align:start position:0%
yes about it i says well we only put out
 
05:32:02.948 --> 05:32:02.958 align:start position:0%
14. you want me to put a thought why
 
05:32:05.510 --> 05:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
i said so i had my uh septic system
 
05:32:08.150 --> 05:32:08.160 align:start position:0%
inspected this is no grease well we do
 
05:32:11.110 --> 05:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
fried food most of it's fried food well
 
05:32:12.868 --> 05:32:12.878 align:start position:0%
if you're more today's more than
 
05:32:15.430 --> 05:32:15.440 align:start position:0%
kitchens in modern restaurants
 
05:32:17.510 --> 05:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
they're not there cooking a steak on a
 
05:32:17.520 --> 05:32:18.708 align:start position:0%
they're not there cooking a steak on a
grill

05:32:18.708 --> 05:32:18.718 align:start position:0%
grill
 
05:32:21.110 --> 05:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
they buy you know if you if you have uh
 
05:32:23.270 --> 05:32:23.280 align:start position:0%
everything's frozen and pre-cooked
 
05:32:24.868 --> 05:32:24.878 align:start position:0%
so when we put in the fry later it's
 
05:32:26.708 --> 05:32:26.718 align:start position:0%
already pre-cooked there's no greasy
 
05:32:30.150 --> 05:32:30.160 align:start position:0%
foods doesn't no i'm sorry we serve on
 
05:32:33.030 --> 05:32:33.040 align:start position:0%
paper so again
 
05:32:34.948 --> 05:32:34.958 align:start position:0%
it's all self-contained uh we have table
 
05:32:36.948 --> 05:32:36.958 align:start position:0%
talk fry later is it self-contained
 
05:32:38.868 --> 05:32:38.878 align:start position:0%
there's many places that you can send
 
05:32:40.070 --> 05:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
the grease to
 
05:32:42.230 --> 05:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
well not the grease that oil to
 
05:32:44.230 --> 05:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
because they recycle it a lot of them
 
05:32:45.430 --> 05:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
permit it
 
05:32:47.510 --> 05:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
you can reburn oil get oil burners i
 
05:32:49.110 --> 05:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
could put one in my bond if i wanted to
 
05:32:51.270 --> 05:32:51.280 align:start position:0%
and take it and heat my bond there's
 
05:32:53.510 --> 05:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
reason you can recycle the oil and burn
 
05:32:56.070 --> 05:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
it as a fuel
 
05:32:57.750 --> 05:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
this is you know a class
 
05:32:59.430 --> 05:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
i think is class three or class five
 
05:33:01.270 --> 05:33:01.280 align:start position:0%
fuel which are considering that and the
 
05:33:03.270 --> 05:33:03.280 align:start position:0%
gentleman put up a brown grease brown
 
05:33:05.670 --> 05:33:05.680 align:start position:0%
grease is traded on the market today
 
05:33:07.830 --> 05:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
so it does have value
 
05:33:09.590 --> 05:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
and a good point because i you know
 
05:33:11.750 --> 05:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
that's something i also researched after
 
05:33:13.670 --> 05:33:13.680 align:start position:0%
i got into the whole grease thing
 
05:33:15.910 --> 05:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
as far as our licenses go
 
05:33:18.390 --> 05:33:18.400 align:start position:0%
we when we first started this
 
05:33:21.030 --> 05:33:21.040 align:start position:0%
we were going to ice cream and some food
 
05:33:23.670 --> 05:33:23.680 align:start position:0%
and like i said i'm only a 10 by 18 18
 
05:33:25.830 --> 05:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
shed shack whatever you want to call it
 
05:33:28.548 --> 05:33:28.558 align:start position:0%
i can't put all that much
 
05:33:30.548 --> 05:33:30.558 align:start position:0%
uh it's so we started it and the lady
 
05:33:32.548 --> 05:33:32.558 align:start position:0%
that came and inspected us i says well
 
05:33:34.788 --> 05:33:34.798 align:start position:0%
can you inspect our kitchen in the house
 
05:33:36.470 --> 05:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
because i would like to do soups and a
 
05:33:38.470 --> 05:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
few things and she says oh no you have
 
05:33:39.830 --> 05:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
everything here
 
05:33:41.350 --> 05:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
because we had the three base sink the
 
05:33:43.350 --> 05:33:43.360 align:start position:0%
hand washing station and she was you're
 
05:33:44.948 --> 05:33:44.958 align:start position:0%
all set what are you gonna you know a
 
05:33:46.708 --> 05:33:46.718 align:start position:0%
couple hot plates maybe a fries i said
 
05:33:48.310 --> 05:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
you had time put a couple
 
05:33:49.910 --> 05:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
countertop fry laters you're gonna be
 
05:33:51.510 --> 05:33:51.520 align:start position:0%
self-contained i said yes this is not a
 
05:33:51.520 --> 05:33:52.708 align:start position:0%
self-contained i said yes this is not a
problem

05:33:52.708 --> 05:33:52.718 align:start position:0%
problem
 
05:33:54.470 --> 05:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
it says you don't even need
 
05:33:55.910 --> 05:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
a grease trap i said you sure i'm
 
05:33:57.670 --> 05:33:57.680 align:start position:0%
putting in a full
 
05:34:00.708 --> 05:34:00.718 align:start position:0%
well the reason when we bought the house
 
05:34:00.718 --> 05:34:01.830 align:start position:0%
well the reason when we bought the house
uh

05:34:01.830 --> 05:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:34:03.750 --> 05:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
i checked the septic system like i said
 
05:34:06.070 --> 05:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm in construction i know i know my
 
05:34:08.708 --> 05:34:08.718 align:start position:0%
way around most things in construction
 
05:34:10.070 --> 05:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
and i found out one of the pipes led
 
05:34:11.510 --> 05:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
right down to the river
 
05:34:14.230 --> 05:34:14.240 align:start position:0%
i said good lord no this is horrible it
 
05:34:15.590 --> 05:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
happened when one of our grandchildren
 
05:34:17.190 --> 05:34:17.200 align:start position:0%
took a bath and they emptied it out and
 
05:34:18.470 --> 05:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
i smelled something down by the river
 
05:34:20.070 --> 05:34:20.080 align:start position:0%
and i found a pipe leading to the river
 
05:34:21.910 --> 05:34:21.920 align:start position:0%
i said well i capped it and i tore up
 
05:34:23.430 --> 05:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
the whole system
 
05:34:25.830 --> 05:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
and i put in a an advanced septic system
 
05:34:25.840 --> 05:34:27.270 align:start position:0%
and i put in a an advanced septic system
in

05:34:27.270 --> 05:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:34:29.350 --> 05:34:29.360 align:start position:0%
so it's more you know i'm a little bit
 
05:34:31.350 --> 05:34:31.360 align:start position:0%
i'm a little bit of a tree hugger i
 
05:34:34.230 --> 05:34:34.240 align:start position:0%
don't admit it where i live but you know
 
05:34:36.390 --> 05:34:36.400 align:start position:0%
i'd uh
 
05:34:38.470 --> 05:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
i believe in uh you know equality and
 
05:34:41.430 --> 05:34:41.440 align:start position:0%
you know clean rivers and all that so
 
05:34:43.270 --> 05:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
what we did is we put an advanced system
 
05:34:43.280 --> 05:34:44.150 align:start position:0%
what we did is we put an advanced system
in

05:34:44.150 --> 05:34:44.160 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:34:44.160 --> 05:34:45.510 align:start position:0%
in
um

05:34:45.510 --> 05:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:46.948 --> 05:34:46.958 align:start position:0%
so i put the system in but when i was
 
05:34:48.788 --> 05:34:48.798 align:start position:0%
putting the system in for because i
 
05:34:50.788 --> 05:34:50.798 align:start position:0%
asked how much do i need for a ice cream
 
05:34:52.390 --> 05:34:52.400 align:start position:0%
scoop because they have to have
 
05:34:54.628 --> 05:34:54.638 align:start position:0%
i think it's 350 gallons a day
 
05:34:56.708 --> 05:34:56.718 align:start position:0%
goes through for an ice cream ice cream
 
05:34:56.718 --> 05:34:57.670 align:start position:0%
goes through for an ice cream ice cream
scoop

05:34:57.670 --> 05:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
scoop
 
05:34:58.868 --> 05:34:58.878 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
05:35:00.788 --> 05:35:00.798 align:start position:0%
they so i had to put in a certain size
 
05:35:02.788 --> 05:35:02.798 align:start position:0%
system for that and i said do i need a
 
05:35:04.070 --> 05:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
grease trap
 
05:35:05.590 --> 05:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
because i had everything torn open they
 
05:35:07.430 --> 05:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
said oh no you're fine so i said okay
 
05:35:09.030 --> 05:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
great so we started doing what we were
 
05:35:09.040 --> 05:35:09.910 align:start position:0%
great so we started doing what we were
doing

05:35:09.910 --> 05:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
doing
 
05:35:12.390 --> 05:35:12.400 align:start position:0%
and then uh
 
05:35:14.868 --> 05:35:14.878 align:start position:0%
a person that lived in goshen
 
05:35:17.270 --> 05:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
that was a select man was a selectman
 
05:35:18.948 --> 05:35:18.958 align:start position:0%
he called the state now he he likes
 
05:35:20.788 --> 05:35:20.798 align:start position:0%
doing uh septic systems that's one of
 
05:35:22.470 --> 05:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
his things but he owns a trailer park
 
05:35:23.910 --> 05:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
one of those trailer parks in new
 
05:35:26.390 --> 05:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire actually
 
05:35:26.400 --> 05:35:27.350 align:start position:0%
hampshire actually
well

05:35:27.350 --> 05:35:27.360 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:35:29.030 --> 05:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
he called the state he made a complaint
 
05:35:31.270 --> 05:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
saying i didn't have a grease trap
 
05:35:33.990 --> 05:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
and he knew i didn't have crease hats so
 
05:35:37.190 --> 05:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
when they sent the next uh
 
05:35:39.430 --> 05:35:39.440 align:start position:0%
food handles license
 
05:35:41.830 --> 05:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
it said ice cream only now it's i don't
 
05:35:43.830 --> 05:35:43.840 align:start position:0%
know if you you get these you take them
 
05:35:45.830 --> 05:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
you you slide you slide it over into the
 
05:35:48.070 --> 05:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
glass you hang it up and you say okay
 
05:35:50.708 --> 05:35:50.718 align:start position:0%
it's down because we already had this
 
05:35:52.548 --> 05:35:52.558 align:start position:0%
so then he sent somebody over to look at
 
05:35:54.470 --> 05:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
it and says well you only have ice cream
 
05:35:56.548 --> 05:35:56.558 align:start position:0%
only so i called the state
 
05:35:58.150 --> 05:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
i said let's take care of it they said
 
05:35:59.350 --> 05:35:59.360 align:start position:0%
okay the
 
05:36:00.948 --> 05:36:00.958 align:start position:0%
pandemic hit
 
05:36:02.628 --> 05:36:02.638 align:start position:0%
everything was a little bit crazy back
 
05:36:04.868 --> 05:36:04.878 align:start position:0%
then we were the one the only places
 
05:36:06.788 --> 05:36:06.798 align:start position:0%
open to serve food
 
05:36:09.030 --> 05:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
now we we actually uh volunteer some of
 
05:36:11.750 --> 05:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
our so my wife cook soup during the week
 
05:36:13.270 --> 05:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
and so with the fire department and we
 
05:36:15.510 --> 05:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
serve it throughout the community
 
05:36:17.430 --> 05:36:17.440 align:start position:0%
for you know we just do that you know to
 
05:36:19.350 --> 05:36:19.360 align:start position:0%
help the community out and so we had
 
05:36:22.470 --> 05:36:22.480 align:start position:0%
these functions going already and uh
 
05:36:25.110 --> 05:36:25.120 align:start position:0%
so we didn't hear anything from anybody
 
05:36:27.190 --> 05:36:27.200 align:start position:0%
i called the state just radio silence
 
05:36:30.150 --> 05:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
from them and i you know said what well
 
05:36:30.160 --> 05:36:31.030 align:start position:0%
from them and i you know said what well
uh

05:36:31.030 --> 05:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:36:32.230 --> 05:36:32.240 align:start position:0%
actually the person i was dealing with
 
05:36:33.750 --> 05:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
the state was very nice they were kind
 
05:36:35.590 --> 05:36:35.600 align:start position:0%
the ds was very nice to me
 
05:36:37.190 --> 05:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
i said we'll get this straightened out
 
05:36:38.948 --> 05:36:38.958 align:start position:0%
and stuff and i go okay
 
05:36:41.510 --> 05:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
so i you know so i wanted to put a type
 
05:36:43.910 --> 05:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
of uh grease trap in anyway i says well
 
05:36:45.670 --> 05:36:45.680 align:start position:0%
let's run a groove strap all i wash is
 
05:36:49.670 --> 05:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
like a pan and in three or four tongs
 
05:36:51.670 --> 05:36:51.680 align:start position:0%
because it's all self-contained
 
05:36:53.670 --> 05:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
i mean i cook hamburger but the
 
05:36:55.990 --> 05:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
hamburger has a top griddle it has a
 
05:36:57.510 --> 05:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
grease trap on it
 
05:36:59.110 --> 05:36:59.120 align:start position:0%
so i just take that and dispose of the
 
05:37:00.230 --> 05:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
grease trap
 
05:37:01.750 --> 05:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
we all have wood stoves here in new
 
05:37:03.750 --> 05:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire we know where that can go
 
05:37:05.190 --> 05:37:05.200 align:start position:0%
i mean for a lot of different things
 
05:37:07.510 --> 05:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
when you wipe it out with a rag
 
05:37:09.670 --> 05:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
wall with a paper towel you know you can
 
05:37:10.948 --> 05:37:10.958 align:start position:0%
burn it or whatever because it is
 
05:37:12.788 --> 05:37:12.798 align:start position:0%
secondary fuel anyway
 
05:37:14.310 --> 05:37:14.320 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
05:37:16.628 --> 05:37:16.638 align:start position:0%
so i had that done and they they find
 
05:37:19.350 --> 05:37:19.360 align:start position:0%
out they came we uh we went to the
 
05:37:21.830 --> 05:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
pandemic and then we had the uh
 
05:37:23.590 --> 05:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
what was the uh
 
05:37:25.190 --> 05:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
that came
 
05:37:27.830 --> 05:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
oh chronicle came so chrono came so it
 
05:37:29.030 --> 05:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
was a big deal i mean chronicle's
 
05:37:31.670 --> 05:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
showing up we have fitz coming in this
 
05:37:33.110 --> 05:37:33.120 align:start position:0%
was a you know it's a big deal to us
 
05:37:35.270 --> 05:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
we're very small you know a little hole
 
05:37:36.548 --> 05:37:36.558 align:start position:0%
in the wall everybody laughed when we
 
05:37:37.910 --> 05:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
first opened it up because nobody was
 
05:37:40.310 --> 05:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
showing up i don't advertise anybody
 
05:37:42.070 --> 05:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
it's just word of mouth my wife's a
 
05:37:43.910 --> 05:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
professional chef once they get a get a
 
05:37:45.510 --> 05:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
hold of her different you know specials
 
05:37:47.110 --> 05:37:47.120 align:start position:0%
they're like oh my god this is great and
 
05:37:48.548 --> 05:37:48.558 align:start position:0%
we keep the price down because we live
 
05:37:49.750 --> 05:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
in a
 
05:37:52.310 --> 05:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
uh not the richest area i like to call
 
05:37:53.750 --> 05:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
we're on the uh
 
05:37:55.510 --> 05:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
the shadow of mount sunapee that's where
 
05:37:57.270 --> 05:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
i live we're on the other side of the
 
05:37:57.280 --> 05:37:58.628 align:start position:0%
i live we're on the other side of the
mountain

05:37:58.628 --> 05:37:58.638 align:start position:0%
mountain
 
05:37:58.638 --> 05:37:59.510 align:start position:0%
mountain
so

05:37:59.510 --> 05:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:38:01.190 --> 05:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
well anyway they come up and they come
 
05:38:03.750 --> 05:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
down whoa you need a grease trap i go
 
05:38:05.990 --> 05:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
okay fine we'll install grease trap in
 
05:38:08.310 --> 05:38:08.320 align:start position:0%
here you know what it i checked out 14
 
05:38:09.990 --> 05:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
gallons we need a 40 pound grease trap
 
05:38:12.070 --> 05:38:12.080 align:start position:0%
it's not a big deal they come back oh no
 
05:38:13.990 --> 05:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
no no you need a thousand gallon
 
05:38:14.000 --> 05:38:15.350 align:start position:0%
no no you need a thousand gallon
incinerator

05:38:15.350 --> 05:38:15.360 align:start position:0%
incinerator
 
05:38:16.708 --> 05:38:16.718 align:start position:0%
well this is and that's when i got
 
05:38:18.390 --> 05:38:18.400 align:start position:0%
involved with the septic that's when i
 
05:38:19.990 --> 05:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
started getting involved and i did a lot
 
05:38:23.190 --> 05:38:23.200 align:start position:0%
of research on grease disposal of greece
 
05:38:26.150 --> 05:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
interceptors how large how small they
 
05:38:27.110 --> 05:38:27.120 align:start position:0%
says oh
 
05:38:29.270 --> 05:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
i talked to do yes and i says okay this
 
05:38:31.350 --> 05:38:31.360 align:start position:0%
is ridiculous a thousand gallon i said
 
05:38:33.030 --> 05:38:33.040 align:start position:0%
it's the size of my building
 
05:38:34.788 --> 05:38:34.798 align:start position:0%
i says and never mind breaking ground
 
05:38:36.310 --> 05:38:36.320 align:start position:0%
and what it's going to cost says well
 
05:38:38.390 --> 05:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
you can get a 500 but you're limited to
 
05:38:39.510 --> 05:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
what you can do
 
05:38:41.270 --> 05:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
and i go well the difference between a
 
05:38:43.830 --> 05:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
500 cement one and a thousand
 
05:38:47.110 --> 05:38:47.120 align:start position:0%
is zero volts 300 in price but you still
 
05:38:49.190 --> 05:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
got to break ground you still got to buy
 
05:38:50.390 --> 05:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
the same pipes
 
05:38:52.788 --> 05:38:52.798 align:start position:0%
you gotta you gotta the labor and
 
05:38:54.070 --> 05:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
another thing they don't you know you
 
05:38:55.830 --> 05:38:55.840 align:start position:0%
have to have it designed
 
05:38:57.270 --> 05:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
i mean they said well this last time
 
05:38:58.788 --> 05:38:58.798 align:start position:0%
it's two thousand dollars it's fifteen
 
05:39:00.548 --> 05:39:00.558 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars just to get a designer
 
05:39:02.070 --> 05:39:02.080 align:start position:0%
out there design it before you even
 
05:39:03.990 --> 05:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
break ground it's twenty five hundred
 
05:39:05.590 --> 05:39:05.600 align:start position:0%
dollars just for the cement thousand
 
05:39:07.990 --> 05:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
gallon incinerator that's without pipes
 
05:39:09.590 --> 05:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
now you're gonna have people come down
 
05:39:10.868 --> 05:39:10.878 align:start position:0%
and put it in
 
05:39:15.110 --> 05:39:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:17.030 --> 05:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
septic designer
 
05:39:19.190 --> 05:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
put put install the system and that's
 
05:39:20.708 --> 05:39:20.718 align:start position:0%
going to cost you money
 
05:39:22.868 --> 05:39:22.878 align:start position:0%
so you know the money keeps on piling up
 
05:39:24.390 --> 05:39:24.400 align:start position:0%
i don't know where people are getting
 
05:39:25.990 --> 05:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
these prices
 
05:39:28.470 --> 05:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
i mean what they've told her
 
05:39:30.788 --> 05:39:30.798 align:start position:0%
you know a number occasion the des the
 
05:39:33.590 --> 05:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
waste manage is they they've underplayed
 
05:39:35.910 --> 05:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
this so much
 
05:39:38.150 --> 05:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
i i understand that you know hey i want
 
05:39:39.670 --> 05:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
to have clean water
 
05:39:41.510 --> 05:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
i mean the biggest thing is you know
 
05:39:43.430 --> 05:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
they're talking about grease grease dams
 
05:39:45.270 --> 05:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
which happen in the cities
 
05:39:46.628 --> 05:39:46.638 align:start position:0%
because you have grease dams that's what
 
05:39:48.470 --> 05:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
they run across these grease dams and
 
05:39:50.070 --> 05:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
they have a big problem with grease
 
05:39:52.548 --> 05:39:52.558 align:start position:0%
because you have different facilities
 
05:39:54.390 --> 05:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
do different amounts of grease but they
 
05:39:56.310 --> 05:39:56.320 align:start position:0%
have people that come and inspect your
 
05:39:58.548 --> 05:39:58.558 align:start position:0%
facility they know exactly what you do
 
05:40:00.868 --> 05:40:00.878 align:start position:0%
how many people you serve it's it's all
 
05:40:02.310 --> 05:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
on you know they all come and expect
 
05:40:04.628 --> 05:40:04.638 align:start position:0%
that they know what your menu is they
 
05:40:06.230 --> 05:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
know if you serve on paper if you serve
 
05:40:07.510 --> 05:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
on plastic
 
05:40:10.070 --> 05:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
you know we don't have no seating zero
 
05:40:12.070 --> 05:40:12.080 align:start position:0%
seating at our facility they knew that
 
05:40:13.990 --> 05:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
we served strictly on paper i don't
 
05:40:16.150 --> 05:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
serve any styrofoam because it's bad for
 
05:40:18.868 --> 05:40:18.878 align:start position:0%
the environment i pay extra for paper
 
05:40:21.030 --> 05:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
in fact i try to get recycled paper as
 
05:40:23.350 --> 05:40:23.360 align:start position:0%
much as possible and very very little
 
05:40:26.230 --> 05:40:26.240 align:start position:0%
plastic with my plastic forks and spoons
 
05:40:27.750 --> 05:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
i'm next to gunnison lake i don't want
 
05:40:29.990 --> 05:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
people going down there and leaving uh
 
05:40:32.070 --> 05:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
trash down at gunnison lake i want to be
 
05:40:32.948 --> 05:40:32.958 align:start position:0%
able to
 
05:40:34.470 --> 05:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
road if they do
 
05:40:35.990 --> 05:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
if anybody's seen one of those staff
 
05:40:37.830 --> 05:40:37.840 align:start position:0%
from comps in the woods you realize they
 
05:40:39.910 --> 05:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
just last forever but we're very
 
05:40:42.390 --> 05:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
conscious and it's that this is my story
 
05:40:44.150 --> 05:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
and this is what we've done
 
05:40:50.150 --> 05:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:52.548 --> 05:40:52.558 align:start position:0%
did you see a copy of them of the menu
 
05:40:54.070 --> 05:40:54.080 align:start position:0%
that was passed around you have that
 
05:40:56.948 --> 05:40:56.958 align:start position:0%
this is your menu okay yes
 
05:40:59.430 --> 05:40:59.440 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
05:41:01.590 --> 05:41:01.600 align:start position:0%
yes can you just tell me what was
 
05:41:03.750 --> 05:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
you you did install what they asked you
 
05:41:05.270 --> 05:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
to install
 
05:41:07.910 --> 05:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
yes we're 100 right now we have all the
 
05:41:10.230 --> 05:41:10.240 align:start position:0%
permits we're not here for us at this
 
05:41:10.240 --> 05:41:11.350 align:start position:0%
permits we're not here for us at this
point

05:41:11.350 --> 05:41:11.360 align:start position:0%
point
 
05:41:12.310 --> 05:41:12.320 align:start position:0%
this is
 
05:41:14.310 --> 05:41:14.320 align:start position:0%
it's over engineered and that drives me
 
05:41:14.320 --> 05:41:15.910 align:start position:0%
it's over engineered and that drives me
crazy

05:41:15.910 --> 05:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
crazy
 
05:41:17.990 --> 05:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
so i guess we're just here because we
 
05:41:18.948 --> 05:41:18.958 align:start position:0%
don't want
 
05:41:20.470 --> 05:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
we want to try to fix it so that it
 
05:41:22.788 --> 05:41:22.798 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen to somebody else okay
 
05:41:24.948 --> 05:41:24.958 align:start position:0%
do you want to share how much it cost
 
05:41:27.030 --> 05:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
you to do this
 
05:41:28.628 --> 05:41:28.638 align:start position:0%
sure uh
 
05:41:30.150 --> 05:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
it was fifteen hundred dollars for the
 
05:41:31.910 --> 05:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh designer
 
05:41:33.110 --> 05:41:33.120 align:start position:0%
it was another
 
05:41:35.590 --> 05:41:35.600 align:start position:0%
twenty five hundred dollars
 
05:41:35.600 --> 05:41:36.868 align:start position:0%
twenty five hundred dollars
for

05:41:36.868 --> 05:41:36.878 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:41:38.868 --> 05:41:38.878 align:start position:0%
the pipes in tank
 
05:41:40.628 --> 05:41:40.638 align:start position:0%
and then it was another four thousand i
 
05:41:41.830 --> 05:41:41.840 align:start position:0%
got a good deal because i'm friend of
 
05:41:46.628 --> 05:41:46.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:47.670 --> 05:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
and i
 
05:41:49.350 --> 05:41:49.360 align:start position:0%
this was on that i got the uh a good
 
05:41:51.750 --> 05:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
deal without readings we actually have
 
05:41:53.430 --> 05:41:53.440 align:start position:0%
their uh
 
05:41:55.350 --> 05:41:55.360 align:start position:0%
we have their maple syrup so i got a
 
05:42:06.070 --> 05:42:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:08.310 --> 05:42:08.320 align:start position:0%
representative linsara
 
05:42:10.868 --> 05:42:10.878 align:start position:0%
uh was this menu being served on the old
 
05:42:13.750 --> 05:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
system and if so for how long
 
05:42:16.230 --> 05:42:16.240 align:start position:0%
were there any issues yes it was uh we
 
05:42:17.990 --> 05:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
had this for close to what two and a
 
05:42:20.310 --> 05:42:20.320 align:start position:0%
half years
 
05:42:21.910 --> 05:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
well not the whole menu i mean we've
 
05:42:23.830 --> 05:42:23.840 align:start position:0%
added as we've gone the menu goes
 
05:42:25.510 --> 05:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
because fried foods fried food i mean
 
05:42:26.948 --> 05:42:26.958 align:start position:0%
you can go with uh
 
05:42:28.788 --> 05:42:28.798 align:start position:0%
chicken wings chicken drums and it just
 
05:42:30.390 --> 05:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
add you know it's the same thing it's
 
05:42:31.830 --> 05:42:31.840 align:start position:0%
the same process
 
05:42:34.868 --> 05:42:34.878 align:start position:0%
but uh yeah and i had my septa tank
 
05:42:37.510 --> 05:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
inspected by certified inspector that if
 
05:42:39.670 --> 05:42:39.680 align:start position:0%
that installs you saw absolutely no
 
05:42:42.150 --> 05:42:42.160 align:start position:0%
grease after we've been running for at
 
05:42:44.390 --> 05:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
least a few years i'm basically close to
 
05:42:52.628 --> 05:42:52.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:54.708 --> 05:42:54.718 align:start position:0%
representative allegro
 
05:42:57.670 --> 05:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i uh i have to ask
 
05:42:59.030 --> 05:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
i'm really curious i'm looking at the
 
05:43:01.670 --> 05:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
picture but it's hard for me to discern
 
05:43:03.270 --> 05:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
can you give me an estimate of what the
 
05:43:05.190 --> 05:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
actual dimensions of that grease trap
 
05:43:05.200 --> 05:43:07.350 align:start position:0%
actual dimensions of that grease trap
are

05:43:07.350 --> 05:43:07.360 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:43:08.470 --> 05:43:08.480 align:start position:0%
just rough
 
05:43:13.510 --> 05:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:13.520 --> 05:43:14.310 align:start position:0%
 
eight

05:43:14.310 --> 05:43:14.320 align:start position:0%
eight
 
05:43:18.628 --> 05:43:18.638 align:start position:0%
eight feet by five feet by
 
05:43:20.948 --> 05:43:20.958 align:start position:0%
maybe eight feet maybe ten feet by eight
 
05:43:22.390 --> 05:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
feet by five
 
05:43:27.030 --> 05:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:28.788 --> 05:43:28.798 align:start position:0%
representative bailey
 
05:43:30.628 --> 05:43:30.638 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:43:33.590 --> 05:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
the missing piece for me seems to be
 
05:43:35.670 --> 05:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
such greases you're making isn't going
 
05:43:37.830 --> 05:43:37.840 align:start position:0%
into this right
 
05:43:40.310 --> 05:43:40.320 align:start position:0%
no that's so this is all compl
 
05:43:42.390 --> 05:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
everything about flow rates and size of
 
05:43:44.868 --> 05:43:44.878 align:start position:0%
tanks it's all completely irrelevant
 
05:43:44.878 --> 05:43:47.270 align:start position:0%
tanks it's all completely irrelevant
right

05:43:47.270 --> 05:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:49.990 --> 05:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
yeah it is but to be honest with you why
 
05:43:51.590 --> 05:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
it says we should protect you know
 
05:43:53.990 --> 05:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
environment so the flow rate it's what
 
05:43:56.470 --> 05:43:56.480 align:start position:0%
you have if you have a three base sink
 
05:43:58.548 --> 05:43:58.558 align:start position:0%
it goes by your dimensions so if you're
 
05:44:01.270 --> 05:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
three three basic like mine is 10 by 14
 
05:44:01.280 --> 05:44:02.548 align:start position:0%
three three basic like mine is 10 by 14
by

05:44:02.548 --> 05:44:02.558 align:start position:0%
by
 
05:44:02.558 --> 05:44:03.350 align:start position:0%
by
10

05:44:03.350 --> 05:44:03.360 align:start position:0%
10
 
05:44:04.868 --> 05:44:04.878 align:start position:0%
and that's three bays and then you have
 
05:44:07.350 --> 05:44:07.360 align:start position:0%
a hand washer station which is also 10
 
05:44:09.910 --> 05:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
by 14 by five so they take these
 
05:44:11.910 --> 05:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
dimensions in and that gives you the
 
05:44:13.990 --> 05:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
gallons per minute that goes out
 
05:44:15.910 --> 05:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
so i do 14 so
 
05:44:17.830 --> 05:44:17.840 align:start position:0%
whatever i wash in there it's you know
 
05:44:19.510 --> 05:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
it's only i can only if i fill them up
 
05:44:20.868 --> 05:44:20.878 align:start position:0%
and dump it's only
 
05:44:23.190 --> 05:44:23.200 align:start position:0%
14 gallons per minute that's most i can
 
05:44:25.910 --> 05:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
possibly do or possibly push out i mean
 
05:44:27.430 --> 05:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
what a lot of people are not taking into
 
05:44:28.948 --> 05:44:28.958 align:start position:0%
consideration is
 
05:44:30.948 --> 05:44:30.958 align:start position:0%
some industrial fry leaders they have
 
05:44:33.750 --> 05:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
they self-clean excuse me
 
05:44:35.110 --> 05:44:35.120 align:start position:0%
this is where i'm getting confused when
 
05:44:36.948 --> 05:44:36.958 align:start position:0%
you start talking about flow rates a
 
05:44:39.990 --> 05:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
flow that's not happening
 
05:44:42.548 --> 05:44:42.558 align:start position:0%
yeah gallons per minute yes but i mean
 
05:44:44.628 --> 05:44:44.638 align:start position:0%
it made it sound as if it's not going
 
05:44:46.390 --> 05:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
into the system at all
 
05:44:48.310 --> 05:44:48.320 align:start position:0%
no the gate no it's a that's
 
05:44:49.750 --> 05:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
at one point you alluded to maybe you're
 
05:44:52.390 --> 05:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
using it to enhance your firewoods well
 
05:44:54.788 --> 05:44:54.798 align:start position:0%
no i mean you have you have the oil and
 
05:44:56.708 --> 05:44:56.718 align:start position:0%
what you do i have my fryer latest my
 
05:44:58.948 --> 05:44:58.958 align:start position:0%
friday is a bench top okay they're
 
05:45:01.510 --> 05:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
self-contained they they only your real
 
05:45:04.150 --> 05:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
industrial ones actually self-clean and
 
05:45:06.470 --> 05:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
self-pump mine only don't do one my
 
05:45:08.628 --> 05:45:08.638 align:start position:0%
basket does one serving at a time
 
05:45:10.390 --> 05:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
that's it i have three of them three
 
05:45:12.948 --> 05:45:12.958 align:start position:0%
table tops the only about this big does
 
05:45:15.270 --> 05:45:15.280 align:start position:0%
one's one serving of french fries like a
 
05:45:17.270 --> 05:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
mcdonald's french fry bag lodge one
 
05:45:18.628 --> 05:45:18.638 align:start position:0%
serving that's it
 
05:45:21.670 --> 05:45:21.680 align:start position:0%
and that's you you reuse your your oil
 
05:45:23.350 --> 05:45:23.360 align:start position:0%
over and over again and when it gets
 
05:45:25.430 --> 05:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
when it gets old i actually hand screen
 
05:45:27.190 --> 05:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
it and put it back in and when it gets
 
05:45:29.590 --> 05:45:29.600 align:start position:0%
too wall i put it in the container and i
 
05:45:31.030 --> 05:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
bring it right down the street we're a
 
05:45:33.190 --> 05:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
person that recycles it
 
05:45:35.590 --> 05:45:35.600 align:start position:0%
so that never touches the
 
05:45:37.270 --> 05:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
sink that would be insane to pour it
 
05:45:38.548 --> 05:45:38.558 align:start position:0%
down the sink
 
05:45:41.270 --> 05:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:44.070 --> 05:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
representative goalie
 
05:45:45.990 --> 05:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
05:45:48.310 --> 05:45:48.320 align:start position:0%
coming here to testify
 
05:45:50.310 --> 05:45:50.320 align:start position:0%
how long have you had this installed now
 
05:45:52.310 --> 05:45:52.320 align:start position:0%
i know probably as this year that was
 
05:45:52.320 --> 05:45:53.270 align:start position:0%
i know probably as this year that was
installed

05:45:53.270 --> 05:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
installed
 
05:45:57.430 --> 05:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
yes well we got this installed in
 
05:45:57.440 --> 05:45:59.670 align:start position:0%
yes well we got this installed in
september

05:45:59.670 --> 05:45:59.680 align:start position:0%
september
 
05:46:01.750 --> 05:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
and since september
 
05:46:03.350 --> 05:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
have you looked at all to see how much
 
05:46:04.948 --> 05:46:04.958 align:start position:0%
grease you've actually collected in that
 
05:46:06.708 --> 05:46:06.718 align:start position:0%
short time frame yeah i have a lot of
 
05:46:08.628 --> 05:46:08.638 align:start position:0%
grey water in there
 
05:46:12.788 --> 05:46:12.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:14.548 --> 05:46:14.558 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions from any
 
05:46:16.708 --> 05:46:16.718 align:start position:0%
of the members
 
05:46:20.628 --> 05:46:20.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:22.948 --> 05:46:22.958 align:start position:0%
so when you originally started your
 
05:46:22.958 --> 05:46:24.788 align:start position:0%
so when you originally started your
restaurant

05:46:24.788 --> 05:46:24.798 align:start position:0%
restaurant
 
05:46:26.390 --> 05:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
was it
 
05:46:29.910 --> 05:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
primarily an ice cream shop
 
05:46:32.150 --> 05:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
or did it always have ice cream and a
 
05:46:33.430 --> 05:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
little bit of food
 
05:46:34.708 --> 05:46:34.718 align:start position:0%
always ice cream and a little bit of
 
05:46:36.310 --> 05:46:36.320 align:start position:0%
food that's why we put in that permit
 
05:46:38.868 --> 05:46:38.878 align:start position:0%
for uh for both
 
05:46:40.070 --> 05:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
05:46:42.708 --> 05:46:42.718 align:start position:0%
and when did you start expanding your
 
05:46:45.590 --> 05:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
restaurant to include
 
05:46:48.230 --> 05:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
more food
 
05:46:48.240 --> 05:46:50.948 align:start position:0%
more food
oh

05:46:50.948 --> 05:46:50.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:53.270 --> 05:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
uh our menus increased a little bit at a
 
05:46:55.830 --> 05:46:55.840 align:start position:0%
time with the same type of things since
 
05:46:57.590 --> 05:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
we we opened
 
05:46:59.510 --> 05:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
i mean you always increase a little bit
 
05:47:02.310 --> 05:47:02.320 align:start position:0%
but as far as what we had in there for
 
05:47:05.750 --> 05:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:07.990 --> 05:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
follow-up yeah so because i look at this
 
05:47:10.310 --> 05:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
menu and
 
05:47:12.628 --> 05:47:12.638 align:start position:0%
i'm not a restaurant person
 
05:47:14.548 --> 05:47:14.558 align:start position:0%
nor do i
 
05:47:16.708 --> 05:47:16.718 align:start position:0%
can conceive how i would go about doing
 
05:47:18.150 --> 05:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
all this but
 
05:47:20.948 --> 05:47:20.958 align:start position:0%
there seems to be
 
05:47:20.958 --> 05:47:23.190 align:start position:0%
there seems to be
a

05:47:23.190 --> 05:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:26.470 --> 05:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
like a 50 50 ratio of food to
 
05:47:29.030 --> 05:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
ice cream
 
05:47:31.510 --> 05:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
of offerings
 
05:47:32.868 --> 05:47:32.878 align:start position:0%
you can't see this
 
05:47:34.628 --> 05:47:34.638 align:start position:0%
the board goes further with more ice
 
05:47:38.628 --> 05:47:38.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:38.638 --> 05:47:41.270 align:start position:0%
 
right

05:47:41.270 --> 05:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:44.390 --> 05:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:45.590 --> 05:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
if you
 
05:47:47.590 --> 05:47:47.600 align:start position:0%
for example
 
05:47:49.430 --> 05:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
the fryers are one thing but wouldn't
 
05:47:51.270 --> 05:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
there also be
 
05:47:56.400 --> 05:47:56.410 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:56.410 --> 05:48:08.070 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

05:48:08.070 --> 05:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:10.230 --> 05:48:10.240 align:start position:0%
don't you clean all the
 
05:48:12.070 --> 05:48:12.080 align:start position:0%
well actually they that we do but they
 
05:48:14.150 --> 05:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
also make inserts for the shaping dishes
 
05:48:16.390 --> 05:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
which are plastic inserts where you pour
 
05:48:18.070 --> 05:48:18.080 align:start position:0%
in because who wants to be washing them
 
05:48:20.070 --> 05:48:20.080 align:start position:0%
all the time and you pull the plastic
 
05:48:21.190 --> 05:48:21.200 align:start position:0%
piece out
 
05:48:23.750 --> 05:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
so yeah there's very to little none i
 
05:48:25.510 --> 05:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
mean today's modern kitchen there's very
 
05:48:27.270 --> 05:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
little cleaning there's a lot of things
 
05:48:29.030 --> 05:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
you can cook in but the chaff and dish
 
05:48:31.030 --> 05:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
is what we put our things in uh like the
 
05:48:33.030 --> 05:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
cheese and whatever we use out there
 
05:48:34.708 --> 05:48:34.718 align:start position:0%
yeah it goes into a it goes into a
 
05:48:37.190 --> 05:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
plastic container in the chaff and dish
 
05:48:39.190 --> 05:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
itself the liner and then you pour in it
 
05:48:40.470 --> 05:48:40.480 align:start position:0%
you can look them up they're very cheap
 
05:48:45.430 --> 05:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:47.750 --> 05:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
okay are there any further
 
05:48:51.110 --> 05:48:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:53.030 --> 05:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
i i have a little bit we're also
 
05:48:55.190 --> 05:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
representing uh the bed and breakfast we
 
05:48:56.788 --> 05:48:56.798 align:start position:0%
have we have a place up the street which
 
05:48:59.670 --> 05:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
is an end they have a 750 gallon grease
 
05:49:01.830 --> 05:49:01.840 align:start position:0%
trap that's already installed and they

05:49:07.590 --> 05:49:07.600 align:start position:0%

serve the public
 
05:49:13.030 --> 05:49:13.040 align:start position:0%

05:49:18.070 --> 05:49:18.080 align:start position:0%

don't want you folks to lose sight of
 
05:49:54.708 --> 05:49:54.718 align:start position:0%
the issue of the ipc
 
05:49:56.708 --> 05:49:56.718 align:start position:0%
in the drinking water side i know this
 
05:49:59.110 --> 05:49:59.120 align:start position:0%
conversation has been
 
05:50:01.830 --> 05:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
primarily focused on wastewater but we
 
05:50:03.590 --> 05:50:03.600 align:start position:0%
have some real concerns about the
 
05:50:05.990 --> 05:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
misinterpretation of the ipc code with
 
05:50:07.750 --> 05:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
backflow prevention
 
05:50:10.070 --> 05:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
and water systems that's a really
 
05:50:12.390 --> 05:50:12.400 align:start position:0%
important issue for us
 
05:50:15.510 --> 05:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
that is a big big concern
 
05:50:17.910 --> 05:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
because it could put thousands of people
 
05:50:22.948 --> 05:50:22.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:26.628 --> 05:50:26.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:28.390 --> 05:50:28.400 align:start position:0%
