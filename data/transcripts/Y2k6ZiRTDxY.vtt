00:07:41.589 --> 00:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:42.840 align:start position:0%
on this
 
00:07:44.869 --> 00:07:44.879 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:07:44.879 --> 00:07:45.909 align:start position:0%
so um
we

00:07:45.909 --> 00:07:45.919 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:48.800 align:start position:0%
that was the focus of additional
 
00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.309 align:start position:0%
that was the focus of additional
legislation

00:07:50.309 --> 00:07:50.319 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:52.240 align:start position:0%
so that's um
 
00:07:54.629 --> 00:07:54.639 align:start position:0%
i think that's kind of where we left
 
00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
that and
 
00:07:58.629 --> 00:07:58.639 align:start position:0%
all of us were in agreement
 
00:08:00.629 --> 00:08:00.639 align:start position:0%
that that's what we should do on that
 
00:08:00.639 --> 00:08:01.670 align:start position:0%
that that's what we should do on that
bill

the next bill is um house bill 1300
 
00:11:05.829 --> 00:11:05.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:09.509 --> 00:11:09.519 align:start position:0%
this is dealing with the ash landfill
 
00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
they had come in and asked for i believe
 
00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
five hundred thousand dollars
 
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
five yeah five hundred thousand dollars
 
00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
charge them
 
00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
on the landfill
 
00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
and uh for
 
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
making sure that
 
00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
nothing happened to the landfill over
 
00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:41.200 align:start position:0%
the course of the next 50 years
 
00:11:45.509 --> 00:11:45.519 align:start position:0%
and of the uh ash landfill is kind of a
 
00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
unique situation in that it was
 
00:11:54.069 --> 00:11:54.079 align:start position:0%
taken over by a non-profit
 
00:11:57.990 --> 00:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
and obviously the non-profit
 
00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.269 align:start position:0%
and obviously the non-profit
had

00:11:59.269 --> 00:11:59.279 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:12:01.829 --> 00:12:01.839 align:start position:0%
collected money from the towns that had
 
00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
been using the landfill
 
00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
so that they could
 
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:08.720 align:start position:0%
manage the landfill for some number of
 
00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:09.509 align:start position:0%
manage the landfill for some number of
years

00:12:09.509 --> 00:12:09.519 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
25 maybe
 
00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:14.150 align:start position:0%
25 maybe
and

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:12:16.629 --> 00:12:16.639 align:start position:0%
they had thought that that agreement
 
00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
which des had approved
 
00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
20 years ago probably
 
00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
that that once
 
00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
this thing ran out once the the the
 
00:12:35.269 --> 00:12:35.279 align:start position:0%
25 years
 
00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:38.560 align:start position:0%
program 30 years program whatever it was
 
00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
anyhow that that would take care of
 
00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:42.230 align:start position:0%
anyhow that that would take care of
everything

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:42.240 align:start position:0%
everything
 
00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:43.990 align:start position:0%
everything
so

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
got together and came up with a solution
 
00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
that was not going to
 
00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
cost any
 
00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
additional dollars i believe that the
 
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:04.160 align:start position:0%
letter from des was
 
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
sent to everyone
 
00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:08.240 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
as far as i know everybody is happy
 
00:13:15.509 --> 00:13:15.519 align:start position:0%
so we are not recommending any further
 
00:13:15.519 --> 00:13:16.870 align:start position:0%
so we are not recommending any further
legislation

00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:13:21.269 --> 00:13:21.279 align:start position:0%
on this particular bill
 
00:13:21.279 --> 00:13:22.230 align:start position:0%
on this particular bill

action
 
00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
uh we determined
 
00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:16:35.749 --> 00:16:35.759 align:start position:0%
there would be no
 
00:16:35.759 --> 00:16:36.389 align:start position:0%
there would be no
we

00:16:36.389 --> 00:16:36.399 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:16:39.829 --> 00:16:39.839 align:start position:0%
we recommended that there would be uh
 
00:16:41.269 --> 00:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
no further
 
00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
uh legislative action
 
00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh taken on
 
00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:50.629 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:16:50.629 --> 00:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
that's kind of where we left it and we
 
00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:56.720 align:start position:0%
recognize that um
 
00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:17:00.069 --> 00:17:00.079 align:start position:0%
some towns have been overwhelmed if
 
00:17:01.749 --> 00:17:01.759 align:start position:0%
that's the right term
 
00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
with costs and but
 
00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
we thought that what we had done
 
00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:08.549 align:start position:0%
we thought that what we had done
legislatively

00:17:08.549 --> 00:17:08.559 align:start position:0%
legislatively
 
00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:12.079 align:start position:0%
would help to mitigate the problems
 
00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:13.829 align:start position:0%
would help to mitigate the problems
so

00:17:13.829 --> 00:17:13.839 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:26.640 align:start position:0%

00:21:06.149 --> 00:21:06.159 align:start position:0%
think my vehicle is falling apart
 
00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
to say the least but i'm going to be
 
00:21:10.549 --> 00:21:10.559 align:start position:0%
running for county commissioner
 
00:21:12.789 --> 00:21:12.799 align:start position:0%

00:21:21.029 --> 00:21:21.039 align:start position:0%
in coast county
 
00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
