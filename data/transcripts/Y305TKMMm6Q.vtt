1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Thank you.

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Thank you.

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Thank you.

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Thank you.

5
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:26.500
you all right good morning everybody welcome to eda day we have two non-germain amendments to our Senate bills that are some of the issues we've been working on all spring, and Representative Broda will introduce them.

6
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.500
Melissa, first one.

7
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.000
Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.

8
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I'm introducing an amendment, non-jermaine amendment to Senate Bill 207.

9
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.500
And it is to provide conditional licensure for mental health professionals.

10
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:48.500
And this originally was called House Bill 428 and we retained it in committee.

11
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:59.000
And I'm hoping that we could take a look at it and discuss it and attach it to Senate Bill 207.

12
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:11.500
It came out of the work committee that we had over the summer to remove the hurdles for the mental health professionals in New Hampshire.

13
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.500
Okay.

14
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.000
So we have conditional licenses.

15
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And perhaps...

16
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.500
Did this come out of...

17
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:28.500
Was this in House Bill 2, and did we take it out of House Bill 2?

18
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.500
No.

19
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.500
I don't believe so.

20
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.500
Did we?

21
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.500
I don't think so.

22
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.500
Okay.

23
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.500
Thank you.

24
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.500
This is for just...

25
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.500
This is something...

26
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:51.500
I don't believe we have a statute that deals with applications for conditional licensure.

27
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.500
Ah, so this is new law.

28
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.500
Yes, exactly.

29
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.500
Okay.

30
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.500
Thank you.

31
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.000
Are there any questions from the committee?

32
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
All right.

33
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Thank you very much representative thank you all right I don't have any card so is there anyone else who wishes to testify on this amendment good morning good morning uh representative i have a pin card i can give you um for the record lindsay courtney executive director office of professional licensure and certification um oklc is here to testify in support of Amendment 1915H.

34
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:56.500
Essentially, several years ago, we had added conditional licensure for certain license types under the Board of Mental Health Practice, but we did not include all license types under the Board of Mental Health Practice.

35
00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:48.000
Historically, what they've done is they've had approved supervisory agreements and then they have been allowed to practice under supervision without seeking licensure this would allow them to obtain a conditional license under the same parameters but i think it would essentially provide a mechanism to bill and receive reimbursement for services, which is the direction this state is going it's also consistent with what we see in other states and it's consistent with the compacts that are starting to come out which require um certain categories for licensure with that i'd be happy to answer any questions but but it's pretty straightforward.

36
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Okay.

37
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.500
Are there any questions from the committee?

38
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.500
Representative Fitzpatrick?

39
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.500
Hello.

40
00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.500
Representative Perota.

41
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.000
I have a comment, if I may.

42
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:17.000
One of the reasons why the committee had retained the bill was because we were looking at House Bill 655 and the merger of the mental health boards.

43
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:27.500
And until we had addressed that, we didn't want to add any more requirements or definitions to the mental health professions.

44
00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:34.500
But I do think that at this point, we are ready to do that.

45
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.500
Okay.

46
00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.500
Anyone else?

47
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.500
All right, Thank you very much.

48
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:49.000
Is there anyone else who wishes to testify on this amendment to Senate Bill 207?

49
00:04:49.000 --> 00:05:09.500
okay in that case i'll close the public hearing and we will result we will chatter and lobby until 11 o'clock when our next hearing begins what i thought so too but let's a Matt and Jason can't be here today.

50
00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.500
So she's got work, I think.

51
00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.500
She had work.

52
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:21.500
So I don't know where everybody else is either, but I'm this this one.

53
00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.500
Thank you.

54
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.500

Thank you.

91
00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.500
Thank you.

92
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.500
Thank you.

93
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.500
Thank you.

94
00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.500
Thank you.

95
00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:47.500
Thank you.

96
00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.500
Thank you.

97
00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.500
Thank you.

98
00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.500
Thank you.

99
00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.500
Thank you.

100
00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.500
Thank you.

101
00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.500
Thank you.

102
00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.500
Thank you.

103
00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.500
Thank you.

104
00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.500
Thank you.

105
00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:07.500
Thank you.

106
00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.500
Thank you.

107
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.500
Thank you, Madam Chair.

108
00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:18.000
Amendment number 2023-1943 is something that might look familiar to some of you.

109
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:28.500
Some of it is from the original House Bill 655, which was heard in this committee, and deals with four things.

110
00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:35.000
One is the repealing of the disciplinary proceedings from the boards and investigations.

111
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:44.500
You might remember that the discussion that we had had as a committee was to separate investigation from adjudication.

112
00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:49.000
So, investigations is going to be conducted by OPLC.

113
00:07:49.000 --> 00:08:02.500
The other part of the amendment addresses non-public members because not all of the statutes made it clear that non-public members had to be independent from the...

114
00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:05.500
Excuse me, you mean public members?

115
00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.500
I mean public members.

116
00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:09.500
I'm so sorry.

117
00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:11.500
That's no problem.

118
00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:13.500
Public members.

119
00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:15.500
Thank you.

120
00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:21.000
So those public members have to be independent from the board.

121
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:27.000
The other refers to what used to be the Medical Review Subcommittee.

122
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Lastly, it talks about the requirements of being a board member and what the reasons would be to be removed from a board and this amendment was drafted by attorney Osterhout from OPLC, and he's here to answer any questions that you might have.

123
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Okay.

124
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.500
Are there any questions from the committee?

125
00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.500
Representative True, thank you.

126
00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:58.500
Thank you, Madam Chair.

127
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.500
I apologize.

128
00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:03.500
You listed four things it's doing.

129
00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:05.500
What was the third?

130
00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:12.000
The Medical Review Subcommittee, which was eliminated but is redefined in this amendment.

131
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Thank you.

132
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.500
Review Subcommittee, which was eliminated but is redefined in this amendment.

133
00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:26.500
Yes, the Medical Review Subcommittee is on page 10, the bottom of page 10.

134
00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.500
Okay.

135
00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.500
Okay.

136
00:09:30.500 --> 00:10:20.000
and I see that you've got a contingent effectivity so that this applies after House Bill 655 passes thank you that makes it easier I'm going to go, and Jackie can correct me if I'm wrong, the members appointed by the medical board and so there's some concern I had some concern of having the same people doing the investigation who would then basically adjudicate it and if you look at page 10 starting at line 32 it, the committee appointments shall be made by the executive director of OPLC in accordance with the criteria established by the board.

137
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:34.000
So the board can say what kind of people they need, what kind of expertise, but they don't actually appoint the individuals to deal with that potential issue.

138
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Okay.

139
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:55.500
On the public members, did you get the entire Board of mental health practice I there's the pharmacy board and the midwifery council okay I'm not sure everyone was able to hear what I said but Douglas Osterhhout, OPLC.

140
00:10:55.500 --> 00:11:01.500
I went through every single board under the OPLC for this project.

141
00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:03.500
Okay, thank you.

142
00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:05.500
That's important.

143
00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:14.000
Yeah, I was shocked when I was told that one member was the spouse of another member.

144
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:22.000
And that appears to a lot of people that looks like that's a conflict of interest.

145
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
All right, any other questions, comments?

146
00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.500
All right, well, thank you very much.

147
00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:48.500
Is there anyone else who wishes to testify on this amendment all right seeing none i will close the public hearing we will be voting on these bills on wednesday and these amendments will be part of the executive session.

148
00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:51.500
Okay, thank you all for coming.

149
00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:53.500
Thank you.

150
00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:55.500
Thank you.
