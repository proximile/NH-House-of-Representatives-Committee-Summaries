00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
okay let's open up the
 
00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 align:start position:0%
subcommittees first up
 
00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 align:start position:0%
um so Mark we we
 
00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 align:start position:0%
have the uh these checks that were sent
 
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 align:start position:0%
out um need to say I was kind of shocked
 
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
to see a check that's
 
00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 align:start position:0%
$5,000 uh the the first question I would
 
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 align:start position:0%
be posing on terms of this 5,000 deck um
 
00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 align:start position:0%
it turns out that
 
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
some uh
 
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
some insurance companies and Anthem
 
00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 align:start position:0%
might be one of them actually does pay
 
00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 align:start position:0%
the balance
 
00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:28.599 align:start position:0%
billing so in terms of the way you read
 
00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 align:start position:0%
the statute the right now do you see
 
00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 align:start position:0%
that is that is means any check that
 
00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 align:start position:0%
insurance company sends to the customer
 
00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 align:start position:0%
to the patient regardless of whether
 
00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
it's balance billing or not is that what
 
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
you're looking
 
00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
at because that was never the intent of
 
00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 align:start position:0%
legislation was always it was in my mind
 
00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 align:start position:0%
in my memory was always just what the
 
00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 align:start position:0%
reimbursement uh for the
 
00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 align:start position:0%
uh whether ambulances in network or not
 
00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 align:start position:0%
and that the ambulance company uh excuse
 
00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 align:start position:0%
me the insurance company would send the
 
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 align:start position:0%
ambulance company the check and if and
 
00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 align:start position:0%
and obviously they were that my
 
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
understood was that they were sending
 
00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 align:start position:0%
the check to the patient if the
 
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 align:start position:0%
ambulance company was out of
 
00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
network okay so the question is if all
 
00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 align:start position:0%
we did is
 
00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
say assum assuming that it's
 
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 align:start position:0%
only the reimburse for the ambulance and
 
00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
billing okay because evidently some
 
00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 align:start position:0%
insurance companies pay the balance
 
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 align:start position:0%
billing and some do
 
00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
not and you point out MVP and by the way
 
00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 align:start position:0%
ago right so if if the if the if the
 
00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
issue if we were going to narrow down
 
00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
the issue is it's only the only check
 
00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 align:start position:0%
that that we're focusing in is we're not
 
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 align:start position:0%
focusing on the balance billing check
 
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 align:start position:0%
we're focusing on just the check the
 
00:04:12.429 --> 00:04:12.439 align:start position:0%
insurance company is reimbursing the
 
00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:13.710 align:start position:0%
insurance company is reimbursing the
patient

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 align:start position:0%
patient
 
00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 align:start position:0%
with then that would be a reasonable I
 
00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.830 align:start position:0%
with then that would be a reasonable I
guess

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 align:start position:0%
compromise right the bill well at least
 
00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 align:start position:0%
that's what we think it is but but I I
 
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.590 align:start position:0%
that's what we think it is but but I I
think

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:37.830 align:start position:0%
 
when

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:40.639 align:start position:0%
it's covering the charge of the
 
00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:43.039 align:start position:0%
bill should come to
 
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
us right but we we know that when it
 
00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.350 align:start position:0%
us right but we we know that when it
comes

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 align:start position:0%
comes
 
00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 align:start position:0%
to all other health insurance costs when
 
00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 align:start position:0%
they send a check they're there to the
 
00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:58.039 align:start position:0%
provider that's based on the contracted
 
00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:01.479 align:start position:0%
price it's negot it's not the full
 
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 align:start position:0%
price so that to to keep it Apples to
 
00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
Apples then as long as if we write the
 
00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 align:start position:0%
legislation to say is what the
 
00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
reimbursement but
 
00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:17.479 align:start position:0%
not the balance billing no the balance
 
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
billing you still have to collect from
 
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:24.230 align:start position:0%
billing you still have to collect from
the

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 align:start position:0%
patient we want you to join the network
 
00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:30.039 align:start position:0%
and evidently for Anthem there is a huge
 
00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:32.639 align:start position:0%
chunk of there's 100 people 100
 
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
different ambulances that are in
 
00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 align:start position:0%
network so that that's not a problem
 
00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:49.400 align:start position:0%
than join because we don't them because
 
00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.469 align:start position:0%
than join because we don't them because
we

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:51.479 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
reimb service right I understand so so
 
00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:56.919 align:start position:0%
basically what we're doing is we want to
 
00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
raise everybody's premiums in the small
 
00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:00.670 align:start position:0%
raise everybody's premiums in the small
group

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:00.680 align:start position:0%
group
 
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
market so that that ambulances get to be
 
00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:05.639 align:start position:0%
one thing that nobody else no other
 
00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
healthc care provider gets no hospital
 
00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:11.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:14.680 align:start position:0%
amount is that is that fair so if I
 
00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:16.479 align:start position:0%
understand it ambulance billing is like
 
00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:21.199 align:start position:0%
1% of their their total output
 
00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:26.800 align:start position:0%
1% 35% sorry of their whole outlook so
 
00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
us getting the full check to keep a
 
00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:33.039 align:start position:0%
solvent isn't going to break
 
00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
them I don't see that at all well I I
 
00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:37.720 align:start position:0%
would have a problem with that no I'm
 
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:39.240 align:start position:0%
sorry that that that is throwing the
 
00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:40.639 align:start position:0%
whole Managed Care the whole
 
00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
reimbursement system in the trash can we
 
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
cannot do that or you can pay Paul
 
00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
because what we need to make up in the
 
00:06:49.749 --> 00:06:49.759 align:start position:0%
emergency service is going to go to your
 
00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:52.520 align:start position:0%
taxpayer right community so so now
 
00:06:55.629 --> 00:06:55.639 align:start position:0%
you're spreading that one person's bill
 
00:06:58.629 --> 00:06:58.639 align:start position:0%
over the town right not just on that one
 
00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:01.960 align:start position:0%
person but let's think about this for a
 
00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
second what would then stop all the
 
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
other providers all the other healthc
 
00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:08.360 align:start position:0%
care all the other hospitals and doctors
 
00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:10.360 align:start position:0%
and all them to come in and say well gee
 
00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
you gave it to the ambulances why can't
 
00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:14.680 align:start position:0%
you give that to us too we don't want to
 
00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.589 align:start position:0%
you give that to us too we don't want to
open

00:07:17.589 --> 00:07:17.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
247 no matter what they are not they
 
00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:24.280 align:start position:0%
have patients lined up they schedule
 
00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:27.720 align:start position:0%
accordingly they don't wait for calls
 
00:07:30.469 --> 00:07:30.479 align:start position:0%
they don't wait for patients
 
00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:32.280 align:start position:0%
well emergency rooms
 
00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
do emergency rooms do not wait for
 
00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
patients there's LS out the door no no
 
00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:40.520 align:start position:0%
there's plenty of plenty of emergency
 
00:07:41.909 --> 00:07:41.919 align:start position:0%
rooms that are sitting there waiting for
 
00:07:44.589 --> 00:07:44.599 align:start position:0%
people yes okay but that's the model I
 
00:07:46.029 --> 00:07:46.039 align:start position:0%
mean again we're talking about the
 
00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:48.800 align:start position:0%
business model okay and you're asking
 
00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:51.800 align:start position:0%
for something as a special privilege to
 
00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
say well ambulance compan so we can just
 
00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:55.240 align:start position:0%
you know some of them are talents but
 
00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:56.360 align:start position:0%
some of them are not some of them are
 
00:07:58.950 --> 00:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
private businessmen okay not many well
 
00:07:58.960 --> 00:07:59.950 align:start position:0%
private businessmen okay not many well
anyway

00:07:59.950 --> 00:07:59.960 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
okay the issue of saying is we're going
 
00:08:06.909 --> 00:08:06.919 align:start position:0%
to the issue I always thought was the
 
00:08:09.309 --> 00:08:09.319 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rate from the insurance
 
00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
company for the ambulance so the n n in
 
00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:17.240 align:start position:0%
network no well let me just say what way
 
00:08:20.189 --> 00:08:20.199 align:start position:0%
I did understand that there was always
 
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
two different amounts that if you were
 
00:08:26.189 --> 00:08:26.199 align:start position:0%
in network you got a bigger check if
 
00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
you're out of
 
00:08:30.749 --> 00:08:30.759 align:start position:0%
network okay do we agree on that and
 
00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:33.560 align:start position:0%
that's fair okay that if you sign a
 
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
contract you're going to get
 
00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:38.800 align:start position:0%
more right so that you're okay with that
 
00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
right no you're not even okay with that
 
00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:42.919 align:start position:0%
either so you're basically saying you
 
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
don't even want him to sign a contract
 
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
you saying they're gonna if I submit the
 
00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:48.640 align:start position:0%
bill and I'm in network they're going to
 
00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:51.200 align:start position:0%
pay me the whole bill nope they're not
 
00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:52.640 align:start position:0%
right so it's they don't pay anybody the
 
00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:54.920 align:start position:0%
whole bill they don't pay any other
 
00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
profession nobody not even Pharmacy not
 
00:08:59.670 --> 00:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
even doctors not even hospitals nobody
 
00:09:00.949 --> 00:09:00.959 align:start position:0%
gets the full
 
00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:07.509 --> 00:09:07.519 align:start position:0%
us okay representative
 
00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:09.240 align:start position:0%
collabor I
 
00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:12.120 align:start position:0%
think the quibble here seems to be about
 
00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
the legislation to write something that
 
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:15.760 align:start position:0%
has been taking place for a very long
 
00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:17.160 align:start position:0%
time and that is that the fees for
 
00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
served are not
 
00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:20.800 align:start position:0%
sufficient we're assuming that this
 
00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:22.760 align:start position:0%
status quo is the model you want to
 
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:24.760 align:start position:0%
continue and what these towns and
 
00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities are trying to say and
 
00:09:27.829 --> 00:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
I've been a part of their volunteer
 
00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
Ambulance Service in the past
 
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:32.440 align:start position:0%
is that they won't stay solvent with
 
00:09:34.069 --> 00:09:34.079 align:start position:0%
these fees for service the way they are
 
00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:36.800 align:start position:0%
and they're begging for our support
 
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:39.160 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm trying to say somebody
 
00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:40.760 align:start position:0%
is going to have to cover it at some
 
00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:43.240 align:start position:0%
point and if the onus becomes these
 
00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities the wait times are going
 
00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
to be longer for and lives will be lost
 
00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:50.920 align:start position:0%
volunteers will not step
 
00:09:54.269 --> 00:09:54.279 align:start position:0%
up that's all I'm trying to say so it
 
00:09:57.509 --> 00:09:57.519 align:start position:0%
doesn't bother you that
 
00:09:59.670 --> 00:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
um private insurance insurance company
 
00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:01.720 align:start position:0%
is only
 
00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:04.680 align:start position:0%
20% the rest of it is
 
00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:09.560 align:start position:0%
orisas small B large businesses Medicare
 
00:10:11.949 --> 00:10:11.959 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and you doesn't bother you that
 
00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:15.240 align:start position:0%
we can't force them to pay more you just
 
00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:17.720 align:start position:0%
want to go after the small businessman
 
00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:19.320 align:start position:0%
the small businesses you just think that
 
00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:20.720 align:start position:0%
they're the ones what are you talking
 
00:10:23.389 --> 00:10:23.399 align:start position:0%
small businesses okay what this this
 
00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:28.040 align:start position:0%
legislation affects is only small
 
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
employers and individuals what ambulance
 
00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:35.320 align:start position:0%
and the ambulance mandate okay we have
 
00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
no legislative control I know we haven't
 
00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
really talked about this over the years
 
00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:42.720 align:start position:0%
you know usually the old days we used to
 
00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:45.200 align:start position:0%
uh go go through this issue all the time
 
00:10:46.389 --> 00:10:46.399 align:start position:0%
because we used to get a lot of health
 
00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:48.200 align:start position:0%
insurance mandates we haven't gotten
 
00:10:50.069 --> 00:10:50.079 align:start position:0%
them so much uh because of the
 
00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
Affordable Care Act saying that if we
 
00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:54.680 align:start position:0%
were to pass a new mandate the cost
 
00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:57.200 align:start position:0%
would then have to be passed on uh to
 
00:10:59.389 --> 00:10:59.399 align:start position:0%
the state okay so that's why we have not
 
00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:01.320 align:start position:0%
had this conversation but if you were to
 
00:11:04.509 --> 00:11:04.519 align:start position:0%
take all the people who are insured out
 
00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
there okay you say 100% of the
 
00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:10.240 align:start position:0%
population obviously there some are
 
00:11:12.949 --> 00:11:12.959 align:start position:0%
uninsured so we're taking that off but
 
00:11:17.509 --> 00:11:17.519 align:start position:0%
we have the number one employer based
 
00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:20.680 align:start position:0%
health insurance plans are called
 
00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:23.800 align:start position:0%
arises which is a created back uh Gerald
 
00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
Ford was president and it's an
 
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
employer-based health insurance plan
 
00:11:32.069 --> 00:11:32.079 align:start position:0%
otherwise it's known as
 
00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
self-insured okay um and and the state
 
00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:37.160 align:start position:0%
is in a Risa
 
00:11:40.069 --> 00:11:40.079 align:start position:0%
plan some of our my coun is are Rises I
 
00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
don't know you know but a lot of large
 
00:11:44.829 --> 00:11:44.839 align:start position:0%
employers are Rises so this legislation
 
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
does not affect
 
00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
them they're outside of this
 
00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:52.680 align:start position:0%
legislation this legislation affects a
 
00:11:54.949 --> 00:11:54.959 align:start position:0%
very Nar narrow
 
00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:01.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:02.200 align:start position:0%
50 or
 
00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:05.480 align:start position:0%
less so the question is do you want to
 
00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:08.440 align:start position:0%
make them pay the full amount while
 
00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
everybody else will pay what they feel
 
00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:12.680 align:start position:0%
like paying no I want the insurance
 
00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
companies to do the right thing by
 
00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:17.480 align:start position:0%
everybody this is I we we can't do
 
00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:20.720 align:start position:0%
anything about that okay so I was just
 
00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
saying is that if if we want to get to
 
00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:27.320 align:start position:0%
the question is that yes it is true we
 
00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
have this cost differ ual about which
 
00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
which ambulance companies sign a
 
00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:35.320 align:start position:0%
contract or don't sign a contract that
 
00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
there are reimbursement levels different
 
00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:39.800 align:start position:0%
if we want to write this legislation
 
00:12:41.509 --> 00:12:41.519 align:start position:0%
which I always thought this is what the
 
00:12:44.629 --> 00:12:44.639 align:start position:0%
issue was about okay so this is news to
 
00:12:47.189 --> 00:12:47.199 align:start position:0%
me that I just decid you know asked this
 
00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
question that they're now asking for the
 
00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
balance billing payments if the
 
00:12:55.509 --> 00:12:55.519 align:start position:0%
insurance company was generous enough to
 
00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
pay that because not all all companies
 
00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:01.720 align:start position:0%
not all companies pay the balance
 
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:04.720 align:start position:0%
billing okay so if the insurance company
 
00:13:07.069 --> 00:13:07.079 align:start position:0%
is willing to pay the balance billing
 
00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:10.120 align:start position:0%
should they also be sending that check
 
00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
to the ambulance company or sending it
 
00:13:15.189 --> 00:13:15.199 align:start position:0%
to the patient and have the patient send
 
00:13:18.269 --> 00:13:18.279 align:start position:0%
it because the ambulance company made
 
00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:22.040 align:start position:0%
the decision not to sign a
 
00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
contract does that make
 
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
sense okay go ahead
 
00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.590 align:start position:0%
sense okay go ahead
guys

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
guys
 
00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:30.760 align:start position:0%
thanks for the opportunity to speak
 
00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
Chris STW was from Hollis I'm a little
 
00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:35.800 align:start position:0%
confused that now as far as I'm aware
 
00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
this legislation only applies to direct
 
00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:39.720 align:start position:0%
payments that are currently going to
 
00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
patients doesn't include balance billing
 
00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:43.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't include any of those other
 
00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:47.480 align:start position:0%
things all we are asking to do is to
 
00:13:48.949 --> 00:13:48.959 align:start position:0%
take the name of the patient off the
 
00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:50.680 align:start position:0%
check and put the name of the ambulance
 
00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:52.120 align:start position:0%
company that provided the service on the
 
00:13:54.189 --> 00:13:54.199 align:start position:0%
check and mail it to them simple as that
 
00:13:55.949 --> 00:13:55.959 align:start position:0%
and you understand that that does not
 
00:13:57.749 --> 00:13:57.759 align:start position:0%
necessarily if the if the insurance
 
00:14:00.389 --> 00:14:00.399 align:start position:0%
company were to reimburse the patient
 
00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
for the balance
 
00:14:05.509 --> 00:14:05.519 align:start position:0%
billing you're not asking for that
 
00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:10.720 align:start position:0%
check no and what we're asking for is is
 
00:14:13.069 --> 00:14:13.079 align:start position:0%
budget neutral because they're already
 
00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
paying the amount I am I glad we got to
 
00:14:19.189 --> 00:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
this agreement I'm glad you came up here
 
00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
because I know Mark doesn't
 
00:14:23.829 --> 00:14:23.839 align:start position:0%
agree but at this point we are you and I
 
00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:25.480 align:start position:0%
are on the same page and and as
 
00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:27.880 align:start position:0%
representative cabal um Illustrated
 
00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:29.320 align:start position:0%
there are other things we need to work
 
00:14:31.749 --> 00:14:31.759 align:start position:0%
on in future legislation but as far as
 
00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:33.720 align:start position:0%
this goes right now we're just asking
 
00:14:35.509 --> 00:14:35.519 align:start position:0%
simply for direct pay for payments that
 
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
are already being made perfect all
 
00:14:41.829 --> 00:14:41.839 align:start position:0%
right you would can see me thank you and
 
00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
we still get the ability to balance bill
 
00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:45.160 align:start position:0%
for the rest correct they absolutely
 
00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:47.240 align:start position:0%
have the balance bill in L and we don't
 
00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:48.720 align:start position:0%
want to say that that insurance
 
00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
companies can't pay for it if they do
 
00:14:51.949 --> 00:14:51.959 align:start position:0%
want to pay for it that's out of the
 
00:14:54.269 --> 00:14:54.279 align:start position:0%
generosity of their own heart but that
 
00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
that's not what we're looking for in
 
00:14:58.629 --> 00:14:58.639 align:start position:0%
this particular legislation so if the
 
00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
insurance companies sending one check
 
00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:03.880 align:start position:0%
with with their name to the patient why
 
00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:05.480 align:start position:0%
don't we just whether it's the full
 
00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
amount or whatever direct pay whatever
 
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
you want to call it why isn't it coming
 
00:15:13.069 --> 00:15:13.079 align:start position:0%
to us I my guess is that this check was
 
00:15:14.629 --> 00:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
the full amount I mean I I don't know
 
00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe it wasn't but I guess this
 
00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:19.160 align:start position:0%
check was probably the full amount but
 
00:15:21.069 --> 00:15:21.079 align:start position:0%
at any rate if we can agree on what we
 
00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
need to legislate on then then we're
 
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
we're golden so now I'd like to have the
 
00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:30.910 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:32.629 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

00:15:32.629 --> 00:15:32.639 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:35.270 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:38.150 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:44.000 align:start position:0%

offline
 
00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:47.880 align:start position:0%
okay yeah you might want to press the
 
00:15:50.389 --> 00:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
button and introduce yourself not that
 
00:15:52.389 --> 00:15:52.399 align:start position:0%
almost everybody must know who you are
 
00:15:55.069 --> 00:15:55.079 align:start position:0%
now I'm here often enough uh good
 
00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:56.399 align:start position:0%

department joined this morning by my

colleague Michelle Heaton who is the

head legal beagle of our life and health
 
00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:09.800 align:start position:0%
unit wanted to just take a step back for
 
00:16:12.509 --> 00:16:12.519 align:start position:0%
a moment and provide a little bit of an
 
00:16:15.069 --> 00:16:15.079 align:start position:0%
update on an exercise that we went
 
00:16:17.069 --> 00:16:17.079 align:start position:0%
through as a department this summer in
 
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
Fall of which this particular piece of
 
00:16:22.269 --> 00:16:22.279 align:start position:0%
legislation was part of that that
 
00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:25.240 align:start position:0%
discussion so as you know a Prohibition
 
00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
against balance billing has been a
 
00:16:29.309 --> 00:16:29.319 align:start position:0%
position the insurance department has
 
00:16:32.389 --> 00:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
held for quite a long time uh we see it
 
00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:34.600 align:start position:0%
from a consumer protection uh
 
00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:37.240 align:start position:0%
perspective and and we think that what
 
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
happens to patients in these situations
 
00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
is is quite
 
00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
unfortunate but I've been coming to this
 
00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:44.240 align:start position:0%
committee making that argument and
 
00:16:46.269 --> 00:16:46.279 align:start position:0%
haven't gotten anywhere and neither had
 
00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
any of my predecessors so it wasn't
 
00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
anything exclusive to to
 
00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:55.000 align:start position:0%
me but this summer I then saw a story in
 
00:16:57.749 --> 00:16:57.759 align:start position:0%
the newspaper regarding uh some
 
00:16:59.829 --> 00:16:59.839 align:start position:0%
commercial ambulance providers who were
 
00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
going through major Financial struggles
 
00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:05.000 align:start position:0%
and I thought to myself maybe this is
 
00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:07.839 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for us to bring all of
 
00:17:10.549 --> 00:17:10.559 align:start position:0%
the stakeholders together and see if we
 
00:17:12.590 --> 00:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
can't come up with a solution that
 
00:17:14.309 --> 00:17:14.319 align:start position:0%
solves this issue from the perspective
 
00:17:16.189 --> 00:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
of the consumer from the perspective of
 
00:17:18.669 --> 00:17:18.679 align:start position:0%
the provider and the perspective of the
 
00:17:21.669 --> 00:17:21.679 align:start position:0%
carrier and so out of that came what I
 
00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:25.079 align:start position:0%
dubbed the ambulance Summit and as I
 
00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:26.839 align:start position:0%
said we met for a good portion of the
 
00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:28.760 align:start position:0%
summer in Fall we brought all of the
 
00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:31.320 align:start position:0%
stakeholders together and we learned a
 
00:17:33.909 --> 00:17:33.919 align:start position:0%
lot uh we learned a lot it was a good
 
00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
exercise although unfortunately we did
 
00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
not ultimately reach an agreement on
 
00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:41.960 align:start position:0%
what the best solution was but we did
 
00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:44.200 align:start position:0%
throw out some proposals we put out some
 
00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:46.600 align:start position:0%
potential Solutions it was part of a
 
00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
package of
 
00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
ideas one of those ideas Believe It or
 
00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
Not Mr chairman don't fall off your
 
00:17:53.789 --> 00:17:53.799 align:start position:0%
chair we suggested that perhaps a fee
 
00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
schedule was appropriate uh Mr
 
00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:57.720 align:start position:0%
Conservative here advocating for a fee
 
00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:00.280 align:start position:0%
schedule but the reality is the two
 
00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
sides are not negotiating and you're OB
 
00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:04.600 align:start position:0%
you're obviously hearing differing
 
00:18:06.909 --> 00:18:06.919 align:start position:0%
perspectives as to why that negotiation
 
00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
is not taking place so we said well
 
00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:11.400 align:start position:0%
let's do a fee schedule as a percentage
 
00:18:14.909 --> 00:18:14.919 align:start position:0%
of Medicaid Medicare Medicare excuse me
 
00:18:17.909 --> 00:18:17.919 align:start position:0%
do a Prohibition on balance billing and
 
00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
address this direct pay issue so that
 
00:18:21.669 --> 00:18:21.679 align:start position:0%
was one
 
00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:25.480 align:start position:0%
idea that did not get agreement so he
 
00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:27.880 align:start position:0%
said all right well we can do a minimum
 
00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
allowed Mount so set that floor for
 
00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:33.320 align:start position:0%
Rural and super rural which is where the
 
00:18:35.149 --> 00:18:35.159 align:start position:0%
providers particularly in the commercial
 
00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:38.120 align:start position:0%
space are really having trouble and
 
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
again we'll do the prohibition on
 
00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
balance billing and prohibition on
 
00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:45.640 align:start position:0%
direct pay that didn't go anywhere so we
 
00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:48.520 align:start position:0%
then suggested an IDR process with that
 
00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
floor again with the prohibition on
 
00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:54.720 align:start position:0%
balance billing and the direct pay issue
 
00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
the problem at the end of the day was
 
00:18:59.630 --> 00:18:59.640 align:start position:0%
there is a fissure in the interests
 
00:19:01.549 --> 00:19:01.559 align:start position:0%
between the commercial providers and the
 
00:19:04.149 --> 00:19:04.159 align:start position:0%
municipal providers in each and every
 
00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:06.760 align:start position:0%
one of those solutions that I U just
 
00:19:08.789 --> 00:19:08.799 align:start position:0%
presented to you the providers would
 
00:19:10.789 --> 00:19:10.799 align:start position:0%
have gotten additional funding would
 
00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
have gotten more funding was it
 
00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:15.480 align:start position:0%
everything they wanted no it was not
 
00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:17.720 align:start position:0%
everything they wanted and I will say to
 
00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
the carrier's credit each and every time
 
00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:21.880 align:start position:0%
we've put one of these Solutions on the
 
00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:24.520 align:start position:0%
table none of them ran out of the room
 
00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:26.360 align:start position:0%
they were all willing to negotiate they
 
00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:28.640 align:start position:0%
weren't in love with it uh but I don't
 
00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:30.200 align:start position:0%
think that they particularly like the
 
00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:33.240 align:start position:0%
status quo either so unfortunately as I
 
00:19:35.789 --> 00:19:35.799 align:start position:0%
said we weren't able to come up with a
 
00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
solution that was universally embraced
 
00:19:40.789 --> 00:19:40.799 align:start position:0%
but what I will say is that the federal
 
00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:43.000 align:start position:0%
government is coming uh they have not
 
00:19:45.029 --> 00:19:45.039 align:start position:0%
forgotten that there is this Gap in the
 
00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:48.200 align:start position:0%
no surprises act with ground ambulance
 
00:19:50.029 --> 00:19:50.039 align:start position:0%
and I don't know what their solution to
 
00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
this is going to be but I think in the
 
00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:53.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire tradition we would much
 
00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
prefer to have our own solution that is
 
00:19:59.110 --> 00:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
attentive to the needs of of this state
 
00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
rather than having the federal
 
00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:02.840 align:start position:0%
government impose whatever it is that
 
00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
they're going to bring forward on this
 
00:20:07.149 --> 00:20:07.159 align:start position:0%
uh so that that's a little bit of the
 
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
context and the history that I wanted to
 
00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
provide to you I will say I have a great
 
00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
deal of concern for the commercial
 
00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:16.390 align:start position:0%
deal of concern for the commercial
ambulance

00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:16.400 align:start position:0%
ambulance
 
00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
providers that's not to say that I don't
 
00:20:21.029 --> 00:20:21.039 align:start position:0%
have concern for the municipal providers
 
00:20:22.669 --> 00:20:22.679 align:start position:0%
but the municipal providers at the end
 
00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:24.280 align:start position:0%
of the day have a back
 
00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:28.200 align:start position:0%
stop you and I uh and and the fire
 
00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
budgets that our communities ultimately
 
00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
pass and ultimately we as property
 
00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:34.440 align:start position:0%
taxpayers pay for the commercial
 
00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
providers do not and those are the
 
00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
entities that I'm very concerned about
 
00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:42.440 align:start position:0%
um and as I said it was unfortunate we
 
00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:43.960 align:start position:0%
couldn't get to an agreement but there
 
00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
are solutions out there and I think that
 
00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:48.760 align:start position:0%
as you approach this you want to do so
 
00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
in a comprehensive way um so those are
 
00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:54.520 align:start position:0%
my thoughts Michelle anything to add um
 
00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
just with respect to direct pay that is
 
00:20:59.390 --> 00:20:59.400 align:start position:0%
kind of one of of the bargaining chips
 
00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
so if you allow them to get direct pay
 
00:21:03.909 --> 00:21:03.919 align:start position:0%
now there's less of an incentive for
 
00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:06.280 align:start position:0%
them to come to the table and negotiate
 
00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
negotiate out these remaining issues and
 
00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:10.120 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day it's still
 
00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:12.200 align:start position:0%
allowing balance billing so when we hear
 
00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
all of these stories I think probably
 
00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:15.480 align:start position:0%
everyone in this room has heard a story
 
00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
about someone getting build you know 10
 
00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
$15,000 when all the ambulance head was
 
00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
taken from um one facility to another
 
00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
down the street or was an emergency call
 
00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:29.400 align:start position:0%
right down the street
 
00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
those stories are what's impacting
 
00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:33.440 align:start position:0%
consumers and when we're talking about
 
00:21:34.909 --> 00:21:34.919 align:start position:0%
consumers we're talking about like
 
00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
representative hunt said those that are
 
00:21:39.669 --> 00:21:39.679 align:start position:0%
purchasing commercial insurance in the
 
00:21:41.549 --> 00:21:41.559 align:start position:0%
individual and small group markets
 
00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:43.720 align:start position:0%
primarily there are some large group but
 
00:21:45.669 --> 00:21:45.679 align:start position:0%
most large group is self-insured and
 
00:21:48.149 --> 00:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
outside of our jurisdiction and this
 
00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
bill is not going to fix that for them
 
00:21:51.909 --> 00:21:51.919 align:start position:0%
they're still going to get that bill for
 
00:21:51.919 --> 00:21:52.950 align:start position:0%
they're still going to get that bill for
that

00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:21:55.669 --> 00:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
outstanding $9,000
 
00:21:58.830 --> 00:21:58.840 align:start position:0%
$8,000 that the consumer is legally
 
00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
liable for
 
00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:03.720 align:start position:0%
so as representative hunt phrased it out
 
00:22:05.149 --> 00:22:05.159 align:start position:0%
of the goodness of their hearts if the
 
00:22:07.549 --> 00:22:07.559 align:start position:0%
insurer decides to cut a check to the
 
00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
consumer that's great but they're not
 
00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
legally obligated to do that and until
 
00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:13.640 align:start position:0%
we come up with a solution that
 
00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
prohibited balance billing in some way
 
00:22:18.149 --> 00:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
it may not address everything and it's
 
00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
going to be a work in progress but the
 
00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
first step in the right direction is
 
00:22:23.909 --> 00:22:23.919 align:start position:0%
prohibit balance
 
00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:26.360 align:start position:0%
billing and I would just say to that too
 
00:22:29.149 --> 00:22:29.159 align:start position:0%
as representative hunt of highlighted
 
00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire insurance department
 
00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
only regulates approximately
 
00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
30% of the health insurance Market in
 
00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire the rest of it are the
 
00:22:39.549 --> 00:22:39.559 align:start position:0%
government programs Medicare Medicaid
 
00:22:42.269 --> 00:22:42.279 align:start position:0%
and then the the self-funded um plans
 
00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
are obviously outside of our
 
00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:46.520 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction as well um what I will say
 
00:22:50.269 --> 00:22:50.279 align:start position:0%
is I firmly believe that the status quo
 
00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:53.720 align:start position:0%
is unsustainable for the providers and
 
00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:54.710 align:start position:0%
is unsustainable for the providers and
for

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
consumers I'm happy to continue the
 
00:22:59.549 --> 00:22:59.559 align:start position:0%
conversation with all of the parties and
 
00:23:01.269 --> 00:23:01.279 align:start position:0%
stakeholders to try to figure out what
 
00:23:05.029 --> 00:23:05.039 align:start position:0%
the solution is uh but I will say that
 
00:23:07.789 --> 00:23:07.799 align:start position:0%
even if you pass this bill it isn't the
 
00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:10.520 align:start position:0%
it is not the fundamental
 
00:23:14.269 --> 00:23:14.279 align:start position:0%
reform that this system
 
00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:17.000 align:start position:0%
needs great so the question I have is do
 
00:23:21.909 --> 00:23:21.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:27.080 align:start position:0%
bill so if if we interpret this bill is
 
00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:29.240 align:start position:0%
that it's not about balance it's not
 
00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:33.240 align:start position:0%
about the uh the the balance billing
 
00:23:36.149 --> 00:23:36.159 align:start position:0%
billing or receiving or check writing it
 
00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:38.200 align:start position:0%
is simply because it says subject to the
 
00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:40.360 align:start position:0%
terms and conditions of the policy
 
00:23:43.029 --> 00:23:43.039 align:start position:0%
plan that we should just go ahead and
 
00:23:45.669 --> 00:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
pass this bill which just removes the
 
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
the check payment still will go to the
 
00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
ambulance company but that check that's
 
00:23:51.789 --> 00:23:51.799 align:start position:0%
going to go through to them is based
 
00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:53.720 align:start position:0%
upon whether they're in network or out
 
00:23:56.190 --> 00:23:56.200 align:start position:0%
of network and what the insurance
 
00:23:58.110 --> 00:23:58.120 align:start position:0%
company was re reimbursing based on some
 
00:23:59.789 --> 00:23:59.799 align:start position:0%
those conditions so if they're in
 
00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
network it's already going directly to
 
00:24:03.909 --> 00:24:03.919 align:start position:0%
the provider if they're out of network
 
00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
and you pass this bill that means the
 
00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:08.840 align:start position:0%
allowed amount the amount that the the
 
00:24:11.149 --> 00:24:11.159 align:start position:0%
insurer says is commercially reasonable
 
00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
for the rates being right for what's
 
00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:15.240 align:start position:0%
being charged that check would go
 
00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:17.200 align:start position:0%
directly to the provider corre and then
 
00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
the balance billing check would go back
 
00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:23.240 align:start position:0%
to the consumer if they so generously do
 
00:24:27.389 --> 00:24:27.399 align:start position:0%
that yes but doing that makes it
 
00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:29.320 align:start position:0%
provides less incentive for the
 
00:24:33.029 --> 00:24:33.039 align:start position:0%
providers to come in network because now
 
00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
they don't have to get that direct pck
 
00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
but the check is going to be smaller yes
 
00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:38.600 align:start position:0%
significantly small and then they've got
 
00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:41.320 align:start position:0%
to struggle to go get that balance
 
00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:45.080 align:start position:0%
payment yes so there is it's not I mean
 
00:24:46.789 --> 00:24:46.799 align:start position:0%
you could say there is some disadvantage
 
00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
but you know there's there's a little
 
00:24:51.549 --> 00:24:51.559 align:start position:0%
play in there that might make it work
 
00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:55.240 align:start position:0%
and uh so I I I guess at this point I
 
00:24:57.029 --> 00:24:57.039 align:start position:0%
would be willing just to pass this as
 
00:24:59.269 --> 00:24:59.279 align:start position:0%
written unless someone can shly tell me
 
00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
this is a bad
 
00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:03.149 align:start position:0%
this is a bad
idea

00:25:03.149 --> 00:25:03.159 align:start position:0%
idea
 
00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you thank you so this is just
 
00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:10.760 align:start position:0%
for a small segment as we discussed so
 
00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:14.720 align:start position:0%
the rest of the um percentages of the
 
00:25:18.269 --> 00:25:18.279 align:start position:0%
different tiers of insurance if the what
 
00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:20.840 align:start position:0%
happens to that quote balance
 
00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
Bill the consumer will still get the
 
00:25:26.029 --> 00:25:26.039 align:start position:0%
bill from the provider and still be
 
00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:28.120 align:start position:0%
liable for paying that out standing
 
00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
amount so just to give some perspective
 
00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
we use um Medicare rates kind of as a
 
00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:35.440 align:start position:0%
basemark in a lot of um Health cost
 
00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
stuff so right now um and it really
 
00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
depends on the code and whether you're
 
00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
rural super rural urban so there's a lot
 
00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:45.200 align:start position:0%
of varying factors but most allowed
 
00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
amounts are around you know 120 to 150%
 
00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
of Medicare what's being build sometimes
 
00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
is over 700% of Medicare so that larger
 
00:25:58.830 --> 00:25:58.840 align:start position:0%
amount is what the consumer is still
 
00:26:00.669 --> 00:26:00.679 align:start position:0%
going to be liable for so if the
 
00:26:02.909 --> 00:26:02.919 align:start position:0%
consumer takes the Check Cashes it and
 
00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:05.000 align:start position:0%
then doesn't pay the provider the
 
00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:06.360 align:start position:0%
provider is the one that needs to go
 
00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
after the consumer and that's where this
 
00:26:09.549 --> 00:26:09.559 align:start position:0%
problem is because the providers either
 
00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:11.200 align:start position:0%
don't have the bandwidth to do it or
 
00:26:13.029 --> 00:26:13.039 align:start position:0%
they don't want to because it's you know
 
00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
their neighbor or something this doesn't
 
00:26:17.029 --> 00:26:17.039 align:start position:0%
change that problem at all and that's
 
00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
the majority of the money we're talking
 
00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:28.120 align:start position:0%
Burrows sorry
 
00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
okay so um I guess my question is um so
 
00:26:33.389 --> 00:26:33.399 align:start position:0%
there the commission met over the summer
 
00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:35.320 align:start position:0%
and in the fall and so we still know
 
00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:39.200 align:start position:0%
have so we do not have a consensus so is
 
00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:41.200 align:start position:0%
your feeling that we still should not
 
00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
pass this bill to give relief and wait
 
00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:48.120 align:start position:0%
till waiting for gdau I guess to to fix
 
00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
it does it he doesn't okay gdau never
 
00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:53.000 align:start position:0%
showed up no I didn't realize look
 
00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:54.320 align:start position:0%
whether or not to move forward with this
 
00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
legislation is a policy call that's
 
00:26:57.669 --> 00:26:57.679 align:start position:0%
that's for you to make if you're asking
 
00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
my opinion I think in order to address
 
00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:02.440 align:start position:0%
the issue as a whole you're going to
 
00:27:03.789 --> 00:27:03.799 align:start position:0%
want to move forward with something a
 
00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
little bit more comprehensive of which
 
00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:08.360 align:start position:0%
this would be an integral
 
00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
part followup I I just I I this is a
 
00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:15.240 align:start position:0%
would you believe um is would you
 
00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:17.480 align:start position:0%
believe that it's going to be a very
 
00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:19.640 align:start position:0%
long time before we have a
 
00:27:23.669 --> 00:27:23.679 align:start position:0%
comprehensive um plan and I don't see a
 
00:27:26.789 --> 00:27:26.799 align:start position:0%
problem with if there's in this case the
 
00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:28.440 align:start position:0%
ambulance provided are really hurting
 
00:27:30.269 --> 00:27:30.279 align:start position:0%
could go out of business I don't see a
 
00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
problem with addressing a piece of that
 
00:27:34.789 --> 00:27:34.799 align:start position:0%
until we have the comprehensive plan
 
00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:36.440 align:start position:0%
well I would just say I I don't know
 
00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:38.600 align:start position:0%
that I would completely agree with that
 
00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
because as I said before you do have the
 
00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:43.000 align:start position:0%
fact that the federal government is is
 
00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
working on a proposal right now to deal
 
00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:47.480 align:start position:0%
with balance billing on ground ambulance
 
00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
Senate Apprentice is very involved with
 
00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:52.480 align:start position:0%
that effort uh their proposal is
 
00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:55.000 align:start position:0%
currently uh proprietary but at some
 
00:27:57.149 --> 00:27:57.159 align:start position:0%
point it is going to come forward I
 
00:27:58.990 --> 00:27:59.000 align:start position:0%
don't know what that will look like as I
 
00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:00.360 align:start position:0%
said before I
 
00:28:02.909 --> 00:28:02.919 align:start position:0%
think we want to have a New Hampshire
 
00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
solution rather than than a a solution
 
00:28:07.149 --> 00:28:07.159 align:start position:0%
imposed Upon Us by the federal
 
00:28:09.389 --> 00:28:09.399 align:start position:0%
government that may or may not
 
00:28:12.549 --> 00:28:12.559 align:start position:0%
work and and look as I said before you
 
00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:15.200 align:start position:0%
know the proposals that we put forward
 
00:28:16.990 --> 00:28:17.000 align:start position:0%
didn't get consensus but at the end of
 
00:28:21.269 --> 00:28:21.279 align:start position:0%
the day it all all of them provided the
 
00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
ambulance providers with additional
 
00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:24.789 align:start position:0%
ambulance providers with additional
financial

00:28:24.789 --> 00:28:24.799 align:start position:0%
financial
 
00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
support so that was forward progress the
 
00:28:30.029 --> 00:28:30.039 align:start position:0%
problem that we seem to run into was
 
00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:32.600 align:start position:0%
that for one provider or another it
 
00:28:35.789 --> 00:28:35.799 align:start position:0%
wasn't enough it wasn't uh sufficient to
 
00:28:37.389 --> 00:28:37.399 align:start position:0%
cover all of their
 
00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:40.360 align:start position:0%
costs well my view of it was well let's
 
00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
let's make some progress on this let's
 
00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
get you some more support and we can
 
00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:47.640 align:start position:0%
keep working on this in the future but
 
00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
that unfortunately fell
 
00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:53.000 align:start position:0%
apart well that some people might say
 
00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:55.480 align:start position:0%
that we're we're putting off by passing
 
00:28:59.110 --> 00:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
this bill we're putting off the the uh
 
00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:04.200 align:start position:0%
the incentive to get the issue solved
 
00:29:07.789 --> 00:29:07.799 align:start position:0%
coming uh well I I would also add though
 
00:29:10.269 --> 00:29:10.279 align:start position:0%
that some providers do do I'm not
 
00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
providers sorry carriers are directly
 
00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
paying already so they have the option
 
00:29:18.389 --> 00:29:18.399 align:start position:0%
to direct pay or to pay the consumer and
 
00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:20.360 align:start position:0%
not everyone is paying the consumer so I
 
00:29:23.389 --> 00:29:23.399 align:start position:0%
think overall they're not going to see
 
00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
much I mean I'm speculating here but I
 
00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:26.120 align:start position:0%
don't think they're going to see the
 
00:29:29.789 --> 00:29:29.799 align:start position:0%
relief they're expecting by this bill
 
00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:32.320 align:start position:0%
passing yes
 
00:29:35.029 --> 00:29:35.039 align:start position:0%
representative so this bill will not do
 
00:29:39.029 --> 00:29:39.039 align:start position:0%
any harm it might move the ball forward
 
00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
incrementally but what will it we all
 
00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
see it as an issue but what will it take
 
00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
to get the conversations going again and
 
00:29:51.950 --> 00:29:51.960 align:start position:0%
making sure that we could keep making
 
00:29:56.029 --> 00:29:56.039 align:start position:0%
progress no no is not an answer I think
 
00:29:57.950 --> 00:29:57.960 align:start position:0%
the big sticking point point that we're
 
00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:02.240 align:start position:0%
at is this philosophical divide as to
 
00:30:05.149 --> 00:30:05.159 align:start position:0%
the underlying issue of Commercial
 
00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:07.960 align:start position:0%
Insurance can't cover the full cost of
 
00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:10.480 align:start position:0%
providing emergency services so who's
 
00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
going to make up that Gap do you want to
 
00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:15.960 align:start position:0%
raise rates on Commercial insurers to
 
00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
bridge that Gap and doing so could cause
 
00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
upward pressure on insurance premiums
 
00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:23.440 align:start position:0%
and the people paying those are people
 
00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
in the individual and small group
 
00:30:28.509 --> 00:30:28.519 align:start position:0%
markets predominantly or or is it up to
 
00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers to bridge that Gap and I
 
00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
think that's the fundamental divide if
 
00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:36.360 align:start position:0%
we had a decision as to who should be
 
00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:39.320 align:start position:0%
paying that then we have a way forward
 
00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:41.080 align:start position:0%
but right now it's all over the place
 
00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
some people think balance spilling is
 
00:30:44.909 --> 00:30:44.919 align:start position:0%
great and that the consumer who uses the
 
00:30:47.789 --> 00:30:47.799 align:start position:0%
services should have to pick up the um
 
00:30:50.389 --> 00:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
that Gap in money others feel that it's
 
00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:52.240 align:start position:0%
the commercial insurers who should be
 
00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:54.640 align:start position:0%
picking up that Tab and bridging that
 
00:30:56.549 --> 00:30:56.559 align:start position:0%
Gap and then others feel that it's the
 
00:30:59.509 --> 00:30:59.519 align:start position:0%
communities the communities decide what
 
00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:02.120 align:start position:0%
is um appropriate emergency services and
 
00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
how much they want to spend on funding
 
00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
that and they're the ones that should be
 
00:31:07.909 --> 00:31:07.919 align:start position:0%
Bridging the Gap so that fundamental
 
00:31:10.029 --> 00:31:10.039 align:start position:0%
issue right there is what causes us to
 
00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:12.760 align:start position:0%
not get consensus on any of these um
 
00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:15.240 align:start position:0%
smaller pieces if we had some direction
 
00:31:17.389 --> 00:31:17.399 align:start position:0%
that way then I think it'd be easier for
 
00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
everyone to come to the table and we say
 
00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:21.200 align:start position:0%
the legislature has said this is how it
 
00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:23.320 align:start position:0%
should be funded so let's work on that
 
00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
aspect but I don't know how you go about
 
00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:28.760 align:start position:0%
doing that other than a finding in my in
 
00:31:31.509 --> 00:31:31.519 align:start position:0%
my perspective the problem is
 
00:31:34.789 --> 00:31:34.799 align:start position:0%
Medicare Medicare is the Lion Share of
 
00:31:37.029 --> 00:31:37.039 align:start position:0%
ambulances and Medicare is the one
 
00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
that's not paying enough and even if we
 
00:31:41.389 --> 00:31:41.399 align:start position:0%
were to just say okay we're going to
 
00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
make our base the individual insurance
 
00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:45.880 align:start position:0%
uh equal to what Medicare well they're
 
00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:49.720 align:start position:0%
already greater so yeah it's Medicare is
 
00:31:52.029 --> 00:31:52.039 align:start position:0%
where where the money needs to come from
 
00:31:54.269 --> 00:31:54.279 align:start position:0%
and yes that's federal government and
 
00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:56.320 align:start position:0%
yes they they did it for everybody they
 
00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
did balance billing for everybody
 
00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:00.440 align:start position:0%
including ambul I mean helicopters but
 
00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:02.720 align:start position:0%
they didn't do it for the ground
 
00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
ambulance so okay thank you very
 
00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:09.440 align:start position:0%
much uh how does everybody want to think
 
00:32:11.629 --> 00:32:11.639 align:start position:0%
about this before we take any action or
 
00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:16.120 align:start position:0%
or people want to just run run with this
 
00:32:18.629 --> 00:32:18.639 align:start position:0%
amendment the bill as it as it's written
 
00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:20.360 align:start position:0%
or should we make sure it really says
 
00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
what we think it's supposed to say and
 
00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
so you want to take sub take a sub
 
00:32:28.269 --> 00:32:28.279 align:start position:0%
committee or should we wait no take it
 
00:32:31.029 --> 00:32:31.039 align:start position:0%
okay no excuse me no Amendment this is
 
00:32:33.029 --> 00:32:33.039 align:start position:0%
the bill we're going to vote the bill as
 
00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
is as
 
00:32:39.269 --> 00:32:39.279 align:start position:0%
is okay anybody have any reason why we
 
00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
should not vote this bill as is speak
 
00:32:44.149 --> 00:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:49.789 --> 00:32:49.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:49.799 --> 00:32:52.070 align:start position:0%
 
have

00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:32:55.029 --> 00:32:55.039 align:start position:0%
Terry that's matching okay all right so
 
00:32:58.350 --> 00:32:58.360 align:start position:0%
it's uh hunt MCU belli Burrows and
 
00:33:01.389 --> 00:33:01.399 align:start position:0%
collabro okay all those in favor of I'll
 
00:33:04.029 --> 00:33:04.039 align:start position:0%
make a motion of ought to
 
00:33:04.039 --> 00:33:09.710 align:start position:0%
make a motion of ought to
pass

00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:09.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:12.760 align:start position:0%
second okay all those in favor of a to
 
00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
pass raise your
 
00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:21.930 --> 00:33:21.940 align:start position:0%
four six so it' be six who's not
 
00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:24.990 align:start position:0%
four six so it' be six who's not
[Music]

00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:25.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:33:28.629 --> 00:33:28.639 align:start position:0%
voting one two
 
00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
wait minute you only have one two three
 
00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:34.480 align:start position:0%
four five six seven names who's missing
 
00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:37.360 align:start position:0%
in that list five here okay all right
 
00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
anyway we got we got a vote we got a
 
00:33:40.669 --> 00:33:40.679 align:start position:0%
five votes that's we're good
 
00:33:45.149 --> 00:33:45.159 align:start position:0%
enough five zip
 
00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
I well we but you said but Gibbs is not
 
00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:50.720 align:start position:0%
here Gibbs isn't here and Terry so
 
00:33:53.710 --> 00:33:53.720 align:start position:0%
that's so seven and Terry's not here
 
00:33:57.710 --> 00:33:57.720 align:start position:0%
right okay and who was the other person
 
00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:00.360 align:start position:0%
oh Vincent okay so we missing a Democrat
 
00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
okay we're fine no we don't we're all
 
00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
set we got five set
 
00:34:12.109 --> 00:34:12.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:20.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:21.790 align:start position:0%
 
Z

00:34:21.790 --> 00:34:21.800 align:start position:0%
Z
 
00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:28.040 align:start position:0%
okay uh okay um 1296
 
00:34:32.109 --> 00:34:32.119 align:start position:0%
so we're waiting for a fiscal note on
 
00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:34.520 align:start position:0%
12 is that what we waiting for the a
 
00:34:40.149 --> 00:34:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
1296 yes hi Michelle heaten New
 
00:34:46.149 --> 00:34:46.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire insurance department um we did
 
00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
submit the fiscal note to OS last week
 
00:34:50.149 --> 00:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
but I'm sure they just haven't gotten
 
00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:52.720 align:start position:0%
around to they haven't got around
 
00:34:54.790 --> 00:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
finalizing it and getting it out so I do
 
00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:14.240 align:start position:0%
so as those are going around I can kind
 
00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:16.680 align:start position:0%
of summarize things a little bit for you
 
00:35:19.589 --> 00:35:19.599 align:start position:0%
um there will be some impact but at this
 
00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:21.800 align:start position:0%
point it's in determinable we don't know
 
00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
how much we think it would be relatively
 
00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
low part of the problem with this is
 
00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:28.640 align:start position:0%
that is with respect to cost sharing
 
00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:30.280 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of variables when you're
 
00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:32.320 align:start position:0%
trying to predict cost sharing because
 
00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:35.000 align:start position:0%
it depends on the individual's plan and
 
00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:37.240 align:start position:0%
we don't know who's going to need these
 
00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:39.160 align:start position:0%
services and what types of plans they're
 
00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:41.800 align:start position:0%
in if they have a platinum plan their
 
00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:44.240 align:start position:0%
cost sharing is a lot lower than someone
 
00:35:47.349 --> 00:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
with a bronze plan so it's very hard to
 
00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
estimate the impact here um but we did
 
00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
do some uh we looked at some chis data
 
00:35:59.190 --> 00:35:59.200 align:start position:0%
for these types of services and overall
 
00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
most of these are provided with um
 
00:36:06.069 --> 00:36:06.079 align:start position:0%
little to no cost sharing um and I
 
00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
it so the mean cost of um cost sharing
 
00:36:16.870 --> 00:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
for these Services was nonzero but
 
00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
trivial across the three most commonly
 
00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:21.400 align:start position:0%
buil diagnostic mamography
 
00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:23.400 align:start position:0%
services um and those are the codes
 
00:36:27.309 --> 00:36:27.319 align:start position:0%
there um we had 34,000 codes which is a
 
00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
lot lower than all of the mammograms um
 
00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:31.430 align:start position:0%
lot lower than all of the mammograms um
being

00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:36:33.550 --> 00:36:33.560 align:start position:0%
conducted for commercial insurers and
 
00:36:35.349 --> 00:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
manag Care organizations the median cost
 
00:36:38.349 --> 00:36:38.359 align:start position:0%
sharing was zero so that means that most
 
00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
of them have no cost sharing um but for
 
00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
some diagnosis we observed a non-m
 
00:36:46.390 --> 00:36:46.400 align:start position:0%
median cost value of less than $100 so
 
00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
the cost sharing was under um
 
00:36:52.309 --> 00:36:52.319 align:start position:0%
$100 the median cost sharing for those
 
00:36:54.109 --> 00:36:54.119 align:start position:0%
who had cost sharing was under
 
00:36:58.230 --> 00:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
$100 and that's about uh 0 3% so overall
 
00:36:59.790 --> 00:36:59.800 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a small impact but
 
00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:02.720 align:start position:0%
again estimating cost sharing is very
 
00:37:04.829 --> 00:37:04.839 align:start position:0%
hard to do especially too you have to
 
00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
think of the out-of-pocket Max so if
 
00:37:09.790 --> 00:37:09.800 align:start position:0%
someone has a $5,000 out-of-pocket Max
 
00:37:11.829 --> 00:37:11.839 align:start position:0%
for their plan which is actually kind of
 
00:37:14.829 --> 00:37:14.839 align:start position:0%
low if they've already spent that 5,000
 
00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:16.200 align:start position:0%
then they don't have to pay any cost
 
00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:18.520 align:start position:0%
sharing for this so depending on when
 
00:37:20.069 --> 00:37:20.079 align:start position:0%
someone got the services if it's later
 
00:37:21.069 --> 00:37:21.079 align:start position:0%
in the year and they already met their
 
00:37:22.309 --> 00:37:22.319 align:start position:0%
cost sharing they may have nothing if
 
00:37:23.589 --> 00:37:23.599 align:start position:0%
it's earlier in the year and they have
 
00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
not messed their their um out-of pocket
 
00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
max then they need may need to pay more
 
00:37:29.470 --> 00:37:29.480 align:start position:0%
so that's why it's very difficult
 
00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of different variables
 
00:37:32.829 --> 00:37:32.839 align:start position:0%
here so it's very difficult difficult to
 
00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:35.400 align:start position:0%
assess the cost of it so I'm happy to
 
00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:37.280 align:start position:0%
answer any
 
00:37:40.910 --> 00:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
questions okay well the bill
 
00:37:43.109 --> 00:37:43.119 align:start position:0%
says no
 
00:37:45.349 --> 00:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
deductible it says that it wouldn't be
 
00:37:47.829 --> 00:37:47.839 align:start position:0%
part of it you can't apply cost sharing
 
00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
to these Services exactly yes so if
 
00:37:51.790 --> 00:37:51.800 align:start position:0%
someone had a
 
00:37:54.309 --> 00:37:54.319 align:start position:0%
5,000 then that would mean that would
 
00:37:56.309 --> 00:37:56.319 align:start position:0%
mean it would cost the insurance company
 
00:37:58.550 --> 00:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
have to to they would have to pay the
 
00:37:58.560 --> 00:37:59.750 align:start position:0%
have to to they would have to pay the
full

00:37:59.750 --> 00:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
full
 
00:38:01.790 --> 00:38:01.800 align:start position:0%
amount well it would depend on your
 
00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
outof pocket max for your plan and
 
00:38:05.349 --> 00:38:05.359 align:start position:0%
whether you've already met it that's
 
00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:07.720 align:start position:0%
with estimating the overall cost for
 
00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:10.640 align:start position:0%
this but we see the um median of those
 
00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
who pay out of um who have cost sharing
 
00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:16.440 align:start position:0%
associated with it as being less than
 
00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
$100 for these specific services but
 
00:38:21.309 --> 00:38:21.319 align:start position:0%
that's very deductible you're talking
 
00:38:23.349 --> 00:38:23.359 align:start position:0%
not necessarily it could be you know Co
 
00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:25.880 align:start position:0%
Insurance co-pay um they haven't met
 
00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:27.440 align:start position:0%
their out of pocket Max or maybe they
 
00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
only have a small amount left to meet
 
00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
their out of pocket max so there's a lot
 
00:38:31.870 --> 00:38:31.880 align:start position:0%
of different variables that make it
 
00:38:34.270 --> 00:38:34.280 align:start position:0%
difficult to estimate I guess I'm still
 
00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
fuzzy let make sure I understand okay um
 
00:38:38.910 --> 00:38:38.920 align:start position:0%
I have a
 
00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:40.710 align:start position:0%
I have a
$5,000

00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:40.720 align:start position:0%
$5,000
 
00:38:45.349 --> 00:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
deductible right and this is the only
 
00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
thing we say not me my wife okay this is
 
00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
the only thing my wife needs is this
 
00:38:56.670 --> 00:38:56.680 align:start position:0%
thing and we see that it it costs like
 
00:39:00.270 --> 00:39:00.280 align:start position:0%
$2,000 to operate this unit
 
00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
okay that is not $100 that's
 
00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:07.160 align:start position:0%
$2,000 that I have to pay the way I read
 
00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
the bill and I'm trying to find my copy
 
00:39:14.589 --> 00:39:14.599 align:start position:0%
of it is that that that 2,000 will get
 
00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:18.040 align:start position:0%
waved yes if your plan says that for
 
00:39:19.910 --> 00:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
these Services you have to meet your
 
00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:22.720 align:start position:0%
deductible first if there's a co-pay or
 
00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:25.240 align:start position:0%
C um co- Insurance associated with the
 
00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
service you'd only have to pay the
 
00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
co-pay or the co- Insurance until you
 
00:39:30.109 --> 00:39:30.119 align:start position:0%
meet your deductible and out- of- pocket
 
00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
that's the way the Bill's written yes so
 
00:39:34.030 --> 00:39:34.040 align:start position:0%
it would it would wave any cost sharing
 
00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
and it would depend on the plan design
 
00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
to determine what that means for each
 
00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:42.040 align:start position:0%
person and there's a lot of variability
 
00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
in plan design that's why it's very hard
 
00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
to estimate how the F uh fiscal impact
 
00:39:50.309 --> 00:39:50.319 align:start position:0%
of this if it were to be enacted but
 
00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:52.240 align:start position:0%
based on the claims data we're
 
00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
estimating that it'll be relatively low
 
00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
but there is an impact
 
00:40:00.430 --> 00:40:00.440 align:start position:0%
on on the current claims data yes but on
 
00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
the current claims data the the
 
00:40:06.430 --> 00:40:06.440 align:start position:0%
deductible is being paid by the
 
00:40:08.430 --> 00:40:08.440 align:start position:0%
patient yes if that's what the plan
 
00:40:11.109 --> 00:40:11.119 align:start position:0%
designed so your plan could say that
 
00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
right but we're more interested in what
 
00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
happens if we pass this legislation
 
00:40:17.470 --> 00:40:17.480 align:start position:0%
where it says the deductible is no
 
00:40:19.589 --> 00:40:19.599 align:start position:0%
longer that that the patient doesn't
 
00:40:22.309 --> 00:40:22.319 align:start position:0%
have to pay the deduc yes so how much is
 
00:40:24.349 --> 00:40:24.359 align:start position:0%
that going to be and that's what's hard
 
00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
to figure out because every plan
 
00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
will charge a different amount so if it
 
00:40:30.829 --> 00:40:30.839 align:start position:0%
goes to your deductible then yeah you
 
00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
could be stuck paying that $2,000 and
 
00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:34.640 align:start position:0%
this bill would fix that so you don't
 
00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:36.920 align:start position:0%
have to pay anything for other people it
 
00:40:39.829 --> 00:40:39.839 align:start position:0%
could be $50 co-pay for this service so
 
00:40:41.550 --> 00:40:41.560 align:start position:0%
now they don't have to pay that $50
 
00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:44.680 align:start position:0%
co-pay 50 is nominal right I'm I'm
 
00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:47.440 align:start position:0%
focusing I'm focusing in on people who
 
00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
have high deductible
 
00:40:53.390 --> 00:40:53.400 align:start position:0%
plans yeah so then it would be a higher
 
00:40:56.589 --> 00:40:56.599 align:start position:0%
impact for that and that 2,000 GRS and
 
00:40:58.790 --> 00:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
and that and then so the guesstimate is
 
00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
how many how many women on an annual
 
00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:06.200 align:start position:0%
basis would have just saved the
 
00:41:09.230 --> 00:41:09.240 align:start position:0%
$2,000 if we have P if we pass this bill
 
00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:11.200 align:start position:0%
yeah and that's very hard to determine
 
00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
because we don't know how many of that
 
00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:15.240 align:start position:0%
would take way more analysis to figure
 
00:41:18.109 --> 00:41:18.119 align:start position:0%
out okay what kind of plan the people
 
00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
getting these Services have high
 
00:41:21.870 --> 00:41:21.880 align:start position:0%
deductible health plans are usually for
 
00:41:24.349 --> 00:41:24.359 align:start position:0%
younger people who are relatively
 
00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
healthy these services
 
00:41:28.829 --> 00:41:28.839 align:start position:0%
um can apply to anyone at any time in
 
00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
life so it's very hard to estimate that
 
00:41:33.550 --> 00:41:33.560 align:start position:0%
and it really is dependent on the type
 
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
of plan you have how much of an impact
 
00:41:37.630 --> 00:41:37.640 align:start position:0%
this bill would have on okay
 
00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:42.270 align:start position:0%
this bill would have on okay
representative

00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:42.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:45.630 --> 00:41:45.640 align:start position:0%
spear thank you uh at the first meeting
 
00:41:48.109 --> 00:41:48.119 align:start position:0%
we had on this subject uh we were given
 
00:41:50.430 --> 00:41:50.440 align:start position:0%
information in in the typical way that I
 
00:41:54.550 --> 00:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
have I of course verified all of it uh
 
00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:55.800 align:start position:0%
there are quite a few states that
 
00:41:58.109 --> 00:41:58.119 align:start position:0%
already have passed this kind of
 
00:42:01.349 --> 00:42:01.359 align:start position:0%
legislation and we were given a stack of
 
00:42:04.589 --> 00:42:04.599 align:start position:0%
analysis about that thick showing us
 
00:42:07.150 --> 00:42:07.160 align:start position:0%
what the the type of analysis that went
 
00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:09.960 align:start position:0%
into the cost increase for
 
00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:11.800 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and it was very very
 
00:42:15.309 --> 00:42:15.319 align:start position:0%
detailed and it came down to 13 to 33
 
00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
cents and it's been enacted it looks
 
00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:20.200 align:start position:0%
like about 18
 
00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
states it seems to me that the data does
 
00:42:25.109 --> 00:42:25.119 align:start position:0%
exist for you to figure this out at
 
00:42:27.630 --> 00:42:27.640 align:start position:0%
least at the level that Massachusetts
 
00:42:30.109 --> 00:42:30.119 align:start position:0%
figured it out so I would think if you
 
00:42:31.630 --> 00:42:31.640 align:start position:0%
need this I'd be glad to give you my
 
00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:34.480 align:start position:0%
copy of it uh that there is a way to get
 
00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
this information it shouldn't have been
 
00:42:37.710 --> 00:42:37.720 align:start position:0%
that hard I would think because it it
 
00:42:40.910 --> 00:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
already exists what we can do is and
 
00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:42.640 align:start position:0%
this would be a much more detailed
 
00:42:44.190 --> 00:42:44.200 align:start position:0%
analysis that would require a lot more
 
00:42:46.109 --> 00:42:46.119 align:start position:0%
time and may need um an outside
 
00:42:48.190 --> 00:42:48.200 align:start position:0%
consultant to help out with so that
 
00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:49.720 align:start position:0%
would be different I was suspecting it
 
00:42:51.790 --> 00:42:51.800 align:start position:0%
was a mandate analysis and usually in
 
00:42:53.549 --> 00:42:53.559 align:start position:0%
States when they request that mandate
 
00:42:56.270 --> 00:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
analysis it's um you know actuaries get
 
00:42:58.790 --> 00:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
involved it's a lot more detailed but we
 
00:43:02.190 --> 00:43:02.200 align:start position:0%
won't be able to estimate moving forward
 
00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
with too much specificity because it
 
00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:06.720 align:start position:0%
really depends on what type of plan the
 
00:43:09.950 --> 00:43:09.960 align:start position:0%
person has Massachusetts is not always
 
00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
analogous to New Hampshire because they
 
00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
have mass health um and they have a lot
 
00:43:15.630 --> 00:43:15.640 align:start position:0%
of different other programs their
 
00:43:16.990 --> 00:43:17.000 align:start position:0%
Market's very different than in New
 
00:43:18.349 --> 00:43:18.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so you can't use that
 
00:43:21.109 --> 00:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
necessarily as a comparison what we did
 
00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
is we looked at the last year of claims
 
00:43:26.990 --> 00:43:27.000 align:start position:0%
data that we have for these diagnostic
 
00:43:30.150 --> 00:43:30.160 align:start position:0%
codes what was the median cost sharing
 
00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:32.720 align:start position:0%
and the median cost sharing is zero so
 
00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:35.160 align:start position:0%
it could be that there's no cost sharing
 
00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
because these people have already hit
 
00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
their out-of-pocket Max so they're not
 
00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
incurring any cost it could be that they
 
00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
have plans that cover these without Co
 
00:43:46.069 --> 00:43:46.079 align:start position:0%
Insurance there's a lot of different
 
00:43:49.150 --> 00:43:49.160 align:start position:0%
variables that go into play so without
 
00:43:51.150 --> 00:43:51.160 align:start position:0%
doing a deep dive into this data and
 
00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
figuring out what kind of plan did these
 
00:43:55.470 --> 00:43:55.480 align:start position:0%
people have why is there no cost sharing
 
00:43:58.150 --> 00:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
for them and then why are um of the
 
00:43:59.950 --> 00:43:59.960 align:start position:0%
people who did have cost sharing why is
 
00:44:03.670 --> 00:44:03.680 align:start position:0%
it under a 100 the median for that um
 
00:44:05.230 --> 00:44:05.240 align:start position:0%
some people definitely did pay more some
 
00:44:07.390 --> 00:44:07.400 align:start position:0%
people paid less um but there's a lot of
 
00:44:09.390 --> 00:44:09.400 align:start position:0%
variability here so we can look back at
 
00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:11.160 align:start position:0%
our claims at it and try to figure this
 
00:44:14.349 --> 00:44:14.359 align:start position:0%
out but even in Massachusetts seems like
 
00:44:16.829 --> 00:44:16.839 align:start position:0%
they gave a range so we're saying that
 
00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:19.160 align:start position:0%
this will cause an impact on premium
 
00:44:22.069 --> 00:44:22.079 align:start position:0%
well not necessarily on premium is Will
 
00:44:24.109 --> 00:44:24.119 align:start position:0%
insurers will have increased Health
 
00:44:26.670 --> 00:44:26.680 align:start position:0%
costs and we think it's relative L low
 
00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
increases but we can't give much more
 
00:44:32.069 --> 00:44:32.079 align:start position:0%
specif specificity without doing a much
 
00:44:35.390 --> 00:44:35.400 align:start position:0%
more detailed study right so yes I I
 
00:44:38.790 --> 00:44:38.800 align:start position:0%
just had to follow on I based on what I
 
00:44:41.630 --> 00:44:41.640 align:start position:0%
see the range of states are states like
 
00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
Montana Colorado New Mexico Arkansas
 
00:44:46.549 --> 00:44:46.559 align:start position:0%
Missouri Illinois Tennessee Georgia
 
00:44:48.309 --> 00:44:48.319 align:start position:0%
between all of those States we can't
 
00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:50.720 align:start position:0%
find a state that is similar to
 
00:44:53.589 --> 00:44:53.599 align:start position:0%
ours no because a lot of those states
 
00:44:56.349 --> 00:44:56.359 align:start position:0%
have lot larger populations the dynamics
 
00:44:58.430 --> 00:44:58.440 align:start position:0%
of their Market I know monana does not
 
00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:00.200 align:start position:0%
they're half our
 
00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
population but um the market how many
 
00:45:04.750 --> 00:45:04.760 align:start position:0%
players are in it what type of mandates
 
00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
they already have in place all of these
 
00:45:08.309 --> 00:45:08.319 align:start position:0%
things factor in and you would need a
 
00:45:10.109 --> 00:45:10.119 align:start position:0%
much more in-depth study to figure that
 
00:45:12.750 --> 00:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
out which we could do um we have the
 
00:45:14.230 --> 00:45:14.240 align:start position:0%
ability to do that as a mandate study
 
00:45:16.390 --> 00:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
but those studies typically run us
 
00:45:17.829 --> 00:45:17.839 align:start position:0%
between 22 and
 
00:45:20.790 --> 00:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
$44,000 to complete that
 
00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
study right now we've already talked
 
00:45:24.910 --> 00:45:24.920 align:start position:0%
about this already uh I don't know if
 
00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:26.640 align:start position:0%
you were here when we did
 
00:45:28.990 --> 00:45:29.000 align:start position:0%
last week okay so that that the mandated
 
00:45:31.109 --> 00:45:31.119 align:start position:0%
study um is something that's been on the
 
00:45:34.270 --> 00:45:34.280 align:start position:0%
statute for 10 about 15 years and that
 
00:45:35.790 --> 00:45:35.800 align:start position:0%
whenever we get these health insurance
 
00:45:37.790 --> 00:45:37.800 align:start position:0%
mandates that we really don't know how
 
00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
what what the impact is is that we have
 
00:45:45.390 --> 00:45:45.400 align:start position:0%
um have uh done done the study in that
 
00:45:47.950 --> 00:45:47.960 align:start position:0%
study you have you set up parameters
 
00:45:49.630 --> 00:45:49.640 align:start position:0%
about what is that you you want to look
 
00:45:52.829 --> 00:45:52.839 align:start position:0%
at and what we're thinking about um but
 
00:45:56.270 --> 00:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
I in my mind the big issue is that how
 
00:45:59.829 --> 00:45:59.839 align:start position:0%
how many how many Employers in the state
 
00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
actually have a very high deductible
 
00:46:03.150 --> 00:46:03.160 align:start position:0%
plant because that's really what drives
 
00:46:05.470 --> 00:46:05.480 align:start position:0%
it is the employer who is buying the
 
00:46:08.470 --> 00:46:08.480 align:start position:0%
policy for the employees if they have if
 
00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
if the employers and and I and I guess
 
00:46:13.510 --> 00:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
I'm guilty as an employer I I have a
 
00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
high deductible plan for my employees um
 
00:46:20.309 --> 00:46:20.319 align:start position:0%
and that and so in that my case it would
 
00:46:22.829 --> 00:46:22.839 align:start position:0%
be different but I I I don't have a
 
00:46:25.870 --> 00:46:25.880 align:start position:0%
woman on my has an employment so it's
 
00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
not an issue okay so not withstanding
 
00:46:31.589 --> 00:46:31.599 align:start position:0%
that the high deductible is that the
 
00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
question is does New Hampshire have a
 
00:46:34.710 --> 00:46:34.720 align:start position:0%
disproportionate amount of high
 
00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:35.950 align:start position:0%
disproportionate amount of high
deductible

00:46:35.950 --> 00:46:35.960 align:start position:0%
deductible
 
00:46:40.030 --> 00:46:40.040 align:start position:0%
plants okay the other issue in my mind
 
00:46:43.270 --> 00:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
is that you um you don't want adverse
 
00:46:45.150 --> 00:46:45.160 align:start position:0%
selection we want people to choose the
 
00:46:48.309 --> 00:46:48.319 align:start position:0%
plan that is right for them not because
 
00:46:50.309 --> 00:46:50.319 align:start position:0%
whether the high deductible or not is
 
00:46:52.150 --> 00:46:52.160 align:start position:0%
going to get covered for a certain
 
00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:54.520 align:start position:0%
mandated coverage or not so that's
 
00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
that's always been my loose loose end
 
00:46:58.030 --> 00:46:58.040 align:start position:0%
when it comes to these high deductible
 
00:47:01.630 --> 00:47:01.640 align:start position:0%
plans but in this case the the so that
 
00:47:03.829 --> 00:47:03.839 align:start position:0%
we would be asking the the way you would
 
00:47:06.309 --> 00:47:06.319 align:start position:0%
do it is we would interim study the bill
 
00:47:08.790 --> 00:47:08.800 align:start position:0%
we would be asking the department to do
 
00:47:13.390 --> 00:47:13.400 align:start position:0%
it an cost analysis and then come next
 
00:47:15.549 --> 00:47:15.559 align:start position:0%
year come next January we would then
 
00:47:18.069 --> 00:47:18.079 align:start position:0%
have that in hand and then make a
 
00:47:19.990 --> 00:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
decision what is the best way to to go
 
00:47:21.829 --> 00:47:21.839 align:start position:0%
forward with this this a procedural
 
00:47:26.109 --> 00:47:26.119 align:start position:0%
question then uh my understanding was an
 
00:47:27.950 --> 00:47:27.960 align:start position:0%
on an interim study bill in the second
 
00:47:30.309 --> 00:47:30.319 align:start position:0%
year it's just going to die it isn't
 
00:47:32.589 --> 00:47:32.599 align:start position:0%
going to go to any kind of a vote well
 
00:47:36.309 --> 00:47:36.319 align:start position:0%
what happens is next year okay is that
 
00:47:38.549 --> 00:47:38.559 align:start position:0%
every bill can come back
 
00:47:41.109 --> 00:47:41.119 align:start position:0%
again coming back so somebody would
 
00:47:44.109 --> 00:47:44.119 align:start position:0%
reintroduce the bill next year but in
 
00:47:46.069 --> 00:47:46.079 align:start position:0%
that public hearing and that reintroduce
 
00:47:48.349 --> 00:47:48.359 align:start position:0%
it would be that
 
00:47:50.990 --> 00:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
analysis the problem I'm having is that
 
00:47:52.829 --> 00:47:52.839 align:start position:0%
we have enough information and I did my
 
00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
own little research in that way that I
 
00:47:57.030 --> 00:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
have that there
 
00:48:00.430 --> 00:48:00.440 align:start position:0%
are too many states that are doing this
 
00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
to just keep putting it off and that
 
00:48:05.190 --> 00:48:05.200 align:start position:0%
women are being impacted I I think that
 
00:48:08.030 --> 00:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
there is enough data right now to say
 
00:48:12.270 --> 00:48:12.280 align:start position:0%
that we can do this or not do this
 
00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
okay representative burough thank you is
 
00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:16.160 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering if there's an
 
00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
industry person who could speak to this
 
00:48:22.589 --> 00:48:22.599 align:start position:0%
who um could tell us why this this is or
 
00:48:26.309 --> 00:48:26.319 align:start position:0%
isn't a good idea industry being
 
00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
um somebody who supports the
 
00:48:31.109 --> 00:48:31.119 align:start position:0%
bill that well that they were here
 
00:48:38.829 --> 00:48:38.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:42.109 --> 00:48:42.119 align:start position:0%
background right well um yeah I guess
 
00:48:44.430 --> 00:48:44.440 align:start position:0%
why don't you come on up
 
00:48:47.309 --> 00:48:47.319 align:start position:0%
and you're a sponsor of the bill right
 
00:48:52.750 --> 00:48:52.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:56.910 --> 00:48:56.920 align:start position:0%
is how many how how many tests could
 
00:49:00.910 --> 00:49:00.920 align:start position:0%
this cause in other words um if it's if
 
00:49:04.309 --> 00:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
it's a oneoff it's not a big deal if
 
00:49:06.589 --> 00:49:06.599 align:start position:0%
it's you know we one of the issues we
 
00:49:08.630 --> 00:49:08.640 align:start position:0%
had was we were discussing last week was
 
00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
that there theoretically it was going to
 
00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
go on for another four years it would be
 
00:49:15.349 --> 00:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
the free
 
00:49:18.430 --> 00:49:18.440 align:start position:0%
test yes I guess I would suggest two
 
00:49:20.309 --> 00:49:20.319 align:start position:0%
points that I don't believe we need an
 
00:49:21.870 --> 00:49:21.880 align:start position:0%
analysis at this point because it has
 
00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
been done in other states it is an
 
00:49:24.750 --> 00:49:24.760 align:start position:0%
expensive undertaking we already have
 
00:49:26.789 --> 00:49:26.799 align:start position:0%
heard and understand that is a limited
 
00:49:28.670 --> 00:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
cost we're looking at the particular
 
00:49:30.270 --> 00:49:30.280 align:start position:0%
point I wanted to make is just to
 
00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:32.240 align:start position:0%
reiterate this does not apply to pre
 
00:49:34.150 --> 00:49:34.160 align:start position:0%
High deductible plans you would have to
 
00:49:36.270 --> 00:49:36.280 align:start position:0%
pay your deductible before this bill
 
00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
would but it does say it does apply
 
00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
there's an exemption in there I I don't
 
00:49:40.750 --> 00:49:40.760 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I don't have the paper in
 
00:49:42.109 --> 00:49:42.119 align:start position:0%
front of me I should brought up with me
 
00:49:44.510 --> 00:49:44.520 align:start position:0%
but um well if the deductible is the
 
00:49:46.549 --> 00:49:46.559 align:start position:0%
only issue I have the co-pay is the
 
00:49:48.190 --> 00:49:48.200 align:start position:0%
co-pay is nothing so to take your
 
00:49:50.190 --> 00:49:50.200 align:start position:0%
example if I understood you correctly as
 
00:49:51.589 --> 00:49:51.599 align:start position:0%
the employer with your your employees
 
00:49:53.309 --> 00:49:53.319 align:start position:0%
having a high deductible plan they would
 
00:49:55.829 --> 00:49:55.839 align:start position:0%
have to pay their deductible before this
 
00:49:57.670 --> 00:49:57.680 align:start position:0%
bill would have effect okay so where
 
00:49:59.630 --> 00:49:59.640 align:start position:0%
where is that in the
 
00:50:03.150 --> 00:50:03.160 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you no oh you know what's
 
00:50:04.950 --> 00:50:04.960 align:start position:0%
weird you got the definitions before the
 
00:50:07.589 --> 00:50:07.599 align:start position:0%
statute so maybe an ordering issue that
 
00:50:10.109 --> 00:50:10.119 align:start position:0%
was a little bit confusing perhaps okay
 
00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
no group he Insurance off grou thank you
 
00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:16.829 align:start position:0%
no group he Insurance off grou thank you
yes

00:50:16.829 --> 00:50:16.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
uh any cost sharing requirements yes so
 
00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:22.640 align:start position:0%
line eight okay oh it said all right for
 
00:50:24.150 --> 00:50:24.160 align:start position:0%
healthare cont that meets the definition
 
00:50:26.829 --> 00:50:26.839 align:start position:0%
of a high deductible plan and set for
 
00:50:28.910 --> 00:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
this requirement shall only apply to the
 
00:50:33.069 --> 00:50:33.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
deductible for the year except other
 
00:50:37.789 --> 00:50:37.799 align:start position:0%
than the mamogram you know or I believe
 
00:50:40.270 --> 00:50:40.280 align:start position:0%
is the next phrase but um okay the point
 
00:50:41.510 --> 00:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
being that you have still have to meet
 
00:50:44.190 --> 00:50:44.200 align:start position:0%
your deductible before okay all right
 
00:50:47.589 --> 00:50:47.599 align:start position:0%
great thank you so now insurance
 
00:50:50.270 --> 00:50:50.280 align:start position:0%
department does this what does does
 
00:50:53.230 --> 00:50:53.240 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral 2 really say when I the
 
00:50:54.630 --> 00:50:54.640 align:start position:0%
definition what's a what's the
 
00:50:57.829 --> 00:50:57.839 align:start position:0%
definition of a High deductible plan do
 
00:50:59.789 --> 00:50:59.799 align:start position:0%
we even have that in our
 
00:51:02.829 --> 00:51:02.839 align:start position:0%
statute it's defined federally and I'd
 
00:51:05.390 --> 00:51:05.400 align:start position:0%
have to look at it exactly what but
 
00:51:07.950 --> 00:51:07.960 align:start position:0%
these are high deductible plans are
 
00:51:11.829 --> 00:51:11.839 align:start position:0%
designed for younger people and um the
 
00:51:14.430 --> 00:51:14.440 align:start position:0%
idea is you pay lower premiums because
 
00:51:17.910 --> 00:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
you're relatively healthy and you're
 
00:51:19.510 --> 00:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
risking that you're not going to have
 
00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:22.200 align:start position:0%
much at a cost so that's why very high
 
00:51:27.069 --> 00:51:27.079 align:start position:0%
dble I'm what's the sure EMP employers
 
00:51:28.309 --> 00:51:28.319 align:start position:0%
and I'd have to look that up I'm not
 
00:51:29.630 --> 00:51:29.640 align:start position:0%
sure if employers can buy High
 
00:51:31.910 --> 00:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
deductible plans it's a special type of
 
00:51:34.870 --> 00:51:34.880 align:start position:0%
plan it's not just a plan that you would
 
00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:36.880 align:start position:0%
relatively speaking think have a high
 
00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:39.480 align:start position:0%
deductible so you could have a plan that
 
00:51:41.950 --> 00:51:41.960 align:start position:0%
has you know a $10,000 deductible in
 
00:51:44.030 --> 00:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
theory that's not the same as a high
 
00:51:45.789 --> 00:51:45.799 align:start position:0%
deductible plan High deductible plans
 
00:51:48.589 --> 00:51:48.599 align:start position:0%
work differently and under federally
 
00:51:52.150 --> 00:51:52.160 align:start position:0%
those are um there are certain
 
00:51:53.549 --> 00:51:53.559 align:start position:0%
preventative Services that at the
 
00:51:55.109 --> 00:51:55.119 align:start position:0%
federal level have to be covered without
 
00:51:57.430 --> 00:51:57.440 align:start position:0%
cost sharing that applies to the high
 
00:52:00.589 --> 00:52:00.599 align:start position:0%
deductible plans but for this bill um it
 
00:52:02.950 --> 00:52:02.960 align:start position:0%
would not apply to those federally
 
00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
defined High deductible plans was just a
 
00:52:08.950 --> 00:52:08.960 align:start position:0%
separate type of plan right okay did you
 
00:52:12.430 --> 00:52:12.440 align:start position:0%
you found it okay yeah so it says the
 
00:52:15.190 --> 00:52:15.200 align:start position:0%
reference definition is 26 us code
 
00:52:17.309 --> 00:52:17.319 align:start position:0%
section 223 right so it says for
 
00:52:19.870 --> 00:52:19.880 align:start position:0%
calendar year two for calendar year 224
 
00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
a quote high deductible plan unquote is
 
00:52:25.349 --> 00:52:25.359 align:start position:0%
defined under 223 c2a as a health plan
 
00:52:27.069 --> 00:52:27.079 align:start position:0%
an annual DED annual deductible that is
 
00:52:29.309 --> 00:52:29.319 align:start position:0%
not less than 1,600 for self-only
 
00:52:32.549 --> 00:52:32.559 align:start position:0%
coverage or 3200 for family coverage and
 
00:52:34.069 --> 00:52:34.079 align:start position:0%
for which the annual outof pocket
 
00:52:36.150 --> 00:52:36.160 align:start position:0%
expenses parentheses deductibles co-
 
00:52:39.789 --> 00:52:39.799 align:start position:0%
payments and other amounts etc etc um
 
00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:49.349 --> 00:52:49.359 align:start position:0%
it so that that's 1600 per individual
 
00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:53.160 align:start position:0%
3200 so as an employer who has a $5,000
 
00:52:56.309 --> 00:52:56.319 align:start position:0%
plan but not premiums Okay so uh for
 
00:52:57.789 --> 00:52:57.799 align:start position:0%
which the annual outof pocket expenses
 
00:52:59.270 --> 00:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
deductible Co payments and other amounts
 
00:53:02.990 --> 00:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
but not premiums do not exceed $850 for
 
00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
self only 16,100 for family 8,000 that
 
00:53:08.789 --> 00:53:08.799 align:start position:0%
was no that's
 
00:53:12.069 --> 00:53:12.079 align:start position:0%
um out of pocket minimum so that's not
 
00:53:13.510 --> 00:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
the deductible that's the out of pocket
 
00:53:15.710 --> 00:53:15.720 align:start position:0%
right so the there that's what I'm I'm
 
00:53:17.990 --> 00:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
talking about is when it's talk our
 
00:53:20.829 --> 00:53:20.839 align:start position:0%
famous eobs right explanation of
 
00:53:23.309 --> 00:53:23.319 align:start position:0%
benefits Y and when we get those and
 
00:53:25.510 --> 00:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
they're going to say you know how much
 
00:53:28.030 --> 00:53:28.040 align:start position:0%
the insurance company's covering and how
 
00:53:31.510 --> 00:53:31.520 align:start position:0%
much I have to cover but that that uh
 
00:53:34.990 --> 00:53:35.000 align:start position:0%
that I have if I have a 5,000 deductible
 
00:53:38.230 --> 00:53:38.240 align:start position:0%
that means I've got to pay I gotta I got
 
00:53:40.789 --> 00:53:40.799 align:start position:0%
to pay that excess amount up until it
 
00:53:43.789 --> 00:53:43.799 align:start position:0%
reaches the uh the the dollar the full
 
00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
5,000 no no out a deductible and out of
 
00:53:47.309 --> 00:53:47.319 align:start position:0%
pocket are different so deductible is
 
00:53:49.390 --> 00:53:49.400 align:start position:0%
like you pay the first amount and then
 
00:53:51.549 --> 00:53:51.559 align:start position:0%
the deductible is usually 50 100 bucks
 
00:53:55.990 --> 00:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
nothing not nothing depends cop Co
 
00:53:58.430 --> 00:53:58.440 align:start position:0%
excuse me excuse me cop right copay is
 
00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:00.480 align:start position:0%
it it's the deductible that can be the
 
00:54:03.470 --> 00:54:03.480 align:start position:0%
high high amount then there's the out of
 
00:54:05.710 --> 00:54:05.720 align:start position:0%
pocket max which is the total so you may
 
00:54:08.109 --> 00:54:08.119 align:start position:0%
need to meet your deductible and then Co
 
00:54:10.069 --> 00:54:10.079 align:start position:0%
insurance will kick in until you meet
 
00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:12.640 align:start position:0%
your out of pocket max so for high
 
00:54:14.230 --> 00:54:14.240 align:start position:0%
deductible they're are they're a
 
00:54:17.710 --> 00:54:17.720 align:start position:0%
separate type of plan um and they have
 
00:54:20.230 --> 00:54:20.240 align:start position:0%
other requirements but the out of pocket
 
00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:22.640 align:start position:0%
max I believe you said is
 
00:54:26.190 --> 00:54:26.200 align:start position:0%
8,6 for the individual and
 
00:54:28.589 --> 00:54:28.599 align:start position:0%
161 for family so that's but they
 
00:54:30.349 --> 00:54:30.359 align:start position:0%
operate differently that includes
 
00:54:32.430 --> 00:54:32.440 align:start position:0%
everything like even your 25 bucks at
 
00:54:35.190 --> 00:54:35.200 align:start position:0%
CVS to pick up your prescription okay so
 
00:54:38.430 --> 00:54:38.440 align:start position:0%
this is a very narrow little exemption
 
00:54:40.829 --> 00:54:40.839 align:start position:0%
that we don't you need to have that to
 
00:54:42.470 --> 00:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
comp so that the plans comply with
 
00:54:43.990 --> 00:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
Federal requirements and IRS
 
00:54:48.069 --> 00:54:48.079 align:start position:0%
requirements for that type of plan okay
 
00:54:50.030 --> 00:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
uh I guess I'm I'm what I'm just trying
 
00:54:51.829 --> 00:54:51.839 align:start position:0%
to get at is what what is available what
 
00:54:54.190 --> 00:54:54.200 align:start position:0%
are people buying in New Hampshire and
 
00:54:57.750 --> 00:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
when these but I think like I have a I
 
00:54:59.109 --> 00:54:59.119 align:start position:0%
have a Harvard
 
00:55:02.549 --> 00:55:02.559 align:start position:0%
plan for my employees and I guess I
 
00:55:04.390 --> 00:55:04.400 align:start position:0%
guess I would ask you
 
00:55:07.190 --> 00:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
Peter so even then I have what I call
 
00:55:09.430 --> 00:55:09.440 align:start position:0%
the high deductible I had the I'm in the
 
00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
you know the small group Market I'm
 
00:55:13.670 --> 00:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
paying the high I'm paying the lowest
 
00:55:16.870 --> 00:55:16.880 align:start position:0%
possible premium and I have the highest
 
00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:18.750 align:start position:0%
possible premium and I have the highest
possible

00:55:18.750 --> 00:55:18.760 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:55:20.870 --> 00:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
deductible that's not necessarily a high
 
00:55:22.549 --> 00:55:22.559 align:start position:0%
deductible plan High deductible plans
 
00:55:25.829 --> 00:55:25.839 align:start position:0%
work differently but Dr as is is here
 
00:55:28.349 --> 00:55:28.359 align:start position:0%
and he did the um analysis of the chis
 
00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
data and I believe correct me if I'm
 
00:55:32.109 --> 00:55:32.119 align:start position:0%
wrong Jason but um when he was looking
 
00:55:33.950 --> 00:55:33.960 align:start position:0%
at it it didn't look like anyone that
 
00:55:37.109 --> 00:55:37.119 align:start position:0%
had these high deductible Health Plans
 
00:55:39.870 --> 00:55:39.880 align:start position:0%
um had any of these services in the last
 
00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
year so because they're usually more
 
00:55:45.270 --> 00:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
younger more relatively healthy people
 
00:55:47.829 --> 00:55:47.839 align:start position:0%
that are um buy those types of plans
 
00:55:50.750 --> 00:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
because you're responsible for paying
 
00:55:52.270 --> 00:55:52.280 align:start position:0%
most of your healthcare costs until you
 
00:55:54.510 --> 00:55:54.520 align:start position:0%
meet that out of pocket max where the
 
00:55:56.309 --> 00:55:56.319 align:start position:0%
more additional health insurance that
 
00:55:58.950 --> 00:55:58.960 align:start position:0%
you're thinking of hmos ppos um the
 
00:56:01.390 --> 00:56:01.400 align:start position:0%
insurer is paying parts of it until you
 
00:56:03.190 --> 00:56:03.200 align:start position:0%
re your chair out of pocket max and then
 
00:56:04.789 --> 00:56:04.799 align:start position:0%
they cover all of it so it's a little
 
00:56:06.990 --> 00:56:07.000 align:start position:0%
bit different and that's why you would
 
00:56:08.910 --> 00:56:08.920 align:start position:0%
have lower deductibles if you have
 
00:56:10.910 --> 00:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
higher cost
 
00:56:13.190 --> 00:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
sharings if you have higher deductibles
 
00:56:15.069 --> 00:56:15.079 align:start position:0%
then you're usually going to have lower
 
00:56:15.079 --> 00:56:16.390 align:start position:0%
then you're usually going to have lower
cost

00:56:16.390 --> 00:56:16.400 align:start position:0%
cost
 
00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:18.390 align:start position:0%
cost
sharings

00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
sharings
 
00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:20.670 align:start position:0%
sharings
okay

00:56:20.670 --> 00:56:20.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:56:22.829 --> 00:56:22.839 align:start position:0%
okay so you're think this is not going
 
00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
to cost
 
00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:25.710 align:start position:0%
to cost
much

00:56:25.710 --> 00:56:25.720 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:56:25.720 --> 00:56:27.829 align:start position:0%
much
relatively

00:56:27.829 --> 00:56:27.839 align:start position:0%
relatively
 
00:56:30.510 --> 00:56:30.520 align:start position:0%
small may I just add the postcript for
 
00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:32.720 align:start position:0%
what we our hearing will be relatively
 
00:56:35.950 --> 00:56:35.960 align:start position:0%
small impact an $80 charge for a patient
 
00:56:37.349 --> 00:56:37.359 align:start position:0%
who's not going to have followup is
 
00:56:39.069 --> 00:56:39.079 align:start position:0%
going to have huge ramifications and we
 
00:56:40.670 --> 00:56:40.680 align:start position:0%
have heard testimony that effect I think
 
00:56:43.870 --> 00:56:43.880 align:start position:0%
you got some emails this week um so what
 
00:56:46.270 --> 00:56:46.280 align:start position:0%
is a small cost perhaps or limited cost
 
00:56:48.789 --> 00:56:48.799 align:start position:0%
overall to insures is a huge impact on
 
00:56:51.109 --> 00:56:51.119 align:start position:0%
patients and all of us down the road
 
00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:52.880 align:start position:0%
okay get off my soap box now all right
 
00:56:55.190 --> 00:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
great so um thank you thank you very
 
00:56:58.390 --> 00:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
much so Heidi uh and Sabrina you guys
 
00:57:00.910 --> 00:57:00.920 align:start position:0%
want to tell us if you know anything
 
00:57:03.309 --> 00:57:03.319 align:start position:0%
different in terms of what this analysis
 
00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
is and that this is not going to have a
 
00:57:11.309 --> 00:57:11.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:11.319 --> 00:57:18.750 align:start position:0%
 
premium

00:57:18.750 --> 00:57:18.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
Heidi good morning Mr chairman um
 
00:57:23.069 --> 00:57:23.079 align:start position:0%
members of the committee Heidi croll
 
00:57:25.309 --> 00:57:25.319 align:start position:0%
Gallagher Callahan and gartell on behalf
 
00:57:27.069 --> 00:57:27.079 align:start position:0%
of ahip so I don't have anything to add
 
00:57:28.870 --> 00:57:28.880 align:start position:0%
to I don't have any insights into the
 
00:57:31.910 --> 00:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
cost impact I would say that um on the
 
00:57:33.349 --> 00:57:33.359 align:start position:0%
high deductible Health lands I know
 
00:57:36.470 --> 00:57:36.480 align:start position:0%
there's also an um the health savings
 
00:57:39.589 --> 00:57:39.599 align:start position:0%
account has a piece to that I thought in
 
00:57:44.589 --> 00:57:44.599 align:start position:0%
terms of IRS that um that
 
00:57:47.990 --> 00:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
the if you violate the definition of a
 
00:57:51.589 --> 00:57:51.599 align:start position:0%
high deductible health plan then the tax
 
00:57:54.349 --> 00:57:54.359 align:start position:0%
advantage of the health savings account
 
00:57:56.589 --> 00:57:56.599 align:start position:0%
is put into Jeopardy and you potentially
 
00:57:58.870 --> 00:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
have the patient is left with a
 
00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:00.190 align:start position:0%
have the patient is left with a
liability

00:58:00.190 --> 00:58:00.200 align:start position:0%
liability
 
00:58:02.910 --> 00:58:02.920 align:start position:0%
so I don't I don't know how that all
 
00:58:04.829 --> 00:58:04.839 align:start position:0%
fits into what you just heard but it's
 
00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
just another for example I know where I
 
00:58:08.470 --> 00:58:08.480 align:start position:0%
work we have a high deductible health
 
00:58:11.430 --> 00:58:11.440 align:start position:0%
plan with a health savings account tied
 
00:58:13.950 --> 00:58:13.960 align:start position:0%
to it so so you might be you might be
 
00:58:18.150 --> 00:58:18.160 align:start position:0%
your employ so might be impacted by this
 
00:58:19.710 --> 00:58:19.720 align:start position:0%
USC section
 
00:58:22.230 --> 00:58:22.240 align:start position:0%
223c right right that that part and then
 
00:58:23.950 --> 00:58:23.960 align:start position:0%
the other thing I guess I would just say
 
00:58:26.710 --> 00:58:26.720 align:start position:0%
um with respect to the you know any sort
 
00:58:30.309 --> 00:58:30.319 align:start position:0%
of um in the current situation um where
 
00:58:33.150 --> 00:58:33.160 align:start position:0%
people have bills with providers um to
 
00:58:34.990 --> 00:58:35.000 align:start position:0%
the best of my knowledge most providers
 
00:58:37.990 --> 00:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
will um work with people to have payment
 
00:58:40.789 --> 00:58:40.799 align:start position:0%
plans so I just wanted to put that into
 
00:58:43.309 --> 00:58:43.319 align:start position:0%
the the people if if in the example that
 
00:58:45.150 --> 00:58:45.160 align:start position:0%
was given that you know paying $80 out
 
00:58:47.630 --> 00:58:47.640 align:start position:0%
of pocket at that particular moment is
 
00:58:51.230 --> 00:58:51.240 align:start position:0%
not feasible um to my understanding most
 
00:58:53.390 --> 00:58:53.400 align:start position:0%
providers are very willing to to come up
 
00:58:55.270 --> 00:58:55.280 align:start position:0%
with payment plans so right right which
 
00:58:57.510 --> 00:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
would help spread it out at least so you
 
00:59:00.950 --> 00:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
not all at that that's just the uh the
 
00:59:06.430 --> 00:59:06.440 align:start position:0%
copay copay yeah okay thank you all
 
00:59:10.430 --> 00:59:10.440 align:start position:0%
right okay um because
 
00:59:12.670 --> 00:59:12.680 align:start position:0%
yeah because I know we have then the
 
00:59:14.870 --> 00:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
other one was the the diabetes the
 
00:59:17.829 --> 00:59:17.839 align:start position:0%
monitoring devices for the diabetes but
 
00:59:19.470 --> 00:59:19.480 align:start position:0%
I think that one we were talking about
 
00:59:22.309 --> 00:59:22.319 align:start position:0%
going into to doing the study to find
 
00:59:24.029 --> 00:59:24.039 align:start position:0%
out what what that was that one we
 
00:59:27.029 --> 00:59:27.039 align:start position:0%
talked about we need to do the study so
 
00:59:30.270 --> 00:59:30.280 align:start position:0%
um okay so if people want to pass this
 
00:59:31.990 --> 00:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
bill thinking that it's not going to
 
00:59:40.589 --> 00:59:40.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:44.870 --> 00:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
two okay so uh representative Burrows
 
00:59:46.789 --> 00:59:46.799 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative hunt moves
 
00:59:53.630 --> 00:59:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:53.640 --> 00:59:58.390 align:start position:0%
 
pass

00:59:58.390 --> 00:59:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:00.349 --> 01:00:00.359 align:start position:0%
any discussion on the
 
01:00:03.549 --> 01:00:03.559 align:start position:0%
motion say none all all those who favor
 
01:00:09.109 --> 01:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
say I one two three three four five
 
01:00:13.349 --> 01:00:13.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:13.359 --> 01:00:18.589 align:start position:0%
 
Z

01:00:18.589 --> 01:00:18.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:22.230 --> 01:00:22.240 align:start position:0%
okay five Z
 
01:00:25.069 --> 01:00:25.079 align:start position:0%
okay all right moving right along next
 
01:00:28.270 --> 01:00:28.280 align:start position:0%
up is
 
01:00:32.190 --> 01:00:32.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:35.309 --> 01:00:35.319 align:start position:0%
interests so I understanding is that
 
01:00:37.789 --> 01:00:37.799 align:start position:0%
there was a conflict of interest did
 
01:00:40.670 --> 01:00:40.680 align:start position:0%
already come up with this board and that
 
01:00:43.950 --> 01:00:43.960 align:start position:0%
person did resign anybody here involved
 
01:00:45.230 --> 01:00:45.240 align:start position:0%
in this
 
01:00:50.109 --> 01:00:50.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:52.349 --> 01:00:52.359 align:start position:0%
room that you can confirm that did
 
01:00:54.349 --> 01:00:54.359 align:start position:0%
happen so at this point I'm not sure
 
01:00:58.390 --> 01:00:58.400 align:start position:0%
this really a problem here um but I
 
01:01:00.630 --> 01:01:00.640 align:start position:0%
guess we could hold have do an interim
 
01:01:02.150 --> 01:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
study so that in case a problem does
 
01:01:04.270 --> 01:01:04.280 align:start position:0%
come up we can then do something in the
 
01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
future is everybody comfortable with
 
01:01:08.270 --> 01:01:08.280 align:start position:0%
doing an inter room
 
01:01:18.670 --> 01:01:18.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
right yeah the amendment was insane
 
01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:49.710 align:start position:0%
right yeah the amendment was insane
sorry

01:01:49.710 --> 01:01:49.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
so the recommendation is interim
 
01:01:53.440 --> 01:02:40.710 align:start position:0%
so the recommendation is interim
study

01:02:40.710 --> 01:02:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:42.470 --> 01:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
so then the next one the
 
01:02:46.829 --> 01:02:46.839 align:start position:0%
glucose um so I I think you did send me
 
01:02:49.549 --> 01:02:49.559 align:start position:0%
a what we what we should be asking for
 
01:02:53.349 --> 01:02:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:53.359 --> 01:02:56.109 align:start position:0%
 
study

01:02:56.109 --> 01:02:56.119 align:start position:0%
study
 
01:02:58.630 --> 01:02:58.640 align:start position:0%
yes I sent you an email outlining kind
 
01:03:02.950 --> 01:03:02.960 align:start position:0%
of um how the studies work um as I
 
01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned before usually we uh consult
 
01:03:08.269 --> 01:03:08.279 align:start position:0%
with outside experts on this and some of
 
01:03:11.069 --> 01:03:11.079 align:start position:0%
these studies can range between 22,000
 
01:03:14.549 --> 01:03:14.559 align:start position:0%
44,000 uh I we also outlined how we
 
01:03:17.230 --> 01:03:17.240 align:start position:0%
believe the study should progress so
 
01:03:18.870 --> 01:03:18.880 align:start position:0%
that you have the best information on
 
01:03:22.430 --> 01:03:22.440 align:start position:0%
how to uh attack this issue and I have
 
01:03:25.150 --> 01:03:25.160 align:start position:0%
Dr AIS here who can talk about how that
 
01:03:26.230 --> 01:03:26.240 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:03:29.510 --> 01:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
designed so do you have yeah so normally
 
01:03:32.430 --> 01:03:32.440 align:start position:0%
with some of these mandate mandate
 
01:03:34.349 --> 01:03:34.359 align:start position:0%
studies or quasi mandate studies we try
 
01:03:36.670 --> 01:03:36.680 align:start position:0%
to do a few things which I talked to
 
01:03:38.510 --> 01:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
Michelle to find out what does this bill
 
01:03:41.349 --> 01:03:41.359 align:start position:0%
aim to do that's usually with regards to
 
01:03:44.349 --> 01:03:44.359 align:start position:0%
expansion of the eligible population and
 
01:03:47.150 --> 01:03:47.160 align:start position:0%
or expansion of the covered benefits in
 
01:03:49.309 --> 01:03:49.319 align:start position:0%
any cost sharing implication so we
 
01:03:51.870 --> 01:03:51.880 align:start position:0%
usually look at that in in terms of
 
01:03:54.390 --> 01:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
different domains the size of of the the
 
01:03:56.710 --> 01:03:56.720 align:start position:0%
new population the size of the new
 
01:03:58.910 --> 01:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
benefit and any other economic
 
01:04:01.230 --> 01:04:01.240 align:start position:0%
implications for the different
 
01:04:03.910 --> 01:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
parameters of cost sharing so we we say
 
01:04:05.150 --> 01:04:05.160 align:start position:0%
cost sharing we're talking about
 
01:04:09.230 --> 01:04:09.240 align:start position:0%
deductible co-pay and co- Insurance
 
01:04:11.950 --> 01:04:11.960 align:start position:0%
collectively and so that's generally the
 
01:04:14.950 --> 01:04:14.960 align:start position:0%
the analytic framework that we use to do
 
01:04:16.670 --> 01:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
a claims analysis for any purpose
 
01:04:19.230 --> 01:04:19.240 align:start position:0%
including the fiscal note
 
01:04:22.549 --> 01:04:22.559 align:start position:0%
worksheets okay any questions from
 
01:04:26.470 --> 01:04:26.480 align:start position:0%
committee members so so just to um
 
01:04:30.029 --> 01:04:30.039 align:start position:0%
obviously we have type one and type two
 
01:04:33.549 --> 01:04:33.559 align:start position:0%
and then we have the you know g g
 
01:04:36.309 --> 01:04:36.319 align:start position:0%
something gdm right which is what what
 
01:04:39.750 --> 01:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
is gestational diet gestational yeah I I
 
01:04:41.950 --> 01:04:41.960 align:start position:0%
see that sounds like pre pregnancy to me
 
01:04:44.029 --> 01:04:44.039 align:start position:0%
but it is shows you
 
01:04:47.549 --> 01:04:47.559 align:start position:0%
it and um H hypoglycemia I believe is
 
01:04:50.950 --> 01:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
also a subclinical diagnosis included in
 
01:04:54.430 --> 01:04:54.440 align:start position:0%
this legislative language yeah okay so
 
01:04:57.549 --> 01:04:57.559 align:start position:0%
um and and then in terms of the
 
01:04:59.789 --> 01:04:59.799 align:start position:0%
pregnancy one that just says is that is
 
01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
that after a important time then they
 
01:05:04.430 --> 01:05:04.440 align:start position:0%
won't need it anymore or yeah it's not
 
01:05:05.910 --> 01:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
so it's really we're just covering while
 
01:05:07.470 --> 01:05:07.480 align:start position:0%
they're while they're pregnant to make
 
01:05:09.190 --> 01:05:09.200 align:start position:0%
sure that they're monitoring often times
 
01:05:12.510 --> 01:05:12.520 align:start position:0%
the 12 weeks subsequent delivery okay so
 
01:05:16.390 --> 01:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
it's just it's just call it a
 
01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:20.760 align:start position:0%
year okay um all right so yeah this
 
01:05:22.589 --> 01:05:22.599 align:start position:0%
mandate report if you asked us to do we
 
01:05:24.230 --> 01:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
would look at each one of these eligible
 
01:05:27.230 --> 01:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
populations and what that would mean for
 
01:05:28.990 --> 01:05:29.000 align:start position:0%
um providing these services in the
 
01:05:31.150 --> 01:05:31.160 align:start position:0%
increase in and premium we'd also be
 
01:05:33.069 --> 01:05:33.079 align:start position:0%
looking at the utility and medical
 
01:05:35.789 --> 01:05:35.799 align:start position:0%
efficacy of whether these populations
 
01:05:38.150 --> 01:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
can benefit from having these devices
 
01:05:41.670 --> 01:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
available good any other questions from
 
01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:43.230 align:start position:0%
available good any other questions from
committee

01:05:43.230 --> 01:05:43.240 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:05:45.950 --> 01:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
members okay um so I would move uh
 
01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:47.990 align:start position:0%
members okay um so I would move uh
interim

01:05:47.990 --> 01:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
interim
 
01:05:50.829 --> 01:05:50.839 align:start position:0%
study yes public hearing you would ask
 
01:05:52.510 --> 01:05:52.520 align:start position:0%
me to get some information I don't know
 
01:05:54.430 --> 01:05:54.440 align:start position:0%
if you oh great what what did you get
 
01:06:00.470 --> 01:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:03.349 --> 01:06:03.359 align:start position:0%
us I think one of the thank you Mr chair
 
01:06:04.470 --> 01:06:04.480 align:start position:0%
Peter bragon representing Harvard
 
01:06:06.190 --> 01:06:06.200 align:start position:0%
Pilgrim Healthcare as you may know the
 
01:06:07.910 --> 01:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
state's only non-for-profit health
 
01:06:10.029 --> 01:06:10.039 align:start position:0%
insurance company and you asked me to to
 
01:06:11.470 --> 01:06:11.480 align:start position:0%
get a couple of things but one of the
 
01:06:12.309 --> 01:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
issues was and I think it was
 
01:06:13.870 --> 01:06:13.880 align:start position:0%
representative Terry may have asked but
 
01:06:15.670 --> 01:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
we were told that this uh this same
 
01:06:17.349 --> 01:06:17.359 align:start position:0%
legislation appears in numerous other
 
01:06:18.829 --> 01:06:18.839 align:start position:0%
States including Rhode Island you may
 
01:06:20.670 --> 01:06:20.680 align:start position:0%
recall that and representar ask me don't
 
01:06:22.510 --> 01:06:22.520 align:start position:0%
you guys cover Rhode Island so uh can
 
01:06:23.670 --> 01:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
you tell us what your experience has
 
01:06:25.470 --> 01:06:25.480 align:start position:0%
been because this certainly can't cost a
 
01:06:27.470 --> 01:06:27.480 align:start position:0%
lot of money if Rhode Island is doing it
 
01:06:30.430 --> 01:06:30.440 align:start position:0%
so it turns out the Rhode Island bill um
 
01:06:32.589 --> 01:06:32.599 align:start position:0%
is nothing similar to this bill uh it
 
01:06:35.470 --> 01:06:35.480 align:start position:0%
requires coverage for glucose monitoring
 
01:06:38.150 --> 01:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
devices subject to all prior
 
01:06:39.750 --> 01:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
authorization and cost sharing
 
01:06:42.230 --> 01:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
limitations of existing policies on
 
01:06:45.029 --> 01:06:45.039 align:start position:0%
existing this bill removes all prior
 
01:06:48.309 --> 01:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
authorization and all cost share uh what
 
01:06:50.230 --> 01:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
we have now is what the Rhode Island
 
01:06:52.549 --> 01:06:52.559 align:start position:0%
Bill mandates that they cover it we
 
01:06:54.910 --> 01:06:54.920 align:start position:0%
already cover it uh the issue we have
 
01:06:58.029 --> 01:06:58.039 align:start position:0%
with this bill is this bill takes away
 
01:07:00.630 --> 01:07:00.640 align:start position:0%
prior authorization and takes away any
 
01:07:03.230 --> 01:07:03.240 align:start position:0%
um cost sharing uh which I think as the
 
01:07:06.470 --> 01:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
department does its cost study uh make
 
01:07:08.750 --> 01:07:08.760 align:start position:0%
sure that's included because without the
 
01:07:11.150 --> 01:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
prior authorization then these and the
 
01:07:13.190 --> 01:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
testimony was that conses glucose
 
01:07:16.029 --> 01:07:16.039 align:start position:0%
monitoring systems cost $500 per month
 
01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
uh and there's 100,000 uh diabetics in
 
01:07:19.950 --> 01:07:19.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so you do the math out and
 
01:07:22.150 --> 01:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
you're talking $600 million of expenses
 
01:07:24.630 --> 01:07:24.640 align:start position:0%
so uh so the key Ben the key as I was
 
01:07:26.990 --> 01:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
asked to find is uh this is nothing like
 
01:07:28.789 --> 01:07:28.799 align:start position:0%
the Rhode Island law right because of
 
01:07:30.950 --> 01:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
that those limitations we just had in
 
01:07:33.549 --> 01:07:33.559 align:start position:0%
the previous Bill correct um I was also
 
01:07:35.870 --> 01:07:35.880 align:start position:0%
asked what uh the medical guidelines
 
01:07:37.630 --> 01:07:37.640 align:start position:0%
were for Harvard for continuous glucose
 
01:07:39.349 --> 01:07:39.359 align:start position:0%
monitoring I can send that to you all
 
01:07:42.269 --> 01:07:42.279 align:start position:0%
it's uh probably eight pages um but then
 
01:07:43.510 --> 01:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
the process the other question I was
 
01:07:44.829 --> 01:07:44.839 align:start position:0%
asked is what are the process for
 
01:07:47.549 --> 01:07:47.559 align:start position:0%
determining medical necessity guidelines
 
01:07:50.390 --> 01:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
and at least within Harvard there's a uh
 
01:07:52.230 --> 01:07:52.240 align:start position:0%
panel of medical directors all of our
 
01:07:54.230 --> 01:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
medical directors of the different uh
 
01:07:56.230 --> 01:07:56.240 align:start position:0%
branches uh get together there's also
 
01:07:57.990 --> 01:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
members of staff for legal staff for
 
01:08:00.190 --> 01:08:00.200 align:start position:0%
instance and things like that um only
 
01:08:01.990 --> 01:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
the medical directors have a vote but
 
01:08:05.069 --> 01:08:05.079 align:start position:0%
the other staff can um provide input um
 
01:08:06.670 --> 01:08:06.680 align:start position:0%
and then they rely on subcommittees and
 
01:08:08.109 --> 01:08:08.119 align:start position:0%
there's a subcommittee for every
 
01:08:10.069 --> 01:08:10.079 align:start position:0%
individual practice so in this case
 
01:08:12.870 --> 01:08:12.880 align:start position:0%
there's a uh a advisory committee or
 
01:08:14.109 --> 01:08:14.119 align:start position:0%
advisory sub it's not even a
 
01:08:16.829 --> 01:08:16.839 align:start position:0%
subcommittee it's made up the the appr
 
01:08:19.149 --> 01:08:19.159 align:start position:0%
policy approval committee is all Harvard
 
01:08:22.669 --> 01:08:22.679 align:start position:0%
Pilgrim employees licensed uh medical
 
01:08:24.229 --> 01:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
directors who are employed their
 
01:08:26.309 --> 01:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
fulltime job is to study everything
 
01:08:28.749 --> 01:08:28.759 align:start position:0%
that's going on then they rely on
 
01:08:30.789 --> 01:08:30.799 align:start position:0%
advisory committees made up of
 
01:08:33.269 --> 01:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
practicing Physicians who are in network
 
01:08:34.749 --> 01:08:34.759 align:start position:0%
uh and they meet they have to meet at
 
01:08:37.430 --> 01:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
least annually or more often if new
 
01:08:39.950 --> 01:08:39.960 align:start position:0%
technologies come in that that may
 
01:08:42.829 --> 01:08:42.839 align:start position:0%
require uh some more look um and so we
 
01:08:45.110 --> 01:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
have a a provider Advisory Group on
 
01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:46.390 align:start position:0%
have a a provider Advisory Group on
endocr

01:08:46.390 --> 01:08:46.400 align:start position:0%
endocr
 
01:08:49.030 --> 01:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
Endocrinology which is the study of the
 
01:08:51.189 --> 01:08:51.199 align:start position:0%
the hormonal system production of
 
01:08:52.910 --> 01:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
production of insulin Etc they make
 
01:08:55.990 --> 01:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
recommendations to the policy approval
 
01:08:58.789 --> 01:08:58.799 align:start position:0%
committee um and again only the doctors
 
01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
on that committee actually have a vote
 
01:09:02.349 --> 01:09:02.359 align:start position:0%
as to what happens so the legal people
 
01:09:03.590 --> 01:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
can advise them about all that's going
 
01:09:05.030 --> 01:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
on but the doctors are the ones that
 
01:09:06.630 --> 01:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
vote on it so that's kind of a
 
01:09:08.110 --> 01:09:08.120 align:start position:0%
background they I wanted to put
 
01:09:09.229 --> 01:09:09.239 align:start position:0%
something in writing and they said well
 
01:09:10.390 --> 01:09:10.400 align:start position:0%
we'll have to have our legal department
 
01:09:12.070 --> 01:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
review that I said okay we don't have
 
01:09:13.749 --> 01:09:13.759 align:start position:0%
six months to wait for that so that's
 
01:09:15.030 --> 01:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
kind of the overall background so we
 
01:09:16.269 --> 01:09:16.279 align:start position:0%
just have tell everybody to watch this
 
01:09:17.910 --> 01:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
YouTube yeah I did I said you know I'm
 
01:09:20.149 --> 01:09:20.159 align:start position:0%
going to say it it's it's on YouTube so
 
01:09:21.829 --> 01:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
um that's that that's my understanding
 
01:09:24.110 --> 01:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
of it as an overview so I will send a
 
01:09:25.910 --> 01:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
the uh the document on so you're saying
 
01:09:28.309 --> 01:09:28.319 align:start position:0%
that the Rhode Island law implemented
 
01:09:29.950 --> 01:09:29.960 align:start position:0%
something that's everybody was already
 
01:09:31.510 --> 01:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
doing yeah mandates coverage of the
 
01:09:33.669 --> 01:09:33.679 align:start position:0%
things we already cover uh what this
 
01:09:35.349 --> 01:09:35.359 align:start position:0%
bill does it it says you have to cover
 
01:09:36.349 --> 01:09:36.359 align:start position:0%
all these things oh by the way there's
 
01:09:38.709 --> 01:09:38.719 align:start position:0%
no prior approval requirement so that so
 
01:09:40.349 --> 01:09:40.359 align:start position:0%
this bill does go further than that in
 
01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
terms it gu gets rid of all the mandates
 
01:09:44.709 --> 01:09:44.719 align:start position:0%
and all right and again it's the cost
 
01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
thing that that's cost going to come
 
01:09:47.390 --> 01:09:47.400 align:start position:0%
somewhere it's going to come from
 
01:09:50.390 --> 01:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
premiums and uh at some point people
 
01:09:52.189 --> 01:09:52.199 align:start position:0%
can't afford the concerns they have
 
01:09:54.149 --> 01:09:54.159 align:start position:0%
themselves okay so why did they passed
 
01:09:55.630 --> 01:09:55.640 align:start position:0%
the bill if everybody was doing it
 
01:09:57.910 --> 01:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
already you know sometimes as a former
 
01:09:59.709 --> 01:09:59.719 align:start position:0%
legislator I recall all things coming up
 
01:10:01.470 --> 01:10:01.480 align:start position:0%
and it uh it seems like the right thing
 
01:10:02.990 --> 01:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
to do or maybe you don't know it's
 
01:10:04.430 --> 01:10:04.440 align:start position:0%
already being done so or maybe you don't
 
01:10:06.070 --> 01:10:06.080 align:start position:0%
believe it's already being done so okay
 
01:10:07.630 --> 01:10:07.640 align:start position:0%
or maybe it's really old and people
 
01:10:09.510 --> 01:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
weren't doing it back then maybe could
 
01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
be we you don't you don't know how old
 
01:10:13.950 --> 01:10:13.960 align:start position:0%
the statue is on island I don't but I
 
01:10:15.830 --> 01:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
can find out figure figure out whether
 
01:10:18.270 --> 01:10:18.280 align:start position:0%
that because does seem a little weird
 
01:10:22.630 --> 01:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
but okay any uh anybody have any yeah uh
 
01:10:25.830 --> 01:10:25.840 align:start position:0%
oh turn your mic on Chris turn your mic
 
01:10:27.830 --> 01:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
on now I've done
 
01:10:34.189 --> 01:10:34.199 align:start position:0%
it so the the the the uh restraint on
 
01:10:38.189 --> 01:10:38.199 align:start position:0%
having $600 million go out the door is
 
01:10:40.750 --> 01:10:40.760 align:start position:0%
prior approval is is that the is that
 
01:10:43.030 --> 01:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
the basic restraint no the cost of the
 
01:10:45.350 --> 01:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
equipment well the the cost you say you
 
01:10:47.229 --> 01:10:47.239 align:start position:0%
can't have it then you don't have to pay
 
01:10:48.630 --> 01:10:48.640 align:start position:0%
for it yeah PRI and our prior
 
01:10:50.350 --> 01:10:50.360 align:start position:0%
authorization I I'll I'll well you know
 
01:10:52.630 --> 01:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
I got a few copies I'll just pass it
 
01:10:57.630 --> 01:10:57.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:03.870 --> 01:11:03.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:06.630 --> 01:11:06.640 align:start position:0%
ours and and I'm sure they have external
 
01:11:09.630 --> 01:11:09.640 align:start position:0%
grievance too uh yes and so a good thing
 
01:11:11.870 --> 01:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
to remind you is that uh if a prior
 
01:11:15.189 --> 01:11:15.199 align:start position:0%
authorization is denied um because uh
 
01:11:17.270 --> 01:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
the provider feels that the particular
 
01:11:19.750 --> 01:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
situation is different in some way then
 
01:11:21.030 --> 01:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
there's an appeal process that goes
 
01:11:23.669 --> 01:11:23.679 align:start position:0%
through both the uh both Harvard program
 
01:11:24.990 --> 01:11:25.000 align:start position:0%
as well as through the insurance
 
01:11:27.669 --> 01:11:27.679 align:start position:0%
department I believe if that's not
 
01:11:29.590 --> 01:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
satisfactory so in this particular one
 
01:11:31.030 --> 01:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
is a little confusing because it covers
 
01:11:32.470 --> 01:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
a bunch of different plans and different
 
01:11:34.709 --> 01:11:34.719 align:start position:0%
different states but uh the main piece
 
01:11:36.910 --> 01:11:36.920 align:start position:0%
is probably uh the the critical piece
 
01:11:38.510 --> 01:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire is on halfway down the
 
01:11:42.390 --> 01:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
second page um and it just lists out the
 
01:11:45.470 --> 01:11:45.480 align:start position:0%
criteria to use for continuous glucose
 
01:11:48.350 --> 01:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
monitoring so um you know number one it
 
01:11:49.709 --> 01:11:49.719 align:start position:0%
has to be prescribed by a professional
 
01:11:50.990 --> 01:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
provider in order to be considered
 
01:11:53.149 --> 01:11:53.159 align:start position:0%
medically necessary uh if it's medically
 
01:11:55.070 --> 01:11:55.080 align:start position:0%
necessary it's approved automatically so
 
01:11:56.470 --> 01:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
in order to be continued medically
 
01:11:57.669 --> 01:11:57.679 align:start position:0%
necessary it has to number one be
 
01:11:59.070 --> 01:11:59.080 align:start position:0%
prescribed by a professional provider
 
01:12:01.149 --> 01:12:01.159 align:start position:0%
with expertise in treating diabetes
 
01:12:03.669 --> 01:12:03.679 align:start position:0%
secondly the the member has to be on a
 
01:12:06.470 --> 01:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
treatment program already and again if
 
01:12:09.910 --> 01:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
the cost of um the monitoring strips is
 
01:12:11.990 --> 01:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
$20 a month and the cost of a continu
 
01:12:13.270 --> 01:12:13.280 align:start position:0%
gluc continuous glucose monitoring
 
01:12:15.590 --> 01:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
system is $500 a month we're going to
 
01:12:16.990 --> 01:12:17.000 align:start position:0%
want to they're likely going to want to
 
01:12:19.790 --> 01:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
start with the least expensive options
 
01:12:21.510 --> 01:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
to see if they work but at some point
 
01:12:23.229 --> 01:12:23.239 align:start position:0%
they don't work and I think there's a
 
01:12:24.750 --> 01:12:24.760 align:start position:0%
line in here that says that just at
 
01:12:28.270 --> 01:12:28.280 align:start position:0%
times the self um what's it called the
 
01:12:30.350 --> 01:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
self- administration self-monitoring
 
01:12:33.189 --> 01:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't work and so other things are
 
01:12:35.790 --> 01:12:35.800 align:start position:0%
necessary so these things are put
 
01:12:39.189 --> 01:12:39.199 align:start position:0%
together by the U medical guideline
 
01:12:40.990 --> 01:12:41.000 align:start position:0%
committee with the advice of in this
 
01:12:41.910 --> 01:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
case the
 
01:12:45.189 --> 01:12:45.199 align:start position:0%
endocrinologist uh advisory committee uh
 
01:12:47.709 --> 01:12:47.719 align:start position:0%
to apply so um well it's great it's
 
01:12:49.310 --> 01:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
always good to look under the uh under
 
01:12:51.830 --> 01:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
the under the hood under the hood here
 
01:12:54.629 --> 01:12:54.639 align:start position:0%
how the medical directors operate be
 
01:12:56.990 --> 01:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
careful when um people testify and say
 
01:12:57.790 --> 01:12:57.800 align:start position:0%
oh they're doing it in this state
 
01:12:58.950 --> 01:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
they're doing it that state or seven
 
01:13:00.350 --> 01:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
other states are doing this uh they're
 
01:13:01.950 --> 01:13:01.960 align:start position:0%
all doing something different so in this
 
01:13:04.070 --> 01:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
case the island is not the variation
 
01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:05.830 align:start position:0%
case the island is not the variation
yeah

01:13:05.830 --> 01:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:13:07.629 --> 01:13:07.639 align:start position:0%
good yes
 
01:13:09.750 --> 01:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
repres thank Mr
 
01:13:12.629 --> 01:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
chairman could you comment on um the
 
01:13:16.030 --> 01:13:16.040 align:start position:0%
professional shortterm CGM so you've got
 
01:13:18.750 --> 01:13:18.760 align:start position:0%
it at 7 to 14 days uh the only thing I
 
01:13:20.470 --> 01:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
know about that is that so there's two
 
01:13:21.629 --> 01:13:21.639 align:start position:0%
types there's one a professional
 
01:13:23.590 --> 01:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
short-term where the provider wants to
 
01:13:25.790 --> 01:13:25.800 align:start position:0%
get an idea of what's Happening uh
 
01:13:27.669 --> 01:13:27.679 align:start position:0%
versus a long-term thing to actually
 
01:13:30.470 --> 01:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
help the member uh manage their system
 
01:13:33.510 --> 01:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
and so the I think the short-term one is
 
01:13:36.950 --> 01:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
covered uh no matter what um to allow
 
01:13:38.910 --> 01:13:38.920 align:start position:0%
the provider to have the data they need
 
01:13:41.149 --> 01:13:41.159 align:start position:0%
to make a decision for like for gational
 
01:13:42.390 --> 01:13:42.400 align:start position:0%
that that's what I'm wondering is if we
 
01:13:46.510 --> 01:13:46.520 align:start position:0%
expanded that 7 to 14 to a little longer
 
01:13:48.550 --> 01:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
in the case of gational diabetes which
 
01:13:50.510 --> 01:13:50.520 align:start position:0%
uh there may be a separate uh piece in
 
01:13:52.350 --> 01:13:52.360 align:start position:0%
here for gational diabetes too I'm not
 
01:13:54.950 --> 01:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
sure it's beyond my expertise I was
 
01:13:57.750 --> 01:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
asked to get a copy of it so I've
 
01:14:01.110 --> 01:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
exhausted my knowledge of
 
01:14:06.750 --> 01:14:06.760 align:start position:0%
yeah okay thank you Peter okay um make a
 
01:14:09.709 --> 01:14:09.719 align:start position:0%

01:14:38.950 --> 01:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
room study seeing none all those in

okay
 
01:14:50.070 --> 01:14:50.080 align:start position:0%
great all right
 
01:14:54.750 --> 01:14:54.760 align:start position:0%
uh let's go into life Insurance relative
 
01:14:58.669 --> 01:14:58.679 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage for living organ
 
01:15:22.189 --> 01:15:22.199 align:start position:0%

bill
[Music]

01:15:49.270 --> 01:15:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:52.350 --> 01:15:52.360 align:start position:0%
can this will this will simply prohibit
 
01:15:53.830 --> 01:15:53.840 align:start position:0%
insurance carriers life insurance
 
01:15:56.430 --> 01:15:56.440 align:start position:0%
carriers from denying you sarily if
 
01:15:58.350 --> 01:15:58.360 align:start position:0%
you've chosen to give a kidney to your
 
01:16:02.310 --> 01:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
brother or sister or or you know tissue
 
01:16:04.709 --> 01:16:04.719 align:start position:0%
donor or I mean or the other criteria
 
01:16:07.149 --> 01:16:07.159 align:start position:0%
set forth
 
01:16:09.350 --> 01:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
here insurance companies actually do
 
01:16:13.669 --> 01:16:13.679 align:start position:0%
this do that yeah anybody here sometimes
 
01:16:16.830 --> 01:16:16.840 align:start position:0%
in certain cases insurance
 
01:16:19.750 --> 01:16:19.760 align:start position:0%
department sh he in housein law legal
 
01:16:21.550 --> 01:16:21.560 align:start position:0%
counsel yes
 
01:16:24.709 --> 01:16:24.719 align:start position:0%
um so well we're talking about life
 
01:16:27.550 --> 01:16:27.560 align:start position:0%
insurance yes there's a lot of things
 
01:16:29.510 --> 01:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
that can be considered that you
 
01:16:31.430 --> 01:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
typically would not be able to consider
 
01:16:34.270 --> 01:16:34.280 align:start position:0%
underwriting fully permitted in in
 
01:16:38.270 --> 01:16:38.280 align:start position:0%
Spades when it comes to so if there's
 
01:16:40.870 --> 01:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
actu statistical information that
 
01:16:42.870 --> 01:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
suggest that had if you're a living
 
01:16:44.629 --> 01:16:44.639 align:start position:0%
donor you know your life expectancy
 
01:16:46.590 --> 01:16:46.600 align:start position:0%
would go down that is one of the things
 
01:16:49.950 --> 01:16:49.960 align:start position:0%
that they can consider um I think what
 
01:16:52.110 --> 01:16:52.120 align:start position:0%
this is trying to do is making sure that
 
01:16:55.510 --> 01:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
they can't deny or cancel
 
01:16:58.149 --> 01:16:58.159 align:start position:0%
um or increase
 
01:16:58.159 --> 01:17:00.310 align:start position:0%
um or increase
premiums

01:17:00.310 --> 01:17:00.320 align:start position:0%
premiums
 
01:17:03.870 --> 01:17:03.880 align:start position:0%
so typically so this is life insurance
 
01:17:05.430 --> 01:17:05.440 align:start position:0%
so life insurance you know you think
 
01:17:07.229 --> 01:17:07.239 align:start position:0%
about it you know in the old days with
 
01:17:08.590 --> 01:17:08.600 align:start position:0%
health insurance you know they would
 
01:17:10.030 --> 01:17:10.040 align:start position:0%
actually do a physical they would you
 
01:17:11.270 --> 01:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
know say we're not going to have any
 
01:17:13.870 --> 01:17:13.880 align:start position:0%
pre-existing conditions okay and we
 
01:17:15.590 --> 01:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
banned that with health insurance but
 
01:17:17.550 --> 01:17:17.560 align:start position:0%
with life insurance said they're very
 
01:17:19.790 --> 01:17:19.800 align:start position:0%
interested in pre-existing conditions
 
01:17:21.510 --> 01:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
they're very interested in all those
 
01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
things and yes the key thing is what
 
01:17:26.189 --> 01:17:26.199 align:start position:0%
she's saying is is that the only if they
 
01:17:28.110 --> 01:17:28.120 align:start position:0%
want to limit something or or you know
 
01:17:30.910 --> 01:17:30.920 align:start position:0%
deny it they have to have uh proof the
 
01:17:33.910 --> 01:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
case of case studies that shows that
 
01:17:37.070 --> 01:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
there has to be actu act evidence St
 
01:17:39.790 --> 01:17:39.800 align:start position:0%
statistical evidence to suggest that
 
01:17:41.709 --> 01:17:41.719 align:start position:0%
this Factor could impact your life
 
01:17:43.669 --> 01:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
expectancy right and it's one of the
 
01:17:47.990 --> 01:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
factors so um where we say deny or
 
01:17:50.830 --> 01:17:50.840 align:start position:0%
cancel coverage there's we wouldn't have
 
01:17:53.790 --> 01:17:53.800 align:start position:0%
an issue with that because
 
01:17:55.629 --> 01:17:55.639 align:start position:0%
what would likely happen is your premium
 
01:17:58.070 --> 01:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
is going to go up um reducing or
 
01:18:01.110 --> 01:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
limiting or making it so you can't
 
01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:02.510 align:start position:0%
limiting or making it so you can't
increase

01:18:02.510 --> 01:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
increase
 
01:18:04.590 --> 01:18:04.600 align:start position:0%
premiums could be a problem for life
 
01:18:05.709 --> 01:18:05.719 align:start position:0%
insurance I'm not going to speak on
 
01:18:08.110 --> 01:18:08.120 align:start position:0%
their behalf but if you were to buy a
 
01:18:10.229 --> 01:18:10.239 align:start position:0%
life insurance policy say when you're 30
 
01:18:12.870 --> 01:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
relatively healthy your premiums are
 
01:18:14.629 --> 01:18:14.639 align:start position:0%
usually depending on the type of policy
 
01:18:16.510 --> 01:18:16.520 align:start position:0%
you know you you could probably expect
 
01:18:18.390 --> 01:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
your premiums to go up as you age
 
01:18:20.310 --> 01:18:20.320 align:start position:0%
because your risk of dying increases as
 
01:18:21.270 --> 01:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
you get
 
01:18:24.229 --> 01:18:24.239 align:start position:0%
older so if you have something that
 
01:18:26.470 --> 01:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
comes up usually they don't underwrite
 
01:18:29.669 --> 01:18:29.679 align:start position:0%
your health again
 
01:18:32.470 --> 01:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
um but I guess if you were on some kind
 
01:18:34.350 --> 01:18:34.360 align:start position:0%
of living donor list that you had and
 
01:18:36.030 --> 01:18:36.040 align:start position:0%
they found out about it that would be a
 
01:18:37.709 --> 01:18:37.719 align:start position:0%
mechanism for them to increase your
 
01:18:40.070 --> 01:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
premium so that's kind of how this works
 
01:18:41.350 --> 01:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
I'm not I wasn't here for the original
 
01:18:42.350 --> 01:18:42.360 align:start position:0%
hearing so I don't know what the
 
01:18:45.070 --> 01:18:45.080 align:start position:0%
testimony was about but um I I'm pretty
 
01:18:47.030 --> 01:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
sure I was scheduling bills so I was out
 
01:18:50.390 --> 01:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
of the room at the time but so but a lot
 
01:18:53.430 --> 01:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
I think a lot of the other um laws we
 
01:18:55.350 --> 01:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
see in other states are prohibiting
 
01:18:58.189 --> 01:18:58.199 align:start position:0%
unfair discrimination but that would not
 
01:19:00.629 --> 01:19:00.639 align:start position:0%
prohibit the insurer from considering
 
01:19:02.470 --> 01:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
this in
 
01:19:04.270 --> 01:19:04.280 align:start position:0%
underwriting right they just can't use
 
01:19:06.310 --> 01:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
it as a sole basis for denying you
 
01:19:08.189 --> 01:19:08.199 align:start position:0%
coverage it just be one of the many
 
01:19:09.750 --> 01:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
factors that can who is encouraging
 
01:19:12.229 --> 01:19:12.239 align:start position:0%
people to to donate or to consider
 
01:19:14.310 --> 01:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
donating be and people are afraid to
 
01:19:16.189 --> 01:19:16.199 align:start position:0%
donate sometimes because they think
 
01:19:17.110 --> 01:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be get life
 
01:19:18.590 --> 01:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
insurance and therefore protect the rest
 
01:19:19.790 --> 01:19:19.800 align:start position:0%
of their family they they need to look
 
01:19:21.910 --> 01:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
at their life insurance plan before they
 
01:19:23.430 --> 01:19:23.440 align:start position:0%
they they decide
 
01:19:25.030 --> 01:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
or they just might be thinking if
 
01:19:26.629 --> 01:19:26.639 align:start position:0%
they're in their 30s they might be
 
01:19:28.070 --> 01:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
thinking well geez I'm at 50 I want life
 
01:19:29.629 --> 01:19:29.639 align:start position:0%
insurance I've got three kids or
 
01:19:33.430 --> 01:19:33.440 align:start position:0%
whatever and if I go give this donation
 
01:19:35.470 --> 01:19:35.480 align:start position:0%
now I may not be able to get it
 
01:19:38.310 --> 01:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
later right so the sponsor I I was
 
01:19:39.510 --> 01:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
looking at the sponsor and I see the
 
01:19:41.229 --> 01:19:41.239 align:start position:0%
speaker of the house here cor I was
 
01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
thinking transportation that that we
 
01:19:45.870 --> 01:19:45.880 align:start position:0%
when we get our when we renew our
 
01:19:48.310 --> 01:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
licenses they always ask whether you
 
01:19:50.830 --> 01:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
want to become a donor an organ donor
 
01:19:53.470 --> 01:19:53.480 align:start position:0%
that's deceased donor right as a
 
01:19:56.110 --> 01:19:56.120 align:start position:0%
deceased owner so that right so this is
 
01:19:58.310 --> 01:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
your your neighbor is life insurance
 
01:19:58.320 --> 01:19:59.149 align:start position:0%
your your neighbor is life insurance
about

01:19:59.149 --> 01:19:59.159 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:20:01.990 --> 01:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
dying in other words could can't say can
 
01:20:05.669 --> 01:20:05.679 align:start position:0%
they say we refuse to give you your your
 
01:20:07.470 --> 01:20:07.480 align:start position:0%
life insurance Your settlement because
 
01:20:11.990 --> 01:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
you you you no no this is a living donor
 
01:20:13.910 --> 01:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
this is this is a living donor a living
 
01:20:15.790 --> 01:20:15.800 align:start position:0%
donor okay so it's you know you're going
 
01:20:17.750 --> 01:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
to be living with one kidney if you gave
 
01:20:20.510 --> 01:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
a kidney to your right relative or a
 
01:20:21.990 --> 01:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
stranger who and that would could
 
01:20:23.950 --> 01:20:23.960 align:start position:0%
potentially affect your longevity and
 
01:20:25.430 --> 01:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
there's there's always a shortage of
 
01:20:28.669 --> 01:20:28.679 align:start position:0%
morgage like we know that and and I'm a
 
01:20:29.709 --> 01:20:29.719 align:start position:0%
little bit familiar with some of the
 
01:20:32.070 --> 01:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
sponsors feelings on this so I won't
 
01:20:34.390 --> 01:20:34.400 align:start position:0%
speak for him but I believe he was the
 
01:20:36.149 --> 01:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
recipient actually I think he testified
 
01:20:39.070 --> 01:20:39.080 align:start position:0%
to that yeah right or yeah or he's quite
 
01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:40.679 align:start position:0%
quite familiar with it okay so the
 
01:20:42.750 --> 01:20:42.760 align:start position:0%
department would be okay you're okay
 
01:20:45.510 --> 01:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
with one tonight or we're okay with
 
01:20:47.350 --> 01:20:47.360 align:start position:0%
whatever you guys want to
 
01:20:50.390 --> 01:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
do the issue is in line 10 we want I
 
01:20:53.030 --> 01:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
want one thing I'm acutely aware when we
 
01:20:54.629 --> 01:20:54.639 align:start position:0%
now when we talk about life insurance
 
01:20:57.470 --> 01:20:57.480 align:start position:0%
and Property and Casualty which is not
 
01:20:59.590 --> 01:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
to confuse with health insurance is one
 
01:21:01.070 --> 01:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
of the things we don't want to be an
 
01:21:03.950 --> 01:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
outlier compared to other states because
 
01:21:06.790 --> 01:21:06.800 align:start position:0%
then our premiums would be higher and we
 
01:21:08.270 --> 01:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
would have less companies less
 
01:21:10.590 --> 01:21:10.600 align:start position:0%
competition in the marketplace so we
 
01:21:12.910 --> 01:21:12.920 align:start position:0%
don't want to be too crazy about how far
 
01:21:15.629 --> 01:21:15.639 align:start position:0%
we go we want to be in the norm of what
 
01:21:18.990 --> 01:21:19.000 align:start position:0%
other states are are doing I believe
 
01:21:21.430 --> 01:21:21.440 align:start position:0%
there's about a handful I think maybe
 
01:21:24.470 --> 01:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
like 10ish States who have passed laws
 
01:21:27.550 --> 01:21:27.560 align:start position:0%
similar to this and they all um focus
 
01:21:30.070 --> 01:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
around prohibiting unfair discrimination
 
01:21:31.870 --> 01:21:31.880 align:start position:0%
against living donors and just to be
 
01:21:33.750 --> 01:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
clear these are people who have actually
 
01:21:36.070 --> 01:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
donated and are still alive not someone
 
01:21:39.709 --> 01:21:39.719 align:start position:0%
who's contemplating donation oh okay and
 
01:21:41.110 --> 01:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
it affects both though I think it
 
01:21:43.430 --> 01:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
affects the size of the likely donor
 
01:21:46.189 --> 01:21:46.199 align:start position:0%
pool if it's on if it comes to your mind
 
01:21:48.110 --> 01:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
that you may impact your ability to be
 
01:21:50.270 --> 01:21:50.280 align:start position:0%
covered in the future and and therefore
 
01:21:51.629 --> 01:21:51.639 align:start position:0%
you know provide that coverage to your
 
01:21:56.669 --> 01:21:56.679 align:start position:0%
family yeah the so but underwriting is
 
01:21:56.679 --> 01:21:57.709 align:start position:0%
family yeah the so but underwriting is
is

01:21:57.709 --> 01:21:57.719 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:22:00.709 --> 01:22:00.719 align:start position:0%
reasonable yeah so in the public hearing
 
01:22:04.310 --> 01:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
got John Hoffman who is he he said he
 
01:22:08.189 --> 01:22:08.199 align:start position:0%
says n n NCO NCO enco does enco have a
 
01:22:09.510 --> 01:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
policy on
 
01:22:13.629 --> 01:22:13.639 align:start position:0%
this I am not sure but en coil is for
 
01:22:16.270 --> 01:22:16.280 align:start position:0%
legislators promoting policy and not
 
01:22:18.629 --> 01:22:18.639 align:start position:0%
necessarily industry so I'm not sure how
 
01:22:20.750 --> 01:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
about neic how about that would be I
 
01:22:22.910 --> 01:22:22.920 align:start position:0%
have not seen anything from neic on this
 
01:22:25.470 --> 01:22:25.480 align:start position:0%
nothing on the Nic yeah and that's
 
01:22:27.350 --> 01:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
that's where we really want to be on
 
01:22:29.629 --> 01:22:29.639 align:start position:0%
same page with because that that really
 
01:22:31.070 --> 01:22:31.080 align:start position:0%
affects our premiums and our
 
01:22:33.750 --> 01:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
competitiveness in our
 
01:22:35.709 --> 01:22:35.719 align:start position:0%
Market well it sounds like we need we
 
01:22:38.270 --> 01:22:38.280 align:start position:0%
need to learn more about this before we
 
01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:39.229 align:start position:0%
need to learn more about this before we
get

01:22:39.229 --> 01:22:39.239 align:start position:0%
get
 
01:22:42.110 --> 01:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
crazy so how about interim study and so
 
01:22:44.270 --> 01:22:44.280 align:start position:0%
we can learn learn more how about we
 
01:22:46.229 --> 01:22:46.239 align:start position:0%
just take out increase the
 
01:22:49.870 --> 01:22:49.880 align:start position:0%
premiums those three words in line
 
01:22:49.880 --> 01:22:51.550 align:start position:0%
premiums those three words in line
10

01:22:51.550 --> 01:22:51.560 align:start position:0%
10
 
01:22:53.910 --> 01:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
uh reduce or limit code so they can
 
01:22:57.550 --> 01:22:57.560 align:start position:0%
still underwrite and and if between the
 
01:22:59.510 --> 01:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
parties the donor and recipient
 
01:23:00.830 --> 01:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
especially if it's
 
01:23:04.470 --> 01:23:04.480 align:start position:0%
familial uh you know I think it's it's
 
01:23:07.229 --> 01:23:07.239 align:start position:0%
possible to overcome that
 
01:23:10.350 --> 01:23:10.360 align:start position:0%
underwriting but I'm not sure we can
 
01:23:13.110 --> 01:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
prohibit underwriting I think there's
 
01:23:15.590 --> 01:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
more to that sentence the reduce or
 
01:23:18.830 --> 01:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
limit or um coverage or benefits or
 
01:23:21.350 --> 01:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
increase usually it's a tradeoff if you
 
01:23:23.470 --> 01:23:23.480 align:start position:0%
don't want your benit it's in or if you
 
01:23:24.669 --> 01:23:24.679 align:start position:0%
don't want your premium increased then
 
01:23:26.149 --> 01:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to agree to take a
 
01:23:28.629 --> 01:23:28.639 align:start position:0%
lower amount of benefits so it would
 
01:23:32.950 --> 01:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit different um but
 
01:23:36.070 --> 01:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
again I don't know enough about it to to
 
01:23:38.189 --> 01:23:38.199 align:start position:0%
say too much more beyond that but I
 
01:23:40.110 --> 01:23:40.120 align:start position:0%
would say just taking out the increas in
 
01:23:41.470 --> 01:23:41.480 align:start position:0%
premiums is not going to necessarily
 
01:23:43.110 --> 01:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
well you take out the whole paragraph
 
01:23:44.110 --> 01:23:44.120 align:start position:0%
you take the whole you take out the
 
01:23:45.470 --> 01:23:45.480 align:start position:0%
whole paragraph and that's okay so let's
 
01:23:47.910 --> 01:23:47.920 align:start position:0%
see where we leave uh preclude a covered
 
01:23:49.629 --> 01:23:49.639 align:start position:0%
person from donating all or part of an
 
01:23:51.910 --> 01:23:51.920 align:start position:0%
organ as a condition of receiving or
 
01:24:00.790 --> 01:24:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:04.510 --> 01:24:04.520 align:start position:0%
her so that's kidneys right because that
 
01:24:06.430 --> 01:24:06.440 align:start position:0%
you you give
 
01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:09.390 align:start position:0%
you you give
part

01:24:09.390 --> 01:24:09.400 align:start position:0%
part
 
01:24:16.229 --> 01:24:16.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:18.830 --> 01:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
there you get liver part of your liver
 
01:24:21.350 --> 01:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
right they do
 
01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:23.709 align:start position:0%
right they do
that

01:24:23.709 --> 01:24:23.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:24:25.390 --> 01:24:25.400 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
01:24:28.990 --> 01:24:29.000 align:start position:0%
you how many lawyers do we have in the
 
01:24:31.149 --> 01:24:31.159 align:start position:0%
room any other paragraph you would want
 
01:24:34.790 --> 01:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
to remove what what anything
 
01:24:37.390 --> 01:24:37.400 align:start position:0%
else I mean I again I don't I don't want
 
01:24:39.310 --> 01:24:39.320 align:start position:0%
to be too off the reservation when it
 
01:24:41.750 --> 01:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
comes to other states and passing this
 
01:24:44.990 --> 01:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
legislation do you want more time to
 
01:24:46.870 --> 01:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean if you want to think about
 
01:24:48.430 --> 01:24:48.440 align:start position:0%
how we can Tinker with this I can take
 
01:24:49.590 --> 01:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
it back and do a little bit more
 
01:24:52.550 --> 01:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
research on it I know that what I'm not
 
01:24:54.149 --> 01:24:54.159 align:start position:0%
seeing here which I did see in a lot of
 
01:24:56.910 --> 01:24:56.920 align:start position:0%
the other ones was the phrase the unfair
 
01:24:59.550 --> 01:24:59.560 align:start position:0%
discrimination so I'd want to see if
 
01:25:02.070 --> 01:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
that's something that we want to put in
 
01:25:04.430 --> 01:25:04.440 align:start position:0%
okay ah right so you want to use more
 
01:25:06.950 --> 01:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
language that other states have used yes
 
01:25:09.310 --> 01:25:09.320 align:start position:0%
so um I can take it back and look at
 
01:25:10.870 --> 01:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
some other stat yeah we don't have to
 
01:25:14.629 --> 01:25:14.639 align:start position:0%
take action on this yet so 19 States
 
01:25:18.310 --> 01:25:18.320 align:start position:0%
according to quick quick research okay
 
01:25:20.390 --> 01:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
but I would caveat that that it's not
 
01:25:23.750 --> 01:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
the same bill in all 19 so be very
 
01:25:26.270 --> 01:25:26.280 align:start position:0%
different in what has actually passed
 
01:25:27.950 --> 01:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
but 19 have something and three have
 
01:25:30.510 --> 01:25:30.520 align:start position:0%
pending okay we're going to
 
01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:33.189 align:start position:0%
pending okay we're going to
reschedule

01:25:33.189 --> 01:25:33.199 align:start position:0%
reschedule
 
01:25:35.709 --> 01:25:35.719 align:start position:0%
and uh wait for the Department to come
 
01:25:40.709 --> 01:25:40.719 align:start position:0%
up with a a standard standard language
 
01:25:43.109 --> 01:25:43.119 align:start position:0%
for yes that would be more in line with
 
01:25:45.070 --> 01:25:45.080 align:start position:0%
what the majority of States done very
 
01:25:45.080 --> 01:25:47.350 align:start position:0%
what the majority of States done very
important

01:25:47.350 --> 01:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:25:51.310 --> 01:25:51.320 align:start position:0%
okay is everybody okay with that yeah
 
01:25:53.709 --> 01:25:53.719 align:start position:0%
all right great
 
01:25:55.910 --> 01:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
okay relative to contracts between
 
01:25:58.310 --> 01:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
Public Adjusters and the insured didn't
 
01:25:59.470 --> 01:25:59.480 align:start position:0%
didn't I thought we were going to take
 
01:25:59.480 --> 01:26:01.669 align:start position:0%
didn't I thought we were going to take
care

01:26:01.669 --> 01:26:01.679 align:start position:0%
care
 
01:26:04.350 --> 01:26:04.360 align:start position:0%
of then we we're going to dispose of
 
01:26:07.550 --> 01:26:07.560 align:start position:0%
this who anybody here for this bill
 
01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:09.910 align:start position:0%
this who anybody here for this bill
where's

01:26:09.910 --> 01:26:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:12.270 --> 01:26:12.280 align:start position:0%
George what happened to Henry what
 
01:26:14.030 --> 01:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
happened to all the lobbyists for this
 
01:26:16.910 --> 01:26:16.920 align:start position:0%
bill the insurance department recommends
 
01:26:21.149 --> 01:26:21.159 align:start position:0%
itl to enable further review yeah okay
 
01:26:23.229 --> 01:26:23.239 align:start position:0%
yeah that's what we want
 
01:26:25.430 --> 01:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
okay I can confirm that all right
 
01:26:30.390 --> 01:26:30.400 align:start position:0%
