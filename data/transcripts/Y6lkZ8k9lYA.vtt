representatives
 
00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:22.950 align:start position:0%
representatives
[Laughter]

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much folks um let me
 
00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
start out and then we can get into some
 
00:20:29.669 --> 00:20:29.679 align:start position:0%
discussion on this there are very few
 
00:20:29.679 --> 00:20:30.710 align:start position:0%
discussion on this there are very few
places

00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
places
 
00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
in this particular legislation where
 
00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
there's much
 
00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
difference at all from the two versions
 
00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
so we should be able to handle this
 
00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:38.470 align:start position:0%
so we should be able to handle this
quickly

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:38.480 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
but what we have noticed is that
 
00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
there and one of the primary reasons why
 
00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
the house has said we'd like to sit down
 
00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:49.360 align:start position:0%
and discuss this is that
 
00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
there's also a reference to a criteria
 
00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
for inadequate education
 
00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
in sb 148
 
00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
and where we're modifying places where
 
00:21:01.669 --> 00:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with criteria for
 
00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
inadequate education here
 
00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
we ought to try and get ourselves on the
 
00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
same page on both those bills so we
 
00:21:08.789 --> 00:21:08.799 align:start position:0%
don't have one bill saying one thing
 
00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
another bill saying another
 
00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
so that that's the rationale for i
 
00:21:14.789 --> 00:21:14.799 align:start position:0%
believe for
 
00:21:18.149 --> 00:21:18.159 align:start position:0%
us coming forward uh and saying we we
 
00:21:23.669 --> 00:21:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
so we let's address the first thing
 
00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
where the one difference
 
00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
is there any problem with house members
 
00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
here in terms of
 
00:21:36.149 --> 00:21:36.159 align:start position:0%
what the the senate did on page four uh
 
00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
school shall accept
 
00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
credits required for high school
 
00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
graduation consistent with rules adopted
 
00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
by the state board of education
 
00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
pursuant to our 541a relative to the
 
00:21:47.669 --> 00:21:47.679 align:start position:0%
approval alternative programs for
 
00:21:50.789 --> 00:21:50.799 align:start position:0%
granting credit leading to graduation
 
00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:52.240 align:start position:0%
i don't we don't have a problem with
 
00:21:54.549 --> 00:21:54.559 align:start position:0%
that so the issue
 
00:21:58.549 --> 00:21:58.559 align:start position:0%
apparently senator ward does the senate
 
00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
have any other issues other than what
 
00:22:02.149 --> 00:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
maybe we have with the criteria for an
 
00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
adequate education which we should mesh
 
00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
okay then so if we can look at the
 
00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
latter part of this bill where we talk
 
00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:21.440 align:start position:0%
about the criteria for inadequate
 
00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:24.390 align:start position:0%
about the criteria for inadequate
education

00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
and let's see uh find out where that is
 
00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:29.590 align:start position:0%
and let's see uh find out where that is
here

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
maybe it's the front side big one starts
 
00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:37.360 align:start position:0%
yeah page one starts i don't believe um
 
00:22:38.789 --> 00:22:38.799 align:start position:0%
well that's where we're in the criteria
 
00:22:44.149 --> 00:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
on on page two at the top
 
00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:50.720 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with now to biological
 
00:22:52.789 --> 00:22:52.799 align:start position:0%
fiscal and earth sciences to enable them
 
00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
to understand and appreciate
 
00:22:57.669 --> 00:22:57.679 align:start position:0%
the world and it's around them now we've
 
00:22:59.149 --> 00:22:59.159 align:start position:0%
added in and the engineering
 
00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
socioeconomic and geopolitical
 
00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
challenges around them with the students
 
00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
which we just went through
 
00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:21.029 --> 00:23:21.039 align:start position:0%
it reads as follows in 148
 
00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
knowledge of the biological fiscal and
 
00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
earth sciences
 
00:23:27.909 --> 00:23:27.919 align:start position:0%
including environmental sciences that
 
00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
investigate the complex interaction of
 
00:23:31.669 --> 00:23:31.679 align:start position:0%
physical chemical and biological
 
00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:33.200 align:start position:0%
processes that take place
 
00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
on the earth to enable them to
 
00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:37.360 align:start position:0%
understand and appreciate the world
 
00:23:39.029 --> 00:23:39.039 align:start position:0%
and the end and the engineering
 
00:23:40.789 --> 00:23:40.799 align:start position:0%
socioeconomic and geopolitical
 
00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
challenges around them
 
00:23:46.149 --> 00:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
so we added in from language
 
00:23:50.149 --> 00:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
which is in 148 um
 
00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:52.720 align:start position:0%
we should i say add that into this so
 
00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
that they're two
 
00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
no i was just going to take the amending
 
00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
language for these
 
00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
three areas which we have right here
 
00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
right in 148 and
 
00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:14.720 align:start position:0%
put those in if everybody agreed
 
00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:34.789 --> 00:24:34.799 align:start position:0%
yeah i have a copy i don't know
 
00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
i think those were handed out the other
 
00:24:38.789 --> 00:24:38.799 align:start position:0%
day when we were in we weren't with us
 
00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
no it wasn't that's so i was is there a
 
00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
way that we can combine these all into
 
00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:47.200 align:start position:0%
one document to look at versus
 
00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
he's doing this together because i'm not
 
00:24:50.789 --> 00:24:50.799 align:start position:0%
going to sign off on anything
 
00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:52.480 align:start position:0%
but i can't see it all in one place well
 
00:24:53.909 --> 00:24:53.919 align:start position:0%
it's all administrated here
 
00:24:56.149 --> 00:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
but it's not in the form it's not in the
 
00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
form of an amendment right no
 
00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:58.549 align:start position:0%
form of an amendment right no
respectfully

00:24:58.549 --> 00:24:58.559 align:start position:0%
respectfully
 
00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:20.070 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
right this was a side by side comparing
 
00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:23.510 align:start position:0%
right this was a side by side comparing
um

00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:26.789 --> 00:25:26.799 align:start position:0%
hb 242 and 140 yeah yeah
 
00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
right yeah yeah it's the one that it was
 
00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:30.320 align:start position:0%
passed out
 
00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
yesterday or monday
 
00:25:35.269 --> 00:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
was it monday morning oh yeah monday
 
00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:43.029 --> 00:25:43.039 align:start position:0%
our minds oh just so you know
 
00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
while we're waiting for that i do want
 
00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:46.400 align:start position:0%
to talk about something that's in
 
00:25:49.909 --> 00:25:49.919 align:start position:0%
uh 242 that i had a in discussions with
 
00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
department of education i had a
 
00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:52.720 align:start position:0%
difficult time
 
00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
putting a number to it because it's
 
00:25:57.909 --> 00:25:57.919 align:start position:0%
a little bit unclear so we can either
 
00:25:59.830 --> 00:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
address it now or we can address it
 
00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:01.720 align:start position:0%
next year um
 
00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:03.269 align:start position:0%
next year um

under c it says uh an additional

disparity achievement proficiency aid
 
00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:25.110 align:start position:0%
disparity achievement proficiency aid
grant

00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
grant
 
00:26:26.549 --> 00:26:26.559 align:start position:0%
shall be provided to eligible school
 
00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
districts and schools and charter
 
00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:29.200 align:start position:0%
schools and
 
00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
to improve academic achievement and
 
00:26:32.789 --> 00:26:32.799 align:start position:0%
growth of level one and level two
 
00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
proficiency students
 
00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
so in discussions with department of
 
00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:38.230 align:start position:0%
so in discussions with department of
education

00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:38.240 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
um it they don't know
 
00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:44.480 align:start position:0%
what grade level that would be or is it
 
00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
every grade level
 
00:26:48.149 --> 00:26:48.159 align:start position:0%
and if it's every grade level is it
 
00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
every test so is it
 
00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:52.720 align:start position:0%
a student who achieves a one or two in
 
00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
math or
 
00:26:55.269 --> 00:26:55.279 align:start position:0%
i don't know every topic that they would
 
00:26:56.789 --> 00:26:56.799 align:start position:0%
achieve a one or two in
 
00:26:58.470 --> 00:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
so i think we just need to provide a lot
 
00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
more clarity on
 
00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:02.720 align:start position:0%
what this additional grant would be so i
 
00:27:04.549 --> 00:27:04.559 align:start position:0%
in attempting to include it in the
 
00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:06.640 align:start position:0%
funding this year i was
 
00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:08.480 align:start position:0%
unable to include it in the funding even
 
00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
though it doesn't have to be included
 
00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:10.230 align:start position:0%
though it doesn't have to be included
yet

00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:10.240 align:start position:0%
yet
 
00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
um okay let me try to explain there's
 
00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
two areas
 
00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
that are not part of adequacy here yeah
 
00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
the first part it deals with the
 
00:27:22.149 --> 00:27:22.159 align:start position:0%
equalized valuation per pupil
 
00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
which is the physical past disparity
 
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.070 align:start position:0%
which is the physical past disparity
eight

00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
eight
 
00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:29.200 align:start position:0%
and that was a scaled down ratcheted
 
00:27:32.149 --> 00:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
formula depending upon where you go from
 
00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
the lowest
 
00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:35.120 align:start position:0%
let's say property valuation for people
 
00:27:36.389 --> 00:27:36.399 align:start position:0%
maybe around 350
 
00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
000 the highest might range up to
 
00:27:41.909 --> 00:27:41.919 align:start position:0%
seven million dollars per pupil like a
 
00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
wealthy community like molten girl
 
00:27:48.789 --> 00:27:48.799 align:start position:0%
um then from about a million point one
 
00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:51.440 align:start position:0%
down to the 350 there was a sliding
 
00:27:53.669 --> 00:27:53.679 align:start position:0%
scale whereas the closer you got the 350
 
00:27:54.789 --> 00:27:54.799 align:start position:0%
the more money you got
 
00:27:58.149 --> 00:27:58.159 align:start position:0%
per pupil for this disparity aid
 
00:28:00.789 --> 00:28:00.799 align:start position:0%
that's a formula that's been driven from
 
00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
both the concept wise from
 
00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:05.480 align:start position:0%
uh the last study commission we had the
 
00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:06.710 align:start position:0%
uh the last study commission we had the
2018

00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
2018
 
00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
task force which we had on studying
 
00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:10.230 align:start position:0%
task force which we had on studying
school

00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:10.240 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:28:13.669 --> 00:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
aid the second part
 
00:28:16.789 --> 00:28:16.799 align:start position:0%
was a concern that if i am a
 
00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:20.720 align:start position:0%
community which has a tax base
 
00:28:23.269 --> 00:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
or a equalized property valuations well
 
00:28:25.669 --> 00:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
above that 1.1 million dollars
 
00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:28.240 align:start position:0%
but i have these large groups of
 
00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:28.950 align:start position:0%
but i have these large groups of
students

00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:32.240 align:start position:0%
within to have the needs for
 
00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:35.360 align:start position:0%
remediation it could be a
 
00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
particular subgroup as we oftentimes see
 
00:28:39.909 --> 00:28:39.919 align:start position:0%
in our proficiency testing
 
00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:42.240 align:start position:0%
how do we help those students as well
 
00:28:43.669 --> 00:28:43.679 align:start position:0%
the concept was
 
00:28:45.909 --> 00:28:45.919 align:start position:0%
that if you had a large percentage of
 
00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:47.360 align:start position:0%
those like a 48
 
00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
free and reduced or something such as
 
00:28:50.789 --> 00:28:50.799 align:start position:0%
that there would be money available
 
00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
there um the concept was we'd look at
 
00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
title 1 scores
 
00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
that wasn't available so what we opted
 
00:28:58.710 --> 00:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
to do
 
00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
with working with ue at that moment was
 
00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:02.720 align:start position:0%
to look at the
 
00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:05.360 align:start position:0%
the results of the achievements testing
 
00:29:07.029 --> 00:29:07.039 align:start position:0%
that was done in the schools
 
00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:09.200 align:start position:0%
and one in two are those areas which are
 
00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:10.720 align:start position:0%
below proficiency
 
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
three and four are at proficiency far
 
00:29:15.269 --> 00:29:15.279 align:start position:0%
above proficiency
 
00:29:17.269 --> 00:29:17.279 align:start position:0%
and so we take the number of students in
 
00:29:19.029 --> 00:29:19.039 align:start position:0%
the categories one and two
 
00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
and see what they are so they may
 
00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
receive that additional support
 
00:29:26.549 --> 00:29:26.559 align:start position:0%
i know it's not clear and whether
 
00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
our testing starts to create three so it
 
00:29:30.549 --> 00:29:30.559 align:start position:0%
does not include grades
 
00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
k through two that's not stated here
 
00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
and maybe something that at this point
 
00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
in time
 
00:29:39.029 --> 00:29:39.039 align:start position:0%
we may not want to have that in this
 
00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:40.720 align:start position:0%
particular lifestyle we can take that
 
00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
line out
 
00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
and address that through future
 
00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
legislation in the
 
00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
in the next round this year or we could
 
00:29:50.549 --> 00:29:50.559 align:start position:0%
leave it in and clarify it
 
00:29:52.389 --> 00:29:52.399 align:start position:0%
and maybe this isn't the time to do it
 
00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
maybe that's we should
 
00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:56.720 align:start position:0%
take it out but just so you know for the
 
00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:57.430 align:start position:0%
take it out but just so you know for the
funding

00:29:57.430 --> 00:29:57.440 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:30:00.549 --> 00:30:00.559 align:start position:0%
and i know that this was not
 
00:30:02.549 --> 00:30:02.559 align:start position:0%
the date of the implementation of this
 
00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
it was not
 
00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
for this next biennium but
 
00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
the fiscal disparity aid we used a
 
00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
different formula we used the free and
 
00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:11.200 align:start position:0%
reduced one
 
00:30:13.669 --> 00:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
because that's right there was a there's
 
00:30:15.269 --> 00:30:15.279 align:start position:0%
some issues that i had found with the
 
00:30:16.389 --> 00:30:16.399 align:start position:0%
fiscal disparity
 
00:30:18.789 --> 00:30:18.799 align:start position:0%
that it didn't necessarily go to the
 
00:30:18.799 --> 00:30:19.669 align:start position:0%
that it didn't necessarily go to the
towns

00:30:19.669 --> 00:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
towns
 
00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
to the school districts that actually
 
00:30:23.269 --> 00:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
needed it the most
 
00:30:25.029 --> 00:30:25.039 align:start position:0%
sometimes there was a lot of wealthy
 
00:30:25.039 --> 00:30:26.389 align:start position:0%
sometimes there was a lot of wealthy
communities

00:30:26.389 --> 00:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
communities
 
00:30:27.910 --> 00:30:27.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps in the lakes region
 
00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:29.430 align:start position:0%
perhaps in the lakes region
[Laughter]

00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:32.320 align:start position:0%
that were receiving it or um down south
 
00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
that were receiving it
 
00:30:36.549 --> 00:30:36.559 align:start position:0%
um even though they had uh average
 
00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
household incomes well over a hundred
 
00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
00:30:41.909 --> 00:30:41.919 align:start position:0%
but they just had a lot of kids and so
 
00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:44.240 align:start position:0%
they would receive fiscal disparity
 
00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
where a community that had average
 
00:30:47.909 --> 00:30:47.919 align:start position:0%
household income less than forty
 
00:30:49.669 --> 00:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars that
 
00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
seeing fewer and fewer kids come to
 
00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
school didn't actually receive fiscal
 
00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:54.149 align:start position:0%
school didn't actually receive fiscal
disparity

00:30:54.149 --> 00:30:54.159 align:start position:0%
disparity
 
00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
so that's that's the problem i solved
 
00:30:57.509 --> 00:30:57.519 align:start position:0%
that so but
 
00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
so just that whole section c although i
 
00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:02.840 align:start position:0%
really want to continue to address this
 
00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:05.360 align:start position:0%
issue it wasn't included in the budget
 
00:31:09.029 --> 00:31:09.039 align:start position:0%
when we when we um looked at this
 
00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
we had another bill that came forward to
 
00:31:13.269 --> 00:31:13.279 align:start position:0%
us what was the number that 608
 
00:31:17.269 --> 00:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
608 yes hb 608 we had this formula
 
00:31:22.149 --> 00:31:22.159 align:start position:0%
in there um we just flat ran out of time
 
00:31:24.149 --> 00:31:24.159 align:start position:0%
and could not address the issue i know
 
00:31:25.509 --> 00:31:25.519 align:start position:0%
the issue you're dealing with
 
00:31:28.389 --> 00:31:28.399 align:start position:0%
in your legislation your mental language
 
00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:31.360 align:start position:0%
which for a halo that'd be wonderful
 
00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:34.240 align:start position:0%
and for many towns which are having
 
00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
these disparity issues
 
00:31:38.549 --> 00:31:38.559 align:start position:0%
where you know if you're at the 48
 
00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
percent or higher therebus roughly
 
00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:41.360 align:start position:0%
around 600
 
00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
per pupil and then it ratchets down as
 
00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:45.440 align:start position:0%
you get down to 12
 
00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
we've had that formula built in that was
 
00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
a formula which was similar to what we
 
00:31:52.389 --> 00:31:52.399 align:start position:0%
had in 2008 2009
 
00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
which came out of that original
 
00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
commission which we had physical
 
00:31:57.669 --> 00:31:57.679 align:start position:0%
capacity disparity eight
 
00:32:01.269 --> 00:32:01.279 align:start position:0%
based on that premise 2018
 
00:32:04.149 --> 00:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
chaired by representative umberger uh we
 
00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:06.640 align:start position:0%
went to the equities valuation per pupil
 
00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
that's glenn was on that i was on that
 
00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:10.070 align:start position:0%
that's glenn was on that i was on that
um

00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:11.909 --> 00:32:11.919 align:start position:0%
and then we looked at that again with
 
00:32:13.669 --> 00:32:13.679 align:start position:0%
the study commission we had just
 
00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal capacity disparity aid is
 
00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
separate from adequacy and needed
 
00:32:29.909 --> 00:32:29.919 align:start position:0%
how we derive that is the issue and i
 
00:32:32.389 --> 00:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
think that needs further discussion
 
00:32:34.549 --> 00:32:34.559 align:start position:0%
so what you might want to do aaron on
 
00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
this is that
 
00:32:38.149 --> 00:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
where we say the cost of fiscal capacity
 
00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
severity is a separate grant
 
00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
from adequacy i might stop it right
 
00:32:43.909 --> 00:32:43.919 align:start position:0%
there okay
 
00:32:47.110 --> 00:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
and let the people on you know the
 
00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
policy and finance come to be together
 
00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
hopefully in some kind of a
 
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
a subgroup of the navy that finance in
 
00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:55.750 align:start position:0%
a subgroup of the navy that finance in
the

00:32:55.750 --> 00:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:32:58.789 --> 00:32:58.799 align:start position:0%
policy committees and work this out um
 
00:33:01.509 --> 00:33:01.519 align:start position:0%
it's a huge issue i would hope we could
 
00:33:02.149 --> 00:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
address that
 
00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
in the second year of this biennium and
 
00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
get this behind us and get on with the
 
00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
world when this thing goes into effect
 
00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:10.720 align:start position:0%
okay so do you are you in favor then of
 
00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:11.990 align:start position:0%
okay so do you are you in favor then of
deleting

00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
deleting
 
00:33:14.389 --> 00:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
from and to the period at the end of
 
00:33:14.399 --> 00:33:15.029 align:start position:0%
from and to the period at the end of
that

00:33:15.029 --> 00:33:15.039 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
yes yes
 
00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:24.640 align:start position:0%
so could it be the cost of fiscal
 
00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:26.389 align:start position:0%
so could it be the cost of fiscal
disparity

00:33:26.389 --> 00:33:26.399 align:start position:0%
disparity
 
00:33:28.549 --> 00:33:28.559 align:start position:0%
it would there the sentence would be the
 
00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
cost of fiscal the capacity disparity
 
00:33:49.509 --> 00:33:49.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
we're just anxious to see physical
 
00:33:52.549 --> 00:33:52.559 align:start position:0%
capacity disparity
 
00:33:55.669 --> 00:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
placed in this budget somewhere somehow
 
00:33:57.269 --> 00:33:57.279 align:start position:0%
it's going to help all the communities
 
00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:06.230 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
are there any other areas that you can
 
00:34:09.909 --> 00:34:09.919 align:start position:0%
get back to the criteria
 
00:34:13.109 --> 00:34:13.119 align:start position:0%
uh parts and what we could do then if we
 
00:34:14.869 --> 00:34:14.879 align:start position:0%
can resolve this we could take a
 
00:34:18.829 --> 00:34:18.839 align:start position:0%
break and get this amendment quickly
 
00:34:18.839 --> 00:34:19.990 align:start position:0%
break and get this amendment quickly
made

00:34:19.990 --> 00:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
made
 
00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:23.200 align:start position:0%
um so the other
 
00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:31.990 --> 00:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
did everybody get a copy of the sheet
 
00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:32.550 align:start position:0%
did everybody get a copy of the sheet
that

00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:32.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:34:36.069 --> 00:34:36.079 align:start position:0%
jen just brought down the 242
 
00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:39.200 align:start position:0%
and 142 um
 
00:34:44.470 --> 00:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:46.389 --> 00:34:46.399 align:start position:0%
at the first change there versus
 
00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
knowledge of the biological physical and
 
00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:50.240 align:start position:0%
earth sciences etc
 
00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
that is what we have discussed
 
00:34:59.510 --> 00:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
i would like to see that replace
 
00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
on sb hb
 
00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
242 that section that criteria for an
 
00:35:11.109 --> 00:35:11.119 align:start position:0%
adequate education that
 
00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:14.720 align:start position:0%
particular section that's the first
 
00:35:17.349 --> 00:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
thing we have to do
 
00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
which we have there on
 
00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:36.560 align:start position:0%
sb 148 criteria on the bottom of page
 
00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:38.550 align:start position:0%
sb 148 criteria on the bottom of page
one

00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:38.560 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:40.480 align:start position:0%
currently you can see what's in law
 
00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
which is not the highlighted or the bold
 
00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
the change with sound wellness and
 
00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
environmental practices
 
00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:50.800 align:start position:0%
including outdoor recreation to enable
 
00:35:54.069 --> 00:35:54.079 align:start position:0%
them to enhance their own well-being
 
00:35:57.430 --> 00:35:57.440 align:start position:0%
as well as that of others
 
00:35:59.910 --> 00:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
there's a driver for this and outdoor
 
00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
recreation is
 
00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
uh one that the career technical
 
00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:05.030 align:start position:0%
uh one that the career technical
education

00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
centers are trying to get into and and
 
00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
have support through adequacy
 
00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
for what they are doing to prepare
 
00:36:13.990 --> 00:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
people for
 
00:36:17.109 --> 00:36:17.119 align:start position:0%
jobs in that tourism recreation industry
 
00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:26.470 --> 00:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
and the last area which would be changed
 
00:36:29.349 --> 00:36:29.359 align:start position:0%
would be the romans 7 which is on the
 
00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
backside of that sheet that
 
00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
genders brought down to us which was for
 
00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:34.710 align:start position:0%
genders brought down to us which was for
changing

00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:34.720 align:start position:0%
changing
 
00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
romans 7 of the criteria for inadequate
 
00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:38.710 align:start position:0%
romans 7 of the criteria for inadequate
education

00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:38.720 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:41.200 align:start position:0%
to incorporate what the senate had
 
00:36:43.349 --> 00:36:43.359 align:start position:0%
proposed in 148
 
00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
skills for lifelong learning including
 
00:36:46.870 --> 00:36:46.880 align:start position:0%
interpersonal and technical
 
00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
technological skills to enable them
 
00:36:53.109 --> 00:36:53.119 align:start position:0%
to work learn work communicate and
 
00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
participate effectively
 
00:36:58.870 --> 00:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
in changing society and environment
 
00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
we have we would like to propose that
 
00:37:11.349 --> 00:37:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:20.829 --> 00:37:20.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:20.839 --> 00:37:24.470 align:start position:0%
 
148

00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:28.069 --> 00:37:28.079 align:start position:0%
to read us as i have right here
 
00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
if you're looking at romans 7 it says
 
00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:32.640 align:start position:0%
skills for lifelong learning
 
00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:35.680 align:start position:0%
including interpersonal
 
00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
we'd like to add in their environmental
 
00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:40.390 align:start position:0%
we'd like to add in their environmental
education

00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
and technical skills getting back to
 
00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
what you have there
 
00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
to enable them to learn work
 
00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:52.720 align:start position:0%
communicate and participate effectively
 
00:37:57.670 --> 00:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
in a changing society and environment
 
00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
so what was you know we're proposing is
 
00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:04.160 align:start position:0%
that we also add in
 
00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
the word environmental education
 
00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:18.720 align:start position:0%
and that will line up with 148 which
 
00:38:19.349 --> 00:38:19.359 align:start position:0%
then has
 
00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:23.200 align:start position:0%
the following two paragraphs in 148
 
00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
which deal with the director of career
 
00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
technical education which came in from
 
00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:28.640 align:start position:0%
the devices senate version
 
00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
and also incorporates part six of the
 
00:38:32.069 --> 00:38:32.079 align:start position:0%
senate version
 
00:38:35.109 --> 00:38:35.119 align:start position:0%
148 that will remain in 148
 
00:38:37.349 --> 00:38:37.359 align:start position:0%
not in what we're doing today so what
 
00:38:39.349 --> 00:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
we're doing is we're melding
 
00:38:41.829 --> 00:38:41.839 align:start position:0%
what the senate has put forward and
 
00:38:41.839 --> 00:38:43.829 align:start position:0%
what the senate has put forward and
these

00:38:43.829 --> 00:38:43.839 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
small changes to incorporate the
 
00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
outdoor recreation and environmental
 
00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:50.230 align:start position:0%
outdoor recreation and environmental
issues

00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:50.240 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:38:52.310 --> 00:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
that we need to be emphasizing our
 
00:38:56.310 --> 00:38:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
so what i should do then uh
 
00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
madam chair is to um get an amendment
 
00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:18.470 align:start position:0%
madam chair is to um get an amendment
made

00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
made
 
00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
we should take a break are we around for

so let's get into hb 278 here
 
01:18:04.630 --> 01:18:04.640 align:start position:0%
we all have a side by side in front of
 
01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:05.430 align:start position:0%
we all have a side by side in front of
us

01:18:05.430 --> 01:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:18:09.669 --> 01:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
it appears to me that everything beyond
 
01:18:12.790 --> 01:18:12.800 align:start position:0%
the first page is pretty much agreed
 
01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:14.070 align:start position:0%
the first page is pretty much agreed
upon

01:18:14.070 --> 01:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
upon
 
01:18:17.270 --> 01:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
by the senate and the house version so
 
01:18:20.870 --> 01:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:24.830 --> 01:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
part one of this which deals with unused
 
01:18:27.270 --> 01:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
facilities and we're looking at the
 
01:18:29.590 --> 01:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
second part there which deals with
 
01:18:34.229 --> 01:18:34.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:38.310 --> 01:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
2021 verse 2022
 
01:18:39.990 --> 01:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
so let's open this up first for a
 
01:18:41.510 --> 01:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
discussion regarding
 
01:18:44.790 --> 01:18:44.800 align:start position:0%
part one folks
 
01:18:46.950 --> 01:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
anybody who would like to discuss this
 
01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:49.270 align:start position:0%
anybody who would like to discuss this
sure

01:18:49.270 --> 01:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:52.390 --> 01:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
so um so i think uh
 
01:18:54.790 --> 01:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
it's important for everyone to keep in
 
01:18:58.790 --> 01:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:02.470 --> 01:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
this list that would be maintained by
 
01:19:05.990 --> 01:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:09.350 --> 01:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
is is really nothing but a
 
01:19:12.390 --> 01:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
record keeper gatekeeper type
 
01:19:15.750 --> 01:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
um situation it doesn't require
 
01:19:19.189 --> 01:19:19.199 align:start position:0%
any action to take place it's merely a
 
01:19:23.669 --> 01:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
holding spot for the names of of schools
 
01:19:26.950 --> 01:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
um and there is always the
 
01:19:30.070 --> 01:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
it's also important to to keep in mind
 
01:19:33.910 --> 01:19:33.920 align:start position:0%
that there is the opportunity for any
 
01:19:35.510 --> 01:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
school district
 
01:19:39.990 --> 01:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
to stay off that list
 
01:19:43.030 --> 01:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
by having a school board approved
 
01:19:46.070 --> 01:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
plan for using
 
01:19:48.310 --> 01:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
that that building i would like to say
 
01:19:50.229 --> 01:19:50.239 align:start position:0%
for academic purposes
 
01:19:52.149 --> 01:19:52.159 align:start position:0%
um and that may also be part of the
 
01:19:52.159 --> 01:19:53.350 align:start position:0%
um and that may also be part of the
discussion

01:19:53.350 --> 01:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:19:56.390 --> 01:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
but um but really
 
01:19:59.430 --> 01:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
it still comes down to the fact that um
 
01:20:02.830 --> 01:20:02.840 align:start position:0%
being on this list of quote unquote
 
01:20:05.430 --> 01:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
unused facilities
 
01:20:09.110 --> 01:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't obligate or trigger
 
01:20:12.629 --> 01:20:12.639 align:start position:0%
anything um it's it's merely a
 
01:20:17.590 --> 01:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
a uh i don't know a gatekeeper's list of
 
01:20:22.390 --> 01:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:25.430 --> 01:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
open to having a dialogue with a charter
 
01:20:27.830 --> 01:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
school that needs that space
 
01:20:29.750 --> 01:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
i also think it's important that we lay
 
01:20:32.790 --> 01:20:32.800 align:start position:0%
on the table the idea that
 
01:20:35.110 --> 01:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
these schools are very expensive to
 
01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:36.709 align:start position:0%
these schools are very expensive to
build

01:20:36.709 --> 01:20:36.719 align:start position:0%
build
 
01:20:40.149 --> 01:20:40.159 align:start position:0%
and and they are built for a purpose and
 
01:20:42.149 --> 01:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
the purpose is
 
01:20:44.830 --> 01:20:44.840 align:start position:0%
generally thought of to be academic
 
01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:47.510 align:start position:0%
generally thought of to be academic
instruction

01:20:47.510 --> 01:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
instruction
 
01:20:50.470 --> 01:20:50.480 align:start position:0%
it doesn't seem to make sense to me to
 
01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:51.430 align:start position:0%
it doesn't seem to make sense to me to
have

01:20:51.430 --> 01:20:51.440 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:20:53.510 --> 01:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
two different types of public school
 
01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:54.629 align:start position:0%
two different types of public school
students

01:20:54.629 --> 01:20:54.639 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:20:57.830 --> 01:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
one able to use these dedicated school
 
01:20:57.840 --> 01:20:58.950 align:start position:0%
one able to use these dedicated school
buildings

01:20:58.950 --> 01:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
buildings
 
01:21:02.629 --> 01:21:02.639 align:start position:0%
and another not able to so
 
01:21:05.990 --> 01:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
i would like or i would hope
 
01:21:09.030 --> 01:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
we would be able to recognize that
 
01:21:11.590 --> 01:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
having students in these schools that
 
01:21:14.149 --> 01:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
were built for that purpose
 
01:21:17.750 --> 01:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:21.030 --> 01:21:21.040 align:start position:0%
decision making process that we should
 
01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:21.510 align:start position:0%
decision making process that we should
be

01:21:21.510 --> 01:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:21:25.590 --> 01:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
heading towards and that's all i would
 
01:21:29.350 --> 01:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
like to put on
 
01:21:32.070 --> 01:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
i'd like to go ahead thank you thank you
 
01:21:33.350 --> 01:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
uh representative phil i just want to
 
01:21:33.990 --> 01:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
also just
 
01:21:36.709 --> 01:21:36.719 align:start position:0%
reconfirm something that you said that
 
01:21:36.719 --> 01:21:37.110 align:start position:0%
reconfirm something that you said that
if

01:21:37.110 --> 01:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:21:40.629 --> 01:21:40.639 align:start position:0%
say a town has a very
 
01:21:42.629 --> 01:21:42.639 align:start position:0%
what what would be a very lucrative
 
01:21:44.149 --> 01:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
property if they were to sell it on the
 
01:21:45.669 --> 01:21:45.679 align:start position:0%
open market for
 
01:21:48.629 --> 01:21:48.639 align:start position:0%
say um new housing or something of that
 
01:21:48.639 --> 01:21:49.189 align:start position:0%
say um new housing or something of that
nature

01:21:49.189 --> 01:21:49.199 align:start position:0%
nature
 
01:21:51.990 --> 01:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
nothing required in this legislation
 
01:21:53.910 --> 01:21:53.920 align:start position:0%
requires that they sell it to a school
 
01:21:56.950 --> 01:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
instead correct
 
01:21:59.030 --> 01:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
so just to follow up on that a little
 
01:22:01.189 --> 01:22:01.199 align:start position:0%
bit where senator hennessey is coming
 
01:22:01.199 --> 01:22:02.629 align:start position:0%
bit where senator hennessey is coming
from

01:22:02.629 --> 01:22:02.639 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:22:05.030 --> 01:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
if i were to close down woodsville
 
01:22:06.870 --> 01:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
elementary school which is right across
 
01:22:08.950 --> 01:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
from walmart
 
01:22:10.870 --> 01:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
and move the kids into middle school
 
01:22:12.550 --> 01:22:12.560 align:start position:0%
down in north haverhill
 
01:22:15.590 --> 01:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
the woodsville elementary school
 
01:22:17.350 --> 01:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
could be put on the market seeing the
 
01:22:19.270 --> 01:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
value of that property obviously
 
01:22:22.390 --> 01:22:22.400 align:start position:0%
rip down that school your folks like to
 
01:22:24.629 --> 01:22:24.639 align:start position:0%
move by the walmarts that's where your
 
01:22:26.310 --> 01:22:26.320 align:start position:0%
retailers are going to go
 
01:22:28.950 --> 01:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
so that's this bill has nothing to do
 
01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:31.030 align:start position:0%
so that's this bill has nothing to do
with

01:22:31.030 --> 01:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:22:33.030 --> 01:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
that situation it has something to do
 
01:22:34.870 --> 01:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
with it because there's obviously an
 
01:22:37.750 --> 01:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
obligation in the purchase and sale
 
01:22:37.760 --> 01:22:38.390 align:start position:0%
obligation in the purchase and sale
agreement

01:22:38.390 --> 01:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
01:22:43.030 --> 01:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
that that woodsville or the school board
 
01:22:45.430 --> 01:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
when they list it they would have the
 
01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:46.629 align:start position:0%
when they list it they would have the
requirement

01:22:46.629 --> 01:22:46.639 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
01:22:49.830 --> 01:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
to offer it to
 
01:22:53.350 --> 01:22:53.360 align:start position:0%
charter schools at the market price
 
01:22:56.790 --> 01:22:56.800 align:start position:0%
so if you're cbs or
 
01:22:59.590 --> 01:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
just to use it if if they wanted to be
 
01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
located where that building was
 
01:23:05.590 --> 01:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
and and the school board had
 
01:23:10.550 --> 01:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:12.629 --> 01:23:12.639 align:start position:0%
the school board would be required to
 
01:23:14.470 --> 01:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
have in the document
 
01:23:17.270 --> 01:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
in the purchase and sale agreement okay
 
01:23:18.830 --> 01:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
but we need to
 
01:23:22.790 --> 01:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
first alert or let the doe know
 
01:23:25.030 --> 01:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
who will then turn around and let the
 
01:23:26.470 --> 01:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
charter schools know
 
01:23:29.590 --> 01:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
that this property is available
 
01:23:31.830 --> 01:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
and and then they would look at it and
 
01:23:35.110 --> 01:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
say well in my belief
 
01:23:36.550 --> 01:23:36.560 align:start position:0%
they would look at and say there's no
 
01:23:38.310 --> 01:23:38.320 align:start position:0%
way we can compete with
 
01:23:41.669 --> 01:23:41.679 align:start position:0%
the cbs market price
 
01:23:44.629 --> 01:23:44.639 align:start position:0%
and therefore it would the deal would
 
01:23:46.709 --> 01:23:46.719 align:start position:0%
still continue on they probably
 
01:23:48.310 --> 01:23:48.320 align:start position:0%
in that situation they wouldn't even
 
01:23:50.870 --> 01:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
contact them and inquire
 
01:23:52.950 --> 01:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
it would be my feeling they would just
 
01:23:54.470 --> 01:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
say well
 
01:23:56.870 --> 01:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
if it's going to cvs it's obviously out
 
01:23:57.990 --> 01:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
of our price
 
01:24:00.470 --> 01:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
range so i don't think anything
 
01:24:02.229 --> 01:24:02.239 align:start position:0%
different changes in that regard
 
01:24:05.350 --> 01:24:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:08.950 --> 01:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
i think we're in agreement with that
 
01:24:10.470 --> 01:24:10.480 align:start position:0%
it seems to me you're talking about
 
01:24:11.990 --> 01:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
putting it on the market
 
01:24:14.070 --> 01:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
so if a school is put on the market
 
01:24:16.310 --> 01:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you at the same time notify the
 
01:24:18.709 --> 01:24:18.719 align:start position:0%
doe and do you read could set out
 
01:24:22.390 --> 01:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
yes so it is not necessarily that
 
01:24:24.629 --> 01:24:24.639 align:start position:0%
cvs hears about it first that comes in
 
01:24:25.510 --> 01:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
and gives
 
01:24:28.229 --> 01:24:28.239 align:start position:0%
an offer and then later on by the way
 
01:24:28.950 --> 01:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
there are
 
01:24:30.550 --> 01:24:30.560 align:start position:0%
you have to offer it to the schools it
 
01:24:31.990 --> 01:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
seems to me they should be done
 
01:24:35.590 --> 01:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
at the same time um i think what
 
01:24:36.709 --> 01:24:36.719 align:start position:0%
typically happens
 
01:24:39.430 --> 01:24:39.440 align:start position:0%
well and maybe in your it's your
 
01:24:41.110 --> 01:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
scenario so maybe you can
 
01:24:43.990 --> 01:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
explain what what you're dealing with
 
01:24:45.669 --> 01:24:45.679 align:start position:0%
but it would seem to me
 
01:24:48.229 --> 01:24:48.239 align:start position:0%
that um either through word of mouth or
 
01:24:50.390 --> 01:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
a local broker or somebody
 
01:24:53.590 --> 01:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
that is scouting um
 
01:24:57.350 --> 01:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
properties for a new cvs
 
01:24:59.189 --> 01:24:59.199 align:start position:0%
not to pick on cvs but it could be
 
01:25:01.350 --> 01:25:01.360 align:start position:0%
anything um if you're putting in a
 
01:25:03.990 --> 01:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
walmart across the street
 
01:25:05.750 --> 01:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
i believe that there are brokers that
 
01:25:07.990 --> 01:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
look for properties wherever a walmart
 
01:25:08.709 --> 01:25:08.719 align:start position:0%
is going
 
01:25:12.550 --> 01:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
so whatever drives the bus first i
 
01:25:14.629 --> 01:25:14.639 align:start position:0%
i don't know i mean it would seem to me
 
01:25:15.590 --> 01:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
01:25:17.430 --> 01:25:17.440 align:start position:0%
there is someone looking for where
 
01:25:19.110 --> 01:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
walmart's going and then they're looking
 
01:25:20.870 --> 01:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
for the properties nearby
 
01:25:22.709 --> 01:25:22.719 align:start position:0%
so they would probably approach the
 
01:25:24.390 --> 01:25:24.400 align:start position:0%
school board and say you know you have
 
01:25:25.590 --> 01:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
this school here
 
01:25:28.149 --> 01:25:28.159 align:start position:0%
we're happy to buy it for x number of
 
01:25:28.159 --> 01:25:28.709 align:start position:0%
we're happy to buy it for x number of
dollars

01:25:28.709 --> 01:25:28.719 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:25:31.590 --> 01:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
and the school board would say that's
 
01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:32.149 align:start position:0%
and the school board would say that's
great

01:25:32.149 --> 01:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
great
 
01:25:34.070 --> 01:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
but in new hampshire we have this
 
01:25:36.229 --> 01:25:36.239 align:start position:0%
provision that requires us to
 
01:25:38.790 --> 01:25:38.800 align:start position:0%
if we're going to sell it we have to
 
01:25:42.070 --> 01:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
first offer it to charter schools
 
01:25:45.430 --> 01:25:45.440 align:start position:0%
that's how i think representative
 
01:25:48.870 --> 01:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
thank you um but also based on timing
 
01:25:51.910 --> 01:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
it's uh possible in that scenario
 
01:25:54.070 --> 01:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
that the property would have been listed
 
01:25:56.149 --> 01:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
with the department of education because
 
01:25:57.030 --> 01:25:57.040 align:start position:0%
there was
 
01:25:59.669 --> 01:25:59.679 align:start position:0%
uh unused space so it could well be that
 
01:26:02.310 --> 01:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
they were already on the list
 
01:26:05.510 --> 01:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
at the department of education
 
01:26:09.110 --> 01:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
and that's why the unused property list
 
01:26:14.149 --> 01:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:22.229 --> 01:26:22.239 align:start position:0%
chartered school upon notice of sale
 
01:26:25.510 --> 01:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
have to indicate that they had wished to
 
01:26:33.030 --> 01:26:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:39.430 --> 01:26:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:42.149 --> 01:26:42.159 align:start position:0%
i know it came up in the senate hearings
 
01:26:48.830 --> 01:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:48.840 --> 01:27:02.830 align:start position:0%
 
but

01:27:02.830 --> 01:27:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:16.070 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:27:16.070 --> 01:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:19.830 --> 01:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
the last sentence says the writer person
 
01:27:22.550 --> 01:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
60 days after the notification to the
 
01:27:25.430 --> 01:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
charter school administrator
 
01:27:28.709 --> 01:27:28.719 align:start position:0%
and then six months after that to
 
01:27:32.229 --> 01:27:32.239 align:start position:0%
conclude to conclude the work
 
01:27:35.350 --> 01:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
by the uh lease or right
 
01:27:41.189 --> 01:27:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:45.430 --> 01:27:45.440 align:start position:0%
so uh let me give you
 
01:27:47.669 --> 01:27:47.679 align:start position:0%
a couple of reasons that i think the
 
01:27:49.030 --> 01:27:49.040 align:start position:0%
senate version
 
01:27:52.709 --> 01:27:52.719 align:start position:0%
is a better version because of the
 
01:27:52.719 --> 01:27:54.229 align:start position:0%
is a better version because of the
definition

01:27:54.229 --> 01:27:54.239 align:start position:0%
definition
 
01:27:58.950 --> 01:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:01.669 --> 01:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
first off it doesn't require unused
 
01:28:03.350 --> 01:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't require
 
01:28:06.310 --> 01:28:06.320 align:start position:0%
any additional measurement unused is
 
01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:07.110 align:start position:0%
any additional measurement unused is
unused

01:28:07.110 --> 01:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
unused
 
01:28:10.550 --> 01:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
and right so
 
01:28:14.550 --> 01:28:14.560 align:start position:0%
i i think that's just so clear um
 
01:28:17.830 --> 01:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
and and if i come from a
 
01:28:21.110 --> 01:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
city that has six
 
01:28:24.629 --> 01:28:24.639 align:start position:0%
unused school buildings which i do
 
01:28:27.189 --> 01:28:27.199 align:start position:0%
and each one of those six has either a
 
01:28:28.390 --> 01:28:28.400 align:start position:0%
private school
 
01:28:30.550 --> 01:28:30.560 align:start position:0%
or a public school or it's been turned
 
01:28:33.430 --> 01:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
into an apartment building
 
01:28:35.990 --> 01:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
so you know back on the tax rolls and
 
01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:36.470 align:start position:0%
so you know back on the tax rolls and
amen

01:28:36.470 --> 01:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
amen
 
01:28:40.070 --> 01:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
the city is proud of that uh
 
01:28:41.669 --> 01:28:41.679 align:start position:0%
because the redevelopment that took
 
01:28:44.070 --> 01:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
place um
 
01:28:47.110 --> 01:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
so local control
 
01:28:50.629 --> 01:28:50.639 align:start position:0%
and the ability to just do this without
 
01:28:52.709 --> 01:28:52.719 align:start position:0%
state statute without a lispy needing to
 
01:28:53.669 --> 01:28:53.679 align:start position:0%
be maintained
 
01:28:56.070 --> 01:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
without it needing to be publicized you
 
01:28:58.229 --> 01:28:58.239 align:start position:0%
know all over the state
 
01:29:02.550 --> 01:29:02.560 align:start position:0%
it's just happened and uh yeah
 
01:29:05.910 --> 01:29:05.920 align:start position:0%
so there's a part of this local control
 
01:29:07.510 --> 01:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
what do we need to do this for
 
01:29:09.110 --> 01:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
and i think for three years it's pretty
 
01:29:10.629 --> 01:29:10.639 align:start position:0%
much inhibited
 
01:29:12.470 --> 01:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
this legislation which we've seen in
 
01:29:14.070 --> 01:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
some form or another over the last three
 
01:29:15.510 --> 01:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
years come forward
 
01:29:19.030 --> 01:29:19.040 align:start position:0%
and not be adopted so
 
01:29:22.790 --> 01:29:22.800 align:start position:0%
uh i i believe
 
01:29:26.310 --> 01:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
the senate adopted the version did
 
01:29:29.990 --> 01:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh so that we
 
01:29:31.910 --> 01:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
one make it simple for the school
 
01:29:33.430 --> 01:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
districts to
 
01:29:36.790 --> 01:29:36.800 align:start position:0%
determine unused
 
01:29:40.550 --> 01:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
uh second uh that
 
01:29:43.910 --> 01:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
we have an amendment uh
 
01:29:47.270 --> 01:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:50.709 --> 01:29:50.719 align:start position:0%
you know if if there's the democrats
 
01:29:52.070 --> 01:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
could sign up
 
01:29:55.350 --> 01:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
and why is a bipartisan
 
01:29:58.390 --> 01:29:58.400 align:start position:0%
agreement on this of course for me
 
01:30:01.669 --> 01:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
is because i think you want this to
 
01:30:01.679 --> 01:30:02.950 align:start position:0%
is because i think you want this to
stick

01:30:02.950 --> 01:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
stick
 
01:30:06.390 --> 01:30:06.400 align:start position:0%
for a long time and someday
 
01:30:09.189 --> 01:30:09.199 align:start position:0%
i don't know you named the year i can't
 
01:30:11.030 --> 01:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
get it
 
01:30:14.629 --> 01:30:14.639 align:start position:0%
someday you know a different legislature
 
01:30:16.310 --> 01:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
is going to look at this and say did any
 
01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:17.430 align:start position:0%
is going to look at this and say did any
democrats

01:30:17.430 --> 01:30:17.440 align:start position:0%
democrats
 
01:30:20.310 --> 01:30:20.320 align:start position:0%
sign on to this did any vote for this
 
01:30:22.229 --> 01:30:22.239 align:start position:0%
and if they find evidence that it's a
 
01:30:25.270 --> 01:30:25.280 align:start position:0%
one-party slamming in uh
 
01:30:28.550 --> 01:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
kind of bill uh
 
01:30:31.590 --> 01:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
it's gonna it could be undone
 
01:30:35.030 --> 01:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
and personally having seen this come
 
01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:35.510 align:start position:0%
and personally having seen this come
around

01:30:35.510 --> 01:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:30:39.590 --> 01:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
three times already i hope that doesn't
 
01:30:42.629 --> 01:30:42.639 align:start position:0%
but i you know i
 
01:30:45.110 --> 01:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
if we're gonna put something on to
 
01:30:46.310 --> 01:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
school districts
 
01:30:49.669 --> 01:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
that they feel they don't need that
 
01:30:52.470 --> 01:30:52.480 align:start position:0%
requires additional measurements and
 
01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:53.669 align:start position:0%
requires additional measurements and
evaluations

01:30:53.669 --> 01:30:53.679 align:start position:0%
evaluations
 
01:30:57.430 --> 01:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
and uh you know it could very easily
 
01:31:01.189 --> 01:31:01.199 align:start position:0%
be undone uh in the future and
 
01:31:06.709 --> 01:31:06.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:10.149 --> 01:31:10.159 align:start position:0%
passed for my opinion okay senator khan
 
01:31:21.910 --> 01:31:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:25.030 --> 01:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
i'll wait and do that later in life
 
01:31:28.470 --> 01:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
but this is just a sample language to
 
01:31:30.390 --> 01:31:30.400 align:start position:0%
bring into this discussion
 
01:31:33.669 --> 01:31:33.679 align:start position:0%
the the house had incorporated
 
01:31:37.110 --> 01:31:37.120 align:start position:0%
uh a line that uh said with and also
 
01:31:37.910 --> 01:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
with less than
 
01:31:40.310 --> 01:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
10 percent of the facility being used
 
01:31:41.990 --> 01:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
that that part
 
01:31:45.189 --> 01:31:45.199 align:start position:0%
um so this this speaks to
 
01:31:48.070 --> 01:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
um yeah a lot of these buildings are
 
01:31:48.080 --> 01:31:49.510 align:start position:0%
um yeah a lot of these buildings are
standing

01:31:49.510 --> 01:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
standing
 
01:31:52.310 --> 01:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
unused but they're either used for
 
01:31:54.070 --> 01:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
storage or they're used for
 
01:31:56.390 --> 01:31:56.400 align:start position:0%
some purpose you know we could go
 
01:31:58.390 --> 01:31:58.400 align:start position:0%
through the litany of purposes
 
01:32:01.510 --> 01:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
which is less than 10 square 10 percent
 
01:32:03.910 --> 01:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
of the square footage of the facility
 
01:32:06.550 --> 01:32:06.560 align:start position:0%
so that's i would consider that building
 
01:32:06.560 --> 01:32:08.310 align:start position:0%
so that's i would consider that building
underutilized

01:32:08.310 --> 01:32:08.320 align:start position:0%
underutilized
 
01:32:11.270 --> 01:32:11.280 align:start position:0%
um is there room for this type of
 
01:32:13.990 --> 01:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
language that you're seeing right here
 
01:32:17.669 --> 01:32:17.679 align:start position:0%
to blend in with uh language which
 
01:32:22.070 --> 01:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
the senate has put forward
 
01:32:23.669 --> 01:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
i think from the sticking point has been
 
01:32:25.270 --> 01:32:25.280 align:start position:0%
that the ten percent
 
01:32:27.750 --> 01:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
ten percent of what how do you measure
 
01:32:29.510 --> 01:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
the which buildings do you take a look
 
01:32:29.520 --> 01:32:30.310 align:start position:0%
the which buildings do you take a look
at

01:32:30.310 --> 01:32:30.320 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:32:32.550 --> 01:32:32.560 align:start position:0%
and i think when you say something like
 
01:32:34.950 --> 01:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
that you have to tell
 
01:32:38.070 --> 01:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
exactly what you're mentioning the
 
01:32:42.149 --> 01:32:42.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:43.350 --> 01:32:43.360 align:start position:0%
sometimes they have more than one
 
01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:45.189 align:start position:0%
sometimes they have more than one
building

01:32:45.189 --> 01:32:45.199 align:start position:0%
building
 
01:32:46.790 --> 01:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
and people have asked if they have a
 
01:32:48.550 --> 01:32:48.560 align:start position:0%
separate gym or something like that
 
01:32:52.950 --> 01:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:55.830 --> 01:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
oh i see what you're saying so um so
 
01:32:55.840 --> 01:32:56.390 align:start position:0%
oh i see what you're saying so um so
like

01:32:56.390 --> 01:32:56.400 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:32:58.310 --> 01:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
if you look at my the elementary school
 
01:32:59.910 --> 01:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
in my district they have
 
01:33:02.790 --> 01:33:02.800 align:start position:0%
like a kind of attached detached
 
01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:03.830 align:start position:0%
like a kind of attached detached
structure

01:33:03.830 --> 01:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
structure
 
01:33:05.510 --> 01:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
and like the high school i grew up going
 
01:33:07.270 --> 01:33:07.280 align:start position:0%
to had all these different
 
01:33:09.830 --> 01:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
pods in different buildings that you
 
01:33:10.950 --> 01:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
would have
 
01:33:14.229 --> 01:33:14.239 align:start position:0%
portable sunny south florida yeah
 
01:33:16.149 --> 01:33:16.159 align:start position:0%
portable classrooms and then even just
 
01:33:18.390 --> 01:33:18.400 align:start position:0%
different buildings on the campus so
 
01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:20.390 align:start position:0%
different buildings on the campus so
maybe

01:33:20.390 --> 01:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
01:33:22.950 --> 01:33:22.960 align:start position:0%
maybe it can be defined whether it's
 
01:33:25.510 --> 01:33:25.520 align:start position:0%
campus or visitor
 
01:33:28.950 --> 01:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:33.189 --> 01:33:33.199 align:start position:0%
yeah go ahead so um in light of the
 
01:33:36.310 --> 01:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
unused definition that you had
 
01:33:39.270 --> 01:33:39.280 align:start position:0%
in the senate side how would that fit in
 
01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:39.669 align:start position:0%
in the senate side how would that fit in
with

01:33:39.669 --> 01:33:39.679 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:33:43.590 --> 01:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
this scenario with um multiple buildings
 
01:33:46.950 --> 01:33:46.960 align:start position:0%
right does that mean if if one of the
 
01:33:46.960 --> 01:33:48.830 align:start position:0%
right does that mean if if one of the
buildings

01:33:48.830 --> 01:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
buildings
 
01:33:48.840 --> 01:33:53.110 align:start position:0%
buildings
houses

01:33:53.110 --> 01:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:56.149 --> 01:33:56.159 align:start position:0%
does that mean that the entire
 
01:34:00.790 --> 01:34:00.800 align:start position:0%
complex is then being used and therefore
 
01:34:04.470 --> 01:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
which which ruins the intent
 
01:34:08.470 --> 01:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
of the building of the bill um
 
01:34:11.430 --> 01:34:11.440 align:start position:0%
so and that this is the dancing on the
 
01:34:12.310 --> 01:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
head of the pin
 
01:34:15.669 --> 01:34:15.679 align:start position:0%
problem that we're having here um
 
01:34:18.950 --> 01:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
the intent is to make sure from my point
 
01:34:19.350 --> 01:34:19.360 align:start position:0%
of view
 
01:34:22.629 --> 01:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
to make sure valuable space is being
 
01:34:23.350 --> 01:34:23.360 align:start position:0%
used for
 
01:34:26.390 --> 01:34:26.400 align:start position:0%
valuable children um that's
 
01:34:28.790 --> 01:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
that's all i want to get to i want to
 
01:34:29.750 --> 01:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
make sure
 
01:34:33.110 --> 01:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
that we don't have um
 
01:34:36.550 --> 01:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
that expensive and
 
01:34:41.270 --> 01:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
and designed for children property
 
01:34:45.510 --> 01:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
underutilized yeah i think
 
01:34:49.830 --> 01:34:49.840 align:start position:0%
the underutilized is left out in senate
 
01:34:53.030 --> 01:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
side of the equation
 
01:34:55.350 --> 01:34:55.360 align:start position:0%
my reading and senate side is that the
 
01:34:56.950 --> 01:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
entire facility
 
01:35:01.830 --> 01:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
has to be unused well it says
 
01:35:05.430 --> 01:35:05.440 align:start position:0%
unused facility means a school
 
01:35:09.270 --> 01:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
building right right so in the scenario
 
01:35:14.310 --> 01:35:14.320 align:start position:0%
that senator hennessey described
 
01:35:17.510 --> 01:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
a school building among several school
 
01:35:18.790 --> 01:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
buildings on the same
 
01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:32.970 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:32.970 --> 01:35:36.790 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

01:35:36.790 --> 01:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:35:38.550 --> 01:35:38.560 align:start position:0%
so you look at school building aid we
 
01:35:40.229 --> 01:35:40.239 align:start position:0%
talk about a school
 
01:35:46.470 --> 01:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:49.109 --> 01:35:49.119 align:start position:0%
you know i i i taking senator
 
01:35:49.119 --> 01:35:50.470 align:start position:0%
you know i i i taking senator
hennessey's

01:35:50.470 --> 01:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
hennessey's
 
01:35:52.950 --> 01:35:52.960 align:start position:0%
example maybe using portable classrooms
 
01:35:53.830 --> 01:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
with a you know
 
01:35:57.430 --> 01:35:57.440 align:start position:0%
in that whole campus being a facility
 
01:35:59.430 --> 01:35:59.440 align:start position:0%
i think there's some question that uh
 
01:36:00.870 --> 01:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
stu and i i think you
 
01:36:03.109 --> 01:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
must agree that one of those portable
 
01:36:05.430 --> 01:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
classrooms could be used for storage of
 
01:36:08.310 --> 01:36:08.320 align:start position:0%
furniture the rest of them are all empty
 
01:36:10.229 --> 01:36:10.239 align:start position:0%
because that portable classroom
 
01:36:14.790 --> 01:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
is now utilized is the whole facility
 
01:36:17.830 --> 01:36:17.840 align:start position:0%
um underutilized or is it
 
01:36:21.189 --> 01:36:21.199 align:start position:0%
um dancing on that opinion
 
01:36:25.910 --> 01:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
yeah well um
 
01:36:28.950 --> 01:36:28.960 align:start position:0%
if you again look at
 
01:36:32.390 --> 01:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
uh senate definition it's an unused
 
01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:33.590 align:start position:0%
uh senate definition it's an unused
facility

01:36:33.590 --> 01:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
facility
 
01:36:35.590 --> 01:36:35.600 align:start position:0%
if it's not used for academic purposes
 
01:36:36.790 --> 01:36:36.800 align:start position:0%
extracurricular activities
 
01:36:38.229 --> 01:36:38.239 align:start position:0%
administrative school functions or
 
01:36:38.239 --> 01:36:42.229 align:start position:0%
administrative school functions or
sports

01:36:42.229 --> 01:36:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:43.830 --> 01:36:43.840 align:start position:0%
i think it may be nice to use the
 
01:36:45.430 --> 01:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
building to store furniture but that's
 
01:36:47.189 --> 01:36:47.199 align:start position:0%
not the purpose of the building
 
01:36:49.189 --> 01:36:49.199 align:start position:0%
and if they're just temporarily putting
 
01:36:50.870 --> 01:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
something in it i think that
 
01:36:54.550 --> 01:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
just just to keep it used
 
01:36:58.149 --> 01:36:58.159 align:start position:0%
i think that sort of so then let me
 
01:36:59.990 --> 01:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
ratchet it up another step then so we
 
01:37:01.750 --> 01:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
take that portable classroom and using
 
01:37:02.950 --> 01:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
that for the director of special
 
01:37:06.070 --> 01:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
education services
 
01:37:10.390 --> 01:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
now it's being used for an academic end
 
01:37:15.270 --> 01:37:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:20.149 --> 01:37:20.159 align:start position:0%
so how do we handle that situation it's
 
01:37:21.350 --> 01:37:21.360 align:start position:0%
being used
 
01:37:23.669 --> 01:37:23.679 align:start position:0%
it's being used for a portion of what is
 
01:37:25.990 --> 01:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
defined in the senate version
 
01:37:28.390 --> 01:37:28.400 align:start position:0%
and and why not i mean i can think of a
 
01:37:28.400 --> 01:37:29.270 align:start position:0%
and and why not i mean i can think of a
building

01:37:29.270 --> 01:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
building
 
01:37:32.390 --> 01:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
that is vacant uh vacant elementary
 
01:37:34.070 --> 01:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
school as we consolidated from
 
01:37:37.910 --> 01:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
five to four and uh it has adult
 
01:37:37.920 --> 01:37:38.709 align:start position:0%
five to four and uh it has adult
education

01:37:38.709 --> 01:37:38.719 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:37:42.990 --> 01:37:43.000 align:start position:0%
which is not k through 12. it has
 
01:37:45.990 --> 01:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
a preschool which is run
 
01:37:49.270 --> 01:37:49.280 align:start position:0%
for title one purposes uh
 
01:37:52.790 --> 01:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
and uh head start uh
 
01:37:55.030 --> 01:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's a very active building it's a
 
01:37:56.790 --> 01:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
terrific use
 
01:38:00.070 --> 01:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
uh it may not fit in the house
 
01:38:03.830 --> 01:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
version uh but it's a terrific use by
 
01:38:07.350 --> 01:38:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:10.070 --> 01:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
i think i think that's clear in the
 
01:38:11.669 --> 01:38:11.679 align:start position:0%
senate version
 
01:38:15.189 --> 01:38:15.199 align:start position:0%
that those are academic uses
 
01:38:17.189 --> 01:38:17.199 align:start position:0%
including the administrative use for the
 
01:38:19.030 --> 01:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
special education director or adult
 
01:38:21.510 --> 01:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
education director in this case
 
01:38:24.470 --> 01:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
uh and you know the building was
 
01:38:25.590 --> 01:38:25.600 align:start position:0%
essentially 100
 
01:38:27.430 --> 01:38:27.440 align:start position:0%
utilized so it's not even i mean we
 
01:38:28.790 --> 01:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be measuring you know
 
01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:37.750 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be measuring you know
ten

01:38:37.750 --> 01:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:40.870 --> 01:38:40.880 align:start position:0%
are we all in agreement um with
 
01:38:45.030 --> 01:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
the use used for academic purposes
 
01:38:46.629 --> 01:38:46.639 align:start position:0%
extracurricular activities
 
01:38:48.550 --> 01:38:48.560 align:start position:0%
administrative school functions
 
01:38:52.470 --> 01:38:52.480 align:start position:0%
or sports i think that's common with
 
01:38:55.590 --> 01:38:55.600 align:start position:0%
everything that both on the house and
 
01:38:58.870 --> 01:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
senate side i get the feeling from
 
01:39:01.669 --> 01:39:01.679 align:start position:0%
talking with representatives that we are
 
01:39:02.950 --> 01:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
supportive of that
 
01:39:05.109 --> 01:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
part of the definition so the the
 
01:39:06.390 --> 01:39:06.400 align:start position:0%
senate's definition
 
01:39:09.430 --> 01:39:09.440 align:start position:0%
yeah i think the hang-up is on the ten
 
01:39:09.440 --> 01:39:14.070 align:start position:0%
yeah i think the hang-up is on the ten
percent

01:39:14.070 --> 01:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:16.229 --> 01:39:16.239 align:start position:0%
for example one of the buildings i did
 
01:39:18.070 --> 01:39:18.080 align:start position:0%
had had an older building
 
01:39:20.229 --> 01:39:20.239 align:start position:0%
another older building and we had two
 
01:39:23.270 --> 01:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
three portable classrooms
 
01:39:25.030 --> 01:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
if one of those portable classrooms was
 
01:39:27.350 --> 01:39:27.360 align:start position:0%
used for some service
 
01:39:29.270 --> 01:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be wonderful to be able to
 
01:39:30.950 --> 01:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
have a charter school come in and take
 
01:39:32.550 --> 01:39:32.560 align:start position:0%
advantage of the gym
 
01:39:35.669 --> 01:39:35.679 align:start position:0%
of the other services in the other
 
01:39:35.679 --> 01:39:36.870 align:start position:0%
of the other services in the other
portions

01:39:36.870 --> 01:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
portions
 
01:39:39.830 --> 01:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
of the facilities now the facility may
 
01:39:41.270 --> 01:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
be a whole or maybe
 
01:39:44.310 --> 01:39:44.320 align:start position:0%
you know broken up um
 
01:39:47.910 --> 01:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
i i think in my terms of looking at
 
01:39:51.270 --> 01:39:51.280 align:start position:0%
how can this really benefit
 
01:39:55.030 --> 01:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
alternative forms of education such as a
 
01:39:56.390 --> 01:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
charter school
 
01:39:59.030 --> 01:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
and offer those kids that opportunity i
 
01:40:00.790 --> 01:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
think there's a wonderful opportunity if
 
01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:01.350 align:start position:0%
think there's a wonderful opportunity if
we

01:40:01.350 --> 01:40:01.360 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:40:04.709 --> 01:40:04.719 align:start position:0%
we don't lock it down so that
 
01:40:07.350 --> 01:40:07.360 align:start position:0%
the whole facility is not able to be
 
01:40:08.310 --> 01:40:08.320 align:start position:0%
used because
 
01:40:10.790 --> 01:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
or it's being under utilized but it's
 
01:40:12.790 --> 01:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
being used
 
01:40:16.550 --> 01:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
so i i think there is room for
 
01:40:19.430 --> 01:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
this portion which is tentatively put
 
01:40:20.550 --> 01:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
here or under
 
01:40:21.990 --> 01:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
underutilized with less than ten percent
 
01:40:24.310 --> 01:40:24.320 align:start position:0%
of square foot for the building
 
01:40:27.030 --> 01:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
um used for those purposes that we've
 
01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:27.990 align:start position:0%
um used for those purposes that we've
discussed

01:40:27.990 --> 01:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
discussed
 
01:40:29.430 --> 01:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
i think it's coming down to that first
 
01:40:32.070 --> 01:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
part of this sentence
 
01:40:45.669 --> 01:40:45.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:48.390 --> 01:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
facility meaning for example londonderry
 
01:40:49.270 --> 01:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
high school
 
01:40:52.950 --> 01:40:52.960 align:start position:0%
facility it got a separate gym off by
 
01:40:52.960 --> 01:40:54.629 align:start position:0%
facility it got a separate gym off by
itself

01:40:54.629 --> 01:40:54.639 align:start position:0%
itself
 
01:40:58.149 --> 01:40:58.159 align:start position:0%
and so is that a separate facility or is
 
01:40:59.750 --> 01:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
that part of the facility and i
 
01:41:02.390 --> 01:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
think that's somewhere the hangar face i
 
01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:02.790 align:start position:0%
think that's somewhere the hangar face i
mean

01:41:02.790 --> 01:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
mean
 
01:41:05.750 --> 01:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
here we say in this subdivision unused
 
01:41:09.510 --> 01:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
facility means a school building
 
01:41:12.629 --> 01:41:12.639 align:start position:0%
but it could be you know that a whole
 
01:41:14.390 --> 01:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
facility or just one building
 
01:41:17.590 --> 01:41:17.600 align:start position:0%
in a facility uh it's so
 
01:41:20.950 --> 01:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
are you are you envisioning
 
01:41:22.070 --> 01:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
it's very hard dealing with
 
01:41:24.470 --> 01:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
hypotheticals i know so
 
01:41:28.470 --> 01:41:28.480 align:start position:0%
so are you envisioning the idea that uh
 
01:41:31.189 --> 01:41:31.199 align:start position:0%
through demographics with with the
 
01:41:31.199 --> 01:41:33.189 align:start position:0%
through demographics with with the
smaller

01:41:33.189 --> 01:41:33.199 align:start position:0%
smaller
 
01:41:37.109 --> 01:41:37.119 align:start position:0%
size that litchfield would be
 
01:41:39.910 --> 01:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
um thinking we're going to move people
 
01:41:42.149 --> 01:41:42.159 align:start position:0%
out of that gymnasium and have that
 
01:41:43.910 --> 01:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
i mean it's such a specialized building
 
01:41:45.430 --> 01:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
but i think the
 
01:41:47.590 --> 01:41:47.600 align:start position:0%
companies yes i think yeah i'm just
 
01:41:49.910 --> 01:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
looking at the word facility and it's in
 
01:41:49.920 --> 01:41:50.870 align:start position:0%
looking at the word facility and it's in
building

01:41:50.870 --> 01:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
building
 
01:41:52.629 --> 01:41:52.639 align:start position:0%
needs a school building owned by a
 
01:41:54.550 --> 01:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
school district and
 
01:41:55.830 --> 01:41:55.840 align:start position:0%
i think that's where it needs to be
 
01:41:57.830 --> 01:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
brought i think
 
01:41:59.910 --> 01:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
charter schools wouldn't be interested
 
01:42:02.070 --> 01:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
in the gymnasium
 
01:42:03.669 --> 01:42:03.679 align:start position:0%
i think charter schools would be
 
01:42:06.310 --> 01:42:06.320 align:start position:0%
interested in
 
01:42:08.950 --> 01:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
classrooms because what they're having
 
01:42:09.990 --> 01:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
to do now
 
01:42:13.109 --> 01:42:13.119 align:start position:0%
is generally lease a commercial space
 
01:42:16.709 --> 01:42:16.719 align:start position:0%
that has no classrooms and
 
01:42:19.350 --> 01:42:19.360 align:start position:0%
no kitchen facilities no anything like
 
01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:20.709 align:start position:0%
no kitchen facilities no anything like
that

01:42:20.709 --> 01:42:20.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:42:24.790 --> 01:42:24.800 align:start position:0%
so what i envision a charter school
 
01:42:27.109 --> 01:42:27.119 align:start position:0%
when they come online start looking for
 
01:42:28.709 --> 01:42:28.719 align:start position:0%
a place to go
 
01:42:31.510 --> 01:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
they're not looking for the gymnasium of
 
01:42:31.520 --> 01:42:31.910 align:start position:0%
they're not looking for the gymnasium of
or

01:42:31.910 --> 01:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:42:34.390 --> 01:42:34.400 align:start position:0%
or the temporary classrooms or the you
 
01:42:35.350 --> 01:42:35.360 align:start position:0%
know any of that
 
01:42:37.750 --> 01:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
they're looking for where's a place that
 
01:42:40.950 --> 01:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:44.470 --> 01:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
for a long period of time in a
 
01:42:48.149 --> 01:42:48.159 align:start position:0%
in a functional or a facility that is
 
01:42:49.910 --> 01:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
built for our function
 
01:42:53.270 --> 01:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
which is classrooms and so all of these
 
01:42:55.430 --> 01:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
extraneous you know well we have a shed
 
01:42:56.550 --> 01:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
over here for the
 
01:42:56.560 --> 01:42:59.590 align:start position:0%
over here for the
track

01:42:59.590 --> 01:42:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:02.870 --> 01:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
that that's um not to the point
 
01:43:06.390 --> 01:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
i think i think we need to focus on the
 
01:43:08.229 --> 01:43:08.239 align:start position:0%
idea that
 
01:43:10.470 --> 01:43:10.480 align:start position:0%
and that's why in the original original
 
01:43:12.070 --> 01:43:12.080 align:start position:0%
build um
 
01:43:15.590 --> 01:43:15.600 align:start position:0%
it spoke to direct student instruction
 
01:43:18.870 --> 01:43:18.880 align:start position:0%
that was that was what
 
01:43:20.870 --> 01:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
senator geider and i sat down with a
 
01:43:22.790 --> 01:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
piece of paper and said
 
01:43:25.510 --> 01:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
you know this what what do charters want
 
01:43:27.030 --> 01:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
what do they need
 
01:43:30.390 --> 01:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
and instead of having a
 
01:43:32.470 --> 01:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
commercial facility in the middle of a
 
01:43:34.229 --> 01:43:34.239 align:start position:0%
mall you know
 
01:43:38.709 --> 01:43:38.719 align:start position:0%
what what should we be targeting
 
01:43:40.950 --> 01:43:40.960 align:start position:0%
and that's why the direct student
 
01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:41.990 align:start position:0%
and that's why the direct student
instruction

01:43:41.990 --> 01:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
instruction
 
01:43:45.109 --> 01:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
phrase was in the original language
 
01:43:47.910 --> 01:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
but you know you you got to recognize
 
01:43:51.669 --> 01:43:51.679 align:start position:0%
that charters are charter public schools
 
01:43:53.830 --> 01:43:53.840 align:start position:0%
that are required to provide those types
 
01:43:55.189 --> 01:43:55.199 align:start position:0%
of standards
 
01:44:00.390 --> 01:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
music instruction physical education
 
01:44:01.510 --> 01:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
and the kids are going to be there all
 
01:44:02.870 --> 01:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
day so there's going to be some food
 
01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:05.350 align:start position:0%
day so there's going to be some food
services

01:44:05.350 --> 01:44:05.360 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:44:08.470 --> 01:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
media instruction computers um
 
01:44:10.149 --> 01:44:10.159 align:start position:0%
yes i agree they need to have
 
01:44:12.070 --> 01:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
instructional space but instructional
 
01:44:13.030 --> 01:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
space is not
 
01:44:16.790 --> 01:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:20.390 --> 01:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
um and this is why
 
01:44:22.470 --> 01:44:22.480 align:start position:0%
this is why we have the different
 
01:44:24.950 --> 01:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
versions coming through
 
01:44:27.910 --> 01:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
i mean we obviously have charter schools
 
01:44:27.920 --> 01:44:28.870 align:start position:0%
i mean we obviously have charter schools
now

01:44:28.870 --> 01:44:28.880 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:44:30.709 --> 01:44:30.719 align:start position:0%
we had one in the middle of them all i
 
01:44:31.910 --> 01:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
don't know what they did
 
01:44:35.910 --> 01:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
for um physical education facilities
 
01:44:38.550 --> 01:44:38.560 align:start position:0%
um i mean they don't have playgrounds
 
01:44:39.109 --> 01:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
they had
 
01:44:41.669 --> 01:44:41.679 align:start position:0%
in a commercial this setting the mall
 
01:44:43.910 --> 01:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
was owned by a school district
 
01:44:46.950 --> 01:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
um yeah all of those for all of those
 
01:44:48.229 --> 01:44:48.239 align:start position:0%
reasons these are the
 
01:44:50.550 --> 01:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
this these unused buildings are the
 
01:44:51.750 --> 01:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
logical place
 
01:44:54.870 --> 01:44:54.880 align:start position:0%
for a charter school to be um
 
01:44:56.790 --> 01:44:56.800 align:start position:0%
if they don't have kitchen facilities
 
01:44:58.550 --> 01:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
they then have to
 
01:45:01.189 --> 01:45:01.199 align:start position:0%
arrange for delivery of food or
 
01:45:02.070 --> 01:45:02.080 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
01:45:05.430 --> 01:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
and then that eliminates their
 
01:45:08.070 --> 01:45:08.080 align:start position:0%
their funding federal funding for that
 
01:45:08.080 --> 01:45:09.590 align:start position:0%
their funding federal funding for that
so

01:45:09.590 --> 01:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:45:12.709 --> 01:45:12.719 align:start position:0%
it if we can figure out a way
 
01:45:17.189 --> 01:45:17.199 align:start position:0%
to not try to have every possibility
 
01:45:21.510 --> 01:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
well what if i have a you know a jimmy
 
01:45:24.470 --> 01:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
let's focus on the goal here and the
 
01:45:26.390 --> 01:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
goal is to try to make sure
 
01:45:29.189 --> 01:45:29.199 align:start position:0%
this a kid that is now maybe in the
 
01:45:30.629 --> 01:45:30.639 align:start position:0%
middle of them all
 
01:45:34.149 --> 01:45:34.159 align:start position:0%
has a suitable facility for learning
 
01:45:37.430 --> 01:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
um that's my thing when i mentioned
 
01:45:39.990 --> 01:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
because it's part of that facility it
 
01:45:42.229 --> 01:45:42.239 align:start position:0%
could be anything else it could be a
 
01:45:45.510 --> 01:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
a separate classroom section
 
01:45:47.510 --> 01:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
yep could be mr chair can we take a
 
01:45:56.830 --> 01:45:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:56.840 --> 01:48:08.149 align:start position:0%
 
sure

01:48:08.149 --> 01:48:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:10.390 --> 01:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
you guys just came back a little early
 
01:48:13.270 --> 01:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
you have a minute left
 
01:48:15.750 --> 01:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
but uh if you have some pearls of wisdom
 
01:48:18.390 --> 01:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
for us we'd like to hear it
 
01:48:21.510 --> 01:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
um we're
 
01:48:24.870 --> 01:48:24.880 align:start position:0%
we are on a different track um we
 
01:48:28.950 --> 01:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
so but they and i'm trying to make
 
01:48:32.550 --> 01:48:32.560 align:start position:0%
the senate version
 
01:48:35.189 --> 01:48:35.199 align:start position:0%
as close to the house version as i can
 
01:48:36.070 --> 01:48:36.080 align:start position:0%
so what
 
01:48:39.669 --> 01:48:39.679 align:start position:0%
what i'm what i'm proposing is
 
01:48:42.790 --> 01:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
that we use the senate version except
 
01:48:43.750 --> 01:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
for the fact
 
01:48:47.669 --> 01:48:47.679 align:start position:0%
that um i think where i'm caught is the
 
01:48:49.430 --> 01:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
not used for
 
01:48:54.229 --> 01:48:54.239 align:start position:0%
and and so if i'm saying uh means
 
01:48:56.870 --> 01:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
it means a school district i i don't
 
01:48:58.470 --> 01:48:58.480 align:start position:0%
have any problem with the academic
 
01:48:58.480 --> 01:48:59.430 align:start position:0%
have any problem with the academic
purpose

01:48:59.430 --> 01:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
01:49:02.790 --> 01:49:02.800 align:start position:0%
the extracurricular and as as long as
 
01:49:04.550 --> 01:49:04.560 align:start position:0%
those are the
 
01:49:08.470 --> 01:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:12.830 --> 01:49:12.840 align:start position:0%
i was saying this i'm trying to avoid
 
01:49:15.589 --> 01:49:15.599 align:start position:0%
where the in the senate version
 
01:49:18.870 --> 01:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
that we're not just using a building
 
01:49:18.880 --> 01:49:19.589 align:start position:0%
that we're not just using a building
first

01:49:19.589 --> 01:49:19.599 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:49:23.350 --> 01:49:23.360 align:start position:0%
for storage of lunch trays or something
 
01:49:23.990 --> 01:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
like that
 
01:49:27.350 --> 01:49:27.360 align:start position:0%
i i'm trying to eliminate the neg
 
01:49:30.229 --> 01:49:30.239 align:start position:0%
that which is not used and try to make
 
01:49:30.239 --> 01:49:31.510 align:start position:0%
that which is not used and try to make
it

01:49:31.510 --> 01:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:49:35.189 --> 01:49:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:37.109 --> 01:49:37.119 align:start position:0%
and and really that's the difference
 
01:49:38.790 --> 01:49:38.800 align:start position:0%
between the house and the senate
 
01:49:41.990 --> 01:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
the house side says what it can
 
01:49:44.870 --> 01:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
be used for and the and the senate side
 
01:49:46.870 --> 01:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
is saying what it
 
01:49:50.229 --> 01:49:50.239 align:start position:0%
is not being used so would you be okay
 
01:49:52.709 --> 01:49:52.719 align:start position:0%
with something that said so if we're
 
01:49:54.149 --> 01:49:54.159 align:start position:0%
using the senate version
 
01:49:56.070 --> 01:49:56.080 align:start position:0%
yeah in the school building owned by
 
01:49:57.669 --> 01:49:57.679 align:start position:0%
school district which is not used for
 
01:49:59.589 --> 01:49:59.599 align:start position:0%
academic purposes extracurricular
 
01:49:59.599 --> 01:50:00.229 align:start position:0%
academic purposes extracurricular
activities

01:50:00.229 --> 01:50:00.239 align:start position:0%
activities
 
01:50:01.669 --> 01:50:01.679 align:start position:0%
administrative school functions or
 
01:50:05.030 --> 01:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
sports and somewhere in there we define
 
01:50:06.870 --> 01:50:06.880 align:start position:0%
administrative school functions
 
01:50:17.030 --> 01:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:19.589 --> 01:50:19.599 align:start position:0%
you know i use storage as the euphemism
 
01:50:19.599 --> 01:50:22.830 align:start position:0%
you know i use storage as the euphemism
for

01:50:22.830 --> 01:50:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:22.840 --> 01:50:24.070 align:start position:0%
 
anything

01:50:24.070 --> 01:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
anything
 
01:50:26.950 --> 01:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
i'm not i just don't and i'm not
 
01:50:28.229 --> 01:50:28.239 align:start position:0%
accusing of
 
01:50:31.030 --> 01:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
an administrator of doing this but it is
 
01:50:31.040 --> 01:50:31.830 align:start position:0%
an administrator of doing this but it is
possible

01:50:31.830 --> 01:50:31.840 align:start position:0%
possible
 
01:50:34.870 --> 01:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
to circumvent the intent of this by
 
01:50:36.790 --> 01:50:36.800 align:start position:0%
something else i think in the senate it
 
01:50:38.709 --> 01:50:38.719 align:start position:0%
came up with a janitor's office or
 
01:50:39.910 --> 01:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
01:50:42.790 --> 01:50:42.800 align:start position:0%
and that's the idea if somebody is in
 
01:50:43.750 --> 01:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
there does that mean
 
01:50:46.950 --> 01:50:46.960 align:start position:0%
it's it's being used and therefore
 
01:50:50.470 --> 01:50:50.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't qualify but but other than that
 
01:50:53.510 --> 01:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
i'm okay with with
 
01:50:56.550 --> 01:50:56.560 align:start position:0%
with saying that this building
 
01:51:00.070 --> 01:51:00.080 align:start position:0%
um is for those purposes
 
01:51:01.750 --> 01:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
and if it's not being used for those
 
01:51:04.149 --> 01:51:04.159 align:start position:0%
purposes then it's
 
01:51:08.229 --> 01:51:08.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:10.800 --> 01:51:10.810 align:start position:0%
so what i'm hearing is you'd like to say
 
01:51:10.810 --> 01:51:13.350 align:start position:0%
so what i'm hearing is you'd like to say
[Laughter]

01:51:13.350 --> 01:51:13.360 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:51:15.189 --> 01:51:15.199 align:start position:0%
that's what you're sounding like right
 
01:51:16.950 --> 01:51:16.960 align:start position:0%
yeah i think the record is
 
01:51:20.310 --> 01:51:20.320 align:start position:0%
true that we're saying this if it's
 
01:51:22.550 --> 01:51:22.560 align:start position:0%
solely used for storage if somebody has
 
01:51:25.510 --> 01:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
a claim that somebody is
 
01:51:29.189 --> 01:51:29.199 align:start position:0%
i think i i i would like us to just stay
 
01:51:32.149 --> 01:51:32.159 align:start position:0%
with the words that we have
 
01:51:35.510 --> 01:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
and it just needs to be squeezed more uh
 
01:51:38.709 --> 01:51:38.719 align:start position:0%
the definition with uh a tweet
 
01:51:40.550 --> 01:51:40.560 align:start position:0%
then let's do it but let's find the
 
01:51:41.910 --> 01:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
evidence that of what
 
01:51:45.189 --> 01:51:45.199 align:start position:0%
it is we're objecting to
 
01:51:48.550 --> 01:51:48.560 align:start position:0%
i think unused is unused
 
01:51:50.470 --> 01:51:50.480 align:start position:0%
and that's going to be clear and like
 
01:51:52.070 --> 01:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
under under utilized
 
01:51:55.760 --> 01:51:55.770 align:start position:0%
is also part of underutilized
 
01:51:55.770 --> 01:51:57.109 align:start position:0%
is also part of underutilized
[Music]

01:51:57.109 --> 01:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:52:01.589 --> 01:52:01.599 align:start position:0%
hard terms for you and me to agree
 
01:52:04.390 --> 01:52:04.400 align:start position:0%
yeah but we're having trouble defining
 
01:52:06.310 --> 01:52:06.320 align:start position:0%
unused also so but
 
01:52:08.149 --> 01:52:08.159 align:start position:0%
yeah i think we've said if it's not
 
01:52:10.070 --> 01:52:10.080 align:start position:0%
being used for
 
01:52:11.910 --> 01:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
these school functions which are
 
01:52:11.920 --> 01:52:13.589 align:start position:0%
these school functions which are
administrative

01:52:13.589 --> 01:52:13.599 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
01:52:15.589 --> 01:52:15.599 align:start position:0%
sports co-curricular or academic
 
01:52:15.599 --> 01:52:17.510 align:start position:0%
sports co-curricular or academic
purposes

01:52:17.510 --> 01:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
01:52:20.870 --> 01:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
but administrative is it's it's why
 
01:52:25.510 --> 01:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
no i get it and sports is too i mean if
 
01:52:27.910 --> 01:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
you have a whole bunch of classrooms
 
01:52:30.790 --> 01:52:30.800 align:start position:0%
and yet they run a adult education in
 
01:52:30.800 --> 01:52:31.109 align:start position:0%
and yet they run a adult education in
the

01:52:31.109 --> 01:52:31.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:52:35.270 --> 01:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:37.109 --> 01:52:37.119 align:start position:0%
they say okay well we don't have to do
 
01:52:38.790 --> 01:52:38.800 align:start position:0%
that because we're using the gym
 
01:52:41.830 --> 01:52:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:43.189 --> 01:52:43.199 align:start position:0%
and that's the way it works you have
 
01:52:44.950 --> 01:52:44.960 align:start position:0%
community schools programs where
 
01:52:47.830 --> 01:52:47.840 align:start position:0%
right in the evening hours or in the
 
01:52:47.840 --> 01:52:48.310 align:start position:0%
right in the evening hours or in the
right

01:52:48.310 --> 01:52:48.320 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:52:51.270 --> 01:52:51.280 align:start position:0%
meanwhile it's used but meanwhile all of
 
01:52:52.950 --> 01:52:52.960 align:start position:0%
that classroom space doesn't get
 
01:52:52.960 --> 01:52:54.790 align:start position:0%
that classroom space doesn't get
interesting

01:52:54.790 --> 01:52:54.800 align:start position:0%
interesting
 
01:52:57.270 --> 01:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
that's that's what i'm saying that's why
 
01:52:58.950 --> 01:52:58.960 align:start position:0%
you have the ten percent
 
01:53:02.709 --> 01:53:02.719 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah but it's very hard
 
01:53:04.550 --> 01:53:04.560 align:start position:0%
now you've got number five you've done
 
01:53:04.560 --> 01:53:06.790 align:start position:0%
now you've got number five you've done
this

01:53:06.790 --> 01:53:06.800 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:53:09.990 --> 01:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh the number of clock hours in a week
 
01:53:12.070 --> 01:53:12.080 align:start position:0%
and what's your definition of a clock
 
01:53:13.830 --> 01:53:13.840 align:start position:0%
hour or school hour
 
01:53:16.310 --> 01:53:16.320 align:start position:0%
and what's 10 and we change the date
 
01:53:17.990 --> 01:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
back to the 21st
 
01:53:19.910 --> 01:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
so so if we if you take the senate
 
01:53:21.990 --> 01:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
version it changes date back to
 
01:53:23.990 --> 01:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
this july the bill night might not even
 
01:53:38.870 --> 01:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:43.830 --> 01:53:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:45.830 --> 01:53:45.840 align:start position:0%
in the school building authority we're
 
01:53:47.910 --> 01:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
developing that plan of
 
01:53:51.189 --> 01:53:51.199 align:start position:0%
of doing this statewide evaluations of
 
01:53:54.149 --> 01:53:54.159 align:start position:0%
all of the buildings
 
01:53:56.629 --> 01:53:56.639 align:start position:0%
superintendent should know right now by
 
01:53:58.310 --> 01:53:58.320 align:start position:0%
as simple a definition is
 
01:54:01.589 --> 01:54:01.599 align:start position:0%
as what you have in the senate side
 
01:54:03.669 --> 01:54:03.679 align:start position:0%
look they should know in 10 minutes who
 
01:54:05.589 --> 01:54:05.599 align:start position:0%
which buildings so you want it to take
 
01:54:05.599 --> 01:54:06.950 align:start position:0%
which buildings so you want it to take
effect

01:54:06.950 --> 01:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
effect
 
01:54:08.870 --> 01:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
but the first reporting date would be
 
01:54:10.229 --> 01:54:10.239 align:start position:0%
isn't that what we did
 
01:54:13.910 --> 01:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
no well you put it for july 2022
 
01:54:15.910 --> 01:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
for the first recording well i would say
 
01:54:17.430 --> 01:54:17.440 align:start position:0%
july 21
 
01:54:20.709 --> 01:54:20.719 align:start position:0%
that this july they should be able to in
 
01:54:22.629 --> 01:54:22.639 align:start position:0%
two minutes say well we have five
 
01:54:24.709 --> 01:54:24.719 align:start position:0%
buildings it says probably
 
01:54:26.790 --> 01:54:26.800 align:start position:0%
to have an academic plan for the next
 
01:54:29.750 --> 01:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:32.390 --> 01:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
no because there's also the caveat that
 
01:54:33.510 --> 01:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
they can remove
 
01:54:41.109 --> 01:54:41.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:43.030 --> 01:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
they're able to just say we're not going
 
01:54:45.030 --> 01:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
to put it on
 
01:54:48.709 --> 01:54:48.719 align:start position:0%
set right so you know yes yeah
 
01:54:50.870 --> 01:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
fold so that one sentence that you're
 
01:54:52.390 --> 01:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
able to use the house
 
01:54:55.589 --> 01:54:55.599 align:start position:0%
version uh number two and the senate
 
01:54:57.189 --> 01:54:57.199 align:start position:0%
roman one
 
01:55:00.310 --> 01:55:00.320 align:start position:0%
two oh yeah there it is and to find the
 
01:55:02.070 --> 01:55:02.080 align:start position:0%
compromise here
 
01:55:07.189 --> 01:55:07.199 align:start position:0%
seeing that on july 1 2021.
 
01:55:10.310 --> 01:55:10.320 align:start position:0%
now how is that going to get done
 
01:55:14.229 --> 01:55:14.239 align:start position:0%
by that date when this thing gets signed
 
01:55:18.229 --> 01:55:18.239 align:start position:0%
perhaps in july
 
01:55:21.990 --> 01:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
now what did i say on january 1 2022
 
01:55:24.870 --> 01:55:24.880 align:start position:0%
and july 1 of every year thereafter well
 
01:55:24.880 --> 01:55:25.830 align:start position:0%
and july 1 of every year thereafter well
that

01:55:25.830 --> 01:55:25.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:55:29.270 --> 01:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:33.669 --> 01:55:33.679 align:start position:0%
no i i said on january 1
 
01:55:36.870 --> 01:55:36.880 align:start position:0%
a little closer in july one of every
 
01:55:37.750 --> 01:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
year they're at
 
01:55:41.270 --> 01:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
okay or even september one i don't care
 
01:55:47.030 --> 01:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:49.589 --> 01:55:49.599 align:start position:0%
that gives time to put something
 
01:55:49.599 --> 01:55:50.149 align:start position:0%
that gives time to put something
together

01:55:50.149 --> 01:55:50.159 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:55:53.589 --> 01:55:53.599 align:start position:0%
okay with that then i am agreeable yeah
 
01:55:57.990 --> 01:55:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:00.790 --> 01:56:00.800 align:start position:0%
so we're sticking with um the senate
 
01:56:02.470 --> 01:56:02.480 align:start position:0%
version enrollment two
 
01:56:05.669 --> 01:56:05.679 align:start position:0%
but changing the date to january 1
 
01:56:09.589 --> 01:56:09.599 align:start position:0%
2022 and taking the last sentence from
 
01:56:10.790 --> 01:56:10.800 align:start position:0%
the house version
 
01:56:12.830 --> 01:56:12.840 align:start position:0%
and moving that over to the senate
 
01:56:14.950 --> 01:56:14.960 align:start position:0%
version yes
 
01:56:19.750 --> 01:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:23.030 --> 01:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
okay now i i don't know i don't think we
 
01:56:24.709 --> 01:56:24.719 align:start position:0%
discussed that last time
 
01:56:28.229 --> 01:56:28.239 align:start position:0%
okay just yesterday yeah
 
01:56:31.910 --> 01:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
so we're just changing july 1 to january
 
01:56:31.920 --> 01:56:32.629 align:start position:0%
so we're just changing july 1 to january
1

01:56:32.629 --> 01:56:32.639 align:start position:0%
1
 
01:56:35.430 --> 01:56:35.440 align:start position:0%
and then 2000 leading to 2022 essence
 
01:56:35.440 --> 01:56:38.470 align:start position:0%
and then 2000 leading to 2022 essence
right

01:56:38.470 --> 01:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:40.149 --> 01:56:40.159 align:start position:0%
okay representatives on the house side
 
01:56:52.550 --> 01:56:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:55.109 --> 01:56:55.119 align:start position:0%
yes so we're good all we have to do is
 
01:56:56.950 --> 01:56:56.960 align:start position:0%
get that
 
01:57:00.709 --> 01:57:00.719 align:start position:0%
state change so here's my other question
 
01:57:02.390 --> 01:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
we got an instruction the other day that
 
01:57:04.870 --> 01:57:04.880 align:start position:0%
said these can go on consent
 
01:57:08.310 --> 01:57:08.320 align:start position:0%
well it seems to me committee
 
01:57:11.109 --> 01:57:11.119 align:start position:0%
conference we all agree with you what
 
01:57:12.790 --> 01:57:12.800 align:start position:0%
the hell is this consent calendar
 
01:57:14.950 --> 01:57:14.960 align:start position:0%
i i don't know i don't know that's
 
01:57:16.470 --> 01:57:16.480 align:start position:0%
that's a house deal i don't think
 
01:57:18.790 --> 01:57:18.800 align:start position:0%
or not i don't understand that at all
 
01:57:18.800 --> 01:57:22.950 align:start position:0%
or not i don't understand that at all
but

01:57:22.950 --> 01:57:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:25.910 --> 01:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
for um yeah you all got to sign off
 
01:57:27.030 --> 01:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
that's the big deal right
 
01:57:29.910 --> 01:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
and you have to report and i have to put
 
01:57:31.109 --> 01:57:31.119 align:start position:0%
do a report on
 
01:57:33.510 --> 01:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
these two bills today right and i might
 
02:14:47.270 --> 02:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:50.709 --> 02:14:50.719 align:start position:0%
on 242 and we have an amendment
 
02:14:56.069 --> 02:14:56.079 align:start position:0%
in front of us it's 2008 h
 
02:14:58.950 --> 02:14:58.960 align:start position:0%
and i'm looking at that amendment right
 
02:14:58.960 --> 02:14:59.350 align:start position:0%
and i'm looking at that amendment right
now

02:14:59.350 --> 02:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:15:01.589 --> 02:15:01.599 align:start position:0%
and comparing it to what i have here on
 
02:15:03.270 --> 02:15:03.280 align:start position:0%
the amendment for
 
02:15:06.470 --> 02:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
uh senate bill 148 the
 
02:15:09.750 --> 02:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
language on roman 3 here
 
02:15:12.790 --> 02:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
romans 6 and romans 7
 
02:15:17.189 --> 02:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
is identical to the language that we had
 
02:15:19.910 --> 02:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
that we are proposing for 148 so we're
 
02:15:23.109 --> 02:15:23.119 align:start position:0%
on the same page there
 
02:15:25.750 --> 02:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
and then it looks like this uh when
 
02:15:27.350 --> 02:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
we're talking about fiscal class
 
02:15:30.390 --> 02:15:30.400 align:start position:0%
disparity aid it's uh as we
 
02:15:34.069 --> 02:15:34.079 align:start position:0%
talked about in committee
 
02:16:00.069 --> 02:16:00.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:02.390 --> 02:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
for those who might want it i gave this
 
02:16:03.189 --> 02:16:03.199 align:start position:0%
sheet to
 
02:16:07.669 --> 02:16:07.679 align:start position:0%
senator ward that just a few moments ago
 
02:16:10.870 --> 02:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:13.030 --> 02:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
yes this sheet is just for your
 
02:16:13.040 --> 02:16:14.310 align:start position:0%
yes this sheet is just for your
information

02:16:14.310 --> 02:16:14.320 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:16:17.750 --> 02:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
it came from the coal regions lab out of
 
02:16:20.550 --> 02:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
and it you can look at the satellite
 
02:16:20.560 --> 02:16:21.030 align:start position:0%
and it you can look at the satellite
image

02:16:21.030 --> 02:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
image
 
02:16:24.470 --> 02:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
of the north pole back in 1980
 
02:16:27.589 --> 02:16:27.599 align:start position:0%
and look at it in 2012
 
02:16:30.229 --> 02:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
you see we've lost well over half the
 
02:16:30.239 --> 02:16:30.629 align:start position:0%
you see we've lost well over half the
ice

02:16:30.629 --> 02:16:30.639 align:start position:0%
ice
 
02:16:33.190 --> 02:16:33.200 align:start position:0%
on the north pole in just that short
 
02:16:35.030 --> 02:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
time frame
 
02:16:37.509 --> 02:16:37.519 align:start position:0%
and that's what causes these physical
 
02:16:39.270 --> 02:16:39.280 align:start position:0%
biological socioeconomic and
 
02:16:41.030 --> 02:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
geopolitical challenges
 
02:16:44.830 --> 02:16:44.840 align:start position:0%
that we're encountering here with our
 
02:16:44.840 --> 02:16:46.709 align:start position:0%
that we're encountering here with our
environment

02:16:46.709 --> 02:16:46.719 align:start position:0%
environment
 
02:16:50.230 --> 02:16:50.240 align:start position:0%
that's 2012. for me that's 2012.
 
02:16:53.190 --> 02:16:53.200 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah i know it and that's why you
 
02:16:53.200 --> 02:16:53.589 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah i know it and that's why you
know

02:16:53.589 --> 02:16:53.599 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:16:56.870 --> 02:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
we talked earlier in break um
 
02:16:59.030 --> 02:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
how the challenges for those minerals up
 
02:17:00.389 --> 02:17:00.399 align:start position:0%
there in the north pole area and
 
02:17:02.230 --> 02:17:02.240 align:start position:0%
greenland etc are being now challenged
 
02:17:02.240 --> 02:17:02.549 align:start position:0%
greenland etc are being now challenged
by

02:17:02.549 --> 02:17:02.559 align:start position:0%
by
 
02:17:08.870 --> 02:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:12.830 --> 02:17:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:12.840 --> 02:17:15.750 align:start position:0%
 
world

02:17:15.750 --> 02:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
world
 
02:17:24.629 --> 02:17:24.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:39.910 --> 02:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:42.950 --> 02:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
okay so we'll take a vote from the the
 
02:17:44.469 --> 02:17:44.479 align:start position:0%
representative side
 
02:17:48.309 --> 02:17:48.319 align:start position:0%
uh starting with uh represent shaw yes
