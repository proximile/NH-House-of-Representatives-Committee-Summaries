speak with you about uh the department
 
00:11:59.590 --> 00:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
who we are and what we what we do so so
 
00:12:02.509 --> 00:12:02.519 align:start position:0%
um as uh representative McDonald had
 
00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:05.000 align:start position:0%
said my name is Lori Weaver um I was
 
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
thinking I'm in the middle of my term um
 
00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:10.240 align:start position:0%
which is uh four years um I've been with
 
00:12:12.829 --> 00:12:12.839 align:start position:0%
the department for 28 years this year
 
00:12:14.949 --> 00:12:14.959 align:start position:0%
going into my 28th year not all as
 
00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:16.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner um I don't think anyone
 
00:12:19.269 --> 00:12:19.279 align:start position:0%
could survive that um but really uh
 
00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
coming into the department and
 
00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
Leadership positions and in those 28
 
00:12:25.629 --> 00:12:25.639 align:start position:0%
years various roles in the department um
 
00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
and then in 22 um became interim
 
00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner and then 23 became
 
00:12:34.189 --> 00:12:34.199 align:start position:0%
permanent commissioner um so I do have
 
00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
some familiarity with the Department
 
00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:38.680 align:start position:0%
there's no stupid question so please do
 
00:12:42.069 --> 00:12:42.079 align:start position:0%
ask us all questions um I am bringing
 
00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
some materials to share with the
 
00:12:45.269 --> 00:12:45.279 align:start position:0%
assumption that some of the community
 
00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:47.160 align:start position:0%
members are new and may need to know or
 
00:12:48.269 --> 00:12:48.279 align:start position:0%
would like to know a little bit more
 
00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:50.720 align:start position:0%
about the department um the department
 
00:12:55.269 --> 00:12:55.279 align:start position:0%
is large but it is not um something to
 
00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
uh be afraid of in the sense that people
 
00:12:58.629 --> 00:12:58.639 align:start position:0%
always say the department is large and
 
00:13:00.629 --> 00:13:00.639 align:start position:0%
not knowing what that is it's actually
 
00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:02.680 align:start position:0%
hoping today to put that into some
 
00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
bite-sized pieces for you to digest uh
 
00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:07.720 align:start position:0%
two years ago I believe I was here for a
 
00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:11.480 align:start position:0%
meet and greet and at that time I had uh
 
00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
my strategic priorities for the year of
 
00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:16.160 align:start position:0%
23 when I was interim commissioner what
 
00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
we called our road map um so that was
 
00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
basically our strategic plan so what I'm
 
00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
sharing with you today is our 2425 road
 
00:13:27.829 --> 00:13:27.839 align:start position:0%
map commissioner yeah uh do you have any
 
00:13:29.269 --> 00:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
extra copies I don't think we got got
 
00:13:31.509 --> 00:13:31.519 align:start position:0%
enough for the side of the room did
 
00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
everyone get one of these over there the
 
00:13:36.509 --> 00:13:36.519 align:start position:0%
issue is the clerk needs copies and we
 
00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:38.120 align:start position:0%
need copies for the two people who are
 
00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:40.040 align:start position:0%
not here and I will get those we will
 
00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:41.680 align:start position:0%
follow up and get those for you the good
 
00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
news is it's also on our website so
 
00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:46.360 align:start position:0%
folks in the interim um yeah of all of
 
00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:47.800 align:start position:0%
that I wasn't quite sure of the number
 
00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
of uh total number of members
 
00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:54.440 align:start position:0%
um I know that a lot of my staff are
 
00:13:56.389 --> 00:13:56.399 align:start position:0%
here today to be able just to say hello
 
00:13:58.629 --> 00:13:58.639 align:start position:0%
to you and give you um an idea of who
 
00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:00.680 align:start position:0%
they are names with faces and the areas
 
00:14:02.629 --> 00:14:02.639 align:start position:0%
that they cover what I wanted to do with
 
00:14:04.069 --> 00:14:04.079 align:start position:0%
you is just to sort of explain the
 
00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
department a little bit at a high level
 
00:14:07.389 --> 00:14:07.399 align:start position:0%
and then share with you what our
 
00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
priorities are for 24 and 25 um so I'll
 
00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
start with this sheet here that is the
 
00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
two-pager um this basically is sort of
 
00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:17.720 align:start position:0%
the cliffnote version if you will the
 
00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:20.240 align:start position:0%
cheat sheet about the department so at
 
00:14:22.629 --> 00:14:22.639 align:start position:0%
the very top we have our our vision
 
00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
which is it's really quite simple op
 
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
Optimal Health and well-being for
 
00:14:28.269 --> 00:14:28.279 align:start position:0%
everybody our agency is charged with
 
00:14:30.069 --> 00:14:30.079 align:start position:0%
serving our vulnerable populations in
 
00:14:32.829 --> 00:14:32.839 align:start position:0%
the state and we aim that all of our
 
00:14:34.629 --> 00:14:34.639 align:start position:0%
citizens will have Optimal Health and
 
00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
well-being um we have our mission
 
00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:38.240 align:start position:0%
statement and then we have some our Val
 
00:14:40.949 --> 00:14:40.959 align:start position:0%
some of our values we also have what our
 
00:14:42.949 --> 00:14:42.959 align:start position:0%
primary responsibilities are so what
 
00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:44.519 align:start position:0%
does the department do what are we
 
00:14:46.829 --> 00:14:46.839 align:start position:0%
mandated to do required to do whether
 
00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
it's federal or uh through state so
 
00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:51.560 align:start position:0%
protection and prevention so you'll have
 
00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:53.480 align:start position:0%
heard a lot about child protection
 
00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:55.720 align:start position:0%
there's also adult protection services
 
00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
Health disease obviously Medicaid is one
 
00:15:00.509 --> 00:15:00.519 align:start position:0%
of our major funding sources that we use
 
00:15:03.069 --> 00:15:03.079 align:start position:0%
to uh provide a lot of the program
 
00:15:05.509 --> 00:15:05.519 align:start position:0%
services that we have Client Service
 
00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:08.680 align:start position:0%
delivery we actually uh have about 50%
 
00:15:11.389 --> 00:15:11.399 align:start position:0%
of our Workforce is what we call Direct
 
00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:14.240 align:start position:0%
Care and that is providing either some s
 
00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:16.600 align:start position:0%
some form of Case Management Services so
 
00:15:17.829 --> 00:15:17.839 align:start position:0%
you'll think of a child protective
 
00:15:19.389 --> 00:15:19.399 align:start position:0%
service worker or adult protective
 
00:15:21.509 --> 00:15:21.519 align:start position:0%
service worker maybe a Child Support
 
00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
Officer or an eligibility worker but we
 
00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
also have uh 247 facilities uh we have
 
00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:29.519 align:start position:0%
currently have four of them one is in
 
00:15:31.309 --> 00:15:31.319 align:start position:0%
the process of being transitioned over
 
00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:35.240 align:start position:0%
to a different provider um I have staff
 
00:15:37.189 --> 00:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
that provide services so we have some
 
00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:39.160 align:start position:0%
nurses we have Physicians we have
 
00:15:41.269 --> 00:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
clinicians we do contract out some of
 
00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
the Clinical Services of that but we
 
00:15:46.829 --> 00:15:46.839 align:start position:0%
have a robust uh Workforce that provides
 
00:15:49.829 --> 00:15:49.839 align:start position:0%
um the day-to-day skills needed whether
 
00:15:51.629 --> 00:15:51.639 align:start position:0%
you're in a geriatric Psychiatric
 
00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
Hospital such as glencliffe or you're in
 
00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospital uh we have mental
 
00:15:57.670 --> 00:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
health workers we have lnas we have food
 
00:15:59.509 --> 00:15:59.519 align:start position:0%
nutrition and so on
 
00:16:02.069 --> 00:16:02.079 align:start position:0%
um we also have uh Our Youth Development
 
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
Services Center which is down in
 
00:16:06.389 --> 00:16:06.399 align:start position:0%
Manchester so we have direct staff uh uh
 
00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
staff that provide Direct Services down
 
00:16:10.629 --> 00:16:10.639 align:start position:0%
there as well so it's pretty pretty
 
00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:13.160 align:start position:0%
robust and we also because it wouldn't
 
00:16:15.389 --> 00:16:15.399 align:start position:0%
be government without regulatory
 
00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
oversight um we also have that as well
 
00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
so when you think about our nursing
 
00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
facilities our child care facilities are
 
00:16:23.629 --> 00:16:23.639 align:start position:0%
food right we do food licensing
 
00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:26.160 align:start position:0%
restaurant licensing um our nursing
 
00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
facilities so we work and go out and do
 
00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:31.000 align:start position:0%
reviews uses um to make sure that
 
00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
they're following what they're supposed
 
00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:34.360 align:start position:0%
to be doing in their regulations so
 
00:16:36.949 --> 00:16:36.959 align:start position:0%
that's a big part of HHS trying to break
 
00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
it down into sort of a a palatable if
 
00:16:40.829 --> 00:16:40.839 align:start position:0%
you look at it I've listed and give
 
00:16:42.949 --> 00:16:42.959 align:start position:0%
given a little bit of a narrative of
 
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
each of the divisions so it's about it's
 
00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
about eight divisions total six of them
 
00:16:50.509 --> 00:16:50.519 align:start position:0%
are about programmatic uh uh direct
 
00:16:52.629 --> 00:16:52.639 align:start position:0%
policy areas and two of them are really
 
00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:54.680 align:start position:0%
supportive which is like your finance
 
00:16:56.309 --> 00:16:56.319 align:start position:0%
and procurement and then our quality
 
00:16:59.189 --> 00:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
improvement um and Assurance function so
 
00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:02.360 align:start position:0%
we have Behavioral Health we have DCF we
 
00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
have economic stability um uh long-term
 
00:17:09.309 --> 00:17:09.319 align:start position:0%
Support Services Medicaid um public
 
00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
health and of course I mentioned uh
 
00:17:14.549 --> 00:17:14.559 align:start position:0%
quality and finance what I want to point
 
00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:16.360 align:start position:0%
out is it seems like a lot of Divisions
 
00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:19.079 align:start position:0%
but if we think about who we're serving
 
00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
uh it's the families and the kids so all
 
00:17:23.189 --> 00:17:23.199 align:start position:0%
of these divisions wrap around those
 
00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:25.160 align:start position:0%
people that need services so it's not
 
00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:27.240 align:start position:0%
siloed and segmented and if it is we
 
00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
work to try to fix that the point would
 
00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
be is that the staff from each of these
 
00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:34.280 align:start position:0%
divisions work together collectively in
 
00:17:36.669 --> 00:17:36.679 align:start position:0%
an integrated fashion to integrate
 
00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:39.240 align:start position:0%
policy to integrate um Financial
 
00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
supports to integrate Case Management
 
00:17:44.549 --> 00:17:44.559 align:start position:0%
Services advocacy you name it um so
 
00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:46.640 align:start position:0%
that's those pieces all fit together in
 
00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
a choreographed way it isn't just these
 
00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:51.400 align:start position:0%
random We'll add another one on and so
 
00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
we have our finance folks to keep us in
 
00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:54.520 align:start position:0%
check to make sure that we're not
 
00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:55.960 align:start position:0%
spending more than we have been
 
00:17:58.590 --> 00:17:58.600 align:start position:0%
allocated or authorized to do and then
 
00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:00.720 align:start position:0%
we have our quality folks who basically
 
00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
are saying are you doing it the way that
 
00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:04.200 align:start position:0%
you're supposed to be doing it are we
 
00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
accountable to those such as that give
 
00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
us the funding source are we accountable
 
00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:11.000 align:start position:0%
to those that we serve are we doing our
 
00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:13.320 align:start position:0%
due diligence in serving the people of
 
00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so that's sort of how all
 
00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:17.880 align:start position:0%
of those pieces work together my job is
 
00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:19.320 align:start position:0%
to make sure that all the pieces
 
00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
continue to work together and that all
 
00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
these divisions are effective that I
 
00:18:25.029 --> 00:18:25.039 align:start position:0%
have good leaders that can lead each
 
00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:27.320 align:start position:0%
division that hire good staff to provide
 
00:18:29.549 --> 00:18:29.559 align:start position:0%
those services and I sit here in front
 
00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
of you today to tell you I'm very proud
 
00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:33.240 align:start position:0%
that I have an excellent leadership team
 
00:18:34.669 --> 00:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
many of whom you'll be working with
 
00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:36.520 align:start position:0%
throughout session um and you'll get to
 
00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:37.919 align:start position:0%
know them and they make themselves
 
00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
available to you um whenever you have a
 
00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:42.200 align:start position:0%

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
mapap to ask if there's any clarifying
 
00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:56.200 align:start position:0%
questions on structure any
 
00:18:58.310 --> 00:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
questions any questions from division
 
00:18:58.320 --> 00:18:59.950 align:start position:0%
questions any questions from division

if she left she didn't tell me I was
 
00:19:35.909 --> 00:19:35.919 align:start position:0%
hoping she' buy me a beer well that's a
 
00:19:38.549 --> 00:19:38.559 align:start position:0%
conversation for another time uh no uh
 
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
so we have uh a leadership
 
00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:43.880 align:start position:0%
infrastructure which Trish uh is part of
 
00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
that as well as um some other folks that
 
00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
help assure uh all of what I was just
 
00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:49.880 align:start position:0%
saying to make sure that we're we're
 
00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:51.240 align:start position:0%
providing and doing what we're supposed
 
00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:53.960 align:start position:0%
to be doing okay thank
 
00:19:57.669 --> 00:19:57.679 align:start position:0%
you um moving to the the road map I on
 
00:19:59.430 --> 00:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
the back of it isort again it's the
 
00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:01.480 align:start position:0%
cliffnote version the reason I I shared
 
00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:03.400 align:start position:0%
this is to give you an idea of the depth
 
00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:05.000 align:start position:0%
and the breadth of when we're talking
 
00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
about goals what are we actually looking
 
00:20:08.669 --> 00:20:08.679 align:start position:0%
at so that's great that you're going to
 
00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:10.440 align:start position:0%
improve customer service but what
 
00:20:12.549 --> 00:20:12.559 align:start position:0%
specifically are you going to be doing
 
00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
um so let me just walk you through the
 
00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
three circles uh we pretty much put it
 
00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:21.080 align:start position:0%
into three commitments which break down
 
00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:24.200 align:start position:0%
um into 15 initiatives and 43 goals in
 
00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:26.600 align:start position:0%
its entirety of the road map so our
 
00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
first I'd like to start with a darker B
 
00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
the bubble which is invest in people and
 
00:20:33.789 --> 00:20:33.799 align:start position:0%
culture so it has been um a priority of
 
00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
the department that we can't and that
 
00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
they're staying and that they're doing
 
00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:38.840 align:start position:0%
good quality work so you need to invest
 
00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:41.480 align:start position:0%
in that in order to be able to do that
 
00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
uh Second purple bubble is our promote
 
00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:44.990 align:start position:0%
uh Second purple bubble is our promote
thriving

00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
thriving
 
00:20:47.149 --> 00:20:47.159 align:start position:0%
communities um that's where the bulk of
 
00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
our policy work is and our program work
 
00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:52.360 align:start position:0%
so you'll see some examples down below
 
00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:54.320 align:start position:0%
there of initiatives that are happening
 
00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
so if you look at Mission zero I'll give
 
00:20:58.630 --> 00:20:58.640 align:start position:0%
that as an example some of you may or
 
00:20:59.909 --> 00:20:59.919 align:start position:0%
may not have heard about that on the
 
00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
news that's our Ed boarding that's our
 
00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:04.600 align:start position:0%
emergency department boarding so we knew
 
00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh a couple of years ago uh there was
 
00:21:08.149 --> 00:21:08.159 align:start position:0%
some litigation there's always
 
00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:09.880 align:start position:0%
litigation uh we didn't do it because of
 
00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:12.400 align:start position:0%
the litigation um but there's litigation
 
00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:14.840 align:start position:0%
uh to clear out uh emergency rooms and
 
00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:16.480 align:start position:0%
not have folks wait there we all want
 
00:21:17.789 --> 00:21:17.799 align:start position:0%
the same thing we don't want folks
 
00:21:20.269 --> 00:21:20.279 align:start position:0%
sitting in emergency room either uh we
 
00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:22.640 align:start position:0%
created Mission Z which basically was a
 
00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
concerted effort to reduce that number
 
00:21:27.269 --> 00:21:27.279 align:start position:0%
and through particular interventions I'm
 
00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:29.080 align:start position:0%
happy to say to you today that we have
 
00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:31.400 align:start position:0%
reduced significantly not only the
 
00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
number of people that are sitting in EDS
 
00:21:35.909 --> 00:21:35.919 align:start position:0%
but the time that they're sitting there
 
00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:39.640 align:start position:0%
waiting for a bed um that's has taken a
 
00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:42.760 align:start position:0%
lot of work in terms of resources and
 
00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
system transformation but partnership
 
00:21:47.269 --> 00:21:47.279 align:start position:0%
outside of the department we had to
 
00:21:49.269 --> 00:21:49.279 align:start position:0%
actually partner with our Hospital
 
00:21:51.029 --> 00:21:51.039 align:start position:0%
Association with our providers to be
 
00:21:52.549 --> 00:21:52.559 align:start position:0%
able to say how do we work together to
 
00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:55.960 align:start position:0%
make a dent here and we have U we made a
 
00:21:58.149 --> 00:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
significant dent and we have that six
 
00:22:00.669 --> 00:22:00.679 align:start position:0%
course strategies focused around that so
 
00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:02.720 align:start position:0%
that's not just the front door it's also
 
00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:04.440 align:start position:0%
when people are leaving care do they
 
00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
have a place to go do they have a place
 
00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
to live can they sustain and stay there
 
00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
so you can read about that uh in further
 
00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:12.320 align:start position:0%
depth uh within the um within the
 
00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:14.600 align:start position:0%
document itself and I'd be happy to talk
 
00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
to any of you about that as well um we
 
00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
also have a couple other things on there
 
00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
I just you know there's issues around
 
00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:22.120 align:start position:0%
lead there's issues around you know one
 
00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
of our issues is Healthy Mothers Healthy
 
00:22:25.669 --> 00:22:25.679 align:start position:0%
Babies really making sure that people
 
00:22:27.669 --> 00:22:27.679 align:start position:0%
are getting the care that they need
 
00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:29.440 align:start position:0%
before they give give birth when they
 
00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:32.120 align:start position:0%
give birth and postpartum as well um our
 
00:22:34.269 --> 00:22:34.279 align:start position:0%
disability system developmental dis
 
00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
disability system as well strengthening
 
00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:37.960 align:start position:0%
that making sure that folks are getting
 
00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
the services the right services that
 
00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
they need when they need them um access
 
00:22:45.269 --> 00:22:45.279 align:start position:0%
to community care whether that's whether
 
00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:46.840 align:start position:0%
our system of care is whether you're a
 
00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
senior or whether you're a child or a
 
00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:51.880 align:start position:0%
youth or an adolescent we have systems
 
00:22:53.669 --> 00:22:53.679 align:start position:0%
of care that we are responsible for
 
00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
standing up and running to service those
 
00:22:57.710 --> 00:22:57.720 align:start position:0%
needs so there those that's a real chalk
 
00:22:59.830 --> 00:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
full I won't through all of them like I
 
00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:02.440 align:start position:0%
said it's in your in your packet um but
 
00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
that is what we're focusing on and
 
00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
striving and when we look at our budget
 
00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
and we look at our budget priorities our
 
00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:09.720 align:start position:0%
budget priorities back up these
 
00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
initiatives and that the things that we
 
00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
know are going to make a difference to
 
00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
the people in our state so a they're
 
00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
getting care when they need it they're
 
00:23:19.029 --> 00:23:19.039 align:start position:0%
not getting it languishing away in care
 
00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
if they don't need it and that they're
 
00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:23.080 align:start position:0%
in community as much as they can be um
 
00:23:24.909 --> 00:23:24.919 align:start position:0%
the last bubble is improve customer
 
00:23:29.549 --> 00:23:29.559 align:start position:0%
service um we have uh as you can imagine
 
00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:31.960 align:start position:0%
uh a big reach in terms of who we serve
 
00:23:34.029 --> 00:23:34.039 align:start position:0%
and I need to make sure that we as a
 
00:23:36.789 --> 00:23:36.799 align:start position:0%
department are responsive um not only to
 
00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
the people that we serve but all of the
 
00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:41.320 align:start position:0%
systems that are tied in with that um so
 
00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:43.320 align:start position:0%
making sure that it's easy for families
 
00:23:44.789 --> 00:23:44.799 align:start position:0%
to understand how to navigate the
 
00:23:47.549 --> 00:23:47.559 align:start position:0%
department making sure that it's easy
 
00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:51.200 align:start position:0%
for um our provider Network who we rely
 
00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
on to do a lot of our services we draw
 
00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
down money from the feds we don't
 
00:23:56.669 --> 00:23:56.679 align:start position:0%
necessarily provide the service we need
 
00:23:58.549 --> 00:23:58.559 align:start position:0%
somebody to be able to do that we have
 
00:23:59.950 --> 00:23:59.960 align:start position:0%
to have good relationships with our
 
00:24:02.789 --> 00:24:02.799 align:start position:0%
providers to do that the procurement CR
 
00:24:05.549 --> 00:24:05.559 align:start position:0%
process for the state um it's long it's
 
00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:08.320 align:start position:0%
cumbersome working to improve that so if
 
00:24:11.149 --> 00:24:11.159 align:start position:0%
you wanted to as a provider uh bid on a
 
00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
contract it shouldn't be harder than it
 
00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:15.880 align:start position:0%
is to provide the service and sometimes
 
00:24:17.909 --> 00:24:17.919 align:start position:0%
historically it's been that way so we
 
00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
for the last two years I've partnered
 
00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
with our Center for um New Hampshire
 
00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
profit uh nonprofit Association to be
 
00:24:27.789 --> 00:24:27.799 align:start position:0%
able to engage our folks and say how can
 
00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
we do this better how can we make this
 
00:24:32.389 --> 00:24:32.399 align:start position:0%
easier um so that that partnership and
 
00:24:33.909 --> 00:24:33.919 align:start position:0%
that collaboration is extremely
 
00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
important so and constituent complaints
 
00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:39.440 align:start position:0%
um I receive many in a day I read all of
 
00:24:42.549 --> 00:24:42.559 align:start position:0%
them uh respond to all of them uh as
 
00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
quickly as we can um and as thoroughly
 
00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:46.640 align:start position:0%
as we can um and try to take the
 
00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:48.200 align:start position:0%
information and feedback from that and
 
00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:49.880 align:start position:0%
to do some improvement so that's not
 
00:24:52.269 --> 00:24:52.279 align:start position:0%
continuing to happen so this is what
 
00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
we're keeping our eye on over the next
 
00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
uh two years this is a 2425 road map
 
00:24:58.710 --> 00:24:58.720 align:start position:0%
there are some things in here that are
 
00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:00.520 align:start position:0%
longer term there are some things that
 
00:25:02.549 --> 00:25:02.559 align:start position:0%
are shorter term so what we we'll do
 
00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
this spring we'll revisit where we're at
 
00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
we have quarterly progress reports to
 
00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:08.600 align:start position:0%
look at where we're at and then we'll
 
00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:10.520 align:start position:0%
course correct and then we'll set out
 
00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:12.200 align:start position:0%
another road map um probably in the
 
00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:13.480 align:start position:0%
beginning of the summer as well that
 
00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:16.120 align:start position:0%
will chunk out for the next year it's uh
 
00:25:17.909 --> 00:25:17.919 align:start position:0%
sort of the easiest way for us to sort
 
00:25:19.669 --> 00:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
of lay out the work and then attack it
 
00:25:21.269 --> 00:25:21.279 align:start position:0%
and then also have some winds along the
 
00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
way so so I know I've said a lot and I
 
00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
know I talk fast um any questions any
 
00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:30.760 align:start position:0%
any questions from the
 
00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
committee division three U no
 
00:25:36.269 --> 00:25:36.279 align:start position:0%
commissioner thank you very much
 
00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
no apparently no one else is missing
 
00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:41.440 align:start position:0%

um sharing data relative to lid but also

pasas so it it would depend on the the

program and the inquiry uh in order to
 
00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:23.320 align:start position:0%
share data due to you know the the
 
00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
necessity of maintaining privacy and
 
00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:27.080 align:start position:0%

00:32:28.669 --> 00:32:28.679 align:start position:0%
agreement with t yes but certainly we
 
00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
work with them to ensure that data is

had to deal with medical
 
00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
marijuana that was one of the most uh
 
00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
I'd say educational
 
00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:25.480 align:start position:0%
opportunities it was painful at times
 
00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:28.200 align:start position:0%
and Michael was extreme ex remely
 
00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:30.720 align:start position:0%
helpful and anybody that wants to know

you and representative Edwards if you
 
00:33:53.950 --> 00:33:53.960 align:start position:0%
want to briefly introduce division three
 
00:33:57.789 --> 00:33:57.799 align:start position:0%
sure thank you so much I as a former
 
00:34:00.029 --> 00:34:00.039 align:start position:0%
member of a Health and Human Services
 
00:34:02.149 --> 00:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
committee I I really appreciate your
 
00:34:05.230 --> 00:34:05.240 align:start position:0%
hospitality of bringing us in uh I think
 
00:34:08.069 --> 00:34:08.079 align:start position:0%
over the years we figured out that for
 
00:34:10.589 --> 00:34:10.599 align:start position:0%
uh freshman legislators and new people
 
00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:13.800 align:start position:0%
to the uh uh two committees division 3
 
00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:17.240 align:start position:0%
and HHS that it uh it was important to
 
00:34:21.430 --> 00:34:21.440 align:start position:0%
share a general uh philosophy of how
 
00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
hhsa is the policy committee and if uh
 
00:34:28.829 --> 00:34:28.839 align:start position:0%
if this uh committee sees a good policy
 
00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
and it gets it through the house with a
 
00:34:33.669 --> 00:34:33.679 align:start position:0%
if it's got a fiscal note if it spends
 
00:34:36.389 --> 00:34:36.399 align:start position:0%
money it'll come to division three so
 
00:34:39.790 --> 00:34:39.800 align:start position:0%
we're like uh two sides of the same coin
 
00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
your your policy we're Finance um
 
00:34:45.470 --> 00:34:45.480 align:start position:0%
there's always I think been an A A
 
00:34:48.990 --> 00:34:49.000 align:start position:0%
handshake agreement that uh each of our
 
00:34:50.869 --> 00:34:50.879 align:start position:0%
committees would work together talk to
 
00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:52.399 align:start position:0%
each other get to know each other's
 
00:34:56.990 --> 00:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
members collaborate and have um your
 
00:34:58.270 --> 00:34:58.280 align:start position:0%
your committee
 
00:35:00.990 --> 00:35:01.000 align:start position:0%
uh also concerned about fiscal
 
00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:03.560 align:start position:0%
responsibility and our committee being
 
00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:06.200 align:start position:0%
appropriately concerned about whether
 
00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
policies are sustainable and somehow
 
00:35:10.069 --> 00:35:10.079 align:start position:0%
we've figured out how to make it work
 
00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
for the last few years that's that's why
 
00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
I think it was important to have
 
00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
division three here so so that they can
 
00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:18.200 align:start position:0%
learn about the department some of them
 
00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
are brand new to us uh at this point I
 
00:35:24.349 --> 00:35:24.359 align:start position:0%
i' like the division 3 members to stand
 
00:35:27.349 --> 00:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
up and and and speak up and introduce
 
00:35:27.359 --> 00:35:29.390 align:start position:0%
up and and and speak up and introduce
your

00:35:29.390 --> 00:35:29.400 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:35:37.109 --> 00:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:43.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:46.520 align:start position:0%
District represent Gary Daniels Milford
 
00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
this is my 10th term in the house I was
 
00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:52.440 align:start position:0%
nine terms in the on the lb committee
 
00:35:55.390 --> 00:35:55.400 align:start position:0%
and I was in the senate for six years
 
00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:03.960 align:start position:0%
Brian I
 
00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:50.990 --> 00:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
and and so the only one that's not here
 
00:36:55.470 --> 00:36:55.480 align:start position:0%
is U uh the division 3 Vice chair
 
00:36:57.990 --> 00:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
represented Moren Mooney from Mar ma
 
00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
she's she's been a vice chair now for I
 
00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:01.800 align:start position:0%
think this is going to be her third term
 
00:37:05.109 --> 00:37:05.119 align:start position:0%
on division 3 and um she would be here
 
00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:07.240 align:start position:0%
but she had to uh get home I think she's
 
00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:09.280 align:start position:0%
watching us on TV if anyone wants to
 
00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:12.000 align:start position:0%

probably a better word but sometimes you
 
00:47:56.470 --> 00:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
get a constituent complaint and as
 
00:47:57.990 --> 00:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
alleged legislator I don't want to get
 
00:48:00.910 --> 00:48:00.920 align:start position:0%
involved in the personal information but
 
00:48:04.630 --> 00:48:04.640 align:start position:0%
nevertheless I want to be able to uh do
 
00:48:08.549 --> 00:48:08.559 align:start position:0%
my job of handing the issue off with you
 
00:48:11.630 --> 00:48:11.640 align:start position:0%
know some specificity to just have the
 
00:48:14.349 --> 00:48:14.359 align:start position:0%
department doing its its own independent
 
00:48:17.470 --> 00:48:17.480 align:start position:0%
look into whether or not we did our job
 
00:48:19.510 --> 00:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
right you know because it's a big
 
00:48:21.950 --> 00:48:21.960 align:start position:0%
organization lots of people we don't do
 
00:48:24.349 --> 00:48:24.359 align:start position:0%
everything perfect so occasionally it's
 
00:48:27.270 --> 00:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
worth an independent relook what I would
 
00:48:29.790 --> 00:48:29.800 align:start position:0%
like to know is as you know one of the
 
00:48:32.150 --> 00:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
many legislators that may have
 
00:48:35.829 --> 00:48:35.839 align:start position:0%
individual cases brought to us what is
 
00:48:39.790 --> 00:48:39.800 align:start position:0%
the methodology we should use to to turn
 
00:48:42.870 --> 00:48:42.880 align:start position:0%
this over to a responsible accountable
 
00:48:46.470 --> 00:48:46.480 align:start position:0%
individual who could ensure that a
 
00:48:50.109 --> 00:48:50.119 align:start position:0%
relook is done properly uh and again I
 
00:48:53.069 --> 00:48:53.079 align:start position:0%
don't want personal health information
 
00:48:55.069 --> 00:48:55.079 align:start position:0%
uh I just need to know at the end of the
 
00:48:58.710 --> 00:48:58.720 align:start position:0%
day uh do we think we did this right and
 
00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
if we didn't are we working to resolve
 
00:49:03.030 --> 00:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
it I kind of need that sort of binary
 
00:49:05.309 --> 00:49:05.319 align:start position:0%
answer thank you for the question
 
00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:08.240 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards so I receive
 
00:49:13.630 --> 00:49:13.640 align:start position:0%
inquiries from uh many uh frequently and
 
00:49:16.109 --> 00:49:16.119 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Williams is also available and
 
00:49:17.670 --> 00:49:17.680 align:start position:0%
receives some of those inquiries which
 
00:49:21.030 --> 00:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
he often forwards to me uh Mr Litman
 
00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
also receives inquiries that uh very
 
00:49:26.190 --> 00:49:26.200 align:start position:0%
many of them get forwarded to me to
 
00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:27.430 align:start position:0%
many of them get forwarded to me to
address

00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
address
 
00:49:29.870 --> 00:49:29.880 align:start position:0%
I would not provide you with detailed
 
00:49:32.750 --> 00:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
information about those individuals my
 
00:49:35.230 --> 00:49:35.240 align:start position:0%
role is to make sure that their needs
 
00:49:37.349 --> 00:49:37.359 align:start position:0%
are addressed their questions are
 
00:49:38.789 --> 00:49:38.799 align:start position:0%
answered and that they have the
 
00:49:40.990 --> 00:49:41.000 align:start position:0%
information that they are looking for
 
00:49:43.430 --> 00:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
that we take care of
 
00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
them so for clarification regardless of
 
00:49:49.870 --> 00:49:49.880 align:start position:0%
where in the department the complaint
 
00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
might best be sourced you would be the
 
00:49:54.990 --> 00:49:55.000 align:start position:0%
front door you and Mr Williams would be
 
00:49:56.670 --> 00:49:56.680 align:start position:0%
the front door for the entire department
 
00:49:59.589 --> 00:49:59.599 align:start position:0%
department and you will sort it out on
 
00:50:01.750 --> 00:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
who should be looking into it we can
 
00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:04.160 align:start position:0%

00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:33.480 align:start position:0%

00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
anytime thank you good to have you thank
 
00:50:40.589 --> 00:50:40.599 align:start position:0%
you um just to open it up I'm Henry
 
00:50:42.190 --> 00:50:42.200 align:start position:0%
Litman I'm the state's Medicaid director
 
00:50:43.990 --> 00:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
I've been in that role now a little over
 
00:50:47.109 --> 00:50:47.119 align:start position:0%
seven years um I report to an Landry who
 
00:50:50.750 --> 00:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
is the associate commissioner um and um
 
00:50:53.549 --> 00:50:53.559 align:start position:0%
I will introduce more of the team as I
 
00:50:55.470 --> 00:50:55.480 align:start position:0%
go through uh the little slide deck I
 
00:50:58.470 --> 00:50:58.480 align:start position:0%
have here um the walkway
 
00:51:01.150 --> 00:51:01.160 align:start position:0%
piece um that's being handed out right
 
00:51:02.670 --> 00:51:02.680 align:start position:0%
now is just so you have a reference if
 
00:51:04.109 --> 00:51:04.119 align:start position:0%
you want to put it in one of your
 
00:51:05.870 --> 00:51:05.880 align:start position:0%
notebooks or something so you know how
 
00:51:07.710 --> 00:51:07.720 align:start position:0%
to get a hold of some of the key people
 
00:51:09.870 --> 00:51:09.880 align:start position:0%
in the Medicaid
 
00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:12.950 align:start position:0%
in the Medicaid
division

00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:15.510 --> 00:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
um so I think it it can be a little bit
 
00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:17.880 align:start position:0%
confusing and um of like who to go to
 
00:51:20.349 --> 00:51:20.359 align:start position:0%
For What and I I'm glad that Karen spoke
 
00:51:22.549 --> 00:51:22.559 align:start position:0%
to that but
 
00:51:27.190 --> 00:51:27.200 align:start position:0%
uh the um the Medicaid division provides
 
00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:27.950 align:start position:0%
uh the um the Medicaid division provides
a

00:51:27.950 --> 00:51:27.960 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:51:30.190 --> 00:51:30.200 align:start position:0%
service which you probably be more
 
00:51:32.549 --> 00:51:32.559 align:start position:0%
familiar to most of you which is the
 
00:51:35.390 --> 00:51:35.400 align:start position:0%
like the health insurance part of of
 
00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:38.640 align:start position:0%
what we provide the Medicaid Program um
 
00:51:40.870 --> 00:51:40.880 align:start position:0%
the help what you would probably um
 
00:51:42.789 --> 00:51:42.799 align:start position:0%
recognize as being the typical thing
 
00:51:45.030 --> 00:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
when you have your own health
 
00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
insurance we also provide um uh
 
00:51:52.150 --> 00:51:52.160 align:start position:0%
Financial Technical Resources to support
 
00:51:54.829 --> 00:51:54.839 align:start position:0%
other divisions and I'll I'll go into
 
00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
that a little bit more in a moment but
 
00:51:59.230 --> 00:51:59.240 align:start position:0%
just in terms of the sort of the heads
 
00:52:01.870 --> 00:52:01.880 align:start position:0%
of the the Medicaid team are myself from
 
00:52:05.789 --> 00:52:05.799 align:start position:0%
a program standpoint um I'm on slide to
 
00:52:08.990 --> 00:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
um an Athena gagan who is um the
 
00:52:11.710 --> 00:52:11.720 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Finance director um I've
 
00:52:14.069 --> 00:52:14.079 align:start position:0%
included below that more probably for
 
00:52:16.510 --> 00:52:16.520 align:start position:0%
division three kind of where you might
 
00:52:20.069 --> 00:52:20.079 align:start position:0%
find some of the key um Financial unit
 
00:52:23.950 --> 00:52:23.960 align:start position:0%
identifiers unique identifiers um in
 
00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:26.240 align:start position:0%
terms of the policy team leads on slide
 
00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:27.109 align:start position:0%
terms of the policy team leads on slide
three

00:52:27.109 --> 00:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
David chy uh is the Deputy Medicaid
 
00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:33.960 align:start position:0%
director and um he'll there's a lot for
 
00:52:35.670 --> 00:52:35.680 align:start position:0%
us to cover in the legislature at times
 
00:52:38.309 --> 00:52:38.319 align:start position:0%
so either one of us I think can handle
 
00:52:39.710 --> 00:52:39.720 align:start position:0%
any of your questions if we don't have
 
00:52:41.589 --> 00:52:41.599 align:start position:0%
the answer we'll certainly come back
 
00:52:43.829 --> 00:52:43.839 align:start position:0%
with it researched
 
00:52:47.349 --> 00:52:47.359 align:start position:0%
um Olivia May is our director of
 
00:52:48.990 --> 00:52:49.000 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Enterprise development and
 
00:52:51.510 --> 00:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
really what that is is making sure that
 
00:52:53.910 --> 00:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
both from the technology side and from
 
00:52:56.069 --> 00:52:56.079 align:start position:0%
the different program areas that were
 
00:52:58.789 --> 00:52:58.799 align:start position:0%
inte ating appropriately with like the
 
00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
various divisions within the department
 
00:53:04.230 --> 00:53:04.240 align:start position:0%
particularly as they use Medicaid
 
00:53:06.870 --> 00:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
funds um Rob Barry I believe in the is
 
00:53:08.589 --> 00:53:08.599 align:start position:0%
in the back here who is our Medicaid
 
00:53:08.599 --> 00:53:09.589 align:start position:0%
in the back here who is our Medicaid
legal

00:53:09.589 --> 00:53:09.599 align:start position:0%
legal
 
00:53:13.309 --> 00:53:13.319 align:start position:0%
counsel um Dr Finny who's our Medicaid
 
00:53:15.150 --> 00:53:15.160 align:start position:0%
medical director I think a lot of you
 
00:53:18.150 --> 00:53:18.160 align:start position:0%
know her um a piece of news which is
 
00:53:19.870 --> 00:53:19.880 align:start position:0%
good for her but not great for us is
 
00:53:21.829 --> 00:53:21.839 align:start position:0%
that she will be retiring um in the
 
00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:27.280 align:start position:0%
coming year here um and um Don uh Landry
 
00:53:29.349 --> 00:53:29.359 align:start position:0%
who is our policy administrator I know
 
00:53:33.470 --> 00:53:33.480 align:start position:0%
she is not here um Peg Clifford and Lisa
 
00:53:35.870 --> 00:53:35.880 align:start position:0%
fan are our Pharmacy director and
 
00:53:38.990 --> 00:53:39.000 align:start position:0%
pharmacy specialist the reason um you
 
00:53:42.069 --> 00:53:42.079 align:start position:0%
know the Medicaid Program about 31% of
 
00:53:44.309 --> 00:53:44.319 align:start position:0%
the expenditures within the Managed Care
 
00:53:47.349 --> 00:53:47.359 align:start position:0%
Program are uh drugs and pharmaceuticals
 
00:53:51.309 --> 00:53:51.319 align:start position:0%
and Gene therapies and um it's in the
 
00:53:52.870 --> 00:53:52.880 align:start position:0%
seven years that I've been here it's
 
00:53:55.789 --> 00:53:55.799 align:start position:0%
almost doubled in terms of of that and I
 
00:53:58.549 --> 00:53:58.559 align:start position:0%
think in the the private sector you see
 
00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:00.480 align:start position:0%
all these commercials on TV about all
 
00:54:02.349 --> 00:54:02.359 align:start position:0%
these different drugs that are out there
 
00:54:04.549 --> 00:54:04.559 align:start position:0%
there that's one element of it but there
 
00:54:07.309 --> 00:54:07.319 align:start position:0%
are a lot of unique Gene therapies um
 
00:54:09.390 --> 00:54:09.400 align:start position:0%
and cell therapies that are coming
 
00:54:12.069 --> 00:54:12.079 align:start position:0%
available that can really um
 
00:54:15.309 --> 00:54:15.319 align:start position:0%
particularly with children um deal with
 
00:54:18.510 --> 00:54:18.520 align:start position:0%
conditions that change the trajectory of
 
00:54:20.670 --> 00:54:20.680 align:start position:0%
what types of support they need in
 
00:54:24.309 --> 00:54:24.319 align:start position:0%
life I don't know if pig or Lisa
 
00:54:27.069 --> 00:54:27.079 align:start position:0%
here okay
 
00:54:30.910 --> 00:54:30.920 align:start position:0%
um so uh slide four is a brief overview
 
00:54:35.589 --> 00:54:35.599 align:start position:0%
of what we um what we do um we again
 
00:54:38.990 --> 00:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
that we oversee the Managed Care
 
00:54:42.670 --> 00:54:42.680 align:start position:0%
program that delivers the services and
 
00:54:45.190 --> 00:54:45.200 align:start position:0%
the various service lines that are
 
00:54:48.069 --> 00:54:48.079 align:start position:0%
available probably most notably is we
 
00:54:50.589 --> 00:54:50.599 align:start position:0%
describe everything other than Medicaid
 
00:54:52.109 --> 00:54:52.119 align:start position:0%
expansion which is the granted Advantage
 
00:54:54.069 --> 00:54:54.079 align:start position:0%
Healthcare program is what we call the
 
00:54:55.710 --> 00:54:55.720 align:start position:0%
standard Medicaid Program and then
 
00:54:58.789 --> 00:54:58.799 align:start position:0%
there's the granted Advantage Healthcare
 
00:54:58.799 --> 00:55:01.710 align:start position:0%
there's the granted Advantage Healthcare
program

00:55:01.710 --> 00:55:01.720 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:55:05.270 --> 00:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
um we uh as I mentioned earlier we're we
 
00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
we deliver those and oversee those parts
 
00:55:11.789 --> 00:55:11.799 align:start position:0%
of the the program but we also work with
 
00:55:14.030 --> 00:55:14.040 align:start position:0%
the other divisions for the Medicaid
 
00:55:16.789 --> 00:55:16.799 align:start position:0%
services that they provide there there's
 
00:55:21.270 --> 00:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
Financial eligibility which um Hebert's
 
00:55:24.230 --> 00:55:24.240 align:start position:0%
uh division oversees the administration
 
00:55:26.990 --> 00:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
of we help develop the policy
 
00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
collaboratively with them to administer
 
00:55:33.789 --> 00:55:33.799 align:start position:0%
that based on state and federal rules um
 
00:55:35.230 --> 00:55:35.240 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:55:38.710 --> 00:55:38.720 align:start position:0%
secondly um with respect to eligibility
 
00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
there's also for like long-term care
 
00:55:43.390 --> 00:55:43.400 align:start position:0%
there's Al and Home and Community Based
 
00:55:46.589 --> 00:55:46.599 align:start position:0%
Services there's also medical um uh
 
00:55:49.630 --> 00:55:49.640 align:start position:0%
eligibility which um comes into play
 
00:55:51.510 --> 00:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
with the division of long-term services
 
00:55:54.029 --> 00:55:54.039 align:start position:0%
and support so uh Melissa Hardy who
 
00:55:56.390 --> 00:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
heads that Karen and I work very closely
 
00:55:59.190 --> 00:55:59.200 align:start position:0%
together um and making sure that the
 
00:56:02.270 --> 00:56:02.280 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Eligibility the delivery of the
 
00:56:04.150 --> 00:56:04.160 align:start position:0%
service are
 
00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:06.549 align:start position:0%
service are
accomplished

00:56:06.549 --> 00:56:06.559 align:start position:0%
accomplished
 
00:56:11.029 --> 00:56:11.039 align:start position:0%
um I also included a slide five we had I
 
00:56:12.910 --> 00:56:12.920 align:start position:0%
think members of division three and
 
00:56:15.430 --> 00:56:15.440 align:start position:0%
maybe HHS may remember if you were here
 
00:56:17.710 --> 00:56:17.720 align:start position:0%
uh last year that um there was some
 
00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
discussion about how long of a
 
00:56:22.190 --> 00:56:22.200 align:start position:0%
procurement we should would go through
 
00:56:24.470 --> 00:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
uh in along with the discussion around
 
00:56:26.309 --> 00:56:26.319 align:start position:0%
the reauthorization of Medicaid
 
00:56:27.990 --> 00:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
expansion Grant Advantage Healthcare
 
00:56:30.750 --> 00:56:30.760 align:start position:0%
program this is just highlighting the
 
00:56:33.750 --> 00:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
new procurement um time frame that was
 
00:56:37.029 --> 00:56:37.039 align:start position:0%
put in place and also um some of the key
 
00:56:40.390 --> 00:56:40.400 align:start position:0%
features that were added to or or
 
00:56:44.230 --> 00:56:44.240 align:start position:0%
revised as part of the the um the new
 
00:56:46.589 --> 00:56:46.599 align:start position:0%
Managed Care
 
00:56:50.270 --> 00:56:50.280 align:start position:0%
Program um slide
 
00:56:54.510 --> 00:56:54.520 align:start position:0%
six are um policy matters that may be of
 
00:56:57.349 --> 00:56:57.359 align:start position:0%
interest to either division three or HHS
 
00:56:59.069 --> 00:56:59.079 align:start position:0%
that you'll probably hear about this
 
00:57:02.109 --> 00:57:02.119 align:start position:0%
session one that is I think a carry
 
00:57:04.430 --> 00:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
forward from last session is the
 
00:57:07.069 --> 00:57:07.079 align:start position:0%
disproportionate share program and the
 
00:57:10.950 --> 00:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
Medicaid enhancement tax program that uh
 
00:57:12.430 --> 00:57:12.440 align:start position:0%
uh was one of the last items that was
 
00:57:14.670 --> 00:57:14.680 align:start position:0%
dealt with last session but not not
 
00:57:17.950 --> 00:57:17.960 align:start position:0%
fully um and I expect that we'll see
 
00:57:21.190 --> 00:57:21.200 align:start position:0%
legislation in this session um Medicaid
 
00:57:23.990 --> 00:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
to schools program is another program
 
00:57:28.630 --> 00:57:28.640 align:start position:0%
that we administer um I know um we're
 
00:57:32.910 --> 00:57:32.920 align:start position:0%
working in this next year to to uh
 
00:57:36.870 --> 00:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
address how schools do their claiming
 
00:57:41.150 --> 00:57:41.160 align:start position:0%
for um the Medicaid match um we believe
 
00:57:43.109 --> 00:57:43.119 align:start position:0%
there's a greater opportunity in that
 
00:57:45.270 --> 00:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
space which could help school districts
 
00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
and local um communities um uh receive
 
00:57:51.710 --> 00:57:51.720 align:start position:0%
more dollars for the services that they
 
00:57:55.109 --> 00:57:55.119 align:start position:0%
provide that are Medicaid eligible um
 
00:57:56.870 --> 00:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
the the method that New Hampshire is
 
00:58:00.510 --> 00:58:00.520 align:start position:0%
using today sunsets federally in June of
 
00:58:03.309 --> 00:58:03.319 align:start position:0%
26 so we applied for and received a
 
00:58:06.990 --> 00:58:07.000 align:start position:0%
grant to help facilitate that transition
 
00:58:10.270 --> 00:58:10.280 align:start position:0%
um and we're currently in request for
 
00:58:14.230 --> 00:58:14.240 align:start position:0%
proposal uh uh we have proposals in that
 
00:58:16.510 --> 00:58:16.520 align:start position:0%
we're evaluating for uh technical
 
00:58:19.630 --> 00:58:19.640 align:start position:0%
support to help uh make that transition
 
00:58:21.990 --> 00:58:22.000 align:start position:0%
so that schools can continue to claim
 
00:58:23.789 --> 00:58:23.799 align:start position:0%
and hopefully be able to claim more for
 
00:58:27.029 --> 00:58:27.039 align:start position:0%
the work that's being done there
 
00:58:30.029 --> 00:58:30.039 align:start position:0%
um slide seven and eight are some um
 
00:58:31.910 --> 00:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
views on enrollment I won't go through
 
00:58:34.270 --> 00:58:34.280 align:start position:0%
it in detail but would say that one of
 
00:58:36.270 --> 00:58:36.280 align:start position:0%
the key issues that we talked about last
 
00:58:39.150 --> 00:58:39.160 align:start position:0%
session was the uh Federal Public Health
 
00:58:40.990 --> 00:58:41.000 align:start position:0%
Emergency and continuous Medicaid
 
00:58:43.750 --> 00:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
enrollment our roles grow to grew to
 
00:58:48.309 --> 00:58:48.319 align:start position:0%
over 251,000 um today they're just over
 
00:58:51.349 --> 00:58:51.359 align:start position:0%
184 they've been fluctuating between 182
 
00:58:55.109 --> 00:58:55.119 align:start position:0%
and 184 over the last number of months
 
00:58:56.710 --> 00:58:56.720 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
00:58:58.029 --> 00:58:58.039 align:start position:0%
you may have heard of the concept of the
 
00:59:00.549 --> 00:59:00.559 align:start position:0%
unwine which is
 
00:59:02.950 --> 00:59:02.960 align:start position:0%
um when the public health emergency
 
00:59:05.990 --> 00:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
ended we needed to um go back and this
 
00:59:08.589 --> 00:59:08.599 align:start position:0%
was a big task and a big lift for Mrs
 
00:59:10.829 --> 00:59:10.839 align:start position:0%
Hebert's division in terms of
 
00:59:14.829 --> 00:59:14.839 align:start position:0%
reprocessing um eligibility um and doing
 
00:59:17.549 --> 00:59:17.559 align:start position:0%
the verifications that go with that we
 
00:59:20.190 --> 00:59:20.200 align:start position:0%
were one of the um first States one of
 
00:59:21.870 --> 00:59:21.880 align:start position:0%
the first four states to be able to
 
00:59:23.950 --> 00:59:23.960 align:start position:0%
begin that process and one of the
 
00:59:28.190 --> 00:59:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:31.870 --> 00:59:31.880 align:start position:0%
um and uh in terms of Pharmacy I think
 
00:59:34.630 --> 00:59:34.640 align:start position:0%
um we um hope to see some legislation
 
00:59:38.390 --> 00:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
this session about um how we can acquire
 
00:59:40.990 --> 00:59:41.000 align:start position:0%
uh drugs within the Medicaid Program
 
00:59:43.430 --> 00:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
more coste effectively than we do today
 
00:59:45.630 --> 00:59:45.640 align:start position:0%
for um a cost savings which I hope would
 
00:59:49.750 --> 00:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
be well received by division three um we
 
00:59:53.270 --> 00:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
last session um implemented the Medicaid
 
00:59:55.510 --> 00:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
provider rate increases which I've been
 
00:59:58.029 --> 00:59:58.039 align:start position:0%
in healthare care in New Hampshire for
 
01:00:00.109 --> 01:00:00.119 align:start position:0%
more than 30 years and they were the
 
01:00:02.029 --> 01:00:02.039 align:start position:0%
largest increases that I think that
 
01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
Medicaid has received in in my lifetime
 
01:00:07.029 --> 01:00:07.039 align:start position:0%
in Medicaid and and in healthcare in New
 
01:00:09.150 --> 01:00:09.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um but we've we've completed
 
01:00:12.390 --> 01:00:12.400 align:start position:0%
that process um the legislature
 
01:00:14.390 --> 01:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
obviously you all know that granted
 
01:00:16.349 --> 01:00:16.359 align:start position:0%
Advantage was reauthorized last session
 
01:00:18.430 --> 01:00:18.440 align:start position:0%
till till
 
01:00:22.630 --> 01:00:22.640 align:start position:0%
2030 ad Del Dental was implemented last
 
01:00:26.309 --> 01:00:26.319 align:start position:0%
session um we we really appreciate both
 
01:00:28.910 --> 01:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
HHS and division 3 for their support and
 
01:00:31.230 --> 01:00:31.240 align:start position:0%
working through the issues there um the
 
01:00:33.710 --> 01:00:33.720 align:start position:0%
program I think is continuing to build
 
01:00:35.549 --> 01:00:35.559 align:start position:0%
and and strengthened and we be happy to
 
01:00:37.870 --> 01:00:37.880 align:start position:0%
provide uh periodic reports to the
 
01:00:41.950 --> 01:00:41.960 align:start position:0%
committee and um and let you know how
 
01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:43.549 align:start position:0%
committee and um and let you know how
we're

01:00:43.549 --> 01:00:43.559 align:start position:0%
we're
 
01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
progressing um one of the waivers that
 
01:00:52.870 --> 01:00:52.880 align:start position:0%
uh that the state has is called an 11:15
 
01:00:56.589 --> 01:00:56.599 align:start position:0%
waiver um what that
 
01:01:00.349 --> 01:01:00.359 align:start position:0%
does in it was renewed in July of
 
01:01:04.069 --> 01:01:04.079 align:start position:0%
2024 um what was renewed component was
 
01:01:07.069 --> 01:01:07.079 align:start position:0%
we inpatient substance use disorder and
 
01:01:10.710 --> 01:01:10.720 align:start position:0%
impatient psychiatric care um the
 
01:01:12.349 --> 01:01:12.359 align:start position:0%
federal government had an opportunity
 
01:01:15.470 --> 01:01:15.480 align:start position:0%
for the state to draw a higher match on
 
01:01:18.549 --> 01:01:18.559 align:start position:0%
those Services um with the understanding
 
01:01:21.230 --> 01:01:21.240 align:start position:0%
that we would use the additional money
 
01:01:24.029 --> 01:01:24.039 align:start position:0%
to uh maintain our community based and
 
01:01:25.670 --> 01:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
strengthen our Community Based Services
 
01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:26.750 align:start position:0%
strengthen our Community Based Services
which

01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:01:30.109 --> 01:01:30.119 align:start position:0%
um a lot of that has like our mobile
 
01:01:31.870 --> 01:01:31.880 align:start position:0%
crisis service and I let Behavioral
 
01:01:33.549 --> 01:01:33.559 align:start position:0%
Health talk about what what they're
 
01:01:34.829 --> 01:01:34.839 align:start position:0%
doing but there have been a lot of
 
01:01:35.990 --> 01:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
things that have been strengthened in
 
01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
our mental health system to prevent
 
01:01:41.750 --> 01:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
boarding and to um allow services to
 
01:01:43.270 --> 01:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
happen within the community as opposed
 
01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:44.670 align:start position:0%
happen within the community as opposed
to

01:01:44.670 --> 01:01:44.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:46.430 align:start position:0%
to
institutional

01:01:46.430 --> 01:01:46.440 align:start position:0%
institutional
 
01:01:51.829 --> 01:01:51.839 align:start position:0%
um uh a new thing that was uh um if you
 
01:01:54.630 --> 01:01:54.640 align:start position:0%
will generated from discussions with the
 
01:01:56.589 --> 01:01:56.599 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections
 
01:01:58.910 --> 01:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
um was to be able to provide what we're
 
01:02:02.710 --> 01:02:02.720 align:start position:0%
calling Community re-entry services for
 
01:02:07.029 --> 01:02:07.039 align:start position:0%
adults what um what that initiative is
 
01:02:10.150 --> 01:02:10.160 align:start position:0%
intended to do today there's a federal
 
01:02:12.430 --> 01:02:12.440 align:start position:0%
exclusion for paying for any Services
 
01:02:15.549 --> 01:02:15.559 align:start position:0%
behind uh the walls of a of a
 
01:02:19.430 --> 01:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
prison um and except for an inpatient
 
01:02:22.549 --> 01:02:22.559 align:start position:0%
admission at a hospital what we're what
 
01:02:24.190 --> 01:02:24.200 align:start position:0%
we've been authorized to do here will be
 
01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:26.920 align:start position:0%
something that will be of benefit to to
 
01:02:30.109 --> 01:02:30.119 align:start position:0%
um our correction system both at a state
 
01:02:31.470 --> 01:02:31.480 align:start position:0%
and county level
 
01:02:33.829 --> 01:02:33.839 align:start position:0%
ultimately we'll be able to provide a
 
01:02:36.950 --> 01:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
limited uh benefit for people who have
 
01:02:38.829 --> 01:02:38.839 align:start position:0%
mental health disorders and substance
 
01:02:42.269 --> 01:02:42.279 align:start position:0%
use disorders to make sure that um the
 
01:02:44.990 --> 01:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
transition from behind the walls to the
 
01:02:47.549 --> 01:02:47.559 align:start position:0%
community that there's a carefully
 
01:02:51.269 --> 01:02:51.279 align:start position:0%
planned transition um operated through a
 
01:02:53.510 --> 01:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
collaboration between the Department of
 
01:02:56.390 --> 01:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
Corrections or syc to start with we
 
01:02:59.029 --> 01:02:59.039 align:start position:0%
began January 1st and implementing this
 
01:03:00.789 --> 01:03:00.799 align:start position:0%
at at those two levels and we'll be
 
01:03:01.990 --> 01:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
moving to the counties we've been
 
01:03:04.710 --> 01:03:04.720 align:start position:0%
meeting with each um County to
 
01:03:06.269 --> 01:03:06.279 align:start position:0%
understand where they are but for
 
01:03:07.670 --> 01:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
sentenc individuals when they're
 
01:03:10.430 --> 01:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
released in the community that um
 
01:03:12.029 --> 01:03:12.039 align:start position:0%
they'll have the medications that they
 
01:03:15.150 --> 01:03:15.160 align:start position:0%
need um that they'll have their doctors
 
01:03:17.549 --> 01:03:17.559 align:start position:0%
or other providers situated that they
 
01:03:18.829 --> 01:03:18.839 align:start position:0%
can actually have some intake
 
01:03:22.349 --> 01:03:22.359 align:start position:0%
appointments behind the wall so that um
 
01:03:25.390 --> 01:03:25.400 align:start position:0%
the data that that uh the council and
 
01:03:26.670 --> 01:03:26.680 align:start position:0%
state government has found about New
 
01:03:29.829 --> 01:03:29.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire a lot of recidivism in our um
 
01:03:32.950 --> 01:03:32.960 align:start position:0%
County and state system are people who
 
01:03:34.670 --> 01:03:34.680 align:start position:0%
have unmet Healthcare needs you know
 
01:03:37.029 --> 01:03:37.039 align:start position:0%
they're they're hit the street they
 
01:03:39.549 --> 01:03:39.559 align:start position:0%
don't they you know they need either a
 
01:03:42.789 --> 01:03:42.799 align:start position:0%
psychiatric medicine or or a um medicine
 
01:03:44.910 --> 01:03:44.920 align:start position:0%
to treat their substance use disorder
 
01:03:46.589 --> 01:03:46.599 align:start position:0%
and if they don't have those things it
 
01:03:48.230 --> 01:03:48.240 align:start position:0%
can end up in our emergency rooms which
 
01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
is the most expensive place to do it um
 
01:03:54.150 --> 01:03:54.160 align:start position:0%
and so um this initially came from uh
 
01:03:56.710 --> 01:03:56.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner Hanks in terms of asking us
 
01:03:58.190 --> 01:03:58.200 align:start position:0%
to apply for it and it went through the
 
01:04:01.190 --> 01:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
process of approval to be able to apply
 
01:04:04.029 --> 01:04:04.039 align:start position:0%
then also Congress um in
 
01:04:08.029 --> 01:04:08.039 align:start position:0%
20123 for for youth um are requiring all
 
01:04:10.710 --> 01:04:10.720 align:start position:0%
states to implement a limited benefit
 
01:04:13.309 --> 01:04:13.319 align:start position:0%
program as well for individuals who are
 
01:04:17.230 --> 01:04:17.240 align:start position:0%
children or um up to uh uh 21 or up to
 
01:04:20.309 --> 01:04:20.319 align:start position:0%
26 if their form of foster care and it's
 
01:04:21.710 --> 01:04:21.720 align:start position:0%
a little bit different than the adult
 
01:04:23.789 --> 01:04:23.799 align:start position:0%
program where it's not just limited to
 
01:04:25.470 --> 01:04:25.480 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder and mental health
 
01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:26.309 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder and mental health
conditions

01:04:26.309 --> 01:04:26.319 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
01:04:30.390 --> 01:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
but to make sure that um the types of
 
01:04:32.950 --> 01:04:32.960 align:start position:0%
things that you'd want to see a child
 
01:04:35.549 --> 01:04:35.559 align:start position:0%
have preventative screenings for ETC
 
01:04:36.750 --> 01:04:36.760 align:start position:0%
that their health care needs are
 
01:04:40.230 --> 01:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
identified before they leave the setting
 
01:04:42.789 --> 01:04:42.799 align:start position:0%
that again that they're plugged into the
 
01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
community system and an additional
 
01:04:47.589 --> 01:04:47.599 align:start position:0%
feature is that there's Care Management
 
01:04:50.150 --> 01:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
for 30 days after they leave that
 
01:04:53.230 --> 01:04:53.240 align:start position:0%
setting um to be able to make sure that
 
01:04:54.750 --> 01:04:54.760 align:start position:0%
not only were the things set up but
 
01:04:57.910 --> 01:04:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:59.870 --> 01:04:59.880 align:start position:0%
um we've also are working on
 
01:05:02.630 --> 01:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
implementing from the last couple of uh
 
01:05:06.670 --> 01:05:06.680 align:start position:0%
sessions the uh mnus Provisions uh that
 
01:05:09.109 --> 01:05:09.119 align:start position:0%
were the douas and the lactation
 
01:05:11.029 --> 01:05:11.039 align:start position:0%
Consultants we've already implemented
 
01:05:13.390 --> 01:05:13.400 align:start position:0%
donor uh breast milk we having to work
 
01:05:14.670 --> 01:05:14.680 align:start position:0%
with the office of professional
 
01:05:17.589 --> 01:05:17.599 align:start position:0%
licensure on douas and
 
01:05:20.870 --> 01:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
lactation um I'm going to skip the the
 
01:05:24.990 --> 01:05:25.000 align:start position:0%
slides on um enrollment just jump to uh
 
01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.150 align:start position:0%
slides on um enrollment just jump to uh
the

01:05:26.150 --> 01:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:05:27.910 --> 01:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
slide that has the colorful picture of
 
01:05:29.470 --> 01:05:29.480 align:start position:0%
pink and green here I see this page
 
01:05:32.470 --> 01:05:32.480 align:start position:0%
number didn't make it on there um but uh
 
01:05:34.910 --> 01:05:34.920 align:start position:0%
that is what I call our waiver wheel
 
01:05:38.029 --> 01:05:38.039 align:start position:0%
this sort of describes the entire
 
01:05:41.390 --> 01:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program both what we oversee
 
01:05:43.589 --> 01:05:43.599 align:start position:0%
directly within the division but also
 
01:05:45.589 --> 01:05:45.599 align:start position:0%
the other parts of the department
 
01:05:47.710 --> 01:05:47.720 align:start position:0%
whether it be in children's and youth
 
01:05:50.109 --> 01:05:50.119 align:start position:0%
services Behavioral Health what have you
 
01:05:52.829 --> 01:05:52.839 align:start position:0%
adult uh Services long-term services and
 
01:05:54.950 --> 01:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
support but we we sort of work with
 
01:05:56.870 --> 01:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
those divisions and getting these things
 
01:05:59.829 --> 01:05:59.839 align:start position:0%
in place federally so that the services
 
01:06:01.789 --> 01:06:01.799 align:start position:0%
can be claimed for under
 
01:06:05.470 --> 01:06:05.480 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and lastly sometimes we'll
 
01:06:08.510 --> 01:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
we'll talk about um different match
 
01:06:10.910 --> 01:06:10.920 align:start position:0%
rates federally and this is just a table
 
01:06:15.150 --> 01:06:15.160 align:start position:0%
on slide 10 of the different um match
 
01:06:17.029 --> 01:06:17.039 align:start position:0%
rates that we get on different
 
01:06:21.269 --> 01:06:21.279 align:start position:0%
Services um in um again I'll if you have
 
01:06:22.829 --> 01:06:22.839 align:start position:0%
questions on the table be happy to take
 
01:06:25.589 --> 01:06:25.599 align:start position:0%
them either today or any time um
 
01:06:29.430 --> 01:06:29.440 align:start position:0%
Medicaid is a a complex uh program in
 
01:06:31.750 --> 01:06:31.760 align:start position:0%
its details it's simple I think in you
 
01:06:32.990 --> 01:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
know we basically are supposed to
 
01:06:34.549 --> 01:06:34.559 align:start position:0%
provide a health insurance service under
 
01:06:35.829 --> 01:06:35.839 align:start position:0%
the division of Medicaid services
 
01:06:37.829 --> 01:06:37.839 align:start position:0%
through the Managed Care program after
 
01:06:40.109 --> 01:06:40.119 align:start position:0%
that it gets a little deeper and thicker
 
01:06:42.349 --> 01:06:42.359 align:start position:0%
but be happy to at any time either
 
01:06:44.269 --> 01:06:44.279 align:start position:0%
oneon-one or or come to the committee
 
01:06:47.430 --> 01:06:47.440 align:start position:0%
and provide additional
 
01:06:49.990 --> 01:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
information thank you it's my
 
01:06:51.750 --> 01:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
understanding and I think again going
 
01:06:54.190 --> 01:06:54.200 align:start position:0%
back to my years in the department uh
 
01:06:56.029 --> 01:06:56.039 align:start position:0%
Medicaid is roughly 70% % of the
 
01:06:58.029 --> 01:06:58.039 align:start position:0%
Department's budget is that
 
01:07:02.069 --> 01:07:02.079 align:start position:0%
correct um I think that is probably in
 
01:07:04.190 --> 01:07:04.200 align:start position:0%
the neighborhood I know that the
 
01:07:06.789 --> 01:07:06.799 align:start position:0%
Department's about 53% of the state
 
01:07:08.510 --> 01:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
budget and I think we're probably at
 
01:07:12.510 --> 01:07:12.520 align:start position:0%
least 50 60% of the Department's
 
01:07:15.910 --> 01:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
budget I also noticed that um New
 
01:07:17.789 --> 01:07:17.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Medicaid enrollment is fourth
 
01:07:19.470 --> 01:07:19.480 align:start position:0%
smallest in the country is that
 
01:07:21.430 --> 01:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
attributable to the to the unwind effort
 
01:07:24.109 --> 01:07:24.119 align:start position:0%
or no um before the unwind we were
 
01:07:25.710 --> 01:07:25.720 align:start position:0%
fourth smallest during the unwi when
 
01:07:27.109 --> 01:07:27.119 align:start position:0%
we're fourth smallest and today we're
 
01:07:29.710 --> 01:07:29.720 align:start position:0%
the fourth smallest
 
01:07:32.430 --> 01:07:32.440 align:start position:0%
um the difference different states have
 
01:07:35.069 --> 01:07:35.079 align:start position:0%
different Federal match rates for their
 
01:07:37.470 --> 01:07:37.480 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program federally like
 
01:07:39.309 --> 01:07:39.319 align:start position:0%
Mississippi I think their match rate on
 
01:07:40.910 --> 01:07:40.920 align:start position:0%
standard Medicaid is
 
01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:42.430 align:start position:0%
standard Medicaid is
82%

01:07:42.430 --> 01:07:42.440 align:start position:0%
82%
 
01:07:45.710 --> 01:07:45.720 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire's is 50% Massachusetts
 
01:07:48.829 --> 01:07:48.839 align:start position:0%
is 50% both Maine and Vermont have a
 
01:07:50.710 --> 01:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
little higher than New Hampshire and
 
01:07:53.870 --> 01:07:53.880 align:start position:0%
it's based on a federal formula of the
 
01:07:56.750 --> 01:07:56.760 align:start position:0%
economic status of the state as a whole
 
01:07:59.109 --> 01:07:59.119 align:start position:0%
um and while New Hampshire is one of the
 
01:08:01.349 --> 01:08:01.359 align:start position:0%
more affluent States we all know that
 
01:08:02.870 --> 01:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
there are people who are not affluent in
 
01:08:05.109 --> 01:08:05.119 align:start position:0%
the state um just to give you some
 
01:08:07.549 --> 01:08:07.559 align:start position:0%
statistics New Mexico during the
 
01:08:09.589 --> 01:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
pandemic had one in two people in that
 
01:08:12.109 --> 01:08:12.119 align:start position:0%
state enrolled in Medicaid by comparison
 
01:08:13.950 --> 01:08:13.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire was about one and five and
 
01:08:16.229 --> 01:08:16.239 align:start position:0%
a half today we're about one and seven
 
01:08:18.709 --> 01:08:18.719 align:start position:0%
but our neighboring states like Vermont
 
01:08:20.789 --> 01:08:20.799 align:start position:0%
and and Maine are close to one and four
 
01:08:23.630 --> 01:08:23.640 align:start position:0%
one and five um so we have fewer people
 
01:08:25.630 --> 01:08:25.640 align:start position:0%
because of the economic status of the
 
01:08:27.950 --> 01:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
entire population in New Hampshire um
 
01:08:29.470 --> 01:08:29.480 align:start position:0%
which makes us the fourth smallest in
 
01:08:30.990 --> 01:08:31.000 align:start position:0%
the country so that's a good thing I
 
01:08:33.749 --> 01:08:33.759 align:start position:0%
would I would say yes yeah good great um
 
01:08:36.110 --> 01:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
and we also have you know our
 
01:08:39.510 --> 01:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
eligibility criteria are are as as
 
01:08:41.630 --> 01:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
generous or more generous with respect
 
01:08:45.789 --> 01:08:45.799 align:start position:0%
to um uh the various groups that we
 
01:08:49.829 --> 01:08:49.839 align:start position:0%
covered great representative
 
01:08:52.110 --> 01:08:52.120 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:08:53.950 --> 01:08:53.960 align:start position:0%
for being here today I just wanted to
 
01:08:56.030 --> 01:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
comment that uh
 
01:08:59.550 --> 01:08:59.560 align:start position:0%
possibly as a an offshoot of um
 
01:09:02.269 --> 01:09:02.279 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards comments or
 
01:09:05.229 --> 01:09:05.239 align:start position:0%
questions um I have had a number over
 
01:09:07.870 --> 01:09:07.880 align:start position:0%
the years of of constituents who have
 
01:09:09.789 --> 01:09:09.799 align:start position:0%
had truly
 
01:09:14.269 --> 01:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
emergent issues um of supplies they need
 
01:09:18.269 --> 01:09:18.279 align:start position:0%
or care that caregivers that are
 
01:09:21.550 --> 01:09:21.560 align:start position:0%
unavailable that were very desperate and
 
01:09:23.749 --> 01:09:23.759 align:start position:0%
I try not to abuse the privilege but I
 
01:09:25.950 --> 01:09:25.960 align:start position:0%
just want to say that any time I have
 
01:09:28.149 --> 01:09:28.159 align:start position:0%
referred that to you you have
 
01:09:30.910 --> 01:09:30.920 align:start position:0%
immediately found the right person to to
 
01:09:35.630 --> 01:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
set it right and to ensure that that
 
01:09:37.829 --> 01:09:37.839 align:start position:0%
constituent went on getting the services
 
01:09:40.110 --> 01:09:40.120 align:start position:0%
they need and I'm very grateful to you
 
01:09:41.950 --> 01:09:41.960 align:start position:0%
and your department for doing that so I
 
01:09:44.149 --> 01:09:44.159 align:start position:0%
just wanted to note it thank you for for
 
01:09:47.910 --> 01:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
saying so I I would add to that when we
 
01:09:49.590 --> 01:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
were talking earlier about eligibility
 
01:09:51.829 --> 01:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
there when the if you will the managed
 
01:09:53.709 --> 01:09:53.719 align:start position:0%
care system isn't living up to what we
 
01:09:55.390 --> 01:09:55.400 align:start position:0%
need it to do in a particular situation
 
01:09:58.709 --> 01:09:58.719 align:start position:0%
and that's where my Division I I have um
 
01:10:00.510 --> 01:10:00.520 align:start position:0%
two people that are
 
01:10:03.790 --> 01:10:03.800 align:start position:0%
clinicians um who can help sort of size
 
01:10:05.750 --> 01:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
up a situation clinically so I may be
 
01:10:08.270 --> 01:10:08.280 align:start position:0%
working with uh Karen's team on that
 
01:10:10.709 --> 01:10:10.719 align:start position:0%
issue because there may be elements that
 
01:10:14.790 --> 01:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
are not just Financial or or criteria
 
01:10:17.110 --> 01:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
but real medical needs and also Dr
 
01:10:18.510 --> 01:10:18.520 align:start position:0%
ballad who's the medical director for
 
01:10:20.830 --> 01:10:20.840 align:start position:0%
the department and the Medicaid Program
 
01:10:24.110 --> 01:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
have access to to him as well and um you
 
01:10:26.350 --> 01:10:26.360 align:start position:0%
know we try to be helpful there are
 
01:10:28.310 --> 01:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
situations that are very concerning and
 
01:10:31.149 --> 01:10:31.159 align:start position:0%
um at times and we we will jump on them
 
01:10:33.270 --> 01:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
because we need
 
01:10:36.830 --> 01:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
to representative Woods oh thank you uh
 
01:10:40.350 --> 01:10:40.360 align:start position:0%
for Mr chair um um at the risk of
 
01:10:41.870 --> 01:10:41.880 align:start position:0%
jumping down a rabbit hole which I don't
 
01:10:44.590 --> 01:10:44.600 align:start position:0%
want to do but just a very superficial
 
01:10:46.430 --> 01:10:46.440 align:start position:0%
comment do you have difficulties with
 
01:10:49.310 --> 01:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
pbms and your Pharmacy
 
01:10:52.510 --> 01:10:52.520 align:start position:0%
area um I would say that it's very
 
01:10:54.870 --> 01:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
different than what the population at
 
01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:56.030 align:start position:0%
different than what the population at
Large

01:10:56.030 --> 01:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
Large
 
01:11:00.110 --> 01:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
is experiencing because Medicaid um we
 
01:11:03.910 --> 01:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
we have um a different relationship than
 
01:11:06.350 --> 01:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
than the typical Commercial Insurance uh
 
01:11:09.030 --> 01:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
with the pbms each of the mcos have
 
01:11:12.030 --> 01:11:12.040 align:start position:0%
their own PBM but like all these issues
 
01:11:13.910 --> 01:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
around like price transparency and
 
01:11:16.030 --> 01:11:16.040 align:start position:0%
things like that we have th that issue
 
01:11:17.830 --> 01:11:17.840 align:start position:0%
solved within the Medicaid Program we
 
01:11:20.189 --> 01:11:20.199 align:start position:0%
get different discount levels as a
 
01:11:23.030 --> 01:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program um I think one of the
 
01:11:25.590 --> 01:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
things that is happening out there that
 
01:11:27.910 --> 01:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
that is similar to the rest of the
 
01:11:30.430 --> 01:11:30.440 align:start position:0%
healthcare Market if you will is that um
 
01:11:33.270 --> 01:11:33.280 align:start position:0%
narrower networks um Managed Care
 
01:11:35.310 --> 01:11:35.320 align:start position:0%
organizations at one time had
 
01:11:37.070 --> 01:11:37.080 align:start position:0%
relationships with all pharmacies and
 
01:11:38.669 --> 01:11:38.679 align:start position:0%
now for example they may be with
 
01:11:41.709 --> 01:11:41.719 align:start position:0%
Walgreens but not with um right8 or
 
01:11:44.990 --> 01:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
whatever um and so we see that issue
 
01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.470 align:start position:0%
whatever um and so we see that issue
also

01:11:46.470 --> 01:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:11:51.709 --> 01:11:51.719 align:start position:0%
um I think that uh um the the issue of
 
01:11:54.629 --> 01:11:54.639 align:start position:0%
different um Financial factors playing
 
01:11:58.189 --> 01:11:58.199 align:start position:0%
in uh with the transparency that we get
 
01:12:00.270 --> 01:12:00.280 align:start position:0%
um we're not experiencing some of those
 
01:12:03.030 --> 01:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
issues uh I think our our other issue I
 
01:12:05.470 --> 01:12:05.480 align:start position:0%
guess that's common to the rest of it of
 
01:12:07.550 --> 01:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
of the population and maybe somewhat
 
01:12:10.030 --> 01:12:10.040 align:start position:0%
unique is all these Gene therapies for
 
01:12:12.750 --> 01:12:12.760 align:start position:0%
rare diseases that come through and I
 
01:12:14.030 --> 01:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
can tell you
 
01:12:18.070 --> 01:12:18.080 align:start position:0%
that um for example one rare disease uh
 
01:12:20.470 --> 01:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
that uh duchaine distrophy
 
01:12:24.750 --> 01:12:24.760 align:start position:0%
um we've had since since that therapy
 
01:12:28.669 --> 01:12:28.679 align:start position:0%
was a ailable um you know a few
 
01:12:31.149 --> 01:12:31.159 align:start position:0%
instances where we've had to do it but
 
01:12:34.030 --> 01:12:34.040 align:start position:0%
that therapy alone which actually
 
01:12:36.510 --> 01:12:36.520 align:start position:0%
effectively cures Duane
 
01:12:39.110 --> 01:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
distopy um in a way that they child has
 
01:12:42.390 --> 01:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
a normal life costs 2.6
 
01:12:45.550 --> 01:12:45.560 align:start position:0%
million um and so you know when I
 
01:12:47.270 --> 01:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
started the program started working in
 
01:12:48.910 --> 01:12:48.920 align:start position:0%
the program we'd have one or two of
 
01:12:52.030 --> 01:12:52.040 align:start position:0%
these types of therapies come available
 
01:12:55.709 --> 01:12:55.719 align:start position:0%
um each year last year 66 potential
 
01:12:58.510 --> 01:12:58.520 align:start position:0%
therapies of that nature um were
 
01:13:00.470 --> 01:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
available the the velocity of
 
01:13:02.790 --> 01:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
breakthroughs and that the Medicaid
 
01:13:04.430 --> 01:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
Program I think can experience more of
 
01:13:06.310 --> 01:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
that because some of the individuals
 
01:13:08.270 --> 01:13:08.280 align:start position:0%
that end up in Medicaid are because they
 
01:13:12.070 --> 01:13:12.080 align:start position:0%
have rare conditions and so one of the
 
01:13:14.430 --> 01:13:14.440 align:start position:0%
when if you go back to that
 
01:13:18.149 --> 01:13:18.159 align:start position:0%
um page uh five one of the feature new
 
01:13:20.030 --> 01:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
features in the program the second one
 
01:13:23.629 --> 01:13:23.639 align:start position:0%
down was a High Cost Pharmacy risk pool
 
01:13:25.270 --> 01:13:25.280 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the Managed Care
 
01:13:26.870 --> 01:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
companies are better aligned with us in
 
01:13:29.430 --> 01:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
terms of how we use these therapies
 
01:13:31.870 --> 01:13:31.880 align:start position:0%
we've created a shared a greater sharing
 
01:13:34.830 --> 01:13:34.840 align:start position:0%
of risk around those unique therapies um
 
01:13:36.870 --> 01:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
and um you know we just initiated that
 
01:13:39.430 --> 01:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
in September I don't uh but the the goal
 
01:13:40.830 --> 01:13:40.840 align:start position:0%
of it is to make sure we have
 
01:13:43.750 --> 01:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate utilization um that
 
01:13:46.189 --> 01:13:46.199 align:start position:0%
there's um important followup that
 
01:13:48.629 --> 01:13:48.639 align:start position:0%
occurs so that the therapy is selected
 
01:13:50.590 --> 01:13:50.600 align:start position:0%
and used in the right instances and that
 
01:13:52.709 --> 01:13:52.719 align:start position:0%
the the hospitalization and other things
 
01:13:55.510 --> 01:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
that go around these therapies um done
 
01:13:57.750 --> 01:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
well so that the investment that's being
 
01:14:00.550 --> 01:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
made is is realized in a positive way
 
01:14:03.030 --> 01:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
for the patient and the
 
01:14:04.910 --> 01:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
state other
 
01:14:07.510 --> 01:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative
 
01:14:09.430 --> 01:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
mlan thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:14:11.070 --> 01:14:11.080 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so you have a
 
01:14:12.750 --> 01:14:12.760 align:start position:0%
nice chart here on the back about the
 
01:14:14.709 --> 01:14:14.719 align:start position:0%
the federal match rates I would be
 
01:14:16.189 --> 01:14:16.199 align:start position:0%
interested if you could just kind of
 
01:14:19.709 --> 01:14:19.719 align:start position:0%
paint with a broad brush where we are
 
01:14:22.510 --> 01:14:22.520 align:start position:0%
with our reimbursement rates on Medicaid
 
01:14:24.070 --> 01:14:24.080 align:start position:0%
relative to some of our neighboring
 
01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
states you know are we High are we low
 
01:14:28.229 --> 01:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:32.310 --> 01:14:32.320 align:start position:0%
middle thank you for the question um so
 
01:14:35.830 --> 01:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
hb2 2023 um made a significant
 
01:14:40.709 --> 01:14:40.719 align:start position:0%
investment in rates we were very low um
 
01:14:44.709 --> 01:14:44.719 align:start position:0%
but with that uh um legislation I think
 
01:14:48.070 --> 01:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
we were able to get a lot of um our
 
01:14:51.350 --> 01:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
services in the uh Home and Community
 
01:14:53.149 --> 01:14:53.159 align:start position:0%
Based Services and the long-term
 
01:14:56.270 --> 01:14:56.280 align:start position:0%
Services competitive with other states
 
01:14:58.510 --> 01:14:58.520 align:start position:0%
um and U in certain areas where we
 
01:15:00.750 --> 01:15:00.760 align:start position:0%
Benchmark with Medicare I think where we
 
01:15:03.669 --> 01:15:03.679 align:start position:0%
still have room to do better is with
 
01:15:07.350 --> 01:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
with Physicians um and we we there were
 
01:15:09.870 --> 01:15:09.880 align:start position:0%
increases there but um where we're
 
01:15:12.270 --> 01:15:12.280 align:start position:0%
striving to do is to get to at least 80%
 
01:15:16.669 --> 01:15:16.679 align:start position:0%
of Medicare um and in a number of places
 
01:15:19.990 --> 01:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
we've achieved that um as part of the
 
01:15:22.470 --> 01:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
the Met dish Arrangement that governor
 
01:15:26.390 --> 01:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
senu and and commissioner um weer uh
 
01:15:28.390 --> 01:15:28.400 align:start position:0%
worked on last session hospital
 
01:15:30.910 --> 01:15:30.920 align:start position:0%
inpatient rates are now at Medicare type
 
01:15:33.629 --> 01:15:33.639 align:start position:0%
levels um and under the Medicaid Program
 
01:15:35.350 --> 01:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
we're not supposed to be generally
 
01:15:37.669 --> 01:15:37.679 align:start position:0%
reimbursing more than Medicare so that's
 
01:15:39.510 --> 01:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
why we're looking to get to 80 to 100
 
01:15:41.550 --> 01:15:41.560 align:start position:0%
we're most of the way there except in a
 
01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:43.669 align:start position:0%
we're most of the way there except in a
couple

01:15:43.669 --> 01:15:43.679 align:start position:0%
couple
 
01:15:47.110 --> 01:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
areas and is that in line with uh the
 
01:15:49.590 --> 01:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
other states surrounding us pretty much
 
01:15:51.510 --> 01:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
I think in terms of if I look at
 
01:15:54.310 --> 01:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Maine and and Vermont I
 
01:15:55.990 --> 01:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
think we're probably
 
01:15:57.830 --> 01:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
in the middle of all those I would say
 
01:15:59.390 --> 01:15:59.400 align:start position:0%
at this point or or maybe a little bit
 
01:16:00.430 --> 01:16:00.440 align:start position:0%
better than
 
01:16:03.390 --> 01:16:03.400 align:start position:0%
that thank you representative
 
01:16:06.709 --> 01:16:06.719 align:start position:0%
lante thank you I I'm new to this
 
01:16:09.629 --> 01:16:09.639 align:start position:0%
committee and I'd like to get a big
 
01:16:11.910 --> 01:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
picture understanding of Medicaid
 
01:16:14.590 --> 01:16:14.600 align:start position:0%
funding and to understand the waivers
 
01:16:17.629 --> 01:16:17.639 align:start position:0%
are we given an amount of money for
 
01:16:20.669 --> 01:16:20.679 align:start position:0%
medic um I said Medicare but I meant
 
01:16:23.990 --> 01:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
Medicaid that um is intended for the
 
01:16:26.390 --> 01:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
insurance comp component and then we
 
01:16:29.790 --> 01:16:29.800 align:start position:0%
apply with a waiver to direct that into
 
01:16:33.270 --> 01:16:33.280 align:start position:0%
another program instead of leaving it in
 
01:16:35.590 --> 01:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
the insurance component is that how it
 
01:16:38.669 --> 01:16:38.679 align:start position:0%
works um great question but not not
 
01:16:42.550 --> 01:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
quite so um it's a fe federal state
 
01:16:45.950 --> 01:16:45.960 align:start position:0%
partnership um and so if you think of
 
01:16:49.830 --> 01:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
the just a Pure medical insurance um
 
01:16:53.229 --> 01:16:53.239 align:start position:0%
each person like you would in a um
 
01:16:55.709 --> 01:16:55.719 align:start position:0%
private situation has a premium
 
01:16:57.030 --> 01:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
associated with them we call it a
 
01:17:00.709 --> 01:17:00.719 align:start position:0%
capitation amount and based on which uh
 
01:17:02.669 --> 01:17:02.679 align:start position:0%
group they fall on on this chart like if
 
01:17:05.229 --> 01:17:05.239 align:start position:0%
they're expansion population the feds
 
01:17:08.110 --> 01:17:08.120 align:start position:0%
will give us 90% back if they're
 
01:17:09.830 --> 01:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
standard population they'll give only
 
01:17:13.149 --> 01:17:13.159 align:start position:0%
50% back if they're a CH child what we
 
01:17:16.070 --> 01:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
call a chip program where where New
 
01:17:18.310 --> 01:17:18.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire provides a more generous level
 
01:17:20.990 --> 01:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
of Eligibility the match is
 
01:17:23.830 --> 01:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
65% so that that's how
 
01:17:27.870 --> 01:17:27.880 align:start position:0%
the medical insurance Park gets paid for
 
01:17:30.750 --> 01:17:30.760 align:start position:0%
in um if you kind of think about
 
01:17:32.430 --> 01:17:32.440 align:start position:0%
Medicaid historically was just a
 
01:17:34.669 --> 01:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
categorical program meaning like the
 
01:17:37.870 --> 01:17:37.880 align:start position:0%
Aged the blind the disabled um
 
01:17:40.189 --> 01:17:40.199 align:start position:0%
developmentally dis long-term care you
 
01:17:42.590 --> 01:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
had to have a a categorical kind of
 
01:17:45.990 --> 01:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
thing um to to qualify so the waivers
 
01:17:48.590 --> 01:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
are intended to provide extra
 
01:17:50.950 --> 01:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
services and they provided outside the
 
01:17:53.709 --> 01:17:53.719 align:start position:0%
Managed Care Program um like nursing
 
01:17:56.870 --> 01:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
home care as an example um the Home and
 
01:17:58.350 --> 01:17:58.360 align:start position:0%
Community Based Services that are
 
01:18:00.550 --> 01:18:00.560 align:start position:0%
long-term are outside the Managed Care
 
01:18:02.149 --> 01:18:02.159 align:start position:0%
Program we provide home care for
 
01:18:04.910 --> 01:18:04.920 align:start position:0%
short-term acute phases um within the
 
01:18:07.950 --> 01:18:07.960 align:start position:0%
Medicare program again it works with
 
01:18:10.510 --> 01:18:10.520 align:start position:0%
what services are delivered and build
 
01:18:13.030 --> 01:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
for that the state picks up typically
 
01:18:16.310 --> 01:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
their 50% share and the FEDS pick up the
 
01:18:19.830 --> 01:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
other 50% so on a monthly basis or
 
01:18:22.189 --> 01:18:22.199 align:start position:0%
quarterly basis we're accumulating all
 
01:18:24.590 --> 01:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
these bills if you will going back and
 
01:18:27.350 --> 01:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
or capitation payments and there's a
 
01:18:29.350 --> 01:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
special form that we file with the
 
01:18:31.310 --> 01:18:31.320 align:start position:0%
federal government to prove that we've
 
01:18:32.950 --> 01:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
paid this amount of money and then they
 
01:18:35.950 --> 01:18:35.960 align:start position:0%
send us money to match that
 
01:18:39.950 --> 01:18:39.960 align:start position:0%
okay follow up though um yes just one
 
01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
followup so by this chart here on the
 
01:18:46.830 --> 01:18:46.840 align:start position:0%
last page um the granted advantage
 
01:18:48.950 --> 01:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
that's a managed care that's
 
01:18:51.550 --> 01:18:51.560 align:start position:0%
privatized um no it's delivered through
 
01:18:53.790 --> 01:18:53.800 align:start position:0%
our same Managed Care organizations it's
 
01:18:57.510 --> 01:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
just you know Congress federally had uh
 
01:19:00.430 --> 01:19:00.440 align:start position:0%
in in encouraging states to offer it to
 
01:19:02.750 --> 01:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
people who aren't don't fit a category
 
01:19:05.430 --> 01:19:05.440 align:start position:0%
other than poverty um that they could
 
01:19:08.149 --> 01:19:08.159 align:start position:0%
get insurance and obviously it was that
 
01:19:11.470 --> 01:19:11.480 align:start position:0%
program I think 41 States now have
 
01:19:13.950 --> 01:19:13.960 align:start position:0%
adopted it um you know there are you
 
01:19:16.070 --> 01:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
know federally there are discussions
 
01:19:18.430 --> 01:19:18.440 align:start position:0%
about what might happen in the future
 
01:19:20.270 --> 01:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
there but New Hampshire is one of nine
 
01:19:22.350 --> 01:19:22.360 align:start position:0%
states that has a trigger that if the
 
01:19:24.229 --> 01:19:24.239 align:start position:0%
federal match changes that the program
 
01:19:26.709 --> 01:19:26.719 align:start position:0%
would be signed Sunset and we also have
 
01:19:29.629 --> 01:19:29.639 align:start position:0%
that larger um 7-year
 
01:19:32.669 --> 01:19:32.679 align:start position:0%
reauthorization that uh the legislature
 
01:19:34.629 --> 01:19:34.639 align:start position:0%
has moved from two years and two years
 
01:19:38.110 --> 01:19:38.120 align:start position:0%
to five year and now a seven-year um uh
 
01:19:40.110 --> 01:19:40.120 align:start position:0%
uh possibility to operate the program
 
01:19:41.590 --> 01:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
without a
 
01:19:44.790 --> 01:19:44.800 align:start position:0%
reauthorization okay thank
 
01:19:46.070 --> 01:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
representative palazov and then
 
01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:50.110 align:start position:0%
representative palazov and then
representative

01:19:50.110 --> 01:19:50.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:51.870 align:start position:0%
 
Edwards

01:19:51.870 --> 01:19:51.880 align:start position:0%
Edwards
 
01:19:54.430 --> 01:19:54.440 align:start position:0%
microphone uh thank you for taking my
 
01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:55.149 align:start position:0%
microphone uh thank you for taking my
question

01:19:55.149 --> 01:19:55.159 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:20:00.229 --> 01:20:00.239 align:start position:0%
I wonder if uh income cleff is an issue
 
01:20:04.390 --> 01:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
for uh Medicaid and generally do you
 
01:20:08.229 --> 01:20:08.239 align:start position:0%
have any ideas how we can address income
 
01:20:11.870 --> 01:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
Cliff situation when a small increase in
 
01:20:14.870 --> 01:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
income uh can cause a sudden loss of
 
01:20:18.870 --> 01:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
public benefits uh that uh include
 
01:20:21.550 --> 01:20:21.560 align:start position:0%
Medicaid or other benefits from
 
01:20:24.430 --> 01:20:24.440 align:start position:0%
DHHS sure um there are other people can
 
01:20:27.910 --> 01:20:27.920 align:start position:0%
speak and I think um Karen heit's
 
01:20:30.470 --> 01:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
division of Economic Development they've
 
01:20:32.830 --> 01:20:32.840 align:start position:0%
been working with Chris santinello the
 
01:20:34.669 --> 01:20:34.679 align:start position:0%
ass commissioner there on the cliff
 
01:20:36.310 --> 01:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
effect and there've been work that the
 
01:20:38.350 --> 01:20:38.360 align:start position:0%
Department's done I've not been directly
 
01:20:39.910 --> 01:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
involved in that but one of the things
 
01:20:42.830 --> 01:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
we do do in our New Hampshire Medicaid
 
01:20:45.390 --> 01:20:45.400 align:start position:0%
Program is that people who may go over
 
01:20:47.550 --> 01:20:47.560 align:start position:0%
the cliff but who we recognize are
 
01:20:50.189 --> 01:20:50.199 align:start position:0%
eligible for the ACA coverage on the
 
01:20:51.590 --> 01:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
exchange coverage that we do make
 
01:20:55.110 --> 01:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
referrals automatically um for that
 
01:20:56.709 --> 01:20:56.719 align:start position:0%
where people have the opportunity to
 
01:20:59.030 --> 01:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
consider if they qualif qualify or want
 
01:21:01.350 --> 01:21:01.360 align:start position:0%
to uh buy into that
 
01:21:04.709 --> 01:21:04.719 align:start position:0%
program representative Edwards um thank
 
01:21:07.189 --> 01:21:07.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um followup to
 
01:21:11.510 --> 01:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
representative uh L montin I think um it
 
01:21:14.510 --> 01:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
the the Medicaid issue is extremely
 
01:21:17.750 --> 01:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
complex and uh We've not begun to
 
01:21:21.390 --> 01:21:21.400 align:start position:0%
coordinate with Mr Lipman the division 3
 
01:21:23.669 --> 01:21:23.679 align:start position:0%
uh presentation that Medicaid uh
 
01:21:25.350 --> 01:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
delivers to us
 
01:21:27.750 --> 01:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
but um but rather than deal with numbers
 
01:21:30.669 --> 01:21:30.679 align:start position:0%
this time around I really want to teach
 
01:21:33.669 --> 01:21:33.679 align:start position:0%
division 3 as much as we can about the
 
01:21:36.709 --> 01:21:36.719 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program and when we schedule
 
01:21:39.790 --> 01:21:39.800 align:start position:0%
that with you I I'd like to open an
 
01:21:43.390 --> 01:21:43.400 align:start position:0%
invitation to HHS for anyone wants that
 
01:21:45.950 --> 01:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
wants to sit in on that because I I I
 
01:21:48.950 --> 01:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
expect that to be more educational than
 
01:21:52.830 --> 01:21:52.840 align:start position:0%
really Financial um so so that's just
 
01:21:55.910 --> 01:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
one thing and to uh representative U
 
01:21:59.830 --> 01:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
mlan on uh Medicaid reimbursement rates
 
01:22:02.910 --> 01:22:02.920 align:start position:0%
uh division 3 uh looked at this pretty
 
01:22:05.550 --> 01:22:05.560 align:start position:0%
seriously last budget cycle the
 
01:22:07.430 --> 01:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
governor's budget had proposed something
 
01:22:11.030 --> 01:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
like a uh 3% 4% I forget the exact
 
01:22:13.910 --> 01:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
number of a increase to Medicaid
 
01:22:16.510 --> 01:22:16.520 align:start position:0%
reimbursement and uh based on uh
 
01:22:18.990 --> 01:22:19.000 align:start position:0%
testimony we received and looking at the
 
01:22:22.790 --> 01:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
trend we saw from like 2010 to the the
 
01:22:25.790 --> 01:22:25.800 align:start position:0%
current time that we had bled year over
 
01:22:27.950 --> 01:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
year over year falling a little bit
 
01:22:33.270 --> 01:22:33.280 align:start position:0%
further behind in U Medicaid uh equity
 
01:22:37.110 --> 01:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
and and so uh we found the money uh last
 
01:22:41.189 --> 01:22:41.199 align:start position:0%
budget to take another 10% and invested
 
01:22:44.430 --> 01:22:44.440 align:start position:0%
around in the Medicaid services to try
 
01:22:49.310 --> 01:22:49.320 align:start position:0%
to bring them back up to to be less less
 
01:22:53.870 --> 01:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
competitive um this budget cycle I I am
 
01:22:56.149 --> 01:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
having a very hard time imagining a
 
01:22:59.270 --> 01:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
scenario where we're going to be able to
 
01:23:01.550 --> 01:23:01.560 align:start position:0%
to do more than what the governor May
 
01:23:03.590 --> 01:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
propose and we may not be able to even
 
01:23:06.870 --> 01:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
do that so so if that's your issue it's
 
01:23:11.510 --> 01:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:15.189 --> 01:23:15.199 align:start position:0%
budget thank you other questions from Mr
 
01:23:22.070 --> 01:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:01.430 --> 01:24:01.440 align:start position:0%

an opportunity that you can see him um
 
01:25:13.870 --> 01:25:13.880 align:start position:0%
at a future time in terms of a sort of a
 
01:25:15.629 --> 01:25:15.639 align:start position:0%
high level review of New Hampshire
 
01:25:18.870 --> 01:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
hospital we are the state's uh inpatient
 
01:25:22.870 --> 01:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
acute Adult Psychiatric hospital we have
 
01:25:27.350 --> 01:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
a capacity for 185 patients of which is
 
01:25:31.390 --> 01:25:31.400 align:start position:0%
our current capacity um about a year ago
 
01:25:34.510 --> 01:25:34.520 align:start position:0%
at this time our capacity was closer to
 
01:25:37.470 --> 01:25:37.480 align:start position:0%
142 patients thankfully in the last year
 
01:25:39.830 --> 01:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
we've been able to bring on our
 
01:25:41.590 --> 01:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
additional beds to reach our full
 
01:25:44.270 --> 01:25:44.280 align:start position:0%
capacity uh just last month actually in
 
01:25:46.030 --> 01:25:46.040 align:start position:0%
December of
 
01:25:50.189 --> 01:25:50.199 align:start position:0%
2024 um we have nine units they are all
 
01:25:54.310 --> 01:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
approximately uh between 24 and 30ish
 
01:25:56.990 --> 01:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
beds there is some variation there all
 
01:26:00.149 --> 01:26:00.159 align:start position:0%
of them serve uh similar populations in
 
01:26:03.470 --> 01:26:03.480 align:start position:0%
terms of serving the the most acutely
 
01:26:06.350 --> 01:26:06.360 align:start position:0%
mentally ill individuals in the state we
 
01:26:09.070 --> 01:26:09.080 align:start position:0%
do partner with uh what are called other
 
01:26:12.310 --> 01:26:12.320 align:start position:0%
designated receiving facilities or drfs
 
01:26:14.550 --> 01:26:14.560 align:start position:0%
in the state those tend to have a
 
01:26:18.870 --> 01:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
capacity of between 10 and upwards of uh
 
01:26:22.550 --> 01:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
14 to 16 beds those are more community-
 
01:26:24.910 --> 01:26:24.920 align:start position:0%
based of which uh they go through a
 
01:26:27.590 --> 01:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
certification process under
 
01:26:31.510 --> 01:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
DHHS uh to re achieve that drf
 
01:26:33.990 --> 01:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
designation and we partner with them to
 
01:26:37.270 --> 01:26:37.280 align:start position:0%
try to ensure that the patients who uh
 
01:26:39.790 --> 01:26:39.800 align:start position:0%
come to us for admission go to the
 
01:26:41.790 --> 01:26:41.800 align:start position:0%
location that is most appropriate to
 
01:26:44.310 --> 01:26:44.320 align:start position:0%
provide their care which would then
 
01:26:46.669 --> 01:26:46.679 align:start position:0%
allow New Hampshire hospital to serve uh
 
01:26:49.910 --> 01:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
the most acute individuals in the state
 
01:26:52.390 --> 01:26:52.400 align:start position:0%
um in the past year we've also been an
 
01:26:54.629 --> 01:26:54.639 align:start position:0%
integral part you you may be aware of or
 
01:26:57.350 --> 01:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
heard of mission zero um and Care
 
01:27:00.229 --> 01:27:00.239 align:start position:0%
traffic control uh Mission zero is the
 
01:27:02.709 --> 01:27:02.719 align:start position:0%
Department's efforts to eliminate Ed
 
01:27:05.750 --> 01:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
boarding of individuals who are awaiting
 
01:27:08.070 --> 01:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
uh our level of care in the state of New
 
01:27:11.149 --> 01:27:11.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I am um proud to say that on
 
01:27:14.109 --> 01:27:14.119 align:start position:0%
four occasions recently we have achieved
 
01:27:16.990 --> 01:27:17.000 align:start position:0%
a Quee of zero adults waiting in the
 
01:27:20.229 --> 01:27:20.239 align:start position:0%
state um those have been through very
 
01:27:22.709 --> 01:27:22.719 align:start position:0%
collaborative efforts of multiple
 
01:27:24.950 --> 01:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
stakeholders um and many different areas
 
01:27:27.229 --> 01:27:27.239 align:start position:0%
of the state but I mentioned care
 
01:27:30.830 --> 01:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
traffic control uh CTC uh has really
 
01:27:33.790 --> 01:27:33.800 align:start position:0%
been a driving force in being able to
 
01:27:36.870 --> 01:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
make those accomplishments and minimize
 
01:27:39.109 --> 01:27:39.119 align:start position:0%
some of the weight time that has uh
 
01:27:40.669 --> 01:27:40.679 align:start position:0%
previously been the case for these
 
01:27:43.629 --> 01:27:43.639 align:start position:0%
individuals CTC is part of our
 
01:27:45.189 --> 01:27:45.199 align:start position:0%
admissions department at New Hampshire
 
01:27:47.830 --> 01:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
hospital and in the past year they have
 
01:27:50.669 --> 01:27:50.679 align:start position:0%
become really the central intake of all
 
01:27:53.750 --> 01:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
of the Ia or involuntary emergency
 
01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:55.149 align:start position:0%
of the Ia or involuntary emergency
admissions

01:27:55.149 --> 01:27:55.159 align:start position:0%
admissions
 
01:27:57.750 --> 01:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh orders throughout the state before
 
01:28:01.430 --> 01:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
that it was parsed out to um basically
 
01:28:04.109 --> 01:28:04.119 align:start position:0%
every single drf to kind of handle
 
01:28:07.550 --> 01:28:07.560 align:start position:0%
independently um today actually the 16th
 
01:28:09.990 --> 01:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
is the one-year anniversary of standing
 
01:28:13.109 --> 01:28:13.119 align:start position:0%
up the care Traffic Control Department
 
01:28:14.830 --> 01:28:14.840 align:start position:0%
um we are really proud of all the work
 
01:28:16.669 --> 01:28:16.679 align:start position:0%
that they have been able to accomplish
 
01:28:19.350 --> 01:28:19.360 align:start position:0%
and and celebrated them a bit today um
 
01:28:21.270 --> 01:28:21.280 align:start position:0%
I'll hand it over unless there's
 
01:28:22.750 --> 01:28:22.760 align:start position:0%
questions for me which I'm happy to
 
01:28:25.270 --> 01:28:25.280 align:start position:0%
address uh to Cindy B bonus who will
 
01:28:27.149 --> 01:28:27.159 align:start position:0%
share just a bit more
 
01:28:30.470 --> 01:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
information M representative Weber I
 
01:28:33.109 --> 01:28:33.119 align:start position:0%
just wonder if you would uh touch very
 
01:28:36.870 --> 01:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
briefly on one of the things we have
 
01:28:38.950 --> 01:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
heard a lot about in the past is not
 
01:28:41.870 --> 01:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
only the issue of admissions but the
 
01:28:44.430 --> 01:28:44.440 align:start position:0%
issue of timely discharge and I'd love
 
01:28:46.390 --> 01:28:46.400 align:start position:0%
to hear just a little bit from one of
 
01:28:48.310 --> 01:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
you about where you are with that
 
01:28:50.430 --> 01:28:50.440 align:start position:0%
particular part of the puzzle thank you
 
01:28:53.270 --> 01:28:53.280 align:start position:0%
representative that is a a wonderful
 
01:28:54.910 --> 01:28:54.920 align:start position:0%
question and exactly the direction that
 
01:28:56.870 --> 01:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
Cindy was going to go okay thank you
 
01:28:59.310 --> 01:28:59.320 align:start position:0%
representative McKay had a question also
 
01:29:03.750 --> 01:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
is that for M La point or it's it it's
 
01:29:08.270 --> 01:29:08.280 align:start position:0%
connected I think uh to uh the question
 
01:29:11.790 --> 01:29:11.800 align:start position:0%
you already have and that is about the
 
01:29:14.350 --> 01:29:14.360 align:start position:0%
borders uh which
 
01:29:17.550 --> 01:29:17.560 align:start position:0%
means that people get to New Hampshire
 
01:29:20.189 --> 01:29:20.199 align:start position:0%
hospital through their local
 
01:29:23.550 --> 01:29:23.560 align:start position:0%
hospital uh because of the lack of bed
 
01:29:23.560 --> 01:29:25.510 align:start position:0%
hospital uh because of the lack of bed
capacity

01:29:25.510 --> 01:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
capacity
 
01:29:31.870 --> 01:29:31.880 align:start position:0%
those people are put into essentially a
 
01:29:34.669 --> 01:29:34.679 align:start position:0%
room uh maybe a
 
01:29:39.950 --> 01:29:39.960 align:start position:0%
TV uh there's no treatment for them and
 
01:29:41.709 --> 01:29:41.719 align:start position:0%
sometimes they had been
 
01:29:45.229 --> 01:29:45.239 align:start position:0%
staying uh in that hospital for days at
 
01:29:50.669 --> 01:29:50.679 align:start position:0%
a time uh I understand that this has
 
01:29:53.790 --> 01:29:53.800 align:start position:0%
changed and uh I would like everybody
 
01:29:56.870 --> 01:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
here here to know that there has been
 
01:29:56.880 --> 01:29:58.550 align:start position:0%
here here to know that there has been
very

01:29:58.550 --> 01:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
very
 
01:30:02.669 --> 01:30:02.679 align:start position:0%
negative um uh attitude about the
 
01:30:05.350 --> 01:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
hospital because of that it's not your
 
01:30:09.149 --> 01:30:09.159 align:start position:0%
fault and I know that uh but I I've been
 
01:30:13.189 --> 01:30:13.199 align:start position:0%
curious as to what you've done to I
 
01:30:17.189 --> 01:30:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:20.030 --> 01:30:20.040 align:start position:0%
problem so thank you representative
 
01:30:24.149 --> 01:30:24.159 align:start position:0%
McKay and representative Weber um to
 
01:30:27.350 --> 01:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
questions um we haven't quite gotten to
 
01:30:30.790 --> 01:30:30.800 align:start position:0%
zero consistently in the queue and that
 
01:30:33.990 --> 01:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
is directly related to how our beds are
 
01:30:35.709 --> 01:30:35.719 align:start position:0%
currently utilized and so at New
 
01:30:38.590 --> 01:30:38.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital um we do have quite a
 
01:30:40.790 --> 01:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
few patients a percentage of our census
 
01:30:42.669 --> 01:30:42.679 align:start position:0%
that are patients that are stable for
 
01:30:46.229 --> 01:30:46.239 align:start position:0%
discharge and they more than 15 days
 
01:30:47.629 --> 01:30:47.639 align:start position:0%
sometimes for months before we can
 
01:30:51.030 --> 01:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
discharge them and that is related to um
 
01:30:53.510 --> 01:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
resource shortages in the community at
 
01:30:56.830 --> 01:30:56.840 align:start position:0%
lower levels of care and so to that end
 
01:30:59.149 --> 01:30:59.159 align:start position:0%
one of the initiatives of mission zero
 
01:31:01.510 --> 01:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
does include looking at the back door at
 
01:31:04.550 --> 01:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospital um and reviewing
 
01:31:06.709 --> 01:31:06.719 align:start position:0%
that population in collaboration with
 
01:31:07.990 --> 01:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
the Community Mental Health Center
 
01:31:10.070 --> 01:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
system and the division of Behavioral
 
01:31:12.430 --> 01:31:12.440 align:start position:0%
Health and Nami um we have a work group
 
01:31:15.109 --> 01:31:15.119 align:start position:0%
that is scheduled for um our first
 
01:31:19.430 --> 01:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
meeting on January 30th to address those
 
01:31:22.830 --> 01:31:22.840 align:start position:0%
issues to talk about what are the
 
01:31:25.189 --> 01:31:25.199 align:start position:0%
systemwide res resources required in
 
01:31:27.189 --> 01:31:27.199 align:start position:0%
order to bring these people out of the
 
01:31:30.229 --> 01:31:30.239 align:start position:0%
hospital into the community um and even
 
01:31:31.910 --> 01:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
process efficiencies that we can
 
01:31:35.270 --> 01:31:35.280 align:start position:0%
Implement in order to um expedite
 
01:31:38.590 --> 01:31:38.600 align:start position:0%
discharge planning and help our
 
01:31:40.990 --> 01:31:41.000 align:start position:0%
patients be discharge from the hospital
 
01:31:44.390 --> 01:31:44.400 align:start position:0%
as soon as they're clinically ready to
 
01:31:47.430 --> 01:31:47.440 align:start position:0%
go other
 
01:31:51.350 --> 01:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
questions seeing done oh Representative
 
01:31:54.870 --> 01:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
grath no okay any other
 
01:32:09.669 --> 01:32:09.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:28.590 --> 01:32:28.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:31.270 --> 01:32:31.280 align:start position:0%
good to see you again Miss tth T it's
 
01:32:32.709 --> 01:32:32.719 align:start position:0%
been a few
 
01:32:36.910 --> 01:32:36.920 align:start position:0%
years h no no now now it's on good
 
01:32:39.510 --> 01:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
afternoon uh it's very nice to be here
 
01:32:41.270 --> 01:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
my name is Meredith tus I'm the director
 
01:32:42.790 --> 01:32:42.800 align:start position:0%
of the division of program quality and
 
01:32:44.350 --> 01:32:44.360 align:start position:0%
integrity for the Department of Health
 
01:32:47.070 --> 01:32:47.080 align:start position:0%
and Human Services and I am joined by
 
01:32:49.270 --> 01:32:49.280 align:start position:0%
the director of our Bureau of program
 
01:32:51.510 --> 01:32:51.520 align:start position:0%
quality Susan drown and our director of
 
01:32:52.950 --> 01:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
our Bureau of program Integrity Tasha
 
01:32:55.830 --> 01:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
Blanchard um not here today is the head
 
01:32:57.870 --> 01:32:57.880 align:start position:0%
of our office of internal audit Teresa
 
01:32:59.629 --> 01:32:59.639 align:start position:0%
Nero but I'll describe some of the
 
01:33:02.390 --> 01:33:02.400 align:start position:0%
functions that she performs for our for
 
01:33:05.149 --> 01:33:05.159 align:start position:0%
our division uh so our division is
 
01:33:06.750 --> 01:33:06.760 align:start position:0%
getting somewhat tenured at this point
 
01:33:09.270 --> 01:33:09.280 align:start position:0%
we're about four years old and we were
 
01:33:11.149 --> 01:33:11.159 align:start position:0%
created in order to many of the
 
01:33:12.990 --> 01:33:13.000 align:start position:0%
functions within the division already
 
01:33:15.390 --> 01:33:15.400 align:start position:0%
existed but we were created in order to
 
01:33:17.470 --> 01:33:17.480 align:start position:0%
bring those together Under One Roof so
 
01:33:18.790 --> 01:33:18.800 align:start position:0%
that we could coordinate amongst each
 
01:33:21.510 --> 01:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
other all of the support that we offer
 
01:33:23.870 --> 01:33:23.880 align:start position:0%
across the department and strengthen
 
01:33:25.470 --> 01:33:25.480 align:start position:0%
some of the support that we offer across
 
01:33:27.750 --> 01:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
the department we are really a support
 
01:33:30.310 --> 01:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
entity we support all of the other
 
01:33:32.390 --> 01:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
programs within the department in one
 
01:33:34.430 --> 01:33:34.440 align:start position:0%
way or another so originally it was
 
01:33:36.870 --> 01:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
largely focused on Medicaid doing a lot
 
01:33:39.149 --> 01:33:39.159 align:start position:0%
of quality work in quality metrics and
 
01:33:42.109 --> 01:33:42.119 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program integrity and also snap
 
01:33:45.910 --> 01:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
for um our our SNAP program a lot of
 
01:33:47.870 --> 01:33:47.880 align:start position:0%
support there but we've expanded over
 
01:33:49.470 --> 01:33:49.480 align:start position:0%
the years so that we support programs
 
01:33:51.750 --> 01:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
across the department both in in things
 
01:33:53.870 --> 01:33:53.880 align:start position:0%
like data data analytics quality
 
01:33:55.910 --> 01:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
performance metrics and also in
 
01:33:58.550 --> 01:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
Integrity functions uh like audits
 
01:34:00.830 --> 01:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
internal Audits and and external Audits
 
01:34:03.629 --> 01:34:03.639 align:start position:0%
and reviews so that's a a high level
 
01:34:05.830 --> 01:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
overview and then I'll ask uh Susan to
 
01:34:07.270 --> 01:34:07.280 align:start position:0%
describe a little bit more detail in
 
01:34:09.109 --> 01:34:09.119 align:start position:0%
what happens in the Bureau of program
 
01:34:12.470 --> 01:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
quality sure good afternoon Susan drown
 
01:34:13.750 --> 01:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
I'm the director of the Bureau of
 
01:34:16.149 --> 01:34:16.159 align:start position:0%
program quality and it's our bureau's
 
01:34:18.709 --> 01:34:18.719 align:start position:0%
mission to provide data driven support
 
01:34:21.270 --> 01:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
across the entire department um and
 
01:34:23.030 --> 01:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
that's with the aim of informing
 
01:34:25.550 --> 01:34:25.560 align:start position:0%
decision and policym as well as
 
01:34:27.350 --> 01:34:27.360 align:start position:0%
providing support with quality
 
01:34:29.830 --> 01:34:29.840 align:start position:0%
management and performance Improvement
 
01:34:32.750 --> 01:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
activities so we do that by leveraging
 
01:34:34.950 --> 01:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
the skills of our staff across five work
 
01:34:38.350 --> 01:34:38.360 align:start position:0%
units we have health services assessment
 
01:34:40.709 --> 01:34:40.719 align:start position:0%
contract quality management data
 
01:34:43.470 --> 01:34:43.480 align:start position:0%
analytics and Reporting Medicaid quality
 
01:34:45.590 --> 01:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
program and then substance misuse
 
01:34:48.109 --> 01:34:48.119 align:start position:0%
prevention and evaluation and just
 
01:34:50.790 --> 01:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
briefly two of the primary um activities
 
01:34:54.070 --> 01:34:54.080 align:start position:0%
that we do is for Medicaid Care
 
01:34:56.629 --> 01:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
Management data we do data collection
 
01:34:58.990 --> 01:34:59.000 align:start position:0%
and reporting to ensure that our New
 
01:35:00.709 --> 01:35:00.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens who are receiving
 
01:35:03.709 --> 01:35:03.719 align:start position:0%
Medicaid are have access to quality
 
01:35:06.149 --> 01:35:06.159 align:start position:0%
services and then we also work across
 
01:35:08.229 --> 01:35:08.239 align:start position:0%
the department to provide standardized
 
01:35:10.750 --> 01:35:10.760 align:start position:0%
methods of contract quality management
 
01:35:13.189 --> 01:35:13.199 align:start position:0%
um with regards to active contract
 
01:35:15.910 --> 01:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
management and through that we also look
 
01:35:20.590 --> 01:35:20.600 align:start position:0%
at um performance metrics uh those areas
 
01:35:22.470 --> 01:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
that we have contracted for that are
 
01:35:24.950 --> 01:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
desired outcomes and the standards and
 
01:35:27.149 --> 01:35:27.159 align:start position:0%
for those areas that fall below that we
 
01:35:30.390 --> 01:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
help develop quality improvement plans
 
01:35:38.149 --> 01:35:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:41.310 --> 01:35:41.320 align:start position:0%
standards hi my name is Tasha Blanchard
 
01:35:43.030 --> 01:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
and I'm as Merida said I'm the director
 
01:35:44.310 --> 01:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
of the program could you speak up a
 
01:35:44.320 --> 01:35:47.030 align:start position:0%
of the program could you speak up a
little

01:35:47.030 --> 01:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:50.510 --> 01:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
more um I'm the director for the program
 
01:35:53.629 --> 01:35:53.639 align:start position:0%
integrity and there are six units on
 
01:35:55.750 --> 01:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
under the program Integrity but all of
 
01:35:59.990 --> 01:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
the units do reviews and
 
01:36:02.030 --> 01:36:02.040 align:start position:0%
investigations under the different
 
01:36:03.310 --> 01:36:03.320 align:start position:0%
programs within
 
01:36:06.189 --> 01:36:06.199 align:start position:0%
DHHS we also are considered subject
 
01:36:08.910 --> 01:36:08.920 align:start position:0%
matter experts in as far as compliance
 
01:36:11.470 --> 01:36:11.480 align:start position:0%
goes and Regulatory and we assist many
 
01:36:13.189 --> 01:36:13.199 align:start position:0%
of the program areas when they're
 
01:36:16.550 --> 01:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
developing their new programs their new
 
01:36:19.390 --> 01:36:19.400 align:start position:0%
um rules or whatever to ensure that
 
01:36:22.750 --> 01:36:22.760 align:start position:0%
there is compliance in those programs
 
01:36:26.709 --> 01:36:26.719 align:start position:0%
and benchmark Mar s that are manageable
 
01:36:30.310 --> 01:36:30.320 align:start position:0%
and accountable we also assist with many
 
01:36:32.750 --> 01:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
of the programs in any kind of Financial
 
01:36:35.070 --> 01:36:35.080 align:start position:0%
reviews they may have of their vendors
 
01:36:39.750 --> 01:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
their providers and contractors so um we
 
01:36:41.990 --> 01:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
make and we also make sure that the
 
01:36:44.310 --> 01:36:44.320 align:start position:0%
programs are doing what they're required
 
01:36:46.550 --> 01:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
we manage a lot of the federal audits
 
01:36:49.470 --> 01:36:49.480 align:start position:0%
that come in and we we work very hard to
 
01:36:52.430 --> 01:36:52.440 align:start position:0%
make sure that ghhs addresses corrective
 
01:36:54.709 --> 01:36:54.719 align:start position:0%
action plans and that we fix the
 
01:36:56.910 --> 01:36:56.920 align:start position:0%
problems that are found in any of those
 
01:36:59.390 --> 01:36:59.400 align:start position:0%
Audits and we've done a very good job in
 
01:37:01.470 --> 01:37:01.480 align:start position:0%
that that we've reduced the single audit
 
01:37:05.310 --> 01:37:05.320 align:start position:0%
findings from about 14 down to four and
 
01:37:07.350 --> 01:37:07.360 align:start position:0%
so we're very proud of that effort that
 
01:37:10.070 --> 01:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
we've put into that is the investigation
 
01:37:13.590 --> 01:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
junit still under you yes it is and we
 
01:37:17.030 --> 01:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
um we are under the 10% backlog as of
 
01:37:19.109 --> 01:37:19.119 align:start position:0%
last month wow how did you ever do that
 
01:37:23.030 --> 01:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of hard work sure I have no doubt
 
01:37:25.390 --> 01:37:25.400 align:start position:0%
we have incredible uh leader in that
 
01:37:27.910 --> 01:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
unit now uh Lindsay bibo and her she and
 
01:37:30.990 --> 01:37:31.000 align:start position:0%
her staff believed that they could do it
 
01:37:35.030 --> 01:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
and we didn't voice any disbelief and
 
01:37:36.629 --> 01:37:36.639 align:start position:0%
they did it it was it was really a
 
01:37:38.149 --> 01:37:38.159 align:start position:0%
remarkable achievement how many
 
01:37:39.750 --> 01:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
investigators out there now I think we
 
01:37:42.709 --> 01:37:42.719 align:start position:0%
have seven now and two and and two
 
01:37:46.350 --> 01:37:46.360 align:start position:0%
claims and two claims okay yeah right
 
01:37:47.870 --> 01:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
that's right uh so the office of
 
01:37:50.709 --> 01:37:50.719 align:start position:0%
internal audit um is headed up by Teresa
 
01:37:52.870 --> 01:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
Nero who couldn't be here this afternoon
 
01:37:55.990 --> 01:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
um but do a lot of uh internal it's
 
01:37:59.109 --> 01:37:59.119 align:start position:0%
internal reviews exclusively so um Can
 
01:38:02.510 --> 01:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
internally look for management at um you
 
01:38:05.030 --> 01:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
know issues of compliance or efficiency
 
01:38:06.109 --> 01:38:06.119 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness whatever kind of
 
01:38:09.990 --> 01:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
management review needs to be done um if
 
01:38:13.470 --> 01:38:13.480 align:start position:0%
there are um they take in referrals for
 
01:38:15.910 --> 01:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
fraudulent and unethical conduct across
 
01:38:17.510 --> 01:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
the Department per our fraudulent and
 
01:38:19.310 --> 01:38:19.320 align:start position:0%
unethical conduct policy um they would
 
01:38:20.830 --> 01:38:20.840 align:start position:0%
do an investigation that's not Personnel
 
01:38:22.390 --> 01:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
investigation they would just do an
 
01:38:24.310 --> 01:38:24.320 align:start position:0%
investigation for that fraudulent or
 
01:38:29.390 --> 01:38:29.400 align:start position:0%
unethical behavior um they also work to
 
01:38:31.669 --> 01:38:31.679 align:start position:0%
beef up internal controls across the
 
01:38:33.430 --> 01:38:33.440 align:start position:0%
department that includes policies
 
01:38:36.030 --> 01:38:36.040 align:start position:0%
procedures Communications training um
 
01:38:37.910 --> 01:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
all that kind of stuff but it's really
 
01:38:40.430 --> 01:38:40.440 align:start position:0%
internally focused so so you might think
 
01:38:42.189 --> 01:38:42.199 align:start position:0%
of like an ombudsman's office they do
 
01:38:43.629 --> 01:38:43.639 align:start position:0%
things with external stakeholders and
 
01:38:44.750 --> 01:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
they can do reviews from external
 
01:38:47.470 --> 01:38:47.480 align:start position:0%
stakeholders this is just internally
 
01:38:51.109 --> 01:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
focused okay thank you any questions
 
01:38:54.109 --> 01:38:54.119 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards
 
01:38:56.750 --> 01:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um just tell us I
 
01:38:58.790 --> 01:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
think it's it's a little over four years
 
01:39:00.870 --> 01:39:00.880 align:start position:0%
now since I think we first started
 
01:39:03.350 --> 01:39:03.360 align:start position:0%
talking and I've been treed by your
 
01:39:06.390 --> 01:39:06.400 align:start position:0%
program from the very first uh
 
01:39:10.629 --> 01:39:10.639 align:start position:0%
presentation I think we talked about um
 
01:39:14.390 --> 01:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
the um um the capability and limits in
 
01:39:17.189 --> 01:39:17.199 align:start position:0%
your capability of your office and as I
 
01:39:20.070 --> 01:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
remember them briefly it was that you
 
01:39:23.109 --> 01:39:23.119 align:start position:0%
are focused as you must be at coming up
 
01:39:25.990 --> 01:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
with benchmarks and quality measures for
 
01:39:30.390 --> 01:39:30.400 align:start position:0%
our contracts but at the time you had
 
01:39:33.510 --> 01:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
not had the capacity to take a look at
 
01:39:36.149 --> 01:39:36.159 align:start position:0%
uh departmental internal
 
01:39:39.350 --> 01:39:39.360 align:start position:0%
benchmarks uh and so we had a discussion
 
01:39:41.430 --> 01:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
about it and I think please come up with
 
01:39:44.350 --> 01:39:44.360 align:start position:0%
a 10-year plan so that we can have
 
01:39:46.589 --> 01:39:46.599 align:start position:0%
benchmarks for all our departments you
 
01:39:48.390 --> 01:39:48.400 align:start position:0%
know if you can't measure it you can't
 
01:39:51.149 --> 01:39:51.159 align:start position:0%
assure that you're doing it right right
 
01:39:54.270 --> 01:39:54.280 align:start position:0%
and so um so that was four years go I'm
 
01:39:56.070 --> 01:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
just wondering if you remember and if
 
01:39:59.189 --> 01:39:59.199 align:start position:0%
you could give us an update on where you
 
01:40:03.790 --> 01:40:03.800 align:start position:0%
guys are at having bench marks for our
 
01:40:07.589 --> 01:40:07.599 align:start position:0%
departments so sorry I have a large
 
01:40:09.270 --> 01:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
light in the way when I'm trying to see
 
01:40:11.109 --> 01:40:11.119 align:start position:0%
you um but I also want to use the
 
01:40:13.109 --> 01:40:13.119 align:start position:0%
microphone so everyone can hear so a
 
01:40:17.350 --> 01:40:17.360 align:start position:0%
couple things one um yes so the contract
 
01:40:20.310 --> 01:40:20.320 align:start position:0%
quality management unit which was
 
01:40:22.189 --> 01:40:22.199 align:start position:0%
probably non-existent the first time we
 
01:40:24.310 --> 01:40:24.320 align:start position:0%
had that conversation is now up and
 
01:40:25.870 --> 01:40:25.880 align:start position:0%
running and actually staffed with three
 
01:40:27.589 --> 01:40:27.599 align:start position:0%
individuals so they are working across
 
01:40:29.430 --> 01:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
the department with program areas to
 
01:40:31.510 --> 01:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
really beef up the way we write our
 
01:40:32.950 --> 01:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
contracts and the the way we think about
 
01:40:34.109 --> 01:40:34.119 align:start position:0%
our contracts the way we write our
 
01:40:35.510 --> 01:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
contracts and then the way we manage our
 
01:40:37.189 --> 01:40:37.199 align:start position:0%
contracts so that we can consider those
 
01:40:40.070 --> 01:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
kinds of performance metrics which
 
01:40:42.109 --> 01:40:42.119 align:start position:0%
really though they exist in a contract
 
01:40:44.709 --> 01:40:44.719 align:start position:0%
they are our program intended
 
01:40:46.070 --> 01:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
performance metrics right they're the
 
01:40:48.510 --> 01:40:48.520 align:start position:0%
deliverables we need as a department in
 
01:40:50.109 --> 01:40:50.119 align:start position:0%
order to be sure we're accomplishing our
 
01:40:52.870 --> 01:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
strategic goals um so that is that is up
 
01:40:54.430 --> 01:40:54.440 align:start position:0%
and run and they're starting to work
 
01:40:56.030 --> 01:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
with various program areas across the
 
01:40:58.030 --> 01:40:58.040 align:start position:0%
department um and create all kinds of
 
01:40:59.310 --> 01:40:59.320 align:start position:0%
templates and tools that can be
 
01:41:01.270 --> 01:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
leveraged even when they don't have the
 
01:41:03.470 --> 01:41:03.480 align:start position:0%
capacity to work directly with with
 
01:41:03.480 --> 01:41:05.149 align:start position:0%
capacity to work directly with with
someone

01:41:05.149 --> 01:41:05.159 align:start position:0%
someone
 
01:41:08.470 --> 01:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
um as far as more department-wide you
 
01:41:09.990 --> 01:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
know programmatic goals I think one
 
01:41:11.830 --> 01:41:11.840 align:start position:0%
thing you and I talked about was kind of
 
01:41:14.390 --> 01:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
inputs in and then outputs that you get
 
01:41:16.550 --> 01:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
from that and that from a department
 
01:41:19.070 --> 01:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
perspective is extraordinarily difficult
 
01:41:22.270 --> 01:41:22.280 align:start position:0%
because as we discussed we have hundreds
 
01:41:24.550 --> 01:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
of pieces of leg legislation that impact
 
01:41:27.709 --> 01:41:27.719 align:start position:0%
US every year and those require all of
 
01:41:30.030 --> 01:41:30.040 align:start position:0%
our inputs that are doing other things
 
01:41:33.229 --> 01:41:33.239 align:start position:0%
to incorporate then these new uh these
 
01:41:36.030 --> 01:41:36.040 align:start position:0%
new goals and and things that we have to
 
01:41:38.270 --> 01:41:38.280 align:start position:0%
accomplish and so then the things that
 
01:41:40.229 --> 01:41:40.239 align:start position:0%
you were measuring are either no longer
 
01:41:41.510 --> 01:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
being measured or you need to measure a
 
01:41:42.790 --> 01:41:42.800 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of new things because things
 
01:41:46.430 --> 01:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
change so so rapidly so um the the
 
01:41:48.629 --> 01:41:48.639 align:start position:0%
metrics that we have prioritized are the
 
01:41:50.870 --> 01:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
ones in the commissioner's road map and
 
01:41:53.350 --> 01:41:53.360 align:start position:0%
those metrics include a few different
 
01:41:55.149 --> 01:41:55.159 align:start position:0%
areas and that way we can link them with
 
01:41:58.030 --> 01:41:58.040 align:start position:0%
our strategic goals our our budgetary
 
01:41:59.910 --> 01:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
inputs and where we're trying to get
 
01:42:01.790 --> 01:42:01.800 align:start position:0%
between us and our contractors at the
 
01:42:03.990 --> 01:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
same time and so those are split into
 
01:42:06.149 --> 01:42:06.159 align:start position:0%
three different areas um we've got kind
 
01:42:08.229 --> 01:42:08.239 align:start position:0%
of internally focused things uh
 
01:42:10.149 --> 01:42:10.159 align:start position:0%
investing in people and culture we've
 
01:42:13.830 --> 01:42:13.840 align:start position:0%
got um our Our Community Focus so that's
 
01:42:15.390 --> 01:42:15.400 align:start position:0%
where the contracts come in in terms of
 
01:42:17.950 --> 01:42:17.960 align:start position:0%
programmatic outcomes and then we've got
 
01:42:19.669 --> 01:42:19.679 align:start position:0%
uh improving customer service is the
 
01:42:21.310 --> 01:42:21.320 align:start position:0%
Third Leg of that road map and that's
 
01:42:23.669 --> 01:42:23.679 align:start position:0%
improving things like um
 
01:42:26.310 --> 01:42:26.320 align:start position:0%
like our like our Contracting process so
 
01:42:27.950 --> 01:42:27.960 align:start position:0%
that the people we are Contracting with
 
01:42:29.669 --> 01:42:29.679 align:start position:0%
can see those improvements so there's
 
01:42:32.470 --> 01:42:32.480 align:start position:0%
there's sort of functional goals in
 
01:42:34.870 --> 01:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
there and then there's also uh uh
 
01:42:37.229 --> 01:42:37.239 align:start position:0%
programmatic strategy goals in in
 
01:42:38.669 --> 01:42:38.679 align:start position:0%
including like improving the health of
 
01:42:40.550 --> 01:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
women and children that are in there and
 
01:42:42.870 --> 01:42:42.880 align:start position:0%
those have specific targets and
 
01:42:44.910 --> 01:42:44.920 align:start position:0%
deliverables in that road map that are
 
01:42:47.430 --> 01:42:47.440 align:start position:0%
that are attached to numbers specific
 
01:42:47.440 --> 01:42:49.149 align:start position:0%
that are attached to numbers specific
numbers

01:42:49.149 --> 01:42:49.159 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
01:42:49.159 --> 01:42:51.950 align:start position:0%
numbers
y

01:42:51.950 --> 01:42:51.960 align:start position:0%
y
 
01:42:54.910 --> 01:42:54.920 align:start position:0%
followup all I i' I've always been
 
01:42:56.550 --> 01:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
impressed with your way of thinking
 
01:42:58.629 --> 01:42:58.639 align:start position:0%
about this and what you're doing and so
 
01:43:00.910 --> 01:43:00.920 align:start position:0%
so once again I kind of way confident
 
01:43:02.709 --> 01:43:02.719 align:start position:0%
that you're doing it right I love the
 
01:43:04.589 --> 01:43:04.599 align:start position:0%
idea that you prioritize the
 
01:43:07.669 --> 01:43:07.679 align:start position:0%
commissioner's strategic road map uh
 
01:43:10.270 --> 01:43:10.280 align:start position:0%
what what I think I'm going to ask you
 
01:43:13.669 --> 01:43:13.679 align:start position:0%
to do is to bump you to the front of the
 
01:43:17.229 --> 01:43:17.239 align:start position:0%
division three heing line so that you
 
01:43:19.709 --> 01:43:19.719 align:start position:0%
can walk through the road mapap and tell
 
01:43:22.270 --> 01:43:22.280 align:start position:0%
us what benchmarks or measures uh we
 
01:43:24.830 --> 01:43:24.840 align:start position:0%
should be anti ipating as we hear the
 
01:43:27.149 --> 01:43:27.159 align:start position:0%
rest of the budget and I'm sure the
 
01:43:28.790 --> 01:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner and and Nathan white have
 
01:43:31.750 --> 01:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
that in mind um but I will definitely
 
01:43:34.790 --> 01:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
bring it just and as my LBA to do that
 
01:43:39.109 --> 01:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
oh great okay thank you other
 
01:43:41.350 --> 01:43:41.360 align:start position:0%
questions seeing
 
01:43:51.870 --> 01:43:51.880 align:start position:0%

01:44:33.510 --> 01:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
here we go there we go my husband's it
 
01:44:35.030 --> 01:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
he would have told me to unplug it and

plug it back in see if it works so thank
 
01:44:39.390 --> 01:44:39.400 align:start position:0%
you John um good afternoon I'm Melissa
 
01:44:41.229 --> 01:44:41.239 align:start position:0%
Hardy I'm the division director for
 
01:44:43.189 --> 01:44:43.199 align:start position:0%
long-term supports and
 
01:44:47.589 --> 01:44:47.599 align:start position:0%
services um our division with ltss
 
01:44:49.350 --> 01:44:49.360 align:start position:0%
promotes the health and well-being of
 
01:44:51.510 --> 01:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
people and their families um throughout
 
01:44:53.790 --> 01:44:53.800 align:start position:0%
the lifespan so you hear me talk briefly
 
01:44:56.910 --> 01:44:56.920 align:start position:0%
about services that we provide um to
 
01:44:59.750 --> 01:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
Children um youth adults and people who
 
01:45:03.109 --> 01:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
are aging the ma um the majority of our
 
01:45:04.629 --> 01:45:04.639 align:start position:0%
programs are focused on Home and
 
01:45:07.030 --> 01:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
Community Based Services so providing
 
01:45:09.310 --> 01:45:09.320 align:start position:0%
Services through provider agencies that
 
01:45:12.189 --> 01:45:12.199 align:start position:0%
allow um individuals and families to
 
01:45:14.709 --> 01:45:14.719 align:start position:0%
remain um at home or in the community
 
01:45:16.750 --> 01:45:16.760 align:start position:0%
that they prefer to reside
 
01:45:19.750 --> 01:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
in um in our division we have three uh
 
01:45:22.669 --> 01:45:22.679 align:start position:0%
distinct bureaus first I'll start with
 
01:45:25.109 --> 01:45:25.119 align:start position:0%
uh what was formerly known as the Bureau
 
01:45:27.270 --> 01:45:27.280 align:start position:0%
of elderly and Adult Services which is
 
01:45:30.870 --> 01:45:30.880 align:start position:0%
now uh rebranded and named as the Bureau
 
01:45:32.870 --> 01:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
of adult and Aging
 
01:45:36.149 --> 01:45:36.159 align:start position:0%
Services we changed the name um in July
 
01:45:36.159 --> 01:45:36.910 align:start position:0%
Services we changed the name um in July
of

01:45:36.910 --> 01:45:36.920 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:45:39.790 --> 01:45:39.800 align:start position:0%
2024 and we moved away from the word
 
01:45:42.390 --> 01:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
elderly um when we talk about people who
 
01:45:44.109 --> 01:45:44.119 align:start position:0%
are aging and I have a little pin here
 
01:45:46.310 --> 01:45:46.320 align:start position:0%
that we all wear it says aging
 
01:45:49.430 --> 01:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
everyone's doing it um and and looking
 
01:45:52.390 --> 01:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
at research and um you know working with
 
01:45:54.030 --> 01:45:54.040 align:start position:0%
our partners along with the state plan
 
01:45:57.589 --> 01:45:57.599 align:start position:0%
on Aging the word elderly has a negative
 
01:46:00.510 --> 01:46:00.520 align:start position:0%
connotation to it and we're all aging um
 
01:46:03.910 --> 01:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
so we were happy and proud to to adopt
 
01:46:06.990 --> 01:46:07.000 align:start position:0%
that language change for our Bureau um
 
01:46:09.709 --> 01:46:09.719 align:start position:0%
and again that was in July of 2024 and
 
01:46:11.629 --> 01:46:11.639 align:start position:0%
we know New Hampshire is an aging State
 
01:46:14.830 --> 01:46:14.840 align:start position:0%
it's projected um by 2030 for over
 
01:46:17.229 --> 01:46:17.239 align:start position:0%
onethird of the state um to be over the
 
01:46:20.629 --> 01:46:20.639 align:start position:0%
age of 65 so um we're really looking at
 
01:46:22.910 --> 01:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
shifting how aging is perceived in the
 
01:46:25.350 --> 01:46:25.360 align:start position:0%
the culture of the Aging
 
01:46:29.510 --> 01:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
Services um in in hb2 uh we were uh
 
01:46:31.270 --> 01:46:31.280 align:start position:0%
given an investment in the system of
 
01:46:33.149 --> 01:46:33.159 align:start position:0%
care for healthy aging that I think a
 
01:46:36.229 --> 01:46:36.239 align:start position:0%
lot of you were um a part of and and so
 
01:46:38.990 --> 01:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for that um which established
 
01:46:41.109 --> 01:46:41.119 align:start position:0%
an implemented a comprehensive and
 
01:46:43.790 --> 01:46:43.800 align:start position:0%
coordinated system of care for for
 
01:46:46.390 --> 01:46:46.400 align:start position:0%
healthy aging and enables adults and
 
01:46:48.390 --> 01:46:48.400 align:start position:0%
adults with disabilities to have
 
01:46:51.990 --> 01:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
meaningful Choice um in the ability to
 
01:46:53.950 --> 01:46:53.960 align:start position:0%
receive the care when and where they
 
01:46:58.390 --> 01:46:58.400 align:start position:0%
want it um so that is on part in part of
 
01:47:00.629 --> 01:47:00.639 align:start position:0%
um the commissioner's road map um that
 
01:47:03.149 --> 01:47:03.159 align:start position:0%
you'll see that she presented on earlier
 
01:47:05.669 --> 01:47:05.679 align:start position:0%
uh as one of our strategic
 
01:47:08.109 --> 01:47:08.119 align:start position:0%
priorities also in the Bureau of adult
 
01:47:10.910 --> 01:47:10.920 align:start position:0%
and Aging Services we um have programs
 
01:47:12.790 --> 01:47:12.800 align:start position:0%
and services that we fund provider
 
01:47:16.229 --> 01:47:16.239 align:start position:0%
agencies to provide on our behalf um
 
01:47:18.430 --> 01:47:18.440 align:start position:0%
you're prob most of you are aware of our
 
01:47:20.669 --> 01:47:20.679 align:start position:0%
Medicaid waiver program under aging and
 
01:47:24.030 --> 01:47:24.040 align:start position:0%
adult Services um the CFI progam program
 
01:47:26.270 --> 01:47:26.280 align:start position:0%
the choices for Independence waiver it's
 
01:47:29.589 --> 01:47:29.599 align:start position:0%
a Medicaid waiver for individuals who
 
01:47:31.629 --> 01:47:31.639 align:start position:0%
meet nursing home level of care but
 
01:47:34.350 --> 01:47:34.360 align:start position:0%
prefer to receive their care in the
 
01:47:37.189 --> 01:47:37.199 align:start position:0%
community so we uh administer that
 
01:47:39.750 --> 01:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
program uh along with our case
 
01:47:41.750 --> 01:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
management agencies and provider
 
01:47:44.189 --> 01:47:44.199 align:start position:0%
agencies through the Medicaid
 
01:47:47.350 --> 01:47:47.360 align:start position:0%
waiver we also provide funding for
 
01:47:49.750 --> 01:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
nutrition programs so Meals on Wheels
 
01:47:53.310 --> 01:47:53.320 align:start position:0%
and congregate meal programs um we in
 
01:47:57.109 --> 01:47:57.119 align:start position:0%
2024 we funded meals for over 2. uh we
 
01:47:59.430 --> 01:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
funded over 2.4 million meals in the
 
01:48:03.149 --> 01:48:03.159 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire to over um 15,000
 
01:48:04.550 --> 01:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
um Unique
 
01:48:08.189 --> 01:48:08.199 align:start position:0%
Individuals um some some interesting
 
01:48:10.750 --> 01:48:10.760 align:start position:0%
feedback from nutrition services and I
 
01:48:12.669 --> 01:48:12.679 align:start position:0%
think one that hits me when I see it is
 
01:48:15.189 --> 01:48:15.199 align:start position:0%
that 41% of people who receive Meals on
 
01:48:17.709 --> 01:48:17.719 align:start position:0%
Wheels say the Meals on Wheels driver is
 
01:48:20.470 --> 01:48:20.480 align:start position:0%
the only person that they will see all
 
01:48:23.149 --> 01:48:23.159 align:start position:0%
week so that's very important you know
 
01:48:24.790 --> 01:48:24.800 align:start position:0%
it's more than just a meal delivery
 
01:48:26.870 --> 01:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
service it's really uh it can be a
 
01:48:29.589 --> 01:48:29.599 align:start position:0%
welfare check on folks um and they're
 
01:48:32.189 --> 01:48:32.199 align:start position:0%
really eyes on um to the people that we
 
01:48:35.030 --> 01:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
serve so it's a real um uh value ad
 
01:48:36.790 --> 01:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
service for
 
01:48:41.390 --> 01:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
us another um uh service that we provide

needed representative
 
02:00:46.430 --> 02:00:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:49.629 --> 02:00:49.639 align:start position:0%
chairman uh what I'm going to say is
 
02:00:52.790 --> 02:00:52.800 align:start position:0%
should not be viewed as a criticism
 
02:00:53.750 --> 02:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:00:56.790 --> 02:00:56.800 align:start position:0%
department uh I have a constituent more
 
02:01:01.950 --> 02:01:01.960 align:start position:0%
than one actually that called me uh this
 
02:01:04.709 --> 02:01:04.719 align:start position:0%
particular person was in New Hampshire
 
02:01:08.109 --> 02:01:08.119 align:start position:0%
hospital for more than three months
 
02:01:11.550 --> 02:01:11.560 align:start position:0%
which tells you was a very severe case
 
02:01:14.790 --> 02:01:14.800 align:start position:0%
because the actual time is 3 to five
 
02:01:17.790 --> 02:01:17.800 align:start position:0%
days something along that he was
 
02:01:19.830 --> 02:01:19.840 align:start position:0%
referred to a mental health
 
02:01:22.629 --> 02:01:22.639 align:start position:0%
center uh he's been
 
02:01:24.750 --> 02:01:24.760 align:start position:0%
getting good care and
 
02:01:27.629 --> 02:01:27.639 align:start position:0%
medication he feels
 
02:01:30.709 --> 02:01:30.719 align:start position:0%
tremendously the need for
 
02:01:33.390 --> 02:01:33.400 align:start position:0%
counseling that there is no counseling
 
02:01:36.589 --> 02:01:36.599 align:start position:0%
for him in that middle Health
 
02:01:36.599 --> 02:01:38.629 align:start position:0%
for him in that middle Health
Center

02:01:38.629 --> 02:01:38.639 align:start position:0%
Center
 
02:01:38.639 --> 02:01:41.430 align:start position:0%
Center
and

02:01:41.430 --> 02:01:41.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:01:44.470 --> 02:01:44.480 align:start position:0%
the I I hear this
 
02:01:47.830 --> 02:01:47.840 align:start position:0%
often in in terms of not only midal
 
02:01:51.990 --> 02:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
Health Centers he he was referred to
 
02:01:56.069 --> 02:01:56.079 align:start position:0%
three private groups all of whom said we
 
02:01:58.750 --> 02:01:58.760 align:start position:0%
can't do a thing for you for at least
 
02:01:58.760 --> 02:01:59.830 align:start position:0%
can't do a thing for you for at least
six

02:01:59.830 --> 02:01:59.840 align:start position:0%
six
 
02:02:03.830 --> 02:02:03.840 align:start position:0%
months now I'm I'm sure you hear this
 
02:02:07.550 --> 02:02:07.560 align:start position:0%
every day there's nothing new about it
 
02:02:10.390 --> 02:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
what I'm concerned about is there
 
02:02:15.350 --> 02:02:15.360 align:start position:0%
anything we can do to help out uh to
 
02:02:15.360 --> 02:02:16.709 align:start position:0%
anything we can do to help out uh to
provide

02:02:16.709 --> 02:02:16.719 align:start position:0%
provide
 
02:02:18.550 --> 02:02:18.560 align:start position:0%
services I
 
02:02:22.830 --> 02:02:22.840 align:start position:0%
know uh I I'm just too old to go back
 
02:02:26.149 --> 02:02:26.159 align:start position:0%
and do that kind of work again if I wish
 
02:02:30.430 --> 02:02:30.440 align:start position:0%
I could uh but is is there anything we
 
02:02:35.910 --> 02:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
can do for you uh to help these
 
02:02:39.430 --> 02:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
individuals who at the present time are
 
02:02:45.069 --> 02:02:45.079 align:start position:0%
not getting care because there isn't uh
 
02:02:49.109 --> 02:02:49.119 align:start position:0%
sufficient Personnel to provide that
 
02:02:52.030 --> 02:02:52.040 align:start position:0%
care so thank you very much for sharing
 
02:02:55.669 --> 02:02:55.679 align:start position:0%
that um personal um interaction that
 
02:02:58.270 --> 02:02:58.280 align:start position:0%
you've had with a constituent and we do
 
02:03:00.870 --> 02:03:00.880 align:start position:0%
hear that that is an area that needs
 
02:03:03.430 --> 02:03:03.440 align:start position:0%
Improvement access to care is so
 
02:03:07.229 --> 02:03:07.239 align:start position:0%
critical especially um as people are
 
02:03:10.629 --> 02:03:10.639 align:start position:0%
seeking it and so we're doing multiple
 
02:03:13.470 --> 02:03:13.480 align:start position:0%
efforts we have found as you heard in
 
02:03:15.830 --> 02:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
the mission zero discussion that it
 
02:03:18.350 --> 02:03:18.360 align:start position:0%
isn't just one solution it's multiple
 
02:03:21.950 --> 02:03:21.960 align:start position:0%
Solutions and so Workforce and not not
 
02:03:24.750 --> 02:03:24.760 align:start position:0%
just looking at the workforce in um
 
02:03:28.669 --> 02:03:28.679 align:start position:0%
having it um people go to school get you
 
02:03:30.950 --> 02:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
know certain degrees and then enter the
 
02:03:32.870 --> 02:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
workforce and we all get a little
 
02:03:35.109 --> 02:03:35.119 align:start position:0%
frustrated because that takes time we're
 
02:03:37.430 --> 02:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
looking at expanding the workforce and
 
02:03:40.310 --> 02:03:40.320 align:start position:0%
so who can provide services who can be
 
02:03:43.149 --> 02:03:43.159 align:start position:0%
the person that is able to support
 
02:03:45.390 --> 02:03:45.400 align:start position:0%
someone in the community and it may not
 
02:03:48.629 --> 02:03:48.639 align:start position:0%
always need to be a clinician it can be
 
02:03:52.549 --> 02:03:52.559 align:start position:0%
a peer and it can be community and how
 
02:03:54.709 --> 02:03:54.719 align:start position:0%
do we build communities to be able to
 
02:03:56.950 --> 02:03:56.960 align:start position:0%
support someone um who's in need of
 
02:03:59.790 --> 02:03:59.800 align:start position:0%
those services so you are going to hear
 
02:04:02.470 --> 02:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
a lot about this in the upcoming session
 
02:04:05.310 --> 02:04:05.320 align:start position:0%
um there are multiple bills to address
 
02:04:09.549 --> 02:04:09.559 align:start position:0%
this um but we we totally understand and
 
02:04:13.350 --> 02:04:13.360 align:start position:0%
um anyone who um is in our system
 
02:04:15.470 --> 02:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
deserves to have those services
 
02:04:17.750 --> 02:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
available when they need them and it is
 
02:04:20.709 --> 02:04:20.719 align:start position:0%
all of our jobs to make that happen
 
02:04:23.910 --> 02:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
thank you other
 
02:04:35.669 --> 02:04:35.679 align:start position:0%

02:04:56.199 --> 02:04:56.990 align:start position:0%

may need to reach out to specific
 
02:06:44.310 --> 02:06:44.320 align:start position:0%
populations that we can assist with so
 
02:06:45.870 --> 02:06:45.880 align:start position:0%
we can connect them with some of those
 
02:06:45.880 --> 02:06:47.350 align:start position:0%
we can connect them with some of those
specialized

02:06:47.350 --> 02:06:47.360 align:start position:0%
specialized
 
02:06:49.750 --> 02:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
populations there are others that need

02:07:17.750 --> 02:07:17.760 align:start position:0%

those are individual clients or other
 
02:07:22.830 --> 02:07:22.840 align:start position:0%
fellow state workers from different
 
02:07:27.189 --> 02:07:27.199 align:start position:0%
departments who uh are in need of
 
02:07:29.629 --> 02:07:29.639 align:start position:0%
assistance we also have the refugee
 
02:07:31.669 --> 02:07:31.679 align:start position:0%
program that runs the office as well so
 
02:07:34.109 --> 02:07:34.119 align:start position:0%
we administer a few different grants and
 
02:07:38.189 --> 02:07:38.199 align:start position:0%
work with service providers to uh ensure
 
02:07:41.589 --> 02:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
the refugees and other o eligible
 
02:07:44.229 --> 02:07:44.239 align:start position:0%
clients who come over are able to uh
 
02:07:54.629 --> 02:07:54.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:56.629 --> 02:07:56.639 align:start position:0%
is your office relatively your division
 
02:08:00.189 --> 02:08:00.199 align:start position:0%
relatively new I don't remember it from
 
02:08:02.510 --> 02:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
past this office didn't have a director
 
02:08:06.510 --> 02:08:06.520 align:start position:0%
for two years between 2020 and 2022 so
 
02:08:09.790 --> 02:08:09.800 align:start position:0%
that could be why I joined in February
 
02:08:12.790 --> 02:08:12.800 align:start position:0%
2022 and I think missed this event prior
 
02:08:15.229 --> 02:08:15.239 align:start position:0%
so it could have felt like four years
 
02:08:18.390 --> 02:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
okay and how big a division is is your
 
02:08:22.069 --> 02:08:22.079 align:start position:0%
section 11 currently 11
 
02:08:25.910 --> 02:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Edwards uh
 
02:08:28.350 --> 02:08:28.360 align:start position:0%
thank you we we've met several times to
 
02:08:33.069 --> 02:08:33.079 align:start position:0%
talk about uh your programs and uh I I I
 
02:08:36.629 --> 02:08:36.639 align:start position:0%
I want I want to just uh help your your
 
02:08:38.870 --> 02:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
program out and and help the people in
 
02:08:40.589 --> 02:08:40.599 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire understand what your
 
02:08:42.669 --> 02:08:42.679 align:start position:0%
program does and what I think it's
 
02:08:44.229 --> 02:08:44.239 align:start position:0%
important for people to understand what
 
02:08:49.310 --> 02:08:49.320 align:start position:0%
your program doesn't do I I think um the
 
02:08:52.870 --> 02:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
word Equity has become um politically
 
02:08:56.830 --> 02:08:56.840 align:start position:0%
suspect in many groups uh and so with
 
02:09:00.189 --> 02:09:00.199 align:start position:0%
that in your title uh I I I want to make
 
02:09:04.109 --> 02:09:04.119 align:start position:0%
sure that um we're clear on on what you
 
02:09:07.069 --> 02:09:07.079 align:start position:0%
all are doing I I think it's absolutely
 
02:09:10.069 --> 02:09:10.079 align:start position:0%
appropriate and imperative that we
 
02:09:12.870 --> 02:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
know our state
 
02:09:16.189 --> 02:09:16.199 align:start position:0%
demographics and that we're seeking ways
 
02:09:19.069 --> 02:09:19.079 align:start position:0%
to ensure that all of the demographics
 
02:09:23.750 --> 02:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
in our state have good strong equal
 
02:09:26.950 --> 02:09:26.960 align:start position:0%
access to health care and that you're
 
02:09:29.589 --> 02:09:29.599 align:start position:0%
helping to identify
 
02:09:33.270 --> 02:09:33.280 align:start position:0%
barriers uh that may get in the way of
 
02:09:34.510 --> 02:09:34.520 align:start position:0%
that equal
 
02:09:37.030 --> 02:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
access uh and you're trying to eliminate
 
02:09:39.470 --> 02:09:39.480 align:start position:0%
them education and
 
02:09:41.629 --> 02:09:41.639 align:start position:0%
communication what so that's what you're
 
02:09:45.149 --> 02:09:45.159 align:start position:0%
doing I believe what you are not doing
 
02:09:46.870 --> 02:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
and it's important for people to
 
02:09:49.830 --> 02:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
understand this is I I don't think you
 
02:09:52.390 --> 02:09:52.400 align:start position:0%
guys are looking
 
02:09:56.149 --> 02:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
to disproportionately Advantage any
 
02:10:00.350 --> 02:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
demographic to get Superior or frontof
 
02:10:02.350 --> 02:10:02.360 align:start position:0%
the line kind of care you're you're
 
02:10:04.990 --> 02:10:05.000 align:start position:0%
looking to make sure there's equality in
 
02:10:08.430 --> 02:10:08.440 align:start position:0%
the access is is is that fair to
 
02:10:10.790 --> 02:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
say I think that is fair to say
 
02:10:13.910 --> 02:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
representative okay follow up follow up
 
02:10:16.310 --> 02:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
okay and then the other part of this
 
02:10:19.910 --> 02:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
that I think is in your VIN diagram is
 
02:10:22.390 --> 02:10:22.400 align:start position:0%
uh there's a lot of concern about the
 
02:10:27.270 --> 02:10:27.280 align:start position:0%
state spending money on um ill the term
 
02:10:29.430 --> 02:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
that's used usually as illegal
 
02:10:32.270 --> 02:10:32.280 align:start position:0%
immigrants and talking to Mr Litman and
 
02:10:36.750 --> 02:10:36.760 align:start position:0%
you and others uh I believe that you
 
02:10:39.310 --> 02:10:39.320 align:start position:0%
have a strong program where you're
 
02:10:42.189 --> 02:10:42.199 align:start position:0%
making sure that any you know Refugee or
 
02:10:44.790 --> 02:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
any non us-born
 
02:10:49.229 --> 02:10:49.239 align:start position:0%
um um patient is run through an
 
02:10:51.510 --> 02:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
eligibility system to make sure they're
 
02:10:53.310 --> 02:10:53.320 align:start position:0%
here legally and that they're getting
 
02:10:56.310 --> 02:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
the services that between the federal
 
02:10:58.669 --> 02:10:58.679 align:start position:0%
government's uh authorizations and
 
02:11:02.189 --> 02:11:02.199 align:start position:0%
permissions and our own that uh we we
 
02:11:06.589 --> 02:11:06.599 align:start position:0%
are not giving out um health care
 
02:11:10.750 --> 02:11:10.760 align:start position:0%
benefits to um the Goda ways the people
 
02:11:12.830 --> 02:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
who really ought not to be in the
 
02:11:16.990 --> 02:11:17.000 align:start position:0%
country and who are hiding so so to turn
 
02:11:20.950 --> 02:11:20.960 align:start position:0%
that into a question do do you think
 
02:11:20.960 --> 02:11:21.950 align:start position:0%
that into a question do do you think
that

02:11:21.950 --> 02:11:21.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:11:24.510 --> 02:11:24.520 align:start position:0%
um it would be fair to tell the people
 
02:11:26.830 --> 02:11:26.840 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire that we have strong
 
02:11:30.589 --> 02:11:30.599 align:start position:0%
programs to make sure that those foreign
 
02:11:35.430 --> 02:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
born people who are in New Hampshire are
 
02:11:37.589 --> 02:11:37.599 align:start position:0%
receiving authorized care and if they're
 
02:11:40.830 --> 02:11:40.840 align:start position:0%
not here legally in a legal status that
 
02:11:44.310 --> 02:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
we have control mechanisms to prevent
 
02:11:48.629 --> 02:11:48.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:51.310 --> 02:11:51.320 align:start position:0%
services as you noted the refugee
 
02:11:53.470 --> 02:11:53.480 align:start position:0%
program is a federally funded and
 
02:11:55.270 --> 02:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
administered program so there are
 
02:11:58.510 --> 02:11:58.520 align:start position:0%
specific uh regulations on who can be a
 
02:12:01.030 --> 02:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
client uh all refugees are vetted
 
02:12:03.589 --> 02:12:03.599 align:start position:0%
overseas The Limited categories of
 
02:12:06.830 --> 02:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
others who can receive benefits uh also
 
02:12:10.030 --> 02:12:10.040 align:start position:0%
have specific requirements all have
 
02:12:13.750 --> 02:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
legal status to be here so so again I
 
02:12:16.310 --> 02:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
think you're confirming that we're
 
02:12:18.430 --> 02:12:18.440 align:start position:0%
positively giving care to those who are
 
02:12:21.229 --> 02:12:21.239 align:start position:0%
authorized under various programs the
 
02:12:23.069 --> 02:12:23.079 align:start position:0%
question is actually the negative of
 
02:12:25.470 --> 02:12:25.480 align:start position:0%
that we're also ensuring that those
 
02:12:27.990 --> 02:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
people who are not here under a legal
 
02:12:33.069 --> 02:12:33.079 align:start position:0%
category are bented or blocked or dis uh
 
02:12:36.350 --> 02:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
disadvantaged to receiving care that
 
02:12:38.109 --> 02:12:38.119 align:start position:0%
they're not authorized to we're not
 
02:12:41.870 --> 02:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
spending money on on the Goda
 
02:12:44.870 --> 02:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
ways and I hopefully that's a yes kind
 
02:12:49.390 --> 02:12:49.400 align:start position:0%
of a simple yes for the our program
 
02:12:49.400 --> 02:12:52.030 align:start position:0%
of a simple yes for the our program
specifically

02:12:52.030 --> 02:12:52.040 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
02:12:55.750 --> 02:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:00.669 --> 02:13:00.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:03.549 --> 02:13:03.559 align:start position:0%
am other
 
02:13:05.830 --> 02:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none okay thank you
 
02:13:12.870 --> 02:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:15.790 --> 02:13:15.800 align:start position:0%
you and last but certainly not least uh
 
02:13:18.149 --> 02:13:18.159 align:start position:0%
Melissa St SE was scheduled but filling
 
02:13:41.950 --> 02:13:41.960 align:start position:0%

02:20:25.070 --> 02:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
would suggest um to the representative
 
02:20:26.630 --> 02:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
that I would be more than happy to get
 
02:20:29.469 --> 02:20:29.479 align:start position:0%
them into contact with the executive
 
02:20:32.910 --> 02:20:32.920 align:start position:0%
director um um over with um the office
 
02:20:34.510 --> 02:20:34.520 align:start position:0%
of professional licensure to talk about
 
02:20:35.950 --> 02:20:35.960 align:start position:0%
what they're doing around reciprocity
 
02:20:37.870 --> 02:20:37.880 align:start position:0%
because that's beyond the scope of our
 
02:20:40.630 --> 02:20:40.640 align:start position:0%
agency's uh work we we don't author we
 
02:20:44.389 --> 02:20:44.399 align:start position:0%
do not license um um individuals uh uh
 
02:20:47.230 --> 02:20:47.240 align:start position:0%
professionals but we do um license
 
02:20:48.750 --> 02:20:48.760 align:start position:0%
facilities and that's where I'm going to
 
02:20:51.190 --> 02:20:51.200 align:start position:0%
segue it over to dine Shan
 
02:20:53.790 --> 02:20:53.800 align:start position:0%
Ley so thank you for the question it was
 
02:20:55.710 --> 02:20:55.720 align:start position:0%
an important question to make the
 
02:20:58.070 --> 02:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
distinction that the bureau that um I'm
 
02:21:00.270 --> 02:21:00.280 align:start position:0%
speaking on behalf of is um for
 
02:21:01.950 --> 02:21:01.960 align:start position:0%
facilities for all Health Facilities
 
02:21:04.429 --> 02:21:04.439 align:start position:0%
nursing homes we do the um but not the
 
02:21:06.590 --> 02:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
individuals so we'll get that
 
02:21:06.600 --> 02:21:08.910 align:start position:0%
individuals so we'll get that
information

02:21:08.910 --> 02:21:08.920 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:21:12.150 --> 02:21:12.160 align:start position:0%
yes there was another
 
02:21:14.590 --> 02:21:14.600 align:start position:0%
question oh it was another you said this
 
02:21:19.110 --> 02:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:21.950 --> 02:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
here oh okay I'm
 
02:21:24.150 --> 02:21:24.160 align:start position:0%
sorry representative mlan did you have
 
02:21:26.309 --> 02:21:26.319 align:start position:0%
something yeah one
 
02:21:29.950 --> 02:21:29.960 align:start position:0%
sec I noticed on on the contact sheet I
 
02:21:32.230 --> 02:21:32.240 align:start position:0%
I was unaware of this position um you
 
02:21:35.469 --> 02:21:35.479 align:start position:0%
have a position of hitsman and office of
 
02:21:37.870 --> 02:21:37.880 align:start position:0%
long-term care armman I was unaware of
 
02:21:39.870 --> 02:21:39.880 align:start position:0%
those positions could you maybe let us
 
02:21:42.309 --> 02:21:42.319 align:start position:0%
know what their roles are and and you
 
02:21:44.030 --> 02:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
know the scope of their powers kind of
 
02:21:46.910 --> 02:21:46.920 align:start position:0%
thing yes um and if Melissa Saint SI
 
02:21:48.750 --> 02:21:48.760 align:start position:0%
were here she would have not have missed
 
02:21:50.790 --> 02:21:50.800 align:start position:0%
because under her umbrella also falls
 
02:21:52.750 --> 02:21:52.760 align:start position:0%
the administrative Appeals Unit as well
 
02:21:55.349 --> 02:21:55.359 align:start position:0%
as the um budman's office the office of
 
02:21:58.590 --> 02:21:58.600 align:start position:0%
um budsman is statur created it is under
 
02:22:00.070 --> 02:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and services
 
02:22:01.670 --> 02:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
but they're specifically designated to
 
02:22:03.110 --> 02:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
be independent from the Department in
 
02:22:05.469 --> 02:22:05.479 align:start position:0%
other words they're enabled to provide
 
02:22:09.070 --> 02:22:09.080 align:start position:0%
um Services uh to do investigations uh
 
02:22:11.190 --> 02:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
uh individuals who have constituent
 
02:22:13.550 --> 02:22:13.560 align:start position:0%
inquiries or concerns over Services can
 
02:22:16.230 --> 02:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
certainly go to the ombudsman's office
 
02:22:19.429 --> 02:22:19.439 align:start position:0%
uh for assistance um and they serve a
 
02:22:21.510 --> 02:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
very important role for advocating on
 
02:22:23.469 --> 02:22:23.479 align:start position:0%
behalf of citizens of New Hampshire
 
02:22:25.030 --> 02:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
based upon concerns they may have with
 
02:22:26.990 --> 02:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
the department now with that said
 
02:22:28.710 --> 02:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
represent mlan I need to make a
 
02:22:30.150 --> 02:22:30.160 align:start position:0%
distinction there is a second
 
02:22:32.429 --> 02:22:32.439 align:start position:0%
ombudsman's office it's called the
 
02:22:34.429 --> 02:22:34.439 align:start position:0%
long-term care ombudsman's office and
 
02:22:37.950 --> 02:22:37.960 align:start position:0%
Sue buckon is the long-term care um uh
 
02:22:40.550 --> 02:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
on budsman they go by olito here we go
 
02:22:42.550 --> 02:22:42.560 align:start position:0%
initial I mean acronyms but um by the
 
02:22:44.990 --> 02:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
office of long-term care on budsman and
 
02:22:47.270 --> 02:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
they are specific to the area of
 
02:22:49.830 --> 02:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
long-term care so we're talking over in
 
02:22:52.230 --> 02:22:52.240 align:start position:0%
dorin um area that there's an overlap so
 
02:22:53.550 --> 02:22:53.560 align:start position:0%
I'm going to turn it over to Dorene to
 
02:22:55.429 --> 02:22:55.439 align:start position:0%
talk to you about that other um busman's
 
02:23:00.030 --> 02:23:00.040 align:start position:0%
office and how her um her uh folks who
 
02:23:02.950 --> 02:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
work on lure deals with the um bussman's
 
02:23:05.870 --> 02:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
office thank you so our we have a
 
02:23:07.790 --> 02:23:07.800 align:start position:0%
certification team we are the state
 
02:23:12.790 --> 02:23:12.800 align:start position:0%
agency for the federal um CMS um and we
 
02:23:15.309 --> 02:23:15.319 align:start position:0%
work very closely our in our residential
 
02:23:18.510 --> 02:23:18.520 align:start position:0%
settings nursing homes and um assisted
 
02:23:20.910 --> 02:23:20.920 align:start position:0%
living facilities with suckon and her
 
02:23:23.990 --> 02:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
team to make sure we're looking at
 
02:23:25.670 --> 02:23:25.680 align:start position:0%
investigations or
 
02:23:27.950 --> 02:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
allegations from the lens of the
 
02:23:30.230 --> 02:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
facility and is the facility compliant
 
02:23:31.910 --> 02:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
with rules and regulations the
 
02:23:34.389 --> 02:23:34.399 align:start position:0%
ombudsman's office is working from the
 
02:23:37.030 --> 02:23:37.040 align:start position:0%
lens of the resident or the patient
 
02:23:39.710 --> 02:23:39.720 align:start position:0%
making sure that their needs and their
 
02:23:42.349 --> 02:23:42.359 align:start position:0%
are being met um so we'll often
 
02:23:45.190 --> 02:23:45.200 align:start position:0%
collaborate from both lenses to make
 
02:23:48.790 --> 02:23:48.800 align:start position:0%
sure that um every individual is being
 
02:23:50.550 --> 02:23:50.560 align:start position:0%
served in the manner that they have have
 
02:23:54.150 --> 02:23:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:59.429 --> 02:23:59.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:01.870 --> 02:24:01.880 align:start position:0%
delus thank you Mr chair this is more of
 
02:24:04.349 --> 02:24:04.359 align:start position:0%
a statement nice to see you
 
02:24:08.389 --> 02:24:08.399 align:start position:0%
again um as far as the Ombudsman I I
 
02:24:10.429 --> 02:24:10.439 align:start position:0%
probably shouldn't even direct it to you
 
02:24:14.790 --> 02:24:14.800 align:start position:0%
but to representative mlan I was in need
 
02:24:17.150 --> 02:24:17.160 align:start position:0%
of the Ombudsman and had found out about
 
02:24:21.230 --> 02:24:21.240 align:start position:0%
that office years ago and as a as a
 
02:24:24.910 --> 02:24:24.920 align:start position:0%
private citizen at the time uh one of my
 
02:24:27.309 --> 02:24:27.319 align:start position:0%
relatives I feel was not being treated
 
02:24:30.150 --> 02:24:30.160 align:start position:0%
well and had broken ribs and a broken
 
02:24:32.750 --> 02:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
arm and so I called the office of the um
 
02:24:35.030 --> 02:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
budsman because I didn't know how to
 
02:24:37.389 --> 02:24:37.399 align:start position:0%
deal with it with the facility and then
 
02:24:40.950 --> 02:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
that they took that out of my hands and
 
02:24:44.550 --> 02:24:44.560 align:start position:0%
the utsman went in without warning and
 
02:24:47.790 --> 02:24:47.800 align:start position:0%
just checked on that patient and um I
 
02:24:50.990 --> 02:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
think the that was amazing and the
 
02:24:53.830 --> 02:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
treatment that my
 
02:24:56.590 --> 02:24:56.600 align:start position:0%
relative received after that was much
 
02:25:01.389 --> 02:25:01.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:04.349 --> 02:25:04.359 align:start position:0%
much other
 
02:25:06.670 --> 02:25:06.680 align:start position:0%
questions I don't see any okay thank you
 
02:25:06.680 --> 02:25:09.309 align:start position:0%
questions I don't see any okay thank you
very

02:25:09.309 --> 02:25:09.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:12.429 --> 02:25:12.439 align:start position:0%
much and we do have one more speaker uh
 
02:25:14.190 --> 02:25:14.200 align:start position:0%

02:25:38.590 --> 02:25:38.600 align:start position:0%
members of the Commission on Aging so
 
02:25:42.110 --> 02:25:42.120 align:start position:0%

02:25:45.429 --> 02:25:45.439 align:start position:0%
people's hats and rolls and all of this
 
02:25:48.110 --> 02:25:48.120 align:start position:0%

a very vulnerable
 
02:25:54.190 --> 02:25:54.200 align:start position:0%

question about a particular policy point
 
02:26:28.110 --> 02:26:28.120 align:start position:0%

researched the answer to the question we
 
02:26:35.790 --> 02:26:35.800 align:start position:0%
will dive in and research it's a 26
 
02:26:39.469 --> 02:26:39.479 align:start position:0%
member commission um of of very engaged
 
02:26:42.910 --> 02:26:42.920 align:start position:0%
people we have um actually we have one
 
02:26:45.710 --> 02:26:45.720 align:start position:0%
state senator two three state reps 13
 
02:26:47.830 --> 02:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
people appointed by the governor and

eight state agencies represented on the
commission

02:26:51.309 --> 02:26:51.319 align:start position:0%
commission
 
02:26:53.670 --> 02:26:53.680 align:start position:0%
so um diving more into why the
 
02:26:57.790 --> 02:26:57.800 align:start position:0%
commission was created um you you have a
 
02:27:00.670 --> 02:27:00.680 align:start position:0%
one it's two-sided but it's one piece
 
02:27:03.230 --> 02:27:03.240 align:start position:0%
piece of paper um it's the last two
 
02:27:05.990 --> 02:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
pages of our annual report and on the
 
02:27:08.230 --> 02:27:08.240 align:start position:0%
side that has the graph that's on at the
 
02:27:12.030 --> 02:27:12.040 align:start position:0%
bottom corner says page 40 um uh you
 
02:27:16.349 --> 02:27:16.359 align:start position:0%
will see um data from the I think it's
 
02:27:18.950 --> 02:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh the department uh it's the office New
 
02:27:20.190 --> 02:27:20.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire office of planning and
 
02:27:21.550 --> 02:27:21.560 align:start position:0%
development within the Department of
 
02:27:23.790 --> 02:27:23.800 align:start position:0%
Business and economic Affairs develop
 
02:27:25.590 --> 02:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
this data making uh population
 
02:27:27.670 --> 02:27:27.680 align:start position:0%
projections from 2020 to
 
02:27:30.550 --> 02:27:30.560 align:start position:0%
2050 um and this is for the population
 
02:27:33.630 --> 02:27:33.640 align:start position:0%
aged 65 plus if you notice the dashed
 
02:27:37.830 --> 02:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
green line that's the 85 Plus population
 
02:27:40.030 --> 02:27:40.040 align:start position:0%
and as all of you know government is
 
02:27:42.469 --> 02:27:42.479 align:start position:0%
created by people policy makers such as
 
02:27:45.030 --> 02:27:45.040 align:start position:0%
yourself uh for the people in response
 
02:27:47.750 --> 02:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
to who the population is and so that is

state so the four-page handout the one
 
02:28:03.309 --> 02:28:03.319 align:start position:0%
that looks like this is the executive
 
02:28:05.990 --> 02:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
summary of our annual

urges policy makers uh to see our

growing older adult population for the
 
02:28:18.190 --> 02:28:18.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity all of us are if you look

around this room that's
 
02:28:24.750 --> 02:28:24.760 align:start position:0%
us um page two names the four
 
02:28:27.030 --> 02:28:27.040 align:start position:0%
overarching priorities the commission
 
02:28:28.870 --> 02:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
has identified for the state in response
 
02:28:30.190 --> 02:28:30.200 align:start position:0%
to changing
 
02:28:32.389 --> 02:28:32.399 align:start position:0%
demographics we need to strengthen our
 
02:28:35.190 --> 02:28:35.200 align:start position:0%
systems of care for healthy aging prior
 
02:28:38.030 --> 02:28:38.040 align:start position:0%
to 2023 the last time the system of
 
02:28:39.950 --> 02:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
services for older adults was
 
02:28:42.349 --> 02:28:42.359 align:start position:0%
significantly addressed was actually in
 
02:28:45.349 --> 02:28:45.359 align:start position:0%
1998 uh with legislation Under the
 
02:28:48.150 --> 02:28:48.160 align:start position:0%
Umbrella of shaping tomorrow's future uh
 
02:28:51.030 --> 02:28:51.040 align:start position:0%
shaping tomorrow's choices the work done
 
02:28:53.070 --> 02:28:53.080 align:start position:0%
during the last budget cycle uh to
 
02:28:54.429 --> 02:28:54.439 align:start position:0%
establish the system of care that
 
02:28:56.950 --> 02:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
Melissa Hardy uh referenced needs to be
 
02:28:59.309 --> 02:28:59.319 align:start position:0%
built upon during this and upcoming
 
02:29:01.990 --> 02:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
legislative sessions one item in
 
02:29:05.190 --> 02:29:05.200 align:start position:0%
particular from uh House Bill 2 from
 
02:29:07.630 --> 02:29:07.640 align:start position:0%
2023 was a call for a Medicaid rate
 
02:29:09.230 --> 02:29:09.240 align:start position:0%
study of Home and Community Based
 
02:29:11.590 --> 02:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
Services and for the upcoming budget
 
02:29:13.389 --> 02:29:13.399 align:start position:0%
proposal to reflect changes based on
 
02:29:15.110 --> 02:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
that study hopefully you'll have an
 
02:29:17.469 --> 02:29:17.479 align:start position:0%
opportunity to review that
 
02:29:20.550 --> 02:29:20.560 align:start position:0%
soon um we also call for an effort to
 
02:29:22.309 --> 02:29:22.319 align:start position:0%
grow our Direct Care Workforce that
 
02:29:24.469 --> 02:29:24.479 align:start position:0%
provides long-term services and supports
 
02:29:26.790 --> 02:29:26.800 align:start position:0%
not only in our nursing facilities but
 
02:29:29.349 --> 02:29:29.359 align:start position:0%
in in our communities and in people's
 
02:29:31.510 --> 02:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
homes and Under the Umbrella of
 
02:29:33.469 --> 02:29:33.479 align:start position:0%
advancing age-friendly policy systems
 
02:29:35.269 --> 02:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
and environments the commission calls
 
02:29:37.269 --> 02:29:37.279 align:start position:0%
for efforts to create age inclusive
 
02:29:39.830 --> 02:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
workplaces to engage our older workers I
 
02:29:41.469 --> 02:29:41.479 align:start position:0%
think it was a mentioned just now how do
 
02:29:44.269 --> 02:29:44.279 align:start position:0%
we bring back our our retired nurses we
 
02:29:48.630 --> 02:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
need them um we also uh talk about
 
02:29:50.230 --> 02:29:50.240 align:start position:0%
ensuring that our new hous hous in
 
02:29:52.070 --> 02:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
builds are smart builds and that they
 
02:29:54.389 --> 02:29:54.399 align:start position:0%
are they are age ready with no barrier
 
02:29:56.910 --> 02:29:56.920 align:start position:0%
entries and bed and baths on the first
 
02:29:59.309 --> 02:29:59.319 align:start position:0%
floor um and that we Foster Civic
 
02:30:01.429 --> 02:30:01.439 align:start position:0%
engagement and make efforts to address
 
02:30:04.510 --> 02:30:04.520 align:start position:0%
social isolation among um among many of
 
02:30:05.830 --> 02:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
the other items that are named in our
 
02:30:09.150 --> 02:30:09.160 align:start position:0%
full report uh finally we call for the
 
02:30:10.670 --> 02:30:10.680 align:start position:0%
development of a long-term vision for
 
02:30:13.590 --> 02:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
change a ro map of policy considerations
 
02:30:16.030 --> 02:30:16.040 align:start position:0%
to create the future that we seek many
 
02:30:19.030 --> 02:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
of the changes need incremental changes
 
02:30:20.630 --> 02:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
to build to them
 
02:30:23.030 --> 02:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
um we have branded this plan the agw
 
02:30:27.070 --> 02:30:27.080 align:start position:0%
plan uh HW NH plan excuse me uh the plan
 
02:30:29.389 --> 02:30:29.399 align:start position:0%
has not yet created we hope to engage
 
02:30:31.790 --> 02:30:31.800 align:start position:0%
all of you over the coming year uh to
 
02:30:34.870 --> 02:30:34.880 align:start position:0%

eventually into its
 
02:30:42.750 --> 02:30:42.760 align:start position:0%
development um I do have copies of the
 
02:30:45.070 --> 02:30:45.080 align:start position:0%

each of those areas and it also provides
 
02:31:00.309 --> 02:31:00.319 align:start position:0%

determin we have 28 bills assigned to us
 
02:32:40.190 --> 02:32:40.200 align:start position:0%

02:32:41.269 --> 02:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
we're going to get off to a running
 
02:32:43.150 --> 02:32:43.160 align:start position:0%
start next week at again 9:30 on
 
02:32:45.150 --> 02:32:45.160 align:start position:0%
Wednesday look forward to seeing all of
 
02:32:48.269 --> 02:32:48.279 align:start position:0%
you then thank you representative
 
02:32:50.750 --> 02:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
Weber I just had one nuts and bolts
 
02:32:51.950 --> 02:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
thing that I wish had asked at the
 
02:32:53.950 --> 02:32:53.960 align:start position:0%
beginning of last session two years ago
 
02:32:57.070 --> 02:32:57.080 align:start position:0%
but I didn't uh we have now become kind
 
02:33:01.830 --> 02:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
of a traveling committee so do we still
 
02:33:06.070 --> 02:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
have somewhere an office that has filing
 
02:33:07.990 --> 02:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
cabinets where we can keep papers and
 
02:33:12.110 --> 02:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
things and if so which one is it I I
 
02:33:13.790 --> 02:33:13.800 align:start position:0%
have not been told otherwise so it
 
02:33:16.389 --> 02:33:16.399 align:start position:0%
should still be 205 okay so that's our
 
02:33:18.429 --> 02:33:18.439 align:start position:0%
our home base if that has been changed
 
02:33:20.309 --> 02:33:20.319 align:start position:0%
then no one told me so okay thank you
 
02:33:22.710 --> 02:33:22.720 align:start position:0%
very much so so for new members they
 
02:33:25.830 --> 02:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
should have a drawer in a filing cabinet
 
02:33:27.750 --> 02:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
that has their name on it so that they
 
02:33:30.950 --> 02:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
could actually I mean it it fit a pile
 
02:33:34.190 --> 02:33:34.200 align:start position:0%
of papers plus a pair of shoes so it's
 
02:33:36.070 --> 02:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
very useful to the best of my knowledge
 
02:33:37.750 --> 02:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
that should be the case yes
 
02:33:37.760 --> 02:33:40.030 align:start position:0%
that should be the case yes
representative

02:33:40.030 --> 02:33:40.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:33:43.590 --> 02:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
pazo I have a question uh maybe to the
 
02:33:47.910 --> 02:33:47.920 align:start position:0%
chair does our committee have any policy
 
02:33:50.269 --> 02:33:50.279 align:start position:0%
on lobbying from agent
 
02:33:54.309 --> 02:33:54.319 align:start position:0%
because for example when Karen
 
02:33:57.110 --> 02:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
Hebert was speaking about testifying
 
02:34:00.190 --> 02:34:00.200 align:start position:0%
here in future she told us that she will
 
02:34:01.990 --> 02:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
be giving us
 
02:34:05.870 --> 02:34:05.880 align:start position:0%
information but when another agency
 
02:34:10.710 --> 02:34:10.720 align:start position:0%
lead Ernie Gillan was uh speaking about
 
02:34:13.950 --> 02:34:13.960 align:start position:0%
what he will be presenting he made it
 
02:34:17.230 --> 02:34:17.240 align:start position:0%
clear that he will be advocating for for
 
02:34:17.240 --> 02:34:18.550 align:start position:0%
clear that he will be advocating for for
certain

02:34:18.550 --> 02:34:18.560 align:start position:0%
certain
 
02:34:22.670 --> 02:34:22.680 align:start position:0%
policies uh from the agency so as far as
 
02:34:24.309 --> 02:34:24.319 align:start position:0%
I understand some
 
02:34:27.230 --> 02:34:27.240 align:start position:0%
committees advise
 
02:34:31.309 --> 02:34:31.319 align:start position:0%
agencies uh just to give information uh
 
02:34:35.870 --> 02:34:35.880 align:start position:0%
and not taking positions so I wonder
 
02:34:41.309 --> 02:34:41.319 align:start position:0%
like is there any uh preference in this
 
02:34:44.590 --> 02:34:44.600 align:start position:0%
committee it's I don't know of any U
 
02:34:46.790 --> 02:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
restriction on an agency advocating for
 
02:34:49.950 --> 02:34:49.960 align:start position:0%
a certain position uh I know often times
 
02:34:51.550 --> 02:34:51.560 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services does not take
 
02:34:54.389 --> 02:34:54.399 align:start position:0%
a position on a bill they just provide
 
02:34:57.030 --> 02:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
information but on other occasions they
 
02:34:59.830 --> 02:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
they may offer opposition or support uh
 
02:35:02.950 --> 02:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
and that's up to really the agency on a
 
02:35:05.190 --> 02:35:05.200 align:start position:0%
case-by Case basis at least to the best
 
02:35:06.670 --> 02:35:06.680 align:start position:0%
of my knowledge representative Weber I
 
02:35:08.590 --> 02:35:08.600 align:start position:0%
don't know of anything different than
 
02:35:10.670 --> 02:35:10.680 align:start position:0%
that I would say that and I also would
 
02:35:13.389 --> 02:35:13.399 align:start position:0%
say that when I have subed on other
 
02:35:17.870 --> 02:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
committees I have been astonished at how
 
02:35:21.070 --> 02:35:21.080 align:start position:0%
very um care ful the Department of
 
02:35:25.910 --> 02:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services has been to be
 
02:35:29.710 --> 02:35:29.720 align:start position:0%
clear about what are legislative
 
02:35:32.469 --> 02:35:32.479 align:start position:0%
prerogatives and they they certainly I
 
02:35:34.030 --> 02:35:34.040 align:start position:0%
mean it seems fair to me that they can
 
02:35:34.040 --> 02:35:34.950 align:start position:0%
mean it seems fair to me that they can
have

02:35:34.950 --> 02:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:35:39.830 --> 02:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
positions uh and communicate them to us
 
02:35:41.790 --> 02:35:41.800 align:start position:0%
uh but they are also very clear that it
 
02:35:44.269 --> 02:35:44.279 align:start position:0%
is the legislature who makes the final
 
02:35:47.230 --> 02:35:47.240 align:start position:0%
decision on those and and I think that
 
02:35:49.670 --> 02:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
Mr Williams in particular has been very
 
02:35:53.830 --> 02:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
very careful uh to make that clear uh I
 
02:35:56.990 --> 02:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
have been in other committees in other
 
02:36:00.870 --> 02:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
years some time ago when an agency has
 
02:36:02.990 --> 02:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
simply said to a legislative panel well
 
02:36:06.150 --> 02:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
we're not going to agree to that and I I
 
02:36:09.590 --> 02:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
find that that's where it's Troublesome
 
02:36:11.309 --> 02:36:11.319 align:start position:0%
so thank
 
02:36:14.830 --> 02:36:14.840 align:start position:0%
you any other questions uh we will be
 
02:36:17.070 --> 02:36:17.080 align:start position:0%
meeting in and and it's my understanding
 
02:36:19.550 --> 02:36:19.560 align:start position:0%
this will be our assigned room for
 
02:36:21.190 --> 02:36:21.200 align:start position:0%
generally speaking for committee uh
 
02:36:24.070 --> 02:36:24.080 align:start position:0%
meetings room 201 we'll be sharing that
 
02:36:26.550 --> 02:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
with Public Works Public Works will be
 
02:36:28.550 --> 02:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
meeting on Tuesdays we will be meeting
 
02:36:31.550 --> 02:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
on Wednesdays and sometimes Thursdays as
 
02:36:33.830 --> 02:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
as we will be next week so and of course
 
02:36:35.389 --> 02:36:35.399 align:start position:0%
everything will be noticed in the
 
02:36:37.870 --> 02:36:37.880 align:start position:0%
calendar so unless anyone has anything
 
02:36:40.550 --> 02:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
else any other questions okay we stand
 
02:36:48.510 --> 02:36:48.520 align:start position:0%
