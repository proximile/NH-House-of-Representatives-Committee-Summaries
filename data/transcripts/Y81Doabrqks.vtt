these kinds of things but I think it's
all<00:16:45.199><c> going</c><00:16:45.399><c> to</c><00:16:45.600><c> even</c><00:16:45.920><c> out</c><00:16:46.160><c> in</c><00:16:46.319><c> the</c><00:16:46.480><c> wash</c><00:16:47.160><c> okay</c><00:16:47.360><c> I</c>

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:47.480 align:start position:0%
all going to even out in the wash okay I
 

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:49.910 align:start position:0%
all going to even out in the wash okay I
think<00:16:47.680><c> that</c><00:16:47.880><c> in</c><00:16:48.040><c> the</c><00:16:48.199><c> end</c><00:16:48.920><c> the</c><00:16:49.079><c> uniformity</c><00:16:49.800><c> of</c>

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
think that in the end the uniformity of
 

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:53.550 align:start position:0%
think that in the end the uniformity of

00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:55.720 align:start position:0%
and I think that anything that can that
 

00:16:55.720 --> 00:17:00.870 align:start position:0%
