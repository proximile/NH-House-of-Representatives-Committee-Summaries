1370 um which is if I should read the
 
00:11:49.509 --> 00:11:49.519 align:start position:0%
title relative to durable and
 
00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
tamperproof Bot uh containers for
 
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
preserving ballots uh I will recognize
 
00:11:59.389 --> 00:11:59.399 align:start position:0%
representative B for a motion I move all
 
00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
OTP is there a second all second
 
00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
representative Howard seconds is there
 
00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:09.680 align:start position:0%
discussion on the bill representative HR
 
00:12:12.949 --> 00:12:12.959 align:start position:0%
would like to speak thank you um
 
00:12:16.389 --> 00:12:16.399 align:start position:0%
speaking with my city clerk's
 
00:12:19.949 --> 00:12:19.959 align:start position:0%
office the first question is from him is
 
00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:22.600 align:start position:0%
why would this be necessary cardboard
 
00:12:26.629 --> 00:12:26.639 align:start position:0%
boxes are secured with tamper evident
 
00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
tape along with the seal signed by the
 
00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
ction officials accounting for the
 
00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:33.680 align:start position:0%
documents enclosed within so with these
 
00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:36.160 align:start position:0%
plastic boxes would they have the
 
00:12:40.509 --> 00:12:40.519 align:start position:0%
ability to have that seal on them also
 
00:12:43.509 --> 00:12:43.519 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that be gunking them up after a
 
00:12:46.509 --> 00:12:46.519 align:start position:0%
few times that they're
 
00:12:46.519 --> 00:12:48.509 align:start position:0%
few times that they're
used

00:12:48.509 --> 00:12:48.519 align:start position:0%
used
 
00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:51.880 align:start position:0%
um let the let the representative finish
 
00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:55.160 align:start position:0%
speaking obviously you know we store the
 
00:12:57.829 --> 00:12:57.839 align:start position:0%
cardboard boxes
 
00:12:57.839 --> 00:12:59.509 align:start position:0%
cardboard boxes
unopened

00:12:59.509 --> 00:12:59.519 align:start position:0%
unopened
 
00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:03.880 align:start position:0%
and this would be a lot of room needed
 
00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:06.920 align:start position:0%
for these plastic bins
 
00:13:09.629 --> 00:13:09.639 align:start position:0%
containers um maybe they are prettier
 
00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:12.360 align:start position:0%
but after a while they're going to get
 
00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:15.800 align:start position:0%
ugly looking I think and we have 12
 
00:13:17.269 --> 00:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
Wards in
 
00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
Manchester I work the elections I know
 
00:13:24.949 --> 00:13:24.959 align:start position:0%
how to package up a box and they don't
 
00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:27.560 align:start position:0%
they're used over and over again we open
 
00:13:30.269 --> 00:13:30.279 align:start position:0%
them during the day take ballots out and
 
00:13:32.629 --> 00:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
then when they're cleaned out we put the
 
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
ballots in so they do have tape on them
 
00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.430 align:start position:0%
ballots in so they do have tape on them
but

00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:38.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:13:41.829 --> 00:13:41.839 align:start position:0%
um when we when the election is done we
 
00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
have to pack them in a car
 
00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
our 6,000 ballots going to fit into
 
00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:53.240 align:start position:0%
boxes easy to travel over to our city
 
00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
clerk's office to drop them off in these
 
00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
containers I just I'm just worried about
 
00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:02.360 align:start position:0%
this okay further discussion on the I'm
 
00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:04.160 align:start position:0%
sorry representative I apologize
 
00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
representative B is recognized yeah I
 
00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:08.240 align:start position:0%
would like to answer some of the
 
00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
questions I think the Box the plastic
 
00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
one should be about the same size as the
 
00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
boxes also as the Secretary State said
 
00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
they'll be using a wire seal so don't
 
00:14:23.189 --> 00:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
need the tape other than taping the
 
00:14:27.069 --> 00:14:27.079 align:start position:0%
affidavit saying that they were suck so
 
00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
I don't think it'd be that much more
 
00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:32.120 align:start position:0%
room uh CU probably hopefully they'll
 
00:14:33.949 --> 00:14:33.959 align:start position:0%
going to go for the same size of the
 
00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
boxes and they'll last longer I mean
 
00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
cardboard boxes don't last okay further
 
00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:40.680 align:start position:0%
discussion on the bill representative
 
00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:43.880 align:start position:0%
Hamlet you recognized thank you Mr chair
 
00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:47.320 align:start position:0%
so I'm concerned because it seems like
 
00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
we'd be using a whole lot of plastic
 
00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
which is not good for the environment
 
00:14:54.949 --> 00:14:54.959 align:start position:0%
the cardboard boxes are made basically
 
00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
made out of paper they're recyclable I
 
00:14:57.990 --> 00:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
don't think they're as bad for the
 
00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
environment and when they're taped up
 
00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:02.920 align:start position:0%
correctly with with the red you know
 
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
plastic tape that I think they're very
 
00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
secure um yes they can get wet and can
 
00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
get beaten up but I don't think there's
 
00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:16.040 align:start position:0%
any there was no testimony given about
 
00:15:19.269 --> 00:15:19.279 align:start position:0%
any ballots ever being
 
00:15:23.269 --> 00:15:23.279 align:start position:0%
ruined so I think they're so I I think
 
00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
the cardboard boxes are fine and they're
 
00:15:27.949 --> 00:15:27.959 align:start position:0%
better for the environment thank you
 
00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
representative how
 
00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you Mr chair uh when
 
00:15:33.389 --> 00:15:33.399 align:start position:0%
we're looking at the potential
 
00:15:36.189 --> 00:15:36.199 align:start position:0%
destruction of ballots uh from potential
 
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:39.240 align:start position:0%
things like water damage I mean if we
 
00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:41.440 align:start position:0%
end up losing those ballots then there's
 
00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:43.880 align:start position:0%
no recourse that we can have to get
 
00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:45.880 align:start position:0%
those back so we shouldn't be
 
00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
necessarily risking uh something that
 
00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
may be a one-off event uh if we can have
 
00:15:55.309 --> 00:15:55.319 align:start position:0%
something that's reusable fairly cheap
 
00:15:58.350 --> 00:15:58.360 align:start position:0%
uh and adds additional security thank
 
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
you further discussion seeing none I
 
00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
apologize representative P O'Brien you I
 
00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:07.720 align:start position:0%
just wanted to add about the uh tape I
 
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
that's a concern as well I can see what
 
00:16:14.829 --> 00:16:14.839 align:start position:0%
representative hr's um uh other election
 
00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:17.160 align:start position:0%
workers were concerned about who was it
 
00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:19.240 align:start position:0%
that that was the clerk yeah the clerk
 
00:16:22.949 --> 00:16:22.959 align:start position:0%
in Manchester but the the electronic
 
00:16:25.389 --> 00:16:25.399 align:start position:0%
ballot counting machines are currently
 
00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
sealed with the same kind of why
 
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
that um that representative bone was
 
00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:35.800 align:start position:0%
talking about so there is that security
 
00:16:38.189 --> 00:16:38.199 align:start position:0%
I had some questions about everything as
 
00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
well that we can make the cardboard
 
00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:43.720 align:start position:0%
boxes the same size as the ballots um
 
00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
these kinds of things but I think it's
 
00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:47.480 align:start position:0%
all going to even out in the wash okay I
 
00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
think that in the end the uniformity of
 
00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:53.560 align:start position:0%
the plastic ballots will will be fine
 
00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:55.720 align:start position:0%
and I think that anything that can that
 
00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
will um that will help with with the
 
00:17:02.629 --> 00:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
perception that we're doing things that
 
00:17:05.949 --> 00:17:05.959 align:start position:0%
in a much um more secure way fine let
 
00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's worth it let's do it okay
 
00:17:10.669 --> 00:17:10.679 align:start position:0%
further discussions seeing
 
00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:13.079 align:start position:0%
none okay representative wood yeah I
 
00:17:15.189 --> 00:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
didn't see you okay thank you thank you
 
00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:18.280 align:start position:0%
m Mr chair um the when it comes to the
 
00:17:19.909 --> 00:17:19.919 align:start position:0%
plastic containers we have to look at
 
00:17:22.789 --> 00:17:22.799 align:start position:0%
the whole chain of events there's a
 
00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:25.160 align:start position:0%
custody issues every time that box is
 
00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:27.480 align:start position:0%
open and we know that these boxes get
 
00:17:29.669 --> 00:17:29.679 align:start position:0%
open for multiple reasons recounts and
 
00:17:32.669 --> 00:17:32.679 align:start position:0%
that type of thing the plastic security
 
00:17:35.669 --> 00:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
is pretty standardly used in information
 
00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:37.400 align:start position:0%
that needs to be preserve every time
 
00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:39.080 align:start position:0%
that box is open there's a chain of
 
00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:41.480 align:start position:0%
custody that needs to be filled out so
 
00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
what happens is when you see any of the
 
00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:46.760 align:start position:0%
results of these Audits and the
 
00:17:49.029 --> 00:17:49.039 align:start position:0%
information that's brought to us you'll
 
00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:52.840 align:start position:0%
see the tape is uh they use special
 
00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
security tape they say void on it which
 
00:17:57.630 --> 00:17:57.640 align:start position:0%
means whatever that seal is it isn't
 
00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:01.080 align:start position:0%
accurate or holding to procedure there's
 
00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
containers that can't stand up to the
 
00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
weight of being stack which is a
 
00:18:08.149 --> 00:18:08.159 align:start position:0%
security issue the the the I think if
 
00:18:09.789 --> 00:18:09.799 align:start position:0%
you just put them in a box and never
 
00:18:11.909 --> 00:18:11.919 align:start position:0%
touch them again I think the point is
 
00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
there but these boxes have to be
 
00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
designed to to be part of that chain of
 
00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:20.280 align:start position:0%
custody uh uh and they can be opened up
 
00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
multiple times uh by the people on the
 
00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
list and every time they're open they
 
00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
got to be signed off and every time they
 
00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
returned they need to be seated
 
00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
so if they get open three times we know
 
00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:32.360 align:start position:0%
they were open three times by three
 
00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:34.840 align:start position:0%
different individuals
 
00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:37.000 align:start position:0%
so okay uh I'm going to go ahe and call
 
00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:40.240 align:start position:0%
the vote um and uh the clerk will call
 
00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:44.870 align:start position:0%
the vote um and uh the clerk will call
the

00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:48.440 align:start position:0%
