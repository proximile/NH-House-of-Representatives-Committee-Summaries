if you recall during the public hearing
 
00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:36.830 align:start position:0%
if you recall during the public hearing
the

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:22:39.049 --> 00:22:39.059 align:start position:0%
um Prime sponsor's intent of the bill
 
00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:41.820 align:start position:0%
was to have compiled a list of Monument
 
00:22:44.029 --> 00:22:44.039 align:start position:0%
historical resources and monuments in
 
00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
and he initially uh delegated that
 
00:22:51.169 --> 00:22:51.179 align:start position:0%
responsibility to
 
00:22:51.179 --> 00:22:52.370 align:start position:0%
responsibility to
um

00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:52.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:54.970 --> 00:22:54.980 align:start position:0%
the archives and Records management
 
00:22:58.730 --> 00:22:58.740 align:start position:0%
department but after further discussion
 
00:22:58.740 --> 00:22:59.990 align:start position:0%
department but after further discussion
with

00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:23:02.289 --> 00:23:02.299 align:start position:0%
um the division of historical resources
 
00:23:04.909 --> 00:23:04.919 align:start position:0%
that's a much more appropriate place for
 
00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:06.900 align:start position:0%
it that also would not have a fiscal
 
00:23:09.409 --> 00:23:09.419 align:start position:0%
note they could easily absorb that
 
00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:12.780 align:start position:0%
responsibility as the Director mentioned
 
00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
during the public hearing or I think
 
00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
maybe it was in a letter we received so
 
00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:21.780 align:start position:0%
um aligns the responsibility of
 
00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
compiling that record to the appropriate
 
00:23:27.409 --> 00:23:27.419 align:start position:0%
agency without any additional cost so
 
00:23:30.049 --> 00:23:30.059 align:start position:0%
that's why I I support and bring forth
 
00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:33.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:40.500 align:start position:0%

00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
I believe the bill needs to be retained
 
00:27:33.409 --> 00:27:33.419 align:start position:0%
in order to discuss some important
 
00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:36.120 align:start position:0%
things relative to the builds remember
 
00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
we did not get any testimony
 
00:27:43.789 --> 00:27:43.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:46.380 align:start position:0%
from Mr from
 
00:27:48.649 --> 00:27:48.659 align:start position:0%
Mr Wilson
 
00:27:53.269 --> 00:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
uh who was Sue he sent a letter but
 
00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
there was little there were questions
 
00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
and that in my mind that I would I need
 
00:27:59.930 --> 00:27:59.940 align:start position:0%
answered before I will I would vote for
 
00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
this uh he said it's there's something
 
00:28:06.049 --> 00:28:06.059 align:start position:0%
about once this being uh
 
00:28:06.059 --> 00:28:07.850 align:start position:0%
about once this being uh
uh

00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:07.860 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:28:13.549 --> 00:28:13.559 align:start position:0%
this bill the this once every 10 years
 
00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:17.100 align:start position:0%
does he get the uh his department has to
 
00:28:21.049 --> 00:28:21.059 align:start position:0%
do that uh has to do this survey
 
00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:23.100 align:start position:0%
there's no estimate of the time of work
 
00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:26.580 align:start position:0%
because he started uh when does he start
 
00:28:28.549 --> 00:28:28.559 align:start position:0%
when does the 10 years start and when
 
00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:31.380 align:start position:0%
does it end does it end right after the
 
00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
there's a start right after the 10-year
 
00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:36.360 align:start position:0%
ends as he started Acworth and go to uh
 
00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
uh go to Windsor or go to will win them
 
00:28:45.730 --> 00:28:45.740 align:start position:0%
uh what's the scope of this bill
 
00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:50.220 align:start position:0%
uh how how many monuments or markers are
 
00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh I was going to have to have to is he
 
00:28:55.669 --> 00:28:55.679 align:start position:0%
going to have to look at
 
00:28:58.669 --> 00:28:58.679 align:start position:0%
I have no clue do you
 
00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:02.460 align:start position:0%
uh this uh is it just monuments and
 
00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:05.700 align:start position:0%
markers about cannons there's a lot of
 
00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:07.320 align:start position:0%
cannons in town
 
00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
and my my town has uh has at least two
 
00:29:13.789 --> 00:29:13.799 align:start position:0%
or I know Nashville has at least four
 
00:29:17.029 --> 00:29:17.039 align:start position:0%
uh Concord has more cannons than the
 
00:29:21.169 --> 00:29:21.179 align:start position:0%
uh then well we won't say that uh any uh
 
00:29:24.409 --> 00:29:24.419 align:start position:0%
the other how is the involvement with
 
00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:25.740 align:start position:0%
the locals
 
00:29:27.649 --> 00:29:27.659 align:start position:0%
the local people what if the locals say
 
00:29:30.529 --> 00:29:30.539 align:start position:0%
we don't want you here get out of here
 
00:29:30.539 --> 00:29:33.230 align:start position:0%
we don't want you here get out of here
uh

00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:33.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:37.260 align:start position:0%
what there's there's just too many
 
00:29:40.789 --> 00:29:40.799 align:start position:0%
uh questions unanswered and we really do
 
00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:45.240 align:start position:0%
need to hear from the the
 
00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:47.640 align:start position:0%
the division that's going to be doing
 
00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:50.340 align:start position:0%
the work and how he's he's scheduling it
 
00:29:56.409 --> 00:29:56.419 align:start position:0%
uh this bill is a uh is a
 
00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh an early bill it may not be an early
 
00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
bill but he says it's not going to
 
00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
because he says it's uh that he's going
 
00:30:07.549 --> 00:30:07.559 align:start position:0%
to do it
 
00:30:09.889 --> 00:30:09.899 align:start position:0%
for uh for no money
 
00:30:12.169 --> 00:30:12.179 align:start position:0%
or no additional money
 
00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:15.240 align:start position:0%
that's not our that's not our call I
 
00:30:17.029 --> 00:30:17.039 align:start position:0%
think there's real we really need to
 
00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
spend the time
 
00:30:24.409 --> 00:30:24.419 align:start position:0%
uh so to to listen to see this to
 
00:30:28.010 --> 00:30:28.020 align:start position:0%
to discuss this bill and to re to retain
 
00:30:32.149 --> 00:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
it and then pass it at a later date
 
00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
after retention
 
00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
other than that I I will be voting no
 
00:30:41.269 --> 00:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
and if the if the no
 
00:30:43.130 --> 00:30:43.140 align:start position:0%
uh if
 
00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:46.500 align:start position:0%
you'd be if the motion to retain fails
 
00:30:49.850 --> 00:30:49.860 align:start position:0%
then I will ask for a motion
 
00:30:52.010 --> 00:30:52.020 align:start position:0%
to Ideal
 
00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:53.810 align:start position:0%
to Ideal
yes

00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:53.820 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:30:57.169 --> 00:30:57.179 align:start position:0%
Mr chair yes I could probably ask the
 
00:30:59.510 --> 00:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
clerk this question but in my notes Mr
 
00:31:02.450 --> 00:31:02.460 align:start position:0%
Wilson did testify at the public hearing
 
00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
and he did support it and he said it
 
00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:07.320 align:start position:0%
would be a very easy task for his uh
 
00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
division to assume no he sent a letter
 
00:31:14.269 --> 00:31:14.279 align:start position:0%
and I read the letter
 
00:31:16.370 --> 00:31:16.380 align:start position:0%
oh okay you read the letter into the
 
00:31:19.570 --> 00:31:19.580 align:start position:0%
record yes okay thank you
 
00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:22.200 align:start position:0%
representative wolf thank you Mr
 
00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:23.450 align:start position:0%
representative wolf thank you Mr
chairman

00:31:23.450 --> 00:31:23.460 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:24.230 align:start position:0%
chairman
um

00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:27.769 --> 00:31:27.779 align:start position:0%
I think this is just too broad it
 
00:31:30.769 --> 00:31:30.779 align:start position:0%
includes physical markers of a
 
00:31:33.409 --> 00:31:33.419 align:start position:0%
historical event or geographical sites
 
00:31:37.450 --> 00:31:37.460 align:start position:0%
of historical or cultural significance
 
00:31:39.889 --> 00:31:39.899 align:start position:0%
what is that if there's a piece of land
 
00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
outside a meeting house that somebody
 
00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:44.940 align:start position:0%
walks through we have to inventory that
 
00:31:48.769 --> 00:31:48.779 align:start position:0%
there's it's just so broad here anything
 
00:31:51.529 --> 00:31:51.539 align:start position:0%
of a physical marker or a historical
 
00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:54.360 align:start position:0%
event of individuals or geographical
 
00:31:58.730 --> 00:31:58.740 align:start position:0%
sites I think it's much too broad I
 
00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
I'll go along with retaining but I think
 
00:32:04.370 --> 00:32:04.380 align:start position:0%
that there's just too much in here that
 
00:32:06.769 --> 00:32:06.779 align:start position:0%
somebody will be out there from day one
 
00:32:08.810 --> 00:32:08.820 align:start position:0%
for the next 10 years
 
00:32:10.970 --> 00:32:10.980 align:start position:0%
recording things and starting all over
 
00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:12.230 align:start position:0%
recording things and starting all over
again

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:32:15.769 --> 00:32:15.779 align:start position:0%
so I I'm opposed to the bill
 
00:32:17.930 --> 00:32:17.940 align:start position:0%
but we'll accept retention if that's the
 
00:32:22.250 --> 00:32:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
representative Vale
 
00:32:27.289 --> 00:32:27.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:27.299 --> 00:32:28.190 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:28.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:30.740 align:start position:0%
now during the hearing we did hear from
 
00:32:33.169 --> 00:32:33.179 align:start position:0%
several of the representatives
 
00:32:35.029 --> 00:32:35.039 align:start position:0%
um and where we're talking here about
 
00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:38.700 align:start position:0%
the division of historical resources
 
00:32:40.669 --> 00:32:40.679 align:start position:0%
don't they have rulemaking authority
 
00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:43.500 align:start position:0%
about how these
 
00:32:47.149 --> 00:32:47.159 align:start position:0%
would be inventoried and
 
00:32:49.610 --> 00:32:49.620 align:start position:0%
how often that they would keep this up
 
00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:50.820 align:start position:0%
to date
 
00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
what I what I see here is that well what
 
00:32:56.090 --> 00:32:56.100 align:start position:0%
I see in my own town is that we we work
 
00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:57.110 align:start position:0%
I see in my own town is that we we work
on

00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:58.310 align:start position:0%
on
um

00:32:58.310 --> 00:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:00.529 --> 00:33:00.539 align:start position:0%
our historical resources but we don't
 
00:33:02.570 --> 00:33:02.580 align:start position:0%
necessarily have a government body
 
00:33:06.289 --> 00:33:06.299 align:start position:0%
overlooking overseeing that and I'm not
 
00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
sure that some of the concerns with this
 
00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
bill actually belong in statute where we
 
00:33:13.490 --> 00:33:13.500 align:start position:0%
know that the division of historical
 
00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:15.240 align:start position:0%
Resources Director has a rule making
 
00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:16.549 align:start position:0%
Resources Director has a rule making
Authority

00:33:16.549 --> 00:33:16.559 align:start position:0%
Authority
 
00:33:18.769 --> 00:33:18.779 align:start position:0%
if that is the case and so I would be
 
00:33:22.669 --> 00:33:22.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:25.500 align:start position:0%
or any other
 
00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:28.500 align:start position:0%
is there any other uh anyone else who
 
00:33:31.930 --> 00:33:31.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:35.149 --> 00:33:35.159 align:start position:0%
Darby thank you uh Mr chair now I just
 
00:33:36.889 --> 00:33:36.899 align:start position:0%
would like to point out um from the
 
00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
amendment that um it does say work with
 
00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:42.720 align:start position:0%
local communities so
 
00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:46.440 align:start position:0%
um as I I read the bill it's not that
 
00:33:48.970 --> 00:33:48.980 align:start position:0%
the um the
 
00:33:51.049 --> 00:33:51.059 align:start position:0%
division of historical resources
 
00:33:52.990 --> 00:33:53.000 align:start position:0%
believes that they have to individually
 
00:33:56.810 --> 00:33:56.820 align:start position:0%
account for each Monument independently
 
00:33:59.029 --> 00:33:59.039 align:start position:0%
but they'll work with the local
 
00:33:59.039 --> 00:34:00.590 align:start position:0%
but they'll work with the local
resources

00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
resources
 
00:34:01.909 --> 00:34:01.919 align:start position:0%
um you know the local communities in
 
00:34:04.909 --> 00:34:04.919 align:start position:0%
particular to inventory those
 
00:34:04.919 --> 00:34:07.190 align:start position:0%
particular to inventory those
um

00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:09.950 --> 00:34:09.960 align:start position:0%
therefore I
 
00:34:13.669 --> 00:34:13.679 align:start position:0%
I I think it is clear in terms of uh the
 
00:34:15.829 --> 00:34:15.839 align:start position:0%
scope that's being collected
 
00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:17.399 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:34:20.089 --> 00:34:20.099 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak for a first
 
00:34:20.099 --> 00:34:22.909 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak for a first
time

00:34:22.909 --> 00:34:22.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:25.970 --> 00:34:25.980 align:start position:0%
seeing none for a second time
 
00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:27.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:34:29.990 --> 00:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
I did want to mention also that there's
 
00:34:33.829 --> 00:34:33.839 align:start position:0%
really no fiscal impact involved with
 
00:34:35.450 --> 00:34:35.460 align:start position:0%
this bill so although has a financial
 
00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:37.080 align:start position:0%
note it doesn't
 
00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:39.540 align:start position:0%
really need financing and that's
 
00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:41.399 align:start position:0%
something that we'll be commenting on as
 
00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
we send it along
 
00:34:45.409 --> 00:34:45.419 align:start position:0%
um and that's all I had to say for now
 
00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:50.580 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else versus to speak
 
00:34:53.210 --> 00:34:53.220 align:start position:0%
for a second time thank you just just
 
00:34:53.220 --> 00:34:54.770 align:start position:0%

representative Dale

would you like to speak um
 
00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
on your motion thank you Mr chair just
 
00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
very briefly uh I'm not against the
 
00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:16.140 align:start position:0%
concept of uh our people knowing where
 
00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:17.940 align:start position:0%
it is but for some of the reasons
 
00:37:20.210 --> 00:37:20.220 align:start position:0%
mentioned I think this bill can be made
 
00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
better and I'd like to retain it so that
 
00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
we can work on it thank you
 
00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
you like to speak on your second thank
 
00:37:30.349 --> 00:37:30.359 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair
 
00:37:32.089 --> 00:37:32.099 align:start position:0%
I think it's I think at this point
 
00:37:34.490 --> 00:37:34.500 align:start position:0%
because we it's we have 10 to 10 that
 
00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
retaining it is is a good idea
 
00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:37.800 align:start position:0%
especially if not everyone is
 
00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:40.200 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the language
 
00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:42.720 align:start position:0%
when I look at the language and and on
 
00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
the amendment with Part B on line 14 it
 
00:37:49.210 --> 00:37:49.220 align:start position:0%
says once every 10 years the director
 
00:37:52.970 --> 00:37:52.980 align:start position:0%
shall work with local communities and
 
00:37:55.970 --> 00:37:55.980 align:start position:0%
what I understand in my own town and may
 
00:37:58.190 --> 00:37:58.200 align:start position:0%
not be an example of every town is that
 
00:38:00.290 --> 00:38:00.300 align:start position:0%
people are keeping an inventory of
 
00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:03.240 align:start position:0%
what's going on ongoingly and I see this
 
00:38:06.010 --> 00:38:06.020 align:start position:0%
as more of something of a Reconciliation
 
00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
I think that a lot of these monuments
 
00:38:11.690 --> 00:38:11.700 align:start position:0%
and places of historical significance in
 
00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:13.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire already are recorded and
 
00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:16.440 align:start position:0%
they're being they are
 
00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
um being taken care of so I do think
 
00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
that we should retain it and make
 
00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:22.020 align:start position:0%
everyone comfortable with the language
 
00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:27.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:29.640 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to speak
 
00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:35.640 align:start position:0%
the motion to retain
 
00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:41.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
would that be retaining the motion as
 
00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:46.310 align:start position:0%
would that be retaining the motion as
amended

of discussions with the HB 737 pfas
Commission

00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:10.020 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
00:41:12.349 --> 00:41:12.359 align:start position:0%
what we did was there were three
 
00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
recommendations made in our annual
 
00:41:17.089 --> 00:41:17.099 align:start position:0%
report to the governor and Senate
 
00:41:19.730 --> 00:41:19.740 align:start position:0%
President and speaker of the house after
 
00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
discussions with Des we bundled those
 
00:41:26.569 --> 00:41:26.579 align:start position:0%
recommendations into house bill 212 and
 
00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
worked with Des on the language to make
 
00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
sure that it was technically accurate
 
00:41:34.370 --> 00:41:34.380 align:start position:0%
and and that it meant the intent of the
 
00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
commission what this bill does is it
 
00:41:41.329 --> 00:41:41.339 align:start position:0%
adds some money into an existing pfas
 
00:41:45.170 --> 00:41:45.180 align:start position:0%
remediation fund allowing that fund to
 
00:41:47.770 --> 00:41:47.780 align:start position:0%
assume broader
 
00:41:50.810 --> 00:41:50.820 align:start position:0%
to address broader issues such as the
 
00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
increased need for testing scientific
 
00:41:56.569 --> 00:41:56.579 align:start position:0%
investigation and any moderation that
 
00:41:59.329 --> 00:41:59.339 align:start position:0%
needs to occur if and when the EPA
 
00:42:01.609 --> 00:42:01.619 align:start position:0%
issues maximum contaminant levels for
 
00:42:04.730 --> 00:42:04.740 align:start position:0%
pfas at the federal level
 
00:42:07.550 --> 00:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
um as such the the name of that fund has
 
00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
been changed in this bill to pfas
 
00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
response fund
 
00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:15.060 align:start position:0%
um we all know that pfas is a major
 
00:42:17.150 --> 00:42:17.160 align:start position:0%
issue in Southern New Hampshire and In
 
00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
Pockets of other states and we need to
 
00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:23.640 align:start position:0%
ensure that our Environmental Services
 
00:42:26.329 --> 00:42:26.339 align:start position:0%
department is well equipped and
 
00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
resourced in order to address those
 
00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:35.690 --> 00:42:35.700 align:start position:0%
you wish to speak to your second
 
00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:37.980 align:start position:0%

00:42:39.770 --> 00:42:39.780 align:start position:0%
is going to help a lot of people is a
 
00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
good thing and I think we should
 
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.349 align:start position:0%
good thing and I think we should
OTP

00:42:45.349 --> 00:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:49.730 --> 00:42:49.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
but perhaps representative Vale
 
00:42:56.210 --> 00:42:56.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:42:58.970 --> 00:42:58.980 align:start position:0%
when we met earlier on this bill
 
00:43:01.849 --> 00:43:01.859 align:start position:0%
um we just wanted to be
 
00:43:03.530 --> 00:43:03.540 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that we spoke about
 
00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
was that um there's concerns over the
 
00:43:08.089 --> 00:43:08.099 align:start position:0%
testing costs
 
00:43:10.849 --> 00:43:10.859 align:start position:0%
but when we discussed that we were able
 
00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
to just the priority of the bill is so

second
 
00:46:13.309 --> 00:46:13.319 align:start position:0%
by representative Horgan we used to
 
00:46:16.550 --> 00:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
speak to your uh oh sure thank you Mr
 
00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:17.750 align:start position:0%
speak to your uh oh sure thank you Mr
chair

00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:46:21.349 --> 00:46:21.359 align:start position:0%
um as was noted uh the Des uh as a
 
00:46:23.569 --> 00:46:23.579 align:start position:0%
result of a bill last year is working on
 
00:46:26.829 --> 00:46:26.839 align:start position:0%
an extensive plan concerning
 
00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria mitigation and we expect
 
00:46:31.790 --> 00:46:31.800 align:start position:0%
that plan will be coming out this
 
00:46:35.150 --> 00:46:35.160 align:start position:0%
November so I'd like to retain this bill
 
00:46:37.550 --> 00:46:37.560 align:start position:0%
and then we'll have that plan and we can
 
00:46:39.410 --> 00:46:39.420 align:start position:0%
review it and make the appropriate
 
00:46:42.650 --> 00:46:42.660 align:start position:0%
changes if necessary to the proposed
 
00:46:48.370 --> 00:46:48.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
representative Horgan you wish to speak
 
00:46:51.589 --> 00:46:51.599 align:start position:0%
to your second
 
00:46:53.450 --> 00:46:53.460 align:start position:0%
no additional comments thank you Mr
 
00:46:53.460 --> 00:46:54.950 align:start position:0%
no additional comments thank you Mr
chairman

00:46:54.950 --> 00:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:46:57.050 --> 00:46:57.060 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else wish to speak to
 
00:46:58.730 --> 00:46:58.740 align:start position:0%
the bill of kings of the motion
 
00:47:02.150 --> 00:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
representative rock thank you Mr chair I
 
00:47:05.930 --> 00:47:05.940 align:start position:0%
strongly oppose the motion to retain uh
 
00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
for several reasons one is that
 
00:47:11.930 --> 00:47:11.940 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria is an extremely serious
 
00:47:14.329 --> 00:47:14.339 align:start position:0%
issue in New Hampshire it gets worse
 
00:47:16.970 --> 00:47:16.980 align:start position:0%
every year we don't do anything this
 
00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
money would cover existing projects that
 
00:47:21.890 --> 00:47:21.900 align:start position:0%
have been identified but that don't have
 
00:47:24.530 --> 00:47:24.540 align:start position:0%
funding that have already been prepared
 
00:47:27.109 --> 00:47:27.119 align:start position:0%
through EPA approved watershed
 
00:47:28.990 --> 00:47:29.000 align:start position:0%
management plans
 
00:47:33.050 --> 00:47:33.060 align:start position:0%
also by retaining it we lose the ability
 
00:47:35.210 --> 00:47:35.220 align:start position:0%
of securing the funding in the second
 
00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
year so essentially retaining it is
 
00:47:38.349 --> 00:47:38.359 align:start position:0%
killing it
 
00:47:41.890 --> 00:47:41.900 align:start position:0%
Des is
 
00:47:44.510 --> 00:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
you know they spoke to this they said
 
00:47:47.150 --> 00:47:47.160 align:start position:0%
it's a worthwhile if you read the
 
00:47:48.589 --> 00:47:48.599 align:start position:0%
commissioner's letter it's a very
 
00:47:51.650 --> 00:47:51.660 align:start position:0%
worthwhile bill you will see that I've
 
00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
passed around I have an amendment which
 
00:47:56.210 --> 00:47:56.220 align:start position:0%
if the retained most fails I would like
 
00:47:57.530 --> 00:47:57.540 align:start position:0%
to speak to the amendment which
 
00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
addresses a lot of the issues that were
 
00:48:02.030 --> 00:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
brought up during the public hearing not
 
00:48:03.410 --> 00:48:03.420 align:start position:0%
that there were many there were very
 
00:48:06.349 --> 00:48:06.359 align:start position:0%
very few if I have the ability of the
 
00:48:08.750 --> 00:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
retained motion fails there there is
 
00:48:10.370 --> 00:48:10.380 align:start position:0%
people there are people here from Des
 
00:48:13.849 --> 00:48:13.859 align:start position:0%
who would be willing to speak to this
 
00:48:19.430 --> 00:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:29.710 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:48:29.710 --> 00:48:29.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
I also rise in part of the bill
 
00:48:38.690 --> 00:48:38.700 align:start position:0%
um and the motion to ought to pass I
 
00:48:41.569 --> 00:48:41.579 align:start position:0%
with as amended I am
 
00:48:43.370 --> 00:48:43.380 align:start position:0%
really think this is a serious problem
 
00:48:45.170 --> 00:48:45.180 align:start position:0%
and we've been told that this will cost
 
00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
billions of dollars and it affects our
 
00:48:49.790 --> 00:48:49.800 align:start position:0%
Lakes Region it is really important for
 
00:48:51.470 --> 00:48:51.480 align:start position:0%
us to protect the environment and to
 
00:48:54.290 --> 00:48:54.300 align:start position:0%
protect the species that we're trying to
 
00:48:57.470 --> 00:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
return to the lake such as loons when we
 
00:48:59.270 --> 00:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
go through almost all of these bills
 
00:49:01.670 --> 00:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
that we've done so far this year it is
 
00:49:03.650 --> 00:49:03.660 align:start position:0%
really clear to me that cyanobacteria
 
00:49:07.010 --> 00:49:07.020 align:start position:0%
can make most of our work Moot and it
 
00:49:09.849 --> 00:49:09.859 align:start position:0%
will make it very much harder to
 
00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
sustain the Lakes Region and the
 
00:49:17.089 --> 00:49:17.099 align:start position:0%
recreation we had testimony that um like
 
00:49:18.589 --> 00:49:18.599 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong but on late
 
00:49:21.230 --> 00:49:21.240 align:start position:0%
kanasaka they had a lot of areas that
 
00:49:22.609 --> 00:49:22.619 align:start position:0%
where people could not use the water
 
00:49:25.970 --> 00:49:25.980 align:start position:0%
because the cyanobacterias can cause the
 
00:49:27.890 --> 00:49:27.900 align:start position:0%
toxins it's not the bacteria but when
 
00:49:30.109 --> 00:49:30.119 align:start position:0%
when the bacteria eat they eat
 
00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
phosphorus they eat things that are in
 
00:49:34.069 --> 00:49:34.079 align:start position:0%
the water and this is their excrement
 
00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
that is poisoning people so I want
 
00:49:37.370 --> 00:49:37.380 align:start position:0%
people to think about this on a
 
00:49:40.250 --> 00:49:40.260 align:start position:0%
biological level you are swimming in a
 
00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
lake that has neurotoxins that can hurt
 
00:49:46.370 --> 00:49:46.380 align:start position:0%
you and this is not a lot this probably
 
00:49:49.849 --> 00:49:49.859 align:start position:0%
strike down for this this is 25 million
 
00:49:53.450 --> 00:49:53.460 align:start position:0%
dollars and when the bill gets on to
 
00:49:55.490 --> 00:49:55.500 align:start position:0%
finance I think they will figure the
 
00:49:57.589 --> 00:49:57.599 align:start position:0%
priorities but while we're here on the
 
00:49:59.329 --> 00:49:59.339 align:start position:0%
policy I believe that we need to pass
 
00:50:00.290 --> 00:50:00.300 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:50:06.890 --> 00:50:06.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:09.290 --> 00:50:09.300 align:start position:0%
representative McHugh
 
00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:50:12.950 --> 00:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
and I just thank the sponsors for
 
00:50:14.150 --> 00:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
bringing out this important issue I
 
00:50:15.589 --> 00:50:15.599 align:start position:0%
think we we're the committee's in
 
00:50:17.390 --> 00:50:17.400 align:start position:0%
agreement that it's an important issue
 
00:50:18.890 --> 00:50:18.900 align:start position:0%
we've got to get it right again
 
00:50:20.329 --> 00:50:20.339 align:start position:0%
representative ring and I agree that
 
00:50:22.970 --> 00:50:22.980 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a critical issue for the
 
00:50:24.050 --> 00:50:24.060 align:start position:0%
state to
 
00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
get something done on cyanobacteria
 
00:50:29.450 --> 00:50:29.460 align:start position:0%
even the commissioner says the bill has
 
00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
some problems in fact they didn't come
 
00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
out and support in fact they took no
 
00:50:37.370 --> 00:50:37.380 align:start position:0%
position on it he says it right in his
 
00:50:38.990 --> 00:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
testimony that the commission the
 
00:50:40.609 --> 00:50:40.619 align:start position:0%
commissioner takes no position on this
 
00:50:40.619 --> 00:50:41.750 align:start position:0%
commissioner takes no position on this
bill

00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
he states that there are some items that
 
00:50:47.210 --> 00:50:47.220 align:start position:0%
are I quote could be problematic uh and
 
00:50:48.770 --> 00:50:48.780 align:start position:0%
he says that one item that could be
 
00:50:50.990 --> 00:50:51.000 align:start position:0%
problematic is the focus on loans and
 
00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
that it's unlikely a Lake Association or
 
00:50:55.370 --> 00:50:55.380 align:start position:0%
a watershed group could be in a position
 
00:50:57.170 --> 00:50:57.180 align:start position:0%
to take on debt
 
00:50:58.490 --> 00:50:58.500 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Vale for
 
00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
bringing up the financial position
 
00:51:03.710 --> 00:51:03.720 align:start position:0%
speaking of the financial issues we have
 
00:51:07.069 --> 00:51:07.079 align:start position:0%
yet to hear the governor's budget the
 
00:51:08.690 --> 00:51:08.700 align:start position:0%
house has yet to
 
00:51:10.549 --> 00:51:10.559 align:start position:0%
deal with their budget so those are a
 
00:51:12.890 --> 00:51:12.900 align:start position:0%
couple of issues that in the short term
 
00:51:16.609 --> 00:51:16.619 align:start position:0%
perhaps we should wait to hear about in
 
00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
the last session this committee passed a
 
00:51:22.549 --> 00:51:22.559 align:start position:0%
bill to empower the department the
 
00:51:25.549 --> 00:51:25.559 align:start position:0%
experts to formulate a plan and I don't
 
00:51:27.770 --> 00:51:27.780 align:start position:0%
believe we've seen that plan yet so I
 
00:51:29.569 --> 00:51:29.579 align:start position:0%
would love for this Committee in the
 
00:51:29.579 --> 00:51:30.410 align:start position:0%
would love for this Committee in the
house

00:51:30.410 --> 00:51:30.420 align:start position:0%
house
 
00:51:33.530 --> 00:51:33.540 align:start position:0%
to see that plan and allow the
 
00:51:35.290 --> 00:51:35.300 align:start position:0%
commission to in fact take a position
 
00:51:38.329 --> 00:51:38.339 align:start position:0%
and give us their expert opinion on this
 
00:51:41.569 --> 00:51:41.579 align:start position:0%
so we could get it right retaining the
 
00:51:44.089 --> 00:51:44.099 align:start position:0%
bill doesn't kill it at all in fact it
 
00:51:46.569 --> 00:51:46.579 align:start position:0%
gives us an opportunity to get it right
 
00:51:49.809 --> 00:51:49.819 align:start position:0%
we support I think
 
00:51:53.930 --> 00:51:53.940 align:start position:0%
bipartisanly a position to get it right
 
00:51:55.430 --> 00:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
and do it right
 
00:51:59.630 --> 00:51:59.640 align:start position:0%
not just Ram It Down The house's throat
 
00:52:03.589 --> 00:52:03.599 align:start position:0%
and arbitrarily put a bad Bill the
 
00:52:05.870 --> 00:52:05.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner says there are problems and
 
00:52:07.849 --> 00:52:07.859 align:start position:0%
they didn't take a position I've never
 
00:52:10.490 --> 00:52:10.500 align:start position:0%
seen a department head like a bill and
 
00:52:11.870 --> 00:52:11.880 align:start position:0%
not support it
 
00:52:14.690 --> 00:52:14.700 align:start position:0%
so I'm urging the committee to retain
 
00:52:17.329 --> 00:52:17.339 align:start position:0%
the bill vote for retention and get it
 
00:52:19.609 --> 00:52:19.619 align:start position:0%
right another
 
00:52:22.730 --> 00:52:22.740 align:start position:0%
couple of months or a couple of weeks in
 
00:52:24.349 --> 00:52:24.359 align:start position:0%
the budget process is not going to hurt
 
00:52:27.710 --> 00:52:27.720 align:start position:0%
us let's get it right
 
00:52:33.190 --> 00:52:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:36.049 --> 00:52:36.059 align:start position:0%
representative wolf
 
00:52:40.270 --> 00:52:40.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman question for you
 
00:52:44.089 --> 00:52:44.099 align:start position:0%
everybody says that it vote to retain
 
00:52:47.150 --> 00:52:47.160 align:start position:0%
kills it until next year
 
00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
my understanding is I can we can bring
 
00:52:50.990 --> 00:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
it back
 
00:52:54.290 --> 00:52:54.300 align:start position:0%
as representative McHugh said in three
 
00:52:56.690 --> 00:52:56.700 align:start position:0%
four weeks or whenever
 
00:53:00.950 --> 00:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh so to get it into this cycle we could
 
00:53:05.210 --> 00:53:05.220 align:start position:0%
bring it back if Des has come ahead with
 
00:53:07.549 --> 00:53:07.559 align:start position:0%
more recommendations we could bring it
 
00:53:09.530 --> 00:53:09.540 align:start position:0%
back we don't have to wait till the
 
00:53:12.589 --> 00:53:12.599 align:start position:0%
usual time of November to discuss it
 
00:53:14.750 --> 00:53:14.760 align:start position:0%
again is that correct
 
00:53:17.990 --> 00:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
I do not believe so
 
00:53:21.170 --> 00:53:21.180 align:start position:0%
now I believe you can have to wait till
 
00:53:24.049 --> 00:53:24.059 align:start position:0%
the summer to do additional
 
00:53:26.690 --> 00:53:26.700 align:start position:0%
work on it or you have to you have to
 
00:53:29.930 --> 00:53:29.940 align:start position:0%
wait to your other work is is completed
 
00:53:32.930 --> 00:53:32.940 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding I could check
 
00:53:37.010 --> 00:53:37.020 align:start position:0%
with the clerk of the house
 
00:53:37.020 --> 00:53:38.510 align:start position:0%
with the clerk of the house
yeah

00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:53:41.089 --> 00:53:41.099 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding no I think
 
00:53:44.750 --> 00:53:44.760 align:start position:0%
retention means it will be worked on
 
00:53:48.770 --> 00:53:48.780 align:start position:0%
but it can't be this it can't be you can
 
00:53:50.690 --> 00:53:50.700 align:start position:0%
work you can work on it
 
00:53:54.430 --> 00:53:54.440 align:start position:0%
but you can't necessarily you can't
 
00:53:56.470 --> 00:53:56.480 align:start position:0%
have a
 
00:54:00.410 --> 00:54:00.420 align:start position:0%
executive session on it until after the
 
00:54:02.510 --> 00:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
you cannot have another executive
 
00:54:04.609 --> 00:54:04.619 align:start position:0%
session is that correct that's my
 
00:54:04.619 --> 00:54:05.809 align:start position:0%
session is that correct that's my
understanding

00:54:05.809 --> 00:54:05.819 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
00:54:05.819 --> 00:54:07.490 align:start position:0%
understanding
but

00:54:07.490 --> 00:54:07.500 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:54:10.790 --> 00:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
I don't know I and I'm let me follow
 
00:54:15.170 --> 00:54:15.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:15.180 --> 00:54:16.490 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:54:16.490 --> 00:54:16.500 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:54:19.010 --> 00:54:19.020 align:start position:0%
one last question on it can we table
 
00:54:23.150 --> 00:54:23.160 align:start position:0%
that motion for today uh yes I can
 
00:54:25.790 --> 00:54:25.800 align:start position:0%
however that would mean
 
00:54:29.089 --> 00:54:29.099 align:start position:0%
a table of motion for today I can tell I
 
00:54:29.099 --> 00:54:29.990 align:start position:0%
a table of motion for today I can tell I
would

00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:54:33.589 --> 00:54:33.599 align:start position:0%
yes I can table the motion or I can't I
 
00:54:37.430 --> 00:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
can't I can I I can in in the discussion
 
00:54:40.130 --> 00:54:40.140 align:start position:0%
on this right right now and bring it
 
00:54:43.190 --> 00:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
back later however we would have to be
 
00:54:45.410 --> 00:54:45.420 align:start position:0%
back here
 
00:54:45.420 --> 00:54:47.990 align:start position:0%
back here
Within

00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
Within
 
00:54:50.750 --> 00:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
by next uh next week
 
00:54:53.390 --> 00:54:53.400 align:start position:0%
to be the is the drop dead date on
 
00:54:54.650 --> 00:54:54.660 align:start position:0%
hearing this
 
00:54:57.049 --> 00:54:57.059 align:start position:0%
because it is an early bill
 
00:54:57.059 --> 00:54:58.849 align:start position:0%
because it is an early bill
so

00:54:58.849 --> 00:54:58.859 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:55:01.849 --> 00:55:01.859 align:start position:0%
yes I cannot but I can I can find that
 
00:55:01.859 --> 00:55:02.809 align:start position:0%
yes I cannot but I can I can find that
out

00:55:02.809 --> 00:55:02.819 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:55:06.410 --> 00:55:06.420 align:start position:0%
after we finish here I postponed this to
 
00:55:07.910 --> 00:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
the end of the
 
00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:08.930 align:start position:0%
the end of the
uh

00:55:08.930 --> 00:55:08.940 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:55:13.089 --> 00:55:13.099 align:start position:0%
sort of the first break to be able to
 
00:55:15.829 --> 00:55:15.839 align:start position:0%
find to find out to call the clerk's
 
00:55:17.809 --> 00:55:17.819 align:start position:0%
office to be certain as to what I'm
 
00:55:17.819 --> 00:55:24.849 align:start position:0%
office to be certain as to what I'm
saying

00:55:24.849 --> 00:55:24.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:29.390 --> 00:55:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:31.730 --> 00:55:31.740 align:start position:0%
I guess that would then be my request is
 
00:55:33.470 --> 00:55:33.480 align:start position:0%
to postpone it till you can get us some
 
00:55:36.230 --> 00:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
answers on this okay I got I will do
 
00:55:38.569 --> 00:55:38.579 align:start position:0%
that representative wrong yeah a couple
 
00:55:42.230 --> 00:55:42.240 align:start position:0%
points one is Mr uh representative you
 
00:55:44.270 --> 00:55:44.280 align:start position:0%
raised the issue about D yes it's the
 
00:55:46.670 --> 00:55:46.680 align:start position:0%
only the only concern they raised is the
 
00:55:48.589 --> 00:55:48.599 align:start position:0%
fact about the loan that some of these
 
00:55:51.290 --> 00:55:51.300 align:start position:0%
associations may not I addressed that an
 
00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
amendment that was just distributed and
 
00:55:56.569 --> 00:55:56.579 align:start position:0%
I really want to make the point that
 
00:55:58.430 --> 00:55:58.440 align:start position:0%
um this isn't just about Lakes
 
00:56:00.910 --> 00:56:00.920 align:start position:0%
Recreation health of people in The Lakes
 
00:56:05.510 --> 00:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
we have at least 23 Municipal Water
 
00:56:08.270 --> 00:56:08.280 align:start position:0%
Systems that pull from surface water and
 
00:56:10.370 --> 00:56:10.380 align:start position:0%
we have seen last year in the month of
 
00:56:14.089 --> 00:56:14.099 align:start position:0%
May one of those was a victim of a
 
00:56:16.430 --> 00:56:16.440 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria bloom and that was in
 
00:56:19.490 --> 00:56:19.500 align:start position:0%
Salem we also saw it in Bow and it's
 
00:56:21.710 --> 00:56:21.720 align:start position:0%
only going to get worse cyanobacteria
 
00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
especially after the mild winter we've
 
00:56:26.450 --> 00:56:26.460 align:start position:0%
had so far there's
 
00:56:29.329 --> 00:56:29.339 align:start position:0%
um nothing that prevents us from making
 
00:56:32.030 --> 00:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
making a decision now I really urge the
 
00:56:35.210 --> 00:56:35.220 align:start position:0%
committee to not vote to retain this
 
00:56:38.030 --> 00:56:38.040 align:start position:0%
because it's going to be impossible to
 
00:56:41.690 --> 00:56:41.700 align:start position:0%
get a bill to set up this kind of a fund
 
00:56:43.130 --> 00:56:43.140 align:start position:0%
in the second year after the budget's
 
00:56:44.930 --> 00:56:44.940 align:start position:0%
already been passed we have someone here
 
00:56:47.510 --> 00:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
from Des who oversees the cyanobacteria
 
00:56:50.210 --> 00:56:50.220 align:start position:0%
program I'm sure he would be willing to
 
00:56:53.630 --> 00:56:53.640 align:start position:0%
speak about how this does not compromise
 
00:56:56.390 --> 00:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
any of the work or would be impacted by
 
00:56:58.069 --> 00:56:58.079 align:start position:0%
that plan that will be coming out in
 
00:57:00.650 --> 00:57:00.660 align:start position:0%
November so if any of the committee
 
00:57:02.270 --> 00:57:02.280 align:start position:0%
wants you know Mr chair if you want to
 
00:57:04.670 --> 00:57:04.680 align:start position:0%
call him up and ask him you know how
 
00:57:07.970 --> 00:57:07.980 align:start position:0%
does this interface with the work that
 
00:57:10.190 --> 00:57:10.200 align:start position:0%
Des is doing on their cyanobacteria
 
00:57:12.230 --> 00:57:12.240 align:start position:0%
Bloom I'm sure he'd be willing to offer
 
00:57:14.569 --> 00:57:14.579 align:start position:0%
you know his his opinion
 
00:57:20.829 --> 00:57:20.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:25.790 --> 00:57:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:29.809 --> 00:57:29.819 align:start position:0%
all right yeah you you used to speak yes
 
00:57:32.030 --> 00:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
thank you um may I ask representative
 
00:57:33.950 --> 00:57:33.960 align:start position:0%
wrong I do not have a copy of that
 
00:57:45.650 --> 00:57:45.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:47.329 --> 00:57:47.339 align:start position:0%
I don't think the amendment made it over
 
00:57:50.690 --> 00:57:50.700 align:start position:0%
here either so here's your work yeah I
 
00:58:04.210 --> 00:58:04.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:17.030 --> 00:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:19.430 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:58:22.250 --> 00:58:22.260 align:start position:0%
all right uh
 
00:58:24.829 --> 00:58:24.839 align:start position:0%
representative Veil
 
00:58:28.430 --> 00:58:28.440 align:start position:0%
we didn't um anticipate a tabling motion
 
00:58:31.069 --> 00:58:31.079 align:start position:0%
and so I would like us to walk people
 
00:58:34.250 --> 00:58:34.260 align:start position:0%
through how that works there is no
 
00:58:38.450 --> 00:58:38.460 align:start position:0%
there is no tabling motion allowed what
 
00:58:42.289 --> 00:58:42.299 align:start position:0%
I can do as chair is I can recess or
 
00:58:43.849 --> 00:58:43.859 align:start position:0%
make a phone call
 
00:58:46.789 --> 00:58:46.799 align:start position:0%

question okay so rather than continue
 
00:58:57.710 --> 00:58:57.720 align:start position:0%
the discussion without that knowledge
 
00:59:01.069 --> 00:59:01.079 align:start position:0%
I will recess for
 
00:59:03.530 --> 00:59:03.540 align:start position:0%
five minutes or as long as the phone

call to the
oh yeah

00:59:40.430 --> 00:59:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:46.030 --> 00:59:46.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:28.390 --> 01:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:31.910 --> 01:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
retained builds uh cannot work on
 
01:20:34.189 --> 01:20:34.199 align:start position:0%
retained bills according to my
 
01:20:36.470 --> 01:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
conversation with the clerk
 
01:20:38.570 --> 01:20:38.580 align:start position:0%
you cannot work on retained bills and
 
01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:40.679 align:start position:0%
Bill you've finished all of your
 
01:20:40.679 --> 01:20:42.169 align:start position:0%
Bill you've finished all of your
business

01:20:42.169 --> 01:20:42.179 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:20:46.490 --> 01:20:46.500 align:start position:0%
and uh in of of this year and so that
 
01:20:46.500 --> 01:20:47.570 align:start position:0%
and uh in of of this year and so that
will

01:20:47.570 --> 01:20:47.580 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:20:50.270 --> 01:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
01:20:54.410 --> 01:20:54.420 align:start position:0%
it's not a uh I think that
 
01:20:54.420 --> 01:20:56.050 align:start position:0%
it's not a uh I think that
foreign

01:20:56.050 --> 01:20:56.060 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:21:00.229 --> 01:21:00.239 align:start position:0%
if we do vote retention it would not be
 
01:21:01.790 --> 01:21:01.800 align:start position:0%
meet the
 
01:21:04.610 --> 01:21:04.620 align:start position:0%
would not meet the the deadline that you
 
01:21:07.790 --> 01:21:07.800 align:start position:0%
were speaking of representative well
 
01:21:10.729 --> 01:21:10.739 align:start position:0%

01:22:52.669 --> 01:22:52.679 align:start position:0%
oh here it is okay
 
01:22:55.850 --> 01:22:55.860 align:start position:0%
I used to speak to your motion yeah we
 
01:22:58.970 --> 01:22:58.980 align:start position:0%
suspected the amendment okay I I believe
 
01:23:02.330 --> 01:23:02.340 align:start position:0%
representative Darby yeah okay
 
01:23:04.130 --> 01:23:04.140 align:start position:0%
um during the public hearing there were
 
01:23:06.770 --> 01:23:06.780 align:start position:0%
two primary concerns
 
01:23:09.169 --> 01:23:09.179 align:start position:0%
actually I think only two concerns one
 
01:23:12.229 --> 01:23:12.239 align:start position:0%
was raised in a letter from commissioner
 
01:23:16.189 --> 01:23:16.199 align:start position:0%
Scott that he he was concerned and it
 
01:23:18.950 --> 01:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
was on the second page that their
 
01:23:20.630 --> 01:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
um the financial burden of managing
 
01:23:22.250 --> 01:23:22.260 align:start position:0%
problems within Waters of the state
 
01:23:24.530 --> 01:23:24.540 align:start position:0%
holds in trust is shifted to communities
 
01:23:26.689 --> 01:23:26.699 align:start position:0%
volunteer groups
 
01:23:30.169 --> 01:23:30.179 align:start position:0%
um oh actually that's the wrong one um
 
01:23:33.410 --> 01:23:33.420 align:start position:0%
he said it may be pragmatic because some
 
01:23:36.530 --> 01:23:36.540 align:start position:0%
of these associations may not be large
 
01:23:40.010 --> 01:23:40.020 align:start position:0%
enough to qualify for a loan so I
 
01:23:44.990 --> 01:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
amended the bill to include a grant
 
01:23:47.149 --> 01:23:47.159 align:start position:0%
aspect to it so
 
01:23:51.290 --> 01:23:51.300 align:start position:0%
um Des when reviewing applications could
 
01:23:53.689 --> 01:23:53.699 align:start position:0%
decide whether it should be grant or
 
01:23:58.550 --> 01:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
loan and I used the current we have a
 
01:24:00.830 --> 01:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
administration of the drinking water and
 
01:24:04.310 --> 01:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
groundwater trust fund I based some of
 
01:24:06.050 --> 01:24:06.060 align:start position:0%
that change on that so that's one change
 
01:24:09.110 --> 01:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
so it could be a grant and it could be a
 
01:24:12.470 --> 01:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
loan and it there still exists an
 
01:24:14.689 --> 01:24:14.699 align:start position:0%
opportunity for loan forgiveness so
 
01:24:18.110 --> 01:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
those are the three ways that projects
 
01:24:21.590 --> 01:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
can be funded the other change I made is
 
01:24:23.630 --> 01:24:23.640 align:start position:0%
on page
 
01:24:26.270 --> 01:24:26.280 align:start position:0%
um two line
 
01:24:28.430 --> 01:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
uh 17
 
01:24:30.890 --> 01:24:30.900 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair you raised an issue about
 
01:24:35.510 --> 01:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
oversight of of this fund so I included
 
01:24:37.970 --> 01:24:37.980 align:start position:0%
the a duty of the Department of
 
01:24:41.570 --> 01:24:41.580 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services is to
 
01:24:43.669 --> 01:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
um Administration includes oversight of
 
01:24:45.770 --> 01:24:45.780 align:start position:0%
the grant or loan expenditures to ensure
 
01:24:47.630 --> 01:24:47.640 align:start position:0%
they are not misused
 
01:24:50.450 --> 01:24:50.460 align:start position:0%
so those were the two issues that I
 
01:24:50.460 --> 01:24:52.010 align:start position:0%
so those were the two issues that I
captured

01:24:52.010 --> 01:24:52.020 align:start position:0%
captured
 
01:24:54.649 --> 01:24:54.659 align:start position:0%
um there were some very minor changes
 
01:24:56.990 --> 01:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
there was one line where municipalities
 
01:24:59.090 --> 01:24:59.100 align:start position:0%
was listed in one part of the bill and
 
01:25:00.709 --> 01:25:00.719 align:start position:0%
not in the other so you'll see on line
 
01:25:05.450 --> 01:25:05.460 align:start position:0%
23 I um municipalities are also
 
01:25:07.729 --> 01:25:07.739 align:start position:0%
qualified to apply I mean they were
 
01:25:09.649 --> 01:25:09.659 align:start position:0%
qualified to apply in another part of
 
01:25:11.330 --> 01:25:11.340 align:start position:0%
the bill but I wanted to make it
 
01:25:13.850 --> 01:25:13.860 align:start position:0%
consistent and I think there were just a
 
01:25:15.850 --> 01:25:15.860 align:start position:0%
couple minor grammatical
 
01:25:18.890 --> 01:25:18.900 align:start position:0%
issues but other than that the amendment
 
01:25:21.890 --> 01:25:21.900 align:start position:0%
incorporates those two major issues that
 
01:25:24.770 --> 01:25:24.780 align:start position:0%
were brought up and I do want to refer
 
01:25:27.290 --> 01:25:27.300 align:start position:0%
back to commissioner Scott's letter in
 
01:25:29.930 --> 01:25:29.940 align:start position:0%
the second to the last paragraph he said
 
01:25:34.390 --> 01:25:34.400 align:start position:0%
as written HB 276 is targeted to fund
 
01:25:36.729 --> 01:25:36.739 align:start position:0%
cost-effective and appropriate
 
01:25:40.510 --> 01:25:40.520 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria mitigation projects
 
01:25:43.430 --> 01:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
he and his last sentence of that letter
 
01:25:45.169 --> 01:25:45.179 align:start position:0%
is the plan will include many
 
01:25:47.030 --> 01:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
recommendations this is the plan coming
 
01:25:49.790 --> 01:25:49.800 align:start position:0%
in November some of which will without a
 
01:25:51.310 --> 01:25:51.320 align:start position:0%
doubt include suggestions for
 
01:25:53.209 --> 01:25:53.219 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria Bloom mitigation
 
01:25:55.669 --> 01:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
strategies including the resources
 
01:25:59.390 --> 01:25:59.400 align:start position:0%
needed for implementation so the outcome
 
01:26:03.649 --> 01:26:03.659 align:start position:0%
of that November plan will be able there
 
01:26:07.729 --> 01:26:07.739 align:start position:0%
will be funds if this passes to be able
 
01:26:10.370 --> 01:26:10.380 align:start position:0%
to implement those as well as other
 
01:26:13.729 --> 01:26:13.739 align:start position:0%
projects that Des is considering being
 
01:26:16.370 --> 01:26:16.380 align:start position:0%
submitted from municipalities lake or
 
01:26:19.430 --> 01:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
Watershed associations so what this does
 
01:26:21.950 --> 01:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
is it enables Des to address these
 
01:26:26.229 --> 01:26:26.239 align:start position:0%
concerns in fiscal year 2024
 
01:26:28.610 --> 01:26:28.620 align:start position:0%
without having to wait for another
 
01:26:31.729 --> 01:26:31.739 align:start position:0%
biennium opportunity to get this in this
 
01:26:36.229 --> 01:26:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:38.450 --> 01:26:38.460 align:start position:0%
representative Darby to speak to the
 
01:26:40.790 --> 01:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
amendment uh thank you Mr chair very
 
01:26:43.129 --> 01:26:43.139 align:start position:0%
briefly I'd just like to reinforce the
 
01:26:46.310 --> 01:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
value of the amendment in the um in
 
01:26:48.649 --> 01:26:48.659 align:start position:0%
supporting the small Lake Associations
 
01:26:48.659 --> 01:26:50.030 align:start position:0%
supporting the small Lake Associations
that

01:26:50.030 --> 01:26:50.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:26:53.030 --> 01:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
um are so numerous across our state
 
01:26:55.010 --> 01:26:55.020 align:start position:0%
um we heard about that there was concern
 
01:26:57.350 --> 01:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
about their inability because of their
 
01:27:00.830 --> 01:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
low Revenue flow to be able to obtain a
 
01:27:03.110 --> 01:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
loan on their own and this will this
 
01:27:05.750 --> 01:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
will provide this amendment is critical
 
01:27:09.370 --> 01:27:09.380 align:start position:0%
to being able to provide you know the
 
01:27:12.590 --> 01:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria mitigation for the
 
01:27:14.330 --> 01:27:14.340 align:start position:0%
numerous numerous small lakes that we
 
01:27:16.669 --> 01:27:16.679 align:start position:0%
have thank you
 
01:27:19.430 --> 01:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
anyone else who helps us to speak the
 
01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:21.050 align:start position:0%
anyone else who helps us to speak the
question

01:27:21.050 --> 01:27:21.060 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:27:24.050 --> 01:27:24.060 align:start position:0%
for a question thank you Mr chair
 
01:27:26.149 --> 01:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
um so uh representative wrong thank you
 
01:27:26.159 --> 01:27:27.890 align:start position:0%
um so uh representative wrong thank you
for

01:27:27.890 --> 01:27:27.900 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:27:30.830 --> 01:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
uh taking my question but uh the
 
01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:32.149 align:start position:0%
uh taking my question but uh the
original

01:27:32.149 --> 01:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
original
 
01:27:35.629 --> 01:27:35.639 align:start position:0%
House Bill 276 was alone
 
01:27:38.570 --> 01:27:38.580 align:start position:0%
uh was based on a loan with a 10 for
 
01:27:40.310 --> 01:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
forgiveness if I was reading it
 
01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:41.209 align:start position:0%
forgiveness if I was reading it
correctly

01:27:41.209 --> 01:27:41.219 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
01:27:45.410 --> 01:27:45.420 align:start position:0%
and just to clarify this amendment
 
01:27:49.129 --> 01:27:49.139 align:start position:0%
is 25 million dollars which could all be
 
01:27:49.139 --> 01:27:50.149 align:start position:0%
is 25 million dollars which could all be
grants

01:27:50.149 --> 01:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
grants
 
01:27:53.390 --> 01:27:53.400 align:start position:0%
with no loan provision
 
01:27:56.030 --> 01:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
they could possibly just
 
01:27:58.310 --> 01:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
it'll be costing us 25 million dollars
 
01:27:58.320 --> 01:27:59.570 align:start position:0%
it'll be costing us 25 million dollars
because

01:27:59.570 --> 01:27:59.580 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:28:01.490 --> 01:28:01.500 align:start position:0%
Lake Associations don't have the money
 
01:28:03.530 --> 01:28:03.540 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
01:28:06.470 --> 01:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
well it it could still be a loan I mean
 
01:28:10.250 --> 01:28:10.260 align:start position:0%
for instance the town of malt or
 
01:28:10.260 --> 01:28:11.750 align:start position:0%
for instance the town of malt or
Guilford

01:28:11.750 --> 01:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
Guilford
 
01:28:15.430 --> 01:28:15.440 align:start position:0%
um Des could require a loan to mitigate
 
01:28:19.330 --> 01:28:19.340 align:start position:0%
instances where there's runoff affecting
 
01:28:23.270 --> 01:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
elukoya State Park or in that area but
 
01:28:25.330 --> 01:28:25.340 align:start position:0%
for smaller associations
 
01:28:29.390 --> 01:28:29.400 align:start position:0%
they could decide to issue a grant that
 
01:28:31.910 --> 01:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
decision would be incorporated in
 
01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:33.709 align:start position:0%
decision would be incorporated in
rulemaking

01:28:33.709 --> 01:28:33.719 align:start position:0%
rulemaking
 
01:28:36.890 --> 01:28:36.900 align:start position:0%
and I would expect that des and we do
 
01:28:38.510 --> 01:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
have people here from DS that could
 
01:28:42.290 --> 01:28:42.300 align:start position:0%
respond but in rule making Diaz could
 
01:28:45.110 --> 01:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
um establish a threshold where
 
01:28:46.790 --> 01:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
um a loan would have to be required
 
01:28:52.370 --> 01:28:52.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:55.310 --> 01:28:55.320 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else uh wishes to speak
 
01:29:00.169 --> 01:29:00.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:02.510 --> 01:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
01:29:04.790 --> 01:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
on the amendment
 
01:29:07.850 --> 01:29:07.860 align:start position:0%
pardon oh I'm sorry I didn't mean that
 
01:29:09.950 --> 01:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
they're gonna make you thank you Mr
 
01:29:12.050 --> 01:29:12.060 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you representative for
 
01:29:13.610 --> 01:29:13.620 align:start position:0%
bringing the amendment definitely an
 
01:29:13.620 --> 01:29:15.229 align:start position:0%
bringing the amendment definitely an
improvement

01:29:15.229 --> 01:29:15.239 align:start position:0%
improvement
 
01:29:16.910 --> 01:29:16.920 align:start position:0%
and I look forward to seeing the plan
 
01:29:19.370 --> 01:29:19.380 align:start position:0%
but uh definitely support the amendment
 
01:29:21.050 --> 01:29:21.060 align:start position:0%
addresses some of the issues
 
01:29:22.129 --> 01:29:22.139 align:start position:0%
that you mentioned from the
 
01:29:24.050 --> 01:29:24.060 align:start position:0%
commissioner's letter
 
01:29:26.030 --> 01:29:26.040 align:start position:0%
so along with representative wolf I
 
01:29:27.470 --> 01:29:27.480 align:start position:0%
think we should probably go forward with
 
01:29:30.470 --> 01:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
this amendment and finance will probably
 
01:29:32.750 --> 01:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
work its magic a bit I suspect
 
01:29:35.570 --> 01:29:35.580 align:start position:0%
but uh the policy issue we do support
 
01:29:37.610 --> 01:29:37.620 align:start position:0%
medication of cyanobacteria across the
 
01:29:42.010 --> 01:29:42.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:47.570 --> 01:29:47.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:49.010 --> 01:29:49.020 align:start position:0%
um I am also in support of this
 
01:29:51.350 --> 01:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
amendment I think this addresses the two
 
01:29:54.530 --> 01:29:54.540 align:start position:0%
areas that we heard about and um and I'm
 
01:29:57.110 --> 01:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
hoping that with some of these
 
01:29:59.870 --> 01:29:59.880 align:start position:0%
um Corrections and with this amendment
 
01:30:02.870 --> 01:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
that we can get the pal bill passed and
 
01:30:04.070 --> 01:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
send it down with a positive
 
01:30:05.990 --> 01:30:06.000 align:start position:0%

um that I strongly agree with this as a
 
01:31:55.129 --> 01:31:55.139 align:start position:0%
policy commitment from myself and
 
01:31:57.530 --> 01:31:57.540 align:start position:0%
hopefully from our committee and that um
 
01:31:59.629 --> 01:31:59.639 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to leave it up to the finance
 
01:32:02.570 --> 01:32:02.580 align:start position:0%
committee to study further the financial
 
01:32:07.729 --> 01:32:07.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:11.930 --> 01:32:11.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:13.970 --> 01:32:13.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I want to thank

01:32:19.910 --> 01:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
committee listening to the arguments on
 
01:32:21.590 --> 01:32:21.600 align:start position:0%

01:32:24.110 --> 01:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
hopefully you'll all vote for it and we
 
01:32:26.209 --> 01:32:26.219 align:start position:0%
can pass it on to find it
 
01:32:30.050 --> 01:32:30.060 align:start position:0%
to deal with thank you thank you
 
01:32:34.310 --> 01:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:36.830 --> 01:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
representative Darby thank you Mr chair
 
01:32:39.649 --> 01:32:39.659 align:start position:0%
just a couple of quick points
 
01:32:42.890 --> 01:32:42.900 align:start position:0%
um first off is we heard scary testimony
 
01:32:46.850 --> 01:32:46.860 align:start position:0%
in my opinion from a number of Lake
 
01:32:48.850 --> 01:32:48.860 align:start position:0%
Associations that had seen the first
 
01:32:51.470 --> 01:32:51.480 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria blooms ever over the last
 
01:32:54.590 --> 01:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
two years so waiting two more years is
 
01:32:58.669 --> 01:32:58.679 align:start position:0%
would be uh catastrophic in in my
 
01:33:00.350 --> 01:33:00.360 align:start position:0%
opinion in terms of the number that we
 
01:33:02.930 --> 01:33:02.940 align:start position:0%
would see across the lake
 
01:33:06.050 --> 01:33:06.060 align:start position:0%
um we also heard that the
 
01:33:09.470 --> 01:33:09.480 align:start position:0%
um the further that we delay in MIDI
 
01:33:11.990 --> 01:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
that that these associations delay in
 
01:33:13.810 --> 01:33:13.820 align:start position:0%
being able to mitigate their
 
01:33:17.750 --> 01:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria blooms uh the more the
 
01:33:20.149 --> 01:33:20.159 align:start position:0%
costs increase so another reason that
 
01:33:22.310 --> 01:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
you know I would
 
01:33:25.070 --> 01:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
um urge that we vote ought to pass amend
 
01:33:27.649 --> 01:33:27.659 align:start position:0%
with the amendment on this to you know
 
01:33:31.189 --> 01:33:31.199 align:start position:0%
nip these costs in the bud while we can
 
01:33:32.689 --> 01:33:32.699 align:start position:0%
um lastly
 
01:33:35.570 --> 01:33:35.580 align:start position:0%
um my recollection from the uh from the
 
01:33:37.610 --> 01:33:37.620 align:start position:0%
testimony with Des with respect to the
 
01:33:40.070 --> 01:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
timing of the um the plan that they're
 
01:33:42.350 --> 01:33:42.360 align:start position:0%
working on and the timing of these funds
 
01:33:45.229 --> 01:33:45.239 align:start position:0%
is that these um the availability of
 
01:33:48.110 --> 01:33:48.120 align:start position:0%
these funds would dovetail well with um
 
01:33:50.209 --> 01:33:50.219 align:start position:0%
when their plan would be worked out so
 
01:33:51.830 --> 01:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
that when it's when the plan is
 
01:33:53.810 --> 01:33:53.820 align:start position:0%
completed in November
 
01:33:56.390 --> 01:33:56.400 align:start position:0%
um the uh they would they would have the
 
01:33:58.129 --> 01:33:58.139 align:start position:0%
funds available to start working with
 
01:34:00.590 --> 01:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities and like associations and
 
01:34:03.770 --> 01:34:03.780 align:start position:0%
lastly I just mentioned that the
 
01:34:03.780 --> 01:34:04.550 align:start position:0%
lastly I just mentioned that the
um

01:34:04.550 --> 01:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:07.310 --> 01:34:07.320 align:start position:0%
the bill had overwhelming massive
 
01:34:08.709 --> 01:34:08.719 align:start position:0%
support online
 
01:34:12.970 --> 01:34:12.980 align:start position:0%
185 in favor and a handful against
 
01:34:16.550 --> 01:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
this is an immensely popular bill
 
01:34:20.149 --> 01:34:20.159 align:start position:0%
um across the uh across the state not
 
01:34:23.330 --> 01:34:23.340 align:start position:0%
just with uh Lake you know with Lake
 
01:34:25.070 --> 01:34:25.080 align:start position:0%
Associations and people that own
 
01:34:26.930 --> 01:34:26.940 align:start position:0%
properties on lakes but also those that
 
01:34:30.229 --> 01:34:30.239 align:start position:0%
are dry in the water from the um from
 
01:34:32.689 --> 01:34:32.699 align:start position:0%
the surface water itself and some of the
 
01:34:32.699 --> 01:34:33.950 align:start position:0%
the surface water itself and some of the
scary

01:34:33.950 --> 01:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
scary
 
01:34:36.410 --> 01:34:36.420 align:start position:0%
um you know situations that a
 
01:34:38.030 --> 01:34:38.040 align:start position:0%
representative wrong mentioned earlier
 
01:34:38.040 --> 01:34:39.229 align:start position:0%
representative wrong mentioned earlier
so

01:34:39.229 --> 01:34:39.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:34:41.990 --> 01:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
um I would urge the uh you know that we
 
01:34:43.729 --> 01:34:43.739 align:start position:0%
come forth with a really strong
 
01:34:46.610 --> 01:34:46.620 align:start position:0%
recommendation at committee for octopus
 
01:34:50.390 --> 01:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:52.910 --> 01:34:52.920 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else before I have my
 
01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:53.750 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else before I have my
peace

01:34:53.750 --> 01:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
peace
 
01:34:55.910 --> 01:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:34:59.990 --> 01:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
I will not be voting for this bill
 
01:35:02.750 --> 01:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
all I know is that
 
01:35:05.750 --> 01:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
last session
 
01:35:08.149 --> 01:35:08.159 align:start position:0%
a bill came in
 
01:35:10.729 --> 01:35:10.739 align:start position:0%
a bill that would have
 
01:35:14.590 --> 01:35:14.600 align:start position:0%
had a study commission instead of
 
01:35:18.470 --> 01:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
percent anal bacteria
 
01:35:21.890 --> 01:35:21.900 align:start position:0%
and its study commission was going to be
 
01:35:25.070 --> 01:35:25.080 align:start position:0%
for four plus years
 
01:35:29.570 --> 01:35:29.580 align:start position:0%
and everybody was oh we really want this
 
01:35:34.790 --> 01:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
you know every now those same people
 
01:35:39.709 --> 01:35:39.719 align:start position:0%
say that we have to have this now we
 
01:35:42.470 --> 01:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
must have everything we must the the
 
01:35:45.950 --> 01:35:45.960 align:start position:0%
tidal wave is upon us well apparently it
 
01:35:48.290 --> 01:35:48.300 align:start position:0%
wasn't upon us last year
 
01:35:50.750 --> 01:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
because last year what we did when we
 
01:35:52.490 --> 01:35:52.500 align:start position:0%
got that bill
 
01:35:55.729 --> 01:35:55.739 align:start position:0%
we said four years is too much we feel
 
01:36:00.129 --> 01:36:00.139 align:start position:0%
that the committee's failed that we know
 
01:36:04.070 --> 01:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria bacteria is an issue let's
 
01:36:07.070 --> 01:36:07.080 align:start position:0%
do something really radical
 
01:36:10.310 --> 01:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
let's ask d-e-s
 
01:36:13.610 --> 01:36:13.620 align:start position:0%
to make a plan
 
01:36:15.229 --> 01:36:15.239 align:start position:0%
to fix it
 
01:36:19.610 --> 01:36:19.620 align:start position:0%
and the zes to their credit stood tall
 
01:36:22.729 --> 01:36:22.739 align:start position:0%
and said yes we will
 
01:36:27.770 --> 01:36:27.780 align:start position:0%
and with that I've I felt that
 
01:36:30.070 --> 01:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
they should be given all the support
 
01:36:34.310 --> 01:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
necessary to get the job done
 
01:36:38.450 --> 01:36:38.460 align:start position:0%
well now we're Des is in the midst of
 
01:36:41.689 --> 01:36:41.699 align:start position:0%
doing that they're doing a job but what
 
01:36:43.970 --> 01:36:43.980 align:start position:0%
I see they're doing a fantastic job
 
01:36:47.030 --> 01:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
moving forward
 
01:36:49.970 --> 01:36:49.980 align:start position:0%
they the agreement was they would bring
 
01:36:53.750 --> 01:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
something forward in November
 
01:36:56.090 --> 01:36:56.100 align:start position:0%
and part of that they had they were
 
01:36:59.570 --> 01:36:59.580 align:start position:0%
going to have this plan ready
 
01:36:59.580 --> 01:37:01.430 align:start position:0%
going to have this plan ready
and

01:37:01.430 --> 01:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:37:04.370 --> 01:37:04.380 align:start position:0%
now all of a sudden it's
 
01:37:06.890 --> 01:37:06.900 align:start position:0%
we're back to the way we were before
 
01:37:06.900 --> 01:37:08.810 align:start position:0%
we're back to the way we were before
just

01:37:08.810 --> 01:37:08.820 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:37:11.090 --> 01:37:11.100 align:start position:0%
turned throwing this football out there
 
01:37:15.590 --> 01:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
and hoping that Des pass catches it
 
01:37:18.229 --> 01:37:18.239 align:start position:0%
I don't know what to say folks
 
01:37:22.370 --> 01:37:22.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:22.380 --> 01:37:23.990 align:start position:0%
 
the

01:37:23.990 --> 01:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:37:26.750 --> 01:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
the job you're doing is great
 
01:37:29.890 --> 01:37:29.900 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm sad that we're going to be
 
01:37:32.030 --> 01:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
circumventing your
 
01:37:35.270 --> 01:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:37.250 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:37:37.250 --> 01:37:37.260 align:start position:0%

01:37:41.390 --> 01:37:41.400 align:start position:0%

um
 
01:40:35.450 --> 01:40:35.460 align:start position:0%
I recommend that we retain this bill
 
01:40:42.350 --> 01:40:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:44.570 --> 01:40:44.580 align:start position:0%

I'll second second by representative
harp

01:40:48.770 --> 01:40:48.780 align:start position:0%
harp
 
01:40:52.250 --> 01:40:52.260 align:start position:0%
is to speak to your motion
 
01:40:54.770 --> 01:40:54.780 align:start position:0%
um when uh the testimony was being given
 
01:40:57.169 --> 01:40:57.179 align:start position:0%
by the by the different parties we uh
 
01:40:58.669 --> 01:40:58.679 align:start position:0%
heard very good
 
01:41:01.250 --> 01:41:01.260 align:start position:0%
um testimony about the uh the the
 
01:41:05.450 --> 01:41:05.460 align:start position:0%
forward uh progress of what uh
 
01:41:08.149 --> 01:41:08.159 align:start position:0%
um uh I'll say unmanned
 
01:41:12.189 --> 01:41:12.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:14.689 --> 01:41:14.699 align:start position:0%
whose drones is too limiting I heard I
 
01:41:17.030 --> 01:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
learned during that testimony so
 
01:41:19.070 --> 01:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
um but I think there's a lot that both
 
01:41:20.390 --> 01:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
parties learned
 
01:41:22.490 --> 01:41:22.500 align:start position:0%
um by talking to each other and I
 
01:41:25.310 --> 01:41:25.320 align:start position:0%
actually uh think that they even agree
 
01:41:28.550 --> 01:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
that there's more work to be done in
 
01:41:30.709 --> 01:41:30.719 align:start position:0%
addition I know that there's been other
 
01:41:30.719 --> 01:41:31.910 align:start position:0%
addition I know that there's been other
um

01:41:31.910 --> 01:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:34.310 --> 01:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
Parks across other
 
01:41:37.550 --> 01:41:37.560 align:start position:0%
states that have done drone
 
01:41:40.669 --> 01:41:40.679 align:start position:0%
um unmanned applying things
 
01:41:43.430 --> 01:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
that they uh they actually have come up
 
01:41:44.510 --> 01:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
with different plans so I think there's
 
01:41:47.629 --> 01:41:47.639 align:start position:0%
an opportunity for uh some growth in the
 
01:41:50.570 --> 01:41:50.580 align:start position:0%
the bill itself and working with
 
01:41:53.149 --> 01:41:53.159 align:start position:0%
um both the uh the person that brought
 
01:41:56.689 --> 01:41:56.699 align:start position:0%
it forward and the FAA
 
01:41:59.030 --> 01:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:02.290 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

01:42:02.290 --> 01:42:02.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:04.910 --> 01:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
echoing with representative Donnelly
 
01:42:07.070 --> 01:42:07.080 align:start position:0%
said I'd just like to add that it's my
 
01:42:08.870 --> 01:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
understanding the sponsor also
 
01:42:10.550 --> 01:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
understands that the bill should be
 
01:42:13.129 --> 01:42:13.139 align:start position:0%
retained so that we can work on it hence
 
01:42:17.570 --> 01:42:17.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:17.580 --> 01:42:19.149 align:start position:0%
 
any

01:42:19.149 --> 01:42:19.159 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:42:22.129 --> 01:42:22.139 align:start position:0%
representative fail
 
01:42:24.350 --> 01:42:24.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:42:28.430 --> 01:42:28.440 align:start position:0%
my understanding also is that from um in
 
01:42:30.590 --> 01:42:30.600 align:start position:0%
support of the bill in support of the
 
01:42:32.450 --> 01:42:32.460 align:start position:0%
motion is that if we move to retain then
 
01:42:33.950 --> 01:42:33.960 align:start position:0%
we'll have time to go to the Department
 
01:42:36.169 --> 01:42:36.179 align:start position:0%
of Transportation and get some
 
01:42:37.850 --> 01:42:37.860 align:start position:0%
instruction on some of the things that
 
01:42:39.950 --> 01:42:39.960 align:start position:0%
we're voting on so that we know what
 
01:42:42.109 --> 01:42:42.119 align:start position:0%
we're what the vehicle actually is when
 
01:42:43.930 --> 01:42:43.940 align:start position:0%
we're talking about an unmanned aircraft
 
01:42:46.609 --> 01:42:46.619 align:start position:0%
so I think this would give us time to
 
01:42:48.229 --> 01:42:48.239 align:start position:0%
explore what we need to explore into
 
01:42:50.510 --> 01:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
perhaps you know really anchor this in
 
01:42:53.570 --> 01:42:53.580 align:start position:0%
some less abstract
 
01:42:53.580 --> 01:42:54.590 align:start position:0%
some less abstract
um

01:42:54.590 --> 01:42:54.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:56.570 --> 01:42:56.580 align:start position:0%
and see it in person I guess is what I'm
 
01:42:59.990 --> 01:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:05.090 --> 01:43:05.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:05.100 --> 01:43:07.689 align:start position:0%
 
oh

01:43:07.689 --> 01:43:07.699 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:43:11.390 --> 01:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
thank thank you Mr chair
 
01:43:14.629 --> 01:43:14.639 align:start position:0%
um I I agree that this bill needs some
 
01:43:16.010 --> 01:43:16.020 align:start position:0%
work I mean drones aren't even
 
01:43:18.290 --> 01:43:18.300 align:start position:0%
identified in statute
 
01:43:19.970 --> 01:43:19.980 align:start position:0%
um there were concerns raised by the
 
01:43:21.890 --> 01:43:21.900 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation and other
 
01:43:25.189 --> 01:43:25.199 align:start position:0%
concerns the bill needs some work but I
 
01:43:27.709 --> 01:43:27.719 align:start position:0%
want to be kayaking on my cyanobacteria
 
01:43:30.649 --> 01:43:30.659 align:start position:0%
Laden Lake this summer and I am going to
 
01:43:32.510 --> 01:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
vote against retention because I would
 
01:43:34.790 --> 01:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
like the sponsors of the bill working
 
01:43:37.250 --> 01:43:37.260 align:start position:0%
with the key stakeholders to come and
 
01:43:39.350 --> 01:43:39.360 align:start position:0%
bring another bill in the fall and I
 
01:43:40.970 --> 01:43:40.980 align:start position:0%
would be happy to put my name on that
 
01:43:45.350 --> 01:43:45.360 align:start position:0%
bill but I um just personally it's I
 
01:43:47.270 --> 01:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
don't like retained bills because it
 
01:43:49.850 --> 01:43:49.860 align:start position:0%
puts all the work on us when I think the
 
01:43:52.490 --> 01:43:52.500 align:start position:0%
when the bill sponsors are really
 
01:43:54.470 --> 01:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
motivated to see something like this I'd
 
01:43:57.410 --> 01:43:57.420 align:start position:0%
prefer if they do the leg work on it
 
01:43:58.910 --> 01:43:58.920 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to be voting against
 
01:44:02.510 --> 01:44:02.520 align:start position:0%
retention hoping that an itl motion will
 
01:44:06.109 --> 01:44:06.119 align:start position:0%
follow and urge the sponsors to come
 
01:44:08.149 --> 01:44:08.159 align:start position:0%
back in the fall with another an
 
01:44:13.070 --> 01:44:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:16.729 --> 01:44:16.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:20.209 --> 01:44:20.219 align:start position:0%
I just have uh one thing that I I the
 
01:44:24.350 --> 01:44:24.360 align:start position:0%
reason I will support this motion is I
 
01:44:26.330 --> 01:44:26.340 align:start position:0%
would like to find out what the law
 
01:44:30.050 --> 01:44:30.060 align:start position:0%
actually is around drones we have
 
01:44:31.750 --> 01:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:44:36.010 --> 01:44:36.020 align:start position:0%
faa's or say in transportation saying
 
01:44:40.729 --> 01:44:40.739 align:start position:0%
the federal government goes you know you
 
01:44:44.330 --> 01:44:44.340 align:start position:0%
can take control all the air space and
 
01:44:45.890 --> 01:44:45.900 align:start position:0%
then you have
 
01:44:49.870 --> 01:44:49.880 align:start position:0%
the uh you have uh the the
 
01:44:52.970 --> 01:44:52.980 align:start position:0%
Sparks people folks there they've got
 
01:44:59.030 --> 01:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
rules and uh uh concerning this bill I
 
01:45:01.850 --> 01:45:01.860 align:start position:0%
would like to have to have a retention
 
01:45:04.870 --> 01:45:04.880 align:start position:0%
so we can be able to
 
01:45:07.910 --> 01:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
ourselves know
 
01:45:09.950 --> 01:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
what the law is
 
01:45:13.430 --> 01:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
so that you know we we can all come to a
 
01:45:16.609 --> 01:45:16.619 align:start position:0%
come to some kind of agreement that
 
01:45:19.310 --> 01:45:19.320 align:start position:0%
this is this is what you can and can't
 
01:45:19.320 --> 01:45:20.629 align:start position:0%
this is this is what you can and can't
control

01:45:20.629 --> 01:45:20.639 align:start position:0%
control
 
01:45:22.970 --> 01:45:22.980 align:start position:0%
and that other than that that's why I
 
01:45:24.530 --> 01:45:24.540 align:start position:0%
will be voting for it
 
01:45:29.050 --> 01:45:29.060 align:start position:0%
I don't believe this bill will be uh
 
01:45:35.050 --> 01:45:35.060 align:start position:0%
will get a positive vote as is
 
01:45:39.470 --> 01:45:39.480 align:start position:0%
at the end of the uh of the
 
01:45:45.229 --> 01:45:45.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:48.590 --> 01:45:48.600 align:start position:0%
with that and he went
 
01:45:50.870 --> 01:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
representative Lamonte yeah I would just
 
01:45:53.810 --> 01:45:53.820 align:start position:0%
like to Second a representative rums
 
01:45:56.689 --> 01:45:56.699 align:start position:0%
runs comments about this
 
01:45:59.030 --> 01:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
um I think drones and
 
01:45:59.040 --> 01:45:59.770 align:start position:0%
um I think drones and
um

01:45:59.770 --> 01:45:59.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:02.629 --> 01:46:02.639 align:start position:0%
uavs are certainly something of the
 
01:46:02.639 --> 01:46:04.209 align:start position:0%
uavs are certainly something of the
future

01:46:04.209 --> 01:46:04.219 align:start position:0%
future
 
01:46:06.590 --> 01:46:06.600 align:start position:0%
throughout our whole society we're going
 
01:46:08.629 --> 01:46:08.639 align:start position:0%
to see more and more of them but I don't
 
01:46:10.669 --> 01:46:10.679 align:start position:0%
feel like as resources committee it's
 
01:46:13.189 --> 01:46:13.199 align:start position:0%
our job to try to figure out the whole
 
01:46:15.649 --> 01:46:15.659 align:start position:0%
big picture about that I think we're
 
01:46:17.689 --> 01:46:17.699 align:start position:0%
here to protect the interests of the
 
01:46:20.810 --> 01:46:20.820 align:start position:0%
state park and the um
 
01:46:23.149 --> 01:46:23.159 align:start position:0%
the director of the park Association
 
01:46:26.149 --> 01:46:26.159 align:start position:0%
wanted to see it not pass as opposed to
 
01:46:28.250 --> 01:46:28.260 align:start position:0%
it and
 
01:46:28.260 --> 01:46:29.330 align:start position:0%
it and
um

01:46:29.330 --> 01:46:29.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:31.129 --> 01:46:31.139 align:start position:0%
I think we need to look out for the
 
01:46:32.689 --> 01:46:32.699 align:start position:0%
interests of
 
01:46:36.050 --> 01:46:36.060 align:start position:0%
that we can all enjoy the state park as
 
01:46:38.930 --> 01:46:38.940 align:start position:0%
it is so I would be in favor of killing
 
01:46:39.770 --> 01:46:39.780 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:46:44.930 --> 01:46:44.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:47.750 --> 01:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
the chair excuse me the vice chair
 
01:46:50.709 --> 01:46:50.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:56.990 --> 01:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:00.350 --> 01:47:00.360 align:start position:0%
that's right here and you can learn the
 
01:47:04.609 --> 01:47:04.619 align:start position:0%
uh Vice chair has reminded me that uh if
 
01:47:09.350 --> 01:47:09.360 align:start position:0%
you if we hear if we uh retain the bill
 
01:47:13.790 --> 01:47:13.800 align:start position:0%
uh the that kind of prevents the bill
 
01:47:16.790 --> 01:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
from returning next session
 
01:47:19.370 --> 01:47:19.380 align:start position:0%
however if we don't retain
 
01:47:22.070 --> 01:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
the bill it can be brought back the next
 
01:47:24.169 --> 01:47:24.179 align:start position:0%
session so
 
01:47:26.689 --> 01:47:26.699 align:start position:0%
you may be hearing it again
 
01:47:29.810 --> 01:47:29.820 align:start position:0%
I'd say but anyway that's a that is an
 
01:47:33.050 --> 01:47:33.060 align:start position:0%
artifact of what of how how the system
 
01:47:33.060 --> 01:47:36.229 align:start position:0%
artifact of what of how how the system
operates

01:47:36.229 --> 01:47:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:39.169 --> 01:47:39.179 align:start position:0%
but that is any other question any other
 
01:47:42.890 --> 01:47:42.900 align:start position:0%
comments any other questions if not
 
01:47:47.590 --> 01:47:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:47.600 --> 01:47:49.370 align:start position:0%
 
434

01:47:49.370 --> 01:47:49.380 align:start position:0%
434
 
01:47:52.550 --> 01:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
and a motion to retain will be

okay with
 
01:49:17.629 --> 01:49:17.639 align:start position:0%
no that's right I believe we still have
 
01:49:20.330 --> 01:49:20.340 align:start position:0%
four other early bills Mr chair we
 
01:49:23.090 --> 01:49:23.100 align:start position:0%
skipped over 247 the one about the well
 
01:49:23.100 --> 01:49:24.410 align:start position:0%
skipped over 247 the one about the well
radii

01:49:24.410 --> 01:49:24.420 align:start position:0%
radii
 
01:49:26.810 --> 01:49:26.820 align:start position:0%
that's not an early bill
 
01:49:29.270 --> 01:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
Oh I thought FN bills were I'm sorry no
 
01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:30.490 align:start position:0%
Oh I thought FN bills were I'm sorry no
well

01:49:30.490 --> 01:49:30.500 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:49:33.169 --> 01:49:33.179 align:start position:0%
sometimes if they're less than a certain
 
01:49:33.179 --> 01:49:34.129 align:start position:0%
sometimes if they're less than a certain
amount

01:49:34.129 --> 01:49:34.139 align:start position:0%
amount
 
01:49:37.910 --> 01:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
oh okay but uh you know just to be just
 
01:49:40.030 --> 01:49:40.040 align:start position:0%
to be certain
 
01:49:43.729 --> 01:49:43.739 align:start position:0%
it says March 16th all right
 
01:49:46.250 --> 01:49:46.260 align:start position:0%
yeah the only way only early bills are
 
01:49:51.530 --> 01:49:51.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:54.290 --> 01:49:54.300 align:start position:0%
the only the other one the last of the
 
01:50:00.830 --> 01:50:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:00.840 --> 01:50:01.750 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:50:01.750 --> 01:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:50:11.750 --> 01:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:15.050 --> 01:50:15.060 align:start position:0%
open the hearing and open the executive
 
01:50:20.450 --> 01:50:20.460 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill 534 FN relative to
 
01:50:36.229 --> 01:50:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:38.390 --> 01:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
care records that recognizes
 
01:50:43.010 --> 01:50:43.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:44.870 --> 01:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
01:50:48.669 --> 01:50:48.679 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to make a motion to retain
 
01:50:52.609 --> 01:50:52.619 align:start position:0%
this spill and
 
01:50:57.430 --> 01:50:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:59.810 --> 01:50:59.820 align:start position:0%
I'll suck on that Mr chairman okay
 
01:51:06.470 --> 01:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:09.890 --> 01:51:09.900 align:start position:0%
oh do you want me to speak oh yes okay
 
01:51:09.900 --> 01:51:10.850 align:start position:0%
oh do you want me to speak oh yes okay
um

01:51:10.850 --> 01:51:10.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:14.629 --> 01:51:14.639 align:start position:0%
that my concern is that this bill is an
 
01:51:16.790 --> 01:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
expansion of the water assistance for
 
01:51:19.129 --> 01:51:19.139 align:start position:0%
natural disaster impacts to low-income
 
01:51:22.010 --> 01:51:22.020 align:start position:0%
residential well owners
 
01:51:26.450 --> 01:51:26.460 align:start position:0%
um which was a fund um that is or was in
 
01:51:29.689 --> 01:51:29.699 align:start position:0%
existence uh with the es
 
01:51:32.810 --> 01:51:32.820 align:start position:0%
um the part that it is expands it as it
 
01:51:36.830 --> 01:51:36.840 align:start position:0%
was this wand fund as it's called
 
01:51:40.189 --> 01:51:40.199 align:start position:0%
um use was applying to applicable to
 
01:51:44.990 --> 01:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
extreme weather events and this uh new
 
01:51:48.890 --> 01:51:48.900 align:start position:0%
house bill uh is applying to any dry
 
01:51:51.649 --> 01:51:51.659 align:start position:0%
well so I just have concerns that it's
 
01:51:53.990 --> 01:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
an expansion of
 
01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:55.250 align:start position:0%
an expansion of
the

01:51:55.250 --> 01:51:55.260 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:51:58.910 --> 01:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:03.189 --> 01:52:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:05.689 --> 01:52:05.699 align:start position:0%
representative harp you wish to speak to
 
01:52:08.390 --> 01:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
the uh speak to the motion
 
01:52:10.129 --> 01:52:10.139 align:start position:0%
I wanted to confirm I'm in agreement
 
01:52:12.109 --> 01:52:12.119 align:start position:0%
with a representative of Howard Boyle
 
01:52:14.390 --> 01:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:52:16.570 --> 01:52:16.580 align:start position:0%
any else anyone else wish to speak
 
01:52:25.669 --> 01:52:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:28.189 --> 01:52:28.199 align:start position:0%
I won't be voting against the motion to
 
01:52:30.530 --> 01:52:30.540 align:start position:0%
retain in order to bring another motion
 
01:52:30.540 --> 01:52:32.030 align:start position:0%
retain in order to bring another motion
forward

01:52:32.030 --> 01:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:52:34.070 --> 01:52:34.080 align:start position:0%
um if that one should fail and that's
 
01:52:37.129 --> 01:52:37.139 align:start position:0%
because this bill is a critical bill for
 
01:52:39.410 --> 01:52:39.420 align:start position:0%
people who are having difficulty with
 
01:52:41.870 --> 01:52:41.880 align:start position:0%
their water and it is important to
 
01:52:44.330 --> 01:52:44.340 align:start position:0%
address the fact that there are drought
 
01:52:46.609 --> 01:52:46.619 align:start position:0%
elated and water emergencies happening
 
01:52:48.350 --> 01:52:48.360 align:start position:0%
all over the state and as you can see
 
01:52:50.870 --> 01:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
the result is that from the droughts is
 
01:52:54.169 --> 01:52:54.179 align:start position:0%
that we have all types of problems with
 
01:52:54.179 --> 01:52:56.990 align:start position:0%
that we have all types of problems with
um

01:52:56.990 --> 01:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:59.450 --> 01:52:59.460 align:start position:0%
invasive species and with what can be
 
01:53:02.510 --> 01:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
going on with your well I sat with some
 
01:53:05.870 --> 01:53:05.880 align:start position:0%
folks last summer who are legislators
 
01:53:08.990 --> 01:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
and when we were talking about
 
01:53:10.850 --> 01:53:10.860 align:start position:0%
um what's being going on during the
 
01:53:12.290 --> 01:53:12.300 align:start position:0%
drought how it's been such a beautiful
 
01:53:16.430 --> 01:53:16.440 align:start position:0%
summer and we hadn't had any rain yet we
 
01:53:18.649 --> 01:53:18.659 align:start position:0%
began to talk about who's well ran dry
 
01:53:21.229 --> 01:53:21.239 align:start position:0%
and who was getting mud coming up
 
01:53:23.570 --> 01:53:23.580 align:start position:0%
through the pump so I think that we
 
01:53:25.669 --> 01:53:25.679 align:start position:0%
really need to consider what happens to
 
01:53:27.410 --> 01:53:27.420 align:start position:0%
people when they have this kind of an
 
01:53:29.870 --> 01:53:29.880 align:start position:0%
emergency it really destroys the value
 
01:53:32.990 --> 01:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
of the property and I would like us to
 
01:53:37.790 --> 01:53:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:40.490 --> 01:53:40.500 align:start position:0%
representative wrong for thank you Mr
 
01:53:40.500 --> 01:53:41.570 align:start position:0%
representative wrong for thank you Mr
chair

01:53:41.570 --> 01:53:41.580 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:53:43.070 --> 01:53:43.080 align:start position:0%
um I'm a little bit confused
 
01:53:44.990 --> 01:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
representative Harvey bolio your
 
01:53:46.910 --> 01:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
comments when you spoke to your motion
 
01:53:49.010 --> 01:53:49.020 align:start position:0%
because throughout this bill it talks
 
01:53:52.970 --> 01:53:52.980 align:start position:0%
about a result of damage to Wells as a
 
01:53:56.149 --> 01:53:56.159 align:start position:0%
result of a natural disaster
 
01:53:56.159 --> 01:53:57.290 align:start position:0%
result of a natural disaster
um

01:53:57.290 --> 01:53:57.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:59.390 --> 01:53:59.400 align:start position:0%
so it has to be a natural disaster in
 
01:54:02.930 --> 01:54:02.940 align:start position:0%
order for someone to qualify for funds
 
01:54:04.669 --> 01:54:04.679 align:start position:0%
you know as well as I think there's an
 
01:54:08.270 --> 01:54:08.280 align:start position:0%
income component to it as well so if
 
01:54:10.729 --> 01:54:10.739 align:start position:0%
somebody's will just runs dry but it's
 
01:54:13.310 --> 01:54:13.320 align:start position:0%
not a result of a natural disaster they
 
01:54:16.370 --> 01:54:16.380 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be eligible for this funding am
 
01:54:18.350 --> 01:54:18.360 align:start position:0%
I misreading something
 
01:54:21.290 --> 01:54:21.300 align:start position:0%
and particularly noting the
 
01:54:24.290 --> 01:54:24.300 align:start position:0%
um on line five of page
 
01:54:27.790 --> 01:54:27.800 align:start position:0%
two or the page one I'm sorry line five
 
01:54:30.709 --> 01:54:30.719 align:start position:0%
it the purpose statement mentions
 
01:54:33.770 --> 01:54:33.780 align:start position:0%
natural disasters throughout it and also
 
01:54:36.350 --> 01:54:36.360 align:start position:0%
the appropriation on page two line five
 
01:54:38.209 --> 01:54:38.219 align:start position:0%
talks about that it's a natural
 
01:54:40.490 --> 01:54:40.500 align:start position:0%
disasters fund and that's where the
 
01:54:42.169 --> 01:54:42.179 align:start position:0%
Appropriations coming
 
01:54:44.450 --> 01:54:44.460 align:start position:0%
so if someone just has a well that runs
 
01:54:46.910 --> 01:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
dry this wouldn't this wouldn't apply to
 
01:54:48.050 --> 01:54:48.060 align:start position:0%
them but I don't know if I'm missing
 
01:54:48.060 --> 01:54:49.669 align:start position:0%
them but I don't know if I'm missing
something

01:54:49.669 --> 01:54:49.679 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:54:54.229 --> 01:54:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:55.910 --> 01:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
01:54:57.709 --> 01:54:57.719 align:start position:0%
representative Ron
 
01:54:59.810 --> 01:54:59.820 align:start position:0%
um I I believe it came out in the
 
01:55:02.149 --> 01:55:02.159 align:start position:0%
hearing that it applies to any dry well
 
01:55:04.550 --> 01:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
uh it does say
 
01:55:07.010 --> 01:55:07.020 align:start position:0%
other acts of God which is
 
01:55:10.370 --> 01:55:10.380 align:start position:0%
um on line six which is
 
01:55:13.970 --> 01:55:13.980 align:start position:0%
fairly open to interpretation
 
01:55:16.609 --> 01:55:16.619 align:start position:0%
um so that is where I took that
 
01:55:16.619 --> 01:55:17.209 align:start position:0%
um so that is where I took that
um

01:55:17.209 --> 01:55:17.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:19.430 --> 01:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
and there's we also mentioned in
 
01:55:21.770 --> 01:55:21.780 align:start position:0%
committee I thought that natural
 
01:55:24.890 --> 01:55:24.900 align:start position:0%
disasters is not defined
 
01:55:24.900 --> 01:55:26.330 align:start position:0%
disasters is not defined
no

01:55:26.330 --> 01:55:26.340 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:55:26.340 --> 01:55:27.530 align:start position:0%
no
um

01:55:27.530 --> 01:55:27.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:29.930 --> 01:55:29.940 align:start position:0%
in a second Point
 
01:55:31.970 --> 01:55:31.980 align:start position:0%
um if I may is uh
 
01:55:35.270 --> 01:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
you know why why are we limiting this
 
01:55:38.030 --> 01:55:38.040 align:start position:0%
fund to just
 
01:55:40.129 --> 01:55:40.139 align:start position:0%
um for just people who have problems
 
01:55:43.609 --> 01:55:43.619 align:start position:0%
with droughts and dry Wells when there
 
01:55:46.430 --> 01:55:46.440 align:start position:0%
are lots of other people who have on not
 
01:55:50.090 --> 01:55:50.100 align:start position:0%
non-potable water drinking water uh due
 
01:55:54.770 --> 01:55:54.780 align:start position:0%
to too much rust or other contaminants
 
01:55:54.780 --> 01:55:56.330 align:start position:0%
to too much rust or other contaminants
um

01:55:56.330 --> 01:55:56.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:59.090 --> 01:55:59.100 align:start position:0%
or just uh problems there's a variety of
 
01:56:00.229 --> 01:56:00.239 align:start position:0%
problems I'm not really familiar with
 
01:56:02.810 --> 01:56:02.820 align:start position:0%
them but I I do know um for instance in
 
01:56:04.790 --> 01:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
my neighborhood that the water's not
 
01:56:07.250 --> 01:56:07.260 align:start position:0%
drinkable because of rust so I'm not
 
01:56:09.770 --> 01:56:09.780 align:start position:0%
sure why it's limited just the dry Wells
 
01:56:14.990 --> 01:56:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:16.790 --> 01:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
representative wolf did you have your
 
01:56:18.890 --> 01:56:18.900 align:start position:0%
paint well if you shut set your
 
01:56:21.649 --> 01:56:21.659 align:start position:0%
microphone off please
 
01:56:23.209 --> 01:56:23.219 align:start position:0%
that's off
 
01:56:25.189 --> 01:56:25.199 align:start position:0%
representative representative Darby
 
01:56:26.990 --> 01:56:27.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:56:30.109 --> 01:56:30.119 align:start position:0%
um just a couple of points on line uh 28
 
01:56:32.270 --> 01:56:32.280 align:start position:0%
of the first page which which is
 
01:56:34.250 --> 01:56:34.260 align:start position:0%
actually the um you know the
 
01:56:35.930 --> 01:56:35.940 align:start position:0%
specification of the rule not the
 
01:56:37.910 --> 01:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
purpose statement it specifically States
 
01:56:40.609 --> 01:56:40.619 align:start position:0%
you know natural disaster conditions and
 
01:56:43.070 --> 01:56:43.080 align:start position:0%
conditions and locations are what are
 
01:56:45.410 --> 01:56:45.420 align:start position:0%
going to be taken into account based on
 
01:56:47.149 --> 01:56:47.159 align:start position:0%
the fund there's
 
01:56:50.510 --> 01:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
um uh sorry based on this fund
 
01:56:52.609 --> 01:56:52.619 align:start position:0%
um yes natural disaster conditions and
 
01:56:54.290 --> 01:56:54.300 align:start position:0%
locations have to be defined by the
 
01:56:56.930 --> 01:56:56.940 align:start position:0%
rules the um you know subpart 3 there
 
01:56:59.390 --> 01:56:59.400 align:start position:0%
says that thick the commissioner has to
 
01:57:01.669 --> 01:57:01.679 align:start position:0%
adopt the rules but that those rules
 
01:57:04.850 --> 01:57:04.860 align:start position:0%
will be developed in an open Forum um
 
01:57:07.550 --> 01:57:07.560 align:start position:0%
with that will allow for discussion
 
01:57:09.590 --> 01:57:09.600 align:start position:0%
a couple of other points I'd like to um
 
01:57:13.490 --> 01:57:13.500 align:start position:0%
to make is what I recall during the
 
01:57:15.290 --> 01:57:15.300 align:start position:0%
testimony is that the fun the current
 
01:57:15.300 --> 01:57:16.550 align:start position:0%
testimony is that the fun the current
funds

01:57:16.550 --> 01:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:57:18.350 --> 01:57:18.360 align:start position:0%
um so so first off we should we should
 
01:57:19.729 --> 01:57:19.739 align:start position:0%
be talking about you know who are the
 
01:57:21.589 --> 01:57:21.599 align:start position:0%
people involved here the people involved
 
01:57:23.930 --> 01:57:23.940 align:start position:0%
are you know the people that if they
 
01:57:26.030 --> 01:57:26.040 align:start position:0%
lose their Wells if they if they can't
 
01:57:27.229 --> 01:57:27.239 align:start position:0%
um they can't drink out of their tax
 
01:57:29.810 --> 01:57:29.820 align:start position:0%
anymore they're they're um they're
 
01:57:32.270 --> 01:57:32.280 align:start position:0%
beyond desperate um they they don't have
 
01:57:34.550 --> 01:57:34.560 align:start position:0%
other options they're going to we heard
 
01:57:36.770 --> 01:57:36.780 align:start position:0%
some testimony that suggested they might
 
01:57:38.750 --> 01:57:38.760 align:start position:0%
you know have to relocate to
 
01:57:40.669 --> 01:57:40.679 align:start position:0%
um more urban areas
 
01:57:43.669 --> 01:57:43.679 align:start position:0%
um we also heard I recall that the this
 
01:57:46.609 --> 01:57:46.619 align:start position:0%
is sort of a continuation of an existing
 
01:57:49.010 --> 01:57:49.020 align:start position:0%
program that was bestowed by a by a
 
01:57:50.390 --> 01:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
trust fund and those funds are used up
 
01:57:52.790 --> 01:57:52.800 align:start position:0%
so if we don't pass this now what's
 
01:57:54.830 --> 01:57:54.840 align:start position:0%
going to happen if we if we retain this
 
01:57:56.990 --> 01:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
right even for a year there's going to
 
01:57:59.390 --> 01:57:59.400 align:start position:0%
be a year gap before um before these
 
01:58:01.010 --> 01:58:01.020 align:start position:0%
funds are available again during that
 
01:58:03.470 --> 01:58:03.480 align:start position:0%
year Gap these what I would say is
 
01:58:05.689 --> 01:58:05.699 align:start position:0%
desperate people are you know are going
 
01:58:07.490 --> 01:58:07.500 align:start position:0%
to go without the last three years we
 
01:58:09.709 --> 01:58:09.719 align:start position:0%
heard the last three years we've had
 
01:58:12.950 --> 01:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
serious drought conditions and we don't
 
01:58:14.510 --> 01:58:14.520 align:start position:0%
um and we also heard we don't know what
 
01:58:16.250 --> 01:58:16.260 align:start position:0%
the conditions are going to be uh going
 
01:58:18.169 --> 01:58:18.179 align:start position:0%
into next year
 
01:58:21.169 --> 01:58:21.179 align:start position:0%
um we uh
 
01:58:24.169 --> 01:58:24.179 align:start position:0%
um we also heard that there's no um you
 
01:58:25.370 --> 01:58:25.380 align:start position:0%
know we
 
01:58:28.550 --> 01:58:28.560 align:start position:0%
the rules state that the availability to
 
01:58:28.560 --> 01:58:29.629 align:start position:0%
the rules state that the availability to
um

01:58:29.629 --> 01:58:29.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:31.850 --> 01:58:31.860 align:start position:0%
support this for the people that are
 
01:58:33.709 --> 01:58:33.719 align:start position:0%
apply to support it has to be taken to
 
01:58:35.450 --> 01:58:35.460 align:start position:0%
into account and that there's no other
 
01:58:38.510 --> 01:58:38.520 align:start position:0%
sources femur acts even if FEMA even if
 
01:58:40.810 --> 01:58:40.820 align:start position:0%
the um uh even if the federal government
 
01:58:44.330 --> 01:58:44.340 align:start position:0%
declares and um not a natural disaster
 
01:58:47.209 --> 01:58:47.219 align:start position:0%
uh the FEMA funds come in too late
 
01:58:48.830 --> 01:58:48.840 align:start position:0%
um we heard that it's extremely
 
01:58:51.589 --> 01:58:51.599 align:start position:0%
expensive to get an emergency well
 
01:58:54.830 --> 01:58:54.840 align:start position:0%
drilled drilled and lastly I'll say that
 
01:58:56.270 --> 01:58:56.280 align:start position:0%
um you know we heard Municipal support
 
01:58:58.010 --> 01:58:58.020 align:start position:0%
because where do people reach out first
 
01:58:59.810 --> 01:58:59.820 align:start position:0%
they're reaching out to the towns the
 
01:59:02.089 --> 01:59:02.099 align:start position:0%
towns are reaching out to the state if
 
01:59:03.410 --> 01:59:03.420 align:start position:0%
there's not a program like this
 
01:59:03.420 --> 01:59:04.490 align:start position:0%
there's not a program like this
available

01:59:04.490 --> 01:59:04.500 align:start position:0%
available
 
01:59:06.890 --> 01:59:06.900 align:start position:0%
um that you know it it this the
 
01:59:09.109 --> 01:59:09.119 align:start position:0%
suffering will be all the way down so I
 
01:59:11.030 --> 01:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
I very much
 
01:59:13.370 --> 01:59:13.380 align:start position:0%
um uh am opposed to retaining this Bill
 
01:59:16.550 --> 01:59:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:19.729 --> 01:59:19.739 align:start position:0%
anyone else switch to speak on the
 
01:59:19.739 --> 01:59:24.709 align:start position:0%
anyone else switch to speak on the
motion

01:59:24.709 --> 01:59:24.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:26.870 --> 01:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
I guess I should put my two cents worth
 
01:59:30.709 --> 01:59:30.719 align:start position:0%
in why not Scrooge Rides Again
 
01:59:35.209 --> 01:59:35.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:38.209 --> 01:59:38.219 align:start position:0%
at what point
 
01:59:38.219 --> 01:59:39.410 align:start position:0%
at what point
does

01:59:39.410 --> 01:59:39.420 align:start position:0%
does
 
01:59:41.870 --> 01:59:41.880 align:start position:0%
People Are People responsible for
 
01:59:41.880 --> 01:59:43.970 align:start position:0%
People Are People responsible for
themselves

01:59:43.970 --> 01:59:43.980 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
01:59:47.870 --> 01:59:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:51.350 --> 01:59:51.360 align:start position:0%
a well runs dry because the temperature
 
01:59:54.229 --> 01:59:54.239 align:start position:0%
is too high
 
01:59:55.609 --> 01:59:55.619 align:start position:0%
you can
 
01:59:57.109 --> 01:59:57.119 align:start position:0%
you'll get
 
01:59:59.750 --> 01:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
you'll get in these things and
 
02:00:02.510 --> 02:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
the grass dies you can get a well
 
02:00:05.270 --> 02:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
drilled which means you've yet it's not
 
02:00:08.830 --> 02:00:08.840 align:start position:0%
just get getting getting
 
02:00:12.770 --> 02:00:12.780 align:start position:0%
subsistence stuff subsistence that's
 
02:00:16.209 --> 02:00:16.219 align:start position:0%
getting some Capital Money
 
02:00:20.149 --> 02:00:20.159 align:start position:0%
significant money to build to drill for
 
02:00:20.159 --> 02:00:22.310 align:start position:0%
significant money to build to drill for
wealth

02:00:22.310 --> 02:00:22.320 align:start position:0%
wealth
 
02:00:24.890 --> 02:00:24.900 align:start position:0%
sooner or later
 
02:00:28.250 --> 02:00:28.260 align:start position:0%
people have to learn that they have to
 
02:00:28.260 --> 02:00:29.810 align:start position:0%
people have to learn that they have to
live

02:00:29.810 --> 02:00:29.820 align:start position:0%
live
 
02:00:33.109 --> 02:00:33.119 align:start position:0%
you know on their their under under
 
02:00:35.330 --> 02:00:35.340 align:start position:0%
their own
 
02:00:35.340 --> 02:00:36.830 align:start position:0%
their own
uh

02:00:36.830 --> 02:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:00:39.709 --> 02:00:39.719 align:start position:0%
by themselves live they're not I should
 
02:00:42.109 --> 02:00:42.119 align:start position:0%
not be considered
 
02:00:42.119 --> 02:00:44.930 align:start position:0%
not be considered
getting

02:00:44.930 --> 02:00:44.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:44.940 --> 02:00:47.870 align:start position:0%
 
charities

02:00:47.870 --> 02:00:47.880 align:start position:0%
charities
 
02:00:50.870 --> 02:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
not from the state the state
 
02:00:55.729 --> 02:00:55.739 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:59.570 --> 02:00:59.580 align:start position:0%
and this this is a significant Capital
 
02:01:02.689 --> 02:01:02.699 align:start position:0%
Improvement I had no problem if the
 
02:01:04.070 --> 02:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
state giving
 
02:01:07.310 --> 02:01:07.320 align:start position:0%
maybe low interest loans
 
02:01:10.250 --> 02:01:10.260 align:start position:0%
even a no interest loan provided the
 
02:01:13.310 --> 02:01:13.320 align:start position:0%
money is paid back
 
02:01:16.010 --> 02:01:16.020 align:start position:0%
or simply maybe even put on their
 
02:01:16.020 --> 02:01:18.609 align:start position:0%
or simply maybe even put on their
mortgage

02:01:18.609 --> 02:01:18.619 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:23.570 --> 02:01:23.580 align:start position:0%
to be able to have the state recover the
 
02:01:25.550 --> 02:01:25.560 align:start position:0%
people's money
 
02:01:27.050 --> 02:01:27.060 align:start position:0%
I mean we
 
02:01:31.330 --> 02:01:31.340 align:start position:0%
we seem to be getting into a
 
02:01:33.770 --> 02:01:33.780 align:start position:0%
situation where
 
02:01:35.990 --> 02:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
the state is the is the insurance
 
02:01:38.270 --> 02:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
company for everyone
 
02:01:40.250 --> 02:01:40.260 align:start position:0%
and we can't be we just don't have
 
02:01:43.189 --> 02:01:43.199 align:start position:0%
enough enough to do it
 
02:01:47.750 --> 02:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
so I would I I could I could see
 
02:01:49.790 --> 02:01:49.800 align:start position:0%
reworking this bill
 
02:01:51.530 --> 02:01:51.540 align:start position:0%
to be able to
 
02:01:51.540 --> 02:01:52.970 align:start position:0%
to be able to
have

02:01:52.970 --> 02:01:52.980 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:01:55.310 --> 02:01:55.320 align:start position:0%
the people who are getting
 
02:01:55.320 --> 02:01:56.229 align:start position:0%
the people who are getting
a

02:01:56.229 --> 02:01:56.239 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:02:00.109 --> 02:02:00.119 align:start position:0%
substantial Grant singly by the just
 
02:02:02.149 --> 02:02:02.159 align:start position:0%
that one home
 
02:02:04.510 --> 02:02:04.520 align:start position:0%
it costs some money to
 
02:02:06.950 --> 02:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
drill well and
 
02:02:09.470 --> 02:02:09.480 align:start position:0%
it's not cheap
 
02:02:12.530 --> 02:02:12.540 align:start position:0%
that they would have at least
 
02:02:17.030 --> 02:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
the responsibility to be able to
 
02:02:18.890 --> 02:02:18.900 align:start position:0%
pay back the loan
 
02:02:22.370 --> 02:02:22.380 align:start position:0%
or even if you you pay back the loan on
 
02:02:27.410 --> 02:02:27.420 align:start position:0%
uh as having this the states
 
02:02:31.430 --> 02:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
money the the state's obligation or the
 
02:02:34.010 --> 02:02:34.020 align:start position:0%
the or their obligation to the state
 
02:02:36.709 --> 02:02:36.719 align:start position:0%
take preference over even their their
 
02:02:39.290 --> 02:02:39.300 align:start position:0%
mortgage I don't mind I don't I would go
 
02:02:40.490 --> 02:02:40.500 align:start position:0%
that far
 
02:02:43.570 --> 02:02:43.580 align:start position:0%
but I'm not so certain I want to go the
 
02:02:47.750 --> 02:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
this this this this this file
 
02:02:52.490 --> 02:02:52.500 align:start position:0%

you're you're fast
 
02:04:30.950 --> 02:04:30.960 align:start position:0%

yeah tell a second okay Darby
 
02:04:36.770 --> 02:04:36.780 align:start position:0%
thank you wish to speak to your motion
 
02:04:40.729 --> 02:04:40.739 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chair thank you um
 
02:04:43.609 --> 02:04:43.619 align:start position:0%
I think to keep it simple that we need
 
02:04:46.070 --> 02:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
to know the true costs of a drought for
 
02:04:49.129 --> 02:04:49.139 align:start position:0%
an individual who is a homeowner and for
 
02:04:51.229 --> 02:04:51.239 align:start position:0%
other natural disasters that happen
 
02:04:55.550 --> 02:04:55.560 align:start position:0%
where your house becomes uninhabitable
 
02:04:56.990 --> 02:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
um and we have to think about the
 
02:04:58.550 --> 02:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
thousands and thousands of dollars that
 
02:05:00.350 --> 02:05:00.360 align:start position:0%
people have to pay and when they're
 
02:05:02.450 --> 02:05:02.460 align:start position:0%
competing for a driller
 
02:05:05.510 --> 02:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
in an emergency basis to put them in a
 
02:05:06.410 --> 02:05:06.420 align:start position:0%
new well
 
02:05:08.930 --> 02:05:08.940 align:start position:0%
and we have to be just like I said again
 
02:05:10.669 --> 02:05:10.679 align:start position:0%
we have to think about what happened
 
02:05:13.729 --> 02:05:13.739 align:start position:0%
last summer and how that affected so
 
02:05:16.910 --> 02:05:16.920 align:start position:0%
many of the economic
 
02:05:18.649 --> 02:05:18.659 align:start position:0%
things that happen in our state that
 
02:05:21.410 --> 02:05:21.420 align:start position:0%
rely on water and an abundance of it and
 
02:05:23.330 --> 02:05:23.340 align:start position:0%
this is one of those bills that will
 
02:05:26.570 --> 02:05:26.580 align:start position:0%
help people to keep potable water in
 
02:05:27.830 --> 02:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
their homes
 
02:05:30.109 --> 02:05:30.119 align:start position:0%
in the event of an emergency thank you
 
02:05:33.050 --> 02:05:33.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:35.870 --> 02:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
you wish to speak to your second yes
 
02:05:37.970 --> 02:05:37.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman a couple more
 
02:05:39.649 --> 02:05:39.659 align:start position:0%
points that I'd like to make
 
02:05:43.189 --> 02:05:43.199 align:start position:0%
I'm first I um I took a gander again at
 
02:05:45.410 --> 02:05:45.420 align:start position:0%
the State Constitution yesterday last
 
02:05:48.350 --> 02:05:48.360 align:start position:0%
night and I was uh reminded of article 3
 
02:05:50.870 --> 02:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
which says one of the key things behind
 
02:05:55.250 --> 02:05:55.260 align:start position:0%
that we do as a as a society is to help
 
02:05:57.290 --> 02:05:57.300 align:start position:0%
those in need and this clearly meets
 
02:05:59.390 --> 02:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
that definition
 
02:06:03.530 --> 02:06:03.540 align:start position:0%
um I'd also like to mention that
 
02:06:06.649 --> 02:06:06.659 align:start position:0%
um the um the bill talks about a
 
02:06:08.149 --> 02:06:08.159 align:start position:0%
continually appropriated fund because
 
02:06:10.609 --> 02:06:10.619 align:start position:0%
this is expected to be an ongoing
 
02:06:13.490 --> 02:06:13.500 align:start position:0%
problem I specifically asked about the
 
02:06:15.950 --> 02:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
um the funding needed that was
 
02:06:18.850 --> 02:06:18.860 align:start position:0%
appropriated in this versus
 
02:06:22.250 --> 02:06:22.260 align:start position:0%
used by the trust fund and what we heard
 
02:06:23.450 --> 02:06:23.460 align:start position:0%
is that
 
02:06:27.109 --> 02:06:27.119 align:start position:0%
um they they need to have this much
 
02:06:30.169 --> 02:06:30.179 align:start position:0%
funding up front to account for
 
02:06:32.209 --> 02:06:32.219 align:start position:0%
um basically the unknowns that might
 
02:06:35.810 --> 02:06:35.820 align:start position:0%
happen but they don't expect uh it to be
 
02:06:38.089 --> 02:06:38.099 align:start position:0%
2.5 million a year over the last two
 
02:06:40.310 --> 02:06:40.320 align:start position:0%
years they only spent 2.5 million total
 
02:06:43.729 --> 02:06:43.739 align:start position:0%
so the um the the amount appropriated
 
02:06:46.250 --> 02:06:46.260 align:start position:0%
here over two years which I I believe is
 
02:06:50.089 --> 02:06:50.099 align:start position:0%
5 million is not to be expected I would
 
02:06:51.709 --> 02:06:51.719 align:start position:0%
um anticipate would not be expected
 
02:06:53.990 --> 02:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
moving forward
 
02:06:56.390 --> 02:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
um uh and
 
02:06:58.430 --> 02:06:58.440 align:start position:0%
um the last thing I'd mentioned is that
 
02:07:01.430 --> 02:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
the bill itself is a bipartisan bill
 
02:07:03.709 --> 02:07:03.719 align:start position:0%
um including um our representative our
 
02:07:04.850 --> 02:07:04.860 align:start position:0%
own representative Gould who
 
02:07:07.070 --> 02:07:07.080 align:start position:0%
unfortunately couldn't be here today
 
02:07:08.689 --> 02:07:08.699 align:start position:0%
um so this is not uh this is not a
 
02:07:10.550 --> 02:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
partisan issue this has got bipartisan
 
02:07:12.470 --> 02:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
support we want to help the members of
 
02:07:14.990 --> 02:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
our state and I'd urge you to uh vote to
 
02:07:17.689 --> 02:07:17.699 align:start position:0%
pass on this thank you
 
02:07:20.990 --> 02:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
representative rock thank you Mr chair
 
02:07:23.089 --> 02:07:23.099 align:start position:0%
um I want to Echo what my colleague from
 
02:07:25.370 --> 02:07:25.380 align:start position:0%
Nashua said about the bipartisanship of
 
02:07:27.709 --> 02:07:27.719 align:start position:0%
this bill I mean the prime sponsor is a
 
02:07:29.810 --> 02:07:29.820 align:start position:0%
another colleague of mine from Merrimack
 
02:07:33.109 --> 02:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
and we see a colleague from
 
02:07:37.070 --> 02:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
um Bedford and and Senate support for
 
02:07:39.589 --> 02:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
this and I think what's important of
 
02:07:40.970 --> 02:07:40.980 align:start position:0%
this is
 
02:07:45.109 --> 02:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
um if these Wells don't get addressed
 
02:07:46.790 --> 02:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
um when there's an unexpected natural
 
02:07:49.250 --> 02:07:49.260 align:start position:0%
disaster it's going to hurt the property
 
02:07:52.010 --> 02:07:52.020 align:start position:0%
value and we saw with testimony from the
 
02:07:53.990 --> 02:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Municipal Association how
 
02:07:56.570 --> 02:07:56.580 align:start position:0%
important it is to have this program to
 
02:07:58.970 --> 02:07:58.980 align:start position:0%
continue this program in order just to
 
02:08:01.790 --> 02:08:01.800 align:start position:0%
maintain the property values and thus
 
02:08:03.770 --> 02:08:03.780 align:start position:0%
the property tax is paid by that
 
02:08:06.109 --> 02:08:06.119 align:start position:0%
property because if if someone is low
 
02:08:10.189 --> 02:08:10.199 align:start position:0%
income and they their well is ruined or
 
02:08:11.810 --> 02:08:11.820 align:start position:0%
in disrepair because of a natural
 
02:08:11.820 --> 02:08:13.189 align:start position:0%
in disrepair because of a natural
disaster

02:08:13.189 --> 02:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
disaster
 
02:08:15.410 --> 02:08:15.420 align:start position:0%
and they don't have the ability of the
 
02:08:17.990 --> 02:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
funds to help them replace it or repair
 
02:08:20.209 --> 02:08:20.219 align:start position:0%
it they're not going to be able to stay
 
02:08:22.790 --> 02:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
in that property you can't have property
 
02:08:25.070 --> 02:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
without water and they're going to leave
 
02:08:26.510 --> 02:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
and that property value is going to
 
02:08:29.450 --> 02:08:29.460 align:start position:0%
plummet and so will the tax revenue so I
 
02:08:31.189 --> 02:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
think there's so many reasons to support
 
02:08:35.990 --> 02:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:39.050 --> 02:08:39.060 align:start position:0%

02:12:08.750 --> 02:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:11.930 --> 02:12:11.940 align:start position:0%
second by representative Kelly
 
02:12:15.430 --> 02:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
uh we wish to speak on your motion uh
 
02:12:17.930 --> 02:12:17.940 align:start position:0%
representative Vale
 
02:12:21.229 --> 02:12:21.239 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chair thank you um
 
02:12:23.810 --> 02:12:23.820 align:start position:0%
so we had the representatives from
 
02:12:26.209 --> 02:12:26.219 align:start position:0%
Grafton County come and say that the
 
02:12:28.850 --> 02:12:28.860 align:start position:0%
taxpayers are paying 25 percent of their
 
02:12:31.729 --> 02:12:31.739 align:start position:0%
County budget
 
02:12:33.709 --> 02:12:33.719 align:start position:0%
um secondary to difficulties that
 
02:12:36.229 --> 02:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
they're having with the sewer company
 
02:12:40.970 --> 02:12:40.980 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:46.310 --> 02:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:51.050 --> 02:12:51.060 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association des and Grafton
 
02:12:52.970 --> 02:12:52.980 align:start position:0%
was part of
 
02:12:56.689 --> 02:12:56.699 align:start position:0%
a design that this was not a part of
 
02:13:00.169 --> 02:13:00.179 align:start position:0%
so I think the best thing to do would be
 
02:13:02.089 --> 02:13:02.099 align:start position:0%
to retain and to gather some more
 
02:13:05.990 --> 02:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
information about this bill but also to
 
02:13:08.689 --> 02:13:08.699 align:start position:0%
see if the people who brought the bill
 
02:13:11.390 --> 02:13:11.400 align:start position:0%
forward can find some relief by working
 
02:13:11.400 --> 02:13:12.550 align:start position:0%
forward can find some relief by working
through

02:13:12.550 --> 02:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
through
 
02:13:14.930 --> 02:13:14.940 align:start position:0%
the difficulties
 
02:13:17.089 --> 02:13:17.099 align:start position:0%
that they are having in Grafton County
 
02:13:20.569 --> 02:13:20.579 align:start position:0%
and and to be able to um resolve that
 
02:13:23.450 --> 02:13:23.460 align:start position:0%
with a non-legislative solution
 
02:13:25.609 --> 02:13:25.619 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
02:13:28.669 --> 02:13:28.679 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak to the motion
 
02:13:30.589 --> 02:13:30.599 align:start position:0%
representative Rock
 
02:13:32.569 --> 02:13:32.579 align:start position:0%
even though I stated earlier my
 
02:13:34.669 --> 02:13:34.679 align:start position:0%
philosophical opposition to retention
 
02:13:36.410 --> 02:13:36.420 align:start position:0%
because I don't want to spend my Summers
 
02:13:38.990 --> 02:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
here no offense to anybody but the
 
02:13:40.550 --> 02:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
sponsors did indicate that they've been
 
02:13:42.649 --> 02:13:42.659 align:start position:0%
having a continuing dialogue to improve
 
02:13:44.510 --> 02:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
this bill so I do support the retained
 
02:13:44.520 --> 02:13:46.189 align:start position:0%

oh sorry
 
02:17:24.830 --> 02:17:24.840 align:start position:0%
I'd like to make a motion for an

02:17:58.800 --> 02:18:00.110 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:18:00.110 --> 02:18:00.120 align:start position:0%

02:18:31.920 --> 02:18:37.790 align:start position:0%
 
see

02:18:37.790 --> 02:18:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:40.910 --> 02:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
I guess everybody go
 
02:18:40.920 --> 02:18:42.770 align:start position:0%
I guess everybody go
shooting

02:18:42.770 --> 02:18:42.780 align:start position:0%
shooting
 
02:18:46.190 --> 02:18:46.200 align:start position:0%
all right is let's have a look at the
 
02:18:47.330 --> 02:18:47.340 align:start position:0%
amendment why don't you explain the
 
02:18:51.230 --> 02:18:51.240 align:start position:0%
amendment uh sure so first off
 
02:18:51.240 --> 02:18:52.790 align:start position:0%
amendment uh sure so first off
um

02:18:52.790 --> 02:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:55.849 --> 02:18:55.859 align:start position:0%
House Bill 205 and House Bill 398 are
 
02:18:58.429 --> 02:18:58.439 align:start position:0%
very closely related they both
 
02:19:01.070 --> 02:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
um contain similar language for
 
02:19:04.250 --> 02:19:04.260 align:start position:0%
um notification for pfas House Bill 205
 
02:19:06.589 --> 02:19:06.599 align:start position:0%
has a water testing component component
 
02:19:09.110 --> 02:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
and House Bill 398 has a disclosure
 
02:19:09.120 --> 02:19:10.129 align:start position:0%
and House Bill 398 has a disclosure
component

02:19:10.129 --> 02:19:10.139 align:start position:0%
component
 
02:19:12.770 --> 02:19:12.780 align:start position:0%
but there's very similar language with
 
02:19:15.370 --> 02:19:15.380 align:start position:0%
respect to pfas notification
 
02:19:21.049 --> 02:19:21.059 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:21.059 --> 02:19:22.070 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:19:22.070 --> 02:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:24.530 --> 02:19:24.540 align:start position:0%
what I'd really like to propose here
 
02:19:27.410 --> 02:19:27.420 align:start position:0%
is that we have a work session on 205
 
02:19:30.709 --> 02:19:30.719 align:start position:0%
and 398 together because I have another
 
02:19:34.910 --> 02:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
amendment for 398 and I think we might
 
02:19:37.610 --> 02:19:37.620 align:start position:0%
want to discuss how the two are
 
02:19:40.570 --> 02:19:40.580 align:start position:0%
interlinked and what's the appropriate
 
02:19:43.669 --> 02:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh what's the appropriate
 
02:19:45.889 --> 02:19:45.899 align:start position:0%
remedy for both but I'll speak to this
 
02:19:49.910 --> 02:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
amendment Standalone at this point
 
02:19:53.570 --> 02:19:53.580 align:start position:0%
um what I what this amendment does is it
 
02:19:55.370 --> 02:19:55.380 align:start position:0%
um we we heard
 
02:19:59.090 --> 02:19:59.100 align:start position:0%
um pretty clearly that pfas is is having
 
02:19:59.100 --> 02:20:00.710 align:start position:0%
um pretty clearly that pfas is is having
significant

02:20:00.710 --> 02:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
significant
 
02:20:04.070 --> 02:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
um impacts in certain parts of the state
 
02:20:07.190 --> 02:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
but not significant impacts in all parts
 
02:20:08.570 --> 02:20:08.580 align:start position:0%
of the state
 
02:20:13.550 --> 02:20:13.560 align:start position:0%
we also heard that back in 2019 there
 
02:20:17.210 --> 02:20:17.220 align:start position:0%
was unanimous support for a water
 
02:20:21.110 --> 02:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
testing of new wells which according to
 
02:20:23.389 --> 02:20:23.399 align:start position:0%
the criteria of
 
02:20:27.889 --> 02:20:27.899 align:start position:0%
um subpar you know 42 b19-4 this this is
 
02:20:30.650 --> 02:20:30.660 align:start position:0%
basically taken directly from the
 
02:20:32.870 --> 02:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
amendment that passed with unanimous
 
02:20:38.590 --> 02:20:38.600 align:start position:0%
support out of uh our r d in 219
 
02:20:41.090 --> 02:20:41.100 align:start position:0%
passed through the house on consent and
 
02:20:44.809 --> 02:20:44.819 align:start position:0%
then was tabled because of covet in the
 
02:20:44.819 --> 02:20:46.550 align:start position:0%
then was tabled because of covet in the
Senate

02:20:46.550 --> 02:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
Senate
 
02:20:49.610 --> 02:20:49.620 align:start position:0%
um so this basically follows on to that
 
02:20:53.690 --> 02:20:53.700 align:start position:0%
what we heard the pushback about the
 
02:20:55.870 --> 02:20:55.880 align:start position:0%
um the pfas
 
02:20:59.510 --> 02:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
testing in the original 205 bill was
 
02:21:01.969 --> 02:21:01.979 align:start position:0%
that not everyone needed not all
 
02:21:05.270 --> 02:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
locations in the state and not all areas
 
02:21:08.570 --> 02:21:08.580 align:start position:0%
um and not all homeowners would want the
 
02:21:10.070 --> 02:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
pfas testing
 
02:21:13.309 --> 02:21:13.319 align:start position:0%
however there are some areas that it's
 
02:21:16.969 --> 02:21:16.979 align:start position:0%
clear that the pfas testing is required
 
02:21:19.910 --> 02:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
um we also learned that there are tools
 
02:21:19.920 --> 02:21:21.410 align:start position:0%
um we also learned that there are tools
available

02:21:21.410 --> 02:21:21.420 align:start position:0%
available
 
02:21:25.370 --> 02:21:25.380 align:start position:0%
um to uh for example on on the web Now
 
02:21:31.010 --> 02:21:31.020 align:start position:0%
by Des that can tell you where um
 
02:21:33.170 --> 02:21:33.180 align:start position:0%
where the
 
02:21:35.030 --> 02:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
um you know where these pfasts
 
02:21:38.630 --> 02:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
contaminated uh sites have been detected
 
02:21:39.710 --> 02:21:39.720 align:start position:0%
of course that doesn't tell us
 
02:21:41.510 --> 02:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
everywhere in the state where pfas is it
 
02:21:43.010 --> 02:21:43.020 align:start position:0%
just tells us where they've tested for
 
02:21:45.650 --> 02:21:45.660 align:start position:0%
it so what this amendment does is it
 
02:21:49.309 --> 02:21:49.319 align:start position:0%
combines the bill from the 2019-2020
 
02:21:52.070 --> 02:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
session for well testing with another
 
02:21:55.250 --> 02:21:55.260 align:start position:0%
part that says if you are within 500
 
02:21:57.650 --> 02:21:57.660 align:start position:0%
feet of a
 
02:22:01.790 --> 02:22:01.800 align:start position:0%
um of a known pfas contamination site as
 
02:22:05.510 --> 02:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
as that Des knows about oh and there's
 
02:22:10.610 --> 02:22:10.620 align:start position:0%
that's what the the line 24 on page 2
 
02:22:13.370 --> 02:22:13.380 align:start position:0%
talks about is how they would provide
 
02:22:16.130 --> 02:22:16.140 align:start position:0%
and in my I spent a lot of time with
 
02:22:18.469 --> 02:22:18.479 align:start position:0%
this tool my strong opinion
 
02:22:20.870 --> 02:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
um with minimal training someone can use
 
02:22:22.429 --> 02:22:22.439 align:start position:0%
the tool that's already available to
 
02:22:24.650 --> 02:22:24.660 align:start position:0%
meet this exact requirement
 
02:22:27.770 --> 02:22:27.780 align:start position:0%
um then the pfas testing would be
 
02:22:31.250 --> 02:22:31.260 align:start position:0%
required and if the pfas testing so so
 
02:22:33.110 --> 02:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
just to be clear that's in a limited
 
02:22:36.050 --> 02:22:36.060 align:start position:0%
part of the state where we where there's
 
02:22:38.750 --> 02:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
demonstrated pfas contamination
 
02:22:42.410 --> 02:22:42.420 align:start position:0%
if the pfas testing is performed then
 
02:22:46.010 --> 02:22:46.020 align:start position:0%
that result the pfas report would also
 
02:22:48.170 --> 02:22:48.180 align:start position:0%
um be sent to Des so then they could
 
02:22:50.469 --> 02:22:50.479 align:start position:0%
further update their database
 
02:22:54.070 --> 02:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
this because in my opinion
 
02:22:57.349 --> 02:22:57.359 align:start position:0%
the the notification and
 
02:22:59.929 --> 02:22:59.939 align:start position:0%
um disclosure portion of the real estate
 
02:23:02.389 --> 02:23:02.399 align:start position:0%
transactions are different from well
 
02:23:05.150 --> 02:23:05.160 align:start position:0%
testing for new wells that's why I
 
02:23:07.130 --> 02:23:07.140 align:start position:0%
pulled those pieces out and have an

um
 
02:28:28.910 --> 02:28:28.920 align:start position:0%
yes I my understanding after the hearing
 
02:28:31.730 --> 02:28:31.740 align:start position:0%
is that um this
 
02:28:34.429 --> 02:28:34.439 align:start position:0%
simply updates the language so that
 
02:28:37.550 --> 02:28:37.560 align:start position:0%
municipalities as well as Des may have
 
02:28:40.070 --> 02:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
more flexibility and how they address
 
02:28:43.370 --> 02:28:43.380 align:start position:0%
water quality issues
 
02:28:46.910 --> 02:28:46.920 align:start position:0%
right now uh Mr
 
02:28:49.510 --> 02:28:49.520 align:start position:0%

uh I I support
 
02:28:55.370 --> 02:28:55.380 align:start position:0%
um on to pass on this I think we had
 
02:28:57.710 --> 02:28:57.720 align:start position:0%
this discussion resources had at the end
 
02:29:00.590 --> 02:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
of last term and uh this is something
 
02:29:02.590 --> 02:29:02.600 align:start position:0%
that has broad supported updates
 
02:29:05.870 --> 02:29:05.880 align:start position:0%
obsolete language so I it's deserving a
 
02:29:09.469 --> 02:29:09.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:09.479 --> 02:29:11.630 align:start position:0%

so we got 11 to 9 here on this one yeah
so

02:30:55.610 --> 02:30:55.620 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:30:57.830 --> 02:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
so we're gonna have a minority
 
02:31:01.070 --> 02:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
that was the ATM this is this is oh this
 
02:31:01.080 --> 02:31:08.570 align:start position:0%
that was the ATM this is this is oh this
is

02:31:08.570 --> 02:31:08.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:24.969 --> 03:12:24.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:29.269 --> 03:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I move that we itl
 
03:12:29.279 --> 03:12:31.910 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I move that we itl
592.

03:12:31.910 --> 03:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
592.
 
03:12:35.450 --> 03:12:35.460 align:start position:0%
there's a motion to itl 592 which is
 
03:12:38.690 --> 03:12:38.700 align:start position:0%
relative to buffers around Wetlands is
 
03:12:43.450 --> 03:12:43.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:47.510 --> 03:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
Ed by representative Ryan
 
03:12:51.230 --> 03:12:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:54.170 --> 03:12:54.180 align:start position:0%
recorded by representative Ryan would
 
03:12:54.180 --> 03:12:54.950 align:start position:0%
recorded by representative Ryan would
you

03:12:54.950 --> 03:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:12:54.960 --> 03:12:57.230 align:start position:0%
you
speak

03:12:57.230 --> 03:12:57.240 align:start position:0%
speak
 
03:13:02.330 --> 03:13:02.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:04.570 --> 03:13:04.580 align:start position:0%
it's on
 
03:13:07.309 --> 03:13:07.319 align:start position:0%
I said you can go longer as you said
 
03:13:10.130 --> 03:13:10.140 align:start position:0%
short in Sweden well okay don't stop for
 
03:13:10.140 --> 03:13:13.389 align:start position:0%
short in Sweden well okay don't stop for
me

03:13:13.389 --> 03:13:13.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:15.769 --> 03:13:15.779 align:start position:0%
all of the correspondents that I've
 
03:13:18.410 --> 03:13:18.420 align:start position:0%
gotten says that this is an issue that
 
03:13:21.309 --> 03:13:21.319 align:start position:0%
should be handled locally local control
 
03:13:24.349 --> 03:13:24.359 align:start position:0%
and I'm not one to step on local control
 
03:13:30.429 --> 03:13:30.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:36.050 --> 03:13:36.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:38.090 --> 03:13:38.100 align:start position:0%
um thank you yes
 
03:13:40.370 --> 03:13:40.380 align:start position:0%
um this this bill interferes with
 
03:13:42.910 --> 03:13:42.920 align:start position:0%
conservation commissions and their
 
03:13:46.610 --> 03:13:46.620 align:start position:0%
abilities to monitor buffer zones buffer
 
03:13:48.590 --> 03:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
zones in New Hampshire very anywhere
 
03:13:53.450 --> 03:13:53.460 align:start position:0%
from 25 feet to 3 um 160 feet if I'm
 
03:13:56.110 --> 03:13:56.120 align:start position:0%
going to build a 3 000 square foot
 
03:13:59.750 --> 03:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
impediment into a 25 foot buffer it's
 
03:14:03.230 --> 03:14:03.240 align:start position:0%
quite a bit big difference than building
 
03:14:06.050 --> 03:14:06.060 align:start position:0%
it into a town that has a 160 foot
 
03:14:08.690 --> 03:14:08.700 align:start position:0%
buffer let's let the towns do
 
03:14:11.990 --> 03:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
um their own job thank you
 
03:14:14.650 --> 03:14:14.660 align:start position:0%
anyone else uh speak to this
 
03:14:16.910 --> 03:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
representative McHugh
 
03:14:19.130 --> 03:14:19.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I think anytime we
 
03:14:20.809 --> 03:14:20.819 align:start position:0%
hear from the municipal Society
 
03:14:23.269 --> 03:14:23.279 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association and the Audubon
 
03:14:26.630 --> 03:14:26.640 align:start position:0%
Society both sing in an expedient
 
03:14:30.230 --> 03:14:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:34.010 --> 03:14:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:36.050 --> 03:14:36.060 align:start position:0%
that tells you something
 
03:14:37.610 --> 03:14:37.620 align:start position:0%
so I'll support the motion of
 
03:14:39.590 --> 03:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate
 
03:14:41.570 --> 03:14:41.580 align:start position:0%
in favor of local control and supporting
 
03:14:43.969 --> 03:14:43.979 align:start position:0%
the Audubon Society at the same time
 
03:14:45.769 --> 03:14:45.779 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:14:50.090 --> 03:14:50.100 align:start position:0%
anyone else have anything to say
 
03:14:55.309 --> 03:14:55.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:58.969 --> 03:14:58.979 align:start position:0%
I've been been dealing with Wetlands now
 
03:15:02.210 --> 03:15:02.220 align:start position:0%
and and buffer zones or
 
03:15:04.070 --> 03:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
all but
 
03:15:06.110 --> 03:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
eight well for eight out of my nine
 
03:15:07.550 --> 03:15:07.560 align:start position:0%
terms here
 
03:15:10.610 --> 03:15:10.620 align:start position:0%
and it was always interesting that
 
03:15:10.620 --> 03:15:11.769 align:start position:0%
and it was always interesting that
that

03:15:11.769 --> 03:15:11.779 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:15:15.410 --> 03:15:15.420 align:start position:0%
the you had wetlands
 
03:15:15.420 --> 03:15:17.510 align:start position:0%
the you had wetlands
uh

03:15:17.510 --> 03:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:15:21.410 --> 03:15:21.420 align:start position:0%
where was the what was where you know it
 
03:15:24.170 --> 03:15:24.180 align:start position:0%
was the value the quote valuable land
 
03:15:26.330 --> 03:15:26.340 align:start position:0%
because that was wetlands
 
03:15:29.090 --> 03:15:29.100 align:start position:0%
but for always wanted to get
 
03:15:29.100 --> 03:15:30.290 align:start position:0%
but for always wanted to get
at

03:15:30.290 --> 03:15:30.300 align:start position:0%
at
 
03:15:30.300 --> 03:15:31.730 align:start position:0%
at
the

03:15:31.730 --> 03:15:31.740 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:15:34.309 --> 03:15:34.319 align:start position:0%
folks wanted to get at the Uplands
 
03:15:38.330 --> 03:15:38.340 align:start position:0%
which is actually the usable land
 
03:15:41.510 --> 03:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:41.520 --> 03:15:43.730 align:start position:0%
 
and

03:15:43.730 --> 03:15:43.740 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:15:47.349 --> 03:15:47.359 align:start position:0%
but the only place where
 
03:15:50.450 --> 03:15:50.460 align:start position:0%
the the only place in the uh
 
03:15:53.809 --> 03:15:53.819 align:start position:0%
environmental statutes that we deal with
 
03:15:57.290 --> 03:15:57.300 align:start position:0%
where where they're where they discuss
 
03:16:01.130 --> 03:16:01.140 align:start position:0%
the buffer zones which is a Uplands is
 
03:16:03.469 --> 03:16:03.479 align:start position:0%
then where whereas with uh
 
03:16:05.630 --> 03:16:05.640 align:start position:0%
Prime wetlands
 
03:16:07.910 --> 03:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
and not
 
03:16:12.050 --> 03:16:12.060 align:start position:0%
anywhere else it happens this
 
03:16:15.230 --> 03:16:15.240 align:start position:0%
well uh uh the the
 
03:16:16.910 --> 03:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
buffer zones
 
03:16:20.530 --> 03:16:20.540 align:start position:0%
which are but which is the good land
 
03:16:25.070 --> 03:16:25.080 align:start position:0%
is handled in the zoning ordinances
 
03:16:27.410 --> 03:16:27.420 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:16:31.269 --> 03:16:31.279 align:start position:0%
this bill unfortunately deals with
 
03:16:34.910 --> 03:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
ordinances that we control which are the
 
03:16:37.849 --> 03:16:37.859 align:start position:0%
uh you know the the wetlands the the
 
03:16:41.750 --> 03:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
wetlands ordinances but the Uplands
 
03:16:43.429 --> 03:16:43.439 align:start position:0%
the buffer zones
 
03:16:46.550 --> 03:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
that's in a totally
 
03:16:46.560 --> 03:16:48.170 align:start position:0%
that's in a totally
separate

03:16:48.170 --> 03:16:48.180 align:start position:0%
separate
 
03:16:48.180 --> 03:16:49.870 align:start position:0%
separate
uh

03:16:49.870 --> 03:16:49.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:16:53.269 --> 03:16:53.279 align:start position:0%
totally totally separate uh statue
 
03:16:55.550 --> 03:16:55.560 align:start position:0%
that's under the control of Municipal
 
03:16:56.809 --> 03:16:56.819 align:start position:0%
and County
 
03:16:56.819 --> 03:16:58.969 align:start position:0%
and County
so

03:16:58.969 --> 03:16:58.979 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:17:01.429 --> 03:17:01.439 align:start position:0%
we have no choice
 
03:17:03.469 --> 03:17:03.479 align:start position:0%
but to
 
03:17:06.410 --> 03:17:06.420 align:start position:0%
find this bill ideal simply because it's
 
03:17:08.269 --> 03:17:08.279 align:start position:0%
in the wrong place
 
03:17:10.969 --> 03:17:10.979 align:start position:0%
so uh it's not that I'm against against
 
03:17:14.210 --> 03:17:14.220 align:start position:0%
the bill if I were in Municipal and
 
03:17:14.220 --> 03:17:16.250 align:start position:0%
the bill if I were in Municipal and
County

03:17:16.250 --> 03:17:16.260 align:start position:0%
County
 
03:17:19.730 --> 03:17:19.740 align:start position:0%
but I'm not
 
03:17:19.740 --> 03:17:21.050 align:start position:0%
but I'm not
uh

03:17:21.050 --> 03:17:21.060 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:17:25.190 --> 03:17:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:28.190 --> 03:17:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:33.830 --> 03:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:39.050 --> 03:17:39.060 align:start position:0%

and
that

03:19:53.389 --> 03:19:53.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:57.530 --> 03:19:57.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I move itl

and a motion to itl on House Bill 488
 
03:20:06.469 --> 03:20:06.479 align:start position:0%
okay motion itl on 488 is uh they're a
 
03:20:06.479 --> 03:20:08.330 align:start position:0%
okay motion itl on 488 is uh they're a
second

03:20:08.330 --> 03:20:08.340 align:start position:0%
second
 
03:20:11.030 --> 03:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
the second representative Darby
 
03:20:18.610 --> 03:20:18.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:21.349 --> 03:20:21.359 align:start position:0%
was to speak on your uh
 
03:20:25.330 --> 03:20:25.340 align:start position:0%
on your motion Representatives Bale
 
03:20:28.670 --> 03:20:28.680 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chair thank you
 
03:20:32.990 --> 03:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
um House Bill 48 uh 488 which is
 
03:20:35.170 --> 03:20:35.180 align:start position:0%
relative to State Park campground
 
03:20:37.849 --> 03:20:37.859 align:start position:0%
reservations this would this would
 
03:20:41.110 --> 03:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
enable the division of parks and recs to
 
03:20:43.429 --> 03:20:43.439 align:start position:0%
allow New Hampshire residents a time
 
03:20:46.309 --> 03:20:46.319 align:start position:0%
period to receive a state park campsite
 
03:20:48.830 --> 03:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
prior to out-of-state residence but we
 
03:20:51.950 --> 03:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
did hear that um
 
03:20:54.170 --> 03:20:54.180 align:start position:0%
that as it is written this isn't
 
03:20:56.870 --> 03:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
something that we can do because it it
 
03:20:59.510 --> 03:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
um also
 
03:20:59.520 --> 03:21:03.230 align:start position:0%
um also
involves

03:21:03.230 --> 03:21:03.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:07.370 --> 03:21:07.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:11.210 --> 03:21:11.220 align:start position:0%
it involves federal government because
 
03:21:12.650 --> 03:21:12.660 align:start position:0%
of the fact that
 
03:21:16.429 --> 03:21:16.439 align:start position:0%
any park that has even one feature that
 
03:21:19.370 --> 03:21:19.380 align:start position:0%
was funded by federal dollars would
 
03:21:22.070 --> 03:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
perhaps not fall under this
 
03:21:25.550 --> 03:21:25.560 align:start position:0%
law so for those reasons
 
03:21:28.790 --> 03:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
I'm I motion to IPL
 
03:21:28.800 --> 03:21:34.490 align:start position:0%
I'm I motion to IPL
right

03:21:34.490 --> 03:21:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:38.389 --> 03:21:38.399 align:start position:0%
representative Darby thank you Mr
 
03:21:40.010 --> 03:21:40.020 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
03:21:43.670 --> 03:21:43.680 align:start position:0%
so um just uh piggybacking on what
 
03:21:46.250 --> 03:21:46.260 align:start position:0%
representative Bale said um you know it
 
03:21:48.050 --> 03:21:48.060 align:start position:0%
it's in conflict with the land and water
 
03:21:49.670 --> 03:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
conservation act
 
03:21:52.849 --> 03:21:52.859 align:start position:0%
um they also testified that it was going
 
03:21:56.030 --> 03:21:56.040 align:start position:0%
to be difficult to implement with their
 
03:21:58.429 --> 03:21:58.439 align:start position:0%
current vendor ticket vendor and would
 
03:21:58.439 --> 03:21:59.410 align:start position:0%
current vendor ticket vendor and would
require

03:21:59.410 --> 03:21:59.420 align:start position:0%
require
 
03:22:01.910 --> 03:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
potentially significant cost associated
 
03:22:04.130 --> 03:22:04.140 align:start position:0%
with that and they've had they had a
 
03:22:06.410 --> 03:22:06.420 align:start position:0%
prior issue in fact with violations of
 
03:22:08.990 --> 03:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
the landing conservation act with a
 
03:22:12.769 --> 03:22:12.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:16.190 --> 03:22:16.200 align:start position:0%
and in no um because of those reasons I
 
03:22:19.130 --> 03:22:19.140 align:start position:0%
I don't see a way to save this Bill
 
03:22:22.370 --> 03:22:22.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:24.170 --> 03:22:24.180 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
03:22:27.110 --> 03:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
I did get a phone call from uh the
 
03:22:27.120 --> 03:22:28.309 align:start position:0%
I did get a phone call from uh the

all right let's go back up to uh 247.
 
03:24:34.929 --> 03:24:34.939 align:start position:0%
that was that was built 247 and then
 
03:24:43.969 --> 03:24:43.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:45.530 --> 03:24:45.540 align:start position:0%

47.
 
03:24:57.469 --> 03:24:57.479 align:start position:0%
um I would like to make a motion to itl
 
03:24:59.929 --> 03:24:59.939 align:start position:0%
I mean uh no no no no no no no no no no
 
03:25:03.650 --> 03:25:03.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:07.130 --> 03:25:07.140 align:start position:0%
OTP I'm sorry we got the wrong one
 
03:25:10.250 --> 03:25:10.260 align:start position:0%
um thank you
 
03:25:12.830 --> 03:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
I'll second that
 
03:25:15.650 --> 03:25:15.660 align:start position:0%
we've made in a sec seconded
 
03:25:18.769 --> 03:25:18.779 align:start position:0%
okay and just speak to it um I'll just
 
03:25:21.830 --> 03:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
say that house bill 247
 
03:25:24.950 --> 03:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh fiscal note relative to protective
 
03:25:27.050 --> 03:25:27.060 align:start position:0%
well radii clears up confusing language
 
03:25:29.929 --> 03:25:29.939 align:start position:0%
about the property rights on any portion
 
03:25:32.090 --> 03:25:32.100 align:start position:0%
of the protective well radius which is
 
03:25:35.630 --> 03:25:35.640 align:start position:0%
not maintained on lot or on a recorded
 
03:25:38.690 --> 03:25:38.700 align:start position:0%
easement and has some other housekeeping
 
03:25:38.700 --> 03:25:40.070 align:start position:0%
easement and has some other housekeeping
features

03:25:40.070 --> 03:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
features
 
03:25:42.830 --> 03:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
um and it was uh
 
03:25:44.990 --> 03:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
comes highly recommended
 
03:25:48.410 --> 03:25:48.420 align:start position:0%
as clarifying this portion of the
 
03:25:52.790 --> 03:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:56.570 --> 03:25:56.580 align:start position:0%
Peach is there anybody uh I'd like to
 
03:26:00.229 --> 03:26:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:03.650 --> 03:26:03.660 align:start position:0%
just to comment that after our visit
 
03:26:07.130 --> 03:26:07.140 align:start position:0%
with the Des and their explanation of
 
03:26:09.410 --> 03:26:09.420 align:start position:0%
what they do and they are graphs about
 
03:26:12.349 --> 03:26:12.359 align:start position:0%
well radii I certainly support uh
 
03:26:12.359 --> 03:26:15.309 align:start position:0%
well radii I certainly support uh
octopass

03:26:15.309 --> 03:26:15.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:17.870 --> 03:26:17.880 align:start position:0%
is there any questions representative
 
03:26:20.690 --> 03:26:20.700 align:start position:0%
Darby not so much a question just just a
 
03:26:22.729 --> 03:26:22.739 align:start position:0%
comment I
 
03:26:27.229 --> 03:26:27.239 align:start position:0%
um I very much support the the um well
 
03:26:29.450 --> 03:26:29.460 align:start position:0%
really everything in this bill
 
03:26:32.090 --> 03:26:32.100 align:start position:0%
um especially the optimizations that it
 
03:26:35.210 --> 03:26:35.220 align:start position:0%
will provide for the the well drillers
 
03:26:37.729 --> 03:26:37.739 align:start position:0%
um the you know the lack of reducing
 
03:26:39.769 --> 03:26:39.779 align:start position:0%
redundant paperwork that should reduce
 
03:26:42.250 --> 03:26:42.260 align:start position:0%
costs and as it's been explained by Des
 
03:26:46.130 --> 03:26:46.140 align:start position:0%
without any risk of
 
03:26:50.330 --> 03:26:50.340 align:start position:0%
um of any loss of protection on um to
 
03:26:51.710 --> 03:26:51.720 align:start position:0%
the the homeowner through the well
 
03:26:54.530 --> 03:26:54.540 align:start position:0%
there's they have very good DS's very
 
03:26:56.450 --> 03:26:56.460 align:start position:0%
good relationships with you know the
 
03:26:59.690 --> 03:26:59.700 align:start position:0%
well drillers and the septic companies I
 
03:27:02.290 --> 03:27:02.300 align:start position:0%
did have a question originally about
 
03:27:06.469 --> 03:27:06.479 align:start position:0%
removing the reporting of the deed the
 
03:27:08.269 --> 03:27:08.279 align:start position:0%
language that removes the reporting of
 
03:27:10.610 --> 03:27:10.620 align:start position:0%
the deed because there I was concerned
 
03:27:10.620 --> 03:27:11.870 align:start position:0%
the deed because there I was concerned
that

03:27:11.870 --> 03:27:11.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:27:15.710 --> 03:27:15.720 align:start position:0%
um even though there is a website where
 
03:27:19.910 --> 03:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
a potential buyer could go to
 
03:27:22.130 --> 03:27:22.140 align:start position:0%
um to check the you know for example the
 
03:27:24.110 --> 03:27:24.120 align:start position:0%
well radii that that wouldn't that might
 
03:27:27.530 --> 03:27:27.540 align:start position:0%
not be obvious for a homeowner where
 
03:27:29.630 --> 03:27:29.640 align:start position:0%
everyone looks at I think looks at their
 
03:27:31.790 --> 03:27:31.800 align:start position:0%
deed before buying a piece of property
 
03:27:34.610 --> 03:27:34.620 align:start position:0%
however after some discussions with Des
 
03:27:39.229 --> 03:27:39.239 align:start position:0%
I realized I was informed that the
 
03:27:41.630 --> 03:27:41.640 align:start position:0%
um if the well radii the protected well
 
03:27:45.889 --> 03:27:45.899 align:start position:0%
radii goes on overlaps at a Butter's
 
03:27:48.309 --> 03:27:48.319 align:start position:0%
property even if there's nothing
 
03:27:51.190 --> 03:27:51.200 align:start position:0%
potentially dangerous there
 
03:27:54.050 --> 03:27:54.060 align:start position:0%
they still have to use the protective
 
03:27:56.630 --> 03:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
methods that we heard about from uh from
 
03:27:57.889 --> 03:27:57.899 align:start position:0%
the well drillers
 
03:28:01.070 --> 03:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
um and so I just I just wanted to state
 
03:28:03.469 --> 03:28:03.479 align:start position:0%
that um any concerns that I may have had
 
03:28:03.479 --> 03:28:04.729 align:start position:0%
that um any concerns that I may have had
about

03:28:04.729 --> 03:28:04.739 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:28:07.370 --> 03:28:07.380 align:start position:0%
um that recording of the deed have been
 
03:28:09.290 --> 03:28:09.300 align:start position:0%
removed and I definitely support octopus
 
03:28:11.090 --> 03:28:11.100 align:start position:0%

03:28:15.889 --> 03:28:15.899 align:start position:0%

03:28:27.469 --> 03:28:27.479 align:start position:0%
that's bill 247. no way all of a sudden
 
03:28:29.570 --> 03:28:29.580 align:start position:0%
this light came in over my shoulder I
 
03:28:29.580 --> 03:28:30.530 align:start position:0%

Healy
 
03:30:20.150 --> 03:30:20.160 align:start position:0%
or emotion on this one I'd like to put
 
03:30:22.610 --> 03:30:22.620 align:start position:0%
in an expedient legislative in
 
03:30:24.650 --> 03:30:24.660 align:start position:0%
experience the legislate do I have a
 
03:30:24.660 --> 03:30:25.969 align:start position:0%
experience the legislate do I have a
second

03:30:25.969 --> 03:30:25.979 align:start position:0%
second
 
03:30:29.809 --> 03:30:29.819 align:start position:0%
second by representative harp
 
03:30:32.870 --> 03:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
you wish to speak to your motion
 
03:30:35.929 --> 03:30:35.939 align:start position:0%
while we heard on this one was the the
 
03:30:38.510 --> 03:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
cost and the time frame to do this would
 
03:30:41.630 --> 03:30:41.640 align:start position:0%
be extremely primitive to have the
 
03:30:43.790 --> 03:30:43.800 align:start position:0%
something like this done
 
03:30:45.710 --> 03:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
um costs were anywhere from fifteen
 
03:30:47.210 --> 03:30:47.220 align:start position:0%
thousand up to a hundred thousand
 
03:30:49.849 --> 03:30:49.859 align:start position:0%
dollars and then to drill all the wells
 
03:30:51.710 --> 03:30:51.720 align:start position:0%
into all the testings they said it could
 
03:30:53.809 --> 03:30:53.819 align:start position:0%
be anywhere from six to nine months just
 
03:30:55.190 --> 03:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
not uh
 
03:30:56.690 --> 03:30:56.700 align:start position:0%
acceptable when you're trying to do
 
03:31:00.650 --> 03:31:00.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:02.990 --> 03:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
representative herb you have to speak to
 
03:31:05.510 --> 03:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
your second I'm just adding one thing to
 
03:31:07.910 --> 03:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
representative Healey's comments uh my
 
03:31:10.070 --> 03:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
memory is that they also talked about it
 
03:31:11.990 --> 03:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
being a moving Target that you could do
 
03:31:13.969 --> 03:31:13.979 align:start position:0%
this analysis one day and it would
 
03:31:16.729 --> 03:31:16.739 align:start position:0%
change the next day because of changes
 
03:31:20.030 --> 03:31:20.040 align:start position:0%
in the area so for that reason I support
 
03:31:20.040 --> 03:31:23.990 align:start position:0%
in the area so for that reason I support
Ito

03:31:23.990 --> 03:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:24.000 --> 03:31:25.370 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:31:25.370 --> 03:31:25.380 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:31:27.650 --> 03:31:27.660 align:start position:0%
so anyone wish to speak to the to the
 
03:31:29.809 --> 03:31:29.819 align:start position:0%
bill representative Rob
 
03:31:32.330 --> 03:31:32.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
03:31:34.309 --> 03:31:34.319 align:start position:0%
um after saying that I'm against
 
03:31:36.650 --> 03:31:36.660 align:start position:0%
retained bills I do recommend it for
 
03:31:39.050 --> 03:31:39.060 align:start position:0%
this one just because I'd be willing to
 
03:31:42.229 --> 03:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
to work on it but if you remember back
 
03:31:46.190 --> 03:31:46.200 align:start position:0%
in 2018 or 2019 there was a bill that
 
03:31:47.750 --> 03:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
came before this committee by
 
03:31:50.150 --> 03:31:50.160 align:start position:0%
representative Mark Pearson and I
 
03:31:52.550 --> 03:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
believe a representative Deb Hobson who
 
03:31:54.610 --> 03:31:54.620 align:start position:0%
was on the committee was a co-sponsor
 
03:31:58.370 --> 03:31:58.380 align:start position:0%
and it was in regard to the fact that
 
03:32:01.309 --> 03:32:01.319 align:start position:0%
there was a community water system near
 
03:32:04.010 --> 03:32:04.020 align:start position:0%
a near some houses and they were they
 
03:32:06.290 --> 03:32:06.300 align:start position:0%
replaced their well and in the course of
 
03:32:08.690 --> 03:32:08.700 align:start position:0%
doing that they ruined all the wells of
 
03:32:12.170 --> 03:32:12.180 align:start position:0%
the neighbors and that bill passed
 
03:32:14.269 --> 03:32:14.279 align:start position:0%
unanimously in this committee passed the
 
03:32:17.870 --> 03:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
house on consent passed the Senate but
 
03:32:20.510 --> 03:32:20.520 align:start position:0%
it died the coveted Death in June of
 
03:32:24.349 --> 03:32:24.359 align:start position:0%
2000 and I really see that some of the
 
03:32:27.170 --> 03:32:27.180 align:start position:0%
concerns that were in that bill overlap
 
03:32:30.290 --> 03:32:30.300 align:start position:0%
with some of these not for the extensive
 
03:32:33.530 --> 03:32:33.540 align:start position:0%
hydrology testing but the fact that
 
03:32:36.110 --> 03:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
there needs to be some responsibility of
 
03:32:38.630 --> 03:32:38.640 align:start position:0%
for people putting in new or replacement
 
03:32:41.450 --> 03:32:41.460 align:start position:0%
Wells to ensure that those Wells do not
 
03:32:43.309 --> 03:32:43.319 align:start position:0%
negatively impact or cause other Wells
 
03:32:44.630 --> 03:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
to go dry
 
03:32:46.849 --> 03:32:46.859 align:start position:0%
so I think this bill could really work
 
03:32:50.150 --> 03:32:50.160 align:start position:0%
well particularly in context with that
 
03:32:54.050 --> 03:32:54.060 align:start position:0%
previous bill I did speak to the prime
 
03:32:55.969 --> 03:32:55.979 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this bill and she's willing
 
03:32:59.690 --> 03:32:59.700 align:start position:0%
to work on that bill more to find some
 
03:33:02.570 --> 03:33:02.580 align:start position:0%
common ground and the intent of
 
03:33:04.370 --> 03:33:04.380 align:start position:0%
protecting other people's Wells which is
 
03:33:05.990 --> 03:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
really what this is about it's really
 
03:33:08.690 --> 03:33:08.700 align:start position:0%
protecting other people's Wells from
 
03:33:10.849 --> 03:33:10.859 align:start position:0%
damage caused by new wells
 
03:33:13.309 --> 03:33:13.319 align:start position:0%
and and find some commonplace I'm I'm
 
03:33:14.870 --> 03:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
sorry I don't have it in front of me the
 
03:33:17.269 --> 03:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
the bill from 2020. but do you remember
 
03:33:21.650 --> 03:33:21.660 align:start position:0%
that bill oh yes I did yeah remember um
 
03:33:23.090 --> 03:33:23.100 align:start position:0%
what the
 
03:33:25.929 --> 03:33:25.939 align:start position:0%
the that was one of the bills that we uh
 
03:33:28.790 --> 03:33:28.800 align:start position:0%
attached a
 
03:33:31.370 --> 03:33:31.380 align:start position:0%
uh attached
 
03:33:31.380 --> 03:33:32.750 align:start position:0%
uh attached
having

03:33:32.750 --> 03:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
having
 
03:33:38.590 --> 03:33:38.600 align:start position:0%
uh co uh having uh uh pfas money
 
03:33:44.090 --> 03:33:44.100 align:start position:0%
be put be given to uh homeowners that
 
03:33:46.309 --> 03:33:46.319 align:start position:0%
was one of the uh we had there was
 
03:33:46.319 --> 03:33:47.750 align:start position:0%
was one of the uh we had there was
several

03:33:47.750 --> 03:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
several
 
03:33:52.070 --> 03:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
uh iterations of uh packing
 
03:33:54.650 --> 03:33:54.660 align:start position:0%
things onto various bills and that was
 
03:33:56.570 --> 03:33:56.580 align:start position:0%
one of the bills that that type of thing
 
03:33:59.090 --> 03:33:59.100 align:start position:0%
got tacked onto so
 
03:33:59.100 --> 03:34:00.610 align:start position:0%
got tacked onto so
okay

03:34:00.610 --> 03:34:00.620 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:34:04.550 --> 03:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
so um I'm gonna support again I know the
 
03:34:05.870 --> 03:34:05.880 align:start position:0%
bill yeah
 
03:34:07.610 --> 03:34:07.620 align:start position:0%
yeah because I when I went up and looked
 
03:34:09.769 --> 03:34:09.779 align:start position:0%
at the bill history had been laid on the
 
03:34:12.290 --> 03:34:12.300 align:start position:0%
table on I think it was June 6 whatever
 
03:34:14.030 --> 03:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
that but I remember that day because
 
03:34:15.530 --> 03:34:15.540 align:start position:0%
that's the day where a lot of bills
 
03:34:16.550 --> 03:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
couldn't get through because they
 
03:34:20.229 --> 03:34:20.239 align:start position:0%
required two-thirds to suspend the rules
 
03:34:23.630 --> 03:34:23.640 align:start position:0%
if you look at that yeah so I'm going to
 
03:34:26.030 --> 03:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
vote against the itl but willing to
 
03:34:29.150 --> 03:34:29.160 align:start position:0%
support a motion to retain if the itl
 
03:34:31.610 --> 03:34:31.620 align:start position:0%
does not pass
 
03:34:31.620 --> 03:34:32.870 align:start position:0%
does not pass
yeah

03:34:32.870 --> 03:34:32.880 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:34:44.929 --> 03:34:44.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:44.939 --> 03:34:47.269 align:start position:0%
 
not

03:39:20.510 --> 03:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:23.750 --> 03:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:07.790 --> 03:40:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:07.800 --> 03:40:53.150 align:start position:0%

okay

03:40:56.690 --> 03:40:56.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:58.729 --> 03:40:58.739 align:start position:0%
let's see how to see if the light it's
 
03:41:01.670 --> 03:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
the seat at the light is on
 
03:41:04.370 --> 03:41:04.380 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
03:41:04.380 --> 03:41:05.650 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
okay

03:41:05.650 --> 03:41:05.660 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:41:08.330 --> 03:41:08.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so having a look
 
03:41:10.010 --> 03:41:10.020 align:start position:0%
at this amendment
 
03:41:10.020 --> 03:41:10.849 align:start position:0%
at this amendment
um

03:41:10.849 --> 03:41:10.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:12.229 --> 03:41:12.239 align:start position:0%
representative wrong you're offering the
 
03:41:12.239 --> 03:41:14.450 align:start position:0%
representative wrong you're offering the
amendment

03:41:14.450 --> 03:41:14.460 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:41:16.550 --> 03:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
um actually the amendment was drafted by
 
03:41:18.650 --> 03:41:18.660 align:start position:0%
representative Crawford
 
03:41:20.050 --> 03:41:20.060 align:start position:0%
um but um
 
03:41:22.610 --> 03:41:22.620 align:start position:0%
she asked you know I told her I could
 
03:41:25.670 --> 03:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:29.450 --> 03:41:29.460 align:start position:0%
so I'll just speak to my motion um first
 
03:41:31.670 --> 03:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
so my motion is in expedient to
 
03:41:34.370 --> 03:41:34.380 align:start position:0%
legislate because the bill is drafted
 
03:41:34.380 --> 03:41:35.330 align:start position:0%
legislate because the bill is drafted
um

03:41:35.330 --> 03:41:35.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:37.490 --> 03:41:37.500 align:start position:0%
would made it would make it impossible
 
03:41:39.650 --> 03:41:39.660 align:start position:0%
for a landowner to even place a
 
03:41:41.389 --> 03:41:41.399 align:start position:0%
temporary seasonal dock
 
03:41:44.030 --> 03:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
on any of their land deemed impacted by
 
03:41:46.370 --> 03:41:46.380 align:start position:0%
an endangered species under the
 
03:41:48.530 --> 03:41:48.540 align:start position:0%
conservation act and as I see it now
 
03:41:51.050 --> 03:41:51.060 align:start position:0%
fish and game has plenty of ways to
 
03:41:51.060 --> 03:41:52.070 align:start position:0%
fish and game has plenty of ways to
enforce

03:41:52.070 --> 03:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
enforce
 
03:41:56.150 --> 03:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
uh and penalties under 212a misdemeanors
 
03:41:59.210 --> 03:41:59.220 align:start position:0%
violations and right now to get a
 
03:42:00.530 --> 03:42:00.540 align:start position:0%
temporary seasonal dock you have to
 
03:42:02.929 --> 03:42:02.939 align:start position:0%
notify the department and satisfy the 10
 
03:42:06.229 --> 03:42:06.239 align:start position:0%
requirements that you see in the bill
 
03:42:11.990 --> 03:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
and this bill adds a Prohibition
 
03:42:14.510 --> 03:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
for that landowner so that you can never
 
03:42:18.290 --> 03:42:18.300 align:start position:0%
get a seasonal dock if there's any
 
03:42:18.300 --> 03:42:19.729 align:start position:0%
get a seasonal dock if there's any
impact

03:42:19.729 --> 03:42:19.739 align:start position:0%
impact
 
03:42:22.070 --> 03:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
to any Wildlife species or threatened
 
03:42:22.080 --> 03:42:23.330 align:start position:0%
to any Wildlife species or threatened
species

03:42:23.330 --> 03:42:23.340 align:start position:0%
species
 
03:42:26.210 --> 03:42:26.220 align:start position:0%
and and frankly doesn't really do
 
03:42:27.950 --> 03:42:27.960 align:start position:0%
anything kind of like a speed limit side
 
03:42:30.349 --> 03:42:30.359 align:start position:0%
does it doesn't prevent a speeder like
 
03:42:32.510 --> 03:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
the person could still do it it doesn't
 
03:42:34.450 --> 03:42:34.460 align:start position:0%
really protect
 
03:42:36.950 --> 03:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
that wildlife
 
03:42:39.889 --> 03:42:39.899 align:start position:0%
or that threatened species so I suppose
 
03:42:42.050 --> 03:42:42.060 align:start position:0%
that's why the head of the doc
 
03:42:43.790 --> 03:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner supposes the bill he says
 
03:42:46.130 --> 03:42:46.140 align:start position:0%
it doesn't to remind the process and he
 
03:42:47.330 --> 03:42:47.340 align:start position:0%
doesn't think it's a terribly well
 
03:42:49.190 --> 03:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
written bill so I think as it is it's
 
03:42:52.670 --> 03:42:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:52.680 --> 03:42:54.050 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:42:54.050 --> 03:42:54.060 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:42:56.809 --> 03:42:56.819 align:start position:0%
in light of the amendment it appears to
 
03:43:00.309 --> 03:43:00.319 align:start position:0%
limit it to only loons and only within
 
03:43:05.030 --> 03:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:07.790 --> 03:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
so I I still I still like this
 
03:43:09.830 --> 03:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
find this bill in expedient to legislate
 
03:43:11.809 --> 03:43:11.819 align:start position:0%
as it's written and perhaps there's
 
03:43:13.670 --> 03:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
other thoughts on the amendment but my
 
03:43:16.969 --> 03:43:16.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:19.490 --> 03:43:19.500 align:start position:0%
as it is I'm not offering the amendment
 
03:43:19.500 --> 03:43:20.950 align:start position:0%
as it is I'm not offering the amendment
so

03:43:20.950 --> 03:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:43:27.050 --> 03:43:27.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:28.670 --> 03:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
representative harm
 
03:43:31.550 --> 03:43:31.560 align:start position:0%
in support of the motion of itl even
 
03:43:35.090 --> 03:43:35.100 align:start position:0%
with this proposed amendment
 
03:43:37.969 --> 03:43:37.979 align:start position:0%
well the amendment hasn't no it's been
 
03:43:40.190 --> 03:43:40.200 align:start position:0%
accepted to me it's Atlanta landowners
 
03:43:43.070 --> 03:43:43.080 align:start position:0%
rights issue and there's 10 criteria you
 
03:43:44.809 --> 03:43:44.819 align:start position:0%
have to notify the department and fish
 
03:43:46.309 --> 03:43:46.319 align:start position:0%
and game has lots of enforcement
 
03:43:49.309 --> 03:43:49.319 align:start position:0%
Provisions under 212a already
 
03:43:49.319 --> 03:43:51.710 align:start position:0%
Provisions under 212a already
and

03:43:51.710 --> 03:43:51.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:43:54.469 --> 03:43:54.479 align:start position:0%
the expert on docs and Doc commission
 
03:43:57.349 --> 03:43:57.359 align:start position:0%
opposes the bill we heard from him
 
03:43:59.510 --> 03:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
we've heard from a lot of landowners and
 
03:44:01.070 --> 03:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of Doc people and the temporary
 
03:44:03.590 --> 03:44:03.600 align:start position:0%
doc seasonal dock thing has worked
 
03:44:04.849 --> 03:44:04.859 align:start position:0%
pretty well and it's not going to
 
03:44:06.889 --> 03:44:06.899 align:start position:0%
prevent anybody from doing
 
03:44:06.899 --> 03:44:08.150 align:start position:0%
prevent anybody from doing
uh

03:44:08.150 --> 03:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:44:11.030 --> 03:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
what this bill aims to fix
 
03:44:11.040 --> 03:44:13.250 align:start position:0%
what this bill aims to fix
anyways

03:44:13.250 --> 03:44:13.260 align:start position:0%
anyways

thank you Mr chair so on the main motion
 
03:44:53.990 --> 03:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
um for the reasons I already stated I am
 
03:44:55.550 --> 03:44:55.560 align:start position:0%
not in agreement with the language of
 
03:44:58.729 --> 03:44:58.739 align:start position:0%
the bill as proposed or the need because
 
03:45:02.750 --> 03:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
of the other ability of Des to protect
 
03:45:05.750 --> 03:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
Wildlife so I would support the itl
 
03:45:07.969 --> 03:45:07.979 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:45:11.389 --> 03:45:11.399 align:start position:0%
anyone else Mr Speaker Mr and
 
03:45:13.070 --> 03:45:13.080 align:start position:0%
representative Darby been representative
 
03:45:15.710 --> 03:45:15.720 align:start position:0%
Rome thank you Mr chair
 
03:45:18.950 --> 03:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
um so that I definitely agree that
 
03:45:22.250 --> 03:45:22.260 align:start position:0%
um as I've uh discussed in the um you
 
03:45:24.530 --> 03:45:24.540 align:start position:0%
know in the original testimony that as
 
03:45:26.929 --> 03:45:26.939 align:start position:0%
written it's too broad
 
03:45:29.030 --> 03:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
um and the author
 
03:45:31.790 --> 03:45:31.800 align:start position:0%
um the sponsor was uh willing and as
 
03:45:36.950 --> 03:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
were numerous of the um the testifiers
 
03:45:39.410 --> 03:45:39.420 align:start position:0%
um to to clarify the language in fact
 
03:45:42.050 --> 03:45:42.060 align:start position:0%
there was many um I think all the
 
03:45:44.750 --> 03:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
support that came back said otpa get rid
 
03:45:47.690 --> 03:45:47.700 align:start position:0%
of the you know any wildlife
 
03:45:47.700 --> 03:45:48.650 align:start position:0%
of the you know any wildlife
um

03:45:48.650 --> 03:45:48.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:45:51.469 --> 03:45:51.479 align:start position:0%
I uh unfortunately
 
03:45:53.690 --> 03:45:53.700 align:start position:0%
um one of the um people that one of the
 
03:45:55.070 --> 03:45:55.080 align:start position:0%
groups that we really needed to hear
 
03:45:55.080 --> 03:45:56.389 align:start position:0%
groups that we really needed to hear
from

03:45:56.389 --> 03:45:56.399 align:start position:0%
from
 
03:45:58.729 --> 03:45:58.739 align:start position:0%
um during that original hearing was not
 
03:46:00.950 --> 03:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
available which was fish and game
 
03:46:03.950 --> 03:46:03.960 align:start position:0%
um but I noticed um that we have the
 
03:46:06.950 --> 03:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
honor of commissioner price from fish
 
03:46:09.110 --> 03:46:09.120 align:start position:0%
and game here and I wonder if maybe we
 
03:46:10.309 --> 03:46:10.319 align:start position:0%
could get
 
03:46:14.750 --> 03:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:14.760 --> 03:46:16.990 align:start position:0%
 
hey

03:46:16.990 --> 03:46:17.000 align:start position:0%
hey
 
03:46:20.870 --> 03:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
on if this bill if there's any way
 
03:46:23.630 --> 03:46:23.640 align:start position:0%
um if this bill really should be itl'd
 
03:46:25.070 --> 03:46:25.080 align:start position:0%
or not
 
03:46:27.530 --> 03:46:27.540 align:start position:0%
we're right in the middle
 
03:46:29.929 --> 03:46:29.939 align:start position:0%
but maybe we could have motion can we
 
03:46:32.809 --> 03:46:32.819 align:start position:0%
ask some questions uh in the middle of
 
03:46:34.910 --> 03:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
the motion it's
 
03:46:38.150 --> 03:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
uh I don't think so we're we're in a
 
03:46:40.130 --> 03:46:40.140 align:start position:0%
voting mode
 
03:46:45.590 --> 03:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh normally if if a questions before
 
03:46:48.830 --> 03:46:48.840 align:start position:0%
uh or be before we went into a voting
 
03:46:50.630 --> 03:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
mode or after
 
03:46:50.640 --> 03:46:52.250 align:start position:0%
mode or after
uh

03:46:52.250 --> 03:46:52.260 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:46:54.290 --> 03:46:54.300 align:start position:0%
we'll uh
 
03:46:57.830 --> 03:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
I will I'll allow
 
03:47:02.030 --> 03:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
going in on allow uh if if this defends
 
03:47:05.450 --> 03:47:05.460 align:start position:0%
how this bill how this motion
 
03:47:09.050 --> 03:47:09.060 align:start position:0%
if the passes or not well then
 
03:47:13.370 --> 03:47:13.380 align:start position:0%
it will still wait don't uh
 
03:47:16.370 --> 03:47:16.380 align:start position:0%
I know not not in a voting though no no
 
03:47:19.550 --> 03:47:19.560 align:start position:0%
I don't think I'm uh just for my own
 
03:47:22.370 --> 03:47:22.380 align:start position:0%
clarification uh Mr chair are there
 
03:47:24.349 --> 03:47:24.359 align:start position:0%
opportunities at your discretion of
 
03:47:27.410 --> 03:47:27.420 align:start position:0%
course where it's appropriate to ask um
 
03:47:29.210 --> 03:47:29.220 align:start position:0%
clarifying questions from members of the
 
03:47:29.220 --> 03:47:30.530 align:start position:0%
clarifying questions from members of the
audience

03:47:30.530 --> 03:47:30.540 align:start position:0%
audience
 
03:47:33.530 --> 03:47:33.540 align:start position:0%
if a clarifying question yes not
 
03:47:33.540 --> 03:47:34.910 align:start position:0%
if a clarifying question yes not
testimony

03:47:34.910 --> 03:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
03:47:37.729 --> 03:47:37.739 align:start position:0%
I I understand I I think I
 
03:47:39.950 --> 03:47:39.960 align:start position:0%
misrepresented what I was asking I would
 
03:47:41.570 --> 03:47:41.580 align:start position:0%
like to ask some clarifying questions I
 
03:47:44.809 --> 03:47:44.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:47.210 --> 03:47:47.220 align:start position:0%
are gonna have to call now I will call
 
03:47:47.220 --> 03:47:48.729 align:start position:0%
are gonna have to call now I will call
it

03:47:48.729 --> 03:47:48.739 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:47:50.769 --> 03:47:50.779 align:start position:0%
are we
 
03:47:53.389 --> 03:47:53.399 align:start position:0%
yeah we are at a voting mode I don't
 
03:47:56.030 --> 03:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
think uh I don't think it's for I don't
 
03:48:01.370 --> 03:48:01.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:05.210 --> 03:48:05.220 align:start position:0%
to um then to conclude I would
 
03:48:08.030 --> 03:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
um definitely vote against the Ito
 
03:48:10.910 --> 03:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
um this this bill can uh is it's not
 
03:48:13.309 --> 03:48:13.319 align:start position:0%
perfect but uh killing it for two years
 
03:48:14.990 --> 03:48:15.000 align:start position:0%
isn't appropriate we heard it across the
 
03:48:16.550 --> 03:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
board how
 
03:48:19.610 --> 03:48:19.620 align:start position:0%
um how important this is uh to loons how
 
03:48:22.670 --> 03:48:22.680 align:start position:0%
fragile uh loon nesting locations are if
 
03:48:25.070 --> 03:48:25.080 align:start position:0%
you look for example on the
 
03:48:27.530 --> 03:48:27.540 align:start position:0%
um on the Loon conservation commission's
 
03:48:30.830 --> 03:48:30.840 align:start position:0%
website uh loon nesting locations are
 
03:48:33.170 --> 03:48:33.180 align:start position:0%
not always marked intentionally although
 
03:48:35.769 --> 03:48:35.779 align:start position:0%
they are reported to Des
 
03:48:39.889 --> 03:48:39.899 align:start position:0%
and while this language is not is not
 
03:48:42.349 --> 03:48:42.359 align:start position:0%
perfect it's definitely not itl worthy
 
03:48:47.990 --> 03:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:48.000 --> 03:48:49.490 align:start position:0%
 
actually

03:48:49.490 --> 03:48:49.500 align:start position:0%
actually
 
03:48:54.530 --> 03:48:54.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:56.450 --> 03:48:56.460 align:start position:0%
I have two choices
 
03:48:58.630 --> 03:48:58.640 align:start position:0%
making a
 
03:49:01.610 --> 03:49:01.620 align:start position:0%
when a voting mode starts
 
03:49:04.370 --> 03:49:04.380 align:start position:0%
we we were not
 
03:49:06.950 --> 03:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
vote we we were in this we were
 
03:49:08.990 --> 03:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
discussing yes we it was before the
 
03:49:09.000 --> 03:49:10.309 align:start position:0%
discussing yes we it was before the
committee

03:49:10.309 --> 03:49:10.319 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:49:13.130 --> 03:49:13.140 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna have to reverse my decision
 
03:49:15.950 --> 03:49:15.960 align:start position:0%
and say we are
 
03:49:20.030 --> 03:49:20.040 align:start position:0%
you we're a voting mode we were not in
 
03:49:21.710 --> 03:49:21.720 align:start position:0%
the count
 
03:49:25.070 --> 03:49:25.080 align:start position:0%
that would be the voting vote no
 
03:49:27.769 --> 03:49:27.779 align:start position:0%
I think I made an error so
 
03:49:31.190 --> 03:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
I will let you ask a question
 
03:49:32.330 --> 03:49:32.340 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:49:33.889 --> 03:49:33.899 align:start position:0%
of the
 
03:49:38.210 --> 03:49:38.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:39.229 --> 03:49:39.239 align:start position:0%

03:49:59.269 --> 03:49:59.279 align:start position:0%

03:50:02.210 --> 03:50:02.220 align:start position:0%

uh yes we do
 
03:50:40.070 --> 03:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
does fish and game think that the
 
03:50:43.130 --> 03:50:43.140 align:start position:0%
language could be mended to make it um
 
03:50:46.610 --> 03:50:46.620 align:start position:0%
to satisfy Fish and Game concerns
 
03:50:46.620 --> 03:50:47.750 align:start position:0%

no I don't have any other questions
 
03:50:57.170 --> 03:50:57.180 align:start position:0%
well since fishing game has no concerns
 
03:51:03.590 --> 03:51:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:03.600 --> 03:51:04.870 align:start position:0%

03:51:59.990 --> 03:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
questions of their position
 
03:52:02.030 --> 03:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
I I understand
 
03:52:03.830 --> 03:52:03.840 align:start position:0%
um my my point
 
03:52:05.630 --> 03:52:05.640 align:start position:0%
um is that
 
03:52:09.410 --> 03:52:09.420 align:start position:0%
um as I so first I would I would suggest
 
03:52:09.420 --> 03:52:11.450 align:start position:0%
um as I so first I would I would suggest
that

03:52:11.450 --> 03:52:11.460 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:52:15.410 --> 03:52:15.420 align:start position:0%
um any testimony after
 
03:52:17.750 --> 03:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
um you know testimony is always in order
 
03:52:17.760 --> 03:52:19.429 align:start position:0%
um you know testimony is always in order
and

03:52:19.429 --> 03:52:19.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:52:21.110 --> 03:52:21.120 align:start position:0%
um people that testify before a
 
03:52:22.910 --> 03:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
subsequent testifier you know can't
 
03:52:24.290 --> 03:52:24.300 align:start position:0%
comment on it so there's always an
 
03:52:27.530 --> 03:52:27.540 align:start position:0%
ordering but besides that
 
03:52:31.190 --> 03:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
um uh my the point of calling of asking
 
03:52:33.710 --> 03:52:33.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner price this question
 
03:52:38.450 --> 03:52:38.460 align:start position:0%
was not um to to uh ways to get clarity
 
03:52:42.050 --> 03:52:42.060 align:start position:0%
on itl itl basically is uh because
 
03:52:43.550 --> 03:52:43.560 align:start position:0%
there's other options in front of us
 
03:52:44.750 --> 03:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
that we haven't considered yet other
 
03:52:44.760 --> 03:52:46.610 align:start position:0%
that we haven't considered yet other
motions

03:52:46.610 --> 03:52:46.620 align:start position:0%
motions
 
03:52:49.849 --> 03:52:49.859 align:start position:0%
um and I wanted to get her position I
 
03:52:52.910 --> 03:52:52.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to get the position on whether or
 
03:52:56.030 --> 03:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
not the bill could be saved
 
03:52:59.330 --> 03:52:59.340 align:start position:0%
um which is what I heard and there and
 
03:53:01.130 --> 03:53:01.140 align:start position:0%
so I was trying I got my answer on
 
03:53:02.990 --> 03:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
whether or not we should go to itl which
 
03:53:06.410 --> 03:53:06.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:06.420 --> 03:53:16.490 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:53:16.490 --> 03:53:16.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:19.370 --> 03:53:19.380 align:start position:0%
that is not no yes or no questions
 
03:53:22.429 --> 03:53:22.439 align:start position:0%
aren't necessarily A
 
03:53:27.050 --> 03:53:27.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:30.469 --> 03:53:30.479 align:start position:0%
you you had a specific question a
 
03:53:30.479 --> 03:53:32.389 align:start position:0%
you you had a specific question a
clarification

03:53:32.389 --> 03:53:32.399 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
03:53:36.849 --> 03:53:36.859 align:start position:0%
that's well all that you can do in
 
03:53:41.809 --> 03:53:41.819 align:start position:0%
executive session is to clarify and if
 
03:53:45.110 --> 03:53:45.120 align:start position:0%
there's a get clarification
 
03:53:46.610 --> 03:53:46.620 align:start position:0%
on something
 
03:53:50.269 --> 03:53:50.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:52.729 --> 03:53:52.739 align:start position:0%
you cannot elicit
 
03:53:55.370 --> 03:53:55.380 align:start position:0%
new testimony
 
03:53:57.830 --> 03:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
from uh from someone from the floor
 
03:53:57.840 --> 03:53:59.870 align:start position:0%
from uh from someone from the floor
during

03:53:59.870 --> 03:53:59.880 align:start position:0%
during
 
03:53:59.880 --> 03:54:02.690 align:start position:0%
during
the

03:54:02.690 --> 03:54:02.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:10.190 --> 03:54:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:10.200 --> 03:54:11.450 align:start position:0%
 
that's

03:54:11.450 --> 03:54:11.460 align:start position:0%
that's
 
03:54:15.050 --> 03:54:15.060 align:start position:0%
so that's the rules as I understand
 
03:54:17.870 --> 03:54:17.880 align:start position:0%
but then again there's always like you
 
03:54:21.349 --> 03:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
know and this time I'm not calling this
 
03:54:21.359 --> 03:54:22.670 align:start position:0%
know and this time I'm not calling this
but

03:54:22.670 --> 03:54:22.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:54:22.680 --> 03:54:25.030 align:start position:0%
but
so

03:54:25.030 --> 03:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:54:26.929 --> 03:54:26.939 align:start position:0%
now I
 
03:54:29.570 --> 03:54:29.580 align:start position:0%
your rights are you could challenge the
 
03:54:31.790 --> 03:54:31.800 align:start position:0%
ruling of the chair but I bet you it's
 
03:54:35.469 --> 03:54:35.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:37.750 --> 03:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
i i i
 
03:54:41.450 --> 03:54:41.460 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman are we taking testimony
 
03:54:43.550 --> 03:54:43.560 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman are we taking testimony from
 
03:54:45.050 --> 03:54:45.060 align:start position:0%
the Department in during executive
 
03:54:47.450 --> 03:54:47.460 align:start position:0%
session yeah so is there additional
 
03:54:49.849 --> 03:54:49.859 align:start position:0%
opportunity to ask questions or do we
 
03:54:57.530 --> 03:54:57.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:00.650 --> 03:55:00.660 align:start position:0%
no no of that you can that you can uh if
 
03:55:02.929 --> 03:55:02.939 align:start position:0%
you're if it's a question or if there's
 
03:55:04.969 --> 03:55:04.979 align:start position:0%
a player if you need a clarification on
 
03:55:07.670 --> 03:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:10.610 --> 03:55:10.620 align:start position:0%
they get they can
 
03:55:14.030 --> 03:55:14.040 align:start position:0%
they they can
 
03:55:17.090 --> 03:55:17.100 align:start position:0%
ants at they can answer
 
03:55:20.990 --> 03:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
uh if if uh if I if I ruled that there
 
03:55:23.150 --> 03:55:23.160 align:start position:0%
it's a clarification
 
03:55:26.090 --> 03:55:26.100 align:start position:0%
and they and also that they wish they
 
03:55:27.590 --> 03:55:27.600 align:start position:0%
would wish to answer they don't have to
 
03:55:29.450 --> 03:55:29.460 align:start position:0%
answer well it may ask a question then
 
03:55:31.550 --> 03:55:31.560 align:start position:0%
of the of the department as a forward
 
03:55:34.250 --> 03:55:34.260 align:start position:0%
clarification for a clarification
 
03:55:36.650 --> 03:55:36.660 align:start position:0%
clarification on the the statues that I
 
03:55:38.570 --> 03:55:38.580 align:start position:0%
referenced earlier in my
 
03:55:41.469 --> 03:55:41.479 align:start position:0%
my discussion
 
03:55:44.929 --> 03:55:44.939 align:start position:0%
on their ability to enforce 212.
 
03:55:48.530 --> 03:55:48.540 align:start position:0%
yeah I think you could you could see is
 
03:55:51.469 --> 03:55:51.479 align:start position:0%
that and 212 is in the conservation act
 
03:55:53.090 --> 03:55:53.100 align:start position:0%
that's referenced in and the bill is
 
03:55:54.950 --> 03:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
written okay because I made some
 
03:56:02.809 --> 03:56:02.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:04.790 --> 03:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
03:56:08.030 --> 03:56:08.040 align:start position:0%
could you Enlighten us a little bit if
 
03:56:11.510 --> 03:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
if somebody placed a temporary Dock and
 
03:56:14.210 --> 03:56:14.220 align:start position:0%
they placed it in properly under
 
03:56:15.830 --> 03:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
the endangered species conservation act
 
03:56:20.689 --> 03:56:20.699 align:start position:0%
RSA 212a how would you enforce that
 
03:56:23.630 --> 03:56:23.640 align:start position:0%
to protect under existing statute if we
 
03:56:27.110 --> 03:56:27.120 align:start position:0%
didn't pass this how would you enforce
 
03:56:29.330 --> 03:56:29.340 align:start position:0%
and protect the endangered species or
 
03:56:31.490 --> 03:56:31.500 align:start position:0%
threatened species under RSA 212a what
 
03:56:33.050 --> 03:56:33.060 align:start position:0%
powers do you currently have without us
 
03:56:35.150 --> 03:56:35.160 align:start position:0%
doing anything we want to make sure that
 
03:56:37.429 --> 03:56:37.439 align:start position:0%
we're there protected so yeah under
 
03:56:39.110 --> 03:56:39.120 align:start position:0%
existing RSA
 
03:56:41.269 --> 03:56:41.279 align:start position:0%
um we if if anything that that someone
 
03:56:42.889 --> 03:56:42.899 align:start position:0%
does the results in the take of a
 
03:56:44.389 --> 03:56:44.399 align:start position:0%
threatened or endangered species we do
 
03:56:46.610 --> 03:56:46.620 align:start position:0%
have enforcement Authority
 
03:56:48.170 --> 03:56:48.180 align:start position:0%
um specifically how that would play out
 
03:56:50.809 --> 03:56:50.819 align:start position:0%
would depend on the situation but but if
 
03:56:52.610 --> 03:56:52.620 align:start position:0%
we were made aware of a take which
 
03:56:54.410 --> 03:56:54.420 align:start position:0%
there's a definition of in our rules and
 
03:56:57.050 --> 03:56:57.060 align:start position:0%
I believe in the RSA we would have
 
03:56:59.210 --> 03:56:59.220 align:start position:0%
enforcement Authority
 
03:57:01.189 --> 03:57:01.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for making us feel better
 
03:57:04.370 --> 03:57:04.380 align:start position:0%
about that and so if the itl passes and
 
03:57:05.570 --> 03:57:05.580 align:start position:0%
a take would be something like if
 
03:57:07.729 --> 03:57:07.739 align:start position:0%
somebody ran over the dock
 
03:57:10.070 --> 03:57:10.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you do you
 
03:57:12.710 --> 03:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
have a question on what testimony that
 
03:57:12.720 --> 03:57:14.929 align:start position:0%
have a question on what testimony that
just

03:57:14.929 --> 03:57:14.939 align:start position:0%
just
 
03:57:16.189 --> 03:57:16.199 align:start position:0%
um yes I was just hoping you could
 
03:57:18.349 --> 03:57:18.359 align:start position:0%
clarify what take means
 
03:57:20.090 --> 03:57:20.100 align:start position:0%
um there's a definition of what take is
 
03:57:23.510 --> 03:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
so it can be harm distress kill it's
 
03:57:27.410 --> 03:57:27.420 align:start position:0%
it's fairly broad it's not just um it's
 
03:57:29.090 --> 03:57:29.100 align:start position:0%
not just resulting in the death of an
 
03:57:31.910 --> 03:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
animal so it it there's a quite a broad
 
03:57:34.910 --> 03:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
definition of what take is
 
03:57:38.870 --> 03:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman parliamentary inquiry
 
03:57:38.880 --> 03:57:40.250 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman parliamentary inquiry
right

03:57:40.250 --> 03:57:40.260 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:57:44.750 --> 03:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman so if you feel comfortable
 
03:57:46.670 --> 03:57:46.680 align:start position:0%
and agree with me
 
03:57:49.729 --> 03:57:49.739 align:start position:0%
that there's significant protection for
 
03:57:51.950 --> 03:57:51.960 align:start position:0%
these endangered and threatened species
 
03:57:53.630 --> 03:57:53.640 align:start position:0%
currently in law and if you agree with
 
03:57:55.490 --> 03:57:55.500 align:start position:0%
me then you would have vote would you
 
03:57:57.950 --> 03:57:57.960 align:start position:0%
then vote with me and the rest of the
 
03:57:59.990 --> 03:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
committee to find this bill and
 
03:58:02.809 --> 03:58:02.819 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate
 
03:58:05.929 --> 03:58:05.939 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry no that's not
 
03:58:08.450 --> 03:58:08.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
03:58:10.790 --> 03:58:10.800 align:start position:0%
call the question
 
03:58:12.530 --> 03:58:12.540 align:start position:0%
no there's no calling of the question
 
03:58:14.990 --> 03:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
and if
 
03:58:15.000 --> 03:58:18.469 align:start position:0%
and if
committee

03:58:18.469 --> 03:58:18.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:21.849 --> 03:58:21.859 align:start position:0%
representative Lamontagne
 
03:58:24.410 --> 03:58:24.420 align:start position:0%
as I understand
 
03:58:26.330 --> 03:58:26.340 align:start position:0%
the spell
 
03:58:27.889 --> 03:58:27.899 align:start position:0%
if we
 
03:58:30.290 --> 03:58:30.300 align:start position:0%
um say we're to include the amended
 
03:58:30.300 --> 03:58:32.030 align:start position:0%
um say we're to include the amended
language

03:58:32.030 --> 03:58:32.040 align:start position:0%
language
 
03:58:35.269 --> 03:58:35.279 align:start position:0%
it's still not saying that someone can't
 
03:58:38.630 --> 03:58:38.640 align:start position:0%
put a temporary Doc in it only means
 
03:58:42.349 --> 03:58:42.359 align:start position:0%
that they have to get a special permit
 
03:58:45.290 --> 03:58:45.300 align:start position:0%
they can't go through the exemption by
 
03:58:47.750 --> 03:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
just notifying the department
 
03:58:50.929 --> 03:58:50.939 align:start position:0%
they have to get permit and
 
03:58:52.910 --> 03:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
I think
 
03:58:56.210 --> 03:58:56.220 align:start position:0%
with regarding the other language
 
03:58:56.220 --> 03:58:56.809 align:start position:0%
with regarding the other language
um

03:58:56.809 --> 03:58:56.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:59:00.290 --> 03:59:00.300 align:start position:0%
that fish and game could take recourses
 
03:59:00.300 --> 03:59:01.370 align:start position:0%
that fish and game could take recourses
um

03:59:01.370 --> 03:59:01.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:59:04.309 --> 03:59:04.319 align:start position:0%
for an injury that already happened the
 
03:59:06.650 --> 03:59:06.660 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill is to try to prevent
 
03:59:09.650 --> 03:59:09.660 align:start position:0%
the injury to the loons to begin with by
 
03:59:12.530 --> 03:59:12.540 align:start position:0%
being more careful of where we put the
 
03:59:15.710 --> 03:59:15.720 align:start position:0%
temporary dock it's not saying nobody
 
03:59:17.330 --> 03:59:17.340 align:start position:0%
could put a docket
 
03:59:20.630 --> 03:59:20.640 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding and that's why I
 
03:59:22.910 --> 03:59:22.920 align:start position:0%
don't want to see um
 
03:59:26.750 --> 03:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
the spell itl and I think it can be
 
03:59:26.760 --> 03:59:29.150 align:start position:0%
the spell itl and I think it can be
saved

03:59:29.150 --> 03:59:29.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:32.570 --> 03:59:32.580 align:start position:0%
what else was just
 
03:59:35.469 --> 03:59:35.479 align:start position:0%
testimony by anyone else
 
03:59:38.469 --> 03:59:38.479 align:start position:0%
representative representative bailed in
 
03:59:42.229 --> 03:59:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:44.510 --> 03:59:44.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'll be voting
 
03:59:47.210 --> 03:59:47.220 align:start position:0%
against a motion of itl um today I think
 
03:59:48.830 --> 03:59:48.840 align:start position:0%
this is an important bill
 
03:59:52.729 --> 03:59:52.739 align:start position:0%
um and I can tell you that
 
03:59:55.250 --> 03:59:55.260 align:start position:0%
when the Audubon Society comes out and
 
03:59:57.889 --> 03:59:57.899 align:start position:0%
wants to work with us to help with the
 
04:00:00.469 --> 04:00:00.479 align:start position:0%
loons I'm always going to be one of
 
04:00:02.929 --> 04:00:02.939 align:start position:0%
those people that really wants to help
 
04:00:05.150 --> 04:00:05.160 align:start position:0%
them back and I think the language
 
04:00:07.550 --> 04:00:07.560 align:start position:0%
change that was asked for during the
 
04:00:07.560 --> 04:00:08.650 align:start position:0%
change that was asked for during the
hearing

04:00:08.650 --> 04:00:08.660 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
04:00:12.290 --> 04:00:12.300 align:start position:0%
regarding Wildlife we had the New
 
04:00:13.849 --> 04:00:13.859 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Lakes management advisory
 
04:00:13.859 --> 04:00:15.410 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Lakes management advisory
committee

04:00:15.410 --> 04:00:15.420 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:00:18.170 --> 04:00:18.180 align:start position:0%
weigh in on that and I do believe that
 
04:00:18.180 --> 04:00:19.010 align:start position:0%
weigh in on that and I do believe that
the

04:00:19.010 --> 04:00:19.020 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:00:21.469 --> 04:00:21.479 align:start position:0%
the change in the language where loons
 
04:00:24.290 --> 04:00:24.300 align:start position:0%
are a threatened species turning that
 
04:00:27.290 --> 04:00:27.300 align:start position:0%
put using this amendment that were what
 
04:00:29.090 --> 04:00:29.100 align:start position:0%
we're looking at is going to take care
 
04:00:31.610 --> 04:00:31.620 align:start position:0%
of the language problems that that
 
04:00:33.830 --> 04:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
anyone who was there might have had for
 
04:00:36.290 --> 04:00:36.300 align:start position:0%
this I think I think this bill has Merit
 
04:00:40.070 --> 04:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
and I I want to just reiterate that New
 
04:00:42.830 --> 04:00:42.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Audubon and as well as the
 
04:00:44.809 --> 04:00:44.819 align:start position:0%
Loon Society
 
04:00:47.210 --> 04:00:47.220 align:start position:0%
prevent preservation committee and all
 
04:00:48.710 --> 04:00:48.720 align:start position:0%
the people that have been working so
 
04:00:50.870 --> 04:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
hard for for all of this time have only
 
04:00:52.729 --> 04:00:52.739 align:start position:0%
been able to make so much progress with
 
04:00:55.250 --> 04:00:55.260 align:start position:0%
the Loon population and we have a lot of
 
04:00:56.929 --> 04:00:56.939 align:start position:0%
things that have come through this
 
04:01:00.229 --> 04:01:00.239 align:start position:0%
committee over the past few months that
 
04:01:02.870 --> 04:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
um really clearly show us that the
 
04:01:04.490 --> 04:01:04.500 align:start position:0%
impact from the environment is
 
04:01:06.710 --> 04:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
accelerating and the fact that we have
 
04:01:08.750 --> 04:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
wounds we don't know what's going on
 
04:01:11.510 --> 04:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
with them what their reactions to a lot
 
04:01:13.189 --> 04:01:13.199 align:start position:0%
of the threats that they have but this
 
04:01:16.429 --> 04:01:16.439 align:start position:0%
is a shorebird and we are protecting
 
04:01:18.769 --> 04:01:18.779 align:start position:0%
where they nest and it's at a critical
 
04:01:21.410 --> 04:01:21.420 align:start position:0%
time and if we don't move ahead with
 
04:01:23.150 --> 04:01:23.160 align:start position:0%
this we won't be able to maintain the
 
04:01:25.610 --> 04:01:25.620 align:start position:0%
population that we have now and so
 
04:01:28.969 --> 04:01:28.979 align:start position:0%
that's my testimony in opposition to a
 
04:01:32.389 --> 04:01:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:34.550 --> 04:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
anyone else would accept representative
 
04:01:36.950 --> 04:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
Brown thank you Mr chair
 
04:01:41.150 --> 04:01:41.160 align:start position:0%
I'm also opposed to the itl based on the
 
04:01:43.729 --> 04:01:43.739 align:start position:0%
amendment that hopefully I'll get to
 
04:01:46.490 --> 04:01:46.500 align:start position:0%
introduce during testimony of this bill
 
04:01:48.950 --> 04:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
and the public hearing the
 
04:01:53.030 --> 04:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
the concerns raised by most of the
 
04:01:55.250 --> 04:01:55.260 align:start position:0%
people testifying were that it was too
 
04:01:58.670 --> 04:01:58.680 align:start position:0%
vague and it wasn't specific it would be
 
04:02:02.090 --> 04:02:02.100 align:start position:0%
really subjective and to be able to
 
04:02:05.150 --> 04:02:05.160 align:start position:0%
assess when an endangered species is
 
04:02:07.790 --> 04:02:07.800 align:start position:0%
threatened but the con the specific
 
04:02:10.969 --> 04:02:10.979 align:start position:0%
concerns that were raised by the the
 
04:02:13.429 --> 04:02:13.439 align:start position:0%
people testifying had to do with loon
 
04:02:15.170 --> 04:02:15.180 align:start position:0%
specifically and if we look at the
 
04:02:17.510 --> 04:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
written testimony that was submitted it
 
04:02:19.370 --> 04:02:19.380 align:start position:0%
was the same is true of the Lakes
 
04:02:21.650 --> 04:02:21.660 align:start position:0%
management advisory committee The Loon
 
04:02:23.510 --> 04:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
preservation commission and the Audubon
 
04:02:26.929 --> 04:02:26.939 align:start position:0%
they all talked about the loons so that
 
04:02:28.969 --> 04:02:28.979 align:start position:0%
was the impetus for representative
 
04:02:31.010 --> 04:02:31.020 align:start position:0%
Crawford to bring forth this amendment
 
04:02:34.250 --> 04:02:34.260 align:start position:0%
just to address that specific concern
 
04:02:36.469 --> 04:02:36.479 align:start position:0%
and if you look at the letter by the New
 
04:02:38.330 --> 04:02:38.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Lakes management advisory
 
04:02:40.309 --> 04:02:40.319 align:start position:0%
committee of which commissioner price is
 
04:02:42.889 --> 04:02:42.899 align:start position:0%
a member along with Bia and a very broad
 
04:02:46.729 --> 04:02:46.739 align:start position:0%
range of people they that group supports
 
04:02:49.490 --> 04:02:49.500 align:start position:0%
this amendment they say
 
04:02:51.889 --> 04:02:51.899 align:start position:0%
um as a result we support the bill with
 
04:02:55.189 --> 04:02:55.199 align:start position:0%
either two amendments one to allow
 
04:02:57.110 --> 04:02:57.120 align:start position:0%
either allow permit exemptions when a
 
04:02:59.929 --> 04:02:59.939 align:start position:0%
temporary seasonal dock does not affect
 
04:03:03.229 --> 04:03:03.239 align:start position:0%
common loans so this is an amendment
 
04:03:05.990 --> 04:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
that would allow that well it's the
 
04:03:08.210 --> 04:03:08.220 align:start position:0%
converse is true this would be allowing
 
04:03:11.330 --> 04:03:11.340 align:start position:0%
temporary docs that don't impact loon
 
04:03:14.269 --> 04:03:14.279 align:start position:0%
nesting but it would prohibit temporary
 
04:03:16.550 --> 04:03:16.560 align:start position:0%
docs from infringing within a hundred
 
04:03:19.370 --> 04:03:19.380 align:start position:0%
and feet of a loon's nest so I hope the
 
04:03:22.610 --> 04:03:22.620 align:start position:0%
committee defeats the itl so that this
 
04:03:25.250 --> 04:03:25.260 align:start position:0%
amendment in an otpa motion can be made
 
04:03:27.469 --> 04:03:27.479 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:03:30.650 --> 04:03:30.660 align:start position:0%
anywhere else wish to speak
 
04:03:34.070 --> 04:03:34.080 align:start position:0%

04:03:37.189 --> 04:03:37.199 align:start position:0%

04:06:37.250 --> 04:06:37.260 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair as we heard during the
 
04:06:40.849 --> 04:06:40.859 align:start position:0%
public hearing the concerns it raised
 
04:06:44.269 --> 04:06:44.279 align:start position:0%
about the bill as introduced were vague
 
04:06:47.870 --> 04:06:47.880 align:start position:0%
not specific but there was a lot of
 
04:06:51.170 --> 04:06:51.180 align:start position:0%
concern about loons and so this
 
04:06:53.570 --> 04:06:53.580 align:start position:0%
amendment drafted by representative
 
04:06:56.689 --> 04:06:56.699 align:start position:0%
Crawford who was the Prime sponsor of
 
04:06:59.689 --> 04:06:59.699 align:start position:0%
the original Bill Narrows that and is
 
04:07:03.170 --> 04:07:03.180 align:start position:0%
extremely specific that temporary dogs
 
04:07:05.929 --> 04:07:05.939 align:start position:0%
would be prohibited in areas that will
 
04:07:09.830 --> 04:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
impact loon nesting or with 150 feet of
 
04:07:14.330 --> 04:07:14.340 align:start position:0%
loon nesting we also heard from The Loon
 
04:07:14.340 --> 04:07:16.490 align:start position:0%
loon nesting we also heard from The Loon
protection

04:07:16.490 --> 04:07:16.500 align:start position:0%
protection
 
04:07:19.189 --> 04:07:19.199 align:start position:0%
um hold on the Loon production committee
 
04:07:21.769 --> 04:07:21.779 align:start position:0%
or preservation commission thank you or
 
04:07:25.429 --> 04:07:25.439 align:start position:0%
committee that there is very very
 
04:07:29.150 --> 04:07:29.160 align:start position:0%
specific procedures to identify where
 
04:07:31.370 --> 04:07:31.380 align:start position:0%
these loon nests are and assign them GPS
 
04:07:34.070 --> 04:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
coordinates so it really assists Des
 
04:07:38.389 --> 04:07:38.399 align:start position:0%
with being able to pinpoint specific
 
04:07:41.410 --> 04:07:41.420 align:start position:0%
locations where these docs may impact
 
04:07:44.450 --> 04:07:44.460 align:start position:0%
loons which we all know are endangered
 
04:07:46.610 --> 04:07:46.620 align:start position:0%
and they're a real icon of our state
 
04:07:51.349 --> 04:07:51.359 align:start position:0%
that we should protect that data goes to
 
04:07:53.630 --> 04:07:53.640 align:start position:0%
the National Heritage and it sets those
 
04:07:56.510 --> 04:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
coordinates so I think the concerns
 
04:07:58.969 --> 04:07:58.979 align:start position:0%
about vagueness and
 
04:07:58.979 --> 04:08:00.590 align:start position:0%
about vagueness and
um

04:08:00.590 --> 04:08:00.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:02.990 --> 04:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
broad terminology when we talk about
 
04:08:05.389 --> 04:08:05.399 align:start position:0%
threatened species or endangered species
 
04:08:07.849 --> 04:08:07.859 align:start position:0%
is addressed and solved through this
 
04:08:09.950 --> 04:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
amendment so I would encourage the
 
04:08:14.090 --> 04:08:14.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:16.729 --> 04:08:16.739 align:start position:0%
pretty much thirst anyone wish to speak
 
04:08:19.670 --> 04:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
to their second
 
04:08:22.309 --> 04:08:22.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:08:22.319 --> 04:08:23.450 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

04:08:23.450 --> 04:08:23.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:24.889 --> 04:08:24.899 align:start position:0%
I'm never going to miss an opportunity
 
04:08:27.710 --> 04:08:27.720 align:start position:0%
to tell you what I know about loons
 
04:08:29.389 --> 04:08:29.399 align:start position:0%
and I hope to get everyone in the room
 
04:08:32.689 --> 04:08:32.699 align:start position:0%
on the Loon Cam over the summer when the
 
04:08:35.330 --> 04:08:35.340 align:start position:0%
nests are out there and I can tell you
 
04:08:38.269 --> 04:08:38.279 align:start position:0%
that what the Loon preservation
 
04:08:40.429 --> 04:08:40.439 align:start position:0%
committee has done is that they have
 
04:08:44.210 --> 04:08:44.220 align:start position:0%
identified nesting areas where
 
04:08:46.490 --> 04:08:46.500 align:start position:0%
they're not
 
04:08:50.090 --> 04:08:50.100 align:start position:0%
able to support a natural Nest any
 
04:08:52.429 --> 04:08:52.439 align:start position:0%
longer because of changes in the
 
04:08:56.389 --> 04:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
shoreline or changes in what is going on
 
04:08:58.670 --> 04:08:58.680 align:start position:0%
in those buffer zones that are that are
 
04:09:01.849 --> 04:09:01.859 align:start position:0%
just close to where the birds nest
 
04:09:01.859 --> 04:09:02.450 align:start position:0%
just close to where the birds nest
um

04:09:02.450 --> 04:09:02.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:04.189 --> 04:09:04.199 align:start position:0%
as you may have heard or as you may not
 
04:09:06.650 --> 04:09:06.660 align:start position:0%
have heard loons are
 
04:09:08.870 --> 04:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
a bird that spends most of their life on
 
04:09:11.570 --> 04:09:11.580 align:start position:0%
the water they don't have legs for land
 
04:09:14.510 --> 04:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
they have legs that swim and they swim
 
04:09:16.429 --> 04:09:16.439 align:start position:0%
fast and they dive and they fish and
 
04:09:18.110 --> 04:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
they feed their family
 
04:09:21.170 --> 04:09:21.180 align:start position:0%
for a lake to have
 
04:09:23.389 --> 04:09:23.399 align:start position:0%
Looms on it
 
04:09:25.429 --> 04:09:25.439 align:start position:0%
means that there has to be food in the
 
04:09:27.010 --> 04:09:27.020 align:start position:0%
lake there has to be
 
04:09:29.330 --> 04:09:29.340 align:start position:0%
the kind of environment that would
 
04:09:31.610 --> 04:09:31.620 align:start position:0%
support them and in the places where
 
04:09:33.889 --> 04:09:33.899 align:start position:0%
there is no longer an environment that
 
04:09:36.469 --> 04:09:36.479 align:start position:0%
supports a pairing a loon pairing in
 
04:09:37.550 --> 04:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
their nest
 
04:09:40.250 --> 04:09:40.260 align:start position:0%
what they do is they put out a nest
 
04:09:43.429 --> 04:09:43.439 align:start position:0%
that's on a raft and those nests are
 
04:09:47.630 --> 04:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
followed as well and that couple has a
 
04:09:49.910 --> 04:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
better chance in a territory that is no
 
04:09:52.189 --> 04:09:52.199 align:start position:0%
longer going to be viable because
 
04:09:54.110 --> 04:09:54.120 align:start position:0%
there's been a failure of a nest year
 
04:09:55.429 --> 04:09:55.439 align:start position:0%
after year
 
04:09:59.870 --> 04:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
loans only give birth to two eggs
 
04:10:02.630 --> 04:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
and so it's a really big job for the
 
04:10:06.290 --> 04:10:06.300 align:start position:0%
parents they have about 24 hours to get
 
04:10:07.849 --> 04:10:07.859 align:start position:0%
those little ones
 
04:10:10.429 --> 04:10:10.439 align:start position:0%
to stop picking on each other and to eat
 
04:10:13.429 --> 04:10:13.439 align:start position:0%
and they spend the rest of their life on
 
04:10:16.130 --> 04:10:16.140 align:start position:0%
the water so we're we're talking about a
 
04:10:18.349 --> 04:10:18.359 align:start position:0%
short amount of time when the moons
 
04:10:20.090 --> 04:10:20.100 align:start position:0%
begin to nest and when they begin to
 
04:10:23.750 --> 04:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
incubate and once the hatch is
 
04:10:26.269 --> 04:10:26.279 align:start position:0%
is taking place
 
04:10:26.279 --> 04:10:26.870 align:start position:0%
is taking place
um

04:10:26.870 --> 04:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:31.429 --> 04:10:31.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:33.469 --> 04:10:33.479 align:start position:0%
they would leave and it would be okay
 
04:10:35.689 --> 04:10:35.699 align:start position:0%
for a person to put in their temporary
 
04:10:38.450 --> 04:10:38.460 align:start position:0%
dock or to do whatever it is they need
 
04:10:40.070 --> 04:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
to do to their temporary doc that
 
04:10:41.510 --> 04:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
couldn't be done during the nesting
 
04:10:41.520 --> 04:10:43.189 align:start position:0%
couldn't be done during the nesting
season

04:10:43.189 --> 04:10:43.199 align:start position:0%
season
 
04:10:46.550 --> 04:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
so I support you know I really think we
 
04:10:48.290 --> 04:10:48.300 align:start position:0%
need to pass this I think we need to
 
04:10:51.110 --> 04:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
recognize that loons are a sentinel and
 
04:10:53.870 --> 04:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
Environmental Quality and that is
 
04:10:55.309 --> 04:10:55.319 align:start position:0%
something that you would learn if you
 
04:10:57.050 --> 04:10:57.060 align:start position:0%
spend some time at the Loon preservation
 
04:10:59.689 --> 04:10:59.699 align:start position:0%
committee and the health of the Loon is
 
04:11:01.790 --> 04:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
very indicative of the health of other
 
04:11:05.030 --> 04:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
wildlife and of us as beings in New
 
04:11:05.040 --> 04:11:06.410 align:start position:0%
wildlife and of us as beings in New
Hampshire

04:11:06.410 --> 04:11:06.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:11:06.420 --> 04:11:07.849 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
so

04:11:07.849 --> 04:11:07.859 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:11:11.870 --> 04:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
basically what we want is not asking a
 
04:11:13.670 --> 04:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
lot it may be asking a lot of one
 
04:11:16.610 --> 04:11:16.620 align:start position:0%
property owner but where one pair of
 
04:11:16.620 --> 04:11:17.750 align:start position:0%
property owner but where one pair of
loons

04:11:17.750 --> 04:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
loons
 
04:11:20.450 --> 04:11:20.460 align:start position:0%
takes up so much of of the territory
 
04:11:22.910 --> 04:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
that they need to have food they need to
 
04:11:22.920 --> 04:11:23.750 align:start position:0%
that they need to have food they need to
have

04:11:23.750 --> 04:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:11:23.760 --> 04:11:25.010 align:start position:0%
have
um

04:11:25.010 --> 04:11:25.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:26.990 --> 04:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
they need to be able to survive on that
 
04:11:29.450 --> 04:11:29.460 align:start position:0%
Lake it needs to have a brooding area it
 
04:11:30.769 --> 04:11:30.779 align:start position:0%
needs to have
 
04:11:30.779 --> 04:11:31.790 align:start position:0%
needs to have
um

04:11:31.790 --> 04:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:34.490 --> 04:11:34.500 align:start position:0%
just the one pair of looms and they are
 
04:11:37.070 --> 04:11:37.080 align:start position:0%
very territorial this is there it's not
 
04:11:39.349 --> 04:11:39.359 align:start position:0%
about a romance although you say see the
 
04:11:41.269 --> 04:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
same pairings year after year after year
 
04:11:43.550 --> 04:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
it's about the survival of wounds coming
 
04:11:46.189 --> 04:11:46.199 align:start position:0%
from that territory and loons are so
 
04:11:48.590 --> 04:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
driven to go back to that same exact
 
04:11:50.870 --> 04:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
spot that we need to make sure that
 
04:11:53.210 --> 04:11:53.220 align:start position:0%
those places are available for them to
 
04:11:53.220 --> 04:11:53.929 align:start position:0%
those places are available for them to
come

04:11:53.929 --> 04:11:53.939 align:start position:0%
come
 
04:11:56.269 --> 04:11:56.279 align:start position:0%
to have a Loon Lake with no wounds on it
 
04:11:58.130 --> 04:11:58.140 align:start position:0%
is not something that we want to see we
 
04:11:59.450 --> 04:11:59.460 align:start position:0%
want to bring the loons back to the
 
04:12:00.769 --> 04:12:00.779 align:start position:0%
Lakes where we know the Lakes have
 
04:12:02.570 --> 04:12:02.580 align:start position:0%
supported them in the past and we want
 
04:12:05.450 --> 04:12:05.460 align:start position:0%
them to be able to flourish there and to
 
04:12:08.809 --> 04:12:08.819 align:start position:0%
recover and as we as time goes on
 
04:12:12.170 --> 04:12:12.180 align:start position:0%
when an elderly loon dies or no longer
 
04:12:16.010 --> 04:12:16.020 align:start position:0%
begins to you know no longer nests then
 
04:12:19.309 --> 04:12:19.319 align:start position:0%
that the replacement of moons in the
 
04:12:21.590 --> 04:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
population in order for them to try to
 
04:12:23.210 --> 04:12:23.220 align:start position:0%
restore the populations that we
 
04:12:25.370 --> 04:12:25.380 align:start position:0%
previously had is very painstaking
 
04:12:25.380 --> 04:12:26.689 align:start position:0%
previously had is very painstaking
process

04:12:26.689 --> 04:12:26.699 align:start position:0%
process
 
04:12:29.030 --> 04:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's a huge inconvenience
 
04:12:32.090 --> 04:12:32.100 align:start position:0%
to people with a temporary dock to
 
04:12:35.150 --> 04:12:35.160 align:start position:0%
postpone their work or to relocate it
 
04:12:38.090 --> 04:12:38.100 align:start position:0%
and we are talking about one doc on a
 
04:12:40.130 --> 04:12:40.140 align:start position:0%
small Lake and maybe many docks on a
 
04:12:43.309 --> 04:12:43.319 align:start position:0%
very big lake but in most of these areas
 
04:12:45.110 --> 04:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
there's a Loon Lake there's only a
 
04:12:46.910 --> 04:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
couple of pairs at the most and we
 
04:12:49.429 --> 04:12:49.439 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to discourage that and so
 
04:12:51.469 --> 04:12:51.479 align:start position:0%
I wrap up my testimony with that thank
 
04:12:54.610 --> 04:12:54.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:57.170 --> 04:12:57.180 align:start position:0%
representative Donnelly or
 
04:12:59.870 --> 04:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
coming thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:13:01.910 --> 04:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
representative Vale for your uh
 
04:13:01.920 --> 04:13:03.590 align:start position:0%
representative Vale for your uh
information

04:13:03.590 --> 04:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
information
 
04:13:06.469 --> 04:13:06.479 align:start position:0%
um I'm very uh close to our loons we had
 
04:13:09.710 --> 04:13:09.720 align:start position:0%
a loon on our uh Canobie Lake we named
 
04:13:11.210 --> 04:13:11.220 align:start position:0%
him champ we've had him for we had him
 
04:13:13.070 --> 04:13:13.080 align:start position:0%
for 20 years
 
04:13:15.889 --> 04:13:15.899 align:start position:0%
um so we specifically have been working
 
04:13:17.630 --> 04:13:17.640 align:start position:0%
with the Loon preservation committee uh
 
04:13:18.769 --> 04:13:18.779 align:start position:0%
as the Canopy Lake protective
 
04:13:20.389 --> 04:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
Association and I'm the president of
 
04:13:22.550 --> 04:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
that Association for many many years and
 
04:13:25.250 --> 04:13:25.260 align:start position:0%
so yes I have a great deal of love for
 
04:13:28.610 --> 04:13:28.620 align:start position:0%
the loons absolutely champ had passed
 
04:13:32.750 --> 04:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
this past year because of the and they
 
04:13:34.610 --> 04:13:34.620 align:start position:0%
did actually nest and they they produced
 
04:13:36.650 --> 04:13:36.660 align:start position:0%
two eggs and then they abandoned the
 
04:13:39.050 --> 04:13:39.060 align:start position:0%
nest because a bald eagle actually
 
04:13:42.290 --> 04:13:42.300 align:start position:0%
attacked them so loons are very
 
04:13:44.210 --> 04:13:44.220 align:start position:0%
interesting I mean I'll be honest I mean
 
04:13:47.389 --> 04:13:47.399 align:start position:0%
I'm on the lake they're not scared of
 
04:13:49.070 --> 04:13:49.080 align:start position:0%
people they're not scared of boats on
 
04:13:50.630 --> 04:13:50.640 align:start position:0%
Canopy Lake you literally can drive
 
04:13:53.389 --> 04:13:53.399 align:start position:0%
around they'll come up right next to you
 
04:13:56.630 --> 04:13:56.640 align:start position:0%
depends on the lake so one of my uh you
 
04:13:58.370 --> 04:13:58.380 align:start position:0%
know cautionary tales with this with
 
04:14:00.050 --> 04:14:00.060 align:start position:0%
Amendment specifically it talks about
 
04:14:03.410 --> 04:14:03.420 align:start position:0%
150 feet for small lakes you're now
 
04:14:06.710 --> 04:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
affecting I don't know how many homes
 
04:14:09.050 --> 04:14:09.060 align:start position:0%
that suddenly won't be able to put their
 
04:14:11.269 --> 04:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
dock in because there may be a loon Nest
 
04:14:14.150 --> 04:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
that's near that particular area
 
04:14:17.090 --> 04:14:17.100 align:start position:0%
maybe 50 feet but this is way too
 
04:14:19.670 --> 04:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
extensive of of a territory that that's
 
04:14:21.469 --> 04:14:21.479 align:start position:0%
been randomly picked I don't know if
 
04:14:22.969 --> 04:14:22.979 align:start position:0%
there's any studies that talk about why
 
04:14:25.550 --> 04:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
150 that I'm aware of balloon
 
04:14:28.790 --> 04:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
preservation I recently supported
 
04:14:31.729 --> 04:14:31.739 align:start position:0%
um and we supported two rant I am two
 
04:14:33.889 --> 04:14:33.899 align:start position:0%
rafts that were put in one was next to
 
04:14:35.630 --> 04:14:35.640 align:start position:0%
my home which would which is closer than
 
04:14:37.969 --> 04:14:37.979 align:start position:0%
150 feet and if they were saying hey
 
04:14:40.010 --> 04:14:40.020 align:start position:0%
this would be a problem for you to keep
 
04:14:41.750 --> 04:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
your Dock and your boat here Tanya
 
04:14:43.910 --> 04:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
you're going to need to move this I
 
04:14:46.130 --> 04:14:46.140 align:start position:0%
probably would have relocated that Nest
 
04:14:47.870 --> 04:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
to another spot but this is a very nice
 
04:14:50.510 --> 04:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
secluded area it works well they
 
04:14:52.910 --> 04:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
frequently come unfortunately a mallard
 
04:14:56.330 --> 04:14:56.340 align:start position:0%
took over last year that particular nest
 
04:14:58.550 --> 04:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
so as far as a lot of the testimony you
 
04:15:01.849 --> 04:15:01.859 align:start position:0%
shared I I agree wounds are are are we
 
04:15:04.130 --> 04:15:04.140 align:start position:0%
all love them we want to keep them
 
04:15:06.650 --> 04:15:06.660 align:start position:0%
um however we need to understand this
 
04:15:09.650 --> 04:15:09.660 align:start position:0%
particular Amendment could impact a
 
04:15:12.590 --> 04:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
great deal of people's property that we
 
04:15:14.450 --> 04:15:14.460 align:start position:0%
have no idea what we're impacting by
 
04:15:16.849 --> 04:15:16.859 align:start position:0%
just passing this
 
04:15:18.170 --> 04:15:18.180 align:start position:0%
um and saying yes this is what we're
 
04:15:20.090 --> 04:15:20.100 align:start position:0%
going to do we could be affecting some
 
04:15:22.729 --> 04:15:22.739 align:start position:0%
tourist territory we could be I mean uh
 
04:15:25.670 --> 04:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
homes and other areas of of information
 
04:15:28.070 --> 04:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
so we need to be careful about this
 
04:15:29.809 --> 04:15:29.819 align:start position:0%
amendment because it's way too
 
04:15:32.929 --> 04:15:32.939 align:start position:0%
restrictive in in Feats and time um an
 
04:15:40.729 --> 04:15:40.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:46.870 --> 04:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:49.429 --> 04:15:49.439 align:start position:0%
just said I too will be voting against
 
04:15:52.309 --> 04:15:52.319 align:start position:0%
the motion out to pass as amended um I
 
04:15:53.689 --> 04:15:53.699 align:start position:0%
think that this committee should retain
 
04:15:55.130 --> 04:15:55.140 align:start position:0%
the bill I think that there's obviously
 
04:15:55.140 --> 04:15:56.150 align:start position:0%
the bill I think that there's obviously
some

04:15:56.150 --> 04:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
some
 
04:15:58.070 --> 04:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
um we could use some more insight from
 
04:15:59.330 --> 04:15:59.340 align:start position:0%
fish and game
 
04:16:01.010 --> 04:16:01.020 align:start position:0%
um I I am concerned with some of the
 
04:16:02.929 --> 04:16:02.939 align:start position:0%
language in the amendment
 
04:16:04.250 --> 04:16:04.260 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if it has a time limit
 
04:16:05.630 --> 04:16:05.640 align:start position:0%
on the nesting
 
04:16:08.030 --> 04:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
um we talked about how nests move
 
04:16:10.070 --> 04:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
um and so the idea that if it's a
 
04:16:11.689 --> 04:16:11.699 align:start position:0%
nesting area one year is it protected
 
04:16:12.889 --> 04:16:12.899 align:start position:0%
the following year because it was used
 
04:16:14.689 --> 04:16:14.699 align:start position:0%
as a previous Nest I think is something
 
04:16:16.790 --> 04:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
that the committee should explore and
 
04:16:18.110 --> 04:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
hope you come out with something that
 
04:16:21.889 --> 04:16:21.899 align:start position:0%
that does protect the uh balloons
 
04:16:25.790 --> 04:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:32.330 --> 04:16:32.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:34.969 --> 04:16:34.979 align:start position:0%
or of course he's the maker of the
 
04:16:34.979 --> 04:16:36.349 align:start position:0%
or of course he's the maker of the
motion

04:16:36.349 --> 04:16:36.359 align:start position:0%
motion
 
04:16:38.330 --> 04:16:38.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thanks for
 
04:16:39.410 --> 04:16:39.420 align:start position:0%
bringing the amendment it definitely
 
04:16:41.929 --> 04:16:41.939 align:start position:0%
makes it a better Bill narrowing it down
 
04:16:43.130 --> 04:16:43.140 align:start position:0%
to loons
 
04:16:44.750 --> 04:16:44.760 align:start position:0%
so I've heard from a number of
 
04:16:47.210 --> 04:16:47.220 align:start position:0%
landowners one is one of my best friends
 
04:16:49.550 --> 04:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
and mentors throughout my career who's
 
04:16:52.189 --> 04:16:52.199 align:start position:0%
retired up to Madison to Silver Lake and
 
04:16:55.150 --> 04:16:55.160 align:start position:0%
and built a home on his family property
 
04:16:58.250 --> 04:16:58.260 align:start position:0%
and he's introduced me to the lovely
 
04:17:00.530 --> 04:17:00.540 align:start position:0%
loons there and sent me pictures every
 
04:17:01.729 --> 04:17:01.739 align:start position:0%
time they nest
 
04:17:04.370 --> 04:17:04.380 align:start position:0%
and he has a um he's probably watching
 
04:17:07.490 --> 04:17:07.500 align:start position:0%
now he he has a temporary dock that he
 
04:17:09.469 --> 04:17:09.479 align:start position:0%
rolls in and out and he's very careful
 
04:17:11.990 --> 04:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
to put it nowhere near the loons but he
 
04:17:15.469 --> 04:17:15.479 align:start position:0%
doesn't have 150 feet so he'd be
 
04:17:17.090 --> 04:17:17.100 align:start position:0%
impacted and it's a small one of those
 
04:17:20.030 --> 04:17:20.040 align:start position:0%
docks with the the Rolling Wheels it's I
 
04:17:21.349 --> 04:17:21.359 align:start position:0%
mean it's no bigger than one of these
 
04:17:24.050 --> 04:17:24.060 align:start position:0%
little committee tables so he'd be
 
04:17:26.530 --> 04:17:26.540 align:start position:0%
impacted and he's the most
 
04:17:28.969 --> 04:17:28.979 align:start position:0%
conservation-minded family teaches his
 
04:17:30.889 --> 04:17:30.899 align:start position:0%
kids he's was brought up in it his Camp
 
04:17:34.189 --> 04:17:34.199 align:start position:0%
is over a hundred years old
 
04:17:37.969 --> 04:17:37.979 align:start position:0%
um so my concern is 150 feet and I'm all
 
04:17:39.769 --> 04:17:39.779 align:start position:0%
for protecting the loons and for the
 
04:17:41.570 --> 04:17:41.580 align:start position:0%
conservation and I'm glad the bill is
 
04:17:43.969 --> 04:17:43.979 align:start position:0%
narrowed from any endangered species or
 
04:17:45.349 --> 04:17:45.359 align:start position:0%
any threatened species that's the way it
 
04:17:47.450 --> 04:17:47.460 align:start position:0%
should be it has to be a balance between
 
04:17:49.490 --> 04:17:49.500 align:start position:0%
protecting the species
 
04:17:52.010 --> 04:17:52.020 align:start position:0%
and considering existing law and not
 
04:17:53.510 --> 04:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
passing laws for the sake of passing
 
04:17:53.520 --> 04:17:54.469 align:start position:0%
passing laws for the sake of passing
laws

04:17:54.469 --> 04:17:54.479 align:start position:0%
laws
 
04:17:56.570 --> 04:17:56.580 align:start position:0%
and letting our state departments do
 
04:17:58.130 --> 04:17:58.140 align:start position:0%
what they're empowered to do and
 
04:18:00.290 --> 04:18:00.300 align:start position:0%
protecting landowner rights so the
 
04:18:04.790 --> 04:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
question is how do we how do we do both
 
04:18:08.570 --> 04:18:08.580 align:start position:0%
and I'm and I'm not sure that 100 so 150
 
04:18:11.389 --> 04:18:11.399 align:start position:0%
feet is is a lot of places in Marine law
 
04:18:13.370 --> 04:18:13.380 align:start position:0%
you know 150 feet away from another
 
04:18:16.370 --> 04:18:16.380 align:start position:0%
Craft Jet Skis 150 feet away from
 
04:18:18.769 --> 04:18:18.779 align:start position:0%
Shoreline to prevent erosion that's
 
04:18:21.110 --> 04:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
where I think the 150 feet may have been
 
04:18:23.389 --> 04:18:23.399 align:start position:0%
plucked from because it's many places in
 
04:18:26.630 --> 04:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
Marine law and in and in lakes
 
04:18:28.849 --> 04:18:28.859 align:start position:0%
so I don't I don't know where the 150
 
04:18:31.370 --> 04:18:31.380 align:start position:0%
feet came from I'd be interested to know
 
04:18:35.030 --> 04:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
and I think passing something is
 
04:18:38.210 --> 04:18:38.220 align:start position:0%
probably not a bad idea
 
04:18:41.809 --> 04:18:41.819 align:start position:0%
so a work session or retaining maybe so
 
04:18:43.370 --> 04:18:43.380 align:start position:0%
I'm asking the question I'm throwing it
 
04:18:45.290 --> 04:18:45.300 align:start position:0%
out there so I'm not entirely against
 
04:18:48.229 --> 04:18:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:50.809 --> 04:18:50.819 align:start position:0%
but maybe not this exact thing so does
 
04:18:52.370 --> 04:18:52.380 align:start position:0%
somebody know where the 150 feet came
 
04:18:52.380 --> 04:18:53.870 align:start position:0%
somebody know where the 150 feet came
from

04:18:53.870 --> 04:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:18:56.030 --> 04:18:56.040 align:start position:0%
actually I think we probably have people
 
04:18:58.490 --> 04:18:58.500 align:start position:0%
who might then that is a legitimate
 
04:19:00.950 --> 04:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
question because 150 feet of Shoreline
 
04:19:05.510 --> 04:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
is a lot uh I mean that's not to make a
 
04:19:05.520 --> 04:19:07.150 align:start position:0%
is a lot uh I mean that's not to make a
uh

04:19:07.150 --> 04:19:07.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:19:11.030 --> 04:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
I did check well first of all before I
 
04:19:12.650 --> 04:19:12.660 align:start position:0%
ask you the question I did check with
 
04:19:12.660 --> 04:19:13.790 align:start position:0%
ask you the question I did check with
someone

04:19:13.790 --> 04:19:13.800 align:start position:0%
someone
 
04:19:16.450 --> 04:19:16.460 align:start position:0%
and and
 
04:19:21.410 --> 04:19:21.420 align:start position:0%
Des on this on where 150 feet comes from
 
04:19:23.630 --> 04:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
and they don't know
 
04:19:27.610 --> 04:19:27.620 align:start position:0%
okay is there yeah so you
 
04:19:31.969 --> 04:19:31.979 align:start position:0%
is what statue does have with those 150
 
04:19:34.309 --> 04:19:34.319 align:start position:0%
feet it's in many places I know in
 
04:19:36.530 --> 04:19:36.540 align:start position:0%
Marine law to stay away from the shore
 
04:19:39.110 --> 04:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
from another boat a lot of places that I
 
04:19:41.689 --> 04:19:41.699 align:start position:0%
know of but about from for this specific
 
04:19:43.729 --> 04:19:43.739 align:start position:0%
I don't know where that is but I
 
04:19:47.750 --> 04:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
couldn't find it in two one two a
 
04:19:51.229 --> 04:19:51.239 align:start position:0%
so where is the 150 or the for this one
 
04:19:54.830 --> 04:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
yeah it's not in RSA 212a
 
04:19:57.229 --> 04:19:57.239 align:start position:0%
um there's no distances there so I'm not
 
04:19:59.030 --> 04:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
I'm not exactly positive where it came
 
04:19:59.040 --> 04:20:02.809 align:start position:0%
I'm not exactly positive where it came
from

04:20:02.809 --> 04:20:02.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:05.929 --> 04:20:05.939 align:start position:0%
uh it did I spoke to representative
 
04:20:08.990 --> 04:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
Crawford about the narrowing it to the
 
04:20:10.250 --> 04:20:10.260 align:start position:0%
loans I knew immediately I live in
 
04:20:12.710 --> 04:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
moultonborough I'm in Loon Central I
 
04:20:16.010 --> 04:20:16.020 align:start position:0%
spend a lot of hours on the lake both
 
04:20:18.410 --> 04:20:18.420 align:start position:0%
paddling in on a power boat
 
04:20:20.990 --> 04:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
um so I guess I'm testifying but uh just
 
04:20:22.790 --> 04:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
to give you backstory I had talked to
 
04:20:24.590 --> 04:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
her about narrowing it to the loons this
 
04:20:26.990 --> 04:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
was an issue the commission had with it
 
04:20:29.330 --> 04:20:29.340 align:start position:0%
uh which is why we initially opposed it
 
04:20:31.729 --> 04:20:31.739 align:start position:0%
for the same reasons
 
04:20:34.010 --> 04:20:34.020 align:start position:0%
um and so I actually don't know where
 
04:20:37.010 --> 04:20:37.020 align:start position:0%
the 150 came from in her Amendment
 
04:20:39.790 --> 04:20:39.800 align:start position:0%
because she and I did not discuss
 
04:20:45.050 --> 04:20:45.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:47.210 --> 04:20:47.220 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I don't know where it came from
 
04:20:49.790 --> 04:20:49.800 align:start position:0%
either I representative Crawford just
 
04:20:52.490 --> 04:20:52.500 align:start position:0%
sent me the amendment but I
 
04:20:54.290 --> 04:20:54.300 align:start position:0%
um from the discussion in the sense I'm
 
04:20:56.689 --> 04:20:56.699 align:start position:0%
getting I would be happy to withdraw my
 
04:20:59.750 --> 04:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
motion and have us pursue either a work
 
04:21:02.870 --> 04:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
session or retain the bill so that we
 
04:21:06.050 --> 04:21:06.060 align:start position:0%
can make sure that it is effective in
 
04:21:09.070 --> 04:21:09.080 align:start position:0%
protecting the loons while respecting
 
04:21:12.050 --> 04:21:12.060 align:start position:0%
Waterfront owners
 
04:21:15.530 --> 04:21:15.540 align:start position:0%
okay does anybody have a sense
 
04:21:15.540 --> 04:21:16.490 align:start position:0%
okay does anybody have a sense
um

04:21:16.490 --> 04:21:16.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:20.870 --> 04:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
like how much is enough and what what do
 
04:21:24.229 --> 04:21:24.239 align:start position:0%
people have Waterfront wise
 
04:21:28.370 --> 04:21:28.380 align:start position:0%
uh we I think well I guess 75 feet maybe
 
04:21:30.110 --> 04:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
the subject for a workshops it's 75 feet
 
04:21:32.150 --> 04:21:32.160 align:start position:0%
enough and do most people have
 
04:21:34.070 --> 04:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
100 feet of beach I don't I don't know
 
04:21:36.110 --> 04:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
maybe that's a work session discussion I
 
04:21:38.950 --> 04:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:41.809 --> 04:21:41.819 align:start position:0%

clarification on 150 feet and I know
 
04:21:49.250 --> 04:21:49.260 align:start position:0%

04:21:51.349 --> 04:21:51.359 align:start position:0%
ask the department if they have a
 
04:22:02.450 --> 04:22:02.460 align:start position:0%

retention would might be better we
 
04:22:24.650 --> 04:22:24.660 align:start position:0%

04:22:27.729 --> 04:22:27.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:46.849 --> 04:22:46.859 align:start position:0%
