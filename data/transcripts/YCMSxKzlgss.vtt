00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
plant will close hundreds of people
 
00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:46.840 align:start position:0%
could lose their jobs and New
 
00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's Forest products industry
 
00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
will be deal dealt a severe blow in what
 
00:22:54.909 --> 00:22:54.919 align:start position:0%
will then be known as an unforced error
 
00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:56.440 align:start position:0%
on the part of this
 
00:22:59.110 --> 00:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
legislature to Reg the governor's veto
 
00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:01.400 align:start position:0%
message you would think we were dealing
 
00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:04.240 align:start position:0%
with a business that no one would miss
 
00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
one that was poorly
 
00:23:09.149 --> 00:23:09.159 align:start position:0%
run one that cost us more than it was
 
00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
worth knowing the plant as I do I still
 
00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
cannot understand the impetus for this
 
00:23:16.909 --> 00:23:16.919 align:start position:0%
wrong-headed thinking it could not be
 
00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:18.440 align:start position:0%
further from the
 
00:23:20.789 --> 00:23:20.799 align:start position:0%
truth the governor says New Hampshire
 
00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:23.200 align:start position:0%
rate payers have been taken for over
 
00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:25.640 align:start position:0%
$200 million in subsidies for the
 
00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:28.520 align:start position:0%
Burgess biomass plant
 
00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:32.120 align:start position:0%
the fact is that burge's biopower power
 
00:23:33.789 --> 00:23:33.799 align:start position:0%
purchase agreement with
 
00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
eversource specifies what each megawatt
 
00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:40.360 align:start position:0%
hour of power is worth and that is all
 
00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:42.320 align:start position:0%
they have received in their 10 years
 
00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
under this
 
00:23:45.669 --> 00:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
agreement the New Hampshire Department
 
00:23:48.269 --> 00:23:48.279 align:start position:0%
of energy completed an audit of Burgess
 
00:23:51.909 --> 00:23:51.919 align:start position:0%
last year after we passed SB
 
00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:55.320 align:start position:0%
271 in which they confirmed in which
 
00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:57.240 align:start position:0%
they confirmed that no money beyond what
 
00:23:58.750 --> 00:23:58.760 align:start position:0%
is allowed in the power purchase
 
00:24:01.669 --> 00:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
agreement was paid to burges by rate
 
00:24:04.909 --> 00:24:04.919 align:start position:0%
payers note however that biomass is a
 
00:24:07.909 --> 00:24:07.919 align:start position:0%
renewable energy source so Burgess is
 
00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:10.240 align:start position:0%
eligible for renewable energy credits
 
00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
which are turned over to eversource per
 
00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:14.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
law and renewable energy credits do not
 
00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
count as
 
00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
subsidies the governor goes on to say
 
00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
the power purchase agreement is an an
 
00:24:28.669 --> 00:24:28.679 align:start position:0%
example of what can go wrong in the bi
 
00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
when what can go wrong when government
 
00:24:32.789 --> 00:24:32.799 align:start position:0%
is exploited by opportunists in the
 
00:24:35.789 --> 00:24:35.799 align:start position:0%
private sector the governor is asking us
 
00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
to blame an award-winning
 
00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
state-of-the-art power plant who came to
 
00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:42.760 align:start position:0%
us for help in which both the House and
 
00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:45.480 align:start position:0%
Senate agreed that such help was
 
00:24:48.029 --> 00:24:48.039 align:start position:0%
appropriate indeed
 
00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:50.840 align:start position:0%
necessary in this case the problem with
 
00:24:53.389 --> 00:24:53.399 align:start position:0%
the power purchase agreement came from
 
00:24:55.269 --> 00:24:55.279 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Public Utilities
 
00:24:58.310 --> 00:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
Commission not the private sector New
 
00:25:00.389 --> 00:25:00.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Public Utilities Commission
 
00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
imposed a condition on the deal that
 
00:25:05.909 --> 00:25:05.919 align:start position:0%
forced burges to carry the difference
 
00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:09.200 align:start position:0%
between any lower price in the day ahead
 
00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
energy market and the agreed upon
 
00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
contract price in the power purchase
 
00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:17.240 align:start position:0%
agreement as an obligation on the
 
00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:20.440 align:start position:0%
company's books this imposition of a
 
00:25:23.389 --> 00:25:23.399 align:start position:0%
paper debt burden to the plant's cost
 
00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:26.440 align:start position:0%
structure changed the deal
 
00:25:29.269 --> 00:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
marketly this paper debt is not an
 
00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
operating cost of the
 
00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
plan but a calculation that is carried
 
00:25:37.149 --> 00:25:37.159 align:start position:0%
on the books but with an obligation to
 
00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:39.640 align:start position:0%
pay if the amount exceeds a fixed
 
00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
cap HB 142 as written and approved by us
 
00:25:48.789 --> 00:25:48.799 align:start position:0%
this spring excuses the acred excess
 
00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
amount the paper debt that Burg's
 
00:25:56.669 --> 00:25:56.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:56.679 --> 00:25:58.310 align:start position:0%
 
pay

00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
pay
 
00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
the governor goes on to blame Burgess
 
00:26:03.149 --> 00:26:03.159 align:start position:0%
biopower for taking too long to find a
 
00:26:03.159 --> 00:26:04.310 align:start position:0%
biopower for taking too long to find a
long-term

00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
long-term
 
00:26:06.549 --> 00:26:06.559 align:start position:0%
solution but the long time that's
 
00:26:10.389 --> 00:26:10.399 align:start position:0%
elapsed has been mostly on us Burgess
 
00:26:13.909 --> 00:26:13.919 align:start position:0%
first came to us in 2017 when we passed
 
00:26:13.919 --> 00:26:15.830 align:start position:0%
first came to us in 2017 when we passed
SB

00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
SB
 
00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
577 Burgess could see that the
 
00:26:20.149 --> 00:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
accumulating obligation on their books
 
00:26:22.789 --> 00:26:22.799 align:start position:0%
was a compounding problem that they
 
00:26:25.269 --> 00:26:25.279 align:start position:0%
could not fix that they could not fix it
 
00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:27.640 align:start position:0%
without renegotiating the contract or OB
 
00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
aining a waiver of the power purchase
 
00:26:31.909 --> 00:26:31.919 align:start position:0%
agreement from lawmakers to eliminate
 
00:26:33.149 --> 00:26:33.159 align:start position:0%
the paper
 
00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:36.360 align:start position:0%
debt there is no truth to any rumor that
 
00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:38.600 align:start position:0%
the debt is a result of how the plant is
 
00:26:41.549 --> 00:26:41.559 align:start position:0%
run or that it has not operated to its
 
00:26:41.559 --> 00:26:42.630 align:start position:0%
run or that it has not operated to its
fullest

00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:42.640 align:start position:0%
fullest
 
00:26:45.310 --> 00:26:45.320 align:start position:0%
capability to date ever Source has not
 
00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
been willing to come back to the table
 
00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:49.480 align:start position:0%
to negotiate any change of the power
 
00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:51.029 align:start position:0%
to negotiate any change of the power
purchase

00:26:51.029 --> 00:26:51.039 align:start position:0%
purchase
 
00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:53.720 align:start position:0%
agreement whether Burgess continues in
 
00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:55.960 align:start position:0%
operation with all of the benefits of
 
00:26:59.310 --> 00:26:59.320 align:start position:0%
locally sourced renewable electric power
 
00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:01.000 align:start position:0%
and the jobs that it brings to the New
 
00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:04.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire economy now Falls to us here
 
00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
today to the
 
00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
decide in 2018 we suspended the paper
 
00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:12.360 align:start position:0%
debt for three years to provide time to
 
00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:15.200 align:start position:0%
find a way forward and we should we
 
00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
should have provided relief from the
 
00:27:20.549 --> 00:27:20.559 align:start position:0%
accumulating obligation then but we did
 
00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
not so in 2021 we passed s SP
 
00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
271 uh to to forgive the accumulated
 
00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:30.440 align:start position:0%
paper debt altogether but a house
 
00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:33.200 align:start position:0%
Amendment modified that bill and delayed
 
00:27:35.909 --> 00:27:35.919 align:start position:0%
forgiveness again until the New
 
00:27:37.669 --> 00:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of energy could
 
00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:40.360 align:start position:0%
complete an audit of burgess's
 
00:27:42.389 --> 00:27:42.399 align:start position:0%
books the
 
00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
results the results of the audit were
 
00:27:46.669 --> 00:27:46.679 align:start position:0%
received in December
 
00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
2022 and they concluded that the plant's
 
00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:51.960 align:start position:0%
finances were in fact as presented by
 
00:27:54.029 --> 00:27:54.039 align:start position:0%
Burgess and that the plant has been
 
00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:56.200 align:start position:0%
operated to the highest professional
 
00:27:58.909 --> 00:27:58.919 align:start position:0%
industry standards
 
00:28:02.710 --> 00:28:02.720 align:start position:0%
with these results in hand HB 142 was
 
00:28:05.149 --> 00:28:05.159 align:start position:0%
filed to finally give the plant the
 
00:28:08.269 --> 00:28:08.279 align:start position:0%
solution it had originally sought we
 
00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
voted 269 to 109 in favor of that relief
 
00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
this past spring and the Senate vote
 
00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
that followed was unanimous declaring
 
00:28:19.269 --> 00:28:19.279 align:start position:0%
that passing this bill was the right
 
00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:21.440 align:start position:0%
thing for New
 
00:28:24.190 --> 00:28:24.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire then came the V veto which
 
00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:26.440 align:start position:0%
brings us to where we are
 
00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:30.360 align:start position:0%
today I'll cut my remarks short here to
 
00:28:34.509 --> 00:28:34.519 align:start position:0%
allow my uh fellow colleague from fellow
 
00:28:36.389 --> 00:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
representative from burin
 
00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
to carry on but let me make one more
 
00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:42.440 align:start position:0%
comment before I step away from the
 
00:28:45.789 --> 00:28:45.799 align:start position:0%
well burges biopower is good for the
 
00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
economy Burg's bi biopower is good for
 
00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:52.120 align:start position:0%
Berlin and the North country and Burgess
 
00:28:56.389 --> 00:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
biopower is good for New Hampshire thank
 
00:28:56.399 --> 00:28:59.350 align:start position:0%
biopower is good for New Hampshire thank
you

00:28:59.350 --> 00:28:59.360 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes Edmund ke
 
00:29:12.029 --> 00:29:12.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:15.149 --> 00:29:15.159 align:start position:0%
Kelly thank you Mr
 
00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
Speaker as my colleague alluded to in
 
00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
the governor's veto message he blames
 
00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
Burgess biopower for f taking too long
 
00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:24.440 align:start position:0%
to find a long-term solution but finding
 
00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:25.960 align:start position:0%
a solution has always been the
 
00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:28.480 align:start position:0%
responsibility of this leg legislature
 
00:29:30.669 --> 00:29:30.679 align:start position:0%
the reason it may seem that we have been
 
00:29:32.549 --> 00:29:32.559 align:start position:0%
asked to vote on this so many times is
 
00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:34.760 align:start position:0%
because we the legislature have
 
00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
continued to Kick the Can down the road
 
00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:40.360 align:start position:0%
each time we have voted for a suspension
 
00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:43.880 align:start position:0%
it has delayed repayment but not AC
 
00:29:45.669 --> 00:29:45.679 align:start position:0%
cruel of the
 
00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:48.120 align:start position:0%
CRF last year when this legislature
 
00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
voted to suspend the repayment for a
 
00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:51.480 align:start position:0%
fifth year we did so with the
 
00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
understanding that it would give the
 
00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:54.760 align:start position:0%
department of energy time to complete a
 
00:29:57.509 --> 00:29:57.519 align:start position:0%
full Financial audit of this facility
 
00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
the agreement was that once we had that
 
00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
audit in hand we would return with that
 
00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:05.480 align:start position:0%
long-term solution the audit which was
 
00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:07.640 align:start position:0%
exhaustive confirmed that the biomass
 
00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:09.880 align:start position:0%
plant is one of the best in the country
 
00:30:11.789 --> 00:30:11.799 align:start position:0%
and now we are back to give the governor
 
00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
the long-term solution he has been
 
00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:16.360 align:start position:0%
asking for as this bill was so expertly
 
00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:17.720 align:start position:0%
amended by the chair of the house
 
00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:19.640 align:start position:0%
science technology and energy committee
 
00:30:22.389 --> 00:30:22.399 align:start position:0%
it only resets the Clock IT returns us
 
00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
to that $100 million cap on the CRF and
 
00:30:27.310 --> 00:30:27.320 align:start position:0%
puts the responsibility squarely on
 
00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:31.240 align:start position:0%
Burgess for any F future acrs today we
 
00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
vote on whether Burgess will continue to
 
00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
operate November 1st when the current
 
00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
suspension expires a lot has been made
 
00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:40.360 align:start position:0%
about the benefit of the plant to the
 
00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
forest Product Industry but the benefits
 
00:30:45.909 --> 00:30:45.919 align:start position:0%
extend to every corner of this state the
 
00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
mom and pop gas stations who provide
 
00:30:50.389 --> 00:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
Fuel and food to the 100 plus truckers
 
00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
Who deliver chips to the plant every day
 
00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
the Family Farms in all 10 counties of
 
00:30:57.990 --> 00:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
this state who receive low priced
 
00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
fertilizer made from the nutrient Rich
 
00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:03.240 align:start position:0%
fly ash that it comes exclusively from
 
00:31:05.509 --> 00:31:05.519 align:start position:0%
this plant The Machinist the
 
00:31:07.669 --> 00:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
electricians the pipe fitters none of
 
00:31:09.669 --> 00:31:09.679 align:start position:0%
whom are directly employed by Burgess
 
00:31:11.909 --> 00:31:11.919 align:start position:0%
but can rely on the plant for regular
 
00:31:15.149 --> 00:31:15.159 align:start position:0%
business let there be no mistake if we
 
00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
do not vote to override The veto today
 
00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
the result will be devastating for all
 
00:31:22.509 --> 00:31:22.519 align:start position:0%
of Coos County and others across this
 
00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
entire State please join me in voting
 
00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:29.480 align:start position:0%
yay to overturn this veto thank you J
 
00:31:36.549 --> 00:31:36.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:39.509 --> 00:31:39.519 align:start position:0%
Harrington thank you Mr Speaker uh this
 
00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
is kind of like deja vu all over again
 
00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
here we are back again with the third
 
00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
and a never-ending series of bailout
 
00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:47.360 align:start position:0%
bills for the Burgess biomass plant no
 
00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
one's going to stand here and say it's
 
00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
not a well-run efficient plant a
 
00:31:53.029 --> 00:31:53.039 align:start position:0%
well-run plant it's not very efficient
 
00:31:54.389 --> 00:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
because the thermal efficiency of the
 
00:31:57.190 --> 00:31:57.200 align:start position:0%
plant is about 18% less than half of an
 
00:31:59.789 --> 00:31:59.799 align:start position:0%
oil or coal or nuclear plant less than a
 
00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:02.320 align:start position:0%
third of a combined cycle gas plant it's
 
00:32:04.509 --> 00:32:04.519 align:start position:0%
just is not an efficient way to make
 
00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
electricity but let's go back in history
 
00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:08.200 align:start position:0%
just a little bit to see what happened
 
00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:10.120 align:start position:0%
and how we got here the plant was
 
00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
proposed back in the uh 2010 2012 region
 
00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
and it had to go in front of the site
 
00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee to get a permit I
 
00:32:20.669 --> 00:32:20.679 align:start position:0%
was on that committee at the time now
 
00:32:22.389 --> 00:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
they one of the things obviously a plant
 
00:32:24.909 --> 00:32:24.919 align:start position:0%
like this has to do is raise Capital now
 
00:32:27.669 --> 00:32:27.679 align:start position:0%
because of the uh federal laws uh and
 
00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:29.960 align:start position:0%
under the Biden Administration Burgess
 
00:32:31.549 --> 00:32:31.559 align:start position:0%
was able to get the production tax
 
00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:33.200 align:start position:0%
credits paid UPF front they were able to
 
00:32:34.909 --> 00:32:34.919 align:start position:0%
roll those up and get paid in advance
 
00:32:37.149 --> 00:32:37.159 align:start position:0%
and use it towards Capital cost and they
 
00:32:38.549 --> 00:32:38.559 align:start position:0%
also were eligible for what's called a
 
00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:41.080 align:start position:0%
new market tax credit these amounted to
 
00:32:42.590 --> 00:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
tens of millions of dollars from the
 
00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:44.320 align:start position:0%
taxpayers that went to Burgess in the
 
00:32:46.669 --> 00:32:46.679 align:start position:0%
form of of those breaks but that still
 
00:32:49.149 --> 00:32:49.159 align:start position:0%
was not enough because there a these
 
00:32:51.149 --> 00:32:51.159 align:start position:0%
plants are very expensive to build so
 
00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
they had to get a purchase power
 
00:32:54.789 --> 00:32:54.799 align:start position:0%
agreement without that they could not
 
00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
get the capital to build their plant
 
00:32:59.590 --> 00:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
they pursued actively pursued the
 
00:33:01.549 --> 00:33:01.559 align:start position:0%
purchase power agreement with eversource
 
00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
and they came to an agreement with
 
00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
eversource this agreement went to the Pu
 
00:33:08.110 --> 00:33:08.120 align:start position:0%
the Pu then modified it to put in what I
 
00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:10.200 align:start position:0%
refer to as a safety valve basically it
 
00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:12.720 align:start position:0%
said we'll we can pay you the terms of
 
00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:15.240 align:start position:0%
the contract but if the amount being
 
00:33:18.430 --> 00:33:18.440 align:start position:0%
paid continues to go over market rate to
 
00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
the point where it comes over $100
 
00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
million that the rate payers subsidize
 
00:33:25.269 --> 00:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
Burgess for then Burgess will have to
 
00:33:27.029 --> 00:33:27.039 align:start position:0%
start paying back the money that's
 
00:33:29.269 --> 00:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
simply where we're at we've passed two
 
00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
bailout bills in the past to put that
 
00:33:32.789 --> 00:33:32.799 align:start position:0%
off we keep delaying it like they said
 
00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
Kick the Can down the road and now they
 
00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
want to change the contract
 
00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
completely it's simple live up to the
 
00:33:41.909 --> 00:33:41.919 align:start position:0%
contract that you signed no one forced
 
00:33:43.950 --> 00:33:43.960 align:start position:0%
them to sign the contract if you sign a
 
00:33:46.909 --> 00:33:46.919 align:start position:0%
contract for buying a house because you
 
00:33:48.389 --> 00:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
think the value of the house is going to
 
00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
go up over a period of time you take out
 
00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
a loan and the value doesn't go up you
 
00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
just can't go back to the bank and say
 
00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
well you know I'm going only to make
 
00:33:57.549 --> 00:33:57.559 align:start position:0%
half my mortgage pay payments because
 
00:33:59.269 --> 00:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
the house didn't go up in value like I
 
00:34:01.509 --> 00:34:01.519 align:start position:0%
expected it was and that's what they're
 
00:34:03.549 --> 00:34:03.559 align:start position:0%
trying to do here another
 
00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:05.440 align:start position:0%
misrepresentation that's often given is
 
00:34:07.389 --> 00:34:07.399 align:start position:0%
somehow this is so important to the
 
00:34:10.069 --> 00:34:10.079 align:start position:0%
electric grid in New Hampshire Burgess
 
00:34:14.109 --> 00:34:14.119 align:start position:0%
accounts for about 0 2% of the capacity
 
00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:17.919 align:start position:0%
in New England that's. 2% it's about 75
 
00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:20.560 align:start position:0%
megawatt to put that in perspective with
 
00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
of what's going on in the region next
 
00:34:25.230 --> 00:34:25.240 align:start position:0%
spring ISO New England is going to allow
 
00:34:28.270 --> 00:34:28.280 align:start position:0%
1,400 megawatts at the Mystic facility
 
00:34:29.869 --> 00:34:29.879 align:start position:0%
to go out permanently they're going to
 
00:34:32.069 --> 00:34:32.079 align:start position:0%
go away permanently it's 1400 megawatts
 
00:34:32.079 --> 00:34:33.149 align:start position:0%
go away permanently it's 1400 megawatts
versus

00:34:33.149 --> 00:34:33.159 align:start position:0%
versus
 
00:34:36.869 --> 00:34:36.879 align:start position:0%
75 so you look around and say who's
 
00:34:38.990 --> 00:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
supporting this and who isn't well I can
 
00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:40.280 align:start position:0%
tell you the business industry
 
00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
Association is opposed to it the
 
00:34:44.069 --> 00:34:44.079 align:start position:0%
environmental groups I believe with the
 
00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:45.560 align:start position:0%
Siara Club as one of them is not
 
00:34:48.430 --> 00:34:48.440 align:start position:0%
supporting it Don Cree the consumer
 
00:34:49.950 --> 00:34:49.960 align:start position:0%
advocate of the State of New Hampshire
 
00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:52.200 align:start position:0%
is not supporting it they all want the
 
00:34:53.589 --> 00:34:53.599 align:start position:0%
veto to be
 
00:34:56.190 --> 00:34:56.200 align:start position:0%
upheld so let's just look at what's
 
00:34:58.349 --> 00:34:58.359 align:start position:0%
going on right now now right now
 
00:35:00.069 --> 00:35:00.079 align:start position:0%
assuming that they run the bio purchas
 
00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:02.280 align:start position:0%
bio plan is running they're going to get
 
00:35:05.109 --> 00:35:05.119 align:start position:0%
paid rate payer subsidies of about
 
00:35:08.349 --> 00:35:08.359 align:start position:0%
$44,000 an hour as we sit here so just
 
00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:09.680 align:start position:0%
put that up we're here for a couple of
 
00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:12.880 align:start position:0%
hours that's $8,000 in two hours that's
 
00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:15.960 align:start position:0%
because the way the contract works every
 
00:35:18.589 --> 00:35:18.599 align:start position:0%
source is required to pay them in the
 
00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
range of $90 a megawatt hour for every
 
00:35:23.069 --> 00:35:23.079 align:start position:0%
megawatt they produce and then ever so
 
00:35:25.589 --> 00:35:25.599 align:start position:0%
immediately sells that power into the U
 
00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
daily markets but the daily market price
 
00:35:31.109 --> 00:35:31.119 align:start position:0%
right now is about $30 so the difference
 
00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
is made up by that rate payer subsidy
 
00:35:35.230 --> 00:35:35.240 align:start position:0%
when the cap that was in the contract
 
00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
that they agreed to and signed was
 
00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:39.440 align:start position:0%
reached which was the $100 million they
 
00:35:41.349 --> 00:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
were supposed to start paying that back
 
00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:43.320 align:start position:0%
and now they want to say no we want to
 
00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
forget forgive that we don't want to
 
00:35:48.829 --> 00:35:48.839 align:start position:0%
have to pay it back but we'll go back to
 
00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
the terms of the contract once you wipe
 
00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:52.720 align:start position:0%
out our debt and it'll continue to build
 
00:35:54.589 --> 00:35:54.599 align:start position:0%
up but you know what's going to happen
 
00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
next year two years from now three years
 
00:35:57.870 --> 00:35:57.880 align:start position:0%
from now they right back here again
 
00:35:58.910 --> 00:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
because they're still not going to be
 
00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:00.200 align:start position:0%
able to pay it back because they're
 
00:36:01.349 --> 00:36:01.359 align:start position:0%
still going to be getting massive
 
00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
subsidies it we're just running up the
 
00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
bill again this does nothing but delay
 
00:36:07.589 --> 00:36:07.599 align:start position:0%
the inevitable this this plant may be
 
00:36:09.349 --> 00:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
well-run and everything else but it's
 
00:36:10.750 --> 00:36:10.760 align:start position:0%
just not an efficient way to make
 
00:36:12.190 --> 00:36:12.200 align:start position:0%
electricity and they're going to
 
00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:13.720 align:start position:0%
continue to run up that bill and the
 
00:36:16.030 --> 00:36:16.040 align:start position:0%
rate payers are going to be responsible
 
00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:19.000 align:start position:0%
so nothing's going to change
 
00:36:21.790 --> 00:36:21.800 align:start position:0%
here they all we're doing is saying live
 
00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
up to the terms of the contract that you
 
00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:26.440 align:start position:0%
aggressively pursued and sign and
 
00:36:27.829 --> 00:36:27.839 align:start position:0%
another little fact that I think most
 
00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
people don't realize is that this is
 
00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
only eversource customers that are
 
00:36:33.349 --> 00:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
paying the subsidy if this plan is so
 
00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
wonderful and so important to the state
 
00:36:37.829 --> 00:36:37.839 align:start position:0%
then maybe should pass a tax would be a
 
00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:39.960 align:start position:0%
more Equitable way and have everybody in
 
00:36:41.829 --> 00:36:41.839 align:start position:0%
the state pay it but if you're a liberty
 
00:36:44.109 --> 00:36:44.119 align:start position:0%
unitel or Co-op customer even if you're
 
00:36:45.829 --> 00:36:45.839 align:start position:0%
a co-op customer who lives in the North
 
00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:48.040 align:start position:0%
Country who makes their living off of
 
00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
selling products to Berlin biomass you
 
00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
don't pay a diam in subsidies but a
 
00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:54.640 align:start position:0%
retired school teacher living in
 
00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
Manchester on a fixed income pays a
 
00:37:00.069 --> 00:37:00.079 align:start position:0%
higher electric bill to support this so
 
00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
I guess it comes down to this does you
 
00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
think the government should be picking
 
00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
winners and losers and decide which
 
00:37:07.630 --> 00:37:07.640 align:start position:0%
companies will be successful because of
 
00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:09.440 align:start position:0%
subsidies or do you think people should
 
00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
be free to make the choice of what type
 
00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:13.240 align:start position:0%
of electricity they want to buy please
 
00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:15.720 align:start position:0%
vote to uphold The
 
00:37:24.349 --> 00:37:24.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:27.720 align:start position:0%
cascaden thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:30.400 align:start position:0%
I have notes so I can give you the facts
 
00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:32.440 align:start position:0%
the Burgess biomass plant has produced
 
00:37:34.270 --> 00:37:34.280 align:start position:0%
power for New Hampshire consistently and
 
00:37:36.589 --> 00:37:36.599 align:start position:0%
reliably to the terms of the purchase
 
00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:39.240 align:start position:0%
power agreement to the ter uh for 10
 
00:37:42.349 --> 00:37:42.359 align:start position:0%
years now we midpoint during that 10year
 
00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:46.040 align:start position:0%
period Burgess has contributed
 
00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:47.750 align:start position:0%
period Burgess has contributed
$700

00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
$700
 
00:37:50.910 --> 00:37:50.920 align:start position:0%
million to New Hampshire's
 
00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:53.480 align:start position:0%
economy we made the right decision this
 
00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
winter when we overwhelmingly passed the
 
00:37:58.550 --> 00:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
142 there's been a lot of misinformation
 
00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:03.640 align:start position:0%
about the management of this plant
 
00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
recently yet there is no credible
 
00:38:08.109 --> 00:38:08.119 align:start position:0%
evidence that this is anything but a
 
00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
best-in-class management
 
00:38:14.589 --> 00:38:14.599 align:start position:0%
team Burgess achieves availability and
 
00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:17.880 align:start position:0%
credibility percentages of over
 
00:38:22.069 --> 00:38:22.079 align:start position:0%
90% when the industry average is
 
00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:25.000 align:start position:0%

00:38:27.069 --> 00:38:27.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's Forest products industry
 
00:38:30.190 --> 00:38:30.200 align:start position:0%

taxes in North Country communities
 
00:38:59.910 --> 00:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
particularly coos if we let this veto
 
00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:05.240 align:start position:0%
stand more facts true facts Burgess buys
 
00:39:09.390 --> 00:39:09.400 align:start position:0%

00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:19.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the facility uses onethird of
 
00:39:21.829 --> 00:39:21.839 align:start position:0%
all the wood cut in New Hampshire's
 
00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:25.720 align:start position:0%
1.4 billion dollars of forest products
 
00:39:28.510 --> 00:39:28.520 align:start position:0%
industry while providing steady
 
00:39:32.829 --> 00:39:32.839 align:start position:0%
well-paying jobs to 29 plant employees

and supporting 240 jobs
 
00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:39.720 align:start position:0%
Statewide so Burgess by itself injects
 
00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
nearly $70 million into New Hampshire's
 
00:39:47.829 --> 00:39:47.839 align:start position:0%
economy each year the economics of
 
00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
managing our Timberlands will be upended
 
00:39:53.550 --> 00:39:53.560 align:start position:0%
if we allow this plant to close we stand
 
00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
to lose these and many more economic
 
00:39:57.150 --> 00:39:57.160 align:start position:0%
benefits if we allow allow burges to
 
00:39:57.160 --> 00:39:58.349 align:start position:0%
benefits if we allow allow burges to
cease

00:39:58.349 --> 00:39:58.359 align:start position:0%
cease
 
00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
operating to lose our one remaining
 
00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
biomass plant particularly a plant that
 
00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
is among the top three top three most
 
00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:11.160 align:start position:0%
efficient and well-run biomass
 
00:40:13.470 --> 00:40:13.480 align:start position:0%
facilities in the
 
00:40:17.390 --> 00:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
country would be a real failure by this
 
00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
legislature that failure would be a
 
00:40:22.309 --> 00:40:22.319 align:start position:0%
caving into politics at a time our
 
00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
fellow citizens looked us for help with
 
00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:27.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's economy
 
00:40:30.270 --> 00:40:30.280 align:start position:0%
in hearings our constituents have asked
 
00:40:31.950 --> 00:40:31.960 align:start position:0%
us to save New Hampshire's Forest
 
00:40:34.349 --> 00:40:34.359 align:start position:0%
economy and also to help continue the
 
00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
city of Berlin's economic recovery from
 
00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:38.800 align:start position:0%

shutdown overturning this video is the
 
00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:42.430 align:start position:0%
shutdown overturning this video is the
right

00:40:42.430 --> 00:40:42.440 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:40:45.069 --> 00:40:45.079 align:start position:0%
decision to deliver economic benefits
 
00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
for the North country and for the entire
 
00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:51.440 align:start position:0%

industry my family owned a business that
 
00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
serviced the logging industry and I've
 
00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
been on the personal and professional
 
00:41:13.349 --> 00:41:13.359 align:start position:0%
downside of the city's declining
 
00:41:15.870 --> 00:41:15.880 align:start position:0%
economy when the legislature voted
 
00:41:19.829 --> 00:41:19.839 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly in favor of 142 this
 
00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:23.640 align:start position:0%
spring we got it right the reasons this
 
00:41:25.630 --> 00:41:25.640 align:start position:0%
bill passed originally are just as valid
 
00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:28.520 align:start position:0%
now as they were a few months ago let's
 
00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:31.400 align:start position:0%
show the people who elected us our
 
00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
Foresters our land owners our fellow
 
00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
citizens that we can do the right thing
 
00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire and overturn the
 
00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
governor's veto of House Bill
 
00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:51.960 align:start position:0%
you the state constitution requires a
 
00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
roll call or 2/3 vote is required to
 
00:41:55.990 --> 00:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
overwrite a veto this will be a roll
 
00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:25.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:55.150 align:start position:0%

00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr thank you Mr
 
00:43:18.430 --> 00:43:18.440 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr Speaker if I know that the
 
00:43:21.309 --> 00:43:21.319 align:start position:0%
Burgess biomass plant to date has
 
00:43:24.069 --> 00:43:24.079 align:start position:0%
already received over $200 million in
 
00:43:28.030 --> 00:43:28.040 align:start position:0%
bailouts and if I know the HB 142 is for
 
00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
all tents and purposes a bailout of
 
00:43:34.270 --> 00:43:34.280 align:start position:0%
upwards of 70 million or more and if I
 
00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
know that in two years a request for
 
00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:39.960 align:start position:0%
another 70 million plus bailout will be
 
00:43:43.230 --> 00:43:43.240 align:start position:0%
made and if I know $70
 
00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:46.480 align:start position:0%
million every two years is quite
 
00:43:49.109 --> 00:43:49.119 align:start position:0%
expensive for 30 plus
 
00:43:52.109 --> 00:43:52.119 align:start position:0%
employees and if I know that the states
 
00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
like Massachusetts and Massachusetts
 
00:43:58.870 --> 00:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
current law and environmental groups no
 
00:44:02.589 --> 00:44:02.599 align:start position:0%
longer view burning biomass as renewable
 
00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
energy and if I generally believe that
 
00:44:08.829 --> 00:44:08.839 align:start position:0%
just like Wall Street banks no one is
 
00:44:11.349 --> 00:44:11.359 align:start position:0%
too big or too small to
 
00:44:14.670 --> 00:44:14.680 align:start position:0%
fail then I would push the red button to
 
00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
concur with the governor's veto thank
 
00:44:18.750 --> 00:44:18.760 align:start position:0%
you Mr Speaker J I recognize
 
00:44:22.349 --> 00:44:22.359 align:start position:0%
representative McGee for parlamentary
 
00:44:24.790 --> 00:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr
 
00:44:27.589 --> 00:44:27.599 align:start position:0%
Speaker if if I know that letting this
 
00:44:31.790 --> 00:44:31.800 align:start position:0%
veto stand forces a huge unjustified tax
 
00:44:33.349 --> 00:44:33.359 align:start position:0%
increase on the people of the North
 
00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
country and brings job losses and
 
00:44:39.309 --> 00:44:39.319 align:start position:0%
uncertainty and if I know that this
 
00:44:42.910 --> 00:44:42.920 align:start position:0%
plant receives no other rate payer money
 
00:44:45.190 --> 00:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
than what appears in the signed contract
 
00:44:48.270 --> 00:44:48.280 align:start position:0%
it entered into into 2013 and that
 
00:44:50.829 --> 00:44:50.839 align:start position:0%
renewable energy credits do not count as
 
00:44:52.829 --> 00:44:52.839 align:start position:0%
subsidies because they belong to the

00:44:57.589 --> 00:44:57.599 align:start position:0%
not the the plant the
 
00:44:59.750 --> 00:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
producer and if I know that Burgess
 
00:45:03.430 --> 00:45:03.440 align:start position:0%

00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:05.160 align:start position:0%

Timberland economics chokes local
 
00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:12.040 align:start position:0%
economies shrinks our energy and
 
00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:14.280 align:start position:0%
dependence and leaves New Hampshire more
 
00:45:17.390 --> 00:45:17.400 align:start position:0%
vulnerable to forest fires and finally
 
00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
if I know the North country is saying
 
00:45:22.309 --> 00:45:22.319 align:start position:0%
enough is enough they came to us for
 
00:45:25.109 --> 00:45:25.119 align:start position:0%
help and we gave it to them by a veto
 
00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
proof vote
 
00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:29.200 align:start position:0%
and they are still counting on us to see
 
00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
it through their eyes then would I now

Maguire thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:48:28.990 --> 00:48:29.000 align:start position:0%
most of you probably don't remember
 
00:48:31.630 --> 00:48:31.640 align:start position:0%
House Bill 337 at
 
00:48:35.670 --> 00:48:35.680 align:start position:0%
all that's because when it went to
 
00:48:40.030 --> 00:48:40.040 align:start position:0%
Edna there was no opposition some
 
00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
concerns so we had several subcommittee
 
00:48:46.069 --> 00:48:46.079 align:start position:0%
meetings and amended the bill to fix
 
00:48:47.549 --> 00:48:47.559 align:start position:0%
some of the concerns that were brought
 
00:48:50.910 --> 00:48:50.920 align:start position:0%
to our attention it passed the house it
 
00:48:52.670 --> 00:48:52.680 align:start position:0%
passed the committee unanimously and it
 
00:48:54.349 --> 00:48:54.359 align:start position:0%
passed the house on
 
00:48:57.349 --> 00:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
consent it went to finance cuz there's a
 
00:49:01.109 --> 00:49:01.119 align:start position:0%
small cost involved in implementing
 
00:49:04.150 --> 00:49:04.160 align:start position:0%
it they reviewed it passed it
 
00:49:07.069 --> 00:49:07.079 align:start position:0%
unanimously in committee and it passed
 
00:49:09.589 --> 00:49:09.599 align:start position:0%
the house on a
 
00:49:15.910 --> 00:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
387 to0 roll call vote so House Bill 337
 
00:49:18.150 --> 00:49:18.160 align:start position:0%
is the house
 
00:49:22.430 --> 00:49:22.440 align:start position:0%
position in the Senate the office of
 
00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
professional liur and
 
00:49:27.990 --> 00:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
certification brought some additional
 
00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
concerns and worked with the Senate to
 
00:49:35.910 --> 00:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
put in language that settled their
 
00:49:38.910 --> 00:49:38.920 align:start position:0%
concerns it passed the Senate on a Voice
 
00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:41.109 align:start position:0%
concerns it passed the Senate on a Voice
vote

00:49:41.109 --> 00:49:41.119 align:start position:0%
vote
 
00:49:44.589 --> 00:49:44.599 align:start position:0%
twice we concurred with the Senate
 
00:49:47.950 --> 00:49:47.960 align:start position:0%
Amendment also on a Voice vote without
 
00:49:52.270 --> 00:49:52.280 align:start position:0%
debate so this is a not minor build not
 
00:49:53.589 --> 00:49:53.599 align:start position:0%
really very
 
00:49:55.789 --> 00:49:55.799 align:start position:0%
controversial what it does is it
 
00:50:00.829 --> 00:50:00.839 align:start position:0%
requires notice of meetings for
 
00:50:00.839 --> 00:50:02.069 align:start position:0%
requires notice of meetings for
licensing

00:50:02.069 --> 00:50:02.079 align:start position:0%
licensing
 
00:50:06.789 --> 00:50:06.799 align:start position:0%
boards and that the information that the
 
00:50:10.589 --> 00:50:10.599 align:start position:0%
board has be shared with the the
 
00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
audience we've all been in various
 
00:50:15.990 --> 00:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
boards or committee meetings where the
 
00:50:18.109 --> 00:50:18.119 align:start position:0%
committee has a piece of paper with an
 
00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
amendment or a schedule or a change and
 
00:50:23.630 --> 00:50:23.640 align:start position:0%
they're all looking at it and discussing
 
00:50:26.589 --> 00:50:26.599 align:start position:0%
it and a room full of people are staring
 
00:50:28.870 --> 00:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
at them because that information is not
 
00:50:31.630 --> 00:50:31.640 align:start position:0%
available to them there's nothing like
 
00:50:34.950 --> 00:50:34.960 align:start position:0%
getting a 35 page Amendment you know
 
00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
when you walk into the committee room
 
00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
you're not going to have a chance to
 
00:50:41.230 --> 00:50:41.240 align:start position:0%
review it
 
00:50:44.349 --> 00:50:44.359 align:start position:0%
so what this bill does is it enforces
 
00:50:47.190 --> 00:50:47.200 align:start position:0%
transparency for licensing
 
00:50:50.069 --> 00:50:50.079 align:start position:0%
boards the governor did have a very good
 
00:50:52.750 --> 00:50:52.760 align:start position:0%
point that it doesn't that it only
 
00:50:56.230 --> 00:50:56.240 align:start position:0%
applies specifically to licensing boards
 
00:50:58.589 --> 00:50:58.599 align:start position:0%
there's two reasons for that the first
 
00:51:02.710 --> 00:51:02.720 align:start position:0%
is that they have a long history
 
00:51:04.789 --> 00:51:04.799 align:start position:0%
of lack of
 
00:51:06.789 --> 00:51:06.799 align:start position:0%
transparency and the licensed
 
00:51:09.710 --> 00:51:09.720 align:start position:0%
individuals have been complaining to the
 
00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
legislature for at least the 15 years
 
00:51:15.150 --> 00:51:15.160 align:start position:0%
I've been here I mean possibly before I
 
00:51:17.589 --> 00:51:17.599 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be surprised but there are
 
00:51:21.270 --> 00:51:21.280 align:start position:0%
issues with various boards not sharing
 
00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
information not announcing their
 
00:51:27.390 --> 00:51:27.400 align:start position:0%
meetings and not being as transparent as
 
00:51:29.230 --> 00:51:29.240 align:start position:0%
we want the government to
 
00:51:32.870 --> 00:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
be so that's a good place to start the
 
00:51:35.470 --> 00:51:35.480 align:start position:0%
other reason to do it is that it's a
 
00:51:38.470 --> 00:51:38.480 align:start position:0%
relatively self-contained group we can
 
00:51:41.230 --> 00:51:41.240 align:start position:0%
Implement these changes at the
 
00:51:45.910 --> 00:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
oplc see how they work and if
 
00:51:49.789 --> 00:51:49.799 align:start position:0%
it does turn out to encourage the best
 
00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
practices that some organizations use
 
00:51:57.030 --> 00:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
we'd implement it through throughout all
 
00:51:59.430 --> 00:51:59.440 align:start position:0%
the boards and committees and other
 
00:52:00.950 --> 00:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
groups in the
 
00:52:03.829 --> 00:52:03.839 align:start position:0%
state but we'll we'll try it in the
 
00:52:06.990 --> 00:52:07.000 align:start position:0%
licensing boards give it a fair shake
 
00:52:09.589 --> 00:52:09.599 align:start position:0%
and then see if we can expand it
 
00:52:12.789 --> 00:52:12.799 align:start position:0%
everything so I'm going to vote against
 
00:52:19.109 --> 00:52:19.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
you state constitution requires a roll
 
00:52:24.910 --> 00:52:24.920 align:start position:0%
call 2/3 vote is required to overwrite a
 
00:52:26.910 --> 00:52:26.920 align:start position:0%
veto this will be a roll call vote
 
00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:40.450 align:start position:0%

Speaker if I believe government
 
00:54:03.630 --> 00:54:03.640 align:start position:0%
transparency is essential to a

is notwithstanding the governor's VTO

Weber thank you Mr
 
00:56:45.870 --> 00:56:45.880 align:start position:0%
Speaker this was a fairly simple bill it
 
00:56:48.950 --> 00:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
simply requires when a child enters
 
00:56:51.630 --> 00:56:51.640 align:start position:0%
daycare or school for a form to be
 
00:56:54.470 --> 00:56:54.480 align:start position:0%

testing
 
00:56:59.950 --> 00:56:59.960 align:start position:0%
previously we have a law that requires
 
00:57:01.950 --> 00:57:01.960 align:start position:0%
that we have exceptions in the current
 
00:57:05.029 --> 00:57:05.039 align:start position:0%
law but the problem that this bill was
 
00:57:07.950 --> 00:57:07.960 align:start position:0%
intended to address is that compliance
 
00:57:10.630 --> 00:57:10.640 align:start position:0%
has fallen off and we all know of the
 
00:57:13.950 --> 00:57:13.960 align:start position:0%
potential damages of lead poisoning in
 
00:57:17.670 --> 00:57:17.680 align:start position:0%
young children so the bill as it was
 
00:57:20.710 --> 00:57:20.720 align:start position:0%
passed by the house in the Senate merely
 
00:57:23.589 --> 00:57:23.599 align:start position:0%
provides another time and opportunity
 
00:57:26.390 --> 00:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
for parents to be given
 
00:57:28.990 --> 00:57:29.000 align:start position:0%
information if they have not had their
 
00:57:33.390 --> 00:57:33.400 align:start position:0%

that New Hampshire children are required

to have their blood levels tested at the
 
00:59:19.109 --> 00:59:19.119 align:start position:0%
ages of 1 and two because it needs to be
 
00:59:21.109 --> 00:59:21.119 align:start position:0%
done early in order to have appropriate

many children and child care care well
 
00:59:29.510 --> 00:59:29.520 align:start position:0%

and most importantly Mr Speaker if I
 
00:59:37.589 --> 00:59:37.599 align:start position:0%
know that the recent low Le testing
 
00:59:39.990 --> 00:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
level numbers weren't because parents
 
00:59:42.589 --> 00:59:42.599 align:start position:0%
weren't testing their children by choice
 
00:59:44.710 --> 00:59:44.720 align:start position:0%
but because they couldn't because the
 
00:59:47.630 --> 00:59:47.640 align:start position:0%

00:59:50.109 --> 00:59:50.119 align:start position:0%

01:12:41.229 --> 01:12:41.239 align:start position:0%
that the Supreme Court recently has said
 
01:12:43.229 --> 01:12:43.239 align:start position:0%
that the historical analysis method is
 
01:12:44.910 --> 01:12:44.920 align:start position:0%
to be used to determine the intent of
 
01:12:46.310 --> 01:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
the law or the
 
01:12:48.270 --> 01:12:48.280 align:start position:0%
Constitution this means that what the
 
01:12:50.070 --> 01:12:50.080 align:start position:0%
usages and customs of the time the law
 
01:12:52.590 --> 01:12:52.600 align:start position:0%
or Constitution was written determines
 
01:12:54.510 --> 01:12:54.520 align:start position:0%
how that law applied
 
01:12:57.110 --> 01:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
Today part one article two of the New
 
01:12:59.310 --> 01:12:59.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state constitution says the
 
01:13:01.870 --> 01:13:01.880 align:start position:0%
people have a right to give instructions
 
01:13:03.070 --> 01:13:03.080 align:start position:0%
to their
 
01:13:05.629 --> 01:13:05.639 align:start position:0%
representatives Webster's Dictionary of
 
01:13:08.030 --> 01:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
the American English language of
 
01:13:12.229 --> 01:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
1828 defines instruct as to give notice
 
01:13:15.110 --> 01:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
and also to impart knowledge or educate
 
01:13:18.430 --> 01:13:18.440 align:start position:0%
and also to direct or command to furnish
 
01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:19.590 align:start position:0%
and also to direct or command to furnish
with

01:13:19.590 --> 01:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:13:24.470 --> 01:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
orders article 38 of part one says quote
 
01:13:27.590 --> 01:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
the people they have a right to require
 
01:13:30.030 --> 01:13:30.040 align:start position:0%
of their lawgivers and magistrate an
 
01:13:32.629 --> 01:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
exact and constant observance of the
 
01:13:34.950 --> 01:13:34.960 align:start position:0%
fundamental principles of the
 
01:13:37.950 --> 01:13:37.960 align:start position:0%
Constitution Article 8 of part one says
 
01:13:39.950 --> 01:13:39.960 align:start position:0%
all power residing originally in and
 
01:13:42.709 --> 01:13:42.719 align:start position:0%
being derived from the people all the
 
01:13:44.550 --> 01:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
magistrates and officers of government
 
01:13:47.149 --> 01:13:47.159 align:start position:0%
are their substitutes and agents and at
 
01:13:49.590 --> 01:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
all times accountable to
 
01:13:53.310 --> 01:13:53.320 align:start position:0%
them some have said that well being
 
01:13:56.430 --> 01:13:56.440 align:start position:0%
being accountable means every 2 years
 
01:13:59.350 --> 01:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
the people have an election and they
 
01:14:03.310 --> 01:14:03.320 align:start position:0%
vote on us by um they vote on us and
 
01:14:06.149 --> 01:14:06.159 align:start position:0%
expect us to hold our campaign promises
 
01:14:09.550 --> 01:14:09.560 align:start position:0%
hold to them I don't find that concept
 
01:14:11.030 --> 01:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
anywhere in writing in the Constitution
 
01:14:13.629 --> 01:14:13.639 align:start position:0%
or the actual law and I don't see how
 
01:14:16.470 --> 01:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
that squares with part one article 8
 
01:14:19.550 --> 01:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
that says agents are accountable at all
 
01:14:22.990 --> 01:14:23.000 align:start position:0%
times nor part one article 38 that says
 
01:14:25.070 --> 01:14:25.080 align:start position:0%
EX exact and
 
01:14:27.390 --> 01:14:27.400 align:start position:0%
constant in reality the people have the
 
01:14:29.870 --> 01:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
right to instruct us as their agents
 
01:14:31.350 --> 01:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
when it comes to protecting their
 
01:14:33.870 --> 01:14:33.880 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights that's our primary
 
01:14:36.229 --> 01:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
job they have the right to provide us
 
01:14:38.310 --> 01:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
notice of a violation of their rights
 
01:14:41.030 --> 01:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
that we swore to protect and to instruct
 
01:14:44.310 --> 01:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
Us in remedying those violations in so
 
01:14:46.470 --> 01:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
far as it's within our Authority that
 
01:14:48.950 --> 01:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
they granted to us in the constitution
 
01:14:50.110 --> 01:14:50.120 align:start position:0%
in part
 
01:14:52.510 --> 01:14:52.520 align:start position:0%
two they can't tell us to stand on our
 
01:14:54.510 --> 01:14:54.520 align:start position:0%
heads but they can provide us notice
 
01:14:57.030 --> 01:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
that a state agency is violating rights
 
01:14:58.510 --> 01:14:58.520 align:start position:0%
and is in need of
 
01:15:00.750 --> 01:15:00.760 align:start position:0%
Correction they can instruct us to take
 
01:15:03.149 --> 01:15:03.159 align:start position:0%
action to rectify the situation with the
 
01:15:05.870 --> 01:15:05.880 align:start position:0%
powers that we have been given by them
 
01:15:07.750 --> 01:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
the people have a right to constant
 
01:15:09.870 --> 01:15:09.880 align:start position:0%
observance of the law by their
 
01:15:11.870 --> 01:15:11.880 align:start position:0%
magistrates and when constitutional
 
01:15:14.070 --> 01:15:14.080 align:start position:0%
rights are violated we magistrates have
 
01:15:16.910 --> 01:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
a duty under our oath to assist and make
 
01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:17.910 align:start position:0%
a duty under our oath to assist and make
it

01:15:17.910 --> 01:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:15:21.390 --> 01:15:21.400 align:start position:0%
right if we ignore please for help and
 
01:15:24.030 --> 01:15:24.040 align:start position:0%
continue to let people's rights be viol
 
01:15:27.390 --> 01:15:27.400 align:start position:0%
ated if later they do take it to court
 
01:15:28.669 --> 01:15:28.679 align:start position:0%
and it's found their rights were
 
01:15:32.229 --> 01:15:32.239 align:start position:0%
violated and we knew and did nothing we
 
01:15:33.870 --> 01:15:33.880 align:start position:0%
were given notice and said I don't have
 
01:15:37.470 --> 01:15:37.480 align:start position:0%
to do what you say and didn't give any
 
01:15:40.790 --> 01:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
evidence to that fact if we can't show
 
01:15:42.830 --> 01:15:42.840 align:start position:0%
that we don't have to then we become
 
01:15:46.070 --> 01:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
culpable we violated our oath and now
 
01:15:48.510 --> 01:15:48.520 align:start position:0%
we're a part of denying the people their
 
01:15:51.709 --> 01:15:51.719 align:start position:0%
rights we were derelict in our duty and
 
01:15:54.110 --> 01:15:54.120 align:start position:0%
that is maladministration
 
01:15:56.189 --> 01:15:56.199 align:start position:0%
and with notice it can rise to the level
 
01:15:56.199 --> 01:15:57.110 align:start position:0%
and with notice it can rise to the level
of

01:15:57.110 --> 01:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:15:59.750 --> 01:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
malice we can be held accountable and
 
01:16:02.189 --> 01:16:02.199 align:start position:0%
notices have been used in court to prove
 
01:16:04.790 --> 01:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
that a defendant has no plausible
 
01:16:07.030 --> 01:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
deniability so let's get back to the
 
01:16:09.510 --> 01:16:09.520 align:start position:0%
