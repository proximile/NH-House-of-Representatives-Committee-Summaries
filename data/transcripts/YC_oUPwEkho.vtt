wait

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:15.379 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 align:start position:0%
to keep going over there we go there we
 
00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:18.949 align:start position:0%
to keep going over there we go there we
go

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 align:start position:0%
go
 
00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 align:start position:0%
um if you could lead us in the Pledge of
 
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
so we have four bills to hear today
 
00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 align:start position:0%
these are
 
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 align:start position:0%
um abs and any
 
00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
surprises way out of left field these
 
00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 align:start position:0%
are our four Senate bills for the
 
00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 align:start position:0%
session so once we complete our public
 
00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 align:start position:0%
hearings today
 
00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 align:start position:0%
um that should be it and then I think
 
00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
will will probably want to review what
 
00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 align:start position:0%
we do today and then use that to
 
00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379 align:start position:0%
schedule hopefully a single executive
 
00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 align:start position:0%
session and hopefully in plenty of time
 
00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 align:start position:0%
so we're not up against any deadlines
 
00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 align:start position:0%
um so do you want to take a roll call
 
00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:11.159 align:start position:0%

relative to overpayment of unemployment

is the prime sponsor and will introduce
 
00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:34.199 align:start position:0%
the bill good morning thank you uh good
 
00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:36.539 align:start position:0%
morning sorry for the rush we are in the
 
00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 align:start position:0%
middle of session right now so I'm in
 
00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
two places at one time if you can't tell
 
00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 align:start position:0%
uh for the record my name is Becky
 
00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 align:start position:0%
Whitley I'm honored to represent Senate
 
00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 align:start position:0%
District 15 which includes the wonderful
 
00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 align:start position:0%
communities of Concord Penacook
 
00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
Hopkinton and Beau so I'm uh happy to
 
00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 align:start position:0%
introduce today Senate bill 42.
 
00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:57.720 align:start position:0%
um this is an issue uh that the Senate
 
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:00.900 align:start position:0%
has discussed for many years and this
 
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
product that you have before you is
 
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.340 align:start position:0%
really a refined version of what we had
 
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
been talking about in the senate for a
 
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:09.180 align:start position:0%
few years so simply put the bill
 
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400 align:start position:0%
prohibits the state from charging
 
00:06:13.249 --> 00:06:13.259 align:start position:0%
interest in the settlement of over
 
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
overpaid State unemployment Congress
 
00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:19.340 align:start position:0%
compensation where fraud is not an issue
 
00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:23.039 align:start position:0%
and like I said this is a very targeted
 
00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:26.580 align:start position:0%
um set of piece of policy and it's also
 
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:28.740 align:start position:0%
uh consistent with existing federal
 
00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:31.340 align:start position:0%
policy so the state is already
 
00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:34.139 align:start position:0%
prohibited from collecting interest on
 
00:06:37.249 --> 00:06:37.259 align:start position:0%
overpaid Federal compensation and in in
 
00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:39.180 align:start position:0%
the federal case that's regardless of
 
00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:40.979 align:start position:0%
fraud so this is a more New Hampshire
 
00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:43.560 align:start position:0%
targeted solution we're only looking for
 
00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:45.060 align:start position:0%
the prohibition on the collection of
 
00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:48.360 align:start position:0%
interests where fraud is not an issue
 
00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:50.340 align:start position:0%
to put this into context around the
 
00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:54.120 align:start position:0%
around this country 22 states do not
 
00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:56.360 align:start position:0%
charge interest on state unemployment
 
00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire also does not charge
 
00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:01.860 align:start position:0%
interest on any other benefit so I think
 
00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:03.060 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
um important policy because we don't
 
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:06.900 align:start position:0%
want to be singling out this particular
 
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
benefit to charge interest on so I'm
 
00:07:11.689 --> 00:07:11.699 align:start position:0%
sure this committee is well aware that
 
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
covid related job losses in New
 
00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:16.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire included new folks to the
 
00:07:18.469 --> 00:07:18.479 align:start position:0%
unemployment Arena gig workers business
 
00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:21.060 align:start position:0%
owners those staying home for dependent
 
00:07:25.189 --> 00:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
care issues or exposure to the IRS by
 
00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:27.900 align:start position:0%
the time an overpayment is discovered in
 
00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:30.060 align:start position:0%
most cases that money is already spent
 
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
on rent food Child Care things like that
 
00:07:37.909 --> 00:07:37.919 align:start position:0%
so the data is also showing us that our
 
00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:40.500 align:start position:0%
service and healthcare workers our
 
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
sectors are being more impacted right
 
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
the majority of folks holding these jobs
 
00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:46.380 align:start position:0%
are women so we know that women are
 
00:07:49.309 --> 00:07:49.319 align:start position:0%
being disproportionately impacted by uh
 
00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:51.060 align:start position:0%
the unemployment situation and so
 
00:07:54.469 --> 00:07:54.479 align:start position:0%
therefore in uh that's another important
 
00:07:55.969 --> 00:07:55.979 align:start position:0%
policy that we're talking about today
 
00:07:57.890 --> 00:07:57.900 align:start position:0%
towards equity
 
00:07:59.749 --> 00:07:59.759 align:start position:0%
in the past couple years New Hampshire
 
00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:02.220 align:start position:0%
women lost more jobs than men they have
 
00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
taken on more caregiving
 
00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:05.400 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and served as the
 
00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:07.020 align:start position:0%
majority of essential workers on the
 
00:08:10.189 --> 00:08:10.199 align:start position:0%
front lines of the covet pandemic so uh
 
00:08:13.189 --> 00:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
the Senate felt very clearly this past
 
00:08:15.409 --> 00:08:15.419 align:start position:0%
unanimously in
 
00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:17.940 align:start position:0%
um Senate Edna and again on the floor
 
00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:19.620 align:start position:0%
that applying interest on state
 
00:08:21.529 --> 00:08:21.539 align:start position:0%
unemployment overpayments is really
 
00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:23.340 align:start position:0%
overly punitive and it's particularly
 
00:08:25.909 --> 00:08:25.919 align:start position:0%
cruel and and really unnecessary as we
 
00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
are rebuilding our Workforce coming out
 
00:08:29.689 --> 00:08:29.699 align:start position:0%
of the pandemic
 
00:08:32.149 --> 00:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
um I'm happy to take any questions but I
 
00:08:33.889 --> 00:08:33.899 align:start position:0%
certainly am not the expert on this
 
00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:35.700 align:start position:0%
topic and there are some folks behind me
 
00:08:38.449 --> 00:08:38.459 align:start position:0%
that can speak more to those the stories
 
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
of perhaps those who are on unemployment
 
00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:41.820 align:start position:0%
and of course the Department of Labor
 
00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:43.919 align:start position:0%
can also speak specifically to this
 
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
issue so thank you for having me this
 
00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:46.500 align:start position:0%
morning and I'm happy to take any
 
00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:48.300 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much are the
 
00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:49.730 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much are the
questions

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:49.740 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:51.660 align:start position:0%
representative love
 
00:08:53.449 --> 00:08:53.459 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you senator for
 
00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:55.380 align:start position:0%
taking my question do you know what the
 
00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:57.060 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire prosecutes uh
 
00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:01.500 align:start position:0%
fraud cases in this case uh uh so you I
 
00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:03.660 align:start position:0%
think that's a question for the
 
00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:05.700 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor you know this bill
 
00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:07.080 align:start position:0%
is really just targeted at that
 
00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:09.060 align:start position:0%
collection of Interest so certainly he
 
00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
he could speak um I think the deputy
 
00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
Commissioners here can speak to their
 
00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:15.060 align:start position:0%
efforts on fraud issues but again this
 
00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:17.220 align:start position:0%
bill is specifically targeted at
 
00:09:18.769 --> 00:09:18.779 align:start position:0%
prohibiting interest in cases where
 
00:09:22.009 --> 00:09:22.019 align:start position:0%
fraud is not an issue thank you
 
00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:25.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testing
 
00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:28.620 align:start position:0%

so I only have one additional card put
in

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:39.240 align:start position:0%

it doesn't look like there can be
 
00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:56.389 --> 00:09:56.399 align:start position:0%

the policy director at New Hampshire
 
00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:16.200 align:start position:0%
legal assistance
 
00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:19.200 align:start position:0%
you I do not have written copies or
 
00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
written testimony this morning you
 
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
received an email from my colleague
 
00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:25.860 align:start position:0%
Steve Tower last night I believe
 
00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:28.380 align:start position:0%
um expressing our support for this bill
 
00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:30.240 align:start position:0%
we've been representing clients we're a
 
00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:33.300 align:start position:0%
non-profit Law Firm that represents
 
00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:36.540 align:start position:0%
low-income and elderly clients across
 
00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:40.860 align:start position:0%
the state and we we worked um
 
00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
heavily representing folks during the
 
00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:46.260 align:start position:0%
pandemic related to unemployment and we
 
00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:48.240 align:start position:0%
support this bill and urge you to vote
 
00:10:49.069 --> 00:10:49.079 align:start position:0%
ought to pass
 
00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:50.820 align:start position:0%
we are one of New Hampshire's one of
 
00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:52.500 align:start position:0%
only 17 states which collects interest
 
00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:55.140 align:start position:0%
on non-fraud overpayments
 
00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
um that interest is it a rate of one
 
00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:00.380 align:start position:0%
percent monthly 12 percent for a year
 
00:11:03.889 --> 00:11:03.899 align:start position:0%
and the sorry I just realized I can't
 
00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:05.940 align:start position:0%
read without my with my glasses on
 
00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:07.850 align:start position:0%
read without my with my glasses on
anymore

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:07.860 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:08.870 align:start position:0%
anymore
um

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
so this is a situation where folks have
 
00:11:16.329 --> 00:11:16.339 align:start position:0%
not committed fraud they have made
 
00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
erroneously overpaid received
 
00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:21.300 align:start position:0%
erroneously overpaid
 
00:11:23.569 --> 00:11:23.579 align:start position:0%
um benefits
 
00:11:23.579 --> 00:11:24.829 align:start position:0%
um benefits
um

00:11:24.829 --> 00:11:24.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:26.820 align:start position:0%
and a lot of that can be attributed to
 
00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:28.740 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic you know things were
 
00:11:31.509 --> 00:11:31.519 align:start position:0%
changing really quickly and um
 
00:11:33.949 --> 00:11:33.959 align:start position:0%
there are many honest mistakes made in
 
00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
completing the paperwork and confusion
 
00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
and misunderstandings about the
 
00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:40.740 align:start position:0%
requirements and so
 
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
um and many of the folks who made these
 
00:11:44.449 --> 00:11:44.459 align:start position:0%
claims also have other difficulties
 
00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
whether it's you know language access or
 
00:11:50.389 --> 00:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
various disabilities and so we would
 
00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
just really encourage you to pass this
 
00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
bill and I would defer any kind of more
 
00:11:57.230 --> 00:11:57.240 align:start position:0%
substantive questions to the Deputy
 
00:11:58.970 --> 00:11:58.980 align:start position:0%
Commissioner but
 
00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
um we're supportive
 
00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much are there
 
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.190 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much are there
questions

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:04.200 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:12:06.889 --> 00:12:06.899 align:start position:0%
clerk hi
 
00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:09.060 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure if
 
00:12:11.329 --> 00:12:11.339 align:start position:0%
um you can answer this or maybe this is
 
00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
for the Deputy Commissioner but do we do
 
00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:18.180 align:start position:0%
you have a sense of like what causes
 
00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
these overpayments is it the something I
 
00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
mean if it's not fraud that implies that
 
00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:28.380 align:start position:0%
the person who would be charged interest
 
00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:30.230 align:start position:0%
the person who would be charged interest
currently

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:30.240 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
um didn't do anything wrong right so
 
00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:34.860 align:start position:0%
what are the what is the reason for the
 
00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
over payments like before covet because
 
00:12:39.829 --> 00:12:39.839 align:start position:0%
I understand this was an issue before
 
00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:41.700 align:start position:0%
can I have a second question
 
00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:43.860 align:start position:0%
I could I I'm sure that the Deputy
 
00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:45.180 align:start position:0%
Commissioner could expand on this much
 
00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:48.720 align:start position:0%
more in much more detail but um I think
 
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
generally particularly I can speak to
 
00:12:53.329 --> 00:12:53.339 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic it was the confusion
 
00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
with creating with um kind of evolving
 
00:12:57.949 --> 00:12:57.959 align:start position:0%
it was an evolving situation right with
 
00:12:59.690 --> 00:12:59.700 align:start position:0%
the pandemic and then also with the
 
00:13:02.569 --> 00:13:02.579 align:start position:0%
unemployment I think the department did
 
00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:04.200 align:start position:0%
um amazing work to get the benefits out
 
00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:06.540 align:start position:0%
as quickly as possible and in the
 
00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
process I think some folks
 
00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:10.380 align:start position:0%
you know made mistakes when they were
 
00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:12.240 align:start position:0%
completing the paperwork and the
 
00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
requirements were kind of evolving and
 
00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:15.720 align:start position:0%
things like that so just I would say
 
00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:18.240 align:start position:0%
honest mistakes around you know
 
00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:19.870 align:start position:0%
honest mistakes around you know
reporting

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:19.880 align:start position:0%
reporting
 
00:13:23.449 --> 00:13:23.459 align:start position:0%
second question thank you Mr chair
 
00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
um do we have a sense of how many people
 
00:13:30.769 --> 00:13:30.779 align:start position:0%
that owe interest at this point is there
 
00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
a rough number and what the average
 
00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.550 align:start position:0%
a rough number and what the average
person

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
is charged in interest you know on an
 
00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:39.300 align:start position:0%
average case basis
 
00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
um I unfortunately don't have that data
 
00:13:42.829 --> 00:13:42.839 align:start position:0%
I imagine the Deputy Commissioner might
 
00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:45.720 align:start position:0%
but I can't speak for him either so I
 
00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.269 align:start position:0%
but I can't speak for him either so I
apologize

00:13:47.269 --> 00:13:47.279 align:start position:0%
apologize
 
00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:49.800 align:start position:0%
further questions representative Cahill
 
00:13:51.769 --> 00:13:51.779 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking the
 
00:13:53.389 --> 00:13:53.399 align:start position:0%
question I I will follow up with the
 
00:13:55.129 --> 00:13:55.139 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner but my understanding
 
00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
is that he's had the capability to waive
 
00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:01.680 align:start position:0%
uh in these cases and has done so uh I
 
00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
think it
 
00:14:05.329 --> 00:14:05.339 align:start position:0%
uh wherever wherever possible so I
 
00:14:08.569 --> 00:14:08.579 align:start position:0%
certainly support the bill and uh and I
 
00:14:10.069 --> 00:14:10.079 align:start position:0%
think we're going to pass this rather
 
00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
easily but I think that has been the
 
00:14:14.629 --> 00:14:14.639 align:start position:0%
past and when they find that there is a
 
00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:16.380 align:start position:0%
mistake whether the department made a
 
00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:18.420 align:start position:0%
mistake or changing the rules they don't
 
00:14:23.569 --> 00:14:23.579 align:start position:0%
go after the uh the innocent uh claimant
 
00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:25.500 align:start position:0%
um I would let the Deputy Commissioner
 
00:14:28.129 --> 00:14:28.139 align:start position:0%
respond to that I I know that there is
 
00:14:31.069 --> 00:14:31.079 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to apply for waivers but
 
00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
um I don't know to what like what
 
00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
distinctions there are or anything like
 
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
that I'm not I'm not personally a case
 
00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:38.940 align:start position:0%
Handler so I don't want to misspeak
 
00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:40.620 align:start position:0%
thank you yep
 
00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:43.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:45.720 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:46.430 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
you

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:49.380 align:start position:0%
and as I said my last card is from
 
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner labors of the New
 
00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:56.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:59.530 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:14:59.530 --> 00:14:59.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
good morning members of the committee
 
00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
just for the record Richard Labor's
 
00:15:03.829 --> 00:15:03.839 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner New Hampshire
 
00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
Department of Employment Security
 
00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:07.860 align:start position:0%
um the department is neutral on this
 
00:15:10.129 --> 00:15:10.139 align:start position:0%
bill so the department takes uh no
 
00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:12.180 align:start position:0%
position and what I was hoping to do was
 
00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:14.100 align:start position:0%
just provide a little
 
00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:16.680 align:start position:0%
um further explanation with regard to
 
00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:19.860 align:start position:0%
types of overpayments or improper
 
00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:22.740 align:start position:0%
payments payments that should not have
 
00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:24.540 align:start position:0%
been made to a person because they are
 
00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:27.720 align:start position:0%
subsequently found ineligible and also
 
00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:31.980 align:start position:0%
just try to put it into context so
 
00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
fraud overpayments are off the table
 
00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
right with this bill this bill is not
 
00:15:38.629 --> 00:15:38.639 align:start position:0%
dealing with those instances in which
 
00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:42.680 align:start position:0%
someone is found to have willfully made
 
00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
misstatements to the department in order
 
00:15:47.569 --> 00:15:47.579 align:start position:0%
to collect benefits to answer
 
00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:49.380 align:start position:0%
representative Love's question with
 
00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
regard to criminal treatment of some of
 
00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:53.720 align:start position:0%
those the department pursues
 
00:15:57.170 --> 00:15:57.180 align:start position:0%
unemployment fraud very aggressively so
 
00:15:59.930 --> 00:15:59.940 align:start position:0%
we have a partnership with the criminal
 
00:16:02.449 --> 00:16:02.459 align:start position:0%
Bureau at the Department of Justice we
 
00:16:05.569 --> 00:16:05.579 align:start position:0%
actually fund a full-time prosecutor
 
00:16:08.449 --> 00:16:08.459 align:start position:0%
that handles unemployment fraud they
 
00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:10.620 align:start position:0%
focus a hundred percent of their
 
00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:13.500 align:start position:0%
attention on earnings related fraud so
 
00:16:16.129 --> 00:16:16.139 align:start position:0%
instances where someone files for
 
00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits is found eligible
 
00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:20.820 align:start position:0%
so they had a qualifying separation they
 
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
were unemployed through no fault of
 
00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:25.500 align:start position:0%
their own subsequent to that they then
 
00:16:28.069 --> 00:16:28.079 align:start position:0%
find new employment or return to Old
 
00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:30.360 align:start position:0%
employment and don't report that to the
 
00:16:32.689 --> 00:16:32.699 align:start position:0%
department despite being asked that on
 
00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
their weekly claim so they're collecting
 
00:16:36.889 --> 00:16:36.899 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits and they're
 
00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:39.720 align:start position:0%
receiving regular wages from new
 
00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
employment and they don't report it we
 
00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:45.620 align:start position:0%
always find out about those situations
 
00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:48.060 align:start position:0%
and we try to stress that to individuals
 
00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:50.100 align:start position:0%
when they come in in the early part of
 
00:16:52.189 --> 00:16:52.199 align:start position:0%
their claim but yet people still will
 
00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:55.740 align:start position:0%
engage in that type of behavior so in a
 
00:16:58.310 --> 00:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
in an effort to try to deter that from
 
00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:00.420 align:start position:0%
going ahead in the future we've had this
 
00:17:02.569 --> 00:17:02.579 align:start position:0%
relationship with the Attorney General's
 
00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
office since 2015 I believe I actually
 
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
have an interview at 11 30 over there
 
00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:09.579 align:start position:0%
have an interview at 11 30 over there
with

00:17:09.579 --> 00:17:09.589 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:17:09.589 --> 00:17:11.569 align:start position:0%
with
[Music]

00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:11.579 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:17:11.579 --> 00:17:12.169 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

00:17:12.169 --> 00:17:12.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:14.809 --> 00:17:14.819 align:start position:0%
uh Sean Gill the chief of staff for the
 
00:17:16.610 --> 00:17:16.620 align:start position:0%
Attorney General to interview people for
 
00:17:19.309 --> 00:17:19.319 align:start position:0%
Phil our prosecutor position because our
 
00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:21.780 align:start position:0%
prosecutor just left to go to another
 
00:17:24.049 --> 00:17:24.059 align:start position:0%
position in state government so we want
 
00:17:25.610 --> 00:17:25.620 align:start position:0%
to fill that quickly so it's a strong
 
00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:28.260 align:start position:0%
partnership when individuals engages and
 
00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:31.500 align:start position:0%
engage in egregious behavior that they
 
00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:33.780 align:start position:0%
they continue to file for unemployment
 
00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
despite going back to work and it's
 
00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:39.240 align:start position:0%
situations that's clearly greed and not
 
00:17:42.529 --> 00:17:42.539 align:start position:0%
need those individuals are prosecuted
 
00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:45.240 align:start position:0%
most of those cases settle because the
 
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
evidence is so is so strong against the
 
00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:51.240 align:start position:0%
individual and in more cases than not
 
00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:54.660 align:start position:0%
those individuals do actual jail time so
 
00:17:56.990 --> 00:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
they have stand committed time they
 
00:17:59.870 --> 00:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
spend in some cases it might be a few
 
00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
days other cases depending on the length
 
00:18:05.029 --> 00:18:05.039 align:start position:0%
of their fraud could be a few weeks but
 
00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:08.220 align:start position:0%
they spend time in prison and we make
 
00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
sure to sing that from the rooftops not
 
00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:12.720 align:start position:0%
because we're proud of it but we want to
 
00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
know for other individuals in our role
 
00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:17.640 align:start position:0%
of protecting the trust fund to make
 
00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
sure that those tax payments are
 
00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:22.260 align:start position:0%
available for people that are rightfully
 
00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
collecting and need them that we take
 
00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:26.700 align:start position:0%
that role very seriously and that
 
00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:28.500 align:start position:0%
they're a very serious repercussions for
 
00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
engaging in that type of behavior so we
 
00:18:33.529 --> 00:18:33.539 align:start position:0%
have press releases that are on poster
 
00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:35.100 align:start position:0%
board in our offices we remind
 
00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
individuals of that when they come in
 
00:18:39.169 --> 00:18:39.179 align:start position:0%
for their workshop at their beginning of
 
00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:41.160 align:start position:0%
their unemployment claim
 
00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:42.780 align:start position:0%
um so we're we're very aggressive with
 
00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
that but not to confuse things here this
 
00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
bill does has nothing to do with
 
00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:51.200 align:start position:0%
unemployment fraud so unemployment fraud
 
00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
if you're found to have engaged in that
 
00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:56.100 align:start position:0%
activity you're found overpaid either
 
00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:00.360 align:start position:0%
criminally or civilly that debt carries
 
00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
statutory interest at one percent a
 
00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:04.620 align:start position:0%
month and this bill wouldn't touch that
 
00:19:08.029 --> 00:19:08.039 align:start position:0%
so the types of improper payments that
 
00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:11.580 align:start position:0%
this bill would impact fall into one of
 
00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
two buckets so these are non-fraud
 
00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
overpayments and these are situations
 
00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:19.140 align:start position:0%
where the individual is either
 
00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:23.820 align:start position:0%
determined to be at fault in creating
 
00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
the situation where they were paid and
 
00:19:28.549 --> 00:19:28.559 align:start position:0%
they should not have been or they are
 
00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
without fault so the easier situation to
 
00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:34.260 align:start position:0%
describe is when they're without fault
 
00:19:37.789 --> 00:19:37.799 align:start position:0%
that's when the department screws up it
 
00:19:37.799 --> 00:19:38.890 align:start position:0%
that's when the department screws up it
happens

00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:38.900 align:start position:0%
happens
 
00:19:44.029 --> 00:19:44.039 align:start position:0%
and during the pandemic as Dawn was just
 
00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:45.780 align:start position:0%
explaining what the federal government
 
00:19:49.789 --> 00:19:49.799 align:start position:0%
changing rules seemingly every week that
 
00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:52.740 align:start position:0%
happens more than it would in regular
 
00:19:56.029 --> 00:19:56.039 align:start position:0%
times but what we do in those situations
 
00:19:58.850 --> 00:19:58.860 align:start position:0%
with New Hampshire Law requires in those
 
00:20:01.669 --> 00:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
situations is that if you are without
 
00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:05.100 align:start position:0%
fault in creating an overpayment so your
 
00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:07.500 align:start position:0%
paid benefits which you should not have
 
00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:09.900 align:start position:0%
been and it's not your fault it's either
 
00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
the Department's fault or perhaps an
 
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
employer's fault you do not have to
 
00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:17.880 align:start position:0%
repay those benefits so interest never
 
00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
accrues on those types of improperly
 
00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:23.340 align:start position:0%
paid benefits you'll receive a
 
00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:25.020 align:start position:0%
determination from the Department it
 
00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:27.780 align:start position:0%
will say you are ineligible because and
 
00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:29.880 align:start position:0%
we'll explain that and then it will go
 
00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
on to say that because you are without
 
00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:35.460 align:start position:0%
fault you do not have to repay those
 
00:20:37.669 --> 00:20:37.679 align:start position:0%
benefits so there's no debt that the
 
00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:40.620 align:start position:0%
individual who is paid when they
 
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have and it is not their fault
 
00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
there is no debt that they have to the
 
00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:46.390 align:start position:0%
there is no debt that they have to the
department

00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:46.400 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:20:49.789 --> 00:20:49.799 align:start position:0%
and obviously no interest accruing
 
00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:52.260 align:start position:0%
because there's no debt so that's the
 
00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:53.580 align:start position:0%
easier bucket
 
00:20:57.049 --> 00:20:57.059 align:start position:0%
and I can I can explain the other bucket
 
00:20:58.430 --> 00:20:58.440 align:start position:0%
and then maybe that will answer the
 
00:21:00.529 --> 00:21:00.539 align:start position:0%
question and then we can come back to it
 
00:21:03.289 --> 00:21:03.299 align:start position:0%
or you're in control not me so I can
 
00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:05.820 align:start position:0%
answer the question now too
 
00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:07.250 align:start position:0%
answer the question now too
okay

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:07.260 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:09.240 align:start position:0%
um so the other types of improper
 
00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
improperly paid benefits that are
 
00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:14.220 align:start position:0%
non-fraud are situations where the
 
00:21:17.029 --> 00:21:17.039 align:start position:0%
individual is determined to be at fault
 
00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:20.700 align:start position:0%
so they were found eligible they're
 
00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:23.700 align:start position:0%
they're paid weekly benefits and
 
00:21:25.909 --> 00:21:25.919 align:start position:0%
um is then determined that information
 
00:21:29.149 --> 00:21:29.159 align:start position:0%
that they provided that was material to
 
00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:32.280 align:start position:0%
finding them eligible was inaccurate or
 
00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:35.220 align:start position:0%
misleading or perhaps information that
 
00:21:37.909 --> 00:21:37.919 align:start position:0%
they did not provide should have been
 
00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
provided and would have been reasonable
 
00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
to have been provided so if that is
 
00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:45.720 align:start position:0%
determined that individual would be
 
00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
found ineligible for the period of time
 
00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
that they were paid and those conditions
 
00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:55.220 align:start position:0%
were applicable they would then be
 
00:21:57.950 --> 00:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
explained in that determination that
 
00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:01.500 align:start position:0%
they were with fault and why and then
 
00:22:05.029 --> 00:22:05.039 align:start position:0%
they would be told that they have to
 
00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
repay the benefit benefits which they
 
00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:08.820 align:start position:0%
were paid that they shouldn't have
 
00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:10.740 align:start position:0%
because they were determined to be at
 
00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:14.220 align:start position:0%
fault in those benefits being paid now
 
00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
each and every one of those
 
00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
determinations the individual can file
 
00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:20.220 align:start position:0%
an appeal so the appeal rights are right
 
00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
on that so they have the full
 
00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:23.710 align:start position:0%
on that so they have the full
administrative

00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:23.720 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
appeals remedies available to them so if
 
00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:28.860 align:start position:0%
they disagree with that determination
 
00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
they can appeal it they can have a
 
00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
hearing before a hearing officer and
 
00:22:34.789 --> 00:22:34.799 align:start position:0%
they can have an opportunity to further
 
00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
make their argument as to why something
 
00:22:39.289 --> 00:22:39.299 align:start position:0%
is wrong with that determination
 
00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:43.320 align:start position:0%
interest does not accrue if they file an
 
00:22:45.289 --> 00:22:45.299 align:start position:0%
appeal or challenge a determination
 
00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:48.360 align:start position:0%
finding them overpaid there's no debt
 
00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:50.280 align:start position:0%
the determination is not considered
 
00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
final at that point
 
00:22:55.730 --> 00:22:55.740 align:start position:0%
when they have exhausted their Appeals
 
00:22:59.450 --> 00:22:59.460 align:start position:0%
and the debt is then final that is when
 
00:23:01.909 --> 00:23:01.919 align:start position:0%
they have an overpayment they have a
 
00:23:04.669 --> 00:23:04.679 align:start position:0%
debt to the department for which they
 
00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
would need to repay because they are
 
00:23:09.529 --> 00:23:09.539 align:start position:0%
with fault in creating it now the first
 
00:23:12.049 --> 00:23:12.059 align:start position:0%
60 days upon that debt becoming final
 
00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:15.360 align:start position:0%
are interest free so the individual has
 
00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
those 60 days to repay that debt
 
00:23:21.049 --> 00:23:21.059 align:start position:0%
um without accruing any interest
 
00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:23.580 align:start position:0%
after that 60-day period interest
 
00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
accrues at that one percent per month
 
00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
per the section of 282a that requires
 
00:23:33.169 --> 00:23:33.179 align:start position:0%
interest to be applied
 
00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
um now the department does not
 
00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:38.220 align:start position:0%
um simply require individuals to repay
 
00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:40.440 align:start position:0%
those debts all at once in an
 
00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:44.580 align:start position:0%
unreasonable fashion we do as many any
 
00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:46.980 align:start position:0%
other agency does as the court does when
 
00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:50.580 align:start position:0%
individuals have have debts we engage in
 
00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:52.860 align:start position:0%
a process with those individuals we they
 
00:23:55.669 --> 00:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
fill out Financial affidavits certifying
 
00:23:57.409 --> 00:23:57.419 align:start position:0%
as to income and expenses and we
 
00:23:59.649 --> 00:23:59.659 align:start position:0%
determine what their ability to pay is
 
00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:03.480 align:start position:0%
so we engage in that process in-house at
 
00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
the department now so it's those
 
00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:09.780 align:start position:0%
individuals that have been not
 
00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:11.480 align:start position:0%
determined to have gauged in fraud
 
00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:14.460 align:start position:0%
because again our fraud resources are
 
00:24:16.909 --> 00:24:16.919 align:start position:0%
really focused on those unreported
 
00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:19.740 align:start position:0%
earnings type of situations
 
00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
um and they are determined to have been
 
00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:25.020 align:start position:0%
at fault in causing the overpayment and
 
00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:27.240 align:start position:0%
those are the only individuals that are
 
00:24:30.529 --> 00:24:30.539 align:start position:0%
required to repay those those benefits
 
00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
and those are the only individuals that
 
00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:34.380 align:start position:0%
accrue interest
 
00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:36.900 align:start position:0%
um if they carry that debt Beyond 60
 
00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
days now some situations that you know
 
00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:43.140 align:start position:0%
beyond the situations during the
 
00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:46.380 align:start position:0%
pandemic for a non-fraud overpayment are
 
00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:49.380 align:start position:0%
not the situations that we have now so
 
00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:51.980 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic you're dealing with
 
00:24:55.450 --> 00:24:55.460 align:start position:0%
a lot of self-employed individuals who
 
00:24:58.070 --> 00:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
were unable to substantiate their
 
00:24:59.930 --> 00:24:59.940 align:start position:0%
business activity in the and the federal
 
00:25:01.789 --> 00:25:01.799 align:start position:0%
government required that in order to
 
00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:04.500 align:start position:0%
collect benefits that was a a common
 
00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:07.260 align:start position:0%
situation to be a non-fraud overpayment
 
00:25:09.669 --> 00:25:09.679 align:start position:0%
but those situations don't exist now
 
00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:11.700 align:start position:0%
self-employed individuals don't have
 
00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:13.500 align:start position:0%
eligibility for regular State
 
00:25:15.529 --> 00:25:15.539 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits so the situations
 
00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:18.240 align:start position:0%
that we see now are the ones that you
 
00:25:21.130 --> 00:25:21.140 align:start position:0%
would expect effect so
 
00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:24.440 align:start position:0%
the circumstances of your separation
 
00:25:28.669 --> 00:25:28.679 align:start position:0%
maybe not being entirely accurate in how
 
00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:32.220 align:start position:0%
you've described them to the Department
 
00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:34.200 align:start position:0%
um perhaps the
 
00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
um your work search efforts that are
 
00:25:39.289 --> 00:25:39.299 align:start position:0%
required on your weekly claim perhaps
 
00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
those are determined not to be accurate
 
00:25:45.529 --> 00:25:45.539 align:start position:0%
so if it's determined that that
 
00:25:45.539 --> 00:25:47.630 align:start position:0%
so if it's determined that that
information

00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:47.640 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:49.860 align:start position:0%
um should have been provided or was
 
00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:52.200 align:start position:0%
provided in a way that was inaccurate
 
00:25:56.029 --> 00:25:56.039 align:start position:0%
and was reasonable to know that you were
 
00:25:57.470 --> 00:25:57.480 align:start position:0%
not providing the correct information
 
00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
you will be at fault and you'll have to
 
00:26:03.049 --> 00:26:03.059 align:start position:0%
repay that amount now we're not focusing
 
00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:05.640 align:start position:0%
our fraud investigative resources on
 
00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:07.500 align:start position:0%
those situations again we're focusing
 
00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
those on unreported earnings so why some
 
00:26:14.029 --> 00:26:14.039 align:start position:0%
why they're why they don't rise to the
 
00:26:15.529 --> 00:26:15.539 align:start position:0%
level of fraud
 
00:26:18.529 --> 00:26:18.539 align:start position:0%
you know the the real fraud that we're
 
00:26:20.149 --> 00:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
worried about again is those unreported
 
00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
earnings not necessarily tagging someone
 
00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:27.240 align:start position:0%
for fraud for misrepresenting
 
00:26:28.789 --> 00:26:28.799 align:start position:0%
um of some things on their work search
 
00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
they'll find be found overpaid they'll
 
00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:32.940 align:start position:0%
have to repay it in right now at a
 
00:26:34.269 --> 00:26:34.279 align:start position:0%
cruise interest but we're not
 
00:26:37.909 --> 00:26:37.919 align:start position:0%
considering those one weakers or those
 
00:26:37.919 --> 00:26:39.610 align:start position:0%
considering those one weakers or those
short

00:26:39.610 --> 00:26:39.620 align:start position:0%
short
 
00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
periods of time for a fraud
 
00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
investigation investigations at this
 
00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:46.440 align:start position:0%
point so that's kind of the lay of the
 
00:26:48.649 --> 00:26:48.659 align:start position:0%
land and and the context for how
 
00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:52.380 align:start position:0%
individuals would find themselves to be
 
00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:53.510 align:start position:0%
individuals would find themselves to be
um

00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:56.100 align:start position:0%
in the circumstance where they have been
 
00:26:58.190 --> 00:26:58.200 align:start position:0%
paid benefits to which they are later
 
00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
found to be ineligible and then the
 
00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:02.700 align:start position:0%
situations in which they would have to
 
00:27:05.570 --> 00:27:05.580 align:start position:0%
repay those and when when and when
 
00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:08.220 align:start position:0%
interest does not accrue so I hope hope
 
00:27:09.769 --> 00:27:09.779 align:start position:0%
that was helpful
 
00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:11.820 align:start position:0%
um in terms of numbers
 
00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:15.740 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at calendar year 2022
 
00:27:19.029 --> 00:27:19.039 align:start position:0%
there were about
 
00:27:23.769 --> 00:27:23.779 align:start position:0%
2400 claimants that were found overpaid
 
00:27:27.049 --> 00:27:27.059 align:start position:0%
the total amount of overpaid benefits
 
00:27:31.549 --> 00:27:31.559 align:start position:0%
was 2.7 million dollars that's out of uh
 
00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:33.960 align:start position:0%
25 and a half million that was paid out
 
00:27:36.529 --> 00:27:36.539 align:start position:0%
in regular State unemployment so a
 
00:27:39.049 --> 00:27:39.059 align:start position:0%
little over 10 percent was found to be
 
00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
improperly paid that's a little bit
 
00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
higher than uh historically where New
 
00:27:45.970 --> 00:27:45.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has been
 
00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:50.400 align:start position:0%
we are one of the states that had
 
00:27:52.970 --> 00:27:52.980 align:start position:0%
achieved the federal Benchmark of having
 
00:27:55.970 --> 00:27:55.980 align:start position:0%
less than 10 percent of benefits paid be
 
00:27:58.789 --> 00:27:58.799 align:start position:0%
determined to be improper leading up to
 
00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:03.720 align:start position:0%
the pandemic my guess is that in uh you
 
00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:05.880 align:start position:0%
know the first quarter here in 2023
 
00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:08.580 align:start position:0%
that's probably back where we are I
 
00:28:10.909 --> 00:28:10.919 align:start position:0%
don't have those numbers but we usually
 
00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:12.360 align:start position:0%
hover in that eight to nine percent
 
00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
range so that 10 10 is a little bit
 
00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:17.580 align:start position:0%
higher than historical Norms
 
00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:21.720 align:start position:0%
um of that 2.7 million that was found to
 
00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:26.940 align:start position:0%
be overpaid about 45 of that are 1.2
 
00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:29.820 align:start position:0%
million was in situations where the
 
00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:32.340 align:start position:0%
individual was at fault in creating the
 
00:28:34.669 --> 00:28:34.679 align:start position:0%
overpayment so those are the situations
 
00:28:37.970 --> 00:28:37.980 align:start position:0%
that we what would be impacted here with
 
00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:40.380 align:start position:0%
Senate bill 42. so again that was about
 
00:28:45.289 --> 00:28:45.299 align:start position:0%
45 of those overpayments from 2022 about
 
00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
1.2 million dollars was the amount that
 
00:28:51.649 --> 00:28:51.659 align:start position:0%
individuals would have to repay and that
 
00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:53.400 align:start position:0%
which would accrue interest if they
 
00:28:57.529 --> 00:28:57.539 align:start position:0%
didn't repay that amount within 60 days
 
00:29:00.169 --> 00:29:00.179 align:start position:0%
right thank you and before I go to you I
 
00:29:01.789 --> 00:29:01.799 align:start position:0%
do have a question about
 
00:29:06.169 --> 00:29:06.179 align:start position:0%
so the difference between at fault fraud
 
00:29:09.289 --> 00:29:09.299 align:start position:0%
and if I read the language proposed in
 
00:29:11.269 --> 00:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
this bill is there some kind of gray
 
00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:14.100 align:start position:0%
area in there and what I'm getting at is
 
00:29:16.810 --> 00:29:16.820 align:start position:0%
might we see kind of a
 
00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
unintended shift in enforcement or
 
00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:25.140 align:start position:0%
investigation because of the way the the
 
00:29:27.529 --> 00:29:27.539 align:start position:0%
penalties are restructured
 
00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:29.340 align:start position:0%
um so the the language and the statute
 
00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:31.500 align:start position:0%
with regard to fraud requires an in
 
00:29:35.450 --> 00:29:35.460 align:start position:0%
order to be found to have engaged in
 
00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:37.500 align:start position:0%
unemployment fraud you need to have
 
00:29:40.970 --> 00:29:40.980 align:start position:0%
acted willfully or intentionally with
 
00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
regard to the information you provided
 
00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:45.720 align:start position:0%
or didn't provide and that conduct needs
 
00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:48.980 align:start position:0%
to be targeted in order for you to have
 
00:29:51.889 --> 00:29:51.899 align:start position:0%
been provided benefits that you were not
 
00:29:51.899 --> 00:29:53.269 align:start position:0%
been provided benefits that you were not
eligible

00:29:53.269 --> 00:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
eligible
 
00:29:56.149 --> 00:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
so those efforts again are really
 
00:29:58.010 --> 00:29:58.020 align:start position:0%
focused on individuals that don't report
 
00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:01.260 align:start position:0%
their their work or their earnings uh
 
00:30:03.490 --> 00:30:03.500 align:start position:0%
that you know we receive
 
00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:08.700 align:start position:0%
a cross match between uh wage records
 
00:30:12.169 --> 00:30:12.179 align:start position:0%
new hires all of that gets cross-matched
 
00:30:14.269 --> 00:30:14.279 align:start position:0%
and compared against our benefit files
 
00:30:16.549 --> 00:30:16.559 align:start position:0%
and that's how we determine whom we're
 
00:30:19.130 --> 00:30:19.140 align:start position:0%
going to talk with when you get a call
 
00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:21.380 align:start position:0%
from a fraud investigator or not good
 
00:30:24.049 --> 00:30:24.059 align:start position:0%
so those are the individuals that fraud
 
00:30:26.389 --> 00:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
investig investigators are talking with
 
00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:28.380 align:start position:0%
to determine what occurred so it's
 
00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:31.320 align:start position:0%
intentional willful conduct that needs
 
00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
to be found after a process where we
 
00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
talk with that individual allow them the
 
00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to explain what happened and
 
00:30:45.889 --> 00:30:45.899 align:start position:0%
it's only after that that they would be
 
00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:49.320 align:start position:0%
found to be have committed fraud now the
 
00:30:51.529 --> 00:30:51.539 align:start position:0%
non-fraud situations again were largely
 
00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:55.320 align:start position:0%
out of the unreported earnings area and
 
00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
now you're with a situation where the
 
00:30:58.909 --> 00:30:58.919 align:start position:0%
person's either at fault or without
 
00:31:02.149 --> 00:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
fault in order to be at fault it needs
 
00:31:04.490 --> 00:31:04.500 align:start position:0%
to be determined that it's the
 
00:31:06.529 --> 00:31:06.539 align:start position:0%
information you provided that was
 
00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
inaccurate it was a something that you
 
00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
should have known was reasonable to know
 
00:31:15.549 --> 00:31:15.559 align:start position:0%
that was inaccurate or it was
 
00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:18.120 align:start position:0%
information that you did not provide
 
00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
that was material to your claim was
 
00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:23.340 align:start position:0%
reasonable to know that should have been
 
00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
provided so those are those are
 
00:31:27.889 --> 00:31:27.899 align:start position:0%
determinations that are made by
 
00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
adjudicators in the department that are
 
00:31:33.769 --> 00:31:33.779 align:start position:0%
trained on the unemployment statute and
 
00:31:36.289 --> 00:31:36.299 align:start position:0%
they make those determinations based on
 
00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:38.340 align:start position:0%
the fact find process that they have
 
00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
with the individual and with the
 
00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
employer before they issue those
 
00:31:44.269 --> 00:31:44.279 align:start position:0%
determinations all right thank you
 
00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:46.740 align:start position:0%
representative Schultz thank you Mr
 
00:31:50.090 --> 00:31:50.100 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking our questions
 
00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:51.769 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking our questions
um

00:31:51.769 --> 00:31:51.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
what you shared answered some of my
 
00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
questions but I the the implication from
 
00:32:00.769 --> 00:32:00.779 align:start position:0%
the bill is that
 
00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
um there are people that are continued
 
00:32:04.730 --> 00:32:04.740 align:start position:0%
to be I don't know what the term is
 
00:32:08.149 --> 00:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
build for overpayment the non-fraud
 
00:32:08.159 --> 00:32:10.010 align:start position:0%
build for overpayment the non-fraud
cases

00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:10.020 align:start position:0%
cases
 
00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:10.789 align:start position:0%
cases
um

00:32:10.789 --> 00:32:10.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:15.049 --> 00:32:15.059 align:start position:0%
for years possibly and I'm curious to
 
00:32:17.450 --> 00:32:17.460 align:start position:0%
know how many people
 
00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:19.010 align:start position:0%
know how many people
from

00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:19.020 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:23.460 align:start position:0%
2018 or how far back do you go to
 
00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
continue to charge for that and
 
00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:28.549 align:start position:0%
continue to charge for that and
um

00:32:28.549 --> 00:32:28.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:30.289 --> 00:32:30.299 align:start position:0%
do you have a sense of how many cases
 
00:32:32.210 --> 00:32:32.220 align:start position:0%
are still pending in that in that
 
00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:34.190 align:start position:0%
are still pending in that in that
category

00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:34.200 align:start position:0%
category
 
00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:35.820 align:start position:0%
um I I don't know that off the top of my
 
00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
head but I can get that for you
 
00:32:40.330 --> 00:32:40.340 align:start position:0%
representative and yes there there are
 
00:32:44.149 --> 00:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
individuals that are still carrying
 
00:32:46.850 --> 00:32:46.860 align:start position:0%
um overpayment debt dating back prior to
 
00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:49.740 align:start position:0%
the pandemic uh for which
 
00:32:51.889 --> 00:32:51.899 align:start position:0%
um some of them continue to make efforts
 
00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
to repay perhaps they're in a a payment
 
00:32:56.930 --> 00:32:56.940 align:start position:0%
agreement with the Department
 
00:32:59.870 --> 00:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
um and while the debt continues the
 
00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:01.980 align:start position:0%
interest continues to accrue but again
 
00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
those are individuals that were at fault
 
00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:07.260 align:start position:0%
in the in the creation of the of the
 
00:33:09.649 --> 00:33:09.659 align:start position:0%
overpayment they do have an opportunity
 
00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
at any point
 
00:33:13.549 --> 00:33:13.559 align:start position:0%
um if they feel their circumstances
 
00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:16.440 align:start position:0%
warranted or they can do it at the end
 
00:33:18.409 --> 00:33:18.419 align:start position:0%
of paying off the principal of their
 
00:33:21.529 --> 00:33:21.539 align:start position:0%
debt they can request a compromise from
 
00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:23.700 align:start position:0%
the Department which is requesting that
 
00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:25.860 align:start position:0%
the the balance of the debt be forgiven
 
00:33:28.549 --> 00:33:28.559 align:start position:0%
because of their their circumstances and
 
00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:30.120 align:start position:0%
the the standard that the department
 
00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:32.460 align:start position:0%
applies is what is considered to be in
 
00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:35.460 align:start position:0%
the best interest of the state so we
 
00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:37.980 align:start position:0%
regularly make individuals aware of that
 
00:33:40.610 --> 00:33:40.620 align:start position:0%
that was not the case
 
00:33:44.149 --> 00:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
um probably 10 years ago that was kind
 
00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:47.220 align:start position:0%
of a secret process that so secret yes
 
00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
it was in statute but not very wasn't
 
00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:51.960 align:start position:0%
communicated well to individuals we
 
00:33:54.169 --> 00:33:54.179 align:start position:0%
changed that so now in the
 
00:33:56.029 --> 00:33:56.039 align:start position:0%
determinations that individuals get
 
00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
they're told right on that determination
 
00:34:00.049 --> 00:34:00.059 align:start position:0%
of their opportunity to request a
 
00:34:02.269 --> 00:34:02.279 align:start position:0%
compromise but yes there are individuals
 
00:34:04.789 --> 00:34:04.799 align:start position:0%
that are are continuing to carry debt
 
00:34:08.570 --> 00:34:08.580 align:start position:0%
some of it non-fraud that they're either
 
00:34:11.690 --> 00:34:11.700 align:start position:0%
ignoring or maybe they're in an active
 
00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
payment agreement but we can get you
 
00:34:18.050 --> 00:34:18.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:20.820 align:start position:0%
okay now now fraud overpayments are we
 
00:34:23.210 --> 00:34:23.220 align:start position:0%
have the tools that we have to collect
 
00:34:26.389 --> 00:34:26.399 align:start position:0%
those are quite aggressive we don't have
 
00:34:29.389 --> 00:34:29.399 align:start position:0%
those same mechanisms for non-fraud
 
00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
overpayments but fraud overpayments we
 
00:34:34.490 --> 00:34:34.500 align:start position:0%
can offset your federal income tax
 
00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:37.800 align:start position:0%
refunds we can Levy your bank account we
 
00:34:39.829 --> 00:34:39.839 align:start position:0%
can record a real estate lien we can
 
00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
garnish your wages so we have some
 
00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:44.829 align:start position:0%
garnish your wages so we have some
aggressive

00:34:44.829 --> 00:34:44.839 align:start position:0%
aggressive
 
00:34:48.290 --> 00:34:48.300 align:start position:0%
mechanisms to encourage repayment of
 
00:34:51.589 --> 00:34:51.599 align:start position:0%
fraudulent overpayments we do not have
 
00:34:54.950 --> 00:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
those tools nor are we asking for them
 
00:34:58.430 --> 00:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
for non-fraud overpayments okay that's
 
00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
helpful to know and I you know
 
00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:03.060 align:start position:0%
I also think it's important to keep
 
00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:05.160 align:start position:0%
emphasizing this bill isn't for the
 
00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:08.640 align:start position:0%
fraud cases this is for the non-brun
 
00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
um and I would love to have a longer
 
00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
discussion at another point about the
 
00:35:19.970 --> 00:35:19.980 align:start position:0%
without fault cases where I imagine
 
00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:21.780 align:start position:0%
um your department your commission your
 
00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:25.260 align:start position:0%
department knows that people have
 
00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:27.720 align:start position:0%
not done anything wrong there's just a
 
00:35:29.390 --> 00:35:29.400 align:start position:0%
change in a determination or something
 
00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:32.220 align:start position:0%
and they should be automatically not
 
00:35:34.250 --> 00:35:34.260 align:start position:0%
included in that category I would hope
 
00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
but how far back do you have this do you
 
00:35:40.130 --> 00:35:40.140 align:start position:0%
have a number that you traditionally
 
00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
continue to bill for
 
00:35:46.069 --> 00:35:46.079 align:start position:0%
10 years five years and it would be
 
00:35:48.349 --> 00:35:48.359 align:start position:0%
helpful to know as we make a decision
 
00:35:53.410 --> 00:35:53.420 align:start position:0%
about this bill how much more than the
 
00:35:56.750 --> 00:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
2022 number how much are we talking
 
00:35:58.609 --> 00:35:58.619 align:start position:0%
about in interest I think it would be
 
00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
helpful to know and how far back do you
 
00:36:04.069 --> 00:36:04.079 align:start position:0%
continue to Bill
 
00:36:06.829 --> 00:36:06.839 align:start position:0%
um so statute of limitations on the
 
00:36:10.069 --> 00:36:10.079 align:start position:0%
types of overpayments so for non-fraud
 
00:36:14.569 --> 00:36:14.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
um has two years from the impacted weeks
 
00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:19.560 align:start position:0%
to issue a determination finding you
 
00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:22.970 align:start position:0%
to issue a determination finding you
overpaid

00:36:22.970 --> 00:36:22.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
sorry about that
 
00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
um so two years for for finding someone
 
00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
overpaid in a non-fraud situation for
 
00:36:32.349 --> 00:36:32.359 align:start position:0%
fraud we have six years
 
00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
then upon the determination meeting that
 
00:36:39.050 --> 00:36:39.060 align:start position:0%
statute of limitations there for a
 
00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:41.880 align:start position:0%
non-fraud situation we then have six
 
00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:43.800 align:start position:0%
years in order to seek further
 
00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
enforcement of that through filing a
 
00:36:49.849 --> 00:36:49.859 align:start position:0%
writ in circuit court and seeking to
 
00:36:52.990 --> 00:36:53.000 align:start position:0%
enforce that through a court order
 
00:36:55.849 --> 00:36:55.859 align:start position:0%
that is not something regularly done
 
00:36:58.250 --> 00:36:58.260 align:start position:0%
with non-fraud but it is something that
 
00:37:01.609 --> 00:37:01.619 align:start position:0%
is done with fraud so those are some of
 
00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:03.480 align:start position:0%
the statute of limitations that we have
 
00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:06.660 align:start position:0%
in order to to comply with we also have
 
00:37:09.829 --> 00:37:09.839 align:start position:0%
to obviously deal with bankruptcy orders
 
00:37:12.890 --> 00:37:12.900 align:start position:0%
other things of that nature but to get
 
00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
at your earlier Point representative if
 
00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:17.940 align:start position:0%
it is a situation where you were put in
 
00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
the wrong program
 
00:37:24.109 --> 00:37:24.119 align:start position:0%
or just paid benefits maybe we screwed
 
00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:26.640 align:start position:0%
up and we assigned wages to your base
 
00:37:29.810 --> 00:37:29.820 align:start position:0%
period that were not yours
 
00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:32.640 align:start position:0%
and you're you receive benefits and that
 
00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:36.060 align:start position:0%
we later catch our error you will not
 
00:37:38.690 --> 00:37:38.700 align:start position:0%
have to repay those benefits okay you
 
00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
are without fault in doing that the
 
00:37:43.250 --> 00:37:43.260 align:start position:0%
department screwed up we say it not
 
00:37:45.589 --> 00:37:45.599 align:start position:0%
using those words but the department
 
00:37:49.069 --> 00:37:49.079 align:start position:0%
made an error you are not found overpaid
 
00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:51.420 align:start position:0%
you're not found to have to repay those
 
00:37:53.569 --> 00:37:53.579 align:start position:0%
and it's not a situation that we're
 
00:37:55.310 --> 00:37:55.320 align:start position:0%
dealing with here it's only those that
 
00:37:58.130 --> 00:37:58.140 align:start position:0%
you provided us information that we
 
00:38:00.290 --> 00:38:00.300 align:start position:0%
don't feel Rises to the level of of
 
00:38:02.450 --> 00:38:02.460 align:start position:0%
needing to pursue a fraud investigation
 
00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
but it's information that it was
 
00:38:08.270 --> 00:38:08.280 align:start position:0%
reasonable to know was inaccurate either
 
00:38:10.310 --> 00:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
about your separation or your work
 
00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
search and then you're found to be
 
00:38:14.089 --> 00:38:14.099 align:start position:0%
overpaid in those situations the
 
00:38:16.130 --> 00:38:16.140 align:start position:0%
individual has to repay that and right
 
00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
now a cruise interest after they exhaust
 
00:38:21.530 --> 00:38:21.540 align:start position:0%
their appeals and after the 60 days from
 
00:38:27.589 --> 00:38:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
next question uh representative Granger
 
00:38:33.770 --> 00:38:33.780 align:start position:0%
uh thank you so I have a handful of
 
00:38:35.390 --> 00:38:35.400 align:start position:0%
questions if you don't mind
 
00:38:36.829 --> 00:38:36.839 align:start position:0%
um so the first one that might be
 
00:38:39.530 --> 00:38:39.540 align:start position:0%
answered the other ones do you happen to
 
00:38:42.530 --> 00:38:42.540 align:start position:0%
know where in 282a it gives the
 
00:38:44.930 --> 00:38:44.940 align:start position:0%
department authority to charge interest
 
00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
uh yeah it's throughout 282a I don't
 
00:38:52.609 --> 00:38:52.619 align:start position:0%
have the site off the top of my head but
 
00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
I'll get you that section
 
00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:54.829 align:start position:0%
I'll get you that section
um

00:38:54.829 --> 00:38:54.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:58.190 --> 00:38:58.200 align:start position:0%
Marie Helene ballinson might have that
 
00:39:02.329 --> 00:39:02.339 align:start position:0%
so 282a section 165 is what I'm being
 
00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
told I don't think well I read once it's
 
00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:14.280 align:start position:0%
okay okay um I'll just ask the next is
 
00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
it okay to follow up
 
00:39:18.349 --> 00:39:18.359 align:start position:0%
um but we have we have statutory
 
00:39:19.970 --> 00:39:19.980 align:start position:0%
Authority and an obligation to charge
 
00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:24.720 align:start position:0%
interest on on overpaid on
 
00:39:27.730 --> 00:39:27.740 align:start position:0%
fraud and non-fraud claimant fault
 
00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:29.880 align:start position:0%
overpayments as well as unpaid
 
00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
unemployment taxes so it's a it's the
 
00:39:34.609 --> 00:39:34.619 align:start position:0%
same consistent one percent in both
 
00:39:37.849 --> 00:39:37.859 align:start position:0%
situations okay
 
00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
uh so 141 and then that's in our the tax
 
00:39:44.329 --> 00:39:44.339 align:start position:0%
section of our statute and then there's
 
00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
a provision in the overpayment or
 
00:39:50.210 --> 00:39:50.220 align:start position:0%
benefits section of the statute that
 
00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:52.200 align:start position:0%
references back to saying we have the
 
00:39:55.130 --> 00:39:55.140 align:start position:0%
authority described in 141.
 
00:39:57.710 --> 00:39:57.720 align:start position:0%
perfect I believe is how it's structured
 
00:39:57.720 --> 00:39:58.970 align:start position:0%
perfect I believe is how it's structured
okay

00:39:58.970 --> 00:39:58.980 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:40:01.609 --> 00:40:01.619 align:start position:0%
um for a follow-up uh
 
00:40:03.770 --> 00:40:03.780 align:start position:0%
two questions how is the interest rate
 
00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
set and how much Liberty does the
 
00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner have in with regard to how
 
00:40:09.770 --> 00:40:09.780 align:start position:0%
much interest is charged is that set in
 
00:40:12.589 --> 00:40:12.599 align:start position:0%
statute or is that yeah so statutes set
 
00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
at one percent per month there's no
 
00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:15.950 align:start position:0%
at one percent per month there's no
discretion

00:40:15.950 --> 00:40:15.960 align:start position:0%
discretion
 
00:40:17.870 --> 00:40:17.880 align:start position:0%
um in terms of
 
00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:18.770 align:start position:0%
um in terms of
um

00:40:18.770 --> 00:40:18.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:21.890 --> 00:40:21.900 align:start position:0%
um charging um more or less interest
 
00:40:24.589 --> 00:40:24.599 align:start position:0%
that's one percent per month per statute
 
00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
so no discretion on the part of the
 
00:40:28.849 --> 00:40:28.859 align:start position:0%
department the only discretion that the
 
00:40:31.609 --> 00:40:31.619 align:start position:0%
department does have is someone who
 
00:40:34.250 --> 00:40:34.260 align:start position:0%
comes in and and files a request for
 
00:40:37.370 --> 00:40:37.380 align:start position:0%
compromise as I talked about before that
 
00:40:39.410 --> 00:40:39.420 align:start position:0%
standard that set by Statute and there
 
00:40:41.690 --> 00:40:41.700 align:start position:0%
are administrative rules on that where
 
00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
it's a best interest of the state
 
00:40:47.170 --> 00:40:47.180 align:start position:0%
standard and so someone could come in
 
00:40:50.810 --> 00:40:50.820 align:start position:0%
and explain why their their
 
00:40:54.170 --> 00:40:54.180 align:start position:0%
circumstances warrant forgiveness of a
 
00:40:56.089 --> 00:40:56.099 align:start position:0%
debt it doesn't allow us to change the
 
00:40:57.589 --> 00:40:57.599 align:start position:0%
interest that they're that they're
 
00:40:59.270 --> 00:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
they're being charged if it's applicable
 
00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
to their debt but they can get
 
00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
forgiveness of the debt
 
00:41:04.370 --> 00:41:04.380 align:start position:0%
okay thank you that's all I have
 
00:41:07.370 --> 00:41:07.380 align:start position:0%
representative Valvoline
 
00:41:08.930 --> 00:41:08.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:41:10.730 --> 00:41:10.740 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner for being here with
 
00:41:12.109 --> 00:41:12.119 align:start position:0%
us today
 
00:41:13.790 --> 00:41:13.800 align:start position:0%
um the I just want to reference to the
 
00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
2.7 million dollars from last year uh
 
00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
1.2 is in recovery 1.5 is that charge to
 
00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:21.470 align:start position:0%
1.2 is in recovery 1.5 is that charge to
the

00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:21.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:41:25.490 --> 00:41:25.500 align:start position:0%
fund for that loss correct those are uh
 
00:41:28.490 --> 00:41:28.500 align:start position:0%
State unemployment benefit payments uh
 
00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
that would have come out of the trust
 
00:41:32.089 --> 00:41:32.099 align:start position:0%
fund and when they
 
00:41:35.329 --> 00:41:35.339 align:start position:0%
um when they are repaid those payments
 
00:41:37.609 --> 00:41:37.619 align:start position:0%
the principal portion of it goes back
 
00:41:39.829 --> 00:41:39.839 align:start position:0%
into the trust fund
 
00:41:39.839 --> 00:41:41.329 align:start position:0%
into the trust fund
hello

00:41:41.329 --> 00:41:41.339 align:start position:0%
hello
 
00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:43.260 align:start position:0%
um so the other part that is not
 
00:41:45.530 --> 00:41:45.540 align:start position:0%
collected whether it be administratively
 
00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:48.420 align:start position:0%
or Not by egregious
 
00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:51.720 align:start position:0%
um is that cost passed on to the
 
00:41:55.490 --> 00:41:55.500 align:start position:0%
business owners if the in terms of the
 
00:41:57.530 --> 00:41:57.540 align:start position:0%
impact on their tax rate so I guess
 
00:41:59.450 --> 00:41:59.460 align:start position:0%
there there are two answers to this
 
00:42:02.510 --> 00:42:02.520 align:start position:0%
question on the tax rate side no there's
 
00:42:05.450 --> 00:42:05.460 align:start position:0%
there's not an impact so if if the
 
00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
individual is determined to be at fault
 
00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
that does not is not a charge against
 
00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:13.140 align:start position:0%
your experience that then influences
 
00:42:14.810 --> 00:42:14.820 align:start position:0%
your tax rate
 
00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:16.310 align:start position:0%
your tax rate
however

00:42:16.310 --> 00:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:19.380 align:start position:0%
there are also reductions to your tax
 
00:42:21.710 --> 00:42:21.720 align:start position:0%
rate that are triggered by the balance
 
00:42:23.930 --> 00:42:23.940 align:start position:0%
of the trust fund right so all of our
 
00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
solvency controls for New Hampshire's
 
00:42:27.650 --> 00:42:27.660 align:start position:0%
trust fund are contained within statute
 
00:42:29.930 --> 00:42:29.940 align:start position:0%
and are based on the balance in the
 
00:42:33.650 --> 00:42:33.660 align:start position:0%
trust fund so perhaps if the trust fund
 
00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:35.640 align:start position:0%
did not meet one of those Balance
 
00:42:38.290 --> 00:42:38.300 align:start position:0%
thresholds and it was really close call
 
00:42:40.990 --> 00:42:41.000 align:start position:0%
that could have an impact where
 
00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
Employers in general not a particular
 
00:42:45.770 --> 00:42:45.780 align:start position:0%
employer but Employers in general would
 
00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
not receive that fund balance reduction
 
00:42:50.270 --> 00:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
as it's referenced in statute
 
00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you and for the last one
 
00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
all the administrative costs to recover
 
00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
all these funds is that charge to the
 
00:42:57.829 --> 00:42:57.839 align:start position:0%
fund or is that charge to the
 
00:42:59.870 --> 00:42:59.880 align:start position:0%
administrative portion it's charged to
 
00:43:01.730 --> 00:43:01.740 align:start position:0%
the administrative portion but it's paid
 
00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:04.440 align:start position:0%
for by employers so
 
00:43:08.809 --> 00:43:08.819 align:start position:0%
um we we receive uh about 51 percent of
 
00:43:11.210 --> 00:43:11.220 align:start position:0%
our budget is in the form of different
 
00:43:13.970 --> 00:43:13.980 align:start position:0%
federal grants for the unemployment
 
00:43:16.490 --> 00:43:16.500 align:start position:0%
program re-employment Services labor
 
00:43:18.530 --> 00:43:18.540 align:start position:0%
market information and then the balance
 
00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
of that is paid for out of the
 
00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
administrative fund that is paid for
 
00:43:24.829 --> 00:43:24.839 align:start position:0%
quarterly by employers they have a
 
00:43:26.930 --> 00:43:26.940 align:start position:0%
portion of their their tax payment that
 
00:43:29.150 --> 00:43:29.160 align:start position:0%
gets diverted from the trust fund to
 
00:43:31.609 --> 00:43:31.619 align:start position:0%
support the administration of the
 
00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
program and so the administrative costs
 
00:43:39.050 --> 00:43:39.060 align:start position:0%
in pursuing collection are absorbed by
 
00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:41.400 align:start position:0%
those administrative payments thank you
 
00:43:46.970 --> 00:43:46.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:49.069 --> 00:43:49.079 align:start position:0%
ah representative Cahill
 
00:43:50.930 --> 00:43:50.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr
 
00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:53.160 align:start position:0%
wavers I believe I just heard you say
 
00:43:56.210 --> 00:43:56.220 align:start position:0%
that the uh the you didn't mention where
 
00:43:58.309 --> 00:43:58.319 align:start position:0%
the interest goes if you when they are
 
00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
paid as the interest go uh towards or
 
00:44:04.130 --> 00:44:04.140 align:start position:0%
the uh fund or elsewhere uh the the
 
00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
interest gets deposited in the
 
00:44:07.849 --> 00:44:07.859 align:start position:0%
administrative fund
 
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
so in in 20 I think it was in the fiscal
 
00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
note but let me just make sure it's
 
00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:16.490 align:start position:0%
note but let me just make sure it's
correct

00:44:16.490 --> 00:44:16.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:19.130 --> 00:44:19.140 align:start position:0%
so fiscal year 22 not calendar but
 
00:44:21.410 --> 00:44:21.420 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 22 uh the department
 
00:44:24.170 --> 00:44:24.180 align:start position:0%
collected just over ninety one thousand
 
00:44:26.809 --> 00:44:26.819 align:start position:0%
dollars in interest from non-fraud
 
00:44:29.569 --> 00:44:29.579 align:start position:0%
overpaid benefits and that went into the
 
00:44:32.210 --> 00:44:32.220 align:start position:0%
administrative fund which helps my
 
00:44:34.730 --> 00:44:34.740 align:start position:0%
friend Mr avalani and others who would
 
00:44:37.010 --> 00:44:37.020 align:start position:0%
contribute to that fund correct
 
00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
very good and to be clear uh this this
 
00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
this law that we passed this bill this
 
00:44:46.069 --> 00:44:46.079 align:start position:0%
will only reduce the burden on people
 
00:44:48.290 --> 00:44:48.300 align:start position:0%
who did not make an intentional effort
 
00:44:50.089 --> 00:44:50.099 align:start position:0%
but had an honest mistake something
 
00:44:53.950 --> 00:44:53.960 align:start position:0%
happened and uh they uh they still repay
 
00:44:57.050 --> 00:44:57.060 align:start position:0%
the the amounts they received just not
 
00:44:58.910 --> 00:44:58.920 align:start position:0%
the interest
 
00:45:01.970 --> 00:45:01.980 align:start position:0%
correct so this bill so it individuals
 
00:45:05.270 --> 00:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
that are that are with fault in creating
 
00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
the overpaid benefits
 
00:45:09.109 --> 00:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
um they would still have an overpayment
 
00:45:10.730 --> 00:45:10.740 align:start position:0%
they'd still have to repay that
 
00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:13.020 align:start position:0%
principal amount but if the bill were to
 
00:45:15.170 --> 00:45:15.180 align:start position:0%
pass there wouldn't be interest accruing
 
00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:21.890 --> 00:45:21.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:24.650 --> 00:45:24.660 align:start position:0%
I don't see any this was the last card
 
00:45:26.569 --> 00:45:26.579 align:start position:0%
representative Broody if you could pass
 
00:45:30.589 --> 00:45:30.599 align:start position:0%
the blue sheet up for this bill
 
00:45:35.089 --> 00:45:35.099 align:start position:0%
um thank you and online right now we
 
00:45:40.309 --> 00:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
have signed in for support 31 names 5 in

00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:03.589 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:46:03.589 --> 00:46:03.599 align:start position:0%

Don McKinney who testified

Hampshire I do hail from West Lebanon
 
00:47:27.530 --> 00:47:27.540 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so I'm here today to
 
00:47:29.870 --> 00:47:29.880 align:start position:0%
introduce Senate Bill 193 this is a
 
00:47:33.950 --> 00:47:33.960 align:start position:0%
bipartisan effort it will amend RSA 373
 
00:47:36.589 --> 00:47:36.599 align:start position:0%
A3 the obligation to bargain in good
 
00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
faith the purpose of this amendment is
 
00:47:40.250 --> 00:47:40.260 align:start position:0%
to provide a tool by which a bargaining
 
00:47:42.349 --> 00:47:42.359 align:start position:0%
unit and a public employer will initiate
 
00:47:45.290 --> 00:47:45.300 align:start position:0%
a timeline to begin and to work within
 
00:47:48.410 --> 00:47:48.420 align:start position:0%
once a request has been made to bargain
 
00:47:50.750 --> 00:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
and I trust you already know that
 
00:47:52.190 --> 00:47:52.200 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining is a process
 
00:47:54.650 --> 00:47:54.660 align:start position:0%
through which the union and the employer
 
00:47:56.750 --> 00:47:56.760 align:start position:0%
exchange proposals share ideas mutually
 
00:47:59.329 --> 00:47:59.339 align:start position:0%
solve problems and reach a written
 
00:47:59.339 --> 00:48:00.470 align:start position:0%
solve problems and reach a written
agreement

00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
00:48:03.050 --> 00:48:03.060 align:start position:0%
most times bargaining occurs when an
 
00:48:05.930 --> 00:48:05.940 align:start position:0%
existing contract is going to expire in
 
00:48:08.089 --> 00:48:08.099 align:start position:0%
order to ensure timely negotiations and
 
00:48:10.670 --> 00:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
a settlement of the issues time is of
 
00:48:13.069 --> 00:48:13.079 align:start position:0%
the essence if a request to enter into
 
00:48:15.230 --> 00:48:15.240 align:start position:0%
bargaining occurs and is not responded
 
00:48:18.290 --> 00:48:18.300 align:start position:0%
to again in a timely manner the process
 
00:48:21.290 --> 00:48:21.300 align:start position:0%
can be unnecessarily prolonged with this
 
00:48:23.569 --> 00:48:23.579 align:start position:0%
prolongment comes unintended
 
00:48:25.790 --> 00:48:25.800 align:start position:0%
consequences you have a budget that's
 
00:48:28.609 --> 00:48:28.619 align:start position:0%
waiting to be informed as a result of
 
00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
this you have
 
00:48:32.109 --> 00:48:32.119 align:start position:0%
benefits that need to be implemented
 
00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
adjusting of pay adjusting of tax rates
 
00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
there are just a number of consequences
 
00:48:38.809 --> 00:48:38.819 align:start position:0%
that can happen down the line the longer
 
00:48:43.010 --> 00:48:43.020 align:start position:0%
that this goes on so what 193 does is it
 
00:48:45.290 --> 00:48:45.300 align:start position:0%
makes a request to enter in two
 
00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
negotiations within 10 days of the
 
00:48:51.290 --> 00:48:51.300 align:start position:0%
request or by mutual agreement to extend
 
00:48:53.809 --> 00:48:53.819 align:start position:0%
that 10-day window so if a request is
 
00:48:55.670 --> 00:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
made and it can't be responded to right
 
00:48:58.490 --> 00:48:58.500 align:start position:0%
away then the employer would come back
 
00:49:00.829 --> 00:49:00.839 align:start position:0%
and say I can't do this Within These 10
 
00:49:03.650 --> 00:49:03.660 align:start position:0%
days can we mutually agree on a timeline
 
00:49:06.589 --> 00:49:06.599 align:start position:0%
this is a Communications tool again it
 
00:49:10.190 --> 00:49:10.200 align:start position:0%
sets X it sets expectations and it opens
 
00:49:12.670 --> 00:49:12.680 align:start position:0%
what is a crucial line of Communications
 
00:49:16.609 --> 00:49:16.619 align:start position:0%
in this process so with that I thank you
 
00:49:18.650 --> 00:49:18.660 align:start position:0%
for your time and consideration
 
00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
I will make my best attempt to answer
 
00:49:22.910 --> 00:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
any questions you have I have some folks
 
00:49:25.849 --> 00:49:25.859 align:start position:0%

includes the Maine state employees
Association

00:51:56.470 --> 00:51:56.480 align:start position:0%
Association
 
00:51:59.150 --> 00:51:59.160 align:start position:0%
the main Education Association and the
 
00:52:01.370 --> 00:52:01.380 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Education Association
 
00:52:02.990 --> 00:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
I currently serve as the uniserv
 
00:52:04.549 --> 00:52:04.559 align:start position:0%
director for the Seacoast region in New
 
00:52:06.470 --> 00:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with the New Hampshire
 
00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:08.520 align:start position:0%

teaching and support staff in the

schools in the Seacoast region over the
 
00:52:15.109 --> 00:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
course of my tenure as a staff member
 
00:52:16.910 --> 00:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining for employees has
 
00:52:18.589 --> 00:52:18.599 align:start position:0%
been a core function of the work I do on
 
00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
behalf of members of unions while
 
00:52:23.390 --> 00:52:23.400 align:start position:0%
negotiations can be tens of times on
 
00:52:25.130 --> 00:52:25.140 align:start position:0%
both parties both parties do tend to
 
00:52:26.569 --> 00:52:26.579 align:start position:0%
work together very hard to be
 
00:52:28.250 --> 00:52:28.260 align:start position:0%
professional and Define common ground as
 
00:52:29.930 --> 00:52:29.940 align:start position:0%
efficiently as possible
 
00:52:31.730 --> 00:52:31.740 align:start position:0%
in order to make this happen the parties
 
00:52:34.069 --> 00:52:34.079 align:start position:0%
have to be open flexible and timely with
 
00:52:35.930 --> 00:52:35.940 align:start position:0%
scheduling negotiations
 
00:52:38.510 --> 00:52:38.520 align:start position:0%
both parties must recognize the existing
 
00:52:40.309 --> 00:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
timeline to get a new contract in place
 
00:52:42.109 --> 00:52:42.119 align:start position:0%
and work collaboratively to schedule
 
00:52:45.290 --> 00:52:45.300 align:start position:0%
meetings however there are occasions one
 
00:52:46.910 --> 00:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
has been incredibly challenging for
 
00:52:48.650 --> 00:52:48.660 align:start position:0%
associations to bring board teams to the
 
00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
table to negotiate in a timely fashion
 
00:52:52.549 --> 00:52:52.559 align:start position:0%
when this happens it undermines the
 
00:52:54.290 --> 00:52:54.300 align:start position:0%
mutual obligations of the parties and
 
00:52:56.990 --> 00:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
frustrates the entire bargaining process
 
00:52:59.150 --> 00:52:59.160 align:start position:0%
in Maine this was recognized and a
 
00:53:00.950 --> 00:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
process was codified into law to provide
 
00:53:04.069 --> 00:53:04.079 align:start position:0%
a tool to the parties to overcome any
 
00:53:06.410 --> 00:53:06.420 align:start position:0%
intentional or unintentional delays of
 
00:53:07.849 --> 00:53:07.859 align:start position:0%
the collecting collective bargaining
 
00:53:09.950 --> 00:53:09.960 align:start position:0%
process after the initial demand to
 
00:53:11.569 --> 00:53:11.579 align:start position:0%
bargain had been issued
 
00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
under Public Employee labor law
 
00:53:18.349 --> 00:53:18.359 align:start position:0%
relations 26 MRSA section 965 1B
 
00:53:20.569 --> 00:53:20.579 align:start position:0%
either party in the process is able to
 
00:53:22.430 --> 00:53:22.440 align:start position:0%
issue a 10-day demand to bargain upon
 
00:53:23.630 --> 00:53:23.640 align:start position:0%
the other party
 
00:53:25.730 --> 00:53:25.740 align:start position:0%
once the demand has been issued within
 
00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
10 days
 
00:53:28.730 --> 00:53:28.740 align:start position:0%
after receipt of the written notice from
 
00:53:30.290 --> 00:53:30.300 align:start position:0%
the other party the party receiving the
 
00:53:32.030 --> 00:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
notice must meet with the party issuing
 
00:53:33.349 --> 00:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
the notice for the purpose of bargaining
 
00:53:35.210 --> 00:53:35.220 align:start position:0%
and as you heard a little bit earlier
 
00:53:37.549 --> 00:53:37.559 align:start position:0%
Extensions by mutual agreement can be
 
00:53:39.770 --> 00:53:39.780 align:start position:0%
granted this tool ensures the parties
 
00:53:41.630 --> 00:53:41.640 align:start position:0%
continue to negotiate in good faith
 
00:53:44.390 --> 00:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
during negotiations it is important to
 
00:53:46.490 --> 00:53:46.500 align:start position:0%
note that Maine does not have the strict
 
00:53:49.250 --> 00:53:49.260 align:start position:0%
timelines that we have here to ratify a
 
00:53:50.870 --> 00:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
contract in New Hampshire
 
00:53:53.569 --> 00:53:53.579 align:start position:0%
yet they still saw the wisdom in
 
00:53:55.309 --> 00:53:55.319 align:start position:0%
providing this additional tool to the
 
00:53:58.549 --> 00:53:58.559 align:start position:0%
parties in order to maintain uh the
 
00:54:00.109 --> 00:54:00.119 align:start position:0%
obligations of both the top parties to
 
00:54:02.210 --> 00:54:02.220 align:start position:0%
be efficient with the timeline
 
00:54:04.190 --> 00:54:04.200 align:start position:0%
they saw the value in preventing
 
00:54:06.170 --> 00:54:06.180 align:start position:0%
existing contracts from becoming expired
 
00:54:08.270 --> 00:54:08.280 align:start position:0%
before new contract to be put in place
 
00:54:10.609 --> 00:54:10.619 align:start position:0%
they also saw the value in preventing
 
00:54:12.230 --> 00:54:12.240 align:start position:0%
further deliberations between the
 
00:54:14.210 --> 00:54:14.220 align:start position:0%
parties regarding retroactivity of wages
 
00:54:16.490 --> 00:54:16.500 align:start position:0%
and benefits related to the expiration
 
00:54:18.770 --> 00:54:18.780 align:start position:0%
of a contract it was recognized that
 
00:54:20.510 --> 00:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
these scenarios cause unrest with the
 
00:54:22.250 --> 00:54:22.260 align:start position:0%
workforce and that it strains Labor
 
00:54:24.950 --> 00:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
Management relations main lawmakers saw
 
00:54:26.329 --> 00:54:26.339 align:start position:0%
the wisdom in preventing this and
 
00:54:28.190 --> 00:54:28.200 align:start position:0%
reinforcing the mutual obligations to
 
00:54:30.589 --> 00:54:30.599 align:start position:0%
meet at reasonable times by providing
 
00:54:32.089 --> 00:54:32.099 align:start position:0%
this tool
 
00:54:33.470 --> 00:54:33.480 align:start position:0%
I was with the Maine Education
 
00:54:35.089 --> 00:54:35.099 align:start position:0%
Association for a little over four years
 
00:54:37.309 --> 00:54:37.319 align:start position:0%
I had this tool available to me and I
 
00:54:39.710 --> 00:54:39.720 align:start position:0%
only had to use it roughly three times
 
00:54:41.809 --> 00:54:41.819 align:start position:0%
related to refusals to me in a timely
 
00:54:41.819 --> 00:54:43.010 align:start position:0%
related to refusals to me in a timely
fashion

00:54:43.010 --> 00:54:43.020 align:start position:0%
fashion
 
00:54:44.930 --> 00:54:44.940 align:start position:0%
this was when weeks had gone by and
 
00:54:46.609 --> 00:54:46.619 align:start position:0%
every day the association offered was
 
00:54:48.410 --> 00:54:48.420 align:start position:0%
rejected and no dates were provided to
 
00:54:50.809 --> 00:54:50.819 align:start position:0%
us in the alternative when contracts are
 
00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
approaching exploration and labor was
 
00:54:55.609 --> 00:54:55.619 align:start position:0%
becoming increasingly distressed and we
 
00:54:57.530 --> 00:54:57.540 align:start position:0%
had failed yet to reach an agreement in
 
00:54:59.450 --> 00:54:59.460 align:start position:0%
those instances this tool was invaluable
 
00:55:03.049 --> 00:55:03.059 align:start position:0%
and allowed us to request the team to to
 
00:55:05.710 --> 00:55:05.720 align:start position:0%
meet with us to continue negotiations
 
00:55:08.210 --> 00:55:08.220 align:start position:0%
without this tool the contracts in those
 
00:55:09.950 --> 00:55:09.960 align:start position:0%
places would have expired while we were
 
00:55:11.270 --> 00:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
still waiting for the other party to
 
00:55:13.670 --> 00:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
agree to dates to meet using this tool
 
00:55:15.230 --> 00:55:15.240 align:start position:0%
three times Over a four-year period
 
00:55:18.049 --> 00:55:18.059 align:start position:0%
isn't what I would call excessive
 
00:55:20.210 --> 00:55:20.220 align:start position:0%
or frequent by any means but it was
 
00:55:21.890 --> 00:55:21.900 align:start position:0%
available when we truly needed it to
 
00:55:23.210 --> 00:55:23.220 align:start position:0%
make the difference for the workers in
 
00:55:24.829 --> 00:55:24.839 align:start position:0%
those Public Schools
 
00:55:26.809 --> 00:55:26.819 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire as you know we have a
 
00:55:28.670 --> 00:55:28.680 align:start position:0%
multi-layered process to pass contracts
 
00:55:30.410 --> 00:55:30.420 align:start position:0%
once agreements have been reached they
 
00:55:32.569 --> 00:55:32.579 align:start position:0%
must be ratified by the Association by
 
00:55:34.609 --> 00:55:34.619 align:start position:0%
the district and then by the town
 
00:55:36.890 --> 00:55:36.900 align:start position:0%
so that so time must be built in
 
00:55:38.630 --> 00:55:38.640 align:start position:0%
planning well in advance of negotiations
 
00:55:40.849 --> 00:55:40.859 align:start position:0%
actually happening
 
00:55:42.829 --> 00:55:42.839 align:start position:0%
further we don't have true Evergreens in
 
00:55:44.510 --> 00:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so wages freeze if we
 
00:55:46.069 --> 00:55:46.079 align:start position:0%
expire without any guarantee of
 
00:55:47.930 --> 00:55:47.940 align:start position:0%
retroactivity and we have strict
 
00:55:49.790 --> 00:55:49.800 align:start position:0%
timelines for our sb2 school districts
 
00:55:51.470 --> 00:55:51.480 align:start position:0%
to be ready for the last stage of
 
00:55:53.270 --> 00:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
ratification with the community so
 
00:55:54.950 --> 00:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
pressure is mounting long before even
 
00:55:57.230 --> 00:55:57.240 align:start position:0%
the initial demand is issued from the
 
00:55:57.240 --> 00:55:58.549 align:start position:0%
the initial demand is issued from the
association

00:55:58.549 --> 00:55:58.559 align:start position:0%
association
 
00:56:00.770 --> 00:56:00.780 align:start position:0%
our guidelines say that sb2 school
 
00:56:02.270 --> 00:56:02.280 align:start position:0%
districts we must issue our initial
 
00:56:04.549 --> 00:56:04.559 align:start position:0%
demand at least 120 days before the
 
00:56:06.890 --> 00:56:06.900 align:start position:0%
contracts expire and we also need to
 
00:56:08.390 --> 00:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
keep an eye on the second week of
 
00:56:11.329 --> 00:56:11.339 align:start position:0%
November to know roughly by November
 
00:56:12.770 --> 00:56:12.780 align:start position:0%
14th if we're going to be able to reach
 
00:56:14.390 --> 00:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
a final contract or if we're going to be
 
00:56:16.010 --> 00:56:16.020 align:start position:0%
an impasse and need to look at advanced
 
00:56:16.020 --> 00:56:17.150 align:start position:0%
an impasse and need to look at advanced
process

00:56:17.150 --> 00:56:17.160 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:56:19.069 --> 00:56:19.079 align:start position:0%
if we aren't close enough to settling a
 
00:56:20.690 --> 00:56:20.700 align:start position:0%
contract by the second week of November
 
00:56:23.270 --> 00:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
and we don't call impasse we simply
 
00:56:25.190 --> 00:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
won't have enough time for mediation and
 
00:56:27.890 --> 00:56:27.900 align:start position:0%
or to reconvene to finalize a contract
 
00:56:29.809 --> 00:56:29.819 align:start position:0%
this means employees will be at status
 
00:56:32.210 --> 00:56:32.220 align:start position:0%
quo and no new contract will be issued
 
00:56:34.910 --> 00:56:34.920 align:start position:0%
no wage increases will be provided and
 
00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
no potential will be provided for
 
00:56:38.450 --> 00:56:38.460 align:start position:0%
improvement in any benefits
 
00:56:40.309 --> 00:56:40.319 align:start position:0%
being mindful of this our demands to
 
00:56:41.750 --> 00:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
bargain for contracts due to be
 
00:56:44.750 --> 00:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
negotiated are issued at least in August
 
00:56:46.250 --> 00:56:46.260 align:start position:0%
and we have roughly three and a half
 
00:56:48.290 --> 00:56:48.300 align:start position:0%
months to get and get contracts in place
 
00:56:49.849 --> 00:56:49.859 align:start position:0%
where we can say confidently whether we
 
00:56:51.230 --> 00:56:51.240 align:start position:0%
will or will not have a contract ready
 
00:56:53.690 --> 00:56:53.700 align:start position:0%
to be ratified by the parties
 
00:56:55.069 --> 00:56:55.079 align:start position:0%
every day we wait to start the
 
00:56:56.870 --> 00:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
bargaining process as a day lost in that
 
00:56:58.849 --> 00:56:58.859 align:start position:0%
window and we have no time to waste
 
00:57:01.670 --> 00:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
budgets as you know in late November and
 
00:57:03.109 --> 00:57:03.119 align:start position:0%
early December
 
00:57:04.970 --> 00:57:04.980 align:start position:0%
in Seacoast I'm responsible for
 
00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
assisting teacher and support staff
 
00:57:07.670 --> 00:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
locals to negotiate their collective
 
00:57:09.950 --> 00:57:09.960 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreements over the last four
 
00:57:12.109 --> 00:57:12.119 align:start position:0%
years I've negotiated anywhere between 7
 
00:57:14.030 --> 00:57:14.040 align:start position:0%
and 16 collective bargaining agreements
 
00:57:16.190 --> 00:57:16.200 align:start position:0%
each negotiation cycle
 
00:57:18.230 --> 00:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
during the current negotiation cycle I
 
00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
had 11 contracts to negotiate and
 
00:57:22.790 --> 00:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
getting a good place by November I can
 
00:57:23.990 --> 00:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
tell you with no reservation that
 
00:57:25.670 --> 00:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
despite issuing demands to bargain in
 
00:57:28.250 --> 00:57:28.260 align:start position:0%
August every year or earlier it is
 
00:57:30.170 --> 00:57:30.180 align:start position:0%
extremely rare that any school board is
 
00:57:32.510 --> 00:57:32.520 align:start position:0%
ready and or willing to reconvene or to
 
00:57:34.430 --> 00:57:34.440 align:start position:0%
convene with us in August or over the
 
00:57:36.730 --> 00:57:36.740 align:start position:0%
summer period despite requests to meet
 
00:57:39.650 --> 00:57:39.660 align:start position:0%
in the summer or even in August and the
 
00:57:41.150 --> 00:57:41.160 align:start position:0%
earliest dates we normally get to
 
00:57:42.589 --> 00:57:42.599 align:start position:0%
convene with the school boards are in
 
00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
mid-september which becomes increasingly
 
00:57:46.910 --> 00:57:46.920 align:start position:0%
differently when difficult when schools
 
00:57:50.750 --> 00:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
are also starting up in September
 
00:57:52.670 --> 00:57:52.680 align:start position:0%
um I've even had some school boards come
 
00:57:53.690 --> 00:57:53.700 align:start position:0%
back with dates that they're available
 
00:57:56.690 --> 00:57:56.700 align:start position:0%
to begin negotiations in October
 
00:57:58.549 --> 00:57:58.559 align:start position:0%
I've had Two school boards in my region
 
00:58:00.470 --> 00:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
start starting negotiations in late
 
00:58:02.990 --> 00:58:03.000 align:start position:0%
October both also had delays during the
 
00:58:05.329 --> 00:58:05.339 align:start position:0%
process beyond the late start in October
 
00:58:07.370 --> 00:58:07.380 align:start position:0%
this left me with less than a month
 
00:58:08.990 --> 00:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
before I had to make a decision on
 
00:58:11.329 --> 00:58:11.339 align:start position:0%
whether or not we were at impasse in
 
00:58:12.829 --> 00:58:12.839 align:start position:0%
both of these scenarios we had to go to
 
00:58:14.630 --> 00:58:14.640 align:start position:0%
mediation and the parties had to pay for
 
00:58:16.730 --> 00:58:16.740 align:start position:0%
an advance process that likely would not
 
00:58:18.290 --> 00:58:18.300 align:start position:0%
have been needed if we had started
 
00:58:18.300 --> 00:58:19.910 align:start position:0%
have been needed if we had started
earlier

00:58:19.910 --> 00:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
00:58:22.069 --> 00:58:22.079 align:start position:0%
we were able to successfully reach an
 
00:58:24.109 --> 00:58:24.119 align:start position:0%
agreement in one of those contracts just
 
00:58:26.030 --> 00:58:26.040 align:start position:0%
in time but we did not for the other
 
00:58:28.490 --> 00:58:28.500 align:start position:0%
contract and those support staff went an
 
00:58:30.109 --> 00:58:30.119 align:start position:0%
entire year without any wages or
 
00:58:33.230 --> 00:58:33.240 align:start position:0%
benefits increase this was unnecessary
 
00:58:34.790 --> 00:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
speaking from experience I can tell you
 
00:58:36.530 --> 00:58:36.540 align:start position:0%
that most of the time late starts and
 
00:58:38.089 --> 00:58:38.099 align:start position:0%
delays in the bargaining process has to
 
00:58:39.710 --> 00:58:39.720 align:start position:0%
do with the schedules of specific
 
00:58:41.870 --> 00:58:41.880 align:start position:0%
individuals to serve on the school board
 
00:58:43.630 --> 00:58:43.640 align:start position:0%
and or attorney's board
 
00:58:47.390 --> 00:58:47.400 align:start position:0%
if they are using one it is the ability
 
00:58:50.270 --> 00:58:50.280 align:start position:0%
to negotiate at reasonable times that
 
00:58:52.490 --> 00:58:52.500 align:start position:0%
causes the issue sometimes that happens
 
00:58:53.990 --> 00:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
with the associations team as well
 
00:58:56.210 --> 00:58:56.220 align:start position:0%
although we work fairly diligently to
 
00:58:58.250 --> 00:58:58.260 align:start position:0%
elect team members who know they have to
 
00:59:00.230 --> 00:59:00.240 align:start position:0%
be flexible with their schedule
 
00:59:02.210 --> 00:59:02.220 align:start position:0%
when we are unsuccessful in negotiating
 
00:59:04.370 --> 00:59:04.380 align:start position:0%
a time in a timely fashion we simply
 
00:59:06.410 --> 00:59:06.420 align:start position:0%
won't have a contract ready
 
00:59:08.690 --> 00:59:08.700 align:start position:0%
wages and benefits won't be addressed
 
00:59:10.430 --> 00:59:10.440 align:start position:0%
when seasoned employees become Frozen
 
00:59:12.770 --> 00:59:12.780 align:start position:0%
onstep due to an expired contract often
 
00:59:14.270 --> 00:59:14.280 align:start position:0%
that means new hires are being brought
 
00:59:16.010 --> 00:59:16.020 align:start position:0%
into the district at a step that is
 
00:59:18.170 --> 00:59:18.180 align:start position:0%
close if not on or above the level of
 
00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
seasoned employees your existing
 
00:59:22.730 --> 00:59:22.740 align:start position:0%
employees will feel undervalued Labor
 
00:59:24.589 --> 00:59:24.599 align:start position:0%
Management relations worsen and we see
 
00:59:26.390 --> 00:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
the Exodus of seasoned employees
 
00:59:28.370 --> 00:59:28.380 align:start position:0%
professionals from the school district's
 
00:59:30.950 --> 00:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
increase we are not at a time and place
 
00:59:33.049 --> 00:59:33.059 align:start position:0%
right now with education that we can
 
00:59:35.030 --> 00:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
afford to have seasoned employees leave
 
00:59:36.710 --> 00:59:36.720 align:start position:0%
the district from the teacher or
 
00:59:40.190 --> 00:59:40.200 align:start position:0%
paraprofessional ranks and we are not
 
00:59:42.650 --> 00:59:42.660 align:start position:0%
having floods of new employees come in
 
00:59:44.329 --> 00:59:44.339 align:start position:0%
and education through the teacher or
 
00:59:46.250 --> 00:59:46.260 align:start position:0%
paraprofessional ranks and we are
 
00:59:48.349 --> 00:59:48.359 align:start position:0%
experiencing significant staff shortages
 
00:59:51.049 --> 00:59:51.059 align:start position:0%
in both the teacher and paraprofessional
 
00:59:53.270 --> 00:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
groups I have anywhere in the upwards
 
00:59:55.569 --> 00:59:55.579 align:start position:0%
bounds in many of my Region
 
00:59:58.730 --> 00:59:58.740 align:start position:0%
20 vacancies and support staff groups
 
01:00:01.010 --> 01:00:01.020 align:start position:0%
and significant vacancies in the teacher
 
01:00:03.230 --> 01:00:03.240 align:start position:0%
groups if we don't have these contracts
 
01:00:05.470 --> 01:00:05.480 align:start position:0%
ready to pass we will see
 
01:00:08.690 --> 01:00:08.700 align:start position:0%
significantly larger vacancies and our
 
01:00:11.150 --> 01:00:11.160 align:start position:0%
ability to support the children in the
 
01:00:12.289 --> 01:00:12.299 align:start position:0%
communities that go to these Public
 
01:00:14.270 --> 01:00:14.280 align:start position:0%
Schools is going to become increasingly
 
01:00:16.130 --> 01:00:16.140 align:start position:0%
problematic for the general population
 
01:00:17.870 --> 01:00:17.880 align:start position:0%
of children and for the special
 
01:00:20.329 --> 01:00:20.339 align:start position:0%
education population who have IEP
 
01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
demands that have to be meeting a legal
 
01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:25.069 align:start position:0%
demands that have to be meeting a legal
threshold

01:00:25.069 --> 01:00:25.079 align:start position:0%
threshold
 
01:00:26.870 --> 01:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
um we have an obligation as parties to
 
01:00:28.309 --> 01:00:28.319 align:start position:0%
meet at a reasonable time frame and to
 
01:00:30.230 --> 01:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
support Public Schools public education
 
01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
teachers and our support staff Senate
 
01:00:34.549 --> 01:00:34.559 align:start position:0%
Bill 193 established a requirement for
 
01:00:36.710 --> 01:00:36.720 align:start position:0%
the parties to meet within 10 days once
 
01:00:38.450 --> 01:00:38.460 align:start position:0%
the request has been issued we believe
 
01:00:40.370 --> 01:00:40.380 align:start position:0%
this bill provides a vital tool for the
 
01:00:42.650 --> 01:00:42.660 align:start position:0%
parties to be able to come together and
 
01:00:44.690 --> 01:00:44.700 align:start position:0%
to continue to negotiate in good faith
 
01:00:46.910 --> 01:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
it does not compel either party to agree
 
01:00:49.430 --> 01:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
to anything but it does bring them to
 
01:00:52.130 --> 01:00:52.140 align:start position:0%
the table to continue to negotiate as
 
01:00:54.650 --> 01:00:54.660 align:start position:0%
they are obligated to as I experience in
 
01:00:56.210 --> 01:00:56.220 align:start position:0%
Maine I suspect this tool will be
 
01:00:58.069 --> 01:00:58.079 align:start position:0%
available as a last resort and will not
 
01:00:59.930 --> 01:00:59.940 align:start position:0%
be used frequently however having it
 
01:01:01.490 --> 01:01:01.500 align:start position:0%
available will continue to motivate the
 
01:01:03.230 --> 01:01:03.240 align:start position:0%
parties to engage in a timely fashion
 
01:01:05.329 --> 01:01:05.339 align:start position:0%
and it will preserve the positive Labor
 
01:01:06.829 --> 01:01:06.839 align:start position:0%
Management relations between the parties
 
01:01:08.930 --> 01:01:08.940 align:start position:0%
and make a significant difference for
 
01:01:11.569 --> 01:01:11.579 align:start position:0%
all public employees when delays become
 
01:01:13.549 --> 01:01:13.559 align:start position:0%
an issue in the process and I do believe
 
01:01:15.829 --> 01:01:15.839 align:start position:0%
it'll help continue to keep the
 
01:01:18.410 --> 01:01:18.420 align:start position:0%
contracts in a healthy place to preserve
 
01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
and protect the staff we have and bring
 
01:01:23.150 --> 01:01:23.160 align:start position:0%
more quality employees to the public
 
01:01:25.910 --> 01:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
education field thank you thank you for
 
01:01:28.970 --> 01:01:28.980 align:start position:0%
your testimony and that testimony you
 
01:01:31.490 --> 01:01:31.500 align:start position:0%
have written copies thank you if you
 
01:01:33.170 --> 01:01:33.180 align:start position:0%
could pass those out when you're done I
 
01:01:35.030 --> 01:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
would appreciate it
 
01:01:37.730 --> 01:01:37.740 align:start position:0%
um I do have a question you mentioned at
 
01:01:40.010 --> 01:01:40.020 align:start position:0%
least one specific case and I assume
 
01:01:43.250 --> 01:01:43.260 align:start position:0%
that problems motivated uh the language
 
01:01:45.650 --> 01:01:45.660 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
01:01:48.770 --> 01:01:48.780 align:start position:0%
was there any case of let's say a
 
01:01:52.069 --> 01:01:52.079 align:start position:0%
deliberate delay that was brought to the
 
01:01:52.079 --> 01:01:53.510 align:start position:0%
deliberate delay that was brought to the
pelrb

01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
pelrb
 
01:01:56.930 --> 01:01:56.940 align:start position:0%
and if so what happened we had one case
 
01:01:58.670 --> 01:01:58.680 align:start position:0%
with a deliberate delay was brought to
 
01:02:00.049 --> 01:02:00.059 align:start position:0%
the plrb but there were other issues
 
01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
that was brought in that case as well
 
01:02:03.470 --> 01:02:03.480 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:02:05.510 --> 01:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
um the delivery delay was not something
 
01:02:07.130 --> 01:02:07.140 align:start position:0%
that was at the Forefront of the
 
01:02:08.870 --> 01:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
argument and it wasn't specifically
 
01:02:11.329 --> 01:02:11.339 align:start position:0%
addressed by the plrb rather the other
 
01:02:13.190 --> 01:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
issues that were brought were
 
01:02:16.130 --> 01:02:16.140 align:start position:0%
um were addressed in the final order all
 
01:02:17.510 --> 01:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
right thank you
 
01:02:19.609 --> 01:02:19.619 align:start position:0%
other questions representative McKenzie
 
01:02:23.089 --> 01:02:23.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:26.089 --> 01:02:26.099 align:start position:0%
everybody knows when the contract ends
 
01:02:28.010 --> 01:02:28.020 align:start position:0%
correct correct and everybody knows what
 
01:02:29.870 --> 01:02:29.880 align:start position:0%
the date's going to be correct and you
 
01:02:31.970 --> 01:02:31.980 align:start position:0%
know that years ahead of time in some
 
01:02:34.670 --> 01:02:34.680 align:start position:0%
cases yeah thank you
 
01:02:37.370 --> 01:02:37.380 align:start position:0%
other questions representative Granger
 
01:02:39.049 --> 01:02:39.059 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
01:02:39.059 --> 01:02:39.770 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
um

01:02:39.770 --> 01:02:39.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:43.609 --> 01:02:43.619 align:start position:0%
so why would anyone delay a timely
 
01:02:45.470 --> 01:02:45.480 align:start position:0%
meeting uh what's what's the what's
 
01:02:47.930 --> 01:02:47.940 align:start position:0%
generally the purpose of uh delaying um
 
01:02:49.849 --> 01:02:49.859 align:start position:0%
so for instance I believe you said that
 
01:02:51.770 --> 01:02:51.780 align:start position:0%
it benefits both sides what I'm trying
 
01:02:53.390 --> 01:02:53.400 align:start position:0%
to get at is uh why why do we need to
 
01:02:55.010 --> 01:02:55.020 align:start position:0%
have a law for it if it's in both sides
 
01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:56.450 align:start position:0%
have a law for it if it's in both sides
interest

01:02:56.450 --> 01:02:56.460 align:start position:0%
interest
 
01:02:57.950 --> 01:02:57.960 align:start position:0%
um what we see frequently happen and
 
01:02:59.569 --> 01:02:59.579 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's untouched a lot of times
 
01:03:01.849 --> 01:03:01.859 align:start position:0%
it's unintentional but what we see
 
01:03:03.829 --> 01:03:03.839 align:start position:0%
frequently happen is when when both
 
01:03:07.190 --> 01:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
sides select their teams I think and
 
01:03:08.150 --> 01:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
frequently we see it with the board
 
01:03:09.950 --> 01:03:09.960 align:start position:0%
teams there isn't a lot of vetting about
 
01:03:12.890 --> 01:03:12.900 align:start position:0%
availability for schedules and sometimes
 
01:03:14.930 --> 01:03:14.940 align:start position:0%
when that team is formed from the board
 
01:03:17.630 --> 01:03:17.640 align:start position:0%
side one or more members of the team
 
01:03:19.430 --> 01:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
have restrictions on their availability
 
01:03:21.410 --> 01:03:21.420 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:03:23.329 --> 01:03:23.339 align:start position:0%
um we try very hard when we form the
 
01:03:24.710 --> 01:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
association teams to let people know
 
01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
that if they they become part of the
 
01:03:28.370 --> 01:03:28.380 align:start position:0%
team they have to be extremely flexible
 
01:03:29.930 --> 01:03:29.940 align:start position:0%
because we need to move this contract as
 
01:03:31.250 --> 01:03:31.260 align:start position:0%
quickly as possible and they're
 
01:03:32.630 --> 01:03:32.640 align:start position:0%
motivated because these are also their
 
01:03:33.770 --> 01:03:33.780 align:start position:0%
wages and benefits and working
 
01:03:36.289 --> 01:03:36.299 align:start position:0%
conditions and not to say that the board
 
01:03:37.730 --> 01:03:37.740 align:start position:0%
doesn't take the negotiation seriously
 
01:03:39.530 --> 01:03:39.540 align:start position:0%
because I believe they do but I think
 
01:03:41.089 --> 01:03:41.099 align:start position:0%
when these individuals come to the table
 
01:03:43.130 --> 01:03:43.140 align:start position:0%
the dates that come across to them
 
01:03:44.870 --> 01:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
simply and a lot of times don't work in
 
01:03:46.490 --> 01:03:46.500 align:start position:0%
their personal lives so often they're
 
01:03:47.870 --> 01:03:47.880 align:start position:0%
having to say I can't do that day I
 
01:03:49.849 --> 01:03:49.859 align:start position:0%
can't do that day I can't do that day so
 
01:03:52.549 --> 01:03:52.559 align:start position:0%
I think this will help give the parties
 
01:03:54.349 --> 01:03:54.359 align:start position:0%
um more focus when they're selecting a
 
01:03:57.470 --> 01:03:57.480 align:start position:0%
team to make it clear that that we need
 
01:03:58.670 --> 01:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
to be able to get to the table in a
 
01:04:00.770 --> 01:04:00.780 align:start position:0%
timely fashion and if this if this
 
01:04:02.870 --> 01:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
request is issued we have two weeks to
 
01:04:04.490 --> 01:04:04.500 align:start position:0%
get there and you need to make your
 
01:04:06.410 --> 01:04:06.420 align:start position:0%
schedule work or we may have to go to
 
01:04:08.510 --> 01:04:08.520 align:start position:0%
the table without you or select an
 
01:04:09.829 --> 01:04:09.839 align:start position:0%
alternative I think it's going to force
 
01:04:11.870 --> 01:04:11.880 align:start position:0%
the parties to think more clearly about
 
01:04:13.130 --> 01:04:13.140 align:start position:0%
who they have at the table and
 
01:04:16.990 --> 01:04:17.000 align:start position:0%
Alternatives if people have conflicts
 
01:04:21.170 --> 01:04:21.180 align:start position:0%
follow up so uh if you're if you're a
 
01:04:22.970 --> 01:04:22.980 align:start position:0%
member of a school board
 
01:04:24.530 --> 01:04:24.540 align:start position:0%
um and you want to pursue other options
 
01:04:26.630 --> 01:04:26.640 align:start position:0%
rather than working with the Union uh
 
01:04:28.069 --> 01:04:28.079 align:start position:0%
would this sort of prohibit that because
 
01:04:29.390 --> 01:04:29.400 align:start position:0%
you're still forced to engage in
 
01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
negotiations with the Union
 
01:04:33.890 --> 01:04:33.900 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure I understand your
 
01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
question well if you're in a school
 
01:04:36.710 --> 01:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
board and you don't want to continue
 
01:04:39.049 --> 01:04:39.059 align:start position:0%
pursuing negotiations with the Union if
 
01:04:40.370 --> 01:04:40.380 align:start position:0%
the town decides that they want to go in
 
01:04:42.349 --> 01:04:42.359 align:start position:0%
another route wouldn't this sort of
 
01:04:43.609 --> 01:04:43.619 align:start position:0%
prevent that
 
01:04:46.130 --> 01:04:46.140 align:start position:0%
I think it would I think it would force
 
01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
you to have to come to the table in two
 
01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:48.829 align:start position:0%
you to have to come to the table in two
weeks

01:04:48.829 --> 01:04:48.839 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
01:04:51.170 --> 01:04:51.180 align:start position:0%
um your Chief negotiator would have to
 
01:04:52.309 --> 01:04:52.319 align:start position:0%
reach out to the association make
 
01:04:54.530 --> 01:04:54.540 align:start position:0%
arrangements to come to the table you
 
01:04:56.089 --> 01:04:56.099 align:start position:0%
have to negotiate in good faith and this
 
01:04:58.010 --> 01:04:58.020 align:start position:0%
gets you there it doesn't compel you to
 
01:04:59.750 --> 01:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
agree to anything so at the end of the
 
01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
day you may still reach a place where
 
01:05:02.930 --> 01:05:02.940 align:start position:0%
you don't have a contract but it won't
 
01:05:04.849 --> 01:05:04.859 align:start position:0%
because it won't be because you didn't
 
01:05:06.589 --> 01:05:06.599 align:start position:0%
convene it'll be because you couldn't
 
01:05:09.230 --> 01:05:09.240 align:start position:0%
mutually agree on terms this won't Force
 
01:05:11.329 --> 01:05:11.339 align:start position:0%
the parties to reach agreement it forces
 
01:05:12.589 --> 01:05:12.599 align:start position:0%
the parties to come to the table and
 
01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
continue to have those constructive
 
01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:15.530 align:start position:0%
continue to have those constructive
discussions

01:05:15.530 --> 01:05:15.540 align:start position:0%
discussions
 
01:05:17.450 --> 01:05:17.460 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:05:19.370 --> 01:05:19.380 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
01:05:21.470 --> 01:05:21.480 align:start position:0%
and I'll come back to you if if anyone
 
01:05:23.569 --> 01:05:23.579 align:start position:0%
else has a first question
 
01:05:27.109 --> 01:05:27.119 align:start position:0%
I uh representative
 
01:05:28.670 --> 01:05:28.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question thank
 
01:05:30.470 --> 01:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair uh you just mentioned two
 
01:05:33.289 --> 01:05:33.299 align:start position:0%
weeks would you be uh uh okay with 10
 
01:05:34.609 --> 01:05:34.619 align:start position:0%
working days
 
01:05:36.349 --> 01:05:36.359 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean it's a 10-day demand so
 
01:05:37.910 --> 01:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
essentially the schools only really meet
 
01:05:39.530 --> 01:05:39.540 align:start position:0%
during work days so it would be 10
 
01:05:42.170 --> 01:05:42.180 align:start position:0%
working days I say two weeks because we
 
01:05:43.970 --> 01:05:43.980 align:start position:0%
don't generally meet on weekends but I
 
01:05:45.410 --> 01:05:45.420 align:start position:0%
have in my in the past we've made
 
01:05:46.730 --> 01:05:46.740 align:start position:0%
exceptions in many weekends but that's
 
01:05:48.049 --> 01:05:48.059 align:start position:0%
not the norm with education you're
 
01:05:50.990 --> 01:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
correct thank you
 
01:05:53.049 --> 01:05:53.059 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie thank you
 
01:05:55.430 --> 01:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in the law that prevents
 
01:05:58.970 --> 01:05:58.980 align:start position:0%
you six months out four months out three
 
01:06:01.130 --> 01:06:01.140 align:start position:0%
months out from meeting with the with
 
01:06:04.069 --> 01:06:04.079 align:start position:0%
the employer's team and coming up with
 
01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
schedules at that point knowing full
 
01:06:07.970 --> 01:06:07.980 align:start position:0%
well that the contrast is going to
 
01:06:09.710 --> 01:06:09.720 align:start position:0%
expire correct there's nothing in fact
 
01:06:11.270 --> 01:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
when we meet at the ground Rules meeting
 
01:06:12.829 --> 01:06:12.839 align:start position:0%
we set a schedule in advance but
 
01:06:14.329 --> 01:06:14.339 align:start position:0%
sometimes that schedule is just not kept
 
01:06:16.069 --> 01:06:16.079 align:start position:0%
with because people determine they have
 
01:06:17.930 --> 01:06:17.940 align:start position:0%
conflicts and that's often what causes
 
01:06:20.089 --> 01:06:20.099 align:start position:0%
the issue thank you
 
01:06:22.430 --> 01:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:24.240 align:start position:0%

AFL-CIO and our over 35 000 members I
 
01:06:59.450 --> 01:06:59.460 align:start position:0%
come for you to ask you to vote to pass
 
01:07:02.630 --> 01:07:02.640 align:start position:0%
on Senate Bill 193 which is a bipartisan
 
01:07:04.730 --> 01:07:04.740 align:start position:0%
effort sponsored by legislators in both
 
01:07:07.490 --> 01:07:07.500 align:start position:0%
chambers of both parties my brothers
 
01:07:10.069 --> 01:07:10.079 align:start position:0%
sisters from the Nea just did a lot of
 
01:07:11.569 --> 01:07:11.579 align:start position:0%
what I was going to do so in the
 
01:07:14.870 --> 01:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
interest of time I will scoot down to
 
01:07:17.569 --> 01:07:17.579 align:start position:0%
the middle of this testimony and say
 
01:07:19.970 --> 01:07:19.980 align:start position:0%
um so in the process uh the negotiation
 
01:07:22.010 --> 01:07:22.020 align:start position:0%
process obviously timeliness is
 
01:07:24.109 --> 01:07:24.119 align:start position:0%
extremely important when an existing
 
01:07:26.450 --> 01:07:26.460 align:start position:0%
contract is set to expire it serves the
 
01:07:28.730 --> 01:07:28.740 align:start position:0%
interest the employer the employees and
 
01:07:32.089 --> 01:07:32.099 align:start position:0%
the organization to negotiate and or to
 
01:07:33.770 --> 01:07:33.780 align:start position:0%
initiate the negotiations and conclude
 
01:07:36.470 --> 01:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
them before a contract expires in the
 
01:07:38.089 --> 01:07:38.099 align:start position:0%
event that the contract expires without
 
01:07:40.069 --> 01:07:40.079 align:start position:0%
a new one agreed to it's not only the
 
01:07:41.930 --> 01:07:41.940 align:start position:0%
workers seeking the agreement that
 
01:07:43.430 --> 01:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
suffer but the Employers in the
 
01:07:46.250 --> 01:07:46.260 align:start position:0%
organization as well this can create
 
01:07:48.109 --> 01:07:48.119 align:start position:0%
tension between the workers and the
 
01:07:49.849 --> 01:07:49.859 align:start position:0%
management which is bad and has
 
01:07:52.490 --> 01:07:52.500 align:start position:0%
consequences of its own but even more
 
01:07:54.349 --> 01:07:54.359 align:start position:0%
crucially in some cases this could mean
 
01:07:56.990 --> 01:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
a delay in services that are vital to
 
01:07:59.270 --> 01:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
the functioning of a state municipality
 
01:08:02.210 --> 01:08:02.220 align:start position:0%
a branch of either of those so in
 
01:08:03.950 --> 01:08:03.960 align:start position:0%
conclusion this bill strengthens the
 
01:08:05.750 --> 01:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
entire process of bargaining providing
 
01:08:08.029 --> 01:08:08.039 align:start position:0%
all parties with the competence trust
 
01:08:10.010 --> 01:08:10.020 align:start position:0%
and reasonable expectations regarding
 
01:08:11.990 --> 01:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
the negotiation process and the contract
 
01:08:14.750 --> 01:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
at hand and it's for these reasons that
 
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:16.140 align:start position:0%
we urge you to vote ought to pass on
 
01:08:18.050 --> 01:08:18.060 align:start position:0%
this so thank you guys I take any
 
01:08:20.090 --> 01:08:20.100 align:start position:0%

01:11:59.570 --> 01:11:59.580 align:start position:0%
because he's the he's the detail
 
01:12:01.550 --> 01:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
specialist but really there's two things
 
01:12:02.750 --> 01:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
we're trying to accomplish here the
 
01:12:05.630 --> 01:12:05.640 align:start position:0%
first is under current statute there is
 
01:12:07.430 --> 01:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
a definition of a tip which includes the
 
01:12:09.169 --> 01:12:09.179 align:start position:0%
term service charge which creates a
 
01:12:10.370 --> 01:12:10.380 align:start position:0%
little bit of a conflict for our
 
01:12:13.790 --> 01:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
industry because under IRS rules uh a
 
01:12:15.649 --> 01:12:15.659 align:start position:0%
service charge is automatically income
 
01:12:17.209 --> 01:12:17.219 align:start position:0%
of the business and therefore taxable
 
01:12:20.630 --> 01:12:20.640 align:start position:0%
under IRS tax rules but under state law
 
01:12:23.689 --> 01:12:23.699 align:start position:0%
under in the um in the definition of a
 
01:12:26.450 --> 01:12:26.460 align:start position:0%
tip or gratuity uh it is considered a
 
01:12:27.770 --> 01:12:27.780 align:start position:0%
typical gratuity and therefore
 
01:12:29.870 --> 01:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
automatically owned by the employee
 
01:12:32.510 --> 01:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
receiving the tip or the gratuity so now
 
01:12:34.790 --> 01:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
you have this weird situation where a
 
01:12:36.350 --> 01:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
business is being taxed on income that
 
01:12:38.149 --> 01:12:38.159 align:start position:0%
it never receives and actually belongs
 
01:12:40.370 --> 01:12:40.380 align:start position:0%
to the employee so that really is a
 
01:12:42.410 --> 01:12:42.420 align:start position:0%
technical correction it's one that we've
 
01:12:44.090 --> 01:12:44.100 align:start position:0%
had discussions with Department of Labor
 
01:12:45.770 --> 01:12:45.780 align:start position:0%
and I think they agree with us on on
 
01:12:47.510 --> 01:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
this slight change
 
01:12:50.090 --> 01:12:50.100 align:start position:0%
the other piece is around tip pulling
 
01:12:51.770 --> 01:12:51.780 align:start position:0%
and tip sharing language
 
01:12:53.390 --> 01:12:53.400 align:start position:0%
and we've had some businesses that have
 
01:12:55.189 --> 01:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
kind of run into some quirky problems
 
01:12:58.490 --> 01:12:58.500 align:start position:0%
where uh you know in the air their
 
01:13:00.169 --> 01:13:00.179 align:start position:0%
attempt to essentially assist their
 
01:13:01.790 --> 01:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
employees with their tip sharing or tip
 
01:13:03.530 --> 01:13:03.540 align:start position:0%
pooling Arrangement and the document
 
01:13:06.290 --> 01:13:06.300 align:start position:0%
documentation thereof uh it has come to
 
01:13:10.310 --> 01:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
a situation where the department uh has
 
01:13:11.930 --> 01:13:11.940 align:start position:0%
ruled that you know they have
 
01:13:14.090 --> 01:13:14.100 align:start position:0%
said or done something inadvertently and
 
01:13:15.590 --> 01:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
because of the way this language is
 
01:13:17.870 --> 01:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
currently in statute which says that it
 
01:13:19.790 --> 01:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
has to be the request of the employee
 
01:13:22.189 --> 01:13:22.199 align:start position:0%
you know the the employer is essentially
 
01:13:24.770 --> 01:13:24.780 align:start position:0%
uh having a conversation saying you know
 
01:13:26.510 --> 01:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
hey what are we doing with this how is
 
01:13:28.250 --> 01:13:28.260 align:start position:0%
this going to be handled and at that
 
01:13:29.689 --> 01:13:29.699 align:start position:0%
point technically they're in violation
 
01:13:31.250 --> 01:13:31.260 align:start position:0%
of the statute so the point here is to
 
01:13:32.570 --> 01:13:32.580 align:start position:0%
really just remove that piece of it
 
01:13:35.390 --> 01:13:35.400 align:start position:0%
allow open discourse between the two it
 
01:13:37.490 --> 01:13:37.500 align:start position:0%
does not change the current policy where
 
01:13:40.490 --> 01:13:40.500 align:start position:0%
the tips are owned by the employee that
 
01:13:42.290 --> 01:13:42.300 align:start position:0%
their participation in a tip pulling a
 
01:13:43.610 --> 01:13:43.620 align:start position:0%
tip sharing Arrangement is still
 
01:13:45.410 --> 01:13:45.420 align:start position:0%
voluntary without coercion so it doesn't
 
01:13:48.229 --> 01:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
really change that it just changes this
 
01:13:50.209 --> 01:13:50.219 align:start position:0%
uh one little piece in the statute which
 
01:13:51.530 --> 01:13:51.540 align:start position:0%
has created a lot of friction between
 
01:13:53.390 --> 01:13:53.400 align:start position:0%
businesses and the department and
 
01:13:56.149 --> 01:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
statutes so I think that's kind of the
 
01:13:58.250 --> 01:13:58.260 align:start position:0%
Crux of it all and I'm happy to try to
 
01:14:02.530 --> 01:14:02.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:05.510 --> 01:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
anywhere uh representative Cahill
 
01:14:07.310 --> 01:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr
 
01:14:09.410 --> 01:14:09.420 align:start position:0%
Summers for taking my question I'm I'm
 
01:14:11.030 --> 01:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
completely in agreement to understand
 
01:14:13.010 --> 01:14:13.020 align:start position:0%
about the service chart I'm just going
 
01:14:14.930 --> 01:14:14.940 align:start position:0%
to change that to gratuity and I'm
 
01:14:17.209 --> 01:14:17.219 align:start position:0%
assuming that on all the receipts that
 
01:14:19.610 --> 01:14:19.620 align:start position:0%
the restaurants have it'll say gratuity
 
01:14:22.550 --> 01:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
instead of service charge uh I'm a
 
01:14:24.770 --> 01:14:24.780 align:start position:0%
little bit concerned about the tip
 
01:14:27.229 --> 01:14:27.239 align:start position:0%
pooling tip sharing because I I did read
 
01:14:30.709 --> 01:14:30.719 align:start position:0%
your uh I read the Senate testimony and
 
01:14:32.510 --> 01:14:32.520 align:start position:0%
I believe you said that tip pooling is
 
01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:33.970 align:start position:0%
I believe you said that tip pooling is
rare

01:14:33.970 --> 01:14:33.980 align:start position:0%
rare
 
01:14:36.530 --> 01:14:36.540 align:start position:0%
which sounds a little odd because I you
 
01:14:38.630 --> 01:14:38.640 align:start position:0%
know we have go to a restaurant you see
 
01:14:41.270 --> 01:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
the the server takes the the dollars
 
01:14:44.030 --> 01:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
that used to be dollars and put it puts
 
01:14:45.830 --> 01:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
it in the jar and they all get a piece
 
01:14:48.290 --> 01:14:48.300 align:start position:0%
of that later uh that's different from I
 
01:14:50.270 --> 01:14:50.280 align:start position:0%
guess how it works with the credit cards
 
01:14:54.050 --> 01:14:54.060 align:start position:0%
and so you you would record all the uh
 
01:14:55.970 --> 01:14:55.980 align:start position:0%
tips that are listed on the credit card
 
01:14:57.410 --> 01:14:57.420 align:start position:0%
you know six dollars for this whatever
 
01:15:00.189 --> 01:15:00.199 align:start position:0%
that is and then at the end of that
 
01:15:02.930 --> 01:15:02.940 align:start position:0%
these are still shared among all this
 
01:15:04.970 --> 01:15:04.980 align:start position:0%
all the way staff correct is that
 
01:15:04.980 --> 01:15:06.830 align:start position:0%
all the way staff correct is that
correct

01:15:06.830 --> 01:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:15:09.830 --> 01:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
yes and no so let me clarify
 
01:15:11.270 --> 01:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
yeah I know that's a bad spell
 
01:15:13.189 --> 01:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
replacement I I just want to address you
 
01:15:15.890 --> 01:15:15.900 align:start position:0%
correct I think directly but so that let
 
01:15:17.450 --> 01:15:17.460 align:start position:0%
me clarify the difference between tip
 
01:15:19.430 --> 01:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
pooling and tip sharing so tip pooling
 
01:15:20.570 --> 01:15:20.580 align:start position:0%
is what you characterize where
 
01:15:22.310 --> 01:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
everything goes into a jar the scenario
 
01:15:24.110 --> 01:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
is where we see that most often would be
 
01:15:25.790 --> 01:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
behind a bar you have three bartenders
 
01:15:27.470 --> 01:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
the kind of all crossing over each other
 
01:15:29.270 --> 01:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
helping customers they all have access
 
01:15:31.610 --> 01:15:31.620 align:start position:0%
to the same register almost impossible
 
01:15:33.470 --> 01:15:33.480 align:start position:0%
to determine who owns what part of the
 
01:15:34.910 --> 01:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
tip so therefore they come to some
 
01:15:36.890 --> 01:15:36.900 align:start position:0%
arrangement within their group of what
 
01:15:38.390 --> 01:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
the tip pool will look like how it's
 
01:15:40.550 --> 01:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
calculated who gets what the other
 
01:15:43.550 --> 01:15:43.560 align:start position:0%
instance we see it most commonly is and
 
01:15:45.649 --> 01:15:45.659 align:start position:0%
I guess a similar characterization to a
 
01:15:47.930 --> 01:15:47.940 align:start position:0%
bar would be also a scenario like Dunkin
 
01:15:49.970 --> 01:15:49.980 align:start position:0%
Donuts for example where you have
 
01:15:51.590 --> 01:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
numerous people are working a register
 
01:15:53.510 --> 01:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
people go back and forth there's no real
 
01:15:55.790 --> 01:15:55.800 align:start position:0%
ownership of the tip necessarily and so
 
01:15:57.530 --> 01:15:57.540 align:start position:0%
it'd be kind of a collective uh you know
 
01:15:58.850 --> 01:15:58.860 align:start position:0%
group and they would decide how they
 
01:16:00.770 --> 01:16:00.780 align:start position:0%
wanted to break it up amongst themselves
 
01:16:02.689 --> 01:16:02.699 align:start position:0%
the other scenario where we see tip
 
01:16:04.610 --> 01:16:04.620 align:start position:0%
pulling pretty common is usually in
 
01:16:06.709 --> 01:16:06.719 align:start position:0%
function facilities so a function
 
01:16:09.410 --> 01:16:09.420 align:start position:0%
facility because you know you have such
 
01:16:11.030 --> 01:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
a large number of people waiting on such
 
01:16:12.709 --> 01:16:12.719 align:start position:0%
a large number of people almost
 
01:16:15.110 --> 01:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
impossible to determine how much of each
 
01:16:18.590 --> 01:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
individual guest or participant towards
 
01:16:21.890 --> 01:16:21.900 align:start position:0%
the gratuity would be uh attributable to
 
01:16:23.390 --> 01:16:23.400 align:start position:0%
each individual employee if that makes
 
01:16:24.770 --> 01:16:24.780 align:start position:0%
sense so then they have to come to some
 
01:16:26.270 --> 01:16:26.280 align:start position:0%
sort of an agreement about how it's
 
01:16:27.530 --> 01:16:27.540 align:start position:0%
going to be divvied up amongst everyone
 
01:16:29.149 --> 01:16:29.159 align:start position:0%
who's participating
 
01:16:31.610 --> 01:16:31.620 align:start position:0%
tip sharing is different in that in a
 
01:16:33.169 --> 01:16:33.179 align:start position:0%
tip sharing arrangement in a restaurant
 
01:16:35.149 --> 01:16:35.159 align:start position:0%
you would have a scenario where I have a
 
01:16:38.330 --> 01:16:38.340 align:start position:0%
section I have five or six tables of my
 
01:16:40.550 --> 01:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
five or six tables I am clearly the
 
01:16:42.950 --> 01:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
direct owner of those tips I waited on
 
01:16:44.570 --> 01:16:44.580 align:start position:0%
the table I collected the tips from the
 
01:16:47.450 --> 01:16:47.460 align:start position:0%
table etc etc and in that scenario tip
 
01:16:49.370 --> 01:16:49.380 align:start position:0%
share would be where they may tip out
 
01:16:51.050 --> 01:16:51.060 align:start position:0%
some at the end of the night to the
 
01:16:52.970 --> 01:16:52.980 align:start position:0%
bartender who did a nice job for them
 
01:16:54.890 --> 01:16:54.900 align:start position:0%
making their service drinks or to the
 
01:16:56.330 --> 01:16:56.340 align:start position:0%
food Runner that brought the food to the
 
01:16:57.530 --> 01:16:57.540 align:start position:0%
table or whatever it might be the bus
 
01:16:59.450 --> 01:16:59.460 align:start position:0%
boy they cleaned the table so that is
 
01:17:01.550 --> 01:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
more of a tip share Arrangement the
 
01:17:02.870 --> 01:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
credit card piece of it really doesn't
 
01:17:04.729 --> 01:17:04.739 align:start position:0%
come into it because the ownership is
 
01:17:06.649 --> 01:17:06.659 align:start position:0%
still clear depending on the scenario
 
01:17:08.810 --> 01:17:08.820 align:start position:0%
you find yourself in if that makes sense
 
01:17:11.810 --> 01:17:11.820 align:start position:0%
uh thank you I think it does uh it's
 
01:17:15.470 --> 01:17:15.480 align:start position:0%
only that if if the restaurant isn't
 
01:17:17.390 --> 01:17:17.400 align:start position:0%
really divided up into sections that
 
01:17:19.490 --> 01:17:19.500 align:start position:0%
this person Waits on that table that
 
01:17:21.229 --> 01:17:21.239 align:start position:0%
person Waits on that table and the
 
01:17:23.870 --> 01:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
credit card the fee the tax the tips are
 
01:17:25.250 --> 01:17:25.260 align:start position:0%
putting the credit cards which nobody
 
01:17:28.490 --> 01:17:28.500 align:start position:0%
carries cash and that at the end of it
 
01:17:32.149 --> 01:17:32.159 align:start position:0%
do are the tips not pooled in that
 
01:17:33.950 --> 01:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
situation they go to that person and
 
01:17:36.410 --> 01:17:36.420 align:start position:0%
that person correct so so you know if
 
01:17:37.970 --> 01:17:37.980 align:start position:0%
you have a section and you have assigned
 
01:17:40.310 --> 01:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
tables then that tip it may you know the
 
01:17:42.530 --> 01:17:42.540 align:start position:0%
business May hold and pay you in your
 
01:17:44.570 --> 01:17:44.580 align:start position:0%
paycheck at the next pay period or they
 
01:17:46.010 --> 01:17:46.020 align:start position:0%
may have enough cash in the building to
 
01:17:47.450 --> 01:17:47.460 align:start position:0%
give you tips when you leave that night
 
01:17:49.010 --> 01:17:49.020 align:start position:0%
it kind of depends on you know what
 
01:17:50.510 --> 01:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
credit cards it's created some problems
 
01:17:53.209 --> 01:17:53.219 align:start position:0%
but ultimately the owner of those tips
 
01:17:55.850 --> 01:17:55.860 align:start position:0%
in that situation is the employee the
 
01:17:58.130 --> 01:17:58.140 align:start position:0%
the server that waited on that table
 
01:17:58.140 --> 01:17:59.450 align:start position:0%
the server that waited on that table
follow-up

01:17:59.450 --> 01:17:59.460 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:18:02.270 --> 01:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
thank you my other concern here is is
 
01:18:04.550 --> 01:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
about what if you have somebody who
 
01:18:07.669 --> 01:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
wants to work as a server but doesn't
 
01:18:10.189 --> 01:18:10.199 align:start position:0%
really want to participate in the pool
 
01:18:12.709 --> 01:18:12.719 align:start position:0%
then again we have a corrosion but
 
01:18:14.149 --> 01:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
absolutely and there's no requirement
 
01:18:15.709 --> 01:18:15.719 align:start position:0%
that they participate
 
01:18:18.950 --> 01:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
how does that work in sorry how does
 
01:18:20.689 --> 01:18:20.699 align:start position:0%
that work in the real world
 
01:18:22.310 --> 01:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
well in the real world they would uh
 
01:18:24.050 --> 01:18:24.060 align:start position:0%
just at the end of the shift and and
 
01:18:25.610 --> 01:18:25.620 align:start position:0%
because at the end of the shift when you
 
01:18:27.169 --> 01:18:27.179 align:start position:0%
cash out with the business right this is
 
01:18:29.390 --> 01:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
where you if you have more cash than you
 
01:18:31.370 --> 01:18:31.380 align:start position:0%
have tips then you would remit to the
 
01:18:33.590 --> 01:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
business to cover the checks that you
 
01:18:35.930 --> 01:18:35.940 align:start position:0%
collected on Etc this is where the
 
01:18:37.669 --> 01:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
determination or the question would be
 
01:18:39.350 --> 01:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
asked do you want to tip anyone out
 
01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
tonight and so this is where businesses
 
01:18:43.490 --> 01:18:43.500 align:start position:0%
have run into trouble because now there
 
01:18:45.050 --> 01:18:45.060 align:start position:0%
are they're essentially asking that
 
01:18:46.970 --> 01:18:46.980 align:start position:0%
question at the end of a shift and so
 
01:18:49.250 --> 01:18:49.260 align:start position:0%
now a business could ultimately be said
 
01:18:51.110 --> 01:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
to be participating in discussion that
 
01:18:53.810 --> 01:18:53.820 align:start position:0%
needs to be inspired by the employee and
 
01:18:56.450 --> 01:18:56.460 align:start position:0%
so again not requiring coercion or
 
01:18:58.550 --> 01:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
participation the employee can simply
 
01:19:00.590 --> 01:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
say I didn't do well tonight I'm not
 
01:19:02.450 --> 01:19:02.460 align:start position:0%
participating in the tip share
 
01:19:07.430 --> 01:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:11.930 --> 01:19:11.940 align:start position:0%
any further questions for our Mr Summers
 
01:19:14.270 --> 01:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie thank you
 
01:19:15.950 --> 01:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
so there are many restaurants that you
 
01:19:17.630 --> 01:19:17.640 align:start position:0%
go into today where somebody Waits on
 
01:19:20.149 --> 01:19:20.159 align:start position:0%
you takes the order somebody drops a
 
01:19:22.130 --> 01:19:22.140 align:start position:0%
salad off different somebody drops the
 
01:19:24.649 --> 01:19:24.659 align:start position:0%
meal off different uh somebody collects
 
01:19:26.390 --> 01:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
a food at the end of the night different
 
01:19:29.450 --> 01:19:29.460 align:start position:0%
so how does that work
 
01:19:31.910 --> 01:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
I guess which part of that so when you
 
01:19:34.790 --> 01:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
go to who gets a tip and it's a tip
 
01:19:36.530 --> 01:19:36.540 align:start position:0%
shared with all of the people that
 
01:19:39.110 --> 01:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
dropped the salad off and and did that
 
01:19:40.250 --> 01:19:40.260 align:start position:0%
kind of thing during the course not
 
01:19:43.910 --> 01:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily so so the scenario I didn't
 
01:19:44.810 --> 01:19:44.820 align:start position:0%
think I'd be explaining restaurant
 
01:19:47.209 --> 01:19:47.219 align:start position:0%
operations but here we go so ultimately
 
01:19:49.189 --> 01:19:49.199 align:start position:0%
if a server has a section is assigned a
 
01:19:51.410 --> 01:19:51.420 align:start position:0%
table the tip belongs to the server
 
01:19:53.270 --> 01:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
at that point the server at the end of
 
01:19:55.189 --> 01:19:55.199 align:start position:0%
the night may just decide that hey you
 
01:19:57.770 --> 01:19:57.780 align:start position:0%
know this Susie did a great job busting
 
01:19:58.910 --> 01:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
my tables all night I'm going to give
 
01:20:00.950 --> 01:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
her a little something extra that's
 
01:20:02.630 --> 01:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
essentially how it works so at the point
 
01:20:04.010 --> 01:20:04.020 align:start position:0%
that this server is assigned those
 
01:20:05.570 --> 01:20:05.580 align:start position:0%
tables any tips that are generated by
 
01:20:10.310 --> 01:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:14.270 --> 01:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
one final one so you've just you said uh
 
01:20:17.750 --> 01:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
something made a statement about at the
 
01:20:19.910 --> 01:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
end of the night when they remit to the
 
01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:21.310 align:start position:0%
end of the night when they remit to the
employer

01:20:21.310 --> 01:20:21.320 align:start position:0%
employer
 
01:20:23.990 --> 01:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
so what did you mean by that statement
 
01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:25.750 align:start position:0%
so what did you mean by that statement
because

01:20:25.750 --> 01:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:20:29.149 --> 01:20:29.159 align:start position:0%
there were some um practices within
 
01:20:33.229 --> 01:20:33.239 align:start position:0%
where the where the uh uh wage staff
 
01:20:35.750 --> 01:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
would be paying be paying for the booze
 
01:20:37.130 --> 01:20:37.140 align:start position:0%
be paying for the liquor for instance at
 
01:20:38.390 --> 01:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
the end of the night they may go up to
 
01:20:41.810 --> 01:20:41.820 align:start position:0%
the bar and and uh and reconcile that
 
01:20:43.130 --> 01:20:43.140 align:start position:0%
with the employee that's not what you're
 
01:20:44.270 --> 01:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
talking about when you made that
 
01:20:46.250 --> 01:20:46.260 align:start position:0%
statement I'm saying that at the end of
 
01:20:47.930 --> 01:20:47.940 align:start position:0%
a shift you would cash out as an employ
 
01:20:49.550 --> 01:20:49.560 align:start position:0%
as a as a server because during the
 
01:20:50.990 --> 01:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
course of the night right so you're
 
01:20:52.550 --> 01:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
running credit cards you keep those
 
01:20:54.770 --> 01:20:54.780 align:start position:0%
credit card receipts you may receive
 
01:20:56.270 --> 01:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
cash whatever it might be at the end of
 
01:20:57.470 --> 01:20:57.480 align:start position:0%
the night you're just settling up you
 
01:21:01.010 --> 01:21:01.020 align:start position:0%
have a uh you issue a
 
01:21:03.110 --> 01:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
you know what I'm saying so you have a a
 
01:21:05.510 --> 01:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
receipt a receipt that you give to the
 
01:21:07.370 --> 01:21:07.380 align:start position:0%
the manager checking you out and shows
 
01:21:09.470 --> 01:21:09.480 align:start position:0%
your gross sales what was food what was
 
01:21:11.390 --> 01:21:11.400 align:start position:0%
beverage et cetera et cetera and at the
 
01:21:12.410 --> 01:21:12.420 align:start position:0%
end of it there's essentially a
 
01:21:14.149 --> 01:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
Reconciliation about I need this many
 
01:21:16.610 --> 01:21:16.620 align:start position:0%
credit card slips from you I need this
 
01:21:18.530 --> 01:21:18.540 align:start position:0%
much cash or I owe you this much cash
 
01:21:20.149 --> 01:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
because in today's environment with
 
01:21:22.189 --> 01:21:22.199 align:start position:0%
credit cards more often than not the
 
01:21:24.050 --> 01:21:24.060 align:start position:0%
business owners them cash simply because
 
01:21:27.050 --> 01:21:27.060 align:start position:0%
the credit card tips Etc are usually
 
01:21:28.910 --> 01:21:28.920 align:start position:0%
much greater than any cash they may have
 
01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:30.110 align:start position:0%
much greater than any cash they may have
received

01:21:30.110 --> 01:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
received
 
01:21:32.450 --> 01:21:32.460 align:start position:0%
um so hopefully that answers your
 
01:21:34.550 --> 01:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
question thank you yeah the employee at
 
01:21:36.229 --> 01:21:36.239 align:start position:0%
no point is paying for any of this this
 
01:21:38.390 --> 01:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
is just the reconciliation of the stuff
 
01:21:39.890 --> 01:21:39.900 align:start position:0%
they've collected from customers over
 
01:21:41.209 --> 01:21:41.219 align:start position:0%
the course of the night and they're
 
01:21:43.310 --> 01:21:43.320 align:start position:0%
remitting it to the business
 
01:21:46.250 --> 01:21:46.260 align:start position:0%
representative Schultz
 
01:21:50.870 --> 01:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
um so in this the way it's written and
 
01:21:52.550 --> 01:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
following up a little bit on his
 
01:21:52.560 --> 01:21:55.010 align:start position:0%
following up a little bit on his
question

01:21:55.010 --> 01:21:55.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:57.890 --> 01:21:57.900 align:start position:0%
what determines who
 
01:22:00.169 --> 01:22:00.179 align:start position:0%
belongs in each category is that the sub
 
01:22:03.649 --> 01:22:03.659 align:start position:0%
minimum wage worker or do they could
 
01:22:05.149 --> 01:22:05.159 align:start position:0%
they earn the regular
 
01:22:09.050 --> 01:22:09.060 align:start position:0%
minimum wage as a bus person I don't
 
01:22:11.990 --> 01:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
know I think yeah I'm actually going to
 
01:22:13.490 --> 01:22:13.500 align:start position:0%
defer some of the answer to your
 
01:22:18.050 --> 01:22:18.060 align:start position:0%
question to uh Ruby Ogden but ultimately
 
01:22:20.270 --> 01:22:20.280 align:start position:0%
if you are the way the statute's written
 
01:22:21.950 --> 01:22:21.960 align:start position:0%
if you are a directly tipped employee
 
01:22:24.410 --> 01:22:24.420 align:start position:0%
you are the server then you can be paid
 
01:22:26.390 --> 01:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
a sub minimum wage if you are not a
 
01:22:27.950 --> 01:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
directly tipped employee you have to be
 
01:22:29.810 --> 01:22:29.820 align:start position:0%
paid at least minimum wage
 
01:22:32.510 --> 01:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
so the busboy the food Runner the
 
01:22:34.130 --> 01:22:34.140 align:start position:0%
hostess everyone has to make at least
 
01:22:36.590 --> 01:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
minimum wage and then they may receive
 
01:22:38.209 --> 01:22:38.219 align:start position:0%
some tips but it's not guaranteed but
 
01:22:39.890 --> 01:22:39.900 align:start position:0%
they must be paid at least at minimum
 
01:22:39.900 --> 01:22:50.229 align:start position:0%
they must be paid at least at minimum
wage

01:22:50.229 --> 01:22:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:53.149 --> 01:22:53.159 align:start position:0%
thank you again Mr Summers so again with
 
01:22:55.790 --> 01:22:55.800 align:start position:0%
the with the uh the all the the bus boys
 
01:22:57.530 --> 01:22:57.540 align:start position:0%
and Runners and the and everybody else
 
01:22:59.630 --> 01:22:59.640 align:start position:0%
who's participating and likely to
 
01:23:02.990 --> 01:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
receive a tip from the as George do you
 
01:23:04.689 --> 01:23:04.699 align:start position:0%
look at that and say well do they get
 
01:23:07.430 --> 01:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
routinely thirty dollars in tips every
 
01:23:08.870 --> 01:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
month and now I don't have to pay the
 
01:23:12.169 --> 01:23:12.179 align:start position:0%
minimum wage no because uh if they are
 
01:23:14.689 --> 01:23:14.699 align:start position:0%
indirectly tipped AKA they may get may
 
01:23:17.270 --> 01:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
get a tip from an employee a server Etc
 
01:23:20.570 --> 01:23:20.580 align:start position:0%
it's required and I could uh Deputy
 
01:23:22.729 --> 01:23:22.739 align:start position:0%
Ogden can certainly speak to that thank
 
01:23:22.739 --> 01:23:24.709 align:start position:0%
Ogden can certainly speak to that thank
you

01:23:24.709 --> 01:23:24.719 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:23:27.229 --> 01:23:27.239 align:start position:0%
any further questions for Mr Summers
 
01:23:28.850 --> 01:23:28.860 align:start position:0%
representative love
 
01:23:30.410 --> 01:23:30.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:23:31.310 --> 01:23:31.320 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:23:34.310 --> 01:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
um well where are we here um
 
01:23:38.090 --> 01:23:38.100 align:start position:0%
on line 14 provided that the employer
 
01:23:40.370 --> 01:23:40.380 align:start position:0%
does not require our course employees to
 
01:23:42.290 --> 01:23:42.300 align:start position:0%
participate in tip pool and a tip
 
01:23:44.270 --> 01:23:44.280 align:start position:0%
sharing Arrangement
 
01:23:47.750 --> 01:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
um I uh I I go to a restaurant where it
 
01:23:50.090 --> 01:23:50.100 align:start position:0%
certainly seems like all the tips
 
01:23:52.669 --> 01:23:52.679 align:start position:0%
including credit card tips are put into
 
01:23:56.390 --> 01:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
a jar or you know that they're written
 
01:23:58.850 --> 01:23:58.860 align:start position:0%
down and at the end of the night it
 
01:24:01.550 --> 01:24:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:04.130 --> 01:24:04.140 align:start position:0%
um you know the the waitress the bus you
 
01:24:07.070 --> 01:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
know the the bartenders all all uh take
 
01:24:09.229 --> 01:24:09.239 align:start position:0%
from that pool uh
 
01:24:11.390 --> 01:24:11.400 align:start position:0%
this is saying that the the employer
 
01:24:13.490 --> 01:24:13.500 align:start position:0%
could not say upon hiring this is the
 
01:24:14.630 --> 01:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
way we do it
 
01:24:17.450 --> 01:24:17.460 align:start position:0%
uh if you agree to it you can work here
 
01:24:19.550 --> 01:24:19.560 align:start position:0%
if you don't I can't make separate
 
01:24:23.149 --> 01:24:23.159 align:start position:0%
arrangements for you uh no I I would not
 
01:24:24.890 --> 01:24:24.900 align:start position:0%
recommend any business to that the
 
01:24:26.030 --> 01:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor would frown
 
01:24:27.410 --> 01:24:27.420 align:start position:0%
seriously upon that and I would
 
01:24:30.169 --> 01:24:30.179 align:start position:0%
certainly uh urge Deputy Ogden to uh
 
01:24:32.689 --> 01:24:32.699 align:start position:0%
comment on that but ultimately
 
01:24:34.370 --> 01:24:34.380 align:start position:0%
um you know the perception may be that
 
01:24:35.750 --> 01:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
everything gets pulled but that's not
 
01:24:37.790 --> 01:24:37.800 align:start position:0%
really the actuality or how it actually
 
01:24:39.770 --> 01:24:39.780 align:start position:0%
works in the industry there are
 
01:24:41.570 --> 01:24:41.580 align:start position:0%
Exceptions there are some that operate
 
01:24:43.790 --> 01:24:43.800 align:start position:0%
that way because they're um they don't
 
01:24:45.410 --> 01:24:45.420 align:start position:0%
really have a signed section so
 
01:24:47.149 --> 01:24:47.159 align:start position:0%
everybody's in charge of everything at
 
01:24:49.610 --> 01:24:49.620 align:start position:0%
all times and in those situations it
 
01:24:51.709 --> 01:24:51.719 align:start position:0%
does there may be a scenario like that
 
01:24:54.169 --> 01:24:54.179 align:start position:0%
but those are kind of the uh exception
 
01:24:57.110 --> 01:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
rather than the rule uh more often if
 
01:25:00.050 --> 01:25:00.060 align:start position:0%
you have a sit-down restaurant where
 
01:25:01.729 --> 01:25:01.739 align:start position:0%
somebody takes your order and brings you
 
01:25:04.970 --> 01:25:04.980 align:start position:0%
drinks and food Etc most of the time and
 
01:25:07.910 --> 01:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
I would say 99 of the time maybe at
 
01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:08.570 align:start position:0%
I would say 99 of the time maybe at
least

01:25:08.570 --> 01:25:08.580 align:start position:0%
least
 
01:25:10.790 --> 01:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
um in almost all those situations that
 
01:25:12.830 --> 01:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
tip would belong to that server employee
 
01:25:14.930 --> 01:25:14.940 align:start position:0%
that has an assigned section and they
 
01:25:16.790 --> 01:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
may or may not share depending on you
 
01:25:18.050 --> 01:25:18.060 align:start position:0%
know how their night goes and that kind
 
01:25:19.310 --> 01:25:19.320 align:start position:0%
of thing
 
01:25:22.430 --> 01:25:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:25.070 --> 01:25:25.080 align:start position:0%
any further questions for Mr Summers
 
01:25:26.870 --> 01:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
I just have one
 
01:25:29.810 --> 01:25:29.820 align:start position:0%
on the service charge yes sir
 
01:25:32.149 --> 01:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
um typically that is a for like a party
 
01:25:34.729 --> 01:25:34.739 align:start position:0%
of eight or ten that's automatically
 
01:25:36.830 --> 01:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
um given an adjustment or somebody that
 
01:25:38.930 --> 01:25:38.940 align:start position:0%
requests a service charge for separate
 
01:25:40.790 --> 01:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
tickets for a party of 10.
 
01:25:43.850 --> 01:25:43.860 align:start position:0%
um with that Taken Out is it employers
 
01:25:45.530 --> 01:25:45.540 align:start position:0%
no longer allowed to ask for service
 
01:25:45.540 --> 01:25:47.290 align:start position:0%
no longer allowed to ask for service
charges

01:25:47.290 --> 01:25:47.300 align:start position:0%
charges
 
01:25:50.090 --> 01:25:50.100 align:start position:0%
so so you're looking at it purely
 
01:25:52.250 --> 01:25:52.260 align:start position:0%
through the lens of a restaurant a table
 
01:25:53.410 --> 01:25:53.420 align:start position:0%
service restaurant
 
01:25:56.510 --> 01:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
this also applies to the broader
 
01:25:58.850 --> 01:25:58.860 align:start position:0%
function facility right and so in some
 
01:26:01.129 --> 01:26:01.139 align:start position:0%
scenarios we have seen
 
01:26:02.570 --> 01:26:02.580 align:start position:0%
um let me ask you answer your question
 
01:26:05.390 --> 01:26:05.400 align:start position:0%
first so you could still use the term
 
01:26:07.070 --> 01:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
service charge and you could still give
 
01:26:09.110 --> 01:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
all of it to the employee that's
 
01:26:11.450 --> 01:26:11.460 align:start position:0%
entirely up to you we're not we're just
 
01:26:13.129 --> 01:26:13.139 align:start position:0%
not making it that it is required that
 
01:26:14.990 --> 01:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
that would be the case and what most
 
01:26:16.910 --> 01:26:16.920 align:start position:0%
restaurants will do and I think you
 
01:26:18.350 --> 01:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
would agree with this
 
01:26:20.090 --> 01:26:20.100 align:start position:0%
um they would put it in as a tip or a
 
01:26:20.100 --> 01:26:21.350 align:start position:0%
um they would put it in as a tip or a
gratuity

01:26:21.350 --> 01:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
gratuity
 
01:26:22.850 --> 01:26:22.860 align:start position:0%
um so that the customer knows that
 
01:26:24.709 --> 01:26:24.719 align:start position:0%
that's what it is but again you could
 
01:26:26.930 --> 01:26:26.940 align:start position:0%
certainly have a scenario where you use
 
01:26:28.850 --> 01:26:28.860 align:start position:0%
a service charge but again we've
 
01:26:30.229 --> 01:26:30.239 align:start position:0%
cautioned a lot of restaurants against
 
01:26:32.030 --> 01:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
using service charge because the IRS
 
01:26:34.189 --> 01:26:34.199 align:start position:0%
then considers it uh income of the
 
01:26:35.810 --> 01:26:35.820 align:start position:0%
business and therefore taxable so what
 
01:26:37.850 --> 01:26:37.860 align:start position:0%
we've said to folks is come up with
 
01:26:39.050 --> 01:26:39.060 align:start position:0%
another way to do it call it
 
01:26:40.910 --> 01:26:40.920 align:start position:0%
administrative fee whatever you want to
 
01:26:42.649 --> 01:26:42.659 align:start position:0%
call it so that you know it's still
 
01:26:44.810 --> 01:26:44.820 align:start position:0%
required to be paid by the uh by the
 
01:26:46.729 --> 01:26:46.739 align:start position:0%
customer and then you share that with
 
01:26:48.470 --> 01:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
your employees or however you want to do
 
01:26:50.450 --> 01:26:50.460 align:start position:0%
it but ultimately the term service
 
01:26:52.370 --> 01:26:52.380 align:start position:0%
charge is what became problematic when
 
01:26:53.810 --> 01:26:53.820 align:start position:0%
the IRS changed their determination
 
01:26:55.850 --> 01:26:55.860 align:start position:0%
number of years ago
 
01:26:57.709 --> 01:26:57.719 align:start position:0%
thank you for that clarification
 
01:27:01.070 --> 01:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
um and on the documenting agreed upon
 
01:27:03.709 --> 01:27:03.719 align:start position:0%
practice in section two yes
 
01:27:06.050 --> 01:27:06.060 align:start position:0%
um if you have a documented
 
01:27:08.689 --> 01:27:08.699 align:start position:0%
a practice with a number of wages with a
 
01:27:10.189 --> 01:27:10.199 align:start position:0%
number of employees that are operating
 
01:27:12.290 --> 01:27:12.300 align:start position:0%
in your facility and you have one
 
01:27:14.090 --> 01:27:14.100 align:start position:0%
employee in relations to representative
 
01:27:15.950 --> 01:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
Love's question a new employee coming in
 
01:27:19.129 --> 01:27:19.139 align:start position:0%
that doesn't want to go with that uh how
 
01:27:20.510 --> 01:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
does that work if there's already a
 
01:27:22.970 --> 01:27:22.980 align:start position:0%
documented agreement in place that the
 
01:27:24.590 --> 01:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
new employee is not going to follow that
 
01:27:26.990 --> 01:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
is that a violation if we don't hire
 
01:27:29.990 --> 01:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
them or is that a violation if they
 
01:27:31.430 --> 01:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
don't participate because there is an
 
01:27:33.590 --> 01:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
already an agreed upon practice for the
 
01:27:35.510 --> 01:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
employee employer so the agreed upon
 
01:27:37.310 --> 01:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
practice is not agreed upon because the
 
01:27:39.709 --> 01:27:39.719 align:start position:0%
employer dictated what the practice will
 
01:27:42.709 --> 01:27:42.719 align:start position:0%
be the agreed upon practice is what the
 
01:27:44.390 --> 01:27:44.400 align:start position:0%
employees themselves have said okay this
 
01:27:45.649 --> 01:27:45.659 align:start position:0%
is how we want to handle it within our
 
01:27:46.790 --> 01:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
business this is what we're all
 
01:27:48.110 --> 01:27:48.120 align:start position:0%
comfortable with this is what we want to
 
01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:48.890 align:start position:0%
comfortable with this is what we want to
do

01:27:48.890 --> 01:27:48.900 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:27:50.870 --> 01:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
with the caveat that they can still jump
 
01:27:52.930 --> 01:27:52.940 align:start position:0%
in and out of this agreement at any time
 
01:27:56.149 --> 01:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
by shift if they would like
 
01:27:58.370 --> 01:27:58.380 align:start position:0%
um part of where the and again I think
 
01:28:00.350 --> 01:28:00.360 align:start position:0%
the department has also said look we we
 
01:28:01.970 --> 01:28:01.980 align:start position:0%
agree with that that you could if you
 
01:28:03.410 --> 01:28:03.420 align:start position:0%
have a new employee coming in you can
 
01:28:05.570 --> 01:28:05.580 align:start position:0%
say this is how it's currently handed
 
01:28:07.189 --> 01:28:07.199 align:start position:0%
within the business handled within the
 
01:28:09.950 --> 01:28:09.960 align:start position:0%
business I think the department the
 
01:28:11.330 --> 01:28:11.340 align:start position:0%
employee can still say that they don't
 
01:28:12.590 --> 01:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
want to participate in that I think
 
01:28:13.850 --> 01:28:13.860 align:start position:0%
where the department would have a
 
01:28:15.470 --> 01:28:15.480 align:start position:0%
problem is if you did not hire them
 
01:28:16.970 --> 01:28:16.980 align:start position:0%
simply because they did not want to
 
01:28:18.590 --> 01:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
participate because now you get into
 
01:28:20.810 --> 01:28:20.820 align:start position:0%
that coercive environment so I think
 
01:28:22.790 --> 01:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
that we would not encourage any business
 
01:28:24.770 --> 01:28:24.780 align:start position:0%
to make hiring practices based upon what
 
01:28:26.330 --> 01:28:26.340 align:start position:0%
the employee wants to do
 
01:28:27.950 --> 01:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
participating in the pool or not because
 
01:28:29.270 --> 01:28:29.280 align:start position:0%
the employee
 
01:28:32.570 --> 01:28:32.580 align:start position:0%
at any time has has the uh the option to
 
01:28:35.030 --> 01:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
participate or not participate
 
01:28:37.490 --> 01:28:37.500 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions for Mr
 
01:28:37.500 --> 01:28:38.570 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions for Mr
Summers

01:28:38.570 --> 01:28:38.580 align:start position:0%
Summers
 
01:28:42.169 --> 01:28:42.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:44.810 --> 01:28:44.820 align:start position:0%
Mr Rady
 
01:28:54.470 --> 01:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:58.550 --> 01:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:00.470 --> 01:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
I'll be brief
 
01:29:02.270 --> 01:29:02.280 align:start position:0%
um I'm a management side attorney for
 
01:29:04.070 --> 01:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
the record my name is James Reedy it's
 
01:29:06.050 --> 01:29:06.060 align:start position:0%
she and Finney and
 
01:29:08.149 --> 01:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
um I'm in support of this bipartisan
 
01:29:10.970 --> 01:29:10.980 align:start position:0%
Bill I'm a management side lawyer
 
01:29:12.649 --> 01:29:12.659 align:start position:0%
meaning I represent employers of all
 
01:29:14.209 --> 01:29:14.219 align:start position:0%
shapes and sizes but I represent a
 
01:29:16.669 --> 01:29:16.679 align:start position:0%
number of businesses in the hospitality
 
01:29:19.910 --> 01:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
industry and I have dealt with this
 
01:29:21.950 --> 01:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
language this current language several
 
01:29:24.890 --> 01:29:24.900 align:start position:0%
times uh and it's already been been
 
01:29:26.870 --> 01:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
discussed by uh or outlined by Mr
 
01:29:29.810 --> 01:29:29.820 align:start position:0%
Summers and by the sponsor but it's
 
01:29:31.910 --> 01:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
effectively awkward language the
 
01:29:33.470 --> 01:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
employer can
 
01:29:35.450 --> 01:29:35.460 align:start position:0%
administer a policy the employer can
 
01:29:37.729 --> 01:29:37.739 align:start position:0%
have a policy administer the policy and
 
01:29:39.890 --> 01:29:39.900 align:start position:0%
deal with disputes and even assist with
 
01:29:41.470 --> 01:29:41.480 align:start position:0%
the distribution or apportionment
 
01:29:44.090 --> 01:29:44.100 align:start position:0%
directed by the employees but I can't
 
01:29:45.890 --> 01:29:45.900 align:start position:0%
discuss it in the first instance
 
01:29:47.810 --> 01:29:47.820 align:start position:0%
and this is hamstrung the Department of
 
01:29:49.850 --> 01:29:49.860 align:start position:0%
Labor in a few cases a few recent cases
 
01:29:51.709 --> 01:29:51.719 align:start position:0%
I've had where they say it has to be at
 
01:29:53.750 --> 01:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
the request of the employee
 
01:29:55.250 --> 01:29:55.260 align:start position:0%
and I don't know how many of you have
 
01:29:57.050 --> 01:29:57.060 align:start position:0%
ever worked in the industry but um
 
01:29:58.910 --> 01:29:58.920 align:start position:0%
imagine a server coming into a
 
01:30:00.050 --> 01:30:00.060 align:start position:0%
restaurant for the first time or coming
 
01:30:01.910 --> 01:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
into the busy summer season a lot of
 
01:30:03.770 --> 01:30:03.780 align:start position:0%
younger workers coming in and they
 
01:30:05.330 --> 01:30:05.340 align:start position:0%
wouldn't know enough about a tip pool or
 
01:30:06.470 --> 01:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
a tip share
 
01:30:09.169 --> 01:30:09.179 align:start position:0%
and what that means so unless they utter
 
01:30:11.930 --> 01:30:11.940 align:start position:0%
the magic words then the employer could
 
01:30:14.030 --> 01:30:14.040 align:start position:0%
not discuss it with them again the discu
 
01:30:16.370 --> 01:30:16.380 align:start position:0%
the employer can have a policy again
 
01:30:18.550 --> 01:30:18.560 align:start position:0%
proposed by the employees at some point
 
01:30:21.290 --> 01:30:21.300 align:start position:0%
administer it and deal with disputes and
 
01:30:22.790 --> 01:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
they can talk also talk about customary
 
01:30:25.370 --> 01:30:25.380 align:start position:0%
unusual amounts that could be shared
 
01:30:27.050 --> 01:30:27.060 align:start position:0%
but they can't mention in the first
 
01:30:28.910 --> 01:30:28.920 align:start position:0%
instance so this would take away that
 
01:30:30.470 --> 01:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
language but it preserves the intent of
 
01:30:32.030 --> 01:30:32.040 align:start position:0%
the statute which it has to be voluntary
 
01:30:35.270 --> 01:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
and to a question earlier the uh the
 
01:30:37.790 --> 01:30:37.800 align:start position:0%
server can withdraw on a daily basis I
 
01:30:40.189 --> 01:30:40.199 align:start position:0%
opt out today the census was low I
 
01:30:42.229 --> 01:30:42.239 align:start position:0%
didn't feel like I got assistance from
 
01:30:44.149 --> 01:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
others I choose not to it's a
 
01:30:46.129 --> 01:30:46.139 align:start position:0%
self-governing system effectively among
 
01:30:49.669 --> 01:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
the similarly situated employees
 
01:30:51.649 --> 01:30:51.659 align:start position:0%
and this would change it and preserve
 
01:30:55.729 --> 01:30:55.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:02.410 --> 01:31:02.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:04.790 --> 01:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie
 
01:31:07.850 --> 01:31:07.860 align:start position:0%
thank you for appearing appreciate it
 
01:31:07.860 --> 01:31:08.810 align:start position:0%
thank you for appearing appreciate it
um

01:31:08.810 --> 01:31:08.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:10.910 --> 01:31:10.920 align:start position:0%
I've I've worked with this issue for a
 
01:31:14.450 --> 01:31:14.460 align:start position:0%
long time from my days in the AFL-CIO
 
01:31:16.330 --> 01:31:16.340 align:start position:0%
um and one of the things that's always
 
01:31:19.910 --> 01:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
I'm always interested in is the issue of
 
01:31:23.870 --> 01:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
uh not coercing employees
 
01:31:25.910 --> 01:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
um and I understand workplaces have been
 
01:31:27.530 --> 01:31:27.540 align:start position:0%
in a lot of them negotiated a lot of
 
01:31:29.390 --> 01:31:29.400 align:start position:0%
contracts over the course of the years
 
01:31:30.950 --> 01:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
in this case you have a bunch of
 
01:31:35.570 --> 01:31:35.580 align:start position:0%
employees in a restaurant and you you
 
01:31:39.470 --> 01:31:39.480 align:start position:0%
are giving them the opportunity to to
 
01:31:42.590 --> 01:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
exercise their own uh decision about
 
01:31:44.810 --> 01:31:44.820 align:start position:0%
what they think is best for them
 
01:31:48.110 --> 01:31:48.120 align:start position:0%
and there is no coercion that goes on
 
01:31:50.390 --> 01:31:50.400 align:start position:0%
and yet there's nothing in this that
 
01:31:52.129 --> 01:31:52.139 align:start position:0%
that says
 
01:31:54.229 --> 01:31:54.239 align:start position:0%
um that there's when the employer
 
01:31:55.870 --> 01:31:55.880 align:start position:0%
violates that
 
01:31:58.790 --> 01:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
there's no there's no fine unless there
 
01:32:00.530 --> 01:32:00.540 align:start position:0%
may be something that the commissioner
 
01:32:02.090 --> 01:32:02.100 align:start position:0%
will bring forward
 
01:32:05.090 --> 01:32:05.100 align:start position:0%
so when you look at that Dynamic do you
 
01:32:07.070 --> 01:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
have any comments about that Dynamic
 
01:32:08.570 --> 01:32:08.580 align:start position:0%
you've got the owner and you've got an
 
01:32:10.790 --> 01:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
employee you've got somebody that wants
 
01:32:12.410 --> 01:32:12.420 align:start position:0%
to participate somebody doesn't do you
 
01:32:14.270 --> 01:32:14.280 align:start position:0%
have any comments about that I do be and
 
01:32:15.770 --> 01:32:15.780 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question I I've had
 
01:32:18.110 --> 01:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
that case a number of times and so the
 
01:32:20.450 --> 01:32:20.460 align:start position:0%
statute provides that the the employer
 
01:32:23.810 --> 01:32:23.820 align:start position:0%
Can it can help to mediate or resolve
 
01:32:26.450 --> 01:32:26.460 align:start position:0%
disputes this happens all the time when
 
01:32:28.850 --> 01:32:28.860 align:start position:0%
someone is tipping out pretty regularly
 
01:32:30.830 --> 01:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
sharing the tips with similarly situated
 
01:32:32.570 --> 01:32:32.580 align:start position:0%
employees I'm sorry pooling with
 
01:32:34.129 --> 01:32:34.139 align:start position:0%
similarly situated employees or sharing
 
01:32:35.870 --> 01:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
with non-tipped employees and then
 
01:32:38.209 --> 01:32:38.219 align:start position:0%
someone who's not tipping out for
 
01:32:40.010 --> 01:32:40.020 align:start position:0%
whatever reason on any particular day or
 
01:32:43.189 --> 01:32:43.199 align:start position:0%
just in perpetuity and that generally
 
01:32:45.770 --> 01:32:45.780 align:start position:0%
speaking is settled between the staff
 
01:32:47.990 --> 01:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
and like I said it's a self-governing
 
01:32:50.450 --> 01:32:50.460 align:start position:0%
system because if you're sharing tips
 
01:32:53.629 --> 01:32:53.639 align:start position:0%
with an expediter a busser a Hostess and
 
01:32:56.270 --> 01:32:56.280 align:start position:0%
so on they're likely to get better uh
 
01:32:57.709 --> 01:32:57.719 align:start position:0%
better service from those individuals
 
01:33:00.530 --> 01:33:00.540 align:start position:0%
and all all boats rise with the tide but
 
01:33:02.450 --> 01:33:02.460 align:start position:0%
to your question with regard to can and
 
01:33:04.850 --> 01:33:04.860 align:start position:0%
the employer coerce and pressure and say
 
01:33:06.290 --> 01:33:06.300 align:start position:0%
well this is our policy and if you don't
 
01:33:08.390 --> 01:33:08.400 align:start position:0%
cooperate things are likely to go bad
 
01:33:10.070 --> 01:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
well that would likely be a violation of
 
01:33:11.450 --> 01:33:11.460 align:start position:0%
the statute and that's when the
 
01:33:12.590 --> 01:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor would get involved
 
01:33:14.030 --> 01:33:14.040 align:start position:0%
and when does that typically happen a
 
01:33:16.430 --> 01:33:16.440 align:start position:0%
disgruntled employee says I was forced
 
01:33:19.430 --> 01:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
or coerced or was in a system whereby I
 
01:33:20.990 --> 01:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
was pressured to tip and I didn't want
 
01:33:22.669 --> 01:33:22.679 align:start position:0%
to and then they file a complaint with
 
01:33:25.090 --> 01:33:25.100 align:start position:0%
the Department of Labor
 
01:33:28.370 --> 01:33:28.380 align:start position:0%
just for the final question oh
 
01:33:30.770 --> 01:33:30.780 align:start position:0%
so the idea that the that the employer
 
01:33:34.010 --> 01:33:34.020 align:start position:0%
is the one that mediates the dispute
 
01:33:36.410 --> 01:33:36.420 align:start position:0%
do you see that as as problematic in any
 
01:33:38.689 --> 01:33:38.699 align:start position:0%
way in that that's not exactly a neutral
 
01:33:41.090 --> 01:33:41.100 align:start position:0%
that's negotiating in the end is those
 
01:33:42.950 --> 01:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
are reasons why many times they end up
 
01:33:44.330 --> 01:33:44.340 align:start position:0%
with the DOL
 
01:33:46.370 --> 01:33:46.380 align:start position:0%
uh thanks for and I think that's a good
 
01:33:48.110 --> 01:33:48.120 align:start position:0%
question it's a practical question I
 
01:33:49.970 --> 01:33:49.980 align:start position:0%
think the bottom line is what's the
 
01:33:52.370 --> 01:33:52.380 align:start position:0%
what's the purpose of uh running
 
01:33:54.050 --> 01:33:54.060 align:start position:0%
whatever the business is let's say it's
 
01:33:56.930 --> 01:33:56.940 align:start position:0%
a restaurant it's to provide that prompt
 
01:33:58.370 --> 01:33:58.380 align:start position:0%
service that quality service to its
 
01:34:00.709 --> 01:34:00.719 align:start position:0%
customers and it doesn't do well if its
 
01:34:02.149 --> 01:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
employees are not getting along so it
 
01:34:03.830 --> 01:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
wants to preserve the piece if at all
 
01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:04.970 align:start position:0%
wants to preserve the piece if at all
possible

01:34:04.970 --> 01:34:04.980 align:start position:0%
possible
 
01:34:07.910 --> 01:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
um my experience with customers is with
 
01:34:11.570 --> 01:34:11.580 align:start position:0%
employers is they try to be right down
 
01:34:12.890 --> 01:34:12.900 align:start position:0%
the middle in that regard which is look
 
01:34:14.930 --> 01:34:14.940 align:start position:0%
I don't care how you divide it you can
 
01:34:16.729 --> 01:34:16.739 align:start position:0%
tip out whatever percentage you want to
 
01:34:18.290 --> 01:34:18.300 align:start position:0%
and that's the other thing as long as
 
01:34:20.629 --> 01:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
you're above the the minimum wage sub
 
01:34:22.490 --> 01:34:22.500 align:start position:0%
minimum wage plus tips above the minimum
 
01:34:24.410 --> 01:34:24.420 align:start position:0%
wage you can do whatever you want or not
 
01:34:26.629 --> 01:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
and some are more generous than not just
 
01:34:29.149 --> 01:34:29.159 align:start position:0%
this most people have been tipping over
 
01:34:31.850 --> 01:34:31.860 align:start position:0%
the last couple of years especially but
 
01:34:34.070 --> 01:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
um the the interest of the employer in
 
01:34:36.649 --> 01:34:36.659 align:start position:0%
that regard is not the tip system but
 
01:34:37.970 --> 01:34:37.980 align:start position:0%
instead maintain the peace and the
 
01:34:44.149 --> 01:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:47.570 --> 01:34:47.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:50.030 --> 01:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr thank you
 
01:35:01.490 --> 01:35:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:03.530 --> 01:35:03.540 align:start position:0%
thank you everybody Ogden New Hampshire
 
01:35:05.450 --> 01:35:05.460 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor I'm happy to take
 
01:35:07.430 --> 01:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
any questions but I'd start by answering
 
01:35:08.810 --> 01:35:08.820 align:start position:0%
some of the questions that have already
 
01:35:10.790 --> 01:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
come up specifically representative love
 
01:35:14.510 --> 01:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
your uh question relative to essentially
 
01:35:16.850 --> 01:35:16.860 align:start position:0%
employees at time of interview being
 
01:35:20.330 --> 01:35:20.340 align:start position:0%
told this is how we do it and that's uh
 
01:35:22.430 --> 01:35:22.440 align:start position:0%
basically needed for someone to get a
 
01:35:24.770 --> 01:35:24.780 align:start position:0%
job the department would take that as
 
01:35:26.810 --> 01:35:26.820 align:start position:0%
coercive specifically we would look at
 
01:35:28.790 --> 01:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
such a scenario and imagine the impact
 
01:35:31.370 --> 01:35:31.380 align:start position:0%
that that would have on the existing
 
01:35:33.350 --> 01:35:33.360 align:start position:0%
staff so if again you look at a system
 
01:35:36.050 --> 01:35:36.060 align:start position:0%
where an employer says this is how we do
 
01:35:38.870 --> 01:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
it if you want to work here this is how
 
01:35:42.729 --> 01:35:42.739 align:start position:0%
it's done we would view that as coercive
 
01:35:45.410 --> 01:35:45.420 align:start position:0%
and representative McKenzie in terms of
 
01:35:47.870 --> 01:35:47.880 align:start position:0%
your question or comments relative to
 
01:35:50.450 --> 01:35:50.460 align:start position:0%
coercion it unfortunately does come up
 
01:35:53.689 --> 01:35:53.699 align:start position:0%
the statute 279 one actually gives a
 
01:35:55.790 --> 01:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
definition of coercion in this context
 
01:35:58.729 --> 01:35:58.739 align:start position:0%
and it says it's an instance in which an
 
01:36:01.430 --> 01:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
adverse employment action is taken
 
01:36:03.590 --> 01:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
against an employee relative to their
 
01:36:05.510 --> 01:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
decision to tip or not tip or anything
 
01:36:08.689 --> 01:36:08.699 align:start position:0%
of that nature in terms of what the the
 
01:36:11.030 --> 01:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
liability or issues related to such
 
01:36:13.189 --> 01:36:13.199 align:start position:0%
complaints uh the department when we
 
01:36:15.350 --> 01:36:15.360 align:start position:0%
deal with those findings we essentially
 
01:36:17.330 --> 01:36:17.340 align:start position:0%
there's a wage adjustment where if we
 
01:36:19.189 --> 01:36:19.199 align:start position:0%
come in and we see that there has been
 
01:36:21.530 --> 01:36:21.540 align:start position:0%
coercion we would say that all of the
 
01:36:23.030 --> 01:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
monies that have been funneled through
 
01:36:26.209 --> 01:36:26.219 align:start position:0%
that share or pool and I would Echo Mr
 
01:36:27.770 --> 01:36:27.780 align:start position:0%
Summer's comments that most typically
 
01:36:30.169 --> 01:36:30.179 align:start position:0%
we're seeing shares as opposed to pools
 
01:36:32.629 --> 01:36:32.639 align:start position:0%
but we would say that any money is being
 
01:36:35.390 --> 01:36:35.400 align:start position:0%
funneled through an involuntarily or a
 
01:36:38.390 --> 01:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
coerced share or pool would be a subject
 
01:36:40.250 --> 01:36:40.260 align:start position:0%
to a wage adjustment where we would then
 
01:36:42.169 --> 01:36:42.179 align:start position:0%
redistribute we'd say to the employer
 
01:36:44.750 --> 01:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
you have to pay back all of the
 
01:36:46.910 --> 01:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
employees all of that money those are
 
01:36:49.250 --> 01:36:49.260 align:start position:0%
actually very significant when we do a
 
01:36:51.169 --> 01:36:51.179 align:start position:0%
wage adjustment and you go back a year
 
01:36:52.790 --> 01:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
those adjustments usually are pretty
 
01:36:54.830 --> 01:36:54.840 align:start position:0%
significant in addition to the wage
 
01:36:56.450 --> 01:36:56.460 align:start position:0%
adjustment there would be penalties
 
01:36:59.090 --> 01:36:59.100 align:start position:0%
again we do see coercion at times I'd
 
01:37:01.129 --> 01:37:01.139 align:start position:0%
Echo Mr reedy's comments that most often
 
01:37:04.129 --> 01:37:04.139 align:start position:0%
I think all employers are usually well
 
01:37:05.570 --> 01:37:05.580 align:start position:0%
intentioned and they're usually looking
 
01:37:07.669 --> 01:37:07.679 align:start position:0%
to maintain peace but we have certainly
 
01:37:09.470 --> 01:37:09.480 align:start position:0%
come across instances in which there
 
01:37:11.629 --> 01:37:11.639 align:start position:0%
have been a coercive environment again
 
01:37:13.310 --> 01:37:13.320 align:start position:0%
someone saying you can't work here
 
01:37:15.110 --> 01:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
unless you do that someone's saying do
 
01:37:16.490 --> 01:37:16.500 align:start position:0%
this at the end of the shift and then
 
01:37:17.990 --> 01:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
the person says they don't want to and
 
01:37:19.550 --> 01:37:19.560 align:start position:0%
then they get called again and they said
 
01:37:21.649 --> 01:37:21.659 align:start position:0%
you're sure you don't want to so we we
 
01:37:24.530 --> 01:37:24.540 align:start position:0%
do come across that I would say that the
 
01:37:27.229 --> 01:37:27.239 align:start position:0%
language put forth here I do thank the
 
01:37:29.450 --> 01:37:29.460 align:start position:0%
hospitality folks for having provided us
 
01:37:31.250 --> 01:37:31.260 align:start position:0%
with the language and opportunity to
 
01:37:32.810 --> 01:37:32.820 align:start position:0%
work with them on on some of the
 
01:37:35.270 --> 01:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
language we do view this language as
 
01:37:38.149 --> 01:37:38.159 align:start position:0%
maintaining the intent mainly or mainly
 
01:37:40.669 --> 01:37:40.679 align:start position:0%
that there would be still this notion
 
01:37:43.490 --> 01:37:43.500 align:start position:0%
that it has to be voluntary and cannot
 
01:37:45.709 --> 01:37:45.719 align:start position:0%
be coerced the only other question I'm
 
01:37:47.750 --> 01:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
remembering off the top of my head uh
 
01:37:49.729 --> 01:37:49.739 align:start position:0%
representative Cahill you had made the
 
01:37:51.950 --> 01:37:51.960 align:start position:0%
comment about how something would be
 
01:37:54.950 --> 01:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
designated service charge if
 
01:37:58.010 --> 01:37:58.020 align:start position:0%
an employer looked at this change and
 
01:37:59.810 --> 01:37:59.820 align:start position:0%
said we are no longer going to be
 
01:38:01.970 --> 01:38:01.980 align:start position:0%
providing service charges
 
01:38:04.129 --> 01:38:04.139 align:start position:0%
to those employees the one thing we
 
01:38:05.810 --> 01:38:05.820 align:start position:0%
would look at is we'd say okay those are
 
01:38:08.090 --> 01:38:08.100 align:start position:0%
no longer directly tipped employees so
 
01:38:09.770 --> 01:38:09.780 align:start position:0%
they're they would no longer be subject
 
01:38:11.689 --> 01:38:11.699 align:start position:0%
to a sub minimum wage or anything like
 
01:38:13.790 --> 01:38:13.800 align:start position:0%
that so I just want to be clear that if
 
01:38:16.149 --> 01:38:16.159 align:start position:0%
an employer is not giving the tips over
 
01:38:18.890 --> 01:38:18.900 align:start position:0%
then that employee is no longer directly
 
01:38:21.110 --> 01:38:21.120 align:start position:0%
tipped so again that would result in a
 
01:38:23.629 --> 01:38:23.639 align:start position:0%
change and I do uh recognize Mr Summer's
 
01:38:25.790 --> 01:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
comments that yes we have come across
 
01:38:28.310 --> 01:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
instances in which the service charge is
 
01:38:29.990 --> 01:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
being held against the employer and
 
01:38:32.990 --> 01:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
they're being taxed upon it by the IRS
 
01:38:34.850 --> 01:38:34.860 align:start position:0%
so it has an issue that has come up from
 
01:38:36.110 --> 01:38:36.120 align:start position:0%
time to time
 
01:38:38.810 --> 01:38:38.820 align:start position:0%
so I'm happy to take any questions
 
01:38:42.410 --> 01:38:42.420 align:start position:0%
for a Deputy Commissioner Ogden
 
01:38:45.709 --> 01:38:45.719 align:start position:0%
uh representative colcum
 
01:38:47.930 --> 01:38:47.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you um
 
01:38:50.870 --> 01:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner I'd like to visit
 
01:38:52.850 --> 01:38:52.860 align:start position:0%
this service charge versus TIP
 
01:38:56.090 --> 01:38:56.100 align:start position:0%
ingratuity my understanding is a service
 
01:38:57.470 --> 01:38:57.480 align:start position:0%
charge is something that I would be
 
01:39:00.410 --> 01:39:00.420 align:start position:0%
required to pay where typic gratuity is
 
01:39:01.790 --> 01:39:01.800 align:start position:0%
something that I can do at my own
 
01:39:01.800 --> 01:39:02.990 align:start position:0%
something that I can do at my own
discretion

01:39:02.990 --> 01:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
discretion
 
01:39:07.010 --> 01:39:07.020 align:start position:0%
so if a service charge is put on a bill
 
01:39:07.020 --> 01:39:08.570 align:start position:0%
so if a service charge is put on a bill
then

01:39:08.570 --> 01:39:08.580 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:39:10.729 --> 01:39:10.739 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be the income to the
 
01:39:13.970 --> 01:39:13.980 align:start position:0%
employer and not uh and then basically
 
01:39:16.430 --> 01:39:16.440 align:start position:0%
an expense back to an employee if that's
 
01:39:17.870 --> 01:39:17.880 align:start position:0%
the way that they were choosing to
 
01:39:19.430 --> 01:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
distribute it
 
01:39:21.709 --> 01:39:21.719 align:start position:0%
so two things I would say there there
 
01:39:23.390 --> 01:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
are I think times in which particular
 
01:39:24.890 --> 01:39:24.900 align:start position:0%
employers have used the term
 
01:39:26.930 --> 01:39:26.940 align:start position:0%
synonymously I would agree with you that
 
01:39:28.910 --> 01:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
in a general sense a service charge is
 
01:39:31.070 --> 01:39:31.080 align:start position:0%
usually a specified amount or a
 
01:39:33.350 --> 01:39:33.360 align:start position:0%
specified percentage I do think and I'm
 
01:39:35.510 --> 01:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
not an IRS expert but I do think that is
 
01:39:37.910 --> 01:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
why the IRS has probably characterized
 
01:39:39.590 --> 01:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
it differently and they did make that
 
01:39:41.149 --> 01:39:41.159 align:start position:0%
change so I don't know that I'm
 
01:39:42.830 --> 01:39:42.840 align:start position:0%
answering your question but I would say
 
01:39:42.840 --> 01:39:44.149 align:start position:0%
answering your question but I would say
that

01:39:44.149 --> 01:39:44.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:39:46.610 --> 01:39:46.620 align:start position:0%
um yes generally service charges are a
 
01:39:49.010 --> 01:39:49.020 align:start position:0%
specified amount I do think that is why
 
01:39:51.470 --> 01:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
it's looked at is less speculative than
 
01:39:53.229 --> 01:39:53.239 align:start position:0%
a gratuity and it's directly
 
01:39:55.550 --> 01:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
characterizes income to the business I
 
01:40:00.770 --> 01:40:00.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:02.390 --> 01:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie
 
01:40:04.729 --> 01:40:04.739 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:40:04.739 --> 01:40:06.290 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
uh

01:40:06.290 --> 01:40:06.300 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:40:09.950 --> 01:40:09.960 align:start position:0%
where is this uh where is this noticed
 
01:40:12.290 --> 01:40:12.300 align:start position:0%
in uh in restaurants is a requirement
 
01:40:15.410 --> 01:40:15.420 align:start position:0%
that that there'd be some posting of the
 
01:40:18.590 --> 01:40:18.600 align:start position:0%
law as it relates to tip pooling and tip
 
01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:19.490 align:start position:0%
law as it relates to tip pooling and tip
sharing

01:40:19.490 --> 01:40:19.500 align:start position:0%
sharing
 
01:40:21.830 --> 01:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
so there is requirements related to the
 
01:40:25.550 --> 01:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
posting for minimum wage but no there's
 
01:40:27.229 --> 01:40:27.239 align:start position:0%
not a specific requirement I believe
 
01:40:30.290 --> 01:40:30.300 align:start position:0%
that the tip pooling statute 26b I don't
 
01:40:32.149 --> 01:40:32.159 align:start position:0%
I there is not a specific requirement
 
01:40:34.669 --> 01:40:34.679 align:start position:0%
that that be individually posted thank
 
01:40:34.679 --> 01:40:36.530 align:start position:0%
that that be individually posted thank
you

01:40:36.530 --> 01:40:36.540 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:40:36.540 --> 01:40:39.890 align:start position:0%
you
huh

01:40:39.890 --> 01:40:39.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:42.110 --> 01:40:42.120 align:start position:0%
any further questions for Deputy
 
01:40:43.790 --> 01:40:43.800 align:start position:0%
Commissioner Ogden
 
01:40:47.270 --> 01:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:47.930 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:40:47.930 --> 01:40:47.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:49.970 --> 01:40:49.980 align:start position:0%
why are we changing this now since it
 
01:40:54.169 --> 01:40:54.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:55.610 --> 01:40:55.620 align:start position:0%
speak for them but I think the
 
01:40:57.530 --> 01:40:57.540 align:start position:0%
hospitality industry came forward in
 
01:41:00.470 --> 01:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
this instance because we have had a
 
01:41:02.810 --> 01:41:02.820 align:start position:0%
couple of uh cases over the course of
 
01:41:04.850 --> 01:41:04.860 align:start position:0%
the last year where this specific issue
 
01:41:07.070 --> 01:41:07.080 align:start position:0%
when I say this specific issue this idea
 
01:41:07.080 --> 01:41:08.090 align:start position:0%
when I say this specific issue this idea
of

01:41:08.090 --> 01:41:08.100 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:41:11.209 --> 01:41:11.219 align:start position:0%
an employer there was some question
 
01:41:14.209 --> 01:41:14.219 align:start position:0%
about when or if it came up and in the
 
01:41:16.010 --> 01:41:16.020 align:start position:0%
context of working through those cases
 
01:41:17.990 --> 01:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
the department was asked well are you
 
01:41:20.750 --> 01:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
saying it would be a violation just if
 
01:41:23.570 --> 01:41:23.580 align:start position:0%
the employee or brought the idea up and
 
01:41:27.050 --> 01:41:27.060 align:start position:0%
it wasn't coercive and being very candid
 
01:41:30.470 --> 01:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
my answer was that if you look at the
 
01:41:32.450 --> 01:41:32.460 align:start position:0%
way the language is crafted now an
 
01:41:35.149 --> 01:41:35.159 align:start position:0%
employer bringing it up first would be
 
01:41:37.189 --> 01:41:37.199 align:start position:0%
or should be seen as or could be seen as
 
01:41:39.830 --> 01:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
a violation of that law I don't believe
 
01:41:41.629 --> 01:41:41.639 align:start position:0%
that was the intent of this I do think
 
01:41:42.770 --> 01:41:42.780 align:start position:0%
and I hope that the department
 
01:41:44.870 --> 01:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
undertaking these cases has always paid
 
01:41:46.550 --> 01:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
more attention to whether there's been
 
01:41:48.590 --> 01:41:48.600 align:start position:0%
coercion or not but if we're we're
 
01:41:50.390 --> 01:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
speaking plainly and being candid the
 
01:41:52.669 --> 01:41:52.679 align:start position:0%
way the law is presently crafted an
 
01:41:54.950 --> 01:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
employer bringing up the concept first
 
01:41:57.709 --> 01:41:57.719 align:start position:0%
without being prompted by the employee
 
01:42:00.350 --> 01:42:00.360 align:start position:0%
that would be could be cited as a
 
01:42:02.450 --> 01:42:02.460 align:start position:0%
violation so I believe again I don't
 
01:42:03.590 --> 01:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
mean to speak for them but I believe
 
01:42:06.050 --> 01:42:06.060 align:start position:0%
that has come up we had that discussion
 
01:42:07.850 --> 01:42:07.860 align:start position:0%
and I think that was the impetus for
 
01:42:09.709 --> 01:42:09.719 align:start position:0%
saying well we want to clarify the
 
01:42:09.719 --> 01:42:13.010 align:start position:0%
saying well we want to clarify the
language

01:42:13.010 --> 01:42:13.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:15.109 --> 01:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
I understand that part of it um and
 
01:42:17.149 --> 01:42:17.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for clarifying um the other
 
01:42:18.590 --> 01:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
part of it is if you're in a large
 
01:42:18.600 --> 01:42:19.790 align:start position:0%
part of it is if you're in a large
corporation

01:42:19.790 --> 01:42:19.800 align:start position:0%
corporation
 
01:42:22.609 --> 01:42:22.619 align:start position:0%
and um let's say it's the front of the
 
01:42:24.530 --> 01:42:24.540 align:start position:0%
house manager is doing the interviews
 
01:42:26.750 --> 01:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
would they be considered the employer if
 
01:42:29.090 --> 01:42:29.100 align:start position:0%
they mention that they have uh tip
 
01:42:31.250 --> 01:42:31.260 align:start position:0%
sharing or tip pooling there again
 
01:42:33.229 --> 01:42:33.239 align:start position:0%
whoever the employers yeah in that
 
01:42:34.729 --> 01:42:34.739 align:start position:0%
context I believe that it would be
 
01:42:36.590 --> 01:42:36.600 align:start position:0%
looked at is that that person would be
 
01:42:39.470 --> 01:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
the would be the employer yes
 
01:42:41.510 --> 01:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:42:45.649 --> 01:42:45.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:48.050 --> 01:42:48.060 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm curious
 
01:42:48.060 --> 01:42:48.649 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm curious
um

01:42:48.649 --> 01:42:48.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:50.810 --> 01:42:50.820 align:start position:0%
tipping seems to have expanded quite a
 
01:42:52.609 --> 01:42:52.619 align:start position:0%
bit and we talk a lot about the sub
 
01:42:54.530 --> 01:42:54.540 align:start position:0%
minimum wage and this is specific to sub
 
01:42:55.850 --> 01:42:55.860 align:start position:0%
minimum wage
 
01:42:58.250 --> 01:42:58.260 align:start position:0%
but when you go into other stores that
 
01:42:58.260 --> 01:42:59.270 align:start position:0%
but when you go into other stores that
are

01:42:59.270 --> 01:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:43:01.129 --> 01:43:01.139 align:start position:0%
not perceived to be restaurants and
 
01:43:03.350 --> 01:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
there's a tip jar there
 
01:43:05.870 --> 01:43:05.880 align:start position:0%
um is there any regulation as to how
 
01:43:08.330 --> 01:43:08.340 align:start position:0%
those tips are handled are can those be
 
01:43:10.310 --> 01:43:10.320 align:start position:0%
pooled or does that not fall into any of
 
01:43:11.810 --> 01:43:11.820 align:start position:0%
this and they can be handled under any
 
01:43:14.030 --> 01:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
way they want no the issue there and I
 
01:43:15.770 --> 01:43:15.780 align:start position:0%
believe Mr summer spoke to this when you
 
01:43:18.770 --> 01:43:18.780 align:start position:0%
have an environment like a
 
01:43:21.709 --> 01:43:21.719 align:start position:0%
and Dunkin Donuts but when you have an
 
01:43:24.350 --> 01:43:24.360 align:start position:0%
environment when there is a jar out and
 
01:43:26.030 --> 01:43:26.040 align:start position:0%
and people are using that to put
 
01:43:27.830 --> 01:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
gratuities in it we would ultimately
 
01:43:29.689 --> 01:43:29.699 align:start position:0%
look at that and say okay who does that
 
01:43:32.510 --> 01:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
tip belong to I think in practice most
 
01:43:34.609 --> 01:43:34.619 align:start position:0%
often those are looked at as pools
 
01:43:37.030 --> 01:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
because it would be impossible to say
 
01:43:39.590 --> 01:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
you know who owns what percentage or
 
01:43:42.290 --> 01:43:42.300 align:start position:0%
portion of that when I talk to employers
 
01:43:44.270 --> 01:43:44.280 align:start position:0%
about that particular scenario I would
 
01:43:46.430 --> 01:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
say yes in practice that is probably
 
01:43:48.770 --> 01:43:48.780 align:start position:0%
going to be treated as a pool but if you
 
01:43:52.010 --> 01:43:52.020 align:start position:0%
have a particular employee who says no I
 
01:43:54.410 --> 01:43:54.420 align:start position:0%
know that that ten dollars was thrown in
 
01:43:56.229 --> 01:43:56.239 align:start position:0%
for me
 
01:43:58.729 --> 01:43:58.739 align:start position:0%
arguably they could bring a wage claim
 
01:44:00.470 --> 01:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
of some type that would not be something
 
01:44:02.510 --> 01:44:02.520 align:start position:0%
the department would pursue because
 
01:44:04.910 --> 01:44:04.920 align:start position:0%
again we would look at a tip jar
 
01:44:07.430 --> 01:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
difficult to trace ownership to we would
 
01:44:09.890 --> 01:44:09.900 align:start position:0%
look at that in practice as a pool but I
 
01:44:12.229 --> 01:44:12.239 align:start position:0%
would advise employers a particular
 
01:44:14.570 --> 01:44:14.580 align:start position:0%
employee or particular employees could
 
01:44:16.669 --> 01:44:16.679 align:start position:0%
try and assert individual ownership over
 
01:44:18.770 --> 01:44:18.780 align:start position:0%
the gratuity so apologies for if I'm
 
01:44:20.570 --> 01:44:20.580 align:start position:0%
rambling on and on but I would say in
 
01:44:24.590 --> 01:44:24.600 align:start position:0%
short we would say that tips are tips if
 
01:44:27.470 --> 01:44:27.480 align:start position:0%
it's a tip it belongs to the employees
 
01:44:29.270 --> 01:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
who perform the service and the
 
01:44:30.770 --> 01:44:30.780 align:start position:0%
environment you're talking about it's
 
01:44:32.689 --> 01:44:32.699 align:start position:0%
sometimes difficult to trace who owns
 
01:44:34.970 --> 01:44:34.980 align:start position:0%
what portion we would probably see that
 
01:44:39.169 --> 01:44:39.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:40.970 --> 01:44:40.980 align:start position:0%
so then it doesn't matter that that
 
01:44:42.890 --> 01:44:42.900 align:start position:0%
employee is not a sub-minimum wage
 
01:44:45.709 --> 01:44:45.719 align:start position:0%
employee no you could have um you could
 
01:44:48.350 --> 01:44:48.360 align:start position:0%
have an employer an employer decide that
 
01:44:50.930 --> 01:44:50.940 align:start position:0%
they want and we do have some um and Mr
 
01:44:52.669 --> 01:44:52.679 align:start position:0%
Summers can speak to this as well we do
 
01:44:55.370 --> 01:44:55.380 align:start position:0%
have employers who pay uh directly
 
01:44:57.410 --> 01:44:57.420 align:start position:0%
tipped employees in excess of minimum
 
01:44:59.750 --> 01:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
wage they they do do that it's what
 
01:45:02.149 --> 01:45:02.159 align:start position:0%
determines uh if they get the tip it's
 
01:45:02.159 --> 01:45:03.169 align:start position:0%
determines uh if they get the tip it's
theirs

01:45:03.169 --> 01:45:03.179 align:start position:0%
theirs
 
01:45:08.149 --> 01:45:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:09.830 --> 01:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
any further questions for the Deputy
 
01:45:09.840 --> 01:45:13.430 align:start position:0%
any further questions for the Deputy
Commissioner

01:45:13.430 --> 01:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:15.530 --> 01:45:15.540 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
01:45:18.890 --> 01:45:18.900 align:start position:0%
can we get the blue sheet and the online
 
01:45:20.510 --> 01:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
um things I think representative
 
01:45:22.430 --> 01:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
seaworth will take care of that
 
01:45:45.649 --> 01:45:45.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:49.010 --> 01:45:49.020 align:start position:0%
so we had no one sign in in person
 
01:45:51.729 --> 01:45:51.739 align:start position:0%
um on the blue sheet online there was
 
01:45:55.129 --> 01:45:55.139 align:start position:0%
one single sign-in in opposition to the
 
01:45:59.570 --> 01:45:59.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:02.169 --> 01:46:02.179 align:start position:0%
next up
 
01:46:06.109 --> 01:46:06.119 align:start position:0%
uh I will open the hearing on SB 46
 
01:46:08.330 --> 01:46:08.340 align:start position:0%
relative to electronic payments to
 
01:46:11.689 --> 01:46:11.699 align:start position:0%
employee debit cards I have
 
01:46:11.699 --> 01:46:12.830 align:start position:0%
employee debit cards I have
um

01:46:12.830 --> 01:46:12.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:14.990 --> 01:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
one card so far if there are other
 
01:46:17.090 --> 01:46:17.100 align:start position:0%
people planning to speak please fill the
 
01:46:20.330 --> 01:46:20.340 align:start position:0%
cars get them turned in and this is Kate
 
01:46:23.570 --> 01:46:23.580 align:start position:0%
Littman representing representing
 
01:46:26.030 --> 01:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
Senator Carson who is the Prime sponsor
 
01:46:30.950 --> 01:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:30.960 --> 01:46:32.149 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:46:32.149 --> 01:46:32.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:46:34.010 --> 01:46:34.020 align:start position:0%
uh good morning my name is Kate Lipman
 
01:46:35.810 --> 01:46:35.820 align:start position:0%
I'm the Senate majority policy director
 
01:46:38.510 --> 01:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
I am here to introduce Senate Bill 46 on
 
01:46:40.189 --> 01:46:40.199 align:start position:0%
behalf of Senator Carson
 
01:46:42.410 --> 01:46:42.420 align:start position:0%
improved technology enables employees to
 
01:46:44.689 --> 01:46:44.699 align:start position:0%
be paid more consistently and securely a
 
01:46:46.430 --> 01:46:46.440 align:start position:0%
wage payment law modernization is needed
 
01:46:47.930 --> 01:46:47.940 align:start position:0%
to permit employers to pay wages
 
01:46:50.330 --> 01:46:50.340 align:start position:0%
electronically it can be impossible for
 
01:46:52.070 --> 01:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
employers to comply with wage payment
 
01:46:54.709 --> 01:46:54.719 align:start position:0%
laws if they must offer paper checks
 
01:46:56.750 --> 01:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
too often employees who receive paper
 
01:46:58.850 --> 01:46:58.860 align:start position:0%
checks can't get paid on payday if
 
01:47:00.350 --> 01:47:00.360 align:start position:0%
there's a snowstorm or other issues
 
01:47:02.330 --> 01:47:02.340 align:start position:0%
preventing travel to the workplace of
 
01:47:02.340 --> 01:47:03.350 align:start position:0%
preventing travel to the workplace of
banks

01:47:03.350 --> 01:47:03.360 align:start position:0%
banks
 
01:47:05.330 --> 01:47:05.340 align:start position:0%
offering electronic wage payments such
 
01:47:07.070 --> 01:47:07.080 align:start position:0%
as choice of direct deposit or debit
 
01:47:09.530 --> 01:47:09.540 align:start position:0%
card will would eliminate this concern
 
01:47:12.109 --> 01:47:12.119 align:start position:0%
Most states are already doing this as 93
 
01:47:14.209 --> 01:47:14.219 align:start position:0%
of American workers are paid via direct
 
01:47:16.729 --> 01:47:16.739 align:start position:0%
deposit in the 31 states that allow
 
01:47:18.290 --> 01:47:18.300 align:start position:0%
direct deposit there have been no
 
01:47:21.109 --> 01:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
complaints debit cards offer far better
 
01:47:22.609 --> 01:47:22.619 align:start position:0%
consumer protections and convenience
 
01:47:25.010 --> 01:47:25.020 align:start position:0%
than checks employees are able to choose
 
01:47:27.410 --> 01:47:27.420 align:start position:0%
between direct deposit or debit cards at
 
01:47:29.570 --> 01:47:29.580 align:start position:0%
any time and those who do prefer a paper
 
01:47:31.609 --> 01:47:31.619 align:start position:0%
check would still have that option
 
01:47:33.350 --> 01:47:33.360 align:start position:0%
in the event that an employee is unable
 
01:47:34.970 --> 01:47:34.980 align:start position:0%
to access their wages from a debit card
 
01:47:36.770 --> 01:47:36.780 align:start position:0%
the employer would provide a replacement
 
01:47:39.229 --> 01:47:39.239 align:start position:0%
card check direct deposit or cash and
 
01:47:40.910 --> 01:47:40.920 align:start position:0%
would still remain liable for failing to
 
01:47:42.470 --> 01:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
pay wages on time
 
01:47:44.030 --> 01:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to speak
 
01:47:45.649 --> 01:47:45.659 align:start position:0%
today I'll defer any questions to those
 
01:47:47.330 --> 01:47:47.340 align:start position:0%
behind me if there are any who wish to
 
01:47:48.530 --> 01:47:48.540 align:start position:0%
speak on the bill and if there aren't
 
01:47:50.270 --> 01:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
any I'm happy to pass along any
 
01:47:52.010 --> 01:47:52.020 align:start position:0%
questions to Senator Carson and get that
 
01:47:54.709 --> 01:47:54.719 align:start position:0%
back to you all right thank you very
 
01:47:56.810 --> 01:47:56.820 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony can we get a
 
01:47:58.729 --> 01:47:58.739 align:start position:0%
copy of do you do you have a written
 
01:48:00.950 --> 01:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
copy that you can turn in
 
01:48:02.450 --> 01:48:02.460 align:start position:0%
or email
 
01:48:05.330 --> 01:48:05.340 align:start position:0%
uh afterward if you don't it has my
 
01:48:06.770 --> 01:48:06.780 align:start position:0%
notes on is that okay
 
01:48:10.010 --> 01:48:10.020 align:start position:0%
that's fine you're fine with that thank
 
01:48:10.020 --> 01:48:11.950 align:start position:0%
that's fine you're fine with that thank
you

01:48:11.950 --> 01:48:11.960 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:48:15.109 --> 01:48:15.119 align:start position:0%
the other uh just before you step away
 
01:48:17.330 --> 01:48:17.340 align:start position:0%
and I'll ask the question although you
 
01:48:19.129 --> 01:48:19.139 align:start position:0%
don't have to answer it I'll I'll leave
 
01:48:21.229 --> 01:48:21.239 align:start position:0%
it out there um for other people
 
01:48:26.090 --> 01:48:26.100 align:start position:0%
testifying you mentioned that 31 States
 
01:48:28.729 --> 01:48:28.739 align:start position:0%
have a requirement for direct deposit
 
01:48:31.669 --> 01:48:31.679 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering if that number is
 
01:48:35.930 --> 01:48:35.940 align:start position:0%
different for those that require
 
01:48:39.109 --> 01:48:39.119 align:start position:0%
um employees except a payroll card or a
 
01:48:42.410 --> 01:48:42.420 align:start position:0%
debit card if direct deposit is not
 
01:48:42.420 --> 01:48:44.750 align:start position:0%
debit card if direct deposit is not
available

01:48:44.750 --> 01:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:46.189 --> 01:48:46.199 align:start position:0%
I can certainly find that out from you
 
01:48:47.570 --> 01:48:47.580 align:start position:0%
from Senator Carson let you know all
 
01:48:49.790 --> 01:48:49.800 align:start position:0%
right thank you thank you very much any
 
01:48:51.709 --> 01:48:51.719 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
01:49:00.410 --> 01:49:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:04.070 --> 01:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
next up I have Pete eisberg
 
01:49:06.830 --> 01:49:06.840 align:start position:0%
representing ADP
 
01:49:16.090 --> 01:49:16.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:18.530 --> 01:49:18.540 align:start position:0%
and I think your micro there how's that
 
01:49:20.689 --> 01:49:20.699 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you Mr chairman and
 
01:49:22.070 --> 01:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
committee members we appreciate the
 
01:49:24.290 --> 01:49:24.300 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak on behalf of Senate
 
01:49:27.109 --> 01:49:27.119 align:start position:0%
Bill 46 this bill would permit employers
 
01:49:29.510 --> 01:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
to offer electronic pay to employees it
 
01:49:31.550 --> 01:49:31.560 align:start position:0%
would just remove the requirement that
 
01:49:33.770 --> 01:49:33.780 align:start position:0%
employers also offer a paper paycheck
 
01:49:35.209 --> 01:49:35.219 align:start position:0%
option to employees
 
01:49:38.450 --> 01:49:38.460 align:start position:0%
that's that what has been adopted in I
 
01:49:40.010 --> 01:49:40.020 align:start position:0%
think now 32 states that permit
 
01:49:41.870 --> 01:49:41.880 align:start position:0%
employers to just offer either direct
 
01:49:44.870 --> 01:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
deposit or payroll cards 93 of workers
 
01:49:46.490 --> 01:49:46.500 align:start position:0%
today already get paid through direct
 
01:49:46.500 --> 01:49:47.810 align:start position:0%
today already get paid through direct
deposit

01:49:47.810 --> 01:49:47.820 align:start position:0%
deposit
 
01:49:49.310 --> 01:49:49.320 align:start position:0%
so it's a relatively small percentage
 
01:49:50.450 --> 01:49:50.460 align:start position:0%
that are still relying on paper
 
01:49:53.090 --> 01:49:53.100 align:start position:0%
paychecks but paper checks are really
 
01:49:55.250 --> 01:49:55.260 align:start position:0%
not a very good option it's it's
 
01:49:57.410 --> 01:49:57.420 align:start position:0%
um the difficulty we we really came to
 
01:50:00.109 --> 01:50:00.119 align:start position:0%
light with cogid when businesses were
 
01:50:01.490 --> 01:50:01.500 align:start position:0%
shut down there was nobody to accept
 
01:50:03.830 --> 01:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
paper paychecks when we wanted to
 
01:50:05.030 --> 01:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
deliver them we couldn't get there in
 
01:50:06.410 --> 01:50:06.420 align:start position:0%
the first place because travel was shut
 
01:50:09.169 --> 01:50:09.179 align:start position:0%
down but it's really very normal it's
 
01:50:10.850 --> 01:50:10.860 align:start position:0%
you know every year we have snow storms
 
01:50:10.860 --> 01:50:12.410 align:start position:0%
you know every year we have snow storms
or

01:50:12.410 --> 01:50:12.420 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:50:14.030 --> 01:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
um some other reason that you just can't
 
01:50:16.729 --> 01:50:16.739 align:start position:0%
get paychecks to the workplace or God
 
01:50:18.169 --> 01:50:18.179 align:start position:0%
forbid somebody is sick they can't get
 
01:50:20.030 --> 01:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
to work to pick up a check or they're
 
01:50:22.070 --> 01:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
traveling or on vacation if they're not
 
01:50:24.470 --> 01:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
there to get up take up the physical
 
01:50:27.770 --> 01:50:27.780 align:start position:0%
paper paycheck they don't get paid
 
01:50:30.410 --> 01:50:30.420 align:start position:0%
and that happens routinely and it really
 
01:50:32.209 --> 01:50:32.219 align:start position:0%
shouldn't it shouldn't we've become used
 
01:50:35.390 --> 01:50:35.400 align:start position:0%
to it but it shouldn't be normal and
 
01:50:37.370 --> 01:50:37.380 align:start position:0%
acceptable for employers not to pay
 
01:50:39.470 --> 01:50:39.480 align:start position:0%
employees if there's inconvenient in any
 
01:50:41.930 --> 01:50:41.940 align:start position:0%
way so this bill would resolve that
 
01:50:43.729 --> 01:50:43.739 align:start position:0%
electronic pay resolves that concern
 
01:50:43.739 --> 01:50:45.709 align:start position:0%
electronic pay resolves that concern
altogether

01:50:45.709 --> 01:50:45.719 align:start position:0%
altogether
 
01:50:47.209 --> 01:50:47.219 align:start position:0%
um you know as mentioned it's much
 
01:50:49.149 --> 01:50:49.159 align:start position:0%
better for employees there was a federal
 
01:50:51.470 --> 01:50:51.480 align:start position:0%
regulations uh Consumer Financial
 
01:50:54.290 --> 01:50:54.300 align:start position:0%
Protection board in 2019 issued
 
01:50:56.689 --> 01:50:56.699 align:start position:0%
regulations on prepaid cards that added
 
01:50:58.570 --> 01:50:58.580 align:start position:0%
lots and lots of good consumer
 
01:51:01.550 --> 01:51:01.560 align:start position:0%
protections the um the fraud protections
 
01:51:03.890 --> 01:51:03.900 align:start position:0%
protections against fraud unauthorized
 
01:51:06.709 --> 01:51:06.719 align:start position:0%
use as a dispute resolution associated
 
01:51:07.970 --> 01:51:07.980 align:start position:0%
with these cards they can't be
 
01:51:10.790 --> 01:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
overdrafted there's no NSF fees possible
 
01:51:13.970 --> 01:51:13.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:13.980 --> 01:51:14.570 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:51:14.570 --> 01:51:14.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:16.250 --> 01:51:16.260 align:start position:0%
and current law already requires that
 
01:51:17.810 --> 01:51:17.820 align:start position:0%
employers provide a free way for
 
01:51:19.669 --> 01:51:19.679 align:start position:0%
employees to you know if they want cash
 
01:51:22.910 --> 01:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
to take these cards to a nearby uh look
 
01:51:25.550 --> 01:51:25.560 align:start position:0%
you know bank or other facility and
 
01:51:27.950 --> 01:51:27.960 align:start position:0%
exchange you know get the full value on
 
01:51:30.290 --> 01:51:30.300 align:start position:0%
the card for cash if they want to so
 
01:51:31.850 --> 01:51:31.860 align:start position:0%
that's possible and it's easy to do that
 
01:51:33.470 --> 01:51:33.480 align:start position:0%
you can go to literally any of the large
 
01:51:38.030 --> 01:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
retailers Costco or Kroger or Walmart
 
01:51:40.189 --> 01:51:40.199 align:start position:0%
any of the large retailers will do that
 
01:51:41.350 --> 01:51:41.360 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:51:43.790 --> 01:51:43.800 align:start position:0%
it also includes you know free savings
 
01:51:45.229 --> 01:51:45.239 align:start position:0%
features so you you know if you're an
 
01:51:46.129 --> 01:51:46.139 align:start position:0%
employee you have one of these cards
 
01:51:47.390 --> 01:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
it's easy for you to say well I'm just
 
01:51:49.189 --> 01:51:49.199 align:start position:0%
going to set up a free sidebar account
 
01:51:50.689 --> 01:51:50.699 align:start position:0%
for vacation savings for Christmas
 
01:51:52.729 --> 01:51:52.739 align:start position:0%
savings for my you can give a card to
 
01:51:53.810 --> 01:51:53.820 align:start position:0%
your daughter who's in college and
 
01:51:55.550 --> 01:51:55.560 align:start position:0%
that's her spending account so a lot of
 
01:51:57.590 --> 01:51:57.600 align:start position:0%
good things there
 
01:51:59.209 --> 01:51:59.219 align:start position:0%
um and really it's the way that
 
01:52:00.890 --> 01:52:00.900 align:start position:0%
everybody's getting paid nowadays it's
 
01:52:01.729 --> 01:52:01.739 align:start position:0%
um you know if you're getting a
 
01:52:03.229 --> 01:52:03.239 align:start position:0%
government payment any government
 
01:52:06.890 --> 01:52:06.900 align:start position:0%
benefit is electronic Social Security
 
01:52:08.590 --> 01:52:08.600 align:start position:0%
um disability unemployment insurance
 
01:52:10.970 --> 01:52:10.980 align:start position:0%
nutrition assistance all that is
 
01:52:10.980 --> 01:52:12.830 align:start position:0%
nutrition assistance all that is
electronic

01:52:12.830 --> 01:52:12.840 align:start position:0%
electronic
 
01:52:14.330 --> 01:52:14.340 align:start position:0%
um all government employees are
 
01:52:16.189 --> 01:52:16.199 align:start position:0%
typically paid electronically and it's
 
01:52:17.570 --> 01:52:17.580 align:start position:0%
really only the private sector workers
 
01:52:19.370 --> 01:52:19.380 align:start position:0%
that are still um you know kind of stuck
 
01:52:20.629 --> 01:52:20.639 align:start position:0%
with a requirement to offer
 
01:52:23.270 --> 01:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
pay-per-paychecks for those who who want
 
01:52:25.189 --> 01:52:25.199 align:start position:0%
it but you know I think it should be up
 
01:52:26.629 --> 01:52:26.639 align:start position:0%
to the employer like if it's important
 
01:52:28.310 --> 01:52:28.320 align:start position:0%
to employees and they really like their
 
01:52:30.109 --> 01:52:30.119 align:start position:0%
paper paychecks employers are certainly
 
01:52:32.149 --> 01:52:32.159 align:start position:0%
free to continue doing that we just
 
01:52:33.290 --> 01:52:33.300 align:start position:0%
don't think it's necessary to have a
 
01:52:34.910 --> 01:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
state law requirement that employers
 
01:52:36.649 --> 01:52:36.659 align:start position:0%
offer paper paychecks and we'd resolve a
 
01:52:39.649 --> 01:52:39.659 align:start position:0%
lot of problems and anyway so I'll stop
 
01:52:41.030 --> 01:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
there I'm glad to answer your questions
 
01:52:43.490 --> 01:52:43.500 align:start position:0%
I appreciate the opportunity thank you
 
01:52:45.709 --> 01:52:45.719 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony I do have a
 
01:52:48.050 --> 01:52:48.060 align:start position:0%
question most in your testimony you
 
01:52:50.510 --> 01:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
emphasize the advantages for the
 
01:52:50.520 --> 01:52:52.010 align:start position:0%
emphasize the advantages for the
employee

01:52:52.010 --> 01:52:52.020 align:start position:0%
employee
 
01:52:53.810 --> 01:52:53.820 align:start position:0%
as you said though
 
01:52:56.810 --> 01:52:56.820 align:start position:0%
the employee can request the paper check
 
01:53:00.370 --> 01:53:00.380 align:start position:0%
or not so I would think
 
01:53:03.470 --> 01:53:03.480 align:start position:0%
what are the advantages from the terms
 
01:53:06.950 --> 01:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
of the employer as in state law that is
 
01:53:09.729 --> 01:53:09.739 align:start position:0%
where the Restriction currently
 
01:53:12.649 --> 01:53:12.659 align:start position:0%
resides right for the employer's
 
01:53:14.450 --> 01:53:14.460 align:start position:0%
perspective it would be a lot easier
 
01:53:16.790 --> 01:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
simpler less expensive because they
 
01:53:19.129 --> 01:53:19.139 align:start position:0%
don't have to if they don't want to they
 
01:53:20.450 --> 01:53:20.460 align:start position:0%
can just offer electronic and they don't
 
01:53:22.790 --> 01:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
have to have the whole system set up to
 
01:53:25.370 --> 01:53:25.380 align:start position:0%
keep track of receive and distribute
 
01:53:27.290 --> 01:53:27.300 align:start position:0%
paper paychecks every pay period it's a
 
01:53:30.590 --> 01:53:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:33.109 --> 01:53:33.119 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions and
 
01:53:35.149 --> 01:53:35.159 align:start position:0%
representative of the line
 
01:53:41.510 --> 01:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:43.669 --> 01:53:43.679 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Granger
 
01:53:45.169 --> 01:53:45.179 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:53:47.209 --> 01:53:47.219 align:start position:0%
um will this uh would this bill hasten
 
01:53:48.649 --> 01:53:48.659 align:start position:0%
the adoption of Central Bank digital
 
01:53:48.659 --> 01:53:50.390 align:start position:0%
the adoption of Central Bank digital
currencies

01:53:50.390 --> 01:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
currencies
 
01:53:51.890 --> 01:53:51.900 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I didn't quite get that would
 
01:53:53.930 --> 01:53:53.940 align:start position:0%
it Hasting the adoption of uh Central
 
01:53:56.030 --> 01:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
Bank digital currencies
 
01:53:58.550 --> 01:53:58.560 align:start position:0%
uh no it has no impact or no effect on
 
01:54:01.310 --> 01:54:01.320 align:start position:0%
digital currencies this is um
 
01:54:02.570 --> 01:54:02.580 align:start position:0%
you know it's just it's like direct
 
01:54:04.550 --> 01:54:04.560 align:start position:0%
deposit but it's to a you know a debit
 
01:54:06.229 --> 01:54:06.239 align:start position:0%
card like any other debit card there's
 
01:54:08.390 --> 01:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
mine it's a VISA branded or a MasterCard
 
01:54:10.490 --> 01:54:10.500 align:start position:0%
branded debit card
 
01:54:15.830 --> 01:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
but in terms of like crypto
 
01:54:15.840 --> 01:54:17.510 align:start position:0%
but in terms of like crypto
follow-up

01:54:17.510 --> 01:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:54:20.629 --> 01:54:20.639 align:start position:0%
uh so when when so does the company
 
01:54:22.729 --> 01:54:22.739 align:start position:0%
issue these debit cards
 
01:54:25.010 --> 01:54:25.020 align:start position:0%
and are there or are they are the debit
 
01:54:26.750 --> 01:54:26.760 align:start position:0%
cards for a specific bank that they're
 
01:54:29.209 --> 01:54:29.219 align:start position:0%
paying through
 
01:54:31.370 --> 01:54:31.380 align:start position:0%
um the company typically hires a payroll
 
01:54:32.810 --> 01:54:32.820 align:start position:0%
firm the payroll firm would offer um
 
01:54:35.030 --> 01:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
either direct deposit or debit cards and
 
01:54:36.590 --> 01:54:36.600 align:start position:0%
of course payroll checks
 
01:54:38.390 --> 01:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
um but the payroll company would arrange
 
01:54:40.790 --> 01:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
with a bank to issue these cards and the
 
01:54:41.990 --> 01:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
bank would be the issuer and
 
01:54:44.270 --> 01:54:44.280 align:start position:0%
administrator of the the card accounts
 
01:54:48.830 --> 01:54:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:50.390 --> 01:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
but if there's any problem the employee
 
01:54:52.129 --> 01:54:52.139 align:start position:0%
always goes back to the employer and the
 
01:54:54.050 --> 01:54:54.060 align:start position:0%
employer's responsible they have to make
 
01:54:55.970 --> 01:54:55.980 align:start position:0%
sure that the employee is paid and that
 
01:54:57.470 --> 01:54:57.480 align:start position:0%
things are working and they get their
 
01:55:01.129 --> 01:55:01.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:03.530 --> 01:55:03.540 align:start position:0%
one more follow-up
 
01:55:07.490 --> 01:55:07.500 align:start position:0%
uh thank you so assuming an employee
 
01:55:09.890 --> 01:55:09.900 align:start position:0%
does want to paper check or a cash
 
01:55:12.410 --> 01:55:12.420 align:start position:0%
payment maybe they're concerned about
 
01:55:14.629 --> 01:55:14.639 align:start position:0%
the privacy of having all their records
 
01:55:17.750 --> 01:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
in an electronic form uh for whatever
 
01:55:17.760 --> 01:55:19.430 align:start position:0%
in an electronic form uh for whatever
reason

01:55:19.430 --> 01:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
reason
 
01:55:22.850 --> 01:55:22.860 align:start position:0%
um this bill would basically make it so
 
01:55:25.129 --> 01:55:25.139 align:start position:0%
that if a large company
 
01:55:28.070 --> 01:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
for instance a Fortune 500 company
 
01:55:30.229 --> 01:55:30.239 align:start position:0%
if they don't want to provide a paper
 
01:55:33.050 --> 01:55:33.060 align:start position:0%
check then they wouldn't have to is that
 
01:55:34.790 --> 01:55:34.800 align:start position:0%
correct yes okay
 
01:55:36.410 --> 01:55:36.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:55:38.870 --> 01:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
representative colcum
 
01:55:40.609 --> 01:55:40.619 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:55:42.530 --> 01:55:42.540 align:start position:0%
um so with the debit card there is a
 
01:55:44.450 --> 01:55:44.460 align:start position:0%
bank behind that that's managing the
 
01:55:45.649 --> 01:55:45.659 align:start position:0%
funds that are coming in from the
 
01:55:47.689 --> 01:55:47.699 align:start position:0%
employer yes there are FDIC insured
 
01:55:50.390 --> 01:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
Banks um like yeah
 
01:55:50.400 --> 01:55:53.270 align:start position:0%
Banks um like yeah
exactly

01:55:53.270 --> 01:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:55.189 --> 01:55:55.199 align:start position:0%
well card is misplaced
 
01:55:58.189 --> 01:55:58.199 align:start position:0%
uh then those funds are still available
 
01:56:00.290 --> 01:56:00.300 align:start position:0%
yes it's very easy very fast you can
 
01:56:02.149 --> 01:56:02.159 align:start position:0%
actually instant issue a card from the
 
01:56:04.070 --> 01:56:04.080 align:start position:0%
employer's office to to anybody who
 
01:56:06.590 --> 01:56:06.600 align:start position:0%
loses their card and print a new one in
 
01:56:08.510 --> 01:56:08.520 align:start position:0%
the next few days kind of thing so it's
 
01:56:10.010 --> 01:56:10.020 align:start position:0%
that's something that's very easy to
 
01:56:11.930 --> 01:56:11.940 align:start position:0%
resolve and the funds of course are
 
01:56:11.940 --> 01:56:14.689 align:start position:0%
resolve and the funds of course are
protected

01:56:14.689 --> 01:56:14.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:14.699 --> 01:56:21.109 align:start position:0%
 
well

01:56:21.109 --> 01:56:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:22.850 --> 01:56:22.860 align:start position:0%
um the funds are you know the card is
 
01:56:24.470 --> 01:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
theirs the account is theirs they can
 
01:56:25.910 --> 01:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
continue they can take that card
 
01:56:27.830 --> 01:56:27.840 align:start position:0%
actually to another employer and ask the
 
01:56:29.570 --> 01:56:29.580 align:start position:0%
employer to just continue depositing
 
01:56:31.070 --> 01:56:31.080 align:start position:0%
directly to that cart so it's a
 
01:56:32.930 --> 01:56:32.940 align:start position:0%
functional equivalent of a bank account
 
01:56:32.940 --> 01:56:36.770 align:start position:0%
functional equivalent of a bank account
really

01:56:36.770 --> 01:56:36.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:39.830 --> 01:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry will fees then be imposed when
 
01:56:41.810 --> 01:56:41.820 align:start position:0%
he leaves that employer for maintaining
 
01:56:44.629 --> 01:56:44.639 align:start position:0%
that account or will they continue to be
 
01:56:46.850 --> 01:56:46.860 align:start position:0%
not imposed because it was a paycheck
 
01:56:49.430 --> 01:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
debit card system
 
01:56:52.129 --> 01:56:52.139 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if there's a law against
 
01:56:53.810 --> 01:56:53.820 align:start position:0%
that or if that's in the regulation e
 
01:56:57.229 --> 01:56:57.239 align:start position:0%
the the prepaid card but I my impression
 
01:56:59.450 --> 01:56:59.460 align:start position:0%
is that there are no fees um if somebody
 
01:57:01.729 --> 01:57:01.739 align:start position:0%
leaves an employer and continues to use
 
01:57:03.050 --> 01:57:03.060 align:start position:0%
the account elsewhere
 
01:57:05.030 --> 01:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
there's there's very few fees that
 
01:57:06.470 --> 01:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
actually apply the only way that you get
 
01:57:08.149 --> 01:57:08.159 align:start position:0%
charged fees with these cards nowadays
 
01:57:10.250 --> 01:57:10.260 align:start position:0%
is if you just for convenience if you
 
01:57:12.169 --> 01:57:12.179 align:start position:0%
have we want to use an ATM that's nearby
 
01:57:14.510 --> 01:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
as opposed to you know finding one that
 
01:57:16.070 --> 01:57:16.080 align:start position:0%
is free that is one of the surcharge
 
01:57:18.169 --> 01:57:18.179 align:start position:0%
free ones or again going to a major
 
01:57:20.870 --> 01:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
retailer all those are free but part of
 
01:57:20.880 --> 01:57:21.530 align:start position:0%
retailer all those are free but part of
the

01:57:21.530 --> 01:57:21.540 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:57:23.810 --> 01:57:23.820 align:start position:0%
system is you know you actually have a
 
01:57:26.209 --> 01:57:26.219 align:start position:0%
phone app on your smartphone and you can
 
01:57:27.350 --> 01:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
just bring it up and say where's the
 
01:57:28.970 --> 01:57:28.980 align:start position:0%
nearest free ATM it's very quick and
 
01:57:30.890 --> 01:57:30.900 align:start position:0%
it'll tell you exactly where to go to to
 
01:57:36.050 --> 01:57:36.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:36.060 --> 01:57:38.149 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:57:38.149 --> 01:57:38.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:57:40.570 --> 01:57:40.580 align:start position:0%
thank you just to follow up on
 
01:57:43.790 --> 01:57:43.800 align:start position:0%
representative's question fees do you
 
01:57:45.350 --> 01:57:45.360 align:start position:0%
get charge of fee every time you use the
 
01:57:47.390 --> 01:57:47.400 align:start position:0%
card no matter what you're doing or is
 
01:57:48.890 --> 01:57:48.900 align:start position:0%
this something that
 
01:57:51.950 --> 01:57:51.960 align:start position:0%
you know just like a typical credit card
 
01:57:54.410 --> 01:57:54.420 align:start position:0%
no I mean any fees are disclosed again
 
01:57:56.810 --> 01:57:56.820 align:start position:0%
again under the federal law regulation
 
01:57:59.030 --> 01:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
requires all fees to be disclosed in
 
01:58:01.550 --> 01:58:01.560 align:start position:0%
advance to card holders and and
 
01:58:04.070 --> 01:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
basically the only fee you know you it
 
01:58:06.290 --> 01:58:06.300 align:start position:0%
prohibits most fees like the the swipe
 
01:58:07.850 --> 01:58:07.860 align:start position:0%
if you're actually using it as a debit
 
01:58:09.410 --> 01:58:09.420 align:start position:0%
card to pay for your groceries or pay
 
01:58:11.330 --> 01:58:11.340 align:start position:0%
for anything or online making a purchase
 
01:58:13.430 --> 01:58:13.440 align:start position:0%
there are no fees for that uh really the
 
01:58:16.669 --> 01:58:16.679 align:start position:0%
only fee is if um you go to an out of
 
01:58:18.410 --> 01:58:18.420 align:start position:0%
network ATM because it's convenient it's
 
01:58:19.609 --> 01:58:19.619 align:start position:0%
the one that's right next to you as
 
01:58:21.649 --> 01:58:21.659 align:start position:0%
opposed to wherever it is
 
01:58:24.530 --> 01:58:24.540 align:start position:0%
right yeah I understand that can can I
 
01:58:26.810 --> 01:58:26.820 align:start position:0%
follow up please oh I just heard you
 
01:58:28.550 --> 01:58:28.560 align:start position:0%
know in the past that these this system
 
01:58:31.669 --> 01:58:31.679 align:start position:0%
has really been detrimental to employees
 
01:58:35.930 --> 01:58:35.940 align:start position:0%
over the years that somehow they get
 
01:58:38.450 --> 01:58:38.460 align:start position:0%
to use a term user or earlier screwed
 
01:58:41.030 --> 01:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
when they use this stuff then I and you
 
01:58:43.070 --> 01:58:43.080 align:start position:0%
know obviously a lot of people live
 
01:58:44.570 --> 01:58:44.580 align:start position:0%
paycheck to paycheck we don't want to
 
01:58:46.790 --> 01:58:46.800 align:start position:0%
see anybody getting unnecessary fees or
 
01:58:48.770 --> 01:58:48.780 align:start position:0%
even losing that balance
 
01:58:50.629 --> 01:58:50.639 align:start position:0%
over if a certain amount of time has
 
01:58:50.639 --> 01:58:51.709 align:start position:0%
over if a certain amount of time has
passed

01:58:51.709 --> 01:58:51.719 align:start position:0%
passed
 
01:58:53.330 --> 01:58:53.340 align:start position:0%
you know maybe they didn't need the
 
01:58:54.770 --> 01:58:54.780 align:start position:0%
money for a few weeks so they didn't use
 
01:58:55.729 --> 01:58:55.739 align:start position:0%
the card
 
01:58:57.410 --> 01:58:57.420 align:start position:0%
is that money still there and it just
 
01:58:59.149 --> 01:58:59.159 align:start position:0%
keeps getting topped off every week is
 
01:59:00.950 --> 01:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
is that how it works yes exactly the
 
01:59:02.330 --> 01:59:02.340 align:start position:0%
employer just adds to it every pay
 
01:59:04.310 --> 01:59:04.320 align:start position:0%
period and those monies don't go away
 
01:59:06.709 --> 01:59:06.719 align:start position:0%
there's no fees that take funds out of
 
01:59:09.290 --> 01:59:09.300 align:start position:0%
the account uh uh there's no maintenance
 
01:59:11.510 --> 01:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
fees or anything like that um uh from
 
01:59:12.530 --> 01:59:12.540 align:start position:0%
when you mentioned and I think you're
 
01:59:13.970 --> 01:59:13.980 align:start position:0%
referring to there was a pretty negative
 
01:59:15.589 --> 01:59:15.599 align:start position:0%
article in New York Times in like 2014
 
01:59:18.109 --> 01:59:18.119 align:start position:0%
called pinch by plastic which really
 
01:59:19.129 --> 01:59:19.139 align:start position:0%
brought a lot of attention to this and
 
01:59:21.649 --> 01:59:21.659 align:start position:0%
resulted in the Federal Regulation that
 
01:59:23.629 --> 01:59:23.639 align:start position:0%
eliminated all of those fees and and
 
01:59:25.669 --> 01:59:25.679 align:start position:0%
really resolve the issue again that was
 
01:59:27.709 --> 01:59:27.719 align:start position:0%
2019 we really have not heard complaints
 
01:59:29.390 --> 01:59:29.400 align:start position:0%
since then
 
01:59:31.550 --> 01:59:31.560 align:start position:0%
all right thank you thank you
 
01:59:34.129 --> 01:59:34.139 align:start position:0%
representative Drago
 
01:59:35.810 --> 01:59:35.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:59:37.450 --> 01:59:37.460 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:59:40.370 --> 01:59:40.380 align:start position:0%
I own a small business I we don't
 
01:59:42.169 --> 01:59:42.179 align:start position:0%
utilize this
 
01:59:43.490 --> 01:59:43.500 align:start position:0%
um but I'm sure there are other small
 
01:59:45.530 --> 01:59:45.540 align:start position:0%
businesses that do and I happen to be
 
01:59:46.609 --> 01:59:46.619 align:start position:0%
driving this morning with my business
 
01:59:48.830 --> 01:59:48.840 align:start position:0%
partner and I shared with him how you
 
01:59:50.270 --> 01:59:50.280 align:start position:0%
know we replaced the cards and all that
 
01:59:52.669 --> 01:59:52.679 align:start position:0%
his response was we'd be replacing the
 
01:59:54.470 --> 01:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
cards every day
 
01:59:54.480 --> 01:59:55.609 align:start position:0%
cards every day
um

01:59:55.609 --> 01:59:55.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:57.530 --> 01:59:57.540 align:start position:0%
depending on the industry you're in a
 
01:59:59.330 --> 01:59:59.340 align:start position:0%
lot of times you have I guess not so
 
02:00:02.570 --> 02:00:02.580 align:start position:0%
responsible employees uh and we see it
 
02:00:03.830 --> 02:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
with our gas cards all the time they'll
 
02:00:05.209 --> 02:00:05.219 align:start position:0%
get lost we always have to call the bank
 
02:00:06.770 --> 02:00:06.780 align:start position:0%
and get canceled and get new ones
 
02:00:08.810 --> 02:00:08.820 align:start position:0%
replaced there's a line in here that
 
02:00:10.910 --> 02:00:10.920 align:start position:0%
says if an employee debit card is lost
 
02:00:12.770 --> 02:00:12.780 align:start position:0%
stolen or damaged such that the funds
 
02:00:14.149 --> 02:00:14.159 align:start position:0%
are no longer accessible the employee
 
02:00:16.250 --> 02:00:16.260 align:start position:0%
the employer shall provide the employee
 
02:00:19.310 --> 02:00:19.320 align:start position:0%
with their placement within 24 hours
 
02:00:21.649 --> 02:00:21.659 align:start position:0%
if he calls me on a Friday night and we
 
02:00:24.470 --> 02:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
have 14 employees and they they were out
 
02:00:25.689 --> 02:00:25.699 align:start position:0%
for the night they lost it or whatever
 
02:00:28.430 --> 02:00:28.440 align:start position:0%
am I blocking off or any employer there
 
02:00:29.810 --> 02:00:29.820 align:start position:0%
I have to block off their entire weekend
 
02:00:32.930 --> 02:00:32.940 align:start position:0%
now to replace the cards we don't I I'm
 
02:00:34.310 --> 02:00:34.320 align:start position:0%
just curious as to how that works
 
02:00:36.589 --> 02:00:36.599 align:start position:0%
because in my situation I don't have
 
02:00:38.510 --> 02:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
office staff 24 hours a day to do this
 
02:00:41.510 --> 02:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
what do those employers do
 
02:00:43.189 --> 02:00:43.199 align:start position:0%
uh that is a good question I'm not
 
02:00:44.149 --> 02:00:44.159 align:start position:0%
really sure
 
02:00:44.159 --> 02:00:44.930 align:start position:0%
really sure
um

02:00:44.930 --> 02:00:44.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:48.649 --> 02:00:48.659 align:start position:0%
you know I I think any employee can call
 
02:00:50.270 --> 02:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
the card company itself of it you know
 
02:00:51.290 --> 02:00:51.300 align:start position:0%
again if they don't have a card they
 
02:00:52.370 --> 02:00:52.380 align:start position:0%
don't have the phone number necessarily
 
02:00:54.109 --> 02:00:54.119 align:start position:0%
but if they can call the employer and
 
02:00:55.669 --> 02:00:55.679 align:start position:0%
figure out you know who the issuer is
 
02:00:57.589 --> 02:00:57.599 align:start position:0%
they can call and just get a replacement
 
02:00:59.390 --> 02:00:59.400 align:start position:0%
card and then the card company would
 
02:01:02.629 --> 02:01:02.639 align:start position:0%
handle the issuance again typically um
 
02:01:03.589 --> 02:01:03.599 align:start position:0%
if you're working with the payroll
 
02:01:07.010 --> 02:01:07.020 align:start position:0%
company we we provide a a stock of maybe
 
02:01:09.290 --> 02:01:09.300 align:start position:0%
10 cards just for instant issue so that
 
02:01:10.609 --> 02:01:10.619 align:start position:0%
if that doesn't happen you can just turn
 
02:01:13.430 --> 02:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
around open your you know desk door and
 
02:01:16.430 --> 02:01:16.440 align:start position:0%
issue another card instantly but
 
02:01:18.050 --> 02:01:18.060 align:start position:0%
weekends um yeah it's a good question
 
02:01:19.729 --> 02:01:19.739 align:start position:0%
I'm not quite sure how that would work
 
02:01:21.530 --> 02:01:21.540 align:start position:0%
if the employer is not available and the
 
02:01:24.530 --> 02:01:24.540 align:start position:0%
employee's not sure who to call
 
02:01:24.540 --> 02:01:25.850 align:start position:0%
employee's not sure who to call
follow-up

02:01:25.850 --> 02:01:25.860 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:01:29.209 --> 02:01:29.219 align:start position:0%
so that that was that was my main
 
02:01:31.129 --> 02:01:31.139 align:start position:0%
question about that but then I guess
 
02:01:32.750 --> 02:01:32.760 align:start position:0%
they could call the maybe they could
 
02:01:34.010 --> 02:01:34.020 align:start position:0%
text me and I could just give them the
 
02:01:35.450 --> 02:01:35.460 align:start position:0%
I'm sure all the card numbers are the
 
02:01:37.070 --> 02:01:37.080 align:start position:0%
same on the back to call losses stolen
 
02:01:38.209 --> 02:01:38.219 align:start position:0%
whatever yeah
 
02:01:40.910 --> 02:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
if they call and for whatever reason
 
02:01:42.649 --> 02:01:42.659 align:start position:0%
wherever you get the card from the bank
 
02:01:45.109 --> 02:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
or whatever they're not open who's
 
02:01:46.850 --> 02:01:46.860 align:start position:0%
responsible that situation is it me
 
02:01:49.070 --> 02:01:49.080 align:start position:0%
having to come back to pay them cash or
 
02:01:51.770 --> 02:01:51.780 align:start position:0%
do we just say yeah you're gone for the
 
02:01:53.629 --> 02:01:53.639 align:start position:0%
weekend and the bank's not open I have
 
02:01:55.250 --> 02:01:55.260 align:start position:0%
to wait till Monday who's responsible in
 
02:01:57.229 --> 02:01:57.239 align:start position:0%
that situation that could be difficult
 
02:01:59.450 --> 02:01:59.460 align:start position:0%
there is a line in the bill that says
 
02:02:00.410 --> 02:02:00.420 align:start position:0%
that you know if employees have
 
02:02:00.420 --> 02:02:01.430 align:start position:0%
that you know if employees have
difficulties

02:02:01.430 --> 02:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
difficulties
 
02:02:03.050 --> 02:02:03.060 align:start position:0%
um you know getting access to their
 
02:02:05.390 --> 02:02:05.400 align:start position:0%
funds that the employer has to issue as
 
02:02:07.070 --> 02:02:07.080 align:start position:0%
you mentioned uh you know some sort of
 
02:02:10.010 --> 02:02:10.020 align:start position:0%
replacement cash card or check within 24
 
02:02:13.490 --> 02:02:13.500 align:start position:0%
hours so that may be a a concern for
 
02:02:17.050 --> 02:02:17.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:19.310 --> 02:02:19.320 align:start position:0%
representative Susie thank you Mr
 
02:02:20.270 --> 02:02:20.280 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking the
 
02:02:22.669 --> 02:02:22.679 align:start position:0%
question just real quick somebody that
 
02:02:24.649 --> 02:02:24.659 align:start position:0%
doesn't do banking at all for whatever
 
02:02:27.470 --> 02:02:27.480 align:start position:0%
purposes gets this debit card is it they
 
02:02:29.330 --> 02:02:29.340 align:start position:0%
go to the ATM is there a limit on the
 
02:02:29.340 --> 02:02:30.530 align:start position:0%
go to the ATM is there a limit on the
ATM

02:02:30.530 --> 02:02:30.540 align:start position:0%
ATM
 
02:02:32.629 --> 02:02:32.639 align:start position:0%
that they'll be able to withdraw so
 
02:02:33.770 --> 02:02:33.780 align:start position:0%
let's say somebody's got a thousand
 
02:02:35.209 --> 02:02:35.219 align:start position:0%
dollars they want to take out can they
 
02:02:36.709 --> 02:02:36.719 align:start position:0%
go to the ATM take a thousand dollars
 
02:02:38.689 --> 02:02:38.699 align:start position:0%
outward do you know of any ATMs that
 
02:02:41.209 --> 02:02:41.219 align:start position:0%
have mac uh maximums that they allow
 
02:02:43.310 --> 02:02:43.320 align:start position:0%
people to take out at one time yes it's
 
02:02:44.990 --> 02:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
actually a good question and there's a
 
02:02:46.430 --> 02:02:46.440 align:start position:0%
related issue which is what if I have
 
02:02:48.649 --> 02:02:48.659 align:start position:0%
321 dollars and 18 cents and I want all
 
02:02:50.270 --> 02:02:50.280 align:start position:0%
of it you know the ATM is not going to
 
02:02:52.370 --> 02:02:52.380 align:start position:0%
give you that but the answer I think is
 
02:02:54.229 --> 02:02:54.239 align:start position:0%
to you walk into any bank that has a
 
02:02:55.790 --> 02:02:55.800 align:start position:0%
Visa or MasterCard logo on the window
 
02:02:58.010 --> 02:02:58.020 align:start position:0%
which is virtually all of them and go to
 
02:02:59.870 --> 02:02:59.880 align:start position:0%
the teller and say I'd like the full
 
02:03:01.729 --> 02:03:01.739 align:start position:0%
amount on this card and they are
 
02:03:03.709 --> 02:03:03.719 align:start position:0%
obligated they're required to pay the
 
02:03:06.470 --> 02:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
full amount in cash without a fee
 
02:03:08.330 --> 02:03:08.340 align:start position:0%
but it does involve walking into a bank
 
02:03:12.350 --> 02:03:12.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:12.360 --> 02:03:13.250 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:03:13.250 --> 02:03:13.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:14.870 --> 02:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
representative Granger has another
 
02:03:17.209 --> 02:03:17.219 align:start position:0%
question you want me to go first oh uh
 
02:03:19.850 --> 02:03:19.860 align:start position:0%
ah sorry represent Broody thank you Mr
 
02:03:19.860 --> 02:03:21.109 align:start position:0%
ah sorry represent Broody thank you Mr
chairman

02:03:21.109 --> 02:03:21.119 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
02:03:22.850 --> 02:03:22.860 align:start position:0%
um first of all I didn't get your name
 
02:03:25.609 --> 02:03:25.619 align:start position:0%
or who you represent I'm sorry I'm my
 
02:03:26.870 --> 02:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
name is Pete Iceberg I'm vice president
 
02:03:29.629 --> 02:03:29.639 align:start position:0%
of government relations for ADP ADP is
 
02:03:31.070 --> 02:03:31.080 align:start position:0%
the largest payroll company in the
 
02:03:32.990 --> 02:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
nation we we pay one out of every six
 
02:03:35.149 --> 02:03:35.159 align:start position:0%
U.S workers
 
02:03:37.609 --> 02:03:37.619 align:start position:0%
okay thank you now you mentioned
 
02:03:40.550 --> 02:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
something about changing employers
 
02:03:42.530 --> 02:03:42.540 align:start position:0%
you're still going to use that same card
 
02:03:45.169 --> 02:03:45.179 align:start position:0%
or do you get a new card you can use the
 
02:03:47.089 --> 02:03:47.099 align:start position:0%
same card so if you don't have a
 
02:03:49.430 --> 02:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
conventional bank account and you'd like
 
02:03:51.109 --> 02:03:51.119 align:start position:0%
to continue continue getting your
 
02:03:53.270 --> 02:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
paychecks electronically you could just
 
02:03:54.890 --> 02:03:54.900 align:start position:0%
tell the employer your your bank account
 
02:03:56.450 --> 02:03:56.460 align:start position:0%
number associated with the card and that
 
02:03:59.089 --> 02:03:59.099 align:start position:0%
is your they just make deposits into the
 
02:04:02.689 --> 02:04:02.699 align:start position:0%
card as if nothing had changed
 
02:04:05.689 --> 02:04:05.699 align:start position:0%
so you're like follow-up follow-up yeah
 
02:04:07.910 --> 02:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
so you're not like a third party you're
 
02:04:09.589 --> 02:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
like a fourth party you've got the
 
02:04:12.169 --> 02:04:12.179 align:start position:0%
employer the employee some banks
 
02:04:14.030 --> 02:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
involved and then there's you
 
02:04:16.070 --> 02:04:16.080 align:start position:0%
is that what
 
02:04:17.810 --> 02:04:17.820 align:start position:0%
well I mean
 
02:04:20.270 --> 02:04:20.280 align:start position:0%
uh payroll companies are involved in you
 
02:04:21.649 --> 02:04:21.659 align:start position:0%
know calculating the paychecks and
 
02:04:23.270 --> 02:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
issuing the paychecks and the paycheck
 
02:04:25.970 --> 02:04:25.980 align:start position:0%
and check stubs and W-2s and things like
 
02:04:28.910 --> 02:04:28.920 align:start position:0%
that so we offer the the payroll cards
 
02:04:31.430 --> 02:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
and we work with banks to to do it the
 
02:04:32.270 --> 02:04:32.280 align:start position:0%
banks are the actually the
 
02:04:34.310 --> 02:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
administrators but that's not a change
 
02:04:36.050 --> 02:04:36.060 align:start position:0%
from how it works today there's there's
 
02:04:38.330 --> 02:04:38.340 align:start position:0%
always been employers payroll companies
 
02:04:40.990 --> 02:04:41.000 align:start position:0%
Banks and employees
 
02:04:44.270 --> 02:04:44.280 align:start position:0%
but you're using this like as a credit
 
02:04:46.609 --> 02:04:46.619 align:start position:0%
card or debit card it's a debit card
 
02:04:49.729 --> 02:04:49.739 align:start position:0%
yeah but another mancaster service that
 
02:04:53.930 --> 02:04:53.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:56.330 --> 02:04:56.340 align:start position:0%
um this is a yeah the debit card is a is
 
02:04:57.830 --> 02:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
an account Arrangement that they offer
 
02:05:00.649 --> 02:05:00.659 align:start position:0%
again carefully controlled with fees
 
02:05:03.350 --> 02:05:03.360 align:start position:0%
disclosed in advance and so forth
 
02:05:05.870 --> 02:05:05.880 align:start position:0%
so all right thank you
 
02:05:07.790 --> 02:05:07.800 align:start position:0%
representative Cahill
 
02:05:09.970 --> 02:05:09.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Sharon thank you Mr
 
02:05:13.010 --> 02:05:13.020 align:start position:0%
Weisberg Iceberg thank you thank you
 
02:05:15.229 --> 02:05:15.239 align:start position:0%
um so you said that many of the fees are
 
02:05:18.649 --> 02:05:18.659 align:start position:0%
gone after all that bad press uh among
 
02:05:21.169 --> 02:05:21.179 align:start position:0%
them would it be the uh the fee that
 
02:05:24.229 --> 02:05:24.239 align:start position:0%
happens after you after one transaction
 
02:05:26.330 --> 02:05:26.340 align:start position:0%
if you go to the bank and take out half
 
02:05:28.729 --> 02:05:28.739 align:start position:0%
of your paycheck is there still is there
 
02:05:32.990 --> 02:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:35.149 --> 02:05:35.159 align:start position:0%
um that's a good question there can be
 
02:05:36.770 --> 02:05:36.780 align:start position:0%
um I mean the employers are required to
 
02:05:39.290 --> 02:05:39.300 align:start position:0%
and these cards are required to
 
02:05:42.290 --> 02:05:42.300 align:start position:0%
um permit somebody to take uh a
 
02:05:43.609 --> 02:05:43.619 align:start position:0%
transaction for the full amount of the
 
02:05:45.770 --> 02:05:45.780 align:start position:0%
card but if they want to you know spread
 
02:05:47.450 --> 02:05:47.460 align:start position:0%
it out and take multiple transactions
 
02:05:48.830 --> 02:05:48.840 align:start position:0%
and withdraw a certain amount over a
 
02:05:50.209 --> 02:05:50.219 align:start position:0%
number of days there could be
 
02:05:51.950 --> 02:05:51.960 align:start position:0%
transactions on the second third and so
 
02:05:53.270 --> 02:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
forth but
 
02:05:55.490 --> 02:05:55.500 align:start position:0%
um again in any event it's always free
 
02:05:56.990 --> 02:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
if you just walk into a teller and say
 
02:05:59.750 --> 02:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
give me uh X dollars
 
02:06:02.930 --> 02:06:02.940 align:start position:0%
follow up and the most the ATMs that we
 
02:06:05.030 --> 02:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
have out there are in network so they
 
02:06:07.010 --> 02:06:07.020 align:start position:0%
don't charge a fee so even if it's a
 
02:06:08.689 --> 02:06:08.699 align:start position:0%
second or third there's no fee for those
 
02:06:08.699 --> 02:06:10.609 align:start position:0%
second or third there's no fee for those
transactions

02:06:10.609 --> 02:06:10.619 align:start position:0%
transactions
 
02:06:13.430 --> 02:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
um I I believe I recall balance inquiry
 
02:06:15.709 --> 02:06:15.719 align:start position:0%
fees have they been eliminated by
 
02:06:15.719 --> 02:06:17.629 align:start position:0%
fees have they been eliminated by
Congress

02:06:17.629 --> 02:06:17.639 align:start position:0%
Congress
 
02:06:21.410 --> 02:06:21.420 align:start position:0%
um the cfpb rule I believe did eliminate
 
02:06:24.050 --> 02:06:24.060 align:start position:0%
that and it required that these cards
 
02:06:26.750 --> 02:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
offer a free means of multiple free
 
02:06:28.550 --> 02:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
means of checking your account balance
 
02:06:30.770 --> 02:06:30.780 align:start position:0%
it's always a I'm always like I have a
 
02:06:32.149 --> 02:06:32.159 align:start position:0%
Starbucks card and I never know how much
 
02:06:33.970 --> 02:06:33.980 align:start position:0%
is on it so everybody needs to know
 
02:06:37.370 --> 02:06:37.380 align:start position:0%
swiping or phone uh that can call a
 
02:06:39.770 --> 02:06:39.780 align:start position:0%
phone number or you can check your phone
 
02:06:41.810 --> 02:06:41.820 align:start position:0%
app but
 
02:06:45.109 --> 02:06:45.119 align:start position:0%
or use an ATM there can be no fee for
 
02:06:47.750 --> 02:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
checking your balance amount
 
02:06:47.760 --> 02:06:49.089 align:start position:0%
checking your balance amount
follow-up

02:06:49.089 --> 02:06:49.099 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:06:51.890 --> 02:06:51.900 align:start position:0%
and who makes the money when you when
 
02:06:53.629 --> 02:06:53.639 align:start position:0%
all these cards are out there being used
 
02:06:56.209 --> 02:06:56.219 align:start position:0%
you know in restaurants and stores who's
 
02:06:58.669 --> 02:06:58.679 align:start position:0%
who's making the swipe fees is that is
 
02:07:01.310 --> 02:07:01.320 align:start position:0%
does ADP have a piece of that I believe
 
02:07:03.589 --> 02:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
so yes yes so we get a small fraction of
 
02:07:05.990 --> 02:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
the transaction fees the swipe fees as
 
02:07:08.270 --> 02:07:08.280 align:start position:0%
you say it pays for a lot and those
 
02:07:11.209 --> 02:07:11.219 align:start position:0%
those are paid for by retailers and such
 
02:07:13.010 --> 02:07:13.020 align:start position:0%
whoever is receiving the payment right
 
02:07:15.950 --> 02:07:15.960 align:start position:0%
and little things add up yeah so so
 
02:07:17.450 --> 02:07:17.460 align:start position:0%
these little things add up to quite a
 
02:07:20.810 --> 02:07:20.820 align:start position:0%
bit which is why you keep on coming back
 
02:07:23.510 --> 02:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh be careful that your questions are
 
02:07:26.689 --> 02:07:26.699 align:start position:0%
questions and uh right okay so would you
 
02:07:28.910 --> 02:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
believe that that these fees are a
 
02:07:30.890 --> 02:07:30.900 align:start position:0%
strong motivation for this legislation
 
02:07:34.850 --> 02:07:34.860 align:start position:0%
to be coming back to us every two years
 
02:07:34.860 --> 02:07:37.070 align:start position:0%
to be coming back to us every two years
um

02:07:37.070 --> 02:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:38.750 --> 02:07:38.760 align:start position:0%
I was here last year for the first time
 
02:07:41.750 --> 02:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
but um I would say no our primary
 
02:07:43.550 --> 02:07:43.560 align:start position:0%
motivation adp's primary motivation is
 
02:07:45.649 --> 02:07:45.659 align:start position:0%
that we had such a difficult time under
 
02:07:48.290 --> 02:07:48.300 align:start position:0%
covet and delivering paper paychecks to
 
02:07:50.450 --> 02:07:50.460 align:start position:0%
businesses that were closed and you know
 
02:07:51.709 --> 02:07:51.719 align:start position:0%
people that literally couldn't get paid
 
02:07:53.330 --> 02:07:53.340 align:start position:0%
that we started to pay a lot of
 
02:07:56.589 --> 02:07:56.599 align:start position:0%
attention not you know also ESG concerns
 
02:07:59.390 --> 02:07:59.400 align:start position:0%
uh environmental concerns started to to
 
02:08:02.930 --> 02:08:02.940 align:start position:0%
ramp up in our thinking that delivering
 
02:08:04.250 --> 02:08:04.260 align:start position:0%
and printing all this paper was very
 
02:08:06.109 --> 02:08:06.119 align:start position:0%
very costly and
 
02:08:09.470 --> 02:08:09.480 align:start position:0%
so that's our primary concern
 
02:08:11.510 --> 02:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
is not the not the revenue there's not a
 
02:08:12.649 --> 02:08:12.659 align:start position:0%
lot of money to be made in the swipe
 
02:08:12.659 --> 02:08:13.609 align:start position:0%
lot of money to be made in the swipe
fees

02:08:13.609 --> 02:08:13.619 align:start position:0%
fees
 
02:08:15.530 --> 02:08:15.540 align:start position:0%
really okay
 
02:08:18.649 --> 02:08:18.659 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
02:08:18.659 --> 02:08:20.390 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
McKenzie

02:08:20.390 --> 02:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
McKenzie
 
02:08:23.689 --> 02:08:23.699 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I some of this may
 
02:08:28.250 --> 02:08:28.260 align:start position:0%
be better in front of uh Rudy but
 
02:08:31.129 --> 02:08:31.139 align:start position:0%
so under the current scenario
 
02:08:31.139 --> 02:08:32.330 align:start position:0%
so under the current scenario
um

02:08:32.330 --> 02:08:32.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:35.510 --> 02:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
if cash employers people who normally
 
02:08:37.129 --> 02:08:37.139 align:start position:0%
get paid by cash
 
02:08:40.010 --> 02:08:40.020 align:start position:0%
the employee can now go to the employee
 
02:08:41.990 --> 02:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
and say no we're not going to pay you by
 
02:08:44.510 --> 02:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
cash it's going to be electronic
 
02:08:44.520 --> 02:08:45.890 align:start position:0%
cash it's going to be electronic
correct

02:08:45.890 --> 02:08:45.900 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:08:48.709 --> 02:08:48.719 align:start position:0%
uh yes uh it could be I think most
 
02:08:51.050 --> 02:08:51.060 align:start position:0%
employers would just usually apply this
 
02:08:53.750 --> 02:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
on a prospective basis for new hires
 
02:08:54.950 --> 02:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
after a certain date they would get
 
02:08:58.070 --> 02:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
electronic follow-up
 
02:09:02.600 --> 02:09:02.610 align:start position:0%
um there are a number of employees who
 
02:09:02.610 --> 02:09:04.370 align:start position:0%
um there are a number of employees who
[Music]

02:09:04.370 --> 02:09:04.380 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:09:06.370 --> 02:09:06.380 align:start position:0%
go to check cashing services
 
02:09:08.990 --> 02:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
specifically to send money to families
 
02:09:11.890 --> 02:09:11.900 align:start position:0%
around the country around the world
 
02:09:14.629 --> 02:09:14.639 align:start position:0%
the debit cards
 
02:09:16.490 --> 02:09:16.500 align:start position:0%
can you go to a check cashing company
 
02:09:20.030 --> 02:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
and use a debit card such as yours you
 
02:09:21.350 --> 02:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
could there would probably be a fee
 
02:09:22.729 --> 02:09:22.739 align:start position:0%
associated with that I think that the
 
02:09:25.370 --> 02:09:25.380 align:start position:0%
debit cards were really intended to
 
02:09:27.470 --> 02:09:27.480 align:start position:0%
avoid the check cashers
 
02:09:29.629 --> 02:09:29.639 align:start position:0%
but if somebody wanted to use them to
 
02:09:31.129 --> 02:09:31.139 align:start position:0%
move money overseas or something then
 
02:09:33.290 --> 02:09:33.300 align:start position:0%
they could certainly do that and one
 
02:09:35.089 --> 02:09:35.099 align:start position:0%
final question
 
02:09:37.370 --> 02:09:37.380 align:start position:0%
uh what if you don't have a bank account
 
02:09:40.330 --> 02:09:40.340 align:start position:0%
at all and you don't have an ID right
 
02:09:42.109 --> 02:09:42.119 align:start position:0%
driver's license
 
02:09:45.109 --> 02:09:45.119 align:start position:0%
sure um if you were able to get a job
 
02:09:47.810 --> 02:09:47.820 align:start position:0%
the employer can issue you a debit card
 
02:09:49.729 --> 02:09:49.739 align:start position:0%
and that is a functional equivalent of a
 
02:09:51.050 --> 02:09:51.060 align:start position:0%
bank account so you essentially have a
 
02:09:53.209 --> 02:09:53.219 align:start position:0%
bank account even if you don't have the
 
02:09:56.750 --> 02:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
ID that Banks normally would ask for
 
02:09:59.510 --> 02:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you and I'm going to go
 
02:10:01.430 --> 02:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
around before I come back start the
 
02:10:04.250 --> 02:10:04.260 align:start position:0%
second question round uh over here and
 
02:10:05.030 --> 02:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
then I'll come back to you
 
02:10:06.890 --> 02:10:06.900 align:start position:0%
representative Granger
 
02:10:10.310 --> 02:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr Mr chair so I buy a
 
02:10:12.589 --> 02:10:12.599 align:start position:0%
ridiculous amount of guns and a
 
02:10:14.750 --> 02:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
ridiculous amount of ammo and one thing
 
02:10:16.310 --> 02:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
that we've been noticing lately in the
 
02:10:18.290 --> 02:10:18.300 align:start position:0%
firearm Community is that a lot of
 
02:10:20.390 --> 02:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
electronic Banks and electronic
 
02:10:23.629 --> 02:10:23.639 align:start position:0%
Financial Services providers will refuse
 
02:10:26.089 --> 02:10:26.099 align:start position:0%
to engage in transactions for perfectly
 
02:10:28.850 --> 02:10:28.860 align:start position:0%
legal activities we're also seeing this
 
02:10:30.709 --> 02:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
in other states that have legalized
 
02:10:32.209 --> 02:10:32.219 align:start position:0%
certain drugs certain banks are
 
02:10:34.270 --> 02:10:34.280 align:start position:0%
unwilling to engage in those practices
 
02:10:37.430 --> 02:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
so would this legis I don't so I see
 
02:10:39.530 --> 02:10:39.540 align:start position:0%
that there are certain protections if
 
02:10:41.930 --> 02:10:41.940 align:start position:0%
employees are unable to access their
 
02:10:44.390 --> 02:10:44.400 align:start position:0%
funds does that also extend if the bank
 
02:10:46.970 --> 02:10:46.980 align:start position:0%
this uh whoever is backing this debit
 
02:10:48.950 --> 02:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
card doesn't want to provide the money
 
02:10:53.750 --> 02:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:55.129 --> 02:10:55.139 align:start position:0%
um that's a good question I'm really not
 
02:10:57.470 --> 02:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
sure how that works or what types of
 
02:10:58.970 --> 02:10:58.980 align:start position:0%
businesses might be blocked from the
 
02:11:00.830 --> 02:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
electronic banking system other
 
02:11:03.350 --> 02:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
marijuana distributorships might be a
 
02:11:05.089 --> 02:11:05.099 align:start position:0%
good example
 
02:11:05.099 --> 02:11:05.810 align:start position:0%
good example
um

02:11:05.810 --> 02:11:05.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:08.810 --> 02:11:08.820 align:start position:0%
so I'm not that may be an issue
 
02:11:10.430 --> 02:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:11:12.770 --> 02:11:12.780 align:start position:0%
representative and thank you Mr chairman
 
02:11:16.609 --> 02:11:16.619 align:start position:0%
so people who have automatic deductions
 
02:11:17.810 --> 02:11:17.820 align:start position:0%
every month
 
02:11:19.790 --> 02:11:19.800 align:start position:0%
they would deduct from here like they
 
02:11:23.149 --> 02:11:23.159 align:start position:0%
would at debit card like child support
 
02:11:23.159 --> 02:11:25.250 align:start position:0%
would at debit card like child support
um

02:11:25.250 --> 02:11:25.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:27.229 --> 02:11:27.239 align:start position:0%
I I give to
 
02:11:29.450 --> 02:11:29.460 align:start position:0%
um like the children's hospitals they
 
02:11:32.450 --> 02:11:32.460 align:start position:0%
take a check a little bit every month
 
02:11:34.669 --> 02:11:34.679 align:start position:0%
that would come out of this just like
 
02:11:37.189 --> 02:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
they would take it out of my debit card
 
02:11:40.669 --> 02:11:40.679 align:start position:0%
account yes exactly you still receive if
 
02:11:42.050 --> 02:11:42.060 align:start position:0%
you have a debit card as your form of
 
02:11:43.970 --> 02:11:43.980 align:start position:0%
payment you still receive a statement of
 
02:11:45.649 --> 02:11:45.659 align:start position:0%
deductions which tells you you know the
 
02:11:48.290 --> 02:11:48.300 align:start position:0%
amount of hours that you had and your
 
02:11:50.750 --> 02:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
your pay rate and the gross amount you
 
02:11:52.609 --> 02:11:52.619 align:start position:0%
received in the taxes amount this that
 
02:11:54.530 --> 02:11:54.540 align:start position:0%
were deducted in any you know voluntary
 
02:11:55.790 --> 02:11:55.800 align:start position:0%
deductions and things like that so you
 
02:11:57.709 --> 02:11:57.719 align:start position:0%
still get that statement you get that
 
02:11:59.030 --> 02:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
electronically and it's you know pretty
 
02:12:01.609 --> 02:12:01.619 align:start position:0%
easy to deal with as well
 
02:12:04.010 --> 02:12:04.020 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:12:06.589 --> 02:12:06.599 align:start position:0%
representative online
 
02:12:08.570 --> 02:12:08.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um this is the
 
02:12:11.390 --> 02:12:11.400 align:start position:0%
second time we've seen this and um
 
02:12:13.370 --> 02:12:13.380 align:start position:0%
it still has the same problems that we
 
02:12:15.290 --> 02:12:15.300 align:start position:0%
had the last time
 
02:12:17.750 --> 02:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
um so if you have you worked with the
 
02:12:19.910 --> 02:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
proponents to get this language changed
 
02:12:23.089 --> 02:12:23.099 align:start position:0%
from our last iteration of this or is
 
02:12:25.070 --> 02:12:25.080 align:start position:0%
this just the same retread that we're
 
02:12:26.689 --> 02:12:26.699 align:start position:0%
going to look at again
 
02:12:29.270 --> 02:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
um there is a slight revision to it but
 
02:12:31.490 --> 02:12:31.500 align:start position:0%
I'm not really recalling um and I'm not
 
02:12:33.410 --> 02:12:33.420 align:start position:0%
sure it was ever elaborated what the
 
02:12:35.629 --> 02:12:35.639 align:start position:0%
concerns were with a bill we were a
 
02:12:37.490 --> 02:12:37.500 align:start position:0%
little surprised that it was not
 
02:12:37.500 --> 02:12:38.510 align:start position:0%
little surprised that it was not
approved

02:12:38.510 --> 02:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
approved
 
02:12:41.689 --> 02:12:41.699 align:start position:0%
but I never really understood why
 
02:12:41.699 --> 02:12:42.950 align:start position:0%
but I never really understood why
okay

02:12:42.950 --> 02:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:12:45.709 --> 02:12:45.719 align:start position:0%
um so I would just follow our little
 
02:12:47.689 --> 02:12:47.699 align:start position:0%
latitude Mr chairman
 
02:12:49.430 --> 02:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
a little bit
 
02:12:50.810 --> 02:12:50.820 align:start position:0%
um the debit cards that you speak of
 
02:12:52.370 --> 02:12:52.380 align:start position:0%
those issued by your company that are
 
02:12:53.870 --> 02:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
backed by a bank that you do business
 
02:12:55.729 --> 02:12:55.739 align:start position:0%
with is that correct yeah so it's not
 
02:12:59.270 --> 02:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
technically the employee's bank account
 
02:13:00.950 --> 02:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
um it's the employees account though as
 
02:13:03.169 --> 02:13:03.179 align:start position:0%
much as any bank account belongs to any
 
02:13:05.510 --> 02:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
person that has a bank account
 
02:13:07.729 --> 02:13:07.739 align:start position:0%
so they would be required to show ID to
 
02:13:08.990 --> 02:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
the bank issuing bank and everything
 
02:13:10.669 --> 02:13:10.679 align:start position:0%
else in order to have that account
 
02:13:13.069 --> 02:13:13.079 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry say it again when I walk into
 
02:13:14.450 --> 02:13:14.460 align:start position:0%
an open an account I have to show ID
 
02:13:15.709 --> 02:13:15.719 align:start position:0%
fill up paperwork and everything else
 
02:13:17.629 --> 02:13:17.639 align:start position:0%
and that's my bank account right if an
 
02:13:20.450 --> 02:13:20.460 align:start position:0%
employer is issuing a debit card that
 
02:13:22.490 --> 02:13:22.500 align:start position:0%
it's not drawn on the Employees bank
 
02:13:26.030 --> 02:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
right um yeah there is uh if you want to
 
02:13:28.310 --> 02:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
take this card and make it
 
02:13:30.830 --> 02:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
um portable
 
02:13:32.569 --> 02:13:32.579 align:start position:0%
um so you can accept deposits from other
 
02:13:34.550 --> 02:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
than the employer you can do that but
 
02:13:35.990 --> 02:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
you do have to walk into a bank and show
 
02:13:37.850 --> 02:13:37.860 align:start position:0%
ID and they you know basically upgrade
 
02:13:39.830 --> 02:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
the card to permit
 
02:13:39.840 --> 02:13:41.810 align:start position:0%
the card to permit
um portability

02:13:41.810 --> 02:13:41.820 align:start position:0%
um portability
 
02:13:43.550 --> 02:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
but you know if all you're doing is
 
02:13:45.350 --> 02:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
receiving uh payments of wages from the
 
02:13:47.450 --> 02:13:47.460 align:start position:0%
employer there's really no need to show
 
02:13:49.609 --> 02:13:49.619 align:start position:0%
identification or you know get verified
 
02:13:51.589 --> 02:13:51.599 align:start position:0%
through the know your customer kind of
 
02:13:52.910 --> 02:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
regime through
 
02:13:52.920 --> 02:13:54.410 align:start position:0%
regime through
the banks

02:13:54.410 --> 02:13:54.420 align:start position:0%
the banks
 
02:13:56.689 --> 02:13:56.699 align:start position:0%
if that makes sense it does
 
02:13:59.149 --> 02:13:59.159 align:start position:0%
um and I'll get to the and the fees
 
02:14:01.729 --> 02:14:01.739 align:start position:0%
that'll follow up Mr chairman the fees
 
02:14:03.530 --> 02:14:03.540 align:start position:0%
that are associated with that as well if
 
02:14:04.790 --> 02:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
they don't use it for portability and
 
02:14:06.169 --> 02:14:06.179 align:start position:0%
they use it as a checking account but
 
02:14:07.250 --> 02:14:07.260 align:start position:0%
basically it's not their checking
 
02:14:08.810 --> 02:14:08.820 align:start position:0%
account they're using it to draw funds
 
02:14:10.010 --> 02:14:10.020 align:start position:0%
through your account
 
02:14:12.290 --> 02:14:12.300 align:start position:0%
is there fees associated with that and
 
02:14:14.390 --> 02:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
the The Limited availability for those
 
02:14:14.400 --> 02:14:15.589 align:start position:0%
the The Limited availability for those
funds

02:14:15.589 --> 02:14:15.599 align:start position:0%
funds
 
02:14:18.709 --> 02:14:18.719 align:start position:0%
no I mean these um the net amount of
 
02:14:20.689 --> 02:14:20.699 align:start position:0%
wages are deposited onto these card
 
02:14:23.149 --> 02:14:23.159 align:start position:0%
accounts and you know they can be used
 
02:14:25.010 --> 02:14:25.020 align:start position:0%
in whatever way there's uh free bill
 
02:14:27.169 --> 02:14:27.179 align:start position:0%
payment services you could access online
 
02:14:28.850 --> 02:14:28.860 align:start position:0%
to to make payments from your card
 
02:14:31.609 --> 02:14:31.619 align:start position:0%
account for example or withdraw cash or
 
02:14:33.709 --> 02:14:33.719 align:start position:0%
you know use it like a debit card at a
 
02:14:33.719 --> 02:14:34.790 align:start position:0%
you know use it like a debit card at a
retailer

02:14:34.790 --> 02:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
retailer
 
02:14:38.589 --> 02:14:38.599 align:start position:0%
there's no fee for any of that okay and
 
02:14:41.089 --> 02:14:41.099 align:start position:0%
so this is basically this is tailored
 
02:14:42.830 --> 02:14:42.840 align:start position:0%
for your company which is ADP which is a
 
02:14:44.089 --> 02:14:44.099 align:start position:0%
large multi
 
02:14:46.430 --> 02:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
Nationwide company what about the mama
 
02:14:50.270 --> 02:14:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:51.950 --> 02:14:51.960 align:start position:0%
um they can certainly continue to offer
 
02:14:54.229 --> 02:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
paper checks and they were not requiring
 
02:14:56.149 --> 02:14:56.159 align:start position:0%
employers to um to stop offering paper
 
02:14:58.370 --> 02:14:58.380 align:start position:0%
checks we're just saying that employers
 
02:15:01.069 --> 02:15:01.079 align:start position:0%
prefer to pay electronically they should
 
02:15:04.870 --> 02:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:07.609 --> 02:15:07.619 align:start position:0%
protects we discontinued
 
02:15:10.790 --> 02:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
no no no the paper checks would continue
 
02:15:13.310 --> 02:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
to be offered for if any in for example
 
02:15:14.390 --> 02:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
if you have a collective bargaining
 
02:15:16.550 --> 02:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
agreement any employer that has a cab
 
02:15:18.350 --> 02:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
would probably just continue offering
 
02:15:19.669 --> 02:15:19.679 align:start position:0%
paper checks because they you know they
 
02:15:21.290 --> 02:15:21.300 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to make that a an issue to
 
02:15:23.149 --> 02:15:23.159 align:start position:0%
negotiate with the Union
 
02:15:24.770 --> 02:15:24.780 align:start position:0%
but any employer can just continue
 
02:15:28.669 --> 02:15:28.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:30.950 --> 02:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
since I'm getting a look I'll say
 
02:15:33.050 --> 02:15:33.060 align:start position:0%
something having heard this bill a
 
02:15:34.430 --> 02:15:34.440 align:start position:0%
number of times that hopefully is
 
02:15:38.629 --> 02:15:38.639 align:start position:0%
clarifying what this change would do is
 
02:15:41.990 --> 02:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
it's on the employee and what the
 
02:15:44.450 --> 02:15:44.460 align:start position:0%
employee can demand
 
02:15:47.930 --> 02:15:47.940 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't affect what the employer
 
02:15:51.109 --> 02:15:51.119 align:start position:0%
can offer and if the employee an
 
02:15:55.430 --> 02:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
employer agree to any of the allowed
 
02:15:57.950 --> 02:15:57.960 align:start position:0%
payments that can continue
 
02:16:00.830 --> 02:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
what this changes is right now if there
 
02:16:02.750 --> 02:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
is no agreement between employer and
 
02:16:05.330 --> 02:16:05.340 align:start position:0%
employee the employee can demand a paper
 
02:16:07.729 --> 02:16:07.739 align:start position:0%
check and the employer must offer that
 
02:16:12.770 --> 02:16:12.780 align:start position:0%
this would remove that requirement
 
02:16:14.990 --> 02:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
and allow
 
02:16:17.689 --> 02:16:17.699 align:start position:0%
in lieu of a paper check the employer
 
02:16:20.629 --> 02:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
could say you know what I'm not gonna I
 
02:16:22.930 --> 02:16:22.940 align:start position:0%
don't offer that paper check
 
02:16:25.310 --> 02:16:25.320 align:start position:0%
if you if you don't have a bank account
 
02:16:28.010 --> 02:16:28.020 align:start position:0%
we do electronic deposit if you don't
 
02:16:30.709 --> 02:16:30.719 align:start position:0%
have a bank account then the payroll
 
02:16:32.509 --> 02:16:32.519 align:start position:0%
card is your option
 
02:16:35.450 --> 02:16:35.460 align:start position:0%
so I hope that is clarifying for the new
 
02:16:37.129 --> 02:16:37.139 align:start position:0%
people and I hope that doesn't conflict
 
02:16:41.690 --> 02:16:41.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:44.209 --> 02:16:44.219 align:start position:0%
thank you all right
 
02:16:46.730 --> 02:16:46.740 align:start position:0%
um I have a question and it's I I heard
 
02:16:49.009 --> 02:16:49.019 align:start position:0%
you mentioned something that we talked
 
02:16:51.410 --> 02:16:51.420 align:start position:0%
about last year and so if you could
 
02:16:56.570 --> 02:16:56.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:00.650 --> 02:17:00.660 align:start position:0%
if I have direct deposit I might get a
 
02:17:03.349 --> 02:17:03.359 align:start position:0%
paper uh
 
02:17:05.570 --> 02:17:05.580 align:start position:0%
form in the mail that tells me what was
 
02:17:08.570 --> 02:17:08.580 align:start position:0%
deposited what was deducted in the case
 
02:17:11.209 --> 02:17:11.219 align:start position:0%
of a payroll card particularly one
 
02:17:13.669 --> 02:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
that's trying to avoid that exchange of
 
02:17:16.849 --> 02:17:16.859 align:start position:0%
paper how does that work how does the
 
02:17:16.859 --> 02:17:18.429 align:start position:0%
paper how does that work how does the
the

02:17:18.429 --> 02:17:18.439 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:17:21.349 --> 02:17:21.359 align:start position:0%
information for the employer about what
 
02:17:23.389 --> 02:17:23.399 align:start position:0%
he or she has been paid get transmitted
 
02:17:25.190 --> 02:17:25.200 align:start position:0%
right with each pay period every
 
02:17:26.570 --> 02:17:26.580 align:start position:0%
employee continues to get a pay
 
02:17:29.089 --> 02:17:29.099 align:start position:0%
statement that says hey for this last
 
02:17:31.910 --> 02:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
two weeks you worked these hours you
 
02:17:33.530 --> 02:17:33.540 align:start position:0%
were paid this gross amount and here are
 
02:17:35.030 --> 02:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
your deductions the taxes and other
 
02:17:37.610 --> 02:17:37.620 align:start position:0%
deductions so the way that they get that
 
02:17:39.349 --> 02:17:39.359 align:start position:0%
is through their employer portal
 
02:17:41.270 --> 02:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
typically it's electronic it's it's
 
02:17:43.070 --> 02:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
hosted on a secure website which is
 
02:17:45.049 --> 02:17:45.059 align:start position:0%
pretty easy for employees to deal with
 
02:17:47.209 --> 02:17:47.219 align:start position:0%
they already use these portals to for
 
02:17:49.849 --> 02:17:49.859 align:start position:0%
example enroll in benefits and and you
 
02:17:50.929 --> 02:17:50.939 align:start position:0%
know receive a lot of other
 
02:17:52.730 --> 02:17:52.740 align:start position:0%
Communications from the employer their
 
02:17:54.830 --> 02:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
form W-2 things like that it's all
 
02:17:57.110 --> 02:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
posted electronically it's very
 
02:17:58.549 --> 02:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
helpful from the perspective of
 
02:18:00.049 --> 02:18:00.059 align:start position:0%
employees don't have to keep track of
 
02:18:02.270 --> 02:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
paper which they often lose they can
 
02:18:03.709 --> 02:18:03.719 align:start position:0%
just you know if they need something two
 
02:18:05.330 --> 02:18:05.340 align:start position:0%
or three years from now they can go back
 
02:18:06.830 --> 02:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
and say well you know let me just look
 
02:18:09.950 --> 02:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
up on the portal to get my W-2 from 2000
 
02:18:12.770 --> 02:18:12.780 align:start position:0%
or my pay statement from December and
 
02:18:15.349 --> 02:18:15.359 align:start position:0%
it's all there for them but those same
 
02:18:17.629 --> 02:18:17.639 align:start position:0%
statements are available those are also
 
02:18:19.849 --> 02:18:19.859 align:start position:0%
available for former employees
 
02:18:22.310 --> 02:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
the the systems were designed to permit
 
02:18:24.049 --> 02:18:24.059 align:start position:0%
you know ongoing access to anybody who
 
02:18:25.969 --> 02:18:25.979 align:start position:0%
was previously an employee and has those
 
02:18:29.209 --> 02:18:29.219 align:start position:0%
records for for easy access
 
02:18:31.849 --> 02:18:31.859 align:start position:0%
all right thank you uh we have some
 
02:18:34.190 --> 02:18:34.200 align:start position:0%
other follow-up questions I'll start
 
02:18:36.709 --> 02:18:36.719 align:start position:0%
over here again represent Broody thank
 
02:18:39.349 --> 02:18:39.359 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman so
 
02:18:41.750 --> 02:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
if this isn't a bank
 
02:18:46.490 --> 02:18:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:48.830 --> 02:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
um it is a bank in the these cards must
 
02:18:51.589 --> 02:18:51.599 align:start position:0%
be insured by the FDIC at cardholder
 
02:18:51.599 --> 02:18:52.790 align:start position:0%
be insured by the FDIC at cardholder
level

02:18:52.790 --> 02:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
level
 
02:18:56.870 --> 02:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
so yes they are in FDIC insured well and
 
02:19:00.410 --> 02:19:00.420 align:start position:0%
what level is that if I if I don't spend
 
02:19:02.570 --> 02:19:02.580 align:start position:0%
all my money every week and I have a
 
02:19:06.230 --> 02:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
nice Nest Egg there and somebody walks
 
02:19:07.969 --> 02:19:07.979 align:start position:0%
off with it all I've seen a big company
 
02:19:11.690 --> 02:19:11.700 align:start position:0%
do that if the bank fails FDIC will
 
02:19:15.169 --> 02:19:15.179 align:start position:0%
cover um up to 250 000 and they just a
 
02:19:16.969 --> 02:19:16.979 align:start position:0%
couple weeks ago uh expanded that
 
02:19:19.129 --> 02:19:19.139 align:start position:0%
dramatically for Silicon Valley Bank and
 
02:19:22.669 --> 02:19:22.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:24.469 --> 02:19:24.479 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:19:26.990 --> 02:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
representative Cahill thank you Mr
 
02:19:29.629 --> 02:19:29.639 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you uh so if this
 
02:19:32.950 --> 02:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
bill were to pass then accepting either
 
02:19:38.690 --> 02:19:38.700 align:start position:0%
the uh the the digit the card or uh a a
 
02:19:40.610 --> 02:19:40.620 align:start position:0%
bank account in your own direct deposit
 
02:19:45.049 --> 02:19:45.059 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:46.549 --> 02:19:46.559 align:start position:0%
um yes essentially yes
 
02:19:48.830 --> 02:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you
 
02:19:51.889 --> 02:19:51.899 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie
 
02:19:53.450 --> 02:19:53.460 align:start position:0%
could you uh
 
02:19:56.929 --> 02:19:56.939 align:start position:0%
Define what what network means and how
 
02:19:58.790 --> 02:19:58.800 align:start position:0%
to network in network
 
02:20:01.790 --> 02:20:01.800 align:start position:0%
um okay and think about it I think in
 
02:20:03.590 --> 02:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
terms of the State of New Hampshire many
 
02:20:05.570 --> 02:20:05.580 align:start position:0%
places where there was not a whole lot
 
02:20:07.730 --> 02:20:07.740 align:start position:0%
around right so
 
02:20:09.770 --> 02:20:09.780 align:start position:0%
no it's a good question it's a point to
 
02:20:11.630 --> 02:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
confusion for everyone
 
02:20:13.310 --> 02:20:13.320 align:start position:0%
um like if you look at the back of any
 
02:20:15.349 --> 02:20:15.359 align:start position:0%
debit card it'll show like uh the
 
02:20:16.849 --> 02:20:16.859 align:start position:0%
networks that it's associated with like
 
02:20:19.550 --> 02:20:19.560 align:start position:0%
Allpoint and star and others and if you
 
02:20:22.070 --> 02:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
see go to an ATM they have logos of all
 
02:20:23.510 --> 02:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
the networks that they're associated
 
02:20:27.410 --> 02:20:27.420 align:start position:0%
with so you know it's it's
 
02:20:29.030 --> 02:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
you have to look at the card to see what
 
02:20:31.250 --> 02:20:31.260 align:start position:0%
network you're in understand
 
02:20:33.230 --> 02:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
um you know where which are you facing
 
02:20:34.969 --> 02:20:34.979 align:start position:0%
an ATM that is in that Network and if so
 
02:20:37.190 --> 02:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
there's no fee and again there's a an
 
02:20:39.830 --> 02:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
easy Bank app that you can just look up
 
02:20:41.330 --> 02:20:41.340 align:start position:0%
and say where's the free their nearest
 
02:20:43.670 --> 02:20:43.680 align:start position:0%
free ATM and it'll show you exactly
 
02:20:48.050 --> 02:20:48.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:51.349 --> 02:20:51.359 align:start position:0%
so a person needs a phone
 
02:20:53.270 --> 02:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
they need to be able to access portals
 
02:20:55.070 --> 02:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
they need to be able to go to the phone
 
02:20:56.750 --> 02:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
to find out what the ATM machines are
 
02:21:00.050 --> 02:21:00.060 align:start position:0%
and then they run the risk of um of not
 
02:21:02.330 --> 02:21:02.340 align:start position:0%
being in a network if they are in some
 
02:21:06.050 --> 02:21:06.060 align:start position:0%
place in remote New Hampshire correct
 
02:21:07.910 --> 02:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
yes that's true and again you could
 
02:21:10.070 --> 02:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
assuming there's a bank available they
 
02:21:11.570 --> 02:21:11.580 align:start position:0%
can walk into any bank and just ask for
 
02:21:13.910 --> 02:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
the full amount in cash but otherwise
 
02:21:15.889 --> 02:21:15.899 align:start position:0%
yeah the employer oftentimes for for
 
02:21:17.210 --> 02:21:17.220 align:start position:0%
people who you know are just not
 
02:21:18.590 --> 02:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
computer savvy they don't usually work
 
02:21:20.929 --> 02:21:20.939 align:start position:0%
with computers at all uh employers will
 
02:21:22.730 --> 02:21:22.740 align:start position:0%
usually have a kiosk or some means for
 
02:21:24.889 --> 02:21:24.899 align:start position:0%
to go into the office when they visit to
 
02:21:26.150 --> 02:21:26.160 align:start position:0%
print anything that they want look
 
02:21:32.530 --> 02:21:32.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:34.790 --> 02:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
representative Leclair
 
02:21:34.800 --> 02:21:35.990 align:start position:0%
representative Leclair
thanks

02:21:35.990 --> 02:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
02:21:38.389 --> 02:21:38.399 align:start position:0%
just to follow up on a couple of my
 
02:21:41.090 --> 02:21:41.100 align:start position:0%
representative colleagues here
 
02:21:44.270 --> 02:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
about the ID thing and and
 
02:21:46.070 --> 02:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
say I found a card
 
02:21:47.510 --> 02:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
I didn't know what the balance was I'm
 
02:21:50.090 --> 02:21:50.100 align:start position:0%
going to walk into a bank Yep this is my
 
02:21:51.950 --> 02:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
card if I don't have to show ID or
 
02:21:54.110 --> 02:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
anything they're just gonna
 
02:21:56.929 --> 02:21:56.939 align:start position:0%
cash up for me
 
02:21:58.730 --> 02:21:58.740 align:start position:0%
yeah they're required to
 
02:22:00.590 --> 02:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
um but it's a good question I mean if I
 
02:22:02.030 --> 02:22:02.040 align:start position:0%
was a bank teller I kind of want to see
 
02:22:05.270 --> 02:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
ID I guess yeah and I get that but you
 
02:22:06.770 --> 02:22:06.780 align:start position:0%
kind of said that you didn't I'm sorry
 
02:22:09.050 --> 02:22:09.060 align:start position:0%
follow up if I could but you kind of
 
02:22:11.389 --> 02:22:11.399 align:start position:0%
said that um it wasn't necessary
 
02:22:14.210 --> 02:22:14.220 align:start position:0%
necessary yeah the um essentially the
 
02:22:15.770 --> 02:22:15.780 align:start position:0%
banks are deferring to employers to
 
02:22:18.110 --> 02:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
issue these cards to to say that these
 
02:22:20.270 --> 02:22:20.280 align:start position:0%
you know employees have been vetted that
 
02:22:21.889 --> 02:22:21.899 align:start position:0%
they know who they are that they're you
 
02:22:23.330 --> 02:22:23.340 align:start position:0%
know U.S citizens eligible for
 
02:22:23.340 --> 02:22:24.650 align:start position:0%
know U.S citizens eligible for
employment

02:22:24.650 --> 02:22:24.660 align:start position:0%
employment
 
02:22:25.969 --> 02:22:25.979 align:start position:0%
um and so the issue occurred on that
 
02:22:28.309 --> 02:22:28.319 align:start position:0%
basis but they're not portable cards
 
02:22:29.750 --> 02:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
they can't accept deposits from other
 
02:22:31.969 --> 02:22:31.979 align:start position:0%
sources other than the employer unless
 
02:22:33.889 --> 02:22:33.899 align:start position:0%
they walk into a bank with ID and get it
 
02:22:33.899 --> 02:22:37.210 align:start position:0%
they walk into a bank with ID and get it
verified

02:22:37.210 --> 02:22:37.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:39.410 --> 02:22:39.420 align:start position:0%
yeah and I understand that that's for a
 
02:22:41.090 --> 02:22:41.100 align:start position:0%
deposit what if I just want to cash it
 
02:22:43.730 --> 02:22:43.740 align:start position:0%
if I found one of my Representatives
 
02:22:46.790 --> 02:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
wallets and stole it and took it and you
 
02:22:48.050 --> 02:22:48.060 align:start position:0%
know I'm not the nicest person in the
 
02:22:49.849 --> 02:22:49.859 align:start position:0%
world and I just try to cash a check or
 
02:22:52.190 --> 02:22:52.200 align:start position:0%
cash my debit card out yeah this is me
 
02:22:54.110 --> 02:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
this is me Bob Smith right here you know
 
02:22:56.330 --> 02:22:56.340 align:start position:0%
I don't have my ID with me and this is
 
02:22:57.950 --> 02:22:57.960 align:start position:0%
who I work for and I suspect you're
 
02:22:59.510 --> 02:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
right if you walked into a bank that you
 
02:23:00.650 --> 02:23:00.660 align:start position:0%
didn't have an account in and they
 
02:23:01.790 --> 02:23:01.800 align:start position:0%
didn't know you and they'd probably
 
02:23:04.190 --> 02:23:04.200 align:start position:0%
asking for ID yes and you're saying
 
02:23:06.349 --> 02:23:06.359 align:start position:0%
though that it wasn't be necessary uh
 
02:23:07.849 --> 02:23:07.859 align:start position:0%
it's not necessary for issuance of the
 
02:23:10.070 --> 02:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
card but yeah if you if you just found a
 
02:23:12.110 --> 02:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
card on the sidewalk
 
02:23:13.610 --> 02:23:13.620 align:start position:0%
um yeah you may have difficulty actually
 
02:23:16.610 --> 02:23:16.620 align:start position:0%
using it yeah but and that's I
 
02:23:17.870 --> 02:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate that and I'd like that to
 
02:23:19.190 --> 02:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
happen but it didn't sound like that was
 
02:23:21.349 --> 02:23:21.359 align:start position:0%
the case yeah it said
 
02:23:22.969 --> 02:23:22.979 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of issuing the card
 
02:23:25.490 --> 02:23:25.500 align:start position:0%
versus in front of a check uh bank
 
02:23:26.630 --> 02:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
teller who may be a different question
 
02:23:29.150 --> 02:23:29.160 align:start position:0%
you probably need ID
 
02:23:38.150 --> 02:23:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:40.010 --> 02:23:40.020 align:start position:0%
going back to
 
02:23:42.590 --> 02:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
sorry I got distracted I apologize so
 
02:23:44.690 --> 02:23:44.700 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question going
 
02:23:47.150 --> 02:23:47.160 align:start position:0%
back to the issue of
 
02:23:49.790 --> 02:23:49.800 align:start position:0%
um separation with employer
 
02:23:52.370 --> 02:23:52.380 align:start position:0%
currently with an HSA account I
 
02:23:54.230 --> 02:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
separated from my employer
 
02:23:56.630 --> 02:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
I now have to cover the fees on that HSA
 
02:23:58.010 --> 02:23:58.020 align:start position:0%
account for managing that account
 
02:24:00.230 --> 02:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
because I'm no longer with that employer
 
02:24:03.290 --> 02:24:03.300 align:start position:0%
so my concern with this card is if I
 
02:24:04.910 --> 02:24:04.920 align:start position:0%
separate from that employer and I choose
 
02:24:06.469 --> 02:24:06.479 align:start position:0%
not to go back to work I'm retired or
 
02:24:09.530 --> 02:24:09.540 align:start position:0%
whatever at what point in time if ever
 
02:24:11.929 --> 02:24:11.939 align:start position:0%
is there going to be a charge for them
 
02:24:14.150 --> 02:24:14.160 align:start position:0%
to manage my account because there's no
 
02:24:16.010 --> 02:24:16.020 align:start position:0%
longer money coming in from the employer
 
02:24:20.870 --> 02:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:22.550 --> 02:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
um I don't believe there are ever any
 
02:24:25.910 --> 02:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
fees for that I mean these are just
 
02:24:28.849 --> 02:24:28.859 align:start position:0%
don't believe yeah I see it
 
02:24:31.370 --> 02:24:31.380 align:start position:0%
well another question if I may
 
02:24:31.380 --> 02:24:32.270 align:start position:0%
well another question if I may
um

02:24:32.270 --> 02:24:32.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:34.309 --> 02:24:34.319 align:start position:0%
shifting years
 
02:24:34.319 --> 02:24:34.849 align:start position:0%
shifting years
um

02:24:34.849 --> 02:24:34.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:37.250 --> 02:24:37.260 align:start position:0%
how how many reports do you guys have
 
02:24:40.730 --> 02:24:40.740 align:start position:0%
any data on how many reports there are
 
02:24:43.969 --> 02:24:43.979 align:start position:0%
of stolen cards lost cards money that's
 
02:24:45.530 --> 02:24:45.540 align:start position:0%
not available so I've gone to the
 
02:24:47.389 --> 02:24:47.399 align:start position:0%
grocery store to try to get my money and
 
02:24:48.770 --> 02:24:48.780 align:start position:0%
the grocery store says I don't have
 
02:24:50.809 --> 02:24:50.819 align:start position:0%
enough to give you so I can't get my
 
02:24:52.730 --> 02:24:52.740 align:start position:0%
money from a grocery store do you guys
 
02:24:54.590 --> 02:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
have data are you collecting data and
 
02:24:57.710 --> 02:24:57.720 align:start position:0%
trending what the reports are on these
 
02:24:57.720 --> 02:24:59.570 align:start position:0%
trending what the reports are on these
cards

02:24:59.570 --> 02:24:59.580 align:start position:0%
cards
 
02:25:02.090 --> 02:25:02.100 align:start position:0%
we do have some pretty uh detailed
 
02:25:04.550 --> 02:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
statistics on card usage and how people
 
02:25:06.349 --> 02:25:06.359 align:start position:0%
are using the cards
 
02:25:08.690 --> 02:25:08.700 align:start position:0%
um so I'd be glad to
 
02:25:10.070 --> 02:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
um you know take that back and and
 
02:25:11.750 --> 02:25:11.760 align:start position:0%

02:25:11.760 --> 02:25:13.070 align:start position:0%
provide any information if you have
specific

of those cards are are on uh the money
 
02:25:25.250 --> 02:25:25.260 align:start position:0%
is unavailable to the employees or how
 
02:25:27.230 --> 02:25:27.240 align:start position:0%
many of the cards have been lost and
 
02:25:28.790 --> 02:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
people have had a hard time getting them
 
02:25:28.800 --> 02:25:30.290 align:start position:0%
people have had a hard time getting them
replaced

02:25:30.290 --> 02:25:30.300 align:start position:0%
replaced
 
02:25:31.969 --> 02:25:31.979 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to know the data on how
 
02:25:33.530 --> 02:25:33.540 align:start position:0%
difficult that money has been for
 
02:25:38.210 --> 02:25:38.220 align:start position:0%

Commissioner

02:26:28.610 --> 02:26:28.620 align:start position:0%
Commissioner
 
02:26:31.309 --> 02:26:31.319 align:start position:0%
um so uh representative Granger brought
 
02:26:34.010 --> 02:26:34.020 align:start position:0%
up a a great Point earlier about um if
 
02:26:36.290 --> 02:26:36.300 align:start position:0%
it's a certain bank that doesn't allow a
 
02:26:38.450 --> 02:26:38.460 align:start position:0%
certain processes through a certain
 
02:26:41.330 --> 02:26:41.340 align:start position:0%
processing of debits to go through uh
 
02:26:43.250 --> 02:26:43.260 align:start position:0%
based on their ESG or whatever they're
 
02:26:45.910 --> 02:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
doing if it's marijuana
 
02:26:49.070 --> 02:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
Firearms liquor anything like that
 
02:26:50.510 --> 02:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
um would that be considered a processing
 
02:26:52.849 --> 02:26:52.859 align:start position:0%
defect on behalf of the bank and payroll
 
02:26:55.250 --> 02:26:55.260 align:start position:0%
company and then is the employer rely
 
02:26:58.370 --> 02:26:58.380 align:start position:0%
now liable for the remainder of that
 
02:27:01.429 --> 02:27:01.439 align:start position:0%
wages do not from the Department's
 
02:27:03.050 --> 02:27:03.060 align:start position:0%
perspective if I'm understanding the
 
02:27:04.730 --> 02:27:04.740 align:start position:0%
question uh correctly the department
 
02:27:07.070 --> 02:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
would look at this law and and with this
 
02:27:09.469 --> 02:27:09.479 align:start position:0%
change is saying essentially uh that
 
02:27:11.389 --> 02:27:11.399 align:start position:0%
really what the employer is on the hook
 
02:27:14.510 --> 02:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
for is making sure that a card provided
 
02:27:16.370 --> 02:27:16.380 align:start position:0%
the person being paid via payroll card
 
02:27:18.650 --> 02:27:18.660 align:start position:0%
has means of accessing their wages
 
02:27:21.530 --> 02:27:21.540 align:start position:0%
without a fee if I understood the
 
02:27:23.030 --> 02:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
scenario from representative Granger
 
02:27:24.490 --> 02:27:24.500 align:start position:0%
that you've just
 
02:27:27.230 --> 02:27:27.240 align:start position:0%
kind of come back to you're talking
 
02:27:30.410 --> 02:27:30.420 align:start position:0%
about doing purchases with the card in
 
02:27:32.570 --> 02:27:32.580 align:start position:0%
other types of transactions again we
 
02:27:35.389 --> 02:27:35.399 align:start position:0%
would be looking specifically were the
 
02:27:37.070 --> 02:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
wages there was the person able to
 
02:27:39.650 --> 02:27:39.660 align:start position:0%
access the money in in terms of take it
 
02:27:43.550 --> 02:27:43.560 align:start position:0%
in hand without a fee if if purchases
 
02:27:45.770 --> 02:27:45.780 align:start position:0%
were blocked we would not look at that
 
02:27:49.030 --> 02:27:49.040 align:start position:0%
as an interruption of their wages
 
02:27:52.250 --> 02:27:52.260 align:start position:0%
if that makes sense thank you and follow
 
02:27:54.590 --> 02:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
up Mr chairman uh Mr chairman
 
02:27:56.950 --> 02:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
um the 24 hours
 
02:27:59.389 --> 02:27:59.399 align:start position:0%
notification and then 24 hours to be
 
02:27:59.399 --> 02:28:00.370 align:start position:0%
notification and then 24 hours to be
replaced

02:28:00.370 --> 02:28:00.380 align:start position:0%
replaced
 
02:28:02.450 --> 02:28:02.460 align:start position:0%
representative Draco great off a great
 
02:28:04.370 --> 02:28:04.380 align:start position:0%
Point earlier and I want to reiterate
 
02:28:05.929 --> 02:28:05.939 align:start position:0%
that for
 
02:28:07.429 --> 02:28:07.439 align:start position:0%
um employee loses their card at midnight
 
02:28:11.090 --> 02:28:11.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:14.210 --> 02:28:14.220 align:start position:0%
you know ADP is closed checkmates closed
 
02:28:15.530 --> 02:28:15.540 align:start position:0%
every all the big guys are closed
 
02:28:16.370 --> 02:28:16.380 align:start position:0%
they're not going to get a car until
 
02:28:16.380 --> 02:28:17.330 align:start position:0%
they're not going to get a car until
Monday

02:28:17.330 --> 02:28:17.340 align:start position:0%
Monday
 
02:28:19.250 --> 02:28:19.260 align:start position:0%
how is that going to relate to the
 
02:28:21.710 --> 02:28:21.720 align:start position:0%
employer as presently drafted we would
 
02:28:23.510 --> 02:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
look at this and saying within 24 hours
 
02:28:25.730 --> 02:28:25.740 align:start position:0%
of being notified now we I guess in
 
02:28:27.770 --> 02:28:27.780 align:start position:0%
given situations we could say when did
 
02:28:30.050 --> 02:28:30.060 align:start position:0%
the notification actually happen but we
 
02:28:31.309 --> 02:28:31.319 align:start position:0%
would look at the present languages
 
02:28:34.270 --> 02:28:34.280 align:start position:0%
saying within 24 hours of being notified
 
02:28:37.370 --> 02:28:37.380 align:start position:0%
a card will be reissued I would
 
02:28:38.990 --> 02:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
highlight for that and I actually
 
02:28:40.849 --> 02:28:40.859 align:start position:0%
appreciate the inclusion of that
 
02:28:42.349 --> 02:28:42.359 align:start position:0%
language in there I've been at the
 
02:28:44.510 --> 02:28:44.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor about 10 years now
 
02:28:46.250 --> 02:28:46.260 align:start position:0%
and I will say in my time in the
 
02:28:48.230 --> 02:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
department this has been the biggest
 
02:28:50.389 --> 02:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
issue relative to payroll cards
 
02:28:52.429 --> 02:28:52.439 align:start position:0%
certainly we've heard about unbanked
 
02:28:54.830 --> 02:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
individuals and fees passed on to folks
 
02:28:57.050 --> 02:28:57.060 align:start position:0%
but the biggest issue that the
 
02:28:59.210 --> 02:28:59.220 align:start position:0%
department has seen relative to employee
 
02:29:01.070 --> 02:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
complaints and payroll cards at least in
 
02:29:02.630 --> 02:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
my tenure at the department has been
 
02:29:05.469 --> 02:29:05.479 align:start position:0%
instances in which individuals have had
 
02:29:07.670 --> 02:29:07.680 align:start position:0%
processing problems where they they're
 
02:29:10.550 --> 02:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
not trying to make a purchase or it's
 
02:29:11.990 --> 02:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
not that they're trying to make multiple
 
02:29:14.150 --> 02:29:14.160 align:start position:0%
purchases and there's fees their issue
 
02:29:16.790 --> 02:29:16.800 align:start position:0%
has been I'm not able to access it and
 
02:29:18.830 --> 02:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
where we have had some difficulties is
 
02:29:20.510 --> 02:29:20.520 align:start position:0%
that there have been employers who have
 
02:29:22.849 --> 02:29:22.859 align:start position:0%
then said deal with the card company
 
02:29:25.130 --> 02:29:25.140 align:start position:0%
don't deal with me and that's why again
 
02:29:26.990 --> 02:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
I do appreciate the inclusion of the
 
02:29:28.969 --> 02:29:28.979 align:start position:0%
fact that here it is very clearly on the
 
02:29:31.190 --> 02:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
employer that we would be looking for
 
02:29:33.349 --> 02:29:33.359 align:start position:0%
the employer to make that right in the
 
02:29:35.929 --> 02:29:35.939 align:start position:0%
immediate I I do take the point that 24
 
02:29:37.910 --> 02:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
hours on a weekend does present I
 
02:29:39.770 --> 02:29:39.780 align:start position:0%
understand your your concern that that
 
02:29:42.230 --> 02:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
could present issues as presently
 
02:29:44.150 --> 02:29:44.160 align:start position:0%
drafted we would say within 24 hours of
 
02:29:45.950 --> 02:29:45.960 align:start position:0%
being notified the employer should be
 
02:29:48.650 --> 02:29:48.660 align:start position:0%
taking action on that well
 
02:29:50.870 --> 02:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
I could I follow up on that question
 
02:29:50.880 --> 02:29:52.130 align:start position:0%
I could I follow up on that question
because

02:29:52.130 --> 02:29:52.140 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:29:52.140 --> 02:29:54.469 align:start position:0%
because
so

02:29:54.469 --> 02:29:54.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:29:57.410 --> 02:29:57.420 align:start position:0%
as I see it there could be there's many
 
02:30:00.410 --> 02:30:00.420 align:start position:0%
levels of different organizations that
 
02:30:03.230 --> 02:30:03.240 align:start position:0%
come between the employee the employer
 
02:30:05.630 --> 02:30:05.640 align:start position:0%
and the cash in hand
 
02:30:05.640 --> 02:30:06.910 align:start position:0%
and the cash in hand
and

02:30:06.910 --> 02:30:06.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:30:09.889 --> 02:30:09.899 align:start position:0%
you answered an earlier question that
 
02:30:12.050 --> 02:30:12.060 align:start position:0%
you're mostly concerned that the
 
02:30:14.349 --> 02:30:14.359 align:start position:0%
employer has made that cash available
 
02:30:17.450 --> 02:30:17.460 align:start position:0%
but the issue of the employee getting
 
02:30:21.170 --> 02:30:21.180 align:start position:0%
that cash could be the bank that has the
 
02:30:24.110 --> 02:30:24.120 align:start position:0%
Visa sticker on their window that is now
 
02:30:26.889 --> 02:30:26.899 align:start position:0%
honoring some other bank's payroll card
 
02:30:29.510 --> 02:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
which if I understood the previous
 
02:30:31.610 --> 02:30:31.620 align:start position:0%
testimony was all
 
02:30:33.770 --> 02:30:33.780 align:start position:0%
federally regulated
 
02:30:33.780 --> 02:30:35.090 align:start position:0%
federally regulated
so

02:30:35.090 --> 02:30:35.100 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:30:37.849 --> 02:30:37.859 align:start position:0%
how might the New Hampshire Department
 
02:30:40.969 --> 02:30:40.979 align:start position:0%
of Labor get involved with let's say the
 
02:30:42.349 --> 02:30:42.359 align:start position:0%
person who brings their payroll card
 
02:30:45.650 --> 02:30:45.660 align:start position:0%
into the bank the bank wanted ID that
 
02:30:48.050 --> 02:30:48.060 align:start position:0%
the person didn't have available and
 
02:30:50.750 --> 02:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
said well now I can't get my pay because
 
02:30:53.870 --> 02:30:53.880 align:start position:0%
this bank is not giving it to me at what
 
02:30:55.969 --> 02:30:55.979 align:start position:0%
point can the State Department of Labor
 
02:30:57.830 --> 02:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
get involved if the person is not able
 
02:31:00.410 --> 02:31:00.420 align:start position:0%
to access their wages without a fee we
 
02:31:02.690 --> 02:31:02.700 align:start position:0%
would say that that's a violation okay
 
02:31:06.590 --> 02:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
so and independent of at what point in
 
02:31:11.630 --> 02:31:11.640 align:start position:0%
the process that inability was generated
 
02:31:15.290 --> 02:31:15.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:17.690 --> 02:31:17.700 align:start position:0%
thank you for letting me please jump in
 
02:31:20.210 --> 02:31:20.220 align:start position:0%
and follow up thank you for the
 
02:31:20.220 --> 02:31:21.110 align:start position:0%
and follow up thank you for the
follow-up

02:31:21.110 --> 02:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:31:23.510 --> 02:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
um so we replaced the card in 24 hours
 
02:31:25.370 --> 02:31:25.380 align:start position:0%
say they they call you at you know seven
 
02:31:26.929 --> 02:31:26.939 align:start position:0%
o'clock on a Friday night we replace a
 
02:31:28.309 --> 02:31:28.319 align:start position:0%
Saturday morning that guy's not going to
 
02:31:30.050 --> 02:31:30.060 align:start position:0%
be live till Monday morning
 
02:31:31.670 --> 02:31:31.680 align:start position:0%
how is that replacing how is that going
 
02:31:33.230 --> 02:31:33.240 align:start position:0%
to be able to replace those wages since
 
02:31:35.450 --> 02:31:35.460 align:start position:0%
the Banking Company all the payroll
 
02:31:36.770 --> 02:31:36.780 align:start position:0%
companies will be closed until that time
 
02:31:38.750 --> 02:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
on Monday morning
 
02:31:41.270 --> 02:31:41.280 align:start position:0%
I I imagine there are pot that that
 
02:31:42.770 --> 02:31:42.780 align:start position:0%
might be a scenario in which there'd be
 
02:31:44.510 --> 02:31:44.520 align:start position:0%
issue there could be other scenarios in
 
02:31:46.309 --> 02:31:46.319 align:start position:0%
which that language might be deemed
 
02:31:48.650 --> 02:31:48.660 align:start position:0%
problematic again I believe the intent
 
02:31:50.210 --> 02:31:50.220 align:start position:0%
of that language is to just highlight
 
02:31:52.010 --> 02:31:52.020 align:start position:0%
the fact that when there is an issue the
 
02:31:53.510 --> 02:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
employer is being looked at to correct
 
02:31:56.090 --> 02:31:56.100 align:start position:0%
it in the immediate uh to your point yes
 
02:31:58.730 --> 02:31:58.740 align:start position:0%
if it's not ultimately Avail if the card
 
02:32:00.650 --> 02:32:00.660 align:start position:0%
the language says that they'll be
 
02:32:02.870 --> 02:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
provided a replacement card within 24
 
02:32:07.429 --> 02:32:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:10.190 --> 02:32:10.200 align:start position:0%
okay and you've noticed something I'll
 
02:32:12.290 --> 02:32:12.300 align:start position:0%
be back representative Cahill
 
02:32:14.630 --> 02:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr
 
02:32:18.170 --> 02:32:18.180 align:start position:0%
Ogden I want to sort of piggyback on uh
 
02:32:20.450 --> 02:32:20.460 align:start position:0%
representative colcom's question
 
02:32:23.389 --> 02:32:23.399 align:start position:0%
uh with do you have a record I know you
 
02:32:25.070 --> 02:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
said anecdotally that you know what you
 
02:32:26.630 --> 02:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
saw what you're most familiar with is
 
02:32:28.490 --> 02:32:28.500 align:start position:0%
what they they can't get the the money
 
02:32:31.610 --> 02:32:31.620 align:start position:0%
do you have any any sort of record of
 
02:32:34.010 --> 02:32:34.020 align:start position:0%
other infractions on how many and how
 
02:32:35.870 --> 02:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
well how frequently they happen people
 
02:32:38.929 --> 02:32:38.939 align:start position:0%
having trouble with these cards
 
02:32:40.730 --> 02:32:40.740 align:start position:0%
I can look to see what we have
 
02:32:43.309 --> 02:32:43.319 align:start position:0%
specifically I don't have that at hand I
 
02:32:45.770 --> 02:32:45.780 align:start position:0%
would say that it's not a frequent issue
 
02:32:48.290 --> 02:32:48.300 align:start position:0%
and again most often when it comes up it
 
02:32:50.270 --> 02:32:50.280 align:start position:0%
is individuals who are not able to
 
02:32:52.969 --> 02:32:52.979 align:start position:0%
access it so our folks on intake will
 
02:32:55.370 --> 02:32:55.380 align:start position:0%
get a call they're being told hey I have
 
02:32:58.070 --> 02:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
this card I can't access it you know no
 
02:32:59.389 --> 02:32:59.399 align:start position:0%
one's helping me
 
02:33:01.790 --> 02:33:01.800 align:start position:0%
um and and we we work through that again
 
02:33:03.830 --> 02:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
it's not frequent I can see what data
 
02:33:05.630 --> 02:33:05.640 align:start position:0%
they have relative to the number of
 
02:33:07.130 --> 02:33:07.140 align:start position:0%
those calls
 
02:33:09.349 --> 02:33:09.359 align:start position:0%
um but again that is the issue that most
 
02:33:12.170 --> 02:33:12.180 align:start position:0%
often comes up uh in terms of a a
 
02:33:14.690 --> 02:33:14.700 align:start position:0%
complaint to the department thank you a
 
02:33:14.700 --> 02:33:15.790 align:start position:0%
complaint to the department thank you a
follow-up

02:33:15.790 --> 02:33:15.800 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:33:18.710 --> 02:33:18.720 align:start position:0%
and thank you for that and again if this
 
02:33:21.170 --> 02:33:21.180 align:start position:0%
should pass then the willingness to
 
02:33:23.990 --> 02:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
accept the payroll card becomes a
 
02:33:26.330 --> 02:33:26.340 align:start position:0%
condition of employment is that your
 
02:33:26.340 --> 02:33:29.090 align:start position:0%
condition of employment is that your
understanding

02:33:29.090 --> 02:33:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:31.250 --> 02:33:31.260 align:start position:0%
um yes they would have to offer direct
 
02:33:33.830 --> 02:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
deposit first if the individual doesn't
 
02:33:36.170 --> 02:33:36.180 align:start position:0%
have a bank account or does not provide
 
02:33:37.910 --> 02:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
their bank account information it would
 
02:33:40.610 --> 02:33:40.620 align:start position:0%
then go to a payroll card and and to
 
02:33:42.349 --> 02:33:42.359 align:start position:0%
your point that would be yes you want to
 
02:33:44.630 --> 02:33:44.640 align:start position:0%
work here and be paid you're on one of
 
02:33:46.130 --> 02:33:46.140 align:start position:0%
those platforms
 
02:33:48.410 --> 02:33:48.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:33:50.630 --> 02:33:50.640 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie thank you
 
02:33:55.309 --> 02:33:55.319 align:start position:0%
uh if I uh as an employer uh send out a
 
02:33:57.170 --> 02:33:57.180 align:start position:0%
check and the check is bad
 
02:33:59.090 --> 02:33:59.100 align:start position:0%
there's some legal
 
02:34:01.670 --> 02:34:01.680 align:start position:0%
uh recalls employees have it's against
 
02:34:04.550 --> 02:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
the law you can't do that is this the
 
02:34:07.250 --> 02:34:07.260 align:start position:0%
same environment that we that this these
 
02:34:09.530 --> 02:34:09.540 align:start position:0%
cods exist in if the employer does not
 
02:34:11.750 --> 02:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
deposit the money on Thursday afternoon
 
02:34:14.270 --> 02:34:14.280 align:start position:0%
so the employee can access it are they
 
02:34:16.730 --> 02:34:16.740 align:start position:0%
under any kind of liability if the card
 
02:34:18.469 --> 02:34:18.479 align:start position:0%
comes up short
 
02:34:20.270 --> 02:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
if the money's not in the account as
 
02:34:22.429 --> 02:34:22.439 align:start position:0%
opposed to giving somebody a check I
 
02:34:24.349 --> 02:34:24.359 align:start position:0%
can't speak specifically to criminal
 
02:34:26.030 --> 02:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
liability that they may face or other
 
02:34:27.889 --> 02:34:27.899 align:start position:0%
types of liability they would be have
 
02:34:29.809 --> 02:34:29.819 align:start position:0%
liability with the Department in terms
 
02:34:31.910 --> 02:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
of we would look that at that as if
 
02:34:34.190 --> 02:34:34.200 align:start position:0%
they're not processing payment promptly
 
02:34:36.830 --> 02:34:36.840 align:start position:0%
or in full that would be a violation and
 
02:34:38.570 --> 02:34:38.580 align:start position:0%
we would say those monies are owed and
 
02:34:40.250 --> 02:34:40.260 align:start position:0%
there could be civil penalties through
 
02:34:42.590 --> 02:34:42.600 align:start position:0%
the department I I'll I don't know if
 
02:34:44.030 --> 02:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
there's other violations for
 
02:34:48.170 --> 02:34:48.180 align:start position:0%
underfunding uh payroll uh payroll cards
 
02:34:49.969 --> 02:34:49.979 align:start position:0%
and I would say that it would we would
 
02:34:51.950 --> 02:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
view checks the same as when people pay
 
02:34:54.410 --> 02:34:54.420 align:start position:0%
via check if there's a if it can't be
 
02:34:56.330 --> 02:34:56.340 align:start position:0%
cashed again we don't take criminal
 
02:34:58.190 --> 02:34:58.200 align:start position:0%
action we would view that as a violation
 
02:35:00.830 --> 02:35:00.840 align:start position:0%
of labor law for not paying in full
 
02:35:02.389 --> 02:35:02.399 align:start position:0%
um and there be liability for that
 
02:35:04.790 --> 02:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
through us again I can't we don't handle
 
02:35:08.809 --> 02:35:08.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:10.370 --> 02:35:10.380 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:35:12.710 --> 02:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
are there other questions representative
 
02:35:15.170 --> 02:35:15.180 align:start position:0%
avaloni thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
02:35:19.429 --> 02:35:19.439 align:start position:0%
you again uh commissioner Artin um
 
02:35:21.830 --> 02:35:21.840 align:start position:0%
on the employer side
 
02:35:21.840 --> 02:35:27.349 align:start position:0%
on the employer side
um

02:35:27.349 --> 02:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:29.090 --> 02:35:29.100 align:start position:0%
if the employer does not offer a payroll
 
02:35:30.410 --> 02:35:30.420 align:start position:0%
account let's say they're using a
 
02:35:32.630 --> 02:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
mom-and-pop only issues only has the
 
02:35:35.090 --> 02:35:35.100 align:start position:0%
three money check or electronic transfer
 
02:35:37.250 --> 02:35:37.260 align:start position:0%
are they mandated now under this to
 
02:35:38.690 --> 02:35:38.700 align:start position:0%
provide a payroll card if somebody
 
02:35:42.170 --> 02:35:42.180 align:start position:0%
declines all those three options no
 
02:35:44.570 --> 02:35:44.580 align:start position:0%
my reading of this doesn't change the
 
02:35:46.429 --> 02:35:46.439 align:start position:0%
fact that the employer would still have
 
02:35:48.889 --> 02:35:48.899 align:start position:0%
the option to say I want to pay via cash
 
02:35:53.030 --> 02:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
or or check
 
02:35:55.630 --> 02:35:55.640 align:start position:0%
so once and uh follow-up
 
02:35:58.490 --> 02:35:58.500 align:start position:0%
uh so on page two
 
02:36:02.990 --> 02:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
um section two paragraph B
 
02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:04.490 align:start position:0%
um section two paragraph B
um

02:36:04.490 --> 02:36:04.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:06.710 --> 02:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
I'd like to know how an employer could
 
02:36:09.050 --> 02:36:09.060 align:start position:0%
initiate payments of wages if they
 
02:36:12.349 --> 02:36:12.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:14.450 --> 02:36:14.460 align:start position:0%
and then this is my reading of it what I
 
02:36:16.370 --> 02:36:16.380 align:start position:0%
would do is looking at paragraph B
 
02:36:19.429 --> 02:36:19.439 align:start position:0%
paragraph B is part of uh
 
02:36:23.090 --> 02:36:23.100 align:start position:0%
section two so section two starts by
 
02:36:24.950 --> 02:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
saying if an employer offers its
 
02:36:27.590 --> 02:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
employees the option of receiving by a
 
02:36:29.990 --> 02:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
payroll card the employer shall and then
 
02:36:32.330 --> 02:36:32.340 align:start position:0%
it goes through but I think all of that
 
02:36:34.070 --> 02:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
is first flowing from the fact that the
 
02:36:35.990 --> 02:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
employer has elected to offer it via
 
02:36:37.670 --> 02:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
payroll card I don't view that as
 
02:36:39.889 --> 02:36:39.899 align:start position:0%
necessarily controlling or altering the
 
02:36:41.570 --> 02:36:41.580 align:start position:0%
above which is if you go back to
 
02:36:44.389 --> 02:36:44.399 align:start position:0%
paragraph one on page one
 
02:36:48.050 --> 02:36:48.060 align:start position:0%
um in a b and c it it introduces those
 
02:36:49.969 --> 02:36:49.979 align:start position:0%
other methods or modes of payment so
 
02:36:51.770 --> 02:36:51.780 align:start position:0%
again that's my reading of it if someone
 
02:36:53.870 --> 02:36:53.880 align:start position:0%
disagrees with the Department's reading
 
02:36:55.429 --> 02:36:55.439 align:start position:0%
we're happy to hear that but the
 
02:36:58.130 --> 02:36:58.140 align:start position:0%
Department's reading of this language as
 
02:37:01.070 --> 02:37:01.080 align:start position:0%
submitted is that those options still
 
02:37:04.070 --> 02:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
exist really what this is doing is uh
 
02:37:06.190 --> 02:37:06.200 align:start position:0%
taking away the option of the employee
 
02:37:09.050 --> 02:37:09.060 align:start position:0%
saying that they want to be paid via a
 
02:37:11.090 --> 02:37:11.100 align:start position:0%
check or paper check
 
02:37:12.830 --> 02:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
so similar I think representative
 
02:37:14.750 --> 02:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
seaworth had spoken to that that again I
 
02:37:17.450 --> 02:37:17.460 align:start position:0%
think that's the change here is it
 
02:37:19.190 --> 02:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
saying that they can no longer request a
 
02:37:22.070 --> 02:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
paper check I do not read this as saying
 
02:37:25.190 --> 02:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
the employer cannot elect to provide a
 
02:37:28.490 --> 02:37:28.500 align:start position:0%
paper check or pay via cash on their own
 
02:37:29.929 --> 02:37:29.939 align:start position:0%
thank you and that leads me to my final
 
02:37:29.939 --> 02:37:31.309 align:start position:0%
thank you and that leads me to my final
question

02:37:31.309 --> 02:37:31.319 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:37:33.650 --> 02:37:33.660 align:start position:0%
same paragraph for uh
 
02:37:36.290 --> 02:37:36.300 align:start position:0%
if an employee only offers
 
02:37:38.210 --> 02:37:38.220 align:start position:0%
electronic payments and they don't
 
02:37:39.550 --> 02:37:39.560 align:start position:0%
provide their
 
02:37:41.690 --> 02:37:41.700 align:start position:0%
employee doesn't provide their bank
 
02:37:43.790 --> 02:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
account information I'd like to know how
 
02:37:45.770 --> 02:37:45.780 align:start position:0%
the employer is supposed to deposit that
 
02:37:45.780 --> 02:37:47.410 align:start position:0%
the employer is supposed to deposit that
money

02:37:47.410 --> 02:37:47.420 align:start position:0%
money
 
02:37:50.150 --> 02:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
so again the way if you're in paragraph
 
02:37:53.870 --> 02:37:53.880 align:start position:0%
B correct so again going up to two it's
 
02:37:57.230 --> 02:37:57.240 align:start position:0%
saying that if they offer uh if if they
 
02:37:59.389 --> 02:37:59.399 align:start position:0%
do it by payroll card
 
02:38:01.550 --> 02:38:01.560 align:start position:0%
they're going to provide the disclosure
 
02:38:03.410 --> 02:38:03.420 align:start position:0%
and a saying you have to give them all
 
02:38:05.690 --> 02:38:05.700 align:start position:0%
the disclosures B is saying they can
 
02:38:08.990 --> 02:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
initiate that but it but it adds in
 
02:38:12.230 --> 02:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
there that it's after they have failed
 
02:38:14.330 --> 02:38:14.340 align:start position:0%
to provide so the employee has the
 
02:38:16.849 --> 02:38:16.859 align:start position:0%
option of saying listen I wanna I want
 
02:38:19.790 --> 02:38:19.800 align:start position:0%
you to do direct deposit here is my bank
 
02:38:22.070 --> 02:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
account information if the employee
 
02:38:24.950 --> 02:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't do that that's a condition to
 
02:38:26.990 --> 02:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
then saying okay now they can do the the
 
02:38:29.450 --> 02:38:29.460 align:start position:0%
payroll card could be forced does that
 
02:38:30.950 --> 02:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
make sense I apologize I'm not answering
 
02:38:32.690 --> 02:38:32.700 align:start position:0%
your question but again I'm seeing b as
 
02:38:32.700 --> 02:38:34.610 align:start position:0%
your question but again I'm seeing b as
saying

02:38:34.610 --> 02:38:34.620 align:start position:0%
saying
 
02:38:37.309 --> 02:38:37.319 align:start position:0%
paying via payroll card one of the
 
02:38:39.590 --> 02:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
conditions of forcing the payroll card
 
02:38:41.809 --> 02:38:41.819 align:start position:0%
is first giving them the option to elect
 
02:38:44.030 --> 02:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
direct deposit if they fail to elect
 
02:38:45.590 --> 02:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
direct deposit
 
02:38:47.630 --> 02:38:47.640 align:start position:0%
or if they fail to provide the bank
 
02:38:49.309 --> 02:38:49.319 align:start position:0%
information so the employer can affect
 
02:38:51.469 --> 02:38:51.479 align:start position:0%
direct deposit then you could do the
 
02:38:56.929 --> 02:38:56.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:56.939 --> 02:38:57.950 align:start position:0%
 
final

02:38:57.950 --> 02:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
final
 
02:39:02.210 --> 02:39:02.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:05.030 --> 02:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
um so as I read it it looks like the if
 
02:39:07.070 --> 02:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
the the if the employee just has
 
02:39:09.770 --> 02:39:09.780 align:start position:0%
electronic means to deposit whether to
 
02:39:11.870 --> 02:39:11.880 align:start position:0%
use a small company
 
02:39:11.880 --> 02:39:13.010 align:start position:0%
use a small company
um

02:39:13.010 --> 02:39:13.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:14.570 --> 02:39:14.580 align:start position:0%
that they're being forced if the
 
02:39:16.250 --> 02:39:16.260 align:start position:0%
employee could game the system and say
 
02:39:17.330 --> 02:39:17.340 align:start position:0%
okay well I'm not going to give you my
 
02:39:18.469 --> 02:39:18.479 align:start position:0%
bank account information I'm going to
 
02:39:20.450 --> 02:39:20.460 align:start position:0%
make you get payroll cards
 
02:39:22.490 --> 02:39:22.500 align:start position:0%
because I'm not giving you the option I
 
02:39:24.050 --> 02:39:24.060 align:start position:0%
don't want to check I don't want cash
 
02:39:26.450 --> 02:39:26.460 align:start position:0%
they're denying all these so the
 
02:39:28.550 --> 02:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
employer has we're going to give you
 
02:39:31.070 --> 02:39:31.080 align:start position:0%
electronic means for your deposit we're
 
02:39:32.150 --> 02:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
not you can't get the bank account
 
02:39:34.130 --> 02:39:34.140 align:start position:0%
information now they're forcing me as an
 
02:39:36.590 --> 02:39:36.600 align:start position:0%
employer to offer to force them to have
 
02:39:38.929 --> 02:39:38.939 align:start position:0%
a Banky card
 
02:39:40.969 --> 02:39:40.979 align:start position:0%
even though my say my payroll company
 
02:39:43.070 --> 02:39:43.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't offer them
 
02:39:45.349 --> 02:39:45.359 align:start position:0%
I'll admit my first in going through
 
02:39:47.150 --> 02:39:47.160 align:start position:0%
this I I didn't necessarily take it that
 
02:39:48.710 --> 02:39:48.720 align:start position:0%
way I would say that to the extent
 
02:39:50.450 --> 02:39:50.460 align:start position:0%
you're concerned about that and others
 
02:39:51.710 --> 02:39:51.720 align:start position:0%
are concerned about that perhaps
 
02:39:53.330 --> 02:39:53.340 align:start position:0%
clarification on that point would would
 
02:39:55.790 --> 02:39:55.800 align:start position:0%
be needed again the Department's reading
 
02:39:57.770 --> 02:39:57.780 align:start position:0%
of this is not necessarily saying that
 
02:39:57.780 --> 02:39:59.030 align:start position:0%
of this is not necessarily saying that
that's

02:39:59.030 --> 02:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:40:01.429 --> 02:40:01.439 align:start position:0%
um that it could be forced in that way
 
02:40:04.130 --> 02:40:04.140 align:start position:0%
um but if if there's a lack of clarity
 
02:40:06.710 --> 02:40:06.720 align:start position:0%
there then perhaps adjustment should be
 
02:40:09.590 --> 02:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
made thank you thank you and I'd also
 
02:40:11.389 --> 02:40:11.399 align:start position:0%
like to follow up on that as I read it
 
02:40:14.030 --> 02:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
and I like your opinion well we have you
 
02:40:16.490 --> 02:40:16.500 align:start position:0%
here so this
 
02:40:18.889 --> 02:40:18.899 align:start position:0%
one thing that and I don't know if it
 
02:40:21.950 --> 02:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
happens often is where the employer and
 
02:40:24.230 --> 02:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
the employee do not agree on an
 
02:40:26.030 --> 02:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
acceptable form of payment
 
02:40:29.150 --> 02:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
this change in law seems to take away
 
02:40:29.160 --> 02:40:30.410 align:start position:0%
this change in law seems to take away
that

02:40:30.410 --> 02:40:30.420 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:40:32.630 --> 02:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
right now the department can say well
 
02:40:34.250 --> 02:40:34.260 align:start position:0%
you know what if you can't agree on
 
02:40:37.610 --> 02:40:37.620 align:start position:0%
anything else you have to issue a check
 
02:40:39.950 --> 02:40:39.960 align:start position:0%
this would seem to take away that
 
02:40:42.349 --> 02:40:42.359 align:start position:0%
default position
 
02:40:44.210 --> 02:40:44.220 align:start position:0%
um and that wouldn't just apply in terms
 
02:40:46.309 --> 02:40:46.319 align:start position:0%
of payroll cards it could be an employer
 
02:40:49.969 --> 02:40:49.979 align:start position:0%
says well we only pay cash there's no
 
02:40:52.910 --> 02:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
Bank transfers no checks you can you can
 
02:40:55.730 --> 02:40:55.740 align:start position:0%
only take cash right now an employee
 
02:40:58.010 --> 02:40:58.020 align:start position:0%
could say that doesn't work for me but
 
02:41:00.230 --> 02:41:00.240 align:start position:0%
this would seem to take that away and
 
02:41:02.690 --> 02:41:02.700 align:start position:0%
leave it at by my reading it's the
 
02:41:06.050 --> 02:41:06.060 align:start position:0%
employer who has the last word can say
 
02:41:09.050 --> 02:41:09.060 align:start position:0%
well this is what we offer you choose
 
02:41:09.060 --> 02:41:10.610 align:start position:0%
well this is what we offer you choose
from

02:41:10.610 --> 02:41:10.620 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:41:14.270 --> 02:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
uh what what we offer you that are valid
 
02:41:16.250 --> 02:41:16.260 align:start position:0%
uh payments
 
02:41:18.290 --> 02:41:18.300 align:start position:0%
and that's it you can't ask for
 
02:41:20.710 --> 02:41:20.720 align:start position:0%
something that we don't want to give you
 
02:41:23.990 --> 02:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
yes that is how we took the language as
 
02:41:26.090 --> 02:41:26.100 align:start position:0%
offered as well again to the extent that
 
02:41:28.610 --> 02:41:28.620 align:start position:0%
folks are saying it's that's not clear
 
02:41:31.490 --> 02:41:31.500 align:start position:0%
um we perhaps clarification on that
 
02:41:33.590 --> 02:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
point would be needed
 
02:41:36.290 --> 02:41:36.300 align:start position:0%
thank you for your input
 
02:41:39.530 --> 02:41:39.540 align:start position:0%
I see another question
 
02:41:41.809 --> 02:41:41.819 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:41:44.030 --> 02:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
so in the case of uh
 
02:41:46.610 --> 02:41:46.620 align:start position:0%
in the case of day workers well you
 
02:41:48.170 --> 02:41:48.180 align:start position:0%
would have somebody that might work for
 
02:41:50.150 --> 02:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
a landscape company one day that might
 
02:41:52.270 --> 02:41:52.280 align:start position:0%
be banging Nails another day
 
02:41:57.230 --> 02:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
they can't demand cash now under this
 
02:41:59.389 --> 02:41:59.399 align:start position:0%
they have to the employer is the
 
02:42:01.610 --> 02:42:01.620 align:start position:0%
employer tell them I'll give it to you
 
02:42:04.030 --> 02:42:04.040 align:start position:0%
in the debit card
 
02:42:07.190 --> 02:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
under this this change yes I think the
 
02:42:08.690 --> 02:42:08.700 align:start position:0%
employer would have the ability to
 
02:42:10.969 --> 02:42:10.979 align:start position:0%
direct the method of payment in that way
 
02:42:12.590 --> 02:42:12.600 align:start position:0%
so in the course of the week if I work
 
02:42:14.510 --> 02:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
for four different people
 
02:42:17.330 --> 02:42:17.340 align:start position:0%
you know work for contractor a b or c a
 
02:42:19.969 --> 02:42:19.979 align:start position:0%
d i could have a handful of of debit
 
02:42:21.950 --> 02:42:21.960 align:start position:0%
cards at the end of the week potentially
 
02:42:24.710 --> 02:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:27.469 --> 02:42:27.479 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
02:42:30.050 --> 02:42:30.060 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for getting in the
 
02:42:31.910 --> 02:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
hot seat with us
 
02:42:34.250 --> 02:42:34.260 align:start position:0%
um that was the final card I had if
 
02:42:37.010 --> 02:42:37.020 align:start position:0%
there are no other cards
 
02:42:39.830 --> 02:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
I would take the last
 
02:42:42.349 --> 02:42:42.359 align:start position:0%
blue sheet
 
02:42:45.110 --> 02:42:45.120 align:start position:0%
um and while we're getting that the the
 
02:42:48.230 --> 02:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
sign-ons we had five signed on in
 
02:42:54.469 --> 02:42:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:58.969 --> 02:42:58.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:01.370 --> 02:43:01.380 align:start position:0%
however you want to work with that hey I
 
02:43:03.250 --> 02:43:03.260 align:start position:0%
can start out the numbers you said
 
02:43:06.950 --> 02:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh five support one opposition and once
 
02:43:10.070 --> 02:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
again nobody signed in on the paper
 
02:43:13.010 --> 02:43:13.020 align:start position:0%
so with that I will close the hearing on
 
02:43:18.230 --> 02:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
SB 46 that is our business for today
 
02:43:21.469 --> 02:43:21.479 align:start position:0%
um in talking with with the chairman I
 
02:43:24.950 --> 02:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
don't think we have uh
 
02:43:26.389 --> 02:43:26.399 align:start position:0%
I don't think we're looking for
 
02:43:28.969 --> 02:43:28.979 align:start position:0%
subcommittees or a lot of detailed work
 
02:43:30.830 --> 02:43:30.840 align:start position:0%
on this but certainly
 
02:43:33.230 --> 02:43:33.240 align:start position:0%
everyone has the opportunity to think
 
02:43:35.690 --> 02:43:35.700 align:start position:0%
about what we did today reread the bills
 
02:43:38.270 --> 02:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
and and contact the chairman if you have
 
02:43:40.070 --> 02:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
specific issues
 
02:43:44.090 --> 02:43:44.100 align:start position:0%
I would expect to hear shortly a
 
02:43:46.730 --> 02:43:46.740 align:start position:0%
schedule for the executive session I
 
02:43:49.190 --> 02:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
know he also would like to get a start
 
02:43:53.330 --> 02:43:53.340 align:start position:0%
on some of our interim study work so if
 
02:43:55.550 --> 02:43:55.560 align:start position:0%
we're here for the morning for executive
 
02:43:58.010 --> 02:43:58.020 align:start position:0%
session then maybe we can have some
 
02:44:00.590 --> 02:44:00.600 align:start position:0%
subcommitting meetings after that we do
 
02:44:03.590 --> 02:44:03.600 align:start position:0%
need specific authorization from the
 
02:44:07.610 --> 02:44:07.620 align:start position:0%
speaker to do that ahead of the
 
02:44:09.530 --> 02:44:09.540 align:start position:0%
um actually getting through all the
 
02:44:14.090 --> 02:44:14.100 align:start position:0%
Senate bills so that will be TBD as well
 
02:44:18.170 --> 02:44:18.180 align:start position:0%
if there is anything else that we need
 
02:44:19.849 --> 02:44:19.859 align:start position:0%
to discuss
 
02:44:22.610 --> 02:44:22.620 align:start position:0%
I don't see any so we are adjourned for
 
02:44:24.170 --> 02:44:24.180 align:start position:0%
the day thank you very much for your
 
02:44:37.809 --> 02:44:37.819 align:start position:0%
