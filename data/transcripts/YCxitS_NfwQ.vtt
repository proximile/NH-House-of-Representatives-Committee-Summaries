morning to all the committee members
 
00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
i'm here this morning to introduce hb

i'm here this morning to introduce hb
1316.

00:07:02.309 --> 00:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
1316.
 
00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
that established that asked new
 
00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:06.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire to establish safety
 
00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
requirements for e-foil
 
00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:11.919 align:start position:0%
and electric hydrofoil surfboard
 
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
watercraft which are probably the same
 
00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
thing but
 
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
my attention was drawn to this method of
 
00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.070 align:start position:0%
my attention was drawn to this method of
propulsion

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:20.080 align:start position:0%
propulsion
 
00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
last summer when an apparition went by
 
00:07:24.629 --> 00:07:24.639 align:start position:0%
my front window
 
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
an apparently airborne human
 
00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
traveling as fast as a motorboat while
 
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
standing on a small board two or three
 
00:07:35.189 --> 00:07:35.199 align:start position:0%
feet above the water
 
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
this caught my attention
 
00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
conversations with our local police
 
00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:42.880 align:start position:0%
chief and with captain dunn levy
 
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
provided some background on this rapidly
 
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
emerging water sport and hours on the
 
00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
internet furthered my education
 
00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
and e-foil as you have the diagram in
 
00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:56.720 align:start position:0%
front of you
 
00:07:59.110 --> 00:07:59.120 align:start position:0%
consists of anywhere from a four foot
 
00:08:02.469 --> 00:08:02.479 align:start position:0%
four inch to six foot two inch board
 
00:08:05.909 --> 00:08:05.919 align:start position:0%
attached to a three foot mast picture an
 
00:08:08.309 --> 00:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
upside down sailboat
 
00:08:10.629 --> 00:08:10.639 align:start position:0%
at the bottom of which is a propeller
 
00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:13.800 align:start position:0%
and a hydrofoil it is powered by a
 
00:08:15.909 --> 00:08:15.919 align:start position:0%
lithium-ion battery
 
00:08:18.869 --> 00:08:18.879 align:start position:0%
and controlled by a hand-held bluetooth
 
00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:21.680 align:start position:0%
throttle that turns power off if the
 
00:08:23.589 --> 00:08:23.599 align:start position:0%
throttle hits the water
 
00:08:27.589 --> 00:08:27.599 align:start position:0%
or the border exceeds a 45 degree tilt
 
00:08:30.469 --> 00:08:30.479 align:start position:0%
the e-foil rises out of the water by
 
00:08:33.029 --> 00:08:33.039 align:start position:0%
delicate adjustments to the balance of
 
00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
the rider
 
00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:36.800 align:start position:0%
and e-foil can travel
 
00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:41.360 align:start position:0%
25 to 30 miles an hour its battery lasts
 
00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
from 90 to 120 minutes
 
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:49.200 align:start position:0%
it is quiet and it makes no wake
 
00:08:51.829 --> 00:08:51.839 align:start position:0%
efoils were developed about six years
 
00:08:55.829 --> 00:08:55.839 align:start position:0%
ago in puerto rico and australia
 
00:08:58.389 --> 00:08:58.399 align:start position:0%
as of september 2020
 
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:00.640 align:start position:0%
according to a new york times article
 
00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
there were about 300 dealers worldwide
 
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
that number has undoubtedly increased
 
00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:08.720 align:start position:0%
since then

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
there are several e-foil blogs that

e-foil as a boat
 
00:10:28.389 --> 00:10:28.399 align:start position:0%
and as you know boats with motors are

required to follow many regulations
 
00:10:34.069 --> 00:10:34.079 align:start position:0%

i am sure captain dunleavy can think of
 
00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
other issues
 
00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
to examine such as can two riders occupy
 
00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
one board or can an e-foil be used for
 
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:09.750 align:start position:0%
one board or can an e-foil be used for
towing

00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:09.760 align:start position:0%

e-foiling as described by advocates
 
00:12:22.389 --> 00:12:22.399 align:start position:0%
is of course
 
00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
the best thing to hit the deck since

dare i say it wake boats

i believe we failed to appreciate the

00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
too many new hampshire residents had
 
00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
bought a wake boat with a mortgage as
 
00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:56.720 align:start position:0%
you remember on our field trip
 
00:12:59.269 --> 00:12:59.279 align:start position:0%
comparable to a home mortgage
 
00:13:01.269 --> 00:13:01.279 align:start position:0%
help new hampshire stay ahead of the
 
00:13:01.279 --> 00:13:02.150 align:start position:0%
help new hampshire stay ahead of the
game

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
game
 
00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
by looking now into the role efoils
 
00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions by
 
00:13:18.069 --> 00:13:18.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
representative gould and representative
 
00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:26.069 align:start position:0%
representative gould and representative
smith

00:13:26.069 --> 00:13:26.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
whatever your question is uh
 
00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:29.509 align:start position:0%
whatever your question is uh
well

00:13:29.509 --> 00:13:29.519 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:13:32.389 --> 00:13:32.399 align:start position:0%
i'll answer if i can okay uh one of them
 
00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
is how slow can it go
 
00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
how what how slow
 
00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:37.590 align:start position:0%
how what how slow
oh

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
you mean and still maintain headway
 
00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:41.030 align:start position:0%
you mean and still maintain headway
speed

00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
speed
 
00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:42.310 align:start position:0%
speed
uh

00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:44.949 align:start position:0%
uh
probably

00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:44.959 align:start position:0%
probably
 
00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
you know i honestly i don't know that
 
00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
okay but you have to get a certain
 
00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
amount of speed too
 
00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
you know what
 
00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
when you start off on on it you're lying
 
00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
on your stomach
 
00:13:59.910 --> 00:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
and you can make it go as fast as you
 
00:14:03.829 --> 00:14:03.839 align:start position:0%
want that way but to get up on it you
 
00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
there it's a very delicate uh
 
00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:10.720 align:start position:0%
enterprise that you don't bring the
 
00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
board way up and get flipped over
 
00:14:16.389 --> 00:14:16.399 align:start position:0%
backwards or that you don't adjust it so
 
00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
we have someone here who hasn't ridden
 
00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
one so
 
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up
 
00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
and how deep is the uh the thing that
 
00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
goes into the water
 
00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
pardon me how how deep is the thing that
 
00:14:38.389 --> 00:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
goes into the water it's a three feet
 
00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:40.720 align:start position:0%
a pattern three feet
 
00:14:43.189 --> 00:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
okay yeah so when they rise up as you
 
00:14:45.189 --> 00:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
can see in that one photo they're really
 
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
quite high
 
00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
above the water
 
00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:52.389 --> 00:14:52.399 align:start position:0%

any other questions from members of the
 
00:16:06.399 --> 00:16:08.949 align:start position:0%
any other questions from members of the
committee

00:16:08.949 --> 00:16:08.959 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
being done thank you very much thank you
 
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
you can take your seat back here just
 
00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
obviously you know the rules as far as
 
00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
yep that that's right
 
00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:18.870 align:start position:0%
yep that that's right
but

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
in the interest of
 
00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:23.590 align:start position:0%
in the interest of
safety

00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
safety
 
00:16:25.749 --> 00:16:25.759 align:start position:0%
all right if if you wish
 
00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:27.680 align:start position:0%
but you can come here especially if we
 
00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:30.160 align:start position:0%
are more crowded that if best to be up
 
00:16:31.829 --> 00:16:31.839 align:start position:0%
here simply because
 
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
of you know the covet issue
 
00:16:37.829 --> 00:16:37.839 align:start position:0%
chair calls uh representative uh

chair calls uh representative uh
duchesne

00:16:39.189 --> 00:16:39.199 align:start position:0%
duchesne
 
00:16:43.509 --> 00:16:43.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
to the committee for letting me testify
 
00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
i'm one of the co-sponsors of house bill
 
00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
1316 which uh seeks to
 
00:16:54.069 --> 00:16:54.079 align:start position:0%
create a rules-making process for what
 
00:16:56.069 --> 00:16:56.079 align:start position:0%
representative gottling aptly described
 
00:16:58.389 --> 00:16:58.399 align:start position:0%
as a delicate enterprise i really like
 
00:17:00.069 --> 00:17:00.079 align:start position:0%
that description of it but um so the
 
00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
purpose of this legislation is to
 
00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
address the increasing use of e-foil
 
00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
electric hydrofoil surfboard watercraft
 
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
on new hampshire's fresh bodies of water
 
00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
as a resident of wolfeboro and their
 
00:17:12.309 --> 00:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
state representative i've seen firsthand
 
00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
how several new technologies are
 
00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
revolutionizing personal watercraft
 
00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
boats recreational activities on our
 
00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
lakes here in the granite state this
 
00:17:20.949 --> 00:17:20.959 align:start position:0%
development is great for tourism
 
00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:22.720 align:start position:0%
throughout new hampshire and tracks many
 
00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
new seasonal vacationers and new
 
00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:26.240 align:start position:0%
homeowners however there are some
 
00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:28.240 align:start position:0%
drawbacks and stresses on our resources
 
00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:30.559 align:start position:0%
caused by what can sometimes be an
 
00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:33.440 align:start position:0%
uncontrollable increase um the increase
 
00:17:35.669 --> 00:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
in efoils and electrochiral surfboards
 
00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
has created more traffic on lake
 
00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
winnipesaukee specifically i can speak
 
00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
from uh from
 
00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:43.350 align:start position:0%
from uh from
from

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
from experience boating in the varney
 
00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
islands in the alton bay area south
 
00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
wolfeboro bay wolfeboro bay winter
 
00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:50.630 align:start position:0%
wolfeboro bay wolfeboro bay winter
harbor

00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
harbor
 
00:17:53.909 --> 00:17:53.919 align:start position:0%
by cow island 19 mile 20 mile bay and
 
00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
melvin village
 
00:17:58.950 --> 00:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
and moultonborough bay
 
00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
i would say you know these new personal
 
00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
watercraft are not people who use these
 
00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
e-foils are not necessarily trained or
 
00:18:06.789 --> 00:18:06.799 align:start position:0%
educated on boating laws or standard
 
00:18:08.789 --> 00:18:08.799 align:start position:0%
practices for navigating the lake this
 
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:10.480 align:start position:0%
means careless use of e-foils and
 
00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:12.320 align:start position:0%
electrochiral surfboards can pose a
 
00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:14.320 align:start position:0%
hazard to boaters and it's quite often
 
00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
you have folks without life vests
 
00:18:17.669 --> 00:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
without any kind of real experience
 
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
maybe they've had you know a few drinks
 
00:18:20.549 --> 00:18:20.559 align:start position:0%
because it might be younger they might
 
00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:22.480 align:start position:0%
be more you know aggressive using these
 
00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
resources and everything and they will
 
00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
you know tend to get in the way of
 
00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
regular traffic they'll tend to you know
 
00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
get close to people's shoreline um
 
00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
unusually close than what's typical for
 
00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
a kind of watercraft they'll travel 25
 
00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
to 30 miles an hour um a good analogy i
 
00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:41.440 align:start position:0%
like to use is it's like long border
 
00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
skateboarders or cyclists using the
 
00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:44.240 align:start position:0%
roads without any understanding of
 
00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
traffic safety laws right there would be
 
00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:48.160 align:start position:0%
increased accidents that's essentially
 
00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
what these kinds of uh these e-foils and
 
00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
hydrofoils that we're kind of
 
00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
introducing and imagine if none of them
 
00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
have helmets right so that's kind of
 
00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
what we have as an issue now the lake is
 
00:18:58.390 --> 00:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
different because it's not a narrow
 
00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
strip of area that everyone must share
 
00:19:01.909 --> 00:19:01.919 align:start position:0%
right roads are pretty constricted but
 
00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
it's also pretty obvious where you go on
 
00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
the road if you're a pedestrian or
 
00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:06.720 align:start position:0%
someone who's essentially not an
 
00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
automobile it's operating like a bicycle
 
00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
with the lake it's more open and you can
 
00:19:13.029 --> 00:19:13.039 align:start position:0%
travel in unlimited directions though
 
00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:14.720 align:start position:0%
right there is no restriction but that
 
00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
also means that lakes can be much more
 
00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
chaotic to traverse especially with less
 
00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
experienced boaters on busy weekends
 
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
adding e-foils and electric hydrofoil
 
00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
surfboards so this mix mainly when
 
00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
operated by less experienced users makes
 
00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
complex for even makes makes complex
 
00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
travel even more difficult especially
 
00:19:35.909 --> 00:19:35.919 align:start position:0%
for people who are renting boats that
 
00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
could be you know first-time boat users
 
00:19:39.029 --> 00:19:39.039 align:start position:0%
that's a very common thing i mean lake
 
00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
winnipesaukee is starting to see record
 
00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
number of people renting votes from out
 
00:19:44.789 --> 00:19:44.799 align:start position:0%
of state coming in state and utilizing
 
00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
our resources this is a great thing for
 
00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
my local economy but it's also somewhat
 
00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
of a risk right and put stresses on a
 
00:19:51.909 --> 00:19:51.919 align:start position:0%
number of emergency response
 
00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
in different communities like mine
 
00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
as you all know the state of new
 
00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire holds and trusts the public
 
00:19:59.029 --> 00:19:59.039 align:start position:0%
waters including all natural lakes and
 
00:20:00.789 --> 00:20:00.799 align:start position:0%
and ponds of 10 acres or more in size
 
00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
navigable rivers and tidal waters for
 
00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
the use and benefit for the people of
 
00:20:06.149 --> 00:20:06.159 align:start position:0%
states so our job as state legislators
 
00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
as trustees of this public trust is to
 
00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
responsibly regulate these resources so
 
00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:12.640 align:start position:0%
everyone can safely and effectively use
 
00:20:14.789 --> 00:20:14.799 align:start position:0%
them this legislation strikes a balance
 
00:20:16.789 --> 00:20:16.799 align:start position:0%
between over stringent regulations and
 
00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
creating some basic safety and
 
00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:20.320 align:start position:0%
standardized practices like we do for
 
00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
all personal watercraft on our fresh
 
00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
waters in the state of state of new
 
00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:24.789 align:start position:0%
waters in the state of state of new
hampshire

00:20:24.789 --> 00:20:24.799 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:20:26.549 --> 00:20:26.559 align:start position:0%
this affirmation responsibility is
 
00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
significantly important to my
 
00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
constituency of wolfeboro residents
 
00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
business owners and tourists expect to
 
00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
utilize a myriad of fun watercraft but
 
00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
want some security while using these
 
00:20:39.029 --> 00:20:39.039 align:start position:0%
watercraft right whether it's other
 
00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
watercraft they're using that aren't
 
00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
e-foils that are traversing these lakes
 
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
or the e-foils and themselves right or
 
00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
people who rent who are first-time users
 
00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
that don't really understand what the
 
00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:50.480 align:start position:0%
kind of best practices are right
 
00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
um it also drives our local economy
 
00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
which depends on tourism but you know
 
00:20:55.909 --> 00:20:55.919 align:start position:0%
there's a balance that needs to be
 
00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
struck right without that certain amount
 
00:20:58.789 --> 00:20:58.799 align:start position:0%
of safety and people coming back after
 
00:21:02.149 --> 00:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
having a good time um you know people
 
00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
won't want to come back they'll go to
 
00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
other places um so i encourage the
 
00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
community to vote ought to pass on house
 
00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
bill 1316 i was also be happy to work
 
00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
with any committee member to make
 
00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
changes to the legislation if necessary
 
00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:13.029 align:start position:0%
changes to the legislation if necessary
and

00:21:13.029 --> 00:21:13.039 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
remain open to any questions uh thank
 
00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:18.149 align:start position:0%
remain open to any questions uh thank
you

00:21:18.149 --> 00:21:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:19.669 --> 00:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
any questions by members of the
 
00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
committee representative huff
 
00:21:24.789 --> 00:21:24.799 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and uh thank you
 
00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:26.720 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:28.480 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned
 
00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
that personal watercraft on the lake you
 
00:21:32.149 --> 00:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
know like cedars i used to have a sea
 
00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
doo um
 
00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
i already have uh rules in place why not
 
00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
just apply those rules to this
 
00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
well because um part of the reason is
 
00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
what the legend to my understanding the
 
00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
legislation would allow for that process
 
00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
to happen right we need to direct the
 
00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
state police who controls marine patrol
 
00:21:51.669 --> 00:21:51.679 align:start position:0%
to direct them to make rules unless the
 
00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
legislature directs these agencies to
 
00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
make rules and they're i don't think
 
00:21:57.270 --> 00:21:57.280 align:start position:0%
they can just go off and women decide
 
00:21:58.870 --> 00:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
how to define these and to make the
 
00:22:01.029 --> 00:22:01.039 align:start position:0%
rules for them so this is just enabling
 
00:22:02.789 --> 00:22:02.799 align:start position:0%
them to do that process to work with the
 
00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
public and to create some you know
 
00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
basically some standardized best
 
00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
practices for how these are going to be
 
00:22:10.149 --> 00:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
used on a public resource great
 
00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:13.120 align:start position:0%

no the uh your
 
00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:37.840 align:start position:0%

amigo thank you mr chair for taking my
 
00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
question thank you representative i'm
 
00:22:43.669 --> 00:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
sorry i misunderstood i thought i heard
 
00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:46.240 align:start position:0%
in the original speaker that um these
 
00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
efoils were defined as boats and would
 
00:22:51.669 --> 00:22:51.679 align:start position:0%
therefore follow the same
 
00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
restrictions as boats was i
 
00:22:59.110 --> 00:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
um to my understanding um i i don't know
 
00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:04.559 align:start position:0%
where exactly they're defining the law
 
00:23:05.909 --> 00:23:05.919 align:start position:0%
but i know they're not under the same
 
00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:08.240 align:start position:0%
requirements as boats right so you don't
 
00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
have to wear a life preserver you don't
 
00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
have to have
 
00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
these kinds of um these e-foils
 
00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
registered right you don't need to get a
 
00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
perimeter a sticker or anything for the
 
00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
most part you just buy it you can just
 
00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
use it on the resource
 
00:23:24.789 --> 00:23:24.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:27.669 --> 00:23:27.679 align:start position:0%
yeah captain dunleavy can kind of um can
 
00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
kind of but to my understanding this is
 
00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
just requiring the department of state
 
00:23:34.549 --> 00:23:34.559 align:start position:0%
police to adopt some basic rules and to
 
00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
your question answered
 
00:23:47.269 --> 00:23:47.279 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you uh representative
 
00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
gould okay thank you mr chair and thank
 
00:23:51.909 --> 00:23:51.919 align:start position:0%
you representative uh just a question
 
00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
once again about the item itself uh can
 
00:23:58.950 --> 00:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:01.669 --> 00:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
yeah it could go up for the most part it
 
00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:03.440 align:start position:0%
can go anywhere where you know you can
 
00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
be able to get um probably i mean you
 
00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
would probably need at least i'd say
 
00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
that's obviously you got three you got
 
00:24:13.029 --> 00:24:13.039 align:start position:0%
three feet of the foil itself right and
 
00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
um so you need that to be able to um i'm
 
00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
trying to the draft right so you need at
 
00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
least like three to four feet of draft
 
00:24:21.029 --> 00:24:21.039 align:start position:0%
but anything with three or four feet of
 
00:24:23.269 --> 00:24:23.279 align:start position:0%
draft with probably about you know six
 
00:24:25.269 --> 00:24:25.279 align:start position:0%
feet to be able to move around and yeah
 
00:24:27.029 --> 00:24:27.039 align:start position:0%
you could probably go up a stream down a
 
00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
river um you could traverse tidal waves
 
00:24:32.149 --> 00:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
and everything out in the ocean you can
 
00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
go lake winnipesaukee you can go into
 
00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:36.400 align:start position:0%
back bay lay in your stomach and go
 
00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
under the bridge there and then go into
 
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
back bay in wolfeboro you go all over
 
00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
the place i mean basically if you've got
 
00:24:43.269 --> 00:24:43.279 align:start position:0%
four feet of water this this thing's
 
00:24:48.789 --> 00:24:48.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:52.240 align:start position:0%
any other questions and
 
00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you for having
 
00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:57.909 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you for having
me

00:24:57.909 --> 00:24:57.919 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:00.640 align:start position:0%
and now we'll
 
00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:02.720 align:start position:0%
now we'll get to the person who has all
 
00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
the answers and all the questions
 
00:25:08.149 --> 00:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
captain dunlevy the marine patrol thank
 
00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman honorable members of the
 
00:25:17.669 --> 00:25:17.679 align:start position:0%
committee my name is tim dunleavy
 
00:25:19.029 --> 00:25:19.039 align:start position:0%
captain of the marine patrol unit for
 
00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
the division of state police
 
00:25:22.789 --> 00:25:22.799 align:start position:0%
and i come before you this morning not
 
00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:24.640 align:start position:0%
only to answer any of your questions
 
00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
but to offer the support of this bill on
 
00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
behalf of the department
 
00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
i think it is important to point out
 
00:25:33.909 --> 00:25:33.919 align:start position:0%
that this statute or this this bill is
 
00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:35.360 align:start position:0%
is going to
 
00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
create the statute in statute the
 
00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
ability of the commissioner only to
 
00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
develop rulemaking for these craft
 
00:25:45.029 --> 00:25:45.039 align:start position:0%
which if you're not familiar obviously
 
00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:47.200 align:start position:0%
that that whole process involves public
 
00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
input so
 
00:25:50.549 --> 00:25:50.559 align:start position:0%
it's recognizing this craft in the
 
00:25:52.789 --> 00:25:52.799 align:start position:0%
marine environment making it eligible
 
00:25:54.549 --> 00:25:54.559 align:start position:0%
for rulemaking
 
00:25:56.950 --> 00:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
we had a temporary designation from the
 
00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
coast guard
 
00:25:59.669 --> 00:25:59.679 align:start position:0%
about a year ago
 
00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:02.240 align:start position:0%
uh acknowledging the existence of these
 
00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
uh devices they are definitely in their
 
00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:06.320 align:start position:0%
infancy in the overall scheme of the
 
00:26:07.669 --> 00:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
boating world
 
00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
uh we are anticipating uh any week now
 
00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
the official designation of these craft
 
00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:15.440 align:start position:0%
as boats uh
 
00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
at the
 
00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
level of the federal government and our
 
00:26:19.909 --> 00:26:19.919 align:start position:0%
existing rules already
 
00:26:22.549 --> 00:26:22.559 align:start position:0%
would uh recognize once it is designated
 
00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
a boat
 
00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
things like certain safety equipment
 
00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
life jacket wear
 
00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
what may come of this though is the
 
00:26:32.789 --> 00:26:32.799 align:start position:0%
requirement to wear it
 
00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:34.720 align:start position:0%
devices similar to this on the water
 
00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
like a personal watercraft
 
00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps a person on a wake board being
 
00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
towed skiers
 
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
whenever there's a separation from the
 
00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:45.110 align:start position:0%
whenever there's a separation from the
person

00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
from whatever it is they're riding
 
00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
obviously there's then a lack of
 
00:26:50.549 --> 00:26:50.559 align:start position:0%
floatation particularly if the person's
 
00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:52.240 align:start position:0%
injured so that's something that a
 
00:26:54.549 --> 00:26:54.559 align:start position:0%
legislature may want to look at is to
 
00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
whether or not a mandatory wear of life
 
00:26:58.310 --> 00:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
jackets while using this type of a
 
00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
device is appropriate that's going to be
 
00:27:03.029 --> 00:27:03.039 align:start position:0%
separate from the rule-making authority
 
00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:04.640 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about
 
00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
so i'm happy to answer any of your
 
00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:07.269 align:start position:0%
so i'm happy to answer any of your
questions

00:27:07.269 --> 00:27:07.279 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
but department of safety does offer the
 
00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:15.200 align:start position:0%
any questions represent represent
 
00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
representative post then representative
 
00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
smith you mr chair and i think you have
 
00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
yours on
 
00:27:26.549 --> 00:27:26.559 align:start position:0%
thank you um and and thank you um
 
00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
captain dunleavy for being here today so
 
00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
my question is if it's
 
00:27:34.149 --> 00:27:34.159 align:start position:0%
um going to be designated as a boat and
 
00:27:35.909 --> 00:27:35.919 align:start position:0%
i'm you're pretty sure that's going to
 
00:27:37.269 --> 00:27:37.279 align:start position:0%
happen right
 
00:27:37.279 --> 00:27:38.070 align:start position:0%
happen right
um

00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:40.480 align:start position:0%
will there be the same things where if
 
00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
someone was renting a boat
 
00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
on a lake um that you have to get a
 
00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:48.630 align:start position:0%
on a lake um that you have to get a
temporary

00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
license to do that would that be part of
 
00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:52.630 align:start position:0%
license to do that would that be part of
this

00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:27:54.149 --> 00:27:54.159 align:start position:0%
and also
 
00:27:57.510 --> 00:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
a watercraft a personal watercraft would
 
00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:58.549 align:start position:0%
a watercraft a personal watercraft would
it

00:27:58.549 --> 00:27:58.559 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
fall more under that than the personal
 
00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
watercraft so those are my two questions
 
00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:06.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for your questions first off
 
00:28:08.789 --> 00:28:08.799 align:start position:0%
once we receive the designation that it
 
00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:10.720 align:start position:0%
is considered a vessel we will have to
 
00:28:13.029 --> 00:28:13.039 align:start position:0%
do an analysis as to whether or not the
 
00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
propulsion is equivalent to a certain
 
00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:17.110 align:start position:0%
propulsion is equivalent to a certain
horsepower

00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
horsepower
 
00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:18.789 align:start position:0%
horsepower
um

00:28:18.789 --> 00:28:18.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
we then look at whether or not that
 
00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
horsepower is generated at the engine or
 
00:28:25.510 --> 00:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
in this case the machine the battery
 
00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:26.470 align:start position:0%
in this case the machine the battery
system

00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:26.480 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
or at the propeller whenever you're
 
00:28:29.909 --> 00:28:29.919 align:start position:0%
dealing with electric here you're losing
 
00:28:32.389 --> 00:28:32.399 align:start position:0%
significant horsepower by the time that
 
00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:34.640 align:start position:0%
energy gets to the propeller
 
00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
absent all those physics the current
 
00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:39.200 align:start position:0%
statute set by you folks says that
 
00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:41.200 align:start position:0%
anybody operating a vessel greater than
 
00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
25 horsepower needs that education
 
00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:45.029 align:start position:0%
25 horsepower needs that education
requirement

00:28:45.029 --> 00:28:45.039 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
00:28:46.789 --> 00:28:46.799 align:start position:0%
while this vessel will achieve certain
 
00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
speeds similar to other boats the actual
 
00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
horsepower of the craft may not initiate
 
00:28:54.149 --> 00:28:54.159 align:start position:0%
that education requirement so we're
 
00:28:55.669 --> 00:28:55.679 align:start position:0%
going to have to do that analysis once
 
00:28:58.710 --> 00:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
it's designated as a as a vessel
 
00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
as far as designating it a personal
 
00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:02.710 align:start position:0%
as far as designating it a personal
watercraft

00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:02.720 align:start position:0%
watercraft
 
00:29:05.029 --> 00:29:05.039 align:start position:0%
it it is
 
00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:06.640 align:start position:0%
somewhat outside of the existing
 
00:29:08.389 --> 00:29:08.399 align:start position:0%
definition of personal watercraft set by
 
00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
you folks
 
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
and in addition
 
00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
i would be
 
00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
cautious to folks to look at what
 
00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
currently exists in statute for
 
00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:22.720 align:start position:0%
restrictions applied to ski craft
 
00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
this is a fairly low impact
 
00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:27.669 align:start position:0%
this is a fairly low impact
craft

00:29:27.669 --> 00:29:27.679 align:start position:0%
craft
 
00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
once it's designated a boat it's going
 
00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
to need to be 150 feet away from
 
00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
shorelines and docks when it operates
 
00:29:35.269 --> 00:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
it's going to need to be at headway
 
00:29:35.279 --> 00:29:36.230 align:start position:0%
it's going to need to be at headway
speed

00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:36.240 align:start position:0%
speed
 
00:29:38.389 --> 00:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
at certain places and times which is all
 
00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
controlled by this handheld device
 
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be up and out of
 
00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
the water at headway speed the person's
 
00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:47.200 align:start position:0%
going to have to be lying on it
 
00:29:48.549 --> 00:29:48.559 align:start position:0%
and so it's going to be drawing three
 
00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
and a half four feet with a person's
 
00:29:51.269 --> 00:29:51.279 align:start position:0%
body weight so it's going to be
 
00:29:52.549 --> 00:29:52.559 align:start position:0%
restricted as to where it can go
 
00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
environmentally just due to the nature
 
00:29:56.789 --> 00:29:56.799 align:start position:0%
of the propulsion system
 
00:29:56.799 --> 00:29:57.750 align:start position:0%
of the propulsion system
so

00:29:57.750 --> 00:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:58.630 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:29:58.630 --> 00:29:58.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:01.269 --> 00:30:01.279 align:start position:0%
to engage it or or to throw it in the
 
00:30:01.279 --> 00:30:02.230 align:start position:0%
to engage it or or to throw it in the
same

00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:02.240 align:start position:0%
same
 
00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:04.480 align:start position:0%
uh category as personal watercraft or
 
00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
ski craft
 
00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
there may be some restrictions there
 
00:30:11.029 --> 00:30:11.039 align:start position:0%
that already exist that the legislature
 
00:30:13.909 --> 00:30:13.919 align:start position:0%
may no one have applied to this craft
 
00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
so it would be something to look at
 
00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
keep in mind the some of those early
 
00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
restrictions were due to noise um
 
00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
how close to shore they were
 
00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:27.440 align:start position:0%
quick movements and some of that noise
 
00:30:28.389 --> 00:30:28.399 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:30.640 align:start position:0%
this is a very quiet craft so those are
 
00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:32.320 align:start position:0%
some of the things that that you folks
 
00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
would need to look at in the future
 
00:30:37.269 --> 00:30:37.279 align:start position:0%
okay so of cut through
 
00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
oh you're fun can i do a follow-up uh
 
00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
just just i i have i would like a
 
00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:46.240 align:start position:0%
question just as a clarification so
 
00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
you are
 
00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
future statute
 
00:30:57.029 --> 00:30:57.039 align:start position:0%
statutes coming before this committee
 
00:30:58.789 --> 00:30:58.799 align:start position:0%
specific to this
 
00:30:58.799 --> 00:31:02.230 align:start position:0%
specific to this
device

00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
only to the extent that that
 
00:31:06.789 --> 00:31:06.799 align:start position:0%
the users of the lake or you folks as a
 
00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
legislature would want to further
 
00:31:10.549 --> 00:31:10.559 align:start position:0%
restrict them beyond that of a
 
00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up
 
00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:19.110 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up
okay

00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
rep representative smith for a question
 
00:31:24.149 --> 00:31:24.159 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you captain dunleavy um
 
00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
so and i'm i'm actually probably asking
 
00:31:29.669 --> 00:31:29.679 align:start position:0%
for the same clarification uh that the
 
00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:31.360 align:start position:0%
chair did which
 
00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
is you're saying with the rules that you
 
00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
would be developing under this bill
 
00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
that you would not be able to require
 
00:31:40.389 --> 00:31:40.399 align:start position:0%
the wearing of life jackets that would
 
00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:47.029 --> 00:31:47.039 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question yes the that
 
00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
is falls outside of the scope of the
 
00:31:51.029 --> 00:31:51.039 align:start position:0%
commissioner's authority for rulemaking
 
00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
on vessels
 
00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:54.640 align:start position:0%
uh so mandatory wearing of life jacket
 
00:31:57.669 --> 00:31:57.679 align:start position:0%
would need to be uh in a statute
 
00:31:57.679 --> 00:31:59.590 align:start position:0%
would need to be uh in a statute
follow-up

00:31:59.590 --> 00:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
and um one of my concerns uh with this
 
00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
and with probably any vessel on the
 
00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:06.389 align:start position:0%
and with probably any vessel on the
water

00:32:06.389 --> 00:32:06.399 align:start position:0%
water
 
00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:09.440 align:start position:0%
is uh the aquatic invasive species um
 
00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
the co-sponsored representative de shays
 
00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
talked about people using them in back
 
00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
bay and i know back bay is kind of full
 
00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:17.110 align:start position:0%
bay and i know back bay is kind of full
of

00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:20.240 align:start position:0%
milfoil and other aquatic invasives and
 
00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about something that
 
00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
goes down four feet
 
00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
we're talking about stirring up ais
 
00:32:28.789 --> 00:32:28.799 align:start position:0%
moving them around and i wondered if
 
00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
rules would be designating
 
00:32:34.389 --> 00:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
the depth of water that they could be in
 
00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
or i don't i don't know how you would do
 
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
that would be very difficult to to
 
00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
establish in rule making just because
 
00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:46.070 align:start position:0%
establish in rule making just because
um

00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
to designate a zone of a certain depth
 
00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
um is very difficult from the person at
 
00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
the surface never mind from the officer
 
00:32:57.269 --> 00:32:57.279 align:start position:0%
and from an enforcement perspective um
 
00:32:59.669 --> 00:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
but certainly i recognize your your
 
00:33:01.269 --> 00:33:01.279 align:start position:0%
concern where the depth of the
 
00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
propulsion is low in the water
 
00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:05.440 align:start position:0%
at slow speeds
 
00:33:07.909 --> 00:33:07.919 align:start position:0%
once the person
 
00:33:08.950 --> 00:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
by the way you need a lot of
 
00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
coordination and practice with this
 
00:33:12.549 --> 00:33:12.559 align:start position:0%
before you're going to be
 
00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:14.720 align:start position:0%
uh fairly comfortable on it and use it
 
00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:16.880 align:start position:0%
to its full potential which means you're
 
00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
going to be up and out of the water off
 
00:33:21.029 --> 00:33:21.039 align:start position:0%
the surface and only that propulsion
 
00:33:23.509 --> 00:33:23.519 align:start position:0%
will be below the surface which at that
 
00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
point it's quite high in the water
 
00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
but at slow speeds just starting off
 
00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:30.640 align:start position:0%
that's when that propulsion system is
 
00:33:32.149 --> 00:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
going to be amongst the weeds in shallow
 
00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
water that's true
 
00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
rulemaking would not be able to address
 
00:33:38.389 --> 00:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
that specifically for an aquatic aquatic
 
00:33:39.909 --> 00:33:39.919 align:start position:0%
invasive concern
 
00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
um because it would the only way it
 
00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
could do that is to to restrict it from
 
00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
certain areas
 
00:33:49.029 --> 00:33:49.039 align:start position:0%
uh so and that's a i've been there
 
00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:57.190 --> 00:33:57.200 align:start position:0%
any other questions from from members of
 
00:33:59.509 --> 00:33:59.519 align:start position:0%
the committee representative harp for a
 
00:33:59.519 --> 00:34:01.110 align:start position:0%
the committee representative harp for a
question

00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:02.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question captain um do you
 
00:34:07.509 --> 00:34:07.519 align:start position:0%
have any idea how many of these we have
 
00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:34:14.470 --> 00:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
one rental operation that actually gives
 
00:34:18.869 --> 00:34:18.879 align:start position:0%
lessons they're a dealer as well as a
 
00:34:18.879 --> 00:34:19.829 align:start position:0%
lessons they're a dealer as well as a
rental

00:34:19.829 --> 00:34:19.839 align:start position:0%
rental
 
00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
there are a couple of other satellite
 
00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
dealers that's really in its infancy i
 
00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
would say
 
00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
at the most we may have
 
00:34:28.389 --> 00:34:28.399 align:start position:0%
100 to 150
 
00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:34:31.589 --> 00:34:31.599 align:start position:0%
but they are about to
 
00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:38.720 align:start position:0%
and i i will say right now we are not
 
00:34:40.869 --> 00:34:40.879 align:start position:0%
receiving an overwhelming number of
 
00:34:43.109 --> 00:34:43.119 align:start position:0%
phone calls of concern
 
00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:44.720 align:start position:0%
some of the concerns are from people on
 
00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:46.240 align:start position:0%
shore saying hey where's their life
 
00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:47.430 align:start position:0%
shore saying hey where's their life
jacket

00:34:47.430 --> 00:34:47.440 align:start position:0%
jacket
 
00:34:49.829 --> 00:34:49.839 align:start position:0%
but i will i will say that the
 
00:34:51.589 --> 00:34:51.599 align:start position:0%
the operations that we have seen so far
 
00:34:53.589 --> 00:34:53.599 align:start position:0%
have been very responsible
 
00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:58.710 --> 00:34:58.720 align:start position:0%
sort of like water skiing
 
00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
wake surfing wake boarding
 
00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
it's almost as if the people who are
 
00:35:04.069 --> 00:35:04.079 align:start position:0%
using them
 
00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
already think the water is in place that
 
00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
they need to wear to life check it
 
00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
because it makes sense to so we're not
 
00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
seeing a lot of problems out there
 
00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
one or two here or there where someone
 
00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
isn't wearing a jacket but for the most
 
00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
part people think they're supposed to be
 
00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:17.680 align:start position:0%
anyway so we're not seeing a whole lot
 
00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
any other questions from members of the
 
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
committee representative post for a
 
00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
first second question
 
00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:30.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you mr
 
00:35:34.069 --> 00:35:34.079 align:start position:0%
dunleavy again um so with these wake
 
00:35:37.270 --> 00:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
boards uh do they have a similar system
 
00:35:39.829 --> 00:35:39.839 align:start position:0%
well they're not weak boards
 
00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:42.640 align:start position:0%
they're e-foils but um on unlike
 
00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
personal watercraft there's something
 
00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
you can put around your arm and that
 
00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
will pull the key out in an emergency is
 
00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
there does this just stop
 
00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question the unique
 
00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:56.240 align:start position:0%
thing with this craft is everything is
 
00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
controlled by a wrist worn device so um
 
00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:02.480 align:start position:0%
once the signal is is lost through
 
00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:03.589 align:start position:0%
once the signal is is lost through
bluetooth

00:36:03.589 --> 00:36:03.599 align:start position:0%
bluetooth
 
00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
it automatically stops and so that
 
00:36:08.790 --> 00:36:08.800 align:start position:0%
safety uh backup is there but also the
 
00:36:11.109 --> 00:36:11.119 align:start position:0%
the user is able to control it its speed
 
00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
of the the speed of the prop
 
00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:14.240 align:start position:0%
from its wrist so once there's
 
00:36:15.829 --> 00:36:15.839 align:start position:0%
separation they still have control to a
 
00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
certain distance once the signal is lost
 
00:36:21.349 --> 00:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
i will add that the ruling
 
00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
with safety equipment like tethers life
 
00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
jackets fire extinguishers whistles
 
00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
those types of things this craft is
 
00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
going to be unique and that there's not
 
00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:32.720 align:start position:0%
a lot of places to store a life jacket
 
00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
where once the designation comes that
 
00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
it's a boat and the carriage requirement
 
00:36:39.589 --> 00:36:39.599 align:start position:0%
for a jacket to be on board
 
00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:41.680 align:start position:0%
for all the users there's no place to
 
00:36:43.109 --> 00:36:43.119 align:start position:0%
put it so
 
00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
if the jacket needs to be there the only
 
00:36:47.589 --> 00:36:47.599 align:start position:0%
other place to have it is on you so
 
00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
somewhat by default i think we're going
 
00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:55.829 --> 00:36:55.839 align:start position:0%
representative huff for a question
 
00:36:58.069 --> 00:36:58.079 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you captain
 
00:36:58.079 --> 00:37:00.230 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you captain
um

00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
this is interesting
 
00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:04.400 align:start position:0%
i don't want to get into a commercial
 
00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
for e-foils
 
00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
but just out of curiosity when i had my
 
00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
sea doo and i would bring it you know
 
00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
through the weir's channel or or in
 
00:37:15.349 --> 00:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
various spots that even pagas bay
 
00:37:17.829 --> 00:37:17.839 align:start position:0%
it can be brutal out there i mean
 
00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
serious hard waves how does this thing
 
00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
go in in that kind of a chop because i
 
00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
know with my sidoo it was much more fun
 
00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
you know if you're going to just be
 
00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
going on a less chop of a surface and it
 
00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
was not nearly as life-threatening
 
00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
in the beginning yes because you can't
 
00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:42.150 align:start position:0%
in the beginning yes because you can't
start

00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:42.160 align:start position:0%
start
 
00:37:44.069 --> 00:37:44.079 align:start position:0%
out on this device in an upright
 
00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
position with the board out of the water
 
00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:48.160 align:start position:0%
so while the board is in the water and
 
00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
while that rider is getting the
 
00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
coordination and bringing it up to speed
 
00:37:54.069 --> 00:37:54.079 align:start position:0%
so that the foil itself starts to lift
 
00:37:54.079 --> 00:37:54.790 align:start position:0%
so that the foil itself starts to lift
you

00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:54.800 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:56.640 align:start position:0%
you are going to be subject to that chop
 
00:37:57.750 --> 00:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
that wave
 
00:37:59.829 --> 00:37:59.839 align:start position:0%
and in an awake zone you're going to
 
00:38:01.349 --> 00:38:01.359 align:start position:0%
have to be lying on the board because
 
00:38:03.589 --> 00:38:03.599 align:start position:0%
you can't by law exceed six miles an
 
00:38:03.599 --> 00:38:05.190 align:start position:0%
you can't by law exceed six miles an
hour

00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:05.200 align:start position:0%
hour
 
00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
interestingly once you are up and out of
 
00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
the water
 
00:38:11.589 --> 00:38:11.599 align:start position:0%
it's just this very narrow shaft that's
 
00:38:13.109 --> 00:38:13.119 align:start position:0%
that's plowing through these waves so
 
00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
you're not feeling the effect of the
 
00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:15.589 align:start position:0%
you're not feeling the effect of the
chalk

00:38:15.589 --> 00:38:15.599 align:start position:0%
chalk
 
00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:18.640 align:start position:0%
if you fall down you are now beneath
 
00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
you know you're in the you're not on the
 
00:38:21.829 --> 00:38:21.839 align:start position:0%
peak of the height of that wave you're
 
00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
in the trough and so
 
00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
there's going to be some
 
00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:28.160 align:start position:0%
some effort to get through that chop to
 
00:38:31.589 --> 00:38:31.599 align:start position:0%
get back to that elevated position
 
00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:39.109 --> 00:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
representative post for a third question
 
00:38:41.589 --> 00:38:41.599 align:start position:0%
yes um again thank you mr chair and
 
00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
thank you captain don levy so in in
 
00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:46.720 align:start position:0%
looking at this if someone falls off of
 
00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:47.910 align:start position:0%
looking at this if someone falls off of
it

00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of chop is that
 
00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
vessel just floating out
 
00:38:58.710 --> 00:38:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:00.310 --> 00:39:00.320 align:start position:0%
it would be a short distance away from
 
00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:02.560 align:start position:0%
the user uh and so there is going to
 
00:39:04.069 --> 00:39:04.079 align:start position:0%
need to be some effort on behalf of the
 
00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
user to get back to the to the machine
 
00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:10.630 align:start position:0%
user to get back to the to the machine
certainly

00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
any other questions from members of the
 
00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:15.990 align:start position:0%
any other questions from members of the
committee

00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
actually i have one one question just
 
00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
occurred to me
 
00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:23.200 align:start position:0%
now right now i understand there's
 
00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:24.470 align:start position:0%
now right now i understand there's
not

00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:26.720 align:start position:0%
tandem boards available
 
00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
but will there be
 
00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
uh it wouldn't surprise me
 
00:39:35.349 --> 00:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
representative over time
 
00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
certainly uh the developments in
 
00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:38.240 align:start position:0%
machines like this
 
00:39:41.349 --> 00:39:41.359 align:start position:0%
uh are developed to meet the appeal of
 
00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
the users and certainly we've seen
 
00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
certain devices in the past it started
 
00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
off as as being a device for one user
 
00:39:51.270 --> 00:39:51.280 align:start position:0%
that have expanded
 
00:39:53.349 --> 00:39:53.359 align:start position:0%
to many more
 
00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
obviously the advancement of the
 
00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
electric technology
 
00:39:58.310 --> 00:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
uh and the amount of power that the
 
00:40:01.349 --> 00:40:01.359 align:start position:0%
device will offer to support two people
 
00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:02.960 align:start position:0%
is probably happening faster than we all
 
00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
can imagine
 
00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
but that's my speculation
 
00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:40:09.349 --> 00:40:09.359 align:start position:0%
any other
 
00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
questions for members of the committee
 
00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
if not thank you very much
 
00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:40:17.589 --> 00:40:17.599 align:start position:0%
seeing seeing no other having no other
 
00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
pink cards
 
00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
and seeing no one
 
00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
looking to pass one along
 
00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:26.640 align:start position:0%
i'll declare the
 
00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
meeting the hearing closed on 13 16.
 
00:40:37.589 --> 00:40:37.599 align:start position:0%
and the next one will be in five minutes
 
00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:47.829 --> 00:41:47.839 align:start position:0%

00:47:15.349 --> 00:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:47:15.359 --> 00:47:16.630 align:start position:0%
all right
uh

00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:16.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:47:18.950 --> 00:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
we'll call the meeting to order for the
 
00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
hearing to order for
 
00:47:25.589 --> 00:47:25.599 align:start position:0%

hb 1317
 
00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
is a bill intended to keep the resource
 
00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
committees of both the house and senate
 
00:48:09.870 --> 00:48:09.880 align:start position:0%
aware of emerging electric or
 
00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
gasoline-powered boating technology
 
00:48:16.630 --> 00:48:16.640 align:start position:0%
that may present challenges
 
00:48:19.829 --> 00:48:19.839 align:start position:0%
to standing rules and
 
00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
it will encourage legislators to address
 
00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:28.640 align:start position:0%
in timely fashion
 
00:48:31.109 --> 00:48:31.119 align:start position:0%
potential safety or environmental
 
00:48:34.069 --> 00:48:34.079 align:start position:0%
impacts on new hampshire water bodies as
 
00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
well as possible conflicts with uses
 
00:48:39.270 --> 00:48:39.280 align:start position:0%
already taking place
 
00:48:41.349 --> 00:48:41.359 align:start position:0%
you have heard from me about the swift
 
00:48:44.069 --> 00:48:44.079 align:start position:0%
and growing appearance of efoils on our
 
00:48:45.750 --> 00:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
lakes and rivers
 
00:48:47.750 --> 00:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
three years ago i brought attention to
 
00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
the unknown environmental effects of
 
00:48:51.270 --> 00:48:51.280 align:start position:0%
wake boats
 
00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
i have no doubt
 
00:48:55.030 --> 00:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
that there will be more issues in the
 
00:48:57.190 --> 00:48:57.200 align:start position:0%
future from the products
 
00:49:00.790 --> 00:49:00.800 align:start position:0%
of the ingeniously inventive
 
00:49:03.829 --> 00:49:03.839 align:start position:0%
have i mentioned yet propelled motorized
 
00:49:03.839 --> 00:49:05.190 align:start position:0%

00:49:07.589 --> 00:49:07.599 align:start position:0%
the intention of this bill is that the

share with the appropriate legislative
 
00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:14.870 align:start position:0%
share with the appropriate legislative
committees

00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
committees
 
00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
knowledge gained through its access to
 
00:49:20.630 --> 00:49:20.640 align:start position:0%
reports from patrol officers of unique
 
00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:22.150 align:start position:0%

activity

00:49:22.150 --> 00:49:22.160 align:start position:0%
activity
 
00:49:24.309 --> 00:49:24.319 align:start position:0%
through complaints received throughout
 
00:49:26.950 --> 00:49:26.960 align:start position:0%
the state and through awareness gained
 
00:49:29.829 --> 00:49:29.839 align:start position:0%
from national conferences or educational
 
00:49:29.839 --> 00:49:30.870 align:start position:0%
from national conferences or educational
events

00:49:30.870 --> 00:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
events
 
00:49:33.990 --> 00:49:34.000 align:start position:0%
it may be that a report is one sentence
 
00:49:37.109 --> 00:49:37.119 align:start position:0%
or several pages its intention is to
 
00:49:40.390 --> 00:49:40.400 align:start position:0%
give legislators a heads up and a head
 
00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:41.829 align:start position:0%
give legislators a heads up and a head
start

00:49:41.829 --> 00:49:41.839 align:start position:0%
start
 
00:49:45.030 --> 00:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
and i would also say that
 
00:49:51.109 --> 00:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
i ask for your support to this
 
00:50:00.950 --> 00:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
00:50:04.470 --> 00:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
question i'm just curious um this bill
 
00:50:06.309 --> 00:50:06.319 align:start position:0%
as opposed to the previous bill why is
 
00:50:08.549 --> 00:50:08.559 align:start position:0%
there a difference in referencing marine
 
00:50:10.630 --> 00:50:10.640 align:start position:0%
patrol specifically in this bill
 
00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
and not the previous uh the intention
 
00:50:16.390 --> 00:50:16.400 align:start position:0%
would be the same and uh it would be
 
00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:20.480 align:start position:0%
whatever came to me out of ols and i did
 
00:50:22.710 --> 00:50:22.720 align:start position:0%
not pick up those differences thank you
 
00:50:23.670 --> 00:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
so much
 
00:50:29.670 --> 00:50:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:32.069 --> 00:50:32.079 align:start position:0%
representative representative post for a
 
00:50:32.079 --> 00:50:33.430 align:start position:0%
representative representative post for a
question

00:50:33.430 --> 00:50:33.440 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you i just
 
00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:37.829 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you i just
wonder

00:50:37.829 --> 00:50:37.839 align:start position:0%
wonder
 
00:50:39.829 --> 00:50:39.839 align:start position:0%
would this not happen under normal
 
00:50:39.839 --> 00:50:41.510 align:start position:0%
would this not happen under normal
reporting

00:50:41.510 --> 00:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
reporting
 
00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
uh i didn't have anybody contact me
 
00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:49.430 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:50:50.309 --> 00:50:50.319 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:50:50.319 --> 00:50:51.910 align:start position:0%
you know
no

00:50:51.910 --> 00:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:50:54.950 --> 00:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
that that was
 
00:50:57.670 --> 00:50:57.680 align:start position:0%
something that i saw happening and went
 
00:51:00.630 --> 00:51:00.640 align:start position:0%
ahead with it
 
00:51:04.390 --> 00:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
so i i don't think that we have a
 
00:51:06.790 --> 00:51:06.800 align:start position:0%
mechanism by which
 
00:51:08.710 --> 00:51:08.720 align:start position:0%
marine patrol
 
00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:10.069 align:start position:0%
marine patrol
uh

00:51:10.069 --> 00:51:10.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:51:13.510 --> 00:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
regularly reports the kind of thing i'm
 
00:51:14.790 --> 00:51:14.800 align:start position:0%
asking for
 
00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:20.309 --> 00:51:20.319 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up
 
00:51:22.870 --> 00:51:22.880 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:25.200 align:start position:0%
if it's going to be regulated by the
 
00:51:27.750 --> 00:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
federal government and that it's going
 
00:51:32.549 --> 00:51:32.559 align:start position:0%
to now be identified as a vessel
 
00:51:34.870 --> 00:51:34.880 align:start position:0%
would that not
 
00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
make it happen
 
00:51:39.190 --> 00:51:39.200 align:start position:0%
that they would report these kind of
 
00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:41.430 align:start position:0%
that they would report these kind of
things

00:51:41.430 --> 00:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh they might report they might report
 
00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
it to their patrol officers and other
 
00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
folks with enforcement uh but they're
 
00:51:51.270 --> 00:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
not necessarily going to report it to
 
00:51:53.349 --> 00:51:53.359 align:start position:0%
legislators for something that needs to
 
00:51:55.750 --> 00:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
be done
 
00:51:58.069 --> 00:51:58.079 align:start position:0%
or a follow-up so do we get any
 
00:52:00.710 --> 00:52:00.720 align:start position:0%
information on any other vessels that
 
00:52:02.710 --> 00:52:02.720 align:start position:0%
normally happens like that
 
00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
i would refer
 
00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:06.800 align:start position:0%
i have not
 
00:52:09.510 --> 00:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
thank you perhaps captain donnelly can
 
00:52:10.630 --> 00:52:10.640 align:start position:0%
answer that
 
00:52:13.270 --> 00:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
i i don't think we had any information
 
00:52:15.829 --> 00:52:15.839 align:start position:0%
about wake votes and potentials that
 
00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
came from
 
00:52:19.470 --> 00:52:19.480 align:start position:0%
really a lot of the protective
 
00:52:22.069 --> 00:52:22.079 align:start position:0%
associations throughout the state
 
00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
is where the awareness of that came from
 
00:52:26.790 --> 00:52:26.800 align:start position:0%
and that's why i didn't include it
 
00:52:29.910 --> 00:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
in here because i feel as if the
 
00:52:33.190 --> 00:52:33.200 align:start position:0%
protective associations pay attention to
 
00:52:35.589 --> 00:52:35.599 align:start position:0%
the cyanobacter
 
00:52:38.150 --> 00:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
bacteria and they pay attention to the
 
00:52:41.670 --> 00:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
milfoil and aquatic invasives
 
00:52:44.309 --> 00:52:44.319 align:start position:0%
and secondarily perhaps they would look
 
00:52:47.910 --> 00:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
at these emergency technologies but i
 
00:52:50.950 --> 00:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:53.349 --> 00:52:53.359 align:start position:0%
well i felt as if
 
00:52:55.670 --> 00:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
captain dunleavy gave us
 
00:52:58.630 --> 00:52:58.640 align:start position:0%
two instances of where we are going to
 
00:53:03.589 --> 00:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
and hopefully
 
00:53:07.109 --> 00:53:07.119 align:start position:0%
uh and you know and that would probably
 
00:53:10.549 --> 00:53:10.559 align:start position:0%
be done in the next session but who's
 
00:53:13.349 --> 00:53:13.359 align:start position:0%
going to remember it you know we
 
00:53:13.359 --> 00:53:14.549 align:start position:0%
going to remember it you know we
so

00:53:14.549 --> 00:53:14.559 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:53:16.470 --> 00:53:16.480 align:start position:0%
if that was sent
 
00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
either to members to the chairperson or
 
00:53:20.950 --> 00:53:20.960 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
00:53:23.589 --> 00:53:23.599 align:start position:0%
uh then somebody could say do i want to
 
00:53:26.549 --> 00:53:26.559 align:start position:0%
deal with that or not
 
00:53:28.470 --> 00:53:28.480 align:start position:0%
it's really just giving an
 
00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:29.990 align:start position:0%
it's really just giving an
opportunity

00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:30.870 align:start position:0%
opportunity
uh

00:53:30.870 --> 00:53:30.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:53:35.430 --> 00:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
to share in a more uh concrete
 
00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:36.630 align:start position:0%
to share in a more uh concrete
manner

00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:36.640 align:start position:0%
manner
 
00:53:38.790 --> 00:53:38.800 align:start position:0%
uh what they what they know and i know
 
00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
they have uh a bit of that captain
 
00:53:44.309 --> 00:53:44.319 align:start position:0%
dunleavy goes to a national conference
 
00:53:47.190 --> 00:53:47.200 align:start position:0%
and that uh he foils were under a lot of
 
00:53:49.589 --> 00:53:49.599 align:start position:0%
discussion at that
 
00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:52.720 align:start position:0%
so that was helpful to know that
 
00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
and my guess is you know i i spent a lot
 
00:53:57.990 --> 00:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
of time trying to imagine well what's
 
00:54:00.390 --> 00:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
going to be the next thing
 
00:54:02.710 --> 00:54:02.720 align:start position:0%
and i would encourage any of you who can
 
00:54:05.430 --> 00:54:05.440 align:start position:0%
think of something let me know
 
00:54:07.589 --> 00:54:07.599 align:start position:0%
we might make a fortune if we can
 
00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:13.670 --> 00:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
that answer your ques feel me that
 
00:54:15.990 --> 00:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
answer your question
 
00:54:18.549 --> 00:54:18.559 align:start position:0%
representative creighton for a question
 
00:54:23.349 --> 00:54:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
in your estimation what
 
00:54:27.750 --> 00:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
what is the scope of this report i mean
 
00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
is this a one page is it an email or is
 
00:54:33.589 --> 00:54:33.599 align:start position:0%
it a 500 page dissertation well i
 
00:54:36.470 --> 00:54:36.480 align:start position:0%
certainly hope it's not 500 pages and i
 
00:54:38.630 --> 00:54:38.640 align:start position:0%
think it would would be i i would think
 
00:54:40.549 --> 00:54:40.559 align:start position:0%
there might be a time when we've done
 
00:54:43.510 --> 00:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
such a brilliant job and people are you
 
00:54:45.589 --> 00:54:45.599 align:start position:0%
know so on top of things that it would
 
00:54:48.150 --> 00:54:48.160 align:start position:0%
be we have nothing to report
 
00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:49.030 align:start position:0%
be we have nothing to report
uh

00:54:49.030 --> 00:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:54:51.109 --> 00:54:51.119 align:start position:0%
the the one uh
 
00:54:53.109 --> 00:54:53.119 align:start position:0%
but i i would think it could be a
 
00:54:55.030 --> 00:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
summary of uh
 
00:54:57.430 --> 00:54:57.440 align:start position:0%
what they see might be coming down the
 
00:55:00.710 --> 00:55:00.720 align:start position:0%
path the pike particularly from uh when
 
00:55:03.510 --> 00:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
they get uh at this national conference
 
00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
or things like that
 
00:55:07.589 --> 00:55:07.599 align:start position:0%
yeah okay thank you ma'am
 
00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
but no i don't want 500 pages thank you
 
00:55:13.990 --> 00:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
is there any other questions
 
00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:21.109 --> 00:55:21.119 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
00:55:24.309 --> 00:55:24.319 align:start position:0%
i have no other questions uh or no other
 
00:55:25.829 --> 00:55:25.839 align:start position:0%
pink cards
 
00:55:25.839 --> 00:55:28.470 align:start position:0%
pink cards
uh

00:55:28.470 --> 00:55:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:30.309 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:55:30.309 --> 00:55:30.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:55:32.950 --> 00:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
represent representative harp for
 
00:55:35.829 --> 00:55:35.839 align:start position:0%
question or uh observation
 
00:55:38.069 --> 00:55:38.079 align:start position:0%
i have a combination of the both i
 
00:55:40.309 --> 00:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
thought maybe captain donnelly was going
 
00:55:41.670 --> 00:55:41.680 align:start position:0%
to come and say something i have a
 
00:55:43.510 --> 00:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
question for captain don livery if we
 
00:55:46.390 --> 00:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
can ask him to come forward
 
00:55:53.349 --> 00:55:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:55.270 --> 00:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
uh tim delavey department of safety
 
00:55:57.190 --> 00:55:57.200 align:start position:0%
marine patrol and i'm here for any
 
00:55:58.789 --> 00:55:58.799 align:start position:0%
questions you may have
 
00:56:01.270 --> 00:56:01.280 align:start position:0%
thank you captain for taking my question
 
00:56:04.069 --> 00:56:04.079 align:start position:0%
it was brought up and my concern is to
 
00:56:05.750 --> 00:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
mandate something that maybe the
 
00:56:07.829 --> 00:56:07.839 align:start position:0%
director's already doing does the
 
00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
director normally create an annual
 
00:56:12.950 --> 00:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
report that's available to anyone that
 
00:56:14.390 --> 00:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
can simply be
 
00:56:17.750 --> 00:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
sent to the committee without having to
 
00:56:20.950 --> 00:56:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:21.750 --> 00:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
00:56:23.750 --> 00:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
representative the department of safety
 
00:56:26.150 --> 00:56:26.160 align:start position:0%
does produce an annual report
 
00:56:28.549 --> 00:56:28.559 align:start position:0%
that document speaks mainly and we are
 
00:56:30.710 --> 00:56:30.720 align:start position:0%
included in that that document speaks
 
00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:32.720 align:start position:0%
mainly to what what we have done
 
00:56:35.750 --> 00:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
statistics uh what what the the agency
 
00:56:37.829 --> 00:56:37.839 align:start position:0%
has produced over the last uh fiscal
 
00:56:37.839 --> 00:56:39.670 align:start position:0%
has produced over the last uh fiscal
year

00:56:39.670 --> 00:56:39.680 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:56:42.470 --> 00:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
this type of report
 
00:56:45.270 --> 00:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
the legislature may consider four
 
00:56:47.349 --> 00:56:47.359 align:start position:0%
reasons that representative gottling
 
00:56:49.109 --> 00:56:49.119 align:start position:0%
specifically mentioned
 
00:56:51.109 --> 00:56:51.119 align:start position:0%
like weight boats but i i won't just
 
00:56:52.950 --> 00:56:52.960 align:start position:0%
i'll i'll throw out a couple of others
 
00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:54.630 align:start position:0%
i'll i'll throw out a couple of others
where

00:56:54.630 --> 00:56:54.640 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:56:57.349 --> 00:56:57.359 align:start position:0%
the legislature ultimately has seen
 
00:57:00.069 --> 00:57:00.079 align:start position:0%
an urgent need to somehow regulate in
 
00:57:03.750 --> 00:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
the in the late 80s it was the original
 
00:57:05.750 --> 00:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
jet skis
 
00:57:07.589 --> 00:57:07.599 align:start position:0%
now there's a lot of talk about wake
 
00:57:07.599 --> 00:57:10.069 align:start position:0%
now there's a lot of talk about wake
surfing

00:57:10.069 --> 00:57:10.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:12.230 --> 00:57:12.240 align:start position:0%
there are controversial activities that
 
00:57:13.829 --> 00:57:13.839 align:start position:0%
hit our waters where
 
00:57:16.309 --> 00:57:16.319 align:start position:0%
the competing uses of the public
 
00:57:16.319 --> 00:57:17.190 align:start position:0%
the competing uses of the public
uh

00:57:17.190 --> 00:57:17.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
are coming to your attention uh by your
 
00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:21.430 align:start position:0%
are coming to your attention uh by your
constituencies

00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
constituencies
 
00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:22.470 align:start position:0%
constituencies
um

00:57:22.470 --> 00:57:22.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:23.829 --> 00:57:23.839 align:start position:0%
marine patrol in the department of
 
00:57:26.789 --> 00:57:26.799 align:start position:0%
safety has historically absent
 
00:57:28.390 --> 00:57:28.400 align:start position:0%
a safety issue
 
00:57:31.270 --> 00:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
has historically stayed away from
 
00:57:34.950 --> 00:57:34.960 align:start position:0%
environmental conflicts user conflicts
 
00:57:36.789 --> 00:57:36.799 align:start position:0%
and allowing the boating public to
 
00:57:37.990 --> 00:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
decide whether it be through the
 
00:57:39.670 --> 00:57:39.680 align:start position:0%
legislative process for the hearings
 
00:57:41.670 --> 00:57:41.680 align:start position:0%
process on the administrative rules side
 
00:57:43.190 --> 00:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
as to how they want to be regulated in
 
00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
that activity
 
00:57:48.230 --> 00:57:48.240 align:start position:0%
and and sometimes the the issue uh
 
00:57:50.069 --> 00:57:50.079 align:start position:0%
becomes so large so quickly that you
 
00:57:52.069 --> 00:57:52.079 align:start position:0%
folks are blindsided by it and i can
 
00:57:54.710 --> 00:57:54.720 align:start position:0%
only uh guess that that's representative
 
00:57:57.349 --> 00:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
gotling's intent here
 
00:57:59.829 --> 00:57:59.839 align:start position:0%
us filing a report might be similar to
 
00:58:02.549 --> 00:58:02.559 align:start position:0%
what some of the ongoing legislative uh
 
00:58:04.549 --> 00:58:04.559 align:start position:0%
created committees like lakes management
 
00:58:06.870 --> 00:58:06.880 align:start position:0%
advisory aquatic invasive species
 
00:58:08.950 --> 00:58:08.960 align:start position:0%
committees that there are a multitude of
 
00:58:10.549 --> 00:58:10.559 align:start position:0%
them there are none out there that
 
00:58:12.470 --> 00:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
specifically address voting
 
00:58:14.789 --> 00:58:14.799 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:58:16.309 --> 00:58:16.319 align:start position:0%
whether this report whether it be one
 
00:58:18.789 --> 00:58:18.799 align:start position:0%
page two pages just to say hey this is
 
00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
coming or this is what we're seeing for
 
00:58:21.829 --> 00:58:21.839 align:start position:0%
trends we leave it up to you as to
 
00:58:22.789 --> 00:58:22.799 align:start position:0%
whether you want to hear about that or
 
00:58:22.799 --> 00:58:24.549 align:start position:0%
whether you want to hear about that or
not

00:58:24.549 --> 00:58:24.559 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:58:30.309 --> 00:58:30.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:32.710 --> 00:58:32.720 align:start position:0%
representative smith for a question
 
00:58:36.069 --> 00:58:36.079 align:start position:0%
thank you captain dunleavy um yes and um
 
00:58:38.549 --> 00:58:38.559 align:start position:0%
as chair of the aquatic invasive weeds
 
00:58:40.230 --> 00:58:40.240 align:start position:0%
and species committee
 
00:58:43.109 --> 00:58:43.119 align:start position:0%
um amy smagula who is our
 
00:58:46.069 --> 00:58:46.079 align:start position:0%
finger on the pulse person for the
 
00:58:46.079 --> 00:58:47.030 align:start position:0%
finger on the pulse person for the
state

00:58:47.030 --> 00:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:58:49.589 --> 00:58:49.599 align:start position:0%
what's happening in the invasives world
 
00:58:51.990 --> 00:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
does report to us at meetings it's very
 
00:58:53.829 --> 00:58:53.839 align:start position:0%
casual it's in the course of her monthly
 
00:58:53.839 --> 00:58:54.870 align:start position:0%
casual it's in the course of her monthly
report

00:58:54.870 --> 00:58:54.880 align:start position:0%
report
 
00:58:57.270 --> 00:58:57.280 align:start position:0%
and so i think that and it doesn't
 
00:58:59.190 --> 00:58:59.200 align:start position:0%
require us to do anything but it gives
 
00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
us the heads up that water chestnut was
 
00:59:03.349 --> 00:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
found here this one's coming from
 
00:59:05.829 --> 00:59:05.839 align:start position:0%
another state and i think something like
 
00:59:08.150 --> 00:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
that could be very helpful um for us
 
00:59:09.990 --> 00:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
just to know you know if when you're at
 
00:59:12.230 --> 00:59:12.240 align:start position:0%
your annual meetings your national
 
00:59:13.589 --> 00:59:13.599 align:start position:0%
meetings that
 
00:59:15.510 --> 00:59:15.520 align:start position:0%
what's happening in colorado could be
 
00:59:18.549 --> 00:59:18.559 align:start position:0%
happening here in a year or two and just
 
00:59:20.309 --> 00:59:20.319 align:start position:0%
kind of give us the heads up i think
 
00:59:22.789 --> 00:59:22.799 align:start position:0%
that would be good is that a reasonable
 
00:59:25.990 --> 00:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
request and the question is
 
00:59:28.470 --> 00:59:28.480 align:start position:0%
it doesn't look like that this bill is
 
00:59:32.950 --> 00:59:32.960 align:start position:0%
requiring a formal
 
00:59:36.309 --> 00:59:36.319 align:start position:0%
review report kind of a thing it doesn't
 
00:59:38.630 --> 00:59:38.640 align:start position:0%
looks look to be
 
00:59:38.640 --> 00:59:40.230 align:start position:0%
looks look to be
unbearably

00:59:40.230 --> 00:59:40.240 align:start position:0%
unbearably
 
00:59:43.349 --> 00:59:43.359 align:start position:0%
challenging to complete is that correct
 
00:59:45.430 --> 00:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
in your opinion
 
00:59:48.390 --> 00:59:48.400 align:start position:0%
based of one i've seen what i've read uh
 
00:59:49.990 --> 00:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
i i don't anticipate it being a heavy
 
00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
lift if i can use that expression okay
 
00:59:55.430 --> 00:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:57.910 --> 00:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
representative post for a question
 
00:59:59.510 --> 00:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much chair and thank you
 
01:00:02.470 --> 01:00:02.480 align:start position:0%
mr uh captain dunleavy um
 
01:00:06.309 --> 01:00:06.319 align:start position:0%
again i i wonder do we really need a
 
01:00:06.319 --> 01:00:07.109 align:start position:0%
again i i wonder do we really need a
bill

01:00:07.109 --> 01:00:07.119 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
to have you report on this for us
 
01:00:11.910 --> 01:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
and it could it just be in the normal
 
01:00:16.150 --> 01:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:17.670 --> 01:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
uh with all due respect i would say
 
01:00:19.829 --> 01:00:19.839 align:start position:0%
that's up to you folks uh i i don't know
 
01:00:19.839 --> 01:00:20.950 align:start position:0%
that's up to you folks uh i i don't know
what

01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:00:23.990 --> 01:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
what um would be required of us if this
 
01:00:26.069 --> 01:00:26.079 align:start position:0%
if there wasn't this bill
 
01:00:28.470 --> 01:00:28.480 align:start position:0%
uh if there's just a simple request by
 
01:00:30.950 --> 01:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
the committee to come and before you and
 
01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
give you updates i i don't know what
 
01:00:34.789 --> 01:00:34.799 align:start position:0%
mechanisms exist to do that i know we
 
01:00:34.799 --> 01:00:35.910 align:start position:0%
mechanisms exist to do that i know we
routinely

01:00:35.910 --> 01:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
routinely
 
01:00:37.829 --> 01:00:37.839 align:start position:0%
share opportunities with boat rides for
 
01:00:39.430 --> 01:00:39.440 align:start position:0%
you folks as a committee in the past and
 
01:00:41.510 --> 01:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of conversation
 
01:00:43.829 --> 01:00:43.839 align:start position:0%
which which we as an agency enjoy
 
01:00:43.839 --> 01:00:44.870 align:start position:0%
which which we as an agency enjoy
um

01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:46.630 --> 01:00:46.640 align:start position:0%
but but but if that doesn't happen
 
01:00:48.870 --> 01:00:48.880 align:start position:0%
because of covet or what have you uh
 
01:00:50.870 --> 01:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
what how we get that information to you
 
01:00:58.549 --> 01:00:58.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:00.150 --> 01:01:00.160 align:start position:0%
any other questions by members of the
 
01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:02.390 align:start position:0%
any other questions by members of the
committee

01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:01:04.390 --> 01:01:04.400 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much and
 
01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
could you put a in a pink card
 
01:01:12.150 --> 01:01:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:15.190 --> 01:01:15.200 align:start position:0%
seeing no additional
 
01:01:18.230 --> 01:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
testimony be no additional pink cards
 
01:01:21.589 --> 01:01:21.599 align:start position:0%
i'll declare the hearing on house bill
 
01:01:25.270 --> 01:01:25.280 align:start position:0%
1317 closed
 
01:01:36.549 --> 01:01:36.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
let's see
 
01:01:41.670 --> 01:01:41.680 align:start position:0%
we've got 1.3 million people that keep
 
01:01:44.630 --> 01:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
us surprised at what's going on
 
01:01:47.030 --> 01:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
i don't know why we need to do it
 
01:01:48.630 --> 01:01:48.640 align:start position:0%
we can ask him if he wants to make a
 
01:01:48.640 --> 01:02:04.069 align:start position:0%
we can ask him if he wants to make a
presentation

01:02:04.069 --> 01:02:04.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:04.079 --> 01:02:19.109 align:start position:0%
 
somebody

01:02:19.109 --> 01:02:19.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:39.829 --> 01:04:39.839 align:start position:0%

okay

01:32:00.310 --> 01:32:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:02.470 --> 01:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
i'd like to call the meeting to order
 
01:32:02.480 --> 01:32:03.430 align:start position:0%
i'd like to call the meeting to order
for

01:32:03.430 --> 01:32:03.440 align:start position:0%

01:32:12.950 --> 01:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
person other than
 
01:32:16.550 --> 01:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
the permit holder and
 
01:32:18.629 --> 01:32:18.639 align:start position:0%
i'd like to recognize
 
01:32:20.870 --> 01:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor
 
01:32:24.550 --> 01:32:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:28.070 --> 01:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
representative the floor is yours
 
01:32:30.629 --> 01:32:30.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and uh good morning
 
01:32:32.950 --> 01:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
members of the uh committee
 
01:32:34.950 --> 01:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
for the record i'm peter teroshan i
 
01:32:37.350 --> 01:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
represent rockingham county district 14
 
01:32:39.110 --> 01:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
which is the towns of atkinson in
 
01:32:41.270 --> 01:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
plaistow as you heard i'm the prime
 
01:32:43.910 --> 01:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this legislation
 
01:32:46.550 --> 01:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
and this is a relatively straightforward
 
01:32:49.510 --> 01:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
and simple intent here
 
01:32:51.430 --> 01:32:51.440 align:start position:0%
what this
 
01:32:53.430 --> 01:32:53.440 align:start position:0%
legislation attempts to do
 
01:32:55.030 --> 01:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
is to allow
 
01:32:55.040 --> 01:32:56.149 align:start position:0%
is to allow
the

01:32:56.149 --> 01:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:32:58.629 --> 01:32:58.639 align:start position:0%
permit holder of a mooring and it's
 
01:33:00.790 --> 01:33:00.800 align:start position:0%
intended to be coastal moorings
 
01:33:02.390 --> 01:33:02.400 align:start position:0%
of which most of you know we have very
 
01:33:02.400 --> 01:33:03.430 align:start position:0%
of which most of you know we have very
limited

01:33:03.430 --> 01:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
limited
 
01:33:05.270 --> 01:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
coast here in new hampshire
 
01:33:06.390 --> 01:33:06.400 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:33:08.790 --> 01:33:08.800 align:start position:0%
resource of which
 
01:33:11.590 --> 01:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
uh moorings are in uh is very limited
 
01:33:13.350 --> 01:33:13.360 align:start position:0%
it's not uncommon to see waiting lists
 
01:33:15.510 --> 01:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
that go 20 years plus
 
01:33:17.430 --> 01:33:17.440 align:start position:0%
so so what this legislation is
 
01:33:19.270 --> 01:33:19.280 align:start position:0%
attempting to do
 
01:33:20.629 --> 01:33:20.639 align:start position:0%
is to allow
 
01:33:22.629 --> 01:33:22.639 align:start position:0%
the permit holder
 
01:33:22.639 --> 01:33:23.510 align:start position:0%
the permit holder
that

01:33:23.510 --> 01:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:33:25.430 --> 01:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
and just let me explain how this works
 
01:33:27.669 --> 01:33:27.679 align:start position:0%
when you
 
01:33:30.390 --> 01:33:30.400 align:start position:0%
get a mooring in the state
 
01:33:32.790 --> 01:33:32.800 align:start position:0%
you pay a fee to the state to use that
 
01:33:32.800 --> 01:33:34.229 align:start position:0%
you pay a fee to the state to use that
location

01:33:34.229 --> 01:33:34.239 align:start position:0%
location
 
01:33:36.390 --> 01:33:36.400 align:start position:0%
but you put down the tackle
 
01:33:39.430 --> 01:33:39.440 align:start position:0%
um which is the chain the block
 
01:33:41.669 --> 01:33:41.679 align:start position:0%
the hmong ball and so forth
 
01:33:43.110 --> 01:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
that should that's property that you
 
01:33:45.590 --> 01:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
have to provide the state gets a fee for
 
01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:46.390 align:start position:0%
have to provide the state gets a fee for
that

01:33:46.390 --> 01:33:46.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:33:48.310 --> 01:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
so right now for the by and large the
 
01:33:51.110 --> 01:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
moorings and the coastal zone
 
01:33:53.189 --> 01:33:53.199 align:start position:0%
are all rented out so the state is
 
01:33:53.199 --> 01:33:54.870 align:start position:0%
are all rented out so the state is
getting

01:33:54.870 --> 01:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
getting
 
01:33:56.709 --> 01:33:56.719 align:start position:0%
their dollar amount whatever it totals
 
01:33:57.910 --> 01:33:57.920 align:start position:0%
up to i couldn't tell you the exact
 
01:33:57.920 --> 01:34:00.070 align:start position:0%
up to i couldn't tell you the exact
number

01:34:00.070 --> 01:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
number
 
01:34:01.990 --> 01:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
but what happens and i've been
 
01:34:03.910 --> 01:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
approached by several salem boat clubs
 
01:34:05.990 --> 01:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
in other boaters and i'm a boater myself
 
01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:06.709 align:start position:0%
in other boaters and i'm a boater myself
and

01:34:06.709 --> 01:34:06.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:34:09.350 --> 01:34:09.360 align:start position:0%
have familiarity with
 
01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:10.149 align:start position:0%
have familiarity with
the

01:34:10.149 --> 01:34:10.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:34:12.629 --> 01:34:12.639 align:start position:0%
what goes on with the moorings
 
01:34:14.390 --> 01:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
it's not uncommon in the summer to see a
 
01:34:15.669 --> 01:34:15.679 align:start position:0%
quarter to a third of moorings in the
 
01:34:19.590 --> 01:34:19.600 align:start position:0%
coastal mooring fields go unused at
 
01:34:21.750 --> 01:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
least for some of the summer
 
01:34:24.149 --> 01:34:24.159 align:start position:0%
so this bill does not allow the more the
 
01:34:26.149 --> 01:34:26.159 align:start position:0%
permit holder to
 
01:34:27.590 --> 01:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:34:30.629 --> 01:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
change ownership or change the um
 
01:34:32.070 --> 01:34:32.080 align:start position:0%
the lease if you want to call it that to
 
01:34:34.310 --> 01:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
that area to somebody else but what it
 
01:34:35.270 --> 01:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
does do
 
01:34:37.750 --> 01:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
it allows them to
 
01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:39.270 align:start position:0%
it allows them to
let

01:34:39.270 --> 01:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
let
 
01:34:42.550 --> 01:34:42.560 align:start position:0%
other boaters use the mooring uh
 
01:34:44.070 --> 01:34:44.080 align:start position:0%
and it's there's no cost involved so
 
01:34:46.149 --> 01:34:46.159 align:start position:0%
that you can't charge to use it and the
 
01:34:47.669 --> 01:34:47.679 align:start position:0%
reason why there's two reasons why this
 
01:34:50.229 --> 01:34:50.239 align:start position:0%
is important one is that
 
01:34:51.990 --> 01:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
it's again a limited resource that's
 
01:34:54.149 --> 01:34:54.159 align:start position:0%
being under utilized
 
01:34:54.159 --> 01:34:55.030 align:start position:0%
being under utilized
many

01:34:55.030 --> 01:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
many
 
01:34:56.870 --> 01:34:56.880 align:start position:0%
people that have moorings they use their
 
01:34:58.950 --> 01:34:58.960 align:start position:0%
boats and they travel sometimes for a
 
01:35:01.830 --> 01:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
week or longer up the coast and
 
01:35:04.229 --> 01:35:04.239 align:start position:0%
day trips and so forth and sail clubs
 
01:35:06.229 --> 01:35:06.239 align:start position:0%
put together a list of people in their
 
01:35:08.709 --> 01:35:08.719 align:start position:0%
locations because as many clubs we have
 
01:35:10.709 --> 01:35:10.719 align:start position:0%
membership up and down the east coast so
 
01:35:13.990 --> 01:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
if somebody's traveling into the region
 
01:35:15.510 --> 01:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
and you remember that club you can put
 
01:35:16.790 --> 01:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
it down i'm going to be gone for two
 
01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:17.669 align:start position:0%
it down i'm going to be gone for two
weeks

01:35:17.669 --> 01:35:17.679 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
01:35:20.470 --> 01:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
from the first to the 15th of august
 
01:35:21.910 --> 01:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
my moorings available because i'll be
 
01:35:24.390 --> 01:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
off of it so this allows
 
01:35:27.030 --> 01:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
people to use those moorings that
 
01:35:30.390 --> 01:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
otherwise go unused why is that good
 
01:35:32.070 --> 01:35:32.080 align:start position:0%
because it brings people into new
 
01:35:34.070 --> 01:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire that may spend money in the
 
01:35:36.390 --> 01:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
state in the local towns they may
 
01:35:37.750 --> 01:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
otherwise go somewhere else in new
 
01:35:39.270 --> 01:35:39.280 align:start position:0%
report mass
 
01:35:42.390 --> 01:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
you know up to maine so
 
01:35:44.629 --> 01:35:44.639 align:start position:0%
again it just to be clear this does not
 
01:35:47.189 --> 01:35:47.199 align:start position:0%
allow you as the permit holder to
 
01:35:48.709 --> 01:35:48.719 align:start position:0%
change the ownership of the lease
 
01:35:50.709 --> 01:35:50.719 align:start position:0%
arrangement that's that's still exactly
 
01:35:52.390 --> 01:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
the same with the port authority that
 
01:35:53.910 --> 01:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
controls this
 
01:35:55.669 --> 01:35:55.679 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't affect the amount of
 
01:35:57.109 --> 01:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
money that the state
 
01:35:57.119 --> 01:35:58.070 align:start position:0%
money that the state
collects

01:35:58.070 --> 01:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
collects
 
01:35:59.830 --> 01:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
it simply allows that
 
01:36:02.149 --> 01:36:02.159 align:start position:0%
unused resource to be used
 
01:36:03.910 --> 01:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
more than it is now
 
01:36:07.030 --> 01:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
and it has potential economic benefits
 
01:36:10.790 --> 01:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
to the state and the local towns
 
01:36:13.990 --> 01:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
and so i hope you support an otp
 
01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:14.870 align:start position:0%
and so i hope you support an otp
on

01:36:14.870 --> 01:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:36:16.870 --> 01:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
house bill 1438 now i noticed they put
 
01:36:19.270 --> 01:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
an f in on there and i haven't had any
 
01:36:21.030 --> 01:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
notification from anybody as to why
 
01:36:22.950 --> 01:36:22.960 align:start position:0%
there should be a fiscal note on this
 
01:36:24.709 --> 01:36:24.719 align:start position:0%
bill i i can't see where this would cost
 
01:36:25.990 --> 01:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
any money at all
 
01:36:27.750 --> 01:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
and quite frankly if you look at that
 
01:36:27.760 --> 01:36:30.390 align:start position:0%
and quite frankly if you look at that
page

01:36:30.390 --> 01:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:31.830 --> 01:36:31.840 align:start position:0%
there's no real information in there to
 
01:36:34.229 --> 01:36:34.239 align:start position:0%
suggest there should be any cost
 
01:36:38.390 --> 01:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
so i believe that the the
 
01:36:40.229 --> 01:36:40.239 align:start position:0%
very little cost of any i don't believe
 
01:36:42.149 --> 01:36:42.159 align:start position:0%
there would be
 
01:36:44.149 --> 01:36:44.159 align:start position:0%
with that i'll take any questions that
 
01:36:45.590 --> 01:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
committee members may have in regard to
 
01:36:51.990 --> 01:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:54.470 --> 01:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony any uh
 
01:36:58.070 --> 01:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
questions uh representative cohen
 
01:37:00.629 --> 01:37:00.639 align:start position:0%
followed by representative uh gold
 
01:37:01.990 --> 01:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
brisbane thank you for taking my
 
01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:03.030 align:start position:0%
brisbane thank you for taking my
question

01:37:03.030 --> 01:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:37:06.629 --> 01:37:06.639 align:start position:0%
um what kind of enforcement would be
 
01:37:08.470 --> 01:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
happening here if i know it says no
 
01:37:10.470 --> 01:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
person in the bill shall be charged for
 
01:37:12.470 --> 01:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
the use of the mooring by any other
 
01:37:14.550 --> 01:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
person but what if
 
01:37:16.629 --> 01:37:16.639 align:start position:0%
somebody starts using their mourn like
 
01:37:19.669 --> 01:37:19.679 align:start position:0%
an ab airbnb so you rent it out by the
 
01:37:19.679 --> 01:37:20.390 align:start position:0%
an ab airbnb so you rent it out by the
day

01:37:20.390 --> 01:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
day
 
01:37:21.830 --> 01:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
and it's found out either it's
 
01:37:23.510 --> 01:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
advertised or something what is the
 
01:37:25.830 --> 01:37:25.840 align:start position:0%
mechanism for enforcement of not
 
01:37:27.270 --> 01:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
charging someone
 
01:37:30.390 --> 01:37:30.400 align:start position:0%
to rent or use your mooring
 
01:37:31.830 --> 01:37:31.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative for the
 
01:37:34.310 --> 01:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
question so there isn't a mechanism per
 
01:37:35.910 --> 01:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
se in this bill
 
01:37:37.590 --> 01:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
but let me just give you the current law
 
01:37:39.030 --> 01:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
the current law
 
01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:39.910 align:start position:0%
the current law
um

01:37:39.910 --> 01:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:41.669 --> 01:37:41.679 align:start position:0%
says you can't let anybody use the
 
01:37:43.830 --> 01:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
mooring period now if you do and some
 
01:37:45.189 --> 01:37:45.199 align:start position:0%
people do
 
01:37:46.709 --> 01:37:46.719 align:start position:0%
and you get caught i don't know what's
 
01:37:48.629 --> 01:37:48.639 align:start position:0%
in current stature that that has a
 
01:37:51.030 --> 01:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
punitive amount there may or may not be
 
01:37:52.709 --> 01:37:52.719 align:start position:0%
something there
 
01:37:52.719 --> 01:37:53.910 align:start position:0%
something there
so

01:37:53.910 --> 01:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:37:57.030 --> 01:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
you know the bottom line is that
 
01:37:58.870 --> 01:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
this is something that's it's not
 
01:38:01.270 --> 01:38:01.280 align:start position:0%
intended to
 
01:38:02.950 --> 01:38:02.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily have a punitive
 
01:38:05.350 --> 01:38:05.360 align:start position:0%
uh measure but it is intended again to
 
01:38:08.470 --> 01:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
make that resource usable and the reason
 
01:38:10.790 --> 01:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
i put in not for hire is because
 
01:38:12.870 --> 01:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
where there is a waiting list on many of
 
01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:13.990 align:start position:0%
where there is a waiting list on many of
these

01:38:13.990 --> 01:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:38:16.070 --> 01:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
we don't want people to abuse that in in
 
01:38:17.830 --> 01:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
and lease it out year after year and not
 
01:38:19.189 --> 01:38:19.199 align:start position:0%
let that mooring go back into the
 
01:38:20.870 --> 01:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
available pool and that's the reason why
 
01:38:23.109 --> 01:38:23.119 align:start position:0%
i made it uh not for
 
01:38:26.149 --> 01:38:26.159 align:start position:0%
no cost involved
 
01:38:27.430 --> 01:38:27.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for the answer to your quest
 
01:38:30.709 --> 01:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:34.390 --> 01:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:36.790 --> 01:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
01:38:38.790 --> 01:38:38.800 align:start position:0%
representative erosion uh just a quick
 
01:38:40.310 --> 01:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
question what if somebody knew the
 
01:38:42.470 --> 01:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
person was away for a month
 
01:38:43.669 --> 01:38:43.679 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:38:48.550 --> 01:38:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:51.109 --> 01:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
well uh webinar school thank you for the
 
01:38:51.119 --> 01:38:52.229 align:start position:0%
well uh webinar school thank you for the
question

01:38:52.229 --> 01:38:52.239 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:38:54.470 --> 01:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
i mean that could happen now i suppose
 
01:38:57.590 --> 01:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
um as a general rule i i think most
 
01:38:57.600 --> 01:38:59.030 align:start position:0%
um as a general rule i i think most
people

01:38:59.030 --> 01:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:39:00.629 --> 01:39:00.639 align:start position:0%
work on an honor system that doesn't
 
01:39:02.229 --> 01:39:02.239 align:start position:0%
mean for a night or two people might
 
01:39:03.750 --> 01:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
might slip onto a mooring and use it
 
01:39:05.189 --> 01:39:05.199 align:start position:0%
that does happen
 
01:39:07.350 --> 01:39:07.360 align:start position:0%
in other states as well
 
01:39:10.870 --> 01:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
but right now if somebody uses it
 
01:39:12.870 --> 01:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
whether they have permission or not if
 
01:39:15.109 --> 01:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
they're violating a current statute and
 
01:39:17.270 --> 01:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
that's this seeks to
 
01:39:19.189 --> 01:39:19.199 align:start position:0%
to give some flexibility again and
 
01:39:21.830 --> 01:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
letting that unused mooring
 
01:39:23.830 --> 01:39:23.840 align:start position:0%
become valuable for
 
01:39:27.030 --> 01:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
hopefully potential increased economic
 
01:39:33.750 --> 01:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:34.950 --> 01:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
representative connor then
 
01:39:37.270 --> 01:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
representative huff
 
01:39:38.550 --> 01:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
01:39:40.709 --> 01:39:40.719 align:start position:0%
taking my question does marine patrol
 
01:39:40.719 --> 01:39:42.149 align:start position:0%
taking my question does marine patrol
currently

01:39:42.149 --> 01:39:42.159 align:start position:0%
currently
 
01:39:44.070 --> 01:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
actually patrol the moorings to make
 
01:39:46.470 --> 01:39:46.480 align:start position:0%
sure that the properly licensed person
 
01:39:48.870 --> 01:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
is using their mooring
 
01:39:51.350 --> 01:39:51.360 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question representative
 
01:39:52.950 --> 01:39:52.960 align:start position:0%
i know that in
 
01:39:55.270 --> 01:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
the inland waterways that that is
 
01:39:57.350 --> 01:39:57.360 align:start position:0%
something that happens and marine patrol
 
01:40:01.669 --> 01:40:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:03.030 --> 01:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
i guess they could to the extent that
 
01:40:06.870 --> 01:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
they know who the permit holder is
 
01:40:08.790 --> 01:40:08.800 align:start position:0%
the port authority which has the
 
01:40:10.950 --> 01:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction for issuing these moorings
 
01:40:15.189 --> 01:40:15.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:17.030 --> 01:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
they are the ones that would know you
 
01:40:18.229 --> 01:40:18.239 align:start position:0%
know if they see a different boat
 
01:40:19.669 --> 01:40:19.679 align:start position:0%
different color different name than what
 
01:40:21.030 --> 01:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
the permit holder is that perhaps
 
01:40:23.189 --> 01:40:23.199 align:start position:0%
somebody's using that mooring that's not
 
01:40:25.109 --> 01:40:25.119 align:start position:0%
the permit holder so
 
01:40:26.470 --> 01:40:26.480 align:start position:0%
if somebody's out patrolling that
 
01:40:27.910 --> 01:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
earring doesn't know who the permit
 
01:40:29.109 --> 01:40:29.119 align:start position:0%
holders are they
 
01:40:31.270 --> 01:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
probably don't know whether or not
 
01:40:33.910 --> 01:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
um it's a foreign boat other than if
 
01:40:35.990 --> 01:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
they're trolling on a regular basis they
 
01:40:37.990 --> 01:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
get to know what boats look like on
 
01:40:39.270 --> 01:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
different moorings so they might have an
 
01:40:39.280 --> 01:40:42.550 align:start position:0%
different moorings so they might have an
idea

01:40:42.550 --> 01:40:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:44.149 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

01:40:44.149 --> 01:40:44.159 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:40:45.990 --> 01:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
thank you so much do you foresee this
 
01:40:47.830 --> 01:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
becoming an enforcement issue for either
 
01:40:49.750 --> 01:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
port authority or marine patrol not
 
01:40:51.750 --> 01:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
knowing who has permission to be on a
 
01:40:54.550 --> 01:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
mooring and who does not have permission
 
01:40:57.030 --> 01:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
no because again um
 
01:40:59.350 --> 01:40:59.360 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:41:02.070 --> 01:41:02.080 align:start position:0%
it's likely many people don't know
 
01:41:03.590 --> 01:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
exactly who the permit holder is other
 
01:41:05.830 --> 01:41:05.840 align:start position:0%
than the port authority so i don't see
 
01:41:08.149 --> 01:41:08.159 align:start position:0%
this causing any problems with increased
 
01:41:08.159 --> 01:41:09.910 align:start position:0%
this causing any problems with increased
enforcement

01:41:09.910 --> 01:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
01:41:12.470 --> 01:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
um and the average person is probably
 
01:41:14.390 --> 01:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
not going to know
 
01:41:15.669 --> 01:41:15.679 align:start position:0%
many people don't know what the law is
 
01:41:17.590 --> 01:41:17.600 align:start position:0%
now and if we change
 
01:41:19.270 --> 01:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
the statue here
 
01:41:21.109 --> 01:41:21.119 align:start position:0%
they may not know either but
 
01:41:23.189 --> 01:41:23.199 align:start position:0%
sale clubs primarily and
 
01:41:24.709 --> 01:41:24.719 align:start position:0%
both you know voters individually will
 
01:41:27.109 --> 01:41:27.119 align:start position:0%
get to know and hopefully put
 
01:41:30.870 --> 01:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:33.030 --> 01:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
representative huff for question thank
 
01:41:34.390 --> 01:41:34.400 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman and thank you
 
01:41:36.709 --> 01:41:36.719 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question um
 
01:41:38.390 --> 01:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
i'm just curious
 
01:41:40.950 --> 01:41:40.960 align:start position:0%
and this is just a wording uh thing here
 
01:41:42.950 --> 01:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
where it says um
 
01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:44.790 align:start position:0%
where it says um
uh

01:41:44.790 --> 01:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:41:46.550 --> 01:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
in line four uh the holder of a mooring
 
01:41:48.950 --> 01:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
permit may transfer such a permit to a
 
01:41:52.149 --> 01:41:52.159 align:start position:0%
different person for use up to 30 days
 
01:41:53.750 --> 01:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
does that mean
 
01:41:55.830 --> 01:41:55.840 align:start position:0%
and bear with me on this does that mean
 
01:41:57.109 --> 01:41:57.119 align:start position:0%
only one
 
01:41:59.910 --> 01:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
person can get that or can multiple
 
01:42:01.830 --> 01:42:01.840 align:start position:0%
throughout the season get it
 
01:42:01.840 --> 01:42:02.709 align:start position:0%
throughout the season get it
can

01:42:02.709 --> 01:42:02.719 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:42:04.390 --> 01:42:04.400 align:start position:0%
in other words let me let me back up a
 
01:42:07.430 --> 01:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
second okay so i'm reading this as a
 
01:42:09.510 --> 01:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
different person so in other words i own
 
01:42:11.910 --> 01:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
the mooring you come along and you want
 
01:42:14.070 --> 01:42:14.080 align:start position:0%
to have it for however long i say okay
 
01:42:16.070 --> 01:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
and then after you're done using it
 
01:42:18.629 --> 01:42:18.639 align:start position:0%
that's it there's no other can i get
 
01:42:20.310 --> 01:42:20.320 align:start position:0%
someone else
 
01:42:21.990 --> 01:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
do you see what i'm saying yes so so the
 
01:42:24.950 --> 01:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
way i i interpret the language is that
 
01:42:24.960 --> 01:42:27.030 align:start position:0%
way i i interpret the language is that
um

01:42:27.030 --> 01:42:27.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:30.229 --> 01:42:30.239 align:start position:0%
the mooring may be again um transferred
 
01:42:32.629 --> 01:42:32.639 align:start position:0%
to a different person so meaning a
 
01:42:34.229 --> 01:42:34.239 align:start position:0%
different person is somebody other than
 
01:42:36.550 --> 01:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
you as a permit holder okay in for up to
 
01:42:38.310 --> 01:42:38.320 align:start position:0%
30 days so it doesn't have to be the
 
01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:39.189 align:start position:0%
30 days so it doesn't have to be the
same

01:42:39.189 --> 01:42:39.199 align:start position:0%
same
 
01:42:39.199 --> 01:42:40.310 align:start position:0%
same
um

01:42:40.310 --> 01:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:41.750 --> 01:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
different person
 
01:42:43.510 --> 01:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
if somebody could use it for
 
01:42:44.709 --> 01:42:44.719 align:start position:0%
a weekend
 
01:42:46.229 --> 01:42:46.239 align:start position:0%
and then somewhere
 
01:42:48.390 --> 01:42:48.400 align:start position:0%
in the 30-day period
 
01:42:49.910 --> 01:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
you could let somebody else choose it
 
01:42:51.590 --> 01:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
and again i limit it to 30 days because
 
01:42:53.350 --> 01:42:53.360 align:start position:0%
i don't want there to be an abuse of
 
01:42:55.030 --> 01:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
people that
 
01:42:56.950 --> 01:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
don't have a vessel on the mooring and
 
01:42:58.950 --> 01:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
they don't turn it back in
 
01:43:00.629 --> 01:43:00.639 align:start position:0%
um then they could hold them along for
 
01:43:03.109 --> 01:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
years without having a legitimate
 
01:43:04.950 --> 01:43:04.960 align:start position:0%
reason to be a permit holder
 
01:43:06.550 --> 01:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:43:08.550 --> 01:43:08.560 align:start position:0%
representative smith for a question
 
01:43:09.750 --> 01:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
01:43:11.669 --> 01:43:11.679 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
01:43:14.149 --> 01:43:14.159 align:start position:0%
you keep referring to the port authority
 
01:43:17.270 --> 01:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
and to coastline moorings
 
01:43:17.280 --> 01:43:18.229 align:start position:0%
and to coastline moorings
um

01:43:18.229 --> 01:43:18.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:18.239 --> 01:43:19.109 align:start position:0%
um
but

01:43:19.109 --> 01:43:19.119 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:43:23.510 --> 01:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
when i look at uh to rsa 270
 
01:43:23.520 --> 01:43:24.709 align:start position:0%
when i look at uh to rsa 270
it

01:43:24.709 --> 01:43:24.719 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:43:27.030 --> 01:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't make a difference it doesn't
 
01:43:29.590 --> 01:43:29.600 align:start position:0%
seem to differentiate between inland
 
01:43:32.390 --> 01:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
moorings and coastal moorings
 
01:43:35.590 --> 01:43:35.600 align:start position:0%
was your intent to just have this happen
 
01:43:38.310 --> 01:43:38.320 align:start position:0%
on the seacoast
 
01:43:40.070 --> 01:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative question yes my
 
01:43:42.870 --> 01:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
intent was as i spoke to earlier for it
 
01:43:44.870 --> 01:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
to be coastal moorings only
 
01:43:47.830 --> 01:43:47.840 align:start position:0%
because there's a distinction and i'd be
 
01:43:49.350 --> 01:43:49.360 align:start position:0%
glad to entertain an amendment that the
 
01:43:51.590 --> 01:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
committee might like to do to clarify
 
01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:52.629 align:start position:0%
committee might like to do to clarify
that

01:43:52.629 --> 01:43:52.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:43:52.639 --> 01:43:53.750 align:start position:0%
that
is

01:43:53.750 --> 01:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:43:53.760 --> 01:43:54.709 align:start position:0%
is
um

01:43:54.709 --> 01:43:54.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:56.790 --> 01:43:56.800 align:start position:0%
in inland bodies you don't have somebody
 
01:43:57.910 --> 01:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
who's going to take a boat and go away
 
01:44:00.229 --> 01:44:00.239 align:start position:0%
for two weeks on the on a local lake
 
01:44:02.550 --> 01:44:02.560 align:start position:0%
on the in the coastal environment that
 
01:44:04.830 --> 01:44:04.840 align:start position:0%
is more common
 
01:44:06.950 --> 01:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
therefore whatever never moorings don't
 
01:44:08.550 --> 01:44:08.560 align:start position:0%
have a boat on them during the summer
 
01:44:10.950 --> 01:44:10.960 align:start position:0%
that number is greater when people that
 
01:44:13.270 --> 01:44:13.280 align:start position:0%
bought their boat to use it
 
01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:14.790 align:start position:0%
bought their boat to use it
to

01:44:14.790 --> 01:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:44:16.790 --> 01:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
travel the coast
 
01:44:18.870 --> 01:44:18.880 align:start position:0%
um it'd be open more than it would be
 
01:44:18.880 --> 01:44:22.550 align:start position:0%
um it'd be open more than it would be
otherwise

01:44:22.550 --> 01:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:27.189 --> 01:44:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:29.430 --> 01:44:29.440 align:start position:0%
any any other
 
01:44:31.510 --> 01:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
representative vegan for a question
 
01:44:33.030 --> 01:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you
 
01:44:34.950 --> 01:44:34.960 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
01:44:34.960 --> 01:44:36.470 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
uh

01:44:36.470 --> 01:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:44:39.430 --> 01:44:39.440 align:start position:0%
not being a boat owner does the
 
01:44:40.870 --> 01:44:40.880 align:start position:0%
mooring permit
 
01:44:44.070 --> 01:44:44.080 align:start position:0%
have any language in it that requires
 
01:44:49.270 --> 01:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
the owner of the permit to
 
01:44:51.189 --> 01:44:51.199 align:start position:0%
compensate on any liability that might
 
01:44:53.750 --> 01:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
occur of damage and it's mooring if you
 
01:44:53.760 --> 01:44:55.830 align:start position:0%
occur of damage and it's mooring if you
know

01:44:55.830 --> 01:44:55.840 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:44:57.750 --> 01:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
no um
 
01:45:00.149 --> 01:45:00.159 align:start position:0%
and i'd have to we look at the um i
 
01:45:01.990 --> 01:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
don't currently hold a mooring in the
 
01:45:03.590 --> 01:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
state i am a boater
 
01:45:05.990 --> 01:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
um and so i don't recall if they if the
 
01:45:07.910 --> 01:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
port requires insurance or not some do
 
01:45:11.030 --> 01:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
some don't the
 
01:45:13.830 --> 01:45:13.840 align:start position:0%
the property that you
 
01:45:15.510 --> 01:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
again the real property
 
01:45:17.830 --> 01:45:17.840 align:start position:0%
at the mooring location is has is
 
01:45:19.510 --> 01:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
provided by
 
01:45:21.510 --> 01:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
the permit holder the state doesn't
 
01:45:22.870 --> 01:45:22.880 align:start position:0%
provide that therefore the state doesn't
 
01:45:24.870 --> 01:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
have any liability on that and any
 
01:45:26.390 --> 01:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
prudent voter knows that you should
 
01:45:28.149 --> 01:45:28.159 align:start position:0%
check your ground tackle and ensure that
 
01:45:30.149 --> 01:45:30.159 align:start position:0%
it's adequate to hold the boat because
 
01:45:31.109 --> 01:45:31.119 align:start position:0%
there is
 
01:45:33.990 --> 01:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
corrosion in um
 
01:45:39.189 --> 01:45:39.199 align:start position:0%
over time um chains weaken in in
 
01:45:40.550 --> 01:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
rust out so
 
01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:41.350 align:start position:0%
rust out so
um

01:45:41.350 --> 01:45:41.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:42.550 --> 01:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
that's really
 
01:45:44.790 --> 01:45:44.800 align:start position:0%
the responsibility of the permit holder
 
01:45:46.629 --> 01:45:46.639 align:start position:0%
and the boat owner to ensure that they
 
01:45:48.310 --> 01:45:48.320 align:start position:0%
have adequate
 
01:45:49.669 --> 01:45:49.679 align:start position:0%
you know system that's going to hold
 
01:45:49.679 --> 01:45:51.510 align:start position:0%
you know system that's going to hold
them

01:45:51.510 --> 01:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:45:51.520 --> 01:45:53.350 align:start position:0%
them
follow-up

01:45:53.350 --> 01:45:53.360 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:45:55.430 --> 01:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
actually my question is for the chair do
 
01:45:57.109 --> 01:45:57.119 align:start position:0%
we presume
 
01:45:59.270 --> 01:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
chief dunleavy will be testifying on
 
01:46:01.910 --> 01:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
this uh he will be testifying so i'll
 
01:46:03.910 --> 01:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
hold my question then for him thank you
 
01:46:07.030 --> 01:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
very much thank you mr chairman
 
01:46:11.109 --> 01:46:11.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:12.470 --> 01:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
01:46:13.750 --> 01:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
representative for taking the question
 
01:46:15.350 --> 01:46:15.360 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering who you envision is going
 
01:46:17.990 --> 01:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
to develop the permit process the form
 
01:46:19.910 --> 01:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
is it will be electronic and then who
 
01:46:22.149 --> 01:46:22.159 align:start position:0%
again will oversee the process as it
 
01:46:24.870 --> 01:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
unfolds um between the existing owner
 
01:46:27.510 --> 01:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
and the transferee
 
01:46:29.590 --> 01:46:29.600 align:start position:0%
okay so i don't envision there being a
 
01:46:32.550 --> 01:46:32.560 align:start position:0%
form i envision this being quite a quite
 
01:46:32.560 --> 01:46:33.510 align:start position:0%
form i envision this being quite a quite
simple

01:46:33.510 --> 01:46:33.520 align:start position:0%
simple
 
01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:34.629 align:start position:0%
simple
agreement

01:46:34.629 --> 01:46:34.639 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
01:46:34.639 --> 01:46:35.750 align:start position:0%
agreement
so

01:46:35.750 --> 01:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:46:37.669 --> 01:46:37.679 align:start position:0%
currently again on coastal moorings the
 
01:46:39.189 --> 01:46:39.199 align:start position:0%
port authority
 
01:46:41.030 --> 01:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
has a form you fill out as the permit
 
01:46:41.040 --> 01:46:42.229 align:start position:0%
has a form you fill out as the permit
holder

01:46:42.229 --> 01:46:42.239 align:start position:0%
holder
 
01:46:43.990 --> 01:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
and in the i'm pretty sure it's on the
 
01:46:45.430 --> 01:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
form but it's in the language if you go
 
01:46:46.950 --> 01:46:46.960 align:start position:0%
to the rsa that
 
01:46:49.270 --> 01:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
currently it's explicitly
 
01:46:50.950 --> 01:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
prohibited to
 
01:46:52.709 --> 01:46:52.719 align:start position:0%
allow somebody to use your mooring
 
01:46:55.830 --> 01:46:55.840 align:start position:0%
period so this again would be
 
01:46:58.070 --> 01:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
you as a permit holder would decide if
 
01:46:59.750 --> 01:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
somebody can use your mooring and who it
 
01:47:01.030 --> 01:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
is but it
 
01:47:02.550 --> 01:47:02.560 align:start position:0%
would not require
 
01:47:03.990 --> 01:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
additional paperwork or additional
 
01:47:06.950 --> 01:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:06.960 --> 01:47:11.669 align:start position:0%
 
welcome

01:47:11.669 --> 01:47:11.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:11.679 --> 01:47:12.870 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:47:12.870 --> 01:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:47:12.880 --> 01:47:14.390 align:start position:0%
representative
creighton

01:47:14.390 --> 01:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
creighton
 
01:47:16.550 --> 01:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman representative
 
01:47:18.790 --> 01:47:18.800 align:start position:0%
uh thank you and and
 
01:47:20.310 --> 01:47:20.320 align:start position:0%
you know clearly trying to make things
 
01:47:23.030 --> 01:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
easier to visit new hampshire makes
 
01:47:25.430 --> 01:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
sense um
 
01:47:27.270 --> 01:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
my question though is
 
01:47:28.470 --> 01:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
so you're
 
01:47:30.550 --> 01:47:30.560 align:start position:0%
what we're authorizing then is a bill
 
01:47:32.390 --> 01:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
that says
 
01:47:34.629 --> 01:47:34.639 align:start position:0%
that a bone owner that owns a mooring
 
01:47:37.189 --> 01:47:37.199 align:start position:0%
can have a handshake
 
01:47:39.590 --> 01:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
with someone to say hey come on use my
 
01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:40.790 align:start position:0%
with someone to say hey come on use my
mooring

01:47:40.790 --> 01:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
mooring
 
01:47:42.390 --> 01:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
if if i'm the
 
01:47:43.750 --> 01:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
port authority
 
01:47:45.750 --> 01:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
how do i know that that boat is changed
 
01:47:47.830 --> 01:47:47.840 align:start position:0%
if there's no coordination with the port
 
01:47:49.270 --> 01:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
authority paperwork or anything like
 
01:47:51.669 --> 01:47:51.679 align:start position:0%
that and so therefore how do i
 
01:47:53.430 --> 01:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
how do i know that that handshake has
 
01:47:53.440 --> 01:47:55.350 align:start position:0%
how do i know that that handshake has
occurred

01:47:55.350 --> 01:47:55.360 align:start position:0%
occurred
 
01:47:56.390 --> 01:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
01:47:56.400 --> 01:47:57.590 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
question

01:47:57.590 --> 01:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:47:59.350 --> 01:47:59.360 align:start position:0%
well again the port authority has the
 
01:48:01.910 --> 01:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
knowledge of who the permit holder is
 
01:48:01.920 --> 01:48:02.709 align:start position:0%
knowledge of who the permit holder is
and

01:48:02.709 --> 01:48:02.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:48:05.030 --> 01:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
the description length
 
01:48:07.590 --> 01:48:07.600 align:start position:0%
draft of the boat and so forth
 
01:48:09.270 --> 01:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
so the port authority
 
01:48:11.830 --> 01:48:11.840 align:start position:0%
could contact the permit holder
 
01:48:13.510 --> 01:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
if they were concerned that
 
01:48:14.870 --> 01:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
somebody was on that mooring that didn't
 
01:48:14.880 --> 01:48:15.590 align:start position:0%
somebody was on that mooring that didn't
have

01:48:15.590 --> 01:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:48:17.270 --> 01:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
the right to use it
 
01:48:19.350 --> 01:48:19.360 align:start position:0%
really what this does again it opens it
 
01:48:21.030 --> 01:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
up for the permit holder
 
01:48:23.590 --> 01:48:23.600 align:start position:0%
with pretty much very
 
01:48:25.270 --> 01:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
limited restrictions
 
01:48:28.790 --> 01:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
to use that mooring without um
 
01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:30.070 align:start position:0%
to use that mooring without um
so

01:48:30.070 --> 01:48:30.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:48:32.229 --> 01:48:32.239 align:start position:0%
i mean i guess
 
01:48:34.310 --> 01:48:34.320 align:start position:0%
probably the biggest question that
 
01:48:35.830 --> 01:48:35.840 align:start position:0%
may come to mind is well how do you know
 
01:48:37.270 --> 01:48:37.280 align:start position:0%
if the 30 days
 
01:48:39.990 --> 01:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
has been used up and again it's
 
01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:40.870 align:start position:0%
has been used up and again it's
um

01:48:40.870 --> 01:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:42.870 --> 01:48:42.880 align:start position:0%
something that if anybody's paying
 
01:48:44.149 --> 01:48:44.159 align:start position:0%
attention what boat's on there and they
 
01:48:45.189 --> 01:48:45.199 align:start position:0%
see one
 
01:48:46.950 --> 01:48:46.960 align:start position:0%
on there that's a different description
 
01:48:48.790 --> 01:48:48.800 align:start position:0%
than what the permit holder has
 
01:48:51.590 --> 01:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
for a long period of time that they can
 
01:48:53.990 --> 01:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
you know law enforcement could
 
01:48:56.149 --> 01:48:56.159 align:start position:0%
not take that boat it was there day
 
01:48:58.550 --> 01:48:58.560 align:start position:0%
after day after day again this is
 
01:49:01.030 --> 01:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
meant to be a temporary basis hence the
 
01:49:02.229 --> 01:49:02.239 align:start position:0%
30 days
 
01:49:04.709 --> 01:49:04.719 align:start position:0%
but i envisioned in reality that it'd
 
01:49:05.990 --> 01:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
probably be less than that a weekend
 
01:49:08.550 --> 01:49:08.560 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe three or four days and by
 
01:49:09.669 --> 01:49:09.679 align:start position:0%
the way this is something that does
 
01:49:12.470 --> 01:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
occur i'm a member of a boat actually
 
01:49:14.310 --> 01:49:14.320 align:start position:0%
sail club and this does occur throughout
 
01:49:14.320 --> 01:49:15.750 align:start position:0%
sail club and this does occur throughout
the

01:49:15.750 --> 01:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:49:19.669 --> 01:49:19.679 align:start position:0%
coast and and so it's done without any
 
01:49:21.750 --> 01:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
major problems the way i understand it
 
01:49:23.189 --> 01:49:23.199 align:start position:0%
because i've used moorings in other
 
01:49:25.030 --> 01:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
places that
 
01:49:26.629 --> 01:49:26.639 align:start position:0%
members of the club
 
01:49:29.109 --> 01:49:29.119 align:start position:0%
uh allowed what they do they put out the
 
01:49:30.709 --> 01:49:30.719 align:start position:0%
list and say i'm going to be gone again
 
01:49:32.310 --> 01:49:32.320 align:start position:0%
on this date for a week two weeks
 
01:49:34.229 --> 01:49:34.239 align:start position:0%
whatever it is if you want to use it
 
01:49:35.750 --> 01:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
you're welcome to use it
 
01:49:39.589 --> 01:49:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:43.830 --> 01:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:45.510 --> 01:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
representative post for a question thank
 
01:49:47.830 --> 01:49:47.840 align:start position:0%
you mr chair and thank you um
 
01:49:47.840 --> 01:49:49.030 align:start position:0%
you mr chair and thank you um
representative

01:49:49.030 --> 01:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:49:52.390 --> 01:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
um so i am looking at
 
01:49:54.830 --> 01:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
section 270
 
01:49:54.840 --> 01:49:56.390 align:start position:0%
section 270
67.

01:49:56.390 --> 01:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
67.
 
01:49:56.400 --> 01:49:57.750 align:start position:0%
67.
and

01:49:57.750 --> 01:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:49:59.910 --> 01:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
no mooring shall be sold or at least
 
01:50:03.830 --> 01:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
except as provided in this section
 
01:50:03.840 --> 01:50:05.350 align:start position:0%
except as provided in this section
so

01:50:05.350 --> 01:50:05.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:50:07.830 --> 01:50:07.840 align:start position:0%
this would affect
 
01:50:09.430 --> 01:50:09.440 align:start position:0%
this is where
 
01:50:11.830 --> 01:50:11.840 align:start position:0%
it would come to the attention of the
 
01:50:14.790 --> 01:50:14.800 align:start position:0%
port authority by changing this
 
01:50:18.310 --> 01:50:18.320 align:start position:0%
so they would know that
 
01:50:20.629 --> 01:50:20.639 align:start position:0%
owners of these moorings now have the
 
01:50:22.830 --> 01:50:22.840 align:start position:0%
ability to have someone there and maybe
 
01:50:25.270 --> 01:50:25.280 align:start position:0%
not um
 
01:50:28.310 --> 01:50:28.320 align:start position:0%
you know check these moorings regularly
 
01:50:30.310 --> 01:50:30.320 align:start position:0%
because now they know that that these
 
01:50:32.229 --> 01:50:32.239 align:start position:0%
folks have
 
01:50:35.510 --> 01:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:36.790 --> 01:50:36.800 align:start position:0%
in essence
 
01:50:38.390 --> 01:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
lease for free
 
01:50:40.310 --> 01:50:40.320 align:start position:0%
their spot
 
01:50:41.669 --> 01:50:41.679 align:start position:0%
is that correct thank you for the
 
01:50:43.589 --> 01:50:43.599 align:start position:0%
question and i would believe yes that's
 
01:50:45.030 --> 01:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
true and again if you look at the
 
01:50:47.189 --> 01:50:47.199 align:start position:0%
language what this does is it
 
01:50:47.199 --> 01:50:48.709 align:start position:0%
language what this does is it
it

01:50:48.709 --> 01:50:48.719 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:50:50.790 --> 01:50:50.800 align:start position:0%
under line one through two transfer
 
01:50:53.270 --> 01:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
mooring permits rsa 270
 
01:50:55.350 --> 01:50:55.360 align:start position:0%
colon 63 is repealed and reenacted to
 
01:50:59.750 --> 01:50:59.760 align:start position:0%

270 63 transfer of mooring permits one a
 
01:51:04.070 --> 01:51:04.080 align:start position:0%

01:51:08.070 --> 01:51:08.080 align:start position:0%

transfer such permit to a different
 
01:51:12.470 --> 01:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
person for use for up to 30 days so that
 
01:51:14.870 --> 01:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
that's the authority to do this that
 
01:51:16.870 --> 01:51:16.880 align:start position:0%
where it's um
 
01:51:19.030 --> 01:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
the language in lines one through
 
01:51:25.910 --> 01:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:25.920 --> 01:51:29.750 align:start position:0%
 
well

01:51:29.750 --> 01:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:31.109 --> 01:51:31.119 align:start position:0%
representative mayville and
 
01:51:33.109 --> 01:51:33.119 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
01:51:34.229 --> 01:51:34.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
01:51:36.070 --> 01:51:36.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:51:38.629 --> 01:51:38.639 align:start position:0%
i know nothing about these moorings
 
01:51:40.229 --> 01:51:40.239 align:start position:0%
but i know a little bit about boats and
 
01:51:42.229 --> 01:51:42.239 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if there's some limitation
 
01:51:44.790 --> 01:51:44.800 align:start position:0%
on the draft the draw the breath the the
 
01:51:46.550 --> 01:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
size of the boat that would exist in a
 
01:51:49.430 --> 01:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
mooring and if that could be potentially
 
01:51:50.790 --> 01:51:50.800 align:start position:0%
i mean i think this sounds like a good
 
01:51:52.950 --> 01:51:52.960 align:start position:0%
idea but would that be a complication if
 
01:51:54.550 --> 01:51:54.560 align:start position:0%
you know i've got my little baby yacht
 
01:51:55.910 --> 01:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
right here and someone comes in the
 
01:51:58.790 --> 01:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
50-foot one next door and
 
01:52:00.790 --> 01:52:00.800 align:start position:0%
is there some restriction on the what
 
01:52:02.149 --> 01:52:02.159 align:start position:0%
goes into the mooring and that's why
 
01:52:04.470 --> 01:52:04.480 align:start position:0%
there are these permits
 
01:52:05.589 --> 01:52:05.599 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
01:52:08.070 --> 01:52:08.080 align:start position:0%
question the reason for permits is to
 
01:52:08.950 --> 01:52:08.960 align:start position:0%
have an
 
01:52:08.960 --> 01:52:11.270 align:start position:0%
have an
orderly

01:52:11.270 --> 01:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
orderly
 
01:52:13.589 --> 01:52:13.599 align:start position:0%
process to make sure moorings are placed
 
01:52:15.189 --> 01:52:15.199 align:start position:0%
in an area where
 
01:52:17.030 --> 01:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
boats that are in the same moon field
 
01:52:17.040 --> 01:52:17.830 align:start position:0%
boats that are in the same moon field
don't

01:52:17.830 --> 01:52:17.840 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:52:19.589 --> 01:52:19.599 align:start position:0%
interfere with each other when there's a
 
01:52:20.870 --> 01:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
title change
 
01:52:22.550 --> 01:52:22.560 align:start position:0%
in indoor wind
 
01:52:24.709 --> 01:52:24.719 align:start position:0%
shift where there's enough what we call
 
01:52:25.910 --> 01:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
swing room
 
01:52:28.310 --> 01:52:28.320 align:start position:0%
that boats won't hit other boats in to
 
01:52:29.830 --> 01:52:29.840 align:start position:0%
your question
 
01:52:32.790 --> 01:52:32.800 align:start position:0%
yes some moorings have in the port
 
01:52:35.589 --> 01:52:35.599 align:start position:0%
ask for this information on the
 
01:52:35.599 --> 01:52:36.870 align:start position:0%
ask for this information on the
application

01:52:36.870 --> 01:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
application
 
01:52:38.229 --> 01:52:38.239 align:start position:0%
the length of your boat and the dr in
 
01:52:39.750 --> 01:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
the draft and so forth so when they
 
01:52:43.270 --> 01:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
issue you a permit when you come up
 
01:52:45.510 --> 01:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
on getting a location
 
01:52:48.390 --> 01:52:48.400 align:start position:0%
that they issue you one that
 
01:52:50.629 --> 01:52:50.639 align:start position:0%
has a the appropriate room so having
 
01:52:51.990 --> 01:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
said that
 
01:52:55.910 --> 01:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
you as a permit holder will obviously
 
01:52:57.589 --> 01:52:57.599 align:start position:0%
you know relay that information anybody
 
01:52:59.750 --> 01:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
that you let use it
 
01:53:02.310 --> 01:53:02.320 align:start position:0%
and a prudent mariner is going to ensure
 
01:53:02.320 --> 01:53:03.430 align:start position:0%
and a prudent mariner is going to ensure
that

01:53:03.430 --> 01:53:03.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:53:03.440 --> 01:53:04.550 align:start position:0%
that
they

01:53:04.550 --> 01:53:04.560 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:53:07.109 --> 01:53:07.119 align:start position:0%
don't put their boat in harm's way and
 
01:53:07.119 --> 01:53:07.910 align:start position:0%
don't put their boat in harm's way and
so

01:53:07.910 --> 01:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:53:09.669 --> 01:53:09.679 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's obvious sometimes it's
 
01:53:10.550 --> 01:53:10.560 align:start position:0%
not but
 
01:53:12.310 --> 01:53:12.320 align:start position:0%
again to clarify there are some warnings
 
01:53:14.390 --> 01:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
that the swing room would only allow say
 
01:53:16.390 --> 01:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
a 25-foot boat or 30-foot boat others
 
01:53:18.390 --> 01:53:18.400 align:start position:0%
that would allow a 50-foot boat
 
01:53:19.669 --> 01:53:19.679 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire most of those mooring
 
01:53:21.270 --> 01:53:21.280 align:start position:0%
fields now once you get over 40 feet
 
01:53:23.270 --> 01:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
they're getting restricted it's harder
 
01:53:25.030 --> 01:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
it's less and less of those to
 
01:53:26.390 --> 01:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
to have the
 
01:53:33.430 --> 01:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:36.629 --> 01:53:36.639 align:start position:0%
anyone else for and any other members of
 
01:53:38.070 --> 01:53:38.080 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:53:41.270 --> 01:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
for a question
 
01:53:43.189 --> 01:53:43.199 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
01:53:44.790 --> 01:53:44.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you mr chair i
 
01:53:46.149 --> 01:53:46.159 align:start position:0%
didn't believe i didn't realize there
 
01:53:47.750 --> 01:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
was going to be so much interest in the
 
01:53:50.229 --> 01:53:50.239 align:start position:0%
in the bill i appreciate it
 
01:53:51.669 --> 01:53:51.679 align:start position:0%
there wasn't a lot happening in the
 
01:53:53.589 --> 01:53:53.599 align:start position:0%
other one so they just got it all backed
 
01:53:53.599 --> 01:53:55.189 align:start position:0%
other one so they just got it all backed
up

01:53:55.189 --> 01:53:55.199 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:53:58.870 --> 01:53:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:00.709 --> 01:54:00.719 align:start position:0%
the chair calls uh
 
01:54:13.109 --> 01:54:13.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:14.629 --> 01:54:14.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman tim dunleavy i'm
 
01:54:15.910 --> 01:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
captain with the marine patrol for the
 
01:54:17.510 --> 01:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
division of state police
 
01:54:19.830 --> 01:54:19.840 align:start position:0%
and uh i was going to ask to
 
01:54:23.430 --> 01:54:23.440 align:start position:0%
respectfully withdraw my card as
 
01:54:25.990 --> 01:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
i learned just before this hearing
 
01:54:28.149 --> 01:54:28.159 align:start position:0%
that this applied to coastal moorings
 
01:54:30.229 --> 01:54:30.239 align:start position:0%
only and the department of safety marine
 
01:54:33.189 --> 01:54:33.199 align:start position:0%
patrol have no jurisdiction uh over the
 
01:54:35.109 --> 01:54:35.119 align:start position:0%
coastal moorings that is the the
 
01:54:36.790 --> 01:54:36.800 align:start position:0%
oversight of the new hampshire port
 
01:54:36.800 --> 01:54:37.830 align:start position:0%
oversight of the new hampshire port
authority

01:54:37.830 --> 01:54:37.840 align:start position:0%
authority
 
01:54:40.470 --> 01:54:40.480 align:start position:0%
uh i will and do express a bit of
 
01:54:43.830 --> 01:54:43.840 align:start position:0%
concern where this cites uh chapter 270
 
01:54:45.750 --> 01:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
where that chapter does specifically
 
01:54:47.510 --> 01:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
address inland moorings and it doesn't
 
01:54:49.189 --> 01:54:49.199 align:start position:0%
seem to be clear
 
01:54:52.470 --> 01:54:52.480 align:start position:0%
and and as representative connors uh
 
01:54:53.510 --> 01:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned in her question to
 
01:54:55.510 --> 01:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
representative trojan or maybe it was
 
01:54:57.109 --> 01:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
his representative post
 
01:54:59.109 --> 01:54:59.119 align:start position:0%
in speaking to the transfer the charging
 
01:55:00.950 --> 01:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
and leasing of moorings
 
01:55:03.350 --> 01:55:03.360 align:start position:0%
those statutes do not apply to the
 
01:55:05.189 --> 01:55:05.199 align:start position:0%
coastal moorings it's a whole separate
 
01:55:05.199 --> 01:55:06.470 align:start position:0%
coastal moorings it's a whole separate
oversight

01:55:06.470 --> 01:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
01:55:08.310 --> 01:55:08.320 align:start position:0%
and whether it's by rule or statute i
 
01:55:10.149 --> 01:55:10.159 align:start position:0%
can't speak to that
 
01:55:12.070 --> 01:55:12.080 align:start position:0%
but certainly
 
01:55:13.990 --> 01:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
department of safety would have concern
 
01:55:15.830 --> 01:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
if some of this language found its way
 
01:55:18.310 --> 01:55:18.320 align:start position:0%
into chapter 270 and applied to inland
 
01:55:21.030 --> 01:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
moorings so uh while i recognize
 
01:55:23.109 --> 01:55:23.119 align:start position:0%
representative teroshan's request for
 
01:55:25.510 --> 01:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
coastal application makes complete sense
 
01:55:26.310 --> 01:55:26.320 align:start position:0%
to me
 
01:55:28.470 --> 01:55:28.480 align:start position:0%
but i just don't know uh the ins and
 
01:55:31.430 --> 01:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
outs of the regulations down there
 
01:55:32.950 --> 01:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions if you
 
01:55:35.750 --> 01:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:38.070 --> 01:55:38.080 align:start position:0%
representative smith for a question
 
01:55:39.589 --> 01:55:39.599 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you thank
 
01:55:42.470 --> 01:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
you captain dunleavy so as the bill is
 
01:55:45.910 --> 01:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
written it is not
 
01:55:49.430 --> 01:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
doing what the sponsor wants it to do
 
01:55:52.229 --> 01:55:52.239 align:start position:0%
by addressing the statute the 270
 
01:55:52.239 --> 01:55:53.669 align:start position:0%
by addressing the statute the 270
statute

01:55:53.669 --> 01:55:53.679 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:55:56.070 --> 01:55:56.080 align:start position:0%
which is inland waterways
 
01:55:57.589 --> 01:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
01:55:59.830 --> 01:55:59.840 align:start position:0%
i do not know where the authority and
 
01:56:01.910 --> 01:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
the regulations for the coastal moorings
 
01:56:04.550 --> 01:56:04.560 align:start position:0%
are whether it's by rule or statue
 
01:56:07.109 --> 01:56:07.119 align:start position:0%
uh what i do know is is 270 would apply
 
01:56:09.430 --> 01:56:09.440 align:start position:0%
to inland moorings and i and i after a
 
01:56:11.430 --> 01:56:11.440 align:start position:0%
discussion with him it's obviously not
 
01:56:13.990 --> 01:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
his intent and so that's why i would
 
01:56:16.629 --> 01:56:16.639 align:start position:0%
have no no opinion department station
 
01:56:18.550 --> 01:56:18.560 align:start position:0%
would remain neutral other than we would
 
01:56:20.950 --> 01:56:20.960 align:start position:0%
have concern if that type of language
 
01:56:23.830 --> 01:56:23.840 align:start position:0%
showed up without clarification in the
 
01:56:25.350 --> 01:56:25.360 align:start position:0%
270 chapter
 
01:56:29.830 --> 01:56:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:31.910 --> 01:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
yeah any other questions by members of
 
01:56:34.310 --> 01:56:34.320 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:56:37.510 --> 01:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
representative post for a question
 
01:56:39.030 --> 01:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
where would someone go to find that
 
01:56:39.040 --> 01:56:40.870 align:start position:0%
where would someone go to find that
information

01:56:40.870 --> 01:56:40.880 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:56:43.510 --> 01:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
to make to perhaps make an amendment
 
01:56:45.109 --> 01:56:45.119 align:start position:0%
to that
 
01:56:46.070 --> 01:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for your
 
01:56:47.430 --> 01:56:47.440 align:start position:0%
question i would contact the port
 
01:56:49.750 --> 01:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
authority uh i suspect that had they
 
01:56:51.669 --> 01:56:51.679 align:start position:0%
been here today they could shed more
 
01:56:53.750 --> 01:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
light on on all this issue
 
01:56:53.760 --> 01:56:54.870 align:start position:0%
light on on all this issue
um

01:56:54.870 --> 01:56:54.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:56.390 --> 01:56:56.400 align:start position:0%

moorings
 
01:57:18.390 --> 01:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
does a permit holder have when they get
 
01:57:21.030 --> 01:57:21.040 align:start position:0%
a permit have liability
 
01:57:21.040 --> 01:57:21.990 align:start position:0%

their
 
01:57:29.350 --> 01:57:29.360 align:start position:0%
boat as it relates to when they apply
 
01:57:31.270 --> 01:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
for the permit or a condition of getting
 
01:57:33.189 --> 01:57:33.199 align:start position:0%
a permit
 
01:57:33.990 --> 01:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
01:57:35.510 --> 01:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
representative uh no there is no
 
01:57:38.470 --> 01:57:38.480 align:start position:0%
insurance requirement uh for
 
01:57:41.589 --> 01:57:41.599 align:start position:0%
boats or boats on moorings or moorings
 
01:57:44.229 --> 01:57:44.239 align:start position:0%
but certainly we have been
 
01:57:46.149 --> 01:57:46.159 align:start position:0%
requested to provide reports
 
01:57:47.910 --> 01:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
after moorings breakaway boats break
 
01:57:47.920 --> 01:57:49.030 align:start position:0%
after moorings breakaway boats break
away

01:57:49.030 --> 01:57:49.040 align:start position:0%
away
 
01:57:51.350 --> 01:57:51.360 align:start position:0%
for civil action
 
01:57:52.950 --> 01:57:52.960 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up
 
01:57:54.229 --> 01:57:54.239 align:start position:0%
so follow-up
 
01:57:57.109 --> 01:57:57.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:58.870 --> 01:57:58.880 align:start position:0%

01:58:05.109 --> 01:58:05.119 align:start position:0%
ill-tied up boat does cause damage to a
 
01:58:07.030 --> 01:58:07.040 align:start position:0%
mooring area or to a
 
01:58:07.040 --> 01:58:08.709 align:start position:0%
mooring area or to a
inland

01:58:08.709 --> 01:58:08.719 align:start position:0%
inland
 
01:58:10.629 --> 01:58:10.639 align:start position:0%
dock area who
 
01:58:12.229 --> 01:58:12.239 align:start position:0%
is responsible for that is there
 
01:58:14.229 --> 01:58:14.239 align:start position:0%
language in the permit about any kind of
 
01:58:14.239 --> 01:58:16.629 align:start position:0%
language in the permit about any kind of
responsibility

01:58:16.629 --> 01:58:16.639 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
01:58:18.629 --> 01:58:18.639 align:start position:0%
there is not
 
01:58:18.639 --> 01:58:19.350 align:start position:0%
there is not
the

01:58:19.350 --> 01:58:19.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:58:21.189 --> 01:58:21.199 align:start position:0%
and it does happen particularly with
 
01:58:23.270 --> 01:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
someone who is negligent in checking the
 
01:58:24.470 --> 01:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
condition of their tackle as
 
01:58:26.310 --> 01:58:26.320 align:start position:0%
representative terosha mentioned
 
01:58:28.550 --> 01:58:28.560 align:start position:0%
and we're tested every year two or three
 
01:58:29.669 --> 01:58:29.679 align:start position:0%
times a year
 
01:58:31.109 --> 01:58:31.119 align:start position:0%
after a front comes through and we get a
 
01:58:33.350 --> 01:58:33.360 align:start position:0%
real choppy day on our big lakes some of
 
01:58:35.030 --> 01:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
those we can chains break away and the
 
01:58:36.709 --> 01:58:36.719 align:start position:0%
boats go down the lake and cause damage
 
01:58:38.310 --> 01:58:38.320 align:start position:0%
when they reach the shoreline
 
01:58:40.870 --> 01:58:40.880 align:start position:0%
it's a civil matter with no requirements
 
01:58:44.709 --> 01:58:44.719 align:start position:0%

02:20:06.389 --> 02:20:06.399 align:start position:0%
uh you need ten minutes to speak uh
 
02:20:07.910 --> 02:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
that's kinda
 
02:20:11.990 --> 02:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
yes sir all right well uh if that okay
 
02:20:14.710 --> 02:20:14.720 align:start position:0%
uh good morning mr chair and members of
 
02:20:16.389 --> 02:20:16.399 align:start position:0%
this fine committee
 
02:20:18.469 --> 02:20:18.479 align:start position:0%
my name is douglas trottia i'm a
 
02:20:20.870 --> 02:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
representative of district six
 
02:20:23.510 --> 02:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
serving the town of belmont
 
02:20:25.510 --> 02:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
this issue was not on my radar until it
 
02:20:27.670 --> 02:20:27.680 align:start position:0%
was brought up by my town administrator
 
02:20:30.469 --> 02:20:30.479 align:start position:0%
border slutman and a few constituents
 
02:20:32.309 --> 02:20:32.319 align:start position:0%
in my community
 
02:20:32.319 --> 02:20:33.190 align:start position:0%
in my community
so

02:20:33.190 --> 02:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:20:34.230 --> 02:20:34.240 align:start position:0%
what we're
 
02:20:36.630 --> 02:20:36.640 align:start position:0%
with this bill what i'm trying to do
 
02:20:36.640 --> 02:20:37.990 align:start position:0%
with this bill what i'm trying to do
is

02:20:37.990 --> 02:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:20:39.990 --> 02:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
where boats right now are only being
 
02:20:41.910 --> 02:20:41.920 align:start position:0%
registered by the foot
 
02:20:45.910 --> 02:20:45.920 align:start position:0%
not the value of the boat at the time
 
02:20:45.920 --> 02:20:46.950 align:start position:0%
not the value of the boat at the time
as

02:20:46.950 --> 02:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
as
 
02:20:49.510 --> 02:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
most ivs or campers are it's not by the
 
02:20:51.349 --> 02:20:51.359 align:start position:0%
foot it is by
 
02:20:52.550 --> 02:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
the value
 
02:20:54.550 --> 02:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
so my border seletman and town
 
02:20:57.190 --> 02:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
administrator asked me if i could enter
 
02:20:58.389 --> 02:20:58.399 align:start position:0%
a bill
 
02:21:01.510 --> 02:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:01.520 --> 02:21:02.389 align:start position:0%
 
have

02:21:02.389 --> 02:21:02.399 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:21:05.670 --> 02:21:05.680 align:start position:0%
boats on the same level as ivs for
 
02:21:10.230 --> 02:21:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:13.670 --> 02:21:13.680 align:start position:0%
registered at their value not the foot
 
02:21:15.190 --> 02:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
because you could have a two or three
 
02:21:17.110 --> 02:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollar vote
 
02:21:19.349 --> 02:21:19.359 align:start position:0%
that you're paying a minimal amount to
 
02:21:21.750 --> 02:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
register it whereas if you buy a camper
 
02:21:23.349 --> 02:21:23.359 align:start position:0%
at the same um
 
02:21:25.270 --> 02:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
value you're probably paying thousands
 
02:21:27.030 --> 02:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
of dollars to register it here in the
 
02:21:27.040 --> 02:21:28.230 align:start position:0%
of dollars to register it here in the
state

02:21:28.230 --> 02:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:21:31.429 --> 02:21:31.439 align:start position:0%
so basically that's it i have spoken to
 
02:21:33.990 --> 02:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
members of the boating association i
 
02:21:35.990 --> 02:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
believe it is and even
 
02:21:38.070 --> 02:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
marine patrol
 
02:21:39.190 --> 02:21:39.200 align:start position:0%
and they understand what i'm trying to
 
02:21:41.910 --> 02:21:41.920 align:start position:0%
do we feel that there could be some work
 
02:21:45.110 --> 02:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
on this and i have no problem if we
 
02:21:46.790 --> 02:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
could set up a committee and work with
 
02:21:48.309 --> 02:21:48.319 align:start position:0%
them and come up with something that's
 
02:21:51.190 --> 02:21:51.200 align:start position:0%
feasible for everyone
 
02:21:54.230 --> 02:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
so that's pretty much my testimony if
 
02:21:56.230 --> 02:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
anybody's got any questions i will try
 
02:22:01.990 --> 02:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:03.750 --> 02:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
representative post uh followed by
 
02:22:06.150 --> 02:22:06.160 align:start position:0%
representative connor
 
02:22:08.309 --> 02:22:08.319 align:start position:0%
thank you when you're registering a
 
02:22:10.469 --> 02:22:10.479 align:start position:0%
vehicle um
 
02:22:13.429 --> 02:22:13.439 align:start position:0%
in this state we have anything before
 
02:22:13.439 --> 02:22:15.110 align:start position:0%
in this state we have anything before
2000

02:22:15.110 --> 02:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
2000
 
02:22:18.550 --> 02:22:18.560 align:start position:0%
is vastly reduced would that be part of
 
02:22:18.560 --> 02:22:19.590 align:start position:0%
is vastly reduced would that be part of
this

02:22:19.590 --> 02:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:22:24.389 --> 02:22:24.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:24.399 --> 02:22:26.630 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:22:26.630 --> 02:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:22:27.830 --> 02:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
02:22:29.429 --> 02:22:29.439 align:start position:0%
taking my question who would determine
 
02:22:31.590 --> 02:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
the value of the boats and does it
 
02:22:34.630 --> 02:22:34.640 align:start position:0%
depend on engines and all kinds of other
 
02:22:37.190 --> 02:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
pieces um i believe it would be the same
 
02:22:41.190 --> 02:22:41.200 align:start position:0%
way as a vehicle they'll look at the
 
02:22:43.110 --> 02:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
purchase or the value of the vehicle at
 
02:22:45.110 --> 02:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
the time that there would be a book
 
02:22:47.429 --> 02:22:47.439 align:start position:0%
um and then determined that way and
 
02:22:49.990 --> 02:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
depreciation probably like a normal
 
02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:51.270 align:start position:0%
depreciation probably like a normal
vehicle

02:22:51.270 --> 02:22:51.280 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
02:22:59.030 --> 02:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:04.309 --> 02:23:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:06.630 --> 02:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
02:23:08.389 --> 02:23:08.399 align:start position:0%
thank you very much that was a fast 10
 
02:23:17.349 --> 02:23:17.359 align:start position:0%

representing the

dmv i presume that's the department of
 
02:23:27.270 --> 02:23:27.280 align:start position:0%
motor vehicles
 
02:23:29.670 --> 02:23:29.680 align:start position:0%
department vision okay
 
02:23:33.429 --> 02:23:33.439 align:start position:0%
i upgraded it all right downgrade sorry
 
02:23:34.950 --> 02:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman and members of
 
02:23:36.630 --> 02:23:36.640 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is
 
02:23:39.110 --> 02:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
jeff overdank and i'm here to
 
02:23:40.950 --> 02:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
provide testimony today in opposition to
 
02:23:43.030 --> 02:23:43.040 align:start position:0%
this bill and not because we don't
 
02:23:45.030 --> 02:23:45.040 align:start position:0%
believe the mill rate system doesn't
 
02:23:47.910 --> 02:23:47.920 align:start position:0%
work we've registered some 1.6 million
 
02:23:47.920 --> 02:23:49.270 align:start position:0%
work we've registered some 1.6 million
vehicles

02:23:49.270 --> 02:23:49.280 align:start position:0%
vehicles
 
02:23:52.230 --> 02:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
via the mill rate system last year
 
02:23:54.389 --> 02:23:54.399 align:start position:0%
the issue becomes at where the mill rate
 
02:23:57.670 --> 02:23:57.680 align:start position:0%
comes in for boats and starting at a
 
02:23:59.429 --> 02:23:59.439 align:start position:0%
mill rate of 18
 
02:24:03.110 --> 02:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:04.870 --> 02:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
pastime for folks i mean i think one of
 
02:24:06.389 --> 02:24:06.399 align:start position:0%
the things that makes it
 
02:24:08.070 --> 02:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire a great landing spot for
 
02:24:09.750 --> 02:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
boating is that it is
 
02:24:11.750 --> 02:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
a reasonable rate in which to register
 
02:24:12.710 --> 02:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
your boat
 
02:24:15.590 --> 02:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
and for some historical purpose here
 
02:24:19.990 --> 02:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
in 2019 we registered some 95 000 boats
 
02:24:23.830 --> 02:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
in 2020 we registered a record 103 000
 
02:24:23.840 --> 02:24:24.950 align:start position:0%
in 2020 we registered a record 103 000
votes

02:24:24.950 --> 02:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
votes
 
02:24:24.960 --> 02:24:25.910 align:start position:0%
votes
and

02:24:25.910 --> 02:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:24:28.150 --> 02:24:28.160 align:start position:0%
last year in 2021 we eclipsed that with
 
02:24:30.389 --> 02:24:30.399 align:start position:0%
107 000
 
02:24:32.150 --> 02:24:32.160 align:start position:0%
boat registrations
 
02:24:34.389 --> 02:24:34.399 align:start position:0%
and we are seeing a number of folks from
 
02:24:36.309 --> 02:24:36.319 align:start position:0%
other states registering their boats and
 
02:24:38.950 --> 02:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
using them here in new hampshire because
 
02:24:40.550 --> 02:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
number one it's a great place to be but
 
02:24:42.389 --> 02:24:42.399 align:start position:0%
it is a value to register your boat
 
02:24:44.950 --> 02:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
under the current system
 
02:24:44.960 --> 02:24:45.750 align:start position:0%
under the current system
uh

02:24:45.750 --> 02:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:24:47.429 --> 02:24:47.439 align:start position:0%
having said that when people register
 
02:24:48.950 --> 02:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
their boats and they travel here to use
 
02:24:51.270 --> 02:24:51.280 align:start position:0%
them it's they're they're purchasing gas
 
02:24:53.429 --> 02:24:53.439 align:start position:0%
here they're stopping at our restaurants
 
02:24:55.270 --> 02:24:55.280 align:start position:0%
they're staying in the hotels
 
02:24:58.230 --> 02:24:58.240 align:start position:0%
and bringing the mill rate up as high as
 
02:25:00.230 --> 02:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
this bill calls will
 
02:25:01.670 --> 02:25:01.680 align:start position:0%
absolutely cut the number of
 
02:25:03.990 --> 02:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
registrations uh drastically in our
 
02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:05.349 align:start position:0%
registrations uh drastically in our
estimation

02:25:05.349 --> 02:25:05.359 align:start position:0%
estimation
 
02:25:06.870 --> 02:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
that's something that we have seen over
 
02:25:09.110 --> 02:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
the past few years people are taking
 
02:25:10.389 --> 02:25:10.399 align:start position:0%
advantage of
 
02:25:12.790 --> 02:25:12.800 align:start position:0%
a boating in a great place and doing so
 
02:25:14.710 --> 02:25:14.720 align:start position:0%
where it's affordable and we think this
 
02:25:14.720 --> 02:25:15.590 align:start position:0%
where it's affordable and we think this
bill

02:25:15.590 --> 02:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:25:18.950 --> 02:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
backs that sends that backwards
 
02:25:20.790 --> 02:25:20.800 align:start position:0%
having said that i know there was a
 
02:25:22.150 --> 02:25:22.160 align:start position:0%
question earlier
 
02:25:24.870 --> 02:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
reference how is the value determined
 
02:25:26.230 --> 02:25:26.240 align:start position:0%
and value is determined through
 
02:25:28.469 --> 02:25:28.479 align:start position:0%
administrative rule it is using the red
 
02:25:28.479 --> 02:25:29.910 align:start position:0%
administrative rule it is using the red
book

02:25:29.910 --> 02:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
book
 
02:25:31.429 --> 02:25:31.439 align:start position:0%
same thing as a kelly blue book there
 
02:25:32.950 --> 02:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
are a couple of reference guides out
 
02:25:34.550 --> 02:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
there and
 
02:25:36.230 --> 02:25:36.240 align:start position:0%
having checked or researching the bill
 
02:25:38.550 --> 02:25:38.560 align:start position:0%
red book does determine
 
02:25:39.830 --> 02:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
the value
 
02:25:42.469 --> 02:25:42.479 align:start position:0%
of boats as well
 
02:25:43.910 --> 02:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
having said that i'll conclude my
 
02:25:46.309 --> 02:25:46.319 align:start position:0%
testimony and answer any questions
 
02:25:48.230 --> 02:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
from the committee that you may have
 
02:25:48.240 --> 02:25:52.230 align:start position:0%
from the committee that you may have
okay

02:25:52.230 --> 02:25:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:54.710 --> 02:25:54.720 align:start position:0%

taking my question
um

02:25:59.110 --> 02:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:01.030 --> 02:26:01.040 align:start position:0%
can you give me
 
02:26:03.510 --> 02:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
just a couple of examples of what the
 
02:26:05.590 --> 02:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
price difference would be on a couple of
 
02:26:07.349 --> 02:26:07.359 align:start position:0%
boats if you had a boat that you
 
02:26:09.190 --> 02:26:09.200 align:start position:0%
purchased for a hundred thousand dollars
 
02:26:10.870 --> 02:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
and it's new
 
02:26:13.510 --> 02:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
what they would pay now or versus what
 
02:26:16.389 --> 02:26:16.399 align:start position:0%
they would pay by the 18 mil rate
 
02:26:18.150 --> 02:26:18.160 align:start position:0%
sure there's actually not to steal the
 
02:26:20.710 --> 02:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
testimony from the association coming up
 
02:26:22.230 --> 02:26:22.240 align:start position:0%
next they have some of those examples
 
02:26:25.590 --> 02:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:27.510 --> 02:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
okay so you'll defer to them we'll defer
 
02:26:30.550 --> 02:26:30.560 align:start position:0%

beauty of the new hampshire's resources

members from the seacoast to

connecticut river
 
02:28:56.790 --> 02:28:56.800 align:start position:0%
i'm here to testify on behalf of the
 
02:29:00.950 --> 02:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
association in opposition to hb 1641
 
02:29:03.670 --> 02:29:03.680 align:start position:0%
relative to vessel registration
 
02:29:06.389 --> 02:29:06.399 align:start position:0%
our group believes that hp 1641 will
 
02:29:08.550 --> 02:29:08.560 align:start position:0%
have a negative impact on recreational
 
02:29:10.309 --> 02:29:10.319 align:start position:0%
boating in new hampshire
 
02:29:12.550 --> 02:29:12.560 align:start position:0%
as what is proposed is a major change to
 
02:29:14.950 --> 02:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
the formula for registration and it is a
 
02:29:17.030 --> 02:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
significant increase in the cost of
 
02:29:19.670 --> 02:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
registration to the consumer ultimately
 
02:29:21.510 --> 02:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
our customer
 
02:29:23.830 --> 02:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
specific concerns that we have from our
 
02:29:23.840 --> 02:29:25.670 align:start position:0%
specific concerns that we have from our
membership

02:29:25.670 --> 02:29:25.680 align:start position:0%
membership
 
02:29:28.389 --> 02:29:28.399 align:start position:0%
concern number one is the impact on new
 
02:29:30.309 --> 02:29:30.319 align:start position:0%
hampshire families decision to choose
 
02:29:33.670 --> 02:29:33.680 align:start position:0%
boating as an activity in the summer
 
02:29:35.349 --> 02:29:35.359 align:start position:0%
families have a lot of choices when it
 
02:29:37.670 --> 02:29:37.680 align:start position:0%
comes to recreating in our state this
 
02:29:39.990 --> 02:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
appears to raise fees significantly
 
02:29:42.630 --> 02:29:42.640 align:start position:0%
without any clear direction of whether
 
02:29:44.790 --> 02:29:44.800 align:start position:0%
the increase is needed and how the
 
02:29:46.950 --> 02:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
monies would be spent
 
02:29:48.550 --> 02:29:48.560 align:start position:0%
while this could be a short-term
 
02:29:50.870 --> 02:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
increase in funding for the state
 
02:29:52.550 --> 02:29:52.560 align:start position:0%
our group believes this could end up
 
02:29:54.469 --> 02:29:54.479 align:start position:0%
hurting recreational voting in the long
 
02:29:54.479 --> 02:29:55.990 align:start position:0%
hurting recreational voting in the long
term

02:29:55.990 --> 02:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
term
 
02:29:57.190 --> 02:29:57.200 align:start position:0%
number two
 
02:29:59.110 --> 02:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
concern of impact
 
02:30:01.190 --> 02:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
for voters that come to us from out of
 
02:30:03.990 --> 02:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
state that register here it's not clear
 
02:30:06.710 --> 02:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
if the increases in fees will cause some
 
02:30:08.550 --> 02:30:08.560 align:start position:0%
of the out-of-state boaters who
 
02:30:10.630 --> 02:30:10.640 align:start position:0%
currently register register their boats
 
02:30:12.950 --> 02:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire to change their habits
 
02:30:15.750 --> 02:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
ultimately affecting our revenue gained
 
02:30:18.389 --> 02:30:18.399 align:start position:0%
from boat registrations here
 
02:30:21.030 --> 02:30:21.040 align:start position:0%
number three concern of impact to boat
 
02:30:23.590 --> 02:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
sales in new hampshire many dealers
 
02:30:25.990 --> 02:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
benefit from massachusetts and many
 
02:30:28.230 --> 02:30:28.240 align:start position:0%
other out-of-state voters that buy and
 
02:30:30.469 --> 02:30:30.479 align:start position:0%
register here in our state if new
 
02:30:32.630 --> 02:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire's registration fees begin to
 
02:30:35.349 --> 02:30:35.359 align:start position:0%
rival the costs in other states we'll
 
02:30:37.670 --> 02:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
lose out on that advantage
 
02:30:39.030 --> 02:30:39.040 align:start position:0%
number four
 
02:30:41.910 --> 02:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
concern of impact of local marine and
 
02:30:44.230 --> 02:30:44.240 align:start position:0%
boat dealers who act as registration
 
02:30:46.710 --> 02:30:46.720 align:start position:0%
agents for the department of safety
 
02:30:48.309 --> 02:30:48.319 align:start position:0%
understanding such a change would
 
02:30:50.630 --> 02:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
require changes in our online system
 
02:30:52.389 --> 02:30:52.399 align:start position:0%
that a lion's share of our membership
 
02:30:52.399 --> 02:30:53.510 align:start position:0%
that a lion's share of our membership
uses

02:30:53.510 --> 02:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
uses
 
02:30:56.070 --> 02:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
we simply don't know how much this
 
02:30:56.080 --> 02:30:57.349 align:start position:0%
we simply don't know how much this
improvement

02:30:57.349 --> 02:30:57.359 align:start position:0%
improvement
 
02:30:59.110 --> 02:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
would cost our dealers and
 
02:31:01.110 --> 02:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities to have our systems
 
02:31:03.190 --> 02:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
updated appropriately
 
02:31:04.950 --> 02:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
number five
 
02:31:07.750 --> 02:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
a specific concern about the mill rate
 
02:31:09.750 --> 02:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
and how it will be implemented
 
02:31:12.070 --> 02:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
there are many boat manufacturers across
 
02:31:14.790 --> 02:31:14.800 align:start position:0%
our country in the world the list price
 
02:31:17.030 --> 02:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
may be a base model but that could
 
02:31:19.990 --> 02:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
change nearly a hundred percent based on
 
02:31:22.630 --> 02:31:22.640 align:start position:0%
options added by the consumer including
 
02:31:25.190 --> 02:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
the engine size trailer and
 
02:31:27.349 --> 02:31:27.359 align:start position:0%
customization packages
 
02:31:29.110 --> 02:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
our group would like to understand and
 
02:31:31.190 --> 02:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
get as much information as possible as
 
02:31:34.870 --> 02:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
to how that calculation would work
 
02:31:37.190 --> 02:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
in trying to estimate how much the
 
02:31:39.590 --> 02:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
increase is stated would be to some of
 
02:31:42.230 --> 02:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
our boating public one of our members
 
02:31:45.510 --> 02:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
tried to estimate the change in the fee
 
02:31:47.750 --> 02:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
understand with limited information on
 
02:31:49.830 --> 02:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
the bill on how the mill system would
 
02:31:49.840 --> 02:31:50.790 align:start position:0%
the bill on how the mill system would
work

02:31:50.790 --> 02:31:50.800 align:start position:0%
work
 
02:31:52.550 --> 02:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
we're doing the best that we can here
 
02:31:54.230 --> 02:31:54.240 align:start position:0%
but these are some
 
02:31:56.469 --> 02:31:56.479 align:start position:0%
excellent examples of what it would cost
 
02:31:58.710 --> 02:31:58.720 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire boater
 
02:32:00.950 --> 02:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
one of the hottest markets in our field
 
02:32:03.110 --> 02:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
right now is a personal watercraft their
 
02:32:06.150 --> 02:32:06.160 align:start position:0%
average sale is fifteen thousand dollars
 
02:32:08.469 --> 02:32:08.479 align:start position:0%
currently uh that's a twenty four dollar
 
02:32:11.750 --> 02:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
registration fee for product only
 
02:32:15.190 --> 02:32:15.200 align:start position:0%
that's under 16 feet that would be a 10x
 
02:32:19.670 --> 02:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
increase to 270 dollars in year one 225
 
02:32:21.910 --> 02:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
dollars in year two and a hundred and
 
02:32:25.110 --> 02:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
eighty dollars in year three
 
02:32:27.270 --> 02:32:27.280 align:start position:0%
the second most popular growth market
 
02:32:29.429 --> 02:32:29.439 align:start position:0%
within the state for our industry is
 
02:32:31.429 --> 02:32:31.439 align:start position:0%
pontoon boats and if you spent any time
 
02:32:33.910 --> 02:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
in any waterway i think you'd agree
 
02:32:36.630 --> 02:32:36.640 align:start position:0%
a sixty thousand dollar pontoon boat is
 
02:32:40.150 --> 02:32:40.160 align:start position:0%
a 52 registration fee today it would be
 
02:32:41.910 --> 02:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
a 20x
 
02:32:45.429 --> 02:32:45.439 align:start position:0%
increase in year one which would move 52
 
02:32:47.750 --> 02:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
to 1080
 
02:32:50.230 --> 02:32:50.240 align:start position:0%
in year two nine hundred dollars year
 
02:32:53.110 --> 02:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
three seven hundred and twenty dollars
 
02:32:55.030 --> 02:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
please note that the calculations above
 
02:32:57.590 --> 02:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
are simply just state registration fees
 
02:32:59.670 --> 02:32:59.680 align:start position:0%
and they do not include
 
02:33:02.190 --> 02:33:02.200 align:start position:0%
other boat fees that go to the town and
 
02:33:04.469 --> 02:33:04.479 align:start position:0%
municipalities or any other fees that
 
02:33:06.630 --> 02:33:06.640 align:start position:0%
would go to search and rescue lake
 
02:33:09.110 --> 02:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
restoration and preservation funds or
 
02:33:12.309 --> 02:33:12.319 align:start position:0%
public boat access funds
 
02:33:15.110 --> 02:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
our membership agrees wholeheartedly
 
02:33:19.429 --> 02:33:19.439 align:start position:0%
that the current fee system is outdated
 
02:33:21.190 --> 02:33:21.200 align:start position:0%
and i believe the last time they were
 
02:33:21.200 --> 02:33:22.469 align:start position:0%
and i believe the last time they were
updated

02:33:22.469 --> 02:33:22.479 align:start position:0%
updated
 
02:33:24.870 --> 02:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
was 2009.
 
02:33:28.150 --> 02:33:28.160 align:start position:0%
we don't believe 1641 is the answer
 
02:33:30.389 --> 02:33:30.399 align:start position:0%
we would uh support a stakeholder group
 
02:33:32.469 --> 02:33:32.479 align:start position:0%
working on this issue and reporting back
 
02:33:35.030 --> 02:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
to you we would volunteer to participate
 
02:33:36.950 --> 02:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
in that effort
 
02:33:40.070 --> 02:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
we asked this committee to find 1641
 
02:33:42.950 --> 02:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate this is simply
 
02:33:44.870 --> 02:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
too big of an increase that we believe
 
02:33:46.710 --> 02:33:46.720 align:start position:0%
would harm recreational voting in our
 
02:33:46.720 --> 02:33:47.590 align:start position:0%
would harm recreational voting in our
state

02:33:47.590 --> 02:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:33:49.190 --> 02:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
and the families that choose to vote
 
02:33:49.200 --> 02:33:50.070 align:start position:0%
and the families that choose to vote
here

02:33:50.070 --> 02:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:33:51.670 --> 02:33:51.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time i'd be happy to
 
02:33:57.670 --> 02:33:57.680 align:start position:0%

representative smith for a question
 
02:34:05.030 --> 02:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:07.190 --> 02:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
well you you uh you got put off to the
 
02:34:10.309 --> 02:34:10.319 align:start position:0%
next person yeah thank you uh mr chair
 
02:34:12.309 --> 02:34:12.319 align:start position:0%
and thank you mr mccallum for taking my
 
02:34:12.319 --> 02:34:13.349 align:start position:0%
and thank you mr mccallum for taking my
question

02:34:13.349 --> 02:34:13.359 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:34:14.710 --> 02:34:14.720 align:start position:0%
uh when you
 
02:34:16.630 --> 02:34:16.640 align:start position:0%
volunteer to be part of a stakeholder
 
02:34:19.910 --> 02:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
group to try to upgrade the update the
 
02:34:19.920 --> 02:34:21.030 align:start position:0%
group to try to upgrade the update the
fees

02:34:21.030 --> 02:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
fees
 
02:34:22.950 --> 02:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
is that something that you think the
 
02:34:25.030 --> 02:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
legislature has to
 
02:34:27.910 --> 02:34:27.920 align:start position:0%
put together or this can this be done
 
02:34:30.309 --> 02:34:30.319 align:start position:0%
with possibly individuals from the
 
02:34:33.349 --> 02:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
legislature in or otherwise other groups
 
02:34:35.030 --> 02:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
putting it together and coming back next
 
02:34:39.429 --> 02:34:39.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:41.030 --> 02:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
excellent question i don't know how that
 
02:34:42.870 --> 02:34:42.880 align:start position:0%
process would look i could tell you that
 
02:34:45.910 --> 02:34:45.920 align:start position:0%
we would like to be involved in it
 
02:34:48.550 --> 02:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:50.790 --> 02:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
representative egan
 
02:34:52.309 --> 02:34:52.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
02:34:53.510 --> 02:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
my question
 
02:34:56.710 --> 02:34:56.720 align:start position:0%
where does new hampshire's boat fees
 
02:34:59.349 --> 02:34:59.359 align:start position:0%
rank in the other six of the six new
 
02:35:01.270 --> 02:35:01.280 align:start position:0%
england states are we
 
02:35:02.950 --> 02:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
the most cost effective or the most
 
02:35:05.990 --> 02:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
costly where do we fit in that
 
02:35:08.710 --> 02:35:08.720 align:start position:0%
parameter if you know
 
02:35:11.110 --> 02:35:11.120 align:start position:0%
do they have a ribbon for fifth place so
 
02:35:12.950 --> 02:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
maine is driven off of sales tax and
 
02:35:14.630 --> 02:35:14.640 align:start position:0%
value um
 
02:35:17.830 --> 02:35:17.840 align:start position:0%
same for massachusetts connecticut
 
02:35:20.790 --> 02:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
uh rhode island and vermont are
 
02:35:23.590 --> 02:35:23.600 align:start position:0%
modest fees online with what we've got
 
02:35:25.190 --> 02:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
but there's there's no question that new
 
02:35:27.590 --> 02:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire gleans the least amount of
 
02:35:29.990 --> 02:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
revenue for vote registration within new
 
02:35:32.950 --> 02:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
england follow up mr church
 
02:35:35.670 --> 02:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
knowing that we are our second largest
 
02:35:39.670 --> 02:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
uh tool of our economy is tourism
 
02:35:41.830 --> 02:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
would fee changes you think affect the
 
02:35:43.510 --> 02:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
fact that voters would come here from
 
02:35:46.230 --> 02:35:46.240 align:start position:0%
other states maybe they do now
 
02:35:49.910 --> 02:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
so you're saying we have a lesser fee
 
02:35:49.920 --> 02:35:51.990 align:start position:0%
so you're saying we have a lesser fee
unquestionably

02:35:51.990 --> 02:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
unquestionably
 
02:35:56.070 --> 02:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:58.309 --> 02:35:58.319 align:start position:0%
any other questions for members of the
 
02:35:58.319 --> 02:36:02.469 align:start position:0%
any other questions for members of the
committee

02:36:02.469 --> 02:36:02.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:04.150 --> 02:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
02:36:08.070 --> 02:36:08.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you

the chair calls
 
02:36:24.230 --> 02:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:25.750 --> 02:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman honourable members
 
02:36:27.670 --> 02:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is tim dunleavy
 
02:36:29.750 --> 02:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
captain with the marine patrol unit of
 
02:36:31.590 --> 02:36:31.600 align:start position:0%
the division of state police
 
02:36:32.790 --> 02:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
i thank you for the opportunity to
 
02:36:37.270 --> 02:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:39.349 --> 02:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
reiterate what folks before me have said
 
02:36:40.950 --> 02:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
but i come before you in opposition of
 
02:36:42.710 --> 02:36:42.720 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:36:44.710 --> 02:36:44.720 align:start position:0%
i will reserve my comments to a couple
 
02:36:46.469 --> 02:36:46.479 align:start position:0%
of little threads that you may have
 
02:36:46.479 --> 02:36:47.349 align:start position:0%
of little threads that you may have
heard

02:36:47.349 --> 02:36:47.359 align:start position:0%
heard
 
02:36:49.510 --> 02:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
by a couple of folks already in that
 
02:36:51.750 --> 02:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
perhaps it's time to look at the way new
 
02:36:54.070 --> 02:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire registers at spokes well we're
 
02:36:56.950 --> 02:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
not in favor of the proposed mill rate
 
02:36:58.870 --> 02:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
we believe that there is some room to
 
02:37:02.230 --> 02:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
apply a mill rate
 
02:37:05.270 --> 02:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
process to the boat registration fees
 
02:37:06.950 --> 02:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
what that would be we think there is a
 
02:37:10.389 --> 02:37:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:12.469 --> 02:37:12.479 align:start position:0%
our concern though lies in some other
 
02:37:15.670 --> 02:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
areas that a lot of folks don't realize
 
02:37:18.150 --> 02:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
where the revenues go that are generated
 
02:37:20.309 --> 02:37:20.319 align:start position:0%
by boat registrations
 
02:37:22.870 --> 02:37:22.880 align:start position:0%
we are a user pays user benefit system
 
02:37:24.950 --> 02:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the registry boat
 
02:37:26.790 --> 02:37:26.800 align:start position:0%
registration process and what i mean by
 
02:37:28.550 --> 02:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
that is
 
02:37:29.670 --> 02:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
when you
 
02:37:31.190 --> 02:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
pay the overall i'll use the term
 
02:37:33.510 --> 02:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
overall expense to register your boat
 
02:37:35.190 --> 02:37:35.200 align:start position:0%
there are numerous
 
02:37:37.910 --> 02:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
agencies that benefit from those those
 
02:37:37.920 --> 02:37:39.910 align:start position:0%
agencies that benefit from those those
revenues

02:37:39.910 --> 02:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
02:37:41.990 --> 02:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
to include the towns in which that boat
 
02:37:43.750 --> 02:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
has been registered in
 
02:37:45.510 --> 02:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
and if you look at
 
02:37:47.190 --> 02:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
the marine patrol budget operation
 
02:37:49.750 --> 02:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
budget we receive a portion of the
 
02:37:51.910 --> 02:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
overall revenues
 
02:37:53.750 --> 02:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
there is a registration fee in chapter
 
02:37:53.760 --> 02:37:55.349 align:start position:0%
there is a registration fee in chapter
270e

02:37:55.349 --> 02:37:55.359 align:start position:0%
270e
 
02:38:00.710 --> 02:38:00.720 align:start position:0%
but there's also the boat fee in rsa 72a
 
02:38:03.190 --> 02:38:03.200 align:start position:0%
significantly different by the way 72a
 
02:38:06.230 --> 02:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
is a much larger amount in most cases
 
02:38:08.150 --> 02:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
and depending upon where you register
 
02:38:09.670 --> 02:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
your boat if you register with the
 
02:38:11.270 --> 02:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
department of safety
 
02:38:14.550 --> 02:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
or through the marine patrol or the dmv
 
02:38:16.550 --> 02:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
not only does the registration fee but
 
02:38:18.790 --> 02:38:18.800 align:start position:0%
the boat fee comes to the navigation
 
02:38:21.349 --> 02:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
safety fund the marine patrol budget
 
02:38:23.190 --> 02:38:23.200 align:start position:0%
but if you register with a marina or a
 
02:38:24.710 --> 02:38:24.720 align:start position:0%
town hall
 
02:38:26.389 --> 02:38:26.399 align:start position:0%
that boat fee the larger portion of the
 
02:38:30.230 --> 02:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
overall expense stays with the town
 
02:38:32.230 --> 02:38:32.240 align:start position:0%
and folks are realizing that there is a
 
02:38:34.790 --> 02:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
windfall to be had here in towns
 
02:38:37.349 --> 02:38:37.359 align:start position:0%
where there's an advantage
 
02:38:37.359 --> 02:38:38.469 align:start position:0%
where there's an advantage
and

02:38:38.469 --> 02:38:38.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:38:39.830 --> 02:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
we are hearing
 
02:38:41.910 --> 02:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
more and more with every passing year
 
02:38:44.870 --> 02:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
why can't we renew our boat online
 
02:38:46.389 --> 02:38:46.399 align:start position:0%
we can do it for everything else these
 
02:38:48.230 --> 02:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
days sit at the computer and renew our
 
02:38:49.830 --> 02:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
boat online
 
02:38:49.840 --> 02:38:51.270 align:start position:0%
boat online
selfishly

02:38:51.270 --> 02:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
selfishly
 
02:38:53.110 --> 02:38:53.120 align:start position:0%
if we allow that to happen and they do
 
02:38:55.270 --> 02:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
it through a town portal
 
02:38:56.950 --> 02:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
those revenues would go to the town and
 
02:38:59.110 --> 02:38:59.120 align:start position:0%
we're fearful that that convenience
 
02:39:01.910 --> 02:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
may seriously impact what the department
 
02:39:03.750 --> 02:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
of safety's operating budget for marine
 
02:39:03.760 --> 02:39:05.110 align:start position:0%
of safety's operating budget for marine
patrol

02:39:05.110 --> 02:39:05.120 align:start position:0%
patrol
 
02:39:06.070 --> 02:39:06.080 align:start position:0%
would would
 
02:39:06.080 --> 02:39:07.510 align:start position:0%
would would
experience

02:39:07.510 --> 02:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
experience
 
02:39:09.349 --> 02:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
these are all things that we recognize
 
02:39:10.950 --> 02:39:10.960 align:start position:0%
we don't want to pull from out from
 
02:39:12.550 --> 02:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
underneath the towns
 
02:39:14.870 --> 02:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
but we want to look at what is the fair
 
02:39:17.670 --> 02:39:17.680 align:start position:0%

application of how these these
revenues

02:39:19.030 --> 02:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
02:39:21.670 --> 02:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
are split up and used
 
02:39:23.670 --> 02:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
my final comment in perhaps most
 
02:39:26.070 --> 02:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
concerning is about half of our budget
 
02:39:28.469 --> 02:39:28.479 align:start position:0%
is operating budget comes from the coast
 
02:39:30.309 --> 02:39:30.319 align:start position:0%
guard voting safety grant
 
02:39:32.710 --> 02:39:32.720 align:start position:0%
those were those that grant is based on
 
02:39:35.830 --> 02:39:35.840 align:start position:0%
on fees generated at the federal level
 
02:39:38.950 --> 02:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
for behind the scenes excise taxes
 
02:39:41.349 --> 02:39:41.359 align:start position:0%
for fishing equipment
 
02:39:44.630 --> 02:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:47.910 --> 02:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
road tax fuel tax off-road tax
 
02:39:49.110 --> 02:39:49.120 align:start position:0%
all of those things are dispersed
 
02:39:51.590 --> 02:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
amongst 56 states not only boating
 
02:39:53.030 --> 02:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
safety agencies but fish and game
 
02:39:57.429 --> 02:39:57.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:58.630 --> 02:39:58.640 align:start position:0%
with every federal grant comes
 
02:39:58.640 --> 02:39:59.990 align:start position:0%
with every federal grant comes
requirements

02:39:59.990 --> 02:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
02:40:02.309 --> 02:40:02.319 align:start position:0%
and interestingly
 
02:40:03.990 --> 02:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
federal code
 
02:40:06.550 --> 02:40:06.560 align:start position:0%
says that we are not allowed to
 
02:40:08.309 --> 02:40:08.319 align:start position:0%
charge or attach
 
02:40:11.830 --> 02:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
any fees outside of a boat registration
 
02:40:13.110 --> 02:40:13.120 align:start position:0%
to the consumer when they want to
 
02:40:14.950 --> 02:40:14.960 align:start position:0%
register their boat
 
02:40:16.550 --> 02:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is in violation of that
 
02:40:18.950 --> 02:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
code because we are collecting numerous
 
02:40:22.070 --> 02:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
fees lake restoration fund which which
 
02:40:24.870 --> 02:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
helped the fight of aquatic invasives
 
02:40:26.389 --> 02:40:26.399 align:start position:0%
public access
 
02:40:26.399 --> 02:40:27.510 align:start position:0%
public access
fees

02:40:27.510 --> 02:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
fees
 
02:40:29.190 --> 02:40:29.200 align:start position:0%
search and rescue fees
 
02:40:31.110 --> 02:40:31.120 align:start position:0%
dredging fees
 
02:40:33.110 --> 02:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
so these these ancillary fees that are
 
02:40:35.750 --> 02:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
attached to that registration process
 
02:40:37.750 --> 02:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
are a violation of federal code and the
 
02:40:39.830 --> 02:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
coast guard has put us on notice that we
 
02:40:42.389 --> 02:40:42.399 align:start position:0%
need to work to somehow remedy that
 
02:40:43.990 --> 02:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
so i come before you
 
02:40:45.750 --> 02:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
echoing what some folks have said before
 
02:40:48.230 --> 02:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
me maybe it's time that we we look at a
 
02:40:51.429 --> 02:40:51.439 align:start position:0%
process to get all stakeholders involved
 
02:40:53.670 --> 02:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
um to look at what is the fair and
 
02:40:55.910 --> 02:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
applicable changes that we can make
 
02:40:59.590 --> 02:40:59.600 align:start position:0%
um and and not necessarily
 
02:41:01.429 --> 02:41:01.439 align:start position:0%
raise the fees to the rate that
 
02:41:03.750 --> 02:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
this bill before you today would
 
02:41:05.910 --> 02:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
but but to look at the overall uh
 
02:41:09.110 --> 02:41:09.120 align:start position:0%
process and and and make the towns
 
02:41:12.710 --> 02:41:12.720 align:start position:0%
marine patrol des fishing game the port
 
02:41:15.030 --> 02:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
authority all happy
 
02:41:16.389 --> 02:41:16.399 align:start position:0%
and with that i'm happy to answer any
 
02:41:16.399 --> 02:41:20.230 align:start position:0%
and with that i'm happy to answer any
questions

02:41:20.230 --> 02:41:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:22.070 --> 02:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
any questions by members of the
 
02:41:22.080 --> 02:41:25.510 align:start position:0%
any questions by members of the
committee

02:41:25.510 --> 02:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:27.190 --> 02:41:27.200 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
02:41:28.630 --> 02:41:28.640 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you mr chair thank you
 
02:41:31.510 --> 02:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
captain for uh taking my question
 
02:41:31.520 --> 02:41:32.309 align:start position:0%
captain for uh taking my question
so

02:41:32.309 --> 02:41:32.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:41:33.750 --> 02:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
i just want to make sure i have this
 
02:41:33.760 --> 02:41:34.710 align:start position:0%
i just want to make sure i have this
right

02:41:34.710 --> 02:41:34.720 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:41:34.720 --> 02:41:35.910 align:start position:0%
right
so

02:41:35.910 --> 02:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:41:38.070 --> 02:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
we have the registration which this bill
 
02:41:39.510 --> 02:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
applies to
 
02:41:41.910 --> 02:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
and then we have the add-ons for fish
 
02:41:44.469 --> 02:41:44.479 align:start position:0%
and game search and rescue for the ais
 
02:41:46.469 --> 02:41:46.479 align:start position:0%
for lakes preservation
 
02:41:48.870 --> 02:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
and that if we want federal grants
 
02:41:50.790 --> 02:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
that's not legal and they're going to
 
02:41:52.469 --> 02:41:52.479 align:start position:0%
cut us off
 
02:41:55.110 --> 02:41:55.120 align:start position:0%
um they are willing to allow us time
 
02:41:56.550 --> 02:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
to remedy that
 
02:41:58.070 --> 02:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
there is no threat to cut us off but
 
02:41:59.750 --> 02:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
certainly it is a condition to comply
 
02:42:01.750 --> 02:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
with those federal codes
 
02:42:05.670 --> 02:42:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:08.870 --> 02:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up how much time
 
02:42:08.880 --> 02:42:10.550 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up how much time
um

02:42:10.550 --> 02:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:42:12.550 --> 02:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
how long do we have if we're showing
 
02:42:14.790 --> 02:42:14.800 align:start position:0%
progress i'm comfortable in saying that
 
02:42:16.950 --> 02:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
they will uh i'll use the expression
 
02:42:18.389 --> 02:42:18.399 align:start position:0%
stay off our back as long as we're
 
02:42:21.349 --> 02:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
showing uh good faith and progress thank
 
02:42:21.359 --> 02:42:22.070 align:start position:0%
showing uh good faith and progress thank
you

02:42:22.070 --> 02:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:42:22.080 --> 02:42:24.950 align:start position:0%
you
okay

02:42:24.950 --> 02:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:27.590 --> 02:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
representative post for a question
 
02:42:29.030 --> 02:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
02:42:29.040 --> 02:42:29.990 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
captain

02:42:29.990 --> 02:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
captain
 
02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:32.150 align:start position:0%
captain
um

02:42:32.150 --> 02:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:42:35.269 --> 02:42:35.279 align:start position:0%
so my question is do you have
 
02:42:37.590 --> 02:42:37.600 align:start position:0%
any suggestions of how you would
 
02:42:39.110 --> 02:42:39.120 align:start position:0%
approach this
 
02:42:42.950 --> 02:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
for a bill to be put forth or do you see
 
02:42:44.309 --> 02:42:44.319 align:start position:0%
this more
 
02:42:44.319 --> 02:42:46.630 align:start position:0%
this more
as

02:42:46.630 --> 02:42:46.640 align:start position:0%
as
 
02:42:49.670 --> 02:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
what mr mccallum had said a group
 
02:42:51.349 --> 02:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
getting together
 
02:42:52.830 --> 02:42:52.840 align:start position:0%
and doing that
 
02:42:55.910 --> 02:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
independently and then making
 
02:42:58.309 --> 02:42:58.319 align:start position:0%
a bill out of that certainly i think the
 
02:43:00.150 --> 02:43:00.160 align:start position:0%
bill before you today needs to be
 
02:43:02.070 --> 02:43:02.080 align:start position:0%
separate from that process
 
02:43:04.070 --> 02:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
uh however if there is a bill next
 
02:43:06.389 --> 02:43:06.399 align:start position:0%
session to to form a study
 
02:43:09.910 --> 02:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
committee or commission uh or if if
 
02:43:11.510 --> 02:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
there are members of this committee and
 
02:43:14.389 --> 02:43:14.399 align:start position:0%
others uh other legislators that might
 
02:43:15.910 --> 02:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
like to become part of a stakeholder
 
02:43:16.950 --> 02:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
group where
 
02:43:19.110 --> 02:43:19.120 align:start position:0%
where folks i think from marine trades
 
02:43:19.120 --> 02:43:20.950 align:start position:0%
where folks i think from marine trades
um

02:43:20.950 --> 02:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:23.670 --> 02:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
the the town clerks um all of those
 
02:43:26.150 --> 02:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
folks des the other state agencies all
 
02:43:28.150 --> 02:43:28.160 align:start position:0%
need to i would recommend have a seat at
 
02:43:29.750 --> 02:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
that table so that all
 
02:43:34.469 --> 02:43:34.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:36.389 --> 02:43:36.399 align:start position:0%
marinas would love to go online it'll
 
02:43:38.630 --> 02:43:38.640 align:start position:0%
save them uh pulling staff away at the
 
02:43:40.469 --> 02:43:40.479 align:start position:0%
counter on 4th of july weekend memorial
 
02:43:43.030 --> 02:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
day weekend but at the same time they
 
02:43:45.269 --> 02:43:45.279 align:start position:0%
want to offer this important service
 
02:43:46.710 --> 02:43:46.720 align:start position:0%
brings people into their showrooms and
 
02:43:48.309 --> 02:43:48.319 align:start position:0%
it's a service that many of them provide
 
02:43:53.030 --> 02:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
their customers that is much appreciated
 
02:43:54.870 --> 02:43:54.880 align:start position:0%
we have some towns i won't mention them
 
02:43:56.230 --> 02:43:56.240 align:start position:0%
specifically but
 
02:43:57.910 --> 02:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
they don't have a single acre of public
 
02:43:59.590 --> 02:43:59.600 align:start position:0%
waters in their town and yet their town
 
02:44:02.070 --> 02:44:02.080 align:start position:0%
clerks are registering boats receiving
 
02:44:04.550 --> 02:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
this significant amount of money
 
02:44:06.790 --> 02:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
that that is not going back to that user
 
02:44:09.269 --> 02:44:09.279 align:start position:0%
pays benefits
 
02:44:10.870 --> 02:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
intent that that you folks at the
 
02:44:12.710 --> 02:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
legislature set up for us
 
02:44:18.550 --> 02:44:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:20.070 --> 02:44:20.080 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up
 
02:44:22.710 --> 02:44:22.720 align:start position:0%
um and perhaps this is
 
02:44:25.510 --> 02:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:29.190 --> 02:44:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:31.510 --> 02:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
having that stakeholder group
 
02:44:31.520 --> 02:44:32.630 align:start position:0%
having that stakeholder group
would

02:44:32.630 --> 02:44:32.640 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:44:36.469 --> 02:44:36.479 align:start position:0%
allow us not to have to fund
 
02:44:40.070 --> 02:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:41.990 --> 02:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
that's a question
 
02:44:43.830 --> 02:44:43.840 align:start position:0%
and not being familiar
 
02:44:45.990 --> 02:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
aside from from from sitting on some of
 
02:44:48.070 --> 02:44:48.080 align:start position:0%
those studies i don't know the
 
02:44:50.630 --> 02:44:50.640 align:start position:0%
background process uh and what all and
 
02:44:53.030 --> 02:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
is involved to to fund something like
 
02:44:56.309 --> 02:44:56.319 align:start position:0%
that or to spin that up
 
02:44:58.550 --> 02:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
but but i will say that i think the
 
02:44:58.560 --> 02:44:59.670 align:start position:0%
but but i will say that i think the
issues

02:44:59.670 --> 02:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
issues
 
02:45:02.150 --> 02:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
behind boat registrations are important
 
02:45:05.349 --> 02:45:05.359 align:start position:0%
enough to be heard by you folks and and
 
02:45:07.269 --> 02:45:07.279 align:start position:0%
and for all those stakeholders to to be
 
02:45:07.279 --> 02:45:08.469 align:start position:0%
and for all those stakeholders to to be
heard

02:45:08.469 --> 02:45:08.479 align:start position:0%
heard
 
02:45:10.389 --> 02:45:10.399 align:start position:0%
whether that avenue is a stakeholder
 
02:45:12.790 --> 02:45:12.800 align:start position:0%
group that presents a report or an
 
02:45:16.070 --> 02:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
actual commission that files a report um
 
02:45:18.230 --> 02:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's time some of these issues
 
02:45:21.750 --> 02:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
are pretty ripe and uh and everybody has
 
02:45:24.790 --> 02:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
should have the opportunity to weigh in

follow-up please for a follow-up
 
02:45:30.710 --> 02:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
so have you had it ever had an
 
02:45:33.349 --> 02:45:33.359 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have a stakeholder group
 
02:45:36.550 --> 02:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
like that working with the legislature
 
02:45:37.990 --> 02:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
that isn't
 
02:45:40.070 --> 02:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
a study that gets
 
02:45:41.510 --> 02:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
i personally have not been involved with
 
02:45:43.830 --> 02:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
one but i'm sure they've existed
 
02:45:43.840 --> 02:45:45.429 align:start position:0%
one but i'm sure they've existed
well

02:45:45.429 --> 02:45:45.439 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:45:48.070 --> 02:45:48.080 align:start position:0%
you've had there are there are

was in deference to the uh
the

the
 
04:02:21.830 --> 04:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
04:02:23.590 --> 04:02:23.600 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor
 
04:02:26.830 --> 04:02:26.840 align:start position:0%
uh he was who was uh
 
04:02:31.110 --> 04:02:31.120 align:start position:0%
ill uh assuming that he would was ill at
 
04:02:33.670 --> 04:02:33.680 align:start position:0%
the time assuming that he will
 
04:02:33.680 --> 04:02:34.469 align:start position:0%
the time assuming that he will
uh

04:02:34.469 --> 04:02:34.479 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:02:35.910 --> 04:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
he would be
 
04:02:35.920 --> 04:02:37.189 align:start position:0%
he would be
better

04:02:37.189 --> 04:02:37.199 align:start position:0%
better
 
04:02:39.110 --> 04:02:39.120 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that's not true so he will
 
04:02:41.349 --> 04:02:41.359 align:start position:0%
not be here uh
 
04:02:45.269 --> 04:02:45.279 align:start position:0%

uh from anyone who wishes to give it uh
 
04:02:49.269 --> 04:02:49.279 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
04:02:49.279 --> 04:02:51.030 align:start position:0%
but uh
uh

04:02:51.030 --> 04:02:51.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:02:54.070 --> 04:02:54.080 align:start position:0%
but unfortunately my best intentions did
 
04:02:55.590 --> 04:02:55.600 align:start position:0%
not work out well
 
04:02:58.790 --> 04:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
so with that uh the chair recognizes
 
04:03:00.790 --> 04:03:00.800 align:start position:0%

04:03:14.550 --> 04:03:14.560 align:start position:0%
holderness in grafton eight and i wrote
 
04:03:16.389 --> 04:03:16.399 align:start position:0%
and i am here today in support of house
 
04:03:18.550 --> 04:03:18.560 align:start position:0%
bill 1227 which amends the prime
 
04:03:20.950 --> 04:03:20.960 align:start position:0%
wetlands statute but first i'd like to
 
04:03:22.550 --> 04:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about wetlands
 
04:03:22.560 --> 04:03:23.750 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about wetlands
generally

04:03:23.750 --> 04:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
generally
 
04:03:26.309 --> 04:03:26.319 align:start position:0%
wetlands provide a valuable service to
 
04:03:28.630 --> 04:03:28.640 align:start position:0%
society and the environment besides
 
04:03:30.710 --> 04:03:30.720 align:start position:0%
sustaining a huge number of plant and
 
04:03:32.790 --> 04:03:32.800 align:start position:0%
animal species they can improve water
 
04:03:35.269 --> 04:03:35.279 align:start position:0%
quality reduce erosion and prevent
 
04:03:35.279 --> 04:03:36.469 align:start position:0%
quality reduce erosion and prevent
flooding

04:03:36.469 --> 04:03:36.479 align:start position:0%
flooding
 
04:03:38.870 --> 04:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
those who use the term swamp to describe
 
04:03:40.950 --> 04:03:40.960 align:start position:0%
wetlands which they are
 
04:03:42.950 --> 04:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
keep in mind that the dredging and the
 
04:03:45.910 --> 04:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
destruction of the delta swamps i.e the
 
04:03:48.790 --> 04:03:48.800 align:start position:0%
wetlands in louisiana made it far easier
 
04:03:51.590 --> 04:03:51.600 align:start position:0%
for rising waters to flood new orleans
 
04:03:53.670 --> 04:03:53.680 align:start position:0%
wetlands there with their mangrove trees
 
04:03:57.269 --> 04:03:57.279 align:start position:0%
and bushes which thrive in the wet areas
 
04:04:00.150 --> 04:04:00.160 align:start position:0%
shield the uplands the dry areas further
 
04:04:00.160 --> 04:04:02.070 align:start position:0%
shield the uplands the dry areas further
upstream

04:04:02.070 --> 04:04:02.080 align:start position:0%
upstream
 
04:04:04.229 --> 04:04:04.239 align:start position:0%
where i live there are many steep slopes
 
04:04:06.309 --> 04:04:06.319 align:start position:0%
streams which usually trickle down the
 
04:04:08.870 --> 04:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
mountain then they become roaring brooks
 
04:04:11.269 --> 04:04:11.279 align:start position:0%
after a heavy rain and then they join
 
04:04:13.830 --> 04:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
other larger brooks and these then crash
 
04:04:16.790 --> 04:04:16.800 align:start position:0%
towards our pristine newfound lake
 
04:04:18.870 --> 04:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
but before dragging sediment down the
 
04:04:20.710 --> 04:04:20.720 align:start position:0%
mountain it through the brook and into
 
04:04:23.670 --> 04:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
the lake a large wetlands complex lies
 
04:04:26.229 --> 04:04:26.239 align:start position:0%
in the water's path the water spreads
 
04:04:29.110 --> 04:04:29.120 align:start position:0%
out it slows down stopped in its tracks
 
04:04:31.510 --> 04:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
by the wetland the lake is protected and
 
04:04:33.990 --> 04:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
the wetlands prevent flooding filter out
 
04:04:36.389 --> 04:04:36.399 align:start position:0%
any debris whether it's leaves and silt
 
04:04:38.550 --> 04:04:38.560 align:start position:0%
or toxins from overwhelmed septic
 
04:04:40.870 --> 04:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
systems higher up in the watershed
 
04:04:43.269 --> 04:04:43.279 align:start position:0%
call them swamps bogs or marshes they're
 
04:04:45.750 --> 04:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
all wetlands they minimize flooding
 
04:04:47.750 --> 04:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
protect our lakes and rivers and provide
 
04:04:50.389 --> 04:04:50.399 align:start position:0%
valuable habitat for wildlife
 
04:04:52.710 --> 04:04:52.720 align:start position:0%
prime wetlands which are defined in rsa
 
04:04:56.950 --> 04:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
482 a15 only apply to wetlands two acres
 
04:05:00.790 --> 04:05:00.800 align:start position:0%
or more in size they are a local option
 
04:05:03.990 --> 04:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
no prime wetlands can be put into place
 
04:05:06.870 --> 04:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
without the town voting on it
 
04:05:08.229 --> 04:05:08.239 align:start position:0%
and passing
 
04:05:11.510 --> 04:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
passing the ordinance
 
04:05:13.349 --> 04:05:13.359 align:start position:0%
since the first prime wetland statute
 
04:05:15.510 --> 04:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
passed in 1991
 
04:05:18.950 --> 04:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
33 towns have adopted prime wetlands it
 
04:05:21.189 --> 04:05:21.199 align:start position:0%
is not an easy process towns are
 
04:05:23.750 --> 04:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
required to perform an extensive review
 
04:05:25.830 --> 04:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
hold public hearings after notifying all
 
04:05:27.830 --> 04:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
abutters and then finally vote on
 
04:05:30.070 --> 04:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
whether to designate a specific prime
 
04:05:30.080 --> 04:05:31.349 align:start position:0%
whether to designate a specific prime
wetland

04:05:31.349 --> 04:05:31.359 align:start position:0%
wetland
 
04:05:34.389 --> 04:05:34.399 align:start position:0%
then after all of this work des reviews
 
04:05:36.790 --> 04:05:36.800 align:start position:0%
all of their documentation including the
 
04:05:39.189 --> 04:05:39.199 align:start position:0%
town's vote and then they approve or
 
04:05:41.830 --> 04:05:41.840 align:start position:0%
deny the designation
 
04:05:44.710 --> 04:05:44.720 align:start position:0%
hospital 1227 restores status of the
 
04:05:47.110 --> 04:05:47.120 align:start position:0%
edges of the small connecting streams
 
04:05:49.030 --> 04:05:49.040 align:start position:0%
which are sometimes called fingers and
 
04:05:52.790 --> 04:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
toes it excludes ditches and culverts
 
04:05:54.630 --> 04:05:54.640 align:start position:0%
which we heard from d.o.t is something
 
04:05:56.309 --> 04:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
they were happy with
 
04:05:59.110 --> 04:05:59.120 align:start position:0%
this component of the statute excluding
 
04:06:01.110 --> 04:06:01.120 align:start position:0%
the fingers and toes was removed in
 
04:06:01.120 --> 04:06:03.189 align:start position:0%
the fingers and toes was removed in
2012.

04:06:03.189 --> 04:06:03.199 align:start position:0%
2012.
 
04:06:05.429 --> 04:06:05.439 align:start position:0%
and i want to uh end with a quick quote
 
04:06:07.750 --> 04:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
from certified wetland scientist dr rick
 
04:06:11.910 --> 04:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
vandepole who between 1991 and 2012
 
04:06:14.630 --> 04:06:14.640 align:start position:0%
assisted many of the towns who passed
 
04:06:16.710 --> 04:06:16.720 align:start position:0%
prime wetland ordinances
 
04:06:18.870 --> 04:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
please keep in mind and this is from dr
 
04:06:20.870 --> 04:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
van der pol please keep in mind that
 
04:06:22.710 --> 04:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
passing this bill will not ensure that
 
04:06:25.030 --> 04:06:25.040 align:start position:0%
every town in the state will do this it
 
04:06:27.349 --> 04:06:27.359 align:start position:0%
still takes a lot of hard work lots of
 
04:06:29.670 --> 04:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
consultant fees state approval of very
 
04:06:32.070 --> 04:06:32.080 align:start position:0%
specific maps and the consent of a
 
04:06:35.030 --> 04:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
majority of the voters in the town
 
04:06:37.910 --> 04:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
so thank you for your consideration
 
04:06:40.550 --> 04:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
and i hope you will support this bill
 
04:06:43.349 --> 04:06:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:45.990 --> 04:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
is there any questions by members of the
 
04:06:46.000 --> 04:06:50.550 align:start position:0%
is there any questions by members of the
committee

04:06:50.550 --> 04:06:50.560 align:start position:0%

04:06:56.550 --> 04:06:56.560 align:start position:0%
the board
 
04:06:58.389 --> 04:06:58.399 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
04:06:58.399 --> 04:07:06.950 align:start position:0%
your testimony
okay

04:07:06.950 --> 04:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:09.349 --> 04:07:09.359 align:start position:0%
the only other pink card i have is uh
 
04:07:11.990 --> 04:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
kevin nyan
 
04:07:13.750 --> 04:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
department of transportation if you wish
 
04:07:28.870 --> 04:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:30.150 --> 04:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
all right thanks sorry about that thank
 
04:07:32.150 --> 04:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman members of the committee
 
04:07:34.389 --> 04:07:34.399 align:start position:0%
for the record kevin nyan uh department
 
04:07:38.229 --> 04:07:38.239 align:start position:0%
of transportation and i did testify
 
04:07:40.630 --> 04:07:40.640 align:start position:0%
i think a couple of weeks ago now
 
04:07:42.070 --> 04:07:42.080 align:start position:0%
also expecting that representative
 
04:07:43.910 --> 04:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
grassy would be here today
 
04:07:46.070 --> 04:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
and at the time i testified in support
 
04:07:47.429 --> 04:07:47.439 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
04:07:47.439 --> 04:07:49.110 align:start position:0%
of the bill
and

04:07:49.110 --> 04:07:49.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:07:50.790 --> 04:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
it's been a number of years now that the
 
04:07:52.790 --> 04:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
department worked with representative
 
04:07:55.590 --> 04:07:55.600 align:start position:0%
grassy on getting the language included
 
04:07:58.950 --> 04:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
i think it's lines 21 and through 23 of
 
04:08:00.389 --> 04:08:00.399 align:start position:0%
the belt the bill that deals
 
04:08:03.510 --> 04:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
specifically with prime wetlands in the
 
04:08:05.910 --> 04:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
context of the state right-of-way
 
04:08:08.149 --> 04:08:08.159 align:start position:0%
uh and since that time you know and it
 
04:08:08.159 --> 04:08:09.990 align:start position:0%
uh and since that time you know and it
was

04:08:09.990 --> 04:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:08:13.910 --> 04:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
reflected again after uh the last uh the
 
04:08:16.229 --> 04:08:16.239 align:start position:0%
beginning of the the hearing
 
04:08:18.389 --> 04:08:18.399 align:start position:0%
that there are a number of folks who
 
04:08:20.710 --> 04:08:20.720 align:start position:0%
have been testifying uh in opposition to
 
04:08:23.590 --> 04:08:23.600 align:start position:0%
the bill and i understand their position
 
04:08:25.269 --> 04:08:25.279 align:start position:0%
and though for the last number of years
 
04:08:27.030 --> 04:08:27.040 align:start position:0%
the our language i would
 
04:08:30.550 --> 04:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
that we worked on specific to dot has
 
04:08:33.030 --> 04:08:33.040 align:start position:0%
kind of gone along with the bill and
 
04:08:34.790 --> 04:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
gone along with the bill and and i i
 
04:08:37.349 --> 04:08:37.359 align:start position:0%
haven't heard any specific testimony
 
04:08:39.510 --> 04:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
opposing the language that we worked to
 
04:08:41.990 --> 04:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
include i think most folks recognize
 
04:08:45.590 --> 04:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
that that will that that language uh
 
04:08:45.600 --> 04:08:47.590 align:start position:0%
that that will that that language uh
represents

04:08:47.590 --> 04:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
represents
 
04:08:49.830 --> 04:08:49.840 align:start position:0%
a burden to the department that you know
 
04:08:52.469 --> 04:08:52.479 align:start position:0%
isn't necessary uh for the work that we
 
04:08:55.110 --> 04:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
do and so i guess my ask and
 
04:08:57.590 --> 04:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
continuation of my original testimony
 
04:08:59.750 --> 04:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
would be that not knowing if this is
 
04:09:01.910 --> 04:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
improper or not or or how it works for
 
04:09:03.670 --> 04:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
you folks that
 
04:09:03.680 --> 04:09:04.550 align:start position:0%
you folks that
if

04:09:04.550 --> 04:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:09:06.790 --> 04:09:06.800 align:start position:0%
you know if in your deliberations
 
04:09:07.910 --> 04:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
following the hearing when you're
 
04:09:10.070 --> 04:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
exacting the bill
 
04:09:11.750 --> 04:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
if you find it
 
04:09:14.149 --> 04:09:14.159 align:start position:0%
that the bill that the bill would likely
 
04:09:16.950 --> 04:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
be in exceeding to legislate that you
 
04:09:16.960 --> 04:09:18.070 align:start position:0%
be in exceeding to legislate that you
consider

04:09:18.070 --> 04:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
consider
 
04:09:20.389 --> 04:09:20.399 align:start position:0%
um retaining the language at the at the
 
04:09:22.950 --> 04:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
bottom of the bill the d.o.t language
 
04:09:25.670 --> 04:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
so that we're you know we we don't uh
 
04:09:26.830 --> 04:09:26.840 align:start position:0%
if and when
 
04:09:29.990 --> 04:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
um if the bill is found and expedient to
 
04:09:32.630 --> 04:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
legislate at least the d.o.t language
 
04:09:35.110 --> 04:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
that folks have not had opposition to
 
04:09:37.030 --> 04:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't necessarily need to be you know
 
04:09:39.590 --> 04:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
brought up year after year so i'm not
 
04:09:41.349 --> 04:09:41.359 align:start position:0%
speaking to the validity and of the
 
04:09:44.950 --> 04:09:44.960 align:start position:0%
science or of um or or of
 
04:09:44.960 --> 04:09:46.149 align:start position:0%
science or of um or or of
um

04:09:46.149 --> 04:09:46.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:48.149 --> 04:09:48.159 align:start position:0%
you know the original language uh
 
04:09:50.469 --> 04:09:50.479 align:start position:0%
whatever whatever happens with the bill
 
04:09:52.309 --> 04:09:52.319 align:start position:0%
whatever the definition is of prime
 
04:09:54.389 --> 04:09:54.399 align:start position:0%
wetlands obviously the department will
 
04:09:56.389 --> 04:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
follow that definition but it would be
 
04:09:57.990 --> 04:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
helpful if we were able to retain that
 
04:09:59.510 --> 04:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
language should the committee find the
 
04:10:01.830 --> 04:10:01.840 align:start position:0%
bill and expedient to legislate so with
 
04:10:03.830 --> 04:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
that i conclude my testimony and i'm
 
04:10:05.269 --> 04:10:05.279 align:start position:0%

04:48:22.628 --> 04:48:22.638 align:start position:0%
staffing demands
 
04:48:24.550 --> 04:48:24.560 align:start position:0%

opportunity to pay their fine once they
 
04:48:37.030 --> 04:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
leave the state and that keeps us from
 
04:48:38.390 --> 04:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
losing revenue while tracking
 
04:48:40.628 --> 04:48:40.638 align:start position:0%

via an online communications and this
 
04:48:49.990 --> 04:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
bill does not do away with the
 
04:48:52.390 --> 04:48:52.400 align:start position:0%
time-honored tradition that people
 
04:48:54.390 --> 04:48:54.400 align:start position:0%
will have going to the do their
 
04:48:56.150 --> 04:48:56.160 align:start position:0%

04:49:03.750 --> 04:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
those who prefer to utilize that message
 
04:49:05.350 --> 04:49:05.360 align:start position:0%
can now do so
 
04:49:07.190 --> 04:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
this bill is important in supporting our
 
04:49:09.830 --> 04:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
valuable tourism economy easing burden
 
04:49:11.910 --> 04:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
on small businesses modernizing our
 
04:49:13.830 --> 04:49:13.840 align:start position:0%
transaction process for the consumer and
 
04:49:15.670 --> 04:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
the agency and supporting our
 
04:49:18.150 --> 04:49:18.160 align:start position:0%
understaffed hardworking fish and game
 
04:49:20.150 --> 04:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
department i see it as enabling
 
04:49:22.708 --> 04:49:22.718 align:start position:0%
legislation done in consultation with
 
04:49:24.150 --> 04:49:24.160 align:start position:0%
fish and game and the communities that
 
04:49:25.270 --> 04:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
they serve
 
04:49:27.430 --> 04:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
and this is a simple bill that has a
 
04:49:29.190 --> 04:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
tremendous positive impact on new
 
04:49:31.110 --> 04:49:31.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire residents and
 
04:49:32.868 --> 04:49:32.878 align:start position:0%
our visitors who come to enjoy our
 
04:49:35.990 --> 04:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
mountains woods lakes streams and trails
 
04:49:37.270 --> 04:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
as well
 
04:49:39.270 --> 04:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
in further conversation with fish and
 
04:49:41.830 --> 04:49:41.840 align:start position:0%
game i did also create an amendment if
 
04:49:44.310 --> 04:49:44.320 align:start position:0%
you feel that this bill is worthy
 
04:49:46.390 --> 04:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
for discussion executive session which i
 
04:49:48.868 --> 04:49:48.878 align:start position:0%
have handed out to you which actually
 
04:49:51.750 --> 04:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
clarifies a timeline for the online
 
04:49:54.788 --> 04:49:54.798 align:start position:0%
process to be taken into consideration
 
04:49:57.590 --> 04:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
given fish and game has some
 
04:49:59.430 --> 04:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
vendor contract rules that they have to
 
04:50:01.990 --> 04:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
follow and it gives them more time to be
 
04:50:05.110 --> 04:50:05.120 align:start position:0%
able to process the development of this
 
04:50:07.110 --> 04:50:07.120 align:start position:0%
online system
 
04:50:08.470 --> 04:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
thank you so much glad to take any
 
04:50:08.480 --> 04:50:13.030 align:start position:0%
thank you so much glad to take any
questions

04:50:13.030 --> 04:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:14.470 --> 04:50:14.480 align:start position:0%
actually my first question is do you
 
04:50:17.990 --> 04:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
have any more copies of the amendment
 
04:50:19.350 --> 04:50:19.360 align:start position:0%
i apologize
 
04:50:19.360 --> 04:50:27.270 align:start position:0%
i apologize
okay

04:50:27.270 --> 04:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:30.150 --> 04:50:30.160 align:start position:0%
anyone else have it representative smith
 
04:50:31.590 --> 04:50:31.600 align:start position:0%
actually now i have a real question
 
04:50:32.788 --> 04:50:32.798 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
04:50:35.190 --> 04:50:35.200 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
04:50:37.350 --> 04:50:37.360 align:start position:0%
so presently um
 
04:50:37.360 --> 04:50:38.550 align:start position:0%
so presently um
stores

04:50:38.550 --> 04:50:38.560 align:start position:0%
stores
 
04:50:39.910 --> 04:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
you know do
 
04:50:41.990 --> 04:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
provide registration
 
04:50:44.708 --> 04:50:44.718 align:start position:0%
for your ohrv or snowmobile
 
04:50:44.718 --> 04:50:45.590 align:start position:0%
for your ohrv or snowmobile
and

04:50:45.590 --> 04:50:45.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:50:49.030 --> 04:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
so who gets the funds collected on the
 
04:50:51.510 --> 04:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
registration if they purchase it at like
 
04:50:53.990 --> 04:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
my local hebron village store
 
04:50:57.190 --> 04:50:57.200 align:start position:0%
versus if they would be doing it online
 
04:50:59.190 --> 04:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
so the funds still go to the state but
 
04:51:01.510 --> 04:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
there are clubs that do registrations
 
04:51:03.510 --> 04:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
and therefore you can get discounts if
 
04:51:05.510 --> 04:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
you're a member of a club
 
04:51:07.510 --> 04:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
so that information will be factored
 
04:51:10.708 --> 04:51:10.718 align:start position:0%
into the online system this again is why
 
04:51:12.470 --> 04:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
the amendment is to give the fish and
 
04:51:14.390 --> 04:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
game department more time to make sure
 
04:51:16.230 --> 04:51:16.240 align:start position:0%
that they accurately
 
04:51:18.070 --> 04:51:18.080 align:start position:0%
work with the snowmobile association and
 
04:51:20.390 --> 04:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
the ohrp associations who have the list
 
04:51:25.350 --> 04:51:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:25.360 --> 04:51:26.310 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:51:26.310 --> 04:51:26.320 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:51:30.070 --> 04:51:30.080 align:start position:0%
so i guess the question is do stores get
 
04:51:32.550 --> 04:51:32.560 align:start position:0%
that are providing that service of
 
04:51:34.868 --> 04:51:34.878 align:start position:0%
registering your ohrv or snowmobile do
 
04:51:37.190 --> 04:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
they get a cut
 
04:51:40.150 --> 04:51:40.160 align:start position:0%
of the funds i will probably
 
04:51:42.070 --> 04:51:42.080 align:start position:0%
defer to someone from fishing games will
 
04:51:43.590 --> 04:51:43.600 align:start position:0%
be more specific about how the internal
 
04:51:49.430 --> 04:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:50.550 --> 04:51:50.560 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the
 
04:51:50.560 --> 04:51:51.910 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the
representative

04:51:51.910 --> 04:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:51:53.990 --> 04:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
representative creighton
 
04:51:55.510 --> 04:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
yes sir thank you and representative
 
04:51:58.390 --> 04:51:58.400 align:start position:0%
thank you appreciate it um
 
04:52:00.708 --> 04:52:00.718 align:start position:0%
do we have to do this i mean can't fish
 
04:52:02.628 --> 04:52:02.638 align:start position:0%
and game just they've already i mean i
 
04:52:05.030 --> 04:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
bought my license two days ago online
 
04:52:06.628 --> 04:52:06.638 align:start position:0%
this can't be added to their current
 
04:52:09.990 --> 04:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
system you bought your license for
 
04:52:11.990 --> 04:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
fishing and hunting right they can do
 
04:52:14.628 --> 04:52:14.638 align:start position:0%
that now they cannot do that for ohrv
 
04:52:16.708 --> 04:52:16.718 align:start position:0%
and snowmobile and we have to order them
 
04:52:20.628 --> 04:52:20.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:23.590 --> 04:52:23.600 align:start position:0%
again i'll defer to the law enforcement
 
04:52:25.910 --> 04:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
officials at fish and game regarding the
 
04:52:29.670 --> 04:52:29.680 align:start position:0%
have to i don't i do think we have to
 
04:52:31.670 --> 04:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
enable them
 
04:52:33.670 --> 04:52:33.680 align:start position:0%
okay all right
 
04:52:34.628 --> 04:52:34.638 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:52:36.150 --> 04:52:36.160 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions for the
 
04:52:36.160 --> 04:52:38.390 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions for the
representative

04:52:38.390 --> 04:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:52:40.788 --> 04:52:40.798 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you representative
 
04:52:43.110 --> 04:52:43.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
04:52:44.868 --> 04:52:44.878 align:start position:0%
since there were some questions for fish
 
04:52:47.270 --> 04:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
and game our next speaker will be
 
04:52:50.550 --> 04:52:50.560 align:start position:0%
captain eastman from fish and game
 
04:52:53.750 --> 04:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
in support of the bill with an amendment
 
04:52:55.030 --> 04:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
10 minutes
 
04:53:01.110 --> 04:53:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:01.120 --> 04:53:03.510 align:start position:0%
 
mike

04:53:03.510 --> 04:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:04.708 --> 04:53:04.718 align:start position:0%
originally the
 
04:53:07.510 --> 04:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
commission was not in favor of the way
 
04:53:09.110 --> 04:53:09.120 align:start position:0%
that this was written just due to the
 
04:53:11.030 --> 04:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
fact that it would give us 60 days to
 
04:53:12.390 --> 04:53:12.400 align:start position:0%
establish this
 
04:53:12.400 --> 04:53:13.510 align:start position:0%
establish this
um

04:53:13.510 --> 04:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:53:15.910 --> 04:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
it was not cost would not be cost
 
04:53:18.150 --> 04:53:18.160 align:start position:0%
effective for the department or for you
 
04:53:20.070 --> 04:53:20.080 align:start position:0%
know really the state to to go ahead and
 
04:53:22.150 --> 04:53:22.160 align:start position:0%
establish something of this nature in
 
04:53:24.150 --> 04:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
that short amount of time uh with this
 
04:53:26.470 --> 04:53:26.480 align:start position:0%
amendment uh pushing this out september
 
04:53:29.430 --> 04:53:29.440 align:start position:0%
1st of 2025 it would allow us to do that
 
04:53:31.910 --> 04:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
um so to your question about you know
 
04:53:34.708 --> 04:53:34.718 align:start position:0%
purchasing a license right now
 
04:53:37.750 --> 04:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
is that we have what's called an s3
 
04:53:39.670 --> 04:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
is a basically a vendor that we have
 
04:53:42.470 --> 04:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
that does the online licensing system
 
04:53:44.708 --> 04:53:44.718 align:start position:0%
um the issue that's always been with
 
04:53:46.550 --> 04:53:46.560 align:start position:0%
registrations is making sure that
 
04:53:47.910 --> 04:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
obviously the eyes are dotted and the
 
04:53:49.990 --> 04:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
t's are crossed um you know on that
 
04:53:52.150 --> 04:53:52.160 align:start position:0%
original registration due to the fact
 
04:53:52.160 --> 04:53:52.868 align:start position:0%
original registration due to the fact
that

04:53:52.868 --> 04:53:52.878 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:53:54.230 --> 04:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
you know we do get machines that are
 
04:53:56.788 --> 04:53:56.798 align:start position:0%
stolen and and
 
04:53:58.628 --> 04:53:58.638 align:start position:0%
when they're sold there's some you know
 
04:54:00.868 --> 04:54:00.878 align:start position:0%
the vin numbers need to be you know
 
04:54:03.190 --> 04:54:03.200 align:start position:0%
accurate and things like that so um
 
04:54:05.110 --> 04:54:05.120 align:start position:0%
really uh you know
 
04:54:06.550 --> 04:54:06.560 align:start position:0%
allowing us to
 
04:54:08.230 --> 04:54:08.240 align:start position:0%
um well and the other part of that is
 
04:54:10.628 --> 04:54:10.638 align:start position:0%
that this contract with this vendor is
 
04:54:13.430 --> 04:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
soon to be done in 2023 or will look to
 
04:54:16.390 --> 04:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
go look for bids and vendors so to
 
04:54:18.708 --> 04:54:18.718 align:start position:0%
establish something right now and then
 
04:54:20.550 --> 04:54:20.560 align:start position:0%
and roll it out and then look to go to a
 
04:54:23.190 --> 04:54:23.200 align:start position:0%
new vendor within six months once again
 
04:54:25.350 --> 04:54:25.360 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be cost effective so
 
04:54:27.590 --> 04:54:27.600 align:start position:0%
really establishing this date allows us
 
04:54:30.230 --> 04:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
to go to find a vendor establish what we
 
04:54:30.240 --> 04:54:31.270 align:start position:0%
to go to find a vendor establish what we
need

04:54:31.270 --> 04:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
need
 
04:54:33.670 --> 04:54:33.680 align:start position:0%
and it would be our recommendation this
 
04:54:36.868 --> 04:54:36.878 align:start position:0%
is a renewal program uh just there's
 
04:54:39.350 --> 04:54:39.360 align:start position:0%
really no other online service that
 
04:54:42.550 --> 04:54:42.560 align:start position:0%
allows you to register you know a motor
 
04:54:44.310 --> 04:54:44.320 align:start position:0%
you can't register a brand new motor
 
04:54:46.788 --> 04:54:46.798 align:start position:0%
vehicle online it's all renewal so it's
 
04:54:49.110 --> 04:54:49.120 align:start position:0%
really a convenience for those that
 
04:54:51.030 --> 04:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
already have a registration you'll want
 
04:54:53.030 --> 04:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
to get it registered and they'll get
 
04:54:54.708 --> 04:54:54.718 align:start position:0%
there you know we already have a mailing
 
04:54:56.470 --> 04:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
process where they do that or can do
 
04:54:56.480 --> 04:54:57.670 align:start position:0%
process where they do that or can do
that

04:54:57.670 --> 04:54:57.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:54:59.910 --> 04:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
but this yeah so this would really you
 
04:55:01.910 --> 04:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
know assist with that and give us some
 
04:55:03.990 --> 04:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
time to establish that
 
04:55:06.150 --> 04:55:06.160 align:start position:0%
so with that amendment we would be in
 
04:55:09.910 --> 04:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:10.830 --> 04:55:10.840 align:start position:0%
thank you

again
 
04:55:19.510 --> 04:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
you from your perspective
 
04:55:21.750 --> 04:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
we have to approve this bill
 
04:55:24.310 --> 04:55:24.320 align:start position:0%
for you to do that you just can't say
 
04:55:26.150 --> 04:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
that this is my job and i'm doing my job
 
04:55:29.590 --> 04:55:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:31.750 --> 04:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
i want to answer you honestly so i'll do
 
04:55:31.760 --> 04:55:34.070 align:start position:0%
i want to answer you honestly so i'll do
that

04:55:34.070 --> 04:55:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:36.070 --> 04:55:36.080 align:start position:0%
so i originally went to our department
 
04:55:38.628 --> 04:55:38.638 align:start position:0%
with this plan and asked that that we
 
04:55:41.990 --> 04:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
start to get a concept for this um i
 
04:55:43.990 --> 04:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
received a lot of blowback from that
 
04:55:45.430 --> 04:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
from which people didn't even want to
 
04:55:47.910 --> 04:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
talk to me for about a month um but i
 
04:55:49.430 --> 04:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
think this would really get us in the
 
04:55:51.990 --> 04:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
right position so um
 
04:55:55.030 --> 04:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that's the way it works
 
04:55:57.030 --> 04:55:57.040 align:start position:0%
and we want to get you know into the
 
04:55:59.590 --> 04:55:59.600 align:start position:0%
current century that we're in now so
 
04:56:01.830 --> 04:56:01.840 align:start position:0%
yes unfortunately
 
04:56:03.750 --> 04:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
for a follow-on also just from a
 
04:56:06.390 --> 04:56:06.400 align:start position:0%
personal note does that include uh
 
04:56:08.788 --> 04:56:08.798 align:start position:0%
guides hunting and fishing guides
 
04:56:10.550 --> 04:56:10.560 align:start position:0%
so i don't have to beat my way down to
 
04:56:11.670 --> 04:56:11.680 align:start position:0%
your shop
 
04:56:13.350 --> 04:56:13.360 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we're not there yet with
 
04:56:13.360 --> 04:56:14.150 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we're not there yet with
guys

04:56:14.150 --> 04:56:14.160 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
04:56:18.628 --> 04:56:18.638 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
04:56:20.470 --> 04:56:20.480 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
04:56:22.470 --> 04:56:22.480 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you captain eastman
 
04:56:22.480 --> 04:56:23.350 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you captain eastman
um

04:56:23.350 --> 04:56:23.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:25.190 --> 04:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
are you the one who can answer my
 
04:56:26.708 --> 04:56:26.718 align:start position:0%
question about
 
04:56:30.310 --> 04:56:30.320 align:start position:0%
do stores uh get a get a portion of the
 
04:56:33.190 --> 04:56:33.200 align:start position:0%
registration fees when people register
 
04:56:37.350 --> 04:56:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:39.510 --> 04:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
that was another issue that we had
 
04:56:41.430 --> 04:56:41.440 align:start position:0%
with this with the original
 
04:56:43.030 --> 04:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
writing of this bill
 
04:56:45.030 --> 04:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
was that or that the commission had was
 
04:56:47.830 --> 04:56:47.840 align:start position:0%
that it really didn't lay out if this
 
04:56:50.070 --> 04:56:50.080 align:start position:0%
would just be contin just just online
 
04:56:51.590 --> 04:56:51.600 align:start position:0%
all the way around or if it would still
 
04:56:52.948 --> 04:56:52.958 align:start position:0%
be private
 
04:56:52.958 --> 04:56:53.670 align:start position:0%
be private
or

04:56:53.670 --> 04:56:53.680 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:56:55.990 --> 04:56:56.000 align:start position:0%
rent excuse me registration agents that
 
04:56:58.948 --> 04:56:58.958 align:start position:0%
did this so um it was never our
 
04:57:01.430 --> 04:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
intention that um or i globally
 
04:57:03.590 --> 04:57:03.600 align:start position:0%
represented vegan's intention that
 
04:57:05.510 --> 04:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
that these vendors or agents would go
 
04:57:08.948 --> 04:57:08.958 align:start position:0%
away so if someone now goes to a local
 
04:57:12.070 --> 04:57:12.080 align:start position:0%
let's say a local hrv snowmobile
 
04:57:14.230 --> 04:57:14.240 align:start position:0%
establishment that is a registration
 
04:57:17.670 --> 04:57:17.680 align:start position:0%
agent with us and registers a snowmobile
 
04:57:20.550 --> 04:57:20.560 align:start position:0%
um ohrv they
 
04:57:22.550 --> 04:57:22.560 align:start position:0%
are they are charged the price plus a
 
04:57:25.910 --> 04:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
four dollar fee which the agent gets um
 
04:57:28.550 --> 04:57:28.560 align:start position:0%
for their you know for basically their
 
04:57:30.708 --> 04:57:30.718 align:start position:0%
them doing the paperwork and and
 
04:57:32.150 --> 04:57:32.160 align:start position:0%
everything else and sending it in and
 
04:57:34.150 --> 04:57:34.160 align:start position:0%
soon with the with the new tiered system
 
04:57:39.350 --> 04:57:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:41.190 --> 04:57:41.200 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
04:57:44.070 --> 04:57:44.080 align:start position:0%
so it's an extra fee that's tacked on
 
04:57:47.830 --> 04:57:47.840 align:start position:0%
when you pay at a not right there
 
04:57:49.270 --> 04:57:49.280 align:start position:0%
is that what you're saying
 
04:57:51.190 --> 04:57:51.200 align:start position:0%
that's correct okay there's also a
 
04:57:52.868 --> 04:57:52.878 align:start position:0%
system where you can currently register
 
04:57:54.310 --> 04:57:54.320 align:start position:0%
through the mail
 
04:57:56.230 --> 04:57:56.240 align:start position:0%
through fish and game
 
04:57:57.590 --> 04:57:57.600 align:start position:0%
and that same
 
04:57:59.670 --> 04:57:59.680 align:start position:0%
fee still apply so instead of it going
 
04:58:02.310 --> 04:58:02.320 align:start position:0%
to that vendor it would come just a fish
 
04:58:03.350 --> 04:58:03.360 align:start position:0%
and game
 
04:58:05.750 --> 04:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:08.150 --> 04:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the captain i
 
04:58:10.708 --> 04:58:10.718 align:start position:0%
have one captain um
 
04:58:13.430 --> 04:58:13.440 align:start position:0%
you mentioned renewal registrations only
 
04:58:15.590 --> 04:58:15.600 align:start position:0%
but when i read the amendment it just
 
04:58:15.600 --> 04:58:16.470 align:start position:0%
but when i read the amendment it just
says

04:58:16.470 --> 04:58:16.480 align:start position:0%
says
 
04:58:19.750 --> 04:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
fines or registration fees
 
04:58:22.230 --> 04:58:22.240 align:start position:0%
but you would like this only for renewal
 
04:58:22.240 --> 04:58:24.708 align:start position:0%
but you would like this only for renewal
registration

04:58:24.708 --> 04:58:24.718 align:start position:0%
registration
 
04:58:27.350 --> 04:58:27.360 align:start position:0%
ins once again in speaking with my

licensing division registration division
 
04:58:32.230 --> 04:58:32.240 align:start position:0%
um and speaking with you know the
 
04:58:34.470 --> 04:58:34.480 align:start position:0%
director motor vehicle that's that's the
 
04:58:36.550 --> 04:58:36.560 align:start position:0%
way we would foresee it is that the
 
04:58:38.788 --> 04:58:38.798 align:start position:0%
similar program as to motor vehicle that
 
04:58:40.868 --> 04:58:40.878 align:start position:0%
it would be a renewal
 
04:58:43.030 --> 04:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
program um
 
04:58:45.030 --> 04:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
just because once again we we need to
 
04:58:47.830 --> 04:58:47.840 align:start position:0%
make sure that vin numbers and and um
 
04:58:49.910 --> 04:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
you know registrations are are you know
 
04:58:50.948 --> 04:58:50.958 align:start position:0%

that everything's filled out
appropriately

04:58:52.230 --> 04:58:52.240 align:start position:0%

program in 2018
 
04:59:40.230 --> 04:59:40.240 align:start position:0%

memberships online uh each year
and

04:59:44.868 --> 04:59:44.878 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:59:46.948 --> 04:59:46.958 align:start position:0%
it's been a little embarrassing
 
04:59:50.390 --> 04:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
that uh online people can join a club
 
04:59:53.190 --> 04:59:53.200 align:start position:0%
but yet they can't register their ohrv
 
04:59:53.200 --> 04:59:54.628 align:start position:0%
but yet they can't register their ohrv
online

04:59:54.628 --> 04:59:54.638 align:start position:0%
online
 
04:59:57.110 --> 04:59:57.120 align:start position:0%
i understand initial registrations takes
 
04:59:59.910 --> 04:59:59.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of information to put in and
 
05:00:01.270 --> 05:00:01.280 align:start position:0%
we certainly
 
05:00:02.788 --> 05:00:02.798 align:start position:0%
agree that it should only be the
 
05:00:07.110 --> 05:00:07.120 align:start position:0%
renewals to keep the data pure
 
05:00:07.120 --> 05:00:07.910 align:start position:0%
renewals to keep the data pure
and

05:00:07.910 --> 05:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:00:11.510 --> 05:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
fully support it with the amendment to
 
05:00:15.750 --> 05:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
put it out until july 1st 2024

to both clarify renewals as well as
 
05:01:12.788 --> 05:01:12.798 align:start position:0%
extend that timeline we've had multiple

and i think we're all we're all in
 
05:01:23.360 --> 05:01:24.550 align:start position:0%
and i think we're all we're all in
agreement

05:01:24.550 --> 05:01:24.560 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
05:01:27.110 --> 05:01:27.120 align:start position:0%
a dual system is necessary immediate on
 
05:01:29.430 --> 05:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
the spot registration for ohrv
 
05:01:31.430 --> 05:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
snowmobiles atvs
 
05:01:33.110 --> 05:01:33.120 align:start position:0%
whether it's last-minute decisions to
 
05:01:34.230 --> 05:01:34.240 align:start position:0%
come to the fishing derby because
 
05:01:35.830 --> 05:01:35.840 align:start position:0%
there's actually ice when no one thought
 
05:01:36.868 --> 05:01:36.878 align:start position:0%
there was
 
05:01:38.788 --> 05:01:38.798 align:start position:0%
a storm happens to track a little more
 
05:01:38.798 --> 05:01:39.990 align:start position:0%
a storm happens to track a little more
northwest

05:01:39.990 --> 05:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
northwest
 
05:01:41.830 --> 05:01:41.840 align:start position:0%
than people thought and on friday night
 
05:01:43.510 --> 05:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
they're lined up at the snowmobile
 
05:01:44.550 --> 05:01:44.560 align:start position:0%
dealer in concord to get their
 
05:01:46.150 --> 05:01:46.160 align:start position:0%
registrations because you could actually
 
05:01:47.750 --> 05:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
ride in merrimack county on a saturday
 
05:01:48.708 --> 05:01:48.718 align:start position:0%
when you didn't think you were supposed
 
05:01:50.948 --> 05:01:50.958 align:start position:0%
to be able to so a dual system is
 
05:01:50.958 --> 05:01:52.230 align:start position:0%
to be able to so a dual system is
necessary

05:01:52.230 --> 05:01:52.240 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
05:01:54.310 --> 05:01:54.320 align:start position:0%
we agree also as what captain eastman
 
05:01:55.590 --> 05:01:55.600 align:start position:0%
referred to
 
05:01:58.150 --> 05:01:58.160 align:start position:0%
that initial check of the individual is
 
05:02:00.070 --> 05:02:00.080 align:start position:0%
who they are they're registering
 
05:02:02.470 --> 05:02:02.480 align:start position:0%
accurate units that they do in fact have
 
05:02:03.830 --> 05:02:03.840 align:start position:0%
a club membership if that's what they're
 
05:02:07.350 --> 05:02:07.360 align:start position:0%
going for so renewals is a great idea
 
05:02:08.788 --> 05:02:08.798 align:start position:0%
i have
 
05:02:11.110 --> 05:02:11.120 align:start position:0%
a handout that i'll pass to the
 
05:02:13.510 --> 05:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
committee and it does in fact include
 
05:02:15.590 --> 05:02:15.600 align:start position:0%
our suggestion um
 
05:02:18.310 --> 05:02:18.320 align:start position:0%
and it's one word simply repeated two
 
05:02:21.510 --> 05:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
times and it's renewals uh just right in
 
05:02:24.070 --> 05:02:24.080 align:start position:0%
front of uh the registration fee um
 
05:02:26.070 --> 05:02:26.080 align:start position:0%
that's proposed so you can see it it's
 
05:02:28.550 --> 05:02:28.560 align:start position:0%
it's highlighted there um
 
05:02:31.110 --> 05:02:31.120 align:start position:0%
so with that being said um those two
 
05:02:33.110 --> 05:02:33.120 align:start position:0%
quick amendments to the bill and we are
 
05:02:35.750 --> 05:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
supportive of this um it is a great way
 
05:02:37.750 --> 05:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
to move forward uh it'll be great
 
05:02:39.910 --> 05:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
customer service especially for some of
 
05:02:41.430 --> 05:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
our out-of-state folks who know they're
 
05:02:43.030 --> 05:02:43.040 align:start position:0%
coming up from rhode island two weeks in
 
05:02:44.708 --> 05:02:44.718 align:start position:0%
early two weeks in advance they can
 
05:02:45.830 --> 05:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
register their units get them in the
 
05:02:47.030 --> 05:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
mail and then they're ready to ride when
 
05:02:48.948 --> 05:02:48.958 align:start position:0%
they get here so
 
05:02:50.550 --> 05:02:50.560 align:start position:0%
it's a great idea and it's a great
 
05:02:53.430 --> 05:02:53.440 align:start position:0%
forward moving program so with that i'll
 
05:02:55.030 --> 05:02:55.040 align:start position:0%
take any questions if there are any
 
05:02:57.030 --> 05:02:57.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr bennett any questions for
 
05:03:00.470 --> 05:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:02.150 --> 05:03:02.160 align:start position:0%

05:03:05.910 --> 05:03:05.920 align:start position:0%

05:03:17.830 --> 05:03:17.840 align:start position:0%
maybe with amendment i think
 
05:03:19.750 --> 05:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
mr labrie
 
05:03:21.510 --> 05:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
05:03:23.670 --> 05:03:23.680 align:start position:0%
um these guys have said it
 
05:03:24.948 --> 05:03:24.958 align:start position:0%
in front in front of that came in front
 
05:03:26.150 --> 05:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
of me um
 
05:03:28.070 --> 05:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
we do believe that it's it's important
 
05:03:29.670 --> 05:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
to have an online registration presence
 
05:03:31.110 --> 05:03:31.120 align:start position:0%
here in the state
 
05:03:32.708 --> 05:03:32.718 align:start position:0%

05:03:35.670 --> 05:03:35.680 align:start position:0%
left right north and south seem to have
 
05:03:37.110 --> 05:03:37.120 align:start position:0%
this we don't
 
05:03:38.628 --> 05:03:38.638 align:start position:0%
i think if we could come in line with
 
05:03:40.070 --> 05:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
the times it would it would certainly
 
05:03:40.080 --> 05:03:41.110 align:start position:0%
the times it would it would certainly
help

05:03:41.110 --> 05:03:41.120 align:start position:0%
help
 
05:03:43.030 --> 05:03:43.040 align:start position:0%
grow registrations in the state and
 
05:03:46.788 --> 05:03:46.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:48.628 --> 05:03:48.638 align:start position:0%
the sooner the better is our opinion on
 
05:03:50.390 --> 05:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
this we do realize that there's a
 
05:03:51.910 --> 05:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
timeline and a platform change coming
 
05:03:53.590 --> 05:03:53.600 align:start position:0%
from fish and game which we are good
 
05:03:53.600 --> 05:03:54.390 align:start position:0%
from fish and game which we are good
with

05:03:54.390 --> 05:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:03:56.230 --> 05:03:56.240 align:start position:0%
so we are in 100
 
05:03:58.470 --> 05:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
agreement with the bill as written i
 
05:04:00.230 --> 05:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
think they just needed me one amendment
 
05:04:00.240 --> 05:04:01.510 align:start position:0%
think they just needed me one amendment
and

05:04:01.510 --> 05:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:04:04.708 --> 05:04:04.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:06.948 --> 05:04:06.958 align:start position:0%
just so i can clarify or you can clarify
 
05:04:09.110 --> 05:04:09.120 align:start position:0%
mr labrie you're in favor of the bill as
 
05:04:12.788 --> 05:04:12.798 align:start position:0%
amended with the renewals put in also
 
05:04:15.030 --> 05:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
we would like to
 
05:04:17.270 --> 05:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
i guess
 
05:04:18.948 --> 05:04:18.958 align:start position:0%
investigate the renewal component a
 
05:04:20.150 --> 05:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
little bit more
 
05:04:22.310 --> 05:04:22.320 align:start position:0%
uh we can speak offline with that with
 
05:04:23.830 --> 05:04:23.840 align:start position:0%
the representative
 
05:04:26.390 --> 05:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
we are in favor on 100 of online
 
05:04:26.400 --> 05:04:28.390 align:start position:0%
we are in favor on 100 of online
registrations

05:04:28.390 --> 05:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
registrations
 
05:04:30.550 --> 05:04:30.560 align:start position:0%
we would like to investigate
 
05:04:31.670 --> 05:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
a little bit
 
05:04:31.680 --> 05:04:32.390 align:start position:0%
a little bit
more

05:04:32.390 --> 05:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
more
 
05:04:34.070 --> 05:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
renewals versus
 
05:04:35.830 --> 05:04:35.840 align:start position:0%
initial registrations we understand the
 
05:04:37.990 --> 05:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
reasoning behind it for verification
 
05:04:38.000 --> 05:04:39.510 align:start position:0%
reasoning behind it for verification
purposes

05:04:39.510 --> 05:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
05:04:41.430 --> 05:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's not easy to do that
 
05:04:41.440 --> 05:04:45.510 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's not easy to do that
registration

05:04:45.510 --> 05:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:47.590 --> 05:04:47.600 align:start position:0%
i guess in a ahead of time like like the
 
05:04:49.430 --> 05:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
previous gentleman stated that it's
 
05:04:51.270 --> 05:04:51.280 align:start position:0%
important that when these lines build at
 
05:04:53.030 --> 05:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
these these dealers sometimes it takes
 
05:04:54.708 --> 05:04:54.718 align:start position:0%
away from that dealer
 
05:04:57.270 --> 05:04:57.280 align:start position:0%
uh performing their other clerical tasks
 
05:04:59.350 --> 05:04:59.360 align:start position:0%
helping other customers out so
 
05:05:01.430 --> 05:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
if you have to verify all of these
 
05:05:03.030 --> 05:05:03.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's uh
 
05:05:03.040 --> 05:05:04.390 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's uh
taxing

05:05:04.390 --> 05:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
taxing
 
05:05:08.310 --> 05:05:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:09.990 --> 05:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
05:05:11.510 --> 05:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:05:13.190 --> 05:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
is there anyone that wants to speak that
 
05:05:20.070 --> 05:05:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:22.070 --> 05:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
no more pink cards captain eastman would
 
05:05:24.150 --> 05:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
you mind coming forward again one of the
 
05:05:26.230 --> 05:05:26.240 align:start position:0%
representatives has another question for
 
05:05:29.030 --> 05:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
you if you'll take it representative
 
05:05:29.040 --> 05:05:30.550 align:start position:0%
you if you'll take it representative
smith

05:05:30.550 --> 05:05:30.560 align:start position:0%
smith
 
05:05:32.868 --> 05:05:32.878 align:start position:0%
thank you captain eastman um all this
 
05:05:36.470 --> 05:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
talk of uh registrations um but i do
 
05:05:39.030 --> 05:05:39.040 align:start position:0%
note that it also the bill also calls
 
05:05:41.670 --> 05:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
for the paying of fines online
 
05:05:44.550 --> 05:05:44.560 align:start position:0%
is that uh is there any issue with that
 
05:05:46.310 --> 05:05:46.320 align:start position:0%
or is that something that's easier to
 
05:05:49.030 --> 05:05:49.040 align:start position:0%
deal with than registrations
 
05:05:51.510 --> 05:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
the issue that uh that we have with
 
05:05:54.230 --> 05:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
paying fines um and i think this
 
05:05:56.628 --> 05:05:56.638 align:start position:0%
and i can't speak to um to this side i
 
05:05:59.430 --> 05:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
guess of of the intent but i think it
 
05:06:01.350 --> 05:06:01.360 align:start position:0%
was intense for us to
 
05:06:04.230 --> 05:06:04.240 align:start position:0%
we go through issues with right now um
 
05:06:06.550 --> 05:06:06.560 align:start position:0%
when a violation is
 
05:06:08.868 --> 05:06:08.878 align:start position:0%
submit or is issued that's it's
 
05:06:10.868 --> 05:06:10.878 align:start position:0%
basically handled by the court
 
05:06:12.708 --> 05:06:12.718 align:start position:0%
in the court system having difficulty
 
05:06:15.350 --> 05:06:15.360 align:start position:0%
that it is now is that we um
 
05:06:17.190 --> 05:06:17.200 align:start position:0%
you know we don't believe that some of
 
05:06:19.910 --> 05:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
the funds um just getting back some some
 
05:06:21.830 --> 05:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
of the notifications um has been
 
05:06:24.310 --> 05:06:24.320 align:start position:0%
difficult um so this would certainly
 
05:06:25.590 --> 05:06:25.600 align:start position:0%
help us
 
05:06:25.600 --> 05:06:26.310 align:start position:0%
help us
but

05:06:26.310 --> 05:06:26.320 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:06:28.310 --> 05:06:28.320 align:start position:0%
this is a this is a criminal i think
 
05:06:30.310 --> 05:06:30.320 align:start position:0%
we'd you know we'd have to look at it a
 
05:06:32.868 --> 05:06:32.878 align:start position:0%
lot more before we um
 
05:06:34.868 --> 05:06:34.878 align:start position:0%
made that change you know possibly
 
05:06:36.708 --> 05:06:36.718 align:start position:0%
decriminalizing some things making them
 
05:06:38.868 --> 05:06:38.878 align:start position:0%
civil um and then there would be a lot
 
05:06:41.110 --> 05:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
more that that like hearings officers
 
05:06:42.390 --> 05:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
and things like that we would have to
 
05:06:45.430 --> 05:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
look into so um you know once again uh i
 
05:06:48.708 --> 05:06:48.718 align:start position:0%
think that portion of this bill for us
 
05:06:50.550 --> 05:06:50.560 align:start position:0%
we would need to look at it a lot more
 
05:06:52.628 --> 05:06:52.638 align:start position:0%
before um you know we'd have to oppose
 
05:06:54.070 --> 05:06:54.080 align:start position:0%
it this time and have to look at it a
 
05:06:55.910 --> 05:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
lot more before we said we could
 
05:06:58.070 --> 05:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
actually you know take on that part of
 
05:06:58.080 --> 05:07:00.868 align:start position:0%
actually you know take on that part of
it

05:07:00.868 --> 05:07:00.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:03.670 --> 05:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
so the bill the the law that we passed a
 
05:07:05.270 --> 05:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
couple of years ago three years ago
 
05:07:08.310 --> 05:07:08.320 align:start position:0%
maybe increasing the fines
 
05:07:11.510 --> 05:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
and so as far as i don't know if we
 
05:07:13.110 --> 05:07:13.120 align:start position:0%
changed them from violations to
 
05:07:14.708 --> 05:07:14.718 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors or if they were always
 
05:07:16.948 --> 05:07:16.958 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors but is that something that
 
05:07:18.150 --> 05:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
would need to come back to the
 
05:07:20.390 --> 05:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
legislature to approve if you were
 
05:07:23.590 --> 05:07:23.600 align:start position:0%
changing the class of the
 
05:07:25.990 --> 05:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
of the violation
 
05:07:27.510 --> 05:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
certainly the increase in the fee has
 
05:07:29.430 --> 05:07:29.440 align:start position:0%
not has it was not the issue that
 
05:07:31.030 --> 05:07:31.040 align:start position:0%
certainly i think helped out in a lot of
 
05:07:33.430 --> 05:07:33.440 align:start position:0%
areas especially off trail writing and
 
05:07:34.948 --> 05:07:34.958 align:start position:0%
registrations and things of that nature
 
05:07:37.350 --> 05:07:37.360 align:start position:0%
in my opinion um
 
05:07:39.910 --> 05:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not you know once again i i don't
 
05:07:41.910 --> 05:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if you know decriminalizing
 
05:07:43.750 --> 05:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
making thing you know making certain
 
05:07:46.788 --> 05:07:46.798 align:start position:0%
violate are certain statutes civil so
 
05:07:48.550 --> 05:07:48.560 align:start position:0%
therefore we could have an internal
 
05:07:50.390 --> 05:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
collection of fees and
 
05:07:54.470 --> 05:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
and um hearings in-house or you know
 
05:07:55.590 --> 05:07:55.600 align:start position:0%
right now
 
05:07:57.750 --> 05:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
for instance you know with with motor
 
05:08:00.230 --> 05:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
vehicle tickets um if you issue a ticket
 
05:08:01.510 --> 05:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
it goes straight to the department of
 
05:08:03.350 --> 05:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle and then if someone
 
05:08:04.868 --> 05:08:04.878 align:start position:0%
decides that they want to have a trial
 
05:08:06.230 --> 05:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
on that then
 
05:08:08.550 --> 05:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
you know whomever is collecting that
 
05:08:11.270 --> 05:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
that you know ticket at motor vehicle
 
05:08:13.030 --> 05:08:13.040 align:start position:0%
then you know makes contact with the
 
05:08:14.948 --> 05:08:14.958 align:start position:0%
court it basically takes a lot of the
 
05:08:18.390 --> 05:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
court portion of it out and is just the
 
05:08:20.788 --> 05:08:20.798 align:start position:0%
the uh the
 
05:08:22.230 --> 05:08:22.240 align:start position:0%
person calling the court saying this
 
05:08:23.910 --> 05:08:23.920 align:start position:0%
person wants a trial and they set it up
 
05:08:25.670 --> 05:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
and then they send that to the person so
 
05:08:28.230 --> 05:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
i i'm not sure which one would be better
 
05:08:30.470 --> 05:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
for us and i think you know
 
05:08:32.390 --> 05:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
our commission or my commission and
 
05:08:34.150 --> 05:08:34.160 align:start position:0%
director you know taking a look at that
 
05:08:38.070 --> 05:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
would be would be better okay thank you
 
05:08:39.750 --> 05:08:39.760 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the captain
 
05:08:42.390 --> 05:08:42.400 align:start position:0%
before we release him
 
05:08:43.990 --> 05:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
representative mayville then
 
05:08:46.708 --> 05:08:46.718 align:start position:0%
representative creighton
 
05:08:48.150 --> 05:08:48.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
05:08:49.830 --> 05:08:49.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question i might have missed
 
05:08:52.628 --> 05:08:52.638 align:start position:0%
it did you mention the number of initial
 
05:08:55.670 --> 05:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
registrations versus the renewals
 
05:08:59.670 --> 05:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
do you have an idea is it per annual or
 
05:09:01.990 --> 05:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
registrations are very predicated on
 
05:09:03.910 --> 05:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
weather so saying you know what's new
 
05:09:06.708 --> 05:09:06.718 align:start position:0%
obviously um
 
05:09:06.718 --> 05:09:07.910 align:start position:0%
obviously um
with

05:09:07.910 --> 05:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:09:10.470 --> 05:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
with inventory right now
 
05:09:12.788 --> 05:09:12.798 align:start position:0%
you know certainly there aren't a lot of
 
05:09:14.628 --> 05:09:14.638 align:start position:0%
new registrations i'm kind of guessing
 
05:09:15.830 --> 05:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
i'm seeing we're seeing a lot of
 
05:09:17.910 --> 05:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
registrations but to say you know these
 
05:09:19.670 --> 05:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
are brand new machines they might be
 
05:09:22.708 --> 05:09:22.718 align:start position:0%
brand new owners um but i don't think
 
05:09:24.788 --> 05:09:24.798 align:start position:0%
that i i can't give you like a real
 
05:09:27.510 --> 05:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
number on what how many are brand new
 
05:09:27.520 --> 05:09:30.788 align:start position:0%
number on what how many are brand new
um

05:09:30.788 --> 05:09:30.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:32.470 --> 05:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
i i mean i get all the pa you know it's
 
05:09:35.430 --> 05:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
it it really all depends um and then
 
05:09:37.990 --> 05:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
ohrv is once again you know it's there's
 
05:09:40.390 --> 05:09:40.400 align:start position:0%
a trend from four wheelers to side by
 
05:09:42.230 --> 05:09:42.240 align:start position:0%
side so you know there might be more
 
05:09:45.750 --> 05:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
that are from one year to the next
 
05:09:49.030 --> 05:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:51.750 --> 05:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you mr chairman uh kevin
 
05:09:52.948 --> 05:09:52.958 align:start position:0%
smith the
 
05:09:54.708 --> 05:09:54.718 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to clarify what i've
 
05:09:56.390 --> 05:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
heard because i think
 
05:09:57.670 --> 05:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
what you just said is different than
 
05:09:59.270 --> 05:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
what we've been talking about
 
05:09:59.280 --> 05:10:00.868 align:start position:0%
what we've been talking about
so

05:10:00.868 --> 05:10:00.878 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:10:03.590 --> 05:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
you're saying that you can't do fine
 
05:10:05.190 --> 05:10:05.200 align:start position:0%
that this bill says
 
05:10:07.670 --> 05:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
payment of any fines or registration
 
05:10:07.680 --> 05:10:08.708 align:start position:0%
payment of any fines or registration
fees

05:10:08.708 --> 05:10:08.718 align:start position:0%
fees
 
05:10:09.830 --> 05:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
and everyone has talked about
 
05:10:12.948 --> 05:10:12.958 align:start position:0%
registration fees roger i got that
 
05:10:14.788 --> 05:10:14.798 align:start position:0%
but fines you say
 
05:10:17.190 --> 05:10:17.200 align:start position:0%
is going to be more difficult based upon
 
05:10:19.350 --> 05:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
your description that you just did
 
05:10:19.360 --> 05:10:20.948 align:start position:0%
your description that you just did
so

05:10:20.948 --> 05:10:20.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:10:22.550 --> 05:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
my question is does fish and game
 
05:10:24.230 --> 05:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
support this
 
05:10:26.230 --> 05:10:26.240 align:start position:0%
bill as written
 
05:10:29.590 --> 05:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
or does it support this bill
 
05:10:31.110 --> 05:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
with an amendment that would take out
 
05:10:36.150 --> 05:10:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:38.390 --> 05:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
i think the what we've looked at the
 
05:10:40.310 --> 05:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
majority we looked at is the registry
 
05:10:41.910 --> 05:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
online registration and that's what
 
05:10:43.110 --> 05:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
you've heard today
 
05:10:45.430 --> 05:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
uh you know as far as the fines portion
 
05:10:48.070 --> 05:10:48.080 align:start position:0%
of it i i once again we're not
 
05:10:50.310 --> 05:10:50.320 align:start position:0%
i think it's it would be better for us
 
05:10:52.628 --> 05:10:52.638 align:start position:0%
to look at which which option the two
 
05:10:54.708 --> 05:10:54.718 align:start position:0%
that i laid out will be better for the
 
05:10:56.868 --> 05:10:56.878 align:start position:0%
department um so
 
05:10:59.110 --> 05:10:59.120 align:start position:0%
that portion of it i would say
 
05:11:01.750 --> 05:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
we're you know we certainly at some
 
05:11:03.670 --> 05:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
point i think would like to do that i'm
 
05:11:06.070 --> 05:11:06.080 align:start position:0%
not sure that we're there yet for me if
 
05:11:07.350 --> 05:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
that were to be
 
05:11:10.310 --> 05:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
um studied a little bit more internally
 
05:11:15.110 --> 05:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:16.788 --> 05:11:16.798 align:start position:0%
no follow-up thank you
 
05:11:19.270 --> 05:11:19.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:11:20.948 --> 05:11:20.958 align:start position:0%
so captain eastman i have a question
 
05:11:23.350 --> 05:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
just to try to clarify that so if the
 
05:11:25.830 --> 05:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
bill was written and amended again to
 
05:11:27.430 --> 05:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
just say
 
05:11:30.390 --> 05:11:30.400 align:start position:0%
we'll set up online payment for renewal
 
05:11:32.550 --> 05:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
registrations that's basically what
 
05:11:34.708 --> 05:11:34.718 align:start position:0%
you're in favor of today
 
05:11:38.070 --> 05:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
just renewal registrations
 
05:11:42.868 --> 05:11:42.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:44.628 --> 05:11:44.638 align:start position:0%
i would agree with that
 
05:11:47.190 --> 05:11:47.200 align:start position:0%
i would add that if if it were so the
 
05:11:49.830 --> 05:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
desire of the committee to say that that
 
05:11:52.070 --> 05:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
um that we would
 
05:11:55.590 --> 05:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
continue to look at the fine collection
 
05:11:56.868 --> 05:11:56.878 align:start position:0%
portion of it
 
05:11:59.670 --> 05:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
either online or or just internally i
 
05:12:01.350 --> 05:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
mean i would certainly i believe my
 
05:12:02.788 --> 05:12:02.798 align:start position:0%
commission would be in favor of that as
 
05:12:04.788 --> 05:12:04.798 align:start position:0%
well okay thank you
 
05:12:08.470 --> 05:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
any other questions for captain eastman
 
05:12:10.868 --> 05:12:10.878 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you captain
 
05:12:15.350 --> 05:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
representative post yes thank you um
 
05:12:17.830 --> 05:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
my question is um
 
05:12:20.310 --> 05:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
05:12:23.990 --> 05:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
is unapproved so this could just be
 
05:12:24.000 --> 05:12:25.190 align:start position:0%
is unapproved so this could just be
changed

05:12:25.190 --> 05:12:25.200 align:start position:0%
changed
 
05:12:25.200 --> 05:12:26.628 align:start position:0%
changed
correct

05:12:26.628 --> 05:12:26.638 align:start position:0%
correct
 
05:12:29.510 --> 05:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
it's not a okay
 
05:12:32.230 --> 05:12:32.240 align:start position:0%
and and as far as the
 
05:12:33.830 --> 05:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
fines go
 
05:12:35.830 --> 05:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
it sounds like you really want to keep
 
05:12:37.030 --> 05:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
it in there
 
05:12:40.310 --> 05:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
but this would really end up being
 
05:12:43.030 --> 05:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
an amendment in the future to this bill
 
05:12:48.470 --> 05:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:49.990 --> 05:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
the question should be directed to
 
05:12:52.708 --> 05:12:52.718 align:start position:0%
forecast captain eastman not to the
 
05:12:54.788 --> 05:12:54.798 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill so i'm going to rule
 
05:12:57.430 --> 05:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
that question you can get that answer
 
05:12:59.350 --> 05:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
later from the sponsor or an executive
 
05:13:01.750 --> 05:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
session but um do you have a question
 
05:13:04.470 --> 05:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
you want to direct to captain eastman
 
05:13:06.948 --> 05:13:06.958 align:start position:0%
no that that's fine okay thank you sorry
 
05:13:08.470 --> 05:13:08.480 align:start position:0%

snowmobiles
 
05:46:49.990 --> 05:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
i found this bill because i know that
 
05:46:51.910 --> 05:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
fish and game department touches many
 
05:46:53.830 --> 05:46:53.840 align:start position:0%
new hampshire residents and visitors who
 
05:46:55.830 --> 05:46:55.840 align:start position:0%
are outdoor enthusiasts with motorized
 
05:46:58.628 --> 05:46:58.638 align:start position:0%
vehicles and they enjoy all four seasons
 
05:47:01.270 --> 05:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
that our state can offer them
 
05:47:03.190 --> 05:47:03.200 align:start position:0%
and the ability to have riders be better
 
05:47:05.430 --> 05:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
prepared while riding on new trails or
 
05:47:07.830 --> 05:47:07.840 align:start position:0%
in new riding territories is essential
 
05:47:09.590 --> 05:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
to helping fish and game manage their
 
05:47:09.600 --> 05:47:10.708 align:start position:0%
to helping fish and game manage their
ridership

05:47:10.708 --> 05:47:10.718 align:start position:0%
ridership
 
05:47:12.628 --> 05:47:12.638 align:start position:0%
a safety program will go a long way in
 
05:47:14.788 --> 05:47:14.798 align:start position:0%
serving the community of writers with
 
05:47:17.590 --> 05:47:17.600 align:start position:0%
increased safety and education this bill
 
05:47:19.910 --> 05:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
was was developed in consultation with
 
05:47:21.430 --> 05:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
the law enforcement division of fish and
 
05:47:23.270 --> 05:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
game as well as with the new hampshire
 
05:47:25.430 --> 05:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
rhiv association and new hampshire
 
05:47:27.430 --> 05:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
snowmobile association
 
05:47:28.788 --> 05:47:28.798 align:start position:0%
from my point of view
 
05:47:30.548 --> 05:47:30.558 align:start position:0%
i feel we require safety training
 
05:47:33.190 --> 05:47:33.200 align:start position:0%
courses in new hampshire to drive a boat
 
05:47:36.150 --> 05:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
ride a motorcycle or use a hunting rifle
 
05:47:38.310 --> 05:47:38.320 align:start position:0%
as these tracing courses protect our
 
05:47:39.990 --> 05:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
state residents and our visitors that
 
05:47:42.548 --> 05:47:42.558 align:start position:0%
come to enjoy those activities with the
 
05:47:44.470 --> 05:47:44.480 align:start position:0%
weight of an atv or a side by side
 
05:47:47.750 --> 05:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
ranging from 500 to 1500 pounds with the
 
05:47:49.670 --> 05:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
weight of a snowmobile ranging from 400
 
05:47:52.310 --> 05:47:52.320 align:start position:0%
to 600 pounds and these machines moving
 
05:47:55.430 --> 05:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
at an estimated speed of 30 or 40 up to
 
05:47:57.430 --> 05:47:57.440 align:start position:0%
80 miles an hour these vehicles can be
 
05:47:59.110 --> 05:47:59.120 align:start position:0%
really fun but they can also be
 
05:48:00.948 --> 05:48:00.958 align:start position:0%
potentially dangerous and recently
 
05:48:02.868 --> 05:48:02.878 align:start position:0%
you've seen in the last year or so
 
05:48:05.750 --> 05:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
accidents by new atv and some will be
 
05:48:08.390 --> 05:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
riders and one that even seriously
 
05:48:09.910 --> 05:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
injured one of our fish and game
 
05:48:12.310 --> 05:48:12.320 align:start position:0%
conservation officers
 
05:48:13.750 --> 05:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
while many writers have established
 
05:48:15.910 --> 05:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
themselves as responsible knowledgeable
 
05:48:17.590 --> 05:48:17.600 align:start position:0%
and cooperative because they're a member
 
05:48:19.590 --> 05:48:19.600 align:start position:0%
of a club or an organization
 
05:48:21.270 --> 05:48:21.280 align:start position:0%
and i thank those clubs and community
 
05:48:23.510 --> 05:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
organizations for driving that logic
 
05:48:25.510 --> 05:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
we also know that new writers and young
 
05:48:27.110 --> 05:48:27.120 align:start position:0%
writers are the ones that are most at
 
05:48:29.430 --> 05:48:29.440 align:start position:0%
risk this bill creates an opportunity
 
05:48:31.270 --> 05:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
for people to learn the rules and follow
 
05:48:33.110 --> 05:48:33.120 align:start position:0%
the rules in building more right or
 
05:48:34.948 --> 05:48:34.958 align:start position:0%
respect for their communities the
 
05:48:36.948 --> 05:48:36.958 align:start position:0%
communities that they ride in and around
 
05:48:39.670 --> 05:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
and amongst most of our trail systems in
 
05:48:41.430 --> 05:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
new hampshire as we know run through
 
05:48:43.110 --> 05:48:43.120 align:start position:0%
easements that are granted by private
 
05:48:45.510 --> 05:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
landowners a safety training program
 
05:48:47.270 --> 05:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
allows fish and game to safeguard the
 
05:48:48.628 --> 05:48:48.638 align:start position:0%
trail system
 
05:48:52.230 --> 05:48:52.240 align:start position:0%
all riders currently enjoy
 
05:48:53.910 --> 05:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
the bill is important in supporting our
 
05:48:55.830 --> 05:48:55.840 align:start position:0%
valuable tourism economy easing the
 
05:48:57.350 --> 05:48:57.360 align:start position:0%
burden of law enforcement and public
 
05:48:59.990 --> 05:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
safety modernizing our education process
 
05:49:02.230 --> 05:49:02.240 align:start position:0%
for the growing ohrville and snowmobile
 
05:49:03.750 --> 05:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
ridership and supporting our
 
05:49:06.868 --> 05:49:06.878 align:start position:0%
understaffed fish and game department
 
05:49:08.708 --> 05:49:08.718 align:start position:0%
this is not necessarily a simple bill
 
05:49:10.708 --> 05:49:10.718 align:start position:0%
but one that's valuable that can help
 
05:49:12.548 --> 05:49:12.558 align:start position:0%
conservation officers while having a
 
05:49:14.470 --> 05:49:14.480 align:start position:0%
tremendous positive impact on new
 
05:49:16.310 --> 05:49:16.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire residents and the visitors who
 
05:49:18.548 --> 05:49:18.558 align:start position:0%
come to enjoy the mountains woods lakes
 
05:49:21.590 --> 05:49:21.600 align:start position:0%
streams and trails i feel it is enabling
 
05:49:23.190 --> 05:49:23.200 align:start position:0%
legislation done
 
05:49:24.788 --> 05:49:24.798 align:start position:0%
importantly in consultation with fish
 
05:49:27.350 --> 05:49:27.360 align:start position:0%
and game and those member associations
 
05:49:29.430 --> 05:49:29.440 align:start position:0%
in the communities that they serve but i
 
05:49:32.708 --> 05:49:32.718 align:start position:0%
also know in consulting with them that
 
05:49:34.390 --> 05:49:34.400 align:start position:0%
there are still a few things about this
 
05:49:36.628 --> 05:49:36.638 align:start position:0%
bill that need to be worked on and i
 
05:49:38.548 --> 05:49:38.558 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that we limit the
 
05:49:40.628 --> 05:49:40.638 align:start position:0%
financial impact on writers and the
 
05:49:43.910 --> 05:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
agency in terms of safety training class
 
05:49:46.830 --> 05:49:46.840 align:start position:0%
fees as well as
 
05:49:46.840 --> 05:49:48.788 align:start position:0%
fees as well as
other

05:49:48.788 --> 05:49:48.798 align:start position:0%
other
 
05:49:50.868 --> 05:49:50.878 align:start position:0%
important factors that go into
 
05:49:50.878 --> 05:49:52.868 align:start position:0%
important factors that go into
evaluating

05:49:52.868 --> 05:49:52.878 align:start position:0%
evaluating
 
05:49:55.350 --> 05:49:55.360 align:start position:0%
what levels of ridership need to get
 
05:49:58.230 --> 05:49:58.240 align:start position:0%
trained so i while i am bringing this
 
05:50:00.470 --> 05:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
bill forward i'm also asking that the
 
05:50:00.480 --> 05:50:01.430 align:start position:0%
bill forward i'm also asking that the
committee

05:50:01.430 --> 05:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:50:03.190 --> 05:50:03.200 align:start position:0%
consider it during executive session for
 
05:50:06.310 --> 05:50:06.320 align:start position:0%
interim study as well i'm also prepared
 
05:50:09.510 --> 05:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
um with a draft of a study committee if
 
05:50:11.110 --> 05:50:11.120 align:start position:0%
we want to discuss that in executive
 
05:50:12.788 --> 05:50:12.798 align:start position:0%
session because i think that if the
 
05:50:13.990 --> 05:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
committee feels that that might be a
 
05:50:16.470 --> 05:50:16.480 align:start position:0%
better direction but moreover a safety
 
05:50:17.990 --> 05:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
training program is something that the
 
05:50:20.868 --> 05:50:20.878 align:start position:0%
industry is asking for fish and game
 
05:50:23.990 --> 05:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
is asking for the community is needing
 
05:50:25.430 --> 05:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
and therefore i brought this bill
 
05:50:27.270 --> 05:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
forward for your consideration
 
05:50:29.030 --> 05:50:29.040 align:start position:0%

renting a
 
05:50:41.190 --> 05:50:41.200 align:start position:0%

05:50:52.788 --> 05:50:52.798 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
05:50:54.310 --> 05:50:54.320 align:start position:0%
bringing this bill forward could you
 
05:50:56.150 --> 05:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
just let us know how this would impact
 
05:51:00.310 --> 05:51:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:00.320 --> 05:51:01.510 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:51:01.510 --> 05:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:51:04.470 --> 05:51:04.480 align:start position:0%
like any other
 
05:51:06.390 --> 05:51:06.400 align:start position:0%
program where someone registers their
 
05:51:06.400 --> 05:51:07.990 align:start position:0%
program where someone registers their
vehicle

05:51:07.990 --> 05:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
05:51:10.150 --> 05:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
to be utilized in the state
 
05:51:12.628 --> 05:51:12.638 align:start position:0%
they would have uh
 
05:51:14.310 --> 05:51:14.320 align:start position:0%
if they're going to sorry if they're
 
05:51:15.510 --> 05:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
going to
 
05:51:17.430 --> 05:51:17.440 align:start position:0%
register their vehicle in this state
 
05:51:19.030 --> 05:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
because they have to do that if they're
 
05:51:20.470 --> 05:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
going to write even though they might
 
05:51:21.590 --> 05:51:21.600 align:start position:0%
live in another state they have to
 
05:51:23.270 --> 05:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
register for use in this state they
 
05:51:24.948 --> 05:51:24.958 align:start position:0%
would be required to have a safety
 
05:51:26.708 --> 05:51:26.718 align:start position:0%
training program an important factor
 
05:51:28.150 --> 05:51:28.160 align:start position:0%
that i want to make sure
 
05:51:29.910 --> 05:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
i do not leave out
 
05:51:32.708 --> 05:51:32.718 align:start position:0%
it is an um
 
05:51:34.070 --> 05:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
what's the right word i want to use a
 
05:51:36.788 --> 05:51:36.798 align:start position:0%
graduated program so those with more
 
05:51:39.510 --> 05:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
experience and more history
 
05:51:41.590 --> 05:51:41.600 align:start position:0%
could be grandfathered into the program
 
05:51:43.590 --> 05:51:43.600 align:start position:0%
and really it's weighted for those who
 
05:51:46.230 --> 05:51:46.240 align:start position:0%
are either new writers or younger
 
05:51:49.510 --> 05:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
writers so where experience and age
 
05:51:51.670 --> 05:51:51.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes is a detriment to us or who
 
05:51:53.750 --> 05:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
are older it is actually a benefit to
 
05:51:55.910 --> 05:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
those who are utilizing the safety
 
05:51:58.070 --> 05:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
training program because they will be
 
05:52:01.830 --> 05:52:01.840 align:start position:0%
considered having experience
 
05:52:01.840 --> 05:52:02.708 align:start position:0%
considered having experience
so

05:52:02.708 --> 05:52:02.718 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:52:04.310 --> 05:52:04.320 align:start position:0%
just to put a fine point on your
 
05:52:06.070 --> 05:52:06.080 align:start position:0%
question that
 
05:52:07.430 --> 05:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
while the
 
05:52:09.430 --> 05:52:09.440 align:start position:0%
folks still need to register their
 
05:52:11.990 --> 05:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
vehicle for their ohrv or snowmobile in
 
05:52:13.030 --> 05:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
this state
 
05:52:15.110 --> 05:52:15.120 align:start position:0%
um they would need to be utilized a
 
05:52:17.270 --> 05:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
safety training program again i'll also
 
05:52:19.910 --> 05:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
defer that i know um folks from fish and
 
05:52:21.270 --> 05:52:21.280 align:start position:0%
game will testify on this bill and
 
05:52:22.390 --> 05:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
they'll maybe
 
05:52:22.400 --> 05:52:23.750 align:start position:0%
they'll maybe
clarify

05:52:23.750 --> 05:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
05:52:26.788 --> 05:52:26.798 align:start position:0%
my answer for your question
 
05:52:26.798 --> 05:52:29.350 align:start position:0%
my answer for your question
representative

05:52:29.350 --> 05:52:29.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:52:31.910 --> 05:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman representative in
 
05:52:34.628 --> 05:52:34.638 align:start position:0%
the bill you have before
 
05:52:38.070 --> 05:52:38.080 align:start position:0%
born after 1 january 1968
 
05:52:38.080 --> 05:52:39.190 align:start position:0%
born after 1 january 1968
what

05:52:39.190 --> 05:52:39.200 align:start position:0%
what
 
05:52:42.150 --> 05:52:42.160 align:start position:0%
so if you're born before 68 what is that
 
05:52:43.750 --> 05:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
your grandfathered into it and you don't
 
05:52:46.150 --> 05:52:46.160 align:start position:0%
have to do it yeah i'm going to defer to
 
05:52:47.910 --> 05:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
captain eastman from fish and game uh
 
05:52:50.230 --> 05:52:50.240 align:start position:0%
who helped the particulars of creating
 
05:52:51.910 --> 05:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
this bill to make sure that it follows
 
05:52:55.590 --> 05:52:55.600 align:start position:0%
within fish and games existing rules of
 
05:52:56.948 --> 05:52:56.958 align:start position:0%
of um
 
05:53:00.548 --> 05:53:00.558 align:start position:0%
requiring age groups and who can be um
 
05:53:02.708 --> 05:53:02.718 align:start position:0%
who needs to have a older person writing
 
05:53:04.390 --> 05:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
with them if they're a younger person
 
05:53:07.910 --> 05:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:09.590 --> 05:53:09.600 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the
 
05:53:12.548 --> 05:53:12.558 align:start position:0%
representative representative cohen
 
05:53:15.030 --> 05:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
05:53:16.830 --> 05:53:16.840 align:start position:0%
on the section i just want a
 
05:53:18.868 --> 05:53:18.878 align:start position:0%
clarification on the section on
 
05:53:22.070 --> 05:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
snowmobile training it says that if a 12
 
05:53:24.868 --> 05:53:24.878 align:start position:0%
year old passes this test
 
05:53:27.510 --> 05:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
he or she is good for life as far as
 
05:53:29.990 --> 05:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
taking the safety with no renewal as
 
05:53:32.230 --> 05:53:32.240 align:start position:0%
they get more mature and older is that
 
05:53:36.310 --> 05:53:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:36.320 --> 05:53:38.230 align:start position:0%
 
i

05:53:38.230 --> 05:53:38.240 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:53:40.868 --> 05:53:40.878 align:start position:0%
um i'm i have to look at it
 
05:53:40.878 --> 05:53:44.788 align:start position:0%
um i'm i have to look at it
specifically

05:53:44.788 --> 05:53:44.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:46.150 --> 05:53:46.160 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna you know i'm gonna make my
 
05:53:47.990 --> 05:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
life easy and and be
 
05:53:50.548 --> 05:53:50.558 align:start position:0%
yours and be and defer to captain
 
05:53:52.070 --> 05:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
eastman in terms of the specific
 
05:53:54.310 --> 05:53:54.320 align:start position:0%
language on legalities
 
05:53:57.030 --> 05:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
follow-on question then please
 
05:53:59.110 --> 05:53:59.120 align:start position:0%
if a twelve-year-old
 
05:54:01.030 --> 05:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
and this may be need to be deferred to
 
05:54:02.390 --> 05:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
captain eastern as well ask you the
 
05:54:02.400 --> 05:54:03.190 align:start position:0%
captain eastern as well ask you the
question

05:54:03.190 --> 05:54:03.200 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:54:05.110 --> 05:54:05.120 align:start position:0%
if a 12 year old
 
05:54:06.868 --> 05:54:06.878 align:start position:0%
has a lifetime
 
05:54:10.150 --> 05:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
training certification for a snowmobile
 
05:54:12.868 --> 05:54:12.878 align:start position:0%
does this supersede any rules where a 12
 
05:54:14.788 --> 05:54:14.798 align:start position:0%
year old can't drive a
 
05:54:17.110 --> 05:54:17.120 align:start position:0%
snowmobile or can drive a snowmobile on
 
05:54:22.548 --> 05:54:22.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:23.750 --> 05:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
it may be
 
05:54:26.310 --> 05:54:26.320 align:start position:0%
again right it is
 
05:54:28.310 --> 05:54:28.320 align:start position:0%
my i'm happy to wait for captain eastman
 
05:54:30.628 --> 05:54:30.638 align:start position:0%
to attest and ask that question if the
 
05:54:32.310 --> 05:54:32.320 align:start position:0%
chair desires well that question for
 
05:54:35.190 --> 05:54:35.200 align:start position:0%
captain eastman thank you
 
05:54:36.390 --> 05:54:36.400 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the
 
05:54:36.400 --> 05:54:38.150 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the
representative

05:54:38.150 --> 05:54:38.160 align:start position:0%

seeing none thank you representative for
 
05:54:44.708 --> 05:54:44.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:46.708 --> 05:54:46.718 align:start position:0%
call forward representative dennis

i'm dennis thompson i represent co-ops
 
05:55:04.150 --> 05:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
district one
 
05:55:06.310 --> 05:55:06.320 align:start position:0%
which essentially is about a third of
 
05:55:08.470 --> 05:55:08.480 align:start position:0%
the top of the state of new hampshire
 
05:55:11.110 --> 05:55:11.120 align:start position:0%
and probably the largest area that we
 
05:55:13.270 --> 05:55:13.280 align:start position:0%
get snowmobiling and four-wheeling in in
 
05:55:14.948 --> 05:55:14.958 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire
 
05:55:17.910 --> 05:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
my basic concern up here is safety
 
05:55:20.070 --> 05:55:20.080 align:start position:0%
we have uh
 
05:55:20.080 --> 05:55:21.270 align:start position:0%
we have uh
i

05:55:21.270 --> 05:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:55:24.390 --> 05:55:24.400 align:start position:0%
took out some articles uh today
 
05:55:27.110 --> 05:55:27.120 align:start position:0%
from the boston globe
 
05:55:31.270 --> 05:55:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:33.750 --> 05:55:33.760 align:start position:0%
the tv station in burlington vermont
 
05:55:35.670 --> 05:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
covered the seven crashes
 
05:55:37.510 --> 05:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
that we had this weekend
 
05:55:41.190 --> 05:55:41.200 align:start position:0%
and in virtually every crash they
 
05:55:41.200 --> 05:55:44.628 align:start position:0%
and in virtually every crash they
quote

05:55:44.628 --> 05:55:44.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:44.638 --> 05:55:45.910 align:start position:0%
 
mostly

05:55:45.910 --> 05:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
mostly
 
05:55:50.628 --> 05:55:50.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:53.110 --> 05:55:53.120 align:start position:0%
as to the nature of the crashes and in
 
05:55:55.030 --> 05:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
virtually every case
 
05:55:58.070 --> 05:55:58.080 align:start position:0%
the crash is uh
 
05:56:00.070 --> 05:56:00.080 align:start position:0%
indicated to be inexperience and
 
05:56:00.080 --> 05:56:01.510 align:start position:0%
indicated to be inexperience and
inattention

05:56:01.510 --> 05:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
inattention
 
05:56:03.990 --> 05:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
of the primary consider contributing
 
05:56:06.548 --> 05:56:06.558 align:start position:0%
factors in many cases it's rental
 
05:56:06.558 --> 05:56:07.670 align:start position:0%
factors in many cases it's rental
machines

05:56:07.670 --> 05:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
machines
 
05:56:09.830 --> 05:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
these rental companies rent the machines
 
05:56:14.070 --> 05:56:14.080 align:start position:0%
out they i understand they show a video
 
05:56:15.990 --> 05:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
and give some instruction but it's
 
05:56:18.788 --> 05:56:18.798 align:start position:0%
certainly not enough we require safety
 
05:56:21.190 --> 05:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
training for boating we require it for
 
05:56:21.200 --> 05:56:22.708 align:start position:0%
training for boating we require it for
motorcycles

05:56:22.708 --> 05:56:22.718 align:start position:0%
motorcycles
 
05:56:22.718 --> 05:56:23.590 align:start position:0%
motorcycles
and

05:56:23.590 --> 05:56:23.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:56:25.430 --> 05:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
why we haven't gotten around to
 
05:56:28.150 --> 05:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
snowmobiles and ohrvs
 
05:56:30.948 --> 05:56:30.958 align:start position:0%
is really beyond me at this point but my
 
05:56:33.670 --> 05:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
concern is that up in the north country
 
05:56:34.948 --> 05:56:34.958 align:start position:0%
right now
 
05:56:37.910 --> 05:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
our tourism business is next to nil
 
05:56:41.430 --> 05:56:41.440 align:start position:0%
we've we lost the year to the pandemic
 
05:56:42.708 --> 05:56:42.718 align:start position:0%
at least
 
05:56:45.110 --> 05:56:45.120 align:start position:0%
i think we're still losing some of that
 
05:56:47.110 --> 05:56:47.120 align:start position:0%
and our tourism
 
05:56:49.750 --> 05:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
is down dramatically
 
05:56:51.830 --> 05:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
i don't think it helps any
 
05:56:53.670 --> 05:56:53.680 align:start position:0%
that we have these injuries every
 
05:56:56.150 --> 05:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
weekend and some of them require
 
05:57:00.470 --> 05:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
helicopters our hote our hospital in
 
05:57:02.628 --> 05:57:02.638 align:start position:0%
colebrook is very small
 
05:57:04.548 --> 05:57:04.558 align:start position:0%
and they can take some of these people
 
05:57:05.910 --> 05:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
in but they also have some covert
 
05:57:07.430 --> 05:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
patients in
 
05:57:09.110 --> 05:57:09.120 align:start position:0%
and in and out
 
05:57:09.120 --> 05:57:09.990 align:start position:0%
and in and out
and

05:57:09.990 --> 05:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:57:12.628 --> 05:57:12.638 align:start position:0%
in many cases they're not equipped
 
05:57:15.110 --> 05:57:15.120 align:start position:0%
to handle the injuries that are
 
05:57:17.270 --> 05:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
sustained so they call in the medflight
 
05:57:19.910 --> 05:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
out of dartmouth
 
05:57:23.430 --> 05:57:23.440 align:start position:0%
the cost of that runs around 22 000 and
 
05:57:23.440 --> 05:57:24.150 align:start position:0%
the cost of that runs around 22 000 and
up

05:57:24.150 --> 05:57:24.160 align:start position:0%
up
 
05:57:25.590 --> 05:57:25.600 align:start position:0%
depending on whether they need a flight
 
05:57:26.868 --> 05:57:26.878 align:start position:0%
surgeon or not if they know where
 
05:57:28.868 --> 05:57:28.878 align:start position:0%
they're going
 
05:57:32.230 --> 05:57:32.240 align:start position:0%
it also um
 
05:57:34.310 --> 05:57:34.320 align:start position:0%
really i think can be attributed to just
 
05:57:36.628 --> 05:57:36.638 align:start position:0%
lack of training and almost every one of
 
05:57:38.628 --> 05:57:38.638 align:start position:0%
these accidents there's some reason the
 
05:57:41.590 --> 05:57:41.600 align:start position:0%
people did what they did to end up in a
 
05:57:44.070 --> 05:57:44.080 align:start position:0%
crash and generally it's inexperienced
 
05:57:45.990 --> 05:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
or they're going too fast
 
05:57:47.350 --> 05:57:47.360 align:start position:0%
and we have
 
05:57:48.868 --> 05:57:48.878 align:start position:0%
another bill in the legislature
 
05:57:48.878 --> 05:57:49.830 align:start position:0%
another bill in the legislature
currently

05:57:49.830 --> 05:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
currently
 
05:57:51.910 --> 05:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
to regulate the
 
05:57:54.548 --> 05:57:54.558 align:start position:0%
put a governor on the rental machines
 
05:57:56.150 --> 05:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
some of our
 
05:57:57.750 --> 05:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
people that rent them in the north
 
05:57:59.750 --> 05:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
country have already done that of their
 
05:58:01.510 --> 05:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
own volition and some
 
05:58:05.030 --> 05:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
need to be pushed a little bit i guess
 
05:58:06.628 --> 05:58:06.638 align:start position:0%
that's really all i have to say i do
 
05:58:09.190 --> 05:58:09.200 align:start position:0%
support the bill and
 
05:58:11.110 --> 05:58:11.120 align:start position:0%
i think that again
 
05:58:12.948 --> 05:58:12.958 align:start position:0%
captain eastman can probably give you
 
05:58:15.190 --> 05:58:15.200 align:start position:0%
more specifics on the
 
05:58:17.590 --> 05:58:17.600 align:start position:0%
crashes and the reasons for them thank
 
05:58:19.590 --> 05:58:19.600 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you representative
 
05:58:23.510 --> 05:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:25.670 --> 05:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
i have one question representative you
 
05:58:27.990 --> 05:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
heard the prime sponsor say that he was
 
05:58:30.070 --> 05:58:30.080 align:start position:0%
an executive session going to recommend
 
05:58:32.150 --> 05:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
interim study do you also recommend
 
05:58:33.670 --> 05:58:33.680 align:start position:0%
intimate study
 
05:58:35.750 --> 05:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh i'm going to
 
05:58:38.390 --> 05:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
follow chris's lead i
 
05:58:41.110 --> 05:58:41.120 align:start position:0%
he wrote the bill i co-sponsored it
 
05:58:43.830 --> 05:58:43.840 align:start position:0%
because i really believe we need some
 
05:58:47.030 --> 05:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
sort of training on all these machines
 
05:58:47.040 --> 05:58:48.230 align:start position:0%
sort of training on all these machines
um

05:58:48.230 --> 05:58:48.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:58:50.628 --> 05:58:50.638 align:start position:0%
and i'll i'll
 
05:58:52.868 --> 05:58:52.878 align:start position:0%
defer to him on what he believes it
 
05:58:55.590 --> 05:58:55.600 align:start position:0%
should happen thank you any more
 
05:58:57.270 --> 05:58:57.280 align:start position:0%
questions for the representative no
 
05:58:58.310 --> 05:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
05:59:06.628 --> 05:59:06.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:08.868 --> 05:59:08.878 align:start position:0%
next i call back again captain michael
 
05:59:08.878 --> 05:59:10.230 align:start position:0%
next i call back again captain michael
eastman

05:59:10.230 --> 05:59:10.240 align:start position:0%
eastman
 
05:59:12.310 --> 05:59:12.320 align:start position:0%
new hampshire fish and game
 
05:59:14.948 --> 05:59:14.958 align:start position:0%
in favor with an amendment
 
05:59:17.350 --> 05:59:17.360 align:start position:0%
captain eastman welcome back
 
05:59:20.230 --> 05:59:20.240 align:start position:0%
thank you members committee
 
05:59:23.350 --> 05:59:23.360 align:start position:0%
we are in in favor of this uh or support
 
05:59:26.310 --> 05:59:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:28.788 --> 05:59:28.798 align:start position:0%
bill upon with the amendment uh with the
 
05:59:31.350 --> 05:59:31.360 align:start position:0%
interim study um
 
05:59:34.390 --> 05:59:34.400 align:start position:0%
my commission and director feel that uh
 
05:59:37.510 --> 05:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
what was presently submitted
 
05:59:40.310 --> 05:59:40.320 align:start position:0%
which was app modeled after the boating
 
05:59:40.320 --> 05:59:41.590 align:start position:0%
which was app modeled after the boating
education

05:59:41.590 --> 05:59:41.600 align:start position:0%
education
 
05:59:43.670 --> 05:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
um with a graduated
 
05:59:45.670 --> 05:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
age on when
 
05:59:48.548 --> 05:59:48.558 align:start position:0%
individuals need to have
 
05:59:51.030 --> 05:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
you know their certification by um and
 
05:59:52.390 --> 05:59:52.400 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
05:59:54.708 --> 05:59:54.718 align:start position:0%
really the the cutoff age or
 
05:59:57.110 --> 05:59:57.120 align:start position:0%
grandfathering age was modeled after um
 
05:59:59.990 --> 06:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
what the vermont vast system uh does
 
06:00:02.230 --> 06:00:02.240 align:start position:0%
currently so um
 
06:00:04.070 --> 06:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
by commission and detective director
 
06:00:05.990 --> 06:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
believe that this would would they'd
 
06:00:07.430 --> 06:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
like to have a little more time to look
 
06:00:08.868 --> 06:00:08.878 align:start position:0%
at this see if this is actually the
 
06:00:10.548 --> 06:00:10.558 align:start position:0%
model that would be
 
06:00:12.548 --> 06:00:12.558 align:start position:0%
best for us um you know there are
 
06:00:15.190 --> 06:00:15.200 align:start position:0%
certain components um with the program
 
06:00:16.470 --> 06:00:16.480 align:start position:0%
as far as
 
06:00:19.510 --> 06:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
we have an online platform and also a a
 
06:00:19.520 --> 06:00:20.310 align:start position:0%
we have an online platform and also a a
uh

06:00:20.310 --> 06:00:20.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:00:23.270 --> 06:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
in person um safety course that's that's
 
06:00:25.510 --> 06:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
really done through volunteers and we
 
06:00:27.750 --> 06:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
need to look at all of those um aspects
 
06:00:29.190 --> 06:00:29.200 align:start position:0%
to make sure that it would all work
 
06:00:29.200 --> 06:00:30.230 align:start position:0%
to make sure that it would all work
before

06:00:30.230 --> 06:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
before
 
06:00:32.230 --> 06:00:32.240 align:start position:0%
we would be thoroughly in favor of
 
06:00:34.070 --> 06:00:34.080 align:start position:0%
something going forward so we think a
 
06:00:36.548 --> 06:00:36.558 align:start position:0%
study would be appropriate
 
06:00:38.390 --> 06:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
thank you captain any questions for the
 
06:00:38.400 --> 06:00:42.150 align:start position:0%
thank you captain any questions for the
captain

06:00:42.150 --> 06:00:42.160 align:start position:0%

representative cohen then representative
 
06:00:44.320 --> 06:00:46.708 align:start position:0%
representative cohen then representative
post

06:00:46.708 --> 06:00:46.718 align:start position:0%
post
 
06:00:48.470 --> 06:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
captain easton just want to ask that
 
06:00:48.480 --> 06:00:49.510 align:start position:0%
captain easton just want to ask that
question

06:00:49.510 --> 06:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:00:51.350 --> 06:00:51.360 align:start position:0%
for clarification on the way the bill
 
06:00:53.830 --> 06:00:53.840 align:start position:0%
stands now
 
06:00:57.270 --> 06:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
if a 12 year old gets a
 
06:00:57.280 --> 06:00:58.310 align:start position:0%
if a 12 year old gets a
training

06:00:58.310 --> 06:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
training
 
06:01:01.110 --> 06:01:01.120 align:start position:0%
is he or she now certified for life they
 
06:01:02.948 --> 06:01:02.958 align:start position:0%
know there's no refresher as they get
 
06:01:07.590 --> 06:01:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:09.590 --> 06:01:09.600 align:start position:0%
that is correct the current law
 
06:01:11.670 --> 06:01:11.680 align:start position:0%
which that was as part of the current
 
06:01:14.230 --> 06:01:14.240 align:start position:0%
law which is that uh person 12 years of
 
06:01:14.240 --> 06:01:15.670 align:start position:0%
law which is that uh person 12 years of
age

06:01:15.670 --> 06:01:15.680 align:start position:0%
age
 
06:01:18.070 --> 06:01:18.080 align:start position:0%
can take an ohrv safety course which
 
06:01:20.628 --> 06:01:20.638 align:start position:0%
would then allow them to
 
06:01:20.638 --> 06:01:22.150 align:start position:0%
would then allow them to
operate

06:01:22.150 --> 06:01:22.160 align:start position:0%
operate
 
06:01:24.150 --> 06:01:24.160 align:start position:0%
not by themselves but they would have to
 
06:01:26.470 --> 06:01:26.480 align:start position:0%
be accompanied
 
06:01:28.070 --> 06:01:28.080 align:start position:0%
in essence if you're 12 years old you
 
06:01:29.590 --> 06:01:29.600 align:start position:0%
took this course and let's say you were
 
06:01:31.510 --> 06:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
operating a snow machine you could
 
06:01:34.628 --> 06:01:34.638 align:start position:0%
operate um
 
06:01:36.230 --> 06:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
let's say to a road crossing so you
 
06:01:38.150 --> 06:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
could actually operate on a trail with a
 
06:01:39.990 --> 06:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
being accompanied if you got to a road
 
06:01:42.310 --> 06:01:42.320 align:start position:0%
crossing you could actually operate that
 
06:01:44.310 --> 06:01:44.320 align:start position:0%
machine across the road to the other
 
06:01:45.830 --> 06:01:45.840 align:start position:0%
side of the to the trail and then
 
06:01:47.190 --> 06:01:47.200 align:start position:0%
continue on
 
06:01:49.350 --> 06:01:49.360 align:start position:0%
without the card
 
06:01:50.868 --> 06:01:50.878 align:start position:0%
you would
 
06:01:52.230 --> 06:01:52.240 align:start position:0%
with a person accompanying you would
 
06:01:54.628 --> 06:01:54.638 align:start position:0%
have to stop at that road crossing you'd
 
06:01:56.310 --> 06:01:56.320 align:start position:0%
have that 12 year old have to get off
 
06:01:57.430 --> 06:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
they would have to
 
06:01:59.190 --> 06:01:59.200 align:start position:0%
then take the machine across the road
 
06:02:00.868 --> 06:02:00.878 align:start position:0%
and then the 12 euro would get back on
 
06:02:00.878 --> 06:02:01.830 align:start position:0%
and then the 12 euro would get back on
it

06:02:01.830 --> 06:02:01.840 align:start position:0%
it
 
06:02:04.948 --> 06:02:04.958 align:start position:0%
so once they get it at 12 to 4 to
 
06:02:07.110 --> 06:02:07.120 align:start position:0%
basically the day before their 14th
 
06:02:09.350 --> 06:02:09.360 align:start position:0%
birthday they can operate with someone
 
06:02:12.470 --> 06:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
being accompanied once they become 14
 
06:02:14.868 --> 06:02:14.878 align:start position:0%
and older with that card they can
 
06:02:17.750 --> 06:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
operate unaccompanied um until they get
 
06:02:21.030 --> 06:02:21.040 align:start position:0%
their driver's license at 16 and then
 
06:02:22.948 --> 06:02:22.958 align:start position:0%
there's no real requirement for a
 
06:02:25.110 --> 06:02:25.120 align:start position:0%
foreign hrv safety program
 
06:02:27.110 --> 06:02:27.120 align:start position:0%
clarification question follow-up
 
06:02:28.310 --> 06:02:28.320 align:start position:0%
question please
 
06:02:30.470 --> 06:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
so for based on what you just said
 
06:02:33.510 --> 06:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
if a 12 to 14 year old or when that 12
 
06:02:35.430 --> 06:02:35.440 align:start position:0%
year old gets to 14 and doesn't need to
 
06:02:36.788 --> 06:02:36.798 align:start position:0%
be accompanied
 
06:02:39.110 --> 06:02:39.120 align:start position:0%
does that mean he or she can drive a
 
06:02:41.350 --> 06:02:41.360 align:start position:0%
snowmobile on any class
 
06:02:46.628 --> 06:02:46.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:46.638 --> 06:02:51.110 align:start position:0%
 
unaccompanied

06:02:51.110 --> 06:02:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:52.788 --> 06:02:52.798 align:start position:0%
two sides of that question there aren't
 
06:02:54.548 --> 06:02:54.558 align:start position:0%
snowmobiles really operating on one
 
06:02:54.558 --> 06:02:55.510 align:start position:0%
snowmobiles really operating on one
through

06:02:55.510 --> 06:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
through
 
06:02:57.030 --> 06:02:57.040 align:start position:0%
through three
 
06:02:57.040 --> 06:02:58.390 align:start position:0%
through three
roadways

06:02:58.390 --> 06:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
roadways
 
06:02:58.400 --> 06:02:59.670 align:start position:0%
roadways
um

06:02:59.670 --> 06:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:03:02.310 --> 06:03:02.320 align:start position:0%
there certainly are could be trails
 
06:03:05.670 --> 06:03:05.680 align:start position:0%
beside the one through three highways
 
06:03:08.070 --> 06:03:08.080 align:start position:0%
but that would be considered a trail
 
06:03:11.030 --> 06:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
so they couldn't actually operate on
 
06:03:13.430 --> 06:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
that classification of you know a state
 
06:03:13.440 --> 06:03:14.628 align:start position:0%
that classification of you know a state
road

06:03:14.628 --> 06:03:14.638 align:start position:0%
road
 
06:03:16.628 --> 06:03:16.638 align:start position:0%
per se there are some
 
06:03:18.230 --> 06:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
snowmobile trails that will come out
 
06:03:20.788 --> 06:03:20.798 align:start position:0%
onto a road and travel maybe alongside
 
06:03:22.948 --> 06:03:22.958 align:start position:0%
the edge of the road um i can think of
 
06:03:24.868 --> 06:03:24.878 align:start position:0%
like hail road in samaritan there used
 
06:03:26.548 --> 06:03:26.558 align:start position:0%
to be a large portion of that that went
 
06:03:27.990 --> 06:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
up underneath the highway and then went
 
06:03:30.788 --> 06:03:30.798 align:start position:0%
back into the woods
 
06:03:32.390 --> 06:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
they could act because because that is
 
06:03:35.510 --> 06:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
part of the trail now on the ohrv side
 
06:03:36.548 --> 06:03:36.558 align:start position:0%
of it
 
06:03:39.510 --> 06:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
they cannot operate on a on a roadway
 
06:03:42.628 --> 06:03:42.638 align:start position:0%
um without being accompanied by somebody
 
06:03:44.548 --> 06:03:44.558 align:start position:0%
until they're eight
 
06:03:47.030 --> 06:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
18 and it's until they
 
06:03:50.310 --> 06:03:50.320 align:start position:0%
so they couldn't operate um and without
 
06:03:52.230 --> 06:03:52.240 align:start position:0%
someone that uh was 20 unless they had
 
06:03:53.910 --> 06:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
someone who was 25 years of age
 
06:03:55.670 --> 06:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
accompanying them basically on those
 
06:03:55.680 --> 06:03:56.948 align:start position:0%
accompanying them basically on those
roadways

06:03:56.948 --> 06:03:56.958 align:start position:0%
roadways
 
06:03:59.590 --> 06:03:59.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for the clarification
 
06:04:02.070 --> 06:04:02.080 align:start position:0%
representative post
 
06:04:05.270 --> 06:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:08.390 --> 06:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
when we heard about the orvs
 
06:04:08.400 --> 06:04:09.430 align:start position:0%
when we heard about the orvs
um

06:04:09.430 --> 06:04:09.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:04:11.510 --> 06:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
a few weeks ago
 
06:04:14.830 --> 06:04:14.840 align:start position:0%
and it may have even been in the
 
06:04:18.788 --> 06:04:18.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:21.030 --> 06:04:21.040 align:start position:0%
we were told that you couldn't put
 
06:04:21.040 --> 06:04:22.788 align:start position:0%
we were told that you couldn't put
governors

06:04:22.788 --> 06:04:22.798 align:start position:0%
governors
 
06:04:22.798 --> 06:04:23.910 align:start position:0%
governors
on

06:04:23.910 --> 06:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
on
 
06:04:27.990 --> 06:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:30.150 --> 06:04:30.160 align:start position:0%
is that true i mean and that was kind of
 
06:04:31.910 --> 06:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
like my recollection that you couldn't
 
06:04:34.948 --> 06:04:34.958 align:start position:0%
put governors on them
 
06:04:34.958 --> 06:04:35.670 align:start position:0%
put governors on them
that

06:04:35.670 --> 06:04:35.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:04:38.070 --> 06:04:38.080 align:start position:0%
no i'm not sure um where that came from
 
06:04:40.310 --> 06:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
they definitely have been governing
 
06:04:42.150 --> 06:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
uh there's been some companies have been
 
06:04:44.150 --> 06:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
governing snow machines and depends upon
 
06:04:44.160 --> 06:04:46.070 align:start position:0%
governing snow machines and depends upon
manufacture

06:04:46.070 --> 06:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
manufacture
 
06:04:47.750 --> 06:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
i know skadoo hasn't been able to
 
06:04:49.670 --> 06:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
because they have a special key that you
 
06:04:51.350 --> 06:04:51.360 align:start position:0%
can put in that will actually govern
 
06:04:54.868 --> 06:04:54.878 align:start position:0%
snowmobiles um i know polaris is i don't
 
06:04:57.270 --> 06:04:57.280 align:start position:0%
they can do it on the on the side by
 
06:05:00.150 --> 06:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
side oh hrv side of it i
 
06:05:01.190 --> 06:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
believe they're getting there with a
 
06:05:05.270 --> 06:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
snowmobile um side of it but certainly
 
06:05:07.350 --> 06:05:07.360 align:start position:0%
i know the polar the polaris side by
 
06:05:08.948 --> 06:05:08.958 align:start position:0%
sides that are being operated this
 
06:05:11.110 --> 06:05:11.120 align:start position:0%
summer like out of gorham those were
 
06:05:12.868 --> 06:05:12.878 align:start position:0%
those were governed
 
06:05:14.628 --> 06:05:14.638 align:start position:0%
to 40 miles an hour
 
06:05:17.590 --> 06:05:17.600 align:start position:0%
okay um can i follow up to that so so i
 
06:05:19.910 --> 06:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
wasn't really talking about snowmobiles
 
06:05:22.070 --> 06:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
i was talking about the the off-road
 
06:05:24.390 --> 06:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
vehicles we had talked about
 
06:05:24.400 --> 06:05:25.670 align:start position:0%
vehicles we had talked about
previously

06:05:25.670 --> 06:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
previously
 
06:05:27.830 --> 06:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
because this also says
 
06:05:31.590 --> 06:05:31.600 align:start position:0%
ohrvs and snowmobiles so are they able
 
06:05:35.830 --> 06:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
to put governors on the oh rvs
 
06:05:38.230 --> 06:05:38.240 align:start position:0%
polaris has now come up with a system
 
06:05:40.150 --> 06:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
where they can govern those um i'm not
 
06:05:41.510 --> 06:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
sure about some of the other
 
06:05:43.990 --> 06:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
manufacturers i believe they're there um
 
06:05:46.310 --> 06:05:46.320 align:start position:0%
but the majority of the rentals that
 
06:05:48.390 --> 06:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
we're seeing now are
 
06:05:50.948 --> 06:05:50.958 align:start position:0%
polaris rentals and they are governed
 
06:05:52.070 --> 06:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
and the ones
 
06:05:54.628 --> 06:05:54.638 align:start position:0%
specifically out of gorham um then there
 
06:05:55.910 --> 06:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
are a handful
 
06:05:57.750 --> 06:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
but the one major
 
06:06:00.708 --> 06:06:00.718 align:start position:0%
uh renter uh rental agent
 
06:06:02.788 --> 06:06:02.798 align:start position:0%
his machines were governed
 
06:06:04.948 --> 06:06:04.958 align:start position:0%
to 40 miles an hour
 
06:06:08.070 --> 06:06:08.080 align:start position:0%

06:07:53.830 --> 06:07:53.840 align:start position:0%
issue
 
06:07:56.230 --> 06:07:56.240 align:start position:0%
year after year for both summer and
 
06:07:58.150 --> 06:07:58.160 align:start position:0%
winter recreational
 
06:07:59.510 --> 06:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
um and
 
06:08:02.150 --> 06:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
uh somehow it morphed into well it
 
06:08:04.230 --> 06:08:04.240 align:start position:0%
should be just like boating
 
06:08:06.628 --> 06:08:06.638 align:start position:0%
but really the ohrv climate in new
 
06:08:09.350 --> 06:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire is not just like our boating
 
06:08:12.310 --> 06:08:12.320 align:start position:0%
uh this happens on public lands and
 
06:08:15.190 --> 06:08:15.200 align:start position:0%
private lands by
 
06:08:17.350 --> 06:08:17.360 align:start position:0%
many different entities
 
06:08:20.470 --> 06:08:20.480 align:start position:0%
in fact an ohrb in new hampshire is a
 
06:08:22.390 --> 06:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
railway motor car
 
06:08:22.400 --> 06:08:23.510 align:start position:0%
railway motor car
and

06:08:23.510 --> 06:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:08:26.948 --> 06:08:26.958 align:start position:0%
the cop valley rail trail club
 
06:08:30.070 --> 06:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
they in order to operate their ohrvs on
 
06:08:33.030 --> 06:08:33.040 align:start position:0%
the rails they have to have a safety
 
06:08:35.750 --> 06:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
course and a license
 
06:08:39.270 --> 06:08:39.280 align:start position:0%
it is not the ohrv safety course that we
 
06:08:42.628 --> 06:08:42.638 align:start position:0%
take for atvs and snowmobiles
 
06:08:42.638 --> 06:08:43.910 align:start position:0%
take for atvs and snowmobiles
so

06:08:43.910 --> 06:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:08:46.868 --> 06:08:46.878 align:start position:0%
this bill as written does need a little
 
06:08:48.548 --> 06:08:48.558 align:start position:0%
bit of
 
06:08:51.430 --> 06:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
work before it goes on
 
06:08:53.750 --> 06:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
the the other part of that is i took the
 
06:08:57.830 --> 06:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
ohrv safety course in 1976
 
06:08:59.590 --> 06:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
when i was 10 years old
 
06:08:59.600 --> 06:09:00.470 align:start position:0%
when i was 10 years old
and

06:09:00.470 --> 06:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:09:03.350 --> 06:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
so far the records of that are no longer
 
06:09:04.788 --> 06:09:04.798 align:start position:0%
in existence
 
06:09:04.798 --> 06:09:05.590 align:start position:0%
in existence
so

06:09:05.590 --> 06:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:09:07.830 --> 06:09:07.840 align:start position:0%
requiring it for everybody there's
 
06:09:09.750 --> 06:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
people who have taken it and why would
 
06:09:11.430 --> 06:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
you make them take it again
 
06:09:13.590 --> 06:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
so again that should be studied a little
 
06:09:15.910 --> 06:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
bit maybe there needs to be a year cut
 
06:09:15.920 --> 06:09:16.708 align:start position:0%
bit maybe there needs to be a year cut
off

which is 1983
 
06:09:23.750 --> 06:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
and that puts those people about 38 and
 
06:09:26.548 --> 06:09:26.558 align:start position:0%

06:10:04.230 --> 06:10:04.240 align:start position:0%
federations
 
06:10:06.150 --> 06:10:06.160 align:start position:0%
is new hampshire's leading advocate for
 
06:10:07.830 --> 06:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
the promotion and protection of hunting
 
06:10:09.270 --> 06:10:09.280 align:start position:0%
fishing and trapping rights in new
 
06:10:11.910 --> 06:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire as well as the protection of
 
06:10:13.430 --> 06:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
an access to hunting fishing and
 
06:10:13.440 --> 06:10:14.788 align:start position:0%
an access to hunting fishing and
trapping

06:10:14.788 --> 06:10:14.798 align:start position:0%
trapping
 
06:10:16.708 --> 06:10:16.718 align:start position:0%
properties and opportunities
 
06:10:18.628 --> 06:10:18.638 align:start position:0%
we support this bill we're thankful to
 
06:10:22.230 --> 06:10:22.240 align:start position:0%
see it come come in this year
 
06:10:23.750 --> 06:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
as you all know if anyone spends any
 
06:10:26.070 --> 06:10:26.080 align:start position:0%
time outside new hampshire you rely on
 
06:10:28.708 --> 06:10:28.718 align:start position:0%
both public and private land in order to
 
06:10:31.110 --> 06:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
both whether it's hunting fishing ohrv
 
06:10:33.270 --> 06:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
riding hiking just about everything
 
06:10:34.548 --> 06:10:34.558 align:start position:0%
there is
 
06:10:35.910 --> 06:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
and we see this as an opportunity to
 
06:10:37.270 --> 06:10:37.280 align:start position:0%
continue to
 
06:10:40.390 --> 06:10:40.400 align:start position:0%
protect and support private landowners
 
06:10:41.910 --> 06:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
the last thing we would ever want to see
 
06:10:44.150 --> 06:10:44.160 align:start position:0%
is a piece of property get posted for
 
06:10:47.990 --> 06:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
nobody to be able to use it because of
 
06:10:49.350 --> 06:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
there wasn't there was an issue on the
 
06:10:50.628 --> 06:10:50.638 align:start position:0%
property whether it's from hunting
 
06:10:52.948 --> 06:10:52.958 align:start position:0%
fishing trapping ohrv writing or
 
06:10:54.628 --> 06:10:54.638 align:start position:0%
anything along those lines so you see
 
06:10:56.070 --> 06:10:56.080 align:start position:0%
this as an opportunity to continue to
 
06:10:57.830 --> 06:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
improve education about all folks that
 
06:11:00.230 --> 06:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
are recreating outdoors and just add
 
06:11:02.310 --> 06:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
another layer of protection to protect
 
06:11:03.830 --> 06:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
and support the access to the private
 
06:11:06.708 --> 06:11:06.718 align:start position:0%
lands that we all kind of rely on so
 
06:11:08.310 --> 06:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
that's all i want to say but happy to
 
06:11:09.590 --> 06:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
answer any questions

thank you representative cohen thank you
 
06:33:14.390 --> 06:33:14.400 align:start position:0%

the sponsors are were able to be here to
 
06:33:19.990 --> 06:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
introduce the bill so i am just putting
 
06:33:22.788 --> 06:33:22.798 align:start position:0%
the bill into our front of us to start
 
06:33:25.350 --> 06:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
our discussions in our public hearing
 
06:33:27.350 --> 06:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
so i'll take any questions but it's not
 
06:33:29.350 --> 06:33:29.360 align:start position:0%
my bill so
 
06:33:31.510 --> 06:33:31.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative i'm assuming no

06:33:33.600 --> 06:33:35.190 align:start position:0%
one has a question for representative
cohen

06:33:35.190 --> 06:33:35.200 align:start position:0%
cohen
 
06:33:42.310 --> 06:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:45.030 --> 06:33:45.040 align:start position:0%
next uh witness ted dears of new
 
06:33:49.750 --> 06:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire des in opposition to the bill
 
06:33:56.708 --> 06:33:56.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:58.628 --> 06:33:58.638 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair members of
 
06:33:59.990 --> 06:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
the committee it's a pleasure to be here
 
06:34:01.750 --> 06:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
with you today i will go relatively
 
06:34:03.430 --> 06:34:03.440 align:start position:0%
quickly through my testimony because i
 
06:34:03.440 --> 06:34:04.150 align:start position:0%
quickly through my testimony because i
know

06:34:04.150 --> 06:34:04.160 align:start position:0%
know
 
06:34:05.510 --> 06:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
you've had a long day and this is your
 
06:34:07.910 --> 06:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
last hearing so i stand between you and
 
06:34:09.830 --> 06:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
uh skedaddling so
 
06:34:12.150 --> 06:34:12.160 align:start position:0%
i uh we'll just uh because we didn't
 
06:34:13.750 --> 06:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
have a sponsor what i thought i would
 
06:34:15.430 --> 06:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
just do is just talk really briefly
 
06:34:16.548 --> 06:34:16.558 align:start position:0%
about what this bill would do it has
 
06:34:18.868 --> 06:34:18.878 align:start position:0%
several parts and so just really from a
 
06:34:22.310 --> 06:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
really high level here's the deal so um
 
06:34:24.628 --> 06:34:24.638 align:start position:0%
it has really three sections one section
 
06:34:26.150 --> 06:34:26.160 align:start position:0%
would put the current
 
06:34:29.350 --> 06:34:29.360 align:start position:0%
mcls that we have for pfas compounds
 
06:34:32.070 --> 06:34:32.080 align:start position:0%
into into statute for
 
06:34:34.948 --> 06:34:34.958 align:start position:0%
surface waters uh i testified about this
 
06:34:37.430 --> 06:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
last week if you recall that seemed like
 
06:34:40.150 --> 06:34:40.160 align:start position:0%
ages ago uh many many bills ago i'm sure
 
06:34:42.468 --> 06:34:42.478 align:start position:0%
for you all but um and basically
 
06:34:43.990 --> 06:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
expressed our opposition we are
 
06:34:46.468 --> 06:34:46.478 align:start position:0%
currently writing those rules right now
 
06:34:49.110 --> 06:34:49.120 align:start position:0%
in fact today i was reviewing our draft
 
06:34:51.030 --> 06:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
we will have an initial proposal out on
 
06:34:54.230 --> 06:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
the street to get those mcls into our
 
06:34:56.150 --> 06:34:56.160 align:start position:0%
surface water quality standards within a
 
06:34:57.910 --> 06:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
few months that initial proposal will be
 
06:35:00.390 --> 06:35:00.400 align:start position:0%
out on the streets happy to share that
 
06:35:02.070 --> 06:35:02.080 align:start position:0%
as soon as it is drafted but i would
 
06:35:05.270 --> 06:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
tell you today i was reviewing the draft
 
06:35:07.750 --> 06:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
the second piece of this would have us
 
06:35:10.230 --> 06:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
take those mcls and take a next really
 
06:35:11.590 --> 06:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
major step
 
06:35:12.868 --> 06:35:12.878 align:start position:0%
and i want to explain this because it's
 
06:35:15.190 --> 06:35:15.200 align:start position:0%
kind of difficult to understand what
 
06:35:18.230 --> 06:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
this what this is really doing but what
 
06:35:20.868 --> 06:35:20.878 align:start position:0%
this would do is it would take those
 
06:35:23.830 --> 06:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
mcls or something like them using the
 
06:35:26.390 --> 06:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
same chemicals those same four chemicals
 
06:35:30.868 --> 06:35:30.878 align:start position:0%
and would tell us to apply them to
 
06:35:33.910 --> 06:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
in a way to all waters that might affect
 
06:35:37.590 --> 06:35:37.600 align:start position:0%
how people consume water and fish
 
06:35:38.948 --> 06:35:38.958 align:start position:0%
this is hard to explain but i'm going to
 
06:35:40.708 --> 06:35:40.718 align:start position:0%
try to do it this way
 
06:35:43.590 --> 06:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
so the mcls only apply to drinking water
 
06:35:46.150 --> 06:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
that is water you're actually drinking
 
06:35:48.548 --> 06:35:48.558 align:start position:0%
they don't apply to the other things in
 
06:35:51.750 --> 06:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
which you might consume pfas
 
06:35:54.390 --> 06:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
one of those ways would be to eat it
 
06:35:56.548 --> 06:35:56.558 align:start position:0%
that is by eating fish which would have
 
06:36:01.030 --> 06:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
been contaminated by pfas right so those
 
06:36:02.390 --> 06:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
fish would have been swimming around in
 
06:36:04.708 --> 06:36:04.718 align:start position:0%
water the water would have somehow been
 
06:36:07.670 --> 06:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
contaminated by pfas or the sediment um
 
06:36:09.590 --> 06:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
and then it would have bioaccumulate up
 
06:36:12.468 --> 06:36:12.478 align:start position:0%
through the food chain and be consumed
 
06:36:14.230 --> 06:36:14.240 align:start position:0%
so if you look at our water quality
 
06:36:16.788 --> 06:36:16.798 align:start position:0%
standards those standards are an env wq
 
06:36:16.798 --> 06:36:18.468 align:start position:0%
standards those standards are an env wq
1700

06:36:18.468 --> 06:36:18.478 align:start position:0%
1700
 
06:36:20.868 --> 06:36:20.878 align:start position:0%
when you look across our our our our
 
06:36:23.110 --> 06:36:23.120 align:start position:0%
table what i call our our table of
 
06:36:25.510 --> 06:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
methyl ethyl death it's this big long
 
06:36:27.510 --> 06:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
table it has all the chemicals that we
 
06:36:29.750 --> 06:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
regulate in our surface waters
 
06:36:31.830 --> 06:36:31.840 align:start position:0%
and when you look across that there's a
 
06:36:33.590 --> 06:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
number of different ways in which we
 
06:36:35.750 --> 06:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
look at water quality standards some of
 
06:36:37.350 --> 06:36:37.360 align:start position:0%
those are ways in which
 
06:36:39.670 --> 06:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
is the chemical bad for fish right
 
06:36:41.030 --> 06:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
because we also shouldn't be killing the
 
06:36:42.390 --> 06:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
fish themselves
 
06:36:44.310 --> 06:36:44.320 align:start position:0%
so that's one set of
 
06:36:44.320 --> 06:36:45.190 align:start position:0%
so that's one set of
of

06:36:45.190 --> 06:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:36:45.200 --> 06:36:46.628 align:start position:0%
of
criteria

06:36:46.628 --> 06:36:46.638 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
06:36:48.868 --> 06:36:48.878 align:start position:0%
another set of criteria deals with
 
06:36:52.070 --> 06:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
people who would be eating the fish
 
06:36:53.990 --> 06:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
and it's not the amount that's in the
 
06:36:56.150 --> 06:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
fish itself it's the amount that's in
 
06:36:59.030 --> 06:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
the water that would eventually end up
 
06:37:01.590 --> 06:37:01.600 align:start position:0%
in fish that would then be dangerous for
 
06:37:02.868 --> 06:37:02.878 align:start position:0%
people to eat
 
06:37:04.868 --> 06:37:04.878 align:start position:0%
so i want to make i hope this is kind of
 
06:37:06.788 --> 06:37:06.798 align:start position:0%
clear but that's that's what this is
 
06:37:07.910 --> 06:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
getting at
 
06:37:11.350 --> 06:37:11.360 align:start position:0%
this is telling us to set the amount of
 
06:37:11.360 --> 06:37:12.468 align:start position:0%
this is telling us to set the amount of
pfas

06:37:12.468 --> 06:37:12.478 align:start position:0%
pfas
 
06:37:14.708 --> 06:37:14.718 align:start position:0%
that can be in water
 
06:37:16.788 --> 06:37:16.798 align:start position:0%
that would make it dangerous to eat the
 
06:37:16.798 --> 06:37:18.548 align:start position:0%
that would make it dangerous to eat the
fish

06:37:18.548 --> 06:37:18.558 align:start position:0%
fish
 
06:37:20.628 --> 06:37:20.638 align:start position:0%
so that's what the second part of this
 
06:37:22.070 --> 06:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
bill would do and then the third part of
 
06:37:24.390 --> 06:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
this bill basically says
 
06:37:26.310 --> 06:37:26.320 align:start position:0%
report on this report back to to the
 
06:37:28.788 --> 06:37:28.798 align:start position:0%
legislature very frequently so that we
 
06:37:30.468 --> 06:37:30.478 align:start position:0%
know what you're doing and then you know
 
06:37:32.390 --> 06:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
go from there
 
06:37:34.708 --> 06:37:34.718 align:start position:0%
so as i mentioned
 
06:37:36.310 --> 06:37:36.320 align:start position:0%
we're opposed to this for a number of
 
06:37:38.788 --> 06:37:38.798 align:start position:0%
different reasons and i'm addressing the
 
06:37:40.548 --> 06:37:40.558 align:start position:0%
first one again really quickly is that
 
06:37:42.628 --> 06:37:42.638 align:start position:0%
we're moving forward with rules right
 
06:37:44.788 --> 06:37:44.798 align:start position:0%
now to put mcl's and that'll apply to
 
06:37:47.430 --> 06:37:47.440 align:start position:0%
sort of you know the drinking water side
 
06:37:50.548 --> 06:37:50.558 align:start position:0%
this issue of how you set a water
 
06:37:53.830 --> 06:37:53.840 align:start position:0%
quality sam standard for water
 
06:37:55.910 --> 06:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
based on fish consumption
 
06:37:58.708 --> 06:37:58.718 align:start position:0%
is not straightforward
 
06:38:00.948 --> 06:38:00.958 align:start position:0%
we do not currently have what the bill
 
06:38:03.548 --> 06:38:03.558 align:start position:0%
calls for is us to develop
 
06:38:06.468 --> 06:38:06.478 align:start position:0%
bioaccumulation factors that is
 
06:38:09.750 --> 06:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
what is the ratio that the fish can be
 
06:38:12.070 --> 06:38:12.080 align:start position:0%
in that would eventually
 
06:38:13.830 --> 06:38:13.840 align:start position:0%
of the water that they're in that
 
06:38:15.830 --> 06:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
eventually would be bad for fish for
 
06:38:17.510 --> 06:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
people to eat those fish
 
06:38:20.548 --> 06:38:20.558 align:start position:0%
those numbers do not exist
 
06:38:22.310 --> 06:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
we wrote a report which i sent to you
 
06:38:25.110 --> 06:38:25.120 align:start position:0%
all last week after the session on 1167
 
06:38:27.110 --> 06:38:27.120 align:start position:0%
which was our plan for surface water
 
06:38:28.948 --> 06:38:28.958 align:start position:0%
quality standards and in that it
 
06:38:31.830 --> 06:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
identified the costs of how we would go
 
06:38:33.830 --> 06:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
about trying to set
 
06:38:36.230 --> 06:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
those bio bio accumulation factors these
 
06:38:36.240 --> 06:38:38.390 align:start position:0%
those bio bio accumulation factors these
bafs

06:38:38.390 --> 06:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
bafs
 
06:38:38.400 --> 06:38:39.190 align:start position:0%
bafs
and

06:38:39.190 --> 06:38:39.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:38:42.070 --> 06:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
the numbers in order for us to set a new
 
06:38:44.548 --> 06:38:44.558 align:start position:0%
hampshire specific that is specific to
 
06:38:46.708 --> 06:38:46.718 align:start position:0%
the kinds of water we have
 
06:38:50.150 --> 06:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
the kinds of way that we eat fish here
 
06:38:50.160 --> 06:38:50.948 align:start position:0%
the kinds of way that we eat fish here
and

06:38:50.948 --> 06:38:50.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:38:53.830 --> 06:38:53.840 align:start position:0%
the kinds of fish that we would actually
 
06:38:55.110 --> 06:38:55.120 align:start position:0%
eat here
 
06:38:56.948 --> 06:38:56.958 align:start position:0%
if we were to set that standard from
 
06:38:59.510 --> 06:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
scratch by ourselves with the current
 
06:39:01.350 --> 06:39:01.360 align:start position:0%
amount of science that's out there it
 
06:39:02.788 --> 06:39:02.798 align:start position:0%
would be hundreds of thousands of
 
06:39:04.868 --> 06:39:04.878 align:start position:0%
dollars to develop that it would take us
 
06:39:06.948 --> 06:39:06.958 align:start position:0%
many years of laboratory research to do
 
06:39:06.958 --> 06:39:09.510 align:start position:0%
many years of laboratory research to do
so

06:39:09.510 --> 06:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:11.430 --> 06:39:11.440 align:start position:0%
epa is right now
 
06:39:13.350 --> 06:39:13.360 align:start position:0%
attacking this issue
 
06:39:15.590 --> 06:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
so in the past we as i mentioned we have
 
06:39:17.270 --> 06:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
this big long table of methyl ethyl
 
06:39:18.868 --> 06:39:18.878 align:start position:0%
death right has all these different
 
06:39:20.468 --> 06:39:20.478 align:start position:0%
chemicals in it
 
06:39:22.150 --> 06:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
all of those numbers that are in there
 
06:39:24.150 --> 06:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
came from epa guidance something called
 
06:39:26.150 --> 06:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
304a guidance
 
06:39:28.468 --> 06:39:28.478 align:start position:0%
so these are big documents that have
 
06:39:30.708 --> 06:39:30.718 align:start position:0%
been scientifically there it's basically
 
06:39:32.468 --> 06:39:32.478 align:start position:0%
accumulation of all the science about
 
06:39:34.468 --> 06:39:34.478 align:start position:0%
these various different chemicals we
 
06:39:36.628 --> 06:39:36.638 align:start position:0%
just had one come out on selenium for
 
06:39:38.948 --> 06:39:38.958 align:start position:0%
example and it's this long multi hundred
 
06:39:40.628 --> 06:39:40.638 align:start position:0%
page document that's filled with all the
 
06:39:42.708 --> 06:39:42.718 align:start position:0%
science about selenium and then it goes
 
06:39:44.948 --> 06:39:44.958 align:start position:0%
through a peer review process and then
 
06:39:46.948 --> 06:39:46.958 align:start position:0%
goes through a public comment process
 
06:39:49.030 --> 06:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
and then it actually gets approved and
 
06:39:51.110 --> 06:39:51.120 align:start position:0%
the states use that to set criteria
 
06:39:53.350 --> 06:39:53.360 align:start position:0%
that's the only way
 
06:39:55.190 --> 06:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
that we have ever set criteria for
 
06:39:57.190 --> 06:39:57.200 align:start position:0%
surface water quality in this state is
 
06:39:59.110 --> 06:39:59.120 align:start position:0%
by using those those those kinds of
 
06:40:01.430 --> 06:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
guidance documents epa is working on
 
06:40:05.110 --> 06:40:05.120 align:start position:0%
that right now on this issue of bafs
 
06:40:07.430 --> 06:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
we expect to see some drafts of that in
 
06:40:10.788 --> 06:40:10.798 align:start position:0%
2023 so not that long from now we expect
 
06:40:12.628 --> 06:40:12.638 align:start position:0%
to see that epa will have accumulated
 
06:40:14.868 --> 06:40:14.878 align:start position:0%
the science and begun this process of
 
06:40:17.990 --> 06:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
vetting public review and adopting these
 
06:40:20.468 --> 06:40:20.478 align:start position:0%
kinds of guidance criteria so we think
 
06:40:22.150 --> 06:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
that it's prudent
 
06:40:24.548 --> 06:40:24.558 align:start position:0%
to not spend the resources now
 
06:40:26.390 --> 06:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
um because those guys those guidance are
 
06:40:28.070 --> 06:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
going to come out anyway
 
06:40:29.990 --> 06:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
and understand what they say before we
 
06:40:32.548 --> 06:40:32.558 align:start position:0%
would be diving into how we would want
 
06:40:35.590 --> 06:40:35.600 align:start position:0%
to apply them within our own waters
 
06:40:37.190 --> 06:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
the only other thing that i'll just say
 
06:40:38.868 --> 06:40:38.878 align:start position:0%
is that you may be aware and this is
 
06:40:40.708 --> 06:40:40.718 align:start position:0%
obviously pfas is a big issue and we're
 
06:40:43.270 --> 06:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
very serious about it at des and we want
 
06:40:46.468 --> 06:40:46.478 align:start position:0%
to be driven absolutely by science
 
06:40:48.628 --> 06:40:48.638 align:start position:0%
we recently did a study of lakes in the
 
06:40:50.468 --> 06:40:50.478 align:start position:0%
southern part of the state in which we
 
06:40:51.910 --> 06:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
identified which we actually looked at
 
06:40:53.750 --> 06:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
the fish themselves
 
06:40:56.070 --> 06:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
are the fish themselves safe for people
 
06:40:57.110 --> 06:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
to eat
 
06:41:00.230 --> 06:41:00.240 align:start position:0%
fishing and we posted advisories on five
 
06:41:02.788 --> 06:41:02.798 align:start position:0%
lakes in the southern part of the state
 
06:41:05.510 --> 06:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
we can do that today we have the ability
 
06:41:07.350 --> 06:41:07.360 align:start position:0%
so if we find if somebody brings us a
 
06:41:07.360 --> 06:41:08.468 align:start position:0%
so if we find if somebody brings us a
fish

06:41:08.468 --> 06:41:08.478 align:start position:0%
fish
 
06:41:10.868 --> 06:41:10.878 align:start position:0%
and said and we test it and they give us
 
06:41:12.708 --> 06:41:12.718 align:start position:0%
the data we can run the numbers to see
 
06:41:14.468 --> 06:41:14.478 align:start position:0%
if it's safe to eat
 
06:41:15.990 --> 06:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
we think that that's a much better
 
06:41:18.628 --> 06:41:18.638 align:start position:0%
approach today to be able to deal with
 
06:41:21.190 --> 06:41:21.200 align:start position:0%
this issue of how pfast is ending up in
 
06:41:23.190 --> 06:41:23.200 align:start position:0%
fish than to try to develop a water
 
06:41:25.030 --> 06:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
quality standard for it because we
 
06:41:26.548 --> 06:41:26.558 align:start position:0%
currently have that and already we're
 
06:41:27.670 --> 06:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
doing it
 
06:41:29.670 --> 06:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
as we showed we already did five lakes
 
06:41:31.830 --> 06:41:31.840 align:start position:0%
the scary thing about this
 
06:41:33.270 --> 06:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
and this is the part that kind of freaks
 
06:41:35.270 --> 06:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
me out i'll be honest with you
 
06:41:37.270 --> 06:41:37.280 align:start position:0%
is that when we measured the water in
 
06:41:38.708 --> 06:41:38.718 align:start position:0%
those lakes
 
06:41:41.670 --> 06:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
that had fish that were not safe to eat
 
06:41:44.788 --> 06:41:44.798 align:start position:0%
the pfas levels were undetectable
 
06:41:47.270 --> 06:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
this i think highlights the very tricky
 
06:41:49.670 --> 06:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
issue related to this bill
 
06:41:52.390 --> 06:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
is how would we go about setting those
 
06:41:52.400 --> 06:41:53.350 align:start position:0%
is how would we go about setting those
numbers

06:41:53.350 --> 06:41:53.360 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
06:41:55.430 --> 06:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
when we're not even sure how this stuff
 
06:41:57.350 --> 06:41:57.360 align:start position:0%
is getting into the fish
 
06:41:59.510 --> 06:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
i'm going to close there see if you have
 
06:42:01.510 --> 06:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
any questions about this and leave it
 
06:42:04.628 --> 06:42:04.638 align:start position:0%
for other people to uh to talk about
 
06:42:06.788 --> 06:42:06.798 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your time thank
 
06:42:09.670 --> 06:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony any questions
 
06:42:11.510 --> 06:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
representative cohen
 
06:42:14.310 --> 06:42:14.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
06:42:17.110 --> 06:42:17.120 align:start position:0%
are there uh do you have access to other
 
06:42:19.350 --> 06:42:19.360 align:start position:0%
states that are trying to do the same
 
06:42:21.990 --> 06:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
thing with fish consumption numbers or
 
06:42:24.788 --> 06:42:24.798 align:start position:0%
is this a brand new science that nobody
 
06:42:27.190 --> 06:42:27.200 align:start position:0%
in the united states has attempted yet
 
06:42:28.868 --> 06:42:28.878 align:start position:0%
it's a great question representative
 
06:42:30.708 --> 06:42:30.718 align:start position:0%
cohen thank you very much i appreciate
 
06:42:32.708 --> 06:42:32.718 align:start position:0%
that the answer is absolutely lots of
 
06:42:33.590 --> 06:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
states are working on this
 
06:42:35.750 --> 06:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
simultaneously and that's why there's
 
06:42:37.270 --> 06:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
the states are putting so much pressure
 
06:42:38.628 --> 06:42:38.638 align:start position:0%
on epa
 
06:42:41.750 --> 06:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
to come up with sort of the the the gold
 
06:42:45.270 --> 06:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
standard of of data and research because
 
06:42:46.788 --> 06:42:46.798 align:start position:0%
otherwise we're going to end up with
 
06:42:49.910 --> 06:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
again a patchwork of regulation
 
06:42:51.590 --> 06:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
where we have waters that flow from one
 
06:42:53.590 --> 06:42:53.600 align:start position:0%
state into another state
 
06:42:56.548 --> 06:42:56.558 align:start position:0%
and we um have
 
06:42:58.310 --> 06:42:58.320 align:start position:0%
and we're all sort of out there babes in
 
06:43:00.468 --> 06:43:00.478 align:start position:0%
the woods on our own new jersey is
 
06:43:02.310 --> 06:43:02.320 align:start position:0%
certainly attacking this issue
 
06:43:04.070 --> 06:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
people point to texas texas set
 
06:43:05.150 --> 06:43:05.160 align:start position:0%
screening levels that are
 
06:43:08.390 --> 06:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily high like thousands of
 
06:43:10.150 --> 06:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
parts per trillion that we're not
 
06:43:12.230 --> 06:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
they're not even relevant to the numbers
 
06:43:14.310 --> 06:43:14.320 align:start position:0%
that that we see in the and the effects
 
06:43:15.830 --> 06:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
that we see here so
 
06:43:17.430 --> 06:43:17.440 align:start position:0%
um there certainly are states that are
 
06:43:19.030 --> 06:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
working on this and this is why again
 
06:43:20.628 --> 06:43:20.638 align:start position:0%
the states are putting a lot of pressure
 
06:43:23.430 --> 06:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
on epa right now to do this science
 
06:43:25.430 --> 06:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for explaining that to me
 
06:43:26.868 --> 06:43:26.878 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you
 
06:43:31.030 --> 06:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
06:43:33.030 --> 06:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
okay uh horseshoe pond was one of those
 
06:43:34.948 --> 06:43:34.958 align:start position:0%
points that were on the thing yes sir so
 
06:43:34.958 --> 06:43:35.670 align:start position:0%
points that were on the thing yes sir so
but

06:43:35.670 --> 06:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:43:38.230 --> 06:43:38.240 align:start position:0%
that one was non-detect too
 
06:43:39.910 --> 06:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
i thought hey we have a little bit of i
 
06:43:44.390 --> 06:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make sure horseshoe pond
 
06:43:45.830 --> 06:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
because i know it's one
 
06:43:48.628 --> 06:43:48.638 align:start position:0%
one fish per child per day
 
06:43:51.270 --> 06:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
yeah we we did we did not detect it
 
06:43:53.190 --> 06:43:53.200 align:start position:0%
there and if we did it was in the like
 
06:43:55.190 --> 06:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
one part per trillion or something like
 
06:43:58.468 --> 06:43:58.478 align:start position:0%
that it was very very low okay now
 
06:44:00.628 --> 06:44:00.638 align:start position:0%
bioaccumulation a lot of people probably
 
06:44:03.110 --> 06:44:03.120 align:start position:0%
haven't even heard that thing how long
 
06:44:03.120 --> 06:44:04.070 align:start position:0%
haven't even heard that thing how long
does

06:44:04.070 --> 06:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
does
 
06:44:05.910 --> 06:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
pfest stay in the in the in in the
 
06:44:08.150 --> 06:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
system of a human and or a fish
 
06:44:10.070 --> 06:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
yeah i don't know the answer to that um
 
06:44:12.390 --> 06:44:12.400 align:start position:0%
the the interesting thing
 
06:44:14.548 --> 06:44:14.558 align:start position:0%
again this this this this whole topic is
 
06:44:15.990 --> 06:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
really fascinating from a scientific
 
06:44:18.150 --> 06:44:18.160 align:start position:0%
perspective um
 
06:44:20.868 --> 06:44:20.878 align:start position:0%
the pfas compounds that we detected in
 
06:44:22.070 --> 06:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
the water
 
06:44:23.750 --> 06:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
were not the pfas
 
06:44:26.628 --> 06:44:26.638 align:start position:0%
compounds that we detected in the fish
 
06:44:28.788 --> 06:44:28.798 align:start position:0%
and we're not entirely sure whether
 
06:44:30.948 --> 06:44:30.958 align:start position:0%
that's a bioaccumulation issue whether
 
06:44:33.430 --> 06:44:33.440 align:start position:0%
that those compounds are changing as
 
06:44:36.310 --> 06:44:36.320 align:start position:0%
they go through the food chain and
 
06:44:38.230 --> 06:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
because most almost the only thing you
 
06:44:41.270 --> 06:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
ever find in fish or p is p foss
 
06:44:43.350 --> 06:44:43.360 align:start position:0%
so even if you have p4 or p5s you know
 
06:44:45.750 --> 06:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
or pffs whatever you know all the other
 
06:44:45.760 --> 06:44:47.750 align:start position:0%
or pffs whatever you know all the other
ones

06:44:47.750 --> 06:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
ones
 
06:44:49.670 --> 06:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
even if you find those you tend not to
 
06:44:51.350 --> 06:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
find them in the fish
 
06:44:53.510 --> 06:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
so it's a really
 
06:44:56.948 --> 06:44:56.958 align:start position:0%
challenging question
 
06:44:58.948 --> 06:44:58.958 align:start position:0%
and it depends on the chemical because
 
06:45:00.948 --> 06:45:00.958 align:start position:0%
some of these chemicals sit in different
 
06:45:03.190 --> 06:45:03.200 align:start position:0%
parts of the fish so this is a very
 
06:45:05.750 --> 06:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
different issue than say with mercury
 
06:45:07.750 --> 06:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
which sits in one part of the fish
 
06:45:09.750 --> 06:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
whereas pea fast sits in other parts of
 
06:45:12.150 --> 06:45:12.160 align:start position:0%
the fish and so when we look at it from
 
06:45:14.150 --> 06:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
a toxicological perspective you thinking
 
06:45:15.750 --> 06:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
about what parts of fish do people
 
06:45:17.350 --> 06:45:17.360 align:start position:0%
actually eat
 
06:45:19.830 --> 06:45:19.840 align:start position:0%
for example we have a lot we have a uh
 
06:45:22.628 --> 06:45:22.638 align:start position:0%
we have an advisory on on lobster tamale
 
06:45:24.788 --> 06:45:24.798 align:start position:0%
for pcbs because we know that that's
 
06:45:28.310 --> 06:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
where the pcbs actually accumulate is in
 
06:45:30.708 --> 06:45:30.718 align:start position:0%
the lobster tamale which is nasty and no
 
06:45:32.070 --> 06:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
one should eat it anyway
 
06:45:32.080 --> 06:45:33.110 align:start position:0%
one should eat it anyway
but

06:45:33.110 --> 06:45:33.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:45:35.030 --> 06:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
be that as it may
 
06:45:37.670 --> 06:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
be that as it may um
 
06:45:41.430 --> 06:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
it's a difficult question to answer yeah
 
06:45:45.110 --> 06:45:45.120 align:start position:0%
thank you representative smith thank you
 
06:45:46.868 --> 06:45:46.878 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you mr
 
06:45:49.030 --> 06:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
dears for taking my question which is
 
06:45:51.990 --> 06:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
more a clarification i was madly trying
 
06:45:54.868 --> 06:45:54.878 align:start position:0%
to take notes while you spoke and you
 
06:45:57.030 --> 06:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
have told us in the past and you told us
 
06:45:59.990 --> 06:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
again today that rules are in review and
 
06:46:01.590 --> 06:46:01.600 align:start position:0%
in a few months we'll have something to
 
06:46:03.510 --> 06:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
look at or somewhat you know it'll be
 
06:46:05.030 --> 06:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
it'll be happening
 
06:46:05.040 --> 06:46:06.948 align:start position:0%
it'll be happening
and

06:46:06.948 --> 06:46:06.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:46:10.868 --> 06:46:10.878 align:start position:0%
my understanding was that the rules had
 
06:46:15.190 --> 06:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
to do with amounts of pfas compounds
 
06:46:17.990 --> 06:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
in surface water is that correct
 
06:46:19.670 --> 06:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
yeah so this again this this gets back
 
06:46:21.910 --> 06:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
to the very confusing aspects of
 
06:46:24.230 --> 06:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
of surface water quality criteria which
 
06:46:26.628 --> 06:46:26.638 align:start position:0%
are have right there's nine different
 
06:46:28.548 --> 06:46:28.558 align:start position:0%
criteria that can apply to any water
 
06:46:30.548 --> 06:46:30.558 align:start position:0%
body it's not like a drinking water
 
06:46:32.230 --> 06:46:32.240 align:start position:0%
criteria which has there's a number it's
 
06:46:33.430 --> 06:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
drinking water
 
06:46:36.070 --> 06:46:36.080 align:start position:0%
this this has nine different ways that
 
06:46:39.510 --> 06:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
we can look at it so the mcls well i'll
 
06:46:41.910 --> 06:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
try to make this as clear as i possibly
 
06:46:41.920 --> 06:46:43.030 align:start position:0%
try to make this as clear as i possibly
can

06:46:43.030 --> 06:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
can
 
06:46:45.270 --> 06:46:45.280 align:start position:0%
when we adopt the mcls the drinking
 
06:46:47.270 --> 06:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
water mcl's that were already developed
 
06:46:48.788 --> 06:46:48.798 align:start position:0%
for the four compounds for which they
 
06:46:50.150 --> 06:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
were developed
 
06:46:52.708 --> 06:46:52.718 align:start position:0%
when we adopt those they will apply to
 
06:46:56.788 --> 06:46:56.798 align:start position:0%
surface waters within 20 miles upstream
 
06:47:00.708 --> 06:47:00.718 align:start position:0%
of a drinking water intake
 
06:47:03.430 --> 06:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
so they will only apply to those waters
 
06:47:05.750 --> 06:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
they won't apply to any other waters in
 
06:47:08.548 --> 06:47:08.558 align:start position:0%
the state except for those which are 20
 
06:47:10.150 --> 06:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
miles upstream
 
06:47:13.350 --> 06:47:13.360 align:start position:0%
of a drinking water intake
 
06:47:15.590 --> 06:47:15.600 align:start position:0%
but it will be the number in the surface
 
06:47:17.830 --> 06:47:17.840 align:start position:0%
water will be
 
06:47:19.590 --> 06:47:19.600 align:start position:0%
that mcl
 
06:47:19.600 --> 06:47:20.390 align:start position:0%
that mcl
for

06:47:20.390 --> 06:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:47:23.590 --> 06:47:23.600 align:start position:0%
again the purposes of drinking water so
 
06:47:25.910 --> 06:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
it does it provides sort of a belt and
 
06:47:28.230 --> 06:47:28.240 align:start position:0%
suspenders approach
 
06:47:28.240 --> 06:47:29.110 align:start position:0%
suspenders approach
to

06:47:29.110 --> 06:47:29.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:47:31.190 --> 06:47:31.200 align:start position:0%
drinking water protection because it's
 
06:47:32.628 --> 06:47:32.638 align:start position:0%
already and this is one of the things we
 
06:47:34.948 --> 06:47:34.958 align:start position:0%
talked about last time is that the
 
06:47:37.110 --> 06:47:37.120 align:start position:0%
drinking water system is already
 
06:47:37.120 --> 06:47:38.708 align:start position:0%
drinking water system is already
regulated

06:47:38.708 --> 06:47:38.718 align:start position:0%
regulated
 
06:47:41.830 --> 06:47:41.840 align:start position:0%
by these mcls right you can't have more
 
06:47:44.310 --> 06:47:44.320 align:start position:0%
than this so if it's in your surface
 
06:47:44.320 --> 06:47:45.430 align:start position:0%
than this so if it's in your surface
water

06:47:45.430 --> 06:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
water
 
06:47:47.510 --> 06:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
at levels that are higher than that you
 
06:47:49.750 --> 06:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
still can't serve it up to people
 
06:47:51.350 --> 06:47:51.360 align:start position:0%
because they're testing and they have to
 
06:47:53.030 --> 06:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
make sure that they're so they're
 
06:47:54.868 --> 06:47:54.878 align:start position:0%
already going to be cleaning that water
 
06:47:56.548 --> 06:47:56.558 align:start position:0%
before it goes out to drinking water
 
06:47:59.670 --> 06:47:59.680 align:start position:0%
systems so that's that's the implication
 
06:48:01.670 --> 06:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
of this is that it is really truly a
 
06:48:03.590 --> 06:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
belt and suspenders approach to drinking
 
06:48:06.708 --> 06:48:06.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:08.468 --> 06:48:08.478 align:start position:0%
thank you does that answer the question
 
06:48:10.468 --> 06:48:10.478 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry yeah well because the notes i
 
06:48:13.030 --> 06:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
had were mcl's apply only to drinking
 
06:48:14.948 --> 06:48:14.958 align:start position:0%
water so this explains you're saying
 
06:48:17.430 --> 06:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
that if the surface waters are
 
06:48:17.440 --> 06:48:18.868 align:start position:0%
that if the surface waters are
uh

06:48:18.868 --> 06:48:18.878 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:48:22.310 --> 06:48:22.320 align:start position:0%
if if there's drinking water
 
06:48:22.320 --> 06:48:23.350 align:start position:0%
if if there's drinking water
downstream

06:48:23.350 --> 06:48:23.360 align:start position:0%
downstream
 
06:48:24.868 --> 06:48:24.878 align:start position:0%
20 miles
 
06:48:28.548 --> 06:48:28.558 align:start position:0%
then those mcls would apply yes okay
 
06:48:30.788 --> 06:48:30.798 align:start position:0%
right exactly precisely
 
06:48:30.798 --> 06:48:32.310 align:start position:0%
right exactly precisely
yep

06:48:32.310 --> 06:48:32.320 align:start position:0%
yep
 
06:48:34.150 --> 06:48:34.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:48:38.868 --> 06:48:38.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:40.468 --> 06:48:40.478 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you mr deus for your
 
06:48:41.910 --> 06:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you all if you have
 
06:48:43.110 --> 06:48:43.120 align:start position:0%
questions afterwards please don't
 
06:48:45.110 --> 06:48:45.120 align:start position:0%
hesitate to email me or call me thank
 
06:48:57.670 --> 06:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:00.788 --> 06:49:00.798 align:start position:0%
my last pink card in opposition mr boyd
 
06:49:10.548 --> 06:49:10.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:12.628 --> 06:49:12.638 align:start position:0%
hey good afternoon
 
06:49:14.150 --> 06:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
vice chairman and committee thank you
 
06:49:14.160 --> 06:49:14.868 align:start position:0%
vice chairman and committee thank you
for

06:49:14.868 --> 06:49:14.878 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:49:16.390 --> 06:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
taking the time to
 
06:49:18.468 --> 06:49:18.478 align:start position:0%
to review the testimony that we've
 
06:49:20.628 --> 06:49:20.638 align:start position:0%
submitted and to allow me to few minutes
 
06:49:23.030 --> 06:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
to speak my name is boyd smith i'm the
 
06:49:25.430 --> 06:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
president and ceo of the new hampshire
 
06:49:27.350 --> 06:49:27.360 align:start position:0%
water works association
 
06:49:29.430 --> 06:49:29.440 align:start position:0%
and we represent the public drinking
 
06:49:31.430 --> 06:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
water utilities and providers in the
 
06:49:33.190 --> 06:49:33.200 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
06:49:33.200 --> 06:49:35.510 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
um

06:49:35.510 --> 06:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:49:37.190 --> 06:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
again you've got more technical
 
06:49:38.708 --> 06:49:38.718 align:start position:0%
information that i can't build on
 
06:49:40.310 --> 06:49:40.320 align:start position:0%
anything that mr deer's provided he's
 
06:49:42.150 --> 06:49:42.160 align:start position:0%
clearly an expert in the field
 
06:49:44.070 --> 06:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
i should say anecdotally it's pleasure
 
06:49:46.390 --> 06:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
to work with ds and partnership on
 
06:49:48.150 --> 06:49:48.160 align:start position:0%
clean water issues
 
06:49:50.150 --> 06:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
so there's just a couple things i wanted
 
06:49:52.390 --> 06:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
to touch on i want to reinforce
 
06:49:54.070 --> 06:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
i think what i said last week and i'll
 
06:49:55.590 --> 06:49:55.600 align:start position:0%
say next week if the opportunity is
 
06:49:55.600 --> 06:49:56.708 align:start position:0%
say next week if the opportunity is
required

06:49:56.708 --> 06:49:56.718 align:start position:0%
required
 
06:49:59.350 --> 06:49:59.360 align:start position:0%
is that the drinking water industry is a
 
06:50:01.590 --> 06:50:01.600 align:start position:0%
we see ourselves as
 
06:50:03.350 --> 06:50:03.360 align:start position:0%
health providers really
 
06:50:05.670 --> 06:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
uh our job is to create a
 
06:50:08.230 --> 06:50:08.240 align:start position:0%
product that you can safely consume
 
06:50:10.310 --> 06:50:10.320 align:start position:0%
every day for your entire life and you
 
06:50:12.628 --> 06:50:12.638 align:start position:0%
know not get sick so uh
 
06:50:15.190 --> 06:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
the people that work in this industry uh
 
06:50:17.030 --> 06:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
take it very seriously it's it's an
 
06:50:18.788 --> 06:50:18.798 align:start position:0%
honor to serve with them um they're
 
06:50:19.990 --> 06:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
really mission driven and that's the
 
06:50:21.910 --> 06:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
mission clean water
 
06:50:24.070 --> 06:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
um we have to use regulations like we're
 
06:50:25.510 --> 06:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
talking about today we have to use
 
06:50:26.788 --> 06:50:26.798 align:start position:0%
standards we've got to come up with
 
06:50:30.150 --> 06:50:30.160 align:start position:0%
numbers to treat towards
 
06:50:33.030 --> 06:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
for the for this system
 
06:50:34.310 --> 06:50:34.320 align:start position:0%
you have to know what you're treating
 
06:50:36.628 --> 06:50:36.638 align:start position:0%
too to develop the treatment processes
 
06:50:38.468 --> 06:50:38.478 align:start position:0%
and the monitoring processes
 
06:50:42.390 --> 06:50:42.400 align:start position:0%
and for all the various standards
 
06:50:42.400 --> 06:50:44.390 align:start position:0%
and for all the various standards
that

06:50:44.390 --> 06:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:50:46.788 --> 06:50:46.798 align:start position:0%
that are put into law there's a lot of
 
06:50:48.628 --> 06:50:48.638 align:start position:0%
work behind them
 
06:50:51.030 --> 06:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
i mean as you heard from mr dears
 
06:50:52.708 --> 06:50:52.718 align:start position:0%
assessing the
 
06:50:54.628 --> 06:50:54.638 align:start position:0%
standard for drinking water is is one
 
06:50:56.150 --> 06:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
you throw surface water and you've got
 
06:50:57.830 --> 06:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
nine it just gets exponentially
 
06:50:57.840 --> 06:50:59.270 align:start position:0%
nine it just gets exponentially
complicated

06:50:59.270 --> 06:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
06:51:01.590 --> 06:51:01.600 align:start position:0%
um i i've worked in has waste
 
06:51:03.750 --> 06:51:03.760 align:start position:0%
investigations and and cleanup for
 
06:51:05.750 --> 06:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
probably better part of 20 years a
 
06:51:07.990 --> 06:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
little bit in the past but i i literally
 
06:51:10.548 --> 06:51:10.558 align:start position:0%
swam in these waters
 
06:51:12.628 --> 06:51:12.638 align:start position:0%
my point being is the process for
 
06:51:12.638 --> 06:51:13.910 align:start position:0%
my point being is the process for
determining

06:51:13.910 --> 06:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
determining
 
06:51:15.670 --> 06:51:15.680 align:start position:0%
standards is really important because
 
06:51:16.948 --> 06:51:16.958 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of rides on it you know
 
06:51:19.350 --> 06:51:19.360 align:start position:0%
our health rides on it there are cost
 
06:51:21.910 --> 06:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
implications uh huge cost implications
 
06:51:23.350 --> 06:51:23.360 align:start position:0%
which most people by the way aren't
 
06:51:27.110 --> 06:51:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:29.190 --> 06:51:29.200 align:start position:0%
and there's technology as well sometimes
 
06:51:31.030 --> 06:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
we don't have the technology to treat
 
06:51:33.590 --> 06:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
what's bad for us and that's a tough one
 
06:51:35.030 --> 06:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
but i want to reassure you that people
 
06:51:36.628 --> 06:51:36.638 align:start position:0%
that work in this industry
 
06:51:38.628 --> 06:51:38.638 align:start position:0%
are professionals and they take you know
 
06:51:39.990 --> 06:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
the treatment of
 
06:51:41.430 --> 06:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
their drinking water incredibly
 
06:51:43.830 --> 06:51:43.840 align:start position:0%
seriously so this is a surface water
 
06:51:45.430 --> 06:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
standard you might wonder why i'm here
 
06:51:47.830 --> 06:51:47.840 align:start position:0%
for you know for a drinking water uh
 
06:51:50.390 --> 06:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
organization but the majority uh the
 
06:51:53.030 --> 06:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
biggest systems uh pull water uh their
 
06:51:55.270 --> 06:51:55.280 align:start position:0%
source water out of out of surface water
 
06:51:57.590 --> 06:51:57.600 align:start position:0%
and the merrimack's a big one uh nashua
 
06:51:59.670 --> 06:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
pentachuck is gets their
 
06:52:01.670 --> 06:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
source water manchester's adding seven
 
06:52:03.670 --> 06:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
million gallons a day out of
 
06:52:06.390 --> 06:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
uh the merrimack um concord surface
 
06:52:08.390 --> 06:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
water rochester portsmouth dovers and
 
06:52:08.400 --> 06:52:09.270 align:start position:0%
water rochester portsmouth dovers and
mix

06:52:09.270 --> 06:52:09.280 align:start position:0%
mix
 
06:52:11.590 --> 06:52:11.600 align:start position:0%
surface water is the principal source
 
06:52:14.628 --> 06:52:14.638 align:start position:0%
for our largest population centers
 
06:52:16.230 --> 06:52:16.240 align:start position:0%
i know i'm rambling a little bit but i
 
06:52:17.510 --> 06:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
think what i want to close on that
 
06:52:19.430 --> 06:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
particular point is
 
06:52:22.390 --> 06:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
we need to use the established processes
 
06:52:25.430 --> 06:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
these risk risk processes
 
06:52:26.788 --> 06:52:26.798 align:start position:0%
risk-based health-based
 
06:52:29.270 --> 06:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
feasibility-based processes that the des
 
06:52:32.310 --> 06:52:32.320 align:start position:0%
is using that the epa is using to create
 
06:52:32.320 --> 06:52:33.830 align:start position:0%
is using that the epa is using to create
a

06:52:33.830 --> 06:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:52:33.840 --> 06:52:35.030 align:start position:0%
a
science

06:52:35.030 --> 06:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
science
 
06:52:38.150 --> 06:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
justifiable feasible health standards
 
06:52:40.548 --> 06:52:40.558 align:start position:0%
and my understanding is that related to
 
06:52:44.070 --> 06:52:44.080 align:start position:0%
this bill that's currently underway
 
06:52:46.230 --> 06:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
so i'd say let those processes work you
 
06:52:48.150 --> 06:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
know watch the processes support those
 
06:52:50.310 --> 06:52:50.320 align:start position:0%
processes if there's a need
 
06:52:52.868 --> 06:52:52.878 align:start position:0%
or the sense of urgency
 
06:52:54.548 --> 06:52:54.558 align:start position:0%
i would say support the processes that
 
06:52:56.708 --> 06:52:56.718 align:start position:0%
have been established for decades now to
 
06:52:58.548 --> 06:52:58.558 align:start position:0%
set these uh health-based risk-based
 
06:52:58.558 --> 06:53:00.788 align:start position:0%
set these uh health-based risk-based
standards

06:53:00.788 --> 06:53:00.798 align:start position:0%
standards
 
06:53:04.150 --> 06:53:04.160 align:start position:0%
more anecdotally anecdotally i would say
 
06:53:06.230 --> 06:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
i think i understand the pressure that
 
06:53:07.990 --> 06:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
we're all under and perhaps you more as
 
06:53:11.190 --> 06:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
representatives uh to do something you
 
06:53:13.350 --> 06:53:13.360 align:start position:0%
know this pifa stuff in particular is
 
06:53:15.110 --> 06:53:15.120 align:start position:0%
it's like a bomb you know it's just it
 
06:53:17.270 --> 06:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
blew off in our backyard it's been
 
06:53:18.788 --> 06:53:18.798 align:start position:0%
around us for years most people didn't
 
06:53:21.030 --> 06:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
know it and now you know in large part
 
06:53:22.468 --> 06:53:22.478 align:start position:0%
thanks to d yes we're finding it all
 
06:53:23.830 --> 06:53:23.840 align:start position:0%
over the place i think ted said they've
 
06:53:26.230 --> 06:53:26.240 align:start position:0%
got 6 000 wells they've tested and they
 
06:53:28.310 --> 06:53:28.320 align:start position:0%
do more every year
 
06:53:30.708 --> 06:53:30.718 align:start position:0%
it's really scary stuff and we want to
 
06:53:32.868 --> 06:53:32.878 align:start position:0%
do something you know we want to attack
 
06:53:34.070 --> 06:53:34.080 align:start position:0%
this problem
 
06:53:34.080 --> 06:53:34.868 align:start position:0%
this problem
uh

06:53:34.868 --> 06:53:34.878 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:53:37.190 --> 06:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
communicating to um my neighbors you
 
06:53:39.110 --> 06:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
know my friends your constituents that
 
06:53:40.628 --> 06:53:40.638 align:start position:0%
this stuff takes time and it's
 
06:53:43.110 --> 06:53:43.120 align:start position:0%
complicated is not an easy sell it's
 
06:53:45.270 --> 06:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
something as an association we're trying
 
06:53:46.788 --> 06:53:46.798 align:start position:0%
to figure out how to do
 
06:53:48.628 --> 06:53:48.638 align:start position:0%
but it has to be done because we can't
 
06:53:49.910 --> 06:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
just jump at
 
06:53:51.430 --> 06:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
whatever numbers are flying around
 
06:53:52.868 --> 06:53:52.878 align:start position:0%
before they're established because there
 
06:53:55.190 --> 06:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
are long term and substantial
 
06:53:56.868 --> 06:53:56.878 align:start position:0%
ramifications and that's one of the
 
06:53:58.788 --> 06:53:58.798 align:start position:0%
messages i wanted to bring to you today
 
06:54:00.788 --> 06:54:00.798 align:start position:0%
and one of the reasons that as an
 
06:54:03.190 --> 06:54:03.200 align:start position:0%
association we oppose the bill
 
06:54:05.350 --> 06:54:05.360 align:start position:0%
we've got to use that process and if
 
06:54:06.948 --> 06:54:06.958 align:start position:0%
there's anything that we can do as an
 
06:54:08.788 --> 06:54:08.798 align:start position:0%
association one of the things we focus
 
06:54:11.510 --> 06:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
on is trying to help consumers of water
 
06:54:13.430 --> 06:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
understand these things is that going to
 
06:54:15.830 --> 06:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
solve the issue of you know of pfas
 
06:54:17.270 --> 06:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
whose numbers are getting lower and
 
06:54:18.788 --> 06:54:18.798 align:start position:0%
lower as far as the threat goes no it
 
06:54:21.110 --> 06:54:21.120 align:start position:0%
isn't it's not an easy problem
