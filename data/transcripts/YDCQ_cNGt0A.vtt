00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 align:start position:0%
uh good morning and welcome to the work
 
00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 align:start position:0%
work session on House Bill
 
00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 align:start position:0%
378 um regarding the information
 
00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:15.879 align:start position:0%
provided to survivors of sexual assault
 
00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 align:start position:0%
regarding their um existing rights when
 
00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 align:start position:0%
we last met we had had an amendment that
 
00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
I did include for anybody everybody here
 
00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:28.879 align:start position:0%
that was Amendment 2357 H um the way
 
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 align:start position:0%
that we had moved in the subcommittee
 
00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:34.879 align:start position:0%
was to move um to have an information
 
00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 align:start position:0%
information specifically provided to
 
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 align:start position:0%
survivors of sexual assault so that
 
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 align:start position:0%
right after they had been stripped of
 
00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 align:start position:0%
that power and autonomy and their rights
 
00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:45.879 align:start position:0%
during their
 
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 align:start position:0%
victimization they started that
 
00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 align:start position:0%
transition to a Survivor by knowing
 
00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:53.079 align:start position:0%
their rights as a survivor of sexual
 
00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 align:start position:0%
assault we had spelled out a lot of the
 
00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 align:start position:0%
information that was included in the 115
 
00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 align:start position:0%
page guidance document from the
 
00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice and the attorney
 
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 align:start position:0%
general which outlines those rights the
 
00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
times for collection um and everything
 
00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 align:start position:0%
else that a victim that a Survivor
 
00:04:15.429 --> 00:04:15.439 align:start position:0%
because once you are heard you become a
 
00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 align:start position:0%
you you move towards being a Survivor
 
00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 align:start position:0%
instead of a victim for that Survivor to
 
00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
understand what rights they have so that
 
00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 align:start position:0%
they can make sure that their rights are
 
00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 align:start position:0%
fully protected and begin that healing
 
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 align:start position:0%
process as we did that we got some
 
00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:33.759 align:start position:0%
feedback from the Coalition um that
 
00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
spoke about how if we put those details
 
00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 align:start position:0%
into law when there's the next revision
 
00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 align:start position:0%
of the guidelines then we'd have to come
 
00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 align:start position:0%
back and do that in law um we have an
 
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
amendment that would put this
 
00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 align:start position:0%
requirement into Ru making and make it
 
00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 align:start position:0%
and it would charge the Department of
 
00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 align:start position:0%
Justice with adopting rules to create a
 
00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:57.039 align:start position:0%
document or documents summarized and I'm
 
00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
reading off of this amendment it's going
 
00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 align:start position:0%
to be hot off the presses as soon as it
 
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 align:start position:0%
is released from OS it will be printed
 
00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 align:start position:0%
and come down to us but it is in this
 
00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 align:start position:0%
format um it would say it says that the
 
00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 align:start position:0%
department yes Madam chair perhaps our
 
00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
researcher could step down the hall and
 
00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 align:start position:0%
make copies there are copies and they've
 
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 align:start position:0%
already been distributed for our guests
 
00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
yes oh okay yes they're already sitting
 
00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
there you said that it hot off the
 
00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 align:start position:0%
presses will be this amendment right now
 
00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 align:start position:0%
it's just in the text form it literally
 
00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:28.639 align:start position:0%
is in the final review this one we're
 
00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
not consider in that was the one that we
 
00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 align:start position:0%
considered at the last work session and
 
00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 align:start position:0%
I'm speaking to our Evolution from that
 
00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 align:start position:0%
amendment to where we are now and uh
 
00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:39.199 align:start position:0%
that this amendment in official form
 
00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 align:start position:0%
will be coming this the piece of paper
 
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
we should be working on I'm looking at
 
00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 align:start position:0%
both of them showing you where we
 
00:05:45.309 --> 00:05:45.319 align:start position:0%
started and where we are now I'm trying
 
00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 align:start position:0%
to give you a a walk with a crosswalk
 
00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:49.880 align:start position:0%
here thank you so on this new one the
 
00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:51.639 align:start position:0%
official one will be coming down
 
00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
momentarily um in section one um Roman
 
00:05:56.749 --> 00:05:56.759 align:start position:0%
the new Roman 2 says that the Department
 
00:05:59.469 --> 00:05:59.479 align:start position:0%
of Justice shall adopt rules pursuant to
 
00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 align:start position:0%
create a document or document
 
00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
summarizing the information required by
 
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
the sexual assault survivors rights so
 
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
that victims of sexual assault
 
00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:09.199 align:start position:0%
Healthcare Providers and the general
 
00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.080 align:start position:0%
public can easily access the key points
 
00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:13.599 align:start position:0%
of the protocols required in paragraph
 
00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
one which is that 115 page document
 
00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
necessary to protect the rights of
 
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
sexual assault Survivors by placing this
 
00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
into rulemaking Authority it will have
 
00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:23.720 align:start position:0%
an opportunity for review for all
 
00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and for everybody who is a
 
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:27.720 align:start position:0%
Survivor as well to make sure that that
 
00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:30.080 align:start position:0%
information that they needed in that
 
00:06:34.029 --> 00:06:34.039 align:start position:0%
moment of need is available um to the to
 
00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:35.639 align:start position:0%
anybody else when they go through that
 
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
experience and it also means that it
 
00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:40.280 align:start position:0%
will be easily adaptable when there are
 
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
new rules under 21 M8 D1 um which is a
 
00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:47.120 align:start position:0%
standardized protocol kit and domestic
 
00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
violence protocol that this form can be
 
00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:51.400 align:start position:0%
changed and updated this document can be
 
00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:58.629 --> 00:06:58.639 align:start position:0%
time if you look to where we and and so
 
00:07:01.869 --> 00:07:01.879 align:start position:0%
then this form is referenced um in the
 
00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:03.800 align:start position:0%
sexual assault survivors rights where
 
00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:06.479 align:start position:0%
you're they're already have the right to
 
00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:08.120 align:start position:0%
be informed of writing a polici
 
00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:09.400 align:start position:0%
governing the collection and
 
00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:11.120 align:start position:0%
preservation of sexual assault evidence
 
00:07:13.029 --> 00:07:13.039 align:start position:0%
kits it just adds including the
 
00:07:17.749 --> 00:07:17.759 align:start position:0%
information required by um
 
00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:21.560 align:start position:0%
194 it we also um had the definition
 
00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:24.440 align:start position:0%
about a sexual assault Survivor I really
 
00:07:26.909 --> 00:07:26.919 align:start position:0%
hadn't understood some of the push back
 
00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
on it until I recognized that what
 
00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
myself and others call attempted rape we
 
00:07:34.909 --> 00:07:34.919 align:start position:0%
call that because in the process of
 
00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:37.160 align:start position:0%
trying to rape somebody they were groped
 
00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
which is a misdemeanor sexual assault
 
00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:41.800 align:start position:0%
that that terminology may not be
 
00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:44.840 align:start position:0%
acknowledged by all so in breaking down
 
00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:48.280 align:start position:0%
the um what a sexual assault Survivor is
 
00:07:50.749 --> 00:07:50.759 align:start position:0%
instead of putting those categories
 
00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:53.800 align:start position:0%
ahead of the rsas it says that a sexual
 
00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:56.080 align:start position:0%
assault Survivor means any individual
 
00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
who asserts that they have been subject
 
00:07:59.710 --> 00:07:59.720 align:start position:0%
to an offense under the statute es for
 
00:08:02.589 --> 00:08:02.599 align:start position:0%
aggravated fonus fonus and misdemeanor
 
00:08:05.309 --> 00:08:05.319 align:start position:0%
sexual assault including but not limited
 
00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:07.000 align:start position:0%
to the penetrative or non-penetrative
 
00:08:09.029 --> 00:08:09.039 align:start position:0%
sexual assault because if there's not
 
00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:11.000 align:start position:0%
penetration but there's sexual contact
 
00:08:12.589 --> 00:08:12.599 align:start position:0%
that is the misdemeanor or
 
00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
administrating of a drug or other
 
00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:16.280 align:start position:0%
intoxicating substance as a part of a
 
00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:18.360 align:start position:0%
sexual assault which falls under the
 
00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
reference statutes that is already in
 
00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:23.000 align:start position:0%
law that if somebody has drugged you in
 
00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:25.840 align:start position:0%
order to have sexual contact or more
 
00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:29.400 align:start position:0%
with you that is that is against the law
 
00:08:31.469 --> 00:08:31.479 align:start position:0%
that is already included in the
 
00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:34.240 align:start position:0%
standardized protocol um and then it
 
00:08:37.949 --> 00:08:37.959 align:start position:0%
also for those those people who don't
 
00:08:39.469 --> 00:08:39.479 align:start position:0%
know where to go and don't know what to
 
00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:41.360 align:start position:0%
do and all they know how to say is that
 
00:08:44.269 --> 00:08:44.279 align:start position:0%
that somebody tried to rape me that it
 
00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
says that an individual reporting an
 
00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:47.800 align:start position:0%
attempted rape who asserts sexual
 
00:08:50.829 --> 00:08:50.839 align:start position:0%
contact as defined and described shall
 
00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:52.640 align:start position:0%
not be denied survivors rights because
 
00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:54.240 align:start position:0%
of a lack of knowledge of the correct
 
00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
legal terminology so that is just to
 
00:08:59.350 --> 00:08:59.360 align:start position:0%
make sure that everybody is aware of
 
00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
their rights and they can begin that
 
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:01.670 align:start position:0%
their rights and they can begin that
healing

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
healing
 
00:09:04.389 --> 00:09:04.399 align:start position:0%
process in uh section four of here it's
 
00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:06.920 align:start position:0%
at the bottom of this new page um it
 
00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
adds the Attorney General would need to
 
00:09:11.269 --> 00:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
post prominently that document and it
 
00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:13.320 align:start position:0%
outlines what it needs to have that is
 
00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:15.720 align:start position:0%
the rights under the section and under
 
00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:18.440 align:start position:0%
the um Regular victim's rights and the
 
00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:20.720 align:start position:0%
policy is cons governing the collection
 
00:09:22.269 --> 00:09:22.279 align:start position:0%
and preservation of a sexual assault
 
00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:24.680 align:start position:0%
evidence collection kit as established
 
00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:27.160 align:start position:0%
including how long after the assault the
 
00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:28.440 align:start position:0%
different types of samples may be
 
00:09:30.949 --> 00:09:30.959 align:start position:0%
collected or generally collected and the
 
00:09:32.509 --> 00:09:32.519 align:start position:0%
fact that bringing your clothes and the
 
00:09:34.269 --> 00:09:34.279 align:start position:0%
other things you had with you are
 
00:09:36.389 --> 00:09:36.399 align:start position:0%
valuable because they may have evidence
 
00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:38.720 align:start position:0%
and if a vict if a Survivor doesn't know
 
00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:41.360 align:start position:0%
that that's one of the reasons why so
 
00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:43.160 align:start position:0%
few of these assaults are actually
 
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
successfully prosecuted in New
 
00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:49.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and then um and then also
 
00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
including that information about how if
 
00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:52.600 align:start position:0%
you say that it's attempted rape what
 
00:09:54.829 --> 00:09:54.839 align:start position:0%
makes it a misdemeanor sexual assault so
 
00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
that you actually understand if that
 
00:09:57.990 --> 00:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
line that legal line has been crossed or
 
00:10:00.509 --> 00:10:00.519 align:start position:0%
not um and and then finally it requires
 
00:10:02.389 --> 00:10:02.399 align:start position:0%
a healthc care provider law enforcement
 
00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
officer or other employee of an entity
 
00:10:06.269 --> 00:10:06.279 align:start position:0%
listed in paragraph one who in the
 
00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:08.240 align:start position:0%
course of their professional Rel
 
00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:10.040 align:start position:0%
responsibilities has contact with a
 
00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:12.160 align:start position:0%
sexual assault Survivor shall provide
 
00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
the individual with a document intended
 
00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:16.200 align:start position:0%
for sexual assault survivors provided by
 
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General pursuant to
 
00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:20.920 align:start position:0%
paragraph three or an internally created
 
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
document which contains at minimum the
 
00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
same material information the reason for
 
00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:26.720 align:start position:0%
allowing them to do that is that a lot
 
00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:28.360 align:start position:0%
of times when you go to the hospital you
 
00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:30.040 align:start position:0%
end up getting a out that looks like
 
00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
everybody else's but it's specific to
 
00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:35.320 align:start position:0%
those whatever condition you're in for
 
00:10:37.069 --> 00:10:37.079 align:start position:0%
you can just have that boring stack of
 
00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
papers that looks like you might be in
 
00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:41.800 align:start position:0%
for an for appendectomy but it'll have
 
00:10:43.629 --> 00:10:43.639 align:start position:0%
your rights included there in the same
 
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
boring format so that the person sitting
 
00:10:48.829 --> 00:10:48.839 align:start position:0%
next to you won't know why you're
 
00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
there so um with that I I would like to
 
00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
know if there's if um any of the
 
00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
committee members have any
 
00:10:59.470 --> 00:10:59.480 align:start position:0%
questions subcommittee members
 
00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:00.710 align:start position:0%

the work you've put in on this um and I
 
00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
I would very much like to hear from
 
00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
members of the Coalition who are here
 
00:11:12.269 --> 00:11:12.279 align:start position:0%
today because one of the reasons that we
 
00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:15.240 align:start position:0%
had yet another hearing yet work session
 
00:11:17.629 --> 00:11:17.639 align:start position:0%
it's not a hearing uh was to get their
 
00:11:20.269 --> 00:11:20.279 align:start position:0%
input so absolutely thank you do that I
 
00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:21.880 align:start position:0%
would appreciate it I am definitely
 
00:11:23.269 --> 00:11:23.279 align:start position:0%
planning on calling on them I just
 
00:11:24.509 --> 00:11:24.519 align:start position:0%
wanted to know if there was anything
 
00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
initially from a member of the committee
 
00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
um and with that if there's anybody here
 
00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
um that wanted to speak to this amend
 
00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:50.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:52.720 align:start position:0%
amended good morning Madam chair members
 
00:11:55.269 --> 00:11:55.279 align:start position:0%
of the committee um my name is Pamela KY
 
00:11:57.069 --> 00:11:57.079 align:start position:0%
and I am the public policy specialist at
 
00:11:58.350 --> 00:11:58.360 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Coalition against
 
00:12:00.829 --> 00:12:00.839 align:start position:0%
domestic in sexual violence and and I'm
 
00:12:03.629 --> 00:12:03.639 align:start position:0%
here today um with our uh co-director of
 
00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:05.160 align:start position:0%
the sexual assault nurse examiner
 
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
program Janet Carol who can speak to
 
00:12:09.509 --> 00:12:09.519 align:start position:0%
some of the technical aspects of this
 
00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
bill I think unfortunately I would just
 
00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
seeing this amendment now I would need
 
00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:15.800 align:start position:0%
to be able to confer um with some of our
 
00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
colleagues and partners in this work um
 
00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
to get a better sense of what how that
 
00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
would work um in the jail car process um
 
00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:25.160 align:start position:0%
but I think we still have um some
 
00:12:26.949 --> 00:12:26.959 align:start position:0%
questions and concerns and would just
 
00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:28.360 align:start position:0%
really appreciate this to be further
 
00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
studied but I'm happy to turn it over to
 
00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:38.269 --> 00:12:38.279 align:start position:0%
um as you guys are aware there's there's
 
00:12:40.949 --> 00:12:40.959 align:start position:0%
several um protocols with the Attorney
 
00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
General's office
 
00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
that that go are for sexual assault okay
 
00:12:48.949 --> 00:12:48.959 align:start position:0%
there's a model protocol which is a
 
00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
multi-disciplinary protocol it's it's
 
00:12:53.629 --> 00:12:53.639 align:start position:0%
over a 100 Pages um and that might have
 
00:12:55.189 --> 00:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
been what was referenced at the last
 
00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
meeting I don't know or this last
 
00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:00.040 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting um in that section
 
00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
it does um refer the medical folks
 
00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
there's only a couple of pages in it
 
00:13:07.069 --> 00:13:07.079 align:start position:0%
regarding medical uh it refers you to
 
00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
115 page document which clearly defines
 
00:13:12.949 --> 00:13:12.959 align:start position:0%
the process for collecting um drug
 
00:13:14.949 --> 00:13:14.959 align:start position:0%
facilitated sexual assault specimens
 
00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:18.040 align:start position:0%
should that occur um I think it's
 
00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
important to know that um patients
 
00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:25.720 align:start position:0%
present with many different histories um
 
00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:28.120 align:start position:0%
if a patient came in and said I feel
 
00:13:30.509 --> 00:13:30.519 align:start position:0%
like I was drugged but there's no way
 
00:13:34.829 --> 00:13:34.839 align:start position:0%
anything occurred whether that be I um I
 
00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
was walking with my friends and that's
 
00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:38.440 align:start position:0%
when I started to feel funny I was in a
 
00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
safe place there's no way anything
 
00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:42.240 align:start position:0%
occurred it wouldn't
 
00:13:45.269 --> 00:13:45.279 align:start position:0%
necess uh a sexual assault evidence
 
00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
collection kit okay um if same type of
 
00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
thing is well no I was able to hail a
 
00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:54.240 align:start position:0%
Uber or a taxi and you know no physical
 
00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
contact would have occurred it would not
 
00:13:58.590 --> 00:13:58.600 align:start position:0%
necess necessitate I can't pronounce
 
00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
that word um a sexual Sal evidence
 
00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:04.440 align:start position:0%
collection kit okay um if a patient was
 
00:14:06.949 --> 00:14:06.959 align:start position:0%
to say you know I feel like I was
 
00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:09.240 align:start position:0%
drugged or I know I was drugged um but I
 
00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
was able to get away I was able to you
 
00:14:13.189 --> 00:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
know lock myself in a secured area or
 
00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:14.920 align:start position:0%
get to my neighbor's home or something
 
00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
like that I know nothing
 
00:14:19.189 --> 00:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
occurred a sexual assault evidence
 
00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
collection kit would not be completed in
 
00:14:23.829 --> 00:14:23.839 align:start position:0%
those times but if a patient came and
 
00:14:26.749 --> 00:14:26.759 align:start position:0%
said I think I was drugged and I don't
 
00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
recall this time to this time and I
 
00:14:30.749 --> 00:14:30.759 align:start position:0%
don't know who had access to my body or
 
00:14:33.629 --> 00:14:33.639 align:start position:0%
if anything could have been done 100%
 
00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:35.320 align:start position:0%
this kit would be opened and would be
 
00:14:37.069 --> 00:14:37.079 align:start position:0%
provided to every single patient you
 
00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:40.120 align:start position:0%
know if they wanted that option and that
 
00:14:42.949 --> 00:14:42.959 align:start position:0%
is clearly written in the medical
 
00:14:45.389 --> 00:14:45.399 align:start position:0%
protocol um that the Attorney General's
 
00:14:48.389 --> 00:14:48.399 align:start position:0%
office has um and it's it's followed at
 
00:14:48.399 --> 00:14:50.230 align:start position:0%
office has um and it's it's followed at
the

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:50.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:53.800 align:start position:0%
hospitals sorry representative
 
00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
kman thank you madam chair and thank you
 
00:14:58.949 --> 00:14:58.959 align:start position:0%
for being here um and thank you for
 
00:15:00.749 --> 00:15:00.759 align:start position:0%
explaining those um examples of
 
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:03.240 align:start position:0%
scenarios where a collection kit would
 
00:15:05.389 --> 00:15:05.399 align:start position:0%
be open and utilized and where it
 
00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't um so I it's but from what you
 
00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:11.800 align:start position:0%
said it sounded like if someone was
 
00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:16.120 align:start position:0%
sexually assaulted and possibly drugged
 
00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:17.480 align:start position:0%
sexually assaulted I mean the
 
00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor sexual assault if they were
 
00:15:23.189 --> 00:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
grouped um that under the current
 
00:15:25.189 --> 00:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
attorney general rules that you would
 
00:15:27.829 --> 00:15:27.839 align:start position:0%
not um as long as they remembered that
 
00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
they were not pen ated you would not
 
00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:33.480 align:start position:0%
then that would not call for the kit to
 
00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
be used so this could be opened if the
 
00:15:38.069 --> 00:15:38.079 align:start position:0%
patient provided that
 
00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:41.240 align:start position:0%
history yes but if the patient provides
 
00:15:43.309 --> 00:15:43.319 align:start position:0%
a history of no nothing occurred no one
 
00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:45.560 align:start position:0%
could have gotten to me you know I've
 
00:15:48.069 --> 00:15:48.079 align:start position:0%
secured myself I was you know I hailed
 
00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:51.560 align:start position:0%
an Uber it wouldn't necess this wouldn't
 
00:15:54.269 --> 00:15:54.279 align:start position:0%
be warranted okay follow up yes follow
 
00:15:58.389 --> 00:15:58.399 align:start position:0%
up um okay so it I know that you just
 
00:16:01.189 --> 00:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
got to look at the um Amendment but it
 
00:16:03.629 --> 00:16:03.639 align:start position:0%
seems like the amendment is in line with
 
00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:07.240 align:start position:0%
that current practice where only if a
 
00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:09.720 align:start position:0%
MISD demean or sexual assault was
 
00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
experienced such as groping um
 
00:16:17.629 --> 00:16:17.639 align:start position:0%
and um the victim presented themselves
 
00:16:21.309 --> 00:16:21.319 align:start position:0%
at the hospital and reported such then
 
00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:23.000 align:start position:0%
the kit would be open so it sounds like
 
00:16:25.069 --> 00:16:25.079 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
00:16:30.389 --> 00:16:30.399 align:start position:0%
um that they articulate well would you
 
00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:33.480 align:start position:0%
agree I um I I think we would just
 
00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:35.000 align:start position:0%
definitely need some more time to look
 
00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
at this and look at the statute and make
 
00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
sure that we're not accidentally also
 
00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
excluding someone by listing specific
 
00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:43.240 align:start position:0%
parts of RSA
 
00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:46.120 align:start position:0%
632a um because I think the the term
 
00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
sexual assault Survivor was
 
00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
intentionally broad um but also to make
 
00:16:52.309 --> 00:16:52.319 align:start position:0%
sure that it was encompassing all of the
 
00:16:55.389 --> 00:16:55.399 align:start position:0%
crimes in partnership with the um RSA
 
00:16:59.030 --> 00:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
21m so the victims Bill of Rights um so
 
00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
I think this the spirit of this I think
 
00:17:03.389 --> 00:17:03.399 align:start position:0%
is is something that we agree with and
 
00:17:05.429 --> 00:17:05.439 align:start position:0%
we really appreciate the intent because
 
00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:07.480 align:start position:0%
absolutely everyone should know their
 
00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
rights and should be presented their
 
00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
rights um but I think just the technical
 
00:17:12.909 --> 00:17:12.919 align:start position:0%
component and making sure we're not
 
00:17:16.909 --> 00:17:16.919 align:start position:0%
missing something here representative
 
00:17:19.429 --> 00:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you so much and and thank
 
00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:21.400 align:start position:0%
you for your comments you you do
 
00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:22.720 align:start position:0%
understand we're under a significant
 
00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
time pressure because we are on Deadline
 
00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
uh does it make you um more or less
 
00:17:32.669 --> 00:17:32.679 align:start position:0%
reassured that the
 
00:17:37.909 --> 00:17:37.919 align:start position:0%
same um three statutes criminal statutes
 
00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
RSA 632 A2 632 A3 and 632 A4 which were
 
00:17:49.789 --> 00:17:49.799 align:start position:0%
in the amendment from last week which I
 
00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
believe you did have a chance to review
 
00:17:56.669 --> 00:17:56.679 align:start position:0%
are the same ones referred to here so
 
00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
there has been as far as I'm aware and
 
00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:01.880 align:start position:0%
and representative Lyon will correct me
 
00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:04.200 align:start position:0%
if I'm wrong about this they are the
 
00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
same statutes so they would cover uh the
 
00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:11.480 align:start position:0%
the same criminal offenses that we were
 
00:18:12.909 --> 00:18:12.919 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:18:12.919 --> 00:18:15.669 align:start position:0%
talking about
before

00:18:15.669 --> 00:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
and if so is it not true that what I'm
 
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
hearing is that they are closely aligned
 
00:18:26.789 --> 00:18:26.799 align:start position:0%
with what the situations that we're
 
00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:29.320 align:start position:0%
hearing that
 
00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:36.640 align:start position:0%
now yes in those situations that I
 
00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
provided absolutely that is what's
 
00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:40.480 align:start position:0%
provided now again it goes down to the
 
00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:41.960 align:start position:0%
patient history and what they're able to
 
00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
tell us that's what really guides
 
00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:47.080 align:start position:0%
whether or not one of these is utilized
 
00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:49.960 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you do you object to
 
00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
somebody who comes in and says that
 
00:18:54.909 --> 00:18:54.919 align:start position:0%
somebody tried to rape me um asking them
 
00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:56.720 align:start position:0%
if somebody groped them if they touched
 
00:18:58.870 --> 00:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
any of those intimate body parts
 
00:19:01.789 --> 00:19:01.799 align:start position:0%
um in a way that um in a way that wasn't
 
00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:04.120 align:start position:0%
consensual do you oppose you oppose the
 
00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
idea of of asking um if they met those
 
00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:08.440 align:start position:0%
conditions of a sexual assault when
 
00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
somebody says that somebody tried to
 
00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:10.710 align:start position:0%
somebody says that somebody tried to
rape

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:10.720 align:start position:0%
rape
 
00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
me that could be part of a history
 
00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:14.840 align:start position:0%
taking absolutely do you think it should
 
00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
be part of a history
 
00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:21.400 align:start position:0%
taking yes it would be okay thank you um
 
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
and then um uh representative
 
00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
Palmer I just have a a question that has
 
00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:29.960 align:start position:0%
been sort of bothering me in the in the
 
00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:33.200 align:start position:0%
that it seems like this the title of the
 
00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
bill or the how it's listed um and it
 
00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:39.720 align:start position:0%
says just end sentence from a patient
 
00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
who may have been drugged or sexually
 
00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
assaulted that we've somehow gotten a
 
00:19:47.149 --> 00:19:47.159 align:start position:0%
little hung up on the ore where I think
 
00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:49.480 align:start position:0%
the intent of this is not to not about
 
00:19:51.029 --> 00:19:51.039 align:start position:0%
the people who are drugged it's about
 
00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:52.760 align:start position:0%
people who are sexually assaulted and
 
00:19:55.029 --> 00:19:55.039 align:start position:0%
maybe they were drugged too and I just
 
00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:57.080 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that that we're not
 
00:19:59.390 --> 00:19:59.400 align:start position:0%
that that's not one of the
 
00:20:01.789 --> 00:20:01.799 align:start position:0%
um reasons that you're uncomfortable
 
00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:04.520 align:start position:0%
because I don't the act the the title
 
00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
here says that but the bill doesn't say
 
00:20:11.549 --> 00:20:11.559 align:start position:0%
that yes thank you um and then um
 
00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
finally I appreciate you coming here and
 
00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:15.440 align:start position:0%
giving us the feedback on the previous
 
00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
um Amendment um part of the reason we're
 
00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
meeting now sort of at the 11th hour is
 
00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:22.360 align:start position:0%
that the response from the Coalition was
 
00:20:24.669 --> 00:20:24.679 align:start position:0%
about a week later than we had asked for
 
00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:26.200 align:start position:0%
um we still took all the comments that
 
00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:28.240 align:start position:0%
you had and Incorporated them into this
 
00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
language we had some other bills that we
 
00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:31.880 align:start position:0%
were working with which is why we tried
 
00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
to get to the state sooner um but in
 
00:20:36.909 --> 00:20:36.919 align:start position:0%
good faith we incorporated all the
 
00:20:39.549 --> 00:20:39.559 align:start position:0%
feedback from the Coalition and perhap
 
00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:41.440 align:start position:0%
and in drafting it actually went further
 
00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
than we otherwise would have to to have
 
00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:45.200 align:start position:0%
a good faith work and so we're hoping
 
00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
that in good faith you will also work
 
00:20:48.909 --> 00:20:48.919 align:start position:0%
with us as we move forward on this bill
 
00:20:50.549 --> 00:20:50.559 align:start position:0%
with this amendment yeah no thank you so
 
00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
much and I think um we just wanted to
 
00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
make sure we reached out to all of the
 
00:20:55.950 --> 00:20:55.960 align:start position:0%
various Partners law enforcement
 
00:20:58.669 --> 00:20:58.679 align:start position:0%
prosecutors um members of um different
 
00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:01.320 align:start position:0%
medical facilities and uh folks in this
 
00:21:03.029 --> 00:21:03.039 align:start position:0%
work and just make sure that we got all
 
00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:05.000 align:start position:0%
of the feedback we absolutely could so
 
00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
we could be as well informed as possible
 
00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
so thank you for your patience and for
 
00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:10.360 align:start position:0%
incorporating our recommendations and
 
00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:11.720 align:start position:0%
we'd be happy to keep working with you
 
00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
on this um thank you and um and then I
 
00:21:16.149 --> 00:21:16.159 align:start position:0%
guess the final final thing to point out
 
00:21:17.789 --> 00:21:17.799 align:start position:0%
is that it does when it lists the
 
00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
statutes it then says including but not
 
00:21:22.669 --> 00:21:22.679 align:start position:0%
limited to so that it's not excluding
 
00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
anybody who does have a right to that
 
00:21:26.549 --> 00:21:26.559 align:start position:0%
all right thank you we'll take this back
 
00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:37.789 --> 00:21:37.799 align:start position:0%
okay representative not up them I have
 
00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
um a question um how long are the kits
 
00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
retained um and and I I'm sure that's
 
00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
under another statute but um um yes that
 
00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:50.120 align:start position:0%
there is another statute I believe
 
00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:51.480 align:start position:0%
there's a statute for that but I know
 
00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
that within the guidelines they have a
 
00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
whole part that's set out in that so if
 
00:21:57.430 --> 00:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
you think that that information would be
 
00:21:59.390 --> 00:21:59.400 align:start position:0%
something that's helpful to include for
 
00:22:00.789 --> 00:22:00.799 align:start position:0%
the survivors that's something we can
 
00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
make note of here um so that they can we
 
00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
can make sure that when they make this
 
00:22:07.269 --> 00:22:07.279 align:start position:0%
document through administrative rules we
 
00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:09.480 align:start position:0%
can do that and it'll also since it's
 
00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:11.320 align:start position:0%
just referencing and trying to get a
 
00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
summary of the existing rights that'll
 
00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
be the best place to make sure that we
 
00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:18.440 align:start position:0%
understand exactly what is stated um
 
00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:20.200 align:start position:0%
within that form and I think that that
 
00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
means that we don't need to try and
 
00:22:22.789 --> 00:22:22.799 align:start position:0%
figure that out now in this back and
 
00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:24.320 align:start position:0%
forth process between the House and
 
00:22:26.149 --> 00:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
Senate but go because it's pretty
 
00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
administrative to do it through
 
00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:29.440 align:start position:0%
administra rules okay thank you very
 
00:22:32.549 --> 00:22:32.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:32.559 --> 00:22:34.230 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:34.240 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:37.000 align:start position:0%
um I guess um I just wanted to find out
 
00:22:38.909 --> 00:22:38.919 align:start position:0%
if the amendment has gone to house
 
00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:40.840 align:start position:0%
committee services and or if we're still
 
00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:48.149 --> 00:22:48.159 align:start position:0%
it I would love that that way we can uh
 
00:22:49.549 --> 00:22:49.559 align:start position:0%
we can look at the actual one and just
 
00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
make sure we didn't miss a word thank
 
00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
Reed um and so as we wait for that I
 
00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
know the reason this process is so
 
00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:04.520 align:start position:0%
important is that it's the need to move
 
00:23:07.269 --> 00:23:07.279 align:start position:0%
from being a victim to being a Survivor
 
00:23:10.149 --> 00:23:10.159 align:start position:0%
and um I I think that this is one that
 
00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
we really tried to look at all of the
 
00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
language all the feedback that we had
 
00:23:17.029 --> 00:23:17.039 align:start position:0%
and really make sure that we got just to
 
00:23:19.149 --> 00:23:19.159 align:start position:0%
that me of the information to reference
 
00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:23.000 align:start position:0%
within itself here what is was already
 
00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
supposed to be
 
00:23:28.789 --> 00:23:28.799 align:start position:0%
provided so representative Weber
 
00:23:31.669 --> 00:23:31.679 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and I I just I I
 
00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:37.400 align:start position:0%
want to present my thinking on this um
 
00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
I'm very much in two minds uh uh I'm I'm
 
00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
definitely going to vote for the
 
00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:45.720 align:start position:0%
amendment because I think it um solves
 
00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
many issues that were there in the
 
00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
00:23:55.549 --> 00:23:55.559 align:start position:0%
um what I am still waffling about
 
00:24:00.789 --> 00:24:00.799 align:start position:0%
frankly is what I have heard from the
 
00:24:02.549 --> 00:24:02.559 align:start position:0%
people who are the
 
00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
practitioners is that what we have here
 
00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:07.720 align:start position:0%
is already being
 
00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
done and when what we have is already
 
00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
being done my inclination is not to mess
 
00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:16.789 align:start position:0%
being done my inclination is not to mess
with

00:24:16.789 --> 00:24:16.799 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:24:16.799 --> 00:24:18.590 align:start position:0%
with
it

00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:22.600 align:start position:0%
um so I'm not at all sure once having
 
00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
voted for the amendment whether I'm
 
00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
going to vote for the underlying bill or
 
00:24:29.789 --> 00:24:29.799 align:start position:0%
not um I I sincerely appreciate all the
 
00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:31.480 align:start position:0%
work that's been
 
00:24:36.549 --> 00:24:36.559 align:start position:0%
done to date and I may change my mind
 
00:24:39.789 --> 00:24:39.799 align:start position:0%
again sometime between now and when we
 
00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
have to vote on it as a full house so I
 
00:24:43.789 --> 00:24:43.799 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that everybody
 
00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:44.840 align:start position:0%
knows that
 
00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:48.200 align:start position:0%
I'm uh whatever happens today I'm not
 
00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
particularly solid on it but I do think
 
00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
that we've come along way in terms of
 
00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
articulating and understanding what
 
00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:58.389 align:start position:0%
articulating and understanding what
happens

00:24:58.389 --> 00:24:58.399 align:start position:0%
happens
 
00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
and again I think that everybody is very
 
00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
very um concerned about
 
00:25:09.789 --> 00:25:09.799 align:start position:0%
turning victims into survivors and
 
00:25:12.149 --> 00:25:12.159 align:start position:0%
giving them back their power over their
 
00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
bodies and their lives
 
00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to I think we're all as
 
00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
one on that the problem is how we get
 
00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:22.520 align:start position:0%
there thank you um the reason why this
 
00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:24.760 align:start position:0%
bill came forward in the first place was
 
00:25:27.789 --> 00:25:27.799 align:start position:0%
there was a Survivor who knew the laws
 
00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
knew the statutes but still were not
 
00:25:32.029 --> 00:25:32.039 align:start position:0%
provided with the kit in their time of
 
00:25:34.549 --> 00:25:34.559 align:start position:0%
need um I I know that there's other
 
00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:37.200 align:start position:0%
times when when we recognize that even
 
00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
if it's just a few people who are having
 
00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:40.760 align:start position:0%
a challenge um it's something that we
 
00:25:43.389 --> 00:25:43.399 align:start position:0%
need to recognize um the biggest part
 
00:25:46.549 --> 00:25:46.559 align:start position:0%
here is that this summary form would be
 
00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:49.000 align:start position:0%
available to the doctors so that instead
 
00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:51.480 align:start position:0%
of so that if they're not the ones who
 
00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
are giving the the the test um they need
 
00:25:57.190 --> 00:25:57.200 align:start position:0%
to know some amount of information but
 
00:25:59.870 --> 00:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
when you put put 115 page for I'll ask
 
00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:01.320 align:start position:0%
the doctors on the committee but if you
 
00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
put a 115 page document of something
 
00:26:05.389 --> 00:26:05.399 align:start position:0%
that you need to know enough to refer
 
00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:07.720 align:start position:0%
but not enough to do the actual
 
00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
procedure would it be beneficial to have
 
00:26:12.909 --> 00:26:12.919 align:start position:0%
a summary document prepared by the same
 
00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
people that that per that um that
 
00:26:18.389 --> 00:26:18.399 align:start position:0%
created the larger document giving you
 
00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:21.240 align:start position:0%
that information as a Frontline Doctor
 
00:26:23.389 --> 00:26:23.399 align:start position:0%
Who first Encounters this patient to
 
00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
know whether you should refer on or
 
00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:27.880 align:start position:0%
whether it's not a case to refer is that
 
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
a helpful thing to the doctors on the
 
00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:34.840 align:start position:0%
committee well since you're asking so
 
00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
just looking back to when I did work in
 
00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:39.320 align:start position:0%
the ER and this this was actually
 
00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
something that came across the the ER
 
00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
well both ER that that um had protocols
 
00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:50.320 align:start position:0%
and so um I really and and to be honest
 
00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
they had nurses who knew better than I
 
00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
did so I it would be you
 
00:26:58.430 --> 00:26:58.440 align:start position:0%
know certainly it would it would be
 
00:26:59.830 --> 00:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
helpful to have something that you could
 
00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
look at but most of the
 
00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
time there was the you know sort of the
 
00:27:06.669 --> 00:27:06.679 align:start position:0%
hospital protocol that was there the
 
00:27:10.029 --> 00:27:10.039 align:start position:0%
same nurse would you know take over and
 
00:27:11.909 --> 00:27:11.919 align:start position:0%
then I would be left to just doing any
 
00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
medical things that came up that were
 
00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:17.440 align:start position:0%
beyond the the um the whole assault kit
 
00:27:19.909 --> 00:27:19.919 align:start position:0%
so I guess sort of the answer is I'm I'm
 
00:27:21.549 --> 00:27:21.559 align:start position:0%
not sure how much difference it would
 
00:27:23.909 --> 00:27:23.919 align:start position:0%
make to the actual practice of me doing
 
00:27:26.389 --> 00:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
that having said that I was not an ER
 
00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:28.520 align:start position:0%
trained physician it was just small
 
00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
hospitals you you do what you have to do
 
00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:33.440 align:start position:0%
so they probably have more training than
 
00:27:35.909 --> 00:27:35.919 align:start position:0%
I did in that particular
 
00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:46.190 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:46.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
okay I I I just oh I'm gonna keep going
 
00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:50.320 align:start position:0%
just because we're waiting for the
 
00:27:52.990 --> 00:27:53.000 align:start position:0%
document to come down um I I just think
 
00:27:54.789 --> 00:27:54.799 align:start position:0%
that uh being able to have a summary
 
00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:56.480 align:start position:0%
there's so much information in front of
 
00:27:58.310 --> 00:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
all our providers in front of our First
 
00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:00.320 align:start position:0%
Responders and in front of everybody
 
00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:01.960 align:start position:0%
that being able to consolidate it to
 
00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:03.960 align:start position:0%
something where you know a friend could
 
00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:07.640 align:start position:0%
say you know you know Jane um yes I
 
00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
support you this is something you should
 
00:28:12.029 --> 00:28:12.039 align:start position:0%
go ahead and report this because this is
 
00:28:15.669 --> 00:28:15.679 align:start position:0%
you know they this is illegal this does
 
00:28:18.269 --> 00:28:18.279 align:start position:0%
qualify you for this test kit and I
 
00:28:20.909 --> 00:28:20.919 align:start position:0%
recognize that there's a lot that is not
 
00:28:23.230 --> 00:28:23.240 align:start position:0%
actually prosecuted um we killed a
 
00:28:25.789 --> 00:28:25.799 align:start position:0%
couple trees giving you this the reality
 
00:28:27.669 --> 00:28:27.679 align:start position:0%
of sexual assault in New Hampshire it
 
00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:31.880 align:start position:0%
was a 2006 document in this it actually
 
00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
speaks about some of those
 
00:28:34.909 --> 00:28:34.919 align:start position:0%
misperceptions some of the hurdles to
 
00:28:38.029 --> 00:28:38.039 align:start position:0%
reporting and by knowing what's going to
 
00:28:39.789 --> 00:28:39.799 align:start position:0%
happen if you go in and knowing if you
 
00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:42.200 align:start position:0%
qualify for one of these kits that that
 
00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:44.120 align:start position:0%
takes away some of that con I believe
 
00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:46.120 align:start position:0%
that that would take away some concern I
 
00:28:47.549 --> 00:28:47.559 align:start position:0%
know that when this happened to me I
 
00:28:49.029 --> 00:28:49.039 align:start position:0%
didn't think anybody would believe me or
 
00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
anybody would do anything about it so I
 
00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:53.640 align:start position:0%
didn't tell anybody for years but had I
 
00:28:55.509 --> 00:28:55.519 align:start position:0%
known and had I known what my rights
 
00:28:57.710 --> 00:28:57.720 align:start position:0%
were then it might not have you know
 
00:28:59.389 --> 00:28:59.399 align:start position:0%
ended up uh with me treating it with a
 
00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:02.480 align:start position:0%
couple extra tubs of uh of uh fudge
 
00:29:04.789 --> 00:29:04.799 align:start position:0%
swirl ice cream that maybe I could have
 
00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
dealt with it in the moment and uh
 
00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:08.600 align:start position:0%
looking back to myself at that time of
 
00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:10.720 align:start position:0%
life I really would have liked to know
 
00:29:13.029 --> 00:29:13.039 align:start position:0%
what qualified and and if they would
 
00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:14.600 align:start position:0%
have even listen to me at the emergency
 
00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:16.720 align:start position:0%
room because I didn't even get to that
 
00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:18.200 align:start position:0%
point because I didn't think that
 
00:29:21.269 --> 00:29:21.279 align:start position:0%
anybody would listen or believe me and
 
00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
know it's it's one of those issues too
 
00:29:24.669 --> 00:29:24.679 align:start position:0%
we it's so
 
00:29:27.389 --> 00:29:27.399 align:start position:0%
widespread it's so widespread that if we
 
00:29:29.149 --> 00:29:29.159 align:start position:0%
can make sure that instead of dealing
 
00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
with the consequences years and years
 
00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
after you know I don't know how much of
 
00:29:35.909 --> 00:29:35.919 align:start position:0%
um of alcoholism in women is just trying
 
00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:38.200 align:start position:0%
to deal with this I know that you know I
 
00:29:40.149 --> 00:29:40.159 align:start position:0%
didn't just treat it with a fudge soral
 
00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
ice cream sometimes I treat it with the
 
00:29:44.509 --> 00:29:44.519 align:start position:0%
martini too so um I just want to try and
 
00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:46.200 align:start position:0%
get ahead of this and protect the people
 
00:29:48.389 --> 00:29:48.399 align:start position:0%
that it's happening to now because for
 
00:29:49.789 --> 00:29:49.799 align:start position:0%
those of us that it happened to in the
 
00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
past you know that's water under the
 
00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
bridge but what we need to do is look
 
00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
forward and support people going forward
 
00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
so that's why I've worked on this and I
 
00:29:58.509 --> 00:29:58.519 align:start position:0%
think that even if it is a little bit
 
00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:01.240 align:start position:0%
more work um I know representative Lynn
 
00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:02.840 align:start position:0%
and I deal with lots and lots of
 
00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:04.120 align:start position:0%
administrative rules that come through
 
00:30:07.909 --> 00:30:07.919 align:start position:0%
Jael car um but it's it's
 
00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:11.000 align:start position:0%
important representative Weber I just
 
00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:20.440 align:start position:0%
um we have all learned a lot since
 
00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:22.840 align:start position:0%
2006 and I think there's been a huge
 
00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
Evolution since this report was written
 
00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:29.200 align:start position:0%
um I hope we will will continue to
 
00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
evolve and one of the things that I
 
00:30:35.389 --> 00:30:35.399 align:start position:0%
think is helpful in the the most in the
 
00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:38.240 align:start position:0%
latest iteration of this is that it
 
00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:41.240 align:start position:0%
allows for continued Evolution which was
 
00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
not the case
 
00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:45.480 align:start position:0%
before um and and it does so within the
 
00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
rule ranking process which in itself is
 
00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:53.320 align:start position:0%
glacial uh but um that that I think is
 
00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:55.880 align:start position:0%
helpful but I I do want to acknowledge
 
00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:01.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:08.029 --> 00:31:08.039 align:start position:0%
that we sometimes make laws that deal
 
00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:11.200 align:start position:0%
with a situation that happened at some
 
00:31:15.149 --> 00:31:15.159 align:start position:0%
point in the past and thank goodness we
 
00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
have evolved past that point
 
00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:23.320 align:start position:0%
already um in which case it's not always
 
00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:28.760 align:start position:0%
necessary to make a law about it um
 
00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:30.360 align:start position:0%
but that having been
 
00:31:34.629 --> 00:31:34.639 align:start position:0%
said evolution is really important
 
00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:37.720 align:start position:0%
so I recognize that I've evolved I'm
 
00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
married so I'm not out in dating
 
00:31:44.549 --> 00:31:44.559 align:start position:0%
situations I carry so I'm in less apt to
 
00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:47.360 align:start position:0%
um sort of surprise situations but there
 
00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
are a lot of people that haven't gone
 
00:31:51.269 --> 00:31:51.279 align:start position:0%
through that process and are now in that
 
00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:53.440 align:start position:0%
you know in that first emerging
 
00:31:55.549 --> 00:31:55.559 align:start position:0%
butterfly stage and even though we may
 
00:31:57.870 --> 00:31:57.880 align:start position:0%
have evolved past it unfortunately the
 
00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:00.440 align:start position:0%
society hasn't evolved past sexual
 
00:32:04.629 --> 00:32:04.639 align:start position:0%
assault I I look forward to that day I'm
 
00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
not sure it'll happen but I look forward
 
00:32:08.549 --> 00:32:08.559 align:start position:0%
I was talking about treatment options
 
00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:18.200 align:start position:0%
things um we actually are at um I don't
 
00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:20.600 align:start position:0%
know if it would make sense for us to
 
00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
recess this work session so that we can
 
00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
begin the hearing on the non gerain
 
00:32:29.149 --> 00:32:29.159 align:start position:0%
Amendment um because it's now 10:30 so
 
00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:31.960 align:start position:0%
we're eligible to do that um and then
 
00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:34.200 align:start position:0%
once we have this when we have an
 
00:32:37.149 --> 00:32:37.159 align:start position:0%
appropriate time then we can um recess
 
00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
what we're doing in order to come back
 
00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:41.320 align:start position:0%
to the work session we I believe we have
 
00:32:43.549 --> 00:32:43.559 align:start position:0%
to recess to a Time certain but you go
 
00:32:45.389 --> 00:32:45.399 align:start position:0%
check with the clerk okay and now we
 
00:32:47.029 --> 00:32:47.039 align:start position:0%
have the amendment but if we have an
 
00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
amendment and a number I think we're
 
00:32:52.110 --> 00:32:52.120 align:start position:0%
good to go perfect
 
00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:55.880 align:start position:0%
yes um that was um the Coalition against
 
00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:17.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
thank you and as I pass this down I will
 
00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
move Amendment uh 2023 2448 H to House
 
00:33:29.830 --> 00:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
Bill 37 8 is there a second a second
 
00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:36.190 align:start position:0%
Bill 37 8 is there a second a second
thank

00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:36.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:39.070 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:39.080 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:33:42.269 --> 00:33:42.279 align:start position:0%
okay um and as we were drafting it um it
 
00:33:44.669 --> 00:33:44.679 align:start position:0%
retained the language just that reflects
 
00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:47.080 align:start position:0%
what is the existing right um it's on
 
00:33:50.029 --> 00:33:50.039 align:start position:0%
page on lines 12 through 14 there is the
 
00:33:51.629 --> 00:33:51.639 align:start position:0%
existing right that you can refuse
 
00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
elements of the test kit um and so I had
 
00:33:57.070 --> 00:33:57.080 align:start position:0%
tried to remove that language because it
 
00:33:58.629 --> 00:33:58.639 align:start position:0%
was one of those concerns of the
 
00:34:00.669 --> 00:34:00.679 align:start position:0%
Coalition that's one where I felt like
 
00:34:02.029 --> 00:34:02.039 align:start position:0%
we were going a little further than we
 
00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
needed since it was an existing right um
 
00:34:05.470 --> 00:34:05.480 align:start position:0%
but that actually got retained in
 
00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:08.240 align:start position:0%
drafting so it would include the right
 
00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:10.520 align:start position:0%
not to be prevented from or charged for
 
00:34:12.109 --> 00:34:12.119 align:start position:0%
receiving a medical examination
 
00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:13.720 align:start position:0%
including any individual element or
 
00:34:16.109 --> 00:34:16.119 align:start position:0%
elements of the kit which is already
 
00:34:17.790 --> 00:34:17.800 align:start position:0%
allowed because you can you can refuse
 
00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:20.990 align:start position:0%
allowed because you can you can refuse
any

00:34:20.990 --> 00:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:23.109 --> 00:34:23.119 align:start position:0%
section perfect and it looks like we
 
00:34:25.069 --> 00:34:25.079 align:start position:0%
have I believe we have what we have need
 
00:34:29.149 --> 00:34:29.159 align:start position:0%
here so with that um I will pull up our
 
00:34:31.589 --> 00:34:31.599 align:start position:0%
list of who is here and then call the
 
00:34:33.589 --> 00:34:33.599 align:start position:0%

00:34:35.869 --> 00:34:35.879 align:start position:0%

Cen
 
00:38:30.109 --> 00:38:30.119 align:start position:0%
I come before the committee to introduce
 
00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
an amendment to House Bill
 
00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
580 and basically there was in original
 
00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:41.400 align:start position:0%
Bill an addition to RSA
 
00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:43.640 align:start position:0%
232 which was
 
00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
32A and in speaking with the clerk and
 
00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:48.349 align:start position:0%
32A and in speaking with the clerk and
the

00:38:48.349 --> 00:38:48.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:50.720 align:start position:0%
speaker what they said was because we're
 
00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:54.200 align:start position:0%
changing the fundamental part of 32
 
00:38:57.069 --> 00:38:57.079 align:start position:0%
which was the strike the ground grounds
 
00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
for which a person could um object to it
 
00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
a parent or Guardian which was not part
 
00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:05.240 align:start position:0%
of the original bill that would trigger
 
00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
the non- gerain hearing which we're
 
00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
having today so I bring before the
 
00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:13.160 align:start position:0%
committee this amendment which was to
 
00:39:15.349 --> 00:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
allow for vision
 
00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:17.720 align:start position:0%
screening which was part of the physical
 
00:39:22.349 --> 00:39:22.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:27.109 --> 00:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
232 at the same time to broaden
 
00:39:29.349 --> 00:39:29.359 align:start position:0%
the ability for a parent or Guardian to
 
00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
object to the physical exam which would
 
00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
include div vision
 
00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:35.480 align:start position:0%
screening so that's the reason for the
 
00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
amendment to you folks today um it's if
 
00:39:40.589 --> 00:39:40.599 align:start position:0%
you go back and look at the original
 
00:39:43.589 --> 00:39:43.599 align:start position:0%
bill it's really truncated it
 
00:39:48.069 --> 00:39:48.079 align:start position:0%
immensely um to a very small change in
 
00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
the RSA underlying the physical
 
00:39:54.589 --> 00:39:54.599 align:start position:0%
examination for a child um just a little
 
00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
bit of a side note during the the
 
00:39:58.790 --> 00:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
hearing on the subcommittee I was kind
 
00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:00.640 align:start position:0%
of confused because I took the word
 
00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:02.200 align:start position:0%
pupil to mean
 
00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:05.240 align:start position:0%
student I sorry for I exam and not the
 
00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
student themselves so we got off a
 
00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
little bit of a tangent but that's not
 
00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:11.800 align:start position:0%
the case
 
00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
today thank you are there any
 
00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:16.760 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee thank you
 
00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:18.520 align:start position:0%
very much representative I'll bring up a
 
00:40:22.069 --> 00:40:22.079 align:start position:0%
pink card thank you um and uh Curtis
 
00:40:25.349 --> 00:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:25.359 --> 00:40:33.470 align:start position:0%
 
speak

00:40:33.470 --> 00:40:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:35.190 --> 00:40:35.200 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair good morning
 
00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:39.240 align:start position:0%
Curtis Barry I I'm here this morning on
 
00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
behalf of the New Hampshire Optometric
 
00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:44.280 align:start position:0%
Association which represents roughly 180
 
00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
Doctors of Optometry here in the state
 
00:40:50.910 --> 00:40:50.920 align:start position:0%
um I did not check off support or uh
 
00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
oppose on the pink card primarily
 
00:40:56.349 --> 00:40:56.359 align:start position:0%
because it's awful hard to oppose a
 
00:40:57.829 --> 00:40:57.839 align:start position:0%
concept where we're encouraging more
 
00:41:00.910 --> 00:41:00.920 align:start position:0%
Vision screenings for students um on the
 
00:41:04.069 --> 00:41:04.079 align:start position:0%
other hand having discussions with both
 
00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:05.640 align:start position:0%
members of the
 
00:41:09.109 --> 00:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
association um representative Merchant
 
00:41:11.109 --> 00:41:11.119 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure on behalf of the
 
00:41:13.150 --> 00:41:13.160 align:start position:0%
association what this particular
 
00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
Amendment accomplishes uh you may recall
 
00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
the public hearing which was many months
 
00:41:20.069 --> 00:41:20.079 align:start position:0%
ago uh the association opposed the bill
 
00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
as introduced for a variety of reasons
 
00:41:24.309 --> 00:41:24.319 align:start position:0%
which don't need to go into um and I
 
00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:26.480 align:start position:0%
know that the subcommittee made some
 
00:41:30.349 --> 00:41:30.359 align:start position:0%
efforts to um send the bill in a
 
00:41:33.309 --> 00:41:33.319 align:start position:0%
direction of encouraging a comprehensive
 
00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
eye examination which is what the
 
00:41:37.710 --> 00:41:37.720 align:start position:0%
association is all about a vision
 
00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:41.880 align:start position:0%
screening has its place uh but it can
 
00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
it's not Diagnostic in nature it
 
00:41:47.309 --> 00:41:47.319 align:start position:0%
captures a fraction of vision or ey
 
00:41:49.109 --> 00:41:49.119 align:start position:0%
health problems that a vision screening
 
00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:51.560 align:start position:0%
will and a vision screening if there is
 
00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
a problem identified you would need to
 
00:41:56.750 --> 00:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
refer that student to
 
00:41:59.069 --> 00:41:59.079 align:start position:0%
a comprehensive eye exam anyway or to
 
00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:02.280 align:start position:0%
get a prescription um not sure what the
 
00:42:04.990 --> 00:42:05.000 align:start position:0%
benefit of this particular amendment is
 
00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:06.520 align:start position:0%
um I've committed to representative
 
00:42:08.589 --> 00:42:08.599 align:start position:0%
Merchant if the committee so desires to
 
00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
send the built inum study I've committed
 
00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
that the Optometric Association would
 
00:42:15.309 --> 00:42:15.319 align:start position:0%
provide resources both from our end and
 
00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
the American Optometric Association
 
00:42:18.670 --> 00:42:18.680 align:start position:0%
which is vastly more than than we have
 
00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:20.720 align:start position:0%
including a lot of studies and a lot of
 
00:42:23.109 --> 00:42:23.119 align:start position:0%
ideas so I'm happy to answer questions
 
00:42:25.349 --> 00:42:25.359 align:start position:0%
Madam chair just please keep in mind I'm
 
00:42:27.549 --> 00:42:27.559 align:start position:0%
not a doctor
 
00:42:28.910 --> 00:42:28.920 align:start position:0%
thank you and I appreciate you being
 
00:42:30.430 --> 00:42:30.440 align:start position:0%
here today are there any questions from
 
00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:31.150 align:start position:0%
here today are there any questions from
the

00:42:31.150 --> 00:42:31.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:42:33.390 --> 00:42:33.400 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
kushman thank you madam chair and thank
 
00:42:38.549 --> 00:42:38.559 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question certainly um
 
00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
so I would you agree that there's at
 
00:42:44.349 --> 00:42:44.359 align:start position:0%
least some benefit of um the encouraging
 
00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
language for a screening that then could
 
00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
trigger the referrals and that would
 
00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:50.480 align:start position:0%
increase the exams especially ones that
 
00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:54.040 align:start position:0%
are needed and not you know screening
 
00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
every or doing an exam on every child
 
00:43:00.430 --> 00:43:00.440 align:start position:0%
when not be necessary thank you um yes
 
00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
and no again there's there's benefit to
 
00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
encouraging parents to have their
 
00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
students or their children's eyes
 
00:43:11.950 --> 00:43:11.960 align:start position:0%
checked certainly um in our opinion
 
00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
though given the fact that unless I'm
 
00:43:18.030 --> 00:43:18.040 align:start position:0%
missing something vision screening is
 
00:43:19.870 --> 00:43:19.880 align:start position:0%
already part
 
00:43:22.630 --> 00:43:22.640 align:start position:0%
of the the physical exam that the
 
00:43:24.349 --> 00:43:24.359 align:start position:0%
child's going to go through and that
 
00:43:26.829 --> 00:43:26.839 align:start position:0%
there are numerous school districts
 
00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
where um optometrists opthalmologists in
 
00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
conjunction with Lions Club provide
 
00:43:33.790 --> 00:43:33.800 align:start position:0%
vision screenings
 
00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:43.109 --> 00:43:43.119 align:start position:0%
as providing a false sense of security
 
00:43:45.670 --> 00:43:45.680 align:start position:0%
in that oh the school district requires
 
00:43:47.950 --> 00:43:47.960 align:start position:0%
my vision screening they're asking to to
 
00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:50.720 align:start position:0%
ensure that I did get a vision screening
 
00:43:53.910 --> 00:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
my kids's eyes are probably Al okay when
 
00:43:56.109 --> 00:43:56.119 align:start position:0%
in fact the vision screening can Miss A
 
00:43:58.750 --> 00:43:58.760 align:start position:0%
whole host of other conditions that
 
00:44:02.109 --> 00:44:02.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:04.720 align:start position:0%
capture thank you for the
 
00:44:06.670 --> 00:44:06.680 align:start position:0%
question thank you are there other
 
00:44:09.589 --> 00:44:09.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:12.109 --> 00:44:12.119 align:start position:0%

today so with that uh let's get onto the
 
00:50:59.190 --> 00:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
business of the of the day uh first bill
 
00:51:02.109 --> 00:51:02.119 align:start position:0%
for us to consider is a house bill
 
00:51:04.630 --> 00:51:04.640 align:start position:0%
264 and representative land do you have
 
00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:07.549 align:start position:0%
264 and representative land do you have
a

00:51:07.549 --> 00:51:07.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
motion um yes I would move
 
00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
itl okay representative uh Seth King I'd
 
00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
like to second that motion okay would
 
00:51:18.349 --> 00:51:18.359 align:start position:0%
you like to speak to your motion
 
00:51:20.549 --> 00:51:20.559 align:start position:0%
representative Lon um yes thank you Mr
 
00:51:24.390 --> 00:51:24.400 align:start position:0%
chairman um the this bill is about
 
00:51:26.470 --> 00:51:26.480 align:start position:0%
changing your birth certificate to
 
00:51:30.549 --> 00:51:30.559 align:start position:0%
reflect um current current things um I
 
00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:32.640 align:start position:0%
truly believe that a birth certificate
 
00:51:34.670 --> 00:51:34.680 align:start position:0%
is a record of your conditions at Birth
 
00:51:36.789 --> 00:51:36.799 align:start position:0%
and we have many many other documents
 
00:51:38.430 --> 00:51:38.440 align:start position:0%
which are better suited to proving
 
00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
identity today it's a matter more of
 
00:51:43.589 --> 00:51:43.599 align:start position:0%
proving your identity and having these
 
00:51:45.309 --> 00:51:45.319 align:start position:0%
other documents as opposed to carrying
 
00:51:48.510 --> 00:51:48.520 align:start position:0%
around a birth certificate as your proof
 
00:51:52.390 --> 00:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
of who you are um in in the current day
 
00:51:56.109 --> 00:51:56.119 align:start position:0%
um as far as as far as um
 
00:51:57.670 --> 00:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
as far as current use of birth
 
00:51:59.549 --> 00:51:59.559 align:start position:0%
certificates I believe that it is
 
00:52:01.150 --> 00:52:01.160 align:start position:0%
absolutely critical for being able to
 
00:52:02.950 --> 00:52:02.960 align:start position:0%
prove that you were born here and you're
 
00:52:05.589 --> 00:52:05.599 align:start position:0%
a citizen for purposes like voting but
 
00:52:07.950 --> 00:52:07.960 align:start position:0%
beyond that um we're pretty much trying
 
00:52:10.870 --> 00:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
to use a document that trying to use a
 
00:52:13.309 --> 00:52:13.319 align:start position:0%
document for more than it was originally
 
00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
intended and therefore while I
 
00:52:18.150 --> 00:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
appreciate I I appreciate the the
 
00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
desires of the community I want to move
 
00:52:21.950 --> 00:52:21.960 align:start position:0%
away from using birth certificates as a
 
00:52:23.910 --> 00:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
current form of identity for anything
 
00:52:26.670 --> 00:52:26.680 align:start position:0%
other than citizens ship and that's why
 
00:52:28.750 --> 00:52:28.760 align:start position:0%
I moved um as
 
00:52:32.109 --> 00:52:32.119 align:start position:0%
itl okay again we're discussing HB 264
 
00:52:34.950 --> 00:52:34.960 align:start position:0%
the Motions itl representative Canon not
 
00:52:37.030 --> 00:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
to put you on the spot but I I suspect
 
00:52:38.470 --> 00:52:38.480 align:start position:0%
you might have some strong feelings
 
00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:40.270 align:start position:0%
you might have some strong feelings
about

00:52:40.270 --> 00:52:40.280 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:52:43.230 --> 00:52:43.240 align:start position:0%
this well I appreciate representative
 
00:52:47.270 --> 00:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
Leon's U position currently the
 
00:52:49.109 --> 00:52:49.119 align:start position:0%
documents that we're using a birth
 
00:52:51.589 --> 00:52:51.599 align:start position:0%
certificate driver's license and
 
00:52:54.030 --> 00:52:54.040 align:start position:0%
passports there are no additional
 
00:52:55.829 --> 00:52:55.839 align:start position:0%
options in the US
 
00:52:59.470 --> 00:52:59.480 align:start position:0%
or in other countries so uh I proposed
 
00:53:02.670 --> 00:53:02.680 align:start position:0%
this bill um to provide a change for
 
00:53:05.789 --> 00:53:05.799 align:start position:0%
those individuals who want to be
 
00:53:08.309 --> 00:53:08.319 align:start position:0%
documented correctly on their birth
 
00:53:11.630 --> 00:53:11.640 align:start position:0%
certificate um which we already do this
 
00:53:14.910 --> 00:53:14.920 align:start position:0%
just simplifies the process otherwise uh
 
00:53:16.670 --> 00:53:16.680 align:start position:0%
an individual wishing to change their
 
00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
information would have to incur the cost
 
00:53:21.430 --> 00:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
of going to court and getting a Justice
 
00:53:26.589 --> 00:53:26.599 align:start position:0%
to make the decision um with it and
 
00:53:28.549 --> 00:53:28.559 align:start position:0%
still requiring the same information
 
00:53:30.589 --> 00:53:30.599 align:start position:0%
that's proposed in this is a statement
 
00:53:33.630 --> 00:53:33.640 align:start position:0%
from the doctor uh indicating that this
 
00:53:36.150 --> 00:53:36.160 align:start position:0%
individual will be living their life as
 
00:53:39.349 --> 00:53:39.359 align:start position:0%
the gender they identify as so it's a
 
00:53:44.069 --> 00:53:44.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:46.829 --> 00:53:46.839 align:start position:0%
um not require them to go to court to
 
00:53:51.390 --> 00:53:51.400 align:start position:0%
get a Jud judicial decision uh but if
 
00:53:53.589 --> 00:53:53.599 align:start position:0%
they want to change it at a future date
 
00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
it would require the same process that
 
00:53:56.829 --> 00:53:56.839 align:start position:0%
we currently
 
00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
have thank you other
 
00:54:03.990 --> 00:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Weber I just
 
00:54:06.510 --> 00:54:06.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to point out that I think was
 
00:54:08.109 --> 00:54:08.119 align:start position:0%
sort of understood in what
 
00:54:10.589 --> 00:54:10.599 align:start position:0%
representative Canon said we do change
 
00:54:13.030 --> 00:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
birth certificates for children who are
 
00:54:16.349 --> 00:54:16.359 align:start position:0%
adopted uh to conform those to the
 
00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
realities of their life and we do that
 
00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
without having to think about a whole
 
00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
different kind of document I don't think
 
00:54:27.789 --> 00:54:27.799 align:start position:0%
that this is a huge departure from what
 
00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
we're already doing I think it's an
 
00:54:31.990 --> 00:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
affirming step that I am very much in
 
00:54:34.750 --> 00:54:34.760 align:start position:0%
favor of thank you so I will be opposing
 
00:54:38.870 --> 00:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh itl and hoping for not to pass motion
 
00:54:41.789 --> 00:54:41.799 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh Merchant
 
00:54:43.750 --> 00:54:43.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
00:54:46.630 --> 00:54:46.640 align:start position:0%
chair this basically does not change the
 
00:54:48.950 --> 00:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
outcome all is doing is talking about
 
00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:49.990 align:start position:0%
outcome all is doing is talking about
the

00:54:49.990 --> 00:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:54:53.470 --> 00:54:53.480 align:start position:0%
process basically if someone goes to the
 
00:54:55.470 --> 00:54:55.480 align:start position:0%
court today they can change the birth
 
00:54:55.480 --> 00:54:56.750 align:start position:0%
court today they can change the birth
certificate

00:54:56.750 --> 00:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
certificate
 
00:54:59.670 --> 00:54:59.680 align:start position:0%
accordingly that's the end result all
 
00:55:01.589 --> 00:55:01.599 align:start position:0%
this is doing is changing the journey on
 
00:55:04.470 --> 00:55:04.480 align:start position:0%
which one goes to get there and making
 
00:55:08.710 --> 00:55:08.720 align:start position:0%
it more simplistic and easier to obtain
 
00:55:11.710 --> 00:55:11.720 align:start position:0%
than what we have today so I want to go
 
00:55:14.190 --> 00:55:14.200 align:start position:0%
back to the outcome doesn't change it's
 
00:55:15.990 --> 00:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
only the process the path we choose to
 
00:55:19.349 --> 00:55:19.359 align:start position:0%
get there thank you representative Lon
 
00:55:21.510 --> 00:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman um I had a
 
00:55:23.150 --> 00:55:23.160 align:start position:0%
question for representative Weber when a
 
00:55:25.309 --> 00:55:25.319 align:start position:0%
child is adopted does that mean that the
 
00:55:27.029 --> 00:55:27.039 align:start position:0%
parent on the birth certificate is
 
00:55:28.990 --> 00:55:29.000 align:start position:0%
changed I'm curious how adoption would
 
00:55:31.589 --> 00:55:31.599 align:start position:0%
change the birth
 
00:55:35.069 --> 00:55:35.079 align:start position:0%
certificate I believe that a new perhaps
 
00:55:35.079 --> 00:55:36.670 align:start position:0%
certificate I believe that a new perhaps
um

00:55:36.670 --> 00:55:36.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:40.190 --> 00:55:40.200 align:start position:0%
representative um oh please help me ly
 
00:55:43.950 --> 00:55:43.960 align:start position:0%
Lynn might have more insight but I
 
00:55:46.430 --> 00:55:46.440 align:start position:0%
believe that an entirely new document is
 
00:55:49.829 --> 00:55:49.839 align:start position:0%
issued because uh the child has been
 
00:55:52.190 --> 00:55:52.200 align:start position:0%
adopted they have new parents they have
 
00:55:55.230 --> 00:55:55.240 align:start position:0%
a new name and we make those those
 
00:55:57.589 --> 00:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
changes on an amended birth
 
00:55:59.990 --> 00:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
certificate I I don't know the answer to
 
00:56:01.630 --> 00:56:01.640 align:start position:0%
that question sorry to have put you on
 
00:56:04.230 --> 00:56:04.240 align:start position:0%
the spot and I'm really sorry about my
 
00:56:06.349 --> 00:56:06.359 align:start position:0%
inability to remember names for which I
 
00:56:08.029 --> 00:56:08.039 align:start position:0%
apologize to every two attorneys here
 
00:56:09.630 --> 00:56:09.640 align:start position:0%
and neither can answer a legal question
 
00:56:14.109 --> 00:56:14.119 align:start position:0%
this is not good not in this state your
 
00:56:16.990 --> 00:56:17.000 align:start position:0%
honor my experience is also from out of
 
00:56:19.309 --> 00:56:19.319 align:start position:0%
the state but it it is my understanding
 
00:56:20.750 --> 00:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
that they do change the birth
 
00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
certificates for in adoption
 
00:56:27.349 --> 00:56:27.359 align:start position:0%
proceedings presed L on I had no
 
00:56:27.359 --> 00:56:29.510 align:start position:0%
proceedings presed L on I had no
idea

00:56:29.510 --> 00:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
idea
 
00:56:33.430 --> 00:56:33.440 align:start position:0%
um that's news to me other discussion
 
00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:35.069 align:start position:0%
um that's news to me other discussion
representative

00:56:35.069 --> 00:56:35.079 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:56:39.589 --> 00:56:39.599 align:start position:0%
Shapero yes thank you Mr chair
 
00:56:42.670 --> 00:56:42.680 align:start position:0%
um you know people have said already
 
00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
that this doesn't change the fact that
 
00:56:46.589 --> 00:56:46.599 align:start position:0%
we can change birth certificates it just
 
00:56:48.950 --> 00:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
changes the process of how it's done and
 
00:56:51.549 --> 00:56:51.559 align:start position:0%
it streamlines that process and I know
 
00:56:54.309 --> 00:56:54.319 align:start position:0%
we've heard this bill or this kind of
 
00:56:56.870 --> 00:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
bill for years now and one of the things
 
00:56:59.190 --> 00:56:59.200 align:start position:0%
that always stood out for me was people
 
00:57:01.589 --> 00:57:01.599 align:start position:0%
talking about the subjectivity of the
 
00:57:06.150 --> 00:57:06.160 align:start position:0%
process as it stands now that um some
 
00:57:08.950 --> 00:57:08.960 align:start position:0%
people might be be go before a judge who
 
00:57:11.390 --> 00:57:11.400 align:start position:0%
reads the law one way and some people
 
00:57:15.309 --> 00:57:15.319 align:start position:0%
another way and so that this will reduce
 
00:57:17.829 --> 00:57:17.839 align:start position:0%
or eliminate that subjectivity about
 
00:57:20.150 --> 00:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
when names are changed and when it
 
00:57:22.829 --> 00:57:22.839 align:start position:0%
doesn't go through Mr chairman could I
 
00:57:23.789 --> 00:57:23.799 align:start position:0%
call a
 
00:57:23.799 --> 00:57:25.309 align:start position:0%
call a
caucus

00:57:25.309 --> 00:57:25.319 align:start position:0%
caucus
 
00:57:29.829 --> 00:57:29.839 align:start position:0%
um great um so I will vote um I I will
 
00:57:33.589 --> 00:57:33.599 align:start position:0%
vote against I feel thank you is a brief
 
00:57:35.190 --> 00:57:35.200 align:start position:0%
one representative L I think five
 
00:57:36.390 --> 00:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
minutes three minutes five minutes
 
00:57:39.230 --> 00:57:39.240 align:start position:0%
something like okay all right brief take
 
00:57:53.789 --> 00:57:53.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:53.799 --> 01:00:32.430 align:start position:0%
 
recess

01:00:32.430 --> 01:00:32.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:35.270 --> 01:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for your patience um any
 
01:00:37.230 --> 01:00:37.240 align:start position:0%
other discussion on this um on this
 
01:00:39.470 --> 01:00:39.480 align:start position:0%
motion or this
 
01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
bill representative kushman thank you I
 
01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
just wanted to follow up on that thought
 
01:00:47.230 --> 01:00:47.240 align:start position:0%
um about the birth certificate change
 
01:00:49.549 --> 01:00:49.559 align:start position:0%
process for children in adoption
 
01:00:51.910 --> 01:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
proceedings and even
 
01:00:55.589 --> 01:00:55.599 align:start position:0%
um uh like um uh yeah it's the only
 
01:00:58.470 --> 01:00:58.480 align:start position:0%
adoption those those require going
 
01:01:01.990 --> 01:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
through the court um you know there is a
 
01:01:03.589 --> 01:01:03.599 align:start position:0%
and I understand there's the issue with
 
01:01:05.710 --> 01:01:05.720 align:start position:0%
the judges and and discretion and they
 
01:01:08.430 --> 01:01:08.440 align:start position:0%
say that the laws are vague often but um
 
01:01:10.589 --> 01:01:10.599 align:start position:0%
if that's that's truly a problem then we
 
01:01:12.270 --> 01:01:12.280 align:start position:0%
need to look at those statutes that
 
01:01:14.270 --> 01:01:14.280 align:start position:0%
govern how the judges make those
 
01:01:16.150 --> 01:01:16.160 align:start position:0%
decisions and I don't think that we
 
01:01:19.990 --> 01:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
should be um you know allowing you know
 
01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
Vital Records like this to be changed at
 
01:01:25.710 --> 01:01:25.720 align:start position:0%
a lower threshold than we would for
 
01:01:28.870 --> 01:01:28.880 align:start position:0%
adoptions so I will be voting
 
01:01:31.470 --> 01:01:31.480 align:start position:0%
um I will be voting against this Bill
 
01:01:35.630 --> 01:01:35.640 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you other
 
01:01:38.109 --> 01:01:38.119 align:start position:0%

comfortable when she stated that there

Missour yes I think we did we we
 
01:11:43.510 --> 01:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
received a lot of feedback from our
 
01:11:46.070 --> 01:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
community and our state on this subject
 
01:11:48.030 --> 01:11:48.040 align:start position:0%
have you as you've seen the email
 
01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
streaming in right and um and citizens
 
01:11:56.310 --> 01:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
are constituents are concerned with the
 
01:11:58.149 --> 01:11:58.159 align:start position:0%
potential of making New Hampshire a
 
01:12:00.790 --> 01:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
sanctuary State um those are the words
 
01:12:02.590 --> 01:12:02.600 align:start position:0%
that they are using for this bill and a
 
01:12:04.390 --> 01:12:04.400 align:start position:0%
lot of them have done their research on
 
01:12:08.149 --> 01:12:08.159 align:start position:0%
it um so I personally am going to listen
 
01:12:11.310 --> 01:12:11.320 align:start position:0%
to the flood of messages I have received
 
01:12:14.229 --> 01:12:14.239 align:start position:0%
about this even as we just walked in the
 
01:12:16.990 --> 01:12:17.000 align:start position:0%
door today they were still flooding in
 
01:12:21.189 --> 01:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
um so that's why I'm going with the itl
 
01:12:24.830 --> 01:12:24.840 align:start position:0%
motion thank you other discussion
 
01:12:26.830 --> 01:12:26.840 align:start position:0%
representative plaz
 
01:12:31.510 --> 01:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
off uh I think uh this type of secession
 
01:12:33.390 --> 01:12:33.400 align:start position:0%
move is very
 
01:12:35.950 --> 01:12:35.960 align:start position:0%
questionable uh so I'm not comfortable
 
01:12:38.470 --> 01:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
with passing it without further
 
01:12:41.390 --> 01:12:41.400 align:start position:0%
study thank you representative Weber
 
01:12:42.870 --> 01:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
sorry I wasn't sure you had your hand up
 
01:12:48.110 --> 01:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
before quite all right um I'm going to
 
01:12:50.590 --> 01:12:50.600 align:start position:0%
vote against an itl motion because I
 
01:12:52.430 --> 01:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
think that
 
01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:55.070 align:start position:0%
think that
um

01:12:55.070 --> 01:12:55.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:57.229 --> 01:12:57.239 align:start position:0%
we have heard a great deal from both
 
01:13:02.030 --> 01:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
sides of this particular question and I
 
01:13:04.709 --> 01:13:04.719 align:start position:0%
think it is incredibly
 
01:13:07.390 --> 01:13:07.400 align:start position:0%
important that we
 
01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:08.990 align:start position:0%
important that we
support

01:13:08.990 --> 01:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:13:12.790 --> 01:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
those who are in the midst of a very
 
01:13:15.709 --> 01:13:15.719 align:start position:0%
difficult journey and that we affirm the
 
01:13:21.070 --> 01:13:21.080 align:start position:0%
rights of individuals and their parents
 
01:13:24.790 --> 01:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
to make these decisions
 
01:13:26.950 --> 01:13:26.960 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:13:31.229 --> 01:13:31.239 align:start position:0%
um get the treatments that they believe
 
01:13:35.430 --> 01:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
they need in a caring and medically
 
01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:38.550 align:start position:0%
they need in a caring and medically
sensitive

01:13:38.550 --> 01:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:41.870 --> 01:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
way okay representative Reed thank you
 
01:13:43.590 --> 01:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I don't you might want to
 
01:13:45.790 --> 01:13:45.800 align:start position:0%
move your microphone closer to you I
 
01:13:48.750 --> 01:13:48.760 align:start position:0%
don't think New Hampshire is a mecca for
 
01:13:52.950 --> 01:13:52.960 align:start position:0%
gender affirming care or surgery um I
 
01:13:54.110 --> 01:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
just don't don't
 
01:13:57.229 --> 01:13:57.239 align:start position:0%
see why we should go here if people
 
01:13:59.870 --> 01:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
aren't requesting service you know
 
01:14:01.790 --> 01:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
surgeries and treatment from New
 
01:14:04.030 --> 01:14:04.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to begin with and my other
 
01:14:08.870 --> 01:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
concern is down the road um what is our
 
01:14:12.990 --> 01:14:13.000 align:start position:0%
liability for um miners who come to New
 
01:14:15.390 --> 01:14:15.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for surgery then down the road
 
01:14:17.790 --> 01:14:17.800 align:start position:0%
feel they made an error could they come
 
01:14:21.629 --> 01:14:21.639 align:start position:0%
back and sue our inst our hospitals
 
01:14:24.830 --> 01:14:24.840 align:start position:0%
doctors and the state for treatment they
 
01:14:28.350 --> 01:14:28.360 align:start position:0%
received as a minor thank you thank
 
01:14:33.669 --> 01:14:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:38.430 --> 01:14:38.440 align:start position:0%
Canon um I too also received many uh
 
01:14:40.950 --> 01:14:40.960 align:start position:0%
requests to pass this
 
01:14:44.350 --> 01:14:44.360 align:start position:0%
bill this bill does not change the
 
01:14:47.149 --> 01:14:47.159 align:start position:0%
services we currently offer all New
 
01:14:47.159 --> 01:14:48.910 align:start position:0%
services we currently offer all New
Hampshire

01:14:48.910 --> 01:14:48.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:14:52.110 --> 01:14:52.120 align:start position:0%
families this bill would protect our
 
01:14:54.030 --> 01:14:54.040 align:start position:0%
medical professionals
 
01:14:56.550 --> 01:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
and and have the ability for them to
 
01:14:58.629 --> 01:14:58.639 align:start position:0%
retain the information about the
 
01:15:00.229 --> 01:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
services and care that they have
 
01:15:03.149 --> 01:15:03.159 align:start position:0%
provided a family and the
 
01:15:07.830 --> 01:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
patient uh no no more no less the the
 
01:15:10.910 --> 01:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
thing that they would be protected from
 
01:15:13.790 --> 01:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
would be uh the inquiry from out of
 
01:15:17.430 --> 01:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
state for that information to be used to
 
01:15:19.830 --> 01:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
prosecute a family for taking care of
 
01:15:23.709 --> 01:15:23.719 align:start position:0%
their child um that is the simple
 
01:15:26.590 --> 01:15:26.600 align:start position:0%
um part of this bill I know that people
 
01:15:29.229 --> 01:15:29.239 align:start position:0%
have referred to it as a sanctuary Bill
 
01:15:30.910 --> 01:15:30.920 align:start position:0%
if they want to stay here in New
 
01:15:33.550 --> 01:15:33.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I would love to have them stay
 
01:15:36.629 --> 01:15:36.639 align:start position:0%
it people from outside New Hampshire are
 
01:15:40.669 --> 01:15:40.679 align:start position:0%
already coming to New Hampshire for care
 
01:15:43.070 --> 01:15:43.080 align:start position:0%
we don't offer them anything else in
 
01:15:45.070 --> 01:15:45.080 align:start position:0%
addition to what we currently Pro
 
01:15:48.669 --> 01:15:48.679 align:start position:0%
provide our own residents so uh
 
01:15:52.550 --> 01:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
it I would I'm not going to vote for itl
 
01:15:56.070 --> 01:15:56.080 align:start position:0%
on this bill I'm G to F vote to pass it
 
01:15:58.470 --> 01:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Leon um thank
 
01:16:01.189 --> 01:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you for that
 
01:16:03.550 --> 01:16:03.560 align:start position:0%
um I am concerned about the idea of
 
01:16:05.229 --> 01:16:05.239 align:start position:0%
doctors being subpoena from out of state
 
01:16:06.550 --> 01:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
and that's why I had hoped we would be
 
01:16:08.390 --> 01:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
able to work on an interim study on this
 
01:16:11.030 --> 01:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
in order to address that um as the bill
 
01:16:13.110 --> 01:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
stands I can't support it um in its
 
01:16:15.189 --> 01:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
current state and that's the basis of my
 
01:16:17.030 --> 01:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
position but I know that we've tried to
 
01:16:18.390 --> 01:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
work together on this to get to
 
01:16:20.070 --> 01:16:20.080 align:start position:0%
agreement even if that may not be
 
01:16:23.189 --> 01:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
possible this time thank you
 
01:16:24.910 --> 01:16:24.920 align:start position:0%
representative Lyn yeah you know it
 
01:16:27.870 --> 01:16:27.880 align:start position:0%
strikes me that I I think I'm going to
 
01:16:29.590 --> 01:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
support the itl because I really do
 
01:16:31.629 --> 01:16:31.639 align:start position:0%
think this is a
 
01:16:34.870 --> 01:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
bad this this addresses this issue in a
 
01:16:36.790 --> 01:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
in what I think is an inappropriate way
 
01:16:38.270 --> 01:16:38.280 align:start position:0%
I think that there is a real question
 
01:16:39.629 --> 01:16:39.639 align:start position:0%
don't get me wrong I think there's a
 
01:16:43.870 --> 01:16:43.880 align:start position:0%
real question whether a state could
 
01:16:46.310 --> 01:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
could enact a law to prosecute somebody
 
01:16:48.390 --> 01:16:48.400 align:start position:0%
for getting gender affirming care in
 
01:16:50.870 --> 01:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
another state even if you're a citizen
 
01:16:53.110 --> 01:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
in other words if I'm a citizen of tech
 
01:16:55.149 --> 01:16:55.159 align:start position:0%
Texas and I come to New Hampshire to get
 
01:16:57.430 --> 01:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
gender affirming care in New Hampshire
 
01:16:59.189 --> 01:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure whether Texas could
 
01:17:00.830 --> 01:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
prosecute me for that that might that
 
01:17:02.550 --> 01:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
might be unconstitutional itself I don't
 
01:17:05.910 --> 01:17:05.920 align:start position:0%
know the answer to that but if it is
 
01:17:09.390 --> 01:17:09.400 align:start position:0%
constitutional for Texas to regulate
 
01:17:12.030 --> 01:17:12.040 align:start position:0%
citizens of Texas getting out of state
 
01:17:14.830 --> 01:17:14.840 align:start position:0%
gender affirming care then it seems to
 
01:17:17.629 --> 01:17:17.639 align:start position:0%
me that it's really it really would be
 
01:17:19.790 --> 01:17:19.800 align:start position:0%
making for New Hampshire to then say
 
01:17:20.790 --> 01:17:20.800 align:start position:0%
we're not going to give you the
 
01:17:23.149 --> 01:17:23.159 align:start position:0%
information even though you can legally
 
01:17:27.229 --> 01:17:27.239 align:start position:0%
and constitutionally take action uh uh
 
01:17:28.950 --> 01:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
you know against a citizen who gets
 
01:17:31.149 --> 01:17:31.159 align:start position:0%
gender affirming care in another state
 
01:17:33.510 --> 01:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
that just strikes me as that is sort of
 
01:17:35.990 --> 01:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
be taking the position that New
 
01:17:37.910 --> 01:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is going to be a sanctuary
 
01:17:40.430 --> 01:17:40.440 align:start position:0%
that will not give that information and
 
01:17:41.629 --> 01:17:41.639 align:start position:0%
I frankly there could be a
 
01:17:43.950 --> 01:17:43.960 align:start position:0%
constitutional issue as to that also
 
01:17:45.390 --> 01:17:45.400 align:start position:0%
whether New Hampshire could actually do
 
01:17:49.070 --> 01:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
that assuming that it's legal for Texas
 
01:17:52.990 --> 01:17:53.000 align:start position:0%
in my example to to make it to to to to
 
01:17:54.790 --> 01:17:54.800 align:start position:0%
to prosecute somebody for getting gender
 
01:17:56.750 --> 01:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
affirming care in another state I
 
01:17:59.110 --> 01:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
frankly have S significant doubt that
 
01:18:01.629 --> 01:18:01.639 align:start position:0%
Texas could do that in my example but if
 
01:18:04.750 --> 01:18:04.760 align:start position:0%
they could then you know there's no I to
 
01:18:06.189 --> 01:18:06.199 align:start position:0%
me there's no reason for New Hampshire

states in the US uh this is a
 
01:19:45.590 --> 01:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
continuation of the same to offer um a
 
01:19:48.310 --> 01:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
place for people to feel safe to get
 
01:19:51.430 --> 01:19:51.440 align:start position:0%

other
 
01:19:59.950 --> 01:19:59.960 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Missour I have
 
01:20:02.030 --> 01:20:02.040 align:start position:0%
a question of Representative Canon can
 
01:20:04.910 --> 01:20:04.920 align:start position:0%
you tell us which states those
 
01:20:07.669 --> 01:20:07.679 align:start position:0%
are I know for sure California has and
 
01:20:09.510 --> 01:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what the additional states
 
01:20:13.550 --> 01:20:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:16.350 --> 01:20:16.360 align:start position:0%
have other
 
01:20:18.990 --> 01:20:19.000 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
01:20:22.270 --> 01:20:22.280 align:start position:0%
palazov uh I want to say if you want to
 
01:20:23.350 --> 01:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
make this
 
01:20:26.270 --> 01:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
radical step of removing New Hampshire
 
01:20:29.350 --> 01:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
from the union policing framework we
 
01:20:31.910 --> 01:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
need at least to study it and next year
 
01:20:35.709 --> 01:20:35.719 align:start position:0%
there will be some legislation on to
 
01:20:38.590 --> 01:20:38.600 align:start position:0%
create a commission to study processes
 
01:20:42.709 --> 01:20:42.719 align:start position:0%
like that so I urge my colleagues not to
 
01:20:46.629 --> 01:20:46.639 align:start position:0%
hurry with this Bill thank you thank
 
01:20:50.590 --> 01:20:50.600 align:start position:0%
you other discussion representative
 
01:20:54.470 --> 01:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
merant thank you Mr chair
 
01:20:56.910 --> 01:20:56.920 align:start position:0%
I think this bill fundamentally goes to
 
01:21:01.790 --> 01:21:01.800 align:start position:0%
the heart of it critical issue one it
 
01:21:05.510 --> 01:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
protects the sanctimony of the patient
 
01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:06.590 align:start position:0%
protects the sanctimony of the patient
pH

01:21:06.590 --> 01:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
pH
 
01:21:09.310 --> 01:21:09.320 align:start position:0%
relationship which we hold sacred in our
 
01:21:12.030 --> 01:21:12.040 align:start position:0%
country and that physician providers and
 
01:21:15.870 --> 01:21:15.880 align:start position:0%
Healthcare and so forth first Do no harm
 
01:21:17.950 --> 01:21:17.960 align:start position:0%
and if we want to protect that I think
 
01:21:20.590 --> 01:21:20.600 align:start position:0%
we need to have the protection for that
 
01:21:22.030 --> 01:21:22.040 align:start position:0%
number two we also talk about the
 
01:21:24.629 --> 01:21:24.639 align:start position:0%
sanctity of the parent and a parent have
 
01:21:26.470 --> 01:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
the ability to make rights and decisions
 
01:21:29.669 --> 01:21:29.679 align:start position:0%
for the children we hold that dear to us
 
01:21:32.709 --> 01:21:32.719 align:start position:0%
as well all this bill in my opinion is
 
01:21:35.030 --> 01:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
doing is protecting those two
 
01:21:38.390 --> 01:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
fundamental beliefs that we have in our
 
01:21:41.950 --> 01:21:41.960 align:start position:0%
country the right to have medical care
 
01:21:43.950 --> 01:21:43.960 align:start position:0%
based upon what you think is right
 
01:21:46.070 --> 01:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
between you and the position and not
 
01:21:47.790 --> 01:21:47.800 align:start position:0%
having the state getting involved with
 
01:21:51.149 --> 01:21:51.159 align:start position:0%
that and two the right of the parent to
 
01:21:53.390 --> 01:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
guide the Journey of their child and not
 
01:21:54.870 --> 01:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
have the state get in the middle of that
 
01:21:57.470 --> 01:21:57.480 align:start position:0%
either so I see this really as a bill as
 
01:21:59.629 --> 01:21:59.639 align:start position:0%
protecting those fundamental freedoms
 
01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
that we've come to enjoy so dearly in
 
01:22:05.950 --> 01:22:05.960 align:start position:0%
our country thank you thank you other
 
01:22:08.189 --> 01:22:08.199 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
01:22:11.070 --> 01:22:11.080 align:start position:0%
Canon I have a list of states that have
 
01:22:13.430 --> 01:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
passed laws similar to this uh
 
01:22:16.790 --> 01:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
California Colorado Illinois Maryland
 
01:22:18.669 --> 01:22:18.679 align:start position:0%
New Mexico and
 
01:22:21.110 --> 01:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
Minnesota thank
 
01:22:23.189 --> 01:22:23.199 align:start position:0%
you and represent
 
01:22:26.070 --> 01:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
chapero thank you Mr chair I
 
01:22:28.750 --> 01:22:28.760 align:start position:0%
would piggyback on um what
 
01:22:31.510 --> 01:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant said um which is
 
01:22:34.830 --> 01:22:34.840 align:start position:0%
to say that this bill will also protect
 
01:22:39.510 --> 01:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
um privacy and confidentiality um which
 
01:22:42.629 --> 01:22:42.639 align:start position:0%
this state values tremendously and which
 
01:22:45.830 --> 01:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
is part of the whole Foundation of
 
01:22:49.510 --> 01:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
medical care that people will have um
 
01:22:51.790 --> 01:22:51.800 align:start position:0%
confidentiality in getting that care and
 
01:22:53.790 --> 01:22:53.800 align:start position:0%
their records will be
 
01:22:55.510 --> 01:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
protected thank
 
01:22:58.669 --> 01:22:58.679 align:start position:0%
you other discussion representative Leon
 
01:23:00.870 --> 01:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman um I agree
 
01:23:02.310 --> 01:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
about the necessity to protect the
 
01:23:04.550 --> 01:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
privacy of medical records um I'm just
 
01:23:06.910 --> 01:23:06.920 align:start position:0%
concerned about doing it on a case-by
 
01:23:09.030 --> 01:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
casee basis um I actually do have a bill
 
01:23:10.709 --> 01:23:10.719 align:start position:0%
in for next year that would strengthen
 
01:23:13.030 --> 01:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
the protections of medical records and
 
01:23:14.750 --> 01:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
I'm hopeful that we can address
 
01:23:17.149 --> 01:23:17.159 align:start position:0%
holistically how that relationship needs
 
01:23:19.070 --> 01:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
to be protected in that manner but I
 
01:23:21.070 --> 01:23:21.080 align:start position:0%
think doing it Case by case is less
 
01:23:23.030 --> 01:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
effective than overall
 
01:23:24.669 --> 01:23:24.679 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm glad that we all share the
 
01:23:26.390 --> 01:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
the respect for patient privacy and the
 
01:23:28.270 --> 01:23:28.280 align:start position:0%
doctor patient relationship it's always
 
01:23:29.950 --> 01:23:29.960 align:start position:0%
good when we have agreement even when
 
01:23:31.270 --> 01:23:31.280 align:start position:0%
there's some areas where we do have
 
01:23:33.350 --> 01:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
disagreement on how to do
 
01:23:36.870 --> 01:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
things other discussion representative
 
01:23:39.910 --> 01:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
Shapero I I would agree generally with
 
01:23:43.149 --> 01:23:43.159 align:start position:0%
representative Leon um but I think the
 
01:23:46.709 --> 01:23:46.719 align:start position:0%
reason for singling this issue out is
 
01:23:49.070 --> 01:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
because there is talk from other states
 
01:23:51.270 --> 01:23:51.280 align:start position:0%
about Prosecuting people who go to
 
01:23:53.830 --> 01:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
another state I I I don't know if any
 
01:23:57.030 --> 01:23:57.040 align:start position:0%
states are doing that um but it's
 
01:24:00.430 --> 01:24:00.440 align:start position:0%
certainly um in the public discourse
 
01:24:02.990 --> 01:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
that that's being talked about both for
 
01:24:07.070 --> 01:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:10.350 --> 01:24:10.360 align:start position:0%
care other representative kosman thank
 
01:24:15.189 --> 01:24:15.199 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um my my concerns are
 
01:24:17.390 --> 01:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
not only with the constitutionality of
 
01:24:20.790 --> 01:24:20.800 align:start position:0%
it um but also the complexities um that
 
01:24:23.350 --> 01:24:23.360 align:start position:0%
might come from this bill being passed
 
01:24:26.350 --> 01:24:26.360 align:start position:0%
um consider cases where um parental
 
01:24:29.590 --> 01:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
rights are terminated for one parent or
 
01:24:32.110 --> 01:24:32.120 align:start position:0%
where um they're in the middle of court
 
01:24:35.910 --> 01:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
and someone takes the kid to a state um
 
01:24:39.310 --> 01:24:39.320 align:start position:0%
like ours if we had this pass and um you
 
01:24:40.790 --> 01:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
know what's going to be the legal
 
01:24:42.629 --> 01:24:42.639 align:start position:0%
Fallout for that and if later one of the
 
01:24:45.350 --> 01:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
parents ends up suing then they have no
 
01:24:47.390 --> 01:24:47.400 align:start position:0%
right to get any of the medical
 
01:24:49.470 --> 01:24:49.480 align:start position:0%
information on their child if this bill
 
01:24:52.030 --> 01:24:52.040 align:start position:0%
is passed um and I don't think that that
 
01:24:54.109 --> 01:24:54.119 align:start position:0%
would be be right either um so I think
 
01:24:57.470 --> 01:24:57.480 align:start position:0%
it's just too complex of legal issues
 
01:25:00.510 --> 01:25:00.520 align:start position:0%
that haven't really been parsed out um
 
01:25:03.709 --> 01:25:03.719 align:start position:0%
to the Fine detail and uh I think that
 
01:25:05.669 --> 01:25:05.679 align:start position:0%
we can sit back and we can see how other
 
01:25:07.870 --> 01:25:07.880 align:start position:0%
states are doing this um and
 
01:25:09.910 --> 01:25:09.920 align:start position:0%
additionally I think it flies in the
 
01:25:13.149 --> 01:25:13.159 align:start position:0%
face of like um the the rights states
 
01:25:14.709 --> 01:25:14.719 align:start position:0%
are meant to do things a little bit
 
01:25:17.189 --> 01:25:17.199 align:start position:0%
differently you know we all have
 
01:25:19.629 --> 01:25:19.639 align:start position:0%
different cultures different populations
 
01:25:22.470 --> 01:25:22.480 align:start position:0%
and one state may do things um different
 
01:25:24.030 --> 01:25:24.040 align:start position:0%
ly than another and I think that trying
 
01:25:28.189 --> 01:25:28.199 align:start position:0%
to prosecute um someone for some in one
 
01:25:29.709 --> 01:25:29.719 align:start position:0%
state for something they did in another
 
01:25:32.510 --> 01:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
state whether it's an abortion or um you
 
01:25:35.790 --> 01:25:35.800 align:start position:0%
know a transexual um a gender genital
 
01:25:39.229 --> 01:25:39.239 align:start position:0%
surgery um you know I don't I don't see
 
01:25:41.310 --> 01:25:41.320 align:start position:0%
how that's going to apply and I don't
 
01:25:44.950 --> 01:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
agree on principle in making laws that
 
01:25:47.430 --> 01:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
um would stop another state from
 
01:25:49.870 --> 01:25:49.880 align:start position:0%
enforcing their own laws thank
 
01:25:54.669 --> 01:25:54.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:57.109 --> 01:25:57.119 align:start position:0%
saying no other discussion the motion is
 
01:25:59.910 --> 01:25:59.920 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on House Bill 368 I'll ask
 
01:26:01.550 --> 01:26:01.560 align:start position:0%

need one for an uh interim study right
 
01:27:19.229 --> 01:27:19.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:22.669 --> 01:27:22.679 align:start position:0%
we if we don't need one we won't do one
 
01:27:25.229 --> 01:27:25.239 align:start position:0%
or do we need
 
01:27:28.550 --> 01:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
one um we can choose to have um there's
 
01:27:29.990 --> 01:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
there's a different position so we could
 
01:27:31.669 --> 01:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
either choose to have itl or interim
 
01:27:34.189 --> 01:27:34.199 align:start position:0%
study but we're choosing to do itl okay
 
01:27:37.149 --> 01:27:37.159 align:start position:0%
yeah you can't you can't have both we we
 
01:27:40.310 --> 01:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
don't normally have three okay so just
 
01:27:43.629 --> 01:27:43.639 align:start position:0%
so uh the the choice is up to the the
 
01:27:46.350 --> 01:27:46.360 align:start position:0%
group as to which one of those they will
 
01:27:48.350 --> 01:27:48.360 align:start position:0%
choose okay so we'll just do those two
 
01:27:51.950 --> 01:27:51.960 align:start position:0%

chairman um I move that we adopt
 
01:28:01.199 --> 01:28:02.629 align:start position:0%
chairman um I move that we adopt
amendment

01:28:02.629 --> 01:28:02.639 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:28:07.070 --> 01:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
2023-24 48h to House Bill
 
01:28:10.189 --> 01:28:10.199 align:start position:0%
378 okay is there a second second
 
01:28:12.109 --> 01:28:12.119 align:start position:0%
representative weo seconds
 
01:28:13.430 --> 01:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
representative Lon do you want to speak
 
01:28:15.350 --> 01:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
to your motion um yes thank you Mr
 
01:28:18.870 --> 01:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
chairman uh this is a bill that came
 
01:28:21.149 --> 01:28:21.159 align:start position:0%
about because even though we have laws
 
01:28:23.310 --> 01:28:23.320 align:start position:0%
that establish right for survivors of
 
01:28:26.590 --> 01:28:26.600 align:start position:0%
sexual assault not everybody who is
 
01:28:29.149 --> 01:28:29.159 align:start position:0%
involved in the care and treatment is
 
01:28:31.149 --> 01:28:31.159 align:start position:0%
fully aware of this and unfortunately we
 
01:28:34.109 --> 01:28:34.119 align:start position:0%
have had survivors uh turned away and
 
01:28:37.470 --> 01:28:37.480 align:start position:0%
turned away and made unable to um
 
01:28:40.229 --> 01:28:40.239 align:start position:0%
actually have their rights protected um
 
01:28:42.189 --> 01:28:42.199 align:start position:0%
we had walked through the different
 
01:28:43.910 --> 01:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
processes of how to do this we had
 
01:28:45.470 --> 01:28:45.480 align:start position:0%
originally looked to put some of this
 
01:28:47.790 --> 01:28:47.800 align:start position:0%
into the statutes um to take the best
 
01:28:50.510 --> 01:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
practices that are in the um that are
 
01:28:52.149 --> 01:28:52.159 align:start position:0%
already created by the department of
 
01:28:54.390 --> 01:28:54.400 align:start position:0%
Justice in order to have um these these
 
01:28:57.270 --> 01:28:57.280 align:start position:0%
policies and procedures um with looking
 
01:28:58.950 --> 01:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
on feedback that we had from the
 
01:29:00.990 --> 01:29:01.000 align:start position:0%
Coalition against Dom Domestic and
 
01:29:03.390 --> 01:29:03.400 align:start position:0%
Sexual Violence and feedback from others
 
01:29:05.390 --> 01:29:05.400 align:start position:0%
um what we realized that was the best
 
01:29:08.189 --> 01:29:08.199 align:start position:0%
and cleanest approach was to charge the
 
01:29:10.550 --> 01:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice to make um summary
 
01:29:13.229 --> 01:29:13.239 align:start position:0%
document or documents for sexual assault
 
01:29:15.350 --> 01:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
survivors and those who provide care for
 
01:29:17.550 --> 01:29:17.560 align:start position:0%
them or interact with them so that they
 
01:29:19.870 --> 01:29:19.880 align:start position:0%
can have those pertinent parts of the
 
01:29:23.229 --> 01:29:23.239 align:start position:0%
rights so that uh Survivor would know
 
01:29:25.870 --> 01:29:25.880 align:start position:0%
whether or not they would be eligible to
 
01:29:29.030 --> 01:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
have the have the test kit done in order
 
01:29:31.590 --> 01:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
to pot hopefully bring Justice to the
 
01:29:34.189 --> 01:29:34.199 align:start position:0%
perpetrator um one of the areas that
 
01:29:35.629 --> 01:29:35.639 align:start position:0%
we've heard about the challenges of
 
01:29:37.390 --> 01:29:37.400 align:start position:0%
Prosecuting cases is that people don't
 
01:29:39.430 --> 01:29:39.440 align:start position:0%
AR always have the evidence that they
 
01:29:42.229 --> 01:29:42.239 align:start position:0%
need and so this does also include that
 
01:29:43.470 --> 01:29:43.480 align:start position:0%
it's helpful to bring the clothes you
 
01:29:44.950 --> 01:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
were wearing because bringing the
 
01:29:47.390 --> 01:29:47.400 align:start position:0%
clothes that you wearing um is one of
 
01:29:48.790 --> 01:29:48.800 align:start position:0%
those parts that will help you get some
 
01:29:51.910 --> 01:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
of that evidence so by dovetailing into
 
01:29:54.070 --> 01:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
to the existing protocol and simply
 
01:29:57.070 --> 01:29:57.080 align:start position:0%
adding an additional um an additional
 
01:29:59.430 --> 01:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
document that summarizes the 100 plus
 
01:30:01.629 --> 01:30:01.639 align:start position:0%
documents already available it makes it
 
01:30:03.950 --> 01:30:03.960 align:start position:0%
more accessible especially for survivors
 
01:30:05.270 --> 01:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
when they're trying to go from being a
 
01:30:08.430 --> 01:30:08.440 align:start position:0%
victim to a Survivor and this was
 
01:30:11.070 --> 01:30:11.080 align:start position:0%
adopted and there was a um this
 
01:30:12.830 --> 01:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
amendment was adopted and they ought to
 
01:30:14.830 --> 01:30:14.840 align:start position:0%
pass recommend as amended recommendation
 
01:30:17.990 --> 01:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
pass the subcommittee 6 to zero this
 
01:30:21.149 --> 01:30:21.159 align:start position:0%
morning okay thank you other discussion
 
01:30:23.149 --> 01:30:23.159 align:start position:0%
my representative
 
01:30:26.470 --> 01:30:26.480 align:start position:0%
pmer I just have have thank you I just
 
01:30:28.950 --> 01:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
have a sort of question uh in general
 
01:30:31.070 --> 01:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
which is that I know the Coalition had
 
01:30:33.109 --> 01:30:33.119 align:start position:0%
some concerns because they had not much
 
01:30:35.870 --> 01:30:35.880 align:start position:0%
time to look at this am I correct in
 
01:30:38.189 --> 01:30:38.199 align:start position:0%
assuming that they would be able to have
 
01:30:39.910 --> 01:30:39.920 align:start position:0%
input to the justice department and how
 
01:30:42.229 --> 01:30:42.239 align:start position:0%
they set up these rules and therefore
 
01:30:44.310 --> 01:30:44.320 align:start position:0%
could maybe elay some of the concerns
 
01:30:46.390 --> 01:30:46.400 align:start position:0%
they might have that way representative
 
01:30:48.109 --> 01:30:48.119 align:start position:0%
Leon um thank you by doing it through
 
01:30:50.350 --> 01:30:50.360 align:start position:0%
administrative rules the Coalition
 
01:30:52.709 --> 01:30:52.719 align:start position:0%
anybody here on this committee any
 
01:30:55.350 --> 01:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
citizen the police departments and
 
01:30:57.430 --> 01:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
anybody involved in this process will be
 
01:30:59.270 --> 01:30:59.280 align:start position:0%
able to participate in the hearings as
 
01:31:02.510 --> 01:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
these are created and um guide and shape
 
01:31:04.270 --> 01:31:04.280 align:start position:0%
the document to make sure that it best
 
01:31:06.390 --> 01:31:06.400 align:start position:0%
reflects the needs of the different
 
01:31:08.390 --> 01:31:08.400 align:start position:0%
communities thank you representative
 
01:31:11.229 --> 01:31:11.239 align:start position:0%
pazo I'm sorry then representative Weber
 
01:31:16.430 --> 01:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
go ahead um just uh represent uh could
 
01:31:20.149 --> 01:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
you briefly explain uh how it changes
 
01:31:23.709 --> 01:31:23.719 align:start position:0%
the the regional Bill and for example if
 
01:31:26.109 --> 01:31:26.119 align:start position:0%
I remember correctly the original bill
 
01:31:30.470 --> 01:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
was trying to expand cases when uh rape
 
01:31:33.030 --> 01:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
protocol could be used if somebody is
 
01:31:36.270 --> 01:31:36.280 align:start position:0%
drugged or otherwise
 
01:31:38.430 --> 01:31:38.440 align:start position:0%
impacted um thank you the original
 
01:31:40.350 --> 01:31:40.360 align:start position:0%
request for the bill did not seek to
 
01:31:42.030 --> 01:31:42.040 align:start position:0%
expand it but the way that it was worded
 
01:31:44.830 --> 01:31:44.840 align:start position:0%
it did um one of the other areas that
 
01:31:47.750 --> 01:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
that was improved in this amendment is
 
01:31:49.750 --> 01:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
um is making clear that if somebody is
 
01:31:51.950 --> 01:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
reporting an attempted rape that you can
 
01:31:53.790 --> 01:31:53.800 align:start position:0%
that you can figure out if a misdemeanor
 
01:31:56.189 --> 01:31:56.199 align:start position:0%
sexual assault happened so perhaps that
 
01:31:58.350 --> 01:31:58.360 align:start position:0%
they were drugged and while they didn't
 
01:32:00.470 --> 01:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
get to the ultimate fulfillment of rape
 
01:32:02.709 --> 01:32:02.719 align:start position:0%
they were groped in the process that is
 
01:32:04.550 --> 01:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
a crime that's misdemeanor sexual
 
01:32:06.870 --> 01:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
assault and that's already provided for
 
01:32:10.470 --> 01:32:10.480 align:start position:0%
in the protocols uh because we do so
 
01:32:11.990 --> 01:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
much and we rely so much on the sex
 
01:32:14.910 --> 01:32:14.920 align:start position:0%
offender registry that making sure that
 
01:32:17.590 --> 01:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
even those who do not reach their full
 
01:32:19.830 --> 01:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
success in committing these sex crimes
 
01:32:22.390 --> 01:32:22.400 align:start position:0%
do get on that registry then they're not
 
01:32:23.910 --> 01:32:23.920 align:start position:0%
going to be able to be a Boy Scout
 
01:32:25.270 --> 01:32:25.280 align:start position:0%
leader they're not going to be able to
 
01:32:26.470 --> 01:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
be a teacher they're not going to be
 
01:32:27.790 --> 01:32:27.800 align:start position:0%
able to volunteer in a school because
 
01:32:29.910 --> 01:32:29.920 align:start position:0%
they're a sex offender so taking even
 
01:32:31.790 --> 01:32:31.800 align:start position:0%
these cases where a victim is able a
 
01:32:33.910 --> 01:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
Survivor is able to get away and making
 
01:32:35.430 --> 01:32:35.440 align:start position:0%
sure that we provide them the rights
 
01:32:37.750 --> 01:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
that are already established is key um
 
01:32:39.470 --> 01:32:39.480 align:start position:0%
we just cleaned up the language to
 
01:32:41.750 --> 01:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
instead of putting the cases before the
 
01:32:44.310 --> 01:32:44.320 align:start position:0%
statutes we said any individual who
 
01:32:45.830 --> 01:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
asserts that they've been subject to an
 
01:32:48.550 --> 01:32:48.560 align:start position:0%
offense under the aggravated felonius
 
01:32:51.189 --> 01:32:51.199 align:start position:0%
felonius and misdemeanor sex assault and
 
01:32:54.470 --> 01:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
then say in including but not limited to
 
01:32:56.390 --> 01:32:56.400 align:start position:0%
and putting it into terms that people
 
01:32:59.669 --> 01:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
can better understand um specifically so
 
01:33:02.030 --> 01:33:02.040 align:start position:0%
that it does not expand the scope uh
 
01:33:03.390 --> 01:33:03.400 align:start position:0%
because that was just one of the issues
 
01:33:05.990 --> 01:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
in drafting especially it's one of the
 
01:33:09.149 --> 01:33:09.159 align:start position:0%
reasons why this needs to be so clear it
 
01:33:11.070 --> 01:33:11.080 align:start position:0%
needs to be so clear because if you've
 
01:33:13.590 --> 01:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
experienced this you sometimes look at
 
01:33:15.910 --> 01:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
things and don't don't you read it the
 
01:33:17.709 --> 01:33:17.719 align:start position:0%
way that you think you're reading it but
 
01:33:18.990 --> 01:33:19.000 align:start position:0%
we need to make sure that the
 
01:33:20.830 --> 01:33:20.840 align:start position:0%
information is there when I read
 
01:33:22.510 --> 01:33:22.520 align:start position:0%
attempted rape I thought it was very
 
01:33:24.510 --> 01:33:24.520 align:start position:0%
clear that it was the misdemeanor sexual
 
01:33:27.590 --> 01:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
assault um but we need to make sure that
 
01:33:28.990 --> 01:33:29.000 align:start position:0%
the correct information is in people's
 
01:33:30.550 --> 01:33:30.560 align:start position:0%
hands sorry for going on it's a
 
01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:32.229 align:start position:0%
hands sorry for going on it's a
sensitive

01:33:32.229 --> 01:33:32.239 align:start position:0%
sensitive
 
01:33:36.109 --> 01:33:36.119 align:start position:0%
subject thank you representative wber
 
01:33:37.870 --> 01:33:37.880 align:start position:0%
thank you and I would like to thank
 
01:33:41.270 --> 01:33:41.280 align:start position:0%
everybody involved for the work that has
 
01:33:44.709 --> 01:33:44.719 align:start position:0%
progressed from where we started to hear
 
01:33:49.270 --> 01:33:49.280 align:start position:0%
um I think that the um amendment is uh a
 
01:33:52.790 --> 01:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
huge Improvement in Clarity and and in
 
01:33:56.510 --> 01:33:56.520 align:start position:0%
providing information to survivors
 
01:33:59.790 --> 01:33:59.800 align:start position:0%
without getting in the way of medical
 
01:34:03.470 --> 01:34:03.480 align:start position:0%
treatment or um and and and it may
 
01:34:05.990 --> 01:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
enhance the ability to
 
01:34:09.669 --> 01:34:09.679 align:start position:0%
prosecute uh all of which is good and it
 
01:34:13.149 --> 01:34:13.159 align:start position:0%
also leaves anybody who has been
 
01:34:15.229 --> 01:34:15.239 align:start position:0%
assaulted with the
 
01:34:19.790 --> 01:34:19.800 align:start position:0%
choices of deciding their own fate uh
 
01:34:22.470 --> 01:34:22.480 align:start position:0%
rather than leaving it to other people
 
01:34:25.470 --> 01:34:25.480 align:start position:0%
which is really important uh I am going
 
01:34:28.270 --> 01:34:28.280 align:start position:0%
to vote for the amendment and for the
 
01:34:31.990 --> 01:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as amended I do recognize
 
01:34:35.950 --> 01:34:35.960 align:start position:0%
that the Coalition only saw the final
 
01:34:38.390 --> 01:34:38.400 align:start position:0%
draft which was an attempt to address
 
01:34:40.629 --> 01:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
concerns that they had with the last
 
01:34:43.310 --> 01:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
draft uh recently and they may want to
 
01:34:47.750 --> 01:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
check with um uh other other folks who
 
01:34:51.109 --> 01:34:51.119 align:start position:0%
are not represented here today and there
 
01:34:53.790 --> 01:34:53.800 align:start position:0%
is time between now and the time we vote
 
01:34:57.709 --> 01:34:57.719 align:start position:0%
on it on the house floor if things come
 
01:34:59.030 --> 01:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
to our
 
01:35:02.430 --> 01:35:02.440 align:start position:0%
attention uh we'll deal with whatever
 
01:35:05.270 --> 01:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
that is at the time but uh for now I
 
01:35:07.910 --> 01:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
think that this is a good effort in the
 
01:35:09.950 --> 01:35:09.960 align:start position:0%
right direction so I will be supporting
 
01:35:12.790 --> 01:35:12.800 align:start position:0%
it representative Lon um thank you Mr
 
01:35:14.070 --> 01:35:14.080 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for that
 
01:35:16.950 --> 01:35:16.960 align:start position:0%
representative Weber um we we would make
 
01:35:18.870 --> 01:35:18.880 align:start position:0%
sure want to make sure that any of that
 
01:35:20.709 --> 01:35:20.719 align:start position:0%
is done well ahead of time so that we
 
01:35:22.709 --> 01:35:22.719 align:start position:0%
can we can speak together if there are
 
01:35:25.669 --> 01:35:25.679 align:start position:0%
any concerns this amendment came through
 
01:35:27.590 --> 01:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
so late because we had requested
 
01:35:29.350 --> 01:35:29.360 align:start position:0%
feedback by a certain time period so we
 
01:35:31.629 --> 01:35:31.639 align:start position:0%
could handle it before the other bills
 
01:35:33.470 --> 01:35:33.480 align:start position:0%
um we just want to make sure that we're
 
01:35:36.709 --> 01:35:36.719 align:start position:0%
not in a last minute situation because
 
01:35:38.189 --> 01:35:38.199 align:start position:0%
this is happening the we're going to be
 
01:35:39.910 --> 01:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
on the floor just before the holidays
 
01:35:41.470 --> 01:35:41.480 align:start position:0%
and I'm sorry I don't want to be Rel
 
01:35:43.830 --> 01:35:43.840 align:start position:0%
reliving my sexual assault over
 
01:35:46.950 --> 01:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
Christmas so I hope that if there is
 
01:35:49.030 --> 01:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
anything it's it's done almost
 
01:35:51.030 --> 01:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
immediately so that we can deal with
 
01:35:53.390 --> 01:35:53.400 align:start position:0%
this and put it to bed before the
 
01:35:54.870 --> 01:35:54.880 align:start position:0%

lean do you want to speak to your motion
 
01:41:09.189 --> 01:41:09.199 align:start position:0%
um yes thank you Mr chairman this bill
 
01:41:12.070 --> 01:41:12.080 align:start position:0%
came to us ahead of a lot of monumental
 
01:41:13.830 --> 01:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
changes in the Bureau of Developmental
 
01:41:16.149 --> 01:41:16.159 align:start position:0%
Services um it sought to put a pilot
 
01:41:19.070 --> 01:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
program in before changes including to
 
01:41:22.709 --> 01:41:22.719 align:start position:0%
the um the reimbursement model model um
 
01:41:26.350 --> 01:41:26.360 align:start position:0%
sorry into the direct billing model um
 
01:41:27.470 --> 01:41:27.480 align:start position:0%
we had
 
01:41:31.350 --> 01:41:31.360 align:start position:0%
consider sorry one second uh so it it
 
01:41:33.910 --> 01:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
sought to make changes um to have a
 
01:41:35.870 --> 01:41:35.880 align:start position:0%
pilot program to make sure that all of
 
01:41:38.910 --> 01:41:38.920 align:start position:0%
this was going to proceed and that um hi
 
01:41:41.790 --> 01:41:41.800 align:start position:0%
hiccups could be minimized um the
 
01:41:43.550 --> 01:41:43.560 align:start position:0%
department has been undertaking the
 
01:41:47.350 --> 01:41:47.360 align:start position:0%
herculan task of transitioning over to a
 
01:41:49.750 --> 01:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
direct billing method and while they are
 
01:41:51.950 --> 01:41:51.960 align:start position:0%
putting in a tremendous amount of man
 
01:41:54.830 --> 01:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
hours there continue to be challenges to
 
01:41:57.189 --> 01:41:57.199 align:start position:0%
this um challenges that we heard from
 
01:41:59.070 --> 01:41:59.080 align:start position:0%
the provider Community
 
01:42:03.109 --> 01:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
challenges um where with the the time
 
01:42:04.990 --> 01:42:05.000 align:start position:0%
frame for payments there's the question
 
01:42:06.910 --> 01:42:06.920 align:start position:0%
about fiscal solvency for some of the
 
01:42:09.669 --> 01:42:09.679 align:start position:0%
providers being able to continue to pay
 
01:42:11.830 --> 01:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
what they need to the people that
 
01:42:13.790 --> 01:42:13.800 align:start position:0%
provide services to the developmental
 
01:42:16.830 --> 01:42:16.840 align:start position:0%
community and um after this there's
 
01:42:18.629 --> 01:42:18.639 align:start position:0%
still going to be some other changes
 
01:42:20.189 --> 01:42:20.199 align:start position:0%
there'll be a switch over to the
 
01:42:22.510 --> 01:42:22.520 align:start position:0%
electronic visit verification where the
 
01:42:23.950 --> 01:42:23.960 align:start position:0%
providers need to bring a cell phone
 
01:42:25.790 --> 01:42:25.800 align:start position:0%
with them and check in that they are
 
01:42:28.350 --> 01:42:28.360 align:start position:0%
providing care um and that they are for
 
01:42:30.750 --> 01:42:30.760 align:start position:0%
those Services that's going to be fun in
 
01:42:32.629 --> 01:42:32.639 align:start position:0%
a state like ours where on our caucus
 
01:42:34.669 --> 01:42:34.679 align:start position:0%
several of us dropped off because of
 
01:42:37.310 --> 01:42:37.320 align:start position:0%
internet connection issues so making
 
01:42:39.430 --> 01:42:39.440 align:start position:0%
sure that it's undertaken on a more
 
01:42:41.870 --> 01:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
stepwise fashion uh to at least let a
 
01:42:43.790 --> 01:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
couple people go up to bat first before
 
01:42:46.470 --> 01:42:46.480 align:start position:0%
it goes out to the entire Community
 
01:42:48.990 --> 01:42:49.000 align:start position:0%
would be helpful and what I'm hearing
 
01:42:51.189 --> 01:42:51.199 align:start position:0%
right now is that the department will
 
01:42:52.870 --> 01:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
will is willing to work with just a
 
01:42:54.990 --> 01:42:55.000 align:start position:0%
couple area agencies to iron out the
 
01:42:56.910 --> 01:42:56.920 align:start position:0%
wrinkles for the electronic visit
 
01:42:59.270 --> 01:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
verification that's the last remaining
 
01:43:01.270 --> 01:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
one that's impacting our federal funding
 
01:43:04.030 --> 01:43:04.040 align:start position:0%
because we're already paying some fines
 
01:43:05.750 --> 01:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
but there are additional changes as well
 
01:43:08.270 --> 01:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
that are coming under the A&amp;M um report
 
01:43:11.790 --> 01:43:11.800 align:start position:0%
and some others so this is an area where
 
01:43:13.910 --> 01:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
it's quite possible that we'll need to
 
01:43:16.629 --> 01:43:16.639 align:start position:0%
bring some legislative Solutions next
 
01:43:19.189 --> 01:43:19.199 align:start position:0%
session to see what's happened how we
 
01:43:21.229 --> 01:43:21.239 align:start position:0%
can better support the Deport Department
 
01:43:22.750 --> 01:43:22.760 align:start position:0%
how we can better support the providers
 
01:43:24.550 --> 01:43:24.560 align:start position:0%
and how we can better support the
 
01:43:27.350 --> 01:43:27.360 align:start position:0%
individuals served by the system um and
 
01:43:29.310 --> 01:43:29.320 align:start position:0%
so this is one of those areas where
 
01:43:31.229 --> 01:43:31.239 align:start position:0%
we're going to do an interim study and
 
01:43:32.550 --> 01:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
I'm also hopeful that we'll name a
 
01:43:34.990 --> 01:43:35.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee today with those members
 
01:43:37.470 --> 01:43:37.480 align:start position:0%
from the subcommittee um working on this
 
01:43:39.870 --> 01:43:39.880 align:start position:0%
bill so that we can move forward and
 
01:43:41.229 --> 01:43:41.239 align:start position:0%
just make sure that we're hearing from
 
01:43:43.390 --> 01:43:43.400 align:start position:0%
everybody involved and just make sure
 
01:43:46.430 --> 01:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
that this is proceeding because uh we
 
01:43:47.990 --> 01:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
never want anybody to slip through the
 
01:43:50.790 --> 01:43:50.800 align:start position:0%
cracks and if you have a family who's
 
01:43:52.430 --> 01:43:52.440 align:start position:0%
struggling with supporting their
 
01:43:54.669 --> 01:43:54.679 align:start position:0%
developmentally disabled child or even
 
01:43:56.669 --> 01:43:56.679 align:start position:0%
an adult with developmental disabilities
 
01:43:58.870 --> 01:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
who relies on these state provided
 
01:44:01.149 --> 01:44:01.159 align:start position:0%
Services you know if we're going to help
 
01:44:03.070 --> 01:44:03.080 align:start position:0%
anybody this is who we need to help so I
 
01:44:04.629 --> 01:44:04.639 align:start position:0%
think having some attention and bringing
 
01:44:06.149 --> 01:44:06.159 align:start position:0%
the stakeholders back together to
 
01:44:08.830 --> 01:44:08.840 align:start position:0%
discuss things is going to give us the
 
01:44:11.830 --> 01:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
best solution moving forward um and
 
01:44:13.950 --> 01:44:13.960 align:start position:0%
that's why our subcommittee recommended
 
01:44:16.310 --> 01:44:16.320 align:start position:0%
interim study 6 to zero and wanted to
 
01:44:19.149 --> 01:44:19.159 align:start position:0%
stay involved in this process okay thank
 
01:44:22.709 --> 01:44:22.719 align:start position:0%
you representative Weber and I will just
 
01:44:25.229 --> 01:44:25.239 align:start position:0%
add I I think it's really implied by
 
01:44:29.229 --> 01:44:29.239 align:start position:0%
what was said but uh the what became
 
01:44:31.870 --> 01:44:31.880 align:start position:0%
clear as we talked in the subcommittee
 
01:44:34.830 --> 01:44:34.840 align:start position:0%
was we had the bill which really no
 
01:44:39.390 --> 01:44:39.400 align:start position:0%
longer addressed the issues that are
 
01:44:43.270 --> 01:44:43.280 align:start position:0%
real severe and ongoing but the fact
 
01:44:45.910 --> 01:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
that we were having the
 
01:44:47.990 --> 01:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
conversations allowed better
 
01:44:50.830 --> 01:44:50.840 align:start position:0%
communication between all parties and I
 
01:44:52.070 --> 01:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
think it was the sense of the
 
01:44:54.990 --> 01:44:55.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee members that we want to
 
01:44:58.189 --> 01:44:58.199 align:start position:0%
have ongoing conversations we thought
 
01:45:00.189 --> 01:45:00.199 align:start position:0%
about referring this to Health and Human
 
01:45:02.790 --> 01:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
Services oversight for those we thought
 
01:45:04.709 --> 01:45:04.719 align:start position:0%
about the appointment of an ad hoc
 
01:45:08.390 --> 01:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
special committee by the chair uh but we
 
01:45:10.310 --> 01:45:10.320 align:start position:0%
thought that as long as those of us who
 
01:45:12.790 --> 01:45:12.800 align:start position:0%
were on the subcommittee had already
 
01:45:16.430 --> 01:45:16.440 align:start position:0%
been uh listening to the concerns and
 
01:45:19.310 --> 01:45:19.320 align:start position:0%
dealing with the issues that uh we were
 
01:45:21.470 --> 01:45:21.480 align:start position:0%
committed to go on doing that and we
 
01:45:24.109 --> 01:45:24.119 align:start position:0%
thought that this might be the uh best
 
01:45:26.629 --> 01:45:26.639 align:start position:0%
way to ensure continuity of that
 
01:45:28.470 --> 01:45:28.480 align:start position:0%
conversation going
 
01:45:33.070 --> 01:45:33.080 align:start position:0%
forward thank you other
 
01:45:36.910 --> 01:45:36.920 align:start position:0%

committee services to get the print out
 
01:46:44.750 --> 01:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
for 619 so I don't know if we wanted to
 
01:46:46.350 --> 01:46:46.360 align:start position:0%
move to the Senate bill before we went
 
01:46:48.030 --> 01:46:48.040 align:start position:0%
did 69 okay that's
 
01:46:50.149 --> 01:46:50.159 align:start position:0%
fine there's no objection we'll we'll
 
01:46:52.910 --> 01:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
move to Senate Bill 236 and actually
 
01:46:54.709 --> 01:46:54.719 align:start position:0%
does do people have a copy of that
 
01:46:57.310 --> 01:46:57.320 align:start position:0%
Amendment the
 
01:46:57.320 --> 01:46:59.550 align:start position:0%
Amendment the
236

01:46:59.550 --> 01:46:59.560 align:start position:0%
236
 
01:47:01.790 --> 01:47:01.800 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if that was printed out
 
01:47:03.550 --> 01:47:03.560 align:start position:0%
maybe you want to get both amendments
 
01:47:05.910 --> 01:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
yeah I I'll see if that's up there okay
 
01:47:06.990 --> 01:47:07.000 align:start position:0%
do we know whose name that would be
 
01:47:09.669 --> 01:47:09.679 align:start position:0%
under M and representative Weber okay
 
01:47:12.070 --> 01:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
I'll go see if that's there and just for
 
01:47:14.550 --> 01:47:14.560 align:start position:0%
everybody's information all it did this
 
01:47:16.589 --> 01:47:16.599 align:start position:0%
was the bill that we actually voted on
 
01:47:19.830 --> 01:47:19.840 align:start position:0%
last time and then representative Murray
 
01:47:21.830 --> 01:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
actually read it and realized that the
 
01:47:25.589 --> 01:47:25.599 align:start position:0%
reporting date would have passed so um
 
01:47:28.390 --> 01:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
it just am it just amends the reporting
 
01:47:31.790 --> 01:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
date right representative Shapiro um I
 
01:47:33.350 --> 01:47:33.360 align:start position:0%
would like to request that when we get
 
01:47:37.350 --> 01:47:37.360 align:start position:0%
the amendment for 619 that we have a
 
01:47:39.189 --> 01:47:39.199 align:start position:0%
break of five minutes or so so that we
 
01:47:40.669 --> 01:47:40.679 align:start position:0%
can actually read through it carefully
 
01:47:42.870 --> 01:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
sure we can do
 
01:47:45.270 --> 01:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
that okay well uh we only have those two
 
01:47:47.149 --> 01:47:47.159 align:start position:0%
bills left so why don't we take a brief
 
01:47:48.750 --> 01:47:48.760 align:start position:0%
recess while we're we're waiting for the
 
01:47:50.910 --> 01:47:50.920 align:start position:0%
amendments to arrive and we'll basically
 
01:47:53.070 --> 01:47:53.080 align:start position:0%
extend the recess uh after we get the
 
01:47:55.629 --> 01:47:55.639 align:start position:0%
amendment so you can read them I think
 
01:47:58.030 --> 01:47:58.040 align:start position:0%

02:05:05.669 --> 02:05:05.679 align:start position:0%
to have another selection of members of
 
02:05:05.679 --> 02:05:06.629 align:start position:0%
to have another selection of members of
this

02:05:06.629 --> 02:05:06.639 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:05:09.830 --> 02:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
committee uh representative CL did you
 
02:05:13.229 --> 02:05:13.239 align:start position:0%
have something sorry my this was an ad
 
02:05:15.470 --> 02:05:15.480 align:start position:0%
hoc committee ad hoc subcommittee to
 
02:05:17.030 --> 02:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
continue what we've done on House Bill
 
02:05:20.069 --> 02:05:20.079 align:start position:0%
608 ad hoc it's it's not an ad hoc
 
02:05:21.390 --> 02:05:21.400 align:start position:0%
committee it's an interim study
 
02:05:23.149 --> 02:05:23.159 align:start position:0%
committee so it's now official we don't
 
02:05:25.589 --> 02:05:25.599 align:start position:0%
have to have both the interim study
 
02:05:28.589 --> 02:05:28.599 align:start position:0%
doesn't go to the house floor it it it
 
02:05:31.390 --> 02:05:31.400 align:start position:0%
will have to go to the house floor yes
 
02:05:34.709 --> 02:05:34.719 align:start position:0%
okay um can but can we have an ad hoc
 
02:05:35.990 --> 02:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
committee so that we're not waiting
 
02:05:39.030 --> 02:05:39.040 align:start position:0%
until January so that we can hear if we
 
02:05:42.109 --> 02:05:42.119 align:start position:0%
need to before December I don't I don't
 
02:05:44.430 --> 02:05:44.440 align:start position:0%
I mean you the chair can appoint
 
02:05:47.109 --> 02:05:47.119 align:start position:0%
anything he wants to appoint so there's
 
02:05:49.149 --> 02:05:49.159 align:start position:0%
no reason not to but I didn't see any
 
02:05:52.549 --> 02:05:52.559 align:start position:0%
reason to uh take it up again before
 
02:05:55.310 --> 02:05:55.320 align:start position:0%
January there is no house session before
 
02:05:57.669 --> 02:05:57.679 align:start position:0%
January correct um just in case there
 
02:05:59.830 --> 02:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
was a necessity to meet if there were
 
02:06:02.870 --> 02:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
any other changes to the process um
 
02:06:04.950 --> 02:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
whether things are going better or going
 
02:06:07.589 --> 02:06:07.599 align:start position:0%
worse with the direct billing and if
 
02:06:09.390 --> 02:06:09.400 align:start position:0%
there's any anything that would be
 
02:06:11.470 --> 02:06:11.480 align:start position:0%
helped by having us meet although you
 
02:06:13.870 --> 02:06:13.880 align:start position:0%
can name ad hoc committees even out of
 
02:06:15.910 --> 02:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
these meetings so I just wanted to make
 
02:06:18.229 --> 02:06:18.239 align:start position:0%
sure that we weren't uh missing anything
 
02:06:19.470 --> 02:06:19.480 align:start position:0%
minut it's far as the subcommittee
 
02:06:21.030 --> 02:06:21.040 align:start position:0%
meeting or the ad hoc committee meeting
 
02:06:22.709 --> 02:06:22.719 align:start position:0%
whatever term you want to use that I
 
02:06:24.030 --> 02:06:24.040 align:start position:0%
would leave that up to the discretion of
 
02:06:27.109 --> 02:06:27.119 align:start position:0%
the committee members and and yourself M
 
02:06:28.830 --> 02:06:28.840 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant yeah I'm not I
 
02:06:30.870 --> 02:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
didn't mean to ignore you no I I want to
 
02:06:33.629 --> 02:06:33.639 align:start position:0%
be clear about if it's
 
02:06:36.350 --> 02:06:36.360 align:start position:0%
a signed subcommittee of this committee
 
02:06:39.310 --> 02:06:39.320 align:start position:0%
then it has I believe look at the um
 
02:06:42.350 --> 02:06:42.360 align:start position:0%
researcher it has to go through notice
 
02:06:45.189 --> 02:06:45.199 align:start position:0%
and also public hearing if it's an ad
 
02:06:48.069 --> 02:06:48.079 align:start position:0%
hoc group it doesn't require notice in
 
02:06:49.549 --> 02:06:49.559 align:start position:0%
the calendar and I think you can also
 
02:06:51.149 --> 02:06:51.159 align:start position:0%
meet via
 
02:06:55.189 --> 02:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
Zoom no first of all no no subcommittee
 
02:06:58.030 --> 02:06:58.040 align:start position:0%
of this body can meet via Zoom because
 
02:06:59.390 --> 02:06:59.400 align:start position:0%
it's not in our
 
02:07:04.149 --> 02:07:04.159 align:start position:0%
rules even an ad hoc no there is no
 
02:07:06.470 --> 02:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
authorization and the only thing that
 
02:07:09.270 --> 02:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
speaks to it is Masons which says if
 
02:07:11.709 --> 02:07:11.719 align:start position:0%
there is no specific authorization you
 
02:07:14.510 --> 02:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
can't do it so that's where we
 
02:07:17.510 --> 02:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
are for this
 
02:07:17.520 --> 02:07:21.069 align:start position:0%
are for this
body

02:07:21.069 --> 02:07:21.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:23.510 --> 02:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
the house not the Senate the Senate has
 
02:07:23.520 --> 02:07:24.310 align:start position:0%
the house not the Senate the Senate has
different

02:07:24.310 --> 02:07:24.320 align:start position:0%
different
 
02:07:26.390 --> 02:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
rules so we
 
02:07:30.790 --> 02:07:30.800 align:start position:0%
can't okay and and yes any subcommittee
 
02:07:35.069 --> 02:07:35.079 align:start position:0%
of this committee is subject to RSA 91a
 
02:07:36.589 --> 02:07:36.599 align:start position:0%
so there has to be
 
02:07:39.149 --> 02:07:39.159 align:start position:0%
notice uh but there doesn't have to be a
 
02:07:41.310 --> 02:07:41.320 align:start position:0%
hearing it could be a public meeting
 
02:07:41.320 --> 02:07:42.149 align:start position:0%
hearing it could be a public meeting
where

02:07:42.149 --> 02:07:42.159 align:start position:0%
where
 
02:07:46.149 --> 02:07:46.159 align:start position:0%
people um go and it's not necessarily a
 
02:07:48.950 --> 02:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
hearing it could just be a work session
 
02:07:50.750 --> 02:07:50.760 align:start position:0%
it in fact a subcommittee could not have
 
02:07:52.470 --> 02:07:52.480 align:start position:0%
a hearing that's my
 
02:07:52.480 --> 02:07:54.589 align:start position:0%
a hearing that's my
understanding

02:07:54.589 --> 02:07:54.599 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
02:07:57.549 --> 02:07:57.559 align:start position:0%
so I guess I'm I'm trying to
 
02:08:00.270 --> 02:08:00.280 align:start position:0%
understand if we're having a work
 
02:08:06.470 --> 02:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:09.470 --> 02:08:09.480 align:start position:0%
session my concept would be it would be
 
02:08:13.270 --> 02:08:13.280 align:start position:0%
like any other interim study committee I
 
02:08:16.310 --> 02:08:16.320 align:start position:0%
have seen interim studies done by
 
02:08:19.069 --> 02:08:19.079 align:start position:0%
subcommittees that did nothing
 
02:08:21.030 --> 02:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
I have seen interim studies that have
 
02:08:23.069 --> 02:08:23.079 align:start position:0%
been worked on only by the full
 
02:08:25.709 --> 02:08:25.719 align:start position:0%
committee I have seen interim studies
 
02:08:28.030 --> 02:08:28.040 align:start position:0%
that have been worked by a very small
 
02:08:31.189 --> 02:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
subcommittee very intensively it depends
 
02:08:33.830 --> 02:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
on the bill but we can do any of those
 
02:08:37.229 --> 02:08:37.239 align:start position:0%
under the interm study rubric so I don't
 
02:08:39.790 --> 02:08:39.800 align:start position:0%
see why one needs unless there was some
 
02:08:42.270 --> 02:08:42.280 align:start position:0%
kind of emergency that came up in which
 
02:08:46.149 --> 02:08:46.159 align:start position:0%
case the chair could appoint an ad hoc
 
02:08:48.990 --> 02:08:49.000 align:start position:0%
committee to deal with it but
 
02:08:52.709 --> 02:08:52.719 align:start position:0%
following the House vote it's an interim
 
02:08:55.229 --> 02:08:55.239 align:start position:0%
study bill you appoint a subcommittee if
 
02:08:58.149 --> 02:08:58.159 align:start position:0%
that seems good to you which it has
 
02:09:01.109 --> 02:09:01.119 align:start position:0%
because you have and and we just go on
 
02:09:04.709 --> 02:09:04.719 align:start position:0%
as we were okay thank you representative
 
02:09:06.830 --> 02:09:06.840 align:start position:0%
Merchant does that answer your question
 
02:09:11.030 --> 02:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
or temporarily okay all right well let
 
02:09:14.669 --> 02:09:14.679 align:start position:0%
me know when you need a more permanent
 
02:09:14.679 --> 02:09:16.270 align:start position:0%
me know when you need a more permanent
answer

02:09:16.270 --> 02:09:16.280 align:start position:0%
answer
 
02:09:19.589 --> 02:09:19.599 align:start position:0%
um okay um
 
02:09:22.510 --> 02:09:22.520 align:start position:0%
so moving on from 608 uh next bill up
 
02:09:25.030 --> 02:09:25.040 align:start position:0%

you
 
02:10:21.510 --> 02:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
um so through the work of the
 
02:10:24.669 --> 02:10:24.679 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um on this bill we found
 
02:10:26.669 --> 02:10:26.679 align:start position:0%
some common ground um toward the
 
02:10:28.589 --> 02:10:28.599 align:start position:0%
beginning of the work session um where
 
02:10:30.790 --> 02:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
there was some agreement about um
 
02:10:33.750 --> 02:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
perhaps that the surgeries need a pause
 
02:10:35.430 --> 02:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
um towards the end of the work session
 
02:10:37.669 --> 02:10:37.679 align:start position:0%
it seemed that um opinions changed a
 
02:10:39.910 --> 02:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
little bit differently and we were not
 
02:10:43.950 --> 02:10:43.960 align:start position:0%
able to find consensus um however this
 
02:10:47.950 --> 02:10:47.960 align:start position:0%
amendment here is a result of that work
 
02:10:51.310 --> 02:10:51.320 align:start position:0%
um and it is it has chiseled the bill
 
02:10:54.870 --> 02:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
down greatly um you'll see on uh the
 
02:10:57.870 --> 02:10:57.880 align:start position:0%
first section is the statements of are
 
02:10:59.310 --> 02:10:59.320 align:start position:0%
the statements of
 
02:11:04.430 --> 02:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
purpose um second section on page
 
02:11:08.549 --> 02:11:08.559 align:start position:0%
two um are the well beginning on page
 
02:11:10.470 --> 02:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
two um are the
 
02:11:14.109 --> 02:11:14.119 align:start position:0%
definitions and then we come down and um
 
02:11:15.990 --> 02:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
we have the prohibition of genital
 
02:11:19.030 --> 02:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
gender reassignment surgery on minor
 
02:11:21.390 --> 02:11:21.400 align:start position:0%
um so these are specific to the
 
02:11:22.910 --> 02:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
reconstructive surgeries on the
 
02:11:24.549 --> 02:11:24.559 align:start position:0%
genitalia of
 
02:11:28.510 --> 02:11:28.520 align:start position:0%
minors um for gender reassignment
 
02:11:31.669 --> 02:11:31.679 align:start position:0%
purposes there are exemptions there um
 
02:11:36.549 --> 02:11:36.559 align:start position:0%
or it it it specifically um states that
 
02:11:39.589 --> 02:11:39.599 align:start position:0%
what are not prohibited are those um
 
02:11:41.910 --> 02:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
malformation malignancy injury or
 
02:11:43.470 --> 02:11:43.480 align:start position:0%
physical disease
 
02:11:46.189 --> 02:11:46.199 align:start position:0%
procedures um and male
 
02:11:49.229 --> 02:11:49.239 align:start position:0%
circumcision um so this would just bring
 
02:11:51.629 --> 02:11:51.639 align:start position:0%
House Bill 619 it replaces the entire
 
02:11:55.910 --> 02:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
text of that bill um and prohibits
 
02:11:59.750 --> 02:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
genital gender surgeries on any
 
02:12:01.790 --> 02:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
individuals under the years of 18 in the
 
02:12:03.589 --> 02:12:03.599 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire thank
 
02:12:06.790 --> 02:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
you okay other
 
02:12:13.709 --> 02:12:13.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:16.830 --> 02:12:16.840 align:start position:0%
Shapiro thank you Mr chairman um first I
 
02:12:18.950 --> 02:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
would like to um
 
02:12:22.910 --> 02:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
um voice my appreciation for um the
 
02:12:26.669 --> 02:12:26.679 align:start position:0%
chair representative Leon and for the um
 
02:12:28.910 --> 02:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
representative Leon kushman and mour who
 
02:12:33.069 --> 02:12:33.079 align:start position:0%
brought this amendment I think it
 
02:12:36.510 --> 02:12:36.520 align:start position:0%
um it it obviously it greatly narrowed
 
02:12:41.069 --> 02:12:41.079 align:start position:0%
the thrust of the bill um but also it
 
02:12:43.510 --> 02:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
was done with
 
02:12:46.390 --> 02:12:46.400 align:start position:0%
um a great deal of respect and I think
 
02:12:49.830 --> 02:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
it allowed us to have a a committee
 
02:12:53.750 --> 02:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
discussion which um was
 
02:12:55.830 --> 02:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
really you know people where people
 
02:12:58.069 --> 02:12:58.079 align:start position:0%
disagreed but it was respectful and
 
02:13:01.669 --> 02:13:01.679 align:start position:0%
nobody was um I don't know how to put it
 
02:13:04.790 --> 02:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
exactly but um being overtly
 
02:13:07.350 --> 02:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
discriminatory towards a group of people
 
02:13:10.189 --> 02:13:10.199 align:start position:0%
and so I I just want to voice my
 
02:13:13.549 --> 02:13:13.559 align:start position:0%
appreciation for that
 
02:13:20.109 --> 02:13:20.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:22.870 --> 02:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
I would say that I'm uncomfortable with
 
02:13:25.549 --> 02:13:25.559 align:start position:0%
what I see as kind of a slant in the
 
02:13:29.270 --> 02:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
Preamble or the purpose of the bill um
 
02:13:32.149 --> 02:13:32.159 align:start position:0%
specifically on page two where it talks
 
02:13:32.159 --> 02:13:34.629 align:start position:0%
specifically on page two where it talks
about

02:13:34.629 --> 02:13:34.639 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:13:37.790 --> 02:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
um adolescent genital gender
 
02:13:39.629 --> 02:13:39.639 align:start position:0%
reassignment surgery generally lacks
 
02:13:41.669 --> 02:13:41.679 align:start position:0%
both adequate information for informed
 
02:13:45.109 --> 02:13:45.119 align:start position:0%
consent well I you know I think that
 
02:13:47.430 --> 02:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
there are many medical um associations
 
02:13:50.069 --> 02:13:50.079 align:start position:0%
that would dis agree with that um but
 
02:13:53.709 --> 02:13:53.719 align:start position:0%
that wasn't put in here and then it goes
 
02:13:56.310 --> 02:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
on to say that it involves a high risk
 
02:13:59.149 --> 02:13:59.159 align:start position:0%
of coercion for parental consent when
 
02:14:00.629 --> 02:14:00.639 align:start position:0%
parents believe that they're faced with
 
02:14:02.750 --> 02:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
a choice between child committing
 
02:14:05.990 --> 02:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
suicide or consenting to their child's
 
02:14:08.069 --> 02:14:08.079 align:start position:0%
gender assignment surgeries I think
 
02:14:11.589 --> 02:14:11.599 align:start position:0%
we've heard a lot about
 
02:14:14.549 --> 02:14:14.559 align:start position:0%
um the problem with suicidality with
 
02:14:18.629 --> 02:14:18.639 align:start position:0%
people who have um um this kind of
 
02:14:22.350 --> 02:14:22.360 align:start position:0%
dysphoria um maybe that's overstated as
 
02:14:25.030 --> 02:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
well but I think this is just purely
 
02:14:27.109 --> 02:14:27.119 align:start position:0%
conjecture and without any data to
 
02:14:28.830 --> 02:14:28.840 align:start position:0%
support it that you know that parents
 
02:14:31.229 --> 02:14:31.239 align:start position:0%
are going along with I mean first of all
 
02:14:32.790 --> 02:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
the surgeries aren't happening in New
 
02:14:35.589 --> 02:14:35.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and second of all we it's just
 
02:14:37.390 --> 02:14:37.400 align:start position:0%
conjecture to say that their that
 
02:14:40.069 --> 02:14:40.079 align:start position:0%
parents are basically being blackmailed
 
02:14:43.629 --> 02:14:43.639 align:start position:0%
into agreeing to their kids getting care
 
02:14:45.390 --> 02:14:45.400 align:start position:0%
because they're being told by
 
02:14:46.669 --> 02:14:46.679 align:start position:0%
professionals that their kids are going
 
02:14:50.030 --> 02:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
to commit suicide otherwise was um so to
 
02:14:52.589 --> 02:14:52.599 align:start position:0%
me that that's a slant that I feel
 
02:14:52.599 --> 02:14:54.030 align:start position:0%
me that that's a slant that I feel
uncomfortable

02:14:54.030 --> 02:14:54.040 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable
 
02:14:57.830 --> 02:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
with regardless um I am going to vote
 
02:15:00.910 --> 02:15:00.920 align:start position:0%
against adopting the amendment I just
 
02:15:02.589 --> 02:15:02.599 align:start position:0%
think that we've heard over and over
 
02:15:05.470 --> 02:15:05.480 align:start position:0%
again that these surgeries are not done
 
02:15:08.589 --> 02:15:08.599 align:start position:0%
um that all care is done with the um
 
02:15:11.750 --> 02:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
participation and consent of parents and
 
02:15:14.510 --> 02:15:14.520 align:start position:0%
families and
 
02:15:18.229 --> 02:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
um so I can't understand why we are
 
02:15:22.109 --> 02:15:22.119 align:start position:0%
picking one group of people to limit
 
02:15:27.310 --> 02:15:27.320 align:start position:0%
care that um that is not happening and
 
02:15:30.950 --> 02:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
um because we're doing that um not only
 
02:15:34.589 --> 02:15:34.599 align:start position:0%
is it interfering with um the patient um
 
02:15:34.599 --> 02:15:36.669 align:start position:0%
is it interfering with um the patient um
physician

02:15:36.669 --> 02:15:36.679 align:start position:0%
physician
 
02:15:40.589 --> 02:15:40.599 align:start position:0%
um relationship and legislating medical
 
02:15:43.990 --> 02:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
care but it also feels discriminatory to
 
02:15:46.430 --> 02:15:46.440 align:start position:0%
me because we're picking this one group
 
02:15:48.790 --> 02:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
to set limitations on
 
02:15:51.470 --> 02:15:51.480 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to vote against it I think
 
02:15:54.390 --> 02:15:54.400 align:start position:0%
it was a good process talking about it
 
02:15:56.830 --> 02:15:56.840 align:start position:0%
I'm sure it will go on um but I'm going
 
02:16:00.109 --> 02:16:00.119 align:start position:0%
to vote against it representative Leon
 
02:16:01.910 --> 02:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
02:16:04.629 --> 02:16:04.639 align:start position:0%
for that representative Shapiro um when
 
02:16:06.149 --> 02:16:06.159 align:start position:0%
we had had the public hearing on the
 
02:16:08.310 --> 02:16:08.320 align:start position:0%
non- derain amendment uh Dartmouth
 
02:16:10.390 --> 02:16:10.400 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock had told us that the genital
 
02:16:12.629 --> 02:16:12.639 align:start position:0%
gender reassignment surgeries were well
 
02:16:15.390 --> 02:16:15.400 align:start position:0%
researched um unfortunately the data
 
02:16:17.270 --> 02:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
that were provided um did not provide
 
02:16:20.149 --> 02:16:20.159 align:start position:0%
any information about genital gender
 
02:16:21.990 --> 02:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
surgeries the information that was
 
02:16:25.390 --> 02:16:25.400 align:start position:0%
provided was for puberty blockers um in
 
02:16:27.510 --> 02:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
a search of the data and search of the
 
02:16:29.709 --> 02:16:29.719 align:start position:0%
evidence looking at clinical trials.gov
 
02:16:32.270 --> 02:16:32.280 align:start position:0%
looking at every s single repository I
 
02:16:34.070 --> 02:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
know of and I've researched a couple
 
02:16:36.709 --> 02:16:36.719 align:start position:0%
things um there are no data that show
 
02:16:39.270 --> 02:16:39.280 align:start position:0%
the safety or efficacy um I I could not
 
02:16:41.190 --> 02:16:41.200 align:start position:0%
find any studies that spoke to the
 
02:16:43.669 --> 02:16:43.679 align:start position:0%
genital gender reassignment surgeries
 
02:16:47.230 --> 02:16:47.240 align:start position:0%
and because there are no data um it yet
 
02:16:49.110 --> 02:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
there is is an overwhelming push to tell
 
02:16:51.349 --> 02:16:51.359 align:start position:0%
people that it is safe and effective
 
02:16:53.389 --> 02:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
without the actual clinical the clinical
 
02:16:54.910 --> 02:16:54.920 align:start position:0%
evidence and clinical studies in order
 
02:16:57.349 --> 02:16:57.359 align:start position:0%
to support that that's where I am highly
 
02:16:58.709 --> 02:16:58.719 align:start position:0%
concerned that it's hard to give
 
02:17:00.750 --> 02:17:00.760 align:start position:0%
informed consent if you don't know what
 
02:17:04.190 --> 02:17:04.200 align:start position:0%
the risks are um this is an area that is
 
02:17:06.389 --> 02:17:06.399 align:start position:0%
very emotional because it is so
 
02:17:08.270 --> 02:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
important to the core being of so many
 
02:17:11.629 --> 02:17:11.639 align:start position:0%
people um and that's why I'm very very
 
02:17:14.110 --> 02:17:14.120 align:start position:0%
concerned that having well-respected
 
02:17:16.429 --> 02:17:16.439 align:start position:0%
institutions state that it's well
 
02:17:18.389 --> 02:17:18.399 align:start position:0%
researched but
 
02:17:20.790 --> 02:17:20.800 align:start position:0%
being unable to provide that
 
02:17:23.750 --> 02:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
research really makes me concerned for
 
02:17:25.830 --> 02:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
the parents who simply hear well
 
02:17:28.830 --> 02:17:28.840 align:start position:0%
researched and go along with it even
 
02:17:31.469 --> 02:17:31.479 align:start position:0%
though that they're unable to provide it
 
02:17:33.270 --> 02:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
and then as far as speaking to the fact
 
02:17:34.750 --> 02:17:34.760 align:start position:0%
about whether or not it's happening in
 
02:17:37.150 --> 02:17:37.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um we were not able to get
 
02:17:38.950 --> 02:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
airm no that it was happening but when
 
02:17:41.469 --> 02:17:41.479 align:start position:0%
you look at Medical Practice especially
 
02:17:43.549 --> 02:17:43.559 align:start position:0%
areas of emerging Technologies and
 
02:17:46.709 --> 02:17:46.719 align:start position:0%
emerging therapies a lot of times if you
 
02:17:48.870 --> 02:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
hire in a doctor or a surgeon who's
 
02:17:50.709 --> 02:17:50.719 align:start position:0%
doing a procedure then suddenly that
 
02:17:53.030 --> 02:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
practice pops up around them um this is
 
02:17:55.309 --> 02:17:55.319 align:start position:0%
a growing area and we don't know if any
 
02:17:57.110 --> 02:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
of our hospitals are looking to move
 
02:18:00.190 --> 02:18:00.200 align:start position:0%
into that area um I'm very troubled
 
02:18:02.030 --> 02:18:02.040 align:start position:0%
about the lack of evidence and the lack
 
02:18:04.030 --> 02:18:04.040 align:start position:0%
of response with any data to support the
 
02:18:06.549 --> 02:18:06.559 align:start position:0%
safety of this and that's why I believe
 
02:18:08.990 --> 02:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
that until there are such data it's
 
02:18:10.589 --> 02:18:10.599 align:start position:0%
important to hold off and wait till the
 
02:18:13.950 --> 02:18:13.960 align:start position:0%
age of majority so that um just so that
 
02:18:15.709 --> 02:18:15.719 align:start position:0%
you can make that decision and legally
 
02:18:17.270 --> 02:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
you're not bringing anybody else into it
 
02:18:19.469 --> 02:18:19.479 align:start position:0%
as well well um I I don't know if you've
 
02:18:22.030 --> 02:18:22.040 align:start position:0%
heard the parents being told would you
 
02:18:24.629 --> 02:18:24.639 align:start position:0%
rather have a dead son or Alive daughter
 
02:18:27.910 --> 02:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
that I would do anything for my kids I I
 
02:18:29.709 --> 02:18:29.719 align:start position:0%
would do absolutely anything for my kids
 
02:18:31.709 --> 02:18:31.719 align:start position:0%
and hearing that phrase would have me do
 
02:18:34.190 --> 02:18:34.200 align:start position:0%
absolutely anything it I would do
 
02:18:36.589 --> 02:18:36.599 align:start position:0%
anything so it's that's the concern
 
02:18:37.830 --> 02:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
that's why it says a high- risk it
 
02:18:39.270 --> 02:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't say that the parents are being
 
02:18:41.790 --> 02:18:41.800 align:start position:0%
coerced but when you have language like
 
02:18:43.589 --> 02:18:43.599 align:start position:0%
that I mean I'm getting the emotional
 
02:18:46.070 --> 02:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
reaction now you know it's you protect
 
02:18:48.709 --> 02:18:48.719 align:start position:0%
your kids and and the parents believe
 
02:18:50.110 --> 02:18:50.120 align:start position:0%
that when they're told that it's well
 
02:18:52.190 --> 02:18:52.200 align:start position:0%
researched and they're told about the
 
02:18:54.190 --> 02:18:54.200 align:start position:0%
potential catastrophic risk of not
 
02:18:56.349 --> 02:18:56.359 align:start position:0%
having that surgery they may consent to
 
02:18:58.309 --> 02:18:58.319 align:start position:0%
doing it without doing as much
 
02:19:00.190 --> 02:19:00.200 align:start position:0%
background work as they would otherwise
 
02:19:02.589 --> 02:19:02.599 align:start position:0%
do and that's that's why there is the
 
02:19:05.030 --> 02:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
concern about just putting a pause
 
02:19:07.270 --> 02:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
saying let's wait until you're 18 it's
 
02:19:08.990 --> 02:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
not denying anybody the care and if it's
 
02:19:11.230 --> 02:19:11.240 align:start position:0%
not happening today then that's not
 
02:19:14.389 --> 02:19:14.399 align:start position:0%
stopping it either
 
02:19:17.509 --> 02:19:17.519 align:start position:0%
um and it's it's crazy that it's so hard
 
02:19:18.709 --> 02:19:18.719 align:start position:0%
to have a discussion about what the
 
02:19:21.190 --> 02:19:21.200 align:start position:0%
medical facts are and that's what really
 
02:19:22.750 --> 02:19:22.760 align:start position:0%
makes me feel that we need to have this
 
02:19:24.509 --> 02:19:24.519 align:start position:0%
pause because if you can't discuss the
 
02:19:26.110 --> 02:19:26.120 align:start position:0%
facts even in a hearing like this
 
02:19:28.429 --> 02:19:28.439 align:start position:0%
without being afraid of being called
 
02:19:30.830 --> 02:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
names how do you do that elsewhere how
 
02:19:32.309 --> 02:19:32.319 align:start position:0%
do you know what the outcomes are how do
 
02:19:34.389 --> 02:19:34.399 align:start position:0%
you know the risks so that's why I
 
02:19:37.190 --> 02:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
believe that this is uh in the public
 
02:19:40.509 --> 02:19:40.519 align:start position:0%
interest other discussion representative
 
02:19:43.790 --> 02:19:43.800 align:start position:0%
King thank you Mr chair I'd like to
 
02:19:45.429 --> 02:19:45.439 align:start position:0%
address one point that representative
 
02:19:47.469 --> 02:19:47.479 align:start position:0%
Shapiro made and that is it's not Happ
 
02:19:49.870 --> 02:19:49.880 align:start position:0%
happening here right now and I think the
 
02:19:51.950 --> 02:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
reason why it's not happening in here
 
02:19:53.630 --> 02:19:53.640 align:start position:0%
right now is because it hasn't happened
 
02:19:56.510 --> 02:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
for Millennia uh it would would have
 
02:19:59.190 --> 02:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
been unfathomable to do these types of
 
02:20:03.990 --> 02:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
things just a decade ago uh both parties
 
02:20:06.630 --> 02:20:06.640 align:start position:0%
I think would have even agreed just 10
 
02:20:09.750 --> 02:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
or 15 years ago that these types of
 
02:20:12.230 --> 02:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
elective surgeries would have been
 
02:20:14.030 --> 02:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
Unthinkable and I don't think I don't
 
02:20:15.110 --> 02:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
think you would have you would have been
 
02:20:16.670 --> 02:20:16.680 align:start position:0%
very hardpressed to find anybody that
 
02:20:18.070 --> 02:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
would have supported it
 
02:20:21.070 --> 02:20:21.080 align:start position:0%
what's changed in the last 10 years is
 
02:20:24.670 --> 02:20:24.680 align:start position:0%
the culture but truth and falsehoods
 
02:20:28.710 --> 02:20:28.720 align:start position:0%
have not changed and what this bill does
 
02:20:31.750 --> 02:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
is it does make a moral statement about
 
02:20:35.630 --> 02:20:35.640 align:start position:0%
right and wrong and uh I support the the
 
02:20:37.830 --> 02:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
original bill but the reason why I'm
 
02:20:40.030 --> 02:20:40.040 align:start position:0%
supporting this amendment is because
 
02:20:42.550 --> 02:20:42.560 align:start position:0%
while I agreed with every single part of
 
02:20:45.750 --> 02:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
the original bill um I did agree I did
 
02:20:47.870 --> 02:20:47.880 align:start position:0%
agree at least in part that
 
02:20:51.190 --> 02:20:51.200 align:start position:0%
um it was a little Broad in scope um so
 
02:20:52.870 --> 02:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
that's what I liked about this amendment
 
02:20:54.630 --> 02:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
was that it Narrows the scope a little
 
02:20:59.150 --> 02:20:59.160 align:start position:0%
bit but I would like to implore uh
 
02:21:01.830 --> 02:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
people to vote for the amendment because
 
02:21:04.630 --> 02:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
um this is a nice compromise and if the
 
02:21:06.230 --> 02:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
compromise doesn't pass I'll still be
 
02:21:10.150 --> 02:21:10.160 align:start position:0%
supporting the the uh the original the
 
02:21:12.750 --> 02:21:12.760 align:start position:0%
original bill because I do believe that
 
02:21:15.429 --> 02:21:15.439 align:start position:0%
this issue is so important it does need
 
02:21:17.590 --> 02:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
to be supported immediately before it
 
02:21:19.349 --> 02:21:19.359 align:start position:0%
does start happening in the state and
 
02:21:20.750 --> 02:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
once it starts happening then it's going
 
02:21:22.469 --> 02:21:22.479 align:start position:0%
to be even more difficult to stop so we
 
02:21:23.830 --> 02:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
need to nip it in the butt as far as I'm
 
02:21:26.550 --> 02:21:26.560 align:start position:0%
concerned thank you representative
 
02:21:29.429 --> 02:21:29.439 align:start position:0%
Canon thank you Mr
 
02:21:33.270 --> 02:21:33.280 align:start position:0%
chair um I circulated a document to you
 
02:21:36.030 --> 02:21:36.040 align:start position:0%
today U concerning the Harry Benjamin
 
02:21:37.910 --> 02:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
standards of care and you're GNA say
 
02:21:40.230 --> 02:21:40.240 align:start position:0%
well why is this being circulated uh
 
02:21:42.910 --> 02:21:42.920 align:start position:0%
Harry Benjamin was a doctor in the 1950s
 
02:21:44.910 --> 02:21:44.920 align:start position:0%
that was studying how to care for
 
02:21:48.309 --> 02:21:48.319 align:start position:0%
transexuals um he formed a um an
 
02:21:50.550 --> 02:21:50.560 align:start position:0%
association the Harry Benjamin
 
02:21:52.389 --> 02:21:52.399 align:start position:0%
International gender dysphoria
 
02:21:55.270 --> 02:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
Association and they produced the first
 
02:21:57.429 --> 02:21:57.439 align:start position:0%
document discussing the care of
 
02:22:02.590 --> 02:22:02.600 align:start position:0%
transexual individuals in in um
 
02:22:07.110 --> 02:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
1979 um so the uh the medical community
 
02:22:09.429 --> 02:22:09.439 align:start position:0%
has been aware of the need of for care
 
02:22:11.429 --> 02:22:11.439 align:start position:0%
for transgender transsexual and
 
02:22:14.110 --> 02:22:14.120 align:start position:0%
transgender individuals you'll note in
 
02:22:16.670 --> 02:22:16.680 align:start position:0%
the first paragraph it says that the uh
 
02:22:19.590 --> 02:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
uh the the document that they produce
 
02:22:21.910 --> 02:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
has been updated six times and the
 
02:22:24.309 --> 02:22:24.319 align:start position:0%
version of the document you have in
 
02:22:26.910 --> 02:22:26.920 align:start position:0%
front of you was dated
 
02:22:30.710 --> 02:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
2001 in 2007 the Harry Benjamin
 
02:22:32.510 --> 02:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
Association became the world
 
02:22:34.630 --> 02:22:34.640 align:start position:0%
Professional Association of transgender
 
02:22:36.910 --> 02:22:36.920 align:start position:0%
Health commonly referred to as
 
02:22:40.150 --> 02:22:40.160 align:start position:0%
wpath um they have continued to update
 
02:22:41.910 --> 02:22:41.920 align:start position:0%
the information associated with the care
 
02:22:44.309 --> 02:22:44.319 align:start position:0%
of transgender individuals and there
 
02:22:47.349 --> 02:22:47.359 align:start position:0%
whole and even in this document it in
 
02:22:49.150 --> 02:22:49.160 align:start position:0%
section five it has assessment and
 
02:22:51.630 --> 02:22:51.640 align:start position:0%
treatment of Children and adolescents
 
02:22:53.870 --> 02:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
they've improved this section over time
 
02:22:59.469 --> 02:22:59.479 align:start position:0%
but it does flag uh the uh the care of
 
02:23:01.429 --> 02:23:01.439 align:start position:0%
adolescents and making sure that people
 
02:23:04.950 --> 02:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
are that they're evaluated properly um
 
02:23:06.630 --> 02:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
from many different uh from many
 
02:23:09.750 --> 02:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
different angles as well as uh in here
 
02:23:12.429 --> 02:23:12.439 align:start position:0%
is to U provide information on making
 
02:23:15.670 --> 02:23:15.680 align:start position:0%
sure that people know what the results
 
02:23:19.070 --> 02:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
are going to be what what risks are um
 
02:23:23.070 --> 02:23:23.080 align:start position:0%
and this is back in 2001 on this in this
 
02:23:25.190 --> 02:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
document it has in been it has been
 
02:23:28.590 --> 02:23:28.600 align:start position:0%
improved over time um based on medical
 
02:23:30.990 --> 02:23:31.000 align:start position:0%
study information provided in the
 
02:23:33.790 --> 02:23:33.800 align:start position:0%
medical community they've updated it uh
 
02:23:35.630 --> 02:23:35.640 align:start position:0%
for procedures and the knowledge that's
 
02:23:37.910 --> 02:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
been gained in the medical community to
 
02:23:40.190 --> 02:23:40.200 align:start position:0%
provide proper care for transgender
 
02:23:43.910 --> 02:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
individuals young and old um I
 
02:23:47.550 --> 02:23:47.560 align:start position:0%
believe that the the current Amendment
 
02:23:50.030 --> 02:23:50.040 align:start position:0%
although it's it's a great effort to
 
02:23:53.710 --> 02:23:53.720 align:start position:0%
limit the the bill um and to recognize
 
02:23:56.550 --> 02:23:56.560 align:start position:0%
that um there is a need to protect our
 
02:23:58.670 --> 02:23:58.680 align:start position:0%
our young people I believe that the
 
02:24:01.349 --> 02:24:01.359 align:start position:0%
medical establishment in uh New
 
02:24:05.510 --> 02:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is policing itself uh I'm not
 
02:24:08.710 --> 02:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
sure why we have to enter into uh uh
 
02:24:11.030 --> 02:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
putting in statute what already exists
 
02:24:14.590 --> 02:24:14.600 align:start position:0%
in the medical community and um I'm also
 
02:24:16.550 --> 02:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
concerned that this this document
 
02:24:20.550 --> 02:24:20.560 align:start position:0%
although does a good job at at um uh
 
02:24:25.830 --> 02:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
defining defining things um is it could
 
02:24:29.110 --> 02:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
be subject to change as medical
 
02:24:32.230 --> 02:24:32.240 align:start position:0%
information is updated for care of
 
02:24:34.309 --> 02:24:34.319 align:start position:0%
transgender individuals and there's no
 
02:24:37.349 --> 02:24:37.359 align:start position:0%
mechanism defined in this document as to
 
02:24:40.150 --> 02:24:40.160 align:start position:0%
how when things are changed in in the
 
02:24:42.190 --> 02:24:42.200 align:start position:0%
medical information available how does
 
02:24:44.389 --> 02:24:44.399 align:start position:0%
it get changed within the statutes in
 
02:24:47.150 --> 02:24:47.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire how does it change and and
 
02:24:49.790 --> 02:24:49.800 align:start position:0%
it can't change as quickly as as the
 
02:24:51.590 --> 02:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
medical field can change that
 
02:24:54.349 --> 02:24:54.359 align:start position:0%
information because new statutes will
 
02:24:56.150 --> 02:24:56.160 align:start position:0%
have to be written to change this
 
02:24:58.830 --> 02:24:58.840 align:start position:0%
information as posted in our in New
 
02:25:01.389 --> 02:25:01.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so
 
02:25:06.070 --> 02:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
um I'm also concerned that as um
 
02:25:09.150 --> 02:25:09.160 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro has mentioned um
 
02:25:12.670 --> 02:25:12.680 align:start position:0%
I don't believe u that that this
 
02:25:15.070 --> 02:25:15.080 align:start position:0%
document is needed I believe that this
 
02:25:17.790 --> 02:25:17.800 align:start position:0%
document is in search of a problem and I
 
02:25:19.190 --> 02:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
don't believe there's a problem
 
02:25:22.750 --> 02:25:22.760 align:start position:0%
currently in New Hampshire um there may
 
02:25:26.910 --> 02:25:26.920 align:start position:0%
have been in not no information on uh on
 
02:25:31.309 --> 02:25:31.319 align:start position:0%
uh what if any U uh surgical procedures
 
02:25:33.630 --> 02:25:33.640 align:start position:0%
have been done in New Hampshire but the
 
02:25:35.990 --> 02:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
the members of the medical community and
 
02:25:38.110 --> 02:25:38.120 align:start position:0%
the members of the transgender Community
 
02:25:40.710 --> 02:25:40.720 align:start position:0%
have not indicated um that these
 
02:25:42.190 --> 02:25:42.200 align:start position:0%
procedures are being done in New
 
02:25:44.950 --> 02:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so um for that reason I'm
 
02:25:47.110 --> 02:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
going to vote against this amendment
 
02:25:50.429 --> 02:25:50.439 align:start position:0%
mment thank you representative
 
02:25:54.070 --> 02:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
Palmer so I also appreciate how this has
 
02:25:58.389 --> 02:25:58.399 align:start position:0%
been um cut down to a much simpler uh
 
02:26:02.670 --> 02:26:02.680 align:start position:0%
bill but I have um two concerns one is
 
02:26:06.389 --> 02:26:06.399 align:start position:0%
that you that uh different studies
 
02:26:12.269 --> 02:26:12.279 align:start position:0%
between 15 n 2015 and 22 are um
 
02:26:14.190 --> 02:26:14.200 align:start position:0%
mentioned in here and that would sort of
 
02:26:15.830 --> 02:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
mean that this is going to be con this
 
02:26:18.830 --> 02:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
would be constantly would have constant
 
02:26:21.710 --> 02:26:21.720 align:start position:0%
need for um revision which would be
 
02:26:24.269 --> 02:26:24.279 align:start position:0%
difficult to do in a statute because the
 
02:26:25.950 --> 02:26:25.960 align:start position:0%
the the data is going to
 
02:26:29.990 --> 02:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
change um but the bottom line is um from
 
02:26:31.790 --> 02:26:31.800 align:start position:0%
my point of view I just don't think that
 
02:26:33.830 --> 02:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
legislating Medical Care is a good idea
 
02:26:36.550 --> 02:26:36.560 align:start position:0%
I do agree that you know having any
 
02:26:38.830 --> 02:26:38.840 align:start position:0%
surgery or transgender care under the
 
02:26:40.990 --> 02:26:41.000 align:start position:0%
age of 18 is really
 
02:26:45.349 --> 02:26:45.359 align:start position:0%
problematic but and and you do elucidate
 
02:26:48.910 --> 02:26:48.920 align:start position:0%
areas in here that are um exceptions but
 
02:26:50.550 --> 02:26:50.560 align:start position:0%
you know are there exceptions that are
 
02:26:52.790 --> 02:26:52.800 align:start position:0%
not thought of and are we going to get
 
02:26:54.110 --> 02:26:54.120 align:start position:0%
into the same kind of trouble we have
 
02:26:56.389 --> 02:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
with other things where um a doctor's
 
02:26:58.070 --> 02:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
sitting there going like I need to make
 
02:26:59.710 --> 02:26:59.720 align:start position:0%
a decision but now I need to get the
 
02:27:01.469 --> 02:27:01.479 align:start position:0%
lawyers to tell me whether this decision
 
02:27:04.230 --> 02:27:04.240 align:start position:0%
is okay so the bottom line is I really
 
02:27:07.429 --> 02:27:07.439 align:start position:0%
can't um support this though I think the
 
02:27:10.510 --> 02:27:10.520 align:start position:0%
intent makes sense and I certainly think
 
02:27:14.110 --> 02:27:14.120 align:start position:0%
that waiting until people are adults to
 
02:27:15.950 --> 02:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
make these decisions is what should
 
02:27:18.830 --> 02:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
happen um but I also think that since
 
02:27:21.510 --> 02:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
it's not happening in New Hampshire and
 
02:27:24.429 --> 02:27:24.439 align:start position:0%
you know as you say it could and if it's
 
02:27:26.910 --> 02:27:26.920 align:start position:0%
abused then I think we need to look at
 
02:27:29.630 --> 02:27:29.640 align:start position:0%
the um State Board of Medicine to to get
 
02:27:32.590 --> 02:27:32.600 align:start position:0%
on it and then you can you know then
 
02:27:34.469 --> 02:27:34.479 align:start position:0%
then we can look at whether a law is
 
02:27:36.630 --> 02:27:36.640 align:start position:0%
needed representative Murphy and then
 
02:27:39.030 --> 02:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
representative Lon thank you Mr chairman
 
02:27:41.950 --> 02:27:41.960 align:start position:0%
um I I don't anticipate that anything I
 
02:27:43.389 --> 02:27:43.399 align:start position:0%
might say would change anybody's current
 
02:27:44.870 --> 02:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
opinion but I wanted to make a couple
 
02:27:46.990 --> 02:27:47.000 align:start position:0%
points that I saw in the amendment that
 
02:27:50.349 --> 02:27:50.359 align:start position:0%
I don't necessarily agree with um uh on
 
02:27:51.670 --> 02:27:51.680 align:start position:0%
the third page at the very bottom
 
02:27:53.150 --> 02:27:53.160 align:start position:0%
talking about enforcement I you know
 
02:27:56.349 --> 02:27:56.359 align:start position:0%
when somebody says referring somebody
 
02:27:59.190 --> 02:27:59.200 align:start position:0%
for surgery uh constitutes
 
02:28:01.710 --> 02:28:01.720 align:start position:0%
unprofessional conduct I I I think
 
02:28:03.910 --> 02:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
that's totally wrong you know if you
 
02:28:06.110 --> 02:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
refer somebody to a surgeon it's not the
 
02:28:07.910 --> 02:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
surgeon's responsibility to basically
 
02:28:09.469 --> 02:28:09.479 align:start position:0%
say okay I'll do it because I got a
 
02:28:11.309 --> 02:28:11.319 align:start position:0%
referral they have to make an assessment
 
02:28:13.590 --> 02:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
so I think that specifically referring
 
02:28:16.670 --> 02:28:16.680 align:start position:0%
to a surgeon to do a procedure in colge
 
02:28:19.630 --> 02:28:19.640 align:start position:0%
on that uh unprofessional it would be
 
02:28:21.830 --> 02:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
unprofessional if they did not refer
 
02:28:23.550 --> 02:28:23.560 align:start position:0%
when somebody had questions at least for
 
02:28:25.269 --> 02:28:25.279 align:start position:0%
evaluation so I'd make a point of
 
02:28:27.389 --> 02:28:27.399 align:start position:0%
contention with that I would also agree
 
02:28:29.230 --> 02:28:29.240 align:start position:0%
with representative Lyon I think the
 
02:28:32.670 --> 02:28:32.680 align:start position:0%
data in the research is there's aity of
 
02:28:35.389 --> 02:28:35.399 align:start position:0%
the data and it's difficult in medicine
 
02:28:38.870 --> 02:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
to extrapolate to um the general
 
02:28:41.190 --> 02:28:41.200 align:start position:0%
population as to what is best done for
 
02:28:43.510 --> 02:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
any individual patient without a lot of
 
02:28:46.870 --> 02:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
data um however having said that and and
 
02:28:48.870 --> 02:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
even regardless of the fact that if this
 
02:28:52.070 --> 02:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
is surgery is not done in New Hampshire
 
02:28:53.590 --> 02:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
what you are basically doing is two
 
02:28:55.150 --> 02:28:55.160 align:start position:0%
things you are legislating medicine
 
02:28:57.670 --> 02:28:57.680 align:start position:0%
which I am terribly against I I don't
 
02:29:00.469 --> 02:29:00.479 align:start position:0%
think that is appropriate but also you
 
02:29:02.950 --> 02:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
are putting on the books a statute that
 
02:29:04.790 --> 02:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
if and when that does become available
 
02:29:06.510 --> 02:29:06.520 align:start position:0%
whether it's at the tertiary Care
 
02:29:08.309 --> 02:29:08.319 align:start position:0%
Medical Center or wherever you are
 
02:29:11.630 --> 02:29:11.640 align:start position:0%
taking tools away from providers that
 
02:29:13.389 --> 02:29:13.399 align:start position:0%
would need to take care of the patient
 
02:29:17.110 --> 02:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
so I you know I understand the anx
 
02:29:19.389 --> 02:29:19.399 align:start position:0%
I have really thought very hard about
 
02:29:21.550 --> 02:29:21.560 align:start position:0%
this bill I've asked many people about
 
02:29:24.110 --> 02:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
the bill psychiatrist other patients
 
02:29:26.030 --> 02:29:26.040 align:start position:0%
constituents and I've come to realize
 
02:29:27.469 --> 02:29:27.479 align:start position:0%
that this bill is not necessarily
 
02:29:29.230 --> 02:29:29.240 align:start position:0%
falling down party lines but there are
 
02:29:31.230 --> 02:29:31.240 align:start position:0%
people that have very strong opinions
 
02:29:34.429 --> 02:29:34.439 align:start position:0%
about it for and against on both sides
 
02:29:37.230 --> 02:29:37.240 align:start position:0%
but I don't think a referral to any
 
02:29:39.670 --> 02:29:39.680 align:start position:0%
provider any other provider is a cause
 
02:29:41.910 --> 02:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
for unprofessional conduct I don't
 
02:29:43.190 --> 02:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
believe we should be legislating
 
02:29:45.510 --> 02:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
medicine like we don't we don't in other
 
02:29:47.510 --> 02:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
areas and and I I don't believe we
 
02:29:49.510 --> 02:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
should be taking away potential future
 
02:29:51.950 --> 02:29:51.960 align:start position:0%
tools in the toolbox for any provider
 
02:29:54.510 --> 02:29:54.520 align:start position:0%
that needs to take care of a patient so
 
02:29:57.349 --> 02:29:57.359 align:start position:0%
you know for those reasons even though
 
02:30:00.389 --> 02:30:00.399 align:start position:0%
the concept of vote for a u an amendment
 
02:30:01.950 --> 02:30:01.960 align:start position:0%
which I appreciate trying to narrow it
 
02:30:04.790 --> 02:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
down it still narrows it down to the one
 
02:30:07.110 --> 02:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
point of content contention where you
 
02:30:10.269 --> 02:30:10.279 align:start position:0%
are taking away the opportunity possibly
 
02:30:12.950 --> 02:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
for doing surgery and for that reason
 
02:30:14.710 --> 02:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
alone even though it is narrow D and I
 
02:30:17.110 --> 02:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
appreciate the effort the fact that it
 
02:30:20.309 --> 02:30:20.319 align:start position:0%
still is there to me regardless doesn't
 
02:30:22.550 --> 02:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
make a bad Bill better in my mind so I
 
02:30:24.070 --> 02:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
will vote against the amendment and
 
02:30:26.870 --> 02:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
probably the audit pass or with
 
02:30:29.510 --> 02:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment if that were to succeed thank
 
02:30:32.469 --> 02:30:32.479 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative Lon um
 
02:30:34.389 --> 02:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and I want to
 
02:30:36.269 --> 02:30:36.279 align:start position:0%
thank representative Palmer for bringing
 
02:30:38.950 --> 02:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
up the Board of Medicine just a week ago
 
02:30:41.950 --> 02:30:41.960 align:start position:0%
we were here discussing a bill intended
 
02:30:45.870 --> 02:30:45.880 align:start position:0%
to address the challenges around um
 
02:30:47.790 --> 02:30:47.800 align:start position:0%
essentially around cardiac surgeon who
 
02:30:50.590 --> 02:30:50.600 align:start position:0%
was implanting um implantable medical
 
02:30:52.469 --> 02:30:52.479 align:start position:0%
devices some of which I helped bring to
 
02:30:56.070 --> 02:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
Market um in a way that um caused harm
 
02:30:58.550 --> 02:30:58.560 align:start position:0%
to patients and death to patients there
 
02:31:02.309 --> 02:31:02.319 align:start position:0%
were very very solid protocols
 
02:31:05.030 --> 02:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
procedures and clinical evidence of the
 
02:31:07.429 --> 02:31:07.439 align:start position:0%
benefit and of the risks of those
 
02:31:10.150 --> 02:31:10.160 align:start position:0%
devices they were highly wellknown
 
02:31:14.070 --> 02:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
yet we still had people who died because
 
02:31:16.510 --> 02:31:16.520 align:start position:0%
in the practice of medicine those guid
 
02:31:20.710 --> 02:31:20.720 align:start position:0%
lines and those standards were not
 
02:31:24.590 --> 02:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
followed that is an was an area where
 
02:31:26.269 --> 02:31:26.279 align:start position:0%
there was so much information and they
 
02:31:28.469 --> 02:31:28.479 align:start position:0%
could have relied on a lot of different
 
02:31:30.870 --> 02:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
people from the device manufacturers
 
02:31:33.990 --> 02:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
from colleagues and from peers and there
 
02:31:37.950 --> 02:31:37.960 align:start position:0%
was what and the data was was very large
 
02:31:40.750 --> 02:31:40.760 align:start position:0%
and significant um when we look to I
 
02:31:42.510 --> 02:31:42.520 align:start position:0%
want to thank representative Canon for
 
02:31:45.710 --> 02:31:45.720 align:start position:0%
bringing this document um if you look to
 
02:31:47.309 --> 02:31:47.319 align:start position:0%
on the Harry Ben Benjamin standards of
 
02:31:49.429 --> 02:31:49.439 align:start position:0%
care if you look at the end of section
 
02:31:51.510 --> 02:31:51.520 align:start position:0%
five on the adolescence um it's just
 
02:31:53.870 --> 02:31:53.880 align:start position:0%
above the psychop therapy with with
 
02:31:56.510 --> 02:31:56.520 align:start position:0%
adults it's pretty close to the middle
 
02:31:58.309 --> 02:31:58.319 align:start position:0%
it speaks about in irreversible
 
02:32:01.110 --> 02:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
interventions in children it says any
 
02:32:02.830 --> 02:32:02.840 align:start position:0%
surgical intervention should not be
 
02:32:05.030 --> 02:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
carried out prior to adulthood or prior
 
02:32:08.389 --> 02:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
to a real life experience of two years
 
02:32:10.150 --> 02:32:10.160 align:start position:0%
um in the gender role of the sex at
 
02:32:12.630 --> 02:32:12.640 align:start position:0%
which the Adolescent identifies their
 
02:32:14.950 --> 02:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
threshold of 18 should be seen as an
 
02:32:16.870 --> 02:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
eligibility Criterion
 
02:32:19.349 --> 02:32:19.359 align:start position:0%
and not an indication itself for active
 
02:32:21.510 --> 02:32:21.520 align:start position:0%
intervention and then going to the
 
02:32:23.790 --> 02:32:23.800 align:start position:0%
second to uh third to last piece of
 
02:32:26.030 --> 02:32:26.040 align:start position:0%
paper on the genital surgery on section
 
02:32:29.110 --> 02:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
12 the eligibility criteria for genital
 
02:32:31.510 --> 02:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
surgery was legal age of majority in the
 
02:32:35.230 --> 02:32:35.240 align:start position:0%
patients Nation uh I I recognize that
 
02:32:38.469 --> 02:32:38.479 align:start position:0%
this moved to the 2007 um W path
 
02:32:39.950 --> 02:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
guidelines and even looking at the
 
02:32:42.830 --> 02:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
standard of care 8 from wath it speaks
 
02:32:45.349 --> 02:32:45.359 align:start position:0%
to respecting the legal age of majority
 
02:32:47.550 --> 02:32:47.560 align:start position:0%
and any laws surrounding this genital
 
02:32:51.030 --> 02:32:51.040 align:start position:0%
gender surgery um for these purposes and
 
02:32:53.349 --> 02:32:53.359 align:start position:0%
respecting those so that um the age of
 
02:32:56.269 --> 02:32:56.279 align:start position:0%
majority is considered in that clinical
 
02:32:58.269 --> 02:32:58.279 align:start position:0%
treatment we don't know how it's going
 
02:33:00.070 --> 02:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
to evolve next if there's a whole bunch
 
02:33:02.830 --> 02:33:02.840 align:start position:0%
of data and we're seeing we actually see
 
02:33:05.830 --> 02:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
outcomes and we actually see a benefit
 
02:33:08.750 --> 02:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
to it I really I this was such a hard
 
02:33:10.110 --> 02:33:10.120 align:start position:0%
thing to talk about I have a feeling
 
02:33:11.590 --> 02:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
that if the data shifts the other way
 
02:33:13.110 --> 02:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be a hard lift for
 
02:33:16.830 --> 02:33:16.840 align:start position:0%
this to be removed um but there is the
 
02:33:18.830 --> 02:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
memorializing of what the status is
 
02:33:21.150 --> 02:33:21.160 align:start position:0%
today that's why it doesn't say current
 
02:33:23.990 --> 02:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
studies show showed no decrease it says
 
02:33:27.750 --> 02:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
studies between 2015 and 2022 just as we
 
02:33:30.630 --> 02:33:30.640 align:start position:0%
talked about the 2006 data on sexual
 
02:33:33.110 --> 02:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
assaults now being out of date if this
 
02:33:35.670 --> 02:33:35.680 align:start position:0%
becomes out of date by including that
 
02:33:37.710 --> 02:33:37.720 align:start position:0%
language it gives a reason for it to be
 
02:33:41.269 --> 02:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
addressed in the future um I mean we we
 
02:33:44.830 --> 02:33:44.840 align:start position:0%
need to protect vulnerable people and I
 
02:33:47.030 --> 02:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
with the lack of data it's just very
 
02:33:48.830 --> 02:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
concerning and that's why I do see a
 
02:33:48.840 --> 02:33:50.469 align:start position:0%
concerning and that's why I do see a
role

02:33:50.469 --> 02:33:50.479 align:start position:0%
role
 
02:33:53.590 --> 02:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
here representative
 
02:33:57.349 --> 02:33:57.359 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you I agree with much of
 
02:34:00.269 --> 02:34:00.279 align:start position:0%
what's been said before um I have a
 
02:34:02.950 --> 02:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
couple of points um
 
02:34:05.950 --> 02:34:05.960 align:start position:0%
specifically uh to representative Leon's
 
02:34:08.710 --> 02:34:08.720 align:start position:0%
arguments which is that if we enact a
 
02:34:10.950 --> 02:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
Prohibition there will be no more
 
02:34:14.269 --> 02:34:14.279 align:start position:0%
data so there won't be anything to
 
02:34:17.150 --> 02:34:17.160 align:start position:0%
evolve there will be nothing to
 
02:34:23.190 --> 02:34:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:27.230 --> 02:34:27.240 align:start position:0%
seems like a self-fulfilling prophecy
 
02:34:31.590 --> 02:34:31.600 align:start position:0%
um I also just uh in thinking of whether
 
02:34:33.349 --> 02:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
to vote for this amendment I have the
 
02:34:34.830 --> 02:34:34.840 align:start position:0%
same concerns that have already been
 
02:34:38.469 --> 02:34:38.479 align:start position:0%
expressed I won't go over them again uh
 
02:34:41.110 --> 02:34:41.120 align:start position:0%
but you know there's always the question
 
02:34:42.990 --> 02:34:43.000 align:start position:0%
about do I do something that I think is
 
02:34:44.870 --> 02:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
better than the
 
02:34:49.429 --> 02:34:49.439 align:start position:0%
original and and um
 
02:34:52.750 --> 02:34:52.760 align:start position:0%
my the way I come down on this is that
 
02:34:55.469 --> 02:34:55.479 align:start position:0%
the folks with lived experience in this
 
02:34:59.550 --> 02:34:59.560 align:start position:0%
area have asked for this amendment not
 
02:35:02.429 --> 02:35:02.439 align:start position:0%
to be passed so uh that's what I'm going
 
02:35:05.910 --> 02:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
to vote for thank you repres
 
02:35:08.790 --> 02:35:08.800 align:start position:0%
Missour thank you Mr chair I've heard
 
02:35:12.510 --> 02:35:12.520 align:start position:0%
multiple times today that we are not
 
02:35:16.070 --> 02:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
doing this in New Hampshire and I was on
 
02:35:19.150 --> 02:35:19.160 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee that dug into this a
 
02:35:22.590 --> 02:35:22.600 align:start position:0%
little bit we reached out to Dartmouth
 
02:35:24.990 --> 02:35:25.000 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock and others did not receive a
 
02:35:27.950 --> 02:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
definite response but here is what we
 
02:35:31.070 --> 02:35:31.080 align:start position:0%
did find and this is right on Dartmouth
 
02:35:34.269 --> 02:35:34.279 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock's website we offer a wide
 
02:35:36.389 --> 02:35:36.399 align:start position:0%
variety of services for every stage of
 
02:35:37.630 --> 02:35:37.640 align:start position:0%
your journey
 
02:35:40.030 --> 02:35:40.040 align:start position:0%

02:35:55.590 --> 02:35:55.600 align:start position:0%
surgery gynecological Services that's on
 
02:35:58.670 --> 02:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Hitchcock this is on Elliot
 
02:36:01.030 --> 02:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
the plastic and reconstructive surgery
 
02:36:04.269 --> 02:36:04.279 align:start position:0%
team at Elliott Hospital are experts in
 
02:36:06.710 --> 02:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
gender affirming Top surgery to remove
 
02:36:09.710 --> 02:36:09.720 align:start position:0%
unwanted breast Tiss tissue or to create
 
02:36:12.510 --> 02:36:12.520 align:start position:0%
breast using
 
02:36:15.269 --> 02:36:15.279 align:start position:0%
implants it's very clear to me that this
 
02:36:17.349 --> 02:36:17.359 align:start position:0%
is being done in New Hampshire but yet
 
02:36:19.550 --> 02:36:19.560 align:start position:0%
we were told again and again that it
 
02:36:23.469 --> 02:36:23.479 align:start position:0%
wasn't so I have I'm
 
02:36:27.150 --> 02:36:27.160 align:start position:0%
now we need to do like go further and do
 
02:36:29.269 --> 02:36:29.279 align:start position:0%
an interim study on what's really
 
02:36:33.030 --> 02:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
happening in New Hampshire um because
 
02:36:35.389 --> 02:36:35.399 align:start position:0%
and and I said this in subcommittee but
 
02:36:37.349 --> 02:36:37.359 align:start position:0%
I want everybody to hear this this is
 
02:36:41.070 --> 02:36:41.080 align:start position:0%
not an attack on the lgbtq community
 
02:36:45.389 --> 02:36:45.399 align:start position:0%
this is taking one step in trying to
 
02:36:47.510 --> 02:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
protect the the children until they're
 
02:36:49.510 --> 02:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
adults and are able to make their
 
02:36:52.110 --> 02:36:52.120 align:start position:0%
decisions at that point that's what this
 
02:36:55.590 --> 02:36:55.600 align:start position:0%
is this is not an attack on anyone this
 
02:36:58.830 --> 02:36:58.840 align:start position:0%
is asking people to wait until
 
02:37:01.389 --> 02:37:01.399 align:start position:0%
children are adults and can make their
 
02:37:03.349 --> 02:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
own decisions what you do at that point
 
02:37:06.349 --> 02:37:06.359 align:start position:0%
is up to you but this is evidence that
 
02:37:08.710 --> 02:37:08.720 align:start position:0%
this is being done in New Hampshire so
 
02:37:11.389 --> 02:37:11.399 align:start position:0%
we need to take a state back step back
 
02:37:13.510 --> 02:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
and do more research and find out what's
 
02:37:13.520 --> 02:37:14.790 align:start position:0%
and do more research and find out what's
really

02:37:14.790 --> 02:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
really
 
02:37:14.800 --> 02:37:16.469 align:start position:0%
really
happening

02:37:16.469 --> 02:37:16.479 align:start position:0%
happening
 
02:37:18.389 --> 02:37:18.399 align:start position:0%
so can I would like to move to interim
 
02:37:18.399 --> 02:37:20.950 align:start position:0%
so can I would like to move to interim
study

02:37:20.950 --> 02:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:24.110 --> 02:37:24.120 align:start position:0%
please can I oh I'm sorry that and there
 
02:37:27.910 --> 02:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
are other people to sorry I'm getting
 
02:37:29.830 --> 02:37:29.840 align:start position:0%
um representative kushman do you have
 
02:37:32.150 --> 02:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
your hand up or yeah okay thank you Mr
 
02:37:32.160 --> 02:37:34.349 align:start position:0%
your hand up or yeah okay thank you Mr
chairman

02:37:34.349 --> 02:37:34.359 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
02:37:37.910 --> 02:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
um so yeah I would like to um continue
 
02:37:40.349 --> 02:37:40.359 align:start position:0%
on on kind of that train of thought
 
02:37:42.710 --> 02:37:42.720 align:start position:0%
again just bringing back to it's really
 
02:37:44.710 --> 02:37:44.720 align:start position:0%
members of the committee who keep saying
 
02:37:45.910 --> 02:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
that these aren't happening in New New
 
02:37:48.269 --> 02:37:48.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Dartmouth said that they are
 
02:37:50.469 --> 02:37:50.479 align:start position:0%
rare genital gender reassignment
 
02:37:52.429 --> 02:37:52.439 align:start position:0%
surgeries are rare and they actually
 
02:37:54.630 --> 02:37:54.640 align:start position:0%
answered one of my questions that um
 
02:37:56.309 --> 02:37:56.319 align:start position:0%
there may be circumstances where they
 
02:37:59.830 --> 02:37:59.840 align:start position:0%
need to be done and then I asked further
 
02:38:02.670 --> 02:38:02.680 align:start position:0%
can you tell me what the protocols are
 
02:38:04.870 --> 02:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
in deciding whether to go forward with a
 
02:38:07.630 --> 02:38:07.640 align:start position:0%
surgery on a minor or not um and they
 
02:38:09.830 --> 02:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
never uh supplied me with the policies
 
02:38:11.910 --> 02:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
and procedures which all medical
 
02:38:13.830 --> 02:38:13.840 align:start position:0%
facilities have down to how to do a
 
02:38:15.790 --> 02:38:15.800 align:start position:0%
catheter you should have a a procedure
 
02:38:17.630 --> 02:38:17.640 align:start position:0%
manual that explains that what the
 
02:38:20.070 --> 02:38:20.080 align:start position:0%
facilities procedures are um and they
 
02:38:22.309 --> 02:38:22.319 align:start position:0%
should be you know you grab it off of a
 
02:38:25.269 --> 02:38:25.279 align:start position:0%
desk um it should have been made
 
02:38:29.349 --> 02:38:29.359 align:start position:0%
available to us and um just circling
 
02:38:32.910 --> 02:38:32.920 align:start position:0%
back to um regulating Medical
 
02:38:36.389 --> 02:38:36.399 align:start position:0%
Care um I see a lot of picking and
 
02:38:39.469 --> 02:38:39.479 align:start position:0%
choosing um in this committee
 
02:38:42.469 --> 02:38:42.479 align:start position:0%
particularly um I brought a bill when
 
02:38:44.510 --> 02:38:44.520 align:start position:0%
people were dying and they needed
 
02:38:48.190 --> 02:38:48.200 align:start position:0%
something um other than remes severe um
 
02:38:50.510 --> 02:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
which was also killing people um they
 
02:38:52.990 --> 02:38:53.000 align:start position:0%
needed something and it could have been
 
02:38:54.670 --> 02:38:54.680 align:start position:0%
made available and there were Decades of
 
02:38:58.349 --> 02:38:58.359 align:start position:0%
re re uh Decades of research available
 
02:39:01.670 --> 02:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
showing it was safe and we just wanted
 
02:39:04.389 --> 02:39:04.399 align:start position:0%
to make PE make people have the option
 
02:39:07.510 --> 02:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
to have the choice to basically a right
 
02:39:11.349 --> 02:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
to try you know um and uh many people in
 
02:39:14.429 --> 02:39:14.439 align:start position:0%
this committee also voted against that
 
02:39:16.870 --> 02:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
and I think that you know that was an
 
02:39:18.710 --> 02:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity to step back and say well we
 
02:39:21.070 --> 02:39:21.080 align:start position:0%
don't want to regulate medic uh medicine
 
02:39:25.110 --> 02:39:25.120 align:start position:0%
but in that instance it was um and it
 
02:39:26.550 --> 02:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
was kept that way and something that
 
02:39:28.309 --> 02:39:28.319 align:start position:0%
could have helped people was not made
 
02:39:31.830 --> 02:39:31.840 align:start position:0%
available um we also require
 
02:39:35.670 --> 02:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
parents um to obtain certain kinds of
 
02:39:37.429 --> 02:39:37.439 align:start position:0%
medical care and I think that that is
 
02:39:39.750 --> 02:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
more of an overreach of the state than
 
02:39:42.870 --> 02:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
are requiring lenses who are in our
 
02:39:46.269 --> 02:39:46.279 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction um and are not just just
 
02:39:52.469 --> 02:39:52.479 align:start position:0%
the people um and and and to say that um
 
02:39:55.590 --> 02:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
you know trying to protect their rights
 
02:39:57.910 --> 02:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
and ensuring that they're not um
 
02:40:00.630 --> 02:40:00.640 align:start position:0%
especially children being becoming a
 
02:40:02.630 --> 02:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
victim of a short-sided decision that
 
02:40:06.309 --> 02:40:06.319 align:start position:0%
was maybe made with less information um
 
02:40:08.670 --> 02:40:08.680 align:start position:0%
than they needed at the time and without
 
02:40:08.680 --> 02:40:09.469 align:start position:0%
than they needed at the time and without
the

02:40:09.469 --> 02:40:09.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:40:09.479 --> 02:40:11.269 align:start position:0%
the
data

02:40:11.269 --> 02:40:11.279 align:start position:0%
data
 
02:40:14.309 --> 02:40:14.319 align:start position:0%
um I just think you know we we preclude
 
02:40:16.630 --> 02:40:16.640 align:start position:0%
uh vaginal births after cesarians if
 
02:40:18.070 --> 02:40:18.080 align:start position:0%
you've had two of them you don't you
 
02:40:20.630 --> 02:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
can't have Midwifery care there are many
 
02:40:23.790 --> 02:40:23.800 align:start position:0%
instances where we try to do things to
 
02:40:26.389 --> 02:40:26.399 align:start position:0%
protect the best interests of the public
 
02:40:29.790 --> 02:40:29.800 align:start position:0%
and this is one of those situations um I
 
02:40:31.830 --> 02:40:31.840 align:start position:0%
I respect that many people have these
 
02:40:35.309 --> 02:40:35.319 align:start position:0%
lived experiences and have have voiced
 
02:40:37.950 --> 02:40:37.960 align:start position:0%
their support for um allowing these
 
02:40:40.910 --> 02:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
surgeries for minors but there are many
 
02:40:43.910 --> 02:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
other voices telling us that they went
 
02:40:46.389 --> 02:40:46.399 align:start position:0%
through it and that the care was
 
02:40:48.710 --> 02:40:48.720 align:start position:0%
not as in um they didn't get the
 
02:40:51.030 --> 02:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
informed consent that they should have
 
02:40:53.269 --> 02:40:53.279 align:start position:0%
uh and that they didn't really know what
 
02:40:55.590 --> 02:40:55.600 align:start position:0%
the adverse effects were going to be for
 
02:40:57.269 --> 02:40:57.279 align:start position:0%
the rest of their lives that they now
 
02:40:59.469 --> 02:40:59.479 align:start position:0%
have to deal with um and they've been
 
02:41:02.389 --> 02:41:02.399 align:start position:0%
calling on us to do something to protect
 
02:41:05.630 --> 02:41:05.640 align:start position:0%
kids so I I think this is the proper
 
02:41:08.389 --> 02:41:08.399 align:start position:0%
place for us to step in and and as far
 
02:41:10.950 --> 02:41:10.960 align:start position:0%
as the medical establishment in this
 
02:41:14.309 --> 02:41:14.319 align:start position:0%
area policing themselves well against
 
02:41:17.030 --> 02:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
the W path guidelin which um you know
 
02:41:19.830 --> 02:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
say at least six months of therapy the
 
02:41:21.469 --> 02:41:21.479 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Coalition for gender
 
02:41:24.830 --> 02:41:24.840 align:start position:0%
diversity website offers a list of um
 
02:41:27.910 --> 02:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
resources for um kids who are struggling
 
02:41:30.150 --> 02:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
with gender issues and they offer
 
02:41:32.429 --> 02:41:32.439 align:start position:0%
contact kids and adults they offer
 
02:41:34.550 --> 02:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
contact info for psychotherapists who
 
02:41:36.630 --> 02:41:36.640 align:start position:0%
will write letters um recommending
 
02:41:38.510 --> 02:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
hormones and surgery after one to two
 
02:41:41.190 --> 02:41:41.200 align:start position:0%
visits that's that doesn't happen in six
 
02:41:43.630 --> 02:41:43.640 align:start position:0%
months um I mean I guess it could but I
 
02:41:45.830 --> 02:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't call that consistent care for
 
02:41:47.389 --> 02:41:47.399 align:start position:0%
that amount of time as the W paath
 
02:41:50.630 --> 02:41:50.640 align:start position:0%
standards call for so we brought these
 
02:41:52.670 --> 02:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
amendments forward with the w paath
 
02:41:56.510 --> 02:41:56.520 align:start position:0%
standards in mind and we found that they
 
02:41:58.349 --> 02:41:58.359 align:start position:0%
even though Dartmouth Hitchcock their
 
02:42:00.269 --> 02:42:00.279 align:start position:0%
website says that they follow those
 
02:42:02.870 --> 02:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
standards we've found a lot of holes in
 
02:42:05.070 --> 02:42:05.080 align:start position:0%
that and that doesn't seem to be holding
 
02:42:07.150 --> 02:42:07.160 align:start position:0%
up to be true and this is where the
 
02:42:09.230 --> 02:42:09.240 align:start position:0%
legislature needs to step in so thank
 
02:42:10.990 --> 02:42:11.000 align:start position:0%
you representative Canon you had your
 
02:42:13.070 --> 02:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
mic on for a while are you did you want
 
02:42:15.830 --> 02:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
to speak or yes I do okay go ahead um
 
02:42:17.269 --> 02:42:17.279 align:start position:0%
and then representative McKay and then
 
02:42:20.150 --> 02:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
representative veral there was a a qu
 
02:42:21.670 --> 02:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
there was a comment about Elliot
 
02:42:24.309 --> 02:42:24.319 align:start position:0%
Hospital um and providing surgicals
 
02:42:27.469 --> 02:42:27.479 align:start position:0%
surgical procedures for um people under
 
02:42:30.510 --> 02:42:30.520 align:start position:0%
the age of 18 I I know that I I've been
 
02:42:32.910 --> 02:42:32.920 align:start position:0%
contacted a number of times by U female
 
02:42:36.550 --> 02:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
to male people who have um have wanted
 
02:42:40.550 --> 02:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
surgery full masectomy and um denied
 
02:42:42.469 --> 02:42:42.479 align:start position:0%
that because they were under the age of
 
02:42:45.590 --> 02:42:45.600 align:start position:0%
18 and they needed a parental signature
 
02:42:47.630 --> 02:42:47.640 align:start position:0%
so they had to wait and couldn't they
 
02:42:49.550 --> 02:42:49.560 align:start position:0%
really struggled because they they
 
02:42:52.070 --> 02:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
wanted the surgery um but they had to
 
02:42:53.990 --> 02:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
wait until they were the age of 18
 
02:42:57.309 --> 02:42:57.319 align:start position:0%
because U Elliot wouldn't do the surgery
 
02:42:59.990 --> 02:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
procedures uh the the same thing has
 
02:43:03.469 --> 02:43:03.479 align:start position:0%
been true for for hormones um so I know
 
02:43:06.150 --> 02:43:06.160 align:start position:0%
in working with many families I I know
 
02:43:09.750 --> 02:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
that they their child has had to wait
 
02:43:09.760 --> 02:43:10.590 align:start position:0%
that they their child has had to wait
for

02:43:10.590 --> 02:43:10.600 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:43:14.750 --> 02:43:14.760 align:start position:0%
testosterone uh injections or for estr
 
02:43:21.309 --> 02:43:21.319 align:start position:0%
estrogen treatment um so so it it's been
 
02:43:23.990 --> 02:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
painful for a lot of transgender youth
 
02:43:25.269 --> 02:43:25.279 align:start position:0%
but they've had to adhere to the
 
02:43:27.110 --> 02:43:27.120 align:start position:0%
guidelines because their providers here
 
02:43:28.990 --> 02:43:29.000 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire have been
 
02:43:33.190 --> 02:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
holding true to what's in the W path
 
02:43:35.230 --> 02:43:35.240 align:start position:0%
recommendations and the
 
02:43:42.830 --> 02:43:42.840 align:start position:0%
DSM um and and so uh as I as I have read
 
02:43:45.349 --> 02:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
this document and I appreciate the
 
02:43:47.389 --> 02:43:47.399 align:start position:0%
pieces that are here I have to go back
 
02:43:51.590 --> 02:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
to why would we put medical information
 
02:43:55.190 --> 02:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
into statute when it it's being changed
 
02:43:59.670 --> 02:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
um and policing policing across the
 
02:44:03.630 --> 02:44:03.640 align:start position:0%
across the world uh to take care of our
 
02:44:06.590 --> 02:44:06.600 align:start position:0%
children as well as
 
02:44:09.190 --> 02:44:09.200 align:start position:0%
adults thank you representative McKay
 
02:44:11.389 --> 02:44:11.399 align:start position:0%
and then representative
 
02:44:13.710 --> 02:44:13.720 align:start position:0%
bville thank you Mr
 
02:44:16.790 --> 02:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
chairman uh I've been on this committee
 
02:44:20.190 --> 02:44:20.200 align:start position:0%
for many many years
 
02:44:24.230 --> 02:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that seems to keep
 
02:44:29.510 --> 02:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
coming back is our desire to teach
 
02:44:32.830 --> 02:44:32.840 align:start position:0%
doctors how to practice uh
 
02:44:38.630 --> 02:44:38.640 align:start position:0%
medicine uh over and over and over again
 
02:44:42.070 --> 02:44:42.080 align:start position:0%
uh my experience has been that the
 
02:44:45.349 --> 02:44:45.359 align:start position:0%
Physicians who are around this committee
 
02:44:49.510 --> 02:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
and have been do not support that
 
02:44:52.230 --> 02:44:52.240 align:start position:0%
approach and that
 
02:44:56.429 --> 02:44:56.439 align:start position:0%
they much more look into the kind of
 
02:44:59.990 --> 02:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
professional training that Physicians
 
02:45:02.349 --> 02:45:02.359 align:start position:0%
and surgeons and other
 
02:45:02.359 --> 02:45:04.429 align:start position:0%
and surgeons and other
Specialists

02:45:04.429 --> 02:45:04.439 align:start position:0%
Specialists
 
02:45:10.469 --> 02:45:10.479 align:start position:0%
um have uh so I am totally against
 
02:45:12.230 --> 02:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
legislation that
 
02:45:15.349 --> 02:45:15.359 align:start position:0%
tells uh Physicians and other Prof
 
02:45:19.309 --> 02:45:19.319 align:start position:0%
professionals how to practice uh their
 
02:45:23.750 --> 02:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
work uh I I think it's inappropriate I
 
02:45:29.030 --> 02:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
always have and I think uh uh I've I
 
02:45:30.230 --> 02:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
02:45:32.269 --> 02:45:32.279 align:start position:0%
recently uh how
 
02:45:36.230 --> 02:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
many of you have had the number of calls
 
02:45:41.110 --> 02:45:41.120 align:start position:0%
on 619 that I've had um partly because
 
02:45:44.110 --> 02:45:44.120 align:start position:0%
of conversion therapy which thank God
 
02:45:48.830 --> 02:45:48.840 align:start position:0%
didn't get uh put into this amendment uh
 
02:45:53.670 --> 02:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
but I am totally U uh in
 
02:45:59.550 --> 02:45:59.560 align:start position:0%
a in support of Physicians uh who feel
 
02:46:01.630 --> 02:46:01.640 align:start position:0%
that they get their training elsewhere
 
02:46:05.230 --> 02:46:05.240 align:start position:0%
and they should not be getting trained
 
02:46:07.910 --> 02:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
in any sense by the
 
02:46:10.630 --> 02:46:10.640 align:start position:0%
legislature thank you very much and I
 
02:46:12.830 --> 02:46:12.840 align:start position:0%
will speak against this thank you
 
02:46:14.510 --> 02:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
representative McKay representative
 
02:46:16.469 --> 02:46:16.479 align:start position:0%
verville and then representative
 
02:46:18.910 --> 02:46:18.920 align:start position:0%
Lon thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
02:46:21.630 --> 02:46:21.640 align:start position:0%
committee so um just two quick things
 
02:46:24.110 --> 02:46:24.120 align:start position:0%
one is is if this bill passes and
 
02:46:26.790 --> 02:46:26.800 align:start position:0%
becomes law it is not a self-fulfilling
 
02:46:29.910 --> 02:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
prophecy in in any form shape or manner
 
02:46:31.750 --> 02:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is a small state and we
 
02:46:33.830 --> 02:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
make up what approximately onethird of
 
02:46:36.150 --> 02:46:36.160 align:start position:0%
1% of the population of the United
 
02:46:39.070 --> 02:46:39.080 align:start position:0%
States we are one small state um perhaps
 
02:46:41.349 --> 02:46:41.359 align:start position:0%
choosing a different path than uh other
 
02:46:43.950 --> 02:46:43.960 align:start position:0%
states in the in the union this this is
 
02:46:45.870 --> 02:46:45.880 align:start position:0%
not a national bill we're talking about
 
02:46:48.910 --> 02:46:48.920 align:start position:0%
further we are we are one country uh on
 
02:46:51.150 --> 02:46:51.160 align:start position:0%
a global platform and and other
 
02:46:53.910 --> 02:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
countries will um support this this type
 
02:46:55.910 --> 02:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
of stuff and and other countries won't
 
02:46:57.710 --> 02:46:57.720 align:start position:0%
so so this is certainly not a
 
02:46:59.910 --> 02:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
self-fulfilling prophecy by by any
 
02:47:01.389 --> 02:47:01.399 align:start position:0%
stretch of the
 
02:47:04.550 --> 02:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
imagination the point that
 
02:47:07.070 --> 02:47:07.080 align:start position:0%
really brought my attention to to want
 
02:47:08.349 --> 02:47:08.359 align:start position:0%
to speak to
 
02:47:11.469 --> 02:47:11.479 align:start position:0%
you is that I reject the
 
02:47:16.910 --> 02:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
notion that we need to have some list of
 
02:47:19.429 --> 02:47:19.439 align:start position:0%
victims that have already been
 
02:47:21.950 --> 02:47:21.960 align:start position:0%
hurt before we pass
 
02:47:27.349 --> 02:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:30.309 --> 02:47:30.319 align:start position:0%
people this is proactive
 
02:47:33.070 --> 02:47:33.080 align:start position:0%
legislation to protect the most
 
02:47:35.870 --> 02:47:35.880 align:start position:0%
vulnerable among us and that is our
 
02:47:40.670 --> 02:47:40.680 align:start position:0%
minor children and to say or to suggest
 
02:47:41.670 --> 02:47:41.680 align:start position:0%
or to
 
02:47:45.429 --> 02:47:45.439 align:start position:0%
require that some number of victims
 
02:47:45.439 --> 02:47:46.590 align:start position:0%
require that some number of victims
be

02:47:46.590 --> 02:47:46.600 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:47:49.389 --> 02:47:49.399 align:start position:0%
generated before we take up such a
 
02:47:52.550 --> 02:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
matter for me is a bridge too far and
 
02:47:53.630 --> 02:47:53.640 align:start position:0%
for that
 
02:47:56.469 --> 02:47:56.479 align:start position:0%
reason I will support the
 
02:48:01.070 --> 02:48:01.080 align:start position:0%
amendment and I will support OTP or otpa
 
02:48:03.670 --> 02:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
whichever uh may may come and and those
 
02:48:05.349 --> 02:48:05.359 align:start position:0%
are the two points I just want you to
 
02:48:08.030 --> 02:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
give some serious consideration to as
 
02:48:09.750 --> 02:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
you uh as you weigh this on your own
 
02:48:12.550 --> 02:48:12.560 align:start position:0%
minds thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
02:48:15.150 --> 02:48:15.160 align:start position:0%
representative Lon um thank you Mr
 
02:48:17.269 --> 02:48:17.279 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you representative
 
02:48:19.590 --> 02:48:19.600 align:start position:0%
McKay for bringing up one section of our
 
02:48:21.269 --> 02:48:21.279 align:start position:0%
statutes where we do legislate the
 
02:48:23.590 --> 02:48:23.600 align:start position:0%
practice of medicine this amendment
 
02:48:26.590 --> 02:48:26.600 align:start position:0%
moved this protection for minor children
 
02:48:28.030 --> 02:48:28.040 align:start position:0%
regarding the genital gender
 
02:48:30.269 --> 02:48:30.279 align:start position:0%
reassignment surgeries to fall
 
02:48:33.469 --> 02:48:33.479 align:start position:0%
immediately after our prohibition on
 
02:48:36.190 --> 02:48:36.200 align:start position:0%
conversion therapy if we believe that
 
02:48:38.269 --> 02:48:38.279 align:start position:0%
doctors are following the guidelines and
 
02:48:42.030 --> 02:48:42.040 align:start position:0%
following best practices that statute is
 
02:48:44.550 --> 02:48:44.560 align:start position:0%
unnecessary however this committee did
 
02:48:47.670 --> 02:48:47.680 align:start position:0%
not not support repealing that law last
 
02:48:50.830 --> 02:48:50.840 align:start position:0%
year this committee took the position
 
02:48:52.790 --> 02:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
that there are times in which we
 
02:48:55.389 --> 02:48:55.399 align:start position:0%
legislate the practice of medicine and
 
02:48:58.150 --> 02:48:58.160 align:start position:0%
by refusing to update those statutes to
 
02:49:00.230 --> 02:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
better reflect more inclusive language
 
02:49:03.349 --> 02:49:03.359 align:start position:0%
to our n non-binary friends and to only
 
02:49:05.190 --> 02:49:05.200 align:start position:0%
have language that support people on a
 
02:49:08.630 --> 02:49:08.640 align:start position:0%
direct transitional path with one end
 
02:49:12.389 --> 02:49:12.399 align:start position:0%
point we continue to have a statute that
 
02:49:15.110 --> 02:49:15.120 align:start position:0%
legislates the practice of Medicine this
 
02:49:17.550 --> 02:49:17.560 align:start position:0%
would be adding another protection for
 
02:49:20.790 --> 02:49:20.800 align:start position:0%
minors and I have trouble seeing a
 
02:49:23.429 --> 02:49:23.439 align:start position:0%
consistency between supporting the
 
02:49:25.510 --> 02:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
prohibition on conversion therapy for
 
02:49:28.990 --> 02:49:29.000 align:start position:0%
minors and because and then opposing
 
02:49:31.110 --> 02:49:31.120 align:start position:0%
this under the GU that we do not
 
02:49:33.429 --> 02:49:33.439 align:start position:0%
legislate the practice of medicine if we
 
02:49:36.750 --> 02:49:36.760 align:start position:0%
can come to more broad Universal
 
02:49:39.590 --> 02:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
application of how we apply the laws
 
02:49:41.070 --> 02:49:41.080 align:start position:0%
then we can find a lot more agreement
 
02:49:44.269 --> 02:49:44.279 align:start position:0%
going forward but right now it is our
 
02:49:46.190 --> 02:49:46.200 align:start position:0%
practice to sometimes legislate the
 
02:49:48.830 --> 02:49:48.840 align:start position:0%
practice of medicine and I believe that
 
02:49:50.590 --> 02:49:50.600 align:start position:0%
as representative rille said we don't
 
02:49:53.510 --> 02:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
need to have a list of victims first to
 
02:49:58.990 --> 02:49:59.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:02.110 --> 02:50:02.120 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr
 
02:50:05.349 --> 02:50:05.359 align:start position:0%
chair I find it kind of ironic we talk
 
02:50:07.950 --> 02:50:07.960 align:start position:0%
about parents
 
02:50:11.030 --> 02:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
rights and the sacrament of the
 
02:50:13.150 --> 02:50:13.160 align:start position:0%
importance of parents and the ability
 
02:50:14.830 --> 02:50:14.840 align:start position:0%
for a parent to speak on behalf of for
 
02:50:14.840 --> 02:50:16.030 align:start position:0%
for a parent to speak on behalf of for
the

02:50:16.030 --> 02:50:16.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:50:18.990 --> 02:50:19.000 align:start position:0%
child it's been in our history for years
 
02:50:20.630 --> 02:50:20.640 align:start position:0%
it's been part of our civilization that
 
02:50:22.670 --> 02:50:22.680 align:start position:0%
parents are there take responsibility
 
02:50:23.990 --> 02:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
for their
 
02:50:26.670 --> 02:50:26.680 align:start position:0%
children and the state stays out of
 
02:50:30.349 --> 02:50:30.359 align:start position:0%
it we don't get into how the parent is
 
02:50:32.950 --> 02:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
trying to make judgments for their
 
02:50:36.429 --> 02:50:36.439 align:start position:0%
children yet here we are talking about
 
02:50:38.910 --> 02:50:38.920 align:start position:0%
getting involved with that area of
 
02:50:41.269 --> 02:50:41.279 align:start position:0%
parents and saying these are things you
 
02:50:43.030 --> 02:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
can't decide on because we're not going
 
02:50:45.389 --> 02:50:45.399 align:start position:0%
to let you do it so so I'm really
 
02:50:47.229 --> 02:50:47.239 align:start position:0%
wrestling with the issue of how do we
 
02:50:50.510 --> 02:50:50.520 align:start position:0%
somehow straddle that and saying parents
 
02:50:51.790 --> 02:50:51.800 align:start position:0%
have certain rights but parents don't
 
02:50:53.550 --> 02:50:53.560 align:start position:0%
have certain rights where does the state
 
02:50:56.349 --> 02:50:56.359 align:start position:0%
come down not just with Medical Practice
 
02:50:59.229 --> 02:50:59.239 align:start position:0%
of medicine but how we interfere with
 
02:51:01.269 --> 02:51:01.279 align:start position:0%
Parenthood and that's kind of one of the
 
02:51:03.670 --> 02:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
concerns I have here is that there's
 
02:51:06.030 --> 02:51:06.040 align:start position:0%
no place I think in some ways for the
 
02:51:08.070 --> 02:51:08.080 align:start position:0%
state to get involved with how parents
 
02:51:10.910 --> 02:51:10.920 align:start position:0%
take care of the children fundamentally
 
02:51:14.190 --> 02:51:14.200 align:start position:0%
number two when you start looking at the
 
02:51:15.750 --> 02:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
issue if you feel that there's going to
 
02:51:18.990 --> 02:51:19.000 align:start position:0%
be a question about the parents not
 
02:51:20.830 --> 02:51:20.840 align:start position:0%
speaking on behalf of their children
 
02:51:23.190 --> 02:51:23.200 align:start position:0%
correctly there's no vehicle in this
 
02:51:25.790 --> 02:51:25.800 align:start position:0%
amendment or in this bill that they
 
02:51:27.830 --> 02:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
could go to the court and have the court
 
02:51:30.190 --> 02:51:30.200 align:start position:0%
be sure that the child is not being
 
02:51:32.670 --> 02:51:32.680 align:start position:0%
cered the child is hearing what needs to
 
02:51:34.990 --> 02:51:35.000 align:start position:0%
be talked about the parents are fully
 
02:51:38.190 --> 02:51:38.200 align:start position:0%
informed on the consent there's some
 
02:51:40.550 --> 02:51:40.560 align:start position:0%
safety valve in the whole process to
 
02:51:42.309 --> 02:51:42.319 align:start position:0%
ensure that all parties are fully
 
02:51:44.910 --> 02:51:44.920 align:start position:0%
informed before it's done and the third
 
02:51:46.670 --> 02:51:46.680 align:start position:0%
thing about the enforcement we're
 
02:51:49.870 --> 02:51:49.880 align:start position:0%
dealing with the position here in the
 
02:51:51.630 --> 02:51:51.640 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire who makes a
 
02:51:53.830 --> 02:51:53.840 align:start position:0%
referral but we're not talking about the
 
02:51:55.790 --> 02:51:55.800 align:start position:0%
surgeon in another state who actually
 
02:51:58.510 --> 02:51:58.520 align:start position:0%
does the surgery and I go back to what
 
02:52:00.710 --> 02:52:00.720 align:start position:0%
president Linn said maybe we can't do
 
02:52:02.150 --> 02:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
that because we can't go across state
 
02:52:04.790 --> 02:52:04.800 align:start position:0%
lines but for those three fundamental
 
02:52:07.309 --> 02:52:07.319 align:start position:0%
issues I cannot support the underlying
 
02:52:10.150 --> 02:52:10.160 align:start position:0%
Amendment nor the underlying Bill thank
 
02:52:13.150 --> 02:52:13.160 align:start position:0%
you other
 
02:52:16.190 --> 02:52:16.200 align:start position:0%
discussion represent Senator bille thank
 
02:52:18.950 --> 02:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
you U Mr chairman
 
02:52:22.870 --> 02:52:22.880 align:start position:0%
so so while I fully appreciate and
 
02:52:26.190 --> 02:52:26.200 align:start position:0%
embrace parental rights in making uh
 
02:52:28.070 --> 02:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
decisions that they believe are in the
 
02:52:30.590 --> 02:52:30.600 align:start position:0%
best interest of their children the
 
02:52:32.590 --> 02:52:32.600 align:start position:0%
state does in fact get
 
02:52:35.790 --> 02:52:35.800 align:start position:0%
involved at a great number of different
 
02:52:39.910 --> 02:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
levels of what one may and what one may
 
02:52:45.510 --> 02:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
not do with or to their children so if I
 
02:52:47.670 --> 02:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
am starving in
 
02:52:50.349 --> 02:52:50.359 align:start position:0%
poverty and I have young
 
02:52:53.110 --> 02:52:53.120 align:start position:0%
children that if they could find a job
 
02:52:56.030 --> 02:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
could work to help feed the family under
 
02:52:59.349 --> 02:52:59.359 align:start position:0%
a certain age that is simply not allowed
 
02:53:02.269 --> 02:53:02.279 align:start position:0%
it is simply not allowed and while
 
02:53:04.070 --> 02:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
certain corporal
 
02:53:08.269 --> 02:53:08.279 align:start position:0%
punishment may be allowed certainly
 
02:53:10.429 --> 02:53:10.439 align:start position:0%
there's a threshold of corporal
 
02:53:13.030 --> 02:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
punishment which is not allowed by the
 
02:53:15.550 --> 02:53:15.560 align:start position:0%
state because it is deemed abusive
 
02:53:15.560 --> 02:53:17.150 align:start position:0%
state because it is deemed abusive
correctly

02:53:17.150 --> 02:53:17.160 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
02:53:20.469 --> 02:53:20.479 align:start position:0%
so so to say that well you know we're
 
02:53:22.790 --> 02:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
going to we're just going to support
 
02:53:25.590 --> 02:53:25.600 align:start position:0%
cart ban parental rights over the life
 
02:53:27.830 --> 02:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
of their children and we should keep the
 
02:53:31.349 --> 02:53:31.359 align:start position:0%
state out of it I agree it gets it gets
 
02:53:33.590 --> 02:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
flipped back and forth in each side of
 
02:53:35.670 --> 02:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
of a lot of issues like to to point to
 
02:53:38.630 --> 02:53:38.640 align:start position:0%
that but but there is no consistency
 
02:53:41.190 --> 02:53:41.200 align:start position:0%
there there is none and and for that
 
02:53:43.389 --> 02:53:43.399 align:start position:0%
reason I think to use it as a cart
 
02:53:46.429 --> 02:53:46.439 align:start position:0%
blanch sort of um reason to decide one
 
02:53:48.790 --> 02:53:48.800 align:start position:0%
way or another on a bill I I don't think
 
02:53:50.630 --> 02:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
it's applicable I think you have to
 
02:53:53.870 --> 02:53:53.880 align:start position:0%
weigh you have to weigh what it is that
 
02:53:57.710 --> 02:53:57.720 align:start position:0%
we're considering disallowing parents to
 
02:53:59.990 --> 02:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
have the authority to do over their
 
02:54:01.630 --> 02:54:01.640 align:start position:0%
children there are there are times and
 
02:54:04.590 --> 02:54:04.600 align:start position:0%
places where where disallowing that is
 
02:54:07.349 --> 02:54:07.359 align:start position:0%
valid and there are other places where
 
02:54:10.830 --> 02:54:10.840 align:start position:0%
uh full full allowance is applicable and
 
02:54:12.429 --> 02:54:12.439 align:start position:0%
so really that's a decision that you
 
02:54:14.429 --> 02:54:14.439 align:start position:0%
have to make in your heart and that's a
 
02:54:15.990 --> 02:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
decision you have to make in your mind
 
02:54:18.670 --> 02:54:18.680 align:start position:0%
but to look at State Statute and and how
 
02:54:20.229 --> 02:54:20.239 align:start position:0%
we deal with those things and say well
 
02:54:22.830 --> 02:54:22.840 align:start position:0%
that that guides me 100% I I don't think
 
02:54:26.030 --> 02:54:26.040 align:start position:0%
that that argument really um stands up
 
02:54:27.790 --> 02:54:27.800 align:start position:0%
at least respectfully at least for my
 
02:54:29.469 --> 02:54:29.479 align:start position:0%
for myself thank you Mr chairman thank
 
02:54:32.070 --> 02:54:32.080 align:start position:0%
you representative kushman thank you Mr
 
02:54:33.950 --> 02:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
chairman I just want to weigh and I'll
 
02:54:36.510 --> 02:54:36.520 align:start position:0%
be brief on the parental rights issue uh
 
02:54:38.590 --> 02:54:38.600 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't even address parents
 
02:54:42.670 --> 02:54:42.680 align:start position:0%
this bill um addresses Physicians uh
 
02:54:45.389 --> 02:54:45.399 align:start position:0%
that they are not uh uh they are not
 
02:54:47.950 --> 02:54:47.960 align:start position:0%
authorized to perform certain procedures
 
02:54:49.309 --> 02:54:49.319 align:start position:0%
uh physicians in New Hampshire are
 
02:54:51.870 --> 02:54:51.880 align:start position:0%
licensed entities they engage in a
 
02:54:54.630 --> 02:54:54.640 align:start position:0%
contract with the state they're granted
 
02:55:00.269 --> 02:55:00.279 align:start position:0%
certain privileges um and uh as they
 
02:55:02.630 --> 02:55:02.640 align:start position:0%
engage in that license they also have to
 
02:55:05.710 --> 02:55:05.720 align:start position:0%
follow the rules of that license
 
02:55:08.910 --> 02:55:08.920 align:start position:0%
um that is much different than applying
 
02:55:12.110 --> 02:55:12.120 align:start position:0%
rules to parents who have not contracted
 
02:55:13.750 --> 02:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
with the state and agreed to those rules
 
02:55:15.110 --> 02:55:15.120 align:start position:0%
other than
 
02:55:18.110 --> 02:55:18.120 align:start position:0%
uh giving their consent for their um
 
02:55:22.150 --> 02:55:22.160 align:start position:0%
duly elected officials to act on their
 
02:55:25.950 --> 02:55:25.960 align:start position:0%
behalf um it's less appropriate to put
 
02:55:28.510 --> 02:55:28.520 align:start position:0%
um restrictions on them but there are
 
02:55:32.229 --> 02:55:32.239 align:start position:0%
many and uh lastly Mr chairman I just
 
02:55:34.229 --> 02:55:34.239 align:start position:0%
wanted to mention
 
02:55:34.239 --> 02:55:36.870 align:start position:0%
wanted to mention
um

02:55:36.870 --> 02:55:36.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:55:36.880 --> 02:55:39.830 align:start position:0%
um
the

02:55:39.830 --> 02:55:39.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:55:43.030 --> 02:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
um the point that I forgot I'm sorry
 
02:55:44.950 --> 02:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
okay the
 
02:55:47.229 --> 02:55:47.239 align:start position:0%
discussion I'm seeing no other
 
02:55:49.429 --> 02:55:49.439 align:start position:0%
discussion all right I'll ask the clerk
 
02:55:51.710 --> 02:55:51.720 align:start position:0%
to call the roll the motion is out to
 
02:55:53.389 --> 02:55:53.399 align:start position:0%
pass on Amendment
 
02:55:58.389 --> 02:55:58.399 align:start position:0%

second okay would you like to speak to
 
02:57:11.550 --> 02:57:11.560 align:start position:0%
your motion representative king or has
 
02:57:14.070 --> 02:57:14.080 align:start position:0%
it all been said no thank you uh Mr
 
02:57:16.309 --> 02:57:16.319 align:start position:0%
chairman I would just like to uh
 
02:57:19.030 --> 02:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
reiterate that this is a um there is a
 
02:57:21.590 --> 02:57:21.600 align:start position:0%
moral stance being taken here um this
 
02:57:24.550 --> 02:57:24.560 align:start position:0%
isn't just technical um what we are
 
02:57:26.510 --> 02:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
saying effectively is that there is such
 
02:57:32.030 --> 02:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
a thing as right and wrong and um
 
02:57:34.990 --> 02:57:35.000 align:start position:0%
and what is not necessarily being done
 
02:57:36.469 --> 02:57:36.479 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire but what is being done
 
02:57:39.070 --> 02:57:39.080 align:start position:0%
to children around the country uh is
 
02:57:43.190 --> 02:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
wrong and I would just like to add that
 
02:57:45.950 --> 02:57:45.960 align:start position:0%
um you know children are unable to
 
02:57:48.229 --> 02:57:48.239 align:start position:0%
consent in this regard U we know how
 
02:57:50.190 --> 02:57:50.200 align:start position:0%
vulnerable and impressionable children
 
02:57:53.269 --> 02:57:53.279 align:start position:0%
are when it comes to just pure pressure
 
02:57:56.429 --> 02:57:56.439 align:start position:0%
but imagine when there is uh teacher
 
02:58:01.070 --> 02:58:01.080 align:start position:0%
pressure um Hollywood pressure um
 
02:58:02.750 --> 02:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
pressure from many different sides
 
02:58:06.670 --> 02:58:06.680 align:start position:0%
parental pressure to do something that
 
02:58:08.309 --> 02:58:08.319 align:start position:0%
these children are going to later grow
 
02:58:10.870 --> 02:58:10.880 align:start position:0%
up to absolutely regret and they're
 
02:58:13.269 --> 02:58:13.279 align:start position:0%
going to have a lot of resentment for
 
02:58:15.389 --> 02:58:15.399 align:start position:0%
really every body who pushed them into
 
02:58:18.190 --> 02:58:18.200 align:start position:0%
this and um I don't want to see that
 
02:58:19.630 --> 02:58:19.640 align:start position:0%
happen in New Hampshire so I'm doing
 
02:58:23.229 --> 02:58:23.239 align:start position:0%
what I can to stop that practice in New
 
02:58:25.590 --> 02:58:25.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we had an opportunity to make
 
02:58:28.389 --> 02:58:28.399 align:start position:0%
a compromise and to narrow the scope of
 
02:58:30.710 --> 02:58:30.720 align:start position:0%
the bill that compromise was not
 
02:58:33.349 --> 02:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
accepted as for the rest of the bill I
 
02:58:35.309 --> 02:58:35.319 align:start position:0%
supported the rest of the bill as well I
 
02:58:37.110 --> 02:58:37.120 align:start position:0%
think it's a great Bill my only
 
02:58:38.389 --> 02:58:38.399 align:start position:0%
contention is it would have been three
 
02:58:42.150 --> 02:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
bills but aside from that all of the all
 
02:58:45.030 --> 02:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
of the issues are Spott on and I support
 
02:58:47.550 --> 02:58:47.560 align:start position:0%
them and um thank you for your time Mr
 
02:58:51.790 --> 02:58:51.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:55.110 --> 02:58:55.120 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
02:58:59.110 --> 02:58:59.120 align:start position:0%
Canon um I have a problem with the HB
 
02:59:03.750 --> 02:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
619 in general um it's overall scope uh
 
02:59:06.590 --> 02:59:06.600 align:start position:0%
as uh representative King has flagged it
 
02:59:08.389 --> 02:59:08.399 align:start position:0%
those pieces should have been broken up
 
02:59:11.389 --> 02:59:11.399 align:start position:0%
into multiple pieces uh uh I have an
 
02:59:14.750 --> 02:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
issue especially um with with the focus
 
02:59:17.750 --> 02:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
on on uh transgender children especially
 
02:59:20.469 --> 02:59:20.479 align:start position:0%
in school and stuff we have focused in
 
02:59:23.030 --> 02:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
on a protected class of individuals and
 
02:59:25.950 --> 02:59:25.960 align:start position:0%
feel that this is a discriminatory Bill
 
02:59:28.710 --> 02:59:28.720 align:start position:0%
uh right to start off with but I also
 
02:59:31.469 --> 02:59:31.479 align:start position:0%
flag that the uh conversion therapy
 
02:59:33.510 --> 02:59:33.520 align:start position:0%
piece is not purely related to
 
02:59:35.469 --> 02:59:35.479 align:start position:0%
transgender individuals and we didn't
 
02:59:38.269 --> 02:59:38.279 align:start position:0%
address the uh gay and lesbian Community
 
02:59:42.630 --> 02:59:42.640 align:start position:0%
or or U non-binary folks uh so we we
 
02:59:45.190 --> 02:59:45.200 align:start position:0%
didn't get enough information from those
 
02:59:47.190 --> 02:59:47.200 align:start position:0%
from feedback from those individuals to
 
02:59:50.229 --> 02:59:50.239 align:start position:0%
make a decision of that part of the bill
 
02:59:53.469 --> 02:59:53.479 align:start position:0%
um I Al I I also feel that we've really
 
02:59:56.710 --> 02:59:56.720 align:start position:0%
um separated and and identified the uh
 
02:59:58.910 --> 02:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
transgender kids as being different than
 
03:00:01.389 --> 03:00:01.399 align:start position:0%
every other child in the school system
 
03:00:03.630 --> 03:00:03.640 align:start position:0%
um for that reason I I can't vote for
 
03:00:08.469 --> 03:00:08.479 align:start position:0%
this bill at all thank you other
 
03:00:10.750 --> 03:00:10.760 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
03:00:14.830 --> 03:00:14.840 align:start position:0%
palazov uh I support this bill uh as
 
03:00:18.710 --> 03:00:18.720 align:start position:0%
written uh I think that uh we need to
 
03:00:21.870 --> 03:00:21.880 align:start position:0%
return to science-based approach and
 
03:00:24.710 --> 03:00:24.720 align:start position:0%
suicide SS admitted in a suggestive
 
03:00:29.429 --> 03:00:29.439 align:start position:0%
survey is not equal to actual death uh
 
03:00:31.990 --> 03:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
we we we see that there's a lot of
 
03:00:36.510 --> 03:00:36.520 align:start position:0%
observational studies on benefit of uh
 
03:00:39.630 --> 03:00:39.640 align:start position:0%
those treatments but no relevant
 
03:00:42.710 --> 03:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
randomized control trials in child and
 
03:00:46.070 --> 03:00:46.080 align:start position:0%
adolesence on benefits of removing
 
03:00:49.190 --> 03:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
healthy organs or some other procedures
 
03:00:52.269 --> 03:00:52.279 align:start position:0%
that we are trying to address and I
 
03:00:54.389 --> 03:00:54.399 align:start position:0%
would even question if it's actual
 
03:00:57.870 --> 03:00:57.880 align:start position:0%
medicine when we remove healthy organs
 
03:01:02.510 --> 03:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
uh but uh uh New Hampshire as was said
 
03:01:05.510 --> 03:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
is not the only jurisdiction and some
 
03:01:09.750 --> 03:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
other liberal jurisdictions moved to a
 
03:01:13.309 --> 03:01:13.319 align:start position:0%
more cautious approach including friends
 
03:01:17.790 --> 03:01:17.800 align:start position:0%
they K Norway Sweden in Finland uh the
 
03:01:21.990 --> 03:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
comprehensive study found that uh this
 
03:01:25.469 --> 03:01:25.479 align:start position:0%
gender affirming care is associated with
 
03:01:27.990 --> 03:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
cardiovascular disease risk with
 
03:01:30.830 --> 03:01:30.840 align:start position:0%
osteoporosis with infertility with
 
03:01:33.590 --> 03:01:33.600 align:start position:0%
increased cancer risk and increased
 
03:01:36.950 --> 03:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
thrombosis risk so there are side
 
03:01:39.429 --> 03:01:39.439 align:start position:0%
effects to every medication so saying
 
03:01:42.790 --> 03:01:42.800 align:start position:0%
that of of label Medica by puberty
 
03:01:45.510 --> 03:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
blockus is absolutely safe it's false
 
03:01:46.630 --> 03:01:46.640 align:start position:0%
like every
 
03:01:49.229 --> 03:01:49.239 align:start position:0%
medication have side effects especially
 
03:01:53.910 --> 03:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
when we mess up with uh normal hormonal
 
03:01:57.110 --> 03:01:57.120 align:start position:0%
development of the Body for this reasons
 
03:02:00.510 --> 03:02:00.520 align:start position:0%
I support this Bill thank you thank you
 
03:02:02.990 --> 03:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
representative Canon um just as a
 
03:02:05.950 --> 03:02:05.960 align:start position:0%
reminder to people uh the uh House Bill
 
03:02:09.750 --> 03:02:09.760 align:start position:0%
619 wasn't just the surgical procedures
 
03:02:11.830 --> 03:02:11.840 align:start position:0%
um the original title of the bill was
 
03:02:13.590 --> 03:02:13.600 align:start position:0%
prohibiting gender transition procedure
 
03:02:15.389 --> 03:02:15.399 align:start position:0%
tees for minors relative to sex and
 
03:02:17.830 --> 03:02:17.840 align:start position:0%
gender in public schools and relative
 
03:02:20.190 --> 03:02:20.200 align:start position:0%
the de to the definition of conversion
 
03:02:22.510 --> 03:02:22.520 align:start position:0%
therapy so there's much more to House
 
03:02:25.590 --> 03:02:25.600 align:start position:0%
Bill 619 than just surgical procedures
 
03:02:28.309 --> 03:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
there was an a lot of information uh
 
03:02:31.469 --> 03:02:31.479 align:start position:0%
control of children in school and what
 
03:02:34.349 --> 03:02:34.359 align:start position:0%
they could and couldn't do um and uh the
 
03:02:37.590 --> 03:02:37.600 align:start position:0%
use of uh pronouns and a number of other
 
03:02:41.870 --> 03:02:41.880 align:start position:0%
things that were in 619 to control what
 
03:02:44.349 --> 03:02:44.359 align:start position:0%
transgender students could or couldn't
 
03:02:47.830 --> 03:02:47.840 align:start position:0%
do U so so this goes far beyond the
 
03:02:51.750 --> 03:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
conver the U TR the surgical procedures
 
03:02:55.990 --> 03:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
and U and again I will vote against it
 
03:02:58.469 --> 03:02:58.479 align:start position:0%
representative Lon um thank you Mr
 
03:03:00.990 --> 03:03:01.000 align:start position:0%
chairman um I recognize that this goes
 
03:03:02.710 --> 03:03:02.720 align:start position:0%
further than the amendment that we had
 
03:03:04.950 --> 03:03:04.960 align:start position:0%
worked on in good faith and that we
 
03:03:06.269 --> 03:03:06.279 align:start position:0%
thought that there was going to be a
 
03:03:08.550 --> 03:03:08.560 align:start position:0%
chance of coming together in agreement
 
03:03:10.990 --> 03:03:11.000 align:start position:0%
um now that hasn't happened and then
 
03:03:13.150 --> 03:03:13.160 align:start position:0%
it's split on party lines I think that
 
03:03:14.590 --> 03:03:14.600 align:start position:0%
we need to move this forward to the
 
03:03:16.469 --> 03:03:16.479 align:start position:0%
floor and that's why I'm supporting H to
 
03:03:18.670 --> 03:03:18.680 align:start position:0%
pass I wish it was as amended but I'll
 
03:03:20.590 --> 03:03:20.600 align:start position:0%
support H to pass so that we can move it
 
03:03:24.349 --> 03:03:24.359 align:start position:0%
to the floor other
 
03:03:26.910 --> 03:03:26.920 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none uh we'll move on
 
03:03:28.910 --> 03:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
to the vote I'll ask the clerk to call
 
03:03:32.469 --> 03:03:32.479 align:start position:0%
the r a motion is ought to pass on HB
