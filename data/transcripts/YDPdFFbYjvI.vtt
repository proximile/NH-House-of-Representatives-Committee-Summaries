00:14:48.389 --> 00:14:48.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:51.509 --> 00:14:51.519 align:start position:0%
neutral uh first of all for the record
 
00:14:55.069 --> 00:14:55.079 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chairman uh Chief Mark armaganian
 
00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
uh director of New Hampshire Liquor
 
00:14:59.470 --> 00:14:59.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement licensing uh with me here
 
00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
today is Deputy Chief Danielle ston
 
00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
deputy director of the same entity um we
 
00:15:09.749 --> 00:15:09.759 align:start position:0%
uh have been neutral on this uh piece of
 
00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
legislation due to the fact that we see
 
00:15:16.509 --> 00:15:16.519 align:start position:0%
both sides of the coin here um we
 
00:15:23.389 --> 00:15:23.399 align:start position:0%
see um uh from the leny perspective the
 
00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
possibility of uh Miniatures being in
 
00:15:29.389 --> 00:15:29.399 align:start position:0%
the bathrooms loading up drinks at the
 
00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:31.720 align:start position:0%
same time we see the negative effects of
 
00:15:35.509 --> 00:15:35.519 align:start position:0%
leaving a drink on a table and and the
 
00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:37.240 align:start position:0%
story that the representative shared
 
00:15:41.309 --> 00:15:41.319 align:start position:0%
with us uh which is horrific so um so
 
00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
with that being said uh I'll leave the
 
00:15:47.389 --> 00:15:47.399 align:start position:0%
technical pieces uh to Danielle here but
 
00:15:51.269 --> 00:15:51.279 align:start position:0%
uh from from the 10,000 foot level um
 
00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:00.189 --> 00:16:00.199 align:start position:0%
now okay any question anybody have
 
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
want to talk okay just stay right there
 
00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
all right so uh this is your build
 
00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
jar okay
 
00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
um should be sure
 
00:16:18.069 --> 00:16:18.079 align:start position:0%
kitchens uh areas
 
00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:21.160 align:start position:0%
now because we did allow last we passed
 
00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:22.600 align:start position:0%
another bill allows people to walk
 
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
around with their drinks anyways but
 
00:16:28.389 --> 00:16:28.399 align:start position:0%
they're not being served they're being
 
00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
served in so someone has to if they were
 
00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:34.440 align:start position:0%
in the hallway if the place was I can't
 
00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
say too crowded because there would be
 
00:16:39.749 --> 00:16:39.759 align:start position:0%
fire fire regulations but uh they they
 
00:16:41.189 --> 00:16:41.199 align:start position:0%
still have to come back to the bar to
 
00:16:43.309 --> 00:16:43.319 align:start position:0%
get their drink correct and and walk
 
00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:48.440 align:start position:0%
around um I guess the question I had was
 
00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:49.389 align:start position:0%
around um I guess the question I had was
here

00:16:49.389 --> 00:16:49.399 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:16:52.189 --> 00:16:52.199 align:start position:0%
was obviously the story you told was a
 
00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
very old story okay and I don't know how
 
00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
often this happens I I do remember the
 
00:16:59.550 --> 00:16:59.560 align:start position:0%
days when it did happen you
 
00:17:02.749 --> 00:17:02.759 align:start position:0%
then is oh by the way I did talk to a
 
00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
recent restaurant owner and he was
 
00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:07.640 align:start position:0%
talking about how the bathroom always
 
00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:09.720 align:start position:0%
seems he's empty the bag always seems to
 
00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:19.429 --> 00:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
right in the garbage yeah and yeah uh I
 
00:17:22.029 --> 00:17:22.039 align:start position:0%
have a family member who used to manage
 
00:17:25.029 --> 00:17:25.039 align:start position:0%
a restaurant and so when I talked to her
 
00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:27.640 align:start position:0%
if you remember the first was a 2023
 
00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:31.240 align:start position:0%
when we had that bill to help um it was
 
00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:33.240 align:start position:0%
we were passing that bill that would
 
00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
punish over serving remember that bill
 
00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:39.480 align:start position:0%
right um so I was speaking to her and
 
00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
she said that like you know sometimes
 
00:17:44.549 --> 00:17:44.559 align:start position:0%
they when they're emptying out the trash
 
00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:47.240 align:start position:0%
whereever they'll see drinks in there
 
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
and so um yeah I I think that that
 
00:17:53.029 --> 00:17:53.039 align:start position:0%
happens I think which I think kind of
 
00:17:54.909 --> 00:17:54.919 align:start position:0%
further proves the point that if we
 
00:17:57.789 --> 00:17:57.799 align:start position:0%
think that people people know that it's
 
00:17:59.590 --> 00:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
illegal to drink
 
00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:01.720 align:start position:0%
if you're under 21 and if people are
 
00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:04.120 align:start position:0%
going to break that law or people know
 
00:18:06.789 --> 00:18:06.799 align:start position:0%
that it's legal to bring alcohol into an
 
00:18:09.149 --> 00:18:09.159 align:start position:0%
establishment and then their drinks
 
00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:10.720 align:start position:0%
if you're going to break that law this
 
00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:12.440 align:start position:0%
isn't like preventing it from happening
 
00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:15.400 align:start position:0%
they're going to do it anyways right um
 
00:18:16.669 --> 00:18:16.679 align:start position:0%
and so particularly if you're bringing
 
00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
something from outside the
 
00:18:21.149 --> 00:18:21.159 align:start position:0%
establishment my main concern and the
 
00:18:22.669 --> 00:18:22.679 align:start position:0%
motivation for this obviously I share
 
00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
the story but it's I think for the most
 
00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:27.240 align:start position:0%
part people probably are taking I mean I
 
00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:29.960 align:start position:0%
didn't even know basically I worked in
 
00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:32.240 align:start position:0%
this role that this was illegal in New
 
00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:35.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I think most restaurants
 
00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
owners don't know I've spoken to some
 
00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:38.720 align:start position:0%
who were surprised to learn this so they
 
00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:40.600 align:start position:0%
didn't even know who was the thing but
 
00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:44.360 align:start position:0%
my point is is is what the motivation
 
00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:46.760 align:start position:0%
the motivation behind this law or me
 
00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:48.760 align:start position:0%
putting in this bill was when I actually
 
00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
saw a sign at a restaurant saying you
 
00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:53.000 align:start position:0%
can't do it because of alcohol some
 
00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:55.880 align:start position:0%
restaurant and so if that's H and if if
 
00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
that restaurant thinks it's in their
 
00:18:58.830 --> 00:18:58.840 align:start position:0%
best business interest to continue to
 
00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:00.280 align:start position:0%
prohibit it then they're welcome to do
 
00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:02.360 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't require them to they can
 
00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
go ahead and post that yeah they can
 
00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:05.960 align:start position:0%
still post that sign but uh to the
 
00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:08.320 align:start position:0%
extent that there are law abiding people
 
00:19:10.029 --> 00:19:10.039 align:start position:0%
which obviously people who bring alcohol
 
00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:12.360 align:start position:0%
into the restaurant are breaking the law
 
00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
already but to the extent there are
 
00:19:16.029 --> 00:19:16.039 align:start position:0%
people who will abide by laws and signs
 
00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
and things like that leaving a drink
 
00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
unattended exposes them to risk and
 
00:19:22.549 --> 00:19:22.559 align:start position:0%
that's that's sort of my whole argument
 
00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
so there are people who are already
 
00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
breaking laws going into bathrooms and
 
00:19:27.909 --> 00:19:27.919 align:start position:0%
drinking with alcohol that they didn't
 
00:19:29.029 --> 00:19:29.039 align:start position:0%
purchase there or giving giving it to
 
00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
minors whatever the concern may be those
 
00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
people are going to do it regardless of
 
00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
what this law is because this law is
 
00:19:35.669 --> 00:19:35.679 align:start position:0%
already in the books and it's already
 
00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
still happening but to the extent that
 
00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:39.640 align:start position:0%
people who are law-abiding leave out
 
00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:42.360 align:start position:0%
their drinks and and potentially expose
 
00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
themselves to danger or harm is just it
 
00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
just seems kind of pointless and um I
 
00:19:50.029 --> 00:19:50.039 align:start position:0%
feel like this isn't going to suddenly
 
00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
lead to a wave of people like oh sweet
 
00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
now that I can bring alcohol into the
 
00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
into the bathroom I can start spiking
 
00:19:57.549 --> 00:19:57.559 align:start position:0%
all my drinks where I couldn't before I
 
00:19:58.870 --> 00:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
mean if they wanted to do that they're
 
00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
do that now so I I just don't see that
 
00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
this is going to open up a door to a
 
00:20:04.149 --> 00:20:04.159 align:start position:0%
bunch of illegal activity that currently
 
00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:05.320 align:start position:0%
people where people are currently
 
00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
abiding by the law that's my thinking on
 
00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
it um so in terms of enforcement how
 
00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:15.720 align:start position:0%
often have you you guys have enforcement
 
00:20:19.149 --> 00:20:19.159 align:start position:0%
issues around U people taking their
 
00:20:20.549 --> 00:20:20.559 align:start position:0%
currently on the current law taking
 
00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
drinks into the bathroom I mean we do we
 
00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
do have we we do encounter situations
 
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
where we find drinks in the restroom
 
00:20:32.789 --> 00:20:32.799 align:start position:0%
um the way that we have um applied the
 
00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:34.360 align:start position:0%
enforcement to this in the past is that
 
00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
the lensey has mitigating factors in
 
00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:38.280 align:start position:0%
place they have signage the staff is
 
00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
regularly checking the restroom the
 
00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
restroom is clean the restroom safe um
 
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
we understand that you know even if you
 
00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
leave a a drink out as the
 
00:20:49.149 --> 00:20:49.159 align:start position:0%
representative said there's there's
 
00:20:50.909 --> 00:20:50.919 align:start position:0%
stuff to come in so this isn't something
 
00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:54.760 align:start position:0%
we heavily enforce um right now again we
 
00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
we want to see it we want it clean we
 
00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
want it safe we want it monitored you
 
00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
know anytime you can post signage or or
 
00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
inform the the public of what the the
 
00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:04.720 align:start position:0%
rules are that's to the benefit of the
 
00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:06.470 align:start position:0%
rules are that's to the benefit of the
ly

00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
ly
 
00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
okay uh I'll let Chris because he says I
 
00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:13.240 align:start position:0%
never recognize him yes representative
 
00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
Herbert I'm gonna bring a flag so you
 
00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:19.000 align:start position:0%
emergency um I have a my observation is
 
00:21:21.669 --> 00:21:21.679 align:start position:0%
unless I'm I'm misunderstanding the this
 
00:21:21.679 --> 00:21:22.430 align:start position:0%
unless I'm I'm misunderstanding the this
uh

00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:22.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
Bill uh I'm I'm 75 years old and I've
 
00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
been a drinker for a long time and I
 
00:21:31.549 --> 00:21:31.559 align:start position:0%
have I have never seen
 
00:21:34.669 --> 00:21:34.679 align:start position:0%
anybody take booze into the restroom uh
 
00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
I've never seen it I mean maybe it
 
00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:40.840 align:start position:0%
happens but um I know I've never done it
 
00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
and I don't see any reason why you would
 
00:21:48.029 --> 00:21:48.039 align:start position:0%
do that but uh it's to me it's I mean I
 
00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:49.480 align:start position:0%
I will take a beer with me into the
 
00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
bathroom if I'm walking in there I mean
 
00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:52.520 align:start position:0%
I don't
 
00:21:55.269 --> 00:21:55.279 align:start position:0%
know it's so because you haven't seen it
 
00:21:56.909 --> 00:21:56.919 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean other people maybe don't
 
00:21:58.630 --> 00:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
want to do that you know are you are you
 
00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:01.640 align:start position:0%
for or against this bill I'm against it
 
00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
okay because you don't see there's any
 
00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:05.200 align:start position:0%
need and that it's perfectly fine to
 
00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
make it keep it illegal is that
 
00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:11.000 align:start position:0%
correct you you don't even see reason to
 
00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
change the law that makes it illegal to
 
00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
take your drink into into the restroom
 
00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:19.000 align:start position:0%
no I I don't I think it's a non-event
 
00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:21.440 align:start position:0%
anyway but uh well it may it may be
 
00:22:23.549 --> 00:22:23.559 align:start position:0%
happening but uh I'm not I'm not aware
 
00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:26.480 align:start position:0%
of it and do you do you understand do
 
00:22:29.269 --> 00:22:29.279 align:start position:0%
you understand that it's not necessarily
 
00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
that I'm trying to encourage people to
 
00:22:33.029 --> 00:22:33.039 align:start position:0%
take their drinks into the bathroom like
 
00:22:35.269 --> 00:22:35.279 align:start position:0%
that's not my goal of this bill all I'm
 
00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:37.480 align:start position:0%
saying is if somebody thinks it's in
 
00:22:39.669 --> 00:22:39.679 align:start position:0%
their best interest to take a drink into
 
00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:41.480 align:start position:0%
the bathroom because they have no
 
00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
friends or they're waiting for somebody
 
00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:44.120 align:start position:0%
at a bar and if they leave it there it
 
00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
exposes it to potentially being spiked
 
00:22:50.909 --> 00:22:50.919 align:start position:0%
that is is my concern and so that's the
 
00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
motivation of the bill I'm not trying to
 
00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:53.440 align:start position:0%
say hey everybody bring your drinks into
 
00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
the bathroom that's the fun place to
 
00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:56.240 align:start position:0%
drink in the bar like that's that's
 
00:22:59.310 --> 00:22:59.320 align:start position:0%
insane I'm not doing that
 
00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:03.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:06.029 --> 00:23:06.039 align:start position:0%
Barz okay I'm I'm a sponsor of this bill
 
00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:08.120 align:start position:0%
and I support it I just want to make two
 
00:23:10.269 --> 00:23:10.279 align:start position:0%
points one is you know we you were
 
00:23:12.269 --> 00:23:12.279 align:start position:0%
saying that you haven't had had any
 
00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:14.320 align:start position:0%
recent examples there's one that big in
 
00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
the news it's not in New Hampshire um
 
00:23:17.789 --> 00:23:17.799 align:start position:0%
You probably read about these three
 
00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
Realtors who were you know top realtors
 
00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:23.400 align:start position:0%
were drugging women um spiking their
 
00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:26.600 align:start position:0%
drinks one of them was on um million
 
00:23:29.789 --> 00:23:29.799 align:start position:0%
doll listing the the the um the realtor
 
00:23:32.029 --> 00:23:32.039 align:start position:0%
and she was found in a bathroom being
 
00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:33.880 align:start position:0%
assaulted and another realtor pulled
 
00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
them off and they are probably going to
 
00:23:37.549 --> 00:23:37.559 align:start position:0%
go to jail for life but you know if
 
00:23:39.789 --> 00:23:39.799 align:start position:0%
there is push back on this bill I mean I
 
00:23:42.149 --> 00:23:42.159 align:start position:0%
thought of another possible solution
 
00:23:45.669 --> 00:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
which would be do voluntarily for for
 
00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
bars to have a place behind the bar
 
00:23:49.789 --> 00:23:49.799 align:start position:0%
where women can leave or anybody could
 
00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
leave their drinks and maybe you know a
 
00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:54.760 align:start position:0%
tag to put their name on
 
00:23:58.430 --> 00:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
it a safe zone right we we do have
 
00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:01.400 align:start position:0%
several establishments who have um put
 
00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:07.400 align:start position:0%
in practices for um for for variety of
 
00:24:09.549 --> 00:24:09.559 align:start position:0%
different things um they sell covers to
 
00:24:10.909 --> 00:24:10.919 align:start position:0%
your drinks that you can put on your
 
00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
drinks there's um there's apps that you
 
00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:15.240 align:start position:0%
can actually use now where you can show
 
00:24:17.029 --> 00:24:17.039 align:start position:0%
the bartender and say you know can you
 
00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
make me this drink and it means certain
 
00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:20.720 align:start position:0%
things that I need help or can you get
 
00:24:22.549 --> 00:24:22.559 align:start position:0%
me out of the situation so we do see
 
00:24:24.149 --> 00:24:24.159 align:start position:0%
that throughout the state where there's
 
00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
options or they put in safe practices um
 
00:24:27.789 --> 00:24:27.799 align:start position:0%
to make the customers feel more
 
00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:29.960 align:start position:0%
comfortable and again in terms of the
 
00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:32.200 align:start position:0%
lensey they can take any law on the
 
00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
street and restrict it to within their
 
00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:37.480 align:start position:0%
business practices to whatever they feel
 
00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:39.240 align:start position:0%
they need to do to have a successful run
 
00:24:41.149 --> 00:24:41.159 align:start position:0%
business so the lenses would still be
 
00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
able to prohibit drinks in the restroom
 
00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
if they chose to do that and and that's
 
00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
just a business practice that they can
 
00:24:51.389 --> 00:24:51.399 align:start position:0%
enact okay uh
 
00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
Henry I don't see Mike here are you
 
00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:03.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
I guess the question would be is this is
 
00:25:08.389 --> 00:25:08.399 align:start position:0%
one of those classic uh with the
 
00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:10.440 align:start position:0%
restaurants want us to keep it simply
 
00:25:11.789 --> 00:25:11.799 align:start position:0%
because they don't want to be the
 
00:25:14.029 --> 00:25:14.039 align:start position:0%
responsible to put up the sign that says
 
00:25:16.149 --> 00:25:16.159 align:start position:0%
don't bring your drink into the bathroom
 
00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
or you just don't really care one way or
 
00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:21.320 align:start position:0%
the other and just assume not have the
 
00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:24.640 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission worrying about yeah so
 
00:25:27.669 --> 00:25:27.679 align:start position:0%
Mike testified at the hearing on this
 
00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:30.520 align:start position:0%
bill Mike Henry veu lodging Restaurant
 
00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:34.120 align:start position:0%
Association and um we had a government
 
00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:38.360 align:start position:0%
Affairs meeting with um 25 of The
 
00:25:40.789 --> 00:25:40.799 align:start position:0%
Operators uh so we got a good
 
00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
perspective and feel of how the industry
 
00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
uh you know thinks about this bill um
 
00:25:49.669 --> 00:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
they fully understand uh the motivation
 
00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:54.200 align:start position:0%
for it um they came down with a feeling
 
00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
that it would make it much more
 
00:25:59.590 --> 00:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
difficult in uh managing because they're
 
00:26:01.269 --> 00:26:01.279 align:start position:0%
responsible for the drinking within
 
00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
their establishment and it just would
 
00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
make it much more difficult uh with this
 
00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
uh added um a number of them said uh
 
00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:15.720 align:start position:0%
that more and more establishments are um
 
00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
uh having cameras in uh their facilities
 
00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
uh again it's it it would help to
 
00:26:26.269 --> 00:26:26.279 align:start position:0%
convict someone um afterwards uh it
 
00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:28.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't do anything to prevent the
 
00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:31.480 align:start position:0%
instance uh that you were describing but
 
00:26:35.389 --> 00:26:35.399 align:start position:0%
it would at least have um you know the
 
00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
video of the individual uh doing uh the
 
00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
practice and maybe uh that would deter
 
00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
folks uh but uh generally uh the folks
 
00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
um in the industry think that this would
 
00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:52.520 align:start position:0%
uh make it a little more complicated for
 
00:26:53.909 --> 00:26:53.919 align:start position:0%
them in
 
00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
policing in policing in policing in
 
00:26:59.950 --> 00:26:59.960 align:start position:0%
managing the people their drinks in the
 
00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:02.360 align:start position:0%
over over service and underrage drinking
 
00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
I mean those are the two things they
 
00:27:07.669 --> 00:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
have to be concerned about and um so
 
00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:09.200 align:start position:0%
they would just prefer to leave the law
 
00:27:11.149 --> 00:27:11.159 align:start position:0%
as it is
 
00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
yeah right I mean I remember he was it
 
00:27:15.389 --> 00:27:15.399 align:start position:0%
was clear one way or the other sound
 
00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:17.080 align:start position:0%
like he wasn't really taking a position
 
00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
but it was
 
00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:21.200 align:start position:0%
just okay representative
 
00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
S I mean I know that you represent you
 
00:27:25.870 --> 00:27:25.880 align:start position:0%
represent the industry but you don't
 
00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
represent everybody because I've spoken
 
00:27:29.549 --> 00:27:29.559 align:start position:0%
to several and if I had known this was
 
00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:30.640 align:start position:0%
going to be controversial I would have
 
00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
lined them up to come for this but uh
 
00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:35.200 align:start position:0%
who who just think it's it's a silly law
 
00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
in fact they didn't even know it existed
 
00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
so I guess my counter is if they don't
 
00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:41.000 align:start position:0%
want people drinking in in in their
 
00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
restaurant bathrooms they just put up a
 
00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
sign saying no alcohol in the bathroom I
 
00:27:46.990 --> 00:27:47.000 align:start position:0%
mean if that's really what they need to
 
00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:48.640 align:start position:0%
the extent that somebody is going to
 
00:27:51.669 --> 00:27:51.679 align:start position:0%
break the current law with a sign up
 
00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
there or not they're going to break any
 
00:27:57.630 --> 00:27:57.640 align:start position:0%
sign that you put up whether this law is
 
00:27:59.430 --> 00:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
in existence or not so if they they
 
00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
don't want people drinking in the
 
00:28:02.389 --> 00:28:02.399 align:start position:0%
bathrooms why why wouldn't if they think
 
00:28:04.029 --> 00:28:04.039 align:start position:0%
it makes it easier to say hey no alcohol
 
00:28:07.389 --> 00:28:07.399 align:start position:0%
permitted in the bathroom and
 
00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
then basically nothing has changed for
 
00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
them they can still go in hey you're
 
00:28:13.549 --> 00:28:13.559 align:start position:0%
breaking our policy you know we I don't
 
00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
think we should be making
 
00:28:18.669 --> 00:28:18.679 align:start position:0%
legislation limiting all restaurants
 
00:28:21.669 --> 00:28:21.679 align:start position:0%
because a few want a certain policy they
 
00:28:24.509 --> 00:28:24.519 align:start position:0%
want that policy they can enact it um I
 
00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
think many restaurants in
 
00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:29.880 align:start position:0%
this state don't care or think it's
 
00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
something that they they don't want to
 
00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:32.840 align:start position:0%
worry about or or whatever they don't
 
00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:35.200 align:start position:0%
even know it exists um so the extent
 
00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:36.640 align:start position:0%
that there are people who want that then
 
00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:38.480 align:start position:0%
they just put up a sign I don't
 
00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
understand how that doesn't accomplish
 
00:28:41.669 --> 00:28:41.679 align:start position:0%
the same
 
00:28:43.669 --> 00:28:43.679 align:start position:0%
thing that sounds like a would you
 
00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:45.880 align:start position:0%
believe I would believe would you
 
00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:47.480 align:start position:0%
believe I
 
00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
believe representative
 
00:28:54.149 --> 00:28:54.159 align:start position:0%
perz yeah I I have a question um little
 
00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:56.480 align:start position:0%
little off the bill but is there a way
 
00:28:58.430 --> 00:28:58.440 align:start position:0%
to educate
 
00:29:00.549 --> 00:29:00.559 align:start position:0%
your clients and people who have bars
 
00:29:02.909 --> 00:29:02.919 align:start position:0%
about the dangers to women or it's
 
00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:04.480 align:start position:0%
usually women I mean it could happen to
 
00:29:06.909 --> 00:29:06.919 align:start position:0%
a man having their drink Spike so that
 
00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
you know there you know we could look at
 
00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:10.600 align:start position:0%
some solution if if this bill doesn't
 
00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
pass such as having a safe Zone because
 
00:29:14.549 --> 00:29:14.559 align:start position:0%
it does happen it happens a lot with
 
00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:16.840 align:start position:0%
college kids I I think it happens a lot
 
00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
more than than you know bar owners may
 
00:29:22.029 --> 00:29:22.039 align:start position:0%
may know
 
00:29:25.389 --> 00:29:25.399 align:start position:0%
yep the the industry is aware of it um
 
00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
and to your point I think wants to try
 
00:29:33.789 --> 00:29:33.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
spear in reading the wording
 
00:29:45.909 --> 00:29:45.919 align:start position:0%
here how do you get out of it that a a a
 
00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
a an establishment can still put up a
 
00:29:50.430 --> 00:29:50.440 align:start position:0%
sign saying
 
00:29:53.389 --> 00:29:53.399 align:start position:0%
no no uh you can't drink in the bathroom
 
00:29:56.669 --> 00:29:56.679 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't say that it says that
 
00:30:00.389 --> 00:30:00.399 align:start position:0%
the patrons May take it in take the take
 
00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:03.240 align:start position:0%
the alcohol in the wording is not Bing
 
00:30:06.549 --> 00:30:06.559 align:start position:0%
what you want so as as Danielle said any
 
00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
law we have can be further restricted by
 
00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
The Establishment so if if they want to
 
00:30:14.389 --> 00:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
put up a law they can we're not saying
 
00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:17.000 align:start position:0%
you must allow it just allows the bill
 
00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
allows patrons on premise to
 
00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:20.240 align:start position:0%
establishments to take a purchased
 
00:30:21.909 --> 00:30:21.919 align:start position:0%
beverage into the restroom it doesn't
 
00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
say You must require them if it said
 
00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:27.080 align:start position:0%
must I would I would agree but uh as
 
00:30:28.509 --> 00:30:28.519 align:start position:0%
Danielle said what she was saying
 
00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:30.440 align:start position:0%
any law or regulation we have can be
 
00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:32.200 align:start position:0%
further restricted by any
 
00:30:34.389 --> 00:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
establishment The Establishment can do
 
00:30:36.389 --> 00:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
it he they don't need enabling
 
00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:39.960 align:start position:0%
legislation to allow them to have the
 
00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
further rules and the same thing like
 
00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:43.960 align:start position:0%
right now I do we legalize you can bring
 
00:30:46.389 --> 00:30:46.399 align:start position:0%
it on the Dance Floor last was that last
 
00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
term or on the stage that that was the
 
00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
performers but the performers right but
 
00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
if presumably if the restaurant doesn't
 
00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:56.600 align:start position:0%
want performers consuming alcohol they
 
00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:00.120 align:start position:0%
could they could that I hate the nitpick
 
00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:03.880 align:start position:0%
because I've written specs all my life M
 
00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:07.960 align:start position:0%
this wording directs the patron not the
 
00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:10.960 align:start position:0%
establishment the rule is on the patron
 
00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:13.000 align:start position:0%
it's not on the establishment so it's
 
00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
not clear I think the wording needs to
 
00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:17.240 align:start position:0%
change just a little bit but
 
00:31:22.629 --> 00:31:22.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:22.639 --> 00:31:26.590 align:start position:0%
 
am

00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:29.440 align:start position:0%
maybe I you everything that we do here
 
00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:32.120 align:start position:0%
is on YouTube
 
00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
okay okay I would say that the the way
 
00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
the statue is written okay this is uh
 
00:31:41.509 --> 00:31:41.519 align:start position:0%
terms of rest you know permissible okay
 
00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:43.480 align:start position:0%
um was that originally you know they
 
00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:45.440 align:start position:0%
saying was banned so no beverage can be
 
00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:48.320 align:start position:0%
taken in consumed in foyers hallways or
 
00:31:52.269 --> 00:31:52.279 align:start position:0%
kitchens that's still in the Statue all
 
00:31:56.789 --> 00:31:56.799 align:start position:0%
right so all this sat this is doing is
 
00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
giving guidance about where they
 
00:32:03.029 --> 00:32:03.039 align:start position:0%
can't you where they can't do it it does
 
00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
not go on to tell the establishment how
 
00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:08.440 align:start position:0%
they want to create their own rules of
 
00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:10.440 align:start position:0%
what they can or can't do in their
 
00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:14.200 align:start position:0%
facility okay um but that is did and
 
00:32:15.909 --> 00:32:15.919 align:start position:0%
just says that patrons may take a
 
00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:20.480 align:start position:0%
beverage when I see the may may implies
 
00:32:22.269 --> 00:32:22.279 align:start position:0%
that there are some establish that
 
00:32:24.149 --> 00:32:24.159 align:start position:0%
establishments would be have the right
 
00:32:28.110 --> 00:32:28.120 align:start position:0%
to say no they can't take it now whether
 
00:32:29.909 --> 00:32:29.919 align:start position:0%
you want to add another sentence to it
 
00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:34.600 align:start position:0%
to say however the the the uh the lense
 
00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
he may uh May ban it if if they want to
 
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
you don't really need to do that because
 
00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:43.480 align:start position:0%
the way because the word may is there
 
00:32:45.629 --> 00:32:45.639 align:start position:0%
and exactly because the way the word may
 
00:32:47.629 --> 00:32:47.639 align:start position:0%
is there it's confusing as to who is
 
00:32:50.549 --> 00:32:50.559 align:start position:0%
being directed to do what yeah if if we
 
00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
don't typically do that that's fine it's
 
00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
just not it's speckmans ship that's all
 
00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:56.710 align:start position:0%
just not it's speckmans ship that's all
okay

00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:56.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:32:59.389 --> 00:32:59.399 align:start position:0%
great uh uh is there anybody else who
 
00:33:01.710 --> 00:33:01.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Henry anybody else have any
 
00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:03.080 align:start position:0%
strong opinions one way or the other
 
00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
about this
 
00:33:08.029 --> 00:33:08.039 align:start position:0%
bill all right uh representative
 
00:33:09.669 --> 00:33:09.679 align:start position:0%
Sullivan second by representative
 
00:33:14.430 --> 00:33:14.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:18.789 --> 00:33:18.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:20.840 align:start position:0%
discussions any
 
00:33:22.909 --> 00:33:22.919 align:start position:0%
discussions you want to wave your flag
 
00:33:22.919 --> 00:33:24.509 align:start position:0%
discussions you want to wave your flag
over

00:33:24.509 --> 00:33:24.519 align:start position:0%
over
 
00:33:27.269 --> 00:33:27.279 align:start position:0%
there I don't think there's any need for
 
00:33:31.909 --> 00:33:31.919 align:start position:0%
legisl in this in this of any type I
 
00:33:34.549 --> 00:33:34.559 align:start position:0%
think the restaurant owners have the
 
00:33:37.950 --> 00:33:37.960 align:start position:0%
ability to U you know create their own
 
00:33:39.549 --> 00:33:39.559 align:start position:0%
environment and I don't think anybody's
 
00:33:41.669 --> 00:33:41.679 align:start position:0%
going to sit there and say you can go
 
00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
ahead and have a beer and no the
 
00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:45.240 align:start position:0%
restaurant they can't though right now
 
00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
they can't they can allow allow that so
 
00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
what does this I don't understand why
 
00:33:51.909 --> 00:33:51.919 align:start position:0%
this is here because right now it is
 
00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
illegal to take if you're if you're at
 
00:33:55.909 --> 00:33:55.919 align:start position:0%
the bar and you buy a beer and then you
 
00:33:57.990 --> 00:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
have to go use the restroom you you
 
00:34:00.549 --> 00:34:00.559 align:start position:0%
cannnot take it in there it's illegal
 
00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:02.760 align:start position:0%
illegal to take it in there so this will
 
00:34:04.669 --> 00:34:04.679 align:start position:0%
simply enable to do exactly what you
 
00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:05.960 align:start position:0%
just said which is to allow the
 
00:34:07.269 --> 00:34:07.279 align:start position:0%
restaurant to create the environment
 
00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:08.399 align:start position:0%
they want if they don't want people
 
00:34:09.589 --> 00:34:09.599 align:start position:0%
taking them in there they can put up a
 
00:34:13.069 --> 00:34:13.079 align:start position:0%
sign if if they don't care then then
 
00:34:15.109 --> 00:34:15.119 align:start position:0%
then this will allow a patron to bring
 
00:34:16.389 --> 00:34:16.399 align:start position:0%
it with
 
00:34:20.669 --> 00:34:20.679 align:start position:0%
them so so the concern is the is the
 
00:34:22.349 --> 00:34:22.359 align:start position:0%
concern is as I said in the in the I
 
00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:23.919 align:start position:0%
don't know maybe you weren't here uh
 
00:34:26.990 --> 00:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
last week but I have a I have a friend
 
00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
who was at a
 
00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:33.560 align:start position:0%
restaurant and or at a bar and had one
 
00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:36.800 align:start position:0%
drink and then woke up in a hotel room
 
00:34:38.829 --> 00:34:38.839 align:start position:0%
that wasn't theirs and had clearly been
 
00:34:42.069 --> 00:34:42.079 align:start position:0%
raped and so somebody had spiked their
 
00:34:44.470 --> 00:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
drink with ruies or whatever drugs that
 
00:34:47.470 --> 00:34:47.480 align:start position:0%
they use to spike the drink and so my
 
00:34:49.950 --> 00:34:49.960 align:start position:0%
argument is that it's best to be in
 
00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:52.520 align:start position:0%
control of your drink at all times and
 
00:34:54.470 --> 00:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
that's when I was in college there was a
 
00:34:56.149 --> 00:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
whole education campaign because there
 
00:34:57.150 --> 00:34:57.160 align:start position:0%
was a problem that some of the
 
00:34:59.870 --> 00:34:59.880 align:start position:0%
fraternity where where people's drinks
 
00:35:01.390 --> 00:35:01.400 align:start position:0%
were being spiked and so they had a
 
00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:03.400 align:start position:0%
whole campaign of always being control
 
00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:07.720 align:start position:0%
of your your your drink and so the law
 
00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:09.480 align:start position:0%
currently prevents people from being
 
00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:11.200 align:start position:0%
able to be in control of their drink if
 
00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:12.640 align:start position:0%
they need to use the restroom and they
 
00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
have a drink they have no place to put
 
00:35:17.310 --> 00:35:17.320 align:start position:0%
it maybe they're alone at the bar maybe
 
00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
they're whatever there any number of
 
00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:21.160 align:start position:0%
reasons why if they choose to bring it
 
00:35:24.109 --> 00:35:24.119 align:start position:0%
in them in with them into the restroom
 
00:35:25.829 --> 00:35:25.839 align:start position:0%
that would provide an element of safety
 
00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:26.720 align:start position:0%
because they're in control of their
 
00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
drink at that time and that's the
 
00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
purpose of right now that they would not
 
00:35:32.069 --> 00:35:32.079 align:start position:0%
be allowed to do that so that's the goal
 
00:35:34.069 --> 00:35:34.079 align:start position:0%
of this
 
00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:37.000 align:start position:0%
bill does that make sense I'm not saying
 
00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
you have to take the drinks into the
 
00:35:42.349 --> 00:35:42.359 align:start position:0%
bathroom well you know this is
 
00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
hypothetical things that that might
 
00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
happen I mean if if you get a spike
 
00:35:48.349 --> 00:35:48.359 align:start position:0%
drink I don't think you being in the
 
00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:50.200 align:start position:0%
bathroom is going to be a problem no
 
00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
that's not I think you missed it is if
 
00:35:55.309 --> 00:35:55.319 align:start position:0%
if I leave my drink on the bar and run
 
00:35:59.470 --> 00:35:59.480 align:start position:0%
to the restroom right then a person who
 
00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
wants to spike my drink has an
 
00:36:02.349 --> 00:36:02.359 align:start position:0%
opportunity because there's nobody
 
00:36:04.309 --> 00:36:04.319 align:start position:0%
monitoring that drink if I have that
 
00:36:05.950 --> 00:36:05.960 align:start position:0%
drink in my possession in the bathroom
 
00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:07.480 align:start position:0%
then it would be much more challenging
 
00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
yes it's always a way you could probably
 
00:36:10.910 --> 00:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
get it in if I'm you know talking to
 
00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:12.680 align:start position:0%
representative post and I'm having a
 
00:36:14.069 --> 00:36:14.079 align:start position:0%
drink and here somebody could do
 
00:36:15.829 --> 00:36:15.839 align:start position:0%
something but it's a lot less likely
 
00:36:17.589 --> 00:36:17.599 align:start position:0%
that that would happen in that
 
00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:19.560 align:start position:0%
circumstance if it's just sitting on the
 
00:36:21.589 --> 00:36:21.599 align:start position:0%
table it's different so I I uh
 
00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:23.400 align:start position:0%
parliamentary that was uh I should not
 
00:36:24.910 --> 00:36:24.920 align:start position:0%
have allowed him to speak because he's
 
00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:27.160 align:start position:0%
not on the subcommittee so not
 
00:36:29.109 --> 00:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
withstanding I did I did want him to at
 
00:36:31.390 --> 00:36:31.400 align:start position:0%
least have one more chance to make his
 
00:36:34.510 --> 00:36:34.520 align:start position:0%
case Okay is the motion clear uh the the
 
00:36:36.430 --> 00:36:36.440 align:start position:0%
motion is ought to pass all those in
 
00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:39.960 align:start position:0%
favor raise their hand one two three
 
00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:41.829 align:start position:0%
favor raise their hand one two three
four

00:36:41.829 --> 00:36:41.839 align:start position:0%
four
 
00:36:45.309 --> 00:36:45.319 align:start position:0%
five and who's
 
00:36:49.349 --> 00:36:49.359 align:start position:0%
opposed six seven okay so that's so that
 
00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:04.750 --> 00:37:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:11.829 --> 00:37:11.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:14.270 --> 00:37:14.280 align:start position:0%
edit I'm I'm perfectly willing to let it
 
00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
go but okay my ranking member says I
 
00:37:20.349 --> 00:37:20.359 align:start position:0%
should say something okay
 
00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:23.880 align:start position:0%
blame I want to to pass the the sentence
 
00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
should say if the restaurant if the
 
00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
establishment allows house it's up to
 
00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
the establishment patrons may take
 
00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:32.440 align:start position:0%
beverages that have been purchased from
 
00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:34.040 align:start position:0%
The Establishment into the restroom over
 
00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
that establishment if the restaurant
 
00:37:40.309 --> 00:37:40.319 align:start position:0%
allows otherwise this is open to ambigu
 
00:37:44.109 --> 00:37:44.119 align:start position:0%
ambiguity ly right it should say ly yeah
 
00:37:44.119 --> 00:37:46.150 align:start position:0%
ambiguity ly right it should say ly yeah
that's

00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:46.160 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
allows patrons Bay
 
00:37:58.190 --> 00:37:58.200 align:start position:0%
take I think that's what
 
00:37:59.430 --> 00:37:59.440 align:start position:0%
yeah but I don't know I'm just trying to
 
00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
think if that if that kind of is
 
00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:04.200 align:start position:0%
counterproductive because because
 
00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:05.720 align:start position:0%
basically you're saying that that it's
 
00:38:08.829 --> 00:38:08.839 align:start position:0%
still illegal unless they
 
00:38:11.829 --> 00:38:11.839 align:start position:0%
they unless unless you're basically
 
00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
saying it remains illegal unless the
 
00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:16.040 align:start position:0%
restaurant comes out with a policy
 
00:38:17.829 --> 00:38:17.839 align:start position:0%
saying that you can have it in there and
 
00:38:21.470 --> 00:38:21.480 align:start position:0%
all I'm saying is it's legal unless the
 
00:38:22.990 --> 00:38:23.000 align:start position:0%
opposite unless they don't want it in
 
00:38:25.150 --> 00:38:25.160 align:start position:0%
there then put those words in there like
 
00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
that because right now it says let's go
 
00:38:29.069 --> 00:38:29.079 align:start position:0%
fight it
 
00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
out okay we do have the we do have the
 
00:38:35.589 --> 00:38:35.599 align:start position:0%
enforcer here
 
00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
enforcer Deputy Deputy enforcer Deputy
 
00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:42.640 align:start position:0%
enforcer um so if I could maybe help
 
00:38:45.069 --> 00:38:45.079 align:start position:0%
with this um for this legislation
 
00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:47.240 align:start position:0%
particularly if you want to allow drinks
 
00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:48.920 align:start position:0%
in the restroom you can simply just
 
00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:50.640 align:start position:0%
strike the word restroom from The
 
00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
Establishment there's other laws that
 
00:38:54.270 --> 00:38:54.280 align:start position:0%
create required areas of service
 
00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
approved areas of service but you
 
00:38:57.069 --> 00:38:57.079 align:start position:0%
wouldn't even need the language that
 
00:38:58.670 --> 00:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
said now patrons are allowed to bring it
 
00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:00.640 align:start position:0%
in if you just strike the word restroom
 
00:39:02.309 --> 00:39:02.319 align:start position:0%
oh that's much better then you don't
 
00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
even need an extra
 
00:39:07.230 --> 00:39:07.240 align:start position:0%
line and then like other words in other
 
00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
words that whole bold face don't need it
 
00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:12.040 align:start position:0%
you don't even need it you can just
 
00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
write the word restroom all we're doing
 
00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
is drinks in the restro all we're doing
 
00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
is just deleting the word restrooms then
 
00:39:21.790 --> 00:39:21.800 align:start position:0%
that way we don't fight over that
 
00:39:24.390 --> 00:39:24.400 align:start position:0%
way in other words it just says they
 
00:39:27.230 --> 00:39:27.240 align:start position:0%
they can't they can't uh no B Li shall
 
00:39:29.309 --> 00:39:29.319 align:start position:0%
be served or
 
00:39:31.390 --> 00:39:31.400 align:start position:0%
consumed so
 
00:39:33.790 --> 00:39:33.800 align:start position:0%
theoretically um this does allow them to
 
00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:36.160 align:start position:0%
drink their drink in the bathroom
 
00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't we are deleting the
 
00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:41.640 align:start position:0%
word bathroom restroom
 
00:39:44.109 --> 00:39:44.119 align:start position:0%
correct a little bit
 
00:39:47.109 --> 00:39:47.119 align:start position:0%
simpler I like
 
00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:49.640 align:start position:0%
simple all right I'll reach out to OS
 
00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:52.040 align:start position:0%
and just have them fix that well we can
 
00:39:53.349 --> 00:39:53.359 align:start position:0%
I'll take care of that you'll do it okay
 
00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
I'll take care of that okay so we're
 
00:39:57.990 --> 00:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
basically uh let's re re
 
00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
thanks Daniel uh motion motion to
 
00:40:02.109 --> 00:40:02.119 align:start position:0%
reconsider representa hunt moves to
 
00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:04.640 align:start position:0%
reconsider our action sub commmittee all
 
00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:06.760 align:start position:0%
those in favor reconsidering please say
 
00:40:10.589 --> 00:40:10.599 align:start position:0%
I all right that's unanimous um now the
 
00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
question now will be that
 
00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:14.720 align:start position:0%
representative uh make sure I have the
 
00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
right piece of paper in front of
 
00:40:22.589 --> 00:40:22.599 align:start position:0%
me okay uh representative s second by
 
00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
representative buroughs moves the
 
00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
amendment uh which we don't have yet so
 
00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
theoretically we will right now okay
 
00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:37.190 align:start position:0%
theoretically we will right now okay
um

00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
discussion for and an
 
00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:43.990 align:start position:0%
discussion for and an
amendment

00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.550 align:start position:0%
amendment
that

00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:40:50.910 --> 00:40:50.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:53.069 align:start position:0%
 
face

00:40:53.069 --> 00:40:53.079 align:start position:0%
face
 
00:40:56.349 --> 00:40:56.359 align:start position:0%
sentence okay thank you very much okay
 
00:40:58.630 --> 00:40:58.640 align:start position:0%
so that we will will take that up at
 
00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:10.589 --> 00:41:10.599 align:start position:0%
okay a hotel to your we've already did
 
00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
we already passed that okay we already
 
00:41:14.270 --> 00:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
passed that
 
00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:17.000 align:start position:0%
yeah that's already been
 
00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:20.800 align:start position:0%
done okay
 
00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:25.349 align:start position:0%
done okay
uh

00:41:25.349 --> 00:41:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
okay all right uh
 
00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:29.470 align:start position:0%
okay all right uh
so

00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:29.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
yesterday uh my meeting in Pittsburgh
 
00:41:36.630 --> 00:41:36.640 align:start position:0%
ended at 2 o'clock but my flight didn't
 
00:41:38.829 --> 00:41:38.839 align:start position:0%
leave till 6
 
00:41:41.790 --> 00:41:41.800 align:start position:0%
o'clock and so therefore I had lots of
 
00:41:44.349 --> 00:41:44.359 align:start position:0%
time on my hands
 
00:41:49.390 --> 00:41:49.400 align:start position:0%
and got really informed about this issue
 
00:42:01.950 --> 00:42:01.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:04.349 --> 00:43:04.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:04.359 --> 00:43:16.430 align:start position:0%
 
mention

00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:41.630 --> 00:43:41.640 align:start position:0%
okay no that would
 
00:43:43.950 --> 00:43:43.960 align:start position:0%
be next
 
00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:46.960 align:start position:0%
extension okay so what what we turned
 
00:43:50.430 --> 00:43:50.440 align:start position:0%
out is that um we've heard in the public
 
00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
uh testimony was that um this sort of
 
00:43:56.109 --> 00:43:56.119 align:start position:0%
this problem really got created with the
 
00:43:58.150 --> 00:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety
 
00:44:01.069 --> 00:44:01.079 align:start position:0%
uh had a statute in which they generated
 
00:44:04.510 --> 00:44:04.520 align:start position:0%
rules um which um I think most of us
 
00:44:06.630 --> 00:44:06.640 align:start position:0%
would probably read those rules and say
 
00:44:09.630 --> 00:44:09.640 align:start position:0%
boy they need to revisit these
 
00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
rules and but we don't really have that
 
00:44:15.390 --> 00:44:15.400 align:start position:0%
purview so I will I'm trust from the
 
00:44:17.710 --> 00:44:17.720 align:start position:0%
Department that they will they will re
 
00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
revisit their rules anyways um I've
 
00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
heard that they have a whole new more
 
00:44:25.069 --> 00:44:25.079 align:start position:0%
creative system that they hope to
 
00:44:28.750 --> 00:44:28.760 align:start position:0%
implement um that will not only be the
 
00:44:31.829 --> 00:44:31.839 align:start position:0%
green red green but also be able to
 
00:44:34.030 --> 00:44:34.040 align:start position:0%
identify whether the the license or the
 
00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:35.680 align:start position:0%
document that's being handed is is a
 
00:44:38.829 --> 00:44:38.839 align:start position:0%
forgery it's a fake uh but that they
 
00:44:41.470 --> 00:44:41.480 align:start position:0%
assure me that whatever storage system
 
00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
or any that being transmitted back to uh
 
00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:46.720 align:start position:0%
the department of safety who would have
 
00:44:48.990 --> 00:44:49.000 align:start position:0%
the the main computer who reference it
 
00:44:51.390 --> 00:44:51.400 align:start position:0%
that they um they would only last it
 
00:44:53.870 --> 00:44:53.880 align:start position:0%
would only last for about 30 seconds and
 
00:44:57.549 --> 00:44:57.559 align:start position:0%
then that whole question of that request
 
00:45:00.670 --> 00:45:00.680 align:start position:0%
would disappear and so that um no one
 
00:45:03.430 --> 00:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
have to be fear fear that that that
 
00:45:05.390 --> 00:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
their information is being stored at the
 
00:45:08.030 --> 00:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
department of safety um not withstanding
 
00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
that um getting back now to the uh
 
00:45:14.589 --> 00:45:14.599 align:start position:0%
underlying issue that we have which was
 
00:45:19.190 --> 00:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
that in terms of the um and I had a very
 
00:45:21.069 --> 00:45:21.079 align:start position:0%
interesting conversation with the
 
00:45:23.309 --> 00:45:23.319 align:start position:0%
consumer protection because my original
 
00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
idea was to stick it in the consumer
 
00:45:28.670 --> 00:45:28.680 align:start position:0%
protection act as a uh
 
00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
um is a violation um and um I was
 
00:45:37.549 --> 00:45:37.559 align:start position:0%
convinced by Brandon that to not do that
 
00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't solve anything and he
 
00:45:41.470 --> 00:45:41.480 align:start position:0%
says in his mind and evidently consumer
 
00:45:44.750 --> 00:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
protection gets a lot of phone calls of
 
00:45:47.710 --> 00:45:47.720 align:start position:0%
complaints about that the businesses are
 
00:45:49.870 --> 00:45:49.880 align:start position:0%
storing personal identification
 
00:45:52.309 --> 00:45:52.319 align:start position:0%
information and he is very grateful that
 
00:45:54.549 --> 00:45:54.559 align:start position:0%
we are some we're trying to address this
 
00:45:59.109 --> 00:45:59.119 align:start position:0%
issue um but that the same time he um he
 
00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:01.800 align:start position:0%
dides not want to have or anybody think
 
00:46:03.549 --> 00:46:03.559 align:start position:0%
that they have that they could just
 
00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:06.160 align:start position:0%
randomly go into certain businesses and
 
00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
try to audit their business and see if
 
00:46:09.349 --> 00:46:09.359 align:start position:0%
they really are
 
00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
storing information whether they are or
 
00:46:16.109 --> 00:46:16.119 align:start position:0%
not the accusation is there and the uh
 
00:46:18.910 --> 00:46:18.920 align:start position:0%
Department of safety's statute has the
 
00:46:21.109 --> 00:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
implementation that they could be
 
00:46:24.589 --> 00:46:24.599 align:start position:0%
storing names and driver's license okay
 
00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
so what we're have here is something
 
00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:29.640 align:start position:0%
that uh we do one people a group of
 
00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:32.640 align:start position:0%
people we do know uh who have the power
 
00:46:35.549 --> 00:46:35.559 align:start position:0%
to investigate and have the the power to
 
00:46:38.030 --> 00:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
look into somebody's computer is that's
 
00:46:40.510 --> 00:46:40.520 align:start position:0%
the uh Liquor Commission because we want
 
00:46:42.069 --> 00:46:42.079 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they are reporting
 
00:46:45.430 --> 00:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
their sales correctly and I'm reporting
 
00:46:49.349 --> 00:46:49.359 align:start position:0%
uh you know terms of of um that so they
 
00:46:50.670 --> 00:46:50.680 align:start position:0%
can look at their computer and they can
 
00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
see if somebody was really intentionally
 
00:46:55.309 --> 00:46:55.319 align:start position:0%
storing the data even though we've been
 
00:46:58.990 --> 00:46:59.000 align:start position:0%
told you know from multiple PES that
 
00:47:01.589 --> 00:47:01.599 align:start position:0%
that that is not the intent uh that no
 
00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:04.240 align:start position:0%
one wanted to store your information
 
00:47:08.109 --> 00:47:08.119 align:start position:0%
however there was some uh awareness that
 
00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:12.440 align:start position:0%
um it when it came to um pawn shops that
 
00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
pawn shops do are actually required to
 
00:47:17.829 --> 00:47:17.839 align:start position:0%
carry some information so we're this is
 
00:47:19.589 --> 00:47:19.599 align:start position:0%
uh we're assuming this is not a pawn
 
00:47:22.109 --> 00:47:22.119 align:start position:0%
chop issue okay we're taking this is
 
00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
this is a uh issue of New Hampshire
 
00:47:27.870 --> 00:47:27.880 align:start position:0%
convenience stores
 
00:47:31.790 --> 00:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
we we call off- premises lenses that
 
00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
that it's their issue and that we want
 
00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
to make it clear that they cannot be
 
00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
storing any that data and that is what
 
00:47:42.510 --> 00:47:42.520 align:start position:0%
the paragraph
 
00:47:44.910 --> 00:47:44.920 align:start position:0%
says assuming everybody's had a chance
 
00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
to read it anybody have any reactions uh
 
00:47:50.230 --> 00:47:50.240 align:start position:0%
negative or posit this is not an
 
00:47:51.750 --> 00:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
official Amendment so we would have to
 
00:47:54.910 --> 00:47:54.920 align:start position:0%
have another subcommittee to to vote on
 
00:47:57.470 --> 00:47:57.480 align:start position:0%
this but uh this is your chance now for
 
00:47:59.190 --> 00:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
anybody to tell us this is a bad way to
 
00:48:01.549 --> 00:48:01.559 align:start position:0%
do it so yes if you would like to come
 
00:48:09.390 --> 00:48:09.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:11.870 --> 00:48:11.880 align:start position:0%
and I'm not exactly sure you have to
 
00:48:15.150 --> 00:48:15.160 align:start position:0%
turn the mic on yep push the button
 
00:48:17.750 --> 00:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
perfect I'm not exactly sure when we
 
00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:18.870 align:start position:0%
perfect I'm not exactly sure when we
have

00:48:18.870 --> 00:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:48:22.589 --> 00:48:22.599 align:start position:0%
laws how they get enforced um and and
 
00:48:24.309 --> 00:48:24.319 align:start position:0%
and I'll give you a short story about I
 
00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
I found out in 2013
 
00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:30.640 align:start position:0%
that there was a law that said that um
 
00:48:33.230 --> 00:48:33.240 align:start position:0%
you couldn't charge more to an uninsured
 
00:48:34.910 --> 00:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
Health insured
 
00:48:37.589 --> 00:48:37.599 align:start position:0%
person than you could to an insured
 
00:48:40.349 --> 00:48:40.359 align:start position:0%
Health um Health person yet when I went
 
00:48:42.230 --> 00:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
to the State Insurance website there
 
00:48:44.230 --> 00:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
were two buttons are you insured or are
 
00:48:45.710 --> 00:48:45.720 align:start position:0%
you not insured so you could check and
 
00:48:47.630 --> 00:48:47.640 align:start position:0%
see how much a typical procedure would
 
00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
cost in either in any hospital and I
 
00:48:54.510 --> 00:48:54.520 align:start position:0%
proved to the attorney general that this
 
00:48:57.470 --> 00:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
was illegal that that the law said that
 
00:48:58.990 --> 00:48:59.000 align:start position:0%
you can't charge more because it was
 
00:49:00.630 --> 00:49:00.640 align:start position:0%
like three times more for somebody
 
00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
uninsured and his response to me back
 
00:49:06.589 --> 00:49:06.599 align:start position:0%
then was well nothing was put in the law
 
00:49:08.190 --> 00:49:08.200 align:start position:0%
that said who's going to enforce it so
 
00:49:09.829 --> 00:49:09.839 align:start position:0%
there's nothing I can do okay so I can
 
00:49:11.069 --> 00:49:11.079 align:start position:0%
actually tell you that one because I
 
00:49:13.589 --> 00:49:13.599 align:start position:0%
wrote that law and so I know exactly
 
00:49:15.549 --> 00:49:15.559 align:start position:0%
what you're talking about and you did
 
00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
call the wrong people uh the uh consumer
 
00:49:21.069 --> 00:49:21.079 align:start position:0%
protection act the AG is exempt from the
 
00:49:23.190 --> 00:49:23.200 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act when it comes to
 
00:49:25.230 --> 00:49:25.240 align:start position:0%
insurance that that issue would should
 
00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:27.240 align:start position:0%
have been dealt with with the insurance
 
00:49:28.470 --> 00:49:28.480 align:start position:0%
department you should have called the
 
00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
insurance department and they would have
 
00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:33.240 align:start position:0%
walked you through how that law was
 
00:49:35.549 --> 00:49:35.559 align:start position:0%
being enforced well I actually did it
 
00:49:37.870 --> 00:49:37.880 align:start position:0%
was the insurance department's website
 
00:49:39.230 --> 00:49:39.240 align:start position:0%
it was the state I understand that but
 
00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:40.960 align:start position:0%
you needed to talk to a real human being
 
00:49:43.069 --> 00:49:43.079 align:start position:0%
I actually did talk to them and got
 
00:49:44.670 --> 00:49:44.680 align:start position:0%
nowhere and so went to the attorney
 
00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
general so there was no way I could I me
 
00:49:51.150 --> 00:49:51.160 align:start position:0%
as a as a consumer needs to know what
 
00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
what happens when something finds out so
 
00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at this and I'm saying well
 
00:49:57.270 --> 00:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
first of all I think that there should
 
00:50:00.190 --> 00:50:00.200 align:start position:0%
be a huge penalty to any any entity
 
00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
that's the penalty is very huge they can
 
00:50:04.750 --> 00:50:04.760 align:start position:0%
lose their license to operate they
 
00:50:06.510 --> 00:50:06.520 align:start position:0%
should it should be more than that when
 
00:50:07.710 --> 00:50:07.720 align:start position:0%
you're when you're talking about
 
00:50:09.870 --> 00:50:09.880 align:start position:0%
people's identity but who's going to
 
00:50:13.069 --> 00:50:13.079 align:start position:0%
enforce it the Liquor Commission so does
 
00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
it are you adding that to this bill so
 
00:50:16.789 --> 00:50:16.799 align:start position:0%
that people know when they look at a
 
00:50:19.150 --> 00:50:19.160 align:start position:0%
bill this bill if you uh it seems like
 
00:50:20.670 --> 00:50:20.680 align:start position:0%
you're pretty astute and using your
 
00:50:23.710 --> 00:50:23.720 align:start position:0%
computer um I would urge you to look up
 
00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
U Section 179
 
00:50:30.190 --> 00:50:30.200 align:start position:0%
and you will see 179 is enforced by The
 
00:50:32.670 --> 00:50:32.680 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission and and they're very
 
00:50:34.510 --> 00:50:34.520 align:start position:0%
serious people they they actually carry
 
00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
guns you know they're they're so they
 
00:50:41.430 --> 00:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
they will absolutely if they find that
 
00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
some Merchant is storing that data they
 
00:50:47.069 --> 00:50:47.079 align:start position:0%
will threaten his license say that on
 
00:50:48.829 --> 00:50:48.839 align:start position:0%
the law so if I look up that law I'm
 
00:50:50.789 --> 00:50:50.799 align:start position:0%
going to see this is the the party I go
 
00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
to because it didn't say it it didn't
 
00:50:55.230 --> 00:50:55.240 align:start position:0%
say it on the law that I looked up and
 
00:50:57.190 --> 00:50:57.200 align:start position:0%
went to the State Library and did a
 
00:50:59.230 --> 00:50:59.240 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of research on and I never
 
00:51:01.349 --> 00:51:01.359 align:start position:0%
found any any other place where it said
 
00:51:04.190 --> 00:51:04.200 align:start position:0%
in that law who I should go to okay so
 
00:51:05.870 --> 00:51:05.880 align:start position:0%
um we uh when you're finished I will
 
00:51:07.349 --> 00:51:07.359 align:start position:0%
have the Liquor Commission come up tell
 
00:51:10.309 --> 00:51:10.319 align:start position:0%
you what exactly RSA that they could
 
00:51:12.150 --> 00:51:12.160 align:start position:0%
yank that person's license if they
 
00:51:14.470 --> 00:51:14.480 align:start position:0%
violated stat could or will or or what
 
00:51:16.230 --> 00:51:16.240 align:start position:0%
if the if they don't do it then where do
 
00:51:20.789 --> 00:51:20.799 align:start position:0%
I go they I can assure you that if they
 
00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
see a violation if they see someone
 
00:51:24.789 --> 00:51:24.799 align:start position:0%
storing this
 
00:51:27.430 --> 00:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
information they will abs absolutely
 
00:51:29.789 --> 00:51:29.799 align:start position:0%
threaten that they will require him they
 
00:51:31.870 --> 00:51:31.880 align:start position:0%
will have a hearing and they will bring
 
00:51:34.990 --> 00:51:35.000 align:start position:0%
that that leny in it would be just as
 
00:51:37.870 --> 00:51:37.880 align:start position:0%
bad as if they if the lensey sold to
 
00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:40.640 align:start position:0%
someone who was under 21 or someone that
 
00:51:42.789 --> 00:51:42.799 align:start position:0%
the lensey served someone who was over
 
00:51:45.910 --> 00:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
served who was drunk what if it's
 
00:51:49.950 --> 00:51:49.960 align:start position:0%
Macy's who Macy's Macy's as in the
 
00:51:52.870 --> 00:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
department store scanning licenses to uh
 
00:51:55.549 --> 00:51:55.559 align:start position:0%
to verify somebody that they're that
 
00:51:58.109 --> 00:51:58.119 align:start position:0%
they are the person on the credit card
 
00:52:01.589 --> 00:52:01.599 align:start position:0%
name so we we are this subject what
 
00:52:04.309 --> 00:52:04.319 align:start position:0%
we're doing is trying to we we we
 
00:52:06.190 --> 00:52:06.200 align:start position:0%
working on the concept is how do we make
 
00:52:09.150 --> 00:52:09.160 align:start position:0%
it enforcable how do we which is really
 
00:52:11.990 --> 00:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
what your question was so in terms of
 
00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
Macy's if Macy's has a system to to ask
 
00:52:21.870 --> 00:52:21.880 align:start position:0%
you to scan your card I can tell you
 
00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
that um you can call the Attorney
 
00:52:26.030 --> 00:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
General on this one because he did tell
 
00:52:29.870 --> 00:52:29.880 align:start position:0%
me a story in which uh he got a
 
00:52:33.190 --> 00:52:33.200 align:start position:0%
complaint that someone uh went into it
 
00:52:35.870 --> 00:52:35.880 align:start position:0%
was a um
 
00:52:39.470 --> 00:52:39.480 align:start position:0%
uh rental I guess it was it campers it
 
00:52:41.390 --> 00:52:41.400 align:start position:0%
was a camper store like campers world or
 
00:52:44.430 --> 00:52:44.440 align:start position:0%
something okay and they went in there
 
00:52:46.470 --> 00:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
and before they let the customer walk
 
00:52:49.589 --> 00:52:49.599 align:start position:0%
around the store they wanted to scan
 
00:52:49.599 --> 00:52:50.870 align:start position:0%
around the store they wanted to scan
their

00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:52:54.349 --> 00:52:54.359 align:start position:0%
license and uh and he absolutely called
 
00:52:56.470 --> 00:52:56.480 align:start position:0%
up that establishment and that
 
00:53:00.549 --> 00:53:00.559 align:start position:0%
establishment stop doing that okay and
 
00:53:02.030 --> 00:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
that was the Attorney General's office
 
00:53:04.510 --> 00:53:04.520 align:start position:0%
because camper that kind of retail
 
00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
transaction he does regulate so in this
 
00:53:11.430 --> 00:53:11.440 align:start position:0%
case we're saying is if a liquor
 
00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
establishment any liquor license
 
00:53:17.069 --> 00:53:17.079 align:start position:0%
C which is either a restaurant or a
 
00:53:17.079 --> 00:53:18.109 align:start position:0%
C which is either a restaurant or a
convenience

00:53:18.109 --> 00:53:18.119 align:start position:0%
convenience
 
00:53:20.710 --> 00:53:20.720 align:start position:0%
store beer distributor for that matter
 
00:53:23.589 --> 00:53:23.599 align:start position:0%
but Scott left the room I I I get what
 
00:53:26.990 --> 00:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
you're saying and I see by the by by
 
00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
the the ACT here prohibiting businesses
 
00:53:31.870 --> 00:53:31.880 align:start position:0%
from scanning licenses when selling
 
00:53:35.190 --> 00:53:35.200 align:start position:0%
alcohol or tobacco products now I am
 
00:53:37.069 --> 00:53:37.079 align:start position:0%
kind of I think the Catalyst that
 
00:53:40.109 --> 00:53:40.119 align:start position:0%
started this whole whole issue on on on
 
00:53:41.789 --> 00:53:41.799 align:start position:0%
this because I was writing articles on
 
00:53:43.710 --> 00:53:43.720 align:start position:0%
seeing this the driver's licensees
 
00:53:46.390 --> 00:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
scanned uh but it's not you know it's
 
00:53:49.150 --> 00:53:49.160 align:start position:0%
not limited to just um alcohol and
 
00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
tobacco it's other people that are
 
00:53:54.750 --> 00:53:54.760 align:start position:0%
scanning and even at uh I guess I think
 
00:53:56.990 --> 00:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
it was the dairy or the wind
 
00:53:59.390 --> 00:53:59.400 align:start position:0%
um election polls they were scanning the
 
00:54:01.549 --> 00:54:01.559 align:start position:0%
driver's licenses there I guess they
 
00:54:04.430 --> 00:54:04.440 align:start position:0%
were asking the election no polls that's
 
00:54:06.270 --> 00:54:06.280 align:start position:0%
said there's a state statute that
 
00:54:09.109 --> 00:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
requires them to to scan to look at your
 
00:54:11.349 --> 00:54:11.359 align:start position:0%
license look at your license but not
 
00:54:14.230 --> 00:54:14.240 align:start position:0%
scan to check to sure not use a scanning
 
00:54:16.589 --> 00:54:16.599 align:start position:0%
SCH this this is pole pad using a
 
00:54:18.030 --> 00:54:18.040 align:start position:0%
scanning system you would I guess there
 
00:54:19.549 --> 00:54:19.559 align:start position:0%
would have to be separate legislation
 
00:54:21.190 --> 00:54:21.200 align:start position:0%
that would go the election law committee
 
00:54:23.950 --> 00:54:23.960 align:start position:0%
to say this need to go further that yes
 
00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
but I hope you see this as a good start
 
00:54:29.349 --> 00:54:29.359 align:start position:0%
step forward but I think that has
 
00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
enforceability um I want you to hear
 
00:54:34.349 --> 00:54:34.359 align:start position:0%
that I it I don't think I don't see
 
00:54:36.510 --> 00:54:36.520 align:start position:0%
where um okay I I will now have the
 
00:54:39.390 --> 00:54:39.400 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission come up and tell you
 
00:54:42.750 --> 00:54:42.760 align:start position:0%
exactly what statute they have to
 
00:54:45.109 --> 00:54:45.119 align:start position:0%
enforce this so for the Macy's that's
 
00:54:47.270 --> 00:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
going to have to wait for another bill
 
00:54:50.950 --> 00:54:50.960 align:start position:0%
uh between you and me if some Merchant
 
00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:52.109 align:start position:0%
uh between you and me if some Merchant
some

00:54:52.109 --> 00:54:52.119 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:54:54.670 --> 00:54:54.680 align:start position:0%
business ask me for my license and I
 
00:54:56.829 --> 00:54:56.839 align:start position:0%
haven't done any business with him
 
00:54:58.990 --> 00:54:59.000 align:start position:0%
I haven't done anything and they had
 
00:55:01.670 --> 00:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
they say I want I want to scan your
 
00:55:04.870 --> 00:55:04.880 align:start position:0%
license to see whether you're 21 or not
 
00:55:07.470 --> 00:55:07.480 align:start position:0%
or scanning for whatever reason I would
 
00:55:09.510 --> 00:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
say thank you very much and leave the
 
00:55:11.190 --> 00:55:11.200 align:start position:0%
establishment that's that's what I would
 
00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
say too but unfortunately it's that's
 
00:55:15.549 --> 00:55:15.559 align:start position:0%
not the world we live in now and we've
 
00:55:18.309 --> 00:55:18.319 align:start position:0%
taught people that it's okay to to to
 
00:55:20.390 --> 00:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
give out this identity especially
 
00:55:22.190 --> 00:55:22.200 align:start position:0%
younger people they don't understand the
 
00:55:24.029 --> 00:55:24.039 align:start position:0%
world that we should be living in and
 
00:55:27.069 --> 00:55:27.079 align:start position:0%
what we're living in is 1984 but I'm not
 
00:55:29.309 --> 00:55:29.319 align:start position:0%
going to carry this out any longer are
 
00:55:31.390 --> 00:55:31.400 align:start position:0%
we saying that you there there are
 
00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:33.440 align:start position:0%
businesses that without doing any
 
00:55:35.789 --> 00:55:35.799 align:start position:0%
transactions you not handing in a card
 
00:55:37.549 --> 00:55:37.559 align:start position:0%
or anything like that just to walk in
 
00:55:40.309 --> 00:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
the door or asking to scan your license
 
00:55:42.150 --> 00:55:42.160 align:start position:0%
so that's that that's what he explained
 
00:55:43.789 --> 00:55:43.799 align:start position:0%
I my guess
 
00:55:46.990 --> 00:55:47.000 align:start position:0%
is my guess is it's a it's it's a slow
 
00:55:49.029 --> 00:55:49.039 align:start position:0%
place they don't have a lot going on and
 
00:55:51.109 --> 00:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
they were skinny because they they
 
00:55:53.029 --> 00:55:53.039 align:start position:0%
actually probably did make a copy of it
 
00:55:54.589 --> 00:55:54.599 align:start position:0%
and they were putting you on their
 
00:55:56.670 --> 00:55:56.680 align:start position:0%
mailing list
 
00:55:58.829 --> 00:55:58.839 align:start position:0%
or they didn't like the looks of you or
 
00:56:01.510 --> 00:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
they were profiling you yeah
 
00:56:04.349 --> 00:56:04.359 align:start position:0%
yeah it's a big issue it's a big issue
 
00:56:07.510 --> 00:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
and it needs it needs
 
00:56:09.390 --> 00:56:09.400 align:start position:0%
further um
 
00:56:12.670 --> 00:56:12.680 align:start position:0%
Attention our privacy information needs
 
00:56:14.349 --> 00:56:14.359 align:start position:0%
this is a power this is a consumer
 
00:56:16.589 --> 00:56:16.599 align:start position:0%
beware mean I think yet yes you're doing
 
00:56:19.630 --> 00:56:19.640 align:start position:0%
a great job in in informing consumers
 
00:56:22.150 --> 00:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
that they should not be whipping out
 
00:56:24.549 --> 00:56:24.559 align:start position:0%
their driver's license for anybody who
 
00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
asked for it they should really be more
 
00:56:29.150 --> 00:56:29.160 align:start position:0%
conscious of don't don't give it to
 
00:56:31.150 --> 00:56:31.160 align:start position:0%
anybody don't only give it well the
 
00:56:34.789 --> 00:56:34.799 align:start position:0%
thing is is our our our it
 
00:56:38.630 --> 00:56:38.640 align:start position:0%
our it shouldn't be possible what we are
 
00:56:41.589 --> 00:56:41.599 align:start position:0%
we are our our our ability to move
 
00:56:45.029 --> 00:56:45.039 align:start position:0%
freely which is a constitutional right
 
00:56:47.829 --> 00:56:47.839 align:start position:0%
is limited by the fact that the state
 
00:56:49.630 --> 00:56:49.640 align:start position:0%
says you have to give us this
 
00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
information and we're going to retain it
 
00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
and we're going to give you a card with
 
00:56:55.309 --> 00:56:55.319 align:start position:0%
that information on it that's a driver's
 
00:56:57.510 --> 00:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
license that that information should be
 
00:56:59.670 --> 00:56:59.680 align:start position:0%
only for driving it shouldn't be for
 
00:57:01.430 --> 00:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
everything else on earth like our social
 
00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
security is now that that isn't that
 
00:57:04.950 --> 00:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
isn't really quite true we use it for
 
00:57:07.069 --> 00:57:07.079 align:start position:0%
identification for a number of different
 
00:57:09.390 --> 00:57:09.400 align:start position:0%
things we do use it that way but
 
00:57:11.870 --> 00:57:11.880 align:start position:0%
originally when when we were told I I
 
00:57:14.630 --> 00:57:14.640 align:start position:0%
mean you don't look like you know like
 
00:57:17.430 --> 00:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
if you go back years and years this you
 
00:57:19.630 --> 00:57:19.640 align:start position:0%
talked about slippery slopes this is the
 
00:57:22.069 --> 00:57:22.079 align:start position:0%
slippery slope is it is used for a lot
 
00:57:23.789 --> 00:57:23.799 align:start position:0%
of stuff now just like our social
 
00:57:25.390 --> 00:57:25.400 align:start position:0%
security number is that was supposed to
 
00:57:27.549 --> 00:57:27.559 align:start position:0%
be for for for employment information
 
00:57:30.750 --> 00:57:30.760 align:start position:0%
only now if I want to pay my electric
 
00:57:32.670 --> 00:57:32.680 align:start position:0%
bill I got to give the last four digits
 
00:57:35.230 --> 00:57:35.240 align:start position:0%
of my social security number give me a
 
00:57:37.549 --> 00:57:37.559 align:start position:0%
rest you know I mean now it's used the
 
00:57:39.029 --> 00:57:39.039 align:start position:0%
social security number is used for
 
00:57:40.549 --> 00:57:40.559 align:start position:0%
everything it's give me your papers
 
00:57:42.829 --> 00:57:42.839 align:start position:0%
please every place you go we are living
 
00:57:46.309 --> 00:57:46.319 align:start position:0%
in 1984 and we and when we turn when we
 
00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
first had driver's licenses it was only
 
00:57:51.430 --> 00:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
supposed to be for driving but it's the
 
00:57:53.190 --> 00:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
slippery slope it's become for
 
00:57:55.349 --> 00:57:55.359 align:start position:0%
everything else Under the Sun just like
 
00:57:57.309 --> 00:57:57.319 align:start position:0%
the Social Security number and now we
 
00:57:59.470 --> 00:57:59.480 align:start position:0%
are in a situation where elderly people
 
00:58:00.910 --> 00:58:00.920 align:start position:0%
are being ripped off their homes are
 
00:58:02.990 --> 00:58:03.000 align:start position:0%
being stolen for criminy
 
00:58:06.470 --> 00:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
sakes um so where is the slippery slope
 
00:58:07.589 --> 00:58:07.599 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:58:10.150 --> 00:58:10.160 align:start position:0%
end and that's that's a problem that we
 
00:58:12.270 --> 00:58:12.280 align:start position:0%
need to you know at least in the in the
 
00:58:15.109 --> 00:58:15.119 align:start position:0%
liyy of die State we need to look at
 
00:58:17.029 --> 00:58:17.039 align:start position:0%
this as a whole and say we've got to
 
00:58:17.039 --> 00:58:18.390 align:start position:0%
this as a whole and say we've got to
stop

00:58:18.390 --> 00:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
stop
 
00:58:22.470 --> 00:58:22.480 align:start position:0%
this fair enough thank you does anybody
 
00:58:24.109 --> 00:58:24.119 align:start position:0%
want to ask me
 
00:58:26.750 --> 00:58:26.760 align:start position:0%
anything I think we're all set okay
 
00:58:29.950 --> 00:58:29.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:58:39.430 --> 00:58:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:43.349 align:start position:0%
 
to

00:58:43.349 --> 00:58:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:47.430 --> 00:58:47.440 align:start position:0%
hello um so this is an amendment just to
 
00:58:52.150 --> 00:58:52.160 align:start position:0%
a current statute within title 13 uh RSA
 
00:58:56.270 --> 00:58:56.280 align:start position:0%
17956 through RSA 17959
 
00:58:58.470 --> 00:58:58.480 align:start position:0%
covers our prosecution Authority our
 
00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement of everything within the
 
00:59:02.349 --> 00:59:02.359 align:start position:0%
title um one thing that we would have to
 
00:59:04.230 --> 00:59:04.240 align:start position:0%
do if this law were to pass is we would
 
00:59:07.349 --> 00:59:07.359 align:start position:0%
have to um amend a rule to establish a
 
00:59:11.270 --> 00:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
penalty for this particular law if um we
 
00:59:13.470 --> 00:59:13.480 align:start position:0%
want a specific penalty for the law
 
00:59:16.109 --> 00:59:16.119 align:start position:0%
that's where we would put it in here um
 
00:59:18.069 --> 00:59:18.079 align:start position:0%
if that's what the committee chooses a a
 
00:59:20.309 --> 00:59:20.319 align:start position:0%
flat fine or or suspension for the law
 
00:59:22.510 --> 00:59:22.520 align:start position:0%
then it would go in the statute but as
 
00:59:24.349 --> 00:59:24.359 align:start position:0%
of right now all penalties fin
 
00:59:26.990 --> 00:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
suspensions points uh an administrative
 
00:59:29.430 --> 00:59:29.440 align:start position:0%
rule again those statutes gives us the
 
00:59:31.109 --> 00:59:31.119 align:start position:0%
authority to create the rule to create
 
00:59:33.150 --> 00:59:33.160 align:start position:0%
the penalties in Rule and then enforce
 
00:59:35.589 --> 00:59:35.599 align:start position:0%
it accordingly from there um also one
 
00:59:37.950 --> 00:59:37.960 align:start position:0%
thing to mention too um if this law were
 
00:59:40.190 --> 00:59:40.200 align:start position:0%
to pass we do have a very we do have
 
00:59:42.109 --> 00:59:42.119 align:start position:0%
very good communication with our leny
 
00:59:44.029 --> 00:59:44.039 align:start position:0%
we're constantly sending out industry
 
00:59:46.309 --> 00:59:46.319 align:start position:0%
circulars to the lenses where we could
 
00:59:48.109 --> 00:59:48.119 align:start position:0%
update them about this law inform them
 
00:59:50.750 --> 00:59:50.760 align:start position:0%
of the changes the penalties um and what
 
00:59:53.390 --> 00:59:53.400 align:start position:0%
they need to do to stay in
 
00:59:58.029 --> 00:59:58.039 align:start position:0%
compliance any questions comme
 
01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:00.440 align:start position:0%
members thank you very
 
01:00:04.789 --> 01:00:04.799 align:start position:0%
much okay so uh this is assuming that
 
01:00:07.710 --> 01:00:07.720 align:start position:0%
everybody's kosher with this that um
 
01:00:10.069 --> 01:00:10.079 align:start position:0%
we're we'll take this up uh once we have
 
01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
the amendment drawn
 
01:00:17.390 --> 01:00:17.400 align:start position:0%
up are you is y you could certainly yes
 
01:00:18.910 --> 01:00:18.920 align:start position:0%
um thank you for letting me ask a
 
01:00:21.789 --> 01:00:21.799 align:start position:0%
question so technology is changing very
 
01:00:23.710 --> 01:00:23.720 align:start position:0%
rapidly I understand the concept of
 
01:00:27.109 --> 01:00:27.119 align:start position:0%
storage but do you think that to really
 
01:00:29.069 --> 01:00:29.079 align:start position:0%
draw the full circle we need to say
 
01:00:31.390 --> 01:00:31.400 align:start position:0%
something about transmitting you know it
 
01:00:32.670 --> 01:00:32.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean you have to store it you
 
01:00:34.870 --> 01:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
could real time transmit it somewhere
 
01:00:36.190 --> 01:00:36.200 align:start position:0%
well you got to you got to store it
 
01:00:37.789 --> 01:00:37.799 align:start position:0%
before you can transmit it I don't know
 
01:00:40.789 --> 01:00:40.799 align:start position:0%
about that yeah you got you got you got
 
01:00:43.990 --> 01:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
you can't you just like you can't send F
 
01:00:45.670 --> 01:00:45.680 align:start position:0%
file's got to exist before you can do
 
01:00:49.150 --> 01:00:49.160 align:start position:0%
something with it yeah but um ass that
 
01:00:51.589 --> 01:00:51.599 align:start position:0%
the storage means you cannot transmit it
 
01:00:54.990 --> 01:00:55.000 align:start position:0%
to your you know marketing partner right
 
01:00:57.390 --> 01:00:57.400 align:start position:0%
so was describing about what's going on
 
01:00:58.829 --> 01:00:58.839 align:start position:0%
maybe John you want to come up and just
 
01:01:00.470 --> 01:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
talk about what you guys are working in
 
01:01:02.870 --> 01:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
the department of safety because the the
 
01:01:05.470 --> 01:01:05.480 align:start position:0%
issue is not just 21 and everything like
 
01:01:08.230 --> 01:01:08.240 align:start position:0%
that the issue is a greater issue which
 
01:01:10.510 --> 01:01:10.520 align:start position:0%
is that a lot of people are getting uh
 
01:01:13.789 --> 01:01:13.799 align:start position:0%
false IDs and how we're going to sniff
 
01:01:16.190 --> 01:01:16.200 align:start position:0%
that out and so this is for motor
 
01:01:18.789 --> 01:01:18.799 align:start position:0%
vehicles and uh the director and thank
 
01:01:20.470 --> 01:01:20.480 align:start position:0%
you for coming Mr chairman thank you so
 
01:01:21.870 --> 01:01:21.880 align:start position:0%
much members of the committee thank you
 
01:01:24.270 --> 01:01:24.280 align:start position:0%
for allowing me to speak this morning uh
 
01:01:25.589 --> 01:01:25.599 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for the uh the
 
01:01:27.069 --> 01:01:27.079 align:start position:0%
phone call call last night and the
 
01:01:28.789 --> 01:01:28.799 align:start position:0%
opportunity to talk about some of the
 
01:01:31.349 --> 01:01:31.359 align:start position:0%
things that we're doing at the DMV to
 
01:01:34.150 --> 01:01:34.160 align:start position:0%
make this process more seamless uh make
 
01:01:36.990 --> 01:01:37.000 align:start position:0%
sure it complies with Rule and law and
 
01:01:39.029 --> 01:01:39.039 align:start position:0%
um make sure that businesses know what
 
01:01:41.470 --> 01:01:41.480 align:start position:0%
they can and can't do and also that
 
01:01:44.190 --> 01:01:44.200 align:start position:0%
consumers like the um um the resident
 
01:01:45.789 --> 01:01:45.799 align:start position:0%
that we just heard from uh concerns that
 
01:01:47.549 --> 01:01:47.559 align:start position:0%
are out there actually the concerns that
 
01:01:49.390 --> 01:01:49.400 align:start position:0%
were highlighted here just a few moments
 
01:01:52.750 --> 01:01:52.760 align:start position:0%
ago I do hear about on a regular basis
 
01:01:54.670 --> 01:01:54.680 align:start position:0%
um both from businesses what can I do
 
01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
what can't I do and from residents that
 
01:01:58.750 --> 01:01:58.760 align:start position:0%
say well I've had my license scanned I
 
01:02:00.870 --> 01:02:00.880 align:start position:0%
didn't want that uh where is my personal
 
01:02:02.630 --> 01:02:02.640 align:start position:0%
information is it on a server somewhere
 
01:02:04.829 --> 01:02:04.839 align:start position:0%
how do I get it back and who is going to
 
01:02:06.190 --> 01:02:06.200 align:start position:0%
enforce it who's going to follow up and
 
01:02:09.029 --> 01:02:09.039 align:start position:0%
investigate this so um I've been in this
 
01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
position for just under three years um
 
01:02:13.150 --> 01:02:13.160 align:start position:0%
it's come to my attention from the
 
01:02:14.470 --> 01:02:14.480 align:start position:0%
minute I landed there at the driver
 
01:02:15.950 --> 01:02:15.960 align:start position:0%
Privacy Act
 
01:02:18.510 --> 01:02:18.520 align:start position:0%
2614 um so one of the things that we've
 
01:02:20.349 --> 01:02:20.359 align:start position:0%
done is there is a state statute that
 
01:02:23.430 --> 01:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
was passed in 2019 that allows for dld
 
01:02:25.549 --> 01:02:25.559 align:start position:0%
DV the driver LIC data verification
 
01:02:25.559 --> 01:02:26.510 align:start position:0%
DV the driver LIC data verification
program

01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:02:28.069 --> 01:02:28.079 align:start position:0%
it's run through anva the American
 
01:02:29.430 --> 01:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
Association of Motor Vehicle
 
01:02:31.589 --> 01:02:31.599 align:start position:0%
administrators um anva is the best
 
01:02:34.190 --> 01:02:34.200 align:start position:0%
practice Organization for DMVs uh
 
01:02:36.230 --> 01:02:36.240 align:start position:0%
throughout North America they run the
 
01:02:38.309 --> 01:02:38.319 align:start position:0%
program so basically what this means to
 
01:02:40.349 --> 01:02:40.359 align:start position:0%
the representative to the chair's point
 
01:02:42.829 --> 01:02:42.839 align:start position:0%
it's a red light green light system and
 
01:02:44.789 --> 01:02:44.799 align:start position:0%
we had to uh do it in two parts we've
 
01:02:46.069 --> 01:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
been working on it over the last year
 
01:02:48.430 --> 01:02:48.440 align:start position:0%
and a half first part was syncing with
 
01:02:50.589 --> 01:02:50.599 align:start position:0%
Social Security uh which we were one of
 
01:02:52.549 --> 01:02:52.559 align:start position:0%
two states in the country that wasn't on
 
01:02:55.309 --> 01:02:55.319 align:start position:0%
this program uh New Hampshire and Alaska
 
01:02:57.789 --> 01:02:57.799 align:start position:0%
uh now we are on the program uh Social
 
01:02:58.950 --> 01:02:58.960 align:start position:0%
Security somebody loses a social
 
01:03:00.670 --> 01:03:00.680 align:start position:0%
security card because we have the
 
01:03:02.870 --> 01:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
program they can more quickly get a
 
01:03:04.910 --> 01:03:04.920 align:start position:0%
replacement card because the DMV
 
01:03:06.269 --> 01:03:06.279 align:start position:0%
database has their information they've
 
01:03:08.309 --> 01:03:08.319 align:start position:0%
already shown one in the past the second
 
01:03:09.870 --> 01:03:09.880 align:start position:0%
part of it that's exciting and that
 
01:03:12.069 --> 01:03:12.079 align:start position:0%
really applies to this conversation is
 
01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
um about two months ago maybe a little
 
01:03:16.870 --> 01:03:16.880 align:start position:0%
bit more we signed off on the retail
 
01:03:18.789 --> 01:03:18.799 align:start position:0%
aspect of it so what does that mean uh
 
01:03:20.470 --> 01:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
for context of what we're talking about
 
01:03:23.549 --> 01:03:23.559 align:start position:0%
this morning means a convenience store
 
01:03:27.029 --> 01:03:27.039 align:start position:0%
um any uh place that sells alcohol or
 
01:03:31.269 --> 01:03:31.279 align:start position:0%
tobacco um could sign on with anva they
 
01:03:32.230 --> 01:03:32.240 align:start position:0%
actually are the ones that do the
 
01:03:34.430 --> 01:03:34.440 align:start position:0%
onboarding so you go directly to the
 
01:03:36.269 --> 01:03:36.279 align:start position:0%
trusted organization which we already
 
01:03:37.910 --> 01:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
use at the DMV and DMVs around the
 
01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
country use their platform they already
 
01:03:41.470 --> 01:03:41.480 align:start position:0%
have a pipeline into our system they're
 
01:03:44.710 --> 01:03:44.720 align:start position:0%
a trusted Source you on board with Amber
 
01:03:46.870 --> 01:03:46.880 align:start position:0%
uh you have an agreement with Amber you
 
01:03:48.390 --> 01:03:48.400 align:start position:0%
have the scanning equipment that you
 
01:03:52.069 --> 01:03:52.079 align:start position:0%
need uh John comes into the store to buy
 
01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:54.640 align:start position:0%
whatever you're selling I give you my
 
01:03:58.510 --> 01:03:58.520 align:start position:0%
license they scan my license it goes to
 
01:04:01.910 --> 01:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
anva it goes to the DMV it comes back to
 
01:04:04.029 --> 01:04:04.039 align:start position:0%
amva and they get a response back and I
 
01:04:05.349 --> 01:04:05.359 align:start position:0%
ask for the screen of what it actually
 
01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
looks like if I'm the business uh the
 
01:04:09.789 --> 01:04:09.799 align:start position:0%
response comes back is true it's all you
 
01:04:13.230 --> 01:04:13.240 align:start position:0%
need to know true it's not a fake ID uh
 
01:04:15.470 --> 01:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
that information is real true the red
 
01:04:16.950 --> 01:04:16.960 align:start position:0%
light green light at that point it
 
01:04:18.910 --> 01:04:18.920 align:start position:0%
disappears uh off the anvas system
 
01:04:21.549 --> 01:04:21.559 align:start position:0%
within 30 seconds or less and now the
 
01:04:23.390 --> 01:04:23.400 align:start position:0%
business knows uh whether it's a test
 
01:04:25.269 --> 01:04:25.279 align:start position:0%
drive for a car here you go you can take
 
01:04:27.230 --> 01:04:27.240 align:start position:0%
the fob and and go out with the $80,000
 
01:04:29.349 --> 01:04:29.359 align:start position:0%
car I know who you are I see the photo
 
01:04:31.190 --> 01:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
that's you and I got the true response
 
01:04:32.630 --> 01:04:32.640 align:start position:0%
for the information on on the front of
 
01:04:35.789 --> 01:04:35.799 align:start position:0%
the license so your retail stores can
 
01:04:38.630 --> 01:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
use it your automobile dealers uh can
 
01:04:41.349 --> 01:04:41.359 align:start position:0%
use it um the hospital Association can
 
01:04:44.510 --> 01:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
use it to check in patients um and
 
01:04:46.309 --> 01:04:46.319 align:start position:0%
establishments that sell liquor and
 
01:04:49.510 --> 01:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
tobacco can use it I want to thank uh
 
01:04:51.390 --> 01:04:51.400 align:start position:0%
director armaganian uh we've already had
 
01:04:53.510 --> 01:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
conversations about this uh he's very
 
01:04:55.150 --> 01:04:55.160 align:start position:0%
interested we actually have reached out
 
01:04:56.990 --> 01:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
to Philip quinland who is the point of
 
01:04:59.670 --> 01:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
contact for the program for amva and uh
 
01:05:01.029 --> 01:05:01.039 align:start position:0%
as of yesterday we're we're going to
 
01:05:03.990 --> 01:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
finalize a date um to uh to get together
 
01:05:06.029 --> 01:05:06.039 align:start position:0%
myself director armaganian and Phil
 
01:05:07.710 --> 01:05:07.720 align:start position:0%
quinland from anva and talk about the
 
01:05:10.349 --> 01:05:10.359 align:start position:0%
possibility so I really think DV is
 
01:05:12.269 --> 01:05:12.279 align:start position:0%
going to solve this issue and you won't
 
01:05:14.470 --> 01:05:14.480 align:start position:0%
have the storage uh you will have the
 
01:05:17.430 --> 01:05:17.440 align:start position:0%
scanning but the 2019 statute allows for
 
01:05:19.549 --> 01:05:19.559 align:start position:0%
it um but it's only for the true false
 
01:05:21.630 --> 01:05:21.640 align:start position:0%
response on the license so uh that's
 
01:05:23.390 --> 01:05:23.400 align:start position:0%
where we're heading and I think it's
 
01:05:25.269 --> 01:05:25.279 align:start position:0%
going to clear up a lot of what the the
 
01:05:27.870 --> 01:05:27.880 align:start position:0%
chair said um I got to tell you the the
 
01:05:30.950 --> 01:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
rule set relating to driver privacy um
 
01:05:32.870 --> 01:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
you know corresponding to the statute
 
01:05:35.750 --> 01:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
believe uh from 2003 and
 
01:05:40.910 --> 01:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
2004 or or two and three um it's uh it's
 
01:05:44.390 --> 01:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
a lot and um to try to understand it and
 
01:05:48.390 --> 01:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
relate it back to uh RSA 2614 and RSA
 
01:05:51.309 --> 01:05:51.319 align:start position:0%
26312 um it needs to be simplified so
 
01:05:53.829 --> 01:05:53.839 align:start position:0%

at another time next up is question
 
01:07:11.950 --> 01:07:11.960 align:start position:0%
before you go on are we going to be
 
01:07:14.069 --> 01:07:14.079 align:start position:0%
evaluating your Amendment or something
 
01:07:15.430 --> 01:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
else I'm going to be sending this
 
01:07:17.349 --> 01:07:17.359 align:start position:0%
amendment to legislative services oh
 
01:07:19.150 --> 01:07:19.160 align:start position:0%
okay so this this is what we're looking
 
01:07:21.990 --> 01:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
at this is it should look like this okay
 
01:07:25.150 --> 01:07:25.160 align:start position:0%
I have a quick question chair yes um so
 
01:07:27.309 --> 01:07:27.319 align:start position:0%
Danielle said that we would have to put
 
01:07:29.109 --> 01:07:29.119 align:start position:0%
a either it's going to be in rule for
 
01:07:30.670 --> 01:07:30.680 align:start position:0%
put the penalty he already they already
 
01:07:32.870 --> 01:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
have rule making Authority so we're just
 
01:07:34.710 --> 01:07:34.720 align:start position:0%
going to leave it that way yeah they you
 
01:07:36.510 --> 01:07:36.520 align:start position:0%
know they'll go ahead and as you might
 
01:07:38.630 --> 01:07:38.640 align:start position:0%
remember we had a previous discussion
 
01:07:39.789 --> 01:07:39.799 align:start position:0%
about uh
 
01:07:42.150 --> 01:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
penalties and we decid that there was
 
01:07:43.990 --> 01:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
one penalty that we did want to put in
 
01:07:46.750 --> 01:07:46.760 align:start position:0%
the statute and that was for someone who
 
01:07:49.910 --> 01:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
died but that otherwise um the
 
01:07:52.549 --> 01:07:52.559 align:start position:0%
department does the penalties through Ru
 
01:07:56.510 --> 01:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
making all their general rule rules
 
01:07:58.069 --> 01:07:58.079 align:start position:0%
I'm looking over them to see them say
 
01:07:58.079 --> 01:08:01.069 align:start position:0%
I'm looking over them to see them say
yes

01:08:01.069 --> 01:08:01.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:04.150 --> 01:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
John but they're in deep in thought yes
 
01:08:06.150 --> 01:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
that's the way that's the way it's done
 
01:08:07.349 --> 01:08:07.359 align:start position:0%
so we don't need to give them rule
 
01:08:10.390 --> 01:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
making Authority they already have it so
 
01:08:15.309 --> 01:08:15.319 align:start position:0%
okay um I just uh emailed or texted uh
 
01:08:18.189 --> 01:08:18.199 align:start position:0%
Peter Lehman uh because he was here but
 
01:08:19.349 --> 01:08:19.359 align:start position:0%
he's not here
 
01:08:22.709 --> 01:08:22.719 align:start position:0%
anymore um to study the privatization of
 
01:08:24.070 --> 01:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
the Liquor
 
01:08:27.829 --> 01:08:27.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:29.709 --> 01:08:29.719 align:start position:0%
is there anyone here who thinks this is
 
01:08:32.189 --> 01:08:32.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:35.950 --> 01:08:35.960 align:start position:0%
idea think it's a yeah private
 
01:08:38.309 --> 01:08:38.319 align:start position:0%
privatizing right anybody want to speak
 
01:08:41.309 --> 01:08:41.319 align:start position:0%
for I I I'm not I wouldn't say I'm Pro
 
01:08:44.910 --> 01:08:44.920 align:start position:0%
or against I right I mean I guess if if
 
01:08:46.749 --> 01:08:46.759 align:start position:0%
if we go down that direction I think we
 
01:08:48.470 --> 01:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
need to have a good faith we don't want
 
01:08:50.070 --> 01:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
to Stack with a bunch of people who want
 
01:08:51.749 --> 01:08:51.759 align:start position:0%
it privatized or stack it with a bunch
 
01:08:53.430 --> 01:08:53.440 align:start position:0%
of people who are Love The Liquor
 
01:08:55.669 --> 01:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
Commission I think
 
01:08:59.030 --> 01:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
my experience so far on committees uh or
 
01:09:01.550 --> 01:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
study commissions hasn't commissions
 
01:09:03.910 --> 01:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
rather hasn't been great and I just feel
 
01:09:07.070 --> 01:09:07.080 align:start position:0%
like um it's really easy to say you're
 
01:09:09.309 --> 01:09:09.319 align:start position:0%
doing something and not have anything
 
01:09:10.910 --> 01:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
actually like
 
01:09:13.630 --> 01:09:13.640 align:start position:0%
the I was on a commission with you yes
 
01:09:15.990 --> 01:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
that was predetermined before Mia just
 
01:09:19.390 --> 01:09:19.400 align:start position:0%
like I was and uh and so I yeah I I
 
01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
think if you're GNA do it then like
 
01:09:22.390 --> 01:09:22.400 align:start position:0%
actually do a deep dive I mean I think
 
01:09:24.030 --> 01:09:24.040 align:start position:0%
there's some interesting questions to go
 
01:09:26.110 --> 01:09:26.120 align:start position:0%
in here it doesn't mean you know people
 
01:09:27.349 --> 01:09:27.359 align:start position:0%
in this room probably think I want to
 
01:09:29.269 --> 01:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
privatize I wouldn't even say that I am
 
01:09:31.309 --> 01:09:31.319 align:start position:0%
curious what the benefits could be and
 
01:09:33.510 --> 01:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
if we have a study commission that would
 
01:09:35.149 --> 01:09:35.159 align:start position:0%
actually look at what are the benefits
 
01:09:36.590 --> 01:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
of the current system versus what are
 
01:09:38.390 --> 01:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
the benefits if we were not have it and
 
01:09:40.430 --> 01:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
to have some sort of objective way to
 
01:09:42.269 --> 01:09:42.279 align:start position:0%
achieve that that would be an
 
01:09:44.910 --> 01:09:44.920 align:start position:0%
interesting thing um I'm just concerned
 
01:09:46.990 --> 01:09:47.000 align:start position:0%
that you would have people who aren't
 
01:09:48.430 --> 01:09:48.440 align:start position:0%
there in good faith but are coming in
 
01:09:49.349 --> 01:09:49.359 align:start position:0%
with a
 
01:09:51.910 --> 01:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
pre the problem is the commission can be
 
01:09:54.510 --> 01:09:54.520 align:start position:0%
stacked with people and and so I just I
 
01:09:56.270 --> 01:09:56.280 align:start position:0%
don't have a ton of
 
01:09:57.990 --> 01:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
after my my experience on a commission
 
01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
and commissions so talk about a
 
01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
commission yeah this afternoon also so
 
01:10:04.830 --> 01:10:04.840 align:start position:0%
um yeah I know there's another one
 
01:10:06.750 --> 01:10:06.760 align:start position:0%
coming but anyways I think it's an
 
01:10:08.750 --> 01:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
interesting question and I would I would
 
01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
love to actually see it studied in a
 
01:10:15.669 --> 01:10:15.679 align:start position:0%
good faith way um I am I'm a little
 
01:10:17.430 --> 01:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
skeptical about how the problem is
 
01:10:19.229 --> 01:10:19.239 align:start position:0%
getting it if you're really going to do
 
01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
an empirical discussion you know you
 
01:10:23.590 --> 01:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
would say is okay you have to go look
 
01:10:27.470 --> 01:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
and see where it's been done mhm and it
 
01:10:29.709 --> 01:10:29.719 align:start position:0%
the only case that's even close to doing
 
01:10:33.630 --> 01:10:33.640 align:start position:0%
it was Maine and and they it was the end
 
01:10:37.030 --> 01:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
result was what you those of us who were
 
01:10:39.669 --> 01:10:39.679 align:start position:0%
opposed to the idea of privatization was
 
01:10:41.870 --> 01:10:41.880 align:start position:0%
that it it meant a radical reduction in
 
01:10:44.590 --> 01:10:44.600 align:start position:0%
state revenue you're basically sharing
 
01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
whatever the state was making you're
 
01:10:48.189 --> 01:10:48.199 align:start position:0%
sharing that Revenue now with private
 
01:10:52.470 --> 01:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
businesses so uh as a republican you and
 
01:10:54.310 --> 01:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
Li and somewhat accused of being a
 
01:10:56.470 --> 01:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
Libertarian every once in a while that
 
01:10:58.470 --> 01:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
that you would think that's great yeah
 
01:10:59.990 --> 01:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
government shouldn't be in this business
 
01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
you know government should not be in
 
01:11:02.870 --> 01:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
anything that you're going to say it's a
 
01:11:04.830 --> 01:11:04.840 align:start position:0%
sin and you like regulating sins what's
 
01:11:06.830 --> 01:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
that you're going to say the sin things
 
01:11:08.550 --> 01:11:08.560 align:start position:0%
are what the government should bu but I
 
01:11:09.910 --> 01:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
that is true I have said that to you
 
01:11:11.669 --> 01:11:11.679 align:start position:0%
before that I that that the one thing
 
01:11:13.430 --> 01:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
that state you government could should
 
01:11:16.630 --> 01:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
do is sin but um I mean I I generally
 
01:11:18.310 --> 01:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
also am accused of being a Libertarian
 
01:11:21.669 --> 01:11:21.679 align:start position:0%
despite the D next to my name um
 
01:11:23.830 --> 01:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
but I know I mean I think I think it'd
 
01:11:25.350 --> 01:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
be interesting I think it would be
 
01:11:26.709 --> 01:11:26.719 align:start position:0%
interesting study to do if we could do
 
01:11:28.709 --> 01:11:28.719 align:start position:0%
it effectively you to have an outside
 
01:11:30.470 --> 01:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
entity doing it you would have to be
 
01:11:32.630 --> 01:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
can't be anybody on that commission
 
01:11:35.189 --> 01:11:35.199 align:start position:0%
should have their fingers on that study
 
01:11:38.030 --> 01:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
that study needs to be truly independent
 
01:11:39.830 --> 01:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
yeah independent and you're going to
 
01:11:42.870 --> 01:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
spend lots of money and and but at the
 
01:11:44.870 --> 01:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
end of the day the the same results
 
01:11:47.030 --> 01:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
going to come back is yes you're you're
 
01:11:49.870 --> 01:11:49.880 align:start position:0%
you're you're shooting based on that
 
01:11:52.149 --> 01:11:52.159 align:start position:0%
comment you shouldn't be on the
 
01:11:54.149 --> 01:11:54.159 align:start position:0%
commission why I would you should not be
 
01:11:55.270 --> 01:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
on that commission I should not be
 
01:11:56.270 --> 01:11:56.280 align:start position:0%
because you're going to kill the Golden
 
01:11:58.110 --> 01:11:58.120 align:start position:0%
Goose I mean that's that's the whole
 
01:12:00.510 --> 01:12:00.520 align:start position:0%
point yeah representative
 
01:12:03.990 --> 01:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
spear the the obligation of a business
 
01:12:05.709 --> 01:12:05.719 align:start position:0%
is to make money for the owners or the
 
01:12:07.750 --> 01:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
stockholders of that business there is
 
01:12:09.910 --> 01:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
no essential obligation to make any
 
01:12:12.510 --> 01:12:12.520 align:start position:0%
money for the state and and that's the
 
01:12:15.870 --> 01:12:15.880 align:start position:0%
overarching thing and so therefore the
 
01:12:18.669 --> 01:12:18.679 align:start position:0%
whole concept seems to be against what
 
01:12:20.350 --> 01:12:20.360 align:start position:0%
we set the Lial Commission of four in
 
01:12:23.669 --> 01:12:23.679 align:start position:0%
the first place so I which was what
 
01:12:25.830 --> 01:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
which was to make money for the state y
 
01:12:29.669 --> 01:12:29.679 align:start position:0%
uh see I would differ I would say that
 
01:12:31.350 --> 01:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
because they have multiple tasks the
 
01:12:35.189 --> 01:12:35.199 align:start position:0%
other task is enforcing uh alcohol
 
01:12:37.790 --> 01:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
consumption in the state to making sure
 
01:12:39.709 --> 01:12:39.719 align:start position:0%
that it is done that is important it is
 
01:12:42.709 --> 01:12:42.719 align:start position:0%
done uh safely yes and I believe that
 
01:12:45.229 --> 01:12:45.239 align:start position:0%
our forefathers you know not that I was
 
01:12:47.189 --> 01:12:47.199 align:start position:0%
in the room back in
 
01:12:50.149 --> 01:12:50.159 align:start position:0%
1934 when they passed this legislation I
 
01:12:53.910 --> 01:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
thought you were that uh that they they
 
01:12:55.950 --> 01:12:55.960 align:start position:0%
that part of the reason they choose to
 
01:12:57.870 --> 01:12:57.880 align:start position:0%
be a controlled state is they thought
 
01:13:01.910 --> 01:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
the state would be uh better apt at
 
01:13:05.950 --> 01:13:05.960 align:start position:0%
controlling um who who was able to I I
 
01:13:07.310 --> 01:13:07.320 align:start position:0%
have no disagreement with that I think
 
01:13:09.189 --> 01:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
those are the two-prong things that we
 
01:13:13.669 --> 01:13:13.679 align:start position:0%
would lose if we win private and as as
 
01:13:16.709 --> 01:13:16.719 align:start position:0%
as revenues go down sorry sorry as
 
01:13:20.030 --> 01:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
revenues go down I have seen in other
 
01:13:24.510 --> 01:13:24.520 align:start position:0%
states where the sale of alcohol ends up
 
01:13:28.629 --> 01:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
being in in less than lovely places and
 
01:13:30.910 --> 01:13:30.920 align:start position:0%
that people are getting shot youing
 
01:13:33.750 --> 01:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
holding up liquor stores we we're in a
 
01:13:34.990 --> 01:13:35.000 align:start position:0%
we have we have a very good
 
01:13:36.629 --> 01:13:36.639 align:start position:0%
implementation and and I would hate to
 
01:13:41.030 --> 01:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
see that ruin yes okay uh represent did
 
01:13:42.629 --> 01:13:42.639 align:start position:0%
you want to respond to her yeah no I was
 
01:13:45.750 --> 01:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
just saying I think I think again I
 
01:13:46.870 --> 01:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
actually don't have an opinion whether
 
01:13:49.110 --> 01:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
we should or not I am just curious but I
 
01:13:51.790 --> 01:13:51.800 align:start position:0%
think if the idea is making money for
 
01:13:53.790 --> 01:13:53.800 align:start position:0%
the state then there is an there is an
 
01:13:55.270 --> 01:13:55.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity cost that we're giving up
 
01:13:56.629 --> 01:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
and it's whether whether or not that
 
01:13:58.390 --> 01:13:58.400 align:start position:0%
would be greater so for example let's
 
01:14:00.310 --> 01:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
say the number thrown out there was we
 
01:14:02.229 --> 01:14:02.239 align:start position:0%
could sell it or privatize it and
 
01:14:04.430 --> 01:14:04.440 align:start position:0%
somehow gain a billion dollars put that
 
01:14:06.350 --> 01:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
billion dollars into a fund that kicks
 
01:14:09.350 --> 01:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
off I don't know $50 million a year or
 
01:14:13.550 --> 01:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
something forever um that that might be
 
01:14:15.270 --> 01:14:15.280 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm not saying that it would be
 
01:14:16.590 --> 01:14:16.600 align:start position:0%
you're looking at me as if I've come to
 
01:14:18.669 --> 01:14:18.679 align:start position:0%
a predetermined conclus I'm just saying
 
01:14:21.550 --> 01:14:21.560 align:start position:0%
there are opport my point is there are
 
01:14:24.830 --> 01:14:24.840 align:start position:0%
opportunities that haven't been explored
 
01:14:26.550 --> 01:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
and that's all I'm saying you know when
 
01:14:28.270 --> 01:14:28.280 align:start position:0%
you talk about killing the Golden Goose
 
01:14:30.629 --> 01:14:30.639 align:start position:0%
well the Golden Goose might be hey like
 
01:14:33.510 --> 01:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
maybe the liquor industry is collapsing
 
01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
and and in 20 years we're look back at
 
01:14:36.629 --> 01:14:36.639 align:start position:0%
and say wow we don't get anything from
 
01:14:38.070 --> 01:14:38.080 align:start position:0%
alcohol anymore because nobody consumes
 
01:14:40.550 --> 01:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
it anymore and we could have cashed out
 
01:14:42.590 --> 01:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
got a billion dollars back in
 
01:14:46.189 --> 01:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
2025 and put it into a into some sort of
 
01:14:47.990 --> 01:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
state fund that just kicks off interest
 
01:14:49.830 --> 01:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
every year I mean all I'm saying those
 
01:14:51.750 --> 01:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
are the types of things a commission
 
01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
should study to understand what they are
 
01:14:55.910 --> 01:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
without actually coming in with a a
 
01:14:58.550 --> 01:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
conclusion that status quo is the best
 
01:14:59.870 --> 01:14:59.880 align:start position:0%
maybe it is the best and hopefully it
 
01:15:01.390 --> 01:15:01.400 align:start position:0%
would come up with whether it is or
 
01:15:03.750 --> 01:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
isn't is all I'm saying just in in
 
01:15:05.550 --> 01:15:05.560 align:start position:0%
coming up with that whoever threw out
 
01:15:07.390 --> 01:15:07.400 align:start position:0%
that billion dollar number I'm not
 
01:15:08.870 --> 01:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
saying it's good or bad I'm just saying
 
01:15:10.629 --> 01:15:10.639 align:start position:0%
look at the size of our state let's be
 
01:15:13.310 --> 01:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
realistic is somebody going to buy you
 
01:15:15.189 --> 01:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
know I mean if you're going to it just
 
01:15:17.550 --> 01:15:17.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't I okay maybe the billion dollars
 
01:15:19.910 --> 01:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
is not I'm just saying for it it might
 
01:15:21.990 --> 01:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
very well be unreasonable that could be
 
01:15:23.709 --> 01:15:23.719 align:start position:0%
figured out like I could probably figure
 
01:15:25.510 --> 01:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
out a rough estimate of what would be if
 
01:15:26.790 --> 01:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
I just went through their books right
 
01:15:28.070 --> 01:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
like that's kind of an accounting
 
01:15:31.070 --> 01:15:31.080 align:start position:0%
process that could be done um they have
 
01:15:32.470 --> 01:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
great real estate there's probably some
 
01:15:33.750 --> 01:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
value in that I know they don't own all
 
01:15:34.830 --> 01:15:34.840 align:start position:0%
of it but they own some of it like
 
01:15:37.550 --> 01:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of different assets there
 
01:15:40.189 --> 01:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
that a a thorough study which probably
 
01:15:41.669 --> 01:15:41.679 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be done I think John's probably
 
01:15:42.830 --> 01:15:42.840 align:start position:0%
right it would have to be an outside
 
01:15:44.950 --> 01:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
study not a it would cost hundreds of
 
01:15:46.830 --> 01:15:46.840 align:start position:0%
thousands of doll cost maybe you should
 
01:15:48.390 --> 01:15:48.400 align:start position:0%
hire me to do it I'm an economist I do
 
01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:49.550 align:start position:0%
hire me to do it I'm an economist I do
these

01:15:49.550 --> 01:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:15:52.629 --> 01:15:52.639 align:start position:0%
sorts um you have a conflict yeah very
 
01:15:54.629 --> 01:15:54.639 align:start position:0%
much so but uh yeah no I mean that's
 
01:15:55.870 --> 01:15:55.880 align:start position:0%
what I'm
 
01:15:57.629 --> 01:15:57.639 align:start position:0%
there this is an interesting question is
 
01:15:59.550 --> 01:15:59.560 align:start position:0%
my point yes do we do it through a
 
01:16:01.910 --> 01:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
commission probably not if we if we're
 
01:16:04.030 --> 01:16:04.040 align:start position:0%
serious about exploring this idea or if
 
01:16:07.229 --> 01:16:07.239 align:start position:0%
the sponsors are I'm not on this this
 
01:16:09.790 --> 01:16:09.800 align:start position:0%
bill um I wouldn't have joined this this
 
01:16:11.390 --> 01:16:11.400 align:start position:0%
sponsorship because I don't think that
 
01:16:13.070 --> 01:16:13.080 align:start position:0%
this would be the right way to do it but
 
01:16:14.510 --> 01:16:14.520 align:start position:0%
I do like the idea that somebody's
 
01:16:16.750 --> 01:16:16.760 align:start position:0%
talking about exploring Alternatives
 
01:16:19.189 --> 01:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
because we don't actually know if this
 
01:16:20.669 --> 01:16:20.679 align:start position:0%
is the best outcome we're sticking with
 
01:16:22.669 --> 01:16:22.679 align:start position:0%
the status quo bias because that's what
 
01:16:24.430 --> 01:16:24.440 align:start position:0%
humans do we like the status quo we're
 
01:16:26.629 --> 01:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
comfortable with it um but there might
 
01:16:28.669 --> 01:16:28.679 align:start position:0%
devil we know the devil we know right
 
01:16:31.030 --> 01:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
and and but you know it's possible the
 
01:16:32.470 --> 01:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
devil we don't know is better and we
 
01:16:35.070 --> 01:16:35.080 align:start position:0%
won't know that unless we studied it so
 
01:16:36.750 --> 01:16:36.760 align:start position:0%
with that I will stop talking
 
01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:38.669 align:start position:0%
with that I will stop talking
representative

01:16:38.669 --> 01:16:38.679 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:16:40.950 --> 01:16:40.960 align:start position:0%
baros um I just want to say that it
 
01:16:43.030 --> 01:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
seemed like for the people who were in
 
01:16:45.350 --> 01:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
favor of this commission one of their
 
01:16:48.950 --> 01:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
main concerns was the sale of liquor
 
01:16:51.510 --> 01:16:51.520 align:start position:0%
going down so I don't think the answer
 
01:16:53.629 --> 01:16:53.639 align:start position:0%
to that is privatization I think it's
 
01:16:55.629 --> 01:16:55.639 align:start position:0%
looking at the marketing plan and it's
 
01:16:57.830 --> 01:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
looking at the the product mix I mean
 
01:16:59.070 --> 01:16:59.080 align:start position:0%
there was just an article in the New
 
01:17:01.229 --> 01:17:01.239 align:start position:0%
York Times about how non-alcoholic
 
01:17:03.830 --> 01:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
beverages sell those is soaring a lot of
 
01:17:06.790 --> 01:17:06.800 align:start position:0%
them are sold in Liquor Stores um I'm
 
01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
not a big drinker we found a
 
01:17:10.510 --> 01:17:10.520 align:start position:0%
non-alcoholic wine that is absolutely
 
01:17:13.110 --> 01:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
amazing so I think that it's more of a
 
01:17:15.470 --> 01:17:15.480 align:start position:0%
marketing issue and and planning issue
 
01:17:18.149 --> 01:17:18.159 align:start position:0%
than just dismantling the whole thing
 
01:17:20.750 --> 01:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
which basically seems to be working so
 
01:17:22.709 --> 01:17:22.719 align:start position:0%
that's my
 
01:17:25.750 --> 01:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
thought any other disc representative
 
01:17:28.950 --> 01:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
pus thank you chairman hun uh I'd like
 
01:17:31.350 --> 01:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
to get back to the subject of the bill
 
01:17:33.070 --> 01:17:33.080 align:start position:0%
it says establishing a commission to
 
01:17:35.229 --> 01:17:35.239 align:start position:0%
study the
 
01:17:38.510 --> 01:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
privatization not the marketing or
 
01:17:41.629 --> 01:17:41.639 align:start position:0%
anything else of Liquor Commission so I
 
01:17:43.990 --> 01:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
would like to move
 
01:17:48.189 --> 01:17:48.199 align:start position:0%
itl okay moving right along okay all
 
01:17:48.199 --> 01:17:49.470 align:start position:0%
itl okay moving right along okay all
right

01:17:49.470 --> 01:17:49.480 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:51.310 align:start position:0%
right
so

01:17:51.310 --> 01:17:51.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:17:56.750 --> 01:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:59.510 --> 01:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
second by representative hunt moves
 
01:18:01.390 --> 01:18:01.400 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate any discussion
 
01:18:02.390 --> 01:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
on the
 
01:18:04.950 --> 01:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
motion yes representative
 
01:18:08.830 --> 01:18:08.840 align:start position:0%
Walts if it ain't broke don't fix it
 
01:18:11.669 --> 01:18:11.679 align:start position:0%
well I mean I don't I would
 
01:18:15.189 --> 01:18:15.199 align:start position:0%
say um when I first got elected they
 
01:18:18.030 --> 01:18:18.040 align:start position:0%
used to have a rule that
 
01:18:21.910 --> 01:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
um that that all rules had to be R had
 
01:18:26.590 --> 01:18:26.600 align:start position:0%
to be reviewed every so often okay and
 
01:18:27.990 --> 01:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
that and then and the same thing was
 
01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:28.750 align:start position:0%
that and then and the same thing was
with

01:18:28.750 --> 01:18:28.760 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:18:31.709 --> 01:18:31.719 align:start position:0%
departments that every Department had to
 
01:18:34.830 --> 01:18:34.840 align:start position:0%
we we would review the the role of that
 
01:18:36.830 --> 01:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
department and and really feel see
 
01:18:39.550 --> 01:18:39.560 align:start position:0%
whether they're doing it right or doing
 
01:18:40.990 --> 01:18:41.000 align:start position:0%
and eventually we got rid of that
 
01:18:42.470 --> 01:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
because it just seemed like a real
 
01:18:44.709 --> 01:18:44.719 align:start position:0%
burden and nothing ever no one ever
 
01:18:46.270 --> 01:18:46.280 align:start position:0%
change because everybody kind of stuck
 
01:18:49.070 --> 01:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
with the devil they knew um I think in
 
01:18:51.430 --> 01:18:51.440 align:start position:0%
terms of the the role of our Liquor
 
01:18:53.470 --> 01:18:53.480 align:start position:0%
Commission is clearly we have a very
 
01:18:55.629 --> 01:18:55.639 align:start position:0%
successful Liquor Commission as control
 
01:19:00.470 --> 01:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
States go and and and but that I think
 
01:19:03.229 --> 01:19:03.239 align:start position:0%
that um right now this is like the worst
 
01:19:06.350 --> 01:19:06.360 align:start position:0%
sign to be doing it because um our
 
01:19:09.149 --> 01:19:09.159 align:start position:0%
number one source of customers that are
 
01:19:11.430 --> 01:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
outside the state of New Hampshire um
 
01:19:13.750 --> 01:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
they changed the rules and they decided
 
01:19:15.790 --> 01:19:15.800 align:start position:0%
that they're going to go with one big
 
01:19:18.390 --> 01:19:18.400 align:start position:0%
company which when we did the marijuana
 
01:19:19.750 --> 01:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
commission that was one of the fears
 
01:19:22.149 --> 01:19:22.159 align:start position:0%
that people didn't like the idea that
 
01:19:24.310 --> 01:19:24.320 align:start position:0%
that you would concentration of of
 
01:19:27.470 --> 01:19:27.480 align:start position:0%
wealth and store store power be in one
 
01:19:29.470 --> 01:19:29.480 align:start position:0%
individual company in this case
 
01:19:30.790 --> 01:19:30.800 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and I'm not going to
 
01:19:33.790 --> 01:19:33.800 align:start position:0%
mention names again but in terms of that
 
01:19:37.070 --> 01:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
they have uh dramatically changed our
 
01:19:38.669 --> 01:19:38.679 align:start position:0%
customers that they are not coming up
 
01:19:40.990 --> 01:19:41.000 align:start position:0%
from Massachusetts because they can just
 
01:19:44.910 --> 01:19:44.920 align:start position:0%
go to Shrewsberry or go to Brockton or
 
01:19:46.990 --> 01:19:47.000 align:start position:0%
all these other major metropolitan areas
 
01:19:49.110 --> 01:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts and and get the same
 
01:19:53.070 --> 01:19:53.080 align:start position:0%
pricing we have um so that changes
 
01:19:54.430 --> 01:19:54.440 align:start position:0%
things and then when you throw in the
 
01:19:56.590 --> 01:19:56.600 align:start position:0%
fact that we have dry January and we
 
01:19:59.270 --> 01:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
have the rise of non-alcohol and and
 
01:20:02.149 --> 01:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
then it's to me it's like every every
 
01:20:04.590 --> 01:20:04.600 align:start position:0%
week it's another Brewer who's going out
 
01:20:06.950 --> 01:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
of business I mean it's just you know
 
01:20:08.830 --> 01:20:08.840 align:start position:0%
it's it's you know the the mar Market
 
01:20:10.709 --> 01:20:10.719 align:start position:0%
was saturated so things are really
 
01:20:13.709 --> 01:20:13.719 align:start position:0%
changing and I to me the idea that we
 
01:20:15.709 --> 01:20:15.719 align:start position:0%
should change our model now it seems
 
01:20:19.709 --> 01:20:19.719 align:start position:0%
like a bad timing to me but I think that
 
01:20:22.070 --> 01:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
um I certainly liked having this
 
01:20:24.470 --> 01:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
discussion in our committee I think we
 
01:20:26.709 --> 01:20:26.719 align:start position:0%
uh you know we can be fair and discuss
 
01:20:29.669 --> 01:20:29.679 align:start position:0%
it and and uh but
 
01:20:32.550 --> 01:20:32.560 align:start position:0%
then it was even a disagreement upon
 
01:20:35.310 --> 01:20:35.320 align:start position:0%
between the sponsors on what they wanted
 
01:20:37.550 --> 01:20:37.560 align:start position:0%
out of the committee and and one of the
 
01:20:39.110 --> 01:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
sponsors didn't want to privatize at all
 
01:20:41.390 --> 01:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
she she wanted she just wanted to bring
 
01:20:44.830 --> 01:20:44.840 align:start position:0%
back the old system we had in which in
 
01:20:46.870 --> 01:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
which the the finance committee had more
 
01:20:49.830 --> 01:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
control over the commission so
 
01:20:53.510 --> 01:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
um at this point I I I do agree with
 
01:20:56.590 --> 01:20:56.600 align:start position:0%
that we should not pass it is buil
 
01:21:01.070 --> 01:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
today yes absolutely um in thinking
 
01:21:03.350 --> 01:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
about this the uh Governor just
 
01:21:07.470 --> 01:21:07.480 align:start position:0%
established a committee to look all the
 
01:21:11.390 --> 01:21:11.400 align:start position:0%
um all the agencies and this you know if
 
01:21:13.750 --> 01:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
they go through the agencies this may
 
01:21:16.470 --> 01:21:16.480 align:start position:0%
especially because it begins with a um
 
01:21:19.950 --> 01:21:19.960 align:start position:0%
they they may actually you know look at
 
01:21:22.629 --> 01:21:22.639 align:start position:0%
uh this possibility or try to do some
 
01:21:25.390 --> 01:21:25.400 align:start position:0%
cost benefit analysis and perhaps they
 
01:21:28.030 --> 01:21:28.040 align:start position:0%
would make a recommendation out of that
 
01:21:29.750 --> 01:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh commission maybe that's something
 
01:21:32.270 --> 01:21:32.280 align:start position:0%
that could be recommended to them but I
 
01:21:35.270 --> 01:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
think it might happen by default right
 
01:21:37.790 --> 01:21:37.800 align:start position:0%
but it is an a they'll start with L this
 
01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:39.149 align:start position:0%
but it is an a they'll start with L this
they're

01:21:39.149 --> 01:21:39.159 align:start position:0%
they're
 
01:21:42.070 --> 01:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
L okay is the motion clear of
 
01:21:43.590 --> 01:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to
 
01:21:45.910 --> 01:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
legislate any any discussion on the
 
01:21:48.070 --> 01:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
motion seeing none all those in favor
 
01:21:51.750 --> 01:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
please raise your hand one two three
 
01:21:58.229 --> 01:21:58.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:00.870 --> 01:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
okay all
 
01:22:06.870 --> 01:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:09.830 --> 01:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
least okay removing the requirement that
 
01:22:13.430 --> 01:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
on premise lcy serve food okay so the
 
01:22:16.990 --> 01:22:17.000 align:start position:0%
sponsor is here um just so you know I'm

sharing uh other things that you would
 
01:22:32.149 --> 01:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
hope to have come up my first question
 
01:22:34.669 --> 01:22:34.679 align:start position:0%
is did you watch the Youtube on the
 
01:22:36.990 --> 01:22:37.000 align:start position:0%
hearing I did okay so let's say you're
 
01:22:38.950 --> 01:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
you're responding to what you saw on the
 
01:22:41.310 --> 01:22:41.320 align:start position:0%
YouTube yes so so I won't really get
 
01:22:43.669 --> 01:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
into a testify I'm uh representative
 
01:22:45.590 --> 01:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
hemway freshman of my m at Claremont
 
01:22:49.229 --> 01:22:49.239 align:start position:0%
District Six uh Claremont Cy as my
 
01:22:51.110 --> 01:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
Representatives um so this was brought
 
01:22:55.629 --> 01:22:55.639 align:start position:0%
to me um by the city
 
01:23:01.110 --> 01:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
uh in a way that would improve young um
 
01:23:03.629 --> 01:23:03.639 align:start position:0%
retention young adult
 
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
retention because as it is right now
 
01:23:08.550 --> 01:23:08.560 align:start position:0%
there is no night life for them to stay
 
01:23:10.910 --> 01:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
around in this area they they go to
 
01:23:13.229 --> 01:23:13.239 align:start position:0%
school right out of out of high school
 
01:23:15.510 --> 01:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
or they go to college and then they they
 
01:23:17.870 --> 01:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
take off and then they go to places
 
01:23:21.310 --> 01:23:21.320 align:start position:0%
where there's something that's for them
 
01:23:25.550 --> 01:23:25.560 align:start position:0%
to do in the evenings 9:00 10:
 
01:23:29.669 --> 01:23:29.679 align:start position:0%
most places most cities uh towns uh the
 
01:23:31.110 --> 01:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
streets are rolled up there's nothing
 
01:23:33.229 --> 01:23:33.239 align:start position:0%
out there I remember back in the 80s
 
01:23:36.510 --> 01:23:36.520 align:start position:0%
when I was when I was uh 17 years old
 
01:23:39.790 --> 01:23:39.800 align:start position:0%
there was uh we had
 
01:23:41.990 --> 01:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
nightclubs of course they was still tied
 
01:23:45.390 --> 01:23:45.400 align:start position:0%
to Food Service but they had nightclubs
 
01:23:47.990 --> 01:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
they had U and if it wasn't in New
 
01:23:49.709 --> 01:23:49.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we'd go to
 
01:23:55.030 --> 01:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
Vermont at 17 no so uh but
 
01:23:56.350 --> 01:23:56.360 align:start position:0%
and that's what's happening right now
 
01:23:58.790 --> 01:23:58.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire people were losing that
 
01:24:00.830 --> 01:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
Revenue because they're going to Vermont
 
01:24:02.110 --> 01:24:02.120 align:start position:0%
they're going to Maine they're going to
 
01:24:03.950 --> 01:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
massachus and that's where they're
 
01:24:07.030 --> 01:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
they're having their night life so this
 
01:24:10.669 --> 01:24:10.679 align:start position:0%
isn't more about just drinking and
 
01:24:13.310 --> 01:24:13.320 align:start position:0%
getting smashed and and you know uh
 
01:24:15.310 --> 01:24:15.320 align:start position:0%
getting fights this is about having a
 
01:24:18.750 --> 01:24:18.760 align:start position:0%
social environment for the young adults
 
01:24:21.950 --> 01:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
and mid mid-age uh adults to have a
 
01:24:24.590 --> 01:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
place to go socialize maybe listen some
 
01:24:26.870 --> 01:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
music get out and have a dance or
 
01:24:28.590 --> 01:24:28.600 align:start position:0%
whatever so this this is the premise of
 
01:24:30.669 --> 01:24:30.679 align:start position:0%
this build basically is just
 
01:24:30.679 --> 01:24:32.229 align:start position:0%
this build basically is just
to

01:24:32.229 --> 01:24:32.239 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:24:35.350 --> 01:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
tourism adult uh retention in New
 
01:24:37.430 --> 01:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because right now uh we're
 
01:24:39.629 --> 01:24:39.639 align:start position:0%
still we're increasing in some young
 
01:24:44.550 --> 01:24:44.560 align:start position:0%
adults but our our elderly the 60 65 my
 
01:24:46.870 --> 01:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
age are still overrunning that young
 
01:24:48.950 --> 01:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
adult age and we need to have that young
 
01:24:51.590 --> 01:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
youth to manage our businesses and our
 
01:24:54.430 --> 01:24:54.440 align:start position:0%
our Industries and bring the population
 
01:24:56.350 --> 01:24:56.360 align:start position:0%
back up to where it needs to
 
01:25:00.189 --> 01:25:00.199 align:start position:0%
be uh so I have some good news for you
 
01:25:04.070 --> 01:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
um after 9:00 there is no food
 
01:25:06.990 --> 01:25:07.000 align:start position:0%
requirement okay I I did not see that in
 
01:25:10.270 --> 01:25:10.280 align:start position:0%
the bill that's no that's in the current
 
01:25:13.189 --> 01:25:13.199 align:start position:0%
law yeah yeah current law current law
 
01:25:14.790 --> 01:25:14.800 align:start position:0%
that there's that the food requirement
 
01:25:18.350 --> 01:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
disappears at night okay however they
 
01:25:20.709 --> 01:25:20.719 align:start position:0%
still have to provide
 
01:25:24.070 --> 01:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
food prior to that even while that's
 
01:25:26.229 --> 01:25:26.239 align:start position:0%
open open to my understanding is they
 
01:25:28.830 --> 01:25:28.840 align:start position:0%
still need to provide food no after they
 
01:25:31.350 --> 01:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
don't have to provide as long as it
 
01:25:33.790 --> 01:25:33.800 align:start position:0%
$75,000 for the year know that's the
 
01:25:37.270 --> 01:25:37.280 align:start position:0%
establish that's to be a lensee so one
 
01:25:38.990 --> 01:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
of the testimony I know you since you
 
01:25:41.430 --> 01:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
heard it was that um we had a testimony
 
01:25:44.030 --> 01:25:44.040 align:start position:0%
from Mike Hummers who said that frankly
 
01:25:46.470 --> 01:25:46.480 align:start position:0%
food is not particularly
 
01:25:50.669 --> 01:25:50.679 align:start position:0%
profitable and so therefore um you know
 
01:25:54.390 --> 01:25:54.400 align:start position:0%
they having having the ability for them
 
01:25:56.629 --> 01:25:56.639 align:start position:0%
not you know to stay open late without
 
01:25:58.510 --> 01:25:58.520 align:start position:0%
having to serve food is would be a good
 
01:26:00.990 --> 01:26:01.000 align:start position:0%
thing right that can help bring in the
 
01:26:03.830 --> 01:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
profitability uh but that you know that
 
01:26:06.229 --> 01:26:06.239 align:start position:0%
um so what you're proposing is that
 
01:26:08.830 --> 01:26:08.840 align:start position:0%
people in Claremont would like to see an
 
01:26:11.430 --> 01:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
establishment that would be open prior
 
01:26:16.709 --> 01:26:16.719 align:start position:0%
to 9:00 yes and and be theoretically
 
01:26:21.510 --> 01:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
only served liquor correct and did the
 
01:26:24.470 --> 01:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
restaurants in Claremont know that the
 
01:26:27.270 --> 01:26:27.280 align:start position:0%
was being proposed I have not talked to
 
01:26:29.590 --> 01:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
the restaurants right did did talk to
 
01:26:31.790 --> 01:26:31.800 align:start position:0%
several other people within the right
 
01:26:33.830 --> 01:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
around about how how would you feel if
 
01:26:36.229 --> 01:26:36.239 align:start position:0%
you were a restaurant owner and all of a
 
01:26:38.510 --> 01:26:38.520 align:start position:0%
sudden a bar opened next door that
 
01:26:40.709 --> 01:26:40.719 align:start position:0%
didn't have a food requirement I was a
 
01:26:44.109 --> 01:26:44.119 align:start position:0%
restaurant owner in Claremont yeah and
 
01:26:45.709 --> 01:26:45.719 align:start position:0%
we had the we had the requirement to
 
01:26:48.149 --> 01:26:48.159 align:start position:0%
have food same as everybody else right
 
01:26:51.510 --> 01:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
um I think that if you were to allow a
 
01:26:53.590 --> 01:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
restaurant to come in you would have
 
01:26:55.870 --> 01:26:55.880 align:start position:0%
that mix of this would not be a
 
01:26:57.790 --> 01:26:57.800 align:start position:0%
restaurant you we're allowing excuse
 
01:26:59.790 --> 01:26:59.800 align:start position:0%
we're allowing the bar right so if you
 
01:27:02.870 --> 01:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
allow bar to come in thank you if we
 
01:27:05.990 --> 01:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
allowed a bar to come in and I think it
 
01:27:08.790 --> 01:27:08.800 align:start position:0%
would complement the restaurant because
 
01:27:11.310 --> 01:27:11.320 align:start position:0%
if they're there at uh you know 5:00 in
 
01:27:12.990 --> 01:27:13.000 align:start position:0%
the afternoon you want to get something
 
01:27:14.030 --> 01:27:14.040 align:start position:0%
to eat they'll come over to your
 
01:27:15.990 --> 01:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
establishment they'll eat and then maybe
 
01:27:17.550 --> 01:27:17.560 align:start position:0%
they'll go back to the bar they'll sit
 
01:27:20.910 --> 01:27:20.920 align:start position:0%
at your bar and have it have some food
 
01:27:24.510 --> 01:27:24.520 align:start position:0%
but it does create you know downtown CL
 
01:27:28.270 --> 01:27:28.280 align:start position:0%
is dead yes right so and we're trying to
 
01:27:30.790 --> 01:27:30.800 align:start position:0%
revitalize it so a way to revitalize It
 
01:27:34.590 --> 01:27:34.600 align:start position:0%
Is by either putting in little food
 
01:27:37.669 --> 01:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
establishments in there Andor having the
 
01:27:41.390 --> 01:27:41.400 align:start position:0%
ability to have a individual bar in
 
01:27:43.550 --> 01:27:43.560 align:start position:0%
there it's going to bring more people
 
01:27:45.550 --> 01:27:45.560 align:start position:0%
it's a walking environment on on that
 
01:27:47.830 --> 01:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
street and it would be great opportunity
 
01:27:50.990 --> 01:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
for those little niche uh businesses to
 
01:27:52.229 --> 01:27:52.239 align:start position:0%
fit in
 
01:27:56.030 --> 01:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
there fair enough representative
 
01:27:58.790 --> 01:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
BR thank you I mean is there any concern
 
01:28:01.189 --> 01:28:01.199 align:start position:0%
about I mean it's been documented that
 
01:28:03.950 --> 01:28:03.960 align:start position:0%
when people drink without eating their
 
01:28:06.229 --> 01:28:06.239 align:start position:0%
level of intoxication goes up more
 
01:28:08.350 --> 01:28:08.360 align:start position:0%
rapidly and so I'm concerned about
 
01:28:10.470 --> 01:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
driving and that kind of thing so is
 
01:28:13.950 --> 01:28:13.960 align:start position:0%
there have you thought about that aspect
 
01:28:16.270 --> 01:28:16.280 align:start position:0%
yes representative burough uh so with
 
01:28:18.470 --> 01:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
that we also provide two taxi companies
 
01:28:20.149 --> 01:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
in there there's Ubers and everything in
 
01:28:23.109 --> 01:28:23.119 align:start position:0%
there that proximity of there is is
 
01:28:26.830 --> 01:28:26.840 align:start position:0%
close proximity to a lot of uh housing
 
01:28:29.790 --> 01:28:29.800 align:start position:0%
in that area I'm probably less than a
 
01:28:32.550 --> 01:28:32.560 align:start position:0%
mile from where where most of that
 
01:28:35.669 --> 01:28:35.679 align:start position:0%
activity would take place I would walk
 
01:28:38.030 --> 01:28:38.040 align:start position:0%
um I know a lot of other people that
 
01:28:41.470 --> 01:28:41.480 align:start position:0%
walk to either the El allegion you know
 
01:28:43.310 --> 01:28:43.320 align:start position:0%
uh so that they don't have to worry
 
01:28:46.750 --> 01:28:46.760 align:start position:0%
about the driving piece um so
 
01:28:49.310 --> 01:28:49.320 align:start position:0%
yes there was represent
 
01:28:52.229 --> 01:28:52.239 align:start position:0%
hwood well excuse me uh thanks for
 
01:28:53.709 --> 01:28:53.719 align:start position:0%
coming in I'm the one who presented your
 
01:28:56.590 --> 01:28:56.600 align:start position:0%
bill last week or whatever it was um I
 
01:28:59.030 --> 01:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
mean I listen I everybody here knows I'm
 
01:29:01.149 --> 01:29:01.159 align:start position:0%
on board with this I put in a similar
 
01:29:05.189 --> 01:29:05.199 align:start position:0%
but much less aggressive Bill last year
 
01:29:08.470 --> 01:29:08.480 align:start position:0%
to try to do to move in this direction
 
01:29:11.270 --> 01:29:11.280 align:start position:0%
um and I and I actually I I really do
 
01:29:13.830 --> 01:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
agree with the idea that New Hampshire
 
01:29:16.470 --> 01:29:16.480 align:start position:0%
has it's like it's like a slow moving
 
01:29:18.109 --> 01:29:18.119 align:start position:0%
train wreck that we can see coming in
 
01:29:19.790 --> 01:29:19.800 align:start position:0%
terms of our demographic problem here we
 
01:29:21.310 --> 01:29:21.320 align:start position:0%
have the lowest birth rate in the
 
01:29:23.430 --> 01:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
country we have the second oldest
 
01:29:26.750 --> 01:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
population the country and what I hear
 
01:29:27.790 --> 01:29:27.800 align:start position:0%
over and over again is that New
 
01:29:29.830 --> 01:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is boring and I think we need
 
01:29:32.070 --> 01:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
to make New Hampshire fun for younger
 
01:29:33.830 --> 01:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
people and there's a reason why no it's
 
01:29:36.070 --> 01:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
true I mean people come here on vacation
 
01:29:37.750 --> 01:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
when I lived in Boston I I I used to
 
01:29:39.270 --> 01:29:39.280 align:start position:0%
come up here to go skiing and go go to
 
01:29:40.510 --> 01:29:40.520 align:start position:0%
my lakes and stuff like that but I
 
01:29:42.109 --> 01:29:42.119 align:start position:0%
wouldn't come up here and be like oh
 
01:29:43.590 --> 01:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
let's do a night out here like you would
 
01:29:46.709 --> 01:29:46.719 align:start position:0%
in Portland OR Burlington or Providence
 
01:29:49.750 --> 01:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
whatever so um sounds like a will you
 
01:29:51.950 --> 01:29:51.960 align:start position:0%
believe but
 
01:29:55.109 --> 01:29:55.119 align:start position:0%
uh my my question is just is a
 
01:29:56.709 --> 01:29:56.719 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so you don't have to worry
 
01:29:58.950 --> 01:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
there there not a hear good you it can
 
01:30:01.229 --> 01:30:01.239 align:start position:0%
be an interactive conversation perfect
 
01:30:06.550 --> 01:30:06.560 align:start position:0%
um thank you uh yeah so um have you do
 
01:30:09.270 --> 01:30:09.280 align:start position:0%
you have do you know anybody who is I
 
01:30:11.430 --> 01:30:11.440 align:start position:0%
mean it would be great if we I I know
 
01:30:13.350 --> 01:30:13.360 align:start position:0%
people who would support this and I I
 
01:30:15.229 --> 01:30:15.239 align:start position:0%
think that our job on the Commerce
 
01:30:17.229 --> 01:30:17.239 align:start position:0%
Committee is not to Simply entrench the
 
01:30:19.629 --> 01:30:19.639 align:start position:0%
incumbents but rather to tear down walls
 
01:30:23.750 --> 01:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
to allow new businesses to thrive um
 
01:30:25.750 --> 01:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
have you do you have people like you
 
01:30:27.470 --> 01:30:27.480 align:start position:0%
said the city came to you is that like
 
01:30:29.470 --> 01:30:29.480 align:start position:0%
the city counselor or is that a mayor
 
01:30:31.629 --> 01:30:31.639 align:start position:0%
like who came to you just people who
 
01:30:34.550 --> 01:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
live in the town the manager the manager
 
01:30:36.189 --> 01:30:36.199 align:start position:0%
okay so the city manager came to you and
 
01:30:38.149 --> 01:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
thought of this as an idea okay so it is
 
01:30:39.950 --> 01:30:39.960 align:start position:0%
coming so he must be hearing it from
 
01:30:42.229 --> 01:30:42.239 align:start position:0%
somebody in his community uh he's he's
 
01:30:45.510 --> 01:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
talked to Lebanon Portsmith Keane
 
01:30:49.830 --> 01:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
NASA and all these are favorable for
 
01:30:52.990 --> 01:30:53.000 align:start position:0%
this AC yeah okay and that that's
 
01:30:54.550 --> 01:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
interesting because I
 
01:30:56.709 --> 01:30:56.719 align:start position:0%
think I'm going to tell you right now
 
01:30:58.350 --> 01:30:58.360 align:start position:0%
you got some hurdles to get this through
 
01:31:00.350 --> 01:31:00.360 align:start position:0%
I mean I I support it even if it gets
 
01:31:01.430 --> 01:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
out of the house it probably won't go
 
01:31:04.390 --> 01:31:04.400 align:start position:0%
much further but I I think that um I
 
01:31:07.709 --> 01:31:07.719 align:start position:0%
think that I commend you for doing this
 
01:31:10.470 --> 01:31:10.480 align:start position:0%
work knowing that it probably won't get
 
01:31:12.070 --> 01:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
signed into law this year even if it
 
01:31:13.950 --> 01:31:13.960 align:start position:0%
gets out of the house I would uh
 
01:31:16.030 --> 01:31:16.040 align:start position:0%
encourage you to and I'll work with you
 
01:31:17.950 --> 01:31:17.960 align:start position:0%
to try to build more of a coalition to
 
01:31:19.350 --> 01:31:19.360 align:start position:0%
try to get this going because I I think
 
01:31:21.669 --> 01:31:21.679 align:start position:0%
this is where New Hampshire needs to go
 
01:31:24.750 --> 01:31:24.760 align:start position:0%
I think um you know I've lived in cities
 
01:31:27.510 --> 01:31:27.520 align:start position:0%
that don't have these laws and they're
 
01:31:30.870 --> 01:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
not coming apart at the seams um and I
 
01:31:33.229 --> 01:31:33.239 align:start position:0%
think I think it's
 
01:31:36.750 --> 01:31:36.760 align:start position:0%
oftentimes uh just the incumbent players
 
01:31:38.910 --> 01:31:38.920 align:start position:0%
who own a restaurant who think it's
 
01:31:41.070 --> 01:31:41.080 align:start position:0%
unfair that they've gone through one
 
01:31:43.830 --> 01:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
thing but we're not are just because we
 
01:31:45.669 --> 01:31:45.679 align:start position:0%
have a bad law in place that they maybe
 
01:31:47.590 --> 01:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have participated in a decade
 
01:31:49.189 --> 01:31:49.199 align:start position:0%
ago doesn't mean we shouldn't try to fix
 
01:31:51.149 --> 01:31:51.159 align:start position:0%
it now and make it better for the future
 
01:31:54.750 --> 01:31:54.760 align:start position:0%
otherwise we get stuck in this
 
01:31:58.030 --> 01:31:58.040 align:start position:0%
inferior uh solution if you will so uh
 
01:31:59.830 --> 01:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
happy to work with you in the future on
 
01:32:03.149 --> 01:32:03.159 align:start position:0%
this and in this process as well
 
01:32:03.159 --> 01:32:04.550 align:start position:0%
this and in this process as well
represent

01:32:04.550 --> 01:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:32:06.950 --> 01:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
Walsh thank you Mr
 
01:32:09.669 --> 01:32:09.679 align:start position:0%
chairman uh I am all for making New
 
01:32:11.350 --> 01:32:11.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire grade
 
01:32:15.310 --> 01:32:15.320 align:start position:0%
again uh had to get that in there I had
 
01:32:19.310 --> 01:32:19.320 align:start position:0%
a question on uh line
 
01:32:25.590 --> 01:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
26 uh section uh I believe it's 2
 
01:32:29.390 --> 01:32:29.400 align:start position:0%
A1 the line actually I'm sorry it's line
 
01:32:33.750 --> 01:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
30 on uh on the on the first page that
 
01:32:36.070 --> 01:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
says the dining room shall not however
 
01:32:38.590 --> 01:32:38.600 align:start position:0%
be used as a substitute for lounge
 
01:32:42.149 --> 01:32:42.159 align:start position:0%
operations I mean we have a lot of small
 
01:32:45.510 --> 01:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
restaurants throughout the state so you
 
01:32:47.709 --> 01:32:47.719 align:start position:0%
know with the intention of free
 
01:32:50.310 --> 01:32:50.320 align:start position:0%
enterprise free market situations I mean
 
01:32:52.910 --> 01:32:52.920 align:start position:0%
they they may have just one dining room
 
01:32:54.149 --> 01:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
and if they're looking for an
 
01:32:56.669 --> 01:32:56.679 align:start position:0%
opportunity to so you're you're looking
 
01:32:59.870 --> 01:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
at the current law okay yeah okay so in
 
01:33:03.030 --> 01:33:03.040 align:start position:0%
terms of what the bill does is the cross
 
01:33:08.189 --> 01:33:08.199 align:start position:0%
out starting on page uh one there's a a
 
01:33:10.430 --> 01:33:10.440 align:start position:0%
cross out at times as food is available
 
01:33:13.350 --> 01:33:13.360 align:start position:0%
cross out there and the cross out so his
 
01:33:16.350 --> 01:33:16.360 align:start position:0%
bill is the cross outs yes so it it
 
01:33:17.950 --> 01:33:17.960 align:start position:0%
would remove that requirement that they
 
01:33:20.070 --> 01:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
would Lounge right he's not adding
 
01:33:22.350 --> 01:33:22.360 align:start position:0%
anything new he's only Crossing out
 
01:33:24.910 --> 01:33:24.920 align:start position:0%
what's in the current law I get that but
 
01:33:27.669 --> 01:33:27.679 align:start position:0%
but this line is not crossed out that
 
01:33:30.109 --> 01:33:30.119 align:start position:0%
means it stays that that means it stays
 
01:33:32.229 --> 01:33:32.239 align:start position:0%
in the law that's Cent law and and I
 
01:33:34.790 --> 01:33:34.800 align:start position:0%
understand stays there I understand that
 
01:33:36.870 --> 01:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
but I'm you think it should go be
 
01:33:40.229 --> 01:33:40.239 align:start position:0%
deleted yes oh that's what I'm
 
01:33:45.790 --> 01:33:45.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:49.990 --> 01:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
out because there's a lot of small tiny
 
01:33:52.310 --> 01:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
restaurants throughout New Hampshire
 
01:33:54.750 --> 01:33:54.760 align:start position:0%
that may only have one dining room and
 
01:33:56.350 --> 01:33:56.360 align:start position:0%
so here it's saying the dining room
 
01:33:56.360 --> 01:33:57.510 align:start position:0%
so here it's saying the dining room
shall

01:33:57.510 --> 01:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
shall
 
01:34:02.229 --> 01:34:02.239 align:start position:0%
not be used as a substitute for lounge
 
01:34:04.830 --> 01:34:04.840 align:start position:0%
operations why not let it be used for
 
01:34:04.840 --> 01:34:07.030 align:start position:0%
operations why not let it be used for
lounge

01:34:07.030 --> 01:34:07.040 align:start position:0%
lounge
 
01:34:10.669 --> 01:34:10.679 align:start position:0%
operations uh I I guess I I missing yeah
 
01:34:10.679 --> 01:34:11.990 align:start position:0%
operations uh I I guess I I missing yeah
delve

01:34:11.990 --> 01:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
delve
 
01:34:14.550 --> 01:34:14.560 align:start position:0%
into at the full service concur with
 
01:34:17.390 --> 01:34:17.400 align:start position:0%
that the I think that's related to the
 
01:34:20.910 --> 01:34:20.920 align:start position:0%
full service license I I think that but
 
01:34:23.149 --> 01:34:23.159 align:start position:0%
that's that under our current law at 9
 
01:34:25.470 --> 01:34:25.480 align:start position:0%
o'clock that that that dining room can
 
01:34:28.510 --> 01:34:28.520 align:start position:0%
be a b right so after nine they can be
 
01:34:31.590 --> 01:34:31.600 align:start position:0%
used as a b in current law current law
 
01:34:34.310 --> 01:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
okay and that that's just set up so I
 
01:34:36.629 --> 01:34:36.639 align:start position:0%
believe and I always look at my
 
01:34:38.350 --> 01:34:38.360 align:start position:0%
enforcement but they seem to have their
 
01:34:39.510 --> 01:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
backs to
 
01:34:42.430 --> 01:34:42.440 align:start position:0%
me hello Liquor Commission we have a
 
01:34:43.790 --> 01:34:43.800 align:start position:0%
question I assume that's sex you don't
 
01:34:45.790 --> 01:34:45.800 align:start position:0%
have to come over just just say yes or
 
01:34:48.109 --> 01:34:48.119 align:start position:0%
no when I say things
 
01:34:50.709 --> 01:34:50.719 align:start position:0%
okay you say I'm all wrong and then you
 
01:34:53.229 --> 01:34:53.239 align:start position:0%
need to that I believe this this section
 
01:34:56.270 --> 01:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
that she's referring to is our license
 
01:34:58.550 --> 01:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
that for that full liquor license that
 
01:35:00.709 --> 01:35:00.719 align:start position:0%
will'll have the the dining room then
 
01:35:04.870 --> 01:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
can be serve just liquor after 9 o' okay
 
01:35:06.030 --> 01:35:06.040 align:start position:0%
that's just the that's just the
 
01:35:08.910 --> 01:35:08.920 align:start position:0%
description of the lensey so
 
01:35:11.070 --> 01:35:11.080 align:start position:0%
theoretically and we haven't that we
 
01:35:12.990 --> 01:35:13.000 align:start position:0%
haven't really even delved it into this
 
01:35:16.550 --> 01:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
bill the question is how much should
 
01:35:18.790 --> 01:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
that bar license
 
01:35:23.149 --> 01:35:23.159 align:start position:0%
be because um the last time I sponsored
 
01:35:25.109 --> 01:35:25.119 align:start position:0%
this legis
 
01:35:27.350 --> 01:35:27.360 align:start position:0%
uh the issue was that if you were going
 
01:35:29.430 --> 01:35:29.440 align:start position:0%
to just issue a bar if you're just going
 
01:35:33.310 --> 01:35:33.320 align:start position:0%
to create a bar bar um then this would
 
01:35:35.870 --> 01:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
uh need a an expensive license because
 
01:35:37.390 --> 01:35:37.400 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission would have to
 
01:35:40.750 --> 01:35:40.760 align:start position:0%
spend a little extra time sure on that
 
01:35:43.470 --> 01:35:43.480 align:start position:0%
facility and uh off the top of my head I
 
01:35:45.830 --> 01:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
believe the number was $10,000 license
 
01:35:47.910 --> 01:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
for the year okay so in other words
 
01:35:49.470 --> 01:35:49.480 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding that they we had to make
 
01:35:51.629 --> 01:35:51.639 align:start position:0%
up you know whether we're making up for
 
01:35:54.030 --> 01:35:54.040 align:start position:0%
the food but that the enforce ment
 
01:35:57.430 --> 01:35:57.440 align:start position:0%
division would say you are creating a
 
01:36:01.990 --> 01:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
magnet for uh people for being over
 
01:36:05.430 --> 01:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
served and that's why the issue was a
 
01:36:08.270 --> 01:36:08.280 align:start position:0%
high an expensive license I I I could
 
01:36:09.590 --> 01:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
probably see that for a larger
 
01:36:11.229 --> 01:36:11.239 align:start position:0%
establishment but for a for
 
01:36:13.270 --> 01:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
establishment that's that's maybe a
 
01:36:15.350 --> 01:36:15.360 align:start position:0%
th000 square feet or or 800 square feet
 
01:36:17.590 --> 01:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
a hole in the wall yep yep I think
 
01:36:20.109 --> 01:36:20.119 align:start position:0%
10,000 would be a little excessive that
 
01:36:22.390 --> 01:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
is true is
 
01:36:24.990 --> 01:36:25.000 align:start position:0%
true but
 
01:36:27.990 --> 01:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
okay so are you all said represent yep
 
01:36:31.229 --> 01:36:31.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:34.070 --> 01:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
spear we do a lot of mandating here from
 
01:36:36.430 --> 01:36:36.440 align:start position:0%
the state down to the municipalities why
 
01:36:38.750 --> 01:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
are we not considering even making this
 
01:36:41.070 --> 01:36:41.080 align:start position:0%
an option I don't know that every town
 
01:36:44.430 --> 01:36:44.440 align:start position:0%
necessarily wants to do it or feels that
 
01:36:46.390 --> 01:36:46.400 align:start position:0%
they can do it or feels that they've got
 
01:36:50.109 --> 01:36:50.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:52.669 --> 01:36:52.679 align:start position:0%
it police and and the rest of it the
 
01:36:54.070 --> 01:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
whole you know everything that goes
 
01:36:56.109 --> 01:36:56.119 align:start position:0%
along with that right well only to the
 
01:36:58.350 --> 01:36:58.360 align:start position:0%
extent to what as I described that the
 
01:37:00.350 --> 01:37:00.360 align:start position:0%
liquor enforcement I don't mean liquor
 
01:37:02.270 --> 01:37:02.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement I mean the DUI and all the
 
01:37:04.390 --> 01:37:04.400 align:start position:0%
rest of it and the taxi cabs and the and
 
01:37:06.350 --> 01:37:06.360 align:start position:0%
the Ubers and whatever I mean it should
 
01:37:09.270 --> 01:37:09.280 align:start position:0%
be optional it shouldn't be
 
01:37:11.990 --> 01:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
mandated uh I don't I don't know I don't
 
01:37:15.790 --> 01:37:15.800 align:start position:0%
know we mandate any of that you by by
 
01:37:17.189 --> 01:37:17.199 align:start position:0%
changing the law exactly the way it's
 
01:37:19.950 --> 01:37:19.960 align:start position:0%
written so to enable a community to say
 
01:37:24.030 --> 01:37:24.040 align:start position:0%
okay we um to enable to enable community
 
01:37:28.030 --> 01:37:28.040 align:start position:0%
a town to say that they want to wave the
 
01:37:28.040 --> 01:37:29.310 align:start position:0%
a town to say that they want to wave the
food

01:37:29.310 --> 01:37:29.320 align:start position:0%
food
 
01:37:31.550 --> 01:37:31.560 align:start position:0%
requirements okay they want to wave that
 
01:37:32.990 --> 01:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
section of the bill in other words this
 
01:37:35.510 --> 01:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
this amendment is that they want to wave
 
01:37:39.189 --> 01:37:39.199 align:start position:0%
it the question still comes up to that
 
01:37:42.430 --> 01:37:42.440 align:start position:0%
are they also waving liquor
 
01:37:44.709 --> 01:37:44.719 align:start position:0%
enforcement because liquor enforcement
 
01:37:47.109 --> 01:37:47.119 align:start position:0%
would contend that that dis
 
01:37:50.709 --> 01:37:50.719 align:start position:0%
establishment would be a magnet for over
 
01:37:52.629 --> 01:37:52.639 align:start position:0%
serving and that they would need to
 
01:37:55.070 --> 01:37:55.080 align:start position:0%
spend a little more time visiting that
 
01:37:57.430 --> 01:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
establishment where where does this say
 
01:37:59.790 --> 01:37:59.800 align:start position:0%
it's an enabling law as opposed to you
 
01:38:01.149 --> 01:38:01.159 align:start position:0%
no I'm not saying I'm saying you're
 
01:38:03.430 --> 01:38:03.440 align:start position:0%
proposing that Amendment yes you're
 
01:38:06.189 --> 01:38:06.199 align:start position:0%
proposing an amendment to just make it
 
01:38:08.149 --> 01:38:08.159 align:start position:0%
enabling okay but and maybe we can't
 
01:38:10.629 --> 01:38:10.639 align:start position:0%
even do that but certainly not to make
 
01:38:12.229 --> 01:38:12.239 align:start position:0%
it a
 
01:38:16.589 --> 01:38:16.599 align:start position:0%
mandate right okay but right so so I'm
 
01:38:18.510 --> 01:38:18.520 align:start position:0%
just pointing out to you that if we were
 
01:38:21.310 --> 01:38:21.320 align:start position:0%
to making this enabling that the town
 
01:38:23.990 --> 01:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
the city of Cl it's a city right and the
 
01:38:27.390 --> 01:38:27.400 align:start position:0%
City of Claremont that they the uh they
 
01:38:30.830 --> 01:38:30.840 align:start position:0%
could vote to um make
 
01:38:34.390 --> 01:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
it that that that would not uh make it
 
01:38:36.310 --> 01:38:36.320 align:start position:0%
uh that the Liquor Commission would not
 
01:38:38.550 --> 01:38:38.560 align:start position:0%
enforce the food
 
01:38:40.669 --> 01:38:40.679 align:start position:0%
requirement the LI commission say well
 
01:38:42.109 --> 01:38:42.119 align:start position:0%
that's great you save a little money and
 
01:38:43.870 --> 01:38:43.880 align:start position:0%
us having to come in and audit the food
 
01:38:46.629 --> 01:38:46.639 align:start position:0%
sales but we're we would be very
 
01:38:49.990 --> 01:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
concerned is you're now a magnet for
 
01:38:52.709 --> 01:38:52.719 align:start position:0%
over consump you know over serving and
 
01:38:56.030 --> 01:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
therefore we need need to have send our
 
01:38:59.270 --> 01:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
our enforcement agency there more often
 
01:39:01.750 --> 01:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
so how are you going to make up for that
 
01:39:04.030 --> 01:39:04.040 align:start position:0%
and that would go back to the licensing
 
01:39:07.910 --> 01:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
fee so representative pus thank you Mr
 
01:39:10.390 --> 01:39:10.400 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
01:39:12.950 --> 01:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
question um in the Claremont area which
 
01:39:16.229 --> 01:39:16.239 align:start position:0%
you're representing uh do you know how
 
01:39:20.629 --> 01:39:20.639 align:start position:0%
many social clubs are in that area and
 
01:39:22.950 --> 01:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
as a followup are you aware that most of
 
01:39:23.950 --> 01:39:23.960 align:start position:0%
them have
 
01:39:23.960 --> 01:39:26.070 align:start position:0%
them have
a

01:39:26.070 --> 01:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:39:28.470 --> 01:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
bar thank
 
01:39:28.480 --> 01:39:30.830 align:start position:0%
bar thank
you

01:39:30.830 --> 01:39:30.840 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:39:36.310 --> 01:39:36.320 align:start position:0%
um excuse me that's fine um that's close
 
01:39:39.390 --> 01:39:39.400 align:start position:0%
close um there are there are several
 
01:39:42.390 --> 01:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
there's the oak ofion the the and yes I
 
01:39:45.070 --> 01:39:45.080 align:start position:0%
know they all have bars um they also
 
01:39:48.189 --> 01:39:48.199 align:start position:0%
serve food on occasion they have food
 
01:39:49.470 --> 01:39:49.480 align:start position:0%
they don't have the the same food
 
01:39:50.669 --> 01:39:50.679 align:start position:0%
requirement they don't have the same
 
01:39:53.629 --> 01:39:53.639 align:start position:0%
food requirement either but those been
 
01:39:56.229 --> 01:39:56.239 align:start position:0%
there for and and that's in the bill or
 
01:39:57.990 --> 01:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
not in this bill but it's in the in the
 
01:40:00.350 --> 01:40:00.360 align:start position:0%
liquor laws it says that a private club
 
01:40:04.229 --> 01:40:04.239 align:start position:0%
can have liquor only that's that's
 
01:40:07.229 --> 01:40:07.239 align:start position:0%
already established it's a private club
 
01:40:09.830 --> 01:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
so it's not just available to every
 
01:40:11.950 --> 01:40:11.960 align:start position:0%
citizen because some of those have
 
01:40:13.950 --> 01:40:13.960 align:start position:0%
requirements BFW you have to have
 
01:40:15.950 --> 01:40:15.960 align:start position:0%
veteran Legion you have to be someone
 
01:40:19.470 --> 01:40:19.480 align:start position:0%
had to be in the veteran um I'm not sure
 
01:40:21.109 --> 01:40:21.119 align:start position:0%
about the Jewish polish or the Polish
 
01:40:23.629 --> 01:40:23.639 align:start position:0%
American Club you have maybe have to
 
01:40:26.669 --> 01:40:26.679 align:start position:0%
have something like that so yes those
 
01:40:28.149 --> 01:40:28.159 align:start position:0%
those establishments are there but
 
01:40:30.350 --> 01:40:30.360 align:start position:0%
they're not they're limited to a
 
01:40:34.189 --> 01:40:34.199 align:start position:0%
specific sect of the citizens and and
 
01:40:35.830 --> 01:40:35.840 align:start position:0%
this bill is not just for Claremont it
 
01:40:38.669 --> 01:40:38.679 align:start position:0%
would be all all of New Hampshire too
 
01:40:41.990 --> 01:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
so but what she was representative spear
 
01:40:43.750 --> 01:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
was asking how would you feel if we just
 
01:40:47.510 --> 01:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
made it enabling um at this point I I I
 
01:40:49.350 --> 01:40:49.360 align:start position:0%
think that we were we were hoping to
 
01:40:51.189 --> 01:40:51.199 align:start position:0%
just do it as but that may be a
 
01:40:52.550 --> 01:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
concession that I would definitely look
 
01:40:55.669 --> 01:40:55.679 align:start position:0%
at and I think enabling allowing a
 
01:40:57.430 --> 01:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
municipality sorry allowing a
 
01:40:59.510 --> 01:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
municipality to decide whether they want
 
01:41:01.310 --> 01:41:01.320 align:start position:0%
to have that type of establishment and
 
01:41:04.350 --> 01:41:04.360 align:start position:0%
there would be upon them but I think the
 
01:41:06.709 --> 01:41:06.719 align:start position:0%
Planning and Zoning would also help to
 
01:41:08.510 --> 01:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
kind of narrow down where those things
 
01:41:11.709 --> 01:41:11.719 align:start position:0%
would go okay represent Herbert we used
 
01:41:15.310 --> 01:41:15.320 align:start position:0%
to have a a very um
 
01:41:18.430 --> 01:41:18.440 align:start position:0%
robust probably a bar business in the in
 
01:41:21.870 --> 01:41:21.880 align:start position:0%
the state on the private club level yes
 
01:41:24.189 --> 01:41:24.199 align:start position:0%
and I don't know why I don't know why
 
01:41:26.470 --> 01:41:26.480 align:start position:0%
they stopped it well I don't know I mean
 
01:41:28.030 --> 01:41:28.040 align:start position:0%
I'm a member of something called the
 
01:41:31.189 --> 01:41:31.199 align:start position:0%
East Side Club okay I don't know that's
 
01:41:33.550 --> 01:41:33.560 align:start position:0%
not a sect and you know we're just on
 
01:41:36.790 --> 01:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
the east side so uh and and and they
 
01:41:40.189 --> 01:41:40.199 align:start position:0%
have a a a kitchen that they don't even
 
01:41:43.070 --> 01:41:43.080 align:start position:0%
use that is correct so I'm I'm I'm
 
01:41:46.990 --> 01:41:47.000 align:start position:0%
curious at one point in time what you're
 
01:41:51.629 --> 01:41:51.639 align:start position:0%
want to do was allowed in in the state
 
01:41:53.790 --> 01:41:53.800 align:start position:0%
but no longer I don't and I I don't know
 
01:41:57.589 --> 01:41:57.599 align:start position:0%
why it isn't that way yeah I I I don't
 
01:42:00.709 --> 01:42:00.719 align:start position:0%
know if it was allowed or if it was the
 
01:42:02.310 --> 01:42:02.320 align:start position:0%
because theyve met their
 
01:42:04.470 --> 01:42:04.480 align:start position:0%
$75,000 that no they didn't have that
 
01:42:07.070 --> 01:42:07.080 align:start position:0%
requirement my memory was that at some
 
01:42:08.870 --> 01:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
point in time we just grandfathered all
 
01:42:11.229 --> 01:42:11.239 align:start position:0%
the current clubs but could someone
 
01:42:14.189 --> 01:42:14.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:17.189 --> 01:42:17.199 align:start position:0%
today you have to come to the mic sorry
 
01:42:18.310 --> 01:42:18.320 align:start position:0%
why don't you grab one of these mics
 
01:42:21.709 --> 01:42:21.719 align:start position:0%
over here you want me to NOP you stay
 
01:42:25.189 --> 01:42:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:26.669 --> 01:42:26.679 align:start position:0%
can you have a seat they they could
 
01:42:28.189 --> 01:42:28.199 align:start position:0%
there's different requirements for each
 
01:42:30.510 --> 01:42:30.520 align:start position:0%
license type so right in this
 
01:42:31.910 --> 01:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
conversation we've talked about several
 
01:42:33.669 --> 01:42:33.679 align:start position:0%
different license types and what would
 
01:42:35.030 --> 01:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
require this you can still create a
 
01:42:36.870 --> 01:42:36.880 align:start position:0%
social club today there are certain
 
01:42:39.070 --> 01:42:39.080 align:start position:0%
requirements that you'd have to do to
 
01:42:40.229 --> 01:42:40.239 align:start position:0%
establish that what would be the
 
01:42:41.990 --> 01:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
threshold that the City of Claremont
 
01:42:44.390 --> 01:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
could not allow a club to you know what
 
01:42:46.510 --> 01:42:46.520 align:start position:0%
it could get into a process of allowing
 
01:42:49.550 --> 01:42:49.560 align:start position:0%
a club that is open to the public and
 
01:42:52.109 --> 01:42:52.119 align:start position:0%
and and and attractive to young people
 
01:42:53.990 --> 01:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
so there are no social clubs that are
 
01:42:55.709 --> 01:42:55.719 align:start position:0%
technically open to the public they are
 
01:42:57.550 --> 01:42:57.560 align:start position:0%
all members only clubs and members can
 
01:42:59.750 --> 01:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
sign in guests right um that can attend
 
01:43:01.910 --> 01:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
with them so there is no Club in the
 
01:43:03.189 --> 01:43:03.199 align:start position:0%
terms that you're talking about at the
 
01:43:05.189 --> 01:43:05.199 align:start position:0%
East Side club or the social club the
 
01:43:07.870 --> 01:43:07.880 align:start position:0%
vfw's those are all private clubs which
 
01:43:10.030 --> 01:43:10.040 align:start position:0%
is why they don't have a food require
 
01:43:11.390 --> 01:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons they don't have a
 
01:43:15.430 --> 01:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
food requirement um there's there's two
 
01:43:17.950 --> 01:43:17.960 align:start position:0%
in Matt maybe you can um help with this
 
01:43:21.510 --> 01:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
as well so I remember I'm old enough to
 
01:43:25.030 --> 01:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
remember that in in
 
01:43:27.709 --> 01:43:27.719 align:start position:0%
Utah they didn't have liquor
 
01:43:30.430 --> 01:43:30.440 align:start position:0%
establishments at all they had private
 
01:43:32.950 --> 01:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
clubs and they've had a statue that
 
01:43:35.109 --> 01:43:35.119 align:start position:0%
allowed you to just join the club the
 
01:43:37.430 --> 01:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
day you walked in the
 
01:43:40.070 --> 01:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
door you can join anybody can join the
 
01:43:42.790 --> 01:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
club it's just members only so so yes
 
01:43:44.750 --> 01:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
you could walk into a so we could we
 
01:43:46.589 --> 01:43:46.599 align:start position:0%
could mirror that in terms of if
 
01:43:51.030 --> 01:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
Claremont wanteded to to have a a club
 
01:43:54.830 --> 01:43:54.840 align:start position:0%
per se under the club stat statute that
 
01:43:57.430 --> 01:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
uh you're there's no uh timeline about
 
01:43:59.189 --> 01:43:59.199 align:start position:0%
joining the club that anybody could join
 
01:44:01.310 --> 01:44:01.320 align:start position:0%
the club that you know and walk in that
 
01:44:03.430 --> 01:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
day in terms of how you become a member
 
01:44:04.510 --> 01:44:04.520 align:start position:0%
that would actually be up to the
 
01:44:08.149 --> 01:44:08.159 align:start position:0%
individual Club as to as open their
 
01:44:09.830 --> 01:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
practices and policies on on how you
 
01:44:12.109 --> 01:44:12.119 align:start position:0%
become a member of the club there are
 
01:44:13.830 --> 01:44:13.840 align:start position:0%
certain requirements in terms of
 
01:44:16.589 --> 01:44:16.599 align:start position:0%
Licensing the club um if you're you know
 
01:44:21.030 --> 01:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
the vfw's or um American Legions correct
 
01:44:23.189 --> 01:44:23.199 align:start position:0%
you have to be part of the the national
 
01:44:25.070 --> 01:44:25.080 align:start position:0%
fraternal organization corre there's
 
01:44:27.030 --> 01:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
certain nonprofit clubs that can be you
 
01:44:29.350 --> 01:44:29.360 align:start position:0%
have an do you have to have an
 
01:44:32.310 --> 01:44:32.320 align:start position:0%
affiliation if you the club what's its
 
01:44:35.550 --> 01:44:35.560 align:start position:0%
affiliation I believe the e is a
 
01:44:38.390 --> 01:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
nonprofit oh it's just a nonprofit but
 
01:44:39.870 --> 01:44:39.880 align:start position:0%
you have to be established as a
 
01:44:41.870 --> 01:44:41.880 align:start position:0%
nonprofit for a certain you to have a
 
01:44:44.870 --> 01:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
nonprofit purpose ahead of time correct
 
01:44:46.070 --> 01:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
and there's and there's certain
 
01:44:47.910 --> 01:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
timelines that you have to I don't have
 
01:44:49.070 --> 01:44:49.080 align:start position:0%
I can certainly look them up that
 
01:44:50.149 --> 01:44:50.159 align:start position:0%
there's certain timelines you have to
 
01:44:54.109 --> 01:44:54.119 align:start position:0%
stay open and be be um established as
 
01:44:55.990 --> 01:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
that you can't be just the weekends
 
01:44:58.270 --> 01:44:58.280 align:start position:0%
correct no meaning meaning to to get the
 
01:44:59.709 --> 01:44:59.719 align:start position:0%
liquor license you have to actually
 
01:45:01.950 --> 01:45:01.960 align:start position:0%
establish yourself you the the non The
 
01:45:04.669 --> 01:45:04.679 align:start position:0%
Entity had to exist for a period of time
 
01:45:07.390 --> 01:45:07.400 align:start position:0%
correct sorry three years three years
 
01:45:08.870 --> 01:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
been nonprofit for three years so that
 
01:45:10.669 --> 01:45:10.679 align:start position:0%
that you could have some organization
 
01:45:13.030 --> 01:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
that's in Clermont that's been around
 
01:45:16.070 --> 01:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
for three years that they could uh
 
01:45:18.510 --> 01:45:18.520 align:start position:0%
create a club and they would be free
 
01:45:20.109 --> 01:45:20.119 align:start position:0%
from the food
 
01:45:22.270 --> 01:45:22.280 align:start position:0%
requirement right but there there are
 
01:45:24.550 --> 01:45:24.560 align:start position:0%
none and and again this isn't just about
 
01:45:26.149 --> 01:45:26.159 align:start position:0%
Claremont this is about every every
 
01:45:28.510 --> 01:45:28.520 align:start position:0%
municipality in New Hampshire um I just
 
01:45:31.310 --> 01:45:31.320 align:start position:0%
use Claremont as an example because of
 
01:45:35.550 --> 01:45:35.560 align:start position:0%
the the Uptown is is needs to be
 
01:45:38.030 --> 01:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
revitalized so right and that was that
 
01:45:39.950 --> 01:45:39.960 align:start position:0%
was an option but this goes for every
 
01:45:41.790 --> 01:45:41.800 align:start position:0%
every municipality in New Hampshire and
 
01:45:43.950 --> 01:45:43.960 align:start position:0%
I and so there is a cocktail license
 
01:45:45.589 --> 01:45:45.599 align:start position:0%
also that does not require food but you
 
01:45:47.709 --> 01:45:47.719 align:start position:0%
have to have 6,000 square feet if I
 
01:45:50.430 --> 01:45:50.440 align:start position:0%
remember right of usable no that's not
 
01:45:52.669 --> 01:45:52.679 align:start position:0%
no cocktail L does not have a square
 
01:45:54.669 --> 01:45:54.679 align:start position:0%
foot requirement there's there's one
 
01:45:56.870 --> 01:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
that's square foot is 6,000 usable
 
01:46:00.430 --> 01:46:00.440 align:start position:0%
feet there's area maybe are you thinking
 
01:46:02.870 --> 01:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
of a ballroom that's 500 seats Ballroom
 
01:46:05.030 --> 01:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
license Ballroom license that that's uh
 
01:46:08.229 --> 01:46:08.239 align:start position:0%
okay that's seating for 500 yeah yeah of
 
01:46:09.790 --> 01:46:09.800 align:start position:0%
open area that doesn't include your bar
 
01:46:11.070 --> 01:46:11.080 align:start position:0%
and everything so that's a pretty pretty
 
01:46:13.510 --> 01:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
large establishment so but we're we're
 
01:46:15.270 --> 01:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
we're looking at just targeting you know
 
01:46:18.669 --> 01:46:18.679 align:start position:0%
a smaller or you know a a middle siiz
 
01:46:20.870 --> 01:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
nightclub you know those types those
 
01:46:23.430 --> 01:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
types of things that would allow
 
01:46:25.390 --> 01:46:25.400 align:start position:0%
a Congregation of people to go and enjoy
 
01:46:29.030 --> 01:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
music or or dance and then socialize all
 
01:46:31.550 --> 01:46:31.560 align:start position:0%
right I I guess the problem I have in
 
01:46:33.550 --> 01:46:33.560 align:start position:0%
visualizing this is
 
01:46:37.149 --> 01:46:37.159 align:start position:0%
that is it's really I mean there
 
01:46:40.870 --> 01:46:40.880 align:start position:0%
obviously Manchester NASA
 
01:46:43.390 --> 01:46:43.400 align:start position:0%
Portsmith has the type of establishments
 
01:46:44.589 --> 01:46:44.599 align:start position:0%
you're looking
 
01:46:48.270 --> 01:46:48.280 align:start position:0%
for okay are they in terms of magnet and
 
01:46:51.189 --> 01:46:51.199 align:start position:0%
the magnets for young people all
 
01:46:53.830 --> 01:46:53.840 align:start position:0%
right the problem is is that a they have
 
01:46:53.840 --> 01:46:54.629 align:start position:0%
right the problem is is that a they have
the

01:46:54.629 --> 01:46:54.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:46:57.669 --> 01:46:57.679 align:start position:0%
population okay but more importantly in
 
01:47:00.870 --> 01:47:00.880 align:start position:0%
my mind they have the
 
01:47:04.030 --> 01:47:04.040 align:start position:0%
colleges that the people are looking for
 
01:47:07.390 --> 01:47:07.400 align:start position:0%
night life right and to think that you
 
01:47:10.669 --> 01:47:10.679 align:start position:0%
could uh that just to open up a
 
01:47:14.350 --> 01:47:14.360 align:start position:0%
small Speak Easy small establishment in
 
01:47:17.070 --> 01:47:17.080 align:start position:0%
Claremont and and Lord knows on Main
 
01:47:19.070 --> 01:47:19.080 align:start position:0%
Street there's plenty of great locations
 
01:47:21.550 --> 01:47:21.560 align:start position:0%
they could do that you're you're looking
 
01:47:23.030 --> 01:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
you want to make sure you it's got have
 
01:47:25.830 --> 01:47:25.840 align:start position:0%
a dance floor or stage and you know you
 
01:47:28.629 --> 01:47:28.639 align:start position:0%
want to have and get the bands but to
 
01:47:33.870 --> 01:47:33.880 align:start position:0%
get to be a magnet the having food or
 
01:47:36.390 --> 01:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
not having food seems to the least of
 
01:47:36.400 --> 01:47:37.229 align:start position:0%
not having food seems to the least of
your

01:47:37.229 --> 01:47:37.239 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:47:40.390 --> 01:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
problems it seems to me is is how where
 
01:47:42.229 --> 01:47:42.239 align:start position:0%
are the population you're drawing from
 
01:47:43.750 --> 01:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
how what are you where are they coming
 
01:47:47.350 --> 01:47:47.360 align:start position:0%
from I mean Dartmouth is like at least
 
01:47:49.910 --> 01:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
45 minutes away right right uh yeah
 
01:47:52.470 --> 01:47:52.480 align:start position:0%
roughly okay and I know Keen State's GNA
 
01:47:55.470 --> 01:47:55.480 align:start position:0%
be you know have so you don't even you
 
01:47:58.229 --> 01:47:58.239 align:start position:0%
know the the establishments you know in
 
01:47:59.950 --> 01:47:59.960 align:start position:0%
terms of what you're going to do to draw
 
01:48:01.990 --> 01:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
people it's an interesting
 
01:48:05.510 --> 01:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
concept um but I I I just I just don't
 
01:48:08.669 --> 01:48:08.679 align:start position:0%
see how it would work but so so uh as it
 
01:48:10.229 --> 01:48:10.239 align:start position:0%
is right now those people that would
 
01:48:11.709 --> 01:48:11.719 align:start position:0%
probably come there are already going
 
01:48:13.910 --> 01:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
over to bont they're going over to to
 
01:48:17.870 --> 01:48:17.880 align:start position:0%
other emo they're probably going to oimo
 
01:48:19.950 --> 01:48:19.960 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah absolutely I mean I've been
 
01:48:21.550 --> 01:48:21.560 align:start position:0%
there sure yeah I've been I've been to
 
01:48:23.629 --> 01:48:23.639 align:start position:0%
they've had some they have some bands up
 
01:48:25.790 --> 01:48:25.800 align:start position:0%
there and it's not always just about
 
01:48:27.750 --> 01:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
having a dance floor you know it's
 
01:48:29.669 --> 01:48:29.679 align:start position:0%
probably just a space big enough you
 
01:48:32.510 --> 01:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
have a a small you know musician in
 
01:48:35.390 --> 01:48:35.400 align:start position:0%
there or you know U or just play some
 
01:48:37.510 --> 01:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
music in there just just to have an area
 
01:48:40.189 --> 01:48:40.199 align:start position:0%
where you know you're not sitting at a
 
01:48:43.430 --> 01:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
round table or or sitting in a booth and
 
01:48:45.310 --> 01:48:45.320 align:start position:0%
and having a discussion you know over
 
01:48:48.709 --> 01:48:48.719 align:start position:0%
all the other you know just just a a
 
01:48:50.589 --> 01:48:50.599 align:start position:0%
much more relaxed environment than in a
 
01:48:52.270 --> 01:48:52.280 align:start position:0%
restaurant because in a restaurant if
 
01:48:53.470 --> 01:48:53.480 align:start position:0%
you're sitting you're going out there
 
01:48:54.830 --> 01:48:54.840 align:start position:0%
for a social event you're sitting there
 
01:48:56.629 --> 01:48:56.639 align:start position:0%
hanging around you're you're costing
 
01:48:59.750 --> 01:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
that waiter or waitress money because
 
01:49:02.030 --> 01:49:02.040 align:start position:0%
they're not turning those tables over so
 
01:49:04.910 --> 01:49:04.920 align:start position:0%
you can't just sit there and and
 
01:49:09.149 --> 01:49:09.159 align:start position:0%
and stay there for three hours having a
 
01:49:11.149 --> 01:49:11.159 align:start position:0%
conversation you you want to comment on
 
01:49:13.589 --> 01:49:13.599 align:start position:0%
that I would thank you for the
 
01:49:17.070 --> 01:49:17.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity Mr chairman um I I don't
 
01:49:20.669 --> 01:49:20.679 align:start position:0%
want to lose focus on the reason why
 
01:49:23.470 --> 01:49:23.480 align:start position:0%
food is part of establishments I know
 
01:49:25.270 --> 01:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
representative you and I have had
 
01:49:27.709 --> 01:49:27.719 align:start position:0%
several conversations about this last
 
01:49:32.430 --> 01:49:32.440 align:start position:0%
session um as I testified in the last
 
01:49:35.830 --> 01:49:35.840 align:start position:0%
meeting uh or in the full session the
 
01:49:38.830 --> 01:49:38.840 align:start position:0%
burnoff rate of alcohol is 015 an
 
01:49:42.629 --> 01:49:42.639 align:start position:0%
hour um we're looking at food as being a
 
01:49:45.189 --> 01:49:45.199 align:start position:0%
deterrent for an establishment which I
 
01:49:48.510 --> 01:49:48.520 align:start position:0%
can't wrap my head around that concept
 
01:49:50.390 --> 01:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
um I appreciate totally what the
 
01:49:51.990 --> 01:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
representative is saying and thank you
 
01:49:54.550 --> 01:49:54.560 align:start position:0%
for that congrat congratulations um at
 
01:49:57.629 --> 01:49:57.639 align:start position:0%
the at the same time food has always
 
01:49:59.350 --> 01:49:59.360 align:start position:0%
been you've heard me testify on this
 
01:50:02.270 --> 01:50:02.280 align:start position:0%
before the coffee filter for slowing
 
01:50:04.589 --> 01:50:04.599 align:start position:0%
down the absorption rate of alcohol in
 
01:50:07.830 --> 01:50:07.840 align:start position:0%
the body we're looking to keep you guys
 
01:50:10.270 --> 01:50:10.280 align:start position:0%
have me in my position to keep our
 
01:50:12.550 --> 01:50:12.560 align:start position:0%
communities in the industry safe that
 
01:50:14.629 --> 01:50:14.639 align:start position:0%
was Paramount in every conversation that
 
01:50:17.310 --> 01:50:17.320 align:start position:0%
I've had with every one of you um
 
01:50:19.830 --> 01:50:19.840 align:start position:0%
haven't had it with your new members yet
 
01:50:21.950 --> 01:50:21.960 align:start position:0%
but at the same time with the governor's
 
01:50:24.709 --> 01:50:24.719 align:start position:0%
office we are keeping people safe our
 
01:50:27.350 --> 01:50:27.360 align:start position:0%
model is a safe model as we testified
 
01:50:31.310 --> 01:50:31.320 align:start position:0%
before but to look at the the ingestion
 
01:50:34.910 --> 01:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
of food as being a deterrent for having
 
01:50:37.629 --> 01:50:37.639 align:start position:0%
the the younger that I as you all know
 
01:50:40.070 --> 01:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
because I've testified to it people like
 
01:50:43.270 --> 01:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
my daughter coming to an establishment
 
01:50:46.109 --> 01:50:46.119 align:start position:0%
they actually start their nights with
 
01:50:49.109 --> 01:50:49.119 align:start position:0%
having dinner and a glass of wine so the
 
01:50:51.589 --> 01:50:51.599 align:start position:0%
food is actually drawing them to the
 
01:50:54.910 --> 01:50:54.920 align:start position:0%
establishment not pushing them away from
 
01:50:58.069 --> 01:50:58.079 align:start position:0%
The Establishment I'm sure Mike um uh
 
01:51:00.709 --> 01:51:00.719 align:start position:0%
has some comments about this um because
 
01:51:03.510 --> 01:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
I can see he has comments about this but
 
01:51:06.709 --> 01:51:06.719 align:start position:0%
but he he did in the public area I don't
 
01:51:13.550 --> 01:51:13.560 align:start position:0%
want to lose focus on food being a a uh
 
01:51:16.189 --> 01:51:16.199 align:start position:0%
critical factor in slowing down the
 
01:51:18.109 --> 01:51:18.119 align:start position:0%
absorption of alcohol into the
 
01:51:20.350 --> 01:51:20.360 align:start position:0%
bloodstream and
 
01:51:24.350 --> 01:51:24.360 align:start position:0%
and that actually equals to negative
 
01:51:26.669 --> 01:51:26.679 align:start position:0%
effects negative incidents on our
 
01:51:29.270 --> 01:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
Highway negative effect effects in in
 
01:51:32.390 --> 01:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
the establishments that are owned um it
 
01:51:35.550 --> 01:51:35.560 align:start position:0%
just gives another opportunity to slow
 
01:51:38.750 --> 01:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
that down it to your uh by the
 
01:51:41.270 --> 01:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
responsible service but you're not
 
01:51:43.350 --> 01:51:43.360 align:start position:0%
controlling the absorption because each
 
01:51:45.390 --> 01:51:45.400 align:start position:0%
and every one of our metabolisms are
 
01:51:48.750 --> 01:51:48.760 align:start position:0%
different so that's an unknown how quick
 
01:51:50.750 --> 01:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
that's going to happen and and it's a
 
01:51:54.790 --> 01:51:54.800 align:start position:0%
scary slippery slope it really is so um
 
01:51:57.550 --> 01:51:57.560 align:start position:0%
that's my two cents um as I'm listening
 
01:51:58.910 --> 01:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
to all the
 
01:52:03.430 --> 01:52:03.440 align:start position:0%
testimony great represent s thank you so
 
01:52:05.430 --> 01:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
um when you were talking to him a minute
 
01:52:07.470 --> 01:52:07.480 align:start position:0%
ago you were saying how you don't see
 
01:52:10.149 --> 01:52:10.159 align:start position:0%
how a change in this law might help
 
01:52:11.470 --> 01:52:11.480 align:start position:0%
Claremont you know you don't see that
 
01:52:12.709 --> 01:52:12.719 align:start position:0%
they have the population to sort of
 
01:52:14.030 --> 01:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
support some of the establishments he's
 
01:52:16.350 --> 01:52:16.360 align:start position:0%
talking about but I would argue Mr
 
01:52:18.910 --> 01:52:18.920 align:start position:0%
chairman that it is not our job to try
 
01:52:20.589 --> 01:52:20.599 align:start position:0%
to get in the minds of what a business
 
01:52:22.750 --> 01:52:22.760 align:start position:0%
owner may or may not do to to be
 
01:52:24.069 --> 01:52:24.079 align:start position:0%
successful in whatever Town they're
 
01:52:25.430 --> 01:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
looking at across the state our job is
 
01:52:27.550 --> 01:52:27.560 align:start position:0%
to enable them to be successful in the
 
01:52:29.310 --> 01:52:29.320 align:start position:0%
state that is the job of our Commerce
 
01:52:33.950 --> 01:52:33.960 align:start position:0%
Committee and I think perhaps right now
 
01:52:35.149 --> 01:52:35.159 align:start position:0%
some of the things that you're thinking
 
01:52:37.470 --> 01:52:37.480 align:start position:0%
of wouldn't work in Claremont but maybe
 
01:52:38.830 --> 01:52:38.840 align:start position:0%
they would in the future maybe it would
 
01:52:41.109 --> 01:52:41.119 align:start position:0%
start off with something that would
 
01:52:43.149 --> 01:52:43.159 align:start position:0%
evolve as they became successful as more
 
01:52:44.589 --> 01:52:44.599 align:start position:0%
people got attracted to the town because
 
01:52:46.109 --> 01:52:46.119 align:start position:0%
there's exciting things going on like
 
01:52:47.470 --> 01:52:47.480 align:start position:0%
this isn't like you hit a switch and
 
01:52:49.870 --> 01:52:49.880 align:start position:0%
boom Clan Ron has like the most vibrant
 
01:52:52.870 --> 01:52:52.880 align:start position:0%
downtown in the state I mean nobody's
 
01:52:54.149 --> 01:52:54.159 align:start position:0%
nobody's suggesting that they do have a
 
01:52:57.709 --> 01:52:57.719 align:start position:0%
speak easy though I've been to it um but
 
01:53:00.109 --> 01:53:00.119 align:start position:0%
but I but I think I think we sometimes
 
01:53:02.709 --> 01:53:02.719 align:start position:0%
get caught up in what we think a
 
01:53:04.870 --> 01:53:04.880 align:start position:0%
business will do what kind of business
 
01:53:06.669 --> 01:53:06.679 align:start position:0%
model will be successful that's not our
 
01:53:08.310 --> 01:53:08.320 align:start position:0%
job our job is to allow the and
 
01:53:10.510 --> 01:53:10.520 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurs to be set free to figure
 
01:53:12.390 --> 01:53:12.400 align:start position:0%
out what they want to do and what's
 
01:53:13.709 --> 01:53:13.719 align:start position:0%
going to be successful I think that
 
01:53:15.069 --> 01:53:15.079 align:start position:0%
should be first and foremost on our
 
01:53:17.229 --> 01:53:17.239 align:start position:0%
thinking of things with respect to the
 
01:53:19.589 --> 01:53:19.599 align:start position:0%
safety I mean I I get it all I can say
 
01:53:21.990 --> 01:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
is I I've lived in communities that
 
01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:22.950 align:start position:0%
is I I've lived in communities that
don't

01:53:22.950 --> 01:53:22.960 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:53:25.750 --> 01:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
other states that don't require food
 
01:53:28.990 --> 01:53:29.000 align:start position:0%
Montana Massachusetts Illinois Germany
 
01:53:31.470 --> 01:53:31.480 align:start position:0%
I've lived at all these places and I
 
01:53:34.470 --> 01:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
mean I don't know that it's the world is
 
01:53:36.390 --> 01:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
that much more unsafe in those
 
01:53:38.149 --> 01:53:38.159 align:start position:0%
respective places than it is in New
 
01:53:39.790 --> 01:53:39.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I still think there's drunk
 
01:53:41.790 --> 01:53:41.800 align:start position:0%
driving going on here last I looked uh
 
01:53:43.069 --> 01:53:43.079 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's middle of the pack for
 
01:53:45.149 --> 01:53:45.159 align:start position:0%
drunk driving it's not like it's we'
 
01:53:46.990 --> 01:53:47.000 align:start position:0%
found the secret to get low levels of
 
01:53:48.870 --> 01:53:48.880 align:start position:0%
drunk driving um we know that we have
 
01:53:50.310 --> 01:53:50.320 align:start position:0%
the highest alcohol consumption or
 
01:53:51.830 --> 01:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
purchases in the in the country per
 
01:53:53.270 --> 01:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
capita largely distorted by
 
01:53:54.589 --> 01:53:54.599 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts coming over and buying it
 
01:53:56.950 --> 01:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
before you cut me off I understand that
 
01:53:59.629 --> 01:53:59.639 align:start position:0%
um so what I'm saying is
 
01:54:03.270 --> 01:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
is I think I think giving more
 
01:54:05.870 --> 01:54:05.880 align:start position:0%
opportunities is generally better and
 
01:54:08.750 --> 01:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
this allows for that I think to the
 
01:54:11.709 --> 01:54:11.719 align:start position:0%
extent that there there needs to be a
 
01:54:14.189 --> 01:54:14.199 align:start position:0%
higher fee I I'm on board with a higher
 
01:54:16.470 --> 01:54:16.480 align:start position:0%
fee to help the Liquor Commission do
 
01:54:18.589 --> 01:54:18.599 align:start position:0%
what they need to do like that's that
 
01:54:20.629 --> 01:54:20.639 align:start position:0%
seems reasonable to me I mean if if if
 
01:54:22.589 --> 01:54:22.599 align:start position:0%
if what they're saying is true and and I
 
01:54:23.910 --> 01:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
I have no reason to believe it's not
 
01:54:26.430 --> 01:54:26.440 align:start position:0%
that these these establishments could
 
01:54:29.030 --> 01:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
require extra policing then that's
 
01:54:30.950 --> 01:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
that's something we should considering
 
01:54:33.030 --> 01:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
this and then my final point would
 
01:54:35.830 --> 01:54:35.840 align:start position:0%
be with respect to food we already have
 
01:54:38.629 --> 01:54:38.639 align:start position:0%
no food regulations after 9 o00 and the
 
01:54:41.149 --> 01:54:41.159 align:start position:0%
world doesn't end after 9:00 you know I
 
01:54:43.310 --> 01:54:43.320 align:start position:0%
I agree with what um what the chief just
 
01:54:45.030 --> 01:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
said with respect to people like to go
 
01:54:46.830 --> 01:54:46.840 align:start position:0%
out to places sometimes food is the
 
01:54:49.390 --> 01:54:49.400 align:start position:0%
attraction they go there but sometimes
 
01:54:50.669 --> 01:54:50.679 align:start position:0%
maybe they want to go to dinner and then
 
01:54:52.990 --> 01:54:53.000 align:start position:0%
they want to go to the little Club next
 
01:54:55.149 --> 01:54:55.159 align:start position:0%
door well you know those those two
 
01:54:57.189 --> 01:54:57.199 align:start position:0%
aren't necessarily competitors as much
 
01:55:00.589 --> 01:55:00.599 align:start position:0%
some places don't want to be more than
 
01:55:01.950 --> 01:55:01.960 align:start position:0%
what they are now which is a restaurant
 
01:55:03.310 --> 01:55:03.320 align:start position:0%
that sells alcohol until 9: and then
 
01:55:05.270 --> 01:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
they close down some places want to be
 
01:55:06.990 --> 01:55:07.000 align:start position:0%
something different and our laws don't
 
01:55:08.510 --> 01:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
allow that and I think that there's no
 
01:55:10.950 --> 01:55:10.960 align:start position:0%
reason to think that the world can't
 
01:55:13.709 --> 01:55:13.719 align:start position:0%
exist with both being complimentary to
 
01:55:15.830 --> 01:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
each other rather than competitors to
 
01:55:17.910 --> 01:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
each other and that seems to be what
 
01:55:19.830 --> 01:55:19.840 align:start position:0%
we're acting as if it's like if you have
 
01:55:21.189 --> 01:55:21.199 align:start position:0%
this then all these restaurants have to
 
01:55:22.350 --> 01:55:22.360 align:start position:0%
close down because they won't be
 
01:55:23.950 --> 01:55:23.960 align:start position:0%
sucessful I just don't buy that that
 
01:55:26.790 --> 01:55:26.800 align:start position:0%
that isn't how it works in most places
 
01:55:29.750 --> 01:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
see that's where you're wrong because
 
01:55:31.350 --> 01:55:31.360 align:start position:0%
all the places you
 
01:55:34.350 --> 01:55:34.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned limit the amount of liquor
 
01:55:36.910 --> 01:55:36.920 align:start position:0%
licenses that are available in those
 
01:55:40.310 --> 01:55:40.320 align:start position:0%
towns that's their governor that's how
 
01:55:44.069 --> 01:55:44.079 align:start position:0%
they control it in New Hampshire anybody
 
01:55:46.750 --> 01:55:46.760 align:start position:0%
could get a liquor license you can have
 
01:55:48.950 --> 01:55:48.960 align:start position:0%
a town you can have a section of town
 
01:55:50.990 --> 01:55:51.000 align:start position:0%
where every business is a liquor you
 
01:55:53.229 --> 01:55:53.239 align:start position:0%
know is selling liquor and lots of
 
01:55:55.510 --> 01:55:55.520 align:start position:0%
entertainment and I would say that's the
 
01:55:57.709 --> 01:55:57.719 align:start position:0%
area where people would would be
 
01:56:00.669 --> 01:56:00.679 align:start position:0%
attracted to go to because it's got so
 
01:56:02.550 --> 01:56:02.560 align:start position:0%
many of those little places all close
 
01:56:04.350 --> 01:56:04.360 align:start position:0%
together with respect Mr
 
01:56:06.589 --> 01:56:06.599 align:start position:0%
chairman in Montana the one we talked
 
01:56:08.390 --> 01:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
about last week right quite familiar
 
01:56:10.229 --> 01:56:10.239 align:start position:0%
with it because when I was in grad
 
01:56:12.430 --> 01:56:12.440 align:start position:0%
school there one of the one of my
 
01:56:14.030 --> 01:56:14.040 align:start position:0%
colleagues who was in the same class as
 
01:56:17.709 --> 01:56:17.719 align:start position:0%
me wrote his whole thesis on Montana's
 
01:56:20.589 --> 01:56:20.599 align:start position:0%
ridiculous cast Medallion system right
 
01:56:22.790 --> 01:56:22.800 align:start position:0%
exactly so
 
01:56:24.629 --> 01:56:24.639 align:start position:0%
you say that's where I'm wrong but the
 
01:56:26.629 --> 01:56:26.639 align:start position:0%
reality of it is there are plenty of
 
01:56:29.270 --> 01:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
restaurants in Boseman Montana where I
 
01:56:31.669 --> 01:56:31.679 align:start position:0%
went to school in every other town in
 
01:56:34.109 --> 01:56:34.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire where there are
 
01:56:35.990 --> 01:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
restaurants that serve alcohol and then
 
01:56:38.149 --> 01:56:38.159 align:start position:0%
there are just straight up bars now if
 
01:56:39.790 --> 01:56:39.800 align:start position:0%
what you're saying is true and and the
 
01:56:41.669 --> 01:56:41.679 align:start position:0%
cap on the number of licenses would lead
 
01:56:45.510 --> 01:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
to just one or the other there's also
 
01:56:47.229 --> 01:56:47.239 align:start position:0%
restaurants that don't tell alcohol so
 
01:56:49.030 --> 01:56:49.040 align:start position:0%
like there are business models that work
 
01:56:50.709 --> 01:56:50.719 align:start position:0%
that require alcohol and that don't
 
01:56:52.790 --> 01:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
require alcohol or that
 
01:56:54.910 --> 01:56:54.920 align:start position:0%
you know could be either way and and
 
01:56:56.430 --> 01:56:56.440 align:start position:0%
I've seen that in every place that I've
 
01:56:57.990 --> 01:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
lived same thing when I lived in Chicago
 
01:56:59.270 --> 01:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
I don't actually understand I don't know
 
01:57:01.030 --> 01:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
the liquor laws in Chicago but when I
 
01:57:02.870 --> 01:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
lived in Chicago yeah there was there
 
01:57:05.149 --> 01:57:05.159 align:start position:0%
were restaurants that sell small amounts
 
01:57:06.629 --> 01:57:06.639 align:start position:0%
of alcohol but that's not their primary
 
01:57:08.629 --> 01:57:08.639 align:start position:0%
business but they probably make you know
 
01:57:10.550 --> 01:57:10.560 align:start position:0%
money on on the the mixed drink that
 
01:57:12.149 --> 01:57:12.159 align:start position:0%
they sell and then there's the places
 
01:57:14.430 --> 01:57:14.440 align:start position:0%
that just sell alcohol
 
01:57:17.510 --> 01:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
and it's it hasn't migrated to just
 
01:57:19.830 --> 01:57:19.840 align:start position:0%
primarily alcohol serving establishments
 
01:57:21.550 --> 01:57:21.560 align:start position:0%
entirely with all the poor businesses
 
01:57:23.350 --> 01:57:23.360 align:start position:0%
going out of business so I don't agree I
 
01:57:25.229 --> 01:57:25.239 align:start position:0%
don't think I'm wrong I think I've my
 
01:57:27.470 --> 01:57:27.480 align:start position:0%
experience living in multiple places you
 
01:57:30.629 --> 01:57:30.639 align:start position:0%
see a even with a cap on licenses you
 
01:57:31.910 --> 01:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
see a
 
01:57:35.189 --> 01:57:35.199 align:start position:0%
vibrant uh industry of places that don't
 
01:57:36.870 --> 01:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
even sell alcohol and are doing just
 
01:57:39.149 --> 01:57:39.159 align:start position:0%
fine just selling food and selling food
 
01:57:41.470 --> 01:57:41.480 align:start position:0%
into places that only sell
 
01:57:44.069 --> 01:57:44.079 align:start position:0%
alcohol for example Uptown Lounge in
 
01:57:47.550 --> 01:57:47.560 align:start position:0%
uptown chicagoon is not Chicago okay I'm
 
01:57:49.149 --> 01:57:49.159 align:start position:0%
not claiming that it is where that's
 
01:57:51.189 --> 01:57:51.199 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying this the idea is this
 
01:57:52.709 --> 01:57:52.719 align:start position:0%
was an economic
 
01:57:55.510 --> 01:57:55.520 align:start position:0%
Innovation for a small town that's
 
01:57:58.950 --> 01:57:58.960 align:start position:0%
looking for how how do we you know spur
 
01:58:01.550 --> 01:58:01.560 align:start position:0%
you know spur the economy and in this
 
01:58:03.390 --> 01:58:03.400 align:start position:0%
case was how do we get more young people
 
01:58:06.149 --> 01:58:06.159 align:start position:0%
to want to stay in Claremont okay well I
 
01:58:09.229 --> 01:58:09.239 align:start position:0%
you know I I right now if you ask me
 
01:58:11.830 --> 01:58:11.840 align:start position:0%
what claremont's problem is is Claremont
 
01:58:15.390 --> 01:58:15.400 align:start position:0%
has very high property tax rates okay
 
01:58:16.990 --> 01:58:17.000 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:58:19.430 --> 01:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
so why would any young person want to
 
01:58:21.589 --> 01:58:21.599 align:start position:0%
live in Claremont I'm sorry that's New
 
01:58:23.310 --> 01:58:23.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has very high property taxes
 
01:58:25.950 --> 01:58:25.960 align:start position:0%
no Claremont is claremont's tax rate is
 
01:58:27.870 --> 01:58:27.880 align:start position:0%
three times
 
01:58:31.069 --> 01:58:31.079 align:start position:0%
my but but I but I think I think I'm not
 
01:58:32.550 --> 01:58:32.560 align:start position:0%
saying that this is going to solve
 
01:58:34.510 --> 01:58:34.520 align:start position:0%
clam's problem but there are a lot of
 
01:58:37.310 --> 01:58:37.320 align:start position:0%
reasons why New Hampshire is getting old
 
01:58:39.350 --> 01:58:39.360 align:start position:0%
older faster than every other state in
 
01:58:41.669 --> 01:58:41.679 align:start position:0%
the country there's a lot of reasons and
 
01:58:44.030 --> 01:58:44.040 align:start position:0%
we can go into those what I'm saying is
 
01:58:46.350 --> 01:58:46.360 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons is that New Hampshire
 
01:58:48.910 --> 01:58:48.920 align:start position:0%
is not considered a fun place to go and
 
01:58:51.669 --> 01:58:51.679 align:start position:0%
have NTI Sor there are a lot of people
 
01:58:54.109 --> 01:58:54.119 align:start position:0%
in and Portsmouth would disagree with
 
01:58:56.189 --> 01:58:56.199 align:start position:0%
you I would like to meet these people
 
01:58:57.750 --> 01:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
cuz I go to Portsmith and everything
 
01:58:59.790 --> 01:58:59.800 align:start position:0%
closes down at midnight like I've gone
 
01:59:02.390 --> 01:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
there there there it's not it's like i'
 
01:59:05.350 --> 01:59:05.360 align:start position:0%
I I was I went to the young Dems I went
 
01:59:07.629 --> 01:59:07.639 align:start position:0%
to the young Dems event in Portsmith two
 
01:59:10.229 --> 01:59:10.239 align:start position:0%
summers ago I I spoke at it and then
 
01:59:11.430 --> 01:59:11.440 align:start position:0%
afterwards went out with a bunch of
 
01:59:12.950 --> 01:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
people who were from Portsmith and like
 
01:59:14.550 --> 01:59:14.560 align:start position:0%
oh yeah it's like it see everybody talks
 
01:59:15.870 --> 01:59:15.880 align:start position:0%
about Port literally this is what people
 
01:59:17.310 --> 01:59:17.320 align:start position:0%
said to me everybody talks about
 
01:59:19.189 --> 01:59:19.199 align:start position:0%
Portsmith being like the cool town of
 
01:59:21.189 --> 01:59:21.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and it's it's still
 
01:59:22.870 --> 01:59:22.880 align:start position:0%
relatively sleep nothing's really open
 
01:59:24.229 --> 01:59:24.239 align:start position:0%
after midnight and I saw with my own
 
01:59:27.510 --> 01:59:27.520 align:start position:0%
eyes so what I'm saying is I understand
 
01:59:30.550 --> 01:59:30.560 align:start position:0%
this is not a high priority for you but
 
01:59:32.830 --> 01:59:32.840 align:start position:0%
and it's and I'm I don't even let's just
 
01:59:34.390 --> 01:59:34.400 align:start position:0%
change the subject here's because you're
 
01:59:35.990 --> 01:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
I get it here's the point that I'm
 
01:59:39.229 --> 01:59:39.239 align:start position:0%
making and that is that he wants to
 
01:59:42.350 --> 01:59:42.360 align:start position:0%
they're are proposing a radical change
 
01:59:44.350 --> 01:59:44.360 align:start position:0%
in our law this is a radical change we
 
01:59:46.350 --> 01:59:46.360 align:start position:0%
haven't talked about what about the off-
 
01:59:48.310 --> 01:59:48.320 align:start position:0%
premise lienes who are going to have the
 
01:59:50.270 --> 01:59:50.280 align:start position:0%
food requirement they're going to say us
 
01:59:51.589 --> 01:59:51.599 align:start position:0%
too we want to get rid of the food
 
01:59:51.599 --> 01:59:52.709 align:start position:0%
too we want to get rid of the food
requirement

01:59:52.709 --> 01:59:52.719 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
01:59:55.870 --> 01:59:55.880 align:start position:0%
okay we're talking about something that
 
01:59:58.629 --> 01:59:58.639 align:start position:0%
it was instit it's part of our initial
 
02:00:01.910 --> 02:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
statutes it's been on the books since
 
02:00:06.149 --> 02:00:06.159 align:start position:0%
1934 and to throw that baby out all
 
02:00:08.030 --> 02:00:08.040 align:start position:0%
right with the concept that we're going
 
02:00:10.870 --> 02:00:10.880 align:start position:0%
to be some kind of economic engine to me
 
02:00:13.629 --> 02:00:13.639 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense that's all I'm saying
 
02:00:16.109 --> 02:00:16.119 align:start position:0%
but at at the same time I understand
 
02:00:18.109 --> 02:00:18.119 align:start position:0%
where you're coming from is that boy we
 
02:00:19.629 --> 02:00:19.639 align:start position:0%
need to do you know wouldn't it be great
 
02:00:21.470 --> 02:00:21.480 align:start position:0%
to do something what why not just be
 
02:00:21.480 --> 02:00:22.470 align:start position:0%
to do something what why not just be
enabled

02:00:22.470 --> 02:00:22.480 align:start position:0%
enabled
 
02:00:24.430 --> 02:00:24.440 align:start position:0%
okay why not just let people do what
 
02:00:26.390 --> 02:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
they want to do and let's hope for the
 
02:00:28.950 --> 02:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
best and I'm sorry I'm I'm not there I'm
 
02:00:30.709 --> 02:00:30.719 align:start position:0%
not you know I you were at one point you
 
02:00:32.750 --> 02:00:32.760 align:start position:0%
tried to do this you told me 10 years
 
02:00:34.830 --> 02:00:34.840 align:start position:0%
ago or whatever what has changed in 10
 
02:00:36.629 --> 02:00:36.639 align:start position:0%
years what's changed in 10 years is I
 
02:00:38.750 --> 02:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
had my head handed to me on the house
 
02:00:41.470 --> 02:00:41.480 align:start position:0%
floor that was you know what happened
 
02:00:43.350 --> 02:00:43.360 align:start position:0%
every restant it's not because you saw
 
02:00:44.669 --> 02:00:44.679 align:start position:0%
the light it's because somebody attacked
 
02:00:47.149 --> 02:00:47.159 align:start position:0%
you every rest no I didn't tack that bad
 
02:00:49.109 --> 02:00:49.119 align:start position:0%
way I'm saying that the bill died it
 
02:00:51.709 --> 02:00:51.719 align:start position:0%
mean I didn't even get a 100 votes okay
 
02:00:55.350 --> 02:00:55.360 align:start position:0%
that that it was overwhelmingly rejected
 
02:00:58.510 --> 02:00:58.520 align:start position:0%
by the house okay and that and maybe you
 
02:01:00.350 --> 02:01:00.360 align:start position:0%
could say things are changed but that
 
02:01:02.470 --> 02:01:02.480 align:start position:0%
was the second time I had sponsored it
 
02:01:05.430 --> 02:01:05.440 align:start position:0%
okay so yeah I'm I'm not ready to to put
 
02:01:07.990 --> 02:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
my name or go and support a bill when I
 
02:01:11.390 --> 02:01:11.400 align:start position:0%
know full well that the reality is that
 
02:01:13.990 --> 02:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
we H we have a system now in place and
 
02:01:16.709 --> 02:01:16.719 align:start position:0%
it's for a reason and the reason is as
 
02:01:19.069 --> 02:01:19.079 align:start position:0%
the commission said is that we we want
 
02:01:21.270 --> 02:01:21.280 align:start position:0%
people to eat food we want them to have
 
02:01:24.350 --> 02:01:24.360 align:start position:0%
food and so the idea that we want to
 
02:01:26.990 --> 02:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
have a bar bar and you know was fine and
 
02:01:28.589 --> 02:01:28.599 align:start position:0%
I mean I remember the days when when I
 
02:01:30.629 --> 02:01:30.639 align:start position:0%
was at Boston University and yeah
 
02:01:32.470 --> 02:01:32.480 align:start position:0%
Cambridge closed at one and Boston was
 
02:01:34.910 --> 02:01:34.920 align:start position:0%
two so yeah we all raced back over to
 
02:01:37.069 --> 02:01:37.079 align:start position:0%
Boston to drink drink extra hour had
 
02:01:40.430 --> 02:01:40.440 align:start position:0%
this debate last year okay so mean I
 
02:01:42.790 --> 02:01:42.800 align:start position:0%
understand all that but but in terms of
 
02:01:45.990 --> 02:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
of passing what I consider very radical
 
02:01:48.750 --> 02:01:48.760 align:start position:0%
legislation um in terms of our statue is
 
02:01:51.990 --> 02:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
on on this economic concept um I'm not
 
02:01:53.910 --> 02:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not there that's all and that and
 
02:01:55.270 --> 02:01:55.280 align:start position:0%
that's what the subcommittee is about is
 
02:01:57.189 --> 02:01:57.199 align:start position:0%
we all are we're working through we're
 
02:01:59.109 --> 02:01:59.119 align:start position:0%
allowed to talk about what we personally
 
02:02:02.550 --> 02:02:02.560 align:start position:0%
feel and and uh they're different from
 
02:02:03.950 --> 02:02:03.960 align:start position:0%
the you know the
 
02:02:06.109 --> 02:02:06.119 align:start position:0%
actual introduction the bill in the
 
02:02:08.310 --> 02:02:08.320 align:start position:0%
hearing so I'm just saying is you know
 
02:02:10.310 --> 02:02:10.320 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not there that's all I'm saying
 
02:02:11.790 --> 02:02:11.800 align:start position:0%
I mean I think the reason that people
 
02:02:15.069 --> 02:02:15.079 align:start position:0%
get the people the reason get so upset
 
02:02:17.629 --> 02:02:17.639 align:start position:0%
is is because they have a moat around
 
02:02:19.790 --> 02:02:19.800 align:start position:0%
their buildings or their businesses now
 
02:02:21.030 --> 02:02:21.040 align:start position:0%
and they don't want somebody to come in
 
02:02:23.950 --> 02:02:23.960 align:start position:0%
and be different and their fear is that
 
02:02:25.229 --> 02:02:25.239 align:start position:0%
some of them which some of them might go
 
02:02:28.109 --> 02:02:28.119 align:start position:0%
out of business but many of them would
 
02:02:29.870 --> 02:02:29.880 align:start position:0%
stay in business they just they'll just
 
02:02:32.470 --> 02:02:32.480 align:start position:0%
change like this is how it works
 
02:02:35.589 --> 02:02:35.599 align:start position:0%
like that logic of changing it suggests
 
02:02:37.310 --> 02:02:37.320 align:start position:0%
that we
 
02:02:40.790 --> 02:02:40.800 align:start position:0%
have the it suggests that this is an
 
02:02:42.510 --> 02:02:42.520 align:start position:0%
inferior law that they wouldn't have
 
02:02:44.189 --> 02:02:44.199 align:start position:0%
abided by had it been different but
 
02:02:45.550 --> 02:02:45.560 align:start position:0%
because it was they had to do it and we
 
02:02:47.069 --> 02:02:47.079 align:start position:0%
tied their hands well that's not a
 
02:02:49.149 --> 02:02:49.159 align:start position:0%
reason to keep something on the books
 
02:02:52.189 --> 02:02:52.199 align:start position:0%
okay fair enough representative Burrows
 
02:02:53.589 --> 02:02:53.599 align:start position:0%
thanks I have a question for the Liquor
 
02:02:55.229 --> 02:02:55.239 align:start position:0%
Commission because I share your concern
 
02:02:57.629 --> 02:02:57.639 align:start position:0%
about the food and this may be a dumb
 
02:02:59.069 --> 02:02:59.079 align:start position:0%
question but what's the definition of
 
02:03:01.390 --> 02:03:01.400 align:start position:0%
food would you feel more comfortable if
 
02:03:05.510 --> 02:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
a bar had popcorn and um checks mix and
 
02:03:07.189 --> 02:03:07.199 align:start position:0%
pretzels and all that that was my bill
 
02:03:09.790 --> 02:03:09.800 align:start position:0%
last time we literally signed that bill
 
02:03:12.189 --> 02:03:12.199 align:start position:0%
last time oh okay I must have been
 
02:03:14.950 --> 02:03:14.960 align:start position:0%
sleep they want real food they want real
 
02:03:18.270 --> 02:03:18.280 align:start position:0%
real food real okay we're not feeding
 
02:03:21.790 --> 02:03:21.800 align:start position:0%
carb carbs and and salt yeah thank you m
 
02:03:24.750 --> 02:03:24.760 align:start position:0%
CH I have a would you believe um I was
 
02:03:27.870 --> 02:03:27.880 align:start position:0%
in the Air Force for a bunch of years I
 
02:03:29.550 --> 02:03:29.560 align:start position:0%
spent three years in
 
02:03:33.149 --> 02:03:33.159 align:start position:0%
Europe uh I was either stationed in or
 
02:03:36.550 --> 02:03:36.560 align:start position:0%
temporary duty to 16 different countries
 
02:03:41.109 --> 02:03:41.119 align:start position:0%
over in Europe uh I went into a a guest
 
02:03:41.119 --> 02:03:42.189 align:start position:0%
over in Europe uh I went into a a guest
house

02:03:42.189 --> 02:03:42.199 align:start position:0%
house
 
02:03:47.149 --> 02:03:47.159 align:start position:0%
penson uh every establishment had food
 
02:03:51.149 --> 02:03:51.159 align:start position:0%
every establishment there were no bars
 
02:03:53.870 --> 02:03:53.880 align:start position:0%
that I know in Europe and I ate and
 
02:03:56.189 --> 02:03:56.199 align:start position:0%
drank in a lot of places and I just
 
02:04:00.149 --> 02:04:00.159 align:start position:0%
drank in a bunch of places that had food
 
02:04:03.709 --> 02:04:03.719 align:start position:0%
but there was no mandate to buy the food
 
02:04:07.629 --> 02:04:07.639 align:start position:0%
so that's my would you believe
 
02:04:11.069 --> 02:04:11.079 align:start position:0%
okay uh I think I'll make a make the
 
02:04:14.149 --> 02:04:14.159 align:start position:0%

03:28:36.830 --> 03:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
Co no yeah
 
03:28:36.840 --> 03:28:40.550 align:start position:0%
Co no yeah
no

03:28:40.550 --> 03:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:44.229 --> 03:28:44.239 align:start position:0%
it no that's Sal excuse
 
03:28:54.070 --> 03:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:45.030 --> 03:29:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:45.040 --> 03:30:14.950 align:start position:0%
 
never

03:30:14.950 --> 03:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:14.960 --> 03:30:44.910 align:start position:0%
 
e

03:30:44.910 --> 03:30:44.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:28.870 --> 03:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:32.110 --> 03:31:32.120 align:start position:0%
okay just want to make sure I have the
 
03:31:35.389 --> 03:31:35.399 align:start position:0%
the right committee here all right so
 
03:31:39.269 --> 03:31:39.279 align:start position:0%
this is the business banking and we have
 
03:31:44.269 --> 03:31:44.279 align:start position:0%
Keith Ammon melier Herbert spear hunt
 
03:31:49.550 --> 03:31:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:57.110 --> 03:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:57.120 --> 03:32:04.309 align:start position:0%
 
right

03:32:04.309 --> 03:32:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:06.830 --> 03:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
okay all right uh Keith there's any
 
03:32:08.189 --> 03:32:08.199 align:start position:0%
particular order you want to take these
 
03:32:12.469 --> 03:32:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:16.110 --> 03:32:16.120 align:start position:0%
on see who's in the room do we
 
03:32:18.150 --> 03:32:18.160 align:start position:0%
so I I think maybe the easiest one to
 
03:32:21.590 --> 03:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
dispatch is the 3 310 which is the study
 
03:32:25.349 --> 03:32:25.359 align:start position:0%
commission study commission okay and my
 
03:32:27.189 --> 03:32:27.199 align:start position:0%
recollection is we were going to discuss
 
03:32:31.389 --> 03:32:31.399 align:start position:0%
duties and uh members right well get I
 
03:32:34.189 --> 03:32:34.199 align:start position:0%
get um I don't know I had
 
03:32:37.590 --> 03:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
this it's going back and forth about 302
 
03:32:38.670 --> 03:32:38.680 align:start position:0%
with the state
 
03:32:41.830 --> 03:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
treasurer invest would you be really
 
03:32:45.110 --> 03:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
upset if we just take that and put it
 
03:32:46.870 --> 03:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
part of the commission have them figure
 
03:32:50.910 --> 03:32:50.920 align:start position:0%
out how to do that I think that's too
 
03:32:53.030 --> 03:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
much for that commission to it's already
 
03:32:55.510 --> 03:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
got stable token and real world asset
 
03:32:57.990 --> 03:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
regulations those are two huge things
 
03:33:00.269 --> 03:33:00.279 align:start position:0%
right would you want it to be the only
 
03:33:02.429 --> 03:33:02.439 align:start position:0%
the only issue is that that you know
 
03:33:03.910 --> 03:33:03.920 align:start position:0%
well I'll take digital asss and leave
 
03:33:05.950 --> 03:33:05.960 align:start position:0%
the in uh precious metals but then I
 
03:33:08.269 --> 03:33:08.279 align:start position:0%
found out that no state has passed
 
03:33:10.750 --> 03:33:10.760 align:start position:0%
precious metals yet yeah so then I'm s
 
03:33:13.550 --> 03:33:13.560 align:start position:0%
of saying you know so this is if we're
 
03:33:15.150 --> 03:33:15.160 align:start position:0%
going to you're going to start with 302
 
03:33:17.189 --> 03:33:17.199 align:start position:0%
yeah let's just start with 302 all right
 
03:33:20.870 --> 03:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
so this is my I can pass this out okay
 
03:33:23.269 --> 03:33:23.279 align:start position:0%
uh hold on a
 
03:33:25.790 --> 03:33:25.800 align:start position:0%
second this is my proposal for what to
 
03:33:29.389 --> 03:33:29.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:32.950 --> 03:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
okay okay so theoretically there's only
 
03:33:35.269 --> 03:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
a limited amount so people need to
 
03:33:38.309 --> 03:33:38.319 align:start position:0%
share I printed eight so so
 
03:33:40.550 --> 03:33:40.560 align:start position:0%
theoretically the committee committee
 
03:33:43.950 --> 03:33:43.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:46.950 --> 03:33:46.960 align:start position:0%
nine so so I'll share share mine with
 
03:33:50.750 --> 03:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
John it didn't it didn't um change it
 
03:33:53.830 --> 03:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
did he no this is a oh it was this is
 
03:33:59.590 --> 03:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:02.710 --> 03:34:02.720 align:start position:0%
us it's basically stripping some of the
 
03:34:06.389 --> 03:34:06.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:12.150 --> 03:34:12.160 align:start position:0%
bill oh okay got all red yeah so strike
 
03:34:13.510 --> 03:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
all the strike throughs would be
 
03:34:16.189 --> 03:34:16.199 align:start position:0%
eliminated so I can go over it on on the
 
03:34:24.630 --> 03:34:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:34.590 --> 03:34:34.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:43.670 --> 03:34:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:47.070 --> 03:34:47.080 align:start position:0%
sure okay all right
 
03:34:49.630 --> 03:34:49.640 align:start position:0%
here I'm just I'm just I'm cheing out
 
03:34:51.389 --> 03:34:51.399 align:start position:0%
the red lines so I can speak to the
 
03:34:53.110 --> 03:34:53.120 align:start position:0%
proposal if you'd like yeah go ahead
 
03:34:57.630 --> 03:34:57.640 align:start position:0%
please so there are um there are some
 
03:34:59.110 --> 03:34:59.120 align:start position:0%
ancillary things in here that I think
 
03:35:02.910 --> 03:35:02.920 align:start position:0%
are kind of uh to too far ahead and I I
 
03:35:04.309 --> 03:35:04.319 align:start position:0%
don't think they they make sense at this
 
03:35:06.349 --> 03:35:06.359 align:start position:0%
point in time okay and that would be so
 
03:35:09.309 --> 03:35:09.319 align:start position:0%
I'm on page two line five we'll remove
 
03:35:17.030 --> 03:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:20.750 --> 03:35:20.760 align:start position:0%
so page two line five uh striking stable
 
03:35:24.429 --> 03:35:24.439 align:start position:0%
coins line seven striking staking line
 
03:35:27.870 --> 03:35:27.880 align:start position:0%
10 striking staking as a service and
 
03:35:30.630 --> 03:35:30.640 align:start position:0%
that's related to line 16 removing
 
03:35:35.309 --> 03:35:35.319 align:start position:0%
stable coin and line 25 removing that
 
03:35:37.030 --> 03:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
the state treasure May engage in lending
 
03:35:39.269 --> 03:35:39.279 align:start position:0%
or staking I think that's
 
03:35:41.990 --> 03:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
probably those things are too far in the
 
03:35:44.870 --> 03:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
future and don't make any sense if we
 
03:35:46.070 --> 03:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
want to simplify this this bill we
 
03:35:48.630 --> 03:35:48.640 align:start position:0%
remove those right and then my my final
 
03:35:52.150 --> 03:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
proposal is on line 18 I think 10% is
 
03:35:56.309 --> 03:35:56.319 align:start position:0%
too high if we made that 5% or 2% you
 
03:36:00.590 --> 03:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:03.070 --> 03:36:03.080 align:start position:0%
maximum so that that that would be my
 
03:36:05.150 --> 03:36:05.160 align:start position:0%
proposal something lower so you just
 
03:36:07.030 --> 03:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
right at this point you just crossed out
 
03:36:09.710 --> 03:36:09.720 align:start position:0%
and and you haven't put a new number in
 
03:36:11.189 --> 03:36:11.199 align:start position:0%
I it's in the comment but it didn't
 
03:36:13.790 --> 03:36:13.800 align:start position:0%
print out com whatever number lower than
 
03:36:16.349 --> 03:36:16.359 align:start position:0%
10 we some lower percentage yeah okay it
 
03:36:18.870 --> 03:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
could be 2% you know right well I guess
 
03:36:20.309 --> 03:36:20.319 align:start position:0%
represent spear is going to talk about
 
03:36:22.429 --> 03:36:22.439 align:start position:0%
is is
 
03:36:25.309 --> 03:36:25.319 align:start position:0%
liquidity can I make a comment or yes go
 
03:36:27.990 --> 03:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
ahead but I was jumping the gun on very
 
03:36:29.110 --> 03:36:29.120 align:start position:0%
difficult to hear down at this end of
 
03:36:33.309 --> 03:36:33.319 align:start position:0%
the room okay we have two types of uh
 
03:36:35.990 --> 03:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
funding at at some point you could say
 
03:36:38.429 --> 03:36:38.439 align:start position:0%
two types of funding we have our uh
 
03:36:42.349 --> 03:36:42.359 align:start position:0%
budget State's budgets and we have our
 
03:36:45.870 --> 03:36:45.880 align:start position:0%
Reserve gold is not immediately
 
03:36:48.229 --> 03:36:48.239 align:start position:0%
it's not a liquid
 
03:36:52.349 --> 03:36:52.359 align:start position:0%
uh a liquid commodity or uh if if you do
 
03:36:54.309 --> 03:36:54.319 align:start position:0%
it as an ETF it's liquid if you do it as
 
03:36:57.550 --> 03:36:57.560 align:start position:0%
a as a as gold bullion it's not liquid
 
03:36:59.150 --> 03:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
and I don't have a problem with putting
 
03:37:01.670 --> 03:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
it into the reserve where I have a
 
03:37:03.710 --> 03:37:03.720 align:start position:0%
problem is putting it into the regular
 
03:37:06.070 --> 03:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
budget operating budget if we put it in
 
03:37:08.950 --> 03:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
the operating budget we have a pro we
 
03:37:11.710 --> 03:37:11.720 align:start position:0%
have rents we have salaries we have
 
03:37:13.349 --> 03:37:13.359 align:start position:0%
medical we have all kinds of things that
 
03:37:15.590 --> 03:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
get paid every week every month right
 
03:37:18.349 --> 03:37:18.359 align:start position:0%
cash flow yes right but but I see
 
03:37:19.950 --> 03:37:19.960 align:start position:0%
strategic Reserve
 
03:37:23.550 --> 03:37:23.560 align:start position:0%
established so is that what you mean by
 
03:37:26.389 --> 03:37:26.399 align:start position:0%
Reserve you know like the rainy day fund
 
03:37:29.349 --> 03:37:29.359 align:start position:0%
is that what the the reserve
 
03:37:32.790 --> 03:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
establishment is the rainy day fund can
 
03:37:35.189 --> 03:37:35.199 align:start position:0%
can I just say that's really just a a
 
03:37:38.950 --> 03:37:38.960 align:start position:0%
marketing term for this bill it's uh
 
03:37:41.110 --> 03:37:41.120 align:start position:0%
it's not an actual Reserve unless the
 
03:37:42.790 --> 03:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
treasurer decides to make one right so
 
03:37:44.269 --> 03:37:44.279 align:start position:0%
we're not we're not mandating it we're
 
03:37:46.510 --> 03:37:46.520 align:start position:0%
just giving her the tools
 
03:37:48.590 --> 03:37:48.600 align:start position:0%
could I make a couple how can that work
 
03:37:50.990 --> 03:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
okay yes
 
03:37:54.269 --> 03:37:54.279 align:start position:0%
represent first thing is um I don't
 
03:37:56.429 --> 03:37:56.439 align:start position:0%
think this any of this would go in an
 
03:37:58.750 --> 03:37:58.760 align:start position:0%
operating budget at all no it can't be
 
03:38:01.469 --> 03:38:01.479 align:start position:0%
no it can't be secondly um is it even
 
03:38:06.189 --> 03:38:06.199 align:start position:0%
necessary to have um a 2% or 5% limit um
 
03:38:09.309 --> 03:38:09.319 align:start position:0%
I would think that that the investment
 
03:38:13.110 --> 03:38:13.120 align:start position:0%
committee would make a decision so I
 
03:38:14.830 --> 03:38:14.840 align:start position:0%
think I don't think there needs to be
 
03:38:14.840 --> 03:38:16.110 align:start position:0%
think I don't think there needs to be
any

03:38:16.110 --> 03:38:16.120 align:start position:0%
any
 
03:38:19.630 --> 03:38:19.640 align:start position:0%
maximum limit are there at
 
03:38:21.990 --> 03:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
all you know they're supposed to be
 
03:38:23.830 --> 03:38:23.840 align:start position:0%
fiduciaries I think they could figure it
 
03:38:26.269 --> 03:38:26.279 align:start position:0%
out well I'm I'm just trying to figure
 
03:38:29.469 --> 03:38:29.479 align:start position:0%
out what this is first so we don't have
 
03:38:33.389 --> 03:38:33.399 align:start position:0%
a strategic Reserve now right so this
 
03:38:37.550 --> 03:38:37.560 align:start position:0%
thing is establishing one it's so this
 
03:38:39.110 --> 03:38:39.120 align:start position:0%
is being talked about at the federal
 
03:38:41.349 --> 03:38:41.359 align:start position:0%
level and many state levels are talking
 
03:38:45.469 --> 03:38:45.479 align:start position:0%
about uh H having States and and the the
 
03:38:47.670 --> 03:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
federal government have the ability
 
03:38:51.670 --> 03:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
to weather in inflation right so the US
 
03:38:53.510 --> 03:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
dollar has lost 20% of its purchasing
 
03:38:54.990 --> 03:38:55.000 align:start position:0%
power since the year
 
03:38:57.590 --> 03:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
2020 and that's that's it's we've had
 
03:39:00.670 --> 03:39:00.680 align:start position:0%
hyperinflation so not hyper but more
 
03:39:02.150 --> 03:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
than we've seen in our
 
03:39:05.349 --> 03:39:05.359 align:start position:0%
lifetime depending on how old we are can
 
03:39:07.349 --> 03:39:07.359 align:start position:0%
I pass out one more thing you don't have
 
03:39:09.950 --> 03:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
to read this whole thing I I just want
 
03:39:11.590 --> 03:39:11.600 align:start position:0%
to understand what we're doing here okay
 
03:39:14.429 --> 03:39:14.439 align:start position:0%
so I now see two things I see strategic
 
03:39:17.349 --> 03:39:17.359 align:start position:0%
Reserve established yeah and then in
 
03:39:20.150 --> 03:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
this section those are all definitions
 
03:39:23.870 --> 03:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
right so then I get down
 
03:39:28.830 --> 03:39:28.840 align:start position:0%
to um Roman numeral 2 on page
 
03:39:32.189 --> 03:39:32.199 align:start position:0%
two and and using our favorite
 
03:39:35.030 --> 03:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding yeah which then means
 
03:39:37.630 --> 03:39:37.640 align:start position:0%
you know for me that John here's the law
 
03:39:39.309 --> 03:39:39.319 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding is this is where we
 
03:39:43.269 --> 03:39:43.279 align:start position:0%
start and in here it talks about the
 
03:39:48.269 --> 03:39:48.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:50.990 --> 03:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
fun does that already
 
03:39:53.110 --> 03:39:53.120 align:start position:0%
exist well that would be the the rainy
 
03:39:56.309 --> 03:39:56.319 align:start position:0%
day fund this is the reny day fund
 
03:40:04.710 --> 03:40:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:04.720 --> 03:40:08.550 align:start position:0%
 
16

03:40:08.550 --> 03:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:12.269 --> 03:40:12.279 align:start position:0%
okay they invest so this is that so to
 
03:40:14.950 --> 03:40:14.960 align:start position:0%
if I understand correctly this is not
 
03:40:17.150 --> 03:40:17.160 align:start position:0%
the General operating
 
03:40:20.150 --> 03:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
budget okay right I don't think this is
 
03:40:24.590 --> 03:40:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:27.750 --> 03:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
fund a comment on that rainy day fund
 
03:40:30.269 --> 03:40:30.279 align:start position:0%
remember your comment was you're okay
 
03:40:33.389 --> 03:40:33.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:36.469 --> 03:40:36.479 align:start position:0%
thought it could be Pension funds too
 
03:40:38.030 --> 03:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
right which is I just want to point out
 
03:40:39.990 --> 03:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
one thing about the rainy day fund two
 
03:40:41.550 --> 03:40:41.560 align:start position:0%
years ago when I started here two and a
 
03:40:43.429 --> 03:40:43.439 align:start position:0%
half years ago it was $400 million today
 
03:40:46.189 --> 03:40:46.199 align:start position:0%
it's $250 million
 
03:40:48.429 --> 03:40:48.439 align:start position:0%
and we are facing some bdet uh budget
 
03:40:49.950 --> 03:40:49.960 align:start position:0%
shortfalls and all kinds of things
 
03:40:52.110 --> 03:40:52.120 align:start position:0%
facing who knows what's going to happen
 
03:40:54.710 --> 03:40:54.720 align:start position:0%
just just caution you that it's not just
 
03:40:56.910 --> 03:40:56.920 align:start position:0%
sitting there doing nothing you know I
 
03:40:59.030 --> 03:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
mean caution me to say that maybe by the
 
03:41:01.349 --> 03:41:01.359 align:start position:0%
end of the budget when we get to July 1
 
03:41:04.030 --> 03:41:04.040 align:start position:0%
it might be zero it could be zero yeah
 
03:41:06.070 --> 03:41:06.080 align:start position:0%
it could be zero which means we can pass
 
03:41:07.510 --> 03:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
the legislation but it doesn't mean
 
03:41:09.070 --> 03:41:09.080 align:start position:0%
anything because there's no money in it
 
03:41:10.550 --> 03:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
no I just want to just wanted you to be
 
03:41:12.030 --> 03:41:12.040 align:start position:0%
aware it's not something that's sitting
 
03:41:15.550 --> 03:41:15.560 align:start position:0%
out there totally safe got it but I I I
 
03:41:17.870 --> 03:41:17.880 align:start position:0%
would say that this isn't telling them
 
03:41:19.630 --> 03:41:19.640 align:start position:0%
to go and do this and if there's little
 
03:41:22.269 --> 03:41:22.279 align:start position:0%
money in the in in that rainy day fund
 
03:41:23.910 --> 03:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
they're not going to do it if they need
 
03:41:27.110 --> 03:41:27.120 align:start position:0%
the liquidity but this is down the road
 
03:41:29.309 --> 03:41:29.319 align:start position:0%
one one thing different about that right
 
03:41:32.830 --> 03:41:32.840 align:start position:0%
now the treasure we have is very
 
03:41:35.790 --> 03:41:35.800 align:start position:0%
competent but any day she could be made
 
03:41:38.229 --> 03:41:38.239 align:start position:0%
an offer to go into the into the private
 
03:41:39.910 --> 03:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
sector or she could go to Federal
 
03:41:41.630 --> 03:41:41.640 align:start position:0%
whatever and we could get somebody who
 
03:41:44.189 --> 03:41:44.199 align:start position:0%
in in here who's a cowboy so we need to
 
03:41:46.269 --> 03:41:46.279 align:start position:0%
be able to at least
 
03:41:48.710 --> 03:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
without knowing what the future is
 
03:41:50.710 --> 03:41:50.720 align:start position:0%
something I I think that there's
 
03:41:52.550 --> 03:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
probably an investment committee and I
 
03:41:54.349 --> 03:41:54.359 align:start position:0%
also think that we probably Farm some of
 
03:41:55.349 --> 03:41:55.359 align:start position:0%
the stuff
 
03:41:59.309 --> 03:41:59.319 align:start position:0%
out okay so that correct Keith I believe
 
03:42:02.349 --> 03:42:02.359 align:start position:0%
so can I just I have one more thing I
 
03:42:03.469 --> 03:42:03.479 align:start position:0%
didn't want to overwhelm everybody with
 
03:42:05.630 --> 03:42:05.640 align:start position:0%
paperwork when we met with the treasurer
 
03:42:07.429 --> 03:42:07.439 align:start position:0%
she gave us this print out I made copies
 
03:42:08.910 --> 03:42:08.920 align:start position:0%
I made eight copies I didn't realize it
 
03:42:10.469 --> 03:42:10.479 align:start position:0%
was nine on the commiss commission the
 
03:42:13.750 --> 03:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
committee um if you look on page three
 
03:42:14.950 --> 03:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
if you don't have one I'll pass mine
 
03:42:14.960 --> 03:42:16.550 align:start position:0%
if you don't have one I'll pass mine
down

03:42:16.550 --> 03:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
down
 
03:42:19.149 --> 03:42:19.159 align:start position:0%
I think I have one here pass okay page
 
03:42:21.349 --> 03:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
three uh that's a
 
03:42:24.510 --> 03:42:24.520 align:start position:0%
different page three is the list of
 
03:42:27.630 --> 03:42:27.640 align:start position:0%
approved uh Investments according to
 
03:42:30.229 --> 03:42:30.239 align:start position:0%
statute that and what we're trying to do
 
03:42:33.309 --> 03:42:33.319 align:start position:0%
is add add to that that list right right
 
03:42:38.750 --> 03:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:43.910 --> 03:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:47.710 --> 03:42:47.720 align:start position:0%
that's right this is all worm fuzzy did
 
03:42:52.030 --> 03:42:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:52.040 --> 03:42:53.750 align:start position:0%
 
there

03:42:53.750 --> 03:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:42:57.070 --> 03:42:57.080 align:start position:0%
pass Mr chairman
 
03:43:00.189 --> 03:43:00.199 align:start position:0%
okay there's two two things observations
 
03:43:02.110 --> 03:43:02.120 align:start position:0%
you have to speak to the mic not to me
 
03:43:04.349 --> 03:43:04.359 align:start position:0%
there's two observations that uh the
 
03:43:06.229 --> 03:43:06.239 align:start position:0%
budget is ridiculous this is not the
 
03:43:08.630 --> 03:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
budget about this this particular
 
03:43:11.750 --> 03:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
legislation at this particular time and
 
03:43:14.510 --> 03:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
that is that agement my understanding is
 
03:43:15.750 --> 03:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
we're running
 
03:43:19.710 --> 03:43:19.720 align:start position:0%
a $500 million hole right now that was
 
03:43:21.990 --> 03:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
out of the finance committee so I I'm
 
03:43:23.269 --> 03:43:23.279 align:start position:0%
I'm finding
 
03:43:26.149 --> 03:43:26.159 align:start position:0%
it difficult
 
03:43:30.870 --> 03:43:30.880 align:start position:0%
to do anything like this uh when when we
 
03:43:34.670 --> 03:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
have another very very important job and
 
03:43:37.469 --> 03:43:37.479 align:start position:0%
that is where are we going to well we
 
03:43:40.830 --> 03:43:40.840 align:start position:0%
can't find $500 million by the way right
 
03:43:42.990 --> 03:43:43.000 align:start position:0%
so I'm I've already written an essay
 
03:43:47.389 --> 03:43:47.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:49.070 --> 03:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
that means this legislation is
 
03:43:50.990 --> 03:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
meaningless because we will have no
 
03:43:53.830 --> 03:43:53.840 align:start position:0%
money in this fund anyways but that
 
03:43:55.510 --> 03:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
should not be a reason to stop us from
 
03:43:57.950 --> 03:43:57.960 align:start position:0%
doing it I think the context is
 
03:44:01.110 --> 03:44:01.120 align:start position:0%
important but fix oh so that we're in
 
03:44:04.189 --> 03:44:04.199 align:start position:0%
denial about our our our deficit
 
03:44:06.670 --> 03:44:06.680 align:start position:0%
situation if we're putting going forward
 
03:44:09.269 --> 03:44:09.279 align:start position:0%
and trying to do something Progressive
 
03:44:11.550 --> 03:44:11.560 align:start position:0%
and that might might not happen for
 
03:44:14.110 --> 03:44:14.120 align:start position:0%
another 5 to 10 years we shouldn't be
 
03:44:16.149 --> 03:44:16.159 align:start position:0%
doing this because we need to deal with
 
03:44:18.429 --> 03:44:18.439 align:start position:0%
the problem at hand I think we have more
 
03:44:20.269 --> 03:44:20.279 align:start position:0%
difficult issues that we need to deal
 
03:44:21.469 --> 03:44:21.479 align:start position:0%
but this is not a difficult issue
 
03:44:23.670 --> 03:44:23.680 align:start position:0%
because it's a non issue if we don't
 
03:44:25.309 --> 03:44:25.319 align:start position:0%
have any money then
 
03:44:28.510 --> 03:44:28.520 align:start position:0%
then then then the state treasurer won't
 
03:44:31.389 --> 03:44:31.399 align:start position:0%
do anything well I'm I'm predicting
 
03:44:34.269 --> 03:44:34.279 align:start position:0%
that's what's going to happen there you
 
03:44:39.349 --> 03:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
go yes representative um so we we none
 
03:44:41.710 --> 03:44:41.720 align:start position:0%
of us can foresee the future um but we
 
03:44:44.469 --> 03:44:44.479 align:start position:0%
can you know have the best plans for
 
03:44:46.670 --> 03:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
meeting the challenges of the future
 
03:44:48.790 --> 03:44:48.800 align:start position:0%
there's another aspect to passing this
 
03:44:50.149 --> 03:44:50.159 align:start position:0%
bill even if the treasur doesn't do
 
03:44:52.830 --> 03:44:52.840 align:start position:0%
anything for a few years with it uh and
 
03:44:54.309 --> 03:44:54.319 align:start position:0%
that send it sends a signal that New
 
03:44:57.790 --> 03:44:57.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is open to digital assets and
 
03:45:00.030 --> 03:45:00.040 align:start position:0%
uh there there is a race happening right
 
03:45:04.229 --> 03:45:04.239 align:start position:0%
now between States because a lot of
 
03:45:06.630 --> 03:45:06.640 align:start position:0%
people you know believe count me as one
 
03:45:09.910 --> 03:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
of them that digital assets are going to
 
03:45:11.349 --> 03:45:11.359 align:start position:0%
they're going to overtake our
 
03:45:13.550 --> 03:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
traditional Financial system they're
 
03:45:15.510 --> 03:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
going to the innovation coming out of
 
03:45:20.269 --> 03:45:20.279 align:start position:0%
that space is going to um you know I
 
03:45:21.590 --> 03:45:21.600 align:start position:0%
don't want to say supplant but we'll
 
03:45:23.590 --> 03:45:23.600 align:start position:0%
have to adapt to it right it's it's
 
03:45:26.429 --> 03:45:26.439 align:start position:0%
change that pretty much cannot be
 
03:45:28.910 --> 03:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
stopped and passing this bill would send
 
03:45:31.309 --> 03:45:31.319 align:start position:0%
a signal that New Hampshire is you know
 
03:45:33.750 --> 03:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
a jurisdiction that understands that so
 
03:45:36.189 --> 03:45:36.199 align:start position:0%
there's there's some symbolic you know
 
03:45:37.630 --> 03:45:37.640 align:start position:0%
benefit to
 
03:45:37.640 --> 03:45:39.149 align:start position:0%
benefit to
it

03:45:39.149 --> 03:45:39.159 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:45:42.790 --> 03:45:42.800 align:start position:0%
okay a question for Keith yes Keith I I
 
03:45:45.630 --> 03:45:45.640 align:start position:0%
I just very briefly glanced that that at
 
03:45:47.550 --> 03:45:47.560 align:start position:0%
that but everything in there is fixed
 
03:45:50.229 --> 03:45:50.239 align:start position:0%
income I didn't see any equities at all
 
03:45:52.229 --> 03:45:52.239 align:start position:0%
I mean no equities are not in there
 
03:45:55.149 --> 03:45:55.159 align:start position:0%
pardon but again this is this is under
 
03:45:55.159 --> 03:45:56.349 align:start position:0%
pardon but again this is this is under
her

03:45:56.349 --> 03:45:56.359 align:start position:0%
her
 
03:45:58.309 --> 03:45:58.319 align:start position:0%
current well if she's going to be
 
03:46:01.349 --> 03:46:01.359 align:start position:0%
allowed to invest in in gold or silver I
 
03:46:03.110 --> 03:46:03.120 align:start position:0%
think that they should certainly have
 
03:46:06.030 --> 03:46:06.040 align:start position:0%
equities in there as well well she's got
 
03:46:06.040 --> 03:46:09.870 align:start position:0%
equities in there as well well she's got
corporate

03:46:09.870 --> 03:46:09.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:13.229 --> 03:46:13.239 align:start position:0%
bonds I mean this is it's ridiculously
 
03:46:13.239 --> 03:46:17.590 align:start position:0%
bonds I mean this is it's ridiculously
conservative

03:46:17.590 --> 03:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:18.990 --> 03:46:19.000 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of good information
 
03:46:20.070 --> 03:46:20.080 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of good information in
 
03:46:22.189 --> 03:46:22.199 align:start position:0%
that packet um I apologize for not
 
03:46:24.389 --> 03:46:24.399 align:start position:0%
getting it to you sooner but I can uh
 
03:46:27.229 --> 03:46:27.239 align:start position:0%
email it it does have mutual funds but
 
03:46:28.590 --> 03:46:28.600 align:start position:0%
they're they're fixed income mutual
 
03:46:32.189 --> 03:46:32.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:34.670 --> 03:46:34.680 align:start position:0%
income right so theoretically everything
 
03:46:36.189 --> 03:46:36.199 align:start position:0%
in this list is pretty liquid so we're
 
03:46:40.710 --> 03:46:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:44.269 --> 03:46:44.279 align:start position:0%
year lose money in terms of Interest or
 
03:46:46.110 --> 03:46:46.120 align:start position:0%
pardon where where are we going to be
 
03:46:48.990 --> 03:46:49.000 align:start position:0%
losing uh inflation value you know
 
03:46:52.710 --> 03:46:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:55.790 --> 03:46:55.800 align:start position:0%
right and but this is what we use to get
 
03:47:02.990 --> 03:47:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:07.149 --> 03:47:07.159 align:start position:0%
rating so what Keith is saying is is
 
03:47:10.189 --> 03:47:10.199 align:start position:0%
that the reality is no we're not this is
 
03:47:13.750 --> 03:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
never going to happen even a cowboy that
 
03:47:15.790 --> 03:47:15.800 align:start position:0%
I can't imagine we the legislature cuz
 
03:47:18.349 --> 03:47:18.359 align:start position:0%
we are the ones who choose the state
 
03:47:21.469 --> 03:47:21.479 align:start position:0%
treasure I can't believe a cowboy or or
 
03:47:24.790 --> 03:47:24.800 align:start position:0%
the we would lose our mind and bring in
 
03:47:28.149 --> 03:47:28.159 align:start position:0%
a cowboy to be our state treasur but
 
03:47:29.550 --> 03:47:29.560 align:start position:0%
that at the end of the day the state
 
03:47:32.229 --> 03:47:32.239 align:start position:0%
treasur to maintain their their bond
 
03:47:36.110 --> 03:47:36.120 align:start position:0%
rating there she's going to ignore this
 
03:47:38.870 --> 03:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
legislation but he's saying that if we
 
03:47:42.189 --> 03:47:42.199 align:start position:0%
pass it it sends a message that New
 
03:47:44.309 --> 03:47:44.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh wants to be on the front
 
03:47:47.269 --> 03:47:47.279 align:start position:0%
Lin so that if the if things were to
 
03:47:49.950 --> 03:47:49.960 align:start position:0%
happen in the future that digital assets
 
03:47:52.510 --> 03:47:52.520 align:start position:0%
cuz we're one of the first states to do
 
03:47:54.710 --> 03:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
digital assets right how many states
 
03:47:56.510 --> 03:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
have digital assets now we have a good
 
03:48:00.790 --> 03:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
reputation uh in that space as being a
 
03:48:02.590 --> 03:48:02.600 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction that's friendly so it' be
 
03:48:06.429 --> 03:48:06.439 align:start position:0%
Texas Wyoming New Hampshire okay and a
 
03:48:09.030 --> 03:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
few other states terms of in the
 
03:48:11.389 --> 03:48:11.399 align:start position:0%
portfolio no no state has it no state
 
03:48:14.349 --> 03:48:14.359 align:start position:0%
has it no State uh might venture to say
 
03:48:17.590 --> 03:48:17.600 align:start position:0%
May never have it but that's not the
 
03:48:19.910 --> 03:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
point that he's making the point he's
 
03:48:22.229 --> 03:48:22.239 align:start position:0%
making is that if we put in there and
 
03:48:25.630 --> 03:48:25.640 align:start position:0%
say that the treasure the ne
 
03:48:28.429 --> 03:48:28.439 align:start position:0%
availability that we could in the future
 
03:48:31.990 --> 03:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
of all of a sudden the the bond councils
 
03:48:33.990 --> 03:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
or you know who are Moody is that is
 
03:48:36.070 --> 03:48:36.080 align:start position:0%
that the rating if Moody suddenly
 
03:48:39.630 --> 03:48:39.640 align:start position:0%
changed their mood about digital assets
 
03:48:41.590 --> 03:48:41.600 align:start position:0%
that we would be
 
03:48:43.870 --> 03:48:43.880 align:start position:0%
strategically ahead of everybody else to
 
03:48:46.229 --> 03:48:46.239 align:start position:0%
go ahead and take it advantage of it I I
 
03:48:49.750 --> 03:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
we we talk about being in the Forefront
 
03:48:52.990 --> 03:48:53.000 align:start position:0%
and eight states have passed laws you
 
03:48:54.950 --> 03:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
are in the forr to set up the commiss
 
03:48:56.790 --> 03:48:56.800 align:start position:0%
back to set up the same commission that
 
03:48:58.510 --> 03:48:58.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to be talking about next
 
03:49:01.550 --> 03:49:01.560 align:start position:0%
right and did it two years
 
03:49:04.030 --> 03:49:04.040 align:start position:0%
ago I think that the times of saying
 
03:49:06.710 --> 03:49:06.720 align:start position:0%
that we're going to be in the absolute
 
03:49:10.590 --> 03:49:10.600 align:start position:0%
Forefront well I mean you know one can
 
03:49:12.630 --> 03:49:12.640 align:start position:0%
can I ask or can I inject one other
 
03:49:15.510 --> 03:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
thing I can't hear anything uh so I'm
 
03:49:16.950 --> 03:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
talking closer to my mic is that
 
03:49:19.469 --> 03:49:19.479 align:start position:0%
sounding okay sounds better to me all
 
03:49:21.429 --> 03:49:21.439 align:start position:0%
right um there's a lot of changes
 
03:49:24.229 --> 03:49:24.239 align:start position:0%
happening in Washington DC right now as
 
03:49:26.870 --> 03:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
we speak on this issue and the LA the
 
03:49:29.349 --> 03:49:29.359 align:start position:0%
landscape is going to open up one of the
 
03:49:31.070 --> 03:49:31.080 align:start position:0%
things that could benefit our the local
 
03:49:34.590 --> 03:49:34.600 align:start position:0%
economy with a bill such as this is our
 
03:49:37.550 --> 03:49:37.560 align:start position:0%
state Banks may very likely be able to
 
03:49:39.469 --> 03:49:39.479 align:start position:0%
Charter these digital Assets in the very
 
03:49:41.590 --> 03:49:41.600 align:start position:0%
near future like you know within the
 
03:49:44.710 --> 03:49:44.720 align:start position:0%
next six to 12 months is my is my guess
 
03:49:47.630 --> 03:49:47.640 align:start position:0%
and that's that allows our our our
 
03:49:50.910 --> 03:49:50.920 align:start position:0%
banking system in the state to adopt you
 
03:49:52.870 --> 03:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
know these new things so that's another
 
03:49:55.750 --> 03:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
thing to consider um but wouldn't that
 
03:49:58.790 --> 03:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
be determined that in our state uh State
 
03:50:02.670 --> 03:50:02.680 align:start position:0%
Bank chapter we would have to then allow
 
03:50:05.349 --> 03:50:05.359 align:start position:0%
that in their section of the
 
03:50:07.750 --> 03:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
law because that's you know rather than
 
03:50:09.309 --> 03:50:09.319 align:start position:0%
a federally charged bank that if it's a
 
03:50:11.309 --> 03:50:11.319 align:start position:0%
State chared Bank don't don't we have
 
03:50:13.309 --> 03:50:13.319 align:start position:0%
these kind of same kind of parameters
 
03:50:16.429 --> 03:50:16.439 align:start position:0%
and what they're allowed to invest
 
03:50:17.830 --> 03:50:17.840 align:start position:0%
do we have the bank commissioner here
 
03:50:17.840 --> 03:50:19.229 align:start position:0%
do we have the bank commissioner here
today

03:50:19.229 --> 03:50:19.239 align:start position:0%
today
 
03:50:28.309 --> 03:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:30.910 --> 03:50:30.920 align:start position:0%
yes I'm Seth saki the general counc at
 
03:50:32.269 --> 03:50:32.279 align:start position:0%
the banking Department yeah there there
 
03:50:35.229 --> 03:50:35.239 align:start position:0%
are Provisions in RSA 383b that that
 
03:50:37.309 --> 03:50:37.319 align:start position:0%
provide that sort of guidance for banks
 
03:50:39.670 --> 03:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
okay so do we we don't have digital
 
03:50:41.630 --> 03:50:41.640 align:start position:0%
assets at this point in there those are
 
03:50:44.269 --> 03:50:44.279 align:start position:0%
not specified in 383b okay so at this
 
03:50:46.349 --> 03:50:46.359 align:start position:0%
point they would not be available to a
 
03:50:48.990 --> 03:50:49.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:52.429 --> 03:50:52.439 align:start position:0%
bank I'm I'm not prepared to say it that
 
03:50:54.149 --> 03:50:54.159 align:start position:0%
they're not they're not they're not
 
03:50:56.790 --> 03:50:56.800 align:start position:0%
specified in the statute
 
03:51:02.469 --> 03:51:02.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:02.479 --> 03:51:05.110 align:start position:0%
 
question

03:51:05.110 --> 03:51:05.120 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:51:09.309 --> 03:51:09.319 align:start position:0%
um we have a very difficult problem uh
 
03:51:12.750 --> 03:51:12.760 align:start position:0%
we're in a hole the hole is I understand
 
03:51:16.469 --> 03:51:16.479 align:start position:0%
in the order of $500 million
 
03:51:17.990 --> 03:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
what kind of bond rating do you think we
 
03:51:20.790 --> 03:51:20.800 align:start position:0%
would get in that
 
03:51:23.790 --> 03:51:23.800 align:start position:0%
situation so as the bank that's that's
 
03:51:26.149 --> 03:51:26.159 align:start position:0%
beyond my expertise I I wouldn't be able
 
03:51:27.309 --> 03:51:27.319 align:start position:0%
to comment on
 
03:51:30.229 --> 03:51:30.239 align:start position:0%
that so you're you're asking you're
 
03:51:33.630 --> 03:51:33.640 align:start position:0%
asking the wrong person yeah
 
03:51:33.640 --> 03:51:35.550 align:start position:0%
asking the wrong person yeah
so

03:51:35.550 --> 03:51:35.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:51:38.469 --> 03:51:38.479 align:start position:0%
okay yeah uh you want to spell it your
 
03:51:40.710 --> 03:51:40.720 align:start position:0%
name for her sure it's first name is
 
03:51:43.550 --> 03:51:43.560 align:start position:0%
Seth last name is Zaki Z is in zebra o r
 
03:51:51.830 --> 03:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:54.030 --> 03:51:54.040 align:start position:0%
okay I have a
 
03:51:57.030 --> 03:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
question yes go ahead I have a question
 
03:51:57.040 --> 03:51:57.870 align:start position:0%
question yes go ahead I have a question
for

03:51:57.870 --> 03:51:57.880 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:52:02.710 --> 03:52:02.720 align:start position:0%
kit uh kit I did go over the notes and
 
03:52:05.870 --> 03:52:05.880 align:start position:0%
everything you have given by us uh my
 
03:52:08.990 --> 03:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
question is there are five states which
 
03:52:10.429 --> 03:52:10.439 align:start position:0%
are in
 
03:52:14.830 --> 03:52:14.840 align:start position:0%
the uh cryptocurrency okay Wyoming Floyd
 
03:52:17.710 --> 03:52:17.720 align:start position:0%
Texas Arizona and New York so my
 
03:52:20.790 --> 03:52:20.800 align:start position:0%
question is have we done any kind of a
 
03:52:23.269 --> 03:52:23.279 align:start position:0%
research whether they are making any
 
03:52:26.189 --> 03:52:26.199 align:start position:0%
progress or it's good for them it is all
 
03:52:29.550 --> 03:52:29.560 align:start position:0%
whatever I read uh through my uh
 
03:52:31.910 --> 03:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
internet or whatever the stuff is on
 
03:52:36.070 --> 03:52:36.080 align:start position:0%
various uh boards various groups I don't
 
03:52:39.149 --> 03:52:39.159 align:start position:0%
see they are all confused they really do
 
03:52:40.830 --> 03:52:40.840 align:start position:0%
not know whether they have taken the
 
03:52:44.070 --> 03:52:44.080 align:start position:0%
right decision or not so if we are
 
03:52:44.080 --> 03:52:45.349 align:start position:0%
right decision or not so if we are
getting

03:52:45.349 --> 03:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
getting
 
03:52:49.030 --> 03:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
into this and we are telling that okay
 
03:52:52.070 --> 03:52:52.080 align:start position:0%
we are going to allow cryptocurrency we
 
03:52:54.870 --> 03:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
are going to allow this concept and we
 
03:52:57.269 --> 03:52:57.279 align:start position:0%
as a Commerce Committee decided to go
 
03:52:58.950 --> 03:52:58.960 align:start position:0%
and move forward with
 
03:53:03.550 --> 03:53:03.560 align:start position:0%
it isn't that we have to prove that that
 
03:53:07.910 --> 03:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
by looking at the progress of the states
 
03:53:10.149 --> 03:53:10.159 align:start position:0%
that they have done this thing correct
 
03:53:12.309 --> 03:53:12.319 align:start position:0%
they have done this thing wrong so we
 
03:53:15.389 --> 03:53:15.399 align:start position:0%
are going to do something better so I
 
03:53:18.550 --> 03:53:18.560 align:start position:0%
really don't see any kind of research
 
03:53:21.950 --> 03:53:21.960 align:start position:0%
getting into this bill that we need to
 
03:53:24.189 --> 03:53:24.199 align:start position:0%
push the Commission in because we have a
 
03:53:27.590 --> 03:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
lot of things to do so my concern is so
 
03:53:29.670 --> 03:53:29.680 align:start position:0%
you don't you don't like the bill no not
 
03:53:31.830 --> 03:53:31.840 align:start position:0%
like the bill my concern is
 
03:53:36.389 --> 03:53:36.399 align:start position:0%
basically how we can try to position
 
03:53:39.229 --> 03:53:39.239 align:start position:0%
ourself that New Hampshire being the
 
03:53:42.790 --> 03:53:42.800 align:start position:0%
sixth state in trying to Advocate the
 
03:53:46.110 --> 03:53:46.120 align:start position:0%
digital uh cryptocurrency see that yes
 
03:53:48.550 --> 03:53:48.560 align:start position:0%
we learn from these five states and we
 
03:53:52.030 --> 03:53:52.040 align:start position:0%
will be doing something like this so
 
03:53:54.710 --> 03:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
that the commission has some kind of a
 
03:53:56.750 --> 03:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
goal to achieve because we are just
 
03:53:58.189 --> 03:53:58.199 align:start position:0%
pushing it on the commission and we are
 
03:54:00.269 --> 03:54:00.279 align:start position:0%
saying that please figure it
 
03:54:02.510 --> 03:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
out so I don't think we're talking about
 
03:54:03.670 --> 03:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
the commission bill right now we're
 
03:54:04.950 --> 03:54:04.960 align:start position:0%
talking about we're talking about the
 
03:54:06.229 --> 03:54:06.239 align:start position:0%
other Bill we're talking about 302 the
 
03:54:08.269 --> 03:54:08.279 align:start position:0%
state treasur Bill okay yeah so you're
 
03:54:10.030 --> 03:54:10.040 align:start position:0%
talking about investing it right but I
 
03:54:12.349 --> 03:54:12.359 align:start position:0%
think let me let me be frank about both
 
03:54:14.870 --> 03:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
of these bills okay
 
03:54:18.070 --> 03:54:18.080 align:start position:0%
that the both of these bills
 
03:54:21.269 --> 03:54:21.279 align:start position:0%
are we're we're actually not doing
 
03:54:24.750 --> 03:54:24.760 align:start position:0%
anything other than saying these are
 
03:54:28.070 --> 03:54:28.080 align:start position:0%
things we can consider the commission is
 
03:54:29.710 --> 03:54:29.720 align:start position:0%
that we're giving them the task to
 
03:54:32.309 --> 03:54:32.319 align:start position:0%
figure out that if we were going to do
 
03:54:34.950 --> 03:54:34.960 align:start position:0%
something what would be the necessary
 
03:54:37.510 --> 03:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
legislative structure we need to create
 
03:54:40.950 --> 03:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
so they're going to be figuring out what
 
03:54:43.790 --> 03:54:43.800 align:start position:0%
what is out there what is good for us so
 
03:54:45.149 --> 03:54:45.159 align:start position:0%
the commission is going to do what
 
03:54:47.389 --> 03:54:47.399 align:start position:0%
you're asking for which is to go figure
 
03:54:50.149 --> 03:54:50.159 align:start position:0%
that out okay and then come back to us
 
03:54:52.469 --> 03:54:52.479 align:start position:0%
and they can come back and say nothing
 
03:54:54.670 --> 03:54:54.680 align:start position:0%
don't don't bother they can come back
 
03:54:57.630 --> 03:54:57.640 align:start position:0%
and say Here's what you need to do
 
03:55:00.670 --> 03:55:00.680 align:start position:0%
legislatively that seems to be working
 
03:55:01.790 --> 03:55:01.800 align:start position:0%
in other
 
03:55:05.070 --> 03:55:05.080 align:start position:0%
states or here's something that we think
 
03:55:06.590 --> 03:55:06.600 align:start position:0%
might work you know that we think should
 
03:55:10.389 --> 03:55:10.399 align:start position:0%
work will work and it will fit into the
 
03:55:12.349 --> 03:55:12.359 align:start position:0%
guidelines of how we operate in the
 
03:55:16.030 --> 03:55:16.040 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and this bill
 
03:55:18.070 --> 03:55:18.080 align:start position:0%
this is is absolutely the state
 
03:55:20.510 --> 03:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
treasurer the state treasurer has an
 
03:55:22.790 --> 03:55:22.800 align:start position:0%
obligation when she swore when we voted
 
03:55:25.670 --> 03:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
her in and you raise your right hand she
 
03:55:29.750 --> 03:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
had an obligation to best to
 
03:55:33.309 --> 03:55:33.319 align:start position:0%
preserve our Reserve our our funds
 
03:55:36.510 --> 03:55:36.520 align:start position:0%
reserves and not make any crazy
 
03:55:40.710 --> 03:55:40.720 align:start position:0%
Investments so she hands out this flyer
 
03:55:42.670 --> 03:55:42.680 align:start position:0%
which says this is the guidelines that
 
03:55:45.309 --> 03:55:45.319 align:start position:0%
what she's investing into and as
 
03:55:47.630 --> 03:55:47.640 align:start position:0%
representative M leer pointed out is
 
03:55:50.110 --> 03:55:50.120 align:start position:0%
that these are very safe
 
03:55:51.990 --> 03:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
instruments to the point that they're
 
03:55:54.149 --> 03:55:54.159 align:start position:0%
too safe and they're really they're
 
03:55:56.110 --> 03:55:56.120 align:start position:0%
really not going to you know you know
 
03:55:57.750 --> 03:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
they're not they're not breaking out of
 
03:56:00.630 --> 03:56:00.640 align:start position:0%
the mold of anything that is creative
 
03:56:04.469 --> 03:56:04.479 align:start position:0%
such as investing in precious metals or
 
03:56:08.349 --> 03:56:08.359 align:start position:0%
digital assets let alone buying IBM
 
03:56:13.070 --> 03:56:13.080 align:start position:0%
stock okay so that because you know she
 
03:56:15.510 --> 03:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
you know in the end of the day today
 
03:56:18.469 --> 03:56:18.479 align:start position:0%
what the standards for her when we talk
 
03:56:21.590 --> 03:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
about the Secretary of Treasury is the
 
03:56:23.070 --> 03:56:23.080 align:start position:0%
standards is
 
03:56:26.269 --> 03:56:26.279 align:start position:0%
Moody and Moody will will you know that
 
03:56:27.790 --> 03:56:27.800 align:start position:0%
what they're going to come in and look
 
03:56:30.309 --> 03:56:30.319 align:start position:0%
at what where the money is and what you
 
03:56:33.070 --> 03:56:33.080 align:start position:0%
know she's doing and saying you know
 
03:56:36.429 --> 03:56:36.439 align:start position:0%
here's your bond rating based on that so
 
03:56:38.149 --> 03:56:38.159 align:start position:0%
in this case what we're what we're doing
 
03:56:40.030 --> 03:56:40.040 align:start position:0%
with both of these things these
 
03:56:42.110 --> 03:56:42.120 align:start position:0%
legislation is that we're trying to be
 
03:56:44.990 --> 03:56:45.000 align:start position:0%
foresighted to say is okay how do we how
 
03:56:46.910 --> 03:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
do we make people think and feel warm
 
03:56:49.990 --> 03:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
fuzzies about New Hampshire being the
 
03:56:51.590 --> 03:56:51.600 align:start position:0%
Delaware of
 
03:56:55.149 --> 03:56:55.159 align:start position:0%
Corporations you okay the place where we
 
03:56:57.030 --> 03:56:57.040 align:start position:0%
would want to do business where we want
 
03:56:59.630 --> 03:56:59.640 align:start position:0%
to be incorporated where we want to
 
03:57:03.070 --> 03:57:03.080 align:start position:0%
business because the state is
 
03:57:06.349 --> 03:57:06.359 align:start position:0%
open-minded to look at these potential
 
03:57:08.309 --> 03:57:08.319 align:start position:0%
these digital assets and look at these
 
03:57:13.149 --> 03:57:13.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:15.910 --> 03:57:15.920 align:start position:0%
future is that good yeah that's a good
 
03:57:18.389 --> 03:57:18.399 align:start position:0%
explanation I just want to remind uh
 
03:57:20.910 --> 03:57:20.920 align:start position:0%
remind myself actually that uh on you'll
 
03:57:23.309 --> 03:57:23.319 align:start position:0%
see on page two of 30 House Bill 302
 
03:57:26.229 --> 03:57:26.239 align:start position:0%
page two line
 
03:57:30.790 --> 03:57:30.800 align:start position:0%
15 there's a a minimum size market
 
03:57:32.550 --> 03:57:32.560 align:start position:0%
capitalization for the digital asset so
 
03:57:35.510 --> 03:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
it's 500 billion which is a very um
 
03:57:38.510 --> 03:57:38.520 align:start position:0%
large number yes again you're don't
 
03:57:39.990 --> 03:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
speak to people speak to them I need my
 
03:57:43.149 --> 03:57:43.159 align:start position:0%
microphone louder yes anybody in the uh
 
03:57:44.950 --> 03:57:44.960 align:start position:0%
eat the control room
 
03:57:49.710 --> 03:57:49.720 align:start position:0%
there yeah um on House Bill 302 page two
 
03:57:53.870 --> 03:57:53.880 align:start position:0%
line uh 15 there's a a minimum number
 
03:57:55.469 --> 03:57:55.479 align:start position:0%
for a digital assets so we're not
 
03:57:58.630 --> 03:57:58.640 align:start position:0%
talking we're talking about 500 billion
 
03:57:59.630 --> 03:57:59.640 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna I'm GNA say we're talking
 
03:58:01.429 --> 03:58:01.439 align:start position:0%
about world class digital assets we're
 
03:58:04.110 --> 03:58:04.120 align:start position:0%
not talking about the junk at the bottom
 
03:58:05.670 --> 03:58:05.680 align:start position:0%
right we're talking
 
03:58:08.910 --> 03:58:08.920 align:start position:0%
about we can't buy any Trump coins no we
 
03:58:09.990 --> 03:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
the treasure would not be able to buy
 
03:58:13.309 --> 03:58:13.319 align:start position:0%
Trump coins so and it's a very liquid
 
03:58:16.149 --> 03:58:16.159 align:start position:0%
Global Market so there there's no I I
 
03:58:17.830 --> 03:58:17.840 align:start position:0%
don't think there's any you know real
 
03:58:19.830 --> 03:58:19.840 align:start position:0%
concern about liquidity in a market that
 
03:58:21.630 --> 03:58:21.640 align:start position:0%
size it's it's over $2 trillion doll
 
03:58:24.189 --> 03:58:24.199 align:start position:0%
right now Bitcoin right but it it
 
03:58:25.990 --> 03:58:26.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't prevent let's say there's some
 
03:58:28.110 --> 03:58:28.120 align:start position:0%
other coins that are on the Ascension
 
03:58:30.750 --> 03:58:30.760 align:start position:0%
like ethereum and salana are two of the
 
03:58:33.070 --> 03:58:33.080 align:start position:0%
the upand cominging ones neither of them
 
03:58:34.830 --> 03:58:34.840 align:start position:0%
satisfi that Threshold at this point in
 
03:58:36.750 --> 03:58:36.760 align:start position:0%
time but maybe at you know a few years
 
03:58:39.790 --> 03:58:39.800 align:start position:0%
into the future they may but that that
 
03:58:42.590 --> 03:58:42.600 align:start position:0%
market cap is uh important to keep in
 
03:58:42.600 --> 03:58:46.469 align:start position:0%
market cap is uh important to keep in
mind

03:58:46.469 --> 03:58:46.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:48.830 --> 03:58:48.840 align:start position:0%
okay I have
 
03:58:51.710 --> 03:58:51.720 align:start position:0%
question if it's about the budget
 
03:58:54.550 --> 03:58:54.560 align:start position:0%
Chris if you if you're going to start
 
03:58:57.630 --> 03:58:57.640 align:start position:0%
talking about uh this is ter or tell the
 
03:59:01.149 --> 03:59:01.159 align:start position:0%
treasurer about the the composition of
 
03:59:05.070 --> 03:59:05.080 align:start position:0%
the assets that we managed to have uh to
 
03:59:09.030 --> 03:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
me uh to be talking about ethereum and
 
03:59:11.830 --> 03:59:11.840 align:start position:0%
Bitcoin and and those kind of meme
 
03:59:15.750 --> 03:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
stocks is uh literally a waste of time
 
03:59:19.790 --> 03:59:19.800 align:start position:0%
we need we need more income that's the
 
03:59:22.590 --> 03:59:22.600 align:start position:0%
only cure okay so let's I we should be
 
03:59:24.670 --> 03:59:24.680 align:start position:0%
talking about again we're not we're
 
03:59:26.229 --> 03:59:26.239 align:start position:0%
talking about the rain day fund we're
 
03:59:28.910 --> 03:59:28.920 align:start position:0%
talking about if we're if we're suddenly
 
03:59:30.429 --> 03:59:30.439 align:start position:0%
doing so
 
03:59:33.910 --> 03:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
well and we're selling lots of liquor
 
03:59:36.269 --> 03:59:36.279 align:start position:0%
and we're and that we have you know
 
03:59:39.309 --> 03:59:39.319 align:start position:0%
suddenly have have more money than than
 
03:59:42.189 --> 03:59:42.199 align:start position:0%
you would can you imagine and we want to
 
03:59:46.590 --> 03:59:46.600 align:start position:0%
stash it away that if there is at that
 
03:59:48.910 --> 03:59:48.920 align:start position:0%
point in time in history which is not
 
03:59:51.670 --> 03:59:51.680 align:start position:0%
you know necessarily today that there is
 
03:59:53.630 --> 03:59:53.640 align:start position:0%
an uh capitalization market
 
03:59:56.630 --> 03:59:56.640 align:start position:0%
capitalization of an entity that is $500
 
03:59:56.640 --> 03:59:58.309 align:start position:0%
capitalization of an entity that is $500
billion

03:59:58.309 --> 03:59:58.319 align:start position:0%
billion
 
04:00:00.910 --> 04:00:00.920 align:start position:0%
doll would you say that she I'm not
 
04:00:03.910 --> 04:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
impressed I'm not impressed so it's uh
 
04:00:05.670 --> 04:00:05.680 align:start position:0%
what we need right now is something
 
04:00:08.630 --> 04:00:08.640 align:start position:0%
that's tangible and and the only you're
 
04:00:11.110 --> 04:00:11.120 align:start position:0%
looking short term I get it I am looking
 
04:00:14.469 --> 04:00:14.479 align:start position:0%
only term we need income
 
04:00:17.110 --> 04:00:17.120 align:start position:0%
so we need to we don't need to have tax
 
04:00:21.469 --> 04:00:21.479 align:start position:0%
cuts we need to have tax increases and
 
04:00:24.389 --> 04:00:24.399 align:start position:0%
and I'm saying we have an interest in
 
04:00:26.030 --> 04:00:26.040 align:start position:0%
dividends tax okay I think we had an
 
04:00:27.790 --> 04:00:27.800 align:start position:0%
election we actually decided that we
 
04:00:29.469 --> 04:00:29.479 align:start position:0%
were going to go with we're going to
 
04:00:31.750 --> 04:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
regret repeal the
 
04:00:35.030 --> 04:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
interest I have a question yes yes and
 
04:00:36.510 --> 04:00:36.520 align:start position:0%
you'll have to forgive me you may have
 
04:00:38.229 --> 04:00:38.239 align:start position:0%
already answered it but because I can't
 
04:00:39.910 --> 04:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
see your lips I don't have any clue what
 
04:00:43.990 --> 04:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
you're saying okay all right to yeah
 
04:00:45.870 --> 04:00:45.880 align:start position:0%
just talk to the mic I'm sorry don't
 
04:00:48.750 --> 04:00:48.760 align:start position:0%
talk to me talk to the
 
04:00:51.670 --> 04:00:51.680 align:start position:0%
mic we' were talking about being the
 
04:00:53.910 --> 04:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
investment especially for crypto being
 
04:00:56.110 --> 04:00:56.120 align:start position:0%
in the revenue stabilization which is
 
04:00:57.590 --> 04:00:57.600 align:start position:0%
the rainy day which we call the rainy
 
04:01:00.910 --> 04:01:00.920 align:start position:0%
day fund right but it also says well the
 
04:01:03.710 --> 04:01:03.720 align:start position:0%
property taxes the general fund that's
 
04:01:05.389 --> 04:01:05.399 align:start position:0%
part I'm having a problem
 
04:01:08.550 --> 04:01:08.560 align:start position:0%
with okay so you would want to Del lead
 
04:01:11.710 --> 04:01:11.720 align:start position:0%
from general fund or any other fund if
 
04:01:14.590 --> 04:01:14.600 align:start position:0%
St Revenue state for now the revenue
 
04:01:17.269 --> 04:01:17.279 align:start position:0%
stabilization fund is where that kind of
 
04:01:19.790 --> 04:01:19.800 align:start position:0%
investment or any other funds that is
 
04:01:22.750 --> 04:01:22.760 align:start position:0%
authorized by the legislature if we have
 
04:01:25.349 --> 04:01:25.359 align:start position:0%
something authorized right right now for
 
04:01:27.149 --> 04:01:27.159 align:start position:0%
this purposes of this bill it's the
 
04:01:29.510 --> 04:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund if we delete we delete
 
04:01:32.630 --> 04:01:32.640 align:start position:0%
yeah so over the previous year from the
 
04:01:35.149 --> 04:01:35.159 align:start position:0%
general fund right so you want to delete
 
04:01:36.830 --> 04:01:36.840 align:start position:0%
from the general fund from the re
 
04:01:39.550 --> 04:01:39.560 align:start position:0%
Revenue stabilization fund or any other
 
04:01:41.510 --> 04:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
funds that is authorized by the
 
04:01:43.670 --> 04:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
legislature which would be yes future
 
04:01:46.429 --> 04:01:46.439 align:start position:0%
okay are you okay with that delete ke
 
04:01:48.149 --> 04:01:48.159 align:start position:0%
I'd like to run it by the treasurer if
 
04:01:48.159 --> 04:01:49.030 align:start position:0%
I'd like to run it by the treasurer if
that's

04:01:49.030 --> 04:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:01:51.429 --> 04:01:51.439 align:start position:0%
okay I'd like to run it by the treasurer
 
04:01:53.990 --> 04:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
to see if she will give an opinion about
 
04:01:56.229 --> 04:01:56.239 align:start position:0%
striking that okay and uh one of the
 
04:01:59.189 --> 04:01:59.199 align:start position:0%
things in the conversation uh we talked
 
04:02:01.510 --> 04:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
about pensions and long-term funds you
 
04:02:03.070 --> 04:02:03.080 align:start position:0%
know they they need to be thinking about
 
04:02:05.229 --> 04:02:05.239 align:start position:0%
20 years into the future right pensions
 
04:02:07.750 --> 04:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
make sense sort of so I don't know if
 
04:02:07.760 --> 04:02:08.469 align:start position:0%
make sense sort of so I don't know if
the

04:02:08.469 --> 04:02:08.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:02:11.710 --> 04:02:11.720 align:start position:0%
language if we strike that if that would
 
04:02:13.469 --> 04:02:13.479 align:start position:0%
undermine that the problem of having
 
04:02:15.389 --> 04:02:15.399 align:start position:0%
working funds general fund no but I
 
04:02:17.750 --> 04:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
would think it it had to be some
 
04:02:19.429 --> 04:02:19.439 align:start position:0%
something we would then have
 
04:02:22.950 --> 04:02:22.960 align:start position:0%
to authorize by the legislature because
 
04:02:25.229 --> 04:02:25.239 align:start position:0%
right now we're just doing it says from
 
04:02:27.149 --> 04:02:27.159 align:start position:0%
general fund and the re R and the
 
04:02:29.030 --> 04:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
revenue stabilization
 
04:02:31.229 --> 04:02:31.239 align:start position:0%
fund so if we were going to do other
 
04:02:34.070 --> 04:02:34.080 align:start position:0%
funds in the future we would have to
 
04:02:35.510 --> 04:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
authorize it that would have to come
 
04:02:38.110 --> 04:02:38.120 align:start position:0%
back as a separate bill yes represent
 
04:02:39.670 --> 04:02:39.680 align:start position:0%
Keith when and there's good reason for
 
04:02:41.389 --> 04:02:41.399 align:start position:0%
that also because they are changing
 
04:02:42.830 --> 04:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
things at the federal level we don't
 
04:02:44.910 --> 04:02:44.920 align:start position:0%
know exactly where that's going makes
 
04:02:48.790 --> 04:02:48.800 align:start position:0%
perfect sense to me okay repr thank you
 
04:02:51.469 --> 04:02:51.479 align:start position:0%
Keith when you talk to the treasurer
 
04:02:53.070 --> 04:02:53.080 align:start position:0%
would you find out whether in fact they
 
04:02:56.550 --> 04:02:56.560 align:start position:0%
do allow equities in the Pension funds
 
04:02:58.550 --> 04:02:58.560 align:start position:0%
because it yeah certainly would you like
 
04:02:59.950 --> 04:02:59.960 align:start position:0%
maybe we can schedule appointment
 
04:03:01.910 --> 04:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
together and because you have much more
 
04:03:04.349 --> 04:03:04.359 align:start position:0%
financial expertise than I do so I I I
 
04:03:07.269 --> 04:03:07.279 align:start position:0%
think your bill here is sort of jumping
 
04:03:11.030 --> 04:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
over the logical next thing which is is
 
04:03:14.349 --> 04:03:14.359 align:start position:0%
equities right right ter okay
 
04:03:16.189 --> 04:03:16.199 align:start position:0%
so you guys will you guys will set up a
 
04:03:16.199 --> 04:03:17.910 align:start position:0%
so you guys will you guys will set up a
meeting

04:03:17.910 --> 04:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
04:03:20.710 --> 04:03:20.720 align:start position:0%
and Chris okay I think that would be
 
04:03:23.349 --> 04:03:23.359 align:start position:0%
perfect with the two of you I I don't
 
04:03:25.510 --> 04:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
think it should just be the two of them
 
04:03:28.309 --> 04:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
well you can come too I want to be there
 
04:03:30.269 --> 04:03:30.279 align:start position:0%
too yes
 
04:03:33.630 --> 04:03:33.640 align:start position:0%
okay okay then
 
04:03:35.830 --> 04:03:35.840 align:start position:0%
represent does anybody else would like
 
04:03:42.510 --> 04:03:42.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:45.030 --> 04:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
one okay you would be talking to the
 
04:03:47.229 --> 04:03:47.239 align:start position:0%

okay can I can I make one uh
 
04:04:44.670 --> 04:04:44.680 align:start position:0%
suggestion okay uh when we do the
 
04:04:46.910 --> 04:04:46.920 align:start position:0%
commissions two of this and two of that
 
04:04:48.670 --> 04:04:48.680 align:start position:0%
I would like to see a
 
04:04:51.710 --> 04:04:51.720 align:start position:0%
professional uh investor somebody uh
 
04:04:54.630 --> 04:04:54.640 align:start position:0%
that's going to do pro and con for us
 
04:04:56.790 --> 04:04:56.800 align:start position:0%
because I've had a a I have heard
 
04:05:00.670 --> 04:05:00.680 align:start position:0%
nothing about the stablecoin and Bitcoin
 
04:05:05.030 --> 04:05:05.040 align:start position:0%
that's uh con except for me and and I I
 
04:05:08.510 --> 04:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
know I know there's a big uh uh a very
 
04:05:12.550 --> 04:05:12.560 align:start position:0%
good argument on my side but I I don't
 
04:05:15.630 --> 04:05:15.640 align:start position:0%
think anybody here actually has ever has
 
04:05:17.870 --> 04:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
ever been exposed to it and I would like
 
04:05:21.309 --> 04:05:21.319 align:start position:0%
to see a professional uh person on like
 
04:05:24.349 --> 04:05:24.359 align:start position:0%
a Michael Hudson or somebody like that
 
04:05:26.149 --> 04:05:26.159 align:start position:0%
who absolutely knows but this is
 
04:05:28.070 --> 04:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
committee this is in our committee this
 
04:05:30.429 --> 04:05:30.439 align:start position:0%
is not a commission this is a committee
 
04:05:31.830 --> 04:05:31.840 align:start position:0%
it would be a lot cheaper to bring
 
04:05:34.070 --> 04:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
somebody in like that and we get the
 
04:05:37.229 --> 04:05:37.239 align:start position:0%
full dope okay may I just interu one
 
04:05:40.189 --> 04:05:40.199 align:start position:0%
thing you can invite them to the next
 
04:05:43.269 --> 04:05:43.279 align:start position:0%
subcommittee yes Keith so narrowing the
 
04:05:44.870 --> 04:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
scope of of what I think we're going to
 
04:05:46.269 --> 04:05:46.279 align:start position:0%
talk to the treasur about we're going to
 
04:05:50.349 --> 04:05:50.359 align:start position:0%
talk about removing general fund right
 
04:05:51.990 --> 04:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
leaving it in or removing it and we're
 
04:05:54.229 --> 04:05:54.239 align:start position:0%
going to talk about why isn't the list a
 
04:05:56.229 --> 04:05:56.239 align:start position:0%
little more expansive and and and those
 
04:05:59.349 --> 04:05:59.359 align:start position:0%
two those the pension fund and then and
 
04:06:01.510 --> 04:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
then and why aren't we
 
04:06:04.149 --> 04:06:04.159 align:start position:0%
including uh
 
04:06:06.670 --> 04:06:06.680 align:start position:0%
stocks why aren't we including stocks
 
04:06:09.309 --> 04:06:09.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:13.670 --> 04:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
is in the PCH right limited to well it
 
04:06:15.149 --> 04:06:15.159 align:start position:0%
has mutual funds but it's limited to a
 
04:06:17.750 --> 04:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
fixed income mutual funds why why aren't
 
04:06:20.110 --> 04:06:20.120 align:start position:0%
we Mr Ken why aren't we including
 
04:06:23.389 --> 04:06:23.399 align:start position:0%
stocks okay I think those are great
 
04:06:29.149 --> 04:06:29.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:29.159 --> 04:06:34.469 align:start position:0%
 
310

04:06:34.469 --> 04:06:34.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:37.309 --> 04:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
okay all right so the 310 is just a
 
04:06:37.319 --> 04:06:40.189 align:start position:0%
okay all right so the 310 is just a
study

04:06:40.189 --> 04:06:40.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:44.990 --> 04:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:10.590 --> 04:07:10.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:18.269 --> 04:07:18.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:18.279 --> 04:07:28.189 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:07:28.189 --> 04:07:28.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:30.870 --> 04:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
um all right so is there anybody in the
 
04:07:32.510 --> 04:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
audience who represents an organization
 
04:07:36.870 --> 04:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:39.990 --> 04:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
commission how expert do you have to be
 
04:07:41.990 --> 04:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
how expert do you have to be you don't
 
04:07:45.030 --> 04:07:45.040 align:start position:0%
have to have any expertise
 
04:07:48.710 --> 04:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
right I mean we we have well I I do see
 
04:07:50.309 --> 04:07:50.319 align:start position:0%
that there has three members of the
 
04:07:51.910 --> 04:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
House of Representative appointed by the
 
04:07:55.550 --> 04:07:55.560 align:start position:0%
speaker so if you would like to increase
 
04:07:57.389 --> 04:07:57.399 align:start position:0%
the chance that you get
 
04:08:00.790 --> 04:08:00.800 align:start position:0%
appointed we uh it would not be unusual
 
04:08:04.429 --> 04:08:04.439 align:start position:0%
for us to say um certain amount of those
 
04:08:06.710 --> 04:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
members would be from the Commerce
 
04:08:08.870 --> 04:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
Committee I I would have no problem
 
04:08:11.510 --> 04:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
doing it with the understanding that I'm
 
04:08:13.269 --> 04:08:13.279 align:start position:0%
not a stock broker or any of those kind
 
04:08:15.550 --> 04:08:15.560 align:start position:0%
of things but I can do research better
 
04:08:18.469 --> 04:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
than it and gang
 
04:08:18.479 --> 04:08:21.670 align:start position:0%
than it and gang
busters

04:08:21.670 --> 04:08:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:25.950 --> 04:08:25.960 align:start position:0%
right yes represent BR my concern is and
 
04:08:27.830 --> 04:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
how could we alleviate that Reg great if
 
04:08:28.830 --> 04:08:28.840 align:start position:0%
they're members of the Commerce
 
04:08:30.590 --> 04:08:30.600 align:start position:0%
Committee that I mean we've had some
 
04:08:33.030 --> 04:08:33.040 align:start position:0%
commissions that were I don't for lack
 
04:08:34.950 --> 04:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
of a better word stacked in One
 
04:08:37.790 --> 04:08:37.800 align:start position:0%
Direction or another so how can we Ure I
 
04:08:39.309 --> 04:08:39.319 align:start position:0%
like the idea of having an independent
 
04:08:42.309 --> 04:08:42.319 align:start position:0%
expert um uh can we can we make how can
 
04:08:44.710 --> 04:08:44.720 align:start position:0%
we make thaten got figure out who that
 
04:08:46.349 --> 04:08:46.359 align:start position:0%
how how you want to describe that person
 
04:08:48.109 --> 04:08:48.119 align:start position:0%
and make sure they get appointed so like
 
04:08:52.510 --> 04:08:52.520 align:start position:0%
I say that um if if we wrote uh you it
 
04:08:53.590 --> 04:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
says three members of the House of
 
04:08:55.710 --> 04:08:55.720 align:start position:0%
Representatives and two of which is from
 
04:08:59.189 --> 04:08:59.199 align:start position:0%
the Commerce Committee I can guarantee
 
04:09:02.790 --> 04:09:02.800 align:start position:0%
you that I would uh appoint oh you get
 
04:09:04.630 --> 04:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
to appoint them the speaker would come
 
04:09:06.950 --> 04:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
to me he would I'm sorry say that the
 
04:09:14.109 --> 04:09:14.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:19.910 --> 04:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:22.429 --> 04:09:22.439 align:start position:0%
two least
 
04:09:22.439 --> 04:09:24.109 align:start position:0%
two least

04:09:24.109 --> 04:09:24.119 align:start position:0%
two
 
04:09:27.590 --> 04:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
from the Commerce Committee I'd like to
 
04:09:30.309 --> 04:09:30.319 align:start position:0%
make a comment if I could
 
04:09:32.910 --> 04:09:32.920 align:start position:0%
yep the results of the Dow commission
 
04:09:36.429 --> 04:09:36.439 align:start position:0%
that uh happened last year or the final
 
04:09:39.550 --> 04:09:39.560 align:start position:0%
thing came out last year was actually
 
04:09:42.710 --> 04:09:42.720 align:start position:0%
quite good I mean the the the results of
 
04:09:45.269 --> 04:09:45.279 align:start position:0%
that d commiss were good the bill that
 
04:09:48.550 --> 04:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
we passed out of the house was quite
 
04:09:50.910 --> 04:09:50.920 align:start position:0%
good the bill that came out of the
 
04:09:53.109 --> 04:09:53.119 align:start position:0%
Senate after it got edited took a few
 
04:09:55.229 --> 04:09:55.239 align:start position:0%
things out that I did not particularly
 
04:09:57.389 --> 04:09:57.399 align:start position:0%
like but that's going to happen with any
 
04:09:59.710 --> 04:09:59.720 align:start position:0%
bill and it's not the fault of the
 
04:10:01.590 --> 04:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
commission because the commission
 
04:10:04.389 --> 04:10:04.399 align:start position:0%
actually as I said they did a good job
 
04:10:06.990 --> 04:10:07.000 align:start position:0%
uh I'm hoping that we have the same kind
 
04:10:09.670 --> 04:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
of quality at least the same kind of
 
04:10:13.870 --> 04:10:13.880 align:start position:0%
quality as we had on the Dow Commission
 
04:10:15.229 --> 04:10:15.239 align:start position:0%
because if we can get that something
 
04:10:19.269 --> 04:10:19.279 align:start position:0%
that good and by the way I did look at a
 
04:10:20.950 --> 04:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
bunch of the states
 
04:10:23.910 --> 04:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
and there's eight states that are
 
04:10:25.389 --> 04:10:25.399 align:start position:0%
setting up these commissions have
 
04:10:27.389 --> 04:10:27.399 align:start position:0%
already started setting them up so it's
 
04:10:31.070 --> 04:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:33.269 --> 04:10:33.279 align:start position:0%
this okay
 
04:10:37.269 --> 04:10:37.279 align:start position:0%
great um and uh did you notice in terms
 
04:10:39.189 --> 04:10:39.199 align:start position:0%
of who they had on their commission that
 
04:10:41.670 --> 04:10:41.680 align:start position:0%
that we don't have on ours or anybody
 
04:10:43.349 --> 04:10:43.359 align:start position:0%
that you think should be add I looked at
 
04:10:45.229 --> 04:10:45.239 align:start position:0%
I can give you that list because I don't
 
04:10:46.870 --> 04:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
remember and I didn't bother to write it
 
04:10:49.269 --> 04:10:49.279 align:start position:0%
down but I have the list at home okay
 
04:10:51.429 --> 04:10:51.439 align:start position:0%
and I can bring it in and but it's kind
 
04:10:54.109 --> 04:10:54.119 align:start position:0%
of similar the way we have it although
 
04:10:55.910 --> 04:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
one state did say they were going to
 
04:10:58.349 --> 04:10:58.359 align:start position:0%
hire professionals to be on the
 
04:11:00.030 --> 04:11:00.040 align:start position:0%
commission but we don't have a fiscal
 
04:11:03.990 --> 04:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
note with this no no so I don't know how
 
04:11:06.710 --> 04:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
we would hire anybody right if they if
 
04:11:08.030 --> 04:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
they need to hire somebody they'll have
 
04:11:10.990 --> 04:11:11.000 align:start position:0%
to come back and and get so actually
 
04:11:15.630 --> 04:11:15.640 align:start position:0%
that that leads to to my point is um the
 
04:11:19.750 --> 04:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
sunset is uh 2025 November 20 and I I
 
04:11:21.149 --> 04:11:21.159 align:start position:0%
would say we should push that out of a
 
04:11:22.870 --> 04:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
year because it's going to take a long
 
04:11:24.630 --> 04:11:24.640 align:start position:0%
time to get the appointments made and I
 
04:11:26.469 --> 04:11:26.479 align:start position:0%
don't want I think that we should give
 
04:11:28.229 --> 04:11:28.239 align:start position:0%
them the full buy any name I had this
 
04:11:30.950 --> 04:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
similar feeling that three months is a
 
04:11:32.950 --> 04:11:32.960 align:start position:0%
it's a big bite to chew in three months
 
04:11:35.550 --> 04:11:35.560 align:start position:0%
okay so let's go
 
04:11:38.429 --> 04:11:38.439 align:start position:0%
2026 we we may want to uh and then and
 
04:11:39.870 --> 04:11:39.880 align:start position:0%
then the
 
04:11:41.830 --> 04:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
repeal is
 
04:11:46.109 --> 04:11:46.119 align:start position:0%
2026 so L 23 on page first page of the
 
04:11:49.349 --> 04:11:49.359 align:start position:0%
bill we may want to bump it up to
 
04:11:52.710 --> 04:11:52.720 align:start position:0%
two blockchains yeah two people that are
 
04:11:55.349 --> 04:11:55.359 align:start position:0%
familiar with the technology right okay
 
04:11:57.389 --> 04:11:57.399 align:start position:0%
I think we could find those based on
 
04:11:59.630 --> 04:11:59.640 align:start position:0%
what it was on the governor's commission
 
04:12:03.349 --> 04:12:03.359 align:start position:0%
okay good what's the technology you just
 
04:12:06.469 --> 04:12:06.479 align:start position:0%
cited is this the Bitcoin business no
 
04:12:09.149 --> 04:12:09.159 align:start position:0%
this is uh it would be for stable a
 
04:12:11.830 --> 04:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
stable token and that's recorded on the
 
04:12:13.229 --> 04:12:13.239 align:start position:0%
blockchain so the technology is
 
04:12:15.550 --> 04:12:15.560 align:start position:0%
blockchain but there's also financial
 
04:12:16.990 --> 04:12:17.000 align:start position:0%
pieces to it you know traditional
 
04:12:18.670 --> 04:12:18.680 align:start position:0%
financial pieces to
 
04:12:21.790 --> 04:12:21.800 align:start position:0%
it again I uh I that that doesn't
 
04:12:25.389 --> 04:12:25.399 align:start position:0%
qualify in my mind uh what kind of uh
 
04:12:26.910 --> 04:12:26.920 align:start position:0%
information we need to have at the
 
04:12:26.920 --> 04:12:28.710 align:start position:0%
information we need to have at the
professional

04:12:28.710 --> 04:12:28.720 align:start position:0%
professional
 
04:12:32.630 --> 04:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
level uh well um your your homework
 
04:12:35.070 --> 04:12:35.080 align:start position:0%
assignment is to figure out who you
 
04:12:38.670 --> 04:12:38.680 align:start position:0%
think is the right person and we'll put
 
04:12:42.189 --> 04:12:42.199 align:start position:0%
them on I have a bunch of names but uh
 
04:12:44.269 --> 04:12:44.279 align:start position:0%
don't ask don't ask you go ask those
 
04:12:46.109 --> 04:12:46.119 align:start position:0%
names ask those
 
04:12:48.670 --> 04:12:48.680 align:start position:0%
people what is their nature of their
 
04:12:50.630 --> 04:12:50.640 align:start position:0%
expertise so that we can get them
 
04:12:52.990 --> 04:12:53.000 align:start position:0%
appointed we don't you I've never seen a
 
04:12:54.349 --> 04:12:54.359 align:start position:0%
commission where we actually put
 
04:12:57.030 --> 04:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
somebody's name down on the commission
 
04:12:59.389 --> 04:12:59.399 align:start position:0%
we would have what is their title what
 
04:13:02.710 --> 04:13:02.720 align:start position:0%
is their Prof and and we'll we'll add
 
04:13:02.720 --> 04:13:03.590 align:start position:0%
is their Prof and and we'll we'll add
them

04:13:03.590 --> 04:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:13:06.149 --> 04:13:06.159 align:start position:0%
to on the list well I could make a list
 
04:13:08.149 --> 04:13:08.159 align:start position:0%
but I'm not going to go around and call
 
04:13:10.269 --> 04:13:10.279 align:start position:0%
uh and do that work I'm just not going
 
04:13:12.269 --> 04:13:12.279 align:start position:0%
to and by the way they're going to cost
 
04:13:12.279 --> 04:13:14.550 align:start position:0%
to and by the way they're going to cost
money

04:13:14.550 --> 04:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
money
 
04:13:16.710 --> 04:13:16.720 align:start position:0%
well then then they really don't care
 
04:13:18.950 --> 04:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
about this problem then if they're if
 
04:13:20.030 --> 04:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
they're going to cost money they're
 
04:13:22.229 --> 04:13:22.239 align:start position:0%
going to just shake us down to be on a
 
04:13:24.070 --> 04:13:24.080 align:start position:0%
committee to to help us set the
 
04:13:26.149 --> 04:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
framework then then no they're experts
 
04:13:28.189 --> 04:13:28.199 align:start position:0%
in in what we talk about well if they're
 
04:13:30.229 --> 04:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
an expert that they would want to be on
 
04:13:30.239 --> 04:13:31.269 align:start position:0%
an expert that they would want to be on
this

04:13:31.269 --> 04:13:31.279 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:13:33.910 --> 04:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
commission I don't everyone I know is
 
04:13:37.070 --> 04:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
not from New Hampshire so oh so nobody
 
04:13:38.910 --> 04:13:38.920 align:start position:0%
you w have anybody from New
 
04:13:41.229 --> 04:13:41.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire not yet I mean I would have to
 
04:13:44.030 --> 04:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
go to some go to your friends and ask
 
04:13:45.550 --> 04:13:45.560 align:start position:0%
him who's somebody from New Hampshire
 
04:13:46.630 --> 04:13:46.640 align:start position:0%
who could be
 
04:13:48.910 --> 04:13:48.920 align:start position:0%
pointed I wouldn't trust it I don't like
 
04:13:51.590 --> 04:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
the politics here no really this is a
 
04:13:54.309 --> 04:13:54.319 align:start position:0%

else Academia it does have I did see uh
 
04:15:08.349 --> 04:15:08.359 align:start position:0%
I said yeah yeah 27 one represented for
 
04:15:10.429 --> 04:15:10.439 align:start position:0%
the academic Community with expertise in
 
04:15:13.550 --> 04:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
financial regulation that's un or block
 
04:15:17.630 --> 04:15:17.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:20.750 --> 04:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
technology yeah we have that UNH
 
04:15:24.950 --> 04:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
commission there were two it says
 
04:15:27.510 --> 04:15:27.520 align:start position:0%
or uh one represented from an economic
 
04:15:29.790 --> 04:15:29.800 align:start position:0%
Community with an expertise in financial
 
04:15:39.590 --> 04:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:39.600 --> 04:15:41.630 align:start position:0%
 
technology

04:15:41.630 --> 04:15:41.640 align:start position:0%
technology
 
04:15:44.229 --> 04:15:44.239 align:start position:0%
okay will you sending out an amendment
 
04:15:45.630 --> 04:15:45.640 align:start position:0%
or something that says what we all
 
04:15:49.070 --> 04:15:49.080 align:start position:0%
agreed to here so the next step is is
 
04:15:52.229 --> 04:15:52.239 align:start position:0%
taking what we've discussed here and we
 
04:15:54.710 --> 04:15:54.720 align:start position:0%
would have the Amendments drawn
 
04:15:58.710 --> 04:15:58.720 align:start position:0%
up but that I I I I can't emphasize
 
04:16:03.269 --> 04:16:03.279 align:start position:0%
enough that I'm open to um anything in
 
04:16:04.990 --> 04:16:05.000 align:start position:0%
terms of what the commission shall study
 
04:16:05.990 --> 04:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
and make
 
04:16:08.030 --> 04:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
recommendations read that list if you
 
04:16:09.750 --> 04:16:09.760 align:start position:0%
see something that you would like them
 
04:16:13.189 --> 04:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
to be focused on you need to get that to
 
04:16:14.309 --> 04:16:14.319 align:start position:0%
me and
 
04:16:18.389 --> 04:16:18.399 align:start position:0%
Keith okay so any any of the tasks or
 
04:16:21.870 --> 04:16:21.880 align:start position:0%
the Warm Bodies if you anybody has a
 
04:16:24.990 --> 04:16:25.000 align:start position:0%
brilliant idea police get it to Keith
 
04:16:27.469 --> 04:16:27.479 align:start position:0%
and then we will have it and then by the
 
04:16:29.830 --> 04:16:29.840 align:start position:0%
time you know once I've coated that
 
04:16:31.349 --> 04:16:31.359 align:start position:0%
we'll have the amendment drawn up and
 
04:16:32.670 --> 04:16:32.680 align:start position:0%
then I'll call another subcomm do you
 
04:16:33.990 --> 04:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
want me to put together everything that
 
04:16:35.229 --> 04:16:35.239 align:start position:0%
the other states are doing in their
 
04:16:37.469 --> 04:16:37.479 align:start position:0%
commissions I what I mostly particularly
 
04:16:39.670 --> 04:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
interested is hearing what you think out
 
04:16:43.510 --> 04:16:43.520 align:start position:0%
of after your analysis of that
 
04:16:45.070 --> 04:16:45.080 align:start position:0%
which items in there do you think we
 
04:16:47.510 --> 04:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
need to add can I have until tomorrow or
 
04:16:50.189 --> 04:16:50.199 align:start position:0%
you have a week two weeks can I just
 
04:16:52.149 --> 04:16:52.159 align:start position:0%
sure interject one we're not we're this
 
04:16:54.109 --> 04:16:54.119 align:start position:0%
this is not an early bill so and I'm
 
04:16:56.550 --> 04:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
only going to and I'm only going to uh
 
04:16:58.670 --> 04:16:58.680 align:start position:0%
include those that have actually passed
 
04:17:01.429 --> 04:17:01.439 align:start position:0%
legislation that's fine that's great so
 
04:17:03.750 --> 04:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
I we we don't want to we don't want to
 
04:17:05.510 --> 04:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
micromanage the duties of the commission
 
04:17:07.429 --> 04:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
too much but one of the tasks could be
 
04:17:08.830 --> 04:17:08.840 align:start position:0%
to investigate what the other states are
 
04:17:11.030 --> 04:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
doing and include that in we could that
 
04:17:13.109 --> 04:17:13.119 align:start position:0%
that keep it keep it simple and but I
 
04:17:14.349 --> 04:17:14.359 align:start position:0%
don't I don't mind putting together a
 
04:17:16.349 --> 04:17:16.359 align:start position:0%
list just so that we have it I mean
 
04:17:19.149 --> 04:17:19.159 align:start position:0%
that'll come in super handy
 
04:17:21.349 --> 04:17:21.359 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so what what is this bill
 
04:17:25.550 --> 04:17:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:29.109 --> 04:17:29.119 align:start position:0%
310 okay this is not a early bill so we
 
04:17:32.229 --> 04:17:32.239 align:start position:0%

04:18:38.109 --> 04:18:38.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:45.670 --> 04:18:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:48.429 --> 04:18:48.439 align:start position:0%
okay all right so as some of you were
 
04:18:52.030 --> 04:18:52.040 align:start position:0%
here this morning you I'm not too
 
04:18:54.510 --> 04:18:54.520 align:start position:0%
anxious to kill things I want to make
 
04:18:57.349 --> 04:18:57.359 align:start position:0%
sure that if they watch the tape they
 
04:18:58.710 --> 04:18:58.720 align:start position:0%
know that
 
04:19:02.630 --> 04:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
we did did due diligence we didn't just
 
04:19:04.710 --> 04:19:04.720 align:start position:0%
kill it because nobody showed up so
 
04:19:08.030 --> 04:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
let's tell us why you don't like this
 
04:19:11.429 --> 04:19:11.439 align:start position:0%
bill I will sure the Department of
 
04:19:11.439 --> 04:19:13.550 align:start position:0%
bill I will sure the Department of
Justice

04:19:13.550 --> 04:19:13.560 align:start position:0%
Justice
 
04:19:15.710 --> 04:19:15.720 align:start position:0%
the bankers Association the domestic
 
04:19:17.910 --> 04:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
insurance representativ State Farm
 
04:19:20.429 --> 04:19:20.439 align:start position:0%
Insurance All State Insurance social
 
04:19:22.189 --> 04:19:22.199 align:start position:0%
responsibility organization and
 
04:19:24.950 --> 04:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
sustainability group all opposed the
 
04:19:26.710 --> 04:19:26.720 align:start position:0%
bill and said that it was
 
04:19:29.349 --> 04:19:29.359 align:start position:0%
essentially uh against free trade and a
 
04:19:31.990 --> 04:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
bunch of other things that they said and
 
04:19:34.469 --> 04:19:34.479 align:start position:0%
when the dog already doj says that they
 
04:19:37.229 --> 04:19:37.239 align:start position:0%
don't like it the bankers don't like
 
04:19:40.229 --> 04:19:40.239 align:start position:0%
it I don't know I nobody lik it and I
 
04:19:43.149 --> 04:19:43.159 align:start position:0%
don't like it I I don't think this
 
04:19:45.030 --> 04:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
I don't think this belongs in the Live
 
04:19:48.710 --> 04:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:54.070 --> 04:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
State okay you move IPL I I'm I'm do I
 
04:19:55.910 --> 04:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
feel like you're okay so our first
 
04:19:58.389 --> 04:19:58.399 align:start position:0%
rationale is we is that no one actually
 
04:20:01.950 --> 04:20:01.960 align:start position:0%
came in and spoke for the bill right
 
04:20:03.830 --> 04:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
which is not a good thing was all
 
04:20:03.840 --> 04:20:05.670 align:start position:0%
which is not a good thing was all
negatives

04:20:05.670 --> 04:20:05.680 align:start position:0%
negatives
 
04:20:07.910 --> 04:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
anybody speak for the bill right I
 
04:20:10.790 --> 04:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
already posed that question no notice
 
04:20:16.790 --> 04:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:23.429 --> 04:20:23.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:23.439 --> 04:20:25.670 align:start position:0%
 
department

04:20:25.670 --> 04:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
department
 
04:20:29.590 --> 04:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
yes so I I also don't think this bill is
 
04:20:33.109 --> 04:20:33.119 align:start position:0%
ready for prime time um there there is a
 
04:20:35.030 --> 04:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
legitimate issue behind this bill I
 
04:20:38.830 --> 04:20:38.840 align:start position:0%
think um there was a and I think I
 
04:20:42.189 --> 04:20:42.199 align:start position:0%
shared this with with uh some of you
 
04:20:45.189 --> 04:20:45.199 align:start position:0%
that uh uh Mark andreon who's a big
 
04:20:47.229 --> 04:20:47.239 align:start position:0%
investor was recently on The Joe Rogan
 
04:20:49.670 --> 04:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
podcast this is maybe a month ago and he
 
04:20:51.229 --> 04:20:51.239 align:start position:0%
talked about how all these Tech
 
04:20:52.550 --> 04:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
investors were being
 
04:20:55.149 --> 04:20:55.159 align:start position:0%
debanked and once he came came out and
 
04:20:58.590 --> 04:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
publicly stated that a lot of the other
 
04:21:01.349 --> 04:21:01.359 align:start position:0%
you know Founders and innovators were
 
04:21:02.830 --> 04:21:02.840 align:start position:0%
saying that they were also be being
 
04:21:05.710 --> 04:21:05.720 align:start position:0%
debanked that they they uh some of them
 
04:21:09.389 --> 04:21:09.399 align:start position:0%
had to like not even pursue their their
 
04:21:11.550 --> 04:21:11.560 align:start position:0%
uh you know building a company because
 
04:21:12.990 --> 04:21:13.000 align:start position:0%
they couldn't find a bank that would
 
04:21:15.670 --> 04:21:15.680 align:start position:0%
Bank them so I I think there is an issue
 
04:21:17.149 --> 04:21:17.159 align:start position:0%
but I don't know if the government can
 
04:21:19.229 --> 04:21:19.239 align:start position:0%
solve it at the state level I think it's
 
04:21:21.429 --> 04:21:21.439 align:start position:0%
going to be a federal they have to clean
 
04:21:23.309 --> 04:21:23.319 align:start position:0%
this up at the federal level and and I
 
04:21:26.670 --> 04:21:26.680 align:start position:0%
think that's going to happen um he'll
 
04:21:29.830 --> 04:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
try right um so I want to just give some
 
04:21:29.840 --> 04:21:30.910 align:start position:0%
try right um so I want to just give some
Credence

04:21:30.910 --> 04:21:30.920 align:start position:0%
Credence
 
04:21:33.389 --> 04:21:33.399 align:start position:0%
to the intentions behind the bill I
 
04:21:35.309 --> 04:21:35.319 align:start position:0%
think there are some sound intentions
 
04:21:38.630 --> 04:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
but this particular bill I don't see us
 
04:21:43.070 --> 04:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
uh us wanting to pass it yeah no I I
 
04:21:45.030 --> 04:21:45.040 align:start position:0%
agree that every every bill has a grain
 
04:21:48.510 --> 04:21:48.520 align:start position:0%
of truth to it and uh and and a
 
04:21:52.229 --> 04:21:52.239 align:start position:0%
rationale for why um you know what why
 
04:21:54.990 --> 04:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
something go through and and a lot of
 
04:21:57.630 --> 04:21:57.640 align:start position:0%
you in terms of you say debanked or
 
04:21:59.469 --> 04:21:59.479 align:start position:0%
accusations that certain things are
 
04:22:03.429 --> 04:22:03.439 align:start position:0%
going on um
 
04:22:07.469 --> 04:22:07.479 align:start position:0%
but in terms of um you know in our case
 
04:22:10.510 --> 04:22:10.520 align:start position:0%
we we have state chartered Banks and I'm
 
04:22:13.389 --> 04:22:13.399 align:start position:0%
sure that the de banking is not
 
04:22:15.070 --> 04:22:15.080 align:start position:0%
occurring so much in our state Charter
 
04:22:16.269 --> 04:22:16.279 align:start position:0%
Banks it was going to be it's going to
 
04:22:18.830 --> 04:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
be a bigger bank and I'm pretty sure
 
04:22:21.550 --> 04:22:21.560 align:start position:0%
those bigger Banks um are not active in
 
04:22:23.189 --> 04:22:23.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire anyways it's federally
 
04:22:26.429 --> 04:22:26.439 align:start position:0%
chared Banks um in terms of the
 
04:22:28.510 --> 04:22:28.520 align:start position:0%
insurance portion of the
 
04:22:31.149 --> 04:22:31.159 align:start position:0%
bill it it seemed like they they got
 
04:22:34.030 --> 04:22:34.040 align:start position:0%
dragged into something that really
 
04:22:37.510 --> 04:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
wasn't you know not not their fault um
 
04:22:39.429 --> 04:22:39.439 align:start position:0%
you know I think I I because I saw this
 
04:22:41.630 --> 04:22:41.640 align:start position:0%
more is more of a financial it's a
 
04:22:43.469 --> 04:22:43.479 align:start position:0%
banking bill than than an insurance bill
 
04:22:46.349 --> 04:22:46.359 align:start position:0%
and and it seemed un unfortunate that
 
04:22:49.269 --> 04:22:49.279 align:start position:0%
insurance got thrown into it
 
04:22:52.990 --> 04:22:53.000 align:start position:0%
also but um we know insurance has a
 
04:22:56.590 --> 04:22:56.600 align:start position:0%
problem when it comes to nonprofits
 
04:23:01.590 --> 04:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:01.600 --> 04:23:03.469 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:23:03.469 --> 04:23:03.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:23:09.269 --> 04:23:09.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:12.790 --> 04:23:12.800 align:start position:0%
