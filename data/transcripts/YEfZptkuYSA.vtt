Good.

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,500
I guess I'm going to say this.

30
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,500
Thanks.

31
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,500

34
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,500

If you find you need anything, give us a shot.

37
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,500
All right.

38
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,500
Thank you.

39
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,500
Here you go.

40
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,500
Thank you.

41
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,500
Thank you.

42
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,500
Thank you.

43
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,500
Thank you.

44
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,500
Thank you.

45
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,500
Thank you.

46
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,500
Thank you.

47
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,500
Thank you.

48
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,500
Thank you.

49
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,500
Thank you.

50
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,500
Thank you.

51
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,500
Thank you.

52
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,500
Thank you.

53
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,500
Thank you.

54
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,500
Thank you.

55
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,500
Thank you.

56
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,500
Thank you.

57
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:06,000
I understand that it's hard to keep...

58
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,500
Well, especially if they don't show up.

59
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:17,000
You know, supposedly this whole process is supposed to teach them, you know, personal responsibility.

60
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
We struggle with that at the community mental health center.

61
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Okay.

62
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So let's get started.

63
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
All right.

64
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,500
You're going to speak first.

65
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,500
No, I'm going to speak first.

66
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,500
But you'll be next.

67
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,500
Make sure the red light's on.

68
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:47,500
I don't know if you saw in your email, but we do have a new one with removable.

69
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,500
All right.

70
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,000
I need a copy of the amendment.

71
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,500
He's giving them to everybody.

72
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,500
Thank you.

73
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:57,000
saw in your email we do have a new one with removable all right i i need a copy of the amendment but he's giving him to everybody you see his hand on my phone yeah put one in the record thank you thanks so we'll open the work session for sb 422 fn and i'm going to start if that's okay to describe an amendment that mr ripple is putting forth at this point in time and i'm going to summarize by saying the goal that Representative Edwards and Senator Bradley and Senator Rosenwald came to is to make the SB 422 bill we're looking at the same as the HB 103 bill that's currently in the Senate.

74
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And from our point of view, What that means is you have in front of you this amendment to SB 422, and you'll note that it replaces the entire bill, 422, and what it's essentially replacing it with is HB 103 with three changes.

75
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:34,500
So those changes, the first one is on page two, line 35, where the word removable has been added at the beginning of number four, removable procedentic coverage for individuals,, dot.

76
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:41,500
And that is agreed to by the department and by the sponsor of HG103.

77
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:51,500
And I think hopefully it'll be all up by all of us, but also by Senator Rosenwald and Senator Bradley.

78
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:59,500
The next change then is down on the next page, page 3, line 6, part C.

79
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:05,500
To the beginning of that exception line, the words â€“ oh, right.

80
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,000
Looking at the wrong one.

81
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:23,000
The words, the beginning of that line, the words, with the exception of diagnostic and preventive services, cost sharing shall be implemented to the maximum extent allowable, dot, dot, dot.

82
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:37,000
So essentially, the cost sharing part was already in there, and this is just saying that it does not apply in the case of diagnostic and preventive services.

83
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:45,500
And then the third change relates to something that we were discussing when we did HB 103.

84
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:55,000
We did not understand what the risk corridor calculation was for which the Senate had budgeted about $2.4 million.

85
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,500
And so the Senate language is now incorporated into HB 103.

86
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,500
So that's now part of the entire bill.

87
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,500
Where is that deleted?

88
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,500
Oh, I'm sorry.

89
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,500
Yeah, lines.

90
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:16,000
So that is lines 17, basically all the way through 28.

91
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Is it?

92
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's been removed.

93
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
No.

94
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
So, right.

95
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:33,000
So, we took out the 2.4 million from HB 103, and we had it going to general funds.

96
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,500
Now we've put it back in, and it's not going to general funds.

97
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:50,000
It's going to payback CMS, and we're going to hear more about exactly what that's about in just a moment here.

98
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,500
But first of all, I'll let Representative Shapiro have the floor.

99
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:04,000
Thank you very much and I want to thank everyone who's done endless work on this bill.

100
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:15,500
So many twists and turns and amendments and of course many people have been working on this for years and years and years.

101
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:27,500
So I just want to talk about one specific change since the idea is to make Senate Bill 422 identical to House Bill 103.

102
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:46,000
When House Bill 103 left this committee, it had a certain kind of cost sharing, certain kind of co-payment, and it's coming back in a slightly different form, so I just want to explain how that happened.

103
00:07:46,000 --> 00:08:04,500
So when we went to present this bill to the Senate, Health and Human Services, some of the stakeholders had brought up the possibility of changing to, of excluding the cost sharing for diagnostic and preventative care.

104
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:11,000
And I was very reluctant to make any changes at the last minute.

105
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I thought we had something that everyone agreed with, and I certainly didn't want to rock the boat.

106
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:53,000
However, we had a quick conversation before that Senate hearing, Representative Edwards and myself and some of the stakeholders that had brought this issue forth and I think from representative, I don't want to speak for Representative Edwards, but from what Representative Edwards said, as long as the cost sharing emulated what was in commercial plans or employer dental plans, that he was fine with it.

107
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,500
And so we did some quick research.

108
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:08,000
I spoke to people at Delta Dental, and they informed me that 99% of commercial plans precluded cost-sharing for diagnostic and preventative care.

109
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:19,500
So for me, the issue was that we didn't want to create obstacles to people at least getting the diagnosis and preventative care.

110
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:24,000
And of course, there's reasons to have core sharing.

111
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,500
I understand those reasons and the principles behind that.

112
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:33,500
The concern, of course, is that it will decrease utilization.

113
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:49,000
So I think this was a very, very good compromise in that people would still be able to get diagnosis and preventative care without having to worry about the cost sharing.

114
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,500
So I wanted you to know that that's how that came to be.

115
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:31,000
We weren't trying to slip a fast one on you by bringing it back in a different form and I hope that this will be agreeable to this work group and to the Finance Committee thank you any questions for Representative Shapiro thank you and I'll let other people speak to the other changes thank you I failed to remember your name I'm really bad that way, but please come forward.

116
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Spell it out.

117
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Brooke Belanger, B-E-L-a-n-g-e-r thank you thank you um so i can speak to the risk corridor uh that is in the language before you today the risk corridor is make sure the microphone is close enough to you that you...

118
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Oh, I apologize.

119
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:03,500
The department added a risk corridor language to the state fiscal year 2020 managed care organization contracts.

120
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:16,500
And what this mechanism does is it protected the states against the managed care organizations experiencing a windfall as a result of decreased utilization in COVID.

121
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:34,000
So it was put in to really make sure that the state's interests were protected and that the MCOs weren't receiving unjust compensation as a result of the decline we saw in individuals receiving care.

122
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:43,500
So I'm happy to flesh that out more if needed, but I think that may serve your purpose today.

123
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:48,000
So now I understand what the risk corridor is.

124
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
That's great.

125
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:58,000
So why are we paying CMS back $2.4 million as it relates to that risk corridor?

126
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Thank you.

127
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:07,000
So the $2.4 million is needed to complete our settlement with the federal government.

128
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,500
When Centene reported inflated pharmacy costs, that adjusted the risk corridor.

129
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:37,500
And so the $2.4 million will be returned to the federal government to complete that corridor, which, and as you know, the inflated cost calculations that Centene reported was what allowed the state of New Hampshire to participate in the broader Centene settlement agreement, which leads to the $21 million.

130
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:48,000
So the smaller portion, that 22.1 million, is to return to the federal government as a result of the inflated costs.

131
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,500
Any other questions from the committee or anybody else?

132
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,500
No?

133
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,500
Okay.

134
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:00,500
Is there anybody else that wants to speak?

135
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,500
Dr.

136
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:06,000
Finney, do you have any final words?

137
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Thank you.

138
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,500
Those are my final words.

139
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:17,000
Now, I truly appreciate all of the work that has gone into this.

140
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,500
Countless hours, countless years, actually.

141
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:25,000
And so I just want to do a blanket thank you.

142
00:13:25,000 --> 00:14:00,500
And, you know, the department will certainly do whatever we can to make sure that we keep moving forward that's the most important thing is there anybody else in the audience that wanted to put in their two cents no all righty thank you all very much and uh we'll close the hearing i guess i should have added that we're going to miss it at a remote in the future.

143
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,500
You got that.

144
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,500
Very efficient.

145
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,500
All right.

146
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,500
Thank you.

147
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,500
Thank you.

148
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,500
Thank you.

149
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,500
Thank you.
