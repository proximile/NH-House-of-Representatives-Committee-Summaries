we expect you guys to do your own muting
 
00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
so we don't if if you're going you're

your own muting
 
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:32.880 align:start position:0%

something something like that session I
 
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
always say every session is different
 
00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:56.120 align:start position:0%
and this one is different right out of
 
00:09:57.870 --> 00:09:57.880 align:start position:0%
the block so we don't have to go far to
 
00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:00.040 align:start position:0%
get make make this one different
 
00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:01.880 align:start position:0%

business um I am currently uh I live in

has really been a fascinating uh
 
00:31:03.149 --> 00:31:03.159 align:start position:0%
committee to be on because we covered so
 
00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:06.760 align:start position:0%
many different things and we might know
 
00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
a good deal about one but there are so
 
00:31:12.149 --> 00:31:12.159 align:start position:0%
many other areas that maybe we've had no
 
00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:17.200 align:start position:0%
contact with um so it's really it's
 
00:31:20.110 --> 00:31:20.120 align:start position:0%
really interesting um uh one of the
 
00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
things I hope that maybe we can oh I
 
00:31:24.629 --> 00:31:24.639 align:start position:0%
also wanted to say that this is a
 
00:31:27.909 --> 00:31:27.919 align:start position:0%
terrifically has been over the four ter
 
00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:30.320 align:start position:0%
the three terms and now this one uh an
 
00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:33.200 align:start position:0%
extremely affable group even though many
 
00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
members have changed and even though we
 
00:31:39.549 --> 00:31:39.559 align:start position:0%
often disagree on things we very often
 
00:31:39.559 --> 00:31:40.470 align:start position:0%
often disagree on things we very often
find

00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:40.480 align:start position:0%
find
 
00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:44.440 align:start position:0%
consensus um or we're able to tweak
 
00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:47.200 align:start position:0%
bills so that we can find
 
00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:51.200 align:start position:0%
consensus um and people always get along
 
00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
um so I hope that that that will
 
00:31:58.549 --> 00:31:58.559 align:start position:0%
continue but I also hope that uh if it's
 
00:32:01.389 --> 00:32:01.399 align:start position:0%
possible we may be able to identify the
 
00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
bills where there is pretty much
 
00:32:08.029 --> 00:32:08.039 align:start position:0%
agreement and sort of put them in one
 
00:32:08.039 --> 00:32:09.629 align:start position:0%
agreement and sort of put them in one
category

00:32:09.629 --> 00:32:09.639 align:start position:0%
category
 
00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:13.960 align:start position:0%
and find ways of of of of of coming to
 
00:32:17.269 --> 00:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
to consensus and have others that where
 
00:32:20.029 --> 00:32:20.039 align:start position:0%
we need to work harder we can kind of
 
00:32:22.909 --> 00:32:22.919 align:start position:0%
spend more time on that but uh really
 
00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:26.120 align:start position:0%

country become a uh communist
 
00:35:55.589 --> 00:35:55.599 align:start position:0%
hellhole recently and I hope that
 
00:35:57.910 --> 00:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen to us in the states and
 
00:36:00.430 --> 00:36:00.440 align:start position:0%
especially not here in New Hampshire so
 
00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
uh that's a little bit about me okay
 
00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
thank you all right and um and I guess
 
00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:09.160 align:start position:0%
just to round it out Pam do you want to
 
00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
kind of introduce yourself to I don't
 
00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
know does everybody know who you are yet
 
00:36:15.550 --> 00:36:15.560 align:start position:0%
I mean it's a Well everybody's gotten
 
00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
emails from me or or phone calls so I I
 
00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
um I hope you know I knew who I was I
 
00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I introduced myself well in
 
00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
in my emails but my name is Pam Sparling
 
00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:31.480 align:start position:0%
um I have been working with the Commerce
 
00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
Committee since I started at the
 
00:36:37.109 --> 00:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
legislature um 31 years
 
00:36:41.550 --> 00:36:41.560 align:start position:0%
ago uh and so it's I my other committees
 
00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:43.640 align:start position:0%
all the researchers you'll discover um
 
00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
have four or or generally four
 
00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
committees so I'm not always present in
 
00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
the room but with zoom it might be a
 
00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
different story I might be able to be
 
00:36:57.589 --> 00:36:57.599 align:start position:0%
multiple Place places at once more
 
00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
easily so my my other committees are are
 
00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
Edna election law and legislative
 
00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
Administration um and I've I've always
 
00:37:11.069 --> 00:37:11.079 align:start position:0%
of course loved Commerce and um and as
 
00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
provide nonpartisan research primarily
 
00:37:16.270 --> 00:37:16.280 align:start position:0%
at the direction of the chairman and
 
00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:18.280 align:start position:0%
work with the with any subcommittees as
 
00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
well so that's enough about me I guess
 
00:37:25.390 --> 00:37:25.400 align:start position:0%
the emphasis there is that if if there's
 
00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
something you would like to have Pam
 
00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
work on you do need to go through me to
 
00:37:35.109 --> 00:37:35.119 align:start position:0%
get permission to do that so um over oh
 
00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
right on schedule um so briefly for
 
00:37:40.270 --> 00:37:40.280 align:start position:0%
those who who've been on the committee
 
00:37:43.870 --> 00:37:43.880 align:start position:0%
um know that historically uh Commerce we
 
00:37:46.270 --> 00:37:46.280 align:start position:0%
would uh break up into three
 
00:37:49.069 --> 00:37:49.079 align:start position:0%
divisions um we had uh Banking and
 
00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:52.480 align:start position:0%
business uh we have uh insurance and
 
00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
then we have liquor um and and
 
00:37:58.390 --> 00:37:58.400 align:start position:0%
Hospitality type of legislation
 
00:38:03.109 --> 00:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
um it it it is my intent um given that
 
00:38:06.069 --> 00:38:06.079 align:start position:0%
we're what we're doing here with this co
 
00:38:09.109 --> 00:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
uh being all uh virtual that um I I'm
 
00:38:11.349 --> 00:38:11.359 align:start position:0%
going to try to we subcommittee is
 
00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
really to a minimum at all and that
 
00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:17.640 align:start position:0%
we're going to uh instead if a bill
 
00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
needs to be really worked on and and we
 
00:38:22.309 --> 00:38:22.319 align:start position:0%
can get somewhere um my feeling is that
 
00:38:25.309 --> 00:38:25.319 align:start position:0%
we should just retain it and that and
 
00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:28.160 align:start position:0%
that way when we retain bills that means
 
00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:30.520 align:start position:0%
we'll come back in in in September
 
00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:33.200 align:start position:0%
October is when uh we would then be able
 
00:38:35.829 --> 00:38:35.839 align:start position:0%
to do our normal study committee sub
 
00:38:38.589 --> 00:38:38.599 align:start position:0%
subcomittee type work and God I hope
 
00:38:40.870 --> 00:38:40.880 align:start position:0%
this thing is we'll have our vaccines
 
00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
and we got our her immunity by then and
 
00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:45.720 align:start position:0%
so that we all can meet face to face
 
00:38:47.069 --> 00:38:47.079 align:start position:0%
because I I just can't imagine a
 
00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
subcommittee virtually you know we you
 
00:38:51.710 --> 00:38:51.720 align:start position:0%
our subcommittees are very active we
 
00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
allow everybody to participate and and
 
00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes the room can be packed full of
 
00:38:58.150 --> 00:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
people so uh trying to do that virtually
 
00:39:00.750 --> 00:39:00.760 align:start position:0%
is going to be a nightmare um otherwise
 
00:39:04.270 --> 00:39:04.280 align:start position:0%
um any bills that we pretty well can see
 
00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:05.560 align:start position:0%
you know which way they're going whether
 
00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:07.880 align:start position:0%
we want to pass it or or or kill it
 
00:39:09.270 --> 00:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
we'll you know we'll move for in
 
00:39:12.109 --> 00:39:12.119 align:start position:0%
expedient and get those bills out um but
 
00:39:15.309 --> 00:39:15.319 align:start position:0%
so don't be surprised if if uh we have
 
00:39:18.309 --> 00:39:18.319 align:start position:0%
the largest retained list than we've
 
00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
ever had before but we've had some big
 
00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
lists in the past so um Commerce is a
 
00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:24.640 align:start position:0%
committee is we has a history we really
 
00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
work our bills hard um we don't we don't
 
00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:29.160 align:start position:0%
we don't want to hear people think the
 
00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
bill needs to be recommitted back to
 
00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:32.480 align:start position:0%
committee we certainly don't want to see
 
00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:35.640 align:start position:0%
the Senate mucking up our handiwork and
 
00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:37.800 align:start position:0%
on the other side of the coin uh we have
 
00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
done um many Senate bills we have done
 
00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
the hard work that they maybe um weren't
 
00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
weren't didn't have the time to do then
 
00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:48.520 align:start position:0%
they send it to us to fix it and that's
 
00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
and that's what we do you know we we fix
 
00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
bills and we do good job and that's the
 
00:39:54.349 --> 00:39:54.359 align:start position:0%
reason why we get more bills than any
 
00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
other committee and why we have such a
 
00:39:58.750 --> 00:39:58.760 align:start position:0%
wide range um is uh going way back to
 
00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:01.560 align:start position:0%
Donna sitech um she you know recognize
 
00:40:03.109 --> 00:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
that this committee does really great
 
00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:06.680 align:start position:0%
work so we will keep uh pursuing that
 
00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:09.800 align:start position:0%
direction all right so now being 10:47
 
00:40:12.069 --> 00:40:12.079 align:start position:0%

00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:13.560 align:start position:0%

00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
members of the staff uh though there are
 
00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
eight or nine folks on the call I'll
 
00:42:57.349 --> 00:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
just be introducing uh three others to
 
00:43:00.630 --> 00:43:00.640 align:start position:0%
briefly introduce themselves um on the
 
00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
screen there you'll see our mission and
 
00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
I think the core part uh is to pre
 
00:43:06.870 --> 00:43:06.880 align:start position:0%
public good by ensuring the existence of
 
00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
a safe and competitive Insurance
 
00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:10.760 align:start position:0%
Marketplace uh and we're committed to
 
00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
doing that in an honest effective and
 
00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:14.720 align:start position:0%
timely manner uh that kind of is our
 
00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
overriding uh Mission and our goal when
 
00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:20.240 align:start position:0%
working with uh uh any of our
 
00:43:22.589 --> 00:43:22.599 align:start position:0%
constituencies um for those of those of
 
00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
you who don't know me my name is Chris
 
00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
nicolopoulos and I've been a
 
00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:27.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner here at the department of
 
00:43:31.309 --> 00:43:31.319 align:start position:0%
insurance for 10 months um 10 days after
 
00:43:34.510 --> 00:43:34.520 align:start position:0%
um I started we went into remote uh
 
00:43:36.270 --> 00:43:36.280 align:start position:0%
covid world and so it's been an
 
00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
interesting almost year at this point uh
 
00:43:43.109 --> 00:43:43.119 align:start position:0%
but as I uh think back uh to my time
 
00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
working with the Commerce Committee I
 
00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
think this will be my 18th legislative
 
00:43:49.150 --> 00:43:49.160 align:start position:0%
session working in some role uh with the
 
00:43:51.790 --> 00:43:51.800 align:start position:0%
committee uh prior to uh accepting the
 
00:43:54.270 --> 00:43:54.280 align:start position:0%
position as uh Commissioner of Insurance
 
00:43:56.109 --> 00:43:56.119 align:start position:0%
I spent uh five years working with the
 
00:43:57.390 --> 00:43:57.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire independent Insurance
 
00:43:57.400 --> 00:43:58.630 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire independent Insurance
Agents

00:43:58.630 --> 00:43:58.640 align:start position:0%
Agents
 
00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
Association um commissioner if I can
 
00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
interrupt for a sec I'm not controlling
 
00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
the slides I think Pam still has that
 
00:44:06.990 --> 00:44:07.000 align:start position:0%
and I think we want to advance to the
 
00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
next one Pam do you want to give me the
 
00:44:11.230 --> 00:44:11.240 align:start position:0%
chance to do that or do you want to
 
00:44:12.309 --> 00:44:12.319 align:start position:0%
continue because I keep getting a
 
00:44:13.990 --> 00:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
message I can't share my screen while
 
00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
another participant is
 
00:44:17.829 --> 00:44:17.839 align:start position:0%
sharing okay fine I'm I'm gonna stop
 
00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
sharing and then you'll be able to
 
00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:23.880 align:start position:0%
share so prior to my time uh with the
 
00:44:26.109 --> 00:44:26.119 align:start position:0%
Independent Insurance Agents I spent uh
 
00:44:28.470 --> 00:44:28.480 align:start position:0%
six years with the law firm of pretty
 
00:44:31.470 --> 00:44:31.480 align:start position:0%
flarity and in that role I represented
 
00:44:34.030 --> 00:44:34.040 align:start position:0%
Insurance uh consumers and a few
 
00:44:35.950 --> 00:44:35.960 align:start position:0%
insurance companies at the
 
00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:38.440 align:start position:0%
legislature uh and prior to that I spent
 
00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
five years working with New Hampshire
 
00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
Realtors so in all of those roles I have
 
00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
been uh intimately involved in uh a
 
00:44:47.109 --> 00:44:47.119 align:start position:0%
number of the bills that the Commerce
 
00:44:50.230 --> 00:44:50.240 align:start position:0%
Committee um has worked on and it's
 
00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:52.200 align:start position:0%
surprising to see this year how many new
 
00:44:53.710 --> 00:44:53.720 align:start position:0%
faces there are I look forward to
 
00:44:55.950 --> 00:44:55.960 align:start position:0%
building a relationship uh with all of
 
00:44:59.109 --> 00:44:59.119 align:start position:0%
you uh um the Department of Insurance
 
00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
currently has 76 staff members um there
 
00:45:06.750 --> 00:45:06.760 align:start position:0%
are 85 authorized positions but we we
 
00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:10.240 align:start position:0%
typically have uh 10 to 15 uh open
 
00:45:13.309 --> 00:45:13.319 align:start position:0%
positions uh and that's what we have now
 
00:45:15.710 --> 00:45:15.720 align:start position:0%
later on today I will introduce DJ beton
 
00:45:18.589 --> 00:45:18.599 align:start position:0%

00:45:21.829 --> 00:45:21.839 align:start position:0%
new Deputy uh commissioner uh he was uh
 
00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
gracious enough to join us a couple of
 
00:45:25.790 --> 00:45:25.800 align:start position:0%
days early so he could uh meet all of
 
00:45:28.109 --> 00:45:28.119 align:start position:0%

00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
role his previous role as policy uh
 
00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:33.440 align:start position:0%

00:45:36.190 --> 00:45:36.200 align:start position:0%

00:45:39.549 --> 00:45:39.559 align:start position:0%

00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
have Emily dhy who's our PNC legal
 
00:46:43.630 --> 00:46:43.640 align:start position:0%
counsel the Hampshire has a lot of
 
00:46:46.109 --> 00:46:46.119 align:start position:0%
distinctions but in the insurance World
 
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
it has the distinction of being the
 
00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:49.400 align:start position:0%
first Insurance regulatory insurance
 
00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
department established by state and that
 
00:46:57.150 --> 00:46:57.160 align:start position:0%
was uh 170 years ago uh in 1851
 
00:46:58.829 --> 00:46:58.839 align:start position:0%
uh primarily when you're dealing with
 
00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
insurance laws uh those laws will be uh
 
00:47:04.190 --> 00:47:04.200 align:start position:0%
between RSA 400 and
 
00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:06.400 align:start position:0%
420n those are the regulations that our
 
00:47:11.710 --> 00:47:11.720 align:start position:0%
department um is is uh responsible
 
00:47:14.349 --> 00:47:14.359 align:start position:0%
for um and I think it's important to
 
00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
note at this point that um Insurance
 
00:47:20.750 --> 00:47:20.760 align:start position:0%
primarily is regulated at a state basis
 
00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
um and uh for PNC especially uh
 
00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
virtually all regulation happens here at
 
00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
the state um and so that means this
 
00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
legislature needs to give us Authority
 
00:47:35.230 --> 00:47:35.240 align:start position:0%
on how to uh enforce and regulate
 
00:47:38.109 --> 00:47:38.119 align:start position:0%
Insurance um and very much the same in
 
00:47:39.950 --> 00:47:39.960 align:start position:0%
life and health it's regulated at the
 
00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
state level uh though uh with the
 
00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
Affordable Care Act and some
 
00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:46.040 align:start position:0%
requirements that come down from the
 
00:47:50.349 --> 00:47:50.359 align:start position:0%
federal government um the some of the
 
00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
provisions are uh enumerated there at
 
00:47:54.109 --> 00:47:54.119 align:start position:0%
the federal government but the
 
00:47:56.309 --> 00:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
enforcement of virtually all of those
 
00:48:02.069 --> 00:48:02.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:07.160 align:start position:0%
level as a department uh we collect um
 
00:48:11.069 --> 00:48:11.079 align:start position:0%
roughly 130 to $140 million a year in
 
00:48:13.150 --> 00:48:13.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire general fund Revenue the
 
00:48:16.230 --> 00:48:16.240 align:start position:0%
vast vast majority of that is uh premium
 
00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
tax uh premium taxes collected in
 
00:48:22.270 --> 00:48:22.280 align:start position:0%
advance every March uh and that's
 
00:48:25.950 --> 00:48:25.960 align:start position:0%
roughly 120 million of the 134 million
 
00:48:27.589 --> 00:48:27.599 align:start position:0%
uh additionally we collect licensing
 
00:48:29.589 --> 00:48:29.599 align:start position:0%
fees from a number of folks uh in
 
00:48:29.599 --> 00:48:31.230 align:start position:0%
fees from a number of folks uh in
administrative

00:48:31.230 --> 00:48:31.240 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
00:48:34.510 --> 00:48:34.520 align:start position:0%
fines the department itself is not
 
00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
generally funded uh our entire
 
00:48:38.710 --> 00:48:38.720 align:start position:0%
department is run on an assessment
 
00:48:40.990 --> 00:48:41.000 align:start position:0%
that's charged to any insurance company
 
00:48:42.430 --> 00:48:42.440 align:start position:0%
that sells Insurance here in New
 
00:48:45.390 --> 00:48:45.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and oversimplifying it uh we
 
00:48:47.349 --> 00:48:47.359 align:start position:0%
look at the total number
 
00:48:51.150 --> 00:48:51.160 align:start position:0%
of uh premium dollars sold to New
 
00:48:53.470 --> 00:48:53.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Insurance consumers and a
 
00:48:55.750 --> 00:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
fraction of a fraction of a percentage
 
00:48:59.270 --> 00:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
is assessed to uh run the department um
 
00:49:00.750 --> 00:49:00.760 align:start position:0%
which is an appropriate way to fund a
 
00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
department that's regulating an industry
 
00:49:05.950 --> 00:49:05.960 align:start position:0%
um we run we run pretty efficiently as
 
00:49:08.870 --> 00:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
compared to other states um and we do so
 
00:49:11.630 --> 00:49:11.640 align:start position:0%
all without any impact on general fund
 
00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:14.109 align:start position:0%
all without any impact on general fund
uh

00:49:14.109 --> 00:49:14.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:16.349 --> 00:49:16.359 align:start position:0%
expenses when you think of our
 
00:49:19.109 --> 00:49:19.119 align:start position:0%
department as a um as a regulatory of
 
00:49:22.549 --> 00:49:22.559 align:start position:0%
all licenses uh it's staggering how many
 
00:49:24.990 --> 00:49:25.000 align:start position:0%
folks are are actually licensed here in
 
00:49:27.470 --> 00:49:27.480 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire uh for for Insurance
 
00:49:31.789 --> 00:49:31.799 align:start position:0%
Producers that uh folks that sell um PNC
 
00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:34.040 align:start position:0%
or life and health insurance we have
 
00:49:36.910 --> 00:49:36.920 align:start position:0%
6,500 uh resident licenses which seems
 
00:49:39.470 --> 00:49:39.480 align:start position:0%
like a lot but there are some
 
00:49:43.309 --> 00:49:43.319 align:start position:0%
91,000 out ofate producers licensed to
 
00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
sell insurance to a residents here in
 
00:49:48.109 --> 00:49:48.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and for any producer if
 
00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
they want to sell any business to a New
 
00:49:52.390 --> 00:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire a consumer or a Hampshire
 
00:49:54.349 --> 00:49:54.359 align:start position:0%
business they must obtain a producers
 
00:49:57.309 --> 00:49:57.319 align:start position:0%
license here in New Hampshire uh
 
00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
similarly there's a nearly 800 adjusters
 
00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
adjusters generally work for insurance
 
00:50:06.750 --> 00:50:06.760 align:start position:0%
companies uh to uh resolve and and
 
00:50:09.470 --> 00:50:09.480 align:start position:0%
settle claims we have 800 resident
 
00:50:13.190 --> 00:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
licenses and um 75 almost 76,000
 
00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:14.870 align:start position:0%
licenses and um 75 almost 76,000
non-resident

00:50:14.870 --> 00:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
non-resident
 
00:50:19.789 --> 00:50:19.799 align:start position:0%
lienes um those licenses um are employed
 
00:50:23.630 --> 00:50:23.640 align:start position:0%
by some 600 resident businesses or 7,000
 
00:50:26.870 --> 00:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
uh non-resident um foreign uh businesses
 
00:50:29.950 --> 00:50:29.960 align:start position:0%
is uh each of those uh each of those
 
00:50:33.870 --> 00:50:33.880 align:start position:0%
licenses require staff here to review um
 
00:50:36.990 --> 00:50:37.000 align:start position:0%
accept payment for and approve
 
00:50:39.190 --> 00:50:39.200 align:start position:0%
um additionally we have a division of
 
00:50:42.589 --> 00:50:42.599 align:start position:0%
our department that uh reviews approves
 
00:50:46.270 --> 00:50:46.280 align:start position:0%
or denies each and every policy form uh
 
00:50:47.710 --> 00:50:47.720 align:start position:0%
that an insurance company might want to
 
00:50:50.309 --> 00:50:50.319 align:start position:0%
use here in New Hampshire and so it
 
00:50:52.870 --> 00:50:52.880 align:start position:0%
might be the uh the different forms that
 
00:50:54.230 --> 00:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
are mailed to you each year when you get
 
00:50:56.990 --> 00:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
your home or Auto policies it may be the
 
00:51:00.030 --> 00:51:00.040 align:start position:0%
underlying rating uh structure how they
 
00:51:03.710 --> 00:51:03.720 align:start position:0%
establish U uh their policy rating we're
 
00:51:05.309 --> 00:51:05.319 align:start position:0%
we're reviewing and approving those to
 
00:51:06.750 --> 00:51:06.760 align:start position:0%
make sure they're not
 
00:51:09.349 --> 00:51:09.359 align:start position:0%
discriminatory um that they're
 
00:51:13.309 --> 00:51:13.319 align:start position:0%
uh consumer appropriate um and in
 
00:51:16.349 --> 00:51:16.359 align:start position:0%
compliance with our laws um so those are
 
00:51:18.270 --> 00:51:18.280 align:start position:0%
you know hundreds of thousands or
 
00:51:19.950 --> 00:51:19.960 align:start position:0%
millions of pages of documents that we
 
00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
need to to review we also have divisions
 
00:51:24.789 --> 00:51:24.799 align:start position:0%
here at the department that look at
 
00:51:27.069 --> 00:51:27.079 align:start position:0%
Financial examination and Analysis
 
00:51:29.069 --> 00:51:29.079 align:start position:0%
for any insurance company that's doing
 
00:51:31.470 --> 00:51:31.480 align:start position:0%
business with a New Hampshire consumer
 
00:51:33.390 --> 00:51:33.400 align:start position:0%
we're looking at their uh their
 
00:51:35.829 --> 00:51:35.839 align:start position:0%
financial statements to make sure one
 
00:51:38.510 --> 00:51:38.520 align:start position:0%
that they're appropriately uh filed but
 
00:51:40.910 --> 00:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
also that they have sufficient um
 
00:51:44.190 --> 00:51:44.200 align:start position:0%
Financial wherewithal to pay claims that
 
00:51:47.109 --> 00:51:47.119 align:start position:0%
um that consumers can have confidence
 
00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
that their uh Financial solvency will
 
00:51:54.190 --> 00:51:54.200 align:start position:0%
not impact um their underlying insurance
 
00:51:57.030 --> 00:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
contract um we have a division here that
 
00:51:59.549 --> 00:51:59.559 align:start position:0%
does Market conduct analysis and exam
 
00:52:01.589 --> 00:52:01.599 align:start position:0%
and what that's doing is uh these are
 
00:52:03.349 --> 00:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
investigators that go into companies to
 
00:52:06.950 --> 00:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
make sure uh one uh proactively we go in
 
00:52:09.150 --> 00:52:09.160 align:start position:0%
to just make sure that they're working
 
00:52:10.710 --> 00:52:10.720 align:start position:0%
in compliance with our laws that they're
 
00:52:13.270 --> 00:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
rating policies fairly that they're
 
00:52:16.309 --> 00:52:16.319 align:start position:0%
fairly uh paying claims uh and that
 
00:52:17.829 --> 00:52:17.839 align:start position:0%
they're doing so in compliance with
 
00:52:20.670 --> 00:52:20.680 align:start position:0%
their underlying forms uh and those
 
00:52:22.470 --> 00:52:22.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes we do that proactively uh just
 
00:52:25.109 --> 00:52:25.119 align:start position:0%
as a test uh if we have consumer
 
00:52:26.950 --> 00:52:26.960 align:start position:0%
complaints or concerns and and there's a
 
00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:29.400 align:start position:0%
reason for us to do a targeted Market
 
00:52:31.109 --> 00:52:31.119 align:start position:0%
conduct exam we have the ability to do
 
00:52:32.109 --> 00:52:32.119 align:start position:0%
that as
 
00:52:34.789 --> 00:52:34.799 align:start position:0%
well we have a a couple folks here at
 
00:52:37.309 --> 00:52:37.319 align:start position:0%
the department who uh handle insurance
 
00:52:40.109 --> 00:52:40.119 align:start position:0%
fraud uh referrals and and each year we
 
00:52:43.710 --> 00:52:43.720 align:start position:0%
get about 240 insurance fraud referrals
 
00:52:46.589 --> 00:52:46.599 align:start position:0%
generally from companies who see really
 
00:52:49.589 --> 00:52:49.599 align:start position:0%
uh suspicious claims but sometimes those
 
00:52:51.109 --> 00:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
come from friends and families and
 
00:52:53.670 --> 00:52:53.680 align:start position:0%
neighbors who are aware that somebody uh
 
00:52:56.670 --> 00:52:56.680 align:start position:0%
may be committing insurance fraud and
 
00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
our investigators will uh will look at
 
00:53:03.470 --> 00:53:03.480 align:start position:0%
uh those referrals and if uh if
 
00:53:06.910 --> 00:53:06.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate we'll investigate have um
 
00:53:11.470 --> 00:53:11.480 align:start position:0%
have interviews with folks um we don't
 
00:53:14.109 --> 00:53:14.119 align:start position:0%
um we don't prosecute uh insurance fraud
 
00:53:15.870 --> 00:53:15.880 align:start position:0%
and so what will happen in those cases
 
00:53:17.990 --> 00:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
is if if there appears to be insurance
 
00:53:20.670 --> 00:53:20.680 align:start position:0%
fraud we prepare the case turn it over
 
00:53:24.710 --> 00:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
to a county attorney uh who then um will
 
00:53:26.990 --> 00:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
prosecute violations of the law
 
00:53:29.549 --> 00:53:29.559 align:start position:0%
uh last year and typically last year we
 
00:53:32.710 --> 00:53:32.720 align:start position:0%
referred 24 cases for prosecution and
 
00:53:36.270 --> 00:53:36.280 align:start position:0%
that's in line with uh a typical
 
00:53:40.470 --> 00:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
year um we hold for all those lenses the
 
00:53:43.309 --> 00:53:43.319 align:start position:0%
the near 200,000 lenses that are
 
00:53:47.309 --> 00:53:47.319 align:start position:0%
licensed here in New Hampshire um if uh
 
00:53:48.589 --> 00:53:48.599 align:start position:0%
if we're aware that somebody has
 
00:53:50.990 --> 00:53:51.000 align:start position:0%
violated a a rule requirement we have
 
00:53:54.470 --> 00:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
folks here who can um investigate uh
 
00:53:57.430 --> 00:53:57.440 align:start position:0%
violations of the of their license
 
00:53:59.270 --> 00:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
um and ultimately we can hold hearings
 
00:54:01.670 --> 00:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
here to determine what the appropriate
 
00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:04.960 align:start position:0%
um punishment if if there is a
 
00:54:07.309 --> 00:54:07.319 align:start position:0%
violation um and then finally we hold
 
00:54:08.950 --> 00:54:08.960 align:start position:0%
public hearings on things like workers
 
00:54:12.430 --> 00:54:12.440 align:start position:0%
comp premium rates uh cost drivers uh
 
00:54:13.829 --> 00:54:13.839 align:start position:0%
for health
 
00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
insurance um I think most importantly uh
 
00:54:20.069 --> 00:54:20.079 align:start position:0%
what we do here in in uh the department
 
00:54:21.910 --> 00:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
or at the department is protect
 
00:54:24.309 --> 00:54:24.319 align:start position:0%
consumers uh in any given year our
 
00:54:30.069 --> 00:54:30.079 align:start position:0%
consumer team uh will um have almost
 
00:54:32.789 --> 00:54:32.799 align:start position:0%
5,000 consumer inquiries and that could
 
00:54:35.470 --> 00:54:35.480 align:start position:0%
be anything as simple as I don't
 
00:54:37.990 --> 00:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
understand what actual cash value is on
 
00:54:42.470 --> 00:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
my policy um or uh questions about how
 
00:54:46.829 --> 00:54:46.839 align:start position:0%
claims work uh to uh to actual uh
 
00:54:48.349 --> 00:54:48.359 align:start position:0%
consumer complaints that are filed with
 
00:54:51.750 --> 00:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
the department so of the 5,000 inquiries
 
00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
we get a year uh that go to our consumer
 
00:54:58.349 --> 00:54:58.359 align:start position:0%
team uh about 700 or 800 are turned into
 
00:55:00.710 --> 00:55:00.720 align:start position:0%
complaints and those are uh people who
 
00:55:02.510 --> 00:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
are unhappy with some part of an
 
00:55:04.870 --> 00:55:04.880 align:start position:0%
insurance transaction who want our
 
00:55:07.630 --> 00:55:07.640 align:start position:0%
experts to work with uh the companies or
 
00:55:07.640 --> 00:55:08.309 align:start position:0%
experts to work with uh the companies or
the

00:55:08.309 --> 00:55:08.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:55:11.309 --> 00:55:11.319 align:start position:0%
adjusters um to determine uh whether or
 
00:55:13.430 --> 00:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
not they've been treated fairly or
 
00:55:16.069 --> 00:55:16.079 align:start position:0%
appropriately and though most of those
 
00:55:18.750 --> 00:55:18.760 align:start position:0%
uh most of those interactions are uh
 
00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
education of the educational variety um
 
00:55:26.309 --> 00:55:26.319 align:start position:0%
last year we we documented um over a
 
00:55:28.750 --> 00:55:28.760 align:start position:0%
million dollars in uh consumer harm that
 
00:55:32.270 --> 00:55:32.280 align:start position:0%
we were able to that we're able to uh to
 
00:55:35.549 --> 00:55:35.559 align:start position:0%
correct and uh and in a year that number
 
00:55:37.589 --> 00:55:37.599 align:start position:0%
could jump you know if there's a life
 
00:55:39.390 --> 00:55:39.400 align:start position:0%
insurance policy it could easily be
 
00:55:40.910 --> 00:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of dollars that we
 
00:55:43.230 --> 00:55:43.240 align:start position:0%
help someone collect but but most of
 
00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
those are small um disputes regarding uh
 
00:55:50.549 --> 00:55:50.559 align:start position:0%
an explanation of benefits from a health
 
00:55:53.230 --> 00:55:53.240 align:start position:0%
insurance company to um how to
 
00:55:56.349 --> 00:55:56.359 align:start position:0%
appropriately value a total loss on a a
 
00:55:56.359 --> 00:55:57.069 align:start position:0%
appropriately value a total loss on a a
an

00:55:57.069 --> 00:55:57.079 align:start position:0%
an
 
00:55:59.430 --> 00:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
automobile um I think those that's a
 
00:56:01.470 --> 00:56:01.480 align:start position:0%
place where we can be particularly
 
00:56:03.230 --> 00:56:03.240 align:start position:0%
effective to Consumers who don't know
 
00:56:06.109 --> 00:56:06.119 align:start position:0%
where else to turn uh it's an Avenue
 
00:56:08.910 --> 00:56:08.920 align:start position:0%
that's available to Consumers uh short
 
00:56:11.150 --> 00:56:11.160 align:start position:0%
of having to hire a lawyer to uh protect
 
00:56:14.430 --> 00:56:14.440 align:start position:0%
their interests um and our team we have
 
00:56:18.109 --> 00:56:18.119 align:start position:0%
seven members who are on that team um do
 
00:56:21.430 --> 00:56:21.440 align:start position:0%
those jobs because they love of helping
 
00:56:23.510 --> 00:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh helping
 
00:56:27.789 --> 00:56:27.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:30.230 --> 00:56:30.240 align:start position:0%
you're as uh Commerce Committee members
 
00:56:32.589 --> 00:56:32.599 align:start position:0%
you are bound to hear in the next two
 
00:56:35.710 --> 00:56:35.720 align:start position:0%
years of the NAIC or the National
 
00:56:37.589 --> 00:56:37.599 align:start position:0%
Association of insurance
 
00:56:40.150 --> 00:56:40.160 align:start position:0%
Commissioners uh I talked before about
 
00:56:42.829 --> 00:56:42.839 align:start position:0%
how uh almost all insurance is at the
 
00:56:42.839 --> 00:56:44.029 align:start position:0%
how uh almost all insurance is at the
state-based

00:56:44.029 --> 00:56:44.039 align:start position:0%
state-based
 
00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
level um and because of that it has
 
00:56:50.109 --> 00:56:50.119 align:start position:0%
become necessary for insurance
 
00:56:52.150 --> 00:56:52.160 align:start position:0%
Commissioners like myself to work
 
00:56:55.670 --> 00:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
together to ensure that uh we're
 
00:56:59.510 --> 00:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
benefiting from the kind of uh Universe
 
00:57:01.390 --> 00:57:01.400 align:start position:0%
of expertise Across the Nation and so
 
00:57:04.630 --> 00:57:04.640 align:start position:0%
NAIC serves in that role it is insists
 
00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:05.670 align:start position:0%
NAIC serves in that role it is insists
Insurance

00:57:05.670 --> 00:57:05.680 align:start position:0%
Insurance
 
00:57:09.430 --> 00:57:09.440 align:start position:0%
Regulators um in serving public interest
 
00:57:11.150 --> 00:57:11.160 align:start position:0%
and achieving a mission and how that
 
00:57:15.150 --> 00:57:15.160 align:start position:0%
generally comes out is that NAIC will uh
 
00:57:18.029 --> 00:57:18.039 align:start position:0%
work on model uh Insurance
 
00:57:21.069 --> 00:57:21.079 align:start position:0%
regulation uh that states can use to
 
00:57:24.910 --> 00:57:24.920 align:start position:0%
deal with um issues as they pop up and
 
00:57:28.349 --> 00:57:28.359 align:start position:0%
so oftentimes you will C uh an niic
 
00:57:30.950 --> 00:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
model that we're asking you to consider
 
00:57:33.710 --> 00:57:33.720 align:start position:0%
because uh it is a better mous strap for
 
00:57:36.470 --> 00:57:36.480 align:start position:0%
dealing with uh the ever evolving uh
 
00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:39.789 align:start position:0%
dealing with uh the ever evolving uh
insurance

00:57:39.789 --> 00:57:39.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:42.150 --> 00:57:42.160 align:start position:0%
issues and then finally I think it's
 
00:57:45.270 --> 00:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
important to understand how we view uh
 
00:57:48.029 --> 00:57:48.039 align:start position:0%
the department as a resource to your
 
00:57:51.990 --> 00:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
committee um as a department we will uh
 
00:57:53.309 --> 00:57:53.319 align:start position:0%
on occasion and this year I think we
 
00:57:55.630 --> 00:57:55.640 align:start position:0%
have five or six bills that we're asking
 
00:57:59.069 --> 00:57:59.079 align:start position:0%
to be sponsored and ped and when we do
 
00:58:01.109 --> 00:58:01.119 align:start position:0%
that it's because we perceive that
 
00:58:03.309 --> 00:58:03.319 align:start position:0%
something needs to be fixed in our laws
 
00:58:06.069 --> 00:58:06.079 align:start position:0%
that as insurance develops that we need
 
00:58:10.109 --> 00:58:10.119 align:start position:0%
to bring it to uh the current uh
 
00:58:11.789 --> 00:58:11.799 align:start position:0%
practice of insurance and so we will
 
00:58:14.990 --> 00:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
bring uh edits to our current laws
 
00:58:16.430 --> 00:58:16.440 align:start position:0%
because we think it's necessary to
 
00:58:19.710 --> 00:58:19.720 align:start position:0%
continue regulating the industry when we
 
00:58:23.190 --> 00:58:23.200 align:start position:0%
do that um we will work with all the
 
00:58:25.670 --> 00:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
constitu constituencies ahead of time in
 
00:58:27.950 --> 00:58:27.960 align:start position:0%
the summer we share drafts that we're
 
00:58:31.190 --> 00:58:31.200 align:start position:0%
working on with over 200 uh folks that
 
00:58:33.190 --> 00:58:33.200 align:start position:0%
are interested in uh Insurance
 
00:58:35.589 --> 00:58:35.599 align:start position:0%
regulation and we work with them so that
 
00:58:38.950 --> 00:58:38.960 align:start position:0%
we understand the pros and cons of those
 
00:58:42.470 --> 00:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
bills uh this year specifically uh we
 
00:58:45.549 --> 00:58:45.559 align:start position:0%
took uh we took uh extra concern to
 
00:58:48.069 --> 00:58:48.079 align:start position:0%
ensure that the bills that were asking
 
00:58:50.109 --> 00:58:50.119 align:start position:0%
to be passed were particularly
 
00:58:52.589 --> 00:58:52.599 align:start position:0%
non-controversial uh there were a couple
 
00:58:54.510 --> 00:58:54.520 align:start position:0%
of issues that we were looking at uh
 
00:58:56.430 --> 00:58:56.440 align:start position:0%
introducing that folks were concerned
 
00:58:58.589 --> 00:58:58.599 align:start position:0%
about and because of the co environment
 
00:59:01.430 --> 00:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
we're in we removed those as uh
 
00:59:03.870 --> 00:59:03.880 align:start position:0%
potential bills for this year because we
 
00:59:06.230 --> 00:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
weren't sure that there would be
 
00:59:08.670 --> 00:59:08.680 align:start position:0%
appropriate uh time to kind of flesh out
 
00:59:10.309 --> 00:59:10.319 align:start position:0%
all those concerns and so the bills that
 
00:59:13.069 --> 00:59:13.079 align:start position:0%
the department is asking for I hope you
 
00:59:14.829 --> 00:59:14.839 align:start position:0%
will find to be uh particularly
 
00:59:14.839 --> 00:59:16.150 align:start position:0%
will find to be uh particularly
non-controversial

00:59:16.150 --> 00:59:16.160 align:start position:0%
non-controversial
 
00:59:18.750 --> 00:59:18.760 align:start position:0%
uh and even though only a few of the
 
00:59:21.230 --> 00:59:21.240 align:start position:0%
bills that will participate in with this
 
00:59:24.390 --> 00:59:24.400 align:start position:0%
committee are ours you will see someone
 
00:59:26.109 --> 00:59:26.119 align:start position:0%
from the Department on virtually every
 
00:59:28.589 --> 00:59:28.599 align:start position:0%
every insurance bill sitting uh in the
 
00:59:30.910 --> 00:59:30.920 align:start position:0%
room or in a zoom meeting
 
00:59:34.589 --> 00:59:34.599 align:start position:0%
nowadays um because we are uh we are we
 
00:59:37.190 --> 00:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
should be resources to all of you to
 
00:59:38.990 --> 00:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
help understand the
 
00:59:41.029 --> 00:59:41.039 align:start position:0%
impact uh for those of you that don't
 
00:59:43.230 --> 00:59:43.240 align:start position:0%
know the department we almost always
 
00:59:45.309 --> 00:59:45.319 align:start position:0%
will start testifying on a bill by
 
00:59:46.710 --> 00:59:46.720 align:start position:0%
saying the department doesn't have a
 
00:59:49.750 --> 00:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
position and then we'll go on to talk at
 
00:59:51.789 --> 00:59:51.799 align:start position:0%
length about either all the wonderful
 
00:59:53.710 --> 00:59:53.720 align:start position:0%
things or all the issues that a
 
00:59:57.670 --> 00:59:57.680 align:start position:0%
particular bill um present presents um
 
01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:00.640 align:start position:0%
and we we are 100% aware that the policy
 
01:00:02.150 --> 01:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
decision is going to be made at your
 
01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
committee and in in the House and Senate
 
01:00:08.150 --> 01:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
um but as experts it's our role to tell
 
01:00:11.190 --> 01:00:11.200 align:start position:0%
you what uh what the hurdles are uh what
 
01:00:12.750 --> 01:00:12.760 align:start position:0%
the benefits and ultimately what the
 
01:00:14.990 --> 01:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
hurdles are of those bills and and we
 
01:00:18.270 --> 01:00:18.280 align:start position:0%
will take strides not to uh not to take
 
01:00:21.109 --> 01:00:21.119 align:start position:0%
a position but to fairly uh in an
 
01:00:24.349 --> 01:00:24.359 align:start position:0%
unbiased and non-political matter uh
 
01:00:27.470 --> 01:00:27.480 align:start position:0%
share those uh Resources with
 
01:00:31.230 --> 01:00:31.240 align:start position:0%

a analysis Department that works for me
 
01:02:04.630 --> 01:02:04.640 align:start position:0%
that analyzes all of these um mostly our
 
01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:06.720 align:start position:0%
62 domestics but we also look at the
 
01:02:11.549 --> 01:02:11.559 align:start position:0%
other companies too and that's that's a
 
01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:14.530 align:start position:0%
continual annual annual and quarterly
 
01:02:14.530 --> 01:02:15.589 align:start position:0%
continual annual annual and quarterly
[Music]

01:02:15.589 --> 01:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:02:21.029 --> 01:02:21.039 align:start position:0%
review we uh also uh license companies
 
01:02:22.150 --> 01:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
and other
 
01:02:25.950 --> 01:02:25.960 align:start position:0%
entities such as the tpas that uh
 
01:02:28.349 --> 01:02:28.359 align:start position:0%
commissioner nicolopoulos uh mentioned
 
01:02:31.510 --> 01:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
before and we also have oversight of
 
01:02:35.269 --> 01:02:35.279 align:start position:0%
Ensure rehabilitations and insolvencies
 
01:02:46.109 --> 01:02:46.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:57.150 --> 01:02:57.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:58.510 --> 01:02:58.520 align:start position:0%
okay sorry about that I didn't know I
 
01:03:00.630 --> 01:03:00.640 align:start position:0%
was supposed to do the unting part um
 
01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
can everybody hear me now we can hear
 
01:03:05.029 --> 01:03:05.039 align:start position:0%
you great okay my name is James Fox I'm
 
01:03:07.069 --> 01:03:07.079 align:start position:0%
the PNC director um you know the
 
01:03:09.870 --> 01:03:09.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner did such a great job with h
 
01:03:10.990 --> 01:03:11.000 align:start position:0%
kind of the run through of the
 
01:03:13.589 --> 01:03:13.599 align:start position:0%
department um I think I'll focus more on
 
01:03:15.349 --> 01:03:15.359 align:start position:0%
the people uh so I've been with the
 
01:03:17.109 --> 01:03:17.119 align:start position:0%
department for nine years I started as a
 
01:03:19.190 --> 01:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
PNC attorney and I've been the PNC
 
01:03:21.990 --> 01:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
director for about four years um
 
01:03:24.349 --> 01:03:24.359 align:start position:0%
property casualty uh I think most people
 
01:03:26.109 --> 01:03:26.119 align:start position:0%
probably more easily think about that a
 
01:03:28.069 --> 01:03:28.079 align:start position:0%
property and liability insurance so
 
01:03:29.789 --> 01:03:29.799 align:start position:0%
that's uh your auto insurance your
 
01:03:32.950 --> 01:03:32.960 align:start position:0%
homeor insurance umbrella coverage
 
01:03:34.390 --> 01:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
professional liability basically
 
01:03:35.510 --> 01:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
anything that's property that you're
 
01:03:37.309 --> 01:03:37.319 align:start position:0%
trying to protect or liability in case
 
01:03:38.549 --> 01:03:38.559 align:start position:0%
you hurt somebody else's property or
 
01:03:40.870 --> 01:03:40.880 align:start position:0%
somebody another person uh that's what
 
01:03:44.190 --> 01:03:44.200 align:start position:0%
we handle in PNC um our our really
 
01:03:46.750 --> 01:03:46.760 align:start position:0%
department has three prongs the the
 
01:03:48.670 --> 01:03:48.680 align:start position:0%
first two prongs are primarily front end
 
01:03:50.309 --> 01:03:50.319 align:start position:0%
that's we review all a lot of the
 
01:03:52.390 --> 01:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
insurance forms that are used in the
 
01:03:53.670 --> 01:03:53.680 align:start position:0%
state to make sure they're compliant
 
01:03:56.390 --> 01:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
with our regulatory laws and uh we also
 
01:03:57.950 --> 01:03:57.960 align:start position:0%
look at the rates to make sure they're
 
01:04:00.829 --> 01:04:00.839 align:start position:0%
not uh inadequate uh and not
 
01:04:03.430 --> 01:04:03.440 align:start position:0%
discriminatory and then on the back end
 
01:04:06.950 --> 01:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh we um have a market conduct unit uh
 
01:04:08.990 --> 01:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
and that unit uh goes into the insurance
 
01:04:11.470 --> 01:04:11.480 align:start position:0%
companies and they make sure as it says
 
01:04:12.789 --> 01:04:12.799 align:start position:0%
that the conduct of the insurance
 
01:04:15.549 --> 01:04:15.559 align:start position:0%
companies is consistent with our laws
 
01:04:17.670 --> 01:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
that have been obviously passed by the
 
01:04:19.750 --> 01:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
legislature um that's and then the other
 
01:04:21.029 --> 01:04:21.039 align:start position:0%
thing we do obviously do consumer
 
01:04:22.670 --> 01:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
complaints and I will sit in all
 
01:04:23.990 --> 01:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
consumer complaints and review every
 
01:04:25.789 --> 01:04:25.799 align:start position:0%
single one of them along with the PNC
 
01:04:28.910 --> 01:04:28.920 align:start position:0%
attorney Emily dhy um the commissioner
 
01:04:32.670 --> 01:04:32.680 align:start position:0%
the PNC team that's uh myself as the PNC
 
01:04:35.309 --> 01:04:35.319 align:start position:0%
director chrisan citarella who's the
 
01:04:39.190 --> 01:04:39.200 align:start position:0%
actuary uh he knows all about rates and
 
01:04:42.190 --> 01:04:42.200 align:start position:0%
uh adequate inadequate um discrimination
 
01:04:45.670 --> 01:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
all that and then Emily dhy uh who's our
 
01:04:48.430 --> 01:04:48.440 align:start position:0%
attorney uh and she if we have any legal
 
01:04:50.309 --> 01:04:50.319 align:start position:0%
questions that we're unsure about um we
 
01:04:53.390 --> 01:04:53.400 align:start position:0%
go to her uh and she helps us with that
 
01:04:56.309 --> 01:04:56.319 align:start position:0%
so as to testimony uh you'll hear
 
01:04:58.589 --> 01:04:58.599 align:start position:0%
probably from all three of us and
 
01:05:02.150 --> 01:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
sometimes the multiples and then um you
 
01:05:04.190 --> 01:05:04.200 align:start position:0%
know this year things that outside of
 
01:05:05.630 --> 01:05:05.640 align:start position:0%
our bills things that we probably will
 
01:05:07.470 --> 01:05:07.480 align:start position:0%
be over there on that come to mind are
 
01:05:10.190 --> 01:05:10.200 align:start position:0%
there's a a bill in an auto minimum
 
01:05:12.190 --> 01:05:12.200 align:start position:0%
limits that we have something to say
 
01:05:14.630 --> 01:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
about there's a new bill again back
 
01:05:16.870 --> 01:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
that's on travel insurance that will
 
01:05:18.829 --> 01:05:18.839 align:start position:0%
have something to say about and there's
 
01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
another one comes to mind is the storage
 
01:05:22.190 --> 01:05:22.200 align:start position:0%
facilities uh producer licensing
 
01:05:26.309 --> 01:05:26.319 align:start position:0%
requirements so that's um basically uh
 
01:05:28.990 --> 01:05:29.000 align:start position:0%
who I am and who our little team is also
 
01:05:30.710 --> 01:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
at you know at the department we have
 
01:05:33.870 --> 01:05:33.880 align:start position:0%
probably 15 people that do PNC and
 
01:05:35.549 --> 01:05:35.559 align:start position:0%
probably hundreds of years of experience
 
01:05:38.510 --> 01:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
so we do have a lot of knowledge uh and
 
01:05:41.269 --> 01:05:41.279 align:start position:0%
we uh all love PNC and we look forward
 
01:05:46.990 --> 01:05:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
committee right excuse me Mr chairman I
 
01:05:52.230 --> 01:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
just want to break in and and I see that
 
01:05:54.190 --> 01:05:54.200 align:start position:0%
um Doug and the commissioner both have
 
01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
turned their video on and I think that
 
01:05:57.510 --> 01:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
that's that's helpful and and anybody
 
01:05:59.430 --> 01:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
who's a panelist will have the uh
 
01:06:02.430 --> 01:06:02.440 align:start position:0%
ability to turn their their video on so
 
01:06:05.069 --> 01:06:05.079 align:start position:0%
I wasn't sure that they yeah
 
01:06:08.269 --> 01:06:08.279 align:start position:0%
okay do that or qu do that right it all
 
01:06:10.269 --> 01:06:10.279 align:start position:0%
depends if you have a camera of course
 
01:06:11.630 --> 01:06:11.640 align:start position:0%
right well I can see your name but I
 
01:06:14.150 --> 01:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
don't see your picture I I turned myself
 
01:06:18.269 --> 01:06:18.279 align:start position:0%
off I'm in the background but I'm here
 
01:06:19.430 --> 01:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
okay all
 
01:06:22.230 --> 01:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
right um all right commissioner who's
 
01:06:25.190 --> 01:06:25.200 align:start position:0%
who's up next I am John it's Tyler
 
01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:26.870 align:start position:0%
who's up next I am John it's Tyler
Brandon

01:06:26.870 --> 01:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
Brandon
 
01:06:28.710 --> 01:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
of Health economics with the Department
 
01:06:30.230 --> 01:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
I've had a few different titles with the
 
01:06:32.390 --> 01:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
department and uh I'm real familiar I
 
01:06:34.510 --> 01:06:34.520 align:start position:0%
think to folks like representative hun
 
01:06:35.589 --> 01:06:35.599 align:start position:0%
and some of the others that have been on
 
01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
the the committee for a while um we've
 
01:06:40.109 --> 01:06:40.119 align:start position:0%
had some staff changes on the life and
 
01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:41.640 align:start position:0%
health side but you should feel free to
 
01:06:43.910 --> 01:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
to contact me on on any of those related
 
01:06:45.829 --> 01:06:45.839 align:start position:0%
issues do what the commissioner needs me
 
01:06:48.349 --> 01:06:48.359 align:start position:0%
to do on that front and um happy to
 
01:06:50.470 --> 01:06:50.480 align:start position:0%
provide kind of the policy input to this
 
01:06:53.549 --> 01:06:53.559 align:start position:0%
committee as I have in the past um we do
 
01:06:55.150 --> 01:06:55.160 align:start position:0%
a lot of the same work on the life and
 
01:06:56.910 --> 01:06:56.920 align:start position:0%
health as we do on the property and
 
01:06:58.789 --> 01:06:58.799 align:start position:0%
Casualty side the market conduct the
 
01:07:01.309 --> 01:07:01.319 align:start position:0%
form review the rate review uh what I
 
01:07:03.269 --> 01:07:03.279 align:start position:0%
have listed here are some of the the
 
01:07:05.750 --> 01:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
main topic areas you're likely to see
 
01:07:07.430 --> 01:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
legislation um in front of this
 
01:07:09.190 --> 01:07:09.200 align:start position:0%
committee on and one of the things
 
01:07:10.670 --> 01:07:10.680 align:start position:0%
that's a little unique about that the
 
01:07:13.029 --> 01:07:13.039 align:start position:0%
life and health um or at least the
 
01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
health particularly since the passage of
 
01:07:16.870 --> 01:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
the ACA is we're constantly thinking
 
01:07:18.470 --> 01:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
about the the interaction between
 
01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
federal and state laws and U with the
 
01:07:23.829 --> 01:07:23.839 align:start position:0%
ACA has set certain Market rules that
 
01:07:25.670 --> 01:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
all the states had to follow that that
 
01:07:27.190 --> 01:07:27.200 align:start position:0%
being said there's still a fair amount
 
01:07:29.309 --> 01:07:29.319 align:start position:0%
of flexibility at the state level we
 
01:07:30.789 --> 01:07:30.799 align:start position:0%
just need to make sure that we don't run
 
01:07:33.789 --> 01:07:33.799 align:start position:0%
into issues of federal preemption and
 
01:07:36.510 --> 01:07:36.520 align:start position:0%
those ACA Market rules tend to to be
 
01:07:38.349 --> 01:07:38.359 align:start position:0%
most relevant for the exchange products
 
01:07:40.589 --> 01:07:40.599 align:start position:0%
for the individual Market um that being
 
01:07:41.750 --> 01:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
said we're always thinking about our
 
01:07:44.069 --> 01:07:44.079 align:start position:0%
Market stability which has a lot to do
 
01:07:46.029 --> 01:07:46.039 align:start position:0%
with the underlying risk selection you
 
01:07:48.470 --> 01:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
are likely to see bills that come before
 
01:07:50.829 --> 01:07:50.839 align:start position:0%
you expanding coverage one way or
 
01:07:53.109 --> 01:07:53.119 align:start position:0%
another um there's traditional Insurance
 
01:07:54.670 --> 01:07:54.680 align:start position:0%
mandates that change the scope of
 
01:07:56.789 --> 01:07:56.799 align:start position:0%
services after to be covered but you
 
01:07:58.990 --> 01:07:59.000 align:start position:0%
will also see a lot of other legislation
 
01:08:00.990 --> 01:08:01.000 align:start position:0%
that looks at kind of first dollar cost
 
01:08:04.150 --> 01:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
sharing as Services um are trying to be
 
01:08:06.390 --> 01:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
protected keep the patient out of it
 
01:08:09.029 --> 01:08:09.039 align:start position:0%
those types of legislation do run up
 
01:08:11.269 --> 01:08:11.279 align:start position:0%
against sometimes tax laws we do try to
 
01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
provide some insight on that front
 
01:08:15.789 --> 01:08:15.799 align:start position:0%
clearly it's not our expertise but um
 
01:08:18.229 --> 01:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
tele medicine prescription drugs are big
 
01:08:19.950 --> 01:08:19.960 align:start position:0%
cost driver or at least the prescription
 
01:08:22.149 --> 01:08:22.159 align:start position:0%
drugs are a big cost driver area tele
 
01:08:23.789 --> 01:08:23.799 align:start position:0%
medicine is obviously a topic of
 
01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
Interest particularly lately and
 
01:08:27.870 --> 01:08:27.880 align:start position:0%
expanding access to those types of
 
01:08:29.630 --> 01:08:29.640 align:start position:0%
services so you're probably going to see
 
01:08:31.910 --> 01:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
legislation on that front if not this
 
01:08:34.430 --> 01:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
year um in the next couple of years one
 
01:08:35.910 --> 01:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
of the other areas that comes up all the
 
01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
time is price transparency and I am
 
01:08:40.229 --> 01:08:40.239 align:start position:0%
happy to say that the insurance
 
01:08:43.149 --> 01:08:43.159 align:start position:0%
department has been a national leader on
 
01:08:44.590 --> 01:08:44.600 align:start position:0%
this front with our New Hampshire Health
 
01:08:47.349 --> 01:08:47.359 align:start position:0%
cost website where we have been posting
 
01:08:49.789 --> 01:08:49.799 align:start position:0%
the actual price of health care services
 
01:08:53.510 --> 01:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
for um what is actually about 14 years
 
01:08:55.749 --> 01:08:55.759 align:start position:0%
and uh that's received a lot of national
 
01:08:58.510 --> 01:08:58.520 align:start position:0%
attention it is often given as a reason
 
01:09:00.630 --> 01:09:00.640 align:start position:0%
not to require Health Care Providers or
 
01:09:03.110 --> 01:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
carriers to do something instead uh that
 
01:09:04.709 --> 01:09:04.719 align:start position:0%
being said there are new federal
 
01:09:06.309 --> 01:09:06.319 align:start position:0%
requirements coming down the pipe for
 
01:09:09.229 --> 01:09:09.239 align:start position:0%
both providers and insurers finally we
 
01:09:12.269 --> 01:09:12.279 align:start position:0%
are actually statuto required to put on
 
01:09:14.229 --> 01:09:14.239 align:start position:0%

to link it into the the text box but I
 
01:12:57.310 --> 01:12:57.320 align:start position:0%

01:12:58.830 --> 01:12:58.840 align:start position:0%
already sent it to Pam ahead of time so
 
01:12:59.669 --> 01:12:59.679 align:start position:0%

we'll we'll
 
01:13:13.910 --> 01:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
see good okay um so uh now we'll we'll
 
01:13:15.709 --> 01:13:15.719 align:start position:0%
try something even more daring we'll ask
 
01:13:19.270 --> 01:13:19.280 align:start position:0%
the committee members if they have any
 
01:13:21.590 --> 01:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
questions so if a committee member has a
 
01:13:25.510 --> 01:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
question raise your hand and uh and and
 
01:13:27.750 --> 01:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
I'll recognize you to ask your question
 
01:13:29.990 --> 01:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:13:32.709 --> 01:13:32.719 align:start position:0%
department any
 
01:13:36.750 --> 01:13:36.760 align:start position:0%
questions um in the meantime um just my
 
01:13:39.510 --> 01:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
my overview of insurance and and and I
 
01:13:41.510 --> 01:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
know you know they did excellent job in
 
01:13:43.510 --> 01:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
presenting it but um the things that I'd
 
01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
like to emphasize to everyone is that um
 
01:13:49.510 --> 01:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
the the initial purpose and as they
 
01:13:51.470 --> 01:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
described it was that it was solvency
 
01:13:54.350 --> 01:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
solvency is really a critical element of
 
01:13:55.750 --> 01:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
what our department is supposed to be
 
01:13:57.990 --> 01:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
doing is making sure a company is
 
01:14:01.310 --> 01:14:01.320 align:start position:0%
charging enough rates so often people
 
01:14:03.629 --> 01:14:03.639 align:start position:0%
will say well why aren't we regulating
 
01:14:06.030 --> 01:14:06.040 align:start position:0%
rates why don't we telling them to to
 
01:14:07.550 --> 01:14:07.560 align:start position:0%
stop raising their rates and none of
 
01:14:10.510 --> 01:14:10.520 align:start position:0%
this and that's not really actually what
 
01:14:13.030 --> 01:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
our our mission our mission is to is to
 
01:14:15.070 --> 01:14:15.080 align:start position:0%
make sure that they can make those
 
01:14:17.189 --> 01:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
payments make the um you know the
 
01:14:19.790 --> 01:14:19.800 align:start position:0%
payouts that they're responsible for um
 
01:14:22.669 --> 01:14:22.679 align:start position:0%
health insurance is different um I often
 
01:14:24.470 --> 01:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
say to everybody um health insurance is
 
01:14:25.950 --> 01:14:25.960 align:start position:0%
not insurance
 
01:14:28.430 --> 01:14:28.440 align:start position:0%
because um as compared to property and
 
01:14:30.350 --> 01:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
casual I hope never to make a claim I
 
01:14:32.070 --> 01:14:32.080 align:start position:0%
hope my house never burns down and I
 
01:14:35.110 --> 01:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
know my car never gets stolen um whereas
 
01:14:37.189 --> 01:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
health insurance we all need it we all
 
01:14:39.030 --> 01:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
use it it's a you know it's an employer
 
01:14:41.709 --> 01:14:41.719 align:start position:0%
benefit originally it was you know there
 
01:14:43.430 --> 01:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
I remember the days when health
 
01:14:45.750 --> 01:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
insurance was actually a throwin it was
 
01:14:48.390 --> 01:14:48.400 align:start position:0%
actually u a life insurance policy you
 
01:14:49.870 --> 01:14:49.880 align:start position:0%
got you know employer would provide a
 
01:14:51.910 --> 01:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
$10,000 life insurance policy to her
 
01:14:53.709 --> 01:14:53.719 align:start position:0%
employees and the health insurance was
 
01:14:56.149 --> 01:14:56.159 align:start position:0%
sort of an add-on to it um that was a
 
01:14:57.790 --> 01:14:57.800 align:start position:0%
long long time
 
01:15:01.390 --> 01:15:01.400 align:start position:0%
ago compared to manag care today um so
 
01:15:04.430 --> 01:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
we we do have some regulatory system in
 
01:15:06.790 --> 01:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
place for uh rates when it comes to
 
01:15:08.950 --> 01:15:08.960 align:start position:0%
health insurance um that is federally
 
01:15:11.550 --> 01:15:11.560 align:start position:0%
mandated and and in that case it is the
 
01:15:13.910 --> 01:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
maximum amount of Premium they can
 
01:15:16.830 --> 01:15:16.840 align:start position:0%
charge um and it is based upon their uh
 
01:15:18.709 --> 01:15:18.719 align:start position:0%
payout and percentages that they're
 
01:15:20.110 --> 01:15:20.120 align:start position:0%
allowed to keep for their operating you
 
01:15:22.229 --> 01:15:22.239 align:start position:0%
know 10 to 15 I forget for individual
 
01:15:24.390 --> 01:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
and in group or something you know is
 
01:15:27.189 --> 01:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
that right am I got it got that right
 
01:15:28.950 --> 01:15:28.960 align:start position:0%
yeah it's either 15 or 20 depending on
 
01:15:32.629 --> 01:15:32.639 align:start position:0%
the size right 15 or 20 okay so and so
 
01:15:35.350 --> 01:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
there there is some maximums and and so
 
01:15:37.790 --> 01:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
or like I say health insurance is it's
 
01:15:40.390 --> 01:15:40.400 align:start position:0%
it's a stretch to call it insurance but
 
01:15:42.310 --> 01:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
uh NE to say it is it is something that
 
01:15:44.270 --> 01:15:44.280 align:start position:0%
takes a lot of our time a lot of what
 
01:15:46.590 --> 01:15:46.600 align:start position:0%
goes on with the Department is is
 
01:15:48.830 --> 01:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
related to insurance and I would say um
 
01:15:51.229 --> 01:15:51.239 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of our our health
 
01:15:53.510 --> 01:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
insurance of our insurance bills usually
 
01:15:55.350 --> 01:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
have some health related to it and
 
01:15:57.390 --> 01:15:57.400 align:start position:0%
that's why we know Tyler and and so
 
01:15:59.550 --> 01:15:59.560 align:start position:0%
Tyler you said 14 years since that
 
01:16:01.550 --> 01:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
that's been wasn't that your program so
 
01:16:02.990 --> 01:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
that that make me know that you've been
 
01:16:06.350 --> 01:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:08.350 --> 01:16:08.360 align:start position:0%
years that's correct I'm getting close
 
01:16:10.990 --> 01:16:11.000 align:start position:0%
to 15 will'll be uh this year in 2021
 
01:16:13.629 --> 01:16:13.639 align:start position:0%
and put up the website within six months
 
01:16:17.550 --> 01:16:17.560 align:start position:0%
um of me being here so uh yeah and kind
 
01:16:20.110 --> 01:16:20.120 align:start position:0%
of a pretty small operation just we use
 
01:16:22.470 --> 01:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
the clams data which uh was the result
 
01:16:24.510 --> 01:16:24.520 align:start position:0%
of legislation um that did go through
 
01:16:25.430 --> 01:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
01:16:27.590 --> 01:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
requiring the insurers and tpas to send
 
01:16:30.629 --> 01:16:30.639 align:start position:0%
anonymous claims to the state and the
 
01:16:32.430 --> 01:16:32.440 align:start position:0%
insurance Authority and we use those
 
01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
detailed claims data to to show rates
 
01:16:36.790 --> 01:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
that are actually paid to the provider
 
01:16:40.030 --> 01:16:40.040 align:start position:0%
not just charges and um that would allow
 
01:16:42.229 --> 01:16:42.239 align:start position:0%
patients to understand their liability
 
01:16:43.070 --> 01:16:43.080 align:start position:0%
particularly if they have a high
 
01:16:46.430 --> 01:16:46.440 align:start position:0%
deductible Health Plan and um yeah so um
 
01:16:49.390 --> 01:16:49.400 align:start position:0%
CNN New York Times Wall Street Journal
 
01:16:51.070 --> 01:16:51.080 align:start position:0%

01:16:54.189 --> 01:16:54.199 align:start position:0%

screen okay it it hopefully is is
 
01:18:26.790 --> 01:18:26.800 align:start position:0%
somewhere easy to find I know sometimes
 
01:18:29.390 --> 01:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
it's upper right um sometimes it's at
 
01:18:31.709 --> 01:18:31.719 align:start position:0%
the very bottom of the participant um
 
01:18:34.550 --> 01:18:34.560 align:start position:0%
list and there's a there are three dots
 
01:18:37.950 --> 01:18:37.960 align:start position:0%
that give um more options
 
01:18:40.910 --> 01:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
and if if you look around and get used
 
01:18:43.270 --> 01:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
to where you um where it is on your
 
01:18:46.070 --> 01:18:46.080 align:start position:0%

01:22:24.030 --> 01:22:24.040 align:start position:0%
happy to look into it if you still have
 
01:22:25.430 --> 01:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
that non resident license that
 
01:22:27.709 --> 01:22:27.719 align:start position:0%
potentially is subject to no I had to I
 
01:22:29.950 --> 01:22:29.960 align:start position:0%
had to give that up but I I you know
 
01:22:31.669 --> 01:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
when I moved to other states they've
 
01:22:33.110 --> 01:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
honored it and the Hampshire was the
 
01:22:34.550 --> 01:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
only one that didn't unless somebody
 
01:22:37.590 --> 01:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
told me wrong well how how long ago was
 
01:22:40.990 --> 01:22:41.000 align:start position:0%
this oh this was five years ago oh
 
01:22:43.229 --> 01:22:43.239 align:start position:0%
because we've we've been more recently
 
01:22:46.229 --> 01:22:46.239 align:start position:0%
upgrading our our reciprocity yeah it it
 
01:22:48.470 --> 01:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
just didn't seem to me to be right I I
 
01:22:50.550 --> 01:22:50.560 align:start position:0%
could change my driver's license right
 
01:22:53.629 --> 01:22:53.639 align:start position:0%
away but uh you know it was at my age it
 
01:22:55.750 --> 01:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
was too much to take sitting in a
 
01:22:58.590 --> 01:22:58.600 align:start position:0%
classroom for another 40 hours so anyway
 
01:23:00.110 --> 01:23:00.120 align:start position:0%

01:23:20.070 --> 01:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
top of my head but that's the statute
 
01:23:21.470 --> 01:23:21.480 align:start position:0%

01:23:50.350 --> 01:23:50.360 align:start position:0%
for the committee members um uh okay

we're we're done for lunch and lunch I I
 
01:23:55.070 --> 01:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
try to schedule this up so we don't
 
01:23:57.830 --> 01:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
spend too much time in front of the our
 
01:23:59.830 --> 01:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
computers here um so we'll do the
 
01:24:02.669 --> 01:24:02.679 align:start position:0%
banking Department in 115 um but the
 
01:24:04.430 --> 01:24:04.440 align:start position:0%
last last thing I'd like to do is give
 
01:24:06.189 --> 01:24:06.199 align:start position:0%
you guys all a little bit of a homework
 
01:24:09.310 --> 01:24:09.320 align:start position:0%
homework assignment and That is um you
 
01:24:10.990 --> 01:24:11.000 align:start position:0%
don't have to do it today obviously
 
01:24:12.590 --> 01:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
because or tomorrow because you might
 
01:24:14.830 --> 01:24:14.840 align:start position:0%
want to hear all the different builds um
 
01:24:17.790 --> 01:24:17.800 align:start position:0%
in different issues but uh I will still
 
01:24:21.310 --> 01:24:21.320 align:start position:0%
create my standing three divisions so
 
01:24:23.750 --> 01:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
that is Insurance uh Banking and
 
01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:24.990 align:start position:0%
that is Insurance uh Banking and
business

01:24:24.990 --> 01:24:25.000 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:24:26.950 --> 01:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
and liquor and
 
01:24:29.590 --> 01:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
Hospitality um the banking business also
 
01:24:32.910 --> 01:24:32.920 align:start position:0%
includes Condos for people who are
 
01:24:35.629 --> 01:24:35.639 align:start position:0%
condos or or time sharing representative
 
01:24:37.990 --> 01:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
ham I remember you had a time sharing
 
01:24:40.790 --> 01:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
bill in the committee many years ago but
 
01:24:42.990 --> 01:24:43.000 align:start position:0%
um so any those are the three different
 
01:24:45.430 --> 01:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
divisions and obviously probably best to
 
01:24:47.470 --> 01:24:47.480 align:start position:0%
hear all the Department's presentations
 
01:24:49.310 --> 01:24:49.320 align:start position:0%
then before you want to make a decision
 
01:24:51.709 --> 01:24:51.719 align:start position:0%
which one you want to go to um but like
 
01:24:52.870 --> 01:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
I said
 
01:24:55.550 --> 01:24:55.560 align:start position:0%
earlier I don't plan to have too much
 
01:24:57.270 --> 01:24:57.280 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work you know I just can't
 
01:24:59.070 --> 01:24:59.080 align:start position:0%
imagine unless it's really just tweaking
 
01:25:01.669 --> 01:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
little things but that will generally uh
 
01:25:04.270 --> 01:25:04.280 align:start position:0%
retain retain everything till September
 
01:25:05.750 --> 01:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh representative Bartlett you have your
 
01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:07.030 align:start position:0%

Zoom um so I won't be able to be here at
 
01:25:16.990 --> 01:25:17.000 align:start position:0%

01:25:19.510 --> 01:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
about the banking Department
 
01:25:21.790 --> 01:25:21.800 align:start position:0%

01:25:24.470 --> 01:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
insurance insurance subdivision division
 
01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:26.229 align:start position:0%
insurance insurance subdivision division

01:25:54.669 --> 01:25:54.679 align:start position:0%
some more hands up uh Paul Terry
 
01:25:57.149 --> 01:25:57.159 align:start position:0%
representative Terry yeah U Mr chairman
 
01:26:01.109 --> 01:26:01.119 align:start position:0%
in uh in my past uh experiences it's
 
01:26:05.070 --> 01:26:05.080 align:start position:0%
it's been typical uh when uh bodies or
 
01:26:07.470 --> 01:26:07.480 align:start position:0%
uh committees are meeting to have a
 
01:26:09.830 --> 01:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
projected uh ending time did did I
 
01:26:12.229 --> 01:26:12.239 align:start position:0%
happen to miss that today I saw the
 
01:26:14.109 --> 01:26:14.119 align:start position:0%
meeting began at 10: amm but I had no
 
01:26:16.790 --> 01:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
idea how long the the day was going U
 
01:26:18.709 --> 01:26:18.719 align:start position:0%
here's the bad news no we don't give you
 
01:26:18.719 --> 01:26:20.510 align:start position:0%
here's the bad news no we don't give you
ending

01:26:20.510 --> 01:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
ending
 
01:26:23.109 --> 01:26:23.119 align:start position:0%
times reason well it's in general I
 
01:26:25.750 --> 01:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
would say in general when it comes to a
 
01:26:27.750 --> 01:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
hearing when we actually hear bills
 
01:26:29.030 --> 01:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to tell you what time the
 
01:26:31.430 --> 01:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
bill is scheduled for but no we don't
 
01:26:32.990 --> 01:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
have an end dat because we never know
 
01:26:35.830 --> 01:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
how long people were there and we um you
 
01:26:37.830 --> 01:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
know we everyone gets an opportunity to
 
01:26:40.950 --> 01:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
speak so that can go on forever and ever
 
01:26:43.350 --> 01:26:43.360 align:start position:0%
so the big problems that might occur is
 
01:26:46.470 --> 01:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
when bills uh are are start to overlap
 
01:26:49.430 --> 01:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
another bill in terms of times and then
 
01:26:53.270 --> 01:26:53.280 align:start position:0%
it's up to the chair to um maybe recess
 
01:26:56.870 --> 01:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
and uh uh I would recess a hearing open
 
01:26:59.070 --> 01:26:59.080 align:start position:0%
the other hearing announce when we would
 
01:27:01.830 --> 01:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
then reschedule but again it's never in
 
01:27:04.270 --> 01:27:04.280 align:start position:0%
end times I I wish it is funny you would
 
01:27:05.430 --> 01:27:05.440 align:start position:0%
point that out I never really thought
 
01:27:07.950 --> 01:27:07.960 align:start position:0%
about that we don't ever well that makes
 
01:27:09.950 --> 01:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
the end times that makes eminently good
 
01:27:12.390 --> 01:27:12.400 align:start position:0%
sense given the nature of the ongoing
 
01:27:14.189 --> 01:27:14.199 align:start position:0%
work of the committee I was thinking
 
01:27:16.430 --> 01:27:16.440 align:start position:0%
specifically of the orientation and a
 
01:27:18.430 --> 01:27:18.440 align:start position:0%
program that had been developed for
 
01:27:21.470 --> 01:27:21.480 align:start position:0%
today yeah so so um I I don't know the
 
01:27:23.550 --> 01:27:23.560 align:start position:0%
schedule that was uh I assume was
 
01:27:25.790 --> 01:27:25.800 align:start position:0%
emailed out him emailed it out but it
 
01:27:27.669 --> 01:27:27.679 align:start position:0%
just has the starting time so you can
 
01:27:30.550 --> 01:27:30.560 align:start position:0%
you can tell the end time is uh uh
 
01:27:33.830 --> 01:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
either lunch the appropriate lunch hour
 
01:27:35.990 --> 01:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh for today this so noon you know and
 
01:27:37.750 --> 01:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
would have been and then so I give I
 
01:27:39.109 --> 01:27:39.119 align:start position:0%
always try to give an hour and 15
 
01:27:41.350 --> 01:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
minutes for lunch and then and so the
 
01:27:43.629 --> 01:27:43.639 align:start position:0%
banking will get back together today at
 
01:27:46.350 --> 01:27:46.360 align:start position:0%

01:29:28.270 --> 01:29:28.280 align:start position:0%
fors I don't really have a a a concrete
 
01:29:30.750 --> 01:29:30.760 align:start position:0%
answer I know that that that bills will
 
01:29:33.310 --> 01:29:33.320 align:start position:0%
you know certainly be easily distributed
 
01:29:35.270 --> 01:29:35.280 align:start position:0%
to anybody who comes to conquer to meet
 
01:29:37.910 --> 01:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
in the committee room but that's one of
 
01:29:41.350 --> 01:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
the the the issues that is um not
 
01:29:44.109 --> 01:29:44.119 align:start position:0%
settled as far as I know how much
 
01:29:46.750 --> 01:29:46.760 align:start position:0%
material will be mailed to people's
 
01:29:50.750 --> 01:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
homes um we hope to have a a a robust
 
01:29:52.629 --> 01:29:52.639 align:start position:0%
system where we have an electronic file
 
01:29:55.270 --> 01:29:55.280 align:start position:0%
with any you know testimony that's
 
01:29:57.870 --> 01:29:57.880 align:start position:0%
submitted and you know accessible to the
 
01:30:00.750 --> 01:30:00.760 align:start position:0%
committee members as we go forward
 
01:30:03.109 --> 01:30:03.119 align:start position:0%
electronically but uh as far as hard
 
01:30:06.750 --> 01:30:06.760 align:start position:0%
copies of every document well I don't I
 
01:30:09.750 --> 01:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
don't think that's uh hard copies is is
 
01:30:12.070 --> 01:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
uh the best way to go if you can get
 
01:30:15.149 --> 01:30:15.159 align:start position:0%
somebody to have a digital library or a
 
01:30:17.669 --> 01:30:17.679 align:start position:0%
digital folder that's the that's the
 
01:30:20.830 --> 01:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
hope but it it I can't say it's it's
 
01:30:23.510 --> 01:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
established um right this minute you
 
01:30:26.430 --> 01:30:26.440 align:start position:0%
know so that's they're working working
 
01:30:29.350 --> 01:30:29.360 align:start position:0%
on it and yes a work in progress in the
 
01:30:31.390 --> 01:30:31.400 align:start position:0%
perfect world or what we hope the end
 
01:30:35.109 --> 01:30:35.119 align:start position:0%
game is that um you we would be able to
 
01:30:36.790 --> 01:30:36.800 align:start position:0%
have a library in which you can then go
 
01:30:39.270 --> 01:30:39.280 align:start position:0%
search bills by there uh as though as
 
01:30:40.550 --> 01:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
though you went into the committee room
 
01:30:43.149 --> 01:30:43.159 align:start position:0%
and pulled out the folder right well
 
01:30:44.990 --> 01:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
otherwise I have to go visit John every
 
01:30:47.189 --> 01:30:47.199 align:start position:0%
day and I you know I I don't want to
 
01:30:49.669 --> 01:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
burden him with uh
 
01:30:52.430 --> 01:30:52.440 align:start position:0%

our bills last year um just so people
 
01:31:50.070 --> 01:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
have an idea do have you had any any
 
01:31:52.830 --> 01:31:52.840 align:start position:0%
bills assigned yet Mr chair so if you
 
01:31:56.030 --> 01:31:56.040 align:start position:0%
were to go on online um and I have not
 
01:31:58.550 --> 01:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
done it today but online there would if
 
01:32:00.510 --> 01:32:00.520 align:start position:0%
you go to the Advan search it says we
 
01:32:04.030 --> 01:32:04.040 align:start position:0%

I had to start another notebook last
 
01:32:19.149 --> 01:32:19.159 align:start position:0%

01:32:21.030 --> 01:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
had three 4 inch
 
01:32:23.430 --> 01:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
binders and asked Chris we used to go
 
01:32:25.390 --> 01:32:25.400 align:start position:0%

Committee will return at 115 yeah but do
 
01:37:17.950 --> 01:37:17.960 align:start position:0%
you see the whole um heading up here I
 
01:37:20.109 --> 01:37:20.119 align:start position:0%
do I do yeah that's what I'm trying to
 
01:37:22.550 --> 01:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
figure out why it's doing that and I why
 
01:37:24.870 --> 01:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
it's not just the document but can't
 
01:37:28.950 --> 01:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
toar yeah I need to hide the fold the
 
01:37:32.709 --> 01:37:32.719 align:start position:0%
um you know the right how to skew go to
 
01:37:35.310 --> 01:37:35.320 align:start position:0%
view there you go is that's better right
 
01:37:37.910 --> 01:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
yep yep that's cool that's it's the
 
01:37:40.950 --> 01:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
word so is there anything I meant to did
 
01:37:43.550 --> 01:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
you see my email about sharing
 
01:37:46.149 --> 01:37:46.159 align:start position:0%
screens I have not I did not look at any
 
01:37:50.350 --> 01:37:50.360 align:start position:0%
emails no okay I I um I had hadn't told
 
01:37:52.709 --> 01:37:52.719 align:start position:0%
you that when you when you enter the
 
01:37:55.390 --> 01:37:55.400 align:start position:0%
meeting it's set so only the host can
 
01:37:59.550 --> 01:37:59.560 align:start position:0%
share a screen but um because you know
 
01:38:01.189 --> 01:38:01.199 align:start position:0%
the insurance department is much easier
 
01:38:03.510 --> 01:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
if the if somebody else does it you know
 
01:38:05.589 --> 01:38:05.599 align:start position:0%
if the person
 
01:38:08.270 --> 01:38:08.280 align:start position:0%
talking all you need to do is go to the
 
01:38:10.870 --> 01:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
the bottom center of the screen it says
 
01:38:12.709 --> 01:38:12.719 align:start position:0%
share screen right where it says share
 
01:38:15.470 --> 01:38:15.480 align:start position:0%
screen there's a little up carrot yep
 
01:38:17.229 --> 01:38:17.239 align:start position:0%
and then it gives you that that you see
 
01:38:20.270 --> 01:38:20.280 align:start position:0%
that the buttons for only host only host
 
01:38:22.669 --> 01:38:22.679 align:start position:0%
or all panel all panelists so that's
 
01:38:25.189 --> 01:38:25.199 align:start position:0%
that's how you do the screen
 
01:38:28.310 --> 01:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
share so then anybody who's a panelist
 
01:38:32.270 --> 01:38:32.280 align:start position:0%
can share now for some reason Tyler came
 
01:38:35.629 --> 01:38:35.639 align:start position:0%
in as an attendee we made him you know
 
01:38:39.510 --> 01:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
you made him a panelist and I couldn't
 
01:38:41.550 --> 01:38:41.560 align:start position:0%
there was no option to return him to the
 
01:38:44.950 --> 01:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
attendee list and I it's like he was he
 
01:38:48.750 --> 01:38:48.760 align:start position:0%
was a permanent panelist so I I couldn't
 
01:38:50.229 --> 01:38:50.239 align:start position:0%
change him so I just emailed him and
 
01:38:52.430 --> 01:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
told him you're a panelist until you go
 
01:38:55.270 --> 01:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
out and come back as an attendee you
 
01:38:57.189 --> 01:38:57.199 align:start position:0%
know usually a panelist speaks and then
 
01:38:58.709 --> 01:38:58.719 align:start position:0%
just leaves the meeting so it's not a
 
01:39:01.750 --> 01:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
big issue but I don't know what that I
 
01:39:03.669 --> 01:39:03.679 align:start position:0%
can't explain that well right now I'm
 
01:39:05.510 --> 01:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
looking at the panel panelists and I
 
01:39:07.270 --> 01:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
don't see him so he must have he must
 
01:39:09.390 --> 01:39:09.400 align:start position:0%
have yeah I think he probably left at
 
01:39:10.950 --> 01:39:10.960 align:start position:0%
lunchtime and if he comes I don't know
 
01:39:12.910 --> 01:39:12.920 align:start position:0%
why he would come back for banking but
 
01:39:15.510 --> 01:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
if he wanted to just for you know I
 
01:39:17.629 --> 01:39:17.639 align:start position:0%
don't know why well I did I did see
 
01:39:21.430 --> 01:39:21.440 align:start position:0%
Jerry little was on for
 
01:39:24.109 --> 01:39:24.119 align:start position:0%
insurance um the other thing I wanted to
 
01:39:25.669 --> 01:39:25.679 align:start position:0%
mention to you that I haven't told you
 
01:39:28.310 --> 01:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
yet is that tomorrow I you know I think
 
01:39:30.070 --> 01:39:30.080 align:start position:0%
I mentioned the reason we're starting at
 
01:39:32.550 --> 01:39:32.560 align:start position:0%
9ine is because I have Edna at 10: right
 
01:39:34.350 --> 01:39:34.360 align:start position:0%
right so that means I have to leave at
 
01:39:37.390 --> 01:39:37.400 align:start position:0%
9:30 yeah but another researcher will
 
01:39:40.750 --> 01:39:40.760 align:start position:0%
come on just so you have somebody to
 
01:39:43.229 --> 01:39:43.239 align:start position:0%
assist okay and the other thing that I
 
01:39:45.589 --> 01:39:45.599 align:start position:0%
have been doing is lowering hands if
 
01:39:47.629 --> 01:39:47.639 align:start position:0%
people people raise their hands but they
 
01:39:49.790 --> 01:39:49.800 align:start position:0%
they never lower remember to lower them
 
01:39:51.510 --> 01:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
ah okay I was wondering how that how
 
01:39:53.830 --> 01:39:53.840 align:start position:0%
that happened yeah yeah so it's it's
 
01:39:57.350 --> 01:39:57.360 align:start position:0%
it's easy you you see in their little um
 
01:39:59.149 --> 01:39:59.159 align:start position:0%
in their little panel where there once
 
01:40:02.390 --> 01:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
was a hand it's just has lower hand and
 
01:40:04.270 --> 01:40:04.280 align:start position:0%
you just click on that and that hands
 
01:40:06.149 --> 01:40:06.159 align:start position:0%
down so you don't have too many hands
 
01:40:09.550 --> 01:40:09.560 align:start position:0%
left up and you know you need them to be
 
01:40:11.470 --> 01:40:11.480 align:start position:0%
sounds good all right okay so have a
 
01:40:15.629 --> 01:40:15.639 align:start position:0%
good lunch you too take care bye bye
 
01:40:39.229 --> 01:40:39.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:39.239 --> 01:40:42.750 align:start position:0%
 
it

01:40:42.750 --> 01:40:42.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:42.760 --> 01:40:52.070 align:start position:0%
 
is

01:40:52.070 --> 01:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:19.109 --> 01:41:19.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:19.119 --> 01:41:52.229 align:start position:0%

03:06:04.710 --> 03:06:04.720 align:start position:0%
works what going away and coming back
 
03:06:06.070 --> 03:06:06.080 align:start position:0%
yeah this the first time I've I've done
 
03:06:10.830 --> 03:06:10.840 align:start position:0%
a redial back on the same Zoom notice so
 
03:06:14.429 --> 03:06:14.439 align:start position:0%
gee can we use this for tomorrow
 
03:06:18.110 --> 03:06:18.120 align:start position:0%
too you will
 
03:06:21.269 --> 03:06:21.279 align:start position:0%
oh not this not this uh link no no no
 
03:06:23.630 --> 03:06:23.640 align:start position:0%
tomorrow I have not sent tomorrow's link
 
03:06:25.469 --> 03:06:25.479 align:start position:0%
yet because I didn't want there to be
 
03:06:28.910 --> 03:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
any confusion about which was which and
 
03:06:30.790 --> 03:06:30.800 align:start position:0%
so I fig you know if we get we can use
 
03:06:32.710 --> 03:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
it to dial back in today can we use it
 
03:06:37.389 --> 03:06:37.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:40.309 --> 03:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
not I'm not a technology Guru so I'm
 
03:06:42.630 --> 03:06:42.640 align:start position:0%
just asking a question yeah I know I I
 
03:06:46.910 --> 03:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
know that the the basic hope um is that
 
03:06:49.349 --> 03:06:49.359 align:start position:0%
we'll have a set link for Commerce
 
03:06:51.590 --> 03:06:51.600 align:start position:0%
meetings perfect that's that's what I
 
03:06:54.229 --> 03:06:54.239 align:start position:0%
was alluding to right right that is
 
03:06:56.510 --> 03:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely so we don't have to have all
 
03:06:58.429 --> 03:06:58.439 align:start position:0%
this did you get the email and you know
 
03:07:00.469 --> 03:07:00.479 align:start position:0%
which address did it go to that you'll
 
03:07:02.910 --> 03:07:02.920 align:start position:0%
be able to save a link for commerce's
 
03:07:06.590 --> 03:07:06.600 align:start position:0%
Reserve block that's great that's that's
 
03:07:09.229 --> 03:07:09.239 align:start position:0%
the hope but I know I know Keith might
 
03:07:12.190 --> 03:07:12.200 align:start position:0%
be able to allude allude to more on the
 
03:07:19.229 --> 03:07:19.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:22.229 --> 03:07:22.239 align:start position:0%
well I think most people know more than
 
03:07:24.870 --> 03:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
I do about how it all works yeah I know
 
03:07:28.790 --> 03:07:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:31.870 --> 03:07:31.880 align:start position:0%
zoom my question my question is there a
 
03:07:34.870 --> 03:07:34.880 align:start position:0%
way for us to save that link within the
 
03:07:37.349 --> 03:07:37.359 align:start position:0%
program or do we have to always go back
 
03:07:40.110 --> 03:07:40.120 align:start position:0%
to the email to find the link
 
03:07:42.349 --> 03:07:42.359 align:start position:0%
again well I think the hope would be
 
03:07:45.790 --> 03:07:45.800 align:start position:0%
that you'd have a set link for your your
 
03:07:48.070 --> 03:07:48.080 align:start position:0%
you know Commerce reserved time and that
 
03:07:50.389 --> 03:07:50.399 align:start position:0%
you'd be able to save it you know
 
03:07:52.429 --> 03:07:52.439 align:start position:0%
somewhere in a document
 
03:07:55.670 --> 03:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
andwhere the same the same L yeah in
 
03:07:58.429 --> 03:07:58.439 align:start position:0%
your calendar too yep yeah but the one
 
03:08:01.790 --> 03:08:01.800 align:start position:0%
in the calendar is is the attendee link
 
03:08:03.830 --> 03:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
the links that are emailed to you are
 
03:08:06.110 --> 03:08:06.120 align:start position:0%
are I know but you could save that link
 
03:08:08.670 --> 03:08:08.680 align:start position:0%
and say put it into your own personal
 
03:08:10.550 --> 03:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
calendar oh I see what you're saying put
 
03:08:12.790 --> 03:08:12.800 align:start position:0%
in your calendar not the house calendar
 
03:08:12.800 --> 03:08:13.870 align:start position:0%
in your calendar not the house calendar
yeah

03:08:13.870 --> 03:08:13.880 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:08:16.229 --> 03:08:16.239 align:start position:0%
right that's based on the premise that
 
03:08:18.630 --> 03:08:18.640 align:start position:0%
you keep a calendar on the
 
03:08:18.640 --> 03:08:22.870 align:start position:0%
you keep a calendar on the
computer

03:08:22.870 --> 03:08:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:25.229 --> 03:08:25.239 align:start position:0%
yeah Joe I made a mistake you're
 
03:08:27.910 --> 03:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
actually 40 years um younger than most
 
03:08:31.269 --> 03:08:31.279 align:start position:0%

03:08:34.110 --> 03:08:34.120 align:start position:0%

03:10:08.469 --> 03:10:08.479 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman uh I I believe I recall that
 
03:10:09.750 --> 03:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
there were
 
03:10:11.870 --> 03:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
members uh in the morning session who
 
03:10:14.349 --> 03:10:14.359 align:start position:0%
were expressing interest in subcommittee
 
03:10:17.870 --> 03:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
assignments um yes was
 
03:10:19.990 --> 03:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
could could you to do
 
03:10:22.990 --> 03:10:23.000 align:start position:0%
that yeah well basically uh once You'
 
03:10:26.750 --> 03:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
you know tomorrow once we do uh liquor
 
03:10:26.760 --> 03:10:29.590 align:start position:0%
you know tomorrow once we do uh liquor
and

03:10:29.590 --> 03:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:33.670 --> 03:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
um security but but basically the three
 
03:10:35.750 --> 03:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
divisions are
 
03:10:41.269 --> 03:10:41.279 align:start position:0%
Insurance Banking and um Finance or and
 
03:10:41.279 --> 03:10:42.269 align:start position:0%
Insurance Banking and um Finance or and
and

03:10:42.269 --> 03:10:42.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:10:46.590 --> 03:10:46.600 align:start position:0%
condos and uh and liquor so there are
 
03:10:49.030 --> 03:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
three three standing subcommittees three
 
03:10:51.229 --> 03:10:51.239 align:start position:0%
standing we we call them
 
03:10:53.590 --> 03:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
divisions um even though we're not like
 
03:10:55.550 --> 03:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
finance that has real divisions with
 
03:10:58.389 --> 03:10:58.399 align:start position:0%
real representation but this uh occurred
 
03:11:01.429 --> 03:11:01.439 align:start position:0%
way back when Bill O'Brien was speaker
 
03:11:03.950 --> 03:11:03.960 align:start position:0%
and they threatened to break Commerce up
 
03:11:06.750 --> 03:11:06.760 align:start position:0%
and I I went on Bend and knee and say no
 
03:11:08.990 --> 03:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
no no no no breaking up Commerce we're
 
03:11:11.349 --> 03:11:11.359 align:start position:0%
you know and we can handle all this
 
03:11:13.229 --> 03:11:13.239 align:start position:0%
legislation because there now we we've
 
03:11:14.950 --> 03:11:14.960 align:start position:0%
always been the Lion Share of
 
03:11:16.950 --> 03:11:16.960 align:start position:0%
legislation always close to 10% of all
 
03:11:18.269 --> 03:11:18.279 align:start position:0%
the bills
 
03:11:21.630 --> 03:11:21.640 align:start position:0%
and um so I the my proposal to him was
 
03:11:24.349 --> 03:11:24.359 align:start position:0%
to create these divisions and that that
 
03:11:25.950 --> 03:11:25.960 align:start position:0%
seemed to take the little bit of a
 
03:11:29.870 --> 03:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
pressure off and but um in terms of just
 
03:11:31.389 --> 03:11:31.399 align:start position:0%
my experience and the way I've done
 
03:11:34.510 --> 03:11:34.520 align:start position:0%
things over the years um it would always
 
03:11:37.030 --> 03:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
be kind of a a mishmash when you create
 
03:11:38.870 --> 03:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
up a subcommittee I mean literally would
 
03:11:43.150 --> 03:11:43.160 align:start position:0%
be uh back when when I Leo Frasier was
 
03:11:45.150 --> 03:11:45.160 align:start position:0%
my chairman he would he would just look
 
03:11:47.349 --> 03:11:47.359 align:start position:0%
in the room and look at three people and
 
03:11:49.670 --> 03:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
and picked two Republicans one Democrat
 
03:11:51.469 --> 03:11:51.479 align:start position:0%
and and you know there was a
 
03:11:52.750 --> 03:11:52.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and then there was always a
 
03:11:54.229 --> 03:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
struggle about scheduling the
 
03:11:57.630 --> 03:11:57.640 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and getting things done so
 
03:11:59.590 --> 03:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
um when I came up with this idea of
 
03:12:02.870 --> 03:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
Divisions it just worked really Nifty
 
03:12:05.030 --> 03:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
because we could schedule the all the
 
03:12:06.389 --> 03:12:06.399 align:start position:0%
bill all the bills would go to that
 
03:12:08.510 --> 03:12:08.520 align:start position:0%
division we would schedule it that group
 
03:12:10.229 --> 03:12:10.239 align:start position:0%
of people can come and go in terms of
 
03:12:11.830 --> 03:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
who they were it was bigger than three
 
03:12:13.750 --> 03:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
so you used to have more bodies there
 
03:12:16.190 --> 03:12:16.200 align:start position:0%
and and uh it always seemed to work
 
03:12:18.070 --> 03:12:18.080 align:start position:0%
really well and then
 
03:12:19.630 --> 03:12:19.640 align:start position:0%
out of that subcommittee would come the
 
03:12:20.990 --> 03:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
decision of what we're going to do with
 
03:12:23.269 --> 03:12:23.279 align:start position:0%
the bill so by the time we got to the
 
03:12:25.469 --> 03:12:25.479 align:start position:0%
exec session U for the whole committee
 
03:12:27.910 --> 03:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
to deal with bills unlike other
 
03:12:29.349 --> 03:12:29.359 align:start position:0%
committees which you know which don't
 
03:12:31.750 --> 03:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
get you know a they get a fraction of
 
03:12:33.269 --> 03:12:33.279 align:start position:0%
our bills and when they would kind of
 
03:12:34.830 --> 03:12:34.840 align:start position:0%
struggle it over and sometimes they
 
03:12:36.309 --> 03:12:36.319 align:start position:0%
would then send it to subcommittee or
 
03:12:38.670 --> 03:12:38.680 align:start position:0%
something like that we we could we were
 
03:12:40.910 --> 03:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
very efficient we were we are the model
 
03:12:42.870 --> 03:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
of efficiency when it came to Executive
 
03:12:45.030 --> 03:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
session in terms of going through bills
 
03:12:48.190 --> 03:12:48.200 align:start position:0%
and we've and it seemed to work well so
 
03:12:50.389 --> 03:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
so it do I understand the difference
 
03:12:52.190 --> 03:12:52.200 align:start position:0%
between a division and a subcommittee is
 
03:12:54.670 --> 03:12:54.680 align:start position:0%
that it's less formal no it's the same
 
03:12:56.750 --> 03:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
thing same thing so it's just semantic
 
03:12:58.710 --> 03:12:58.720 align:start position:0%
it's just a different name exactly
 
03:13:00.910 --> 03:13:00.920 align:start position:0%
exactly so actually there there are the
 
03:13:04.590 --> 03:13:04.600 align:start position:0%
divisions are AKA sub subcommitte right
 
03:13:09.229 --> 03:13:09.239 align:start position:0%
but having said that um I I I really
 
03:13:11.229 --> 03:13:11.239 align:start position:0%
will it will
 
03:13:14.389 --> 03:13:14.399 align:start position:0%
be I I think we'll rarely have any of
 
03:13:17.750 --> 03:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
those meetings this this year
 
03:13:19.790 --> 03:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
um next year it'll definitely be the way
 
03:13:22.950 --> 03:13:22.960 align:start position:0%
we do things but at this point I I'm any
 
03:13:24.510 --> 03:13:24.520 align:start position:0%
bill that's really going to need work
 
03:13:27.070 --> 03:13:27.080 align:start position:0%
really need um you know really we're
 
03:13:28.790 --> 03:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
going to talk about it more than then
 
03:13:30.269 --> 03:13:30.279 align:start position:0%
casual you know we all can pretty much
 
03:13:31.990 --> 03:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
get a consensus what we want to do with
 
03:13:36.190 --> 03:13:36.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:40.190 --> 03:13:40.200 align:start position:0%
bill okay uh I I guess I would ask the
 
03:13:42.269 --> 03:13:42.279 align:start position:0%
members of the banking Department to
 
03:13:46.870 --> 03:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
raise their hand so that we can put them
 
03:13:50.309 --> 03:13:50.319 align:start position:0%
up on top of here here we go all right
 
03:13:53.110 --> 03:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
so then I I'm going to promote to
 
03:13:56.349 --> 03:13:56.359 align:start position:0%
panelists right
 
03:14:01.030 --> 03:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
and and just to to mention rep um M Mr
 
03:14:03.429 --> 03:14:03.439 align:start position:0%

03:17:17.269 --> 03:17:17.279 align:start position:0%
Department um is uh fundament Mally
 
03:17:18.790 --> 03:17:18.800 align:start position:0%
different from the Department you heard
 
03:17:20.910 --> 03:17:20.920 align:start position:0%
this morning Department of Insurance um
 
03:17:23.309 --> 03:17:23.319 align:start position:0%
from the get-go um commissioner
 
03:17:25.790 --> 03:17:25.800 align:start position:0%
nicolopoulos told you this morning that
 
03:17:27.550 --> 03:17:27.560 align:start position:0%
when it comes to Insurance all of the
 
03:17:29.510 --> 03:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
regulation happens at the state level
 
03:17:31.790 --> 03:17:31.800 align:start position:0%
there's nobody at the federal level that
 
03:17:34.269 --> 03:17:34.279 align:start position:0%
does quite what they do banks are
 
03:17:36.269 --> 03:17:36.279 align:start position:0%
entirely different we have a dual
 
03:17:38.670 --> 03:17:38.680 align:start position:0%
banking system which means that the
 
03:17:41.030 --> 03:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and you as
 
03:17:45.070 --> 03:17:45.080 align:start position:0%
legislators um Charter and guide
 
03:17:47.030 --> 03:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
depository institutions like Bank Banks
 
03:17:48.269 --> 03:17:48.279 align:start position:0%
and Credit Unions we have state
 
03:17:50.670 --> 03:17:50.680 align:start position:0%
chartered Banks State chartered credit
 
03:17:53.710 --> 03:17:53.720 align:start position:0%
unions and uh State chartered trust
 
03:17:56.790 --> 03:17:56.800 align:start position:0%
companies and at the federal level there
 
03:17:59.110 --> 03:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
is there are competing entities that are
 
03:18:01.750 --> 03:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
federally chartered National Banks and
 
03:18:04.110 --> 03:18:04.120 align:start position:0%
federal trust companies Federal Credit
 
03:18:07.510 --> 03:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
Unions um the other piece of the puzzle
 
03:18:11.590 --> 03:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
are the lenses and at this point in time
 
03:18:14.990 --> 03:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
only States license non-bank
 
03:18:17.189 --> 03:18:17.199 align:start position:0%
non-depository entities like Mortgage
 
03:18:20.750 --> 03:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
Bankers and Brokers um debt adjusters
 
03:18:23.870 --> 03:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
auto finance companies uh and the like
 
03:18:28.309 --> 03:18:28.319 align:start position:0%
there is um a long history of regulatory
 
03:18:31.070 --> 03:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
competition between the states and the
 
03:18:33.030 --> 03:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
federal government when it comes to
 
03:18:35.229 --> 03:18:35.239 align:start position:0%
banking related entities and right now
 
03:18:37.030 --> 03:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
that competition is focused on the
 
03:18:39.389 --> 03:18:39.399 align:start position:0%
licensing side of things where we have
 
03:18:41.269 --> 03:18:41.279 align:start position:0%
both the office of the controller of the
 
03:18:44.150 --> 03:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
currency and the um
 
03:18:47.590 --> 03:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
cfpb um both making efforts to try to
 
03:18:50.429 --> 03:18:50.439 align:start position:0%
become the First Federal agency to
 
03:18:53.790 --> 03:18:53.800 align:start position:0%
license um non-bank providers of
 
03:18:56.229 --> 03:18:56.239 align:start position:0%
products and services the banking
 
03:18:58.469 --> 03:18:58.479 align:start position:0%
Department from a budget point of view
 
03:19:02.750 --> 03:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
is broken into two accounting units um
 
03:19:05.510 --> 03:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
one is for depository
 
03:19:08.150 --> 03:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
institutions um CH excuse me chartered
 
03:19:10.550 --> 03:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
institutions banks credit unions and
 
03:19:13.750 --> 03:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
Trust companies and the other one for
 
03:19:17.229 --> 03:19:17.239 align:start position:0%
lenses um the
 
03:19:20.110 --> 03:19:20.120 align:start position:0%
agency itself does not reflect that
 
03:19:22.030 --> 03:19:22.040 align:start position:0%
other than its budget which as you know
 
03:19:23.510 --> 03:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
all of you can look up on the general
 
03:19:25.349 --> 03:19:25.359 align:start position:0%
court website at this point in time and
 
03:19:28.630 --> 03:19:28.640 align:start position:0%
see what our plans are um when it comes
 
03:19:32.510 --> 03:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
to operations of the department we have
 
03:19:36.429 --> 03:19:36.439 align:start position:0%
54 Personnel so we're a relatively small
 
03:19:39.269 --> 03:19:39.279 align:start position:0%
agency um about eight of those positions
 
03:19:41.950 --> 03:19:41.960 align:start position:0%
are funded but unfilled at this point in
 
03:19:45.469 --> 03:19:45.479 align:start position:0%
time um and we are divided into five
 
03:19:50.110 --> 03:19:50.120 align:start position:0%
divisions um there is a division for
 
03:19:52.070 --> 03:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
bank and credit union supervision a
 
03:19:54.469 --> 03:19:54.479 align:start position:0%
division for Trust Company supervision a
 
03:19:57.910 --> 03:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
division for supervision of lenses again
 
03:20:01.030 --> 03:20:01.040 align:start position:0%
those are um mortgage companies auto
 
03:20:03.910 --> 03:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
finance companies small loan companies
 
03:20:07.030 --> 03:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
uh debt adjusters Etc um there is a
 
03:20:10.150 --> 03:20:10.160 align:start position:0%
division there's a legal division uh and
 
03:20:12.429 --> 03:20:12.439 align:start position:0%
then we have an um Administration a
 
03:20:16.830 --> 03:20:16.840 align:start position:0%
business Division and of all of those 50
 
03:20:19.750 --> 03:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
ish employees more than half of them are
 
03:20:22.150 --> 03:20:22.160 align:start position:0%
over the road staff they're Financial
 
03:20:25.750 --> 03:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
examiners uh and they travel uh
 
03:20:28.349 --> 03:20:28.359 align:start position:0%
generally haven't been doing that uh for
 
03:20:30.510 --> 03:20:30.520 align:start position:0%
the past year obviously um they
 
03:20:33.429 --> 03:20:33.439 align:start position:0%
generally would travel and go to the
 
03:20:35.389 --> 03:20:35.399 align:start position:0%
facility where a bank a credit union a
 
03:20:38.710 --> 03:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
trust company or a mortgage company um
 
03:20:40.469 --> 03:20:40.479 align:start position:0%
or a small loan company is doing
 
03:20:42.309 --> 03:20:42.319 align:start position:0%
business examine their books examine
 
03:20:44.590 --> 03:20:44.600 align:start position:0%
their operations check their compliance
 
03:20:48.150 --> 03:20:48.160 align:start position:0%
um and then file a report uh of that
 
03:20:50.990 --> 03:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
institution we have state statutes um
 
03:20:53.309 --> 03:20:53.319 align:start position:0%
that say that we have to visit and
 
03:20:55.349 --> 03:20:55.359 align:start position:0%
examine and write a report on every
 
03:20:58.429 --> 03:20:58.439 align:start position:0%
single one of the entities that we have
 
03:21:01.870 --> 03:21:01.880 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over once every 18 months
 
03:21:05.630 --> 03:21:05.640 align:start position:0%
there is some um wiggle room in all of
 
03:21:08.389 --> 03:21:08.399 align:start position:0%
that in that we also have the ability to
 
03:21:10.550 --> 03:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
share exams with other states and share
 
03:21:12.349 --> 03:21:12.359 align:start position:0%
exams that were done that are done by
 
03:21:14.469 --> 03:21:14.479 align:start position:0%
the federal government when it comes to
 
03:21:17.389 --> 03:21:17.399 align:start position:0%
banks credit unions um they we all have
 
03:21:19.870 --> 03:21:19.880 align:start position:0%
a primary Federal regulator as well the
 
03:21:23.030 --> 03:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
FDIC for banks the ncua for credit
 
03:21:25.590 --> 03:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
unions and so we can alternate back and
 
03:21:28.309 --> 03:21:28.319 align:start position:0%
forth and do one of their examinations
 
03:21:30.349 --> 03:21:30.359 align:start position:0%
at the state level and accept for the
 
03:21:32.830 --> 03:21:32.840 align:start position:0%
next 18 months examination one done by
 
03:21:36.389 --> 03:21:36.399 align:start position:0%
our by our federal counterpart all of
 
03:21:39.309 --> 03:21:39.319 align:start position:0%
this has really been um an interesting
 
03:21:42.189 --> 03:21:42.199 align:start position:0%
challenge in the era of uh the Corona
 
03:21:46.550 --> 03:21:46.560 align:start position:0%
virus um you're going to hear from our
 
03:21:48.150 --> 03:21:48.160 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner in a little bit and
 
03:21:49.429 --> 03:21:49.439 align:start position:0%
she's going to tell you about some of
 
03:21:51.189 --> 03:21:51.199 align:start position:0%
the things that we've been doing for a
 
03:21:53.990 --> 03:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
while that left us interestingly
 
03:21:56.710 --> 03:21:56.720 align:start position:0%
dramatically prepared seriously prepared
 
03:21:58.870 --> 03:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
for when the pandemic hit it was nothing
 
03:22:02.550 --> 03:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
that we really had anticipated but um
 
03:22:06.229 --> 03:22:06.239 align:start position:0%
through the adoption of um of Technology
 
03:22:08.510 --> 03:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
um and aggressive use uh or trying to
 
03:22:10.030 --> 03:22:10.040 align:start position:0%
apply it to what we do at the bank
 
03:22:12.349 --> 03:22:12.359 align:start position:0%
department for in all honesty to
 
03:22:15.269 --> 03:22:15.279 align:start position:0%
generate um efficiency and effectiveness
 
03:22:18.189 --> 03:22:18.199 align:start position:0%
of Regulation um we found that we were
 
03:22:19.910 --> 03:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
very ready and some of that also had to
 
03:22:22.429 --> 03:22:22.439 align:start position:0%
do with the fact um I hate to admit it
 
03:22:24.670 --> 03:22:24.680 align:start position:0%
but we had an LBA audit and we learned a
 
03:22:27.710 --> 03:22:27.720 align:start position:0%
lot of good stuff about ourselves um and
 
03:22:31.030 --> 03:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
uh as a result we responded to the
 
03:22:33.070 --> 03:22:33.080 align:start position:0%
recommendations that came in the LBA
 
03:22:36.030 --> 03:22:36.040 align:start position:0%
audit um it was ultimately good for us
 
03:22:38.750 --> 03:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
um and um I don't think they knew the
 
03:22:40.309 --> 03:22:40.319 align:start position:0%
Corona virus was coming either but the
 
03:22:43.110 --> 03:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
net result was we were very prepared uh
 
03:22:45.510 --> 03:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
and uh Deputy Commissioner Emilia Galer
 
03:22:49.189 --> 03:22:49.199 align:start position:0%
will tell you about that in a bit um we
 
03:22:55.590 --> 03:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
also um have moved to a very strong um
 
03:22:58.189 --> 03:22:58.199 align:start position:0%
Team centered Focus for operation of the
 
03:23:00.950 --> 03:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
banking Department we have a management
 
03:23:02.670 --> 03:23:02.680 align:start position:0%
team each of the five divisions I've
 
03:23:05.550 --> 03:23:05.560 align:start position:0%
just mentioned to you is run by a
 
03:23:09.349 --> 03:23:09.359 align:start position:0%
division director uh and uh that group
 
03:23:11.150 --> 03:23:11.160 align:start position:0%
get gets together every other Monday
 
03:23:14.229 --> 03:23:14.239 align:start position:0%
morning for often a couple of hours um
 
03:23:15.910 --> 03:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
to discuss where we've been and where
 
03:23:17.229 --> 03:23:17.239 align:start position:0%
we're going
 
03:23:21.630 --> 03:23:21.640 align:start position:0%
uh and uh as a former legislator on
 
03:23:23.870 --> 03:23:23.880 align:start position:0%
myself who was focused on fiscal and
 
03:23:26.469 --> 03:23:26.479 align:start position:0%
finance committies um I recognize the
 
03:23:28.469 --> 03:23:28.479 align:start position:0%
budget is probably one of the primary
 
03:23:30.429 --> 03:23:30.439 align:start position:0%
public policy documents that is going to
 
03:23:33.950 --> 03:23:33.960 align:start position:0%
go through the general court um in any
 
03:23:38.790 --> 03:23:38.800 align:start position:0%
session uh and so um we re we um early
 
03:23:41.670 --> 03:23:41.680 align:start position:0%
on uh when we got our request and
 
03:23:43.990 --> 03:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
directed limits from the governor
 
03:23:45.469 --> 03:23:45.479 align:start position:0%
recognized that this was going to be a
 
03:23:47.189 --> 03:23:47.199 align:start position:0%
different type of year
 
03:23:49.790 --> 03:23:49.800 align:start position:0%
that carried forward into our
 
03:23:51.870 --> 03:23:51.880 align:start position:0%
discussions about how we would approach
 
03:23:54.269 --> 03:23:54.279 align:start position:0%
the legislative session and recognize
 
03:23:56.630 --> 03:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
that we thought that um and from a
 
03:23:58.229 --> 03:23:58.239 align:start position:0%
little bit of intelligence we picked up
 
03:24:00.349 --> 03:24:00.359 align:start position:0%
recognized that as your chairman has
 
03:24:03.189 --> 03:24:03.199 align:start position:0%
recommended or as has told you um it's
 
03:24:04.429 --> 03:24:04.439 align:start position:0%
probably not going to be an a lot an
 
03:24:06.110 --> 03:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
awful lot of subcommittee work going on
 
03:24:09.990 --> 03:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
and that if things are um controversial
 
03:24:11.389 --> 03:24:11.399 align:start position:0%
if they're difficult if it's going to
 
03:24:13.429 --> 03:24:13.439 align:start position:0%
take a lot of wrangling and and working
 
03:24:15.429 --> 03:24:15.439 align:start position:0%
out there's a good chance that
 
03:24:18.349 --> 03:24:18.359 align:start position:0%
legislation will be retained um that was
 
03:24:19.950 --> 03:24:19.960 align:start position:0%
one of the assumptions that we made
 
03:24:22.870 --> 03:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
going into this session and so while
 
03:24:25.389 --> 03:24:25.399 align:start position:0%
Kiara dolino who is our general counsel
 
03:24:27.830 --> 03:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
and will'll be the next to speak to you
 
03:24:29.429 --> 03:24:29.439 align:start position:0%
um we'll talk to you about some
 
03:24:32.469 --> 03:24:32.479 align:start position:0%
legislation she keeps a running list and
 
03:24:35.229 --> 03:24:35.239 align:start position:0%
there are well over a hundred small
 
03:24:38.710 --> 03:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
issues on that list what we try to do is
 
03:24:40.429 --> 03:24:40.439 align:start position:0%
to group things together so that we can
 
03:24:43.870 --> 03:24:43.880 align:start position:0%
bring you a bill that addresses a number
 
03:24:46.790 --> 03:24:46.800 align:start position:0%
of different types of problems and
 
03:24:48.950 --> 03:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
issues this year we decided we were
 
03:24:50.790 --> 03:24:50.800 align:start position:0%
going to try to keep it as small as
 
03:24:52.349 --> 03:24:52.359 align:start position:0%
possible we have two pieces of
 
03:24:54.389 --> 03:24:54.399 align:start position:0%
legislation that we've requested
 
03:24:56.349 --> 03:24:56.359 align:start position:0%
chairman hunt has graciously agreed to
 
03:24:59.269 --> 03:24:59.279 align:start position:0%
be the sponsor of both of them we don't
 
03:25:01.630 --> 03:25:01.640 align:start position:0%
believe there's much of anything uh that
 
03:25:03.910 --> 03:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
is controversial at all in either of
 
03:25:05.830 --> 03:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
those bills and that is by Design
 
03:25:08.349 --> 03:25:08.359 align:start position:0%
because we recognize that you have a lot
 
03:25:10.389 --> 03:25:10.399 align:start position:0%
on your plates we recognize that we're
 
03:25:12.670 --> 03:25:12.680 align:start position:0%
in the age of the Corona virus and it's
 
03:25:16.189 --> 03:25:16.199 align:start position:0%
going to be a different kind of session
 
03:25:19.550 --> 03:25:19.560 align:start position:0%
um one thing we have always done before
 
03:25:22.189 --> 03:25:22.199 align:start position:0%
we bring a piece of legislation forward
 
03:25:24.830 --> 03:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
is draft it as well as we can and then
 
03:25:27.309 --> 03:25:27.319 align:start position:0%
reached out to all of the stakeholders
 
03:25:28.830 --> 03:25:28.840 align:start position:0%
anybody we think that might be
 
03:25:30.950 --> 03:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
interested in this in the piece of
 
03:25:34.750 --> 03:25:34.760 align:start position:0%
legislation and so we start our process
 
03:25:39.590 --> 03:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
um with uh meetings um annually with all
 
03:25:41.510 --> 03:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
of the various trade associations or
 
03:25:44.070 --> 03:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
special interest groups that might have
 
03:25:46.550 --> 03:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
um concern interest input give
 
03:25:48.750 --> 03:25:48.760 align:start position:0%
Assistance or support for pieces of
 
03:25:50.870 --> 03:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
legislation we meet with the credit
 
03:25:52.750 --> 03:25:52.760 align:start position:0%
union Association we meet with the
 
03:25:56.030 --> 03:25:56.040 align:start position:0%
bankers Association we meet with um the
 
03:25:58.389 --> 03:25:58.399 align:start position:0%
uh Auto Dealers Association we meet with
 
03:26:00.790 --> 03:26:00.800 align:start position:0%
the Mortgage Bankers and Brokers um the
 
03:26:02.950 --> 03:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
small loan companies we call them all we
 
03:26:05.590 --> 03:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
send them the draft language we ask for
 
03:26:08.670 --> 03:26:08.680 align:start position:0%
their uh input their thoughts and often
 
03:26:11.229 --> 03:26:11.239 align:start position:0%
they have comments or requests for
 
03:26:15.110 --> 03:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
tweaks um we do our best to facilitate
 
03:26:16.830 --> 03:26:16.840 align:start position:0%
everybody's concerns
 
03:26:19.150 --> 03:26:19.160 align:start position:0%
uh before we even put the legislation
 
03:26:22.269 --> 03:26:22.279 align:start position:0%
before the uh before the lawmakers um
 
03:26:24.070 --> 03:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
that's happened again this year for both
 
03:26:26.630 --> 03:26:26.640 align:start position:0%
of our pieces of of legislation and we
 
03:26:29.150 --> 03:26:29.160 align:start position:0%
are hoping that the net result is that
 
03:26:32.590 --> 03:26:32.600 align:start position:0%
um we have um made your life a little
 
03:26:34.429 --> 03:26:34.439 align:start position:0%
bit easier during this difficult era
 
03:26:36.990 --> 03:26:37.000 align:start position:0%
that we're in at this point in time uh
 
03:26:40.309 --> 03:26:40.319 align:start position:0%
and that um those bills will move
 
03:26:42.309 --> 03:26:42.319 align:start position:0%
through very quickly so this is a good
 
03:26:46.389 --> 03:26:46.399 align:start position:0%
point right now for me to um tell you
 
03:26:48.030 --> 03:26:48.040 align:start position:0%
that the next speaker will be Kiara
 
03:26:50.229 --> 03:26:50.239 align:start position:0%
dolino I don't see her on the screen but
 
03:26:54.070 --> 03:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
I I hope she's on the line or or with us
 
03:26:57.269 --> 03:26:57.279 align:start position:0%
um and uh she will talk about the
 
03:26:58.710 --> 03:26:58.720 align:start position:0%
legislative efforts that we've got
 
03:27:00.950 --> 03:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
coming up before you this year she'll be
 
03:27:04.189 --> 03:27:04.199 align:start position:0%
followed by Emelia garyi who is our
 
03:27:06.309 --> 03:27:06.319 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner and she'll tell you
 
03:27:07.870 --> 03:27:07.880 align:start position:0%
about the sort of things that we're
 
03:27:11.189 --> 03:27:11.199 align:start position:0%
looking at in the future so with that um
 
03:27:14.110 --> 03:27:14.120 align:start position:0%

today hello how are you put your video
 
03:27:43.990 --> 03:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
on oh you know I have a problem with my
 
03:27:46.349 --> 03:27:46.359 align:start position:0%
internet connectivity and I am just keep
 
03:27:48.110 --> 03:27:48.120 align:start position:0%
my fingers crossed I don't get kicked
 
03:27:51.910 --> 03:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
off um the system so I unfortunately I
 
03:27:53.830 --> 03:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
can't put them on my video I do have my
 
03:27:56.670 --> 03:27:56.680 align:start position:0%
phone on in case I drop off I will pick
 
03:27:58.830 --> 03:27:58.840 align:start position:0%
up my phone and and continue speaking
 
03:28:01.950 --> 03:28:01.960 align:start position:0%
through my phone link so thank you for
 
03:28:05.389 --> 03:28:05.399 align:start position:0%
your patience um so yes we do have two
 
03:28:07.550 --> 03:28:07.560 align:start position:0%
bills um one is a fiscal what we call
 
03:28:10.150 --> 03:28:10.160 align:start position:0%
our fiscal efficiency bill which is LSR
 
03:28:10.160 --> 03:28:12.750 align:start position:0%
our fiscal efficiency bill which is LSR
2021

03:28:12.750 --> 03:28:12.760 align:start position:0%
2021
 
03:28:15.349 --> 03:28:15.359 align:start position:0%
0545 um and this bill accomplishes
 
03:28:18.429 --> 03:28:18.439 align:start position:0%
another number of important objectives
 
03:28:21.110 --> 03:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
primarily aimed at reducing costs and
 
03:28:22.550 --> 03:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
becoming more
 
03:28:25.870 --> 03:28:25.880 align:start position:0%
efficient so uh the first change we're
 
03:28:29.510 --> 03:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
requesting is for our licensed entities
 
03:28:32.110 --> 03:28:32.120 align:start position:0%
uh which include retail sellers sales
 
03:28:35.670 --> 03:28:35.680 align:start position:0%
finance companies that do auto loans um
 
03:28:38.150 --> 03:28:38.160 align:start position:0%
small L small loan lenders debt
 
03:28:40.750 --> 03:28:40.760 align:start position:0%
adjusters and money transmitters we're
 
03:28:43.150 --> 03:28:43.160 align:start position:0%
seeking to have all those folks licensed
 
03:28:46.269 --> 03:28:46.279 align:start position:0%
through the nmls system which is an
 
03:28:50.189 --> 03:28:50.199 align:start position:0%
ronic licensing uh system uh this is a
 
03:28:52.710 --> 03:28:52.720 align:start position:0%
much more efficient method for us and
 
03:28:56.550 --> 03:28:56.560 align:start position:0%
for the lenes um currently we maintain
 
03:29:00.189 --> 03:29:00.199 align:start position:0%
two separate licensing systems which is
 
03:29:02.309 --> 03:29:02.319 align:start position:0%
obviously less efficient than using a
 
03:29:04.269 --> 03:29:04.279 align:start position:0%
single system so we're seeking to have
 
03:29:07.269 --> 03:29:07.279 align:start position:0%
everyone transition to this electronic
 
03:29:11.070 --> 03:29:11.080 align:start position:0%
system um we did attempt um a first step
 
03:29:13.070 --> 03:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
in making this happen last session in
 
03:29:13.080 --> 03:29:14.110 align:start position:0%
in making this happen last session in
hb1

03:29:14.110 --> 03:29:14.120 align:start position:0%
hb1
 
03:29:16.750 --> 03:29:16.760 align:start position:0%
1437 for our money transmitters but
 
03:29:18.990 --> 03:29:19.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the bill got caught up
 
03:29:21.070 --> 03:29:21.080 align:start position:0%
with all the covid related um
 
03:29:23.550 --> 03:29:23.560 align:start position:0%
difficulties and was vetoed by the
 
03:29:27.429 --> 03:29:27.439 align:start position:0%
governor um we also are seeking to have
 
03:29:30.790 --> 03:29:30.800 align:start position:0%
a change in regard to our trust
 
03:29:33.070 --> 03:29:33.080 align:start position:0%
companies uh last session there was a
 
03:29:36.189 --> 03:29:36.199 align:start position:0%
bill put forward HB
 
03:29:39.550 --> 03:29:39.560 align:start position:0%
1645 to allow us to conduct background
 
03:29:42.710 --> 03:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
investigations for the new directors
 
03:29:45.309 --> 03:29:45.319 align:start position:0%
appointed to trust companies so this
 
03:29:48.990 --> 03:29:49.000 align:start position:0%
bill um um is again um that bill brought
 
03:29:52.229 --> 03:29:52.239 align:start position:0%
forward a second time um and the fiscal
 
03:29:54.150 --> 03:29:54.160 align:start position:0%
impact of this is that the cost for
 
03:29:55.950 --> 03:29:55.960 align:start position:0%
conducting those investigations would be
 
03:29:59.790 --> 03:29:59.800 align:start position:0%
borne by the trust companies
 
03:30:02.030 --> 03:30:02.040 align:start position:0%
themselves in addition it allows the
 
03:30:03.910 --> 03:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
direct excuse me the commissioner to
 
03:30:06.070 --> 03:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
remove an officer or director if they
 
03:30:09.750 --> 03:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
are shown to be um unqualified to
 
03:30:13.070 --> 03:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
serve we were also seeking to have um
 
03:30:16.590 --> 03:30:16.600 align:start position:0%
again in regard to last sessions hb6
 
03:30:19.429 --> 03:30:19.439 align:start position:0%
1995 we're looking to have um the
 
03:30:21.790 --> 03:30:21.800 align:start position:0%
ability to charge our chartered
 
03:30:24.070 --> 03:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
institutions for their
 
03:30:27.030 --> 03:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
applications um when those applications
 
03:30:28.870 --> 03:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
come in and are very complex we're
 
03:30:30.750 --> 03:30:30.760 align:start position:0%
seeking to have the ability to charge
 
03:30:33.830 --> 03:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
more for those applications and also
 
03:30:36.469 --> 03:30:36.479 align:start position:0%
increasing the charge for applications
 
03:30:41.189 --> 03:30:41.199 align:start position:0%
filed for new institutions seeking to be
 
03:30:44.070 --> 03:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
chartered um we're requesting
 
03:30:46.150 --> 03:30:46.160 align:start position:0%
clarification uh for the right of the
 
03:30:49.110 --> 03:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
department to charge companies that are
 
03:30:50.910 --> 03:30:50.920 align:start position:0%
chartered by the department and then
 
03:30:53.950 --> 03:30:53.960 align:start position:0%
either are dissolving or transitioning
 
03:30:56.550 --> 03:30:56.560 align:start position:0%
to a federal Charter to pay their share
 
03:30:59.269 --> 03:30:59.279 align:start position:0%
of the assessment if their dissolution
 
03:31:01.229 --> 03:31:01.239 align:start position:0%
or their conversion to Federal Charter
 
03:31:04.309 --> 03:31:04.319 align:start position:0%
happens sort of midye and we haven't yet
 
03:31:06.429 --> 03:31:06.439 align:start position:0%
invoiced uh currently some of those
 
03:31:09.550 --> 03:31:09.560 align:start position:0%
costs uh if we don't um make
 
03:31:11.150 --> 03:31:11.160 align:start position:0%
arrangements with the company to pay
 
03:31:14.150 --> 03:31:14.160 align:start position:0%
those charges those get shifted to um
 
03:31:16.150 --> 03:31:16.160 align:start position:0%
all the institutions through the assess
 
03:31:18.710 --> 03:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
so we're seeking to adjust that
 
03:31:22.189 --> 03:31:22.199 align:start position:0%
payment uh we're also requesting that um
 
03:31:25.429 --> 03:31:25.439 align:start position:0%
minimum interest rates for uh charges uh
 
03:31:27.990 --> 03:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
for interest rates charged when are paid
 
03:31:30.790 --> 03:31:30.800 align:start position:0%
when uh institutions have escrow
 
03:31:34.670 --> 03:31:34.680 align:start position:0%
accounts for both tax and premium uh
 
03:31:36.630 --> 03:31:36.640 align:start position:0%
interest uh pre insurance premium
 
03:31:38.910 --> 03:31:38.920 align:start position:0%
payments uh that that interest rate be
 
03:31:40.750 --> 03:31:40.760 align:start position:0%
set according to the Federal Open
 
03:31:43.269 --> 03:31:43.279 align:start position:0%
markets committee federal funds interest
 
03:31:45.630 --> 03:31:45.640 align:start position:0%
rate currently we calculate those rates
 
03:31:48.150 --> 03:31:48.160 align:start position:0%
by asking our various institutions to
 
03:31:50.830 --> 03:31:50.840 align:start position:0%
report their interest rates to us and we
 
03:31:52.750 --> 03:31:52.760 align:start position:0%
we come up with that formula and we
 
03:31:54.550 --> 03:31:54.560 align:start position:0%
report to them every year what they can
 
03:31:56.870 --> 03:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
charge this way it would be become more
 
03:31:59.590 --> 03:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
automatic and much more seamless um and
 
03:31:59.600 --> 03:32:00.550 align:start position:0%
automatic and much more seamless um and
more

03:32:00.550 --> 03:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
more
 
03:32:03.830 --> 03:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
efficient and then finally uh also again
 
03:32:06.830 --> 03:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
requested last session in hb1 1437 but
 
03:32:09.150 --> 03:32:09.160 align:start position:0%
unfortunately did not pass uh did not
 
03:32:11.030 --> 03:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
get uh put into law because it was
 
03:32:13.950 --> 03:32:13.960 align:start position:0%
vetoed we're asking to have our consumer
 
03:32:16.389 --> 03:32:16.399 align:start position:0%
complaints transmitted by email rather
 
03:32:18.550 --> 03:32:18.560 align:start position:0%
than by certified mail currently we have
 
03:32:21.229 --> 03:32:21.239 align:start position:0%
to send by certified mail that requires
 
03:32:23.229 --> 03:32:23.239 align:start position:0%
copying costs and certified mailing
 
03:32:25.590 --> 03:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
costs and it's slower we're seeking to
 
03:32:27.550 --> 03:32:27.560 align:start position:0%
have a change so that we can send those
 
03:32:27.560 --> 03:32:28.910 align:start position:0%
have a change so that we can send those
by

03:32:28.910 --> 03:32:28.920 align:start position:0%
by
 
03:32:31.389 --> 03:32:31.399 align:start position:0%
email so those are all the the changes
 
03:32:33.150 --> 03:32:33.160 align:start position:0%
that we requesting that have a fiscal
 
03:32:38.150 --> 03:32:38.160 align:start position:0%
impact and are part of um LSR 2021
 
03:32:42.550 --> 03:32:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:46.110 --> 03:32:46.120 align:start position:0%
questions okay great um the next next
 
03:32:48.510 --> 03:32:48.520 align:start position:0%
bill is what we call our clarifications
 
03:32:52.070 --> 03:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
bill which is LSR 2021 054 we do have a
 
03:32:54.309 --> 03:32:54.319 align:start position:0%
question uh Chris Herbert hand up sorry
 
03:33:02.309 --> 03:33:02.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:04.870 --> 03:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
Chris you're still oh you took his hand
 
03:33:07.389 --> 03:33:07.399 align:start position:0%
down and you're muted Chris so I can't
 
03:33:09.349 --> 03:33:09.359 align:start position:0%
hear what you're telling okay I want to
 
03:33:12.590 --> 03:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
come through John uh the chairman if I
 
03:33:16.790 --> 03:33:16.800 align:start position:0%
may uh to help me out here
 
03:33:19.309 --> 03:33:19.319 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm interested I know I thought that
 
03:33:21.870 --> 03:33:21.880 align:start position:0%
the uh the trust companies you know to
 
03:33:25.630 --> 03:33:25.640 align:start position:0%
be uh pay for our charges for checking
 
03:33:27.070 --> 03:33:27.080 align:start position:0%
things out with them and that sort of
 
03:33:28.750 --> 03:33:28.760 align:start position:0%
thing I thought that went through the
 
03:33:31.950 --> 03:33:31.960 align:start position:0%
committee fairly easily and so I'm I'm
 
03:33:33.790 --> 03:33:33.800 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering
 
03:33:36.670 --> 03:33:36.680 align:start position:0%
why was this did we did all these things
 
03:33:39.349 --> 03:33:39.359 align:start position:0%
just get bollocked up in well we had a
 
03:33:42.469 --> 03:33:42.479 align:start position:0%
study committee and which Tina was on
 
03:33:44.429 --> 03:33:44.439 align:start position:0%
and uh on the trust you know the trust
 
03:33:46.269 --> 03:33:46.279 align:start position:0%
statue and this was the stuff that came
 
03:33:49.950 --> 03:33:49.960 align:start position:0%
out of that that study committee but um
 
03:33:53.389 --> 03:33:53.399 align:start position:0%
did remember what happened
 
03:33:55.750 --> 03:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
why do Jerry do you remember why you got
 
03:34:00.110 --> 03:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
vetoed if I if I might U Mr chairman
 
03:34:02.910 --> 03:34:02.920 align:start position:0%
um the banking Department submissions to
 
03:34:05.110 --> 03:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
that bill were not the reason for the
 
03:34:08.550 --> 03:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
Governor's veto as a matter of fact um
 
03:34:11.229 --> 03:34:11.239 align:start position:0%
it was part of the Christmas tree uh it
 
03:34:14.710 --> 03:34:14.720 align:start position:0%
was a it was um a piece of legislation
 
03:34:17.510 --> 03:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
that received no opposition in either
 
03:34:19.389 --> 03:34:19.399 align:start position:0%
the house or Senate and moved through
 
03:34:21.229 --> 03:34:21.239 align:start position:0%
very nicely because it had actually much
 
03:34:25.349 --> 03:34:25.359 align:start position:0%
of it had had spun from a bill in
 
03:34:27.510 --> 03:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
2019 and a study committee that
 
03:34:30.150 --> 03:34:30.160 align:start position:0%
recommended all of these things happen
 
03:34:32.429 --> 03:34:32.439 align:start position:0%
and so it moved forward pretty easily
 
03:34:35.110 --> 03:34:35.120 align:start position:0%
last year um and was considered to be a
 
03:34:36.870 --> 03:34:36.880 align:start position:0%
good piece of legislation people wanted
 
03:34:38.510 --> 03:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
to pass but it was part of the Christmas
 
03:34:40.389 --> 03:34:40.399 align:start position:0%
tree the governor vetoed for other
 
03:34:43.309 --> 03:34:43.319 align:start position:0%
reasons not the banking Department um
 
03:34:45.830 --> 03:34:45.840 align:start position:0%
requested legislation
 
03:34:48.590 --> 03:34:48.600 align:start position:0%
okay CU I was a little surprised to hear
 
03:34:51.990 --> 03:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
this uh because it sailed through
 
03:34:54.510 --> 03:34:54.520 align:start position:0%
Commerce exactly and remember the last
 
03:34:56.990 --> 03:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
session this the Senate you know started
 
03:34:59.150 --> 03:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
combining bills and getting crazy with
 
03:35:01.510 --> 03:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
putting bills together can never trust
 
03:35:01.520 --> 03:35:04.790 align:start position:0%
putting bills together can never trust
those

03:35:04.790 --> 03:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:07.510 --> 03:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
Senators so anyway yes so it is the same
 
03:35:09.790 --> 03:35:09.800 align:start position:0%
issue the same bill and and should
 
03:35:11.630 --> 03:35:11.640 align:start position:0%
should be we shouldn't have any trouble
 
03:35:17.269 --> 03:35:17.279 align:start position:0%
with this yes John um 210 545 has not
 
03:35:19.910 --> 03:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
become a house bill yet it's still in
 
03:35:19.920 --> 03:35:21.229 align:start position:0%
become a house bill yet it's still in
LSR

03:35:21.229 --> 03:35:21.239 align:start position:0%
LSR
 
03:35:24.070 --> 03:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
form I got it up on my other computer
 
03:35:27.710 --> 03:35:27.720 align:start position:0%
all right stay tuned all right I guess
 
03:35:32.110 --> 03:35:32.120 align:start position:0%
we're all set so thank you thank you K
 
03:35:34.389 --> 03:35:34.399 align:start position:0%
so the the second bill um is our
 
03:35:36.469 --> 03:35:36.479 align:start position:0%
clarifications bill I I only have the
 
03:35:38.229 --> 03:35:38.239 align:start position:0%
LSR number I don't know if this became a
 
03:35:41.630 --> 03:35:41.640 align:start position:0%
house bill yet but it's LSR 2021
 
03:35:46.630 --> 03:35:46.640 align:start position:0%
0548 0548 hang on
 
03:35:48.710 --> 03:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
keep going keep going okay I'll keep
 
03:35:52.510 --> 03:35:52.520 align:start position:0%
going um so this bill is really um sort
 
03:35:54.349 --> 03:35:54.359 align:start position:0%
of a technical bill it's making some
 
03:35:56.630 --> 03:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
clarifications and again nothing that we
 
03:35:58.469 --> 03:35:58.479 align:start position:0%
think is is
 
03:36:00.950 --> 03:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
controversial um first we're trying to
 
03:36:04.070 --> 03:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
clarify deadlines that apply when we
 
03:36:07.150 --> 03:36:07.160 align:start position:0%
examine our Consumer Credit licensees
 
03:36:09.070 --> 03:36:09.080 align:start position:0%
the current statutory language is
 
03:36:12.110 --> 03:36:12.120 align:start position:0%
somewhat confusing um so we are looking
 
03:36:14.229 --> 03:36:14.239 align:start position:0%
to clarify those deadlines and give a
 
03:36:16.950 --> 03:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
little more time so that lenses can pull
 
03:36:18.870 --> 03:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
together the records that they need for
 
03:36:22.229 --> 03:36:22.239 align:start position:0%
us we're also um requesting a covid
 
03:36:23.670 --> 03:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
related um
 
03:36:25.990 --> 03:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
clarification we currently have a lot of
 
03:36:28.110 --> 03:36:28.120 align:start position:0%
our mortgage loan Originators who are
 
03:36:30.670 --> 03:36:30.680 align:start position:0%
teleworking from their homes under
 
03:36:33.389 --> 03:36:33.399 align:start position:0%
current law it could require them to be
 
03:36:36.429 --> 03:36:36.439 align:start position:0%
licensed in that quote Home State even
 
03:36:37.990 --> 03:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
if they're not doing any business in
 
03:36:39.750 --> 03:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
that state for example if they're living
 
03:36:42.469 --> 03:36:42.479 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts but working with only
 
03:36:44.710 --> 03:36:44.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire consumers so we're seeking
 
03:36:46.910 --> 03:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
some clarification to allow them to work
 
03:36:49.269 --> 03:36:49.279 align:start position:0%
without having to get an unnecessary
 
03:36:52.229 --> 03:36:52.239 align:start position:0%
license we're looking to clarify that
 
03:36:54.389 --> 03:36:54.399 align:start position:0%
trust companies um Family Trust
 
03:36:56.269 --> 03:36:56.279 align:start position:0%
companies can be examined more
 
03:36:58.950 --> 03:36:58.960 align:start position:0%
frequently if necessary we believe we
 
03:37:00.630 --> 03:37:00.640 align:start position:0%
have this Authority now but we're just
 
03:37:02.910 --> 03:37:02.920 align:start position:0%
seeking to adjust the language and the
 
03:37:05.309 --> 03:37:05.319 align:start position:0%
statute so that it's comparable to all
 
03:37:07.510 --> 03:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
other exam Provisions for all other
 
03:37:07.520 --> 03:37:09.030 align:start position:0%
other exam Provisions for all other
examed

03:37:09.030 --> 03:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
examed
 
03:37:11.790 --> 03:37:11.800 align:start position:0%
entities um we're clarifying that a
 
03:37:14.910 --> 03:37:14.920 align:start position:0%
depository Bank can be a benefit
 
03:37:17.189 --> 03:37:17.199 align:start position:0%
Corporation under
 
03:37:19.750 --> 03:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
293c we've approved this already we
 
03:37:21.710 --> 03:37:21.720 align:start position:0%
think this is already permissible but we
 
03:37:23.389 --> 03:37:23.399 align:start position:0%
want to put something in the statutes
 
03:37:24.710 --> 03:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
just to
 
03:37:27.550 --> 03:37:27.560 align:start position:0%
clarify uh we're looking to clarify
 
03:37:29.990 --> 03:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
requirements applicable to Credit Union
 
03:37:34.870 --> 03:37:34.880 align:start position:0%
boards um having delegation to um boards
 
03:37:37.110 --> 03:37:37.120 align:start position:0%
um and in credit unions and just
 
03:37:38.469 --> 03:37:38.479 align:start position:0%
clarifying that they have to keep
 
03:37:38.479 --> 03:37:40.070 align:start position:0%
clarifying that they have to keep
minutes

03:37:40.070 --> 03:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
03:37:42.990 --> 03:37:43.000 align:start position:0%
Etc and finally we're looking uh to
 
03:37:44.710 --> 03:37:44.720 align:start position:0%
adjust the restrictions that apply to
 
03:37:46.630 --> 03:37:46.640 align:start position:0%
the commissioner Deputy Commissioner for
 
03:37:48.389 --> 03:37:48.399 align:start position:0%
the types of personal loans they can
 
03:37:50.870 --> 03:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
have again this was a bill that came
 
03:37:53.030 --> 03:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
forward last session HB
 
03:37:55.710 --> 03:37:55.720 align:start position:0%
1437 and as um commissioner little
 
03:37:58.229 --> 03:37:58.239 align:start position:0%
mentioned it got caught up in the
 
03:38:00.510 --> 03:38:00.520 align:start position:0%
Omnibus christm tree bills that were
 
03:38:02.830 --> 03:38:02.840 align:start position:0%
veto by the governor so again we think
 
03:38:04.630 --> 03:38:04.640 align:start position:0%
all these Provisions are very reasonable
 
03:38:07.910 --> 03:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
and we don't expect any any
 
03:38:10.910 --> 03:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
opposition great yes so representative
 
03:38:16.550 --> 03:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
pusk has a question uh LSR 0540 is now
 
03:38:16.560 --> 03:38:18.710 align:start position:0%

03:39:28.550 --> 03:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
she's going to take the final portion of
 
03:39:30.429 --> 03:39:30.439 align:start position:0%
our presentation this
 
03:39:33.710 --> 03:39:33.720 align:start position:0%
afternoon okay sounds good I don't know
 
03:39:35.070 --> 03:39:35.080 align:start position:0%
if I've ever been called The Secret
 
03:39:37.469 --> 03:39:37.479 align:start position:0%
Sauce before so I'll take
 
03:39:40.950 --> 03:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
it um good afternoon uh as commissioner
 
03:39:43.309 --> 03:39:43.319 align:start position:0%
said my name is Amelia Galder and I am
 
03:39:45.429 --> 03:39:45.439 align:start position:0%
the Deputy Commissioner at the new
 
03:39:47.189 --> 03:39:47.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire banking Department I've been
 
03:39:49.429 --> 03:39:49.439 align:start position:0%
at the banking department for I think
 
03:39:53.030 --> 03:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
nine years now um I started as a
 
03:39:54.510 --> 03:39:54.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement attorney in the legal
 
03:39:57.030 --> 03:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
Division and moved up to general counsel
 
03:39:59.030 --> 03:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
um when I was General Counsel I was um
 
03:40:01.510 --> 03:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
the legislative liaison um so I did
 
03:40:03.670 --> 03:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
appear before house Commerce um quite
 
03:40:05.990 --> 03:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
frequently at that time um and then I
 
03:40:08.990 --> 03:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
moved on to become Deputy um so
 
03:40:11.349 --> 03:40:11.359 align:start position:0%
commissioner little asked me to give you
 
03:40:14.670 --> 03:40:14.680 align:start position:0%
an update about um where the banking
 
03:40:17.590 --> 03:40:17.600 align:start position:0%
Department or what we've been up to and
 
03:40:20.550 --> 03:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
um where the banking department is going
 
03:40:23.750 --> 03:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
um so I'll go ahead and get to that um
 
03:40:25.790 --> 03:40:25.800 align:start position:0%
basically if I could sum it all up in
 
03:40:27.469 --> 03:40:27.479 align:start position:0%
one sentence it would be you know the
 
03:40:29.389 --> 03:40:29.399 align:start position:0%
Department's been trying to leverage
 
03:40:32.510 --> 03:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
technology um to create efficiencies and
 
03:40:34.229 --> 03:40:34.239 align:start position:0%
um to continue to build on what we've
 
03:40:36.710 --> 03:40:36.720 align:start position:0%
accomplished over the years um this
 
03:40:39.670 --> 03:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
whole process began a few years ago um
 
03:40:41.030 --> 03:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
really back in
 
03:40:44.269 --> 03:40:44.279 align:start position:0%
2017 um at the department we began um a
 
03:40:46.910 --> 03:40:46.920 align:start position:0%
big push to really document our policies
 
03:40:49.070 --> 03:40:49.080 align:start position:0%
and procedures and get our our ducks in
 
03:40:51.910 --> 03:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
a row so to speak um one of the first
 
03:40:53.389 --> 03:40:53.399 align:start position:0%
policies and procedures that we
 
03:40:55.790 --> 03:40:55.800 align:start position:0%
documented somewhat fortuitously it it
 
03:40:57.950 --> 03:40:57.960 align:start position:0%
sounds like very strange when I'm
 
03:40:59.070 --> 03:40:59.080 align:start position:0%
talking about this now but one of the
 
03:41:01.110 --> 03:41:01.120 align:start position:0%
first policies that we did document was
 
03:41:03.990 --> 03:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
a Tork policy um back in
 
03:41:07.469 --> 03:41:07.479 align:start position:0%
2017 um so basically the department um
 
03:41:10.309 --> 03:41:10.319 align:start position:0%
again fortuitously has been um is
 
03:41:12.429 --> 03:41:12.439 align:start position:0%
familiar with uh teleworking we've been
 
03:41:14.790 --> 03:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
telea workking on and off um with more
 
03:41:16.590 --> 03:41:16.600 align:start position:0%
limitation obviously than we currently
 
03:41:20.910 --> 03:41:20.920 align:start position:0%
are in the pandemic um but um currently
 
03:41:22.870 --> 03:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
um you know that was a fortuitous
 
03:41:25.269 --> 03:41:25.279 align:start position:0%
development um so then in
 
03:41:28.950 --> 03:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
2019 um we instituted a new timekeeping
 
03:41:32.189 --> 03:41:32.199 align:start position:0%
system um previous to our new
 
03:41:34.229 --> 03:41:34.239 align:start position:0%
timekeeping system we had about three
 
03:41:36.269 --> 03:41:36.279 align:start position:0%
systems that people had to input their
 
03:41:38.870 --> 03:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
time into to track um for billing
 
03:41:41.309 --> 03:41:41.319 align:start position:0%
purposes for um how we Bill our entities
 
03:41:43.309 --> 03:41:43.319 align:start position:0%
for the examinations that we do to fund
 
03:41:44.910 --> 03:41:44.920 align:start position:0%
the department and that was obviously
 
03:41:47.229 --> 03:41:47.239 align:start position:0%
quite labor intensive um we combine
 
03:41:50.710 --> 03:41:50.720 align:start position:0%
those all into one system um and um that
 
03:41:52.910 --> 03:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
system has really created a lot of data
 
03:41:56.309 --> 03:41:56.319 align:start position:0%
that we can use to um um further
 
03:41:58.710 --> 03:41:58.720 align:start position:0%
understand our operations and um monitor
 
03:42:00.910 --> 03:42:00.920 align:start position:0%
efficiencies and effectiveness of the
 
03:42:04.950 --> 03:42:04.960 align:start position:0%
department um in 2020 we um undertook an
 
03:42:07.950 --> 03:42:07.960 align:start position:0%
update to our strategic plan um and
 
03:42:10.349 --> 03:42:10.359 align:start position:0%
again the our focus in updating the
 
03:42:13.990 --> 03:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
Strategic plan was really to rely um on
 
03:42:16.110 --> 03:42:16.120 align:start position:0%
evidence-based uh
 
03:42:18.830 --> 03:42:18.840 align:start position:0%
practice um and use appropriate metrics
 
03:42:20.990 --> 03:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
to measure our accomplishments um
 
03:42:24.670 --> 03:42:24.680 align:start position:0%
related to the Strategic plan uh again
 
03:42:29.070 --> 03:42:29.080 align:start position:0%
in 2020 um right as the pandemic hit um
 
03:42:31.830 --> 03:42:31.840 align:start position:0%
in about about April we finalized our
 
03:42:35.469 --> 03:42:35.479 align:start position:0%
continuity of operations plan um so that
 
03:42:38.550 --> 03:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
was a about a two-year undertaking um
 
03:42:41.710 --> 03:42:41.720 align:start position:0%
with a focus on again um somewhat
 
03:42:44.670 --> 03:42:44.680 align:start position:0%
fortuitously um teleworking so our plan
 
03:42:47.469 --> 03:42:47.479 align:start position:0%
all along in the event of a continuity
 
03:42:51.149 --> 03:42:51.159 align:start position:0%
um situation was to have our folks Tork
 
03:42:53.510 --> 03:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
so starting two years ago we began to
 
03:42:56.590 --> 03:42:56.600 align:start position:0%
slowly Implement that so that
 
03:42:59.830 --> 03:42:59.840 align:start position:0%
um the first week of the pandemic in
 
03:43:01.710 --> 03:43:01.720 align:start position:0%
about mid-march when the governor gave
 
03:43:02.910 --> 03:43:02.920 align:start position:0%
us the directive to all start
 
03:43:05.030 --> 03:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
teleworking that was the week that the
 
03:43:07.189 --> 03:43:07.199 align:start position:0%
last person at the department got a
 
03:43:09.990 --> 03:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
laptop so that very week we all had
 
03:43:12.510 --> 03:43:12.520 align:start position:0%
laptops we were all ready to go um we
 
03:43:15.630 --> 03:43:15.640 align:start position:0%
were extraordinarily lucky um that that
 
03:43:18.590 --> 03:43:18.600 align:start position:0%
happened so we've uh been comfortably uh
 
03:43:21.030 --> 03:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
teleworking ever since um we were one of
 
03:43:23.429 --> 03:43:23.439 align:start position:0%
the first agencies to do that I think
 
03:43:27.229 --> 03:43:27.239 align:start position:0%
and um we're quite proud of that um
 
03:43:29.429 --> 03:43:29.439 align:start position:0%
finally like the the most recent kind of
 
03:43:30.670 --> 03:43:30.680 align:start position:0%
big accomplishment which actually
 
03:43:33.870 --> 03:43:33.880 align:start position:0%
happened last week on January 4th was we
 
03:43:36.830 --> 03:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
um update we created a a unified
 
03:43:40.830 --> 03:43:40.840 align:start position:0%
database system for the department so um
 
03:43:43.550 --> 03:43:43.560 align:start position:0%
prior to the start of this new database
 
03:43:45.630 --> 03:43:45.640 align:start position:0%
we had about 10
 
03:43:47.349 --> 03:43:47.359 align:start position:0%
um for the computer nerds out there
 
03:43:50.910 --> 03:43:50.920 align:start position:0%
access 1997 databases um that we were
 
03:43:54.030 --> 03:43:54.040 align:start position:0%
operating about two years ago um
 
03:43:55.670 --> 03:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
starting two years ago we started this
 
03:43:56.750 --> 03:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
process of updating them and
 
03:43:59.990 --> 03:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
consolidating them so um as of January
 
03:44:02.550 --> 03:44:02.560 align:start position:0%
4th we had taken about six of those 10
 
03:44:04.950 --> 03:44:04.960 align:start position:0%
and have Consolidated them into one
 
03:44:08.309 --> 03:44:08.319 align:start position:0%
database with modern technology um that
 
03:44:10.229 --> 03:44:10.239 align:start position:0%
complements our timekeeping system so it
 
03:44:12.870 --> 03:44:12.880 align:start position:0%
all sort of works together um and as you
 
03:44:15.429 --> 03:44:15.439 align:start position:0%
might imagine that's generated um of
 
03:44:17.429 --> 03:44:17.439 align:start position:0%
efficiency um obviously we're still kind
 
03:44:19.349 --> 03:44:19.359 align:start position:0%
of working through the hiccups of having
 
03:44:22.349 --> 03:44:22.359 align:start position:0%
a new database as of January 4th um but
 
03:44:25.269 --> 03:44:25.279 align:start position:0%
overall um it's all going very well and
 
03:44:26.750 --> 03:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
I apologize if you just heard that my
 
03:44:30.349 --> 03:44:30.359 align:start position:0%
dog walked down the stairs and barked I
 
03:44:34.189 --> 03:44:34.199 align:start position:0%
apologize always happens um so um that's
 
03:44:37.630 --> 03:44:37.640 align:start position:0%
kind of what we've been up to um and um
 
03:44:40.469 --> 03:44:40.479 align:start position:0%
where we're going now is um we are
 
03:44:42.389 --> 03:44:42.399 align:start position:0%
obviously um have been pretty
 
03:44:44.110 --> 03:44:44.120 align:start position:0%
extensively leveraging telea workk
 
03:44:45.790 --> 03:44:45.800 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic
 
03:44:49.830 --> 03:44:49.840 align:start position:0%
and um in monitoring different metrics
 
03:44:52.269 --> 03:44:52.279 align:start position:0%
um we found that that's create um
 
03:44:54.149 --> 03:44:54.159 align:start position:0%
created a great deal of efficiency at
 
03:44:57.630 --> 03:44:57.640 align:start position:0%
the department um so for example we just
 
03:45:01.389 --> 03:45:01.399 align:start position:0%
calculated our 2020 assessment which is
 
03:45:03.830 --> 03:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
um to the extent that we don't recoup
 
03:45:07.750 --> 03:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
our expenses um we Bill our chartered
 
03:45:10.670 --> 03:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
entities for cost associated with their
 
03:45:13.630 --> 03:45:13.640 align:start position:0%
regulation um and that uh the 2020
 
03:45:16.429 --> 03:45:16.439 align:start position:0%
assessment actually went down by 30% as
 
03:45:19.030 --> 03:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
compared to last year um and we were
 
03:45:22.830 --> 03:45:22.840 align:start position:0%
able to pinpoint um what that was due to
 
03:45:24.870 --> 03:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
um and we found that we were able while
 
03:45:26.990 --> 03:45:27.000 align:start position:0%
telea workking we were able to do more
 
03:45:30.110 --> 03:45:30.120 align:start position:0%
examinations so that increased Revenue
 
03:45:32.550 --> 03:45:32.560 align:start position:0%
um while at the same time we had less um
 
03:45:34.950 --> 03:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
expenses because we weren't traveling as
 
03:45:37.790 --> 03:45:37.800 align:start position:0%
much um and that generated a lot of cost
 
03:45:40.910 --> 03:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
efficiency um traveling less is been
 
03:45:41.990 --> 03:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
something that we've kind of been
 
03:45:44.990 --> 03:45:45.000 align:start position:0%
exploring because we want to be you know
 
03:45:46.750 --> 03:45:46.760 align:start position:0%
we're very mindful of any burdens that
 
03:45:48.590 --> 03:45:48.600 align:start position:0%
we place on our regulated entities so it
 
03:45:49.870 --> 03:45:49.880 align:start position:0%
was actually something we were kind of
 
03:45:51.910 --> 03:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
exploring before the pandemic but it's
 
03:45:54.510 --> 03:45:54.520 align:start position:0%
been obviously greatly magnified by the
 
03:45:57.189 --> 03:45:57.199 align:start position:0%
fact that none of us can travel anywhere
 
03:46:00.469 --> 03:46:00.479 align:start position:0%
um we've also been exploring um reducing
 
03:46:02.870 --> 03:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
office space to create some budgetary
 
03:46:06.110 --> 03:46:06.120 align:start position:0%
efficiency um we found that um some of
 
03:46:08.189 --> 03:46:08.199 align:start position:0%
our staff can be assigned to full-time
 
03:46:10.550 --> 03:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
Tork and we can track the metrics and
 
03:46:12.710 --> 03:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
see that they're getting their jobs done
 
03:46:14.910 --> 03:46:14.920 align:start position:0%
so um we are beginning to explore red
 
03:46:16.469 --> 03:46:16.479 align:start position:0%
producing our office footprint obviously
 
03:46:18.309 --> 03:46:18.319 align:start position:0%
we do need some office because we have a
 
03:46:21.269 --> 03:46:21.279 align:start position:0%
consumer um facing component of our
 
03:46:23.670 --> 03:46:23.680 align:start position:0%
operations and also we have some um
 
03:46:26.349 --> 03:46:26.359 align:start position:0%
business office staff who um need to be
 
03:46:29.710 --> 03:46:29.720 align:start position:0%
in the office um so we're exploring that
 
03:46:32.630 --> 03:46:32.640 align:start position:0%
um another important thing to note is
 
03:46:35.149 --> 03:46:35.159 align:start position:0%
that um all all the divisions at the
 
03:46:38.590 --> 03:46:38.600 align:start position:0%
banking Department are currently are in
 
03:46:42.670 --> 03:46:42.680 align:start position:0%
about 2020 um as of are now um
 
03:46:44.910 --> 03:46:44.920 align:start position:0%
nationally accredited by the um
 
03:46:46.670 --> 03:46:46.680 align:start position:0%
Conference of State Bank supervisors
 
03:46:48.469 --> 03:46:48.479 align:start position:0%
which is our um National Trade
 
03:46:50.910 --> 03:46:50.920 align:start position:0%
Organization for um Bank
 
03:46:53.469 --> 03:46:53.479 align:start position:0%
Regulators um that's something uh we
 
03:46:56.229 --> 03:46:56.239 align:start position:0%
worked really hard at um specifically we
 
03:46:58.110 --> 03:46:58.120 align:start position:0%
were working hard to adopt make sure we
 
03:47:00.630 --> 03:47:00.640 align:start position:0%
adopted all the best practices um for
 
03:47:03.309 --> 03:47:03.319 align:start position:0%
managing the entities that we uh
 
03:47:05.149 --> 03:47:05.159 align:start position:0%
regulate so that's something we're
 
03:47:06.830 --> 03:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
pretty proud of and we we're looking to
 
03:47:08.910 --> 03:47:08.920 align:start position:0%
maintain that accreditation as we move
 
03:47:11.510 --> 03:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
forward um and finally one last thing
 
03:47:13.189 --> 03:47:13.199 align:start position:0%
I'll mention is that we're continuing to
 
03:47:15.790 --> 03:47:15.800 align:start position:0%
develop and monitor um metric about our
 
03:47:18.429 --> 03:47:18.439 align:start position:0%
operations um that has been um with all
 
03:47:20.269 --> 03:47:20.279 align:start position:0%
these datadriven kind of changes we've
 
03:47:21.269 --> 03:47:21.279 align:start position:0%
been making at the department with
 
03:47:23.550 --> 03:47:23.560 align:start position:0%
databases and timekeeping um that's
 
03:47:25.189 --> 03:47:25.199 align:start position:0%
really created a really data Rich
 
03:47:26.910 --> 03:47:26.920 align:start position:0%
environment that's allowed us to track
 
03:47:28.670 --> 03:47:28.680 align:start position:0%
kind of our efficiencies um so that's
 
03:47:29.910 --> 03:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
something we're going to keep keep
 
03:47:33.550 --> 03:47:33.560 align:start position:0%
moving forward on uh and I'm happy to uh
 
03:47:36.030 --> 03:47:36.040 align:start position:0%
answer any
 
03:47:39.189 --> 03:47:39.199 align:start position:0%
questions that's it Mr chairman well I'm
 
03:47:40.990 --> 03:47:41.000 align:start position:0%
very impressed with this efficiency the
 
03:47:43.830 --> 03:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
model of efficiency that's great
 
03:47:46.429 --> 03:47:46.439 align:start position:0%
um myself that if I don't have to drive
 
03:47:48.870 --> 03:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
to conquer that that saves an hour to an
 
03:47:52.510 --> 03:47:52.520 align:start position:0%
hour home an hour back so it definitely
 
03:47:54.670 --> 03:47:54.680 align:start position:0%
drive time is definitely a a big problem
 
03:47:56.710 --> 03:47:56.720 align:start position:0%
when you have to farflung parts of the
 
03:47:59.389 --> 03:47:59.399 align:start position:0%
state so that's great well as Emilia has
 
03:48:01.229 --> 03:48:01.239 align:start position:0%
said we had been spent we'd spent the
 
03:48:04.750 --> 03:48:04.760 align:start position:0%
past couple two three years planning to
 
03:48:08.229 --> 03:48:08.239 align:start position:0%
drive efficiency through technology and
 
03:48:11.910 --> 03:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
data accumulation and it was I guess you
 
03:48:15.309 --> 03:48:15.319 align:start position:0%
would say a sad occurrence that we land
 
03:48:17.510 --> 03:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
ready just in time for the Corona virus
 
03:48:21.229 --> 03:48:21.239 align:start position:0%
to hit and just stepped right off the
 
03:48:22.990 --> 03:48:23.000 align:start position:0%
traditional way of operating into
 
03:48:26.229 --> 03:48:26.239 align:start position:0%
teleworking and virtual agency very
 
03:48:30.510 --> 03:48:30.520 align:start position:0%
smoothly very quickly on day one that's
 
03:48:33.070 --> 03:48:33.080 align:start position:0%
awesome okay any questions uh
 
03:48:36.269 --> 03:48:36.279 align:start position:0%
representative pusk has a question yes
 
03:48:39.870 --> 03:48:39.880 align:start position:0%
John thank you uh it's slightly
 
03:48:42.349 --> 03:48:42.359 align:start position:0%
technical um for
 
03:48:46.269 --> 03:48:46.279 align:start position:0%
Amilia how difficult was it to first of
 
03:48:50.469 --> 03:48:50.479 align:start position:0%
all were these all access databases and
 
03:48:54.149 --> 03:48:54.159 align:start position:0%
how difficult was it to take this
 
03:48:54.159 --> 03:48:56.349 align:start position:0%
how difficult was it to take this
mass

03:48:56.349 --> 03:48:56.359 align:start position:0%
mass
 
03:48:59.349 --> 03:48:59.359 align:start position:0%
and put them all
 
03:49:02.389 --> 03:49:02.399 align:start position:0%
together uh very I would just to me
 
03:49:05.189 --> 03:49:05.199 align:start position:0%
who's not um a techie person but I do
 
03:49:06.950 --> 03:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
work with the techie Folks at our office
 
03:49:09.910 --> 03:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
quite a bit um it it was very
 
03:49:11.550 --> 03:49:11.560 align:start position:0%
complicated because we sort of had all
 
03:49:14.349 --> 03:49:14.359 align:start position:0%
these cobbled together systems and the
 
03:49:16.550 --> 03:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
best way I can describe it as you know
 
03:49:18.469 --> 03:49:18.479 align:start position:0%
if you were to start out and build a
 
03:49:20.070 --> 03:49:20.080 align:start position:0%
house from scratch you would start with
 
03:49:21.870 --> 03:49:21.880 align:start position:0%
the foundation and then you build the
 
03:49:23.429 --> 03:49:23.439 align:start position:0%
frames and you plan where you're going
 
03:49:25.950 --> 03:49:25.960 align:start position:0%
to put a door and a window and you know
 
03:49:29.030 --> 03:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
you build it nice and neat and square um
 
03:49:30.590 --> 03:49:30.600 align:start position:0%
but what happened over the years because
 
03:49:33.229 --> 03:49:33.239 align:start position:0%
these were all n they were access 97
 
03:49:36.590 --> 03:49:36.600 align:start position:0%
databases that had just been made ad hoc
 
03:49:38.910 --> 03:49:38.920 align:start position:0%
by basically folks in our office even
 
03:49:43.030 --> 03:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
before we had it staff you know um it
 
03:49:45.469 --> 03:49:45.479 align:start position:0%
was quite a mess on the back so what
 
03:49:47.950 --> 03:49:47.960 align:start position:0%
we've done um not to get too technical
 
03:49:52.790 --> 03:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
is we took we um hired a database um I'm
 
03:49:54.110 --> 03:49:54.120 align:start position:0%
not sure the best way to describe her I
 
03:49:56.429 --> 03:49:56.439 align:start position:0%
call her my database magician so we'll
 
03:50:00.070 --> 03:50:00.080 align:start position:0%
call her my database magician um and and
 
03:50:02.790 --> 03:50:02.800 align:start position:0%
she took all of our data and organized
 
03:50:08.389 --> 03:50:08.399 align:start position:0%
it um into SQL uh Ms SQL um backend and
 
03:50:12.070 --> 03:50:12.080 align:start position:0%
then um we put a modern access front end
 
03:50:13.590 --> 03:50:13.600 align:start position:0%
on the database so that we can access
 
03:50:16.309 --> 03:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
that data but now all the data is nicely
 
03:50:19.110 --> 03:50:19.120 align:start position:0%
organized um so you're not like uh you
 
03:50:21.790 --> 03:50:21.800 align:start position:0%
know going into a window to get to the
 
03:50:24.429 --> 03:50:24.439 align:start position:0%
basement to you know it's all
 
03:50:27.309 --> 03:50:27.319 align:start position:0%
square that's how I think of it anyway
 
03:50:30.030 --> 03:50:30.040 align:start position:0%
perfect so if if I could just add
 
03:50:32.910 --> 03:50:32.920 align:start position:0%
something ailia um
 
03:50:36.750 --> 03:50:36.760 align:start position:0%
at in 2016 we had a a very rigidly
 
03:50:36.760 --> 03:50:38.469 align:start position:0%
at in 2016 we had a a very rigidly
siloed

03:50:38.469 --> 03:50:38.479 align:start position:0%
siloed
 
03:50:41.990 --> 03:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
Department um with not much
 
03:50:45.550 --> 03:50:45.560 align:start position:0%
communication among the silos uh and one
 
03:50:47.670 --> 03:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
of the first things to do was to flatten
 
03:50:49.870 --> 03:50:49.880 align:start position:0%
that and open up the doors between the
 
03:50:52.910 --> 03:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
the agencies the divisions of the agency
 
03:50:54.590 --> 03:50:54.600 align:start position:0%
and that's where the management team
 
03:50:56.550 --> 03:50:56.560 align:start position:0%
concept came in and has worked really
 
03:50:58.910 --> 03:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
well that team does everything from
 
03:51:01.070 --> 03:51:01.080 align:start position:0%
designing the budget as a group to
 
03:51:03.070 --> 03:51:03.080 align:start position:0%
talking about technology to doing the
 
03:51:05.469 --> 03:51:05.479 align:start position:0%
strategic planning to continuity
 
03:51:07.710 --> 03:51:07.720 align:start position:0%
everybody works together on that and
 
03:51:10.550 --> 03:51:10.560 align:start position:0%
when we realized that we wanted to
 
03:51:13.670 --> 03:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
become a modern virtual agency we needed
 
03:51:15.469 --> 03:51:15.479 align:start position:0%
technology to do it we looked around and
 
03:51:18.349 --> 03:51:18.359 align:start position:0%
said so how do we do it so everybody
 
03:51:22.030 --> 03:51:22.040 align:start position:0%
talks together so you know this division
 
03:51:24.429 --> 03:51:24.439 align:start position:0%
over here had two of their own databases
 
03:51:25.870 --> 03:51:25.880 align:start position:0%
and this division over here had two
 
03:51:27.590 --> 03:51:27.600 align:start position:0%
databases and it took a lot of
 
03:51:29.670 --> 03:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
cooperation between the divisions to get
 
03:51:34.229 --> 03:51:34.239 align:start position:0%
that done we had one part-time doit
 
03:51:37.189 --> 03:51:37.199 align:start position:0%
embedded person in the agency at that
 
03:51:39.269 --> 03:51:39.279 align:start position:0%
point in time and so that has to be
 
03:51:41.429 --> 03:51:41.439 align:start position:0%
addressed through the budget which is a
 
03:51:43.990 --> 03:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
long slow process but if you look far
 
03:51:45.710 --> 03:51:45.720 align:start position:0%
enough down the the road you can see
 
03:51:48.149 --> 03:51:48.159 align:start position:0%
where the choice point is going to come
 
03:51:49.510 --> 03:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
the fork in the road and you make
 
03:51:50.910 --> 03:51:50.920 align:start position:0%
decisions where you're going to be able
 
03:51:53.189 --> 03:51:53.199 align:start position:0%
to spend your limited amount of
 
03:51:55.189 --> 03:51:55.199 align:start position:0%
resources for the year and we made
 
03:51:58.189 --> 03:51:58.199 align:start position:0%
decisions that we wanted two full-time
 
03:52:01.030 --> 03:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
um tech people in the bank department so
 
03:52:02.550 --> 03:52:02.560 align:start position:0%
we could move the rest of the agenda
 
03:52:05.910 --> 03:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
forward and so the database magician um
 
03:52:08.950 --> 03:52:08.960 align:start position:0%
that um Amelia has mentioned um came on
 
03:52:12.990 --> 03:52:13.000 align:start position:0%
board as did another doit um Tech more
 
03:52:16.149 --> 03:52:16.159 align:start position:0%
techy kind of person um to help us get
 
03:52:19.830 --> 03:52:19.840 align:start position:0%
to where we needed to be for electronic
 
03:52:22.790 --> 03:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
communication and um those are think the
 
03:52:24.469 --> 03:52:24.479 align:start position:0%
big things was that we embraced
 
03:52:26.710 --> 03:52:26.720 align:start position:0%
technology and then made strategic
 
03:52:28.870 --> 03:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
decisions to support
 
03:52:35.429 --> 03:52:35.439 align:start position:0%
it cool good any other questions oh yes
 
03:52:38.110 --> 03:52:38.120 align:start position:0%
Don I was writing down the bill numbers
 
03:52:40.990 --> 03:52:41.000 align:start position:0%
can I got the HB 312 I was listening and
 
03:52:42.309 --> 03:52:42.319 align:start position:0%
I didn't get a chance to write it down
 
03:52:45.429 --> 03:52:45.439 align:start position:0%
my pen died I had to find a new pen
 
03:52:47.149 --> 03:52:47.159 align:start position:0%
can you give me the other bill number
 
03:52:49.110 --> 03:52:49.120 align:start position:0%
just I just want to I like looking them
 
03:52:53.070 --> 03:52:53.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:56.389 --> 03:52:56.399 align:start position:0%
over the other one is still in LSR uh so
 
03:52:58.229 --> 03:52:58.239 align:start position:0%
you won't be able to get to the language
 
03:53:01.950 --> 03:53:01.960 align:start position:0%
quite yet that's right so yeah I would
 
03:53:03.670 --> 03:53:03.680 align:start position:0%
you just look at at the advanced
 
03:53:06.149 --> 03:53:06.159 align:start position:0%
business or look at the committee and as
 
03:53:09.149 --> 03:53:09.159 align:start position:0%
the bills are um because I I I just
 
03:53:12.309 --> 03:53:12.319 align:start position:0%
talked to Paul Smith and he said uh
 
03:53:15.349 --> 03:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
we're now at 42 bills
 
03:53:17.550 --> 03:53:17.560 align:start position:0%
and that he's knew he had he had he's
 
03:53:19.389 --> 03:53:19.399 align:start position:0%
still waiting another 40 bills because
 
03:53:21.830 --> 03:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
of fiscal notes so I assume you're not
 
03:53:23.710 --> 03:53:23.720 align:start position:0%
holding up any bills with fiscal notes
 
03:53:28.389 --> 03:53:28.399 align:start position:0%
but um but uh so otherwise he did say
 
03:53:30.870 --> 03:53:30.880 align:start position:0%
that uh they will be making a decision
 
03:53:33.630 --> 03:53:33.640 align:start position:0%
today um and to whether I can start
 
03:53:36.469 --> 03:53:36.479 align:start position:0%
scheduling bills for next week um and
 
03:53:39.469 --> 03:53:39.479 align:start position:0%
the expectation is that um they really
 
03:53:40.990 --> 03:53:41.000 align:start position:0%
want to make sure all the bills are
 
03:53:42.309 --> 03:53:42.319 align:start position:0%
together so we're scheduling we're
 
03:53:45.309 --> 03:53:45.319 align:start position:0%
bundling things together so once I know
 
03:53:46.950 --> 03:53:46.960 align:start position:0%
when I have all the banking bills
 
03:53:48.590 --> 03:53:48.600 align:start position:0%
together then then we will be scheduling
 
03:53:51.110 --> 03:53:51.120 align:start position:0%
a banking day and and get through all
 
03:53:53.110 --> 03:53:53.120 align:start position:0%
those those different bills
 
03:53:54.870 --> 03:53:54.880 align:start position:0%
representative if you want the LSR
 
03:54:01.590 --> 03:54:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:06.429 --> 03:54:06.439 align:start position:0%
0545 okay and uh so I guess that's about
 
03:54:11.229 --> 03:54:11.239 align:start position:0%
it everybody any more questions and um
 
03:54:13.229 --> 03:54:13.239 align:start position:0%
in the banking Department we've had uh
 
03:54:15.790 --> 03:54:15.800 align:start position:0%
you know over the years we've uh um
 
03:54:18.030 --> 03:54:18.040 align:start position:0%
we've done a lot of recodification and
 
03:54:20.670 --> 03:54:20.680 align:start position:0%
reorganizing the statutes and uh got
 
03:54:23.510 --> 03:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
them all straightened out and for
 
03:54:27.790 --> 03:54:27.800 align:start position:0%
anybody who is interested they do not do
 
03:54:32.149 --> 03:54:32.159 align:start position:0%
Bitcoin Bitcoin is been been pulled out
 
03:54:33.870 --> 03:54:33.880 align:start position:0%
and is done under the consumer
 
03:54:36.309 --> 03:54:36.319 align:start position:0%
protection Division and and I and I
 
03:54:38.349 --> 03:54:38.359 align:start position:0%
guess uh we we will have consumer
 
03:54:41.870 --> 03:54:41.880 align:start position:0%
protection tomorrow but um uh you if you
 
03:54:43.710 --> 03:54:43.720 align:start position:0%
ever when we talk about the most
 
03:54:48.189 --> 03:54:48.199 align:start position:0%
important 358a RSA um there are some
 
03:54:49.790 --> 03:54:49.800 align:start position:0%
little language little things Stucky
 
03:54:51.229 --> 03:54:51.239 align:start position:0%
there on the back that are banking
 
03:54:54.590 --> 03:54:54.600 align:start position:0%
related uh and uh so that over the years
 
03:54:57.670 --> 03:54:57.680 align:start position:0%
that has been an issue but um I think we
 
03:55:00.189 --> 03:55:00.199 align:start position:0%
have good firewalls and we have great
 
03:55:02.309 --> 03:55:02.319 align:start position:0%
protections and we have great statutes
 
03:55:05.070 --> 03:55:05.080 align:start position:0%
and and awesome people and joining our
 
03:55:08.630 --> 03:55:08.640 align:start position:0%
banking department and and uh so we're I
 
03:55:10.550 --> 03:55:10.560 align:start position:0%
think we're in good
 
03:55:12.830 --> 03:55:12.840 align:start position:0%
hands having said that I guess we're all
 
03:55:14.590 --> 03:55:14.600 align:start position:0%
set I guess I want to just let know I
 
03:55:16.710 --> 03:55:16.720 align:start position:0%

address I just I have to use just one
 
03:57:00.710 --> 03:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
address it's it's a it's a field in Zoom
 
03:57:04.510 --> 03:57:04.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not sending you emails from my email

you what I have to do to get this thing
 
03:57:09.239 --> 03:57:10.309 align:start position:0%
you what I have to do to get this thing
to

03:57:10.309 --> 03:57:10.319 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:57:12.950 --> 03:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
happen I got to transfer one mail to
 
03:57:16.750 --> 03:57:16.760 align:start position:0%
another mail to to Comcast so I can
 
03:57:19.189 --> 03:57:19.199 align:start position:0%
bring it up on my laptop because my my
 
03:57:22.149 --> 03:57:22.159 align:start position:0%
desktop does not have a camera and a
 
03:57:25.910 --> 03:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
microphone so it's a it's a little
 
03:57:28.469 --> 03:57:28.479 align:start position:0%
process right well computers are
 
03:57:31.349 --> 03:57:31.359 align:start position:0%
certainly a process but then again I can
 
03:57:33.830 --> 03:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
sit here and look at two computers there
 
03:57:36.670 --> 03:57:36.680 align:start position:0%
you go there's a benefit there is a
 
03:57:38.670 --> 03:57:38.680 align:start position:0%
benefit that's how I called up made sure
 
03:57:41.309 --> 03:57:41.319 align:start position:0%
I just looked up yeah we got 42 bills
 
03:57:44.349 --> 03:57:44.359 align:start position:0%
now yeah well I hopefully we won't have
 
03:57:46.590 --> 03:57:46.600 align:start position:0%
too many issues with with all everybody
 
03:57:49.309 --> 03:57:49.319 align:start position:0%
else um my my particular problem was
 
03:57:52.269 --> 03:57:52.279 align:start position:0%
that my my email address was Prodigy
 
03:57:53.670 --> 03:57:53.680 align:start position:0%
which is some of you might know is older
 
03:57:55.830 --> 03:57:55.840 align:start position:0%
than AOL it's the oldest oldest email
 
03:57:58.229 --> 03:57:58.239 align:start position:0%
address out there and um and there was a
 
03:58:01.349 --> 03:58:01.359 align:start position:0%
conquered uh cable company was decided
 
03:58:03.670 --> 03:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
that Prodigy was anybody who has Prodigy
 
03:58:05.590 --> 03:58:05.600 align:start position:0%
was was fraudulent and they were
 
03:58:07.830 --> 03:58:07.840 align:start position:0%
bouncing all my emails from The Liquor
 
03:58:07.840 --> 03:58:09.389 align:start position:0%
bouncing all my emails from The Liquor
Commission

03:58:09.389 --> 03:58:09.399 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
03:58:13.030 --> 03:58:13.040 align:start position:0%
and so so I I do have a Gmail account
 
03:58:15.830 --> 03:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
because I have a Samsung phone so but I
 
03:58:17.469 --> 03:58:17.479 align:start position:0%
I don't want to give out that too much
 
03:58:18.910 --> 03:58:18.920 align:start position:0%
because it's I'm trying to keep
 
03:58:21.269 --> 03:58:21.279 align:start position:0%
everything on my Prodigy account so but
 
03:58:24.550 --> 03:58:24.560 align:start position:0%
if you ever have problems um that some
 
03:58:26.309 --> 03:58:26.319 align:start position:0%
you know they can can be your related to
 
03:58:27.950 --> 03:58:27.960 align:start position:0%
your email unfortunately your your
 
03:58:30.590 --> 03:58:30.600 align:start position:0%
address but all right so this is great
 
03:58:32.670 --> 03:58:32.680 align:start position:0%
uh we and we'll take this up again at
 
03:58:35.349 --> 03:58:35.359 align:start position:0%
nine o'clock tomorrow morning and thank
 
03:58:37.830 --> 03:58:37.840 align:start position:0%
you all and we'll talk to you tomorrow
 
03:58:39.870 --> 03:58:39.880 align:start position:0%
representative bolo has her her physical
 
03:58:42.070 --> 03:58:42.080 align:start position:0%
hand up oh represent I thought I thought
 
03:58:44.790 --> 03:58:44.800 align:start position:0%
she was waving
 
03:58:48.070 --> 03:58:48.080 align:start position:0%
you want to say something Jane yes I do
 
03:58:50.349 --> 03:58:50.359 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry I didn't attend uh this
 
03:58:51.950 --> 03:58:51.960 align:start position:0%
morning but I'm glad I'm here this
 
03:58:55.070 --> 03:58:55.080 align:start position:0%
afternoon um I know that you're at the
 
03:58:56.710 --> 03:58:56.720 align:start position:0%
state house because the background is
 
03:59:01.149 --> 03:59:01.159 align:start position:0%
very familiar that's a trick oh is it is
 
03:59:04.750 --> 03:59:04.760 align:start position:0%
it there goes my hmer
 
03:59:07.469 --> 03:59:07.479 align:start position:0%
what so is anyone at the state house
 
03:59:10.110 --> 03:59:10.120 align:start position:0%
right now I mean working any
 
03:59:15.149 --> 03:59:15.159 align:start position:0%
committees committees no no no I got an
 
03:59:18.149 --> 03:59:18.159 align:start position:0%
Ann did this picture for me so oh great
 
03:59:20.030 --> 03:59:20.040 align:start position:0%
and another question I know we have a
 
03:59:23.229 --> 03:59:23.239 align:start position:0%
lot of bills so um we'll probably go
 
03:59:26.229 --> 03:59:26.239 align:start position:0%
every day once we get going well you
 
03:59:28.510 --> 03:59:28.520 align:start position:0%
know historically you know we we would
 
03:59:32.070 --> 03:59:32.080 align:start position:0%
be Tuesday Wednesday Thursdays okay the
 
03:59:34.590 --> 03:59:34.600 align:start position:0%
the issue now is that uh the state we
 
03:59:39.309 --> 03:59:39.319 align:start position:0%
only have five count on five of licenses
 
03:59:41.149 --> 03:59:41.159 align:start position:0%
so you know like the old days where
 
03:59:43.670 --> 03:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
every committee could be busy busy busy
 
03:59:45.790 --> 03:59:45.800 align:start position:0%
um only you know only going to be five
 
03:59:49.389 --> 03:59:49.399 align:start position:0%
who be going at a given time so we are
 
03:59:52.790 --> 03:59:52.800 align:start position:0%
going to be told what days we can do our
 
03:59:55.830 --> 03:59:55.840 align:start position:0%
do our hearings and stuff like that um I
 
03:59:57.110 --> 03:59:57.120 align:start position:0%
I told them I'm because I'm on the
 
03:59:59.670 --> 03:59:59.680 align:start position:0%
county executive committee so in chesher
 
04:00:01.189 --> 04:00:01.199 align:start position:0%
so I told them Monday mornings is not
 
04:00:03.429 --> 04:00:03.439 align:start position:0%
going to work for me so hopefully
 
04:00:06.950 --> 04:00:06.960 align:start position:0%
they'll remember that um but so in terms
 
04:00:09.349 --> 04:00:09.359 align:start position:0%
of what days it will be or times it's I
 
04:00:11.710 --> 04:00:11.720 align:start position:0%
I can't it's that that's supposed to be
 
04:00:12.870 --> 04:00:12.880 align:start position:0%
like I said that's supposed to be
 
04:00:15.590 --> 04:00:15.600 align:start position:0%
figured out right now um when they're
 
04:00:17.750 --> 04:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
going to do that and it's somewhat
 
04:00:19.189 --> 04:00:19.199 align:start position:0%
determined by how many bills each
 
04:00:21.550 --> 04:00:21.560 align:start position:0%
committee has and they absolutely want
 
04:00:23.389 --> 04:00:23.399 align:start position:0%
us to do our grouping you know group
 
04:00:25.790 --> 04:00:25.800 align:start position:0%
bills together in terms of the hearings
 
04:00:27.910 --> 04:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
and that even a radical idea of
 
04:00:30.790 --> 04:00:30.800 align:start position:0%
overlapping which Commerce uh we did we
 
04:00:32.910 --> 04:00:32.920 align:start position:0%
dabbled a little bit of that last year
 
04:00:36.510 --> 04:00:36.520 align:start position:0%
with with straws and and plastic bags
 
04:00:38.790 --> 04:00:38.800 align:start position:0%
overlapping and it and it was really
 
04:00:39.830 --> 04:00:39.840 align:start position:0%
necessary because most of the people
 
04:00:41.469 --> 04:00:41.479 align:start position:0%
were coming in to testify from both
 
04:00:43.990 --> 04:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
bills so it made it did make things EAS
 
04:00:45.590 --> 04:00:45.600 align:start position:0%
easier doing that but it also made
 
04:00:47.710 --> 04:00:47.720 align:start position:0%
things a little confusing in terms of
 
04:00:49.309 --> 04:00:49.319 align:start position:0%
you know in terms of the process and how
 
04:00:51.550 --> 04:00:51.560 align:start position:0%
I build here so we'll see me I I
 
04:00:53.950 --> 04:00:53.960 align:start position:0%
generally generally like to do each bill
 
04:00:56.910 --> 04:00:56.920 align:start position:0%
at a time but if some are so over you
 
04:00:59.309 --> 04:00:59.319 align:start position:0%
know so obviously going to you be that
 
04:01:00.870 --> 04:01:00.880 align:start position:0%
you know I might I might join him
 
04:01:03.710 --> 04:01:03.720 align:start position:0%
together but um I don't know we'll see
 
04:01:06.269 --> 04:01:06.279 align:start position:0%
we'll see how it goes yeah and and um I
 
04:01:09.149 --> 04:01:09.159 align:start position:0%
wasn't here this morning so um I I just
 
04:01:11.910 --> 04:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to um give you a little bit more
 
04:01:13.990 --> 04:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
background to let you know that I I
 
04:01:15.710 --> 04:01:15.720 align:start position:0%
served on environment and agriculture
 
04:01:18.510 --> 04:01:18.520 align:start position:0%

04:02:17.870 --> 04:02:17.880 align:start position:0%
you think you I think it went really
 
04:02:21.510 --> 04:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
well um you know there were a couple of
 
04:02:23.790 --> 04:02:23.800 align:start position:0%
members three members came in through
 
04:02:23.800 --> 04:02:24.590 align:start position:0%
members three members came in through
the

04:02:24.590 --> 04:02:24.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:02:26.910 --> 04:02:26.920 align:start position:0%
attendees again right that first thing
 
04:02:28.630 --> 04:02:28.640 align:start position:0%
in the morning yeah yeah and so that's
 
04:02:30.429 --> 04:02:30.439 align:start position:0%
just something to keep an eye out I
 
04:02:32.590 --> 04:02:32.600 align:start position:0%
representative Ammon was one of them and
 
04:02:34.590 --> 04:02:34.600 align:start position:0%
he emailed me about you know clerk
 
04:02:36.510 --> 04:02:36.520 align:start position:0%
responsibility so I wrote back and said
 
04:02:37.870 --> 04:02:37.880 align:start position:0%
you know I'd be happy to talk to him
 
04:02:39.590 --> 04:02:39.600 align:start position:0%
about clerk responsibilities though I
 
04:02:42.309 --> 04:02:42.319 align:start position:0%
knew that Paul Smith would be doing a a
 
04:02:44.510 --> 04:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
Clerk's meeting that's or
 
04:02:47.269 --> 04:02:47.279 align:start position:0%
I don't know I you know he usually does
 
04:02:50.469 --> 04:02:50.479 align:start position:0%
a Clerk's um meeting sort of training
 
04:02:52.870 --> 04:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
session but then then I asked him why he
 
04:02:54.590 --> 04:02:54.600 align:start position:0%
came in as an attendee and he said he
 
04:02:57.110 --> 04:02:57.120 align:start position:0%
didn't get the invitation though I sent
 
04:02:59.469 --> 04:02:59.479 align:start position:0%
it to his the address he asked for you
 
04:03:03.790 --> 04:03:03.800 align:start position:0%
know his Gmail address and I really um
 
04:03:06.469 --> 04:03:06.479 align:start position:0%
am mystified by it because some people
 
04:03:09.349 --> 04:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
is Gmail a problem then maybe it was
 
04:03:11.030 --> 04:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
wasn't it my Gmail that I didn't get
 
04:03:12.469 --> 04:03:12.479 align:start position:0%
because you initially sent it to me
 
04:03:15.030 --> 04:03:15.040 align:start position:0%
that's right Gmail account it might be
 
04:03:17.469 --> 04:03:17.479 align:start position:0%
Gmail's the problem maybe but some
 
04:03:19.309 --> 04:03:19.319 align:start position:0%
that's that's a theory to work on
 
04:03:21.510 --> 04:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
because some people you know said they
 
04:03:23.830 --> 04:03:23.840 align:start position:0%
didn't get it and all I did was resend I
 
04:03:25.630 --> 04:03:25.640 align:start position:0%
didn't change anything I just hit the
 
04:03:27.990 --> 04:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
resend button and it did work didn't
 
04:03:30.630 --> 04:03:30.640 align:start position:0%
work so it's almost like it it needed
 
04:03:33.349 --> 04:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
two tries to it burped it burped at a
 
04:03:34.950 --> 04:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
moment when it well that's exactly what
 
04:03:37.189 --> 04:03:37.199 align:start position:0%
I said I think I think uh Zoom hiccups
 
04:03:39.910 --> 04:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes but you know it's not a good
 
04:03:42.469 --> 04:03:42.479 align:start position:0%
feeling as long as it only hiccups once
 
04:03:44.070 --> 04:03:44.080 align:start position:0%
in the very beginning like gu
 
04:03:47.990 --> 04:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
establishing its root I don't know you
 
04:03:51.469 --> 04:03:51.479 align:start position:0%
know I'm just not a tech person
 
04:03:56.990 --> 04:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
so I do my best um but I do hope we we
 
04:04:00.910 --> 04:04:00.920 align:start position:0%
we establish you know set um you know
 
04:04:03.229 --> 04:04:03.239 align:start position:0%
links so that you just save your
 
04:04:05.070 --> 04:04:05.080 align:start position:0%
Commerce link and you just go in there
 
04:04:07.550 --> 04:04:07.560 align:start position:0%
it's a recurring meeting and and it's
 
04:04:09.269 --> 04:04:09.279 align:start position:0%
like you know just getting yourself to
 
04:04:12.229 --> 04:04:12.239 align:start position:0%
the meeting because it's amazingly time
 
04:04:14.389 --> 04:04:14.399 align:start position:0%
consuming to yeah pain in the budget I
 
04:04:16.830 --> 04:04:16.840 align:start position:0%
have to resend it each time and and well
 
04:04:19.030 --> 04:04:19.040 align:start position:0%
I resend and then people still don't get
 
04:04:20.670 --> 04:04:20.680 align:start position:0%
back so I have to call them I've been I
 
04:04:22.550 --> 04:04:22.560 align:start position:0%
have to call like I had to call most of
 
04:04:24.710 --> 04:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
Commerce and I'm calling most of Edna
 
04:04:26.349 --> 04:04:26.359 align:start position:0%
and it it's like please look at your
 
04:04:29.309 --> 04:04:29.319 align:start position:0%
legislative email and you know they get
 
04:04:31.950 --> 04:04:31.960 align:start position:0%
so much email it's confusing and and
 
04:04:33.710 --> 04:04:33.720 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah and this is this is the time
 
04:04:35.750 --> 04:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
of year where it starts picking up again
 
04:04:39.469 --> 04:04:39.479 align:start position:0%
and and um yeah I understand you know
 
04:04:42.590 --> 04:04:42.600 align:start position:0%
missing emails I believe me I've been
 
04:04:45.950 --> 04:04:45.960 align:start position:0%
there myself but but there's no way to
 
04:04:47.710 --> 04:04:47.720 align:start position:0%
know that they you know we need to know
 
04:04:49.590 --> 04:04:49.600 align:start position:0%
people got it so they can come to the
 
04:04:51.990 --> 04:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
meeting right what was crazy for me
 
04:04:53.710 --> 04:04:53.720 align:start position:0%
because when you sent the notice saying
