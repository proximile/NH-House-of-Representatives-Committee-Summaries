00:09:27.389 --> 00:09:27.399 align:start position:0%
a subcommittee work session for House
 
00:09:32.949 --> 00:09:32.959 align:start position:0%
Bill 264 uh I call to
 
00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:35.240 align:start position:0%
order um
 
00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:38.200 align:start position:0%
the the piece of information we
 
00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:40.360 align:start position:0%
circulated is for some background
 
00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:43.800 align:start position:0%
information as to what is gone on in in
 
00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:46.040 align:start position:0%
the United States as far as current
 
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
status of similar bills and similar
 
00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
actions so I wanted to make sure you had
 
00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:55.000 align:start position:0%
a copy of that information uh just to
 
00:09:58.269 --> 00:09:58.279 align:start position:0%
get us all up to speed okay thank you
 
00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:03.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:05.480 align:start position:0%
so Madam chair for
 
00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
me yes I understand that this is dealing
 
00:10:12.069 --> 00:10:12.079 align:start position:0%
more with the process than the approval
 
00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
in other words it's dealing with how you
 
00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:19.000 align:start position:0%
get to modify the birth certificate not
 
00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:22.120 align:start position:0%
trying to say we can do
 
00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
it that's correct
 
00:10:27.829 --> 00:10:27.839 align:start position:0%
currently um individuals can get their
 
00:10:31.269 --> 00:10:31.279 align:start position:0%
birth record changed it requires uh them
 
00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:34.160 align:start position:0%
to go to court have to have the same
 
00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
medical information the same document
 
00:10:39.629 --> 00:10:39.639 align:start position:0%
that that a physician would sign but to
 
00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:42.920 align:start position:0%
uh but to also um set up a court date
 
00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:47.240 align:start position:0%
and speak to uh a judge who'd make a
 
00:10:52.069 --> 00:10:52.079 align:start position:0%
decision whether or not to change it
 
00:10:55.509 --> 00:10:55.519 align:start position:0%
um I I have found out from some other
 
00:10:58.269 --> 00:10:58.279 align:start position:0%
some transgender people who have gone to
 
00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
court and some of the justices in New
 
00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:04.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire essentially rubber stamp their
 
00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
request they don't ask any questions it
 
00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
comes across the desk and it has a form
 
00:11:13.829 --> 00:11:13.839 align:start position:0%
from a physician and they just stamp it
 
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
and send it along which surprised me
 
00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
because in the past I have heard of a
 
00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:20.200 align:start position:0%
number of Physicians that require
 
00:11:22.629 --> 00:11:22.639 align:start position:0%
in-depth information and sometimes the
 
00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:29.440 align:start position:0%
physician that seems to be very high
 
00:11:31.269 --> 00:11:31.279 align:start position:0%
burden to make the physician have to
 
00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:32.120 align:start position:0%
come to
 
00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
court yes uh as well as um costly
 
00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:38.120 align:start position:0%
because the applicant also has to pay
 
00:11:40.069 --> 00:11:40.079 align:start position:0%
for the physician's
 
00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
time um uh I was also uh I although I
 
00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:48.440 align:start position:0%
changed my information in Massachusetts
 
00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:51.240 align:start position:0%
my physician had to sign my form that I
 
00:11:53.269 --> 00:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
brought down there and notorized it the
 
00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:55.240 align:start position:0%
physician charged me for their time to
 
00:11:58.550 --> 00:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
go get the documents notorized so it was
 
00:12:02.069 --> 00:12:02.079 align:start position:0%
7 $ for their time that's an interesting
 
00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:04.600 align:start position:0%
comment because if I understand what you
 
00:12:06.829 --> 00:12:06.839 align:start position:0%
said and how this supplies
 
00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
here the
 
00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
governing body over the birth
 
00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
record is predicated upon where the
 
00:12:16.829 --> 00:12:16.839 align:start position:0%
birth occurred what I'm trying to get to
 
00:12:19.269 --> 00:12:19.279 align:start position:0%
if I was born in New Hampshire and I'm
 
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
in California now I have to go buy the
 
00:12:22.949 --> 00:12:22.959 align:start position:0%
regulations of New Hampshire because
 
00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
that's where my birth record is however
 
00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
if I'm in New Hampshire as a resident
 
00:12:30.189 --> 00:12:30.199 align:start position:0%
today and I was born in California I'm
 
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
subjected to the rules in California not
 
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is that correct that's
 
00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
correct thank
 
00:12:39.069 --> 00:12:39.079 align:start position:0%
you cuz I was I was asked to add
 
00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
something to U this this bill to allow
 
00:12:46.829 --> 00:12:46.839 align:start position:0%
people from out of state to change their
 
00:12:50.389 --> 00:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
birth record in another state and uh in
 
00:12:52.069 --> 00:12:52.079 align:start position:0%
uh investigating that that would have
 
00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
been an
 
00:12:58.030 --> 00:12:58.040 align:start position:0%
legal uh activity um if I just focused
 
00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:00.040 align:start position:0%
that essent
 
00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
uh the the process that we currently
 
00:13:05.829 --> 00:13:05.839 align:start position:0%
have in place and how could we improve
 
00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
it for one time for individuals to
 
00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
change their information um which is
 
00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:16.760 align:start position:0%
similar to all of our surrounding states
 
00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:22.120 align:start position:0%
and to many that are listed on on um the
 
00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:25.800 align:start position:0%
summary that we've got um it would just
 
00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
be one step the second time any wants to
 
00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
change the information they would have
 
00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
to go and discuss this
 
00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
with um a Justice in the court
 
00:13:42.069 --> 00:13:42.079 align:start position:0%
system um can I ask a question of where
 
00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
birth certificates are required and for
 
00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:44.910 align:start position:0%
birth certificates are required and for
what

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:44.920 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:47.560 align:start position:0%
purposes if you know that um I the
 
00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:49.880 align:start position:0%
background on that sort of is um I
 
00:13:52.269 --> 00:13:52.279 align:start position:0%
actually have an LSR in around suspended
 
00:13:54.509 --> 00:13:54.519 align:start position:0%
licenses because driver's licenses were
 
00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
initially intended just for driving but
 
00:13:58.430 --> 00:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
they've turned into a deao form of
 
00:14:00.949 --> 00:14:00.959 align:start position:0%
identif ification so that means that if
 
00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:02.680 align:start position:0%
somebody has surrenders their license
 
00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:04.040 align:start position:0%
after a suspension they have to get a
 
00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:07.000 align:start position:0%
non- driver's ID but then that has
 
00:14:09.189 --> 00:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
implications that they move out of state
 
00:14:10.829 --> 00:14:10.839 align:start position:0%
because then they're not flagged as a
 
00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
driver and there's so many other
 
00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:16.040 align:start position:0%
consequences of using a government
 
00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
document beyond what it was initially
 
00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
intended for that I I think we find
 
00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
ourselves trying to deal with that creep
 
00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:24.920 align:start position:0%
we have our social security numbers that
 
00:14:27.749 --> 00:14:27.759 align:start position:0%
were intended just for for making sure
 
00:14:30.069 --> 00:14:30.079 align:start position:0%
that we were able to track contributions
 
00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:32.120 align:start position:0%
but now they're essentially our ID
 
00:14:34.749 --> 00:14:34.759 align:start position:0%
number our driver's licenses are our
 
00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:36.160 align:start position:0%
main form of
 
00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:38.120 align:start position:0%
identification and it seems like our
 
00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:39.800 align:start position:0%
birth certificates that should be a
 
00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:42.040 align:start position:0%
historic document of how we were at
 
00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
Birth now we're being used in so many
 
00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
other ways that it it seems like kind of
 
00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
a creep of documents being used for more
 
00:14:53.269 --> 00:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
than they probably should
 
00:14:56.749 --> 00:14:56.759 align:start position:0%
be thank you thank you for that question
 
00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
um as as I I found out well when I got
 
00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:04.360 align:start position:0%
my birth certificate changed I brought
 
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
my my that information to the Social
 
00:15:10.069 --> 00:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
Security office they didn't require the
 
00:15:13.749 --> 00:15:13.759 align:start position:0%
birth certificate what they required was
 
00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:17.160 align:start position:0%
the court issued document with my name
 
00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:20.720 align:start position:0%
change and um and that's proved valuable
 
00:15:23.629 --> 00:15:23.639 align:start position:0%
because um the IRS tracks that
 
00:15:27.069 --> 00:15:27.079 align:start position:0%
information and um does take a look at
 
00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:29.680 align:start position:0%
the individual's name as recorded with
 
00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:31.480 align:start position:0%
their social security
 
00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
number okay on the the
 
00:15:39.629 --> 00:15:39.639 align:start position:0%
passports um you need to provide
 
00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
initially you need to provide a birth
 
00:15:44.949 --> 00:15:44.959 align:start position:0%
certificate and you can you can
 
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
self-identify what your gender is so
 
00:15:50.629 --> 00:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
whatever information is changed on a
 
00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:52.360 align:start position:0%
birth certificate and a birth
 
00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:55.000 align:start position:0%
certificate at the time that has changed
 
00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.509 align:start position:0%
certificate at the time that has changed
currently

00:15:56.509 --> 00:15:56.519 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:15:59.710 --> 00:15:59.720 align:start position:0%
um if you have a court document that
 
00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
says this is my name change as well as
 
00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:06.160 align:start position:0%
the document that the physician says
 
00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:09.560 align:start position:0%
identifies your gender you can get all
 
00:16:13.829 --> 00:16:13.839 align:start position:0%
of that information changed at one
 
00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:18.680 align:start position:0%
time um so if they they have just the
 
00:16:20.749 --> 00:16:20.759 align:start position:0%
doc the document from The Physician that
 
00:16:22.749 --> 00:16:22.759 align:start position:0%
says there's a gender change but there's
 
00:16:26.829 --> 00:16:26.839 align:start position:0%
no name change the name stays the same
 
00:16:29.509 --> 00:16:29.519 align:start position:0%
but the gender can change
 
00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:31.800 align:start position:0%
so when I went to get my birth record
 
00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
changed I had the court ordered name
 
00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
change document at the same time so both
 
00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:40.720 align:start position:0%
were changed at at one time thank you
 
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
that's incredibly helpful I know that's
 
00:16:46.189 --> 00:16:46.199 align:start position:0%
sort of a scope another uh scope creep
 
00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
when you're using the passport for
 
00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
Internal Documentation but that one is
 
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
based on your identity and who you are
 
00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:54.680 align:start position:0%
and how you identify right and I think
 
00:16:56.949 --> 00:16:56.959 align:start position:0%
that that actually is is a great way to
 
00:16:59.710 --> 00:16:59.720 align:start position:0%
be able to show who who you are now yeah
 
00:17:01.629 --> 00:17:01.639 align:start position:0%
who you have become and who you are
 
00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:04.839 align:start position:0%
going forward that's correct and in my
 
00:17:07.669 --> 00:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
case everything was changed on the same
 
00:17:11.429 --> 00:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
date um in Newton Massachusetts the my
 
00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
original birth record still
 
00:17:18.029 --> 00:17:18.039 align:start position:0%
exists um and the the it identifies that
 
00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
was changed um there um and the document
 
00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
that was issued uh issued in
 
00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts didn't include any
 
00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
information about my name change or um
 
00:17:33.789 --> 00:17:33.799 align:start position:0%
birth record information changed on the
 
00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
document they issued okay and sorry as a
 
00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:40.520 align:start position:0%
a clarification that was the document
 
00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:42.760 align:start position:0%
the new document that you received from
 
00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:45.240 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts with your new updated
 
00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
birth certificate didn't annotate that
 
00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:49.640 align:start position:0%
there had been a change that's correct
 
00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:52.240 align:start position:0%
okay right now here in New
 
00:17:54.909 --> 00:17:54.919 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if someone someone goes
 
00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:57.240 align:start position:0%
through the process of getting a court
 
00:17:59.470 --> 00:17:59.480 align:start position:0%
ordered um
 
00:18:02.149 --> 00:18:02.159 align:start position:0%
G or court court ordered modification of
 
00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:06.520 align:start position:0%
their birth record um if they if they
 
00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:09.480 align:start position:0%
update that along with the name the same
 
00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:13.360 align:start position:0%
time there is no marginal note if they
 
00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:16.200 align:start position:0%
do it separately there is a marginal
 
00:18:18.789 --> 00:18:18.799 align:start position:0%
note about their name
 
00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
change okay thank you that's absolutely
 
00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:23.830 align:start position:0%
change okay thank you that's absolutely
helpful

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:27.880 align:start position:0%
yeah but looking through this if I read
 
00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
it correctly L and I'm always subject to
 
00:18:31.909 --> 00:18:31.919 align:start position:0%
reading things
 
00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:34.200 align:start position:0%
incorrectly if I look at the original
 
00:18:36.549 --> 00:18:36.559 align:start position:0%
birth certificate it does get
 
00:18:38.789 --> 00:18:38.799 align:start position:0%
retained the original birth certificate
 
00:18:41.029 --> 00:18:41.039 align:start position:0%
is retained by the city clerk the
 
00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:44.480 align:start position:0%
original birth record is U retained by
 
00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:45.990 align:start position:0%
original birth record is U retained by
the

00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:48.280 align:start position:0%
um our Vital Records Office Vital
 
00:18:49.909 --> 00:18:49.919 align:start position:0%
Records Vital Records by the state of
 
00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:52.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire not the city clerk right
 
00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:53.960 align:start position:0%
okay they don't keep they don't keep
 
00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:56.840 align:start position:0%
those records local to the town it's all
 
00:18:58.990 --> 00:18:59.000 align:start position:0%
in the Vital Records Office but the
 
00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
original is always available the
 
00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:03.880 align:start position:0%
original will still be maintained we
 
00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:11.960 align:start position:0%
correct thank you I I think my my main
 
00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:13.880 align:start position:0%
opposition to this is that it's a birth
 
00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
record and not a Now record the idea of
 
00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:19.960 align:start position:0%
having a passport be a Now record is one
 
00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:21.720 align:start position:0%
of those wonderful things where it can
 
00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:24.400 align:start position:0%
show who you are now but our birth
 
00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
certificates are listed as birth
 
00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:28.360 align:start position:0%
certificates um do you know if there's a
 
00:19:30.909 --> 00:19:30.919 align:start position:0%
I don't think that there's a process so
 
00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
that if um there's a baby and
 
00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
biologically the father is gone from
 
00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:38.480 align:start position:0%
possibly that first night of conception
 
00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:41.240 align:start position:0%
or da of conception or later on and then
 
00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
there's a father who has stepped in and
 
00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:47.960 align:start position:0%
truly is the one who lives as the father
 
00:19:49.549 --> 00:19:49.559 align:start position:0%
and is the one who has raised them
 
00:19:51.789 --> 00:19:51.799 align:start position:0%
possibly from birth or before there's no
 
00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
way to change a birth record to update
 
00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
that that would simply be adopting them
 
00:19:58.230 --> 00:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
even though their true lived reality is
 
00:19:59.870 --> 00:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
is that that other man is the one who
 
00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:01.720 align:start position:0%
truly is their father as opposed to
 
00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:03.880 align:start position:0%
Simply the donor that's understood but
 
00:20:05.909 --> 00:20:05.919 align:start position:0%
the uh yeah that that person would still
 
00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
be listed as an adopted parent okay so
 
00:20:10.789 --> 00:20:10.799 align:start position:0%
following on that
 
00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
logic if a mother at the time of birth
 
00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:18.400 align:start position:0%
on the birth record does not identify a
 
00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
father so it's going to come across as
 
00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:23.480 align:start position:0%
only the recognition of the mother but
 
00:20:26.549 --> 00:20:26.559 align:start position:0%
no father but subsequent to that if the
 
00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:29.480 align:start position:0%
father decides to step forward and take
 
00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:31.480 align:start position:0%
responsibility can they go back and
 
00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
modify the birp rec to include the
 
00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:35.320 align:start position:0%
father's name on the
 
00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:38.240 align:start position:0%
record and um with that is that done
 
00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:40.520 align:start position:0%
through genetic testing or just an
 
00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
attestation that they are in fact the
 
00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:45.320 align:start position:0%
father you know I don't know I don't
 
00:20:47.669 --> 00:20:47.679 align:start position:0%
think we do genetic testing now for the
 
00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:50.720 align:start position:0%
father to begin with so well paternity
 
00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:53.240 align:start position:0%
tests we do I we have some information
 
00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:57.110 align:start position:0%
tests we do I we have some information
from

00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:00.149 --> 00:21:00.159 align:start position:0%
research that some of it's rolled into
 
00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:02.440 align:start position:0%
like child support but across the
 
00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:05.080 align:start position:0%
country um there are
 
00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
specific in statute or in rules that
 
00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:11.480 align:start position:0%
allow a correction for
 
00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:25.350 align:start position:0%
 
they

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:21:27.909 --> 00:21:27.919 align:start position:0%
so that sort of I think helps me
 
00:21:29.549 --> 00:21:29.559 align:start position:0%
understand and what I'm trying to get to
 
00:21:32.789 --> 00:21:32.799 align:start position:0%
is the birth record at the time of birth
 
00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:35.080 align:start position:0%
is not cast in stone it could actually
 
00:21:37.029 --> 00:21:37.039 align:start position:0%
be modified for different reasons
 
00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:40.240 align:start position:0%
depends on state depends on State and um
 
00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:42.360 align:start position:0%
and then as clarification but it may be
 
00:21:45.549 --> 00:21:45.559 align:start position:0%
updated but it is for what is true at
 
00:21:47.909 --> 00:21:47.919 align:start position:0%
the time of birth that because you're
 
00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
establishing them through a paternity
 
00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
test was that a correct understanding
 
00:21:53.029 --> 00:21:53.039 align:start position:0%
that there's a paternity test in most
 
00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
places that do
 
00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:57.029 align:start position:0%
places that do
this

00:21:57.029 --> 00:21:57.039 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:21:57.039 --> 00:22:09.750 align:start position:0%
this
okay

00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:23.549 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:22:23.549 --> 00:22:23.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:35.350 align:start position:0%
 
are

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:40.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:43.240 align:start position:0%
you soorry and I'm not trying to be
 
00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
argumentative or diminish the experience
 
00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:47.080 align:start position:0%
of anybody that's going through it it's
 
00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
just looking at it reading through this
 
00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:51.400 align:start position:0%
I was thinking about how important it is
 
00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:53.400 align:start position:0%
to make sure that people aren't having
 
00:22:55.789 --> 00:22:55.799 align:start position:0%
to present a document that's traumatic
 
00:22:59.029 --> 00:22:59.039 align:start position:0%
to them um and to make sure that they're
 
00:23:01.149 --> 00:23:01.159 align:start position:0%
able to show who they are as they are
 
00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
living but the idea of a birth
 
00:23:06.269 --> 00:23:06.279 align:start position:0%
certificate when it's not the conditions
 
00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
that were at Birth is one of those
 
00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:10.360 align:start position:0%
things that feels like it's a changing
 
00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
of language because it's not a living
 
00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:18.440 align:start position:0%
certificate it is a birth certificate so
 
00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
philosophically I have that issue and I
 
00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:22.480 align:start position:0%
hear what you're saying about it being
 
00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:24.320 align:start position:0%
living versus again something that's
 
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
cast in stone and that's what I'm trying
 
00:23:30.029 --> 00:23:30.039 align:start position:0%
to get to with the researcher it sounds
 
00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
like it is a living document because you
 
00:23:34.669 --> 00:23:34.679 align:start position:0%
can go back and make changes to that
 
00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:37.240 align:start position:0%
document if you can make changes to the
 
00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
document therefore becomes in my opinion
 
00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
a living document and that's what I'm
 
00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
trying to get to with the father if the
 
00:23:46.149 --> 00:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
father is going to be changed and we
 
00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
allow for that to happen then we do
 
00:23:50.269 --> 00:23:50.279 align:start position:0%
allow for the modification if we do
 
00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
allow for modifications to the record in
 
00:23:55.909 --> 00:23:55.919 align:start position:0%
essence it becomes living document um
 
00:23:57.710 --> 00:23:57.720 align:start position:0%
and and thank you for that but if that
 
00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
is is based on genetics and genetic
 
00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:03.080 align:start position:0%
proof that they are the genetic father
 
00:24:06.149 --> 00:24:06.159 align:start position:0%
um that updating it to reflect the the
 
00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
genetic conditions at the time um I
 
00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
think would be is different than being
 
00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:14.120 align:start position:0%
able to reflect that person that adopted
 
00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:16.520 align:start position:0%
them even as a as a three-month-old
 
00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:19.640 align:start position:0%
fetus I I I don't disagree I think the
 
00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:21.080 align:start position:0%
argument I'm trying to make is that if
 
00:24:23.029 --> 00:24:23.039 align:start position:0%
we allow for any modification to a
 
00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
document it's becomes a living document
 
00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:28.200 align:start position:0%
and I think that's probably more point a
 
00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:30.320 align:start position:0%
disagreement there but we know how to
 
00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:32.600 align:start position:0%
disagree in a friendly way so that's
 
00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
good that's one of the things I like
 
00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
about this committee and Like About You
 
00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:39.750 align:start position:0%
about this committee and Like About You
in

00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
particular and I will say the same to
 
00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:45.640 align:start position:0%
representative Leon I do enjoy the
 
00:24:48.909 --> 00:24:48.919 align:start position:0%
ability to have a hearty healthy
 
00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
discussion and at the same time still go
 
00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
out and have lunch absolutely I think
 
00:24:57.149 --> 00:24:57.159 align:start position:0%
the scope of that what this bill says is
 
00:25:00.549 --> 00:25:00.559 align:start position:0%
whatever the current situation is listed
 
00:25:03.269 --> 00:25:03.279 align:start position:0%
on the birth birth certificate as far as
 
00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
parents go that's what's used uh if that
 
00:25:08.669 --> 00:25:08.679 align:start position:0%
information changes on the original
 
00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
birth certificate or even
 
00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:15.640 align:start position:0%
the what whatever in place the original
 
00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
as well as current would be listed on
 
00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:21.440 align:start position:0%
that document as of any any changes
 
00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:23.320 align:start position:0%
because that would be the information
 
00:25:26.269 --> 00:25:26.279 align:start position:0%
required um but if it's been changed
 
00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:28.600 align:start position:0%
it's it's sort of a succession of things
 
00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:32.840 align:start position:0%
if it's been changed um and then like
 
00:25:36.269 --> 00:25:36.279 align:start position:0%
say the the real father is added um that
 
00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:38.720 align:start position:0%
would be an additional piece that's
 
00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
available for information but the gender
 
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
information would have changed in the in
 
00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
the time period thank you do you know
 
00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
how inex birs are handled on I it seems
 
00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
like from what I understand it seems
 
00:25:53.149 --> 00:25:53.159 align:start position:0%
like a best guess which really really
 
00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:56.320 align:start position:0%
really is harmful to interex individuals
 
00:25:59.389 --> 00:25:59.399 align:start position:0%
what the way understand it is that an
 
00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:02.480 align:start position:0%
intersex child when they're born
 
00:26:06.549 --> 00:26:06.559 align:start position:0%
um um there is a notation made on that
 
00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:09.480 align:start position:0%
record that um that still needs to be
 
00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
determined and I think there's a few
 
00:26:14.789 --> 00:26:14.799 align:start position:0%
months time I'm not sure if it's I it's
 
00:26:17.909 --> 00:26:17.919 align:start position:0%
not years if I understand that correctly
 
00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
um and part of that is to allow some
 
00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
development time to figure out whe it's
 
00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
whether one gender is specific or not um
 
00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:30.360 align:start position:0%
and that is it's a challenge for for uh
 
00:26:34.149 --> 00:26:34.159 align:start position:0%
interex people uh as they grow grow up
 
00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
um as as their bodies may change however
 
00:26:41.149 --> 00:26:41.159 align:start position:0%
I know interex people who uh would like
 
00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:43.000 align:start position:0%
to get their gender changed and will
 
00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
have to do something similar in this
 
00:26:47.669 --> 00:26:47.679 align:start position:0%
process to get that changed and that's
 
00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
that would this would actually help them
 
00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:52.120 align:start position:0%
in that process because they can get a
 
00:26:54.269 --> 00:26:54.279 align:start position:0%
statement from the position that says
 
00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
this is the gender they identify
 
00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:58.230 align:start position:0%
this is the gender they identify
as

00:26:58.230 --> 00:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
Madam chair if I may to the
 
00:27:04.669 --> 00:27:04.679 align:start position:0%
researcher what I see under type of
 
00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
process it says administrative court
 
00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
ordered but it also talks about type of
 
00:27:13.789 --> 00:27:13.799 align:start position:0%
certificate it says amended new can you
 
00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:15.640 align:start position:0%
help me understand what's the difference
 
00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.950 align:start position:0%
 
new

00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
new
 
00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:26.510 align:start position:0%
new
whatever

00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
00:27:29.549 --> 00:27:29.559 align:start position:0%
that they might just draw a line through
 
00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:31.960 align:start position:0%
the old one or put a notation in the
 
00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
side saying this
 
00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:36.360 align:start position:0%
Chang so you would see that there was a
 
00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:39.320 align:start position:0%
change on the amended one but they
 
00:27:51.669 --> 00:27:51.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:56.110 --> 00:27:56.120 align:start position:0%
you so if I understand
 
00:27:59.950 --> 00:27:59.960 align:start position:0%
that what this Bill does is it still
 
00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
remain amended or are you looking to
 
00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:04.440 align:start position:0%
make it a new because this issue of the
 
00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
process to get there but at the end of
 
00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:08.200 align:start position:0%
the process are we looking for a new
 
00:28:11.149 --> 00:28:11.159 align:start position:0%
certificate or an amended certificate it
 
00:28:16.269 --> 00:28:16.279 align:start position:0%
it's issued as a new certificate okay um
 
00:28:18.789 --> 00:28:18.799 align:start position:0%
but the original is the original is
 
00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
noted that it has been amended correct
 
00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:24.640 align:start position:0%
because I think one of the things I
 
00:28:27.909 --> 00:28:27.919 align:start position:0%
during the testimony was the fact that
 
00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:29.880 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire the
 
00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:31.880 align:start position:0%
process itself
 
00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:35.360 align:start position:0%
is somewhat flawed it's a process of
 
00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:37.240 align:start position:0%
where to get the form who has the form
 
00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:38.360 align:start position:0%
where to go to B record so that's
 
00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
dealing with the process itself so
 
00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
that's what the spill's trying to clear
 
00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:47.240 align:start position:0%
up clarify or to make more understood
 
00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
easily understood in the process itself
 
00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
to be easier but at the end of The
 
00:28:52.549 --> 00:28:52.559 align:start position:0%
Journey we still going to have a new
 
00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
certificate versus amended one so I want
 
00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:56.840 align:start position:0%
I'll break it apart into two parts one's
 
00:28:59.669 --> 00:28:59.679 align:start position:0%
the process document you're handed
 
00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:03.320 align:start position:0%
currently is you you have a new document
 
00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:10.480 align:start position:0%
you um thank you I'm looking at the New
 
00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire information from the 50 states
 
00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
um comparison there's six months for
 
00:29:16.149 --> 00:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
changes or corrections to the birth
 
00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
record without approval of the registar
 
00:29:21.789 --> 00:29:21.799 align:start position:0%
with using a form so um well six months
 
00:29:23.669 --> 00:29:23.679 align:start position:0%
will give some time for parents of
 
00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
interex children to help figure out so
 
00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:27.440 align:start position:0%
that they're not just randomly assigning
 
00:29:29.909 --> 00:29:29.919 align:start position:0%
birth a gender at Birth um I I
 
00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:31.360 align:start position:0%
definitely understand that that process
 
00:29:33.669 --> 00:29:33.679 align:start position:0%
can be longer and ongoing I've uh had
 
00:29:35.389 --> 00:29:35.399 align:start position:0%
the pleasure of knowing a few interex
 
00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:37.720 align:start position:0%
individuals in my life and they are one
 
00:29:39.549 --> 00:29:39.559 align:start position:0%
the ones I've known are wonderful
 
00:29:41.269 --> 00:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
wonderful unique people that are dealing
 
00:29:43.789 --> 00:29:43.799 align:start position:0%
with a path that not many of us have to
 
00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:45.640 align:start position:0%
walk that's
 
00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
correct this this bill does not
 
00:29:54.669 --> 00:29:54.679 align:start position:0%
address non-binary
 
00:29:58.990 --> 00:29:59.000 align:start position:0%
people um a bill was introduced I
 
00:30:01.789 --> 00:30:01.799 align:start position:0%
introduced a bill over four years ago
 
00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:04.840 align:start position:0%
that was passed in the House and Senate
 
00:30:08.149 --> 00:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
and went to the governor's desk and he
 
00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:13.000 align:start position:0%
did not he he vetoed it um primarily
 
00:30:15.269 --> 00:30:15.279 align:start position:0%
because it included
 
00:30:17.789 --> 00:30:17.799 align:start position:0%
non-binary um there are more States now
 
00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
that have included that um but we still
 
00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:24.200 align:start position:0%
have the same governor and I I know that
 
00:30:27.909 --> 00:30:27.919 align:start position:0%
we have a number of uh uh transgender
 
00:30:31.389 --> 00:30:31.399 align:start position:0%
people that I identify don't identify as
 
00:30:33.269 --> 00:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
non-binary and this would be important
 
00:30:34.909 --> 00:30:34.919 align:start position:0%
to that group of
 
00:30:38.149 --> 00:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
people so I brought it forward as you
 
00:30:38.159 --> 00:30:41.830 align:start position:0%
people so I brought it forward as you
see

00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
today now if if the classification of
 
00:30:47.029 --> 00:30:47.039 align:start position:0%
non-binary is something we need to
 
00:30:49.669 --> 00:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
consider for the future that's the
 
00:30:53.509 --> 00:30:53.519 align:start position:0%
future um I believe that there's only 13
 
00:30:56.549 --> 00:30:56.559 align:start position:0%
states that currently issue uh a
 
00:30:56.559 --> 00:31:00.230 align:start position:0%
states that currently issue uh a
non-binary

00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:02.600 align:start position:0%
identification so I I do want to say
 
00:31:04.430 --> 00:31:04.440 align:start position:0%
Madam chair that the way that you wrote
 
00:31:06.389 --> 00:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
this and the way that you addressed it
 
00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
is a very clear and elegant way to deal
 
00:31:11.669 --> 00:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
with some of that uncertainty over how
 
00:31:14.029 --> 00:31:14.039 align:start position:0%
the court process is handled and the
 
00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
idea of having the court order for
 
00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
return is sort of a disincentive for
 
00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:20.440 align:start position:0%
anybody who wants to be a bad actor
 
00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:22.720 align:start position:0%
because they exist amongst every group
 
00:31:24.669 --> 00:31:24.679 align:start position:0%
of people if you find me a group of
 
00:31:26.549 --> 00:31:26.559 align:start position:0%
people that doesn't have B Bad actors in
 
00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:30.320 align:start position:0%
it I will amazed yes so um I I just want
 
00:31:32.789 --> 00:31:32.799 align:start position:0%
to say that that that that that's not
 
00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:34.720 align:start position:0%
about any any particular group other
 
00:31:36.789 --> 00:31:36.799 align:start position:0%
than the fact that we're all humans and
 
00:31:40.029 --> 00:31:40.039 align:start position:0%
that is why I I decided it was best when
 
00:31:42.669 --> 00:31:42.679 align:start position:0%
we wrote this up that it did
 
00:31:45.549 --> 00:31:45.559 align:start position:0%
require any additional changes would cry
 
00:31:49.789 --> 00:31:49.799 align:start position:0%
approval from u a legislated
 
00:31:49.799 --> 00:31:53.310 align:start position:0%
approval from u a legislated
official

00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:53.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:56.269 --> 00:31:56.279 align:start position:0%
yeah Ian I guess the way that I stand on
 
00:31:59.549 --> 00:31:59.559 align:start position:0%
this is that that if you believe that
 
00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:01.720 align:start position:0%
birth records are something that doesn't
 
00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
reflect birth but reflects who you are
 
00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
now that this is a very good way to go
 
00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:08.600 align:start position:0%
about it but I would like to see a
 
00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:10.440 align:start position:0%
return to birth records being about
 
00:32:13.509 --> 00:32:13.519 align:start position:0%
birth and separating out our now records
 
00:32:15.509 --> 00:32:15.519 align:start position:0%
into a different category and
 
00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:18.240 align:start position:0%
classification and for that reason um
 
00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:19.720 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to be able to support the
 
00:32:22.549 --> 00:32:22.559 align:start position:0%
bill just because I think that we should
 
00:32:24.149 --> 00:32:24.159 align:start position:0%
get back to more clarity on what
 
00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
document does what not because uh of any
 
00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:31.360 align:start position:0%
intent to deny people the ability to
 
00:32:35.269 --> 00:32:35.279 align:start position:0%
truly be who they are but simply because
 
00:32:36.549 --> 00:32:36.559 align:start position:0%
simply because I think that I just need
 
00:32:38.509 --> 00:32:38.519 align:start position:0%
to stick to that foundational
 
00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
principle understood I can appreciate
 
00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:45.200 align:start position:0%
your concern there Madam chair if I may
 
00:32:47.669 --> 00:32:47.679 align:start position:0%
yeah if we go back to first of all I
 
00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:51.240 align:start position:0%
want to say this isn't quite the
 
00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:52.480 align:start position:0%
research I want to commend the
 
00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
researcher for all the work that's put
 
00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
into this if you go back and look on
 
00:32:58.909 --> 00:32:58.919 align:start position:0%
page 30 4
 
00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:02.360 align:start position:0%
of what she
 
00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:05.000 align:start position:0%
provided and if you look under page 34
 
00:33:10.269 --> 00:33:10.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:19.789 --> 00:33:19.799 align:start position:0%
V5 it does in fact allow for a new birth
 
00:33:23.149 --> 00:33:23.159 align:start position:0%
certificate so the end result is not
 
00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
going to change it's just the process
 
00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to use to get there
 
00:33:29.470 --> 00:33:29.480 align:start position:0%
thank you I recognize that so hear your
 
00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
foundational principle I don't disagree
 
00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
with you but I think that issue has been
 
00:33:35.950 --> 00:33:35.960 align:start position:0%
dealt with here in the statute so
 
00:33:37.669 --> 00:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
therefore the statute currently allows
 
00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:40.240 align:start position:0%
for that fundamental or foundational
 
00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:42.720 align:start position:0%
document to be changed all we're talking
 
00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:46.360 align:start position:0%
about here is the process to get there
 
00:33:48.190 --> 00:33:48.200 align:start position:0%
thank you and I also want to thank the
 
00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
researcher for the amazingly thorough
 
00:33:53.669 --> 00:33:53.679 align:start position:0%
job of doing this this is phenomenal um
 
00:33:55.269 --> 00:33:55.279 align:start position:0%
I recognize that that's the way that our
 
00:33:58.470 --> 00:33:58.480 align:start position:0%
laws are currently um I would actually
 
00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
if we can figure out a process I'd love
 
00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:01.720 align:start position:0%
to figure out how we can point more
 
00:34:03.669 --> 00:34:03.679 align:start position:0%
things to a Now record when you're
 
00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
trying to identify how a person is and
 
00:34:07.789 --> 00:34:07.799 align:start position:0%
how they are to be treated today as
 
00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:09.240 align:start position:0%
opposed to the birth record and I'd
 
00:34:12.149 --> 00:34:12.159 align:start position:0%
support any efforts to do that I just I
 
00:34:13.950 --> 00:34:13.960 align:start position:0%
just don't want to move along a process
 
00:34:15.389 --> 00:34:15.399 align:start position:0%
when I think that we need to move away
 
00:34:17.349 --> 00:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
from birth records as anything other
 
00:34:19.829 --> 00:34:19.839 align:start position:0%
than a record of birth understood so and
 
00:34:21.389 --> 00:34:21.399 align:start position:0%
I appreciate all the work that's gone
 
00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
into this I expect that I'll be in the
 
00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
minority with this position but it's one
 
00:34:27.349 --> 00:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
of those where I want to just hold true
 
00:34:29.389 --> 00:34:29.399 align:start position:0%
to what a document is and just stop the
 
00:34:31.629 --> 00:34:31.639 align:start position:0%
scope creep let's reflect who we are
 
00:34:32.869 --> 00:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
with something other than a birth
 
00:34:34.909 --> 00:34:34.919 align:start position:0%
certificate and make it so adults aren't
 
00:34:37.069 --> 00:34:37.079 align:start position:0%
really handing in birth certificates
 
00:34:39.669 --> 00:34:39.679 align:start position:0%
willy-nilly because we know we know
 
00:34:41.869 --> 00:34:41.879 align:start position:0%
you're here we know you exist and we
 
00:34:44.069 --> 00:34:44.079 align:start position:0%
know that who you are today may be very
 
00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
very different than how you started off
 
00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:48.399 align:start position:0%
and that we need to respect and
 
00:34:50.589 --> 00:34:50.599 align:start position:0%
appreciate those individuals and that we
 
00:34:52.069 --> 00:34:52.079 align:start position:0%
need to do that in a way where we're not
 
00:34:54.430 --> 00:34:54.440 align:start position:0%
tying it to a historic type
 
00:34:59.069 --> 00:34:59.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:02.440 align:start position:0%
I believe some of what Society has
 
00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:05.400 align:start position:0%
changed in the the mechanisms that we
 
00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:07.400 align:start position:0%
use information it's probably why
 
00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
organizations don't require a birth
 
00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:14.680 align:start position:0%
certificate for instance our our U DMV
 
00:35:18.109 --> 00:35:18.119 align:start position:0%
does not require a birth record and the
 
00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:20.680 align:start position:0%
um getting a passport Now does not
 
00:35:24.069 --> 00:35:24.079 align:start position:0%
require a birth record uh especially to
 
00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:27.720 align:start position:0%
change things you can and and in both
 
00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:30.440 align:start position:0%
those situations you can self attest as
 
00:35:32.829 --> 00:35:32.839 align:start position:0%
to what is your gender you don't have to
 
00:35:36.270 --> 00:35:36.280 align:start position:0%
have a document from a physician so well
 
00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
thank you and with that I think that
 
00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
it's important to have the birth records
 
00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:41.800 align:start position:0%
to be able to establish citizenship
 
00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:43.000 align:start position:0%
because there's a difference between
 
00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
citizenship and not uh but beyond
 
00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:48.400 align:start position:0%
documenting that you as an individual
 
00:35:50.829 --> 00:35:50.839 align:start position:0%
were in fact born in the United States
 
00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of citizenship I don't
 
00:35:55.309 --> 00:35:55.319 align:start position:0%
really see much value in the birth
 
00:35:57.550 --> 00:35:57.560 align:start position:0%
certificate going forward other than
 
00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:01.240 align:start position:0%
establishing that citizenship correct I
 
00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:02.589 align:start position:0%
establishing that citizenship correct I
I

00:36:02.589 --> 00:36:02.599 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
agree it's interesting you talk about a
 
00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:07.240 align:start position:0%
living document versus a non-living
 
00:36:10.750 --> 00:36:10.760 align:start position:0%
document I'm trying to go through and
 
00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:14.280 align:start position:0%
identify any document out there that is
 
00:36:17.069 --> 00:36:17.079 align:start position:0%
truly not a living document in some
 
00:36:19.390 --> 00:36:19.400 align:start position:0%
capacity I'd say a death certificate
 
00:36:21.470 --> 00:36:21.480 align:start position:0%
it's not and I'm not making a play on
 
00:36:24.069 --> 00:36:24.079 align:start position:0%
words there but once it's been ruled by
 
00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
the medical examiner how you died it's
 
00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
it I believe is almost impossible
 
00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
without a significant evidence to change
 
00:36:34.910 --> 00:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
it but it can be changed and sometimes
 
00:36:36.589 --> 00:36:36.599 align:start position:0%
it comes down to the medical examiner
 
00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:38.240 align:start position:0%
will put down the cause of death and
 
00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
then later on change it based upon other
 
00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:43.000 align:start position:0%
evidence and change the reason for the
 
00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
death so I'm trying to get to is every
 
00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
document we have in some capacity has
 
00:36:51.390 --> 00:36:51.400 align:start position:0%
the flexibility to change that document
 
00:36:54.309 --> 00:36:54.319 align:start position:0%
somewhere along its Journey um thank you
 
00:36:56.829 --> 00:36:56.839 align:start position:0%
and with that you are with those Chang
 
00:36:58.710 --> 00:36:58.720 align:start position:0%
is you're better reflecting the
 
00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:01.480 align:start position:0%
conditions upon that time of death as
 
00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
opposed to any subsequent events just as
 
00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:06.640 align:start position:0%
um our laws allow for a name change for
 
00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:08.800 align:start position:0%
those who are living but other than an
 
00:37:11.109 --> 00:37:11.119 align:start position:0%
infant who dies very very soon it
 
00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't allow for any of those changes
 
00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:15.880 align:start position:0%
for somebody who is now deceased because
 
00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:17.720 align:start position:0%
once you're deceased it pretty much puts
 
00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
a stop on that and as a birth record if
 
00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:22.680 align:start position:0%
we can close that narrow that window to
 
00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:24.760 align:start position:0%
say that the birth is pretty much for
 
00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:27.160 align:start position:0%
the fact that you were born here and
 
00:37:28.829 --> 00:37:28.839 align:start position:0%
beyond that we need to look to other
 
00:37:31.109 --> 00:37:31.119 align:start position:0%
documents to show who you are
 
00:37:31.119 --> 00:37:32.870 align:start position:0%
documents to show who you are
today

00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:35.000 align:start position:0%
correct however if you go back and look
 
00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
at page
 
00:37:39.309 --> 00:37:39.319 align:start position:0%
34 in the first six months you can
 
00:37:41.710 --> 00:37:41.720 align:start position:0%
change the birth
 
00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:45.280 align:start position:0%
record without any court order without
 
00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
any so we do allow for a record to be
 
00:37:52.990 --> 00:37:53.000 align:start position:0%
modified within its first 6 months so
 
00:37:54.910 --> 00:37:54.920 align:start position:0%
therefore if it can be modified in 6
 
00:37:58.589 --> 00:37:58.599 align:start position:0%
months what's that's on that's my
 
00:38:01.309 --> 00:38:01.319 align:start position:0%
argument and you're very very wonderful
 
00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:03.640 align:start position:0%
at mincing words and fighting fighting
 
00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
specific Avenues and I appreciate that
 
00:38:08.109 --> 00:38:08.119 align:start position:0%
very very much um I think that that
 
00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:10.200 align:start position:0%
flexibility is very necessary because
 
00:38:12.270 --> 00:38:12.280 align:start position:0%
otherwise if you had no opportunity to
 
00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
change that you'd have parents coerced
 
00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:18.640 align:start position:0%
into um immediate surgery on their
 
00:38:21.069 --> 00:38:21.079 align:start position:0%
babies when they're born interx and the
 
00:38:23.829 --> 00:38:23.839 align:start position:0%
idea of pressuring a parent into making
 
00:38:25.790 --> 00:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
that decision immediately before they
 
00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:27.560 align:start position:0%
get to know their child get to know the
 
00:38:29.950 --> 00:38:29.960 align:start position:0%
process understand the consequences of
 
00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
those choices I think would be far more
 
00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
harmful than holding that window open
 
00:38:36.109 --> 00:38:36.119 align:start position:0%
for six months especially because our
 
00:38:38.910 --> 00:38:38.920 align:start position:0%
birth record process is one that's that
 
00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:41.560 align:start position:0%
is undergoing some improvements because
 
00:38:44.069 --> 00:38:44.079 align:start position:0%
our birth worksheet has some that needs
 
00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:46.240 align:start position:0%
to be attested to under penalty of law
 
00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:47.720 align:start position:0%
because that's what goes into the birth
 
00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
record and then others that are quite
 
00:38:53.150 --> 00:38:53.160 align:start position:0%
intrusive that perhaps you you shouldn't
 
00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
be held to answering those truthfully
 
00:38:57.630 --> 00:38:57.640 align:start position:0%
under the threat of law when they're
 
00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:00.440 align:start position:0%
social questions and and personal
 
00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
questions that have no bearing on the
 
00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:09.670 align:start position:0%
 
child

00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:13.589 --> 00:39:13.599 align:start position:0%
however when you look at that six months
 
00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:15.960 align:start position:0%
back to the original comment I made
 
00:39:19.950 --> 00:39:19.960 align:start position:0%
earlier about the father it does allow
 
00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
for the mother or the father step
 
00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:24.640 align:start position:0%
forward without a paternity test to be
 
00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
added to that birth record it does allow
 
00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
for incorrection on that birth record
 
00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:32.030 align:start position:0%
for incorrection on that birth record
from

00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:32.040 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
being one gender versus the other gender
 
00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
which is a mistake to correct the
 
00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:38.720 align:start position:0%
mistakes so it's not just the unisex
 
00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:40.720 align:start position:0%
it's a question of that time the record
 
00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
itself is not something at the time of
 
00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:46.680 align:start position:0%
Birth cast in
 
00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
Stone thank you then I guess perhaps we
 
00:39:50.910 --> 00:39:50.920 align:start position:0%
shouldn't call it a birth certificate we
 
00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:54.680 align:start position:0%
should call a fourth and fifth trimester
 
00:39:57.829 --> 00:39:57.839 align:start position:0%
certificate I I I I love getting into
 
00:39:59.349 --> 00:39:59.359 align:start position:0%
these points with you representative
 
00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
Merchant I absolutely do but I I I think
 
00:40:04.589 --> 00:40:04.599 align:start position:0%
that as far as this goes I agree that if
 
00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
this is a process we want to proceed in
 
00:40:08.430 --> 00:40:08.440 align:start position:0%
this is a very well- written bill but I
 
00:40:09.950 --> 00:40:09.960 align:start position:0%
I'm just sticking to my philosophic
 
00:40:12.190 --> 00:40:12.200 align:start position:0%
point that that about the birth
 
00:40:14.910 --> 00:40:14.920 align:start position:0%
records okay very
 
00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:18.680 align:start position:0%
good times lunch any any any add
 
00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:20.109 align:start position:0%
good times lunch any any any add
additional

00:40:20.109 --> 00:40:20.119 align:start position:0%
additional
 
00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
comments no I want to say that I totally
 
00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
understand re Leon um in the issue that
 
00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
she raised in her philosophical beliefs
 
00:40:30.430 --> 00:40:30.440 align:start position:0%
um we are definitely a different sides
 
00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:33.240 align:start position:0%
of the belief on that part of it but I
 
00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
do understand where you're coming from I
 
00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
have a lot of respect for where you're
 
00:40:39.150 --> 00:40:39.160 align:start position:0%
coming from and at this point in time
 
00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:41.720 align:start position:0%
what you said before is what the statute
 
00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
is today is what it is and if I
 
00:40:46.309 --> 00:40:46.319 align:start position:0%
understood correctly is that the way the
 
00:40:48.510 --> 00:40:48.520 align:start position:0%
statute is today you'd like to see a
 
00:40:50.430 --> 00:40:50.440 align:start position:0%
fundamental change in the statute itself
 
00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:52.400 align:start position:0%
which not what we're going to today um
 
00:40:55.870 --> 00:40:55.880 align:start position:0%
to clarify that I think our our I guess
 
00:40:56.790 --> 00:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
if you're talking talking about the
 
00:40:59.270 --> 00:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
living document versus a record of the
 
00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
birth or the first six months of life
 
00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:03.560 align:start position:0%
that would be a fundamental difference
 
00:41:05.589 --> 00:41:05.599 align:start position:0%
um I think that any changes to the law
 
00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
would have to come long after the birth
 
00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:11.000 align:start position:0%
certificate no longer is used for any of
 
00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:12.640 align:start position:0%
these procedures that needs to be a
 
00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
shift that happens culturally and that
 
00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
needs to happen by recognizing other
 
00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:19.720 align:start position:0%
documents and refer letting the law
 
00:41:21.589 --> 00:41:21.599 align:start position:0%
reference other documents as opposed to
 
00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
the verse certificate when you're trying
 
00:41:26.349 --> 00:41:26.359 align:start position:0%
to establish the condition of the person
 
00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:28.520 align:start position:0%
now and they they a true identity now
 
00:41:30.270 --> 00:41:30.280 align:start position:0%
and until that happens there's
 
00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely no reason to do any sort of
 
00:41:35.430 --> 00:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
harm to anybody on changing what these
 
00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
birth certificates are even if in the
 
00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
future there's some idea that all we're
 
00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
doing is a simple snapshot at Birth uh
 
00:41:44.829 --> 00:41:44.839 align:start position:0%
that would be starting at that point as
 
00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:47.560 align:start position:0%
far as I'm concerned and we have a lot
 
00:41:49.950 --> 00:41:49.960 align:start position:0%
of societal shifts that need to happen
 
00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
to recognize that that the people's true
 
00:41:55.069 --> 00:41:55.079 align:start position:0%
lived reality can be very different from
 
00:41:58.069 --> 00:41:58.079 align:start position:0%
how they were born um before we can get
 
00:42:00.109 --> 00:42:00.119 align:start position:0%
to changing any of those details and I
 
00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:02.200 align:start position:0%
think that as Society ships that way to
 
00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
recognize that it almost becomes a
 
00:42:06.270 --> 00:42:06.280 align:start position:0%
relevant um around that part of the
 
00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
birth certificate because if we are no
 
00:42:10.190 --> 00:42:10.200 align:start position:0%
longer using a birth certificate to
 
00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:14.560 align:start position:0%
prove who we are when we're 43 or 57 or
 
00:42:19.309 --> 00:42:19.319 align:start position:0%
89 or even 18 that it no longer no
 
00:42:21.589 --> 00:42:21.599 align:start position:0%
longer carries that consequence and it
 
00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
would be a very very different document
 
00:42:26.829 --> 00:42:26.839 align:start position:0%
yes so do we have a birth record in a
 
00:42:26.839 --> 00:42:30.589 align:start position:0%
yes so do we have a birth record in a
birth

00:42:30.589 --> 00:42:30.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:33.150 --> 00:42:33.160 align:start position:0%
certificate I think I think I think we
 
00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
just need to move away from the birth
 
00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
certificate as a form of identification
 
00:42:39.589 --> 00:42:39.599 align:start position:0%
uh for anything other than
 
00:42:43.589 --> 00:42:43.599 align:start position:0%
citizenship I I I think we're I think
 
00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
we're discussing something that probably
 
00:42:49.230 --> 00:42:49.240 align:start position:0%
goes much further than than what's being
 
00:42:51.109 --> 00:42:51.119 align:start position:0%
proposed this is mental gymnastics
 
00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:53.680 align:start position:0%
between myself and repres probably a
 
00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
societal change um and how we how we
 
00:43:00.670 --> 00:43:00.680 align:start position:0%
view things um and what's required and I
 
00:43:03.190 --> 00:43:03.200 align:start position:0%
think some of that is occurring Now with
 
00:43:04.829 --> 00:43:04.839 align:start position:0%
uh where
 
00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
organizations legal organizations are
 
00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:08.430 align:start position:0%
organizations legal organizations are
not

00:43:08.430 --> 00:43:08.440 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:43:10.349 --> 00:43:10.359 align:start position:0%
requiring the same thing that we
 
00:43:13.510 --> 00:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
required 20 years ago Madam chair I'll
 
00:43:15.309 --> 00:43:15.319 align:start position:0%
make a motion
 
00:43:19.150 --> 00:43:19.160 align:start position:0%
to approve the bill as written and
 
00:43:20.910 --> 00:43:20.920 align:start position:0%
recommendation to the committee to be
 
00:43:25.069 --> 00:43:25.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:25.079 --> 00:43:27.030 align:start position:0%
 
written

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
written
 
00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
thank you um I'll I guess I will second
 
00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:32.000 align:start position:0%

affirmative okay uh my vote is to vote

that we should move towards the separate
 
00:43:53.549 --> 00:43:53.559 align:start position:0%
recognition of who you are sorry it's
