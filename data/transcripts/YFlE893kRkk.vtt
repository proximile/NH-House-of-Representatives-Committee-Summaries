00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.790 align:start position:0%
I will open the hearing for a house bill

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 align:start position:0%
221
 
00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 align:start position:0%
and here this morning to introduce this
 
00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:47.150 align:start position:0%
and here this morning to introduce this
bill

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:55.979 align:start position:0%
so uh House Bill 221 is a department
 
00:05:59.210 --> 00:05:59.220 align:start position:0%
request and uh what it does is it makes
 
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
a modif minor modification in the soil
 
00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:03.479 align:start position:0%
conservation and farmland preservation
 
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:07.620 align:start position:0%
subdivision of RSA 432 and this section
 
00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:10.039 align:start position:0%
deals with uh acquisition of
 
00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:12.900 align:start position:0%
agricultural land development rights as
 
00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:14.940 align:start position:0%
a way to preserve farmland
 
00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:17.759 align:start position:0%
currently the state biased that they
 
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:20.220 align:start position:0%
want to preserve and it has to be this
 
00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
and the development rights have to be
 
00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:26.100 align:start position:0%
deeded to the state and this Arrangement
 
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
actually impedes the possibility of how
 
00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:30.479 align:start position:0%
much Farmland we can preserve because
 
00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:32.580 align:start position:0%
it's not possible to get a third party
 
00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:35.100 align:start position:0%
to purchase the farmland and just make
 
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
sure that the deed is uh is carried out
 
00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:40.740 align:start position:0%
so what this bill does is it it adds a
 
00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:43.560 align:start position:0%
line adds half a sentence to the statute
 
00:06:47.689 --> 00:06:47.699 align:start position:0%
saying that uh the state has uh can
 
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:51.660 align:start position:0%
either buy the land or have the right to
 
00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:56.280 align:start position:0%
enforce the deed restrictions and uh so
 
00:06:59.689 --> 00:06:59.699 align:start position:0%
I'm going to say if you have questions
 
00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
um please direct them to the
 
00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.990 align:start position:0%
um please direct them to the
commissioner

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Bixby does
 
00:07:10.189 --> 00:07:10.199 align:start position:0%
anybody have oh you're deferring your
 
00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:12.900 align:start position:0%
questions to to the commissioner
 
00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:14.340 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:15.850 align:start position:0%
thank you
everybody

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:15.860 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
00:07:19.969 --> 00:07:19.979 align:start position:0%
okay fine yes sir
 
00:07:22.129 --> 00:07:22.139 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair I was just
 
00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:23.400 align:start position:0%
wondering as a new member of the
 
00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:24.780 align:start position:0%
committee relatively inexperienced could
 
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
you give us an example of this kind of
 
00:07:29.089 --> 00:07:29.099 align:start position:0%
third party
 
00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
uh purchase uh that's in the statement
 
00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:33.780 align:start position:0%
representative uh he
 
00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:35.880 align:start position:0%
he has deferred his questions to the
 
00:07:37.969 --> 00:07:37.979 align:start position:0%
commissioner so when the commissioner
 
00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:40.500 align:start position:0%
comes up to testify you are more than
 
00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:42.120 align:start position:0%
welcome to ask him
 
00:07:46.189 --> 00:07:46.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:48.409 --> 00:07:48.419 align:start position:0%
so at this time I'll call commissioner
 
00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:52.500 align:start position:0%
Sean Jasper to testify on House Bill 221
 
00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:54.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:07:56.629 --> 00:07:56.639 align:start position:0%
and good morning
 
00:07:58.610 --> 00:07:58.620 align:start position:0%
good morning Madam chairman members of
 
00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:01.020 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record I am Sean
 
00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
Jasper commissioner of the New Hampshire
 
00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:04.740 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture markets and
 
00:08:08.089 --> 00:08:08.099 align:start position:0%
food and I am here in support of House
 
00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:10.340 align:start position:0%
Bill 221 and I want to thank
 
00:08:13.129 --> 00:08:13.139 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby for putting this
 
00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:16.940 align:start position:0%
bill in at rbhest
 
00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
essentially the department
 
00:08:23.629 --> 00:08:23.639 align:start position:0%
um has not been in the business of
 
00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:25.500 align:start position:0%
purchasing development rights since
 
00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:28.280 align:start position:0%
l-chip came along but we do hold about
 
00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
86 D or deed restrictions on properties
 
00:08:33.829 --> 00:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
around the state
 
00:08:40.029 --> 00:08:40.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:43.140 align:start position:0%
by ourselves and we do have some help on
 
00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:46.740 align:start position:0%
that but what the current statute does
 
00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:49.320 align:start position:0%
is limit our ability really to protect
 
00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:51.180 align:start position:0%
as much land as we could
 
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:54.720 align:start position:0%
currently most of the land that is
 
00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:56.580 align:start position:0%
protected around the state now whether
 
00:08:59.210 --> 00:08:59.220 align:start position:0%
it be agricultural forestry is done
 
00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:01.800 align:start position:0%
through multiple parties including the
 
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
land trusts there are land trusts that
 
00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:07.260 align:start position:0%
serve every cover every part of the
 
00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
state they tend to be much better
 
00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:11.940 align:start position:0%
stewards of watching out what's going on
 
00:09:15.829 --> 00:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
there's also money available through
 
00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:19.860 align:start position:0%
the USDA and
 
00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:22.200 align:start position:0%
some of those restrictions make it
 
00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:24.420 align:start position:0%
possible impossible for us to act in
 
00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:26.940 align:start position:0%
concert with others this would modernize
 
00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
the statute and allow us to be a player
 
00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
in this and not have to
 
00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:33.590 align:start position:0%
in this and not have to
um

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:37.140 align:start position:0%
simply hold hold the title or the deed
 
00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
restrictions ourselves and I think this
 
00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:41.820 align:start position:0%
is a much better model that might still
 
00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:43.620 align:start position:0%
happen we might still be the only ones
 
00:09:46.009 --> 00:09:46.019 align:start position:0%
on some smaller Parcels but when we get
 
00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
into the the larger Parcels which are
 
00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:50.100 align:start position:0%
really the ones we
 
00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:52.200 align:start position:0%
um should be protecting
 
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
um we're never going to be able to to do
 
00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:56.220 align:start position:0%
that with the amount of money that we
 
00:09:59.750 --> 00:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
have so this is our solution to make
 
00:10:02.509 --> 00:10:02.519 align:start position:0%
um the department a once again player
 
00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:05.940 align:start position:0%
and part participating in this and
 
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
working with others to make that happen
 
00:10:11.509 --> 00:10:11.519 align:start position:0%
and I'll be glad to answer any questions
 
00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:13.740 align:start position:0%
um I did hear that the question that was
 
00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:16.500 align:start position:0%
asked so one that's ongoing right now is
 
00:10:18.949 --> 00:10:18.959 align:start position:0%
in the town of Greenland a great Bay
 
00:10:18.959 --> 00:10:19.910 align:start position:0%
in the town of Greenland a great Bay
Farm

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
Farm
 
00:10:23.389 --> 00:10:23.399 align:start position:0%
and it is um involves salt which is the
 
00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:26.940 align:start position:0%
southeast land trust it involves l-chip
 
00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
and it involves the town of Greenland
 
00:10:32.449 --> 00:10:32.459 align:start position:0%
itself so those three parties have come
 
00:10:35.449 --> 00:10:35.459 align:start position:0%
together to to purchase the development
 
00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
rights on that piece of property which
 
00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:41.100 align:start position:0%
is part of Great Bay Farm and
 
00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
um and so obviously if we had this
 
00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:45.660 align:start position:0%
statue in place we would have been able
 
00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:51.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr commissioner representative
 
00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:55.490 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr commissioner representative
knabb

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:55.500 align:start position:0%
knabb
 
00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
hi madam chair thank you very much I was
 
00:10:58.910 --> 00:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
wondering if the commissioner could
 
00:11:00.769 --> 00:11:00.779 align:start position:0%
speak to is this considered a secondary
 
00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:02.700 align:start position:0%
easement holder is that the role that
 
00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:05.100 align:start position:0%
the department would take on you may ask
 
00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
your question directly to the
 
00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner oh thank you yes uh that's
 
00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:13.380 align:start position:0%
exactly what we would be for instance in
 
00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:15.720 align:start position:0%
uh in the case of what's going on in
 
00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:18.360 align:start position:0%
Greenland I'm not sure who who the
 
00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
underlying a holder is it could be
 
00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:23.220 align:start position:0%
Greenland it could be salt
 
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
um and that would be the type of things
 
00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:28.140 align:start position:0%
that we would continue to do l-chip is
 
00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
not a primary holder
 
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:38.269 --> 00:11:38.279 align:start position:0%
uh really want to be and so we would
 
00:11:38.279 --> 00:11:39.590 align:start position:0%
uh really want to be and so we would
then

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
give up no rights because we would be
 
00:11:44.269 --> 00:11:44.279 align:start position:0%
able to uh enforce the terms and that's
 
00:11:45.949 --> 00:11:45.959 align:start position:0%
the important thing it's not that we
 
00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:48.060 align:start position:0%
hold it ourselves it's our ability to go
 
00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:50.220 align:start position:0%
in if we see something going on and find
 
00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:52.500 align:start position:0%
we could go in and enforce those rights
 
00:11:58.190 --> 00:11:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:01.140 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
representative smart
 
00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:05.100 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I was just
 
00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
wondering if there and and you might
 
00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:09.060 align:start position:0%
have spoken to this and it went over my
 
00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:10.370 align:start position:0%
have spoken to this and it went over my
head

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:10.380 align:start position:0%
head
 
00:12:15.829 --> 00:12:15.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
um for to protect the property from the
 
00:12:21.769 --> 00:12:21.779 align:start position:0%
state where if say in the future they
 
00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:23.519 align:start position:0%
think it's better to run a highway
 
00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:27.200 align:start position:0%
through it or put a municipal parking or
 
00:12:29.509 --> 00:12:29.519 align:start position:0%
low-income housing or what do they call
 
00:12:32.329 --> 00:12:32.339 align:start position:0%
it now affordable housing I
 
00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:34.860 align:start position:0%
my recollection of any of these deeds
 
00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
and I'm sorry that's if I'm getting too
 
00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
far away from the mic but I usually
 
00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:40.380 align:start position:0%
project pretty well yeah
 
00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:43.380 align:start position:0%
um there is always the risk of eminent
 
00:12:45.889 --> 00:12:45.899 align:start position:0%
domain in these if the state has a
 
00:12:49.069 --> 00:12:49.079 align:start position:0%
higher use any of the Deeds I've ever
 
00:12:49.079 --> 00:12:50.150 align:start position:0%
higher use any of the Deeds I've ever
seen

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
seen
 
00:12:52.069 --> 00:12:52.079 align:start position:0%
but really that has just been for
 
00:12:52.079 --> 00:12:53.569 align:start position:0%
but really that has just been for
Highway

00:12:53.569 --> 00:12:53.579 align:start position:0%
Highway
 
00:12:56.690 --> 00:12:56.700 align:start position:0%
um in new New Hampshire I don't think
 
00:12:59.449 --> 00:12:59.459 align:start position:0%
we really go much beyond that not for
 
00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:01.620 align:start position:0%
private development I think as I recall
 
00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:03.180 align:start position:0%
there was a constitutional amendment
 
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
that was passed a few years ago because
 
00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:09.420 align:start position:0%
of that concern of the state acting on
 
00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:12.260 align:start position:0%
behalf of private entities
 
00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
so I know for instance as I'm a
 
00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
non-voting member of l-chip there's a
 
00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
road up north that needed to be
 
00:13:25.009 --> 00:13:25.019 align:start position:0%
relocated on land that we had an
 
00:13:28.069 --> 00:13:28.079 align:start position:0%
interest in and so yeah that road is
 
00:13:31.069 --> 00:13:31.079 align:start position:0%
going to be relocated uh it will take a
 
00:13:32.829 --> 00:13:32.839 align:start position:0%
small small amount
 
00:13:35.509 --> 00:13:35.519 align:start position:0%
but that is about the only thing that
 
00:13:38.449 --> 00:13:38.459 align:start position:0%
I'm that I'm aware of and the good thing
 
00:13:38.459 --> 00:13:40.069 align:start position:0%
I'm that I'm aware of and the good thing
about

00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:44.820 align:start position:0%
having multiple people hold interest in
 
00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:47.220 align:start position:0%
this in my opinion one thing that people
 
00:13:50.569 --> 00:13:50.579 align:start position:0%
don't realize is that when an easement
 
00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:53.820 align:start position:0%
is held that is a a bundle of Rights but
 
00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
the the land itself is still held by
 
00:13:59.329 --> 00:13:59.339 align:start position:0%
someone else
 
00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:03.060 align:start position:0%
and so for instance if and I'll use the
 
00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:04.740 align:start position:0%
town of Hudson if the town of Hudson
 
00:14:06.889 --> 00:14:06.899 align:start position:0%
held an interest in a parcel
 
00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:09.720 align:start position:0%
and then there was a landowner if the
 
00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:11.660 align:start position:0%
land holder
 
00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
made a offer of enough money to the town
 
00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
the town could sell that bundle of
 
00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:22.380 align:start position:0%
rights back to the landowner and then
 
00:14:25.009 --> 00:14:25.019 align:start position:0%
that deed can go away
 
00:14:28.269 --> 00:14:28.279 align:start position:0%
because it's held in by one one person
 
00:14:31.129 --> 00:14:31.139 align:start position:0%
and people don't think that is possible
 
00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:34.380 align:start position:0%
but but there is no magical thing where
 
00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
development rights go away and can never
 
00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
be reclaimed but they can they can be if
 
00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
all the bundle of Rights end up in the
 
00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
same place so having multiple interest
 
00:14:46.009 --> 00:14:46.019 align:start position:0%
holders here is much more likely to
 
00:14:48.949 --> 00:14:48.959 align:start position:0%
prevent that from happening because the
 
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
state potentially could sell its
 
00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:53.220 align:start position:0%
interest but
 
00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:56.100 align:start position:0%
for instance salt or some other landown
 
00:14:58.910 --> 00:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
would still have their interest l-chip
 
00:15:00.949 --> 00:15:00.959 align:start position:0%
would still have their interest and it
 
00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:04.260 align:start position:0%
would be almost uh impossible to for
 
00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
that underlying landowner to bring all
 
00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:14.940 align:start position:0%
thank you and I uh representative roulog
 
00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:18.180 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh commissioner
 
00:15:20.629 --> 00:15:20.639 align:start position:0%
who puts the restrictions on on the
 
00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:22.740 align:start position:0%
Deeds does the department do that the
 
00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:25.620 align:start position:0%
deed restrictions generally the ones we
 
00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:26.820 align:start position:0%
have yes
 
00:15:30.769 --> 00:15:30.779 align:start position:0%
so it what I'm suggesting here is that
 
00:15:30.779 --> 00:15:32.030 align:start position:0%
so it what I'm suggesting here is that
whoever

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
whoever
 
00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
the underlying holder would be would put
 
00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:38.720 align:start position:0%
those restrictions on
 
00:15:41.269 --> 00:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
potentially it could be us still in in
 
00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
some cases but we would have that right
 
00:15:47.269 --> 00:15:47.279 align:start position:0%
to enforcement so that if for instance a
 
00:15:50.449 --> 00:15:50.459 align:start position:0%
land trust or a town decided to look the
 
00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:51.660 align:start position:0%
other way
 
00:15:53.569 --> 00:15:53.579 align:start position:0%
and say oh we really don't care we're
 
00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:55.500 align:start position:0%
okay with what they're doing if it
 
00:15:58.490 --> 00:15:58.500 align:start position:0%
violated the terms of
 
00:16:00.829 --> 00:16:00.839 align:start position:0%
the easement the state of New Hampshire
 
00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:03.060 align:start position:0%
could still step in and enforce those
 
00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:06.660 align:start position:0%
rights Mitch so if I follow up yeah so
 
00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:09.180 align:start position:0%
if I'm a farmer and I say oh you know I
 
00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:11.100 align:start position:0%
I want to have cattle and the department
 
00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
would say well you can't have cattle but
 
00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:14.940 align:start position:0%
he can have produce
 
00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:17.160 align:start position:0%
generally I mean that would be something
 
00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:19.740 align:start position:0%
that I don't think we would ever want to
 
00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:22.980 align:start position:0%
see in a deed all of the Deeds that I'm
 
00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
aware of really cover agricultural
 
00:16:27.769 --> 00:16:27.779 align:start position:0%
production and
 
00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:30.540 align:start position:0%
there are certain things that we've
 
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
learned over the years
 
00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:36.740 align:start position:0%
um that we want to be more clear on
 
00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
agritourism is is a big part of that now
 
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
and so in some cases and there's there's
 
00:16:46.069 --> 00:16:46.079 align:start position:0%
a case that uh it's not a case but an
 
00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
instance in Westmoreland where it was
 
00:16:50.689 --> 00:16:50.699 align:start position:0%
very clear you couldn't land airplanes
 
00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:52.620 align:start position:0%
there they were doing that you couldn't
 
00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:55.320 align:start position:0%
use it for parking they were doing that
 
00:16:58.069 --> 00:16:58.079 align:start position:0%
and we said the terms of the deed do not
 
00:17:00.889 --> 00:17:00.899 align:start position:0%
allow that had you wanted to do that you
 
00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
could have said there would be X number
 
00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
of events allowed per year on this
 
00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:07.860 align:start position:0%
agricultural land so those things need
 
00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:10.260 align:start position:0%
to be spelled out in advance and in this
 
00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:12.360 align:start position:0%
case they were pretty specific that they
 
00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
couldn't happen
 
00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:17.220 align:start position:0%
um and so while it had been going on
 
00:17:19.309 --> 00:17:19.319 align:start position:0%
was eventually discovered that there was
 
00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:21.240 align:start position:0%
that violation we said no you can't do
 
00:17:24.409 --> 00:17:24.419 align:start position:0%
this anymore thank you
 
00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
uh representative Howard
 
00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:28.740 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman
 
00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
um did did this um commission hold the
 
00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:34.260 align:start position:0%
right to enforce this in the past or the
 
00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:35.940 align:start position:0%
state hold the right to enforce this in
 
00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:37.380 align:start position:0%
the past and we lost it and now we're
 
00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:40.440 align:start position:0%
getting it back no no we hold it now the
 
00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:43.260 align:start position:0%
problem is we haven't been able to be we
 
00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
haven't been able to play with others if
 
00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:47.340 align:start position:0%
you will it's either us holding the
 
00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
right all by ourselves which limits the
 
00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:53.460 align:start position:0%
size of the land the amount of money
 
00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:55.260 align:start position:0%
that we have because we don't have a law
 
00:17:58.250 --> 00:17:58.260 align:start position:0%
we've been putting about 250 000 a year
 
00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:01.020 align:start position:0%
into the fund over the last few years
 
00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't give us a lot if you're
 
00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:07.020 align:start position:0%
talking huge acreage but um so this
 
00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:08.820 align:start position:0%
would just simply allow us to
 
00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:10.980 align:start position:0%
participate with others because very
 
00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:13.340 align:start position:0%
often there's not enough money out there
 
00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:15.660 align:start position:0%
to take advantage of and some of it's
 
00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:17.820 align:start position:0%
matching for instance the money with the
 
00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:23.580 align:start position:0%
excuse me so
 
00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:28.020 align:start position:0%
even l-chip and the land trusts would be
 
00:18:31.549 --> 00:18:31.559 align:start position:0%
able to access some money but with us
 
00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
coming in we'd be able to access more so
 
00:18:37.669 --> 00:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
that the the total really increases
 
00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:40.020 align:start position:0%
and this is really about getting more
 
00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:43.860 align:start position:0%
money into uh from from the feds and you
 
00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:46.260 align:start position:0%
know is why I want us to be a player is
 
00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
to access that money we keep leaving
 
00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:51.240 align:start position:0%
money on the table in the in the federal
 
00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:53.460 align:start position:0%
Farm Bill
 
00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:18:56.810 --> 00:18:56.820 align:start position:0%
um I have a question in so far as
 
00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:58.270 align:start position:0%
um I have a question in so far as
enforcement

00:18:58.270 --> 00:18:58.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
it says the state shall have the right
 
00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:02.820 align:start position:0%
to enforce the terms of the deed what
 
00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:05.340 align:start position:0%
what types of things are included in
 
00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:07.500 align:start position:0%
enforcement is there legal action is
 
00:19:09.529 --> 00:19:09.539 align:start position:0%
there what there is legal action if
 
00:19:09.539 --> 00:19:10.909 align:start position:0%
there what there is legal action if
necessary

00:19:10.909 --> 00:19:10.919 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
00:19:10.919 --> 00:19:11.750 align:start position:0%
necessary
um

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:14.220 align:start position:0%
I am not aware of us having to take
 
00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:16.980 align:start position:0%
legal action but that is a possibility
 
00:19:20.029 --> 00:19:20.039 align:start position:0%
we go out now we find violations we work
 
00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:23.160 align:start position:0%
with the landowner to correct those
 
00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:24.900 align:start position:0%
those deficiencies
 
00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:26.940 align:start position:0%
this makes sure that we still have the
 
00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:29.880 align:start position:0%
ability to go on to the land I'm going
 
00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:31.740 align:start position:0%
to assume we would do that in concert
 
00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:33.720 align:start position:0%
with the other
 
00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:34.310 align:start position:0%
with the other
um

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:35.570 align:start position:0%
um
players

00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:35.580 align:start position:0%
players
 
00:19:39.049 --> 00:19:39.059 align:start position:0%
but it gives us another set of eyes and
 
00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:41.100 align:start position:0%
the ability to go in and as I said if
 
00:19:42.409 --> 00:19:42.419 align:start position:0%
somebody said ah we don't really care
 
00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
about this but we cared about it we
 
00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:46.260 align:start position:0%
would still have that right to go to
 
00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
court if if we felt it necessary it
 
00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't it doesn't
 
00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:53.580 align:start position:0%
say that we all have to agree if we see
 
00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:55.980 align:start position:0%
a deed violation we have the independent
 
00:19:59.330 --> 00:19:59.340 align:start position:0%
right to enforce the violation
 
00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh
 
00:20:06.049 --> 00:20:06.059 align:start position:0%
representative Potenza
 
00:20:07.909 --> 00:20:07.919 align:start position:0%
so just a question about the example
 
00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:09.720 align:start position:0%
that you gave in regards with Great Bay
 
00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
Farm so if this um this act takes effect
 
00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:15.720 align:start position:0%
60 days just because some of these
 
00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:17.820 align:start position:0%
things take a very long time to see
 
00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:20.940 align:start position:0%
fruition is there any opportunity for
 
00:20:23.029 --> 00:20:23.039 align:start position:0%
the state to get involved in this one
 
00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
that you said that you gave it as an
 
00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:26.210 align:start position:0%
that you said that you gave it as an
example

00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:26.220 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:20:28.669 --> 00:20:28.679 align:start position:0%
um no that money is all closed all done
 
00:20:30.409 --> 00:20:30.419 align:start position:0%
okay they're just down to survey work
 
00:20:33.169 --> 00:20:33.179 align:start position:0%
right now gotcha
 
00:20:36.409 --> 00:20:36.419 align:start position:0%
is there anything else that's what this
 
00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
could affect that's in the works no I
 
00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:40.190 align:start position:0%
could affect that's in the works no I
think

00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:40.200 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:20:42.049 --> 00:20:42.059 align:start position:0%
if we get get there I've still got to
 
00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:45.720 align:start position:0%
update the rules and and get there so
 
00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
um I don't think so but under the state
 
00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:49.880 align:start position:0%
law right now we do have money available
 
00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:52.440 align:start position:0%
so potentially we could still be acting
 
00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
by ourselves and we could do that
 
00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:56.460 align:start position:0%
afterwards this isn't this is a either
 
00:20:58.789 --> 00:20:58.799 align:start position:0%
or situation
 
00:20:58.799 --> 00:20:59.990 align:start position:0%
or situation
okay

00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:02.340 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:03.900 align:start position:0%
do I see any other questions
 
00:21:07.549 --> 00:21:07.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:13.909 --> 00:21:13.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
some land in our town that's held by the
 
00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:16.860 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture and easement
 
00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
and I don't know that I've ever seen a
 
00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:20.580 align:start position:0%
monitoring report so I'm just do you
 
00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
have a or do you usually Outsource it
 
00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:25.250 align:start position:0%
have a or do you usually Outsource it
anyhow

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:25.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:27.409 --> 00:21:27.419 align:start position:0%
um inspectors from the Department of
 
00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
regulatory services our requirement is
 
00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:33.480 align:start position:0%
to inspect it every two years reports
 
00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:35.000 align:start position:0%
are made
 
00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:37.380 align:start position:0%
I only see them if there's a problem
 
00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
quite frankly
 
00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:41.940 align:start position:0%
um and I know we
 
00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:43.500 align:start position:0%
I think we do work with some other
 
00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:46.860 align:start position:0%
agencies I got obvious honestly don't
 
00:21:48.649 --> 00:21:48.659 align:start position:0%
think we we don't pay anybody anything
 
00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:51.720 align:start position:0%
to do it but I need to look into that a
 
00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:53.340 align:start position:0%
little bit a little bit more but the
 
00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:55.740 align:start position:0%
monitoring is done to the best of our
 
00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
ability and I'm not going to tell you
 
00:21:59.390 --> 00:21:59.400 align:start position:0%
I'm satisfied with everything there's
 
00:22:01.549 --> 00:22:01.559 align:start position:0%
one piece of property that I recently
 
00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:04.020 align:start position:0%
spoken to the developer the director
 
00:22:06.049 --> 00:22:06.059 align:start position:0%
about that we need to step out in
 
00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
enforcement on that it's just
 
00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
becoming very trashy
 
00:22:15.529 --> 00:22:15.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
thank you uh I don't see any other pink
 
00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
cards are there any other folks who are
 
00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:25.140 align:start position:0%
interested in uh testifying on this bill
 
00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you Mr commissioner
 
00:22:30.169 --> 00:22:30.179 align:start position:0%
we appreciate your input and uh
 
00:22:33.049 --> 00:22:33.059 align:start position:0%
I would like to remind members of the
 
00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:34.740 align:start position:0%
committee that if you have a follow-up
 
00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:38.100 align:start position:0%
question you need to ask for a follow-up
 
00:22:40.909 --> 00:22:40.919 align:start position:0%
question and we don't want to get into a
 
00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:43.980 align:start position:0%
situation of back and forth conversation
 
00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:46.310 align:start position:0%
situation of back and forth conversation
so

00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:52.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
with that I'm going to close this commit
 
00:23:00.649 --> 00:23:00.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:37.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:41.570 --> 00:23:41.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
so we will uh begin a hearing I will
 
00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:47.700 align:start position:0%
open the hearing on HB 138 relative to
 
00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:49.740 align:start position:0%
the oversight of the commissioner of the
 
00:23:51.289 --> 00:23:51.299 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture markets and
 
00:23:51.299 --> 00:23:52.490 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture markets and
food

00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:52.500 align:start position:0%
food
 
00:23:59.230 --> 00:23:59.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:03.620 align:start position:0%
is representative Bixby thank you so um
 
00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:07.320 align:start position:0%
uh HP 138 is another department request
 
00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:08.930 align:start position:0%
uh HP 138 is another department request
and

00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:08.940 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:11.340 align:start position:0%
I've just handed out a double-sided
 
00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
piece of testimony
 
00:24:18.049 --> 00:24:18.059 align:start position:0%
um and that that is uh simply because uh
 
00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:20.460 align:start position:0%
there are the text of the bill simply
 
00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:23.100 align:start position:0%
says repeal this line repeal this line
 
00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:25.380 align:start position:0%
and repeal this line and I thought it
 
00:24:27.169 --> 00:24:27.179 align:start position:0%
would be a little it would be convenient
 
00:24:29.149 --> 00:24:29.159 align:start position:0%
for people to know what those what was
 
00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
in those lines
 
00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:32.580 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:24:34.789 --> 00:24:34.799 align:start position:0%
there are basically two things that are
 
00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:38.340 align:start position:0%
being repealed by this bill one is the
 
00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:39.529 align:start position:0%
being repealed by this bill one is the
um

00:24:39.529 --> 00:24:39.539 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:42.289 --> 00:24:42.299 align:start position:0%
uh one is the oversight of the
 
00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner of uh the Department of
 
00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
Agriculture for uh clerical staff for
 
00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:51.260 align:start position:0%
the State Board of veterinary medicine
 
00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh a couple years back the State Board
 
00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
of veterinary medicine got moved from
 
00:24:58.850 --> 00:24:58.860 align:start position:0%
the Department of Agriculture to the
 
00:25:00.649 --> 00:25:00.659 align:start position:0%
office of
 
00:25:04.789 --> 00:25:04.799 align:start position:0%
um professional licensure and
 
00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:07.620 align:start position:0%
uh and so all of its functions are now
 
00:25:09.529 --> 00:25:09.539 align:start position:0%
over there there are no staff in the
 
00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
department uh for the board of
 
00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:13.620 align:start position:0%
veterinary medicine and there never will
 
00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:16.860 align:start position:0%
be again so uh this line is sort of an
 
00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
orphan uh and just should go away
 
00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:23.340 align:start position:0%
um the uh second thing that's being
 
00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:27.720 align:start position:0%
repealed is uh in the past there uh New
 
00:25:30.909 --> 00:25:30.919 align:start position:0%
Hampshire had quarantine facilities for
 
00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:35.460 align:start position:0%
equines uh to make sure that they didn't
 
00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:38.840 align:start position:0%
have a disease called equine
 
00:25:43.090 --> 00:25:43.100 align:start position:0%
contagious equine meritritis or cem
 
00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:46.760 align:start position:0%
and metritis not meritris metroiditis
 
00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:48.669 align:start position:0%
and metritis not meritris metroiditis
and

00:25:48.669 --> 00:25:48.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
the state no longer has any of those
 
00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:53.400 align:start position:0%
facilities it is unlikely that we will
 
00:25:55.669 --> 00:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
get a facility because regions don't
 
00:25:58.430 --> 00:25:58.440 align:start position:0%
need that many of them and
 
00:25:58.440 --> 00:25:59.090 align:start position:0%
need that many of them and
um

00:25:59.090 --> 00:25:59.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:01.909 --> 00:26:01.919 align:start position:0%
and there are others in the new in the
 
00:26:03.769 --> 00:26:03.779 align:start position:0%
New England or the northeastern region
 
00:26:07.390 --> 00:26:07.400 align:start position:0%
that um horse owners have and horse pony
 
00:26:11.149 --> 00:26:11.159 align:start position:0%
mule owners have access to so
 
00:26:11.159 --> 00:26:12.070 align:start position:0%
mule owners have access to so
um

00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
uh so we don't really need to have the
 
00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
uh regulations for one of these
 
00:26:20.029 --> 00:26:20.039 align:start position:0%
facilities since we're not going to have
 
00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:22.380 align:start position:0%
we don't have one and we won't have one
 
00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
at any point in the foreseeable future
 
00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:28.200 align:start position:0%
uh there is also a a
 
00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:29.029 align:start position:0%
uh there is also a a
um

00:26:29.029 --> 00:26:29.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:32.269 --> 00:26:32.279 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund which uh provided the
 
00:26:35.029 --> 00:26:35.039 align:start position:0%
money for dealing with those facilities
 
00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:39.240 align:start position:0%
and that fund is also uh being removed
 
00:26:42.289 --> 00:26:42.299 align:start position:0%
needs to be removed from law so
 
00:26:42.299 --> 00:26:42.950 align:start position:0%
needs to be removed from law so
um

00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:45.529 --> 00:26:45.539 align:start position:0%
that is basically what this bill does
 
00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:47.880 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to take brief questions
 
00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
but I will probably pass most of them on
 
00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:55.020 align:start position:0%
to the commissioner or to the State Vet
 
00:26:57.529 --> 00:26:57.539 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Bixby do I see
 
00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
any questions for representative Bixby
 
00:27:03.169 --> 00:27:03.179 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:05.220 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your introduction and
 
00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
testimony to this bill
 
00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
thank you and I would like to Now call
 
00:27:12.289 --> 00:27:12.299 align:start position:0%
uh Steve Crawford from Department of
 
00:27:12.299 --> 00:27:16.789 align:start position:0%
uh Steve Crawford from Department of
Agriculture

00:27:16.789 --> 00:27:16.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
good morning Madam chair good morning
 
00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:20.400 align:start position:0%
committee good morning Steve Crawford
 
00:27:21.769 --> 00:27:21.779 align:start position:0%
State veterinarian New Hampshire
 
00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture and thank you
 
00:27:25.789 --> 00:27:25.799 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby for bringing this
 
00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:31.260 align:start position:0%
forward for us uh Department supports uh
 
00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
all three sections being repealed
 
00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:34.730 align:start position:0%
all three sections being repealed
um

00:27:34.730 --> 00:27:34.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:36.169 --> 00:27:36.179 align:start position:0%
as you heard the veterinary board was
 
00:27:39.529 --> 00:27:39.539 align:start position:0%
moved from from our department to oplc
 
00:27:42.649 --> 00:27:42.659 align:start position:0%
several years ago and runs more
 
00:27:44.029 --> 00:27:44.039 align:start position:0%
efficiently there than it did with us we
 
00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
never had the bodies to do it
 
00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:49.980 align:start position:0%
uh the two pieces regarding cem so cem
 
00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:51.960 align:start position:0%
is an internationally regulated disease
 
00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
any animals coming in from cem-positive
 
00:27:56.330 --> 00:27:56.340 align:start position:0%
countries would have to go to a
 
00:27:58.070 --> 00:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
quarantine station for 28 days before
 
00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
being released
 
00:28:02.149 --> 00:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
we had have had two of these
 
00:28:03.529 --> 00:28:03.539 align:start position:0%
historically in the state the most
 
00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
recent closed about 15 years ago and so
 
00:28:07.549 --> 00:28:07.559 align:start position:0%
this has been in statute and we maintain
 
00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
a dedicated fund because we had to
 
00:28:11.450 --> 00:28:11.460 align:start position:0%
collect fees from them uh
 
00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:13.620 align:start position:0%
there are two active cem facilities in
 
00:28:15.289 --> 00:28:15.299 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island and one in Newburgh New
 
00:28:16.549 --> 00:28:16.559 align:start position:0%
York about four hours away so three
 
00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
opportunities within about four hours
 
00:28:21.049 --> 00:28:21.059 align:start position:0%
for internationally moved horses the two
 
00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:22.260 align:start position:0%
in Rhode Island always almost always
 
00:28:24.049 --> 00:28:24.059 align:start position:0%
have capacity so there is room in New
 
00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:25.320 align:start position:0%
England if people wanted to Avail
 
00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:26.700 align:start position:0%
themselves of this I don't think it's
 
00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:28.200 align:start position:0%
necessary anymore for the Department to
 
00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
maintain that bit of Statute or a
 
00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund that we never touch
 
00:28:35.269 --> 00:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
with that I'll have to answer questions
 
00:28:38.149 --> 00:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions
 
00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:40.440 align:start position:0%
representative Murray
 
00:28:42.049 --> 00:28:42.059 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
results of Coggins tests do they still
 
00:28:50.810 --> 00:28:50.820 align:start position:0%
come to you with any information or
 
00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:53.940 align:start position:0%
regarding cem uh for the quarantine
 
00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:55.130 align:start position:0%
regarding cem uh for the quarantine
results

00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:55.140 align:start position:0%
results
 
00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
for international travel or Interstate
 
00:28:59.870 --> 00:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
travel so yeah so the Coggins test is
 
00:29:01.909 --> 00:29:01.919 align:start position:0%
for equine infectious anemia and this is
 
00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:04.380 align:start position:0%
for cem so two different diseases the
 
00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
cem test results
 
00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
we we wouldn't get and we don't get
 
00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:10.140 align:start position:0%
because we don't have a quarantine
 
00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
facility all of the Coggins tester eia
 
00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:14.220 align:start position:0%
tests both for horses from New Hampshire
 
00:29:15.529 --> 00:29:15.539 align:start position:0%
leaving here
 
00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:17.700 align:start position:0%
well I assume say both so for horses
 
00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire leaving here we get
 
00:29:21.049 --> 00:29:21.059 align:start position:0%
those for horses from other states
 
00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:24.240 align:start position:0%
coming here we get those and then any
 
00:29:25.909 --> 00:29:25.919 align:start position:0%
for horses tested at our New Hampshire
 
00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:28.140 align:start position:0%
veterinary Diagnostic lab regardless of
 
00:29:29.029 --> 00:29:29.039 align:start position:0%
whether or not they're coming or going
 
00:29:30.289 --> 00:29:30.299 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire we get those two so
 
00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
we see 16 000 some results a year
 
00:29:38.389 --> 00:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:40.730 --> 00:29:40.740 align:start position:0%
relative then to the cem test results if
 
00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
there is a question or a need would you
 
00:29:44.389 --> 00:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
then refer them just back to the office
 
00:29:46.549 --> 00:29:46.559 align:start position:0%
of the professional relationship or some
 
00:29:48.529 --> 00:29:48.539 align:start position:0%
other facility
 
00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
so if um and I'm going to try and
 
00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:52.440 align:start position:0%
rephrase your question to make sure I
 
00:29:53.529 --> 00:29:53.539 align:start position:0%
understand it
 
00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:56.460 align:start position:0%
so if a horse owner contacted us
 
00:29:58.970 --> 00:29:58.980 align:start position:0%
interested in cem quarantine where would
 
00:30:00.769 --> 00:30:00.779 align:start position:0%
we send them okay correct thank you got
 
00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:04.020 align:start position:0%
it sure so cem oversight is a joint
 
00:30:06.529 --> 00:30:06.539 align:start position:0%
State and federally managed program we
 
00:30:08.389 --> 00:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
would likely if they wanted a facility
 
00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:10.020 align:start position:0%
name we'd refer them to one of the two
 
00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
in Rhode Island if they wanted had
 
00:30:13.370 --> 00:30:13.380 align:start position:0%
questions about where
 
00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:16.980 align:start position:0%
or details we'd refer them to USDA
 
00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:21.889 align:start position:0%
or details we'd refer them to USDA
sure

00:30:21.889 --> 00:30:21.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:23.940 align:start position:0%
um I see a question from representative
 
00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:24.830 align:start position:0%
um I see a question from representative
smart

00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
smart
 
00:30:27.409 --> 00:30:27.419 align:start position:0%
I think so thank you madam chair
 
00:30:27.419 --> 00:30:28.070 align:start position:0%
I think so thank you madam chair
um

00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:32.029 --> 00:30:32.039 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering about uh when I had horses
 
00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
if I was going to show or anything I had
 
00:30:36.169 --> 00:30:36.179 align:start position:0%
to test them before they went before
 
00:30:37.970 --> 00:30:37.980 align:start position:0%
they left my property
 
00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:40.440 align:start position:0%
do we not test horses that are coming
 
00:30:42.889 --> 00:30:42.899 align:start position:0%
from overseas before they come rather
 
00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:44.940 align:start position:0%
than bringing the disease and even
 
00:30:46.669 --> 00:30:46.679 align:start position:0%
though it's quarantined
 
00:30:48.769 --> 00:30:48.779 align:start position:0%
there's only so much quarantine you can
 
00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:51.000 align:start position:0%
do you can't stop flies you can't stop
 
00:30:54.289 --> 00:30:54.299 align:start position:0%
mosquitoes so what what
 
00:30:58.130 --> 00:30:58.140 align:start position:0%
do we not do that I guess is my question
 
00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:01.620 align:start position:0%
and why uh
 
00:31:04.010 --> 00:31:04.020 align:start position:0%
I don't know is the short answer because
 
00:31:06.049 --> 00:31:06.059 align:start position:0%
I haven't kept up on cem regulations
 
00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
because we haven't had the facility in a
 
00:31:08.810 --> 00:31:08.820 align:start position:0%
long time
 
00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
yes there is an awful lot of
 
00:31:13.250 --> 00:31:13.260 align:start position:0%
pre-movement testing required to enter
 
00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
the United States but these are federal
 
00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:17.220 align:start position:0%
regulations for importation into the
 
00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:17.889 align:start position:0%
regulations for importation into the
country

00:31:17.889 --> 00:31:17.899 align:start position:0%
country
 
00:31:20.090 --> 00:31:20.100 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure why they don't require
 
00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:21.720 align:start position:0%
this testing but they do require other
 
00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
testing before coming in
 
00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:26.340 align:start position:0%
so they so these are CM facilities are
 
00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:28.980 align:start position:0%
jointly federally and state managed so
 
00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
USDA has to be involved in that
 
00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:32.230 align:start position:0%
USDA has to be involved in that
management

00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:32.240 align:start position:0%
management
 
00:31:35.389 --> 00:31:35.399 align:start position:0%
for to your example for horses leaving
 
00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
your farm to go to a show or across
 
00:31:38.510 --> 00:31:38.520 align:start position:0%
state lines those still have to be
 
00:31:40.490 --> 00:31:40.500 align:start position:0%
generally Coggins tested and other stuff
 
00:31:42.889 --> 00:31:42.899 align:start position:0%
before they would leave your farm
 
00:31:45.049 --> 00:31:45.059 align:start position:0%
probably some politics playing into why
 
00:31:46.610 --> 00:31:46.620 align:start position:0%
some some diseases are required before
 
00:31:49.130 --> 00:31:49.140 align:start position:0%
and some after entry for testing but I
 
00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:54.360 align:start position:0%
it doesn't look like you're I'm happy to
 
00:31:55.610 --> 00:31:55.620 align:start position:0%
try and dig up more for you but I just
 
00:31:59.149 --> 00:31:59.159 align:start position:0%
don't know unfortunately sure
 
00:32:01.130 --> 00:32:01.140 align:start position:0%
and I have a question
 
00:32:04.909 --> 00:32:04.919 align:start position:0%
um so we have a cem fund now is there
 
00:32:07.370 --> 00:32:07.380 align:start position:0%
any funds is there any money in it and
 
00:32:09.950 --> 00:32:09.960 align:start position:0%
if not if there is what happens to it if
 
00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
there is not the fund just goes away
 
00:32:14.450 --> 00:32:14.460 align:start position:0%
correct with this Bill yes
 
00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
um yes there is money in it because we
 
00:32:17.690 --> 00:32:17.700 align:start position:0%
have to maintain a dollar to keep an
 
00:32:19.789 --> 00:32:19.799 align:start position:0%
account open I believe there's a dollar
 
00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:22.200 align:start position:0%
in it but I don't know that now it's
 
00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:28.860 align:start position:0%
um what happens to that money I would
 
00:32:29.930 --> 00:32:29.940 align:start position:0%
defer to the commission about my guess
 
00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
it would probably go back to the general
 
00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:35.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:41.100 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much I
 
00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:43.020 align:start position:0%
appreciate your testimony this morning
 
00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:45.720 align:start position:0%
happy to do it uh we have no other pink
 
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
cards is there anybody else who wishes
 
00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:52.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:55.610 --> 00:32:55.620 align:start position:0%
nope seeing none I will close the
 
00:33:04.909 --> 00:33:04.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:04.919 --> 00:33:06.769 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:33:06.769 --> 00:33:06.779 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:17.100 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:18.950 align:start position:0%
all right
um

00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:22.009 --> 00:33:22.019 align:start position:0%
we're just shy of a minute here
 
00:33:24.169 --> 00:33:24.179 align:start position:0%
take our breath for uh
 
00:33:34.450 --> 00:33:34.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:36.889 --> 00:33:36.899 align:start position:0%
well this is the last
 
00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:39.720 align:start position:0%
what do we do with these women that's
 
00:33:40.730 --> 00:33:40.740 align:start position:0%
when we start
 
00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:44.330 align:start position:0%
when we start
um

00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:44.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:51.490 --> 00:33:51.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:54.769 --> 00:33:54.779 align:start position:0%
my apologies I uh I did not receive the
 
00:33:58.250 --> 00:33:58.260 align:start position:0%
blue sheets for uh the two bills that we
 
00:34:02.389 --> 00:34:02.399 align:start position:0%
had heard this morning uh for HB 221
 
00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:04.860 align:start position:0%
there was one pro
 
00:34:09.430 --> 00:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
no cons listed on the blue sheet for
 
00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
hb138 we had one pro and no cons
 
00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:16.740 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:34:19.490 --> 00:34:19.500 align:start position:0%
it is 10 30. we are right on schedule
 
00:34:22.149 --> 00:34:22.159 align:start position:0%
and I would like to now open a hearing
 
00:34:25.869 --> 00:34:25.879 align:start position:0%
excuse me open the hearing for hb152
 
00:34:29.930 --> 00:34:29.940 align:start position:0%
relative to soil and plant additives
 
00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:33.540 align:start position:0%
and our person to introduce this bill
 
00:34:36.109 --> 00:34:36.119 align:start position:0%
again is representative Bixby
 
00:34:37.609 --> 00:34:37.619 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:40.200 align:start position:0%
um and for the record I should have said
 
00:34:42.349 --> 00:34:42.359 align:start position:0%
this before the other two and I'd just
 
00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:44.280 align:start position:0%
remembering now I'm representative Peter
 
00:34:46.210 --> 00:34:46.220 align:start position:0%
Bixby representing Dover New Hampshire
 
00:34:51.169 --> 00:34:51.179 align:start position:0%
uh or a fraction thereof and
 
00:34:51.179 --> 00:34:51.950 align:start position:0%
uh or a fraction thereof and
um

00:34:51.950 --> 00:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
so HP 152 is a result of a study
 
00:34:58.250 --> 00:34:58.260 align:start position:0%
committee a study committee last term
 
00:35:03.170 --> 00:35:03.180 align:start position:0%
looking at RSA chapter 431 soil uh which
 
00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
covers soil conditioners and I sponsored
 
00:35:09.349 --> 00:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
the study committee bill because uh I
 
00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:11.880 align:start position:0%
previously had a experience uh looking
 
00:35:13.970 --> 00:35:13.980 align:start position:0%
at it when I was doing
 
00:35:16.010 --> 00:35:16.020 align:start position:0%
um working on a couple of other bills
 
00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
and I noticed that there were some
 
00:35:19.970 --> 00:35:19.980 align:start position:0%
potential problems with the chapter and
 
00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:22.200 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we do
 
00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:22.790 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we do
um

00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
as as part of our committee is we will
 
00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:28.740 align:start position:0%
occasionally review chapters of law that
 
00:35:30.349 --> 00:35:30.359 align:start position:0%
haven't been dealt with for a while to
 
00:35:32.089 --> 00:35:32.099 align:start position:0%
make sure that everything is up to date
 
00:35:34.849 --> 00:35:34.859 align:start position:0%
and still working uh and usually we find
 
00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:36.540 align:start position:0%
a few things that aren't up to date or
 
00:35:39.290 --> 00:35:39.300 align:start position:0%
aren't working and uh then we put in
 
00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
legislation to fix it and that that's
 
00:35:43.069 --> 00:35:43.079 align:start position:0%
what this bill is
 
00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:46.020 align:start position:0%
um and we identified
 
00:35:47.290 --> 00:35:47.300 align:start position:0%
um several
 
00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:50.280 align:start position:0%
categories of issues one has has to do
 
00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
with essentially nuts and bolts issue
 
00:35:55.010 --> 00:35:55.020 align:start position:0%
which is issues which is this bill
 
00:35:56.569 --> 00:35:56.579 align:start position:0%
um there's another bill that has to do
 
00:35:59.210 --> 00:35:59.220 align:start position:0%
with uh the way that
 
00:35:59.220 --> 00:35:59.990 align:start position:0%
with uh the way that
um

00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:04.069 --> 00:36:04.079 align:start position:0%
uh the way that uh some of the funds are
 
00:36:07.069 --> 00:36:07.079 align:start position:0%
handled uh uh the fees the fee revenues
 
00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:09.000 align:start position:0%
are handled and we'll be hearing that
 
00:36:12.410 --> 00:36:12.420 align:start position:0%
probably next week uh and there's also
 
00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:15.240 align:start position:0%
another bill that has to do with some uh
 
00:36:18.170 --> 00:36:18.180 align:start position:0%
I.T weaknesses that were uh brought up
 
00:36:21.589 --> 00:36:21.599 align:start position:0%
in our hearings that uh and
 
00:36:21.599 --> 00:36:22.370 align:start position:0%
in our hearings that uh and
um

00:36:22.370 --> 00:36:22.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:26.040 align:start position:0%
how to handle uh data issues and uh
 
00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:28.020 align:start position:0%
that's going to be appearing at the in
 
00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
in Eda e DNA tomorrow uh but this bill
 
00:36:34.730 --> 00:36:34.740 align:start position:0%
is basically just a nuts and bolts bill
 
00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:37.069 align:start position:0%
is basically just a nuts and bolts bill
so

00:36:37.069 --> 00:36:37.079 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:40.640 align:start position:0%
director Wyman from the Department of
 
00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
Agriculture was very helpful in
 
00:36:44.569 --> 00:36:44.579 align:start position:0%
explaining how a lot of labeling and
 
00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:47.820 align:start position:0%
definitions used in this chapter are
 
00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
drawn from recommendations from the
 
00:36:51.410 --> 00:36:51.420 align:start position:0%
American the association of American
 
00:36:54.770 --> 00:36:54.780 align:start position:0%
Plant Food control officials
 
00:36:56.589 --> 00:36:56.599 align:start position:0%
um or APCO
 
00:36:59.089 --> 00:36:59.099 align:start position:0%
that's a National Organization that
 
00:37:01.310 --> 00:37:01.320 align:start position:0%
creates model definitions and rules so
 
00:37:03.109 --> 00:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
that all states could basically be on
 
00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:05.640 align:start position:0%
the same playing field uh when they're
 
00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:08.820 align:start position:0%
defining uh requirements for labeling
 
00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
and content of uh of plant food
 
00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:16.140 align:start position:0%
materials uh fertilizers lime Etc
 
00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:16.790 align:start position:0%
materials uh fertilizers lime Etc
um

00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
and while many of the definitions uh in
 
00:37:22.370 --> 00:37:22.380 align:start position:0%
the chapter we were happy to learn are
 
00:37:24.290 --> 00:37:24.300 align:start position:0%
in fact still consistent with everything
 
00:37:26.930 --> 00:37:26.940 align:start position:0%
that Africa suggests uh the chapter
 
00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:29.160 align:start position:0%
title soil conditioners didn't have a
 
00:37:31.849 --> 00:37:31.859 align:start position:0%
standard definition and
 
00:37:33.970 --> 00:37:33.980 align:start position:0%
um it is also not defined in the chapter
 
00:37:37.370 --> 00:37:37.380 align:start position:0%
uh the way that this term is used in the
 
00:37:39.829 --> 00:37:39.839 align:start position:0%
in practice is not really consistent
 
00:37:43.069 --> 00:37:43.079 align:start position:0%
with what the chapter covers uh uh and
 
00:37:45.050 --> 00:37:45.060 align:start position:0%
it's much narrower than what the chapter
 
00:37:47.870 --> 00:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
covers so our first recommendation was
 
00:37:50.770 --> 00:37:50.780 align:start position:0%
is to re retitle the chapter
 
00:37:55.130 --> 00:37:55.140 align:start position:0%
to soil and plant additives and then put
 
00:37:57.470 --> 00:37:57.480 align:start position:0%
a definition into the uh at the
 
00:37:59.390 --> 00:37:59.400 align:start position:0%
beginning of the chapter defining what
 
00:38:02.329 --> 00:38:02.339 align:start position:0%
we mean by that and the definition that
 
00:38:02.339 --> 00:38:03.290 align:start position:0%
we mean by that and the definition that
we

00:38:03.290 --> 00:38:03.300 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:05.160 align:start position:0%
um propose
 
00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:07.260 align:start position:0%
encompasses both what the chapter
 
00:38:10.730 --> 00:38:10.740 align:start position:0%
currently covers and allows for the
 
00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
possibility of laws relating to similar
 
00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:16.440 align:start position:0%
uh substances to be added in the future
 
00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:20.040 align:start position:0%
so that uh if when OLS is looking for a
 
00:38:22.609 --> 00:38:22.619 align:start position:0%
place to put uh some sort of new plant
 
00:38:27.829 --> 00:38:27.839 align:start position:0%
or at or soil additive uh into law uh
 
00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
they will say oh this is the right
 
00:38:31.490 --> 00:38:31.500 align:start position:0%
chapter to do that
 
00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:33.050 align:start position:0%
chapter to do that
um

00:38:33.050 --> 00:38:33.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:35.690 --> 00:38:35.700 align:start position:0%
another issue we identified was related
 
00:38:37.730 --> 00:38:37.740 align:start position:0%
to the tonnage reports that fertilizer
 
00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:39.720 align:start position:0%
manufactures and Distributors need to
 
00:38:42.530 --> 00:38:42.540 align:start position:0%
file twice a year there's a fee that is
 
00:38:45.730 --> 00:38:45.740 align:start position:0%
based on the number of tons that uh
 
00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:50.040 align:start position:0%
fertilizer on distributor sells in a
 
00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
year and uh they're supposed to every
 
00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
six months provide a report on how much
 
00:38:59.930 --> 00:38:59.940 align:start position:0%
they sold and then pay a fee which is a
 
00:39:03.890 --> 00:39:03.900 align:start position:0%
pretty small fee uh on that uh on what
 
00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:05.400 align:start position:0%
they sell
 
00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
um and uh there's a penalty if they fail
 
00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:10.140 align:start position:0%
to submit that report or fail to
 
00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
resubmit the payment and the penalty is
 
00:39:18.650 --> 00:39:18.660 align:start position:0%
so small that it probably is would take
 
00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
more paperwork to actually submit the
 
00:39:24.290 --> 00:39:24.300 align:start position:0%
report than uh the the paperwork would
 
00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
cost more to submit than the penalty so
 
00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
um what this amendment does is it allows
 
00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:33.540 align:start position:0%
the commissioner to set the pen penalty
 
00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
and rules so that it can be kept up to
 
00:39:37.089 --> 00:39:37.099 align:start position:0%
date and
 
00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
provide a little bit more incentive for
 
00:39:44.810 --> 00:39:44.820 align:start position:0%
um for the Distributors to actually
 
00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:45.650 align:start position:0%
um for the Distributors to actually
um

00:39:45.650 --> 00:39:45.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:50.329 --> 00:39:50.339 align:start position:0%
uh submit their reports uh the next
 
00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
issue issue has to do with penalties
 
00:39:54.170 --> 00:39:54.180 align:start position:0%
when a producer sells a product that
 
00:39:57.170 --> 00:39:57.180 align:start position:0%
doesn't meet the label description or
 
00:39:59.510 --> 00:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
the amount description which is referred
 
00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
to as a deficiency
 
00:40:04.010 --> 00:40:04.020 align:start position:0%
so essentially this is this is a
 
00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
situation where a customer is getting
 
00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
shortchanged because what's being sold
 
00:40:11.450 --> 00:40:11.460 align:start position:0%
in the bag or in the uh in the truckload
 
00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
isn't consistent with what they're being
 
00:40:16.450 --> 00:40:16.460 align:start position:0%
told is there
 
00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
and these penalties are paid to the
 
00:40:21.890 --> 00:40:21.900 align:start position:0%
customer who has been shortchanged but
 
00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
current law says this remedy is only
 
00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
available to a customer who is purchased
 
00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:30.180 align:start position:0%
a ton or more and we felt that uh it was
 
00:40:32.810 --> 00:40:32.820 align:start position:0%
really be appropriate for anyone who was
 
00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:35.880 align:start position:0%
shortchanged to be able to be able to
 
00:40:38.210 --> 00:40:38.220 align:start position:0%
get this remedy so
 
00:40:40.430 --> 00:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
um that's basically what this we just
 
00:40:43.609 --> 00:40:43.619 align:start position:0%
eliminate the line that says uh it has
 
00:40:45.050 --> 00:40:45.060 align:start position:0%
to be a ton or more
 
00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:46.609 align:start position:0%
to be a ton or more
uh

00:40:46.609 --> 00:40:46.619 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:40:48.650 --> 00:40:48.660 align:start position:0%
and there was also an issue with how the
 
00:40:50.930 --> 00:40:50.940 align:start position:0%
penalty would be calculated the current
 
00:40:55.069 --> 00:40:55.079 align:start position:0%
system requires the department to uh do
 
00:40:58.069 --> 00:40:58.079 align:start position:0%
a survey of fertilizer manufacturers to
 
00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
figure out what the average cost for
 
00:41:02.089 --> 00:41:02.099 align:start position:0%
each individual component of the
 
00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
fertilizer is and then put together a uh
 
00:41:09.950 --> 00:41:09.960 align:start position:0%
a fee a a price schedule and then
 
00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
publish that schedule and in order to
 
00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
publish the schedule it has to go
 
00:41:15.470 --> 00:41:15.480 align:start position:0%
through the Joint Commission committee
 
00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
on legislative rules uh and uh that
 
00:41:21.890 --> 00:41:21.900 align:start position:0%
means that by the time that the price
 
00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
schedule has been published it is often
 
00:41:26.810 --> 00:41:26.820 align:start position:0%
out of date uh not only is it that but
 
00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:29.700 align:start position:0%
publishing the schedule is kind of a
 
00:41:31.310 --> 00:41:31.320 align:start position:0%
silly amount of busy work
 
00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:32.810 align:start position:0%
silly amount of busy work
so

00:41:32.810 --> 00:41:32.820 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:35.640 align:start position:0%
um what we decided was that the fairest
 
00:41:37.310 --> 00:41:37.320 align:start position:0%
and quickest method of determining the
 
00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:40.200 align:start position:0%
value uh that would that would be used
 
00:41:42.290 --> 00:41:42.300 align:start position:0%
to figure out the penalty would be to
 
00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
actually look at the invoiced price that
 
00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
of the material that uh was deficient
 
00:41:53.690 --> 00:41:53.700 align:start position:0%
and the final issue in the bill deals
 
00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:55.380 align:start position:0%
with a paragraph that should have been
 
00:41:57.349 --> 00:41:57.359 align:start position:0%
written with a sunset Clause back in
 
00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
2013 but wasn't uh and so uh the statute
 
00:42:04.490 --> 00:42:04.500 align:start position:0%
dealing with turf fertilizer standards
 
00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:09.480 align:start position:0%
was passed in 2013 and uh it said so
 
00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:12.180 align:start position:0%
turf fertilizer uh from that point on
 
00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:14.940 align:start position:0%
had to have could only have a certain
 
00:42:17.930 --> 00:42:17.940 align:start position:0%
maximum amount of different nutrients in
 
00:42:19.849 --> 00:42:19.859 align:start position:0%
it and the idea is that you want to
 
00:42:21.530 --> 00:42:21.540 align:start position:0%
minimize you want to restrict the number
 
00:42:23.329 --> 00:42:23.339 align:start position:0%
the amount of nutrients in turf
 
00:42:25.730 --> 00:42:25.740 align:start position:0%
fertilizer to restrict runoff that would
 
00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:29.400 align:start position:0%
get into waterways uh so
 
00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:30.710 align:start position:0%
get into waterways uh so
um

00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:35.810 --> 00:42:35.820 align:start position:0%
so we we passed the law uh specifying
 
00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
maximum amounts of nutrients and turf
 
00:42:42.050 --> 00:42:42.060 align:start position:0%
fertilizers however uh there were some
 
00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:44.940 align:start position:0%
retailers who still have bags of the old
 
00:42:47.710 --> 00:42:47.720 align:start position:0%
fertilizer on the shelves are going into
 
00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:51.240 align:start position:0%
2014 when the bill took effect and we
 
00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
didn't want to penalize the retailers
 
00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:54.720 align:start position:0%
who still had bags of it on their
 
00:42:56.990 --> 00:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
shelves and if they still have bags at
 
00:42:58.430 --> 00:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
the top of their shelves that's a
 
00:43:02.329 --> 00:43:02.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:02.339 --> 00:43:02.990 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:43:02.990 --> 00:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
so we can pretty be pretty sure that
 
00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
stock is completely depleted now and we
 
00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
don't need this this paragraph in law
 
00:43:11.210 --> 00:43:11.220 align:start position:0%
anymore and I'm happy to take any
 
00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:12.770 align:start position:0%
anymore and I'm happy to take any
questions

00:43:12.770 --> 00:43:12.780 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:43:15.290 --> 00:43:15.300 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Bixby do we
 
00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
have questions from the committee
 
00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
representative Knapp
 
00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:21.180 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and maybe this is
 
00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
a question for the commissioner but um
 
00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
is it is it common practice to have the
 
00:43:29.089 --> 00:43:29.099 align:start position:0%
Departments set feed the fee schedule or
 
00:43:32.329 --> 00:43:32.339 align:start position:0%
more common to have it within the RSA
 
00:43:36.710 --> 00:43:36.720 align:start position:0%
it's uh so it depends on the particular
 
00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:40.440 align:start position:0%
situation and uh in when it's a
 
00:43:43.370 --> 00:43:43.380 align:start position:0%
relatively small fee then it is often
 
00:43:47.089 --> 00:43:47.099 align:start position:0%
set by the set by a department uh any
 
00:43:49.370 --> 00:43:49.380 align:start position:0%
fee that is set by Department in rules
 
00:43:52.490 --> 00:43:52.500 align:start position:0%
has to be approved by the joint
 
00:43:54.370 --> 00:43:54.380 align:start position:0%
committee on legislative Administration
 
00:43:57.950 --> 00:43:57.960 align:start position:0%
uh which and what that commonly called
 
00:44:00.650 --> 00:44:00.660 align:start position:0%
gel car and what gel car does is it
 
00:44:04.069 --> 00:44:04.079 align:start position:0%
basically looks at rules that are
 
00:44:07.010 --> 00:44:07.020 align:start position:0%
promulgated by departments and uh before
 
00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:09.240 align:start position:0%
they get and before they can be you know
 
00:44:12.290 --> 00:44:12.300 align:start position:0%
fully implemented gel car has to say yes
 
00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
this rule is consistent with the
 
00:44:17.990 --> 00:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
legislative intent of the statutes so
 
00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
um basically any time of any time a fee
 
00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
is set in rule it does have legislative
 
00:44:25.849 --> 00:44:25.859 align:start position:0%
oversight in order to make sure that it
 
00:44:30.530 --> 00:44:30.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:32.329 --> 00:44:32.339 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:44:34.490 --> 00:44:34.500 align:start position:0%
um I have a question about
 
00:44:37.309 --> 00:44:37.319 align:start position:0%
uh the section three
 
00:44:40.309 --> 00:44:40.319 align:start position:0%
uh line 19.
 
00:44:43.490 --> 00:44:43.500 align:start position:0%
it says that established by the
 
00:44:45.470 --> 00:44:45.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner in rules adopted pursuant
 
00:44:50.230 --> 00:44:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:54.109 --> 00:44:54.119 align:start position:0%
541-a has got many many sections to it
 
00:44:56.329 --> 00:44:56.339 align:start position:0%
did you want to
 
00:44:59.109 --> 00:44:59.119 align:start position:0%
refer to any particular
 
00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
section or is this just the entire
 
00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
administrative procedure act that you're
 
00:45:07.609 --> 00:45:07.619 align:start position:0%
referring to okay so that is pretty much
 
00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
boilerplate language for any time that
 
00:45:12.650 --> 00:45:12.660 align:start position:0%
you're asking for something to be a
 
00:45:15.069 --> 00:45:15.079 align:start position:0%
department to be able to establish rules
 
00:45:19.970 --> 00:45:19.980 align:start position:0%
uh what what RSA 541a as a whole does is
 
00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
it uh basically sets lays the ground
 
00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:27.540 align:start position:0%
rules for uh for right for departments
 
00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
writing rules so
 
00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
um so so basically any part of 541a that
 
00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
is relevant to setting these rules
 
00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:39.780 align:start position:0%
should be needs to be
 
00:45:41.630 --> 00:45:41.640 align:start position:0%
um they need to be consistent with that
 
00:45:44.569 --> 00:45:44.579 align:start position:0%
thank you for that explanation
 
00:45:46.250 --> 00:45:46.260 align:start position:0%
representative Murray
 
00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
you madam chair for taking my question I
 
00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:57.050 --> 00:45:57.060 align:start position:0%
I might know the answer uh that's fine
 
00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
position of the fertilizers
 
00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:11.400 align:start position:0%
so my question would be that in the
 
00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
event that I'm curious to know if there
 
00:46:15.829 --> 00:46:15.839 align:start position:0%
is a requirement to list what is in the
 
00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
fertilizer that could be potential
 
00:46:19.309 --> 00:46:19.319 align:start position:0%
contaminants like pfas or anything else
 
00:46:22.970 --> 00:46:22.980 align:start position:0%
and if so are those listed on
 
00:46:25.210 --> 00:46:25.220 align:start position:0%
bags of fertilizer currently
 
00:46:29.150 --> 00:46:29.160 align:start position:0%
uh I think that I'm I'm gonna guess that
 
00:46:30.890 --> 00:46:30.900 align:start position:0%
director Wyman is going to be coming up
 
00:46:35.210 --> 00:46:35.220 align:start position:0%
to uh uh either director Wyman or the or
 
00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
the commissioner and uh he can probably
 
00:46:40.730 --> 00:46:40.740 align:start position:0%
ask answer that more specifically I know
 
00:46:43.010 --> 00:46:43.020 align:start position:0%
that the answer for for pesticides is
 
00:46:44.930 --> 00:46:44.940 align:start position:0%
they don't need to be declared but I
 
00:46:47.870 --> 00:46:47.880 align:start position:0%
don't know uh what what the inert
 
00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
ingredient requirements are in
 
00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:51.829 align:start position:0%
ingredient requirements are in
fertilizer

00:46:51.829 --> 00:46:51.839 align:start position:0%
fertilizer
 
00:46:54.829 --> 00:46:54.839 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:46:57.890 --> 00:46:57.900 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Bixby I do I
 
00:47:00.589 --> 00:47:00.599 align:start position:0%
see any other questions no and I do not
 
00:47:03.829 --> 00:47:03.839 align:start position:0%
have any other pink cards so uh okay we
 
00:47:11.569 --> 00:47:11.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:12.530 --> 00:47:12.540 align:start position:0%
can I say
 
00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:24.770 --> 00:47:24.780 align:start position:0%
so I have here on Deck uh Alan Wyman
 
00:47:27.650 --> 00:47:27.660 align:start position:0%
I invite you up to uh
 
00:47:33.829 --> 00:47:33.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:36.109 --> 00:47:36.119 align:start position:0%
thank you my name is Alan Wyman I am the
 
00:47:39.290 --> 00:47:39.300 align:start position:0%
director of regulatory Services uh under
 
00:47:42.410 --> 00:47:42.420 align:start position:0%
which this bill would be relevant and
 
00:47:45.890 --> 00:47:45.900 align:start position:0%
specific to the question there is no uh
 
00:47:48.770 --> 00:47:48.780 align:start position:0%
requirement to list uh
 
00:47:51.470 --> 00:47:51.480 align:start position:0%
contaminants such as pfaster lead or
 
00:47:54.829 --> 00:47:54.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:57.170 --> 00:47:57.180 align:start position:0%
let me see
 
00:48:00.650 --> 00:48:00.660 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions to
 
00:48:04.970 --> 00:48:04.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:10.970 --> 00:48:10.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:14.450 --> 00:48:14.460 align:start position:0%
and I have no more pink cards for a
 
00:48:16.430 --> 00:48:16.440 align:start position:0%
testimony for this bill if anybody else
 
00:48:19.849 --> 00:48:19.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:19.859 --> 00:48:24.650 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:48:24.650 --> 00:48:24.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:27.290 align:start position:0%
we have
um

00:48:27.290 --> 00:48:27.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:30.890 --> 00:48:30.900 align:start position:0%
on our blue sheet we have one person who
 
00:48:34.970 --> 00:48:34.980 align:start position:0%
is written against this legislation and
 
00:48:37.849 --> 00:48:37.859 align:start position:0%
we had one person who submitted
 
00:48:41.150 --> 00:48:41.160 align:start position:0%
testimony online or or not submitted
 
00:48:43.130 --> 00:48:43.140 align:start position:0%
testimony but signed up online to
 
00:48:44.990 --> 00:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
support this bill
 
00:48:47.329 --> 00:48:47.339 align:start position:0%
and with that I will close the hearing
 
00:48:47.339 --> 00:48:48.530 align:start position:0%
and with that I will close the hearing
on

00:48:48.530 --> 00:48:48.540 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:48:52.309 --> 00:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:54.170 --> 00:48:54.180 align:start position:0%
and we are
 
00:48:56.750 --> 00:48:56.760 align:start position:0%
15 minutes ahead of schedule so I'm
 
00:48:59.210 --> 00:48:59.220 align:start position:0%
going to call a break a little recess
 
00:49:01.849 --> 00:49:01.859 align:start position:0%
for the committee and we will get back
 
01:04:13.150 --> 01:04:13.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:17.569 --> 01:04:17.579 align:start position:0%
okay everybody it is now 11 o'clock
 
01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
and I am going to open up the hearing

for HB 79
 
01:04:26.150 --> 01:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
and I will introduce representative
 
01:04:29.809 --> 01:04:29.819 align:start position:0%
Aiken Ankerberg for uh him to introduce
 
01:04:31.549 --> 01:04:31.559 align:start position:0%
this bill to us
 
01:04:34.789 --> 01:04:34.799 align:start position:0%
good morning representative Ankerberg
 
01:04:36.549 --> 01:04:36.559 align:start position:0%
good morning Madam chair
 
01:04:39.170 --> 01:04:39.180 align:start position:0%
for the record in Ankerberg I represent
 
01:04:42.049 --> 01:04:42.059 align:start position:0%
Stratford District 10. that's the lovely
 
01:04:44.870 --> 01:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
people in the Lilac City of Rochester
 
01:04:46.190 --> 01:04:46.200 align:start position:0%
um so I'm here this morning to present
 
01:04:49.430 --> 01:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
House Bill 79 as you see I've handed out
 
01:04:52.069 --> 01:04:52.079 align:start position:0%
amendments to that bill which I'm hoping
 
01:04:54.470 --> 01:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
you'll consider and what this amendment
 
01:04:56.450 --> 01:04:56.460 align:start position:0%
does is actually strip out the language
 
01:04:57.849 --> 01:04:57.859 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
01:05:01.130 --> 01:05:01.140 align:start position:0%
and go towards the intent of what we
 
01:05:02.809 --> 01:05:02.819 align:start position:0%
were trying to do here which dealt with
 
01:05:05.109 --> 01:05:05.119 align:start position:0%
the section that you'll see stripped out
 
01:05:07.789 --> 01:05:07.799 align:start position:0%
and constituent brought this to my
 
01:05:11.690 --> 01:05:11.700 align:start position:0%
attention some ambiguous language in in
 
01:05:14.210 --> 01:05:14.220 align:start position:0%
this section referring to reasonable
 
01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:15.370 align:start position:0%
this section referring to reasonable
hours

01:05:15.370 --> 01:05:15.380 align:start position:0%
hours
 
01:05:20.390 --> 01:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
so I asked uh commissioner Jasper if he
 
01:05:22.309 --> 01:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
would be willing to Define that in
 
01:05:26.150 --> 01:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
statute what reasonable hours are and he
 
01:05:28.490 --> 01:05:28.500 align:start position:0%
came he came back to me and said why
 
01:05:29.990 --> 01:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
don't we just eliminate that section
 
01:05:32.630 --> 01:05:32.640 align:start position:0%
because the administrative rules with
 
01:05:36.170 --> 01:05:36.180 align:start position:0%
fisma actually cover this so this this
 
01:05:37.910 --> 01:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
should be a fairly
 
01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:38.569 align:start position:0%
should be a fairly
um

01:05:38.569 --> 01:05:38.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:41.089 --> 01:05:41.099 align:start position:0%
simple change I believe the department
 
01:05:44.329 --> 01:05:44.339 align:start position:0%
is in agreement on that so
 
01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
I hope you will consider the amendment
 
01:05:49.190 --> 01:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Ankerberg
 
01:05:50.870 --> 01:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
anybody have questions for
 
01:05:54.349 --> 01:05:54.359 align:start position:0%
representative Ankerberg on this
 
01:05:57.530 --> 01:05:57.540 align:start position:0%
I have a question and I'd like to know
 
01:05:58.849 --> 01:05:58.859 align:start position:0%
um how
 
01:06:03.230 --> 01:06:03.240 align:start position:0%
how did this this issue come up I mean
 
01:06:05.329 --> 01:06:05.339 align:start position:0%
you said you had a constituent who yes
 
01:06:07.250 --> 01:06:07.260 align:start position:0%
who got in touch with you yeah just give
 
01:06:09.410 --> 01:06:09.420 align:start position:0%
us a little background about why all of
 
01:06:12.650 --> 01:06:12.660 align:start position:0%
a sudden this was to be well I I the uh
 
01:06:16.370 --> 01:06:16.380 align:start position:0%
my constituent who's here in the room he
 
01:06:18.410 --> 01:06:18.420 align:start position:0%
had brought this to my attention about
 
01:06:21.349 --> 01:06:21.359 align:start position:0%
you know this section in here relating
 
01:06:23.930 --> 01:06:23.940 align:start position:0%
to reasonable hours of inspection and
 
01:06:26.510 --> 01:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
again what's reasonable to you may not
 
01:06:28.609 --> 01:06:28.619 align:start position:0%
be reasonable to me
 
01:06:30.829 --> 01:06:30.839 align:start position:0%
um you know so wherever possible I think
 
01:06:34.370 --> 01:06:34.380 align:start position:0%
it's it's incumbent on us to clarify the
 
01:06:38.589 --> 01:06:38.599 align:start position:0%
scope of what producers can expect
 
01:06:40.789 --> 01:06:40.799 align:start position:0%
whether they're transporting storing
 
01:06:43.190 --> 01:06:43.200 align:start position:0%
selling any product right and so they
 
01:06:45.349 --> 01:06:45.359 align:start position:0%
they should have clear guidelines as to
 
01:06:49.970 --> 01:06:49.980 align:start position:0%
know what their what the hours and scope
 
01:06:52.309 --> 01:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
of any investigation would be thank you
 
01:06:55.069 --> 01:06:55.079 align:start position:0%
and are you you mentioned the hours were
 
01:06:57.950 --> 01:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
already specified in rules somewhere
 
01:06:59.930 --> 01:06:59.940 align:start position:0%
else uh that that's what the
 
01:07:02.270 --> 01:07:02.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner has told me yes so it's
 
01:07:04.490 --> 01:07:04.500 align:start position:0%
already in statute
 
01:07:08.329 --> 01:07:08.339 align:start position:0%
um so and as he has related to me this
 
01:07:10.970 --> 01:07:10.980 align:start position:0%
is a his enforcement arm is a five day a
 
01:07:14.870 --> 01:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
week operation uh I I we don't see a
 
01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
we don't see any history of abuse of
 
01:07:19.970 --> 01:07:19.980 align:start position:0%
this uh we don't
 
01:07:22.309 --> 01:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
um we don't anticipate that there there
 
01:07:24.529 --> 01:07:24.539 align:start position:0%
would be it's just a simple matter of
 
01:07:26.150 --> 01:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
trying to clarify what reasonable hours
 
01:07:29.450 --> 01:07:29.460 align:start position:0%
were so thank you deference to that we
 
01:07:31.250 --> 01:07:31.260 align:start position:0%
have agreed to just strip out this
 
01:07:34.190 --> 01:07:34.200 align:start position:0%
section and just
 
01:07:36.109 --> 01:07:36.119 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative Crichton
 
01:07:38.930 --> 01:07:38.940 align:start position:0%
has a question for you representative
 
01:07:40.970 --> 01:07:40.980 align:start position:0%
thank you so much uh thank you madam
 
01:07:46.390 --> 01:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
chair uh but as I look at the amendment
 
01:07:49.190 --> 01:07:49.200 align:start position:0%
there's a sentence in the bill that says
 
01:07:52.309 --> 01:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
he or she shall have power in person
 
01:07:55.370 --> 01:07:55.380 align:start position:0%
or by his Deputy agent to open any box
 
01:07:58.549 --> 01:07:58.559 align:start position:0%
Barrel or any other container now that
 
01:08:01.430 --> 01:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
comes out that sentence also comes out
 
01:08:04.910 --> 01:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
in the amendment yes be thank you for
 
01:08:06.470 --> 01:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
the question yes that is already
 
01:08:08.750 --> 01:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
referred to in the the rules that the
 
01:08:10.609 --> 01:08:10.619 align:start position:0%
commissioner operates under so that's
 
01:08:13.430 --> 01:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
already in there as well yes so this is
 
01:08:15.109 --> 01:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
just taking out of out of this statute
 
01:08:15.119 --> 01:08:16.090 align:start position:0%
just taking out of out of this statute
and

01:08:16.090 --> 01:08:16.100 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:08:18.289 --> 01:08:18.299 align:start position:0%
leaving that out and it because it
 
01:08:20.329 --> 01:08:20.339 align:start position:0%
already appears in another place
 
01:08:22.910 --> 01:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
under the fisma rules thank you the
 
01:08:25.189 --> 01:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
commissioner could probably testify to
 
01:08:25.199 --> 01:08:26.990 align:start position:0%
commissioner could probably testify to
that

01:08:26.990 --> 01:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:08:30.169 --> 01:08:30.179 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative NAB
 
01:08:31.970 --> 01:08:31.980 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um I just wonder
 
01:08:33.110 --> 01:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
maybe this is a question for the
 
01:08:35.510 --> 01:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner if this if similar language
 
01:08:37.249 --> 01:08:37.259 align:start position:0%
is in place under all of these
 
01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
regulations and where you draw the line
 
01:08:41.329 --> 01:08:41.339 align:start position:0%
at not needing any of this guideline
 
01:08:44.510 --> 01:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
information as to access and ability to
 
01:08:47.090 --> 01:08:47.100 align:start position:0%
to yeah thank you for the question uh we
 
01:08:48.650 --> 01:08:48.660 align:start position:0%
had just gone over that
 
01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
um and the commissioner had mentioned to
 
01:08:52.430 --> 01:08:52.440 align:start position:0%
me that there may be some need to go
 
01:08:54.829 --> 01:08:54.839 align:start position:0%
through all of these uh just to make
 
01:08:56.209 --> 01:08:56.219 align:start position:0%
sure that they're
 
01:08:59.749 --> 01:08:59.759 align:start position:0%
um you know the same scope
 
01:09:02.749 --> 01:09:02.759 align:start position:0%
so I I can't speak to the fisma uh
 
01:09:04.910 --> 01:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
regulations that that he operates under
 
01:09:06.289 --> 01:09:06.299 align:start position:0%
I was just dealing with this particular
 
01:09:08.630 --> 01:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
section the the commissioner has
 
01:09:10.130 --> 01:09:10.140 align:start position:0%
mentioned to me that he's in agreement
 
01:09:12.470 --> 01:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
and my constituent's in agreement so I
 
01:09:14.809 --> 01:09:14.819 align:start position:0%
think we found a reasonable compromise
 
01:09:16.610 --> 01:09:16.620 align:start position:0%
here thank you
 
01:09:19.070 --> 01:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
representative Howard
 
01:09:21.110 --> 01:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman
 
01:09:22.490 --> 01:09:22.500 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:09:24.470 --> 01:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
uh and this sort of a follow-up to the
 
01:09:25.610 --> 01:09:25.620 align:start position:0%
question before
 
01:09:25.620 --> 01:09:26.470 align:start position:0%
question before
um

01:09:26.470 --> 01:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:29.329 --> 01:09:29.339 align:start position:0%
of Representative Creighton
 
01:09:31.490 --> 01:09:31.500 align:start position:0%
um it seems like you're stripping all of
 
01:09:33.229 --> 01:09:33.239 align:start position:0%
these things away and it would be I
 
01:09:35.090 --> 01:09:35.100 align:start position:0%
think it would be if you could give us
 
01:09:38.410 --> 01:09:38.420 align:start position:0%
the the place that we can find the the
 
01:09:38.420 --> 01:09:40.090 align:start position:0%
the the place that we can find the the
the

01:09:40.090 --> 01:09:40.100 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:09:42.829 --> 01:09:42.839 align:start position:0%
Department's empowerment to open the box
 
01:09:45.829 --> 01:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
to you know to take the evidence to you
 
01:09:47.689 --> 01:09:47.699 align:start position:0%
know all the provisions inside that are
 
01:09:49.729 --> 01:09:49.739 align:start position:0%
being crossed out here but because it
 
01:09:51.530 --> 01:09:51.540 align:start position:0%
seems to me that
 
01:09:51.540 --> 01:09:52.490 align:start position:0%
seems to me that
um

01:09:52.490 --> 01:09:52.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:55.669 --> 01:09:55.679 align:start position:0%
the the hours what seem to be the main
 
01:09:57.950 --> 01:09:57.960 align:start position:0%
complaint and why did why strip away all
 
01:10:00.310 --> 01:10:00.320 align:start position:0%
the other powers
 
01:10:03.010 --> 01:10:03.020 align:start position:0%
again my understanding is that these are
 
01:10:07.130 --> 01:10:07.140 align:start position:0%
redundant this is a redundant section
 
01:10:08.570 --> 01:10:08.580 align:start position:0%
uh to the authority the commissioner
 
01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
already has
 
01:10:12.229 --> 01:10:12.239 align:start position:0%
follow-up yeah
 
01:10:14.750 --> 01:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman so um could we
 
01:10:17.870 --> 01:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
could we get a reference to where
 
01:10:19.550 --> 01:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
um I I don't have that I don't have
 
01:10:21.110 --> 01:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
copies of that now but I've certainly be
 
01:10:22.970 --> 01:10:22.980 align:start position:0%
willing to provide that to the committee
 
01:10:27.470 --> 01:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:30.709 --> 01:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no other questions for
 
01:10:32.390 --> 01:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
representative Ankerberg
 
01:10:35.750 --> 01:10:35.760 align:start position:0%

01:11:14.390 --> 01:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
looking for deregulation and a little
 
01:11:16.130 --> 01:11:16.140 align:start position:0%
more freedom
 
01:11:19.250 --> 01:11:19.260 align:start position:0%
um I did put this uh Bill forward with
 
01:11:22.550 --> 01:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
uh Aiden's help here uh I'm looking for
 
01:11:26.510 --> 01:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
ways in which we can scale back uh some
 
01:11:28.490 --> 01:11:28.500 align:start position:0%
of the uh
 
01:11:32.630 --> 01:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
uh regulation a good opportunity here
 
01:11:34.729 --> 01:11:34.739 align:start position:0%
um and I just wanted to yeah clarify
 
01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:36.719 align:start position:0%
that I am in uh support of this
 
01:11:39.890 --> 01:11:39.900 align:start position:0%
compromise with him and uh
 
01:11:43.550 --> 01:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
yeah I think it'd be a good one for uh
 
01:11:46.790 --> 01:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
us to put forward that's about it
 
01:11:50.630 --> 01:11:50.640 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions for Mr Nass
 
01:11:52.490 --> 01:11:52.500 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
01:11:54.530 --> 01:11:54.540 align:start position:0%
and thank you for coming in today
 
01:11:56.390 --> 01:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
and I would like now to invite
 
01:11:59.530 --> 01:11:59.540 align:start position:0%
commissioner Jasper up Jasper pardon me
 
01:12:02.990 --> 01:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
Jasper to come and speak on behalf of
 
01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:07.970 align:start position:0%
Jasper to come and speak on behalf of
hb79

01:12:07.970 --> 01:12:07.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:09.950 --> 01:12:09.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam
 
01:12:11.870 --> 01:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I'm still Sean
 
01:12:15.709 --> 01:12:15.719 align:start position:0%
Jasper and I'm still the commissioner
 
01:12:15.719 --> 01:12:16.490 align:start position:0%
Jasper and I'm still the commissioner
um

01:12:16.490 --> 01:12:16.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:18.890 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:12:18.890 --> 01:12:18.900 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
apparently we had a little
 
01:12:23.149 --> 01:12:23.159 align:start position:0%
it's just slight breakdown in
 
01:12:23.159 --> 01:12:24.649 align:start position:0%
it's just slight breakdown in
Communications

01:12:24.649 --> 01:12:24.659 align:start position:0%
Communications
 
01:12:27.229 --> 01:12:27.239 align:start position:0%
products safety and I would call your
 
01:12:28.930 --> 01:12:28.940 align:start position:0%
attention it's chapter
 
01:12:33.169 --> 01:12:33.179 align:start position:0%
426 a and the rules are
 
01:12:36.530 --> 01:12:36.540 align:start position:0%
I don't want to if you go to the
 
01:12:38.330 --> 01:12:38.340 align:start position:0%
department website and you go to rules
 
01:12:40.370 --> 01:12:40.380 align:start position:0%
under the commissioner you can find find
 
01:12:44.810 --> 01:12:44.820 align:start position:0%
the rules adopted but the law is um
 
01:12:49.189 --> 01:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
specific again two reasonable hours
 
01:12:53.030 --> 01:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
we're in uh you know an eight to four
 
01:12:55.729 --> 01:12:55.739 align:start position:0%
four operation actually and so those
 
01:12:58.490 --> 01:12:58.500 align:start position:0%
would be the reasonable times however
 
01:13:00.470 --> 01:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
I do have the authority under this
 
01:13:03.590 --> 01:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
statute if there is an eminent threat to
 
01:13:05.149 --> 01:13:05.159 align:start position:0%
Public Safety
 
01:13:08.570 --> 01:13:08.580 align:start position:0%
to go in at other other times
 
01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
um and that's under the the fisma rule I
 
01:13:15.290 --> 01:13:15.300 align:start position:0%
frankly I I don't have a problem I don't
 
01:13:18.290 --> 01:13:18.300 align:start position:0%
believe I've just got to double check
 
01:13:21.830 --> 01:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
um with our attorney from the doj but I
 
01:13:23.930 --> 01:13:23.940 align:start position:0%
think that the amendment is fine
 
01:13:26.450 --> 01:13:26.460 align:start position:0%
frankly this whole chapter
 
01:13:29.330 --> 01:13:29.340 align:start position:0%
ought to be looked at and it might be a
 
01:13:31.790 --> 01:13:31.800 align:start position:0%
better idea and more productive to
 
01:13:34.910 --> 01:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
actually look at how
 
01:13:38.810 --> 01:13:38.820 align:start position:0%
um 34 and 26a fit together because there
 
01:13:41.030 --> 01:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
is an awful lot of overlap there we
 
01:13:44.030 --> 01:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
really when we adopted fisma that really
 
01:13:46.550 --> 01:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
wasn't looked at and there's potentially
 
01:13:49.669 --> 01:13:49.679 align:start position:0%
some confusion some redundancy and
 
01:13:51.530 --> 01:13:51.540 align:start position:0%
pretend potentially some conflicts in
 
01:13:52.970 --> 01:13:52.980 align:start position:0%
there I haven't had time to look at it
 
01:13:56.870 --> 01:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
either because what we used really is in
 
01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:58.130 align:start position:0%
either because what we used really is in
uh

01:13:58.130 --> 01:13:58.140 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:14:03.110 --> 01:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
in 426 the I think it's 426. um just had
 
01:14:04.370 --> 01:14:04.380 align:start position:0%
that there
 
01:14:07.189 --> 01:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
fisma is where we uh yeah my phone's
 
01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:11.149 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:14:11.149 --> 01:14:11.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:14.209 --> 01:14:14.219 align:start position:0%
so you know we really need need to look
 
01:14:15.950 --> 01:14:15.960 align:start position:0%
at this and see what it is but you know
 
01:14:18.229 --> 01:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
believe me I don't I'm not going to pay
 
01:14:21.709 --> 01:14:21.719 align:start position:0%
anybody never have paid anybody overtime
 
01:14:23.450 --> 01:14:23.460 align:start position:0%
just to go out and look at Apple
 
01:14:23.460 --> 01:14:25.490 align:start position:0%
just to go out and look at Apple
someplace

01:14:25.490 --> 01:14:25.500 align:start position:0%
someplace
 
01:14:27.770 --> 01:14:27.780 align:start position:0%
um so that hasn't been a problem you
 
01:14:29.149 --> 01:14:29.159 align:start position:0%
know again I think there's perception
 
01:14:30.709 --> 01:14:30.719 align:start position:0%
because I can do it at reasonable times
 
01:14:33.590 --> 01:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
but those are the only times that are
 
01:14:36.229 --> 01:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
reasonable to us is during normal
 
01:14:39.669 --> 01:14:39.679 align:start position:0%
working hours for the department
 
01:14:44.149 --> 01:14:44.159 align:start position:0%
and the rest of it you know the rules
 
01:14:48.050 --> 01:14:48.060 align:start position:0%
um on the Apple specifically expired I
 
01:14:50.870 --> 01:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
have no intention to bring those back
 
01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:51.890 align:start position:0%
have no intention to bring those back
because

01:14:51.890 --> 01:14:51.900 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:14:53.570 --> 01:14:53.580 align:start position:0%
they um
 
01:14:55.729 --> 01:14:55.739 align:start position:0%
are covered under fisma so that's why I
 
01:14:58.310 --> 01:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
think we want to be productive we could
 
01:15:00.490 --> 01:15:00.500 align:start position:0%
spend some time
 
01:15:02.870 --> 01:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
comparing those two chapters and and
 
01:15:04.430 --> 01:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out how they've better
 
01:15:06.290 --> 01:15:06.300 align:start position:0%
fit together because they probably don't
 
01:15:08.950 --> 01:15:08.960 align:start position:0%
work very well for the department or for
 
01:15:12.709 --> 01:15:12.719 align:start position:0%
anybody right now the way they are
 
01:15:14.630 --> 01:15:14.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:15:16.910 --> 01:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
um representative Bixby yes thank you
 
01:15:19.189 --> 01:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so
 
01:15:19.199 --> 01:15:20.270 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so
um

01:15:20.270 --> 01:15:20.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:22.910 --> 01:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
it do you think that it might actually
 
01:15:25.550 --> 01:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
make more sense rather than striking out
 
01:15:27.110 --> 01:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
this one
 
01:15:29.689 --> 01:15:29.699 align:start position:0%
um one paragraph or part of this one
 
01:15:32.149 --> 01:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
paragraph to maybe convert this bill
 
01:15:33.950 --> 01:15:33.960 align:start position:0%
into a study committee for the entire
 
01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:34.910 align:start position:0%
into a study committee for the entire
chapter

01:15:34.910 --> 01:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
chapter
 
01:15:38.090 --> 01:15:38.100 align:start position:0%
that would be my recommendation yes
 
01:15:41.090 --> 01:15:41.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:43.669 --> 01:15:43.679 align:start position:0%
representative Murray uh thank you madam
 
01:15:45.169 --> 01:15:45.179 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my questions
 
01:15:47.570 --> 01:15:47.580 align:start position:0%
so I guess that was sort of the the
 
01:15:47.580 --> 01:15:48.410 align:start position:0%
so I guess that was sort of the the
question

01:15:48.410 --> 01:15:48.420 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:15:51.169 --> 01:15:51.179 align:start position:0%
the question I had but also it sounded
 
01:15:53.510 --> 01:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
like this specific bill was still
 
01:15:55.729 --> 01:15:55.739 align:start position:0%
leaving in and I'm referring to both the
 
01:15:57.169 --> 01:15:57.179 align:start position:0%
underlying bill and the amendment I
 
01:15:57.179 --> 01:15:58.310 align:start position:0%
underlying bill and the amendment I
suppose

01:15:58.310 --> 01:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
suppose
 
01:15:59.870 --> 01:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
um that it was allowing rule making
 
01:16:02.510 --> 01:16:02.520 align:start position:0%
authority to still stay in there and so
 
01:16:04.970 --> 01:16:04.980 align:start position:0%
I guess my question was at what point
 
01:16:07.130 --> 01:16:07.140 align:start position:0%
does fisma take over versus the
 
01:16:08.750 --> 01:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
rulemaking and so I that was the
 
01:16:11.209 --> 01:16:11.219 align:start position:0%
question I had well we do have rules
 
01:16:15.470 --> 01:16:15.480 align:start position:0%
under fisma but they're specific to 420
 
01:16:18.410 --> 01:16:18.420 align:start position:0%
six I didn't have a chance to really
 
01:16:20.750 --> 01:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
look at this I mean because we have
 
01:16:23.750 --> 01:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
really just been operating under under
 
01:16:25.550 --> 01:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
fisma for most of these things there may
 
01:16:27.169 --> 01:16:27.179 align:start position:0%
be sections in here
 
01:16:31.729 --> 01:16:31.739 align:start position:0%
uh dealing with honey and maple that may
 
01:16:33.649 --> 01:16:33.659 align:start position:0%
need to be left in but I but I think we
 
01:16:35.149 --> 01:16:35.159 align:start position:0%
need to separate the wheat from the
 
01:16:37.850 --> 01:16:37.860 align:start position:0%
chaff here and figure out you know what
 
01:16:41.390 --> 01:16:41.400 align:start position:0%
belongs here what belongs in in 426 and
 
01:16:44.510 --> 01:16:44.520 align:start position:0%
I just simply you know we move from one
 
01:16:46.669 --> 01:16:46.679 align:start position:0%
thing to another record pace and as I
 
01:16:48.890 --> 01:16:48.900 align:start position:0%
started to look at at things after my
 
01:16:48.900 --> 01:16:51.229 align:start position:0%
started to look at at things after my
conversations

01:16:51.229 --> 01:16:51.239 align:start position:0%
conversations
 
01:16:53.870 --> 01:16:53.880 align:start position:0%
representative Ankerberg uh it occurred
 
01:16:55.669 --> 01:16:55.679 align:start position:0%
to me that probably
 
01:16:55.679 --> 01:16:56.390 align:start position:0%
to me that probably
um

01:16:56.390 --> 01:16:56.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:58.430 --> 01:16:58.440 align:start position:0%
should look at this a little in a little
 
01:17:01.850 --> 01:17:01.860 align:start position:0%
bit more more in depth certainly nothing
 
01:17:04.550 --> 01:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
that is being proposed to being stricken
 
01:17:07.070 --> 01:17:07.080 align:start position:0%
out if we don't do that right now
 
01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:08.209 align:start position:0%
out if we don't do that right now
um

01:17:08.209 --> 01:17:08.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:11.450 --> 01:17:11.460 align:start position:0%
it's not something we're doing anyhow we
 
01:17:16.010 --> 01:17:16.020 align:start position:0%
did go in in conjunction with HHS they
 
01:17:19.250 --> 01:17:19.260 align:start position:0%
identified listeria into packing
 
01:17:22.610 --> 01:17:22.620 align:start position:0%
facilities last year of apples and we
 
01:17:24.050 --> 01:17:24.060 align:start position:0%
went in
 
01:17:27.649 --> 01:17:27.659 align:start position:0%
um and did inspections and did do stop
 
01:17:30.770 --> 01:17:30.780 align:start position:0%
it sale orders on
 
01:17:33.410 --> 01:17:33.420 align:start position:0%
um on apples but that was strictly a
 
01:17:33.420 --> 01:17:36.430 align:start position:0%
um on apples but that was strictly a
defismal

01:17:36.430 --> 01:17:36.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:38.630 --> 01:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
representative knabb
 
01:17:40.010 --> 01:17:40.020 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you
 
01:17:40.020 --> 01:17:40.970 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you
commissioner

01:17:40.970 --> 01:17:40.980 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
01:17:42.890 --> 01:17:42.900 align:start position:0%
um I just wonder if you view this as
 
01:17:45.229 --> 01:17:45.239 align:start position:0%
getting rid of a redundancy or as
 
01:17:47.209 --> 01:17:47.219 align:start position:0%
deregulation because we've sort of been
 
01:17:49.189 --> 01:17:49.199 align:start position:0%
given two different narratives here I I
 
01:17:51.709 --> 01:17:51.719 align:start position:0%
think this the sponsor and certainly the
 
01:17:54.050 --> 01:17:54.060 align:start position:0%
gentleman who requested this are looking
 
01:17:56.689 --> 01:17:56.699 align:start position:0%
at it as deregulation
 
01:18:00.470 --> 01:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
as I explained to the representative
 
01:18:05.030 --> 01:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
that is not possible because if in fact
 
01:18:06.649 --> 01:18:06.659 align:start position:0%
you said okay we don't want to do any of
 
01:18:08.450 --> 01:18:08.460 align:start position:0%
this and we're going to repeal chapter
 
01:18:13.010 --> 01:18:13.020 align:start position:0%
426 in and give fisma back to the
 
01:18:13.020 --> 01:18:14.990 align:start position:0%
426 in and give fisma back to the
government

01:18:14.990 --> 01:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:18:18.050 --> 01:18:18.060 align:start position:0%
um all everything there would still take
 
01:18:21.649 --> 01:18:21.659 align:start position:0%
place strictly under Federal enforcement
 
01:18:24.530 --> 01:18:24.540 align:start position:0%
and I would challenge you to find me one
 
01:18:26.870 --> 01:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
single Farm in the state of New
 
01:18:30.290 --> 01:18:30.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that wants the USDA in versus
 
01:18:33.050 --> 01:18:33.060 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of AG markets
 
01:18:34.189 --> 01:18:34.199 align:start position:0%
and food
 
01:18:35.810 --> 01:18:35.820 align:start position:0%
because if you can I'd like to have that
 
01:18:35.820 --> 01:18:37.490 align:start position:0%
because if you can I'd like to have that
conversation

01:18:37.490 --> 01:18:37.500 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
01:18:39.770 --> 01:18:39.780 align:start position:0%
um because I think we have two totally
 
01:18:41.330 --> 01:18:41.340 align:start position:0%
different approaches
 
01:18:44.270 --> 01:18:44.280 align:start position:0%
our approach in the department is to
 
01:18:46.790 --> 01:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
work with the farmers to make things
 
01:18:50.270 --> 01:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
safe for everyone and I think the USDA
 
01:18:51.649 --> 01:18:51.659 align:start position:0%
tends to come down with a little bit
 
01:18:54.410 --> 01:18:54.420 align:start position:0%
more of an Iron Fist and
 
01:18:57.169 --> 01:18:57.179 align:start position:0%
um we're we're working and we work with
 
01:18:59.090 --> 01:18:59.100 align:start position:0%
of course Cooperative Extension to do
 
01:19:02.270 --> 01:19:02.280 align:start position:0%
the education that's necessary to make
 
01:19:05.270 --> 01:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
sure that things are going right so you
 
01:19:07.550 --> 01:19:07.560 align:start position:0%
can't do away with what people are are
 
01:19:09.649 --> 01:19:09.659 align:start position:0%
suggesting they will exist it's just
 
01:19:09.659 --> 01:19:10.490 align:start position:0%
suggesting they will exist it's just
under

01:19:10.490 --> 01:19:10.500 align:start position:0%
under
 
01:19:12.649 --> 01:19:12.659 align:start position:0%
federal or state Authority and I'll go
 
01:19:15.530 --> 01:19:15.540 align:start position:0%
with State any day of the week
 
01:19:17.030 --> 01:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
and I would have said that before I was
 
01:19:18.890 --> 01:19:18.900 align:start position:0%
commissioner too
 
01:19:20.630 --> 01:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
representative Murray you have a
 
01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:21.830 align:start position:0%
representative Murray you have a
question

01:19:21.830 --> 01:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:19:26.270 --> 01:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:28.370 --> 01:19:28.380 align:start position:0%
commissioner the response by HHS was
 
01:19:29.330 --> 01:19:29.340 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
01:19:31.669 --> 01:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
um maybe some testing of the apples that
 
01:19:33.890 --> 01:19:33.900 align:start position:0%
revealed this certain listeria and in
 
01:19:36.229 --> 01:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
which case it sounds like fisma kicked
 
01:19:38.330 --> 01:19:38.340 align:start position:0%
in and was an emergency sort of
 
01:19:40.550 --> 01:19:40.560 align:start position:0%
situation yeah well and we
 
01:19:43.010 --> 01:19:43.020 align:start position:0%
still did everything within normal
 
01:19:45.830 --> 01:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
working hours so
 
01:19:48.050 --> 01:19:48.060 align:start position:0%
and this is this is the you know we're
 
01:19:49.669 --> 01:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
the Department of Agriculture markets
 
01:19:51.950 --> 01:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
and Foods except for Foods in certain
 
01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:52.970 align:start position:0%
and Foods except for Foods in certain
place

01:19:52.970 --> 01:19:52.980 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:19:52.980 --> 01:19:54.530 align:start position:0%
place
ultimately

01:19:54.530 --> 01:19:54.540 align:start position:0%
ultimately
 
01:19:56.750 --> 01:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
I believe that we should all be under
 
01:19:58.669 --> 01:19:58.679 align:start position:0%
one Authority and I think that should be
 
01:20:01.790 --> 01:20:01.800 align:start position:0%
the Department of Agriculture
 
01:20:04.490 --> 01:20:04.500 align:start position:0%
um HHS is already 50 of the government
 
01:20:07.250 --> 01:20:07.260 align:start position:0%
and I think that they probably view the
 
01:20:09.590 --> 01:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
food part of it as somewhat of a
 
01:20:12.470 --> 01:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
stepchild and there are inherent
 
01:20:14.030 --> 01:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
conflicts by having two different
 
01:20:16.070 --> 01:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
authorities sort of
 
01:20:17.990 --> 01:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
well we're doing this when it's in the
 
01:20:19.490 --> 01:20:19.500 align:start position:0%
field and in the packing house and
 
01:20:21.110 --> 01:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
you're doing this once it gets to the
 
01:20:23.510 --> 01:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
the grocery stores or to the restaurants
 
01:20:25.370 --> 01:20:25.380 align:start position:0%
and that doesn't make a lot of sense to
 
01:20:27.830 --> 01:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
me that there ought to be a process that
 
01:20:32.570 --> 01:20:32.580 align:start position:0%
is uh smooth smooth um flowing but we
 
01:20:34.610 --> 01:20:34.620 align:start position:0%
did work well together they tested the
 
01:20:37.490 --> 01:20:37.500 align:start position:0%
apples on the store shelves found
 
01:20:40.610 --> 01:20:40.620 align:start position:0%
contamination in the packaged apples in
 
01:20:42.830 --> 01:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
the stores we went back to the source
 
01:20:46.250 --> 01:20:46.260 align:start position:0%
found the contamination
 
01:20:46.260 --> 01:20:47.149 align:start position:0%
found the contamination
um

01:20:47.149 --> 01:20:47.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:49.910 --> 01:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
in the packing facilities and worked
 
01:20:52.910 --> 01:20:52.920 align:start position:0%
with the the Packers to uh to change
 
01:20:55.910 --> 01:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
that in one case it resulted in a whole
 
01:20:58.790 --> 01:20:58.800 align:start position:0%
new packing line because they were
 
01:21:02.330 --> 01:21:02.340 align:start position:0%
operating a
 
01:21:02.340 --> 01:21:03.050 align:start position:0%
operating a
um

01:21:03.050 --> 01:21:03.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:06.169 --> 01:21:06.179 align:start position:0%
packing line that was probably new in
 
01:21:10.130 --> 01:21:10.140 align:start position:0%
the 1950s maybe in the 1940s and there
 
01:21:13.970 --> 01:21:13.980 align:start position:0%
was absolutely no way to bring it up to
 
01:21:17.390 --> 01:21:17.400 align:start position:0%
uh modern standards although I let them
 
01:21:20.149 --> 01:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
make that determination on their own I
 
01:21:22.790 --> 01:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
had some in my department that that said
 
01:21:24.470 --> 01:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
you're going to replace that line and
 
01:21:26.209 --> 01:21:26.219 align:start position:0%
you're never going to use it again and I
 
01:21:27.590 --> 01:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
said no I'm going to give them the
 
01:21:31.250 --> 01:21:31.260 align:start position:0%
opportunity to show us whether or not
 
01:21:33.229 --> 01:21:33.239 align:start position:0%
that can be brought up to current
 
01:21:35.330 --> 01:21:35.340 align:start position:0%
standards they came to their own
 
01:21:37.130 --> 01:21:37.140 align:start position:0%
conclusion that it could not and replace
 
01:21:41.149 --> 01:21:41.159 align:start position:0%
the line which I think makes them feel a
 
01:21:43.729 --> 01:21:43.739 align:start position:0%
lot better than me just saying Thou
 
01:21:45.530 --> 01:21:45.540 align:start position:0%
shalt do this
 
01:21:50.870 --> 01:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:52.729 --> 01:21:52.739 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:21:55.610 --> 01:21:55.620 align:start position:0%
representative Crichton
 
01:21:57.290 --> 01:21:57.300 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you
 
01:21:57.300 --> 01:21:58.669 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you
commissioner

01:21:58.669 --> 01:21:58.679 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
01:22:00.530 --> 01:22:00.540 align:start position:0%
um so just to make sure I understand
 
01:22:03.530 --> 01:22:03.540 align:start position:0%
what you're saying you support this bill
 
01:22:06.649 --> 01:22:06.659 align:start position:0%
as is as a first step or a bite at the
 
01:22:09.590 --> 01:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
Apple if you will I am not sure because
 
01:22:12.709 --> 01:22:12.719 align:start position:0%
I don't know what I don't know my intent
 
01:22:16.430 --> 01:22:16.440 align:start position:0%
last week was to send it over to uh the
 
01:22:19.130 --> 01:22:19.140 align:start position:0%
attorney our attorney at the doj to make
 
01:22:21.290 --> 01:22:21.300 align:start position:0%
sure I wasn't missing something
 
01:22:25.130 --> 01:22:25.140 align:start position:0%
I think I'm okay with it okay but
 
01:22:27.229 --> 01:22:27.239 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm not sure because I don't want
 
01:22:29.570 --> 01:22:29.580 align:start position:0%
to get myself in trouble by having
 
01:22:32.270 --> 01:22:32.280 align:start position:0%
missed some legal
 
01:22:34.189 --> 01:22:34.199 align:start position:0%
piece of it but I think
 
01:22:36.709 --> 01:22:36.719 align:start position:0%
the more effective thing to do is to
 
01:22:38.110 --> 01:22:38.120 align:start position:0%
look at how
 
01:22:41.510 --> 01:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
426 and 434
 
01:22:44.209 --> 01:22:44.219 align:start position:0%
can work together and be
 
01:22:48.530 --> 01:22:48.540 align:start position:0%
come a very clear set of of laws and
 
01:22:50.990 --> 01:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
rules rather than just what we overlaid
 
01:22:53.330 --> 01:22:53.340 align:start position:0%
fisma and you know
 
01:22:54.709 --> 01:22:54.719 align:start position:0%
because some of the language is
 
01:22:57.290 --> 01:22:57.300 align:start position:0%
identical on this you know stop sale I
 
01:22:59.570 --> 01:22:59.580 align:start position:0%
have authority under both I don't need
 
01:23:01.970 --> 01:23:01.980 align:start position:0%
Authority in two places and you know
 
01:23:04.490 --> 01:23:04.500 align:start position:0%
things like that
 
01:23:08.390 --> 01:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
and for a follow-up man yes the uh and
 
01:23:11.330 --> 01:23:11.340 align:start position:0%
so given that comparison between 434 and
 
01:23:11.340 --> 01:23:12.709 align:start position:0%
so given that comparison between 434 and
426

01:23:12.709 --> 01:23:12.719 align:start position:0%
426
 
01:23:14.810 --> 01:23:14.820 align:start position:0%
do you need a study committee to do that
 
01:23:17.930 --> 01:23:17.940 align:start position:0%
or do you just do that as a matter of
 
01:23:19.970 --> 01:23:19.980 align:start position:0%
course because
 
01:23:22.550 --> 01:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
well in your job jar
 
01:23:25.430 --> 01:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
think that
 
01:23:27.590 --> 01:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
you know we could do that on our own I'm
 
01:23:29.990 --> 01:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
not sure we'll get to that sometimes it
 
01:23:32.830 --> 01:23:32.840 align:start position:0%
takes a little legislative initiative a
 
01:23:36.350 --> 01:23:36.360 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to do a study to look at it
 
01:23:38.570 --> 01:23:38.580 align:start position:0%
the other thing that that does is makes
 
01:23:41.270 --> 01:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
everybody comfortable with what I what
 
01:23:43.669 --> 01:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
I'm doing if I came back and had just
 
01:23:45.770 --> 01:23:45.780 align:start position:0%
done it myself
 
01:23:48.350 --> 01:23:48.360 align:start position:0%
you'd all say oh what's that bureaucrat
 
01:23:49.310 --> 01:23:49.320 align:start position:0%
up to
 
01:23:51.169 --> 01:23:51.179 align:start position:0%
you know whereas if you're part of the
 
01:23:53.990 --> 01:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
process then you can explain to the rest
 
01:23:57.050 --> 01:23:57.060 align:start position:0%
of the the committee and being sure that
 
01:23:59.750 --> 01:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
this isn't a bureaucratic maneuver to
 
01:24:01.970 --> 01:24:01.980 align:start position:0%
get more Authority
 
01:24:03.709 --> 01:24:03.719 align:start position:0%
um because let's face it
 
01:24:05.750 --> 01:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
people always feel that that's what
 
01:24:07.610 --> 01:24:07.620 align:start position:0%
departments do and
 
01:24:11.149 --> 01:24:11.159 align:start position:0%
sometimes that's correct thank you
 
01:24:14.209 --> 01:24:14.219 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby
 
01:24:17.510 --> 01:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question if
 
01:24:19.610 --> 01:24:19.620 align:start position:0%
um if we wanted to turn this into a
 
01:24:21.470 --> 01:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
study committee would you be willing to
 
01:24:22.430 --> 01:24:22.440 align:start position:0%
help us
 
01:24:25.610 --> 01:24:25.620 align:start position:0%
um sort of create list the list the
 
01:24:28.010 --> 01:24:28.020 align:start position:0%
action items that we'd need to include
 
01:24:29.149 --> 01:24:29.159 align:start position:0%
in order to make sure that we're
 
01:24:30.410 --> 01:24:30.420 align:start position:0%
studying everything that needs to be
 
01:24:30.420 --> 01:24:31.310 align:start position:0%
studying everything that needs to be
studied

01:24:31.310 --> 01:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
studied
 
01:24:32.930 --> 01:24:32.940 align:start position:0%
I think you know the answer to that
 
01:24:34.790 --> 01:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby of course I would
 
01:24:36.709 --> 01:24:36.719 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:24:40.310 --> 01:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
representative Murray I'm sorry you're
 
01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:42.229 align:start position:0%
representative Murray I'm sorry you're
next

01:24:42.229 --> 01:24:42.239 align:start position:0%
next
 
01:24:46.390 --> 01:24:46.400 align:start position:0%
oh okay representative Compton I'm sorry
 
01:24:49.550 --> 01:24:49.560 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and uh thank you
 
01:24:52.010 --> 01:24:52.020 align:start position:0%
commissioner for taking my question
 
01:24:52.020 --> 01:24:52.910 align:start position:0%
commissioner for taking my question
um

01:24:52.910 --> 01:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:56.510 --> 01:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
I am happy to hear that uh you're would
 
01:24:58.850 --> 01:24:58.860 align:start position:0%
like this as a study committee
 
01:24:58.860 --> 01:24:59.750 align:start position:0%
like this as a study committee
um

01:24:59.750 --> 01:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:03.110 --> 01:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
and just uh for reference would you say
 
01:25:06.050 --> 01:25:06.060 align:start position:0%
that study committees uh also help
 
01:25:11.149 --> 01:25:11.159 align:start position:0%
um weed out uh wording and uh
 
01:25:13.850 --> 01:25:13.860 align:start position:0%
RS in the rsas that is no longer needed
 
01:25:15.649 --> 01:25:15.659 align:start position:0%
and bring us up to date into the 21st
 
01:25:17.689 --> 01:25:17.699 align:start position:0%
century would you say that is what a
 
01:25:19.850 --> 01:25:19.860 align:start position:0%
study committee could do I would
 
01:25:22.310 --> 01:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
certainly agree with you
 
01:25:25.189 --> 01:25:25.199 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you madam
 
01:25:27.410 --> 01:25:27.420 align:start position:0%
chair for taking my question
 
01:25:29.330 --> 01:25:29.340 align:start position:0%
um and if this were to go to a study
 
01:25:31.189 --> 01:25:31.199 align:start position:0%
committee and we are still waiting a
 
01:25:33.050 --> 01:25:33.060 align:start position:0%
reply from the doj it would we be
 
01:25:34.910 --> 01:25:34.920 align:start position:0%
expecting that prior to it going to a
 
01:25:37.070 --> 01:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
study committee or could you elaborate
 
01:25:40.130 --> 01:25:40.140 align:start position:0%
somewhat on that I I frankly if that's
 
01:25:41.930 --> 01:25:41.940 align:start position:0%
where the committee is leaning to to
 
01:25:44.870 --> 01:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
study it I would rather not waste the
 
01:25:47.930 --> 01:25:47.940 align:start position:0%
doj's time on spending the time looking
 
01:25:50.510 --> 01:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
into that I think it could be better
 
01:25:53.330 --> 01:25:53.340 align:start position:0%
that time because we you know we have a
 
01:25:55.850 --> 01:25:55.860 align:start position:0%
very limited amount of uh time we get
 
01:25:58.070 --> 01:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
from the doj and it can take some time
 
01:25:58.080 --> 01:25:58.970 align:start position:0%
from the doj and it can take some time
so

01:25:58.970 --> 01:25:58.980 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:26:01.970 --> 01:26:01.980 align:start position:0%
you know as soon as as possible if the
 
01:26:03.530 --> 01:26:03.540 align:start position:0%
you know if you could get a sense of the
 
01:26:05.330 --> 01:26:05.340 align:start position:0%
committee if that's where they were
 
01:26:08.149 --> 01:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
going then we could sort of back off and
 
01:26:10.610 --> 01:26:10.620 align:start position:0%
um look at the ex use
 
01:26:14.090 --> 01:26:14.100 align:start position:0%
um the resources more wisely I think
 
01:26:19.370 --> 01:26:19.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:22.970 --> 01:26:22.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:25.669 --> 01:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
so just to clarify
 
01:26:29.450 --> 01:26:29.460 align:start position:0%
fisma's not going anywhere of course so
 
01:26:32.209 --> 01:26:32.219 align:start position:0%
ah having the state
 
01:26:34.610 --> 01:26:34.620 align:start position:0%
have whatever Authority underneath there
 
01:26:38.510 --> 01:26:38.520 align:start position:0%
that's just basically creating a love
 
01:26:38.520 --> 01:26:39.350 align:start position:0%
that's just basically creating a love
um

01:26:39.350 --> 01:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:42.530 --> 01:26:42.540 align:start position:0%
kind of a layer so then fisma's not in
 
01:26:43.790 --> 01:26:43.800 align:start position:0%
control in a sense or the federal
 
01:26:44.990 --> 01:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
government's not in control and then
 
01:26:46.550 --> 01:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
we're still in control on the state side
 
01:26:48.229 --> 01:26:48.239 align:start position:0%
we still have to do the reporting or
 
01:26:52.250 --> 01:26:52.260 align:start position:0%
whatever is necessary to fisma correct
 
01:26:52.260 --> 01:26:53.629 align:start position:0%
whatever is necessary to fisma correct
yes

01:26:53.629 --> 01:26:53.639 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:26:57.050 --> 01:26:57.060 align:start position:0%
um in fisma so everyone knows is paid
 
01:26:58.910 --> 01:26:58.920 align:start position:0%
for 100 percent
 
01:27:00.830 --> 01:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
by the federal government
 
01:27:03.050 --> 01:27:03.060 align:start position:0%
in our statutes very clear that if they
 
01:27:05.990 --> 01:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
stop paying 100 of fisma
 
01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:06.890 align:start position:0%
stop paying 100 of fisma
um

01:27:06.890 --> 01:27:06.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:09.050 --> 01:27:09.060 align:start position:0%
then we don't do that and it reverts the
 
01:27:10.310 --> 01:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
01:27:12.530 --> 01:27:12.540 align:start position:0%
that being said even if there are some
 
01:27:14.090 --> 01:27:14.100 align:start position:0%
things in
 
01:27:16.850 --> 01:27:16.860 align:start position:0%
434 that we would say Well if you know
 
01:27:19.610 --> 01:27:19.620 align:start position:0%
if we're not doing fisma we ought to be
 
01:27:22.189 --> 01:27:22.199 align:start position:0%
doing them I'd view that as redundancy
 
01:27:24.649 --> 01:27:24.659 align:start position:0%
and so I don't think they need to be in
 
01:27:26.870 --> 01:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
State Statute if fism is going to do
 
01:27:28.729 --> 01:27:28.739 align:start position:0%
them under regardless of whose authority
 
01:27:30.110 --> 01:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
they're under
 
01:27:32.390 --> 01:27:32.400 align:start position:0%
so I really I don't believe in
 
01:27:35.689 --> 01:27:35.699 align:start position:0%
redundancy and in statute
 
01:27:37.430 --> 01:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
um as long as somebody has that
 
01:27:41.209 --> 01:27:41.219 align:start position:0%
Authority and I can't imagine that the
 
01:27:42.770 --> 01:27:42.780 align:start position:0%
feds since they've started this are
 
01:27:45.410 --> 01:27:45.420 align:start position:0%
going to uh stop stop funding it on the
 
01:27:47.930 --> 01:27:47.940 align:start position:0%
state level because obviously some of
 
01:27:50.570 --> 01:27:50.580 align:start position:0%
what is is going on
 
01:27:52.970 --> 01:27:52.980 align:start position:0%
is going to go on with with State and
 
01:27:52.980 --> 01:27:54.410 align:start position:0%
is going to go on with with State and
inspectors

01:27:54.410 --> 01:27:54.420 align:start position:0%
inspectors
 
01:27:58.490 --> 01:27:58.500 align:start position:0%
just as a course of daily
 
01:28:01.790 --> 01:28:01.800 align:start position:0%
um operations but right now we have two
 
01:28:03.890 --> 01:28:03.900 align:start position:0%
part-time inspectors
 
01:28:07.370 --> 01:28:07.380 align:start position:0%
who are doing the fisma inspections we
 
01:28:08.930 --> 01:28:08.940 align:start position:0%
just started as a matter of fact last
 
01:28:08.940 --> 01:28:10.010 align:start position:0%
just started as a matter of fact last
Friday

01:28:10.010 --> 01:28:10.020 align:start position:0%
Friday
 
01:28:11.930 --> 01:28:11.940 align:start position:0%
the person who's doing the
 
01:28:13.550 --> 01:28:13.560 align:start position:0%
administrative work and we'll be doing
 
01:28:15.050 --> 01:28:15.060 align:start position:0%
we'll be learning and doing some
 
01:28:17.629 --> 01:28:17.639 align:start position:0%
inspections but that's the entire fisma
 
01:28:21.050 --> 01:28:21.060 align:start position:0%
staff 100 paid for except of course we
 
01:28:23.030 --> 01:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
Supply the office space but they supply
 
01:28:25.729 --> 01:28:25.739 align:start position:0%
all they buy the furniture they pay for
 
01:28:28.550 --> 01:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
the desks they you know everything
 
01:28:32.450 --> 01:28:32.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:35.030 --> 01:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions for the
 
01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:37.310 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions for the
commissioner

01:28:37.310 --> 01:28:37.320 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
01:28:39.470 --> 01:28:39.480 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
01:28:42.350 --> 01:28:42.360 align:start position:0%
my pleasure
 
01:28:46.729 --> 01:28:46.739 align:start position:0%
and I'd just like to remind members part
 
01:28:50.390 --> 01:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
of the Gen Court website includes a tab
 
01:28:52.910 --> 01:28:52.920 align:start position:0%
for administrative rules so if you want
 
01:28:54.470 --> 01:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
to look up any rules from any of the
 
01:29:00.110 --> 01:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:01.250 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:29:01.250 --> 01:29:01.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:03.050 --> 01:29:03.060 align:start position:0%
are there any I don't have any other
 
01:29:06.470 --> 01:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
pink cards for this particular Bill are
 
01:29:08.689 --> 01:29:08.699 align:start position:0%
there any other folks that would like to
 
01:29:12.910 --> 01:29:12.920 align:start position:0%
testify either for or against
 
01:29:16.729 --> 01:29:16.739 align:start position:0%
seeing none I would say uh we have on
 
01:29:19.129 --> 01:29:19.139 align:start position:0%
our blue sheet three people who signed
 
01:29:22.490 --> 01:29:22.500 align:start position:0%
up in favor of HB 79
 
01:29:27.410 --> 01:29:27.420 align:start position:0%
and online we had one in favor and one
 
01:29:27.420 --> 01:29:29.510 align:start position:0%
and online we had one in favor and one
against

01:29:29.510 --> 01:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
against
 
01:29:32.030 --> 01:29:32.040 align:start position:0%
so with that I will close the hearing on
 
01:29:37.310 --> 01:29:37.320 align:start position:0%
HB 79 and we have a few minutes of break
 
01:29:50.169 --> 01:29:50.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:50.179 --> 01:29:51.950 align:start position:0%
 
128.

01:29:51.950 --> 01:29:51.960 align:start position:0%
128.
 
01:29:51.960 --> 01:29:59.450 align:start position:0%
128.
people

01:29:59.450 --> 01:29:59.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:59.460 --> 01:30:05.870 align:start position:0%
 
start

01:30:05.870 --> 01:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:05.880 --> 01:30:20.229 align:start position:0%
 
Ed yeah

01:30:20.229 --> 01:30:20.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:23.750 --> 01:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
well see if we didn't know that you know
 
01:34:47.270 --> 01:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:47.280 --> 01:34:48.950 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:34:48.950 --> 01:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:34:52.010 --> 01:34:52.020 align:start position:0%
um I'm gonna call the committee back and
 
01:34:55.250 --> 01:34:55.260 align:start position:0%
we are going to open up the hearing for
 
01:35:00.129 --> 01:35:00.139 align:start position:0%
HB 128 FN
 
01:35:04.790 --> 01:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
and to introduce this Bill Let's see we
 
01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:05.810 align:start position:0%
and to introduce this Bill Let's see we
have

01:35:05.810 --> 01:35:05.820 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:35:05.820 --> 01:35:07.250 align:start position:0%
have
um

01:35:07.250 --> 01:35:07.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:09.830 --> 01:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
representative Ankerberg
 
01:35:11.390 --> 01:35:11.400 align:start position:0%
welcome back
 
01:35:13.490 --> 01:35:13.500 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair again for the
 
01:35:15.590 --> 01:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
record I am a nankerberg I represent
 
01:35:17.629 --> 01:35:17.639 align:start position:0%
Stratford 10 which is the city of
 
01:35:19.490 --> 01:35:19.500 align:start position:0%
Rochester and I'm here to introduce
 
01:35:22.729 --> 01:35:22.739 align:start position:0%
house bill 128. so as you'll see I
 
01:35:28.250 --> 01:35:28.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:31.310 --> 01:35:31.320 align:start position:0%
um and what this does is strip out the
 
01:35:33.110 --> 01:35:33.120 align:start position:0%
language of the underlying bill
 
01:35:37.850 --> 01:35:37.860 align:start position:0%
and going towards the intent of the
 
01:35:41.050 --> 01:35:41.060 align:start position:0%
original bill which was to
 
01:35:44.570 --> 01:35:44.580 align:start position:0%
have the state be in charge of the
 
01:35:48.229 --> 01:35:48.239 align:start position:0%
licensing of seed for sale after talking
 
01:35:51.550 --> 01:35:51.560 align:start position:0%
to the director director Wyman
 
01:35:54.530 --> 01:35:54.540 align:start position:0%
we came to a realization that that is a
 
01:35:57.350 --> 01:35:57.360 align:start position:0%
unworkable system in large part because
 
01:35:59.090 --> 01:35:59.100 align:start position:0%
that would lead to New Hampshire being a
 
01:36:01.390 --> 01:36:01.400 align:start position:0%
Dumping Ground of
 
01:36:05.330 --> 01:36:05.340 align:start position:0%
junk seed so obviously nobody wants to
 
01:36:06.430 --> 01:36:06.440 align:start position:0%
do that
 
01:36:09.530 --> 01:36:09.540 align:start position:0%
the the reasoning behind the bill was
 
01:36:11.930 --> 01:36:11.940 align:start position:0%
throughout the pandemic we've seen and
 
01:36:14.030 --> 01:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
we still see in you know a large part
 
01:36:15.830 --> 01:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
with eggs other products you know
 
01:36:18.890 --> 01:36:18.900 align:start position:0%
everybody's been to the grocery store so
 
01:36:20.930 --> 01:36:20.940 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about here is food
 
01:36:20.940 --> 01:36:22.090 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about here is food
resiliency

01:36:22.090 --> 01:36:22.100 align:start position:0%
resiliency
 
01:36:25.310 --> 01:36:25.320 align:start position:0%
this this is simply a way for hobby
 
01:36:27.709 --> 01:36:27.719 align:start position:0%
Farmers to
 
01:36:31.310 --> 01:36:31.320 align:start position:0%
um you know produce more seed possibly
 
01:36:32.810 --> 01:36:32.820 align:start position:0%
sell it yeah I don't know if any of you
 
01:36:34.970 --> 01:36:34.980 align:start position:0%
folks are involved with the seed trading
 
01:36:37.370 --> 01:36:37.380 align:start position:0%
groups in your community I bought a
 
01:36:39.530 --> 01:36:39.540 align:start position:0%
greenhouse a couple years ago and have
 
01:36:41.510 --> 01:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
gotten involved with that I know the I
 
01:36:44.870 --> 01:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
know the the chairwoman here um is a
 
01:36:48.050 --> 01:36:48.060 align:start position:0%
very active farmer so I try and pick her
 
01:36:49.610 --> 01:36:49.620 align:start position:0%
brain every once in a while about you
 
01:36:50.930 --> 01:36:50.940 align:start position:0%
know how to grow some of these different
 
01:36:53.870 --> 01:36:53.880 align:start position:0%
things but um with with so many other
 
01:36:56.390 --> 01:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
folks going down this path of trying to
 
01:36:59.450 --> 01:36:59.460 align:start position:0%
produce more and more
 
01:37:02.870 --> 01:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
um of their own vegetables and things I
 
01:37:05.270 --> 01:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
thought it was appropriate to sort of
 
01:37:07.910 --> 01:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
bump up what an individual might be
 
01:37:10.310 --> 01:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
expected to be able to produce
 
01:37:12.950 --> 01:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
um so you know obviously in my little
 
01:37:14.330 --> 01:37:14.340 align:start position:0%
Greenhouse I'm not going to be able to
 
01:37:17.270 --> 01:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
produce 50 pounds of seed but some of
 
01:37:18.890 --> 01:37:18.900 align:start position:0%
these smaller Farms some of these
 
01:37:20.450 --> 01:37:20.460 align:start position:0%
operations may be able to have that if
 
01:37:22.129 --> 01:37:22.139 align:start position:0%
they're trading sort of larger
 
01:37:25.070 --> 01:37:25.080 align:start position:0%
quantities you know in the pounds
 
01:37:27.350 --> 01:37:27.360 align:start position:0%
um I I thought it was appropriate
 
01:37:29.270 --> 01:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
um that the state be seen is is bumping
 
01:37:31.430 --> 01:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
up that amount from the current level of
 
01:37:34.430 --> 01:37:34.440 align:start position:0%
25 pounds uh per year per individual
 
01:37:36.890 --> 01:37:36.900 align:start position:0%
that they could sell up and just double
 
01:37:40.010 --> 01:37:40.020 align:start position:0%
that up to 50 pounds in my talks with
 
01:37:43.610 --> 01:37:43.620 align:start position:0%
the commissioner and director Wyman they
 
01:37:44.750 --> 01:37:44.760 align:start position:0%
said that this this is not something
 
01:37:46.550 --> 01:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
that they're even currently enforcing at
 
01:37:48.410 --> 01:37:48.420 align:start position:0%
all so I think this is more of just a
 
01:37:51.830 --> 01:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
message to the the citizenry that we we
 
01:37:55.330 --> 01:37:55.340 align:start position:0%
are open as a state to you you know
 
01:37:58.729 --> 01:37:58.739 align:start position:0%
providing that buffer for your family in
 
01:38:00.470 --> 01:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
order to produce these seeds and if you
 
01:38:02.030 --> 01:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
have a surplus then of course you'd be
 
01:38:04.430 --> 01:38:04.440 align:start position:0%
able to sell up to 50 pounds a year so
 
01:38:07.970 --> 01:38:07.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:10.189 --> 01:38:10.199 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Ankerberg
 
01:38:13.490 --> 01:38:13.500 align:start position:0%
question representative Murray
 
01:38:18.169 --> 01:38:18.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:20.149 --> 01:38:20.159 align:start position:0%
particular delineating between somebody
 
01:38:23.810 --> 01:38:23.820 align:start position:0%
simply trading another Farmer for things
 
01:38:26.750 --> 01:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
or physically selling for profit so can
 
01:38:28.490 --> 01:38:28.500 align:start position:0%
you elaborate on yourself thank you for
 
01:38:29.450 --> 01:38:29.460 align:start position:0%
the question
 
01:38:32.990 --> 01:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
um so yes of course like seed trading is
 
01:38:35.229 --> 01:38:35.239 align:start position:0%
um it has become something
 
01:38:39.530 --> 01:38:39.540 align:start position:0%
that is sort of evoke right now uh but
 
01:38:41.270 --> 01:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
but my thinking was that we're not we're
 
01:38:43.669 --> 01:38:43.679 align:start position:0%
not talking obviously people selling in
 
01:38:46.010 --> 01:38:46.020 align:start position:0%
stores and things but we want to keep it
 
01:38:48.530 --> 01:38:48.540 align:start position:0%
open uh what I was thinking is more of a
 
01:38:50.629 --> 01:38:50.639 align:start position:0%
farmer's market type
 
01:38:52.610 --> 01:38:52.620 align:start position:0%
type setting so if somebody had little
 
01:38:54.530 --> 01:38:54.540 align:start position:0%
packets of seeds say you know but they
 
01:38:56.570 --> 01:38:56.580 align:start position:0%
would get up to that
 
01:38:59.870 --> 01:38:59.880 align:start position:0%
um they could get up to over the 25
 
01:39:03.050 --> 01:39:03.060 align:start position:0%
pound limit now you know but again if
 
01:39:05.930 --> 01:39:05.940 align:start position:0%
you just for scale I don't know if if
 
01:39:08.629 --> 01:39:08.639 align:start position:0%
you have a yard at home right so every
 
01:39:11.149 --> 01:39:11.159 align:start position:0%
year my plow guy rips up you know all my
 
01:39:13.550 --> 01:39:13.560 align:start position:0%
grass along the driveway and you know I
 
01:39:16.370 --> 01:39:16.380 align:start position:0%
have to fill that in well I go to the
 
01:39:19.850 --> 01:39:19.860 align:start position:0%
store and I buy a bag of seed right so
 
01:39:22.610 --> 01:39:22.620 align:start position:0%
usually that's you know 40 50 pounds you
 
01:39:24.410 --> 01:39:24.420 align:start position:0%
know I have chickens again that'd be a
 
01:39:26.930 --> 01:39:26.940 align:start position:0%
50 pound bag right so we're talking you
 
01:39:29.689 --> 01:39:29.699 align:start position:0%
know 50 pounds it's not something you'd
 
01:39:32.570 --> 01:39:32.580 align:start position:0%
be able to seed you know a large
 
01:39:35.270 --> 01:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
agricultural operation with we're
 
01:39:37.490 --> 01:39:37.500 align:start position:0%
talking about home
 
01:39:40.490 --> 01:39:40.500 align:start position:0%
um you know providing that buffer for
 
01:39:43.010 --> 01:39:43.020 align:start position:0%
families to be able to produce their
 
01:39:45.050 --> 01:39:45.060 align:start position:0%
their own seeds and things and if you
 
01:39:46.910 --> 01:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
don't have experience in doing that it
 
01:39:48.649 --> 01:39:48.659 align:start position:0%
can be difficult at first to harvest the
 
01:39:50.390 --> 01:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
seeds because you'll have a very low
 
01:39:53.030 --> 01:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
success rate of them growing so if you
 
01:39:54.410 --> 01:39:54.420 align:start position:0%
could get them if I could get them from
 
01:39:57.350 --> 01:39:57.360 align:start position:0%
chairwoman Aaron who I know knows what
 
01:39:59.450 --> 01:39:59.460 align:start position:0%
she's doing and harvesting them
 
01:40:00.950 --> 01:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
um you know and she could offer me some
 
01:40:04.189 --> 01:40:04.199 align:start position:0%
you know whatever whatever the the case
 
01:40:06.410 --> 01:40:06.420 align:start position:0%
may be there that that provides me with
 
01:40:07.850 --> 01:40:07.860 align:start position:0%
a little more Comfort if I'm going to be
 
01:40:09.530 --> 01:40:09.540 align:start position:0%
planting those and expecting to to
 
01:40:11.450 --> 01:40:11.460 align:start position:0%
harvest them so
 
01:40:11.460 --> 01:40:13.729 align:start position:0%
harvest them so
representative

01:40:13.729 --> 01:40:13.739 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:40:15.169 --> 01:40:15.179 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you
 
01:40:18.290 --> 01:40:18.300 align:start position:0%
representative uh for taking my question
 
01:40:21.590 --> 01:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
um now how would we and I understand
 
01:40:24.470 --> 01:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
that 50 pounds is not a lot
 
01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:25.850 align:start position:0%
that 50 pounds is not a lot
but

01:40:25.850 --> 01:40:25.860 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:40:28.610 --> 01:40:28.620 align:start position:0%
um and they're currently nothing's being
 
01:40:31.370 --> 01:40:31.380 align:start position:0%
enforced but we are have to be conscious
 
01:40:33.590 --> 01:40:33.600 align:start position:0%
also of any noxious seeds that come into
 
01:40:35.689 --> 01:40:35.699 align:start position:0%
these packets and how that will affect
 
01:40:38.149 --> 01:40:38.159 align:start position:0%
the uh State as a whole
 
01:40:41.030 --> 01:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh what would you say to that
 
01:40:43.370 --> 01:40:43.380 align:start position:0%
oh thank you for the question I I my
 
01:40:44.689 --> 01:40:44.699 align:start position:0%
response to that would be what what are
 
01:40:46.669 --> 01:40:46.679 align:start position:0%
we doing now right
 
01:40:49.250 --> 01:40:49.260 align:start position:0%
um so if it was the the committee's wish
 
01:40:51.110 --> 01:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
I mean you could certainly amend that to
 
01:40:53.330 --> 01:40:53.340 align:start position:0%
say in in-state sales and then you're
 
01:40:56.030 --> 01:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
we're not Crossing Lines I mean what
 
01:40:57.410 --> 01:40:57.420 align:start position:0%
would we have for an invasive species
 
01:40:59.209 --> 01:40:59.219 align:start position:0%
that wasn't already being harvested and
 
01:41:01.729 --> 01:41:01.739 align:start position:0%
cultivated here right so I mean I I
 
01:41:03.410 --> 01:41:03.420 align:start position:0%
don't know that anybody is going to be
 
01:41:05.330 --> 01:41:05.340 align:start position:0%
harvesting you know Japanese not weed
 
01:41:06.950 --> 01:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
and be selling that in their Community
 
01:41:10.310 --> 01:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
to you know to take take over
 
01:41:12.290 --> 01:41:12.300 align:start position:0%
um so I mean realistically we'd be
 
01:41:14.750 --> 01:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
talking about more you know Tomatoes
 
01:41:18.890 --> 01:41:18.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:20.810 --> 01:41:20.820 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby
 
01:41:22.129 --> 01:41:22.139 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
01:41:22.139 --> 01:41:23.090 align:start position:0%
okay so
um

01:41:23.090 --> 01:41:23.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:25.729 --> 01:41:25.739 align:start position:0%
a couple of uh just just so that you're
 
01:41:25.739 --> 01:41:27.110 align:start position:0%
a couple of uh just just so that you're
aware

01:41:27.110 --> 01:41:27.120 align:start position:0%
aware
 
01:41:29.629 --> 01:41:29.639 align:start position:0%
um I was on the committee when we set
 
01:41:32.990 --> 01:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
the limit at 25 and we set that limit
 
01:41:35.689 --> 01:41:35.699 align:start position:0%
because we
 
01:41:35.699 --> 01:41:36.229 align:start position:0%
because we
um

01:41:36.229 --> 01:41:36.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:38.810 --> 01:41:38.820 align:start position:0%
thought that 25 was an awful lot of
 
01:41:40.850 --> 01:41:40.860 align:start position:0%
seeds and
 
01:41:43.010 --> 01:41:43.020 align:start position:0%
um and I just wanted to make sure that
 
01:41:45.830 --> 01:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
you're aware that so are you aware that
 
01:41:47.629 --> 01:41:47.639 align:start position:0%
this is not dealing with grass seed but
 
01:41:50.510 --> 01:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
only fruit flour and vegetable seeds yes
 
01:41:54.590 --> 01:41:54.600 align:start position:0%
okay and uh do you know about how many
 
01:41:58.430 --> 01:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
seed tomato seeds you get in a pound
 
01:42:00.350 --> 01:42:00.360 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question I I
 
01:42:02.810 --> 01:42:02.820 align:start position:0%
don't know that that's relevant uh well
 
01:42:05.149 --> 01:42:05.159 align:start position:0%
it I think if we're setting a limit for
 
01:42:07.310 --> 01:42:07.320 align:start position:0%
the number for how many how much we're
 
01:42:10.370 --> 01:42:10.380 align:start position:0%
selling I think it is relevant to be
 
01:42:11.990 --> 01:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
aware that
 
01:42:15.169 --> 01:42:15.179 align:start position:0%
um there are an awful lot of that
 
01:42:17.629 --> 01:42:17.639 align:start position:0%
for the I'm just thinking about scale
 
01:42:21.890 --> 01:42:21.900 align:start position:0%
here and I'm wondering if
 
01:42:24.830 --> 01:42:24.840 align:start position:0%
um there's really any point in
 
01:42:27.830 --> 01:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
in changing our current 25 pounds
 
01:42:32.629 --> 01:42:32.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:34.090 --> 01:42:34.100 align:start position:0%
I I'm I'm
 
01:42:38.270 --> 01:42:38.280 align:start position:0%
not entirely sure
 
01:42:40.310 --> 01:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
um well I guess maybe I should rephrase
 
01:42:42.350 --> 01:42:42.360 align:start position:0%
this question because I'm I'm getting in
 
01:42:44.750 --> 01:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
I'm running into the danger of making a
 
01:42:46.729 --> 01:42:46.739 align:start position:0%
comment as opposed to asking a question
 
01:42:46.739 --> 01:42:48.350 align:start position:0%
comment as opposed to asking a question
but

01:42:48.350 --> 01:42:48.360 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:42:51.649 --> 01:42:51.659 align:start position:0%
um have you heard of any instances where
 
01:42:55.010 --> 01:42:55.020 align:start position:0%
someone in New Hampshire was trying to
 
01:42:58.430 --> 01:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
sell seed of vegetables or fruits or
 
01:43:02.750 --> 01:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
flowers and ran up against this limit
 
01:43:05.510 --> 01:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
I I have not heard of any any case
 
01:43:08.270 --> 01:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
thereof but again having a limit in
 
01:43:10.550 --> 01:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
statute means that somebody would have
 
01:43:13.010 --> 01:43:13.020 align:start position:0%
to be cognizant of that right so that
 
01:43:15.590 --> 01:43:15.600 align:start position:0%
could actually serve as a Prohibition a
 
01:43:17.090 --> 01:43:17.100 align:start position:0%
self-imposed Prohibition on somebody
 
01:43:19.550 --> 01:43:19.560 align:start position:0%
from harvesting that amount of seed
 
01:43:22.790 --> 01:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:22.800 --> 01:43:26.470 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:43:26.470 --> 01:43:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:28.490 --> 01:43:28.500 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman thank you for
 
01:43:30.890 --> 01:43:30.900 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question uh
 
01:43:32.629 --> 01:43:32.639 align:start position:0%
somewhat similar I suppose to
 
01:43:34.370 --> 01:43:34.380 align:start position:0%
representative bixby's questioner where
 
01:43:36.709 --> 01:43:36.719 align:start position:0%
I think he was going in part uh so in
 
01:43:39.290 --> 01:43:39.300 align:start position:0%
the absence of evidence of a need to
 
01:43:41.750 --> 01:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
make this change and knowing as as you
 
01:43:43.609 --> 01:43:43.619 align:start position:0%
said that it isn't being enforced at the
 
01:43:45.950 --> 01:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
moment is this uh kind of a classic
 
01:43:48.169 --> 01:43:48.179 align:start position:0%
example of a solution in search of a
 
01:43:48.179 --> 01:43:49.609 align:start position:0%
example of a solution in search of a
problem

01:43:49.609 --> 01:43:49.619 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:43:51.890 --> 01:43:51.900 align:start position:0%
I thank you for the question I I would
 
01:43:54.550 --> 01:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
say that this is this is a compromise
 
01:43:58.250 --> 01:43:58.260 align:start position:0%
seeking to expand or move the goal post
 
01:44:02.030 --> 01:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
further out in the with the reasoning
 
01:44:04.250 --> 01:44:04.260 align:start position:0%
and the rationale that somebody may wish
 
01:44:07.669 --> 01:44:07.679 align:start position:0%
to encroach on that 25 pound number and
 
01:44:09.649 --> 01:44:09.659 align:start position:0%
if they are say one pound over we would
 
01:44:11.390 --> 01:44:11.400 align:start position:0%
say that you would be allowed to sell
 
01:44:14.209 --> 01:44:14.219 align:start position:0%
that seed I I don't know that we we have
 
01:44:15.709 --> 01:44:15.719 align:start position:0%
seen evidence either way of it being
 
01:44:17.930 --> 01:44:17.940 align:start position:0%
beneficial or a problem
 
01:44:20.149 --> 01:44:20.159 align:start position:0%
right so so I don't know that 26 pounds
 
01:44:24.649 --> 01:44:24.659 align:start position:0%
is is necessarily a negative in regards
 
01:44:27.590 --> 01:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
to a 25 pound or 50 pound limit I I
 
01:44:31.750 --> 01:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:35.030 --> 01:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
yes sir thank you uh well in that case
 
01:44:36.590 --> 01:44:36.600 align:start position:0%
we're talking about evidence right since
 
01:44:38.209 --> 01:44:38.219 align:start position:0%
we're talking about changing statutes
 
01:44:40.129 --> 01:44:40.139 align:start position:0%
shouldn't the requirement for evidence
 
01:44:42.470 --> 01:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
be on the side of the need for a change
 
01:44:43.609 --> 01:44:43.619 align:start position:0%
right I hear what you're saying in terms
 
01:44:45.830 --> 01:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
of we don't have evidence either way but
 
01:44:47.629 --> 01:44:47.639 align:start position:0%
with a piece of legislation the burden
 
01:44:49.970 --> 01:44:49.980 align:start position:0%
is on the proposer to present evidence
 
01:44:52.310 --> 01:44:52.320 align:start position:0%
that there is reason to change the
 
01:44:53.570 --> 01:44:53.580 align:start position:0%
current statute
 
01:44:56.510 --> 01:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
yes I I would thank you for that and I
 
01:44:59.270 --> 01:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
my position on on the bill and and with
 
01:45:01.910 --> 01:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
these ideas is that what what I am going
 
01:45:04.669 --> 01:45:04.679 align:start position:0%
from is is past experience recent
 
01:45:06.169 --> 01:45:06.179 align:start position:0%
experience going through the pandemic
 
01:45:08.629 --> 01:45:08.639 align:start position:0%
and going to grocery stores and things
 
01:45:09.950 --> 01:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
and not being able to find certain
 
01:45:12.709 --> 01:45:12.719 align:start position:0%
products certain vegetables and so with
 
01:45:14.750 --> 01:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
with that in mind what we want what I
 
01:45:16.729 --> 01:45:16.739 align:start position:0%
was thinking is that this this serves as
 
01:45:19.430 --> 01:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
a hedge against that against uh
 
01:45:21.290 --> 01:45:21.300 align:start position:0%
consumers not being able to have those
 
01:45:22.910 --> 01:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
products because if the local
 
01:45:24.770 --> 01:45:24.780 align:start position:0%
supermarket doesn't have those a local
 
01:45:28.010 --> 01:45:28.020 align:start position:0%
grower may be able to have like a crop
 
01:45:29.689 --> 01:45:29.699 align:start position:0%
of that available at a farmer's market
 
01:45:33.050 --> 01:45:33.060 align:start position:0%
type setting where the consumer could
 
01:45:34.970 --> 01:45:34.980 align:start position:0%
get that product whereas the the larger
 
01:45:36.950 --> 01:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
Supermarket may not be able to obtain
 
01:45:38.810 --> 01:45:38.820 align:start position:0%
those products
 
01:45:41.030 --> 01:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:45:44.570 --> 01:45:44.580 align:start position:0%
thank you and um representative Murray
 
01:45:46.970 --> 01:45:46.980 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
01:45:49.070 --> 01:45:49.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:45:51.590 --> 01:45:51.600 align:start position:0%
um I do have a I I'm curious to know
 
01:45:53.330 --> 01:45:53.340 align:start position:0%
about the intersection and do you know
 
01:45:54.950 --> 01:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
about the intersection of potential
 
01:45:56.810 --> 01:45:56.820 align:start position:0%
cross-contamination like save garlic
 
01:45:58.550 --> 01:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
mustard got into the seed packet or
 
01:46:01.010 --> 01:46:01.020 align:start position:0%
something of that nature and you had 50
 
01:46:03.470 --> 01:46:03.480 align:start position:0%
pounds of of seeds that were being
 
01:46:05.330 --> 01:46:05.340 align:start position:0%
self-sourced or
 
01:46:05.340 --> 01:46:06.709 align:start position:0%
self-sourced or
um

01:46:06.709 --> 01:46:06.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:10.430 --> 01:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
do you find any concern for the invasive
 
01:46:13.430 --> 01:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
species of plants that we are we are we
 
01:46:14.330 --> 01:46:14.340 align:start position:0%
do have
 
01:46:14.340 --> 01:46:15.530 align:start position:0%
do have
um

01:46:15.530 --> 01:46:15.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:17.930 --> 01:46:17.940 align:start position:0%
concern for certain species you
 
01:46:19.250 --> 01:46:19.260 align:start position:0%
mentioned not weeds so I'm just curious
 
01:46:22.070 --> 01:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
if you yes thank you for the question uh
 
01:46:24.890 --> 01:46:24.900 align:start position:0%
my understanding in in a larger setting
 
01:46:26.629 --> 01:46:26.639 align:start position:0%
is I know there's been
 
01:46:29.149 --> 01:46:29.159 align:start position:0%
um some complaints among genetically
 
01:46:31.490 --> 01:46:31.500 align:start position:0%
modified seeds and things like that are
 
01:46:33.590 --> 01:46:33.600 align:start position:0%
actually being produced as hybrids and
 
01:46:36.410 --> 01:46:36.420 align:start position:0%
things going into you know somebody
 
01:46:38.510 --> 01:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
else's another Farmer's property and
 
01:46:41.270 --> 01:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
then then the farmers claiming you know
 
01:46:43.970 --> 01:46:43.980 align:start position:0%
that you you've now infringed on my my
 
01:46:45.890 --> 01:46:45.900 align:start position:0%
product but again that that could be as
 
01:46:48.350 --> 01:46:48.360 align:start position:0%
simple as one seed right so that could
 
01:46:50.450 --> 01:46:50.460 align:start position:0%
be picked up by a bird dropped over on
 
01:46:52.310 --> 01:46:52.320 align:start position:0%
somebody else's property so I mean I I
 
01:46:54.229 --> 01:46:54.239 align:start position:0%
don't know the difference even between a
 
01:46:57.350 --> 01:46:57.360 align:start position:0%
pound 50 pounds or a Single Seed because
 
01:47:00.050 --> 01:47:00.060 align:start position:0%
the that possibility still exists and I
 
01:47:01.669 --> 01:47:01.679 align:start position:0%
mean that that possibility exists in
 
01:47:04.609 --> 01:47:04.619 align:start position:0%
nature as it is now so I I'm not sure
 
01:47:08.149 --> 01:47:08.159 align:start position:0%
that you know with a fear of of a
 
01:47:11.270 --> 01:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
natural cause right I mean we've all
 
01:47:14.030 --> 01:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
seen the dandelions right the the little
 
01:47:15.350 --> 01:47:15.360 align:start position:0%
uh white things like flying through the
 
01:47:18.050 --> 01:47:18.060 align:start position:0%
air here in springtime right so we know
 
01:47:20.510 --> 01:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
that that that that cross pollination
 
01:47:22.490 --> 01:47:22.500 align:start position:0%
thing that happens in in neighborhoods
 
01:47:26.570 --> 01:47:26.580 align:start position:0%
in a you know in our state already so I
 
01:47:29.570 --> 01:47:29.580 align:start position:0%
again I I think it's it's best to just
 
01:47:31.669 --> 01:47:31.679 align:start position:0%
think of the scope of this and and what
 
01:47:33.530 --> 01:47:33.540 align:start position:0%
the the intent is I mean I I'm talking
 
01:47:35.930 --> 01:47:35.940 align:start position:0%
about tomatoes not Japanese not weed
 
01:47:39.169 --> 01:47:39.179 align:start position:0%
right so or something similar
 
01:47:41.330 --> 01:47:41.340 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:47:43.010 --> 01:47:43.020 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
01:47:45.709 --> 01:47:45.719 align:start position:0%
for representative ankenberg
 
01:47:47.810 --> 01:47:47.820 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
 
01:47:50.270 --> 01:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
testimony and I call Alan Wyman from
 
01:47:57.290 --> 01:47:57.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:57.300 --> 01:48:00.229 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:48:00.229 --> 01:48:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:06.790 --> 01:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:10.430 --> 01:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
press the button there you go thank you
 
01:48:12.410 --> 01:48:12.420 align:start position:0%
um thank you for having me up here again
 
01:48:14.629 --> 01:48:14.639 align:start position:0%
my name is Al Wyman in this capacity I'm
 
01:48:16.010 --> 01:48:16.020 align:start position:0%
acting as a New Hampshire seed law
 
01:48:18.290 --> 01:48:18.300 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer I work for the
 
01:48:19.430 --> 01:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
division of regulatory Services
 
01:48:21.310 --> 01:48:21.320 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
01:48:23.750 --> 01:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
Agriculture markets and food
 
01:48:26.810 --> 01:48:26.820 align:start position:0%
as I understand the when I was first
 
01:48:29.270 --> 01:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
given a copy of the bill I think is
 
01:48:30.649 --> 01:48:30.659 align:start position:0%
significantly different than what we're
 
01:48:32.570 --> 01:48:32.580 align:start position:0%
speaking about now if I understand and
 
01:48:35.270 --> 01:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
for clarity I'm speaking to the change
 
01:48:39.890 --> 01:48:39.900 align:start position:0%
only of 25 to 50 pounds in that RSA
 
01:48:42.830 --> 01:48:42.840 align:start position:0%
um I can't speak either way uh as to
 
01:48:44.810 --> 01:48:44.820 align:start position:0%
whether I oppose it do not oppose as as
 
01:48:46.669 --> 01:48:46.679 align:start position:0%
you guys I think already know at this
 
01:48:47.930 --> 01:48:47.940 align:start position:0%
point it's it's one of the national
 
01:48:50.510 --> 01:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
programs it's put out by Ross ASCO
 
01:48:52.550 --> 01:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
through through Russell which is the
 
01:48:56.030 --> 01:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
uniform State legislation uh I it's it's
 
01:48:57.709 --> 01:48:57.719 align:start position:0%
in heart it's heartening to know there
 
01:49:00.189 --> 01:49:00.199 align:start position:0%
was an individual here who who
 
01:49:02.629 --> 01:49:02.639 align:start position:0%
understands why the 25 pounds were put
 
01:49:05.750 --> 01:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
in place to begin with I do not and
 
01:49:07.310 --> 01:49:07.320 align:start position:0%
typically what I would do in a situation
 
01:49:11.270 --> 01:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
like this is contact other state law
 
01:49:14.689 --> 01:49:14.699 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers as well as ASCO and
 
01:49:17.209 --> 01:49:17.219 align:start position:0%
the president there in in their staff to
 
01:49:19.850 --> 01:49:19.860 align:start position:0%
to see that this isn't uh gonna be
 
01:49:21.530 --> 01:49:21.540 align:start position:0%
friction with other state laws because
 
01:49:24.109 --> 01:49:24.119 align:start position:0%
what we don't want to do is is uh cost
 
01:49:27.169 --> 01:49:27.179 align:start position:0%
manufacturer to then have to a relative
 
01:49:29.870 --> 01:49:29.880 align:start position:0%
I can't speak relative to the the uh
 
01:49:29.880 --> 01:49:32.629 align:start position:0%
I can't speak relative to the the uh
well

01:49:32.629 --> 01:49:32.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:34.430 --> 01:49:34.440 align:start position:0%
this really is associated with noxious
 
01:49:36.530 --> 01:49:36.540 align:start position:0%
weeds invasive species and plant variety
 
01:49:38.629 --> 01:49:38.639 align:start position:0%
protection act right now the larger
 
01:49:39.950 --> 01:49:39.960 align:start position:0%
companies have the capability and
 
01:49:41.930 --> 01:49:41.940 align:start position:0%
knowledge as to what they should and
 
01:49:45.649 --> 01:49:45.659 align:start position:0%
shouldn't pass small farmers maybe they
 
01:49:47.930 --> 01:49:47.940 align:start position:0%
do maybe they don't other states they'll
 
01:49:49.850 --> 01:49:49.860 align:start position:0%
they track down to eight ounces and the
 
01:49:51.290 --> 01:49:51.300 align:start position:0%
reason is
 
01:49:51.300 --> 01:49:52.129 align:start position:0%
reason is
um

01:49:52.129 --> 01:49:52.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:54.050 --> 01:49:54.060 align:start position:0%
you have 50 pounds of eight ounce
 
01:49:55.970 --> 01:49:55.980 align:start position:0%
packets that people are trading at
 
01:49:57.470 --> 01:49:57.480 align:start position:0%
whether it's a farmer's market or
 
01:50:00.109 --> 01:50:00.119 align:start position:0%
selling I I believe this has to do with
 
01:50:02.709 --> 01:50:02.719 align:start position:0%
sales and not trades I don't know
 
01:50:05.390 --> 01:50:05.400 align:start position:0%
but once you start uh trading eight
 
01:50:07.609 --> 01:50:07.619 align:start position:0%
ounce packets up to 50 pounds if if
 
01:50:10.189 --> 01:50:10.199 align:start position:0%
there's something in that lot that's
 
01:50:13.070 --> 01:50:13.080 align:start position:0%
been distributed in that fashion now
 
01:50:14.530 --> 01:50:14.540 align:start position:0%
it's distributed across the whole state
 
01:50:17.510 --> 01:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
potentially so uh somebody brought that
 
01:50:20.689 --> 01:50:20.699 align:start position:0%
up SE one thing I can think off the top
 
01:50:22.189 --> 01:50:22.199 align:start position:0%
of my head that you just want to be
 
01:50:25.070 --> 01:50:25.080 align:start position:0%
aware of that you know a 50 pound
 
01:50:27.050 --> 01:50:27.060 align:start position:0%
distribution of carrot seeds for
 
01:50:28.370 --> 01:50:28.380 align:start position:0%
instance are going to be significantly
 
01:50:31.250 --> 01:50:31.260 align:start position:0%
different than a 50 pound distribution
 
01:50:34.930 --> 01:50:34.940 align:start position:0%
of beans via eight ounce packages right
 
01:50:37.910 --> 01:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
or however it gets done and and I only
 
01:50:39.649 --> 01:50:39.659 align:start position:0%
point out eight ounce because that's how
 
01:50:41.390 --> 01:50:41.400 align:start position:0%
it is in another state that I saw was
 
01:50:43.609 --> 01:50:43.619 align:start position:0%
trying to review for the other uh
 
01:50:45.470 --> 01:50:45.480 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
01:50:51.050 --> 01:50:51.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:53.209 --> 01:50:53.219 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
01:50:56.090 --> 01:50:56.100 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby uh could you just
 
01:50:59.090 --> 01:50:59.100 align:start position:0%
spell out what ASCO stands for
 
01:50:59.100 --> 01:51:07.430 align:start position:0%
spell out what ASCO stands for
absolutely

01:51:07.430 --> 01:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:10.189 --> 01:51:10.199 align:start position:0%
State seed
 
01:51:12.890 --> 01:51:12.900 align:start position:0%
uh certification officials
 
01:51:15.470 --> 01:51:15.480 align:start position:0%
Association of State seed certification
 
01:51:20.870 --> 01:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:20.880 --> 01:51:22.490 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:51:22.490 --> 01:51:22.500 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:51:25.189 --> 01:51:25.199 align:start position:0%
and Russell is uh recommended uniform
 
01:51:32.330 --> 01:51:32.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:35.470 --> 01:51:35.480 align:start position:0%
so Association of State seed
 
01:51:38.030 --> 01:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
certification officials okay I believe
 
01:51:41.050 --> 01:51:41.060 align:start position:0%
so yes and if you were to Google
 
01:51:45.229 --> 01:51:45.239 align:start position:0%
assco you would get the exact uh I just
 
01:51:46.970 --> 01:51:46.980 align:start position:0%
want to caution you that I don't have it
 
01:51:49.010 --> 01:51:49.020 align:start position:0%
in front of me
 
01:51:51.470 --> 01:51:51.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:51:55.550 --> 01:51:55.560 align:start position:0%
any other questions for Mr Wyman I do
 
01:51:58.370 --> 01:51:58.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:01.550 --> 01:52:01.560 align:start position:0%
if this was bumped up to 30 pounds would
 
01:52:03.770 --> 01:52:03.780 align:start position:0%
that be an issue
 
01:52:05.810 --> 01:52:05.820 align:start position:0%
again without having further discussions
 
01:52:07.850 --> 01:52:07.860 align:start position:0%
with the other C uh Law Enforcement
 
01:52:10.550 --> 01:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
Officers throughout the country I I am
 
01:52:13.250 --> 01:52:13.260 align:start position:0%
reticent to speak to this
 
01:52:15.709 --> 01:52:15.719 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:52:19.790 --> 01:52:19.800 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby uh have you had any
 
01:52:25.430 --> 01:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:28.609 --> 01:52:28.619 align:start position:0%
not specific to the to the pound of seed
 
01:52:28.619 --> 01:52:30.050 align:start position:0%
not specific to the to the pound of seed
no

01:52:30.050 --> 01:52:30.060 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:52:32.450 --> 01:52:32.460 align:start position:0%
hold on follow-up have you had
 
01:52:36.709 --> 01:52:36.719 align:start position:0%
enforcement uh any enforcement uh cases
 
01:52:38.450 --> 01:52:38.460 align:start position:0%
related to
 
01:52:42.229 --> 01:52:42.239 align:start position:0%
um distribution of uh seeds on a small
 
01:52:43.910 --> 01:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
scale as opposed to you know what you
 
01:52:46.189 --> 01:52:46.199 align:start position:0%
would get from say Burpee or off
 
01:52:46.199 --> 01:52:52.129 align:start position:0%
would get from say Burpee or off
Johnny's

01:52:52.129 --> 01:52:52.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:54.050 --> 01:52:54.060 align:start position:0%
typically when that occurs it's because
 
01:52:56.450 --> 01:52:56.460 align:start position:0%
we've noted a violation either in
 
01:52:59.510 --> 01:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
labeling or or in date of sales and we
 
01:53:01.129 --> 01:53:01.139 align:start position:0%
go back to the database to try to figure
 
01:53:01.139 --> 01:53:02.030 align:start position:0%
go back to the database to try to figure
out

01:53:02.030 --> 01:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:53:04.250 --> 01:53:04.260 align:start position:0%
who the registrant is and that's when we
 
01:53:05.570 --> 01:53:05.580 align:start position:0%
find out if there is or is not a
 
01:53:07.070 --> 01:53:07.080 align:start position:0%
registering if we're speaking
 
01:53:08.930 --> 01:53:08.940 align:start position:0%
specifically to the registration piece
 
01:53:10.669 --> 01:53:10.679 align:start position:0%
of this
 
01:53:13.550 --> 01:53:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:17.390 --> 01:53:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:19.550 --> 01:53:19.560 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
 
01:53:21.770 --> 01:53:21.780 align:start position:0%
testimony this morning thank you and I
 
01:53:24.229 --> 01:53:24.239 align:start position:0%
call Stephen Nass
 
01:53:34.330 --> 01:53:34.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:36.770 --> 01:53:36.780 align:start position:0%
welcome good morning thanks for having
 
01:53:38.990 --> 01:53:39.000 align:start position:0%
me back up here again again I'm Stephen
 
01:53:41.930 --> 01:53:41.940 align:start position:0%
nass I'm restaurant owner and Chef I
 
01:53:44.930 --> 01:53:44.940 align:start position:0%
also grew up on a very small farm and we
 
01:53:47.870 --> 01:53:47.880 align:start position:0%
constantly looked for ways for our our
 
01:53:49.910 --> 01:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
little farm to make money and look for
 
01:53:52.609 --> 01:53:52.619 align:start position:0%
opportunity and I really think
 
01:53:55.189 --> 01:53:55.199 align:start position:0%
um with this bill the two things that
 
01:53:56.870 --> 01:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
you should keep in mind would be
 
01:53:59.990 --> 01:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity and resiliency opportunity
 
01:54:04.430 --> 01:54:04.440 align:start position:0%
in that any time we deregulate or expand
 
01:54:06.770 --> 01:54:06.780 align:start position:0%
how much product our small farmers in
 
01:54:08.689 --> 01:54:08.699 align:start position:0%
the state can produce and sell it's
 
01:54:10.729 --> 01:54:10.739 align:start position:0%
creating more opportunity for them in
 
01:54:12.830 --> 01:54:12.840 align:start position:0%
ways that are unseen there might be
 
01:54:14.990 --> 01:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
people out there that would that would
 
01:54:16.850 --> 01:54:16.860 align:start position:0%
look at selling seeds and collecting
 
01:54:19.129 --> 01:54:19.139 align:start position:0%
them but they do the math and they say
 
01:54:22.189 --> 01:54:22.199 align:start position:0%
that 25 pounds is not enough because if
 
01:54:24.709 --> 01:54:24.719 align:start position:0%
we're talking eight ounces eight ounce
 
01:54:27.890 --> 01:54:27.900 align:start position:0%
bags that's maybe 50 bags that might not
 
01:54:29.030 --> 01:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
be enough for them to make it worth
 
01:54:31.070 --> 01:54:31.080 align:start position:0%
their while versus if we increase the
 
01:54:31.080 --> 01:54:31.970 align:start position:0%
their while versus if we increase the
amount

01:54:31.970 --> 01:54:31.980 align:start position:0%
amount
 
01:54:33.770 --> 01:54:33.780 align:start position:0%
suddenly it's profitable part of their
 
01:54:35.750 --> 01:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
business that they can expand on and
 
01:54:38.390 --> 01:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
then as far as resiliency goes uh the
 
01:54:40.910 --> 01:54:40.920 align:start position:0%
representative spoke about uh the supply
 
01:54:42.649 --> 01:54:42.659 align:start position:0%
chain issues that we've had in the past
 
01:54:44.870 --> 01:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
and we're definitely still ongoing with
 
01:54:46.729 --> 01:54:46.739 align:start position:0%
those and I think that anything we can
 
01:54:50.030 --> 01:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
do to make our own State more resilient
 
01:54:53.390 --> 01:54:53.400 align:start position:0%
and and enable our Farmers to save their
 
01:54:55.370 --> 01:54:55.380 align:start position:0%
seeds and trade amongst each other and
 
01:54:58.129 --> 01:54:58.139 align:start position:0%
by trade I mean selling to each other uh
 
01:55:00.709 --> 01:55:00.719 align:start position:0%
I think is going to be uh
 
01:55:02.629 --> 01:55:02.639 align:start position:0%
much more beneficial to us in the long
 
01:55:04.070 --> 01:55:04.080 align:start position:0%
run and it's going to be hard to put
 
01:55:06.229 --> 01:55:06.239 align:start position:0%
solid numbers on exactly what those
 
01:55:08.930 --> 01:55:08.940 align:start position:0%
benefits are but uh I think subjectively
 
01:55:11.149 --> 01:55:11.159 align:start position:0%
going to the stores and going to the
 
01:55:12.709 --> 01:55:12.719 align:start position:0%
markets we'll see the results of those
 
01:55:12.719 --> 01:55:14.209 align:start position:0%
markets we'll see the results of those
things

01:55:14.209 --> 01:55:14.219 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:55:14.219 --> 01:55:14.990 align:start position:0%
things
um

01:55:14.990 --> 01:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:17.270 --> 01:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
there is a talk about
 
01:55:20.510 --> 01:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
um this being a solution in search of a
 
01:55:22.070 --> 01:55:22.080 align:start position:0%
problem and like I said I don't really
 
01:55:24.290 --> 01:55:24.300 align:start position:0%
see it that way I see this as creating
 
01:55:26.629 --> 01:55:26.639 align:start position:0%
those opportunities and if we're talking
 
01:55:29.629 --> 01:55:29.639 align:start position:0%
about enforcement of uh the seed
 
01:55:31.609 --> 01:55:31.619 align:start position:0%
labeling bills the only concerns I've
 
01:55:33.410 --> 01:55:33.420 align:start position:0%
seen brought up today
 
01:55:36.530 --> 01:55:36.540 align:start position:0%
um by the previous speaker uh would be
 
01:55:38.990 --> 01:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
dealing with the red tape if mislabeling
 
01:55:41.330 --> 01:55:41.340 align:start position:0%
or confusion about when the seeds were
 
01:55:43.310 --> 01:55:43.320 align:start position:0%
produced and I think at the end of the
 
01:55:45.950 --> 01:55:45.960 align:start position:0%
day uh nobody's going to if we're
 
01:55:48.290 --> 01:55:48.300 align:start position:0%
talking small farmers selling seeds to
 
01:55:50.030 --> 01:55:50.040 align:start position:0%
each other
 
01:55:50.040 --> 01:55:50.570 align:start position:0%
each other
um

01:55:50.570 --> 01:55:50.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:54.169 --> 01:55:54.179 align:start position:0%
nobody has a greater uh liability or
 
01:55:56.930 --> 01:55:56.940 align:start position:0%
desire for the product to be good than
 
01:55:59.030 --> 01:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
those two farmers and that plays again
 
01:56:01.490 --> 01:56:01.500 align:start position:0%
into if we're worried about invasive
 
01:56:03.830 --> 01:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
species these are these are small
 
01:56:06.649 --> 01:56:06.659 align:start position:0%
farmers selling to each other uh the
 
01:56:09.169 --> 01:56:09.179 align:start position:0%
state has uh less of
 
01:56:09.179 --> 01:56:09.770 align:start position:0%
state has uh less of
um

01:56:09.770 --> 01:56:09.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:12.830 --> 01:56:12.840 align:start position:0%
a desire for those invasive species to
 
01:56:16.370 --> 01:56:16.380 align:start position:0%
be spread than uh the concerns that the
 
01:56:17.510 --> 01:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
farmers themselves are going to be
 
01:56:20.990 --> 01:56:21.000 align:start position:0%
having so I think to say that uh
 
01:56:24.109 --> 01:56:24.119 align:start position:0%
to put to uh put these keep DC graduate
 
01:56:26.510 --> 01:56:26.520 align:start position:0%
regulations around and keep keep them as
 
01:56:28.490 --> 01:56:28.500 align:start position:0%
expansive as they are
 
01:56:30.950 --> 01:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
um as opposed to giving the power back
 
01:56:34.250 --> 01:56:34.260 align:start position:0%
to the farmers themselves uh is a bit of
 
01:56:36.350 --> 01:56:36.360 align:start position:0%
an absurd statement to me
 
01:56:38.209 --> 01:56:38.219 align:start position:0%
uh so again I just want you guys to
 
01:56:40.550 --> 01:56:40.560 align:start position:0%
think about the opportunity that uh
 
01:56:42.410 --> 01:56:42.420 align:start position:0%
growing the amount of seeds that can be
 
01:56:44.810 --> 01:56:44.820 align:start position:0%
sailed or sold uh is going to bring to
 
01:56:46.910 --> 01:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
our state and then again resiliency
 
01:56:49.070 --> 01:56:49.080 align:start position:0%
amongst our farming community and our
 
01:56:51.169 --> 01:56:51.179 align:start position:0%
Network thank you
 
01:56:54.890 --> 01:56:54.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Nas representative Knapp
 
01:56:56.870 --> 01:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um
 
01:56:58.669 --> 01:56:58.679 align:start position:0%
I have a question sort of about the seed
 
01:57:00.229 --> 01:57:00.239 align:start position:0%
testing piece because these are nice
 
01:57:01.729 --> 01:57:01.739 align:start position:0%
stories about people selling seeds to
 
01:57:03.590 --> 01:57:03.600 align:start position:0%
each other but as anyone here who has a
 
01:57:05.330 --> 01:57:05.340 align:start position:0%
garden knows if I gave you some tomato
 
01:57:06.830 --> 01:57:06.840 align:start position:0%
seeds you'll probably get some like
 
01:57:09.050 --> 01:57:09.060 align:start position:0%
generic grape tomato that doesn't taste
 
01:57:11.330 --> 01:57:11.340 align:start position:0%
very good so you have a lot of plants
 
01:57:13.609 --> 01:57:13.619 align:start position:0%
that like really cross-pollinate and
 
01:57:15.770 --> 01:57:15.780 align:start position:0%
people who grow seeds for those plants
 
01:57:17.209 --> 01:57:17.219 align:start position:0%
you know they're isolating them they're
 
01:57:18.709 --> 01:57:18.719 align:start position:0%
not just like pulling tomato seeds out
 
01:57:21.229 --> 01:57:21.239 align:start position:0%
of their yard so I mean is there a piece
 
01:57:22.609 --> 01:57:22.619 align:start position:0%
like is there a truth and advertising
 
01:57:25.430 --> 01:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
piece to seed selling that if I sell you
 
01:57:27.350 --> 01:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
Tomatoes or pumpkins they're really
 
01:57:29.390 --> 01:57:29.400 align:start position:0%
going to be what I say they are
 
01:57:31.609 --> 01:57:31.619 align:start position:0%
I think definitely I mean if you want to
 
01:57:34.370 --> 01:57:34.380 align:start position:0%
continue selling those seeds again then
 
01:57:35.689 --> 01:57:35.699 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to be truthful the
 
01:57:36.950 --> 01:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
first time you do it or we're not going
 
01:57:38.810 --> 01:57:38.820 align:start position:0%
to you know the second person's not
 
01:57:40.910 --> 01:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
going to be buying from you again and I
 
01:57:43.189 --> 01:57:43.199 align:start position:0%
I do think we didn't touch on
 
01:57:46.010 --> 01:57:46.020 align:start position:0%
um how beneficial it is to be selling
 
01:57:47.510 --> 01:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
seeds to your neighbors because rather
 
01:57:50.030 --> 01:57:50.040 align:start position:0%
than buying from these uh big
 
01:57:52.250 --> 01:57:52.260 align:start position:0%
International companies you're buying
 
01:57:54.229 --> 01:57:54.239 align:start position:0%
seeds that you know can be grown in your
 
01:57:56.209 --> 01:57:56.219 align:start position:0%
area because the person you're buying
 
01:57:57.709 --> 01:57:57.719 align:start position:0%
them from actually grew them in your
 
01:57:59.750 --> 01:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
area and you're more likely to get the
 
01:58:01.669 --> 01:58:01.679 align:start position:0%
product that you want
 
01:58:01.679 --> 01:58:03.910 align:start position:0%
product that you want
um

01:58:03.910 --> 01:58:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:06.410 --> 01:58:06.420 align:start position:0%
representative germanna thank you madam
 
01:58:07.970 --> 01:58:07.980 align:start position:0%
chair uh and thank you for coming in
 
01:58:10.609 --> 01:58:10.619 align:start position:0%
today and and talking to us uh so my
 
01:58:12.290 --> 01:58:12.300 align:start position:0%
question is you know we're talking about
 
01:58:15.290 --> 01:58:15.300 align:start position:0%
say 25 pounds versus 50 pounds what
 
01:58:18.589 --> 01:58:18.599 align:start position:0%
evidence we haven't seen any to tell us
 
01:58:21.169 --> 01:58:21.179 align:start position:0%
why it should be 50 instead of 25 would
 
01:58:22.850 --> 01:58:22.860 align:start position:0%
it be safe to say that in your opinion
 
01:58:24.890 --> 01:58:24.900 align:start position:0%
we just shouldn't regulate this at all
 
01:58:27.229 --> 01:58:27.239 align:start position:0%
and there would be no limit uh and I
 
01:58:28.669 --> 01:58:28.679 align:start position:0%
mean in my opinion
 
01:58:31.010 --> 01:58:31.020 align:start position:0%
my personal opinion any sort of
 
01:58:33.649 --> 01:58:33.659 align:start position:0%
Regulation like this should be desired
 
01:58:36.709 --> 01:58:36.719 align:start position:0%
by the buyer or the seller and not
 
01:58:39.169 --> 01:58:39.179 align:start position:0%
imposed on them by the state itself in
 
01:58:39.179 --> 01:58:40.310 align:start position:0%
imposed on them by the state itself in
advance

01:58:40.310 --> 01:58:40.320 align:start position:0%
advance
 
01:58:42.470 --> 01:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
um because that strikes me as a law
 
01:58:44.930 --> 01:58:44.940 align:start position:0%
looking for a problem like you had
 
01:58:46.970 --> 01:58:46.980 align:start position:0%
spoken a bit about before
 
01:58:46.980 --> 01:58:47.810 align:start position:0%
spoken a bit about before
um

01:58:47.810 --> 01:58:47.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:49.370 --> 01:58:49.380 align:start position:0%
yeah that's that'd be my personal
 
01:58:49.380 --> 01:58:53.629 align:start position:0%
yeah that's that'd be my personal
opinion

01:58:53.629 --> 01:58:53.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:56.990 --> 01:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
can I ask a follow-up yes sir uh but
 
01:58:59.030 --> 01:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that end up if we're talking
 
01:59:01.070 --> 01:59:01.080 align:start position:0%
about and I understand and I appreciate
 
01:59:02.149 --> 01:59:02.159 align:start position:0%
your argument about increasing
 
01:59:04.490 --> 01:59:04.500 align:start position:0%
opportunity but then don't we also got
 
01:59:06.709 --> 01:59:06.719 align:start position:0%
to a point where it overly benefits
 
01:59:08.689 --> 01:59:08.699 align:start position:0%
large producers of seeds as opposed to
 
01:59:11.149 --> 01:59:11.159 align:start position:0%
small producers of seeds uh because then
 
01:59:13.129 --> 01:59:13.139 align:start position:0%
they could produce and sell large
 
01:59:16.729 --> 01:59:16.739 align:start position:0%
quantities of seeds without having to go
 
01:59:18.589 --> 01:59:18.599 align:start position:0%
through these regulatory processes and
 
01:59:20.030 --> 01:59:20.040 align:start position:0%
guarantee the quality of their product
 
01:59:21.649 --> 01:59:21.659 align:start position:0%
doesn't it in the end then benefit
 
01:59:24.229 --> 01:59:24.239 align:start position:0%
larger producers if we simply expand
 
01:59:26.570 --> 01:59:26.580 align:start position:0%
that cap yeah I would see larger
 
01:59:29.510 --> 01:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
producers have a lot more uh financially
 
01:59:32.149 --> 01:59:32.159 align:start position:0%
at stake for selling the correct product
 
01:59:34.910 --> 01:59:34.920 align:start position:0%
that they say is going to be sold so if
 
01:59:36.530 --> 01:59:36.540 align:start position:0%
they're if a large producer is out there
 
01:59:40.310 --> 01:59:40.320 align:start position:0%
selling seed that uh is not what they
 
01:59:42.290 --> 01:59:42.300 align:start position:0%
say that is on the label they're opening
 
01:59:45.589 --> 01:59:45.599 align:start position:0%
themselves up to lawsuits and also uh
 
01:59:49.850 --> 01:59:49.860 align:start position:0%
the the customer reviews and the uh
 
01:59:51.830 --> 01:59:51.840 align:start position:0%
the buying process is going to decrease
 
01:59:53.930 --> 01:59:53.940 align:start position:0%
for those companies because their
 
01:59:56.750 --> 01:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
product is unreliable if you bought
 
01:59:59.570 --> 01:59:59.580 align:start position:0%
seeds from uh if you bought tomato seeds
 
02:00:01.910 --> 02:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
from a major corporation and you plant
 
02:00:03.890 --> 02:00:03.900 align:start position:0%
them and either they didn't grow because
 
02:00:06.589 --> 02:00:06.599 align:start position:0%
they were too old or they were just the
 
02:00:08.390 --> 02:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
wrong product you're not going back to
 
02:00:10.370 --> 02:00:10.380 align:start position:0%
them again so they actually they have
 
02:00:12.530 --> 02:00:12.540 align:start position:0%
their own incentives for making sure
 
02:00:14.870 --> 02:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
that the product is correct and I don't
 
02:00:18.530 --> 02:00:18.540 align:start position:0%
see any large seed producer not having
 
02:00:21.709 --> 02:00:21.719 align:start position:0%
testing done above and beyond
 
02:00:23.510 --> 02:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
what our state is doing on its own
 
02:00:23.520 --> 02:00:25.370 align:start position:0%
what our state is doing on its own
anyway

02:00:25.370 --> 02:00:25.380 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
02:00:28.669 --> 02:00:28.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:30.770 --> 02:00:30.780 align:start position:0%
representative Murray
 
02:00:33.649 --> 02:00:33.659 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair for taking
 
02:00:36.470 --> 02:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
my question have you or uh the
 
02:00:37.970 --> 02:00:37.980 align:start position:0%
representative had any conversations
 
02:00:39.530 --> 02:00:39.540 align:start position:0%
with other stakeholders like the Farm
 
02:00:43.609 --> 02:00:43.619 align:start position:0%
Bureau to understand how this may impact
 
02:00:45.830 --> 02:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
organizations such as that
 
02:00:48.470 --> 02:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
no I have not had any contact with uh
 
02:00:51.410 --> 02:00:51.420 align:start position:0%
other organizations outside the state my
 
02:00:54.350 --> 02:00:54.360 align:start position:0%
my focus is on communicating directly
 
02:00:57.050 --> 02:00:57.060 align:start position:0%
with the local farmers in this state and
 
02:00:59.330 --> 02:00:59.340 align:start position:0%
and those people uh in my restaurant
 
02:01:01.729 --> 02:01:01.739 align:start position:0%
it's very farm to table so I interact
 
02:01:03.470 --> 02:01:03.480 align:start position:0%
with Farmers constantly and we actually
 
02:01:05.570 --> 02:01:05.580 align:start position:0%
have a monthly meet up for farmers and
 
02:01:08.149 --> 02:01:08.159 align:start position:0%
homesteaders so I get voice concerns
 
02:01:09.530 --> 02:01:09.540 align:start position:0%
directly from them
 
02:01:11.930 --> 02:01:11.940 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:01:14.870 --> 02:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Nas any other questions
 
02:01:17.089 --> 02:01:17.099 align:start position:0%
from the committee no thank you
 
02:01:19.669 --> 02:01:19.679 align:start position:0%
appreciate your testimony and I have one
 
02:01:21.890 --> 02:01:21.900 align:start position:0%
more pink card from commissioner Jasper
 
02:01:26.750 --> 02:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:31.070 --> 02:01:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:32.570 --> 02:01:32.580 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
 
02:01:35.570 --> 02:01:35.580 align:start position:0%
committee I didn't have any intent to
 
02:01:38.290 --> 02:01:38.300 align:start position:0%
testify on this bill
 
02:01:41.510 --> 02:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
director Wyman covered our concerns
 
02:01:44.990 --> 02:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
however previous testimony sort of
 
02:01:47.390 --> 02:01:47.400 align:start position:0%
sparked sparked me to come up here I I
 
02:01:49.370 --> 02:01:49.380 align:start position:0%
think by the nature of some of the
 
02:01:52.310 --> 02:01:52.320 align:start position:0%
questions I think the committee does get
 
02:01:56.030 --> 02:01:56.040 align:start position:0%
this uh issue
 
02:01:59.510 --> 02:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
but one of the things that was just
 
02:02:02.330 --> 02:02:02.340 align:start position:0%
um said really sort of got me to
 
02:02:04.609 --> 02:02:04.619 align:start position:0%
thinking and that was the regulations
 
02:02:06.830 --> 02:02:06.840 align:start position:0%
should be promulgated and laws should be
 
02:02:08.689 --> 02:02:08.699 align:start position:0%
promulgated because there's a need by
 
02:02:11.629 --> 02:02:11.639 align:start position:0%
the the buyers and the and the sellers
 
02:02:14.750 --> 02:02:14.760 align:start position:0%
to have that we don't know and I would
 
02:02:17.030 --> 02:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
actually suspect that that is exactly
 
02:02:19.669 --> 02:02:19.679 align:start position:0%
why this law is in place but there was
 
02:02:22.669 --> 02:02:22.679 align:start position:0%
no evidence that some legislator just
 
02:02:24.550 --> 02:02:24.560 align:start position:0%
thought this would be a good idea to do
 
02:02:28.310 --> 02:02:28.320 align:start position:0%
decades ago so people ought to have the
 
02:02:30.709 --> 02:02:30.719 align:start position:0%
research before they say that just
 
02:02:32.270 --> 02:02:32.280 align:start position:0%
because it happened a long time ago
 
02:02:34.490 --> 02:02:34.500 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that it wasn't because
 
02:02:36.530 --> 02:02:36.540 align:start position:0%
there was a problem
 
02:02:38.330 --> 02:02:38.340 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
02:02:41.570 --> 02:02:41.580 align:start position:0%
that's sort of I guess offends me as a
 
02:02:44.209 --> 02:02:44.219 align:start position:0%
former legislator that that's what
 
02:02:45.950 --> 02:02:45.960 align:start position:0%
legislators spend their time doing is
 
02:02:48.470 --> 02:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
just looking for a solution to a problem
 
02:02:50.390 --> 02:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
that doesn't exist I would suggest there
 
02:02:52.250 --> 02:02:52.260 align:start position:0%
probably was a problem
 
02:02:54.950 --> 02:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
the other thing that that really got me
 
02:02:56.689 --> 02:02:56.699 align:start position:0%
thinking is
 
02:02:58.209 --> 02:02:58.219 align:start position:0%
the previous
 
02:03:00.649 --> 02:03:00.659 align:start position:0%
individual who testified
 
02:03:04.089 --> 02:03:04.099 align:start position:0%
isn't a buyer or a seller of seeds
 
02:03:07.609 --> 02:03:07.619 align:start position:0%
and if there was a need to change this
 
02:03:07.619 --> 02:03:08.689 align:start position:0%
and if there was a need to change this
law

02:03:08.689 --> 02:03:08.699 align:start position:0%
law
 
02:03:11.810 --> 02:03:11.820 align:start position:0%
I would have expected to see those small
 
02:03:14.750 --> 02:03:14.760 align:start position:0%
sellers in here telling us why this
 
02:03:18.609 --> 02:03:18.619 align:start position:0%
current amount is uh is a problem
 
02:03:18.619 --> 02:03:20.229 align:start position:0%
current amount is uh is a problem
representative

02:03:20.229 --> 02:03:20.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:03:23.990 --> 02:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
director Wyman did indicate that there
 
02:03:26.570 --> 02:03:26.580 align:start position:0%
are certainly a huge difference between
 
02:03:26.580 --> 02:03:28.390 align:start position:0%
are certainly a huge difference between
25

02:03:28.390 --> 02:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
25
 
02:03:30.189 --> 02:03:30.199 align:start position:0%
pounds of
 
02:03:33.410 --> 02:03:33.420 align:start position:0%
bean seeds and 25 pounds of carrot seed
 
02:03:36.589 --> 02:03:36.599 align:start position:0%
so if if there was an issue then perhaps
 
02:03:39.050 --> 02:03:39.060 align:start position:0%
a different category I don't think we
 
02:03:41.450 --> 02:03:41.460 align:start position:0%
could if if the committee is interested
 
02:03:45.350 --> 02:03:45.360 align:start position:0%
in bumping this up to to 50 50 pounds
 
02:03:47.870 --> 02:03:47.880 align:start position:0%
maybe there ought to be a different
 
02:03:52.010 --> 02:03:52.020 align:start position:0%
category just like we do in pet vending
 
02:03:55.010 --> 02:03:55.020 align:start position:0%
you know you have a different number for
 
02:03:59.149 --> 02:03:59.159 align:start position:0%
fish that you sell versus dogs so really
 
02:04:01.910 --> 02:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
in terms of size it's not dissimilar so
 
02:04:04.370 --> 02:04:04.380 align:start position:0%
just my thoughts thank you
 
02:04:06.470 --> 02:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr commissioner any other
 
02:04:08.510 --> 02:04:08.520 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
02:04:10.850 --> 02:04:10.860 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and appreciate
 
02:04:10.860 --> 02:04:11.830 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and appreciate
it

02:04:11.830 --> 02:04:11.840 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:04:15.290 --> 02:04:15.300 align:start position:0%
I don't see any other pink cards or
 
02:04:19.010 --> 02:04:19.020 align:start position:0%
folks if anybody is interested in making
 
02:04:21.169 --> 02:04:21.179 align:start position:0%
further comment please let yourself be
 
02:04:21.179 --> 02:04:23.810 align:start position:0%
further comment please let yourself be
known

02:04:23.810 --> 02:04:23.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:32.510 --> 02:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:36.169 --> 02:04:36.179 align:start position:0%
we have one person in favor of this
 
02:04:41.649 --> 02:04:41.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:45.530 --> 02:04:45.540 align:start position:0%
one in favor and three opposed
 
02:04:48.470 --> 02:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
so with that I am going to close the
 
02:05:04.490 --> 02:05:04.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:08.450 --> 02:05:08.460 align:start position:0%
yeah well I think we uh we can talk
 
02:05:11.450 --> 02:05:11.460 align:start position:0%
about all of the bills at the end of
 
02:05:13.910 --> 02:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
today and see where everybody is on them
 
02:05:16.250 --> 02:05:16.260 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
02:05:18.770 --> 02:05:18.780 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to close this hearing on
 
02:05:18.780 --> 02:05:21.169 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to close this hearing on
hb128

02:05:21.169 --> 02:05:21.179 align:start position:0%
hb128
 
02:05:23.330 --> 02:05:23.340 align:start position:0%
and we are going to break for lunch and
 
02:06:07.729 --> 02:06:07.739 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:07.739 --> 03:06:05.690 align:start position:0%
 
difficult

03:06:05.690 --> 03:06:05.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:05.700 --> 03:06:09.730 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:06:09.730 --> 03:06:09.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:14.690 --> 03:06:14.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:22.370 --> 03:06:22.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:26.870 --> 03:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:30.190 --> 03:06:30.200 align:start position:0%
all right uh we are on
 
03:06:35.530 --> 03:06:35.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:48.590 --> 03:06:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:51.530 --> 03:06:51.540 align:start position:0%
and we have uh representative McGee here
 
03:06:54.650 --> 03:06:54.660 align:start position:0%
to introduce this bill HB 369
 
03:06:57.530 --> 03:06:57.540 align:start position:0%
establishing a task force to provide
 
03:07:00.469 --> 03:07:00.479 align:start position:0%
energy relief on farms good afternoon
 
03:07:03.710 --> 03:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
representative good afternoon chairwoman
 
03:07:05.570 --> 03:07:05.580 align:start position:0%
um Aaron thank you
 
03:07:08.630 --> 03:07:08.640 align:start position:0%
appreciate you having me here today
 
03:07:11.030 --> 03:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
I come here today to ask for your
 
03:07:14.150 --> 03:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
support in passing HB 369 to help New
 
03:07:16.309 --> 03:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire form a sunlit Farm's energy
 
03:07:19.130 --> 03:07:19.140 align:start position:0%
relief task force to investigate the
 
03:07:21.110 --> 03:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
potential for funding solar-powered
 
03:07:23.090 --> 03:07:23.100 align:start position:0%
farming with monies from the inflation
 
03:07:24.650 --> 03:07:24.660 align:start position:0%
reduction Act
 
03:07:26.510 --> 03:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
a significant chunk of those federal
 
03:07:28.370 --> 03:07:28.380 align:start position:0%
dollars are intended to help States
 
03:07:31.070 --> 03:07:31.080 align:start position:0%
increase Energy Efficiency and convert
 
03:07:33.889 --> 03:07:33.899 align:start position:0%
to more sustainable energy practices
 
03:07:36.050 --> 03:07:36.060 align:start position:0%
the idea of focusing on farms came from
 
03:07:38.690 --> 03:07:38.700 align:start position:0%
one of my constituents Trevor Hardy of
 
03:07:40.550 --> 03:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
Brookdale Fruit Farms in Hollis New
 
03:07:42.950 --> 03:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire representative Ming and I were
 
03:07:44.450 --> 03:07:44.460 align:start position:0%
attending an agricultural event at
 
03:07:46.370 --> 03:07:46.380 align:start position:0%
Woodmont Orchards for legislators when
 
03:07:49.610 --> 03:07:49.620 align:start position:0%
Hardy a Seventh Generation Hollis farmer
 
03:07:51.889 --> 03:07:51.899 align:start position:0%
asked why New Hampshire didn't offer tax
 
03:07:54.530 --> 03:07:54.540 align:start position:0%
credits to Farmers who install solar to
 
03:07:56.450 --> 03:07:56.460 align:start position:0%
power their Farms
 
03:07:58.610 --> 03:07:58.620 align:start position:0%
he had a friend who bought a competitive
 
03:08:01.610 --> 03:08:01.620 align:start position:0%
local Farm Kimball's most of whose land
 
03:08:03.830 --> 03:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
is located just over the Border in
 
03:08:07.429 --> 03:08:07.439 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and that farm came with
 
03:08:09.230 --> 03:08:09.240 align:start position:0%
tracking solar arrays
 
03:08:11.690 --> 03:08:11.700 align:start position:0%
and mass also allows net metering
 
03:08:14.929 --> 03:08:14.939 align:start position:0%
credits so Trevor's complaint was that
 
03:08:17.450 --> 03:08:17.460 align:start position:0%
uh his fellow farmer and friend had no
 
03:08:19.969 --> 03:08:19.979 align:start position:0%
electric bill while his utility costs
 
03:08:22.790 --> 03:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
were quite large and increasing due to
 
03:08:25.370 --> 03:08:25.380 align:start position:0%
what was happening in the market
 
03:08:28.790 --> 03:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
uh Kimball's entire Farm operation was
 
03:08:31.849 --> 03:08:31.859 align:start position:0%
powered by those solar arrays they were
 
03:08:35.510 --> 03:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
there was a large upfront investment but
 
03:08:37.670 --> 03:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
they were now yielding ongoing benefits
 
03:08:40.090 --> 03:08:40.100 align:start position:0%
to the cost of their operation
 
03:08:42.889 --> 03:08:42.899 align:start position:0%
that stabilized both the business and
 
03:08:44.809 --> 03:08:44.819 align:start position:0%
meant that prices to Consumers would
 
03:08:47.210 --> 03:08:47.220 align:start position:0%
also be held stable
 
03:08:48.889 --> 03:08:48.899 align:start position:0%
um in a time of inflation
 
03:08:51.950 --> 03:08:51.960 align:start position:0%
so I took my constituents question and
 
03:08:53.750 --> 03:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
tried to figure out if there was any way
 
03:08:55.309 --> 03:08:55.319 align:start position:0%
to come up with a bill that could help
 
03:08:57.950 --> 03:08:57.960 align:start position:0%
him and other New Hampshire farmers who
 
03:09:00.070 --> 03:09:00.080 align:start position:0%
have slim margins in their businesses
 
03:09:02.750 --> 03:09:02.760 align:start position:0%
and perform an essential service for New
 
03:09:04.969 --> 03:09:04.979 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's food economy
 
03:09:07.969 --> 03:09:07.979 align:start position:0%
uh cut to this fall when a
 
03:09:09.830 --> 03:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
representative of Senator Shaheen's
 
03:09:11.570 --> 03:09:11.580 align:start position:0%
office made a presentation to the Energy
 
03:09:13.849 --> 03:09:13.859 align:start position:0%
Efficiency and sustainable energy board
 
03:09:16.790 --> 03:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
known as the easy Board of which myself
 
03:09:18.590 --> 03:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
and the chair of my committee chairman
 
03:09:20.929 --> 03:09:20.939 align:start position:0%
Vose are members
 
03:09:23.150 --> 03:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
um speaker appointed members and that
 
03:09:24.830 --> 03:09:24.840 align:start position:0%
presentation covered high-level
 
03:09:26.510 --> 03:09:26.520 align:start position:0%
categories of money from the inflation
 
03:09:28.370 --> 03:09:28.380 align:start position:0%
reduction act that could help States
 
03:09:31.190 --> 03:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
transition to cleaner energy practices
 
03:09:33.110 --> 03:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
one of the categories mentioned was
 
03:09:35.630 --> 03:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
renewable agriculture but there was no
 
03:09:37.910 --> 03:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
specifics in terms of how you get at
 
03:09:40.429 --> 03:09:40.439 align:start position:0%
that renewable agriculture funding
 
03:09:41.750 --> 03:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
so I wondered whether the federal
 
03:09:43.610 --> 03:09:43.620 align:start position:0%
efforts to help achieve more renewable
 
03:09:45.349 --> 03:09:45.359 align:start position:0%
farming practices could help address
 
03:09:48.050 --> 03:09:48.060 align:start position:0%
Trevor Hardy's question and the plight
 
03:09:50.510 --> 03:09:50.520 align:start position:0%
of Many a New Hampshire grower who was
 
03:09:53.330 --> 03:09:53.340 align:start position:0%
seeing costs Skyrocket in a time when
 
03:09:55.849 --> 03:09:55.859 align:start position:0%
farms and Open Spaces are under
 
03:09:59.030 --> 03:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
increasing economic pressure
 
03:10:01.490 --> 03:10:01.500 align:start position:0%
it turns out farmers are quite concerned
 
03:10:03.349 --> 03:10:03.359 align:start position:0%
with warming temperatures and seasonal
 
03:10:05.690 --> 03:10:05.700 align:start position:0%
effects to farming so they are open to
 
03:10:08.090 --> 03:10:08.100 align:start position:0%
the idea of using some of their land to
 
03:10:10.070 --> 03:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
generate local clean power
 
03:10:13.070 --> 03:10:13.080 align:start position:0%
but The Upfront costs in most cases are
 
03:10:13.080 --> 03:10:14.630 align:start position:0%
but The Upfront costs in most cases are
prohibitive

03:10:14.630 --> 03:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
prohibitive
 
03:10:17.349 --> 03:10:17.359 align:start position:0%
so I called the New Hampshire USDA
 
03:10:19.429 --> 03:10:19.439 align:start position:0%
conservationists that I met at that
 
03:10:23.210 --> 03:10:23.220 align:start position:0%
Woodmont event to get more information
 
03:10:25.550 --> 03:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
for the bill that was forming in my mind
 
03:10:28.550 --> 03:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
and I received a call back from her
 
03:10:32.630 --> 03:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
today on my way to Concord which was
 
03:10:34.910 --> 03:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
really funny she had been out and didn't
 
03:10:37.010 --> 03:10:37.020 align:start position:0%
know that I called so we had a nice long
 
03:10:41.750 --> 03:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
chat and she is looking into
 
03:10:44.330 --> 03:10:44.340 align:start position:0%
um just so you know by way of History I
 
03:10:45.650 --> 03:10:45.660 align:start position:0%
I met with
 
03:10:47.210 --> 03:10:47.220 align:start position:0%
um commissioner Jasper who's behind me
 
03:10:49.550 --> 03:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
and going to testify as well
 
03:10:51.889 --> 03:10:51.899 align:start position:0%
um and both he and the department of
 
03:10:54.290 --> 03:10:54.300 align:start position:0%
energy had looked into the IRA funding
 
03:10:55.790 --> 03:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
and they didn't really see any place
 
03:10:57.590 --> 03:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
explicitly that they thought could be
 
03:10:59.809 --> 03:10:59.819 align:start position:0%
used for a program of this type
 
03:10:59.819 --> 03:11:01.070 align:start position:0%
used for a program of this type
so

03:11:01.070 --> 03:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:11:01.080 --> 03:11:01.670 align:start position:0%
so
um

03:11:01.670 --> 03:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:11:04.070 --> 03:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
you know it takes a lot of people to try
 
03:11:05.510 --> 03:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
and figure out what's going on with some
 
03:11:08.330 --> 03:11:08.340 align:start position:0%
of these really complex programs
 
03:11:11.150 --> 03:11:11.160 align:start position:0%
um but when she called back and this has
 
03:11:13.010 --> 03:11:13.020 align:start position:0%
been confirmed by Senator Shaheen's
 
03:11:15.349 --> 03:11:15.359 align:start position:0%
office who called me back today uh
 
03:11:16.969 --> 03:11:16.979 align:start position:0%
there's a program called the rural
 
03:11:20.630 --> 03:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
energy for America program reap
 
03:11:23.690 --> 03:11:23.700 align:start position:0%
and there's two billion dollars funded
 
03:11:26.990 --> 03:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
uh through the IRA in that program that
 
03:11:29.690 --> 03:11:29.700 align:start position:0%
is intended to assist with renewable
 
03:11:31.670 --> 03:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
energy and Energy Efficiency projects
 
03:11:35.090 --> 03:11:35.100 align:start position:0%
for Farms and so what they are telling
 
03:11:36.710 --> 03:11:36.720 align:start position:0%
us is that
 
03:11:39.349 --> 03:11:39.359 align:start position:0%
um in many cases the government is not
 
03:11:40.790 --> 03:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
trying the federal government is not
 
03:11:42.950 --> 03:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
trying to tell States what programs they
 
03:11:45.469 --> 03:11:45.479 align:start position:0%
have to design they are saying build it
 
03:11:47.210 --> 03:11:47.220 align:start position:0%
and we will come with the money so
 
03:11:49.490 --> 03:11:49.500 align:start position:0%
they're basically saying if you if you
 
03:11:51.889 --> 03:11:51.899 align:start position:0%
figure out how you need to spend the
 
03:11:53.809 --> 03:11:53.819 align:start position:0%
money we can supply money we have
 
03:11:55.250 --> 03:11:55.260 align:start position:0%
tranches of money
 
03:11:57.710 --> 03:11:57.720 align:start position:0%
so you can see the Dilemma is you know
 
03:11:59.929 --> 03:11:59.939 align:start position:0%
it's a cart before the horse thing
 
03:11:59.939 --> 03:12:00.530 align:start position:0%
it's a cart before the horse thing
um

03:12:00.530 --> 03:12:00.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:12:02.450 --> 03:12:02.460 align:start position:0%
so I did get calls back from both of
 
03:12:04.370 --> 03:12:04.380 align:start position:0%
those offices that I had been pending to
 
03:12:06.469 --> 03:12:06.479 align:start position:0%
hear from before I spoke with
 
03:12:08.690 --> 03:12:08.700 align:start position:0%
commissioner Jasper
 
03:12:12.410 --> 03:12:12.420 align:start position:0%
um and uh to his credit he did say if
 
03:12:13.670 --> 03:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
you can figure out where the money's
 
03:12:15.170 --> 03:12:15.180 align:start position:0%
coming from then we'll go forward with
 
03:12:15.180 --> 03:12:16.550 align:start position:0%
coming from then we'll go forward with
it

03:12:16.550 --> 03:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:12:18.290 --> 03:12:18.300 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:12:21.469 --> 03:12:21.479 align:start position:0%
um so basically the bill was uh as
 
03:12:25.309 --> 03:12:25.319 align:start position:0%
submitted had some weaknesses which uh
 
03:12:26.690 --> 03:12:26.700 align:start position:0%
commissioner Jasper brought to my
 
03:12:29.990 --> 03:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
attention turn around for a report was
 
03:12:31.490 --> 03:12:31.500 align:start position:0%
too aggressive I was looking at this
 
03:12:34.010 --> 03:12:34.020 align:start position:0%
year he's like we can't do that
 
03:12:36.230 --> 03:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
um and there were several other
 
03:12:36.240 --> 03:12:36.830 align:start position:0%
um and there were several other
um

03:12:36.830 --> 03:12:36.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:12:39.710 --> 03:12:39.720 align:start position:0%
pieces that came back uh from the in the
 
03:12:41.450 --> 03:12:41.460 align:start position:0%
time in the turnaround that I had to get
 
03:12:44.210 --> 03:12:44.220 align:start position:0%
the bill uh signed off
 
03:12:45.889 --> 03:12:45.899 align:start position:0%
um I I didn't have time to make it
 
03:12:48.830 --> 03:12:48.840 align:start position:0%
perfect but what I wanted to do since I
 
03:12:51.410 --> 03:12:51.420 align:start position:0%
had more information is I wanted to send
 
03:12:56.030 --> 03:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
around copies of edits uh for your
 
03:12:57.710 --> 03:12:57.720 align:start position:0%
consideration now that the bill is in
 
03:13:00.469 --> 03:13:00.479 align:start position:0%
your hands they're in red because for
 
03:13:02.570 --> 03:13:02.580 align:start position:0%
some reason my Acrobat Reader wouldn't
 
03:13:04.370 --> 03:13:04.380 align:start position:0%
let me do strikethroughs like they do in
 
03:13:07.790 --> 03:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
OLS so I made the changes and I I have
 
03:13:14.269 --> 03:13:14.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:14.279 --> 03:13:15.950 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:13:15.950 --> 03:13:15.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:13:19.670 --> 03:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
so what I would ask is that we
 
03:13:19.680 --> 03:13:20.330 align:start position:0%
so what I would ask is that we
um

03:13:20.330 --> 03:13:20.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:13:23.570 --> 03:13:23.580 align:start position:0%
understand that although it may not be
 
03:13:25.849 --> 03:13:25.859 align:start position:0%
clear to us
 
03:13:29.570 --> 03:13:29.580 align:start position:0%
um which monies can help our Farmers to
 
03:13:31.130 --> 03:13:31.140 align:start position:0%
lower their costs and to make
 
03:13:32.809 --> 03:13:32.819 align:start position:0%
investments that will keep energy
 
03:13:35.929 --> 03:13:35.939 align:start position:0%
dollars in New Hampshire and stabilize
 
03:13:39.590 --> 03:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
our food supply and those businesses and
 
03:13:40.969 --> 03:13:40.979 align:start position:0%
those lands which I think are all
 
03:13:43.190 --> 03:13:43.200 align:start position:0%
desirable things for us as a state to be
 
03:13:43.200 --> 03:13:45.110 align:start position:0%
desirable things for us as a state to be
considering

03:13:45.110 --> 03:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
considering
 
03:13:47.389 --> 03:13:47.399 align:start position:0%
um what I'm asking for in the bill is a
 
03:13:49.550 --> 03:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
task force that will further investigate
 
03:13:52.670 --> 03:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
this issue and so I never expected to
 
03:13:54.410 --> 03:13:54.420 align:start position:0%
have all the answers at the time of the
 
03:13:57.590 --> 03:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
hearing and I clearly do not
 
03:13:59.450 --> 03:13:59.460 align:start position:0%
um but with the edits that I'm giving
 
03:14:01.429 --> 03:14:01.439 align:start position:0%
you I think it is something that that
 
03:14:03.530 --> 03:14:03.540 align:start position:0%
could move forward and I did send all
 
03:14:06.650 --> 03:14:06.660 align:start position:0%
those edits out electronically to all
 
03:14:08.690 --> 03:14:08.700 align:start position:0%
the co-sponsors on the bill so with that
 
03:14:10.490 --> 03:14:10.500 align:start position:0%
if anyone has any questions
 
03:14:13.670 --> 03:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:16.269 --> 03:14:16.279 align:start position:0%
thank you representative McGee now
 
03:14:19.370 --> 03:14:19.380 align:start position:0%
excuse me I have this paper that was
 
03:14:21.349 --> 03:14:21.359 align:start position:0%
sent around and I there isn't enough for
 
03:14:23.570 --> 03:14:23.580 align:start position:0%
everybody apparently I'm a small
 
03:14:27.050 --> 03:14:27.060 align:start position:0%
operation yeah I I oh okay
 
03:14:28.610 --> 03:14:28.620 align:start position:0%
um and this is where you had some
 
03:14:31.429 --> 03:14:31.439 align:start position:0%
changes made in red yeah so you're not
 
03:14:34.670 --> 03:14:34.680 align:start position:0%
offering an amendment it's just
 
03:14:37.010 --> 03:14:37.020 align:start position:0%
changes I didn't have I didn't have time
 
03:14:38.990 --> 03:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
and I thought that if the since it's the
 
03:14:40.849 --> 03:14:40.859 align:start position:0%
committee's bill now if you needed an
 
03:14:42.530 --> 03:14:42.540 align:start position:0%
amendment you could use that as your
 
03:14:44.030 --> 03:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
launch pad yeah
 
03:14:46.790 --> 03:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
I see okay thank you
 
03:14:48.830 --> 03:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
uh do we have any questions for
 
03:14:51.230 --> 03:14:51.240 align:start position:0%
representative McGee
 
03:14:54.110 --> 03:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
um representative NAB
 
03:14:55.309 --> 03:14:55.319 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
03:14:58.250 --> 03:14:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:59.690 --> 03:14:59.700 align:start position:0%
you know production act funds because I
 
03:15:01.130 --> 03:15:01.140 align:start position:0%
know Arbor funds have sort of a timeline
 
03:15:03.110 --> 03:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
I don't know on the state level I do
 
03:15:06.410 --> 03:15:06.420 align:start position:0%
yeah it was a large uh Bill and
 
03:15:08.090 --> 03:15:08.100 align:start position:0%
commissioner Jasper and I discussed that
 
03:15:11.030 --> 03:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
they they don't run out until they don't
 
03:15:12.889 --> 03:15:12.899 align:start position:0%
they're not intended to stop with
 
03:15:16.370 --> 03:15:16.380 align:start position:0%
funding until 2031. so it's a 10-year
 
03:15:18.230 --> 03:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
investment where people have the
 
03:15:20.030 --> 03:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity to figure out programs and
 
03:15:21.590 --> 03:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
get the money out where it needs to go
 
03:15:21.600 --> 03:15:24.590 align:start position:0%
get the money out where it needs to go
yeah

03:15:24.590 --> 03:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:26.929 --> 03:15:26.939 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you madam
 
03:15:28.550 --> 03:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
chair for taking my question thank you
 
03:15:29.929 --> 03:15:29.939 align:start position:0%
representative so
 
03:15:34.730 --> 03:15:34.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:36.410 --> 03:15:36.420 align:start position:0%
on that no deadline to apply for the
 
03:15:38.990 --> 03:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
reef funding or are you aware because
 
03:15:40.969 --> 03:15:40.979 align:start position:0%
sometimes those windows open and it will
 
03:15:43.130 --> 03:15:43.140 align:start position:0%
say apply by
 
03:15:45.590 --> 03:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
right and I think part of the language
 
03:15:47.929 --> 03:15:47.939 align:start position:0%
in the bill asks that the task force
 
03:15:49.610 --> 03:15:49.620 align:start position:0%
figure out what those deadlines and
 
03:15:52.670 --> 03:15:52.680 align:start position:0%
Milestones are because at this point we
 
03:15:55.010 --> 03:15:55.020 align:start position:0%
don't have a window into which bucket
 
03:15:56.690 --> 03:15:56.700 align:start position:0%
would be coming out of so I don't think
 
03:16:00.110 --> 03:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
we know those details and it's a large
 
03:16:03.230 --> 03:16:03.240 align:start position:0%
it's a large bill you know so there
 
03:16:06.110 --> 03:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
there's a a guideline
 
03:16:08.690 --> 03:16:08.700 align:start position:0%
um document but again there's a lot of
 
03:16:10.730 --> 03:16:10.740 align:start position:0%
details beyond that
 
03:16:13.010 --> 03:16:13.020 align:start position:0%
um I I just thought I could put together
 
03:16:16.429 --> 03:16:16.439 align:start position:0%
some something to say this is what
 
03:16:18.290 --> 03:16:18.300 align:start position:0%
this is what we would like to achieve
 
03:16:20.809 --> 03:16:20.819 align:start position:0%
and let's make sure that we look into it
 
03:16:22.790 --> 03:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
to see that we get whatever monies are
 
03:16:26.170 --> 03:16:26.180 align:start position:0%
coming to us to help our Growers with um
 
03:16:28.190 --> 03:16:28.200 align:start position:0%
transitioning their businesses so that
 
03:16:30.830 --> 03:16:30.840 align:start position:0%
they're more stable
 
03:16:33.830 --> 03:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
representative thank you madam chair and
 
03:16:36.110 --> 03:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question sure
 
03:16:38.030 --> 03:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
um and looking at this task force it's
 
03:16:40.730 --> 03:16:40.740 align:start position:0%
all positives but I would like to
 
03:16:43.550 --> 03:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
there's nowhere nowhere in this task
 
03:16:45.889 --> 03:16:45.899 align:start position:0%
force where it discusses the negative
 
03:16:48.950 --> 03:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
effects of having solar the toxicity of
 
03:16:50.389 --> 03:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
the solar panels and what that will do
 
03:16:52.670 --> 03:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
to the soil and the Farmland surrounding
 
03:16:56.630 --> 03:16:56.640 align:start position:0%
it could you speak to that please sure
 
03:16:59.870 --> 03:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
um I I'm not a solar expert I know
 
03:17:02.090 --> 03:17:02.100 align:start position:0%
um that solar panels won't be leaching
 
03:17:04.670 --> 03:17:04.680 align:start position:0%
into the ground unless they're you know
 
03:17:07.849 --> 03:17:07.859 align:start position:0%
broken or left in a pile somewhere so
 
03:17:10.010 --> 03:17:10.020 align:start position:0%
generally if someone has tracking arrays
 
03:17:12.410 --> 03:17:12.420 align:start position:0%
or array you know solar panels on
 
03:17:15.290 --> 03:17:15.300 align:start position:0%
buildings they're not at any risk for
 
03:17:18.349 --> 03:17:18.359 align:start position:0%
contaminating the environment there is a
 
03:17:18.359 --> 03:17:19.070 align:start position:0%
contaminating the environment there is a
bill

03:17:19.070 --> 03:17:19.080 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:17:20.990 --> 03:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
um that was up for consideration last
 
03:17:23.389 --> 03:17:23.399 align:start position:0%
session and is under consideration again
 
03:17:26.150 --> 03:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
this time around for greater producer
 
03:17:28.309 --> 03:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
responsibility which means that at the
 
03:17:30.590 --> 03:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
point of someone creating
 
03:17:30.600 --> 03:17:31.750 align:start position:0%
point of someone creating
um

03:17:31.750 --> 03:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:17:35.690 --> 03:17:35.700 align:start position:0%
creating a merchandise that has a
 
03:17:37.790 --> 03:17:37.800 align:start position:0%
potential Downstream to be affecting the
 
03:17:40.070 --> 03:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
environment that they would then have to
 
03:17:42.650 --> 03:17:42.660 align:start position:0%
build in either planning around that or
 
03:17:45.290 --> 03:17:45.300 align:start position:0%
costs around what you would be able to
 
03:17:47.210 --> 03:17:47.220 align:start position:0%
do with that at the at the end of the
 
03:17:49.790 --> 03:17:49.800 align:start position:0%
life cycle but um I don't think that's
 
03:17:52.070 --> 03:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
what we're looking to do here in terms
 
03:17:53.150 --> 03:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
of the
 
03:17:56.750 --> 03:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
you know I I think allowing people to
 
03:18:00.050 --> 03:18:00.060 align:start position:0%
augment or offset costs
 
03:18:05.090 --> 03:18:05.100 align:start position:0%
um with locally generated energy is
 
03:18:08.510 --> 03:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
I don't see downsides to that I think
 
03:18:11.269 --> 03:18:11.279 align:start position:0%
there are there are definitely
 
03:18:13.010 --> 03:18:13.020 align:start position:0%
um other considerations that the
 
03:18:14.929 --> 03:18:14.939 align:start position:0%
individual businesses would have to make
 
03:18:14.939 --> 03:18:16.610 align:start position:0%
individual businesses would have to make
but

03:18:16.610 --> 03:18:16.620 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:18:16.620 --> 03:18:17.750 align:start position:0%
but
um

03:18:17.750 --> 03:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:20.389 --> 03:18:20.399 align:start position:0%
but I think the benefits significantly
 
03:18:22.849 --> 03:18:22.859 align:start position:0%
outweigh any down any downside that can
 
03:18:25.429 --> 03:18:25.439 align:start position:0%
be managed a representative company you
 
03:18:27.410 --> 03:18:27.420 align:start position:0%
have a follow-up I do Madam chair thank
 
03:18:27.420 --> 03:18:28.309 align:start position:0%
have a follow-up I do Madam chair thank
you

03:18:28.309 --> 03:18:28.319 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:18:30.349 --> 03:18:30.359 align:start position:0%
um when I look at things regarding
 
03:18:33.590 --> 03:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
Agriculture and farming and just the
 
03:18:36.050 --> 03:18:36.060 align:start position:0%
environment in general I I take a longer
 
03:18:39.050 --> 03:18:39.060 align:start position:0%
approach because our Farmland is soils
 
03:18:40.429 --> 03:18:40.439 align:start position:0%
are depleted we're trying to rebuild
 
03:18:43.910 --> 03:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
them up and at some point these solar
 
03:18:45.769 --> 03:18:45.779 align:start position:0%
panels or solar Farms or whatever they
 
03:18:47.330 --> 03:18:47.340 align:start position:0%
are are going to be dumped into our
 
03:18:49.309 --> 03:18:49.319 align:start position:0%
environment which will have a negative
 
03:18:51.530 --> 03:18:51.540 align:start position:0%
effect on groundwater and the land
 
03:18:54.050 --> 03:18:54.060 align:start position:0%
surrounding them and I think it's
 
03:18:56.750 --> 03:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
important to look at that effect on
 
03:19:00.110 --> 03:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
Farmland itself as part of a task force
 
03:19:01.670 --> 03:19:01.680 align:start position:0%
because we need to look at the negatives
 
03:19:03.830 --> 03:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
not just the positives
 
03:19:06.230 --> 03:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
I would you agree
 
03:19:08.750 --> 03:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the point
 
03:19:08.760 --> 03:19:10.790 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the point
uh

03:19:10.790 --> 03:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:19:12.469 --> 03:19:12.479 align:start position:0%
uh yeah I had a couple of thoughts when
 
03:19:15.710 --> 03:19:15.720 align:start position:0%
you when you started speaking
 
03:19:18.410 --> 03:19:18.420 align:start position:0%
I I go back to my constituent who is a
 
03:19:20.990 --> 03:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
Seventh Generation farmer in Hollis he
 
03:19:24.830 --> 03:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
gave us a specific scenario and he said
 
03:19:28.610 --> 03:19:28.620 align:start position:0%
um we have put all this land at Woodmont
 
03:19:32.510 --> 03:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
into agricultural use we are seeing more
 
03:19:34.670 --> 03:19:34.680 align:start position:0%
droughts and less ability to depend on
 
03:19:37.670 --> 03:19:37.680 align:start position:0%
the rain to keep the crops going so his
 
03:19:39.590 --> 03:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
suggestion was if we could put some
 
03:19:41.269 --> 03:19:41.279 align:start position:0%
solar panels in at the top of a hill
 
03:19:43.730 --> 03:19:43.740 align:start position:0%
over a water body that we could then
 
03:19:46.370 --> 03:19:46.380 align:start position:0%
create a hydro we could you know we
 
03:19:48.290 --> 03:19:48.300 align:start position:0%
could bring the water when we needed it
 
03:19:49.730 --> 03:19:49.740 align:start position:0%
to the lands
 
03:19:52.429 --> 03:19:52.439 align:start position:0%
there are many opportunities that we
 
03:19:55.429 --> 03:19:55.439 align:start position:0%
have that I am not an expert on and none
 
03:19:57.590 --> 03:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
of us likely are experts on what I'm
 
03:20:00.530 --> 03:20:00.540 align:start position:0%
trying to do is open up the opportunity
 
03:20:02.690 --> 03:20:02.700 align:start position:0%
for people who have projects that make
 
03:20:04.969 --> 03:20:04.979 align:start position:0%
sense to be able to
 
03:20:07.429 --> 03:20:07.439 align:start position:0%
you know leverage these federal dollars
 
03:20:09.190 --> 03:20:09.200 align:start position:0%
in order to support
 
03:20:11.630 --> 03:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
converting their operations
 
03:20:18.910 --> 03:20:18.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:22.670 --> 03:20:22.680 align:start position:0%
disposal that does come up a bit I'm on
 
03:20:24.170 --> 03:20:24.180 align:start position:0%
science technology and energy you know
 
03:20:26.809 --> 03:20:26.819 align:start position:0%
we have conversations about that it's a
 
03:20:29.809 --> 03:20:29.819 align:start position:0%
20 to 30 year away problem and that
 
03:20:30.830 --> 03:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean we don't have to think
 
03:20:33.050 --> 03:20:33.060 align:start position:0%
about it but we have more immediate
 
03:20:35.030 --> 03:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
problems that we're trying to solve by
 
03:20:37.550 --> 03:20:37.560 align:start position:0%
these Investments today and that's
 
03:20:40.130 --> 03:20:40.140 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm trying to address so I
 
03:20:42.650 --> 03:20:42.660 align:start position:0%
think that a task force that has once
 
03:20:44.210 --> 03:20:44.220 align:start position:0%
they formulate and they have those
 
03:20:46.429 --> 03:20:46.439 align:start position:0%
concerns I think they would very much be
 
03:20:48.830 --> 03:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
able to address them but
 
03:20:50.690 --> 03:20:50.700 align:start position:0%
um it was beyond the scope of what I was
 
03:20:53.210 --> 03:20:53.220 align:start position:0%
trying to initiate with the bill
 
03:20:55.070 --> 03:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:20:57.050 --> 03:20:57.060 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Bixby you had a
 
03:20:59.510 --> 03:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
question yeah so um I actually have a
 
03:21:00.530 --> 03:21:00.540 align:start position:0%
couple questions but I'm going to start
 
03:21:05.170 --> 03:21:05.180 align:start position:0%
with one uh so would the task force be
 
03:21:08.330 --> 03:21:08.340 align:start position:0%
actively helping farmers get the money
 
03:21:10.490 --> 03:21:10.500 align:start position:0%
or would they be figuring out what we
 
03:21:12.349 --> 03:21:12.359 align:start position:0%
need to do next to help them get the
 
03:21:12.359 --> 03:21:13.790 align:start position:0%
need to do next to help them get the
money

03:21:13.790 --> 03:21:13.800 align:start position:0%
money
 
03:21:15.950 --> 03:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
I think it would be up to the task force
 
03:21:18.110 --> 03:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
how they would most effectively assist
 
03:21:20.929 --> 03:21:20.939 align:start position:0%
Farmers I I wasn't trying to prescribe
 
03:21:23.630 --> 03:21:23.640 align:start position:0%
the solutions I was trying to say
 
03:21:25.429 --> 03:21:25.439 align:start position:0%
there's something we can put together
 
03:21:28.130 --> 03:21:28.140 align:start position:0%
here and I would like to see a task
 
03:21:30.170 --> 03:21:30.180 align:start position:0%
force of people who know more than I do
 
03:21:33.410 --> 03:21:33.420 align:start position:0%
about agriculture figure out what
 
03:21:35.210 --> 03:21:35.220 align:start position:0%
Solutions are appropriate but it's
 
03:21:35.220 --> 03:21:36.230 align:start position:0%
Solutions are appropriate but it's
certainly

03:21:36.230 --> 03:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
03:21:38.690 --> 03:21:38.700 align:start position:0%
the farmers that I know my community is
 
03:21:40.910 --> 03:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
about 40 agricultural I know quite a few
 
03:21:43.490 --> 03:21:43.500 align:start position:0%
farmers and they don't look up from
 
03:21:45.230 --> 03:21:45.240 align:start position:0%
farming you know they're not going to go
 
03:21:47.630 --> 03:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
out and seek things very often
 
03:21:49.370 --> 03:21:49.380 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:21:51.530 --> 03:21:51.540 align:start position:0%
I would hope that if we did come up with
 
03:21:53.150 --> 03:21:53.160 align:start position:0%
a program that there would be some way
 
03:21:55.010 --> 03:21:55.020 align:start position:0%
that the task force would figure out to
 
03:21:56.450 --> 03:21:56.460 align:start position:0%
reach out into the agricultural
 
03:21:58.730 --> 03:21:58.740 align:start position:0%
Community through our our commissioner
 
03:22:00.950 --> 03:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
and through the communicator and other
 
03:22:02.929 --> 03:22:02.939 align:start position:0%
vehicles that we have that farmers do
 
03:22:04.330 --> 03:22:04.340 align:start position:0%
pay attention to
 
03:22:07.670 --> 03:22:07.680 align:start position:0%
Sure representative Bixby yes so
 
03:22:09.590 --> 03:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
um another
 
03:22:09.600 --> 03:22:10.969 align:start position:0%
um another
um

03:22:10.969 --> 03:22:10.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:22:13.429 --> 03:22:13.439 align:start position:0%
thought I had was I'm wondering if this
 
03:22:17.929 --> 03:22:17.939 align:start position:0%
is strictly for solar or if uh there so
 
03:22:22.010 --> 03:22:22.020 align:start position:0%
I know that a lot of a lot of the farms
 
03:22:23.870 --> 03:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
in the state are in areas served by the
 
03:22:25.370 --> 03:22:25.380 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Electric Cooperative and
 
03:22:28.250 --> 03:22:28.260 align:start position:0%
they're starting a uh program which
 
03:22:32.630 --> 03:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
allows uh the customers to that have
 
03:22:36.650 --> 03:22:36.660 align:start position:0%
backup batteries to uh get the best time
 
03:22:40.550 --> 03:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
of time of day time of use so it's um I
 
03:22:43.670 --> 03:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
think it's called transactive Yes Energy
 
03:22:47.990 --> 03:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
um so swarms my heart so
 
03:22:51.230 --> 03:22:51.240 align:start position:0%
um I'm wondering if uh helping farmers
 
03:22:52.969 --> 03:22:52.979 align:start position:0%
get up for doing a setup for doing
 
03:22:55.250 --> 03:22:55.260 align:start position:0%
transactive energy would also be part of
 
03:22:56.929 --> 03:22:56.939 align:start position:0%
this task force or would that have to be
 
03:22:58.730 --> 03:22:58.740 align:start position:0%
something different
 
03:23:02.090 --> 03:23:02.100 align:start position:0%
well it's it's a really good question
 
03:23:04.070 --> 03:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
um it is again beyond the scope maybe a
 
03:23:05.269 --> 03:23:05.279 align:start position:0%
little more ambitious than what I was
 
03:23:07.610 --> 03:23:07.620 align:start position:0%
trying to Define in this bill
 
03:23:09.710 --> 03:23:09.720 align:start position:0%
um the benefit of transactive energy is
 
03:23:12.530 --> 03:23:12.540 align:start position:0%
if we have batteries or vehicles that
 
03:23:15.710 --> 03:23:15.720 align:start position:0%
can go both ways through a smart meter
 
03:23:18.710 --> 03:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
then you can actually put energy back
 
03:23:22.490 --> 03:23:22.500 align:start position:0%
where it's when it's needed so
 
03:23:25.729 --> 03:23:25.739 align:start position:0%
uh that is uh dependent upon our
 
03:23:27.950 --> 03:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
infrastructure so we have a ways to go
 
03:23:29.870 --> 03:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
before that's something that can be done
 
03:23:33.229 --> 03:23:33.239 align:start position:0%
but if there was forethought into the
 
03:23:35.150 --> 03:23:35.160 align:start position:0%
installations that are being placed
 
03:23:36.530 --> 03:23:36.540 align:start position:0%
around the state
 
03:23:39.710 --> 03:23:39.720 align:start position:0%
on rural land then certainly we could we
 
03:23:42.229 --> 03:23:42.239 align:start position:0%
could make those installations be more
 
03:23:44.030 --> 03:23:44.040 align:start position:0%
supportive of our future infrastructure
 
03:23:45.710 --> 03:23:45.720 align:start position:0%
for sure
 
03:23:47.210 --> 03:23:47.220 align:start position:0%
I I
 
03:23:50.570 --> 03:23:50.580 align:start position:0%
um the other representative Bixby so a
 
03:23:52.910 --> 03:23:52.920 align:start position:0%
very small question so I'm much just
 
03:23:54.710 --> 03:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
wondering about the term sunlit is there
 
03:23:56.389 --> 03:23:56.399 align:start position:0%
is that anything specific or is that
 
03:23:58.190 --> 03:23:58.200 align:start position:0%
just I'm just goofy
 
03:24:00.950 --> 03:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
okay I wanted to give it a name so it
 
03:24:03.229 --> 03:24:03.239 align:start position:0%
had uh you know a way to plant in your
 
03:24:05.870 --> 03:24:05.880 align:start position:0%
brain representative Murray
 
03:24:07.849 --> 03:24:07.859 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair for taking my
 
03:24:09.830 --> 03:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
question thank you representative
 
03:24:13.010 --> 03:24:13.020 align:start position:0%
I have uh one question regarding the
 
03:24:15.469 --> 03:24:15.479 align:start position:0%
composition of the task force members
 
03:24:19.729 --> 03:24:19.739 align:start position:0%
looks like there are seven members named
 
03:24:22.490 --> 03:24:22.500 align:start position:0%
uh currently and I was just curious I
 
03:24:24.530 --> 03:24:24.540 align:start position:0%
may have missed it but um would you be
 
03:24:26.870 --> 03:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
open to including Farmers specifically
 
03:24:28.610 --> 03:24:28.620 align:start position:0%
on the task force
 
03:24:30.769 --> 03:24:30.779 align:start position:0%
uh there is a member of the Agricultural
 
03:24:32.630 --> 03:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
Community listed I believe oh I see that
 
03:24:34.790 --> 03:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
I apologize thank you um
 
03:24:37.969 --> 03:24:37.979 align:start position:0%
and yes I had actually two and also two
 
03:24:40.790 --> 03:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
from the solar industry I mean I was
 
03:24:42.650 --> 03:24:42.660 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out who what kind of
 
03:24:44.150 --> 03:24:44.160 align:start position:0%
expertise was needed on the makeup of
 
03:24:45.710 --> 03:24:45.720 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
03:24:47.389 --> 03:24:47.399 align:start position:0%
um but I was cautioned that you know
 
03:24:49.910 --> 03:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
getting committee members to attend and
 
03:24:51.830 --> 03:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
attend on a regular basis is hard so I I
 
03:24:54.410 --> 03:24:54.420 align:start position:0%
lowered the number required and I and I
 
03:24:56.690 --> 03:24:56.700 align:start position:0%
would think like many other
 
03:24:59.450 --> 03:24:59.460 align:start position:0%
um committees or task forces that we put
 
03:25:01.429 --> 03:25:01.439 align:start position:0%
together in the state of New Hampshire
 
03:25:03.349 --> 03:25:03.359 align:start position:0%
if we need additional stakeholders that
 
03:25:05.030 --> 03:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
have special expertise then they would
 
03:25:07.250 --> 03:25:07.260 align:start position:0%
just be asked to join for whatever was
 
03:25:09.650 --> 03:25:09.660 align:start position:0%
needed and follow up if I may yes you
 
03:25:12.050 --> 03:25:12.060 align:start position:0%
may thank you madam chair and then
 
03:25:15.650 --> 03:25:15.660 align:start position:0%
additionally additionally with
 
03:25:18.110 --> 03:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
once the task force would be formed with
 
03:25:19.670 --> 03:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
whatever composition you're you're
 
03:25:22.130 --> 03:25:22.140 align:start position:0%
outlining here would you be open to that
 
03:25:25.429 --> 03:25:25.439 align:start position:0%
being submitted to the
 
03:25:27.410 --> 03:25:27.420 align:start position:0%
Department of markets Agriculture and
 
03:25:28.849 --> 03:25:28.859 align:start position:0%
Foods the findings of that report it
 
03:25:30.530 --> 03:25:30.540 align:start position:0%
looks like it's currently only going to
 
03:25:33.229 --> 03:25:33.239 align:start position:0%
stne and the Senate energy and natural
 
03:25:33.239 --> 03:25:35.330 align:start position:0%
stne and the Senate energy and natural
resources

03:25:35.330 --> 03:25:35.340 align:start position:0%
resources
 
03:25:38.090 --> 03:25:38.100 align:start position:0%
well the chair of the committee was
 
03:25:40.790 --> 03:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
intended to be the chair of the
 
03:25:42.889 --> 03:25:42.899 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of Agriculture and or
 
03:25:45.769 --> 03:25:45.779 align:start position:0%
designee so it would be coming from the
 
03:25:48.170 --> 03:25:48.180 align:start position:0%
agricultural Department as the the
 
03:25:50.269 --> 03:25:50.279 align:start position:0%
department that would be spearheading
 
03:25:54.170 --> 03:25:54.180 align:start position:0%
the research so the reports coming back
 
03:25:56.150 --> 03:25:56.160 align:start position:0%
to the two committees in the House and
 
03:25:59.090 --> 03:25:59.100 align:start position:0%
Senate that have oversight for
 
03:25:59.100 --> 03:26:00.769 align:start position:0%
Senate that have oversight for
the

03:26:00.769 --> 03:26:00.779 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:26:02.870 --> 03:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
um okay the qualities that are in the
 
03:26:04.729 --> 03:26:04.739 align:start position:0%
bill is is just really a way of us
 
03:26:06.410 --> 03:26:06.420 align:start position:0%
understanding where did it land what did
 
03:26:08.510 --> 03:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
you come up with is it going forward is
 
03:26:11.269 --> 03:26:11.279 align:start position:0%
there anything else that's needed so
 
03:26:14.630 --> 03:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
um I I did also include business and
 
03:26:17.389 --> 03:26:17.399 align:start position:0%
economic development I believe
 
03:26:18.769 --> 03:26:18.779 align:start position:0%
um we always try to get someone from
 
03:26:20.450 --> 03:26:20.460 align:start position:0%
business and economic development to be
 
03:26:22.309 --> 03:26:22.319 align:start position:0%
on the stakeholder
 
03:26:25.790 --> 03:26:25.800 align:start position:0%
um group so I did try to
 
03:26:28.490 --> 03:26:28.500 align:start position:0%
figure out who should be on the team but
 
03:26:30.170 --> 03:26:30.180 align:start position:0%
um as I said it doesn't preclude any
 
03:26:32.450 --> 03:26:32.460 align:start position:0%
other people that the commissioner or
 
03:26:33.830 --> 03:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
others think should be involved from
 
03:26:35.450 --> 03:26:35.460 align:start position:0%
being added
 
03:26:38.030 --> 03:26:38.040 align:start position:0%
in an ad hoc way thank you
 
03:26:40.370 --> 03:26:40.380 align:start position:0%
thank you presenting Bixby
 
03:26:43.250 --> 03:26:43.260 align:start position:0%
uh another question about uh the
 
03:26:43.260 --> 03:26:44.929 align:start position:0%
uh another question about uh the
participants

03:26:44.929 --> 03:26:44.939 align:start position:0%
participants
 
03:26:48.530 --> 03:26:48.540 align:start position:0%
um I'm wondering about uh number uh
 
03:26:50.990 --> 03:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
letter e an expert on procurring federal
 
03:26:52.550 --> 03:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
funding from for state agencies
 
03:26:56.030 --> 03:26:56.040 align:start position:0%
appointed by the uh Commissioner of
 
03:26:58.130 --> 03:26:58.140 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture markets of
 
03:26:59.870 --> 03:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
foods and I'm wondering if the
 
03:27:02.450 --> 03:27:02.460 align:start position:0%
department actually has such a person
 
03:27:05.269 --> 03:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
um I have since found out that that
 
03:27:09.590 --> 03:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
there may not exist a person of that ilk
 
03:27:11.269 --> 03:27:11.279 align:start position:0%
um there are people who certainly know
 
03:27:12.590 --> 03:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
more about what's going on with the
 
03:27:13.910 --> 03:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
federal funding than we do which is why
 
03:27:15.950 --> 03:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
I put USDA in there and I had not heard
 
03:27:17.990 --> 03:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
back from them at that time and I was
 
03:27:19.729 --> 03:27:19.739 align:start position:0%
assuming that they would be the correct
 
03:27:22.910 --> 03:27:22.920 align:start position:0%
department and now I'm hearing uh that
 
03:27:25.010 --> 03:27:25.020 align:start position:0%
the tranche of money may not actually be
 
03:27:27.170 --> 03:27:27.180 align:start position:0%
under them but under this other rural
 
03:27:29.389 --> 03:27:29.399 align:start position:0%
program that I gave you the name of the
 
03:27:32.150 --> 03:27:32.160 align:start position:0%
reap program so
 
03:27:34.130 --> 03:27:34.140 align:start position:0%
um there's more investigation to do on
 
03:27:37.010 --> 03:27:37.020 align:start position:0%
it and I uh we do have a New Hampshire
 
03:27:38.830 --> 03:27:38.840 align:start position:0%
USDA office
 
03:27:41.269 --> 03:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
whether they have a resource that they
 
03:27:44.090 --> 03:27:44.100 align:start position:0%
could commit to this I don't know I did
 
03:27:45.950 --> 03:27:45.960 align:start position:0%
have feedback from one other person that
 
03:27:47.510 --> 03:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
I asked to co-sponsor the bill saying
 
03:27:49.910 --> 03:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
well we don't have any control over the
 
03:27:51.710 --> 03:27:51.720 align:start position:0%
U.S folks and they're not you know so we
 
03:27:53.450 --> 03:27:53.460 align:start position:0%
can't make them be part of this
 
03:27:55.790 --> 03:27:55.800 align:start position:0%
committee but what I was thinking was
 
03:27:58.190 --> 03:27:58.200 align:start position:0%
that what might be missing on the
 
03:27:59.450 --> 03:27:59.460 align:start position:0%
committee is someone who actually
 
03:28:01.969 --> 03:28:01.979 align:start position:0%
understood how to interact with the
 
03:28:03.650 --> 03:28:03.660 align:start position:0%
the federal pieces of the law to figure
 
03:28:05.389 --> 03:28:05.399 align:start position:0%
it out so that's why I wanted to try and
 
03:28:08.150 --> 03:28:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:08.160 --> 03:28:09.490 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:28:09.490 --> 03:28:09.500 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:28:12.349 --> 03:28:12.359 align:start position:0%
representative Creighton
 
03:28:14.990 --> 03:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and and
 
03:28:18.290 --> 03:28:18.300 align:start position:0%
your really thinking about how to take
 
03:28:21.010 --> 03:28:21.020 align:start position:0%
advantage of these opportunities
 
03:28:23.330 --> 03:28:23.340 align:start position:0%
going back to paragraph 200 the
 
03:28:23.340 --> 03:28:24.889 align:start position:0%
going back to paragraph 200 the
membership

03:28:24.889 --> 03:28:24.899 align:start position:0%
membership
 
03:28:27.710 --> 03:28:27.720 align:start position:0%
um I noticed you I don't see a member of
 
03:28:31.309 --> 03:28:31.319 align:start position:0%
the house or Senate on there is that uh
 
03:28:33.650 --> 03:28:33.660 align:start position:0%
was the reasoning behind that there
 
03:28:36.170 --> 03:28:36.180 align:start position:0%
isn't any I I honestly didn't even think
 
03:28:37.910 --> 03:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
of it
 
03:28:39.410 --> 03:28:39.420 align:start position:0%
um and I know that when we have
 
03:28:41.090 --> 03:28:41.100 align:start position:0%
commissions we generally have membership
 
03:28:43.790 --> 03:28:43.800 align:start position:0%
from both both sides of the house we
 
03:28:46.610 --> 03:28:46.620 align:start position:0%
dictate that and I would be amenable to
 
03:28:48.650 --> 03:28:48.660 align:start position:0%
you adding that um the makeup of the
 
03:28:51.050 --> 03:28:51.060 align:start position:0%
committee I was just trying to get to
 
03:28:53.269 --> 03:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
the point where I had a starter bill
 
03:28:56.690 --> 03:28:56.700 align:start position:0%
that had what to me made sense but I I'm
 
03:28:59.210 --> 03:28:59.220 align:start position:0%
not an expert so I would defer to you if
 
03:29:00.290 --> 03:29:00.300 align:start position:0%
you think that somebody else should be
 
03:29:01.790 --> 03:29:01.800 align:start position:0%
added that would be great thank you
 
03:29:01.800 --> 03:29:03.229 align:start position:0%
added that would be great thank you
ma'am

03:29:03.229 --> 03:29:03.239 align:start position:0%
ma'am
 
03:29:05.530 --> 03:29:05.540 align:start position:0%
any other questions for
 
03:29:07.250 --> 03:29:07.260 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby thank you because
 
03:29:09.769 --> 03:29:09.779 align:start position:0%
it's a small question also so
 
03:29:11.450 --> 03:29:11.460 align:start position:0%
um this bill will obviously need some
 
03:29:14.870 --> 03:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
amending and uh I'm wondering
 
03:29:14.880 --> 03:29:16.610 align:start position:0%
amending and uh I'm wondering
um

03:29:16.610 --> 03:29:16.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:29:19.190 --> 03:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
uh I'm just thinking about the timeline
 
03:29:21.229 --> 03:29:21.239 align:start position:0%
for that we have do you know if this is
 
03:29:23.929 --> 03:29:23.939 align:start position:0%
an early bill or a regular Bill and uh
 
03:29:26.269 --> 03:29:26.279 align:start position:0%
would you be will if we set a
 
03:29:28.010 --> 03:29:28.020 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on working on this would be
 
03:29:30.170 --> 03:29:30.180 align:start position:0%
you would be willing to help out getting
 
03:29:32.210 --> 03:29:32.220 align:start position:0%
us the information we need
 
03:29:34.190 --> 03:29:34.200 align:start position:0%
I think a subcommittee is a great idea
 
03:29:37.010 --> 03:29:37.020 align:start position:0%
and early Bill late bill it's not nearly
 
03:29:38.269 --> 03:29:38.279 align:start position:0%
bill it doesn't have an FN or anything
 
03:29:39.469 --> 03:29:39.479 align:start position:0%
it's not going to a second committee
 
03:29:41.690 --> 03:29:41.700 align:start position:0%
that I'm aware of okay thank you you're
 
03:29:41.700 --> 03:29:43.610 align:start position:0%
that I'm aware of okay thank you you're
welcome

03:29:43.610 --> 03:29:43.620 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
03:29:46.070 --> 03:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
anyone else with a question I I have a
 
03:29:49.729 --> 03:29:49.739 align:start position:0%
question too I did get an email from
 
03:29:53.450 --> 03:29:53.460 align:start position:0%
uh Carol Foss
 
03:29:56.690 --> 03:29:56.700 align:start position:0%
uh who is asking if it would be amenable
 
03:29:59.389 --> 03:29:59.399 align:start position:0%
to have a representative
 
03:30:01.729 --> 03:30:01.739 align:start position:0%
of the natural resources conservation
 
03:30:04.610 --> 03:30:04.620 align:start position:0%
service be added to this list of people
 
03:30:07.670 --> 03:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
that makes a lot of sense okay
 
03:30:10.070 --> 03:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you any other questions
 
03:30:12.050 --> 03:30:12.060 align:start position:0%

neutral on House Bill 369 but just
 
03:30:57.769 --> 03:30:57.779 align:start position:0%

opportunity to speak with representative

McGee about this bill when it was in the
 
03:31:06.290 --> 03:31:06.300 align:start position:0%
LSR drafting stage just to understand

03:31:11.750 --> 03:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
the Genesis of it the
 
03:31:14.690 --> 03:31:14.700 align:start position:0%
to back up a little bit in my role at
 
03:31:15.950 --> 03:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Department of energy
 
03:31:18.130 --> 03:31:18.140 align:start position:0%
I'm responsible for
 
03:31:20.269 --> 03:31:20.279 align:start position:0%
monitoring various Federal funding
 
03:31:22.150 --> 03:31:22.160 align:start position:0%
opportunities coming down through the
 
03:31:24.469 --> 03:31:24.479 align:start position:0%
infrastructure investment and jobs act
 
03:31:27.530 --> 03:31:27.540 align:start position:0%
which passed a couple years back as I
 
03:31:28.969 --> 03:31:28.979 align:start position:0%
shouldn't say a couple years back
 
03:31:30.530 --> 03:31:30.540 align:start position:0%
um but and then also the inflation
 
03:31:32.450 --> 03:31:32.460 align:start position:0%
reduction act which was signed into law
 
03:31:34.790 --> 03:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
in August of last year
 
03:31:34.800 --> 03:31:36.290 align:start position:0%
in August of last year
um

03:31:36.290 --> 03:31:36.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:31:39.889 --> 03:31:39.899 align:start position:0%
regarding this bill is it focuses on
 
03:31:41.570 --> 03:31:41.580 align:start position:0%
federal funding coming out of the
 
03:31:44.570 --> 03:31:44.580 align:start position:0%
inflation reduction act based on at
 
03:31:46.429 --> 03:31:46.439 align:start position:0%
least my review of various funding
 
03:31:47.510 --> 03:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
opportunities coming down through that
 
03:31:50.510 --> 03:31:50.520 align:start position:0%
bill there is no agriculturally focused
 
03:31:52.370 --> 03:31:52.380 align:start position:0%
funding Federal funding opportunity that
 
03:31:54.530 --> 03:31:54.540 align:start position:0%
states would then apply to and then
 
03:31:58.929 --> 03:31:58.939 align:start position:0%
sub-grant out to eligible uh recipients
 
03:32:02.510 --> 03:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
a lot as representative McGee mentioned
 
03:32:04.010 --> 03:32:04.020 align:start position:0%
a lot of that money is going into
 
03:32:07.010 --> 03:32:07.020 align:start position:0%
existing uh agricultural based programs
 
03:32:08.809 --> 03:32:08.819 align:start position:0%
so for example two billion dollars more
 
03:32:11.510 --> 03:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
into the rural energy for America
 
03:32:14.510 --> 03:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
program and that program runs regularly
 
03:32:16.309 --> 03:32:16.319 align:start position:0%
through the U.S department of
 
03:32:18.650 --> 03:32:18.660 align:start position:0%
Agriculture offering a combination of
 
03:32:21.110 --> 03:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
loans and grants to rural small
 
03:32:23.690 --> 03:32:23.700 align:start position:0%
businesses agricultural producers for
 
03:32:26.090 --> 03:32:26.100 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency improvements renewable
 
03:32:29.150 --> 03:32:29.160 align:start position:0%
energy those types of projects
 
03:32:29.160 --> 03:32:29.870 align:start position:0%
energy those types of projects
um

03:32:29.870 --> 03:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:32.090 --> 03:32:32.100 align:start position:0%
so I just at least wanted to highlight
 
03:32:34.010 --> 03:32:34.020 align:start position:0%
that and that if this bill is to go
 
03:32:35.570 --> 03:32:35.580 align:start position:0%
forward a big question mark at least in
 
03:32:38.090 --> 03:32:38.100 align:start position:0%
my eyes would be what federal funding
 
03:32:40.190 --> 03:32:40.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity would we be
 
03:32:43.130 --> 03:32:43.140 align:start position:0%
targeting I guess with this task force
 
03:32:45.170 --> 03:32:45.180 align:start position:0%
um moving on down at least until the
 
03:32:47.809 --> 03:32:47.819 align:start position:0%
other stuff is um establish a criteria
 
03:32:50.990 --> 03:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
an application process line 26.
 
03:32:51.000 --> 03:32:51.590 align:start position:0%
an application process line 26.
um

03:32:51.590 --> 03:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:53.510 --> 03:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
based on at least the prime sponsors
 
03:32:55.429 --> 03:32:55.439 align:start position:0%
indication is that the bill would
 
03:32:57.950 --> 03:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
actively promote funding opportunities
 
03:32:57.960 --> 03:32:59.990 align:start position:0%
actively promote funding opportunities
to

03:32:59.990 --> 03:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:33:01.849 --> 03:33:01.859 align:start position:0%
um to agricultural interests and
 
03:33:05.330 --> 03:33:05.340 align:start position:0%
producers this language here at least in
 
03:33:07.070 --> 03:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
the Department's view in
 
03:33:09.410 --> 03:33:09.420 align:start position:0%
um online 26 on page one kind of
 
03:33:11.330 --> 03:33:11.340 align:start position:0%
indicates that the task force might be
 
03:33:13.670 --> 03:33:13.680 align:start position:0%
creating uh its own program Criterion
 
03:33:16.309 --> 03:33:16.319 align:start position:0%
application process I would just caution
 
03:33:18.290 --> 03:33:18.300 align:start position:0%
against that just because with federal
 
03:33:20.929 --> 03:33:20.939 align:start position:0%
dollars comes Federal strengths there
 
03:33:22.490 --> 03:33:22.500 align:start position:0%
are process there are processes
 
03:33:24.710 --> 03:33:24.720 align:start position:0%
expectations regulations compliance
 
03:33:27.229 --> 03:33:27.239 align:start position:0%
standards that follow federal dollars if
 
03:33:29.170 --> 03:33:29.180 align:start position:0%
the state were to go another way and
 
03:33:31.790 --> 03:33:31.800 align:start position:0%
outline its own application process over
 
03:33:33.950 --> 03:33:33.960 align:start position:0%
a federal process
 
03:33:35.510 --> 03:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
you'd get you I think you could
 
03:33:36.650 --> 03:33:36.660 align:start position:0%
understand that there might be a
 
03:33:38.870 --> 03:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
compliance mix up there
 
03:33:41.450 --> 03:33:41.460 align:start position:0%
um in terms of little c
 
03:33:43.550 --> 03:33:43.560 align:start position:0%
um and using federal funds to provide
 
03:33:46.309 --> 03:33:46.319 align:start position:0%
tax credits if there were a federal
 
03:33:48.170 --> 03:33:48.180 align:start position:0%
funding opportunity to Avail ourselves
 
03:33:51.530 --> 03:33:51.540 align:start position:0%
of again uh as I mentioned before you'd
 
03:33:52.610 --> 03:33:52.620 align:start position:0%
want to know a little bit more about
 
03:33:54.830 --> 03:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
what the federal strings are for that is
 
03:33:56.870 --> 03:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
when if the state were to apply for
 
03:34:00.110 --> 03:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
federal funds if they did exist and we
 
03:34:02.090 --> 03:34:02.100 align:start position:0%
could use them are we able to then
 
03:34:04.130 --> 03:34:04.140 align:start position:0%
create some type of tax credit system
 
03:34:07.309 --> 03:34:07.319 align:start position:0%
with those dollars if you can't you
 
03:34:10.309 --> 03:34:10.319 align:start position:0%
can't again it's it's it is a big
 
03:34:12.469 --> 03:34:12.479 align:start position:0%
question mark there I know that there
 
03:34:15.830 --> 03:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
are a number of tax incentives under the
 
03:34:18.349 --> 03:34:18.359 align:start position:0%
IRA federal tax incentives uh the
 
03:34:19.610 --> 03:34:19.620 align:start position:0%
department of energy is certainly not
 
03:34:22.250 --> 03:34:22.260 align:start position:0%
any type of tax professional if Farmers
 
03:34:24.050 --> 03:34:24.060 align:start position:0%
or agricultural producers are interested
 
03:34:25.969 --> 03:34:25.979 align:start position:0%
in a tax credits they should certainly
 
03:34:28.370 --> 03:34:28.380 align:start position:0%
talk with any tax consultant or tax
 
03:34:31.250 --> 03:34:31.260 align:start position:0%
professional for sure and then finally
 
03:34:35.330 --> 03:34:35.340 align:start position:0%
on page two uh uh paragraph D about
 
03:34:37.729 --> 03:34:37.739 align:start position:0%
making a recommendation about an
 
03:34:40.010 --> 03:34:40.020 align:start position:0%
agricultural net metering credit I just
 
03:34:42.229 --> 03:34:42.239 align:start position:0%
wanted to mention that this uh that net
 
03:34:44.030 --> 03:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
metering obviously as legislators might
 
03:34:46.070 --> 03:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
know is a recurring issue
 
03:34:47.809 --> 03:34:47.819 align:start position:0%
um every year and pending legislation
 
03:34:50.750 --> 03:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
there is an ongoing docket currently at
 
03:34:52.429 --> 03:34:52.439 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission to
 
03:34:54.469 --> 03:34:54.479 align:start position:0%
determine uh potential changes to the
 
03:34:56.510 --> 03:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
net metering tariff
 
03:34:58.610 --> 03:34:58.620 align:start position:0%
um and then finally
 
03:34:59.750 --> 03:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
um the only other thing I would just
 
03:35:02.150 --> 03:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
note is that the inflation reduction Act
 
03:35:04.849 --> 03:35:04.859 align:start position:0%
was signed in into law in August of last
 
03:35:04.859 --> 03:35:05.690 align:start position:0%
was signed in into law in August of last
year

03:35:05.690 --> 03:35:05.700 align:start position:0%
year
 
03:35:07.969 --> 03:35:07.979 align:start position:0%
Federal guidance for various funding out
 
03:35:11.090 --> 03:35:11.100 align:start position:0%
of that bill is slow and continuing to
 
03:35:14.750 --> 03:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
evolve so if there were a federal
 
03:35:16.490 --> 03:35:16.500 align:start position:0%
funding opportunity again we'd like to
 
03:35:17.870 --> 03:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
know a little bit more in terms of the
 
03:35:20.210 --> 03:35:20.220 align:start position:0%
details as to what comes with that those
 
03:35:22.130 --> 03:35:22.140 align:start position:0%
dollars the other resource I would
 
03:35:23.990 --> 03:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
direct the committee to is that the
 
03:35:26.570 --> 03:35:26.580 align:start position:0%
White House put out as it did with the
 
03:35:29.450 --> 03:35:29.460 align:start position:0%
infrastructure Bill an IRA guide book
 
03:35:32.389 --> 03:35:32.399 align:start position:0%
and basically that book for about 100
 
03:35:35.090 --> 03:35:35.100 align:start position:0%
150 Pages outlines all the various tax
 
03:35:37.670 --> 03:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
credits tax incentives Federal funding
 
03:35:39.950 --> 03:35:39.960 align:start position:0%
programs coming down through the uh
 
03:35:41.870 --> 03:35:41.880 align:start position:0%
inflation reduction act I can certainly
 
03:35:43.969 --> 03:35:43.979 align:start position:0%
share that with the committee but each
 
03:35:46.130 --> 03:35:46.140 align:start position:0%
page kind of outlines just a one page of
 
03:35:48.530 --> 03:35:48.540 align:start position:0%
what the different programs are and just
 
03:35:49.849 --> 03:35:49.859 align:start position:0%
by looking through a lot of the
 
03:35:51.530 --> 03:35:51.540 align:start position:0%
Agricultural related ones a lot of the
 
03:35:53.510 --> 03:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
eligible eligibility for those programs
 
03:35:56.330 --> 03:35:56.340 align:start position:0%
is just open to agricultural producers
 
03:35:58.910 --> 03:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
themselves again to reiterate as I said
 
03:36:00.349 --> 03:36:00.359 align:start position:0%
it's not necessarily something where you
 
03:36:02.570 --> 03:36:02.580 align:start position:0%
put the state in the position to apply
 
03:36:04.070 --> 03:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
and then sub Grant out these dollars
 
03:36:05.150 --> 03:36:05.160 align:start position:0%
it's largely between the federal
 
03:36:06.710 --> 03:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
government and the agricultural
 
03:36:09.830 --> 03:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
producers themselves and with that more
 
03:36:11.090 --> 03:36:11.100 align:start position:0%
than happy to take any questions I
 
03:36:13.910 --> 03:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
apologize for going on
 
03:36:16.670 --> 03:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Murray
 
03:36:19.370 --> 03:36:19.380 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I know with other
 
03:36:21.769 --> 03:36:21.779 align:start position:0%
grant opportunities sometimes the U.S
 
03:36:23.870 --> 03:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
Department of Treasury offers guidance
 
03:36:26.269 --> 03:36:26.279 align:start position:0%
and I was curious to know whether or not
 
03:36:28.370 --> 03:36:28.380 align:start position:0%
that is the case with some of the things
 
03:36:30.650 --> 03:36:30.660 align:start position:0%
that you're currently mentioning sure so
 
03:36:32.570 --> 03:36:32.580 align:start position:0%
in term thank you for the question
 
03:36:35.150 --> 03:36:35.160 align:start position:0%
um in terms of the agriculture related
 
03:36:37.309 --> 03:36:37.319 align:start position:0%
incentives it depends on the on the
 
03:36:39.469 --> 03:36:39.479 align:start position:0%
federal agency that rolls through so for
 
03:36:41.570 --> 03:36:41.580 align:start position:0%
example a lot of the you know energy
 
03:36:43.070 --> 03:36:43.080 align:start position:0%
related stuff dealing with Energy
 
03:36:44.630 --> 03:36:44.640 align:start position:0%
Efficiency renewable energy might throw
 
03:36:46.070 --> 03:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
roll through the U.S department of
 
03:36:48.229 --> 03:36:48.239 align:start position:0%
energy a lot of these agricultural
 
03:36:50.150 --> 03:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
things might roll through say the U.S
 
03:36:51.830 --> 03:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
department of interior or the U.S
 
03:36:53.630 --> 03:36:53.640 align:start position:0%
department of Agriculture so it kind of
 
03:36:55.849 --> 03:36:55.859 align:start position:0%
depends as to which federal agency gets
 
03:36:58.070 --> 03:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
the jurisdiction thank you okay
 
03:37:00.469 --> 03:37:00.479 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby
 
03:37:02.870 --> 03:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my question
 
03:37:06.469 --> 03:37:06.479 align:start position:0%
um so you you mentioned that many of the
 
03:37:09.110 --> 03:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
subsidies seem that available for
 
03:37:11.150 --> 03:37:11.160 align:start position:0%
agriculture seem to be direct from the
 
03:37:13.570 --> 03:37:13.580 align:start position:0%
feds to the farmers and I'm wondering
 
03:37:16.670 --> 03:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
how a small New Hampshire farmer figures
 
03:37:19.790 --> 03:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
out how to negotiate that process when
 
03:37:24.290 --> 03:37:24.300 align:start position:0%
they are spending from like 5 a.m to
 
03:37:26.929 --> 03:37:26.939 align:start position:0%
8 P.M in the fields I I get that thank
 
03:37:28.910 --> 03:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
you for the question representative
 
03:37:28.920 --> 03:37:29.870 align:start position:0%
you for the question representative
um

03:37:29.870 --> 03:37:29.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:32.330 --> 03:37:32.340 align:start position:0%
I I I guess my comments just to focus
 
03:37:33.769 --> 03:37:33.779 align:start position:0%
were just on the bill is introduced I
 
03:37:35.269 --> 03:37:35.279 align:start position:0%
haven't seen a potential language
 
03:37:36.889 --> 03:37:36.899 align:start position:0%
changes that I think the prime sponsor
 
03:37:39.769 --> 03:37:39.779 align:start position:0%
shared a few moments earlier
 
03:37:41.389 --> 03:37:41.399 align:start position:0%
um but obviously you know the U.S
 
03:37:43.370 --> 03:37:43.380 align:start position:0%
department of Agriculture does have a
 
03:37:45.050 --> 03:37:45.060 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire State office they
 
03:37:48.110 --> 03:37:48.120 align:start position:0%
regularly try to work and uh they
 
03:37:50.269 --> 03:37:50.279 align:start position:0%
regularly work with agricultural
 
03:37:52.070 --> 03:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
producers interested stakeholders kind
 
03:37:54.290 --> 03:37:54.300 align:start position:0%
of advertise these opportunities a lot
 
03:37:56.510 --> 03:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
of information on the run on the rural
 
03:37:59.330 --> 03:37:59.340 align:start position:0%
energy for America or reap program is
 
03:38:01.490 --> 03:38:01.500 align:start position:0%
available online get an idea of what the
 
03:38:02.870 --> 03:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
eligibility standards are and everything
 
03:38:06.110 --> 03:38:06.120 align:start position:0%
like that personally though I do
 
03:38:08.750 --> 03:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
understand that Federal compliances can
 
03:38:10.070 --> 03:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
certainly be a bit of a headache if
 
03:38:12.050 --> 03:38:12.060 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with Davis bacon buy
 
03:38:14.809 --> 03:38:14.819 align:start position:0%
America requirements NEPA requirements
 
03:38:16.849 --> 03:38:16.859 align:start position:0%
um that is that is burdensome but the
 
03:38:18.650 --> 03:38:18.660 align:start position:0%
U.S department of Agriculture I believe
 
03:38:20.929 --> 03:38:20.939 align:start position:0%
does have resources to try to help
 
03:38:24.590 --> 03:38:24.600 align:start position:0%
farmers understand that
 
03:38:26.389 --> 03:38:26.399 align:start position:0%
and certainly the reap program has been
 
03:38:28.550 --> 03:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
something that's been ongoing
 
03:38:30.769 --> 03:38:30.779 align:start position:0%
um and has obviously had success here in
 
03:38:34.910 --> 03:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:37.370 --> 03:38:37.380 align:start position:0%
thank you and I have a question do you
 
03:38:40.610 --> 03:38:40.620 align:start position:0%
believe that it makes any sense to tie
 
03:38:42.650 --> 03:38:42.660 align:start position:0%
this type of
 
03:38:45.790 --> 03:38:45.800 align:start position:0%
uh commission or task force or program
 
03:38:48.830 --> 03:38:48.840 align:start position:0%
to any one piece of federal legislation
 
03:38:51.469 --> 03:38:51.479 align:start position:0%
like the inflation reduction act I mean
 
03:38:53.809 --> 03:38:53.819 align:start position:0%
as you were saying that there are so
 
03:38:56.809 --> 03:38:56.819 align:start position:0%
many different programs available
 
03:38:59.870 --> 03:38:59.880 align:start position:0%
maybe we need you know the task force
 
03:39:03.250 --> 03:39:03.260 align:start position:0%
just to be sort of the
 
03:39:08.090 --> 03:39:08.100 align:start position:0%
data point of of many different programs
 
03:39:10.490 --> 03:39:10.500 align:start position:0%
that are available for our farmers and
 
03:39:11.990 --> 03:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
rural community nope and that's
 
03:39:13.250 --> 03:39:13.260 align:start position:0%
understand and thank you for the
 
03:39:13.260 --> 03:39:14.090 align:start position:0%
understand and thank you for the
question

03:39:14.090 --> 03:39:14.100 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:39:16.130 --> 03:39:16.140 align:start position:0%
um at least in my role at the department
 
03:39:18.889 --> 03:39:18.899 align:start position:0%
is I'm only speaking to U.S department
 
03:39:21.710 --> 03:39:21.720 align:start position:0%
of energy related funding programs is uh
 
03:39:23.750 --> 03:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
we've tried to go through the
 
03:39:25.190 --> 03:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
infrastructure bill and the IRA and
 
03:39:27.110 --> 03:39:27.120 align:start position:0%
create web pages on our website to kind
 
03:39:29.510 --> 03:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
of advertise certain select funding
 
03:39:29.520 --> 03:39:30.710 align:start position:0%
of advertise certain select funding
opportunities

03:39:30.710 --> 03:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
opportunities
 
03:39:32.210 --> 03:39:32.220 align:start position:0%
respectfully the department does not
 
03:39:34.010 --> 03:39:34.020 align:start position:0%
have the bandwidth to advertise every
 
03:39:35.630 --> 03:39:35.640 align:start position:0%
single one and not every single one
 
03:39:37.790 --> 03:39:37.800 align:start position:0%
might not be at may not be applicable to
 
03:39:40.010 --> 03:39:40.020 align:start position:0%
constituencies in New Hampshire uh but
 
03:39:42.349 --> 03:39:42.359 align:start position:0%
that's at least what you know uh the the
 
03:39:43.729 --> 03:39:43.739 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of energy is
 
03:39:45.590 --> 03:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
doing on U.S department of energy
 
03:39:47.809 --> 03:39:47.819 align:start position:0%
related funding initiatives
 
03:39:49.729 --> 03:39:49.739 align:start position:0%
um whether or not a state task force
 
03:39:51.650 --> 03:39:51.660 align:start position:0%
might help better bridge that Gap to
 
03:39:53.690 --> 03:39:53.700 align:start position:0%
advertise these opportunities you know
 
03:39:55.610 --> 03:39:55.620 align:start position:0%
that's worthy of consideration it's just
 
03:39:57.229 --> 03:39:57.239 align:start position:0%
I think the main point I wanted to make
 
03:39:59.750 --> 03:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
in our in the bill today was when it
 
03:40:02.389 --> 03:40:02.399 align:start position:0%
mentions funding from the IRA it's at in
 
03:40:04.790 --> 03:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
our first glance we're unclear as to
 
03:40:06.650 --> 03:40:06.660 align:start position:0%
what specific funding opportunities the
 
03:40:08.630 --> 03:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
task force would be
 
03:40:11.570 --> 03:40:11.580 align:start position:0%
looking at and potentially advertising
 
03:40:15.110 --> 03:40:15.120 align:start position:0%
out okay thank you very much for that
 
03:40:16.610 --> 03:40:16.620 align:start position:0%
um any other questions from the
 
03:40:16.620 --> 03:40:18.469 align:start position:0%
um any other questions from the
committee

03:40:18.469 --> 03:40:18.479 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:40:20.630 --> 03:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
no seeing none
 
03:40:22.550 --> 03:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
I thank you for your taking money today
 
03:40:24.950 --> 03:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
and I call uh commissioner Jasper to
 
03:40:32.990 --> 03:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:34.849 --> 03:40:34.859 align:start position:0%
welcome back
 
03:40:39.830 --> 03:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:42.050 --> 03:40:42.060 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the opportunity to test
 
03:40:44.750 --> 03:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
uh testify did have a very good
 
03:40:47.030 --> 03:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
conversation uh last week with the
 
03:40:50.150 --> 03:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
sponsor and I applaud her efforts on
 
03:40:53.330 --> 03:40:53.340 align:start position:0%
behalf of New Hampshire uh farmers and I
 
03:40:53.340 --> 03:40:54.950 align:start position:0%
behalf of New Hampshire uh farmers and I
appreciate

03:40:54.950 --> 03:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
03:40:57.769 --> 03:40:57.779 align:start position:0%
her uh attempt to be Innovative I do
 
03:41:00.110 --> 03:41:00.120 align:start position:0%
have concerns
 
03:41:00.120 --> 03:41:00.650 align:start position:0%
have concerns
um

03:41:00.650 --> 03:41:00.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:02.570 --> 03:41:02.580 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate the testimony of the
 
03:41:05.210 --> 03:41:05.220 align:start position:0%
Department of energy because
 
03:41:08.690 --> 03:41:08.700 align:start position:0%
um the conclusions they have come to are
 
03:41:11.290 --> 03:41:11.300 align:start position:0%
the same that I have come to I did spend
 
03:41:13.929 --> 03:41:13.939 align:start position:0%
considerable amount of time
 
03:41:16.370 --> 03:41:16.380 align:start position:0%
going through the bill
 
03:41:19.790 --> 03:41:19.800 align:start position:0%
so 295 page Bill and there's
 
03:41:21.710 --> 03:41:21.720 align:start position:0%
specifically somewhere in the vicinity
 
03:41:26.389 --> 03:41:26.399 align:start position:0%
of 25 30 pages that um
 
03:41:29.030 --> 03:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
do relate to Farms but throughout the
 
03:41:29.040 --> 03:41:29.870 align:start position:0%
do relate to Farms but throughout the
bill

03:41:29.870 --> 03:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:41:34.130 --> 03:41:34.140 align:start position:0%
it primarily about tax credits loans
 
03:41:35.769 --> 03:41:35.779 align:start position:0%
that are partially
 
03:41:39.110 --> 03:41:39.120 align:start position:0%
forgivable and um
 
03:41:43.250 --> 03:41:43.260 align:start position:0%
in Grants to energy producers
 
03:41:43.260 --> 03:41:43.910 align:start position:0%
in Grants to energy producers
um

03:41:43.910 --> 03:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:47.389 --> 03:41:47.399 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that it with our the scale
 
03:41:48.590 --> 03:41:48.600 align:start position:0%
of things when you look at the United
 
03:41:48.600 --> 03:41:50.170 align:start position:0%
of things when you look at the United
States

03:41:50.170 --> 03:41:50.180 align:start position:0%
States
 
03:41:53.750 --> 03:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
that there's much opportunity for New
 
03:41:56.290 --> 03:41:56.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Farms to be seen as energy
 
03:41:59.030 --> 03:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
producers when there is a limited amount
 
03:42:00.889 --> 03:42:00.899 align:start position:0%
of money here that doesn't mean we
 
03:42:02.929 --> 03:42:02.939 align:start position:0%
shouldn't look at it
 
03:42:06.410 --> 03:42:06.420 align:start position:0%
but my main concern is really
 
03:42:08.690 --> 03:42:08.700 align:start position:0%
that this is something that is way out
 
03:42:11.150 --> 03:42:11.160 align:start position:0%
of the Wheelhouse of the traditional
 
03:42:12.650 --> 03:42:12.660 align:start position:0%
function of the New Hampshire Department
 
03:42:15.229 --> 03:42:15.239 align:start position:0%
of Agriculture as you learned last week
 
03:42:19.610 --> 03:42:19.620 align:start position:0%
we're already up to our eyeballs
 
03:42:19.620 --> 03:42:20.349 align:start position:0%
we're already up to our eyeballs
um

03:42:20.349 --> 03:42:20.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:23.510 --> 03:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
I really as much as I applaud the
 
03:42:26.750 --> 03:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
efforts here I don't see how I have the
 
03:42:28.910 --> 03:42:28.920 align:start position:0%
time to Be an Effective leader of this
 
03:42:31.670 --> 03:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
this group because I do have
 
03:42:35.870 --> 03:42:35.880 align:start position:0%
um many many legislative uh response
 
03:42:37.790 --> 03:42:37.800 align:start position:0%
responsibilities that the legislature
 
03:42:40.610 --> 03:42:40.620 align:start position:0%
has put upon us our traditional role
 
03:42:42.469 --> 03:42:42.479 align:start position:0%
when it comes to these type of federal
 
03:42:46.130 --> 03:42:46.140 align:start position:0%
programs is managing grants
 
03:42:48.229 --> 03:42:48.239 align:start position:0%
that grants come to us in blocks and
 
03:42:51.170 --> 03:42:51.180 align:start position:0%
then we put those out I'm very hesitant
 
03:42:53.929 --> 03:42:53.939 align:start position:0%
to say that I would be amenable to
 
03:42:56.170 --> 03:42:56.180 align:start position:0%
saying that we would now be an agency
 
03:42:59.870 --> 03:42:59.880 align:start position:0%
that goes out there and looks for grants
 
03:43:02.570 --> 03:43:02.580 align:start position:0%
that farmers could apply for on their
 
03:43:05.210 --> 03:43:05.220 align:start position:0%
own and now we would direct direct that
 
03:43:07.550 --> 03:43:07.560 align:start position:0%
to them that's more an education process
 
03:43:09.830 --> 03:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
my thought is because this is a
 
03:43:11.870 --> 03:43:11.880 align:start position:0%
nationwide process this is something
 
03:43:14.809 --> 03:43:14.819 align:start position:0%
that American Farm Bureau should be
 
03:43:16.849 --> 03:43:16.859 align:start position:0%
doing if there is an opportunity here
 
03:43:18.530 --> 03:43:18.540 align:start position:0%
this is something that the Farm Bureau
 
03:43:21.050 --> 03:43:21.060 align:start position:0%
should be putting together teaching
 
03:43:23.510 --> 03:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
people how to do this maybe on a
 
03:43:26.450 --> 03:43:26.460 align:start position:0%
national level uh Cooperative Extension
 
03:43:28.370 --> 03:43:28.380 align:start position:0%
but I'm not sure this is something they
 
03:43:30.170 --> 03:43:30.180 align:start position:0%
would normally get into
 
03:43:34.670 --> 03:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
either but yeah the the bottom line is
 
03:43:37.309 --> 03:43:37.319 align:start position:0%
um that I don't I don't see that I have
 
03:43:40.550 --> 03:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
any of the expertise within my office
 
03:43:44.030 --> 03:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
to be helpful on this that putting the
 
03:43:45.710 --> 03:43:45.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner in charge of this is
 
03:43:48.410 --> 03:43:48.420 align:start position:0%
something that you know I'm not going to
 
03:43:51.590 --> 03:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
to sign sign on for of course the
 
03:43:53.630 --> 03:43:53.640 align:start position:0%
legislature can direct me to
 
03:43:55.550 --> 03:43:55.560 align:start position:0%
stand on my head and spit wooden nickels
 
03:43:57.410 --> 03:43:57.420 align:start position:0%
if they'd like me to but I don't think
 
03:43:59.330 --> 03:43:59.340 align:start position:0%
that'll go over that'll work very well
 
03:44:02.150 --> 03:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
either and I I'm not trying to be snarky
 
03:44:04.370 --> 03:44:04.380 align:start position:0%
it's just there are only so many hours
 
03:44:07.010 --> 03:44:07.020 align:start position:0%
in the day there's only so much
 
03:44:09.410 --> 03:44:09.420 align:start position:0%
um expertise that we have and this is
 
03:44:13.610 --> 03:44:13.620 align:start position:0%
not one of one of those areas and um you
 
03:44:16.250 --> 03:44:16.260 align:start position:0%
know I did make a sincere attempt to see
 
03:44:19.849 --> 03:44:19.859 align:start position:0%
what are the opportunities for
 
03:44:22.510 --> 03:44:22.520 align:start position:0%
um for us to help
 
03:44:25.010 --> 03:44:25.020 align:start position:0%
farmers and it's way out of what
 
03:44:27.410 --> 03:44:27.420 align:start position:0%
normally happens I think that the trade
 
03:44:29.990 --> 03:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
organizations need to be the ones really
 
03:44:33.050 --> 03:44:33.060 align:start position:0%
looking out how do you apply for these
 
03:44:36.349 --> 03:44:36.359 align:start position:0%
things because where does it stop now
 
03:44:39.229 --> 03:44:39.239 align:start position:0%
we become a tax
 
03:44:41.570 --> 03:44:41.580 align:start position:0%
advice agency where we're going to give
 
03:44:44.410 --> 03:44:44.420 align:start position:0%
advice to everybody on well here's an
 
03:44:47.870 --> 03:44:47.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity for you individually I am
 
03:44:49.389 --> 03:44:49.399 align:start position:0%
very very happy
 
03:44:52.969 --> 03:44:52.979 align:start position:0%
to manage grants and to do that and as
 
03:44:55.190 --> 03:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
you heard last week I think this year
 
03:44:57.410 --> 03:44:57.420 align:start position:0%
you know we we are managing something
 
03:44:59.929 --> 03:44:59.939 align:start position:0%
like four and a half million dollars
 
03:45:02.450 --> 03:45:02.460 align:start position:0%
which you know is a couple million
 
03:45:05.690 --> 03:45:05.700 align:start position:0%
dollars less than our entire budget so I
 
03:45:08.929 --> 03:45:08.939 align:start position:0%
think we did do a pretty good job but
 
03:45:13.849 --> 03:45:13.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:16.490 --> 03:45:16.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr commissioner and I don't
 
03:45:18.710 --> 03:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
know when we'll schedule that bill uh
 
03:45:20.330 --> 03:45:20.340 align:start position:0%
having to do with you standing on your
 
03:45:20.340 --> 03:45:23.030 align:start position:0%
having to do with you standing on your
head

03:45:23.030 --> 03:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:23.040 --> 03:45:24.490 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:45:24.490 --> 03:45:24.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:45:26.870 --> 03:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
any members of the committee have a
 
03:45:29.990 --> 03:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
question for commissioner Jasper
 
03:45:32.330 --> 03:45:32.340 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your
 
03:45:34.610 --> 03:45:34.620 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
03:45:38.990 --> 03:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:48.830 --> 03:45:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:51.710 --> 03:45:51.720 align:start position:0%
welcome Mr Ming thank you
 
03:45:57.110 --> 03:45:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:59.990 --> 03:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
Madam chair Aaron Vice chair Creighton
 
03:46:01.910 --> 03:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
and members of the environment and
 
03:46:03.769 --> 03:46:03.779 align:start position:0%
agricultural committee my name is Ben
 
03:46:05.809 --> 03:46:05.819 align:start position:0%
Ming I'm a state representative from
 
03:46:07.250 --> 03:46:07.260 align:start position:0%
Hollis and I thank you for your time in
 
03:46:10.910 --> 03:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
listening to my support for HB 369 a
 
03:46:13.130 --> 03:46:13.140 align:start position:0%
bill with bipartisan sponsorship that
 
03:46:15.110 --> 03:46:15.120 align:start position:0%
seeks to establish a farm energy funding
 
03:46:16.250 --> 03:46:16.260 align:start position:0%
task force
 
03:46:18.349 --> 03:46:18.359 align:start position:0%
I'm not a farmer I don't and I don't
 
03:46:20.389 --> 03:46:20.399 align:start position:0%
work in the agricultural industry
 
03:46:22.130 --> 03:46:22.140 align:start position:0%
but agriculture is important to my
 
03:46:23.929 --> 03:46:23.939 align:start position:0%
district so I will be speaking about
 
03:46:26.630 --> 03:46:26.640 align:start position:0%
what it means to my community
 
03:46:28.130 --> 03:46:28.140 align:start position:0%
during the late summer and fall people
 
03:46:30.170 --> 03:46:30.180 align:start position:0%
descend on Hollis and towns like it to
 
03:46:32.990 --> 03:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
pick apples load up on corn and select
 
03:46:34.309 --> 03:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
the perfect pumpkin
 
03:46:35.690 --> 03:46:35.700 align:start position:0%
with the scenic fields and beautiful
 
03:46:38.090 --> 03:46:38.100 align:start position:0%
foliage it is truly the best time of
 
03:46:40.010 --> 03:46:40.020 align:start position:0%
year and we owe much of it to the
 
03:46:42.650 --> 03:46:42.660 align:start position:0%
multi-generational farming families that
 
03:46:45.469 --> 03:46:45.479 align:start position:0%
not only keep these Traditions alive
 
03:46:47.030 --> 03:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
but if shepherded the lands over the
 
03:46:49.610 --> 03:46:49.620 align:start position:0%
decades on behalf of a community that
 
03:46:53.330 --> 03:46:53.340 align:start position:0%
Above All Else values rural character
 
03:46:55.130 --> 03:46:55.140 align:start position:0%
over this past summer I was able to
 
03:46:56.929 --> 03:46:56.939 align:start position:0%
attend a legislative tour of Woodmont
 
03:46:59.630 --> 03:46:59.640 align:start position:0%
orchards in Hollis also in attendance
 
03:47:01.670 --> 03:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
was Kat McGee the prime sponsor of this
 
03:47:01.680 --> 03:47:02.750 align:start position:0%
was Kat McGee the prime sponsor of this
bill

03:47:02.750 --> 03:47:02.760 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:47:04.610 --> 03:47:04.620 align:start position:0%
we are treated to an explanation of how
 
03:47:05.990 --> 03:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
efficient farming
 
03:47:08.030 --> 03:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
was being used in our hometown and the
 
03:47:09.469 --> 03:47:09.479 align:start position:0%
state of agriculture in Hollis
 
03:47:11.450 --> 03:47:11.460 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough County and across New
 
03:47:11.460 --> 03:47:12.830 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough County and across New
Hampshire

03:47:12.830 --> 03:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:47:14.870 --> 03:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
a multitude of ways to potentially help
 
03:47:17.090 --> 03:47:17.100 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire agriculture were discussed
 
03:47:18.889 --> 03:47:18.899 align:start position:0%
at varying points of the presentation
 
03:47:21.050 --> 03:47:21.060 align:start position:0%
and in one-on-one conversations with
 
03:47:21.060 --> 03:47:22.490 align:start position:0%
and in one-on-one conversations with
farmers

03:47:22.490 --> 03:47:22.500 align:start position:0%
farmers
 
03:47:24.170 --> 03:47:24.180 align:start position:0%
this included supporting their labor
 
03:47:26.809 --> 03:47:26.819 align:start position:0%
force fixing a slow to non-existent
 
03:47:28.550 --> 03:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
educational pipeline
 
03:47:30.889 --> 03:47:30.899 align:start position:0%
and making Investments towards efficient
 
03:47:30.899 --> 03:47:32.150 align:start position:0%
and making Investments towards efficient
farming

03:47:32.150 --> 03:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
farming
 
03:47:34.790 --> 03:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
efficiency and more specifically no-till
 
03:47:37.010 --> 03:47:37.020 align:start position:0%
farming were the main focus of the day
 
03:47:38.690 --> 03:47:38.700 align:start position:0%
it allows cover crop to be flattened
 
03:47:40.309 --> 03:47:40.319 align:start position:0%
seeds to be planted and a few other
 
03:47:43.010 --> 03:47:43.020 align:start position:0%
things again I'm not a farmer
 
03:47:46.010 --> 03:47:46.020 align:start position:0%
and all done in a single pass
 
03:47:47.450 --> 03:47:47.460 align:start position:0%
this saves on the use of multiple
 
03:47:50.330 --> 03:47:50.340 align:start position:0%
machines Fuel and labor
 
03:47:53.210 --> 03:47:53.220 align:start position:0%
it's better for the land for the land
 
03:47:54.650 --> 03:47:54.660 align:start position:0%
and if there was a single point that was
 
03:47:56.510 --> 03:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
made about this level of efficient
 
03:47:56.520 --> 03:47:57.530 align:start position:0%
made about this level of efficient
farming

03:47:57.530 --> 03:47:57.540 align:start position:0%
farming
 
03:47:59.389 --> 03:47:59.399 align:start position:0%
it was that it required planning
 
03:48:02.450 --> 03:48:02.460 align:start position:0%
patients and a conscious and intentional
 
03:48:04.010 --> 03:48:04.020 align:start position:0%
investment at both the federal and state
 
03:48:06.290 --> 03:48:06.300 align:start position:0%
level to make it possible
 
03:48:08.150 --> 03:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
I also learned of the high energy costs
 
03:48:10.610 --> 03:48:10.620 align:start position:0%
in farming and how much of it could be
 
03:48:12.469 --> 03:48:12.479 align:start position:0%
offset by solar energy
 
03:48:14.090 --> 03:48:14.100 align:start position:0%
High electric bills are not just a
 
03:48:16.190 --> 03:48:16.200 align:start position:0%
problem for the average citizen this is
 
03:48:18.170 --> 03:48:18.180 align:start position:0%
why I'm here before you today
 
03:48:20.389 --> 03:48:20.399 align:start position:0%
the point of House Bill 369 is
 
03:48:20.399 --> 03:48:21.710 align:start position:0%
the point of House Bill 369 is
exploratory

03:48:21.710 --> 03:48:21.720 align:start position:0%
exploratory
 
03:48:23.450 --> 03:48:23.460 align:start position:0%
by creating the sublet Farm energy
 
03:48:26.690 --> 03:48:26.700 align:start position:0%
relief task force we are acknowledging
 
03:48:28.670 --> 03:48:28.680 align:start position:0%
one of the many challenges that New
 
03:48:30.769 --> 03:48:30.779 align:start position:0%
Hampshire farmers face
 
03:48:32.690 --> 03:48:32.700 align:start position:0%
they've made the effort to leverage
 
03:48:34.130 --> 03:48:34.140 align:start position:0%
federal funds earmarked for more
 
03:48:35.450 --> 03:48:35.460 align:start position:0%
efficient farming
 
03:48:36.950 --> 03:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
and I believe that if there's any
 
03:48:38.630 --> 03:48:38.640 align:start position:0%
possibility that the inflation reduction
 
03:48:40.670 --> 03:48:40.680 align:start position:0%
Act of 2022
 
03:48:42.229 --> 03:48:42.239 align:start position:0%
holds funds that could be used in
 
03:48:45.229 --> 03:48:45.239 align:start position:0%
advance use to advance their farming we
 
03:48:46.610 --> 03:48:46.620 align:start position:0%
owe them to make the effort to look for
 
03:48:46.620 --> 03:48:47.510 align:start position:0%
owe them to make the effort to look for
it

03:48:47.510 --> 03:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:48:51.050 --> 03:48:51.060 align:start position:0%
thank you and I'll take any questions
 
03:48:52.610 --> 03:48:52.620 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
03:48:55.790 --> 03:48:55.800 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
03:48:57.769 --> 03:48:57.779 align:start position:0%
representative Murray
 
03:48:59.330 --> 03:48:59.340 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you
 
03:48:59.340 --> 03:49:06.530 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you
representative

03:49:06.530 --> 03:49:06.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:08.570 --> 03:49:08.580 align:start position:0%
available to other folks outside of
 
03:49:10.849 --> 03:49:10.859 align:start position:0%
traditional farming that might be other
 
03:49:14.269 --> 03:49:14.279 align:start position:0%
types of agricultural producers
 
03:49:16.010 --> 03:49:16.020 align:start position:0%
um thank you for your question
 
03:49:18.710 --> 03:49:18.720 align:start position:0%
um I took a brief look at the handbook
 
03:49:21.229 --> 03:49:21.239 align:start position:0%
for the IRA and um I know one thing that
 
03:49:24.590 --> 03:49:24.600 align:start position:0%
stuck out to me was funding for
 
03:49:26.330 --> 03:49:26.340 align:start position:0%
um conservation plans
 
03:49:29.389 --> 03:49:29.399 align:start position:0%
uh that stuck out to me and it could be
 
03:49:30.530 --> 03:49:30.540 align:start position:0%
done through
 
03:49:32.929 --> 03:49:32.939 align:start position:0%
um your local select board I believe but
 
03:49:34.010 --> 03:49:34.020 align:start position:0%
that was
 
03:49:35.389 --> 03:49:35.399 align:start position:0%
just a brief look through of the
 
03:49:38.570 --> 03:49:38.580 align:start position:0%
handbook so um I believe so but I'd have
 
03:49:40.849 --> 03:49:40.859 align:start position:0%
to do a little more research
 
03:49:42.469 --> 03:49:42.479 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:49:45.229 --> 03:49:45.239 align:start position:0%
thank you representative burlard
 
03:49:48.229 --> 03:49:48.239 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh representative
 
03:49:51.229 --> 03:49:51.239 align:start position:0%
Ming has there been any contact with uh
 
03:49:54.349 --> 03:49:54.359 align:start position:0%
U.S congressman uh Chris Pappas or say
 
03:49:56.630 --> 03:49:56.640 align:start position:0%
Annie Custer
 
03:49:58.309 --> 03:49:58.319 align:start position:0%
um thank you on this issue oh yeah sure
 
03:49:59.990 --> 03:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your question
 
03:50:01.429 --> 03:50:01.439 align:start position:0%
um there hasn't
 
03:50:04.070 --> 03:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
um as a co-sponsor I've been and a first
 
03:50:06.650 --> 03:50:06.660 align:start position:0%
time rep I've been learning the ropes so
 
03:50:08.929 --> 03:50:08.939 align:start position:0%
um all all that information was kind of
 
03:50:10.250 --> 03:50:10.260 align:start position:0%
put on
 
03:50:12.769 --> 03:50:12.779 align:start position:0%
um representative McGee um so I think
 
03:50:14.809 --> 03:50:14.819 align:start position:0%
that question is probably best suited to
 
03:50:16.490 --> 03:50:16.500 align:start position:0%
to ask her
 
03:50:18.650 --> 03:50:18.660 align:start position:0%
I only ask because I'm sure they're the
 
03:50:20.990 --> 03:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
ones that voted for the inflation
 
03:50:22.490 --> 03:50:22.500 align:start position:0%
reduction act so
 
03:50:25.309 --> 03:50:25.319 align:start position:0%
it could be helpful to contact them yes
 
03:50:28.610 --> 03:50:28.620 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
03:50:31.490 --> 03:50:31.500 align:start position:0%

03:50:51.889 --> 03:50:51.899 align:start position:0%
activities that we have representative
 
03:50:54.349 --> 03:50:54.359 align:start position:0%
notice we have a representative from the
 
03:50:55.910 --> 03:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
Farm Bureau New Hampshire Farm Bureau
 
03:50:58.610 --> 03:50:58.620 align:start position:0%
here and I was wondering if uh he would
 
03:51:00.170 --> 03:51:00.180 align:start position:0%
be willing to
 
03:51:02.330 --> 03:51:02.340 align:start position:0%
um make any comment on the suggestion
 
03:51:04.250 --> 03:51:04.260 align:start position:0%
that the Farm Bureau might be a better
 
03:51:11.150 --> 03:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:13.910 --> 03:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
sorry to put you on the spot Rob please
 
03:51:18.530 --> 03:51:18.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:20.929 --> 03:51:20.939 align:start position:0%
Rob Johnson policy director of the New
 
03:51:22.370 --> 03:51:22.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Farm Bureau Federation and
 
03:51:24.710 --> 03:51:24.720 align:start position:0%
represent Bixby and NCT a question it's
 
03:51:26.630 --> 03:51:26.640 align:start position:0%
it's something we did sign in and
 
03:51:26.640 --> 03:51:27.370 align:start position:0%
it's something we did sign in and
support

03:51:27.370 --> 03:51:27.380 align:start position:0%
support
 
03:51:30.229 --> 03:51:30.239 align:start position:0%
we're well aware of the the resource
 
03:51:32.170 --> 03:51:32.180 align:start position:0%
challenges the Department of Agriculture
 
03:51:35.330 --> 03:51:35.340 align:start position:0%
as far as Farm Bureau doing something
 
03:51:38.330 --> 03:51:38.340 align:start position:0%
like this in New Hampshire uh I mean
 
03:51:39.830 --> 03:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
we're challenged as well it would have
 
03:51:41.630 --> 03:51:41.640 align:start position:0%
to be you know I have to go back to my
 
03:51:43.250 --> 03:51:43.260 align:start position:0%
board and would have to talk about it
 
03:51:44.809 --> 03:51:44.819 align:start position:0%
and see this you know what kind of a
 
03:51:48.650 --> 03:51:48.660 align:start position:0%
priority it is we a few years back see a
 
03:51:50.510 --> 03:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
few years back 10 12 years ago we did
 
03:51:53.389 --> 03:51:53.399 align:start position:0%
have a specific energy committee that
 
03:51:56.570 --> 03:51:56.580 align:start position:0%
did meet for a while I think like with a
 
03:51:59.510 --> 03:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
lot of things once the pandemic hit a
 
03:52:00.889 --> 03:52:00.899 align:start position:0%
lot of things fell by the wayside and
 
03:52:03.170 --> 03:52:03.180 align:start position:0%
that was one of them maybe it's time we
 
03:52:04.670 --> 03:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
need to reinvigorate that and look at
 
03:52:06.590 --> 03:52:06.600 align:start position:0%
something like this
 
03:52:08.929 --> 03:52:08.939 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Murray and
 
03:52:11.090 --> 03:52:11.100 align:start position:0%
would you mind also before before you
 
03:52:12.710 --> 03:52:12.720 align:start position:0%
leave to fill out a pink card so that we
 
03:52:15.710 --> 03:52:15.720 align:start position:0%
have it for the record will do go ahead
 
03:52:17.870 --> 03:52:17.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:52:19.610 --> 03:52:19.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Johnson for taking my
 
03:52:21.590 --> 03:52:21.600 align:start position:0%
question one of the questions that I did
 
03:52:24.650 --> 03:52:24.660 align:start position:0%
have was with regard to to
 
03:52:26.809 --> 03:52:26.819 align:start position:0%
folks who do help assist Farmers with
 
03:52:29.330 --> 03:52:29.340 align:start position:0%
grants what what type of experience do
 
03:52:31.550 --> 03:52:31.560 align:start position:0%
you have at the Farm Bureau with
 
03:52:33.349 --> 03:52:33.359 align:start position:0%
connecting them to resources for that
 
03:52:35.690 --> 03:52:35.700 align:start position:0%
need for grant writing
 
03:52:39.590 --> 03:52:39.600 align:start position:0%
not themselves but for resources to seek
 
03:52:40.550 --> 03:52:40.560 align:start position:0%
those grants
 
03:52:40.560 --> 03:52:42.110 align:start position:0%
those grants
yeah

03:52:42.110 --> 03:52:42.120 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:52:43.610 --> 03:52:43.620 align:start position:0%
we'd be pointing them in another
 
03:52:46.510 --> 03:52:46.520 align:start position:0%
direction we don't have anybody on staff
 
03:52:48.769 --> 03:52:48.779 align:start position:0%
but would be looking at corporate
 
03:52:51.110 --> 03:52:51.120 align:start position:0%
extension if possible usually usually if
 
03:52:52.790 --> 03:52:52.800 align:start position:0%
there's a grant that's usually a certain
 
03:52:55.309 --> 03:52:55.319 align:start position:0%
uh entity that that we're you know
 
03:52:56.870 --> 03:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
depending on the entity depending on the
 
03:52:59.030 --> 03:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
grant itself where we point them rural
 
03:53:01.010 --> 03:53:01.020 align:start position:0%
development USC rule development maybe
 
03:53:01.020 --> 03:53:01.969 align:start position:0%
development USC rule development maybe
another

03:53:01.969 --> 03:53:01.979 align:start position:0%
another
 
03:53:05.570 --> 03:53:05.580 align:start position:0%
and I should add too is the this the uh
 
03:53:08.510 --> 03:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
sponsor mentioned that she had this idea
 
03:53:10.670 --> 03:53:10.680 align:start position:0%
came out of Hollis and with in
 
03:53:12.830 --> 03:53:12.840 align:start position:0%
particular with uh Trevor high of
 
03:53:14.809 --> 03:53:14.819 align:start position:0%
Brookdale Fruit Farm uh Trevor is one of
 
03:53:16.250 --> 03:53:16.260 align:start position:0%
my bosses he sits on a board of
 
03:53:19.490 --> 03:53:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:22.729 --> 03:53:22.739 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any other questions for
 
03:53:24.530 --> 03:53:24.540 align:start position:0%
Mr Johnson
 
03:53:26.210 --> 03:53:26.220 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
 
03:53:26.220 --> 03:53:28.250 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
testimony

03:53:28.250 --> 03:53:28.260 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
03:53:31.610 --> 03:53:31.620 align:start position:0%
I guess that uh wraps it up for uh
 
03:53:35.269 --> 03:53:35.279 align:start position:0%
testimony on HB 369 according to the
 
03:53:37.790 --> 03:53:37.800 align:start position:0%
blue sheet we've got three people in
 
03:53:40.010 --> 03:53:40.020 align:start position:0%
favor of this legislation
 
03:53:43.670 --> 03:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
online we had five people in support and
 
03:53:46.130 --> 03:53:46.140 align:start position:0%
two people opposing
 
03:53:52.610 --> 03:53:52.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:54.830 --> 03:53:54.840 align:start position:0%
and my apologies to those folks waiting
 
03:53:56.990 --> 03:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
for hb252 which we were supposed to
 
03:54:00.050 --> 03:54:00.060 align:start position:0%
start at 1 30.
 
03:54:00.060 --> 03:54:01.610 align:start position:0%
start at 1 30.
and

03:54:01.610 --> 03:54:01.620 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:54:05.690 --> 03:54:05.700 align:start position:0%
um we give a moment for our clerk to
 
03:54:10.429 --> 03:54:10.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:16.910 --> 03:54:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:19.190 --> 03:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
which is exempting agricultural
 
03:54:21.530 --> 03:54:21.540 align:start position:0%
operations from certain Municipal noise
 
03:54:21.540 --> 03:54:23.210 align:start position:0%
operations from certain Municipal noise
ordinance

03:54:23.210 --> 03:54:23.220 align:start position:0%
ordinance
 
03:54:27.050 --> 03:54:27.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:32.990 --> 03:54:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:35.870 --> 03:54:35.880 align:start position:0%
our very own
 
03:54:42.070 --> 03:54:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:44.269 --> 03:54:44.279 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
 
03:54:44.279 --> 03:54:45.590 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
committee

03:54:45.590 --> 03:54:45.600 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:54:47.630 --> 03:54:47.640 align:start position:0%
uh the reason this bill has come about
 
03:54:49.910 --> 03:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
is over the summer it was brought to my
 
03:54:53.510 --> 03:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
attention and also in my own town that
 
03:54:55.070 --> 03:54:55.080 align:start position:0%
uh they're trying to put in noise
 
03:54:56.929 --> 03:54:56.939 align:start position:0%
ordinances that would have a negative
 
03:55:00.769 --> 03:55:00.779 align:start position:0%
impact uh to Farms
 
03:55:04.210 --> 03:55:04.220 align:start position:0%
um which would again go to Food security
 
03:55:07.429 --> 03:55:07.439 align:start position:0%
and uh people processing
 
03:55:09.889 --> 03:55:09.899 align:start position:0%
um so what this seeks to do is to exempt
 
03:55:12.830 --> 03:55:12.840 align:start position:0%
farming activities from any municipal or
 
03:55:14.530 --> 03:55:14.540 align:start position:0%
local noise ordinance
 
03:55:19.010 --> 03:55:19.020 align:start position:0%
the actual chapter 21 34A lies out
 
03:55:23.389 --> 03:55:23.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:27.050 --> 03:55:27.060 align:start position:0%
um it was brought to my attention that a
 
03:55:30.110 --> 03:55:30.120 align:start position:0%
amendment should come forth which I am
 
03:55:32.750 --> 03:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
willing to do dealing with agritourism
 
03:55:35.090 --> 03:55:35.100 align:start position:0%
should be exempt from this particular
 
03:55:35.100 --> 03:55:35.750 align:start position:0%
should be exempt from this particular
um

03:55:35.750 --> 03:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:55:38.870 --> 03:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
bill regarding noise ordinances
 
03:55:38.880 --> 03:55:39.889 align:start position:0%
bill regarding noise ordinances
um

03:55:39.889 --> 03:55:39.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:55:42.410 --> 03:55:42.420 align:start position:0%
over the summer I got a call from
 
03:55:45.110 --> 03:55:45.120 align:start position:0%
somebody in a town in
 
03:55:46.849 --> 03:55:46.859 align:start position:0%
Southern New Hampshire
 
03:55:49.189 --> 03:55:49.199 align:start position:0%
where the person the owner of the farm
 
03:55:52.130 --> 03:55:52.140 align:start position:0%
was spraying their apple orchard
 
03:55:54.950 --> 03:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
and if anyone understands farming in
 
03:55:57.889 --> 03:55:57.899 align:start position:0%
when spraying needs to be done it has to
 
03:56:00.590 --> 03:56:00.600 align:start position:0%
be done before the bees are out so very
 
03:56:01.969 --> 03:56:01.979 align:start position:0%
early in the morning
 
03:56:01.979 --> 03:56:03.349 align:start position:0%
early in the morning
or

03:56:03.349 --> 03:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:56:05.990 --> 03:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
at night when everything is basically
 
03:56:07.550 --> 03:56:07.560 align:start position:0%
shut down
 
03:56:09.530 --> 03:56:09.540 align:start position:0%
and the other thing you have to take
 
03:56:11.689 --> 03:56:11.699 align:start position:0%
into consideration is Windrift
 
03:56:13.790 --> 03:56:13.800 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of components that go
 
03:56:16.250 --> 03:56:16.260 align:start position:0%
into taking care of farms that people
 
03:56:20.090 --> 03:56:20.100 align:start position:0%
don't realize it's very scientific you
 
03:56:22.010 --> 03:56:22.020 align:start position:0%
have to monitor the weather you have to
 
03:56:23.809 --> 03:56:23.819 align:start position:0%
make sure it's not going to rain the
 
03:56:25.250 --> 03:56:25.260 align:start position:0%
next day you have to make sure it's not
 
03:56:28.070 --> 03:56:28.080 align:start position:0%
windy so that things don't spread and at
 
03:56:30.469 --> 03:56:30.479 align:start position:0%
this particular time it was nine o'clock
 
03:56:32.090 --> 03:56:32.100 align:start position:0%
in the evening when this Farm decided
 
03:56:34.070 --> 03:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
that this was the best time to do this
 
03:56:36.349 --> 03:56:36.359 align:start position:0%
so that there would be no Wind Drift or
 
03:56:38.769 --> 03:56:38.779 align:start position:0%
any application spreading to the
 
03:56:41.929 --> 03:56:41.939 align:start position:0%
properties next door
 
03:56:45.050 --> 03:56:45.060 align:start position:0%
the neighbors complained the town had a
 
03:56:46.429 --> 03:56:46.439 align:start position:0%
noise ordinance
 
03:56:50.510 --> 03:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
no noise after a certain time
 
03:56:54.170 --> 03:56:54.180 align:start position:0%
and so it ensued that town actually went
 
03:56:57.950 --> 03:56:57.960 align:start position:0%
ahead and put into a rule uh that that
 
03:57:01.010 --> 03:57:01.020 align:start position:0%
farm could actually do that but as we
 
03:57:03.889 --> 03:57:03.899 align:start position:0%
are increasing our populations and more
 
03:57:05.809 --> 03:57:05.819 align:start position:0%
people are moving into our rural areas
 
03:57:07.429 --> 03:57:07.439 align:start position:0%
we are finding that this is becoming
 
03:57:10.070 --> 03:57:10.080 align:start position:0%
more and more of an issue
 
03:57:10.080 --> 03:57:10.729 align:start position:0%
more and more of an issue
um

03:57:10.729 --> 03:57:10.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:10.739 --> 03:57:12.950 align:start position:0%
um
the

03:57:12.950 --> 03:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:57:15.050 --> 03:57:15.060 align:start position:0%
policy director was telling me of a
 
03:57:17.330 --> 03:57:17.340 align:start position:0%
story up in Littleton the chicken
 
03:57:19.429 --> 03:57:19.439 align:start position:0%
someone had a rooster
 
03:57:21.469 --> 03:57:21.479 align:start position:0%
and they put in noise ordinance now the
 
03:57:24.229 --> 03:57:24.239 align:start position:0%
roost had been there for quite some time
 
03:57:27.170 --> 03:57:27.180 align:start position:0%
and they decided to go after this
 
03:57:28.670 --> 03:57:28.680 align:start position:0%
particular person because the rooster
 
03:57:30.950 --> 03:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
crowed at the wrong time of day
 
03:57:33.650 --> 03:57:33.660 align:start position:0%
this particular person
 
03:57:35.510 --> 03:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
insulated their
 
03:57:38.030 --> 03:57:38.040 align:start position:0%
chicken house they put up room darkening
 
03:57:39.469 --> 03:57:39.479 align:start position:0%
Shades and everything else that they
 
03:57:41.090 --> 03:57:41.100 align:start position:0%
could possibly think of
 
03:57:43.189 --> 03:57:43.199 align:start position:0%
and yet the rooster still crowed well
 
03:57:45.830 --> 03:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
when the rooster wanted to Crow and
 
03:57:47.570 --> 03:57:47.580 align:start position:0%
therefore was forced to get rid of that
 
03:57:49.849 --> 03:57:49.859 align:start position:0%
these are some of the issues that we are
 
03:57:51.530 --> 03:57:51.540 align:start position:0%
facing in the farming and agricultural
 
03:57:51.540 --> 03:57:53.090 align:start position:0%
facing in the farming and agricultural
community

03:57:53.090 --> 03:57:53.100 align:start position:0%
community
 
03:57:55.070 --> 03:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
and it's becoming more and more
 
03:57:57.170 --> 03:57:57.180 align:start position:0%
prevalent more and more municipalities
 
03:57:58.790 --> 03:57:58.800 align:start position:0%
are putting in noise ordinances that
 
03:58:01.309 --> 03:58:01.319 align:start position:0%
have a negative adverse effect which
 
03:58:03.170 --> 03:58:03.180 align:start position:0%
will end up having an adverse effect on
 
03:58:04.550 --> 03:58:04.560 align:start position:0%
our food supply here in New Hampshire
 
03:58:07.189 --> 03:58:07.199 align:start position:0%
and as we all know or if we don't know
 
03:58:09.050 --> 03:58:09.060 align:start position:0%
we can only feed six percent of our
 
03:58:11.510 --> 03:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
population currently today with New
 
03:58:12.889 --> 03:58:12.899 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Farms
 
03:58:15.410 --> 03:58:15.420 align:start position:0%
I'd say that's pretty dismal so anything
 
03:58:18.050 --> 03:58:18.060 align:start position:0%
we can do to protect them I think it is
 
03:58:20.570 --> 03:58:20.580 align:start position:0%
in our best interest to do and I would
 
03:58:23.330 --> 03:58:23.340 align:start position:0%
ask that you would seriously consider
 
03:58:26.030 --> 03:58:26.040 align:start position:0%
this bill and I'm open for questions
 
03:58:28.070 --> 03:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative comp toy any
 
03:58:31.849 --> 03:58:31.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:34.010 --> 03:58:34.020 align:start position:0%
representative Knapp
 
03:58:35.510 --> 03:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
03:58:37.729 --> 03:58:37.739 align:start position:0%
taking my question I just wonder if you
 
03:58:40.309 --> 03:58:40.319 align:start position:0%
already have an exemption for
 
03:58:43.130 --> 03:58:43.140 align:start position:0%
agricultural businesses or farms in
 
03:58:46.010 --> 03:58:46.020 align:start position:0%
terms of noise ordinances
 
03:58:47.870 --> 03:58:47.880 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question I am not
 
03:58:49.790 --> 03:58:49.800 align:start position:0%
sure I do know that this particular
 
03:58:51.229 --> 03:58:51.239 align:start position:0%
problem happened in Pelham New Hampshire
 
03:58:54.530 --> 03:58:54.540 align:start position:0%
so they did put one in but they did call
 
03:58:56.750 --> 03:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
myself they talked to the commissioner
 
03:58:59.570 --> 03:58:59.580 align:start position:0%
and uh to the Farm Bureau so
 
03:59:02.750 --> 03:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
um but even in my town they try to put a
 
03:59:05.210 --> 03:59:05.220 align:start position:0%
noise ordinance in last year
 
03:59:06.710 --> 03:59:06.720 align:start position:0%
um fortunately I come from agricultural
 
03:59:10.010 --> 03:59:10.020 align:start position:0%
town we the farmers uh
 
03:59:12.950 --> 03:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
took exception and then they said they
 
03:59:14.510 --> 03:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
were going to put in a noise ordinance
 
03:59:16.189 --> 03:59:16.199 align:start position:0%
study committee
 
03:59:19.429 --> 03:59:19.439 align:start position:0%
um but it will have an adverse effect
 
03:59:22.010 --> 03:59:22.020 align:start position:0%
um as Farmers we we understand that you
 
03:59:23.630 --> 03:59:23.640 align:start position:0%
may have to start your tractor up at 1am
 
03:59:26.929 --> 03:59:26.939 align:start position:0%
in the morning to pull out a calf or you
 
03:59:28.849 --> 03:59:28.859 align:start position:0%
know there could be an emergency
 
03:59:30.889 --> 03:59:30.899 align:start position:0%
or you might have to chop down a tree
 
03:59:33.110 --> 03:59:33.120 align:start position:0%
that's on a uh you know one of your
 
03:59:36.950 --> 03:59:36.960 align:start position:0%
fences and to be told that you could be
 
03:59:41.030 --> 03:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
fined because of a noise ordinance is
 
03:59:45.650 --> 03:59:45.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:48.769 --> 03:59:48.779 align:start position:0%
uh representative I have a question
 
03:59:48.779 --> 03:59:49.910 align:start position:0%
uh representative I have a question
um

03:59:49.910 --> 03:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:59:51.769 --> 03:59:51.779 align:start position:0%
in your
 
03:59:56.389 --> 03:59:56.399 align:start position:0%
in your bill I guess it is on
 
03:59:56.399 --> 03:59:57.950 align:start position:0%
in your bill I guess it is on
line

03:59:57.950 --> 03:59:57.960 align:start position:0%
line
 
03:59:57.960 --> 03:59:59.750 align:start position:0%
line
seven

03:59:59.750 --> 03:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
seven
 
04:00:02.450 --> 04:00:02.460 align:start position:0%
wait a minute it says new paragraph
 
04:00:04.790 --> 04:00:04.800 align:start position:0%
powers of City councils bylaws and
 
04:00:04.800 --> 04:00:07.030 align:start position:0%
powers of City councils bylaws and
ordinances

04:00:07.030 --> 04:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
ordinances
 
04:00:11.210 --> 04:00:11.220 align:start position:0%
uh agricultural activities exempt amend
 
04:00:13.309 --> 04:00:13.319 align:start position:0%
RSA 47
 
04:00:15.590 --> 04:00:15.600 align:start position:0%
I think
 
04:00:20.030 --> 04:00:20.040 align:start position:0%
it might be 47 colon 17.
 
04:00:22.610 --> 04:00:22.620 align:start position:0%
I don't know that
 
04:00:24.650 --> 04:00:24.660 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair it says by
 
04:00:27.530 --> 04:00:27.540 align:start position:0%
inserting amend RSA 47 by inserting
 
04:00:31.250 --> 04:00:31.260 align:start position:0%
after paragraph 19 the following new
 
04:00:32.929 --> 04:00:32.939 align:start position:0%
paragraph So you're not taking something
 
04:00:34.870 --> 04:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
out you're putting in the new paragraph
 
04:00:36.830 --> 04:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
Yes but
 
04:00:38.750 --> 04:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
um the
 
04:00:38.760 --> 04:00:41.150 align:start position:0%
um the
47

04:00:41.150 --> 04:00:41.160 align:start position:0%
47
 
04:00:44.330 --> 04:00:44.340 align:start position:0%
is just uh powers of city councils and
 
04:00:50.090 --> 04:00:50.100 align:start position:0%
it lists 47 colon 1 through 47 colon 28.
 
04:00:51.889 --> 04:00:51.899 align:start position:0%
so I don't know
 
04:00:53.689 --> 04:00:53.699 align:start position:0%
where the
 
04:00:58.550 --> 04:00:58.560 align:start position:0%
X1 X well 19 Roman numeral goes unless
 
04:01:04.010 --> 04:01:04.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:07.670 --> 04:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
. thank you I do not have that Iris
 
04:01:10.130 --> 04:01:10.140 align:start position:0%
a in front of me I apologize uh we'll
 
04:01:11.990 --> 04:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
have to check the numbers then to make
 
04:01:13.189 --> 04:01:13.199 align:start position:0%
sure that
 
04:01:15.950 --> 04:01:15.960 align:start position:0%
we're looking at the right section of
 
04:01:19.729 --> 04:01:19.739 align:start position:0%
this RSA correct because I have RSA 3139
 
04:01:22.550 --> 04:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
printed out in RSA uh you know the
 
04:01:25.070 --> 04:01:25.080 align:start position:0%
chapter 2134a okay would you double
 
04:01:26.929 --> 04:01:26.939 align:start position:0%
check that then I will absolutely check
 
04:01:28.550 --> 04:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
that for you thank you
 
04:01:31.010 --> 04:01:31.020 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
04:01:33.889 --> 04:01:33.899 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby oh and I'll get to
 
04:01:33.899 --> 04:01:35.269 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby oh and I'll get to
you

04:01:35.269 --> 04:01:35.279 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:01:35.279 --> 04:01:36.410 align:start position:0%
you
so

04:01:36.410 --> 04:01:36.420 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:01:39.010 --> 04:01:39.020 align:start position:0%
um one thing that I I
 
04:01:43.370 --> 04:01:43.380 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of which body has control
 
04:01:47.769 --> 04:01:47.779 align:start position:0%
over uh things like noise and
 
04:01:52.429 --> 04:01:52.439 align:start position:0%
municipalities is the do
 
04:01:52.439 --> 04:01:53.450 align:start position:0%
municipalities is the do
um

04:01:53.450 --> 04:01:53.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:01:56.510 --> 04:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
do municipalities have home rules so
 
04:01:58.070 --> 04:01:58.080 align:start position:0%
they can make up the rules on their own
 
04:02:00.950 --> 04:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
or does that rule need to be given does
 
04:02:02.630 --> 04:02:02.640 align:start position:0%
that power need to be given to them by
 
04:02:06.590 --> 04:02:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:07.729 --> 04:02:07.739 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:02:10.130 --> 04:02:10.140 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby it is my
 
04:02:11.990 --> 04:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
understanding that if I'm looking
 
04:02:15.170 --> 04:02:15.180 align:start position:0%
correctly under the powers and duties of
 
04:02:18.590 --> 04:02:18.600 align:start position:0%
towns powers to make bylaws I believe
 
04:02:21.469 --> 04:02:21.479 align:start position:0%
that they can
 
04:02:23.330 --> 04:02:23.340 align:start position:0%
it says in here let me just look real
 
04:02:25.490 --> 04:02:25.500 align:start position:0%
quickly but I believe they are charged
 
04:02:27.650 --> 04:02:27.660 align:start position:0%
with where they can put in ordinances
 
04:02:29.450 --> 04:02:29.460 align:start position:0%
regarding noise
 
04:02:31.130 --> 04:02:31.140 align:start position:0%
okay so so in other words that's
 
04:02:32.630 --> 04:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
something that the state has delegated
 
04:02:35.210 --> 04:02:35.220 align:start position:0%
to them as as a power I believe that is
 
04:02:37.370 --> 04:02:37.380 align:start position:0%
correct if I go back through here and
 
04:02:39.769 --> 04:02:39.779 align:start position:0%
read it thank you
 
04:02:42.410 --> 04:02:42.420 align:start position:0%
representative Morse
 
04:02:44.630 --> 04:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
04:02:47.030 --> 04:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
question so um my question was very
 
04:02:49.250 --> 04:02:49.260 align:start position:0%
similar to Peter's but I'm also
 
04:02:53.090 --> 04:02:53.100 align:start position:0%
wondering if there's anything that you
 
04:02:54.889 --> 04:02:54.899 align:start position:0%
want to put in here about like the size
 
04:02:56.990 --> 04:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
of the farmer agriculture or is are we
 
04:02:59.809 --> 04:02:59.819 align:start position:0%
talking about the person who has three
 
04:03:02.030 --> 04:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
chickens and a rooster do they qualify
 
04:03:06.769 --> 04:03:06.779 align:start position:0%
as a farm and you know are we looking
 
04:03:06.779 --> 04:03:08.330 align:start position:0%
as a farm and you know are we looking
into

04:03:08.330 --> 04:03:08.340 align:start position:0%
into
 
04:03:10.969 --> 04:03:10.979 align:start position:0%
um like the size of the town or how
 
04:03:13.370 --> 04:03:13.380 align:start position:0%
rural they are compared to how Urban
 
04:03:16.130 --> 04:03:16.140 align:start position:0%
they are or will there be anything in
 
04:03:18.130 --> 04:03:18.140 align:start position:0%
that regard
 
04:03:19.910 --> 04:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:03:21.650 --> 04:03:21.660 align:start position:0%
representative Morse
 
04:03:21.660 --> 04:03:23.210 align:start position:0%
representative Morse
um

04:03:23.210 --> 04:03:23.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:25.370 --> 04:03:25.380 align:start position:0%
according to this and I'll just read
 
04:03:27.050 --> 04:03:27.060 align:start position:0%
this the word Farm means any land
 
04:03:30.290 --> 04:03:30.300 align:start position:0%
Building or structures on on or which in
 
04:03:32.150 --> 04:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
which Agriculture and farming are
 
04:03:34.429 --> 04:03:34.439 align:start position:0%
operations or activities are carried out
 
04:03:36.650 --> 04:03:36.660 align:start position:0%
or conducted and shall include the
 
04:03:38.210 --> 04:03:38.220 align:start position:0%
residences of residents of owners
 
04:03:40.910 --> 04:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
occupants or employees located on such
 
04:03:40.920 --> 04:03:42.490 align:start position:0%
occupants or employees located on such
land

04:03:42.490 --> 04:03:42.500 align:start position:0%
land
 
04:03:44.809 --> 04:03:44.819 align:start position:0%
that doesn't really give you a really
 
04:03:48.410 --> 04:03:48.420 align:start position:0%
good idea of what farming is
 
04:03:53.269 --> 04:03:53.279 align:start position:0%
but I don't believe that a backyard
 
04:03:56.030 --> 04:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
homeowner is considered a farm I think
 
04:03:59.330 --> 04:03:59.340 align:start position:0%
that there is a clear distinction
 
04:04:01.849 --> 04:04:01.859 align:start position:0%
um or somewhat but you have to
 
04:04:03.290 --> 04:04:03.300 align:start position:0%
understand there are people that are
 
04:04:05.870 --> 04:04:05.880 align:start position:0%
starting out small as you know you could
 
04:04:07.729 --> 04:04:07.739 align:start position:0%
have a farm on a quarter acre and do
 
04:04:10.729 --> 04:04:10.739 align:start position:0%
quite a lot of in Revenue
 
04:04:14.269 --> 04:04:14.279 align:start position:0%
um so if we look at size as a definition
 
04:04:17.269 --> 04:04:17.279 align:start position:0%
I think it will be detrimental to the
 
04:04:20.450 --> 04:04:20.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:20.460 --> 04:04:29.590 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:04:29.590 --> 04:04:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:32.389 --> 04:04:32.399 align:start position:0%
sorry representative Murray
 
04:04:41.450 --> 04:04:41.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:43.550 --> 04:04:43.560 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative Murray for
 
04:04:45.410 --> 04:04:45.420 align:start position:0%
the question
 
04:04:45.420 --> 04:04:47.929 align:start position:0%
the question
um

04:04:47.929 --> 04:04:47.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:49.550 --> 04:04:49.560 align:start position:0%
you know I would actually have to look
 
04:04:52.130 --> 04:04:52.140 align:start position:0%
up the definition of farm in statute
 
04:04:53.450 --> 04:04:53.460 align:start position:0%
um in order to do that and I don't have
 
04:04:55.189 --> 04:04:55.199 align:start position:0%
that in front of me and I do apologize
 
04:04:57.050 --> 04:04:57.060 align:start position:0%
for that
 
04:05:00.290 --> 04:05:00.300 align:start position:0%
um but it says here
 
04:05:02.150 --> 04:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
um it's husbandry of poultry or game
 
04:05:04.370 --> 04:05:04.380 align:start position:0%
birds husbandry of bees or production of
 
04:05:04.380 --> 04:05:05.809 align:start position:0%
birds husbandry of bees or production of
honey

04:05:05.809 --> 04:05:05.819 align:start position:0%
honey
 
04:05:08.570 --> 04:05:08.580 align:start position:0%
the production of greenhouse crops our
 
04:05:10.910 --> 04:05:10.920 align:start position:0%
practice or activity on the farm
 
04:05:12.830 --> 04:05:12.840 align:start position:0%
accident okay
 
04:05:15.410 --> 04:05:15.420 align:start position:0%
um preparation
 
04:05:17.750 --> 04:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
you know for Market
 
04:05:19.849 --> 04:05:19.859 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of components to
 
04:05:23.090 --> 04:05:23.100 align:start position:0%
farming so you know you might be
 
04:05:25.610 --> 04:05:25.620 align:start position:0%
homesteading but you also might be a
 
04:05:27.170 --> 04:05:27.180 align:start position:0%
small farm at the same time because
 
04:05:28.550 --> 04:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
maybe you're going to the farmers
 
04:05:30.650 --> 04:05:30.660 align:start position:0%
markets to sell you Wares in hopes that
 
04:05:31.910 --> 04:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
you grow
 
04:05:33.830 --> 04:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
I mean
 
04:05:36.530 --> 04:05:36.540 align:start position:0%
we need everyone to be participating in
 
04:05:39.170 --> 04:05:39.180 align:start position:0%
our local food economy so that we can be
 
04:05:43.550 --> 04:05:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:45.889 --> 04:05:45.899 align:start position:0%
representative NAB
 
04:05:47.090 --> 04:05:47.100 align:start position:0%
um I apologize for not knowing this
 
04:05:48.469 --> 04:05:48.479 align:start position:0%
because it might have been in the
 
04:05:49.910 --> 04:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
farming definition but does timber
 
04:05:52.010 --> 04:05:52.020 align:start position:0%
harvesting fall into this category and
 
04:05:53.990 --> 04:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
so would logging operations also be
 
04:05:56.689 --> 04:05:56.699 align:start position:0%
included in these in this restriction
 
04:05:58.729 --> 04:05:58.739 align:start position:0%
thank you representative NAB for that
 
04:06:04.130 --> 04:06:04.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:07.910 --> 04:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:10.429 --> 04:06:10.439 align:start position:0%
thank you representative thank you madam
 
04:06:10.439 --> 04:06:11.630 align:start position:0%
thank you representative thank you madam
chair

04:06:11.630 --> 04:06:11.640 align:start position:0%
chair
 
04:06:15.590 --> 04:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
I'd like to call on Nat's Grace
 
04:06:19.010 --> 04:06:19.020 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire Municipal Association
 
04:06:20.929 --> 04:06:20.939 align:start position:0%
good afternoon and welcome to
 
04:06:22.910 --> 04:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
environment agriculture thank you madam
 
04:06:25.070 --> 04:06:25.080 align:start position:0%
chair I'm not usually in this committee
 
04:06:26.630 --> 04:06:26.640 align:start position:0%
um so I'll just introduce myself briefly
 
04:06:28.309 --> 04:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
I'm Nate Graves with the municipal
 
04:06:30.530 --> 04:06:30.540 align:start position:0%
Association we're voluntary membership
 
04:06:32.809 --> 04:06:32.819 align:start position:0%
organization of cities and towns
 
04:06:34.250 --> 04:06:34.260 align:start position:0%
throughout New Hampshire we currently
 
04:06:36.889 --> 04:06:36.899 align:start position:0%
are comprised of all 234 cities and
 
04:06:39.710 --> 04:06:39.720 align:start position:0%
towns we provide legal advice uh
 
04:06:41.870 --> 04:06:41.880 align:start position:0%
training and of course come here and
 
04:06:44.570 --> 04:06:44.580 align:start position:0%
Advocate and we do oppose legislation
 
04:06:45.910 --> 04:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
that would directly
 
04:06:47.929 --> 04:06:47.939 align:start position:0%
take away from existing local
 
04:06:49.969 --> 04:06:49.979 align:start position:0%
authorities so we are opposing this
 
04:06:52.729 --> 04:06:52.739 align:start position:0%
legislation I apologize I haven't had a
 
04:06:55.189 --> 04:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
chance to speak with the prime sponsor
 
04:06:59.269 --> 04:06:59.279 align:start position:0%
about this bill in particular
 
04:07:01.429 --> 04:07:01.439 align:start position:0%
um a number of you had some specific
 
04:07:03.110 --> 04:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
questions we'll start with you madam
 
04:07:05.110 --> 04:07:05.120 align:start position:0%
chair uh you are correct that it is
 
04:07:08.809 --> 04:07:08.819 align:start position:0%
47.17 that you'd like to um you'd like
 
04:07:11.510 --> 04:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
to add in that colon 17.
 
04:07:11.520 --> 04:07:12.170 align:start position:0%
to add in that colon 17.
um

04:07:12.170 --> 04:07:12.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:14.210 --> 04:07:14.220 align:start position:0%
as far as I understand for the
 
04:07:18.050 --> 04:07:18.060 align:start position:0%
definition of farm under 2134 for a and
 
04:07:20.150 --> 04:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
I don't normally practice in this area
 
04:07:23.389 --> 04:07:23.399 align:start position:0%
of law so I I'm not 100 certain but it
 
04:07:25.090 --> 04:07:25.100 align:start position:0%
is a very broad definition
 
04:07:28.429 --> 04:07:28.439 align:start position:0%
I don't believe it's limited in terms of
 
04:07:30.349 --> 04:07:30.359 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
04:07:35.830 --> 04:07:35.840 align:start position:0%
how much actual acreage is in production
 
04:07:38.570 --> 04:07:38.580 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby asked a question
 
04:07:41.090 --> 04:07:41.100 align:start position:0%
about whether municipalities already are
 
04:07:43.910 --> 04:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
charged with um regulating noise and
 
04:07:47.150 --> 04:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
they they are towns are under
 
04:07:52.309 --> 04:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
um 3139 and cities under 47-17
 
04:07:52.319 --> 04:07:53.990 align:start position:0%
um 3139 and cities under 47-17
um

04:07:53.990 --> 04:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:54.000 --> 04:07:55.630 align:start position:0%
um
it

04:07:55.630 --> 04:07:55.640 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:07:57.889 --> 04:07:57.899 align:start position:0%
realistically putting in noise
 
04:08:00.590 --> 04:08:00.600 align:start position:0%
ordinances is very complicated
 
04:08:02.330 --> 04:08:02.340 align:start position:0%
um a number of noise ordinances have
 
04:08:03.590 --> 04:08:03.600 align:start position:0%
been struck down over the years because
 
04:08:06.469 --> 04:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
they haven't been specific enough if we
 
04:08:08.210 --> 04:08:08.220 align:start position:0%
were contacted to provide advice to
 
04:08:11.450 --> 04:08:11.460 align:start position:0%
municipalities about them we would
 
04:08:13.490 --> 04:08:13.500 align:start position:0%
suggest that they do something involving
 
04:08:16.550 --> 04:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
decibels and decibel levels and also
 
04:08:18.229 --> 04:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
look at the type of activity that's
 
04:08:20.030 --> 04:08:20.040 align:start position:0%
going on in their communities and
 
04:08:22.550 --> 04:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
appropriately gauge that activity you
 
04:08:24.650 --> 04:08:24.660 align:start position:0%
know if you have whether it's
 
04:08:26.389 --> 04:08:26.399 align:start position:0%
agriculture activity or something you
 
04:08:28.010 --> 04:08:28.020 align:start position:0%
know a cement plant or something and
 
04:08:29.650 --> 04:08:29.660 align:start position:0%
that's a major employer in your town
 
04:08:32.809 --> 04:08:32.819 align:start position:0%
obviously it's not very wise to pass an
 
04:08:34.910 --> 04:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
ordinance that would effectively Outlaw
 
04:08:38.210 --> 04:08:38.220 align:start position:0%
or make their business difficult
 
04:08:40.010 --> 04:08:40.020 align:start position:0%
um so while there is no
 
04:08:44.150 --> 04:08:44.160 align:start position:0%
currently existing uh requirement that
 
04:08:46.370 --> 04:08:46.380 align:start position:0%
um they take that into consideration and
 
04:08:48.650 --> 04:08:48.660 align:start position:0%
certainly Our advice that you look at
 
04:08:51.889 --> 04:08:51.899 align:start position:0%
what your town does and appropriately uh
 
04:08:55.370 --> 04:08:55.380 align:start position:0%
gauge your uh gauge your ordinance and
 
04:08:57.769 --> 04:08:57.779 align:start position:0%
of course given that it is something
 
04:09:01.010 --> 04:09:01.020 align:start position:0%
adopted at town meeting for towns it's
 
04:09:02.570 --> 04:09:02.580 align:start position:0%
something that's open for debate and
 
04:09:04.130 --> 04:09:04.140 align:start position:0%
hopefully uh there's a robust
 
04:09:06.950 --> 04:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
conversation about that
 
04:09:06.960 --> 04:09:08.389 align:start position:0%
conversation about that
um

04:09:08.389 --> 04:09:08.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:10.969 --> 04:09:10.979 align:start position:0%
and that's that's really what I I wanted
 
04:09:13.189 --> 04:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
to offer certainly I'm happy
 
04:09:13.199 --> 04:09:14.510 align:start position:0%
to offer certainly I'm happy
um to

04:09:14.510 --> 04:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
um to
 
04:09:16.490 --> 04:09:16.500 align:start position:0%
make the suggestion that if if the
 
04:09:17.990 --> 04:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
committee believes that it's the case
 
04:09:19.969 --> 04:09:19.979 align:start position:0%
that this is a
 
04:09:19.979 --> 04:09:20.990 align:start position:0%
that this is a
um

04:09:20.990 --> 04:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:23.630 --> 04:09:23.640 align:start position:0%
a training a training or education issue
 
04:09:25.910 --> 04:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
we do provide uh training and education
 
04:09:28.610 --> 04:09:28.620 align:start position:0%
to our members we did some around 80
 
04:09:30.950 --> 04:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
events with 40 staff members last year
 
04:09:32.750 --> 04:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
certainly I'm happy to put this on the
 
04:09:32.760 --> 04:09:33.710 align:start position:0%
certainly I'm happy to put this on the
docket

04:09:33.710 --> 04:09:33.720 align:start position:0%
docket
 
04:09:35.450 --> 04:09:35.460 align:start position:0%
um and do some specific reach out as
 
04:09:37.070 --> 04:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
well I'm happy to take any questions the
 
04:09:38.929 --> 04:09:38.939 align:start position:0%
committee may have thank you
 
04:09:41.570 --> 04:09:41.580 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby
 
04:09:44.809 --> 04:09:44.819 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so um
 
04:09:47.450 --> 04:09:47.460 align:start position:0%
if we were to go ahead with this bill uh
 
04:09:49.429 --> 04:09:49.439 align:start position:0%
would it make it more palatable to your
 
04:09:53.689 --> 04:09:53.699 align:start position:0%
organization if we were to exclude uh
 
04:09:59.450 --> 04:09:59.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:01.189 --> 04:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
so I'd have to look up the definition of
 
04:10:04.250 --> 04:10:04.260 align:start position:0%
agriculture agritourism again
 
04:10:08.809 --> 04:10:08.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:11.150 --> 04:10:11.160 align:start position:0%
under the land use statutes agritourism
 
04:10:14.330 --> 04:10:14.340 align:start position:0%
is protected uh protected use much like
 
04:10:17.150 --> 04:10:17.160 align:start position:0%
agricultural use so for example if I
 
04:10:18.729 --> 04:10:18.739 align:start position:0%
want to put a
 
04:10:21.229 --> 04:10:21.239 align:start position:0%
Farm Stand in my front yard selling
 
04:10:23.150 --> 04:10:23.160 align:start position:0%
vegetables that I grow there I'm allowed
 
04:10:24.830 --> 04:10:24.840 align:start position:0%
to do that the municipality can't stop
 
04:10:24.840 --> 04:10:26.210 align:start position:0%
to do that the municipality can't stop
me

04:10:26.210 --> 04:10:26.220 align:start position:0%
me
 
04:10:26.220 --> 04:10:27.410 align:start position:0%
me
um

04:10:27.410 --> 04:10:27.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:29.349 --> 04:10:29.359 align:start position:0%
I guess the
 
04:10:31.490 --> 04:10:31.500 align:start position:0%
realistically what our position is is
 
04:10:35.150 --> 04:10:35.160 align:start position:0%
that we have to protect our our charges
 
04:10:37.429 --> 04:10:37.439 align:start position:0%
to protect um existing local authorities
 
04:10:39.469 --> 04:10:39.479 align:start position:0%
so I I don't think there's a lot of room
 
04:10:43.610 --> 04:10:43.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:47.269 --> 04:10:47.279 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
04:10:50.150 --> 04:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
04:10:52.729 --> 04:10:52.739 align:start position:0%
I'd like to call up now um Bob Johnson
 
04:11:03.910 --> 04:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:05.510 --> 04:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:11:14.030 --> 04:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:16.130 --> 04:11:16.140 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
 
04:11:17.630 --> 04:11:17.640 align:start position:0%
committee again for the record Rob
 
04:11:19.790 --> 04:11:19.800 align:start position:0%
Johnson representing the New Hampshire
 
04:11:22.610 --> 04:11:22.620 align:start position:0%
Farm Bureau as the federation's policy
 
04:11:24.769 --> 04:11:24.779 align:start position:0%
director and this is my well second time
 
04:11:26.570 --> 04:11:26.580 align:start position:0%
now up to speak I haven't planned on
 
04:11:28.849 --> 04:11:28.859 align:start position:0%
speaking before let me take a minute or
 
04:11:30.050 --> 04:11:30.060 align:start position:0%
so tell you a little bit about Farm
 
04:11:34.490 --> 04:11:34.500 align:start position:0%
Bureau where a non-profit Federation of
 
04:11:36.110 --> 04:11:36.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's 10 County Farm Bureau
 
04:11:38.210 --> 04:11:38.220 align:start position:0%
organizations those organizations
 
04:11:41.870 --> 04:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
consist of a total of about uh 3 000
 
04:11:44.689 --> 04:11:44.699 align:start position:0%
members of those members or mostly
 
04:11:48.050 --> 04:11:48.060 align:start position:0%
family members or 1800 1900 our farmer
 
04:11:50.870 --> 04:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
members remaining are supporting members
 
04:11:53.689 --> 04:11:53.699 align:start position:0%
and businesses and we are what we call a
 
04:11:55.670 --> 04:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
a Grassroots organization where our
 
04:11:57.590 --> 04:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
policy is developed from our members up
 
04:12:00.830 --> 04:12:00.840 align:start position:0%
we're a general Farm organization where
 
04:12:03.290 --> 04:12:03.300 align:start position:0%
we represent all types of Agriculture
 
04:12:03.300 --> 04:12:04.910 align:start position:0%
we represent all types of Agriculture
and

04:12:04.910 --> 04:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:12:04.920 --> 04:12:05.689 align:start position:0%
and
um

04:12:05.689 --> 04:12:05.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:07.910 --> 04:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
just a little background on the history
 
04:12:09.769 --> 04:12:09.779 align:start position:0%
been in existence just over a hundred
 
04:12:13.429 --> 04:12:13.439 align:start position:0%
years and we started back at the the
 
04:12:15.889 --> 04:12:15.899 align:start position:0%
early 1900s when the federal government
 
04:12:19.490 --> 04:12:19.500 align:start position:0%
uh said to uh the the counties that if
 
04:12:22.250 --> 04:12:22.260 align:start position:0%
if you want a County Extension agent an
 
04:12:23.450 --> 04:12:23.460 align:start position:0%
AG agent what are now called
 
04:12:25.849 --> 04:12:25.859 align:start position:0%
agricultural Educators if you want one
 
04:12:28.490 --> 04:12:28.500 align:start position:0%
of a nag agent in your county you need
 
04:12:31.729 --> 04:12:31.739 align:start position:0%
to show proof by having a a farm
 
04:12:33.469 --> 04:12:33.479 align:start position:0%
organization established and that's how
 
04:12:35.330 --> 04:12:35.340 align:start position:0%
the Farm Bureau started we and we
 
04:12:37.010 --> 04:12:37.020 align:start position:0%
maintain our close relationship with
 
04:12:39.950 --> 04:12:39.960 align:start position:0%
Cooperative Extension to this day
 
04:12:44.330 --> 04:12:44.340 align:start position:0%
um as far as uh 252 goes we we are we
 
04:12:47.210 --> 04:12:47.220 align:start position:0%
are supportive uh we we would like to
 
04:12:51.769 --> 04:12:51.779 align:start position:0%
see uh some Protections in statute
 
04:12:54.830 --> 04:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
where I hear the issue most often in
 
04:12:56.990 --> 04:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
representative quantois alluded to it
 
04:13:01.010 --> 04:13:01.020 align:start position:0%
regarding roosters uh is a big one and
 
04:13:03.950 --> 04:13:03.960 align:start position:0%
then tractors and then uh farm equipment
 
04:13:05.750 --> 04:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
is another one and she also alluded to
 
04:13:10.370 --> 04:13:10.380 align:start position:0%
with sprayers is is is an area and again
 
04:13:12.769 --> 04:13:12.779 align:start position:0%
as you all think are aware agriculture
 
04:13:16.729 --> 04:13:16.739 align:start position:0%
is is a weather dependent and that's
 
04:13:19.250 --> 04:13:19.260 align:start position:0%
whether that's rain whether that's wind
 
04:13:21.830 --> 04:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
whether that's heat cold that type of
 
04:13:24.349 --> 04:13:24.359 align:start position:0%
thing and when you're talking about
 
04:13:27.349 --> 04:13:27.359 align:start position:0%
spraying you you need to spray when
 
04:13:30.110 --> 04:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
there is no wind and that requires the
 
04:13:32.689 --> 04:13:32.699 align:start position:0%
most most commonly the the wind is down
 
04:13:34.670 --> 04:13:34.680 align:start position:0%
early in the day or late in the evening
 
04:13:37.849 --> 04:13:37.859 align:start position:0%
and so in in where the issues come about
 
04:13:40.490 --> 04:13:40.500 align:start position:0%
is where there's people move in from
 
04:13:42.650 --> 04:13:42.660 align:start position:0%
outside may not be familiar with
 
04:13:45.229 --> 04:13:45.239 align:start position:0%
agriculture or the area and then as a
 
04:13:47.450 --> 04:13:47.460 align:start position:0%
and then you get into it with us there's
 
04:13:49.910 --> 04:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
complaints and it's it can be you're
 
04:13:51.050 --> 04:13:51.060 align:start position:0%
going to say it doesn't happen a whole
 
04:13:53.330 --> 04:13:53.340 align:start position:0%
lot but it can be a real error to a
 
04:13:55.309 --> 04:13:55.319 align:start position:0%
farmer trying to deal with this issue
 
04:13:58.370 --> 04:13:58.380 align:start position:0%
because when it comes to noise it I I
 
04:14:00.710 --> 04:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
I'd say it's quite subjective what can
 
04:14:04.610 --> 04:14:04.620 align:start position:0%
be noisy to one person is not to another
 
04:14:07.189 --> 04:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
and it's it's kind of like with odors as
 
04:14:10.130 --> 04:14:10.140 align:start position:0%
well it's a it's a real Challenge on
 
04:14:12.650 --> 04:14:12.660 align:start position:0%
dealing with it I passed out the the
 
04:14:14.510 --> 04:14:14.520 align:start position:0%
state definition of agriculture I would
 
04:14:19.550 --> 04:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
say 21 colon 34-a and in a kind of in
 
04:14:21.889 --> 04:14:21.899 align:start position:0%
looking at moving this forward which we
 
04:14:25.150 --> 04:14:25.160 align:start position:0%
would like to see that that as as the
 
04:14:28.729 --> 04:14:28.739 align:start position:0%
municipal Association pointed out 2134a
 
04:14:31.010 --> 04:14:31.020 align:start position:0%
is very Broad in that in many ways it's
 
04:14:32.809 --> 04:14:32.819 align:start position:0%
a good thing but when you're trying to
 
04:14:35.210 --> 04:14:35.220 align:start position:0%
insert it into this legislation it's
 
04:14:37.130 --> 04:14:37.140 align:start position:0%
probably it's probably it's too broad we
 
04:14:41.090 --> 04:14:41.100 align:start position:0%
recognize that agritourism is asked
 
04:14:43.490 --> 04:14:43.500 align:start position:0%
earlier is included and you'll see that
 
04:14:46.370 --> 04:14:46.380 align:start position:0%
I highlighted it the irsa has section
 
04:14:48.830 --> 04:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
two it's the words Agriculture and
 
04:14:50.510 --> 04:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
farming mean all operations or
 
04:14:53.090 --> 04:14:53.100 align:start position:0%
activities they'll Farm in including in
 
04:14:54.950 --> 04:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
that section A that really gets into
 
04:14:57.590 --> 04:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
what most people consider the heart and
 
04:15:00.650 --> 04:15:00.660 align:start position:0%
soul of Agriculture the cropping of land
 
04:15:02.870 --> 04:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
in the in the care and raising of
 
04:15:04.849 --> 04:15:04.859 align:start position:0%
livestock and then when you get into B
 
04:15:07.309 --> 04:15:07.319 align:start position:0%
which is you turn the page that's where
 
04:15:09.170 --> 04:15:09.180 align:start position:0%
you get into the incidental practices
 
04:15:12.469 --> 04:15:12.479 align:start position:0%
and that's where agriters agritourism is
 
04:15:15.590 --> 04:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
included so again if we we would like to
 
04:15:18.229 --> 04:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
see the the bill move forward but I I
 
04:15:20.030 --> 04:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
think you that does need to be put some
 
04:15:23.030 --> 04:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
sideboards on that and and that it'd be
 
04:15:25.309 --> 04:15:25.319 align:start position:0%
really uh
 
04:15:27.290 --> 04:15:27.300 align:start position:0%
you come up with something that where
 
04:15:29.210 --> 04:15:29.220 align:start position:0%
there's some limitations whether it be
 
04:15:32.030 --> 04:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
you know in in rural zones could be uh
 
04:15:33.769 --> 04:15:33.779 align:start position:0%
an area but
 
04:15:33.779 --> 04:15:39.290 align:start position:0%
an area but
um

04:15:39.290 --> 04:15:39.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:41.450 --> 04:15:41.460 align:start position:0%
and I I Madam I guess I'll leave my
 
04:15:44.150 --> 04:15:44.160 align:start position:0%
testimony uh that thank you thank you
 
04:15:46.729 --> 04:15:46.739 align:start position:0%
very much questions representative Knapp
 
04:15:49.189 --> 04:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Madam chair I just
 
04:15:51.469 --> 04:15:51.479 align:start position:0%
um so the the language of the log stops
 
04:15:53.389 --> 04:15:53.399 align:start position:0%
farming and agriculture agricultural
 
04:15:53.399 --> 04:15:54.530 align:start position:0%
farming and agriculture agricultural
operations

04:15:54.530 --> 04:15:54.540 align:start position:0%
operations
 
04:15:57.229 --> 04:15:57.239 align:start position:0%
um but in this statute I would I'm
 
04:15:59.510 --> 04:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
concerned and I wonder if you are the
 
04:15:59.520 --> 04:16:01.429 align:start position:0%
concerned and I wonder if you are the
sponsor

04:16:01.429 --> 04:16:01.439 align:start position:0%
sponsor
 
04:16:03.229 --> 04:16:03.239 align:start position:0%
um thinks that farm would be included
 
04:16:05.030 --> 04:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
because then you do get into the
 
04:16:07.130 --> 04:16:07.140 align:start position:0%
residence of the farmer and is there the
 
04:16:08.570 --> 04:16:08.580 align:start position:0%
possibility of someone working on their
 
04:16:10.790 --> 04:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
own house and that being included within
 
04:16:10.800 --> 04:16:11.929 align:start position:0%
own house and that being included within
this

04:16:11.929 --> 04:16:11.939 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:16:15.349 --> 04:16:15.359 align:start position:0%
this permit or this the the way the bill
 
04:16:17.410 --> 04:16:17.420 align:start position:0%
is drafted it it's
 
04:16:19.969 --> 04:16:19.979 align:start position:0%
2134a encompassing Farm Agriculture and
 
04:16:21.410 --> 04:16:21.420 align:start position:0%
farming and that's why we're that's why
 
04:16:23.330 --> 04:16:23.340 align:start position:0%
we're saying it it does make it very
 
04:16:25.130 --> 04:16:25.140 align:start position:0%
Broad and maybe if you if it were
 
04:16:27.469 --> 04:16:27.479 align:start position:0%
limited to the you know look in that
 
04:16:31.969 --> 04:16:31.979 align:start position:0%
sections uh 2A and B you're correct as
 
04:16:33.950 --> 04:16:33.960 align:start position:0%
written it does include Farm which does
 
04:16:36.229 --> 04:16:36.239 align:start position:0%
include uh the the residents of the
 
04:16:38.809 --> 04:16:38.819 align:start position:0%
farmer and employee uh housing as well
 
04:16:40.610 --> 04:16:40.620 align:start position:0%
thank you all right can I ask a
 
04:16:42.110 --> 04:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
follow-up should the other place that I
 
04:16:43.849 --> 04:16:43.859 align:start position:0%
would ask about or that gives me pause
 
04:16:45.769 --> 04:16:45.779 align:start position:0%
is the writing instruction of equines
 
04:16:47.870 --> 04:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
because I think that also might be
 
04:16:49.429 --> 04:16:49.439 align:start position:0%
outside of what people think of as
 
04:16:51.830 --> 04:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
farming if you are teaching horse
 
04:16:51.840 --> 04:16:53.389 align:start position:0%
farming if you are teaching horse
lessons

04:16:53.389 --> 04:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
lessons
 
04:16:56.090 --> 04:16:56.100 align:start position:0%
um and not so it you know I just I guess
 
04:16:57.469 --> 04:16:57.479 align:start position:0%
I would question how broad this whole
 
04:16:59.269 --> 04:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
definition is which you you are speaking
 
04:16:59.279 --> 04:17:00.349 align:start position:0%
definition is which you you are speaking
to

04:17:00.349 --> 04:17:00.359 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:17:03.050 --> 04:17:03.060 align:start position:0%
um how broadly we would interpreted for
 
04:17:06.110 --> 04:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
for a noise ordinance yeah I mean we
 
04:17:08.389 --> 04:17:08.399 align:start position:0%
would include equine as agriculture yeah
 
04:17:11.030 --> 04:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
in the in that statue clearly does
 
04:17:14.330 --> 04:17:14.340 align:start position:0%
including a Writing Center
 
04:17:14.340 --> 04:17:17.210 align:start position:0%
including a Writing Center
correct

04:17:17.210 --> 04:17:17.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:19.130 --> 04:17:19.140 align:start position:0%
so I have a question
 
04:17:19.140 --> 04:17:20.689 align:start position:0%
so I have a question
um

04:17:20.689 --> 04:17:20.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:22.910 --> 04:17:22.920 align:start position:0%
in your experience
 
04:17:26.030 --> 04:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
where you've heard that farmers or
 
04:17:28.910 --> 04:17:28.920 align:start position:0%
members of the rural community
 
04:17:32.630 --> 04:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
have had complaints against them for
 
04:17:35.689 --> 04:17:35.699 align:start position:0%
whatever noises come from their
 
04:17:35.699 --> 04:17:37.490 align:start position:0%
whatever noises come from their
place

04:17:37.490 --> 04:17:37.500 align:start position:0%
place
 
04:17:39.950 --> 04:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
do you know what has happened is that
 
04:17:42.050 --> 04:17:42.060 align:start position:0%
have they had to cease and desist were
 
04:17:42.060 --> 04:17:43.070 align:start position:0%
have they had to cease and desist were
they

04:17:43.070 --> 04:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
they
 
04:17:45.530 --> 04:17:45.540 align:start position:0%
threatened with lawsuits or
 
04:17:48.889 --> 04:17:48.899 align:start position:0%
how how much of I mean I know that noise
 
04:17:51.650 --> 04:17:51.660 align:start position:0%
has been a problem for people who are
 
04:17:53.389 --> 04:17:53.399 align:start position:0%
not familiar with it and move into an
 
04:17:55.070 --> 04:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
area and then they say oh my God you
 
04:17:56.570 --> 04:17:56.580 align:start position:0%
know the Sawmill is making all this
 
04:17:56.580 --> 04:17:58.189 align:start position:0%
know the Sawmill is making all this
noise

04:17:58.189 --> 04:17:58.199 align:start position:0%
noise
 
04:18:01.070 --> 04:18:01.080 align:start position:0%
um how how much of a problem is it
 
04:18:05.150 --> 04:18:05.160 align:start position:0%
really and what what kinds of
 
04:18:05.160 --> 04:18:05.870 align:start position:0%
really and what what kinds of
um

04:18:05.870 --> 04:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:08.030 --> 04:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
penalties are people being threatened
 
04:18:08.040 --> 04:18:09.710 align:start position:0%
penalties are people being threatened
with

04:18:09.710 --> 04:18:09.720 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:18:12.650 --> 04:18:12.660 align:start position:0%
well it runs the gamut well kind of
 
04:18:14.090 --> 04:18:14.100 align:start position:0%
getting to the earlier question about
 
04:18:16.729 --> 04:18:16.739 align:start position:0%
size it the way the statute reads
 
04:18:19.309 --> 04:18:19.319 align:start position:0%
agriculture is agriculture is no size
 
04:18:22.309 --> 04:18:22.319 align:start position:0%
it's it's very small very large So you
 
04:18:25.010 --> 04:18:25.020 align:start position:0%
you're getting into that so and it's
 
04:18:25.020 --> 04:18:26.389 align:start position:0%
you're getting into that so and it's
um

04:18:26.389 --> 04:18:26.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:28.010 --> 04:18:28.020 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to think back at it like
 
04:18:32.210 --> 04:18:32.220 align:start position:0%
roosters is one example in in uh um the
 
04:18:34.189 --> 04:18:34.199 align:start position:0%
sponsor mentioned it was most recent
 
04:18:35.689 --> 04:18:35.699 align:start position:0%
incident that we dealt with was in
 
04:18:38.150 --> 04:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
Franconia and in that case the
 
04:18:40.189 --> 04:18:40.199 align:start position:0%
individual I mean she did she was did
 
04:18:41.929 --> 04:18:41.939 align:start position:0%
everything you'd expect when usually
 
04:18:43.309 --> 04:18:43.319 align:start position:0%
when I get members that call me with
 
04:18:45.110 --> 04:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
this I say you know have you are you
 
04:18:46.849 --> 04:18:46.859 align:start position:0%
trying to make accommodation you know
 
04:18:48.889 --> 04:18:48.899 align:start position:0%
are you just you know basically you're
 
04:18:50.150 --> 04:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
just ignoring it or are you trying to
 
04:18:51.830 --> 04:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
deal with it well this individual like
 
04:18:54.769 --> 04:18:54.779 align:start position:0%
she had insulated her poultry house she
 
04:18:56.990 --> 04:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
had put uh
 
04:19:00.710 --> 04:19:00.720 align:start position:0%
um shading over Windows uh she had even
 
04:19:02.510 --> 04:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
as a device you can purchase and put on
 
04:19:04.610 --> 04:19:04.620 align:start position:0%
a rooster that will muffle its sound she
 
04:19:06.889 --> 04:19:06.899 align:start position:0%
had done all that and it still was not
 
04:19:09.050 --> 04:19:09.060 align:start position:0%
in the satisfaction of her neighbor in
 
04:19:10.490 --> 04:19:10.500 align:start position:0%
her case her neighbor happened to be the
 
04:19:11.929 --> 04:19:11.939 align:start position:0%
Town Administrator from what I was told
 
04:19:14.929 --> 04:19:14.939 align:start position:0%
so then there was a town ordinance was
 
04:19:16.790 --> 04:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
developed and so that's a little unique
 
04:19:19.070 --> 04:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
circumstance there
 
04:19:21.410 --> 04:19:21.420 align:start position:0%
um and my understanding is the last I
 
04:19:23.630 --> 04:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
spoke to this individual they that was
 
04:19:26.090 --> 04:19:26.100 align:start position:0%
she was getting ready to go to court is
 
04:19:28.550 --> 04:19:28.560 align:start position:0%
that she planning on doing even though
 
04:19:30.710 --> 04:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
it was again we're not talking a
 
04:19:33.469 --> 04:19:33.479 align:start position:0%
commercial operation this was her so I I
 
04:19:34.790 --> 04:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
don't know if she went through with it
 
04:19:37.429 --> 04:19:37.439 align:start position:0%
after looking at everything
 
04:19:37.439 --> 04:19:38.030 align:start position:0%
after looking at everything
um

04:19:38.030 --> 04:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:40.790 --> 04:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
we had an incident in Dairy years ago
 
04:19:43.849 --> 04:19:43.859 align:start position:0%
where as a young lady raising chickens
 
04:19:46.809 --> 04:19:46.819 align:start position:0%
and it was like a kick out of it because
 
04:19:49.429 --> 04:19:49.439 align:start position:0%
she had a roosterone see any complaints
 
04:19:51.530 --> 04:19:51.540 align:start position:0%
and and I guess the city council had
 
04:19:53.389 --> 04:19:53.399 align:start position:0%
questioned her and this is a I say young
 
04:19:54.950 --> 04:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
lady she was eight or eight or nine
 
04:19:57.050 --> 04:19:57.060 align:start position:0%
years old and she wrote the cutest
 
04:19:58.429 --> 04:19:58.439 align:start position:0%
letter you'd ever read to the city
 
04:20:01.490 --> 04:20:01.500 align:start position:0%
council as to the need for a rooster in
 
04:20:04.429 --> 04:20:04.439 align:start position:0%
her the continuing of her operation and
 
04:20:08.030 --> 04:20:08.040 align:start position:0%
in that instance you know it was where
 
04:20:10.130 --> 04:20:10.140 align:start position:0%
that you have to get rid of the rooster
 
04:20:12.410 --> 04:20:12.420 align:start position:0%
in the end because I understood it
 
04:20:12.420 --> 04:20:14.389 align:start position:0%
in the end because I understood it
um

04:20:14.389 --> 04:20:14.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:16.189 --> 04:20:16.199 align:start position:0%
I mean that's something I guess I would
 
04:20:18.050 --> 04:20:18.060 align:start position:0%
you know getting a more concrete
 
04:20:20.269 --> 04:20:20.279 align:start position:0%
examples if if that were to help but
 
04:20:22.550 --> 04:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
certainly it's an issue where I I think
 
04:20:24.469 --> 04:20:24.479 align:start position:0%
a big part of it is in the end these
 
04:20:26.809 --> 04:20:26.819 align:start position:0%
issues are resolved I think most often
 
04:20:28.490 --> 04:20:28.500 align:start position:0%
before they go to court but it's the
 
04:20:31.250 --> 04:20:31.260 align:start position:0%
it's just the stress in Asia dealing
 
04:20:33.429 --> 04:20:33.439 align:start position:0%
with it for an extended period of time
 
04:20:36.170 --> 04:20:36.180 align:start position:0%
in the in the in the the threat I think
 
04:20:38.510 --> 04:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
all of us in agriculture when you have a
 
04:20:41.030 --> 04:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
farm and all of a sudden you know the
 
04:20:42.650 --> 04:20:42.660 align:start position:0%
the house is built over near the Back
 
04:20:44.450 --> 04:20:44.460 align:start position:0%
Forty you start to wonder am I going to
 
04:20:46.070 --> 04:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
be you know what issues are going to
 
04:20:49.250 --> 04:20:49.260 align:start position:0%
arise because they they do and most
 
04:20:52.370 --> 04:20:52.380 align:start position:0%
often I have found I farm myself and and
 
04:20:54.650 --> 04:20:54.660 align:start position:0%
most of my neighbors love the farm and
 
04:20:55.729 --> 04:20:55.739 align:start position:0%
they you know they want they're
 
04:20:57.229 --> 04:20:57.239 align:start position:0%
interested and want to be told about it
 
04:20:59.030 --> 04:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
and they want to feel a part of it and
 
04:21:00.410 --> 04:21:00.420 align:start position:0%
it's great
 
04:21:02.030 --> 04:21:02.040 align:start position:0%
um and I I'm fortunate to haven't had
 
04:21:04.189 --> 04:21:04.199 align:start position:0%
those but I know we we mentioned in the
 
04:21:07.490 --> 04:21:07.500 align:start position:0%
the previous hearing that the uh the uh
 
04:21:09.710 --> 04:21:09.720 align:start position:0%
farmer from Brookdale fruit farm and
 
04:21:12.469 --> 04:21:12.479 align:start position:0%
Hollis that requested the the uh
 
04:21:12.479 --> 04:21:15.050 align:start position:0%
Hollis that requested the the uh
legislation

04:21:15.050 --> 04:21:15.060 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
04:21:17.389 --> 04:21:17.399 align:start position:0%
um if I remember correctly Brookdale
 
04:21:21.050 --> 04:21:21.060 align:start position:0%
Fruit Farm has I believe this it's
 
04:21:24.769 --> 04:21:24.779 align:start position:0%
of 500 Butters something like that some
 
04:21:27.889 --> 04:21:27.899 align:start position:0%
crazy number so I mean it can be an
 
04:21:30.670 --> 04:21:30.680 align:start position:0%
awful uh it could be an awful lot of uh
 
04:21:33.889 --> 04:21:33.899 align:start position:0%
of people that that again just just may
 
04:21:35.990 --> 04:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
not understand the real needs and I I
 
04:21:38.450 --> 04:21:38.460 align:start position:0%
think part of this that we see it is
 
04:21:40.550 --> 04:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
geez if we get a little bit of a handle
 
04:21:42.429 --> 04:21:42.439 align:start position:0%
on this now
 
04:21:45.710 --> 04:21:45.720 align:start position:0%
as opposed to another 50 years but who
 
04:21:46.790 --> 04:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
knows what the state's going to look
 
04:21:48.469 --> 04:21:48.479 align:start position:0%
like trying to deal with it because you
 
04:21:50.330 --> 04:21:50.340 align:start position:0%
know I know in more urban States it's a
 
04:21:53.030 --> 04:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
it's a much bigger issue obviously
 
04:21:55.849 --> 04:21:55.859 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions from Mr
 
04:21:55.859 --> 04:21:58.429 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions from Mr
Johnson

04:21:58.429 --> 04:21:58.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:01.610 --> 04:22:01.620 align:start position:0%
Mr representative Bixby
 
04:22:05.210 --> 04:22:05.220 align:start position:0%
so I believe that um that we also have a
 
04:22:07.670 --> 04:22:07.680 align:start position:0%
right to farm statute somewhere in our
 
04:22:11.389 --> 04:22:11.399 align:start position:0%
in our rsas and does this play into this
 
04:22:15.469 --> 04:22:15.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:17.570 --> 04:22:17.580 align:start position:0%
well a right to farm that that that
 
04:22:21.349 --> 04:22:21.359 align:start position:0%
applies to operations that have been in
 
04:22:24.410 --> 04:22:24.420 align:start position:0%
existence for one year
 
04:22:24.420 --> 04:22:25.610 align:start position:0%
existence for one year
um

04:22:25.610 --> 04:22:25.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:28.490 --> 04:22:28.500 align:start position:0%
it it it it it does but again when
 
04:22:30.710 --> 04:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
you're getting into noise it can be so
 
04:22:33.830 --> 04:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
nebulous as to it again it's like odors
 
04:22:37.070 --> 04:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
as well everybody has a different idea
 
04:22:38.330 --> 04:22:38.340 align:start position:0%
of what is noisy and what's not what
 
04:22:40.610 --> 04:22:40.620 align:start position:0%
smells what doesn't that type of thing
 
04:22:43.189 --> 04:22:43.199 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah it's a good question I I
 
04:22:45.530 --> 04:22:45.540 align:start position:0%
feel I I should have brought that with
 
04:22:49.250 --> 04:22:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:51.050 --> 04:22:51.060 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
 
04:22:51.060 --> 04:22:59.689 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
Murray

04:22:59.689 --> 04:22:59.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:02.030 --> 04:23:02.040 align:start position:0%
on the right to farm statutes how that
 
04:23:04.849 --> 04:23:04.859 align:start position:0%
intersects to the committee
 
04:23:06.410 --> 04:23:06.420 align:start position:0%
certainly it's it's
 
04:23:06.420 --> 04:23:07.370 align:start position:0%
certainly it's it's
um

04:23:07.370 --> 04:23:07.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:10.849 --> 04:23:10.859 align:start position:0%
I want to say it's 435 I believe and I
 
04:23:12.830 --> 04:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
everybody yeah
 
04:23:17.990 --> 04:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:20.990 --> 04:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
okay 435
 
04:23:22.849 --> 04:23:22.859 align:start position:0%
I can actually yeah I can tell you in a
 
04:23:25.849 --> 04:23:25.859 align:start position:0%
minute exactly the statute of it in my
 
04:23:27.469 --> 04:23:27.479 align:start position:0%
with my things
 
04:24:04.250 --> 04:24:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:06.830 --> 04:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
I could certainly get it too
 
04:24:06.840 --> 04:24:13.309 align:start position:0%
I could certainly get it too
okay

04:24:13.309 --> 04:24:13.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:15.710 --> 04:24:15.720 align:start position:0%
all right then any other questions I
 
04:24:17.990 --> 04:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
don't see any other pink cards for this
 
04:24:18.000 --> 04:24:19.250 align:start position:0%
don't see any other pink cards for this
uh

04:24:19.250 --> 04:24:19.260 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:24:19.260 --> 04:24:20.870 align:start position:0%
uh

04:24:20.870 --> 04:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:24:32.090 --> 04:24:32.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:37.370 --> 04:24:37.380 align:start position:0%
432 432 colon 32-35 and just for your
 
04:24:39.530 --> 04:24:39.540 align:start position:0%
information that it you won't find Right
 
04:24:42.290 --> 04:24:42.300 align:start position:0%
to Farm it's called nuisance liability
 
04:24:44.630 --> 04:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
of agricultural operations that's how to
 
04:24:49.910 --> 04:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:49.920 --> 04:24:54.710 align:start position:0%
 
32

04:24:54.710 --> 04:24:54.720 align:start position:0%

04:25:08.990 --> 04:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
just for the record if I may you did say
 
04:25:11.269 --> 04:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
it was nuisance liability
 
04:25:19.189 --> 04:25:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:25.130 --> 04:25:25.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:25.140 --> 04:25:32.870 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:25:32.870 --> 04:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:35.150 --> 04:25:35.160 align:start position:0%
there's barbs
 
04:25:36.469 --> 04:25:36.479 align:start position:0%
all right then
 
04:25:39.710 --> 04:25:39.720 align:start position:0%
um so for HB 252 the blue sheet we've
 
04:25:44.149 --> 04:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
got one pro uh for the bill and then
 
04:25:47.090 --> 04:25:47.100 align:start position:0%
online we've got five that support and
 
04:25:49.010 --> 04:25:49.020 align:start position:0%
one in opposition
 
04:25:51.170 --> 04:25:51.180 align:start position:0%
and with that I'm going to close the
 
04:25:55.670 --> 04:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:55.680 --> 04:26:01.130 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:26:01.130 --> 04:26:01.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:03.649 --> 04:26:03.659 align:start position:0%
guess what I'd like to do
 
04:26:06.710 --> 04:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
is get a sense from the committee for
 
04:26:09.769 --> 04:26:09.779 align:start position:0%
the bills that we've heard today
 
04:26:09.779 --> 04:26:11.689 align:start position:0%
the bills that we've heard today
if

04:26:11.689 --> 04:26:11.699 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:26:15.229 --> 04:26:15.239 align:start position:0%
I know well next week we've got
 
04:26:18.469 --> 04:26:18.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:21.950 --> 04:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:23.750 --> 04:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
we've got three bills that we're going
 
04:26:27.590 --> 04:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:27.600 --> 04:26:31.130 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:26:31.130 --> 04:26:31.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:33.469 --> 04:26:33.479 align:start position:0%
um well we can talk about that I guess
 
04:26:38.269 --> 04:26:38.279 align:start position:0%
but I know what we had was HB 300
 
04:26:41.290 --> 04:26:41.300 align:start position:0%
for next week's hearing
 
04:26:48.110 --> 04:26:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:52.610 --> 04:26:52.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:52.620 --> 04:26:54.250 align:start position:0%
 
for

04:26:54.250 --> 04:26:54.260 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:26:56.450 --> 04:26:56.460 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
04:26:59.030 --> 04:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
for a 10 o'clock and at 10 o'clock we're
 
04:27:02.210 --> 04:27:02.220 align:start position:0%
on the hearing uh for Tuesday
 
04:27:04.610 --> 04:27:04.620 align:start position:0%
January 24th we had a 10 o'clock
 
04:27:07.910 --> 04:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
starting at 10 o'clock at HB 300 and
 
04:27:10.790 --> 04:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
then there's a companion bill to that of
 
04:27:10.800 --> 04:27:12.110 align:start position:0%
then there's a companion bill to that of
funding

04:27:12.110 --> 04:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
funding
 
04:27:17.090 --> 04:27:17.100 align:start position:0%
uh appropriation for that for uh HB 462
 
04:27:19.429 --> 04:27:19.439 align:start position:0%
so we figured we could do those two
 
04:27:19.439 --> 04:27:20.510 align:start position:0%
so we figured we could do those two
together

04:27:20.510 --> 04:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
together
 
04:27:22.790 --> 04:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
and then in the afternoon
 
04:27:25.910 --> 04:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
we would have HB 326 which is the
 
04:27:29.570 --> 04:27:29.580 align:start position:0%
rodenticide bill
 
04:27:29.580 --> 04:27:32.210 align:start position:0%
rodenticide bill
um

04:27:32.210 --> 04:27:32.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:35.210 --> 04:27:35.220 align:start position:0%
I don't I I want to get a sense from the
 
04:27:38.090 --> 04:27:38.100 align:start position:0%
committee if we should have an exec
 
04:27:41.330 --> 04:27:41.340 align:start position:0%
session after that rodenticide bill so
 
04:27:41.340 --> 04:27:42.290 align:start position:0%
session after that rodenticide bill so
that

04:27:42.290 --> 04:27:42.300 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:27:44.090 --> 04:27:44.100 align:start position:0%
um for some of the bills that we heard
 
04:27:44.100 --> 04:27:55.210 align:start position:0%
um for some of the bills that we heard
today

04:27:55.210 --> 04:27:55.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:58.189 --> 04:27:58.199 align:start position:0%
can I have your
 
04:28:00.170 --> 04:28:00.180 align:start position:0%
can't hear you
 
04:28:00.180 --> 04:28:03.710 align:start position:0%
can't hear you
um I'm

04:28:03.710 --> 04:28:03.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:06.649 --> 04:28:06.659 align:start position:0%
I guess the my only concern is I have no
 
04:28:08.630 --> 04:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
idea how long the rodenticide bill was
 
04:28:10.490 --> 04:28:10.500 align:start position:0%
going to take I could imagine that
 
04:28:14.090 --> 04:28:14.100 align:start position:0%
taking a half an hour or three hours
 
04:28:16.130 --> 04:28:16.140 align:start position:0%
maybe not three hours did you get in
 
04:28:17.929 --> 04:28:17.939 align:start position:0%
touch with representative cannon at all
 
04:28:19.729 --> 04:28:19.739 align:start position:0%
yes she said and she said there were
 
04:28:21.229 --> 04:28:21.239 align:start position:0%
there were several
 
04:28:21.239 --> 04:28:22.010 align:start position:0%
there were several
um

04:28:22.010 --> 04:28:22.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:24.889 --> 04:28:24.899 align:start position:0%
several organizations that uh had
 
04:28:26.450 --> 04:28:26.460 align:start position:0%
interest in that
 
04:28:29.510 --> 04:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
um uh so
 
04:28:32.870 --> 04:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
um I think the not remembering which one
 
04:28:36.349 --> 04:28:36.359 align:start position:0%
specifically but perhaps Audubon and uh
 
04:28:39.530 --> 04:28:39.540 align:start position:0%
the uh the folks who do
 
04:28:42.530 --> 04:28:42.540 align:start position:0%
um Raptor
 
04:28:48.410 --> 04:28:48.420 align:start position:0%
uh rescue and a couple of other
 
04:28:51.590 --> 04:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
environmental organizations I think so I
 
04:28:54.649 --> 04:28:54.659 align:start position:0%
but uh so I'm not sh but I haven't seen
 
04:28:57.590 --> 04:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
any I haven't seen a whole lot of
 
04:28:57.600 --> 04:28:59.389 align:start position:0%
any I haven't seen a whole lot of
um

04:28:59.389 --> 04:28:59.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:02.210 --> 04:29:02.220 align:start position:0%
emails coming in about that so I'm not
 
04:29:03.830 --> 04:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
sure if it's you know sometimes that's
 
04:29:05.389 --> 04:29:05.399 align:start position:0%
one way to gauge whether something is
 
04:29:07.969 --> 04:29:07.979 align:start position:0%
going to be right busy
 
04:29:07.979 --> 04:29:08.809 align:start position:0%
going to be right busy
um

04:29:08.809 --> 04:29:08.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:12.950 --> 04:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
so uh what I'm and the reason I the I
 
04:29:15.229 --> 04:29:15.239 align:start position:0%
guess my concern is I don't
 
04:29:19.729 --> 04:29:19.739 align:start position:0%
I'm not I for scheduling exec sessions
 
04:29:23.030 --> 04:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
I'd like it to be in such a way that we
 
04:29:24.649 --> 04:29:24.659 align:start position:0%
can be kind of predictable about when
 
04:29:26.149 --> 04:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
they're going to be happening as opposed
 
04:29:27.710 --> 04:29:27.720 align:start position:0%
to this might happen somewhere between
 
04:29:31.070 --> 04:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
two o'clock and right uh and I don't
 
04:29:35.090 --> 04:29:35.100 align:start position:0%
think that uh any of the bills
 
04:29:38.210 --> 04:29:38.220 align:start position:0%
that we're going to be exacting are
 
04:29:40.429 --> 04:29:40.439 align:start position:0%
uh sufficiently
 
04:29:42.110 --> 04:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
urgent that we it makes any difference
 
04:29:45.410 --> 04:29:45.420 align:start position:0%
and I think and they're most of them are
 
04:29:47.090 --> 04:29:47.100 align:start position:0%
not actually particularly tricky either
 
04:29:47.100 --> 04:29:48.290 align:start position:0%
not actually particularly tricky either
right

04:29:48.290 --> 04:29:48.300 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:29:50.870 --> 04:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
so um
 
04:29:53.870 --> 04:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
so I think that uh it might make sense
 
04:29:57.769 --> 04:29:57.779 align:start position:0%
to do the exact session for all of the
 
04:30:02.450 --> 04:30:02.460 align:start position:0%
bills that we did today on the 30th uh
 
04:30:04.729 --> 04:30:04.739 align:start position:0%
and unless there's something that needs
 
04:30:04.739 --> 04:30:05.510 align:start position:0%
and unless there's something that needs
a

04:30:05.510 --> 04:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:30:08.510 --> 04:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
uh the only one I might say might take
 
04:30:11.330 --> 04:30:11.340 align:start position:0%
longer would be the 369 if we want to
 
04:30:13.490 --> 04:30:13.500 align:start position:0%
try to
 
04:30:15.590 --> 04:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
um rewrite that I think that might need
 
04:30:18.229 --> 04:30:18.239 align:start position:0%
to go to a study committee
 
04:30:20.809 --> 04:30:20.819 align:start position:0%
and then I think that we might also
 
04:30:23.210 --> 04:30:23.220 align:start position:0%
leave space on the 30th for executing
 
04:30:25.130 --> 04:30:25.140 align:start position:0%
the bills we're hearing next week
 
04:30:29.149 --> 04:30:29.159 align:start position:0%
can you mean the 31st the 31st yeah yeah
 
04:30:31.189 --> 04:30:31.199 align:start position:0%
my calendar my head the calendar in my
 
04:30:34.010 --> 04:30:34.020 align:start position:0%
head is kind of vague okay
 
04:30:37.250 --> 04:30:37.260 align:start position:0%
um all right that seems reasonable
 
04:30:40.790 --> 04:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
and uh so I think we can uh
 
04:30:42.710 --> 04:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
we can look to
 
04:30:45.830 --> 04:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
uh setting an exec session for the 31st
 
04:30:48.349 --> 04:30:48.359 align:start position:0%
on the bills that we've heard yeah some
 
04:30:49.250 --> 04:30:49.260 align:start position:0%
of the bills that we've heard
 
04:30:49.260 --> 04:30:50.830 align:start position:0%
of the bills that we've heard
representative

04:30:50.830 --> 04:30:50.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:30:53.809 --> 04:30:53.819 align:start position:0%
oh second that Madam chair okay
 
04:30:53.819 --> 04:30:54.950 align:start position:0%
oh second that Madam chair okay
good

04:30:54.950 --> 04:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
good
 
04:30:58.130 --> 04:30:58.140 align:start position:0%
anyone else yes yeah man one comment on
 
04:31:02.149 --> 04:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
it seemed to me that HB 79
 
04:31:02.159 --> 04:31:03.769 align:start position:0%
it seemed to me that HB 79
um

04:31:03.769 --> 04:31:03.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:07.550 --> 04:31:07.560 align:start position:0%
was a little bit behind executing but I
 
04:31:08.870 --> 04:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
don't know if we want to look at that or
 
04:31:10.729 --> 04:31:10.739 align:start position:0%
not okay so
 
04:31:13.910 --> 04:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
um my my thought on that is that
 
04:31:16.550 --> 04:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
um it probably makes sense to turn that
 
04:31:21.170 --> 04:31:21.180 align:start position:0%
into a study committee and uh and I've
 
04:31:23.269 --> 04:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
got a I talked with a commissioner about
 
04:31:24.889 --> 04:31:24.899 align:start position:0%
that in terms of getting us some
 
04:31:27.229 --> 04:31:27.239 align:start position:0%
language about what what would make most
 
04:31:30.410 --> 04:31:30.420 align:start position:0%
sense to study in terms of the chapters
 
04:31:34.610 --> 04:31:34.620 align:start position:0%
that uh that and and some and questions
 
04:31:36.710 --> 04:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
that would sort of focus our work a
 
04:31:39.769 --> 04:31:39.779 align:start position:0%
little bit and uh he said that he would
 
04:31:43.130 --> 04:31:43.140 align:start position:0%
be able to get that uh get that that
 
04:31:46.610 --> 04:31:46.620 align:start position:0%
suggested language to to us on not this
 
04:31:48.229 --> 04:31:48.239 align:start position:0%
coming week but the next week so that
 
04:31:50.510 --> 04:31:50.520 align:start position:0%
would make it I I'd be I'd be able to
 
04:31:52.130 --> 04:31:52.140 align:start position:0%
write an amendment for that before the
 
04:31:52.140 --> 04:31:58.729 align:start position:0%
write an amendment for that before the
31st

04:31:58.729 --> 04:31:58.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:01.429 --> 04:32:01.439 align:start position:0%
Madam chair yes I'm sorry go ahead no
 
04:32:02.689 --> 04:32:02.699 align:start position:0%
that's okay thank you for taking my
 
04:32:04.250 --> 04:32:04.260 align:start position:0%
question what what time were you
 
04:32:06.110 --> 04:32:06.120 align:start position:0%
proposing for the exact session on the
 
04:32:06.120 --> 04:32:07.550 align:start position:0%
proposing for the exact session on the
31st

04:32:07.550 --> 04:32:07.560 align:start position:0%
31st
 
04:32:10.429 --> 04:32:10.439 align:start position:0%
I think we would start that at 10. okay
 
04:32:14.750 --> 04:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:14.760 --> 04:32:15.410 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:32:15.410 --> 04:32:15.420 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:32:17.990 --> 04:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
um I'm just looking to see which ones
 
04:32:20.870 --> 04:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
are the bills that we saw we heard today
 
04:32:23.570 --> 04:32:23.580 align:start position:0%
were early bills
 
04:32:28.670 --> 04:32:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:32.990 --> 04:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
which was the seed bill yeah yeah okay
 
04:32:33.000 --> 04:32:34.790 align:start position:0%
which was the seed bill yeah yeah okay
okay

04:32:34.790 --> 04:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:32:34.800 --> 04:32:39.229 align:start position:0%
okay
um

04:32:39.229 --> 04:32:39.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:43.929 --> 04:32:43.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:48.290 --> 04:32:48.300 align:start position:0%
yeah so the 300 and 326 next week's
 
04:32:51.950 --> 04:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
those are early bills also right and we
 
04:32:53.269 --> 04:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
04:32:54.710 --> 04:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
um I'm
 
04:32:56.750 --> 04:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
don't remember what the number of it is
 
04:33:01.670 --> 04:33:01.680 align:start position:0%
but it's my bill on uh the dedicated
 
04:33:04.010 --> 04:33:04.020 align:start position:0%
making this
 
04:33:04.020 --> 04:33:06.949 align:start position:0%
making this
um

04:33:06.949 --> 04:33:06.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:10.369 --> 04:33:10.379 align:start position:0%
the soil stop going to it
 
04:33:10.379 --> 04:33:12.230 align:start position:0%
the soil stop going to it
um

04:33:12.230 --> 04:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:14.810 --> 04:33:14.820 align:start position:0%
all right so did we do we actually have
 
04:33:17.390 --> 04:33:17.400 align:start position:0%
that in our folder yet
 
04:33:17.400 --> 04:33:19.670 align:start position:0%
that in our folder yet
um

04:33:19.670 --> 04:33:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:23.449 --> 04:33:23.459 align:start position:0%
the bill for its
 
04:33:25.131 --> 04:33:25.141 align:start position:0%
um it was one that was it was one of the
 
04:33:27.470 --> 04:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
ones that was just sent out recently
 
04:33:27.480 --> 04:33:28.189 align:start position:0%
ones that was just sent out recently
um

04:33:28.189 --> 04:33:28.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:28.199 --> 04:33:35.709 align:start position:0%
um
foreign

04:33:35.709 --> 04:33:35.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:37.970 --> 04:33:37.980 align:start position:0%
that is
 
04:33:40.070 --> 04:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
um changing where the
 
04:33:43.070 --> 04:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
um Planet soil additive uh
 
04:33:45.890 --> 04:33:45.900 align:start position:0%
fees go yeah that's 494 and that's an
 
04:33:47.631 --> 04:33:47.641 align:start position:0%
early bill as well yeah so that's an
 
04:33:49.849 --> 04:33:49.859 align:start position:0%
early bill I don't think it's going to
 
04:33:51.830 --> 04:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
be hugely complicated we might want to
 
04:33:55.010 --> 04:33:55.020 align:start position:0%
hear that after the rodenticides
 
04:33:57.590 --> 04:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
um and if we
 
04:33:59.810 --> 04:33:59.820 align:start position:0%
if we if we schedule the rodenticides
 
04:34:02.390 --> 04:34:02.400 align:start position:0%
for an hour and that's probably enough
 
04:34:05.510 --> 04:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
and then I don't think it'll take more
 
04:34:07.730 --> 04:34:07.740 align:start position:0%
than a half an hour to do the
 
04:34:07.740 --> 04:34:08.570 align:start position:0%
than a half an hour to do the
um

04:34:08.570 --> 04:34:08.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:08.580 --> 04:34:10.131 align:start position:0%
um
unless

04:34:10.131 --> 04:34:10.141 align:start position:0%
unless
 
04:34:11.810 --> 04:34:11.820 align:start position:0%
do you imagine anyone's going to come
 
04:34:13.551 --> 04:34:13.561 align:start position:0%
out of the woodworker posing that oh
 
04:34:17.029 --> 04:34:17.039 align:start position:0%
what do it inside no the um the uh
 
04:34:20.209 --> 04:34:20.219 align:start position:0%
changing moving the fund right uh for
 
04:34:22.551 --> 04:34:22.561 align:start position:0%
fertilizers from the general funds to a
 
04:34:26.449 --> 04:34:26.459 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund I have no idea okay
 
04:34:26.459 --> 04:34:27.170 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund I have no idea okay
um

04:34:27.170 --> 04:34:27.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:31.010 --> 04:34:31.020 align:start position:0%
so do you wanna you wanna add that um HB
 
04:34:35.949 --> 04:34:35.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:38.810 --> 04:34:38.820 align:start position:0%
are at one and then we could do that one
 
04:34:41.510 --> 04:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
perhaps at two and if it we need to push
 
04:34:43.010 --> 04:34:43.020 align:start position:0%
it back a little if it would then it's
 
04:34:45.769 --> 04:34:45.779 align:start position:0%
either blow up we can push it back like
 
04:34:48.051 --> 04:34:48.061 align:start position:0%
half an hour or something well we well
 
04:34:49.789 --> 04:34:49.799 align:start position:0%
you want to schedule that for two or two
 
04:34:49.799 --> 04:34:50.869 align:start position:0%
you want to schedule that for two or two
thirty

04:34:50.869 --> 04:34:50.879 align:start position:0%
thirty
 
04:34:54.410 --> 04:34:54.420 align:start position:0%
um two okay 2 30 2 30. okay so I'll do
 
04:34:56.390 --> 04:34:56.400 align:start position:0%
that let me you could put that one ahead
 
04:34:58.670 --> 04:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
of it inside and put it inside actually
 
04:35:01.429 --> 04:35:01.439 align:start position:0%
maybe we could yeah so make this at one
 
04:35:04.250 --> 04:35:04.260 align:start position:0%
because yeah let's put the
 
04:35:07.429 --> 04:35:07.439 align:start position:0%
put 494 at one and then rodenticides at
 
04:35:09.910 --> 04:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
1 30.
 
04:35:13.429 --> 04:35:13.439 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm here okay so I will make
 
04:35:15.349 --> 04:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
I'll make that change with Heather yeah
 
04:35:18.109 --> 04:35:18.119 align:start position:0%
and we'll have four bills next week
 
04:35:20.510 --> 04:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
and then uh the subsequent week on the
 
04:35:23.390 --> 04:35:23.400 align:start position:0%
31st we'll we'll do uh some an exact
 
04:35:25.730 --> 04:35:25.740 align:start position:0%
session in the morning right
 
04:35:27.830 --> 04:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
um from 10 to 12 you think that would be
 
04:35:29.449 --> 04:35:29.459 align:start position:0%
sufficient yeah that should be that
 
04:35:31.250 --> 04:35:31.260 align:start position:0%
should be sufficient okay and then we
 
04:35:33.890 --> 04:35:33.900 align:start position:0%
can we'll talk further about scheduling
 
04:35:35.390 --> 04:35:35.400 align:start position:0%
some other bills in the afternoon for
 
04:35:38.631 --> 04:35:38.641 align:start position:0%
hearing that makes all right
 
04:35:42.709 --> 04:35:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:44.929 --> 04:35:44.939 align:start position:0%
oh okay
 
04:35:46.429 --> 04:35:46.439 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:35:46.439 --> 04:35:47.631 align:start position:0%
all right
um

04:35:47.631 --> 04:35:47.641 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:50.330 --> 04:35:50.340 align:start position:0%
so with that okay do we want to get a
 
04:35:52.670 --> 04:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
sense of where people are yeah why don't
 
04:35:55.551 --> 04:35:55.561 align:start position:0%
we why don't we open that up okay I kind
 
04:35:58.010 --> 04:35:58.020 align:start position:0%
of want to get a sense from everybody
 
04:36:00.230 --> 04:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
um regarding the hearings today what
 
04:36:03.410 --> 04:36:03.420 align:start position:0%
your thoughts are uh
 
04:36:05.449 --> 04:36:05.459 align:start position:0%
so why don't I start with you
 
04:36:08.750 --> 04:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby okay so um
 
04:36:10.970 --> 04:36:10.980 align:start position:0%
um we should probably go through bill by
 
04:36:13.369 --> 04:36:13.379 align:start position:0%
Bill but I don't I'm forgetting the all
 
04:36:15.890 --> 04:36:15.900 align:start position:0%
right the title so when we start with HB
 
04:36:17.810 --> 04:36:17.820 align:start position:0%
221 okay
 
04:36:21.529 --> 04:36:21.539 align:start position:0%
okay relative to the acquisition of uh
 
04:36:24.109 --> 04:36:24.119 align:start position:0%
agricultural land development rights uh
 
04:36:25.670 --> 04:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
anybody have any thoughts on that
 
04:36:27.230 --> 04:36:27.240 align:start position:0%
particular bill
 
04:36:29.150 --> 04:36:29.160 align:start position:0%
representative NAB
 
04:36:30.470 --> 04:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
um just having worked on many
 
04:36:32.990 --> 04:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
conservation projects in our town and I
 
04:36:35.390 --> 04:36:35.400 align:start position:0%
am very supportive of it land trusts are
 
04:36:37.189 --> 04:36:37.199 align:start position:0%
often really useful at writing easements
 
04:36:38.631 --> 04:36:38.641 align:start position:0%
and holding easements and monitoring
 
04:36:42.051 --> 04:36:42.061 align:start position:0%
properties and the state is less so so I
 
04:36:43.631 --> 04:36:43.641 align:start position:0%
think that flexibility is really
 
04:36:46.490 --> 04:36:46.500 align:start position:0%
important and I fully support it
 
04:36:46.500 --> 04:36:56.810 align:start position:0%
important and I fully support it
foreign

04:36:56.810 --> 04:36:56.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:58.551 --> 04:36:58.561 align:start position:0%
all right anybody have any major
 
04:37:02.269 --> 04:37:02.279 align:start position:0%
disagreements with that bill
 
04:37:02.279 --> 04:37:03.590 align:start position:0%
disagreements with that bill
no

04:37:03.590 --> 04:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:37:03.600 --> 04:37:06.590 align:start position:0%
no
okay

04:37:06.590 --> 04:37:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:09.349 --> 04:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
um looks like that would be a an OTP
 
04:37:11.209 --> 04:37:11.219 align:start position:0%
from this committee
 
04:37:13.570 --> 04:37:13.580 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:37:16.010 --> 04:37:16.020 align:start position:0%
hb138 relative to the oversight of
 
04:37:17.390 --> 04:37:17.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Department of
 
04:37:19.551 --> 04:37:19.561 align:start position:0%
Agriculture markets and food
 
04:37:22.070 --> 04:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
anybody have any
 
04:37:29.209 --> 04:37:29.219 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:29.219 --> 04:37:31.490 align:start position:0%
 
no

04:37:31.490 --> 04:37:31.500 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:37:31.500 --> 04:37:35.090 align:start position:0%
no
okay

04:37:35.090 --> 04:37:35.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:38.449 --> 04:37:38.459 align:start position:0%
uh hb152 relative to soil and plant
 
04:37:38.459 --> 04:37:41.750 align:start position:0%
uh hb152 relative to soil and plant
additives

04:37:41.750 --> 04:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:44.330 --> 04:37:44.340 align:start position:0%
go ahead thank you madam chair
 
04:37:47.689 --> 04:37:47.699 align:start position:0%
um over this summer or the fall we work
 
04:37:50.869 --> 04:37:50.879 align:start position:0%
diligently on that particular chapter
 
04:37:54.230 --> 04:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
and really did the Deep dive and I think
 
04:37:56.090 --> 04:37:56.100 align:start position:0%
that representative Bixby did a great
 
04:38:00.369 --> 04:38:00.379 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:03.369 --> 04:38:03.379 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:38:06.890 --> 04:38:06.900 align:start position:0%
okay I have no problem with that at all
 
04:38:09.890 --> 04:38:09.900 align:start position:0%
I think I think you again you guys did a
 
04:38:12.890 --> 04:38:12.900 align:start position:0%
very thorough uh Deep dive into that one
 
04:38:15.769 --> 04:38:15.779 align:start position:0%
and it shows it's very very well put
 
04:38:19.609 --> 04:38:19.619 align:start position:0%
together anybody else have comments
 
04:38:22.730 --> 04:38:22.740 align:start position:0%
uh okay HB 79 relative to the authority
 
04:38:24.051 --> 04:38:24.061 align:start position:0%
of the commissioner of the Department of
 
04:38:26.090 --> 04:38:26.100 align:start position:0%
Agriculture markets and food to inspect
 
04:38:26.100 --> 04:38:27.289 align:start position:0%
Agriculture markets and food to inspect
apples

04:38:27.289 --> 04:38:27.299 align:start position:0%
apples
 
04:38:30.051 --> 04:38:30.061 align:start position:0%
so I know that representative Ankerberg
 
04:38:32.090 --> 04:38:32.100 align:start position:0%
brought a
 
04:38:34.551 --> 04:38:34.561 align:start position:0%
an amendment to that
 
04:38:40.429 --> 04:38:40.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:43.789 --> 04:38:43.799 align:start position:0%
to to restrict it further down I make it
 
04:38:45.410 --> 04:38:45.420 align:start position:0%
into a study committee we talked about
 
04:38:49.010 --> 04:38:49.020 align:start position:0%
that and probably trying to turn this
 
04:38:51.910 --> 04:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
into a study committee that looks to
 
04:38:59.330 --> 04:38:59.340 align:start position:0%
coordinate uh 426 RSA 426 and 434.
 
04:39:01.070 --> 04:39:01.080 align:start position:0%
what's your thoughts representative
 
04:39:04.189 --> 04:39:04.199 align:start position:0%
Contour thank you madam chair
 
04:39:05.750 --> 04:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
um I think that a study committee would
 
04:39:08.029 --> 04:39:08.039 align:start position:0%
be the way to go because obviously where
 
04:39:09.890 --> 04:39:09.900 align:start position:0%
there's one duplication there are others
 
04:39:13.429 --> 04:39:13.439 align:start position:0%
and I think it's uh to take a look at
 
04:39:15.109 --> 04:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
the statutes and find out where the
 
04:39:16.970 --> 04:39:16.980 align:start position:0%
duplicates are and to make things more
 
04:39:19.010 --> 04:39:19.020 align:start position:0%
streamlined would be the way to go
 
04:39:21.170 --> 04:39:21.180 align:start position:0%
okay any other comments representative
 
04:39:23.510 --> 04:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
Murray uh yes thank you madam chair I
 
04:39:24.949 --> 04:39:24.959 align:start position:0%
also think that there may there may be
 
04:39:26.750 --> 04:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
instances in where there need to be
 
04:39:28.369 --> 04:39:28.379 align:start position:0%
other stakeholders who provide some
 
04:39:30.949 --> 04:39:30.959 align:start position:0%
additional insights so the study
 
04:39:33.470 --> 04:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
committee is pragmatic I think it makes
 
04:39:33.480 --> 04:39:35.390 align:start position:0%
committee is pragmatic I think it makes
sense

04:39:35.390 --> 04:39:35.400 align:start position:0%
sense
 
04:39:37.189 --> 04:39:37.199 align:start position:0%
anyone else have any comments
 
04:39:39.708 --> 04:39:39.718 align:start position:0%
representative Potenza
 
04:39:42.890 --> 04:39:42.900 align:start position:0%
I agree I think the study committee is a
 
04:39:45.350 --> 04:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
great idea it seems as if everybody was
 
04:39:47.390 --> 04:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
in agreement um that was even testifying
 
04:39:50.150 --> 04:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
my question is does the
 
04:39:52.610 --> 04:39:52.620 align:start position:0%
does the sponsor of the bill have to put
 
04:39:54.590 --> 04:39:54.600 align:start position:0%
in an amendment for that does the does
 
04:39:56.150 --> 04:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
this Committee just decide if it's going
 
04:39:57.590 --> 04:39:57.600 align:start position:0%
to move to a study committee can you
 
04:39:59.150 --> 04:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
tell me just a little bit about that
 
04:40:01.190 --> 04:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
process well the committee is now in
 
04:40:03.050 --> 04:40:03.060 align:start position:0%
possession of this bill so we can do
 
04:40:06.170 --> 04:40:06.180 align:start position:0%
with it as we desire
 
04:40:08.868 --> 04:40:08.878 align:start position:0%
um and I believe representative Bixby
 
04:40:11.090 --> 04:40:11.100 align:start position:0%
was going to look at uh putting an
 
04:40:14.150 --> 04:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
amendment together yes so um and just in
 
04:40:15.708 --> 04:40:15.718 align:start position:0%
terms of process
 
04:40:18.708 --> 04:40:18.718 align:start position:0%
um just to amplify what the chairperson
 
04:40:21.070 --> 04:40:21.080 align:start position:0%
said uh
 
04:40:23.810 --> 04:40:23.820 align:start position:0%
once a bill comes to a committee the
 
04:40:26.690 --> 04:40:26.700 align:start position:0%
committee is basically determines what's
 
04:40:28.368 --> 04:40:28.378 align:start position:0%
going to happen with it they may or may
 
04:40:30.530 --> 04:40:30.540 align:start position:0%
not consult the the sponsor but the
 
04:40:33.050 --> 04:40:33.060 align:start position:0%
sponsor is kind of out of the loop uh
 
04:40:33.060 --> 04:40:34.610 align:start position:0%
sponsor is kind of out of the loop uh
and

04:40:34.610 --> 04:40:34.620 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:40:38.270 --> 04:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
um and for this particular Bill uh I
 
04:40:41.510 --> 04:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
think that it's pretty clear that it we
 
04:40:43.190 --> 04:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
going with a study committee makes sense
 
04:40:44.990 --> 04:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
and we're going to get advice from the
 
04:40:47.110 --> 04:40:47.120 align:start position:0%
Department from the commissioner about
 
04:40:51.230 --> 04:40:51.240 align:start position:0%
uh how to look at those chapters of law
 
04:40:53.030 --> 04:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
because that chapter or those chapters
 
04:40:55.970 --> 04:40:55.980 align:start position:0%
because they're familiar with dealing
 
04:40:57.948 --> 04:40:57.958 align:start position:0%
with the regulation of them and they
 
04:41:00.948 --> 04:41:00.958 align:start position:0%
know what they do and don't uh you pay a
 
04:41:03.410 --> 04:41:03.420 align:start position:0%
lot of attention to
 
04:41:05.810 --> 04:41:05.820 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up yeah sure so
 
04:41:09.288 --> 04:41:09.298 align:start position:0%
representative so on the 31st we let's
 
04:41:11.150 --> 04:41:11.160 align:start position:0%
say that moves further it goes to study
 
04:41:12.590 --> 04:41:12.600 align:start position:0%
committee then
 
04:41:14.930 --> 04:41:14.940 align:start position:0%
um that would possibly then go when it
 
04:41:16.788 --> 04:41:16.798 align:start position:0%
goes to session go on like a consent
 
04:41:21.110 --> 04:41:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:25.010 --> 04:41:25.020 align:start position:0%
um yes so uh if we vote unanimously in
 
04:41:27.350 --> 04:41:27.360 align:start position:0%
terms of uh converting that to a study
 
04:41:28.910 --> 04:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
committee with an amendment then it
 
04:41:31.128 --> 04:41:31.138 align:start position:0%
would we would probably put on the
 
04:41:33.230 --> 04:41:33.240 align:start position:0%
consent calendar and then it would go
 
04:41:37.670 --> 04:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
over the Senate and then the Senate will
 
04:41:41.270 --> 04:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
um we will make we will make our uh our
 
04:41:43.490 --> 04:41:43.500 align:start position:0%
argument to the Senate to do it and they
 
04:41:45.350 --> 04:41:45.360 align:start position:0%
probably will be fine with it
 
04:41:49.190 --> 04:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
so okay representative Howard
 
04:41:51.050 --> 04:41:51.060 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman
 
04:41:52.910 --> 04:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
um I guess I have a question about uh
 
04:41:55.850 --> 04:41:55.860 align:start position:0%
whether or not it would the study would
 
04:41:58.610 --> 04:41:58.620 align:start position:0%
be limited to just that portion of the
 
04:42:01.368 --> 04:42:01.378 align:start position:0%
set of rules or if we could expand it to
 
04:42:05.208 --> 04:42:05.218 align:start position:0%
to address other redundancies in the
 
04:42:07.430 --> 04:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
in in the set of rules that the
 
04:42:09.050 --> 04:42:09.060 align:start position:0%
commissioner was talking about I think
 
04:42:10.570 --> 04:42:10.580 align:start position:0%
it was phism
 
04:42:12.770 --> 04:42:12.780 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
04:42:15.590 --> 04:42:15.600 align:start position:0%
um just in terms of practicality
 
04:42:19.190 --> 04:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
um studying one chapter is about as much
 
04:42:21.650 --> 04:42:21.660 align:start position:0%
as as a study committee can handle and
 
04:42:25.070 --> 04:42:25.080 align:start position:0%
one could sort of go with the ideal of
 
04:42:27.770 --> 04:42:27.780 align:start position:0%
like looking at the entire rsas and
 
04:42:31.190 --> 04:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
looking for problems but that's that's a
 
04:42:34.190 --> 04:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
doomed Enterprise so you need to sort of
 
04:42:37.070 --> 04:42:37.080 align:start position:0%
break it down into manageable chunks and
 
04:42:38.868 --> 04:42:38.878 align:start position:0%
a chapter is about as much as a study
 
04:42:41.030 --> 04:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
committee can manage and I'd like to
 
04:42:44.330 --> 04:42:44.340 align:start position:0%
also add that we it makes more sense to
 
04:42:46.250 --> 04:42:46.260 align:start position:0%
do a study committee than to send it to
 
04:42:47.930 --> 04:42:47.940 align:start position:0%
a subcommittee
 
04:42:52.368 --> 04:42:52.378 align:start position:0%
here because number one we'd have more
 
04:42:55.610 --> 04:42:55.620 align:start position:0%
input from outside people
 
04:42:57.830 --> 04:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
and number two they would be able to
 
04:42:59.810 --> 04:42:59.820 align:start position:0%
take a lot more time
 
04:43:02.030 --> 04:43:02.040 align:start position:0%
to go through and you probably need like
 
04:43:05.270 --> 04:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
four meetings to get through what we're
 
04:43:09.128 --> 04:43:09.138 align:start position:0%
proposing with this study committee so
 
04:43:11.390 --> 04:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
study committee I think is the way to go
 
04:43:13.788 --> 04:43:13.798 align:start position:0%
with this
 
04:43:16.570 --> 04:43:16.580 align:start position:0%
any other comments on HB 79
 
04:43:19.730 --> 04:43:19.740 align:start position:0%
representative Creighton uh yes ma'am
 
04:43:23.510 --> 04:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
chair the uh so first of all it was a
 
04:43:25.850 --> 04:43:25.860 align:start position:0%
great idea in my mind to take away that
 
04:43:28.670 --> 04:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
regulation and reduce the redundancy and
 
04:43:30.650 --> 04:43:30.660 align:start position:0%
I think capitalizing on that with a
 
04:43:33.590 --> 04:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
committee I'm in general a committee
 
04:43:35.270 --> 04:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
seems to be a way to just move things
 
04:43:38.628 --> 04:43:38.638 align:start position:0%
along and and so I'm not I always I
 
04:43:40.310 --> 04:43:40.320 align:start position:0%
won't always stand up and support a
 
04:43:42.350 --> 04:43:42.360 align:start position:0%
committee in general but in a specific
 
04:43:44.390 --> 04:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
case like this where you can reduce
 
04:43:46.610 --> 04:43:46.620 align:start position:0%
regulation reduce redundancy and
 
04:43:48.948 --> 04:43:48.958 align:start position:0%
capitalize on initiative that these guys
 
04:43:50.150 --> 04:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
are taking I think it makes a lot of
 
04:43:50.160 --> 04:43:53.208 align:start position:0%
are taking I think it makes a lot of
sense

04:43:53.208 --> 04:43:53.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:56.990 --> 04:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
okay any other comments
 
04:43:59.570 --> 04:43:59.580 align:start position:0%
okay when I also get a sense for where
 
04:44:02.628 --> 04:44:02.638 align:start position:0%
we're all thinking about hb128 relative
 
04:44:04.610 --> 04:44:04.620 align:start position:0%
to repealing State seed labeling license
 
04:44:04.620 --> 04:44:07.990 align:start position:0%
to repealing State seed labeling license
requirements

04:44:07.990 --> 04:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:10.190 --> 04:44:10.200 align:start position:0%
anybody have thoughts on that
 
04:44:13.368 --> 04:44:13.378 align:start position:0%
representative NAB
 
04:44:14.990 --> 04:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
other Representatives put it well when
 
04:44:16.970 --> 04:44:16.980 align:start position:0%
he said it felt like a law in search of
 
04:44:18.110 --> 04:44:18.120 align:start position:0%
a problem
 
04:44:19.610 --> 04:44:19.620 align:start position:0%
um I also felt like the commissioner
 
04:44:21.830 --> 04:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
made a good point in saying that he
 
04:44:23.390 --> 04:44:23.400 align:start position:0%
would have preferred the step come from
 
04:44:26.208 --> 04:44:26.218 align:start position:0%
an actual seed seller to so it's not
 
04:44:27.948 --> 04:44:27.958 align:start position:0%
clear to me that this is an issue that
 
04:44:30.128 --> 04:44:30.138 align:start position:0%
needs to be addressed and needs to be
 
04:44:32.990 --> 04:44:33.000 align:start position:0%
changed in this way
 
04:44:35.628 --> 04:44:35.638 align:start position:0%
so I I don't feel supportive of it as it
 
04:44:37.730 --> 04:44:37.740 align:start position:0%
is currently written anybody else
 
04:44:39.948 --> 04:44:39.958 align:start position:0%
represent Howard
 
04:44:43.310 --> 04:44:43.320 align:start position:0%
I um thank you madam chairman um I agree
 
04:44:45.410 --> 04:44:45.420 align:start position:0%
with with um Allison uh sorry
 
04:44:47.030 --> 04:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
representative knepp
 
04:44:50.030 --> 04:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
um and also I think that they said in um
 
04:44:52.970 --> 04:44:52.980 align:start position:0%
in the testimony that uh that it's not
 
04:44:55.430 --> 04:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
one that they particularly enforce
 
04:44:57.470 --> 04:44:57.480 align:start position:0%
anyway so it
 
04:44:59.868 --> 04:44:59.878 align:start position:0%
um it seems like it sort of watered down
 
04:45:02.150 --> 04:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:04.550 --> 04:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
represent Potenza
 
04:45:08.628 --> 04:45:08.638 align:start position:0%
I agree I I believe if this was an issue
 
04:45:10.670 --> 04:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
I think they should have had
 
04:45:12.288 --> 04:45:12.298 align:start position:0%
um people that are that are doing this
 
04:45:14.868 --> 04:45:14.878 align:start position:0%
that are selling seeds that um have some
 
04:45:16.970 --> 04:45:16.980 align:start position:0%
expertise on it I don't feel that it had
 
04:45:18.770 --> 04:45:18.780 align:start position:0%
enough substance for us to move that
 
04:45:18.780 --> 04:45:21.288 align:start position:0%
enough substance for us to move that
forward

04:45:21.288 --> 04:45:21.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:22.910 --> 04:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
representative Murray
 
04:45:25.490 --> 04:45:25.500 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair um yeah I also
 
04:45:26.990 --> 04:45:27.000 align:start position:0%
think that there are some other um
 
04:45:29.390 --> 04:45:29.400 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences that this could
 
04:45:31.610 --> 04:45:31.620 align:start position:0%
potentially have if it would move
 
04:45:34.730 --> 04:45:34.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:34.740 --> 04:45:36.530 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:45:36.530 --> 04:45:36.540 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:45:38.390 --> 04:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
all right well
 
04:45:38.400 --> 04:45:40.368 align:start position:0%
all right well
um

04:45:40.368 --> 04:45:40.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:45.110 --> 04:45:45.120 align:start position:0%
how about your feelings on HB 369 the
 
04:45:49.010 --> 04:45:49.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:51.530 --> 04:45:51.540 align:start position:0%
representative burlog yeah I kind of
 
04:45:53.810 --> 04:45:53.820 align:start position:0%
agreed with the commissioner Madam chair
 
04:45:56.510 --> 04:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
that you're taking away time from their
 
04:45:59.690 --> 04:45:59.700 align:start position:0%
UH responsibilities to look and create
 
04:46:01.910 --> 04:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
this separate task force which
 
04:46:03.770 --> 04:46:03.780 align:start position:0%
I'm sure they would say you know they
 
04:46:06.288 --> 04:46:06.298 align:start position:0%
would need the funding uh you know to
 
04:46:08.208 --> 04:46:08.218 align:start position:0%
get disorganized and to look into it
 
04:46:11.750 --> 04:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
rather than just put the onus on the you
 
04:46:12.948 --> 04:46:12.958 align:start position:0%
know the problem themselves to
 
04:46:14.570 --> 04:46:14.580 align:start position:0%
investigate to see if there are funds
 
04:46:16.670 --> 04:46:16.680 align:start position:0%
available to them and if there are they
 
04:46:19.310 --> 04:46:19.320 align:start position:0%
should rightfully uh be entitled to
 
04:46:20.990 --> 04:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
those within the inflation reduction act
 
04:46:23.570 --> 04:46:23.580 align:start position:0%
I just don't think uh you know creating
 
04:46:25.128 --> 04:46:25.138 align:start position:0%
this task force would be a good use of
 
04:46:25.138 --> 04:46:26.628 align:start position:0%
this task force would be a good use of
resources

04:46:26.628 --> 04:46:26.638 align:start position:0%
resources
 
04:46:29.990 --> 04:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
okay representative Creighton yeah the
 
04:46:32.930 --> 04:46:32.940 align:start position:0%
the one comment and listen carefully to
 
04:46:35.150 --> 04:46:35.160 align:start position:0%
the testimony but the the one comment
 
04:46:37.128 --> 04:46:37.138 align:start position:0%
that resonated me with me is if they
 
04:46:38.690 --> 04:46:38.700 align:start position:0%
passed this in August
 
04:46:41.750 --> 04:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
and they gave that down to the uh the
 
04:46:43.910 --> 04:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
different federal agencies that they
 
04:46:46.430 --> 04:46:46.440 align:start position:0%
would not have had time to figure out
 
04:46:47.930 --> 04:46:47.940 align:start position:0%
how they're going to implement these
 
04:46:49.250 --> 04:46:49.260 align:start position:0%
different things so I think this is
 
04:46:52.070 --> 04:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
maybe a little bit premature if you're
 
04:46:54.948 --> 04:46:54.958 align:start position:0%
actually going for the money that came
 
04:46:58.490 --> 04:46:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:01.788 --> 04:47:01.798 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby
 
04:47:06.410 --> 04:47:06.420 align:start position:0%
um I like I I like the idea of figuring
 
04:47:09.708 --> 04:47:09.718 align:start position:0%
out a way to support Farmers with this
 
04:47:13.990 --> 04:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
uh with the car the capital costs of
 
04:47:17.390 --> 04:47:17.400 align:start position:0%
moving solar forward on their Farms I um
 
04:47:17.400 --> 04:47:18.288 align:start position:0%
moving solar forward on their Farms I um
I

04:47:18.288 --> 04:47:18.298 align:start position:0%
I
 
04:47:22.010 --> 04:47:22.020 align:start position:0%
uh I'm met I spent a little bit time
 
04:47:25.010 --> 04:47:25.020 align:start position:0%
talking with uh the Hardys uh about
 
04:47:27.530 --> 04:47:27.540 align:start position:0%
their operation down at Brookvale Farm I
 
04:47:29.170 --> 04:47:29.180 align:start position:0%
know that they are
 
04:47:29.180 --> 04:47:30.890 align:start position:0%
know that they are
very

04:47:30.890 --> 04:47:30.900 align:start position:0%
very
 
04:47:30.900 --> 04:47:31.850 align:start position:0%
very
um

04:47:31.850 --> 04:47:31.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:34.610 --> 04:47:34.620 align:start position:0%
they're really attentive to what it
 
04:47:37.910 --> 04:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
takes to make farming work in the
 
04:47:40.788 --> 04:47:40.798 align:start position:0%
current situation which is a it's a very
 
04:47:43.368 --> 04:47:43.378 align:start position:0%
challenging time to be a farmer in New
 
04:47:47.810 --> 04:47:47.820 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and uh they are very good at
 
04:47:50.030 --> 04:47:50.040 align:start position:0%
identifying opportunities to make their
 
04:47:53.150 --> 04:47:53.160 align:start position:0%
farm work better and to serve their uh
 
04:47:54.770 --> 04:47:54.780 align:start position:0%
customers better and to serve their
 
04:47:57.350 --> 04:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
Community better I think that
 
04:47:59.270 --> 04:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
it's worth trying to take a little bit
 
04:48:01.368 --> 04:48:01.378 align:start position:0%
more look at it I think that the way
 
04:48:03.410 --> 04:48:03.420 align:start position:0%
that it is currently written is
 
04:48:05.448 --> 04:48:05.458 align:start position:0%
problematic and I think it might be
 
04:48:08.510 --> 04:48:08.520 align:start position:0%
worth sending this to a subcommittee and
 
04:48:11.628 --> 04:48:11.638 align:start position:0%
seeing if there is some way we can amend
 
04:48:15.110 --> 04:48:15.120 align:start position:0%
it to actually get it to do the job that
 
04:48:17.990 --> 04:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
it's intended to do I'm not sure I I
 
04:48:19.368 --> 04:48:19.378 align:start position:0%
think that subcommittee will the
 
04:48:21.110 --> 04:48:21.120 align:start position:0%
subcommittee will have to figure out you
 
04:48:22.850 --> 04:48:22.860 align:start position:0%
know is there a way to fix this or is it
 
04:48:24.170 --> 04:48:24.180 align:start position:0%
but I don't think we can figure out
 
04:48:26.510 --> 04:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
whether it's fixable
 
04:48:30.170 --> 04:48:30.180 align:start position:0%
um you know real you know this week so
 
04:48:30.180 --> 04:48:31.970 align:start position:0%
um you know real you know this week so
yeah

04:48:31.970 --> 04:48:31.980 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:48:35.690 --> 04:48:35.700 align:start position:0%
I'm almost leaning to retaining the bill
 
04:48:35.700 --> 04:48:36.708 align:start position:0%
I'm almost leaning to retaining the bill
um

04:48:36.708 --> 04:48:36.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:40.010 --> 04:48:40.020 align:start position:0%
and that way we can maybe talk about it
 
04:48:44.208 --> 04:48:44.218 align:start position:0%
later on yeah I I think it I would be
 
04:48:46.430 --> 04:48:46.440 align:start position:0%
more in favor of doing one one
 
04:48:48.770 --> 04:48:48.780 align:start position:0%
subcommittee session and seeing if
 
04:48:50.570 --> 04:48:50.580 align:start position:0%
there's something we can do and then if
 
04:48:53.510 --> 04:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
that if we if we say if we decide it has
 
04:48:55.850 --> 04:48:55.860 align:start position:0%
promise but we can't do it soon then
 
04:48:58.430 --> 04:48:58.440 align:start position:0%
we'll then retain it and if it looks
 
04:49:00.770 --> 04:49:00.780 align:start position:0%
like this is just
 
04:49:03.590 --> 04:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
um not this is not the way at all the
 
04:49:06.410 --> 04:49:06.420 align:start position:0%
way to do it and we can you know
 
04:49:08.448 --> 04:49:08.458 align:start position:0%
find some other approach in the coming
 
04:49:11.150 --> 04:49:11.160 align:start position:0%
year than we could itl it but I think
 
04:49:13.368 --> 04:49:13.378 align:start position:0%
I'd like to investigate it before we
 
04:49:15.170 --> 04:49:15.180 align:start position:0%
make that decision I agree uh
 
04:49:17.628 --> 04:49:17.638 align:start position:0%
representative Compton thank you madam
 
04:49:17.638 --> 04:49:18.948 align:start position:0%
representative Compton thank you madam
chair

04:49:18.948 --> 04:49:18.958 align:start position:0%
chair
 
04:49:18.958 --> 04:49:19.730 align:start position:0%
chair
um

04:49:19.730 --> 04:49:19.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:23.570 --> 04:49:23.580 align:start position:0%
in listening to all of the testimony and
 
04:49:24.948 --> 04:49:24.958 align:start position:0%
um probably somebody in the audience
 
04:49:27.708 --> 04:49:27.718 align:start position:0%
isn't going to like what I have to say
 
04:49:27.718 --> 04:49:29.410 align:start position:0%
isn't going to like what I have to say
um

04:49:29.410 --> 04:49:29.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:32.390 --> 04:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
but the New Hampshire Farm Bureau used
 
04:49:34.570 --> 04:49:34.580 align:start position:0%
to have an energy subcommittee
 
04:49:37.430 --> 04:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
that looks specifically at agriculture
 
04:49:40.070 --> 04:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
issues in energy and the issues that
 
04:49:42.230 --> 04:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
they're facing
 
04:49:45.110 --> 04:49:45.120 align:start position:0%
um and in listening to
 
04:49:45.120 --> 04:49:45.650 align:start position:0%
um and in listening to
um

04:49:45.650 --> 04:49:45.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:48.050 --> 04:49:48.060 align:start position:0%
the folks from the Department of energy
 
04:49:51.708 --> 04:49:51.718 align:start position:0%
and the Commissioner of Agriculture
 
04:49:54.110 --> 04:49:54.120 align:start position:0%
um there is questions if there is even
 
04:49:56.690 --> 04:49:56.700 align:start position:0%
funds available through a task force
 
04:49:58.730 --> 04:49:58.740 align:start position:0%
such as this
 
04:50:02.390 --> 04:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
um and I would like to see the Farm
 
04:50:05.750 --> 04:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
Bureau Institute the energy committee
 
04:50:08.990 --> 04:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
again uh to tackle on this instead of
 
04:50:10.610 --> 04:50:10.620 align:start position:0%
putting it on the legislature and then
 
04:50:12.590 --> 04:50:12.600 align:start position:0%
let them talk to us about what they
 
04:50:15.250 --> 04:50:15.260 align:start position:0%
their findings are
 
04:50:17.868 --> 04:50:17.878 align:start position:0%
representative Murray uh thank you madam
 
04:50:20.948 --> 04:50:20.958 align:start position:0%
chair I also have heard from other
 
04:50:23.930 --> 04:50:23.940 align:start position:0%
constituent stakeholders who have spoken
 
04:50:26.330 --> 04:50:26.340 align:start position:0%
to not just traditional farming such as
 
04:50:29.510 --> 04:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
Commodities like apples but other sorts
 
04:50:33.110 --> 04:50:33.120 align:start position:0%
of agricultural products that energy is
 
04:50:35.690 --> 04:50:35.700 align:start position:0%
a large portion of their
 
04:50:37.910 --> 04:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
costs associated with doing the business
 
04:50:40.310 --> 04:50:40.320 align:start position:0%
that they are doing and have looked to
 
04:50:42.830 --> 04:50:42.840 align:start position:0%
other things like solar and are trying
 
04:50:44.690 --> 04:50:44.700 align:start position:0%
to understand what is available to them
 
04:50:47.690 --> 04:50:47.700 align:start position:0%
so I would be inclined as representative
 
04:50:49.910 --> 04:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
Bixby said to at least give it
 
04:50:52.010 --> 04:50:52.020 align:start position:0%
a good shot to kind of take a look in
 
04:50:53.690 --> 04:50:53.700 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and see where we're going
 
04:50:55.730 --> 04:50:55.740 align:start position:0%
with this on behalf of some of those
 
04:50:58.010 --> 04:50:58.020 align:start position:0%
folks as well
 
04:51:01.310 --> 04:51:01.320 align:start position:0%
okay representative Howard
 
04:51:02.570 --> 04:51:02.580 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:51:04.610 --> 04:51:04.620 align:start position:0%
um I agree with Representatives Bixby
 
04:51:07.550 --> 04:51:07.560 align:start position:0%
and Murray I think it would be um
 
04:51:09.708 --> 04:51:09.718 align:start position:0%
it's almost a call to action to have
 
04:51:11.150 --> 04:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
something come out of this this
 
04:51:11.160 --> 04:51:12.250 align:start position:0%
something come out of this this
committee

04:51:12.250 --> 04:51:12.260 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:51:15.650 --> 04:51:15.660 align:start position:0%
addressing alternative energies on farms
 
04:51:18.470 --> 04:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
it's sort of in my mind new to the
 
04:51:20.270 --> 04:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
committee as I am it's a great
 
04:51:22.610 --> 04:51:22.620 align:start position:0%
combination of Agriculture and
 
04:51:22.620 --> 04:51:25.190 align:start position:0%
combination of Agriculture and
environment

04:51:25.190 --> 04:51:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:27.288 --> 04:51:27.298 align:start position:0%
representative Potenza
 
04:51:29.868 --> 04:51:29.878 align:start position:0%
I actually uh I agree just wanted to
 
04:51:31.850 --> 04:51:31.860 align:start position:0%
with representative rouliard am I
 
04:51:33.830 --> 04:51:33.840 align:start position:0%
pronouncing it correct
 
04:51:36.110 --> 04:51:36.120 align:start position:0%
um I think this is premature
 
04:51:38.448 --> 04:51:38.458 align:start position:0%
um in regards with the task force if
 
04:51:39.890 --> 04:51:39.900 align:start position:0%
there needs to be a subcommittee that
 
04:51:42.948 --> 04:51:42.958 align:start position:0%
wants to speak on it great but it's if
 
04:51:44.930 --> 04:51:44.940 align:start position:0%
these federal dollars are coming in and
 
04:51:47.270 --> 04:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
they're going to be going directly to
 
04:51:49.730 --> 04:51:49.740 align:start position:0%
Farmers I don't believe that we need to
 
04:51:52.550 --> 04:51:52.560 align:start position:0%
create more bureaucracy or a task force
 
04:51:54.470 --> 04:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
or a committee or anything like that
 
04:51:56.208 --> 04:51:56.218 align:start position:0%
they're going to have access to those
 
04:51:59.628 --> 04:51:59.638 align:start position:0%
funds there's many many agencies and
 
04:52:02.208 --> 04:52:02.218 align:start position:0%
committees already in this state that
 
04:52:05.150 --> 04:52:05.160 align:start position:0%
can help that I used to do a lot of
 
04:52:07.368 --> 04:52:07.378 align:start position:0%
grants in higher education and I just
 
04:52:10.070 --> 04:52:10.080 align:start position:0%
know that process so I really really
 
04:52:11.750 --> 04:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
believe that
 
04:52:15.230 --> 04:52:15.240 align:start position:0%
um if if it's necessary to have a have a
 
04:52:16.550 --> 04:52:16.560 align:start position:0%
meeting on it or a subcommittee meeting
 
04:52:18.890 --> 04:52:18.900 align:start position:0%
on it fine but I believe that this is
 
04:52:20.690 --> 04:52:20.700 align:start position:0%
premature and
 
04:52:23.750 --> 04:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
um and I know that energy is huge the
 
04:52:25.970 --> 04:52:25.980 align:start position:0%
cost of running especially a small farm
 
04:52:27.730 --> 04:52:27.740 align:start position:0%
is is
 
04:52:29.810 --> 04:52:29.820 align:start position:0%
astronomical I have some friends that
 
04:52:32.390 --> 04:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
have a farm in Loudon and they've
 
04:52:35.930 --> 04:52:35.940 align:start position:0%
reduced their size now in half from
 
04:52:37.850 --> 04:52:37.860 align:start position:0%
um in regards because of everything that
 
04:52:39.410 --> 04:52:39.420 align:start position:0%
happened during the pandemic the height
 
04:52:41.990 --> 04:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
of it and so it's um it's really hard
 
04:52:44.208 --> 04:52:44.218 align:start position:0%
for them to make ends meet and energy is
 
04:52:46.490 --> 04:52:46.500 align:start position:0%
a big deal so
 
04:52:49.310 --> 04:52:49.320 align:start position:0%
my two cents thank you
 
04:52:51.288 --> 04:52:51.298 align:start position:0%
for comments
 
04:52:55.010 --> 04:52:55.020 align:start position:0%
okay we'll move to the last one HB 252
 
04:52:57.350 --> 04:52:57.360 align:start position:0%
exempting agricultural operations from
 
04:52:59.628 --> 04:52:59.638 align:start position:0%
certain Municipal noise ordinances
 
04:53:01.788 --> 04:53:01.798 align:start position:0%
thoughts feelings
 
04:53:01.798 --> 04:53:08.030 align:start position:0%
thoughts feelings
observations

04:53:08.030 --> 04:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:10.490 --> 04:53:10.500 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby yeah
 
04:53:12.410 --> 04:53:12.420 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that
 
04:53:12.420 --> 04:53:13.250 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that
um

04:53:13.250 --> 04:53:13.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:53:15.890 --> 04:53:15.900 align:start position:0%
it I think it makes sense to go forward
 
04:53:19.430 --> 04:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
with this with uh with an amendment that
 
04:53:19.440 --> 04:53:20.448 align:start position:0%
with this with uh with an amendment that
would

04:53:20.448 --> 04:53:20.458 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:53:26.270 --> 04:53:26.280 align:start position:0%
um exclude the uh agritourism uh I think
 
04:53:26.280 --> 04:53:27.288 align:start position:0%
um exclude the uh agritourism uh I think
that

04:53:27.288 --> 04:53:27.298 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:53:27.298 --> 04:53:28.750 align:start position:0%
that
um

04:53:28.750 --> 04:53:28.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:53:31.030 --> 04:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
the municipal
 
04:53:33.890 --> 04:53:33.900 align:start position:0%
Association is always loaths to give up
 
04:53:37.190 --> 04:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
any part of their purview but in this
 
04:53:41.690 --> 04:53:41.700 align:start position:0%
particular case uh I think that
 
04:53:45.050 --> 04:53:45.060 align:start position:0%
having a farmer's livelihood depend on
 
04:53:47.090 --> 04:53:47.100 align:start position:0%
the sort of role of the daison who's in
 
04:53:50.030 --> 04:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
their Town select board in any given uh
 
04:53:53.990 --> 04:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
to to your term is not really a good way
 
04:53:56.510 --> 04:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
to support New Hampshire agriculture I
 
04:53:58.610 --> 04:53:58.620 align:start position:0%
agree with that thank you
 
04:54:01.010 --> 04:54:01.020 align:start position:0%
representative NAB
 
04:54:03.470 --> 04:54:03.480 align:start position:0%
um as a select board member I I have to
 
04:54:07.010 --> 04:54:07.020 align:start position:0%
support the nhma but um I you know I the
 
04:54:08.990 --> 04:54:09.000 align:start position:0%
size issue gives me a huge pause because
 
04:54:11.448 --> 04:54:11.458 align:start position:0%
I think the definition of farms is so
 
04:54:13.010 --> 04:54:13.020 align:start position:0%
broad that it concerns me a little bit
 
04:54:15.948 --> 04:54:15.958 align:start position:0%
that anybody who has any sort of farming
 
04:54:18.830 --> 04:54:18.840 align:start position:0%
operation on their property can say that
 
04:54:20.390 --> 04:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
they're a farm and it seems like the way
 
04:54:21.890 --> 04:54:21.900 align:start position:0%
the definition of farming is written
 
04:54:24.230 --> 04:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
that is true so
 
04:54:26.868 --> 04:54:26.878 align:start position:0%
um you know I I don't pretend to know
 
04:54:29.330 --> 04:54:29.340 align:start position:0%
the answer to that problem but I think
 
04:54:31.368 --> 04:54:31.378 align:start position:0%
it's a really I think it gives me
 
04:54:33.530 --> 04:54:33.540 align:start position:0%
concern that the definition of farming
 
04:54:35.150 --> 04:54:35.160 align:start position:0%
is so broad that this could be inclusive
 
04:54:37.070 --> 04:54:37.080 align:start position:0%
of almost anybody that has any
 
04:54:39.890 --> 04:54:39.900 align:start position:0%
production on their property
 
04:54:43.670 --> 04:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Murray thank
 
04:54:50.570 --> 04:54:50.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:52.190 --> 04:54:52.200 align:start position:0%
with always Leary when we're talking
 
04:54:54.170 --> 04:54:54.180 align:start position:0%
about right to farm or we're talking
 
04:54:56.330 --> 04:54:56.340 align:start position:0%
about I think that was 432 was that
 
04:54:56.340 --> 04:54:57.288 align:start position:0%
about I think that was 432 was that
correct

04:54:57.288 --> 04:54:57.298 align:start position:0%
correct
 
04:55:00.170 --> 04:55:00.180 align:start position:0%
and the intersection of that with uh
 
04:55:02.628 --> 04:55:02.638 align:start position:0%
this piece of legislation so I I want to
 
04:55:05.690 --> 04:55:05.700 align:start position:0%
be very careful that we're not
 
04:55:08.030 --> 04:55:08.040 align:start position:0%
butting up against that representative
 
04:55:11.330 --> 04:55:11.340 align:start position:0%
come talk uh thank you madam chair I
 
04:55:12.830 --> 04:55:12.840 align:start position:0%
just want to address representative
 
04:55:12.840 --> 04:55:13.910 align:start position:0%
just want to address representative
Murray

04:55:13.910 --> 04:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
Murray
 
04:55:17.390 --> 04:55:17.400 align:start position:0%
um the statute on nuisances and what we
 
04:55:20.448 --> 04:55:20.458 align:start position:0%
call the right to farm was looked at
 
04:55:21.948 --> 04:55:21.958 align:start position:0%
when all of these other things were
 
04:55:24.410 --> 04:55:24.420 align:start position:0%
happening and this is how this came
 
04:55:27.050 --> 04:55:27.060 align:start position:0%
about in discussions with the
 
04:55:30.350 --> 04:55:30.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner and the policy director at
 
04:55:32.330 --> 04:55:32.340 align:start position:0%
Farm Bureau and that's why this came out
 
04:55:34.850 --> 04:55:34.860 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't isn't going to do anything
 
04:55:37.730 --> 04:55:37.740 align:start position:0%
to harm that particular piece of
 
04:55:37.740 --> 04:55:38.810 align:start position:0%
to harm that particular piece of
legislation

04:55:38.810 --> 04:55:38.820 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
04:55:41.770 --> 04:55:41.780 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:44.750 --> 04:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
okay any other comments
 
04:55:47.208 --> 04:55:47.218 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if it might make sense to
 
04:55:48.948 --> 04:55:48.958 align:start position:0%
send this to subcommittee to see if it
 
04:55:51.350 --> 04:55:51.360 align:start position:0%
we could uh
 
04:55:54.410 --> 04:55:54.420 align:start position:0%
do a little bit of narrowing on the you
 
04:55:56.270 --> 04:55:56.280 align:start position:0%
know how we're defining Farm just in in
 
04:55:57.470 --> 04:55:57.480 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:55:59.390 --> 04:55:59.400 align:start position:0%
um or or specif a little bit more
 
04:56:02.270 --> 04:56:02.280 align:start position:0%
specification I think I'm not sure that
 
04:56:03.650 --> 04:56:03.660 align:start position:0%
we'll come to the right answer in a
 
04:56:05.990 --> 04:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee but I but it might be worth
 
04:56:10.128 --> 04:56:10.138 align:start position:0%
trying to uh you know do a little I'm
 
04:56:12.010 --> 04:56:12.020 align:start position:0%
just wondering if you know
 
04:56:12.020 --> 04:56:13.550 align:start position:0%
just wondering if you know
my

04:56:13.550 --> 04:56:13.560 align:start position:0%
my
 
04:56:17.208 --> 04:56:17.218 align:start position:0%
um my hat my quarter acre of production
 
04:56:20.390 --> 04:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
would count as a farm under this uh on
 
04:56:22.070 --> 04:56:22.080 align:start position:0%
under the current definition and I'm not
 
04:56:23.868 --> 04:56:23.878 align:start position:0%
sure that I would be really the right
 
04:56:26.030 --> 04:56:26.040 align:start position:0%
person to be qualified to take this
 
04:56:28.550 --> 04:56:28.560 align:start position:0%
exemption a representative thank you
 
04:56:30.050 --> 04:56:30.060 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
04:56:30.060 --> 04:56:31.970 align:start position:0%
madam chair
um

04:56:31.970 --> 04:56:31.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:35.090 --> 04:56:35.100 align:start position:0%
I have a colleague of mine who had was
 
04:56:39.470 --> 04:56:39.480 align:start position:0%
farming on a pretty large parcel of land
 
04:56:42.170 --> 04:56:42.180 align:start position:0%
and was leasing it but due to it being
 
04:56:45.070 --> 04:56:45.080 align:start position:0%
sold had to move to a small quarter acre
 
04:56:49.550 --> 04:56:49.560 align:start position:0%
plot where they now are substantially it
 
04:56:50.930 --> 04:56:50.940 align:start position:0%
is considered farming and they are
 
04:56:53.690 --> 04:56:53.700 align:start position:0%
making a great living selling flowers
 
04:56:57.230 --> 04:56:57.240 align:start position:0%
which is considered farming and to do
 
04:56:59.570 --> 04:56:59.580 align:start position:0%
anything because of the size of their a
 
04:57:02.708 --> 04:57:02.718 align:start position:0%
lot would be detrimental to them
 
04:57:05.330 --> 04:57:05.340 align:start position:0%
representative Murray ah thank you madam
 
04:57:06.890 --> 04:57:06.900 align:start position:0%
chair I also wonder about those types of
 
04:57:08.570 --> 04:57:08.580 align:start position:0%
things that are vertical in nature not
 
04:57:10.788 --> 04:57:10.798 align:start position:0%
necessarily horizontal like beekeeping
 
04:57:13.250 --> 04:57:13.260 align:start position:0%
and other types of things where land is
 
04:57:15.288 --> 04:57:15.298 align:start position:0%
not necessarily
 
04:57:17.270 --> 04:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
um the primary factor in how beekeeping
 
04:57:17.280 --> 04:57:19.010 align:start position:0%
um the primary factor in how beekeeping
Works

04:57:19.010 --> 04:57:19.020 align:start position:0%
Works
 
04:57:22.070 --> 04:57:22.080 align:start position:0%
um so to the degree that
 
04:57:24.650 --> 04:57:24.660 align:start position:0%
um well I understand that representative
 
04:57:26.448 --> 04:57:26.458 align:start position:0%
bixby's point I do want to make sure
 
04:57:28.850 --> 04:57:28.860 align:start position:0%
that we're also factoring in the to your
 
04:57:31.010 --> 04:57:31.020 align:start position:0%
point the rather broad nature of types
 
04:57:32.390 --> 04:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
of farming and I do understand your
 
04:57:33.650 --> 04:57:33.660 align:start position:0%
point of
 
04:57:36.708 --> 04:57:36.718 align:start position:0%
this the sense of of it being
 
04:57:39.050 --> 04:57:39.060 align:start position:0%
potentially broad but I think it may be
 
04:57:41.510 --> 04:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
an intentionally broad for a reason
 
04:57:44.868 --> 04:57:44.878 align:start position:0%
okay representative Bixby yeah the one
 
04:57:47.650 --> 04:57:47.660 align:start position:0%
thing that I I one thing I noticed in
 
04:57:50.448 --> 04:57:50.458 align:start position:0%
the definition of farm doesn't seem to
 
04:57:53.510 --> 04:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
have uh any indication of whether it is
 
04:57:57.650 --> 04:57:57.660 align:start position:0%
being run as a business or as a hobby or
 
04:58:00.708 --> 04:58:00.718 align:start position:0%
as a you know just growing food growing
 
04:58:03.590 --> 04:58:03.600 align:start position:0%
food for yourself so I'm wondering where
 
04:58:03.600 --> 04:58:04.670 align:start position:0%
food for yourself so I'm wondering where
the

04:58:04.670 --> 04:58:04.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:58:06.770 --> 04:58:06.780 align:start position:0%
if there's some sort of boundary where
 
04:58:09.650 --> 04:58:09.660 align:start position:0%
we need that we need to set in that in
 
04:58:11.330 --> 04:58:11.340 align:start position:0%
that regard
 
04:58:13.610 --> 04:58:13.620 align:start position:0%
representative contour and then
 
04:58:15.708 --> 04:58:15.718 align:start position:0%
representative knabb thank you madam
 
04:58:17.750 --> 04:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
chair uh representative Bixby to your
 
04:58:17.760 --> 04:58:18.890 align:start position:0%
chair uh representative Bixby to your
point

04:58:18.890 --> 04:58:18.900 align:start position:0%
point
 
04:58:22.430 --> 04:58:22.440 align:start position:0%
um and I understand uh the definition of
 
04:58:24.650 --> 04:58:24.660 align:start position:0%
farm is extremely broad but we have to
 
04:58:28.070 --> 04:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
uh look and see you know if you're
 
04:58:31.250 --> 04:58:31.260 align:start position:0%
growing food and or you're growing a
 
04:58:34.730 --> 04:58:34.740 align:start position:0%
small garden on your property you might
 
04:58:36.590 --> 04:58:36.600 align:start position:0%
be supplying food for your neighbors for
 
04:58:38.930 --> 04:58:38.940 align:start position:0%
others or for the food pantry and
 
04:58:41.570 --> 04:58:41.580 align:start position:0%
although it may not be a for-profit
 
04:58:44.270 --> 04:58:44.280 align:start position:0%
business it is considered a farming
 
04:58:46.070 --> 04:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
activity because you are helping others
 
04:58:48.350 --> 04:58:48.360 align:start position:0%
in the community and I think we have to
 
04:58:50.390 --> 04:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
be very cognizant of that when we're
 
04:58:54.350 --> 04:58:54.360 align:start position:0%
dealing with food Security in this state
 
04:58:56.390 --> 04:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
representative NAB
 
04:58:57.948 --> 04:58:57.958 align:start position:0%
well sorry
 
04:58:57.958 --> 04:58:59.150 align:start position:0%
well sorry
um

04:58:59.150 --> 04:58:59.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:01.070 --> 04:59:01.080 align:start position:0%
I was going to ask before you just made
 
04:59:02.690 --> 04:59:02.700 align:start position:0%
that point um is there any other way
 
04:59:04.250 --> 04:59:04.260 align:start position:0%
that someone identifies themselves as a
 
04:59:05.810 --> 04:59:05.820 align:start position:0%
farmer do they have any sort of permit
 
04:59:07.490 --> 04:59:07.500 align:start position:0%
for selling I'm not sorry I don't know
 
04:59:08.868 --> 04:59:08.878 align:start position:0%
the answer to it because I also have
 
04:59:10.430 --> 04:59:10.440 align:start position:0%
this side note but I had an issue with
 
04:59:12.230 --> 04:59:12.240 align:start position:0%
the constituent who wants to who was
 
04:59:13.610 --> 04:59:13.620 align:start position:0%
talking about Peruvian he was a farm and
 
04:59:14.810 --> 04:59:14.820 align:start position:0%
I said how do you prove you're a farmer
 
04:59:16.070 --> 04:59:16.080 align:start position:0%
in the state he said well you can have
 
04:59:17.868 --> 04:59:17.878 align:start position:0%
Farm plates but I just wonder if there's
 
04:59:19.970 --> 04:59:19.980 align:start position:0%
a workaround to the size of the farm if
 
04:59:22.788 --> 04:59:22.798 align:start position:0%
you you know besides like if you are
 
04:59:25.070 --> 04:59:25.080 align:start position:0%
selling or you're
 
04:59:54.850 --> 04:59:54.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:56.868 --> 04:59:56.878 align:start position:0%
representative Murray
 
04:59:58.670 --> 04:59:58.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and the other
 
04:59:59.750 --> 04:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
thing that I would like to make sure
 
05:00:01.910 --> 05:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
that we're being mindful of is
 
05:00:04.070 --> 05:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
homesteading and I think that we had
 
05:00:06.770 --> 05:00:06.780 align:start position:0%
recently addressed the cap and lifted
 
05:00:09.830 --> 05:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
that it was in 2020 or 2021 on the
 
05:00:13.128 --> 05:00:13.138 align:start position:0%
dollar amount that um one one could earn
 
05:00:15.350 --> 05:00:15.360 align:start position:0%
and so I do want to make sure that that
 
05:00:17.448 --> 05:00:17.458 align:start position:0%
is also a type of farming Homestead
 
05:00:19.190 --> 05:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
farming and
 
05:00:19.200 --> 05:00:20.390 align:start position:0%
farming and
um I'm

05:00:20.390 --> 05:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
um I'm
 
05:00:22.970 --> 05:00:22.980 align:start position:0%
curious just to sort of
 
05:00:25.010 --> 05:00:25.020 align:start position:0%
see how those two intersect with
 
05:00:27.170 --> 05:00:27.180 align:start position:0%
traditional quote farming representative
 
05:00:29.470 --> 05:00:29.480 align:start position:0%
come talk uh thank you madam chair
 
05:00:32.030 --> 05:00:32.040 align:start position:0%
canning and harvesting of vegetables is
 
05:00:34.730 --> 05:00:34.740 align:start position:0%
considered a farming activity so
 
05:00:36.830 --> 05:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
anything to anything to do with
 
05:00:38.690 --> 05:00:38.700 align:start position:0%
basically your food is under that
 
05:00:40.788 --> 05:00:40.798 align:start position:0%
activity so that would be consistent
 
05:00:43.788 --> 05:00:43.798 align:start position:0%
with keeping the homestead
 
05:00:46.550 --> 05:00:46.560 align:start position:0%
yep representative Potenza
 
05:00:48.470 --> 05:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to
 
05:00:51.530 --> 05:00:51.540 align:start position:0%
um just uh ditto with what you said and
 
05:00:54.708 --> 05:00:54.718 align:start position:0%
I think that the longer that we
 
05:00:57.830 --> 05:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
um go through all of this we are we're
 
05:00:59.030 --> 05:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
one of the most
 
05:00:59.040 --> 05:00:59.628 align:start position:0%
one of the most
um

05:00:59.628 --> 05:00:59.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:01:02.208 --> 05:01:02.218 align:start position:0%
farming friendly states in the country
 
05:01:05.868 --> 05:01:05.878 align:start position:0%
and I just I think this definition is
 
05:01:08.628 --> 05:01:08.638 align:start position:0%
Broad by Design and it should be you
 
05:01:09.948 --> 05:01:09.958 align:start position:0%
don't have to
 
05:01:11.570 --> 05:01:11.580 align:start position:0%
um to be a farmer you don't have to sell
 
05:01:13.910 --> 05:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
you don't have to have a business you
 
05:01:16.010 --> 05:01:16.020 align:start position:0%
can just have a little stand there's I
 
05:01:18.890 --> 05:01:18.900 align:start position:0%
have an uh very close by neighbor about
 
05:01:22.310 --> 05:01:22.320 align:start position:0%
a mile away and they literally give all
 
05:01:23.930 --> 05:01:23.940 align:start position:0%
of their extra vegetables from their
 
05:01:26.570 --> 05:01:26.580 align:start position:0%
quote-unquote Farm they leave their you
 
05:01:28.550 --> 05:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
know a little box that maybe give a
 
05:01:29.990 --> 05:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
donation if you want to take their eggs
 
05:01:32.930 --> 05:01:32.940 align:start position:0%
and stuff like that so I just think that
 
05:01:36.350 --> 05:01:36.360 align:start position:0%
um we should uh we don't need to mess
 
05:01:40.010 --> 05:01:40.020 align:start position:0%
with this at all so I'm for it and uh I
 
05:01:42.230 --> 05:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
think we should move on okay well I know
 
05:01:45.050 --> 05:01:45.060 align:start position:0%
that um representative come to us going
 
05:01:48.708 --> 05:01:48.718 align:start position:0%
to have a few changes to make to this
 
05:01:52.670 --> 05:01:52.680 align:start position:0%
Bill to that she's intending on bringing
 
05:01:54.350 --> 05:01:54.360 align:start position:0%
an amendment anyway
 
05:01:56.810 --> 05:01:56.820 align:start position:0%
I'm not so certain that we need to go to
 
05:01:58.730 --> 05:01:58.740 align:start position:0%
subcommittee with this
 
05:02:00.350 --> 05:02:00.360 align:start position:0%
um I don't know what's your thought
 
05:02:03.350 --> 05:02:03.360 align:start position:0%
representative come talk
 
05:02:05.448 --> 05:02:05.458 align:start position:0%
in a moment
 
05:02:07.850 --> 05:02:07.860 align:start position:0%
um Madam chair I think that it we were
 
05:02:09.530 --> 05:02:09.540 align:start position:0%
in agreement I was in agreement with the
 
05:02:12.770 --> 05:02:12.780 align:start position:0%
commissioner uh commissioner Jasper and
 
05:02:14.868 --> 05:02:14.878 align:start position:0%
with Rob Johnson that we need to exclude
 
05:02:17.270 --> 05:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
the agritourism section of that you know
 
05:02:20.030 --> 05:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
regarding uh you know people that have
 
05:02:22.610 --> 05:02:22.620 align:start position:0%
weddings or bands or things like that on
 
05:02:24.110 --> 05:02:24.120 align:start position:0%
their property and make that as an
 
05:02:26.750 --> 05:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
exception to this other than that I
 
05:02:29.510 --> 05:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
don't see any reason for this not to go
 
05:02:33.590 --> 05:02:33.600 align:start position:0%
forward thank you representative Howard
 
05:02:36.170 --> 05:02:36.180 align:start position:0%
um I I thank you I I
 
05:02:38.330 --> 05:02:38.340 align:start position:0%
um respectfully disagree with with
 
05:02:41.810 --> 05:02:41.820 align:start position:0%
representative I would um I don't think
 
05:02:43.190 --> 05:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
we should
 
05:02:46.550 --> 05:02:46.560 align:start position:0%
um just uh
 
05:02:47.750 --> 05:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
um sorry
 
05:02:49.208 --> 05:02:49.218 align:start position:0%
um agriculture
 
05:02:52.190 --> 05:02:52.200 align:start position:0%
agricourism out of the out of the bill
 
05:02:54.788 --> 05:02:54.798 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe make an exception for
 
05:02:58.128 --> 05:02:58.138 align:start position:0%
non-farm loud noises like bands and
 
05:03:01.190 --> 05:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
stuff like that but you know I could see
 
05:03:04.250 --> 05:03:04.260 align:start position:0%
I I just think that the agriculture part
 
05:03:06.530 --> 05:03:06.540 align:start position:0%
of agritourism needs to have the same
 
05:03:08.090 --> 05:03:08.100 align:start position:0%
the same
 
05:03:10.430 --> 05:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
um rules as agriculture outside of
 
05:03:15.410 --> 05:03:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:18.050 --> 05:03:18.060 align:start position:0%
thank you my only concern with this and
 
05:03:21.350 --> 05:03:21.360 align:start position:0%
and I like to get out and pound T posts
 
05:03:23.030 --> 05:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
at six o'clock in the morning you know
 
05:03:24.350 --> 05:03:24.360 align:start position:0%
before it gets hot in the summer and
 
05:03:25.550 --> 05:03:25.560 align:start position:0%
everything too so I completely
 
05:03:28.610 --> 05:03:28.620 align:start position:0%
understand my concern would be that in
 
05:03:30.590 --> 05:03:30.600 align:start position:0%
more urban areas
 
05:03:33.890 --> 05:03:33.900 align:start position:0%
it or in general if people were going to
 
05:03:36.890 --> 05:03:36.900 align:start position:0%
start abusing this in any way with the
 
05:03:39.288 --> 05:03:39.298 align:start position:0%
noise are we taking away the right of
 
05:03:41.810 --> 05:03:41.820 align:start position:0%
you know municipalities to be able to
 
05:03:45.650 --> 05:03:45.660 align:start position:0%
step in and address the situation
 
05:03:48.110 --> 05:03:48.120 align:start position:0%
representative NAB
 
05:03:49.550 --> 05:03:49.560 align:start position:0%
um I will say having met on this
 
05:03:51.050 --> 05:03:51.060 align:start position:0%
Blackboard for four years I think the
 
05:03:52.250 --> 05:03:52.260 align:start position:0%
only time we've ever had a problem with
 
05:03:54.230 --> 05:03:54.240 align:start position:0%
the noise ordinance was a farm that runs
 
05:03:56.628 --> 05:03:56.638 align:start position:0%
weddings out of their Barn so I strongly
 
05:03:58.670 --> 05:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
agree with excluding agritourism I think
 
05:04:00.350 --> 05:04:00.360 align:start position:0%
that's a big issue
 
05:04:02.990 --> 05:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
um and makes us totally separate type of
 
05:04:06.650 --> 05:04:06.660 align:start position:0%
noise than comes from farming activities
 
05:04:10.128 --> 05:04:10.138 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby yeah just uh as an
 
05:04:12.770 --> 05:04:12.780 align:start position:0%
explanation of the way that agritourism
 
05:04:15.470 --> 05:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
is is built into the statute
 
05:04:19.310 --> 05:04:19.320 align:start position:0%
um it is defined as a marketing activity
 
05:04:22.788 --> 05:04:22.798 align:start position:0%
that is ancillary to the farming but you
 
05:04:26.510 --> 05:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
have to have the the the the farm so the
 
05:04:28.430 --> 05:04:28.440 align:start position:0%
farm you can't be an agitourism
 
05:04:31.550 --> 05:04:31.560 align:start position:0%
operation without already being a fully
 
05:04:33.230 --> 05:04:33.240 align:start position:0%
operational Farm
 
05:04:37.850 --> 05:04:37.860 align:start position:0%
so uh so you can't so um I think that uh
 
05:04:37.860 --> 05:04:39.530 align:start position:0%
so uh so you can't so um I think that uh
that's

05:04:39.530 --> 05:04:39.540 align:start position:0%
that's
 
05:04:42.650 --> 05:04:42.660 align:start position:0%
that um putting saying that agritourism
 
05:04:46.430 --> 05:04:46.440 align:start position:0%
is excluded from this uh noise ordinance
 
05:04:50.390 --> 05:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
or or whatever uh from from the excluded
 
05:04:53.150 --> 05:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
from the exemption uh is appropriate
 
05:04:55.510 --> 05:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
because it is specifically designed
 
05:04:58.490 --> 05:04:58.500 align:start position:0%
defined as ancillary to the operation of
 
05:05:01.430 --> 05:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
a fully operational Farm
 
05:05:01.440 --> 05:05:03.470 align:start position:0%
a fully operational Farm
okay

05:05:03.470 --> 05:05:03.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:05:10.670 --> 05:05:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:10.680 --> 05:05:12.288 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

05:05:12.288 --> 05:05:12.298 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:05:12.298 --> 05:05:15.410 align:start position:0%
yeah
sure

05:05:15.410 --> 05:05:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:18.368 --> 05:05:18.378 align:start position:0%
I was going to say that
 
05:05:21.410 --> 05:05:21.420 align:start position:0%
all right um I'm gonna wrap this up for
 
05:05:23.810 --> 05:05:23.820 align:start position:0%
today I thank you all for your time and
 
05:05:26.810 --> 05:05:26.820 align:start position:0%
your attentiveness and um well I guess
 
05:05:28.610 --> 05:05:28.620 align:start position:0%
I'll see you next week
 
05:05:35.990 --> 05:05:36.000 align:start position:0%

thank you very much we'll adjourn for
 
05:05:38.458 --> 05:05:50.530 align:start position:0%
thank you very much we'll adjourn for
today

05:05:50.530 --> 05:05:50.540 align:start position:0%
