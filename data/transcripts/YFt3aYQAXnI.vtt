from Cal district 6 which is the
 
00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:48.760 align:start position:0%
communities of wolf BR T and Broner
 
00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:51.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh this is a fairly Common
 
00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:53.640 align:start position:0%
Sense Bill uh that I'm surprised hasn't
 
00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
been brought to the committee's
 
00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:57.080 align:start position:0%
attention before this and it just makes
 
00:08:59.829 --> 00:08:59.839 align:start position:0%
some minor changes on captain D we will
 
00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:01.640 align:start position:0%
talk to some of the incidents he's
 
00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:04.760 align:start position:0%
observed uh within Mar mature buau but
 
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
it just makes the uh owner of the boat
 
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:09.640 align:start position:0%
required to file an accident report in
 
00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
the event the operator doesn't file the
 
00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:16.120 align:start position:0%
report um and that's that's basically
 
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:28.200 align:start position:0%
about are you is that your testimony y
 
00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:30.200 align:start position:0%
it's very simple common sense and
 
00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:36.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:40.269 --> 00:09:40.279 align:start position:0%
much your excuse thank you
 
00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:42.720 align:start position:0%
uh excuse me is there any questions by
 
00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:45.200 align:start position:0%
members I'm I'm retra I'm in retraining
 
00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:48.310 align:start position:0%
members I'm I'm retra I'm in retraining
I'm

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:50.829 --> 00:09:50.839 align:start position:0%
old uh were there any questions for
 
00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:53.240 align:start position:0%
members of the uh of the
 
00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
00:09:59.310 --> 00:09:59.320 align:start position:0%
Darby thank you Mr chairman sorry I
 
00:10:01.389 --> 00:10:01.399 align:start position:0%
agree this is a common sense bill um I
 
00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:03.880 align:start position:0%
noticed that you know as I read the bill
 
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
there's three main parts uh you know of
 
00:10:11.509 --> 00:10:11.519 align:start position:0%
the existing law that is um that's being
 
00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:13.800 align:start position:0%
and one part that's being amended so um
 
00:10:14.829 --> 00:10:14.839 align:start position:0%
you know if you're in an accident you
 
00:10:16.509 --> 00:10:16.519 align:start position:0%
have to stop help and exchange
 
00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:18.200 align:start position:0%
information you have to immediately
 
00:10:22.829 --> 00:10:22.839 align:start position:0%
notify Marine Patrol or um or uh police
 
00:10:24.509 --> 00:10:24.519 align:start position:0%
or someone if Marine Patrol is not
 
00:10:26.829 --> 00:10:26.839 align:start position:0%
present and you can't exchange with the
 
00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
uh uh with uh uh
 
00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
the other party um and then you have to
 
00:10:35.629 --> 00:10:35.639 align:start position:0%
file a report within 15 days this bill
 
00:10:40.949 --> 00:10:40.959 align:start position:0%
as I read it says that if the um if the
 
00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
uh the party that was in that caused the
 
00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:46.160 align:start position:0%
accident hasn't filed the report within
 
00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:48.680 align:start position:0%
15 days then the owner has to file the
 
00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
report instead but the thing that I'm
 
00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:53.240 align:start position:0%
wondering about is the immediate
 
00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
notification so the you know if we look
 
00:10:59.069 --> 00:10:59.079 align:start position:0%
at um didn't I don't have there it is
 
00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:02.680 align:start position:0%
line 12 of the existing test text says
 
00:11:05.269 --> 00:11:05.279 align:start position:0%
immediately notify Marine patrol officer
 
00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
or other officer but this bill says um
 
00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:10.760 align:start position:0%
if they haven't filed the report in 15
 
00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:12.760 align:start position:0%
days then you have to file the report I
 
00:11:16.389 --> 00:11:16.399 align:start position:0%
wonder if the um if the owner as soon as
 
00:11:19.269 --> 00:11:19.279 align:start position:0%
they are aware that the that the um
 
00:11:22.269 --> 00:11:22.279 align:start position:0%
incident hasn't been reported should uh
 
00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:25.000 align:start position:0%
should have to immediately notify Marine
 
00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:27.800 align:start position:0%
Patrol um so that the 15-day period
 
00:11:31.949 --> 00:11:31.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:33.069 --> 00:11:33.079 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:11:33.079 --> 00:11:34.590 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
representative

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:34.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
um this has been in effect for as long
 
00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
as I can recall this particular RSA and
 
00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:42.920 align:start position:0%
we worked closely with the remol to try
 
00:11:44.389 --> 00:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
to figure out the best way to move
 
00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:47.480 align:start position:0%
forward and this is what they suggested
 
00:11:49.629 --> 00:11:49.639 align:start position:0%
uh I think that's a good idea that you
 
00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned I just would like to have
 
00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:53.160 align:start position:0%
Captain dunlevy answer your question see
 
00:11:54.829 --> 00:11:54.839 align:start position:0%
how that would work for the Department
 
00:11:57.949 --> 00:11:57.959 align:start position:0%
itself we could thank
 
00:11:57.959 --> 00:11:59.670 align:start position:0%
itself we could thank
you

00:11:59.670 --> 00:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:02.920 align:start position:0%
any any other questions from the
 
00:12:05.829 --> 00:12:05.839 align:start position:0%
committee thank you Mr chair um I just
 
00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:08.120 align:start position:0%
wondered if there's a story behind the
 
00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
bill if there's uh someone who came to
 
00:12:13.509 --> 00:12:13.519 align:start position:0%
you or what was the Genesis that
 
00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:16.120 align:start position:0%
way I'm sure Captain dun liy has many
 
00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
stories uh because he and they're all
 
00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
true uh because we talked about this
 
00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
bill in previous sessions and I'm sure
 
00:12:26.189 --> 00:12:26.199 align:start position:0%
he'd be glad to relay those stories to
 
00:12:31.269 --> 00:12:31.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:34.069 --> 00:12:34.079 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
members seeing none thank you for your
 
00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you for your time
 
00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:51.320 align:start position:0%
Levy good morning Mr chair honorable
 
00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
members of the committee it's good to
 
00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
see you my name is Tim Dunley and I come
 
00:12:57.189 --> 00:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
before you today uh representing the
 
00:12:59.150 --> 00:12:59.160 align:start position:0%
department of safety uh Marine Patrol
 
00:13:02.269 --> 00:13:02.279 align:start position:0%
unit uh we come today uh supporting this
 
00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
bill um as representative McDonald
 
00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:07.880 align:start position:0%
indicated we've see this as being
 
00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:12.360 align:start position:0%
somewhat of a long overdue and a common
 
00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:13.430 align:start position:0%
somewhat of a long overdue and a common
sense

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
sense
 
00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
bill in circumstances where we have had
 
00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:20.120 align:start position:0%
boating accidents in the past where
 
00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes the operator is not the owner
 
00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
um perhaps they're impaired perhaps for
 
00:13:28.069 --> 00:13:28.079 align:start position:0%
whatever reason they become
 
00:13:30.389 --> 00:13:30.399 align:start position:0%
incapacitated perhaps they've suffered
 
00:13:33.389 --> 00:13:33.399 align:start position:0%
personal injury they're not capable of
 
00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:36.120 align:start position:0%
filing the report as required by
 
00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:40.240 align:start position:0%
law um the current statute says that
 
00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:43.000 align:start position:0%
when that happens the owner is
 
00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:45.560 align:start position:0%
responsible for filing that
 
00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:48.720 align:start position:0%
paperwork the problem we're having is
 
00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:51.160 align:start position:0%
those boat accidents that occur
 
00:13:53.389 --> 00:13:53.399 align:start position:0%
sometimes in the middle of the night
 
00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
sometimes in a remote body of water
 
00:13:58.310 --> 00:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
where there aren't anybody isn't anyone
 
00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
around to observe
 
00:14:03.389 --> 00:14:03.399 align:start position:0%
it um perhaps there's some sort of
 
00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
criminal activity associated with it
 
00:14:07.189 --> 00:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
whether it be the condition of the
 
00:14:09.509 --> 00:14:09.519 align:start position:0%
operator or or the circumstances by
 
00:14:10.829 --> 00:14:10.839 align:start position:0%
which the accident
 
00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:13.880 align:start position:0%
happened we find boats up on shorelines
 
00:14:16.069 --> 00:14:16.079 align:start position:0%
in the trees with no one around the next
 
00:14:19.069 --> 00:14:19.079 align:start position:0%
morning and often times we've learned
 
00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
that the owner is oftentimes the
 
00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:25.000 align:start position:0%
operator um and those reports aren't
 
00:14:28.269 --> 00:14:28.279 align:start position:0%
being made to us in a timely fashion to
 
00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:31.000 align:start position:0%
invest truly what happened we get a
 
00:14:33.629 --> 00:14:33.639 align:start position:0%
piece of paperwork 15 days later and
 
00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:37.480 align:start position:0%
it's a surprise to us so this statute
 
00:14:41.069 --> 00:14:41.079 align:start position:0%
requires the operator to notify us
 
00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
immediately when they can and if they
 
00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
cannot it's putting the onus on the
 
00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:50.600 align:start position:0%
owner we've had circumstances where
 
00:14:53.269 --> 00:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
people make phone calls come and get us
 
00:14:55.269 --> 00:14:55.279 align:start position:0%
our boats high and dry on the
 
00:14:58.110 --> 00:14:58.120 align:start position:0%
shoreline um we need to get out of here
 
00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
and the owner is present um so this is
 
00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:02.920 align:start position:0%
just putting more responsibility on the
 
00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
owner once they become aware of the
 
00:15:07.389 --> 00:15:07.399 align:start position:0%
incident whether they're there or not to
 
00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
notify us the timeline for filing the
 
00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:13.160 align:start position:0%
reports is not changing we are looking
 
00:15:15.269 --> 00:15:15.279 align:start position:0%
for that immediate
 
00:15:17.629 --> 00:15:17.639 align:start position:0%
notification once they become aware of
 
00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:21.560 align:start position:0%
it so to uh perhaps answer
 
00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
representative Darby's question of
 
00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:24.949 align:start position:0%
representative Darby's question of
earlier

00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:24.959 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
00:15:27.829 --> 00:15:27.839 align:start position:0%
um we're not increasing or decreasing
 
00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:30.040 align:start position:0%
the time they have to file the report
 
00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:31.720 align:start position:0%
it's to make notification to law
 
00:15:33.389 --> 00:15:33.399 align:start position:0%
enforcement officials that the incident
 
00:15:33.399 --> 00:15:34.350 align:start position:0%
enforcement officials that the incident
has

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:34.360 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:36.920 align:start position:0%
occurred and once they become aware of
 
00:15:40.389 --> 00:15:40.399 align:start position:0%
it that's when they need to notify
 
00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:44.240 align:start position:0%
us and that that change and I I'll
 
00:15:49.509 --> 00:15:49.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
line line 19 and 20 is if the owner of
 
00:15:55.629 --> 00:15:55.639 align:start position:0%
the vessel uh once they become aware of
 
00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:01.160 align:start position:0%
it forth with will notify um
 
00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:04.240 align:start position:0%
immediately that's the the the purpose
 
00:16:07.069 --> 00:16:07.079 align:start position:0%
uh of this bill and uh I'm happy to
 
00:16:10.389 --> 00:16:10.399 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that you may
 
00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
have any questions from the
 
00:16:18.309 --> 00:16:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:20.920 align:start position:0%
committee I just want to read this
 
00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:23.680 align:start position:0%
briefly now that I understand the um so
 
00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:26.079 align:start position:0%
just like have one minute one second to
 
00:16:28.069 --> 00:16:28.079 align:start position:0%
sort of read this I do have another
 
00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:31.000 align:start position:0%
question um it says immediate
 
00:16:33.829 --> 00:16:33.839 align:start position:0%
notification of um you know to Marine
 
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
Patrol does that would would calling
 
00:16:38.309 --> 00:16:38.319 align:start position:0%
Marine Patrol um suffice for immediate
 
00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:41.800 align:start position:0%
notification absolutely sir okay thank
 
00:16:45.189 --> 00:16:45.199 align:start position:0%
you Captain I have a question yes sir
 
00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
how easy is it for an owner to verify if
 
00:16:51.309 --> 00:16:51.319 align:start position:0%
a report was done or not are these
 
00:16:53.949 --> 00:16:53.959 align:start position:0%
reports immediately public uh
 
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
information accessible to
 
00:16:58.629 --> 00:16:58.639 align:start position:0%
everyone um as the owner of the vessel
 
00:17:00.949 --> 00:17:00.959 align:start position:0%
certainly it would be uh there may be
 
00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:04.079 align:start position:0%
some information in the report as to
 
00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
passengers and that sort of thing that
 
00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:07.079 align:start position:0%
would need to be redacted it would not
 
00:17:09.429 --> 00:17:09.439 align:start position:0%
be public information but the fact that
 
00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
the incident occurred and the vessel
 
00:17:14.549 --> 00:17:14.559 align:start position:0%
involved uh would be public information
 
00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
and so they would and certainly the way
 
00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:19.640 align:start position:0%
this statute is written uh any
 
00:17:21.870 --> 00:17:21.880 align:start position:0%
culpability on behalf of that owner
 
00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
would be something the state would need
 
00:17:25.949 --> 00:17:25.959 align:start position:0%
to prove uh should they be in violation
 
00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:29.320 align:start position:0%
so uh this is not just an arbitrary
 
00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:31.000 align:start position:0%
action on behalf of Marine Patrol to
 
00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:32.240 align:start position:0%
charge an owner because they don't have
 
00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:33.880 align:start position:0%
paperwork and didn't know about it
 
00:17:35.549 --> 00:17:35.559 align:start position:0%
there's obviously some culpability there
 
00:17:37.669 --> 00:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
that we would need to
 
00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:40.480 align:start position:0%
demonstrate thank you
 
00:17:42.909 --> 00:17:42.919 align:start position:0%
Captain thank you Mr
 
00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:47.080 align:start position:0%
chair um so I and just tell you the my
 
00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:50.440 align:start position:0%
the line that I'm concerned with um the
 
00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
the qualifying Clause of if the operator
 
00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
this is on line 17 if the operator is
 
00:17:57.990 --> 00:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
physically or mentally incapable of
 
00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:00.640 align:start position:0%
making report or fails or refuses to
 
00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
make the
 
00:18:05.549 --> 00:18:05.559 align:start position:0%
report um do do dot then the owner has
 
00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:07.880 align:start position:0%
to forth with notify so the fourth with
 
00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
notify makes sense to me the thing that
 
00:18:13.549 --> 00:18:13.559 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned about is that um
 
00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
the the notification is based on the
 
00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:20.440 align:start position:0%
report the failure uh to file the report
 
00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:27.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:29.549 align:start position:0%
 
days

00:18:29.549 --> 00:18:29.559 align:start position:0%
days
 
00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:32.120 align:start position:0%
I I see what you're saying
 
00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:34.149 align:start position:0%
I I see what you're saying
um

00:18:34.149 --> 00:18:34.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:38.240 align:start position:0%
so we would we would not as long as that
 
00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:42.830 align:start position:0%
so we would we would not as long as that
operator

00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:46.909 --> 00:18:46.919 align:start position:0%
um I may take just a moment uh I think I
 
00:18:46.919 --> 00:18:57.310 align:start position:0%
um I may take just a moment uh I think I
follow

00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:57.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:00.669 --> 00:19:00.679 align:start position:0%
you does the fact in line
 
00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
19 say after after learning of the
 
00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:05.960 align:start position:0%
accident again the state would have to
 
00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
prove that owner has learned of the
 
00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:12.200 align:start position:0%
accident um cover your
 
00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:16.120 align:start position:0%
concern I believe it would yes thank
 
00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:20.200 align:start position:0%

before we break I've passed the gavel
 
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:07.360 align:start position:0%
over to the vice chair because but the
 
00:20:11.549 --> 00:20:11.559 align:start position:0%
clerk and the my clerk and the backup
 
00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
clerk are not going to be here so I
 
00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
guess I'm the third I'm the backup to
 
00:20:21.669 --> 00:20:21.679 align:start position:0%
the backup so so I'll be doing the
 
00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
clerking and uh the uh sh and the vice
 
00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:28.760 align:start position:0%

attempt to clarify as briefly as
 
01:02:11.710 --> 01:02:11.720 align:start position:0%
possible first the intent of this bill
 
01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
is to balance the opportunity to wake
 
01:02:15.829 --> 01:02:15.839 align:start position:0%
surf with other top opportunities to
 
01:02:18.109 --> 01:02:18.119 align:start position:0%
enjoy the lake while also considering
 
01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
environmental concerns I would expect
 
01:02:22.390 --> 01:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
water bodies with responsible wake
 
01:02:24.589 --> 01:02:24.599 align:start position:0%
Surfers who observe the Marine trade
 
01:02:26.390 --> 01:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
guidelines to have no additional
 
01:02:29.069 --> 01:02:29.079 align:start position:0%
regulations imposed as a result of this
 
01:02:32.190 --> 01:02:32.200 align:start position:0%
bill instead it targets those Lakes
 
01:02:34.750 --> 01:02:34.760 align:start position:0%
where conflict already exists due to
 
01:02:36.269 --> 01:02:36.279 align:start position:0%
Reckless wake
 
01:02:38.510 --> 01:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
surfing this bill is modeled after
 
01:02:40.390 --> 01:02:40.400 align:start position:0%
existing New Hampshire laws permitting
 
01:02:43.349 --> 01:02:43.359 align:start position:0%
restrictions on horsepower speed and ski
 
01:02:46.349 --> 01:02:46.359 align:start position:0%
craft which protect a Lakefront owner's
 
01:02:49.109 --> 01:02:49.119 align:start position:0%
property the lake ecosystem and
 
01:02:51.190 --> 01:02:51.200 align:start position:0%
establish uses on water
 
01:02:55.190 --> 01:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
bodies to begin 25 residents or Property
 
01:02:57.470 --> 01:02:57.480 align:start position:0%
Owners must submit a petition to the
 
01:02:59.349 --> 01:02:59.359 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety to request a
 
01:03:01.549 --> 01:03:01.559 align:start position:0%
hearing if they want to impose wake
 
01:03:05.349 --> 01:03:05.359 align:start position:0%
surfing limitations or restrictions note
 
01:03:06.789 --> 01:03:06.799 align:start position:0%
this is more than double the number
 
01:03:09.630 --> 01:03:09.640 align:start position:0%
required to petition for ski craft
 
01:03:12.190 --> 01:03:12.200 align:start position:0%
restrictions next the petitioners must
 
01:03:14.750 --> 01:03:14.760 align:start position:0%
send certified mail to all Property
 
01:03:18.190 --> 01:03:18.200 align:start position:0%
Owners as well as those with deed access
 
01:03:20.029 --> 01:03:20.039 align:start position:0%
informing them of the public hearing on
 
01:03:21.589 --> 01:03:21.599 align:start position:0%
the requested limitations or
 
01:03:23.470 --> 01:03:23.480 align:start position:0%
restrictions in speaking with Chris
 
01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
Casco a lawyer with the hearings Bureau
 
01:03:27.710 --> 01:03:27.720 align:start position:0%
at the department of safety he stated
 
01:03:29.670 --> 01:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
this was an appropriately High
 
01:03:32.430 --> 01:03:32.440 align:start position:0%
bar given the effort required by the
 
01:03:34.510 --> 01:03:34.520 align:start position:0%
department to conduct such a
 
01:03:36.510 --> 01:03:36.520 align:start position:0%
hearing all sides will get an
 
01:03:37.950 --> 01:03:37.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity to present their perspective
 
01:03:40.309 --> 01:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
at the public hearing which will be held
 
01:03:42.069 --> 01:03:42.079 align:start position:0%
near the subject water
 
01:03:45.309 --> 01:03:45.319 align:start position:0%
body and the condition commissioner must
 
01:03:47.390 --> 01:03:47.400 align:start position:0%
take multiple factors into account
 
01:03:51.069 --> 01:03:51.079 align:start position:0%
before approving the petition including
 
01:03:53.549 --> 01:03:53.559 align:start position:0%
impacts on the shore and Wildlife size
 
01:03:54.829 --> 01:03:54.839 align:start position:0%

01:03:57.589 --> 01:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
of the affected Lake areas establish
 
01:04:00.710 --> 01:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
uses of the water body as well as and
 
01:04:02.910 --> 01:04:02.920 align:start position:0%
importantly ensuring access and
 
01:04:06.029 --> 01:04:06.039 align:start position:0%
appropriate use of public water
 
01:04:08.910 --> 01:04:08.920 align:start position:0%
bodies once a decision is made those
 
01:04:11.109 --> 01:04:11.119 align:start position:0%
aggrieved by the Department's ruling can
 
01:04:13.990 --> 01:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
appeal clearly the process is thorough
 
01:04:16.829 --> 01:04:16.839 align:start position:0%

wake

01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
wake
 
01:04:20.430 --> 01:04:20.440 align:start position:0%
surfing in addition to the misconception
 
01:04:22.230 --> 01:04:22.240 align:start position:0%
that a small group of property owners
 
01:04:24.349 --> 01:04:24.359 align:start position:0%
can prohibit wake surfing enjoyed by
 
01:04:26.670 --> 01:04:26.680 align:start position:0%
broad Community the bill also does not
 
01:04:28.990 --> 01:04:29.000 align:start position:0%
ban wake boats it does not attempt to
 
01:04:30.789 --> 01:04:30.799 align:start position:0%
Define these popular watercraft which
 
01:04:32.829 --> 01:04:32.839 align:start position:0%
are used for numerous water activities
 
01:04:34.789 --> 01:04:34.799 align:start position:0%
and instead relies on definitions in
 
01:04:37.589 --> 01:04:37.599 align:start position:0%
existing statute for wake surfing the
 
01:04:40.870 --> 01:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
bill also will not add burden to the to
 
01:04:42.950 --> 01:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
to the burden of Marine Patrol or the
 
01:04:45.109 --> 01:04:45.119 align:start position:0%
department of safety note that the bill
 
01:04:47.029 --> 01:04:47.039 align:start position:0%
does not contain a fiscal note and as
 
01:04:49.109 --> 01:04:49.119 align:start position:0%
mentioned the department has an existing
 
01:04:52.029 --> 01:04:52.039 align:start position:0%
Heroes Bureau for related purposes and
 
01:04:53.589 --> 01:04:53.599 align:start position:0%
the Marine Patrol will simply include
 
01:04:55.470 --> 01:04:55.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement of wak surfing Rec
 
01:04:58.029 --> 01:04:58.039 align:start position:0%
restrictions with existing parols for
 
01:05:00.789 --> 01:05:00.799 align:start position:0%
safety speed and compliance
 
01:05:03.990 --> 01:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
regulations some online testimony raises
 
01:05:05.430 --> 01:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
concerns that this bill will pit
 
01:05:06.950 --> 01:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
neighbor against neighbor over the
 
01:05:09.829 --> 01:05:09.839 align:start position:0%
petition petition process based on my
 
01:05:11.870 --> 01:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
experience animosity between Lake
 
01:05:14.029 --> 01:05:14.039 align:start position:0%
residents currently exists as wake
 
01:05:15.470 --> 01:05:15.480 align:start position:0%
Surfers have little motivation to
 
01:05:17.430 --> 01:05:17.440 align:start position:0%
consider the concerns of others on the
 
01:05:19.710 --> 01:05:19.720 align:start position:0%
lake I predict this bill will have the
 
01:05:21.870 --> 01:05:21.880 align:start position:0%
opposite effect encouraging Advocates
 
01:05:24.230 --> 01:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
and objectors to work together on a
 
01:05:26.390 --> 01:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
compromise to permit responsible wake
 
01:05:29.390 --> 01:05:29.400 align:start position:0%

01:05:32.829 --> 01:05:32.839 align:start position:0%
process the general court has seen
 
01:05:34.309 --> 01:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
numerous wake surfing bills over the
 
01:05:37.789 --> 01:05:37.799 align:start position:0%
last few years HB 137 in 2019
 
01:05:39.190 --> 01:05:39.200 align:start position:0%
established a commission to study wake
 
01:05:41.269 --> 01:05:41.279 align:start position:0%
boats which produced the final report in
 
01:05:46.109 --> 01:05:46.119 align:start position:0%
2020 HB 115 passed in 2021 was based on
 
01:05:47.950 --> 01:05:47.960 align:start position:0%
the recommendations of that commission
 
01:05:50.549 --> 01:05:50.559 align:start position:0%
it defined wake serving and introduced
 
01:05:51.990 --> 01:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
Common Sense safety
 
01:05:54.349 --> 01:05:54.359 align:start position:0%
regulations this bill resulted from
 
01:05:56.309 --> 01:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
another suggestion by the commission
 
01:05:58.150 --> 01:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
members to use the structured hearing
 
01:06:00.630 --> 01:06:00.640 align:start position:0%
process of RSA
 
01:06:03.230 --> 01:06:03.240 align:start position:0%
541a while many hope the responsible WG
 
01:06:05.549 --> 01:06:05.559 align:start position:0%
surfing Outreach and education process
 
01:06:06.710 --> 01:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
promoted by the Marine trades
 
01:06:08.870 --> 01:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
Association would encourage
 
01:06:10.750 --> 01:06:10.760 align:start position:0%
self-regulation by the wake surfing
 
01:06:13.349 --> 01:06:13.359 align:start position:0%
Community limited engagement or other
 
01:06:15.150 --> 01:06:15.160 align:start position:0%
factors have seemingly undercut its

Effectiveness as anecdotal complaints
 
01:06:19.390 --> 01:06:19.400 align:start position:0%
from Lake users continue to
 
01:06:21.470 --> 01:06:21.480 align:start position:0%
increase but what is the harm of wake
 
01:06:23.109 --> 01:06:23.119 align:start position:0%
surfing why can't we just let people
 
01:06:25.510 --> 01:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
enjoy the lake the way they choose
 
01:06:27.069 --> 01:06:27.079 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the side effects of WG
 
01:06:29.549 --> 01:06:29.559 align:start position:0%
surfing can NE negatively impact others
 
01:06:30.430 --> 01:06:30.440 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:06:32.710 --> 01:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
environment restrictions can be
 
01:06:34.829 --> 01:06:34.839 align:start position:0%
appropriate when the activities of one
 
01:06:36.829 --> 01:06:36.839 align:start position:0%

01:06:41.470 --> 01:06:41.480 align:start position:0%
documented in the commission's final

position to identify areas with the

limitations to protect against these
 
01:07:38.990 --> 01:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
threats I'll conclude with a couple of
 
01:07:40.750 --> 01:07:40.760 align:start position:0%
brief personal stories from over the
 
01:07:42.829 --> 01:07:42.839 align:start position:0%
last year we all remember the record
 
01:07:45.549 --> 01:07:45.559 align:start position:0%
rainfall of July um last year
 
01:07:48.190 --> 01:07:48.200 align:start position:0%
2023 after rescuing my neighbors wooden
 
01:07:50.589 --> 01:07:50.599 align:start position:0%
dock from literally floating away and
 
01:07:52.470 --> 01:07:52.480 align:start position:0%
reporting a pondon boat that had floated
 
01:07:54.230 --> 01:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
off its boat lift and down the Lake to
 
01:07:56.430 --> 01:07:56.440 align:start position:0%
collide with another neighbor's dock I
 
01:07:58.789 --> 01:07:58.799 align:start position:0%
was flabbergasted to see irresponsible
 
01:08:02.510 --> 01:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
WG Surfers on the lake pounding already
 
01:08:05.630 --> 01:08:05.640 align:start position:0%
swamp docks and shorelines I have a
 
01:08:07.630 --> 01:08:07.640 align:start position:0%
picture of that if you're interested
 
01:08:09.549 --> 01:08:09.559 align:start position:0%
later in the summer I was canoeing
 
01:08:11.990 --> 01:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
across the narrow lake with my dog
 
01:08:14.670 --> 01:08:14.680 align:start position:0%
riding Lookout when a wake surfing boat
 
01:08:17.430 --> 01:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
exercised their right of passing 150 ft
 
01:08:19.829 --> 01:08:19.839 align:start position:0%
from my bow the next few moments were
 
01:08:21.789 --> 01:08:21.799 align:start position:0%
frantic as I attempted to navigate a
 
01:08:24.070 --> 01:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
4-ot wake keep the canoe's bow pointed
 
01:08:26.590 --> 01:08:26.600 align:start position:0%
into the waves calm my frantic dog and
 
01:08:29.390 --> 01:08:29.400 align:start position:0%
maintain balance to keep us from dumping
 
01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
but this is not about me I have heard
 
01:08:33.510 --> 01:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
from many many others with similar
 
01:08:35.950 --> 01:08:35.960 align:start position:0%
experiences leading me to conclude that
 
01:08:38.229 --> 01:08:38.239 align:start position:0%
Outreach and education alone are
 
01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
insufficient to break the bad habits of
 
01:08:42.990 --> 01:08:43.000 align:start position:0%
those who uh wake surf
 
01:08:45.309 --> 01:08:45.319 align:start position:0%

2010 uh from the city of nsha now a
 
01:09:50.430 --> 01:09:50.440 align:start position:0%
full-time resident in the for almost
 
01:09:53.510 --> 01:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
five years uh in sunap New Hampshire um
 
01:09:57.229 --> 01:09:57.239 align:start position:0%
I I was a member of the 2019 commission
 
01:10:00.030 --> 01:10:00.040 align:start position:0%
to study wake boats and I'm here today I
 
01:10:02.470 --> 01:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
should say I'm here today in opposition
 
01:10:03.990 --> 01:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
to House Bill
 
01:10:08.470 --> 01:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
1301 we did conduct an extensive s uh
 
01:10:11.709 --> 01:10:11.719 align:start position:0%
study over the course of nine months and
 
01:10:15.070 --> 01:10:15.080 align:start position:0%
we found no strong evidence of problems
 
01:10:17.430 --> 01:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
that required legislative correction
 
01:10:20.430 --> 01:10:20.440 align:start position:0%
during that study we studied invasives
 
01:10:22.669 --> 01:10:22.679 align:start position:0%
we studied Wildlife we studied wave
 
01:10:25.750 --> 01:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
action and we studied water
 
01:10:29.310 --> 01:10:29.320 align:start position:0%
quality um the water sport industry
 
01:10:33.070 --> 01:10:33.080 align:start position:0%
Association did recognize that there was
 
01:10:36.790 --> 01:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
a problem with those who dislike the
 
01:10:39.669 --> 01:10:39.679 align:start position:0%
activity and they conducted an extensive
 
01:10:41.470 --> 01:10:41.480 align:start position:0%
public awareness
 
01:10:44.149 --> 01:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
campaign um and that's been done in
 
01:10:45.550 --> 01:10:45.560 align:start position:0%
conjunction with the Department of
 
01:10:48.830 --> 01:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
Safety over the last couple years and uh
 
01:10:51.149 --> 01:10:51.159 align:start position:0%
yet there continues a move to try to
 
01:10:55.110 --> 01:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
Outlaw the sport of wake surfing so what
 
01:10:58.870 --> 01:10:58.880 align:start position:0%
does House Bill 1301 do um the
 
01:11:01.189 --> 01:11:01.199 align:start position:0%
representative who uh sponsored and
 
01:11:04.189 --> 01:11:04.199 align:start position:0%
introduced the bill did say that 25 or
 
01:11:07.870 --> 01:11:07.880 align:start position:0%
more residents or Property Owners of a
 
01:11:11.950 --> 01:11:11.960 align:start position:0%
town that has a lake Pond or a river can
 
01:11:13.990 --> 01:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
petition the department of safety to
 
01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:15.550 align:start position:0%
petition the department of safety to
restrict

01:11:15.550 --> 01:11:15.560 align:start position:0%
restrict
 
01:11:17.870 --> 01:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
activity uh only the abutters are
 
01:11:19.669 --> 01:11:19.679 align:start position:0%
notified and anybody who's more than a
 
01:11:21.669 --> 01:11:21.679 align:start position:0%
quarter of a mile away receives no
 
01:11:24.350 --> 01:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
direct notification so so what you have
 
01:11:28.110 --> 01:11:28.120 align:start position:0%
are the um wishes of a few who might
 
01:11:30.910 --> 01:11:30.920 align:start position:0%
regulate the activity of
 
01:11:33.790 --> 01:11:33.800 align:start position:0%
many does the department have the
 
01:11:36.910 --> 01:11:36.920 align:start position:0%
Personnel to handle the hearings is this
 
01:11:39.910 --> 01:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
in the public interest to
 
01:11:43.550 --> 01:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
have uh restrictions made or is it in
 
01:11:46.430 --> 01:11:46.440 align:start position:0%
the interests of a few New Hampshire has
 
01:11:49.390 --> 01:11:49.400 align:start position:0%
long opposed the expanding of the
 
01:11:52.510 --> 01:11:52.520 align:start position:0%
petition process because it will create
 
01:11:54.990 --> 01:11:55.000 align:start position:0%
a patchwork a regul potion and I do
 
01:11:57.189 --> 01:11:57.199 align:start position:0%
believe it would pet neighbor against
 
01:11:59.790 --> 01:11:59.800 align:start position:0%
neighbor and those on the water versus
 
01:12:02.669 --> 01:12:02.679 align:start position:0%
those off the water the public trust
 
01:12:04.669 --> 01:12:04.679 align:start position:0%
Doctrine which I'm sure you all are
 
01:12:07.110 --> 01:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
aware of ensures that all public
 
01:12:09.030 --> 01:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
waterways in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:12:11.390 --> 01:12:11.400 align:start position:0%
are held in trust for the use and
 
01:12:14.189 --> 01:12:14.199 align:start position:0%
benefit of the people of the state this
 
01:12:17.830 --> 01:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
is done to ensure access to the public
 
01:12:20.189 --> 01:12:20.199 align:start position:0%
to use our Waters
 
01:12:22.669 --> 01:12:22.679 align:start position:0%
reasonably our lakes in New Hampshire
 
01:12:26.470 --> 01:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
are key to the outdoor recreation and
 
01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:27.510 align:start position:0%
are key to the outdoor recreation and
the

01:12:27.510 --> 01:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:12:31.189 --> 01:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
economic economy of this state to
 
01:12:34.629 --> 01:12:34.639 align:start position:0%
restrict access would send the wrong
 
01:12:37.229 --> 01:12:37.239 align:start position:0%
message people are going to wonder if
 
01:12:39.790 --> 01:12:39.800 align:start position:0%
you can restrict one thing now what will
 
01:12:40.750 --> 01:12:40.760 align:start position:0%
it be
 
01:12:42.750 --> 01:12:42.760 align:start position:0%
tomorrow uh and it
 
01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:44.430 align:start position:0%
tomorrow uh and it
may

01:12:44.430 --> 01:12:44.440 align:start position:0%
may
 
01:12:47.110 --> 01:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
uh have people decide to Vacation
 
01:12:50.229 --> 01:12:50.239 align:start position:0%
elsewhere or buy property elsewhere my
 
01:12:53.629 --> 01:12:53.639 align:start position:0%
family personally owns a towboat three
 
01:12:56.430 --> 01:12:56.440 align:start position:0%
Generations enjoy tubing and water
 
01:12:59.830 --> 01:12:59.840 align:start position:0%
skiing and wake surfing on our beautiful
 
01:13:01.470 --> 01:13:01.480 align:start position:0%
Lake sopy in the
 
01:13:05.030 --> 01:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
summer the public awareness campaign has
 
01:13:08.990 --> 01:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
changed our uh Behavior we push
 
01:13:11.430 --> 01:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
ourselves even further from Shore than
 
01:13:15.430 --> 01:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
the 150 fot Rule and we regulate our
 
01:13:19.669 --> 01:13:19.679 align:start position:0%
music uh volumes to restrict access
 
01:13:24.629 --> 01:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
today um I think is premature
 
01:13:26.990 --> 01:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
but what we have observed this last
 
01:13:30.510 --> 01:13:30.520 align:start position:0%
summer uh it was extremely rainy summer
 
01:13:33.189 --> 01:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
there was very little boating activity
 
01:13:35.149 --> 01:13:35.159 align:start position:0%
but we've witnessed over the past few
 
01:13:38.030 --> 01:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
years an increase in violations people
 
01:13:41.550 --> 01:13:41.560 align:start position:0%
who are mostly safe passage coming too
 
01:13:44.110 --> 01:13:44.120 align:start position:0%
close to us my husband was almost hit by
 
01:13:47.350 --> 01:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
a jet skier in the water last year uh
 
01:13:51.310 --> 01:13:51.320 align:start position:0%
after he had fallen um we see very
 
01:13:55.950 --> 01:13:55.960 align:start position:0%
little Marine Patrol on our Lake and if
 
01:13:58.350 --> 01:13:58.360 align:start position:0%
the legislature really wanted to do
 
01:14:01.350 --> 01:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
something then I think it would behoove
 
01:14:04.870 --> 01:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
everyone to get together and look to
 
01:14:07.270 --> 01:14:07.280 align:start position:0%
increase funding for the department so
 
01:14:10.030 --> 01:14:10.040 align:start position:0%
that they can enforce the laws that we
 
01:14:13.110 --> 01:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
have currently before we pass a new
 
01:14:15.790 --> 01:14:15.800 align:start position:0%
law and thank you very
 
01:14:20.470 --> 01:14:20.480 align:start position:0%

representative wolf I didn't recognize
 
01:14:29.149 --> 01:14:29.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:33.790 --> 01:14:33.800 align:start position:0%

anyways

01:14:37.229 --> 01:14:37.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:41.750 --> 01:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
yeah excuse me um thank you for taking
 
01:14:44.550 --> 01:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
my question you uh
 
01:14:48.990 --> 01:14:49.000 align:start position:0%
noted that uh the activities of tubing
 
01:14:52.110 --> 01:14:52.120 align:start position:0%
water skiing and wake surfing correct do
 
01:14:55.070 --> 01:14:55.080 align:start position:0%
you make a distinction
 
01:14:57.070 --> 01:14:57.080 align:start position:0%
within those
 
01:15:00.629 --> 01:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
three um I'm not sure I understand your
 
01:15:03.709 --> 01:15:03.719 align:start position:0%
question do we operate the boat
 
01:15:07.030 --> 01:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
differently based on the three do
 
01:15:10.790 --> 01:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
you accept that there is a
 
01:15:13.750 --> 01:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
distinction of the effect that those
 
01:15:17.709 --> 01:15:17.719 align:start position:0%
three types of activities have on the
 
01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
lake uh I personally don't believe there
 
01:15:25.590 --> 01:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
are a difference certainly um the wake
 
01:15:28.390 --> 01:15:28.400 align:start position:0%
is larger when you're wake
 
01:15:32.709 --> 01:15:32.719 align:start position:0%
surfing but I don't believe that um the
 
01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
overall impact is any
 
01:15:37.590 --> 01:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
different thank
 
01:15:40.629 --> 01:15:40.639 align:start position:0%

commission the bill as you all know as
 
01:16:46.149 --> 01:16:46.159 align:start position:0%
proposed would offer a petition process
 
01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
to regulate the activity of wake surfing
 
01:16:51.790 --> 01:16:51.800 align:start position:0%
on certain water bodies Dees prefers the
 
01:16:54.390 --> 01:16:54.400 align:start position:0%
approach taken terms of regula
 
01:16:57.070 --> 01:16:57.080 align:start position:0%
potentially regulating the activity over
 
01:16:59.110 --> 01:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
the use of certain types of watercraft
 
01:17:01.709 --> 01:17:01.719 align:start position:0%
on water bodies such as wake boats uh we
 
01:17:03.390 --> 01:17:03.400 align:start position:0%
think it's much easier for the safety
 
01:17:05.390 --> 01:17:05.400 align:start position:0%
patrol to also recognize the activity
 
01:17:09.189 --> 01:17:09.199 align:start position:0%
vers um The Vessel Craft um as we've
 
01:17:11.709 --> 01:17:11.719 align:start position:0%
testified in previous years we know that
 
01:17:13.669 --> 01:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
all types of boats can produce small or
 
01:17:15.709 --> 01:17:15.719 align:start position:0%
large waves and that's largely dependent
 
01:17:18.950 --> 01:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
on how they're operated however the uh
 
01:17:21.149 --> 01:17:21.159 align:start position:0%
specific activity of wake surfing uh
 
01:17:24.030 --> 01:17:24.040 align:start position:0%
requires that larger waves be produced
 
01:17:27.070 --> 01:17:27.080 align:start position:0%
in uh in regards to other motorized
 
01:17:29.790 --> 01:17:29.800 align:start position:0%
water sports the larger water wave and
 
01:17:32.390 --> 01:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
the larger waves U associated with the
 
01:17:34.750 --> 01:17:34.760 align:start position:0%
activity presents an environmental risk
 
01:17:36.550 --> 01:17:36.560 align:start position:0%
especially with regards to shoreline
 
01:17:39.669 --> 01:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
erosion and sediment resuspension both
 
01:17:41.470 --> 01:17:41.480 align:start position:0%
which can increase nutrient loading into
 
01:17:42.790 --> 01:17:42.800 align:start position:0%
our surface
 
01:17:46.990 --> 01:17:47.000 align:start position:0%
waters we also know that um wake surfing
 
01:17:49.669 --> 01:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
uh has a potential to introduce exotic
 
01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh invasive species as an additional
 
01:17:53.870 --> 01:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
environmental threat which is associated
 
01:17:56.950 --> 01:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
with the activity because often times in
 
01:17:58.510 --> 01:17:58.520 align:start position:0%
order to do the activity they have to
 
01:18:00.870 --> 01:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
add additional water which is ballast to
 
01:18:04.790 --> 01:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
uh create the waves that they need to
 
01:18:07.590 --> 01:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
Surf DS notes that there have been
 
01:18:10.189 --> 01:18:10.199 align:start position:0%
several recent studies uh that have
 
01:18:11.950 --> 01:18:11.960 align:start position:0%
documented that it's important to
 
01:18:14.709 --> 01:18:14.719 align:start position:0%
consider factors such as the distance to
 
01:18:16.750 --> 01:18:16.760 align:start position:0%
shore which the activity occurs and the
 
01:18:18.910 --> 01:18:18.920 align:start position:0%
depth of the water in which the activity
 
01:18:20.790 --> 01:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
occurs in order to minimize shoreline
 
01:18:24.229 --> 01:18:24.239 align:start position:0%
erosion and sediment suspension
 
01:18:27.310 --> 01:18:27.320 align:start position:0%
specifically the literature uh notes
 
01:18:30.310 --> 01:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
that a 4 to 500 foot setback is needed
 
01:18:33.350 --> 01:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
from shorelines in order to uh create or
 
01:18:36.990 --> 01:18:37.000 align:start position:0%
have a way power equal to a um a
 
01:18:40.030 --> 01:18:40.040 align:start position:0%
motorboat cruising at 150 ft from Shore
 
01:18:42.189 --> 01:18:42.199 align:start position:0%
that's been documented in the literature
 
01:18:44.070 --> 01:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
Additionally the literature supports the
 
01:18:46.510 --> 01:18:46.520 align:start position:0%
idea that um sediment suspension
 
01:18:49.470 --> 01:18:49.480 align:start position:0%
typically occurs at depths of 20 fet or
 
01:18:52.149 --> 01:18:52.159 align:start position:0%
less uh when this activity occurs and
 
01:18:54.790 --> 01:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
that it can lead to a temporary increase
 
01:18:57.550 --> 01:18:57.560 align:start position:0%
in the phosphorus in the water column by
 
01:19:00.590 --> 01:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
20% in conclusion Dees suggests that
 
01:19:02.350 --> 01:19:02.360 align:start position:0%
those factors should be considered
 
01:19:05.430 --> 01:19:05.440 align:start position:0%
should be taken into consideration um in
 
01:19:07.790 --> 01:19:07.800 align:start position:0%
this bill as part of the proposed
 
01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:08.870 align:start position:0%
this bill as part of the proposed
petition

01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
petition
 
01:19:12.590 --> 01:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
process uh so that wake surfing uh can
 
01:19:17.189 --> 01:19:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:21.830 --> 01:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:23.390 align:start position:0%
 
Neils

01:19:23.390 --> 01:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
Neils
 
01:19:25.990 --> 01:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
representative W uh can you cite
 
01:19:30.750 --> 01:19:30.760 align:start position:0%
specific uh documentation for those
 
01:19:33.709 --> 01:19:33.719 align:start position:0%
uh damages that you talk about there's a
 
01:19:36.510 --> 01:19:36.520 align:start position:0%
study I believe from is it
 
01:19:38.510 --> 01:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
Minnesota one of the studies was
 
01:19:40.669 --> 01:19:40.679 align:start position:0%
completed in I think it was 2020
 
01:19:42.709 --> 01:19:42.719 align:start position:0%
University of Minnesota St PA St
 
01:19:44.910 --> 01:19:44.920 align:start position:0%
Anthony's Falls laboratory
 
01:19:48.470 --> 01:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
correct and that produced several
 
01:19:50.270 --> 01:19:50.280 align:start position:0%
outcomes uh some of which are
 
01:19:53.910 --> 01:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
quantitative that you can uh look at the
 
01:19:56.350 --> 01:19:56.360 align:start position:0%
power and energy of waves from various
 
01:20:00.629 --> 01:20:00.639 align:start position:0%
distance based on the watercraft type
 
01:20:06.910 --> 01:20:06.920 align:start position:0%
yes followup followup is it possible to
 
01:20:10.030 --> 01:20:10.040 align:start position:0%
regulate wake
 
01:20:14.550 --> 01:20:14.560 align:start position:0%
boats operating as they
 
01:20:18.030 --> 01:20:18.040 align:start position:0%
do at a diff at various
 
01:20:21.149 --> 01:20:21.159 align:start position:0%
depths how would one do
 
01:20:24.149 --> 01:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
that I think the are you talking about a
 
01:20:25.709 --> 01:20:25.719 align:start position:0%
specific area of a lake based on the
 
01:20:29.229 --> 01:20:29.239 align:start position:0%
depth of the water yes um certainly Maps
 
01:20:30.669 --> 01:20:30.679 align:start position:0%
could be produced we have Beth themetry
 
01:20:32.189 --> 01:20:32.199 align:start position:0%
Maps which are depth maps for all the
 
01:20:36.390 --> 01:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
Lakes um I respect the idea that that
 
01:20:37.870 --> 01:20:37.880 align:start position:0%
would present somewhat of a challenge to
 
01:20:39.430 --> 01:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
the Department of Safety and regulating
 
01:20:44.950 --> 01:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
that um but as the maps were produc or
 
01:20:46.870 --> 01:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
if they were produced certainly the
 
01:20:48.470 --> 01:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
public could be made aware of their
 
01:20:51.270 --> 01:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
presence and the general areas where the
 
01:20:54.950 --> 01:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:56.310 --> 01:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
does that answer your
 
01:21:01.229 --> 01:21:01.239 align:start position:0%
question yes to a degree follow
 
01:21:04.669 --> 01:21:04.679 align:start position:0%
up let me ask first Mr Wolf anyone else
 
01:21:07.070 --> 01:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
have a question of the
 
01:21:09.830 --> 01:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
speaker if not okay one more the
 
01:21:11.510 --> 01:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
representative will would that be
 
01:21:15.189 --> 01:21:15.199 align:start position:0%
similar to what is known as no rafting
 
01:21:18.709 --> 01:21:18.719 align:start position:0%
zones to find an it's def no rafting
 
01:21:19.830 --> 01:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
zone is
 
01:21:23.870 --> 01:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
defined as an area correct could
 
01:21:26.189 --> 01:21:26.199 align:start position:0%
limiting weight boats be defined in a
 
01:21:26.199 --> 01:21:29.910 align:start position:0%
limiting weight boats be defined in a
similar

01:21:29.910 --> 01:21:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:33.070 --> 01:21:33.080 align:start position:0%
manner that I'm C I'm certainly could be
 
01:21:37.110 --> 01:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
defined by a map or on um in writing I
 
01:21:39.510 --> 01:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
think the challenges would be to put
 
01:21:43.669 --> 01:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
that into effect on the water um
 
01:21:46.149 --> 01:21:46.159 align:start position:0%
certainly that's done now with 150 foot
 
01:21:49.750 --> 01:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
rule and um very respectful the Marine
 
01:21:51.350 --> 01:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
Patrol people that understand that
 
01:21:54.189 --> 01:21:54.199 align:start position:0%
distance and are instruments that you
 
01:21:57.030 --> 01:21:57.040 align:start position:0%
know would allow them to to site dis
 
01:21:59.149 --> 01:21:59.159 align:start position:0%
distances that that's one potential way
 
01:22:01.310 --> 01:22:01.320 align:start position:0%
of doing it and again the the presence
 
01:22:03.750 --> 01:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
of maps would give the general public an
 
01:22:06.830 --> 01:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
idea of where the activities are okay to
 
01:22:09.590 --> 01:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
be performed thank you
 
01:22:13.550 --> 01:22:13.560 align:start position:0%
sure yeah anything else for
 
01:22:13.560 --> 01:22:15.629 align:start position:0%
sure yeah anything else for
the

01:22:15.629 --> 01:22:15.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:22:19.270 --> 01:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
speaker representative Ren zul I would
 
01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:20.669 align:start position:0%
speaker representative Ren zul I would
ask

01:22:20.669 --> 01:22:20.679 align:start position:0%
ask
 
01:22:23.430 --> 01:22:23.440 align:start position:0%
uh captain dunlevy
 
01:22:25.629 --> 01:22:25.639 align:start position:0%
uh you heard the some of the questions
 
01:22:30.590 --> 01:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
from uh representative wolf uh would you
 
01:22:32.590 --> 01:22:32.600 align:start position:0%
have anything that might
 
01:22:37.110 --> 01:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
uh bear on that you know questions of
 
01:22:41.270 --> 01:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
uh we might be able to do you know thank
 
01:22:43.149 --> 01:22:43.159 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman again Tim dun Ley with
 
01:22:45.510 --> 01:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
the Department of Safety Marine Patrol
 
01:22:49.350 --> 01:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
um with respect to water depths uh and
 
01:22:51.189 --> 01:22:51.199 align:start position:0%
mapping those are things that certainly
 
01:22:53.070 --> 01:22:53.080 align:start position:0%
are a significant challenge
 
01:22:55.110 --> 01:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
when you have a restriction in place for
 
01:22:56.709 --> 01:22:56.719 align:start position:0%
whatever reason that restriction comes
 
01:22:59.550 --> 01:22:59.560 align:start position:0%
to be uh it's a very specific location
 
01:23:01.750 --> 01:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
or a specific body of water when you
 
01:23:05.550 --> 01:23:05.560 align:start position:0%
start dealing with depths um that every
 
01:23:08.950 --> 01:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
body of water has a depth at say 20 fet
 
01:23:12.390 --> 01:23:12.400 align:start position:0%
is being thrown around today um last
 
01:23:14.149 --> 01:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
summer is a good example what's 20 feet
 
01:23:17.629 --> 01:23:17.639 align:start position:0%
in May at 20 feet in May maybe 25 ft in
 
01:23:20.709 --> 01:23:20.719 align:start position:0%
July depending upon the body of water so
 
01:23:22.550 --> 01:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of fluctuations there's a
 
01:23:25.390 --> 01:23:25.400 align:start position:0%
a lot of variables that go into uh
 
01:23:27.629 --> 01:23:27.639 align:start position:0%
mapping depth and and having a specific
 
01:23:30.149 --> 01:23:30.159 align:start position:0%
depth a restriction based on a specific
 
01:23:34.750 --> 01:23:34.760 align:start position:0%
depth um and certainly the challenge of
 
01:23:39.350 --> 01:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
publicizing maps if you will um for the
 
01:23:43.510 --> 01:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
general public uh is is a
 
01:23:47.070 --> 01:23:47.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:50.229 --> 01:23:50.239 align:start position:0%
you any further questions for Mr
 
01:23:55.590 --> 01:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:58.910 --> 01:23:58.920 align:start position:0%
testimony so those today will know how
 
01:24:02.270 --> 01:24:02.280 align:start position:0%
we're conducting this hearing I have a
 
01:24:04.229 --> 01:24:04.239 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of cards on my desk as you
 
01:24:08.030 --> 01:24:08.040 align:start position:0%
can see we're going to alternate one for
 
01:24:11.229 --> 01:24:11.239 align:start position:0%
one against until we' have equaled those
 
01:24:13.350 --> 01:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
and then I have extra cards then we'll
 
01:24:15.350 --> 01:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
call up the rest of those people but
 
01:24:16.910 --> 01:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to go back and forth so you
 
01:24:18.750 --> 01:24:18.760 align:start position:0%
may wonder why are we calling people
 
01:24:20.750 --> 01:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
like we're calling them so now you know
 
01:24:24.270 --> 01:24:24.280 align:start position:0%
okay so uh speaking in support Andrea
 
01:24:26.830 --> 01:24:26.840 align:start position:0%
Laro of New Hampshire
 
01:24:35.110 --> 01:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:38.910 --> 01:24:38.920 align:start position:0%
you good morning uh I'm Andrea lamro uh
 
01:24:40.709 --> 01:24:40.719 align:start position:0%
president of New Hampshire Lakes thank
 
01:24:43.510 --> 01:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
you for this opportunity to speak uh we
 
01:24:45.750 --> 01:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
are here speaking in support of this
 
01:24:48.470 --> 01:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
bill New Hampshire Lakes we are a
 
01:24:51.950 --> 01:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
Statewide nonprofit um organization our
 
01:24:53.950 --> 01:24:53.960 align:start position:0%
mission is is to restore and preserve
 
01:24:56.109 --> 01:24:56.119 align:start position:0%
the health of our Lakes we represent
 
01:25:00.149 --> 01:25:00.159 align:start position:0%
about 275 local groups and uh a couple
 
01:25:02.310 --> 01:25:02.320 align:start position:0%
thousand uh
 
01:25:04.910 --> 01:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
individuals and again thank you for this
 
01:25:06.669 --> 01:25:06.679 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak we are in support
 
01:25:07.950 --> 01:25:07.960 align:start position:0%
of this bill and I know you're going to
 
01:25:09.590 --> 01:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
have a long morning so I'm really going
 
01:25:12.070 --> 01:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
to get to the point uh representative
 
01:25:14.550 --> 01:25:14.560 align:start position:0%
Darby laid out a number of reasons why
 
01:25:18.750 --> 01:25:18.760 align:start position:0%
we support this bill um I want to say um
 
01:25:20.590 --> 01:25:20.600 align:start position:0%
we believe that the sport of wake
 
01:25:23.830 --> 01:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
surfing can be a very Family Fun
 
01:25:28.189 --> 01:25:28.199 align:start position:0%
inclusive um loow impact sport um when
 
01:25:31.030 --> 01:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
conducted in areas that are away from
 
01:25:34.229 --> 01:25:34.239 align:start position:0%
sensitive ecological um places such as
 
01:25:36.990 --> 01:25:37.000 align:start position:0%
critical fish habitat uh loon nesting
 
01:25:38.870 --> 01:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
and as far away from Shore and as deep
 
01:25:40.390 --> 01:25:40.400 align:start position:0%
as water as
 
01:25:42.629 --> 01:25:42.639 align:start position:0%
possible uh I would like to think that
 
01:25:45.070 --> 01:25:45.080 align:start position:0%
most of us in this room um are on that
 
01:25:47.149 --> 01:25:47.159 align:start position:0%
same page um I know a lot of wake
 
01:25:49.149 --> 01:25:49.159 align:start position:0%
surfing uh in the community a lot of
 
01:25:52.430 --> 01:25:52.440 align:start position:0%
wake Surfers do uh conduct their
 
01:25:54.470 --> 01:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
activities as far away from Shore in as
 
01:25:56.790 --> 01:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
deep as water as possible and you know
 
01:25:59.350 --> 01:25:59.360 align:start position:0%
away from sensitive areas um so I
 
01:26:02.070 --> 01:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
applaud that um that is happening in the
 
01:26:04.270 --> 01:26:04.280 align:start position:0%
community but referencing what
 
01:26:06.750 --> 01:26:06.760 align:start position:0%
representative Darby said um education
 
01:26:08.750 --> 01:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
is not enough um you know there are
 
01:26:10.310 --> 01:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
plenty of people in this room today that
 
01:26:12.870 --> 01:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
wake surf um that aren't educated or
 
01:26:15.470 --> 01:26:15.480 align:start position:0%
don't um comply with the voluntary
 
01:26:19.189 --> 01:26:19.199 align:start position:0%
education program um I live on my family
 
01:26:20.629 --> 01:26:20.639 align:start position:0%
has a place in the lake my husband's
 
01:26:22.270 --> 01:26:22.280 align:start position:0%
family has a place in the lake we do all
 
01:26:24.950 --> 01:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
all sorts of water sports and we do it
 
01:26:27.510 --> 01:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
you know in a responsible manner like
 
01:26:29.669 --> 01:26:29.679 align:start position:0%
most everyone in this room probably but
 
01:26:33.070 --> 01:26:33.080 align:start position:0%
we have myself included have tried to
 
01:26:34.750 --> 01:26:34.760 align:start position:0%
talk with others on the lake that aren't
 
01:26:38.709 --> 01:26:38.719 align:start position:0%
recreating in a responsible way and um
 
01:26:40.229 --> 01:26:40.239 align:start position:0%
I've had instances where I haven't made
 
01:26:42.910 --> 01:26:42.920 align:start position:0%
much progress so I do think that the
 
01:26:45.310 --> 01:26:45.320 align:start position:0%
establishment of a petition process um
 
01:26:47.189 --> 01:26:47.199 align:start position:0%
that is inclusive and includes public
 
01:26:50.229 --> 01:26:50.239 align:start position:0%
hearing like we do for other activities
 
01:26:52.750 --> 01:26:52.760 align:start position:0%
on the lake can be an opportunity Unity
 
01:26:54.830 --> 01:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
to actually bring Community together to
 
01:26:57.229 --> 01:26:57.239 align:start position:0%
have to bring wake Surfers and non-w
 
01:26:59.270 --> 01:26:59.280 align:start position:0%
Surfers together to have more Community
 
01:27:01.350 --> 01:27:01.360 align:start position:0%
conversations these conversations are
 
01:27:02.790 --> 01:27:02.800 align:start position:0%
already happening in communities but
 
01:27:05.109 --> 01:27:05.119 align:start position:0%
they need to be happening more um so I
 
01:27:07.270 --> 01:27:07.280 align:start position:0%
do believe that this could help um no
 
01:27:08.870 --> 01:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
one wants regulation at the end of the
 
01:27:11.510 --> 01:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
day and hopefully that this having the
 
01:27:13.910 --> 01:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
potential for this to exist this you
 
01:27:15.550 --> 01:27:15.560 align:start position:0%
know a petition and a regulation to
 
01:27:18.109 --> 01:27:18.119 align:start position:0%
exist um will encourage folks to work
 
01:27:21.109 --> 01:27:21.119 align:start position:0%
more closely together my final Point um
 
01:27:22.790 --> 01:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
that I wanted to make is there's um we
 
01:27:25.030 --> 01:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
are supportive of this bill because it
 
01:27:26.870 --> 01:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
is protective of water quality and
 
01:27:28.310 --> 01:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
ecological health and there's been a
 
01:27:29.990 --> 01:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
number of speakers thus far who have
 
01:27:32.470 --> 01:27:32.480 align:start position:0%
reference the growing body of studies
 
01:27:33.990 --> 01:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
talking about the impacts of the
 
01:27:36.270 --> 01:27:36.280 align:start position:0%
activity of wake surfing in Shallow
 
01:27:39.270 --> 01:27:39.280 align:start position:0%
close to shore in sensitive areas on on
 
01:27:42.510 --> 01:27:42.520 align:start position:0%
the health and quality and um I do have
 
01:27:44.390 --> 01:27:44.400 align:start position:0%
a study a very nice literature review
 
01:27:47.910 --> 01:27:47.920 align:start position:0%
that summarizes um a handful of studies
 
01:27:49.629 --> 01:27:49.639 align:start position:0%
um and I'm happy to I have one printed
 
01:27:51.229 --> 01:27:51.239 align:start position:0%
copy here I'm happy to provide it or
 
01:27:53.470 --> 01:27:53.480 align:start position:0%
email the uh committee afterwards with a
 
01:27:55.350 --> 01:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
link to this literature
 
01:27:58.189 --> 01:27:58.199 align:start position:0%
review if you email it with an
 
01:28:00.109 --> 01:28:00.119 align:start position:0%
attachment I think that would be great I
 
01:28:01.950 --> 01:28:01.960 align:start position:0%
and everybody will get it well thank you
 
01:28:03.750 --> 01:28:03.760 align:start position:0%

01:28:30.790 --> 01:28:30.800 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone uh my last name is
 
01:28:33.229 --> 01:28:33.239 align:start position:0%
Wally for the record thank you um just
 
01:28:34.910 --> 01:28:34.920 align:start position:0%
want to point out two quick things about
 
01:28:38.629 --> 01:28:38.639 align:start position:0%
WG surfing um first I think the idea
 
01:28:40.070 --> 01:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
that wake surfing boats need to have
 
01:28:42.229 --> 01:28:42.239 align:start position:0%
large wakes is a
 
01:28:44.390 --> 01:28:44.400 align:start position:0%
misconception wake surfing started back
 
01:28:47.950 --> 01:28:47.960 align:start position:0%
in the 1950s with 12 foot surfboards and
 
01:28:49.830 --> 01:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
you don't need a big wake you just need
 
01:28:52.950 --> 01:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
a safe boat designed in board boat to
 
01:28:55.550 --> 01:28:55.560 align:start position:0%
Surf so in turn some of these challenges
 
01:28:58.870 --> 01:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
will be eliminating people off of B ways
 
01:29:01.590 --> 01:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
that have reasonably small wakes that
 
01:29:03.109 --> 01:29:03.119 align:start position:0%
use a boat that they can water ski
 
01:29:05.510 --> 01:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
behind and do all these different things
 
01:29:08.310 --> 01:29:08.320 align:start position:0%
and also too water depth is a critical
 
01:29:12.030 --> 01:29:12.040 align:start position:0%
element surfing you can't surf in water
 
01:29:14.070 --> 01:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
typically less than 15 feet it's just
 
01:29:16.870 --> 01:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
the wave doesn't work so you wouldn't be
 
01:29:18.669 --> 01:29:18.679 align:start position:0%
able to Surf anyways so you wouldn't go
 
01:29:19.910 --> 01:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
into those protected areas that people
 
01:29:21.750 --> 01:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
are so concerned about so just want to
 
01:29:24.950 --> 01:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
point that out up front so good morning

01:30:24.550 --> 01:30:24.560 align:start position:0%
there was definitely an impacted and

also happen it

will when will these hearings take place
 
01:31:12.830 --> 01:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
during the summer when people are around
 
01:31:14.270 --> 01:31:14.280 align:start position:0%

and won't have a say in the matter how
 
01:31:20.229 --> 01:31:20.239 align:start position:0%
will boers learn the process what will
 
01:31:21.270 --> 01:31:21.280 align:start position:0%
happen to families who have made
 
01:31:22.790 --> 01:31:22.800 align:start position:0%
significant investments in their boating
 
01:31:24.350 --> 01:31:24.360 align:start position:0%
products with their families will they
 
01:31:25.709 --> 01:31:25.719 align:start position:0%
have to sell that
 
01:31:28.430 --> 01:31:28.440 align:start position:0%

due to inexperience do not operate bubat

best practices of the New Hampshire Lake
 
01:31:57.790 --> 01:31:57.800 align:start position:0%
responsibility campaign now if you went
 
01:31:59.950 --> 01:31:59.960 align:start position:0%
to boat ramps all over the lake you'll
 
01:32:03.189 --> 01:32:03.199 align:start position:0%
see about a 2 by3 foot sign that says
 
01:32:05.070 --> 01:32:05.080 align:start position:0%

01:32:07.590 --> 01:32:07.600 align:start position:0%

and over again be respectful of your
 
01:32:14.229 --> 01:32:14.239 align:start position:0%
neighbors that's been a massive campaign
 
01:32:17.390 --> 01:32:17.400 align:start position:0%
we've sent out um tens of thousands of
 
01:32:19.470 --> 01:32:19.480 align:start position:0%
dollars have been spent on Advertising
 
01:32:21.870 --> 01:32:21.880 align:start position:0%

01:32:24.149 --> 01:32:24.159 align:start position:0%
many marinas has a hang tag on those
 
01:32:25.709 --> 01:32:25.719 align:start position:0%

water
 
01:32:38.830 --> 01:32:38.840 align:start position:0%
Zacks we also have a new bill being cify
 
01:32:42.030 --> 01:32:42.040 align:start position:0%
with the Senate s SP 431 which really
 
01:32:45.310 --> 01:32:45.320 align:start position:0%
basically focuses on the Marine trades
 
01:32:48.070 --> 01:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
acts and also the Wake responsibly
 
01:32:50.470 --> 01:32:50.480 align:start position:0%
campaign into focusing on driving people
 
01:32:52.950 --> 01:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
to understand this is the best practices
 
01:32:55.229 --> 01:32:55.239 align:start position:0%
and this will become hopefully a
 
01:32:57.750 --> 01:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
law we also recognize too that the
 
01:32:59.870 --> 01:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
immense challenges that could be opposed
 
01:33:03.030 --> 01:33:03.040 align:start position:0%
on our M Patrol 60 to 70 officers was
 
01:33:04.910 --> 01:33:04.920 align:start position:0%
pretty much the norm 15 or years ago I
 
01:33:06.990 --> 01:33:07.000 align:start position:0%
think Tim can back that up today we're
 
01:33:09.550 --> 01:33:09.560 align:start position:0%
down to 25 or less it's going to create
 
01:33:11.310 --> 01:33:11.320 align:start position:0%
immense amount of strain on having to
 
01:33:13.430 --> 01:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
add additional laws into place and
 
01:33:16.990 --> 01:33:17.000 align:start position:0%
potential bans if I'm a consumer and I'm
 
01:33:18.750 --> 01:33:18.760 align:start position:0%
going to take my boat on vacation from
 
01:33:20.950 --> 01:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and I have a rental home I
 
01:33:23.070 --> 01:33:23.080 align:start position:0%
take my boat to the lake I show up and
 
01:33:24.430 --> 01:33:24.440 align:start position:0%
next thing I know I can't use my boat
 
01:33:26.709 --> 01:33:26.719 align:start position:0%
the way I'm choosing to how will I ever
 
01:33:29.950 --> 01:33:29.960 align:start position:0%
know that is my airbn V or my VRBO or my
 
01:33:31.350 --> 01:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
rental going to tell me there's no
 
01:33:32.830 --> 01:33:32.840 align:start position:0%
weight something on this Lake that's
 
01:33:34.070 --> 01:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
going to affect economics that's going
 
01:33:36.189 --> 01:33:36.199 align:start position:0%
to affect rental costs and it's going to
 
01:33:41.830 --> 01:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:44.189 --> 01:33:44.199 align:start position:0%
concern I like to also look at the
 
01:33:46.790 --> 01:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
environment which as many New Hampshire
 
01:33:48.390 --> 01:33:48.400 align:start position:0%
Brees Association
 
01:33:51.109 --> 01:33:51.119 align:start position:0%
members we're on the water the water is
 
01:33:53.350 --> 01:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
our environment to make having Sals and
 
01:33:55.510 --> 01:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
selling boats it's important to us but I
 
01:33:57.750 --> 01:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
want to point out that cob bacteria
 
01:34:00.310 --> 01:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
blooms happen on both bodies of water
 
01:34:03.390 --> 01:34:03.400 align:start position:0%
with boats and without this year it's
 
01:34:05.470 --> 01:34:05.480 align:start position:0%
been documented Aquatic and vasive
 
01:34:07.350 --> 01:34:07.360 align:start position:0%
species can be carried into bodies of
 
01:34:10.149 --> 01:34:10.159 align:start position:0%
water not just by boats trailers have
 
01:34:12.109 --> 01:34:12.119 align:start position:0%
water that go into the frames and they
 
01:34:14.590 --> 01:34:14.600 align:start position:0%
can carry that water from Lake to Lake
 
01:34:17.790 --> 01:34:17.800 align:start position:0%
canoes kayaks paddlecraft Ducks geese
 
01:34:19.629 --> 01:34:19.639 align:start position:0%
fishing gear even scuba equipment can
 
01:34:22.310 --> 01:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
carry C or excuse me aquatic evasive
 
01:34:23.709 --> 01:34:23.719 align:start position:0%

01:34:24.870 --> 01:34:24.880 align:start position:0%
it's not properly
 
01:34:27.030 --> 01:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
cleaned sediment displacements can
 
01:34:29.390 --> 01:34:29.400 align:start position:0%
happen it can't just it's not just from
 
01:34:31.910 --> 01:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
waser boats people swimming people
 
01:34:34.790 --> 01:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
walking on the bottom anchoring trolling
 
01:34:37.510 --> 01:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
through shallow water fishing even ice
 
01:34:40.070 --> 01:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
prev even ice prevention equipment such
 
01:34:42.750 --> 01:34:42.760 align:start position:0%
as aquatherm and bubblers and not to
 
01:34:47.229 --> 01:34:47.239 align:start position:0%
mention wind ice and water waves that's
 
01:34:49.790 --> 01:34:49.800 align:start position:0%
Silver S Maro we have a large Beach and
 
01:34:52.189 --> 01:34:52.199 align:start position:0%
every year I look at the ice damage that
 
01:34:54.109 --> 01:34:54.119 align:start position:0%
just pounds on our beach and pushes it
 
01:34:56.229 --> 01:34:56.239 align:start position:0%
all up and as we spend about two or
 
01:34:58.229 --> 01:34:58.239 align:start position:0%
three days typically out with a tractor
 
01:34:59.910 --> 01:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
smoothing that all out best we can
 
01:35:02.510 --> 01:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
because it's pushed the ice back so far
 
01:35:04.350 --> 01:35:04.360 align:start position:0%
onto our Shoreline it's even sometimes
 
01:35:06.430 --> 01:35:06.440 align:start position:0%
damaged our
 
01:35:08.870 --> 01:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
lawn to ban and restrict is not the
 
01:35:10.830 --> 01:35:10.840 align:start position:0%
solution we really need to focus on
 
01:35:12.510 --> 01:35:12.520 align:start position:0%
education and I think that's the most
 
01:35:14.910 --> 01:35:14.920 align:start position:0%
important thing having people understand
 
01:35:17.109 --> 01:35:17.119 align:start position:0%
what is a reasonable limit offshore
 
01:35:18.550 --> 01:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
being respectful of our neighbors that's
 
01:35:19.870 --> 01:35:19.880 align:start position:0%
really the New Hampshire way that's what
 
01:35:21.830 --> 01:35:21.840 align:start position:0%
we've always done and I can tell you
 
01:35:23.709 --> 01:35:23.719 align:start position:0%
that everyone on a leg typically knows
 
01:35:25.830 --> 01:35:25.840 align:start position:0%
somebody else on a leg and I know this
 
01:35:27.229 --> 01:35:27.239 align:start position:0%
been situations in the past where it's
 
01:35:28.910 --> 01:35:28.920 align:start position:0%
been contentious and challenging but we
 
01:35:30.310 --> 01:35:30.320 align:start position:0%
need to work together to find a better
 
01:35:32.790 --> 01:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
solution thank you for your
 
01:35:36.070 --> 01:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
time thank you any questions for our
 
01:35:39.470 --> 01:35:39.480 align:start position:0%
speaker representative
 
01:35:42.430 --> 01:35:42.440 align:start position:0%
Bale um yeah I just have a question
 
01:35:42.440 --> 01:35:44.910 align:start position:0%
Bale um yeah I just have a question
excuse

01:35:44.910 --> 01:35:44.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:50.189 --> 01:35:50.199 align:start position:0%
me a quick question about um how will a
 
01:35:53.229 --> 01:35:53.239 align:start position:0%
boter know whether or or not they can go
 
01:35:57.270 --> 01:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
on a certain Lake um don't boers already
 
01:35:58.750 --> 01:35:58.760 align:start position:0%
research where they're going to go to
 
01:36:01.189 --> 01:36:01.199 align:start position:0%
see if they can wake surf there or not
 
01:36:04.470 --> 01:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
never been an issue you can wake surf on
 
01:36:06.189 --> 01:36:06.199 align:start position:0%
any Lake mean other than the fact that
 
01:36:08.750 --> 01:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
you know in the situation based off a
 
01:36:10.910 --> 01:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
current law of 150 ft from Shore you
 
01:36:13.590 --> 01:36:13.600 align:start position:0%
imagine that's double so if if a body of
 
01:36:15.189 --> 01:36:15.199 align:start position:0%
water is less than 300 feet wide you
 
01:36:17.669 --> 01:36:17.679 align:start position:0%
can't travel down that body of water at
 
01:36:20.510 --> 01:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
speed you have to go at an idle speed so
 
01:36:21.790 --> 01:36:21.800 align:start position:0%
there's there's currently no
 
01:36:25.149 --> 01:36:25.159 align:start position:0%
restrictions or bans of any kind of wake
 
01:36:27.189 --> 01:36:27.199 align:start position:0%
surfing or wake surfing boats does that
 
01:36:29.990 --> 01:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
answer your question yes thank you
 
01:36:33.629 --> 01:36:33.639 align:start position:0%
okay representative L
 
01:36:36.229 --> 01:36:36.239 align:start position:0%
montin morning thank you for taking my
 
01:36:39.430 --> 01:36:39.440 align:start position:0%
question um well given that there may be
 
01:36:42.669 --> 01:36:42.679 align:start position:0%
some Lakes where it's impossible to
 
01:36:45.270 --> 01:36:45.280 align:start position:0%
follow the safe guidelines for Wake
 
01:36:48.030 --> 01:36:48.040 align:start position:0%
serving State guidelines state state
 
01:36:51.870 --> 01:36:51.880 align:start position:0%
guidelines for what would be a safe way
 
01:36:56.629 --> 01:36:56.639 align:start position:0%
to Waker that some Lakes may make that
 
01:36:59.229 --> 01:36:59.239 align:start position:0%
impossible um couldn't you see the the
 
01:37:02.910 --> 01:37:02.920 align:start position:0%
benefit perhaps of that Lake
 
01:37:05.830 --> 01:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
should the community petition and are
 
01:37:08.669 --> 01:37:08.679 align:start position:0%
successful to say that wake boarding
 
01:37:11.270 --> 01:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
would not be allow wake surfing would
 
01:37:13.510 --> 01:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
not be allowed because it would be
 
01:37:16.870 --> 01:37:16.880 align:start position:0%
impossible to do it in a safe
 
01:37:19.470 --> 01:37:19.480 align:start position:0%
way I think there always a safe way
 
01:37:20.830 --> 01:37:20.840 align:start position:0%
whether it's legal or not I think is a
 
01:37:22.950 --> 01:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
bigger question question you know
 
01:37:26.189 --> 01:37:26.199 align:start position:0%
um the challenges that that concern me
 
01:37:28.870 --> 01:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
is that we we turn into these elitist
 
01:37:31.149 --> 01:37:31.159 align:start position:0%
private Lakes which is exactly what we
 
01:37:32.590 --> 01:37:32.600 align:start position:0%
don't do in New Hampshire we've always
 
01:37:35.629 --> 01:37:35.639 align:start position:0%
been a place for for uh people to come
 
01:37:37.310 --> 01:37:37.320 align:start position:0%
and enjoy themselves I mean that's why
 
01:37:39.070 --> 01:37:39.080 align:start position:0%
we move here in liia right I mean I know
 
01:37:40.270 --> 01:37:40.280 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of people that have moved
 
01:37:42.470 --> 01:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
from Southern States and in retirement
 
01:37:44.109 --> 01:37:44.119 align:start position:0%
when their jobs are no longer at
 
01:37:45.950 --> 01:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
employment and now too with through
 
01:37:48.270 --> 01:37:48.280 align:start position:0%
covid with being able to remote in from
 
01:37:50.030 --> 01:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
work and you choose to move to New
 
01:37:51.669 --> 01:37:51.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because it's a great place to
 
01:37:54.550 --> 01:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
live and recreate um I think people want
 
01:37:56.109 --> 01:37:56.119 align:start position:0%
to be on buys of water that they can
 
01:37:58.109 --> 01:37:58.119 align:start position:0%
choose the activity that they want to do
 
01:38:01.470 --> 01:38:01.480 align:start position:0%
I think it's a a disappointing thing
 
01:38:04.870 --> 01:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
when you have to find out that 25 people
 
01:38:07.149 --> 01:38:07.159 align:start position:0%
on your Lake petition to potentially ban
 
01:38:11.430 --> 01:38:11.440 align:start position:0%
whatever you love if I found 25 people
 
01:38:13.470 --> 01:38:13.480 align:start position:0%
on my Lake that wanted to thought that
 
01:38:13.480 --> 01:38:14.189 align:start position:0%
on my Lake that wanted to thought that
you

01:38:14.189 --> 01:38:14.199 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:38:17.669 --> 01:38:17.679 align:start position:0%
know canoes were dangerous out past 150
 
01:38:19.830 --> 01:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
ft from Shore because that's in a you
 
01:38:22.990 --> 01:38:23.000 align:start position:0%
know higher level speed of voting I
 
01:38:25.390 --> 01:38:25.400 align:start position:0%
guess I kind of think about would I
 
01:38:28.070 --> 01:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
bicycle down i93 it's not really
 
01:38:29.589 --> 01:38:29.599 align:start position:0%
appropriate you know but that that's the
 
01:38:31.510 --> 01:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
same kind of thing we're talking about
 
01:38:36.430 --> 01:38:36.440 align:start position:0%
potentially petiti a petition plan to
 
01:38:38.950 --> 01:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
potentially restrict someone from doing
 
01:38:43.589 --> 01:38:43.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:46.950 --> 01:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
Activity thank you representative
 
01:38:49.910 --> 01:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
will thank you for your testimony you're
 
01:38:52.470 --> 01:38:52.480 align:start position:0%
welcome um you said something at the
 
01:38:56.030 --> 01:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
very beginning about 15 feet depth yeah
 
01:38:59.270 --> 01:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
typically the way boats are designed
 
01:39:01.270 --> 01:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
wave surfing boats need some what they
 
01:39:02.430 --> 01:39:02.440 align:start position:0%
call it kind of
 
01:39:06.390 --> 01:39:06.400 align:start position:0%
push and a wave typically doesn't have
 
01:39:10.350 --> 01:39:10.360 align:start position:0%
that strength or power if it's not in a
 
01:39:13.149 --> 01:39:13.159 align:start position:0%
certain depth of water so it has to be
 
01:39:15.070 --> 01:39:15.080 align:start position:0%
at least 15 feet to physically work
 
01:39:17.550 --> 01:39:17.560 align:start position:0%
typically yes to work effectively yes
 
01:39:18.830 --> 01:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
and that may be on different boats I
 
01:39:20.870 --> 01:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
mean they're not all the same so thank
 
01:39:23.189 --> 01:39:23.199 align:start position:0%
you you're welcome
 
01:39:27.350 --> 01:39:27.360 align:start position:0%
so can I continue Along on this another
 
01:39:29.709 --> 01:39:29.719 align:start position:0%
question okay thank
 
01:39:33.470 --> 01:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
you I've been a boater for over 60 years
 
01:39:37.070 --> 01:39:37.080 align:start position:0%
on sun water skiing Aqua planing in the
 
01:39:39.950 --> 01:39:39.960 align:start position:0%
old days sure
 
01:39:44.149 --> 01:39:44.159 align:start position:0%
Etc the wake boards wake boats have come
 
01:39:44.159 --> 01:39:45.229 align:start position:0%
Etc the wake boards wake boats have come
in

01:39:45.229 --> 01:39:45.239 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:39:48.870 --> 01:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
recently and you've just specified that
 
01:39:52.470 --> 01:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
they need a certain depth would you and
 
01:39:58.270 --> 01:39:58.280 align:start position:0%
your group be cooperative to
 
01:40:01.270 --> 01:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
controlling or
 
01:40:04.350 --> 01:40:04.360 align:start position:0%
recommending a depth map where those
 
01:40:07.629 --> 01:40:07.639 align:start position:0%
boats could effectively go you've just
 
01:40:10.950 --> 01:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
said they need 15
 
01:40:15.070 --> 01:40:15.080 align:start position:0%
feet so we draw a map and commissioner
 
01:40:19.229 --> 01:40:19.239 align:start position:0%
dun Levy gets more money to uh enforce
 
01:40:22.629 --> 01:40:22.639 align:start position:0%
it but we have those type of things now
 
01:40:27.030 --> 01:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
sure and I think the problem is depth
 
01:40:29.189 --> 01:40:29.199 align:start position:0%
and the wave that is created by the
 
01:40:29.199 --> 01:40:31.510 align:start position:0%
and the wave that is created by the
shallow

01:40:31.510 --> 01:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
shallow
 
01:40:34.589 --> 01:40:34.599 align:start position:0%
depth I I have some concerns about that
 
01:40:37.950 --> 01:40:37.960 align:start position:0%
in that I I don't know how you
 
01:40:40.430 --> 01:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
properly get the information out to the
 
01:40:43.709 --> 01:40:43.719 align:start position:0%
public number one number two I think the
 
01:40:47.709 --> 01:40:47.719 align:start position:0%
minute you put a more congested number
 
01:40:51.109 --> 01:40:51.119 align:start position:0%
of people into a hight trffic area it
 
01:40:53.030 --> 01:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
poses danger you know like I have a
 
01:40:56.350 --> 01:40:56.360 align:start position:0%
10-year-old daughter and there's moments
 
01:40:58.669 --> 01:40:58.679 align:start position:0%
where she wants to go wake serving and I
 
01:41:00.709 --> 01:41:00.719 align:start position:0%
have to tell her no because it's either
 
01:41:03.189 --> 01:41:03.199 align:start position:0%
too busy on the water it's the wrong
 
01:41:04.750 --> 01:41:04.760 align:start position:0%
time of the day there's a lot of things
 
01:41:06.990 --> 01:41:07.000 align:start position:0%
as a parent that I have to think about
 
01:41:09.830 --> 01:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
and if in a certain situation
 
01:41:12.270 --> 01:41:12.280 align:start position:0%
where hypothetically if there was a lake
 
01:41:14.750 --> 01:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
that was very shallow and had one
 
01:41:18.070 --> 01:41:18.080 align:start position:0%
designed spot that was set up for depth
 
01:41:19.430 --> 01:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
of water that was appropriate for
 
01:41:21.669 --> 01:41:21.679 align:start position:0%
surfing in a lot of people's eyes
 
01:41:23.910 --> 01:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
and then that was in the heart of the
 
01:41:25.790 --> 01:41:25.800 align:start position:0%
lake and there was 10 people out there
 
01:41:27.870 --> 01:41:27.880 align:start position:0%
WG surfing and you had that one person
 
01:41:29.990 --> 01:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
who tap blows off which has happened in
 
01:41:33.870 --> 01:41:33.880 align:start position:0%
the past um changing the stereo texting
 
01:41:36.870 --> 01:41:36.880 align:start position:0%
on their phone whatever and they drive
 
01:41:38.629 --> 01:41:38.639 align:start position:0%
through a congested area of water
 
01:41:40.790 --> 01:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
similar to what happened to Mr Price and
 
01:41:43.270 --> 01:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
a boat Travels by them at a close range
 
01:41:45.430 --> 01:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
and it could cause significant damage or
 
01:41:48.350 --> 01:41:48.360 align:start position:0%
injury to somebody or a boat um I think
 
01:41:51.070 --> 01:41:51.080 align:start position:0%
that's why people make choices to surf
 
01:41:52.950 --> 01:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
in areas that they feel is
 
01:41:55.030 --> 01:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate environmentally speaking
 
01:41:56.950 --> 01:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
because we all actively use these
 
01:41:59.310 --> 01:41:59.320 align:start position:0%
waterways we're not Reckless people we
 
01:42:01.070 --> 01:42:01.080 align:start position:0%
recognize that a lot of us have homes on
 
01:42:02.470 --> 01:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
these same shorelines and most of the
 
01:42:04.229 --> 01:42:04.239 align:start position:0%
time if I take my daughter surfing I'm
 
01:42:05.470 --> 01:42:05.480 align:start position:0%
going in front of my mother's house
 
01:42:07.070 --> 01:42:07.080 align:start position:0%
because she wants to see the kid
 
01:42:12.070 --> 01:42:12.080 align:start position:0%
surf so um I think it's just there's
 
01:42:14.550 --> 01:42:14.560 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences that I think can
 
01:42:18.589 --> 01:42:18.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:20.390 --> 01:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
everything thank you sorry didn't answer
 
01:42:22.109 --> 01:42:22.119 align:start position:0%
your question abolutely
 
01:42:25.629 --> 01:42:25.639 align:start position:0%
any other questions for our speaker
 
01:42:28.189 --> 01:42:28.199 align:start position:0%
representative R thank you Mr chair and
 
01:42:30.870 --> 01:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr W for taking my question
 
01:42:33.109 --> 01:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
you made a comment earlier that I wanted
 
01:42:36.870 --> 01:42:36.880 align:start position:0%
to explore um and correct me if I got it
 
01:42:41.229 --> 01:42:41.239 align:start position:0%
wrong but the current 150 fet from Shore
 
01:42:44.830 --> 01:42:44.840 align:start position:0%
um do you think wake boats have the same
 
01:42:47.189 --> 01:42:47.199 align:start position:0%
impact on Shore at that distance as
 
01:42:47.199 --> 01:42:49.070 align:start position:0%
impact on Shore at that distance as
other

01:42:49.070 --> 01:42:49.080 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:42:51.470 --> 01:42:51.480 align:start position:0%
boats I think that they do and through
 
01:42:52.870 --> 01:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
studies we found that they have a
 
01:42:55.950 --> 01:42:55.960 align:start position:0%
similar impact um I don't recall the
 
01:42:57.990 --> 01:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
study exactly but when we were studying
 
01:43:00.589 --> 01:43:00.599 align:start position:0%
um the definition of wake surf boats
 
01:43:02.470 --> 01:43:02.480 align:start position:0%
there was a study I believe his name was
 
01:43:05.750 --> 01:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
Kurt or Kirk gouty and he was an MIT
 
01:43:07.430 --> 01:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
Professor he did a big study in Florida
 
01:43:09.070 --> 01:43:09.080 align:start position:0%
and they had sticks in the water and
 
01:43:10.910 --> 01:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
they had boats traveling at certain
 
01:43:13.790 --> 01:43:13.800 align:start position:0%
speeds and different weights and and
 
01:43:16.470 --> 01:43:16.480 align:start position:0%
they were able to document the level of
 
01:43:19.629 --> 01:43:19.639 align:start position:0%
the water as it passed by these sticks
 
01:43:21.270 --> 01:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
and showed that
 
01:43:24.030 --> 01:43:24.040 align:start position:0%
a a surfing boat or the wake surf
 
01:43:26.990 --> 01:43:27.000 align:start position:0%
activity 200 feet from Shore had an
 
01:43:29.709 --> 01:43:29.719 align:start position:0%
exceptionally similar impact of a
 
01:43:31.550 --> 01:43:31.560 align:start position:0%
traditional boat at a similar range
 
01:43:36.030 --> 01:43:36.040 align:start position:0%
which is why Senate bill um Senate Bill
 
01:43:38.270 --> 01:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
431 is something that we're so focused
 
01:43:40.229 --> 01:43:40.239 align:start position:0%
on trying to improve and trying to bring
 
01:43:42.750 --> 01:43:42.760 align:start position:0%
the light okay follow up Mr chair you
 
01:43:45.990 --> 01:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned 250 feet but to but in New
 
01:43:48.830 --> 01:43:48.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's 150 that's safe passage
 
01:43:49.990 --> 01:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
so we recognize that there's an
 
01:43:51.470 --> 01:43:51.480 align:start position:0%
improvement that could be made by
 
01:43:55.510 --> 01:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
extending that further along okay so um
 
01:43:58.990 --> 01:43:59.000 align:start position:0%
because I I have a place at a lake and
 
01:44:01.149 --> 01:44:01.159 align:start position:0%
there was a wake booat that went by my
 
01:44:02.589 --> 01:44:02.599 align:start position:0%
property it was the only boat on the
 
01:44:05.709 --> 01:44:05.719 align:start position:0%
lake sure totally swamped the shore sure
 
01:44:07.390 --> 01:44:07.400 align:start position:0%
so I'm wondering when you made your
 
01:44:10.950 --> 01:44:10.960 align:start position:0%
comments about the um rights of people
 
01:44:13.070 --> 01:44:13.080 align:start position:0%
to recreate on a lake and the investment
 
01:44:14.550 --> 01:44:14.560 align:start position:0%
they've made on the boats I mean I'm
 
01:44:16.950 --> 01:44:16.960 align:start position:0%
there okay I enjoy it too but do you
 
01:44:18.830 --> 01:44:18.840 align:start position:0%
think that should take presidence over
 
01:44:21.229 --> 01:44:21.239 align:start position:0%
the Environmental Protection of the
 
01:44:23.310 --> 01:44:23.320 align:start position:0%
shoreline no and I think that's why the
 
01:44:25.189 --> 01:44:25.199 align:start position:0%
200 foot setback is appropriate and I
 
01:44:27.750 --> 01:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
think too you know
 
01:44:29.910 --> 01:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
um I think it really comes down to the
 
01:44:31.470 --> 01:44:31.480 align:start position:0%
individual you know like if myself you
 
01:44:33.270 --> 01:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
know I have neighbors that tube and
 
01:44:34.870 --> 01:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes they're kind of Reckless and
 
01:44:36.070 --> 01:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
there having fun and I recognize it's
 
01:44:37.270 --> 01:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
the weekend and they're trying to have
 
01:44:40.310 --> 01:44:40.320 align:start position:0%
their kids have a good time um I made a
 
01:44:42.189 --> 01:44:42.199 align:start position:0%
point to cruise out there and say Hey
 
01:44:44.870 --> 01:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
you know maybe we could go not in circle
 
01:44:46.750 --> 01:44:46.760 align:start position:0%
so much and go a little bit deeper out
 
01:44:49.950 --> 01:44:49.960 align:start position:0%
or go in a different spot um I've also
 
01:44:53.270 --> 01:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
had um um a boat go by my mother's house
 
01:44:56.790 --> 01:44:56.800 align:start position:0%
and it literally snapped her dock lines
 
01:44:58.430 --> 01:44:58.440 align:start position:0%
and the dock lines weren't old you know
 
01:45:01.149 --> 01:45:01.159 align:start position:0%
they were 38 double braided dock lines
 
01:45:03.510 --> 01:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
and she called me kind of in a panic and
 
01:45:06.510 --> 01:45:06.520 align:start position:0%
said hey uh one of the boat lines is
 
01:45:08.149 --> 01:45:08.159 align:start position:0%
broken and it's banging off the dock and
 
01:45:11.189 --> 01:45:11.199 align:start position:0%
and they weren't weight surfing so I
 
01:45:12.750 --> 01:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
think it's really challenging to point
 
01:45:15.310 --> 01:45:15.320 align:start position:0%
your finger at one specific activity or
 
01:45:17.709 --> 01:45:17.719 align:start position:0%
one Reckless person
 
01:45:21.350 --> 01:45:21.360 align:start position:0%
um we all know that you know this one
 
01:45:22.830 --> 01:45:22.840 align:start position:0%
bad egg got there that's going to ruin
 
01:45:24.350 --> 01:45:24.360 align:start position:0%
for everybody and that's not that's not
 
01:45:26.790 --> 01:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
fair to the general public okay one one
 
01:45:28.589 --> 01:45:28.599 align:start position:0%
more question Mr one more all right
 
01:45:32.189 --> 01:45:32.199 align:start position:0%
thank you um so you're aware I mean
 
01:45:34.750 --> 01:45:34.760 align:start position:0%
we've had a petition process in statute
 
01:45:37.629 --> 01:45:37.639 align:start position:0%
for years in fact uh former US
 
01:45:39.629 --> 01:45:39.639 align:start position:0%
Congressman Charlie bass was the one
 
01:45:43.470 --> 01:45:43.480 align:start position:0%
that introduced it U many many years ago
 
01:45:45.750 --> 01:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
um when he was a state representative or
 
01:45:49.550 --> 01:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
maybe a state senator but um so this
 
01:45:51.470 --> 01:45:51.480 align:start position:0%
petition process
 
01:45:54.629 --> 01:45:54.639 align:start position:0%
is it's not the people on the lake that
 
01:45:57.189 --> 01:45:57.199 align:start position:0%
are making the determination they're
 
01:45:59.830 --> 01:45:59.840 align:start position:0%
just making a request that that be
 
01:46:01.950 --> 01:46:01.960 align:start position:0%
examined by the department of safety
 
01:46:03.270 --> 01:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
through a hearing
 
01:46:08.030 --> 01:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
process um so do you do you trust the
 
01:46:12.109 --> 01:46:12.119 align:start position:0%
department of safety to make a um a
 
01:46:14.589 --> 01:46:14.599 align:start position:0%
reasonable uh resolution to that
 
01:46:16.870 --> 01:46:16.880 align:start position:0%
petition whether it be dismissing it or
 
01:46:19.790 --> 01:46:19.800 align:start position:0%
agreeing to it I mean do you think they
 
01:46:22.430 --> 01:46:22.440 align:start position:0%
would be able ble to make a a fair
 
01:46:24.709 --> 01:46:24.719 align:start position:0%
judgment if a petition were to come to
 
01:46:26.990 --> 01:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
them restricting weight surfing on a
 
01:46:30.310 --> 01:46:30.320 align:start position:0%
lake I do yes I mean I think they're
 
01:46:31.390 --> 01:46:31.400 align:start position:0%
they're the ones that are probably the
 
01:46:34.149 --> 01:46:34.159 align:start position:0%
most knowledgeable of on waterer
 
01:46:38.430 --> 01:46:38.440 align:start position:0%
activities over anybody um I just going
 
01:46:40.830 --> 01:46:40.840 align:start position:0%
back to your prior statement I think you
 
01:46:44.149 --> 01:46:44.159 align:start position:0%
said know it's not just people on water
 
01:46:46.109 --> 01:46:46.119 align:start position:0%
bodies that would petition did you just
 
01:46:48.189 --> 01:46:48.199 align:start position:0%
say that I'm not trying to I don't want
 
01:46:50.870 --> 01:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
to get confused uh no I'm just saying
 
01:46:53.750 --> 01:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
that there would be a petition coming to
 
01:46:56.350 --> 01:46:56.360 align:start position:0%
the to the Department of Safety but they
 
01:46:59.430 --> 01:46:59.440 align:start position:0%
would make the judgment and I mean I've
 
01:47:02.510 --> 01:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
hear your opposition to the bill but at
 
01:47:04.990 --> 01:47:05.000 align:start position:0%
the end it's the department of safety
 
01:47:07.189 --> 01:47:07.199 align:start position:0%
decision and is that a decision that you
 
01:47:09.629 --> 01:47:09.639 align:start position:0%
would consider reasonable and valid
 
01:47:12.669 --> 01:47:12.679 align:start position:0%
depending on their expertise I would yes
 
01:47:16.229 --> 01:47:16.239 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you Mr
 
01:47:19.950 --> 01:47:19.960 align:start position:0%
chair thank you representative McHugh
 
01:47:21.790 --> 01:47:21.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Mr chairman thank you Mr
 
01:47:23.149 --> 01:47:23.159 align:start position:0%
wle for coming to share with us your
 
01:47:26.709 --> 01:47:26.719 align:start position:0%
expertise we appreciate it um in regards
 
01:47:29.470 --> 01:47:29.480 align:start position:0%
to those petitions and the petitions
 
01:47:30.990 --> 01:47:31.000 align:start position:0%
that have been sent to the Department of
 
01:47:34.950 --> 01:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
Safety before is it is it possible to
 
01:47:37.310 --> 01:47:37.320 align:start position:0%
generalize and say that they're all the
 
01:47:40.470 --> 01:47:40.480 align:start position:0%
same and they would you know make the
 
01:47:42.790 --> 01:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
right decision every time or there might
 
01:47:44.470 --> 01:47:44.480 align:start position:0%
be political pressures or divided
 
01:47:46.350 --> 01:47:46.360 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods or divided Lake
 
01:47:48.550 --> 01:47:48.560 align:start position:0%
Associations so my I guess my question
 
01:47:51.589 --> 01:47:51.599 align:start position:0%
is um is it really possible to address
 
01:47:54.990 --> 01:47:55.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:56.950 --> 01:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
question personally I would say it'd be
 
01:47:59.510 --> 01:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
very challenging I think when you look
 
01:48:01.270 --> 01:48:01.280 align:start position:0%
at the scope of different sizes of legs
 
01:48:03.790 --> 01:48:03.800 align:start position:0%
too you know you take a lake
 
01:48:05.990 --> 01:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
on I can't think off top of my head a
 
01:48:10.030 --> 01:48:10.040 align:start position:0%
very small Lake but I I'll use merry
 
01:48:12.950 --> 01:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
meeting Lake in Alton it's relatively
 
01:48:15.070 --> 01:48:15.080 align:start position:0%
small I don't I don't know the number of
 
01:48:19.430 --> 01:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
homes on it but 25 people on that L may
 
01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:20.950 align:start position:0%
homes on it but 25 people on that L may
be

01:48:20.950 --> 01:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:48:26.229 --> 01:48:26.239 align:start position:0%
10% 25 people on Lake lisaki maybe 0.1%
 
01:48:29.229 --> 01:48:29.239 align:start position:0%
you know the lakes are so unique they're
 
01:48:32.510 --> 01:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
so vast it's challenging that you know
 
01:48:35.830 --> 01:48:35.840 align:start position:0%
you could get 25 people on Lake Baki by
 
01:48:37.470 --> 01:48:37.480 align:start position:0%
going to the marath town docks and bump
 
01:48:41.149 --> 01:48:41.159 align:start position:0%
it into them on a Saturday afternoon um
 
01:48:43.709 --> 01:48:43.719 align:start position:0%
I think we have to believe that at the
 
01:48:44.750 --> 01:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
end of the
 
01:48:50.229 --> 01:48:50.239 align:start position:0%
day our public waterways are a gift to
 
01:48:51.950 --> 01:48:51.960 align:start position:0%
all the people that don't have the
 
01:48:55.550 --> 01:48:55.560 align:start position:0%
luxury to own resident land or homes or
 
01:48:57.830 --> 01:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
property on those waterways and to
 
01:49:00.229 --> 01:49:00.239 align:start position:0%
restrict them from doing
 
01:49:02.589 --> 01:49:02.599 align:start position:0%
anything this just can I feel like this
 
01:49:04.189 --> 01:49:04.199 align:start position:0%
just creates a challenge down the road
 
01:49:07.070 --> 01:49:07.080 align:start position:0%
for someone doesn't like tubing someone
 
01:49:09.470 --> 01:49:09.480 align:start position:0%
that doesn't like water skiing someone
 
01:49:11.189 --> 01:49:11.199 align:start position:0%
that doesn't like loud music on a Ponto
 
01:49:12.910 --> 01:49:12.920 align:start position:0%
B I mean not the I don't waste him when
 
01:49:16.229 --> 01:49:16.239 align:start position:0%
time it just it poses future challenges
 
01:49:16.239 --> 01:49:17.310 align:start position:0%
time it just it poses future challenges
follow

01:49:17.310 --> 01:49:17.320 align:start position:0%
follow
 
01:49:20.910 --> 01:49:20.920 align:start position:0%
up thanks uh just one followup or kite
 
01:49:23.310 --> 01:49:23.320 align:start position:0%
surfing ice surfing or whatever would
 
01:49:25.109 --> 01:49:25.119 align:start position:0%
you believe that my one of my very best
 
01:49:26.589 --> 01:49:26.599 align:start position:0%
friends a full-time resident and
 
01:49:29.950 --> 01:49:29.960 align:start position:0%
property owner on Silver Lake in Madison
 
01:49:32.589 --> 01:49:32.599 align:start position:0%
uh emailed me on this and he's a guy I I
 
01:49:35.310 --> 01:49:35.320 align:start position:0%
trust quite a bit and he said uh a wake
 
01:49:37.990 --> 01:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
boat came by and P I think he said
 
01:49:41.790 --> 01:49:41.800 align:start position:0%
punctured my standup paddle board and I
 
01:49:43.310 --> 01:49:43.320 align:start position:0%
haven't gotten into it the details not
 
01:49:46.589 --> 01:49:46.599 align:start position:0%
sure how that could have happened um but
 
01:49:49.550 --> 01:49:49.560 align:start position:0%
even he is reluctant to pit neighbor
 
01:49:49.560 --> 01:49:50.790 align:start position:0%
even he is reluctant to pit neighbor
versus

01:49:50.790 --> 01:49:50.800 align:start position:0%
versus
 
01:49:53.910 --> 01:49:53.920 align:start position:0%
neighbor on on this would you and and
 
01:49:55.870 --> 01:49:55.880 align:start position:0%
actually the solution was as you
 
01:49:58.669 --> 01:49:58.679 align:start position:0%
mentioned would you believe uh that he
 
01:50:01.790 --> 01:50:01.800 align:start position:0%
asked the person would you mind just not
 
01:50:04.229 --> 01:50:04.239 align:start position:0%
circling between the small island right
 
01:50:07.109 --> 01:50:07.119 align:start position:0%
off my property and the shoreline just
 
01:50:09.310 --> 01:50:09.320 align:start position:0%
keep it outside the Cove basically and
 
01:50:10.990 --> 01:50:11.000 align:start position:0%
that was a pleasant I think that's the
 
01:50:12.629 --> 01:50:12.639 align:start position:0%
way to go I'll I'll leave you with this
 
01:50:15.470 --> 01:50:15.480 align:start position:0%
one story my parents have a a small swim
 
01:50:17.910 --> 01:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
raft my dad built back when I was a
 
01:50:20.910 --> 01:50:20.920 align:start position:0%
little kid and probably 10 years into
 
01:50:22.550 --> 01:50:22.560 align:start position:0%
being in the water the Alton Bay
 
01:50:26.390 --> 01:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
fireworks my mother has a home at 10:00
 
01:50:27.830 --> 01:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
at night when it ends everyone leaves
 
01:50:29.950 --> 01:50:29.960 align:start position:0%
Alton Bay it's a basically like going
 
01:50:31.910 --> 01:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
down the highway in a heavy traffic load
 
01:50:33.790 --> 01:50:33.800 align:start position:0%
everyone's going basically what I would
 
01:50:35.910 --> 01:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
call wake surfing speed or 10 miles hour
 
01:50:38.709 --> 01:50:38.719 align:start position:0%
or less well one night a chain
 
01:50:41.390 --> 01:50:41.400 align:start position:0%
broke because of that there was nobody
 
01:50:43.229 --> 01:50:43.239 align:start position:0%
WG surfing at night on the July 3rd I
 
01:50:46.189 --> 01:50:46.199 align:start position:0%
can promise you this was 25 years ago so
 
01:50:49.270 --> 01:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
things happen wave activities happen
 
01:50:51.430 --> 01:50:51.440 align:start position:0%
wind waves happen happen boat waves
 
01:50:54.870 --> 01:50:54.880 align:start position:0%
happen it's if you look around on most
 
01:50:56.750 --> 01:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
of our Shor lines they're Rocky from
 
01:50:59.030 --> 01:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
thousands of years of wind in water
 
01:51:00.990 --> 01:51:01.000 align:start position:0%
crashing against these long before any
 
01:51:04.470 --> 01:51:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:06.550 --> 01:51:06.560 align:start position:0%
introduced thank you re I just want to
 
01:51:09.069 --> 01:51:09.079 align:start position:0%

01:51:18.149 --> 01:51:18.159 align:start position:0%
1401 about the transfer of Silver Lake
 
01:51:20.030 --> 01:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
Park we've been advised that the SP
 
01:51:22.550 --> 01:51:22.560 align:start position:0%
sponsor is going to ask to withdraw that
 
01:51:25.790 --> 01:51:25.800 align:start position:0%
bill so you're welcome to hang around

what I'm passing around is a map of the
 
01:52:26.229 --> 01:52:26.239 align:start position:0%
lake that I am going to
 
01:52:30.149 --> 01:52:30.159 align:start position:0%
address my name is Warren Emily and I
 
01:52:34.270 --> 01:52:34.280 align:start position:0%
own a lakefront property on Lake wiip
 
01:52:35.350 --> 01:52:35.360 align:start position:0%
pocket in
 
01:52:38.109 --> 01:52:38.119 align:start position:0%
Webster I've had that property for 28
 
01:52:40.270 --> 01:52:40.280 align:start position:0%
years and so I kind of know the ins and
 
01:52:41.589 --> 01:52:41.599 align:start position:0%
outs of the
 
01:52:44.910 --> 01:52:44.920 align:start position:0%
lake I'm here to speak in favor of this
 
01:52:44.920 --> 01:52:46.709 align:start position:0%
lake I'm here to speak in favor of this
bill

01:52:46.709 --> 01:52:46.719 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:52:49.830 --> 01:52:49.840 align:start position:0%
1301 and i' like to do this by sharing
 
01:52:51.669 --> 01:52:51.679 align:start position:0%
our experience on Lake wiip pocket
 
01:52:53.350 --> 01:52:53.360 align:start position:0%
because we can talk about things in
 
01:52:56.550 --> 01:52:56.560 align:start position:0%
general terms but isn't it equally
 
01:52:58.950 --> 01:52:58.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate to hear of somebody's
 
01:53:03.270 --> 01:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
experience about a wake booat on a lake
 
01:53:07.149 --> 01:53:07.159 align:start position:0%
lake wiip pocket in Webster is a glacial
 
01:53:10.189 --> 01:53:10.199 align:start position:0%
Springfed Lake an oligotrophic
 
01:53:12.629 --> 01:53:12.639 align:start position:0%
Lake uh we know it's oligotrophic
 
01:53:15.069 --> 01:53:15.079 align:start position:0%
because we've been VAP participants for
 
01:53:17.470 --> 01:53:17.480 align:start position:0%
the past 28 years and we test the water
 
01:53:20.390 --> 01:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis and we have not had
 
01:53:22.510 --> 01:53:22.520 align:start position:0%
any excess bacteria we've not had any
 
01:53:25.870 --> 01:53:25.880 align:start position:0%
mil foil our mineral contents are steady
 
01:53:28.669 --> 01:53:28.679 align:start position:0%
it's a lake you could almost drink the
 
01:53:32.830 --> 01:53:32.840 align:start position:0%
water from it's a 230 acre lake so it's
 
01:53:35.550 --> 01:53:35.560 align:start position:0%
a moderate size and there are of course
 
01:53:37.629 --> 01:53:37.639 align:start position:0%
hundreds of lakes that qualify in the
 
01:53:39.229 --> 01:53:39.239 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire like
 
01:53:43.229 --> 01:53:43.239 align:start position:0%
that its maximum depth is 67
 
01:53:46.910 --> 01:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
feet its average depth is 19
 
01:53:50.270 --> 01:53:50.280 align:start position:0%
ft and I show the map around because I
 
01:53:53.430 --> 01:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
want to say that the lake can be divided
 
01:53:56.109 --> 01:53:56.119 align:start position:0%
depthwise into two
 
01:53:59.189 --> 01:53:59.199 align:start position:0%
parts the third of this of this more
 
01:54:02.069 --> 01:54:02.079 align:start position:0%
shallow end has a maximum depth of
 
01:54:04.430 --> 01:54:04.440 align:start position:0%
usually 16 or so feet of course that
 
01:54:07.149 --> 01:54:07.159 align:start position:0%
varies with rain and so on so forth but
 
01:54:09.149 --> 01:54:09.159 align:start position:0%
it's around that onethird of the Shallow
 
01:54:11.270 --> 01:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
Lake where virtually all of the
 
01:54:16.870 --> 01:54:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:20.189 --> 01:54:20.199 align:start position:0%
exist The Watershed is very clean we
 
01:54:22.350 --> 01:54:22.360 align:start position:0%
have no agriculture in the area we have
 
01:54:24.470 --> 01:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
no businesses we have no
 
01:54:27.229 --> 01:54:27.239 align:start position:0%
industry and so over the years the
 
01:54:29.950 --> 01:54:29.960 align:start position:0%
quality of water has depended upon the
 
01:54:31.790 --> 01:54:31.800 align:start position:0%
residents around the lake to make sure
 
01:54:33.790 --> 01:54:33.800 align:start position:0%
their septic systems are clean and we
 
01:54:37.149 --> 01:54:37.159 align:start position:0%
check on this on a regular basis um that
 
01:54:38.790 --> 01:54:38.800 align:start position:0%
the vegetation around the lake is
 
01:54:41.310 --> 01:54:41.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate the runoff is not excessive
 
01:54:44.069 --> 01:54:44.079 align:start position:0%
from roads and so on and we've been
 
01:54:48.669 --> 01:54:48.679 align:start position:0%
knock on wood remarkably successful in
 
01:54:48.679 --> 01:54:50.629 align:start position:0%
knock on wood remarkably successful in
this

01:54:50.629 --> 01:54:50.639 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:54:52.790 --> 01:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
so what's going on what's my point here
 
01:54:54.189 --> 01:54:54.199 align:start position:0%
I want to bring you back a couple of
 
01:54:56.149 --> 01:54:56.159 align:start position:0%
years ago actually it was the summer of
 
01:54:59.030 --> 01:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
2020 we were enjoying our Lake one of
 
01:55:02.709 --> 01:55:02.719 align:start position:0%
our long-term Lake owners purchased a
 
01:55:02.719 --> 01:55:03.550 align:start position:0%
our long-term Lake owners purchased a
wake

01:55:03.550 --> 01:55:03.560 align:start position:0%
wake
 
01:55:06.069 --> 01:55:06.079 align:start position:0%
booat a well-respected member of our
 
01:55:08.910 --> 01:55:08.920 align:start position:0%
Lake Community 2020 you'll recall was
 
01:55:11.950 --> 01:55:11.960 align:start position:0%
the beginning of the co we got to stay
 
01:55:14.030 --> 01:55:14.040 align:start position:0%
inside we can't go anywhere we can't do
 
01:55:16.669 --> 01:55:16.679 align:start position:0%
anything so I understand the reason for
 
01:55:19.390 --> 01:55:19.400 align:start position:0%
maybe purchasing uh a structure like
 
01:55:22.430 --> 01:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
this or um a boat like this because what
 
01:55:23.470 --> 01:55:23.480 align:start position:0%
else are you going to do you're not
 
01:55:24.950 --> 01:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
going to go anywhere everything's closed
 
01:55:27.310 --> 01:55:27.320 align:start position:0%
the movie theaters are closed so I think
 
01:55:28.950 --> 01:55:28.960 align:start position:0%
in good conscious he bought this Lake
 
01:55:30.669 --> 01:55:30.679 align:start position:0%
boat because he had some teenagers and
 
01:55:32.470 --> 01:55:32.480 align:start position:0%
he said you know what are they going to
 
01:55:33.950 --> 01:55:33.960 align:start position:0%
do at least they're going to be around
 
01:55:35.270 --> 01:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
and we can watch them and it's a nice
 
01:55:35.280 --> 01:55:36.229 align:start position:0%
and we can watch them and it's a nice
clean

01:55:36.229 --> 01:55:36.239 align:start position:0%
clean
 
01:55:39.270 --> 01:55:39.280 align:start position:0%
activity so he began to run his wake
 
01:55:41.229 --> 01:55:41.239 align:start position:0%
booat up and down the shallow portion of
 
01:55:41.239 --> 01:55:42.470 align:start position:0%
booat up and down the shallow portion of
our

01:55:42.470 --> 01:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:55:45.430 --> 01:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
Lake every time that happened uh we
 
01:55:47.350 --> 01:55:47.360 align:start position:0%
around the lake experience at least one
 
01:55:50.030 --> 01:55:50.040 align:start position:0%
to two foot waves crashing ing on the
 
01:55:51.870 --> 01:55:51.880 align:start position:0%
shore causing the erosion all the things
 
01:55:54.189 --> 01:55:54.199 align:start position:0%
that you've heard about impossible to
 
01:55:58.390 --> 01:55:58.400 align:start position:0%
swim small craft was jostled or turned
 
01:56:01.950 --> 01:56:01.960 align:start position:0%
over and of all things we had our one
 
01:56:04.830 --> 01:56:04.840 align:start position:0%
and only cyano bacteria infective
 
01:56:06.550 --> 01:56:06.560 align:start position:0%
infection in the lake that
 
01:56:09.270 --> 01:56:09.280 align:start position:0%
summer uh we could argue whether or not
 
01:56:10.910 --> 01:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
the Wake booat had anything to do but I
 
01:56:13.790 --> 01:56:13.800 align:start position:0%
will tell you this when that wake booat
 
01:56:16.870 --> 01:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
went by within minutes the wave hit the
 
01:56:20.229 --> 01:56:20.239 align:start position:0%
shore and the water turned totally murky
 
01:56:23.189 --> 01:56:23.199 align:start position:0%
you could not see the bottom and that
 
01:56:28.270 --> 01:56:28.280 align:start position:0%
murkiness lasted for 24 36 hours no one
 
01:56:30.229 --> 01:56:30.239 align:start position:0%
would go in the water to swim the
 
01:56:32.990 --> 01:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
fishermen said we can't fish here and
 
01:56:35.350 --> 01:56:35.360 align:start position:0%
that really was a direct result of the
 
01:56:37.830 --> 01:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
scum which is carved Up From the Bottom
 
01:56:40.550 --> 01:56:40.560 align:start position:0%
by the activity of the Wake
 
01:56:43.270 --> 01:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
boat so I'm really making a plea here
 
01:56:45.990 --> 01:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
for the size and the depth of the lake
 
01:56:47.870 --> 01:56:47.880 align:start position:0%
we're talking about makes a huge
 
01:56:49.669 --> 01:56:49.679 align:start position:0%
difference in terms of what these w wake
 
01:56:52.790 --> 01:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
boats can inadvertently
 
01:56:56.229 --> 01:56:56.239 align:start position:0%
do well that created a huge conation
 
01:56:59.189 --> 01:56:59.199 align:start position:0%
among Lake owners virtually all said we
 
01:57:00.790 --> 01:57:00.800 align:start position:0%
don't want these wake boats because look
 
01:57:01.750 --> 01:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
what they're
 
01:57:04.189 --> 01:57:04.199 align:start position:0%
doing damaging our property and
 
01:57:06.669 --> 01:57:06.679 align:start position:0%
preventing us from enjoying the water
 
01:57:08.350 --> 01:57:08.360 align:start position:0%
but of course the lake owner said look
 
01:57:09.990 --> 01:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
you know I made all this money
 
01:57:12.669 --> 01:57:12.679 align:start position:0%
investment in this boat it's great it's
 
01:57:15.030 --> 01:57:15.040 align:start position:0%
safe it's out there where you can see it
 
01:57:16.830 --> 01:57:16.840 align:start position:0%
it's good activity for our families and
 
01:57:18.149 --> 01:57:18.159 align:start position:0%
so on and so
 
01:57:22.229 --> 01:57:22.239 align:start position:0%
forth no no one could resolve the issue
 
01:57:26.390 --> 01:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
it was rancorous it was tight it was
 
01:57:29.470 --> 01:57:29.480 align:start position:0%
very very sad friends not talking to
 
01:57:32.830 --> 01:57:32.840 align:start position:0%
friends my point is to try to resolve
 
01:57:36.189 --> 01:57:36.199 align:start position:0%
something like this on a personal basis
 
01:57:39.109 --> 01:57:39.119 align:start position:0%
is fraught with failure so what happened
 
01:57:42.870 --> 01:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
to Lake wiip pocket the lake owner sold
 
01:57:45.790 --> 01:57:45.800 align:start position:0%
his property and took his wake booat
 
01:57:48.109 --> 01:57:48.119 align:start position:0%
with him and so we didn't have him on
 
01:57:50.229 --> 01:57:50.239 align:start position:0%
the lake we've had an occasional visitor
 
01:57:52.229 --> 01:57:52.239 align:start position:0%
wake booat in the meantime but it hasn't
 
01:57:55.350 --> 01:57:55.360 align:start position:0%
really created the same upset of the
 
01:57:59.750 --> 01:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:04.790 --> 01:58:04.800 align:start position:0%
summer so my conclusions are these I
 
01:58:06.790 --> 01:58:06.800 align:start position:0%
think small lakes or moderate sized
 
01:58:09.950 --> 01:58:09.960 align:start position:0%
Lakes are the most vulnerable to wake
 
01:58:12.990 --> 01:58:13.000 align:start position:0%
surfing activity just because of the
 
01:58:15.310 --> 01:58:15.320 align:start position:0%
nature and the physics and the energy
 
01:58:17.950 --> 01:58:17.960 align:start position:0%
that these boats can create and disrupt
 
01:58:20.990 --> 01:58:21.000 align:start position:0%
the water and disrupt uh the surrounding
 
01:58:23.550 --> 01:58:23.560 align:start position:0%
surroundings so if our experience is any
 
01:58:26.069 --> 01:58:26.079 align:start position:0%
indication I want to say again leaving
 
01:58:29.069 --> 01:58:29.079 align:start position:0%
the decision for should we allow should
 
01:58:31.990 --> 01:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
we have a wake booat on this lake or not
 
01:58:34.149 --> 01:58:34.159 align:start position:0%
is a powerless decision because it can't
 
01:58:34.159 --> 01:58:35.069 align:start position:0%
is a powerless decision because it can't
be

01:58:35.069 --> 01:58:35.079 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:58:37.589 --> 01:58:37.599 align:start position:0%
enforced uh maybe the lake owners around
 
01:58:39.310 --> 01:58:39.320 align:start position:0%
will say yeah we probably shouldn't do
 
01:58:40.790 --> 01:58:40.800 align:start position:0%
this but it doesn't prevent somebody
 
01:58:43.030 --> 01:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
from Massachusetts or some other City
 
01:58:45.229 --> 01:58:45.239 align:start position:0%
saying hey this is a cute little Lake
 
01:58:48.069 --> 01:58:48.079 align:start position:0%
let's just put our boats in and go and
 
01:58:50.270 --> 01:58:50.280 align:start position:0%
we would have um the residents would
 
01:58:53.149 --> 01:58:53.159 align:start position:0%
have absolutely no say in whether or not
 
01:58:55.229 --> 01:58:55.239 align:start position:0%
that would happen the way things are now
 
01:58:56.950 --> 01:58:56.960 align:start position:0%
like when a pocket locked out because
 
01:58:59.550 --> 01:58:59.560 align:start position:0%
the owner whether he just said I can't
 
01:59:01.470 --> 01:59:01.480 align:start position:0%
stand to hear my neighbors talk like
 
01:59:04.109 --> 01:59:04.119 align:start position:0%
this went somewhere else whatever his
 
01:59:06.390 --> 01:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
motive was bless his heart he's probably
 
01:59:08.629 --> 01:59:08.639 align:start position:0%
doing the boat somewhere else but to the
 
01:59:11.109 --> 01:59:11.119 align:start position:0%
benefit of the lake itself it was to our
 
01:59:12.950 --> 01:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
advantage that he decided to take his
 
01:59:12.960 --> 01:59:15.669 align:start position:0%
advantage that he decided to take his
craft

01:59:15.669 --> 01:59:15.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:18.350 --> 01:59:18.360 align:start position:0%
elsewhere so the last thing I want to
 
01:59:20.589 --> 01:59:20.599 align:start position:0%
say I believe and now it could use some
 
01:59:23.310 --> 01:59:23.320 align:start position:0%
tweaking perhaps but House Bill
 
01:59:26.950 --> 01:59:26.960 align:start position:0%
1301 uh I think has a potential for
 
01:59:29.990 --> 01:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
solving the partisanship issue by
 
01:59:32.830 --> 01:59:32.840 align:start position:0%
creating a nonbiased
 
01:59:35.589 --> 01:59:35.599 align:start position:0%
commission to make a rational and
 
01:59:35.599 --> 01:59:36.709 align:start position:0%
commission to make a rational and
fact-based

01:59:36.709 --> 01:59:36.719 align:start position:0%
fact-based
 
01:59:39.149 --> 01:59:39.159 align:start position:0%
decision about the use of wake boats on
 
01:59:41.030 --> 01:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
any given water
 
01:59:44.550 --> 01:59:44.560 align:start position:0%
body based on the critical factors that
 
01:59:48.229 --> 01:59:48.239 align:start position:0%
are enumerated in item four in the
 
01:59:50.950 --> 01:59:50.960 align:start position:0%
bill thank you very much Mr chairman I
 
01:59:52.750 --> 01:59:52.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to give my
 
01:59:54.790 --> 01:59:54.800 align:start position:0%
story and I hope that puts a real life
 
01:59:57.550 --> 01:59:57.560 align:start position:0%
perspective on what lots of lakes around
 
02:00:00.510 --> 02:00:00.520 align:start position:0%
the state are faced with I'm happy to
 
02:00:02.790 --> 02:00:02.800 align:start position:0%
answer any questions do you have any
 
02:00:05.629 --> 02:00:05.639 align:start position:0%
questions representative mchu thank you
 
02:00:06.870 --> 02:00:06.880 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for coming to
 
02:00:08.470 --> 02:00:08.480 align:start position:0%
share your story with us it's really
 
02:00:11.709 --> 02:00:11.719 align:start position:0%
tough when the nice welcoming culture of
 
02:00:13.830 --> 02:00:13.840 align:start position:0%
our Lakes region is divided with friends
 
02:00:15.470 --> 02:00:15.480 align:start position:0%
not talking to
 
02:00:19.189 --> 02:00:19.199 align:start position:0%
friends and essentially it sounds like
 
02:00:22.430 --> 02:00:22.440 align:start position:0%
forcing this property owner to take his
 
02:00:24.430 --> 02:00:24.440 align:start position:0%
leisure life elsewhere that's a shame
 
02:00:25.830 --> 02:00:25.840 align:start position:0%
and I'm very sorry that happened and I
 
02:00:27.069 --> 02:00:27.079 align:start position:0%
hope that those friends are friends
 
02:00:29.310 --> 02:00:29.320 align:start position:0%
again and talking again and I wish on
 
02:00:30.950 --> 02:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
you that that will never happen again my
 
02:00:34.350 --> 02:00:34.360 align:start position:0%
question is do you think that a a a
 
02:00:36.629 --> 02:00:36.639 align:start position:0%
government or or or a petition process
 
02:00:37.709 --> 02:00:37.719 align:start position:0%
by the
 
02:00:39.990 --> 02:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
minority of the property owners a
 
02:00:42.350 --> 02:00:42.360 align:start position:0%
relatively small minority is going to
 
02:00:46.430 --> 02:00:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:50.270 --> 02:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
again I think it potentially could yes
 
02:00:53.510 --> 02:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
but creating a petition simply expresses
 
02:00:56.270 --> 02:00:56.280 align:start position:0%
the thoughts of some very concerned
 
02:00:58.669 --> 02:00:58.679 align:start position:0%
people it's not those people that are
 
02:01:00.910 --> 02:01:00.920 align:start position:0%
going to make the decision but will able
 
02:01:03.669 --> 02:01:03.679 align:start position:0%
be able to submit the issue to what I
 
02:01:06.149 --> 02:01:06.159 align:start position:0%
again I said would be a dispassionate
 
02:01:10.069 --> 02:01:10.079 align:start position:0%
group who can objectively look and from
 
02:01:12.669 --> 02:01:12.679 align:start position:0%
the perspective both from The Boat
 
02:01:14.390 --> 02:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
Owners we got to provide a place for
 
02:01:16.149 --> 02:01:16.159 align:start position:0%
these Boat Owners to run their boats
 
02:01:18.310 --> 02:01:18.320 align:start position:0%
because they're great fun and good
 
02:01:21.589 --> 02:01:21.599 align:start position:0%
vehicles and uh entertaining at the same
 
02:01:23.589 --> 02:01:23.599 align:start position:0%
time to preserve the quality of the
 
02:01:26.629 --> 02:01:26.639 align:start position:0%
lakes that are most vulnerable obviously
 
02:01:28.750 --> 02:01:28.760 align:start position:0%
people living around the lake and say we
 
02:01:30.390 --> 02:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
don't want them on our Lake because it's
 
02:01:32.870 --> 02:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
our property but we're talking about
 
02:01:34.830 --> 02:01:34.840 align:start position:0%
really the future health of the lake not
 
02:01:38.270 --> 02:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
just for our generation but if the uh
 
02:01:41.390 --> 02:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
Lakes are really ruined ecologically
 
02:01:43.069 --> 02:01:43.079 align:start position:0%
what's the future of tourism in New
 
02:01:44.510 --> 02:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if we don't really kind of put
 
02:01:46.830 --> 02:01:46.840 align:start position:0%
a framework around where these boats can
 
02:01:49.550 --> 02:01:49.560 align:start position:0%
really function and not
 
02:01:51.390 --> 02:01:51.400 align:start position:0%
jeopardize I think the health of the
 
02:01:55.990 --> 02:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
Lakes so my point is that the um the
 
02:01:58.270 --> 02:01:58.280 align:start position:0%
non-biased hopefully commission would be
 
02:02:00.950 --> 02:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
able to take the numbers and decide yes
 
02:02:02.910 --> 02:02:02.920 align:start position:0%
wake boats are okay here but they're not
 
02:02:02.920 --> 02:02:04.109 align:start position:0%
wake boats are okay here but they're not
okay

02:02:04.109 --> 02:02:04.119 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:02:06.790 --> 02:02:06.800 align:start position:0%
here one followup thanks for the
 
02:02:08.669 --> 02:02:08.679 align:start position:0%
followup um thanks for taking the
 
02:02:09.870 --> 02:02:09.880 align:start position:0%
question then it's a great point you
 
02:02:11.629 --> 02:02:11.639 align:start position:0%
brought up about the Ecology of the lake
 
02:02:13.229 --> 02:02:13.239 align:start position:0%
because we I think we're all generally
 
02:02:16.030 --> 02:02:16.040 align:start position:0%
concerned about that um let's look at
 
02:02:18.390 --> 02:02:18.400 align:start position:0%
one of those ecological issues and think
 
02:02:20.189 --> 02:02:20.199 align:start position:0%
about what could banned next what about
 
02:02:22.589 --> 02:02:22.599 align:start position:0%
fishing from your dock or over fishing
 
02:02:24.189 --> 02:02:24.199 align:start position:0%
from your dock I mean there are per you
 
02:02:25.910 --> 02:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
know limits and permits and things like
 
02:02:27.750 --> 02:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
that but what if the boers don't want to
 
02:02:30.310 --> 02:02:30.320 align:start position:0%
be in front of the you know caught up in
 
02:02:32.510 --> 02:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
the in the fish lines or just don't want
 
02:02:34.589 --> 02:02:34.599 align:start position:0%
to have to avoid them and they petition
 
02:02:37.870 --> 02:02:37.880 align:start position:0%
to Outlaw fishing is that is would that
 
02:02:39.350 --> 02:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
be a problem and would you how would you
 
02:02:41.390 --> 02:02:41.400 align:start position:0%
feel if you had to hire a lawyer to
 
02:02:43.430 --> 02:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
defend your right to fish off your dock
 
02:02:45.109 --> 02:02:45.119 align:start position:0%
in front of I think I would be very
 
02:02:46.950 --> 02:02:46.960 align:start position:0%
upset about that because fishing off the
 
02:02:49.189 --> 02:02:49.199 align:start position:0%
dock is as old as the hills and honestly
 
02:02:51.669 --> 02:02:51.679 align:start position:0%
what adverse effect does that have on
 
02:02:53.550 --> 02:02:53.560 align:start position:0%
the Ecology of the
 
02:02:56.390 --> 02:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
lake you know I mean we talk about lead
 
02:02:57.790 --> 02:02:57.800 align:start position:0%
sinkers and all that and we've all
 
02:02:59.870 --> 02:02:59.880 align:start position:0%
abided by that pretty much that's just
 
02:03:02.910 --> 02:03:02.920 align:start position:0%
common sense but when an activity really
 
02:03:05.229 --> 02:03:05.239 align:start position:0%
jeopardizes the health of the lake in a
 
02:03:07.950 --> 02:03:07.960 align:start position:0%
long-term way I think that's a different
 
02:03:10.470 --> 02:03:10.480 align:start position:0%
issue especially when there are places
 
02:03:13.350 --> 02:03:13.360 align:start position:0%
where these amazing Vehicles could be
 
02:03:16.870 --> 02:03:16.880 align:start position:0%
used in a more ecologically friendly
 
02:03:20.870 --> 02:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
way representative of a
 
02:03:22.830 --> 02:03:22.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um I just have a
 
02:03:26.030 --> 02:03:26.040 align:start position:0%
quick question and that's of do you know
 
02:03:29.709 --> 02:03:29.719 align:start position:0%
of lakes or ponds where wake surfing or
 
02:03:31.350 --> 02:03:31.360 align:start position:0%
wake boats are already
 
02:03:33.470 --> 02:03:33.480 align:start position:0%
banned I do
 
02:03:36.390 --> 02:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
not I think the uh gentleman speaking
 
02:03:38.109 --> 02:03:38.119 align:start position:0%
before me said that there are no
 
02:03:40.510 --> 02:03:40.520 align:start position:0%
restrictions at the present time in any
 
02:03:41.950 --> 02:03:41.960 align:start position:0%
body of water in the state of New
 
02:03:44.350 --> 02:03:44.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for the use of Lake boats
 
02:03:47.030 --> 02:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
that's that's what I heard the answer to
 
02:03:49.709 --> 02:03:49.719 align:start position:0%
your question is no I don't know of any
 
02:03:51.870 --> 02:03:51.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
02:03:54.589 --> 02:03:54.599 align:start position:0%
representative run thank you Mr chair
 
02:03:57.310 --> 02:03:57.320 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question um
 
02:03:59.549 --> 02:03:59.559 align:start position:0%
you described a it seemed like a
 
02:04:02.350 --> 02:04:02.360 align:start position:0%
prolonged period of time on lake wiip
 
02:04:05.549 --> 02:04:05.559 align:start position:0%
lake wiip pocket where residents were
 
02:04:08.709 --> 02:04:08.719 align:start position:0%
having some serious conflicts um do you
 
02:04:10.950 --> 02:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
think that if this bill were to pass and
 
02:04:13.189 --> 02:04:13.199 align:start position:0%
residents were able to P petition the
 
02:04:15.549 --> 02:04:15.559 align:start position:0%
department of safety for a hearing and
 
02:04:18.629 --> 02:04:18.639 align:start position:0%
have um what Mr Wally agreed would be a
 
02:04:21.910 --> 02:04:21.920 align:start position:0%
uh reasonable and fair decision that it
 
02:04:23.910 --> 02:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
would have truncated the period of
 
02:04:26.430 --> 02:04:26.440 align:start position:0%
conflict and and maybe emotions wouldn't
 
02:04:29.990 --> 02:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
have gotten so so severe I would
 
02:04:31.750 --> 02:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate your definition of the word
 
02:04:35.510 --> 02:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
truncated before okay well for instance
 
02:04:38.830 --> 02:04:38.840 align:start position:0%
if it had taken let's say two seasons of
 
02:04:41.669 --> 02:04:41.679 align:start position:0%
conflict with a neighbor um do you think
 
02:04:43.790 --> 02:04:43.800 align:start position:0%
if this bill were to pass and Neighbors
 
02:04:45.950 --> 02:04:45.960 align:start position:0%
from the from the onset were able to
 
02:04:47.870 --> 02:04:47.880 align:start position:0%
petition the department of safety for a
 
02:04:51.149 --> 02:04:51.159 align:start position:0%
hearing that having the conflict only
 
02:04:54.950 --> 02:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
maybe be for you know a few months a
 
02:04:58.109 --> 02:04:58.119 align:start position:0%
year at the most before an objective uh
 
02:05:01.830 --> 02:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
decision was rendered that it would have
 
02:05:04.109 --> 02:05:04.119 align:start position:0%
been easier for those neighbors to abide
 
02:05:07.030 --> 02:05:07.040 align:start position:0%
by that or at least have less harsh
 
02:05:09.589 --> 02:05:09.599 align:start position:0%
feelings against each other I think
 
02:05:10.950 --> 02:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
people would still have their own
 
02:05:14.510 --> 02:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
feelings about wake boats and activity
 
02:05:18.270 --> 02:05:18.280 align:start position:0%
but if it were prescribed by law that
 
02:05:19.990 --> 02:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
they were not wake Boats were not
 
02:05:22.470 --> 02:05:22.480 align:start position:0%
permitted on a certain body of water it
 
02:05:25.589 --> 02:05:25.599 align:start position:0%
would take away in great measure the uh
 
02:05:27.709 --> 02:05:27.719 align:start position:0%
backstabbing and the snide comments
 
02:05:29.390 --> 02:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
because people would say well this is
 
02:05:31.310 --> 02:05:31.320 align:start position:0%
what I really think it's like politics
 
02:05:33.229 --> 02:05:33.239 align:start position:0%
you talk politics but can still go out
 
02:05:35.510 --> 02:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
and drink a cup of coffee afterward but
 
02:05:36.910 --> 02:05:36.920 align:start position:0%
this is the law and this is what we're
 
02:05:38.430 --> 02:05:38.440 align:start position:0%
going to need to abide by I think it
 
02:05:40.229 --> 02:05:40.239 align:start position:0%
would really
 
02:05:43.510 --> 02:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
amarate uh in the long run the
 
02:05:45.950 --> 02:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
rangerous discussions that otherwise
 
02:05:47.750 --> 02:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
people would have especially if one of
 
02:05:50.189 --> 02:05:50.199 align:start position:0%
those individuals owned the Wake boat
 
02:05:51.629 --> 02:05:51.639 align:start position:0%
that creates
 
02:05:55.910 --> 02:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
a it creates a a mix of constant
 
02:05:58.030 --> 02:05:58.040 align:start position:0%
conflict I'll see it that way thank you
 
02:05:58.040 --> 02:05:58.790 align:start position:0%
conflict I'll see it that way thank you
very

02:05:58.790 --> 02:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
very
 
02:06:01.709 --> 02:06:01.719 align:start position:0%
much any other questions for our
 
02:06:03.950 --> 02:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
speaker seeing none thank you very much
 
02:06:05.589 --> 02:06:05.599 align:start position:0%
for your
 
02:06:08.390 --> 02:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
testimony next to speak in opposition
 
02:06:17.589 --> 02:06:17.599 align:start position:0%

record my name is jod grimus I work with
 
02:06:54.390 --> 02:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Jody grimus
 
02:06:55.470 --> 02:06:55.480 align:start position:0%
and I work with the New Hampshire Marine

02:06:59.390 --> 02:06:59.400 align:start position:0%
sport industry Association that are here
 
02:07:02.109 --> 02:07:02.119 align:start position:0%
in opposition to this bill um since the
 
02:07:03.950 --> 02:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
posting of this hearing I have been
 
02:07:06.669 --> 02:07:06.679 align:start position:0%
Fielding as you I'm sure calls and
 
02:07:09.390 --> 02:07:09.400 align:start position:0%
emails from very frantic families who
 
02:07:11.629 --> 02:07:11.639 align:start position:0%
fortunately cannot be here today because
 
02:07:14.709 --> 02:07:14.719 align:start position:0%
they are working um about their concerns
 
02:07:17.510 --> 02:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
about this bill so I have taken the
 
02:07:17.520 --> 02:07:19.270 align:start position:0%
about this bill so I have taken the
Liberty

02:07:19.270 --> 02:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
Liberty
 
02:07:21.750 --> 02:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
of printing out their testimony there's
 
02:07:23.510 --> 02:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
about 200 letters here I couldn't get to
 
02:07:26.350 --> 02:07:26.360 align:start position:0%
them all there would be more I would try
 
02:07:27.830 --> 02:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
to do that over the
 
02:07:31.149 --> 02:07:31.159 align:start position:0%
weekend um just to make sure that it
 
02:07:33.990 --> 02:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
their comments and their testimony and
 
02:07:35.229 --> 02:07:35.239 align:start position:0%
their opposition is held and there are a
 
02:07:37.390 --> 02:07:37.400 align:start position:0%
lot of New Hampshire families there are
 
02:07:39.790 --> 02:07:39.800 align:start position:0%
a few from Massachusetts and other
 
02:07:41.109 --> 02:07:41.119 align:start position:0%
states but
 
02:07:43.790 --> 02:07:43.800 align:start position:0%
predominantly they are New Hampshire
 
02:07:46.870 --> 02:07:46.880 align:start position:0%
families why are they so
 
02:07:48.830 --> 02:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
concerned can we talk about about that
 
02:07:52.109 --> 02:07:52.119 align:start position:0%
hearing process for a minute um that
 
02:07:54.629 --> 02:07:54.639 align:start position:0%
hearing process is in statute is in
 
02:07:56.549 --> 02:07:56.559 align:start position:0%
statute for certain things it is in
 
02:07:59.069 --> 02:07:59.079 align:start position:0%
statute for um whether or not you want
 
02:08:00.510 --> 02:08:00.520 align:start position:0%
to look at a particular body of water
 
02:08:02.109 --> 02:08:02.119 align:start position:0%
and not have petroleum Motors on it
 
02:08:03.910 --> 02:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
maybe it's an electric motor paddle
 
02:08:06.430 --> 02:08:06.440 align:start position:0%
board pedal craft kind of
 
02:08:10.149 --> 02:08:10.159 align:start position:0%
Lake um maybe it's a no wake zone if
 
02:08:13.109 --> 02:08:13.119 align:start position:0%
there is a sensitive area on a lake body
 
02:08:15.189 --> 02:08:15.199 align:start position:0%
that is concerned about wakes I would
 
02:08:17.270 --> 02:08:17.280 align:start position:0%
suggest they go through the no wake zone
 
02:08:20.510 --> 02:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
petition because that packs all boats
 
02:08:22.629 --> 02:08:22.639 align:start position:0%
not just one doesn't single out any type
 
02:08:26.069 --> 02:08:26.079 align:start position:0%
of activity it deals with one boat uh
 
02:08:28.990 --> 02:08:29.000 align:start position:0%
one one for all
 
02:08:33.109 --> 02:08:33.119 align:start position:0%
boats in talking and looking up the
 
02:08:33.119 --> 02:08:35.390 align:start position:0%
boats in talking and looking up the
petition

02:08:35.390 --> 02:08:35.400 align:start position:0%
petition
 
02:08:38.229 --> 02:08:38.239 align:start position:0%
process the Bureau of hearings does more
 
02:08:40.750 --> 02:08:40.760 align:start position:0%
than just watercraft type hearings the
 
02:08:43.390 --> 02:08:43.400 align:start position:0%
Bureau of hearings handles all of the
 
02:08:46.830 --> 02:08:46.840 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle um statutes and rules and
 
02:08:49.430 --> 02:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
hearings at the Department of Safety
 
02:08:51.310 --> 02:08:51.320 align:start position:0%
if you look at the
 
02:08:55.549 --> 02:08:55.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:57.750 --> 02:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
prioritizes commissioner shall hear all
 
02:08:59.669 --> 02:08:59.679 align:start position:0%
petitions as soon as possible after they
 
02:09:01.589 --> 02:09:01.599 align:start position:0%
are submitted when will they be
 
02:09:02.910 --> 02:09:02.920 align:start position:0%
submitted when will they be heard will
 
02:09:04.629 --> 02:09:04.639 align:start position:0%
they be heard in the December time frame
 
02:09:06.950 --> 02:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
January time frame because those no wake
 
02:09:09.510 --> 02:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
zones by law required to be in June July
 
02:09:12.069 --> 02:09:12.079 align:start position:0%
August so that people are there this
 
02:09:13.750 --> 02:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't have that requirement so you
 
02:09:16.109 --> 02:09:16.119 align:start position:0%
could have these hearings in February
 
02:09:17.830 --> 02:09:17.840 align:start position:0%
when nobody's around nobody has any idea
 
02:09:19.750 --> 02:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
what's happening
 
02:09:22.069 --> 02:09:22.079 align:start position:0%
again second you are asking the
 
02:09:26.229 --> 02:09:26.239 align:start position:0%
commissioner to give these hearings the
 
02:09:29.310 --> 02:09:29.320 align:start position:0%
priority so is it a priority over the
 
02:09:32.030 --> 02:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
DWI hearing the hearing at the
 
02:09:35.030 --> 02:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
department of safety for fatal accidents
 
02:09:39.510 --> 02:09:39.520 align:start position:0%
for youth operator problems for reckless
 
02:09:42.189 --> 02:09:42.199 align:start position:0%
operation are we going to
 
02:09:45.030 --> 02:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
prioritize the petition to take
 
02:09:48.030 --> 02:09:48.040 align:start position:0%
law-abiding citizens off a body of water
 
02:09:51.669 --> 02:09:51.679 align:start position:0%
is that more important than those
 
02:09:55.390 --> 02:09:55.400 align:start position:0%
alcohol uh DWI interlock ignition
 
02:09:57.629 --> 02:09:57.639 align:start position:0%
hearings Etc there are a lot of hearings
 
02:09:58.589 --> 02:09:58.599 align:start position:0%
that are done at the department of
 
02:10:01.510 --> 02:10:01.520 align:start position:0%
safety this being the priority I would
 
02:10:03.870 --> 02:10:03.880 align:start position:0%
question and I would ask your
 
02:10:05.709 --> 02:10:05.719 align:start position:0%
consideration looking at the department
 
02:10:08.709 --> 02:10:08.719 align:start position:0%
of safety's hearings in 2023 there was
 
02:10:11.030 --> 02:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
one hearing relative to a
 
02:10:14.510 --> 02:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
petroleum-based motor um question on a
 
02:10:19.310 --> 02:10:19.320 align:start position:0%
body of water one I can tell you this es
 
02:10:21.910 --> 02:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
with what I saw on the online testimoni
 
02:10:26.549 --> 02:10:26.559 align:start position:0%
of 650 people opposed and 388 supported
 
02:10:27.709 --> 02:10:27.719 align:start position:0%
I would suggest you're going to have a
 
02:10:29.549 --> 02:10:29.559 align:start position:0%
lot of hearings that are all of a sudden
 
02:10:32.549 --> 02:10:32.559 align:start position:0%
going to get prioritized over anything
 
02:10:35.830 --> 02:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
else in 2022 there were six hearings
 
02:10:39.229 --> 02:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
relative to watercraft three on Moorings
 
02:10:43.310 --> 02:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
two on rafting and one
 
02:10:46.109 --> 02:10:46.119 align:start position:0%
on something else SE
 
02:10:48.790 --> 02:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
planes so I would suggest and I have
 
02:10:50.790 --> 02:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
spoken with the commissioner's office
 
02:10:52.910 --> 02:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
they are not prepared to take on this
 
02:10:55.310 --> 02:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
bill they do not have the resources I
 
02:10:56.669 --> 02:10:56.679 align:start position:0%
would asked that you might want to talk
 
02:10:57.870 --> 02:10:57.880 align:start position:0%
to them about whether or not there's a
 
02:10:59.669 --> 02:10:59.679 align:start position:0%
fiscal note required for this bill
 
02:11:02.149 --> 02:11:02.159 align:start position:0%
because it is a significant change in
 
02:11:03.629 --> 02:11:03.639 align:start position:0%
what the department of safety Bureau of
 
02:11:06.149 --> 02:11:06.159 align:start position:0%
hearings has to do again they do not
 
02:11:08.069 --> 02:11:08.079 align:start position:0%
just deal with watercraft hearings I
 
02:11:10.109 --> 02:11:10.119 align:start position:0%
would hope they would prioritize that
 
02:11:12.189 --> 02:11:12.199 align:start position:0%
reckless driver in suspending their
 
02:11:14.310 --> 02:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
license over
 
02:11:17.669 --> 02:11:17.679 align:start position:0%
this um again a lot of people could not
 
02:11:19.830 --> 02:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
come today
 
02:11:21.750 --> 02:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry about that they're very sorry
 
02:11:24.229 --> 02:11:24.239 align:start position:0%
they're very nervous about it um I think
 
02:11:25.629 --> 02:11:25.639 align:start position:0%
you have to think about a lot of things
 
02:11:27.589 --> 02:11:27.599 align:start position:0%
when it comes to Safe passage do you
 
02:11:29.350 --> 02:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
know that New Hampshire has one of the
 
02:11:33.350 --> 02:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
the broadest safe passage laws in the
 
02:11:36.069 --> 02:11:36.079 align:start position:0%
country Most states have 100 foot safe
 
02:11:38.950 --> 02:11:38.960 align:start position:0%
passage some have less than that they
 
02:11:40.790 --> 02:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
have all the same boating but New
 
02:11:43.669 --> 02:11:43.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does we have 150 I think
 
02:11:45.549 --> 02:11:45.559 align:start position:0%
Vermont has 200 there's a couple of
 
02:11:47.189 --> 02:11:47.199 align:start position:0%
other states that have stronger if you
 
02:11:49.350 --> 02:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
want to talk about safy passage let's
 
02:11:51.990 --> 02:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
talk about safe passage for all boats
 
02:11:55.470 --> 02:11:55.480 align:start position:0%
stop singling out one activity and you
 
02:11:57.229 --> 02:11:57.239 align:start position:0%
really can't single out one boat even as
 
02:11:58.589 --> 02:11:58.599 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
 
02:12:01.109 --> 02:12:01.119 align:start position:0%
said because quite honestly you can wake
 
02:12:03.030 --> 02:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
surf behind a lot of different boats
 
02:12:06.270 --> 02:12:06.280 align:start position:0%
I'll bring pictures it is not just one
 
02:12:08.350 --> 02:12:08.360 align:start position:0%
toe booat it can be a lot of different
 
02:12:11.830 --> 02:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
boats so there's a lot of issues that I
 
02:12:13.030 --> 02:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
think still and I'll follow up in
 
02:12:14.350 --> 02:12:14.360 align:start position:0%
writing with any other questions that
 
02:12:18.109 --> 02:12:18.119 align:start position:0%
may have but when it comes to as as
 
02:12:19.990 --> 02:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
prior testimony disturbing the sentiment
 
02:12:22.109 --> 02:12:22.119 align:start position:0%
of the bottom anybody that brings up an
 
02:12:24.069 --> 02:12:24.079 align:start position:0%
anchor takes up half the lake bottom
 
02:12:26.549 --> 02:12:26.559 align:start position:0%
with them everybody that takes up an
 
02:12:30.069 --> 02:12:30.079 align:start position:0%
anchor takes up the bottom of the lake
 
02:12:32.189 --> 02:12:32.199 align:start position:0%
so are we going to stop boating are we
 
02:12:33.950 --> 02:12:33.960 align:start position:0%
going to stop anchoring are we going to
 
02:12:36.950 --> 02:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
keep singling out where does it stop
 
02:12:39.950 --> 02:12:39.960 align:start position:0%
again a lot of families are very
 
02:12:41.870 --> 02:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
concerned about what this bill is going
 
02:12:44.910 --> 02:12:44.920 align:start position:0%
to do to their Recreation their time
 
02:12:46.870 --> 02:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
frame everybody works hard they like
 
02:12:48.549 --> 02:12:48.559 align:start position:0%
little enjoyment it's their their mental
 
02:12:50.549 --> 02:12:50.559 align:start position:0%
health break and we're going to take
 
02:12:53.629 --> 02:12:53.639 align:start position:0%
that away so please oppose the bill I
 
02:12:55.270 --> 02:12:55.280 align:start position:0%
will leave this for you I will follow up
 
02:12:56.910 --> 02:12:56.920 align:start position:0%
with anything else in writing and I
 
02:12:58.510 --> 02:12:58.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate your time there's a lot of
 
02:12:59.750 --> 02:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
other people behind me so I'll leave it
 
02:13:02.990 --> 02:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
at that you take
 
02:13:06.069 --> 02:13:06.079 align:start position:0%
question does anyone have a
 
02:13:08.750 --> 02:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
02:13:11.149 --> 02:13:11.159 align:start position:0%
Ron thank you very much Mr chair and
 
02:13:13.430 --> 02:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um at
 
02:13:14.870 --> 02:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
the beginning of your remarks you
 
02:13:18.790 --> 02:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned about um that this B may
 
02:13:21.310 --> 02:13:21.320 align:start position:0%
require or may may hold public hearings
 
02:13:24.270 --> 02:13:24.280 align:start position:0%
in the winter when many residents aren't
 
02:13:27.510 --> 02:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
aware that um there is a hearing that
 
02:13:30.510 --> 02:13:30.520 align:start position:0%
may impact their ability to use a wake
 
02:13:34.069 --> 02:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
booat but you brought us a whole stack
 
02:13:37.950 --> 02:13:37.960 align:start position:0%
of testimony on this bill and we're in
 
02:13:40.669 --> 02:13:40.679 align:start position:0%
the end of January and I'm wondering
 
02:13:43.149 --> 02:13:43.159 align:start position:0%
wouldn't these people know about a
 
02:13:45.549 --> 02:13:45.559 align:start position:0%
hearing if they knew about this hearing
 
02:13:47.589 --> 02:13:47.599 align:start position:0%
I don't know that to be the case quite
 
02:13:50.270 --> 02:13:50.280 align:start position:0%
honestly ly um it's taken a lot of
 
02:13:53.669 --> 02:13:53.679 align:start position:0%
effort to try to let as many people know
 
02:13:55.669 --> 02:13:55.679 align:start position:0%
that this is taking place this hearing
 
02:13:57.069 --> 02:13:57.079 align:start position:0%
do I know that they're going to know
 
02:13:59.669 --> 02:13:59.679 align:start position:0%
about a little lake or some Lake
 
02:14:01.549 --> 02:14:01.559 align:start position:0%
somewhere I don't know that I don't have
 
02:14:03.709 --> 02:14:03.719 align:start position:0%
the ability to track all of that okay
 
02:14:07.790 --> 02:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
follow up M um and I I just mainly
 
02:14:10.350 --> 02:14:10.360 align:start position:0%
comment these are all printouts of
 
02:14:12.950 --> 02:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
online testimony we can see that so you
 
02:14:15.069 --> 02:14:15.079 align:start position:0%
could have saved a lot of paper that's
 
02:14:17.430 --> 02:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
okay I just I had gotten frantic calls
 
02:14:19.510 --> 02:14:19.520 align:start position:0%
saying will they look at that and I go I
 
02:14:21.830 --> 02:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
have no idea I don't know if if members
 
02:14:23.750 --> 02:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
go into the online testimony system all
 
02:14:25.990 --> 02:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
the time or not I think it depends on
 
02:14:29.549 --> 02:14:29.559 align:start position:0%
the member so quite honestly I want I
 
02:14:31.950 --> 02:14:31.960 align:start position:0%
I'm doing my fair share no I I
 
02:14:33.589 --> 02:14:33.599 align:start position:0%
appreciate it it's just most of these
 
02:14:37.109 --> 02:14:37.119 align:start position:0%
only have one sentence on them so it's
 
02:14:39.390 --> 02:14:39.400 align:start position:0%
uh just want I I do go into online
 
02:14:42.990 --> 02:14:43.000 align:start position:0%
testimony and uh just one more question
 
02:14:45.189 --> 02:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
when when you're talking about the the
 
02:14:48.470 --> 02:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
boats or possible regulation of boats
 
02:14:50.950 --> 02:14:50.960 align:start position:0%
depending on the outcome of a hearing
 
02:14:53.390 --> 02:14:53.400 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Safety do you see
 
02:14:55.910 --> 02:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
a difference between the impact of a
 
02:14:58.350 --> 02:14:58.360 align:start position:0%
wake boat compared to other
 
02:15:01.950 --> 02:15:01.960 align:start position:0%
boats no because
 
02:15:05.430 --> 02:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
again there can be folks driving other
 
02:15:08.030 --> 02:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
types of boats that are not doing so
 
02:15:10.790 --> 02:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
appropriately and can create impact so
 
02:15:10.800 --> 02:15:11.589 align:start position:0%
appropriately and can create impact so
whether

02:15:11.589 --> 02:15:11.599 align:start position:0%
whether
 
02:15:14.790 --> 02:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
it's uh the cabin crews are going by the
 
02:15:17.390 --> 02:15:17.400 align:start position:0%
this the that um there's a million
 
02:15:19.109 --> 02:15:19.119 align:start position:0%
different things that we have all seen
 
02:15:21.149 --> 02:15:21.159 align:start position:0%
on our Lakes where people are just not
 
02:15:23.669 --> 02:15:23.679 align:start position:0%
operating appropriately that can cause
 
02:15:26.870 --> 02:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
impact and so if they're not currently
 
02:15:28.950 --> 02:15:28.960 align:start position:0%
obeying the current laws we need to
 
02:15:30.589 --> 02:15:30.599 align:start position:0%
educate them and we need to give Marine
 
02:15:33.549 --> 02:15:33.559 align:start position:0%
Patrol the ability to enforce those are
 
02:15:35.189 --> 02:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
the issues that we need to address
 
02:15:39.870 --> 02:15:39.880 align:start position:0%
versus picking out individual sports or
 
02:15:43.870 --> 02:15:43.880 align:start position:0%
boats for this type of restruction okay
 
02:15:46.270 --> 02:15:46.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair any other questions
 
02:15:48.870 --> 02:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
for our speaker yeah
 
02:15:51.830 --> 02:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony do you have
 
02:15:54.229 --> 02:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
excuse me do you have copy of your of
 
02:15:54.239 --> 02:15:55.629 align:start position:0%
excuse me do you have copy of your of
your

02:15:55.629 --> 02:15:55.639 align:start position:0%
your
 
02:15:58.990 --> 02:15:59.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:01.990 --> 02:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
you speaking in support of the
 
02:16:04.709 --> 02:16:04.719 align:start position:0%
bill I hope I say your last name
 
02:16:10.790 --> 02:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:14.870 --> 02:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
Colleen good morning um I just wanted to
 
02:16:18.910 --> 02:16:18.920 align:start position:0%
express my concern um on Arlington pond
 
02:16:20.350 --> 02:16:20.360 align:start position:0%
in Salem New
 
02:16:25.470 --> 02:16:25.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um Arlington Pond is very long
 
02:16:29.149 --> 02:16:29.159 align:start position:0%
very narrow Lake um there's only like
 
02:16:32.429 --> 02:16:32.439 align:start position:0%
one really big part of the lake that you
 
02:16:32.439 --> 02:16:33.270 align:start position:0%
one really big part of the lake that you
can

02:16:33.270 --> 02:16:33.280 align:start position:0%
can
 
02:16:36.389 --> 02:16:36.399 align:start position:0%
actually ski safely because of the
 
02:16:38.950 --> 02:16:38.960 align:start position:0%
activity that we have there's so many
 
02:16:40.669 --> 02:16:40.679 align:start position:0%
people out in the summer especially with
 
02:16:44.709 --> 02:16:44.719 align:start position:0%
the co um everybody wants to be outside
 
02:16:47.150 --> 02:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
and I agree and I love activity and I
 
02:16:50.750 --> 02:16:50.760 align:start position:0%
love seeing everybody out having fun the
 
02:16:53.349 --> 02:16:53.359 align:start position:0%
only problem with our leag is that the
 
02:16:55.950 --> 02:16:55.960 align:start position:0%
depth of our leag is has an average of
 
02:17:00.709 --> 02:17:00.719 align:start position:0%
10 feet so I went around with my son's
 
02:17:03.070 --> 02:17:03.080 align:start position:0%
uh fishing boat and I put the depth
 
02:17:06.870 --> 02:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
binder on and everywhere where the boats
 
02:17:10.469 --> 02:17:10.479 align:start position:0%
go mostly and I don't know if people
 
02:17:12.270 --> 02:17:12.280 align:start position:0%
have their look at their dep HS but
 
02:17:15.629 --> 02:17:15.639 align:start position:0%
you're looking at five feet so a regular
 
02:17:18.950 --> 02:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
boat you know can handle that but with
 
02:17:22.349 --> 02:17:22.359 align:start position:0%
the ballister um the boat drops and as
 
02:17:24.190 --> 02:17:24.200 align:start position:0%
you know those boats I can hold the
 
02:17:26.349 --> 02:17:26.359 align:start position:0%
water which makes the boat go down so
 
02:17:29.469 --> 02:17:29.479 align:start position:0%
that they make the big waves for the
 
02:17:31.669 --> 02:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
wake surfing which is what they want
 
02:17:34.870 --> 02:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
they want the big wake um to have fun
 
02:17:37.469 --> 02:17:37.479 align:start position:0%
and which is awesome but I just think on
 
02:17:40.910 --> 02:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
Allington fond we're experiencing a lot
 
02:17:44.990 --> 02:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
we have the Sino bacteria Bloom um we're
 
02:17:48.469 --> 02:17:48.479 align:start position:0%
really seeing a lot more erosion and I
 
02:17:51.190 --> 02:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
just think that they should look at the
 
02:17:53.349 --> 02:17:53.359 align:start position:0%
lakes that they go on and and just find
 
02:17:54.910 --> 02:17:54.920 align:start position:0%
the lake that is
 
02:17:59.110 --> 02:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
deeper that can handle the lodge
 
02:18:02.870 --> 02:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
waves and not dragging on the bottom
 
02:18:04.629 --> 02:18:04.639 align:start position:0%
because every lake has Sun bacteria
 
02:18:08.589 --> 02:18:08.599 align:start position:0%
Bloom but they're disturbing it and we
 
02:18:11.190 --> 02:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
didn't get to swim all last summer but
 
02:18:13.309 --> 02:18:13.319 align:start position:0%
yet the boats were still out there I
 
02:18:15.429 --> 02:18:15.439 align:start position:0%
have videos that they were still out
 
02:18:17.830 --> 02:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
there because it's a choice you can swim
 
02:18:19.990 --> 02:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
in a lake if there's nobody saying you
 
02:18:21.389 --> 02:18:21.399 align:start position:0%
can't go out and swim with sign now
 
02:18:24.030 --> 02:18:24.040 align:start position:0%
bacteria Bloom but by choice you know we
 
02:18:25.830 --> 02:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
didn't because you know I don't want to
 
02:18:28.309 --> 02:18:28.319 align:start position:0%
take a chance but you know they were all
 
02:18:29.910 --> 02:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
still out there we have five or six
 
02:18:32.270 --> 02:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
boats at a time and it's absolutely
 
02:18:35.230 --> 02:18:35.240 align:start position:0%
impossible for them to stay at least 150
 
02:18:38.230 --> 02:18:38.240 align:start position:0%
feet from Shore because our lake is so
 
02:18:41.549 --> 02:18:41.559 align:start position:0%
narrow and we don't have the depth
 
02:18:43.910 --> 02:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
because it's you can go around and
 
02:18:45.950 --> 02:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
anyone on the lake can go around the
 
02:18:48.830 --> 02:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
only part of our Lake actually is deep
 
02:18:51.589 --> 02:18:51.599 align:start position:0%
is the center that would mean one boat
 
02:18:53.429 --> 02:18:53.439 align:start position:0%
at a time could go down the center of
 
02:18:55.309 --> 02:18:55.319 align:start position:0%
our Our Lake because it's 20
 
02:18:59.190 --> 02:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
feet and then over by the DM but again
 
02:19:01.830 --> 02:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
we have numerous like people are out I
 
02:19:04.549 --> 02:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
mean people are anchoring like you said
 
02:19:06.549 --> 02:19:06.559 align:start position:0%
um you know people trying to do other
 
02:19:08.790 --> 02:19:08.800 align:start position:0%
things as well so it's it's becoming
 
02:19:12.110 --> 02:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
unsafe as well they can't handle Arley
 
02:19:14.230 --> 02:19:14.240 align:start position:0%
can't handle it and I feel bad because I
 
02:19:16.070 --> 02:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
have people and I don't want to cause
 
02:19:18.349 --> 02:19:18.359 align:start position:0%
problems like I have on our Lake that
 
02:19:19.910 --> 02:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
our friends that have these types of
 
02:19:22.509 --> 02:19:22.519 align:start position:0%
Vats it's just that unfortunately our
 
02:19:25.990 --> 02:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
lake is too it's not deep
 
02:19:28.230 --> 02:19:28.240 align:start position:0%
enough and that's all I would like to
 
02:19:32.309 --> 02:19:32.319 align:start position:0%
say thank you any questions for the
 
02:19:35.549 --> 02:19:35.559 align:start position:0%
speaker representative R thank you Mr
 
02:19:38.509 --> 02:19:38.519 align:start position:0%
chair um did you know that Arlington M
 
02:19:41.070 --> 02:19:41.080 align:start position:0%
Pond also serves as a municipal drinking
 
02:19:44.230 --> 02:19:44.240 align:start position:0%
water source for the town of Salem and
 
02:19:46.549 --> 02:19:46.559 align:start position:0%
that if blooms are encouraged in the
 
02:19:49.670 --> 02:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
lake um either through sediment
 
02:19:52.389 --> 02:19:52.399 align:start position:0%
disruption or erosion or other means of
 
02:19:55.750 --> 02:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
having phosphorus enter the lake that it
 
02:19:59.270 --> 02:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
um demands an immediate cessation of
 
02:20:02.230 --> 02:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
that water draw and the town of Salem
 
02:20:04.389 --> 02:20:04.399 align:start position:0%
has to go to other sources for their
 
02:20:08.349 --> 02:20:08.359 align:start position:0%
Municipal Water our lake is a secondary
 
02:20:11.630 --> 02:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
source keny lake is a primary we also
 
02:20:14.030 --> 02:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
have a h pipeline that comes from
 
02:20:16.630 --> 02:20:16.640 align:start position:0%
Manchester New Hampshire which supplies
 
02:20:20.150 --> 02:20:20.160 align:start position:0%
water so um they take our water but they
 
02:20:22.270 --> 02:20:22.280 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily use it it goes into a
 
02:20:25.670 --> 02:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
treatment plant before
 
02:20:28.790 --> 02:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
it is ever it goes directly into like a
 
02:20:31.230 --> 02:20:31.240 align:start position:0%
treatment PL does not go directly into
 
02:20:31.240 --> 02:20:35.190 align:start position:0%
treatment PL does not go directly into
anyone's

02:20:35.190 --> 02:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:37.349 --> 02:20:37.359 align:start position:0%
drinking are you aware that that
 
02:20:40.270 --> 02:20:40.280 align:start position:0%
treatment may not remove cyanotoxins
 
02:20:42.910 --> 02:20:42.920 align:start position:0%
that may be present in the water I can't
 
02:20:49.710 --> 02:20:49.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:51.270 --> 02:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
I don't know the answer to that question
 
02:20:53.710 --> 02:20:53.720 align:start position:0%
I just know that our pond is a it is a
 
02:20:57.750 --> 02:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
manmade pond and it was brought that we
 
02:21:00.469 --> 02:21:00.479 align:start position:0%
are a secondary water source but again
 
02:21:02.510 --> 02:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
we have the pipeline coming from manesa
 
02:21:05.389 --> 02:21:05.399 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so I don't know how much
 
02:21:07.830 --> 02:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
they use it but we are still considered
 
02:21:11.469 --> 02:21:11.479 align:start position:0%
a um secondary water source so it's up
 
02:21:14.230 --> 02:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
to the town of Salem which they are um
 
02:21:16.630 --> 02:21:16.640 align:start position:0%
addressing this issue as well we are
 
02:21:16.640 --> 02:21:17.750 align:start position:0%
addressing this issue as well we are
working

02:21:17.750 --> 02:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
working
 
02:21:22.510 --> 02:21:22.520 align:start position:0%
watered and stuff like that but um as
 
02:21:25.309 --> 02:21:25.319 align:start position:0%
far as you know the depth of our pond is
 
02:21:27.870 --> 02:21:27.880 align:start position:0%
the biggest concern because every lake
 
02:21:30.389 --> 02:21:30.399 align:start position:0%
has thel bacteria blooms I just think
 
02:21:33.110 --> 02:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
the boats need they need I think um it
 
02:21:34.950 --> 02:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
was brought up before they need at least
 
02:21:34.960 --> 02:21:38.710 align:start position:0%
was brought up before they need at least
15

02:21:38.710 --> 02:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:41.309 --> 02:21:41.319 align:start position:0%
feet I just want to repeat again for
 
02:21:44.190 --> 02:21:44.200 align:start position:0%
those that might have come in um for the
 
02:21:44.200 --> 02:21:45.950 align:start position:0%
those that might have come in um for the
11:00

02:21:45.950 --> 02:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
11:00
 
02:21:47.790 --> 02:21:47.800 align:start position:0%
hb401 f
 
02:21:50.790 --> 02:21:50.800 align:start position:0%
about the Silver Lake Park Transfer the
 
02:21:52.950 --> 02:21:52.960 align:start position:0%

waters and does not uh appropriately
 
02:24:11.349 --> 02:24:11.359 align:start position:0%
address or increase water safety I urge
 
02:24:13.469 --> 02:24:13.479 align:start position:0%
you to consider uh opposing this
 
02:24:14.990 --> 02:24:15.000 align:start position:0%

chair and thank you for taking my
 
02:24:24.030 --> 02:24:24.040 align:start position:0%
question this is the same question I
 
02:24:27.710 --> 02:24:27.720 align:start position:0%
asked Mr um Wall-E but do you think that
 
02:24:30.750 --> 02:24:30.760 align:start position:0%
a decision should should the residents
 
02:24:32.790 --> 02:24:32.800 align:start position:0%
um be successful in submitting a
 
02:24:34.389 --> 02:24:34.399 align:start position:0%
petition for a hearing with the
 
02:24:36.750 --> 02:24:36.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety do you believe the
 
02:24:38.309 --> 02:24:38.319 align:start position:0%
department of safety can make a
 
02:24:41.830 --> 02:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
reasonable and fair judgment on any
 
02:24:44.150 --> 02:24:44.160 align:start position:0%
restrictions to wake boats in a body of
 
02:24:46.590 --> 02:24:46.600 align:start position:0%
water chairman of members I do trust law
 
02:24:48.469 --> 02:24:48.479 align:start position:0%
enforcement however I would say and one
 
02:24:50.830 --> 02:24:50.840 align:start position:0%
of my larger concerns with this bill is
 
02:24:53.510 --> 02:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
just creating a patchwork Statewide um I
 
02:24:54.910 --> 02:24:54.920 align:start position:0%
don't like to speak in anecdotes but I'm
 
02:24:55.950 --> 02:24:55.960 align:start position:0%
going to throw one out here really
 
02:24:57.830 --> 02:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
quickly uh say we all live on a block
 
02:25:00.070 --> 02:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
the speed limits 30 miles an hour and
 
02:25:01.389 --> 02:25:01.399 align:start position:0%
there's someone that comes by every day
 
02:25:03.510 --> 02:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
at 45 are we going to lower that speed
 
02:25:05.830 --> 02:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
limit to 15 or are we going to put up
 
02:25:07.590 --> 02:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
one of those signs that says your speed
 
02:25:09.110 --> 02:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
maybe pull this person over have a
 
02:25:11.389 --> 02:25:11.399 align:start position:0%
conversation I think it's best to focus
 
02:25:13.630 --> 02:25:13.640 align:start position:0%
on you know educating that driver or
 
02:25:15.710 --> 02:25:15.720 align:start position:0%
Boer as opposed to having these
 
02:25:17.670 --> 02:25:17.680 align:start position:0%
patchworks pop up around the
 
02:25:20.070 --> 02:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
State okay thank you thank
 
02:25:22.830 --> 02:25:22.840 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
02:25:26.790 --> 02:25:26.800 align:start position:0%
wolf do you think that there is a
 
02:25:26.800 --> 02:25:30.110 align:start position:0%
wolf do you think that there is a
possibility

02:25:30.110 --> 02:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:30.120 --> 02:25:31.950 align:start position:0%
 
of

02:25:31.950 --> 02:25:31.960 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:25:34.510 --> 02:25:34.520 align:start position:0%
a hate to use the word
 
02:25:40.950 --> 02:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
restriction but uh of a place of use so
 
02:25:45.070 --> 02:25:45.080 align:start position:0%
that we don't go into this Pat for quilt
 
02:25:48.550 --> 02:25:48.560 align:start position:0%
of Regulation that but it is a
 
02:25:51.429 --> 02:25:51.439 align:start position:0%
Statewide educational looking at the
 
02:25:54.230 --> 02:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
science of where it is and having the
 
02:25:58.030 --> 02:25:58.040 align:start position:0%
same thing same rules Statewide as
 
02:25:58.040 --> 02:25:59.389 align:start position:0%
same thing same rules Statewide as
opposed

02:25:59.389 --> 02:25:59.399 align:start position:0%
opposed
 
02:26:03.790 --> 02:26:03.800 align:start position:0%
to individual Lakes chairman of members
 
02:26:05.710 --> 02:26:05.720 align:start position:0%
yeah I you know your current law I
 
02:26:08.030 --> 02:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
believe is 150 foot offset so any part
 
02:26:09.790 --> 02:26:09.800 align:start position:0%
of the lake that's less than 300 feet
 
02:26:11.389 --> 02:26:11.399 align:start position:0%
you know wide they shouldn't be you know
 
02:26:14.349 --> 02:26:14.359 align:start position:0%
operating there at all um as the water
 
02:26:16.030 --> 02:26:16.040 align:start position:0%
sports industry Association we are in
 
02:26:17.309 --> 02:26:17.319 align:start position:0%
favor of 200
 
02:26:19.830 --> 02:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
we've done two peerreview research
 
02:26:21.349 --> 02:26:21.359 align:start position:0%
studies that have shown that if you're
 
02:26:24.550 --> 02:26:24.560 align:start position:0%
if you're 200t or more from Shore um
 
02:26:26.030 --> 02:26:26.040 align:start position:0%
you're going to have the same impact as
 
02:26:28.030 --> 02:26:28.040 align:start position:0%
a wind driven
 
02:26:30.469 --> 02:26:30.479 align:start position:0%
wake one follower have you done any
 
02:26:33.590 --> 02:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
studies in regard to depth chairman
 
02:26:35.150 --> 02:26:35.160 align:start position:0%
members uh no there's no current study
 
02:26:37.469 --> 02:26:37.479 align:start position:0%
on that right now um in one of the peer
 
02:26:40.349 --> 02:26:40.359 align:start position:0%
reviewed studies generally he said um
 
02:26:44.790 --> 02:26:44.800 align:start position:0%
this is one that was um made by Endicott
 
02:26:48.150 --> 02:26:48.160 align:start position:0%
Fay uh and he said in his study that um
 
02:26:50.110 --> 02:26:50.120 align:start position:0%
as long as you're within 10t or more
 
02:26:53.950 --> 02:26:53.960 align:start position:0%
deeper of water um you know generally um
 
02:26:55.630 --> 02:26:55.640 align:start position:0%
his modeling says that you know you're
 
02:26:57.990 --> 02:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
in deep enough water and I I would say
 
02:27:00.510 --> 02:27:00.520 align:start position:0%
on that too is that it's important to
 
02:27:03.030 --> 02:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
recognize as other speakers have have
 
02:27:04.870 --> 02:27:04.880 align:start position:0%
said that there's no recreational
 
02:27:06.710 --> 02:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
benefit to being in shallow water
 
02:27:08.429 --> 02:27:08.439 align:start position:0%
there's no recreational benefit to carve
 
02:27:09.750 --> 02:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
the shoreline you know generally
 
02:27:11.070 --> 02:27:11.080 align:start position:0%
speaking wake Surfers are just looking
 
02:27:12.510 --> 02:27:12.520 align:start position:0%
for space to be able to do their
 
02:27:12.520 --> 02:27:13.990 align:start position:0%
for space to be able to do their
activity

02:27:13.990 --> 02:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
activity
 
02:27:16.469 --> 02:27:16.479 align:start position:0%
so to someone who I would see in shallow
 
02:27:18.670 --> 02:27:18.680 align:start position:0%
water I I would just as a fellow Boer I
 
02:27:20.030 --> 02:27:20.040 align:start position:0%
would just you know recommend to them
 
02:27:21.630 --> 02:27:21.640 align:start position:0%
hey you should you should go out farther
 
02:27:22.469 --> 02:27:22.479 align:start position:0%
in the lake it's just you're going to
 
02:27:24.230 --> 02:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
have a better experience and I I
 
02:27:26.389 --> 02:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
generally think most of them know
 
02:27:29.710 --> 02:27:29.720 align:start position:0%
that thank you thank you any more
 
02:27:33.190 --> 02:27:33.200 align:start position:0%
questions I don't see any do you have a
 
02:27:36.190 --> 02:27:36.200 align:start position:0%
copy of your testimony uh Mr chairman
 
02:27:38.070 --> 02:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
members I will get uh copies of this
 
02:27:41.630 --> 02:27:41.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:44.429 --> 02:27:44.439 align:start position:0%
it and thank you for your testimony
 
02:27:46.309 --> 02:27:46.319 align:start position:0%
thank you speaking in support of the
 
02:27:50.190 --> 02:27:50.200 align:start position:0%
bill Autumn O'Brien
 
02:27:54.070 --> 02:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
Autumn hi thank you I too live on
 
02:27:57.070 --> 02:27:57.080 align:start position:0%
Arlington Pond um and we actually
 
02:28:00.030 --> 02:28:00.040 align:start position:0%
established a water shed committee this
 
02:28:02.910 --> 02:28:02.920 align:start position:0%
year because last year during the season
 
02:28:06.110 --> 02:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
we had over 119 days that we were unable
 
02:28:08.790 --> 02:28:08.800 align:start position:0%
to swim in Arlington Pond due to Sino
 
02:28:11.230 --> 02:28:11.240 align:start position:0%
bacteria so as you can imagine there was
 
02:28:13.670 --> 02:28:13.680 align:start position:0%
only about a two- we period throughout
 
02:28:15.309 --> 02:28:15.319 align:start position:0%
the whole summer that did not have an
 
02:28:18.349 --> 02:28:18.359 align:start position:0%
advisory people do still choose to swim
 
02:28:20.469 --> 02:28:20.479 align:start position:0%
which is their choice unfortunately for
 
02:28:22.550 --> 02:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
pets it's an issue children it's an
 
02:28:25.070 --> 02:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
issue and so it is a real concern of
 
02:28:27.309 --> 02:28:27.319 align:start position:0%
ours and the reason that prompted this
 
02:28:29.830 --> 02:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
committee during the time of this
 
02:28:31.710 --> 02:28:31.720 align:start position:0%
committee since the end of last summer
 
02:28:34.750 --> 02:28:34.760 align:start position:0%
we have been reviewing all kinds of
 
02:28:36.910 --> 02:28:36.920 align:start position:0%
information to try and help us with the
 
02:28:39.190 --> 02:28:39.200 align:start position:0%
CYO bacteria issue and what is the best
 
02:28:41.710 --> 02:28:41.720 align:start position:0%
thing that we can do for our Lake one
 
02:28:43.870 --> 02:28:43.880 align:start position:0%
thing that has repeatedly come up and
 
02:28:46.790 --> 02:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
again there are a lot of studies out out
 
02:28:50.070 --> 02:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
there in regards to wakeboards and what
 
02:28:51.710 --> 02:28:51.720 align:start position:0%
that does to the environment with
 
02:28:53.990 --> 02:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
erosion on the shore and so forth and
 
02:28:56.429 --> 02:28:56.439 align:start position:0%
I'm sure I think I've heard some earlier
 
02:28:58.550 --> 02:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
say that there are also studies that
 
02:29:01.429 --> 02:29:01.439 align:start position:0%
there aren't any impact um as the
 
02:29:03.830 --> 02:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
gentleman mentioned earlier I can only
 
02:29:06.110 --> 02:29:06.120 align:start position:0%
speak to my experience as a resident of
 
02:29:10.030 --> 02:29:10.040 align:start position:0%
Arlington Pond um Colleen earlier told
 
02:29:14.070 --> 02:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
you that our pond is uh very it's small
 
02:29:18.349 --> 02:29:18.359 align:start position:0%
it's a 269 ACR body of water I believe
 
02:29:22.990 --> 02:29:23.000 align:start position:0%
but most of the areas are 300 feet on
 
02:29:25.670 --> 02:29:25.680 align:start position:0%
average in areas from sh to shore we
 
02:29:28.870 --> 02:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
also have several islands and Lon
 
02:29:33.309 --> 02:29:33.319 align:start position:0%
Sanctuary um the problem is that the
 
02:29:35.710 --> 02:29:35.720 align:start position:0%
area is not big enough for these boats
 
02:29:37.429 --> 02:29:37.439 align:start position:0%
as well as she mentioned earlier the
 
02:29:39.870 --> 02:29:39.880 align:start position:0%
average depth being 10 feet there are
 
02:29:42.710 --> 02:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
areas that are 39 ft but I too have a
 
02:29:44.790 --> 02:29:44.800 align:start position:0%
depth binder so we go around and look at
 
02:29:48.230 --> 02:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
the depth of the lake it has and is
 
02:29:51.070 --> 02:29:51.080 align:start position:0%
causing issues between neighbors um
 
02:29:53.269 --> 02:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
because we do have like probably every
 
02:29:55.830 --> 02:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
Community social media where people go
 
02:29:58.349 --> 02:29:58.359 align:start position:0%
on and say this one did this this one
 
02:30:01.550 --> 02:30:01.560 align:start position:0%
had loud noise this one went too fast
 
02:30:04.710 --> 02:30:04.720 align:start position:0%
Etc and there is a lot to be said for
 
02:30:06.670 --> 02:30:06.680 align:start position:0%
wanting each resident to be able to make
 
02:30:08.550 --> 02:30:08.560 align:start position:0%
an educated decision on the way that
 
02:30:11.870 --> 02:30:11.880 align:start position:0%
they operate a watercraft or a boat how
 
02:30:13.750 --> 02:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
they bring their guest out who they
 
02:30:16.670 --> 02:30:16.680 align:start position:0%
allow to use their boats unfortunately
 
02:30:20.030 --> 02:30:20.040 align:start position:0%
ly we do not have a lot of that and when
 
02:30:22.230 --> 02:30:22.240 align:start position:0%
one side is trying to educate the other
 
02:30:24.309 --> 02:30:24.319 align:start position:0%
side and they're very passionate about
 
02:30:27.510 --> 02:30:27.520 align:start position:0%
their opinions it does cause conflict so
 
02:30:30.190 --> 02:30:30.200 align:start position:0%
the reason that I am in support of this
 
02:30:32.670 --> 02:30:32.680 align:start position:0%
is as are other people in the room in
 
02:30:34.990 --> 02:30:35.000 align:start position:0%
support is because I don't feel that
 
02:30:37.389 --> 02:30:37.399 align:start position:0%
it's my job as a resident of the lake to
 
02:30:39.389 --> 02:30:39.399 align:start position:0%
determine who should and should not be
 
02:30:43.510 --> 02:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
able to use what they can on the lake um
 
02:30:45.790 --> 02:30:45.800 align:start position:0%
we can use our experience I know that
 
02:30:47.110 --> 02:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
people have had to to replace their
 
02:30:49.550 --> 02:30:49.560 align:start position:0%
walls I know that the island is much
 
02:30:52.349 --> 02:30:52.359 align:start position:0%
smaller the large island is eroded all
 
02:30:55.030 --> 02:30:55.040 align:start position:0%
the way around um in the past few years
 
02:30:56.830 --> 02:30:56.840 align:start position:0%
where as wake boards have become more
 
02:30:59.790 --> 02:30:59.800 align:start position:0%
popular so we can only attest to what we
 
02:31:02.550 --> 02:31:02.560 align:start position:0%
see ourselves in our own Community I
 
02:31:04.790 --> 02:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
would like to see it so that as a
 
02:31:06.910 --> 02:31:06.920 align:start position:0%
resident we are able to petition the
 
02:31:09.830 --> 02:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
state to look further into this issue
 
02:31:11.710 --> 02:31:11.720 align:start position:0%
which is I assume what started though
 
02:31:15.150 --> 02:31:15.160 align:start position:0%
I'm not educated on the ban of one and
 
02:31:17.510 --> 02:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
two Cedar watercraft on certain bodies
 
02:31:20.110 --> 02:31:20.120 align:start position:0%
of lake under so many 75 Acres or
 
02:31:22.750 --> 02:31:22.760 align:start position:0%
whatever it is Arlington Pond is one of
 
02:31:25.510 --> 02:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
those Lakes where we cannot purchase or
 
02:31:27.469 --> 02:31:27.479 align:start position:0%
use those type of watercrafts on our
 
02:31:29.870 --> 02:31:29.880 align:start position:0%
lake so at some point there were people
 
02:31:31.990 --> 02:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
on our Lake that were certainly opposed
 
02:31:34.070 --> 02:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
to getting rid of those and then there
 
02:31:36.630 --> 02:31:36.640 align:start position:0%
were people that were in favor of
 
02:31:38.590 --> 02:31:38.600 align:start position:0%
getting rid of those but ultimately by
 
02:31:41.910 --> 02:31:41.920 align:start position:0%
the state establishing guidelines future
 
02:31:44.670 --> 02:31:44.680 align:start position:0%
generations and the people today no one
 
02:31:47.070 --> 02:31:47.080 align:start position:0%
is arguing no one is inclin conflict no
 
02:31:50.269 --> 02:31:50.279 align:start position:0%
one has problems with the law that says
 
02:31:52.030 --> 02:31:52.040 align:start position:0%
we are not allowed to have these types
 
02:31:55.309 --> 02:31:55.319 align:start position:0%
of watercrafts on our body of water so
 
02:31:57.349 --> 02:31:57.359 align:start position:0%
if this bill then allows us as a
 
02:32:00.110 --> 02:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
community to reach out and establish
 
02:32:02.550 --> 02:32:02.560 align:start position:0%
future laws we may all be in Conflict
 
02:32:04.990 --> 02:32:05.000 align:start position:0%
now but two years from now five years
 
02:32:07.550 --> 02:32:07.560 align:start position:0%
from now if the state decides on this we
 
02:32:10.590 --> 02:32:10.600 align:start position:0%
won't have that conflict and myself just
 
02:32:13.070 --> 02:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
like many others that are opposed and in
 
02:32:15.750 --> 02:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
favor of this bill we want to protect
 
02:32:18.910 --> 02:32:18.920 align:start position:0%
our I of water I mean not living on a
 
02:32:20.830 --> 02:32:20.840 align:start position:0%
lake and paying what we pay for our
 
02:32:23.429 --> 02:32:23.439 align:start position:0%
lakefront homes and the taxes and the
 
02:32:25.590 --> 02:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
upkeep and everything we're doing to not
 
02:32:28.950 --> 02:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
be able to use or swim in our Lakes for
 
02:32:32.750 --> 02:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
90% of our season is problematic and
 
02:32:35.910 --> 02:32:35.920 align:start position:0%
without changes happening in every area
 
02:32:38.190 --> 02:32:38.200 align:start position:0%
of protecting the environment that is
 
02:32:39.950 --> 02:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
going to continue to happen more and
 
02:32:42.150 --> 02:32:42.160 align:start position:0%
more and more so that we really won't be
 
02:32:45.389 --> 02:32:45.399 align:start position:0%
concerned about what type of things are
 
02:32:47.230 --> 02:32:47.240 align:start position:0%
on our Lake because we won't be able to
 
02:32:49.750 --> 02:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
use them as we have in the past and so
 
02:32:51.790 --> 02:32:51.800 align:start position:0%
they'll become bodies of water like
 
02:32:53.510 --> 02:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
canaby Lake Park which is our drinking
 
02:32:56.230 --> 02:32:56.240 align:start position:0%
source that has no swimming in it so
 
02:33:00.550 --> 02:33:00.560 align:start position:0%
again I'm only speaking for my personal
 
02:33:03.349 --> 02:33:03.359 align:start position:0%
um experiences on our lington that is a
 
02:33:05.590 --> 02:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
smaller body of water that has a very
 
02:33:08.590 --> 02:33:08.600 align:start position:0%
low depth and I have would not be able
 
02:33:09.950 --> 02:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
to tell the difference on the wake
 
02:33:12.389 --> 02:33:12.399 align:start position:0%
boards on our Lake of whether it's 10
 
02:33:15.590 --> 02:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
feet or 100 feet because the weights are
 
02:33:18.150 --> 02:33:18.160 align:start position:0%
still the same they're still huge and
 
02:33:20.309 --> 02:33:20.319 align:start position:0%
they're still bashing into the waters
 
02:33:22.309 --> 02:33:22.319 align:start position:0%
the walls they're still hitting the
 
02:33:24.590 --> 02:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
small children on the shore and causing
 
02:33:27.670 --> 02:33:27.680 align:start position:0%
them to move um it's become a safety
 
02:33:31.150 --> 02:33:31.160 align:start position:0%
issue as well as a environmental issue
 
02:33:34.830 --> 02:33:34.840 align:start position:0%
on our Lake thank you any questions for
 
02:33:34.840 --> 02:33:38.030 align:start position:0%
on our Lake thank you any questions for
our

02:33:38.030 --> 02:33:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:41.750 --> 02:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
speaker Mr Wolf represent wolf have you
 
02:33:44.790 --> 02:33:44.800 align:start position:0%
uh talked to Marine Patrol about the
 
02:33:46.870 --> 02:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
distances as Marine Patrol ever come
 
02:33:49.910 --> 02:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
over to look at that we do have Marine
 
02:33:52.870 --> 02:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
Patrol they're not out as much as they
 
02:33:56.230 --> 02:33:56.240 align:start position:0%
were in previous years um they do pull
 
02:33:59.670 --> 02:33:59.680 align:start position:0%
people over for a lot of different
 
02:34:02.790 --> 02:34:02.800 align:start position:0%
things we've certainly had again because
 
02:34:05.550 --> 02:34:05.560 align:start position:0%
of social media almost everybody in the
 
02:34:07.710 --> 02:34:07.720 align:start position:0%
community is aware as soon as a Marine
 
02:34:10.429 --> 02:34:10.439 align:start position:0%
Patrol bro boat is brought into the lake
 
02:34:12.469 --> 02:34:12.479 align:start position:0%
uh because it spreads like wildfire so
 
02:34:15.309 --> 02:34:15.319 align:start position:0%
everyone behaves while they're there
 
02:34:17.910 --> 02:34:17.920 align:start position:0%
it's just the way that the world is so
 
02:34:20.230 --> 02:34:20.240 align:start position:0%
but of course people are I shouldn't say
 
02:34:22.670 --> 02:34:22.680 align:start position:0%
all people because on our Lake in
 
02:34:26.269 --> 02:34:26.279 align:start position:0%
particular we have 200 300 Lakefront
 
02:34:28.990 --> 02:34:29.000 align:start position:0%
residents and right now there's I think
 
02:34:31.870 --> 02:34:31.880 align:start position:0%
13 houses being built on our lake so we
 
02:34:34.429 --> 02:34:34.439 align:start position:0%
are having a lot of new people come into
 
02:34:37.830 --> 02:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
our Lake that take the class and for the
 
02:34:39.630 --> 02:34:39.640 align:start position:0%
six hours at the fire station and all of
 
02:34:41.429 --> 02:34:41.439 align:start position:0%
a sudden they're they're they have the
 
02:34:42.870 --> 02:34:42.880 align:start position:0%
nicest boat and they're coming out here
 
02:34:45.389 --> 02:34:45.399 align:start position:0%
and they're wake surfing we would love
 
02:34:47.429 --> 02:34:47.439 align:start position:0%
to be able to enforce that more but
 
02:34:49.950 --> 02:34:49.960 align:start position:0%
quite frankly we do not have P Marine
 
02:34:52.030 --> 02:34:52.040 align:start position:0%
Patrol there often enough to do that
 
02:34:54.389 --> 02:34:54.399 align:start position:0%
which causes yet another conflict
 
02:34:56.469 --> 02:34:56.479 align:start position:0%
between the
 
02:34:58.830 --> 02:34:58.840 align:start position:0%
residents any other questions for the
 
02:35:01.309 --> 02:35:01.319 align:start position:0%
speaker seeing none thank you for your
 
02:35:04.590 --> 02:35:04.600 align:start position:0%
testimony I have seven cards left of all
 
02:35:06.950 --> 02:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
people opposed to the bill your time
 
02:35:10.469 --> 02:35:10.479 align:start position:0%
goes from one minute to five minute um I
 
02:35:12.230 --> 02:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
want all of you to have an opportunity
 
02:35:14.710 --> 02:35:14.720 align:start position:0%
to speak but can you please not repeat
 
02:35:16.670 --> 02:35:16.680 align:start position:0%
what other people say
 
02:35:19.790 --> 02:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
I'd appreciate that and um if you can
 
02:35:22.190 --> 02:35:22.200 align:start position:0%
hold to your time would all appreciate
 
02:35:40.030 --> 02:35:40.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:42.750 --> 02:35:42.760 align:start position:0%
Carl how you doing
 
02:35:47.269 --> 02:35:47.279 align:start position:0%
everybody uh I also live on owton pond
 
02:35:50.550 --> 02:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
uh but I oppose the bill uh number of
 
02:35:52.630 --> 02:35:52.640 align:start position:0%
items I wanted to kind of point out uh
 
02:35:55.389 --> 02:35:55.399 align:start position:0%
the 25 residents are Property Owners
 
02:35:57.510 --> 02:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
everybody keeps talking residents but it
 
02:36:00.269 --> 02:36:00.279 align:start position:0%
also says Property Owners uh I do know
 
02:36:02.070 --> 02:36:02.080 align:start position:0%
there's a few people on the lake that
 
02:36:05.030 --> 02:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
have a lot of properties so one person
 
02:36:06.269 --> 02:36:06.279 align:start position:0%
could actually
 
02:36:09.429 --> 02:36:09.439 align:start position:0%
represent more than one vote of trying
 
02:36:12.110 --> 02:36:12.120 align:start position:0%
to get uh a commission to take a look at
 
02:36:16.469 --> 02:36:16.479 align:start position:0%
it so I think that's incorrect uh one
 
02:36:18.990 --> 02:36:19.000 align:start position:0%
vote one person should be one vote I
 
02:36:23.030 --> 02:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
also think 25 is a very low number um to
 
02:36:23.040 --> 02:36:26.190 align:start position:0%
also think 25 is a very low number um to
go

02:36:26.190 --> 02:36:26.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:28.830 --> 02:36:28.840 align:start position:0%
after and then in the line of I I know
 
02:36:30.630 --> 02:36:30.640 align:start position:0%
it was disgusted and I'll just say it
 
02:36:33.750 --> 02:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
quick you only are going to notify
 
02:36:36.790 --> 02:36:36.800 align:start position:0%
people on the lake or deed people uh for
 
02:36:39.230 --> 02:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
years I lived down in Connecticut I did
 
02:36:41.309 --> 02:36:41.319 align:start position:0%
was didn't live on a lake I drove my
 
02:36:45.309 --> 02:36:45.319 align:start position:0%
boat to I tow my boat to uh a water body
 
02:36:48.030 --> 02:36:48.040 align:start position:0%
to actually do the enjoyment on it uh
 
02:36:49.110 --> 02:36:49.120 align:start position:0%
those people aren't actually going to
 
02:36:50.990 --> 02:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
get notified of the
 
02:36:54.550 --> 02:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
hearing so kind of question that piece
 
02:36:58.870 --> 02:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
of it uh the another one is really the
 
02:37:01.630 --> 02:37:01.640 align:start position:0%
bill is only going to get addressed at
 
02:37:05.550 --> 02:37:05.560 align:start position:0%
small lakes uh sunap or Winn pasak if
 
02:37:08.750 --> 02:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
someone were to push it 25 people were
 
02:37:10.670 --> 02:37:10.680 align:start position:0%
to push it they would have to
 
02:37:13.389 --> 02:37:13.399 align:start position:0%
notify everybody every person on that
 
02:37:16.070 --> 02:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
lake with a certified letter that's a c
 
02:37:18.110 --> 02:37:18.120 align:start position:0%
ly timec consuming effort it's likely
 
02:37:20.030 --> 02:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
not to happen yet at the same time if
 
02:37:22.070 --> 02:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
you look at a sunup or Winn pasak
 
02:37:24.670 --> 02:37:24.680 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of little CES on that Lake
 
02:37:26.389 --> 02:37:26.399 align:start position:0%
little Coes that could be the same size
 
02:37:28.910 --> 02:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
as Arlington Pond those Coes are going
 
02:37:30.870 --> 02:37:30.880 align:start position:0%
to see the same they're going to see
 
02:37:34.110 --> 02:37:34.120 align:start position:0%
boats in there so but the likelihood
 
02:37:35.790 --> 02:37:35.800 align:start position:0%
that this thing is going to get a
 
02:37:37.710 --> 02:37:37.720 align:start position:0%
Committee hearing on a wiip basaki or
 
02:37:40.429 --> 02:37:40.439 align:start position:0%
sunap is really low I would suspect just
 
02:37:42.630 --> 02:37:42.640 align:start position:0%
because of the effort to try to notify
 
02:37:44.309 --> 02:37:44.319 align:start position:0%
every person on that
 
02:37:48.469 --> 02:37:48.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:51.030 --> 02:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
and then the bill talks about
 
02:37:52.990 --> 02:37:53.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner it doesn't talk about a
 
02:37:54.630 --> 02:37:54.640 align:start position:0%
committee it talks about a commissioner
 
02:37:57.309 --> 02:37:57.319 align:start position:0%
making a decision so when as I read the
 
02:37:59.550 --> 02:37:59.560 align:start position:0%
bill it's one person making that
 
02:38:02.750 --> 02:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
decision and one person is difficult you
 
02:38:04.870 --> 02:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
know you can now get political
 
02:38:07.030 --> 02:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
situations involved or personal
 
02:38:09.389 --> 02:38:09.399 align:start position:0%
situations to make a decision that if
 
02:38:11.309 --> 02:38:11.319 align:start position:0%
that commissioner happens to live on the
 
02:38:13.910 --> 02:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
lake and doesn't doesn't have a doesn't
 
02:38:17.269 --> 02:38:17.279 align:start position:0%
wake surf he might say oh no problem
 
02:38:20.389 --> 02:38:20.399 align:start position:0%
what is you know there's with that I
 
02:38:22.630 --> 02:38:22.640 align:start position:0%
look at the rules as to what the
 
02:38:24.230 --> 02:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner should look at you know
 
02:38:28.469 --> 02:38:28.479 align:start position:0%
it's it's water size it's its depth but
 
02:38:30.429 --> 02:38:30.439 align:start position:0%
it doesn't give any definition of what
 
02:38:35.110 --> 02:38:35.120 align:start position:0%
that is is it you know 10 feet is it
 
02:38:38.349 --> 02:38:38.359 align:start position:0%
something that is 500 feet apart it it
 
02:38:41.429 --> 02:38:41.439 align:start position:0%
it leaves it very much open to one
 
02:38:43.309 --> 02:38:43.319 align:start position:0%
person's opinion versus another person's
 
02:38:45.389 --> 02:38:45.399 align:start position:0%
opinion to make the decision if you're
 
02:38:48.510 --> 02:38:48.520 align:start position:0%
going to have have a rule it should have
 
02:38:52.870 --> 02:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
specific items specific you know noise
 
02:38:56.910 --> 02:38:56.920 align:start position:0%
level in DBS wave wave height in
 
02:38:59.469 --> 02:38:59.479 align:start position:0%
feet uh instead of just general because
 
02:39:02.389 --> 02:39:02.399 align:start position:0%
it just makes it
 
02:39:06.349 --> 02:39:06.359 align:start position:0%
difficult and then in the line of if I
 
02:39:08.990 --> 02:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
say I get 25 people or I get a commiss I
 
02:39:12.190 --> 02:39:12.200 align:start position:0%
get a hearing and it rules against
 
02:39:15.269 --> 02:39:15.279 align:start position:0%
me do I get to go just put in another
 
02:39:15.279 --> 02:39:16.750 align:start position:0%
me do I get to go just put in another
request

02:39:16.750 --> 02:39:16.760 align:start position:0%
request
 
02:39:19.150 --> 02:39:19.160 align:start position:0%
a day later and ask for another hearing
 
02:39:20.670 --> 02:39:20.680 align:start position:0%
and ask for another hearing and ask for
 
02:39:22.309 --> 02:39:22.319 align:start position:0%
another hearing wait until the
 
02:39:24.710 --> 02:39:24.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner changes ask for another
 
02:39:27.429 --> 02:39:27.439 align:start position:0%
hearing until I get the answer I want to
 
02:39:30.110 --> 02:39:30.120 align:start position:0%
get there's not there's nothing to stop
 
02:39:33.349 --> 02:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
someone from constantly reasing the
 
02:39:36.590 --> 02:39:36.600 align:start position:0%
commission to review the same Lake now
 
02:39:40.590 --> 02:39:40.600 align:start position:0%
if you if you're GNA allow that then can
 
02:39:43.710 --> 02:39:43.720 align:start position:0%
you know someone with a that wakes surf
 
02:39:46.070 --> 02:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
ask the commission multiple times over
 
02:39:49.110 --> 02:39:49.120 align:start position:0%
and over and over and over to revise the
 
02:39:50.349 --> 02:39:50.359 align:start position:0%
revise the
 
02:39:53.590 --> 02:39:53.600 align:start position:0%
Restriction so something to think
 
02:39:56.630 --> 02:39:56.640 align:start position:0%
about and then as I said I live in
 
02:39:58.990 --> 02:39:59.000 align:start position:0%
Arlington Pond we moved up my wife and I
 
02:40:02.110 --> 02:40:02.120 align:start position:0%
moved up she's also in support of uh not
 
02:40:04.630 --> 02:40:04.640 align:start position:0%
in support of this bill uh we moved up
 
02:40:07.030 --> 02:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
like four years ago we researched the
 
02:40:09.349 --> 02:40:09.359 align:start position:0%
lakes in New Hampshire to find a lake
 
02:40:12.070 --> 02:40:12.080 align:start position:0%
that allowed no water sports we wanted
 
02:40:13.830 --> 02:40:13.840 align:start position:0%
and the size of the lake we wanted there
 
02:40:16.230 --> 02:40:16.240 align:start position:0%
is lakes in New Hampshire like canopy
 
02:40:18.870 --> 02:40:18.880 align:start position:0%
that doesn't allow water sports uh you
 
02:40:21.230 --> 02:40:21.240 align:start position:0%
can't swim in the lake so it's really
 
02:40:24.790 --> 02:40:24.800 align:start position:0%
difficult to wake surf uh we moved up
 
02:40:27.510 --> 02:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
here we bought a house hundreds of
 
02:40:29.230 --> 02:40:29.240 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars and we do have a
 
02:40:31.750 --> 02:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
wakeboarding boat and it would be
 
02:40:34.269 --> 02:40:34.279 align:start position:0%
extremely upsetting if suddenly we
 
02:40:36.070 --> 02:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
couldn't use that in the way we want to
 
02:40:39.349 --> 02:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
use that and I'll say it's my wife and I
 
02:40:42.710 --> 02:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
were're both retired wake surfing is a
 
02:40:45.349 --> 02:40:45.359 align:start position:0%
sport I'm going to say good for old
 
02:40:48.790 --> 02:40:48.800 align:start position:0%
people people uh it is it is the boat
 
02:40:51.190 --> 02:40:51.200 align:start position:0%
goes 10 miles an hour the water is soft
 
02:40:53.150 --> 02:40:53.160 align:start position:0%
at 10 miles an hour as our bodies are
 
02:40:54.550 --> 02:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
getting older and I'm sitting here in a
 
02:41:00.110 --> 02:41:00.120 align:start position:0%
brace uh what I can do you know an older
 
02:41:03.110 --> 02:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
person can do wake surfing is very
 
02:41:06.349 --> 02:41:06.359 align:start position:0%
non-challenging on the body where wake
 
02:41:09.550 --> 02:41:09.560 align:start position:0%
boarding water skin tubing is very
 
02:41:11.750 --> 02:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
difficult if you're to ban wake surfing
 
02:41:14.510 --> 02:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
on the lake my use at a lake other than
 
02:41:16.590 --> 02:41:16.600 align:start position:0%
puts and around and looking at pretty
 
02:41:20.070 --> 02:41:20.080 align:start position:0%
houses is gone that's that's the main
 
02:41:22.269 --> 02:41:22.279 align:start position:0%
thing I do on the lake is wake
 
02:41:26.550 --> 02:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
surfing uh and add in a line of the wave
 
02:41:28.950 --> 02:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
size I have an older boat one of the
 
02:41:30.790 --> 02:41:30.800 align:start position:0%
earlier gentlemen said wake surfing
 
02:41:33.510 --> 02:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
started back in the 50s or 60s when
 
02:41:35.790 --> 02:41:35.800 align:start position:0%
there was small boat smaller boats I
 
02:41:39.349 --> 02:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
have a 2004 wake surfing boat if I fill
 
02:41:43.429 --> 02:41:43.439 align:start position:0%
my ballast all up my wake is way smaller
 
02:41:45.710 --> 02:41:45.720 align:start position:0%
than a new wake boarding boat that's
 
02:41:48.230 --> 02:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
bigger a bigger boat puts out with no
 
02:41:52.389 --> 02:41:52.399 align:start position:0%
ballast on so they just drive around and
 
02:41:54.070 --> 02:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
they can create a bigger weight than my
 
02:41:57.230 --> 02:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
wake boarding boat does when I have all
 
02:41:59.389 --> 02:41:59.399 align:start position:0%
the ballasts in and I can wake surf
 
02:42:03.349 --> 02:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
totally fine behind it um so Banning an
 
02:42:03.359 --> 02:42:04.429 align:start position:0%
totally fine behind it um so Banning an
entire

02:42:04.429 --> 02:42:04.439 align:start position:0%
entire
 
02:42:08.110 --> 02:42:08.120 align:start position:0%
sport again is is really discriminating
 
02:42:09.550 --> 02:42:09.560 align:start position:0%
against someone with an older boat or
 
02:42:10.910 --> 02:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
someone even with a newer boat that
 
02:42:13.349 --> 02:42:13.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't put all the ballast in uh you
 
02:42:14.750 --> 02:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
know you get someone with a little kid
 
02:42:17.150 --> 02:42:17.160 align:start position:0%
out there they they need very little
 
02:42:20.389 --> 02:42:20.399 align:start position:0%
wake for that little child to wake surf
 
02:42:21.590 --> 02:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden you're going to ban that
 
02:42:23.550 --> 02:42:23.560 align:start position:0%
child from wake surfing behind a you
 
02:42:26.670 --> 02:42:26.680 align:start position:0%
know a wave that's one or two feet tall
 
02:42:28.510 --> 02:42:28.520 align:start position:0%
um so that's where I said if you were to
 
02:42:32.429 --> 02:42:32.439 align:start position:0%
do something you should Define what is a
 
02:42:34.590 --> 02:42:34.600 align:start position:0%
biger too big a
 
02:42:34.600 --> 02:42:36.590 align:start position:0%
biger too big a
wave

02:42:36.590 --> 02:42:36.600 align:start position:0%
wave
 
02:42:39.070 --> 02:42:39.080 align:start position:0%
um and then I you know in the line of
 
02:42:40.950 --> 02:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
buying the house if you were to do
 
02:42:43.429 --> 02:42:43.439 align:start position:0%
something you should kind of grandfa
 
02:42:45.590 --> 02:42:45.600 align:start position:0%
Grandfather homeowners in or boat owner
 
02:42:48.950 --> 02:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
in uh you know like like I said we moved
 
02:42:51.070 --> 02:42:51.080 align:start position:0%
out of state up here we love New
 
02:42:53.110 --> 02:42:53.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh we spent hundreds of
 
02:42:55.150 --> 02:42:55.160 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars on a house we have a
 
02:42:58.269 --> 02:42:58.279 align:start position:0%
boat uh some of these boats mine not but
 
02:43:00.910 --> 02:43:00.920 align:start position:0%
some of these boats go as high as 150
 
02:43:03.230 --> 02:43:03.240 align:start position:0%
plus, for these boats all of a sudden
 
02:43:05.070 --> 02:43:05.080 align:start position:0%
one day I'm not going to be able to use
 
02:43:07.190 --> 02:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
that boat for the entertainment I want
 
02:43:08.309 --> 02:43:08.319 align:start position:0%
to use it
 
02:43:11.670 --> 02:43:11.680 align:start position:0%
for and I will also say we're talking
 
02:43:13.950 --> 02:43:13.960 align:start position:0%
wake surfing you know there's a lot of
 
02:43:16.469 --> 02:43:16.479 align:start position:0%
people commenting on wake board
 
02:43:19.950 --> 02:43:19.960 align:start position:0%
boats but the boat can create the wave I
 
02:43:21.469 --> 02:43:21.479 align:start position:0%
can put a bigger boat on the lake and I
 
02:43:23.389 --> 02:43:23.399 align:start position:0%
can create as big a wave or bigger wave
 
02:43:25.030 --> 02:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
than even you know the wake surfing
 
02:43:27.230 --> 02:43:27.240 align:start position:0%
boats there's nothing to restrict how
 
02:43:29.349 --> 02:43:29.359 align:start position:0%
big a boat do I put a 30 foot boat on
 
02:43:32.870 --> 02:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:36.670 --> 02:43:36.680 align:start position:0%
lake let's see uh I think
 
02:43:39.990 --> 02:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
that's probably everything I all my
 
02:43:42.429 --> 02:43:42.439 align:start position:0%
points thank you anybody have a question
 
02:43:43.990 --> 02:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
for this
 
02:43:46.309 --> 02:43:46.319 align:start position:0%

Lori

02:44:19.830 --> 02:44:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:21.469 --> 02:44:21.479 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Lori ball I'm
 
02:44:23.230 --> 02:44:23.240 align:start position:0%
the representative state representative
 
02:44:26.510 --> 02:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
from Salem I also live on Arlington Pond
 
02:44:29.269 --> 02:44:29.279 align:start position:0%
which I understand was the Catalyst um
 
02:44:31.190 --> 02:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
to this
 
02:44:33.990 --> 02:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
bill uh thank you for allowing me to
 
02:44:37.630 --> 02:44:37.640 align:start position:0%
speak I oppose this bill it reminds me
 
02:44:39.790 --> 02:44:39.800 align:start position:0%
of the culture differences when we first
 
02:44:42.070 --> 02:44:42.080 align:start position:0%
started with snowboarders and people
 
02:44:43.670 --> 02:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
didn't want snowboarders on the mountain
 
02:44:44.790 --> 02:44:44.800 align:start position:0%
because they were going to ruin the
 
02:44:48.389 --> 02:44:48.399 align:start position:0%
mountain so it was snowboarders versus
 
02:44:52.030 --> 02:44:52.040 align:start position:0%
skers while I commend the um the bill
 
02:44:53.349 --> 02:44:53.359 align:start position:0%
and its efforts to protect the
 
02:44:55.830 --> 02:44:55.840 align:start position:0%
environment I have a lot of concerns
 
02:44:57.670 --> 02:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
with how the bill is
 
02:45:00.070 --> 02:45:00.080 align:start position:0%
written I do agree that it pits one
 
02:45:01.550 --> 02:45:01.560 align:start position:0%
neighbor against the
 
02:45:01.560 --> 02:45:04.590 align:start position:0%
neighbor against the
other

02:45:04.590 --> 02:45:04.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:08.389 --> 02:45:08.399 align:start position:0%
um we have been on the lake for 18
 
02:45:11.230 --> 02:45:11.240 align:start position:0%
years we've been wake surfing on the
 
02:45:12.630 --> 02:45:12.640 align:start position:0%
lake for 18
 
02:45:15.870 --> 02:45:15.880 align:start position:0%
years and in those 18 years I only seen
 
02:45:18.269 --> 02:45:18.279 align:start position:0%
a problem in the last couple years last
 
02:45:21.030 --> 02:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
few years with one or two residents who
 
02:45:22.870 --> 02:45:22.880 align:start position:0%
have much larger boats that put out a
 
02:45:25.150 --> 02:45:25.160 align:start position:0%
much larger wake our boat does not do
 
02:45:27.309 --> 02:45:27.319 align:start position:0%
that I will mention that when we
 
02:45:30.429 --> 02:45:30.439 align:start position:0%
purchased our home uh 18 years ago and
 
02:45:33.550 --> 02:45:33.560 align:start position:0%
we have 450 ft of Waterfront including a
 
02:45:37.309 --> 02:45:37.319 align:start position:0%
Sandy Beach we had no erosion on the
 
02:45:39.670 --> 02:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
actually I take that back when I
 
02:45:41.790 --> 02:45:41.800 align:start position:0%
purchased it inside the bulkhead there
 
02:45:43.469 --> 02:45:43.479 align:start position:0%
was a lot of erosion there were no
 
02:45:45.230 --> 02:45:45.240 align:start position:0%
wakeboard boats on the on the lake at
 
02:45:47.110 --> 02:45:47.120 align:start position:0%
that time only pontoon
 
02:45:50.710 --> 02:45:50.720 align:start position:0%
boats we remedied that by digging out
 
02:45:52.550 --> 02:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
behind the bulkhead and putting in rip
 
02:45:54.309 --> 02:45:54.319 align:start position:0%
wrap so the water could come through and
 
02:45:56.630 --> 02:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
filter back out we've not had any
 
02:45:59.110 --> 02:45:59.120 align:start position:0%
erosion we live across from the island
 
02:46:00.550 --> 02:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
that they're talking about we are on the
 
02:46:02.110 --> 02:46:02.120 align:start position:0%
largest section of the lake we get the
 
02:46:04.710 --> 02:46:04.720 align:start position:0%
most pounding including our beach no
 
02:46:06.950 --> 02:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
erosion I get more erosion in the winter
 
02:46:08.910 --> 02:46:08.920 align:start position:0%
from the wind that blows all the sand
 
02:46:10.510 --> 02:46:10.520 align:start position:0%
across my
 
02:46:13.190 --> 02:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
yard um another thing is Arlington Pond
 
02:46:17.070 --> 02:46:17.080 align:start position:0%
was mentioned that we are a dam so our
 
02:46:19.950 --> 02:46:19.960 align:start position:0%
water is lowered every year exposing all
 
02:46:22.550 --> 02:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
the edges to wind throughout the winter
 
02:46:25.710 --> 02:46:25.720 align:start position:0%
months so that causes erosion as
 
02:46:28.830 --> 02:46:28.840 align:start position:0%
well which is why we end up with these
 
02:46:30.590 --> 02:46:30.600 align:start position:0%
um conflicts between neighbors because
 
02:46:33.590 --> 02:46:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:36.309 --> 02:46:36.319 align:start position:0%
differently I have a concern with this
 
02:46:39.150 --> 02:46:39.160 align:start position:0%
bill because it allows Property Owners
 
02:46:41.910 --> 02:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
within the town not the property owners
 
02:46:44.070 --> 02:46:44.080 align:start position:0%
who AB but the lake but everyone in the
 
02:46:46.550 --> 02:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
town can put forward this
 
02:46:49.429 --> 02:46:49.439 align:start position:0%
petition and it can be put forward by
 
02:46:51.269 --> 02:46:51.279 align:start position:0%
residents though that means anybody who
 
02:46:53.349 --> 02:46:53.359 align:start position:0%
rents so again like the last gentleman
 
02:46:55.750 --> 02:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
said if you have one person that owns a
 
02:46:57.550 --> 02:46:57.560 align:start position:0%
large number of properties they can
 
02:47:00.230 --> 02:47:00.240 align:start position:0%
easily put together 25 people they don't
 
02:47:01.790 --> 02:47:01.800 align:start position:0%
even have to live on the lake it could
 
02:47:03.309 --> 02:47:03.319 align:start position:0%
be a person who owns an apartment
 
02:47:05.389 --> 02:47:05.399 align:start position:0%
building five miles away from the lake
 
02:47:09.389 --> 02:47:09.399 align:start position:0%
and they can put in a petition to ctail
 
02:47:11.309 --> 02:47:11.319 align:start position:0%
the activities on the lake even though
 
02:47:12.910 --> 02:47:12.920 align:start position:0%
it has nothing to do with them they
 
02:47:15.550 --> 02:47:15.560 align:start position:0%
could be doing it at a spite because
 
02:47:18.030 --> 02:47:18.040 align:start position:0%
Arlington Pond does not have Public
 
02:47:21.750 --> 02:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
Access so there's a reason for them to a
 
02:47:24.670 --> 02:47:24.680 align:start position:0%
motivation for them to do that the idea
 
02:47:28.349 --> 02:47:28.359 align:start position:0%
that 25 people plus one can stop an
 
02:47:30.309 --> 02:47:30.319 align:start position:0%
activity on the lake is really
 
02:47:32.070 --> 02:47:32.080 align:start position:0%
disheartening to
 
02:47:36.110 --> 02:47:36.120 align:start position:0%
me uh the door more importantly it
 
02:47:38.710 --> 02:47:38.720 align:start position:0%
opens uh the bill more importantly opens
 
02:47:41.670 --> 02:47:41.680 align:start position:0%
the door for more bills being filed
 
02:47:43.830 --> 02:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
against other activities on the lake as
 
02:47:45.870 --> 02:47:45.880 align:start position:0%
I mentioned Arlington Pond gets lowered
 
02:47:49.230 --> 02:47:49.240 align:start position:0%
in the winter time so that means 25
 
02:47:52.150 --> 02:47:52.160 align:start position:0%
people can come up here and say we say
 
02:47:54.030 --> 02:47:54.040 align:start position:0%
we want to put in another bill but this
 
02:47:56.870 --> 02:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
time we want to curtail uh snowmobiling
 
02:47:58.389 --> 02:47:58.399 align:start position:0%
because after all the snowmobiles have
 
02:48:00.590 --> 02:48:00.600 align:start position:0%
to go up and down the sides of the lake
 
02:48:03.550 --> 02:48:03.560 align:start position:0%
and that's going to cause um the
 
02:48:05.269 --> 02:48:05.279 align:start position:0%
embankments to become
 
02:48:07.550 --> 02:48:07.560 align:start position:0%
eroded after that you'll have someone
 
02:48:10.269 --> 02:48:10.279 align:start position:0%
come in and say we want to stop fishing
 
02:48:11.630 --> 02:48:11.640 align:start position:0%
because do you know how many birds we
 
02:48:13.389 --> 02:48:13.399 align:start position:0%
find stuck in the fishing lines all
 
02:48:16.070 --> 02:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
along the trees along the
 
02:48:18.190 --> 02:48:18.200 align:start position:0%
islands because the fishing line is
 
02:48:20.269 --> 02:48:20.279 align:start position:0%
thrown it gets caught in the trees then
 
02:48:23.630 --> 02:48:23.640 align:start position:0%
we find the um the blue herring was
 
02:48:25.790 --> 02:48:25.800 align:start position:0%
caught in one and died so we'll have
 
02:48:27.030 --> 02:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
other people coming in and saying
 
02:48:29.110 --> 02:48:29.120 align:start position:0%
there's another environmental reason to
 
02:48:31.790 --> 02:48:31.800 align:start position:0%
now curtail the activities on the lake I
 
02:48:34.070 --> 02:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
just believe that this bill opens the
 
02:48:36.550 --> 02:48:36.560 align:start position:0%
CLE worms that we don't want to
 
02:48:41.269 --> 02:48:41.279 align:start position:0%
open the bill is also at odds because
 
02:48:45.510 --> 02:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
it the the petition can go can come in
 
02:48:47.590 --> 02:48:47.600 align:start position:0%
from anyone on the lake but then only
 
02:48:49.710 --> 02:48:49.720 align:start position:0%
those within the quarter mile of the
 
02:48:51.910 --> 02:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
lake are even aware that the petition is
 
02:48:53.630 --> 02:48:53.640 align:start position:0%
happening but what if you did have
 
02:48:55.070 --> 02:48:55.080 align:start position:0%
people who live on the other side of the
 
02:48:56.389 --> 02:48:56.399 align:start position:0%
ra of the
 
02:48:59.830 --> 02:48:59.840 align:start position:0%
town and they use a lake as well then
 
02:49:01.830 --> 02:49:01.840 align:start position:0%
they would not be know that this is
 
02:49:03.950 --> 02:49:03.960 align:start position:0%
going on because they would not be
 
02:49:06.469 --> 02:49:06.479 align:start position:0%
notified I find the bill vague because
 
02:49:08.110 --> 02:49:08.120 align:start position:0%
it doesn't lay out the parameters that
 
02:49:11.269 --> 02:49:11.279 align:start position:0%
the commissioner is going to um consider
 
02:49:13.469 --> 02:49:13.479 align:start position:0%
what are the guidelines and it doesn't
 
02:49:14.830 --> 02:49:14.840 align:start position:0%
it doesn't give you any of that but
 
02:49:16.550 --> 02:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
pleasa doesn't refer you to where to go
 
02:49:19.070 --> 02:49:19.080 align:start position:0%
find that information so you're kind of
 
02:49:21.030 --> 02:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
shooting arrows in the dark and people
 
02:49:22.469 --> 02:49:22.479 align:start position:0%
are throwing in petitions they don't
 
02:49:24.670 --> 02:49:24.680 align:start position:0%
know even if things are um the way
 
02:49:26.269 --> 02:49:26.279 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to be or or not the way
 
02:49:29.790 --> 02:49:29.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:32.630 --> 02:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
be it also concerns me that I'm just
 
02:49:34.389 --> 02:49:34.399 align:start position:0%
wondering when it comes to all of these
 
02:49:36.429 --> 02:49:36.439 align:start position:0%
petitions and all of these hearings
 
02:49:38.190 --> 02:49:38.200 align:start position:0%
what's becoming secondary if this
 
02:49:39.710 --> 02:49:39.720 align:start position:0%
becomes the primary that the
 
02:49:41.110 --> 02:49:41.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner is going to be looking at
 
02:49:43.269 --> 02:49:43.279 align:start position:0%
what's being put on the side what's not
 
02:49:49.910 --> 02:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:52.070 --> 02:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
the biggest thing that I find with this
 
02:49:56.110 --> 02:49:56.120 align:start position:0%
bill honestly is we're focusing on an
 
02:49:57.790 --> 02:49:57.800 align:start position:0%
activity wake
 
02:50:00.830 --> 02:50:00.840 align:start position:0%
surfing when the reality is what I'm
 
02:50:02.790 --> 02:50:02.800 align:start position:0%
hearing is people are trying to say it's
 
02:50:04.750 --> 02:50:04.760 align:start position:0%
the waves that are causing the
 
02:50:07.630 --> 02:50:07.640 align:start position:0%
problems so stopping the wake surfing
 
02:50:09.750 --> 02:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't eliminate the waves we're still
 
02:50:11.429 --> 02:50:11.439 align:start position:0%
going to have the people on the lake
 
02:50:13.630 --> 02:50:13.640 align:start position:0%
with the big boats creating the big
 
02:50:13.640 --> 02:50:16.790 align:start position:0%
with the big boats creating the big
waves

02:50:16.790 --> 02:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:19.309 --> 02:50:19.319 align:start position:0%
and given that um with today's
 
02:50:20.870 --> 02:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
technology and the fact that these
 
02:50:23.070 --> 02:50:23.080 align:start position:0%
people are paying well over $100,000 for
 
02:50:24.950 --> 02:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
their boats I think someone is going to
 
02:50:26.469 --> 02:50:26.479 align:start position:0%
come up with a really good idea on how
 
02:50:29.670 --> 02:50:29.680 align:start position:0%
to use that wave in another way that
 
02:50:31.870 --> 02:50:31.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't fall under wake surfing so I
 
02:50:32.990 --> 02:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
think then you're going to be back here
 
02:50:34.870 --> 02:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
again to try and figure out okay well
 
02:50:36.510 --> 02:50:36.520 align:start position:0%
now what do we do they're not wake
 
02:50:37.910 --> 02:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
surfing but we still have these three
 
02:50:40.630 --> 02:50:40.640 align:start position:0%
and four foot waves coming in so this
 
02:50:42.750 --> 02:50:42.760 align:start position:0%
bill really doesn't address what's at
 
02:50:45.309 --> 02:50:45.319 align:start position:0%
the heart of the issue
 
02:50:46.710 --> 02:50:46.720 align:start position:0%
with that being said I'd like to say
 
02:50:48.990 --> 02:50:49.000 align:start position:0%
that I would I would not I would oppose
 
02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:49.990 align:start position:0%
that I would I would not I would oppose
this

02:50:49.990 --> 02:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:50:53.429 --> 02:50:53.439 align:start position:0%
bill I I commend its intent but I don't
 
02:50:55.630 --> 02:50:55.640 align:start position:0%
think it's ready for prime time I think
 
02:50:57.510 --> 02:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
an alternative would be as I've heard
 
02:51:00.190 --> 02:51:00.200 align:start position:0%
from many people we need more Marine
 
02:51:02.990 --> 02:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
Patrol we only have a small few number
 
02:51:05.150 --> 02:51:05.160 align:start position:0%
of people that are not abiding by the
 
02:51:07.710 --> 02:51:07.720 align:start position:0%
rules that are causing problems on lakes
 
02:51:09.830 --> 02:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
we should not be punishing everyone
 
02:51:09.840 --> 02:51:10.950 align:start position:0%
we should not be punishing everyone
thank

02:51:10.950 --> 02:51:10.960 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:51:12.950 --> 02:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
you you have any questions
 
02:51:15.630 --> 02:51:15.640 align:start position:0%
representative rung thank you Mr chair
 
02:51:16.990 --> 02:51:17.000 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative ball for
 
02:51:19.870 --> 02:51:19.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question um in some of your
 
02:51:23.630 --> 02:51:23.640 align:start position:0%
comments I I'm wondering if you um are
 
02:51:26.269 --> 02:51:26.279 align:start position:0%
familiar that this type of a bill has
 
02:51:28.910 --> 02:51:28.920 align:start position:0%
been in statute for probably over 40
 
02:51:32.910 --> 02:51:32.920 align:start position:0%
years um where and then and in Statue
 
02:51:35.550 --> 02:51:35.560 align:start position:0%
currently it it allows just 10 residents
 
02:51:38.590 --> 02:51:38.600 align:start position:0%
to petition and it has to do with um
 
02:51:42.190 --> 02:51:42.200 align:start position:0%
individual uh motor watercraft so this
 
02:51:45.309 --> 02:51:45.319 align:start position:0%
isn't a new thing um and and also those
 
02:51:47.550 --> 02:51:47.560 align:start position:0%
petitioners don't make the decision all
 
02:51:49.469 --> 02:51:49.479 align:start position:0%
they're doing is petitioning the
 
02:51:52.349 --> 02:51:52.359 align:start position:0%
department of safety to hold a hearing
 
02:51:54.349 --> 02:51:54.359 align:start position:0%
and you had also commented and and I'm
 
02:51:57.150 --> 02:51:57.160 align:start position:0%
not sure if if you're aware but you
 
02:52:00.110 --> 02:52:00.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned that it needs parameters um
 
02:52:04.309 --> 02:52:04.319 align:start position:0%
those are listed in um page two lines
 
02:52:08.870 --> 02:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
24 through 30 uh through uh line one of
 
02:52:11.269 --> 02:52:11.279 align:start position:0%
the following page it encompasses
 
02:52:13.309 --> 02:52:13.319 align:start position:0%
everything the impact to the environment
 
02:52:17.229 --> 02:52:17.239 align:start position:0%
and Wildlife the surface area the
 
02:52:19.429 --> 02:52:19.439 align:start position:0%
uses that have been established for the
 
02:52:21.550 --> 02:52:21.560 align:start position:0%
lake but another component that's part
 
02:52:23.510 --> 02:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
of the hearing is the necessity of
 
02:52:26.309 --> 02:52:26.319 align:start position:0%
ensuring access to and use of the lake
 
02:52:28.670 --> 02:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
Pond and River for all individuals and
 
02:52:30.389 --> 02:52:30.399 align:start position:0%
the right of those individuals to
 
02:52:34.870 --> 02:52:34.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate use of the public Waters so
 
02:52:38.150 --> 02:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
um my question is all that in
 
02:52:40.630 --> 02:52:40.640 align:start position:0%
consideration do you believe that the
 
02:52:43.110 --> 02:52:43.120 align:start position:0%
department of safety can make a
 
02:52:48.309 --> 02:52:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:51.110 --> 02:52:51.120 align:start position:0%
hearing I don't want to say anything bad
 
02:52:54.030 --> 02:52:54.040 align:start position:0%
against the department of safety but the
 
02:52:56.190 --> 02:52:56.200 align:start position:0%
squeaky wheel gets the oil so if the
 
02:52:57.990 --> 02:52:58.000 align:start position:0%
same person keeps repeating and they
 
02:52:59.870 --> 02:52:59.880 align:start position:0%
keep bringing it back and back and back
 
02:53:01.630 --> 02:53:01.640 align:start position:0%
eventually things are going to go their
 
02:53:04.070 --> 02:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
way the parameters that I'm talking
 
02:53:05.830 --> 02:53:05.840 align:start position:0%
about is there's nothing in here to say
 
02:53:07.469 --> 02:53:07.479 align:start position:0%
exactly what the depth of the water is
 
02:53:09.910 --> 02:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
that we're looking for um which would be
 
02:53:11.910 --> 02:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
also very difficult because as
 
02:53:14.429 --> 02:53:14.439 align:start position:0%
previously with Arlington was stated the
 
02:53:16.389 --> 02:53:16.399 align:start position:0%
average depth is 9 ft but what they're
 
02:53:18.990 --> 02:53:19.000 align:start position:0%
forgetting or what they not saying is we
 
02:53:21.229 --> 02:53:21.239 align:start position:0%
have three four five I don't know how
 
02:53:23.349 --> 02:53:23.359 align:start position:0%
many CES of very shallow water with no
 
02:53:25.389 --> 02:53:25.399 align:start position:0%
wake zones that nobody ever goes into so
 
02:53:26.870 --> 02:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
now you throw that into the average and
 
02:53:29.349 --> 02:53:29.359 align:start position:0%
it throws everything off also it was
 
02:53:33.830 --> 02:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned um about the um disturbing the
 
02:53:36.070 --> 02:53:36.080 align:start position:0%
bottom of the lake well rising and
 
02:53:38.030 --> 02:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
lowering the dam disturbs it too because
 
02:53:41.190 --> 02:53:41.200 align:start position:0%
we keep going up and down um as the lake
 
02:53:43.670 --> 02:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
you know Rises and lowers so all that 10
 
02:53:46.910 --> 02:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
ft along the lake is now exposed so I
 
02:53:49.910 --> 02:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
mean there's just as much toxins and
 
02:53:52.510 --> 02:53:52.520 align:start position:0%
whatever on those 10 ft but that all is
 
02:53:56.229 --> 02:53:56.239 align:start position:0%
now exposed to the Sun or the air um
 
02:53:57.870 --> 02:53:57.880 align:start position:0%
also it was brought up they think that
 
02:53:59.510 --> 02:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
this might cause some of the problems
 
02:54:02.229 --> 02:54:02.239 align:start position:0%
with the CYO bacteria but what was not
 
02:54:04.950 --> 02:54:04.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned is that we have drain uh storm
 
02:54:08.910 --> 02:54:08.920 align:start position:0%
drains around around our Watershed that
 
02:54:11.469 --> 02:54:11.479 align:start position:0%
deposit directly into our Lake which is
 
02:54:14.349 --> 02:54:14.359 align:start position:0%
why I put forward the um restrictions on
 
02:54:16.429 --> 02:54:16.439 align:start position:0%
phosphorus because of the number of
 
02:54:18.469 --> 02:54:18.479 align:start position:0%
homes that are in our Watershed that
 
02:54:20.469 --> 02:54:20.479 align:start position:0%
there's no setbacks and all the um
 
02:54:22.150 --> 02:54:22.160 align:start position:0%
fertilizer with phosphorus can then get
 
02:54:23.870 --> 02:54:23.880 align:start position:0%
into the storm drains and come directly
 
02:54:26.349 --> 02:54:26.359 align:start position:0%
and drop into our lake so we have not
 
02:54:29.309 --> 02:54:29.319 align:start position:0%
had a Lake management uh plan done yet
 
02:54:30.830 --> 02:54:30.840 align:start position:0%
we don't know why we have the Cino
 
02:54:32.990 --> 02:54:33.000 align:start position:0%
bacteria we don't know what's causing it
 
02:54:36.190 --> 02:54:36.200 align:start position:0%
and my um fear is that we are using this
 
02:54:39.070 --> 02:54:39.080 align:start position:0%
as a method or someone is deciding that
 
02:54:41.630 --> 02:54:41.640 align:start position:0%
it must be the wake surfing is causing
 
02:54:43.670 --> 02:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
the Sino bacteria but there's so many
 
02:54:46.349 --> 02:54:46.359 align:start position:0%
other um things that could be in there
 
02:54:48.389 --> 02:54:48.399 align:start position:0%
we don't know what it is yet and I think
 
02:54:51.229 --> 02:54:51.239 align:start position:0%
this is a little bit premature um
 
02:54:53.269 --> 02:54:53.279 align:start position:0%
because we have no data to say that
 
02:54:55.630 --> 02:54:55.640 align:start position:0%
that's what's causing our problem in our
 
02:54:58.550 --> 02:54:58.560 align:start position:0%
Lake okay just to follow up Mr shair
 
02:54:58.560 --> 02:55:00.710 align:start position:0%
Lake okay just to follow up Mr shair
yeah

02:55:00.710 --> 02:55:00.720 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:55:04.269 --> 02:55:04.279 align:start position:0%
so what I hear you saying is that if uh
 
02:55:06.389 --> 02:55:06.399 align:start position:0%
multiple petitions come up to the
 
02:55:08.750 --> 02:55:08.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety you would think
 
02:55:10.389 --> 02:55:10.399 align:start position:0%
that eventually they would not make a
 
02:55:13.550 --> 02:55:13.560 align:start position:0%
reasonable and fair decision I'm not
 
02:55:15.269 --> 02:55:15.279 align:start position:0%
saying anything because I don't know the
 
02:55:17.030 --> 02:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
people and I don't know how it works I'm
 
02:55:19.750 --> 02:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
just saying that I think it's going to
 
02:55:22.510 --> 02:55:22.520 align:start position:0%
take up a lot of their time I think that
 
02:55:25.590 --> 02:55:25.600 align:start position:0%
um and I don't be honest with you the
 
02:55:27.190 --> 02:55:27.200 align:start position:0%
research is not there there's so much
 
02:55:29.990 --> 02:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
conflicting research that whoever shows
 
02:55:32.710 --> 02:55:32.720 align:start position:0%
you know the most amount of research I
 
02:55:34.910 --> 02:55:34.920 align:start position:0%
guess it just nothing has been
 
02:55:37.429 --> 02:55:37.439 align:start position:0%
determined yet as to what is causing our
 
02:55:39.510 --> 02:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
Sino bacteria problem nobody's in
 
02:55:41.950 --> 02:55:41.960 align:start position:0%
agreement as to what the wake boards um
 
02:55:44.870 --> 02:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
or the wake surfing does and as I said
 
02:55:46.870 --> 02:55:46.880 align:start position:0%
our boat we've been doing it for 18
 
02:55:46.880 --> 02:55:48.389 align:start position:0%
our boat we've been doing it for 18
years

02:55:48.389 --> 02:55:48.399 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:55:52.269 --> 02:55:52.279 align:start position:0%
um we have we have a much smaller wake
 
02:55:55.030 --> 02:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
so I think if you wanted to really and I
 
02:55:57.150 --> 02:55:57.160 align:start position:0%
I don't even Advocate this but I mean
 
02:55:59.870 --> 02:55:59.880 align:start position:0%
restrict the size of the wakes not this
 
02:56:02.349 --> 02:56:02.359 align:start position:0%
not the sport that's being um done
 
02:56:03.950 --> 02:56:03.960 align:start position:0%
because I just think that another sport
 
02:56:05.550 --> 02:56:05.560 align:start position:0%
will come along that could use the big
 
02:56:06.790 --> 02:56:06.800 align:start position:0%
wake and we're going to be sitting right
 
02:56:10.429 --> 02:56:10.439 align:start position:0%
back here again so deal with the problem
 
02:56:12.910 --> 02:56:12.920 align:start position:0%
not with um the secondary issue which
 
02:56:15.990 --> 02:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
would be the wake surfing okay thank you
 
02:56:17.750 --> 02:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
anyone else have a question to the
 
02:56:20.110 --> 02:56:20.120 align:start position:0%
speaker don't see any thank you very
 
02:56:21.309 --> 02:56:21.319 align:start position:0%
much for your
 
02:56:23.469 --> 02:56:23.479 align:start position:0%
testimony excuse me do you have a copy
 
02:56:26.550 --> 02:56:26.560 align:start position:0%
of your testimony I'll send it in okay
 
02:56:36.190 --> 02:56:36.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:39.030 --> 02:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
address so Lori told me about this
 
02:56:40.349 --> 02:56:40.359 align:start position:0%
proposed bill I don't know a little over
 
02:56:42.429 --> 02:56:42.439 align:start position:0%
a month ago I'll get to this speaker by
 
02:56:43.630 --> 02:56:43.640 align:start position:0%
the way Jim ball sale New Hampshire
 
02:56:47.389 --> 02:56:47.399 align:start position:0%
living on on 18 years as Lori mentioned
 
02:56:50.670 --> 02:56:50.680 align:start position:0%
not as long as Tom 40 something plus
 
02:56:53.710 --> 02:56:53.720 align:start position:0%
right anyhow uh when I first heard about
 
02:56:56.269 --> 02:56:56.279 align:start position:0%
the bill I said that doesn't make sense
 
02:56:57.710 --> 02:56:57.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't you know seem like it's ready
 
02:57:00.190 --> 02:57:00.200 align:start position:0%
for prime time because you're conflating
 
02:57:02.910 --> 02:57:02.920 align:start position:0%
a sport wake surfing to boat waves which
 
02:57:05.469 --> 02:57:05.479 align:start position:0%
might have an impact on the sh Line and
 
02:57:08.750 --> 02:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
other things like cob bacteria etc etc
 
02:57:12.590 --> 02:57:12.600 align:start position:0%
and um you know it just seems to me that
 
02:57:14.229 --> 02:57:14.239 align:start position:0%
it's you know to use a legal ter
 
02:57:16.870 --> 02:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
arbitrary and capricious you pick one
 
02:57:19.550 --> 02:57:19.560 align:start position:0%
sport that uses a big weight maybe
 
02:57:21.190 --> 02:57:21.200 align:start position:0%
sometimes to do the sport but maybe
 
02:57:23.349 --> 02:57:23.359 align:start position:0%
sometimes not to do the sport and you
 
02:57:26.070 --> 02:57:26.080 align:start position:0%
don't consider the other wave activity
 
02:57:29.190 --> 02:57:29.200 align:start position:0%
on the on the lake that also occurs at
 
02:57:32.550 --> 02:57:32.560 align:start position:0%
the same height of waves so let me go
 
02:57:34.790 --> 02:57:34.800 align:start position:0%
back up if I'm I'm a wake Bard wake
 
02:57:37.429 --> 02:57:37.439 align:start position:0%
Surfer while the extreme sports on the
 
02:57:41.469 --> 02:57:41.479 align:start position:0%
lake and uh like Lori said you know when
 
02:57:42.550 --> 02:57:42.560 align:start position:0%
we first moved there we had some
 
02:57:44.830 --> 02:57:44.840 align:start position:0%
Shoreline damage we wrecked up fight it
 
02:57:46.150 --> 02:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
the 18 years we've been living on there
 
02:57:47.670 --> 02:57:47.680 align:start position:0%
was one of the first wakeboard boats on
 
02:57:49.990 --> 02:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
the lake um since then we haven't
 
02:57:51.870 --> 02:57:51.880 align:start position:0%
noticed any particular damage to our
 
02:57:54.030 --> 02:57:54.040 align:start position:0%
property now you know certainly I'm
 
02:57:56.630 --> 02:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
concerned this includes docks boats boat
 
02:57:59.389 --> 02:57:59.399 align:start position:0%
lines whips you know kayaks that are you
 
02:58:02.910 --> 02:58:02.920 align:start position:0%
know hanging out by the beach etc etc so
 
02:58:04.590 --> 02:58:04.600 align:start position:0%
you know that was my observation my
 
02:58:06.750 --> 02:58:06.760 align:start position:0%
anecdotal information on what I saw in
 
02:58:09.229 --> 02:58:09.239 align:start position:0%
terms of Shoreline damage but you know
 
02:58:10.870 --> 02:58:10.880 align:start position:0%
not being an expert on the subject I
 
02:58:13.550 --> 02:58:13.560 align:start position:0%
wanted to go in and really explore the
 
02:58:15.870 --> 02:58:15.880 align:start position:0%
research on it and it was kind of
 
02:58:19.030 --> 02:58:19.040 align:start position:0%
interesting when I uh looked into it is
 
02:58:20.670 --> 02:58:20.680 align:start position:0%
conflicting research just like we see
 
02:58:23.910 --> 02:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
everywhere today um one group I'll you
 
02:58:27.870 --> 02:58:27.880 align:start position:0%
pick the name CR Club is really against
 
02:58:30.710 --> 02:58:30.720 align:start position:0%
wake surfing they say it has devastating
 
02:58:33.030 --> 02:58:33.040 align:start position:0%
impact on the shoreline and other
 
02:58:35.870 --> 02:58:35.880 align:start position:0%
reports by another Industry Group says
 
02:58:37.590 --> 02:58:37.600 align:start position:0%
just the opposite I'll give you two
 
02:58:40.030 --> 02:58:40.040 align:start position:0%
examples we talked about C bacteria and
 
02:58:42.229 --> 02:58:42.239 align:start position:0%
the Wake disturbing the soil phosphorous
 
02:58:44.309 --> 02:58:44.319 align:start position:0%
coming up causing more of a sinac CIA
 
02:58:46.910 --> 02:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
problem it's possible it says could in
 
02:58:48.710 --> 02:58:48.720 align:start position:0%
all the articles but there's no proof of
 
02:58:51.190 --> 02:58:51.200 align:start position:0%
it but there's also information that a
 
02:58:54.229 --> 02:58:54.239 align:start position:0%
deep wave also churns up the water
 
02:58:56.349 --> 02:58:56.359 align:start position:0%
stratification in the pond you know
 
02:58:58.229 --> 02:58:58.239 align:start position:0%
giving more oxygen to the lower levels
 
02:59:00.229 --> 02:59:00.239 align:start position:0%
and actually causing a healthier bottom
 
02:59:01.910 --> 02:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
and a better environment so that you
 
02:59:04.229 --> 02:59:04.239 align:start position:0%
don't have cob bacteria so when I did
 
02:59:06.750 --> 02:59:06.760 align:start position:0%
the research I saw one report saying
 
02:59:08.269 --> 02:59:08.279 align:start position:0%
this and a conflicting report saying
 
02:59:10.349 --> 02:59:10.359 align:start position:0%
that so I kind of wanted to go to see if
 
02:59:11.710 --> 02:59:11.720 align:start position:0%
there are any kind of unbiased
 
02:59:13.349 --> 02:59:13.359 align:start position:0%
peerreview research reports and there
 
02:59:14.550 --> 02:59:14.560 align:start position:0%
are there's a bunch of them I have one
 
02:59:16.510 --> 02:59:16.520 align:start position:0%
here from the University of Minnesota
 
02:59:18.710 --> 02:59:18.720 align:start position:0%
where they looked at 460 lakes in a
 
02:59:20.950 --> 02:59:20.960 align:start position:0%
variety of environments deep Lakes big
 
02:59:23.309 --> 02:59:23.319 align:start position:0%
lakes lakes with you know different Co
 
02:59:25.510 --> 02:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
sizes different depths different types
 
02:59:28.070 --> 02:59:28.080 align:start position:0%
of boats different speeds different uh
 
02:59:29.389 --> 02:59:29.399 align:start position:0%
you know orientations where they have
 
02:59:32.550 --> 02:59:32.560 align:start position:0%
ballast bags or uh the different um
 
02:59:34.389 --> 02:59:34.399 align:start position:0%
hydraulic weight shaping things that
 
02:59:36.550 --> 02:59:36.560 align:start position:0%
they have now in the expensive boats etc
 
02:59:39.710 --> 02:59:39.720 align:start position:0%
etc and the bottom line of it all is
 
02:59:41.150 --> 02:59:41.160 align:start position:0%
that they kind of cancel each other out
 
02:59:42.190 --> 02:59:42.200 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
02:59:44.870 --> 02:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
definitive um information saying that
 
02:59:47.469 --> 02:59:47.479 align:start position:0%
wake surfing as a sport or big wave
 
02:59:49.750 --> 02:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
driven by wake surfing
 
02:59:52.349 --> 02:59:52.359 align:start position:0%
boats um is really the thing that causes
 
02:59:54.269 --> 02:59:54.279 align:start position:0%
all these issues in fact when you go and
 
02:59:57.110 --> 02:59:57.120 align:start position:0%
research what causes the most damage to
 
02:59:59.710 --> 02:59:59.720 align:start position:0%
shorelines at lakes and rivers Etc they
 
03:00:01.429 --> 03:00:01.439 align:start position:0%
don't even talk about boat waves it's
 
03:00:05.790 --> 03:00:05.800 align:start position:0%
all about runoff vegetation being
 
03:00:08.110 --> 03:00:08.120 align:start position:0%
removed all those types of things rather
 
03:00:10.750 --> 03:00:10.760 align:start position:0%
than the waves now waves can contribute
 
03:00:12.630 --> 03:00:12.640 align:start position:0%
but are they the make contributor and do
 
03:00:14.269 --> 03:00:14.279 align:start position:0%
in fact you want to take a
 
03:00:18.030 --> 03:00:18.040 align:start position:0%
contributor and cause all s of Havoc to
 
03:00:19.670 --> 03:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
the recreational capabilities on the
 
03:00:22.670 --> 03:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
lake people's housing values tourism
 
03:00:25.429 --> 03:00:25.439 align:start position:0%
industry jobs all those kind of things
 
03:00:26.510 --> 03:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
it doesn't seem like there's real
 
03:00:28.590 --> 03:00:28.600 align:start position:0%
balance going on here to look at all the
 
03:00:30.349 --> 03:00:30.359 align:start position:0%
pros and cons and unintended
 
03:00:32.910 --> 03:00:32.920 align:start position:0%
consequences that uh come apart of
 
03:00:34.710 --> 03:00:34.720 align:start position:0%
actually Banning something or being able
 
03:00:36.830 --> 03:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
to ban something with a 25 person
 
03:00:39.070 --> 03:00:39.080 align:start position:0%
petition so you know I guess my
 
03:00:41.349 --> 03:00:41.359 align:start position:0%
experience my recommendation my research
 
03:00:45.030 --> 03:00:45.040 align:start position:0%
you know brings me to the point where um
 
03:00:47.830 --> 03:00:47.840 align:start position:0%
you I think we really have to look into
 
03:00:49.710 --> 03:00:49.720 align:start position:0%
doing a lot more research on Lake
 
03:00:51.349 --> 03:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
specific orientations every Lake
 
03:00:53.389 --> 03:00:53.399 align:start position:0%
Topography is different big lakes with
 
03:00:56.670 --> 03:00:56.680 align:start position:0%
Coes shallow Lakes lots of vegetation
 
03:00:59.030 --> 03:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
lakes with steep Banks all those kind of
 
03:01:01.349 --> 03:01:01.359 align:start position:0%
things and see what the real villain is
 
03:01:03.469 --> 03:01:03.479 align:start position:0%
here that's causing all this damage and
 
03:01:06.110 --> 03:01:06.120 align:start position:0%
not necessarily picking out a sport that
 
03:01:08.469 --> 03:01:08.479 align:start position:0%
um you know is really the fastest
 
03:01:10.389 --> 03:01:10.399 align:start position:0%
growing sport in the industry it's
 
03:01:13.190 --> 03:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
growing at 10% per year it's a $2.5
 
03:01:14.950 --> 03:01:14.960 align:start position:0%
billion industry going to five billion
 
03:01:17.670 --> 03:01:17.680 align:start position:0%
in like another five years um and I I
 
03:01:19.070 --> 03:01:19.080 align:start position:0%
kind of agree with Lori it kind of feels
 
03:01:20.510 --> 03:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
like 40 years ago when I started
 
03:01:22.670 --> 03:01:22.680 align:start position:0%
snowboarding the traditional skiers
 
03:01:24.110 --> 03:01:24.120 align:start position:0%
hated it they wanted to kick all the
 
03:01:25.389 --> 03:01:25.399 align:start position:0%
snowboarders off the mountain there was
 
03:01:26.950 --> 03:01:26.960 align:start position:0%
knuckle draggers they made all sorts of
 
03:01:30.710 --> 03:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
noise and it sounded terrible etc etc
 
03:01:33.190 --> 03:01:33.200 align:start position:0%
and there we learned to coexist and I
 
03:01:35.830 --> 03:01:35.840 align:start position:0%
think it was a a benefit to the state
 
03:01:37.870 --> 03:01:37.880 align:start position:0%
and the ski industry that snowboarders
 
03:01:38.910 --> 03:01:38.920 align:start position:0%
did come into the mix because they
 
03:01:40.630 --> 03:01:40.640 align:start position:0%
brought a whole new clientele a whole
 
03:01:43.030 --> 03:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
new Revenue stream all new product bases
 
03:01:45.990 --> 03:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
all new jobs jobs and I think uh you
 
03:01:47.910 --> 03:01:47.920 align:start position:0%
know like I said the bill seems to be
 
03:01:49.870 --> 03:01:49.880 align:start position:0%
arbitrary and capricious needs a lot
 
03:01:52.510 --> 03:01:52.520 align:start position:0%
more research and I think maybe more a
 
03:01:54.550 --> 03:01:54.560 align:start position:0%
better way to go about is to do a par
 
03:01:56.269 --> 03:01:56.279 align:start position:0%
analysis you know it came from an
 
03:01:57.710 --> 03:01:57.720 align:start position:0%
engineering company you look at the
 
03:01:59.349 --> 03:01:59.359 align:start position:0%
problem you look at the top causes of
 
03:02:00.670 --> 03:02:00.680 align:start position:0%
the problem and you go after the most
 
03:02:02.750 --> 03:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
ones that you know are the most
 
03:02:04.830 --> 03:02:04.840 align:start position:0%
egregious the 8020 rule kind of so to
 
03:02:06.550 --> 03:02:06.560 align:start position:0%
speak and I think that's what we need to
 
03:02:09.429 --> 03:02:09.439 align:start position:0%
do here before we go out and put out a
 
03:02:12.190 --> 03:02:12.200 align:start position:0%
bill that seems Half Baked to
 
03:02:15.469 --> 03:02:15.479 align:start position:0%
me my t morning and we will get you
 
03:02:18.030 --> 03:02:18.040 align:start position:0%
copies thank you I did did want to end
 
03:02:20.349 --> 03:02:20.359 align:start position:0%
with one thing this is the the
 
03:02:22.229 --> 03:02:22.239 align:start position:0%
University of michig Minesota study that
 
03:02:25.110 --> 03:02:25.120 align:start position:0%
I mentioned it says I'll read you two
 
03:02:27.269 --> 03:02:27.279 align:start position:0%
sentences the University of Minnesota's
 
03:02:29.110 --> 03:02:29.120 align:start position:0%
study does not recommend a formal
 
03:02:32.030 --> 03:02:32.040 align:start position:0%
setback for wake surfing wakes from wake
 
03:02:33.830 --> 03:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
surfing boats that wash up upon Shores
 
03:02:36.070 --> 03:02:36.080 align:start position:0%
do not inherently degrade shorelines to
 
03:02:37.870 --> 03:02:37.880 align:start position:0%
the contrary according to the University
 
03:02:40.750 --> 03:02:40.760 align:start position:0%
of Minnesota itself Shoreline is driven
 
03:02:45.590 --> 03:02:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:48.309 --> 03:02:48.319 align:start position:0%
so it's the wind it's the ice it's you
 
03:02:49.870 --> 03:02:49.880 align:start position:0%
know other vehicles traveling over the
 
03:02:51.710 --> 03:02:51.720 align:start position:0%
dirt and sand when we lower our Lake six
 
03:02:53.510 --> 03:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
or seven feet every winter there's a
 
03:02:55.550 --> 03:02:55.560 align:start position:0%
whole host of things that you know can
 
03:02:58.150 --> 03:02:58.160 align:start position:0%
contribute to shoreline erosion that are
 
03:03:01.950 --> 03:03:01.960 align:start position:0%
much more egregious than a wake that can
 
03:03:03.469 --> 03:03:03.479 align:start position:0%
be caused not only by a wake surfing
 
03:03:05.910 --> 03:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
boat but by all sorts of boats any boat
 
03:03:07.950 --> 03:03:07.960 align:start position:0%
has a v-shaped hell if you drive at 10
 
03:03:09.670 --> 03:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
15 miles hour you're going to throw one
 
03:03:11.190 --> 03:03:11.200 align:start position:0%
and a half to two foot
 
03:03:14.429 --> 03:03:14.439 align:start position:0%
wake and there some the research I also
 
03:03:16.790 --> 03:03:16.800 align:start position:0%
saw is that the velocity of the Wake has
 
03:03:18.190 --> 03:03:18.200 align:start position:0%
a lot more to do with it than the size
 
03:03:19.910 --> 03:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
of the Wake so if you're planed off with
 
03:03:22.309 --> 03:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
a water ski going 25 miles hour a one
 
03:03:24.830 --> 03:03:24.840 align:start position:0%
and a half foot wave from that ski booat
 
03:03:26.150 --> 03:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
is going to be more damaging to the
 
03:03:28.030 --> 03:03:28.040 align:start position:0%
Shoreline than a two and a half foot
 
03:03:29.750 --> 03:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
wake surf weight that's only going 12
 
03:03:33.429 --> 03:03:33.439 align:start position:0%
miles an hour so I think a lot more work
 
03:03:35.190 --> 03:03:35.200 align:start position:0%
needs to be done to evaluate what's
 
03:03:36.990 --> 03:03:37.000 align:start position:0%
really causing the
 
03:03:40.269 --> 03:03:40.279 align:start position:0%
issues any questions for us
 
03:03:42.590 --> 03:03:42.600 align:start position:0%
speaker seeing none I thank you for your
 
03:03:42.600 --> 03:03:44.710 align:start position:0%
speaker seeing none I thank you for your
testimony

03:03:48.150 --> 03:03:48.160 align:start position:0%
also opposing the bill I I can't read
 
03:03:50.150 --> 03:03:50.160 align:start position:0%

03:04:01.030 --> 03:04:01.040 align:start position:0%
Ryan
 
03:04:04.469 --> 03:04:04.479 align:start position:0%
she Ryan what's your last name um La
 
03:04:12.389 --> 03:04:12.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:12.399 --> 03:04:13.950 align:start position:0%
 
you

03:04:13.950 --> 03:04:13.960 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:04:16.510 --> 03:04:16.520 align:start position:0%
okay um hi everyone my name is Ryan the
 
03:04:18.590 --> 03:04:18.600 align:start position:0%
Liberty I'm from Bo New Hampshire and
 
03:04:20.710 --> 03:04:20.720 align:start position:0%
I'm here to testify against House Bill
 
03:04:23.670 --> 03:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
1301 for me being on the boat is about H
 
03:04:25.190 --> 03:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
is about family time and not being on
 
03:04:26.790 --> 03:04:26.800 align:start position:0%
our screens enjoying and noticing the
 
03:04:29.110 --> 03:04:29.120 align:start position:0%
things we have and what's around us now
 
03:04:30.389 --> 03:04:30.399 align:start position:0%
many of you might think that this bill
 
03:04:31.670 --> 03:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
is good to have but there are many
 
03:04:33.429 --> 03:04:33.439 align:start position:0%
downfalls to this for myself and other
 
03:04:35.590 --> 03:04:35.600 align:start position:0%
wake boo owners I'm sure many of these
 
03:04:37.030 --> 03:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
people who have testified are going to
 
03:04:39.469 --> 03:04:39.479 align:start position:0%
testify haven't been on a wake booat see
 
03:04:40.710 --> 03:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
if you've been on a wake booat it is
 
03:04:42.110 --> 03:04:42.120 align:start position:0%
very quiet and slow if you're serving
 
03:04:45.510 --> 03:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
like me the problem with this bill is
 
03:04:46.990 --> 03:04:47.000 align:start position:0%
the problem with this bill could be that
 
03:04:48.710 --> 03:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
there would be limited options for lake
 
03:04:50.950 --> 03:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
to go to if you own a wake booat and it
 
03:04:52.349 --> 03:04:52.359 align:start position:0%
can even be harder for the driver since
 
03:04:53.990 --> 03:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
the boats are forced into the middle
 
03:04:55.990 --> 03:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
many camps are rent for people who do
 
03:04:58.269 --> 03:04:58.279 align:start position:0%
water sports this B can affect those
 
03:05:00.229 --> 03:05:00.239 align:start position:0%
camps in many ways when trying to find
 
03:05:02.389 --> 03:05:02.399 align:start position:0%
information about wake boats or even any
 
03:05:03.990 --> 03:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
boat there's a common denominator in New
 
03:05:05.469 --> 03:05:05.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that everyone says that owning
 
03:05:07.349 --> 03:05:07.359 align:start position:0%
a boat is about spending family time and
 
03:05:09.469 --> 03:05:09.479 align:start position:0%
doing what you love this impact this
 
03:05:11.269 --> 03:05:11.279 align:start position:0%
bill can impact Surfers like myself
 
03:05:12.910 --> 03:05:12.920 align:start position:0%
because there can be too many people out
 
03:05:14.750 --> 03:05:14.760 align:start position:0%
in the lake surfing at the same time
 
03:05:16.349 --> 03:05:16.359 align:start position:0%
making it hard for the driver and the
 
03:05:18.590 --> 03:05:18.600 align:start position:0%
surfer last time I had to write a speech
 
03:05:20.150 --> 03:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
for something like this and over the
 
03:05:22.269 --> 03:05:22.279 align:start position:0%
summer I was thinking about how
 
03:05:23.630 --> 03:05:23.640 align:start position:0%
different the lake would be with this
 
03:05:25.710 --> 03:05:25.720 align:start position:0%
bill nothing would be the same not camps
 
03:05:27.710 --> 03:05:27.720 align:start position:0%
or family weekends on the boat these
 
03:05:29.110 --> 03:05:29.120 align:start position:0%
boats brought me and I'm sure other
 
03:05:31.790 --> 03:05:31.800 align:start position:0%
people so many memories it wouldn't be
 
03:05:33.070 --> 03:05:33.080 align:start position:0%
the same with this bill I appreciate
 
03:05:35.910 --> 03:05:35.920 align:start position:0%
your time and consideration thank you
 
03:05:38.590 --> 03:05:38.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Ryan anyone have a question
 
03:05:38.600 --> 03:05:39.790 align:start position:0%
thank you Ryan anyone have a question
for

03:05:39.790 --> 03:05:39.800 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:05:42.630 --> 03:05:42.640 align:start position:0%
Ryan no we thank you we appreciate your
 
03:05:52.670 --> 03:05:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:56.469 --> 03:05:56.479 align:start position:0%
you just pass it up one one one side of
 
03:06:02.670 --> 03:06:02.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:05.630 --> 03:06:05.640 align:start position:0%
Deacon see he's still here
 
03:06:10.630 --> 03:06:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:13.750 --> 03:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire guess he left Jeff one more
 
03:06:13.760 --> 03:06:14.950 align:start position:0%
Hampshire guess he left Jeff one more
time

03:06:14.950 --> 03:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:06:25.710 --> 03:06:25.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:28.269 --> 03:06:28.279 align:start position:0%
Evan there my name is EV Golder I live
 
03:06:30.590 --> 03:06:30.600 align:start position:0%
in B New Hampshire and I own a summer
 
03:06:33.429 --> 03:06:33.439 align:start position:0%
camp for kids we focus on water sports
 
03:06:35.910 --> 03:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
wake boarding uh wake surfing water
 
03:06:40.309 --> 03:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
skiing I'm gonna not sorry I'm going to
 
03:06:42.110 --> 03:06:42.120 align:start position:0%
not read this right now because like it
 
03:06:43.510 --> 03:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
rehashes everything everyone's talked
 
03:06:46.750 --> 03:06:46.760 align:start position:0%
about but basically I have taught water
 
03:06:49.910 --> 03:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
sports uh since 2004 and I added wake
 
03:06:51.550 --> 03:06:51.560 align:start position:0%
surfing to that in
 
03:06:53.630 --> 03:06:53.640 align:start position:0%
2011 when it when it became a little
 
03:06:55.630 --> 03:06:55.640 align:start position:0%
more prominent over here um I've driven
 
03:06:58.389 --> 03:06:58.399 align:start position:0%
boats thousands and thousands of hours
 
03:07:01.670 --> 03:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
all summer long um my my main lake is um
 
03:07:03.670 --> 03:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
marry meeting in central New Hampshire
 
03:07:05.710 --> 03:07:05.720 align:start position:0%
but I've traveled to dozens of other
 
03:07:08.990 --> 03:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
water bodies Rivers ponds Lakes um all
 
03:07:11.349 --> 03:07:11.359 align:start position:0%
over New England and it's a amazing fun
 
03:07:12.670 --> 03:07:12.680 align:start position:0%
job I get to interact with a lot of
 
03:07:15.630 --> 03:07:15.640 align:start position:0%
people and I just want to say that um if
 
03:07:17.110 --> 03:07:17.120 align:start position:0%
I could represent a lot of people I work
 
03:07:19.550 --> 03:07:19.560 align:start position:0%
with they are not fortunate enough to
 
03:07:22.389 --> 03:07:22.399 align:start position:0%
have a lake house a boat access direct
 
03:07:24.830 --> 03:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
access to water they have no say in this
 
03:07:27.190 --> 03:07:27.200 align:start position:0%
kind of bill um it's unfortunate we get
 
03:07:29.790 --> 03:07:29.800 align:start position:0%
I get people from you know four years
 
03:07:31.750 --> 03:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
old to in their 80s we get in the boat
 
03:07:33.630 --> 03:07:33.640 align:start position:0%
we have a blast they might come for one
 
03:07:35.590 --> 03:07:35.600 align:start position:0%
day to New Hampshire they might stay for
 
03:07:38.510 --> 03:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
a week they might buy a house they might
 
03:07:40.910 --> 03:07:40.920 align:start position:0%
rent a place um it brings a lot of
 
03:07:43.269 --> 03:07:43.279 align:start position:0%
people to our state um and they they
 
03:07:44.710 --> 03:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
would not have a say in this kind of
 
03:07:46.550 --> 03:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
Bill I think that's unfortunate it's un
 
03:07:49.590 --> 03:07:49.600 align:start position:0%
undem undemocratic um it takes you know
 
03:07:51.750 --> 03:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
the regulation of our water bodies away
 
03:07:53.830 --> 03:07:53.840 align:start position:0%
from the elected the elected
 
03:07:56.269 --> 03:07:56.279 align:start position:0%
representatives and it gives it to a a
 
03:07:58.389 --> 03:07:58.399 align:start position:0%
minority of people in our state who are
 
03:08:01.269 --> 03:08:01.279 align:start position:0%
so fortunate to have Lakefront uh access
 
03:08:03.469 --> 03:08:03.479 align:start position:0%
or or a Butters to that um you know
 
03:08:05.750 --> 03:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
growing up in New Hampshire I would have
 
03:08:07.269 --> 03:08:07.279 align:start position:0%
killed for a lake house it's all I
 
03:08:09.469 --> 03:08:09.479 align:start position:0%
wanted um I blame my dad for my my
 
03:08:10.630 --> 03:08:10.640 align:start position:0%
career right now because he wouldn't get
 
03:08:12.469 --> 03:08:12.479 align:start position:0%
a lake house for us so like I made this
 
03:08:16.229 --> 03:08:16.239 align:start position:0%
my my job um and so many people are in
 
03:08:18.309 --> 03:08:18.319 align:start position:0%
the same boat where they don't have
 
03:08:20.830 --> 03:08:20.840 align:start position:0%
access and they come to New Hampshire
 
03:08:23.229 --> 03:08:23.239 align:start position:0%
for our gorgeous Lakes um they rent a
 
03:08:24.590 --> 03:08:24.600 align:start position:0%
boat or they come to a place like me
 
03:08:26.670 --> 03:08:26.680 align:start position:0%
where they can get on the boat um and
 
03:08:31.030 --> 03:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
wake surfing is limitlessly available to
 
03:08:32.910 --> 03:08:32.920 align:start position:0%
everyone I have taken out people like I
 
03:08:34.910 --> 03:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
said four years old all the way to their
 
03:08:38.110 --> 03:08:38.120 align:start position:0%
80s it's low impact um I can talk to
 
03:08:39.790 --> 03:08:39.800 align:start position:0%
them right behind the boat they can hear
 
03:08:42.190 --> 03:08:42.200 align:start position:0%
me it's low stress we've had people with
 
03:08:44.150 --> 03:08:44.160 align:start position:0%
disabilities we've had um you know
 
03:08:46.550 --> 03:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
Wounded Warriors anyone that that wants
 
03:08:48.790 --> 03:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
to can wake surf um so I think we're
 
03:08:50.710 --> 03:08:50.720 align:start position:0%
forgetting a little bit about how
 
03:08:52.710 --> 03:08:52.720 align:start position:0%
amazing the sport is how much it's
 
03:08:54.670 --> 03:08:54.680 align:start position:0%
broadened the appeal of water sports and
 
03:08:57.269 --> 03:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
recreation to to families all over the
 
03:09:00.030 --> 03:09:00.040 align:start position:0%
all over the country um so I I would
 
03:09:03.030 --> 03:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
really oppose this bill just because you
 
03:09:05.870 --> 03:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
know good for whoever you own a lak
 
03:09:07.710 --> 03:09:07.720 align:start position:0%
front house that is amazing you are
 
03:09:10.469 --> 03:09:10.479 align:start position:0%
fortunate enjoy the lake I believe
 
03:09:12.309 --> 03:09:12.319 align:start position:0%
everyone can share and enjoy Lake
 
03:09:14.590 --> 03:09:14.600 align:start position:0%
together and that's something I've seen
 
03:09:16.389 --> 03:09:16.399 align:start position:0%
uh in the last 20 years of teaching this
 
03:09:18.429 --> 03:09:18.439 align:start position:0%
stuff I've seen everyone get along I've
 
03:09:20.750 --> 03:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
seen fishermen and kayakers and swimmers
 
03:09:24.269 --> 03:09:24.279 align:start position:0%
and wake Surfers coexist with minimal
 
03:09:26.469 --> 03:09:26.479 align:start position:0%
issues I've never seen a wake surfing
 
03:09:28.030 --> 03:09:28.040 align:start position:0%
injury I've seen wakeboarding injuries
 
03:09:30.510 --> 03:09:30.520 align:start position:0%
I've seen water skiing injuries not one
 
03:09:33.269 --> 03:09:33.279 align:start position:0%
wake surfing injury um to the direct
 
03:09:35.870 --> 03:09:35.880 align:start position:0%
Surfer to someone on the boat to someone
 
03:09:38.750 --> 03:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
passing by it is a slow predictable
 
03:09:40.670 --> 03:09:40.680 align:start position:0%
Driving Experience if you see a wake
 
03:09:43.110 --> 03:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
surfing boat coming at you I mean it's
 
03:09:44.910 --> 03:09:44.920 align:start position:0%
like Austin Powers with the steamroller
 
03:09:47.710 --> 03:09:47.720 align:start position:0%
you've got years to avoid that boat
 
03:09:49.910 --> 03:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
because they're going 10 miles an hour
 
03:09:51.630 --> 03:09:51.640 align:start position:0%
um I appreciate some of the concerns
 
03:09:54.349 --> 03:09:54.359 align:start position:0%
I've heard um you know if we all Drive
 
03:09:56.550 --> 03:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
our boats responsibly we can get along
 
03:09:59.150 --> 03:09:59.160 align:start position:0%
we can preserve our our Lakes I do think
 
03:10:01.070 --> 03:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
the the key to this is increasing
 
03:10:02.990 --> 03:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
support for Marine Patrol I work closely
 
03:10:04.510 --> 03:10:04.520 align:start position:0%
as a summer camp in New Hampshire with
 
03:10:07.750 --> 03:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
Marine Patrol with Dees with DHHS um
 
03:10:09.030 --> 03:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
give them the resources to do what
 
03:10:11.110 --> 03:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
they're doing and protect our Lakes
 
03:10:12.990 --> 03:10:13.000 align:start position:0%
there's also some great nonprofits like
 
03:10:16.429 --> 03:10:16.439 align:start position:0%
the tree society and selt uh like at our
 
03:10:18.070 --> 03:10:18.080 align:start position:0%
particular Lake we've we've conserved
 
03:10:20.510 --> 03:10:20.520 align:start position:0%
over 2,000 acres of land to help
 
03:10:22.550 --> 03:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
preserve our water quality because it's
 
03:10:24.070 --> 03:10:24.080 align:start position:0%
all about like the runoff and keeping
 
03:10:26.389 --> 03:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
the Lakes clean um so I'm all for clean
 
03:10:28.590 --> 03:10:28.600 align:start position:0%
Lakes I'm obsessed with the environment
 
03:10:31.710 --> 03:10:31.720 align:start position:0%
um I love being in the outdoors and um
 
03:10:33.710 --> 03:10:33.720 align:start position:0%
yeah so I I do oppose this bill happy to
 
03:10:36.110 --> 03:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
take questions any questions for this
 
03:10:36.120 --> 03:10:38.870 align:start position:0%
take questions any questions for this
speaker

03:10:38.870 --> 03:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
speaker
 
03:10:42.070 --> 03:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
representative well thank you sure uh
 
03:10:44.309 --> 03:10:44.319 align:start position:0%
with all the exper expence you have
 
03:10:46.670 --> 03:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
going to different bodies of water are
 
03:10:49.349 --> 03:10:49.359 align:start position:0%
there some ponds or lakes that you think
 
03:10:52.030 --> 03:10:52.040 align:start position:0%
would be inappropriate to bring your
 
03:10:55.590 --> 03:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
weight totally totally I mean um I I did
 
03:10:57.870 --> 03:10:57.880 align:start position:0%
a water ski lesson on a family's boat on
 
03:10:59.269 --> 03:10:59.279 align:start position:0%
a tiny I forget the name if it was a
 
03:11:01.550 --> 03:11:01.560 align:start position:0%
little Pond you would not wake surf
 
03:11:03.110 --> 03:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
there um you would destroy your
 
03:11:05.110 --> 03:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
propeller your boat you wouldn't create
 
03:11:09.510 --> 03:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
a good wake um it would be I mean not in
 
03:11:10.910 --> 03:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
anyone's interest you wouldn't you
 
03:11:12.150 --> 03:11:12.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to create the Wake to
 
03:11:13.550 --> 03:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
wake surf
 
03:11:17.710 --> 03:11:17.720 align:start position:0%
but to I mean I've just there's so much
 
03:11:19.030 --> 03:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
about this bill I don't I don't agree
 
03:11:21.150 --> 03:11:21.160 align:start position:0%
with it's just it's just silly like why
 
03:11:23.309 --> 03:11:23.319 align:start position:0%
would a boater go to that pond to wake
 
03:11:25.510 --> 03:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
surf they would immediately turn around
 
03:11:26.670 --> 03:11:26.680 align:start position:0%
their boat probably couldn't even get in
 
03:11:30.269 --> 03:11:30.279 align:start position:0%
there um so it's a lot of common sense
 
03:11:33.429 --> 03:11:33.439 align:start position:0%
and most wake boats stay where they live
 
03:11:35.349 --> 03:11:35.359 align:start position:0%
these are big boats there's not a ton of
 
03:11:37.510 --> 03:11:37.520 align:start position:0%
trailering so my property is next to the
 
03:11:39.110 --> 03:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
public launch at our Our Lake so I get
 
03:11:41.030 --> 03:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
to see you know every it's really
 
03:11:42.110 --> 03:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
entertaining to watch people trailer
 
03:11:44.429 --> 03:11:44.439 align:start position:0%
boats into the Lake it's it's hilarious
 
03:11:45.750 --> 03:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
but I I get to see every single person
 
03:11:47.030 --> 03:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
that comes in and out and it's mostly
 
03:11:48.670 --> 03:11:48.680 align:start position:0%
fishermen moving boats back and forth
 
03:11:49.830 --> 03:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
they like to fish different spots
 
03:11:51.590 --> 03:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
there's tournaments there's uh all sorts
 
03:11:53.110 --> 03:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
of stuff I don't fish I don't know but
 
03:11:56.590 --> 03:11:56.600 align:start position:0%
um um wake boats in general they stay
 
03:11:59.229 --> 03:11:59.239 align:start position:0%
where you put them um and people don't
 
03:12:00.990 --> 03:12:01.000 align:start position:0%
really travel too much with them there's
 
03:12:02.150 --> 03:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
the exceptions people coming if they
 
03:12:03.590 --> 03:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
rent for a week or so they'll bring
 
03:12:05.590 --> 03:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
their boat with them but I don't see too
 
03:12:07.150 --> 03:12:07.160 align:start position:0%
much of like a a day trip or putting
 
03:12:09.150 --> 03:12:09.160 align:start position:0%
into a lake that they don't know if that
 
03:12:09.160 --> 03:12:11.070 align:start position:0%
into a lake that they don't know if that
makes

03:12:11.070 --> 03:12:11.080 align:start position:0%
makes
 
03:12:13.110 --> 03:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
sense any other questions question for
 
03:12:13.120 --> 03:12:14.309 align:start position:0%
sense any other questions question for
the

03:12:14.309 --> 03:12:14.319 align:start position:0%

there's I've introduced more adults
 
03:13:42.710 --> 03:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
since I've had a wig boat because it's
 
03:13:44.269 --> 03:13:44.279 align:start position:0%
low impact it's all been said but
 
03:13:46.150 --> 03:13:46.160 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that I've been able to
 
03:13:48.510 --> 03:13:48.520 align:start position:0%
do with my teenage kids starting at age
 
03:13:51.910 --> 03:13:51.920 align:start position:0%

compartment and they don't touch them
 
03:13:57.110 --> 03:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
five hours of the best fun you could
 
03:13:59.670 --> 03:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
ever have so when you start picking a
 
03:14:01.550 --> 03:14:01.560 align:start position:0%

I'm Rosemary rang I represent Hillsboro
 
03:17:58.229 --> 03:17:58.239 align:start position:0%
12 which is the town of miramac I'm
 
03:18:00.229 --> 03:18:00.239 align:start position:0%
going to do my best to get us back on
 
03:18:04.429 --> 03:18:04.439 align:start position:0%
track um and say that as co-sponsor of
 
03:18:06.630 --> 03:18:06.640 align:start position:0%
1401 I have worked with the prime
 
03:18:09.750 --> 03:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative McGee from Hollis
 
03:18:12.710 --> 03:18:12.720 align:start position:0%
and we have made the decision
 
03:18:14.469 --> 03:18:14.479 align:start position:0%
with the town leadership of the town of
 
03:18:17.429 --> 03:18:17.439 align:start position:0%
Hollis that this bill isn't ready yet um
 
03:18:20.469 --> 03:18:20.479 align:start position:0%
it came about because Silver Lake Park
 
03:18:23.670 --> 03:18:23.680 align:start position:0%
in Hollis which ab buts Silver Lake has
 
03:18:26.110 --> 03:18:26.120 align:start position:0%
had years and year Decades of
 
03:18:28.710 --> 03:18:28.720 align:start position:0%
environmental issues that pose a health
 
03:18:31.830 --> 03:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
risk to any visitors to the lake vehical
 
03:18:36.189 --> 03:18:36.199 align:start position:0%
contamination cyano bacteria blooms and
 
03:18:40.790 --> 03:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
um there was the sense that um if the
 
03:18:42.710 --> 03:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
department or the division of State
 
03:18:45.150 --> 03:18:45.160 align:start position:0%
parkks returned ownership to the town of
 
03:18:46.950 --> 03:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
Hollis who originally own that property
 
03:18:48.750 --> 03:18:48.760 align:start position:0%
that perhaps the town could be more
 
03:18:51.550 --> 03:18:51.560 align:start position:0%
successful in ensuring the health of the
 
03:18:55.110 --> 03:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
lake um there are members of the town uh
 
03:18:57.590 --> 03:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
Town leadership that in principle
 
03:18:59.790 --> 03:18:59.800 align:start position:0%
support you know and want to look into
 
03:19:01.269 --> 03:19:01.279 align:start position:0%
it more but they feel like they're not
 
03:19:04.510 --> 03:19:04.520 align:start position:0%
in a position yet to um take ownership
 
03:19:07.349 --> 03:19:07.359 align:start position:0%
should this bill pass um according to
 
03:19:10.269 --> 03:19:10.279 align:start position:0%
house rules we have gone beyond the
 
03:19:14.110 --> 03:19:14.120 align:start position:0%
deadline of withdrawing bill so what um
 
03:19:16.269 --> 03:19:16.279 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor and I uh would like
 
03:19:19.630 --> 03:19:19.640 align:start position:0%
the committee is to we'd like you to um
 
03:19:21.750 --> 03:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
vote on a recommendation of
 
03:19:24.990 --> 03:19:25.000 align:start position:0%
itl um and that's probably the most
 
03:19:27.070 --> 03:19:27.080 align:start position:0%
efficient way of making this bill go
 
03:19:30.590 --> 03:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
away until another another year when it
 
03:19:34.550 --> 03:19:34.560 align:start position:0%

in the state of New
 
03:24:32.630 --> 03:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I think it's important to
 
03:24:35.469 --> 03:24:35.479 align:start position:0%
start out by saying that um in crafting
 
03:24:37.309 --> 03:24:37.319 align:start position:0%
this bill I recognize the importance of
 
03:24:37.319 --> 03:24:38.269 align:start position:0%
this bill I recognize the importance of
not

03:24:38.269 --> 03:24:38.279 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:24:40.950 --> 03:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
mandating any particular uh management
 
03:24:43.830 --> 03:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
strategy on on our public land I believe
 
03:24:45.469 --> 03:24:45.479 align:start position:0%
I know that the division of
 
03:24:47.870 --> 03:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
Forestry uh in the department is Staff
 
03:24:49.910 --> 03:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
with capable people experts who
 
03:24:52.830 --> 03:24:52.840 align:start position:0%
recognize our state's priorities in
 
03:24:55.070 --> 03:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
managing the most valued natural
 
03:24:56.790 --> 03:24:56.800 align:start position:0%
resource we have in order to meet the
 
03:24:59.309 --> 03:24:59.319 align:start position:0%
various functions that we require of our
 
03:25:02.309 --> 03:25:02.319 align:start position:0%
public lands and particular Forest
 
03:25:04.630 --> 03:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
lands uh this bill came about as a
 
03:25:06.670 --> 03:25:06.680 align:start position:0%
result of discussion with the department
 
03:25:09.710 --> 03:25:09.720 align:start position:0%
and with Advocates of old growth forests
 
03:25:13.030 --> 03:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
old growth forests are receiv receiving
 
03:25:14.910 --> 03:25:14.920 align:start position:0%
scrutiny and added value across the
 
03:25:16.710 --> 03:25:16.720 align:start position:0%
country and indeed around the
 
03:25:19.189 --> 03:25:19.199 align:start position:0%
world as we seek to fight the threat of
 
03:25:22.110 --> 03:25:22.120 align:start position:0%
climate change it's a given now that in
 
03:25:24.790 --> 03:25:24.800 align:start position:0%
terms of avoiding the worst impacts of
 
03:25:26.510 --> 03:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
climate change we're not only going to
 
03:25:28.670 --> 03:25:28.680 align:start position:0%
have to stop our use of fossil fuels
 
03:25:30.229 --> 03:25:30.239 align:start position:0%
that are pumping out gases into the
 
03:25:31.309 --> 03:25:31.319 align:start position:0%
atmosphere but we're going to actually
 
03:25:33.870 --> 03:25:33.880 align:start position:0%
have to draw down some of that carbon
 
03:25:35.550 --> 03:25:35.560 align:start position:0%
that's already in there in order to
 
03:25:36.990 --> 03:25:37.000 align:start position:0%
avoid the worst
 
03:25:39.510 --> 03:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
impacts and so uh with that knowledge
 
03:25:41.950 --> 03:25:41.960 align:start position:0%
you see uh all sorts of innov ation
 
03:25:44.150 --> 03:25:44.160 align:start position:0%
going uh on there's companies all over
 
03:25:45.670 --> 03:25:45.680 align:start position:0%
the place coming up with these machines
 
03:25:48.309 --> 03:25:48.319 align:start position:0%
you've probably seen the stories of uh
 
03:25:49.950 --> 03:25:49.960 align:start position:0%
these machines that can suck the air out
 
03:25:52.189 --> 03:25:52.199 align:start position:0%
of uh you know filter out the carbon
 
03:25:54.790 --> 03:25:54.800 align:start position:0%
dioxide and pump it very energy
 
03:25:56.429 --> 03:25:56.439 align:start position:0%
intensive and uh you know
 
03:25:58.590 --> 03:25:58.600 align:start position:0%
technologically intensive machines we
 
03:26:00.389 --> 03:26:00.399 align:start position:0%
have some of those machines in in our
 
03:26:03.110 --> 03:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
state they're called trees uh they
 
03:26:06.229 --> 03:26:06.239 align:start position:0%
already do that and the best ones at the
 
03:26:08.950 --> 03:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
job are the big old
 
03:26:11.590 --> 03:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
ones so New Hampshire's uni unique
 
03:26:14.189 --> 03:26:14.199 align:start position:0%
blessed with the vast Forest cover much
 
03:26:16.469 --> 03:26:16.479 align:start position:0%
of it on public land state parks the
 
03:26:19.469 --> 03:26:19.479 align:start position:0%
White Mountain National Forest Our Town
 
03:26:22.189 --> 03:26:22.199 align:start position:0%
Forest how much of this contains the old
 
03:26:25.070 --> 03:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
growth uh there are estimates but
 
03:26:26.750 --> 03:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
there's much to find out and much to
 
03:26:28.510 --> 03:26:28.520 align:start position:0%
identify and
 
03:26:31.150 --> 03:26:31.160 align:start position:0%
map This Is Our Land it's the public
 
03:26:34.710 --> 03:26:34.720 align:start position:0%
land and our for is resource the public
 
03:26:37.229 --> 03:26:37.239 align:start position:0%
right to know is essential in the proper
 
03:26:40.229 --> 03:26:40.239 align:start position:0%
functioning of our democracy it's like a
 
03:26:43.630 --> 03:26:43.640 align:start position:0%
family's finances you can't manage your
 
03:26:45.910 --> 03:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
finances if you don't know what's in
 
03:26:47.990 --> 03:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
your bank account indeed if you don't
 
03:26:49.750 --> 03:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
even know where the deposits
 
03:26:52.110 --> 03:26:52.120 align:start position:0%
are that's what this bill is intended to
 
03:26:54.429 --> 03:26:54.439 align:start position:0%
do on behalf of the people the owners of
 
03:26:57.150 --> 03:26:57.160 align:start position:0%
the resource to identify old growth and
 
03:26:59.510 --> 03:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
mature Forest on public lands that have
 
03:27:01.950 --> 03:27:01.960 align:start position:0%
the potential to be useful in terms of
 
03:27:03.990 --> 03:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
forest carbon storage flood and drought
 
03:27:05.710 --> 03:27:05.720 align:start position:0%
mitigation water quality and
 
03:27:05.720 --> 03:27:07.389 align:start position:0%
mitigation water quality and
biodiversity

03:27:07.389 --> 03:27:07.399 align:start position:0%
biodiversity
 
03:27:09.389 --> 03:27:09.399 align:start position:0%
protection it will involve the
 
03:27:12.590 --> 03:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
department in a process
 
03:27:17.229 --> 03:27:17.239 align:start position:0%
of defining first of all Define what old
 
03:27:18.870 --> 03:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
growth forest characteristics and what
 
03:27:21.309 --> 03:27:21.319 align:start position:0%
mature Forest characteristics are and
 
03:27:23.229 --> 03:27:23.239 align:start position:0%
how they fit into those used
 
03:27:25.630 --> 03:27:25.640 align:start position:0%
categories this process ideally would
 
03:27:27.830 --> 03:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
involve all the stakeholders in managing
 
03:27:29.510 --> 03:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
public lands and should be open to
 
03:27:31.550 --> 03:27:31.560 align:start position:0%
public participation and
 
03:27:33.590 --> 03:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
comment and I'm willing to offer an
 
03:27:35.630 --> 03:27:35.640 align:start position:0%
amendment to the bill with language to
 
03:27:37.670 --> 03:27:37.680 align:start position:0%
this effect uh if the committee is
 
03:27:38.990 --> 03:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
interested in
 
03:27:41.110 --> 03:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
that I would like to say something about
 
03:27:44.229 --> 03:27:44.239 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note attached to this bill I
 
03:27:45.910 --> 03:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
can only assume that the department is
 
03:27:47.710 --> 03:27:47.720 align:start position:0%
reaching out to potential partners that
 
03:27:49.950 --> 03:27:49.960 align:start position:0%
may be able to contribute expertise and
 
03:27:52.469 --> 03:27:52.479 align:start position:0%
Manpower such as the US Forest Service
 
03:27:54.429 --> 03:27:54.439 align:start position:0%
and Forestry Departments of neighboring
 
03:27:57.590 --> 03:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
states working on similar
 
03:28:00.189 --> 03:28:00.199 align:start position:0%
tasks but in in any case given the
 
03:28:02.510 --> 03:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
Surplus and budgets that we are uh we're
 
03:28:05.349 --> 03:28:05.359 align:start position:0%
we're currently enjoying I can think of
 
03:28:07.750 --> 03:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
no task more entral than long-term
 
03:28:09.710 --> 03:28:09.720 align:start position:0%
planning for management of New
 
03:28:12.389 --> 03:28:12.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's valuable public for
 
03:28:14.590 --> 03:28:14.600 align:start position:0%
resource as I said such planning and
 
03:28:16.110 --> 03:28:16.120 align:start position:0%
decision- making can't be carried out
 
03:28:18.110 --> 03:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
without the knowledge that comes with
 
03:28:20.950 --> 03:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
identifying and mapping what we have
 
03:28:22.630 --> 03:28:22.640 align:start position:0%
it's the Public's right to know that is
 
03:28:25.910 --> 03:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
the basic Foundation of this work uh and
 
03:28:27.429 --> 03:28:27.439 align:start position:0%
with that I'll try to answer any
 
03:28:29.309 --> 03:28:29.319 align:start position:0%
questions the committee has and uh I
 
03:28:30.670 --> 03:28:30.680 align:start position:0%
think there are some technical experts
 
03:28:33.030 --> 03:28:33.040 align:start position:0%
coming up behind me so save those
 
03:28:34.750 --> 03:28:34.760 align:start position:0%
questions for people who might know more
 
03:28:37.950 --> 03:28:37.960 align:start position:0%
about that those kind of things thank
 
03:28:40.189 --> 03:28:40.199 align:start position:0%
representative wolf has a
 
03:28:43.550 --> 03:28:43.560 align:start position:0%
question when you say all public lands
 
03:28:46.590 --> 03:28:46.600 align:start position:0%
are you talking just State lands or all
 
03:28:49.670 --> 03:28:49.680 align:start position:0%
public lands we have a huge natural
 
03:28:51.990 --> 03:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
National Forest yeah yeah I understand
 
03:28:54.510 --> 03:28:54.520 align:start position:0%
that uh the national forest is you know
 
03:28:57.950 --> 03:28:57.960 align:start position:0%
an interesting part of this equation and
 
03:29:00.229 --> 03:29:00.239 align:start position:0%
I I did consider that uh you know when I
 
03:29:02.750 --> 03:29:02.760 align:start position:0%
was uh writing this bill but I think we
 
03:29:03.670 --> 03:29:03.680 align:start position:0%
we can
 
03:29:07.269 --> 03:29:07.279 align:start position:0%
easily incorporate the US National Force
 
03:29:09.790 --> 03:29:09.800 align:start position:0%
into this study physically because
 
03:29:12.070 --> 03:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
they're already doing this in the US
 
03:29:15.030 --> 03:29:15.040 align:start position:0%
National Forest they are studying uh
 
03:29:16.670 --> 03:29:16.680 align:start position:0%
what old growth is there and they're
 
03:29:18.269 --> 03:29:18.279 align:start position:0%
identifying and mapping it as we speak
 
03:29:19.469 --> 03:29:19.479 align:start position:0%
so I
 
03:29:21.469 --> 03:29:21.479 align:start position:0%
don't I don't I don't think that's a
 
03:29:23.830 --> 03:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
major problem for us to consider that as
 
03:29:23.840 --> 03:29:25.269 align:start position:0%
major problem for us to consider that as
public

03:29:25.269 --> 03:29:25.279 align:start position:0%
public
 
03:29:29.349 --> 03:29:29.359 align:start position:0%
land okay any other questions for the
 
03:29:32.349 --> 03:29:32.359 align:start position:0%
representative representative rung thank
 
03:29:33.950 --> 03:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
03:29:35.990 --> 03:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
question representative Kaplin are there
 
03:29:38.469 --> 03:29:38.479 align:start position:0%
other states that have doing this have
 
03:29:40.710 --> 03:29:40.720 align:start position:0%
you done any research about how many
 
03:29:42.030 --> 03:29:42.040 align:start position:0%
yeah I thanks for the question
 
03:29:43.670 --> 03:29:43.680 align:start position:0%
representative there are there all our
 
03:29:45.590 --> 03:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
neighboring states are are carrying out
 
03:29:48.150 --> 03:29:48.160 align:start position:0%
similar uh investigations into all
 
03:29:51.429 --> 03:29:51.439 align:start position:0%
growth and mature Forest uh got Maine
 
03:29:54.429 --> 03:29:54.439 align:start position:0%
Vermont New York state Pennsylvania I'm
 
03:29:56.309 --> 03:29:56.319 align:start position:0%
not sure about Massachusetts
 
03:29:59.870 --> 03:29:59.880 align:start position:0%
though representative Darby thank you Mr
 
03:30:01.670 --> 03:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
03:30:05.150 --> 03:30:05.160 align:start position:0%
can you um I didn't see the definitions
 
03:30:08.429 --> 03:30:08.439 align:start position:0%
of mature and old growth in the bill um
 
03:30:10.790 --> 03:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
and so do you think that those are sort
 
03:30:14.510 --> 03:30:14.520 align:start position:0%
of um obvious or do they should they be
 
03:30:16.229 --> 03:30:16.239 align:start position:0%
added should they be included as
 
03:30:19.550 --> 03:30:19.560 align:start position:0%
definitions to scope the
 
03:30:22.910 --> 03:30:22.920 align:start position:0%
surve I yeah I don't think that it's the
 
03:30:25.309 --> 03:30:25.319 align:start position:0%
place of the legislature to define those
 
03:30:26.990 --> 03:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
those questions I think that the
 
03:30:29.710 --> 03:30:29.720 align:start position:0%
department has the experts uh and the
 
03:30:31.870 --> 03:30:31.880 align:start position:0%
knowledge that they can identify what
 
03:30:33.870 --> 03:30:33.880 align:start position:0%
those definitions should be as I said in
 
03:30:35.870 --> 03:30:35.880 align:start position:0%
in my statements I think ideally that
 
03:30:37.389 --> 03:30:37.399 align:start position:0%
would be a public process that the
 
03:30:40.550 --> 03:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
public could be involved in um but I you
 
03:30:42.870 --> 03:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
know that that is the first step is to
 
03:30:45.189 --> 03:30:45.199 align:start position:0%
ID is to Define what those terms
 
03:30:47.189 --> 03:30:47.199 align:start position:0%
mean thank
 
03:30:49.830 --> 03:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
you representative L montain did you
 
03:30:52.389 --> 03:30:52.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:54.550 --> 03:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
question um I was just
 
03:30:56.670 --> 03:30:56.680 align:start position:0%
wondering about the job of
 
03:31:00.070 --> 03:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
identification and mapping um if there's
 
03:31:02.990 --> 03:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
another way we consider using other
 
03:31:05.389 --> 03:31:05.399 align:start position:0%
resources like not have the department
 
03:31:08.590 --> 03:31:08.600 align:start position:0%
do that but maybe contract with
 
03:31:11.950 --> 03:31:11.960 align:start position:0%
universities or use
 
03:31:16.070 --> 03:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
uh you know the resources of the uh
 
03:31:20.389 --> 03:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
Forest Service um and maybe you know
 
03:31:24.030 --> 03:31:24.040 align:start position:0%
consider rewarding this so that
 
03:31:27.309 --> 03:31:27.319 align:start position:0%
um um this agency or Department only has
 
03:31:29.429 --> 03:31:29.439 align:start position:0%
to compile the information rather than
 
03:31:31.429 --> 03:31:31.439 align:start position:0%
do it themselves yeah I mean that's a
 
03:31:32.670 --> 03:31:32.680 align:start position:0%
that's a great thought representative
 
03:31:34.910 --> 03:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for for asking that question
 
03:31:35.990 --> 03:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
and especially when I looked at the
 
03:31:37.710 --> 03:31:37.720 align:start position:0%
fiscal note that was my thought is that
 
03:31:39.389 --> 03:31:39.399 align:start position:0%
you know there's a lot of collaboration
 
03:31:42.070 --> 03:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
that is possible here to the cut costs
 
03:31:43.349 --> 03:31:43.359 align:start position:0%
and I I've been speaking to
 
03:31:44.910 --> 03:31:44.920 align:start position:0%
environmental Consultants who've been
 
03:31:47.630 --> 03:31:47.640 align:start position:0%
involved in this work and they mentioned
 
03:31:51.630 --> 03:31:51.640 align:start position:0%
that a great uh you know pool of uh
 
03:31:54.110 --> 03:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
potential mappers if you will are
 
03:31:55.469 --> 03:31:55.479 align:start position:0%
volunteers and getting the public
 
03:31:58.030 --> 03:31:58.040 align:start position:0%
involved in that and and this are these
 
03:32:00.150 --> 03:32:00.160 align:start position:0%
are uh you know projects that are
 
03:32:02.750 --> 03:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
already being done that use volunteer
 
03:32:05.510 --> 03:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
labor um to do the heavy work you know
 
03:32:06.950 --> 03:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
going out into the forest and and
 
03:32:09.990 --> 03:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
actually mapping what's there on foot so
 
03:32:12.189 --> 03:32:12.199 align:start position:0%
um yeah there's there's all all sorts of
 
03:32:13.750 --> 03:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
potential there it's it's beyond my
 
03:32:15.630 --> 03:32:15.640 align:start position:0%
expertise to be able to map that out but
 
03:32:17.990 --> 03:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
it's something that uh you know when
 
03:32:19.710 --> 03:32:19.720 align:start position:0%
looking at the fiscal note I would I
 
03:32:22.070 --> 03:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
would definitely want to know more about
 
03:32:24.229 --> 03:32:24.239 align:start position:0%
this you know potential
 
03:32:27.269 --> 03:32:27.279 align:start position:0%
collaborations before I accept it I mean
 
03:32:29.349 --> 03:32:29.359 align:start position:0%
I know in New Hampshire in in my town
 
03:32:31.349 --> 03:32:31.359 align:start position:0%
meetings for instance is always for
 
03:32:32.830 --> 03:32:32.840 align:start position:0%
instance the fire department is asking
 
03:32:35.030 --> 03:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
for the you know half a million dollar
 
03:32:36.830 --> 03:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
fir truck and and people push back and
 
03:32:38.590 --> 03:32:38.600 align:start position:0%
say well hold on a second do you really
 
03:32:40.189 --> 03:32:40.199 align:start position:0%
need that truck with all the bells and
 
03:32:42.229 --> 03:32:42.239 align:start position:0%
whistles can you find a you know a
 
03:32:45.910 --> 03:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
cheaper truck um so in this fiscal note
 
03:32:47.630 --> 03:32:47.640 align:start position:0%
I noticed that you know seven new
 
03:32:49.349 --> 03:32:49.359 align:start position:0%
employees being being sought by the
 
03:32:51.269 --> 03:32:51.279 align:start position:0%
department and and I don't be grudged on
 
03:32:53.469 --> 03:32:53.479 align:start position:0%
that but uh then I saw there's an every
 
03:32:55.309 --> 03:32:55.319 align:start position:0%
employee is getting a new vehicle and I
 
03:32:57.710 --> 03:32:57.720 align:start position:0%
was wondering you know dozens the the
 
03:32:59.269 --> 03:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
division of Forestry have vehicles
 
03:33:01.389 --> 03:33:01.399 align:start position:0%
already in place around the state do
 
03:33:03.269 --> 03:33:03.279 align:start position:0%
they each need a new vehicle so that's
 
03:33:06.150 --> 03:33:06.160 align:start position:0%
just you know um an exam I know that's
 
03:33:07.670 --> 03:33:07.680 align:start position:0%
the way things are done in New Hampshire
 
03:33:10.150 --> 03:33:10.160 align:start position:0%
but um I think that can be questioned
 
03:33:10.160 --> 03:33:12.630 align:start position:0%
but um I think that can be questioned
also

03:33:12.630 --> 03:33:12.640 align:start position:0%
also
 
03:33:14.590 --> 03:33:14.600 align:start position:0%
do you have a question representative
 
03:33:17.590 --> 03:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
wolf yes thank you are you aware that
 
03:33:21.990 --> 03:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
there is a division of Natural Resources
 
03:33:24.429 --> 03:33:24.439 align:start position:0%
within the department of that's doing
 
03:33:25.790 --> 03:33:25.800 align:start position:0%
this work
 
03:33:27.830 --> 03:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
now yes representative thank you for the
 
03:33:30.349 --> 03:33:30.359 align:start position:0%
question uh yes the division of Forestry
 
03:33:32.269 --> 03:33:32.279 align:start position:0%
is is a division within the department
 
03:33:34.429 --> 03:33:34.439 align:start position:0%
that carries on uh you know the work of
 
03:33:36.349 --> 03:33:36.359 align:start position:0%
is that who what you talking about I
 
03:33:39.269 --> 03:33:39.279 align:start position:0%
believe it's called the natural heritage
 
03:33:41.110 --> 03:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
there's a natural heritage Bureau as
 
03:33:44.030 --> 03:33:44.040 align:start position:0%
well that does mapping yeah they do uh
 
03:33:45.830 --> 03:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
similar work they're mapping uh what
 
03:33:47.710 --> 03:33:47.720 align:start position:0%
what are called exemplary communities
 
03:33:49.269 --> 03:33:49.279 align:start position:0%
which are kind of similar to Old grows
 
03:33:52.790 --> 03:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
but not exactly the same uh so it's um
 
03:33:54.309 --> 03:33:54.319 align:start position:0%
it's a little more restricted of a
 
03:33:57.469 --> 03:33:57.479 align:start position:0%
category and yeah I mean again that is
 
03:33:59.550 --> 03:33:59.560 align:start position:0%
an example of where collaboration even
 
03:34:01.670 --> 03:34:01.680 align:start position:0%
within the department might uh yield
 
03:34:03.830 --> 03:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
some results they've already identified
 
03:34:05.910 --> 03:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
and mapped some of the old Forest you're
 
03:34:08.590 --> 03:34:08.600 align:start position:0%
right um but there's a lot of work that
 
03:34:11.389 --> 03:34:11.399 align:start position:0%
still needs to be done
 
03:34:14.189 --> 03:34:14.199 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the
 
03:34:16.110 --> 03:34:16.120 align:start position:0%
representative seeing none thank you for
 
03:34:19.110 --> 03:34:19.120 align:start position:0%

to
 
03:35:00.070 --> 03:35:00.080 align:start position:0%
testify um I also submitted my testimony
 
03:35:01.870 --> 03:35:01.880 align:start position:0%
electronically just last night so it's
 
03:35:04.189 --> 03:35:04.199 align:start position:0%
in the queue um for the record my name
 
03:35:07.389 --> 03:35:07.399 align:start position:0%
is Patrick Hackley I the state Forester
 
03:35:08.710 --> 03:35:08.720 align:start position:0%
and director for the New Hampshire
 
03:35:11.469 --> 03:35:11.479 align:start position:0%
division of forest and lands one of five
 
03:35:12.750 --> 03:35:12.760 align:start position:0%
divisions under the Department of
 
03:35:17.469 --> 03:35:17.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:17.479 --> 03:35:20.150 align:start position:0%

03:35:20.150 --> 03:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
resources
 
03:35:24.550 --> 03:35:24.560 align:start position:0%
um so this bill is is uh asking the
 
03:35:25.550 --> 03:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
Department of Natural and cultural
 
03:35:27.150 --> 03:35:27.160 align:start position:0%
resource to identify an old growth
 
03:35:29.189 --> 03:35:29.199 align:start position:0%
mature force on public land in New
 
03:35:31.550 --> 03:35:31.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I just want to State also for
 
03:35:33.349 --> 03:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
the record that we do not have a formal
 
03:35:35.510 --> 03:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
position on this bill we just have some
 
03:35:37.790 --> 03:35:37.800 align:start position:0%
concerns we'd like to share with the
 
03:35:39.830 --> 03:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
committee under the authority of the New
 
03:35:41.670 --> 03:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire native plant protection act
 
03:35:41.680 --> 03:35:42.830 align:start position:0%

03:35:45.349 --> 03:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
217a our division's natural heritage
 
03:35:47.309 --> 03:35:47.319 align:start position:0%
Bureau identifies and facilitates the
 
03:35:48.950 --> 03:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
protection of the state's rare plants
 
03:35:50.830 --> 03:35:50.840 align:start position:0%
and exemplary natural
 
03:35:52.630 --> 03:35:52.640 align:start position:0%
communities um these are types of
 
03:35:54.269 --> 03:35:54.279 align:start position:0%
forests so that includes old growth and
 
03:35:57.790 --> 03:35:57.800 align:start position:0%
mature forests so
 
03:36:00.550 --> 03:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
um we I'll I'll get to the the
 
03:36:02.349 --> 03:36:02.359 align:start position:0%
definition in a in a moment because it
 
03:36:04.389 --> 03:36:04.399 align:start position:0%
is um something that there's a lot of
 
03:36:08.070 --> 03:36:08.080 align:start position:0%
debate about um so the bureau develops
 
03:36:09.750 --> 03:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
and implements measures for protection
 
03:36:11.269 --> 03:36:11.279 align:start position:0%
conservation and enhancement and
 
03:36:13.269 --> 03:36:13.279 align:start position:0%
management of native New Hampshire
 
03:36:15.630 --> 03:36:15.640 align:start position:0%
plants and natural communities and
 
03:36:17.189 --> 03:36:17.199 align:start position:0%
serves as an information source to
 
03:36:18.790 --> 03:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
assist and advise state and local
 
03:36:21.710 --> 03:36:21.720 align:start position:0%
agencies and the public uh the natural
 
03:36:24.750 --> 03:36:24.760 align:start position:0%
heritage Bureau is not a regulatory
 
03:36:26.870 --> 03:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
agency Instead The Bureau works with
 
03:36:28.510 --> 03:36:28.520 align:start position:0%
land owners and land managers to help
 
03:36:29.830 --> 03:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
them protect New Hampshire's native
 
03:36:32.189 --> 03:36:32.199 align:start position:0%
plants while meeting their land use
 
03:36:35.349 --> 03:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
needs as written HB
 
03:36:37.710 --> 03:36:37.720 align:start position:0%
1423 this bill would require us to
 
03:36:40.429 --> 03:36:40.439 align:start position:0%
identify dncr to identify old growth
 
03:36:43.510 --> 03:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
growth and mature forests on all all
 
03:36:45.150 --> 03:36:45.160 align:start position:0%
public lands in the
 
03:36:48.030 --> 03:36:48.040 align:start position:0%
state considering Municipal County state
 
03:36:49.550 --> 03:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
and federal ownership in in New
 
03:36:51.110 --> 03:36:51.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this would equate to well over
 
03:36:53.670 --> 03:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
1.5 million acres of
 
03:36:56.150 --> 03:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
land as indicated in the fiscal note the
 
03:36:57.750 --> 03:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
cost of hiring adequate staff to
 
03:36:59.150 --> 03:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
accomplish this task within any
 
03:37:02.150 --> 03:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
reasonable time period would be cost
 
03:37:04.150 --> 03:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
prohibitive secondly as I mentioned
 
03:37:06.269 --> 03:37:06.279 align:start position:0%
earlier old growth and mature Force have
 
03:37:08.469 --> 03:37:08.479 align:start position:0%
multiple and nuanced
 
03:37:10.950 --> 03:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
definitions um even among ologists and
 
03:37:12.710 --> 03:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
other natural resource professionals
 
03:37:15.429 --> 03:37:15.439 align:start position:0%
there are different definitions so that
 
03:37:17.550 --> 03:37:17.560 align:start position:0%
would have to be something that would
 
03:37:19.309 --> 03:37:19.319 align:start position:0%
would need to be Define before we could
 
03:37:22.229 --> 03:37:22.239 align:start position:0%
even commence any practical inventory of
 
03:37:24.990 --> 03:37:25.000 align:start position:0%
this particular natural
 
03:37:27.429 --> 03:37:27.439 align:start position:0%
Community um and lastly through the work
 
03:37:29.150 --> 03:37:29.160 align:start position:0%
of the natural heritage Bureau our
 
03:37:30.630 --> 03:37:30.640 align:start position:0%
agency is
 
03:37:35.110 --> 03:37:35.120 align:start position:0%
already um uh statutorily obligated if
 
03:37:36.790 --> 03:37:36.800 align:start position:0%
you will we're already in the process of
 
03:37:39.510 --> 03:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
identifying rare these rare communities
 
03:37:41.590 --> 03:37:41.600 align:start position:0%
all growth and natural natural um
 
03:37:43.349 --> 03:37:43.359 align:start position:0%
natural communities that have mature
 
03:37:45.550 --> 03:37:45.560 align:start position:0%
force in them so we're already meeting
 
03:37:48.790 --> 03:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
the state's obligation to inventory this
 
03:37:50.309 --> 03:37:50.319 align:start position:0%
particular type of
 
03:37:53.189 --> 03:37:53.199 align:start position:0%
forest um that's all I have um thank you
 
03:37:54.550 --> 03:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
for the opportunity to testify and I'd
 
03:37:56.790 --> 03:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
be happy to take any questions any
 
03:37:59.510 --> 03:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:03.070 --> 03:38:03.080 align:start position:0%
speaker representative rang thank you Mr
 
03:38:04.550 --> 03:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you Mr heckley for
 
03:38:07.309 --> 03:38:07.319 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I was alarmed too
 
03:38:10.950 --> 03:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
when I looked at the fiscal note um if
 
03:38:13.830 --> 03:38:13.840 align:start position:0%
the bill was amended to only incorporate
 
03:38:17.229 --> 03:38:17.239 align:start position:0%
state or maybe even national uh lands
 
03:38:20.830 --> 03:38:20.840 align:start position:0%
how would that impact the estimated
 
03:38:23.349 --> 03:38:23.359 align:start position:0%
cost we would probably need at least two
 
03:38:25.309 --> 03:38:25.319 align:start position:0%
or three more ecologists to help us with
 
03:38:28.229 --> 03:38:28.239 align:start position:0%
that task um the the White Mountain
 
03:38:30.269 --> 03:38:30.279 align:start position:0%
National Forest is mostly in New
 
03:38:32.070 --> 03:38:32.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but it also borders it it
 
03:38:35.469 --> 03:38:35.479 align:start position:0%
drips into the state of Maine about 780
 
03:38:38.630 --> 03:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
750,000 acres are in New Hampshire and
 
03:38:41.110 --> 03:38:41.120 align:start position:0%
then the rest uh White Mountain is in
 
03:38:43.710 --> 03:38:43.720 align:start position:0%
total a little under 900,000 Acres so it
 
03:38:46.110 --> 03:38:46.120 align:start position:0%
would still be quite a chunk if you just
 
03:38:50.269 --> 03:38:50.279 align:start position:0%
want to add State lands we have uh dncr
 
03:38:54.590 --> 03:38:54.600 align:start position:0%
reservations we have approximately
 
03:38:56.830 --> 03:38:56.840 align:start position:0%
um 200,000
 
03:38:59.590 --> 03:38:59.600 align:start position:0%
Acres as I mentioned before we already
 
03:39:02.510 --> 03:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
have identified a number of old growth
 
03:39:04.070 --> 03:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
components to those
 
03:39:07.710 --> 03:39:07.720 align:start position:0%
forests um but to get to your your
 
03:39:09.189 --> 03:39:09.199 align:start position:0%
question again representative Rong it
 
03:39:11.630 --> 03:39:11.640 align:start position:0%
would be probably a couple three
 
03:39:13.990 --> 03:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
ecologists anyway so you could maybe cut
 
03:39:17.990 --> 03:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
that number in half um but it still
 
03:39:20.750 --> 03:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
would be a large task and you still
 
03:39:22.389 --> 03:39:22.399 align:start position:0%
would need trucks you would still need
 
03:39:25.030 --> 03:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
to transport Personnel to these places
 
03:39:27.550 --> 03:39:27.560 align:start position:0%
we do have trucks uh in our division but
 
03:39:31.710 --> 03:39:31.720 align:start position:0%
they're already obligated to other
 
03:39:34.389 --> 03:39:34.399 align:start position:0%
responsibilities one follow so if you if
 
03:39:36.269 --> 03:39:36.279 align:start position:0%
you say that some of this work is being
 
03:39:39.389 --> 03:39:39.399 align:start position:0%
done already is the objective of the
 
03:39:41.189 --> 03:39:41.199 align:start position:0%
bill can that that be accomplished
 
03:39:43.670 --> 03:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
without legislation and if so what would
 
03:39:46.790 --> 03:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
the timeline of that
 
03:39:50.870 --> 03:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
be well I really I'm unclear as to the
 
03:39:53.070 --> 03:39:53.080 align:start position:0%
objective of the bill I think it it is
 
03:39:56.389 --> 03:39:56.399 align:start position:0%
requesting more inventory work
 
03:39:56.399 --> 03:39:58.229 align:start position:0%
requesting more inventory work
um

03:39:58.229 --> 03:39:58.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:00.630 --> 03:40:00.640 align:start position:0%
so we haven't given it a whole lot of
 
03:40:03.150 --> 03:40:03.160 align:start position:0%
thought because we looked at it at face
 
03:40:06.070 --> 03:40:06.080 align:start position:0%
value of what what it's currently asking
 
03:40:09.349 --> 03:40:09.359 align:start position:0%
us to do we haven't gone farther to say
 
03:40:11.070 --> 03:40:11.080 align:start position:0%
well if we you know we didn't feel like
 
03:40:12.510 --> 03:40:12.520 align:start position:0%
it was our role
 
03:40:15.189 --> 03:40:15.199 align:start position:0%
to try to meet the need since we feel
 
03:40:16.910 --> 03:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
like the division's already meeting the
 
03:40:16.920 --> 03:40:18.469 align:start position:0%
like the division's already meeting the
need

03:40:18.469 --> 03:40:18.479 align:start position:0%
need
 
03:40:21.269 --> 03:40:21.279 align:start position:0%
um it's it's an incremental
 
03:40:24.150 --> 03:40:24.160 align:start position:0%
process and it takes time and staff to
 
03:40:26.469 --> 03:40:26.479 align:start position:0%
do to do that on state
 
03:40:26.479 --> 03:40:28.070 align:start position:0%
do to do that on state
land

03:40:28.070 --> 03:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
land
 
03:40:28.080 --> 03:40:29.990 align:start position:0%
land
um

03:40:29.990 --> 03:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:32.349 --> 03:40:32.359 align:start position:0%
so you know I I really haven't given
 
03:40:34.150 --> 03:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
much thought about how would we
 
03:40:36.389 --> 03:40:36.399 align:start position:0%
calibrate the the time period to get the
 
03:40:39.710 --> 03:40:39.720 align:start position:0%
job done okay thank you any other
 
03:40:39.720 --> 03:40:42.269 align:start position:0%
job done okay thank you any other
questions

03:40:42.269 --> 03:40:42.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:46.070 --> 03:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
yes representative um thank you Mr chair
 
03:40:48.870 --> 03:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I'm confused maybe I think I
 
03:40:51.630 --> 03:40:51.640 align:start position:0%
just misheard the question if the state
 
03:40:54.710 --> 03:40:54.720 align:start position:0%
is already um inventorying the state
 
03:40:57.590 --> 03:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
lands and this bill were scoped to State
 
03:40:59.870 --> 03:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
and and this bill were scoped to State
 
03:41:02.269 --> 03:41:02.279 align:start position:0%
lands it would still require two or
 
03:41:04.910 --> 03:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
three additional headcount yeah because
 
03:41:06.550 --> 03:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
our current natural heritage Bureau
 
03:41:08.229 --> 03:41:08.239 align:start position:0%
staff are already obligated to other
 
03:41:10.830 --> 03:41:10.840 align:start position:0%
tasks that they carry out so so we would
 
03:41:13.710 --> 03:41:13.720 align:start position:0%
need to have dedicated staff just to go
 
03:41:17.150 --> 03:41:17.160 align:start position:0%
out and inventory all those 200,000
 
03:41:18.990 --> 03:41:19.000 align:start position:0%
acres to see if you
 
03:41:21.510 --> 03:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
know where all growth first we'd have to
 
03:41:22.950 --> 03:41:22.960 align:start position:0%
come up with the definition and then we
 
03:41:25.710 --> 03:41:25.720 align:start position:0%
would probably need to dedicate uh staff
 
03:41:27.950 --> 03:41:27.960 align:start position:0%
specifically to that task across the
 
03:41:29.510 --> 03:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
state so there would be an additional
 
03:41:31.990 --> 03:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
need for staff thank
 
03:41:35.389 --> 03:41:35.399 align:start position:0%
you any other
 
03:41:37.189 --> 03:41:37.199 align:start position:0%
questions well thank you for your
 
03:41:39.030 --> 03:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
testimony okay thank
 
03:41:39.040 --> 03:41:41.149 align:start position:0%
testimony okay thank
you

03:41:41.149 --> 03:41:41.159 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:41:48.349 --> 03:41:48.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:55.710 --> 03:41:55.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:03.590 --> 03:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:06.469 --> 03:42:06.479 align:start position:0%
director is this on okay sorry about
 
03:42:09.710 --> 03:42:09.720 align:start position:0%
that so um I'm Matt Ley public policy
 
03:42:11.510 --> 03:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
director dor for the society for the
 
03:42:14.349 --> 03:42:14.359 align:start position:0%
protection of New Hampshire Forest um
 
03:42:18.910 --> 03:42:18.920 align:start position:0%
and we are a nonprofit Land Trust um our
 
03:42:22.149 --> 03:42:22.159 align:start position:0%
basic mission is to protect and preserve
 
03:42:23.630 --> 03:42:23.640 align:start position:0%
U the forest in New
 
03:42:27.110 --> 03:42:27.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh we do that two ways one by
 
03:42:29.870 --> 03:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
actually owning and acquiring Forest
 
03:42:33.910 --> 03:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
land we also um also hold easements on
 
03:42:36.670 --> 03:42:36.680 align:start position:0%
on other privately held land so we
 
03:42:40.030 --> 03:42:40.040 align:start position:0%
currently we own about 60,000 Acres of
 
03:42:43.070 --> 03:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
mostly forested land in New Hampshire so
 
03:42:46.030 --> 03:42:46.040 align:start position:0%
this you know very big part of our
 
03:42:46.040 --> 03:42:48.870 align:start position:0%
this you know very big part of our
mission

03:42:48.870 --> 03:42:48.880 align:start position:0%
mission
 
03:42:53.469 --> 03:42:53.479 align:start position:0%
um you know and you know typically we do
 
03:42:56.550 --> 03:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
it you know advocate for
 
03:42:59.189 --> 03:42:59.199 align:start position:0%
additional resources for you know
 
03:43:01.110 --> 03:43:01.120 align:start position:0%
funding and resources for our public
 
03:43:03.670 --> 03:43:03.680 align:start position:0%
resource agencies like forest and lands
 
03:43:07.269 --> 03:43:07.279 align:start position:0%
fishing game um and we certainly
 
03:43:09.429 --> 03:43:09.439 align:start position:0%
consider you know both those agencies
 
03:43:12.790 --> 03:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
our you know our partners on this
 
03:43:15.389 --> 03:43:15.399 align:start position:0%
um but and this has been mentioned
 
03:43:17.950 --> 03:43:17.960 align:start position:0%
already you know when we saw the fiscal
 
03:43:21.590 --> 03:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
note it is actually is a concern for us
 
03:43:25.149 --> 03:43:25.159 align:start position:0%
um in the scope of work currently called
 
03:43:27.670 --> 03:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
for in the bill you know does seem
 
03:43:32.030 --> 03:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
daunting quite frankly um
 
03:43:34.870 --> 03:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
and you know the the there is a number
 
03:43:37.590 --> 03:43:37.600 align:start position:0%
of challenges and issues and concerns
 
03:43:39.269 --> 03:43:39.279 align:start position:0%
that are facing the forest in New
 
03:43:42.550 --> 03:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire currently um and one uh
 
03:43:45.830 --> 03:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
suggestion perhaps I would um pass along
 
03:43:48.790 --> 03:43:48.800 align:start position:0%
to the committee is to review the
 
03:43:52.110 --> 03:43:52.120 align:start position:0%
state's Forest action plan um which was
 
03:43:55.750 --> 03:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
developed um by Patrick's office back in
 
03:43:59.030 --> 03:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
20120 and it is um a very
 
03:44:03.389 --> 03:44:03.399 align:start position:0%
extensive document but it lays out you
 
03:44:07.149 --> 03:44:07.159 align:start position:0%
know the um all the
 
03:44:11.030 --> 03:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
issues Trends concern that are facing
 
03:44:13.149 --> 03:44:13.159 align:start position:0%
the forest and there are a lot I mean
 
03:44:16.070 --> 03:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
there's we have invasive pests and
 
03:44:19.469 --> 03:44:19.479 align:start position:0%
species um climate change is certainly
 
03:44:23.950 --> 03:44:23.960 align:start position:0%
an issue um and and how do we um make
 
03:44:25.790 --> 03:44:25.800 align:start position:0%
sure our forest and not just public
 
03:44:27.830 --> 03:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
Forest you know private you know
 
03:44:31.030 --> 03:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
privately owned Forest too um are able
 
03:44:33.030 --> 03:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
to you know
 
03:44:35.950 --> 03:44:35.960 align:start position:0%
withstand these changes we may be seeing
 
03:44:37.910 --> 03:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
because of climate change but then there
 
03:44:41.790 --> 03:44:41.800 align:start position:0%
are other issues um you know markets for
 
03:44:43.630 --> 03:44:43.640 align:start position:0%
the wood that's harvested in New
 
03:44:45.670 --> 03:44:45.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you know how do we you know
 
03:44:48.750 --> 03:44:48.760 align:start position:0%
make sure um there are those markets and
 
03:44:51.429 --> 03:44:51.439 align:start position:0%
representative harb actually chaired a
 
03:44:54.110 --> 03:44:54.120 align:start position:0%
commission um on lowgrade wood and we
 
03:44:56.910 --> 03:44:56.920 align:start position:0%
certainly appreciate that work um and
 
03:44:59.149 --> 03:44:59.159 align:start position:0%
hopefully there'll be you know some real
 
03:45:01.030 --> 03:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
action items that'll come out of the
 
03:45:04.710 --> 03:45:04.720 align:start position:0%
work you did there so um you know that's
 
03:45:06.510 --> 03:45:06.520 align:start position:0%
really Our concern there's so much going
 
03:45:09.429 --> 03:45:09.439 align:start position:0%
on in our forest right now and you know
 
03:45:11.269 --> 03:45:11.279 align:start position:0%
can't and you know we understand you
 
03:45:14.830 --> 03:45:14.840 align:start position:0%
know the um budget pressures you know
 
03:45:18.070 --> 03:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
facing the state and so you know given
 
03:45:21.070 --> 03:45:21.080 align:start position:0%
all that's going on you know you know is
 
03:45:24.269 --> 03:45:24.279 align:start position:0%
there room and capacity you know with um
 
03:45:26.110 --> 03:45:26.120 align:start position:0%
the division of forest lands to also
 
03:45:28.469 --> 03:45:28.479 align:start position:0%
undertake like I said what does seem to
 
03:45:32.590 --> 03:45:32.600 align:start position:0%
be a a daunting scope of work so I'll
 
03:45:34.710 --> 03:45:34.720 align:start position:0%
just but I have to take any
 
03:45:37.830 --> 03:45:37.840 align:start position:0%
questions any other questions for our
 
03:45:39.790 --> 03:45:39.800 align:start position:0%
speaker seeing none thank you thank you
 
03:45:41.469 --> 03:45:41.479 align:start position:0%
for your
 
03:45:43.670 --> 03:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
testimony speaking in support of the
 
03:45:53.269 --> 03:45:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:57.750 --> 03:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
Club good afternoon uh thank you for um
 
03:45:58.950 --> 03:45:58.960 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
03:46:02.750 --> 03:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
testimony my name is Katherine cork I am
 
03:46:05.710 --> 03:46:05.720 align:start position:0%
with New Hampshire Sierra Club uh the
 
03:46:08.870 --> 03:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
Sierra Club is an environmental advocacy
 
03:46:11.469 --> 03:46:11.479 align:start position:0%
group and
 
03:46:15.070 --> 03:46:15.080 align:start position:0%
um we support this bill uh because we
 
03:46:19.469 --> 03:46:19.479 align:start position:0%
were hoping to have some space not uh to
 
03:46:22.349 --> 03:46:22.359 align:start position:0%
to talk about mature forests to talk
 
03:46:27.990 --> 03:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
about old growth forests and um to
 
03:46:30.550 --> 03:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
partner with our federal
 
03:46:35.110 --> 03:46:35.120 align:start position:0%
agencies uh that are doing this work
 
03:46:35.120 --> 03:46:37.469 align:start position:0%
agencies uh that are doing this work
um

03:46:37.469 --> 03:46:37.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:40.389 --> 03:46:40.399 align:start position:0%
and in particular
 
03:46:43.469 --> 03:46:43.479 align:start position:0%
um have a space where we're not talking
 
03:46:48.790 --> 03:46:48.800 align:start position:0%
about logging these large trees um and
 
03:46:52.149 --> 03:46:52.159 align:start position:0%
to think of the many other uses and
 
03:46:56.590 --> 03:46:56.600 align:start position:0%
benefits that we get from mature
 
03:46:56.600 --> 03:46:58.349 align:start position:0%
benefits that we get from mature
forests

03:46:58.349 --> 03:46:58.359 align:start position:0%
forests
 
03:47:01.710 --> 03:47:01.720 align:start position:0%
um it so often when we talk about
 
03:47:04.590 --> 03:47:04.600 align:start position:0%
forests in New Hampshire we hear from
 
03:47:08.510 --> 03:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
the logging industry and the markets and
 
03:47:13.750 --> 03:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
the that's great and you know there's a
 
03:47:16.710 --> 03:47:16.720 align:start position:0%
time for that but we're hoping to really
 
03:47:21.469 --> 03:47:21.479 align:start position:0%
focus in on the place of our old growth
 
03:47:23.870 --> 03:47:23.880 align:start position:0%
and the natural
 
03:47:28.630 --> 03:47:28.640 align:start position:0%
exemplary um forest in New Hampshire on
 
03:47:32.670 --> 03:47:32.680 align:start position:0%
our public lands um and I have a
 
03:47:35.149 --> 03:47:35.159 align:start position:0%
testimony uh from folks who couldn't be
 
03:47:40.429 --> 03:47:40.439 align:start position:0%
here today um uh one from uh
 
03:47:43.710 --> 03:47:43.720 align:start position:0%
Zack Porter from standing trees he
 
03:47:48.070 --> 03:47:48.080 align:start position:0%
wasn't able to make it today and um if
 
03:47:50.750 --> 03:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
this bill does go into a study committee
 
03:47:54.429 --> 03:47:54.439 align:start position:0%
I I really encourage you to uh include
 
03:47:57.910 --> 03:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
him he's he is quite the expert on on
 
03:48:02.630 --> 03:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
these issues um and uh also from our
 
03:48:05.630 --> 03:48:05.640 align:start position:0%
Chapter Chair uh Jerry
 
03:48:05.640 --> 03:48:07.710 align:start position:0%
Chapter Chair uh Jerry
Curran

03:48:07.710 --> 03:48:07.720 align:start position:0%
Curran
 
03:48:09.990 --> 03:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
um specifically
 
03:48:12.510 --> 03:48:12.520 align:start position:0%
I I hear um I think it was
 
03:48:15.110 --> 03:48:15.120 align:start position:0%
representative wolf who talked about all
 
03:48:18.110 --> 03:48:18.120 align:start position:0%
public lands and the task of of that
 
03:48:21.309 --> 03:48:21.319 align:start position:0%
that might be I think there's room
 
03:48:26.349 --> 03:48:26.359 align:start position:0%
around that in this bill um and maybe
 
03:48:30.030 --> 03:48:30.040 align:start position:0%
it's unreasonable to ask a state agency
 
03:48:35.630 --> 03:48:35.640 align:start position:0%
to uh head up the inventory of federal
 
03:48:39.950 --> 03:48:39.960 align:start position:0%
lands I I I think that's probably
 
03:48:44.990 --> 03:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
reasonable um and asking them to also
 
03:48:48.469 --> 03:48:48.479 align:start position:0%
inventory Community or or town
 
03:48:53.189 --> 03:48:53.199 align:start position:0%
lands um I I am definitely uh supportive
 
03:48:56.550 --> 03:48:56.560 align:start position:0%
of maybe having a little bit more Focus
 
03:49:01.030 --> 03:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh on the 200,000 Acres of the state and
 
03:49:02.389 --> 03:49:02.399 align:start position:0%
and let
 
03:49:06.149 --> 03:49:06.159 align:start position:0%
me just support the work that the state
 
03:49:10.750 --> 03:49:10.760 align:start position:0%
has been doing on this um having
 
03:49:15.870 --> 03:49:15.880 align:start position:0%
identified some of our exemplary natural
 
03:49:20.229 --> 03:49:20.239 align:start position:0%
Forest um in the state is is excellent
 
03:49:23.550 --> 03:49:23.560 align:start position:0%
um but there's more work to be done and
 
03:49:25.149 --> 03:49:25.159 align:start position:0%
and to
 
03:49:29.309 --> 03:49:29.319 align:start position:0%
prioritize that work is really what this
 
03:49:33.349 --> 03:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
bill is I think is trying to do um as I
 
03:49:35.790 --> 03:49:35.800 align:start position:0%
read it
 
03:49:40.790 --> 03:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
um so with that um I'm happy to take any
 
03:49:44.349 --> 03:49:44.359 align:start position:0%
questions and encourage you all to look
 
03:49:47.670 --> 03:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
deeply into this bill and and find a way
 
03:49:51.670 --> 03:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
to support the identification and
 
03:49:55.870 --> 03:49:55.880 align:start position:0%
inventorying of the natural exemplary
 
03:49:58.630 --> 03:49:58.640 align:start position:0%
forest in the state or old growth forest
 
03:50:02.790 --> 03:50:02.800 align:start position:0%
in the state thank you any questions
 
03:50:06.590 --> 03:50:06.600 align:start position:0%
representative Iran thank you Mr chair
 
03:50:10.149 --> 03:50:10.159 align:start position:0%
it's not common that we see um the New
 
03:50:12.110 --> 03:50:12.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Sierra Club and the society
 
03:50:13.389 --> 03:50:13.399 align:start position:0%
for the protection of New Hampshire
 
03:50:16.750 --> 03:50:16.760 align:start position:0%
Forest coming in with different um
 
03:50:20.229 --> 03:50:20.239 align:start position:0%
positions on a bill so I I guess I want
 
03:50:22.149 --> 03:50:22.159 align:start position:0%
Clarity on where the New Hampshire
 
03:50:26.149 --> 03:50:26.159 align:start position:0%
Sierra Club stands are is your um
 
03:50:28.710 --> 03:50:28.720 align:start position:0%
support for this bill mainly because of
 
03:50:31.870 --> 03:50:31.880 align:start position:0%
you want protection for the old growth
 
03:50:35.510 --> 03:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
forests and um what do you cons would
 
03:50:38.309 --> 03:50:38.319 align:start position:0%
you consider that suggestion by Mr Ley
 
03:50:40.750 --> 03:50:40.760 align:start position:0%
about reviewing the States forested
 
03:50:44.030 --> 03:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
action plan to see if um this type of
 
03:50:46.590 --> 03:50:46.600 align:start position:0%
inventory or this type of work can be
 
03:50:48.950 --> 03:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
integrated in with with
 
03:50:52.110 --> 03:50:52.120 align:start position:0%
that um I'm not sure if he testified to
 
03:50:57.070 --> 03:50:57.080 align:start position:0%
that but um I I know we
 
03:51:00.790 --> 03:51:00.800 align:start position:0%
are there's a real opportunity um with
 
03:51:03.429 --> 03:51:03.439 align:start position:0%
the federal government is actually doing
 
03:51:06.110 --> 03:51:06.120 align:start position:0%
this on federal lands and this could be
 
03:51:09.189 --> 03:51:09.199 align:start position:0%
a real bridge for the state to collect
 
03:51:11.269 --> 03:51:11.279 align:start position:0%
collaborate with that
 
03:51:14.950 --> 03:51:14.960 align:start position:0%
expertise um Beyond The White Mountain
 
03:51:19.349 --> 03:51:19.359 align:start position:0%
National Forest um as for the State uh
 
03:51:22.149 --> 03:51:22.159 align:start position:0%
forestry action plan that's that's
 
03:51:28.110 --> 03:51:28.120 align:start position:0%
really focused on on a harvesting um I I
 
03:51:34.070 --> 03:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
would be loathe to uh add to the list of
 
03:51:37.229 --> 03:51:37.239 align:start position:0%
activities of the forest reaction plan
 
03:51:40.870 --> 03:51:40.880 align:start position:0%
uh because it is is it is pretty massive
 
03:51:44.590 --> 03:51:44.600 align:start position:0%
um but it's I
 
03:51:48.630 --> 03:51:48.640 align:start position:0%
guess I feel as though there isn't a lot
 
03:51:51.910 --> 03:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
of space for for mature
 
03:51:56.349 --> 03:51:56.359 align:start position:0%
forests um in in those areas and so
 
03:51:56.359 --> 03:51:57.349 align:start position:0%
forests um in in those areas and so
maybe

03:51:57.349 --> 03:51:57.359 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
03:52:01.830 --> 03:52:01.840 align:start position:0%
designating some other space for mature
 
03:52:07.670 --> 03:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
Forest um that this this bill might be
 
03:52:10.630 --> 03:52:10.640 align:start position:0%
doing any other questions for the
 
03:52:20.550 --> 03:52:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:25.870 --> 03:52:25.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:25.880 --> 03:52:38.030 align:start position:0%
 
each

03:52:38.030 --> 03:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:38.040 --> 03:52:44.550 align:start position:0%
 
thank

03:52:44.550 --> 03:52:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:47.510 --> 03:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
our next speaker Jason stock
 
03:52:50.830 --> 03:52:50.840 align:start position:0%
Jason New Hampshire Timberland Owners
 
03:52:55.149 --> 03:52:55.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:58.349 --> 03:52:58.359 align:start position:0%
bill oh good afternoon U I'm going to
 
03:53:00.830 --> 03:53:00.840 align:start position:0%
try to be brief um I know you've had a
 
03:53:02.990 --> 03:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
very long morning but I appreciate the
 
03:53:04.910 --> 03:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity to come and testify for the
 
03:53:07.429 --> 03:53:07.439 align:start position:0%
record I'm Jason stock I'm the executive
 
03:53:08.710 --> 03:53:08.720 align:start position:0%
director of the New Hampshire Timberland
 
03:53:08.720 --> 03:53:10.110 align:start position:0%
director of the New Hampshire Timberland
owner

03:53:10.110 --> 03:53:10.120 align:start position:0%
owner
 
03:53:14.469 --> 03:53:14.479 align:start position:0%
Association and uh our members represent
 
03:53:16.550 --> 03:53:16.560 align:start position:0%
we represent Timberland owners as well
 
03:53:18.670 --> 03:53:18.680 align:start position:0%
as folks that work in the forest and
 
03:53:22.110 --> 03:53:22.120 align:start position:0%
process Forest products and for many of
 
03:53:24.030 --> 03:53:24.040 align:start position:0%
the reasons you heard from the forest
 
03:53:27.030 --> 03:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
Society we oppose this bill um kind of
 
03:53:30.070 --> 03:53:30.080 align:start position:0%
put things in context you heard 1.5
 
03:53:32.590 --> 03:53:32.600 align:start position:0%
million Acres of public land the state
 
03:53:35.229 --> 03:53:35.239 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire is 5 million Acres
 
03:53:37.950 --> 03:53:37.960 align:start position:0%
roughly so to to ask the division of
 
03:53:39.670 --> 03:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
forest and land
 
03:53:43.670 --> 03:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
to to inventory and map one point
 
03:53:46.710 --> 03:53:46.720 align:start position:0%
basically a third of the state for one
 
03:53:50.149 --> 03:53:50.159 align:start position:0%
specific element is a pretty tall
 
03:53:53.830 --> 03:53:53.840 align:start position:0%
order moreover mapping inventorying and
 
03:53:56.750 --> 03:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
mapping it's not like you can just
 
03:54:00.070 --> 03:54:00.080 align:start position:0%
Google Earth it and say all right that
 
03:54:02.670 --> 03:54:02.680 align:start position:0%
looks old that doesn't you actually have
 
03:54:04.910 --> 03:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
to get out there and have boots on the
 
03:54:06.710 --> 03:54:06.720 align:start position:0%
ground so when you look at the fiscal
 
03:54:10.469 --> 03:54:10.479 align:start position:0%
note think about hiring someone to go
 
03:54:13.910 --> 03:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
out or many someone's to go out and
 
03:54:16.990 --> 03:54:17.000 align:start position:0%
actually Cruise a third of the state
 
03:54:20.269 --> 03:54:20.279 align:start position:0%
looking for old growth
 
03:54:23.990 --> 03:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
characteristics document that and then
 
03:54:28.910 --> 03:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
get your GPS points map it load it into
 
03:54:31.910 --> 03:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
whatever software you use it's a pretty
 
03:54:34.630 --> 03:54:34.640 align:start position:0%
big task so although you may say well
 
03:54:36.870 --> 03:54:36.880 align:start position:0%
it's just map it and inventory and it
 
03:54:39.429 --> 03:54:39.439 align:start position:0%
that's that's simple enough it's a lot
 
03:54:42.790 --> 03:54:42.800 align:start position:0%
of land uh 1.5 about a third of the
 
03:54:46.710 --> 03:54:46.720 align:start position:0%
state and as as Mr Ley had testified
 
03:54:49.389 --> 03:54:49.399 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of other challenges
 
03:54:52.189 --> 03:54:52.199 align:start position:0%
facing the state the state at least on
 
03:54:55.389 --> 03:54:55.399 align:start position:0%
state land they have they they as you
 
03:54:58.070 --> 03:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
heard they know where the old growth is
 
03:54:59.870 --> 03:54:59.880 align:start position:0%
and where those characteristics are on
 
03:55:02.830 --> 03:55:02.840 align:start position:0%
their property to ask them to go to a
 
03:55:06.269 --> 03:55:06.279 align:start position:0%
county the Army Corps of engineer lands
 
03:55:09.189 --> 03:55:09.199 align:start position:0%
the US fish and wildlife service and
 
03:55:11.950 --> 03:55:11.960 align:start position:0%
let's not forget Town Forest and say
 
03:55:15.349 --> 03:55:15.359 align:start position:0%
okay we want you to start cruising those
 
03:55:18.070 --> 03:55:18.080 align:start position:0%
and mapping that again that's a pretty
 
03:55:22.030 --> 03:55:22.040 align:start position:0%
big task and so I think the suggestion
 
03:55:25.389 --> 03:55:25.399 align:start position:0%
to to look at the forest action plan it
 
03:55:26.990 --> 03:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
is more than just about Timber
 
03:55:28.910 --> 03:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
harvesting there are chapters in there
 
03:55:31.189 --> 03:55:31.199 align:start position:0%
about carbon there are chapters in there
 
03:55:35.349 --> 03:55:35.359 align:start position:0%
about rare rare ecological systems it is
 
03:55:37.830 --> 03:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
it is incredibly comprehensive very
 
03:55:41.950 --> 03:55:41.960 align:start position:0%
large very dense document if that is
 
03:55:46.469 --> 03:55:46.479 align:start position:0%
where this this really should reside and
 
03:55:49.269 --> 03:55:49.279 align:start position:0%
and that's where the charge should be
 
03:55:51.990 --> 03:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
that comes up periodically for review
 
03:55:53.670 --> 03:55:53.680 align:start position:0%
and that's where the division of forest
 
03:55:55.349 --> 03:55:55.359 align:start position:0%
and Lance that's think of it as their
 
03:55:57.070 --> 03:55:57.080 align:start position:0%
kind of their strategic plan for the
 
03:55:59.429 --> 03:55:59.439 align:start position:0%
state's forest and that's really where
 
03:56:02.750 --> 03:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
this this should be this task should be
 
03:56:05.550 --> 03:56:05.560 align:start position:0%
vetted and and inserted with that I'll
 
03:56:07.349 --> 03:56:07.359 align:start position:0%
conclude my testimony I'd be happy to
 
03:56:09.229 --> 03:56:09.239 align:start position:0%
try to answer any questions
 
03:56:12.189 --> 03:56:12.199 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions for the
 
03:56:15.630 --> 03:56:15.640 align:start position:0%
speaker Mr D representative
 
03:56:18.550 --> 03:56:18.560 align:start position:0%
Derby representative R Mr chair thank
 
03:56:20.030 --> 03:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question certainly I
 
03:56:21.389 --> 03:56:21.399 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure I understand the
 
03:56:26.070 --> 03:56:26.080 align:start position:0%
op um the concern um of the U the New
 
03:56:28.070 --> 03:56:28.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Timberland Owners Association
 
03:56:30.990 --> 03:56:31.000 align:start position:0%
are you concerned that um the state is
 
03:56:33.710 --> 03:56:33.720 align:start position:0%
going to it's going to cost uh State too
 
03:56:35.750 --> 03:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
much money to do this or is there some
 
03:56:38.429 --> 03:56:38.439 align:start position:0%
other concern that is underlying your
 
03:56:38.439 --> 03:56:39.510 align:start position:0%
other concern that is underlying your
your

03:56:39.510 --> 03:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
your
 
03:56:42.870 --> 03:56:42.880 align:start position:0%
great question concern is twofold one
 
03:56:45.990 --> 03:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
this is not the appropriate venue to be
 
03:56:48.229 --> 03:56:48.239 align:start position:0%
the forest action plan we feel is really
 
03:56:50.349 --> 03:56:50.359 align:start position:0%
the approp that strategic plan for the
 
03:56:52.309 --> 03:56:52.319 align:start position:0%
state's Forest that's really the
 
03:56:55.030 --> 03:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate venue to be mapping out task
 
03:56:58.790 --> 03:56:58.800 align:start position:0%
like this but secondly as as the fiscal
 
03:57:01.510 --> 03:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
note indicates it's a it's a large
 
03:57:04.510 --> 03:57:04.520 align:start position:0%
expense and it is a a large expense
 
03:57:07.269 --> 03:57:07.279 align:start position:0%
imposed on an agency that has many other
 
03:57:11.229 --> 03:57:11.239 align:start position:0%
tasks and so unless the unless the state
 
03:57:13.429 --> 03:57:13.439 align:start position:0%
dips into the coffers and says yes we're
 
03:57:15.750 --> 03:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
going to fully fund this and we're
 
03:57:18.630 --> 03:57:18.640 align:start position:0%
really going to put the resources on it
 
03:57:22.630 --> 03:57:22.640 align:start position:0%
other areas Forest Health and other
 
03:57:25.149 --> 03:57:25.159 align:start position:0%
areas will suffer and that's really a
 
03:57:28.389 --> 03:57:28.399 align:start position:0%
concern that we have is that and
 
03:57:31.110 --> 03:57:31.120 align:start position:0%
moreover to ask them to do that on land
 
03:57:34.189 --> 03:57:34.199 align:start position:0%
that they do not control Town Forest
 
03:57:37.189 --> 03:57:37.199 align:start position:0%
County forest Etc we think it's just
 
03:57:39.950 --> 03:57:39.960 align:start position:0%
inappropriate you're welcome welcome
 
03:57:42.590 --> 03:57:42.600 align:start position:0%
representative renz
 
03:57:44.950 --> 03:57:44.960 align:start position:0%
Zulo thank you and thank you for taking
 
03:57:48.070 --> 03:57:48.080 align:start position:0%
my question this might uh well this
 
03:57:50.189 --> 03:57:50.199 align:start position:0%
question might be posed to just about
 
03:57:53.590 --> 03:57:53.600 align:start position:0%
everyone who who spoke spoken my concern
 
03:57:54.870 --> 03:57:54.880 align:start position:0%
is about the
 
03:57:58.630 --> 03:57:58.640 align:start position:0%
security of these valuable resources and
 
03:57:58.640 --> 03:57:59.990 align:start position:0%
security of these valuable resources and
historic

03:57:59.990 --> 03:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
historic
 
03:58:06.070 --> 03:58:06.080 align:start position:0%
resources uh is is with this is this
 
03:58:10.229 --> 03:58:10.239 align:start position:0%
information going to be sequestered a
 
03:58:13.550 --> 03:58:13.560 align:start position:0%
hell at least a some kind of
 
03:58:16.870 --> 03:58:16.880 align:start position:0%
confidentiality because I could Vision
 
03:58:20.269 --> 03:58:20.279 align:start position:0%
Vision know just any old person deciding
 
03:58:23.590 --> 03:58:23.600 align:start position:0%
hey let's go to this real Old Forest and
 
03:58:27.149 --> 03:58:27.159 align:start position:0%
maybe we can do a few cuttings uh I mean
 
03:58:30.469 --> 03:58:30.479 align:start position:0%
sure people are like that well is there
 
03:58:32.750 --> 03:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
any thought on security the in the
 
03:58:34.630 --> 03:58:34.640 align:start position:0%
protection of these sure this
 
03:58:37.870 --> 03:58:37.880 align:start position:0%
information sure good question first off
 
03:58:41.630 --> 03:58:41.640 align:start position:0%
this is information on public lands so
 
03:58:44.189 --> 03:58:44.199 align:start position:0%
it's not private lands so this is public
 
03:58:47.469 --> 03:58:47.479 align:start position:0%
lands so if someone were to say ah I got
 
03:58:50.910 --> 03:58:50.920 align:start position:0%
a map of Old growth let's go let's go
 
03:58:54.550 --> 03:58:54.560 align:start position:0%
log it that's not GNA I mean that that
 
03:58:56.149 --> 03:58:56.159 align:start position:0%
that brings in all kinds of other
 
03:58:59.590 --> 03:58:59.600 align:start position:0%
violations and so my cuting I me my
 
03:59:03.830 --> 03:59:03.840 align:start position:0%
cting I me so so I think I think the the
 
03:59:05.870 --> 03:59:05.880 align:start position:0%
point is is that from a security
 
03:59:07.389 --> 03:59:07.399 align:start position:0%
standpoint these are lands that are
 
03:59:09.070 --> 03:59:09.080 align:start position:0%
managed by professional
 
03:59:11.229 --> 03:59:11.239 align:start position:0%
public Foresters and so there's a
 
03:59:13.510 --> 03:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
there's a level of security there
 
03:59:15.550 --> 03:59:15.560 align:start position:0%
there's a level there's a level of
 
03:59:18.269 --> 03:59:18.279 align:start position:0%
regulations and laws that protect even
 
03:59:20.510 --> 03:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
tree trimming you can't you can't
 
03:59:22.550 --> 03:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
legally go on and start trimming trees
 
03:59:25.750 --> 03:59:25.760 align:start position:0%
on someone else's land even public land
 
03:59:28.389 --> 03:59:28.399 align:start position:0%
and that in fact violates the law so
 
03:59:31.309 --> 03:59:31.319 align:start position:0%
there's also another level of of
 
03:59:34.349 --> 03:59:34.359 align:start position:0%
regulatory um legal Authority there to
 
03:59:37.550 --> 03:59:37.560 align:start position:0%
protect this protect this resource so I
 
03:59:41.870 --> 03:59:41.880 align:start position:0%
think I'm not as concerned about that um
 
03:59:43.429 --> 03:59:43.439 align:start position:0%
you know I think the security question
 
03:59:45.870 --> 03:59:45.880 align:start position:0%
is answered already with the way these
 
03:59:49.149 --> 03:59:49.159 align:start position:0%
lands are owned managed and our current
 
03:59:54.349 --> 03:59:54.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:56.830 --> 03:59:56.840 align:start position:0%
infrastructure representative of
 
03:59:59.590 --> 03:59:59.600 align:start position:0%
B thank you Mr chair um thank you Mr
 
04:00:02.630 --> 04:00:02.640 align:start position:0%
stock for uh taking my question I just
 
04:00:05.630 --> 04:00:05.640 align:start position:0%
um quickly do you have a definition of
 
04:00:10.269 --> 04:00:10.279 align:start position:0%
old growth and of mature forest for us I
 
04:00:13.910 --> 04:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
don't and and here here's why it is and
 
04:00:17.229 --> 04:00:17.239 align:start position:0%
as you heard earlier there it's like
 
04:00:19.950 --> 04:00:19.960 align:start position:0%
many things in the natural resource
 
04:00:22.870 --> 04:00:22.880 align:start position:0%
realm there are and it's a scientific
 
04:00:25.550 --> 04:00:25.560 align:start position:0%
definition and depending on whom you ask
 
04:00:26.870 --> 04:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
you're going to get a different
 
04:00:29.630 --> 04:00:29.640 align:start position:0%
definition old growth characteristics I
 
04:00:31.830 --> 04:00:31.840 align:start position:0%
can tell you in rumney right now there's
 
04:00:35.229 --> 04:00:35.239 align:start position:0%
a bog that is old growth and you walk
 
04:00:37.110 --> 04:00:37.120 align:start position:0%
through it and you would look around and
 
04:00:38.790 --> 04:00:38.800 align:start position:0%
you'd say this is an old growth growth
 
04:00:41.189 --> 04:00:41.199 align:start position:0%
all the trees are about this big and
 
04:00:44.070 --> 04:00:44.080 align:start position:0%
it's a tight Hemlock stand where these
 
04:00:47.110 --> 04:00:47.120 align:start position:0%
trees have been sitting here and they
 
04:00:51.189 --> 04:00:51.199 align:start position:0%
just slowly slowly slowly growth so my
 
04:00:54.469 --> 04:00:54.479 align:start position:0%
point is is that you know there are some
 
04:00:57.510 --> 04:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
definitions they can vary I don't have a
 
04:01:01.590 --> 04:01:01.600 align:start position:0%
definition and I wouldn't even begin and
 
04:01:05.550 --> 04:01:05.560 align:start position:0%
you know I look at a um sugar maple tree
 
04:01:07.229 --> 04:01:07.239 align:start position:0%
and I know from a forest product
 
04:01:11.349 --> 04:01:11.359 align:start position:0%
standpoint you can hit biological versus
 
04:01:14.349 --> 04:01:14.359 align:start position:0%
economic maturity economic maturity on
 
04:01:16.070 --> 04:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
some of these species you start looking
 
04:01:20.269 --> 04:01:20.279 align:start position:0%
at 60 to 80 years for economic maturity
 
04:01:22.670 --> 04:01:22.680 align:start position:0%
that sugar maple can grow for several
 
04:01:27.630 --> 04:01:27.640 align:start position:0%
hundred years so again this definition
 
04:01:30.070 --> 04:01:30.080 align:start position:0%
is leave that to the silver culturalist
 
04:01:34.710 --> 04:01:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:37.229 --> 04:01:37.239 align:start position:0%
lobbyist any other questions for the
 
04:01:37.239 --> 04:01:38.910 align:start position:0%
lobbyist any other questions for the
lobbyist

04:01:38.910 --> 04:01:38.920 align:start position:0%

FN one more time hb1 1423 FN seeing no
 
04:01:58.389 --> 04:01:58.399 align:start position:0%
one approaching and the cards all having
 
04:02:00.149 --> 04:02:00.159 align:start position:0%
gone through I'm going to close the
 
04:02:01.990 --> 04:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
hearing on hb1
 
04:02:02.000 --> 04:02:03.590 align:start position:0%
hearing on hb1
1423

04:02:03.590 --> 04:02:03.600 align:start position:0%
1423
 
04:02:06.269 --> 04:02:06.279 align:start position:0%
FN many PS do you
 
04:02:09.670 --> 04:02:09.680 align:start position:0%
have that's the next one no this is not
 
04:02:15.070 --> 04:02:15.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:18.790 --> 04:02:18.800 align:start position:0%
1423 that's the next one Here's my
 
04:02:22.429 --> 04:02:22.439 align:start position:0%
thought just take 15 minutes we can't
 
04:02:24.189 --> 04:02:24.199 align:start position:0%
for the members of the committee we're
 
04:02:26.950 --> 04:02:26.960 align:start position:0%
going to take a short break 15 minutes
 
04:02:29.790 --> 04:02:29.800 align:start position:0%
um we' normally take longer but we have
 
04:02:31.710 --> 04:02:31.720 align:start position:0%
quite a few people want to testify on
 
04:02:33.510 --> 04:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
the next bill and it's not fair to keep
 
04:02:35.429 --> 04:02:35.439 align:start position:0%
them waiting too long so we're just
 
04:02:37.750 --> 04:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
going to take a 15minute break I hope
 
04:02:39.910 --> 04:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
those that came to testify we'll
 
04:02:42.149 --> 04:02:42.159 align:start position:0%
appreciate us having a little break so
 
04:02:45.990 --> 04:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
we'll come back at a little about 116
 
04:02:48.990 --> 04:02:49.000 align:start position:0%
117 yeah if you get it if you get uh if
 
04:02:50.269 --> 04:02:50.279 align:start position:0%
you get the
 
04:02:53.229 --> 04:02:53.239 align:start position:0%
food uh you can bring it back here and
 
04:02:56.510 --> 04:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
take I'll take the heat for it so we can
 
04:02:59.870 --> 04:02:59.880 align:start position:0%
keep you so we can uh help get to the
 
04:03:02.389 --> 04:03:02.399 align:start position:0%
get to what the public needs to hear
 
04:03:02.399 --> 04:03:05.790 align:start position:0%
get to what the public needs to hear

matter of great importance to our
 
04:24:49.309 --> 04:24:49.319 align:start position:0%
communities our dams and waterways this
 
04:24:51.750 --> 04:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation is a step towards

sustainable management of these vital
 
04:24:59.830 --> 04:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
resources this bill came about because
 
04:25:02.469 --> 04:25:02.479 align:start position:0%
one of the towns I represent gtown has
 
04:25:04.630 --> 04:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
residents who will be impacted by three
 
04:25:07.229 --> 04:25:07.239 align:start position:0%
dams that came on under recent scrutiny
 
04:25:11.189 --> 04:25:11.199 align:start position:0%
by FK Federal Environmental Regulatory
 
04:25:14.510 --> 04:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
Commission thank you Fred the Hadley
 
04:25:18.229 --> 04:25:18.239 align:start position:0%
Falls Gregs Falls and Kelly Falls dams
 
04:25:20.269 --> 04:25:20.279 align:start position:0%
since working on this bill I have become
 
04:25:23.229 --> 04:25:23.239 align:start position:0%
aware of many more dams across our state
 
04:25:25.149 --> 04:25:25.159 align:start position:0%
who are being hit with the same Federal
 
04:25:27.309 --> 04:25:27.319 align:start position:0%
requirements and are facing hard
 
04:25:29.630 --> 04:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
decisions about their dams and waterways
 
04:25:32.309 --> 04:25:32.319 align:start position:0%
as well the state of New Hampshire took
 
04:25:34.510 --> 04:25:34.520 align:start position:0%
ownership of the Hadley Falls Dam in
 
04:25:37.550 --> 04:25:37.560 align:start position:0%
Goffstown in 196 8 and it began
 
04:25:40.189 --> 04:25:40.199 align:start position:0%
producing hydroelectric power from then
 
04:25:42.670 --> 04:25:42.680 align:start position:0%
until that ceased happening in
 
04:25:47.429 --> 04:25:47.439 align:start position:0%
2007 in 2013 Dees became the sole leny
 
04:25:51.030 --> 04:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
of the dam between January and March of
 
04:25:54.990 --> 04:25:55.000 align:start position:0%
2023 Dees and FK efforts to negotiate a
 
04:25:57.510 --> 04:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
new lease had failed to come to accept
 
04:26:02.149 --> 04:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
acceptable terms then in April 2023 Dees
 
04:26:04.830 --> 04:26:04.840 align:start position:0%
advised our town and other stakeholders
 
04:26:07.189 --> 04:26:07.199 align:start position:0%
that they decided to surrender the dam
 
04:26:11.030 --> 04:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
license and begin the process of dam
 
04:26:14.590 --> 04:26:14.600 align:start position:0%
removal this decision was a surprise a
 
04:26:17.510 --> 04:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
shock to all in attendance as earlier
 
04:26:19.950 --> 04:26:19.960 align:start position:0%
communication indicated surrendering the
 
04:26:21.950 --> 04:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
license was only a
 
04:26:24.309 --> 04:26:24.319 align:start position:0%
consideration Additionally the two other
 
04:26:27.030 --> 04:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
dams mentioned previously were on FK
 
04:26:29.630 --> 04:26:29.640 align:start position:0%
radar as dams that required resolution
 
04:26:33.990 --> 04:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
as well in turn this decision blindsided
 
04:26:35.990 --> 04:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
our community as it affects not only
 
04:26:38.670 --> 04:26:38.680 align:start position:0%
only Waterfront owners but our entire
 
04:26:41.429 --> 04:26:41.439 align:start position:0%
town there are recreational events that
 
04:26:43.950 --> 04:26:43.960 align:start position:0%
happen in gwn that center around these
 
04:26:46.710 --> 04:26:46.720 align:start position:0%
dams that bring in significant financial
 
04:26:50.149 --> 04:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
Revenue to local businesses as well G
 
04:26:52.670 --> 04:26:52.680 align:start position:0%
toown was left with little options but
 
04:26:54.590 --> 04:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
if this bill was in place during
 
04:26:56.830 --> 04:26:56.840 align:start position:0%
discussions about Hadley Falls we may
 
04:26:59.950 --> 04:26:59.960 align:start position:0%
have been able to save the license hb1
 
04:27:01.710 --> 04:27:01.720 align:start position:0%
1429 as
 
04:27:04.389 --> 04:27:04.399 align:start position:0%
amended which you have in front of you
 
04:27:06.149 --> 04:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
uh would present options and
 
04:27:07.870 --> 04:27:07.880 align:start position:0%
opportunities for towns and
 
04:27:10.870 --> 04:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities to have a more direct say
 
04:27:13.670 --> 04:27:13.680 align:start position:0%
in the management of these critical
 
04:27:15.990 --> 04:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
infrastructures by providing an option
 
04:27:18.389 --> 04:27:18.399 align:start position:0%
to bring ownership to the local level we
 
04:27:20.950 --> 04:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
can ensure that town decisions regarding
 
04:27:23.309 --> 04:27:23.319 align:start position:0%
their dams and waterways align with the
 
04:27:26.710 --> 04:27:26.720 align:start position:0%
unique needs and priorities of their
 
04:27:29.229 --> 04:27:29.239 align:start position:0%
communities this bill is not just about
 
04:27:32.149 --> 04:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
transferring ownership it it is about
 
04:27:34.429 --> 04:27:34.439 align:start position:0%
empowering New Hampshire's communities
 
04:27:36.790 --> 04:27:36.800 align:start position:0%
to be active custodian s of these
 
04:27:39.750 --> 04:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
valuable assets of course we understand
 
04:27:41.870 --> 04:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
that with this new found responsibility
 
04:27:44.030 --> 04:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
comes the need for careful planning
 
04:27:47.030 --> 04:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
expertise and financial commitment
 
04:27:48.870 --> 04:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
however we are confident that with the
 
04:27:50.670 --> 04:27:50.680 align:start position:0%
support of the community and
 
04:27:53.149 --> 04:27:53.159 align:start position:0%
collaboration with relevant stakeholders
 
04:27:55.229 --> 04:27:55.239 align:start position:0%
we can successfully navigate these
 
04:27:57.429 --> 04:27:57.439 align:start position:0%
challenges and ensure a smooth
 
04:28:00.030 --> 04:28:00.040 align:start position:0%
transition Dees expressed initial
 
04:28:01.790 --> 04:28:01.800 align:start position:0%
concerns about the loan aspect of the
 
04:28:04.229 --> 04:28:04.239 align:start position:0%
bill and after meeting with them over
 
04:28:06.429 --> 04:28:06.439 align:start position:0%
our holiday break and Amendment was draw
 
04:28:09.070 --> 04:28:09.080 align:start position:0%
up drawn up that was agreeable to all
 
04:28:11.670 --> 04:28:11.680 align:start position:0%
that amendment is in front of you today
 
04:28:13.870 --> 04:28:13.880 align:start position:0%
we were able to get bipartisan support
 
04:28:16.349 --> 04:28:16.359 align:start position:0%
on this as well as many New Hampshire
 
04:28:19.149 --> 04:28:19.159 align:start position:0%
communities are going through similar
 
04:28:21.830 --> 04:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
situations in conclusion this bill will
 
04:28:24.750 --> 04:28:24.760 align:start position:0%
not require a t a town or municipality
 
04:28:27.590 --> 04:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
to take ownership of their dams that's
 
04:28:29.990 --> 04:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
important to note it's not a requirement
 
04:28:32.389 --> 04:28:32.399 align:start position:0%
but it gives them an option to do
 
04:28:36.269 --> 04:28:36.279 align:start position:0%
so we didn't have that in gtown recently
 
04:28:38.389 --> 04:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
I ask the members of this committee to
 
04:28:40.510 --> 04:28:40.520 align:start position:0%
consider the profound implications of
 
04:28:43.229 --> 04:28:43.239 align:start position:0%
this legislation as an opportunity for
 
04:28:46.189 --> 04:28:46.199 align:start position:0%
local empowerment sustainability and
 
04:28:46.199 --> 04:28:47.590 align:start position:0%
local empowerment sustainability and
community-driven

04:28:47.590 --> 04:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
community-driven
 
04:28:51.750 --> 04:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
progress thank you um I know that uh
 
04:28:54.389 --> 04:28:54.399 align:start position:0%
Dees is here that can answer any
 
04:28:56.630 --> 04:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
technical questions or anything else you
 
04:28:58.870 --> 04:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
have so thank you for hearing me
 
04:29:01.389 --> 04:29:01.399 align:start position:0%
today representative
 
04:29:03.229 --> 04:29:03.239 align:start position:0%
Kelly thank you for being here are you
 
04:29:04.630 --> 04:29:04.640 align:start position:0%
able to elaborate on the differences
 
04:29:06.229 --> 04:29:06.239 align:start position:0%
between the amendment and
 
04:29:08.790 --> 04:29:08.800 align:start position:0%
the original bill just yes it's mostly
 
04:29:13.510 --> 04:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
just um the the the fund the fund
 
04:29:18.189 --> 04:29:18.199 align:start position:0%
section changes to revolving Dam fund so
 
04:29:20.590 --> 04:29:20.600 align:start position:0%
you you'll see the differences in in
 
04:29:23.550 --> 04:29:23.560 align:start position:0%
that language um so that's that's the
 
04:29:26.710 --> 04:29:26.720 align:start position:0%
main differences and and I know um so
 
04:29:29.309 --> 04:29:29.319 align:start position:0%
Dees is the one that mostly you know we
 
04:29:31.550 --> 04:29:31.560 align:start position:0%
worked on the amendment but they came up
 
04:29:35.750 --> 04:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
with um these changes that would be
 
04:29:38.910 --> 04:29:38.920 align:start position:0%
agreeable to them and uh yeah and also
 
04:29:41.910 --> 04:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Municipal Association
 
04:29:46.750 --> 04:29:46.760 align:start position:0%
so yep any other questions for the
 
04:29:48.750 --> 04:29:48.760 align:start position:0%
representative seeing none thank you for
 
04:29:52.109 --> 04:29:52.119 align:start position:0%

Alexander in support of the bill one of
 
04:29:54.680 --> 04:29:58.469 align:start position:0%
Alexander in support of the bill one of
the

04:29:58.469 --> 04:29:58.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:00.950 --> 04:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors thank you Mr chair members
 
04:30:03.109 --> 04:30:03.119 align:start position:0%
of resources Recreation development for
 
04:30:04.630 --> 04:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Joe Alexander I
 
04:30:06.630 --> 04:30:06.640 align:start position:0%
represent the town of go Town only in
 
04:30:09.109 --> 04:30:09.119 align:start position:0%
the state house um I would like to Echo
 
04:30:11.030 --> 04:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of what representative merer said
 
04:30:13.149 --> 04:30:13.159 align:start position:0%
um just to start again this is a
 
04:30:15.109 --> 04:30:15.119 align:start position:0%
Statewide issue if your town or
 
04:30:17.510 --> 04:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
municipality or city in your District
 
04:30:19.349 --> 04:30:19.359 align:start position:0%
hasn't dealt with this there are over
 
04:30:21.510 --> 04:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
200 dams in the state um this is going
 
04:30:22.910 --> 04:30:22.920 align:start position:0%
to provide an option for them I think
 
04:30:24.550 --> 04:30:24.560 align:start position:0%
it's really important to note that it
 
04:30:26.309 --> 04:30:26.319 align:start position:0%
may not have happened to you yet but it
 
04:30:27.429 --> 04:30:27.439 align:start position:0%
may happen to you because there's a lot
 
04:30:30.710 --> 04:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
of dams that are headed into red listed
 
04:30:33.030 --> 04:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
um you know this is a goth Town example
 
04:30:34.389 --> 04:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
but when we talk about economic
 
04:30:36.750 --> 04:30:36.760 align:start position:0%
viability of our downtown town the dam
 
04:30:39.870 --> 04:30:39.880 align:start position:0%
really put the dam was a huge part of
 
04:30:41.269 --> 04:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
that factor I don't know if anybody's
 
04:30:43.590 --> 04:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
been to the golf toown pumpkin rata but
 
04:30:45.229 --> 04:30:45.239 align:start position:0%
we carve out pumpkins and Float them
 
04:30:47.269 --> 04:30:47.279 align:start position:0%
down the river and and the dam was able
 
04:30:49.670 --> 04:30:49.680 align:start position:0%
to to be that buffer to allow us to do
 
04:30:51.389 --> 04:30:51.399 align:start position:0%
that so it was like one of our big
 
04:30:53.710 --> 04:30:53.720 align:start position:0%
downtown festivals of the year so very
 
04:30:56.750 --> 04:30:56.760 align:start position:0%
important to us um I just spoke to New
 
04:30:58.429 --> 04:30:58.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association who was
 
04:31:00.990 --> 04:31:01.000 align:start position:0%
planning on testifying they're behind me
 
04:31:02.750 --> 04:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
um they are supported supportive of the
 
04:31:04.429 --> 04:31:04.439 align:start position:0%
local option and concept and they just
 
04:31:06.149 --> 04:31:06.159 align:start position:0%
have two minor changes that I believe
 
04:31:07.990 --> 04:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
that we can bring to the committee and
 
04:31:10.510 --> 04:31:10.520 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to send an amendment over and
 
04:31:12.630 --> 04:31:12.640 align:start position:0%
to get you a final Amendment um to look
 
04:31:15.469 --> 04:31:15.479 align:start position:0%
at and then again just to note this bill
 
04:31:17.590 --> 04:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
does not have a fiscal impact it creates
 
04:31:19.790 --> 04:31:19.800 align:start position:0%
a revolving fund and puts a dollar in it
 
04:31:22.189 --> 04:31:22.199 align:start position:0%
so then that we can decide in the future
 
04:31:23.830 --> 04:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
in a different legislature if you'd like
 
04:31:26.030 --> 04:31:26.040 align:start position:0%
to fund it or anything but I think that
 
04:31:28.269 --> 04:31:28.279 align:start position:0%
this at least establishes the fund in
 
04:31:29.990 --> 04:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
concept by putting a dollar in it so
 
04:31:32.590 --> 04:31:32.600 align:start position:0%
with that uh again technical questions
 
04:31:34.070 --> 04:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
I'll refer to Dees but I wanted to
 
04:31:36.790 --> 04:31:36.800 align:start position:0%
stress some of those points thank you
 
04:31:39.349 --> 04:31:39.359 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions for the
 
04:31:42.389 --> 04:31:42.399 align:start position:0%
representative one whole
 
04:31:44.710 --> 04:31:44.720 align:start position:0%
dollar representative
 
04:31:47.030 --> 04:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
Derby thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
04:31:49.109 --> 04:31:49.119 align:start position:0%
taking my question um if you want to
 
04:31:50.550 --> 04:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
defer this question it's totally okay
 
04:31:53.950 --> 04:31:53.960 align:start position:0%
with me sure but I noticed that there's
 
04:31:55.950 --> 04:31:55.960 align:start position:0%
already statue that allows the
 
04:31:58.630 --> 04:31:58.640 align:start position:0%
municipality to take ownership um by
 
04:32:01.510 --> 04:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
eminent domain of a dam um once it's
 
04:32:04.590 --> 04:32:04.600 align:start position:0%
found in dis disrepair and it seems like
 
04:32:05.990 --> 04:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
if the
 
04:32:07.990 --> 04:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
foreseen Factor here is the federal
 
04:32:09.590 --> 04:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
government says this Dam needs to be
 
04:32:11.550 --> 04:32:11.560 align:start position:0%
repaired then it isn't disrepair and
 
04:32:14.070 --> 04:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
would allow the municipality to go
 
04:32:16.189 --> 04:32:16.199 align:start position:0%
through that eminent domain proceeding I
 
04:32:18.910 --> 04:32:18.920 align:start position:0%
can give you the statute if you care Sor
 
04:32:19.750 --> 04:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
I was wondering if that was a
 
04:32:21.750 --> 04:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
consideration or if the real driving
 
04:32:25.750 --> 04:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
Factor here is the um is the the
 
04:32:27.790 --> 04:32:27.800 align:start position:0%
revolving fund that because you want you
 
04:32:30.750 --> 04:32:30.760 align:start position:0%
want money to support to provide for the
 
04:32:32.469 --> 04:32:32.479 align:start position:0%
DM repairers well thank you
 
04:32:33.950 --> 04:32:33.960 align:start position:0%
representative for your question I think
 
04:32:36.109 --> 04:32:36.119 align:start position:0%
it's the ladder so I would say that
 
04:32:37.590 --> 04:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
creating this revolving fund would give
 
04:32:39.389 --> 04:32:39.399 align:start position:0%
a municipality options because in the
 
04:32:42.590 --> 04:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
example with gown we really didn't have
 
04:32:44.830 --> 04:32:44.840 align:start position:0%
$10 million to Shell out to purchase the
 
04:32:47.469 --> 04:32:47.479 align:start position:0%
dam because um Dees will stress that
 
04:32:50.349 --> 04:32:50.359 align:start position:0%
they offer the dam to us for a dollar um
 
04:32:52.469 --> 04:32:52.479 align:start position:0%
but with all the repairs needed and
 
04:32:53.710 --> 04:32:53.720 align:start position:0%
things like that it was something where
 
04:32:55.109 --> 04:32:55.119 align:start position:0%
it wasn't a realistic option for
 
04:32:56.750 --> 04:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
Goffstown but I believe creating this
 
04:32:58.870 --> 04:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
fund will allow municipalities the
 
04:33:01.309 --> 04:33:01.319 align:start position:0%
option um to tap into that resource if
 
04:33:03.029 --> 04:33:03.039 align:start position:0%
they need
 
04:33:05.750 --> 04:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
it any other questions for the re
 
04:33:07.830 --> 04:33:07.840 align:start position:0%

04:33:22.269 --> 04:33:22.279 align:start position:0%
PL thank you Mr chair uh thank you for
 
04:33:24.349 --> 04:33:24.359 align:start position:0%
allowing allowing me to speak before the
 
04:33:27.029 --> 04:33:27.039 align:start position:0%
committee I won't touch on what was just
 
04:33:29.789 --> 04:33:29.799 align:start position:0%
said I agree with all of it but the bill
 
04:33:33.390 --> 04:33:33.400 align:start position:0%
now has a dollar setup for the fund and
 
04:33:35.070 --> 04:33:35.080 align:start position:0%
nothing can come out of it till it's 2
 
04:33:37.150 --> 04:33:37.160 align:start position:0%
and a half half million at least in it
 
04:33:39.590 --> 04:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
well and there's no mechanism right now
 
04:33:41.869 --> 04:33:41.879 align:start position:0%
to get that two and a half million in it
 
04:33:44.390 --> 04:33:44.400 align:start position:0%
but I'm asking our our inde not to worry
 
04:33:47.510 --> 04:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
about that pass the bill and uh the
 
04:33:49.750 --> 04:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
dollar would be set up but then it go to
 
04:33:51.910 --> 04:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means for because if it's a
 
04:33:54.709 --> 04:33:54.719 align:start position:0%
revolving fund that a dedicated fund
 
04:33:57.310 --> 04:33:57.320 align:start position:0%
that's what uh Ways and Means do does
 
04:33:59.990 --> 04:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
and then the finance finance committee
 
04:34:02.230 --> 04:34:02.240 align:start position:0%
won't have to address it address it this
 
04:34:04.310 --> 04:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
year but they will in a a budget to be
 
04:34:06.029 --> 04:34:06.039 align:start position:0%
able to get some money in there there
 
04:34:07.830 --> 04:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
but that's something that rr&amp;d doesn't
 
04:34:09.429 --> 04:34:09.439 align:start position:0%
have to worry about that's that's why
 
04:34:11.070 --> 04:34:11.080 align:start position:0%
there's an FN note to go to a second
 
04:34:14.070 --> 04:34:14.080 align:start position:0%
committee thank you any questions for
 
04:34:17.070 --> 04:34:17.080 align:start position:0%
the representative representative Darby
 
04:34:19.109 --> 04:34:19.119 align:start position:0%
thank you m Mr chair thank you for
 
04:34:21.029 --> 04:34:21.039 align:start position:0%
taking my question so I haven't been
 
04:34:22.830 --> 04:34:22.840 align:start position:0%
able to read this bill this amendment
 
04:34:25.590 --> 04:34:25.600 align:start position:0%
yet but are you saying that the the loan
 
04:34:27.390 --> 04:34:27.400 align:start position:0%
process is different in this amendment
 
04:34:29.029 --> 04:34:29.039 align:start position:0%
than it was in the original bill which
 
04:34:33.109 --> 04:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
used the um an existing fund that would
 
04:34:35.390 --> 04:34:35.400 align:start position:0%
that is according to the fiscal note on
 
04:34:39.910 --> 04:34:39.920 align:start position:0%
the bill funded by um uh what is it the
 
04:34:39.920 --> 04:34:41.070 align:start position:0%
the bill funded by um uh what is it the
um

04:34:41.070 --> 04:34:41.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:43.150 --> 04:34:43.160 align:start position:0%
hydropower is this a different fund or
 
04:34:45.349 --> 04:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
is the same I I think it's a different
 
04:34:48.150 --> 04:34:48.160 align:start position:0%
fund it's a brand new fund with a dollar
 
04:34:50.629 --> 04:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
in it and then because what you you
 
04:34:52.150 --> 04:34:52.160 align:start position:0%
can't spend any money till there's at
 
04:34:54.551 --> 04:34:54.561 align:start position:0%
least 2 and a half million uh in in the
 
04:34:56.789 --> 04:34:56.799 align:start position:0%
bill the language of the bill and so
 
04:34:58.709 --> 04:34:58.719 align:start position:0%
that that money has to be in be put in
 
04:35:00.310 --> 04:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
there somehow and that's something for
 
04:35:02.910 --> 04:35:02.920 align:start position:0%
finance committee to work
 
04:35:06.429 --> 04:35:06.439 align:start position:0%
on thanks any other
 
04:35:10.670 --> 04:35:10.680 align:start position:0%
questions representative Ron thank you
 
04:35:12.830 --> 04:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
I'm still trying to digest the bill
 
04:35:15.269 --> 04:35:15.279 align:start position:0%
representative PL but my qu my question
 
04:35:17.070 --> 04:35:17.080 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking it
 
04:35:21.949 --> 04:35:21.959 align:start position:0%
is if if the state does not fund the the
 
04:35:26.230 --> 04:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
revolving fund but yet the town wants to
 
04:35:28.551 --> 04:35:28.561 align:start position:0%
take ownership of the dam but then they
 
04:35:31.830 --> 04:35:31.840 align:start position:0%
can't access the loan money to for
 
04:35:34.709 --> 04:35:34.719 align:start position:0%
repair any needed repairs would it be
 
04:35:37.310 --> 04:35:37.320 align:start position:0%
possible over the town then to go to the
 
04:35:40.551 --> 04:35:40.561 align:start position:0%
town voters with uh let's say a bond to
 
04:35:43.150 --> 04:35:43.160 align:start position:0%
bond the repairs so that they're not
 
04:35:46.070 --> 04:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
hung I'm just I'm looking at a situation
 
04:35:51.230 --> 04:35:51.240 align:start position:0%
where the state is going to um uh you
 
04:35:55.590 --> 04:35:55.600 align:start position:0%
know dis you know uh get rid of a a dam
 
04:35:57.910 --> 04:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
so a town may want to say hold it we
 
04:35:59.349 --> 04:35:59.359 align:start position:0%
want the option to get it the town
 
04:36:01.910 --> 04:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
decides yes we want that Dam but there's
 
04:36:03.709 --> 04:36:03.719 align:start position:0%
no money in the revolving fund to make
 
04:36:06.990 --> 04:36:07.000 align:start position:0%
the repairs so the town likely I would
 
04:36:08.629 --> 04:36:08.639 align:start position:0%
expect would not want to take possession
 
04:36:10.990 --> 04:36:11.000 align:start position:0%
of a possession of a dam until they have
 
04:36:14.109 --> 04:36:14.119 align:start position:0%
the money to do the repairs would they
 
04:36:16.390 --> 04:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
then be able to go in bond get a
 
04:36:20.150 --> 04:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
municipal bond for that if the Loan Fund
 
04:36:22.709 --> 04:36:22.719 align:start position:0%
doesn't get um the two and a half
 
04:36:25.510 --> 04:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
million that is another option yes okay
 
04:36:27.390 --> 04:36:27.400 align:start position:0%
um we would have to go to the voters
 
04:36:29.349 --> 04:36:29.359 align:start position:0%
nevertheless because you you committing
 
04:36:31.910 --> 04:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
to that kind of money we'd go to the the
 
04:36:34.150 --> 04:36:34.160 align:start position:0%
the town's people to get approval for
 
04:36:36.189 --> 04:36:36.199 align:start position:0%
the for the town to take it on
 
04:36:39.029 --> 04:36:39.039 align:start position:0%
obligation with we would either way not
 
04:36:41.429 --> 04:36:41.439 align:start position:0%
come up with the money from the town
 
04:36:44.349 --> 04:36:44.359 align:start position:0%
immediately but we either pay a bond
 
04:36:46.390 --> 04:36:46.400 align:start position:0%
interest and dividends over time or
 
04:36:48.230 --> 04:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
through this mechanism we' pay be paying
 
04:36:52.109 --> 04:36:52.119 align:start position:0%
the state back uh through this mechanism
 
04:36:55.470 --> 04:36:55.480 align:start position:0%
follow so would the town people have to
 
04:36:58.709 --> 04:36:58.719 align:start position:0%
vote on taking that loan out then yes
 
04:37:00.349 --> 04:37:00.359 align:start position:0%
okay so they'd have to vote either way
 
04:37:02.470 --> 04:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
either for a bond or to take money from
 
04:37:05.310 --> 04:37:05.320 align:start position:0%
the revolving fund yeah correct okay all
 
04:37:08.830 --> 04:37:08.840 align:start position:0%
right thank you any other questions
 
04:37:10.551 --> 04:37:10.561 align:start position:0%

happy New Year to you all and uh so I'm
 
04:37:33.750 --> 04:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
happy to chat it's been a terrific uh
 
04:37:35.269 --> 04:37:35.279 align:start position:0%
experience working with with the
 
04:37:37.629 --> 04:37:37.639 align:start position:0%
sponsors on this bill providing some
 
04:37:39.949 --> 04:37:39.959 align:start position:0%
technical assistance from Dees and it's
 
04:37:42.070 --> 04:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
it really has been uh it's been great uh
 
04:37:43.670 --> 04:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
that that exchange has been wonderful I
 
04:37:45.709 --> 04:37:45.719 align:start position:0%
think these sponsors have have done a
 
04:37:48.869 --> 04:37:48.879 align:start position:0%
great job on this um so I'm just going
 
04:37:50.029 --> 04:37:50.039 align:start position:0%
to provide a couple of pieces of
 
04:37:51.551 --> 04:37:51.561 align:start position:0%
information I sent around a letter of
 
04:37:53.349 --> 04:37:53.359 align:start position:0%
testimony uh I just going to point out a
 
04:37:56.551 --> 04:37:56.561 align:start position:0%
couple of pieces in there Dees has 276
 
04:37:59.269 --> 04:37:59.279 align:start position:0%
dams that we manage for the state owned
 
04:38:02.830 --> 04:38:02.840 align:start position:0%
by uh some of them by Dees some by fish
 
04:38:06.949 --> 04:38:06.959 align:start position:0%
and games some by do a few by dancer and
 
04:38:09.789 --> 04:38:09.799 align:start position:0%
so we provide uh assistance to those
 
04:38:13.949 --> 04:38:13.959 align:start position:0%
agencies in managing those dams uh those
 
04:38:16.310 --> 04:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
uh together uh you know I don't know
 
04:38:18.349 --> 04:38:18.359 align:start position:0%
what the average age of those dams is
 
04:38:21.109 --> 04:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
but it's probably approaching a 100 so
 
04:38:24.310 --> 04:38:24.320 align:start position:0%
we have an aging uh infrastructure uh of
 
04:38:27.590 --> 04:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
all of these dams we know that of the 60
 
04:38:29.670 --> 04:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
high-hazard dams that we open we have
 
04:38:32.269 --> 04:38:32.279 align:start position:0%
that is high Hazard is a dam not it has
 
04:38:33.310 --> 04:38:33.320 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with the condition of the
 
04:38:35.470 --> 04:38:35.480 align:start position:0%
dam but that Dam should should it fail
 
04:38:38.150 --> 04:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
would cause life likely cause Li loss of
 
04:38:40.709 --> 04:38:40.719 align:start position:0%
life we have 60 of those in the state
 
04:38:43.109 --> 04:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
that the state uh maintains and they
 
04:38:44.830 --> 04:38:44.840 align:start position:0%
currently have a capital need of about
 
04:38:49.349 --> 04:38:49.359 align:start position:0%
$300 million to just keep them in repair
 
04:38:51.830 --> 04:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
the rest of those dams the other 200
 
04:38:54.990 --> 04:38:55.000 align:start position:0%
whatever 216 um have a capital need of
 
04:38:58.670 --> 04:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
about 115 $116 million that we know of
 
04:39:01.590 --> 04:39:01.600 align:start position:0%
right now just to keep them in repair I
 
04:39:04.349 --> 04:39:04.359 align:start position:0%
just want to put that in context um
 
04:39:06.470 --> 04:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
where about to go out to bid on goose we
 
04:39:08.750 --> 04:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
just went out to bid on Goose Pond uh
 
04:39:11.869 --> 04:39:11.879 align:start position:0%
that is a dam that's being rebuilt and
 
04:39:14.830 --> 04:39:14.840 align:start position:0%
uh the cost of that was $6 million uh
 
04:39:17.670 --> 04:39:17.680 align:start position:0%
relatively straightforward project um
 
04:39:20.869 --> 04:39:20.879 align:start position:0%
that is on top of the already probably a
 
04:39:22.349 --> 04:39:22.359 align:start position:0%
quarter of a million dollars we've spent
 
04:39:24.830 --> 04:39:24.840 align:start position:0%
on design so these projects are not
 
04:39:27.869 --> 04:39:27.879 align:start position:0%
cheap um and so we are making hard
 
04:39:30.910 --> 04:39:30.920 align:start position:0%
choices every single day about what goes
 
04:39:34.150 --> 04:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
to the capital budget for requests and
 
04:39:35.949 --> 04:39:35.959 align:start position:0%
what has to get get funded first what
 
04:39:38.310 --> 04:39:38.320 align:start position:0%
has to get repaired first so I just want
 
04:39:40.470 --> 04:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
to put that in context of this bill and
 
04:39:42.230 --> 04:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
all of the other testimony you'll hear
 
04:39:44.270 --> 04:39:44.280 align:start position:0%
about uh the various different uh Dam
 
04:39:46.670 --> 04:39:46.680 align:start position:0%
bills that are coming before you uh this
 
04:39:48.230 --> 04:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
session and there are a
 
04:39:50.590 --> 04:39:50.600 align:start position:0%
number so I about this bill in
 
04:39:52.628 --> 04:39:52.638 align:start position:0%
particular uh the transfer this was
 
04:39:54.390 --> 04:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
raised representative Darby you raised a
 
04:39:57.990 --> 04:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
good question that U there currently is
 
04:39:59.868 --> 04:39:59.878 align:start position:0%
obviously a mechanism like I said I'll
 
04:40:01.670 --> 04:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
sell you you name the dam I'll sell it
 
04:40:05.310 --> 04:40:05.320 align:start position:0%
to you for a dollar uh but um
 
04:40:07.788 --> 04:40:07.798 align:start position:0%
what isn't in this is that should the
 
04:40:10.350 --> 04:40:10.360 align:start position:0%
state determine as I think we've made
 
04:40:12.190 --> 04:40:12.200 align:start position:0%
that determination on Hadley Falls that
 
04:40:16.430 --> 04:40:16.440 align:start position:0%
the best option is for removal that the
 
04:40:19.230 --> 04:40:19.240 align:start position:0%
there's no mechanism for the uh for the
 
04:40:21.390 --> 04:40:21.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities to say hey stop I might
 
04:40:23.150 --> 04:40:23.160 align:start position:0%
want to buy this and it takes a while to
 
04:40:24.868 --> 04:40:24.878 align:start position:0%
get through that process if you're a
 
04:40:26.628 --> 04:40:26.638 align:start position:0%
community and so I think that's what
 
04:40:29.350 --> 04:40:29.360 align:start position:0%
this is recognizing obviously the town
 
04:40:30.910 --> 04:40:30.920 align:start position:0%
can take something on imminent domain if
 
04:40:33.550 --> 04:40:33.560 align:start position:0%
it's private um obviously we can sell
 
04:40:35.510 --> 04:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
something there there's a whole process
 
04:40:37.708 --> 04:40:37.718 align:start position:0%
for Surplus lands that you're probably
 
04:40:39.868 --> 04:40:39.878 align:start position:0%
familiar with but what this bill does is
 
04:40:40.990 --> 04:40:41.000 align:start position:0%
it sort of gets that there's a little
 
04:40:42.470 --> 04:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
bit of a donnut hole there that should
 
04:40:44.190 --> 04:40:44.200 align:start position:0%
the state want to go down this road and
 
04:40:45.470 --> 04:40:45.480 align:start position:0%
again I think we don't have a problem
 
04:40:48.070 --> 04:40:48.080 align:start position:0%
with that these are long project they
 
04:40:50.110 --> 04:40:50.120 align:start position:0%
take a long time in planning and
 
04:40:52.070 --> 04:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
implementation and we want to make sure
 
04:40:53.830 --> 04:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
that however this goes that the
 
04:40:55.510 --> 04:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
community has adequate time so if that's
 
04:40:57.030 --> 04:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
something that the communities feel like
 
04:40:58.868 --> 04:40:58.878 align:start position:0%
they need I think that that's something
 
04:41:01.910 --> 04:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
that's that's certainly uh a
 
04:41:04.830 --> 04:41:04.840 align:start position:0%
warranted um this this the loan business
 
04:41:07.070 --> 04:41:07.080 align:start position:0%
is a little challenging uh you know we
 
04:41:09.150 --> 04:41:09.160 align:start position:0%
currently run at least three or four
 
04:41:12.150 --> 04:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
different banks uh at Dees uh the Old
 
04:41:16.190 --> 04:41:16.200 align:start position:0%
Bailey Savings and Loan um and um so so
 
04:41:18.628 --> 04:41:18.638 align:start position:0%
we are Bankers as well as environmental
 
04:41:22.190 --> 04:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
folks we funds we have a a past fund all
 
04:41:24.390 --> 04:41:24.400 align:start position:0%
of these are things that and mtbe we
 
04:41:25.470 --> 04:41:25.480 align:start position:0%
have a whole bunch of these different
 
04:41:28.150 --> 04:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
funds that we run uh what we know about
 
04:41:29.708 --> 04:41:29.718 align:start position:0%
that is that they're incredibly labor
 
04:41:32.430 --> 04:41:32.440 align:start position:0%
intensive uh and it requires outside
 
04:41:34.070 --> 04:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
parties to do thirdparty review of
 
04:41:36.310 --> 04:41:36.320 align:start position:0%
finances there's a lot of mechanisms
 
04:41:38.590 --> 04:41:38.600 align:start position:0%
that go into being a banker as well as
 
04:41:40.230 --> 04:41:40.240 align:start position:0%
just keeping track of things and making
 
04:41:42.190 --> 04:41:42.200 align:start position:0%
sure that all of that runs smoothly not
 
04:41:43.750 --> 04:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
to mention the engineering review that
 
04:41:45.270 --> 04:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
has to go into the loans that we're
 
04:41:48.590 --> 04:41:48.600 align:start position:0%
actually uh sending out so so having
 
04:41:50.070 --> 04:41:50.080 align:start position:0%
some dollars in that now we did have a
 
04:41:52.830 --> 04:41:52.840 align:start position:0%
loan program uh with the dam Bureau that
 
04:41:56.750 --> 04:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
was set up in 2004 and was eliminated in
 
04:42:00.390 --> 04:42:00.400 align:start position:0%
2019 that was funded out of uh
 
04:42:00.400 --> 04:42:01.628 align:start position:0%
2019 that was funded out of uh
administrative

04:42:01.628 --> 04:42:01.638 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
04:42:04.190 --> 04:42:04.200 align:start position:0%
fines so and the most money that was
 
04:42:06.190 --> 04:42:06.200 align:start position:0%
ever in that fund was
 
04:42:08.750 --> 04:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
$70,000 and as you've probably surmised
 
04:42:10.270 --> 04:42:10.280 align:start position:0%
just from the the dollars that I've been
 
04:42:12.628 --> 04:42:12.638 align:start position:0%
throwing around in terms of dam repair
 
04:42:15.350 --> 04:42:15.360 align:start position:0%
$770,000 doesn't buy you very much it
 
04:42:17.150 --> 04:42:17.160 align:start position:0%
barely gets a consultant out of bed in
 
04:42:20.788 --> 04:42:20.798 align:start position:0%
the morning uh to look at your Dam so so
 
04:42:22.430 --> 04:42:22.440 align:start position:0%
putting some dollars into that will be
 
04:42:24.510 --> 04:42:24.520 align:start position:0%
really important um and then setting up
 
04:42:26.430 --> 04:42:26.440 align:start position:0%
a new fund this is a this would be a new
 
04:42:28.708 --> 04:42:28.718 align:start position:0%
fund outside of the dam maintenance fund
 
04:42:30.310 --> 04:42:30.320 align:start position:0%
the damn maintenance fund itself is
 
04:42:31.788 --> 04:42:31.798 align:start position:0%
extraordinarly stressed we have about
 
04:42:36.590 --> 04:42:36.600 align:start position:0%
$1.2 million to do maintenance on 276
 
04:42:38.750 --> 04:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
dams we are currently getting rid of a
 
04:42:41.550 --> 04:42:41.560 align:start position:0%
couple of dams uh York Dam in Penacook
 
04:42:43.550 --> 04:42:43.560 align:start position:0%
is currently being purchased by the
 
04:42:47.470 --> 04:42:47.480 align:start position:0%
hydro operator and um there's uh another
 
04:42:50.030 --> 04:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
Dam Warren Dam uh which is currently
 
04:42:51.910 --> 04:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
going through the whole uh process
 
04:42:54.830 --> 04:42:54.840 align:start position:0%
through cord uh and uh to go to the town
 
04:42:54.840 --> 04:42:56.230 align:start position:0%
through cord uh and uh to go to the town
of

04:42:56.230 --> 04:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:42:59.390 --> 04:42:59.400 align:start position:0%
Warren so um the the new the language
 
04:43:01.110 --> 04:43:01.120 align:start position:0%
that you see in the amendment is largely
 
04:43:03.230 --> 04:43:03.240 align:start position:0%
based on information out of our srf
 
04:43:05.670 --> 04:43:05.680 align:start position:0%
programs which are la standing loan
 
04:43:10.430 --> 04:43:10.440 align:start position:0%
programs and um they um so so some of
 
04:43:11.788 --> 04:43:11.798 align:start position:0%
the lessons we've learned about that in
 
04:43:14.470 --> 04:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
terms of the intensity of of Staff need
 
04:43:17.150 --> 04:43:17.160 align:start position:0%
in order to run those kinds of things
 
04:43:19.990 --> 04:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
with that I will end and um just point
 
04:43:24.788 --> 04:43:24.798 align:start position:0%
you towards uh hb1 1277 and SB
 
04:43:27.990 --> 04:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
549 which would establish commissions
 
04:43:30.430 --> 04:43:30.440 align:start position:0%
legislative commissions to look at how
 
04:43:33.510 --> 04:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
we fund the maintenance of dams over
 
04:43:36.430 --> 04:43:36.440 align:start position:0%
time it was 2004 was the last time that
 
04:43:38.430 --> 04:43:38.440 align:start position:0%
that issue was brought up in a
 
04:43:40.550 --> 04:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
comprehensive way and if you look at
 
04:43:42.470 --> 04:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
this bill it does sort of fit into that
 
04:43:46.310 --> 04:43:46.320 align:start position:0%
whole rubric of how do we go about
 
04:43:48.510 --> 04:43:48.520 align:start position:0%
dealing with this you know large number
 
04:43:51.350 --> 04:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
of of of dams in the state so with that
 
04:43:54.470 --> 04:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
I will open up myself to any questions
 
04:43:57.270 --> 04:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
uh that you might have and um thank you
 
04:43:59.310 --> 04:43:59.320 align:start position:0%
very much for the opportunity thank you
 
04:44:00.990 --> 04:44:01.000 align:start position:0%
representative L
 
04:44:04.190 --> 04:44:04.200 align:start position:0%
montin thank you and um thank you for
 
04:44:07.230 --> 04:44:07.240 align:start position:0%
taking my question when I first saw this
 
04:44:10.470 --> 04:44:10.480 align:start position:0%
bill and I thought if we're talking
 
04:44:13.150 --> 04:44:13.160 align:start position:0%
about dams that were are slated for to
 
04:44:16.470 --> 04:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
demolition to be taken down my thought
 
04:44:18.830 --> 04:44:18.840 align:start position:0%
was they're being taken down for
 
04:44:22.030 --> 04:44:22.040 align:start position:0%
environmental reasons not just because
 
04:44:24.590 --> 04:44:24.600 align:start position:0%
they're in disrepair but most of the
 
04:44:26.670 --> 04:44:26.680 align:start position:0%
discussion has been about the
 
04:44:29.030 --> 04:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
disrepair but that would be a concern to
 
04:44:35.390 --> 04:44:35.400 align:start position:0%
me if um say Dees has said well the
 
04:44:37.708 --> 04:44:37.718 align:start position:0%
continued existence of this dam is
 
04:44:41.430 --> 04:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
causing problems with water flow and the
 
04:44:43.550 --> 04:44:43.560 align:start position:0%
health of the river
 
04:44:43.560 --> 04:44:45.110 align:start position:0%
health of the river
Downstream

04:44:45.110 --> 04:44:45.120 align:start position:0%
Downstream
 
04:44:48.670 --> 04:44:48.680 align:start position:0%
um but then we turn it over to the town
 
04:44:51.430 --> 04:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
so they can keep it which I love
 
04:44:54.390 --> 04:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
historic old dams it's beautiful but I
 
04:44:56.430 --> 04:44:56.440 align:start position:0%
also know that they're often at the
 
04:44:58.750 --> 04:44:58.760 align:start position:0%
expense of the health of the river so
 
04:45:00.510 --> 04:45:00.520 align:start position:0%
how would if we give
 
04:45:05.030 --> 04:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
up um control of the dam are we
 
04:45:07.030 --> 04:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
completely giving up control over it as
 
04:45:10.910 --> 04:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
far as um environmental regulation or
 
04:45:13.868 --> 04:45:13.878 align:start position:0%
with Dees still want to say well we'll
 
04:45:17.390 --> 04:45:17.400 align:start position:0%
sell it on the condition that you add
 
04:45:19.750 --> 04:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
fish ladders or things like that so that
 
04:45:21.430 --> 04:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering about the environmental
 
04:45:23.830 --> 04:45:23.840 align:start position:0%
impact that's a that's a great question
 
04:45:27.110 --> 04:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um and what I would
 
04:45:28.948 --> 04:45:28.958 align:start position:0%
say is that anytime there's a decision
 
04:45:31.750 --> 04:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
to remove a dam it's a pretty big deal
 
04:45:33.868 --> 04:45:33.878 align:start position:0%
with few exceptions and it takes a long
 
04:45:37.190 --> 04:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
time to get through that process so and
 
04:45:40.590 --> 04:45:40.600 align:start position:0%
it's almost always by the time we get to
 
04:45:43.788 --> 04:45:43.798 align:start position:0%
that point there has been uh you know a
 
04:45:45.350 --> 04:45:45.360 align:start position:0%
lot of discussion in the community
 
04:45:46.750 --> 04:45:46.760 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of debate about
 
04:45:48.550 --> 04:45:48.560 align:start position:0%
whether or not somebody wants to take it
 
04:45:51.510 --> 04:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
on and do something else with it and
 
04:45:53.390 --> 04:45:53.400 align:start position:0%
there's there will be a full discussion
 
04:45:55.030 --> 04:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
in the community about the environmental
 
04:45:56.868 --> 04:45:56.878 align:start position:0%
benefits this you know Durham is a
 
04:45:59.110 --> 04:45:59.120 align:start position:0%
really good example right the mil pond
 
04:46:01.390 --> 04:46:01.400 align:start position:0%
in Durham which Durham already owns that
 
04:46:03.910 --> 04:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
that damn but they went through this
 
04:46:06.750 --> 04:46:06.760 align:start position:0%
debate about do we do we keep it do we
 
04:46:08.788 --> 04:46:08.798 align:start position:0%
keep the dam and restore it at very high
 
04:46:11.628 --> 04:46:11.638 align:start position:0%
cost because it was also in in in bad
 
04:46:14.190 --> 04:46:14.200 align:start position:0%
condition or do we remove it and and I
 
04:46:15.948 --> 04:46:15.958 align:start position:0%
think the Department's position on dam
 
04:46:18.390 --> 04:46:18.400 align:start position:0%
removal has been that it really There
 
04:46:20.070 --> 04:46:20.080 align:start position:0%
Are Places which it is an environmental
 
04:46:23.868 --> 04:46:23.878 align:start position:0%
benefit to do so hands down especially
 
04:46:25.830 --> 04:46:25.840 align:start position:0%
some of the head of Tide dams and some
 
04:46:27.350 --> 04:46:27.360 align:start position:0%
other places where fish passage is
 
04:46:30.270 --> 04:46:30.280 align:start position:0%
really important PCAT quag River happens
 
04:46:32.110 --> 04:46:32.120 align:start position:0%
to be one of those places because it is
 
04:46:33.470 --> 04:46:33.480 align:start position:0%
one of the places that the fish and
 
04:46:35.548 --> 04:46:35.558 align:start position:0%
wildlife service has suggested is one of
 
04:46:38.310 --> 04:46:38.320 align:start position:0%
the best Fisheries restoration uh
 
04:46:41.350 --> 04:46:41.360 align:start position:0%
opportunities in the Northeast so again
 
04:46:43.270 --> 04:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
there's a good opportunity that that
 
04:46:45.830 --> 04:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
said it has also been our our our
 
04:46:47.350 --> 04:46:47.360 align:start position:0%
recognition that these and if you look
 
04:46:49.868 --> 04:46:49.878 align:start position:0%
at the mission in of all of our damn you
 
04:46:52.910 --> 04:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
know our damn statutes it does Focus
 
04:46:55.110 --> 04:46:55.120 align:start position:0%
again on those human uses as well so if
 
04:46:56.390 --> 04:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
this is not the time at which we're
 
04:46:58.470 --> 04:46:58.480 align:start position:0%
going to R remove that Dam you know
 
04:47:00.548 --> 04:47:00.558 align:start position:0%
that's okay that's a decision that has
 
04:47:03.510 --> 04:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
to be made as a as a community and so I
 
04:47:06.590 --> 04:47:06.600 align:start position:0%
I think that there's going to be the the
 
04:47:08.990 --> 04:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
the conflict that you described is
 
04:47:11.830 --> 04:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
possible but unlikely because there are
 
04:47:14.590 --> 04:47:14.600 align:start position:0%
so few dams that get removed anyway um
 
04:47:17.230 --> 04:47:17.240 align:start position:0%
for any reason so I think it's a an
 
04:47:19.548 --> 04:47:19.558 align:start position:0%
unlikely position but it is it certainly
 
04:47:21.030 --> 04:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
is a
 
04:47:23.708 --> 04:47:23.718 align:start position:0%
possibility and there are ways around um
 
04:47:25.150 --> 04:47:25.160 align:start position:0%
providing some of those Wildlife
 
04:47:27.390 --> 04:47:27.400 align:start position:0%
benefits without removing the dam there
 
04:47:28.708 --> 04:47:28.718 align:start position:0%
can be fish ladders there could be
 
04:47:30.708 --> 04:47:30.718 align:start position:0%
nature-like fishways exitor is a good
 
04:47:32.628 --> 04:47:32.638 align:start position:0%
example we retained part of that
 
04:47:35.350 --> 04:47:35.360 align:start position:0%
empowerment but put in in a a a nature
 
04:47:37.628 --> 04:47:37.638 align:start position:0%
likee fish passage that looks like the
 
04:47:39.670 --> 04:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
stream that actually gets fish up and
 
04:47:41.430 --> 04:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
over it so there's a place where you
 
04:47:43.390 --> 04:47:43.400 align:start position:0%
could have your cake and eat it
 
04:47:47.030 --> 04:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
too okay follow your fish cake question
 
04:47:49.750 --> 04:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
yeah fish cake yes
 
04:47:54.470 --> 04:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
follow and do you does dees maintain
 
04:47:57.470 --> 04:47:57.480 align:start position:0%
some regulation over dams that are owned
 
04:48:00.350 --> 04:48:00.360 align:start position:0%
by towns or other people that's a great
 
04:48:02.030 --> 04:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
question and I want to emphatically say
 
04:48:04.990 --> 04:48:05.000 align:start position:0%
yes we have a whole series of of dam
 
04:48:07.948 --> 04:48:07.958 align:start position:0%
regulations which we apply not only to
 
04:48:12.270 --> 04:48:12.280 align:start position:0%
ourselves but to all of the 2600 dams in
 
04:48:15.030 --> 04:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
the state so there's about 2600 dams
 
04:48:16.470 --> 04:48:16.480 align:start position:0%
that we regulate in the state we
 
04:48:17.868 --> 04:48:17.878 align:start position:0%
regulate structures that are greater
 
04:48:21.670 --> 04:48:21.680 align:start position:0%
than 6 feet in height so um th those
 
04:48:24.708 --> 04:48:24.718 align:start position:0%
structures we do all all fall under the
 
04:48:27.190 --> 04:48:27.200 align:start position:0%
the the dam safety rules that we have
 
04:48:29.590 --> 04:48:29.600 align:start position:0%
they all get inspected by our inspectors
 
04:48:31.430 --> 04:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
they have a certain inspection schedule
 
04:48:33.628 --> 04:48:33.638 align:start position:0%
that they have to go in based on their
 
04:48:36.190 --> 04:48:36.200 align:start position:0%
likely Hood their their their risk that
 
04:48:37.788 --> 04:48:37.798 align:start position:0%
they that CA that if they were to fail
 
04:48:40.270 --> 04:48:40.280 align:start position:0%
something bad would happen all of that
 
04:48:43.190 --> 04:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
plays out regardless of who owns the
 
04:48:45.910 --> 04:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
dam thank you you
 
04:48:49.350 --> 04:48:49.360 align:start position:0%
that representative Iran thank you Mr
 
04:48:50.948 --> 04:48:50.958 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you Mr dear for taking
 
04:48:54.670 --> 04:48:54.680 align:start position:0%
my question um when uh representative PL
 
04:48:58.310 --> 04:48:58.320 align:start position:0%
was testifying I had asked him if um in
 
04:49:01.868 --> 04:49:01.878 align:start position:0%
lie of accessing the loan revolving fund
 
04:49:04.110 --> 04:49:04.120 align:start position:0%
if a town could take out a bond for the
 
04:49:06.990 --> 04:49:07.000 align:start position:0%
maintenance and when you or repairs and
 
04:49:09.510 --> 04:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
when you were speaking about the various
 
04:49:14.350 --> 04:49:14.360 align:start position:0%
banks that Dees runs I got the sense it
 
04:49:17.830 --> 04:49:17.840 align:start position:0%
wasn't something that's fun for you uh
 
04:49:22.270 --> 04:49:22.280 align:start position:0%
with Dees and um and that and then also
 
04:49:23.990 --> 04:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of it's takes a lot of
 
04:49:27.590 --> 04:49:27.600 align:start position:0%
time and a lot of engineering to I guess
 
04:49:29.788 --> 04:49:29.798 align:start position:0%
evaluate any loan
 
04:49:35.590 --> 04:49:35.600 align:start position:0%
proposals um so what why wouldn't
 
04:49:38.510 --> 04:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
Dees um I mean would they prefer just a
 
04:49:41.230 --> 04:49:41.240 align:start position:0%
town go on their own to raise the money
 
04:49:44.708 --> 04:49:44.718 align:start position:0%
for the for the loan through a bond um
 
04:49:48.030 --> 04:49:48.040 align:start position:0%
especially if if it takes some time um
 
04:49:50.708 --> 04:49:50.718 align:start position:0%
they would it wouldn't require DS to do
 
04:49:54.110 --> 04:49:54.120 align:start position:0%
the engineering but I suppose in the
 
04:49:56.470 --> 04:49:56.480 align:start position:0%
cost of the loan they would it would
 
04:49:59.350 --> 04:49:59.360 align:start position:0%
require obviously some project
 
04:50:01.190 --> 04:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
design I don't know I'm just kind of
 
04:50:04.270 --> 04:50:04.280 align:start position:0%
wondering if if if a town has those two
 
04:50:06.708 --> 04:50:06.718 align:start position:0%
options right what would the pr
 
04:50:09.310 --> 04:50:09.320 align:start position:0%
preference be from your perspective
 
04:50:12.150 --> 04:50:12.160 align:start position:0%
thank you representative it's um it's
 
04:50:14.788 --> 04:50:14.798 align:start position:0%
it's uh honestly the legislature rarely
 
04:50:16.230 --> 04:50:16.240 align:start position:0%
asks us to something this is what we'd
 
04:50:20.150 --> 04:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
like to do um so it's not really a
 
04:50:23.470 --> 04:50:23.480 align:start position:0%
question of liking or not liking um if
 
04:50:25.030 --> 04:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
this is if the state determines that
 
04:50:28.030 --> 04:50:28.040 align:start position:0%
this is great policy Direction our cons
 
04:50:29.910 --> 04:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
my concern again and I I sort of am in
 
04:50:32.350 --> 04:50:32.360 align:start position:0%
charge of budgets and people uh at the
 
04:50:35.788 --> 04:50:35.798 align:start position:0%
Water Division and so my concern
 
04:50:38.830 --> 04:50:38.840 align:start position:0%
immediately becomes how do we staff it
 
04:50:40.470 --> 04:50:40.480 align:start position:0%
how do we make sure that we're doing a
 
04:50:42.628 --> 04:50:42.638 align:start position:0%
good job for the state and in in because
 
04:50:44.310 --> 04:50:44.320 align:start position:0%
we are then responsible for shepherding
 
04:50:46.270 --> 04:50:46.280 align:start position:0%
those dollars and we take that very
 
04:50:48.470 --> 04:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
seriously and and I if I said it makes
 
04:50:52.390 --> 04:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
it sound not fun I only um say that the
 
04:50:54.868 --> 04:50:54.878 align:start position:0%
way I was describing it is that it is a
 
04:50:56.910 --> 04:50:56.920 align:start position:0%
it is a serious responsibility one that
 
04:50:59.628 --> 04:50:59.638 align:start position:0%
we take very seriously I love our
 
04:51:01.868 --> 04:51:01.878 align:start position:0%
revolving loan funds don't get me wrong
 
04:51:04.350 --> 04:51:04.360 align:start position:0%
they have done we've done 30 we've done
 
04:51:07.190 --> 04:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
over we've done billions of dollars of
 
04:51:10.070 --> 04:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
loans that continue to fund amazing
 
04:51:11.350 --> 04:51:11.360 align:start position:0%
projects in our drinking water and
 
04:51:13.948 --> 04:51:13.958 align:start position:0%
wastewater projects these this this
 
04:51:15.708 --> 04:51:15.718 align:start position:0%
state revolving fund stuff has been
 
04:51:17.868 --> 04:51:17.878 align:start position:0%
really amazing for the state and allows
 
04:51:20.350 --> 04:51:20.360 align:start position:0%
us a lot of flexibility on how we go
 
04:51:22.310 --> 04:51:22.320 align:start position:0%
about doing things that's the advantage
 
04:51:24.270 --> 04:51:24.280 align:start position:0%
of the state having a revolving fund is
 
04:51:26.510 --> 04:51:26.520 align:start position:0%
that outside of a municipal Bond we have
 
04:51:28.750 --> 04:51:28.760 align:start position:0%
a lot more flexibility to be able to to
 
04:51:30.750 --> 04:51:30.760 align:start position:0%
deal with a municipality in different
 
04:51:33.390 --> 04:51:33.400 align:start position:0%
ways than say the bond market does no
 
04:51:34.788 --> 04:51:34.798 align:start position:0%
that would be link to the bond market
 
04:51:36.430 --> 04:51:36.440 align:start position:0%
because the interest rate has to be
 
04:51:38.548 --> 04:51:38.558 align:start position:0%
somehow set we try not to be in
 
04:51:40.788 --> 04:51:40.798 align:start position:0%
competition necessarily with the outside
 
04:51:43.070 --> 04:51:43.080 align:start position:0%
world but we definitely want our
 
04:51:44.430 --> 04:51:44.440 align:start position:0%
communities to be able to get the best
 
04:51:48.470 --> 04:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
deal possible now so so anyway I I I
 
04:51:50.270 --> 04:51:50.280 align:start position:0%
want to just make sure and this is why
 
04:51:51.390 --> 04:51:51.400 align:start position:0%
you know some of the like we wouldn't
 
04:51:53.868 --> 04:51:53.878 align:start position:0%
start doing loans until we got to about
 
04:51:56.190 --> 04:51:56.200 align:start position:0%
200 you know 2.5 million it's not worth
 
04:51:58.510 --> 04:51:58.520 align:start position:0%
it um it's not worth the staff time to
 
04:52:00.628 --> 04:52:00.638 align:start position:0%
try to get to that point uh that I put
 
04:52:02.470 --> 04:52:02.480 align:start position:0%
in some dollars for administrative costs
 
04:52:04.830 --> 04:52:04.840 align:start position:0%
again it takes people to do these kinds
 
04:52:07.150 --> 04:52:07.160 align:start position:0%
of things so you know that's the kind of
 
04:52:09.510 --> 04:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
thing that might would be my concern if
 
04:52:12.590 --> 04:52:12.600 align:start position:0%
the legislature discerns that this is
 
04:52:14.830 --> 04:52:14.840 align:start position:0%
you know the a key policy Initiative for
 
04:52:17.390 --> 04:52:17.400 align:start position:0%
the state and somehow uh the good folks
 
04:52:19.548 --> 04:52:19.558 align:start position:0%
in in Ways and Means are able to find
 
04:52:21.548 --> 04:52:21.558 align:start position:0%
the the pennies under the seat cushions
 
04:52:24.430 --> 04:52:24.440 align:start position:0%
to fund it that's great um I don't think
 
04:52:25.628 --> 04:52:25.638 align:start position:0%
that you know I don't I don't think that
 
04:52:27.628 --> 04:52:27.638 align:start position:0%
that's it's not something that is going
 
04:52:30.430 --> 04:52:30.440 align:start position:0%
to be a problem we know how to do
 
04:52:30.440 --> 04:52:32.230 align:start position:0%
to be a problem we know how to do
that

04:52:32.230 --> 04:52:32.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:52:35.788 --> 04:52:35.798 align:start position:0%
sure represent of Darby thank you Mr
 
04:52:37.430 --> 04:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my
 
04:52:42.030 --> 04:52:42.040 align:start position:0%
question so um section one of this bill
 
04:52:44.190 --> 04:52:44.200 align:start position:0%
talks about both
 
04:52:46.868 --> 04:52:46.878 align:start position:0%
municipalities as well as I think I saw
 
04:52:50.230 --> 04:52:50.240 align:start position:0%
yeah um other um associations of land
 
04:52:51.830 --> 04:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
owners or interested
 
04:52:56.868 --> 04:52:56.878 align:start position:0%
parties section um four on or sorry
 
04:52:59.670 --> 04:52:59.680 align:start position:0%
under section two and sub paragraph four
 
04:53:02.150 --> 04:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
right it sort of talks about um the
 
04:53:04.350 --> 04:53:04.360 align:start position:0%
qualifications yep but really it talks
 
04:53:06.750 --> 04:53:06.760 align:start position:0%
about property taxes which I think only
 
04:53:07.750 --> 04:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
applies to
 
04:53:10.350 --> 04:53:10.360 align:start position:0%
municipalities or or Village districts
 
04:53:13.708 --> 04:53:13.718 align:start position:0%
or other things that can raise taxes or
 
04:53:18.948 --> 04:53:18.958 align:start position:0%
right um so my general question um so
 
04:53:21.070 --> 04:53:21.080 align:start position:0%
I'm a little nervous that the it doesn't
 
04:53:23.990 --> 04:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
talk about how how these associations of
 
04:53:27.230 --> 04:53:27.240 align:start position:0%
landowners are going to be vetted but my
 
04:53:30.390 --> 04:53:30.400 align:start position:0%
broader question is you you started by
 
04:53:32.548 --> 04:53:32.558 align:start position:0%
describing how expensive it is to
 
04:53:34.390 --> 04:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
maintain these damps
 
04:53:36.030 --> 04:53:36.040 align:start position:0%
and it's one thing to sort of repair it
 
04:53:37.788 --> 04:53:37.798 align:start position:0%
get the loan to repair it but then it
 
04:53:38.910 --> 04:53:38.920 align:start position:0%
seems like they have to be maintained
 
04:53:41.590 --> 04:53:41.600 align:start position:0%
over time and so if either the
 
04:53:44.830 --> 04:53:44.840 align:start position:0%
municipality or the um landowner
 
04:53:47.270 --> 04:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
Association sort of runs out of money
 
04:53:50.110 --> 04:53:50.120 align:start position:0%
like who's responsible what happens yeah
 
04:53:51.350 --> 04:53:51.360 align:start position:0%
I think it's a really good question
 
04:53:54.510 --> 04:53:54.520 align:start position:0%
representative uh Darby the um you know
 
04:53:55.990 --> 04:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
this is something that we have problems
 
04:53:59.948 --> 04:53:59.958 align:start position:0%
with around the state uh we have had uh
 
04:54:03.990 --> 04:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
itinerant Dam owners um that have
 
04:54:05.670 --> 04:54:05.680 align:start position:0%
essentially we have corporations that
 
04:54:07.948 --> 04:54:07.958 align:start position:0%
essentially folded went bankrupt and we
 
04:54:09.670 --> 04:54:09.680 align:start position:0%
have and there's Dam liability sitting
 
04:54:13.070 --> 04:54:13.080 align:start position:0%
around um what has happened in the past
 
04:54:16.868 --> 04:54:16.878 align:start position:0%
is that Dees has a a statute which
 
04:54:20.270 --> 04:54:20.280 align:start position:0%
allows us to go in and render that
 
04:54:23.430 --> 04:54:23.440 align:start position:0%
facility to be um sort of take take the
 
04:54:26.030 --> 04:54:26.040 align:start position:0%
risk out of that facility so we would
 
04:54:28.110 --> 04:54:28.120 align:start position:0%
either open up the gates permanently
 
04:54:30.150 --> 04:54:30.160 align:start position:0%
depending on the size of the of the the
 
04:54:32.548 --> 04:54:32.558 align:start position:0%
facility so it would just run as as the
 
04:54:35.750 --> 04:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
river so it wouldn't have to be managed
 
04:54:37.350 --> 04:54:37.360 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't and we would just get it to
 
04:54:40.990 --> 04:54:41.000 align:start position:0%
a state in which it was acceptable um if
 
04:54:43.868 --> 04:54:43.878 align:start position:0%
it was a a facility that say had some
 
04:54:46.670 --> 04:54:46.680 align:start position:0%
Wildlife value or something like that we
 
04:54:49.430 --> 04:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
would probably go out and try to seek um
 
04:54:51.830 --> 04:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
grant funding or something to remove it
 
04:54:53.430 --> 04:54:53.440 align:start position:0%
but there's a chance that it could
 
04:54:56.990 --> 04:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
result this that that if a if a town
 
04:54:58.868 --> 04:54:58.878 align:start position:0%
it's hard to imagine town going out of
 
04:55:01.390 --> 04:55:01.400 align:start position:0%
business but if a Lake Association or
 
04:55:03.590 --> 04:55:03.600 align:start position:0%
something like that took on one of these
 
04:55:05.390 --> 04:55:05.400 align:start position:0%
it's possible it could end up being a
 
04:55:05.400 --> 04:55:10.430 align:start position:0%
it's possible it could end up being a
state

04:55:10.430 --> 04:55:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:12.350 --> 04:55:12.360 align:start position:0%
responsibility any other question for
 
04:55:12.360 --> 04:55:14.270 align:start position:0%
responsibility any other question for
our

04:55:14.270 --> 04:55:14.280 align:start position:0%

thank you um my name is Jim Craig I'm a
 
04:55:55.548 --> 04:55:55.558 align:start position:0%
um gtown selectman I'm not here
 
04:55:57.788 --> 04:55:57.798 align:start position:0%
representing the the select board I'm
 
04:56:00.350 --> 04:56:00.360 align:start position:0%
here on my own um just as a way of
 
04:56:04.270 --> 04:56:04.280 align:start position:0%
background I sat with you for
 
04:56:06.548 --> 04:56:06.558 align:start position:0%
10 years or so in the Judiciary
 
04:56:09.750 --> 04:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
Committee and uh back back in the day
 
04:56:11.470 --> 04:56:11.480 align:start position:0%
and it's nice to be here with all of you
 
04:56:14.070 --> 04:56:14.080 align:start position:0%
and nice to be sitting here uh brings
 
04:56:16.430 --> 04:56:16.440 align:start position:0%
back a lot of old memories um I wasn't
 
04:56:17.830 --> 04:56:17.840 align:start position:0%
going to speak when I came up I was
 
04:56:21.708 --> 04:56:21.718 align:start position:0%
going to listen and support but uh I
 
04:56:23.670 --> 04:56:23.680 align:start position:0%
used to I I lived in Manchester most of
 
04:56:25.150 --> 04:56:25.160 align:start position:0%
my life and four or five years ago I
 
04:56:28.788 --> 04:56:28.798 align:start position:0%
moved to gtown and uh and I really love
 
04:56:32.230 --> 04:56:32.240 align:start position:0%
it there and uh just to give you some
 
04:56:36.390 --> 04:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
perspective on this uh back in maybe
 
04:56:39.510 --> 04:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
September October or November no
 
04:56:42.788 --> 04:56:42.798 align:start position:0%
probably October um we were at a meeting
 
04:56:47.190 --> 04:56:47.200 align:start position:0%
of Select select board and uh and it was
 
04:56:50.470 --> 04:56:50.480 align:start position:0%
and Dees at that point told us that they
 
04:56:52.948 --> 04:56:52.958 align:start position:0%
were withdrawing um their ownership of
 
04:56:55.750 --> 04:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
the dam the hadly fall Dam now I don't
 
04:56:57.390 --> 04:56:57.400 align:start position:0%
know if you if you're familiar with go
 
04:57:00.788 --> 04:57:00.798 align:start position:0%
sound but it centers um on the pascas
 
04:57:04.670 --> 04:57:04.680 align:start position:0%
squar river and it's a probably 100 in a
 
04:57:07.030 --> 04:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
length of a football field wide and
 
04:57:09.990 --> 04:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
that's where we have all our pumpkin V
 
04:57:12.230 --> 04:57:12.240 align:start position:0%
and all that stuff matter of fact
 
04:57:15.708 --> 04:57:15.718 align:start position:0%
there's a ad hoc Committee in town um
 
04:57:18.070 --> 04:57:18.080 align:start position:0%
which is charged with putting a foot
 
04:57:20.430 --> 04:57:20.440 align:start position:0%
bridge that fell that that burned down
 
04:57:23.948 --> 04:57:23.958 align:start position:0%
years ago back over the um over the the
 
04:57:29.430 --> 04:57:29.440 align:start position:0%
uh River and uh and then um in O again I
 
04:57:31.310 --> 04:57:31.320 align:start position:0%
think don't I'm not don't quote me but
 
04:57:35.030 --> 04:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
October maybe um we were told that
 
04:57:37.270 --> 04:57:37.280 align:start position:0%
um they're they're going to the the the
 
04:57:41.030 --> 04:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
dam is coming down and uh we're all
 
04:57:43.910 --> 04:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
sitting there dumbfounded um you know
 
04:57:45.910 --> 04:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
part of it was I don't think it was done
 
04:57:47.670 --> 04:57:47.680 align:start position:0%
very well but the part part of the
 
04:57:50.270 --> 04:57:50.280 align:start position:0%
things I like in this bill is at least a
 
04:57:53.190 --> 04:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
year we get at least a year notice um
 
04:57:56.548 --> 04:57:56.558 align:start position:0%
because can you imagine trying to you
 
04:57:59.030 --> 04:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
know uh figure out what's going to
 
04:58:01.030 --> 04:58:01.040 align:start position:0%
happen who's going to own and we were
 
04:58:05.150 --> 04:58:05.160 align:start position:0%
told that um the river was going to
 
04:58:07.948 --> 04:58:07.958 align:start position:0%
shrink probably from you know the length
 
04:58:10.510 --> 04:58:10.520 align:start position:0%
of a football field to you know more
 
04:58:13.510 --> 04:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
like a river maybe 15 20 feet long you
 
04:58:15.708 --> 04:58:15.718 align:start position:0%
know and put a bridge over something
 
04:58:17.990 --> 04:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
like that and all kinds of practical
 
04:58:22.830 --> 04:58:22.840 align:start position:0%
things uh became problems and um there
 
04:58:25.270 --> 04:58:25.280 align:start position:0%
there's a um there's a development right
 
04:58:28.430 --> 04:58:28.440 align:start position:0%
next to Hadley Falls uh with I think
 
04:58:30.708 --> 04:58:30.718 align:start position:0%
almost a 100 units coming in their uh
 
04:58:33.470 --> 04:58:33.480 align:start position:0%
apartments and uh and it's it's called
 
04:58:36.708 --> 04:58:36.718 align:start position:0%
Hadley Hadley Falls Dam's apartments and
 
04:58:38.750 --> 04:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
uh there won't be a Falls there anymore
 
04:58:41.190 --> 04:58:41.200 align:start position:0%
all those all those kind of things um
 
04:58:44.350 --> 04:58:44.360 align:start position:0%
were just dropped on us and uh we were
 
04:58:46.990 --> 04:58:47.000 align:start position:0%
told that it may take uh six or seven
 
04:58:50.590 --> 04:58:50.600 align:start position:0%
years uh before the dam comes down um we
 
04:58:54.150 --> 04:58:54.160 align:start position:0%
had a ton of questions um and no answers
 
04:58:55.990 --> 04:58:56.000 align:start position:0%
um other than we're going to do all the
 
04:58:58.548 --> 04:58:58.558 align:start position:0%
work necessary to find the answers like
 
04:58:59.948 --> 04:58:59.958 align:start position:0%
who's going to own the who's going to
 
04:59:02.708 --> 04:59:02.718 align:start position:0%
own the land in you know that's no
 
04:59:05.628 --> 04:59:05.638 align:start position:0%
longer under the water um what what's
 
04:59:07.310 --> 04:59:07.320 align:start position:0%
going to happen to it um how much is
 
04:59:10.310 --> 04:59:10.320 align:start position:0%
there going to be um you know all those
 
04:59:11.910 --> 04:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
kind of things uh that we didn't have
 
04:59:15.670 --> 04:59:15.680 align:start position:0%
answers to and so um you know we still
 
04:59:17.310 --> 04:59:17.320 align:start position:0%
don't that you know we we're still
 
04:59:19.990 --> 04:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
waiting for some of those um those tests
 
04:59:23.150 --> 04:59:23.160 align:start position:0%
and and um reports to come back uh to
 
04:59:25.110 --> 04:59:25.120 align:start position:0%
see how much it would cost actually cost
 
04:59:27.390 --> 04:59:27.400 align:start position:0%
to repair it um some people would like
 
04:59:29.830 --> 04:59:29.840 align:start position:0%
to repair it um I don't think it's I
 
04:59:31.628 --> 04:59:31.638 align:start position:0%
think it's going to be cost prohibitive
 
04:59:33.990 --> 04:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
um and again I don't speak for the board
 
04:59:36.830 --> 04:59:36.840 align:start position:0%
speak for myself here um but I just kind
 
04:59:38.788 --> 04:59:38.798 align:start position:0%
of wanted to give you a flavor on what
 
04:59:40.830 --> 04:59:40.840 align:start position:0%
could happen happen to us could happen
 
04:59:44.270 --> 04:59:44.280 align:start position:0%
to you your towns um and uh one thing
 
04:59:45.948 --> 04:59:45.958 align:start position:0%
that I like and and I would if you're
 
04:59:49.150 --> 04:59:49.160 align:start position:0%
going to move forward with this um in
 
04:59:51.390 --> 04:59:51.400 align:start position:0%
the first paragraph on line four it says
 
04:59:53.830 --> 04:59:53.840 align:start position:0%
at least one year prior to removing the
 
04:59:57.230 --> 04:59:57.240 align:start position:0%
dam uh the process takes about I'm told
 
05:00:00.270 --> 05:00:00.280 align:start position:0%
six or seven years um
 
05:00:03.590 --> 05:00:03.600 align:start position:0%
so it may be esoteric but um prior to
 
05:00:05.510 --> 05:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
beginning I would prefer it to say prior
 
05:00:09.230 --> 05:00:09.240 align:start position:0%
to REM beginning the process of removing
 
05:00:11.990 --> 05:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
um so we and not you know a year because
 
05:00:14.510 --> 05:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
if you read this technically and uh it's
 
05:00:17.750 --> 05:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
what I used to do so um you know they
 
05:00:19.708 --> 05:00:19.718 align:start position:0%
could wait until this one year left and
 
05:00:22.270 --> 05:00:22.280 align:start position:0%
then then offer it to us um and the
 
05:00:25.470 --> 05:00:25.480 align:start position:0%
other thing that so I I you know that
 
05:00:26.868 --> 05:00:26.878 align:start position:0%
that's one thing that caught my eye and
 
05:00:29.310 --> 05:00:29.320 align:start position:0%
the other thing that that's good is U
 
05:00:30.948 --> 05:00:30.958 align:start position:0%
you know we would get a year each town
 
05:00:32.708 --> 05:00:32.718 align:start position:0%
would get at least a year to to think
 
05:00:34.190 --> 05:00:34.200 align:start position:0%
about about all these things and figure
 
05:00:35.590 --> 05:00:35.600 align:start position:0%
out whether it's possible what's
 
05:00:38.270 --> 05:00:38.280 align:start position:0%
possible and what's not possible and uh
 
05:00:41.070 --> 05:00:41.080 align:start position:0%
you know we're given uh paragraph 3
 
05:00:45.110 --> 05:00:45.120 align:start position:0%
Roman 3 um we would be provided with all
 
05:00:46.868 --> 05:00:46.878 align:start position:0%
documentation and things so that we can
 
05:00:49.270 --> 05:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
make you know get Engineers or whatever
 
05:00:51.830 --> 05:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
and make um intelligent choices on you
 
05:00:52.830 --> 05:00:52.840 align:start position:0%
know what are we going to bring to the
 
05:00:55.150 --> 05:00:55.160 align:start position:0%
voters and what um this is this has
 
05:00:58.470 --> 05:00:58.480 align:start position:0%
resulted in um a couple of
 
05:01:02.110 --> 05:01:02.120 align:start position:0%
uh uh public hearings and uh the dees
 
05:01:04.070 --> 05:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
has been very cooperative and come down
 
05:01:06.788 --> 05:01:06.798 align:start position:0%
explained everybody's um everybody's
 
05:01:08.628 --> 05:01:08.638 align:start position:0%
questions and uh the public hearing is
 
05:01:11.990 --> 05:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
probably what 100 to 200 people appeared
 
05:01:14.150 --> 05:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
and it's a Maj you know it's a big deal
 
05:01:19.270 --> 05:01:19.280 align:start position:0%
in our town um I get I understand um the
 
05:01:21.110 --> 05:01:21.120 align:start position:0%
reasons that Dees is doing what it's
 
05:01:23.510 --> 05:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
doing um but I'm asking for some
 
05:01:25.670 --> 05:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
consideration for the towns and as you
 
05:01:28.230 --> 05:01:28.240 align:start position:0%
heard there's you know 200 uh and and
 
05:01:30.030 --> 05:01:30.040 align:start position:0%
you know most of the dams I guess are
 
05:01:30.040 --> 05:01:31.030 align:start position:0%
you know most of the dams I guess are
not

05:01:31.030 --> 05:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:01:33.948 --> 05:01:33.958 align:start position:0%
um they're not as up front as this one
 
05:01:35.230 --> 05:01:35.240 align:start position:0%
is this one's right in the middle of
 
05:01:38.150 --> 05:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
town and and it and it's going to affect
 
05:01:40.270 --> 05:01:40.280 align:start position:0%
um the character of the town no matter
 
05:01:43.868 --> 05:01:43.878 align:start position:0%
what happens um so so I just wanted you
 
05:01:45.830 --> 05:01:45.840 align:start position:0%
to provide a little background of why
 
05:01:48.510 --> 05:01:48.520 align:start position:0%
this came up and uh there's got to be a
 
05:01:53.150 --> 05:01:53.160 align:start position:0%
better way to do this so with that um
 
05:01:54.910 --> 05:01:54.920 align:start position:0%
entertain any questions if there are any
 
05:01:58.270 --> 05:01:58.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:00.590 --> 05:02:00.600 align:start position:0%
speaker don't see any so thank you for
 
05:02:02.830 --> 05:02:02.840 align:start position:0%
your testimony is there anyone else that
 
05:02:04.670 --> 05:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
wants to speak on
 
05:02:07.708 --> 05:02:07.718 align:start position:0%
1429 I'll ask one more time anyone else
 
05:02:10.350 --> 05:02:10.360 align:start position:0%
to speak on 1429 seeing no one
 
05:02:12.868 --> 05:02:12.878 align:start position:0%
approaching the stand I'll close the
 
05:02:16.670 --> 05:02:16.680 align:start position:0%
hearing on hb1 1429
 
05:02:21.070 --> 05:02:21.080 align:start position:0%
FNA and I'll ask for any pink cards on
 
05:02:21.080 --> 05:02:22.948 align:start position:0%
FNA and I'll ask for any pink cards on
hb1

05:02:22.948 --> 05:02:22.958 align:start position:0%
hb1
 
05:02:27.910 --> 05:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
1477 FN I'll open the hearing on
 
05:02:31.830 --> 05:02:31.840 align:start position:0%
1477 FN relative to environmental shity
 
05:02:34.190 --> 05:02:34.200 align:start position:0%

05:02:39.230 --> 05:02:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:41.430 --> 05:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
resources and I think we're going to get
 
05:03:01.670 --> 05:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:01.680 --> 05:03:04.628 align:start position:0%
 
minute

05:03:17.270 --> 05:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
there I should have asked while we're
 
05:03:20.868 --> 05:03:20.878 align:start position:0%
waiting for the pink cards can maybe
 
05:03:22.788 --> 05:03:22.798 align:start position:0%
representative Darby can you grab the
 
05:03:24.830 --> 05:03:24.840 align:start position:0%
blue sheets on
 
05:03:30.310 --> 05:03:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:34.708 --> 05:03:34.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:37.948 --> 05:03:37.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:41.070 --> 05:03:41.080 align:start position:0%
back if you just give us a count for and
 
05:03:44.150 --> 05:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
against if there's any on it none okay
 
05:03:44.160 --> 05:03:56.990 align:start position:0%
against if there's any on it none okay
that's

05:03:56.990 --> 05:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:02.150 --> 05:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
easy9 89 for two against 89 for two
 
05:04:02.160 --> 05:04:24.030 align:start position:0%

05:04:31.558 --> 05:04:35.750 align:start position:0%
 
idea

05:04:35.750 --> 05:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:38.270 --> 05:04:38.280 align:start position:0%
so opening the hearing on hb1

floor that's a z and that's a t I'm not

floor that's a z and that's a t I'm not
CCT

05:05:07.510 --> 05:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:09.150 --> 05:05:09.160 align:start position:0%
sorry I didn't see it and then I was
 
05:05:10.548 --> 05:05:10.558 align:start position:0%
thinking that it wasn't here and then I
 
05:05:12.150 --> 05:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
went in the hallway and panicked and
 
05:05:13.590 --> 05:05:13.600 align:start position:0%
thinking it wasn't in this room and I'm
 
05:05:15.868 --> 05:05:15.878 align:start position:0%
like I know it said this so um my name
 
05:05:18.270 --> 05:05:18.280 align:start position:0%
is representative Kelly Penza from
 
05:05:21.628 --> 05:05:21.638 align:start position:0%
straford District 19 um I'm the sponsor
 
05:05:26.270 --> 05:05:26.280 align:start position:0%
of this bill uh so I put this in
 
05:05:29.510 --> 05:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
actually um not truly understanding to
 
05:05:32.150 --> 05:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
the extent of I knew a little bit but
 
05:05:34.230 --> 05:05:34.240 align:start position:0%
not enough and um this was through
 
05:05:36.708 --> 05:05:36.718 align:start position:0%
several constituents so you know just
 
05:05:38.590 --> 05:05:38.600 align:start position:0%
for everybody that might not be aware
 
05:05:41.910 --> 05:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
what an environmental security bond is
 
05:05:44.110 --> 05:05:44.120 align:start position:0%
um you know they're required there's
 
05:05:45.548 --> 05:05:45.558 align:start position:0%
required types of shity bonds that are
 
05:05:47.150 --> 05:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
needed for of course environmental
 
05:05:49.110 --> 05:05:49.120 align:start position:0%
contractors they're put in place to
 
05:05:51.110 --> 05:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
protect environmental Integrity when
 
05:05:52.750 --> 05:05:52.760 align:start position:0%
large or small construction projects
 
05:05:54.230 --> 05:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
involve any number of environmental
 
05:05:56.110 --> 05:05:56.120 align:start position:0%
risks they include performance and
 
05:05:57.788 --> 05:05:57.798 align:start position:0%
payment charity bonds when the
 
05:06:00.670 --> 05:06:00.680 align:start position:0%
contaminated property is being um
 
05:06:02.948 --> 05:06:02.958 align:start position:0%
remediated and of course license and
 
05:06:05.190 --> 05:06:05.200 align:start position:0%
permise bonds for it could be for
 
05:06:07.190 --> 05:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
landfills Wetland mitigation chemical
 
05:06:09.670 --> 05:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
plants plastic and rubber producers and
 
05:06:10.548 --> 05:06:10.558 align:start position:0%
on and
 
05:06:13.390 --> 05:06:13.400 align:start position:0%
on and other industries of course that
 
05:06:16.310 --> 05:06:16.320 align:start position:0%
impact uh the environment so
 
05:06:17.670 --> 05:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
environmental secy bonds really
 
05:06:19.510 --> 05:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
guarantee that the contractors and other
 
05:06:21.350 --> 05:06:21.360 align:start position:0%
service providers will comply with
 
05:06:23.548 --> 05:06:23.558 align:start position:0%
federal state and local regulations and
 
05:06:28.390 --> 05:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
environmental policies um in in so many
 
05:06:30.548 --> 05:06:30.558 align:start position:0%
in the smallest way or the
 
05:06:32.948 --> 05:06:32.958 align:start position:0%
uh um
 
05:06:34.788 --> 05:06:34.798 align:start position:0%
the most succinct way to say it it is
 
05:06:37.750 --> 05:06:37.760 align:start position:0%
actually putting um you know the the
 
05:06:40.110 --> 05:06:40.120 align:start position:0%
business The Entity they on the hook
 
05:06:42.030 --> 05:06:42.040 align:start position:0%
instead of the taxpayers and that's how
 
05:06:45.350 --> 05:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
it should be or the state so um so the
 
05:06:46.948 --> 05:06:46.958 align:start position:0%
state's not on the hook or the taxpayers
 
05:06:48.430 --> 05:06:48.440 align:start position:0%
not on the hook which really always
 
05:06:50.310 --> 05:06:50.320 align:start position:0%
comes down to the taxpayers so they're
 
05:06:52.390 --> 05:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
designed to prevent of course and um
 
05:06:55.030 --> 05:06:55.040 align:start position:0%
prevent or repair environmental damage
 
05:06:57.708 --> 05:06:57.718 align:start position:0%
by covering construction projects and ha
 
05:07:00.910 --> 05:07:00.920 align:start position:0%
hazardous materials um included in the
 
05:07:03.628 --> 05:07:03.638 align:start position:0%
bond term so like who needs this right
 
05:07:06.910 --> 05:07:06.920 align:start position:0%
um you know there's coal Burning uh
 
05:07:09.430 --> 05:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
storage facilities um usually have a
 
05:07:13.110 --> 05:07:13.120 align:start position:0%
closure Bond landfills usually have a sh
 
05:07:15.150 --> 05:07:15.160 align:start position:0%
there's different um different levels of
 
05:07:16.990 --> 05:07:17.000 align:start position:0%
bonds that you can get but a shity bond
 
05:07:19.590 --> 05:07:19.600 align:start position:0%
is one for the closing of the landfill
 
05:07:21.750 --> 05:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
um you know construction firms
 
05:07:22.708 --> 05:07:22.718 align:start position:0%
especially if they're going to be
 
05:07:25.150 --> 05:07:25.160 align:start position:0%
digging in any sort of dirt um that have
 
05:07:27.430 --> 05:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
environmental components asbest lead
 
05:07:30.830 --> 05:07:30.840 align:start position:0%
petrol chemicals um environmental
 
05:07:32.910 --> 05:07:32.920 align:start position:0%
remediation contractors who need that
 
05:07:35.788 --> 05:07:35.798 align:start position:0%
kind of like extra bonding capacity uh
 
05:07:38.070 --> 05:07:38.080 align:start position:0%
depending on what they find uh and then
 
05:07:40.030 --> 05:07:40.040 align:start position:0%
of course manufacturing companies whose
 
05:07:42.910 --> 05:07:42.920 align:start position:0%
processes generate byproducts that
 
05:07:45.590 --> 05:07:45.600 align:start position:0%
remain um that remain in residual
 
05:07:47.350 --> 05:07:47.360 align:start position:0%
landfills not in our landfills
 
05:07:49.948 --> 05:07:49.958 align:start position:0%
necessarily but um landfills that could
 
05:07:51.910 --> 05:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
be because of course most of our
 
05:07:53.350 --> 05:07:53.360 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste pretty much all of our
 
05:07:55.190 --> 05:07:55.200 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste in New Hampshire is
 
05:07:57.510 --> 05:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
we're paying for that to be
 
05:08:01.190 --> 05:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
removed and um you know just some things
 
05:08:04.350 --> 05:08:04.360 align:start position:0%
that uh shity Bond can cover uh esus
 
05:08:07.150 --> 05:08:07.160 align:start position:0%
removal contaminated material disposal
 
05:08:10.230 --> 05:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
uh sediment control soil remediation
 
05:08:12.670 --> 05:08:12.680 align:start position:0%
underground tank removal uh well plug
 
05:08:15.670 --> 05:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
and well plug and abandonment um I just
 
05:08:18.110 --> 05:08:18.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to speak on that one specifically
 
05:08:20.150 --> 05:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
since that has happened uh all
 
05:08:23.270 --> 05:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
throughout New Hampshire uh as um as
 
05:08:25.470 --> 05:08:25.480 align:start position:0%
everybody's probably aware well on our
 
05:08:27.470 --> 05:08:27.480 align:start position:0%
committee anyway I'm on environment and
 
05:08:30.830 --> 05:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
agriculture um and I think it was first
 
05:08:33.030 --> 05:08:33.040 align:start position:0%
discovered in the early 20 thousands in
 
05:08:35.390 --> 05:08:35.400 align:start position:0%
regards with peace Air Force Base and
 
05:08:37.070 --> 05:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
the level of pollution that has taken
 
05:08:38.948 --> 05:08:38.958 align:start position:0%
place there you know who's responsible
 
05:08:41.110 --> 05:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
of this is it the federal government is
 
05:08:43.628 --> 05:08:43.638 align:start position:0%
it is it the state entity um there's
 
05:08:46.030 --> 05:08:46.040 align:start position:0%
been many people impacted there are
 
05:08:49.390 --> 05:08:49.400 align:start position:0%
current still pending lawsuits um and
 
05:08:51.708 --> 05:08:51.718 align:start position:0%
there's tons of questions I mean most of
 
05:08:54.270 --> 05:08:54.280 align:start position:0%
these folks were were literally uh
 
05:08:57.270 --> 05:08:57.280 align:start position:0%
drinking tainted water bathing drinking
 
05:09:01.150 --> 05:09:01.160 align:start position:0%
cooking in it um for over a decade and
 
05:09:03.788 --> 05:09:03.798 align:start position:0%
uh in it in it SP and there's tons of
 
05:09:05.750 --> 05:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
Wells that are of course all
 
05:09:08.830 --> 05:09:08.840 align:start position:0%
decommissioned and have huge levels of
 
05:09:11.430 --> 05:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
not just the you know the the forever
 
05:09:12.708 --> 05:09:12.718 align:start position:0%
chemicals that we're talking about
 
05:09:15.310 --> 05:09:15.320 align:start position:0%
everybody's talking about poas uh p
 
05:09:17.990 --> 05:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
pfoas and stuff like that
 
05:09:21.190 --> 05:09:21.200 align:start position:0%
so this is just such the Smart M to move
 
05:09:24.548 --> 05:09:24.558 align:start position:0%
forward and I know that there's uh
 
05:09:27.190 --> 05:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
there's a couple issues with the bill
 
05:09:30.310 --> 05:09:30.320 align:start position:0%
that could definitely um be that that is
 
05:09:34.030 --> 05:09:34.040 align:start position:0%
no problem to have an amendment um the
 
05:09:35.990 --> 05:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
you know the commissioner came and and
 
05:09:39.190 --> 05:09:39.200 align:start position:0%
and you know came out and said that that
 
05:09:40.910 --> 05:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
he had some issues with the bill and I
 
05:09:42.310 --> 05:09:42.320 align:start position:0%
I'd like to talk about some of those
 
05:09:44.788 --> 05:09:44.798 align:start position:0%
issues because it looks as if he's you
 
05:09:47.030 --> 05:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
know acting as if this is putting them
 
05:09:48.910 --> 05:09:48.920 align:start position:0%
in a position where they're going to
 
05:09:51.670 --> 05:09:51.680 align:start position:0%
have to be responsible for for these
 
05:09:56.070 --> 05:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
things and it's this is um this provides
 
05:09:58.670 --> 05:09:58.680 align:start position:0%
funds to cover litigation that would
 
05:10:01.190 --> 05:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
lead to continuous litigation so the
 
05:10:03.910 --> 05:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
bill like in no way would change like
 
05:10:06.868 --> 05:10:06.878 align:start position:0%
prerequisites to file any kind of claim
 
05:10:08.708 --> 05:10:08.718 align:start position:0%
and that's stated in here and it that's
 
05:10:11.350 --> 05:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
just not true um it would also reduce
 
05:10:13.750 --> 05:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
the chance that taxpayers would end up
 
05:10:16.830 --> 05:10:16.840 align:start position:0%
having to foot the bill um for harms
 
05:10:19.948 --> 05:10:19.958 align:start position:0%
that you know like bankrupt or shell
 
05:10:22.830 --> 05:10:22.840 align:start position:0%
companies C that that you know shell
 
05:10:24.628 --> 05:10:24.638 align:start position:0%
companies that have caused and then we
 
05:10:26.628 --> 05:10:26.638 align:start position:0%
try to seek to avoid that I'm just going
 
05:10:29.470 --> 05:10:29.480 align:start position:0%
to give you an example um I'm going to
 
05:10:31.110 --> 05:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
use a I'm going to use waste management
 
05:10:32.670 --> 05:10:32.680 align:start position:0%
for example so
 
05:10:35.070 --> 05:10:35.080 align:start position:0%
uh or landfills so we you have waste
 
05:10:36.510 --> 05:10:36.520 align:start position:0%
management that is always underneath
 
05:10:38.510 --> 05:10:38.520 align:start position:0%
Waste Management their name and we have
 
05:10:41.430 --> 05:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
another private company that um
 
05:10:46.628 --> 05:10:46.638 align:start position:0%
literally creates uh multiple llc's so
 
05:10:48.750 --> 05:10:48.760 align:start position:0%
you can open up a landfill you close it
 
05:10:50.350 --> 05:10:50.360 align:start position:0%
you decommission it that business
 
05:10:52.230 --> 05:10:52.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist anymore they bankrupt it
 
05:10:54.190 --> 05:10:54.200 align:start position:0%
and it's all done and you can't get
 
05:10:56.430 --> 05:10:56.440 align:start position:0%
anything out of that and then it comes
 
05:10:59.110 --> 05:10:59.120 align:start position:0%
back to the EPA gets involved it becomes
 
05:11:01.270 --> 05:11:01.280 align:start position:0%
a super fund site and then the taxpayers
 
05:11:05.708 --> 05:11:05.718 align:start position:0%
are on the hook for that so in I'm going
 
05:11:10.070 --> 05:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
to grab some of my information here so
 
05:11:11.868 --> 05:11:11.878 align:start position:0%
in December of
 
05:11:15.948 --> 05:11:15.958 align:start position:0%
2013 that was um there were 20 super
 
05:11:18.190 --> 05:11:18.200 align:start position:0%
fund sites around the state that was 10
 
05:11:21.590 --> 05:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
years ago and there's many more um since
 
05:11:24.470 --> 05:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
then and you know once it's a super fund
 
05:11:26.670 --> 05:11:26.680 align:start position:0%
site it kind of stays that way forever
 
05:11:28.430 --> 05:11:28.440 align:start position:0%
and I could give lots of examples and
 
05:11:30.190 --> 05:11:30.200 align:start position:0%
I'm going to email you a bunch of my
 
05:11:31.948 --> 05:11:31.958 align:start position:0%
testimony because I have tons of attack
 
05:11:34.150 --> 05:11:34.160 align:start position:0%
attachments and just a lot of wealth of
 
05:11:36.230 --> 05:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
information where I've been researching
 
05:11:38.510 --> 05:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
for you can for you to understand how
 
05:11:41.110 --> 05:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
this is so necessary uh to have in the
 
05:11:44.830 --> 05:11:44.840 align:start position:0%
state but the tanneries they started
 
05:11:48.190 --> 05:11:48.200 align:start position:0%
polluting the state um in the early you
 
05:11:48.200 --> 05:11:49.110 align:start position:0%
polluting the state um in the early you
know

05:11:49.110 --> 05:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:11:53.350 --> 05:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
1950s and those areas are are never to
 
05:11:56.190 --> 05:11:56.200 align:start position:0%
be built upon like you're that's kind of
 
05:11:59.070 --> 05:11:59.080 align:start position:0%
dead land so once it's you know it's all
 
05:12:01.230 --> 05:12:01.240 align:start position:0%
monitored there's monitoring RS you know
 
05:12:03.590 --> 05:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
all you know um all around those
 
05:12:06.190 --> 05:12:06.200 align:start position:0%
properties but you know we can't you're
 
05:12:08.390 --> 05:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
not going to be able to build you know
 
05:12:12.150 --> 05:12:12.160 align:start position:0%
a a condo uh facility there or anything
 
05:12:15.548 --> 05:12:15.558 align:start position:0%
like that and as you know which was um
 
05:12:18.150 --> 05:12:18.160 align:start position:0%
in um which was in the house the last
 
05:12:20.750 --> 05:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
time the place up north uh the the
 
05:12:23.270 --> 05:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
logging Mill that was actually built on
 
05:12:24.670 --> 05:12:24.680 align:start position:0%
property that was kind of like dead
 
05:12:26.310 --> 05:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
property because it was where an old
 
05:12:30.070 --> 05:12:30.080 align:start position:0%
Tannery was as well um but you have
 
05:12:31.830 --> 05:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
there's a huge case of course that was
 
05:12:34.070 --> 05:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
was with the EPA that happened in naswa
 
05:12:36.830 --> 05:12:36.840 align:start position:0%
we're talking about in bosan in Penacook
 
05:12:40.190 --> 05:12:40.200 align:start position:0%
those tanneries um and we all know the
 
05:12:42.070 --> 05:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
one that's glaring right in front of us
 
05:12:45.990 --> 05:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
now which is St coob and um and I think
 
05:12:47.788 --> 05:12:47.798 align:start position:0%
what bothers me the most is that we knew
 
05:12:51.310 --> 05:12:51.320 align:start position:0%
in 2004 we knew it they they got their
 
05:12:54.350 --> 05:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
permit in 2000 and they bought that
 
05:12:56.910 --> 05:12:56.920 align:start position:0%
company from another Plastics Company
 
05:12:59.110 --> 05:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
and in 2004 we we knew there was a
 
05:13:00.948 --> 05:13:00.958 align:start position:0%
problem with the air we didn't do
 
05:13:05.030 --> 05:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
anything and and then um by 2016 we're
 
05:13:07.110 --> 05:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
realizing that people's Wells are
 
05:13:10.070 --> 05:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
contaminated over a thousand Wells now
 
05:13:12.150 --> 05:13:12.160 align:start position:0%
that has spread it's not just in marac
 
05:13:14.628 --> 05:13:14.638 align:start position:0%
it's maram it's Lichfield it's Hollis
 
05:13:16.510 --> 05:13:16.520 align:start position:0%
it's Bedford once things are in the
 
05:13:19.150 --> 05:13:19.160 align:start position:0%
water table um I had talked to a
 
05:13:22.190 --> 05:13:22.200 align:start position:0%
grandmother on the phone and you know
 
05:13:24.628 --> 05:13:24.638 align:start position:0%
she's uh she's riddled with tumors at
 
05:13:26.670 --> 05:13:26.680 align:start position:0%
this point uh she continued to drink the
 
05:13:29.948 --> 05:13:29.958 align:start position:0%
water and you know all that was provided
 
05:13:31.990 --> 05:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
was bottled water and they were were
 
05:13:33.830 --> 05:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
still fighting we got millions of
 
05:13:35.830 --> 05:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
dollars in this state and they were
 
05:13:40.430 --> 05:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
still fighting to get um like full whole
 
05:13:41.628 --> 05:13:41.638 align:start position:0%
you know water
 
05:13:44.350 --> 05:13:44.360 align:start position:0%
systems and that's mindboggling to me
 
05:13:46.830 --> 05:13:46.840 align:start position:0%
could you imagine living in a home you
 
05:13:49.910 --> 05:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
know a $500,000 home using bottled water
 
05:13:52.830 --> 05:13:52.840 align:start position:0%
for seven years like this stuff to me
 
05:13:54.750 --> 05:13:54.760 align:start position:0%
just doesn't make any sense and if
 
05:13:56.590 --> 05:13:56.600 align:start position:0%
there's a shity bond that was in place
 
05:13:57.868 --> 05:13:57.878 align:start position:0%
which I don't believe there is because
 
05:14:00.270 --> 05:14:00.280 align:start position:0%
what did they do s Cain is now Cut and
 
05:14:02.150 --> 05:14:02.160 align:start position:0%
Run and now we're going to try figure it
 
05:14:04.830 --> 05:14:04.840 align:start position:0%
out after the fact how many more years
 
05:14:07.310 --> 05:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
of these people's property that are you
 
05:14:08.948 --> 05:14:08.958 align:start position:0%
know nobody's going to want to buy that
 
05:14:10.910 --> 05:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
home if they want to if they want to
 
05:14:14.750 --> 05:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
sell it and a shity bond would actually
 
05:14:18.110 --> 05:14:18.120 align:start position:0%
um compensate of course the cleanup and
 
05:14:19.830 --> 05:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
and would be backed by all of that
 
05:14:21.150 --> 05:14:21.160 align:start position:0%
because they would have had it to begin
 
05:14:25.830 --> 05:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
with um Dees talks about uh you know
 
05:14:28.030 --> 05:14:28.040 align:start position:0%
having to get more staff and monitor and
 
05:14:30.868 --> 05:14:30.878 align:start position:0%
all of that there are I mean almost
 
05:14:32.350 --> 05:14:32.360 align:start position:0%
every single state
 
05:14:35.548 --> 05:14:35.558 align:start position:0%
has some level of this going on in their
 
05:14:38.510 --> 05:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
state um if you look on de's website
 
05:14:41.270 --> 05:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
they talk specifically about shity bonds
 
05:14:43.910 --> 05:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
um in regards with landfills and that
 
05:14:45.948 --> 05:14:45.958 align:start position:0%
you know they give different types of
 
05:14:48.590 --> 05:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
funding options that you could pick uh
 
05:14:51.350 --> 05:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
if you'd like to um you know the shy
 
05:14:52.948 --> 05:14:52.958 align:start position:0%
bonds is one there's a couple other ones
 
05:14:54.910 --> 05:14:54.920 align:start position:0%
that they give as resources because
 
05:14:56.110 --> 05:14:56.120 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to have something
 
05:14:58.190 --> 05:14:58.200 align:start position:0%
in place for when you close that
 
05:15:01.230 --> 05:15:01.240 align:start position:0%
landfill just for cleanup for monitoring
 
05:15:04.590 --> 05:15:04.600 align:start position:0%
all of that that so this isn't something
 
05:15:07.590 --> 05:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
that would take an an we wouldn't have
 
05:15:10.830 --> 05:15:10.840 align:start position:0%
to have designated people they they kind
 
05:15:13.708 --> 05:15:13.718 align:start position:0%
of give a worst case scenario here there
 
05:15:17.270 --> 05:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
is very simple you know um there's very
 
05:15:20.070 --> 05:15:20.080 align:start position:0%
simple criteria that could be looked at
 
05:15:23.230 --> 05:15:23.240 align:start position:0%
and the work isn't done by Dees it's
 
05:15:26.670 --> 05:15:26.680 align:start position:0%
done by the whoever you're trying to per
 
05:15:31.190 --> 05:15:31.200 align:start position:0%
give the permanent to so um I have I
 
05:15:32.590 --> 05:15:32.600 align:start position:0%
could talk talk about this for a long
 
05:15:34.350 --> 05:15:34.360 align:start position:0%
time and I I don't know how long your
 
05:15:35.628 --> 05:15:35.638 align:start position:0%
committee's been going but I've been
 
05:15:39.070 --> 05:15:39.080 align:start position:0%
going all day I wanted to read I wanted
 
05:15:41.830 --> 05:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
to read one thing that is um so this
 
05:15:44.390 --> 05:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
affects um straford County this is
 
05:15:45.430 --> 05:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
affects a
 
05:15:48.270 --> 05:15:48.280 align:start position:0%
constituent uh well several constituents
 
05:15:52.750 --> 05:15:52.760 align:start position:0%
and um a state representative and it's
 
05:15:55.070 --> 05:15:55.080 align:start position:0%
it's really sad so if nobody's heard
 
05:15:56.990 --> 05:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
about the when they demolished the
 
05:15:58.708 --> 05:15:58.718 align:start position:0%
Davidson it used to be called Davidson
 
05:16:01.708 --> 05:16:01.718 align:start position:0%
Rubber Factory that was four decades
 
05:16:04.990 --> 05:16:05.000 align:start position:0%
basically of manufacturing so one worker
 
05:16:06.350 --> 05:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
this was like where they were just kind
 
05:16:08.510 --> 05:16:08.520 align:start position:0%
of thinking back her name was Louise
 
05:16:11.390 --> 05:16:11.400 align:start position:0%
Korn she was hired in October of
 
05:16:15.190 --> 05:16:15.200 align:start position:0%
1966 she spent 36 years with the company
 
05:16:17.510 --> 05:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
as it prospered it did extremely well
 
05:16:19.030 --> 05:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
they moved up in the rankings they were
 
05:16:21.590 --> 05:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
doing rubber manufacturing um all over
 
05:16:21.600 --> 05:16:22.310 align:start position:0%
doing rubber manufacturing um all over
the

05:16:22.310 --> 05:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:16:24.430 --> 05:16:24.440 align:start position:0%
country so she went through several
 
05:16:26.190 --> 05:16:26.200 align:start position:0%
different Transformations it also went
 
05:16:27.948 --> 05:16:27.958 align:start position:0%
through several different hands and
 
05:16:30.230 --> 05:16:30.240 align:start position:0%
eventually it of course withered out and
 
05:16:32.270 --> 05:16:32.280 align:start position:0%
became a large part of a the American
 
05:16:35.150 --> 05:16:35.160 align:start position:0%
manufacturing base so um and they were
 
05:16:36.470 --> 05:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
kind of sold out because of Cheaper
 
05:16:39.910 --> 05:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
labor rates as we all know this is her
 
05:16:42.510 --> 05:16:42.520 align:start position:0%
quote they used to pour the chemicals in
 
05:16:44.548 --> 05:16:44.558 align:start position:0%
the brook out back they didn't know any
 
05:16:47.470 --> 05:16:47.480 align:start position:0%
better back then said Korn this was the
 
05:16:50.510 --> 05:16:50.520 align:start position:0%
stream that ran through the plant under
 
05:16:54.470 --> 05:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
Route 11 and the federal aquifer into
 
05:16:56.910 --> 05:16:56.920 align:start position:0%
which was into which was sunk the town
 
05:16:59.350 --> 05:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
well that was subsequently knocked out
 
05:17:02.270 --> 05:17:02.280 align:start position:0%
of commission they used to quote they
 
05:17:04.230 --> 05:17:04.240 align:start position:0%
used to bury everything from soups to
 
05:17:06.628 --> 05:17:06.638 align:start position:0%
nuts out back I don't know how they'll
 
05:17:11.350 --> 05:17:11.360 align:start position:0%
sell that land said K so right now
 
05:17:13.390 --> 05:17:13.400 align:start position:0%
there's there's been and I can give you
 
05:17:15.788 --> 05:17:15.798 align:start position:0%
kind of an update on that but it's 123
 
05:17:18.830 --> 05:17:18.840 align:start position:0%
acre uh kind of like uh partially
 
05:17:21.628 --> 05:17:21.638 align:start position:0%
partially developed parcel in Farmington
 
05:17:24.868 --> 05:17:24.878 align:start position:0%
but as we know it it doesn't matter if
 
05:17:29.310 --> 05:17:29.320 align:start position:0%
somebody pollutes you know 5T when you
 
05:17:31.750 --> 05:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
get into the water table that's it it's
 
05:17:33.830 --> 05:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
game over and it's the same thing that
 
05:17:35.948 --> 05:17:35.958 align:start position:0%
has to do with like a St gobain you know
 
05:17:37.628 --> 05:17:37.638 align:start position:0%
it wasn't confined to just marac where
 
05:17:40.150 --> 05:17:40.160 align:start position:0%
their plant was located it is now in
 
05:17:42.548 --> 05:17:42.558 align:start position:0%
what seven different seven different
 
05:17:46.030 --> 05:17:46.040 align:start position:0%
cities towns in New Hampshire
 
05:17:49.670 --> 05:17:49.680 align:start position:0%
so this um they're still they're still
 
05:17:51.590 --> 05:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
fighting this there's people's
 
05:17:53.270 --> 05:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
properties that are right there that are
 
05:17:54.868 --> 05:17:54.878 align:start position:0%
that are worth nothing now no one would
 
05:17:58.070 --> 05:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
ever buy that property uh there's a a
 
05:18:01.070 --> 05:18:01.080 align:start position:0%
person their family is a family of four
 
05:18:04.030 --> 05:18:04.040 align:start position:0%
um they now have they all have um
 
05:18:06.708 --> 05:18:06.718 align:start position:0%
they've all had found cancer this this
 
05:18:10.030 --> 05:18:10.040 align:start position:0%
is the voc's which are in the top 10 of
 
05:18:11.670 --> 05:18:11.680 align:start position:0%
the most deadliest compounds that you
 
05:18:16.430 --> 05:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
can find on a site so um I'd love to you
 
05:18:18.910 --> 05:18:18.920 align:start position:0%
know put all of this in writing and kind
 
05:18:21.030 --> 05:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
of dispel some of the myths that are in
 
05:18:23.270 --> 05:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
here I don't believe this fiscal note is
 
05:18:26.390 --> 05:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
even necessary um you know I'm
 
05:18:28.830 --> 05:18:28.840 align:start position:0%
conservative I don't want us to have to
 
05:18:30.868 --> 05:18:30.878 align:start position:0%
spend more money I think that that we
 
05:18:33.310 --> 05:18:33.320 align:start position:0%
have the resources in place uh that we
 
05:18:35.430 --> 05:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
can do this and um and I think it's
 
05:18:38.670 --> 05:18:38.680 align:start position:0%
great for um this is a nonpartisan thing
 
05:18:40.270 --> 05:18:40.280 align:start position:0%
we should have people that are coming
 
05:18:43.590 --> 05:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
here that are working with um with
 
05:18:46.910 --> 05:18:46.920 align:start position:0%
poisonous substances make sure that um
 
05:18:48.590 --> 05:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
that it holds them accountable if
 
05:18:51.150 --> 05:18:51.160 align:start position:0%
something does happen and it's more than
 
05:18:54.110 --> 05:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
just being able to have that Safeguard I
 
05:18:54.120 --> 05:18:55.310 align:start position:0%
just being able to have that Safeguard I
think

05:18:55.310 --> 05:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
think
 
05:18:57.708 --> 05:18:57.718 align:start position:0%
that when when you have someone that has
 
05:19:01.708 --> 05:19:01.718 align:start position:0%
a shity bond it also is kind of a they
 
05:19:03.708 --> 05:19:03.718 align:start position:0%
know that they're going to comply like
 
05:19:06.868 --> 05:19:06.878 align:start position:0%
they have they already have you're
 
05:19:09.910 --> 05:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
you're you're kind of mitigating risks
 
05:19:11.350 --> 05:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
they're signing on something where
 
05:19:12.910 --> 05:19:12.920 align:start position:0%
they're saying okay we're going to be
 
05:19:14.868 --> 05:19:14.878 align:start position:0%
legally compliant you know that they're
 
05:19:16.270 --> 05:19:16.280 align:start position:0%
coming in here and they're not going to
 
05:19:17.868 --> 05:19:17.878 align:start position:0%
have to worry about having a shell
 
05:19:19.310 --> 05:19:19.320 align:start position:0%
company or starting up about a new name
 
05:19:22.070 --> 05:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
in bankrupt and cut and run when
 
05:19:26.030 --> 05:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
something is um is that is that dire
 
05:19:28.670 --> 05:19:28.680 align:start position:0%
so um any
 
05:19:31.430 --> 05:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
questions do anyone yes represent have
 
05:19:33.628 --> 05:19:33.638 align:start position:0%
been wrong thank you very much Mr chair
 
05:19:34.910 --> 05:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
and thank
 
05:19:37.548 --> 05:19:37.558 align:start position:0%
you and thank you representative Penza
 
05:19:40.310 --> 05:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
for bringing this forward um
 
05:19:41.830 --> 05:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
representative healing and I are from
 
05:19:45.030 --> 05:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
miramac so we know um you know what the
 
05:19:47.628 --> 05:19:47.638 align:start position:0%
cost we've had to do in our town to deal
 
05:19:51.990 --> 05:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
with the Senco Bain issue um and boy it
 
05:19:53.910 --> 05:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
would have been great to have them
 
05:19:57.868 --> 05:19:57.878 align:start position:0%
upfront have the the the resources and
 
05:20:00.708 --> 05:20:00.718 align:start position:0%
and take responsibility for that so I
 
05:20:02.510 --> 05:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
think this is definitely on the right
 
05:20:05.510 --> 05:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
track but but I do have some questions
 
05:20:09.150 --> 05:20:09.160 align:start position:0%
um one is um there there are many
 
05:20:11.708 --> 05:20:11.718 align:start position:0%
hazards many many contaminations that
 
05:20:13.910 --> 05:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
happen throughout the country a year
 
05:20:16.070 --> 05:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
with let's say fuel trucks or tanker
 
05:20:18.390 --> 05:20:18.400 align:start position:0%
trucks that derail or there's an
 
05:20:19.990 --> 05:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
accident I mean there was a huge issue
 
05:20:24.270 --> 05:20:24.280 align:start position:0%
in Palestine Ohio um I'm not I don't
 
05:20:26.110 --> 05:20:26.120 align:start position:0%
know if that's really well defined in
 
05:20:28.830 --> 05:20:28.840 align:start position:0%
here Transportation
 
05:20:31.190 --> 05:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
incidences it's and that's one of the
 
05:20:34.390 --> 05:20:34.400 align:start position:0%
biggest sources um and then like if
 
05:20:35.548 --> 05:20:35.558 align:start position:0%
there are
 
05:20:39.590 --> 05:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
contractors uh where a company might and
 
05:20:43.070 --> 05:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
this happens where there may be a a toll
 
05:20:45.030 --> 05:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
manufacturer so let's say there may be a
 
05:20:46.390 --> 05:20:46.400 align:start position:0%
company that
 
05:20:48.910 --> 05:20:48.920 align:start position:0%
produces uh some type of a chemical
 
05:20:53.230 --> 05:20:53.240 align:start position:0%
product but they may contract out uh
 
05:20:56.590 --> 05:20:56.600 align:start position:0%
let's say uh in process step so maybe
 
05:20:58.830 --> 05:20:58.840 align:start position:0%
they they may purchase the raw materials
 
05:21:01.350 --> 05:21:01.360 align:start position:0%
but have another company do produ ction
 
05:21:03.830 --> 05:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
and synthesis of this intermediate and
 
05:21:05.868 --> 05:21:05.878 align:start position:0%
they might finish it off and and I'm not
 
05:21:10.548 --> 05:21:10.558 align:start position:0%
sure that's that's included um and then
 
05:21:12.990 --> 05:21:13.000 align:start position:0%
what if a company during the course of
 
05:21:16.270 --> 05:21:16.280 align:start position:0%
their operations decides to change
 
05:21:19.350 --> 05:21:19.360 align:start position:0%
switch out of material or assume
 
05:21:22.390 --> 05:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
production of a new product um if we're
 
05:21:24.750 --> 05:21:24.760 align:start position:0%
only expecting the shity bond at the
 
05:21:27.310 --> 05:21:27.320 align:start position:0%
time of Licensing I'm not sure we might
 
05:21:30.510 --> 05:21:30.520 align:start position:0%
capture that um and then one example
 
05:21:34.510 --> 05:21:34.520 align:start position:0%
yesterday I was testifying at I provided
 
05:21:37.230 --> 05:21:37.240 align:start position:0%
testimony at a Senate bill regarding the
 
05:21:39.310 --> 05:21:39.320 align:start position:0%
salting of Continental Boulevard in
 
05:21:44.190 --> 05:21:44.200 align:start position:0%
miramac and the salting by the state has
 
05:21:46.110 --> 05:21:46.120 align:start position:0%
contaminated one of our wells to the
 
05:21:47.548 --> 05:21:47.558 align:start position:0%
point that we had to shut it down and
 
05:21:51.430 --> 05:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
build a new one um so you know would the
 
05:21:54.910 --> 05:21:54.920 align:start position:0%
state something like that be captured so
 
05:21:56.830 --> 05:21:56.840 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering if you would
 
05:21:59.990 --> 05:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
entertain maybe uh an amendment that
 
05:22:02.548 --> 05:22:02.558 align:start position:0%
maybe instead of of this bill maybe
 
05:22:04.430 --> 05:22:04.440 align:start position:0%
might put together a study committee to
 
05:22:07.350 --> 05:22:07.360 align:start position:0%
look at all these different factors um
 
05:22:10.350 --> 05:22:10.360 align:start position:0%
to make sure that whatever is is really
 
05:22:12.670 --> 05:22:12.680 align:start position:0%
very comprehensive and covers all the
 
05:22:16.430 --> 05:22:16.440 align:start position:0%
you know dots the eyes and crosses the
 
05:22:19.230 --> 05:22:19.240 align:start position:0%
te's I think it's hard to be to have a
 
05:22:22.270 --> 05:22:22.280 align:start position:0%
one c one size fits all because that's
 
05:22:25.110 --> 05:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
if we can this is this is going to take
 
05:22:27.470 --> 05:22:27.480 align:start position:0%
care of a huge issue a huge gap that
 
05:22:30.430 --> 05:22:30.440 align:start position:0%
we're not requiring where almost every
 
05:22:33.470 --> 05:22:33.480 align:start position:0%
other state in some capacity is I
 
05:22:34.990 --> 05:22:35.000 align:start position:0%
understand right if a transportation if
 
05:22:37.590 --> 05:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
a big Transportation um company is
 
05:22:40.030 --> 05:22:40.040 align:start position:0%
coming in through a truck and there's a
 
05:22:40.040 --> 05:22:41.628 align:start position:0%
coming in through a truck and there's a
spill

05:22:41.628 --> 05:22:41.638 align:start position:0%
spill
 
05:22:44.270 --> 05:22:44.280 align:start position:0%
99% of the time that is covered because
 
05:22:46.990 --> 05:22:47.000 align:start position:0%
they're under a huge National umbrella
 
05:22:48.670 --> 05:22:48.680 align:start position:0%
so we're covered by a lot of those
 
05:22:51.230 --> 05:22:51.240 align:start position:0%
things automatically now of course if
 
05:22:52.830 --> 05:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
it's something that happens with the
 
05:22:56.948 --> 05:22:56.958 align:start position:0%
state um but you know we're on the hook
 
05:22:58.948 --> 05:22:58.958 align:start position:0%
for that and there there's not really
 
05:23:00.750 --> 05:23:00.760 align:start position:0%
there's not really much that we can do
 
05:23:04.110 --> 05:23:04.120 align:start position:0%
um um I do want to speak to fuel stuff
 
05:23:07.030 --> 05:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
so New Hampshire had and I'm trying to
 
05:23:10.430 --> 05:23:10.440 align:start position:0%
think of when this was was it 200 12 uh
 
05:23:14.470 --> 05:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
I'll send you that too about mtbe so we
 
05:23:17.470 --> 05:23:17.480 align:start position:0%
had the largest uh we had literally we
 
05:23:19.670 --> 05:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
got the largest settlement from that and
 
05:23:21.270 --> 05:23:21.280 align:start position:0%
so if you look in the folks that are out
 
05:23:24.030 --> 05:23:24.040 align:start position:0%
in East Swansea so it's very very small
 
05:23:26.990 --> 05:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
town and they have been begging for
 
05:23:28.910 --> 05:23:28.920 align:start position:0%
years and it's kind of kind of Fallen
 
05:23:30.350 --> 05:23:30.360 align:start position:0%
deaf ears and they haven't done much
 
05:23:32.590 --> 05:23:32.600 align:start position:0%
about it about a cancer cluster because
 
05:23:36.390 --> 05:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
of the mtbe poisoning from under
 
05:23:38.910 --> 05:23:38.920 align:start position:0%
underground tanks uh in regards with
 
05:23:40.868 --> 05:23:40.878 align:start position:0%
petroleum they haven't gotten a dime of
 
05:23:43.230 --> 05:23:43.240 align:start position:0%
that money we got
 
05:23:46.830 --> 05:23:46.840 align:start position:0%
$263 million and there
 
05:23:49.708 --> 05:23:49.718 align:start position:0%
is I've seen the whole their their they
 
05:23:53.070 --> 05:23:53.080 align:start position:0%
have a chart of all of these homes and
 
05:23:56.070 --> 05:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
becau and there's cancer throughout the
 
05:23:59.070 --> 05:23:59.080 align:start position:0%
entire family to include you know
 
05:24:01.390 --> 05:24:01.400 align:start position:0%
children and it's
 
05:24:03.628 --> 05:24:03.638 align:start position:0%
where is that money gone what are they
 
05:24:05.590 --> 05:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
using what is our state using for those
 
05:24:08.548 --> 05:24:08.558 align:start position:0%
things and it's um that's the kind of
 
05:24:09.990 --> 05:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
stuff that doesn't make sense we've
 
05:24:12.070 --> 05:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
gotten some big settlements and if we're
 
05:24:14.390 --> 05:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
not using that to help folks that are
 
05:24:16.910 --> 05:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
that have been infected by like mtbe all
 
05:24:18.548 --> 05:24:18.558 align:start position:0%
of that ground poisoning then we should
 
05:24:21.030 --> 05:24:21.040 align:start position:0%
be using that in other places like that
 
05:24:23.310 --> 05:24:23.320 align:start position:0%
money should be used in in with what's
 
05:24:25.390 --> 05:24:25.400 align:start position:0%
going on with St Cain that money is a
 
05:24:27.628 --> 05:24:27.638 align:start position:0%
huge settlement and should be dispersed
 
05:24:28.868 --> 05:24:28.878 align:start position:0%
out and that can happen through the
 
05:24:31.390 --> 05:24:31.400 align:start position:0%
executive branch and our and our Council
 
05:24:34.070 --> 05:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
so I believe that this is the first step
 
05:24:35.750 --> 05:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
if I've missed something that we could
 
05:24:38.190 --> 05:24:38.200 align:start position:0%
catch here great I also don't want it to
 
05:24:40.270 --> 05:24:40.280 align:start position:0%
be too restrictive that this doesn't go
 
05:24:42.750 --> 05:24:42.760 align:start position:0%
through either I want to make sure that
 
05:24:45.390 --> 05:24:45.400 align:start position:0%
it is not um it's it's not going to
 
05:24:47.830 --> 05:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
restrict Dees from being able to do what
 
05:24:50.590 --> 05:24:50.600 align:start position:0%
they need to do but it also it can be
 
05:24:53.990 --> 05:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
there's there are specific um there are
 
05:24:56.390 --> 05:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
specific Industries and companies and
 
05:24:59.470 --> 05:24:59.480 align:start position:0%
manufacturers that we know produce toxic
 
05:25:02.470 --> 05:25:02.480 align:start position:0%
waste and that kind of thing so we can
 
05:25:05.510 --> 05:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
we can hit those up and and then as
 
05:25:07.670 --> 05:25:07.680 align:start position:0%
moving forward we've had nothing go on
 
05:25:11.310 --> 05:25:11.320 align:start position:0%
for decades and it's it's time
 
05:25:14.230 --> 05:25:14.240 align:start position:0%
so follow up yeah I just want to point
 
05:25:17.708 --> 05:25:17.718 align:start position:0%
out that the mtbe settlement money uh to
 
05:25:20.430 --> 05:25:20.440 align:start position:0%
my knowledge funded the drinking water
 
05:25:23.510 --> 05:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
and groundwater trust fund and marac did
 
05:25:26.470 --> 05:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
tap into that to help uh defray the
 
05:25:29.708 --> 05:25:29.718 align:start position:0%
expenses of uh building our past
 
05:25:31.708 --> 05:25:31.718 align:start position:0%
treatment plants so just to let you know
 
05:25:34.548 --> 05:25:34.558 align:start position:0%
that that fund exists any other
 
05:25:42.430 --> 05:25:42.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:45.590 --> 05:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
lonte I really appreciate your
 
05:25:45.600 --> 05:25:48.990 align:start position:0%
lonte I really appreciate your
motivation

05:25:48.990 --> 05:25:49.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:51.868 --> 05:25:51.878 align:start position:0%
and I really appreciate your the
 
05:25:54.590 --> 05:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
motivation behind this Bell and I agree
 
05:25:57.990 --> 05:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
it's very important it just does seem
 
05:26:01.310 --> 05:26:01.320 align:start position:0%
so broad um
 
05:26:03.548 --> 05:26:03.558 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering like the line where
 
05:26:05.990 --> 05:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
you require persons working in that in
 
05:26:06.000 --> 05:26:06.990 align:start position:0%
you require persons working in that in
such

05:26:06.990 --> 05:26:07.000 align:start position:0%
such
 
05:26:09.590 --> 05:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
Industries um would that apply to every
 
05:26:13.390 --> 05:26:13.400 align:start position:0%
employee of the company or uh the owner
 
05:26:16.350 --> 05:26:16.360 align:start position:0%
of the company or the board of directors
 
05:26:18.110 --> 05:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
um that's one of the little changes
 
05:26:20.548 --> 05:26:20.558 align:start position:0%
we're going to make in Amendment the
 
05:26:25.708 --> 05:26:25.718 align:start position:0%
other you know the task of looking at
 
05:26:30.190 --> 05:26:30.200 align:start position:0%
the many ways that any industry or
 
05:26:34.270 --> 05:26:34.280 align:start position:0%
enterpr Riser or process could affect
 
05:26:36.150 --> 05:26:36.160 align:start position:0%
the air water and soil that that is an
 
05:26:38.310 --> 05:26:38.320 align:start position:0%
enormous task to try to put a dollar
 
05:26:41.430 --> 05:26:41.440 align:start position:0%
value on that and think it all the way
 
05:26:44.470 --> 05:26:44.480 align:start position:0%
through um that would require some money
 
05:26:46.350 --> 05:26:46.360 align:start position:0%
and you said well the people applying
 
05:26:50.910 --> 05:26:50.920 align:start position:0%
for the the um the license would be the
 
05:26:52.750 --> 05:26:52.760 align:start position:0%
ones to do that well well they would
 
05:26:56.270 --> 05:26:56.280 align:start position:0%
have an incentive to downplay what those
 
05:26:57.708 --> 05:26:57.718 align:start position:0%
costs would
 
05:27:02.310 --> 05:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
be so there just seems to be
 
05:27:05.910 --> 05:27:05.920 align:start position:0%
um many aspects of this that aren't
 
05:27:08.430 --> 05:27:08.440 align:start position:0%
quite thought out yet and that's I kind
 
05:27:11.670 --> 05:27:11.680 align:start position:0%
of agree with representative Run's idea
 
05:27:17.910 --> 05:27:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:20.548 --> 05:27:20.558 align:start position:0%
further so this was I guess this was a
 
05:27:22.350 --> 05:27:22.360 align:start position:0%
bill that was put in before I'm a new
 
05:27:26.270 --> 05:27:26.280 align:start position:0%
representative and uh it was I don't I
 
05:27:27.548 --> 05:27:27.558 align:start position:0%
don't think it was studied and then it
 
05:27:29.830 --> 05:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
was ited so this has gone around a
 
05:27:34.190 --> 05:27:34.200 align:start position:0%
little bit I'm gonna speak to Yes um one
 
05:27:36.230 --> 05:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
persons needs clarification to mean the
 
05:27:37.910 --> 05:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
owner operator of the business rather
 
05:27:40.708 --> 05:27:40.718 align:start position:0%
than any individual that will be changed
 
05:27:43.948 --> 05:27:43.958 align:start position:0%
um you know the blackl language um of
 
05:27:46.470 --> 05:27:46.480 align:start position:0%
the bill is you know fairly clear though
 
05:27:47.788 --> 05:27:47.798 align:start position:0%
that legal actions would be against
 
05:27:50.390 --> 05:27:50.400 align:start position:0%
polluting businesses of course not Dees
 
05:27:51.390 --> 05:27:51.400 align:start position:0%
because that was one thing in their
 
05:27:56.110 --> 05:27:56.120 align:start position:0%
letter as well um the other uh there was
 
05:27:57.310 --> 05:27:57.320 align:start position:0%
one thing
 
05:27:59.430 --> 05:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
here let me
 
05:27:59.440 --> 05:28:03.270 align:start position:0%
here let me
see

05:28:03.270 --> 05:28:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:03.280 --> 05:28:04.070 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:28:04.070 --> 05:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:28:09.270 --> 05:28:09.280 align:start position:0%
so um at once needs to be specif against
 
05:28:12.990 --> 05:28:13.000 align:start position:0%
gener okay so of course this isn't just
 
05:28:14.708 --> 05:28:14.718 align:start position:0%
because I'm I'm mean Anda and the
 
05:28:16.670 --> 05:28:16.680 align:start position:0%
landfills are you know that's you know
 
05:28:18.150 --> 05:28:18.160 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the Hot Topic or whatever
 
05:28:19.708 --> 05:28:19.718 align:start position:0%
but this generally really needs to
 
05:28:21.510 --> 05:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
reflect the need for shy bonding for
 
05:28:24.350 --> 05:28:24.360 align:start position:0%
other types of highrisk polluting land
 
05:28:27.310 --> 05:28:27.320 align:start position:0%
uses and in that regard that's where
 
05:28:29.548 --> 05:28:29.558 align:start position:0%
most of the research that I've done is
 
05:28:32.030 --> 05:28:32.040 align:start position:0%
so when you are putting together a
 
05:28:36.030 --> 05:28:36.040 align:start position:0%
proposal to build a $50 million $100
 
05:28:39.310 --> 05:28:39.320 align:start position:0%
million facility all of that stuff is
 
05:28:42.070 --> 05:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
already there this this is industry
 
05:28:45.070 --> 05:28:45.080 align:start position:0%
standard information so for you to be
 
05:28:48.310 --> 05:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
worried that they could undercut that it
 
05:28:50.270 --> 05:28:50.280 align:start position:0%
just doesn't happen it we're talking
 
05:28:52.830 --> 05:28:52.840 align:start position:0%
about stuff that is already a known it's
 
05:28:56.430 --> 05:28:56.440 align:start position:0%
a known entity we know what we know
 
05:28:59.270 --> 05:28:59.280 align:start position:0%
there's already formulas for cleanups
 
05:29:01.788 --> 05:29:01.798 align:start position:0%
for landfills for cleanups for old
 
05:29:04.110 --> 05:29:04.120 align:start position:0%
school buildings all of that stuff has
 
05:29:06.510 --> 05:29:06.520 align:start position:0%
been in place for a very very long time
 
05:29:09.830 --> 05:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
the EPA has tons of documents on this
 
05:29:12.310 --> 05:29:12.320 align:start position:0%
they so I'm just saying that all of that
 
05:29:15.350 --> 05:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
work has been done for a long time for
 
05:29:18.030 --> 05:29:18.040 align:start position:0%
plastic producers uh uh rubber
 
05:29:20.868 --> 05:29:20.878 align:start position:0%
manufacturers ones that are emitting any
 
05:29:22.990 --> 05:29:23.000 align:start position:0%
of course you know the forever chemicals
 
05:29:25.070 --> 05:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
which are newer um but those are really
 
05:29:27.948 --> 05:29:27.958 align:start position:0%
on the radar at this point but all of
 
05:29:32.750 --> 05:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
the dioxane uh one through for uh voc's
 
05:29:34.788 --> 05:29:34.798 align:start position:0%
all of that kind of stuff is is really a
 
05:29:37.868 --> 05:29:37.878 align:start position:0%
known entity in that manufacturing so
 
05:29:39.910 --> 05:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
this isn't something that they would
 
05:29:41.990 --> 05:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
have to do Dees wouldn't have to do that
 
05:29:44.110 --> 05:29:44.120 align:start position:0%
work and this is already information
 
05:29:47.670 --> 05:29:47.680 align:start position:0%
that is really on a known entity so just
 
05:29:48.788 --> 05:29:48.798 align:start position:0%
to speak to
 
05:29:51.510 --> 05:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
05:29:53.788 --> 05:29:53.798 align:start position:0%
Bale thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
05:29:55.150 --> 05:29:55.160 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
05:29:59.470 --> 05:29:59.480 align:start position:0%
representative um so recently we have
 
05:30:02.270 --> 05:30:02.280 align:start position:0%
come up against an asphalt plant being
 
05:30:04.548 --> 05:30:04.558 align:start position:0%
built in the middle of Nashville
 
05:30:06.230 --> 05:30:06.240 align:start position:0%
something that really concerns us it's
 
05:30:10.390 --> 05:30:10.400 align:start position:0%
right in the middle of four schools and
 
05:30:12.830 --> 05:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
the most congested part of our city it's
 
05:30:15.030 --> 05:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
also in the worst Economic Opportunity
 
05:30:17.628 --> 05:30:17.638 align:start position:0%
in End Zone and that's probably not by
 
05:30:20.670 --> 05:30:20.680 align:start position:0%
mistake so we had public hearings and I
 
05:30:24.070 --> 05:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
went in and I asked for that company to
 
05:30:28.548 --> 05:30:28.558 align:start position:0%
bond a cleanup but as I was coming back
 
05:30:30.868 --> 05:30:30.878 align:start position:0%
to my seat I'm like well who measures
 
05:30:33.110 --> 05:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
how much that would be and how do we
 
05:30:35.110 --> 05:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
come to that kind of determination who
 
05:30:39.430 --> 05:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
would be involved besides me in a city
 
05:30:42.910 --> 05:30:42.920 align:start position:0%
public hearing so I just um have some
 
05:30:45.190 --> 05:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
questions about
 
05:30:48.470 --> 05:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
that so just because we're working on
 
05:30:50.868 --> 05:30:50.878 align:start position:0%
all the new rules for like permitting
 
05:30:52.470 --> 05:30:52.480 align:start position:0%
landfills I'm just going to give you
 
05:30:55.270 --> 05:30:55.280 align:start position:0%
that example so and that's just one at
 
05:30:57.270 --> 05:30:57.280 align:start position:0%
the Solid Waste Department you know in
 
05:30:59.868 --> 05:30:59.878 align:start position:0%
Dees is just one of many different all
 
05:31:04.030 --> 05:31:04.040 align:start position:0%
these areas so them along with the EPA
 
05:31:06.628 --> 05:31:06.638 align:start position:0%
have those expertise so the asphalt
 
05:31:08.830 --> 05:31:08.840 align:start position:0%
company that is coming in for example
 
05:31:11.030 --> 05:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
they do it based upon size a based upon
 
05:31:13.750 --> 05:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
scope employees production all of that
 
05:31:16.548 --> 05:31:16.558 align:start position:0%
stuff when when because no matter what
 
05:31:19.430 --> 05:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
they are going to have to get a permit
 
05:31:22.590 --> 05:31:22.600 align:start position:0%
from Dees it's going to have to happen
 
05:31:24.788 --> 05:31:24.798 align:start position:0%
so it's none of those none of those
 
05:31:26.070 --> 05:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
folks are going to be able to just come
 
05:31:28.990 --> 05:31:29.000 align:start position:0%
in purchase a piece of property when uh
 
05:31:30.910 --> 05:31:30.920 align:start position:0%
it can have it an environmental impact
 
05:31:32.590 --> 05:31:32.600 align:start position:0%
and just start building that's what I'm
 
05:31:35.070 --> 05:31:35.080 align:start position:0%
saying all of that stuff is all those
 
05:31:36.868 --> 05:31:36.878 align:start position:0%
formulas that are in place they know
 
05:31:38.510 --> 05:31:38.520 align:start position:0%
that because they're building it they
 
05:31:40.310 --> 05:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
know what kind of they know what kind of
 
05:31:42.070 --> 05:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
waste is going to be outputed all of
 
05:31:45.310 --> 05:31:45.320 align:start position:0%
that kind of stuff so it's really you
 
05:31:48.430 --> 05:31:48.440 align:start position:0%
know the agency that is controlling that
 
05:31:49.990 --> 05:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
the city of course is going to be able
 
05:31:54.750 --> 05:31:54.760 align:start position:0%
to through you know uh public input um
 
05:31:56.750 --> 05:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
through petitions if if you guys don't
 
05:31:58.350 --> 05:31:58.360 align:start position:0%
want it you're going to have to Rally
 
05:32:00.548 --> 05:32:00.558 align:start position:0%
your troops to to to make sure that it's
 
05:32:03.230 --> 05:32:03.240 align:start position:0%
not there and get your city council to
 
05:32:06.310 --> 05:32:06.320 align:start position:0%
to you know to uh reject that that can
 
05:32:08.390 --> 05:32:08.400 align:start position:0%
happen on that level but if it does get
 
05:32:11.070 --> 05:32:11.080 align:start position:0%
approved and it comes all that whole
 
05:32:13.510 --> 05:32:13.520 align:start position:0%
process um just like it is for the
 
05:32:16.830 --> 05:32:16.840 align:start position:0%
permanent process for a landfill um same
 
05:32:18.948 --> 05:32:18.958 align:start position:0%
thing for a permanent process for a
 
05:32:21.788 --> 05:32:21.798 align:start position:0%
Plastics Company all of the work that St
 
05:32:23.788 --> 05:32:23.798 align:start position:0%
Cain did
 
05:32:27.470 --> 05:32:27.480 align:start position:0%
um was uh you know was I don't want I
 
05:32:29.590 --> 05:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
just say rubber stamp and approved but
 
05:32:30.628 --> 05:32:30.638 align:start position:0%
there was
 
05:32:34.788 --> 05:32:34.798 align:start position:0%
already uh um it made it easier for Dees
 
05:32:36.030 --> 05:32:36.040 align:start position:0%
and that should have been looked at
 
05:32:38.070 --> 05:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
because they were purchasing something
 
05:32:41.310 --> 05:32:41.320 align:start position:0%
else that was already there um and maybe
 
05:32:42.670 --> 05:32:42.680 align:start position:0%
that's something that could be in there
 
05:32:45.548 --> 05:32:45.558 align:start position:0%
too like if it's a a current a sitting
 
05:32:48.470 --> 05:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
structure a business that has been um
 
05:32:50.708 --> 05:32:50.718 align:start position:0%
shut down because they're selling or
 
05:32:53.548 --> 05:32:53.558 align:start position:0%
getting out then um then it needs to go
 
05:32:55.390 --> 05:32:55.400 align:start position:0%
through the same process if someone's
 
05:32:57.150 --> 05:32:57.160 align:start position:0%
purchasing that property and putting
 
05:32:58.628 --> 05:32:58.638 align:start position:0%
another business in there if it's the
 
05:33:00.750 --> 05:33:00.760 align:start position:0%
same type so
 
05:33:04.270 --> 05:33:04.280 align:start position:0%
I I think that I want this to go through
 
05:33:07.788 --> 05:33:07.798 align:start position:0%
so I want impact uh like I said I am not
 
05:33:10.948 --> 05:33:10.958 align:start position:0%
an expert I'm going to um um but I'm a
 
05:33:13.430 --> 05:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
dog on a bone for research so whatever
 
05:33:16.150 --> 05:33:16.160 align:start position:0%
you guys are going to give me I will um
 
05:33:18.830 --> 05:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
I will work on this and I I think it's
 
05:33:22.030 --> 05:33:22.040 align:start position:0%
just we need this level of protection
 
05:33:24.750 --> 05:33:24.760 align:start position:0%
and to be honest if if you want to come
 
05:33:27.270 --> 05:33:27.280 align:start position:0%
into the state and and and produce
 
05:33:29.110 --> 05:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
whatever you're producing and even
 
05:33:31.590 --> 05:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
though it has you know it has some some
 
05:33:33.948 --> 05:33:33.958 align:start position:0%
negative toxic waste that comes with it
 
05:33:35.788 --> 05:33:35.798 align:start position:0%
if you are handling it appropriately in
 
05:33:38.548 --> 05:33:38.558 align:start position:0%
the right way um so you're providing you
 
05:33:40.150 --> 05:33:40.160 align:start position:0%
know whatever Service as well you're
 
05:33:42.470 --> 05:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
providing jobs but you're also doing the
 
05:33:44.190 --> 05:33:44.200 align:start position:0%
right thing for the environment I'm all
 
05:33:45.750 --> 05:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
for that I think we have to have that
 
05:33:47.590 --> 05:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
balance and I want to make sure that
 
05:33:49.390 --> 05:33:49.400 align:start position:0%
this bill covers that because I I want
 
05:33:51.270 --> 05:33:51.280 align:start position:0%
this to go through I think that this is
 
05:33:54.830 --> 05:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
a this is a bipartisan nonpartisan this
 
05:33:56.310 --> 05:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
is great for our New Hampshire citizens
 
05:33:58.470 --> 05:33:58.480 align:start position:0%
and we need this
 
05:34:00.830 --> 05:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
now thank you representative I have a
 
05:34:02.990 --> 05:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
question what if the shity company will
 
05:34:05.548 --> 05:34:05.558 align:start position:0%
not issue a bond in the amount that is
 
05:34:10.910 --> 05:34:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:15.390 --> 05:34:15.400 align:start position:0%
have so I brought that question up when
 
05:34:17.270 --> 05:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
um when the constituent asked me to file
 
05:34:19.830 --> 05:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
this and so I went to look I just
 
05:34:22.708 --> 05:34:22.718 align:start position:0%
started do some research to see how many
 
05:34:25.628 --> 05:34:25.638 align:start position:0%
were like rejected and the only ones
 
05:34:28.270 --> 05:34:28.280 align:start position:0%
that I could find really were ones that
 
05:34:31.510 --> 05:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
had companies that had bad track records
 
05:34:35.350 --> 05:34:35.360 align:start position:0%
so it's just like anything else if um
 
05:34:37.708 --> 05:34:37.718 align:start position:0%
you know insurance if I'm a heavy
 
05:34:39.910 --> 05:34:39.920 align:start position:0%
drinker and and smoker and all of that
 
05:34:43.230 --> 05:34:43.240 align:start position:0%
my life insurance is going to be more so
 
05:34:45.830 --> 05:34:45.840 align:start position:0%
the usually there's not a Flatout denial
 
05:34:49.628 --> 05:34:49.638 align:start position:0%
if someone had had problems in the past
 
05:34:51.990 --> 05:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
and um our company had problems in the
 
05:34:54.670 --> 05:34:54.680 align:start position:0%
past and they wanted to write the ship
 
05:34:56.750 --> 05:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
yes their rates were higher but it was
 
05:34:58.948 --> 05:34:58.958 align:start position:0%
always determined on okay so you have
 
05:35:01.310 --> 05:35:01.320 align:start position:0%
one for in colado I think it was they
 
05:35:03.470 --> 05:35:03.480 align:start position:0%
had to have a 15-year track record they
 
05:35:05.670 --> 05:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
were able to issue the security Bond but
 
05:35:08.390 --> 05:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
they had to have a 15-year track record
 
05:35:09.990 --> 05:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
and um and then once that their rates
 
05:35:12.190 --> 05:35:12.200 align:start position:0%
would go down so there's incentives to
 
05:35:14.708 --> 05:35:14.718 align:start position:0%
be able to do that the O I didn't really
 
05:35:16.990 --> 05:35:17.000 align:start position:0%
see many that were a Flatout denial the
 
05:35:18.868 --> 05:35:18.878 align:start position:0%
only ones that are Flatout denials are
 
05:35:20.150 --> 05:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
companies that we wouldn't want here in
 
05:35:21.190 --> 05:35:21.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
05:35:23.830 --> 05:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
anyway thank you any other questions for
 
05:35:23.840 --> 05:35:25.510 align:start position:0%
anyway thank you any other questions for
the

05:35:25.510 --> 05:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:35:27.590 --> 05:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
representative seeing none thank you for
 
05:35:31.350 --> 05:35:31.360 align:start position:0%
your testimony thanks Ted deers New
 
05:35:31.360 --> 05:35:36.590 align:start position:0%
your testimony thanks Ted deers New
Hampshire

05:35:36.590 --> 05:35:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:53.190 --> 05:35:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:56.868 --> 05:35:56.878 align:start position:0%
no Mr chair members of the committee I
 
05:35:59.070 --> 05:35:59.080 align:start position:0%
am still Ted deers I am the assistant
 
05:36:01.030 --> 05:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
director of the division at the New
 
05:36:03.470 --> 05:36:03.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Environmental
 
05:36:06.750 --> 05:36:06.760 align:start position:0%
Services I have a letter of testimony uh
 
05:36:08.830 --> 05:36:08.840 align:start position:0%
going around you've already seen uh a
 
05:36:12.750 --> 05:36:12.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal note uh that we prepared um I
 
05:36:15.110 --> 05:36:15.120 align:start position:0%
think that there's some places where a
 
05:36:17.628 --> 05:36:17.638 align:start position:0%
representative um Penza and the
 
05:36:19.990 --> 05:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
department would agree wholeheartedly uh
 
05:36:22.070 --> 05:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
on this and that is certainly that uh
 
05:36:24.470 --> 05:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
certainly polluters should pay uh that
 
05:36:26.270 --> 05:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
is I think a basic premise of this and
 
05:36:28.628 --> 05:36:28.638 align:start position:0%
the concept of that is absolutely I
 
05:36:31.590 --> 05:36:31.600 align:start position:0%
think in keeping with with other state
 
05:36:35.548 --> 05:36:35.558 align:start position:0%
policies um and and certainly uh you
 
05:36:37.628 --> 05:36:37.638 align:start position:0%
know to be to be worried about you know
 
05:36:40.470 --> 05:36:40.480 align:start position:0%
sort of future uh issues that might uh
 
05:36:43.430 --> 05:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
come up with a license that gets um you
 
05:36:44.868 --> 05:36:44.878 align:start position:0%
know that gets
 
05:36:48.310 --> 05:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
created that said um we definitely the
 
05:36:50.150 --> 05:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
way that this bill is written right now
 
05:36:52.628 --> 05:36:52.638 align:start position:0%
we would have to oppose and largely
 
05:36:54.990 --> 05:36:55.000 align:start position:0%
because it is extraordinarily General
 
05:36:56.270 --> 05:36:56.280 align:start position:0%
and I think this was brought up in some
 
05:36:59.628 --> 05:36:59.638 align:start position:0%
of the questioning um it was it's
 
05:37:01.190 --> 05:37:01.200 align:start position:0%
sounded like from the testimony that it
 
05:37:04.030 --> 05:37:04.040 align:start position:0%
was is meant to to apply to toxics or or
 
05:37:05.788 --> 05:37:05.798 align:start position:0%
to other things that may be specifically
 
05:37:08.830 --> 05:37:08.840 align:start position:0%
harmful to humans uh that's not outlined
 
05:37:11.548 --> 05:37:11.558 align:start position:0%
in this particular Bill language um and
 
05:37:13.628 --> 05:37:13.638 align:start position:0%
it also is very clear that the
 
05:37:16.190 --> 05:37:16.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner that is the department
 
05:37:18.788 --> 05:37:18.798 align:start position:0%
would play a significant role in
 
05:37:21.628 --> 05:37:21.638 align:start position:0%
determining actual value of potential
 
05:37:24.150 --> 05:37:24.160 align:start position:0%
future damages um and that is something
 
05:37:26.310 --> 05:37:26.320 align:start position:0%
that we don't have a lot of experience
 
05:37:28.910 --> 05:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
doing would require a lot we believe a
 
05:37:30.830 --> 05:37:30.840 align:start position:0%
significant amount amount of staff and
 
05:37:33.868 --> 05:37:33.878 align:start position:0%
expertise in order to be able to do that
 
05:37:36.548 --> 05:37:36.558 align:start position:0%
the bill doesn't um set up an authority
 
05:37:38.628 --> 05:37:38.638 align:start position:0%
to write rules so it appears that it
 
05:37:40.590 --> 05:37:40.600 align:start position:0%
would actually rely on other rules so
 
05:37:43.868 --> 05:37:43.878 align:start position:0%
that's not clear how that would play out
 
05:37:46.590 --> 05:37:46.600 align:start position:0%
um and I would just point out to you all
 
05:37:48.948 --> 05:37:48.958 align:start position:0%
that the Department issues on the order
 
05:37:48.958 --> 05:37:50.190 align:start position:0%
that the Department issues on the order
of

05:37:50.190 --> 05:37:50.200 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:37:53.190 --> 05:37:53.200 align:start position:0%
10,000 different permit or 10,000
 
05:37:55.708 --> 05:37:55.718 align:start position:0%
individual permits and licenses on an
 
05:37:59.070 --> 05:37:59.080 align:start position:0%
annual basis so does this apply to all
 
05:38:01.788 --> 05:38:01.798 align:start position:0%
of those because we wouldn't necessarily
 
05:38:05.150 --> 05:38:05.160 align:start position:0%
be giving you a license uh or a permit
 
05:38:07.548 --> 05:38:07.558 align:start position:0%
if you didn't have um the potential to
 
05:38:10.430 --> 05:38:10.440 align:start position:0%
pollute the air water or soil right so
 
05:38:13.030 --> 05:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
if you look at the overall statutes does
 
05:38:15.310 --> 05:38:15.320 align:start position:0%
this apply to all of those I think that
 
05:38:16.750 --> 05:38:16.760 align:start position:0%
we heard from the testimony it was meant
 
05:38:19.110 --> 05:38:19.120 align:start position:0%
to apply to some subset of those that's
 
05:38:22.350 --> 05:38:22.360 align:start position:0%
not indicated within this particular
 
05:38:24.470 --> 05:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
Bill uh like I said I don't think that
 
05:38:26.390 --> 05:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of experience in this
 
05:38:29.190 --> 05:38:29.200 align:start position:0%
world so I we would need to understand a
 
05:38:31.750 --> 05:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
lot more about it before we were able to
 
05:38:34.270 --> 05:38:34.280 align:start position:0%
I think provide um more technical
 
05:38:37.468 --> 05:38:37.478 align:start position:0%
assistance in crafting a bill uh I tend
 
05:38:39.270 --> 05:38:39.280 align:start position:0%
to think that this idea of studying it a
 
05:38:41.310 --> 05:38:41.320 align:start position:0%
little bit more makes some sense again
 
05:38:44.390 --> 05:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
given the concept itself is is certainly
 
05:38:46.868 --> 05:38:46.878 align:start position:0%
an important one of understanding how do
 
05:38:49.548 --> 05:38:49.558 align:start position:0%
we pay for future problems uh that our
 
05:38:51.468 --> 05:38:51.478 align:start position:0%
children or grandchildren shouldn't have
 
05:38:54.350 --> 05:38:54.360 align:start position:0%
to inherit so I I I certainly think that
 
05:38:57.190 --> 05:38:57.200 align:start position:0%
we're willing to to participate in
 
05:39:00.350 --> 05:39:00.360 align:start position:0%
future discussions as a department um
 
05:39:02.430 --> 05:39:02.440 align:start position:0%
and happy to answer any questions that
 
05:39:05.868 --> 05:39:05.878 align:start position:0%
you might have here today thank you very
 
05:39:09.548 --> 05:39:09.558 align:start position:0%
much thank you any
 
05:39:11.868 --> 05:39:11.878 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
05:39:13.990 --> 05:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
Kelly thank you Mr deers for being here
 
05:39:16.110 --> 05:39:16.120 align:start position:0%
today so I guess my question you might
 
05:39:17.468 --> 05:39:17.478 align:start position:0%
probably don't have the numbers on hand
 
05:39:21.190 --> 05:39:21.200 align:start position:0%
but uh so Berlin where I'm where I'm
 
05:39:22.948 --> 05:39:22.958 align:start position:0%
representing one has one of the most
 
05:39:24.948 --> 05:39:24.958 align:start position:0%
famous super fund sites in the state um
 
05:39:29.070 --> 05:39:29.080 align:start position:0%
dating back to 1999 and the the and I I
 
05:39:30.708 --> 05:39:30.718 align:start position:0%
I didn't know if the department has any
 
05:39:32.670 --> 05:39:32.680 align:start position:0%
figure about how much it cost because
 
05:39:34.430 --> 05:39:34.440 align:start position:0%
the department was responsible for the
 
05:39:35.830 --> 05:39:35.840 align:start position:0%
original excavation of all the Mercury
 
05:39:37.750 --> 05:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
on the site uh back in
 
05:39:40.270 --> 05:39:40.280 align:start position:0%
1999 and and and I'm wondering because
 
05:39:44.230 --> 05:39:44.240 align:start position:0%
the the final uh settlement with Georgia
 
05:39:46.230 --> 05:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
Pacific who eventually took ownership of
 
05:39:48.548 --> 05:39:48.558 align:start position:0%
the assets uh there the final owner of
 
05:39:50.708 --> 05:39:50.718 align:start position:0%
the assets uh settled with the EPA for
 
05:39:50.718 --> 05:39:51.390 align:start position:0%
the assets uh settled with the EPA for
about

05:39:51.390 --> 05:39:51.400 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:39:55.030 --> 05:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
$500,000 which the size of the plot will
 
05:39:57.590 --> 05:39:57.600 align:start position:0%
likely be what they get in real estate
 
05:39:59.548 --> 05:39:59.558 align:start position:0%
for that transaction and so I'm
 
05:40:01.390 --> 05:40:01.400 align:start position:0%
wondering if the department ever
 
05:40:03.110 --> 05:40:03.120 align:start position:0%
recouped any of the funds beside you
 
05:40:04.830 --> 05:40:04.840 align:start position:0%
know I'm assuming the cost was greater
 
05:40:07.430 --> 05:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
than $500,000 so I'm wondering if
 
05:40:10.190 --> 05:40:10.200 align:start position:0%
the department was on the hook for that
 
05:40:12.110 --> 05:40:12.120 align:start position:0%
taxpayers were on the hook for that so
 
05:40:13.230 --> 05:40:13.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your question
 
05:40:15.110 --> 05:40:15.120 align:start position:0%
and I will have to answer that I have no
 
05:40:17.350 --> 05:40:17.360 align:start position:0%
idea uh that's in a waste division
 
05:40:19.110 --> 05:40:19.120 align:start position:0%
that's in their the super fund program
 
05:40:20.548 --> 05:40:20.558 align:start position:0%
and we would have to get somebody from
 
05:40:22.628 --> 05:40:22.638 align:start position:0%
Super fund to speak to that I think
 
05:40:23.788 --> 05:40:23.798 align:start position:0%
those are the kinds of questions that
 
05:40:25.270 --> 05:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
the committee might want to look more
 
05:40:28.750 --> 05:40:28.760 align:start position:0%
more fully into and um but in terms of
 
05:40:30.190 --> 05:40:30.200 align:start position:0%
if you'd like to know how much was spent
 
05:40:33.150 --> 05:40:33.160 align:start position:0%
on that site to date I will absolutely
 
05:40:35.788 --> 05:40:35.798 align:start position:0%
get that information sent over to
 
05:40:39.990 --> 05:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
you any other questions from Mr
 
05:40:42.230 --> 05:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
deers seeing none thank you for your
 
05:40:44.868 --> 05:40:44.878 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you have a great
 
05:40:51.110 --> 05:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:53.788 --> 05:40:53.798 align:start position:0%
Abbott Association of general
 
05:40:56.788 --> 05:40:56.798 align:start position:0%
contractors Mr
 
05:40:59.910 --> 05:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
Abbot thank you uh chairman
 
05:41:01.948 --> 05:41:01.958 align:start position:0%
committee members for the record my name
 
05:41:04.030 --> 05:41:04.040 align:start position:0%
is Gary Abbott I'm the Executive Vice
 
05:41:05.948 --> 05:41:05.958 align:start position:0%
President of the associated general
 
05:41:09.270 --> 05:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
contractors of New Hampshire I represent
 
05:41:11.590 --> 05:41:11.600 align:start position:0%
uh large commercial and industrial
 
05:41:13.150 --> 05:41:13.160 align:start position:0%
building and Highway
 
05:41:15.390 --> 05:41:15.400 align:start position:0%
contractors and I come here today in
 
05:41:16.830 --> 05:41:16.840 align:start position:0%
opposition to the
 
05:41:19.310 --> 05:41:19.320 align:start position:0%
bill the language in the bill is
 
05:41:22.110 --> 05:41:22.120 align:start position:0%
probably the first concern but let me
 
05:41:23.910 --> 05:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
understand who I
 
05:41:26.270 --> 05:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
represent in the building industry or
 
05:41:28.070 --> 05:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
Highway industry we're very familiar
 
05:41:30.590 --> 05:41:30.600 align:start position:0%
with bonds performance bonds
 
05:41:32.910 --> 05:41:32.920 align:start position:0%
construction bonds and of course the
 
05:41:35.350 --> 05:41:35.360 align:start position:0%
first knee knee-jerk reaction is this is
 
05:41:37.350 --> 05:41:37.360 align:start position:0%
just another Bond are we adding this to
 
05:41:40.590 --> 05:41:40.600 align:start position:0%
our our projects and what's the cost
 
05:41:44.110 --> 05:41:44.120 align:start position:0%
because understand what a bond is it's
 
05:41:47.270 --> 05:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
somebody has to pay for the bond for the
 
05:41:49.390 --> 05:41:49.400 align:start position:0%
coverage and the insurance company is
 
05:41:51.788 --> 05:41:51.798 align:start position:0%
taking a risk and the cost of those
 
05:41:54.628 --> 05:41:54.638 align:start position:0%
bonds depends on a lot of factors and
 
05:41:56.788 --> 05:41:56.798 align:start position:0%
what the risk factors are when you look
 
05:41:59.548 --> 05:41:59.558 align:start position:0%
at the structure of this it doesn't
 
05:42:02.670 --> 05:42:02.680 align:start position:0%
really say permitting which I heard in
 
05:42:06.510 --> 05:42:06.520 align:start position:0%
testimony prior to me it says
 
05:42:08.750 --> 05:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
licensing those are different things
 
05:42:11.030 --> 05:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of different uh parts of
 
05:42:14.670 --> 05:42:14.680 align:start position:0%
Dees that we get permits from there are
 
05:42:16.868 --> 05:42:16.878 align:start position:0%
certain sections like air resources that
 
05:42:19.708 --> 05:42:19.718 align:start position:0%
we kind of have a license or a permit to
 
05:42:22.548 --> 05:42:22.558 align:start position:0%
admit so it's a little unclear who this
 
05:42:25.750 --> 05:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
applies to and how it applies so when
 
05:42:28.350 --> 05:42:28.360 align:start position:0%
you look at that there's also a cost and
 
05:42:30.230 --> 05:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
I think you the chairman brought up a
 
05:42:32.510 --> 05:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
very good question about uh what happens
 
05:42:34.390 --> 05:42:34.400 align:start position:0%
if you can't get a bond or what happens
 
05:42:37.510 --> 05:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
if exceeds reasonable for the operation
 
05:42:39.948 --> 05:42:39.958 align:start position:0%
even to continue in New Hampshire for
 
05:42:42.990 --> 05:42:43.000 align:start position:0%
whatever it produces lot of unknowns it
 
05:42:45.670 --> 05:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
sounds like a a very easy Bill like
 
05:42:47.150 --> 05:42:47.160 align:start position:0%
you're passing a bill that's you're
 
05:42:48.750 --> 05:42:48.760 align:start position:0%
going to mandate a bond and you're fully
 
05:42:51.150 --> 05:42:51.160 align:start position:0%
protected well for how many years and
 
05:42:53.430 --> 05:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
how much does this cost and what's the
 
05:42:55.708 --> 05:42:55.718 align:start position:0%
impact on the companies so I represent
 
05:42:58.390 --> 05:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
companies that would have to pay so
 
05:43:00.670 --> 05:43:00.680 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of detail missing from
 
05:43:03.350 --> 05:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
this bill just how this would work we
 
05:43:05.788 --> 05:43:05.798 align:start position:0%
also feel like we already pay an awful
 
05:43:08.230 --> 05:43:08.240 align:start position:0%
lot of bonds that are required either
 
05:43:09.390 --> 05:43:09.400 align:start position:0%
whether they're required from the
 
05:43:12.270 --> 05:43:12.280 align:start position:0%
municipality or the state in order to
 
05:43:14.350 --> 05:43:14.360 align:start position:0%
perform construction work so we're
 
05:43:16.948 --> 05:43:16.958 align:start position:0%
already feeling like you have the
 
05:43:19.468 --> 05:43:19.478 align:start position:0%
protection of a construction
 
05:43:21.868 --> 05:43:21.878 align:start position:0%
project even through the permit process
 
05:43:24.190 --> 05:43:24.200 align:start position:0%
we're agreeing with Dees on Ser certain
 
05:43:25.750 --> 05:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
permits whether we're getting a Wetlands
 
05:43:28.670 --> 05:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
permit or any other permit and trust me
 
05:43:31.350 --> 05:43:31.360 align:start position:0%
if we fail they're going to find us and
 
05:43:33.628 --> 05:43:33.638 align:start position:0%
we're going to be in trouble so we think
 
05:43:36.430 --> 05:43:36.440 align:start position:0%
the protection is there I guess this
 
05:43:39.030 --> 05:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
bill just needs a lot more clarification
 
05:43:42.628 --> 05:43:42.638 align:start position:0%
if it is after super high risk or a
 
05:43:46.270 --> 05:43:46.280 align:start position:0%
defined group um and one of the things
 
05:43:48.788 --> 05:43:48.798 align:start position:0%
uh super vun sites anybody who's ever
 
05:43:50.948 --> 05:43:50.958 align:start position:0%
been involved in one of those if you
 
05:43:53.030 --> 05:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
touched any of those products the
 
05:43:55.548 --> 05:43:55.558 align:start position:0%
federal government's after you for money
 
05:43:59.628 --> 05:43:59.638 align:start position:0%
and so it's not it's not a a left town
 
05:44:01.990 --> 05:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm not not not involved because I
 
05:44:04.270 --> 05:44:04.280 align:start position:0%
remember some in my early days superf
 
05:44:06.708 --> 05:44:06.718 align:start position:0%
fund sites that even some of our
 
05:44:08.590 --> 05:44:08.600 align:start position:0%
contractors who move product from a
 
05:44:11.310 --> 05:44:11.320 align:start position:0%
super fund site they were all under the
 
05:44:13.310 --> 05:44:13.320 align:start position:0%
umbrella under the feds it wasn't the
 
05:44:15.788 --> 05:44:15.798 align:start position:0%
state but it was the whole super fund
 
05:44:15.798 --> 05:44:16.910 align:start position:0%
state but it was the whole super fund
site

05:44:16.910 --> 05:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
site
 
05:44:19.868 --> 05:44:19.878 align:start position:0%
so I don't think anybody's liability is
 
05:44:23.548 --> 05:44:23.558 align:start position:0%
off the hook uh under this but we just
 
05:44:26.070 --> 05:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
looked at this I think the winner is the
 
05:44:29.270 --> 05:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
insurance companies we're not so sure
 
05:44:31.270 --> 05:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
about all the other players involved in
 
05:44:34.468 --> 05:44:34.478 align:start position:0%
the process and so I'm here today that
 
05:44:35.750 --> 05:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
the the language needs to be
 
05:44:37.590 --> 05:44:37.600 align:start position:0%
dramatically changed if that's what
 
05:44:39.270 --> 05:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
you're after and know what you're
 
05:44:41.430 --> 05:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
looking for because I think there's
 
05:44:43.390 --> 05:44:43.400 align:start position:0%
going to be a lot of unintended
 
05:44:45.150 --> 05:44:45.160 align:start position:0%
consequences on people that have been
 
05:44:47.110 --> 05:44:47.120 align:start position:0%
operating for years getting either
 
05:44:49.708 --> 05:44:49.718 align:start position:0%
permits or licenses that don't need a
 
05:44:52.590 --> 05:44:52.600 align:start position:0%
further Bond so with that I would end my
 
05:44:54.750 --> 05:44:54.760 align:start position:0%
testimony and answer any
 
05:44:56.830 --> 05:44:56.840 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
05:44:59.070 --> 05:44:59.080 align:start position:0%
Kelly thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:45:02.150 --> 05:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
Mr AB for being here so my question it
 
05:45:04.150 --> 05:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
it's tangentially related and I I'm
 
05:45:05.590 --> 05:45:05.600 align:start position:0%
wondering if you'd be interested in this
 
05:45:07.830 --> 05:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
so a lot of talk recently has been about
 
05:45:09.708 --> 05:45:09.718 align:start position:0%
the amount of CND construction
 
05:45:11.868 --> 05:45:11.878 align:start position:0%
demolition waste that's ending up in
 
05:45:14.350 --> 05:45:14.360 align:start position:0%
landfills it's it's the it's a I don't
 
05:45:15.628 --> 05:45:15.638 align:start position:0%
know if it's the majority but it's close
 
05:45:17.830 --> 05:45:17.840 align:start position:0%
to the majority of waste that's going
 
05:45:20.270 --> 05:45:20.280 align:start position:0%
into the landfills currently so my
 
05:45:22.510 --> 05:45:22.520 align:start position:0%
question is if there was some type of
 
05:45:25.190 --> 05:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
waiver in this so that that like the the
 
05:45:27.070 --> 05:45:27.080 align:start position:0%
question's been asked about how do we
 
05:45:29.310 --> 05:45:29.320 align:start position:0%
get less CND waste into our land fs and
 
05:45:30.948 --> 05:45:30.958 align:start position:0%
there's plenty of programs out there
 
05:45:33.110 --> 05:45:33.120 align:start position:0%
that companies like producers are doing
 
05:45:34.948 --> 05:45:34.958 align:start position:0%
to try to recycle their own Goods they
 
05:45:36.510 --> 05:45:36.520 align:start position:0%
know how to do it but they it's how do
 
05:45:38.230 --> 05:45:38.240 align:start position:0%
we get it into their hands so if there
 
05:45:40.590 --> 05:45:40.600 align:start position:0%
was some incentive let's say like if you
 
05:45:42.270 --> 05:45:42.280 align:start position:0%
were able to cut your construction
 
05:45:44.670 --> 05:45:44.680 align:start position:0%
demolition demolition waste by 50% then
 
05:45:48.070 --> 05:45:48.080 align:start position:0%
you would have a waiver from this policy
 
05:45:49.190 --> 05:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
is is that something that you think
 
05:45:50.708 --> 05:45:50.718 align:start position:0%
could work do you
 
05:45:53.628 --> 05:45:53.638 align:start position:0%
know we are actually talking about
 
05:45:56.590 --> 05:45:56.600 align:start position:0%
um construction waste has been you know
 
05:45:56.600 --> 05:45:57.310 align:start position:0%
um construction waste has been you know
I've

05:45:57.310 --> 05:45:57.320 align:start position:0%
I've
 
05:46:00.628 --> 05:46:00.638 align:start position:0%
been after Clos I've been around here 40
 
05:46:03.150 --> 05:46:03.160 align:start position:0%
years we've talked about construction
 
05:46:05.190 --> 05:46:05.200 align:start position:0%
waste before and
 
05:46:08.110 --> 05:46:08.120 align:start position:0%
Recycling and we've been through a lot
 
05:46:10.708 --> 05:46:10.718 align:start position:0%
we've had bills that we've directed that
 
05:46:13.990 --> 05:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
we we did certain things uh glass those
 
05:46:16.310 --> 05:46:16.320 align:start position:0%
kind of things sometimes it doesn't work
 
05:46:19.750 --> 05:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
out financially or feasible and so we've
 
05:46:21.070 --> 05:46:21.080 align:start position:0%
gone through an awful lot of
 
05:46:23.110 --> 05:46:23.120 align:start position:0%
construction debris contractors want to
 
05:46:24.990 --> 05:46:25.000 align:start position:0%
be the most efficient way they can get
 
05:46:27.310 --> 05:46:27.320 align:start position:0%
rid of material as well and it all
 
05:46:30.390 --> 05:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
depends on cost and as you probably know
 
05:46:31.990 --> 05:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
you know there was a whole recycling
 
05:46:33.628 --> 05:46:33.638 align:start position:0%
effort a lot of people Recycling and
 
05:46:37.230 --> 05:46:37.240 align:start position:0%
suddenly that costs more than allinone
 
05:46:39.548 --> 05:46:39.558 align:start position:0%
so it's a complicated area I don't want
 
05:46:41.310 --> 05:46:41.320 align:start position:0%
to hear
 
05:46:43.868 --> 05:46:43.878 align:start position:0%
say we're always open to those
 
05:46:45.990 --> 05:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
suggestions but clearly what it comes
 
05:46:47.110 --> 05:46:47.120 align:start position:0%
down to is
 
05:46:49.990 --> 05:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
economics uh what I've learned over time
 
05:46:51.868 --> 05:46:51.878 align:start position:0%
you know the econ if the economics are
 
05:46:55.350 --> 05:46:55.360 align:start position:0%
there it'll happen and in some cases on
 
05:46:57.468 --> 05:46:57.478 align:start position:0%
some construction projects they save the
 
05:46:59.390 --> 05:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
brick they save other things because
 
05:47:02.910 --> 05:47:02.920 align:start position:0%
it's economical to sell the used brick
 
05:47:04.830 --> 05:47:04.840 align:start position:0%
so some of that already happens so
 
05:47:07.788 --> 05:47:07.798 align:start position:0%
construction debris gets sometimes it's
 
05:47:09.830 --> 05:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
used but I'm not so sure people
 
05:47:12.270 --> 05:47:12.280 align:start position:0%
understand when we did recycle glass our
 
05:47:14.430 --> 05:47:14.440 align:start position:0%
industry got totally involved and looked
 
05:47:17.110 --> 05:47:17.120 align:start position:0%
at it all but believe it or not we New
 
05:47:19.628 --> 05:47:19.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire doesn't produce enough glass
 
05:47:22.468 --> 05:47:22.478 align:start position:0%
to to you know to make it effective in
 
05:47:26.350 --> 05:47:26.360 align:start position:0%
using it as a product in the field so I
 
05:47:29.590 --> 05:47:29.600 align:start position:0%
I'm just giving you that my history of
 
05:47:31.468 --> 05:47:31.478 align:start position:0%
it's complicated we've looked at a lot
 
05:47:33.390 --> 05:47:33.400 align:start position:0%
of things we've even done rubber in
 
05:47:35.310 --> 05:47:35.320 align:start position:0%
roads and I can tell you the issues that
 
05:47:37.510 --> 05:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
happened there but construction's always
 
05:47:39.190 --> 05:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
looking for the best way to use
 
05:47:42.150 --> 05:47:42.160 align:start position:0%
materials and save so I I think that's
 
05:47:43.910 --> 05:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
the same on the town end to try to
 
05:47:45.750 --> 05:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
eliminate how much it costs that's
 
05:47:48.310 --> 05:47:48.320 align:start position:0%
coming in that uh you know is costing
 
05:47:51.830 --> 05:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
you and uh you know taking care of
 
05:47:55.390 --> 05:47:55.400 align:start position:0%
waste any other questions for the
 
05:47:57.590 --> 05:47:57.600 align:start position:0%

calling uh the hearing on HB 1709 FM to
 
06:01:16.548 --> 06:01:16.558 align:start position:0%
order establishing a tax on land used
 
06:01:20.670 --> 06:01:20.680 align:start position:0%
for carbon credits our first speaker is
 
06:01:23.670 --> 06:01:23.680 align:start position:0%

catch you up
 
06:01:43.628 --> 06:01:43.638 align:start position:0%
there okay I am representative Aman
 
06:01:45.270 --> 06:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
Kelly representing Berlin Carol
 
06:01:47.310 --> 06:01:47.320 align:start position:0%
Jefferson and Whitefield although there
 
06:01:49.270 --> 06:01:49.280 align:start position:0%
is a certain situation in Northern Coos
 
06:01:50.990 --> 06:01:51.000 align:start position:0%
making news stories right now I want to
 
06:01:52.310 --> 06:01:52.320 align:start position:0%
start by saying that this bill is not
 
06:01:54.788 --> 06:01:54.798 align:start position:0%
meant to deal with that issue that issue
 
06:01:56.390 --> 06:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
highlighted an important question
 
06:01:57.788 --> 06:01:57.798 align:start position:0%
however and I hope that this bill will
 
06:01:59.750 --> 06:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
open a conversation on how to begin to
 
06:02:02.910 --> 06:02:02.920 align:start position:0%
answer that first a little history the
 
06:02:05.070 --> 06:02:05.080 align:start position:0%
last line of part two Article 5 of the
 
06:02:07.270 --> 06:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
State Constitution reads for the purpose
 
06:02:09.788 --> 06:02:09.798 align:start position:0%
of encouraging conservation of the
 
06:02:11.868 --> 06:02:11.878 align:start position:0%
forest resources of the state the
 
06:02:13.548 --> 06:02:13.558 align:start position:0%
general court May provide special
 
06:02:15.670 --> 06:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
assessments rates and taxes on growing
 
06:02:18.270 --> 06:02:18.280 align:start position:0%
wood and Timber that line was added in
 
06:02:21.230 --> 06:02:21.240 align:start position:0%
1942 following years of debate on the
 
06:02:24.390 --> 06:02:24.400 align:start position:0%
value of this growing timber at the time
 
06:02:26.350 --> 06:02:26.360 align:start position:0%
the state had only three main sources of
 
06:02:29.430 --> 06:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
revenue alcohol tobacco and horse racing
 
06:02:30.868 --> 06:02:30.878 align:start position:0%
whatever the state couldn't fund with
 
06:02:32.708 --> 06:02:32.718 align:start position:0%
that Revenue was delegated to towns to
 
06:02:35.468 --> 06:02:35.478 align:start position:0%
fund through property taxes as spending

on these three vices diminished during
 
06:02:38.430 --> 06:02:38.440 align:start position:0%
the Great Depression and nearly
 
06:02:40.510 --> 06:02:40.520 align:start position:0%
disappeared during World War II towns
 
06:02:42.230 --> 06:02:42.240 align:start position:0%
were left on their own to Levy higher
 
06:02:44.628 --> 06:02:44.638 align:start position:0%
and higher property taxes at the time
 
06:02:46.510 --> 06:02:46.520 align:start position:0%
the value of Timber on a property was
 
06:02:48.590 --> 06:02:48.600 align:start position:0%
considered part of the assessment it
 
06:02:50.070 --> 06:02:50.080 align:start position:0%
meant that Forest land was only
 
06:02:51.830 --> 06:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
desirable in the year or two before it
 
06:02:53.948 --> 06:02:53.958 align:start position:0%
was harvested it also meant that younger
 
06:02:55.788 --> 06:02:55.798 align:start position:0%
trees were more of a liability than an
 
06:02:57.628 --> 06:02:57.638 align:start position:0%
asset and so when Cuts were done the
 
06:02:59.948 --> 06:02:59.958 align:start position:0%
whole forest was brought to the ground
 
06:03:01.350 --> 06:03:01.360 align:start position:0%

06:03:07.910 --> 06:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
era recognizing that these practices
 
06:03:09.590 --> 06:03:09.600 align:start position:0%
were a serious threat to long-term
 
06:03:11.670 --> 06:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
Forest management goals the state acted
 
06:03:14.190 --> 06:03:14.200 align:start position:0%
and ratified the amendment with a 71%
 
06:03:16.750 --> 06:03:16.760 align:start position:0%
Statewide vote it would be another seven
 
06:03:18.590 --> 06:03:18.600 align:start position:0%
years before the legislature approved
 
06:03:20.990 --> 06:03:21.000 align:start position:0%

06:03:27.390 --> 06:03:27.400 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of that bill makes
 
06:03:30.590 --> 06:03:30.600 align:start position:0%
clear the legislature's intent it is the
 
06:03:32.310 --> 06:03:32.320 align:start position:0%
declared purpose of this act to
 
06:03:34.110 --> 06:03:34.120 align:start position:0%
encourage conservation of the forest
 
06:03:36.190 --> 06:03:36.200 align:start position:0%

06:03:37.910 --> 06:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
growing wood and Timber from the yearly
 
06:03:40.110 --> 06:03:40.120 align:start position:0%
burden of local property taxes and
 
06:03:42.830 --> 06:03:42.840 align:start position:0%
substituting a yield tax so as to give
 
06:03:44.750 --> 06:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
an incentive to the owners of standing
 
06:03:46.708 --> 06:03:46.718 align:start position:0%
Timber to abandon destructive cutting
 
06:03:48.788 --> 06:03:48.798 align:start position:0%
practices in favor of long-range Forest
 
06:03:50.830 --> 06:03:50.840 align:start position:0%

06:04:35.230 --> 06:04:35.240 align:start position:0%
game at the time of its passage in 1949
 
06:04:37.708 --> 06:04:37.718 align:start position:0%
the state's Forest cover was 84% and
 
06:04:40.030 --> 06:04:40.040 align:start position:0%
with a current rate of around 82% we can
 
06:04:42.708 --> 06:04:42.718 align:start position:0%
say it was a relative success that bill
 
06:04:44.670 --> 06:04:44.680 align:start position:0%
included two key Provisions that should
 
06:04:46.350 --> 06:04:46.360 align:start position:0%
help us understand its context for
 
06:04:49.430 --> 06:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
today's hearing first it included a 30%
 
06:04:51.150 --> 06:04:51.160 align:start position:0%
tax break for land owners who could
 
06:04:52.670 --> 06:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
prove they were using good Forest
 
06:04:55.628 --> 06:04:55.638 align:start position:0%
management practices in 1973 that
 
06:04:57.190 --> 06:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
provision would be supplanted by the
 
06:04:59.868 --> 06:04:59.878 align:start position:0%
current use program that we have today
 
06:05:01.990 --> 06:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
the second provision from the 1949
 
06:05:03.788 --> 06:05:03.798 align:start position:0%
Timber tax bill and the one that is most
 
06:05:05.350 --> 06:05:05.360 align:start position:0%
important for this hearing was the
 
06:05:07.590 --> 06:05:07.600 align:start position:0%
creation of a state fund to offset the
 
06:05:10.150 --> 06:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
loss of property taxes from the new bill
 
06:05:11.990 --> 06:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
if the town's tax collection dropped
 
06:05:15.190 --> 06:05:15.200 align:start position:0%
below the 5e pre- timber tax average
 
06:05:16.548 --> 06:05:16.558 align:start position:0%
then the state would loan them the
 
06:05:18.750 --> 06:05:18.760 align:start position:0%
difference the town would then reimburse
 
06:05:20.708 --> 06:05:20.718 align:start position:0%
the state in future years when Timber
 
06:05:23.070 --> 06:05:23.080 align:start position:0%
tax collection led to a surplus
 
06:05:25.390 --> 06:05:25.400 align:start position:0%
Revenue the fund was meant to be self-
 
06:05:27.750 --> 06:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
sustaining as towns paid in some years
 
06:05:29.990 --> 06:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
and withdrew in others this clearly
 
06:05:31.990 --> 06:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
shows that the timber taxes were meant
 
06:05:34.468 --> 06:05:34.478 align:start position:0%
to merely act as a delayed property tax
 
06:05:36.548 --> 06:05:36.558 align:start position:0%
device they are essentially property
 
06:05:38.628 --> 06:05:38.638 align:start position:0%
taxes collected when the timber is
 
06:05:41.510 --> 06:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
harvested okay so history done the next
 
06:05:43.070 --> 06:05:43.080 align:start position:0%
step in understanding today's bill is
 
06:05:45.548 --> 06:05:45.558 align:start position:0%
grasping the concept of carbon credits I
 
06:05:47.230 --> 06:05:47.240 align:start position:0%
think it first helps to break the system
 
06:05:49.670 --> 06:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
into two categories the regulated market
 
06:05:51.830 --> 06:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
and the voluntary Market the regulated
 
06:05:53.510 --> 06:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
market are systems imposed by
 
06:05:55.190 --> 06:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
governments these are often referred to
 
06:05:57.590 --> 06:05:57.600 align:start position:0%
as cap and trade programs every business
 
06:05:59.310 --> 06:05:59.320 align:start position:0%
in a state or a country is given a
 
06:06:01.230 --> 06:06:01.240 align:start position:0%
yearly cap on their emissions they can
 
06:06:02.990 --> 06:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
either lower their own emissions below
 
06:06:05.070 --> 06:06:05.080 align:start position:0%
that cap or pay other businesses to
 
06:06:06.788 --> 06:06:06.798 align:start position:0%
offset their emissions by doing things
 
06:06:08.468 --> 06:06:08.478 align:start position:0%
that re remove carbon from the
 
06:06:11.190 --> 06:06:11.200 align:start position:0%
atmosphere each year the cap is lowered
 
06:06:13.510 --> 06:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
the demand for offsets Rises and with
 
06:06:16.350 --> 06:06:16.360 align:start position:0%
that so does the value California has
 
06:06:18.670 --> 06:06:18.680 align:start position:0%
the only regulated market here in the US
 
06:06:20.270 --> 06:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
but there are many other markets around
 
06:06:23.110 --> 06:06:23.120 align:start position:0%
the world the voluntary Market is much
 
06:06:25.310 --> 06:06:25.320 align:start position:0%
more complex and harder to grasp due to
 
06:06:27.868 --> 06:06:27.878 align:start position:0%
the rising importance of ES G metrics
 
06:06:29.670 --> 06:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
investors have placed increasing Demand
 
06:06:32.070 --> 06:06:32.080 align:start position:0%
on large large corporations to prove
 
06:06:33.750 --> 06:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
their ability to recognize how their own
 
06:06:36.150 --> 06:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
emissions are affecting our climate for
 
06:06:38.190 --> 06:06:38.200 align:start position:0%
many large companies like Delta or Exxon
 
06:06:40.270 --> 06:06:40.280 align:start position:0%
Mobile this has meant voluntary funding
 
06:06:42.468 --> 06:06:42.478 align:start position:0%
program project voluntarily funding
 
06:06:44.430 --> 06:06:44.440 align:start position:0%
projects that purport to fight climate
 
06:06:46.468 --> 06:06:46.478 align:start position:0%
change this has led to a whole new
 
06:06:49.510 --> 06:06:49.520 align:start position:0%

06:07:11.628 --> 06:07:11.638 align:start position:0%
as emissions reduction tons and are
 
06:07:14.430 --> 06:07:14.440 align:start position:0%
equivalent to removing one ton of CO2
 
06:07:16.510 --> 06:07:16.520 align:start position:0%
from the atmosphere this could be
 
06:07:18.070 --> 06:07:18.080 align:start position:0%
something like the capturing and reuse

of landfill methane gas which would
 
06:07:22.110 --> 06:07:22.120 align:start position:0%

06:08:47.310 --> 06:08:47.320 align:start position:0%
be captured by the changes in Forest
 
06:08:49.230 --> 06:08:49.240 align:start position:0%
management practices they are
 
06:08:51.708 --> 06:08:51.718 align:start position:0%
proposing so we have a history of of the
 
06:08:53.548 --> 06:08:53.558 align:start position:0%
Timber tax and we have a basic grasp of
 
06:08:55.150 --> 06:08:55.160 align:start position:0%
these Forest carbon credits so now let's
 
06:08:57.230 --> 06:08:57.240 align:start position:0%
talk about why we're here today these
 
06:08:58.590 --> 06:08:58.600 align:start position:0%
carbon credits which are wholly
 
06:09:00.670 --> 06:09:00.680 align:start position:0%
conceived bought and sold outside the
 
06:09:02.548 --> 06:09:02.558 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire are nonetheless
 
06:09:04.868 --> 06:09:04.878 align:start position:0%
generated here and directly offset
 
06:09:07.310 --> 06:09:07.320 align:start position:0%
traditional harvesting of Timber without
 
06:09:09.270 --> 06:09:09.280 align:start position:0%
a new mechanism the delayed property
 
06:09:11.468 --> 06:09:11.478 align:start position:0%
taxes on these properties will never be
 
06:09:13.670 --> 06:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
collected and therefore local property
 
06:09:15.390 --> 06:09:15.400 align:start position:0%
tax players will be subsidizing the
 
06:09:17.468 --> 06:09:17.478 align:start position:0%
production of something created entirely
 
06:09:19.270 --> 06:09:19.280 align:start position:0%
for the benefit of those outside the
 
06:09:21.788 --> 06:09:21.798 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire we must tackle
 
06:09:23.670 --> 06:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
this issue head-on and develop a system
 
06:09:25.708 --> 06:09:25.718 align:start position:0%
that fairly balances Forest carbon with
 
06:09:27.468 --> 06:09:27.478 align:start position:0%
traditional Timber practi
 
06:09:29.670 --> 06:09:29.680 align:start position:0%
practices one of the arguments given in
 
06:09:31.310 --> 06:09:31.320 align:start position:0%
the most recent case making the local
 
06:09:32.868 --> 06:09:32.878 align:start position:0%
news was that carbon credits were
 
06:09:34.548 --> 06:09:34.558 align:start position:0%
currently much more profitable than
 
06:09:36.350 --> 06:09:36.360 align:start position:0%
harvesting and selling the timber no
 
06:09:38.150 --> 06:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
doubt they are because in this current
 
06:09:39.750 --> 06:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
system the government is subsidizing
 
06:09:42.708 --> 06:09:42.718 align:start position:0%
them this activity is only set to become
 
06:09:44.830 --> 06:09:44.840 align:start position:0%
even more prevalent in New Hampshire as
 
06:09:46.548 --> 06:09:46.558 align:start position:0%
caps and regulated markets get lower
 
06:09:48.510 --> 06:09:48.520 align:start position:0%
each year and other companies adopt
 
06:09:50.670 --> 06:09:50.680 align:start position:0%
other countries adopt similar systems
 
06:09:52.310 --> 06:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
the value of credits will continue to
 
06:09:54.590 --> 06:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
rise exponentially additionally the
 
06:09:56.350 --> 06:09:56.360 align:start position:0%
complexity of calculations traditionally
 
06:09:58.590 --> 06:09:58.600 align:start position:0%
limit generators to lot sizes of 100
 
06:10:01.070 --> 06:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
acres or more but just last August the
 
06:10:02.670 --> 06:10:02.680 align:start position:0%
federal government announced $150
 
06:10:05.190 --> 06:10:05.200 align:start position:0%
million in funds to include lot sizes
 
06:10:07.830 --> 06:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
down to 50 acres Additionally the nature
 
06:10:09.230 --> 06:10:09.240 align:start position:0%
conservancy and others have created
 
06:10:10.868 --> 06:10:10.878 align:start position:0%
their own program on the voluntary
 
06:10:12.990 --> 06:10:13.000 align:start position:0%
Market to pull together many small land
 
06:10:14.708 --> 06:10:14.718 align:start position:0%
owners in a fashion similar to how
 
06:10:17.628 --> 06:10:17.638 align:start position:0%
subprime mortgages are bundled and sold
 
06:10:19.270 --> 06:10:19.280 align:start position:0%
what I'm proposing in this bill is my
 
06:10:21.230 --> 06:10:21.240 align:start position:0%
first attempt at this I am not a lawyer
 
06:10:24.110 --> 06:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
or a tax expert it took legislators six
 
06:10:25.948 --> 06:10:25.958 align:start position:0%
years to create the first timber tax and
 
06:10:28.590 --> 06:10:28.600 align:start position:0%
my only hope is that we can beat that so
 
06:10:30.590 --> 06:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
here's what I'm proposing and thank you
 
06:10:33.270 --> 06:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
for bearing with me uh I want to mirror
 
06:10:35.390 --> 06:10:35.400 align:start position:0%
the timber tax as closely as possible
 
06:10:36.990 --> 06:10:37.000 align:start position:0%
the Constitution gives us the clear
 
06:10:38.948 --> 06:10:38.958 align:start position:0%
right as a legislature to tax growing
 
06:10:41.270 --> 06:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
trees my proposal can fit neatly in the
 
06:10:44.110 --> 06:10:44.120 align:start position:0%
same RSA 79 a company looking to
 
06:10:45.830 --> 06:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
generate an emissions reduction ton on
 
06:10:47.670 --> 06:10:47.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Forest land would file an
 
06:10:49.150 --> 06:10:49.160 align:start position:0%
attent to generate with the local
 
06:10:50.948 --> 06:10:50.958 align:start position:0%
assessing official just as they would at
 
06:10:54.070 --> 06:10:54.080 align:start position:0%
pa7 intent to cut today the exact nature
 
06:10:55.548 --> 06:10:55.558 align:start position:0%
and language of that document would be
 
06:10:57.030 --> 06:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
decided by the division of forest and
 
06:10:59.270 --> 06:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
lands along with the intent to generate
 
06:11:01.110 --> 06:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
they would submit the ghg pro the
 
06:11:03.110 --> 06:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas pro project plan that
 
06:11:04.590 --> 06:11:04.600 align:start position:0%
they are already producing for their
 
06:11:06.868 --> 06:11:06.878 align:start position:0%
certification Authority those documents
 
06:11:08.390 --> 06:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
would be first reviewed by the local
 
06:11:10.110 --> 06:11:10.120 align:start position:0%
assessing official and then forwarded to
 
06:11:12.150 --> 06:11:12.160 align:start position:0%
the division of forest and Lance both
 
06:11:13.830 --> 06:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
the local and state officials would have
 
06:11:15.510 --> 06:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to review and challenge
 
06:11:17.350 --> 06:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
the numbers in their reports just as
 
06:11:19.628 --> 06:11:19.638 align:start position:0%
they do with the intent to cut the local
 
06:11:21.548 --> 06:11:21.558 align:start position:0%
officials would then assess a yearly tax
 
06:11:23.628 --> 06:11:23.638 align:start position:0%
based on the growth claimed in the ghg
 
06:11:25.670 --> 06:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
project plan this would be the growth
 
06:11:28.350 --> 06:11:28.360 align:start position:0%
above the Baseline laid out in the plan
 
06:11:29.948 --> 06:11:29.958 align:start position:0%
the project plan also defines a
 
06:11:31.350 --> 06:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
crediting period in the case of the
 
06:11:33.590 --> 06:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
California Market that is 100 years but
 
06:11:35.590 --> 06:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
in other cases that can be much shorter
 
06:11:37.270 --> 06:11:37.280 align:start position:0%
the tax would be assessed on a total
 
06:11:39.948 --> 06:11:39.958 align:start position:0%
board feet of growth over the pole
 
06:11:42.670 --> 06:11:42.680 align:start position:0%
project divided by 50 or the crediting
 
06:11:45.230 --> 06:11:45.240 align:start position:0%
period whichever is less this is based
 
06:11:46.868 --> 06:11:46.878 align:start position:0%
on the fact that most areas will go
 
06:11:48.708 --> 06:11:48.718 align:start position:0%
through an approximately 50-year growth
 
06:11:51.190 --> 06:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
rotation so a 100-year crediting period
 
06:11:53.230 --> 06:11:53.240 align:start position:0%
would mean giving up two Timber tax
 
06:11:56.110 --> 06:11:56.120 align:start position:0%
collections essentially the actual tax
 
06:11:57.910 --> 06:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
amount would fluctuate each year because
 
06:11:59.150 --> 06:11:59.160 align:start position:0%
it would be charged on the current
 
06:12:01.070 --> 06:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
stumpage rates published by the division
 
06:12:03.150 --> 06:12:03.160 align:start position:0%
of forest and lands essentially my
 
06:12:05.030 --> 06:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
thought is that widespread adoption of
 
06:12:06.830 --> 06:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
credit generation would lower the
 
06:12:08.670 --> 06:12:08.680 align:start position:0%
availability of Timber and likely would
 
06:12:10.670 --> 06:12:10.680 align:start position:0%
lead to an increase in the average price
 
06:12:13.468 --> 06:12:13.478 align:start position:0%
of stumpage as stumpage rates rise the
 
06:12:16.230 --> 06:12:16.240 align:start position:0%
tax would adjust to reflect that this
 
06:12:18.430 --> 06:12:18.440 align:start position:0%
should naturally work to level the
 
06:12:20.110 --> 06:12:20.120 align:start position:0%
playing field between generation and
 
06:12:22.270 --> 06:12:22.280 align:start position:0%
cutting leading to a smooth transition
 
06:12:24.310 --> 06:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
transition and avoiding a rapid collapse
 
06:12:26.708 --> 06:12:26.718 align:start position:0%
of the Timber harvesting industry the
 
06:12:29.230 --> 06:12:29.240 align:start position:0%
remaining segments of RSA 79 would apply
 
06:12:31.110 --> 06:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
including the parts about doomage for
 
06:12:32.750 --> 06:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
those unaware doomage is the penalty for
 
06:12:34.548 --> 06:12:34.558 align:start position:0%
submitting inaccurate information to the
 
06:12:36.468 --> 06:12:36.478 align:start position:0%
assessing official there would be
 
06:12:38.230 --> 06:12:38.240 align:start position:0%
another incentive for generators to go
 
06:12:40.230 --> 06:12:40.240 align:start position:0%
along with this in the current Timber
 
06:12:42.708 --> 06:12:42.718 align:start position:0%
tax law as it's written today towns and
 
06:12:44.670 --> 06:12:44.680 align:start position:0%
cities have the right to preemptively
 
06:12:47.070 --> 06:12:47.080 align:start position:0%
apply the timber tax if a town believes
 
06:12:49.030 --> 06:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
that an owner isn't harvesting a
 
06:12:51.110 --> 06:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
property to the historical level they
 
06:12:53.150 --> 06:12:53.160 align:start position:0%
may apply a Timber tax to the entire
 
06:12:55.750 --> 06:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
parcel that Timber tax is then credited
 
06:12:58.430 --> 06:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
when the timber is eventually harvested
 
06:13:00.590 --> 06:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
under my bill as long as an owner was
 
06:13:02.510 --> 06:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
paying the yearly generating tax the
 
06:13:04.548 --> 06:13:04.558 align:start position:0%
town could not apply the preemptive
 
06:13:06.948 --> 06:13:06.958 align:start position:0%
Timber tax it's an incentive to be part
 
06:13:09.868 --> 06:13:09.878 align:start position:0%
of our new system I'm aware that there
 
06:13:11.948 --> 06:13:11.958 align:start position:0%
are flaws in this proposal many of the
 
06:13:13.510 --> 06:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
places that have the most Forest have
 
06:13:15.788 --> 06:13:15.798 align:start position:0%
the fewest people and therefore the lack
 
06:13:18.110 --> 06:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
lack the expertise to scrutinize complex
 
06:13:20.468 --> 06:13:20.478 align:start position:0%
mathematical documents we would be
 
06:13:22.030 --> 06:13:22.040 align:start position:0%
relying on professionals at the state
 
06:13:24.270 --> 06:13:24.280 align:start position:0%
level to sniff out Bad actors much as
 
06:13:26.670 --> 06:13:26.680 align:start position:0%
they do now with audits on logging
 
06:13:28.788 --> 06:13:28.798 align:start position:0%
operations this will likely take a whole
 
06:13:30.230 --> 06:13:30.240 align:start position:0%
new position at the office with an
 
06:13:31.708 --> 06:13:31.718 align:start position:0%
expertise different from traditional
 
06:13:34.350 --> 06:13:34.360 align:start position:0%
forest rangers I'm also aware that not
 
06:13:36.310 --> 06:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
all project plans requirements are the
 
06:13:39.310 --> 06:13:39.320 align:start position:0%
same especially on the voluntary Market
 
06:13:41.150 --> 06:13:41.160 align:start position:0%
but I believe that if we are going to
 
06:13:43.270 --> 06:13:43.280 align:start position:0%
allow resources in our state to be used
 
06:13:45.110 --> 06:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
for the exclusive benefit of foreign
 
06:13:47.190 --> 06:13:47.200 align:start position:0%
companies then we should set the rules
 
06:13:49.230 --> 06:13:49.240 align:start position:0%
and they should learn to play with them
 
06:13:50.750 --> 06:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
there are forests all over the world
 
06:13:52.070 --> 06:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
where they can spend their money we
 
06:13:53.390 --> 06:13:53.400 align:start position:0%
should be courting the buyers who are
 
06:13:55.270 --> 06:13:55.280 align:start position:0%
willing to rise to our
 
06:13:58.350 --> 06:13:58.360 align:start position:0%
standards I'm not sure if that 10% rate
 
06:14:00.310 --> 06:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
in the bill is the appropriate number
 
06:14:01.948 --> 06:14:01.958 align:start position:0%
when the original Timber tax was passed
 
06:14:04.070 --> 06:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
in 1949 a commission was established
 
06:14:07.628 --> 06:14:07.638 align:start position:0%
that ran from 1951 to 1953 to establish
 
06:14:10.190 --> 06:14:10.200 align:start position:0%
whether their original number accurately
 
06:14:12.750 --> 06:14:12.760 align:start position:0%
offset the loss in property taxes we
 
06:14:14.590 --> 06:14:14.600 align:start position:0%
will most definitely need the same type
 
06:14:16.708 --> 06:14:16.718 align:start position:0%
of commission this time around we will
 
06:14:18.910 --> 06:14:18.920 align:start position:0%
also likely need to assess how this new
 
06:14:21.070 --> 06:14:21.080 align:start position:0%
system fits into our current system
 
06:14:23.390 --> 06:14:23.400 align:start position:0%
system of current use many of these
 
06:14:24.990 --> 06:14:25.000 align:start position:0%
credit agreements include Provisions
 
06:14:27.030 --> 06:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
that limit recreational use on the land
 
06:14:29.350 --> 06:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
especially motorized Recreation and with
 
06:14:31.868 --> 06:14:31.878 align:start position:0%
the OHV and snowmobile use in this state
 
06:14:33.750 --> 06:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
being so important for tourism we need
 
06:14:35.750 --> 06:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
to examine that issue and whether carbon
 
06:14:38.670 --> 06:14:38.680 align:start position:0%
credit generation deserves that subsidy
 
06:14:40.430 --> 06:14:40.440 align:start position:0%
I have another bill before a different
 
06:14:43.270 --> 06:14:43.280 align:start position:0%
committee to examine just that if we do
 
06:14:44.948 --> 06:14:44.958 align:start position:0%
nothing more this year I would ask that
 
06:14:46.708 --> 06:14:46.718 align:start position:0%
we pass the intent to generate portion
 
06:14:48.750 --> 06:14:48.760 align:start position:0%
of the bill we need to give lawmakers
 
06:14:50.990 --> 06:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
and the division of forest and lands the
 
06:14:52.948 --> 06:14:52.958 align:start position:0%
the statistics to understand the current
 
06:14:55.510 --> 06:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
landscape with so many markets out there
 
06:14:57.390 --> 06:14:57.400 align:start position:0%
it is currently impossible for us to
 
06:14:59.070 --> 06:14:59.080 align:start position:0%
know how many acres of forest land here
 
06:15:00.510 --> 06:15:00.520 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire are currently under
 
06:15:02.430 --> 06:15:02.440 align:start position:0%
these restrictive agreements and for how
 
06:15:04.628 --> 06:15:04.638 align:start position:0%
long that is precisely why the fiscal
 
06:15:06.390 --> 06:15:06.400 align:start position:0%
note on this bill is unable to give any
 
06:15:09.110 --> 06:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
insight on projected Revenue at the same
 
06:15:10.788 --> 06:15:10.798 align:start position:0%
time the division of forest and lands
 
06:15:12.670 --> 06:15:12.680 align:start position:0%
has extremely accurate numbers on
 
06:15:14.468 --> 06:15:14.478 align:start position:0%
traditional harvesting operations
 
06:15:16.190 --> 06:15:16.200 align:start position:0%
because we recognize that those numbers
 
06:15:19.270 --> 06:15:19.280 align:start position:0%
are important to protecting our forest
 
06:15:21.590 --> 06:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
resources in the best interest of this
 
06:15:24.070 --> 06:15:24.080 align:start position:0%
state I apologize again for being up
 
06:15:25.750 --> 06:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
here for so long it's an extremely
 
06:15:27.750 --> 06:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
complex topic that has taken me months
 
06:15:29.788 --> 06:15:29.798 align:start position:0%
to grasp and I know that I am still just
 
06:15:32.030 --> 06:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
touching the surface although I am happy
 
06:15:33.670 --> 06:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
to answer your questions now in the
 
06:15:35.270 --> 06:15:35.280 align:start position:0%
interest of giving others time to speak
 
06:15:36.590 --> 06:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
today I would ask that you might hold
 
06:15:38.270 --> 06:15:38.280 align:start position:0%
them for a time outside this hearing or
 
06:15:40.350 --> 06:15:40.360 align:start position:0%
possibly a future hearing on this topic
 
06:15:41.628 --> 06:15:41.638 align:start position:0%
many of these people have traveled a
 
06:15:43.070 --> 06:15:43.080 align:start position:0%
long way through horrible weather and
 
06:15:44.830 --> 06:15:44.840 align:start position:0%
many did so yesterday for another
 
06:15:45.948 --> 06:15:45.958 align:start position:0%
committee but were denied the
 
06:15:48.390 --> 06:15:48.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak due to lack of time
 
06:15:49.708 --> 06:15:49.718 align:start position:0%
I want to be sure that we can hear from
 
06:15:55.110 --> 06:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:55.120 --> 06:15:56.910 align:start position:0%

thank you representative harb and
 
06:16:46.990 --> 06:16:47.000 align:start position:0%
representative Rulo uh for the
 
06:16:50.510 --> 06:16:50.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify on HB 1709
 
06:16:52.150 --> 06:16:52.160 align:start position:0%
establishing a tax on land used for
 
06:16:52.160 --> 06:16:53.070 align:start position:0%
establishing a tax on land used for
carbon

06:16:53.070 --> 06:16:53.080 align:start position:0%
carbon
 
06:16:55.628 --> 06:16:55.638 align:start position:0%
credits uh for the record again I spoke
 
06:16:57.628 --> 06:16:57.638 align:start position:0%
with all you earlier today my name is

Patrick Hackley I'm the state Forester
 
06:17:01.510 --> 06:17:01.520 align:start position:0%
and the director for the New Hampshire
 
06:17:03.350 --> 06:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
division of forest and lands we're part
 
06:17:04.868 --> 06:17:04.878 align:start position:0%
of the Department of Natural and
 
06:17:04.878 --> 06:17:07.350 align:start position:0%
of the Department of Natural and
cultural

06:17:07.350 --> 06:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:10.948 --> 06:17:10.958 align:start position:0%
resources um we we do not have a formal
 
06:17:12.910 --> 06:17:12.920 align:start position:0%
position on House Bill 1709 but we do
 
06:17:15.070 --> 06:17:15.080 align:start position:0%
have a few concerns which I'll Express I
 
06:17:16.788 --> 06:17:16.798 align:start position:0%
do have to say a thank you to
 
06:17:19.830 --> 06:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
representative Aman Kelly for offering
 
06:17:21.590 --> 06:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
an exceptional background to his
 
06:17:23.830 --> 06:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
thinking behind this bill that was
 
06:17:24.750 --> 06:17:24.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we didn't have an
 
06:17:26.310 --> 06:17:26.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get that before before I
 
06:17:29.990 --> 06:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
made my testimony so um I I have a a
 
06:17:32.430 --> 06:17:32.440 align:start position:0%
better understanding of how hard he
 
06:17:35.390 --> 06:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
worked on this and um I'm sure we'll
 
06:17:37.230 --> 06:17:37.240 align:start position:0%
have conversations after this this
 
06:17:40.030 --> 06:17:40.040 align:start position:0%
Committee hearing um just for a little
 
06:17:41.230 --> 06:17:41.240 align:start position:0%
bit of background which I don't believe
 
06:17:42.510 --> 06:17:42.520 align:start position:0%
I gave this morning the division of
 
06:17:44.628 --> 06:17:44.638 align:start position:0%
forest lands is the state agency charged
 
06:17:46.390 --> 06:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
with the execution of all matters
 
06:17:49.430 --> 06:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
pertaining to forestry Forest management
 
06:17:51.190 --> 06:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
and Forest lands within the jurisdiction
 
06:17:53.030 --> 06:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
of the state one of our key
 
06:17:54.708 --> 06:17:54.718 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to protect our natural
 
06:17:56.468 --> 06:17:56.478 align:start position:0%
resources for the benefits of the state
 
06:17:58.310 --> 06:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
citizens visitors and the forest
 
06:17:58.320 --> 06:17:59.430 align:start position:0%
citizens visitors and the forest
products

06:17:59.430 --> 06:17:59.440 align:start position:0%
products
 
06:18:02.350 --> 06:18:02.360 align:start position:0%
industry I understand the intent and and
 
06:18:05.830 --> 06:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
again I'm I'm going to riff off of uh
 
06:18:07.590 --> 06:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly's comments a little
 
06:18:10.190 --> 06:18:10.200 align:start position:0%
bit I understand that this this bill was
 
06:18:12.990 --> 06:18:13.000 align:start position:0%
inspired by uh the need to address the
 
06:18:14.590 --> 06:18:14.600 align:start position:0%
participation of landowners in carbon
 
06:18:16.868 --> 06:18:16.878 align:start position:0%
credit programs that could result in the
 
06:18:18.788 --> 06:18:18.798 align:start position:0%
potential loss of Timber tax revenue due
 
06:18:20.590 --> 06:18:20.600 align:start position:0%
to reduced
 
06:18:23.230 --> 06:18:23.240 align:start position:0%
harvesting the bill would enable towns
 
06:18:25.190 --> 06:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
to Levy taxes on landowners who sell
 
06:18:27.430 --> 06:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
carbon credits and instead of Timber
 
06:18:28.990 --> 06:18:29.000 align:start position:0%
which has historically been a subject to
 
06:18:31.310 --> 06:18:31.320 align:start position:0%
a severance tax under RSA
 
06:18:34.830 --> 06:18:34.840 align:start position:0%
79a uh of which a great history was just
 
06:18:36.948 --> 06:18:36.958 align:start position:0%
presented to you by representative Kelly
 
06:18:38.270 --> 06:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
uh landowner enrollment and carbon
 
06:18:40.628 --> 06:18:40.638 align:start position:0%
credit programs is still in its early
 
06:18:43.430 --> 06:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
stages however there is valid concern
 
06:18:45.230 --> 06:18:45.240 align:start position:0%
that Timber tax revenue may be
 
06:18:46.628 --> 06:18:46.638 align:start position:0%
diminished over time should an
 
06:18:48.270 --> 06:18:48.280 align:start position:0%
increasing number of land owners choose
 
06:18:50.150 --> 06:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
to generate carbon credits rather than
 
06:18:52.830 --> 06:18:52.840 align:start position:0%
Harvest Timber acknowledging this new
 
06:18:54.548 --> 06:18:54.558 align:start position:0%
Revenue source to land owners and its a
 
06:18:57.788 --> 06:18:57.798 align:start position:0%
potential effect on possibly depressing
 
06:18:59.310 --> 06:18:59.320 align:start position:0%
tax revenues I wish to make the
 
06:18:59.320 --> 06:19:01.270 align:start position:0%
tax revenues I wish to make the
following

06:19:01.270 --> 06:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
following
 
06:19:03.190 --> 06:19:03.200 align:start position:0%
observations uh the situation that
 
06:19:05.430 --> 06:19:05.440 align:start position:0%
inspired this bill in Pittsburgh with
 
06:19:08.030 --> 06:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
the state's largest private landowner um
 
06:19:10.750 --> 06:19:10.760 align:start position:0%
is still unresolved under the terms of
 
06:19:12.750 --> 06:19:12.760 align:start position:0%
the state held conservation easement
 
06:19:15.350 --> 06:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
which our department monitors the
 
06:19:16.910 --> 06:19:16.920 align:start position:0%
landowner must submit their 10-year
 
06:19:19.190 --> 06:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
Forest management plan to our agency for
 
06:19:20.468 --> 06:19:20.478 align:start position:0%
review and
 
06:19:22.788 --> 06:19:22.798 align:start position:0%
approval that is in compliance with the
 
06:19:25.230 --> 06:19:25.240 align:start position:0%
conservation easement while the land
 
06:19:26.430 --> 06:19:26.440 align:start position:0%
owner has indic indicated that they
 
06:19:28.310 --> 06:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
still intend to drop the Harvest to half
 
06:19:30.230 --> 06:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
the volume of previous years in favor of
 
06:19:31.390 --> 06:19:31.400 align:start position:0%
carbon credit
 
06:19:34.750 --> 06:19:34.760 align:start position:0%
generation we the state has not yet uh
 
06:19:37.270 --> 06:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
approved uh that plan relative to the
 
06:19:38.910 --> 06:19:38.920 align:start position:0%
purposes of the
 
06:19:42.788 --> 06:19:42.798 align:start position:0%
easement so that's still in the process
 
06:19:44.548 --> 06:19:44.558 align:start position:0%
we have multiple agencies looking at
 
06:19:46.628 --> 06:19:46.638 align:start position:0%
that uh we we did just receive their
 
06:19:48.350 --> 06:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
Forest management plan a couple weeks
 
06:19:51.430 --> 06:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
ago and so we'll be reviewing that and
 
06:19:53.310 --> 06:19:53.320 align:start position:0%
communicating back to the land owner
 
06:19:56.350 --> 06:19:56.360 align:start position:0%
regarding our our observations of that
 
06:19:58.830 --> 06:19:58.840 align:start position:0%
um new plan so at this stage as I
 
06:20:00.390 --> 06:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned it's still too early to
 
06:20:02.390 --> 06:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
determine how many land owners Statewide
 
06:20:04.628 --> 06:20:04.638 align:start position:0%
will enroll in such a program and how
 
06:20:07.310 --> 06:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
much this will affect uh Municipal tax
 
06:20:10.230 --> 06:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
revenues Timber tax leving here's some
 
06:20:13.110 --> 06:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
of the concerns leving a new tax on
 
06:20:14.670 --> 06:20:14.680 align:start position:0%
Forest land owners could lead to
 
06:20:16.670 --> 06:20:16.680 align:start position:0%
unintended outcomes such as conversion
 
06:20:18.468 --> 06:20:18.478 align:start position:0%
to other uses that may be deemed less
 
06:20:21.390 --> 06:20:21.400 align:start position:0%
beneficial to the public again I know
 
06:20:23.070 --> 06:20:23.080 align:start position:0%
it's New Hampshire the Live Free or Die
 
06:20:25.030 --> 06:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
State and uh you know taxes are looked
 
06:20:26.628 --> 06:20:26.638 align:start position:0%
at very seriously in this state so this
 
06:20:29.750 --> 06:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
would be a new this would be viewed as
 
06:20:31.548 --> 06:20:31.558 align:start position:0%
potentially a new tax on Forest land
 
06:20:34.430 --> 06:20:34.440 align:start position:0%
owners specifically and and that we
 
06:20:36.910 --> 06:20:36.920 align:start position:0%
concern may be viewed as one more one
 
06:20:38.990 --> 06:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
more um you know Death By A Thousand
 
06:20:41.190 --> 06:20:41.200 align:start position:0%
Cuts to own Timberland in New Hampshire
 
06:20:42.910 --> 06:20:42.920 align:start position:0%
again somewhat of an extreme view but we
 
06:20:44.468 --> 06:20:44.478 align:start position:0%
do have to look at that as a potential
 
06:20:47.070 --> 06:20:47.080 align:start position:0%
discouragement to Forest land
 
06:20:50.350 --> 06:20:50.360 align:start position:0%
ownership moderate land use tax policy
 
06:20:51.750 --> 06:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
has been the foundation of New
 
06:20:54.548 --> 06:20:54.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's conservation community and
 
06:20:56.468 --> 06:20:56.478 align:start position:0%
Alternate Revenue sources encourages
 
06:20:58.548 --> 06:20:58.558 align:start position:0%
land owners to keep their forests as
 
06:21:00.990 --> 06:21:01.000 align:start position:0%
forests if we really want to talk about
 
06:21:02.868 --> 06:21:02.878 align:start position:0%
an effect on the carbon equation and the
 
06:21:06.070 --> 06:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
environment is keeping Forest land in
 
06:21:08.190 --> 06:21:08.200 align:start position:0%
Forest ultimately that's the engine
 
06:21:11.670 --> 06:21:11.680 align:start position:0%
which converts CO2 to oxygen and helps
 
06:21:15.310 --> 06:21:15.320 align:start position:0%
us lower the um the greenhouse gas
 
06:21:18.270 --> 06:21:18.280 align:start position:0%
effect so that's really what what it's a
 
06:21:20.510 --> 06:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
broad concern but it's a real concern
 
06:21:23.270 --> 06:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
Forest loss is one of the the most uh
 
06:21:24.750 --> 06:21:24.760 align:start position:0%
one of the largest issues we've
 
06:21:27.430 --> 06:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
identified in our fa State Forest action
 
06:21:30.628 --> 06:21:30.638 align:start position:0%
plan any new tax formula proposed for
 
06:21:32.468 --> 06:21:32.478 align:start position:0%
carbon credits to offset the potential
 
06:21:35.030 --> 06:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
loss of Municipal Timber tax revenue
 
06:21:37.590 --> 06:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
must be proportional to the loss and
 
06:21:39.708 --> 06:21:39.718 align:start position:0%
carefully conceived without discouraging
 
06:21:41.830 --> 06:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
enrollment in such programs or
 
06:21:43.430 --> 06:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
discouragement of forest land ownership
 
06:21:43.440 --> 06:21:44.190 align:start position:0%
discouragement of forest land ownership
in

06:21:44.190 --> 06:21:44.200 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:21:47.230 --> 06:21:47.240 align:start position:0%
general the formula proposed in HB 1709
 
06:21:48.868 --> 06:21:48.878 align:start position:0%
to quantify and assess the value of
 
06:21:51.788 --> 06:21:51.798 align:start position:0%
carbon credits applies undefined metrics
 
06:21:53.548 --> 06:21:53.558 align:start position:0%
and terms that make it impossible to
 
06:21:55.708 --> 06:21:55.718 align:start position:0%
really understand it I and I respect the
 
06:21:57.190 --> 06:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
fact that Aman Kelly representative
 
06:21:59.830 --> 06:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
Kelly did a great job of of giving you
 
06:22:02.350 --> 06:22:02.360 align:start position:0%
some insight onto the mechanics of how
 
06:22:04.910 --> 06:22:04.920 align:start position:0%
he proposes that but there's still as he
 
06:22:06.350 --> 06:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned and we would agree there's a
 
06:22:08.110 --> 06:22:08.120 align:start position:0%
lot of work to do to understand the
 
06:22:10.510 --> 06:22:10.520 align:start position:0%
terms that he used and how we would get
 
06:22:12.468 --> 06:22:12.478 align:start position:0%
to that point if in fact there's
 
06:22:14.150 --> 06:22:14.160 align:start position:0%
consensus we should go
 
06:22:16.150 --> 06:22:16.160 align:start position:0%
there so I would say that more work
 
06:22:17.590 --> 06:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
would need to be done in this form for
 
06:22:19.230 --> 06:22:19.240 align:start position:0%
it to be practically
 
06:22:21.670 --> 06:22:21.680 align:start position:0%
implemented and those are my concerns
 
06:22:23.390 --> 06:22:23.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to testify
 
06:22:25.708 --> 06:22:25.718 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions any any
 
06:22:27.830 --> 06:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
questions for the speaker representative
 
06:22:30.788 --> 06:22:30.798 align:start position:0%
rung then representative wil thank you
 
06:22:33.708 --> 06:22:33.718 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you Mr Hackley for uh
 
06:22:35.868 --> 06:22:35.878 align:start position:0%
taking my question I actually have a
 
06:22:39.548 --> 06:22:39.558 align:start position:0%
couple one um how much money are we
 
06:22:41.750 --> 06:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
talking about so let's say somebody owns
 
06:22:44.548 --> 06:22:44.558 align:start position:0%
a forest it's it's on their land
 
06:22:47.190 --> 06:22:47.200 align:start position:0%
privately owned um how much money would
 
06:22:50.430 --> 06:22:50.440 align:start position:0%
they get from selling a carbon credit
 
06:22:53.510 --> 06:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
versus if they sold that you know the
 
06:22:57.910 --> 06:22:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:00.270 --> 06:23:00.280 align:start position:0%
the answer is it depends
 
06:23:02.430 --> 06:23:02.440 align:start position:0%
unfortunately um and I and I don't
 
06:23:05.030 --> 06:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
pretend to understand the the value of a
 
06:23:08.708 --> 06:23:08.718 align:start position:0%
carbon credit um which is one metric ton
 
06:23:11.830 --> 06:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
of carbon and it's there's a formula for
 
06:23:14.750 --> 06:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
um measuring that but that's a that's a
 
06:23:17.510 --> 06:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
market price question between the enrol
 
06:23:19.510 --> 06:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
of the program and the carbon Market
 
06:23:23.468 --> 06:23:23.478 align:start position:0%
that they've signed up with um but
 
06:23:24.990 --> 06:23:25.000 align:start position:0%
clearly there are companies such as the
 
06:23:27.548 --> 06:23:27.558 align:start position:0%
one in p Pittsburg that recently entered
 
06:23:31.830 --> 06:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
um entered into New Hampshire in
 
06:23:35.468 --> 06:23:35.478 align:start position:0%
2022 um where they're balancing the the
 
06:23:37.190 --> 06:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity to harvest Timber with the
 
06:23:39.628 --> 06:23:39.638 align:start position:0%
opportunity to generate carbon credits
 
06:23:42.910 --> 06:23:42.920 align:start position:0%
and as they see it and I I'm not I don't
 
06:23:45.430 --> 06:23:45.440 align:start position:0%
try to explain their business model but
 
06:23:48.270 --> 06:23:48.280 align:start position:0%
they see an opportunity to to to make a
 
06:23:51.070 --> 06:23:51.080 align:start position:0%
better margin off of carbon credits than
 
06:23:52.750 --> 06:23:52.760 align:start position:0%
than harvesting and selling Timber
 
06:23:55.190 --> 06:23:55.200 align:start position:0%
there's there's obviously some margin
 
06:23:57.750 --> 06:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
there that's more appealing and probably
 
06:23:59.468 --> 06:23:59.478 align:start position:0%
less complicated you don't have to do
 
06:24:00.948 --> 06:24:00.958 align:start position:0%
logging contracts you don't have to deal
 
06:24:01.948 --> 06:24:01.958 align:start position:0%
with loggers you don't have to worry
 
06:24:04.230 --> 06:24:04.240 align:start position:0%
about environmental impacts of Timber
 
06:24:06.070 --> 06:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
harvesting it's all just letting the
 
06:24:07.750 --> 06:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
trees grow I mean there's more to it
 
06:24:09.430 --> 06:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
than that there's modeling there's
 
06:24:11.830 --> 06:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
monitoring but it is much there's less
 
06:24:13.708 --> 06:24:13.718 align:start position:0%
moving parts to I would say growing a
 
06:24:16.670 --> 06:24:16.680 align:start position:0%
carbon credit than growing timber that's
 
06:24:19.510 --> 06:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
just my observation externally um so I
 
06:24:20.868 --> 06:24:20.878 align:start position:0%
can't answer your question directly
 
06:24:22.548 --> 06:24:22.558 align:start position:0%
represent wrong it's a good question
 
06:24:25.670 --> 06:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
though and it's obviously a favor able
 
06:24:27.670 --> 06:24:27.680 align:start position:0%
one a favorable equation when you can
 
06:24:30.310 --> 06:24:30.320 align:start position:0%
buy a large large tracks of land which
 
06:24:32.628 --> 06:24:32.638 align:start position:0%
companies are now doing and focusing on
 
06:24:34.750 --> 06:24:34.760 align:start position:0%
the generation of carbon credits that
 
06:24:36.150 --> 06:24:36.160 align:start position:0%
there's obviously something there that's
 
06:24:38.628 --> 06:24:38.638 align:start position:0%
appealing one more question has has the
 
06:24:40.948 --> 06:24:40.958 align:start position:0%
state considered selling carbon credits
 
06:24:44.788 --> 06:24:44.798 align:start position:0%
on land they own we the question has
 
06:24:47.270 --> 06:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
come up there are states in in the US
 
06:24:49.430 --> 06:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
that are doing it Michigan in particular
 
06:24:51.190 --> 06:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
very entrepreneurial with their forests
 
06:24:53.468 --> 06:24:53.478 align:start position:0%
they're they're they're generating solar
 
06:24:55.868 --> 06:24:55.878 align:start position:0%
energy they're selling carbon credits
 
06:24:58.030 --> 06:24:58.040 align:start position:0%
um uh they're doing a lot of different
 
06:24:59.670 --> 06:24:59.680 align:start position:0%
things and other states are I believe
 
06:25:02.910 --> 06:25:02.920 align:start position:0%
considering it um we are not we are not
 
06:25:06.150 --> 06:25:06.160 align:start position:0%
currently considering it yeah
 
06:25:06.160 --> 06:25:07.390 align:start position:0%
currently considering it yeah
representative

06:25:07.390 --> 06:25:07.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:25:10.670 --> 06:25:10.680 align:start position:0%
will thank you for taking my question
 
06:25:14.230 --> 06:25:14.240 align:start position:0%
director um I guess
 
06:25:16.670 --> 06:25:16.680 align:start position:0%
I wish I had the opportunity
 
06:25:18.590 --> 06:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly
 
06:25:22.468 --> 06:25:22.478 align:start position:0%
to understand a little bit more on the
 
06:25:25.270 --> 06:25:25.280 align:start position:0%
uh fees that are coming but in regard to
 
06:25:27.990 --> 06:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
to something that I think you can answer
 
06:25:31.230 --> 06:25:31.240 align:start position:0%
if we start harvesting
 
06:25:33.708 --> 06:25:33.718 align:start position:0%
Timber what effect is that're going to
 
06:25:34.830 --> 06:25:34.840 align:start position:0%
have in the
 
06:25:38.310 --> 06:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
socioeconomic life of the North Country
 
06:25:40.788 --> 06:25:40.798 align:start position:0%
right it's a good question thank you for
 
06:25:42.430 --> 06:25:42.440 align:start position:0%
that I
 
06:25:45.788 --> 06:25:45.798 align:start position:0%
think it's a it's an important question
 
06:25:49.590 --> 06:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
um so we're we're charting new territory
 
06:25:52.230 --> 06:25:52.240 align:start position:0%
here representative wolf I mean this
 
06:25:54.830 --> 06:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
this is um a circumstance that I don't
 
06:25:57.468 --> 06:25:57.478 align:start position:0%
think any one predicted 20 years ago
 
06:25:59.070 --> 06:25:59.080 align:start position:0%
certainly they did not when they crafted
 
06:26:01.350 --> 06:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
the conservation easement and that's the
 
06:26:04.190 --> 06:26:04.200 align:start position:0%
variable here um the particular owner in
 
06:26:07.190 --> 06:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
the North Country um owns land in other
 
06:26:09.468 --> 06:26:09.478 align:start position:0%
states that aren't where the land is not
 
06:26:11.070 --> 06:26:11.080 align:start position:0%
necessarily encumbered by an easement
 
06:26:12.468 --> 06:26:12.478 align:start position:0%
where there's there's not this
 
06:26:15.670 --> 06:26:15.680 align:start position:0%
requirement for sustainable forestry and
 
06:26:18.030 --> 06:26:18.040 align:start position:0%
um harvesting of wood products which is
 
06:26:22.868 --> 06:26:22.878 align:start position:0%
language in the easement so um to and
 
06:26:24.708 --> 06:26:24.718 align:start position:0%
just for the record for those of you who
 
06:26:26.548 --> 06:26:26.558 align:start position:0%
studied this I'm sure representative
 
06:26:28.788 --> 06:26:28.798 align:start position:0%
Kelly has the previous landowner
 
06:26:30.310 --> 06:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
enrolled this program it's not the
 
06:26:31.510 --> 06:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
current land owner that enrolled in a
 
06:26:33.350 --> 06:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
carbon credit program the previous owner
 
06:26:35.030 --> 06:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
the investment entity called the force
 
06:26:38.230 --> 06:26:38.240 align:start position:0%
Land Group um they enrolled the program
 
06:26:40.868 --> 06:26:40.878 align:start position:0%
the property in the program between 2013
 
06:26:44.070 --> 06:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
and 2014 so almost for 10 years this
 
06:26:48.390 --> 06:26:48.400 align:start position:0%
property has sold credits to some level
 
06:26:51.310 --> 06:26:51.320 align:start position:0%
to some degree and harvested Timber so
 
06:26:52.910 --> 06:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
that's another Point another takeaway
 
06:26:54.910 --> 06:26:54.920 align:start position:0%
for the committee you can do both on the
 
06:26:57.270 --> 06:26:57.280 align:start position:0%
same same property they can these two
 
06:26:59.590 --> 06:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
values can coexist and
 
06:27:02.628 --> 06:27:02.638 align:start position:0%
do um and the current landown has not
 
06:27:04.110 --> 06:27:04.120 align:start position:0%
said they're not going to cut anywh
 
06:27:05.830 --> 06:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
they're just going to they're going to
 
06:27:08.590 --> 06:27:08.600 align:start position:0%
focus more on generating carbon credits
 
06:27:11.830 --> 06:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
than than generating Timber so to get to
 
06:27:13.948 --> 06:27:13.958 align:start position:0%
the to the point of your
 
06:27:16.070 --> 06:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
question from the stakeholders we've
 
06:27:20.628 --> 06:27:20.638 align:start position:0%
heard from this will have a a fairly
 
06:27:23.990 --> 06:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
significant impact on certain values
 
06:27:26.548 --> 06:27:26.558 align:start position:0%
that come from a more robust Timber
 
06:27:29.788 --> 06:27:29.798 align:start position:0%
program um so and and those of you who
 
06:27:32.350 --> 06:27:32.360 align:start position:0%
have read the articles there's a
 
06:27:34.468 --> 06:27:34.478 align:start position:0%
substantial big enough hit to the town
 
06:27:37.390 --> 06:27:37.400 align:start position:0%
of Pittsburgh where they've really come
 
06:27:38.430 --> 06:27:38.440 align:start position:0%
to the four and they've come to the
 
06:27:39.788 --> 06:27:39.798 align:start position:0%
citizens committee meetings and they're
 
06:27:41.910 --> 06:27:41.920 align:start position:0%
concerned about how to replace the Lost
 
06:27:44.830 --> 06:27:44.840 align:start position:0%
Timber tax revenue from this land that
 
06:27:49.070 --> 06:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
has on average produced roughly 27 to
 
06:27:53.868 --> 06:27:53.878 align:start position:0%
29,000 cords per year down to uh
 
06:27:57.750 --> 06:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
proposed 12 to 14 so it's it is
 
06:27:59.750 --> 06:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
literally half of what was traditionally
 
06:28:01.990 --> 06:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
harvested from no one knew the wiser
 
06:28:03.430 --> 06:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
when the previous land owner was
 
06:28:04.990 --> 06:28:05.000 align:start position:0%
generating carbon and cutting wood they
 
06:28:07.468 --> 06:28:07.478 align:start position:0%
were kind of balancing both the new
 
06:28:09.788 --> 06:28:09.798 align:start position:0%
owner has a different business model
 
06:28:12.190 --> 06:28:12.200 align:start position:0%
that's certainly their prerogative but
 
06:28:13.670 --> 06:28:13.680 align:start position:0%
there are other values now being
 
06:28:17.510 --> 06:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
impacted by the scale of this new plan
 
06:28:20.788 --> 06:28:20.798 align:start position:0%
and that's that's why the state's really
 
06:28:22.430 --> 06:28:22.440 align:start position:0%
looking at the easen and talking with
 
06:28:23.830 --> 06:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
the land owner and trying to come up
 
06:28:27.190 --> 06:28:27.200 align:start position:0%
with how we can still meet the social
 
06:28:30.390 --> 06:28:30.400 align:start position:0%
economic needs of the the North country
 
06:28:33.390 --> 06:28:33.400 align:start position:0%
and respect the property rights of of
 
06:28:37.310 --> 06:28:37.320 align:start position:0%
the new owner there in Pittsburgh
 
06:28:40.948 --> 06:28:40.958 align:start position:0%
so representative Derby thank you Mr
 
06:28:43.510 --> 06:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
06:28:45.110 --> 06:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
um so first
 
06:28:47.948 --> 06:28:47.958 align:start position:0%
I um I agree that there's a number of
 
06:28:49.110 --> 06:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
terms in here that don't seem to be
 
06:28:52.310 --> 06:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
defined and um probably uh
 
06:28:55.270 --> 06:28:55.280 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly wants to add some
 
06:28:57.910 --> 06:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
clarity there and get some feedback but
 
06:29:01.750 --> 06:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
my real question is um regarding your
 
06:29:06.030 --> 06:29:06.040 align:start position:0%
concern about um conversion from you
 
06:29:08.788 --> 06:29:08.798 align:start position:0%
know uh Forest land to non-forest
 
06:29:13.670 --> 06:29:13.680 align:start position:0%
land you know 79 RSA 795 says that if
 
06:29:15.750 --> 06:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
you don't use the land if you don't cut
 
06:29:18.670 --> 06:29:18.680 align:start position:0%
the cut the wood you can get taxed on it
 
06:29:23.468 --> 06:29:23.478 align:start position:0%
anyway this bill seems to say that um
 
06:29:26.310 --> 06:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
the tax is only going to be be assessed
 
06:29:30.510 --> 06:29:30.520 align:start position:0%
on EST on um estimated stumpage above
 
06:29:32.430 --> 06:29:32.440 align:start position:0%
Baseline of course that's one of the
 
06:29:33.590 --> 06:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
terms that I don't think it's defined
 
06:29:36.788 --> 06:29:36.798 align:start position:0%
well yeah but to me what it means is you
 
06:29:38.948 --> 06:29:38.958 align:start position:0%
got a you got trees on on the property
 
06:29:41.350 --> 06:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
now you've got this um this greenhouse
 
06:29:43.868 --> 06:29:43.878 align:start position:0%
gas plant or whatnot and where are you
 
06:29:45.830 --> 06:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
gonna be at some point in the future and
 
06:29:48.670 --> 06:29:48.680 align:start position:0%
so it's only the the above and beyond
 
06:29:51.110 --> 06:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
where you are so if you keep it where it
 
06:29:53.708 --> 06:29:53.718 align:start position:0%
is it seems to me there's no tax except
 
06:29:55.628 --> 06:29:55.638 align:start position:0%
for potentially that the fact that
 
06:29:57.110 --> 06:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
you're not cutting the wood in the first
 
06:30:00.830 --> 06:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
place which is which is already the the
 
06:30:03.510 --> 06:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
threat of of Taxation there yeah so I
 
06:30:06.868 --> 06:30:06.878 align:start position:0%
wonder if you read my question to you is
 
06:30:09.910 --> 06:30:09.920 align:start position:0%
if you read it similarly which is that
 
06:30:12.390 --> 06:30:12.400 align:start position:0%
if they maintain the Baseline then
 
06:30:15.030 --> 06:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
there's really no difference um and it
 
06:30:18.510 --> 06:30:18.520 align:start position:0%
would reduce the threat of um people
 
06:30:20.628 --> 06:30:20.638 align:start position:0%
deciding to cut down their Force because
 
06:30:23.868 --> 06:30:23.878 align:start position:0%
of an additional tax yeah thank you for
 
06:30:25.390 --> 06:30:25.400 align:start position:0%
that question
 
06:30:28.110 --> 06:30:28.120 align:start position:0%
you know I'll just I'll just say I don't
 
06:30:29.868 --> 06:30:29.878 align:start position:0%
understand the terms in the in the the
 
06:30:32.190 --> 06:30:32.200 align:start position:0%
legislation but but the way you framed
 
06:30:34.788 --> 06:30:34.798 align:start position:0%
it that could be the case it again the
 
06:30:36.190 --> 06:30:36.200 align:start position:0%
devil's in the details and the
 
06:30:39.030 --> 06:30:39.040 align:start position:0%
definitions of how we get to the the
 
06:30:43.590 --> 06:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
point of of taxing a carving credit um
 
06:30:45.150 --> 06:30:45.160 align:start position:0%
I'm just I'm talking about the
 
06:30:47.150 --> 06:30:47.160 align:start position:0%
perception of like you know he's a land
 
06:30:48.990 --> 06:30:49.000 align:start position:0%
owner looking to well I'm going to still
 
06:30:50.388 --> 06:30:50.398 align:start position:0%
going to cut some wood but hey I've got
 
06:30:52.030 --> 06:30:52.040 align:start position:0%
500 Acres maybe I'd like to put a 100 in
 
06:30:53.990 --> 06:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
the carbon credit program hey and I
 
06:30:55.548 --> 06:30:55.558 align:start position:0%
don't have to pay Timber tax I'll just
 
06:30:57.468 --> 06:30:57.478 align:start position:0%
generate some well you're going to maybe
 
06:30:59.670 --> 06:30:59.680 align:start position:0%
you will be paying carbon
 
06:31:02.230 --> 06:31:02.240 align:start position:0%
taxes not necessarily I you know there's
 
06:31:05.110 --> 06:31:05.120 align:start position:0%
a threat of Merit to this idea because
 
06:31:07.190 --> 06:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
we we don't want to see lost Municipal
 
06:31:09.070 --> 06:31:09.080 align:start position:0%
tax revenue Which towns have come to
 
06:31:11.510 --> 06:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
rely on through the timber tax program
 
06:31:13.670 --> 06:31:13.680 align:start position:0%
so you know I think it's going to be an
 
06:31:15.190 --> 06:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
evolving discussion as representative
 
06:31:19.030 --> 06:31:19.040 align:start position:0%
Kelly already alluded to how how to get
 
06:31:21.388 --> 06:31:21.398 align:start position:0%
there if if that is in fact a consensus
 
06:31:24.190 --> 06:31:24.200 align:start position:0%
of what people want and so thank you for
 
06:31:27.270 --> 06:31:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:29.548 --> 06:31:29.558 align:start position:0%
any other questions before we go back to
 
06:31:33.150 --> 06:31:33.160 align:start position:0%
Mr Wolf representative wolf just to
 
06:31:35.510 --> 06:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
follow up on my question we're all
 
06:31:37.750 --> 06:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
talking about Timber tax for the
 
06:31:40.510 --> 06:31:40.520 align:start position:0%
municipality yeah but nobody's talking
 
06:31:42.590 --> 06:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
about the guy
 
06:31:45.310 --> 06:31:45.320 align:start position:0%
that's going down to Ed Nash's place and
 
06:31:47.670 --> 06:31:47.680 align:start position:0%
buying a you skitter or something like
 
06:31:49.868 --> 06:31:49.878 align:start position:0%
that and where is that Revenue going to
 
06:31:52.468 --> 06:31:52.478 align:start position:0%
come from and the ability to earn a
 
06:31:54.788 --> 06:31:54.798 align:start position:0%
living up there yeah if they're just
 
06:31:57.590 --> 06:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
sitting there watching trees grow yeah
 
06:32:01.430 --> 06:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you represent wolf um yeah so
 
06:32:04.310 --> 06:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
there's a chain reaction to A reduced
 
06:32:07.070 --> 06:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
harvesting on on Forest land in general
 
06:32:09.070 --> 06:32:09.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to just speak to the
 
06:32:10.230 --> 06:32:10.240 align:start position:0%
Pittsburgh issue because I think we've
 
06:32:13.110 --> 06:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
touched on that enough but let's just
 
06:32:14.868 --> 06:32:14.878 align:start position:0%
say everyone jumped in on the party and
 
06:32:17.110 --> 06:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
started selling carbon credits and that
 
06:32:19.110 --> 06:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
is a real concern for some of the wood
 
06:32:21.150 --> 06:32:21.160 align:start position:0%
processing facilities in New Hampshire
 
06:32:24.270 --> 06:32:24.280 align:start position:0%
at the hearing yesterday there as you
 
06:32:26.230 --> 06:32:26.240 align:start position:0%
some of you may know there were a few
 
06:32:29.070 --> 06:32:29.080 align:start position:0%
Mills from the North Country who are
 
06:32:31.788 --> 06:32:31.798 align:start position:0%
dealing with a lot of other issues that
 
06:32:34.230 --> 06:32:34.240 align:start position:0%
uh affect their bottom line trucking
 
06:32:36.310 --> 06:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
fuel costs
 
06:32:38.990 --> 06:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
Labor uh wood markets not enough
 
06:32:40.750 --> 06:32:40.760 align:start position:0%
low-grade wood markets we've those of
 
06:32:42.070 --> 06:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
you who follow these issues in the
 
06:32:43.788 --> 06:32:43.798 align:start position:0%
forest products industry know those and
 
06:32:45.750 --> 06:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
that and so now they're saying oh now
 
06:32:48.388 --> 06:32:48.398 align:start position:0%
our wood supply might be diminished
 
06:32:50.190 --> 06:32:50.200 align:start position:0%
because there's this carbon credit thing
 
06:32:53.310 --> 06:32:53.320 align:start position:0%
and everyone's running around trying to
 
06:32:55.110 --> 06:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
get definitions of what a carb credit
 
06:32:57.150 --> 06:32:57.160 align:start position:0%
program is but they see it as one more
 
06:32:59.388 --> 06:32:59.398 align:start position:0%
hit to making a living in the
 
06:32:59.398 --> 06:33:01.110 align:start position:0%
hit to making a living in the
forest

06:33:01.110 --> 06:33:01.120 align:start position:0%
forest
 
06:33:04.990 --> 06:33:05.000 align:start position:0%
so exactly right there's it's not just
 
06:33:07.948 --> 06:33:07.958 align:start position:0%
um it's not just cutting wood it's
 
06:33:10.830 --> 06:33:10.840 align:start position:0%
you're you're producing wood products
 
06:33:12.590 --> 06:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
that provide a job to the logger that
 
06:33:14.590 --> 06:33:14.600 align:start position:0%
cuts the wood to the trucker that
 
06:33:17.110 --> 06:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
deliver delivers it to the mill The
 
06:33:19.468 --> 06:33:19.478 align:start position:0%
Sawmill that makes products out of it
 
06:33:22.310 --> 06:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
and employs their people and so we call
 
06:33:25.388 --> 06:33:25.398 align:start position:0%
that the wood supply chain and the wood
 
06:33:26.868 --> 06:33:26.878 align:start position:0%
supp supply chain is one of the
 
06:33:29.750 --> 06:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
stakeholders in this concept of carbon
 
06:33:32.750 --> 06:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
credits that we have to be mindful
 
06:33:35.990 --> 06:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
of any other
 
06:33:40.830 --> 06:33:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:44.190 --> 06:33:44.200 align:start position:0%
testimony next in opposition Blake

06:33:53.468 --> 06:33:53.478 align:start position:0%

06:34:10.708 --> 06:34:10.718 align:start position:0%
is it on okay there we go sorry about
 
06:34:14.708 --> 06:34:14.718 align:start position:0%
that um my name is Blake stansil and I'm
 
06:34:17.388 --> 06:34:17.398 align:start position:0%
the president of Aurora sustainable
 
06:34:20.190 --> 06:34:20.200 align:start position:0%
lands I think we're the we're the
 
06:34:23.190 --> 06:34:23.200 align:start position:0%
company with the Target on our back uh
 
06:34:26.230 --> 06:34:26.240 align:start position:0%
that a lot of the carbon bills have been
 
06:34:28.150 --> 06:34:28.160 align:start position:0%
uh drafted for I think at least
 
06:34:29.990 --> 06:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
originally so I hope to be able to
 
06:34:31.708 --> 06:34:31.718 align:start position:0%
explain a little bit about who we are
 
06:34:36.030 --> 06:34:36.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:40.110 --> 06:34:40.120 align:start position:0%
um and and uh just comments on the bill
 
06:34:44.310 --> 06:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
itself um well before I say that the uh
 
06:34:48.468 --> 06:34:48.478 align:start position:0%
the company owns 1.65 million acres and
 
06:34:51.548 --> 06:34:51.558 align:start position:0%
the Connecticut Lakes property here that
 
06:34:54.510 --> 06:34:54.520 align:start position:0%
we manage is 146,000 so that's a
 
06:34:56.750 --> 06:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
component of our of our
 
06:35:00.750 --> 06:35:00.760 align:start position:0%
portfolio uh we became the owner of that
 
06:35:04.350 --> 06:35:04.360 align:start position:0%
property in late 2022 through a merger
 
06:35:06.948 --> 06:35:06.958 align:start position:0%
with the forest Land Group uh Patrick
 
06:35:09.590 --> 06:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned Forest Land Group before I was
 
06:35:12.350 --> 06:35:12.360 align:start position:0%
with the forest Land Group and have some
 
06:35:14.868 --> 06:35:14.878 align:start position:0%
history with the property so I I uh been
 
06:35:17.230 --> 06:35:17.240 align:start position:0%
around for a good bit of of time on the
 
06:35:20.788 --> 06:35:20.798 align:start position:0%
property itself and we're we're opposed
 
06:35:24.548 --> 06:35:24.558 align:start position:0%
to this bill um and I'll give a a few
 
06:35:27.708 --> 06:35:27.718 align:start position:0%
reasons for it uh the first one is mean
 
06:35:30.110 --> 06:35:30.120 align:start position:0%
we we pay New Hampshire business tax we
 
06:35:33.270 --> 06:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
pay property tax we pay Severance tax we
 
06:35:35.270 --> 06:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
pay Road use
 
06:35:39.430 --> 06:35:39.440 align:start position:0%
fees and um out of our
 
06:35:42.990 --> 06:35:43.000 align:start position:0%
1.65 million acre portfolio I believe
 
06:35:45.948 --> 06:35:45.958 align:start position:0%
this property is likely the most
 
06:35:51.788 --> 06:35:51.798 align:start position:0%
regulated in our portfolio um and it's
 
06:35:56.110 --> 06:35:56.120 align:start position:0%
also worth noting that I believe a tax
 
06:35:58.030 --> 06:35:58.040 align:start position:0%
of the kind we're we're talking about
 
06:36:00.708 --> 06:36:00.718 align:start position:0%
here would be the first of its kind in
 
06:36:01.830 --> 06:36:01.840 align:start position:0%
the country I don't think there's
 
06:36:06.430 --> 06:36:06.440 align:start position:0%
another tax like this out there um who
 
06:36:06.440 --> 06:36:07.310 align:start position:0%
another tax like this out there um who
is

06:36:07.310 --> 06:36:07.320 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:36:10.030 --> 06:36:10.040 align:start position:0%
Aurora uh we're we're a company that
 
06:36:13.628 --> 06:36:13.638 align:start position:0%
focuses on buying and managing Forest
 
06:36:16.388 --> 06:36:16.398 align:start position:0%
land in the US to remove and store
 
06:36:20.628 --> 06:36:20.638 align:start position:0%
carbon from the atmosphere um we be and
 
06:36:22.788 --> 06:36:22.798 align:start position:0%
and I mentioned how we became owners of
 
06:36:26.110 --> 06:36:26.120 align:start position:0%
this property um uh but the thing the
 
06:36:28.510 --> 06:36:28.520 align:start position:0%
the thing I also want to make clear here
 
06:36:32.948 --> 06:36:32.958 align:start position:0%
today is we absolutely plan to continue
 
06:36:35.788 --> 06:36:35.798 align:start position:0%
logging so we're we're focused on
 
06:36:38.910 --> 06:36:38.920 align:start position:0%
generating carbon credits but recognize
 
06:36:41.430 --> 06:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
that the way you generate carbon credits
 
06:36:44.830 --> 06:36:44.840 align:start position:0%
is through a healthy Forest so a healthy
 
06:36:47.110 --> 06:36:47.120 align:start position:0%
Forest is a managed Forest a managed
 
06:36:49.670 --> 06:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
Forest means logging is occurring so I
 
06:36:53.670 --> 06:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
want to just make sure that's clear um
 
06:36:55.910 --> 06:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
just a few few facts about the property
 
06:36:58.510 --> 06:36:58.520 align:start position:0%
itself uh the the Connecticut Lakes
 
06:37:01.350 --> 06:37:01.360 align:start position:0%
property is the the largest privately
 
06:37:04.110 --> 06:37:04.120 align:start position:0%
owned uh forest in the state that's open
 
06:37:08.030 --> 06:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
to the public uh it's been managed under
 
06:37:10.510 --> 06:37:10.520 align:start position:0%
this existing conservation easement
 
06:37:10.520 --> 06:37:11.910 align:start position:0%
this existing conservation easement
since

06:37:11.910 --> 06:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
since
 
06:37:15.750 --> 06:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
2003 and as Patrick mentioned before
 
06:37:18.948 --> 06:37:18.958 align:start position:0%
it's uh also been enrolled in a carbon
 
06:37:21.788 --> 06:37:21.798 align:start position:0%
project since 2013 so the the Project's
 
06:37:23.190 --> 06:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
been around for a
 
06:37:23.200 --> 06:37:25.990 align:start position:0%
been around for a
while

06:37:25.990 --> 06:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
while
 
06:37:29.230 --> 06:37:29.240 align:start position:0%
um in terms of our management and the
 
06:37:30.750 --> 06:37:30.760 align:start position:0%
things that we plan to do on the
 
06:37:34.670 --> 06:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
property first off I would say that we
 
06:37:38.150 --> 06:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
will absolutely manage per the letter
 
06:37:39.750 --> 06:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
and the spirit of the conservation
 
06:37:43.230 --> 06:37:43.240 align:start position:0%
easement uh we're actively engaged in
 
06:37:46.990 --> 06:37:47.000 align:start position:0%
the process uh that's laid out of having
 
06:37:49.910 --> 06:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
an approved Forest management plan we're
 
06:37:52.868 --> 06:37:52.878 align:start position:0%
we're in active conversations with the
 
06:37:57.110 --> 06:37:57.120 align:start position:0%
division of forest and land and and um
 
06:38:00.468 --> 06:38:00.478 align:start position:0%
we also
 
06:38:03.590 --> 06:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
um perhaps most importantly to to folks
 
06:38:05.070 --> 06:38:05.080 align:start position:0%
in the North country as I mentioned
 
06:38:08.030 --> 06:38:08.040 align:start position:0%
before we also plan to continue logging
 
06:38:12.190 --> 06:38:12.200 align:start position:0%
and the the fact is um there's actually
 
06:38:13.948 --> 06:38:13.958 align:start position:0%
logging going on on the property right
 
06:38:16.510 --> 06:38:16.520 align:start position:0%
now actually maybe not today because of
 
06:38:18.548 --> 06:38:18.558 align:start position:0%
the weather conditions but as of a few
 
06:38:21.510 --> 06:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
days ago there were active uh crews out
 
06:38:24.388 --> 06:38:24.398 align:start position:0%
on the property and while the the
 
06:38:28.230 --> 06:38:28.240 align:start position:0%
overall volume of logging is going down
 
06:38:31.150 --> 06:38:31.160 align:start position:0%
that was also discussed previously the
 
06:38:33.628 --> 06:38:33.638 align:start position:0%
type of Forestry that we're practicing
 
06:38:38.070 --> 06:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
is more precise it's more detailed and
 
06:38:41.830 --> 06:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
will require uh a more labor intensive
 
06:38:44.910 --> 06:38:44.920 align:start position:0%
process on a Timber sale by Timber sale
 
06:38:48.350 --> 06:38:48.360 align:start position:0%
basis so we anticipate having more uh
 
06:38:52.430 --> 06:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
need for Foresters GIS Specialists land
 
06:38:54.910 --> 06:38:54.920 align:start position:0%
surveyors more Tech techncal kind of
 
06:38:58.270 --> 06:38:58.280 align:start position:0%
folks on the ground as we implement this
 
06:38:58.280 --> 06:38:59.190 align:start position:0%
folks on the ground as we implement this
new

06:38:59.190 --> 06:38:59.200 align:start position:0%
new
 
06:39:03.388 --> 06:39:03.398 align:start position:0%
strategy um and then also on the tax
 
06:39:07.030 --> 06:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
side there we recognize that reduced
 
06:39:09.628 --> 06:39:09.638 align:start position:0%
Timber volumes has an impact in the
 
06:39:12.510 --> 06:39:12.520 align:start position:0%
North Country especially uh the town of
 
06:39:14.910 --> 06:39:14.920 align:start position:0%
Pittsburgh where the majority of the
 
06:39:18.628 --> 06:39:18.638 align:start position:0%
Timber Severance tax is paid uh so we
 
06:39:21.670 --> 06:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
have reached an agreement in principle
 
06:39:26.230 --> 06:39:26.240 align:start position:0%
with the town whereby um Aurora
 
06:39:29.670 --> 06:39:29.680 align:start position:0%
will bridge the gap between what has
 
06:39:32.628 --> 06:39:32.638 align:start position:0%
been paid in Timber Severance tax
 
06:39:35.788 --> 06:39:35.798 align:start position:0%
revenue uh on average historically
 
06:39:38.230 --> 06:39:38.240 align:start position:0%
compared to what will be paid during the
 
06:39:40.468 --> 06:39:40.478 align:start position:0%
current fiscal year from this new
 
06:39:43.510 --> 06:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
harvesting plan so we're we're in active
 
06:39:46.230 --> 06:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
dialogue our Forester who's in charge of
 
06:39:48.548 --> 06:39:48.558 align:start position:0%
the property has been to the town
 
06:39:50.948 --> 06:39:50.958 align:start position:0%
meetings and uh has an active di
 
06:39:53.230 --> 06:39:53.240 align:start position:0%
dialogue with the the selectman of
 
06:39:53.240 --> 06:39:56.388 align:start position:0%
dialogue with the the selectman of
Pittsburgh

06:39:56.388 --> 06:39:56.398 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:00.510 --> 06:40:00.520 align:start position:0%
um in conclusion and and I'm happy to to
 
06:40:03.270 --> 06:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
talk more about things obviously but uh
 
06:40:05.670 --> 06:40:05.680 align:start position:0%
just want to say that we appreciate the
 
06:40:08.868 --> 06:40:08.878 align:start position:0%
conversations we've had with local state
 
06:40:10.310 --> 06:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
and federal
 
06:40:14.510 --> 06:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
officials uh and we we absolutely
 
06:40:17.868 --> 06:40:17.878 align:start position:0%
understand and respect uh our
 
06:40:19.868 --> 06:40:19.878 align:start position:0%
responsibility as stewards of this
 
06:40:22.350 --> 06:40:22.360 align:start position:0%
remarkable resource and we look forward
 
06:40:24.590 --> 06:40:24.600 align:start position:0%
to continue to collaborate with the
 
06:40:24.600 --> 06:40:25.628 align:start position:0%
to continue to collaborate with the
local

06:40:25.628 --> 06:40:25.638 align:start position:0%
local
 
06:40:29.030 --> 06:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
community uh with State Legislature and
 
06:40:32.430 --> 06:40:32.440 align:start position:0%
with public officials to make sure that
 
06:40:35.388 --> 06:40:35.398 align:start position:0%
the property is not only protected but
 
06:40:38.830 --> 06:40:38.840 align:start position:0%
also enhanced and the the continued use
 
06:40:42.868 --> 06:40:42.878 align:start position:0%
and enjoyment is there for residents and
 
06:40:49.708 --> 06:40:49.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:52.190 --> 06:40:52.200 align:start position:0%
Vale thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
06:40:55.670 --> 06:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
the testimony um I just am wondering
 
06:40:59.548 --> 06:40:59.558 align:start position:0%
what is the current price of a carbon
 
06:41:02.150 --> 06:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
credit it
 
06:41:05.388 --> 06:41:05.398 align:start position:0%
depends and not dodging the question but
 
06:41:08.628 --> 06:41:08.638 align:start position:0%
it really does uh it depends on whether
 
06:41:11.468 --> 06:41:11.478 align:start position:0%
the credit is sold in the compliance
 
06:41:14.270 --> 06:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
Market all things that were mentioned
 
06:41:15.510 --> 06:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
earlier whether it's sold in the
 
06:41:18.628 --> 06:41:18.638 align:start position:0%
compliance Market the voluntary Market
 
06:41:20.750 --> 06:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
uh whether it was generated from a
 
06:41:23.350 --> 06:41:23.360 align:start position:0%
property uh somewhere outside the US so
 
06:41:25.910 --> 06:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
there's a lot a lot of different issues
 
06:41:28.990 --> 06:41:29.000 align:start position:0%
around that question um and the the
 
06:41:34.350 --> 06:41:34.360 align:start position:0%
market itself has been in a bit of a
 
06:41:36.150 --> 06:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
transition uh in
 
06:41:39.830 --> 06:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
2023 as buyers of credits have taken a
 
06:41:43.350 --> 06:41:43.360 align:start position:0%
step back to say how do we ensure that
 
06:41:46.030 --> 06:41:46.040 align:start position:0%
this is an actual that that this credit
 
06:41:49.708 --> 06:41:49.718 align:start position:0%
I'm buying has an actual environmental
 
06:41:54.990 --> 06:41:55.000 align:start position:0%
impact so um it it's it's a difficult
 
06:41:58.230 --> 06:41:58.240 align:start position:0%
question to to put an actual number
 
06:42:00.910 --> 06:42:00.920 align:start position:0%
on thank you may I have a followup Mr
 
06:42:03.990 --> 06:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
chair thank you um my followup question
 
06:42:06.590 --> 06:42:06.600 align:start position:0%
is what is the duration of your credit
 
06:42:08.510 --> 06:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
um contact
 
06:42:12.230 --> 06:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
contracts so the uh the the property
 
06:42:13.990 --> 06:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
that we manage here that has that
 
06:42:16.150 --> 06:42:16.160 align:start position:0%
project on it that's been in place since
 
06:42:19.590 --> 06:42:19.600 align:start position:0%
2013 that is a um project that's
 
06:42:22.590 --> 06:42:22.600 align:start position:0%
registered in the compliance market and
 
06:42:26.788 --> 06:42:26.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:30.430 --> 06:42:30.440 align:start position:0%
years one more followup Mr chair thank
 
06:42:33.628 --> 06:42:33.638 align:start position:0%
you how many credits do you generate on
 
06:42:39.548 --> 06:42:39.558 align:start position:0%
an average um Forest over a hundred-year
 
06:42:39.558 --> 06:42:41.628 align:start position:0%
an average um Forest over a hundred-year
period

06:42:41.628 --> 06:42:41.638 align:start position:0%
period
 
06:42:44.388 --> 06:42:44.398 align:start position:0%
depends sorry for that answer but uh
 
06:42:46.070 --> 06:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
yeah it it
 
06:42:50.590 --> 06:42:50.600 align:start position:0%
um it depends on where the forest is so
 
06:42:52.910 --> 06:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
how long's the growing season depends on
 
06:42:56.070 --> 06:42:56.080 align:start position:0%
how it's managed Ed uh so a lot of
 
06:42:56.080 --> 06:42:57.350 align:start position:0%
how it's managed Ed uh so a lot of
factors

06:42:57.350 --> 06:42:57.360 align:start position:0%
factors
 
06:43:00.350 --> 06:43:00.360 align:start position:0%
involved thank you so much for taking my
 
06:43:03.708 --> 06:43:03.718 align:start position:0%
question anyone representative rang
 
06:43:05.030 --> 06:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
06:43:07.150 --> 06:43:07.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question I I actually have
 
06:43:11.910 --> 06:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
just two one is um you mentioned that um
 
06:43:14.110 --> 06:43:14.120 align:start position:0%
managing a force that's under carbon
 
06:43:16.388 --> 06:43:16.398 align:start position:0%
credit agreement requires some
 
06:43:19.788 --> 06:43:19.798 align:start position:0%
additional employees how does that like
 
06:43:23.150 --> 06:43:23.160 align:start position:0%
what's the net employee um addition or
 
06:43:23.160 --> 06:43:24.190 align:start position:0%
what's the net employee um addition or
loss

06:43:24.190 --> 06:43:24.200 align:start position:0%
loss
 
06:43:26.548 --> 06:43:26.558 align:start position:0%
with that let's say use that property in
 
06:43:30.190 --> 06:43:30.200 align:start position:0%
Pittsburgh compared to if it was just um
 
06:43:34.670 --> 06:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
in uh the timber industry I'll I'll
 
06:43:38.350 --> 06:43:38.360 align:start position:0%
clarify my comments there so uh my
 
06:43:41.310 --> 06:43:41.320 align:start position:0%
comments were specific to the type of of
 
06:43:43.468 --> 06:43:43.478 align:start position:0%
Forestry that we're implementing on the
 
06:43:46.110 --> 06:43:46.120 align:start position:0%
property so in some ways regardless of
 
06:43:48.628 --> 06:43:48.638 align:start position:0%
whether there's a carbon project or not
 
06:43:50.708 --> 06:43:50.718 align:start position:0%
the type of Forestry that we're
 
06:43:53.708 --> 06:43:53.718 align:start position:0%
implementing under our new plan involves
 
06:43:56.350 --> 06:43:56.360 align:start position:0%
more data collection on the front end of
 
06:43:58.990 --> 06:43:59.000 align:start position:0%
the of the Timber sale process so we
 
06:44:01.868 --> 06:44:01.878 align:start position:0%
have more folks out on the ground uh
 
06:44:04.388 --> 06:44:04.398 align:start position:0%
measuring trees marking
 
06:44:08.670 --> 06:44:08.680 align:start position:0%
trees um and then to speak specifically
 
06:44:12.310 --> 06:44:12.320 align:start position:0%
to the carbon side of things uh the
 
06:44:14.310 --> 06:44:14.320 align:start position:0%
requirements in a carbon project that
 
06:44:16.948 --> 06:44:16.958 align:start position:0%
lead to more potential jobs at least
 
06:44:20.590 --> 06:44:20.600 align:start position:0%
more man hours on the ground are again
 
06:44:23.750 --> 06:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
collection of data so it's a much more
 
06:44:27.868 --> 06:44:27.878 align:start position:0%
data intensive process to quantify how
 
06:44:29.670 --> 06:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
much carbon you have standing in the
 
06:44:32.030 --> 06:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
woods than it is to quantify the amount
 
06:44:37.070 --> 06:44:37.080 align:start position:0%
of Timber standing so uh it I don't have
 
06:44:39.590 --> 06:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
a number for you to say you know we're
 
06:44:42.548 --> 06:44:42.558 align:start position:0%
we're losing X and gaining y because it
 
06:44:46.430 --> 06:44:46.440 align:start position:0%
is such a transitional process but the
 
06:44:49.230 --> 06:44:49.240 align:start position:0%
jobs that we anticipate in the future
 
06:44:53.910 --> 06:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
will be more technical jobs more um
 
06:44:58.468 --> 06:44:58.478 align:start position:0%
forestry related jobs uh and and
 
06:45:03.628 --> 06:45:03.638 align:start position:0%
potentially uh less of the guys running
 
06:45:06.548 --> 06:45:06.558 align:start position:0%
chainsaws but but that I mean that is
 
06:45:09.350 --> 06:45:09.360 align:start position:0%
dependent on how folks manage properties
 
06:45:13.350 --> 06:45:13.360 align:start position:0%
uh but I I see more technical transition
 
06:45:16.750 --> 06:45:16.760 align:start position:0%
and uh that that is not just for New New
 
06:45:18.788 --> 06:45:18.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where we're seeing that in all
 
06:45:21.910 --> 06:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
the locations where we manage properties
 
06:45:24.030 --> 06:45:24.040 align:start position:0%
thank you uh just one more question Mr
 
06:45:27.270 --> 06:45:27.280 align:start position:0%
chair thank you you mentioned um Mr
 
06:45:30.590 --> 06:45:30.600 align:start position:0%
stanel that you are you're in agreement
 
06:45:32.628 --> 06:45:32.638 align:start position:0%
or you you've got some agreement going
 
06:45:35.788 --> 06:45:35.798 align:start position:0%
with Pittsburgh um to pay the Delta
 
06:45:37.468 --> 06:45:37.478 align:start position:0%
between what they were getting with the
 
06:45:40.590 --> 06:45:40.600 align:start position:0%
timer tax and and then the loss can you
 
06:45:44.230 --> 06:45:44.240 align:start position:0%
go into more details what that is sure
 
06:45:49.070 --> 06:45:49.080 align:start position:0%
um so the without getting into numbers
 
06:45:52.750 --> 06:45:52.760 align:start position:0%
uh what what we've agreed to do is to
 
06:45:55.548 --> 06:45:55.558 align:start position:0%
make up the gap between what has been
 
06:45:59.430 --> 06:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
paid to the town on average over the
 
06:46:02.868 --> 06:46:02.878 align:start position:0%
last five years relative to what is
 
06:46:05.510 --> 06:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
generated in in Severance tax during
 
06:46:09.070 --> 06:46:09.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:13.430 --> 06:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:15.548 --> 06:46:15.558 align:start position:0%
speaker thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
06:46:17.030 --> 06:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question have you been
 
06:46:21.350 --> 06:46:21.360 align:start position:0%
assessed that uh um the the tax under
 
06:46:24.110 --> 06:46:24.120 align:start position:0%
795 which says that if you don't cut the
 
06:46:27.468 --> 06:46:27.478 align:start position:0%
wood then you have to uh then the T the
 
06:46:30.670 --> 06:46:30.680 align:start position:0%
municipality can uh enforce the
 
06:46:33.830 --> 06:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
tax I I don't know the answer to that I
 
06:46:37.310 --> 06:46:37.320 align:start position:0%
don't think so but I I need to check on
 
06:46:37.320 --> 06:46:39.388 align:start position:0%
don't think so but I I need to check on
that

06:46:39.388 --> 06:46:39.398 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:46:42.388 --> 06:46:42.398 align:start position:0%
one any other questions for our
 
06:46:44.868 --> 06:46:44.878 align:start position:0%
speaker seeing none thank you for your
 
06:46:47.270 --> 06:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
testimony thank
 
06:46:50.150 --> 06:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
you the last speaker card I have in
 
06:46:53.070 --> 06:46:53.080 align:start position:0%
opposition Jason stock New Hampshire

06:47:10.910 --> 06:47:10.920 align:start position:0%
stock well good afternoon I'm good to

see you again uh Jason stock New

Hampshire Timberland Owners
 
06:47:17.070 --> 06:47:17.080 align:start position:0%
Association we represent Timberland
 
06:47:18.948 --> 06:47:18.958 align:start position:0%
owners in the forest products industry
 
06:47:21.590 --> 06:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
and I did come to you today to to speak
 
06:47:23.910 --> 06:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
in opposition to the bill and you know
 
06:47:25.708 --> 06:47:25.718 align:start position:0%
as the sponsor requested this isn't
 
06:47:28.990 --> 06:47:29.000 align:start position:0%
about Connecticut Lakes this is
 
06:47:32.350 --> 06:47:32.360 align:start position:0%
about many many many many many many
 
06:47:35.628 --> 06:47:35.638 align:start position:0%
other Timberland owners across the state
 
06:47:38.628 --> 06:47:38.638 align:start position:0%
um and when I look at the bill and I
 
06:47:39.590 --> 06:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
look at the
 
06:47:42.388 --> 06:47:42.398 align:start position:0%
mechanics you know first thing that
 
06:47:44.788 --> 06:47:44.798 align:start position:0%
struck me in in in our
 
06:47:48.110 --> 06:47:48.120 align:start position:0%
committee was we're trying to create a
 
06:47:51.510 --> 06:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
tax and insert it into a Timber tax an
 
06:47:53.590 --> 06:47:53.600 align:start position:0%
existing Timber tax statute it's been
 
06:47:56.150 --> 06:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
around since the
 
06:48:00.150 --> 06:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
1940s and to me it's it's like putting
 
06:48:02.150 --> 06:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
that the proverbial square peg in a
 
06:48:04.468 --> 06:48:04.478 align:start position:0%
round hole it just doesn't seem to fit
 
06:48:07.070 --> 06:48:07.080 align:start position:0%
an intent to generate it's one of those
 
06:48:12.190 --> 06:48:12.200 align:start position:0%
terms it's not defined what is it um as
 
06:48:15.110 --> 06:48:15.120 align:start position:0%
you know from last year the timber tax
 
06:48:18.110 --> 06:48:18.120 align:start position:0%
law gets tweaked and modified regularly
 
06:48:19.910 --> 06:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
in fact I had a bill before you last
 
06:48:22.788 --> 06:48:22.798 align:start position:0%
year about that and so that's a law
 
06:48:25.388 --> 06:48:25.398 align:start position:0%
that's evolved since the
 
06:48:30.110 --> 06:48:30.120 align:start position:0%
1940s um so to to take a new tax and
 
06:48:33.310 --> 06:48:33.320 align:start position:0%
kind of and try to insert it into seeven
 
06:48:35.788 --> 06:48:35.798 align:start position:0%
you know the timber tax statute I think
 
06:48:40.830 --> 06:48:40.840 align:start position:0%
is is is problematic um just
 
06:48:43.388 --> 06:48:43.398 align:start position:0%
operationally right now there are towns
 
06:48:45.350 --> 06:48:45.360 align:start position:0%
across the every town in across the
 
06:48:46.830 --> 06:48:46.840 align:start position:0%
state and and it's important to note
 
06:48:48.990 --> 06:48:49.000 align:start position:0%
that almost every town does a Timber
 
06:48:51.350 --> 06:48:51.360 align:start position:0%
sale every year there's a Timber sale
 
06:48:53.788 --> 06:48:53.798 align:start position:0%
that gets assessed the timber tax and
 
06:48:57.990 --> 06:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
even when I have a ticket a receipt that
 
06:49:01.468 --> 06:49:01.478 align:start position:0%
says Jason stocks White Pine stumpage
 
06:49:03.070 --> 06:49:03.080 align:start position:0%
was worth
 
06:49:05.830 --> 06:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
$250 per thousand board feet and I
 
06:49:07.548 --> 06:49:07.558 align:start position:0%
provide that to the town and I say all
 
06:49:09.230 --> 06:49:09.240 align:start position:0%
right I'm going to pay 10% I'm going to
 
06:49:12.590 --> 06:49:12.600 align:start position:0%
pay $25 on that there are still
 
06:49:15.590 --> 06:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
challenges with the assessment
 
06:49:18.590 --> 06:49:18.600 align:start position:0%
process and so having said that when I
 
06:49:22.190 --> 06:49:22.200 align:start position:0%
read lines 7 through n this tax shall be
 
06:49:24.388 --> 06:49:24.398 align:start position:0%
assessed yearly B basis on the estimated
 
06:49:26.670 --> 06:49:26.680 align:start position:0%
stumpage above Baseline at the end of
 
06:49:29.750 --> 06:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
the crediting period divided by 50 years
 
06:49:31.590 --> 06:49:31.600 align:start position:0%
or the length of the crediting period
 
06:49:32.788 --> 06:49:32.798 align:start position:0%
whichever is
 
06:49:35.590 --> 06:49:35.600 align:start position:0%
shorter ask a selectman to try and
 
06:49:39.590 --> 06:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
figure out how to assess that tax when I
 
06:49:40.990 --> 06:49:41.000 align:start position:0%
come in with my
 
06:49:44.310 --> 06:49:44.320 align:start position:0%
$250 per thousand board feet and they
 
06:49:46.868 --> 06:49:46.878 align:start position:0%
look at me and say what's a board foot
 
06:49:51.190 --> 06:49:51.200 align:start position:0%
and so to me it's some of the language
 
06:49:54.830 --> 06:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
it's just so conv uted and difficult I
 
06:49:56.830 --> 06:49:56.840 align:start position:0%
appreciate what the sponsors trying to
 
06:50:00.750 --> 06:50:00.760 align:start position:0%
do this is an issue we as an association
 
06:50:02.868 --> 06:50:02.878 align:start position:0%
have studied we have done a deep dive
 
06:50:04.830 --> 06:50:04.840 align:start position:0%
into this and as you can imagine I have
 
06:50:07.388 --> 06:50:07.398 align:start position:0%
members on all sides of it I have land
 
06:50:09.510 --> 06:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
owners that say Hey this is a property
 
06:50:12.388 --> 06:50:12.398 align:start position:0%
right me selling carbon credits is no
 
06:50:14.670 --> 06:50:14.680 align:start position:0%
different than me selling an easement a
 
06:50:19.190 --> 06:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
right of way selling you know a a uh you
 
06:50:21.510 --> 06:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
know anything one of these other kind of
 
06:50:24.990 --> 06:50:25.000 align:start position:0%
intangible items how is it any different
 
06:50:26.350 --> 06:50:26.360 align:start position:0%
and then I have members that are
 
06:50:28.468 --> 06:50:28.478 align:start position:0%
Sawmills and loggers that are saying
 
06:50:31.628 --> 06:50:31.638 align:start position:0%
wait I I I believe this is a a threat to
 
06:50:34.230 --> 06:50:34.240 align:start position:0%
my this is a Potential Threat to my wood
 
06:50:38.150 --> 06:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
supply and so we've looked at this we've
 
06:50:40.750 --> 06:50:40.760 align:start position:0%
come up with some you know we we've come
 
06:50:42.708 --> 06:50:42.718 align:start position:0%
up with some kind of guidelines or I'll
 
06:50:44.510 --> 06:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
call them sideboards when we look at
 
06:50:46.310 --> 06:50:46.320 align:start position:0%
this issue we recogn you have to
 
06:50:49.230 --> 06:50:49.240 align:start position:0%
recognize the property rights aspect of
 
06:50:52.110 --> 06:50:52.120 align:start position:0%
carbon credits um you also have to
 
06:50:55.030 --> 06:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
recognize there's a there's a potential
 
06:50:56.948 --> 06:50:56.958 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a potential impact on
 
06:51:00.750 --> 06:51:00.760 align:start position:0%
the backside I have members um that
 
06:51:03.110 --> 06:51:03.120 align:start position:0%
participate or planning to participate
 
06:51:05.510 --> 06:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
in this program where selling carbon
 
06:51:08.030 --> 06:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
credits fits perfect with their silver
 
06:51:10.830 --> 06:51:10.840 align:start position:0%
culture they have a piece of land
 
06:51:13.030 --> 06:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
they've gone through the land they've
 
06:51:14.750 --> 06:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
done Timber sales they've done the
 
06:51:16.910 --> 06:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
weeding they've done the thinning and
 
06:51:19.070 --> 06:51:19.080 align:start position:0%
now that Timber stand is approaching a
 
06:51:21.590 --> 06:51:21.600 align:start position:0%
growth mode all right I'm going to let
 
06:51:24.070 --> 06:51:24.080 align:start position:0%
it grow for the next 15 15 to 20 years
 
06:51:26.030 --> 06:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
let's get some nice big saw logs out
 
06:51:27.830 --> 06:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
there let's get some
 
06:51:31.270 --> 06:51:31.280 align:start position:0%
value at the same time I can sell some
 
06:51:33.628 --> 06:51:33.638 align:start position:0%
carbon credits to help pay the bills
 
06:51:36.670 --> 06:51:36.680 align:start position:0%
over the next 15 to 20 years and so
 
06:51:39.830 --> 06:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
these carbon credits they're all unique
 
06:51:42.590 --> 06:51:42.600 align:start position:0%
they're all very not only company
 
06:51:45.230 --> 06:51:45.240 align:start position:0%
specific they're site specific and
 
06:51:48.628 --> 06:51:48.638 align:start position:0%
ownership specific you heard from a
 
06:51:51.670 --> 06:51:51.680 align:start position:0%
corporate private Equity company I have
 
06:51:53.510 --> 06:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
members that are families that are
 
06:51:55.468 --> 06:51:55.478 align:start position:0%
looking at this saying hey this is an
 
06:51:58.868 --> 06:51:58.878 align:start position:0%
opportunity to kind of as as as Patrick
 
06:52:00.388 --> 06:52:00.398 align:start position:0%
Hackley said this is an opportunity to
 
06:52:02.310 --> 06:52:02.320 align:start position:0%
glean some Revenue while we're in that
 
06:52:06.150 --> 06:52:06.160 align:start position:0%
growth mode to hold so again this is
 
06:52:09.070 --> 06:52:09.080 align:start position:0%
incredibly complex there are a lot of
 
06:52:11.868 --> 06:52:11.878 align:start position:0%
facets the bill I again I attempt that
 
06:52:14.310 --> 06:52:14.320 align:start position:0%
the sponsor's efforts and what he's
 
06:52:18.948 --> 06:52:18.958 align:start position:0%
trying to do what I would say is
 
06:52:24.590 --> 06:52:24.600 align:start position:0%
795 provides that opportunity RS say
 
06:52:28.430 --> 06:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
795 it it it allows a municipality it's
 
06:52:30.830 --> 06:52:30.840 align:start position:0%
never to to my knowledge and the folks
 
06:52:33.510 --> 06:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
at Dr it's never been
 
06:52:36.030 --> 06:52:36.040 align:start position:0%
used um I've asked some folks and some
 
06:52:39.868 --> 06:52:39.878 align:start position:0%
of these were Old Timber tax codger from
 
06:52:43.708 --> 06:52:43.718 align:start position:0%
the going back a couple uh Generations
 
06:52:45.830 --> 06:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
there and say has anyone ever used this
 
06:52:48.388 --> 06:52:48.398 align:start position:0%
have you they said no but what it what
 
06:52:50.868 --> 06:52:50.878 align:start position:0%
it says is that the town can assess the
 
06:52:53.270 --> 06:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
tax if it's unreason if it feels their
 
06:52:55.590 --> 06:52:55.600 align:start position:0%
unreasonably deprived of Revenue because
 
06:52:57.468 --> 06:52:57.478 align:start position:0%
of the failure of an owner to cut
 
06:53:00.788 --> 06:53:00.798 align:start position:0%
standing wood or Timber when it shall
 
06:53:02.350 --> 06:53:02.360 align:start position:0%
when it shall have arrived at the degree
 
06:53:05.910 --> 06:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
of maturity most suitable for its use I
 
06:53:09.388 --> 06:53:09.398 align:start position:0%
think there's that's in statute to me
 
06:53:14.110 --> 06:53:14.120 align:start position:0%
this debate should be at Dr I think the
 
06:53:18.310 --> 06:53:18.320 align:start position:0%
the the point is have Dr ask them you
 
06:53:21.430 --> 06:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
can adopt rules you have this you have
 
06:53:23.910 --> 06:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
the statutory Authority
 
06:53:27.270 --> 06:53:27.280 align:start position:0%
to to do this but that's the arena to do
 
06:53:30.628 --> 06:53:30.638 align:start position:0%
it let the tax experts let the
 
06:53:33.468 --> 06:53:33.478 align:start position:0%
biometricians let let those folks work
 
06:53:37.590 --> 06:53:37.600 align:start position:0%
on this um this this particular bill I
 
06:53:40.388 --> 06:53:40.398 align:start position:0%
think is it's just incredibly complex
 
06:53:42.670 --> 06:53:42.680 align:start position:0%
and you start getting into dabbling into
 
06:53:45.150 --> 06:53:45.160 align:start position:0%
systems and into programs and forms and
 
06:53:47.990 --> 06:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
things that are IL defined and I I just
 
06:53:50.628 --> 06:53:50.638 align:start position:0%
fear that it's just going to create a
 
06:53:53.628 --> 06:53:53.638 align:start position:0%
bit of a mess um
 
06:53:56.468 --> 06:53:56.478 align:start position:0%
and I guess I would just you know and
 
06:53:59.310 --> 06:53:59.320 align:start position:0%
and there are other aspects of it the
 
06:54:02.868 --> 06:54:02.878 align:start position:0%
the the effect of if you are if you have
 
06:54:05.350 --> 06:54:05.360 align:start position:0%
a carbon program that looks at
 
06:54:08.150 --> 06:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
comparable properties um
 
06:54:11.350 --> 06:54:11.360 align:start position:0%
adjacent or comparable areas you use
 
06:54:14.868 --> 06:54:14.878 align:start position:0%
comparable areas within 50 miles of your
 
06:54:17.468 --> 06:54:17.478 align:start position:0%
property well if I'm a a timber land
 
06:54:19.230 --> 06:54:19.240 align:start position:0%
owner and I happen to own a piece of
 
06:54:21.190 --> 06:54:21.200 align:start position:0%
land that's adjacent to the White
 
06:54:23.190 --> 06:54:23.200 align:start position:0%
Mountain National Forest
 
06:54:26.548 --> 06:54:26.558 align:start position:0%
Wilderness Area very different ownership
 
06:54:29.070 --> 06:54:29.080 align:start position:0%
very different very different type of
 
06:54:31.948 --> 06:54:31.958 align:start position:0%
management there than say A you know a
 
06:54:33.910 --> 06:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
typical typical tree farmer or
 
06:54:36.910 --> 06:54:36.920 align:start position:0%
Timberland owner and so now to say all
 
06:54:39.670 --> 06:54:39.680 align:start position:0%
right our solution for those types of
 
06:54:41.708 --> 06:54:41.718 align:start position:0%
programs the comparable area programs
 
06:54:44.350 --> 06:54:44.360 align:start position:0%
we're going to apply it to 50 you know
 
06:54:47.628 --> 06:54:47.638 align:start position:0%
lands within 50 miles may not you may
 
06:54:49.948 --> 06:54:49.958 align:start position:0%
not be comparing Apples to Apples in
 
06:54:52.708 --> 06:54:52.718 align:start position:0%
terms of ownership but also ownership
 
06:54:55.670 --> 06:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
objectives and management so again I
 
06:54:59.230 --> 06:54:59.240 align:start position:0%
would I would urge um inexpedient to
 
06:55:03.830 --> 06:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
legislate on this um and I would also
 
06:55:07.190 --> 06:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
offer that if the committee is is really
 
06:55:10.030 --> 06:55:10.040 align:start position:0%
excited about learning more about this
 
06:55:11.868 --> 06:55:11.878 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly who comes from a
 
06:55:15.230 --> 06:55:15.240 align:start position:0%
long family a long line of Timberman um
 
06:55:19.070 --> 06:55:19.080 align:start position:0%
gave you a great kind of 101 but Charlie
 
06:55:21.548 --> 06:55:21.558 align:start position:0%
LC who work who's a consultant out of
 
06:55:23.990 --> 06:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
the Anum area he actually has a grant
 
06:55:25.830 --> 06:55:25.840 align:start position:0%
from the state for a group of State
 
06:55:28.670 --> 06:55:28.680 align:start position:0%
Forester associations has a carbon 101
 
06:55:30.590 --> 06:55:30.600 align:start position:0%
presentation I think you may have seen
 
06:55:32.430 --> 06:55:32.440 align:start position:0%
it representative Kelly I know he's
 
06:55:35.190 --> 06:55:35.200 align:start position:0%
presented up north on several occasions
 
06:55:37.670 --> 06:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
he can come and give you an explanation
 
06:55:41.590 --> 06:55:41.600 align:start position:0%
of kind of how this works um how it
 
06:55:43.670 --> 06:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
works I know he's later this month he's
 
06:55:45.548 --> 06:55:45.558 align:start position:0%
going to be giving a similar pre that
 
06:55:47.430 --> 06:55:47.440 align:start position:0%
presentation I should say to the Science
 
06:55:50.388 --> 06:55:50.398 align:start position:0%
and Tech committee it might be um an
 
06:55:52.590 --> 06:55:52.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to either piggyback with
 
06:55:55.110 --> 06:55:55.120 align:start position:0%
that or maybe have him kind of have a a
 
06:55:58.150 --> 06:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
dual showing um have him come over but
 
06:56:00.830 --> 06:56:00.840 align:start position:0%
it could give you an idea of kind of the
 
06:56:04.388 --> 06:56:04.398 align:start position:0%
magnitude of this these markets kind of
 
06:56:06.948 --> 06:56:06.958 align:start position:0%
how they work it is a new animal for
 
06:56:08.670 --> 06:56:08.680 align:start position:0%
Timberland owners and I can tell you in
 
06:56:10.468 --> 06:56:10.478 align:start position:0%
the forest products industry this seems
 
06:56:13.788 --> 06:56:13.798 align:start position:0%
to be these days um be beyond the the
 
06:56:15.750 --> 06:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
fact that it's been raining for 40 days
 
06:56:18.030 --> 06:56:18.040 align:start position:0%
and 40 nights it seems this is the other
 
06:56:20.190 --> 06:56:20.200 align:start position:0%
thing that people are talking about is
 
06:56:22.190 --> 06:56:22.200 align:start position:0%
what's going on with these carbon price
 
06:56:23.708 --> 06:56:23.718 align:start position:0%
project projects and how's that
 
06:56:27.070 --> 06:56:27.080 align:start position:0%
affecting wood supply so I'm I'm happy
 
06:56:30.430 --> 06:56:30.440 align:start position:0%
to try to answer questions um like I
 
06:56:34.070 --> 06:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
said uh I I would urge if you're
 
06:56:37.708 --> 06:56:37.718 align:start position:0%
interested um Avail yourself uh
 
06:56:39.628 --> 06:56:39.638 align:start position:0%
representative harb knows Charlie from
 
06:56:41.468 --> 06:56:41.478 align:start position:0%
the lowgrade
 
06:56:43.548 --> 06:56:43.558 align:start position:0%
commission and he usually does a pretty
 
06:56:46.510 --> 06:56:46.520 align:start position:0%
good job at mapping it laying out issues
 
06:56:48.830 --> 06:56:48.840 align:start position:0%
particularly complex issues as this I'll
 
06:56:51.708 --> 06:56:51.718 align:start position:0%
conclude my comments any questions for
 
06:56:54.230 --> 06:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
Mr stock
 
06:56:57.110 --> 06:56:57.120 align:start position:0%
representative Derby thank you Mr chair
 
06:56:59.230 --> 06:56:59.240 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question certainly
 
06:57:03.030 --> 06:57:03.040 align:start position:0%
um yeah so you know uh along the lines
 
06:57:05.110 --> 06:57:05.120 align:start position:0%
of what representative wolf was asking
 
06:57:08.030 --> 06:57:08.040 align:start position:0%
earlier I I I get it now right like the
 
06:57:12.150 --> 06:57:12.160 align:start position:0%
loss of the loss of wood um and I can
 
06:57:15.070 --> 06:57:15.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate the um boss of you know wood
 
06:57:17.510 --> 06:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
products and and all the secondary um
 
06:57:21.910 --> 06:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
markets of that it's clear that you
 
06:57:23.670 --> 06:57:23.680 align:start position:0%
you're talking about it with you know
 
06:57:26.788 --> 06:57:26.798 align:start position:0%
people in your organization um we heard
 
06:57:29.350 --> 06:57:29.360 align:start position:0%
testimony a minute ago um from uh an
 
06:57:31.070 --> 06:57:31.080 align:start position:0%
organization that's actually you know
 
06:57:33.468 --> 06:57:33.478 align:start position:0%
owns these that carbon credits are
 
06:57:34.788 --> 06:57:34.798 align:start position:0%
coming and they're coming fast to New
 
06:57:36.510 --> 06:57:36.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you know we're a very heavily
 
06:57:40.510 --> 06:57:40.520 align:start position:0%
wooded State um and we have we provide
 
06:57:42.548 --> 06:57:42.558 align:start position:0%
great tax breaks to you know
 
06:57:44.310 --> 06:57:44.320 align:start position:0%
conservation areas with you know current
 
06:57:46.868 --> 06:57:46.878 align:start position:0%
the current use rules right so what
 
06:57:49.788 --> 06:57:49.798 align:start position:0%
would your recommendation be I I I
 
06:57:53.030 --> 06:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
understand 795 right but
 
06:57:55.750 --> 06:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
it it is gray and it's not clear it's
 
06:57:57.910 --> 06:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
gray because it you said it hasn't been
 
06:57:59.788 --> 06:57:59.798 align:start position:0%
used it's not clear how often you could
 
06:58:01.910 --> 06:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
enforce that I think representative
 
06:58:05.750 --> 06:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
Kelly's Bill about a yearly um credit to
 
06:58:08.070 --> 06:58:08.080 align:start position:0%
basically spread out the cost makes
 
06:58:11.590 --> 06:58:11.600 align:start position:0%
sense how would you um which which may
 
06:58:13.948 --> 06:58:13.958 align:start position:0%
really encourage encourage the cutting
 
06:58:16.548 --> 06:58:16.558 align:start position:0%
of wood because it actually costs more
 
06:58:19.948 --> 06:58:19.958 align:start position:0%
to to grow these Force so what would you
 
06:58:21.430 --> 06:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
do you have a suggestion do your members
 
06:58:24.110 --> 06:58:24.120 align:start position:0%
have a suggestion as to how to keep that
 
06:58:28.430 --> 06:58:28.440 align:start position:0%
wood supply um Market flowing to avoid
 
06:58:30.430 --> 06:58:30.440 align:start position:0%
the whole state going to carbon credits
 
06:58:34.110 --> 06:58:34.120 align:start position:0%
sure sure well I think first off carbon
 
06:58:36.750 --> 06:58:36.760 align:start position:0%
credits are here so you made the comment
 
06:58:39.548 --> 06:58:39.558 align:start position:0%
they're coming oh they're here they've
 
06:58:41.750 --> 06:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
been here as you heard earlier for at
 
06:58:44.628 --> 06:58:44.638 align:start position:0%
least 10 years and many time and in the
 
06:58:46.388 --> 06:58:46.398 align:start position:0%
case of Connecticut Lakes no one really
 
06:58:48.910 --> 06:58:48.920 align:start position:0%
knew about it so they are here you have
 
06:58:50.670 --> 06:58:50.680 align:start position:0%
properties being managed or and that
 
06:58:52.590 --> 06:58:52.600 align:start position:0%
have been managed that have carbon
 
06:58:57.070 --> 06:58:57.080 align:start position:0%
programs on them so so that's point one
 
06:58:59.868 --> 06:58:59.878 align:start position:0%
I think you know the other to get to the
 
06:59:01.708 --> 06:59:01.718 align:start position:0%
your the other points of your question
 
06:59:04.230 --> 06:59:04.240 align:start position:0%
is I think you know
 
06:59:08.110 --> 06:59:08.120 align:start position:0%
795 is is yes it's very broad it's
 
06:59:10.788 --> 06:59:10.798 align:start position:0%
broadly written but I think there's I
 
06:59:14.670 --> 06:59:14.680 align:start position:0%
think you know I would I would again
 
06:59:18.990 --> 06:59:19.000 align:start position:0%
suggest that's where let Dr develop some
 
06:59:21.708 --> 06:59:21.718 align:start position:0%
rules and guidance around that I think
 
06:59:23.590 --> 06:59:23.600 align:start position:0%
that would be that would be the
 
06:59:27.190 --> 06:59:27.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate means of doing that um to
 
06:59:30.868 --> 06:59:30.878 align:start position:0%
create a a new a new tax and try to
 
06:59:34.548 --> 06:59:34.558 align:start position:0%
insert that um the other piece of this
 
06:59:38.750 --> 06:59:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:41.750 --> 06:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
um again I I just I I kind of come back
 
06:59:44.350 --> 06:59:44.360 align:start position:0%
to the complexity of this and just the
 
06:59:47.708 --> 06:59:47.718 align:start position:0%
ability to administer manage it and even
 
06:59:50.788 --> 06:59:50.798 align:start position:0%
figure out how to produce a tax
 
06:59:53.270 --> 06:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
bill you you know know when you look at
 
06:59:53.280 --> 06:59:55.070 align:start position:0%
bill you you know know when you look at
stumpage

06:59:55.070 --> 06:59:55.080 align:start position:0%
stumpage
 
06:59:57.830 --> 06:59:57.840 align:start position:0%
values stumpage Valu is the value of
 
06:59:59.708 --> 06:59:59.718 align:start position:0%
that tree and if you're using that as
 
07:00:02.230 --> 07:00:02.240 align:start position:0%
part in comparing that to baselines well
 
07:00:05.230 --> 07:00:05.240 align:start position:0%
that tree may be any number of species
 
07:00:07.388 --> 07:00:07.398 align:start position:0%
which all have different values it may
 
07:00:11.310 --> 07:00:11.320 align:start position:0%
be very nice veneer quality high quality
 
07:00:13.548 --> 07:00:13.558 align:start position:0%
or it may be a scraggly tree that should
 
07:00:16.750 --> 07:00:16.760 align:start position:0%
be chipped or sent to a bul wood and so
 
07:00:18.910 --> 07:00:18.920 align:start position:0%
to try to do this kind of
 
07:00:22.110 --> 07:00:22.120 align:start position:0%
wholesale across an entire ownership and
 
07:00:24.110 --> 07:00:24.120 align:start position:0%
and then and then use that as a means of
 
07:00:24.120 --> 07:00:25.310 align:start position:0%
and then and then use that as a means of
assessing

07:00:25.310 --> 07:00:25.320 align:start position:0%
assessing
 
07:00:27.708 --> 07:00:27.718 align:start position:0%
attacks um kind of like we talked about
 
07:00:30.070 --> 07:00:30.080 align:start position:0%
before you would have to almost annually
 
07:00:32.548 --> 07:00:32.558 align:start position:0%
do cruises on property to kind of look
 
07:00:35.628 --> 07:00:35.638 align:start position:0%
at the trees and say okay yeah this red
 
07:00:38.910 --> 07:00:38.920 align:start position:0%
oak is really is really growing well
 
07:00:40.510 --> 07:00:40.520 align:start position:0%
they're hitting the baseline or they're
 
07:00:43.590 --> 07:00:43.600 align:start position:0%
above Baseline boy that that red you
 
07:00:45.388 --> 07:00:45.398 align:start position:0%
know that black Birch isn't doing as
 
07:00:49.350 --> 07:00:49.360 align:start position:0%
well and so let's modify it I just see
 
07:00:52.708 --> 07:00:52.718 align:start position:0%
this is so complex I think I again I
 
07:00:54.670 --> 07:00:54.680 align:start position:0%
come back I think there's a mechanism in
 
07:00:56.670 --> 07:00:56.680 align:start position:0%
place I think that
 
07:01:01.708 --> 07:01:01.718 align:start position:0%
mechanism is is Dr in 795 and I would I
 
07:01:03.788 --> 07:01:03.798 align:start position:0%
would encourage that's the venue to do
 
07:01:06.150 --> 07:01:06.160 align:start position:0%
it they are the they are the tax
 
07:01:08.910 --> 07:01:08.920 align:start position:0%
assessment efforts experts and they're
 
07:01:12.670 --> 07:01:12.680 align:start position:0%
the timber tax experts so I hope I hope
 
07:01:15.030 --> 07:01:15.040 align:start position:0%
I answered your question I I that's that
 
07:01:17.190 --> 07:01:17.200 align:start position:0%
you know to your point what was our
 
07:01:19.070 --> 07:01:19.080 align:start position:0%
what's our
 
07:01:19.080 --> 07:01:21.030 align:start position:0%
what's our
suggestion

07:01:21.030 --> 07:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
suggestion
 
07:01:21.040 --> 07:01:24.110 align:start position:0%
suggestion
795

07:01:24.110 --> 07:01:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:25.350 --> 07:01:25.360 align:start position:0%
any other
 
07:01:29.990 --> 07:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
questions um I just have a quick one um
 
07:01:34.548 --> 07:01:34.558 align:start position:0%
how do we know that every town has um
 
07:01:38.070 --> 07:01:38.080 align:start position:0%
had a Timber cut in the last year great
 
07:01:40.110 --> 07:01:40.120 align:start position:0%
question if you recall from our
 
07:01:42.270 --> 07:01:42.280 align:start position:0%
testimony last year on the timber tax
 
07:01:45.070 --> 07:01:45.080 align:start position:0%
bill so each so when I go to do the
 
07:01:48.350 --> 07:01:48.360 align:start position:0%
timber Harvest I submit an intent to cut
 
07:01:51.548 --> 07:01:51.558 align:start position:0%
that goes into the into the town a copy
 
07:01:54.070 --> 07:01:54.080 align:start position:0%
goes to the state the state keeps that
 
07:01:57.548 --> 07:01:57.558 align:start position:0%
and cataloges that and so I do my Timber
 
07:01:59.990 --> 07:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
sale at the end of the Timber sale I
 
07:02:02.830 --> 07:02:02.840 align:start position:0%
file what's called a reportive cut so I
 
07:02:04.628 --> 07:02:04.638 align:start position:0%
give my intent to cut this is what we
 
07:02:06.310 --> 07:02:06.320 align:start position:0%
think is out there this is what we think
 
07:02:09.590 --> 07:02:09.600 align:start position:0%
we'll do I do my Timber sale then I file
 
07:02:11.990 --> 07:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
my report and that based on that report
 
07:02:14.750 --> 07:02:14.760 align:start position:0%
is what what I pay my taxes on the
 
07:02:17.990 --> 07:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
report of cut also goes to the state so
 
07:02:19.910 --> 07:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
that's why I can sit up here and say on
 
07:02:21.708 --> 07:02:21.718 align:start position:0%
a typical year the state of New
 
07:02:24.670 --> 07:02:24.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Hampshire about three to 3.2
 
07:02:27.270 --> 07:02:27.280 align:start position:0%
million tons of wood all products all
 
07:02:29.990 --> 07:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
species are harvested where Jason get
 
07:02:31.990 --> 07:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
that number he got I look at those
 
07:02:35.230 --> 07:02:35.240 align:start position:0%
Timber tax records and on a Town Bytown
 
07:02:37.750 --> 07:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
basis and they list them by Harvest you
 
07:02:39.910 --> 07:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
know project number they usually they
 
07:02:43.110 --> 07:02:43.120 align:start position:0%
list them um by number like project
 
07:02:46.510 --> 07:02:46.520 align:start position:0%
number so your town would be listed if
 
07:02:49.628 --> 07:02:49.638 align:start position:0%
you it's an interesting exercise go go
 
07:02:50.990 --> 07:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue and you can look
 
07:02:53.388 --> 07:02:53.398 align:start position:0%
and see right there what was what was
 
07:02:57.510 --> 07:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
harvested and what and but that's all Dr
 
07:02:59.548 --> 07:02:59.558 align:start position:0%
again they're the experts on this they
 
07:03:02.110 --> 07:03:02.120 align:start position:0%
track this
 
07:03:05.948 --> 07:03:05.958 align:start position:0%
stuff thank you okay you're welcome any
 
07:03:05.958 --> 07:03:07.510 align:start position:0%
stuff thank you okay you're welcome any
