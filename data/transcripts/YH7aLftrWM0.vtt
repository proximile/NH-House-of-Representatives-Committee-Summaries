00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.470 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 align:start position:0%
seeing that it's uh one o'clock uh i'm
 
00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:49.039 align:start position:0%
going to go ahead and open the hearing
 
00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 align:start position:0%
on house bill
 
00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:52.790 align:start position:0%
on house bill
1677

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 align:start position:0%
1677
 
00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:55.039 align:start position:0%
an act relative to the administration
 
00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
and settlement of claims of abuse at the
 
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 align:start position:0%
youth development center and making an
 
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 align:start position:0%
appropriation therefore
 
00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 align:start position:0%
this is a
 
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
a combined
 
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 align:start position:0%
committee hearing
 
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 align:start position:0%
because we found that the jurisdiction
 
00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 align:start position:0%
belongs in in
 
00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
probably two of our finance
 
00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 align:start position:0%
subcommittees and so chairman emerick is
 
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
sitting to my left and uh and he has uh
 
00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 align:start position:0%
the right to go ahead and interject any
 
00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 align:start position:0%
time he wants
 
00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
this is going to be
 
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.109 align:start position:0%
this is going to be
a

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.510 align:start position:0%
a
relatively

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
relatively
 
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 align:start position:0%
fluid session
 
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.310 align:start position:0%
fluid session
because

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 align:start position:0%
i i understand this
 
00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 align:start position:0%
uh to need to be a
 
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
a working session we have
 
00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 align:start position:0%
this is a complicated bill
 
00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 align:start position:0%
we want to spend 100 million dollars
 
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of money so we need to be
 
00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 align:start position:0%
very sure of what we're doing
 
00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 align:start position:0%
um so so we pr will probably end up
 
00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 align:start position:0%
having at least one other working group
 
00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 align:start position:0%
meeting later
 
00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 align:start position:0%
is there anyone here representing the
 
00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office
 
00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 align:start position:0%

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 align:start position:0%
all right we'll we'll get to you
 
00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.670 align:start position:0%
all right we'll we'll get to you
um

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:06.789 align:start position:0%
um
now

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 align:start position:0%
um for
 
00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 align:start position:0%
uh sort of a
 
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 align:start position:0%
social note um
 
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
representative rogers is is here
 
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
uh she
 
00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 align:start position:0%
uh is is undergoing some treatment that
 
00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:22.470 align:start position:0%
uh is is undergoing some treatment that
has

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 align:start position:0%
made her vulnerable particularly to the
 
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 align:start position:0%
coronavirus and so if we could maintain
 
00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 align:start position:0%
social distance from her representative
 
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.229 align:start position:0%
social distance from her representative
walls

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 align:start position:0%
walls
 
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 align:start position:0%
could you could would you have room to
 
00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 align:start position:0%
move further away or are you okay the
 
00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 align:start position:0%
all right no i just i just want to make
 
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.070 align:start position:0%
all right no i just i just want to make
sure

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 align:start position:0%
that representative rogers controls her
 
00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 align:start position:0%
personal space over there okay
 
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
all right very good
 
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:51.670 align:start position:0%
all right very good
uh

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.949 align:start position:0%
uh
so

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.710 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
what am i forgetting representative
 
00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:00.159 align:start position:0%
weiler to kick this thing off uh call
 
00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:02.159 align:start position:0%
our first person up
 
00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 align:start position:0%
from the ag
 
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.149 align:start position:0%
from the ag
yeah

00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:06.159 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 align:start position:0%
so why don't you come forward i i've
 
00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 align:start position:0%
gone through this bill
 
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 align:start position:0%
in a lot of detail
 
00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 align:start position:0%
and i have perhaps
 
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 align:start position:0%
20 or 25 questions so so i'm going to
 
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.110 align:start position:0%
20 or 25 questions so so i'm going to
let

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 align:start position:0%
let
 
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 align:start position:0%
others ask questions and keep track and
 
00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 align:start position:0%
hopefully everything will get asked and
 
00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 align:start position:0%
answered before we're through
 
00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 align:start position:0%
before we get done though or get started
 
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
i i want to make sure i understand some
 
00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 align:start position:0%
context and so i i'd like you to
 
00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 align:start position:0%
correct me or validate what i'm what i
 
00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
think is true
 
00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
what what i think is true
 
00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:03:48.149 --> 00:03:48.159 align:start position:0%
uh attorney general formella
 
00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 align:start position:0%
has been intending to spend some time
 
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 align:start position:0%
with the claimants
 
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 align:start position:0%
and attorney who's representing a number
 
00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 align:start position:0%
of the claimants
 
00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
with the idea that they would sit down
 
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 align:start position:0%
and and try to make sure they understand
 
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
how this process ought to work
 
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 align:start position:0%
and that their
 
00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 align:start position:0%
next meeting is on monday
 
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
and that after that monday meeting
 
00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:14.159 align:start position:0%
it's entirely possible they may come to
 
00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 align:start position:0%
some agreements that could cause us to
 
00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:18.199 align:start position:0%
want to amend
 
00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:21.199 align:start position:0%
1677. that that's my understanding could
 
00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
you could you correct or clarify that
 
00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
yes representative and
 
00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 align:start position:0%
we need to know who you are for the
 
00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
record i'm assistant attorney general
 
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 align:start position:0%
jennifer ramsey and uh general formula
 
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
may walk in at any moment uh he was
 
00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
planning to be here but i know he has
 
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 align:start position:0%
governor and council today as well so
 
00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 align:start position:0%
uh you are correct we have a meeting
 
00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
scheduled monday with um plaintiff's
 
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.430 align:start position:0%
scheduled monday with um plaintiff's
council

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
council
 
00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.110 align:start position:0%
council
we've

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 align:start position:0%
we've
 
00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:54.639 align:start position:0%
been promised a
 
00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
proposal from them
 
00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
and we'll have a few days to review that
 
00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
and then go through it with them our
 
00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
goal is to try to resolve if not all of
 
00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
their concerns as many of them as we can
 
00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
so that if we come back to you in
 
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
another working session we'll have a
 
00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
proposed language to recommend to you
 
00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 align:start position:0%
that addresses hopefully as many of
 
00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:16.639 align:start position:0%
those concerns as we can we've also
 
00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
reached out to all of the other public
 
00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
commenters at
 
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 align:start position:0%
last week's hearing
 
00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:24.639 align:start position:0%
and we have uh one agreement with
 
00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320 align:start position:0%
respect to the right to know concern
 
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
that was raised and i have some language
 
00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 align:start position:0%
that i can present to the group if they
 
00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
want to see it today that will address
 
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
so that's that's good so you have
 
00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
already some proposed language you'd
 
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
like to share with the committee i do
 
00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
how would you like to do that do you
 
00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:44.639 align:start position:0%
have copies to distribute and do you
 
00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
want to
 
00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 align:start position:0%
read it or go over the highlights i made
 
00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 align:start position:0%
copies uh it is not
 
00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
probably in the proper form
 
00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 align:start position:0%
uh that you would like to see an
 
00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
amendment but i i interliniated the
 
00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
language that uh ms ordolano and i
 
00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
talked about that that she indicated
 
00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:04.639 align:start position:0%
would would satisfy her concerns
 
00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:05.590 align:start position:0%
would would satisfy her concerns
um

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:05.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
in the analysis section of the bill at
 
00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:09.919 align:start position:0%
roman three
 
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
uh after the end of that sentence
 
00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:15.199 align:start position:0%
we were proposing to insert the words
 
00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
accept for settlement agreements
 
00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry could you could you tell us
 
00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
again where you're looking on the first
 
00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
at roman three
 
00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
uh at the end of the sentence we
 
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
proposed to insert the words accept for
 
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
on the third to last page of the
 
00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:44.800 align:start position:0%
document which is numbered page five at
 
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
down towards the bottom there is roman
 
00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.670 align:start position:0%
down towards the bottom there is roman
13

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:57.749 --> 00:06:57.759 align:start position:0%
and at the end of that section we
 
00:06:59.909 --> 00:06:59.919 align:start position:0%
propose to add the language with the
 
00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:02.639 align:start position:0%
exception of settlement agreements which
 
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:07.360 align:start position:0%
shall remain subject to rsa 91 a
 
00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.950 align:start position:0%
shall remain subject to rsa 91 a
4

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
4
 
00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:11.039 align:start position:0%
roman 6
 
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:12.560 align:start position:0%
new sentence
 
00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
pursuant to that provision settlement
 
00:07:16.629 --> 00:07:16.639 align:start position:0%
agreements entered into between
 
00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
claimants and the administrator will
 
00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
remain available for public inspection
 
00:07:23.749 --> 00:07:23.759 align:start position:0%
except that the personally identifying
 
00:07:25.589 --> 00:07:25.599 align:start position:0%
information of the claimant shall be
 
00:07:25.599 --> 00:07:28.230 align:start position:0%
information of the claimant shall be
redacted

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
redacted
 
00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
so you're going to offer uh that in
 
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
writing so that i don't have to be a
 
00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
very good scribe absolutely i brought
 
00:07:36.629 --> 00:07:36.639 align:start position:0%
copies and i i think they went to the
 
00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:39.120 align:start position:0%
back i think you all do
 
00:07:42.469 --> 00:07:42.479 align:start position:0%
outstanding hole punches yeah
 
00:07:42.479 --> 00:07:44.309 align:start position:0%
outstanding hole punches yeah
um

00:07:44.309 --> 00:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:47.909 --> 00:07:47.919 align:start position:0%

00:07:50.869 --> 00:07:50.879 align:start position:0%
the coalition against uh sex sexual and
 
00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:53.360 align:start position:0%

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
so so give me a timeline assuming that
 
00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:13.430 align:start position:0%
so so give me a timeline assuming that
um

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:14.309 align:start position:0%
um
that

00:08:14.309 --> 00:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:08:16.869 --> 00:08:16.879 align:start position:0%
synergy between these brilliant groups
 
00:08:18.629 --> 00:08:18.639 align:start position:0%
will create new
 
00:08:18.639 --> 00:08:19.909 align:start position:0%
will create new
knowledge

00:08:19.909 --> 00:08:19.919 align:start position:0%
knowledge
 
00:08:19.919 --> 00:08:20.629 align:start position:0%
knowledge
uh

00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:08:22.629 --> 00:08:22.639 align:start position:0%
one one might we
 
00:08:26.309 --> 00:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
expect from that something written that
 
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
helps us understand what the the new
 
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
knowledge is and how it might affect
 
00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:34.399 align:start position:0%
i would think that if not by the end of
 
00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:36.240 align:start position:0%
next week certainly by the beginning of
 
00:08:38.389 --> 00:08:38.399 align:start position:0%
the following week we would be able to
 
00:08:38.399 --> 00:08:39.350 align:start position:0%
the following week we would be able to
come

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
come
 
00:08:41.509 --> 00:08:41.519 align:start position:0%
back to the committee with
 
00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
some written suggestions for ways to
 
00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
possibly amend the bill
 
00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
we'll do it on any time frame you need
 
00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:48.640 align:start position:0%
us to do
 
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
did you just say no later than one
 
00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.470 align:start position:0%
did you just say no later than one
february

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
february
 
00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
i think it goes to the beginning of the
 
00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
following week could you could you give
 
00:08:59.269 --> 00:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
me a date please because i i don't do
 
00:09:01.509 --> 00:09:01.519 align:start position:0%
math in my head well i'm struggling as
 
00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:12.230 align:start position:0%
 
yep

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
i think monday the 7th sounds right it's
 
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:15.760 align:start position:0%
friday friday's the fourth i believe
 
00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:18.240 align:start position:0%
yeah so monday the 7th
 
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
and then let me let me ask
 
00:09:22.389 --> 00:09:22.399 align:start position:0%
the finance chair
 
00:09:25.949 --> 00:09:25.959 align:start position:0%
if if we had a document amending
 
00:09:25.959 --> 00:09:27.670 align:start position:0%
if if we had a document amending
1677

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
1677
 
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:31.360 align:start position:0%
by the 10th of february is that too late
 
00:09:33.269 --> 00:09:33.279 align:start position:0%
in the finance committee process it is
 
00:09:33.279 --> 00:09:46.790 align:start position:0%
in the finance committee process it is
not

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:52.470 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
so madam chair i'd like to invite you to
 
00:09:56.389 --> 00:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
come sit up at the table if you'd like
 
00:09:58.230 --> 00:09:58.240 align:start position:0%
what you know whatever you want this is
 
00:10:00.389 --> 00:10:00.399 align:start position:0%
this is a fairly informal
 
00:10:00.399 --> 00:10:02.069 align:start position:0%
this is a fairly informal
hearing

00:10:02.069 --> 00:10:02.079 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:04.160 align:start position:0%
no no she's already i meant i meant like
 
00:10:05.269 --> 00:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
up here
 
00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh at the dinner table but uh
 
00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
00:10:12.069 --> 00:10:12.079 align:start position:0%
very good i so i think that timeline
 
00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
works and and that and that you've
 
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
committed the attorney general to
 
00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
7 february
 
00:10:21.829 --> 00:10:21.839 align:start position:0%
okay that he's supposed to have all of
 
00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
our statutes annotated updated
 
00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
personally personally yeah
 
00:10:31.509 --> 00:10:31.519 align:start position:0%
yeah so so you can sit up at the table
 
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
there if you want mr attorney general
 
00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
what we just agreed to is that we
 
00:10:38.389 --> 00:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
understand that you have a number of
 
00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:40.399 align:start position:0%
critical working groups with a couple of
 
00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
different constituencies
 
00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and that um to the extent
 
00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
that you come up with new awareness of
 
00:10:51.509 --> 00:10:51.519 align:start position:0%
how this bill should be positioned
 
00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:56.240 align:start position:0%
you'll have a proposed amendment to 1677
 
00:10:59.910 --> 00:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
no later than close of business seven
 
00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:01.110 align:start position:0%
no later than close of business seven
february

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
february
 
00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:03.200 align:start position:0%
is that a commitment you think you can
 
00:11:05.269 --> 00:11:05.279 align:start position:0%
accept yes that sounds very workable to
 
00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
me okay i apologize for being late i
 
00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:08.720 align:start position:0%
just got out of governor and council
 
00:11:11.829 --> 00:11:11.839 align:start position:0%
that's that's quite all right um
 
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
okay so the part that you miss that's
 
00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
relevant to you is this is this is a
 
00:11:17.509 --> 00:11:17.519 align:start position:0%
working group and we're expecting that
 
00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to have other working group
 
00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:21.680 align:start position:0%
sessions and so this is going to be more
 
00:11:24.069 --> 00:11:24.079 align:start position:0%
informal than a traditional hearing
 
00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
might be um and that everyone who has uh
 
00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
questions or concerns we can enter into
 
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
a conversation as opposed to sort of the
 
00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.150 align:start position:0%
a conversation as opposed to sort of the
standard

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:34.160 align:start position:0%
standard
 
00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:36.720 align:start position:0%
hearing q a i think because we have
 
00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
members who have
 
00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:40.160 align:start position:0%
co-sponsored this bill they may have
 
00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
comments to make as well and i think
 
00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
that's perfectly fine in a working group
 
00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.230 align:start position:0%
that's perfectly fine in a working group
environment

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:46.240 align:start position:0%
environment
 
00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
all right so i'm going to
 
00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
open it up to the committee
 
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:52.870 align:start position:0%
open it up to the committee
and

00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:11:54.829 --> 00:11:54.839 align:start position:0%
i had
 
00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
questions um
 
00:11:59.030 --> 00:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
that was that i think may have just been
 
00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
dealt with
 
00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:02.720 align:start position:0%
and i discussed this with representative
 
00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
lynn before the hearing
 
00:12:08.389 --> 00:12:08.399 align:start position:0%
and my my general concern
 
00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
do you need a moment to get organized
 
00:12:16.389 --> 00:12:16.399 align:start position:0%

or there's still an issue okay
 
00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
um the questions i had was that we
 
00:13:08.389 --> 00:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
we had a perception
 
00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
that paragraph three
 
00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
until or that section until you
 
00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
corrected it
 
00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
was probably a violation of article
 
00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
eight of the new hampshire constitution
 
00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:22.240 align:start position:0%
and then conflicted with the 2015
 
00:13:24.389 --> 00:13:24.399 align:start position:0%
new hampshire doj guide for right to
 
00:13:24.399 --> 00:13:25.269 align:start position:0%
new hampshire doj guide for right to
know

00:13:25.269 --> 00:13:25.279 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
and so uh so the two questions related
 
00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
to that
 
00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
was um right right to know settlements
 
00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
or public info why did we want to exempt
 
00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:36.470 align:start position:0%
or public info why did we want to exempt
them

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:13:38.389 --> 00:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
and the other one was that the right to
 
00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
know provides privacy protections
 
00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
are those existing protections
 
00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.069 align:start position:0%
are those existing protections
insufficient

00:13:44.069 --> 00:13:44.079 align:start position:0%
insufficient
 
00:13:45.829 --> 00:13:45.839 align:start position:0%
and so i think you must have considered
 
00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
that and come up with some different
 
00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
language could you just talk us through
 
00:13:52.949 --> 00:13:52.959 align:start position:0%
what you were doing sure yeah i'll start
 
00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
by addressing
 
00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
the intent behind the language as it was
 
00:13:59.110 --> 00:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
originally i think we were focusing our
 
00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
thoughts on
 
00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
trying to keep as much confidentiality
 
00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
for victims as possible as they went
 
00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
through the process so records of what
 
00:14:09.189 --> 00:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
what did they say how did the interview
 
00:14:09.199 --> 00:14:10.150 align:start position:0%
what did they say how did the interview
go

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:10.160 align:start position:0%
go
 
00:14:12.389 --> 00:14:12.399 align:start position:0%
what were those exchanges like
 
00:14:12.399 --> 00:14:13.269 align:start position:0%
what were those exchanges like
um

00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:13.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:14.629 --> 00:14:14.639 align:start position:0%
we were not
 
00:14:17.269 --> 00:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
i think we we that was our focus we were
 
00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
not ever intending that
 
00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
the dollar amounts and what the ultimate
 
00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
result was would would not be public and
 
00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
that's where we can better balance to
 
00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
your point representative the
 
00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
requirements of the constitution article
 
00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
one part eight um
 
00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
or part one article eight sorry uh the
 
00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:36.949 align:start position:0%
or part one article eight sorry uh the
uh

00:14:36.949 --> 00:14:36.959 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
the privacy protections that are already
 
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
provided for in 91a
 
00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
i think what we're intending with this
 
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
language is to balance those two things
 
00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
so it the
 
00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:50.240 align:start position:0%
the ultimate outcome of these
 
00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:52.160 align:start position:0%
proceedings would be public how much
 
00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
money was given but we would still be
 
00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
able to protect the confidentiality of
 
00:14:58.470 --> 00:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
victims you know their names and their
 
00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
what happened leading up to the final
 
00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:02.870 align:start position:0%
what happened leading up to the final
outcome

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
outcome
 
00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
so i'm just spitballing here um
 
00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
just take it as a brainstorming effort
 
00:15:10.629 --> 00:15:10.639 align:start position:0%
yeah um
 
00:15:13.189 --> 00:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
would there be value you think
 
00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
in coming up with a
 
00:15:19.269 --> 00:15:19.279 align:start position:0%
an example type of disclosure format
 
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
that you might use
 
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
using obviously fictitious data if you
 
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
need any data just so that that people
 
00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:28.240 align:start position:0%
early on
 
00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
can can can see
 
00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:31.749 align:start position:0%
can can can see
uh

00:15:31.749 --> 00:15:31.759 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:15:33.509 --> 00:15:33.519 align:start position:0%
how they're how we're going to know this
 
00:15:35.189 --> 00:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
information what information you plan to
 
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
share is there any value in that
 
00:15:38.949 --> 00:15:38.959 align:start position:0%
i think so yeah
 
00:15:42.069 --> 00:15:42.079 align:start position:0%
showing a very basic example um i i do
 
00:15:43.189 --> 00:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
know that
 
00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
i think attorney ramsey has had
 
00:15:46.629 --> 00:15:46.639 align:start position:0%
correspondence with with new hampshire
 
00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
right to know
 
00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
so we're working on addressing kind of
 
00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
the specific concerns that have come out
 
00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
of those communities but i i think there
 
00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
would be value in that and we could
 
00:15:57.749 --> 00:15:57.759 align:start position:0%
certainly do that it might be a very
 
00:15:59.509 --> 00:15:59.519 align:start position:0%
basic template
 
00:16:01.829 --> 00:16:01.839 align:start position:0%
but but to show an example of what what
 
00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
would be disclosed
 
00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
so to give folks a sense of whether they
 
00:16:07.509 --> 00:16:07.519 align:start position:0%
think that's enough information or
 
00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
whether only seeing that
 
00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
still leaves more that should be
 
00:16:14.949 --> 00:16:14.959 align:start position:0%
shared publicly
 
00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for that is would it be
 
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
reasonable to expect that on the same
 
00:16:21.509 --> 00:16:21.519 align:start position:0%
seven february timeline yes i think so
 
00:16:21.519 --> 00:16:23.350 align:start position:0%
seven february timeline yes i think so
okay

00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
thank you are to the folks at the
 
00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
committee table and and the chair in the
 
00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
background are are there any questions
 
00:16:33.269 --> 00:16:33.279 align:start position:0%
that you'd like to review would you like
 
00:16:33.279 --> 00:16:36.069 align:start position:0%
that you'd like to review would you like
answered

00:16:36.069 --> 00:16:36.079 align:start position:0%
answered
 
00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:44.389 --> 00:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
is that one
 
00:16:46.949 --> 00:16:46.959 align:start position:0%
does that work okay um i have a number
 
00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
is this better
 
00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:04.079 align:start position:0%
i have a number of questions and i think
 
00:17:04.079 --> 00:17:05.429 align:start position:0%
i have a number of questions and i think
um

00:17:05.429 --> 00:17:05.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:06.789 --> 00:17:06.799 align:start position:0%
you're doing but i'm just going to kind
 
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
of some of the things i hope that you
 
00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:09.429 align:start position:0%
of some of the things i hope that you
would

00:17:09.429 --> 00:17:09.439 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:17:11.429 --> 00:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
um in this document you're going to give
 
00:17:13.909 --> 00:17:13.919 align:start position:0%
us on the seventh would be addressed
 
00:17:13.919 --> 00:17:15.829 align:start position:0%
us on the seventh would be addressed
um

00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:15.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
in it and they kind of fall under a few
 
00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:19.839 align:start position:0%
things the first one that i wanted to
 
00:17:21.669 --> 00:17:21.679 align:start position:0%
bring up is um
 
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
in the statement of purpose
 
00:17:26.309 --> 00:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
um i would like to see
 
00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
something stronger i know that i don't
 
00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
want us to admit to anything that would
 
00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
would um
 
00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
in any way jeopardize any of the the
 
00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
court actions and so forth that's coming
 
00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
forward but i know my understanding in
 
00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
dealing with victims in the past and
 
00:17:43.029 --> 00:17:43.039 align:start position:0%
dealing with
 
00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:44.720 align:start position:0%
some of the victim groups that are
 
00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:47.200 align:start position:0%
representing them it's important that to
 
00:17:48.789 --> 00:17:48.799 align:start position:0%
the victims that there'd be recognition
 
00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
that there was wrong done
 
00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:52.160 align:start position:0%
and i wondered if there's a way that we
 
00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
can work language
 
00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
into the statement of purpose
 
00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:17:59.510 --> 00:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
that doesn't while it doesn't admit
 
00:18:01.909 --> 00:18:01.919 align:start position:0%
guilt admits that there was something or
 
00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
that the legislature recognized
 
00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
that there was something wrong happening
 
00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
over the last 50 some odd years
 
00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.549 align:start position:0%
over the last 50 some odd years
with

00:18:12.549 --> 00:18:12.559 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:18:15.029 --> 00:18:15.039 align:start position:0%
children that were put in our charge
 
00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
um we had a
 
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
responsibility to protect people when
 
00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
they're in our charge and in our care
 
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
and um and that didn't happen and so i'd
 
00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
like to see if there's a way that
 
00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
language and i'm willing to
 
00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
work with anybody if i can be of any use
 
00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
with it but a statement of purpose that
 
00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:32.720 align:start position:0%
addresses that
 
00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:34.160 align:start position:0%
so that there's some kind of statement
 
00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
there that's um
 
00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
recognition of the victims that this
 
00:18:39.909 --> 00:18:39.919 align:start position:0%
wasn't the way we were meant to operate
 
00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
but do it in such a way that we don't
 
00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
make the state liable or any admissions
 
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:46.720 align:start position:0%
that would be a problem once it goes to
 
00:18:48.549 --> 00:18:48.559 align:start position:0%
court do you think that that's something
 
00:18:50.549 --> 00:18:50.559 align:start position:0%
that we could um
 
00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:52.640 align:start position:0%
incorporate into this
 
00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
yes representative i think that's
 
00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely something we could work on
 
00:18:57.669 --> 00:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
because i think we were initially you
 
00:18:59.669 --> 00:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
know we're lawyers so we're going to be
 
00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
cautious on that front but i think we
 
00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:03.440 align:start position:0%
there's definitely some some room to
 
00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
work on that okay because that's one
 
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
thing that i would very
 
00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
important to me to have some statement
 
00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
in there um the second thing comes into
 
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
um claim questions and i think this
 
00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
might be something you're looking to
 
00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
address is
 
00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:19.919 align:start position:0%
broadening out from just sexual abuse
 
00:19:19.919 --> 00:19:21.510 align:start position:0%
broadening out from just sexual abuse
to

00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
physical abuse and restraints and so
 
00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
forth when they were used improperly and
 
00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
traumatically to the victims and i know
 
00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
that your hesitation on the physical
 
00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
abuse was that
 
00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:32.710 align:start position:0%
abuse was that
um

00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:32.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:34.160 align:start position:0%
there are times that there might have
 
00:19:37.029 --> 00:19:37.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
done for the safety or whatever but is
 
00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
that that's one of the areas i presume
 
00:19:43.029 --> 00:19:43.039 align:start position:0%
you're going to address with the um
 
00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
document you're doing
 
00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:46.480 align:start position:0%
yes i think we'll definitely be talking
 
00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
about that with with the victim's
 
00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:50.240 align:start position:0%
counsel um
 
00:19:53.029 --> 00:19:53.039 align:start position:0%
one thing that i i should point out is
 
00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
that the way the bill is drafted is it
 
00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:56.150 align:start position:0%
that the way the bill is drafted is it
doesn't

00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
00:19:58.789 --> 00:19:58.799 align:start position:0%
it doesn't leave out physical abuse in
 
00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
the event that there's a victim who's
 
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
also suffered sexual abuse so if someone
 
00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
has suffered sexual abuse
 
00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
sort of additional physical abuse that
 
00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
they've also suffered would be taken
 
00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
into account i understand but there are
 
00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:12.320 align:start position:0%
some people that had physical abuse but
 
00:20:14.549 --> 00:20:14.559 align:start position:0%
um right it didn't come in to
 
00:20:16.789 --> 00:20:16.799 align:start position:0%
qualify in the statutes for sexual abuse
 
00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
yep yep okay yeah i just wanted to make
 
00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:21.200 align:start position:0%
sure that was clarified but but yes we
 
00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
we are going to talk about that uh okay
 
00:20:25.909 --> 00:20:25.919 align:start position:0%
i do you know i think for the reasons i
 
00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
articulated in the last hearing um
 
00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
you know i do have some concerns some
 
00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
pretty significant concerns with
 
00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:34.480 align:start position:0%
broadening that definition but i think
 
00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
for purposes of today it probably makes
 
00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
sense for us to have those conversations
 
00:20:40.149 --> 00:20:40.159 align:start position:0%
with with
 
00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
the victims counsel who appeared at the
 
00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:43.919 align:start position:0%
hearing last week and and have some more
 
00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
discussion on that i think before
 
00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
getting into that because it may be that
 
00:20:49.909 --> 00:20:49.919 align:start position:0%
we can get to a place that that i think
 
00:20:52.789 --> 00:20:52.799 align:start position:0%
would satisfy everyone and i'd
 
00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
i'd appreciate the opportunity to do
 
00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
some work on that before
 
00:20:57.669 --> 00:20:57.679 align:start position:0%
before really
 
00:20:59.190 --> 00:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day laying out to you
 
00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
my final kind of strong recommendation
 
00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
on what we do it's ultimately up to this
 
00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
committee and up to the legislature of
 
00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
course but i just wanted to enumerate
 
00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
some of the concerns i had yeah that i
 
00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
would hope would you just if mr chairman
 
00:21:12.789 --> 00:21:12.799 align:start position:0%
said okay if i just continue or do you
 
00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
want me to
 
00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:14.870 align:start position:0%
want me to
okay

00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:15.750 align:start position:0%
okay
um

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:18.549 --> 00:21:18.559 align:start position:0%
the other is a timeline question and
 
00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:20.240 align:start position:0%
kind of classifying these is in the
 
00:21:22.789 --> 00:21:22.799 align:start position:0%
timeline a few things first of all
 
00:21:22.799 --> 00:21:24.070 align:start position:0%
timeline a few things first of all
um

00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
the january 8 1980 deadline our date for
 
00:21:30.549 --> 00:21:30.559 align:start position:0%
when claimants only people that were um
 
00:21:32.789 --> 00:21:32.799 align:start position:0%
suffered anything after that i think a
 
00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:35.200 align:start position:0%
number of us talked about that um and my
 
00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
concern is somebody that was um
 
00:21:39.669 --> 00:21:39.679 align:start position:0%
abused or suffered something
 
00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
in 1960 or 1955 is still
 
00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:46.720 align:start position:0%
suffering as much as someone later so um
 
00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
is there a reason that we have to have a
 
00:21:51.029 --> 00:21:51.039 align:start position:0%
date in there or can we leave it
 
00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
that just anyone that's suffered
 
00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
any abuse or anyone that that
 
00:21:58.149 --> 00:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
is there do we have to have that 1980
 
00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
date on there or can we just not have a
 
00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
date at beginning yep we certainly don't
 
00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
have to have it any date uh we
 
00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
originally picked 1980 or
 
00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:12.320 align:start position:0%
we came up with 1980 based on i think as
 
00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
i said last week uh the best estimate at
 
00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
least i could come up with based on what
 
00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:17.200 align:start position:0%
i've seen through the criminal
 
00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
investigation where a lot of these
 
00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
allegations have centered
 
00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:22.230 align:start position:0%
allegations have centered
but

00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:23.190 align:start position:0%
but
but

00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:23.200 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
i think even just from a recommendation
 
00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
standpoint from my perspective we should
 
00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:29.440 align:start position:0%
talk about the date and then potentially
 
00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
moving it or or eliminating it you know
 
00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
the bill does
 
00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
provide that it's only the person
 
00:22:38.149 --> 00:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
themselves or if they're still alive but
 
00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
incapacitated their representative who
 
00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
can bring a claim
 
00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
um so it's not it's not like estates of
 
00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
decedents can can bring claims so
 
00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
there's that provides a natural kind of
 
00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
limit to how far back you would look
 
00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:52.240 align:start position:0%
so i
 
00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
anyway to answer your question yes i
 
00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
think from our perspective from a
 
00:22:57.510 --> 00:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
recommendation perspective definitely
 
00:22:58.789 --> 00:22:58.799 align:start position:0%
room to look at that and that's
 
00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
certainly an issue we plan on discussing
 
00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:04.640 align:start position:0%
when we meet with attorney vicenzo
 
00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
because i know that there's some support
 
00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
for having no date and having the
 
00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:12.400 align:start position:0%
limitations um in other ways if we could
 
00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
also with the the timeline uh the
 
00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
question of um
 
00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
how long people have the year and i
 
00:23:21.029 --> 00:23:21.039 align:start position:0%
think i addressed this to you before
 
00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
just the year and i understand
 
00:23:25.669 --> 00:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
compacting it but i think that um
 
00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:27.280 align:start position:0%
some of us have some myself and some
 
00:23:29.669 --> 00:23:29.679 align:start position:0%
other concern that that really limits
 
00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
because um
 
00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
a lot of these people have come forward
 
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
but a lot of them probably haven't
 
00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
either and
 
00:23:38.149 --> 00:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
some of them because of the nature of
 
00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:40.400 align:start position:0%
this could be in penal institutions
 
00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
could be in various places so that the
 
00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:45.200 align:start position:0%
year deadline could be problematic so i
 
00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
think um
 
00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:48.400 align:start position:0%
some of us would like to see that
 
00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:50.320 align:start position:0%
stretched a little bit longer and i'm
 
00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
not sure the right time you know if it's
 
00:23:54.789 --> 00:23:54.799 align:start position:0%
two years or three but one year seems
 
00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
terribly short
 
00:23:58.630 --> 00:23:58.640 align:start position:0%
absolutely and and again that i think
 
00:23:58.640 --> 00:23:59.830 align:start position:0%
absolutely and and again that i think
they're

00:23:59.830 --> 00:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
they're
 
00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:01.840 align:start position:0%
you know that there's plenty of room to
 
00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:04.240 align:start position:0%
have discussion around that i think i
 
00:24:06.149 --> 00:24:06.159 align:start position:0%
think it makes sense to have a period
 
00:24:07.669 --> 00:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
where there is a cut off date at some
 
00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
point because it you know
 
00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:12.320 align:start position:0%
i think we want to encourage folks who
 
00:24:13.269 --> 00:24:13.279 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day will be willing to
 
00:24:15.269 --> 00:24:15.279 align:start position:0%
come forward to come forward by a
 
00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:18.720 align:start position:0%
certain date so the state at some point
 
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
has knowledge of the full scope of this
 
00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
you know how many would potentially
 
00:24:24.549 --> 00:24:24.559 align:start position:0%
participate in this process but i i
 
00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely see your point that a year
 
00:24:27.909 --> 00:24:27.919 align:start position:0%
might be too short
 
00:24:27.919 --> 00:24:28.710 align:start position:0%
might be too short
so

00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:28.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
i think from my perspective that really
 
00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:32.480 align:start position:0%
just comes down to to what the
 
00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:34.240 align:start position:0%
legislature thinks is is the right
 
00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:36.400 align:start position:0%
balance and we can have that discussion
 
00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
again with attorney visanzo whose
 
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
victims counsel and
 
00:24:41.029 --> 00:24:41.039 align:start position:0%
have that discussion with others so
 
00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
representative rogers would you let me
 
00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
interject here
 
00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:46.240 align:start position:0%
that conversation triggered a couple of
 
00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:48.640 align:start position:0%
thoughts and i can't keep two things in
 
00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:50.320 align:start position:0%
my head for very long
 
00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:51.269 align:start position:0%
my head for very long
um

00:24:51.269 --> 00:24:51.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:51.279 --> 00:24:52.149 align:start position:0%
um
on

00:24:52.149 --> 00:24:52.159 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
on the on the one dealing with um the
 
00:24:58.710 --> 00:24:58.720 align:start position:0%
one year window to file claims
 
00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
i notice that there's language in there
 
00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:02.240 align:start position:0%
that says
 
00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:04.480 align:start position:0%
that the administrator
 
00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
can return a claim if there's
 
00:25:09.269 --> 00:25:09.279 align:start position:0%
insufficient information in the first
 
00:25:09.279 --> 00:25:10.230 align:start position:0%
insufficient information in the first
claim

00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:10.240 align:start position:0%
claim
 
00:25:11.909 --> 00:25:11.919 align:start position:0%
and uh and
 
00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
and it seemed like that could go a
 
00:25:15.669 --> 00:25:15.679 align:start position:0%
couple of times where a claim could get
 
00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
kicked back
 
00:25:19.029 --> 00:25:19.039 align:start position:0%
it's not really clear to me what happens
 
00:25:22.549 --> 00:25:22.559 align:start position:0%
to that uh one year timeline or deadline
 
00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
if if if they haven't actually gotten
 
00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
around to completing a claim
 
00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:30.640 align:start position:0%
in that year
 
00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
because of requested delays by the
 
00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
administrator to get more information
 
00:25:38.549 --> 00:25:38.559 align:start position:0%
does that extend the clock by
 
00:25:40.149 --> 00:25:40.159 align:start position:0%
the amount that the administrator
 
00:25:42.789 --> 00:25:42.799 align:start position:0%
requests it i i think that would be fair
 
00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
but it's not in the language as i see it
 
00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
yep i think and i'll let attorney ramsey
 
00:25:49.029 --> 00:25:49.039 align:start position:0%
correct me if she if she disagrees i
 
00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
think the intent would be that the the
 
00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:53.200 align:start position:0%
year deadline is by which you'd have to
 
00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
have made your submission
 
00:25:57.510 --> 00:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
if the administrator then comes back and
 
00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
asks for more information or feels that
 
00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
there was something missing
 
00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
you've you've gotten in the window at
 
00:26:06.549 --> 00:26:06.559 align:start position:0%
that point so i i
 
00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:08.320 align:start position:0%
we can make that certainly make that
 
00:26:10.549 --> 00:26:10.559 align:start position:0%
clearer but i think the intent was that
 
00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
it's not a year to get to the point
 
00:26:14.149 --> 00:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
where the administrator feels like
 
00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
you've submitted all the information you
 
00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:18.400 align:start position:0%
have to submit it's a year to have filed
 
00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
the claim in the first instance even if
 
00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:23.360 align:start position:0%
additional information is requested
 
00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
is that okay okay uh that that's great
 
00:26:27.669 --> 00:26:27.679 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm just an old hospital
 
00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:29.200 align:start position:0%
administrator i don't know how to read
 
00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:32.240 align:start position:0%
these laws so i i appreciate that uh
 
00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
then the other point
 
00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:36.230 align:start position:0%
then the other point
about

00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:38.870 align:start position:0%
about
potentially

00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:40.640 align:start position:0%
expanding the scope
 
00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
so that the primary issue isn't is
 
00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
beyond sexual abuse but may include
 
00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:51.669 --> 00:26:51.679 align:start position:0%
it just makes me wonder are these two
 
00:26:53.909 --> 00:26:53.919 align:start position:0%
different statute of limitations issues
 
00:26:58.470 --> 00:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
i i think the legislature passed a law
 
00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
recently saying there is no statute of
 
00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
limitations for sexual abuse and but i'd
 
00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
but if if we include physical abuse in
 
00:27:11.029 --> 00:27:11.039 align:start position:0%
the scope of what the claim can be
 
00:27:13.909 --> 00:27:13.919 align:start position:0%
would that would that suggest a
 
00:27:13.919 --> 00:27:14.950 align:start position:0%
would that would that suggest a
different

00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:15.830 align:start position:0%
different
um

00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:18.389 --> 00:27:18.399 align:start position:0%
date instead of 1980 for the physical
 
00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
abuse claims so it wouldn't necessarily
 
00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
suggest a different date than 1980 but i
 
00:27:25.669 --> 00:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
think what you're getting at is that
 
00:27:25.679 --> 00:27:26.549 align:start position:0%
think what you're getting at is that
there

00:27:26.549 --> 00:27:26.559 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:28.240 align:start position:0%
there are
 
00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
two separate statute limits there are
 
00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
separate statute limitations issues with
 
00:27:34.389 --> 00:27:34.399 align:start position:0%
with sexual abuse and physical abuse i
 
00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
think at the end of the day this
 
00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
this bill is essentially intended to
 
00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:42.480 align:start position:0%
to waive relevant statutes of
 
00:27:45.029 --> 00:27:45.039 align:start position:0%
limitations because you're going through
 
00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
an alternative process you're not you're
 
00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:50.720 align:start position:0%
not going to court so we're
 
00:27:53.029 --> 00:27:53.039 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be looking as part
 
00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
if someone files a claim
 
00:27:57.510 --> 00:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
really what we'd be looking at is to see
 
00:27:58.950 --> 00:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
whether they're allegations at least as
 
00:28:01.269 --> 00:28:01.279 align:start position:0%
it's drafted were we're af you know
 
00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
after 1980. um we're not going to be
 
00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:04.640 align:start position:0%
looking to see whether there's a
 
00:28:06.149 --> 00:28:06.159 align:start position:0%
separate statute of limitations in the
 
00:28:08.549 --> 00:28:08.559 align:start position:0%
rsas that may or may not apply
 
00:28:08.559 --> 00:28:09.830 align:start position:0%
rsas that may or may not apply
but

00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
so so but i i think you're raising a
 
00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:14.320 align:start position:0%
point which is that
 
00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:16.480 align:start position:0%
which is perhaps worth considering in
 
00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
the discussion of whether to broaden
 
00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
this to physical abuse is that you know
 
00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
the legislature has has made certain uh
 
00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
changes to statutes limitations for
 
00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
sexual abuse that it has not done for
 
00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
physical abuse and i think that that at
 
00:28:32.149 --> 00:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
least reflects a a prior policy
 
00:28:32.159 --> 00:28:33.350 align:start position:0%
least reflects a a prior policy
recognition

00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
recognition
 
00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
that that sexual abuse is something that
 
00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:36.870 align:start position:0%
that that sexual abuse is something that
um

00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:38.240 align:start position:0%
that we want to take an even more
 
00:28:39.909 --> 00:28:39.919 align:start position:0%
serious look at again not saying
 
00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
physical abuse is a good thing or okay
 
00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
but sexual abuse is a different category
 
00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:46.640 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for that representative
 
00:28:48.149 --> 00:28:48.159 align:start position:0%
rogers did you have more questions i'm
 
00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:50.240 align:start position:0%
sorry i interrupted you i just wanted to
 
00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
get those in thank you um
 
00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
back to the timeline questions the other
 
00:28:57.269 --> 00:28:57.279 align:start position:0%
um another one is um
 
00:28:59.029 --> 00:28:59.039 align:start position:0%
is the
 
00:29:01.029 --> 00:29:01.039 align:start position:0%
the the whole process is fairly
 
00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
compacted as far as when the hearings
 
00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
and so forth and i'm a little concerned
 
00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
that it's so compacted and i think the
 
00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
same reasoning that expanding the the
 
00:29:13.269 --> 00:29:13.279 align:start position:0%
time that they can claim and so forth i
 
00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
think that and i don't know if this is
 
00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
one of the areas you wanted to address
 
00:29:19.029 --> 00:29:19.039 align:start position:0%
with um plaintiff's counsel as well is
 
00:29:21.029 --> 00:29:21.039 align:start position:0%
maybe broadening that out or losing it a
 
00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:22.640 align:start position:0%
little bit because i worry that
 
00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:24.320 align:start position:0%
everybody can meet all those timelines i
 
00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:26.720 align:start position:0%
mean in a perfect world yes but i think
 
00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:28.640 align:start position:0%
all of us that have practiced
 
00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:31.279 align:start position:0%
in in a corridor in mediation find that
 
00:29:32.789 --> 00:29:32.799 align:start position:0%
make quite often
 
00:29:34.789 --> 00:29:34.799 align:start position:0%
the those type timelines are very
 
00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
constricting so
 
00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
yeah i think it's a great point i think
 
00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
the intent of the drafting was to have
 
00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
flexibility in there you know if you
 
00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
couldn't meet a timeline um but but to
 
00:29:47.029 --> 00:29:47.039 align:start position:0%
your point we want to make sure that
 
00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
that's there because it as you say we
 
00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
can aspire to meet very ambitious
 
00:29:53.669 --> 00:29:53.679 align:start position:0%
timelines and then not meet them
 
00:29:53.679 --> 00:29:54.630 align:start position:0%
timelines and then not meet them
we're

00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:54.640 align:start position:0%
we're
 
00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
part of the compact timelines is really
 
00:29:58.789 --> 00:29:58.799 align:start position:0%
is thinking about the victims and trying
 
00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:00.640 align:start position:0%
you know especially some who if they
 
00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
were harmed many many years ago to move
 
00:30:04.149 --> 00:30:04.159 align:start position:0%
this process quickly i think that's
 
00:30:05.909 --> 00:30:05.919 align:start position:0%
something they want to see but
 
00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:07.360 align:start position:0%
but i think to your point representative
 
00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't want to get so ambitious
 
00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
that we we put people in a tough spot so
 
00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
we'll we're
 
00:30:15.029 --> 00:30:15.039 align:start position:0%
definitely we will take a look at that
 
00:30:15.039 --> 00:30:15.909 align:start position:0%
definitely we will take a look at that
okay

00:30:15.909 --> 00:30:15.919 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:30:15.919 --> 00:30:17.029 align:start position:0%
okay
um

00:30:17.029 --> 00:30:17.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:19.360 align:start position:0%
then i have a question about the next
 
00:30:21.269 --> 00:30:21.279 align:start position:0%
category is the um
 
00:30:22.789 --> 00:30:22.799 align:start position:0%
waiver of rights
 
00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
and there's a number or a few places in
 
00:30:26.389 --> 00:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
there where we talk about
 
00:30:28.789 --> 00:30:28.799 align:start position:0%
um the claimant agrees to the
 
00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
determination of the administrator and
 
00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:32.480 align:start position:0%
the arbitrator is final and binding
 
00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:34.720 align:start position:0%
whether or not any payment is there and
 
00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
then after submitting a claim they waive
 
00:30:38.789 --> 00:30:38.799 align:start position:0%
the right to seek any other
 
00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:40.480 align:start position:0%
monetary relief in any form from the
 
00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
state or its employees
 
00:30:44.389 --> 00:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
um and i know i spoke to you about the
 
00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:46.480 align:start position:0%
one of the employees and such and i
 
00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
understand that most of them aren't
 
00:30:51.269 --> 00:30:51.279 align:start position:0%
going to have a big pocket of funds but
 
00:30:52.549 --> 00:30:52.559 align:start position:0%
as i said when i talked about the
 
00:30:54.789 --> 00:30:54.799 align:start position:0%
statement of purpose to victims quite
 
00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
often it's not the money that's
 
00:30:57.909 --> 00:30:57.919 align:start position:0%
important it's the
 
00:30:57.919 --> 00:30:59.269 align:start position:0%
important it's the
acknowledgement

00:30:59.269 --> 00:30:59.279 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement
 
00:31:01.509 --> 00:31:01.519 align:start position:0%
that there was wrongdoing there so some
 
00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
of them might want to seek in a
 
00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:04.640 align:start position:0%
particularly egregious i mean it's all
 
00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
egregious but a few of them
 
00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:08.320 align:start position:0%
the claimants might want to seek
 
00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:10.640 align:start position:0%
individual action against an employee if
 
00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:11.440 align:start position:0%
it was
 
00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:14.240 align:start position:0%
action like that and i worry that we're
 
00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
cutting them off from doing that by
 
00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
saying they can't do any action about an
 
00:31:20.389 --> 00:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
employee i know there's the it says
 
00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:22.640 align:start position:0%
monetary relief but i just want to make
 
00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
sure that that doesn't constrict them
 
00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
that they can't go forward and file a
 
00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:28.310 align:start position:0%
that they can't go forward and file a
claim

00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
claim
 
00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
um in in civil court if there's
 
00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:32.720 align:start position:0%
something in particular as i said i
 
00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
think they know they're not going to get
 
00:31:36.549 --> 00:31:36.559 align:start position:0%
a large monetary settlement but
 
00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
the acknowledgement that that particular
 
00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:39.190 align:start position:0%
the acknowledgement that that particular
individual

00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:39.200 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:40.230 align:start position:0%
individual
um

00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:40.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
did something to them and i know we were
 
00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
pursuing criminal but there's also that
 
00:31:46.789 --> 00:31:46.799 align:start position:0%
extra thing yeah we can absolutely look
 
00:31:46.799 --> 00:31:47.430 align:start position:0%
extra thing yeah we can absolutely look
at

00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:47.440 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
look at that i think the intent
 
00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
right is to is to
 
00:31:54.149 --> 00:31:54.159 align:start position:0%
to sort of say you're waving additional
 
00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
claims against the state to say this is
 
00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
what the state's going to pay you but as
 
00:31:59.909 --> 00:31:59.919 align:start position:0%
far as yeah the employees themselves we
 
00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
can definitely take a look at that
 
00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
and i think to your point i kind of hit
 
00:32:05.509 --> 00:32:05.519 align:start position:0%
it last week some employees we will
 
00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
pursue criminally there will be others
 
00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
who are their allegations against and
 
00:32:11.509 --> 00:32:11.519 align:start position:0%
because these cases are so old it's very
 
00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
tough to build cases that you think you
 
00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
can prove beyond a reasonable doubt so
 
00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
there will be there will certainly be in
 
00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:20.320 align:start position:0%
former employees who allegations have
 
00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
been made against that we will not be
 
00:32:24.149 --> 00:32:24.159 align:start position:0%
able to pursue okay criminally i
 
00:32:26.389 --> 00:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
understand and um and kind of the last
 
00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
thing when i talked about the um
 
00:32:31.509 --> 00:32:31.519 align:start position:0%
back in the timeline and the whole thing
 
00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
is the notice and if the notice is
 
00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
adequate as far as just and i think this
 
00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
was brought up in some testimony that
 
00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:39.750 align:start position:0%
was brought up in some testimony that
day

00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
day
 
00:32:41.909 --> 00:32:41.919 align:start position:0%
using newspapers and so forth as i think
 
00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
i said earlier because of the nature of
 
00:32:46.149 --> 00:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
this there's a possibility that some of
 
00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:47.440 align:start position:0%
these folks might be in penal
 
00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:48.950 align:start position:0%
these folks might be in penal
institutions

00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
institutions
 
00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
um having graduated shall we say from
 
00:32:54.549 --> 00:32:54.559 align:start position:0%
from this level um so i think that that
 
00:32:56.950 --> 00:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
the notice needs to be stretched out a
 
00:32:58.630 --> 00:32:58.640 align:start position:0%
little bit more and to maybe look at
 
00:33:01.269 --> 00:33:01.279 align:start position:0%
that fact that where would these victims
 
00:33:03.029 --> 00:33:03.039 align:start position:0%
be at to be not all of them are going to
 
00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:05.440 align:start position:0%
be reading the newspapers to know about
 
00:33:07.029 --> 00:33:07.039 align:start position:0%
it although we all think it's in the
 
00:33:08.950 --> 00:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
news we should know
 
00:33:10.549 --> 00:33:10.559 align:start position:0%
many of them because of the nature of
 
00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
what they've been through
 
00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
aren't going to be doing that so i think
 
00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
that that needs to be broadened a little
 
00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
bit from just the public media and if
 
00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
there's ways to do it
 
00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
um i'm sure you can figure it out but
 
00:33:25.909 --> 00:33:25.919 align:start position:0%
i'm just worried it's too constricting
 
00:33:27.669 --> 00:33:27.679 align:start position:0%
again yeah we can absolutely take a look
 
00:33:29.509 --> 00:33:29.519 align:start position:0%
at that did you have a comment on that
 
00:33:29.519 --> 00:33:35.590 align:start position:0%
at that did you have a comment on that
um

00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:37.909 --> 00:33:37.919 align:start position:0%
if that's for the record could you speak
 
00:33:40.149 --> 00:33:40.159 align:start position:0%
into the mic i'm i'm searching this is
 
00:33:42.789 --> 00:33:42.799 align:start position:0%
this is being recorded i believe uh it's
 
00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
being broadcast i also think it's being
 
00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:46.149 align:start position:0%
being broadcast i also think it's being
recorded

00:33:46.149 --> 00:33:46.159 align:start position:0%
recorded
 
00:33:48.789 --> 00:33:48.799 align:start position:0%
mr ripple is is the recording of this
 
00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
also going to be online for a while all
 
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.350 align:start position:0%
also going to be online for a while all
right

00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
i was saying to the attorney general i
 
00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:56.720 align:start position:0%
believe that this draft contains
 
00:33:58.470 --> 00:33:58.480 align:start position:0%
language that we would also post it at
 
00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
the at the department of corrections
 
00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
that the process was going on
 
00:34:04.789 --> 00:34:04.799 align:start position:0%
um if it doesn't we can certainly add
 
00:34:04.799 --> 00:34:06.070 align:start position:0%
um if it doesn't we can certainly add
that

00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:08.240 align:start position:0%
and i also heard a comment last time
 
00:34:09.990 --> 00:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
about the possibility that we might want
 
00:34:11.669 --> 00:34:11.679 align:start position:0%
to publish
 
00:34:13.109 --> 00:34:13.119 align:start position:0%
on a broader scale than just within the
 
00:34:14.629 --> 00:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire and that was also
 
00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:16.720 align:start position:0%
something that i had in my notes to to
 
00:34:18.829 --> 00:34:18.839 align:start position:0%
contemplate as we work through this next
 
00:34:22.629 --> 00:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
week thank you so i assume on the notice
 
00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:24.800 align:start position:0%
that's fairly well established to what
 
00:34:28.389 --> 00:34:28.399 align:start position:0%
constitutes legal notice and and so
 
00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
i i would just expect we would follow
 
00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:31.349 align:start position:0%
i i would just expect we would follow
the

00:34:31.349 --> 00:34:31.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
standard practice are you proposing that
 
00:34:35.349 --> 00:34:35.359 align:start position:0%
we want to take the standard notice
 
00:34:38.069 --> 00:34:38.079 align:start position:0%
practice and expand beyond that
 
00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
that would be my suggestion because with
 
00:34:42.629 --> 00:34:42.639 align:start position:0%
this case is is
 
00:34:44.869 --> 00:34:44.879 align:start position:0%
different than what we usually do
 
00:34:46.629 --> 00:34:46.639 align:start position:0%
and we are talking
 
00:34:48.629 --> 00:34:48.639 align:start position:0%
a number of potential victims and a
 
00:34:50.950 --> 00:34:50.960 align:start position:0%
large amount of money i think expanding
 
00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
it to suit
 
00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
um the nature of the victims here i
 
00:34:55.909 --> 00:34:55.919 align:start position:0%
think it needs to be expanded a little
 
00:34:57.430 --> 00:34:57.440 align:start position:0%
bit and i'm not talking about legal
 
00:34:59.589 --> 00:34:59.599 align:start position:0%
notice i know we can we can fit those
 
00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
bars but i'm talking about getting it
 
00:35:03.109 --> 00:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
out so that people can know about it a
 
00:35:05.109 --> 00:35:05.119 align:start position:0%
little further than what what we propose
 
00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
but i think the department of
 
00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
corrections is is a good start and i
 
00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:11.200 align:start position:0%
think just pursuing it from there
 
00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
thoughts mr attorney general
 
00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
yeah i think it would make sense to go
 
00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
go beyond necessarily what we would
 
00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
typically consider to be adequate legal
 
00:35:23.109 --> 00:35:23.119 align:start position:0%
notice because i
 
00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
that that many times is not a very high
 
00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
bar and so if we're if we're really
 
00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:29.200 align:start position:0%
trying to make a proactive effort to
 
00:35:31.589 --> 00:35:31.599 align:start position:0%
make sure the relevant population knows
 
00:35:33.349 --> 00:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
about this i think it would make sense
 
00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:35.440 align:start position:0%
obviously there are there are reasonable
 
00:35:37.270 --> 00:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
limits to that but i think looking for
 
00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:38.630 align:start position:0%
limits to that but i think looking for
opportunities

00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:38.640 align:start position:0%
opportunities
 
00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
um through which we can go above and
 
00:35:42.069 --> 00:35:42.079 align:start position:0%
beyond what typically would be adequate
 
00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
legal notice makes sense in this case
 
00:35:45.349 --> 00:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
so i want to i want to leverage off of
 
00:35:49.109 --> 00:35:49.119 align:start position:0%
something representative rogers and you
 
00:35:51.109 --> 00:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
were talking about earlier
 
00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:54.160 align:start position:0%
you you mentioned that um
 
00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:56.069 align:start position:0%
you you mentioned that um
employees

00:35:56.069 --> 00:35:56.079 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:35:58.550 --> 00:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
during an investigation there may be
 
00:36:01.589 --> 00:36:01.599 align:start position:0%
some indication that they've violated a
 
00:36:04.069 --> 00:36:04.079 align:start position:0%
law along the way and that they might
 
00:36:07.349 --> 00:36:07.359 align:start position:0%
also be subject to criminal referral if
 
00:36:10.829 --> 00:36:10.839 align:start position:0%
you know depending on the facts and
 
00:36:13.589 --> 00:36:13.599 align:start position:0%
circumstances yeah just to clarify
 
00:36:15.109 --> 00:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
representative i i was thinking
 
00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
specifically of the employees who were
 
00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
alleged to have committed the abuse no
 
00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:19.270 align:start position:0%
alleged to have committed the abuse no
we're

00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
we're
 
00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
okay that's what i mean okay
 
00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
yes that we we currently have indicted
 
00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:26.069 align:start position:0%
yes that we we currently have indicted
11

00:36:26.069 --> 00:36:26.079 align:start position:0%
11
 
00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
individuals who are former employees we
 
00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:29.750 align:start position:0%
individuals who are former employees we
expect

00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
expect
 
00:36:32.069 --> 00:36:32.079 align:start position:0%
that there will potentially be more
 
00:36:35.109 --> 00:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
so can i share my thought on that sure
 
00:36:35.119 --> 00:36:37.829 align:start position:0%
so can i share my thought on that sure
um

00:36:37.829 --> 00:36:37.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
we specifically say that
 
00:36:43.589 --> 00:36:43.599 align:start position:0%
the claims shall be submitted under oath
 
00:36:45.109 --> 00:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
and the claimants who are believed to
 
00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:47.200 align:start position:0%
have submitted false claims may be
 
00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
referred to
 
00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:52.640 align:start position:0%
okay so so should we have sort of mere
 
00:36:57.910 --> 00:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
language that says employees who are
 
00:37:01.109 --> 00:37:01.119 align:start position:0%
suspected of violating laws shall also
 
00:37:03.589 --> 00:37:03.599 align:start position:0%
be referred to appropriate
 
00:37:05.109 --> 00:37:05.119 align:start position:0%
law enforcement
 
00:37:07.349 --> 00:37:07.359 align:start position:0%
because because it's silent on that but
 
00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:09.440 align:start position:0%
you just said that we've already
 
00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
indicted or you know arrested 11.
 
00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
so i'm just for for fairness just trying
 
00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
to get the balance that we're going to
 
00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:21.200 align:start position:0%
treat nerdy well employees
 
00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
appropriately yeah and we we would i
 
00:37:27.109 --> 00:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
i can explain why that specific
 
00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
provision is in there we we have had one
 
00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
one former resident of of ydc or at
 
00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
least one former person who claimed to
 
00:37:38.069 --> 00:37:38.079 align:start position:0%
be a resident of ydc yes yes sir let me
 
00:37:39.589 --> 00:37:39.599 align:start position:0%
let me cut you off there because i think
 
00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to be agreeing on what
 
00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:42.720 align:start position:0%
you're about to say yep
 
00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
i'm actually talking about the flip side
 
00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
i'm talking about adding a sentence to
 
00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:49.280 align:start position:0%
say that the employee
 
00:37:51.349 --> 00:37:51.359 align:start position:0%
could be subject to penalties
 
00:37:53.910 --> 00:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
we say clem claimants can be subjected
 
00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
to employees but we don't say anything
 
00:37:58.150 --> 00:37:58.160 align:start position:0%
about the employees so
 
00:38:00.310 --> 00:38:00.320 align:start position:0%
i think ms ramsey understands what i'm
 
00:38:02.069 --> 00:38:02.079 align:start position:0%
saying no i i understand what you're
 
00:38:02.079 --> 00:38:02.870 align:start position:0%
saying no i i understand what you're
saying

00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
saying
 
00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
and i'm fine with that i think the point
 
00:38:07.349 --> 00:38:07.359 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to make is that
 
00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
i don't think anyone would without we
 
00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
don't have to do anything to make make
 
00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
an employee or a
 
00:38:17.829 --> 00:38:17.839 align:start position:0%
former victim who gives false statements
 
00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
potentially subject to criminal
 
00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
penalties i think employees generally
 
00:38:23.829 --> 00:38:23.839 align:start position:0%
know that that will be the case and i
 
00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
think part of the intent here was to
 
00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:27.280 align:start position:0%
make clear that
 
00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
if if someone submits a claim it's under
 
00:38:31.109 --> 00:38:31.119 align:start position:0%
oath it's false that they could be
 
00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:33.440 align:start position:0%
referred for prosecution but i think it
 
00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
would be fine to to have that in there
 
00:38:37.589 --> 00:38:37.599 align:start position:0%
just to your point so that there's no
 
00:38:37.599 --> 00:38:40.470 align:start position:0%
just to your point so that there's no
confusion

00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:41.270 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
representative rogers are you done i'm
 
00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
done thank you very much all right if
 
00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
you have anything else let me know um
 
00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
are there any
 
00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:54.880 align:start position:0%
other questions by the committee
 
00:38:56.870 --> 00:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh representation
 
00:38:58.950 --> 00:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:39:00.950 --> 00:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
nice to see you both today and thanks
 
00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:05.680 align:start position:0%
as far as the appropriation the 100
 
00:39:07.349 --> 00:39:07.359 align:start position:0%
million dollars in reading the
 
00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
legislation i see that's to
 
00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
also cover your expenses such as the
 
00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
investigator the administrator
 
00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
how much of an impact is this going to
 
00:39:19.829 --> 00:39:19.839 align:start position:0%
have on your agency and
 
00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
is that 100 million dollars it sounds
 
00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
like a significant amount of money which
 
00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
it is but
 
00:39:27.349 --> 00:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
is there enough money there between the
 
00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:30.160 align:start position:0%
settlement and the administration of
 
00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:31.349 align:start position:0%
settlement and the administration of
this

00:39:31.349 --> 00:39:31.359 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
if you will uh mess i i assume that you
 
00:39:37.349 --> 00:39:37.359 align:start position:0%
may need additional outside counsel and
 
00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
so forth
 
00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
yeah it's it's a great question
 
00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:44.960 align:start position:0%
representative i think that
 
00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
i don't know i know that's not the
 
00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
greatest answer i i can't tell you as we
 
00:39:51.109 --> 00:39:51.119 align:start position:0%
sit here today whether it will be enough
 
00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
enough to cover
 
00:39:55.109 --> 00:39:55.119 align:start position:0%
all of the claims that come in and all
 
00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:56.720 align:start position:0%
of the additional administrative
 
00:39:59.030 --> 00:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
expenses we were to incur
 
00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
as the department of justice to
 
00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:02.240 align:start position:0%
administer all of this
 
00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
i think this this represents our our
 
00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
best initial estimate as a number that
 
00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
could cover it
 
00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:10.720 align:start position:0%
i we would make every attempt to keep
 
00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
our administrative expenses as
 
00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
associated with this as low as possible
 
00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:17.200 align:start position:0%
so that as much of this money
 
00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:20.800 align:start position:0%
is going to claims as possible but i
 
00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:22.720 align:start position:0%
i think there's i think the best answer
 
00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
i give that there's a possibility it may
 
00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
not be enough i think we won't
 
00:40:29.670 --> 00:40:29.680 align:start position:0%
have a great sense of that until we or
 
00:40:31.829 --> 00:40:31.839 align:start position:0%
we won't we won't start to know that for
 
00:40:31.839 --> 00:40:32.630 align:start position:0%
we won't we won't start to know that for
sure

00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:40:35.190 --> 00:40:35.200 align:start position:0%
until we see all of the claims that that
 
00:40:37.109 --> 00:40:37.119 align:start position:0%
come in and we get a real sense of how
 
00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:38.720 align:start position:0%
many folks are participating in this
 
00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
process because that that will affect
 
00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
not only the amount we pay out in claims
 
00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
it will affect how much it costs
 
00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:46.720 align:start position:0%
to have
 
00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:48.640 align:start position:0%
to to administer it
 
00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
i can tell you though i think we will
 
00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:52.240 align:start position:0%
spend a lot less money from a department
 
00:40:54.069 --> 00:40:54.079 align:start position:0%
of justice perspective on this than we
 
00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
would spend on defending all of these
 
00:40:58.309 --> 00:40:58.319 align:start position:0%
cases in court
 
00:41:02.069 --> 00:41:02.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:05.109 --> 00:41:05.119 align:start position:0%
so should should the legislature
 
00:41:07.349 --> 00:41:07.359 align:start position:0%
be confident
 
00:41:07.359 --> 00:41:08.309 align:start position:0%
be confident
that

00:41:08.309 --> 00:41:08.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
all of the accounting codes will get set
 
00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
up within this fund
 
00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
so that we can clearly differentiate and
 
00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
potentially audit
 
00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
the money spent for the bureaucracy
 
00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
versus and i say that in a positive
 
00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
loving way yeah yeah the doj bureaucracy
 
00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
versus uh claimants yes if if some if we
 
00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
were to enact this bill or
 
00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:33.430 align:start position:0%
were to enact this bill or
or

00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:33.440 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:41:36.309 --> 00:41:36.319 align:start position:0%
a version of this bill you could be 100
 
00:41:38.710 --> 00:41:38.720 align:start position:0%
confident of that because i think
 
00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
you know while the primary goal of this
 
00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
is to
 
00:41:44.069 --> 00:41:44.079 align:start position:0%
is to
 
00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:46.640 align:start position:0%
compensate victims and and
 
00:41:48.309 --> 00:41:48.319 align:start position:0%
repair some of the damage that's been
 
00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
done when when we're talking about any
 
00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
taxpayer funds but particularly taxpayer
 
00:41:53.589 --> 00:41:53.599 align:start position:0%
funds of this amount that type of
 
00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
accounting and making sure there's
 
00:41:57.109 --> 00:41:57.119 align:start position:0%
transparency and the ability to go back
 
00:41:59.030 --> 00:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
in audit to make sure we can keep an eye
 
00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:00.400 align:start position:0%
on how the money's being spent i think
 
00:42:02.069 --> 00:42:02.079 align:start position:0%
that's critical so i think you can
 
00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
absolutely be confident of that
 
00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:06.720 align:start position:0%
okay so so uh representative umberger
 
00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
has a question for you you want to use
 
00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
the mic ma'am
 
00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
i just want to make sure that
 
00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
are you suggesting
 
00:42:27.829 --> 00:42:27.839 align:start position:0%
that the 100 million will only cover
 
00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:29.440 align:start position:0%
this process
 
00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:32.480 align:start position:0%
or will that include
 
00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:33.990 align:start position:0%
or will that include
um

00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:36.720 align:start position:0%
people that choose to go to court for
 
00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:39.510 align:start position:0%
people that choose to go to court for
settlement

00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:40.309 align:start position:0%
 
i

00:42:40.309 --> 00:42:40.319 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:42:44.069 --> 00:42:44.079 align:start position:0%
in my mind 100 million is intended to
 
00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
to only cover this process but that's
 
00:42:49.349 --> 00:42:49.359 align:start position:0%
that's because i think that the goal of
 
00:42:51.349 --> 00:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
this is to have just about everyone come
 
00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
through this process
 
00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
if if
 
00:42:57.750 --> 00:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
only half do and half go to court
 
00:42:59.190 --> 00:42:59.200 align:start position:0%
you know what
 
00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
what what i could see happening is that
 
00:43:04.069 --> 00:43:04.079 align:start position:0%
we don't spend anywhere close to the 100
 
00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
million on this process and at that
 
00:43:08.069 --> 00:43:08.079 align:start position:0%
point we may come back to the
 
00:43:10.309 --> 00:43:10.319 align:start position:0%
legislature and recommend that
 
00:43:12.550 --> 00:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
some part of this money be because it
 
00:43:14.550 --> 00:43:14.560 align:start position:0%
won't be needed for this settlement
 
00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
process be used
 
00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
for litigation in court
 
00:43:21.109 --> 00:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question thank you
 
00:43:21.119 --> 00:43:25.030 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question thank you
okay

00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:28.240 align:start position:0%
uh i i'm sorry i don't see your name
 
00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:43:32.309 --> 00:43:32.319 align:start position:0%
i hate to belabor this but last week we
 
00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:34.480 align:start position:0%
heard testimony from
 
00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
an attorney that has 441
 
00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:39.510 align:start position:0%
an attorney that has 441
individuals

00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
that will be part of a suit
 
00:43:43.349 --> 00:43:43.359 align:start position:0%
and giving that number and giving the
 
00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
100 million and giving the
 
00:43:49.589 --> 00:43:49.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
this is finance the math isn't working
 
00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:54.640 align:start position:0%
for me with 100 million i i mean i
 
00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:55.510 align:start position:0%
for me with 100 million i i mean i
certainly

00:43:55.510 --> 00:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
00:43:57.670 --> 00:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
appreciate and encourage to be
 
00:43:59.750 --> 00:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
conservative on the front end of
 
00:44:01.270 --> 00:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
something but
 
00:44:03.109 --> 00:44:03.119 align:start position:0%
given this circumstance i think we'd be
 
00:44:06.630 --> 00:44:06.640 align:start position:0%
better served if we had as
 
00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:09.200 align:start position:0%
i don't even know if it's possible uh uh
 
00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
as a realistic as possible number to
 
00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
start with does that am i making sense
 
00:44:16.390 --> 00:44:16.400 align:start position:0%
i'm just concerned that
 
00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:18.400 align:start position:0%
maybe we're a little too low on the bar
 
00:44:20.550 --> 00:44:20.560 align:start position:0%
or is that is there a purpose for that
 
00:44:23.109 --> 00:44:23.119 align:start position:0%
that's all thank you thank you mr chair
 
00:44:24.309 --> 00:44:24.319 align:start position:0%
yeah it's it's a really good question
 
00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
representative and trust me we i we
 
00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
we've wrestled with that there there's a
 
00:44:31.589 --> 00:44:31.599 align:start position:0%
couple of pieces of this to keep in mind
 
00:44:35.750 --> 00:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
again there's there's a difficulty in
 
00:44:39.349 --> 00:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
predicting how many will come through
 
00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
the process there
 
00:44:43.030 --> 00:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
i think we have to allow for the
 
00:44:44.790 --> 00:44:44.800 align:start position:0%
possibility that there will be some
 
00:44:46.309 --> 00:44:46.319 align:start position:0%
folks who might come through the process
 
00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
and get very little if no money because
 
00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
we part of this is designed to to be a
 
00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
claims verification process and when we
 
00:44:57.670 --> 00:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
actually are able to
 
00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:00.160 align:start position:0%
take a look at what some folks might be
 
00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:01.430 align:start position:0%
take a look at what some folks might be
saying

00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
saying
 
00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
or take a look at the events some folks
 
00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:06.160 align:start position:0%
might be saying happened we may find
 
00:45:07.829 --> 00:45:07.839 align:start position:0%
that there's just no information there's
 
00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
just no information that verifies that
 
00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
the records don't support it the records
 
00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
don't support the dates or anywhere
 
00:45:14.309 --> 00:45:14.319 align:start position:0%
close to the dates
 
00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
and so it's just
 
00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
until we have a chance to start looking
 
00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:20.240 align:start position:0%
at that it's it's difficult but but i
 
00:45:22.069 --> 00:45:22.079 align:start position:0%
think you're raising a point which is a
 
00:45:24.390 --> 00:45:24.400 align:start position:0%
good one that you know we should not
 
00:45:27.430 --> 00:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
assume this hundred million will be it
 
00:45:28.870 --> 00:45:28.880 align:start position:0%
and enough
 
00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:29.990 align:start position:0%
and enough
but

00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:45:31.589 --> 00:45:31.599 align:start position:0%
because we've set it up in such a way
 
00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:34.480 align:start position:0%
that claims can be paid over time
 
00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:35.270 align:start position:0%
that claims can be paid over time
that

00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:36.550 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:45:36.550 --> 00:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
that there is a there's a claims
 
00:45:40.069 --> 00:45:40.079 align:start position:0%
verification process we don't know how
 
00:45:42.630 --> 00:45:42.640 align:start position:0%
many will come through i i feel fairly
 
00:45:44.230 --> 00:45:44.240 align:start position:0%
confident saying a hundred million will
 
00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:57.589 --> 00:45:57.599 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't think you're on
 
00:46:01.589 --> 00:46:01.599 align:start position:0%
how about now yes okay um if so there's
 
00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
a waiver process in here and i'm trying
 
00:46:05.430 --> 00:46:05.440 align:start position:0%
to figure out when the waiver happens
 
00:46:07.589 --> 00:46:07.599 align:start position:0%
so you just suggested that some claimant
 
00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
may come in
 
00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
and there may not be enough evidence for
 
00:46:13.750 --> 00:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
you to conclude with the evidence you
 
00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
have available that you can prove how
 
00:46:19.750 --> 00:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
that claimant was victimized
 
00:46:21.910 --> 00:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
but if that claimant has to waive their
 
00:46:24.630 --> 00:46:24.640 align:start position:0%
rights to even get you guys that far
 
00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:26.640 align:start position:0%
that means that that claimant then if
 
00:46:27.829 --> 00:46:27.839 align:start position:0%
i'm understanding the scroll he will
 
00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
then not have the opportunity to go out
 
00:46:32.230 --> 00:46:32.240 align:start position:0%
and hire a lawyer on his own and try and
 
00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
prove it independently of what the state
 
00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
is bringing forward on evidence am i
 
00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
correct as to when the waiver happens
 
00:46:40.870 --> 00:46:40.880 align:start position:0%
that they have to wait sign the waiver
 
00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
only to have you guys say oh we we can't
 
00:46:45.190 --> 00:46:45.200 align:start position:0%
find enough evidence and then
 
00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:47.200 align:start position:0%
effectively deny them
 
00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:48.880 align:start position:0%
the real bite at the apple by going to
 
00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:49.910 align:start position:0%
the real bite at the apple by going to
court

00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
court
 
00:46:50.950 --> 00:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
well so
 
00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
yeah at least as the bills drafted now
 
00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
the waiver happens at the at the
 
00:46:55.670 --> 00:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
beginning of the process so when they
 
00:46:57.589 --> 00:46:57.599 align:start position:0%
enter the process
 
00:46:59.109 --> 00:46:59.119 align:start position:0%
but if
 
00:47:02.150 --> 00:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
the the process also provides that if if
 
00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
there's a disagreement between the
 
00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:05.680 align:start position:0%
administrator which would be
 
00:47:07.829 --> 00:47:07.839 align:start position:0%
at least as the bill's drafted now a
 
00:47:09.510 --> 00:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
designee of the attorney general if
 
00:47:11.109 --> 00:47:11.119 align:start position:0%
there's a disagreement between the
 
00:47:13.109 --> 00:47:13.119 align:start position:0%
administrator and
 
00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
and the victim then it can go to
 
00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
arbitration in front of an independent
 
00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:18.069 align:start position:0%
arbitration in front of an independent
arbitrator

00:47:18.069 --> 00:47:18.079 align:start position:0%
arbitrator
 
00:47:19.990 --> 00:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
so after all of the i mean
 
00:47:21.910 --> 00:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
after all of that
 
00:47:25.109 --> 00:47:25.119 align:start position:0%
if they go through the process they
 
00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
the administrator doesn't feel there's
 
00:47:28.309 --> 00:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
enough there to justify a claim and then
 
00:47:30.309 --> 00:47:30.319 align:start position:0%
it goes to arbitration the arbitrator
 
00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:32.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't feel there's enough there
 
00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:34.400 align:start position:0%
i guess to answer your question yes
 
00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
they it's a possible that there may not
 
00:47:40.069 --> 00:47:40.079 align:start position:0%
be much if any compensation and yes they
 
00:47:41.510 --> 00:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
will have waived their rights to go to
 
00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:42.549 align:start position:0%
will have waived their rights to go to
court

00:47:42.549 --> 00:47:42.559 align:start position:0%
court
 
00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:44.640 align:start position:0%
but but i think the reality is that if
 
00:47:46.710 --> 00:47:46.720 align:start position:0%
that were to happen it means that if
 
00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:47.750 align:start position:0%
that were to happen it means that if
they

00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
then decided to go to court the chances
 
00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
of being able to recover anything would
 
00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:53.190 align:start position:0%
of being able to recover anything would
would

00:47:53.190 --> 00:47:53.200 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:47:55.190 --> 00:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
be close to non-existent
 
00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:56.230 align:start position:0%
be close to non-existent
would

00:47:56.230 --> 00:47:56.240 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:47:57.510 --> 00:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:47:59.750 --> 00:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
would that victim be represented by
 
00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:02.720 align:start position:0%
council at the mediation level
 
00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
so that i mean because depending on how
 
00:48:06.549 --> 00:48:06.559 align:start position:0%
when council is in there and the role of
 
00:48:08.870 --> 00:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
council would make a huge difference in
 
00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
their ability to to prove or to show
 
00:48:13.510 --> 00:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
their claim yep yeah no the victim would
 
00:48:16.309 --> 00:48:16.319 align:start position:0%
be represented and i don't or at least i
 
00:48:16.319 --> 00:48:17.589 align:start position:0%
be represented and i don't or at least i
i

00:48:17.589 --> 00:48:17.599 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:48:19.589 --> 00:48:19.599 align:start position:0%
given that we have 440 who are
 
00:48:21.430 --> 00:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
represented and i would imagine anyone
 
00:48:22.790 --> 00:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
who comes through this process would be
 
00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:24.309 align:start position:0%
who comes through this process would be
represented

00:48:24.309 --> 00:48:24.319 align:start position:0%
represented
 
00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
so so i think the answer that is yes i
 
00:48:27.990 --> 00:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
also just want to clarify you know i'm
 
00:48:30.710 --> 00:48:30.720 align:start position:0%
not suggesting that i that i think there
 
00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:32.640 align:start position:0%
will be
 
00:48:34.069 --> 00:48:34.079 align:start position:0%
vic you know victims who come through
 
00:48:36.069 --> 00:48:36.079 align:start position:0%
who don't get compensation i'm really
 
00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
only suggesting that we don't know for
 
00:48:41.349 --> 00:48:41.359 align:start position:0%
sure we when we when we we just have to
 
00:48:43.109 --> 00:48:43.119 align:start position:0%
allow for that possibility and that's
 
00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
one of the possibilities that was baked
 
00:48:48.549 --> 00:48:48.559 align:start position:0%
into other factors that led us to the to
 
00:48:50.309 --> 00:48:50.319 align:start position:0%
the to an estimate of a hundred million
 
00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
dollars at least a best estimate of that
 
00:48:55.589 --> 00:48:55.599 align:start position:0%
number for for the moment as we sit here
 
00:48:57.990 --> 00:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
at a very early stage of this
 
00:49:00.390 --> 00:49:00.400 align:start position:0%
will there be discovery available to the
 
00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:06.549 align:start position:0%
will there be discovery available to the
claimants

00:49:06.549 --> 00:49:06.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:06.559 --> 00:49:08.470 align:start position:0%
 
i

00:49:08.470 --> 00:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:09.349 align:start position:0%
i
i

00:49:09.349 --> 00:49:09.359 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:49:10.470 --> 00:49:10.480 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:49:12.870 --> 00:49:12.880 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna answer your question this way
 
00:49:14.309 --> 00:49:14.319 align:start position:0%
you know what we're looking to do here
 
00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
is to to verify a claim so it's not
 
00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:20.720 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be an an adversarial
 
00:49:22.549 --> 00:49:22.559 align:start position:0%
process i think that
 
00:49:23.829 --> 00:49:23.839 align:start position:0%
we will
 
00:49:23.839 --> 00:49:25.109 align:start position:0%
we will
be

00:49:25.109 --> 00:49:25.119 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:26.720 align:start position:0%
they will have access to any information
 
00:49:28.549 --> 00:49:28.559 align:start position:0%
that we have access to that might lead
 
00:49:31.510 --> 00:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
us to say we don't think
 
00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:32.470 align:start position:0%
us to say we don't think
um

00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:34.309 --> 00:49:34.319 align:start position:0%
this claim should be paid
 
00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
but i
 
00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:36.950 align:start position:0%
but i
but

00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:39.680 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't have access to discovery
 
00:49:42.549 --> 00:49:42.559 align:start position:0%
in the traditional sense
 
00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:44.480 align:start position:0%
or the process wouldn't work that way
 
00:49:46.470 --> 00:49:46.480 align:start position:0%
because it's not it's not going to be an
 
00:49:49.510 --> 00:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
adversarial process so we're all we're
 
00:49:51.430 --> 00:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
only we're going to look at
 
00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:52.710 align:start position:0%
only we're going to look at
um

00:49:52.710 --> 00:49:52.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:54.870 --> 00:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
the best information we have they'll
 
00:49:56.549 --> 00:49:56.559 align:start position:0%
they'll get access to that information
 
00:49:58.950 --> 00:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
if they ask for something we will
 
00:50:01.109 --> 00:50:01.119 align:start position:0%
we will give it to them if we have it
 
00:50:04.390 --> 00:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
you know it's not um so
 
00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:05.200 align:start position:0%
so i
 
00:50:06.390 --> 00:50:06.400 align:start position:0%
i think the best way to answer your
 
00:50:09.270 --> 00:50:09.280 align:start position:0%
question is sort of twofold
 
00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't think of it as discovery
 
00:50:11.910 --> 00:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
because it's going to be more of a
 
00:50:13.349 --> 00:50:13.359 align:start position:0%
claims verification process than an
 
00:50:15.990 --> 00:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
adversarial adversarial process but to
 
00:50:18.309 --> 00:50:18.319 align:start position:0%
the extent there's a discovery analogy
 
00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:20.720 align:start position:0%
in this process yes they will they will
 
00:50:22.710 --> 00:50:22.720 align:start position:0%
they will get discovery but it wouldn't
 
00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:24.800 align:start position:0%
work quite the same way as discovery and
 
00:50:27.109 --> 00:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
in the traditional litigation sense
 
00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
one more question
 
00:50:31.109 --> 00:50:31.119 align:start position:0%
is it a follow-up to what you just asked
 
00:50:32.549 --> 00:50:32.559 align:start position:0%
because i want to follow up to what you
 
00:50:34.390 --> 00:50:34.400 align:start position:0%
just asked well this is going to be real
 
00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:36.720 align:start position:0%
quick if you don't mind and that is does
 
00:50:39.109 --> 00:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
the is there anything in this bill that
 
00:50:41.109 --> 00:50:41.119 align:start position:0%
caps recovery at the 100 million that
 
00:50:43.109 --> 00:50:43.119 align:start position:0%
we're doing or say that we end up with
 
00:50:45.270 --> 00:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
300 million in claims can we still
 
00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
proceed with 300 million in claims
 
00:50:49.589 --> 00:50:49.599 align:start position:0%
yes we could still proceed with 300
 
00:50:51.670 --> 00:50:51.680 align:start position:0%
million in claims the legislature would
 
00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
need to appropriate additional funds but
 
00:50:56.069 --> 00:50:56.079 align:start position:0%
yeah there's nothing in here that's
 
00:50:59.910 --> 00:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
intended to have this be a cap it just
 
00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
the it just isn't an open-ended
 
00:51:03.670 --> 00:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
appropriation which i know i think the
 
00:51:05.190 --> 00:51:05.200 align:start position:0%
legislature generally doesn't like but
 
00:51:08.470 --> 00:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
it's it's uh i think it contemplates
 
00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
potential additional appropriations down
 
00:51:12.309 --> 00:51:12.319 align:start position:0%
the line i think it explicitly says the
 
00:51:13.990 --> 00:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
administrator can ask for additional
 
00:51:16.710 --> 00:51:16.720 align:start position:0%
money as needed so it's in there right
 
00:51:18.069 --> 00:51:18.079 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:51:21.270 --> 00:51:21.280 align:start position:0%
as you were talking about uh sort of the
 
00:51:23.109 --> 00:51:23.119 align:start position:0%
you know modified
 
00:51:25.109 --> 00:51:25.119 align:start position:0%
discovery procedures that you're going
 
00:51:28.069 --> 00:51:28.079 align:start position:0%
to use i don't recall reading anything
 
00:51:30.309 --> 00:51:30.319 align:start position:0%
about the
 
00:51:32.710 --> 00:51:32.720 align:start position:0%
claimant's ability to
 
00:51:35.910 --> 00:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
make inquiries about state records to
 
00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
help them fulfill
 
00:51:39.510 --> 00:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
their claims
 
00:51:42.150 --> 00:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
and and it and it sounds like
 
00:51:44.470 --> 00:51:44.480 align:start position:0%
um something that you expect and you
 
00:51:46.790 --> 00:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
believe to be rational and so makes me
 
00:51:50.230 --> 00:51:50.240 align:start position:0%
wonder if if that a sentence or two
 
00:51:52.390 --> 00:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
should be added into an amendment to
 
00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:53.670 align:start position:0%
should be added into an amendment to
clarify

00:51:53.670 --> 00:51:53.680 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
00:51:55.829 --> 00:51:55.839 align:start position:0%
the claimant's ability to request state
 
00:51:55.839 --> 00:51:56.950 align:start position:0%
the claimant's ability to request state
records

00:51:56.950 --> 00:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
records
 
00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
so independently of this bill um
 
00:52:01.750 --> 00:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
all of these individuals have the
 
00:52:04.230 --> 00:52:04.240 align:start position:0%
ability to request their own records
 
00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:06.720 align:start position:0%
through through the the ordinary process
 
00:52:08.150 --> 00:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
that applies to
 
00:52:12.950 --> 00:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
ydc and to uh dcyf and dhhs
 
00:52:15.190 --> 00:52:15.200 align:start position:0%
and certainly a cross-reference in this
 
00:52:17.589 --> 00:52:17.599 align:start position:0%
bill to those provisions
 
00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
would would certainly i think help make
 
00:52:21.510 --> 00:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
that more clear
 
00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
this also contemplates adopting
 
00:52:25.030 --> 00:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
guidelines by the administrator and i
 
00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:26.240 align:start position:0%
think in those guidelines would be
 
00:52:28.950 --> 00:52:28.960 align:start position:0%
another place to direct claimants um to
 
00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
the places they could go for resources
 
00:52:33.510 --> 00:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
to help document their claims i think
 
00:52:35.270 --> 00:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
attorney general formula has it correct
 
00:52:36.870 --> 00:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
though to say that the purpose of this
 
00:52:39.190 --> 00:52:39.200 align:start position:0%
process is to try to verify claims if
 
00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:40.230 align:start position:0%
process is to try to verify claims if
possible

00:52:40.230 --> 00:52:40.240 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:52:42.470 --> 00:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
and that's uh that is in the bill at the
 
00:52:45.829 --> 00:52:45.839 align:start position:0%
bottom of page three um so i i i'm not
 
00:52:47.910 --> 00:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
sure what discovery
 
00:52:50.230 --> 00:52:50.240 align:start position:0%
they would need but to the extent that
 
00:52:51.990 --> 00:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
they were to ask the investigator to
 
00:52:53.829 --> 00:52:53.839 align:start position:0%
help them to find something i think
 
00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
that's contemplated by this
 
00:52:59.670 --> 00:52:59.680 align:start position:0%
and could be uh made more clear either
 
00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
in the bill or in the guidelines all
 
00:53:04.470 --> 00:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
right and and what i'm looking for is is
 
00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:05.270 align:start position:0%
right and and what i'm looking for is is
not

00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:53:08.470 --> 00:53:08.480 align:start position:0%
not to have every rock turned over but i
 
00:53:10.950 --> 00:53:10.960 align:start position:0%
i am just trying to make sure that we
 
00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
have a bill that is perceived
 
00:53:16.390 --> 00:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
by stakeholders as as being fair and
 
00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:17.750 align:start position:0%
by stakeholders as as being fair and
balanced

00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
balanced
 
00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
you know if we if we start with a a nice
 
00:53:22.309 --> 00:53:22.319 align:start position:0%
fair and balanced
 
00:53:22.319 --> 00:53:23.109 align:start position:0%
fair and balanced
law

00:53:23.109 --> 00:53:23.119 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:53:25.349 --> 00:53:25.359 align:start position:0%
hopefully that will lead to a trust
 
00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
relationship that's necessary to
 
00:53:29.510 --> 00:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
negotiate all these cases so
 
00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
that's that that's where i'm coming from
 
00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:32.640 align:start position:0%
absolutely and i think those are great
 
00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:33.750 align:start position:0%
absolutely and i think those are great
suggestions

00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
suggestions
 
00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
okay um so
 
00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
so i i have more questions if there's
 
00:53:40.710 --> 00:53:40.720 align:start position:0%
representative wallner you had a
 
00:53:43.589 --> 00:53:43.599 align:start position:0%
question earlier do you still have one
 
00:53:43.599 --> 00:53:44.470 align:start position:0%
question earlier do you still have one
okay

00:53:44.470 --> 00:53:44.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:45.670 align:start position:0%
okay
um

00:53:45.670 --> 00:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:47.829 --> 00:53:47.839 align:start position:0%
so i have a question of
 
00:53:50.309 --> 00:53:50.319 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry where oh yeah go ahead
 
00:53:53.910 --> 00:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:55.670 --> 00:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry there's one other question
 
00:53:57.270 --> 00:53:57.280 align:start position:0%
that i didn't ask you
 
00:54:00.390 --> 00:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
um in this process we have um the
 
00:54:01.670 --> 00:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
attorney general as being the
 
00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:02.950 align:start position:0%
attorney general as being the
administrator

00:54:02.950 --> 00:54:02.960 align:start position:0%
administrator
 
00:54:05.430 --> 00:54:05.440 align:start position:0%
um and you're also a party to the
 
00:54:07.670 --> 00:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
actions i wonder if there's any thought
 
00:54:10.069 --> 00:54:10.079 align:start position:0%
given or any possibility of looking at
 
00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
having a truly neutral not to say that
 
00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
your office is not neutral but it's odd
 
00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:17.200 align:start position:0%
to have a party to what the actions are
 
00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
be the administrator as well
 
00:54:22.309 --> 00:54:22.319 align:start position:0%
and essentially the neutral force
 
00:54:23.910 --> 00:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
and i don't know where else we look so
 
00:54:26.150 --> 00:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
i'm not suggesting exactly who
 
00:54:29.510 --> 00:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
but um is that something that um you
 
00:54:31.990 --> 00:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
thought about or is there a way to make
 
00:54:33.990 --> 00:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
it truly neutral so it's not a party to
 
00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
the actions
 
00:54:37.190 --> 00:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
yeah i would think about it this way you
 
00:54:39.030 --> 00:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
know the
 
00:54:41.270 --> 00:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
this is a it's meant to be a settlement
 
00:54:43.270 --> 00:54:43.280 align:start position:0%
process it's a unique settlement process
 
00:54:45.270 --> 00:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
but but it's a settlement process so the
 
00:54:47.349 --> 00:54:47.359 align:start position:0%
you know the attorney general
 
00:54:47.359 --> 00:54:49.109 align:start position:0%
you know the attorney general
is

00:54:49.109 --> 00:54:49.119 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:54:52.470 --> 00:54:52.480 align:start position:0%
is has been for i mean we could go back
 
00:54:54.390 --> 00:54:54.400 align:start position:0%
and look but i think for
 
00:54:56.950 --> 00:54:56.960 align:start position:0%
most of history is in state history the
 
00:54:59.190 --> 00:54:59.200 align:start position:0%
the authority who can settle cases on
 
00:55:01.030 --> 00:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
behalf of the state
 
00:55:02.549 --> 00:55:02.559 align:start position:0%
the way this process works the
 
00:55:02.559 --> 00:55:04.470 align:start position:0%
the way this process works the
administrator

00:55:04.470 --> 00:55:04.480 align:start position:0%
administrator
 
00:55:06.789 --> 00:55:06.799 align:start position:0%
you know takes in the claim and and does
 
00:55:08.549 --> 00:55:08.559 align:start position:0%
a review and is
 
00:55:11.829 --> 00:55:11.839 align:start position:0%
the first to maybe makes the first offer
 
00:55:13.589 --> 00:55:13.599 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the state or is the first
 
00:55:14.710 --> 00:55:14.720 align:start position:0%
line to
 
00:55:16.150 --> 00:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
to make an offer to settle on behalf of
 
00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
the state but then if the
 
00:55:20.630 --> 00:55:20.640 align:start position:0%
you know if there's a disagreement it
 
00:55:22.950 --> 00:55:22.960 align:start position:0%
does go there is a neutral actor here
 
00:55:25.829 --> 00:55:25.839 align:start position:0%
the arbitrator is the neutral actor
 
00:55:27.510 --> 00:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
i think the
 
00:55:29.510 --> 00:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
the issue with having the administrator
 
00:55:31.750 --> 00:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
be someone other than
 
00:55:33.190 --> 00:55:33.200 align:start position:0%
the attorney general or the department
 
00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
of justice is that then the state
 
00:55:38.069 --> 00:55:38.079 align:start position:0%
doesn't really have a representative in
 
00:55:38.079 --> 00:55:40.150 align:start position:0%
doesn't really have a representative in
the

00:55:40.150 --> 00:55:40.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:55:42.630 --> 00:55:42.640 align:start position:0%
in the equation this is set up so that
 
00:55:44.470 --> 00:55:44.480 align:start position:0%
you know the victim and their attorney
 
00:55:46.789 --> 00:55:46.799 align:start position:0%
or are in the equation the administrator
 
00:55:49.190 --> 00:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
is there on behalf of the state to do a
 
00:55:51.109 --> 00:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
review and make an initial offer and
 
00:55:53.910 --> 00:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
then the arbitrator is the neutral
 
00:55:56.390 --> 00:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
if the administrator is also neutral you
 
00:55:58.789 --> 00:55:58.799 align:start position:0%
have you have the victim who's a party
 
00:56:00.630 --> 00:56:00.640 align:start position:0%
to the case you have a neutral
 
00:56:03.109 --> 00:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
administrator so the state really isn't
 
00:56:03.119 --> 00:56:04.470 align:start position:0%
administrator so the state really isn't
represented

00:56:04.470 --> 00:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
represented
 
00:56:06.870 --> 00:56:06.880 align:start position:0%
um by someone who's looking out for the
 
00:56:09.270 --> 00:56:09.280 align:start position:0%
state and then you have another neutral
 
00:56:11.349 --> 00:56:11.359 align:start position:0%
so i think it is something we've thought
 
00:56:11.359 --> 00:56:12.710 align:start position:0%
so i think it is something we've thought
about

00:56:12.710 --> 00:56:12.720 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:56:13.990 --> 00:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
because i
 
00:56:16.870 --> 00:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
i can understand the initial reaction
 
00:56:18.870 --> 00:56:18.880 align:start position:0%
that oh geez well the administrator is
 
00:56:20.230 --> 00:56:20.240 align:start position:0%
the attorney general and the attorney
 
00:56:21.910 --> 00:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
general's not neutral here the attorney
 
00:56:24.549 --> 00:56:24.559 align:start position:0%
general represents the state but
 
00:56:27.109 --> 00:56:27.119 align:start position:0%
i think as the administrator either i or
 
00:56:29.430 --> 00:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
my designee would do the
 
00:56:31.349 --> 00:56:31.359 align:start position:0%
you know do their best to look at this
 
00:56:32.870 --> 00:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
objectively and come up with something
 
00:56:35.030 --> 00:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
that they think is fair to the state
 
00:56:37.430 --> 00:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
through objective standards and but we
 
00:56:39.270 --> 00:56:39.280 align:start position:0%
would have that neutral arbitrator
 
00:56:40.309 --> 00:56:40.319 align:start position:0%
that's the
 
00:56:42.470 --> 00:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
the second layer of protection and i i
 
00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
think that
 
00:56:46.470 --> 00:56:46.480 align:start position:0%
from my perspective that that's the best
 
00:56:49.270 --> 00:56:49.280 align:start position:0%
and most balanced way to address
 
00:56:51.589 --> 00:56:51.599 align:start position:0%
the concerns and the need for for an
 
00:56:53.910 --> 00:56:53.920 align:start position:0%
ultimate neutral decision maker but
 
00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:55.829 align:start position:0%
ultimate neutral decision maker but
certainly

00:56:55.829 --> 00:56:55.839 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
00:56:58.390 --> 00:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
i imagine the when we have discussions
 
00:57:00.710 --> 00:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
with attorney visananzo and others i
 
00:57:01.990 --> 00:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
imagine we're going to discuss this
 
00:57:04.630 --> 00:57:04.640 align:start position:0%
issue more
 
00:57:09.109 --> 00:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:11.349 --> 00:57:11.359 align:start position:0%
thank you i'd like just to follow up i
 
00:57:12.950 --> 00:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
want to return to the waiver because
 
00:57:14.150 --> 00:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
something occurred to me as you're
 
00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:15.109 align:start position:0%
something occurred to me as you're
speaking

00:57:15.109 --> 00:57:15.119 align:start position:0%
speaking
 
00:57:17.510 --> 00:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
what we're asking claimants to do is
 
00:57:19.750 --> 00:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
waive their rights before we have any
 
00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:20.870 align:start position:0%
waive their rights before we have any
idea

00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
idea
 
00:57:22.710 --> 00:57:22.720 align:start position:0%
how the
 
00:57:24.630 --> 00:57:24.640 align:start position:0%
our administrator is going to view their
 
00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:25.589 align:start position:0%
our administrator is going to view their
claim

00:57:25.589 --> 00:57:25.599 align:start position:0%
claim
 
00:57:27.750 --> 00:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
so if we have an administrator who
 
00:57:30.390 --> 00:57:30.400 align:start position:0%
chooses to view the claims as
 
00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:31.990 align:start position:0%
chooses to view the claims as
requiring

00:57:31.990 --> 00:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
requiring
 
00:57:34.390 --> 00:57:34.400 align:start position:0%
much smaller damages than
 
00:57:36.390 --> 00:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
perhaps the claimants or their attorneys
 
00:57:38.390 --> 00:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
or others would do certainly after the
 
00:57:40.870 --> 00:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
first few claims are administered people
 
00:57:41.829 --> 00:57:41.839 align:start position:0%
are going to get the idea and they're
 
00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
not going to sign up and sign the waiver
 
00:57:45.750 --> 00:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
but even those first few claims when
 
00:57:47.589 --> 00:57:47.599 align:start position:0%
they come in when they have no idea how
 
00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
the administrator is going to rule and
 
00:57:51.270 --> 00:57:51.280 align:start position:0%
view their personal damages and the
 
00:57:52.829 --> 00:57:52.839 align:start position:0%
effect on them for their
 
00:57:55.829 --> 00:57:55.839 align:start position:0%
lifetimes i i'm still troubled by having
 
00:57:57.510 --> 00:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
to sign this waiver before you know
 
00:57:59.670 --> 00:57:59.680 align:start position:0%
anything that's going on and it's so
 
00:58:01.109 --> 00:58:01.119 align:start position:0%
different to me
 
00:58:03.349 --> 00:58:03.359 align:start position:0%
than traditional litigation and i'm
 
00:58:05.270 --> 00:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
wondering if there's a way around this
 
00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:06.710 align:start position:0%
wondering if there's a way around this
to

00:58:06.710 --> 00:58:06.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:58:08.710 --> 00:58:08.720 align:start position:0%
not have them completely waive their
 
00:58:11.190 --> 00:58:11.200 align:start position:0%
rights when you know you could have an
 
00:58:13.349 --> 00:58:13.359 align:start position:0%
administrator that says fine you know
 
00:58:14.789 --> 00:58:14.799 align:start position:0%
some of the some of these claims that
 
00:58:17.030 --> 00:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
you gave us in in that spreadsheet of
 
00:58:19.349 --> 00:58:19.359 align:start position:0%
how you came up with the money were to
 
00:58:21.670 --> 00:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
me surprisingly small given the damages
 
00:58:23.670 --> 00:58:23.680 align:start position:0%
that were done to those victims and the
 
00:58:25.510 --> 00:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
more recent claims the damages are much
 
00:58:27.910 --> 00:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
larger if we have a neutral evaluator
 
00:58:29.510 --> 00:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
that's using those kinds of numbers that
 
00:58:30.950 --> 00:58:30.960 align:start position:0%
were in the spreadsheet that you handed
 
00:58:32.950 --> 00:58:32.960 align:start position:0%
out a week ago those claimants are going
 
00:58:34.950 --> 00:58:34.960 align:start position:0%
to from my point of view be under
 
00:58:36.710 --> 00:58:36.720 align:start position:0%
compensated and and they will have
 
00:58:37.990 --> 00:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
waived their rights and there's no way
 
00:58:39.670 --> 00:58:39.680 align:start position:0%
around it so i'm looking for a solution
 
00:58:41.670 --> 00:58:41.680 align:start position:0%
here as to how these claimants don't
 
00:58:43.190 --> 00:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
have to waive their rights before you
 
00:58:45.750 --> 00:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
have some idea of how the neutral
 
00:58:48.630 --> 00:58:48.640 align:start position:0%
evaluator is viewing the damages
 
00:58:50.789 --> 00:58:50.799 align:start position:0%
i think one important piece of that that
 
00:58:52.630 --> 00:58:52.640 align:start position:0%
gets to your concern representative are
 
00:58:55.030 --> 00:58:55.040 align:start position:0%
the guidelines that that would have to
 
00:58:57.589 --> 00:58:57.599 align:start position:0%
be developed and those guidelines part
 
00:58:58.950 --> 00:58:58.960 align:start position:0%
of what they would
 
00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
lay out
 
00:59:02.950 --> 00:59:02.960 align:start position:0%
are are sort of how to value claims
 
00:59:05.829 --> 00:59:05.839 align:start position:0%
um i talked about this a little bit last
 
00:59:07.829 --> 00:59:07.839 align:start position:0%
week you know that
 
00:59:10.470 --> 00:59:10.480 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit crass to be to to put
 
00:59:12.549 --> 00:59:12.559 align:start position:0%
it bluntly and honestly but there's kind
 
00:59:15.589 --> 00:59:15.599 align:start position:0%
of no way to
 
00:59:17.510 --> 00:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
no way really to do this other than to
 
00:59:19.829 --> 00:59:19.839 align:start position:0%
to assign a value to different forms of
 
00:59:21.829 --> 00:59:21.839 align:start position:0%
abuse and that's partly what these
 
00:59:23.270 --> 00:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
guidelines would do
 
00:59:25.270 --> 00:59:25.280 align:start position:0%
so there
 
00:59:26.870 --> 00:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
someone would only be coming into this
 
00:59:28.630 --> 00:59:28.640 align:start position:0%
process once they see what those
 
00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:29.829 align:start position:0%
process once they see what those
guidelines

00:59:29.829 --> 00:59:29.839 align:start position:0%
guidelines
 
00:59:32.390 --> 00:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
look like as we talked about last week
 
00:59:34.549 --> 00:59:34.559 align:start position:0%
we would des we would intend to design
 
00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
those in such a way that you know it
 
00:59:38.309 --> 00:59:38.319 align:start position:0%
would lead to claims that that are
 
00:59:39.829 --> 00:59:39.839 align:start position:0%
consistent with what
 
00:59:41.670 --> 00:59:41.680 align:start position:0%
the app or consistent with the average
 
00:59:43.990 --> 00:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
that we've found based on based on our
 
00:59:46.230 --> 00:59:46.240 align:start position:0%
research but anyone who came into this
 
00:59:47.910 --> 00:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
process would have notice of that they
 
00:59:50.069 --> 00:59:50.079 align:start position:0%
would they would see those guidelines so
 
00:59:52.710 --> 00:59:52.720 align:start position:0%
there would be some
 
00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:53.510 align:start position:0%
there would be some
there

00:59:53.510 --> 00:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:54.230 align:start position:0%
there
there

00:59:54.230 --> 00:59:54.240 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:59:57.109 --> 00:59:57.119 align:start position:0%
at least on that front they would have
 
00:59:59.109 --> 00:59:59.119 align:start position:0%
some notice on how the administrator is
 
01:00:00.710 --> 01:00:00.720 align:start position:0%
going to be looking at these
 
01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:01.670 align:start position:0%
going to be looking at these
claims

01:00:01.670 --> 01:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
claims
 
01:00:04.309 --> 01:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
so i think that that should address part
 
01:00:06.309 --> 01:00:06.319 align:start position:0%
of your concern
 
01:00:08.230 --> 01:00:08.240 align:start position:0%
as to you know
 
01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
when a waiver happens that i think
 
01:00:12.710 --> 01:00:12.720 align:start position:0%
i can say sitting here today that's
 
01:00:13.670 --> 01:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
something we're willing to continue to
 
01:00:16.630 --> 01:00:16.640 align:start position:0%
think about and again i i imagine that
 
01:00:18.230 --> 01:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
we're going to hear some more ideas on
 
01:00:19.750 --> 01:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
perhaps how
 
01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:22.880 align:start position:0%
how to have that work so i
 
01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
i think in combination with the fact
 
01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:25.990 align:start position:0%
i think in combination with the fact
that

01:00:25.990 --> 01:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:00:27.270 --> 01:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
this will all have to be based on
 
01:00:29.190 --> 01:00:29.200 align:start position:0%
guidelines or at least
 
01:00:31.030 --> 01:00:31.040 align:start position:0%
the guidelines will
 
01:00:32.710 --> 01:00:32.720 align:start position:0%
will give an indication of how these
 
01:00:34.789 --> 01:00:34.799 align:start position:0%
claims will be valued and the fact that
 
01:00:34.799 --> 01:00:35.670 align:start position:0%
claims will be valued and the fact that
we

01:00:35.670 --> 01:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:00:36.950 --> 01:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
we can have some more discussion on that
 
01:00:38.309 --> 01:00:38.319 align:start position:0%
point i mean that's how i would answer
 
01:00:39.990 --> 01:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
your question sitting here
 
01:00:41.430 --> 01:00:41.440 align:start position:0%
sitting here today because i see the
 
01:00:44.390 --> 01:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
concern you know this is a very
 
01:00:46.549 --> 01:00:46.559 align:start position:0%
i think this is just one component of
 
01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
multiple components of this that are a
 
01:00:51.030 --> 01:00:51.040 align:start position:0%
delicate balance trying to to be fair
 
01:00:52.549 --> 01:00:52.559 align:start position:0%
but also
 
01:00:52.559 --> 01:00:53.430 align:start position:0%
but also
um

01:00:53.430 --> 01:00:53.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:55.349 --> 01:00:55.359 align:start position:0%
you know account for the obligation to
 
01:01:02.069 --> 01:01:02.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:04.309 --> 01:01:04.319 align:start position:0%
representative emerit
 
01:01:06.390 --> 01:01:06.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
i'm going to talk in more general terms
 
01:01:11.030 --> 01:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
because i'm not an attorney
 
01:01:12.710 --> 01:01:12.720 align:start position:0%
but since i own my own business i
 
01:01:14.150 --> 01:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
haven't woken up in the middle of night
 
01:01:18.230 --> 01:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
so many times since i read this bill
 
01:01:20.069 --> 01:01:20.079 align:start position:0%
and the and the caveat that was
 
01:01:21.750 --> 01:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
suggested by
 
01:01:23.589 --> 01:01:23.599 align:start position:0%
some testimony last week about not
 
01:01:25.589 --> 01:01:25.599 align:start position:0%
having a ceiling
 
01:01:25.599 --> 01:01:27.349 align:start position:0%
having a ceiling
uh

01:01:27.349 --> 01:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:01:30.390 --> 01:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
basically you could bankrupt the state
 
01:01:31.990 --> 01:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
i mean this process could bankrupt the
 
01:01:34.789 --> 01:01:34.799 align:start position:0%
state it would if over here we're going
 
01:01:36.710 --> 01:01:36.720 align:start position:0%
to do all these claims and i have
 
01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:37.589 align:start position:0%
to do all these claims and i have
nothing

01:01:37.589 --> 01:01:37.599 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
01:01:38.549 --> 01:01:38.559 align:start position:0%
i'm not
 
01:01:40.150 --> 01:01:40.160 align:start position:0%
negative on the claimants don't get me
 
01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:40.950 align:start position:0%
negative on the claimants don't get me
wrong

01:01:40.950 --> 01:01:40.960 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
01:01:44.230 --> 01:01:44.240 align:start position:0%
they have rights to make the claim
 
01:01:46.789 --> 01:01:46.799 align:start position:0%
we also have a responsibility to the
 
01:01:46.799 --> 01:01:47.990 align:start position:0%
we also have a responsibility to the
state

01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:01:50.230 --> 01:01:50.240 align:start position:0%
to not go bankrupt
 
01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:51.510 align:start position:0%
to not go bankrupt
so

01:01:51.510 --> 01:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:01:53.670 --> 01:01:53.680 align:start position:0%
hopefully part of the discussions
 
01:01:56.549 --> 01:01:56.559 align:start position:0%
going forward is is to leave it to have
 
01:01:57.990 --> 01:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
some ceiling if you want to raise the
 
01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.109 align:start position:0%
some ceiling if you want to raise the
ceiling

01:01:59.109 --> 01:01:59.119 align:start position:0%
ceiling
 
01:02:01.029 --> 01:02:01.039 align:start position:0%
fine but i think there needs to be a
 
01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
ceiling as part of this bill
 
01:02:04.789 --> 01:02:04.799 align:start position:0%
uh at least
 
01:02:04.799 --> 01:02:07.270 align:start position:0%
uh at least
for

01:02:07.270 --> 01:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:02:09.029 --> 01:02:09.039 align:start position:0%
to have a bill
 
01:02:10.789 --> 01:02:10.799 align:start position:0%
i don't think i could support something
 
01:02:13.910 --> 01:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
that said well whatever happens happens
 
01:02:14.950 --> 01:02:14.960 align:start position:0%
so i'm
 
01:02:16.950 --> 01:02:16.960 align:start position:0%
i hope the ceiling stays in there in
 
01:02:19.430 --> 01:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
some form even though it can be raised i
 
01:02:21.670 --> 01:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
i understand that
 
01:02:23.589 --> 01:02:23.599 align:start position:0%
the other thing is let me ask you a
 
01:02:25.190 --> 01:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
question about that just to make sure i
 
01:02:26.950 --> 01:02:26.960 align:start position:0%
understand it it currently says there's
 
01:02:29.589 --> 01:02:29.599 align:start position:0%
a hundred million dollar appropriation
 
01:02:31.430 --> 01:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
and that the administrator must come
 
01:02:33.670 --> 01:02:33.680 align:start position:0%
back to ask for more is is that
 
01:02:35.990 --> 01:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
inadequate no that's fine all i'm saying
 
01:02:37.430 --> 01:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
is i just want to
 
01:02:39.750 --> 01:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
arm you when you go to your next round
 
01:02:43.829 --> 01:02:43.839 align:start position:0%
of discussions that it doesn't disappear
 
01:02:46.630 --> 01:02:46.640 align:start position:0%
so it's a blank check so to speak the
 
01:02:49.190 --> 01:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
other thing is i think timing wise and i
 
01:02:52.309 --> 01:02:52.319 align:start position:0%
represent was mentioned earlier
 
01:02:55.270 --> 01:02:55.280 align:start position:0%
once the gun fires
 
01:02:56.390 --> 01:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
you're going to have you're going to get
 
01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:57.430 align:start position:0%
you're going to have you're going to get
swamped

01:02:57.430 --> 01:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
swamped
 
01:02:59.190 --> 01:02:59.200 align:start position:0%
we already know there's 400 plus
 
01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:00.390 align:start position:0%
we already know there's 400 plus
claimants

01:03:00.390 --> 01:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
claimants
 
01:03:01.750 --> 01:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
and you've got some things in here that
 
01:03:04.309 --> 01:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
you're going to turn around in 90 days
 
01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh and i think that was mentioned
 
01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:06.789 align:start position:0%
uh and i think that was mentioned
earlier

01:03:06.789 --> 01:03:06.799 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
01:03:07.990 --> 01:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
i don't think you're going to be able to
 
01:03:09.109 --> 01:03:09.119 align:start position:0%
handle it
 
01:03:09.990 --> 01:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
01:03:11.430 --> 01:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
you're you're getting
 
01:03:13.029 --> 01:03:13.039 align:start position:0%
getting ready to by the time this gets
 
01:03:13.039 --> 01:03:13.990 align:start position:0%
getting ready to by the time this gets
signed

01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
signed
 
01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:16.720 align:start position:0%
you may have four months in order to get
 
01:03:19.190 --> 01:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
all these things you're going to do done
 
01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:20.150 align:start position:0%
all these things you're going to do done
um

01:03:20.150 --> 01:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:22.470 --> 01:03:22.480 align:start position:0%
until here come here it comes
 
01:03:23.910 --> 01:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
and it's going to come in like a tidal
 
01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:24.950 align:start position:0%
and it's going to come in like a tidal
wave

01:03:24.950 --> 01:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
wave
 
01:03:26.549 --> 01:03:26.559 align:start position:0%
because you know there's 400 and some
 
01:03:28.470 --> 01:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
already standing in line
 
01:03:30.230 --> 01:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
and when you start advertising that
 
01:03:32.870 --> 01:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
number could go up so i don't know how
 
01:03:34.950 --> 01:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
to buffer that for you
 
01:03:35.990 --> 01:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
01:03:38.549 --> 01:03:38.559 align:start position:0%
if you had some process that said we
 
01:03:40.309 --> 01:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
will handle claims
 
01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
as best we can in 90 days
 
01:03:45.270 --> 01:03:45.280 align:start position:0%
but when the the level reaches some
 
01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:47.200 align:start position:0%
number and i don't know what it is let's
 
01:03:49.270 --> 01:03:49.280 align:start position:0%
say it's a hundred claims that the
 
01:03:51.990 --> 01:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
process would automatically go to 180
 
01:03:54.390 --> 01:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
days instead of 90 or something i i
 
01:03:55.910 --> 01:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
don't have an answer for you i just have
 
01:03:57.589 --> 01:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
a problem to give you
 
01:03:57.599 --> 01:03:58.789 align:start position:0%
a problem to give you
so

01:03:58.789 --> 01:03:58.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:00.880 align:start position:0%
that those are my thoughts i i i just
 
01:04:01.910 --> 01:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
want to
 
01:04:03.190 --> 01:04:03.200 align:start position:0%
caution that
 
01:04:06.069 --> 01:04:06.079 align:start position:0%
this is going to come in a very big lump
 
01:04:07.990 --> 01:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
yep you know
 
01:04:11.829 --> 01:04:11.839 align:start position:0%
i i i agree you know i i i think to your
 
01:04:13.510 --> 01:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
first point i just want to assure you
 
01:04:16.230 --> 01:04:16.240 align:start position:0%
i'm absolutely with you on on the the
 
01:04:17.910 --> 01:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
ceiling concept and the fact that we
 
01:04:20.230 --> 01:04:20.240 align:start position:0%
have to you know we have to this is all
 
01:04:22.630 --> 01:04:22.640 align:start position:0%
about balancing the the you know the the
 
01:04:23.829 --> 01:04:23.839 align:start position:0%
goal of doing
 
01:04:26.230 --> 01:04:26.240 align:start position:0%
um providing some compensation but also
 
01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:28.640 align:start position:0%
protecting protecting the state um and
 
01:04:30.230 --> 01:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
which is ultimately protecting all of us
 
01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
you know we we are the state at the end
 
01:04:34.069 --> 01:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
of the day so so i'm with you on that i
 
01:04:35.029 --> 01:04:35.039 align:start position:0%
don't think you need to worry that
 
01:04:37.190 --> 01:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
that's gonna that's gonna disappear at
 
01:04:38.390 --> 01:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
least from my perspective it's
 
01:04:40.150 --> 01:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
ultimately up to you but but from my
 
01:04:41.589 --> 01:04:41.599 align:start position:0%
perspective that would not disappear
 
01:04:45.029 --> 01:04:45.039 align:start position:0%
from my recommendations um as far as the
 
01:04:45.039 --> 01:04:47.510 align:start position:0%
from my recommendations um as far as the
timelines

01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
timelines
 
01:04:49.270 --> 01:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
one we are
 
01:04:50.950 --> 01:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
not that we would ever assume you know
 
01:04:52.710 --> 01:04:52.720 align:start position:0%
what the legislature would or were not
 
01:04:55.750 --> 01:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
would not enact but we are preparing for
 
01:04:57.750 --> 01:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
this even now in the event that this
 
01:04:59.430 --> 01:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
gets enacted so thinking about what
 
01:05:00.789 --> 01:05:00.799 align:start position:0%
guidelines would look like thinking
 
01:05:03.430 --> 01:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
about how this would work so i we are
 
01:05:06.390 --> 01:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
doing that i have the same
 
01:05:08.950 --> 01:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
you know i'll i'll admit stress about
 
01:05:10.710 --> 01:05:10.720 align:start position:0%
the timelines and and i think what we're
 
01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
going to continue to try to do is
 
01:05:14.870 --> 01:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
is balance the need to make sure this
 
01:05:17.349 --> 01:05:17.359 align:start position:0%
moves quickly but not as i said to
 
01:05:17.359 --> 01:05:18.630 align:start position:0%
moves quickly but not as i said to
representative

01:05:18.630 --> 01:05:18.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:05:21.750 --> 01:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
rogers not aspire or not be so ambitious
 
01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:22.470 align:start position:0%
rogers not aspire or not be so ambitious
that

01:05:22.470 --> 01:05:22.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:05:23.910 --> 01:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:05:26.150 --> 01:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
this just goes off the rails so i think
 
01:05:28.470 --> 01:05:28.480 align:start position:0%
we've we've tried to build some buffer
 
01:05:30.150 --> 01:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
in there in some cases you know the
 
01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:31.349 align:start position:0%
in there in some cases you know the
timelines

01:05:31.349 --> 01:05:31.359 align:start position:0%
timelines
 
01:05:34.150 --> 01:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
i think it's best efforts 90 days but it
 
01:05:36.950 --> 01:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
could be more or but it could be another
 
01:05:39.430 --> 01:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
90 days there are other points where
 
01:05:41.270 --> 01:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
it has to be submitted to arbitration
 
01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
within a certain amount of time but it
 
01:05:43.750 --> 01:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily require that
 
01:05:46.789 --> 01:05:46.799 align:start position:0%
arbitration has to then happen
 
01:05:49.029 --> 01:05:49.039 align:start position:0%
within a set time so we've tried to
 
01:05:50.309 --> 01:05:50.319 align:start position:0%
build some buffer in there but we will
 
01:05:51.670 --> 01:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
continue to
 
01:05:53.430 --> 01:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
to think about that and refine that
 
01:05:55.829 --> 01:05:55.839 align:start position:0%
because i absolutely recognize that that
 
01:05:57.270 --> 01:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
this is going to be a challenge you know
 
01:05:58.309 --> 01:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
i i would
 
01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
i would be lying to you if i sat here
 
01:06:01.109 --> 01:06:01.119 align:start position:0%
and said nope
 
01:06:03.990 --> 01:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
we will be able to do this easily this
 
01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
will require a lot of hard work it will
 
01:06:08.470 --> 01:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
be a challenge but i i am confident that
 
01:06:10.870 --> 01:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
we're up to it and i'm confident that we
 
01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:11.670 align:start position:0%
we're up to it and i'm confident that we
will

01:06:11.670 --> 01:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
do an honest assessment of what outside
 
01:06:15.430 --> 01:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
help we need and we'll go get it and we
 
01:06:17.270 --> 01:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
can keep those costs as low as possible
 
01:06:20.870 --> 01:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
but but we recognize that this will be
 
01:06:23.190 --> 01:06:23.200 align:start position:0%
if the legislature enacts this bill that
 
01:06:25.589 --> 01:06:25.599 align:start position:0%
this will be a very challenging process
 
01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
for us to pull off but i i'm confident
 
01:06:29.910 --> 01:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
we can do it and we will continue to
 
01:06:32.950 --> 01:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
think of ways to
 
01:06:34.950 --> 01:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
make it even more likely that we'll pull
 
01:06:36.309 --> 01:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
it off
 
01:06:37.990 --> 01:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
additional questions
 
01:06:41.190 --> 01:06:41.200 align:start position:0%
okay so so i i like that training
 
01:06:43.990 --> 01:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
thought and because it triggers uh
 
01:06:46.150 --> 01:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
something i've been wanting to ask you
 
01:06:48.630 --> 01:06:48.640 align:start position:0%
the the effective date on this is
 
01:06:50.390 --> 01:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
september 1.
 
01:06:52.789 --> 01:06:52.799 align:start position:0%
and and it seems to me
 
01:06:54.950 --> 01:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
like uh you all are going to be
 
01:06:58.230 --> 01:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
developing forms you're negotiating with
 
01:07:00.950 --> 01:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
the stakeholders about this
 
01:07:03.029 --> 01:07:03.039 align:start position:0%
you want to develop these guidelines
 
01:07:05.109 --> 01:07:05.119 align:start position:0%
probably earlier in the process than
 
01:07:05.119 --> 01:07:06.069 align:start position:0%
probably earlier in the process than
later

01:07:06.069 --> 01:07:06.079 align:start position:0%
later
 
01:07:08.870 --> 01:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
and then it refers to
 
01:07:11.349 --> 01:07:11.359 align:start position:0%
the need for the administrator to be
 
01:07:14.309 --> 01:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
able to delegate a completed claim to an
 
01:07:16.549 --> 01:07:16.559 align:start position:0%
investigator to go look look into the
 
01:07:16.559 --> 01:07:17.829 align:start position:0%
investigator to go look look into the
details

01:07:17.829 --> 01:07:17.839 align:start position:0%
details
 
01:07:17.839 --> 01:07:18.870 align:start position:0%
details
so

01:07:18.870 --> 01:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:07:22.710 --> 01:07:22.720 align:start position:0%
that that that implies a manpower issue
 
01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
and perhaps because we're not doing this
 
01:07:27.029 --> 01:07:27.039 align:start position:0%
work now you need new investigators
 
01:07:29.829 --> 01:07:29.839 align:start position:0%
additional supplemental
 
01:07:29.839 --> 01:07:30.710 align:start position:0%
additional supplemental
folks

01:07:30.710 --> 01:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
folks
 
01:07:33.510 --> 01:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
that you you you would have to begin the
 
01:07:35.910 --> 01:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
hiring process about now if you're going
 
01:07:38.069 --> 01:07:38.079 align:start position:0%
to have them in september right i'm just
 
01:07:38.079 --> 01:07:39.190 align:start position:0%
to have them in september right i'm just
guessing

01:07:39.190 --> 01:07:39.200 align:start position:0%
guessing
 
01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:40.069 align:start position:0%
guessing
so

01:07:40.069 --> 01:07:40.079 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:07:42.950 --> 01:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
all of that is a setup to ask the
 
01:07:44.950 --> 01:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
question of
 
01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:46.390 align:start position:0%
question of
um

01:07:46.390 --> 01:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:48.150 --> 01:07:48.160 align:start position:0%
does this effective date need to be
 
01:07:50.710 --> 01:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
sooner or do you are would you already
 
01:07:52.950 --> 01:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
have the authority to spend money on all
 
01:07:54.630 --> 01:07:54.640 align:start position:0%
of this stuff
 
01:07:57.190 --> 01:07:57.200 align:start position:0%
before this effective date
 
01:07:59.190 --> 01:07:59.200 align:start position:0%
what you know if you feel like you need
 
01:08:01.270 --> 01:08:01.280 align:start position:0%
to start spending some money to get
 
01:08:04.230 --> 01:08:04.240 align:start position:0%
ready to ramp up for this
 
01:08:06.069 --> 01:08:06.079 align:start position:0%
when would you begin to spend that money
 
01:08:08.470 --> 01:08:08.480 align:start position:0%
would you want it to have passed the
 
01:08:11.349 --> 01:08:11.359 align:start position:0%
senate before you you started to ramp up
 
01:08:14.150 --> 01:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
i'm just i'm curious about your timeline
 
01:08:16.229 --> 01:08:16.239 align:start position:0%
yeah no it's it's a good question you
 
01:08:18.709 --> 01:08:18.719 align:start position:0%
know to the extent we we need to be able
 
01:08:20.070 --> 01:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
to spend money you know if we're going
 
01:08:23.110 --> 01:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
to spend it out of this fund
 
01:08:24.709 --> 01:08:24.719 align:start position:0%
obviously the bill would need to be
 
01:08:26.870 --> 01:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
enacted and be effective before before
 
01:08:30.789 --> 01:08:30.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:31.990 --> 01:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
i think the best way i can answer that
 
01:08:33.110 --> 01:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
is i think it's probably something we
 
01:08:34.709 --> 01:08:34.719 align:start position:0%
need to think about and make sure that
 
01:08:36.390 --> 01:08:36.400 align:start position:0%
we have thought we
 
01:08:38.630 --> 01:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
we have this timeline in a form that
 
01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
that is workable we have given that some
 
01:08:41.829 --> 01:08:41.839 align:start position:0%
thought but
 
01:08:43.349 --> 01:08:43.359 align:start position:0%
but i um
 
01:08:47.669 --> 01:08:47.679 align:start position:0%
you know we have other ways at doj to to
 
01:08:49.829 --> 01:08:49.839 align:start position:0%
bring in outside resources if we need to
 
01:08:51.590 --> 01:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
through the litigation fund and i always
 
01:08:53.749 --> 01:08:53.759 align:start position:0%
try to build some flexibility in there
 
01:08:56.309 --> 01:08:56.319 align:start position:0%
we can reallocate resources internally
 
01:08:59.269 --> 01:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
temporarily if we need to before we
 
01:09:00.630 --> 01:09:00.640 align:start position:0%
perhaps bring in the additional
 
01:09:03.110 --> 01:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
resources through this fund so we we
 
01:09:07.269 --> 01:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
have ways to to address that but but we
 
01:09:07.279 --> 01:09:08.709 align:start position:0%
have ways to to address that but but we
will

01:09:08.709 --> 01:09:08.719 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:09:10.309 --> 01:09:10.319 align:start position:0%
i think for purposes of today what i
 
01:09:11.749 --> 01:09:11.759 align:start position:0%
should say and commit to you is that
 
01:09:11.759 --> 01:09:12.550 align:start position:0%
should say and commit to you is that
we'll

01:09:12.550 --> 01:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
we'll
 
01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:14.159 align:start position:0%
think about that further we'll take your
 
01:09:16.789 --> 01:09:16.799 align:start position:0%
concerns uh into account and see whether
 
01:09:18.870 --> 01:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
that we may need to adjust those
 
01:09:21.110 --> 01:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
timelines again we're trying to balance
 
01:09:22.789 --> 01:09:22.799 align:start position:0%
you know the need to have time to do
 
01:09:24.789 --> 01:09:24.799 align:start position:0%
what we need to do logistically with the
 
01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
desire to to move this right i mean you
 
01:09:30.070 --> 01:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
state in here september is when people
 
01:09:32.149 --> 01:09:32.159 align:start position:0%
or october can is when you can start to
 
01:09:32.159 --> 01:09:33.269 align:start position:0%
or october can is when you can start to
accept

01:09:33.269 --> 01:09:33.279 align:start position:0%
accept
 
01:09:36.630 --> 01:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
claimant or claims and that that's fine
 
01:09:38.149 --> 01:09:38.159 align:start position:0%
but it just feels to me like you want
 
01:09:40.229 --> 01:09:40.239 align:start position:0%
the effective date as soon as possible
 
01:09:42.229 --> 01:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
right so that you you've got the money
 
01:09:44.470 --> 01:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
spigot turned on so you can get ready
 
01:09:47.430 --> 01:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
for october yep so so if you would think
 
01:09:51.590 --> 01:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:54.310 --> 01:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
i i had another question about the
 
01:09:56.229 --> 01:09:56.239 align:start position:0%
contingency fees
 
01:09:59.669 --> 01:09:59.679 align:start position:0%
contingency fees um are set up
 
01:09:59.679 --> 01:10:00.790 align:start position:0%
contingency fees um are set up
25

01:10:00.790 --> 01:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
25
 
01:10:01.910 --> 01:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
if they just go through the
 
01:10:04.709 --> 01:10:04.719 align:start position:0%
administrative process and 33 and
 
01:10:07.189 --> 01:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
something percent if they uh go through
 
01:10:07.199 --> 01:10:08.709 align:start position:0%
something percent if they uh go through
arbitration

01:10:08.709 --> 01:10:08.719 align:start position:0%
arbitration
 
01:10:10.470 --> 01:10:10.480 align:start position:0%
and i saw where
 
01:10:12.790 --> 01:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
if they go to arbitration
 
01:10:16.630 --> 01:10:16.640 align:start position:0%
the um claimants attorney is responsible
 
01:10:19.750 --> 01:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
for half of the arbitration costs
 
01:10:23.669 --> 01:10:23.679 align:start position:0%
and i'm i'm just wondering if if that's
 
01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
enough incentive for them
 
01:10:29.430 --> 01:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
to be judicious in their use of the
 
01:10:31.270 --> 01:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
arbitration route
 
01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:32.550 align:start position:0%
arbitration route
because

01:10:32.550 --> 01:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
i i'm a cynical individual
 
01:10:37.750 --> 01:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
and and if somebody can get a
 
01:10:40.390 --> 01:10:40.400 align:start position:0%
significant amount more money and they
 
01:10:42.390 --> 01:10:42.400 align:start position:0%
think the arbitration route is more
 
01:10:45.189 --> 01:10:45.199 align:start position:0%
generous than the administrative route i
 
01:10:47.189 --> 01:10:47.199 align:start position:0%
i i don't see from an efficiency
 
01:10:49.270 --> 01:10:49.280 align:start position:0%
perspective anything to keep people from
 
01:10:51.590 --> 01:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
going the more laborious route of
 
01:10:54.390 --> 01:10:54.400 align:start position:0%
arbitration so
 
01:10:56.550 --> 01:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
are do you think these contingency fees
 
01:10:58.149 --> 01:10:58.159 align:start position:0%
are set right do you think the penalties
 
01:11:00.550 --> 01:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
are not penalties but the disincentives
 
01:11:03.030 --> 01:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
to go to arbitration are set up right so
 
01:11:05.030 --> 01:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
that we don't just have everything end
 
01:11:09.590 --> 01:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:11.430 --> 01:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
i think so i mean i think they're i
 
01:11:14.310 --> 01:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
think they're they're set fine at least
 
01:11:16.149 --> 01:11:16.159 align:start position:0%
for now i mean we can think about it
 
01:11:17.669 --> 01:11:17.679 align:start position:0%
further but i'll give you my thought
 
01:11:17.679 --> 01:11:19.350 align:start position:0%
further but i'll give you my thought
process

01:11:19.350 --> 01:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
the way the bill is drafted is that if
 
01:11:23.030 --> 01:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
if you go to arbitration the claimant is
 
01:11:25.030 --> 01:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
responsible for half of
 
01:11:26.229 --> 01:11:26.239 align:start position:0%
the fees it could come out of their
 
01:11:26.239 --> 01:11:27.110 align:start position:0%
the fees it could come out of their
award

01:11:27.110 --> 01:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
award
 
01:11:29.189 --> 01:11:29.199 align:start position:0%
but half of of any expenses of
 
01:11:29.199 --> 01:11:30.630 align:start position:0%
but half of of any expenses of
arbitration

01:11:30.630 --> 01:11:30.640 align:start position:0%
arbitration
 
01:11:32.950 --> 01:11:32.960 align:start position:0%
um you also could then be responsible
 
01:11:34.950 --> 01:11:34.960 align:start position:0%
for even more attorneys fees because the
 
01:11:37.350 --> 01:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
cap is higher and i i think
 
01:11:39.669 --> 01:11:39.679 align:start position:0%
there's a there's just an inherent risk
 
01:11:42.390 --> 01:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
in arbitration too i mean i don't
 
01:11:44.470 --> 01:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that
 
01:11:46.790 --> 01:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
someone would go into this
 
01:11:48.709 --> 01:11:48.719 align:start position:0%
being that confident that if they don't
 
01:11:48.719 --> 01:11:49.830 align:start position:0%
being that confident that if they don't
accept

01:11:49.830 --> 01:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
accept
 
01:11:51.830 --> 01:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
the the offer of the administrator
 
01:11:54.550 --> 01:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
they're gonna get more in arbitration so
 
01:11:56.310 --> 01:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
i think when you add up the the
 
01:11:58.149 --> 01:11:58.159 align:start position:0%
additional cost to go and they're just
 
01:12:00.070 --> 01:12:00.080 align:start position:0%
the risk that you'll get less
 
01:12:02.709 --> 01:12:02.719 align:start position:0%
i think the incentive probably is is
 
01:12:04.390 --> 01:12:04.400 align:start position:0%
is placed
 
01:12:07.270 --> 01:12:07.280 align:start position:0%
is is well placed but but we can we can
 
01:12:09.110 --> 01:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
think about that a little more just look
 
01:12:11.430 --> 01:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
that's completely a legal culture
 
01:12:13.510 --> 01:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
question that i'm i'm not qualified to
 
01:12:14.790 --> 01:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
answer i just
 
01:12:17.510 --> 01:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
am looking at it and wondering yeah yeah
 
01:12:18.630 --> 01:12:18.640 align:start position:0%
i think to your point we wouldn't want
 
01:12:20.390 --> 01:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
everyone just going to arbitration
 
01:12:22.870 --> 01:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
because they figure i might as well go
 
01:12:24.790 --> 01:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
to arbitration but i don't think this is
 
01:12:27.270 --> 01:12:27.280 align:start position:0%
nothing to lose yeah um
 
01:12:29.350 --> 01:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
okay so um
 
01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:30.870 align:start position:0%
okay so um
25

01:12:30.870 --> 01:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
25
 
01:12:33.669 --> 01:12:33.679 align:start position:0%
for a contingency fee for a system that
 
01:12:35.189 --> 01:12:35.199 align:start position:0%
seems to be
 
01:12:36.950 --> 01:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
fairly simple
 
01:12:39.350 --> 01:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
to set up to get a settlement
 
01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:40.229 align:start position:0%
to set up to get a settlement
just

01:12:40.229 --> 01:12:40.239 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:12:43.110 --> 01:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
sounds to me like maybe it's too rich we
 
01:12:45.270 --> 01:12:45.280 align:start position:0%
had testimony in the hearing the other
 
01:12:46.870 --> 01:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
day that says
 
01:12:49.270 --> 01:12:49.280 align:start position:0%
suggested that claimants were deserving
 
01:12:50.709 --> 01:12:50.719 align:start position:0%
more money
 
01:12:52.630 --> 01:12:52.640 align:start position:0%
one way to get the claimant more money
 
01:12:55.350 --> 01:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
is to reduce the contingency fees
 
01:13:00.229 --> 01:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
so so how did we get to 25 and 33 and do
 
01:13:01.910 --> 01:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
you still think those are the right
 
01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:04.310 align:start position:0%
you still think those are the right
numbers

01:13:04.310 --> 01:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
01:13:05.830 --> 01:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
yeah so 20
 
01:13:07.350 --> 01:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
for one i'll just say these are these
 
01:13:10.229 --> 01:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
are caps so it's not necessarily saying
 
01:13:11.990 --> 01:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
that this would be this would be an
 
01:13:14.149 --> 01:13:14.159 align:start position:0%
automatic to you 25
 
01:13:17.030 --> 01:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
the arbitrator can approve
 
01:13:18.390 --> 01:13:18.400 align:start position:0%
or the administrator or arbitrator can
 
01:13:22.470 --> 01:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
approve an award of fees up to 25 if you
 
01:13:25.590 --> 01:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
don't go to arbitration and up to 33
 
01:13:27.030 --> 01:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
if you go to arbitration so i think
 
01:13:28.709 --> 01:13:28.719 align:start position:0%
that's the first important point those
 
01:13:31.910 --> 01:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
are just those are not to exceed caps
 
01:13:35.030 --> 01:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:37.030 --> 01:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:38.149 align:start position:0%
i think that
we

01:13:38.149 --> 01:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:13:40.550 --> 01:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
you know we can't assume that someone
 
01:13:42.310 --> 01:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
who comes through this process that
 
01:13:44.390 --> 01:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
their attorney that they've engaged you
 
01:13:46.070 --> 01:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
know was only engaged at the beginning
 
01:13:47.590 --> 01:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
when they came through this process they
 
01:13:50.070 --> 01:13:50.080 align:start position:0%
still may have done a lot of work before
 
01:13:51.669 --> 01:13:51.679 align:start position:0%
they ever got to this process and i
 
01:13:53.910 --> 01:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
think that that is potentially the case
 
01:13:55.270 --> 01:13:55.280 align:start position:0%
with a lot of the victims that we see
 
01:13:57.830 --> 01:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
represented by by council who appeared
 
01:13:59.350 --> 01:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
last week
 
01:14:01.910 --> 01:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
my my familiarity with these types of
 
01:14:05.189 --> 01:14:05.199 align:start position:0%
agreements is that 25 percent 33
 
01:14:07.350 --> 01:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
though that's not that doesn't sound
 
01:14:10.149 --> 01:14:10.159 align:start position:0%
high to me that sounds pretty standard
 
01:14:13.030 --> 01:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
and i you certainly see cases where you
 
01:14:16.149 --> 01:14:16.159 align:start position:0%
have a contingency agreement and
 
01:14:18.390 --> 01:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
you don't do much work at all and you
 
01:14:20.149 --> 01:14:20.159 align:start position:0%
end but your client gets a large
 
01:14:23.030 --> 01:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
recovery and you do very well yeah you
 
01:14:24.470 --> 01:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
see other cases where it doesn't work
 
01:14:25.990 --> 01:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
out as well that's the nature of
 
01:14:29.189 --> 01:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
contingency i think that
 
01:14:31.669 --> 01:14:31.679 align:start position:0%
we don't know what the terms are that
 
01:14:34.229 --> 01:14:34.239 align:start position:0%
these particular victims have with their
 
01:14:36.070 --> 01:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
lawyers that they've hired
 
01:14:38.550 --> 01:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
but in the past
 
01:14:39.990 --> 01:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
individuals who have brought forward
 
01:14:42.229 --> 01:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
claims against the state for these types
 
01:14:43.669 --> 01:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
of allegations
 
01:14:45.110 --> 01:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
we've seen
 
01:14:47.030 --> 01:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
fee agreements that have had percentages
 
01:14:50.149 --> 01:14:50.159 align:start position:0%
that that look about in this range
 
01:14:51.270 --> 01:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
so i
 
01:14:53.270 --> 01:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
i completely agree with you that i'd
 
01:14:55.830 --> 01:14:55.840 align:start position:0%
much rather see more of this money go to
 
01:14:59.910 --> 01:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
the victims themselves but these numbers
 
01:15:02.149 --> 01:15:02.159 align:start position:0%
don't strike me as being outside of
 
01:15:05.510 --> 01:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
standard numbers okay thanks um
 
01:15:08.830 --> 01:15:08.840 align:start position:0%
i'm now i'm looking at page four
 
01:15:13.669 --> 01:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
uh in the area lines 24 through 28
 
01:15:17.030 --> 01:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:19.270 --> 01:15:19.280 align:start position:0%
the amount of time
 
01:15:21.590 --> 01:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
that's reserved for arbitration
 
01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
and it says an arbitration meeting can
 
01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:24.790 align:start position:0%
and it says an arbitration meeting can
last

01:15:24.790 --> 01:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
last
 
01:15:26.790 --> 01:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
no longer than three hours or can't be
 
01:15:29.030 --> 01:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
scheduled for more than three hours but
 
01:15:31.910 --> 01:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
it it gives the uh the arb the
 
01:15:34.470 --> 01:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
arbitrator and the parties can make
 
01:15:36.870 --> 01:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
additional submissions prior to the wait
 
01:15:38.950 --> 01:15:38.960 align:start position:0%
that's not what i meant to say
 
01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:39.750 align:start position:0%
that's not what i meant to say
it's

01:15:39.750 --> 01:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:15:41.750 --> 01:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
at the arbitration hearing the parties
 
01:15:43.910 --> 01:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
may present additional evidence and
 
01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:45.189 align:start position:0%
may present additional evidence and
witnesses

01:15:45.189 --> 01:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
witnesses
 
01:15:48.070 --> 01:15:48.080 align:start position:0%
and so i you know i'm just wondering
 
01:15:50.630 --> 01:15:50.640 align:start position:0%
if um if we're maybe potentially
 
01:15:54.070 --> 01:15:54.080 align:start position:0%
hamstringing the arbitrator if we say no
 
01:15:56.070 --> 01:15:56.080 align:start position:0%
more than three hours and what's the
 
01:15:57.590 --> 01:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
what's the point in putting the
 
01:16:00.630 --> 01:16:00.640 align:start position:0%
three-hour limitation in there
 
01:16:03.110 --> 01:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
i i think the point it kind of flows
 
01:16:05.030 --> 01:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
from the intent of this to make this a
 
01:16:08.870 --> 01:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
claims verification process and not a
 
01:16:11.750 --> 01:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
overly adversarial process and so i
 
01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:12.870 align:start position:0%
overly adversarial process and so i
think

01:16:12.870 --> 01:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:16:14.550 --> 01:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
if this process is going to work that
 
01:16:16.950 --> 01:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
way we wouldn't envision these hearings
 
01:16:19.030 --> 01:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
needing to be longer than three hours i
 
01:16:21.430 --> 01:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
will just look to attorney ramsey to see
 
01:16:23.110 --> 01:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
if she has anything to add on that but
 
01:16:25.830 --> 01:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
but i think it flows from that
 
01:16:27.830 --> 01:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
that that concept that this is more of a
 
01:16:29.990 --> 01:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
claims verification process than an
 
01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.430 align:start position:0%
claims verification process than an
adversarial

01:16:31.430 --> 01:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
adversarial
 
01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:32.830 align:start position:0%
adversarial
arbitration

01:16:32.830 --> 01:16:32.840 align:start position:0%
arbitration
 
01:16:34.870 --> 01:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
process is that right do you have
 
01:16:36.709 --> 01:16:36.719 align:start position:0%
anything to add on that
 
01:16:36.719 --> 01:16:37.830 align:start position:0%
anything to add on that
okay

01:16:37.830 --> 01:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:39.030 align:start position:0%
okay
okay

01:16:39.030 --> 01:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:16:41.750 --> 01:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
do you see any potential value in adding
 
01:16:43.189 --> 01:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
a sunset
 
01:16:45.350 --> 01:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
clause to this or or do you think when
 
01:16:47.910 --> 01:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
we wind down the fun it'll this law will
 
01:16:50.070 --> 01:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
just basically go away should or or
 
01:16:53.030 --> 01:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
should we just sunset it so that it it
 
01:16:56.630 --> 01:16:56.640 align:start position:0%
it dies on july 1 of 2032.
 
01:16:59.030 --> 01:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
the law itself yeah
 
01:17:00.550 --> 01:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
i guess that i think it would make sense
 
01:17:02.950 --> 01:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
if the fund is going to go away on july
 
01:17:06.310 --> 01:17:06.320 align:start position:0%
one on june 30th or june 30th yeah 2032
 
01:17:07.750 --> 01:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
i think it makes sense for for this
 
01:17:09.669 --> 01:17:09.679 align:start position:0%
statute to just be repealed at that
 
01:17:11.350 --> 01:17:11.360 align:start position:0%
point as well so
 
01:17:13.189 --> 01:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
yeah i think that would make sense okay
 
01:17:15.990 --> 01:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
i because i'll probably forget by 2032
 
01:17:17.030 --> 01:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
unless you
 
01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:19.750 align:start position:0%
unless you
okay

01:17:19.750 --> 01:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:21.669 --> 01:17:21.679 align:start position:0%
i i think there are some provisions of
 
01:17:24.310 --> 01:17:24.320 align:start position:0%
it that we might want to have okay
 
01:17:25.430 --> 01:17:25.440 align:start position:0%
let's let's
 
01:17:26.870 --> 01:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
let me let's think about that a little
 
01:17:29.510 --> 01:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
bit okay fine fine um because i was
 
01:17:31.189 --> 01:17:31.199 align:start position:0%
thinking you might need six months to
 
01:17:33.189 --> 01:17:33.199 align:start position:0%
finish up all the paperwork too i don't
 
01:17:37.590 --> 01:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:40.550 --> 01:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
okay so so i think you all attempted to
 
01:17:42.310 --> 01:17:42.320 align:start position:0%
address the right to know issue right
 
01:17:44.950 --> 01:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
out of the gate and and i think the
 
01:17:49.189 --> 01:17:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:51.110 --> 01:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
why don't we just say
 
01:17:52.470 --> 01:17:52.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to comply with the right to
 
01:17:53.910 --> 01:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
know law
 
01:18:00.070 --> 01:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:01.590 --> 01:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
because i think
 
01:18:05.189 --> 01:18:05.199 align:start position:0%
that would entail
 
01:18:07.270 --> 01:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
parts of this process being open to the
 
01:18:12.390 --> 01:18:12.400 align:start position:0%
public that would would not um
 
01:18:15.350 --> 01:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
would not help us if we're trying to
 
01:18:18.470 --> 01:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
to encourage a victim to come through
 
01:18:20.550 --> 01:18:20.560 align:start position:0%
this process i
 
01:18:22.870 --> 01:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
i know that there is a you know at the
 
01:18:25.430 --> 01:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
end of the day even under 91a if there's
 
01:18:27.270 --> 01:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
a privacy interest that outweighs the
 
01:18:29.430 --> 01:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
public's interest in getting access to
 
01:18:31.990 --> 01:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
information that that can keep something
 
01:18:33.590 --> 01:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
from from being
 
01:18:35.830 --> 01:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
being made public but needing to do that
 
01:18:39.590 --> 01:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
analysis in every case and every part of
 
01:18:41.590 --> 01:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
every proceeding i think would be very
 
01:18:43.590 --> 01:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
burdensome i think of vic i think
 
01:18:45.189 --> 01:18:45.199 align:start position:0%
victims would want to have some level of
 
01:18:47.590 --> 01:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
certainty that at least certain parts of
 
01:18:49.910 --> 01:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
this would be would be kept confidential
 
01:18:51.910 --> 01:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
01:18:54.390 --> 01:18:54.400 align:start position:0%
in my mind the public's interest in this
 
01:18:57.430 --> 01:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:00.070 --> 01:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
frankly how much money is being spent i
 
01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:00.950 align:start position:0%
frankly how much money is being spent i
think

01:19:00.950 --> 01:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:19:04.229 --> 01:19:04.239 align:start position:0%
i would feel pretty safe in saying that
 
01:19:06.870 --> 01:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
you know the victim's privacy interest
 
01:19:09.270 --> 01:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
in some of the more sensitive details
 
01:19:11.110 --> 01:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
would pretty much always outweigh the
 
01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:12.470 align:start position:0%
would pretty much always outweigh the
public's

01:19:12.470 --> 01:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
public's
 
01:19:15.430 --> 01:19:15.440 align:start position:0%
interest in seeing those details
 
01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:16.070 align:start position:0%
interest in seeing those details
so

01:19:16.070 --> 01:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:17.189 align:start position:0%
so
so

01:19:17.189 --> 01:19:17.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:19:18.630 --> 01:19:18.640 align:start position:0%
to what extent
 
01:19:20.709 --> 01:19:20.719 align:start position:0%
is there a public interest in the
 
01:19:24.149 --> 01:19:24.159 align:start position:0%
details of the abuse itself
 
01:19:26.790 --> 01:19:26.800 align:start position:0%
you know it it could potentially get
 
01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:27.990 align:start position:0%
you know it it could potentially get
lurid

01:19:27.990 --> 01:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
lurid
 
01:19:31.350 --> 01:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
and so somewhere between lord and
 
01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:33.430 align:start position:0%
and so somewhere between lord and
academic

01:19:33.430 --> 01:19:33.440 align:start position:0%
academic
 
01:19:34.830 --> 01:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
do you imagine
 
01:19:37.750 --> 01:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
describing the nature of the abuse so
 
01:19:39.750 --> 01:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
that people could look at that and go
 
01:19:46.709 --> 01:19:46.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:48.470 --> 01:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
i think that there would be some level
 
01:19:50.550 --> 01:19:50.560 align:start position:0%
of reporting on that i think what it
 
01:19:53.189 --> 01:19:53.199 align:start position:0%
would not but what we would not have is
 
01:19:55.270 --> 01:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
the specific
 
01:19:58.709 --> 01:19:58.719 align:start position:0%
instances or details tied to
 
01:20:01.350 --> 01:20:01.360 align:start position:0%
a specific person yeah i don't think you
 
01:20:03.910 --> 01:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
could prescribe that in advance but i it
 
01:20:06.070 --> 01:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
just seems to me like that's part of
 
01:20:08.229 --> 01:20:08.239 align:start position:0%
what you're reporting you need to think
 
01:20:10.790 --> 01:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
through is how much is enough and how
 
01:20:11.910 --> 01:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
much is
 
01:20:13.669 --> 01:20:13.679 align:start position:0%
too too much and i think some of the
 
01:20:15.990 --> 01:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
required reporting to the legislature
 
01:20:18.950 --> 01:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
would would address that yeah
 
01:20:21.350 --> 01:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
so are there other questions from the
 
01:20:24.310 --> 01:20:24.320 align:start position:0%
committee from chairman emerit chairman
 
01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:26.149 align:start position:0%
committee from chairman emerit chairman
umberger

01:20:26.149 --> 01:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
umberger
 
01:20:28.470 --> 01:20:28.480 align:start position:0%
is there anyone in the
 
01:20:30.229 --> 01:20:30.239 align:start position:0%
audience that
 
01:20:32.629 --> 01:20:32.639 align:start position:0%
wants to say something this is a working
 
01:20:35.350 --> 01:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
session and we're open
 
01:20:37.990 --> 01:20:38.000 align:start position:0%

01:21:23.910 --> 01:21:23.920 align:start position:0%
and and because i presumably the room's
 
01:21:25.830 --> 01:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
been reserved and we can just fall in on
 
01:21:27.030 --> 01:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
that right
 
01:21:31.350 --> 01:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:33.430 --> 01:21:33.440 align:start position:0%
thank you um as i recall chairman
 
01:21:36.229 --> 01:21:36.239 align:start position:0%
umberger invited the plaintiff's council
 
01:21:38.709 --> 01:21:38.719 align:start position:0%
to redraft this bill and i wondered if
 
01:21:40.229 --> 01:21:40.239 align:start position:0%
they had done so and if that was going
 
01:21:42.709 --> 01:21:42.719 align:start position:0%
to be presented today well it's not
 
01:21:43.990 --> 01:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
going to be presented today because
 
01:21:46.390 --> 01:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
they're not there but but what i what i
 
01:21:49.590 --> 01:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
heard the ag say and i i
 
01:21:51.430 --> 01:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
i don't mean to speak for them is that
 
01:21:53.669 --> 01:21:53.679 align:start position:0%
they have intentional stakeholder
 
01:21:56.229 --> 01:21:56.239 align:start position:0%
meetings with those folks and that they
 
01:21:58.390 --> 01:21:58.400 align:start position:0%
are working to collaborate
 
01:21:58.400 --> 01:21:59.270 align:start position:0%
are working to collaborate
on

01:21:59.270 --> 01:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:22:01.189 --> 01:22:01.199 align:start position:0%
an agreed-upon position that could be
 
01:22:03.830 --> 01:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
reflected in a potential amendment and i
 
01:22:05.910 --> 01:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
suppose when they bring that a potential
 
01:22:08.229 --> 01:22:08.239 align:start position:0%
amendment to us then the stakeholders
 
01:22:10.390 --> 01:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
will be here is my hope
 
01:22:13.110 --> 01:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
mr agee could you want to expand on that
 
01:22:14.790 --> 01:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
yeah i think that's correct
 
01:22:17.830 --> 01:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
representative i um the
 
01:22:19.990 --> 01:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
plaintiff's counsel is they have not
 
01:22:23.189 --> 01:22:23.199 align:start position:0%
provided a red line yet i think what in
 
01:22:25.350 --> 01:22:25.360 align:start position:0%
discussing this with them what what we
 
01:22:26.629 --> 01:22:26.639 align:start position:0%
thought would be most productive is that
 
01:22:28.709 --> 01:22:28.719 align:start position:0%
they would start by providing that to us
 
01:22:30.709 --> 01:22:30.719 align:start position:0%
and we'd sit down and see if we can get
 
01:22:32.470 --> 01:22:32.480 align:start position:0%
to a consensus
 
01:22:34.149 --> 01:22:34.159 align:start position:0%
product um
 
01:22:34.159 --> 01:22:34.950 align:start position:0%
product um
and

01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:22:37.110 --> 01:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
if we that would then be presented to
 
01:22:38.790 --> 01:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
you so it would be sort of a joint
 
01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:40.390 align:start position:0%
you so it would be sort of a joint
redline

01:22:40.390 --> 01:22:40.400 align:start position:0%
redline
 
01:22:42.149 --> 01:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
it may be that we don't get there or we
 
01:22:44.070 --> 01:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
agree on certain parts and they may come
 
01:22:46.709 --> 01:22:46.719 align:start position:0%
and present other proposed revisions
 
01:22:49.110 --> 01:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
that that we may not recommend but i
 
01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:50.229 align:start position:0%
that that we may not recommend but i
think

01:22:50.229 --> 01:22:50.239 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:22:51.510 --> 01:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
we thought it would be most productive
 
01:22:54.070 --> 01:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
to start with them providing that to us
 
01:22:55.669 --> 01:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
we can talk about it with them because
 
01:22:57.750 --> 01:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
we haven't seen any proposed specific
 
01:23:00.390 --> 01:23:00.400 align:start position:0%
proposed revisions yet and see if we can
 
01:23:01.990 --> 01:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
see if we can at least get to consensus
 
01:23:04.229 --> 01:23:04.239 align:start position:0%
on as much as possible before we come
 
01:23:06.790 --> 01:23:06.800 align:start position:0%
back before you that way we can reduce
 
01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:07.510 align:start position:0%
back before you that way we can reduce
the

01:23:07.510 --> 01:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:23:09.830 --> 01:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
the multiple versions of different
 
01:23:12.149 --> 01:23:12.159 align:start position:0%
sections of this that otherwise might be
 
01:23:13.270 --> 01:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
flying around
 
01:23:14.950 --> 01:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
and you're going to do all that by 7
 
01:23:17.189 --> 01:23:17.199 align:start position:0%

a very similar bill hb 250
 
01:34:52.550 --> 01:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
passed the house and senate in 2020
 
01:34:55.109 --> 01:34:55.119 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it was vetoed it should be
 
01:34:57.109 --> 01:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
noted however that governor sununu in
 
01:34:58.550 --> 01:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
his veto message
 
01:35:00.709 --> 01:35:00.719 align:start position:0%
voiced his strong support for an adult
 
01:35:03.109 --> 01:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
medicaid dental benefit and cited
 
01:35:05.510 --> 01:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
predicted covet-related shortfalls at
 
01:35:09.910 --> 01:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
that time as his reason for vetoing it
 
01:35:11.669 --> 01:35:11.679 align:start position:0%
a work group within

01:35:55.350 --> 01:35:55.360 align:start position:0%
maximum extent allowed under cms
 
01:35:58.070 --> 01:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
guidelines for those with family incomes
 
01:36:02.870 --> 01:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
of over 100 of the federal poverty level
 
01:36:04.629 --> 01:36:04.639 align:start position:0%
while a dental benefit will come with a
 
01:36:04.639 --> 01:36:06.070 align:start position:0%
while a dental benefit will come with a
cost

01:36:06.070 --> 01:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
cost
 
01:36:08.070 --> 01:36:08.080 align:start position:0%
you will see that over 70 percent will
 
01:36:09.990 --> 01:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
be picked up by the federal government
 
01:36:11.910 --> 01:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
and i had expected that there would be a
 
01:36:14.390 --> 01:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
revised fiscal note but i understand
 
01:36:17.350 --> 01:36:17.360 align:start position:0%
that that's not finalized
 
01:36:19.750 --> 01:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
but i will leave it to the people from
 
01:36:21.350 --> 01:36:21.360 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
01:36:23.270 --> 01:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
mr lippman and
 
01:36:25.830 --> 01:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
dr finney to talk about the financial
 
01:36:25.840 --> 01:36:28.149 align:start position:0%
dr finney to talk about the financial
picture

01:36:28.149 --> 01:36:28.159 align:start position:0%
picture
 
01:36:29.830 --> 01:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
in addition we expect that a dental
 
01:36:32.149 --> 01:36:32.159 align:start position:0%
benefit will result in significant cost
 
01:36:34.790 --> 01:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
savings with improved oral health people
 
01:36:37.430 --> 01:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
will be more likely
 
01:36:39.669 --> 01:36:39.679 align:start position:0%
to become employed and no longer need
 
01:36:41.189 --> 01:36:41.199 align:start position:0%
medicaid at all
 
01:36:43.350 --> 01:36:43.360 align:start position:0%
expensive emergency department visits
 
01:36:45.830 --> 01:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
will be reduced exacerbation of
 
01:36:48.070 --> 01:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
co-morbid conditions such as diabetes
 
01:36:50.229 --> 01:36:50.239 align:start position:0%
and heart disease will be reduced
 
01:36:52.149 --> 01:36:52.159 align:start position:0%
lessening the need for extensive and
 
01:36:55.030 --> 01:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
expensive medical care down the road
 
01:36:57.189 --> 01:36:57.199 align:start position:0%
a dental benefit for adult medicaid
 
01:37:00.229 --> 01:37:00.239 align:start position:0%
recipients has been a long time coming
 
01:37:02.229 --> 01:37:02.239 align:start position:0%
it is significant step in improving the
 
01:37:04.629 --> 01:37:04.639 align:start position:0%
oral health of our citizens
 
01:37:06.550 --> 01:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
we have pared down benefits and added
 
01:37:08.470 --> 01:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
cost sharing to encourage patients to
 
01:37:10.229 --> 01:37:10.239 align:start position:0%
take responsibility for their health
 
01:37:10.239 --> 01:37:11.350 align:start position:0%
take responsibility for their health
care

01:37:11.350 --> 01:37:11.360 align:start position:0%
care
 
01:37:13.590 --> 01:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
with what some would refer to
 
01:37:16.229 --> 01:37:16.239 align:start position:0%
as having skin in the game
 
01:37:18.229 --> 01:37:18.239 align:start position:0%
it has been supported by republicans and
 
01:37:21.189 --> 01:37:21.199 align:start position:0%
democrats alike house bill 103 as
 
01:37:23.830 --> 01:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
amended was recommend ought to pass by
 
01:37:25.750 --> 01:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
health and human services committee by a
 
01:37:27.990 --> 01:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
19-1 vote
 
01:37:29.990 --> 01:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
it passed the full house by nearly two
 
01:37:31.669 --> 01:37:31.679 align:start position:0%
to one margin
 
01:37:33.590 --> 01:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
we are getting close to making an adult
 
01:37:36.070 --> 01:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
and full benefit a reality a reality
 
01:37:38.149 --> 01:37:38.159 align:start position:0%
that will result in tens of thousands of
 
01:37:40.709 --> 01:37:40.719 align:start position:0%
granite staters living with less pain
 
01:37:42.390 --> 01:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
and more dignity
 
01:37:44.950 --> 01:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
thank you and please vote ought to pass
 
01:37:46.790 --> 01:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
when this bill comes to the full finance
 
01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:48.950 align:start position:0%
when this bill comes to the full finance
committee

01:37:48.950 --> 01:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:37:51.189 --> 01:37:51.199 align:start position:0%
do you literally mean not to pass as
 
01:37:53.430 --> 01:37:53.440 align:start position:0%
amended i do literally mean ought to
 
01:37:56.550 --> 01:37:56.560 align:start position:0%
pass as amended okay
 
01:37:59.030 --> 01:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
just to set up some context here
 
01:38:01.510 --> 01:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee
 
01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:02.790 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee
often

01:38:02.790 --> 01:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
often
 
01:38:05.830 --> 01:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
has has been viewed to defer completely
 
01:38:08.229 --> 01:38:08.239 align:start position:0%
to the policy committee in terms of the
 
01:38:10.950 --> 01:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
policy and that our job is
 
01:38:13.510 --> 01:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
primarily predominantly to look at the
 
01:38:16.229 --> 01:38:16.239 align:start position:0%
fiscal implications
 
01:38:19.430 --> 01:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
i by agreement mutual agreement with the
 
01:38:19.440 --> 01:38:20.390 align:start position:0%
i by agreement mutual agreement with the
chairman

01:38:20.390 --> 01:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:38:24.629 --> 01:38:24.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:27.830 --> 01:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
he he has said that he thinks it's fine
 
01:38:29.270 --> 01:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
if we look at
 
01:38:31.510 --> 01:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
the policy issue as you know in a
 
01:38:34.229 --> 01:38:34.239 align:start position:0%
rational way and and i've told him that
 
01:38:36.229 --> 01:38:36.239 align:start position:0%
i think hhs ought to be considering
 
01:38:38.149 --> 01:38:38.159 align:start position:0%
fiscal implications when it passes
 
01:38:40.629 --> 01:38:40.639 align:start position:0%
policy so so we don't have a hard
 
01:38:40.639 --> 01:38:42.310 align:start position:0%
policy so so we don't have a hard
firewall

01:38:42.310 --> 01:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
firewall
 
01:38:45.109 --> 01:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
um and with that uh i want to i want to
 
01:38:47.669 --> 01:38:47.679 align:start position:0%
just touch on a couple of issues
 
01:38:51.270 --> 01:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
in the bill itself um
 
01:38:55.189 --> 01:38:55.199 align:start position:0%
on on on page one
 
01:38:55.199 --> 01:38:56.310 align:start position:0%
on on on page one
line

01:38:56.310 --> 01:38:56.320 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:38:56.320 --> 01:38:57.669 align:start position:0%
line
five

01:38:57.669 --> 01:38:57.679 align:start position:0%
five
 
01:38:59.590 --> 01:38:59.600 align:start position:0%
are you with me
 
01:39:01.030 --> 01:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
it'll take you a second is this on the
 
01:39:03.669 --> 01:39:03.679 align:start position:0%
amendment or the actual bill it says as
 
01:39:06.950 --> 01:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
amended so i believe this is um
 
01:39:09.910 --> 01:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
the current version okay
 
01:39:15.510 --> 01:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:17.750 --> 01:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
and and this is also for dr finney i
 
01:39:20.070 --> 01:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
believe um and
 
01:39:22.070 --> 01:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
courtney what what was your last name
 
01:39:27.900 --> 01:39:27.910 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:27.910 --> 01:39:29.990 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:39:29.990 --> 01:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:39:31.189 --> 01:39:31.199 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:39:31.199 --> 01:39:32.229 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
um

01:39:32.229 --> 01:39:32.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:32.239 --> 01:39:32.950 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:39:32.950 --> 01:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:39:35.510 --> 01:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
so you all may have a role in
 
01:39:37.750 --> 01:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
in resolving this
 
01:39:39.590 --> 01:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
it says
 
01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:42.310 align:start position:0%
it says
that

01:39:42.310 --> 01:39:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:45.189 --> 01:39:45.199 align:start position:0%
restorative treatments for oral health
 
01:39:45.199 --> 01:39:46.629 align:start position:0%
restorative treatments for oral health
conditions

01:39:46.629 --> 01:39:46.639 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
01:39:49.430 --> 01:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
are less expensive than emergency care
 
01:39:51.430 --> 01:39:51.440 align:start position:0%
and prevent oral conditions from
 
01:39:53.990 --> 01:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
developing blah blah
 
01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:54.950 align:start position:0%
developing blah blah
so

01:39:54.950 --> 01:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:39:54.960 --> 01:39:55.669 align:start position:0%
so
i

01:39:55.669 --> 01:39:55.679 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:39:58.070 --> 01:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
want to just be really clear
 
01:40:01.189 --> 01:40:01.199 align:start position:0%
we we asked in the working group
 
01:40:02.950 --> 01:40:02.960 align:start position:0%
about the amount of money that we would
 
01:40:06.070 --> 01:40:06.080 align:start position:0%
save on emergency care and it was really
 
01:40:08.390 --> 01:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
a quite small number
 
01:40:12.229 --> 01:40:12.239 align:start position:0%
and i just don't want to mislead anyone
 
01:40:13.990 --> 01:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
with this statement
 
01:40:18.229 --> 01:40:18.239 align:start position:0%
and so i'm just wondering if if
 
01:40:20.550 --> 01:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro
 
01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:21.270 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro
and

01:40:21.270 --> 01:40:21.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:40:24.229 --> 01:40:24.239 align:start position:0%
ms morin and dr finney if
 
01:40:26.470 --> 01:40:26.480 align:start position:0%
if if you think that
 
01:40:28.470 --> 01:40:28.480 align:start position:0%
um if we deleted
 
01:40:31.109 --> 01:40:31.119 align:start position:0%
the the words on line five
 
01:40:33.910 --> 01:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
are less expensive than emergency care
 
01:40:36.550 --> 01:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
and just delete that
 
01:40:40.149 --> 01:40:40.159 align:start position:0%
so that we're not implying that that
 
01:40:41.510 --> 01:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
are you following me representative
 
01:40:43.669 --> 01:40:43.679 align:start position:0%
shapiro mr chairman i'm not finding
 
01:40:54.550 --> 01:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:13.669 --> 01:41:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:15.990 --> 01:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
so so all i'm trying to do is is make
 
01:41:18.070 --> 01:41:18.080 align:start position:0%
sure that our purpose statement is
 
01:41:21.669 --> 01:41:21.679 align:start position:0%
precise and and fully accurate and as
 
01:41:23.669 --> 01:41:23.679 align:start position:0%
written i i think it leaves the
 
01:41:23.679 --> 01:41:24.870 align:start position:0%
written i i think it leaves the
implication

01:41:24.870 --> 01:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
implication
 
01:41:27.350 --> 01:41:27.360 align:start position:0%
that we're we're going to be saving
 
01:41:29.109 --> 01:41:29.119 align:start position:0%
money overall in this program by
 
01:41:31.990 --> 01:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
reducing emergency dental care so so i'd
 
01:41:34.550 --> 01:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
like to propose that we we delete the
 
01:41:34.560 --> 01:41:35.510 align:start position:0%
like to propose that we we delete the
words

01:41:35.510 --> 01:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
words
 
01:41:38.629 --> 01:41:38.639 align:start position:0%
are less expensive than emergency care
 
01:41:38.639 --> 01:41:39.910 align:start position:0%
are less expensive than emergency care
and

01:41:39.910 --> 01:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:41:41.910 --> 01:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
and just have it go
 
01:41:47.350 --> 01:41:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:49.750 --> 01:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
prevent oral conditions from developing
 
01:41:54.070 --> 01:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:55.830 --> 01:41:55.840 align:start position:0%
do you do you see what i'm saying do you
 
01:41:58.070 --> 01:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
want to think about it or do you have a
 
01:41:58.080 --> 01:41:59.510 align:start position:0%
want to think about it or do you have a
response

01:41:59.510 --> 01:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
response
 
01:42:01.669 --> 01:42:01.679 align:start position:0%
i do see what you're saying and and
 
01:42:03.750 --> 01:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
during our just earlier discussions in
 
01:42:06.149 --> 01:42:06.159 align:start position:0%
our work group i think that the
 
01:42:09.189 --> 01:42:09.199 align:start position:0%
amounts of money that would be saved um
 
01:42:10.629 --> 01:42:10.639 align:start position:0%
as you said
 
01:42:14.390 --> 01:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
did not seem very impressive um
 
01:42:16.149 --> 01:42:16.159 align:start position:0%
however i think they were also very
 
01:42:20.629 --> 01:42:20.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:22.390 --> 01:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
i'm certainly willing to think about
 
01:42:24.470 --> 01:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
this i don't think it's a big deal but i
 
01:42:27.750 --> 01:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
i do think the general principle that um
 
01:42:30.310 --> 01:42:30.320 align:start position:0%
people coming to the emergency room
 
01:42:32.310 --> 01:42:32.320 align:start position:0%
that that care is much more expensive
 
01:42:34.709 --> 01:42:34.719 align:start position:0%
than ongoing preventive care yes sir i
 
01:42:37.109 --> 01:42:37.119 align:start position:0%
agree with you uh and i and i think the
 
01:42:39.030 --> 01:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
rest of that sentence carries that
 
01:42:41.990 --> 01:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
burden by by saying prevent oral
 
01:42:44.229 --> 01:42:44.239 align:start position:0%
conditions developing into more complex
 
01:42:46.310 --> 01:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
health conditions that would require
 
01:42:48.790 --> 01:42:48.800 align:start position:0%
medical care the er is among the medical
 
01:42:51.430 --> 01:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
care that we'd be preventing so i'd like
 
01:42:53.510 --> 01:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
to just strip out those words about the
 
01:42:55.669 --> 01:42:55.679 align:start position:0%
emergency room if if that's okay with
 
01:42:58.709 --> 01:42:58.719 align:start position:0%
you and i'll give you time to think okay
 
01:43:00.629 --> 01:43:00.639 align:start position:0%
i think i think at one point there was a
 
01:43:03.430 --> 01:43:03.440 align:start position:0%
thought that we would save so much money
 
01:43:05.510 --> 01:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
that this that this program wouldn't
 
01:43:07.350 --> 01:43:07.360 align:start position:0%
really cost money because it would save
 
01:43:08.550 --> 01:43:08.560 align:start position:0%
so much money elsewhere and that's
 
01:43:11.030 --> 01:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
certainly not the case right right i i
 
01:43:12.870 --> 01:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
think it turned out that
 
01:43:15.350 --> 01:43:15.360 align:start position:0%
the savings on the emergency room were
 
01:43:17.189 --> 01:43:17.199 align:start position:0%
approximately one-third of the
 
01:43:19.270 --> 01:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
administrative costs of the program
 
01:43:21.109 --> 01:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
which would make it kind of
 
01:43:22.950 --> 01:43:22.960 align:start position:0%
insignificant but
 
01:43:25.189 --> 01:43:25.199 align:start position:0%
uh all right so so then i'd like to move
 
01:43:28.070 --> 01:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
on to the second item
 
01:43:30.149 --> 01:43:30.159 align:start position:0%
and this maybe this is a dr fenney
 
01:43:32.790 --> 01:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
question um but i'll let you guys uh
 
01:43:32.800 --> 01:43:33.990 align:start position:0%
question um but i'll let you guys uh
decide

01:43:33.990 --> 01:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
decide
 
01:43:36.709 --> 01:43:36.719 align:start position:0%
uh it's on page two
 
01:43:40.390 --> 01:43:40.400 align:start position:0%
line 23 and 24
 
01:43:43.270 --> 01:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
and uh i i get what this paragraph is
 
01:43:46.950 --> 01:43:46.960 align:start position:0%
doing and i'm okay with it i i i even
 
01:43:49.830 --> 01:43:49.840 align:start position:0%
through smoking secession counseling
 
01:43:52.870 --> 01:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
but then it goes and other services as
 
01:43:55.270 --> 01:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
determined by the commissioner
 
01:43:57.510 --> 01:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
and so i just want to make sure that
 
01:43:59.590 --> 01:43:59.600 align:start position:0%
we're not
 
01:44:02.629 --> 01:44:02.639 align:start position:0%
opening up a back door to expansion of
 
01:44:06.390 --> 01:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
services without legislative approval
 
01:44:08.629 --> 01:44:08.639 align:start position:0%
i would defer to dr finney on that one
 
01:44:08.639 --> 01:44:09.669 align:start position:0%
i would defer to dr finney on that one
okay

01:44:09.669 --> 01:44:09.679 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:44:12.229 --> 01:44:12.239 align:start position:0%
dr doc so you can sit where you are
 
01:44:15.030 --> 01:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
sitting there representative and dr
 
01:44:16.950 --> 01:44:16.960 align:start position:0%
finney and mr lipman we've got like
 
01:44:19.350 --> 01:44:19.360 align:start position:0%
these intermediate tables if you want to
 
01:44:21.030 --> 01:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
just go sit in one of those and have
 
01:44:25.189 --> 01:44:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:27.270 --> 01:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
and miss morin if you want you've got
 
01:44:35.030 --> 01:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:37.109 --> 01:44:37.119 align:start position:0%
i i think the first thing that i would
 
01:44:40.149 --> 01:44:40.159 align:start position:0%
like to say about that classification of
 
01:44:42.070 --> 01:44:42.080 align:start position:0%
treatment diagnostic and preventive
 
01:44:42.080 --> 01:44:43.590 align:start position:0%
treatment diagnostic and preventive
services

01:44:43.590 --> 01:44:43.600 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:44:47.350 --> 01:44:47.360 align:start position:0%
is limited in scope so when you look at
 
01:44:50.550 --> 01:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
the coding that dental offices need to
 
01:44:50.560 --> 01:44:51.430 align:start position:0%
the coding that dental offices need to
use

01:44:51.430 --> 01:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
use
 
01:44:54.149 --> 01:44:54.159 align:start position:0%
to bill for services there is a very
 
01:44:57.189 --> 01:44:57.199 align:start position:0%
specific and limited scope of
 
01:44:59.590 --> 01:44:59.600 align:start position:0%
services that are included in those two
 
01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:01.030 align:start position:0%
services that are included in those two
areas

01:45:01.030 --> 01:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
areas
 
01:45:03.830 --> 01:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
so it's it's not
 
01:45:07.590 --> 01:45:07.600 align:start position:0%
it's not a place where you could add say
 
01:45:10.629 --> 01:45:10.639 align:start position:0%
more removable dentures or you couldn't
 
01:45:13.189 --> 01:45:13.199 align:start position:0%
add root canal treatment there
 
01:45:16.550 --> 01:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
because that is not restorative
 
01:45:18.310 --> 01:45:18.320 align:start position:0%
i mean it's not diagnostic and
 
01:45:18.320 --> 01:45:21.189 align:start position:0%
i mean it's not diagnostic and
preventive

01:45:21.189 --> 01:45:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:23.510 --> 01:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
okay so you're saying the other services
 
01:45:25.750 --> 01:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
is determined by the commissioner are
 
01:45:28.709 --> 01:45:28.719 align:start position:0%
bound by the purpose of this paragraph
 
01:45:30.950 --> 01:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
to limit it to diagnostic and preventive
 
01:45:34.229 --> 01:45:34.239 align:start position:0%
dental services correct
 
01:45:36.470 --> 01:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
do you agree with that mr lippman
 
01:45:38.070 --> 01:45:38.080 align:start position:0%
i you know they're the experts on the
 
01:45:40.070 --> 01:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
coding side but on the financial side i
 
01:45:41.750 --> 01:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
think there's two other checkpoints one
 
01:45:43.830 --> 01:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
is when we go for a budget allocation
 
01:45:46.310 --> 01:45:46.320 align:start position:0%
and two um when we bring a contract
 
01:45:49.109 --> 01:45:49.119 align:start position:0%
forward in terms of what's specified and
 
01:45:51.270 --> 01:45:51.280 align:start position:0%
amounts with the governor and council
 
01:45:53.109 --> 01:45:53.119 align:start position:0%
but i i
 
01:45:55.510 --> 01:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
defer to the
 
01:45:57.109 --> 01:45:57.119 align:start position:0%
folks across the table who are more
 
01:45:58.709 --> 01:45:58.719 align:start position:0%
familiar with what the coding limitation
 
01:46:01.590 --> 01:46:01.600 align:start position:0%
is so so i'm i'm happy with that that's
 
01:46:04.229 --> 01:46:04.239 align:start position:0%
fine thank you thank you uh both uh
 
01:46:04.239 --> 01:46:05.109 align:start position:0%
fine thank you thank you uh both uh
so

01:46:05.109 --> 01:46:05.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:46:08.950 --> 01:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:13.910 --> 01:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:15.510 --> 01:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
we're not going to start
 
01:46:18.390 --> 01:46:18.400 align:start position:0%
paying for care until 1 april 23. the
 
01:46:20.629 --> 01:46:20.639 align:start position:0%
effective date on on the last page
 
01:46:20.639 --> 01:46:21.590 align:start position:0%
effective date on on the last page
bottom

01:46:21.590 --> 01:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
bottom
 
01:46:23.750 --> 01:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
line says this effect this act shall
 
01:46:27.109 --> 01:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
take effect upon its passage i i think
 
01:46:29.350 --> 01:46:29.360 align:start position:0%
that's correct but have you guys thought
 
01:46:30.950 --> 01:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
about this effective date is that
 
01:46:34.550 --> 01:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:36.709 --> 01:46:36.719 align:start position:0%
you know normally it's like 60 days
 
01:46:38.870 --> 01:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
after the governor signs or
 
01:46:40.870 --> 01:46:40.880 align:start position:0%
i think probably the language reflects
 
01:46:43.270 --> 01:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
that it there's a in order to do this
 
01:46:45.430 --> 01:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
right and get all the planning and go
 
01:46:47.270 --> 01:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
for the waivers we need to be able to
 
01:46:49.910 --> 01:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
start to act at pretty quickly
 
01:46:51.590 --> 01:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
because there's a call for an rfi then
 
01:46:53.590 --> 01:46:53.600 align:start position:0%
we have to do an rfp then we have to
 
01:46:55.750 --> 01:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
actuarial studies i mean
 
01:46:58.149 --> 01:46:58.159 align:start position:0%
there's a small window assuming this
 
01:46:59.510 --> 01:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
ultimately got
 
01:46:59.520 --> 01:47:00.470 align:start position:0%
ultimately got
passed

01:47:00.470 --> 01:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
passed
 
01:47:02.550 --> 01:47:02.560 align:start position:0%
we have less than a year to implement it
 
01:47:03.830 --> 01:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
01:47:05.830 --> 01:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
there's a lot to be done it may not seem
 
01:47:08.149 --> 01:47:08.159 align:start position:0%
like a lot but there is a lot to be done
 
01:47:11.270 --> 01:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
so but if i'm not an expert on
 
01:47:13.750 --> 01:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
the point that you're saying in terms of
 
01:47:15.830 --> 01:47:15.840 align:start position:0%
legislative language i'd look to lba to
 
01:47:18.149 --> 01:47:18.159 align:start position:0%
see if they have any um
 
01:47:19.910 --> 01:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
suggestions there to tighten it up if
 
01:47:21.590 --> 01:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
that's what you're feeling needs to be
 
01:47:24.390 --> 01:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
done but yeah usually mr williams if he
 
01:47:26.070 --> 01:47:26.080 align:start position:0%
has a problem with something he'll jump
 
01:47:27.990 --> 01:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
on it but mr ripple do you have any
 
01:47:29.750 --> 01:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
thoughts on the way the effective date
 
01:47:31.830 --> 01:47:31.840 align:start position:0%
is laid out there i think the effective
 
01:47:33.910 --> 01:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
date is okay for the reasons henry
 
01:47:35.510 --> 01:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned there's a process that's being
 
01:47:37.109 --> 01:47:37.119 align:start position:0%
put in place so it makes sense that that
 
01:47:38.709 --> 01:47:38.719 align:start position:0%
would be the department would be able to
 
01:47:41.510 --> 01:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
engage in that process immediately
 
01:47:43.590 --> 01:47:43.600 align:start position:0%
the only thing i would say is section
 
01:47:45.830 --> 01:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
three the appropriation on page three as
 
01:47:47.030 --> 01:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
written that would be available
 
01:47:48.629 --> 01:47:48.639 align:start position:0%
immediately as well even though it might
 
01:47:50.550 --> 01:47:50.560 align:start position:0%
not be needed immediately
 
01:47:52.709 --> 01:47:52.719 align:start position:0%
um but again i think henry might have
 
01:47:54.709 --> 01:47:54.719 align:start position:0%
some commentary on how soon they would
 
01:47:55.910 --> 01:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
need that money
 
01:47:57.270 --> 01:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:47:59.910 --> 01:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
so i guess i guess i don't understand
 
01:48:02.310 --> 01:48:02.320 align:start position:0%
what the advantage would be to waiting
 
01:48:02.320 --> 01:48:03.750 align:start position:0%
what the advantage would be to waiting
60

01:48:03.750 --> 01:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
60
 
01:48:03.760 --> 01:48:04.390 align:start position:0%
60
i

01:48:04.390 --> 01:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:05.109 align:start position:0%
i
i

01:48:05.109 --> 01:48:05.119 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:48:07.510 --> 01:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
it isn't an issue of advantage from my
 
01:48:08.950 --> 01:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
perspective it's
 
01:48:10.550 --> 01:48:10.560 align:start position:0%
an issue of what works for the
 
01:48:13.350 --> 01:48:13.360 align:start position:0%
department and what works for the people
 
01:48:15.510 --> 01:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
who have to go transcribe this and put
 
01:48:18.149 --> 01:48:18.159 align:start position:0%
it into the rsas and stuff and that's
 
01:48:21.189 --> 01:48:21.199 align:start position:0%
why mr williams will often times he's
 
01:48:22.390 --> 01:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
the legal
 
01:48:23.990 --> 01:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
you know miss williams
 
01:48:25.590 --> 01:48:25.600 align:start position:0%
he'll often have a comment on the
 
01:48:27.910 --> 01:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
effective date so we can ask him about
 
01:48:30.629 --> 01:48:30.639 align:start position:0%
that yeah i i think i'm okay with it i
 
01:48:32.470 --> 01:48:32.480 align:start position:0%
just i just wanted to check because it's
 
01:48:33.830 --> 01:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
a little different
 
01:48:38.149 --> 01:48:38.159 align:start position:0%
and and i forgot to ask uh mr lipman dr
 
01:48:40.070 --> 01:48:40.080 align:start position:0%

introduce yourself for the record
 
01:48:43.600 --> 01:48:44.550 align:start position:0%
introduce yourself for the record
sure

01:48:44.550 --> 01:48:44.560 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:48:47.430 --> 01:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
henry lipman state's medicaid director
 
01:48:49.270 --> 01:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
i'm dr sarah finney i'm the state's

01:48:59.590 --> 01:48:59.600 align:start position:0%
courtney morin actuary at northeast
 
01:49:01.910 --> 01:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
delta dental i'm a fellow of the society
 
01:49:03.510 --> 01:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
of actuaries and a member of the
 
01:49:05.590 --> 01:49:05.600 align:start position:0%
american academy of actuaries
 
01:49:08.229 --> 01:49:08.239 align:start position:0%
and you participated on our work group
 
01:49:10.790 --> 01:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
that's correct yeah okay well uh uh
 
01:49:12.470 --> 01:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
thank you and
 
01:49:14.390 --> 01:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
representative irf i know i know you
 
01:49:16.470 --> 01:49:16.480 align:start position:0%
have a few financial questions so why
 
01:49:20.470 --> 01:49:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:21.990 --> 01:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
actually i do have a bunch but that's
 
01:49:23.750 --> 01:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
really what i want to get on to i just
 
01:49:25.030 --> 01:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to touch on what you were
 
01:49:26.870 --> 01:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
bringing up why not just take out the
 
01:49:29.109 --> 01:49:29.119 align:start position:0%
word and other services as determined by
 
01:49:35.270 --> 01:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:37.510 --> 01:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
i guess there are times when there might
 
01:49:38.550 --> 01:49:38.560 align:start position:0%
be a new
 
01:49:40.790 --> 01:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
sealant or or something that could get
 
01:49:43.510 --> 01:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
introduced clinically i think if if you
 
01:49:45.430 --> 01:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to tighten it up i would suggest
 
01:49:45.440 --> 01:49:46.709 align:start position:0%
wanted to tighten it up i would suggest
as

01:49:46.709 --> 01:49:46.719 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:49:48.709 --> 01:49:48.719 align:start position:0%
as defined as
 
01:49:50.950 --> 01:49:50.960 align:start position:0%
those uh preventative services as
 
01:49:52.629 --> 01:49:52.639 align:start position:0%
professionally in the
 
01:49:54.070 --> 01:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
the coding
 
01:49:54.080 --> 01:49:55.109 align:start position:0%
the coding
of

01:49:55.109 --> 01:49:55.119 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:49:57.270 --> 01:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure what the dental american
 
01:49:59.189 --> 01:49:59.199 align:start position:0%
academy of dental
 
01:50:01.910 --> 01:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
something to that effect
 
01:50:04.550 --> 01:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
i i i think what i would say speaking to
 
01:50:07.750 --> 01:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
the the code set um every year the
 
01:50:10.229 --> 01:50:10.239 align:start position:0%
american dental association reviews all
 
01:50:12.470 --> 01:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
of the dental codes they have a code
 
01:50:14.870 --> 01:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
committee a code maintenance committee
 
01:50:17.109 --> 01:50:17.119 align:start position:0%
sometimes they delete codes sometimes
 
01:50:19.430 --> 01:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
they add them and then sometimes they
 
01:50:21.910 --> 01:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
amend them with the wording
 
01:50:24.310 --> 01:50:24.320 align:start position:0%
and so that would be a situation but it
 
01:50:26.870 --> 01:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
would be with any of the codes that you
 
01:50:29.589 --> 01:50:29.599 align:start position:0%
know we might have to change something
 
01:50:32.470 --> 01:50:32.480 align:start position:0%
based on the code set changing
 
01:50:34.470 --> 01:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
is that a document or a location
 
01:50:36.149 --> 01:50:36.159 align:start position:0%
enactment that could be referenced
 
01:50:37.910 --> 01:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely yeah instead of just having
 
01:50:41.990 --> 01:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:44.390 --> 01:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
so if you if i could
 
01:50:45.910 --> 01:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
if you wanted to vote by the
 
01:50:47.830 --> 01:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner so the rules of engagement
 
01:50:50.229 --> 01:50:50.239 align:start position:0%
today is we're having a conversation
 
01:50:52.550 --> 01:50:52.560 align:start position:0%
colleagues talking to colleagues so just
 
01:50:54.790 --> 01:50:54.800 align:start position:0%
if everyone's just polite to each other
 
01:50:56.790 --> 01:50:56.800 align:start position:0%
then this will work out
 
01:50:58.790 --> 01:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
could i get the spelling of the name for
 
01:51:00.910 --> 01:51:00.920 align:start position:0%
the dentist
 
01:51:00.920 --> 01:51:02.629 align:start position:0%
the dentist
f-i-n-n-e

01:51:02.629 --> 01:51:02.639 align:start position:0%
f-i-n-n-e
 
01:51:02.639 --> 01:51:04.870 align:start position:0%
f-i-n-n-e
okay

01:51:04.870 --> 01:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:51:07.910 --> 01:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
thank you sarah with an h with an h yes
 
01:51:08.870 --> 01:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:51:11.430 --> 01:51:11.440 align:start position:0%
so are you suggesting that
 
01:51:14.709 --> 01:51:14.719 align:start position:0%
instead of listing the specific services
 
01:51:17.990 --> 01:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
that there's just a reference to the
 
01:51:20.470 --> 01:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
no so everything's fine up until and
 
01:51:21.750 --> 01:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
other services as a term by the
 
01:51:22.870 --> 01:51:22.880 align:start position:0%
commission rather than having that
 
01:51:24.310 --> 01:51:24.320 align:start position:0%
clause if that could that clause could
 
01:51:25.510 --> 01:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
just reference
 
01:51:27.910 --> 01:51:27.920 align:start position:0%
this must be a specific
 
01:51:29.270 --> 01:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
document that has these codes
 
01:51:31.510 --> 01:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
specifically related to the diagnostic
 
01:51:33.109 --> 01:51:33.119 align:start position:0%
and preventive dental services is that
 
01:51:35.990 --> 01:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
accurate yes so that could just
 
01:51:37.350 --> 01:51:37.360 align:start position:0%
identify that clause so i could actually
 
01:51:38.709 --> 01:51:38.719 align:start position:0%
look at it and read it and say okay i
 
01:51:40.390 --> 01:51:40.400 align:start position:0%
get what she's talking about right as
 
01:51:42.070 --> 01:51:42.080 align:start position:0%
opposed to the way now look the way i
 
01:51:43.270 --> 01:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
read this when i first read it i was
 
01:51:46.390 --> 01:51:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:49.270 --> 01:51:49.280 align:start position:0%
sorry but i was no i i understand your
 
01:51:51.350 --> 01:51:51.360 align:start position:0%
concern and it's a good question it's a
 
01:51:53.990 --> 01:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
very logical question but it's sort of
 
01:51:56.709 --> 01:51:56.719 align:start position:0%
self-containing um i think what i would
 
01:51:59.910 --> 01:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
suggest is that we could say um
 
01:52:03.030 --> 01:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
and other services as determined by
 
01:52:06.470 --> 01:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
annual updates of the cdt code set
 
01:52:08.550 --> 01:52:08.560 align:start position:0%
that'd be great okay
 
01:52:10.310 --> 01:52:10.320 align:start position:0%
and then you trailed off a little bit
 
01:52:11.830 --> 01:52:11.840 align:start position:0%
did you imply that there would be a
 
01:52:14.149 --> 01:52:14.159 align:start position:0%
range of codes that you would specify in
 
01:52:16.390 --> 01:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
the legislation or
 
01:52:18.470 --> 01:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
or you just refer to the overall uh
 
01:52:20.149 --> 01:52:20.159 align:start position:0%
manual of the coverage
 
01:52:23.189 --> 01:52:23.199 align:start position:0%
the um we refer to the overall code set
 
01:52:25.830 --> 01:52:25.840 align:start position:0%
it's cdt which is the codes of
 
01:52:28.709 --> 01:52:28.719 align:start position:0%
diagnostic terminology
 
01:52:31.669 --> 01:52:31.679 align:start position:0%
and that is what has to be used um both
 
01:52:34.149 --> 01:52:34.159 align:start position:0%
in private and public insurance in
 
01:52:36.790 --> 01:52:36.800 align:start position:0%
claiming you know it's a consistent use
 
01:52:39.669 --> 01:52:39.679 align:start position:0%
of codes for every single dentist yeah i
 
01:52:41.830 --> 01:52:41.840 align:start position:0%
i it almost feels like that would
 
01:52:44.629 --> 01:52:44.639 align:start position:0%
inadvertently make it more open to
 
01:52:46.950 --> 01:52:46.960 align:start position:0%
discretion than just leaving it as is
 
01:52:49.990 --> 01:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
because the overall code book has codes
 
01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:51.270 align:start position:0%
because the overall code book has codes
beyond

01:52:51.270 --> 01:52:51.280 align:start position:0%
beyond
 
01:52:53.750 --> 01:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
the the dental
 
01:52:55.350 --> 01:52:55.360 align:start position:0%
restoration and
 
01:52:56.709 --> 01:52:56.719 align:start position:0%
if i understood correctly she's going to
 
01:52:58.390 --> 01:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
reference the ones the code set related
 
01:52:59.990 --> 01:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
to diagnostic and preventive dental
 
01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:01.270 align:start position:0%
to diagnostic and preventive dental
services

01:53:01.270 --> 01:53:01.280 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:53:03.270 --> 01:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
within that manual within that within
 
01:53:06.310 --> 01:53:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:06.320 --> 01:53:08.870 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:53:08.870 --> 01:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:08.880 --> 01:53:09.669 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:53:09.669 --> 01:53:09.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:53:11.189 --> 01:53:11.199 align:start position:0%
so i'm surprised because i'm learning
 
01:53:14.709 --> 01:53:14.719 align:start position:0%
something here is is the code book
 
01:53:18.550 --> 01:53:18.560 align:start position:0%
so specific that there is a code book
 
01:53:20.629 --> 01:53:20.639 align:start position:0%
that only deals with diagnostic and
 
01:53:22.709 --> 01:53:22.719 align:start position:0%
preventive dental services
 
01:53:25.430 --> 01:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
i would think that that code book has
 
01:53:28.790 --> 01:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
a vast range of oral procedures okay let
 
01:53:30.310 --> 01:53:30.320 align:start position:0%
me give you a quick
 
01:53:33.430 --> 01:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
rundown on the cdt codes
 
01:53:37.109 --> 01:53:37.119 align:start position:0%
they they start with 0
 
01:53:39.189 --> 01:53:39.199 align:start position:0%
100 numbers
 
01:53:41.669 --> 01:53:41.679 align:start position:0%
then one thousand two thousand three
 
01:53:43.830 --> 01:53:43.840 align:start position:0%
thousand four thousand five thousand six
 
01:53:46.709 --> 01:53:46.719 align:start position:0%
thousand each of those thousands is a
 
01:53:48.950 --> 01:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
different category of service
 
01:53:51.589 --> 01:53:51.599 align:start position:0%
and so we can be very specific
 
01:53:55.830 --> 01:53:55.840 align:start position:0%
and assign one subset of the code set to
 
01:53:58.550 --> 01:53:58.560 align:start position:0%
each of these areas in the bill so let's
 
01:53:59.669 --> 01:53:59.679 align:start position:0%
do that
 
01:53:59.679 --> 01:54:01.669 align:start position:0%
do that
okay

01:54:01.669 --> 01:54:01.679 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:54:03.270 --> 01:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
so now if i might doesn't have another
 
01:54:05.350 --> 01:54:05.360 align:start position:0%
question for doctor you you can keep
 
01:54:08.149 --> 01:54:08.159 align:start position:0%
going you're on a roll
 
01:54:10.070 --> 01:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
for representative i'm sorry
 
01:54:11.910 --> 01:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
um and this relax relates not yet this
 
01:54:14.629 --> 01:54:14.639 align:start position:0%
is still about your testimony i i
 
01:54:16.629 --> 01:54:16.639 align:start position:0%
thought you referenced
 
01:54:16.639 --> 01:54:17.430 align:start position:0%
thought you referenced
uh

01:54:17.430 --> 01:54:17.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:54:21.669 --> 01:54:21.679 align:start position:0%
2019 law chapter law 3 4 three four six
 
01:54:22.629 --> 01:54:22.639 align:start position:0%
two two
 
01:54:24.310 --> 01:54:24.320 align:start position:0%
five is that did i understand correctly
 
01:54:25.589 --> 01:54:25.599 align:start position:0%
you actually brought that up because i
 
01:54:27.910 --> 01:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
have a question yeah well okay
 
01:54:29.350 --> 01:54:29.360 align:start position:0%
you kind of referenced it in the light
 
01:54:31.750 --> 01:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
of oh this is expanding upon that i
 
01:54:34.229 --> 01:54:34.239 align:start position:0%
think we should explicitly amend this
 
01:54:36.629 --> 01:54:36.639 align:start position:0%
bill to
 
01:54:37.990 --> 01:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
repeal that
 
01:54:39.030 --> 01:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
because i actually went and read that
 
01:54:41.189 --> 01:54:41.199 align:start position:0%
and it's a whole different
 
01:54:42.470 --> 01:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
approach to this
 
01:54:44.709 --> 01:54:44.719 align:start position:0%
i think what that what that bill did is
 
01:54:46.149 --> 01:54:46.159 align:start position:0%
it actually
 
01:54:48.470 --> 01:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
removed the prohibition
 
01:54:50.390 --> 01:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
of having an adult benefit
 
01:54:52.709 --> 01:54:52.719 align:start position:0%
it has date specific when it should be
 
01:54:55.510 --> 01:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
in effect and that date was a a year or
 
01:54:56.870 --> 01:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
more ago
 
01:54:58.709 --> 01:54:58.719 align:start position:0%
so i just think we should repeal that
 
01:55:00.870 --> 01:55:00.880 align:start position:0%
as part of this somewhere i'm sure mr uh
 
01:55:02.629 --> 01:55:02.639 align:start position:0%
uh ripple could
 
01:55:04.390 --> 01:55:04.400 align:start position:0%
come up that amendment to justice so
 
01:55:05.830 --> 01:55:05.840 align:start position:0%
that's gone and this will be the bill
 
01:55:05.840 --> 01:55:06.950 align:start position:0%
that's gone and this will be the bill
that

01:55:06.950 --> 01:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:55:08.149 --> 01:55:08.159 align:start position:0%
or the law
 
01:55:09.750 --> 01:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
that defines the uh
 
01:55:11.350 --> 01:55:11.360 align:start position:0%
medicaid dental benefit does that make
 
01:55:11.360 --> 01:55:12.950 align:start position:0%
medicaid dental benefit does that make
sense

01:55:12.950 --> 01:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
sense
 
01:55:15.750 --> 01:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:17.109 --> 01:55:17.119 align:start position:0%
if you really want to keep going i will
 
01:55:19.030 --> 01:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
but that was really okay
 
01:55:20.070 --> 01:55:20.080 align:start position:0%
now i gotta
 
01:55:29.589 --> 01:55:29.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:31.830 --> 01:55:31.840 align:start position:0%
so while you're doing that mr ripple are
 
01:55:33.350 --> 01:55:33.360 align:start position:0%
you catching all these notes so you
 
01:55:35.430 --> 01:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
could uh put together a draft amendment
 
01:55:37.430 --> 01:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
for the committee i have so far i think
 
01:55:39.270 --> 01:55:39.280 align:start position:0%
the only thing that i'm not quite clear
 
01:55:40.790 --> 01:55:40.800 align:start position:0%
on is the diagnostic and preventive
 
01:55:42.470 --> 01:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
dental services so
 
01:55:44.229 --> 01:55:44.239 align:start position:0%
that would read and other services as
 
01:55:47.109 --> 01:55:47.119 align:start position:0%
determined by i didn't catch the last
 
01:55:47.119 --> 01:55:48.390 align:start position:0%
determined by i didn't catch the last
part

01:55:48.390 --> 01:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
part
 
01:55:49.910 --> 01:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
so dr finney
 
01:55:51.030 --> 01:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
could you just
 
01:55:53.430 --> 01:55:53.440 align:start position:0%
uh send a quick email the way you would
 
01:55:55.750 --> 01:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
phrase it and and what the number range
 
01:55:58.310 --> 01:55:58.320 align:start position:0%
is that you're referring to to mr ripple
 
01:55:58.320 --> 01:55:59.510 align:start position:0%
is that you're referring to to mr ripple
yes

01:55:59.510 --> 01:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:56:02.870 --> 01:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:05.350 --> 01:56:05.360 align:start position:0%
and i guess my other question um with
 
01:56:08.550 --> 01:56:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:11.109 --> 01:56:11.119 align:start position:0%
eliminating the old april 1 2021
 
01:56:12.310 --> 01:56:12.320 align:start position:0%
requirement that was in the trailer
 
01:56:14.950 --> 01:56:14.960 align:start position:0%
build from 2019 would you want me to
 
01:56:14.960 --> 01:56:16.470 align:start position:0%
build from 2019 would you want me to
repeal

01:56:16.470 --> 01:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
repeal
 
01:56:19.669 --> 01:56:19.679 align:start position:0%
that entire provision or only the april
 
01:56:24.390 --> 01:56:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:25.910 --> 01:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
i'd like you to repeal the whole thing
 
01:56:25.920 --> 01:56:27.750 align:start position:0%
i'd like you to repeal the whole thing
okay

01:56:27.750 --> 01:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:56:30.870 --> 01:56:30.880 align:start position:0%
does that get rid of the work group
 
01:56:32.629 --> 01:56:32.639 align:start position:0%
it would get rid of the previous work
 
01:56:35.350 --> 01:56:35.360 align:start position:0%
group but i believe the bill
 
01:56:37.189 --> 01:56:37.199 align:start position:0%
before you house bill 103 would have the
 
01:56:46.229 --> 01:56:46.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:48.950 --> 01:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
i don't think it mentions a work group
 
01:56:52.070 --> 01:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
it mentions reporting now okay
 
01:56:53.910 --> 01:56:53.920 align:start position:0%
so actually yes you're correct that
 
01:56:56.070 --> 01:56:56.080 align:start position:0%
would get rid of the work group is the
 
01:56:58.149 --> 01:56:58.159 align:start position:0%
work group just a subsection of that
 
01:56:58.159 --> 01:56:59.270 align:start position:0%
work group just a subsection of that
chapter

01:56:59.270 --> 01:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
chapter
 
01:57:01.109 --> 01:57:01.119 align:start position:0%
could that just that one subsection be
 
01:57:03.109 --> 01:57:03.119 align:start position:0%
left and repeal the other bits because
 
01:57:05.750 --> 01:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
it actually does i only read it today i
 
01:57:07.510 --> 01:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
didn't really great detail but it seemed
 
01:57:10.310 --> 01:57:10.320 align:start position:0%
to describe an actual program
 
01:57:11.910 --> 01:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
it did
 
01:57:13.750 --> 01:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
i think the program piece would be good
 
01:57:15.750 --> 01:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
to remove so there's not two sets of
 
01:57:18.709 --> 01:57:18.719 align:start position:0%
programs in law i think the
 
01:57:20.709 --> 01:57:20.719 align:start position:0%
the allowance of a dental benefit and
 
01:57:21.990 --> 01:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
the work group
 
01:57:23.990 --> 01:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
maintaining those things are important
 
01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:24.870 align:start position:0%
maintaining those things are important
whether

01:57:24.870 --> 01:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
whether
 
01:57:26.390 --> 01:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
they get re
 
01:57:28.629 --> 01:57:28.639 align:start position:0%
recodified or remain
 
01:57:30.870 --> 01:57:30.880 align:start position:0%
as you suggested as a possibility
 
01:57:33.430 --> 01:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
okay i'm happy either way as long as the
 
01:57:36.149 --> 01:57:36.159 align:start position:0%
program is not
 
01:57:38.550 --> 01:57:38.560 align:start position:0%
there i just do not want to see the work
 
01:57:40.870 --> 01:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
group be removed because that's been a
 
01:57:43.510 --> 01:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
huge piece of us getting to this point
 
01:57:45.910 --> 01:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
and there's been a very wide array of
 
01:57:47.830 --> 01:57:47.840 align:start position:0%
stakeholders from around the state that
 
01:57:49.990 --> 01:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
have been involved in that and i i don't
 
01:57:51.669 --> 01:57:51.679 align:start position:0%
want to see that go away i think we need
 
01:57:53.830 --> 01:57:53.840 align:start position:0%
that moving forward don't want to kill
 
01:57:53.840 --> 01:57:54.790 align:start position:0%
that moving forward don't want to kill
that

01:57:54.790 --> 01:57:54.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:57:56.790 --> 01:57:56.800 align:start position:0%
so i think in that case
 
01:57:57.910 --> 01:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
the 29
 
01:58:00.229 --> 01:58:00.239 align:start position:0%
2019 trailer bill said it established
 
01:58:01.990 --> 01:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
the working group then it went on to say
 
01:58:03.430 --> 01:58:03.440 align:start position:0%
the adult dental benefit shall become
 
01:58:06.229 --> 01:58:06.239 align:start position:0%
effective on april 1st 2021. each plan
 
01:58:08.070 --> 01:58:08.080 align:start position:0%
shall include at a minimum a detailed
 
01:58:09.589 --> 01:58:09.599 align:start position:0%
description of the following and it went
 
01:58:11.750 --> 01:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
on to say what the proposed plan should
 
01:58:11.760 --> 01:58:13.589 align:start position:0%
on to say what the proposed plan should
include

01:58:13.589 --> 01:58:13.599 align:start position:0%
include
 
01:58:14.870 --> 01:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
i could
 
01:58:20.709 --> 01:58:20.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:22.790 --> 01:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
each plan shall include
 
01:58:24.390 --> 01:58:24.400 align:start position:0%
until the end of that section so the
 
01:58:30.070 --> 01:58:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:31.990 --> 01:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
and remove everything from the adult
 
01:58:33.589 --> 01:58:33.599 align:start position:0%
dental benefit shall become effective on
 
01:58:35.669 --> 01:58:35.679 align:start position:0%
april 1st 2021 through the end of that
 
01:58:37.270 --> 01:58:37.280 align:start position:0%
section and this might be easier if you
 
01:58:38.550 --> 01:58:38.560 align:start position:0%
could see what i'm reading too so if
 
01:58:39.910 --> 01:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
you'd like i could print this out and
 
01:58:45.030 --> 01:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:47.350 --> 01:58:47.360 align:start position:0%
i can see it but if the rest wanted that
 
01:58:49.830 --> 01:58:49.840 align:start position:0%
would be helpful to me okay let me know
 
01:58:51.189 --> 01:58:51.199 align:start position:0%
what you're doing
 
01:58:52.709 --> 01:58:52.719 align:start position:0%
do you want us to recess for five
 
01:58:54.950 --> 01:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
minutes so you can do that is that what
 
01:58:58.229 --> 01:58:58.239 align:start position:0%
you're thinking sure okay um
 
01:59:00.709 --> 01:59:00.719 align:start position:0%
so uh we're going to stand in recess
 
01:59:05.189 --> 01:59:05.199 align:start position:0%
it's 2 58 now we'll reconvene at 3.05
 
01:59:43.109 --> 01:59:43.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:43.119 --> 02:00:02.709 align:start position:0%
 
of okay

02:00:02.709 --> 02:00:02.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:39.589 --> 02:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:42.950 --> 02:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
let um get their own choppers right
 
02:01:04.950 --> 02:01:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:04.960 --> 02:01:20.629 align:start position:0%
 
no

02:01:20.629 --> 02:01:20.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:24.310 --> 02:01:24.320 align:start position:0%
how many of them ask for no no
 
02:01:26.070 --> 02:01:26.080 align:start position:0%
not to be thrown out and quit paying
 
02:01:26.080 --> 02:01:27.669 align:start position:0%
not to be thrown out and quit paying
rent

02:01:27.669 --> 02:01:27.679 align:start position:0%
rent
 
02:02:02.790 --> 02:02:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:19.589 --> 02:02:19.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:19.599 --> 02:02:20.790 align:start position:0%
 
courtney

02:02:20.790 --> 02:02:20.800 align:start position:0%
courtney
 
02:02:23.350 --> 02:02:23.360 align:start position:0%
do you do you participate in auburn's
 
02:02:25.430 --> 02:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
deliberative sessions do you go in and
 
02:02:32.709 --> 02:02:32.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:34.629 --> 02:02:34.639 align:start position:0%
they're kind of interesting
 
02:02:36.470 --> 02:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
yeah they're sort of
 
02:02:39.270 --> 02:02:39.280 align:start position:0%
run like many legislatures
 
02:02:41.589 --> 02:02:41.599 align:start position:0%
where you know warrants and stuff get
 
02:02:43.189 --> 02:02:43.199 align:start position:0%
debated and
 
02:02:45.669 --> 02:02:45.679 align:start position:0%
people propose amendments and it's sort
 
02:02:48.070 --> 02:02:48.080 align:start position:0%
of interesting
 
02:02:50.390 --> 02:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
never seen anything like it i've lived
 
02:02:52.229 --> 02:02:52.239 align:start position:0%
in a lot of different places i've never
 
02:02:55.830 --> 02:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:57.990 --> 02:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
the town basically forms its own general
 
02:03:01.990 --> 02:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:07.430 --> 02:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:08.709 --> 02:03:08.719 align:start position:0%
that's what they do in many other
 
02:03:08.719 --> 02:03:11.830 align:start position:0%
that's what they do in many other
countries

02:03:11.830 --> 02:03:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:11.840 --> 02:03:12.790 align:start position:0%
 
but

02:03:12.790 --> 02:03:12.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:03:12.800 --> 02:03:22.950 align:start position:0%
but
we've

02:03:22.950 --> 02:03:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:28.550 --> 02:03:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:31.109 --> 02:03:31.119 align:start position:0%
it was a very snowy day when i first
 
02:03:32.390 --> 02:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
pulled in
 
02:03:33.990 --> 02:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
because i didn't i didn't know anything
 
02:03:36.070 --> 02:03:36.080 align:start position:0%
about new hampshire snow and it snowed
 
02:03:38.870 --> 02:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
like two feet
 
02:03:40.709 --> 02:03:40.719 align:start position:0%
my driveway it was
 
02:03:42.790 --> 02:03:42.800 align:start position:0%
just packed
 
02:03:44.070 --> 02:03:44.080 align:start position:0%
got stuck
 
02:03:45.990 --> 02:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
that's great
 
02:03:47.669 --> 02:03:47.679 align:start position:0%
welcome to new hampshire you're stuck in
 
02:03:51.589 --> 02:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:54.310 --> 02:03:54.320 align:start position:0%
we had been living in a suburb of
 
02:03:58.229 --> 02:03:58.239 align:start position:0%
rochester new york and um our daughters
 
02:04:00.149 --> 02:04:00.159 align:start position:0%
had both gotten far enough through the
 
02:04:01.990 --> 02:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
college process that we knew they were
 
02:04:05.189 --> 02:04:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:05.199 --> 02:04:06.069 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:04:06.069 --> 02:04:06.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:04:08.149 --> 02:04:08.159 align:start position:0%
it was it was one of those mcmansion
 
02:04:11.430 --> 02:04:11.440 align:start position:0%
things where
 
02:04:14.229 --> 02:04:14.239 align:start position:0%
i i kind of realized we had to move
 
02:04:14.239 --> 02:04:15.350 align:start position:0%
i i kind of realized we had to move
somewhere

02:04:15.350 --> 02:04:15.360 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
02:04:18.310 --> 02:04:18.320 align:start position:0%
when i was walking through the house and
 
02:04:20.229 --> 02:04:20.239 align:start position:0%
i noticed that there was a room with a
 
02:04:22.870 --> 02:04:22.880 align:start position:0%
piano and a nice couch and we were
 
02:04:25.350 --> 02:04:25.360 align:start position:0%
calling it the dog room because only the
 
02:04:27.189 --> 02:04:27.199 align:start position:0%
dogs would go in there
 
02:04:27.199 --> 02:04:28.390 align:start position:0%
dogs would go in there
right

02:04:28.390 --> 02:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:04:29.830 --> 02:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
and and they weren't going to learn how
 
02:04:32.790 --> 02:04:32.800 align:start position:0%
to play the piano so i thought you know
 
02:04:35.990 --> 02:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
part of this is really wasteful
 
02:04:38.950 --> 02:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
so we just bought a a house we bought on
 
02:04:40.790 --> 02:04:40.800 align:start position:0%
rattlesnake was just meant to be for my
 
02:04:45.910 --> 02:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:48.310 --> 02:04:48.320 align:start position:0%
made us you know
 
02:04:50.310 --> 02:04:50.320 align:start position:0%
pardon me like with a pasaki rattlesnake
 
02:04:53.270 --> 02:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
or uh no no no no just we're of the
 
02:05:01.830 --> 02:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:03.589 --> 02:05:03.599 align:start position:0%
so do you have a stuffed rattlesnake
 
02:05:19.109 --> 02:05:19.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:22.069 --> 02:05:22.079 align:start position:0%
no they claim that there was a mill
 
02:05:23.430 --> 02:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
along a river
 
02:05:25.589 --> 02:05:25.599 align:start position:0%
yeah that you know and there was a lot
 
02:05:27.589 --> 02:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
of sawdust and stuff and people claimed
 
02:05:29.030 --> 02:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
that there were rattlesnakes in the
 
02:05:31.510 --> 02:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
under that mill
 
02:05:31.520 --> 02:05:32.390 align:start position:0%
under that mill

02:05:32.390 --> 02:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
ralph's
 
02:05:32.400 --> 02:05:45.350 align:start position:0%
ralph's
rare

02:05:45.350 --> 02:05:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:48.790 --> 02:05:48.800 align:start position:0%
in the mud or in the weeds
 
02:06:05.270 --> 02:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:05.280 --> 02:06:06.310 align:start position:0%
 
well

02:06:06.310 --> 02:06:06.320 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:06:07.910 --> 02:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
joe's been
 
02:06:14.550 --> 02:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:24.149 --> 02:06:24.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:25.350 --> 02:06:25.360 align:start position:0%
kevin was
 
02:06:27.109 --> 02:06:27.119 align:start position:0%
doing stuff in there he was just having
 
02:06:40.870 --> 02:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:43.270 --> 02:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
so we're going to stay on recess until
 
02:06:49.589 --> 02:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:51.270 --> 02:06:51.280 align:start position:0%
and i say that because we're still being
 
02:06:51.280 --> 02:07:23.030 align:start position:0%
and i say that because we're still being
recorded

02:07:23.030 --> 02:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:35.669 --> 02:07:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:35.679 --> 02:08:04.310 align:start position:0%
 
224

02:08:04.310 --> 02:08:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:15.830 --> 02:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:18.470 --> 02:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
well i just looked at 692. it's in there
 
02:08:20.790 --> 02:08:20.800 align:start position:0%
and it was signed right
 
02:08:22.790 --> 02:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
there is the repeal i think just want to
 
02:08:24.550 --> 02:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
make sure that they're repealing the old
 
02:08:27.270 --> 02:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
one that they don't repeal the appeal
 
02:08:27.280 --> 02:08:27.990 align:start position:0%
one that they don't repeal the appeal
right

02:08:27.990 --> 02:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:08:30.069 --> 02:08:30.079 align:start position:0%
but we're only talking about
 
02:08:31.910 --> 02:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
revealing something from house bill 4
 
02:08:35.910 --> 02:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
not from 692. i think 692 was actually
 
02:08:38.950 --> 02:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
replaced by houseboat oh okay paying
 
02:08:38.960 --> 02:08:40.229 align:start position:0%
replaced by houseboat oh okay paying
attention

02:08:40.229 --> 02:08:40.239 align:start position:0%
attention
 
02:08:40.239 --> 02:08:42.069 align:start position:0%
attention
yeah

02:08:42.069 --> 02:08:42.079 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:08:43.830 --> 02:08:43.840 align:start position:0%
forward because there was an agreement
 
02:08:45.350 --> 02:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
on the budget and
 
02:08:47.830 --> 02:08:47.840 align:start position:0%
then that was subsequently handled so i
 
02:08:50.229 --> 02:08:50.239 align:start position:0%
think you left me a voicemail saying uh
 
02:08:54.790 --> 02:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
our auto pay number was uh declined
 
02:09:15.270 --> 02:09:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:19.270 --> 02:09:19.280 align:start position:0%
it's 0 8 25.
 
02:09:19.280 --> 02:09:24.149 align:start position:0%
it's 0 8 25.
kevin

02:09:24.149 --> 02:09:24.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:30.629 --> 02:09:30.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:32.629 --> 02:09:32.639 align:start position:0%
i think it i think
 
02:09:36.470 --> 02:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
in 692 it explicitly said it repealed it
 
02:09:38.069 --> 02:09:38.079 align:start position:0%
i mean it's used
 
02:09:40.149 --> 02:09:40.159 align:start position:0%
but in this one it just says that it
 
02:09:42.550 --> 02:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
will create an adult
 
02:10:11.430 --> 02:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:13.430 --> 02:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
the first full sentence which ends right
 
02:10:13.440 --> 02:10:17.669 align:start position:0%
the first full sentence which ends right
there

02:10:17.669 --> 02:10:17.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:23.189 --> 02:10:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:23.199 --> 02:10:23.910 align:start position:0%
 
10

02:10:23.910 --> 02:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
10
 
02:10:23.920 --> 02:10:24.870 align:start position:0%
10
pages

02:10:24.870 --> 02:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
pages
 
02:10:41.109 --> 02:10:41.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:43.830 --> 02:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
yes all right so
 
02:10:48.149 --> 02:10:48.159 align:start position:0%
the working session on hb 103 fn is uh
 
02:10:51.350 --> 02:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
is now back in session
 
02:10:51.360 --> 02:10:52.149 align:start position:0%
is now back in session
so

02:10:52.149 --> 02:10:52.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:10:55.669 --> 02:10:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:58.149 --> 02:10:58.159 align:start position:0%
handed us all a paper
 
02:11:00.149 --> 02:11:00.159 align:start position:0%
uh do you do you want to talk through
 
02:11:01.990 --> 02:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
this what what you want us to see on
 
02:11:03.830 --> 02:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
here uh yup this is just a portion of
 
02:11:06.229 --> 02:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
the trailer bill from 2019 and on the
 
02:11:08.470 --> 02:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
first page which is page 77 starting on
 
02:11:09.750 --> 02:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
line seven
 
02:11:11.270 --> 02:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
you can see the provisions that relate
 
02:11:12.950 --> 02:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
to the dental benefit and the working
 
02:11:14.390 --> 02:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
group that initially would have
 
02:11:16.229 --> 02:11:16.239 align:start position:0%
established it and that goes on to the
 
02:11:18.629 --> 02:11:18.639 align:start position:0%
next page on line 13. so i think the
 
02:11:20.550 --> 02:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
question is what which aspect of this
 
02:11:22.830 --> 02:11:22.840 align:start position:0%
you want to repeal in the current
 
02:11:22.840 --> 02:11:24.629 align:start position:0%
you want to repeal in the current
bill

02:11:24.629 --> 02:11:24.639 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:11:26.390 --> 02:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
i think the two things that we want to
 
02:11:31.430 --> 02:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:33.430 --> 02:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
shall develop a plan for the
 
02:11:35.750 --> 02:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
incorporation of an adult dental benefit
 
02:11:38.149 --> 02:11:38.159 align:start position:0%
establishing an adult dental benefit and
 
02:11:43.430 --> 02:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:46.310 --> 02:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
so so what to say it differently uh what
 
02:11:46.320 --> 02:11:47.350 align:start position:0%
so so what to say it differently uh what
lines

02:11:47.350 --> 02:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
lines
 
02:11:49.510 --> 02:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro do you see us
 
02:11:49.520 --> 02:12:00.790 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro do you see us
deleting

02:12:00.790 --> 02:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:05.030 --> 02:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:06.950 --> 02:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
and after
 
02:12:09.189 --> 02:12:09.199 align:start position:0%
page 26
 
02:12:09.199 --> 02:12:11.350 align:start position:0%
page 26
okay

02:12:11.350 --> 02:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:12:11.360 --> 02:12:12.870 align:start position:0%
okay
so

02:12:12.870 --> 02:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:12:14.550 --> 02:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
what representative earth is is
 
02:12:17.510 --> 02:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
mentioning is lines 7 through 11
 
02:12:18.950 --> 02:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
to be eliminated
 
02:12:21.990 --> 02:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
and then go down to line 26
 
02:12:24.069 --> 02:12:24.079 align:start position:0%
and after 91a
 
02:12:25.990 --> 02:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
from that sentence down the rest of the
 
02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.149 align:start position:0%
from that sentence down the rest of the
page

02:12:28.149 --> 02:12:28.159 align:start position:0%
page
 
02:12:29.910 --> 02:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
and the next page
 
02:12:31.830 --> 02:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
and that same section should be
 
02:12:31.840 --> 02:12:35.830 align:start position:0%
and that same section should be
eliminated

02:12:35.830 --> 02:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:38.870 --> 02:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
so i i gotta admit i'm confused i
 
02:12:42.149 --> 02:12:42.159 align:start position:0%
seeing what is there now
 
02:12:58.629 --> 02:12:58.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:01.270 --> 02:13:01.280 align:start position:0%
so i'll say what i i think we're wanting
 
02:13:04.470 --> 02:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
to do we're and then anyone can correct
 
02:13:04.480 --> 02:13:05.350 align:start position:0%
to do we're and then anyone can correct
me

02:13:05.350 --> 02:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
me
 
02:13:08.950 --> 02:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
we want on page 77
 
02:13:12.149 --> 02:13:12.159 align:start position:0%
to start deleting from line seven
 
02:13:15.350 --> 02:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
all the way through line 11.
 
02:13:18.310 --> 02:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
then we want to drop
 
02:13:21.910 --> 02:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
down to line 26
 
02:13:25.350 --> 02:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
afterwards says rsa 91a
 
02:13:28.229 --> 02:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
we want to begin deleting the department
 
02:13:30.229 --> 02:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
in consultation with the working group
 
02:13:30.239 --> 02:13:31.270 align:start position:0%
in consultation with the working group
shall

02:13:31.270 --> 02:13:31.280 align:start position:0%
shall
 
02:13:32.149 --> 02:13:32.159 align:start position:0%
and then
 
02:13:34.550 --> 02:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
that all gets deleted from that point
 
02:13:38.229 --> 02:13:38.239 align:start position:0%
through line 36.
 
02:13:41.910 --> 02:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
then when we go to page 78
 
02:13:43.510 --> 02:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
we are deleting
 
02:13:47.750 --> 02:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
lines 1 through 13.
 
02:13:52.950 --> 02:13:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:54.629 --> 02:13:54.639 align:start position:0%
one two okay
 
02:13:56.709 --> 02:13:56.719 align:start position:0%
so we'll keep the reports so everything
 
02:14:00.310 --> 02:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:02.870 --> 02:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
mr ripple yep
 
02:14:06.629 --> 02:14:06.639 align:start position:0%
is 346 colon 226 part of the same 2019
 
02:14:15.910 --> 02:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:18.550 --> 02:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
get deleted i would think that we might
 
02:14:19.910 --> 02:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
want to keep
 
02:14:19.920 --> 02:14:21.589 align:start position:0%
want to keep
um

02:14:21.589 --> 02:14:21.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:24.149 --> 02:14:24.159 align:start position:0%
line seven eight and nine up to the word
 
02:14:25.510 --> 02:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
platform on
 
02:14:27.270 --> 02:14:27.280 align:start position:0%
line nine
 
02:14:29.189 --> 02:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
because that's really
 
02:14:30.629 --> 02:14:30.639 align:start position:0%
language from that bill which is
 
02:14:33.990 --> 02:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
established are you on page 77 or 17 77
 
02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:35.430 align:start position:0%
established are you on page 77 or 17 77
okay

02:14:35.430 --> 02:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:14:37.990 --> 02:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
okay so you're right
 
02:14:41.189 --> 02:14:41.199 align:start position:0%
seven through 11. yes up to the word
 
02:14:41.199 --> 02:14:42.229 align:start position:0%
seven through 11. yes up to the word
platf

02:14:42.229 --> 02:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
platf
 
02:14:44.790 --> 02:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
up till after the word platform so on
 
02:14:46.950 --> 02:14:46.960 align:start position:0%
line nine right
 
02:14:50.470 --> 02:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
so you recommend keeping lines seven
 
02:14:53.030 --> 02:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
eight and nine through the word platform
 
02:14:54.629 --> 02:14:54.639 align:start position:0%
just because that's the language that
 
02:14:58.390 --> 02:14:58.400 align:start position:0%
establishes an adult dental benefit
 
02:14:58.400 --> 02:14:59.510 align:start position:0%
establishes an adult dental benefit
so

02:14:59.510 --> 02:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:14:59.520 --> 02:15:05.990 align:start position:0%
so
repetitious

02:15:05.990 --> 02:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:08.390 --> 02:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
it's repetitious in what way um
 
02:15:10.470 --> 02:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
representative weiler it's
 
02:15:12.229 --> 02:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
in the new bill
 
02:15:14.709 --> 02:15:14.719 align:start position:0%
okay because we're about to try to pass
 
02:15:15.910 --> 02:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
a new bill
 
02:15:17.589 --> 02:15:17.599 align:start position:0%
we're saying that this is no longer
 
02:15:17.599 --> 02:15:18.870 align:start position:0%
we're saying that this is no longer
needed

02:15:18.870 --> 02:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
needed
 
02:15:20.709 --> 02:15:20.719 align:start position:0%
do you how do you respond to that
 
02:15:26.229 --> 02:15:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:28.069 --> 02:15:28.079 align:start position:0%
i mean we are trying to pass the bill
 
02:15:29.990 --> 02:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
right i guess this won't go through
 
02:15:32.709 --> 02:15:32.719 align:start position:0%
unless the bill gets passed so right so
 
02:15:35.510 --> 02:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
if we don't pass the bill in this states
 
02:15:35.520 --> 02:15:36.229 align:start position:0%
if we don't pass the bill in this states
right

02:15:36.229 --> 02:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:15:39.109 --> 02:15:39.119 align:start position:0%
i'm just worried about losing that um
 
02:15:41.350 --> 02:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
repealing the prohibition about
 
02:15:43.910 --> 02:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
about not having an adult benefit but
 
02:15:43.920 --> 02:15:44.709 align:start position:0%
about not having an adult benefit but
this

02:15:44.709 --> 02:15:44.719 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:15:47.270 --> 02:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
this will not be included this will not
 
02:15:49.189 --> 02:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
happen unless the bill goes through in
 
02:15:51.109 --> 02:15:51.119 align:start position:0%
his past so i think that would be fine
 
02:15:51.119 --> 02:15:51.910 align:start position:0%
his past so i think that would be fine
okay

02:15:51.910 --> 02:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:15:54.550 --> 02:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
dr finney do you do you agree do you
 
02:15:54.560 --> 02:15:56.149 align:start position:0%
dr finney do you do you agree do you
have

02:15:56.149 --> 02:15:56.159 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:15:57.830 --> 02:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
this can be a little confusing jumping
 
02:15:59.750 --> 02:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
around like this are you tracking and
 
02:16:09.030 --> 02:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:09.040 --> 02:16:10.310 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

02:16:10.310 --> 02:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
02:16:12.709 --> 02:16:12.719 align:start position:0%
it was originally
 
02:16:15.430 --> 02:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
meant to be in value-based care
 
02:16:17.669 --> 02:16:17.679 align:start position:0%
and that is
 
02:16:19.589 --> 02:16:19.599 align:start position:0%
stated in the current
 
02:16:22.629 --> 02:16:22.639 align:start position:0%
um legislation yeah i could have sworn i
 
02:16:25.750 --> 02:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
read value-based care in hb 103.
 
02:16:27.750 --> 02:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
right so we're good that's that was the
 
02:16:29.589 --> 02:16:29.599 align:start position:0%
only thing that you're happy then i'm
 
02:16:32.389 --> 02:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:34.070 --> 02:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
just after it's sort of put together
 
02:16:35.669 --> 02:16:35.679 align:start position:0%
just like to run it by john williams to
 
02:16:36.790 --> 02:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
make sure
 
02:16:39.190 --> 02:16:39.200 align:start position:0%
i like to run it by john williams after
 
02:16:41.349 --> 02:16:41.359 align:start position:0%
we pull something together in final form
 
02:16:42.549 --> 02:16:42.559 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
02:16:45.750 --> 02:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
so so mr ripple just just so we're we're
 
02:16:47.509 --> 02:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
tracking would you would you tell us
 
02:16:50.309 --> 02:16:50.319 align:start position:0%
what what we you think we just said
 
02:16:53.669 --> 02:16:53.679 align:start position:0%
about page 77 and 78 yep so i think on
 
02:16:56.950 --> 02:16:56.960 align:start position:0%
page 77 uh we would remove lines 7
 
02:16:58.709 --> 02:16:58.719 align:start position:0%
through 11. obviously that would
 
02:17:00.790 --> 02:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
necessitate renumbering and also ols
 
02:17:02.790 --> 02:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
might want to come up with a new uh
 
02:17:04.549 --> 02:17:04.559 align:start position:0%
section name for what would be the new
 
02:17:06.629 --> 02:17:06.639 align:start position:0%
225 but effectively you would remove the
 
02:17:09.910 --> 02:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
substance of lines 7 through 11.
 
02:17:12.549 --> 02:17:12.559 align:start position:0%
and then on page 78
 
02:17:14.629 --> 02:17:14.639 align:start position:0%
would you go down the rest of the page
 
02:17:14.639 --> 02:17:15.910 align:start position:0%
would you go down the rest of the page
77

02:17:15.910 --> 02:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
77
 
02:17:18.469 --> 02:17:18.479 align:start position:0%
because we still think you're at 27. yep
 
02:17:23.190 --> 02:17:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:28.070 --> 02:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:30.549 --> 02:17:30.559 align:start position:0%
uh from line 26 through the end of the
 
02:17:30.559 --> 02:17:31.509 align:start position:0%
uh from line 26 through the end of the
page

02:17:31.509 --> 02:17:31.519 align:start position:0%
page
 
02:17:32.950 --> 02:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
everything that begins with the
 
02:17:34.469 --> 02:17:34.479 align:start position:0%
department in consultation with the
 
02:17:37.990 --> 02:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
working group yes okay and then what and
 
02:17:41.990 --> 02:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:45.910 --> 02:17:45.920 align:start position:0%
you would delete lines 1 through 13. yes
 
02:17:46.870 --> 02:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:17:47.910 --> 02:17:47.920 align:start position:0%
so i
 
02:17:49.589 --> 02:17:49.599 align:start position:0%
i think we're in agreement
 
02:17:51.910 --> 02:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
on what we think we're going to do and
 
02:17:54.230 --> 02:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
we stipulate that the department will
 
02:17:56.549 --> 02:17:56.559 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity to run it by mr
 
02:17:56.559 --> 02:17:57.669 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity to run it by mr
williams

02:17:57.669 --> 02:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
williams
 
02:17:58.870 --> 02:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:18:00.870 --> 02:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:18:03.429 --> 02:18:03.439 align:start position:0%
uh so we'll we'll do that before we send
 
02:18:07.190 --> 02:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
it over to ols so so kevin i i forget
 
02:18:09.429 --> 02:18:09.439 align:start position:0%
your your process when you work on
 
02:18:09.439 --> 02:18:11.429 align:start position:0%
your your process when you work on
amendments

02:18:11.429 --> 02:18:11.439 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
02:18:13.830 --> 02:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
you work directly with ols don't you so
 
02:18:15.509 --> 02:18:15.519 align:start position:0%
they would end up having to come up with
 
02:18:15.519 --> 02:18:16.469 align:start position:0%
they would end up having to come up with
a

02:18:16.469 --> 02:18:16.479 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:18:19.830 --> 02:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
an ols version of an amendment
 
02:18:21.589 --> 02:18:21.599 align:start position:0%
like right away that's that's how you
 
02:18:23.509 --> 02:18:23.519 align:start position:0%
work and then we'd get that amendment
 
02:18:25.910 --> 02:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
over to mr lippman for mr williams
 
02:18:27.750 --> 02:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
review yep we could do that we should
 
02:18:29.270 --> 02:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
have one available at some point
 
02:18:30.950 --> 02:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
tomorrow for the department and
 
02:18:32.070 --> 02:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
everybody on the committee to take a
 
02:18:33.110 --> 02:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
look at
 
02:18:33.120 --> 02:18:34.790 align:start position:0%
look at
okay

02:18:34.790 --> 02:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:18:37.429 --> 02:18:37.439 align:start position:0%
all right so going back to the scene of
 
02:18:39.030 --> 02:18:39.040 align:start position:0%
the crime representative erf do you
 
02:18:40.629 --> 02:18:40.639 align:start position:0%
still have questions
 
02:18:42.870 --> 02:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman i have my real
 
02:18:42.880 --> 02:18:44.230 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman i have my real
questions

02:18:44.230 --> 02:18:44.240 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:18:47.190 --> 02:18:47.200 align:start position:0%
so i'm glad we have the
 
02:18:49.589 --> 02:18:49.599 align:start position:0%
um oh my goodness
 
02:18:49.599 --> 02:18:52.870 align:start position:0%
um oh my goodness
miss

02:18:52.870 --> 02:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:55.190 --> 02:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
what's your function again actually
 
02:18:56.469 --> 02:18:56.479 align:start position:0%
actually thank you that's really who i
 
02:18:57.990 --> 02:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to talk to
 
02:18:59.429 --> 02:18:59.439 align:start position:0%
so i'm assuming you're the one that came
 
02:19:02.150 --> 02:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
up with the cost estimates
 
02:19:04.629 --> 02:19:04.639 align:start position:0%
i am not the cost estimates that you see
 
02:19:07.589 --> 02:19:07.599 align:start position:0%
are from an outside actuarial firm i did
 
02:19:09.349 --> 02:19:09.359 align:start position:0%
review their preliminary estimates
 
02:19:11.270 --> 02:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
though so i couldn't is your microphone
 
02:19:14.549 --> 02:19:14.559 align:start position:0%
on because yes we're trying to broadcast
 
02:19:16.309 --> 02:19:16.319 align:start position:0%
is that better
 
02:19:26.070 --> 02:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:28.150 --> 02:19:28.160 align:start position:0%
so i did not come up with these
 
02:19:29.910 --> 02:19:29.920 align:start position:0%
these estimates that you see these were
 
02:19:33.190 --> 02:19:33.200 align:start position:0%
done by an outside actuarial firm
 
02:19:35.110 --> 02:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
i have reviewed their work when they
 
02:19:37.270 --> 02:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
presented to the work group
 
02:19:39.830 --> 02:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
so i i feel um
 
02:19:41.589 --> 02:19:41.599 align:start position:0%
i can answer some of the questions about
 
02:19:44.389 --> 02:19:44.399 align:start position:0%
the cost estimates but really dr finney
 
02:19:46.230 --> 02:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
and mr lipman would be might be better
 
02:19:47.589 --> 02:19:47.599 align:start position:0%
but we can all close well here's my
 
02:19:49.429 --> 02:19:49.439 align:start position:0%
question then actually it's even easier
 
02:19:52.150 --> 02:19:52.160 align:start position:0%
than that can we get a copy of that
 
02:19:53.590 --> 02:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
the work that was done by the outside
 
02:19:53.600 --> 02:19:54.790 align:start position:0%
the work that was done by the outside
group

02:19:54.790 --> 02:19:54.800 align:start position:0%
group
 
02:19:57.030 --> 02:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
yes yes that's what i really really
 
02:19:59.750 --> 02:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
would like to see that kind of possible
 
02:20:01.910 --> 02:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
normally you like the spreadsheet i
 
02:20:03.670 --> 02:20:03.680 align:start position:0%
think it's just a simple little thing
 
02:20:09.510 --> 02:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:11.910 --> 02:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
i think the the
 
02:20:14.469 --> 02:20:14.479 align:start position:0%
the confusion is that
 
02:20:16.070 --> 02:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services

02:20:19.359 --> 02:20:20.710 align:start position:0%

actuarial

02:20:20.710 --> 02:20:20.720 align:start position:0%
actuarial
 
02:20:24.070 --> 02:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
called millerman is that correct yes
 
02:20:26.630 --> 02:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
and they do they do the actuarial you
 
02:20:28.389 --> 02:20:28.399 align:start position:0%
know estimates
 
02:20:29.990 --> 02:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
right and i mean gonna understand that
 
02:20:31.750 --> 02:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming it's more complete than
 
02:20:33.429 --> 02:20:33.439 align:start position:0%
just this little spreadsheet
 
02:20:35.349 --> 02:20:35.359 align:start position:0%
that is very similar to the spreadsheet
 
02:20:37.030 --> 02:20:37.040 align:start position:0%
from two years ago
 
02:20:38.550 --> 02:20:38.560 align:start position:0%
except especially from two years ago had
 
02:20:40.469 --> 02:20:40.479 align:start position:0%
a little bit more detail so i'm seeing
 
02:20:41.670 --> 02:20:41.680 align:start position:0%
what this actually did was something
 
02:20:43.429 --> 02:20:43.439 align:start position:0%
that will give me a real idea of how you
 
02:20:45.110 --> 02:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
got to these numbers because now that
 
02:20:47.670 --> 02:20:47.680 align:start position:0%
these numbers they seem very low
 
02:20:48.870 --> 02:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
i'm not like to be able to compare them
 
02:20:53.030 --> 02:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:54.469 --> 02:20:54.479 align:start position:0%
i would just say that you'll you'll see
 
02:20:56.550 --> 02:20:56.560 align:start position:0%
a difference definitely between the
 
02:20:58.950 --> 02:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
medicaid population and a normal plant
 
02:21:01.670 --> 02:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
population especially given how limited
 
02:21:03.590 --> 02:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
some of these benefits are
 
02:21:03.600 --> 02:21:04.710 align:start position:0%
some of these benefits are
so

02:21:04.710 --> 02:21:04.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:21:07.270 --> 02:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
i'll just offer that
 
02:21:08.950 --> 02:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
northeast delta dental did do some
 
02:21:11.830 --> 02:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
pricing on our own just to compare and
 
02:21:13.910 --> 02:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
came up with very similar numbers to
 
02:21:16.870 --> 02:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
what millman had come up with
 
02:21:16.880 --> 02:21:17.910 align:start position:0%
what millman had come up with
so

02:21:17.910 --> 02:21:17.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:21:19.429 --> 02:21:19.439 align:start position:0%
though you might want to take it and
 
02:21:21.670 --> 02:21:21.680 align:start position:0%
compare it to to a
 
02:21:24.150 --> 02:21:24.160 align:start position:0%
regular group insurance
 
02:21:26.630 --> 02:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
rate you're not going to find similar
 
02:21:28.230 --> 02:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
numbers there
 
02:21:29.670 --> 02:21:29.680 align:start position:0%
okay so help me understand why it would
 
02:21:31.429 --> 02:21:31.439 align:start position:0%
be a lot lower for the medicaid
 
02:21:31.439 --> 02:21:32.870 align:start position:0%
be a lot lower for the medicaid
population

02:21:32.870 --> 02:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
population
 
02:21:32.880 --> 02:21:33.590 align:start position:0%
population
the

02:21:33.590 --> 02:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:21:35.990 --> 02:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
first the benefits are very limited in a
 
02:21:38.309 --> 02:21:38.319 align:start position:0%
normal plan you're going to have crowns
 
02:21:40.150 --> 02:21:40.160 align:start position:0%
covered for example and those aren't
 
02:21:42.469 --> 02:21:42.479 align:start position:0%
going to be covered in this
 
02:21:44.710 --> 02:21:44.720 align:start position:0%
in this uh benefit offering
 
02:21:47.110 --> 02:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
um and second there's just there's
 
02:21:48.630 --> 02:21:48.640 align:start position:0%
there's differences as well there's
 
02:21:50.550 --> 02:21:50.560 align:start position:0%
pent-up demand for all these people that
 
02:21:52.710 --> 02:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
have not yet had benefits that are going
 
02:21:55.030 --> 02:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
to go in and use the plan
 
02:21:56.230 --> 02:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
there's also
 
02:21:58.710 --> 02:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
transportation extra transportation
 
02:21:59.990 --> 02:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
costs have been built in there's
 
02:22:02.150 --> 02:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
differences in benefit maximums there's
 
02:22:02.160 --> 02:22:03.590 align:start position:0%
differences in benefit maximums there's
just

02:22:03.590 --> 02:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:22:05.429 --> 02:22:05.439 align:start position:0%
it's not quite comparing an apple and an
 
02:22:07.349 --> 02:22:07.359 align:start position:0%
orange but you know you could look at it
 
02:22:08.870 --> 02:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
that way that they're they're still
 
02:22:12.389 --> 02:22:12.399 align:start position:0%
fruit but they're they're different um
 
02:22:13.990 --> 02:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
okay so first of all transportation was
 
02:22:15.750 --> 02:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
separate so i get that
 
02:22:16.870 --> 02:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
but second of all when you say that they
 
02:22:18.710 --> 02:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
haven't had dental dental service in a
 
02:22:20.230 --> 02:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
while that tends to drive up costs not
 
02:22:21.349 --> 02:22:21.359 align:start position:0%
drive them down
 
02:22:23.670 --> 02:22:23.680 align:start position:0%
so i'd expect things to even be higher
 
02:22:25.429 --> 02:22:25.439 align:start position:0%
i would be curious about if you're if
 
02:22:27.670 --> 02:22:27.680 align:start position:0%
delta dental is a good comparison i'd be
 
02:22:29.670 --> 02:22:29.680 align:start position:0%
curious to see your plans as well then
 
02:22:31.030 --> 02:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
to compare them because i know in my
 
02:22:33.429 --> 02:22:33.439 align:start position:0%
case dental plans cover pretty much
 
02:22:34.710 --> 02:22:34.720 align:start position:0%
cleanings two a year and that's pretty
 
02:22:36.630 --> 02:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
much it on top of that you're paying
 
02:22:39.270 --> 02:22:39.280 align:start position:0%
hundreds or more dollars
 
02:22:41.030 --> 02:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
and certainly crowns aren't included in
 
02:22:43.750 --> 02:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
my plans my wife's plan actually so i
 
02:22:45.270 --> 02:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
just like to see the actual you know
 
02:22:46.469 --> 02:22:46.479 align:start position:0%
what you're actually coming up with
 
02:22:48.389 --> 02:22:48.399 align:start position:0%
because i think the numbers just looking
 
02:22:51.830 --> 02:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
at them they seem very low that's all
 
02:22:54.230 --> 02:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
i can certainly share estimates that
 
02:22:59.110 --> 02:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:00.550 --> 02:23:00.560 align:start position:0%
okay but
 
02:23:02.309 --> 02:23:02.319 align:start position:0%
fine that'd be great but then can you
 
02:23:04.710 --> 02:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
compare them to the can explain to me
 
02:23:06.630 --> 02:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
because you just use general population
 
02:23:09.030 --> 02:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
versus this population but what i heard
 
02:23:11.429 --> 02:23:11.439 align:start position:0%
you say was in the medicaid population
 
02:23:13.670 --> 02:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
it was more expensive to get them on
 
02:23:15.270 --> 02:23:15.280 align:start position:0%
track so to speak so i'd like to have
 
02:23:16.790 --> 02:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
you unders i'd like to understand right
 
02:23:18.630 --> 02:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
now but i have to understand how you
 
02:23:22.070 --> 02:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
think it's less expensive than the
 
02:23:24.710 --> 02:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
a population like us like me
 
02:23:26.230 --> 02:23:26.240 align:start position:0%
i'll i'll just i'll try to offer
 
02:23:27.670 --> 02:23:27.680 align:start position:0%
something quickly and if this doesn't
 
02:23:29.910 --> 02:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
answer it we can i can certainly try to
 
02:23:32.469 --> 02:23:32.479 align:start position:0%
provide more but in a normal employer
 
02:23:35.110 --> 02:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
paid plan or employer-based plan the
 
02:23:37.030 --> 02:23:37.040 align:start position:0%
coverage is going to be 180 50. so
 
02:23:38.870 --> 02:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
that's going to cover 100 on diagnostic
 
02:23:40.230 --> 02:23:40.240 align:start position:0%
prevent those cleanings that you talked
 
02:23:40.240 --> 02:23:41.030 align:start position:0%
prevent those cleanings that you talked
about

02:23:41.030 --> 02:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:23:43.910 --> 02:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
80 on restorative basic restorative so
 
02:23:46.870 --> 02:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
so things like fillings or um root
 
02:23:49.830 --> 02:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
canals are sometimes included in that
 
02:23:53.270 --> 02:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
category oral surgery and then 50 on
 
02:23:56.469 --> 02:23:56.479 align:start position:0%
services such as crowns or implants or
 
02:23:57.510 --> 02:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
other things
 
02:23:59.429 --> 02:23:59.439 align:start position:0%
and of course orthodontic orthodontic
 
02:24:02.309 --> 02:24:02.319 align:start position:0%
could also be covered supplementally
 
02:24:02.319 --> 02:24:03.910 align:start position:0%
could also be covered supplementally
this

02:24:03.910 --> 02:24:03.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:24:05.830 --> 02:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
keep going could be
 
02:24:09.349 --> 02:24:09.359 align:start position:0%
not always but could be um so and
 
02:24:10.870 --> 02:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
you said
 
02:24:12.630 --> 02:24:12.640 align:start position:0%
often you have to go in and it might be
 
02:24:14.630 --> 02:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
a couple hundred dollars well a typical
 
02:24:16.550 --> 02:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
crown could cost a hundred excuse me a
 
02:24:18.309 --> 02:24:18.319 align:start position:0%
thousand to twelve hundred dollars so if
 
02:24:20.550 --> 02:24:20.560 align:start position:0%
it's covered at fifty percent yes
 
02:24:22.309 --> 02:24:22.319 align:start position:0%
even as an employer sponsored plan it
 
02:24:23.830 --> 02:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
could be covered you still would be
 
02:24:25.270 --> 02:24:25.280 align:start position:0%
paying out of pocket a significant
 
02:24:25.280 --> 02:24:39.910 align:start position:0%
paying out of pocket a significant
amount

02:24:39.910 --> 02:24:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:42.950 --> 02:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
most often plans are going to cover
 
02:24:45.030 --> 02:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
major services as well a typical
 
02:24:47.429 --> 02:24:47.439 align:start position:0%
employer-based plan the most common
 
02:24:49.910 --> 02:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
employer-based group insurance plan does
 
02:24:51.990 --> 02:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
in fact cover major services and
 
02:24:55.030 --> 02:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
typically those are covered at 50
 
02:24:55.040 --> 02:24:55.510 align:start position:0%
typically those are covered at 50
so percent

02:24:55.510 --> 02:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
so percent
 
02:24:56.790 --> 02:24:56.800 align:start position:0%
you just send me the plans that probably
 
02:24:58.230 --> 02:24:58.240 align:start position:0%
the easiest thing for me to look at
 
02:25:00.070 --> 02:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
because i know you're a dental person as
 
02:25:01.670 --> 02:25:01.680 align:start position:0%
opposed to a general purpose sort of
 
02:25:03.349 --> 02:25:03.359 align:start position:0%
insurance person and
 
02:25:05.349 --> 02:25:05.359 align:start position:0%
and i think it'd be good to i don't
 
02:25:06.309 --> 02:25:06.319 align:start position:0%
think most
 
02:25:08.150 --> 02:25:08.160 align:start position:0%
maybe i'm wrong i certainly know some
 
02:25:09.510 --> 02:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
corporate plans don't cover like you're
 
02:25:09.520 --> 02:25:10.389 align:start position:0%
corporate plans don't cover like you're
describing

02:25:10.389 --> 02:25:10.399 align:start position:0%
describing
 
02:25:12.150 --> 02:25:12.160 align:start position:0%
yours covers which is great but just let
 
02:25:14.230 --> 02:25:14.240 align:start position:0%
me have the plan so i can compare them
 
02:25:16.469 --> 02:25:16.479 align:start position:0%
i think i think that the actuarial for
 
02:25:19.190 --> 02:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
the department did um estimates based
 
02:25:21.349 --> 02:25:21.359 align:start position:0%
exactly on the way the amendment was
 
02:25:23.190 --> 02:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
written and what services there would be
 
02:25:24.870 --> 02:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
so i think
 
02:25:26.870 --> 02:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
we should get you whatever information
 
02:25:26.880 --> 02:25:27.750 align:start position:0%
we should get you whatever information
um

02:25:27.750 --> 02:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:29.750 --> 02:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
they have because that's a that's a
 
02:25:31.429 --> 02:25:31.439 align:start position:0%
match to the
 
02:25:34.550 --> 02:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
um amended plan um
 
02:25:36.550 --> 02:25:36.560 align:start position:0%
so that you know that that's what their
 
02:25:38.309 --> 02:25:38.319 align:start position:0%
cost estimates will be based on that
 
02:25:41.429 --> 02:25:41.439 align:start position:0%
would be great if i could just
 
02:25:43.429 --> 02:25:43.439 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't have to go i don't know
 
02:25:45.510 --> 02:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
so i i did want to say two things i
 
02:25:47.030 --> 02:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
think one is
 
02:25:48.950 --> 02:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
the professional fee schedule that goes
 
02:25:51.349 --> 02:25:51.359 align:start position:0%
along with a commercial plan is higher
 
02:25:53.590 --> 02:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
we did make an allowance
 
02:25:55.510 --> 02:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
the actuary did and the actuary for
 
02:25:57.510 --> 02:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
millamon was someone who practices in
 
02:25:59.510 --> 02:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
the dental space it wasn't just a
 
02:26:01.429 --> 02:26:01.439 align:start position:0%
general actuary they did have general
 
02:26:03.270 --> 02:26:03.280 align:start position:0%
actuary support but they had someone
 
02:26:03.280 --> 02:26:04.469 align:start position:0%
actuary support but they had someone
that

02:26:04.469 --> 02:26:04.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:26:06.950 --> 02:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
specifically deals with dental
 
02:26:08.870 --> 02:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
so there is a provision to because
 
02:26:11.349 --> 02:26:11.359 align:start position:0%
medicaid dentist participation this plan
 
02:26:12.630 --> 02:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
is only going to work if dentists
 
02:26:14.710 --> 02:26:14.720 align:start position:0%
participate right now there's a very
 
02:26:16.469 --> 02:26:16.479 align:start position:0%
limited network of dentists that will
 
02:26:18.790 --> 02:26:18.800 align:start position:0%
participate so the the cost that you're
 
02:26:20.630 --> 02:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
seeing here also includes
 
02:26:23.110 --> 02:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
an upgrade to the fee schedule for the
 
02:26:23.120 --> 02:26:24.309 align:start position:0%
an upgrade to the fee schedule for the
dentist

02:26:24.309 --> 02:26:24.319 align:start position:0%
dentist
 
02:26:28.550 --> 02:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:31.270 --> 02:26:31.280 align:start position:0%
and then i will just add on to that that
 
02:26:33.590 --> 02:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
it's important to understand that
 
02:26:36.550 --> 02:26:36.560 align:start position:0%
medicaid programs in general across the
 
02:26:36.560 --> 02:26:37.670 align:start position:0%
medicaid programs in general across the
country

02:26:37.670 --> 02:26:37.680 align:start position:0%
country
 
02:26:39.590 --> 02:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
do not pay at the same rates as
 
02:26:42.230 --> 02:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
commercial insurance we're usually at a
 
02:26:45.349 --> 02:26:45.359 align:start position:0%
percentage of commercial and so that's
 
02:26:51.670 --> 02:26:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:53.670 --> 02:26:53.680 align:start position:0%
i understand that is the goal
 
02:26:55.510 --> 02:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
but when you say
 
02:26:57.910 --> 02:26:57.920 align:start position:0%
you have to get actual dentists correct
 
02:26:59.990 --> 02:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire that will do the
 
02:27:04.870 --> 02:27:04.880 align:start position:0%
services for lower part and in the
 
02:27:06.469 --> 02:27:06.479 align:start position:0%
medical world
 
02:27:09.670 --> 02:27:09.680 align:start position:0%
that's driven by forcing hospitals to
 
02:27:11.670 --> 02:27:11.680 align:start position:0%
accept lower rates
 
02:27:13.910 --> 02:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
basically in the dental world i don't
 
02:27:16.469 --> 02:27:16.479 align:start position:0%
know you have that same leverage do you
 
02:27:17.830 --> 02:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
so that's where i think the work group
 
02:27:19.670 --> 02:27:19.680 align:start position:0%
was important in terms of
 
02:27:21.990 --> 02:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
practicing dentists and and others in
 
02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:22.790 align:start position:0%
practicing dentists and and others in
the

02:27:22.790 --> 02:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:27:22.800 --> 02:27:24.230 align:start position:0%
the
field

02:27:24.230 --> 02:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
field
 
02:27:26.150 --> 02:27:26.160 align:start position:0%
in terms of what was
 
02:27:28.309 --> 02:27:28.319 align:start position:0%
a more normative
 
02:27:30.870 --> 02:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
level of reimbursement that would expect
 
02:27:34.710 --> 02:27:34.720 align:start position:0%
to enlist it and that's also where
 
02:27:37.110 --> 02:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
a firm like delta dental who has a
 
02:27:38.870 --> 02:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
network can
 
02:27:41.030 --> 02:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
have a better chance of
 
02:27:42.870 --> 02:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
enrolling dentists because they do
 
02:27:45.110 --> 02:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
business more broadly you know the same
 
02:27:46.710 --> 02:27:46.720 align:start position:0%
could be true of another
 
02:27:48.469 --> 02:27:48.479 align:start position:0%
vendor as well but i'm just saying that
 
02:27:49.990 --> 02:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
that's i think
 
02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:50.950 align:start position:0%
that's i think
um

02:27:50.950 --> 02:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:52.710 --> 02:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
that's where the transportation came in
 
02:27:54.710 --> 02:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
as well because the dentist and the care
 
02:27:56.790 --> 02:27:56.800 align:start position:0%
management that goes with that
 
02:27:58.230 --> 02:27:58.240 align:start position:0%
as the dentist said you know i don't
 
02:27:59.429 --> 02:27:59.439 align:start position:0%
mind doing
 
02:27:59.439 --> 02:28:00.550 align:start position:0%
mind doing
um

02:28:00.550 --> 02:28:00.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:02.870 --> 02:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
services for medicaid but what i do mind
 
02:28:04.550 --> 02:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
is when i have a chair time and no one
 
02:28:07.510 --> 02:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
shows up and so it's dealing with that
 
02:28:10.150 --> 02:28:10.160 align:start position:0%
no-show rate is part of what is built
 
02:28:12.710 --> 02:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
into the program here and i think that's
 
02:28:14.389 --> 02:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
what dentists were looking for in the
 
02:28:15.590 --> 02:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
work group
 
02:28:17.830 --> 02:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
it wasn't just about reimbursement there
 
02:28:20.710 --> 02:28:20.720 align:start position:0%
were other support mechanisms that would
 
02:28:23.429 --> 02:28:23.439 align:start position:0%
allow them to consider taking uh
 
02:28:23.439 --> 02:28:24.790 align:start position:0%
allow them to consider taking uh
medicaid

02:28:24.790 --> 02:28:24.800 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
02:28:26.550 --> 02:28:26.560 align:start position:0%
i do understand that and you and you
 
02:28:28.790 --> 02:28:28.800 align:start position:0%
very nicely kept the transportation out
 
02:28:30.309 --> 02:28:30.319 align:start position:0%
so i understand that that is a separate
 
02:28:31.990 --> 02:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
cost and i'm not questioning that at all
 
02:28:33.990 --> 02:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
i was just looking at the dental
 
02:28:35.910 --> 02:28:35.920 align:start position:0%
um cost and i guess i'll be curious to
 
02:28:39.270 --> 02:28:39.280 align:start position:0%
know that you know the list of dentists
 
02:28:40.630 --> 02:28:40.640 align:start position:0%
that agreed to these rates that's all
 
02:28:40.640 --> 02:28:41.349 align:start position:0%
that agreed to these rates that's all
right

02:28:41.349 --> 02:28:41.359 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:28:43.030 --> 02:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
i think the the other thing that i just
 
02:28:45.590 --> 02:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to mention and i'm sorry to go
 
02:28:48.469 --> 02:28:48.479 align:start position:0%
back again to the categories of service
 
02:28:48.479 --> 02:28:49.510 align:start position:0%
back again to the categories of service
but

02:28:49.510 --> 02:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:28:52.710 --> 02:28:52.720 align:start position:0%
um you will see that um it's very
 
02:28:54.550 --> 02:28:54.560 align:start position:0%
difficult to
 
02:28:57.270 --> 02:28:57.280 align:start position:0%
compare two plans unless you really look
 
02:28:59.670 --> 02:28:59.680 align:start position:0%
into the specifics of what categories of
 
02:29:01.990 --> 02:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
service are included in each one
 
02:29:04.070 --> 02:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
because that accounts for some of the
 
02:29:05.910 --> 02:29:05.920 align:start position:0%
the cost difference
 
02:29:07.830 --> 02:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we tried to
 
02:29:10.870 --> 02:29:10.880 align:start position:0%
achieve with this benefit designed the
 
02:29:12.630 --> 02:29:12.640 align:start position:0%
way that it is
 
02:29:15.030 --> 02:29:15.040 align:start position:0%
was to take care of the disease that was
 
02:29:16.950 --> 02:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
going on in
 
02:29:18.710 --> 02:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
a member's mouth
 
02:29:21.190 --> 02:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
but not necessarily
 
02:29:23.349 --> 02:29:23.359 align:start position:0%
fix that with
 
02:29:26.870 --> 02:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
fixed crown and bridge work
 
02:29:30.950 --> 02:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
that you can make a choice between
 
02:29:33.270 --> 02:29:33.280 align:start position:0%
having teeth taken out and then replaced
 
02:29:35.990 --> 02:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
with removable dentures
 
02:29:39.750 --> 02:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
and so it's it's this weighing of doing
 
02:29:41.990 --> 02:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
what you need to do to be able to place
 
02:29:44.870 --> 02:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
fillings and also to extract teeth to
 
02:29:48.150 --> 02:29:48.160 align:start position:0%
get patients back to a healthy state
 
02:29:49.590 --> 02:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
and then
 
02:29:51.429 --> 02:29:51.439 align:start position:0%
you know replace teeth in those
 
02:29:53.750 --> 02:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
populations that are included to have
 
02:29:57.110 --> 02:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
dentures and those are all the ways that
 
02:29:59.990 --> 02:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
you know as you look at each iteration
 
02:30:03.270 --> 02:30:03.280 align:start position:0%
of the cost estimate we put something in
 
02:30:05.190 --> 02:30:05.200 align:start position:0%
to see what it did to the cost we would
 
02:30:07.910 --> 02:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
take something out but it was all
 
02:30:10.389 --> 02:30:10.399 align:start position:0%
ultimately based on the conversations
 
02:30:12.710 --> 02:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
that occurred at the work group
 
02:30:15.190 --> 02:30:15.200 align:start position:0%
between not only you know dentists and
 
02:30:16.630 --> 02:30:16.640 align:start position:0%
hygienists but
 
02:30:18.630 --> 02:30:18.640 align:start position:0%
other stakeholders and what was really
 
02:30:20.230 --> 02:30:20.240 align:start position:0%
important for the folks that they
 
02:30:20.240 --> 02:30:23.830 align:start position:0%
important for the folks that they
represented

02:30:23.830 --> 02:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:26.230 --> 02:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
when i talked to my dentist about this
 
02:30:28.710 --> 02:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
bill um he's um
 
02:30:30.830 --> 02:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
he's a dentist who does take
 
02:30:33.990 --> 02:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
um medicaid and also does a lot of work
 
02:30:35.190 --> 02:30:35.200 align:start position:0%
with local
 
02:30:37.510 --> 02:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
private nonprofits
 
02:30:39.990 --> 02:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
you know he was
 
02:30:42.230 --> 02:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
he was quick to tell me all the problems
 
02:30:43.910 --> 02:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
that there would be with this
 
02:30:45.270 --> 02:30:45.280 align:start position:0%
new benefit
 
02:30:47.590 --> 02:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
including the difficulty of collecting
 
02:30:49.590 --> 02:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
co-payments in his office and having
 
02:30:51.429 --> 02:30:51.439 align:start position:0%
people understand those
 
02:30:53.670 --> 02:30:53.680 align:start position:0%
and that the medicaid rates will be too
 
02:30:53.680 --> 02:30:54.630 align:start position:0%
and that the medicaid rates will be too
low

02:30:54.630 --> 02:30:54.640 align:start position:0%
low
 
02:30:56.150 --> 02:30:56.160 align:start position:0%
at the same time he said all those
 
02:30:57.429 --> 02:30:57.439 align:start position:0%
things he was
 
02:30:59.670 --> 02:30:59.680 align:start position:0%
absolutely overjoyed that there would be
 
02:31:03.349 --> 02:31:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:03.359 --> 02:31:04.469 align:start position:0%
 
that

02:31:04.469 --> 02:31:04.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:31:06.230 --> 02:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
that this would just give care to so
 
02:31:08.710 --> 02:31:08.720 align:start position:0%
many people and would
 
02:31:12.550 --> 02:31:12.560 align:start position:0%
decrease unreimbursed care in his office
 
02:31:15.270 --> 02:31:15.280 align:start position:0%
so i would say that it doesn't fix
 
02:31:15.280 --> 02:31:16.389 align:start position:0%
so i would say that it doesn't fix
everything

02:31:16.389 --> 02:31:16.399 align:start position:0%
everything
 
02:31:16.399 --> 02:31:17.429 align:start position:0%
everything
um

02:31:17.429 --> 02:31:17.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:20.070 --> 02:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
but it's a great um
 
02:31:22.309 --> 02:31:22.319 align:start position:0%
it's not just a start it's um it's a
 
02:31:24.870 --> 02:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
great improvement
 
02:31:26.550 --> 02:31:26.560 align:start position:0%
i i don't question that your plan is a
 
02:31:29.750 --> 02:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
great improvement at all my concern is
 
02:31:31.590 --> 02:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
the cost estimates that that's the part
 
02:31:31.600 --> 02:31:32.469 align:start position:0%
the cost estimates that that's the part
i'm

02:31:32.469 --> 02:31:32.479 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
02:31:34.309 --> 02:31:34.319 align:start position:0%
this is sort of what we do here
 
02:31:36.070 --> 02:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
is are these costs and if you just give
 
02:31:37.349 --> 02:31:37.359 align:start position:0%
me the information so i can look at it
 
02:31:38.630 --> 02:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
that would be very helpful there just
 
02:31:40.230 --> 02:31:40.240 align:start position:0%
wasn't enough in the financial note to
 
02:31:42.389 --> 02:31:42.399 align:start position:0%
really get an idea where the 25
 
02:31:44.230 --> 02:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
a month you know figure came from that's
 
02:31:47.270 --> 02:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
all i'm asking i understood i think that
 
02:31:49.190 --> 02:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
i have confidence in the work that the
 
02:31:51.429 --> 02:31:51.439 align:start position:0%
actuary did and i think we have a chance
 
02:31:53.110 --> 02:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
to share it with you and go over it with
 
02:31:53.120 --> 02:31:53.910 align:start position:0%
to share it with you and go over it with
you

02:31:53.910 --> 02:31:53.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:31:55.030 --> 02:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
and get you to a point where you're
 
02:31:56.710 --> 02:31:56.720 align:start position:0%
comfortable i think we're comfortable
 
02:31:58.389 --> 02:31:58.399 align:start position:0%
that if that was the budget we had to
 
02:32:00.469 --> 02:32:00.479 align:start position:0%
work with we could work within it
 
02:32:02.790 --> 02:32:02.800 align:start position:0%
super thank you i do have one statistic
 
02:32:06.309 --> 02:32:06.319 align:start position:0%
that might help significantly i hope
 
02:32:08.150 --> 02:32:08.160 align:start position:0%
um the standard
 
02:32:09.990 --> 02:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
the average reimbursement as a
 
02:32:12.469 --> 02:32:12.479 align:start position:0%
percentage of private insurance as
 
02:32:14.230 --> 02:32:14.240 align:start position:0%
calculated by the ada
 
02:32:16.230 --> 02:32:16.240 align:start position:0%
was 56 percent in the state of new
 
02:32:18.790 --> 02:32:18.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire so on average in new hampshire
 
02:32:20.950 --> 02:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
the medicaid rate is 56 percent of what
 
02:32:23.270 --> 02:32:23.280 align:start position:0%
the private insurers are paying
 
02:32:26.389 --> 02:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
so that right there speaks to what henry
 
02:32:28.230 --> 02:32:28.240 align:start position:0%
was saying about the price discrepancy
 
02:32:29.590 --> 02:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
and the fees
 
02:32:30.870 --> 02:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
so that would bring the cost down
 
02:32:30.880 --> 02:32:32.150 align:start position:0%
so that would bring the cost down
significantly

02:32:32.150 --> 02:32:32.160 align:start position:0%
significantly
 
02:32:33.429 --> 02:32:33.439 align:start position:0%
because that's all that's being allowed
 
02:32:35.110 --> 02:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
to the dentists
 
02:32:36.230 --> 02:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
when you said the medicaid you talked
 
02:32:36.240 --> 02:32:37.110 align:start position:0%
when you said the medicaid you talked
about

02:32:37.110 --> 02:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:32:37.120 --> 02:32:38.469 align:start position:0%
about
care

02:32:38.469 --> 02:32:38.479 align:start position:0%
care
 
02:32:40.309 --> 02:32:40.319 align:start position:0%
no the dent the dental medicaid right
 
02:32:41.830 --> 02:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
there are you know there's a children's
 
02:32:43.510 --> 02:32:43.520 align:start position:0%
program in place now and you mean the
 
02:32:45.190 --> 02:32:45.200 align:start position:0%
mco that currently does it that's what
 
02:32:47.270 --> 02:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
you're referring to yes no wait no the
 
02:32:49.110 --> 02:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
mcos do not cover yes one of them
 
02:32:51.030 --> 02:32:51.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't benefit
 
02:32:53.750 --> 02:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
i think in the adult dental area if
 
02:32:55.670 --> 02:32:55.680 align:start position:0%
somebody's been hurt in a car accident
 
02:32:58.070 --> 02:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
and needs some moral care because of
 
02:33:01.190 --> 02:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
trauma that medicaid can pay for that
 
02:33:03.110 --> 02:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
isn't that part of current
 
02:33:03.120 --> 02:33:03.990 align:start position:0%
isn't that part of current
yes

02:33:03.990 --> 02:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:33:05.190 --> 02:33:05.200 align:start position:0%
hold on a second
 
02:33:06.070 --> 02:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
i'll make sure we're talking about the
 
02:33:08.950 --> 02:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
same thing so there are three mcos in
 
02:33:11.110 --> 02:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
new hampshire that do medicaid one of
 
02:33:13.429 --> 02:33:13.439 align:start position:0%
them has a full dental plan no no it's
 
02:33:15.510 --> 02:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
not a full dose one of them has a dental
 
02:33:17.670 --> 02:33:17.680 align:start position:0%
plan and that's only for adults
 
02:33:19.030 --> 02:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
yeah yes
 
02:33:20.309 --> 02:33:20.319 align:start position:0%
i just want to make sure that we
 
02:33:23.349 --> 02:33:23.359 align:start position:0%
understand the children's benefit is a
 
02:33:25.510 --> 02:33:25.520 align:start position:0%
comprehensive benefit that is you know
 
02:33:27.750 --> 02:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
required by cms
 
02:33:30.230 --> 02:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
that is a fee for service plan that the
 
02:33:32.230 --> 02:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
state manages
 
02:33:34.630 --> 02:33:34.640 align:start position:0%
it's not provided by
 
02:33:36.630 --> 02:33:36.640 align:start position:0%
the mcos
 
02:33:39.030 --> 02:33:39.040 align:start position:0%
this plan isn't for children only is it
 
02:33:41.030 --> 02:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
i think we're completing things here
 
02:33:42.950 --> 02:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a i think when you
 
02:33:45.349 --> 02:33:45.359 align:start position:0%
were referring to the 56 we're referring
 
02:33:47.510 --> 02:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
to the fees that are in the children's
 
02:33:49.270 --> 02:33:49.280 align:start position:0%
program that's one
 
02:33:51.590 --> 02:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
that's one concept and so those are the
 
02:33:53.590 --> 02:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
fees that would exist today
 
02:33:55.670 --> 02:33:55.680 align:start position:0%
if we did nothing else in the in the
 
02:33:58.230 --> 02:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
adult space exactly
 
02:34:01.190 --> 02:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
that's that's sort of point one
 
02:34:01.200 --> 02:34:02.469 align:start position:0%
that's that's sort of point one
point

02:34:02.469 --> 02:34:02.479 align:start position:0%
point
 
02:34:02.479 --> 02:34:03.270 align:start position:0%
point
two

02:34:03.270 --> 02:34:03.280 align:start position:0%
two
 
02:34:03.280 --> 02:34:04.230 align:start position:0%
two
um

02:34:04.230 --> 02:34:04.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:04.240 --> 02:34:04.950 align:start position:0%
um
the

02:34:04.950 --> 02:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:34:06.630 --> 02:34:06.640 align:start position:0%
uh merit health
 
02:34:07.990 --> 02:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
is offering
 
02:34:10.630 --> 02:34:10.640 align:start position:0%
a very limited dental benefit that's
 
02:34:12.469 --> 02:34:12.479 align:start position:0%
much narrower than even what we
 
02:34:14.870 --> 02:34:14.880 align:start position:0%
described here and i think that the per
 
02:34:16.710 --> 02:34:16.720 align:start position:0%
member per month costs
 
02:34:20.150 --> 02:34:20.160 align:start position:0%
are considerably lower um
 
02:34:21.030 --> 02:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
i think
 
02:34:22.950 --> 02:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
i i i'm going to throw out a figure that
 
02:34:24.389 --> 02:34:24.399 align:start position:0%
i'd want to verify but i think we're
 
02:34:26.710 --> 02:34:26.720 align:start position:0%
talking about five dollar kind of range
 
02:34:30.070 --> 02:34:30.080 align:start position:0%
per member per month um
 
02:34:31.670 --> 02:34:31.680 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:34:33.349 --> 02:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
the america health plan has that lower
 
02:34:35.030 --> 02:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
which makes sense it's a lower
 
02:34:37.349 --> 02:34:37.359 align:start position:0%
there it's right we're not the state's
 
02:34:38.710 --> 02:34:38.720 align:start position:0%
not paying for it they're taking that
 
02:34:40.309 --> 02:34:40.319 align:start position:0%
out of their administrative load and
 
02:34:41.590 --> 02:34:41.600 align:start position:0%
they're doing that because they're a new
 
02:34:43.670 --> 02:34:43.680 align:start position:0%
entrant to the market to try to build up
 
02:34:46.070 --> 02:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
market share and they have built up a
 
02:34:47.910 --> 02:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
pretty good market share they're
 
02:34:47.920 --> 02:34:48.710 align:start position:0%
pretty good market share they're
they're

02:34:48.710 --> 02:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
they're
 
02:34:50.150 --> 02:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
the third largest plan but they have
 
02:34:54.630 --> 02:34:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:56.230 --> 02:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
so i think that addresses all my
 
02:34:58.309 --> 02:34:58.319 align:start position:0%
questions in that in that realm
 
02:34:58.319 --> 02:34:59.590 align:start position:0%
questions in that in that realm
representative

02:34:59.590 --> 02:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:35:01.429 --> 02:35:01.439 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry i thought you were done no
 
02:35:03.110 --> 02:35:03.120 align:start position:0%
i'm just warming up here this is
 
02:35:05.190 --> 02:35:05.200 align:start position:0%
actually i think for you um mr whitman
 
02:35:07.590 --> 02:35:07.600 align:start position:0%
so we just talked about the amera health
 
02:35:10.070 --> 02:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
plan do you know what
 
02:35:12.469 --> 02:35:12.479 align:start position:0%
value-added benefits of any that are
 
02:35:15.670 --> 02:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
dental related the other two mcos offer
 
02:35:18.389 --> 02:35:18.399 align:start position:0%
they might be something like an oral kit
 
02:35:20.469 --> 02:35:20.479 align:start position:0%
like that they might provide on an
 
02:35:22.389 --> 02:35:22.399 align:start position:0%
annual basis that might be
 
02:35:24.309 --> 02:35:24.319 align:start position:0%
toothbrushes and
 
02:35:26.389 --> 02:35:26.399 align:start position:0%
dental floss and that kind of thing but
 
02:35:28.550 --> 02:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
there's no there's no
 
02:35:30.950 --> 02:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
provider that they can go to to get
 
02:35:35.990 --> 02:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:37.349 --> 02:35:37.359 align:start position:0%
and i guess the last question is just
 
02:35:39.349 --> 02:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
regarding the appropriation
 
02:35:40.950 --> 02:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
just like i said why is that it's a
 
02:35:42.950 --> 02:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
pretty and i realize it's not an annual
 
02:35:44.309 --> 02:35:44.319 align:start position:0%
it's not enough to cover the annual
 
02:35:45.510 --> 02:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
appropriation but it's a fairly
 
02:35:47.349 --> 02:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
significant sum of money for a program
 
02:35:48.710 --> 02:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
that's not even starting in terms of
 
02:35:52.070 --> 02:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
starting some cash until 2024.
 
02:35:52.080 --> 02:35:52.870 align:start position:0%
starting some cash until 2024.
so

02:35:52.870 --> 02:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:35:55.429 --> 02:35:55.439 align:start position:0%
um i think there
 
02:35:56.469 --> 02:35:56.479 align:start position:0%
there's been
 
02:35:59.110 --> 02:35:59.120 align:start position:0%
since that the original um
 
02:36:01.349 --> 02:36:01.359 align:start position:0%
going back to hb4 and the derivatives of
 
02:36:03.910 --> 02:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
different uh looks at this benefit the
 
02:36:03.920 --> 02:36:04.870 align:start position:0%
different uh looks at this benefit the
state

02:36:04.870 --> 02:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:36:07.590 --> 02:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
managed care program we've historically
 
02:36:10.469 --> 02:36:10.479 align:start position:0%
had a lag in what we paid for premiums
 
02:36:12.309 --> 02:36:12.319 align:start position:0%
and the the value of that was sort of
 
02:36:12.319 --> 02:36:13.030 align:start position:0%
and the the value of that was sort of
just

02:36:13.030 --> 02:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:36:15.750 --> 02:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
cash but i think in more recently
 
02:36:15.760 --> 02:36:17.270 align:start position:0%
cash but i think in more recently
starting

02:36:17.270 --> 02:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
starting
 
02:36:19.110 --> 02:36:19.120 align:start position:0%
in 21
 
02:36:21.590 --> 02:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
um fiscal year we've we've gone to a
 
02:36:23.110 --> 02:36:23.120 align:start position:0%
standpoint of
 
02:36:25.830 --> 02:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
being if you will current on premiums
 
02:36:27.830 --> 02:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
and and effectively what we're doing is
 
02:36:30.309 --> 02:36:30.319 align:start position:0%
buying cash flow from
 
02:36:33.030 --> 02:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
and given this the
 
02:36:35.590 --> 02:36:35.600 align:start position:0%
governor's perspective on
 
02:36:37.670 --> 02:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
making payments since we also have to
 
02:36:39.270 --> 02:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
recognize the cost whether we pay them
 
02:36:41.429 --> 02:36:41.439 align:start position:0%
or not in our our comprehensive
 
02:36:43.830 --> 02:36:43.840 align:start position:0%
financial report annually it just made
 
02:36:46.150 --> 02:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
sense from an economic standpoint to be
 
02:36:48.070 --> 02:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
current in our premiums as opposed to
 
02:36:50.309 --> 02:36:50.319 align:start position:0%
arrears and so what we propose to do is
 
02:36:52.790 --> 02:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
to have the dental program consistent
 
02:36:54.469 --> 02:36:54.479 align:start position:0%
with how we're running the rest of
 
02:36:56.469 --> 02:36:56.479 align:start position:0%
managed care which is on a more current
 
02:36:56.479 --> 02:36:57.590 align:start position:0%
managed care which is on a more current
basis

02:36:57.590 --> 02:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
basis
 
02:37:00.230 --> 02:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
and that way if we started in april of
 
02:37:03.670 --> 02:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
23 we would need that appropriation
 
02:37:05.670 --> 02:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
available to us to
 
02:37:08.230 --> 02:37:08.240 align:start position:0%
make premium payments
 
02:37:13.910 --> 02:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:15.030 --> 02:37:15.040 align:start position:0%
yeah rick
 
02:37:17.270 --> 02:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
alluding back to something that mr
 
02:37:19.990 --> 02:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
lippman pointed out
 
02:37:21.830 --> 02:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
too many medicaid patients are
 
02:37:24.870 --> 02:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
unreliable at keeping appointments
 
02:37:26.630 --> 02:37:26.640 align:start position:0%
i'm tempted to say
 
02:37:28.870 --> 02:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
we ought to have a co-pay you miss your
 
02:37:32.469 --> 02:37:32.479 align:start position:0%
appointment you pay us five dollars um
 
02:37:35.110 --> 02:37:35.120 align:start position:0%
cms does not allow us to do that that's
 
02:37:38.790 --> 02:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:41.870 --> 02:37:41.880 align:start position:0%
uh rule so we never would address the
 
02:37:44.790 --> 02:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
unreliability of medicaid patients i i
 
02:37:46.710 --> 02:37:46.720 align:start position:0%
heard from one person whose practice was
 
02:37:48.389 --> 02:37:48.399 align:start position:0%
he didn't even make appointments he just
 
02:37:50.710 --> 02:37:50.720 align:start position:0%
looked out in the waiting room people
 
02:37:52.309 --> 02:37:52.319 align:start position:0%
needed help came to him came to the
 
02:37:54.469 --> 02:37:54.479 align:start position:0%
waiting room and waited i think we do
 
02:37:57.110 --> 02:37:57.120 align:start position:0%
address it in other ways
 
02:37:59.270 --> 02:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
that's one of the reasons why
 
02:38:01.510 --> 02:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
we spent a lot of time discussing care
 
02:38:06.070 --> 02:38:06.080 align:start position:0%
coordination and having support from
 
02:38:08.950 --> 02:38:08.960 align:start position:0%
employees of the dental vendor that
 
02:38:11.030 --> 02:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
would work with
 
02:38:14.389 --> 02:38:14.399 align:start position:0%
members to give them support to find out
 
02:38:15.750 --> 02:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
why is it you're missing your
 
02:38:15.760 --> 02:38:17.349 align:start position:0%
why is it you're missing your
appointments

02:38:17.349 --> 02:38:17.359 align:start position:0%
appointments
 
02:38:19.030 --> 02:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
they're unreliable people that's why
 
02:38:24.950 --> 02:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:28.550 --> 02:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
there are extenuating circumstances
 
02:38:31.910 --> 02:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
at times and i think that
 
02:38:31.920 --> 02:38:32.870 align:start position:0%
at times and i think that
we

02:38:32.870 --> 02:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:38:34.630 --> 02:38:34.640 align:start position:0%
if we're going to invest in these
 
02:38:37.429 --> 02:38:37.439 align:start position:0%
programs we need to look at the reasons
 
02:38:37.439 --> 02:38:38.710 align:start position:0%
programs we need to look at the reasons
why

02:38:38.710 --> 02:38:38.720 align:start position:0%
why
 
02:38:41.510 --> 02:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
people behave in certain ways and try to
 
02:38:43.510 --> 02:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
support them so that they can become
 
02:38:44.790 --> 02:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
healthier so
 
02:38:44.800 --> 02:38:45.830 align:start position:0%
healthier so
to

02:38:45.830 --> 02:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:38:48.790 --> 02:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
address your question as i understand it
 
02:38:48.800 --> 02:38:50.070 align:start position:0%
address your question as i understand it
you

02:38:50.070 --> 02:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:38:52.950 --> 02:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
you would propose and maybe we can do
 
02:38:55.030 --> 02:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
this in future legislation you would
 
02:38:57.910 --> 02:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
propose some kind of a penalty for a
 
02:38:59.510 --> 02:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
missed appointment so that there's an
 
02:39:01.990 --> 02:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
incentive to not miss appointments
 
02:39:03.510 --> 02:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
what we have done
 
02:39:06.550 --> 02:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
that i think is new a new new thing
 
02:39:08.710 --> 02:39:08.720 align:start position:0%
is the department has gone
 
02:39:10.389 --> 02:39:10.399 align:start position:0%
to check to see that we could get a
 
02:39:12.950 --> 02:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
waiver so that we could start to charge
 
02:39:15.590 --> 02:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
some co-pays for the people who come in
 
02:39:18.870 --> 02:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
and actually receive their services
 
02:39:22.389 --> 02:39:22.399 align:start position:0%
and dr finney is suggesting that
 
02:39:22.399 --> 02:39:23.270 align:start position:0%
and dr finney is suggesting that
we

02:39:23.270 --> 02:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:39:27.270 --> 02:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
ought to um also try to be managing
 
02:39:30.469 --> 02:39:30.479 align:start position:0%
no-shows by providing kind of the
 
02:39:33.270 --> 02:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
wrap-around services to help make sure
 
02:39:34.630 --> 02:39:34.640 align:start position:0%
they're able to
 
02:39:37.590 --> 02:39:37.600 align:start position:0%
uh have the transportation and get
 
02:39:41.429 --> 02:39:41.439 align:start position:0%
get get there now now i i think between
 
02:39:43.270 --> 02:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
our best efforts
 
02:39:43.280 --> 02:39:44.070 align:start position:0%
our best efforts
and

02:39:44.070 --> 02:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:39:46.870 --> 02:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
the inherent unreliability of some of
 
02:39:48.389 --> 02:39:48.399 align:start position:0%
the population
 
02:39:49.910 --> 02:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
i think we're always going to have some
 
02:39:52.070 --> 02:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
no-shows i think that's just the cost of
 
02:39:54.870 --> 02:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
doing business and and maybe we can get
 
02:39:57.030 --> 02:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
some stats on that in the future and see
 
02:39:58.950 --> 02:39:58.960 align:start position:0%
if there's a smart way of addressing it
 
02:40:01.110 --> 02:40:01.120 align:start position:0%
what i heard her say was that
 
02:40:03.429 --> 02:40:03.439 align:start position:0%
cms wouldn't allow us to charge for no
 
02:40:03.439 --> 02:40:04.790 align:start position:0%
cms wouldn't allow us to charge for no
shows

02:40:04.790 --> 02:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
shows
 
02:40:06.389 --> 02:40:06.399 align:start position:0%
did you say that
 
02:40:09.270 --> 02:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
and my dentist if i don't show up would
 
02:40:10.630 --> 02:40:10.640 align:start position:0%
charge me
 
02:40:12.870 --> 02:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
okay i i didn't hear dr finney say that
 
02:40:15.349 --> 02:40:15.359 align:start position:0%
my i apologize
 
02:40:17.269 --> 02:40:17.279 align:start position:0%
i was listening i would agree with you
 
02:40:19.750 --> 02:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
that it is really a big problem
 
02:40:22.469 --> 02:40:22.479 align:start position:0%
that you know having had a
 
02:40:24.630 --> 02:40:24.640 align:start position:0%
private practice psychotherapy practice
 
02:40:27.190 --> 02:40:27.200 align:start position:0%
for years and take and i took medicaid
 
02:40:29.670 --> 02:40:29.680 align:start position:0%
um it was a real problem
 
02:40:32.070 --> 02:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
for me and more importantly for the
 
02:40:34.469 --> 02:40:34.479 align:start position:0%
treatment when people didn't show up and
 
02:40:36.790 --> 02:40:36.800 align:start position:0%
and i think there is
 
02:40:39.349 --> 02:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
a certain extent it's a stereotype but
 
02:40:41.830 --> 02:40:41.840 align:start position:0%
um people whose lives people who are
 
02:40:43.990 --> 02:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
poorer and people whose lives are more
 
02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:45.670 align:start position:0%
poorer and people whose lives are more
disorganized

02:40:45.670 --> 02:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
disorganized
 
02:40:49.429 --> 02:40:49.439 align:start position:0%
probably have a higher um no-show rate
 
02:40:51.110 --> 02:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
than other people so
 
02:40:52.469 --> 02:40:52.479 align:start position:0%
i would agree with you that it's a
 
02:40:53.910 --> 02:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
problem and i think we're trying to
 
02:40:56.150 --> 02:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
address it in a positive way by giving
 
02:40:56.160 --> 02:40:57.510 align:start position:0%
address it in a positive way by giving
um

02:40:57.510 --> 02:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:59.590 --> 02:40:59.600 align:start position:0%
by supporting people to actually get
 
02:41:02.950 --> 02:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
there and um
 
02:41:05.910 --> 02:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
and we also have a a reporting aspect to
 
02:41:08.389 --> 02:41:08.399 align:start position:0%
this bill where people will where the
 
02:41:10.150 --> 02:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
department will have to report on
 
02:41:11.750 --> 02:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
various statistics and i think that
 
02:41:13.110 --> 02:41:13.120 align:start position:0%
would be one of the things that would be
 
02:41:14.790 --> 02:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
important to report about
 
02:41:17.510 --> 02:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
um at the end of the year so we can um
 
02:41:19.190 --> 02:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
try to remedy that if
 
02:41:21.269 --> 02:41:21.279 align:start position:0%
if it's uh obstacle to the whole program
 
02:41:21.279 --> 02:41:23.590 align:start position:0%
if it's uh obstacle to the whole program
working

02:41:23.590 --> 02:41:23.600 align:start position:0%
working
 
02:41:26.469 --> 02:41:26.479 align:start position:0%
one of the the major principles in a
 
02:41:28.630 --> 02:41:28.640 align:start position:0%
value-based plan
 
02:41:29.990 --> 02:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
is that
 
02:41:32.710 --> 02:41:32.720 align:start position:0%
the vendor shows that the providers are
 
02:41:35.590 --> 02:41:35.600 align:start position:0%
making improvements year over year
 
02:41:38.309 --> 02:41:38.319 align:start position:0%
and one of those improvements is to make
 
02:41:40.070 --> 02:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
sure that patients are coming in for the
 
02:41:41.590 --> 02:41:41.600 align:start position:0%
care that they need
 
02:41:43.830 --> 02:41:43.840 align:start position:0%
but i think what we've realized is it's
 
02:41:45.830 --> 02:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
not always possible for the dental
 
02:41:45.840 --> 02:41:47.030 align:start position:0%
not always possible for the dental
provider

02:41:47.030 --> 02:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
provider
 
02:41:49.670 --> 02:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
to really have any effect on
 
02:41:49.680 --> 02:41:50.389 align:start position:0%
to really have any effect on
the

02:41:50.389 --> 02:41:50.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:41:53.349 --> 02:41:53.359 align:start position:0%
patient and so we're looking to have the
 
02:41:56.230 --> 02:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
vendor be a part of that solution that
 
02:41:58.710 --> 02:41:58.720 align:start position:0%
they're giving support and it's not just
 
02:42:00.790 --> 02:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
for the dental treatment because this is
 
02:42:03.510 --> 02:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
going to run over into medical costs in
 
02:42:06.309 --> 02:42:06.319 align:start position:0%
certain situations so it behooves the
 
02:42:06.319 --> 02:42:07.349 align:start position:0%
certain situations so it behooves the
vendor

02:42:07.349 --> 02:42:07.359 align:start position:0%
vendor
 
02:42:09.670 --> 02:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
to really work with the state and also
 
02:42:11.990 --> 02:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
the providers to improve patient health
 
02:42:14.389 --> 02:42:14.399 align:start position:0%
year after year
 
02:42:16.070 --> 02:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
your follow-up
 
02:42:18.630 --> 02:42:18.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for the discussion
 
02:42:20.230 --> 02:42:20.240 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
02:42:22.150 --> 02:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
i do i have another question and then i
 
02:42:23.830 --> 02:42:23.840 align:start position:0%
have a theory so let's just do the
 
02:42:27.030 --> 02:42:27.040 align:start position:0%
theory first i i i'm actually kind of
 
02:42:29.590 --> 02:42:29.600 align:start position:0%
optimistic that we're not going to
 
02:42:29.600 --> 02:42:31.110 align:start position:0%
optimistic that we're not going to
um

02:42:31.110 --> 02:42:31.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:42:33.590 --> 02:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
run into some big numbers initially on
 
02:42:36.309 --> 02:42:36.319 align:start position:0%
pent-up demand and and part of it's for
 
02:42:39.110 --> 02:42:39.120 align:start position:0%
a good reason because when emeritus
 
02:42:41.269 --> 02:42:41.279 align:start position:0%
started their dental program
 
02:42:41.279 --> 02:42:42.630 align:start position:0%
started their dental program
um

02:42:42.630 --> 02:42:42.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:42:44.550 --> 02:42:44.560 align:start position:0%
i think they experienced some adverse
 
02:42:46.230 --> 02:42:46.240 align:start position:0%
selection and so
 
02:42:48.870 --> 02:42:48.880 align:start position:0%
so i think they burnt up
 
02:42:51.269 --> 02:42:51.279 align:start position:0%
some of the pent-up demand by
 
02:42:53.830 --> 02:42:53.840 align:start position:0%
you know the adverse selection aspect of
 
02:42:53.840 --> 02:42:54.630 align:start position:0%
you know the adverse selection aspect of
them

02:42:54.630 --> 02:42:54.640 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:42:54.640 --> 02:42:55.510 align:start position:0%
them
opening

02:42:55.510 --> 02:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
opening
 
02:42:57.990 --> 02:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
the doors and then the other thing is i
 
02:42:59.269 --> 02:42:59.279 align:start position:0%
i keep hearing
 
02:42:59.279 --> 02:42:59.990 align:start position:0%
i keep hearing
or

02:42:59.990 --> 02:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:43:02.469 --> 02:43:02.479 align:start position:0%
and this maybe you could clarify this
 
02:43:04.950 --> 02:43:04.960 align:start position:0%
we're expecting that initially there's
 
02:43:06.469 --> 02:43:06.479 align:start position:0%
not going to be
 
02:43:10.469 --> 02:43:10.479 align:start position:0%
a fully flushed out network of providers
 
02:43:12.950 --> 02:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
and if and if we don't have a flushed
 
02:43:12.960 --> 02:43:14.070 align:start position:0%
and if and if we don't have a flushed
out

02:43:14.070 --> 02:43:14.080 align:start position:0%
out
 
02:43:17.190 --> 02:43:17.200 align:start position:0%
flushed out number of providers then we
 
02:43:20.630 --> 02:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
have a rate limiting step to how many
 
02:43:22.790 --> 02:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
pent-up demand people can show up just
 
02:43:22.800 --> 02:43:24.070 align:start position:0%
pent-up demand people can show up just
because

02:43:24.070 --> 02:43:24.080 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:43:25.990 --> 02:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
you know there's no room at the end
 
02:43:28.309 --> 02:43:28.319 align:start position:0%
so so those are just theories i i don't
 
02:43:29.750 --> 02:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
know if you want to comment on any of
 
02:43:29.760 --> 02:43:30.630 align:start position:0%
know if you want to comment on any of
that

02:43:30.630 --> 02:43:30.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:43:34.150 --> 02:43:34.160 align:start position:0%
if i could comment i think that
 
02:43:36.230 --> 02:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
it could be true but i want we made an
 
02:43:38.230 --> 02:43:38.240 align:start position:0%
allowance if it didn't happen if the pot
 
02:43:39.110 --> 02:43:39.120 align:start position:0%
if the
 
02:43:41.269 --> 02:43:41.279 align:start position:0%
optimistic if you will in terms of a
 
02:43:43.750 --> 02:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
cost standpoint right um
 
02:43:45.830 --> 02:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
we have provided a factor in here to
 
02:43:47.910 --> 02:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
assume that it would be pent up demand
 
02:43:49.750 --> 02:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
but i think it's realistic given what's
 
02:43:51.670 --> 02:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
going on in society in general in terms
 
02:43:52.870 --> 02:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
of medical appointment dental
 
02:43:55.750 --> 02:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
appointments that you know the
 
02:43:57.510 --> 02:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
depending on how long
 
02:43:59.910 --> 02:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
um you know we're dealing with the coven
 
02:44:03.030 --> 02:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
situation that is there's a backup and
 
02:44:04.870 --> 02:44:04.880 align:start position:0%
availability and it would you know
 
02:44:07.110 --> 02:44:07.120 align:start position:0%
provide some relief so i didn't mean
 
02:44:08.870 --> 02:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
anything actionable by that i just
 
02:44:10.469 --> 02:44:10.479 align:start position:0%
wanted to convince representative
 
02:44:12.309 --> 02:44:12.319 align:start position:0%
shapiro that i think about this other
 
02:44:14.469 --> 02:44:14.479 align:start position:0%
than when he calls me
 
02:44:14.479 --> 02:44:16.630 align:start position:0%
than when he calls me
so

02:44:16.630 --> 02:44:16.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:44:19.429 --> 02:44:19.439 align:start position:0%
and and maybe this is a question for mr
 
02:44:22.389 --> 02:44:22.399 align:start position:0%
ripple i'm looking at page
 
02:44:24.630 --> 02:44:24.640 align:start position:0%
whatever the first page of the fiscal
 
02:44:24.640 --> 02:44:25.910 align:start position:0%
whatever the first page of the fiscal
note

02:44:25.910 --> 02:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
note
 
02:44:32.469 --> 02:44:32.479 align:start position:0%
and i'm seeing the 1.7 million in fy 22.
 
02:44:33.830 --> 02:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
and i'm i'm just
 
02:44:35.750 --> 02:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
i'm a little confused by that should
 
02:44:37.910 --> 02:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
should that 1.7
 
02:44:40.790 --> 02:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
instead of being an fy20 do find itself
 
02:44:43.990 --> 02:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
an fy23 uh we put that there because the
 
02:44:46.790 --> 02:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
act is effective upon passage so
 
02:44:48.550 --> 02:44:48.560 align:start position:0%
it would be effective this fiscal year
 
02:44:51.830 --> 02:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
but but as i read it it's money that
 
02:44:54.309 --> 02:44:54.319 align:start position:0%
sounds like it's going to pay for
 
02:44:57.830 --> 02:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
for dental care because it says 1.39 to
 
02:44:59.750 --> 02:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
fund the benefit for traditional
 
02:45:03.269 --> 02:45:03.279 align:start position:0%
medicaid population and 337.5
 
02:45:05.670 --> 02:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
to fund the benefit for the expanded so
 
02:45:07.670 --> 02:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
so that sounds like dental
 
02:45:10.309 --> 02:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
reimbursements and and we're not
 
02:45:12.710 --> 02:45:12.720 align:start position:0%
going to treat our first patient until
 
02:45:16.870 --> 02:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
april 1 of 23. i i agree with that and
 
02:45:18.389 --> 02:45:18.399 align:start position:0%
the program obviously wouldn't be up and
 
02:45:20.389 --> 02:45:20.399 align:start position:0%
running until 23. uh we just put it
 
02:45:22.389 --> 02:45:22.399 align:start position:0%
until we just put it in 22 because since
 
02:45:24.309 --> 02:45:24.319 align:start position:0%
the act is effective upon passions the
 
02:45:25.510 --> 02:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
department would have the money
 
02:45:27.349 --> 02:45:27.359 align:start position:0%
available to it immediately even though
 
02:45:30.550 --> 02:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't be spent until the next year
 
02:45:33.190 --> 02:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
okay i i will defer to you because
 
02:45:35.429 --> 02:45:35.439 align:start position:0%
you're the lba expert
 
02:45:37.349 --> 02:45:37.359 align:start position:0%
what representative
 
02:45:38.950 --> 02:45:38.960 align:start position:0%
if you wanted to you could actually put
 
02:45:40.710 --> 02:45:40.720 align:start position:0%
that into the bill but the way it's
 
02:45:43.349 --> 02:45:43.359 align:start position:0%
written it basically takes effect upon
 
02:45:45.990 --> 02:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
the date that section that portions it
 
02:45:47.910 --> 02:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't say a different date
 
02:45:49.030 --> 02:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
it could have a different effectiveness
 
02:45:51.510 --> 02:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
if you wanted to you know i i like all
 
02:45:53.910 --> 02:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
the dates that is written i i just am
 
02:45:57.269 --> 02:45:57.279 align:start position:0%
just curious why the 1.7 ends up in an
 
02:45:57.279 --> 02:45:58.469 align:start position:0%
just curious why the 1.7 ends up in an
earlier

02:45:58.469 --> 02:45:58.479 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
02:46:00.389 --> 02:46:00.399 align:start position:0%
fiscal year than what i think the
 
02:46:04.070 --> 02:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
expenditure will actually take place
 
02:46:04.080 --> 02:46:05.830 align:start position:0%
expenditure will actually take place
so

02:46:05.830 --> 02:46:05.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:46:07.510 --> 02:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
we can't spend anything practically
 
02:46:09.030 --> 02:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
until we have procured a contract and
 
02:46:11.910 --> 02:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
that's going to be a while yes
 
02:46:13.830 --> 02:46:13.840 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be before june 30
 
02:46:15.590 --> 02:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
right and that's the definition of the
 
02:46:18.630 --> 02:46:18.640 align:start position:0%
end of fy22 yeah i mean we'll we'll i
 
02:46:20.870 --> 02:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
think we don't even issue an rfi until
 
02:46:22.950 --> 02:46:22.960 align:start position:0%
august of
 
02:46:26.309 --> 02:46:26.319 align:start position:0%
this year and then go through uh an rfp
 
02:46:28.950 --> 02:46:28.960 align:start position:0%
and then a contract procurement i think
 
02:46:28.960 --> 02:46:30.469 align:start position:0%
and then a contract procurement i think
it's

02:46:30.469 --> 02:46:30.479 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:46:32.790 --> 02:46:32.800 align:start position:0%
so so mr ripple i'll i'll defer to you
 
02:46:35.110 --> 02:46:35.120 align:start position:0%
as we're amending this if if that's
 
02:46:37.269 --> 02:46:37.279 align:start position:0%
something that should be uh changed or
 
02:46:39.590 --> 02:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
modified i'll leave it to you to
 
02:46:41.670 --> 02:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
determine that i think
 
02:46:43.750 --> 02:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
i i think it's okay as written because
 
02:46:45.269 --> 02:46:45.279 align:start position:0%
as a practical matter the department
 
02:46:47.110 --> 02:46:47.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't actually spend the money until
 
02:46:49.349 --> 02:46:49.359 align:start position:0%
23 however you could solve the problem
 
02:46:51.110 --> 02:46:51.120 align:start position:0%
by as representative earth suggested
 
02:46:52.870 --> 02:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
just having a different effective date
 
02:46:56.070 --> 02:46:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:57.910 --> 02:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
isn't the effective date fairly quick
 
02:47:00.630 --> 02:47:00.640 align:start position:0%
take as soon as it gets passed which
 
02:47:04.550 --> 02:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
allows uh the department to be unleashed
 
02:47:07.670 --> 02:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
to start issuing rfis and all that stuff
 
02:47:10.630 --> 02:47:10.640 align:start position:0%
so so i i i kind of like you know
 
02:47:13.349 --> 02:47:13.359 align:start position:0%
letting them get going but but you don't
 
02:47:15.510 --> 02:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
put the first patient into the chair
 
02:47:18.070 --> 02:47:18.080 align:start position:0%
until april 1 of 23.
 
02:47:20.070 --> 02:47:20.080 align:start position:0%
and i think i think sections one and two
 
02:47:21.670 --> 02:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
could continue to be effective upon
 
02:47:23.190 --> 02:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
passage you wouldn't necessarily have to
 
02:47:24.630 --> 02:47:24.640 align:start position:0%
change that you would only change the
 
02:47:26.469 --> 02:47:26.479 align:start position:0%
effective date for section three so that
 
02:47:28.150 --> 02:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
the appropriation wouldn't actually be
 
02:47:30.070 --> 02:47:30.080 align:start position:0%
available to the department until fiscal
 
02:47:32.550 --> 02:47:32.560 align:start position:0%
year 23.
 
02:47:34.550 --> 02:47:34.560 align:start position:0%
we'd be fine with that if that's
 
02:47:36.389 --> 02:47:36.399 align:start position:0%
technically correct right
 
02:47:38.950 --> 02:47:38.960 align:start position:0%
yeah i i just keep thinking of these as
 
02:47:41.910 --> 02:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
public documents and i'd like them to be
 
02:47:43.670 --> 02:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
accurate so that the layman could pick
 
02:47:45.990 --> 02:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
it up and kind of see what's going on so
 
02:47:47.990 --> 02:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
we have have different effective dates
 
02:47:50.070 --> 02:47:50.080 align:start position:0%
for different parts of the bill yep i
 
02:47:53.030 --> 02:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
think uh sections one and two would be
 
02:47:54.710 --> 02:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
effective upon passage that's currently
 
02:47:55.990 --> 02:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
written and section three could be
 
02:47:58.150 --> 02:47:58.160 align:start position:0%
effective july first
 
02:48:01.190 --> 02:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
uh 2022.
 
02:48:03.429 --> 02:48:03.439 align:start position:0%
that'd be great that'd be great
 
02:48:06.550 --> 02:48:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:08.550 --> 02:48:08.560 align:start position:0%
representative walner representative
 
02:48:11.030 --> 02:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
rogers representative bean what do you
 
02:48:13.269 --> 02:48:13.279 align:start position:0%
think you have questions for us you got
 
02:48:16.070 --> 02:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
you want to make us smarter somehow
 
02:48:16.080 --> 02:48:17.190 align:start position:0%
you want to make us smarter somehow
no

02:48:17.190 --> 02:48:17.200 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:48:20.790 --> 02:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
we've got a couple lobbyists in the back
 
02:48:21.990 --> 02:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
do you
 
02:48:23.750 --> 02:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
you've observed this all afternoon what
 
02:48:25.190 --> 02:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
do you think do you guys want to say
 
02:48:27.190 --> 02:48:27.200 align:start position:0%
anything you want the opportunity to
 
02:48:29.190 --> 02:48:29.200 align:start position:0%
make a statement
 
02:48:29.200 --> 02:48:31.110 align:start position:0%
make a statement
no

02:48:31.110 --> 02:48:31.120 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:48:31.120 --> 02:48:32.389 align:start position:0%
no
um

02:48:32.389 --> 02:48:32.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:48:35.030 --> 02:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
all right so what i think we're going to
 
02:48:37.510 --> 02:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
do is we're going to have
 
02:48:39.990 --> 02:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
dr finney you're you're writing up a
 
02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:41.429 align:start position:0%
dr finney you're you're writing up a
snippet

02:48:41.429 --> 02:48:41.439 align:start position:0%
snippet
 
02:48:44.469 --> 02:48:44.479 align:start position:0%
so that we know what code range is
 
02:48:46.630 --> 02:48:46.640 align:start position:0%
relevant and and you're going to send
 
02:48:48.309 --> 02:48:48.319 align:start position:0%
that to mr ripple
 
02:48:50.710 --> 02:48:50.720 align:start position:0%
mr ripple's taken everything else he's
 
02:48:52.469 --> 02:48:52.479 align:start position:0%
heard and he's going to create an
 
02:48:52.479 --> 02:48:53.990 align:start position:0%
heard and he's going to create an
amendment

02:48:53.990 --> 02:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:48:55.750 --> 02:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
that amendment
 
02:48:58.710 --> 02:48:58.720 align:start position:0%
will come to obviously us but we need to
 
02:49:01.349 --> 02:49:01.359 align:start position:0%
get it to mr lippman so that mr williams
 
02:49:04.150 --> 02:49:04.160 align:start position:0%
can do his sanity check on it
 
02:49:07.750 --> 02:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
and so uh so i'm just trying to think
 
02:49:07.760 --> 02:49:08.550 align:start position:0%
and so uh so i'm just trying to think
um

02:49:08.550 --> 02:49:08.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:49:08.560 --> 02:49:10.309 align:start position:0%
um
can

02:49:10.309 --> 02:49:10.319 align:start position:0%
can
 
02:49:12.630 --> 02:49:12.640 align:start position:0%
if we say that we'll meet again on this
 
02:49:14.950 --> 02:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
the first or excuse me the 11th of
 
02:49:16.550 --> 02:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
february which is when we're going to
 
02:49:18.870 --> 02:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
hear 1677 again
 
02:49:21.349 --> 02:49:21.359 align:start position:0%
it feels to me like we could have a very
 
02:49:23.750 --> 02:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
short meeting if that amendment meets
 
02:49:27.030 --> 02:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
everyone's purposes
 
02:49:32.070 --> 02:49:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:34.309 --> 02:49:34.319 align:start position:0%
will it also be acted upon by the whole
 
02:49:36.630 --> 02:49:36.640 align:start position:0%
finance committee on that day
 
02:49:39.110 --> 02:49:39.120 align:start position:0%
the finance committee was going
 
02:49:41.030 --> 02:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
i don't want to say all that uh the
 
02:49:43.510 --> 02:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
finance committee is planning to meet
 
02:49:45.910 --> 02:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
after the 11th of february okay so we're
 
02:49:47.830 --> 02:49:47.840 align:start position:0%
releasing it from the subcommittee
 
02:49:50.790 --> 02:49:50.800 align:start position:0%
process to the finance to have its exact
 
02:49:50.800 --> 02:49:51.910 align:start position:0%
process to the finance to have its exact
session

02:49:51.910 --> 02:49:51.920 align:start position:0%

02:49:54.389 --> 02:49:54.399 align:start position:0%
so then i had earlier gotten a notice
 
02:49:56.950 --> 02:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
for the 11th for an exec session that'll
 
02:49:58.469 --> 02:49:58.479 align:start position:0%
be postponed
 
02:50:00.469 --> 02:50:00.479 align:start position:0%
that that will be postponed and in its
 
02:50:00.479 --> 02:50:01.349 align:start position:0%
that that will be postponed and in its
place

02:50:01.349 --> 02:50:01.359 align:start position:0%
place
 
02:50:03.269 --> 02:50:03.279 align:start position:0%
this working group will meet
 
02:50:03.279 --> 02:50:04.230 align:start position:0%
this working group will meet
so

02:50:04.230 --> 02:50:04.240 align:start position:0%

02:50:07.429 --> 02:50:07.439 align:start position:0%
