england
um

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
and i i introduced this bill i bring
 
00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
this bill forward because of a concern
 
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 align:start position:0%
that i have
 
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
that with all of the
 
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
new people that are coming into our
 
00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:24.159 align:start position:0%
system to educate our children that the
 
00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 align:start position:0%
children are safe
 
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 align:start position:0%
from predators and
 
00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:30.319 align:start position:0%
other folks who should not be dealing
 
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
with them
 
00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:32.470 align:start position:0%
with them
my

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 align:start position:0%
my i filed the bill originally after
 
00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
hearing about the prenda program which
 
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.070 align:start position:0%
hearing about the prenda program which
is

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
quite possibly a wonderful program but
 
00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:42.879 align:start position:0%
is designed so that um
 
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 align:start position:0%
there are pods of people working
 
00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
together with a teacher that doesn't
 
00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
have to be certified so the person that
 
00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
is leading the group
 
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 align:start position:0%
does not need to go through
 
00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
the department of education to get um
 
00:03:59.429 --> 00:03:59.439 align:start position:0%
to get any kind of
 
00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
requirements and that concerned me
 
00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 align:start position:0%
because the idea i as i understood the
 
00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
prenda program was that these small
 
00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 align:start position:0%
groups of people uh children with one
 
00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
adult in a in a spot that was would be
 
00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
chosen by the
 
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
by the adult
 
00:04:19.749 --> 00:04:19.759 align:start position:0%
is it was a potential for some
 
00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 align:start position:0%
unpleasant experiences
 
00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:25.199 align:start position:0%
so i brought this bill forward
 
00:04:27.749 --> 00:04:27.759 align:start position:0%
it requires that anybody who is working
 
00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
with children as part of a program that
 
00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.909 align:start position:0%
with children as part of a program that
accepts

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 align:start position:0%
accepts
 
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 align:start position:0%
public funds should be required to have
 
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 align:start position:0%
a background check as all teachers and
 
00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 align:start position:0%
teachers aides and other folks in public
 
00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:41.759 align:start position:0%
schools do
 
00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
and with that i'll be glad to take any
 
00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chairman thank
 
00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question how about
 
00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
volunteers that may come in for a day or
 
00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.670 align:start position:0%
volunteers that may come in for a day or
two

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question and it is a
 
00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
concern i know when i ran my my private
 
00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:05.759 align:start position:0%
preschool in kindergarten there were
 
00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 align:start position:0%
high school kids who came down
 
00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 align:start position:0%
as part of their program outreach into
 
00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919 align:start position:0%
the community and they had to be
 
00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
background checked
 
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
so volunteers in public schools have to
 
00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
be background checked when they come in
 
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
and work with children it's it's to
 
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
protect the children especially in
 
00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
situations where there's no direct
 
00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 align:start position:0%
supervision over these folks so there's
 
00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 align:start position:0%
not another adult in the room that is an
 
00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:30.639 align:start position:0%
adult and a group of children or adult
 
00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
and one child you just want to make sure
 
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
representative um i'm just uh wondering
 
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
uh what is the intent in relation to
 
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
it's a new section
 
00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.950 align:start position:0%
it's a new section
yep

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
it's to make sure that anybody who is a
 
00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:00.319 align:start position:0%
volunt employee or a volunteer of any
 
00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:02.639 align:start position:0%
entity contracted for educational
 
00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:04.840 align:start position:0%
service by the department of
 
00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:07.919 align:start position:0%
education who provides imperfect person
 
00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:09.430 align:start position:0%
education who provides imperfect person
instruction

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
instruction
 
00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:11.199 align:start position:0%
shall comply
 
00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:13.039 align:start position:0%
with having a background check
 
00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
so if the department of education or the
 
00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.070 align:start position:0%
so if the department of education or the
um

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:18.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
if a family
 
00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.189 align:start position:0%
if a family
is

00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:21.199 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
hiring a tutor
 
00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:26.639 align:start position:0%
to tutor their child
 
00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
that tutor
 
00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
should have a background check because
 
00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:32.560 align:start position:0%
that tutor is working with
 
00:06:34.309 --> 00:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
a child without another adult
 
00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:35.830 align:start position:0%
a child without another adult
supervision

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:35.840 align:start position:0%
supervision
 
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
just as in the public schools they would
 
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
need to so the purpose is to make sure
 
00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.430 align:start position:0%
need to so the purpose is to make sure
any

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
person or school or
 
00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
provider that's receiving our tax
 
00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.029 align:start position:0%
provider that's receiving our tax
dollars

00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:48.560 align:start position:0%
should comply
 
00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:50.479 align:start position:0%
as our public school
 
00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
teachers do need to
 
00:06:56.629 --> 00:06:56.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:59.350 --> 00:06:59.360 align:start position:0%
a a tutor hired by a parent might not
 
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily be employed by the
 
00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
department of education or certified by
 
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:07.360 align:start position:0%
the department of education so i'm just
 
00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:08.800 align:start position:0%
wondering if there are any other
 
00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
people who might meet the criteria
 
00:07:18.629 --> 00:07:18.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
my understanding from what we heard the
 
00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:23.120 align:start position:0%
other day
 
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
from the folks who administer the
 
00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund
 
00:07:31.029 --> 00:07:31.039 align:start position:0%
that they do require all providers
 
00:07:32.469 --> 00:07:32.479 align:start position:0%
to go through a
 
00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:34.720 align:start position:0%
rigid background check
 
00:07:36.629 --> 00:07:36.639 align:start position:0%
if i understood what they were saying
 
00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
you know it's a concern
 
00:07:41.189 --> 00:07:41.199 align:start position:0%
of mine representative
 
00:07:43.189 --> 00:07:43.199 align:start position:0%
that anybody who was hired to work with
 
00:07:44.469 --> 00:07:44.479 align:start position:0%
a child
 
00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
and is getting paid with tax dollars
 
00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:48.800 align:start position:0%
that that person is a safe person to
 
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
have around children
 
00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure how i could make it
 
00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:59.350 --> 00:07:59.360 align:start position:0%
would this still hold if they were not
 
00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:06.629 --> 00:08:06.639 align:start position:0%
everybody that works with a child should
 
00:08:08.629 --> 00:08:08.639 align:start position:0%
have a background check to make sure
 
00:08:10.869 --> 00:08:10.879 align:start position:0%
that they are not
 
00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
of a nature that might do harm to the
 
00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:16.160 align:start position:0%
child so that was one i have a second
 
00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
yes thank you a second question
 
00:08:20.469 --> 00:08:20.479 align:start position:0%
which is
 
00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
who authorizes and does the background
 
00:08:24.869 --> 00:08:24.879 align:start position:0%
check who does the background check come
 
00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
to the results who do the results come
 
00:08:30.629 --> 00:08:30.639 align:start position:0%
to etc how does that actually work that
 
00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
would have to be established by the
 
00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:33.919 align:start position:0%
rules of the department i imagine if and
 
00:08:36.389 --> 00:08:36.399 align:start position:0%
i believe they have rules already for
 
00:08:39.029 --> 00:08:39.039 align:start position:0%
background checks for some people who
 
00:08:41.509 --> 00:08:41.519 align:start position:0%
are being
 
00:08:43.029 --> 00:08:43.039 align:start position:0%
who are working with the department of
 
00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:44.800 align:start position:0%
education didn't the learn everywhere
 
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
program they talked about how all those
 
00:08:48.949 --> 00:08:48.959 align:start position:0%
programs everybody that works with the
 
00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:50.720 align:start position:0%
kids has to go through the background
 
00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:53.440 align:start position:0%
check before they are approved for the
 
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
program so i'm hoping that
 
00:08:58.949 --> 00:08:58.959 align:start position:0%
with all of these new programs we have
 
00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
now we have prenda we have learn
 
00:09:03.829 --> 00:09:03.839 align:start position:0%
everywhere we have efas where people can
 
00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
take their children anywhere on
 
00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
to to be educated that the people who
 
00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
would working with the children are safe
 
00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
people to have working with children
 
00:09:15.829 --> 00:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
and the department would i'm sure have
 
00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:17.680 align:start position:0%
to figure that out or the scholarship
 
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
granting organization or whoever else is
 
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
recommending or paying these people to
 
00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
provide these services
 
00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:27.920 align:start position:0%

does for uh for the quote learn
 
00:09:59.509 --> 00:09:59.519 align:start position:0%
everywhere program
 
00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:02.720 align:start position:0%
could um could number one help to
 
00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:03.829 align:start position:0%
could um could number one help to
assure

00:10:03.829 --> 00:10:03.839 align:start position:0%
assure
 
00:10:03.839 --> 00:10:04.790 align:start position:0%
assure
that

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
that you've got um
 
00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
qualifi or you know people that have
 
00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
have cleared criminal background checks
 
00:10:19.269 --> 00:10:19.279 align:start position:0%
and number two really put the department
 
00:10:20.949 --> 00:10:20.959 align:start position:0%
in a position where they could be a
 
00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
clearinghouse a huge support
 
00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
for uh for parents that uh that may be
 
00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
homeschooling their children and want to
 
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
see a list of
 
00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
of tutors let's say that have um that
 
00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
have cleared department uh criminal
 
00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
background checks very much like the
 
00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
learn everywhere program an enormous um
 
00:10:43.509 --> 00:10:43.519 align:start position:0%
assistance to uh homeschooling families
 
00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
and i yes i think it would be and you
 
00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
know if i were a parent and i was hiring
 
00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
someone to work with my child i'd want
 
00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:50.240 align:start position:0%
to make sure that
 
00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.190 align:start position:0%
to make sure that
person

00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:51.200 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:53.200 align:start position:0%
wasn't someone who
 
00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.069 align:start position:0%
wasn't someone who
has

00:10:54.069 --> 00:10:54.079 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
a background of abusing children i mean
 
00:10:58.069 --> 00:10:58.079 align:start position:0%
it just makes sense that i would know
 
00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
that want to know that and simply saying
 
00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
to the person
 
00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
you don't have any background abusing
 
00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:06.160 align:start position:0%
children is do you it's not a good
 
00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:08.560 align:start position:0%
guarantee so i want to make sure that
 
00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
any child that's getting services that
 
00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
tax dollars are paying for that those
 
00:11:16.069 --> 00:11:16.079 align:start position:0%
people that are providing those services
 
00:11:16.079 --> 00:11:16.949 align:start position:0%
people that are providing those services
are

00:11:16.949 --> 00:11:16.959 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:11:18.949 --> 00:11:18.959 align:start position:0%
on the up and up we hear so many horror
 
00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
stories i've heard horror stories in my
 
00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
own town it's not a good situation when
 
00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:27.200 align:start position:0%
someone who has a bad background
 
00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:29.200 align:start position:0%
ends up with a group of children it's
 
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
just not good follow up on that yeah mr
 
00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:38.949 --> 00:11:38.959 align:start position:0%
i mean this is specific to um to um uh
 
00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:41.680 align:start position:0%
family students who are receiving public
 
00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh dollars to fund their their education
 
00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:47.200 align:start position:0%
why can't they go and just do the
 
00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
criminal background checks themselves
 
00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:52.720 align:start position:0%
it's a rhetorical question
 
00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
they could i said no no they can't
 
00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:56.240 align:start position:0%
i don't think i don't know if they are
 
00:11:58.870 --> 00:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
allowed to do that i mean they can't get
 
00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
private records i don't know
 
00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:04.240 align:start position:0%
certainly for the multi-state um right
 
00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:05.590 align:start position:0%
certainly for the multi-state um right
right

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:09.680 align:start position:0%

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
thank you um i'm just looking at lines
 
00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
uh 1516
 
00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh section three
 
00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:17.269 align:start position:0%
uh section three
um

00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
if uh someone um has a tax credit
 
00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
scholarship for instance
 
00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:26.240 align:start position:0%
um and is doing a home education program
 
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
are you saying that the parent needs to
 
00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
have a background check
 
00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:35.110 align:start position:0%
have a background check
no

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
how about um
 
00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes go ahead um uh i know a
 
00:12:44.629 --> 00:12:44.639 align:start position:0%
lady in town who is doing a
 
00:12:47.829 --> 00:12:47.839 align:start position:0%
history program for about uh 10 home
 
00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
educated high school
 
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
uh students and i think maybe someone in
 
00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
that group um has a tax credit
 
00:12:57.990 --> 00:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
scholarship um would the woman
 
00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
conducting that course be required to
 
00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
get a
 
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
background check is she being paid with
 
00:13:05.509 --> 00:13:05.519 align:start position:0%
those tax credit dollars
 
00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
um i don't know if she's being paid or
 
00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:09.680 align:start position:0%
not if she's being paid with tax credit
 
00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
dollars if she's being paid with
 
00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money then she needs to have a
 
00:13:15.829 --> 00:13:15.839 align:start position:0%
background check if she's working with a
 
00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
group of children alone in a room and
 
00:13:20.389 --> 00:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
she has and she is receiving
 
00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
public money she needs to be
 
00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
safe for those children
 
00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:26.389 align:start position:0%
safe for those children
yes

00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:26.399 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:13:26.399 --> 00:13:27.990 align:start position:0%
yes
um

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
i i think and we can talk about this
 
00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
more but
 
00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
would you
 
00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
would you agree that the courts
 
00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:37.590 align:start position:0%
would you agree that the courts
have

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
indicated that via tax credit
 
00:13:42.949 --> 00:13:42.959 align:start position:0%
scholarship program or education savings
 
00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
account anything like that where the
 
00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:48.160 align:start position:0%
dollars are going to the family that is
 
00:13:51.269 --> 00:13:51.279 align:start position:0%
no longer public money that is being
 
00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
paid to the service provider are you
 
00:13:55.829 --> 00:13:55.839 align:start position:0%
familiar with those
 
00:13:58.629 --> 00:13:58.639 align:start position:0%
court rulings yes i am and i think that
 
00:14:00.069 --> 00:14:00.079 align:start position:0%
that's the equivalent of money
 
00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
laundering in my opinion
 
00:14:06.069 --> 00:14:06.079 align:start position:0%
representative tanner
 
00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:08.470 align:start position:0%
thank you
and

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:10.240 align:start position:0%
there's still court cases pending on
 
00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:16.629 --> 00:14:16.639 align:start position:0%
okay sorry
 
00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
is that better
 
00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
00:14:21.829 --> 00:14:21.839 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
one of the things about this this bill
 
00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh is that um you're asking for
 
00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
background checks under rsa 77
 
00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
g colon 8-a
 
00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
which is something that we've been
 
00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
representative mullen had some additions
 
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
to it about like trafficking human
 
00:14:43.829 --> 00:14:43.839 align:start position:0%
trafficking and stuff
 
00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
does this up the criminal background
 
00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
checks that are currently
 
00:14:51.829 --> 00:14:51.839 align:start position:0%
being done by um
 
00:14:53.829 --> 00:14:53.839 align:start position:0%
this the scholarship organization in
 
00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
other words some of these places that
 
00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
say they're doing criminal background
 
00:15:01.189 --> 00:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
checks are they really doing this 77-g
 
00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
i don't know representative what the
 
00:15:05.829 --> 00:15:05.839 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization is requiring
 
00:15:07.509 --> 00:15:07.519 align:start position:0%
i don't know what
 
00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
section of law they are going under
 
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.829 align:start position:0%
section of law they are going under
um

00:15:11.829 --> 00:15:11.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
this specifically mentions 189 13 a
 
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:15:22.389 --> 00:15:22.399 align:start position:0%
as 77 g7 but this makes it clear that
 
00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
you want them to have the
 
00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
we we want them to have the same
 
00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
criminal background check that a public
 
00:15:32.069 --> 00:15:32.079 align:start position:0%
school teacher would have or a public
 
00:15:32.079 --> 00:15:33.350 align:start position:0%
school teacher would have or a public
school

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
paraprofessional would have or anybody
 
00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:38.240 align:start position:0%
in a public school system would have to
 
00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:46.720 align:start position:0%

00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:52.160 align:start position:0%
four and one incoming name four
 
00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:54.160 align:start position:0%
organizations the 4-h
 
00:15:55.749 --> 00:15:55.759 align:start position:0%
the teacher goes in to give a little
 
00:15:57.749 --> 00:15:57.759 align:start position:0%
history class on the
 
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
state house tin mountain conference
 
00:16:02.389 --> 00:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
conservation service and bringing a
 
00:16:04.629 --> 00:16:04.639 align:start position:0%
guest speaker into a school would they
 
00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:06.959 align:start position:0%
all need these checks if they're being
 
00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
paid with top public dollars
 
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
according to this bill they would be if
 
00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
they're volunteering most likely not
 
00:16:16.629 --> 00:16:16.639 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
person like us you had a question
 
00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
well i just had a follow-up because you
 
00:16:23.269 --> 00:16:23.279 align:start position:0%
keep emphasizing if they're alone in the
 
00:16:23.279 --> 00:16:24.230 align:start position:0%
keep emphasizing if they're alone in the
room

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
room
 
00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:26.240 align:start position:0%
and yet when i ask you said even if
 
00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:28.240 align:start position:0%
they're not for instance if a parent
 
00:16:30.389 --> 00:16:30.399 align:start position:0%
hires a music teacher
 
00:16:33.189 --> 00:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
and sits in the lessons the whole time
 
00:16:35.749 --> 00:16:35.759 align:start position:0%
that music teacher still needs i just
 
00:16:37.189 --> 00:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
want to make sure i'm understanding
 
00:16:38.949 --> 00:16:38.959 align:start position:0%
because the parents there
 
00:16:40.949 --> 00:16:40.959 align:start position:0%
the whole time the teacher is there that
 
00:16:43.189 --> 00:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
teacher would still need
 
00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
a background check according to this
 
00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:48.320 align:start position:0%
bill if the teacher was being paid with
 
00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:50.320 align:start position:0%
public funds then the teacher would need
 
00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
to have a background check okay thank
 
00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
any further yes representative hobson
 
00:16:58.949 --> 00:16:58.959 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question um i just was looking
 
00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:03.440 align:start position:0%
at the fiscal note on the back it
 
00:17:05.029 --> 00:17:05.039 align:start position:0%
indicates that the cost is
 
00:17:07.189 --> 00:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
indeterminable i was wondering if you
 
00:17:09.909 --> 00:17:09.919 align:start position:0%
could speak to that
 
00:17:11.909 --> 00:17:11.919 align:start position:0%
no they can't the
 
00:17:14.309 --> 00:17:14.319 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes the department of
 
00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
education can you tell me who would be
 
00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:19.360 align:start position:0%
paying for these background checks would
 
00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
it be the person applying or the doe
 
00:17:24.949 --> 00:17:24.959 align:start position:0%
i would imagine that in order to get set
 
00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
up to be a person who is
 
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
providing educational services under any
 
00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
of these programs that they would take
 
00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
it on themselves to pay for it
 
00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
the people who are providing these
 
00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:38.549 align:start position:0%
the people who are providing these
services

00:17:38.549 --> 00:17:38.559 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
are not employees of the state but they
 
00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
are receiving public money so therefore
 
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
it needs to meet i feel they need to be
 
00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:48.630 align:start position:0%
it needs to meet i feel they need to be
sure

00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:48.640 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
that they are safe to deal with children
 
00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
i mean this is not a complicated issue
 
00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
here this is a child safety issue we
 
00:17:58.950 --> 00:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
don't want to find out five years from
 
00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
now that there was some kind of an
 
00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
organization that was using these kinds
 
00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
of programs to get in and work with our
 
00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:08.720 align:start position:0%
children i just think it's a protection
 
00:18:11.029 --> 00:18:11.039 align:start position:0%
for them it's not a harmful thing it
 
00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be in anybody's way to say you
 
00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
can't provide the services it shouldn't
 
00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
parents should be eager to do this
 
00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
because they want to make sure that
 
00:18:20.789 --> 00:18:20.799 align:start position:0%
their kids are safe and i just want to
 
00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
make sure we have it in the law that yes
 
00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
these things are required so parents can
 
00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
be confident
 
00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there further
 
00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
questions representative cornell thank
 
00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
you thank you for taking my question if
 
00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
i remember right a million years ago
 
00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
when i became an educator i paid for my
 
00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
own criminal background check
 
00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
before they would hire me and i i think
 
00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:46.240 align:start position:0%
that's still the way it is now well i
 
00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
know when i had my certificate trans
 
00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
extended to the state of new jersey in
 
00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:58.230 --> 00:18:58.240 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock
 
00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative um from the
 
00:19:02.549 --> 00:19:02.559 align:start position:0%
live just a clarification if i may um
 
00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:04.720 align:start position:0%
where i see that uh attorney fenton is
 
00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:05.669 align:start position:0%
where i see that uh attorney fenton is
here

00:19:05.669 --> 00:19:05.679 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
maybe give us some clarity on the
 
00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:10.160 align:start position:0%
question of the scholarship has been
 
00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
reported that the scholarship
 
00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
organization provides criminal
 
00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
background checks and it hasn't been
 
00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
discerned if the background checks are
 
00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:20.240 align:start position:0%
equal to or similar to or as similar as
 
00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
our current background checks we do for
 
00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
all the other sampling so perhaps you
 
00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
could give us that information yeah i
 
00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
plan on asking the department if they
 
00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
have any technical advice for us on this
 
00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
or we will get questions they have not
 
00:19:33.909 --> 00:19:33.919 align:start position:0%
submitted a pink card
 
00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
so at this point in time i'm going to
 
00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
we've had her as a representative
 
00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
senator and we've had her governor too
 
00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
so you know
 
00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
so i i mix and match and i'm sure she
 
00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:52.720 align:start position:0%
appreciates perhaps that young woman in
 
00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:54.400 align:start position:0%
the back pink cod could answer the
 
00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
question later
 
00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you
 
00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:00.950 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you
suggestion

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:03.909 --> 00:20:03.919 align:start position:0%
that would be wonderful that's wonderful
 
00:20:05.669 --> 00:20:05.679 align:start position:0%
okay so we're going to continue with
 
00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
questions here for representative porter
 
00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
if we have questions for representative
 
00:20:10.789 --> 00:20:10.799 align:start position:0%
porter this time and then we'll get her
 
00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
off the hot seat and get some others up
 
00:20:13.909 --> 00:20:13.919 align:start position:0%
in front we do have one other card
 
00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
that's come forward
 
00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:18.320 align:start position:0%
representative can i just put forward a
 
00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:23.669 --> 00:20:23.679 align:start position:0%
concerning whether the money that's
 
00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
going to education freedom accounts is
 
00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
actually taxpayer money or not
 
00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.669 align:start position:0%
actually taxpayer money or not
when

00:20:31.669 --> 00:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:36.149 --> 00:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
citizens receive food stamp help
 
00:20:38.789 --> 00:20:38.799 align:start position:0%
when citizens receive medicaid
 
00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
when citizens receive other services
 
00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
that are provided
 
00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
by the government
 
00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:46.640 align:start position:0%
is that not
 
00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars going to those programs
 
00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
even though they're going through
 
00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
medicaid they're going through the food
 
00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
stamp program they're still taxpayer
 
00:20:59.909 --> 00:20:59.919 align:start position:0%
dollars and so that is why i believe
 
00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
that this is important that it's my
 
00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
money going to pay this person i want to
 
00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:07.360 align:start position:0%
make sure my money is being used by
 
00:21:09.029 --> 00:21:09.039 align:start position:0%
someone who is
 
00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
worthy of working with children well
 
00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:13.360 align:start position:0%
note that down as part of your testimony
 
00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to respond to it
 
00:21:16.549 --> 00:21:16.559 align:start position:0%
we're not going to take questions from
 
00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:18.640 align:start position:0%
the people that are presenting
 
00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:22.640 align:start position:0%
um so then uh we will ask that are there
 
00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
any more questions for representative
 
00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:26.470 align:start position:0%
any more questions for representative
porter

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
porter
 
00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:30.799 align:start position:0%
yes representative ford
 
00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:21:34.789 --> 00:21:34.799 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
my question has to do with service such
 
00:21:39.669 --> 00:21:39.679 align:start position:0%
as i performed i had a former school
 
00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:43.280 align:start position:0%
board member i volunteered as a to be
 
00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
like a para assistant in the schools
 
00:21:48.549 --> 00:21:48.559 align:start position:0%
just to see how things were working i
 
00:21:49.669 --> 00:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
didn't know
 
00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:52.240 align:start position:0%
and uh so i did i did that i had to have
 
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
a background check for it
 
00:21:57.430 --> 00:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
that experience makes me wonder if
 
00:21:59.590 --> 00:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
for that large number of people who
 
00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
might and i say large because there are
 
00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of them who do come in come into
 
00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
schools to give presentations and talk
 
00:22:08.549 --> 00:22:08.559 align:start position:0%
about what they do and whatever
 
00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
i wonder if the key factor is and
 
00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
they're not paid they just come in and
 
00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:12.950 align:start position:0%
they're not paid they just come in and
volunteer

00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
volunteer
 
00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
so they might slip to this radar and yet
 
00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
still be a threat to a child and so in
 
00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
that i'm thinking
 
00:22:22.149 --> 00:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
maybe that there ought to be some
 
00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
provision uh for unescorted people or
 
00:22:28.549 --> 00:22:28.559 align:start position:0%
some other definition added in addition
 
00:22:31.029 --> 00:22:31.039 align:start position:0%
i know your concern is the dollars but
 
00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm thinking of the intent of the
 
00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
bill and just thinking in the same way
 
00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
might it be a good idea to also put that
 
00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:40.720 align:start position:0%
such people must be continually escorted
 
00:22:43.669 --> 00:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
never left alone with with children
 
00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
it's a possibility thank you for
 
00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:47.200 align:start position:0%
bringing it up
 
00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
further further questions
 
00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you very much
 
00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
and at this point in time um
 
00:22:58.789 --> 00:22:58.799 align:start position:0%
we have represented are not represented
 
00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
miss tunnel would uh here to present too
 
00:23:04.789 --> 00:23:04.799 align:start position:0%
so before we get to our our kernel here
 
00:23:06.549 --> 00:23:06.559 align:start position:0%
in the back of the room
 
00:23:08.549 --> 00:23:08.559 align:start position:0%
uh then i'd like to have miss tuttle
 
00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
come forward
 
00:23:22.549 --> 00:23:22.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:24.789 --> 00:23:24.799 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you chairman members of
 
00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
the committee i'm not sure what to say
 
00:23:28.549 --> 00:23:28.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
for the record i'm megan tuttle
 
00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
president for any in new hampshire
 
00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
representing 17 000 public school
 
00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
educators across the state i do have
 
00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
written testimony i'll pass in so i'm
 
00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
not going to read the whole thing just
 
00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
very simply we're here in support of
 
00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
this bill you know the intent of it is
 
00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
to have anybody that's working with
 
00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:43.990 align:start position:0%
to have anybody that's working with
children

00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
receiving public tax dollars to make
 
00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
sure they have the same background
 
00:23:49.029 --> 00:23:49.039 align:start position:0%
checks that educators in the schools do
 
00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
i know that as a volunteer
 
00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:52.870 align:start position:0%
i know that as a volunteer
on

00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
pto for my
 
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
my third and fifth grader um just going
 
00:23:58.950 --> 00:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
into the school to do anything for pto i
 
00:24:00.149 --> 00:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
have to get background checked and
 
00:24:01.909 --> 00:24:01.919 align:start position:0%
fingerprinted which i did
 
00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
i'm somehow still on the middle school
 
00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
pto even though i don't have children in
 
00:24:06.549 --> 00:24:06.559 align:start position:0%
the middle school right now i'm not sure
 
00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
how that worked um but i had to get
 
00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
thing you know it's the same
 
00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
fingerprinting process for all that so
 
00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
you know we're here in support of that
 
00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:14.320 align:start position:0%
if we look just this year and last year
 
00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:16.480 align:start position:0%
legislature and the doe
 
00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
have undergone several initiatives and
 
00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
law changes to make sure that the
 
00:24:21.029 --> 00:24:21.039 align:start position:0%
background checks were thorough and
 
00:24:22.549 --> 00:24:22.559 align:start position:0%
we've added or you've added i shouldn't
 
00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:24.640 align:start position:0%
say we we've been in support of adding
 
00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
different um violations etc to this
 
00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:30.640 align:start position:0%
um we have our educator code of conduct
 
00:24:32.789 --> 00:24:32.799 align:start position:0%
which i always have my copy with me um
 
00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
and so you know that's been passed
 
00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
through and so i think just the intent
 
00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
of this with everything that's been done
 
00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:39.440 align:start position:0%
in the past few years it's it's it
 
00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
should just happen i don't really know
 
00:24:44.149 --> 00:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
um why we would hold
 
00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:46.480 align:start position:0%
a private edu a private provider
 
00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
to a different standard than we hold the
 
00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
educators and the public schools to this
 
00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:50.310 align:start position:0%
educators and the public schools to this
so

00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:50.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
um i think this is a really good
 
00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to correct this and just
 
00:24:56.549 --> 00:24:56.559 align:start position:0%
urge everyone to pass
 
00:24:57.909 --> 00:24:57.919 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
00:25:02.549 --> 00:25:02.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
are you off the hook thank you very much
 
00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
at this time we'd like to have the
 
00:25:10.789 --> 00:25:10.799 align:start position:0%
individual from the department of
 
00:25:10.799 --> 00:25:11.909 align:start position:0%
individual from the department of
education

00:25:11.909 --> 00:25:11.919 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
well you know you can be a full colonel
 
00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
or a lieutenant colonel light colonel i
 
00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
guess i'll just have to stick with a
 
00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
lawyer that's great thank you as i
 
00:25:26.789 --> 00:25:26.799 align:start position:0%
always tell people as a former
 
00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:28.400 align:start position:0%
prosecutor believe me i've been called
 
00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:30.400 align:start position:0%
worse so i will take
 
00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:32.240 align:start position:0%
the names you've been giving me so i
 
00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:34.400 align:start position:0%
want to provide a little bit of clarity
 
00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
um when it comes to volunteers because
 
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
volunteers are always a conundrum
 
00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:39.669 align:start position:0%
volunteers are always a conundrum
um

00:25:39.669 --> 00:25:39.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
the law 189 13 a sets out that
 
00:25:46.149 --> 00:25:46.159 align:start position:0%
volunteers are determined by policy
 
00:25:48.149 --> 00:25:48.159 align:start position:0%
school district policy it is a local
 
00:25:49.909 --> 00:25:49.919 align:start position:0%
issue and there are two groups of
 
00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
volunteers there's volunteers and then
 
00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
there's designated volunteers
 
00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:57.440 align:start position:0%
each school district will have a
 
00:25:59.909 --> 00:25:59.919 align:start position:0%
different policy that talks about what
 
00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:02.240 align:start position:0%
is or who is um
 
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
a designated volunteer and the way that
 
00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
i always explain it is if i were to go
 
00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
to my son's school for the valentine's
 
00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
day party most likely i would just be
 
00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
viewed as a volunteer and therefore not
 
00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
subject to the background check
 
00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
but if i were to volunteer on a weekly
 
00:26:20.549 --> 00:26:20.559 align:start position:0%
basis participate in you know teaching
 
00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
the chess club or the ski club or
 
00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
whatever school affiliated activity then
 
00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
i would be a designated volunteer and i
 
00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
would be subject to the background check
 
00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:34.400 align:start position:0%
with all the work that this committee
 
00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
and the house in general has been doing
 
00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
on 189 13a
 
00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
i will share with you that the majority
 
00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
of school districts have had the
 
00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity and the reason to go back
 
00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
and revise those policies so i commend
 
00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
you for that because i know that those
 
00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
policies just hadn't been looked at
 
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
wasn't out of malice it was just out of
 
00:26:55.669 --> 00:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
everyday life um but due to the work
 
00:26:57.510 --> 00:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
this committee has been doing on this
 
00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
important area a lot of those
 
00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
school districts have had the
 
00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity to revise that but generally
 
00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
speaking that's the lay of the land when
 
00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
i can also tell you in very general
 
00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:15.669 align:start position:0%
i can also tell you in very general
terms

00:27:15.669 --> 00:27:15.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:15.679 --> 00:27:16.710 align:start position:0%
 
i

00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:16.720 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
would think of myself as someone who's
 
00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
pretty adamant about child safety given
 
00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
my background and i think this committee
 
00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:24.320 align:start position:0%
would agree but i i really pale in
 
00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
comparison to the commissioner um i've i
 
00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
honestly have never met anyone who is so
 
00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:30.149 align:start position:0%
honestly have never met anyone who is so
child

00:27:30.149 --> 00:27:30.159 align:start position:0%
child
 
00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:32.240 align:start position:0%
safety focused and so all of these
 
00:27:35.029 --> 00:27:35.039 align:start position:0%
programs that the department is doing
 
00:27:37.669 --> 00:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
i know that the commissioner and i have
 
00:27:40.789 --> 00:27:40.799 align:start position:0%
spent many hours talking about how we
 
00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:43.360 align:start position:0%
incorporate the background check into it
 
00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
so with the learn everywhere program i
 
00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:47.200 align:start position:0%
know in the rules and they are currently
 
00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
revised and going through the jail car
 
00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:50.710 align:start position:0%
revised and going through the jail car
process

00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:50.720 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:52.480 align:start position:0%
there is a provision in there that i'm
 
00:27:54.149 --> 00:27:54.159 align:start position:0%
happy to share with the committee that
 
00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
talks about
 
00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
that each entity has to have a policy
 
00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
that follows 189
 
00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
they are subject to those parameters
 
00:28:06.789 --> 00:28:06.799 align:start position:0%
i will remind this committee that 189 13
 
00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
a sets out those
 
00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
as we call them those section 5
 
00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
violations right that's kind of the
 
00:28:14.789 --> 00:28:14.799 align:start position:0%
floor if you think of it i always
 
00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:16.480 align:start position:0%
compare to the federal constitution
 
00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
that's the floor of protection
 
00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
each district can adopt a policy that
 
00:28:24.389 --> 00:28:24.399 align:start position:0%
allows them to be more protective look
 
00:28:26.549 --> 00:28:26.559 align:start position:0%
at other offenses that fall outside of
 
00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
that section by violation
 
00:28:30.549 --> 00:28:30.559 align:start position:0%
and so that's where you will see from
 
00:28:32.149 --> 00:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
district to district from program to
 
00:28:32.159 --> 00:28:33.510 align:start position:0%
district to district from program to
program

00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
discrepancies and differences that's
 
00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
that local control piece that's at play
 
00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:41.360 align:start position:0%
um you know in terms of this particular
 
00:28:43.029 --> 00:28:43.039 align:start position:0%
bill again the department's not here to
 
00:28:44.789 --> 00:28:44.799 align:start position:0%
support or oppose
 
00:28:46.789 --> 00:28:46.799 align:start position:0%
i would suggest that we be consistent
 
00:28:48.789 --> 00:28:48.799 align:start position:0%
with our statutory numbers where we look
 
00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
at on page 1 line 17
 
00:28:55.510 --> 00:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
did checks under rsa 77 g8a
 
00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
if the intent
 
00:29:00.310 --> 00:29:00.320 align:start position:0%
is to be in compliance with 189 13 a
 
00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:02.480 align:start position:0%
i think that has to
 
00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
be throughout um
 
00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
there was a question about
 
00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:29:11.269 --> 00:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note i completed the fiscal
 
00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
note on behalf of the department um the
 
00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
cost was indeterminable because looking
 
00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
at the language especially at the top of
 
00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
the bill lines three through six
 
00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:23.029 align:start position:0%
the bill lines three through six
um

00:29:23.029 --> 00:29:23.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
looking at it as an attorney i felt that
 
00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
it was overly broad
 
00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:28.640 align:start position:0%
um and so
 
00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
it is impossible to calculate what this
 
00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:32.630 align:start position:0%
it is impossible to calculate what this
encompasses

00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
encompasses
 
00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
when you look at any employee or
 
00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
volunteer of an entity contracted for
 
00:29:38.549 --> 00:29:38.559 align:start position:0%
educational services
 
00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
that is very fluid that concept is very
 
00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:44.480 align:start position:0%
broad and so it's hard to quantify that
 
00:29:45.669 --> 00:29:45.679 align:start position:0%
and so that's why we have the
 
00:29:45.679 --> 00:29:47.029 align:start position:0%
and so that's why we have the
indeterminable

00:29:47.029 --> 00:29:47.039 align:start position:0%
indeterminable
 
00:29:47.039 --> 00:29:49.990 align:start position:0%
indeterminable
number

00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:51.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
thank you are there questions for
 
00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
attorney fenton president
 
00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chairman thank
 
00:29:58.870 --> 00:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
you very much attorney fenton for uh for
 
00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
joining us this morning um
 
00:30:04.549 --> 00:30:04.559 align:start position:0%
you had mentioned um just now that um
 
00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:07.360 align:start position:0%
that the the new rules i guess pending
 
00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
before jlcarr
 
00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:10.559 align:start position:0%
with respect to the learn everywhere
 
00:30:10.559 --> 00:30:11.830 align:start position:0%
with respect to the learn everywhere
program

00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
require the
 
00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:16.640 align:start position:0%
learn everywhere
 
00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:18.630 align:start position:0%
learn everywhere
providers

00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:18.640 align:start position:0%
providers
 
00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
to follow the procedures outlined in 189
 
00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
colon 13a
 
00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:26.389 align:start position:0%
colon 13a
and

00:30:26.389 --> 00:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:30:28.389 --> 00:30:28.399 align:start position:0%
and the one of the procedures that
 
00:30:30.389 --> 00:30:30.399 align:start position:0%
really jumps out at me
 
00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
is um is found in
 
00:30:36.389 --> 00:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
13 a
 
00:30:38.789 --> 00:30:38.799 align:start position:0%
roman 2
 
00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
where where an applicant
 
00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:44.480 align:start position:0%
for employment
 
00:30:46.549 --> 00:30:46.559 align:start position:0%
with the school
 
00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
in fact it says with a school
 
00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:49.360 align:start position:0%
administrative unit school district
 
00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
charter public school or public academy
 
00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't specifically call out
 
00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
learn everywhere programs or education
 
00:30:57.909 --> 00:30:57.919 align:start position:0%
service providers or whatever terms the
 
00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
department wants to use for
 
00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:02.320 align:start position:0%
tutors service providers things like
 
00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
that but it's certainly pretty broad you
 
00:31:07.909 --> 00:31:07.919 align:start position:0%
know historically captures
 
00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
you know up until learn everywhere and
 
00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
and voucher program sort of captures the
 
00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:17.200 align:start position:0%
uh the network of education providers in
 
00:31:19.669 --> 00:31:19.679 align:start position:0%
the state but anyway that a prospective
 
00:31:19.679 --> 00:31:21.269 align:start position:0%
the state but anyway that a prospective
employee

00:31:21.269 --> 00:31:21.279 align:start position:0%
employee
 
00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:22.640 align:start position:0%
submit a
 
00:31:25.509 --> 00:31:25.519 align:start position:0%
an authorization um
 
00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
or submit a release that authorizes the
 
00:31:30.549 --> 00:31:30.559 align:start position:0%
state police to conduct a criminal
 
00:31:32.389 --> 00:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
history records check
 
00:31:33.909 --> 00:31:33.919 align:start position:0%
through its state records and through
 
00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:36.320 align:start position:0%
the federal bureau of investigation and
 
00:31:38.549 --> 00:31:38.559 align:start position:0%
to release
 
00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:40.960 align:start position:0%
the report those reports to the
 
00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
superintendent or designee of the school
 
00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
administrative union or the chief
 
00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
executive officer of the charter public
 
00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
school of public academy i was wondering
 
00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:50.480 align:start position:0%
if you could say how that works
 
00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:51.350 align:start position:0%
if you could say how that works
for

00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
service providers in the learn
 
00:31:55.509 --> 00:31:55.519 align:start position:0%
everywhere program and uh and in the
 
00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
voucher program as to the mechanics of
 
00:31:59.190 --> 00:31:59.200 align:start position:0%
it yeah um
 
00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
so i will have to get back to you and
 
00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:03.200 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to do that that's more of a
 
00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
department of safety
 
00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
issue the department does not department
 
00:32:08.789 --> 00:32:08.799 align:start position:0%
of education does not house and maintain
 
00:32:11.269 --> 00:32:11.279 align:start position:0%
those records and so who the records are
 
00:32:13.669 --> 00:32:13.679 align:start position:0%
being released to to review and make
 
00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:16.240 align:start position:0%
that determination excellent question i
 
00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:17.669 align:start position:0%
that determination excellent question i
will

00:32:17.669 --> 00:32:17.679 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:32:19.029 --> 00:32:19.039 align:start position:0%
link back with our partners at the
 
00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:20.240 align:start position:0%
department of safety and get you that
 
00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
answer okay and a quick quick follow-up
 
00:32:24.149 --> 00:32:24.159 align:start position:0%
on this and this may be uh uh
 
00:32:27.509 --> 00:32:27.519 align:start position:0%
get back to us on on it as well but um
 
00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
if uh if i'm a parent of a um of a of a
 
00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:34.240 align:start position:0%
student who of an efa student
 
00:32:37.509 --> 00:32:37.519 align:start position:0%
and um uh and i'm interested in in
 
00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
hiring a tutor
 
00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:43.360 align:start position:0%
can i request the state police to
 
00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:46.480 align:start position:0%
conduct a criminal history records check
 
00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:32:50.789 --> 00:32:50.799 align:start position:0%
as well as the fbi uh multi i think
 
00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
that's a multiple state
 
00:32:55.669 --> 00:32:55.679 align:start position:0%
records check and have that information
 
00:32:58.789 --> 00:32:58.799 align:start position:0%
released back directly back to me as the
 
00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:04.310 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:33:06.549 --> 00:33:06.559 align:start position:0%
again i'm going to do the let me talk to
 
00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
the department of safety and get back to
 
00:33:09.909 --> 00:33:09.919 align:start position:0%
you the department of safety is
 
00:33:13.509 --> 00:33:13.519 align:start position:0%
regulated by very strict fbi regs um i
 
00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:15.440 align:start position:0%
have a cursory understanding of them but
 
00:33:17.669 --> 00:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
i don't want to misspeak so let me talk
 
00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
to them and i can get back to you on
 
00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:19.909 align:start position:0%
to them and i can get back to you on
that

00:33:19.909 --> 00:33:19.919 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
and one final follow-up along this
 
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
technical line of of questioning
 
00:33:28.389 --> 00:33:28.399 align:start position:0%
however the department
 
00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
does um complete
 
00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
criminal history records checks for
 
00:33:35.509 --> 00:33:35.519 align:start position:0%
let's say school bus drivers
 
00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
and uh and that information is
 
00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
is released to the department
 
00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
is that correct yes so the department
 
00:33:46.389 --> 00:33:46.399 align:start position:0%
has the ability to do this
 
00:33:50.149 --> 00:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
yes so when you look at 189 13 b which
 
00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
pertains to the bus drivers and we've
 
00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
talked about that previously in 189 13c
 
00:33:56.789 --> 00:33:56.799 align:start position:0%
which pertains to first-time teacher
 
00:33:59.269 --> 00:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
applicants those are newer initiatives
 
00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:02.240 align:start position:0%
that the department is undertaking um
 
00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:04.840 align:start position:0%
so yes the department is a governmental
 
00:34:07.269 --> 00:34:07.279 align:start position:0%
entity and we can work with our partners
 
00:34:08.869 --> 00:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
as a department of safety and receive
 
00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
those background checks and process that
 
00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
um so as we have discussed previously in
 
00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
my prior testimony that is a role that
 
00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
the department is taking on
 
00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
that infrastructure is fairly new we are
 
00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
currently building it um but yes that is
 
00:34:25.669 --> 00:34:25.679 align:start position:0%
something that we are we're facilitating
 
00:34:28.069 --> 00:34:28.079 align:start position:0%
great great so the so the outstanding
 
00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
question then is
 
00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
how do learn everywhere providers do it
 
00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
and how would a parent of an evas efa
 
00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:35.669 align:start position:0%
and how would a parent of an evas efa
student

00:34:35.669 --> 00:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
student
 
00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
do it yes and i can get you those
 
00:34:39.430 --> 00:34:39.440 align:start position:0%
answers i just want to double check with
 
00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:40.480 align:start position:0%
the department of safety because they
 
00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
get really crabby when i speak on their
 
00:34:44.149 --> 00:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
behalf and i don't work for them and and
 
00:34:47.109 --> 00:34:47.119 align:start position:0%
they're pretty well armed
 
00:34:49.589 --> 00:34:49.599 align:start position:0%
thank you very much diana thank you
 
00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:53.200 align:start position:0%
further questions representative tanner
 
00:34:54.629 --> 00:34:54.639 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:34:57.109 --> 00:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
i have actually two questions one is
 
00:34:59.910 --> 00:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
that i know words really matter uh you
 
00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
know as coming from a teacher into this
 
00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
legal atmosphere
 
00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
even the may shell you know business so
 
00:35:10.069 --> 00:35:10.079 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering what the word follows
 
00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
uh is
 
00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:14.240 align:start position:0%
used in in legalese
 
00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
when you said that they follow does that
 
00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
mean they have to they shall they are
 
00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:19.910 align:start position:0%
mean they have to they shall they are
required

00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
required
 
00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
uh they may what does that mean
 
00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i'm just
 
00:35:25.589 --> 00:35:25.599 align:start position:0%
going to pull up the learn everywhere
 
00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
because i think when um
 
00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
so the the language that i used was
 
00:35:43.589 --> 00:35:43.599 align:start position:0%
simply that it was my language if you
 
00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
look at the language in the
 
00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:48.640 align:start position:0%
learn everywhere program rules it is a
 
00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
mandate that
 
00:35:53.829 --> 00:35:53.839 align:start position:0%
the program providers have to follow
 
00:35:56.710 --> 00:35:56.720 align:start position:0%
the law as laid out in 189 13a so what's
 
00:35:58.470 --> 00:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
applicable to
 
00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
educators in the public school system is
 
00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
equally applicable
 
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
to the service providers so that's
 
00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:06.640 align:start position:0%
that's the language looking at it i
 
00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:08.320 align:start position:0%
don't see that word following that was
 
00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
just a word that i
 
00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
that i used okay didn't have the
 
00:36:13.829 --> 00:36:13.839 align:start position:0%
significance i thought it was that's
 
00:36:15.589 --> 00:36:15.599 align:start position:0%
okay that's okay my other question is
 
00:36:18.390 --> 00:36:18.400 align:start position:0%
about the scholarship organization
 
00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:23.589 --> 00:36:23.599 align:start position:0%
do they use the same
 
00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
the same set of criminal background
 
00:36:29.109 --> 00:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
checks that the educational systems the
 
00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
educators have to use in public schools
 
00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
and do they
 
00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
check all all the employees of the
 
00:36:38.950 --> 00:36:38.960 align:start position:0%
of the organization as well as the
 
00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
people that they're
 
00:36:43.349 --> 00:36:43.359 align:start position:0%
they're vetting to release the public
 
00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
funds to through the efa
 
00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
i i believe that they do i
 
00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
don't want him to speak so i'm going to
 
00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:53.440 align:start position:0%
do the i will get back to you on that
 
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
exact answer because again i just don't
 
00:36:56.550 --> 00:36:56.560 align:start position:0%
want to
 
00:36:58.950 --> 00:36:58.960 align:start position:0%
to mislead but i believe that when we
 
00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
look at these issues as a department
 
00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
and recognizing the importance of child
 
00:37:05.589 --> 00:37:05.599 align:start position:0%
safety and that's never been in doubt at
 
00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:08.240 align:start position:0%
the department we always refer back to
 
00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
1889 13 a that is our guiding principle
 
00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
and 189 13 b and c were all premised
 
00:37:15.829 --> 00:37:15.839 align:start position:0%
upon that
 
00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
so we use that as our structure and we
 
00:37:19.829 --> 00:37:19.839 align:start position:0%
don't deviate from that
 
00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:23.440 align:start position:0%
um and so i i know when speaking with
 
00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
the commissioner it's been very clear as
 
00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
a policy of the department
 
00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:28.720 align:start position:0%
that's the application and the
 
00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
application is consistent across the
 
00:37:31.829 --> 00:37:31.839 align:start position:0%
board the
 
00:37:33.589 --> 00:37:33.599 align:start position:0%
the implementation
 
00:37:35.829 --> 00:37:35.839 align:start position:0%
right again we're going to defer to
 
00:37:38.069 --> 00:37:38.079 align:start position:0%
these entities to have that policy that
 
00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:40.480 align:start position:0%
is consistent with pursuant to whatever
 
00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
word you want to
 
00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:42.790 align:start position:0%
word you want to
utilize

00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
utilize
 
00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:44.560 align:start position:0%
that law that is the law that we always
 
00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
go back to that is the criminal history
 
00:37:49.109 --> 00:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
background check law so i think that
 
00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
piece of it
 
00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:52.720 align:start position:0%
will always be consistent throughout
 
00:37:55.349 --> 00:37:55.359 align:start position:0%
those programs okay just uh follow up
 
00:37:58.150 --> 00:37:58.160 align:start position:0%
well let's you said two questions oh
 
00:37:59.750 --> 00:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
well this is kind of a follow-up
 
00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:00.630 align:start position:0%
well this is kind of a follow-up
question

00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:00.640 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:02.069 align:start position:0%
question
okay

00:38:02.069 --> 00:38:02.079 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:38:02.079 --> 00:38:02.829 align:start position:0%
okay
so

00:38:02.829 --> 00:38:02.839 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
um one of the issues i i remember
 
00:38:08.069 --> 00:38:08.079 align:start position:0%
dealing with in the past
 
00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
was that for example uh learn everywhere
 
00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:12.470 align:start position:0%
was that for example uh learn everywhere
might

00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
might
 
00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
have a
 
00:38:17.349 --> 00:38:17.359 align:start position:0%
contract with a small business that has
 
00:38:19.990 --> 00:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
employees that that person is working
 
00:38:23.589 --> 00:38:23.599 align:start position:0%
the student is working with and as a
 
00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
person that's an employee of this third
 
00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:27.109 align:start position:0%
person that's an employee of this third
party

00:38:27.109 --> 00:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
party
 
00:38:27.119 --> 00:38:28.310 align:start position:0%
party
they

00:38:28.310 --> 00:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:30.640 align:start position:0%
do routine criminal background checks
 
00:38:32.069 --> 00:38:32.079 align:start position:0%
and credit checks on these people to
 
00:38:33.349 --> 00:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
employ them
 
00:38:35.589 --> 00:38:35.599 align:start position:0%
but their criminal background checks are
 
00:38:38.069 --> 00:38:38.079 align:start position:0%
you know for like stealing and things
 
00:38:41.589 --> 00:38:41.599 align:start position:0%
that they don't they don't flag
 
00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
in particular like trafficking and child
 
00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
sex abuse and you know some of the
 
00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
things that we have it might not be
 
00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
child safety focused right okay not
 
00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
child safety focus
 
00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:52.870 align:start position:0%
child safety focus
um

00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
and so when you say they're following
 
00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:57.200 align:start position:0%
our guidelines are you saying that
 
00:38:57.200 --> 00:38:58.310 align:start position:0%
our guidelines are you saying that
they're

00:38:58.310 --> 00:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
they're
 
00:38:59.910 --> 00:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
doing criminal background checks but
 
00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
we're really not making sure that
 
00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
they're using the criminal background
 
00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
checks that have child safety
 
00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
uh specific child safety um
 
00:39:11.430 --> 00:39:11.440 align:start position:0%
issues involved in it
 
00:39:13.109 --> 00:39:13.119 align:start position:0%
well again speaking of very general
 
00:39:13.119 --> 00:39:15.589 align:start position:0%
well again speaking of very general
terms

00:39:15.589 --> 00:39:15.599 align:start position:0%
terms
 
00:39:17.910 --> 00:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
when the department looks at these
 
00:39:20.069 --> 00:39:20.079 align:start position:0%
programs and implementing them i can
 
00:39:22.069 --> 00:39:22.079 align:start position:0%
tell you that this has been a very
 
00:39:24.069 --> 00:39:24.079 align:start position:0%
robust discussion at the department and
 
00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
these programs are not administered or
 
00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
implemented or started without this
 
00:39:31.109 --> 00:39:31.119 align:start position:0%
being a consideration
 
00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
i can't even begin to count the number
 
00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
of hours that the commissioner i have
 
00:39:36.310 --> 00:39:36.320 align:start position:0%
spent talking about child safety and
 
00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:37.190 align:start position:0%
spent talking about child safety and
again

00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:40.160 align:start position:0%
we always go back to 189 13 a we
 
00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:42.640 align:start position:0%
recognize that individual
 
00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
private entities
 
00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:46.720 align:start position:0%
might not have those child safety
 
00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:47.670 align:start position:0%
might not have those child safety
focused

00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
focused
 
00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:49.109 align:start position:0%
focused
policies

00:39:49.109 --> 00:39:49.119 align:start position:0%
policies
 
00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
and so that is why you see language such
 
00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
as you need to have a policy that is in
 
00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:56.320 align:start position:0%
accordance with
 
00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:57.990 align:start position:0%
accordance with
that

00:39:57.990 --> 00:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:40:00.069 --> 00:40:00.079 align:start position:0%
that criminal record law
 
00:40:02.310 --> 00:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
that guides all of our actions when we
 
00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
look at
 
00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
child safety and working with children
 
00:40:07.829 --> 00:40:07.839 align:start position:0%
so how that's implemented on each
 
00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
individual program
 
00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
i want to get back to you on that
 
00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
because it's very detail-oriented but in
 
00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
in a broad policy sense
 
00:40:18.069 --> 00:40:18.079 align:start position:0%
there is not a certain program that goes
 
00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
by the department that doesn't reference
 
00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
that that law
 
00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:22.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:40:24.069 --> 00:40:24.079 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh represented
 
00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
litchfield did you have a question
 
00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
i did thank you i think you might have
 
00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:32.240 align:start position:0%
answered it just now though um so
 
00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
i think i'm looking for a teachable
 
00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
moment for me selfishly um
 
00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
having sat or i sit currently on a
 
00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
couple of school boards in a very large
 
00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
district and we've gone through these
 
00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
policies that you are we're discussing
 
00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
right now as far as child safety is
 
00:40:49.349 --> 00:40:49.359 align:start position:0%
concerned and we've gone round and round
 
00:40:51.589 --> 00:40:51.599 align:start position:0%
many times about to what extent do we do
 
00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
a background check on the volunteers
 
00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
does it make sense
 
00:40:57.109 --> 00:40:57.119 align:start position:0%
is it cost effective and would it really
 
00:40:59.589 --> 00:40:59.599 align:start position:0%
make it safer for the children so my
 
00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
question is
 
00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
i know rep porter has just mentioned
 
00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
that she's heard some horror stories in
 
00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
her district
 
00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
i know that there are probably
 
00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
a variety of background checks but my
 
00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:14.240 align:start position:0%
question is if we were to actually do
 
00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
these background checks how much
 
00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:17.589 align:start position:0%
these background checks how much
information

00:41:17.589 --> 00:41:17.599 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:41:19.109 --> 00:41:19.119 align:start position:0%
do we actually
 
00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
capture is it only if someone has
 
00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
actually been convicted
 
00:41:25.589 --> 00:41:25.599 align:start position:0%
i'm just curious how effective it is to
 
00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:27.440 align:start position:0%
do these background checks and if it is
 
00:41:29.589 --> 00:41:29.599 align:start position:0%
done through the doe does that impact
 
00:41:31.910 --> 00:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
the liability for the doe and i'm gonna
 
00:41:34.390 --> 00:41:34.400 align:start position:0%
take it even a step further i feel like
 
00:41:36.630 --> 00:41:36.640 align:start position:0%
safety is absolutely important i have
 
00:41:38.710 --> 00:41:38.720 align:start position:0%
four children myself that being said i
 
00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
witness even at church people are afraid
 
00:41:43.349 --> 00:41:43.359 align:start position:0%
to help a child in the restroom because
 
00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
what you know i could be held liable for
 
00:41:47.349 --> 00:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
this so i'm kind of doing a little dump
 
00:41:49.349 --> 00:41:49.359 align:start position:0%
here and hoping you can help me out
 
00:41:50.710 --> 00:41:50.720 align:start position:0%
uh i
 
00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
i think in my past job we'd call that a
 
00:41:54.069 --> 00:41:54.079 align:start position:0%
compound question
 
00:41:56.710 --> 00:41:56.720 align:start position:0%
um but uh well done
 
00:41:58.950 --> 00:41:58.960 align:start position:0%
you did it very well um
 
00:42:01.349 --> 00:42:01.359 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:03.200 align:start position:0%
a couple of things
 
00:42:05.349 --> 00:42:05.359 align:start position:0%
when you look at the law
 
00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
and you look at the section 5 violations
 
00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
which are set out it says if a person is
 
00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
has been convicted
 
00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:14.240 align:start position:0%
or is currently pending disposition for
 
00:42:15.990 --> 00:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
and that's just a fancy word for
 
00:42:17.829 --> 00:42:17.839 align:start position:0%
awaiting trial
 
00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:20.240 align:start position:0%
um and so it captures the conviction and
 
00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
it captures the pre-trial
 
00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
piece of it historically i can tell you
 
00:42:26.829 --> 00:42:26.839 align:start position:0%
when i started with the department in
 
00:42:29.670 --> 00:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
2015 what was being released by the
 
00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
department of safety to the individual
 
00:42:33.109 --> 00:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
school districts because the department
 
00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
of ed was not playing a role in this
 
00:42:36.309 --> 00:42:36.319 align:start position:0%
issue at that time
 
00:42:38.309 --> 00:42:38.319 align:start position:0%
was simply a letter
 
00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:40.720 align:start position:0%
and the letter simply said the person
 
00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
has a
 
00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:46.160 align:start position:0%
section five conviction or they don't
 
00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
and i can tell you when i first saw this
 
00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:50.640 align:start position:0%
letter i i said what what is this
 
00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:52.240 align:start position:0%
because i had come from a very different
 
00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
world a very different background where
 
00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
as a criminal prosecutor you got
 
00:42:58.630 --> 00:42:58.640 align:start position:0%
someone's entire criminal history and so
 
00:43:00.790 --> 00:43:00.800 align:start position:0%
it was very shocking to me
 
00:43:02.950 --> 00:43:02.960 align:start position:0%
and school districts were relying on
 
00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
this letter and not really realizing
 
00:43:06.390 --> 00:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
that there's a lot of information
 
00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:08.720 align:start position:0%
potentially in someone's criminal
 
00:43:10.309 --> 00:43:10.319 align:start position:0%
history and what i mean by that is there
 
00:43:13.030 --> 00:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
are a lot of different dispositions
 
00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
you can be arrested for something and
 
00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:18.160 align:start position:0%
have it be placed on file or pending or
 
00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
in massachusetts they do a conviction
 
00:43:21.670 --> 00:43:21.680 align:start position:0%
without a finding and i still don't know
 
00:43:24.550 --> 00:43:24.560 align:start position:0%
what that is um but there's all these
 
00:43:26.790 --> 00:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
different variations on a theme if you
 
00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:27.510 align:start position:0%
different variations on a theme if you
will

00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:43:30.309 --> 00:43:30.319 align:start position:0%
and what happened sadly is that we had a
 
00:43:30.319 --> 00:43:31.910 align:start position:0%
and what happened sadly is that we had a
case

00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
case
 
00:43:33.829 --> 00:43:33.839 align:start position:0%
out in the western part of the state
 
00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
where an individual was charged with
 
00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
really severe
 
00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:40.160 align:start position:0%
sex offenses against a child and for
 
00:43:42.470 --> 00:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
whatever reason those charges were
 
00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
reduced down put out
 
00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:46.880 align:start position:0%
and i can't speak to the reason behind
 
00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:47.589 align:start position:0%
and i can't speak to the reason behind
it

00:43:47.589 --> 00:43:47.599 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:43:49.829 --> 00:43:49.839 align:start position:0%
and when that person applied for a job
 
00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
in a school
 
00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:52.480 align:start position:0%
they were subject to the criminal
 
00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
background check just like everyone else
 
00:43:56.630 --> 00:43:56.640 align:start position:0%
pursuant to that law
 
00:43:58.470 --> 00:43:58.480 align:start position:0%
and the department of safety pursuant to
 
00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
the law at the time released a letter
 
00:44:02.309 --> 00:44:02.319 align:start position:0%
that said the person did not have any
 
00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:04.880 align:start position:0%
section 5 violations because they didn't
 
00:44:07.349 --> 00:44:07.359 align:start position:0%
the offenses had been pled down
 
00:44:09.829 --> 00:44:09.839 align:start position:0%
and that victim was brave enough so he
 
00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:12.160 align:start position:0%
was employed in the school and
 
00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:13.670 align:start position:0%
was employed in the school and
reoffended

00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
reoffended
 
00:44:15.109 --> 00:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
that victim was brave enough to come
 
00:44:17.349 --> 00:44:17.359 align:start position:0%
before this committee this house and
 
00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
testify to her experience and it was
 
00:44:22.230 --> 00:44:22.240 align:start position:0%
this legislative body that changed the
 
00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
law to allow for the release of
 
00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
all offenses
 
00:44:28.870 --> 00:44:28.880 align:start position:0%
and now you'll see misdemeanors and
 
00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
felonies which is why section 5 says
 
00:44:33.349 --> 00:44:33.359 align:start position:0%
that each school district can create a
 
00:44:33.359 --> 00:44:34.550 align:start position:0%
that each school district can create a
policy

00:44:34.550 --> 00:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
policy
 
00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
which allows them to take into
 
00:44:37.829 --> 00:44:37.839 align:start position:0%
consideration offenses that fall outside
 
00:44:40.069 --> 00:44:40.079 align:start position:0%
the section five violations
 
00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:42.880 align:start position:0%
last legislative sect um session or it
 
00:44:44.470 --> 00:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
might have been the one before i got to
 
00:44:45.990 --> 00:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
be honest with you the two kind of blend
 
00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
together do the pandemic so i don't know
 
00:44:50.550 --> 00:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
which year it was but most recently
 
00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
the law was amended again to allow for
 
00:44:57.430 --> 00:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
the complete release which goes beyond
 
00:44:59.589 --> 00:44:59.599 align:start position:0%
just convictions so you will see things
 
00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
that were null process which means the
 
00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
state dismissed the charges and so
 
00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
school districts um
 
00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:08.800 align:start position:0%
are now receiving the entire record
 
00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:11.109 align:start position:0%
are now receiving the entire record
uh

00:45:11.109 --> 00:45:11.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
people can debate
 
00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
i will always say and i've said it
 
00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
before when you're dealing with children
 
00:45:21.430 --> 00:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
it's good to have all the information so
 
00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:23.200 align:start position:0%
you can make a well-informed choice we
 
00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
are not hiring people to put widgets in
 
00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
a box we're hiring people to put be
 
00:45:28.550 --> 00:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
around children so the more information
 
00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
the better and i will give significant
 
00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
credit to representative mullen who
 
00:45:34.550 --> 00:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
passed a law that requires the
 
00:45:37.109 --> 00:45:37.119 align:start position:0%
department of ed to do trainings for
 
00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
districts on criminal histories and we
 
00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:40.240 align:start position:0%
have been doing that throughout the
 
00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:42.720 align:start position:0%
state on a routine basis and every time
 
00:45:45.030 --> 00:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
i do one i call representative mullen
 
00:45:48.069 --> 00:45:48.079 align:start position:0%
and say law in action i just did your
 
00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
training uh so we've we
 
00:45:52.309 --> 00:45:52.319 align:start position:0%
have been out doing those with the
 
00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
department of safety and we've been
 
00:45:56.470 --> 00:45:56.480 align:start position:0%
getting a lot of requests on that to
 
00:45:58.390 --> 00:45:58.400 align:start position:0%
provide that information so it's again a
 
00:46:00.630 --> 00:46:00.640 align:start position:0%
nice partnership with the department and
 
00:46:02.710 --> 00:46:02.720 align:start position:0%
the districts to say
 
00:46:04.870 --> 00:46:04.880 align:start position:0%
we live in a new world now right we
 
00:46:07.109 --> 00:46:07.119 align:start position:0%
can't rely on a letter that says no
 
00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:09.200 align:start position:0%
section 5 violation or yes there is no
 
00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
there isn't we have to have this
 
00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
information we recognize how critically
 
00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
important it is and the department
 
00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:16.640 align:start position:0%
recognizes how critically important it
 
00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
is and we put that emphasis into all
 
00:46:20.550 --> 00:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
these various programs that we're doing
 
00:46:22.150 --> 00:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
in these initiatives that are going
 
00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:23.910 align:start position:0%
in these initiatives that are going
forward

00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:26.560 align:start position:0%
you asked about liability
 
00:46:28.150 --> 00:46:28.160 align:start position:0%
there's criminal liability and there's
 
00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
civil liability
 
00:46:31.349 --> 00:46:31.359 align:start position:0%
and there's a significant difference
 
00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
between the two i'm not really here to
 
00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
opine on it
 
00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:36.150 align:start position:0%
opine on it
um

00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:36.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:38.390 align:start position:0%
um
but

00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:46:41.270 --> 00:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
is it a possibility of a lawsuit
 
00:46:44.550 --> 00:46:44.560 align:start position:0%
yes lawsuits are possible um
 
00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
i i don't know how much deeper i can go
 
00:46:49.109 --> 00:46:49.119 align:start position:0%
on that um and i don't mean to be
 
00:46:50.309 --> 00:46:50.319 align:start position:0%
flipper or
 
00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
disrespectful but it is a pretty broad
 
00:46:55.270 --> 00:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
topic and perhaps
 
00:46:57.990 --> 00:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
worthy of a conversation offline um but
 
00:46:59.430 --> 00:46:59.440 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the opportunity for the
 
00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:00.309 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the opportunity for the
question

00:47:00.309 --> 00:47:00.319 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:47:02.150 --> 00:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much uh are
 
00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:03.030 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much uh are
there

00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
further questions i want to you know
 
00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
sort of like slow down these questions a
 
00:47:07.990 --> 00:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
little overlapping the other this is
 
00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:10.240 align:start position:0%
technical support we can get that for
 
00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
the committee even after this particular
 
00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:13.589 align:start position:0%
the committee even after this particular
hearing

00:47:13.589 --> 00:47:13.599 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:47:13.599 --> 00:47:15.829 align:start position:0%
hearing
representative

00:47:15.829 --> 00:47:15.839 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
00:47:21.829 --> 00:47:21.839 align:start position:0%
attorney fenton uh you referenced in a
 
00:47:24.309 --> 00:47:24.319 align:start position:0%
in conversation this morning that you
 
00:47:26.549 --> 00:47:26.559 align:start position:0%
and the commissioner always talk about
 
00:47:29.190 --> 00:47:29.200 align:start position:0%
student safety whenever new programs are
 
00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
coming online
 
00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:34.160 align:start position:0%
has a conversation taken place between
 
00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
you and the commissioner regarding
 
00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
educational service providers in the efa
 
00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:41.349 align:start position:0%
educational service providers in the efa
program

00:47:41.349 --> 00:47:41.359 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
and if so
 
00:47:46.470 --> 00:47:46.480 align:start position:0%
are there going to be rules written or
 
00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
uh what what would
 
00:47:51.109 --> 00:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
what's the department recommending in
 
00:47:53.190 --> 00:47:53.200 align:start position:0%
terms of the process for checking out
 
00:47:56.150 --> 00:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
the backgrounds of the esps
 
00:47:58.309 --> 00:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
sure and i'm going to put the details of
 
00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
that into the same bucket i did with
 
00:48:02.069 --> 00:48:02.079 align:start position:0%
representative luno
 
00:48:03.750 --> 00:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
i can get back to you with those details
 
00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:05.030 align:start position:0%
i can get back to you with those details
but

00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
the short answer is yes in every
 
00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
initiative we undertake we always have
 
00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:10.480 align:start position:0%
that conversation and that is always
 
00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
paramount um
 
00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:13.270 align:start position:0%
paramount um
and

00:48:13.270 --> 00:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
what it looks like in every program
 
00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
might vary a little bit but it's always
 
00:48:18.630 --> 00:48:18.640 align:start position:0%
going to come back to that same law that
 
00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
we've been discussing that is our
 
00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
gutting principle
 
00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
and it's just a question of how we apply
 
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:27.589 align:start position:0%
and it's just a question of how we apply
it

00:48:27.589 --> 00:48:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:29.109 --> 00:48:29.119 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:48:29.119 --> 00:48:30.309 align:start position:0%
thank you
good

00:48:30.309 --> 00:48:30.319 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:48:31.349 --> 00:48:31.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:48:31.359 --> 00:48:32.309 align:start position:0%
thank you
and

00:48:32.309 --> 00:48:32.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:48:36.549 --> 00:48:36.559 align:start position:0%
do we need to put something into law do
 
00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:38.960 align:start position:0%
we need to codify
 
00:48:43.589 --> 00:48:43.599 align:start position:0%
189 a as part of the efa program
 
00:48:45.030 --> 00:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
to be sure
 
00:48:48.309 --> 00:48:48.319 align:start position:0%
that people that are employed as as
 
00:48:50.309 --> 00:48:50.319 align:start position:0%
vendors or providers or contractors
 
00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
whatever we want to call them
 
00:49:03.030 --> 00:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:04.630 --> 00:49:04.640 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:06.640 align:start position:0%
whether or not it's codified in the
 
00:49:09.829 --> 00:49:09.839 align:start position:0%
statute is really beyond my pay grade
 
00:49:12.069 --> 00:49:12.079 align:start position:0%
regardless of what title this committee
 
00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
continues to give me at various times
 
00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:16.549 align:start position:0%
continues to give me at various times
um

00:49:16.549 --> 00:49:16.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:18.390 --> 00:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
but that's what the rulemaking is for
 
00:49:19.670 --> 00:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
and that's what we've seen in the learn
 
00:49:22.549 --> 00:49:22.559 align:start position:0%
everywhere program so there's there's
 
00:49:24.549 --> 00:49:24.559 align:start position:0%
there are avenues by which the
 
00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
department can and does successfully
 
00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:28.950 align:start position:0%
department can and does successfully
implement

00:49:28.950 --> 00:49:28.960 align:start position:0%
implement
 
00:49:31.670 --> 00:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
the reference to the statute
 
00:49:33.829 --> 00:49:33.839 align:start position:0%
whether or not this committee wants to
 
00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
codify it in in the statute
 
00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:37.109 align:start position:0%
codify it in in the statute
is

00:49:37.109 --> 00:49:37.119 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:49:39.990 --> 00:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
within your purview to do so but just
 
00:49:41.510 --> 00:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
because it's not
 
00:49:43.030 --> 00:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
codified in the statute doesn't mean
 
00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:44.720 align:start position:0%
it's not implemented it can be
 
00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
implemented in other ways via the
 
00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
rulemaking process and we've seen that
 
00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:50.470 align:start position:0%
rulemaking process and we've seen that
throughout

00:49:50.470 --> 00:49:50.480 align:start position:0%
throughout
 
00:49:52.710 --> 00:49:52.720 align:start position:0%
and we've seen that in relation to
 
00:49:54.150 --> 00:49:54.160 align:start position:0%
another bill which we've been dealing
 
00:49:56.790 --> 00:49:56.800 align:start position:0%
with this year is do we put something in
 
00:49:59.589 --> 00:49:59.599 align:start position:0%
statute or do we work through rule
 
00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
and that's that's a good question it has
 
00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of uh detail we have to look at
 
00:50:06.549 --> 00:50:06.559 align:start position:0%
because at times it's wiser to work
 
00:50:08.790 --> 00:50:08.800 align:start position:0%
through rule rule can be changed quicker
 
00:50:10.470 --> 00:50:10.480 align:start position:0%
than statute can be
 
00:50:12.710 --> 00:50:12.720 align:start position:0%
and and so there's a lot more to it and
 
00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:14.480 align:start position:0%
we discussed that in terms of one other
 
00:50:16.950 --> 00:50:16.960 align:start position:0%
area which we involved several folks on
 
00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:18.640 align:start position:0%
earlier not more than a week and a half
 
00:50:20.309 --> 00:50:20.319 align:start position:0%
two weeks ago
 
00:50:24.829 --> 00:50:24.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:27.910 --> 00:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
representatives yes i have two questions
 
00:50:29.910 --> 00:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
one is i remember when we tried to do
 
00:50:31.349 --> 00:50:31.359 align:start position:0%
this before
 
00:50:33.270 --> 00:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:50:35.109 --> 00:50:35.119 align:start position:0%
as you've said a lot of things have
 
00:50:35.119 --> 00:50:36.309 align:start position:0%
as you've said a lot of things have
changed

00:50:36.309 --> 00:50:36.319 align:start position:0%
changed
 
00:50:38.950 --> 00:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
since then and i'm wondering did
 
00:50:41.910 --> 00:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
anything ever change or happen
 
00:50:45.109 --> 00:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
at the department concerning um
 
00:50:47.589 --> 00:50:47.599 align:start position:0%
like tutors who might teach lots of
 
00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
different places is there does the
 
00:50:51.109 --> 00:50:51.119 align:start position:0%
department now have
 
00:50:53.109 --> 00:50:53.119 align:start position:0%
a way for them to
 
00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
you know like a list or whatever a way
 
00:50:57.270 --> 00:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
for them to do one
 
00:51:00.309 --> 00:51:00.319 align:start position:0%
background check that the department has
 
00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
or would we still have to do
 
00:51:04.950 --> 00:51:04.960 align:start position:0%
a background check every time we have a
 
00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
new student
 
00:51:10.230 --> 00:51:10.240 align:start position:0%
so currently that particular scenario
 
00:51:11.829 --> 00:51:11.839 align:start position:0%
would be dealt with as an employment
 
00:51:13.829 --> 00:51:13.839 align:start position:0%
matter that would not be something that
 
00:51:15.270 --> 00:51:15.280 align:start position:0%
falls within the jurisdiction of the
 
00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
department of education our authority is
 
00:51:22.309 --> 00:51:22.319 align:start position:0%
enumerated quite clearly in 189 13 b and
 
00:51:22.319 --> 00:51:23.670 align:start position:0%
enumerated quite clearly in 189 13 b and
13c

00:51:23.670 --> 00:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
13c
 
00:51:27.030 --> 00:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
and it does not at this time
 
00:51:28.309 --> 00:51:28.319 align:start position:0%
involve tutors
 
00:51:28.319 --> 00:51:29.430 align:start position:0%
involve tutors
okay

00:51:29.430 --> 00:51:29.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:51:32.710 --> 00:51:32.720 align:start position:0%
and and the other one is just from a
 
00:51:34.790 --> 00:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
legal perspective
 
00:51:38.390 --> 00:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
i don't really understand
 
00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:39.589 align:start position:0%
i don't really understand
uh

00:51:39.589 --> 00:51:39.599 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:51:41.990 --> 00:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
section one
 
00:51:45.430 --> 00:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
and who exactly i mean volun any
 
00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
employee or volunteer of an entity
 
00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
contracted for educational services by
 
00:51:53.190 --> 00:51:53.200 align:start position:0%
the department it's like
 
00:51:58.390 --> 00:51:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:04.390 --> 00:52:04.400 align:start position:0%
well i will reference the previous
 
00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
testimony i gave as it pertained to the
 
00:52:09.670 --> 00:52:09.680 align:start position:0%
fiscal note um
 
00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:10.950 align:start position:0%
fiscal note um
in

00:52:10.950 --> 00:52:10.960 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:52:12.790 --> 00:52:12.800 align:start position:0%
in answering the fiscal note and writing
 
00:52:15.670 --> 00:52:15.680 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note i i grappled with the
 
00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
the piece that this language that you
 
00:52:20.069 --> 00:52:20.079 align:start position:0%
refer to and i will refer to as well
 
00:52:22.710 --> 00:52:22.720 align:start position:0%
lines three through six
 
00:52:25.109 --> 00:52:25.119 align:start position:0%
i found to be overly broad and i wasn't
 
00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
sure who it
 
00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
i wasn't sure how to quantify it and how
 
00:52:30.829 --> 00:52:30.839 align:start position:0%
to address it
 
00:52:33.349 --> 00:52:33.359 align:start position:0%
um and that's why we put down that it
 
00:52:35.349 --> 00:52:35.359 align:start position:0%
was indeterminable because i felt that
 
00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
this could be in it could be read a
 
00:52:40.950 --> 00:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
variety of ways and it was very um
 
00:52:43.270 --> 00:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
very large that pool was was very large
 
00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:44.710 align:start position:0%
very large that pool was was very large
potentially

00:52:44.710 --> 00:52:44.720 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
00:52:46.870 --> 00:52:46.880 align:start position:0%
depending on your interpretation thank
 
00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:47.990 align:start position:0%
depending on your interpretation thank
you

00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:52:49.109 --> 00:52:49.119 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much
 
00:52:51.670 --> 00:52:51.680 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock yes
 
00:52:53.670 --> 00:52:53.680 align:start position:0%
well i think thank you training i just
 
00:52:54.870 --> 00:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
want to thank you for coming forward and
 
00:52:56.230 --> 00:52:56.240 align:start position:0%
answering my questions
 
00:52:58.870 --> 00:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
you're very welcome
 
00:53:04.230 --> 00:53:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:05.030 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:53:06.549 --> 00:53:06.559 align:start position:0%
i'm not as familiar with this as other
 
00:53:07.910 --> 00:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
members of the committee giving my
 
00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:10.240 align:start position:0%
temporary status but what i think i'm
 
00:53:12.150 --> 00:53:12.160 align:start position:0%
hearing you say is at least part of this
 
00:53:14.309 --> 00:53:14.319 align:start position:0%
bill codify stuff that's already in the
 
00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
rules am i hearing that correctly
 
00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:18.630 align:start position:0%
rules am i hearing that correctly
yes

00:53:18.630 --> 00:53:18.640 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:53:27.510 --> 00:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
i would have to look at the efa rules
 
00:53:32.950 --> 00:53:32.960 align:start position:0%
and then we can puzzle it out from there
 
00:53:34.790 --> 00:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
okay that's fair and i'm happy to get
 
00:53:36.470 --> 00:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
back to you on that but
 
00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:37.589 align:start position:0%
back to you on that but
again

00:53:37.589 --> 00:53:37.599 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:53:38.710 --> 00:53:38.720 align:start position:0%
all the
 
00:53:40.309 --> 00:53:40.319 align:start position:0%
the programs that we do
 
00:53:42.870 --> 00:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
we incorporate the reference the
 
00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
criminal history reference check um so
 
00:53:48.630 --> 00:53:48.640 align:start position:0%
yes we can we can pull those sections of
 
00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
the rule and line them up and see which
 
00:53:52.870 --> 00:53:52.880 align:start position:0%
ones are are redundant or already
 
00:53:54.790 --> 00:53:54.800 align:start position:0%
incorporated but yes the short answer to
 
00:53:56.710 --> 00:53:56.720 align:start position:0%
your question is it's incorporated
 
00:53:56.720 --> 00:53:57.910 align:start position:0%
your question is it's incorporated
already

00:53:57.910 --> 00:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:54:00.150 --> 00:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes but even if they're
 
00:54:02.549 --> 00:54:02.559 align:start position:0%
already in rules there is a reason to
 
00:54:03.990 --> 00:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
codify this
 
00:54:05.829 --> 00:54:05.839 align:start position:0%
as well i mean there's a reason we
 
00:54:07.589 --> 00:54:07.599 align:start position:0%
codify things beyond what's in the rules
 
00:54:08.710 --> 00:54:08.720 align:start position:0%
so just because they're in the rules
 
00:54:10.150 --> 00:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean this shouldn't be passed
 
00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:11.510 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean this shouldn't be passed
necessarily

00:54:11.510 --> 00:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
00:54:13.190 --> 00:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you agree that there could be
 
00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
additional implications if we codify
 
00:54:15.040 --> 00:54:21.589 align:start position:0%
additional implications if we codify
this

00:54:21.589 --> 00:54:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:24.309 --> 00:54:24.319 align:start position:0%
two lawyers battle it out in the ring if
 
00:54:25.829 --> 00:54:25.839 align:start position:0%
i didn't know you were a lawyer before i
 
00:54:26.790 --> 00:54:26.800 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
00:54:29.430 --> 00:54:29.440 align:start position:0%
i'll withdraw the question
 
00:54:31.109 --> 00:54:31.119 align:start position:0%
i think that um
 
00:54:33.829 --> 00:54:33.839 align:start position:0%
you know this this legislative body
 
00:54:36.230 --> 00:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
will have its reasons to to codify it in
 
00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
the statute whether or not i agree with
 
00:54:40.309 --> 00:54:40.319 align:start position:0%
that is irrelevant
 
00:54:42.069 --> 00:54:42.079 align:start position:0%
but yes it would have certain
 
00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
implications if you were to codify in
 
00:54:45.190 --> 00:54:45.200 align:start position:0%
the law thank you
 
00:54:48.309 --> 00:54:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:52.230 --> 00:54:52.240 align:start position:0%
that discussion can go on forever
 
00:54:54.309 --> 00:54:54.319 align:start position:0%
and i'm married to a lawyer so it's just
 
00:54:55.990 --> 00:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
must be fun at breakfast and lunch and
 
00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:56.870 align:start position:0%
must be fun at breakfast and lunch and
dinner

00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
dinner
 
00:54:58.710 --> 00:54:58.720 align:start position:0%
so am i and believe me
 
00:55:00.789 --> 00:55:00.799 align:start position:0%
the first grade teachers also okay i
 
00:55:02.150 --> 00:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
think what we're going to do this this
 
00:55:04.789 --> 00:55:04.799 align:start position:0%
bill right here is not an early bill
 
00:55:05.990 --> 00:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
we have to have it out of this committee
 
00:55:08.309 --> 00:55:08.319 align:start position:0%
by on march by march 10th
 
00:55:09.829 --> 00:55:09.839 align:start position:0%
so there's a little bit of time to
 
00:55:11.990 --> 00:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of questions asked
 
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:12.870 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of questions asked
here

00:55:12.870 --> 00:55:12.880 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:55:15.190 --> 00:55:15.200 align:start position:0%
and it might be wise for us to just
 
00:55:17.270 --> 00:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
consider a committee the whole
 
00:55:19.270 --> 00:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work session
 
00:55:21.670 --> 00:55:21.680 align:start position:0%
somewhere along the way here and give
 
00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
some time for the department to come
 
00:55:25.349 --> 00:55:25.359 align:start position:0%
back with some of the responses to what
 
00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:27.200 align:start position:0%
we've asked and then we can have further
 
00:55:29.990 --> 00:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
discussion at that particular moment
 
00:55:31.910 --> 00:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
so rather than
 
00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:33.440 align:start position:0%
having more questions to you right now
 
00:55:35.910 --> 00:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
attorney fenton colonel fenton governor
 
00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:36.950 align:start position:0%
attorney fenton colonel fenton governor
fenton

00:55:36.950 --> 00:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
fenton
 
00:55:39.349 --> 00:55:39.359 align:start position:0%
i would also suggest that we involve our
 
00:55:41.030 --> 00:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
partners at the department of safety
 
00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
because they have been really critical
 
00:55:44.950 --> 00:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
in this i think it'd be wise thank you
 
00:55:46.630 --> 00:55:46.640 align:start position:0%
thank you we'll try and set something
 
00:55:49.270 --> 00:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
like that up and working with you
 
00:55:51.510 --> 00:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
so with that we have no more pink cards
 
00:55:53.510 --> 00:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
on this particular bill so we're going
 
00:55:56.630 --> 00:55:56.640 align:start position:0%
to close this hearing
 
00:55:58.470 --> 00:55:58.480 align:start position:0%
and we'll move into the next bill which
 
00:56:00.829 --> 00:56:00.839 align:start position:0%
is on the docket that is
 
00:56:00.839 --> 00:56:02.630 align:start position:0%
is on the docket that is

number one
 
00:58:05.750 --> 00:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
and this is again the process
 
00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
taking you through the process
 
00:58:11.589 --> 00:58:11.599 align:start position:0%
in this bill of how this would work
 
00:58:13.589 --> 00:58:13.599 align:start position:0%
school districts
 
00:58:13.599 --> 00:58:15.510 align:start position:0%
school districts
considering

00:58:15.510 --> 00:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
considering
 
00:58:18.870 --> 00:58:18.880 align:start position:0%
submitting questions of authorizing
 
00:58:21.990 --> 00:58:22.000 align:start position:0%
bonded indebtedness
 
00:58:24.710 --> 00:58:24.720 align:start position:0%
shall invite
 
00:58:26.789 --> 00:58:26.799 align:start position:0%
chartered public schools
 
00:58:30.390 --> 00:58:30.400 align:start position:0%
to participate in discussions
 
00:58:34.470 --> 00:58:34.480 align:start position:0%
and are encouraged keyword there
 
00:58:36.950 --> 00:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
to voluntarily include
 
00:58:39.510 --> 00:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
funding for capital construction needs
 
00:58:41.990 --> 00:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
of chartered public schools
 
00:58:44.630 --> 00:58:44.640 align:start position:0%
in the district's question
 
00:58:48.470 --> 00:58:48.480 align:start position:0%
of authorizing bonded indebtedness
 
00:58:49.430 --> 00:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:58:52.069 --> 00:58:52.079 align:start position:0%
side note away from my script here this
 
00:58:53.750 --> 00:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
is probably the most important point of
 
00:58:55.910 --> 00:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
the bill is that the school district
 
00:58:58.230 --> 00:58:58.240 align:start position:0%
offer the invitation
 
00:59:01.589 --> 00:59:01.599 align:start position:0%
to the public chartered school in their

00:59:05.670 --> 00:59:05.680 align:start position:0%
to be part of the discussion
 
00:59:09.030 --> 00:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
if a bond question will go on
 
00:59:11.270 --> 00:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
the ballot
 
00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:12.390 align:start position:0%

00:59:12.390 --> 00:59:12.400 align:start position:0%

00:59:13.589 --> 00:59:13.599 align:start position:0%
point there to open lines of
 
00:59:13.599 --> 00:59:15.190 align:start position:0%
point there to open lines of
communication

00:59:15.190 --> 00:59:15.200 align:start position:0%
communication
 
00:59:17.030 --> 00:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
number two
 
00:59:18.870 --> 00:59:18.880 align:start position:0%
if the chartered public school has
 
00:59:20.950 --> 00:59:20.960 align:start position:0%
construction needs
 
00:59:23.190 --> 00:59:23.200 align:start position:0%
it may request that the local school
 
00:59:25.829 --> 00:59:25.839 align:start position:0%
board include it as part of a ballot
 
00:59:25.839 --> 00:59:26.870 align:start position:0%

the voters
 
00:59:34.470 --> 00:59:34.480 align:start position:0%
and the chartered public school
 
00:59:36.230 --> 00:59:36.240 align:start position:0%
in that conversation with the school
 
00:59:39.270 --> 00:59:39.280 align:start position:0%
district that has construction needs
 
00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:40.789 align:start position:0%
district that has construction needs
must

00:59:40.789 --> 00:59:40.799 align:start position:0%

00:59:47.270 --> 00:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
to the school district board that
 
00:59:50.630 --> 00:59:50.640 align:start position:0%
includes specified items
 
00:59:53.430 --> 00:59:53.440 align:start position:0%
those specified items are in sections
 
00:59:55.589 --> 00:59:55.599 align:start position:0%
one through eight
 
00:59:57.349 --> 00:59:57.359 align:start position:0%
in the bill
 
00:59:59.109 --> 00:59:59.119 align:start position:0%
section roman two
 
01:00:02.870 --> 01:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:05.109 --> 01:00:05.119 align:start position:0%
the school board now
 
01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
shall notify the chartered public school
 
01:00:09.349 --> 01:00:09.359 align:start position:0%

the capital construction needs for
 
01:00:18.950 --> 01:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
inclusion in the ballot question
 
01:00:20.470 --> 01:00:20.480 align:start position:0%
this gives the school board the
 
01:00:23.670 --> 01:00:23.680 align:start position:0%
authority to accept or reject
 
01:00:28.230 --> 01:00:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:30.150 --> 01:00:30.160 align:start position:0%
then i break it down into two scenarios
 
01:00:32.069 --> 01:00:32.079 align:start position:0%
my items four and five in the written
 
01:00:32.079 --> 01:00:33.589 align:start position:0%

01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
scenario one
 
01:00:38.150 --> 01:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
if the school district accepts
 
01:00:40.069 --> 01:00:40.079 align:start position:0%
the chartered schools
 
01:00:40.079 --> 01:00:42.470 align:start position:0%
the chartered schools
needs

01:00:42.470 --> 01:00:42.480 align:start position:0%
needs
 
01:00:44.069 --> 01:00:44.079 align:start position:0%
the chartered public school capital
 
01:00:45.990 --> 01:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
construction needs shall be included in
 
01:00:48.069 --> 01:00:48.079 align:start position:0%
the same ballot questions submitted by
 
01:00:50.789 --> 01:00:50.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:52.789 --> 01:00:52.799 align:start position:0%
in scenario 2
 
01:00:56.630 --> 01:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
if not accepted the school board says no
 
01:00:58.069 --> 01:00:58.079 align:start position:0%
to the chartered public school
 
01:00:59.910 --> 01:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
construction needs
 
01:01:01.750 --> 01:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
then the chartered public school has an
 
01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:03.030 align:start position:0%
then the chartered public school has an
opportunity

01:01:03.030 --> 01:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
01:01:05.349 --> 01:01:05.359 align:start position:0%

01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:13.990 align:start position:0%
 
additionally

01:01:13.990 --> 01:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
additionally
 
01:01:15.510 --> 01:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
the bill allows for alternative
 
01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
financial plans
 
01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
whereby school districts and chartered
 
01:01:21.190 --> 01:01:21.200 align:start position:0%
public schools may
 
01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:22.230 align:start position:0%

01:01:24.870 --> 01:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
to an alternative financial plan
 
01:01:27.030 --> 01:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
addressing facility needs
 
01:01:30.390 --> 01:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
for benefit of chartered public schools
 
01:01:32.950 --> 01:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
such plans could include and this is
 
01:01:35.270 --> 01:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
text taken from the bill
 
01:01:38.069 --> 01:01:38.079 align:start position:0%
retiring financial obligations
 
01:01:40.549 --> 01:01:40.559 align:start position:0%
previously issued for the benefit of the
 
01:01:43.750 --> 01:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
chartered public school
 
01:01:46.230 --> 01:01:46.240 align:start position:0%
the final section of the bill
 
01:01:48.230 --> 01:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
so that is section
 
01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:51.349 align:start position:0%
so that is section
2

01:01:51.349 --> 01:01:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:54.069 --> 01:01:54.079 align:start position:0%

to the process of bond issue
 
01:02:00.789 --> 01:02:00.799 align:start position:0%
this is the same section stating that
 
01:02:02.789 --> 01:02:02.799 align:start position:0%
the state is not liable for any debt or
 
01:02:05.670 --> 01:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
other obligation
 
01:02:08.630 --> 01:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
now for my concluding remarks
 
01:02:09.910 --> 01:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:02:12.630 --> 01:02:12.640 align:start position:0%
strengthens communication
 
01:02:14.710 --> 01:02:14.720 align:start position:0%
between school districts
 
01:02:17.270 --> 01:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
and chartered public schools
 
01:02:18.870 --> 01:02:18.880 align:start position:0%
again i bring you back to number one in
 
01:02:21.270 --> 01:02:21.280 align:start position:0%
my testimony here the conversation
 
01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:22.870 align:start position:0%
my testimony here the conversation
begins

01:02:22.870 --> 01:02:22.880 align:start position:0%
begins
 
01:02:24.789 --> 01:02:24.799 align:start position:0%
the school district
 
01:02:26.309 --> 01:02:26.319 align:start position:0%
and the chartered public school within
 
01:02:29.109 --> 01:02:29.119 align:start position:0%
the district are in conversation about
 
01:02:31.190 --> 01:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
building and construction
 
01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:32.549 align:start position:0%
building and construction
needs

01:02:32.549 --> 01:02:32.559 align:start position:0%
needs
 
01:02:34.710 --> 01:02:34.720 align:start position:0%
chartered public schools are public
 
01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:35.829 align:start position:0%
chartered public schools are public
schools

01:02:35.829 --> 01:02:35.839 align:start position:0%
schools
 
01:02:37.990 --> 01:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
they have needs just like
 
01:02:39.910 --> 01:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
traditional public schools for lack of a
 
01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:40.950 align:start position:0%
traditional public schools for lack of a
phrase

01:02:40.950 --> 01:02:40.960 align:start position:0%
phrase
 
01:02:43.589 --> 01:02:43.599 align:start position:0%
that includes construction costs this
 
01:02:44.950 --> 01:02:44.960 align:start position:0%
bill would bring them into the
 
01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:47.430 align:start position:0%
bill would bring them into the
discussion

01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:47.440 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:02:49.270 --> 01:02:49.280 align:start position:0%
this bill also provides options for
 
01:02:51.589 --> 01:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
funding capital construction costs for
 
01:02:53.510 --> 01:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
chartered schools
 
01:02:55.109 --> 01:02:55.119 align:start position:0%
being part of a bond
 
01:02:57.829 --> 01:02:57.839 align:start position:0%
process if the school board
 
01:02:57.839 --> 01:02:59.990 align:start position:0%
process if the school board
determines

01:02:59.990 --> 01:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
determines
 
01:03:02.470 --> 01:03:02.480 align:start position:0%
it's good
 
01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:03.430 align:start position:0%
it's good
and

01:03:03.430 --> 01:03:03.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:03:05.990 --> 01:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
lastly this bill will clarify whether or
 
01:03:07.750 --> 01:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
not chartered public schools are even
 
01:03:11.430 --> 01:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
allowed to process to participate
 
01:03:13.589 --> 01:03:13.599 align:start position:0%
in the bond process
 
01:03:16.549 --> 01:03:16.559 align:start position:0%
because that is unclear in current law
 
01:03:17.910 --> 01:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
and with that
 
01:03:20.069 --> 01:03:20.079 align:start position:0%
i want to thank you for your attention
 
01:03:21.750 --> 01:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
i want to thank you for your service to
 
01:03:22.870 --> 01:03:22.880 align:start position:0%
our state
 
01:03:24.309 --> 01:03:24.319 align:start position:0%
i believe this will be the last bill
 
01:03:25.589 --> 01:03:25.599 align:start position:0%
i'll introduce in this committee this
 
01:03:25.599 --> 01:03:26.950 align:start position:0%
i'll introduce in this committee this
year

01:03:26.950 --> 01:03:26.960 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:03:29.349 --> 01:03:29.359 align:start position:0%
uh and i want to thank you again mr
 
01:03:31.270 --> 01:03:31.280 align:start position:0%

are there questions from the committee
 
01:03:37.910 --> 01:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:39.910 --> 01:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
so if i representative mooney if i'm
 
01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
understanding this you're asking
 
01:03:44.150 --> 01:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
a local school district to take on
 
01:03:47.109 --> 01:03:47.119 align:start position:0%
responsibility for a bond for a school
 
01:03:49.589 --> 01:03:49.599 align:start position:0%
over which it has no authority am i
 
01:03:49.599 --> 01:03:50.710 align:start position:0%
over which it has no authority am i
correct

01:03:50.710 --> 01:03:50.720 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:03:52.950 --> 01:03:52.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i would say
 
01:03:55.190 --> 01:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
not necessarily no
 
01:03:58.470 --> 01:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
because in the discussions would be
 
01:04:01.029 --> 01:04:01.039 align:start position:0%
uh and if the school board were to
 
01:04:03.109 --> 01:04:03.119 align:start position:0%
accept the plan
 
01:04:05.510 --> 01:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
there would be further discussion as to
 
01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
how the question will be phrased how it
 
01:04:09.750 --> 01:04:09.760 align:start position:0%
will appear in the voter guide who the
 
01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
bondholder will be and the like
 
01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:13.270 align:start position:0%
bondholder will be and the like
so

01:04:13.270 --> 01:04:13.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:14.150 align:start position:0%
so
in

01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:04:16.549 --> 01:04:16.559 align:start position:0%
some to answer your question
 
01:04:20.150 --> 01:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
no not necessarily follow-up yes
 
01:04:22.390 --> 01:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
but i don't understand how
 
01:04:24.630 --> 01:04:24.640 align:start position:0%
that financing information has any
 
01:04:26.870 --> 01:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
relationship to whether the school board
 
01:04:28.789 --> 01:04:28.799 align:start position:0%
or the school district has any control
 
01:04:30.789 --> 01:04:30.799 align:start position:0%
over that charter school that charter
 
01:04:33.029 --> 01:04:33.039 align:start position:0%
school is an independent institution so
 
01:04:35.589 --> 01:04:35.599 align:start position:0%
you're asking a community to take on the
 
01:04:37.510 --> 01:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
financial responsibility for an
 
01:04:39.829 --> 01:04:39.839 align:start position:0%
independent institution which is going
 
01:04:41.589 --> 01:04:41.599 align:start position:0%
to be independent in the way it's run
 
01:04:43.349 --> 01:04:43.359 align:start position:0%
who it hires what the principal is what
 
01:04:45.510 --> 01:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
their policies are independent of the
 
01:04:47.990 --> 01:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
school district and the school board yet
 
01:04:50.150 --> 01:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
the the town would despite the fact they
 
01:04:51.430 --> 01:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
don't have control over the way the
 
01:04:53.430 --> 01:04:53.440 align:start position:0%
school is run would then be financially
 
01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:54.710 align:start position:0%
school is run would then be financially
responsible

01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
responsible
 
01:04:56.069 --> 01:04:56.079 align:start position:0%
that's my
 
01:04:58.150 --> 01:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
understanding of this help me if i'm
 
01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:00.069 align:start position:0%
understanding of this help me if i'm
wrong

01:05:00.069 --> 01:05:00.079 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
01:05:02.789 --> 01:05:02.799 align:start position:0%
thank you for that and i can't see
 
01:05:04.870 --> 01:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
where every conversation every
 
01:05:07.349 --> 01:05:07.359 align:start position:0%
discussion that the chartered public
 
01:05:09.589 --> 01:05:09.599 align:start position:0%
school is invited to from the public
 
01:05:12.069 --> 01:05:12.079 align:start position:0%
school board would result in the
 
01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
scenario you painted so i believe that
 
01:05:16.470 --> 01:05:16.480 align:start position:0%
they would continue the chartered school
 
01:05:19.270 --> 01:05:19.280 align:start position:0%
would be able to continue its autonomy
 
01:05:21.750 --> 01:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
but there would be discussions extensive
 
01:05:24.069 --> 01:05:24.079 align:start position:0%
discussions on how this would work but
 
01:05:26.630 --> 01:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
at least the door here is opened i don't
 
01:05:29.990 --> 01:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
see um that scenario you painted
 
01:05:32.150 --> 01:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
coming to light
 
01:05:33.829 --> 01:05:33.839 align:start position:0%
in every conversation between the
 
01:05:37.990 --> 01:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:40.470 --> 01:05:40.480 align:start position:0%
are there for the questions
 
01:05:41.430 --> 01:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
and luna
 
01:05:43.990 --> 01:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much and
 
01:05:45.990 --> 01:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
and i i think you know representative
 
01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:46.950 align:start position:0%
and i i think you know representative
mooney

01:05:46.950 --> 01:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
mooney
 
01:05:48.710 --> 01:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
that that we need to be completely
 
01:05:51.270 --> 01:05:51.280 align:start position:0%
transparent with um with
 
01:05:53.029 --> 01:05:53.039 align:start position:0%
the citizens of new hampshire when it
 
01:05:54.789 --> 01:05:54.799 align:start position:0%
comes to bills like this
 
01:05:56.150 --> 01:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
and that we can't
 
01:05:57.029 --> 01:05:57.039 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
01:06:00.069 --> 01:06:00.079 align:start position:0%
say well not necessarily or really i'm
 
01:06:02.150 --> 01:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
not really sure if it would go that way
 
01:06:04.470 --> 01:06:04.480 align:start position:0%
i think we need to be completely clear
 
01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:05.270 align:start position:0%
i think we need to be completely clear
so

01:06:05.270 --> 01:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:06:07.109 --> 01:06:07.119 align:start position:0%
i'd like you to explain
 
01:06:07.119 --> 01:06:07.990 align:start position:0%
i'd like you to explain
how

01:06:07.990 --> 01:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
how
 
01:06:11.270 --> 01:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
the word shall on line 11 doesn't
 
01:06:13.990 --> 01:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
actually commit the voters
 
01:06:15.910 --> 01:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
in a school district
 
01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:16.950 align:start position:0%
in a school district
to

01:06:16.950 --> 01:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:06:18.710 --> 01:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
to assuming
 
01:06:20.950 --> 01:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
the financial costs associated with a
 
01:06:23.349 --> 01:06:23.359 align:start position:0%
bond for a private
 
01:06:23.359 --> 01:06:24.230 align:start position:0%
bond for a private
um

01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:25.829 align:start position:0%
um
institution

01:06:25.829 --> 01:06:25.839 align:start position:0%
institution
 
01:06:28.470 --> 01:06:28.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question
 
01:06:33.109 --> 01:06:33.119 align:start position:0%
so that shall appears in my number one
 
01:06:34.150 --> 01:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
in my
 
01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:35.750 align:start position:0%
in my
testimony

01:06:35.750 --> 01:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:06:37.589 --> 01:06:37.599 align:start position:0%
shall invite
 
01:06:39.270 --> 01:06:39.280 align:start position:0%
it does not say
 
01:06:42.470 --> 01:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
shall commit to the debt of the charter
 
01:06:45.430 --> 01:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
school shall have their question be
 
01:06:47.029 --> 01:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
included in the school district's
 
01:06:48.710 --> 01:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
question in the upcoming election it
 
01:06:51.910 --> 01:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't say that it says shall invite to
 
01:06:55.670 --> 01:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:00.069 --> 01:07:00.079 align:start position:0%
participate in discussions
 
01:07:00.079 --> 01:07:01.029 align:start position:0%
participate in discussions
then

01:07:01.029 --> 01:07:01.039 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
you go through the rest of the sections
 
01:07:05.270 --> 01:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
here by trying to summarize it and
 
01:07:08.069 --> 01:07:08.079 align:start position:0%
describe it would be then the process of
 
01:07:11.430 --> 01:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
what happens keeping the school board
 
01:07:14.549 --> 01:07:14.559 align:start position:0%
basically in control
 
01:07:16.230 --> 01:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
after those discussions if the school
 
01:07:18.150 --> 01:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
board says no to the construction plan
 
01:07:19.910 --> 01:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
you can't be on our ballot question the
 
01:07:25.349 --> 01:07:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:26.630 --> 01:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
and i agree with your point about
 
01:07:28.870 --> 01:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
transparency absolutely
 
01:07:30.870 --> 01:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
but i also agree that chartered public
 
01:07:33.109 --> 01:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
schools like other public schools have
 
01:07:34.950 --> 01:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
the same needs
 
01:07:36.950 --> 01:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
and that includes
 
01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:37.990 align:start position:0%
and that includes
costs

01:07:37.990 --> 01:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
costs
 
01:07:41.270 --> 01:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
of and updates and so on related to
 
01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:43.190 align:start position:0%
of and updates and so on related to
facilities

01:07:43.190 --> 01:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
01:07:46.309 --> 01:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
so i guess in some
 
01:07:49.190 --> 01:07:49.200 align:start position:0%
i don't see where shell
 
01:07:52.549 --> 01:07:52.559 align:start position:0%
takes on anything other than continuing
 
01:07:55.430 --> 01:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
with the rest of the sentence
 
01:07:57.990 --> 01:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
participate in discussions regarding the
 
01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.349 align:start position:0%
participate in discussions regarding the
possible

01:07:59.349 --> 01:07:59.359 align:start position:0%
possible
 
01:08:00.870 --> 01:08:00.880 align:start position:0%
another emphasis
 
01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:02.069 align:start position:0%
another emphasis
possible

01:08:02.069 --> 01:08:02.079 align:start position:0%
possible
 
01:08:04.710 --> 01:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
submission of such a question
 
01:08:06.710 --> 01:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
there is no commitment
 
01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:08.720 align:start position:0%
in section roman
 
01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:09.589 align:start position:0%

a

01:08:10.950 --> 01:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:08:12.309 --> 01:08:12.319 align:start position:0%
other than
 
01:08:15.109 --> 01:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
hey we're having a discussion on a bond
 
01:08:20.550 --> 01:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:22.229 --> 01:08:22.239 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock
 
01:08:23.669 --> 01:08:23.679 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman uh thank you
 
01:08:25.990 --> 01:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
representing to take my question i enjoy
 
01:08:29.510 --> 01:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
watching you perform um the my question
 
01:08:31.829 --> 01:08:31.839 align:start position:0%
specifically deals with uh the building
 
01:08:33.349 --> 01:08:33.359 align:start position:0%
piece and usually representative ladder
 
01:08:34.390 --> 01:08:34.400 align:start position:0%
luna have
 
01:08:35.749 --> 01:08:35.759 align:start position:0%
not usually always have much better
 
01:08:37.349 --> 01:08:37.359 align:start position:0%
understanding of that than i
 
01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
but in this case if i was a chartered
 
01:08:41.430 --> 01:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
public school
 
01:08:44.709 --> 01:08:44.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:46.950 --> 01:08:46.960 align:start position:0%
and i received students from
 
01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:48.709 align:start position:0%
and i received students from
hitherto

01:08:48.709 --> 01:08:48.719 align:start position:0%
hitherto
 
01:08:50.470 --> 01:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
to the enrollment
 
01:08:51.749 --> 01:08:51.759 align:start position:0%
how would
 
01:08:51.759 --> 01:08:52.470 align:start position:0%
how would
the

01:08:52.470 --> 01:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:08:55.269 --> 01:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
other sending hitherto schools be
 
01:08:57.990 --> 01:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
responsible or pay their share
 
01:09:00.950 --> 01:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
of this uh building process because
 
01:09:03.910 --> 01:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
am i thinking i may be incorrect um but
 
01:09:04.950 --> 01:09:04.960 align:start position:0%
i thought typically they'd be the
 
01:09:07.269 --> 01:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
bonding for that town or school district
 
01:09:09.669 --> 01:09:09.679 align:start position:0%
so how do the other participating uh
 
01:09:11.510 --> 01:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
districts pay their share of their
 
01:09:13.430 --> 01:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
bonding under this scenario
 
01:09:15.030 --> 01:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
yeah it's a good question and the answer
 
01:09:16.789 --> 01:09:16.799 align:start position:0%
is um they don't
 
01:09:19.910 --> 01:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
it is on the the uh the town or the city
 
01:09:23.349 --> 01:09:23.359 align:start position:0%
where the school district is located
 
01:09:26.309 --> 01:09:26.319 align:start position:0%
so unless uh future legislation would
 
01:09:28.789 --> 01:09:28.799 align:start position:0%
have a you know money follows the child
 
01:09:30.550 --> 01:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
sort of scenario the answer to your
 
01:09:33.189 --> 01:09:33.199 align:start position:0%
question is uh they don't as far as i
 
01:09:36.550 --> 01:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
thank you so
 
01:09:39.510 --> 01:09:39.520 align:start position:0%
so i'm privately clearing this i'm
 
01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:40.789 align:start position:0%
so i'm privately clearing this i'm
coming

01:09:40.789 --> 01:09:40.799 align:start position:0%
coming
 
01:09:43.669 --> 01:09:43.679 align:start position:0%
my town is going to pay with no chance
 
01:09:45.829 --> 01:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
for reimbursement under this bill
 
01:09:48.309 --> 01:09:48.319 align:start position:0%
for students from other sending towns
 
01:09:50.149 --> 01:09:50.159 align:start position:0%
they're paying no cost for that unlike a
 
01:09:52.789 --> 01:09:52.799 align:start position:0%
cooperative school or a regional school
 
01:09:55.110 --> 01:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
they're just coming in and they're free
 
01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:56.630 align:start position:0%
they're just coming in and they're free
basically

01:09:56.630 --> 01:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
basically
 
01:09:58.550 --> 01:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
to the top
 
01:10:00.070 --> 01:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
yes however
 
01:10:02.550 --> 01:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
in your question you mentioned um and
 
01:10:04.470 --> 01:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for the follow-up you
 
01:10:06.070 --> 01:10:06.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned um
 
01:10:07.669 --> 01:10:07.679 align:start position:0%
a scenario that taking on the
 
01:10:09.669 --> 01:10:09.679 align:start position:0%
indebtedness that doesn't necessarily
 
01:10:11.430 --> 01:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
based on the discussions that could be
 
01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:12.390 align:start position:0%
based on the discussions that could be
had

01:10:12.390 --> 01:10:12.400 align:start position:0%
had
 
01:10:14.630 --> 01:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
between the charter school and this in
 
01:10:16.790 --> 01:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
the school district you know they might
 
01:10:19.750 --> 01:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
be able to figure something out beyond
 
01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:20.790 align:start position:0%
be able to figure something out beyond
um

01:10:20.790 --> 01:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:22.310 --> 01:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
you know say you're a charter school in
 
01:10:23.669 --> 01:10:23.679 align:start position:0%
manchester and you're dealing with
 
01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
manchester school board manchester
 
01:10:27.110 --> 01:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
united take on all of our construction
 
01:10:34.870 --> 01:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:36.709 --> 01:10:36.719 align:start position:0%
and thank you for being here
 
01:10:38.950 --> 01:10:38.960 align:start position:0%
so my question has to do with if you can
 
01:10:43.030 --> 01:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
cast your mind back to last year 2021
 
01:10:46.950 --> 01:10:46.960 align:start position:0%
we passed hb 278 i think it was
 
01:10:49.350 --> 01:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
and that passed this committee passed
 
01:10:51.669 --> 01:10:51.679 align:start position:0%
the house passed senate governor signed
 
01:10:53.510 --> 01:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
it into law and that was the bill that
 
01:10:56.790 --> 01:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
gave charters uh first dibs if that's
 
01:11:00.630 --> 01:11:00.640 align:start position:0%
the right way to put it on unused or un
 
01:11:01.990 --> 01:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
or available
 
01:11:05.189 --> 01:11:05.199 align:start position:0%
vacant whatever public school properties
 
01:11:06.470 --> 01:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
so my question
 
01:11:07.590 --> 01:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
if that bill which is now
 
01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:11.350 align:start position:0%
if that bill which is now
codified

01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
codified
 
01:11:13.830 --> 01:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
already a special relationship between
 
01:11:15.669 --> 01:11:15.679 align:start position:0%
districts and charters
 
01:11:18.550 --> 01:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
is does that bill have a relationship to
 
01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:19.669 align:start position:0%
is does that bill have a relationship to
what

01:11:19.669 --> 01:11:19.679 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:11:21.750 --> 01:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
you're trying to move forward here thank
 
01:11:23.510 --> 01:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
you for the question i do recall the
 
01:11:25.750 --> 01:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
bill i gave the parliamentary inquiry on
 
01:11:28.310 --> 01:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
the bill and it won by five votes
 
01:11:31.110 --> 01:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
through the house it is certainly
 
01:11:32.229 --> 01:11:32.239 align:start position:0%
a help
 
01:11:34.870 --> 01:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
it is certainly a plus
 
01:11:37.990 --> 01:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
but this bill would open that door even
 
01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:39.189 align:start position:0%
but this bill would open that door even
wider

01:11:39.189 --> 01:11:39.199 align:start position:0%
wider
 
01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
in fact in consultation with those who
 
01:11:43.669 --> 01:11:43.679 align:start position:0%
will testify after me that bill has come
 
01:11:45.910 --> 01:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
up several times and it's in agreement
 
01:11:48.229 --> 01:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
that everyone is is very much
 
01:11:49.910 --> 01:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
in favor of that bill and looking
 
01:11:52.709 --> 01:11:52.719 align:start position:0%
forward to it and it does open lines but
 
01:11:54.709 --> 01:11:54.719 align:start position:0%
this would open lines further in terms
 
01:11:54.719 --> 01:11:55.910 align:start position:0%
this would open lines further in terms
of

01:11:55.910 --> 01:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:11:57.750 --> 01:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
construction costs
 
01:11:57.760 --> 01:11:58.470 align:start position:0%
construction costs
and

01:11:58.470 --> 01:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:12:01.189 --> 01:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
building needs
 
01:12:03.270 --> 01:12:03.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:04.310 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
ford

01:12:04.310 --> 01:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
ford
 
01:12:06.630 --> 01:12:06.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh and thank you
 
01:12:08.229 --> 01:12:08.239 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
01:12:10.470 --> 01:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
sorry i put myself in there
 
01:12:12.550 --> 01:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
way down the list behind representatives
 
01:12:14.630 --> 01:12:14.640 align:start position:0%
lad luno and woodcock in terms of
 
01:12:16.790 --> 01:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
understanding of how this is this works
 
01:12:19.990 --> 01:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
but uh a question i have will be on page
 
01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:20.950 align:start position:0%
but uh a question i have will be on page
three

01:12:20.950 --> 01:12:20.960 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:12:24.229 --> 01:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
uh lines 15 through 21
 
01:12:25.910 --> 01:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
which deal with
 
01:12:27.830 --> 01:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
a charter school public charter school
 
01:12:30.229 --> 01:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
becoming insolvent and then it talks
 
01:12:31.830 --> 01:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
about that the charter school shall
 
01:12:33.510 --> 01:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
repay to
 
01:12:35.110 --> 01:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
to the district at a rate of five
 
01:12:38.070 --> 01:12:38.080 align:start position:0%
percent if a school is insolvent and in
 
01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:39.350 align:start position:0%
percent if a school is insolvent and in
fact

01:12:39.350 --> 01:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
fact
 
01:12:41.830 --> 01:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't have resources how are they
 
01:12:43.590 --> 01:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
going to repay the bond to the school
 
01:12:44.709 --> 01:12:44.719 align:start position:0%
district if they don't have the
 
01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:49.750 --> 01:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
you know that's a good question and i'm
 
01:12:51.910 --> 01:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
glad you brought up that section because
 
01:12:54.790 --> 01:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
i didn't mention it in my testimony
 
01:12:57.189 --> 01:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
but it's an important section and that's
 
01:12:59.910 --> 01:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
the the wrap up if in fact there's a
 
01:13:02.830 --> 01:13:02.840 align:start position:0%
school that is in the situation you
 
01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:04.470 align:start position:0%
school that is in the situation you
described

01:13:04.470 --> 01:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
described
 
01:13:07.669 --> 01:13:07.679 align:start position:0%
i would refer you to line 14
 
01:13:10.149 --> 01:13:10.159 align:start position:0%
where it mentions that if in fact the
 
01:13:14.149 --> 01:13:14.159 align:start position:0%
chartered school goes forward
 
01:13:16.550 --> 01:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
with a bond question and the like they
 
01:13:19.590 --> 01:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
will enter into a contract
 
01:13:21.990 --> 01:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
with the school district where the
 
01:13:24.149 --> 01:13:24.159 align:start position:0%
charter school is located
 
01:13:26.149 --> 01:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
that would spell out
 
01:13:28.310 --> 01:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
exactly scenarios and terms as you
 
01:13:30.790 --> 01:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
described as for the specifics of that i
 
01:13:32.950 --> 01:13:32.960 align:start position:0%
cannot get into that i don't know the
 
01:13:35.110 --> 01:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
answer but i would imagine that in that
 
01:13:37.030 --> 01:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
section entering into a contract like
 
01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:37.910 align:start position:0%
section entering into a contract like
that

01:13:37.910 --> 01:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:13:40.070 --> 01:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
various chartered schools various school
 
01:13:42.470 --> 01:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
boards a scenario like that would be
 
01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:43.669 align:start position:0%
boards a scenario like that would be
included

01:13:43.669 --> 01:13:43.679 align:start position:0%
included
 
01:13:46.390 --> 01:13:46.400 align:start position:0%
and accounted for
 
01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:47.510 align:start position:0%
and accounted for
follow-up

01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:48.470 align:start position:0%
follow-up
yes

01:13:48.470 --> 01:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:49.990 align:start position:0%
yes
uh

01:13:49.990 --> 01:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:13:52.470 --> 01:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
given that scenario then i would assume
 
01:13:54.310 --> 01:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
there would be in that agreement
 
01:13:55.830 --> 01:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
there would be some answer to the
 
01:13:58.070 --> 01:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
question that i asked which is
 
01:14:00.229 --> 01:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
the charter entire school's insolvent
 
01:14:02.149 --> 01:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
does not have resources and therefore
 
01:14:03.910 --> 01:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
we're not going to repay the school and
 
01:14:05.510 --> 01:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
everybody's going to agree to that i
 
01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:06.310 align:start position:0%
everybody's going to agree to that i
would

01:14:06.310 --> 01:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:14:07.830 --> 01:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
is that your question yes i agree with
 
01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:08.870 align:start position:0%
is that your question yes i agree with
that

01:14:08.870 --> 01:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:14:11.510 --> 01:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
thank you yes i do i think exactly what
 
01:14:13.189 --> 01:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
that contract will do representative
 
01:14:13.199 --> 01:14:15.910 align:start position:0%
that contract will do representative
ford

01:14:15.910 --> 01:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:17.669 --> 01:14:17.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:14:19.189 --> 01:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
and thank you for entertaining my
 
01:14:19.199 --> 01:14:20.870 align:start position:0%
and thank you for entertaining my
question

01:14:20.870 --> 01:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:14:22.950 --> 01:14:22.960 align:start position:0%
i asked a question in a similar
 
01:14:25.270 --> 01:14:25.280 align:start position:0%
discussion some time ago about who owns
 
01:14:26.870 --> 01:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
the property
 
01:14:28.709 --> 01:14:28.719 align:start position:0%
i think i should have rephrased it at
 
01:14:31.510 --> 01:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
that time and i'm asking you
 
01:14:33.430 --> 01:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't this be clarified if this
 
01:14:34.950 --> 01:14:34.960 align:start position:0%
stated that
 
01:14:37.510 --> 01:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
whoever provides the funding shall hold
 
01:14:39.590 --> 01:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
a lien on the property
 
01:14:41.110 --> 01:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
from the get-go
 
01:14:43.270 --> 01:14:43.280 align:start position:0%
and so you don't pay it back we own the
 
01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:44.390 align:start position:0%
and so you don't pay it back we own the
property

01:14:44.390 --> 01:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
property
 
01:14:45.990 --> 01:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
and that's the person who paid out the
 
01:14:47.830 --> 01:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
money and that in this case it would be
 
01:14:50.709 --> 01:14:50.719 align:start position:0%
the school board or the town or whatever
 
01:14:51.669 --> 01:14:51.679 align:start position:0%
but that
 
01:14:54.310 --> 01:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that simplify this process
 
01:14:55.590 --> 01:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i remember
 
01:14:57.189 --> 01:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
the question from last week i would
 
01:14:58.709 --> 01:14:58.719 align:start position:0%
agree with that yes i think that would
 
01:15:00.630 --> 01:15:00.640 align:start position:0%
be a friendly amendment
 
01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:15:04.470 --> 01:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
in addition any sort of um clarification
 
01:15:07.110 --> 01:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
as to ownership and the like which what
 
01:15:08.870 --> 01:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
you're proposing would do
 
01:15:14.870 --> 01:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:17.910 --> 01:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of questions on this
 
01:15:20.630 --> 01:15:20.640 align:start position:0%
i understand and i would you know to
 
01:15:21.910 --> 01:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
remind the committee that there are
 
01:15:25.350 --> 01:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
those speaking after me um
 
01:15:27.669 --> 01:15:27.679 align:start position:0%
and perhaps if there are questions
 
01:15:29.510 --> 01:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
that they can't answer or
 
01:15:30.950 --> 01:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
better directed to me i'd be happy to
 
01:15:32.470 --> 01:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
come at the end again
 
01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:33.350 align:start position:0%
come at the end again
but

01:15:33.350 --> 01:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:15:35.430 --> 01:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
i understand the specifics of this and i
 
01:15:37.510 --> 01:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
would ask that others behind me also
 
01:15:39.270 --> 01:15:39.280 align:start position:0%
have things to contribute your question
 
01:15:40.790 --> 01:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
to the person testifying right now
 
01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:43.669 align:start position:0%
to the person testifying right now
represent

01:15:43.669 --> 01:15:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:45.669 --> 01:15:45.679 align:start position:0%
yes you're talking about if school
 
01:15:45.679 --> 01:15:47.669 align:start position:0%
yes you're talking about if school
boards

01:15:47.669 --> 01:15:47.679 align:start position:0%
boards
 
01:15:49.270 --> 01:15:49.280 align:start position:0%
have a bond
 
01:15:51.910 --> 01:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
are already thinking of a bond issue and
 
01:15:54.709 --> 01:15:54.719 align:start position:0%
my question is can the charter school
 
01:15:54.719 --> 01:15:55.910 align:start position:0%
my question is can the charter school
come

01:15:55.910 --> 01:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
come
 
01:15:57.430 --> 01:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
if the school
 
01:16:00.070 --> 01:16:00.080 align:start position:0%
board doesn't have a bond issue on their
 
01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:01.910 align:start position:0%
board doesn't have a bond issue on their
regular

01:16:01.910 --> 01:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
regular
 
01:16:04.149 --> 01:16:04.159 align:start position:0%
you know where they're doing contracts
 
01:16:06.149 --> 01:16:06.159 align:start position:0%
and all of that
 
01:16:09.270 --> 01:16:09.280 align:start position:0%
can the charter school still ask
 
01:16:12.470 --> 01:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
if there can be a bond put on
 
01:16:14.390 --> 01:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for that and that's very
 
01:16:16.229 --> 01:16:16.239 align:start position:0%
important and that was related to my
 
01:16:19.350 --> 01:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
concluding remarks it's unclear
 
01:16:21.510 --> 01:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
i would say the law is unclear on that
 
01:16:22.950 --> 01:16:22.960 align:start position:0%
very point
 
01:16:25.669 --> 01:16:25.679 align:start position:0%
i don't know the scenario playing out if
 
01:16:27.669 --> 01:16:27.679 align:start position:0%
a chartered school were to approach the
 
01:16:30.470 --> 01:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
school board and ask how the school
 
01:16:32.709 --> 01:16:32.719 align:start position:0%
board would receive that
 
01:16:35.510 --> 01:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
but this bill would hopefully
 
01:16:37.430 --> 01:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
um clarify that or an amendment that
 
01:16:39.830 --> 01:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
would even say that would be very
 
01:16:42.149 --> 01:16:42.159 align:start position:0%
beneficial because right now
 
01:16:44.149 --> 01:16:44.159 align:start position:0%
it is unclear and that's the best i can
 
01:16:45.910 --> 01:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
answer that question thank you for that
 
01:16:50.229 --> 01:16:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:51.750 --> 01:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much for your
 
01:16:54.709 --> 01:16:54.719 align:start position:0%
presentation we'll go on to the next
 
01:16:56.550 --> 01:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
speaker right now
 
01:17:21.590 --> 01:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:31.270 --> 01:17:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:33.030 --> 01:17:33.040 align:start position:0%
i'm bill phillips um with the national
 
01:17:35.110 --> 01:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
alliance for public charter schools uh
 
01:17:37.990 --> 01:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
thank you once again for having me
 
01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:39.030 align:start position:0%
thank you once again for having me
um

01:17:39.030 --> 01:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:40.630 --> 01:17:40.640 align:start position:0%
you know i was actually doing just fine
 
01:17:41.830 --> 01:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
with the way you were going there pepper
 
01:17:42.870 --> 01:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
and her with those questions i was
 
01:17:45.030 --> 01:17:45.040 align:start position:0%
writing them down frantically but uh
 
01:17:46.390 --> 01:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
and i can answer there's a couple there
 
01:17:48.630 --> 01:17:48.640 align:start position:0%
that i'll actually i can help answer but
 
01:17:51.590 --> 01:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
um from a testimony standpoint
 
01:17:53.910 --> 01:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
let me um
 
01:17:55.430 --> 01:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
you have you have my testimony so let me
 
01:17:57.910 --> 01:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
just speak broadly to a little bit of it
 
01:18:00.790 --> 01:18:00.800 align:start position:0%
the rationale for the bill is twofold
 
01:18:02.550 --> 01:18:02.560 align:start position:0%
and i talked a little bit about this
 
01:18:03.990 --> 01:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
last week
 
01:18:05.830 --> 01:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
in that
 
01:18:07.590 --> 01:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
you have a situation in new hampshire
 
01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:08.390 align:start position:0%
you have a situation in new hampshire
now

01:18:08.390 --> 01:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:18:09.990 --> 01:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
where your charter schools for the most
 
01:18:12.709 --> 01:18:12.719 align:start position:0%
part are using their they're using
 
01:18:14.709 --> 01:18:14.719 align:start position:0%
uh funds that should go for programming
 
01:18:16.310 --> 01:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
for their facilities
 
01:18:20.310 --> 01:18:20.320 align:start position:0%
and i actually for what it's worth um
 
01:18:22.550 --> 01:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
in the two pages the back page i gave
 
01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:23.669 align:start position:0%
in the two pages the back page i gave
you

01:18:23.669 --> 01:18:23.679 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:18:25.189 --> 01:18:25.199 align:start position:0%
forgive the presentation on it but on
 
01:18:26.870 --> 01:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
the right side of it there was a survey
 
01:18:28.870 --> 01:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
done in 2018
 
01:18:30.709 --> 01:18:30.719 align:start position:0%
that surveyed the charter schools and it
 
01:18:33.270 --> 01:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
identified a number of ways of which
 
01:18:34.630 --> 01:18:34.640 align:start position:0%
they were they were having programming
 
01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:35.510 align:start position:0%
they were they were having programming
issues

01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
issues
 
01:18:38.229 --> 01:18:38.239 align:start position:0%
due to funding issues
 
01:18:40.709 --> 01:18:40.719 align:start position:0%
so my point is that
 
01:18:43.510 --> 01:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
once they're up and growing
 
01:18:45.990 --> 01:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh there there's a need for help with
 
01:18:47.430 --> 01:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
their facilities so that they can
 
01:18:48.709 --> 01:18:48.719 align:start position:0%
actually implement their programming and
 
01:18:50.070 --> 01:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
not have to use their operating funds
 
01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:51.270 align:start position:0%
not have to use their operating funds
for

01:18:51.270 --> 01:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:18:52.790 --> 01:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
uh for facilities
 
01:18:53.830 --> 01:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
you know the programming funds for
 
01:18:55.990 --> 01:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
facilities if you will
 
01:18:57.830 --> 01:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
the other reason for this which was
 
01:18:59.510 --> 01:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
which was not stated but which we have
 
01:19:02.229 --> 01:19:02.239 align:start position:0%
seen in a couple other states
 
01:19:03.990 --> 01:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
i don't think i have to tell you that
 
01:19:06.149 --> 01:19:06.159 align:start position:0%
school bonds are hard to pass
 
01:19:06.159 --> 01:19:08.870 align:start position:0%
school bonds are hard to pass
um

01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:11.030 --> 01:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
including the charter interests in the
 
01:19:13.030 --> 01:19:13.040 align:start position:0%
bonding process i think actually may
 
01:19:14.790 --> 01:19:14.800 align:start position:0%
make it easier to pass the bond at some
 
01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:16.070 align:start position:0%
make it easier to pass the bond at some
point

01:19:16.070 --> 01:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:17.590 align:start position:0%
point
um

01:19:17.590 --> 01:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:18.630 --> 01:19:18.640 align:start position:0%
i mean that's actually what you what
 
01:19:20.470 --> 01:19:20.480 align:start position:0%
you'll see in other places i mean look i
 
01:19:21.750 --> 01:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
live in a place where i don't remember a
 
01:19:23.510 --> 01:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
bond ever passing by more than three
 
01:19:26.470 --> 01:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
four five five percent and
 
01:19:27.590 --> 01:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
you're going to get to some places where
 
01:19:28.630 --> 01:19:28.640 align:start position:0%
you're you know the charter community is
 
01:19:30.229 --> 01:19:30.239 align:start position:0%
going to be three four five percent i
 
01:19:31.669 --> 01:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
think you might want them
 
01:19:33.669 --> 01:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
energized and involved in your bonding
 
01:19:36.390 --> 01:19:36.400 align:start position:0%
process and so this actually
 
01:19:38.950 --> 01:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
one of the things that um representative
 
01:19:41.350 --> 01:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
mooney mentioned
 
01:19:42.390 --> 01:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
we actually
 
01:19:44.310 --> 01:19:44.320 align:start position:0%
checked a missile fight the municipal
 
01:19:46.870 --> 01:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
finance act it is not it is not clear on
 
01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:47.669 align:start position:0%
finance act it is not it is not clear on
this

01:19:47.669 --> 01:19:47.679 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:19:50.149 --> 01:19:50.159 align:start position:0%
um it is not clear that the charters and
 
01:19:51.270 --> 01:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
the districts can work together on
 
01:19:53.110 --> 01:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
bonding it is not at all clear that they
 
01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:53.830 align:start position:0%
bonding it is not at all clear that they
can

01:19:53.830 --> 01:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:19:55.830 --> 01:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
do their own their own bonding
 
01:19:57.830 --> 01:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
um if i may answer your question the way
 
01:19:59.510 --> 01:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
the law is currently written
 
01:20:02.550 --> 01:20:02.560 align:start position:0%
i i don't think the charter could
 
01:20:04.790 --> 01:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
so the law right now is not clear at all
 
01:20:07.350 --> 01:20:07.360 align:start position:0%
if we pass this bill i don't think it's
 
01:20:08.629 --> 01:20:08.639 align:start position:0%
clear that the charter could do it on
 
01:20:10.390 --> 01:20:10.400 align:start position:0%
its own as well and honestly i'm not
 
01:20:12.709 --> 01:20:12.719 align:start position:0%
sure how they would actually pass a
 
01:20:14.550 --> 01:20:14.560 align:start position:0%
pass a bond you know it's they're still
 
01:20:16.950 --> 01:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
a pretty small part of the population
 
01:20:18.229 --> 01:20:18.239 align:start position:0%
i'm not i wouldn't be against that
 
01:20:19.430 --> 01:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
amendment but
 
01:20:20.709 --> 01:20:20.719 align:start position:0%
i think the reason this would work is
 
01:20:21.830 --> 01:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
when you start to get the district
 
01:20:23.030 --> 01:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
interest in the charter interest on the
 
01:20:24.629 --> 01:20:24.639 align:start position:0%
same page
 
01:20:24.639 --> 01:20:25.350 align:start position:0%
same page
so

01:20:25.350 --> 01:20:25.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:26.870 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:20:26.870 --> 01:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:29.430 --> 01:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
okay so i want to in very
 
01:20:31.430 --> 01:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
broad terms explain what we're trying to
 
01:20:32.950 --> 01:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
do here
 
01:20:34.950 --> 01:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
the district's considering bonding
 
01:20:37.189 --> 01:20:37.199 align:start position:0%
they're obligated to to
 
01:20:39.990 --> 01:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
notify the charter of its intentions
 
01:20:41.669 --> 01:20:41.679 align:start position:0%
the charter has the right to request
 
01:20:44.229 --> 01:20:44.239 align:start position:0%
participation in the bonding effort
 
01:20:46.790 --> 01:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
the district has the right to say no
 
01:20:48.950 --> 01:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
okay very very clear this is voluntary
 
01:20:52.550 --> 01:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:53.990 --> 01:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
i will answer there were a number of
 
01:20:55.270 --> 01:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
questions that were asked that were
 
01:20:57.910 --> 01:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
related to why would this make sense i
 
01:20:59.030 --> 01:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
think you shouldn't lose sight of the
 
01:21:00.470 --> 01:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
fact that remember the taxpayers
 
01:21:02.310 --> 01:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
actually get to say no
 
01:21:05.350 --> 01:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
so so for instance if um
 
01:21:06.629 --> 01:21:06.639 align:start position:0%
representative ellison you asked a bunch
 
01:21:07.830 --> 01:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
of questions as to like why would they
 
01:21:09.350 --> 01:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
do this if they don't give a good answer
 
01:21:10.070 --> 01:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
you know what they're going to lose the
 
01:21:12.470 --> 01:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
bond fight don't forget the taxpayer
 
01:21:15.270 --> 01:21:15.280 align:start position:0%
gets to say no even if the district says
 
01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:16.550 align:start position:0%
gets to say no even if the district says
yes

01:21:16.550 --> 01:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:17.510 align:start position:0%
yes
um

01:21:17.510 --> 01:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:18.629 --> 01:21:18.639 align:start position:0%
last point here and then i'm actually
 
01:21:20.149 --> 01:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
just if you'll let me i'll run through
 
01:21:22.070 --> 01:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
some of the questions that were asked
 
01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:24.310 align:start position:0%
some of the questions that were asked
earlier

01:21:24.310 --> 01:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
01:21:28.390 --> 01:21:28.400 align:start position:0%
i want to flag for you um
 
01:21:29.910 --> 01:21:29.920 align:start position:0%
in the past month
 
01:21:31.830 --> 01:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
representative mooney we and i we've
 
01:21:33.510 --> 01:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
we've presented three different kind
 
01:21:35.030 --> 01:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
three different kinds of facilities
 
01:21:37.270 --> 01:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
bills we did a revolving fund we did
 
01:21:38.550 --> 01:21:38.560 align:start position:0%
building aid last week and then we've
 
01:21:40.310 --> 01:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
got this bonding bill
 
01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:42.870 align:start position:0%
got this bonding bill
here

01:21:42.870 --> 01:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:21:45.030 --> 01:21:45.040 align:start position:0%
context behind that is
 
01:21:48.709 --> 01:21:48.719 align:start position:0%
you have a state i realize this is not
 
01:21:50.310 --> 01:21:50.320 align:start position:0%
100 of the state feeling that way but
 
01:21:52.629 --> 01:21:52.639 align:start position:0%
you have a state now that is interested
 
01:21:54.830 --> 01:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
in growing the charter
 
01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:56.470 align:start position:0%
in growing the charter
space

01:21:56.470 --> 01:21:56.480 align:start position:0%
space
 
01:21:58.149 --> 01:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
the things that get in the way of that
 
01:22:00.709 --> 01:22:00.719 align:start position:0%
are lack of startup funds facilities
 
01:22:03.430 --> 01:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
problems and access to talent
 
01:22:05.030 --> 01:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
you dealt with a startup issue when you
 
01:22:07.189 --> 01:22:07.199 align:start position:0%
accepted the federal csp grant which i
 
01:22:08.550 --> 01:22:08.560 align:start position:0%
realized was a little bit dramatic for a
 
01:22:10.870 --> 01:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
while but you dealt with it
 
01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:11.910 align:start position:0%
while but you dealt with it
um

01:22:11.910 --> 01:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:14.149 --> 01:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
this is about dealing with the the
 
01:22:17.750 --> 01:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:19.350 --> 01:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
the other piece if you looked at that
 
01:22:21.830 --> 01:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
second page
 
01:22:24.709 --> 01:22:24.719 align:start position:0%
i had flagged for you that there's a
 
01:22:27.270 --> 01:22:27.280 align:start position:0%
fairly decent sized gap between
 
01:22:29.669 --> 01:22:29.679 align:start position:0%
district and charter funding
 
01:22:31.110 --> 01:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
let me tell you what i'm not saying with
 
01:22:32.870 --> 01:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
that is i'm not saying oh you got to
 
01:22:34.310 --> 01:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
even that up or you don't care about
 
01:22:36.550 --> 01:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
kids i am not saying that i don't know
 
01:22:38.629 --> 01:22:38.639 align:start position:0%
what the right number is frankly
 
01:22:40.470 --> 01:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
what i'm actually telling you
 
01:22:42.390 --> 01:22:42.400 align:start position:0%
is when i look at a lot of states and
 
01:22:43.990 --> 01:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
when i see
 
01:22:45.750 --> 01:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
that kind of a gap it doesn't surprise
 
01:22:47.110 --> 01:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
me that the charters are just having a
 
01:22:48.310 --> 01:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
hard time
 
01:22:50.149 --> 01:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
getting their buildings paid for so what
 
01:22:51.910 --> 01:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do is just give you some
 
01:22:53.669 --> 01:22:53.679 align:start position:0%
solutions to actually help fix that
 
01:22:53.679 --> 01:22:56.070 align:start position:0%
solutions to actually help fix that
problem

01:22:56.070 --> 01:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:58.629 --> 01:22:58.639 align:start position:0%
the lease aid work you did last year the
 
01:23:02.149 --> 01:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
the uh the disposition the local the 278
 
01:23:03.430 --> 01:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
representative bill you were talking
 
01:23:04.790 --> 01:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
about for that
 
01:23:07.350 --> 01:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
those are all great steps they all help
 
01:23:09.189 --> 01:23:09.199 align:start position:0%
solve the problem this just helps it a
 
01:23:10.870 --> 01:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
bit more and that's the context that i
 
01:23:13.110 --> 01:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
would hope you'd consider this with
 
01:23:15.510 --> 01:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
um mr chairman do you before i take
 
01:23:16.629 --> 01:23:16.639 align:start position:0%
questions do you mind if i answer a
 
01:23:17.910 --> 01:23:17.920 align:start position:0%
couple of the questions that were asked
 
01:23:21.189 --> 01:23:21.199 align:start position:0%
or i'll i can do either way well um we
 
01:23:23.590 --> 01:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
are on a tight rope here uh we did get
 
01:23:25.910 --> 01:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
some responses from the representative
 
01:23:27.990 --> 01:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
who presented the bill
 
01:23:30.310 --> 01:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
uh if you can go over that in a minute
 
01:23:32.709 --> 01:23:32.719 align:start position:0%
or two that'd be fine but i don't want
 
01:23:35.189 --> 01:23:35.199 align:start position:0%
to get into a lengthy discussion on that
 
01:23:38.229 --> 01:23:38.239 align:start position:0%
at this point in time yep okay um how
 
01:23:40.709 --> 01:23:40.719 align:start position:0%
about this there was one piece that i
 
01:23:42.790 --> 01:23:42.800 align:start position:0%
that i would want to clarify
 
01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:44.070 align:start position:0%
that i would want to clarify
um

01:23:44.070 --> 01:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:45.750 --> 01:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
there was uh representative ford you
 
01:23:46.870 --> 01:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
asked the question about who owns the
 
01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:49.189 align:start position:0%
asked the question about who owns the
building

01:23:49.189 --> 01:23:49.199 align:start position:0%
building
 
01:23:50.870 --> 01:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
you could do it by an amendment or the
 
01:23:52.470 --> 01:23:52.480 align:start position:0%
other thing you could do
 
01:23:52.480 --> 01:23:53.910 align:start position:0%
other thing you could do
charters

01:23:53.910 --> 01:23:53.920 align:start position:0%
charters
 
01:23:55.669 --> 01:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
typically enter into what are known as
 
01:23:58.550 --> 01:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
dissolution agreements with the state
 
01:23:59.990 --> 01:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
so you could actually write that into
 
01:24:02.709 --> 01:24:02.719 align:start position:0%
the disillusion dissolution statement
 
01:24:02.719 --> 01:24:03.910 align:start position:0%
the disillusion dissolution statement
where

01:24:03.910 --> 01:24:03.920 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:24:05.910 --> 01:24:05.920 align:start position:0%
the way it could be
 
01:24:08.149 --> 01:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
the town owns the building or it could
 
01:24:08.159 --> 01:24:09.430 align:start position:0%
the town owns the building or it could
be

01:24:09.430 --> 01:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:24:11.350 --> 01:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
in the case of dissolution the charter
 
01:24:13.750 --> 01:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
is obligated to sell the building
 
01:24:17.270 --> 01:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
and pay off the bond holders and the
 
01:24:19.669 --> 01:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
taxpayers you you can do it either way
 
01:24:20.870 --> 01:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
the dissolution agreement just might
 
01:24:21.590 --> 01:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
give you
 
01:24:22.950 --> 01:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
maybe what you want to make sure you
 
01:24:24.070 --> 01:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
have an amendment on is making sure
 
01:24:25.990 --> 01:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
there is a dissolution agreement that
 
01:24:27.270 --> 01:24:27.280 align:start position:0%
way would be the most flexible way that
 
01:24:28.790 --> 01:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
they could actually write it to
 
01:24:31.350 --> 01:24:31.360 align:start position:0%
fit local circumstances
 
01:24:32.870 --> 01:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:24:34.550 --> 01:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
are there are there questions from the
 
01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:36.629 align:start position:0%
are there are there questions from the
committee

01:24:36.629 --> 01:24:36.639 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:24:38.709 --> 01:24:38.719 align:start position:0%
nassim thank you very much
 
01:24:40.390 --> 01:24:40.400 align:start position:0%
pleasure thank you again for having me
 
01:24:50.950 --> 01:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:52.629 --> 01:24:52.639 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman and committee
 
01:24:55.189 --> 01:24:55.199 align:start position:0%
members my name is kim lavalley i reside
 
01:24:57.830 --> 01:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
in mount vernon and i'm here in support
 
01:25:01.110 --> 01:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
of hb 1402
 
01:25:03.110 --> 01:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
i recognize your time is tight so i'll
 
01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:03.910 align:start position:0%
i recognize your time is tight so i'll
just

01:25:03.910 --> 01:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:25:05.830 --> 01:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
go over some of the highlights i think
 
01:25:07.590 --> 01:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
clearing up the law in this matter would
 
01:25:09.590 --> 01:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
be a great step forward as
 
01:25:11.669 --> 01:25:11.679 align:start position:0%
representative mooney has said
 
01:25:14.790 --> 01:25:14.800 align:start position:0%
encouraging collaboration between
 
01:25:17.030 --> 01:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
districts and charter schools
 
01:25:18.550 --> 01:25:18.560 align:start position:0%
is another great
 
01:25:20.790 --> 01:25:20.800 align:start position:0%
step forward in opening that door it's
 
01:25:25.590 --> 01:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:27.669 --> 01:25:27.679 align:start position:0%
one of the ways i think it's very rare
 
01:25:30.550 --> 01:25:30.560 align:start position:0%
but one way that this may benefit the
 
01:25:32.790 --> 01:25:32.800 align:start position:0%
districts is if you have a district with
 
01:25:34.950 --> 01:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
a number of charter schools
 
01:25:37.910 --> 01:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
in that district and they're applying
 
01:25:40.470 --> 01:25:40.480 align:start position:0%
for the bond they put it forward
 
01:25:42.470 --> 01:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
they may gain additional support if
 
01:25:44.310 --> 01:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
they're able to accept some of the
 
01:25:46.470 --> 01:25:46.480 align:start position:0%
smaller construction needs that perhaps
 
01:25:48.149 --> 01:25:48.159 align:start position:0%
the charter schools are putting forward
 
01:25:49.110 --> 01:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:25:51.030 --> 01:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
you have a lot of charter school parents
 
01:25:53.350 --> 01:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
in those districts who would be voting
 
01:25:57.990 --> 01:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:59.510 --> 01:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
the point about
 
01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:00.709 align:start position:0%
the point about
funding

01:26:00.709 --> 01:26:00.719 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:26:02.470 --> 01:26:02.480 align:start position:0%
going towards facility instead of
 
01:26:05.030 --> 01:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
programming i can speak to that
 
01:26:06.790 --> 01:26:06.800 align:start position:0%
having worked in a charter school and
 
01:26:08.709 --> 01:26:08.719 align:start position:0%
opened several and working with a number
 
01:26:10.070 --> 01:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
of them out there
 
01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
it's such an issue
 
01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:13.270 align:start position:0%
it's such an issue
73

01:26:13.270 --> 01:26:13.280 align:start position:0%
73
 
01:26:15.910 --> 01:26:15.920 align:start position:0%
38 that's what they're given and trying
 
01:26:19.110 --> 01:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
to find funding for any improvement much
 
01:26:21.030 --> 01:26:21.040 align:start position:0%
less purchasing a building is incredibly
 
01:26:23.669 --> 01:26:23.679 align:start position:0%
hard typically it comes from donations
 
01:26:25.350 --> 01:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
or you have to take it away from
 
01:26:26.950 --> 01:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
something else that's happening in the
 
01:26:30.629 --> 01:26:30.639 align:start position:0%
school which is necessary for the kiddos
 
01:26:33.350 --> 01:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
so that's my testimony thank you so much
 
01:26:34.950 --> 01:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
if you have any questions i'm happy to
 
01:26:36.709 --> 01:26:36.719 align:start position:0%
answer them thank you very much are
 
01:26:39.430 --> 01:26:39.440 align:start position:0%
there questions representative moffatt
 
01:26:41.990 --> 01:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr thank you for being here so
 
01:26:44.070 --> 01:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
uh i'll preface my question with with a
 
01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:44.950 align:start position:0%
uh i'll preface my question with with a
quick

01:26:44.950 --> 01:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
quick
 
01:26:48.870 --> 01:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
description of i'm from grofton and uh
 
01:26:51.590 --> 01:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
grofton had has a
 
01:26:54.470 --> 01:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
catholic hall that had classrooms in it
 
01:26:57.030 --> 01:26:57.040 align:start position:0%
and for a period of time the district
 
01:27:00.149 --> 01:27:00.159 align:start position:0%
the the public school district uh used
 
01:27:01.510 --> 01:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
something in some fashion rented the
 
01:27:03.669 --> 01:27:03.679 align:start position:0%
space and the catholic coffin
 
01:27:05.510 --> 01:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
and kindergarten and first graders were
 
01:27:07.590 --> 01:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
educated there in fact dr caroline who
 
01:27:09.990 --> 01:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
often comes here was went to school in
 
01:27:11.510 --> 01:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
that catholic for a while in that
 
01:27:14.070 --> 01:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
catholic building so my question
 
01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:15.270 align:start position:0%
catholic building so my question
is

01:27:15.270 --> 01:27:15.280 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:27:16.830 --> 01:27:16.840 align:start position:0%
with regard to
 
01:27:19.669 --> 01:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
mutual potential mutual use of a
 
01:27:22.629 --> 01:27:22.639 align:start position:0%
potential structure that may be uh built
 
01:27:24.470 --> 01:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
and i know you're in the charter school
 
01:27:25.750 --> 01:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
world so my
 
01:27:27.430 --> 01:27:27.440 align:start position:0%
my question is if this were to move
 
01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:28.870 align:start position:0%
my question is if this were to move
forward

01:27:28.870 --> 01:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:27:30.310 --> 01:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
it would the
 
01:27:32.870 --> 01:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
do we need to look at this as mutually
 
01:27:36.070 --> 01:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
exclusive in terms of use of of these
 
01:27:39.830 --> 01:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
school buildings or could both a public
 
01:27:42.390 --> 01:27:42.400 align:start position:0%
district in a charter district use the
 
01:27:43.830 --> 01:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
same space
 
01:27:48.790 --> 01:27:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:51.030 --> 01:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
if i understand your question correctly
 
01:27:52.229 --> 01:27:52.239 align:start position:0%
it would be
 
01:27:54.390 --> 01:27:54.400 align:start position:0%
looking at the
 
01:27:58.070 --> 01:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
space that has been funded by a bond
 
01:27:58.080 --> 01:27:59.510 align:start position:0%
space that has been funded by a bond
from

01:27:59.510 --> 01:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:28:01.750 --> 01:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
one of these schools or from both coming
 
01:28:04.950 --> 01:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
forward to be used for both entities
 
01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:05.990 align:start position:0%
forward to be used for both entities
i

01:28:05.990 --> 01:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:28:07.910 --> 01:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
i don't think that would be a problem
 
01:28:09.270 --> 01:28:09.280 align:start position:0%
but i would really
 
01:28:11.750 --> 01:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
prefer to have mr phillips or
 
01:28:16.310 --> 01:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:17.669 --> 01:28:17.679 align:start position:0%
thank you so
 
01:28:20.629 --> 01:28:20.639 align:start position:0%
to your knowledge you can't cite any
 
01:28:24.070 --> 01:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
existing scenarios or or models that are
 
01:28:27.350 --> 01:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
out there where uh
 
01:28:31.590 --> 01:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
space is shared between public schools
 
01:28:34.070 --> 01:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
and public charter schools you you don't
 
01:28:36.470 --> 01:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
have any examples of that i don't have
 
01:28:38.149 --> 01:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
any off the top of my head where they're
 
01:28:40.470 --> 01:28:40.480 align:start position:0%
sharing the actual building i believe we
 
01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:41.510 align:start position:0%
sharing the actual building i believe we
have

01:28:41.510 --> 01:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:28:43.990 --> 01:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
a few one or two maybe i don't have the
 
01:28:45.990 --> 01:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
exact number of charter schools that may
 
01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:47.030 align:start position:0%
exact number of charter schools that may
be

01:28:47.030 --> 01:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:28:49.189 --> 01:28:49.199 align:start position:0%
in a public school building as a result
 
01:28:52.629 --> 01:28:52.639 align:start position:0%
of hv 278 perhaps renting space
 
01:28:54.390 --> 01:28:54.400 align:start position:0%
but the only
 
01:28:56.550 --> 01:28:56.560 align:start position:0%
case that i can think of would be
 
01:28:57.990 --> 01:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
i think it's a little different it would
 
01:28:59.830 --> 01:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
be a charter school that
 
01:29:04.470 --> 01:29:04.480 align:start position:0%
rents space from a community college
 
01:29:06.149 --> 01:29:06.159 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:29:07.750 --> 01:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
01:29:09.590 --> 01:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you very much thank
 
01:29:12.470 --> 01:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
you very much and our last pink card on
 
01:29:33.270 --> 01:29:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:35.350 --> 01:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and members of the
 
01:29:36.790 --> 01:29:36.800 align:start position:0%
committee for the opportunity to be here
 
01:29:39.110 --> 01:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
my name is bob best i'm from merrimack i
 
01:29:42.070 --> 01:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
support hb 1402
 
01:29:43.830 --> 01:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
i'm an attorney with soloway and hollis
 
01:29:45.350 --> 01:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
and provide legal advice to a number of
 
01:29:48.790 --> 01:29:48.800 align:start position:0%
charter schools and also
 
01:29:50.629 --> 01:29:50.639 align:start position:0%
legal advice or been involved with a
 
01:29:53.110 --> 01:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
number of the bond issues through the
 
01:29:55.430 --> 01:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
state's three bonding authorities
 
01:29:55.440 --> 01:29:56.149 align:start position:0%
state's three bonding authorities
so

01:29:56.149 --> 01:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:29:57.590 --> 01:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
i don't know a lot about municipal
 
01:29:59.030 --> 01:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
bonding i won't talk a lot about that
 
01:30:00.709 --> 01:30:00.719 align:start position:0%
but a little bit about
 
01:30:02.470 --> 01:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
some other types of bonds that are
 
01:30:03.910 --> 01:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
issued where there may be some parallels
 
01:30:05.270 --> 01:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
and some opportunities
 
01:30:07.189 --> 01:30:07.199 align:start position:0%
but first start with the importance to
 
01:30:09.110 --> 01:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
charter schools of this
 
01:30:11.830 --> 01:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
you know new hampshire has
 
01:30:13.830 --> 01:30:13.840 align:start position:0%
you know long had its statute that
 
01:30:15.430 --> 01:30:15.440 align:start position:0%
created charter schools and supports
 
01:30:15.440 --> 01:30:16.229 align:start position:0%
created charter schools and supports
them

01:30:16.229 --> 01:30:16.239 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:30:18.229 --> 01:30:18.239 align:start position:0%
and creates some funding for them for
 
01:30:21.669 --> 01:30:21.679 align:start position:0%
their operations the 7 300 dollars that
 
01:30:23.990 --> 01:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
come per student um you know helps to
 
01:30:25.590 --> 01:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
pay the salaries for the teachers and
 
01:30:27.110 --> 01:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
administrators and books and computers
 
01:30:28.870 --> 01:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
and things um
 
01:30:30.870 --> 01:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
and then there's the
 
01:30:33.030 --> 01:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
federal grants for the startup programs
 
01:30:34.870 --> 01:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
and obviously that helps out a lot but
 
01:30:36.229 --> 01:30:36.239 align:start position:0%
those federal grants don't provide any
 
01:30:37.270 --> 01:30:37.280 align:start position:0%
aid for the buildings they're not
 
01:30:39.750 --> 01:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
allowed to be used for capital expenses
 
01:30:41.750 --> 01:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
so uh you're certainly left with this
 
01:30:42.790 --> 01:30:42.800 align:start position:0%
question if you're going to operate
 
01:30:44.229 --> 01:30:44.239 align:start position:0%
charter school
 
01:30:45.669 --> 01:30:45.679 align:start position:0%
where do you get the building where does
 
01:30:47.430 --> 01:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
it come from and
 
01:30:51.189 --> 01:30:51.199 align:start position:0%
for the sake of size or scope
 
01:30:53.910 --> 01:30:53.920 align:start position:0%
a a school building that would have a
 
01:30:57.350 --> 01:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
300 student capacity is probably
 
01:30:59.030 --> 01:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
something like a three to five million
 
01:31:00.629 --> 01:31:00.639 align:start position:0%
dollar building
 
01:31:01.910 --> 01:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
and that funding's got to come from
 
01:31:04.070 --> 01:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
somewhere um traditionally it's been
 
01:31:05.510 --> 01:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
leased i think we heard last week that
 
01:31:08.390 --> 01:31:08.400 align:start position:0%
there's some one or two or three charter
 
01:31:09.350 --> 01:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
schools that actually own their
 
01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:11.270 align:start position:0%
schools that actually own their
buildings

01:31:11.270 --> 01:31:11.280 align:start position:0%
buildings
 
01:31:13.590 --> 01:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
and so you lease quite a lot of them but
 
01:31:16.870 --> 01:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
obviously renting from somebody else
 
01:31:18.390 --> 01:31:18.400 align:start position:0%
is not as efficient a way to deal with
 
01:31:20.470 --> 01:31:20.480 align:start position:0%
it as to actually own the building and
 
01:31:23.189 --> 01:31:23.199 align:start position:0%
and build it and construct it so
 
01:31:25.669 --> 01:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
bond funding is one avenue to do that um
 
01:31:27.350 --> 01:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
lisa not let me say the building aid
 
01:31:28.550 --> 01:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
that we talked about last week is an
 
01:31:30.790 --> 01:31:30.800 align:start position:0%
avenue to do that you know and there's
 
01:31:33.110 --> 01:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
some other opportunities when it comes
 
01:31:35.030 --> 01:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
to the bond funding and this idea of
 
01:31:36.310 --> 01:31:36.320 align:start position:0%
creating a dialogue with the school
 
01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:37.350 align:start position:0%
creating a dialogue with the school
district

01:31:37.350 --> 01:31:37.360 align:start position:0%
district
 
01:31:39.030 --> 01:31:39.040 align:start position:0%
and allowing them the option to include
 
01:31:40.790 --> 01:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
it or not that doesn't in any way
 
01:31:42.470 --> 01:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
obligate the school district to say we
 
01:31:44.390 --> 01:31:44.400 align:start position:0%
will pay your bonds for you or we'll pay
 
01:31:45.910 --> 01:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
them back for you
 
01:31:48.470 --> 01:31:48.480 align:start position:0%
you can be included in a bond issue and
 
01:31:50.310 --> 01:31:50.320 align:start position:0%
have an agreement that says the charter
 
01:31:52.470 --> 01:31:52.480 align:start position:0%
school pays back the bonds that that it
 
01:31:52.480 --> 01:31:53.350 align:start position:0%
school pays back the bonds that that it
seeks

01:31:53.350 --> 01:31:53.360 align:start position:0%
seeks
 
01:31:55.270 --> 01:31:55.280 align:start position:0%
you can have an agreement that says
 
01:31:57.669 --> 01:31:57.679 align:start position:0%
agreement with the bond buyer that says
 
01:32:00.629 --> 01:32:00.639 align:start position:0%
that x part of these bonds or the series
 
01:32:03.110 --> 01:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
b piece of the bonds are only payable
 
01:32:05.189 --> 01:32:05.199 align:start position:0%
from revenues of the charter school very
 
01:32:08.950 --> 01:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
common in the hefa bonds and other state
 
01:32:11.590 --> 01:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
authority bonds that are issued
 
01:32:12.629 --> 01:32:12.639 align:start position:0%
these are
 
01:32:14.470 --> 01:32:14.480 align:start position:0%
you know not grants from taxpayer money
 
01:32:17.990 --> 01:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
these are loans from some bond buyer and
 
01:32:20.149 --> 01:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
they get paid back and you know it's up
 
01:32:21.590 --> 01:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
to the school district and the charter
 
01:32:23.510 --> 01:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
school to figure out what are the terms
 
01:32:25.350 --> 01:32:25.360 align:start position:0%
between them that the school district
 
01:32:27.910 --> 01:32:27.920 align:start position:0%
finds acceptable that might make the
 
01:32:29.669 --> 01:32:29.679 align:start position:0%
school district willing to say yes you
 
01:32:32.229 --> 01:32:32.239 align:start position:0%
can be a part of my effort
 
01:32:33.669 --> 01:32:33.679 align:start position:0%
and if the school district isn't
 
01:32:35.669 --> 01:32:35.679 align:start position:0%
satisfied with those terms
 
01:32:37.030 --> 01:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
as you've heard from other testimony
 
01:32:38.629 --> 01:32:38.639 align:start position:0%
they can certainly say no but those
 
01:32:40.229 --> 01:32:40.239 align:start position:0%
terms can certainly obligate the charter
 
01:32:41.830 --> 01:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
school it could mortgage the charter
 
01:32:44.709 --> 01:32:44.719 align:start position:0%
schools building uh to pay for or answer
 
01:32:46.790 --> 01:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
for the bonds
 
01:32:48.870 --> 01:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
it obviously has to land in a place
 
01:32:51.590 --> 01:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
where somebody wants to buy the bonds
 
01:32:53.270 --> 01:32:53.280 align:start position:0%
at the interest rate that they pay and
 
01:32:54.950 --> 01:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
that work that depends on credit
 
01:32:54.960 --> 01:32:56.390 align:start position:0%
that work that depends on credit
worthiness

01:32:56.390 --> 01:32:56.400 align:start position:0%
worthiness
 
01:32:58.310 --> 01:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
and security and all the kinds of
 
01:32:59.910 --> 01:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
questions that normal loans are sort of
 
01:33:02.149 --> 01:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
house mortgages bonds are complicated
 
01:33:03.990 --> 01:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
forms but they're just mortgages they're
 
01:33:05.590 --> 01:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
just loans
 
01:33:07.910 --> 01:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
and and credit worthiness is is what
 
01:33:10.310 --> 01:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
bond buyers consider
 
01:33:11.830 --> 01:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
and all of those kinds of things can be
 
01:33:14.070 --> 01:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
tackled there's no circumstance where
 
01:33:15.590 --> 01:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
any school district would be obligated
 
01:33:17.830 --> 01:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
against their will to take on somebody
 
01:33:20.629 --> 01:33:20.639 align:start position:0%
else's responsibility um i think that
 
01:33:22.470 --> 01:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
the bill certainly allows the school
 
01:33:24.149 --> 01:33:24.159 align:start position:0%
district to do that but i don't think
 
01:33:25.669 --> 01:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
anyone really has any practical belief
 
01:33:26.709 --> 01:33:26.719 align:start position:0%
that a school district is going to say
 
01:33:28.950 --> 01:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
yes i'll borrow you know
 
01:33:30.790 --> 01:33:30.800 align:start position:0%
money for you and and we'll pay it back
 
01:33:32.629 --> 01:33:32.639 align:start position:0%
you don't have to um i don't think
 
01:33:34.790 --> 01:33:34.800 align:start position:0%
that's a dialogue anybody expects
 
01:33:36.550 --> 01:33:36.560 align:start position:0%
um so there's there's certainly that
 
01:33:39.590 --> 01:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity um for uh the protections
 
01:33:40.950 --> 01:33:40.960 align:start position:0%
that everybody's talking about who owns
 
01:33:42.390 --> 01:33:42.400 align:start position:0%
the building how does this get paid back
 
01:33:43.910 --> 01:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
how's the school district not at risk
 
01:33:46.149 --> 01:33:46.159 align:start position:0%
how are the taxpayers not at risk all of
 
01:33:48.149 --> 01:33:48.159 align:start position:0%
those things can be solved um they're
 
01:33:50.310 --> 01:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
solved every day in the bonds that are
 
01:33:51.750 --> 01:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
issued by the three
 
01:33:54.390 --> 01:33:54.400 align:start position:0%
state-run bonding authorities
 
01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:55.350 align:start position:0%
state-run bonding authorities
um

01:33:55.350 --> 01:33:55.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:57.110 --> 01:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
and then as to whether there's an
 
01:33:59.750 --> 01:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to share a building or the
 
01:34:01.110 --> 01:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
senate bill
 
01:34:04.149 --> 01:34:04.159 align:start position:0%
house bill 278 i think is the number
 
01:34:05.910 --> 01:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
from last year that made gave the
 
01:34:07.110 --> 01:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
districts the first dibs on the
 
01:34:09.590 --> 01:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
buildings um that's the first dib to you
 
01:34:11.189 --> 01:34:11.199 align:start position:0%
know buy it or rent it it doesn't mean
 
01:34:13.430 --> 01:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
that the school the charter school gets
 
01:34:15.510 --> 01:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
the leftover building for free but even
 
01:34:17.110 --> 01:34:17.120 align:start position:0%
if they did uh
 
01:34:19.189 --> 01:34:19.199 align:start position:0%
and they had a building that was
 
01:34:20.550 --> 01:34:20.560 align:start position:0%
available that a school district didn't
 
01:34:21.910 --> 01:34:21.920 align:start position:0%
want anymore
 
01:34:23.350 --> 01:34:23.360 align:start position:0%
that building probably is in need of
 
01:34:24.709 --> 01:34:24.719 align:start position:0%
some things
 
01:34:25.910 --> 01:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
which is probably why the school
 
01:34:27.430 --> 01:34:27.440 align:start position:0%
district decided they didn't want to use
 
01:34:29.669 --> 01:34:29.679 align:start position:0%
that building anymore so it may be that
 
01:34:31.669 --> 01:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
even if you were able to get access to a
 
01:34:33.510 --> 01:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
building through that bill
 
01:34:35.350 --> 01:34:35.360 align:start position:0%
you need to do a bond issue or a loan or
 
01:34:37.510 --> 01:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
something to modernize the building to
 
01:34:39.350 --> 01:34:39.360 align:start position:0%
bring it up to code to
 
01:34:40.709 --> 01:34:40.719 align:start position:0%
you know install sort of all of the
 
01:34:40.719 --> 01:34:41.910 align:start position:0%
you know install sort of all of the
internet

01:34:41.910 --> 01:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
internet
 
01:34:44.629 --> 01:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
features and now with covid dealing with
 
01:34:46.709 --> 01:34:46.719 align:start position:0%
hvac and all of the ionic whatever
 
01:34:48.470 --> 01:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
that's in the air vents to make sure
 
01:34:50.550 --> 01:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
you're killing all the viruses that go
 
01:34:52.709 --> 01:34:52.719 align:start position:0%
through the air vents and security and
 
01:34:54.149 --> 01:34:54.159 align:start position:0%
all the needs for that you might you
 
01:34:56.310 --> 01:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
might have a building that you um even
 
01:34:58.310 --> 01:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
acquired for free that needs a million
 
01:35:00.390 --> 01:35:00.400 align:start position:0%
dollars worth of upgrades
 
01:35:01.910 --> 01:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
just because of
 
01:35:03.590 --> 01:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
the fact that it was a building this
 
01:35:05.109 --> 01:35:05.119 align:start position:0%
tired building that the school district
 
01:35:07.109 --> 01:35:07.119 align:start position:0%
was ready to pass along
 
01:35:08.550 --> 01:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
you could still be in a position where
 
01:35:11.669 --> 01:35:11.679 align:start position:0%
you need both a benefit of 278 and some
 
01:35:14.470 --> 01:35:14.480 align:start position:0%
other avenue to make use of a building
 
01:35:16.310 --> 01:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
like that
 
01:35:17.510 --> 01:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
i don't think that there's any reason
 
01:35:19.830 --> 01:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
why schools and charter schools couldn't
 
01:35:22.790 --> 01:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
share space if they chose to
 
01:35:24.310 --> 01:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
i think that there are a couple of
 
01:35:25.430 --> 01:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
charter schools that are actually
 
01:35:28.149 --> 01:35:28.159 align:start position:0%
district sponsored charter schools i
 
01:35:29.669 --> 01:35:29.679 align:start position:0%
don't know all the details of that so i
 
01:35:30.950 --> 01:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
don't want to necessarily go down that
 
01:35:32.629 --> 01:35:32.639 align:start position:0%
rabbit hole and try to answer questions
 
01:35:34.390 --> 01:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
about how that works
 
01:35:36.149 --> 01:35:36.159 align:start position:0%
but i think that obviously if they're a
 
01:35:37.910 --> 01:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
district sponsored school
 
01:35:39.350 --> 01:35:39.360 align:start position:0%
the district's got ownership of the
 
01:35:41.750 --> 01:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
charter schools property already
 
01:35:43.750 --> 01:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
so those kinds of patent solutions have
 
01:35:46.070 --> 01:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
already been established
 
01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:47.030 align:start position:0%
already been established
so

01:35:47.030 --> 01:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:35:49.270 --> 01:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
two messages very important for charter
 
01:35:51.830 --> 01:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
schools to have a source of funding for
 
01:35:54.470 --> 01:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
buildings without buildings um you know
 
01:35:56.310 --> 01:35:56.320 align:start position:0%
we're just not going to have the kind of
 
01:35:57.910 --> 01:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
proliferation of charter schools right
 
01:36:00.149 --> 01:36:00.159 align:start position:0%
now there's a handful of uh very
 
01:36:02.229 --> 01:36:02.239 align:start position:0%
generous donors who support the
 
01:36:03.669 --> 01:36:03.679 align:start position:0%
provision of buildings to charter
 
01:36:03.679 --> 01:36:05.109 align:start position:0%
provision of buildings to charter
schools

01:36:05.109 --> 01:36:05.119 align:start position:0%
schools
 
01:36:07.430 --> 01:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
but as we've talked about many times
 
01:36:10.149 --> 01:36:10.159 align:start position:0%
relying on the generosity of a handful
 
01:36:12.390 --> 01:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
of people who are able to do so isn't a
 
01:36:13.350 --> 01:36:13.360 align:start position:0%
way to
 
01:36:15.750 --> 01:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
finance a public
 
01:36:18.149 --> 01:36:18.159 align:start position:0%
school offering
 
01:36:19.750 --> 01:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
second message is as to all the
 
01:36:21.189 --> 01:36:21.199 align:start position:0%
mechanics and logistics that people are
 
01:36:23.189 --> 01:36:23.199 align:start position:0%
concerned about all of those things can
 
01:36:24.950 --> 01:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
be worked out and all of those things
 
01:36:26.629 --> 01:36:26.639 align:start position:0%
can be worked out in a way where the
 
01:36:28.470 --> 01:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
school district first of all can has
 
01:36:30.709 --> 01:36:30.719 align:start position:0%
complete discretion on what to do and
 
01:36:32.310 --> 01:36:32.320 align:start position:0%
complete protection
 
01:36:34.070 --> 01:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
um so that they're not at risk or that
 
01:36:36.629 --> 01:36:36.639 align:start position:0%
they're not required to tax their
 
01:36:38.709 --> 01:36:38.719 align:start position:0%
uh citizens to pay back a charter
 
01:36:40.229 --> 01:36:40.239 align:start position:0%
school's bonds
 
01:36:41.750 --> 01:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
i'm glad to answer any questions anybody
 
01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:42.950 align:start position:0%
i'm glad to answer any questions anybody
has

01:36:42.950 --> 01:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
has
 
01:36:46.310 --> 01:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
uh yes i i have a question for i guess
 
01:36:49.270 --> 01:36:49.280 align:start position:0%
you and others that have testified today
 
01:36:50.629 --> 01:36:50.639 align:start position:0%
we have in the state what we call a
 
01:36:52.870 --> 01:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
school building authority
 
01:36:55.270 --> 01:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
the school building authority as i read
 
01:36:56.709 --> 01:36:56.719 align:start position:0%
upon the receipt of a report from the
 
01:36:58.149 --> 01:36:58.159 align:start position:0%
authority containing a recommendation
 
01:37:00.470 --> 01:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
that bonds or notes of a school district
 
01:37:02.790 --> 01:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
should be guaranteed by the state
 
01:37:05.590 --> 01:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
why is it that this legislation is
 
01:37:06.790 --> 01:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
01:37:08.470 --> 01:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
drive these bonds through the school
 
01:37:11.189 --> 01:37:11.199 align:start position:0%
district rather than the state which has
 
01:37:13.189 --> 01:37:13.199 align:start position:0%
authority to issue bonds up to not to
 
01:37:15.590 --> 01:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
exceed 95 million dollars
 
01:37:16.950 --> 01:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
you know i don't know the ins and outs
 
01:37:18.790 --> 01:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
of exactly the way the state deals with
 
01:37:21.030 --> 01:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
its bonding directly where the state is
 
01:37:22.629 --> 01:37:22.639 align:start position:0%
responsible for the bonds or even where
 
01:37:24.070 --> 01:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
the school districts are
 
01:37:26.470 --> 01:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
my experience with those is that the um
 
01:37:28.149 --> 01:37:28.159 align:start position:0%
the three bonding authorities where the
 
01:37:30.629 --> 01:37:30.639 align:start position:0%
state is explicitly not obligated on the
 
01:37:32.229 --> 01:37:32.239 align:start position:0%
bonds and that's why i bring that
 
01:37:33.750 --> 01:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
message as to how that could be the case
 
01:37:35.830 --> 01:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
with charter schools as far as how it
 
01:37:37.590 --> 01:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
works where there's some recommendation
 
01:37:39.669 --> 01:37:39.679 align:start position:0%
of a committee that the state support
 
01:37:40.870 --> 01:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
that funding
 
01:37:42.390 --> 01:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
i honestly don't know enough about that
 
01:37:44.229 --> 01:37:44.239 align:start position:0%
to offer any comment that's useful thank
 
01:37:44.239 --> 01:37:45.350 align:start position:0%
to offer any comment that's useful thank
you

01:37:45.350 --> 01:37:45.360 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:37:47.510 --> 01:37:47.520 align:start position:0%

01:37:48.390 --> 01:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:37:49.910 --> 01:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
so you said that you know a lot about
 
01:37:52.709 --> 01:37:52.719 align:start position:0%
the bonding market given the lack of
 
01:37:54.390 --> 01:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
resources that these charter schools
 
01:37:56.229 --> 01:37:56.239 align:start position:0%
have and given that they're not
 
01:37:59.750 --> 01:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
guaranteed by a state or a city wouldn't
 
01:38:01.430 --> 01:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
the market just consider these junk
 
01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:03.030 align:start position:0%
the market just consider these junk
bonds

01:38:03.030 --> 01:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
bonds
 
01:38:03.040 --> 01:38:03.830 align:start position:0%
bonds
so

01:38:03.830 --> 01:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:38:05.669 --> 01:38:05.679 align:start position:0%
whether the market would do that or not
 
01:38:07.189 --> 01:38:07.199 align:start position:0%
or whether the market would even buy the
 
01:38:08.390 --> 01:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
bonds um
 
01:38:10.629 --> 01:38:10.639 align:start position:0%
when there's a when there's a
 
01:38:12.470 --> 01:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
bond offering through one of the bonding
 
01:38:13.990 --> 01:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
authorities at the state
 
01:38:15.910 --> 01:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
the buyer is sort of identified buyer of
 
01:38:17.430 --> 01:38:17.440 align:start position:0%
those bonds and the rates and the terms
 
01:38:18.709 --> 01:38:18.719 align:start position:0%
and all of that are lined up by the
 
01:38:20.629 --> 01:38:20.639 align:start position:0%
borrower before they're even brought to
 
01:38:22.149 --> 01:38:22.159 align:start position:0%
the authority so we know that citizens
 
01:38:23.750 --> 01:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
bank is going to buy all of the bonds
 
01:38:25.270 --> 01:38:25.280 align:start position:0%
for a particular issue or you name the
 
01:38:25.280 --> 01:38:26.390 align:start position:0%
for a particular issue or you name the
bank

01:38:26.390 --> 01:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
bank
 
01:38:28.950 --> 01:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
and if the borrower can't find a bank or
 
01:38:30.870 --> 01:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
a lender that's willing to offer and buy
 
01:38:32.149 --> 01:38:32.159 align:start position:0%
those bonds
 
01:38:34.870 --> 01:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
the authority nothing happens the bonds
 
01:38:36.070 --> 01:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
could be issued but nobody's going to
 
01:38:37.830 --> 01:38:37.840 align:start position:0%
purchase them and nobody got any money
 
01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:39.910 align:start position:0%
purchase them and nobody got any money
and

01:38:39.910 --> 01:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:38:41.430 --> 01:38:41.440 align:start position:0%
you know essentially the
 
01:38:43.270 --> 01:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
deal doesn't obligate anybody to
 
01:38:45.030 --> 01:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
anything because
 
01:38:46.790 --> 01:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
um it's like applying for a car loan and
 
01:38:48.229 --> 01:38:48.239 align:start position:0%
then getting turned down
 
01:38:50.629 --> 01:38:50.639 align:start position:0%
you don't have a loan
 
01:38:51.669 --> 01:38:51.679 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
01:38:53.189 --> 01:38:53.199 align:start position:0%
so i don't understand how you're saying
 
01:38:54.870 --> 01:38:54.880 align:start position:0%
that it's all lined up ahead of time
 
01:38:56.390 --> 01:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
we're in the bond market all the time
 
01:38:58.229 --> 01:38:58.239 align:start position:0%
buying bonds and you buy municipal bonds
 
01:39:00.229 --> 01:39:00.239 align:start position:0%
you can buy all kinds of bonds issued by
 
01:39:02.390 --> 01:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
governmental entities what do you mean
 
01:39:04.390 --> 01:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
that they would be only only go to
 
01:39:06.149 --> 01:39:06.159 align:start position:0%
market if they're picked up by a bank of
 
01:39:07.910 --> 01:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
course there's other kinds of bonds out
 
01:39:09.830 --> 01:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
there that aren't picked up by a bank
 
01:39:11.510 --> 01:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
but they are issued by governmental
 
01:39:14.790 --> 01:39:14.800 align:start position:0%
authorities sure um there are obviously
 
01:39:16.390 --> 01:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
private placement and public placement
 
01:39:17.910 --> 01:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
bonds i didn't mean to misspeak about
 
01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:18.709 align:start position:0%
bonds i didn't mean to misspeak about
that

01:39:18.709 --> 01:39:18.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:39:21.990 --> 01:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
the private the public placement bonds
 
01:39:23.350 --> 01:39:23.360 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry the
 
01:39:25.669 --> 01:39:25.679 align:start position:0%
public offerings of bonds are done
 
01:39:27.430 --> 01:39:27.440 align:start position:0%
through a bond trustee who is doing that
 
01:39:29.510 --> 01:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
same level of evaluation about the
 
01:39:31.189 --> 01:39:31.199 align:start position:0%
quality of the bonds and are they rated
 
01:39:32.629 --> 01:39:32.639 align:start position:0%
and moody's and all of that kind of
 
01:39:34.709 --> 01:39:34.719 align:start position:0%
thing and ultimately if somebody doesn't
 
01:39:36.790 --> 01:39:36.800 align:start position:0%
buy the bonds because they believe that
 
01:39:38.310 --> 01:39:38.320 align:start position:0%
they're rated wrong or that they're high
 
01:39:40.470 --> 01:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
risk or something like that again it's
 
01:39:43.830 --> 01:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
just a loan that didn't go through
 
01:39:45.350 --> 01:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
representative porter
 
01:39:48.390 --> 01:39:48.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman just very quickly
 
01:39:50.870 --> 01:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
my understanding if this went through
 
01:39:52.629 --> 01:39:52.639 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:39:54.550 --> 01:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
charter was responsible for paying back
 
01:39:57.430 --> 01:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
the bond you talked about credit rating
 
01:40:00.070 --> 01:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
if the charter defaulted on the bond
 
01:40:02.149 --> 01:40:02.159 align:start position:0%
would that negatively impact the credit
 
01:40:04.709 --> 01:40:04.719 align:start position:0%
rating of the school for future bonds
 
01:40:06.390 --> 01:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
the school district for future bonds
 
01:40:09.109 --> 01:40:09.119 align:start position:0%
just a simple yes or no is all i need
 
01:40:10.870 --> 01:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
it's a great question and i think it
 
01:40:13.350 --> 01:40:13.360 align:start position:0%
depends i know that you want yes or no
 
01:40:15.750 --> 01:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
if the school district and the charter
 
01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:16.709 align:start position:0%
if the school district and the charter
school

01:40:16.709 --> 01:40:16.719 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:40:18.629 --> 01:40:18.639 align:start position:0%
arranged some of that financing the way
 
01:40:20.629 --> 01:40:20.639 align:start position:0%
that it's done on a state level it would
 
01:40:22.149 --> 01:40:22.159 align:start position:0%
not affect the state's credit rating
 
01:40:24.229 --> 01:40:24.239 align:start position:0%
which is similar to the
 
01:40:25.590 --> 01:40:25.600 align:start position:0%
bonds that are offered through business
 
01:40:26.950 --> 01:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
finance authority and the housing
 
01:40:28.870 --> 01:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
finance authority they don't affect the
 
01:40:31.830 --> 01:40:31.840 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire's credit rating
 
01:40:33.189 --> 01:40:33.199 align:start position:0%
no i was talking about the school
 
01:40:35.510 --> 01:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
district's credit rating sure and that's
 
01:40:37.109 --> 01:40:37.119 align:start position:0%
what i mean is that within the documents
 
01:40:38.470 --> 01:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
of the way the bond issue's done there's
 
01:40:40.470 --> 01:40:40.480 align:start position:0%
ways to arrange it so that it doesn't
 
01:40:42.229 --> 01:40:42.239 align:start position:0%
affect the school district's credit
 
01:40:42.239 --> 01:40:43.590 align:start position:0%
affect the school district's credit
rating

01:40:43.590 --> 01:40:43.600 align:start position:0%
rating
 
01:40:45.270 --> 01:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
but whether the school district and the
 
01:40:47.590 --> 01:40:47.600 align:start position:0%
charter school would
 
01:40:49.990 --> 01:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
do all of those things is up to them to
 
01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:51.669 align:start position:0%
do all of those things is up to them to
achieve

01:40:51.669 --> 01:40:51.679 align:start position:0%
achieve
 
01:40:52.790 --> 01:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
thank you

01:51:56.870 --> 01:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
projection so thanks okay we have one
 
01:51:59.030 --> 01:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
speaker on that we have becky wilson
 
01:52:00.550 --> 01:52:00.560 align:start position:0%
from the new hampshire school boards
 
01:52:00.560 --> 01:52:05.910 align:start position:0%
from the new hampshire school boards
association

01:52:05.910 --> 01:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:09.830 --> 01:52:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:11.669 --> 01:52:11.679 align:start position:0%
good morning morning chairman laden
 
01:52:12.870 --> 01:52:12.880 align:start position:0%
members of the committee thanks for
 
01:52:15.270 --> 01:52:15.280 align:start position:0%
hearing my testimony today i will be
 
01:52:16.550 --> 01:52:16.560 align:start position:0%
expedient because i know you have quite
 
01:52:18.550 --> 01:52:18.560 align:start position:0%
a few people for the next hearing
 
01:52:20.470 --> 01:52:20.480 align:start position:0%
i did submit some comments and writing
 
01:52:21.830 --> 01:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
already to the committee around this
 
01:52:21.840 --> 01:52:22.709 align:start position:0%
already to the committee around this
bill

01:52:22.709 --> 01:52:22.719 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:52:24.950 --> 01:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
we are in opposition of this bill we
 
01:52:27.510 --> 01:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
feel like that school boards already do
 
01:52:28.950 --> 01:52:28.960 align:start position:0%
an extraordinary job and take
 
01:52:31.669 --> 01:52:31.679 align:start position:0%
extraordinary care to try to be mindful
 
01:52:33.830 --> 01:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
of the impacts not only on the students
 
01:52:35.189 --> 01:52:35.199 align:start position:0%
when they're developing the budget but
 
01:52:36.709 --> 01:52:36.719 align:start position:0%
on the local taxpayers in their
 
01:52:38.629 --> 01:52:38.639 align:start position:0%
community there are multiple
 
01:52:40.470 --> 01:52:40.480 align:start position:0%
opportunities for community members to
 
01:52:43.189 --> 01:52:43.199 align:start position:0%
engage in the budget development process
 
01:52:45.430 --> 01:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
and to adjust the operating budget of
 
01:52:47.030 --> 01:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
the school as they go through these
 
01:52:49.669 --> 01:52:49.679 align:start position:0%
budget processes each year
 
01:52:52.550 --> 01:52:52.560 align:start position:0%
the inflation rate annually is not
 
01:52:54.709 --> 01:52:54.719 align:start position:0%
published until january of the following
 
01:52:57.270 --> 01:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
year most of your school districts
 
01:52:59.350 --> 01:52:59.360 align:start position:0%
budgets have been worked on since
 
01:53:01.910 --> 01:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
october at that point
 
01:53:04.310 --> 01:53:04.320 align:start position:0%
to require districts to have to make
 
01:53:05.589 --> 01:53:05.599 align:start position:0%
cuts or
 
01:53:08.390 --> 01:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
develop a plan somehow to reduce the
 
01:53:09.990 --> 01:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
operating budget that the town has
 
01:53:11.990 --> 01:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
already had multiple opportunities to
 
01:53:14.550 --> 01:53:14.560 align:start position:0%
weigh in on seems
 
01:53:15.990 --> 01:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
like a very large burden that would
 
01:53:17.270 --> 01:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
create a lot of
 
01:53:18.870 --> 01:53:18.880 align:start position:0%
discourse with the school districts in
 
01:53:20.310 --> 01:53:20.320 align:start position:0%
terms of trying to
 
01:53:21.990 --> 01:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
cut programs that have already been
 
01:53:25.990 --> 01:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
budgeted for for the following year
 
01:53:28.470 --> 01:53:28.480 align:start position:0%
will not read my entire testimony but on
 
01:53:29.910 --> 01:53:29.920 align:start position:0%
top of that you know this bill also
 
01:53:31.990 --> 01:53:32.000 align:start position:0%
seems to require that if you were going
 
01:53:33.990 --> 01:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
to present a budget to the town for a
 
01:53:37.109 --> 01:53:37.119 align:start position:0%
vote or a deliberative session that was
 
01:53:40.390 --> 01:53:40.400 align:start position:0%
um had a higher rate of than the current
 
01:53:41.990 --> 01:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
inflation rate that you would have to
 
01:53:44.229 --> 01:53:44.239 align:start position:0%
then present this plan to for cuts and
 
01:53:46.550 --> 01:53:46.560 align:start position:0%
or for consolidation
 
01:53:48.149 --> 01:53:48.159 align:start position:0%
and there's been other bills before this
 
01:53:49.589 --> 01:53:49.599 align:start position:0%
committee to
 
01:53:52.070 --> 01:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
dissolve consolidation so it seems a
 
01:53:54.550 --> 01:53:54.560 align:start position:0%
little confusing quite honestly to
 
01:53:56.470 --> 01:53:56.480 align:start position:0%
expect districts to be able to do that
 
01:53:58.390 --> 01:53:58.400 align:start position:0%
and enrollment is not the only driver of
 
01:54:00.229 --> 01:54:00.239 align:start position:0%
a school district budget it is an
 
01:54:01.990 --> 01:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
important driver and most districts do
 
01:54:04.550 --> 01:54:04.560 align:start position:0%
maintain to the best of their ability
 
01:54:06.950 --> 01:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
some sort of enrollment trends that they
 
01:54:08.470 --> 01:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
can look at when they're creating these
 
01:54:10.629 --> 01:54:10.639 align:start position:0%
budgets that's why sometimes there's
 
01:54:12.470 --> 01:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
five second grades one year and three
 
01:54:14.470 --> 01:54:14.480 align:start position:0%
the following year but there are a
 
01:54:17.270 --> 01:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
number of options now for families
 
01:54:19.270 --> 01:54:19.280 align:start position:0%
in terms of how to educate their
 
01:54:21.990 --> 01:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
children in this state and it creates
 
01:54:23.910 --> 01:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
some difficulty when you're trying as a
 
01:54:25.270 --> 01:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
school district to predict your
 
01:54:25.280 --> 01:54:26.390 align:start position:0%
school district to predict your
enrollment

01:54:26.390 --> 01:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
enrollment
 
01:54:28.470 --> 01:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
there's no notification requirement for
 
01:54:30.070 --> 01:54:30.080 align:start position:0%
the school district to be told if
 
01:54:31.910 --> 01:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
students are moving into an old-school
 
01:54:35.510 --> 01:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
situation or an efa situation
 
01:54:37.750 --> 01:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
there are no guard rails in terms of
 
01:54:39.589 --> 01:54:39.599 align:start position:0%
districts being able to predict which
 
01:54:41.270 --> 01:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
students will enter the school district
 
01:54:42.950 --> 01:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
even using the town report which i know
 
01:54:45.189 --> 01:54:45.199 align:start position:0%
a lot of districts do that to look at
 
01:54:47.270 --> 01:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
the number of live births for a given
 
01:54:48.629 --> 01:54:48.639 align:start position:0%
year and try to predict when those
 
01:54:51.589 --> 01:54:51.599 align:start position:0%
students will enter the system so
 
01:54:52.709 --> 01:54:52.719 align:start position:0%
with that i'm happy to take any
 
01:54:54.629 --> 01:54:54.639 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much are there
 
01:54:57.669 --> 01:54:57.679 align:start position:0%
questions for becky wilson
 
01:54:59.270 --> 01:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
from the school boards association not
 
01:55:05.109 --> 01:55:05.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:16.149 --> 01:55:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:18.550 --> 01:55:18.560 align:start position:0%
the next bill on the docket for today is
 
01:55:21.830 --> 01:55:21.840 align:start position:0%
hb 1663 relative to requirements for
 
01:55:30.470 --> 01:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:49.510 --> 01:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:37.910 --> 01:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:41.750 --> 01:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:43.910 --> 01:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
we need to have a representative in here
 
01:59:01.830 --> 01:59:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:04.229 --> 01:59:04.239 align:start position:0%
i have not seen an amendment in fact
 
01:59:05.990 --> 01:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
there is no amendment that's a committee
 
01:59:07.589 --> 01:59:07.599 align:start position:0%
amendment until it's presented by a
 
01:59:10.310 --> 01:59:10.320 align:start position:0%
committee member so a lot of people can
 
01:59:11.990 --> 01:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
draw up amendments i'm not interested in
 
01:59:13.669 --> 01:59:13.679 align:start position:0%
that i'm interested only in the bill
 
01:59:18.870 --> 01:59:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:26.310 --> 01:59:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:27.990 --> 01:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:59:28.950 --> 01:59:28.960 align:start position:0%
i just
 
01:59:30.950 --> 01:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
have some guidelines for how we're going
 
01:59:34.390 --> 01:59:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:36.229 --> 01:59:36.239 align:start position:0%
i don't want to have a lot of
 
01:59:38.790 --> 01:59:38.800 align:start position:0%
duplication in what you're saying you
 
01:59:40.149 --> 01:59:40.159 align:start position:0%
know if we are we're going to have to
 
01:59:41.830 --> 01:59:41.840 align:start position:0%
get down to time limits and it might
 
01:59:45.189 --> 01:59:45.199 align:start position:0%
even get down to like a minute a person
 
01:59:47.030 --> 01:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
so that if you're
 
01:59:49.030 --> 01:59:49.040 align:start position:0%
everybody has a story i understand that
 
01:59:50.870 --> 01:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
we appreciate the story but if the story
 
01:59:53.430 --> 01:59:53.440 align:start position:0%
is on the same vein
 
01:59:55.030 --> 01:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
don't give it
 
01:59:57.189 --> 01:59:57.199 align:start position:0%
if it's already been given
 
01:59:59.750 --> 01:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
so please follow the rules or else we
 
02:00:03.750 --> 02:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
will immediately put in time constraints
 
02:00:05.189 --> 02:00:05.199 align:start position:0%
and in some committees where that's
 
02:00:05.199 --> 02:00:06.229 align:start position:0%
and in some committees where that's
occurred

02:00:06.229 --> 02:00:06.239 align:start position:0%
occurred
 
02:00:08.149 --> 02:00:08.159 align:start position:0%
the hearing is stopped
 
02:00:12.229 --> 02:00:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:15.350 --> 02:00:15.360 align:start position:0%
go ahead and i'd like to represent a
 
02:00:18.470 --> 02:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
welcome representative uh leon here for
 
02:00:21.270 --> 02:00:21.280 align:start position:0%
introducing this bill thank you
 
02:00:22.390 --> 02:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
02:00:24.229 --> 02:00:24.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for having me here today for
 
02:00:26.950 --> 02:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
the record i am erica leon representing
 
02:00:29.510 --> 02:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
rockingham six which is dairy
 
02:00:31.350 --> 02:00:31.360 align:start position:0%
i come before you today in order to
 
02:00:33.270 --> 02:00:33.280 align:start position:0%
address ambu ambiguities and
 
02:00:34.629 --> 02:00:34.639 align:start position:0%
difficulties in the current home
 
02:00:36.390 --> 02:00:36.400 align:start position:0%
education law
 
02:00:38.149 --> 02:00:38.159 align:start position:0%
they have impacted our communities and
 
02:00:39.430 --> 02:00:39.440 align:start position:0%
in particular families that are
 
02:00:41.510 --> 02:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
struggling to find a safe and nurturing
 
02:00:43.350 --> 02:00:43.360 align:start position:0%
education for their children during
 
02:00:45.430 --> 02:00:45.440 align:start position:0%
these last two years of covid
 
02:00:47.669 --> 02:00:47.679 align:start position:0%
these changes don't impact the taxpayers
 
02:00:49.350 --> 02:00:49.360 align:start position:0%
and the guidance provided to schools and
 
02:00:51.589 --> 02:00:51.599 align:start position:0%
their interactions with homeschoolers is
 
02:00:53.189 --> 02:00:53.199 align:start position:0%
focused on equity
 
02:00:55.830 --> 02:00:55.840 align:start position:0%
however the greatest impact on equity is
 
02:00:57.589 --> 02:00:57.599 align:start position:0%
in a change to the annual assessment
 
02:00:59.510 --> 02:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
language to be more inclusive of our
 
02:01:01.350 --> 02:01:01.360 align:start position:0%
large and growing special education
 
02:01:03.510 --> 02:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
homeschooling community and those with
 
02:01:05.430 --> 02:01:05.440 align:start position:0%
learning loss before they chose to
 
02:01:09.750 --> 02:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
educate at home under rsa 193a
 
02:01:12.070 --> 02:01:12.080 align:start position:0%
section 1 addresses equal access which
 
02:01:13.990 --> 02:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
has been proven to be a significant
 
02:01:16.310 --> 02:01:16.320 align:start position:0%
challenge one that others here such as
 
02:01:17.990 --> 02:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
amanda whedon the special needs
 
02:01:19.990 --> 02:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
homeschooling representative on hiac
 
02:01:22.550 --> 02:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
will address later in her testimony
 
02:01:25.030 --> 02:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
this section changes may to shell in
 
02:01:26.709 --> 02:01:26.719 align:start position:0%
regards to school boards adopting a
 
02:01:28.870 --> 02:01:28.880 align:start position:0%
policy regarding participation in equal
 
02:01:28.880 --> 02:01:29.830 align:start position:0%
policy regarding participation in equal
access

02:01:29.830 --> 02:01:29.840 align:start position:0%
access
 
02:01:31.350 --> 02:01:31.360 align:start position:0%
i believe many of the problems we've
 
02:01:33.350 --> 02:01:33.360 align:start position:0%
seen this year aren't because they don't
 
02:01:35.189 --> 02:01:35.199 align:start position:0%
want to provide this access but because
 
02:01:37.350 --> 02:01:37.360 align:start position:0%
they don't know how so finding the 30
 
02:01:39.109 --> 02:01:39.119 align:start position:0%
districts that don't have a policy and
 
02:01:40.870 --> 02:01:40.880 align:start position:0%
having them put one on the books would
 
02:01:42.709 --> 02:01:42.719 align:start position:0%
be very helpful so that people know the
 
02:01:42.719 --> 02:01:43.910 align:start position:0%
be very helpful so that people know the
rules

02:01:43.910 --> 02:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
rules
 
02:01:45.669 --> 02:01:45.679 align:start position:0%
section 2 provides a more complete
 
02:01:47.830 --> 02:01:47.840 align:start position:0%
definition of how education is delivered
 
02:01:49.030 --> 02:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
at home
 
02:01:51.189 --> 02:01:51.199 align:start position:0%
as many parents seek out specialists or
 
02:01:53.030 --> 02:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
workshop experiences to enhance
 
02:01:55.270 --> 02:01:55.280 align:start position:0%
educational opportunities and it also
 
02:01:56.709 --> 02:01:56.719 align:start position:0%
removes some words that have created a
 
02:01:58.390 --> 02:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
lot of confusion
 
02:02:00.550 --> 02:02:00.560 align:start position:0%
section 3 addresses notification and in
 
02:02:02.950 --> 02:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
particular confusion about when a family
 
02:02:04.310 --> 02:02:04.320 align:start position:0%
that moves out of district needs to
 
02:02:05.990 --> 02:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
notify and whom
 
02:02:07.830 --> 02:02:07.840 align:start position:0%
this essentially provides a framework
 
02:02:09.669 --> 02:02:09.679 align:start position:0%
that notifying through the dis well it
 
02:02:11.510 --> 02:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
establishes the existing framework and
 
02:02:13.430 --> 02:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
puts it into the law not the rules that
 
02:02:15.270 --> 02:02:15.280 align:start position:0%
people don't know to look for especially
 
02:02:17.669 --> 02:02:17.679 align:start position:0%
as a new homeschooler it makes it clear
 
02:02:19.589 --> 02:02:19.599 align:start position:0%
that notifying through the district or a
 
02:02:21.750 --> 02:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
non-public school is statewide so if you
 
02:02:23.750 --> 02:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
move within the state you're covered but
 
02:02:26.310 --> 02:02:26.320 align:start position:0%
if you notify a local school district if
 
02:02:27.830 --> 02:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
you move from that district you tell
 
02:02:29.750 --> 02:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
them that you've moved and then you
 
02:02:33.030 --> 02:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
notify the new district
 
02:02:35.030 --> 02:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
it's current and as i said it's in the
 
02:02:37.189 --> 02:02:37.199 align:start position:0%
rules but especially our new homeschool
 
02:02:38.550 --> 02:02:38.560 align:start position:0%
parents don't even know that there's
 
02:02:40.470 --> 02:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
home school rules
 
02:02:42.870 --> 02:02:42.880 align:start position:0%
i do have some language that i can offer
 
02:02:44.950 --> 02:02:44.960 align:start position:0%
that that does have some clarifications
 
02:02:46.629 --> 02:02:46.639 align:start position:0%
because admittedly some of that language
 
02:02:49.030 --> 02:02:49.040 align:start position:0%
is clunky so i have some to offer but i
 
02:02:50.550 --> 02:02:50.560 align:start position:0%
know it comes through the committee i
 
02:02:52.070 --> 02:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
just wanted to try and fix my own
 
02:02:54.310 --> 02:02:54.320 align:start position:0%
mistakes instead of putting all that
 
02:02:56.229 --> 02:02:56.239 align:start position:0%
burden on you
 
02:02:58.870 --> 02:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
section 4 is the major equity issue here
 
02:03:00.550 --> 02:03:00.560 align:start position:0%
and i want to be clear that we know
 
02:03:03.030 --> 02:03:03.040 align:start position:0%
exactly who we're discussing today
 
02:03:04.790 --> 02:03:04.800 align:start position:0%
this is the only bill in front of the
 
02:03:06.310 --> 02:03:06.320 align:start position:0%
committee this year
 
02:03:09.990 --> 02:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
that deals with 193 a homeschoolers
 
02:03:11.589 --> 02:03:11.599 align:start position:0%
these are the classic homeschoolers the
 
02:03:13.990 --> 02:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
ones we've always known before this new
 
02:03:16.310 --> 02:03:16.320 align:start position:0%
efa program those ones are regulated
 
02:03:18.390 --> 02:03:18.400 align:start position:0%
separately under another section
 
02:03:19.669 --> 02:03:19.679 align:start position:0%
these are the families that pay their
 
02:03:21.510 --> 02:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
property taxes to support their public
 
02:03:21.520 --> 02:03:22.629 align:start position:0%
property taxes to support their public
school

02:03:22.629 --> 02:03:22.639 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:03:24.709 --> 02:03:24.719 align:start position:0%
but don't send their kids there and they
 
02:03:27.030 --> 02:03:27.040 align:start position:0%
take the time money and effort to
 
02:03:29.830 --> 02:03:29.840 align:start position:0%
educate their kids themselves at home
 
02:03:31.910 --> 02:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
with whatever specialist they they work
 
02:03:31.920 --> 02:03:32.950 align:start position:0%
with whatever specialist they they work
with

02:03:32.950 --> 02:03:32.960 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:03:34.629 --> 02:03:34.639 align:start position:0%
and do it at their own expense without
 
02:03:38.709 --> 02:03:38.719 align:start position:0%
taking a penny from the taxpayers
 
02:03:40.790 --> 02:03:40.800 align:start position:0%
they want to do everything right and
 
02:03:42.870 --> 02:03:42.880 align:start position:0%
these are the families that not only
 
02:03:44.470 --> 02:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
want to know what the laws are but they
 
02:03:46.390 --> 02:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that they're clear so
 
02:03:48.470 --> 02:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
they aren't making a mistake
 
02:03:50.310 --> 02:03:50.320 align:start position:0%
these parents take education and
 
02:03:52.229 --> 02:03:52.239 align:start position:0%
accuracy seriously
 
02:03:52.239 --> 02:03:53.109 align:start position:0%
accuracy seriously
so

02:03:53.109 --> 02:03:53.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:03:55.189 --> 02:03:55.199 align:start position:0%
fixing this language to make it easier
 
02:03:57.270 --> 02:03:57.280 align:start position:0%
to follow would be a huge benefit for
 
02:03:59.109 --> 02:03:59.119 align:start position:0%
them so that instead of trying to figure
 
02:04:00.550 --> 02:04:00.560 align:start position:0%
out the intricacies of our laws and
 
02:04:02.550 --> 02:04:02.560 align:start position:0%
rules they can focus on educating their
 
02:04:02.560 --> 02:04:04.310 align:start position:0%
rules they can focus on educating their
children

02:04:04.310 --> 02:04:04.320 align:start position:0%
children
 
02:04:06.229 --> 02:04:06.239 align:start position:0%
now some of these students learn and
 
02:04:07.990 --> 02:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
test well above grade level you'll hear
 
02:04:09.510 --> 02:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
testimony from the national home
 
02:04:11.669 --> 02:04:11.679 align:start position:0%
education research institute about the
 
02:04:13.750 --> 02:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
tremendous performance of homeschoolers
 
02:04:15.189 --> 02:04:15.199 align:start position:0%
if advanced students want to use
 
02:04:16.790 --> 02:04:16.800 align:start position:0%
national assessments that are two or
 
02:04:18.550 --> 02:04:18.560 align:start position:0%
three years ahead just to find the weak
 
02:04:20.950 --> 02:04:20.960 align:start position:0%
spots do they have to take one at grade
 
02:04:22.830 --> 02:04:22.840 align:start position:0%
level to show that they can meet these
 
02:04:24.709 --> 02:04:24.719 align:start position:0%
standards and then we have other
 
02:04:26.550 --> 02:04:26.560 align:start position:0%
students that don't test well
 
02:04:28.310 --> 02:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
or maybe they're really far ahead in
 
02:04:30.629 --> 02:04:30.639 align:start position:0%
reading but math is hard for them and
 
02:04:31.990 --> 02:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
instead of trying to advance them
 
02:04:33.350 --> 02:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
they're digging in and building those
 
02:04:35.030 --> 02:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
foundations even if it's at a slower
 
02:04:37.270 --> 02:04:37.280 align:start position:0%
pace if their math score is 20th
 
02:04:39.270 --> 02:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
percentile and their reading is 99th
 
02:04:39.280 --> 02:04:40.709 align:start position:0%
percentile and their reading is 99th
percentile

02:04:40.709 --> 02:04:40.719 align:start position:0%
percentile
 
02:04:43.189 --> 02:04:43.199 align:start position:0%
do we average it the law is silent and
 
02:04:45.669 --> 02:04:45.679 align:start position:0%
it leads to a lot of fear and confusion
 
02:04:47.830 --> 02:04:47.840 align:start position:0%
removing that 40th percentile would be
 
02:04:49.750 --> 02:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
consistent with most of the other states
 
02:04:51.669 --> 02:04:51.679 align:start position:0%
in this country and even more
 
02:04:53.750 --> 02:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
importantly it's consistent with every
 
02:04:56.069 --> 02:04:56.079 align:start position:0%
single funded student in the state
 
02:04:58.550 --> 02:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
all of the taxpayer-funded students
 
02:05:00.149 --> 02:05:00.159 align:start position:0%
not a single one of them has to hit a
 
02:05:01.830 --> 02:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
certain score
 
02:05:04.629 --> 02:05:04.639 align:start position:0%
yet we ask that of our
 
02:05:08.390 --> 02:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
entirely self-funded homeschoolers
 
02:05:10.390 --> 02:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
so section 5 addresses a long-standing
 
02:05:12.709 --> 02:05:12.719 align:start position:0%
issue but with covet it's even more
 
02:05:14.790 --> 02:05:14.800 align:start position:0%
important we had a lot of families that
 
02:05:16.149 --> 02:05:16.159 align:start position:0%
never wanted to leave their public
 
02:05:18.629 --> 02:05:18.639 align:start position:0%
school but either because they didn't
 
02:05:20.629 --> 02:05:20.639 align:start position:0%
like the masks or
 
02:05:22.390 --> 02:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
they thought the risk even with masks
 
02:05:23.830 --> 02:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
was too high
 
02:05:25.589 --> 02:05:25.599 align:start position:0%
they chose to step out of the public
 
02:05:27.030 --> 02:05:27.040 align:start position:0%
school until they were comfortable
 
02:05:28.950 --> 02:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
returning some of these families have
 
02:05:30.550 --> 02:05:30.560 align:start position:0%
been asked for a portfolio to go back
 
02:05:32.870 --> 02:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
into third grade
 
02:05:34.790 --> 02:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
the language was clucky i have a better
 
02:05:36.870 --> 02:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
section to offer to suggest it in but i
 
02:05:38.709 --> 02:05:38.719 align:start position:0%
know i'm not introducing the amendments
 
02:05:41.510 --> 02:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
so that we can leave to later
 
02:05:44.149 --> 02:05:44.159 align:start position:0%
and also just discussing the rules doing
 
02:05:45.669 --> 02:05:45.679 align:start position:0%
rules changes
 
02:05:47.669 --> 02:05:47.679 align:start position:0%
everything that's in the rules for
 
02:05:50.870 --> 02:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
homeschooling is already in the law
 
02:05:53.030 --> 02:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
it's redundant it has some clarification
 
02:05:55.109 --> 02:05:55.119 align:start position:0%
that people look to but all of the
 
02:05:57.350 --> 02:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
important points are already in the law
 
02:05:59.030 --> 02:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
so to summarize today we're talking
 
02:06:01.589 --> 02:06:01.599 align:start position:0%
about the unfunded 193a homeschoolers
 
02:06:03.270 --> 02:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
who subsidize the education of their
 
02:06:05.350 --> 02:06:05.360 align:start position:0%
neighbors while not taking a penny of
 
02:06:08.149 --> 02:06:08.159 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money to educate their children
 
02:06:10.310 --> 02:06:10.320 align:start position:0%
these families invest time effort and
 
02:06:12.390 --> 02:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
their own money into providing the best
 
02:06:15.669 --> 02:06:15.679 align:start position:0%
individualized education for their kids
 
02:06:17.910 --> 02:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
these families look closely to the law
 
02:06:19.750 --> 02:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
because they are conscientious and want
 
02:06:21.270 --> 02:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
the best for their kids
 
02:06:23.990 --> 02:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
and these students these unfunded 193a
 
02:06:25.910 --> 02:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers currently have to fight
 
02:06:28.550 --> 02:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
for equal access in public schools
 
02:06:30.229 --> 02:06:30.239 align:start position:0%
stress about whether tapping subject
 
02:06:31.910 --> 02:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
matter experts in group workshops for
 
02:06:33.109 --> 02:06:33.119 align:start position:0%
more than 50 percent of their
 
02:06:35.189 --> 02:06:35.199 align:start position:0%
educational time is okay
 
02:06:37.189 --> 02:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
and how to handle notifications if they
 
02:06:39.510 --> 02:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
move whether they need to worry about
 
02:06:41.109 --> 02:06:41.119 align:start position:0%
how they're demonstrating reasonable
 
02:06:42.950 --> 02:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
academic proficiency standards that are
 
02:06:45.189 --> 02:06:45.199 align:start position:0%
more strict than any other student
 
02:06:46.470 --> 02:06:46.480 align:start position:0%
and about whether their students
 
02:06:48.310 --> 02:06:48.320 align:start position:0%
replaced with their age peers if they do
 
02:06:50.149 --> 02:06:50.159 align:start position:0%
go back to the public classroom that
 
02:06:51.990 --> 02:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
they had left due to covid
 
02:06:53.589 --> 02:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
i urge you to aggress address these
 
02:06:56.069 --> 02:06:56.079 align:start position:0%
current concerns thank you and i'll take
 
02:06:57.350 --> 02:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much
 
02:06:58.790 --> 02:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
representative are there questions from
 
02:07:01.990 --> 02:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
the committee representative cordelli
 
02:07:03.109 --> 02:07:03.119 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
02:07:05.270 --> 02:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
representative for bringing this forward
 
02:07:08.149 --> 02:07:08.159 align:start position:0%
um just so that we're clear we're
 
02:07:09.910 --> 02:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
talking in your
 
02:07:13.109 --> 02:07:13.119 align:start position:0%
legislation about
 
02:07:13.119 --> 02:07:15.030 align:start position:0%
legislation about
homeschoolers

02:07:15.030 --> 02:07:15.040 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers
 
02:07:15.040 --> 02:07:17.350 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers

02:07:17.350 --> 02:07:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:19.830 --> 02:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
home parents who are homeschooling with
 
02:07:23.430 --> 02:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
an efa account they are a separate
 
02:07:25.910 --> 02:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
attendance category as i understand it
 
02:07:28.390 --> 02:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
is that correct that is correct these
 
02:07:30.310 --> 02:07:30.320 align:start position:0%
are the people who are 193a
 
02:07:32.550 --> 02:07:32.560 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers there was already a method
 
02:07:34.550 --> 02:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
last year with the efa accounts there
 
02:07:37.430 --> 02:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
was a new section of law created for efa
 
02:07:39.510 --> 02:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
students regardless of whether they're
 
02:07:41.589 --> 02:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
educated in a private school
 
02:07:43.350 --> 02:07:43.360 align:start position:0%
at home or any of these other
 
02:07:45.669 --> 02:07:45.679 align:start position:0%
combinations they have an entirely
 
02:07:47.430 --> 02:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
different section of law
 
02:07:49.430 --> 02:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
and unless they gave up the efa they
 
02:07:51.109 --> 02:07:51.119 align:start position:0%
would not touch the law we're looking at
 
02:07:53.270 --> 02:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
today these are the people who do not
 
02:07:54.950 --> 02:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
want the state money
 
02:07:57.270 --> 02:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
and are very happy to do it on their own
 
02:07:59.030 --> 02:07:59.040 align:start position:0%
and are very happy to have a separate
 
02:08:00.950 --> 02:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
section of law
 
02:08:03.510 --> 02:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
02:08:05.270 --> 02:08:05.280 align:start position:0%

honorable
 
02:08:12.390 --> 02:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
senator cling
 
02:08:13.669 --> 02:08:13.679 align:start position:0%
it's been a few years since you've been
 
02:08:26.709 --> 02:08:26.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:29.830 --> 02:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
hit the button there great thanks
 
02:08:31.990 --> 02:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
you can't train a senator i'm sorry
 
02:08:35.750 --> 02:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:37.350 --> 02:08:37.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman members of the
 
02:08:39.350 --> 02:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
committee i know for the last few days
 
02:08:41.270 --> 02:08:41.280 align:start position:0%
you've been dealing a lot with the
 
02:08:43.030 --> 02:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
education freedom account
 
02:08:44.790 --> 02:08:44.800 align:start position:0%
and i just want to help point out that
 
02:08:47.510 --> 02:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
this bill is not about the efa program
 
02:08:49.669 --> 02:08:49.679 align:start position:0%
it instead is specific to homeschool
 
02:08:52.950 --> 02:08:52.960 align:start position:0%
students and it's governed by 193a
 
02:08:55.589 --> 02:08:55.599 align:start position:0%
and as the previous speaker said these
 
02:08:57.030 --> 02:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
are the people that don't want the state
 
02:08:57.040 --> 02:08:58.470 align:start position:0%
are the people that don't want the state
money

02:08:58.470 --> 02:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
money
 
02:09:01.350 --> 02:09:01.360 align:start position:0%
what i'm going to do is i was asked by
 
02:09:04.390 --> 02:09:04.400 align:start position:0%
dr brian ray to read his statement
 
02:09:05.990 --> 02:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
for the benefit of all the people who
 
02:09:08.790 --> 02:09:08.800 align:start position:0%
watch you on on camera
 
02:09:10.950 --> 02:09:10.960 align:start position:0%
i usually watch you on camera myself
 
02:09:13.669 --> 02:09:13.679 align:start position:0%
it's very brief and i'll go fast
 
02:09:15.189 --> 02:09:15.199 align:start position:0%

research institute in salem oregon
 
02:09:45.910 --> 02:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
40 years of research studies by various
 
02:09:48.149 --> 02:09:48.159 align:start position:0%
scholars show that homeschool students
 
02:09:49.750 --> 02:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
typically outperform public school
 
02:09:52.709 --> 02:09:52.719 align:start position:0%
students by 15 to 30 percentile points
 
02:09:54.790 --> 02:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
on standardized academic achievement
 
02:09:54.800 --> 02:09:55.750 align:start position:0%
on standardized academic achievement
tests

02:09:55.750 --> 02:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
tests
 
02:09:57.830 --> 02:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
the majority of research also shows that
 
02:10:00.790 --> 02:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
the home educated or developing socially
 
02:10:02.550 --> 02:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
and emotionally better than the public
 
02:10:04.950 --> 02:10:04.960 align:start position:0%
school and the home school do as well or
 
02:10:06.550 --> 02:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
better than the conventionally schooled
 
02:10:09.990 --> 02:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
in adulthood in various fears of living
 
02:10:12.069 --> 02:10:12.079 align:start position:0%
nevertheless just as some public schools
 
02:10:13.910 --> 02:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
and private school students score below
 
02:10:15.750 --> 02:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
average on achievement test
 
02:10:18.390 --> 02:10:18.400 align:start position:0%
whether that means 10th 20th or 39th
 
02:10:18.400 --> 02:10:19.669 align:start position:0%
whether that means 10th 20th or 39th
percentile

02:10:19.669 --> 02:10:19.679 align:start position:0%
percentile
 
02:10:22.069 --> 02:10:22.079 align:start position:0%
so do some homeschool students current
 
02:10:24.470 --> 02:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
state law states that
 
02:10:25.990 --> 02:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
current law states that a homeschool
 
02:10:28.310 --> 02:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
student must score at or above 40th
 
02:10:28.320 --> 02:10:29.589 align:start position:0%
student must score at or above 40th
percentile

02:10:29.589 --> 02:10:29.599 align:start position:0%
percentile
 
02:10:31.990 --> 02:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
it's crucial to note that at about 39
 
02:10:33.669 --> 02:10:33.679 align:start position:0%
percent of all public schools students
 
02:10:36.069 --> 02:10:36.079 align:start position:0%
score below the 40th percentile on
 
02:10:38.550 --> 02:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
nationally normed achievement tests
 
02:10:41.030 --> 02:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
yes 39 of public school students by
 
02:10:45.189 --> 02:10:45.199 align:start position:0%
definition score below the 40 percentile
 
02:10:47.350 --> 02:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
permit me to explain a few main reasons
 
02:10:49.990 --> 02:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
why the mention and law of any cut off
 
02:10:51.350 --> 02:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
test score
 
02:10:53.589 --> 02:10:53.599 align:start position:0%
with regard to home schooling is wrong
 
02:10:55.510 --> 02:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
first it is discriminatory practice
 
02:10:57.109 --> 02:10:57.119 align:start position:0%
toward homeschooling
 
02:11:00.310 --> 02:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
as a legal private educational opinion
 
02:11:02.310 --> 02:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
to be equitable if there is to be a
 
02:11:04.629 --> 02:11:04.639 align:start position:0%
cutoff score for being free to continue
 
02:11:06.790 --> 02:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
in homeschooling then there should also
 
02:11:09.589 --> 02:11:09.599 align:start position:0%
be the same cut off school score
 
02:11:11.669 --> 02:11:11.679 align:start position:0%
for being allowed to continue in public
 
02:11:13.430 --> 02:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
school and private schools
 
02:11:15.350 --> 02:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether they are religious
 
02:11:17.990 --> 02:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
or secular independent
 
02:11:19.669 --> 02:11:19.679 align:start position:0%
but there is no cutoff score for a
 
02:11:21.270 --> 02:11:21.280 align:start position:0%
student to continue in the public school
 
02:11:23.669 --> 02:11:23.679 align:start position:0%
or in private institutional school
 
02:11:25.589 --> 02:11:25.599 align:start position:0%
neither state law nor public school
 
02:11:27.830 --> 02:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
teachers nor teachers unions are arguing
 
02:11:30.069 --> 02:11:30.079 align:start position:0%
that there should be a cut off score of
 
02:11:31.910 --> 02:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
the 40th percentile for public school
 
02:11:34.470 --> 02:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
students and that 39 percent of public
 
02:11:35.669 --> 02:11:35.679 align:start position:0%
school students
 
02:11:37.350 --> 02:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
should be mandated to attend private
 
02:11:39.350 --> 02:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
schools or homeschooling
 
02:11:41.669 --> 02:11:41.679 align:start position:0%
second there is no sound
 
02:11:41.679 --> 02:11:43.589 align:start position:0%
second there is no sound
pedagogical

02:11:43.589 --> 02:11:43.599 align:start position:0%
pedagogical
 
02:11:46.069 --> 02:11:46.079 align:start position:0%
reason to have different that is lower
 
02:11:47.589 --> 02:11:47.599 align:start position:0%
standards for public schooling and
 
02:11:49.350 --> 02:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
private schooling as compared to private
 
02:11:49.360 --> 02:11:50.790 align:start position:0%
private schooling as compared to private
homeschooling

02:11:50.790 --> 02:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
homeschooling
 
02:11:52.709 --> 02:11:52.719 align:start position:0%
this is especially true in light of the
 
02:11:55.189 --> 02:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
fact that such a large portion of public
 
02:11:57.430 --> 02:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
school students have been found to be
 
02:11:59.109 --> 02:11:59.119 align:start position:0%
below proficient
 
02:12:02.149 --> 02:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
on the national naep testing program
 
02:12:03.990 --> 02:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
and when so many public school students
 
02:12:05.669 --> 02:12:05.679 align:start position:0%
have shown such little educational
 
02:12:08.149 --> 02:12:08.159 align:start position:0%
growth over the past two years
 
02:12:09.669 --> 02:12:09.679 align:start position:0%
third such a cut-off score for
 
02:12:12.229 --> 02:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
homeschooling or any kind of schooling
 
02:12:14.069 --> 02:12:14.079 align:start position:0%
ignores the reality that there will
 
02:12:16.629 --> 02:12:16.639 align:start position:0%
always be a given percent of students
 
02:12:18.550 --> 02:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
whether public schooled private schooled
 
02:12:20.870 --> 02:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
or homeschooled below any given
 
02:12:22.950 --> 02:12:22.960 align:start position:0%
percentile cut-off point
 
02:12:24.870 --> 02:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
the important thing in education is not
 
02:12:27.510 --> 02:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
whether a student is below point x or y
 
02:12:29.270 --> 02:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
on a standardized test
 
02:12:30.709 --> 02:12:30.719 align:start position:0%
but whether the student is making
 
02:12:33.030 --> 02:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate educational progress
 
02:12:35.510 --> 02:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
a homeschool student or a public school
 
02:12:37.669 --> 02:12:37.679 align:start position:0%
a private school student moving from the
 
02:12:40.390 --> 02:12:40.400 align:start position:0%
20th percentile one year to the 27th
 
02:12:40.400 --> 02:12:41.589 align:start position:0%
20th percentile one year to the 27th
percentile

02:12:41.589 --> 02:12:41.599 align:start position:0%
percentile
 
02:12:43.510 --> 02:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
might indicate tremendous growth and
 
02:12:43.520 --> 02:12:44.790 align:start position:0%
might indicate tremendous growth and
learning

02:12:44.790 --> 02:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
learning
 
02:12:47.109 --> 02:12:47.119 align:start position:0%
all educators should know this
 
02:12:49.030 --> 02:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
fourth and finally
 
02:12:50.950 --> 02:12:50.960 align:start position:0%
research shows that the degree of state
 
02:12:53.510 --> 02:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
control and regulation of homeschooling
 
02:12:55.109 --> 02:12:55.119 align:start position:0%
is not related to an academic
 
02:12:55.119 --> 02:12:56.149 align:start position:0%
is not related to an academic
achievement

02:12:56.149 --> 02:12:56.159 align:start position:0%
achievement
 
02:12:58.149 --> 02:12:58.159 align:start position:0%
achievement test scores of home school
 
02:12:59.430 --> 02:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
students in state with higher
 
02:13:01.910 --> 02:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
regulations are the same as states with
 
02:13:03.669 --> 02:13:03.679 align:start position:0%
lesser regulations
 
02:13:05.589 --> 02:13:05.599 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to speak brian
 
02:13:08.470 --> 02:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
ray and mr chairman there is a set of
 
02:13:10.709 --> 02:13:10.719 align:start position:0%
references and i will pass out enough i
 
02:13:13.430 --> 02:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
believe for the whole committee um
 
02:13:15.270 --> 02:13:15.280 align:start position:0%
i take questions but i'm not sure i'm
 
02:13:17.510 --> 02:13:17.520 align:start position:0%

good morning my name is michelle avell
 
02:13:43.990 --> 02:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
and it's a pleasure to be back in the
 
02:13:45.589 --> 02:13:45.599 align:start position:0%
house education committee it's been a
 
02:13:48.229 --> 02:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
while so nice to see you again
 
02:13:50.229 --> 02:13:50.239 align:start position:0%
in the interest of time i'm going to
 
02:13:52.709 --> 02:13:52.719 align:start position:0%
abbreviate my comments i have copies
 
02:13:54.149 --> 02:13:54.159 align:start position:0%
that i'll distribute to the committee
 
02:13:56.709 --> 02:13:56.719 align:start position:0%
afterwards i'll even email them to you
 
02:13:58.790 --> 02:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
so you can see the hyperlinks and check
 
02:14:01.510 --> 02:14:01.520 align:start position:0%

gshe supports 1663 because it addresses

important aspects of home education
 
02:14:30.880 --> 02:14:32.149 align:start position:0%
important aspects of home education
statute

02:14:32.149 --> 02:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
statute
 
02:14:34.310 --> 02:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
it resolves some housekeeping
 
02:14:34.320 --> 02:14:35.830 align:start position:0%
it resolves some housekeeping
inconsistencies

02:14:35.830 --> 02:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies
 
02:14:37.430 --> 02:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
and gives parity to homeschoolers
 
02:14:38.709 --> 02:14:38.719 align:start position:0%
relative to students in other
 
02:14:40.950 --> 02:14:40.960 align:start position:0%
educational programs
 
02:14:43.589 --> 02:14:43.599 align:start position:0%
and i can't emphasize enough
 
02:14:46.790 --> 02:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
this bill impacts unfunded homeschoolers
 
02:14:46.800 --> 02:14:47.750 align:start position:0%
this bill impacts unfunded homeschoolers
students

02:14:47.750 --> 02:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
students
 
02:14:51.510 --> 02:14:51.520 align:start position:0%
that follow 193a not those participating
 
02:14:53.350 --> 02:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
in education freedom accounts that are
 
02:14:56.310 --> 02:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
governed by 194f
 
02:14:57.990 --> 02:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
we need to make that distinction clear
 
02:14:59.910 --> 02:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
because i've heard in other testimonies
 
02:15:03.109 --> 02:15:03.119 align:start position:0%
and discussions a real confusion on that
 
02:15:05.109 --> 02:15:05.119 align:start position:0%
point so these are the unfunded
 
02:15:07.350 --> 02:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
traditional homeschoolers here
 
02:15:09.350 --> 02:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
in the interest of time i'm going to
 
02:15:11.830 --> 02:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
skip significant sections and go right
 
02:15:14.229 --> 02:15:14.239 align:start position:0%
to part four that removes the
 
02:15:16.149 --> 02:15:16.159 align:start position:0%
unequitable academic achievement
 
02:15:18.470 --> 02:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
thresholds and provides protections for
 
02:15:20.390 --> 02:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
home educated students with special
 
02:15:22.470 --> 02:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
education differences
 
02:15:25.270 --> 02:15:25.280 align:start position:0%
currently unfunded homeschooled students
 
02:15:27.430 --> 02:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
are the only educational pathway that
 
02:15:29.030 --> 02:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
has individual student academic
 
02:15:30.790 --> 02:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
achievement requirements written into
 
02:15:31.990 --> 02:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
state law
 
02:15:33.990 --> 02:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
the current home education statute says
 
02:15:36.069 --> 02:15:36.079 align:start position:0%
that a child must show quote progress
 
02:15:39.109 --> 02:15:39.119 align:start position:0%
commensurate with age and ability
 
02:15:41.109 --> 02:15:41.119 align:start position:0%
it further states that if a family uses
 
02:15:42.950 --> 02:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
a standardized test for the annual
 
02:15:44.790 --> 02:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
assessment that the child must achieve a
 
02:15:47.030 --> 02:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
composite score at or above the 40th
 
02:15:49.750 --> 02:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
percentile to demonstrate academic
 
02:15:49.760 --> 02:15:51.669 align:start position:0%

proficiency
 
02:15:54.310 --> 02:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
achievement at or above the 40th
 
02:15:57.430 --> 02:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
percentile means that 39 percent of
 
02:16:00.390 --> 02:16:00.400 align:start position:0%
students fail automatically
 
02:16:02.950 --> 02:16:02.960 align:start position:0%
this standard is unique to unfunded home
 
02:16:04.870 --> 02:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
educated children
 
02:16:06.790 --> 02:16:06.800 align:start position:0%

02:16:41.750 --> 02:16:41.760 align:start position:0%

students in public schools cost an

however the statewide achievement scores
 
02:17:05.830 --> 02:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
indicate generally low proficiency
 
02:17:08.230 --> 02:17:08.240 align:start position:0%

that benchmark was not achieved in my

in addition

support of this bill by changing the

wordage in several phrases throughout
 
02:20:12.630 --> 02:20:12.640 align:start position:0%
the home school law
 
02:20:14.389 --> 02:20:14.399 align:start position:0%
to clarify and make it easier for
 
02:20:16.550 --> 02:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
homeschool families to read the letter
 
02:20:17.830 --> 02:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
of the law and also give us a
 
02:20:20.150 --> 02:20:20.160 align:start position:0%
documentation to present to our school
 
02:20:23.990 --> 02:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:26.790 --> 02:20:26.800 align:start position:0%
a public access to classes that would
 
02:20:28.710 --> 02:20:28.720 align:start position:0%
enrich our students
 
02:20:30.150 --> 02:20:30.160 align:start position:0%
stating that homeschoolers are being
 
02:20:32.150 --> 02:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
held at a higher standard than regular
 
02:20:34.710 --> 02:20:34.720 align:start position:0%
public schools needs to go and
 
02:20:36.309 --> 02:20:36.319 align:start position:0%
learning disabilities need to be held at
 
02:20:38.070 --> 02:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
a level which the children learn with
 
02:20:39.510 --> 02:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
that disability
 
02:20:41.270 --> 02:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
returning students to the public school
 
02:20:42.469 --> 02:20:42.479 align:start position:0%
needs to be
 
02:20:43.910 --> 02:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
that are being discriminated because
 
02:20:45.670 --> 02:20:45.680 align:start position:0%
they are homeschooled either by short or
 
02:20:46.950 --> 02:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
long term
 
02:20:48.309 --> 02:20:48.319 align:start position:0%

not

02:20:51.750 --> 02:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:20:53.190 --> 02:20:53.200 align:start position:0%
on factors that the school feels that
 
02:20:54.630 --> 02:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
they need to be in
 
02:20:57.110 --> 02:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
notifications need to be clear
 
02:20:59.030 --> 02:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
where we're sending them and how we are
 
02:21:00.790 --> 02:21:00.800 align:start position:0%
sending them whether we are beginning or
 
02:21:03.510 --> 02:21:03.520 align:start position:0%

activists all across the state
 
02:21:57.830 --> 02:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
i urge you to support house bill 1663
 
02:21:59.750 --> 02:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
a bill which clarifies the requirements
 
02:22:01.910 --> 02:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
for home educated students
 
02:22:04.070 --> 02:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
and this legislation really does make
 
02:22:06.790 --> 02:22:06.800 align:start position:0%
several very important clarifications
 
02:22:08.950 --> 02:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
so first it ensures that each of the
 
02:22:10.950 --> 02:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
districts shall have a policy in place
 
02:22:12.870 --> 02:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
for home educated students who
 
02:22:14.870 --> 02:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
participate in classes and
 
02:22:14.880 --> 02:22:16.469 align:start position:0%
participate in classes and
extracurriculars

02:22:16.469 --> 02:22:16.479 align:start position:0%
extracurriculars
 
02:22:17.670 --> 02:22:17.680 align:start position:0%
state law
 
02:22:21.110 --> 02:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
already requires that these districts
 
02:22:23.349 --> 02:22:23.359 align:start position:0%
allow these students to participate but
 
02:22:25.110 --> 02:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
there is some confusion among some
 
02:22:27.030 --> 02:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
districts as to what that policy looks
 
02:22:27.040 --> 02:22:27.750 align:start position:0%
districts as to what that policy looks
like

02:22:27.750 --> 02:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
like
 
02:22:29.590 --> 02:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
so this bill would just clarify that and
 
02:22:33.590 --> 02:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
make sure that school educators
 
02:22:35.349 --> 02:22:35.359 align:start position:0%
and staff there would have a clear
 
02:22:35.359 --> 02:22:36.550 align:start position:0%
and staff there would have a clear
understanding

02:22:36.550 --> 02:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
02:22:39.349 --> 02:22:39.359 align:start position:0%
of how that policy works
 
02:22:40.950 --> 02:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
and i think that this bill would really
 
02:22:42.950 --> 02:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
guarantee that students are not left
 
02:22:44.469 --> 02:22:44.479 align:start position:0%
waiting if they're wishing to
 
02:22:45.670 --> 02:22:45.680 align:start position:0%
participate in classes or
 
02:22:47.910 --> 02:22:47.920 align:start position:0%
extracurriculars there was at least one
 
02:22:49.349 --> 02:22:49.359 align:start position:0%
instance over the past year where a
 
02:22:51.510 --> 02:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
district was unclear on how these
 
02:22:53.590 --> 02:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
students were to be integrated
 
02:22:55.910 --> 02:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
and there was time that the student is
 
02:22:58.950 --> 02:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
sitting there waiting to participate
 
02:23:00.870 --> 02:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to kind of clarify that i
 
02:23:03.190 --> 02:23:03.200 align:start position:0%
know firsthand the importance of giving
 
02:23:05.670 --> 02:23:05.680 align:start position:0%
these home educated students access to
 
02:23:08.630 --> 02:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
the classes and the extracurriculars
 
02:23:11.270 --> 02:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
between my two sisters and i we were
 
02:23:13.429 --> 02:23:13.439 align:start position:0%
homeschooled public school private
 
02:23:15.429 --> 02:23:15.439 align:start position:0%
school we did all the different options
 
02:23:17.030 --> 02:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
at one point or another
 
02:23:19.510 --> 02:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
and throughout the time that we were
 
02:23:21.110 --> 02:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
home educated
 
02:23:23.110 --> 02:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
i participated in classes at the local
 
02:23:26.309 --> 02:23:26.319 align:start position:0%
public school i did foreign languages
 
02:23:28.710 --> 02:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
gym art class while my sisters
 
02:23:31.349 --> 02:23:31.359 align:start position:0%
participated in various sports and
 
02:23:31.359 --> 02:23:32.870 align:start position:0%
participated in various sports and
without

02:23:32.870 --> 02:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
without
 
02:23:34.950 --> 02:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to take these classes i
 
02:23:37.349 --> 02:23:37.359 align:start position:0%
think our education would have been
 
02:23:38.630 --> 02:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
a lot different
 
02:23:40.469 --> 02:23:40.479 align:start position:0%
and so i really think it's important
 
02:23:42.630 --> 02:23:42.640 align:start position:0%
that we make sure that we have a policy
 
02:23:44.309 --> 02:23:44.319 align:start position:0%
amongst each district for how these
 
02:23:46.230 --> 02:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
students can participate
 
02:23:48.870 --> 02:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
so next this bill clarifies that home
 
02:23:51.349 --> 02:23:51.359 align:start position:0%
education must be provided coordinated
 
02:23:53.429 --> 02:23:53.439 align:start position:0%
or directed by a parent
 
02:23:55.190 --> 02:23:55.200 align:start position:0%
over the last five to ten years
 
02:23:56.950 --> 02:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
education has really become more
 
02:23:59.190 --> 02:23:59.200 align:start position:0%
unbundled than ever before we're seeing
 
02:24:02.309 --> 02:24:02.319 align:start position:0%
parents take advantage of opportunities
 
02:24:03.990 --> 02:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
that we haven't seen before
 
02:24:05.670 --> 02:24:05.680 align:start position:0%
and so this legislation makes it clear
 
02:24:07.190 --> 02:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
that parents don't need to be the only
 
02:24:09.830 --> 02:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
educator in their child's education
 
02:24:12.230 --> 02:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
and then just lastly this bill makes
 
02:24:14.950 --> 02:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
certain that home educated students with
 
02:24:17.429 --> 02:24:17.439 align:start position:0%
disabilities are evaluated with the same
 
02:24:19.429 --> 02:24:19.439 align:start position:0%
standards as children with similar
 
02:24:21.110 --> 02:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
disabilities that are in a traditional
 
02:24:22.710 --> 02:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
school setting
 
02:24:24.309 --> 02:24:24.319 align:start position:0%
this is a straightforward and reasonable
 
02:24:25.910 --> 02:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
expectation that i think we can all
 
02:24:27.590 --> 02:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
agree makes sense
 
02:24:29.270 --> 02:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
these students should absolutely not be
 
02:24:31.110 --> 02:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
held to a higher level of assessment
 
02:24:32.870 --> 02:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
than a student in a more traditional
 
02:24:34.950 --> 02:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
setting so it's for these reasons that
 
02:24:36.870 --> 02:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
we ask you to support the passage of
 
02:24:38.309 --> 02:24:38.319 align:start position:0%
this legislation
 
02:24:39.910 --> 02:24:39.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:24:43.349 --> 02:24:43.359 align:start position:0%
are there questions from the committee
 
02:24:46.630 --> 02:24:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:48.230 --> 02:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
so again i'm not quite as familiar with
 
02:24:49.349 --> 02:24:49.359 align:start position:0%
this as some people and i've been
 
02:24:51.190 --> 02:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
sitting here reading it and what i see
 
02:24:52.710 --> 02:24:52.720 align:start position:0%
is that there's a choice among parents
 
02:24:54.710 --> 02:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
we are not mandating that they take a
 
02:24:56.230 --> 02:24:56.240 align:start position:0%
standardized test and score forty
 
02:24:59.030 --> 02:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
percent there's a choice so if a parent
 
02:25:00.469 --> 02:25:00.479 align:start position:0%
is concerned about the forty percent
 
02:25:01.910 --> 02:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
would they have a choice of using an
 
02:25:03.910 --> 02:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
alternative method to determine
 
02:25:03.920 --> 02:25:05.349 align:start position:0%
alternative method to determine
competency

02:25:05.349 --> 02:25:05.359 align:start position:0%
competency
 
02:25:07.510 --> 02:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question yes there
 
02:25:09.830 --> 02:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
is a choice a lot of parents do like to
 
02:25:11.590 --> 02:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
use the standardized assessments because
 
02:25:12.950 --> 02:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
it's easier for them to track their
 
02:25:14.469 --> 02:25:14.479 align:start position:0%
students progress over the course of the
 
02:25:19.590 --> 02:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:21.670 --> 02:25:21.680 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
02:25:24.710 --> 02:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:25:28.870 --> 02:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
we have a card from j.r hole
 
02:25:31.910 --> 02:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
previously representative whole
 
02:25:38.070 --> 02:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:39.830 --> 02:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
at one time sat on the education
 
02:25:39.840 --> 02:25:45.110 align:start position:0%
at one time sat on the education
committee

02:25:45.110 --> 02:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:46.070 --> 02:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
is it good
 
02:25:46.080 --> 02:25:46.870 align:start position:0%

at manchester community
 
02:26:31.439 --> 02:26:33.030 align:start position:0%
at manchester community
and

02:26:33.030 --> 02:26:33.040 align:start position:0%

clearly homeschool parents can do a good
 
02:26:35.120 --> 02:26:36.070 align:start position:0%
clearly homeschool parents can do a good
job

02:26:36.070 --> 02:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
job
 
02:26:37.590 --> 02:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
section one and two are great of this
 
02:26:40.550 --> 02:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
bill i love that um i have i echo the
 
02:26:43.190 --> 02:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
concerns about the 40th percentile right
 
02:26:44.870 --> 02:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
because the 40th percentile as someone
 
02:26:47.349 --> 02:26:47.359 align:start position:0%
else pointed out means 39 of the
 
02:26:50.309 --> 02:26:50.319 align:start position:0%
students in in this average distribution
 
02:26:52.070 --> 02:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
would be below that level
 
02:26:52.080 --> 02:26:53.510 align:start position:0%
would be below that level
um

02:26:53.510 --> 02:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:55.349 --> 02:26:55.359 align:start position:0%
statistically speaking that's that's not
 
02:26:58.070 --> 02:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
a good percentage and and not everybody
 
02:27:00.070 --> 02:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
is going to be capable at that level
 
02:27:01.670 --> 02:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
just because of their
 
02:27:01.680 --> 02:27:02.550 align:start position:0%
just because of their
their

02:27:02.550 --> 02:27:02.560 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:27:04.469 --> 02:27:04.479 align:start position:0%
natural abilities
 
02:27:04.479 --> 02:27:05.270 align:start position:0%
natural abilities
so

02:27:05.270 --> 02:27:05.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:27:06.950 --> 02:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
um i understand there may be an
 
02:27:08.950 --> 02:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
amendment um coming forward at some
 
02:27:11.590 --> 02:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
point um it's the representative leon
 
02:27:13.830 --> 02:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
amendment i i just briefly read through
 
02:27:15.990 --> 02:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
it just now i saw no issues with that
 
02:27:17.270 --> 02:27:17.280 align:start position:0%
amendment i am in support of those
 
02:27:17.280 --> 02:27:19.429 align:start position:0%
amendment i am in support of those
changes

02:27:19.429 --> 02:27:19.439 align:start position:0%
changes
 
02:27:19.439 --> 02:27:20.389 align:start position:0%
changes
um

02:27:20.389 --> 02:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:23.670 --> 02:27:23.680 align:start position:0%
i am concerned about the fact that um as
 
02:27:25.270 --> 02:27:25.280 align:start position:0%
parents move from district to district
 
02:27:28.070 --> 02:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
the notification issues get pretty ugly
 
02:27:29.590 --> 02:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
and squirrely
 
02:27:31.670 --> 02:27:31.680 align:start position:0%
um if you've notified your prior one now
 
02:27:33.990 --> 02:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
you gotta notify your your new one at
 
02:27:35.990 --> 02:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
one point we were looking at whether you
 
02:27:38.550 --> 02:27:38.560 align:start position:0%
even need some level of notification um
 
02:27:40.710 --> 02:27:40.720 align:start position:0%
because if you notify the town and then
 
02:27:42.710 --> 02:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
you move to another town right there it
 
02:27:44.950 --> 02:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
just gets ugly um at some point i'm not
 
02:27:47.030 --> 02:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
sure that notification is necessary um
 
02:27:48.630 --> 02:27:48.640 align:start position:0%
but that's that's not this bill and
 
02:27:50.630 --> 02:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
that's for another day
 
02:27:52.469 --> 02:27:52.479 align:start position:0%
okay i would ask that you would support
 
02:27:53.910 --> 02:27:53.920 align:start position:0%
it with the changes that were proposed
 
02:27:56.469 --> 02:27:56.479 align:start position:0%
by representative leon and
 
02:27:58.950 --> 02:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
um that ends my tone testimony i'll ask
 
02:28:00.469 --> 02:28:00.479 align:start position:0%

02:28:01.670 --> 02:28:01.680 align:start position:0%

02:28:04.150 --> 02:28:04.160 align:start position:0%

amendment has been presented okay we
 
02:28:16.870 --> 02:28:16.880 align:start position:0%

six

02:32:03.910 --> 02:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
six
 
02:32:06.070 --> 02:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
and i'm a special needs homeschool mom
 
02:32:08.550 --> 02:32:08.560 align:start position:0%
and i'm here testifying because
 
02:32:12.309 --> 02:32:12.319 align:start position:0%
all of this makes me an expert
 
02:32:17.349 --> 02:32:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:18.710 --> 02:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
now i fully realize that there are
 
02:32:20.630 --> 02:32:20.640 align:start position:0%
people who probably signed in on this
 
02:32:23.830 --> 02:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
bill who might be here today to testify
 
02:32:26.870 --> 02:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
as well who not only are not home
 
02:32:28.950 --> 02:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
schoolers but probably don't know the
 
02:32:31.270 --> 02:32:31.280 align:start position:0%
first thing about homeschooling or the
 
02:32:33.990 --> 02:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
home school law in new hampshire
 
02:32:36.389 --> 02:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
there are organizations that saw home
 
02:32:39.030 --> 02:32:39.040 align:start position:0%
education committee and home education
 
02:32:43.830 --> 02:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:47.190 --> 02:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
probably without even reading
 
02:32:49.830 --> 02:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:51.830 --> 02:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
i'm not a public school parent i'm not
 
02:32:53.670 --> 02:32:53.680 align:start position:0%
part of a teacher's union i'm not an
 
02:32:57.429 --> 02:32:57.439 align:start position:0%
educational lobbyist i am an expert
 
02:32:59.190 --> 02:32:59.200 align:start position:0%
in home education in new hampshire and
 
02:33:01.910 --> 02:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
i've spent years earning the privilege
 
02:33:03.990 --> 02:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
to speak here today on behalf of the
 
02:33:06.630 --> 02:33:06.640 align:start position:0%
homeschool community
 
02:33:09.110 --> 02:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
a brief explanation of this bill should
 
02:33:11.349 --> 02:33:11.359 align:start position:0%
clear up any misgivings one might have
 
02:33:13.389 --> 02:33:13.399 align:start position:0%
as to whether or not
 
02:33:17.030 --> 02:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
hb1663 is needed necessary
 
02:33:19.190 --> 02:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
or even relevant
 
02:33:22.070 --> 02:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
we have five objectives in this bill
 
02:33:24.469 --> 02:33:24.479 align:start position:0%
this bill requires school boards to
 
02:33:27.110 --> 02:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
adopt an equal access policy it's a
 
02:33:29.590 --> 02:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
simple change of the word may
 
02:33:31.270 --> 02:33:31.280 align:start position:0%
to shall
 
02:33:32.950 --> 02:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
i want to make sure that you understand
 
02:33:35.270 --> 02:33:35.280 align:start position:0%
what equal access means and what it
 
02:33:37.429 --> 02:33:37.439 align:start position:0%
means to this bill
 
02:33:39.349 --> 02:33:39.359 align:start position:0%
the current law states that home
 
02:33:40.950 --> 02:33:40.960 align:start position:0%
educated students have the right to
 
02:33:42.870 --> 02:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
curricular and co-curricular activities
 
02:33:45.270 --> 02:33:45.280 align:start position:0%
at their local sau
 
02:33:46.830 --> 02:33:46.840 align:start position:0%
public schools may not treat
 
02:33:49.110 --> 02:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers any differently than
 
02:33:51.349 --> 02:33:51.359 align:start position:0%
enrolled students when signing up for
 
02:33:54.150 --> 02:33:54.160 align:start position:0%
classes programs prom
 
02:33:56.790 --> 02:33:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:59.910 --> 02:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
this is current law
 
02:34:02.230 --> 02:34:02.240 align:start position:0%
homeschool families pay taxes just like
 
02:34:03.750 --> 02:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
public school families and this is a
 
02:34:06.150 --> 02:34:06.160 align:start position:0%
legal right in new hampshire there are
 
02:34:08.230 --> 02:34:08.240 align:start position:0%
dozens at least of public school
 
02:34:10.870 --> 02:34:10.880 align:start position:0%
districts that either won have no
 
02:34:13.750 --> 02:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
written guidelines whatsoever or two
 
02:34:16.230 --> 02:34:16.240 align:start position:0%
have extremely outdated and often
 
02:34:19.510 --> 02:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
therefore illegal guidelines
 
02:34:21.030 --> 02:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
did you hear about that homeschool
 
02:34:22.950 --> 02:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
advocate who challenged the rochester
 
02:34:24.710 --> 02:34:24.720 align:start position:0%
school district
 
02:34:27.270 --> 02:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
ultimately resulting in the doe taking
 
02:34:28.870 --> 02:34:28.880 align:start position:0%
legal action against the district for
 
02:34:31.510 --> 02:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
discriminating against homeschoolers
 
02:34:34.630 --> 02:34:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:35.990 --> 02:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
ask me to tell you the whole story
 
02:34:37.910 --> 02:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
another time
 
02:34:41.110 --> 02:34:41.120 align:start position:0%
it's exactly why this one word change is
 
02:34:41.120 --> 02:34:43.030 align:start position:0%
it's exactly why this one word change is
needed

02:34:43.030 --> 02:34:43.040 align:start position:0%
needed
 
02:34:45.590 --> 02:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
since i sacrifice my time to educate and
 
02:34:47.990 --> 02:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
correct public school districts
 
02:34:50.070 --> 02:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
regarding their non-existent or outdated
 
02:34:52.389 --> 02:34:52.399 align:start position:0%
policies i think i know what i'm talking
 
02:34:54.550 --> 02:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
about when i say
 
02:34:58.950 --> 02:34:58.960 align:start position:0%
rochester's was from 1996 their policy
 
02:35:01.349 --> 02:35:01.359 align:start position:0%
the law needs to be updated by changing
 
02:35:04.150 --> 02:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
the word made to shall
 
02:35:05.990 --> 02:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
number two removes language that could
 
02:35:08.550 --> 02:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
imply home education needs approval by a
 
02:35:11.429 --> 02:35:11.439 align:start position:0%
participating agency
 
02:35:13.270 --> 02:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
parents direct
 
02:35:16.389 --> 02:35:16.399 align:start position:0%
their child's home education period
 
02:35:18.389 --> 02:35:18.399 align:start position:0%
by adding the language coordinated or
 
02:35:21.910 --> 02:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
directed by for his or her
 
02:35:23.349 --> 02:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
own child the law would make it
 
02:35:25.910 --> 02:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
explicitly clear that it's parent
 
02:35:25.920 --> 02:35:27.349 align:start position:0%
explicitly clear that it's parent
directed

02:35:27.349 --> 02:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
directed
 
02:35:29.990 --> 02:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
and inclusive of both genders it only
 
02:35:32.550 --> 02:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:35.110 --> 02:35:35.120 align:start position:0%
the second part unless the provider is
 
02:35:36.790 --> 02:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
as otherwise agreed upon by the
 
02:35:38.950 --> 02:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate parties named in paragraph
 
02:35:41.190 --> 02:35:41.200 align:start position:0%
two what
 
02:35:41.200 --> 02:35:42.309 align:start position:0%
two what
no

02:35:42.309 --> 02:35:42.319 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:35:44.070 --> 02:35:44.080 align:start position:0%
that part needs to go there's no other
 
02:35:46.389 --> 02:35:46.399 align:start position:0%
appropriate parties
 
02:35:48.710 --> 02:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
to agree on anything the participating
 
02:35:51.429 --> 02:35:51.439 align:start position:0%
agency does not have this power legally
 
02:35:54.389 --> 02:35:54.399 align:start position:0%
and the law should reflect that
 
02:35:55.590 --> 02:35:55.600 align:start position:0%
number three
 
02:35:57.910 --> 02:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
eliminates inconsistencies regarding who
 
02:35:59.990 --> 02:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
to notify and when this is a long
 
02:36:02.389 --> 02:36:02.399 align:start position:0%
overdue addition
 
02:36:04.550 --> 02:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
i'm asked regularly
 
02:36:06.550 --> 02:36:06.560 align:start position:0%
across all media groups
 
02:36:07.750 --> 02:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
in person
 
02:36:09.030 --> 02:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
on the street
 
02:36:11.030 --> 02:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
in line for coffee
 
02:36:15.030 --> 02:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
exactly the questions that this edition
 
02:36:15.040 --> 02:36:17.349 align:start position:0%
exactly the questions that this edition
answers

02:36:17.349 --> 02:36:17.359 align:start position:0%
answers
 
02:36:20.230 --> 02:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
notifying agencies okay we have options
 
02:36:22.389 --> 02:36:22.399 align:start position:0%
participating agency a private school
 
02:36:24.469 --> 02:36:24.479 align:start position:0%
acting in that capacity the department
 
02:36:29.590 --> 02:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:32.309 --> 02:36:32.319 align:start position:0%
notifying agencies need to know if a
 
02:36:34.710 --> 02:36:34.720 align:start position:0%
homeschool child moves out of state if
 
02:36:36.790 --> 02:36:36.800 align:start position:0%
they move to a different district this
 
02:36:39.830 --> 02:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
is a simple and clear change to the
 
02:36:43.510 --> 02:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
language making it consistent
 
02:36:46.070 --> 02:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
number four removes academic performance
 
02:36:48.469 --> 02:36:48.479 align:start position:0%
thresholds and provides protections
 
02:36:51.750 --> 02:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
for home educated students with special
 
02:36:53.910 --> 02:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
ed differences
 
02:36:57.270 --> 02:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
this part is my jam
 
02:37:01.750 --> 02:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
this part is why i really
 
02:37:03.030 --> 02:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
i'm here
 
02:37:05.429 --> 02:37:05.439 align:start position:0%
brought my kids
 
02:37:06.469 --> 02:37:06.479 align:start position:0%
didn't bring them in person you're
 
02:37:06.479 --> 02:37:11.429 align:start position:0%
didn't bring them in person you're
welcome

02:37:11.429 --> 02:37:11.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:13.190 --> 02:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers are the only educational
 
02:37:13.200 --> 02:37:14.790 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers are the only educational
pathway

02:37:14.790 --> 02:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
pathway
 
02:37:17.110 --> 02:37:17.120 align:start position:0%
that have an individual academic
 
02:37:20.150 --> 02:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
achievement requirement in statute
 
02:37:21.830 --> 02:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
even though they're not supported by tax
 
02:37:21.840 --> 02:37:23.590 align:start position:0%
even though they're not supported by tax
dollars

02:37:23.590 --> 02:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:37:25.910 --> 02:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
this is mind-blowing okay
 
02:37:27.590 --> 02:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
allow me to give you a quick example how
 
02:37:29.670 --> 02:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
to illustrate this so
 
02:37:31.510 --> 02:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
number one it's unfair number two it's
 
02:37:35.030 --> 02:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
unjust this portion of the law
 
02:37:36.630 --> 02:37:36.640 align:start position:0%
so we're gonna talk about donuts let's
 
02:37:39.270 --> 02:37:39.280 align:start position:0%
say three kids get hired to mcdonald's
 
02:37:41.750 --> 02:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
the boss tells all three kids they must
 
02:37:45.110 --> 02:37:45.120 align:start position:0%
each make at least 40 donuts per shift
 
02:37:48.070 --> 02:37:48.080 align:start position:0%
the first kid makes 63 but the boss
 
02:37:49.349 --> 02:37:49.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't care
 
02:37:50.950 --> 02:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
he didn't even ask how many they made
 
02:37:53.349 --> 02:37:53.359 align:start position:0%
the second kid makes 27 and the boss
 
02:37:55.750 --> 02:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
didn't ask that kid either the third kid
 
02:37:57.750 --> 02:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
makes 13.
 
02:37:59.750 --> 02:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
the boss asked this kid how many did you
 
02:37:59.760 --> 02:38:00.469 align:start position:0%
the boss asked this kid how many did you
make

02:38:00.469 --> 02:38:00.479 align:start position:0%
make
 
02:38:02.790 --> 02:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
and then fires that kid for not making
 
02:38:05.110 --> 02:38:05.120 align:start position:0%
at least 40 donuts
 
02:38:07.910 --> 02:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
is this fair is this just of course this
 
02:38:11.590 --> 02:38:11.600 align:start position:0%
is a silly example about donuts and it's
 
02:38:13.750 --> 02:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
easy to see why treating three kids
 
02:38:16.710 --> 02:38:16.720 align:start position:0%
differently is unfair
 
02:38:18.790 --> 02:38:18.800 align:start position:0%
it's easy to see that it's unjust to
 
02:38:21.429 --> 02:38:21.439 align:start position:0%
fire the one kid if the boss didn't even
 
02:38:24.389 --> 02:38:24.399 align:start position:0%
care about what the other kids made
 
02:38:26.309 --> 02:38:26.319 align:start position:0%
now imagine this the third kid has
 
02:38:28.389 --> 02:38:28.399 align:start position:0%
severe dyslexia and couldn't read the
 
02:38:28.399 --> 02:38:31.349 align:start position:0%
severe dyslexia and couldn't read the
recipe

02:38:31.349 --> 02:38:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:33.110 --> 02:38:33.120 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire homeschooled students
 
02:38:34.790 --> 02:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
have the requirement of urine
 
02:38:34.800 --> 02:38:36.389 align:start position:0%
have the requirement of urine
assessments

02:38:36.389 --> 02:38:36.399 align:start position:0%
assessments
 
02:38:39.110 --> 02:38:39.120 align:start position:0%
none of the tweaks in this bill changes
 
02:38:39.120 --> 02:38:40.389 align:start position:0%
none of the tweaks in this bill changes
that

02:38:40.389 --> 02:38:40.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:38:42.070 --> 02:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
parents typically choose one of two
 
02:38:44.230 --> 02:38:44.240 align:start position:0%
options standardized testing or
 
02:38:47.190 --> 02:38:47.200 align:start position:0%
portfolio review parents choose which
 
02:38:49.510 --> 02:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
standardized test to administer who to
 
02:38:51.830 --> 02:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
hire as a certified teacher
 
02:38:54.309 --> 02:38:54.319 align:start position:0%
to review the child's portfolio if a
 
02:38:56.790 --> 02:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
parent chooses a standardized test the
 
02:38:58.550 --> 02:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
student must achieve at least 40
 
02:39:00.469 --> 02:39:00.479 align:start position:0%
percentile this is written in the home
 
02:39:01.670 --> 02:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
school law
 
02:39:03.429 --> 02:39:03.439 align:start position:0%
it's not written in the law for public
 
02:39:05.270 --> 02:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
school students
 
02:39:07.349 --> 02:39:07.359 align:start position:0%
not for private school students
 
02:39:11.110 --> 02:39:11.120 align:start position:0%
not for funded efa homeschool students
 
02:39:13.349 --> 02:39:13.359 align:start position:0%
not for prendopods
 
02:39:15.270 --> 02:39:15.280 align:start position:0%
in fact homeschoolers are the only
 
02:39:16.950 --> 02:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
educational pathway that has this
 
02:39:19.030 --> 02:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
academic achievement requirement but
 
02:39:21.030 --> 02:39:21.040 align:start position:0%
we're not funded by tax dollars and it's
 
02:39:22.790 --> 02:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
a mystery
 
02:39:26.070 --> 02:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
why would unfunded traditional rsa 193a
 
02:39:27.590 --> 02:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers be held to a higher
 
02:39:29.110 --> 02:39:29.120 align:start position:0%
standard than any other educational
 
02:39:29.120 --> 02:39:31.190 align:start position:0%
standard than any other educational
option

02:39:31.190 --> 02:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
option
 
02:39:33.750 --> 02:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
but this portion of statute it needs to
 
02:39:37.030 --> 02:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
go it's unfair and it is unjust and just
 
02:39:38.870 --> 02:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
like my donut example
 
02:39:42.150 --> 02:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
it is unfair and unjust to treat my kids
 
02:39:44.150 --> 02:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
different than the public school
 
02:39:44.160 --> 02:39:46.790 align:start position:0%
different than the public school
children

02:39:46.790 --> 02:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:49.510 --> 02:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
it's discrimination
 
02:39:51.910 --> 02:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
children like mine with special needs
 
02:39:53.590 --> 02:39:53.600 align:start position:0%
learning disabilities and those who need
 
02:39:56.550 --> 02:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
accommodations or modifications are not
 
02:39:59.510 --> 02:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
able to be in compliance with this
 
02:40:01.750 --> 02:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
portion of the law if i choose a
 
02:40:03.750 --> 02:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
standardized test for my child's
 
02:40:05.270 --> 02:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
year-end assessment
 
02:40:06.950 --> 02:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
i could speak on this point for hours
 
02:40:08.790 --> 02:40:08.800 align:start position:0%
since time is short
 
02:40:10.469 --> 02:40:10.479 align:start position:0%
and as an expert in special needs
 
02:40:13.910 --> 02:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
homeschooling i will say this
 
02:40:15.590 --> 02:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
special ed homeschoolers should have
 
02:40:19.110 --> 02:40:19.120 align:start position:0%
their disability expressly considered in
 
02:40:21.190 --> 02:40:21.200 align:start position:0%
their annual assessment this bill
 
02:40:24.630 --> 02:40:24.640 align:start position:0%
accomplishes that my last point is that
 
02:40:26.790 --> 02:40:26.800 align:start position:0%
currently public schools use arbitrary
 
02:40:29.030 --> 02:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
and suggest subjective means to
 
02:40:30.230 --> 02:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
determine the placement for
 
02:40:30.240 --> 02:40:32.150 align:start position:0%
determine the placement for
homeschoolers

02:40:32.150 --> 02:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers
 
02:40:35.190 --> 02:40:35.200 align:start position:0%
wishing to enroll re-enroll
 
02:40:37.110 --> 02:40:37.120 align:start position:0%
after coming from a home education
 
02:40:37.120 --> 02:40:38.630 align:start position:0%
after coming from a home education
pathway

02:40:38.630 --> 02:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
pathway
 
02:40:41.590 --> 02:40:41.600 align:start position:0%
we've stuck it out with hundreds of
 
02:40:44.309 --> 02:40:44.319 align:start position:0%
families who for whatever reason decided
 
02:40:46.630 --> 02:40:46.640 align:start position:0%
to temporarily homeschool their children
 
02:40:48.870 --> 02:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
so as some of these families did decide
 
02:40:51.910 --> 02:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
to re-enroll in public school
 
02:40:54.950 --> 02:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
some of them were met with resistance
 
02:40:57.190 --> 02:40:57.200 align:start position:0%
some of them were met
 
02:40:57.200 --> 02:40:59.269 align:start position:0%
some of them were met
with

02:40:59.269 --> 02:40:59.279 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:41:01.429 --> 02:41:01.439 align:start position:0%
quite frankly opposition and treated
 
02:41:03.110 --> 02:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
differently than kids who were
 
02:41:05.349 --> 02:41:05.359 align:start position:0%
re-enrolling who were not coming from a
 
02:41:08.790 --> 02:41:08.800 align:start position:0%
homeschooling traditional rsa 193a
 
02:41:11.910 --> 02:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
pathway so instead of placement in
 
02:41:13.830 --> 02:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
elementary and middle school by agent
 
02:41:15.750 --> 02:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
address which is
 
02:41:15.760 --> 02:41:16.870 align:start position:0%
address which is
typical

02:41:16.870 --> 02:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
typical
 
02:41:19.030 --> 02:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
they were asked to provide portfolios
 
02:41:21.510 --> 02:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
which we must keep as part of our
 
02:41:23.670 --> 02:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
home education program and year-end
 
02:41:23.680 --> 02:41:24.870 align:start position:0%
home education program and year-end
assessments

02:41:24.870 --> 02:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
assessments
 
02:41:24.880 --> 02:41:25.990 align:start position:0%
assessments
so

02:41:25.990 --> 02:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:41:28.389 --> 02:41:28.399 align:start position:0%
these children were asked for
 
02:41:30.870 --> 02:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
for proof of their education no other
 
02:41:32.550 --> 02:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
students are asked for that in
 
02:41:34.070 --> 02:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
elementary and middle school they're
 
02:41:35.910 --> 02:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
assigned their classroom by age and
 
02:41:35.920 --> 02:41:36.950 align:start position:0%
assigned their classroom by age and
address

02:41:36.950 --> 02:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
address
 
02:41:39.590 --> 02:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
so this bill clearly states a
 
02:41:41.750 --> 02:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination policy if home school
 
02:41:44.790 --> 02:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
students re-enroll in public school
 
02:41:46.790 --> 02:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
so these five main points of the bill
 
02:41:49.110 --> 02:41:49.120 align:start position:0%
are important they're long past due and
 
02:41:51.910 --> 02:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
there's nothing of concern for taxpayers
 
02:41:54.230 --> 02:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
let me say that again nothing of concern
 
02:41:57.190 --> 02:41:57.200 align:start position:0%
for taxpayers there's nothing to object
 
02:41:59.990 --> 02:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
to the fact that representative lan had
 
02:42:02.630 --> 02:42:02.640 align:start position:0%
taken the time to craft this legislation
 
02:42:04.309 --> 02:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
points to the need for your ought to
 
02:42:05.910 --> 02:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
pass a vote
 
02:42:07.910 --> 02:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
she's also a homeschool mom
 
02:42:09.590 --> 02:42:09.600 align:start position:0%
and understands the importance of
 
02:42:11.750 --> 02:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
clearly updating this statute to reflect
 
02:42:11.760 --> 02:42:13.030 align:start position:0%
clearly updating this statute to reflect
consistent

02:42:13.030 --> 02:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
consistent
 
02:42:16.950 --> 02:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
equitable treatment under the law
 
02:42:19.429 --> 02:42:19.439 align:start position:0%
in closing i'd like to thank you members

02:42:30.790 --> 02:42:30.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much amanda are there
 
02:42:33.750 --> 02:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
questions representative cordelli

thank you thank you mr chairman and
 
02:42:37.910 --> 02:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here today um thank
 
02:42:41.110 --> 02:42:41.120 align:start position:0%
everybody for being here today
 
02:42:43.750 --> 02:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
we've had a lot of discussion
 
02:42:47.910 --> 02:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
recently especially about federal idea
 
02:42:47.920 --> 02:42:49.429 align:start position:0%
recently especially about federal idea
law

02:42:49.429 --> 02:42:49.439 align:start position:0%
law
 
02:42:52.070 --> 02:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
and the fact that
 
02:42:52.080 --> 02:42:53.190 align:start position:0%
and the fact that
whether

02:42:53.190 --> 02:42:53.200 align:start position:0%
whether
 
02:42:57.030 --> 02:42:57.040 align:start position:0%
someone leaving a public school
 
02:42:58.710 --> 02:42:58.720 align:start position:0%
might lose
 
02:43:01.030 --> 02:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
the ability for services provided and
 
02:43:04.870 --> 02:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
mandated under idea law
 
02:43:06.550 --> 02:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
as a homeschool
 
02:43:11.510 --> 02:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
mom you are not covered by idea
 
02:43:14.469 --> 02:43:14.479 align:start position:0%
is it i take it it is possible
 
02:43:14.479 --> 02:43:15.510 align:start position:0%
is it i take it it is possible
for

02:43:15.510 --> 02:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:43:18.630 --> 02:43:18.640 align:start position:0%
a mother of a child
 
02:43:22.389 --> 02:43:22.399 align:start position:0%
with needs to get the services that you
 
02:43:24.630 --> 02:43:24.640 align:start position:0%
feel are necessary for your child
 
02:43:28.469 --> 02:43:28.479 align:start position:0%
um without the benefit of federal idea
 
02:43:31.990 --> 02:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
law is that correct and are there many
 
02:43:34.550 --> 02:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
parents of special needs children who
 
02:43:37.510 --> 02:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
are homeschooling yes absolutely
 
02:43:39.990 --> 02:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
and we are one of the
 
02:43:42.550 --> 02:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
um that this population has been growing
 
02:43:44.710 --> 02:43:44.720 align:start position:0%
especially during the pandemic kids who
 
02:43:46.469 --> 02:43:46.479 align:start position:0%
are in a public school setting their
 
02:43:48.710 --> 02:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
needs were not being met due to the
 
02:43:51.750 --> 02:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
nature of the mess that it was so these
 
02:43:53.750 --> 02:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
kids were not being supported their ieps
 
02:43:55.990 --> 02:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
their 504 plans were not being followed
 
02:43:57.990 --> 02:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
either lack of staff
 
02:44:02.230 --> 02:44:02.240 align:start position:0%
i mean we know so we had a surge of
 
02:44:04.389 --> 02:44:04.399 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers period
 
02:44:07.349 --> 02:44:07.359 align:start position:0%
but that specific population is growing
 
02:44:08.710 --> 02:44:08.720 align:start position:0%
and that's not just a new hampshire
 
02:44:13.269 --> 02:44:13.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:14.630 --> 02:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
my son
 
02:44:17.269 --> 02:44:17.279 align:start position:0%
um he's now 11 and he has a list of
 
02:44:19.910 --> 02:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
diagnosis and he has never been outside
 
02:44:22.550 --> 02:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
of my care so he's never been educated
 
02:44:25.670 --> 02:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
outside of my home or underneath my
 
02:44:25.680 --> 02:44:26.790 align:start position:0%
outside of my home or underneath my
direction

02:44:26.790 --> 02:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
direction
 
02:44:29.750 --> 02:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
and my son is thriving
 
02:44:31.590 --> 02:44:31.600 align:start position:0%
he is safe
 
02:44:34.710 --> 02:44:34.720 align:start position:0%
spiritually he is safe academically
 
02:44:37.190 --> 02:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
he's safe
 
02:44:37.200 --> 02:44:39.110 align:start position:0%
he's safe
emotionally

02:44:39.110 --> 02:44:39.120 align:start position:0%
emotionally
 
02:44:42.630 --> 02:44:42.640 align:start position:0%
in my care so there are many many
 
02:44:44.710 --> 02:44:44.720 align:start position:0%
resources available to all homeschool
 
02:44:46.950 --> 02:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
families but those that are particular
 
02:44:46.960 --> 02:44:47.830 align:start position:0%
families but those that are particular
to

02:44:47.830 --> 02:44:47.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:44:49.429 --> 02:44:49.439 align:start position:0%
special needs homeschoolers and this is
 
02:44:51.510 --> 02:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
again part of what i do is provide this
 
02:44:53.190 --> 02:44:53.200 align:start position:0%
list to people
 
02:44:55.830 --> 02:44:55.840 align:start position:0%
at home therapies most of us turn to
 
02:44:57.510 --> 02:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
private therapies through private
 
02:44:57.520 --> 02:44:58.630 align:start position:0%
private therapies through private
insurance

02:44:58.630 --> 02:44:58.640 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
02:44:58.640 --> 02:44:59.590 align:start position:0%
insurance
which

02:44:59.590 --> 02:44:59.600 align:start position:0%
which
 
02:45:02.389 --> 02:45:02.399 align:start position:0%
tend to be a better fit for our children
 
02:45:03.830 --> 02:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
because in a
 
02:45:06.070 --> 02:45:06.080 align:start position:0%
home educated child is not in a public
 
02:45:08.150 --> 02:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
school setting we don't need them to
 
02:45:11.349 --> 02:45:11.359 align:start position:0%
perform and to stay within the
 
02:45:14.070 --> 02:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
the box so to speak of a public school
 
02:45:16.469 --> 02:45:16.479 align:start position:0%
setting so private
 
02:45:18.630 --> 02:45:18.640 align:start position:0%
private therapies
 
02:45:20.630 --> 02:45:20.640 align:start position:0%
are a better fit usually for our family
 
02:45:23.030 --> 02:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
so there are scholarships there are
 
02:45:23.040 --> 02:45:24.469 align:start position:0%
so there are scholarships there are
grants

02:45:24.469 --> 02:45:24.479 align:start position:0%
grants
 
02:45:24.479 --> 02:45:26.230 align:start position:0%
grants
there's

02:45:26.230 --> 02:45:26.240 align:start position:0%
there's
 
02:45:28.070 --> 02:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
there's a whole big world out there of
 
02:45:28.080 --> 02:45:29.269 align:start position:0%
there's a whole big world out there of
curriculum

02:45:29.269 --> 02:45:29.279 align:start position:0%
curriculum
 
02:45:31.510 --> 02:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
of at-home options for all different
 
02:45:33.429 --> 02:45:33.439 align:start position:0%
types of therapies
 
02:45:35.750 --> 02:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
and again so part of what i do is
 
02:45:39.110 --> 02:45:39.120 align:start position:0%
provide those resources to these
 
02:45:39.120 --> 02:45:40.630 align:start position:0%
provide those resources to these
families

02:45:40.630 --> 02:45:40.640 align:start position:0%
families
 
02:45:43.030 --> 02:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
and if my kid i i wish i could have
 
02:45:44.309 --> 02:45:44.319 align:start position:0%
brought him today because he is a
 
02:45:46.870 --> 02:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
treasure he's a joy and he deserves
 
02:45:50.870 --> 02:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:52.389 --> 02:45:52.399 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:45:53.510 --> 02:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
are there further questions
 
02:45:55.190 --> 02:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock
 
02:45:57.349 --> 02:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and good have
 
02:45:59.030 --> 02:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
almost good afternoon
 
02:46:01.349 --> 02:46:01.359 align:start position:0%
uh just a quick question i've listened
 
02:46:03.830 --> 02:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
to two or three speakers already and
 
02:46:05.030 --> 02:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
they're talking about the numbers of
 
02:46:08.230 --> 02:46:08.240 align:start position:0%
youngsters participating in the 193
 
02:46:09.830 --> 02:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
phase of the education options in new
 
02:46:09.840 --> 02:46:10.790 align:start position:0%
phase of the education options in new
hampshire

02:46:10.790 --> 02:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:46:12.070 --> 02:46:12.080 align:start position:0%
do you have a
 
02:46:13.910 --> 02:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
not the number of social contacts or
 
02:46:15.990 --> 02:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
media outlets can you tell me how many
 
02:46:17.349 --> 02:46:17.359 align:start position:0%
young i was thinking about the district
 
02:46:18.950 --> 02:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
transfer and all this
 
02:46:21.670 --> 02:46:21.680 align:start position:0%
is is there a repository of a number or
 
02:46:24.309 --> 02:46:24.319 align:start position:0%
can you tell me the number uh or does
 
02:46:26.550 --> 02:46:26.560 align:start position:0%
doe have the number of students
 
02:46:28.389 --> 02:46:28.399 align:start position:0%
participating in this program
 
02:46:31.030 --> 02:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
in that are traditional notifying our
 
02:46:33.349 --> 02:46:33.359 align:start position:0%
essay 193a homeschoolers i just want to
 
02:46:35.910 --> 02:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
make sure i understand the question
 
02:46:38.550 --> 02:46:38.560 align:start position:0%
so they do have a number but
 
02:46:40.870 --> 02:46:40.880 align:start position:0%
to explain a little bit we went from
 
02:46:43.670 --> 02:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
notifying every year in
 
02:46:45.910 --> 02:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
in years past right that the law changed
 
02:46:48.150 --> 02:46:48.160 align:start position:0%
so that now we notify only one time and
 
02:46:50.950 --> 02:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
this is again why this legislation this
 
02:46:54.070 --> 02:46:54.080 align:start position:0%
tweak here is needed because how are we
 
02:46:56.630 --> 02:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
keeping track if someone moves from a
 
02:46:59.349 --> 02:46:59.359 align:start position:0%
district to another district will they
 
02:47:01.590 --> 02:47:01.600 align:start position:0%
notified with that district and now do
 
02:47:03.670 --> 02:47:03.680 align:start position:0%
they notify again who do they tell that
 
02:47:06.230 --> 02:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
they moved this needs to be addressed in
 
02:47:09.750 --> 02:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
the law so there is a notification
 
02:47:12.870 --> 02:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
we do need to look at that piece
 
02:47:15.349 --> 02:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
aside from this tweak which will help
 
02:47:17.510 --> 02:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
but the department of education really
 
02:47:20.389 --> 02:47:20.399 align:start position:0%
they get a number from the participating
 
02:47:22.469 --> 02:47:22.479 align:start position:0%
agencies so the private schools that act
 
02:47:23.750 --> 02:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
as pas
 
02:47:26.150 --> 02:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
they just get a number this is how many
 
02:47:26.160 --> 02:47:27.670 align:start position:0%
they just get a number this is how many
notified

02:47:27.670 --> 02:47:27.680 align:start position:0%
notified
 
02:47:29.990 --> 02:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
right so the public school enters it
 
02:47:31.910 --> 02:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
into their database they also provide a
 
02:47:31.920 --> 02:47:33.030 align:start position:0%
into their database they also provide a
number

02:47:33.030 --> 02:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
number
 
02:47:35.510 --> 02:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
right so i assume the doe totals that
 
02:47:38.070 --> 02:47:38.080 align:start position:0%
all together but because on the back end
 
02:47:41.670 --> 02:47:41.680 align:start position:0%
of this we don't have a good system
 
02:47:44.150 --> 02:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
so when a student leaves goes to another
 
02:47:46.550 --> 02:47:46.560 align:start position:0%
educational option
 
02:47:49.190 --> 02:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
it's muddy
 
02:47:52.150 --> 02:47:52.160 align:start position:0%
go ahead just so with all the mud can we
 
02:47:55.030 --> 02:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
saffron or call a number do we do you
 
02:47:57.910 --> 02:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
have a a relatively accurate as a
 
02:48:00.150 --> 02:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
self-professed expert here uh of what
 
02:48:01.349 --> 02:48:01.359 align:start position:0%
the number is
 
02:48:03.830 --> 02:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
so i would say there is not an accurate
 
02:48:06.230 --> 02:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
number so the department of education
 
02:48:08.309 --> 02:48:08.319 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure michelle or erica can
 
02:48:10.309 --> 02:48:10.319 align:start position:0%
provide that information directly from
 
02:48:11.429 --> 02:48:11.439 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of the department of
 
02:48:13.429 --> 02:48:13.439 align:start position:0%
education but because of all these
 
02:48:15.910 --> 02:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
things that i'm saying it's not an
 
02:48:18.150 --> 02:48:18.160 align:start position:0%
accurate number okay thank you thank you
 
02:48:18.160 --> 02:48:19.349 align:start position:0%
accurate number okay thank you thank you
chairman

02:48:19.349 --> 02:48:19.359 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
02:48:21.269 --> 02:48:21.279 align:start position:0%
further questions yes representative
 
02:48:21.279 --> 02:48:22.389 align:start position:0%
further questions yes representative
mullen

02:48:22.389 --> 02:48:22.399 align:start position:0%
mullen
 
02:48:24.630 --> 02:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:48:26.309 --> 02:48:26.319 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:48:26.319 --> 02:48:27.269 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

02:48:27.269 --> 02:48:27.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:48:30.070 --> 02:48:30.080 align:start position:0%
are there school districts
 
02:48:31.830 --> 02:48:31.840 align:start position:0%
that are already
 
02:48:33.990 --> 02:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
integrating home-schooled kids into
 
02:48:37.510 --> 02:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
curricular and co-curricular experiences
 
02:48:39.510 --> 02:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:48:41.750 --> 02:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
if so
 
02:48:45.110 --> 02:48:45.120 align:start position:0%
are there model policies that you uh
 
02:48:47.190 --> 02:48:47.200 align:start position:0%
have access to
 
02:48:50.630 --> 02:48:50.640 align:start position:0%
yes so it is actually fairly common
 
02:48:52.469 --> 02:48:52.479 align:start position:0%
for students to
 
02:48:52.479 --> 02:48:53.750 align:start position:0%
for students to
um

02:48:53.750 --> 02:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:48:55.830 --> 02:48:55.840 align:start position:0%
to take classes it's curricular and
 
02:48:57.429 --> 02:48:57.439 align:start position:0%
co-curricular so basically this is
 
02:48:57.439 --> 02:48:58.469 align:start position:0%
co-curricular so basically this is
anything

02:48:58.469 --> 02:48:58.479 align:start position:0%
anything
 
02:49:00.230 --> 02:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
so if they want to
 
02:49:01.910 --> 02:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
join an after school club if they want
 
02:49:04.150 --> 02:49:04.160 align:start position:0%
to go for chemistry lab any of these
 
02:49:07.030 --> 02:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
things are legally a right for taxpaying
 
02:49:10.070 --> 02:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
home educated families so yes there is a
 
02:49:11.750 --> 02:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of homeschoolers that
 
02:49:15.030 --> 02:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
utilize this kind of a la carte to
 
02:49:17.670 --> 02:49:17.680 align:start position:0%
create their homeschool program
 
02:49:20.630 --> 02:49:20.640 align:start position:0%
and so the experience that i have had
 
02:49:22.950 --> 02:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
in dealing directly with districts is
 
02:49:25.510 --> 02:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
they don't know what they don't know
 
02:49:26.469 --> 02:49:26.479 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
02:49:28.870 --> 02:49:28.880 align:start position:0%
the rochester district for example had
 
02:49:31.429 --> 02:49:31.439 align:start position:0%
to be taken to the extreme level of
 
02:49:34.309 --> 02:49:34.319 align:start position:0%
legal intervention typically when i call
 
02:49:36.070 --> 02:49:36.080 align:start position:0%
or michelle or so one of us calls the
 
02:49:38.309 --> 02:49:38.319 align:start position:0%
school district we speak to them and let
 
02:49:42.230 --> 02:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
them know this law is here let me email
 
02:49:44.150 --> 02:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
you this law and give me a call and we
 
02:49:46.469 --> 02:49:46.479 align:start position:0%
can go over it they honestly either
 
02:49:47.670 --> 02:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
02:49:50.150 --> 02:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
they really just don't know or
 
02:49:51.349 --> 02:49:51.359 align:start position:0%
it's so
 
02:49:54.230 --> 02:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
outdated and they don't know how to
 
02:49:55.830 --> 02:49:55.840 align:start position:0%
update it
 
02:49:55.840 --> 02:49:56.630 align:start position:0%
update it
so

02:49:56.630 --> 02:49:56.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:49:59.190 --> 02:49:59.200 align:start position:0%
this part of
 
02:50:01.590 --> 02:50:01.600 align:start position:0%
this updating of the law that's why this
 
02:50:04.469 --> 02:50:04.479 align:start position:0%
is so important we want the public
 
02:50:06.830 --> 02:50:06.840 align:start position:0%
schools to have an easier
 
02:50:09.910 --> 02:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
time they don't want me calling them
 
02:50:12.150 --> 02:50:12.160 align:start position:0%
saying you guys this is from 20 years
 
02:50:15.190 --> 02:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
ago nobody wants that we want everybody
 
02:50:18.230 --> 02:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
to be on the same page right so that
 
02:50:19.670 --> 02:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
they know
 
02:50:21.910 --> 02:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
this is the law this is how we
 
02:50:24.150 --> 02:50:24.160 align:start position:0%
accomplish the law there isn't a
 
02:50:27.670 --> 02:50:27.680 align:start position:0%
standard set of guidelines um that is
 
02:50:30.710 --> 02:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
something that i think would be amazing
 
02:50:32.870 --> 02:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
because again the wording
 
02:50:34.389 --> 02:50:34.399 align:start position:0%
they just don't know what they don't
 
02:50:36.790 --> 02:50:36.800 align:start position:0%
know i do know for a fact that the
 
02:50:39.750 --> 02:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
rochester school district did legally
 
02:50:42.550 --> 02:50:42.560 align:start position:0%
have to update their policy so they have
 
02:50:44.950 --> 02:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
one and it's a great place to start
 
02:50:46.790 --> 02:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you very much further
 
02:50:47.830 --> 02:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
02:50:49.510 --> 02:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
representative luno
 
02:50:51.190 --> 02:50:51.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair and thank
 
02:50:52.790 --> 02:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
you very much for joining us this
 
02:50:54.469 --> 02:50:54.479 align:start position:0%
morning and it's great to have an expert
 
02:50:54.479 --> 02:50:55.269 align:start position:0%
morning and it's great to have an expert
um

02:50:55.269 --> 02:50:55.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:50:57.670 --> 02:50:57.680 align:start position:0%
to um uh to you know provide the
 
02:51:01.030 --> 02:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
committee with um with information
 
02:51:01.040 --> 02:51:02.870 align:start position:0%
committee with um with information
um

02:51:02.870 --> 02:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:05.030 --> 02:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
sort of getting to um
 
02:51:08.070 --> 02:51:08.080 align:start position:0%
to what's uh what's in in uh
 
02:51:10.150 --> 02:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
home school and what's in in public
 
02:51:12.070 --> 02:51:12.080 align:start position:0%
schools in particular that was one of
 
02:51:13.990 --> 02:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
the things that you sort of addressed
 
02:51:16.309 --> 02:51:16.319 align:start position:0%
that uh that this bill would um would
 
02:51:18.309 --> 02:51:18.319 align:start position:0%
help facilitate but i was wondering if
 
02:51:20.150 --> 02:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
you could comment on
 
02:51:21.990 --> 02:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
02:51:25.269 --> 02:51:25.279 align:start position:0%
the the home school
 
02:51:29.269 --> 02:51:29.279 align:start position:0%
statute 193 a colon 4
 
02:51:31.510 --> 02:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
refers to the same minimum academic
 
02:51:33.030 --> 02:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
standards that
 
02:51:36.630 --> 02:51:36.640 align:start position:0%
that exist for public schools in 193e
 
02:51:45.349 --> 02:51:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:47.110 --> 02:51:47.120 align:start position:0%
so i can ask the question a different
 
02:51:49.990 --> 02:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
way are our home school standards the
 
02:51:52.309 --> 02:51:52.319 align:start position:0%
same held to the same minimum academic
 
02:51:57.110 --> 02:51:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:00.230 --> 02:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
so we have a separate set of
 
02:52:03.750 --> 02:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
requirements that in many ways mirror a
 
02:52:05.349 --> 02:52:05.359 align:start position:0%
public school
 
02:52:08.309 --> 02:52:08.319 align:start position:0%
but our subject requirement is listed in
 
02:52:11.030 --> 02:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
very plain language in the law
 
02:52:15.670 --> 02:52:15.680 align:start position:0%
so our academic requirements
 
02:52:19.030 --> 02:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
everything falls upon the parent
 
02:52:23.429 --> 02:52:23.439 align:start position:0%
accountability falls upon the parent
 
02:52:26.150 --> 02:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
and that is the way the law is written
 
02:52:26.160 --> 02:52:26.830 align:start position:0%
and that is the way the law is written
for

02:52:26.830 --> 02:52:26.840 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:52:29.670 --> 02:52:29.680 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers and that is the way that
 
02:52:30.950 --> 02:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
it should be
 
02:52:30.960 --> 02:52:31.990 align:start position:0%
it should be
um

02:52:31.990 --> 02:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:52:33.349 --> 02:52:33.359 align:start position:0%
when you were five you were held
 
02:52:35.990 --> 02:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
accountable to your mom your dad
 
02:52:38.550 --> 02:52:38.560 align:start position:0%
and the same goes for education and
 
02:52:41.110 --> 02:52:41.120 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers believe very strongly
 
02:52:41.120 --> 02:52:42.630 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers believe very strongly
that

02:52:42.630 --> 02:52:42.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:52:45.429 --> 02:52:45.439 align:start position:0%
the educational requirements need to be
 
02:52:45.439 --> 02:52:47.030 align:start position:0%
the educational requirements need to be
followed

02:52:47.030 --> 02:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
followed
 
02:52:49.910 --> 02:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
but also that we have the freedom to
 
02:52:49.920 --> 02:52:51.030 align:start position:0%
but also that we have the freedom to
craft

02:52:51.030 --> 02:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
craft
 
02:52:52.230 --> 02:52:52.240 align:start position:0%
our own
 
02:52:52.240 --> 02:52:54.830 align:start position:0%
our own
child's

02:52:54.830 --> 02:52:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:57.830 --> 02:52:57.840 align:start position:0%
education but a follow-up mr chair
 
02:53:00.230 --> 02:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
that's that's fine i'm not arguing with
 
02:53:02.710 --> 02:53:02.720 align:start position:0%
that but are the standards the same for
 
02:53:05.349 --> 02:53:05.359 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers as they are for um
 
02:53:07.750 --> 02:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
for public school uh public schools or
 
02:53:09.110 --> 02:53:09.120 align:start position:0%
is it different
 
02:53:13.670 --> 02:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
so we are required by law to
 
02:53:16.710 --> 02:53:16.720 align:start position:0%
choose a year-end assessment
 
02:53:20.389 --> 02:53:20.399 align:start position:0%
and so we have options in that there are
 
02:53:22.550 --> 02:53:22.560 align:start position:0%
three currently in the law two of them
 
02:53:24.389 --> 02:53:24.399 align:start position:0%
are what most people choose
 
02:53:25.990 --> 02:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
just to clarify i'm talking about the
 
02:53:28.469 --> 02:53:28.479 align:start position:0%
minimum academic standards
 
02:53:30.389 --> 02:53:30.399 align:start position:0%
so they're the same or different
 
02:53:30.399 --> 02:53:31.269 align:start position:0%
so they're the same or different
we

02:53:31.269 --> 02:53:31.279 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:53:33.750 --> 02:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
we are a different educational pathway
 
02:53:35.670 --> 02:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
than public school students and much
 
02:53:38.309 --> 02:53:38.319 align:start position:0%
like private school students prendapods
 
02:53:39.990 --> 02:53:40.000 align:start position:0%
or any other educational pathway
 
02:53:42.389 --> 02:53:42.399 align:start position:0%
including the efa funding we have our
 
02:53:47.830 --> 02:53:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:49.349 --> 02:53:49.359 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there further
 
02:53:51.190 --> 02:53:51.200 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
02:53:53.269 --> 02:53:53.279 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you very much thank
 
02:53:53.279 --> 02:53:54.630 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you very much thank
you

02:53:54.630 --> 02:53:54.640 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:53:56.389 --> 02:53:56.399 align:start position:0%
i'd also like to take the opportunity
 
02:53:58.710 --> 02:53:58.720 align:start position:0%
here to thank all our homeschoolers that
 
02:54:00.630 --> 02:54:00.640 align:start position:0%
came today i'm looking around at the
 
02:54:02.389 --> 02:54:02.399 align:start position:0%
crowd in front of me and
 
02:54:03.990 --> 02:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
looks like i'm seeing somebody between
 
02:54:06.550 --> 02:54:06.560 align:start position:0%
the ages of two and possibly three out
 
02:54:06.560 --> 02:54:08.230 align:start position:0%
the ages of two and possibly three out
there

02:54:08.230 --> 02:54:08.240 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:54:10.469 --> 02:54:10.479 align:start position:0%
and i've seen a toddler go out that's
 
02:54:13.309 --> 02:54:13.319 align:start position:0%
probably not even to one yet or about
 
02:54:16.230 --> 02:54:16.240 align:start position:0%
1.3 or something like that
 
02:54:18.070 --> 02:54:18.080 align:start position:0%
and i really appreciate the way
 
02:54:20.469 --> 02:54:20.479 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers are always
 
02:54:24.309 --> 02:54:24.319 align:start position:0%
behaving and on task and listening
 
02:54:25.990 --> 02:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
we do have one more here i didn't have
 
02:54:28.950 --> 02:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
that one presented to me
 
02:54:30.950 --> 02:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
however you know i just want to
 
02:54:33.750 --> 02:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
compliment you on what you're doing here
 
02:54:37.349 --> 02:54:37.359 align:start position:0%
and this is a unique program as it is
 
02:54:39.590 --> 02:54:39.600 align:start position:0%
in our state and
 
02:54:41.990 --> 02:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
it's been very successful as well
 
02:54:44.070 --> 02:54:44.080 align:start position:0%
so with that i'd like to have the last
 
02:54:46.550 --> 02:54:46.560 align:start position:0%
person to testify
 
02:54:48.790 --> 02:54:48.800 align:start position:0%
evidently we just received this car from
 
02:54:53.269 --> 02:54:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:08.630 --> 02:55:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:10.309 --> 02:55:10.319 align:start position:0%
yeah we need to have these up here
 
02:55:12.309 --> 02:55:12.319 align:start position:0%
because now we're going to be stringing
 
02:55:13.830 --> 02:55:13.840 align:start position:0%
this thing out
 
02:55:15.590 --> 02:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
i am going to put a time limit on the
 
02:55:17.830 --> 02:55:17.840 align:start position:0%
remaining cards absolutely
 
02:55:19.990 --> 02:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
i i apologize thank you committee chair
 
02:55:21.990 --> 02:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
thank you committee member i'm sorry i
 
02:55:23.990 --> 02:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
didn't know that my pink card had gotten
 
02:55:26.469 --> 02:55:26.479 align:start position:0%
up there uh which is why i had left the
 
02:55:28.790 --> 02:55:28.800 align:start position:0%
building or left hold on one second i
 
02:55:31.510 --> 02:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
want to see how many we got coming here
 
02:55:32.950 --> 02:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
we are going to have to put a time
 
02:55:35.110 --> 02:55:35.120 align:start position:0%
constraint on all this i will be less
 
02:55:37.030 --> 02:55:37.040 align:start position:0%
than a minute
 
02:55:39.750 --> 02:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
okay go for it okay my name is rusty ann
 
02:55:42.309 --> 02:55:42.319 align:start position:0%
chester i am i currently live in bedford
 
02:55:43.830 --> 02:55:43.840 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
02:55:46.790 --> 02:55:46.800 align:start position:0%
my history is older than that so it's
 
02:55:48.710 --> 02:55:48.720 align:start position:0%
not from the town that i currently live
 
02:55:51.269 --> 02:55:51.279 align:start position:0%
in however i had two special needs
 
02:55:51.279 --> 02:55:52.309 align:start position:0%
in however i had two special needs
children

02:55:52.309 --> 02:55:52.319 align:start position:0%
children
 
02:55:54.070 --> 02:55:54.080 align:start position:0%
one was
 
02:55:57.269 --> 02:55:57.279 align:start position:0%
coded severely emotionally disturbed
 
02:55:58.790 --> 02:55:58.800 align:start position:0%
because that's the only way that i could
 
02:56:00.630 --> 02:56:00.640 align:start position:0%
get her the services that she needed
 
02:56:03.349 --> 02:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
because in the public school system
 
02:56:05.670 --> 02:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
because of her iq status and she refused
 
02:56:08.150 --> 02:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
to be homeschooled the other one
 
02:56:11.190 --> 02:56:11.200 align:start position:0%
had significant emotional disabilities
 
02:56:13.990 --> 02:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
and i can tell you right now that
 
02:56:17.590 --> 02:56:17.600 align:start position:0%
um that school system wanted my severely
 
02:56:19.750 --> 02:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
emoted one so they were both labeled
 
02:56:22.389 --> 02:56:22.399 align:start position:0%
severely demo emotionally disturbed but
 
02:56:23.750 --> 02:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
my um
 
02:56:26.070 --> 02:56:26.080 align:start position:0%
my younger child had other learning
 
02:56:29.590 --> 02:56:29.600 align:start position:0%
disabilities as a result of that as well
 
02:56:31.349 --> 02:56:31.359 align:start position:0%
when it came time for the standardized
 
02:56:31.359 --> 02:56:32.309 align:start position:0%
when it came time for the standardized
testing

02:56:32.309 --> 02:56:32.319 align:start position:0%
testing
 
02:56:33.830 --> 02:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
they wanted my
 
02:56:35.990 --> 02:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
child that had learning disabilities to
 
02:56:37.110 --> 02:56:37.120 align:start position:0%
stay home
 
02:56:38.790 --> 02:56:38.800 align:start position:0%
so that they would keep their standards
 
02:56:41.670 --> 02:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
up they wanted my my child that
 
02:56:44.790 --> 02:56:44.800 align:start position:0%
was exceptional to attend so they could
 
02:56:46.710 --> 02:56:46.720 align:start position:0%
keep their standards up so the bottom
 
02:56:49.429 --> 02:56:49.439 align:start position:0%
line is is that forcing homeschoolers to
 
02:56:51.830 --> 02:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
represent that for to to do that the
 
02:56:54.389 --> 02:56:54.399 align:start position:0%
school systems are already manipulating
 
02:56:55.830 --> 02:56:55.840 align:start position:0%
the facts
 
02:56:57.510 --> 02:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
it's time to stop
 
02:57:00.630 --> 02:57:00.640 align:start position:0%
and holding homeschoolers to a standard
 
02:57:03.190 --> 02:57:03.200 align:start position:0%
that we don't we're not holding our
 
02:57:06.309 --> 02:57:06.319 align:start position:0%
public schools to that same standard
 
02:57:09.429 --> 02:57:09.439 align:start position:0%
they've found a way around it
 
02:57:10.630 --> 02:57:10.640 align:start position:0%
and that's all i have thank you very
 
02:57:10.640 --> 02:57:11.590 align:start position:0%
and that's all i have thank you very
much

02:57:11.590 --> 02:57:11.600 align:start position:0%

adriana um hello my name is adriana
 
02:58:30.070 --> 02:58:30.080 align:start position:0%
patafico and i am testifying in support
 
02:58:32.469 --> 02:58:32.479 align:start position:0%
of house bill 1663.
 
02:58:34.150 --> 02:58:34.160 align:start position:0%
i have lived in the great state of new
 
02:58:36.150 --> 02:58:36.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire for over 20 years and during
 
02:58:37.190 --> 02:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
that time
 
02:58:39.590 --> 02:58:39.600 align:start position:0%
i have paid property taxes a large
 
02:58:42.550 --> 02:58:42.560 align:start position:0%
portion going towards the local schools
 
02:58:45.110 --> 02:58:45.120 align:start position:0%
i home educate two children however the
 
02:58:47.429 --> 02:58:47.439 align:start position:0%
however over the years i have not been
 
02:58:49.510 --> 02:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
able to access any materials from my
 
02:58:51.349 --> 02:58:51.359 align:start position:0%
local public school
 
02:58:54.389 --> 02:58:54.399 align:start position:0%
as an example two years ago my child's
 
02:58:55.990 --> 02:58:56.000 align:start position:0%
laptop broke and i approached the school
 
02:58:57.750 --> 02:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
requesting to borrow one for just a
 
02:58:59.269 --> 02:58:59.279 align:start position:0%
short period of time
 
02:59:00.950 --> 02:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
they had been advertising that they had
 
02:59:02.230 --> 02:59:02.240 align:start position:0%
gotten a grant
 
02:59:03.830 --> 02:59:03.840 align:start position:0%
because of the pandemic and they had
 
02:59:06.150 --> 02:59:06.160 align:start position:0%
extras however as a home educator i was
 
02:59:07.990 --> 02:59:08.000 align:start position:0%
denied this request
 
02:59:09.830 --> 02:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
i believe that all home educated
 
02:59:11.510 --> 02:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
children should have equal access to
 
02:59:13.269 --> 02:59:13.279 align:start position:0%
their public schools material within
 
02:59:15.590 --> 02:59:15.600 align:start position:0%
reason and equal access to the school's
 
02:59:17.990 --> 02:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
classes sports and clubs
 
02:59:20.870 --> 02:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
education is not a one size fits all it
 
02:59:22.389 --> 02:59:22.399 align:start position:0%
is important for children to have
 
02:59:24.950 --> 02:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
options to best meet their needs the
 
02:59:26.710 --> 02:59:26.720 align:start position:0%
simple change of the current wording of
 
02:59:29.190 --> 02:59:29.200 align:start position:0%
the law from may to shell will ensure
 
02:59:30.790 --> 02:59:30.800 align:start position:0%
equal access for all children in new
 
02:59:30.800 --> 02:59:32.070 align:start position:0%
equal access for all children in new
hampshire

02:59:32.070 --> 02:59:32.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:59:33.910 --> 02:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
this bill also provides much-needed
 
02:59:36.070 --> 02:59:36.080 align:start position:0%
protection for children with special
 
02:59:38.309 --> 02:59:38.319 align:start position:0%
education challenges by allowing the
 
02:59:41.349 --> 02:59:41.359 align:start position:0%
consideration in their annual assessment
 
02:59:44.230 --> 02:59:44.240 align:start position:0%
um please support house bill 1663 and
 
02:59:45.590 --> 02:59:45.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for the gift of your time and
 
02:59:47.349 --> 02:59:47.359 align:start position:0%
consideration of this bill
 
02:59:49.510 --> 02:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:59:52.790 --> 02:59:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:01.510 --> 03:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:03.990 --> 03:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
hello and thank you for your time today
 
03:00:06.230 --> 03:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
i'm entering this testimony for support
 
03:00:06.240 --> 03:00:07.190 align:start position:0%
i'm entering this testimony for support
of

03:00:07.190 --> 03:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:00:10.309 --> 03:00:10.319 align:start position:0%
hb 1663 into the record would you please
 
03:00:12.630 --> 03:00:12.640 align:start position:0%
not read your testimony try to condense
 
03:00:14.950 --> 03:00:14.960 align:start position:0%
it or summarize it thank you
 
03:00:15.990 --> 03:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
because i'm going to keep it short and
 
03:00:17.429 --> 03:00:17.439 align:start position:0%
sweet because many of the salient points
 
03:00:20.150 --> 03:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
were already hit upon previously
 
03:00:21.590 --> 03:00:21.600 align:start position:0%
again my name is angel briston i live in
 
03:00:23.190 --> 03:00:23.200 align:start position:0%
manchester new hampshire and my husband
 
03:00:25.990 --> 03:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
and i home educate our daughter
 
03:00:28.389 --> 03:00:28.399 align:start position:0%
and because of that we support this bill
 
03:00:29.750 --> 03:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
i'm going to touch upon the salient
 
03:00:32.389 --> 03:00:32.399 align:start position:0%
points for our family firstly regarding
 
03:00:35.030 --> 03:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
part two the home education was designed
 
03:00:37.269 --> 03:00:37.279 align:start position:0%
to be directed by the parents
 
03:00:39.269 --> 03:00:39.279 align:start position:0%
it's solely our right responsibility to
 
03:00:41.429 --> 03:00:41.439 align:start position:0%
educate our children and so our family
 
03:00:43.750 --> 03:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
does not need to solicit
 
03:00:46.070 --> 03:00:46.080 align:start position:0%
input from the participating agency so
 
03:00:47.670 --> 03:00:47.680 align:start position:0%
we need that clarification that portion
 
03:00:49.110 --> 03:00:49.120 align:start position:0%
that says it must be agreed upon with
 
03:00:50.710 --> 03:00:50.720 align:start position:0%
the participating agency because it was
 
03:00:52.630 --> 03:00:52.640 align:start position:0%
never intended that a home education
 
03:00:54.150 --> 03:00:54.160 align:start position:0%
program must be intended to be agreed
 
03:00:56.389 --> 03:00:56.399 align:start position:0%
upon by both parents the participating
 
03:00:57.910 --> 03:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
agency serves only to acknowledge the
 
03:00:59.670 --> 03:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
letter of intent and to retain the
 
03:01:00.710 --> 03:01:00.720 align:start position:0%
letter and of course notify the
 
03:01:03.429 --> 03:01:03.439 align:start position:0%
department of education
 
03:01:05.990 --> 03:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh next regarding part three if our
 
03:01:07.269 --> 03:01:07.279 align:start position:0%
family ever moves to another school
 
03:01:08.790 --> 03:01:08.800 align:start position:0%
district we just want it clear that
 
03:01:10.230 --> 03:01:10.240 align:start position:0%
we're only required to notify one
 
03:01:12.230 --> 03:01:12.240 align:start position:0%
participating agency
 
03:01:13.349 --> 03:01:13.359 align:start position:0%
that would be terminating our home
 
03:01:15.030 --> 03:01:15.040 align:start position:0%
education program in that district and
 
03:01:17.750 --> 03:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
then starting a new district we don't
 
03:01:19.990 --> 03:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
want to be in violation or have some
 
03:01:21.910 --> 03:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
statement violation because of the
 
03:01:23.429 --> 03:01:23.439 align:start position:0%
incorrect inference that would be
 
03:01:25.429 --> 03:01:25.439 align:start position:0%
required to notify more than one
 
03:01:27.510 --> 03:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
participating agency
 
03:01:28.950 --> 03:01:28.960 align:start position:0%
and even though it's been talked about
 
03:01:30.469 --> 03:01:30.479 align:start position:0%
quite a bit i still feel like it's
 
03:01:32.389 --> 03:01:32.399 align:start position:0%
really important to reiterate the
 
03:01:33.910 --> 03:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
portion about the academic achievement
 
03:01:36.550 --> 03:01:36.560 align:start position:0%
requirements um we are taxpayers we have
 
03:01:38.710 --> 03:01:38.720 align:start position:0%
a couple of properties here in the city
 
03:01:40.469 --> 03:01:40.479 align:start position:0%
and we're paying our fair share of taxes
 
03:01:41.830 --> 03:01:41.840 align:start position:0%
and yet our children are being held to
 
03:01:43.830 --> 03:01:43.840 align:start position:0%
our child being held to a different
 
03:01:43.840 --> 03:01:45.030 align:start position:0%
our child being held to a different
standard

03:01:45.030 --> 03:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
standard
 
03:01:47.830 --> 03:01:47.840 align:start position:0%
makes no sense that
 
03:01:49.590 --> 03:01:49.600 align:start position:0%
the 40th percentile is there for
 
03:01:51.349 --> 03:01:51.359 align:start position:0%
homeschooled students when there's no
 
03:01:52.950 --> 03:01:52.960 align:start position:0%
other child on any of the edge of other
 
03:01:55.510 --> 03:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
educational tracks all of which receive
 
03:01:58.150 --> 03:01:58.160 align:start position:0%
public funding taxpayer funding again
 
03:02:00.070 --> 03:02:00.080 align:start position:0%
the efas the printer
 
03:02:02.150 --> 03:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
the public schools printer pods public
 
03:02:02.160 --> 03:02:03.190 align:start position:0%
the public schools printer pods public
schools

03:02:03.190 --> 03:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
schools
 
03:02:05.830 --> 03:02:05.840 align:start position:0%
um and the efa participants have nothing
 
03:02:08.070 --> 03:02:08.080 align:start position:0%
written in content
 
03:02:09.349 --> 03:02:09.359 align:start position:0%
nothing written in statute so it's just
 
03:02:09.359 --> 03:02:11.110 align:start position:0%
nothing written in statute so it's just
inequitable

03:02:11.110 --> 03:02:11.120 align:start position:0%
inequitable
 
03:02:13.750 --> 03:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
we don't want that for our family so
 
03:02:16.389 --> 03:02:16.399 align:start position:0%
your time limit is up we've gone well
 
03:02:19.030 --> 03:02:19.040 align:start position:0%
over two minutes now okay i'm giving
 
03:02:20.230 --> 03:02:20.240 align:start position:0%
everybody two minutes now because it
 
03:02:21.750 --> 03:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
seeks to correct these fallacies we're
 
03:02:23.030 --> 03:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
in support of the bill and we request
 
03:02:24.630 --> 03:02:24.640 align:start position:0%
that you please pass it thank you very
 
03:02:25.990 --> 03:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
much thank you very much
 
03:02:35.110 --> 03:02:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:38.070 --> 03:02:38.080 align:start position:0%
uh hi my name is carrie lesage i'm a new
 
03:02:40.309 --> 03:02:40.319 align:start position:0%
hampshire resident living in candia and
 
03:02:41.349 --> 03:02:41.359 align:start position:0%
i appreciate you listening to my
 
03:02:43.670 --> 03:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
testimony today and i'll just briefly
 
03:02:43.680 --> 03:02:45.510 align:start position:0%
testimony today and i'll just briefly
summarize

03:02:45.510 --> 03:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
summarize
 
03:02:47.750 --> 03:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
i'm coming strongly in support of hb
 
03:02:47.760 --> 03:02:49.510 align:start position:0%
i'm coming strongly in support of hb
1663

03:02:49.510 --> 03:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
1663
 
03:02:50.710 --> 03:02:50.720 align:start position:0%
because i think it would bring some
 
03:02:53.110 --> 03:02:53.120 align:start position:0%
really much needed clarity to the rules
 
03:02:55.830 --> 03:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
for unfunded homeschoolers and um i
 
03:02:57.269 --> 03:02:57.279 align:start position:0%
wanted to just quickly tell you three
 
03:02:59.190 --> 03:02:59.200 align:start position:0%
important things about our family as
 
03:03:01.110 --> 03:03:01.120 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers under 193a we're
 
03:03:03.429 --> 03:03:03.439 align:start position:0%
completely unfunded by anybody besides
 
03:03:05.429 --> 03:03:05.439 align:start position:0%
ourselves completely out of pocket for
 
03:03:07.190 --> 03:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
our educational program
 
03:03:08.790 --> 03:03:08.800 align:start position:0%
we do pay our local taxes support our
 
03:03:11.110 --> 03:03:11.120 align:start position:0%
local schools very happy to do that
 
03:03:12.389 --> 03:03:12.399 align:start position:0%
and lastly we have nothing to do with
 
03:03:14.389 --> 03:03:14.399 align:start position:0%
the efa program
 
03:03:16.070 --> 03:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
just to clarify because i know it's been
 
03:03:19.030 --> 03:03:19.040 align:start position:0%
a point of confusion over the last weeks
 
03:03:20.870 --> 03:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
so the reasons that i support this bill
 
03:03:22.870 --> 03:03:22.880 align:start position:0%
for our family
 
03:03:25.590 --> 03:03:25.600 align:start position:0%
is that it rectifies an inequitable
 
03:03:27.990 --> 03:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
requirement in our current law
 
03:03:29.349 --> 03:03:29.359 align:start position:0%
which that's an achievement requirement
 
03:03:30.870 --> 03:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
for home-schooled students when the
 
03:03:32.790 --> 03:03:32.800 align:start position:0%
similar requirement is not in place for
 
03:03:35.269 --> 03:03:35.279 align:start position:0%
other educational pathways and um this
 
03:03:37.510 --> 03:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
is not in my written testimony but just
 
03:03:37.520 --> 03:03:38.550 align:start position:0%
is not in my written testimony but just
in

03:03:38.550 --> 03:03:38.560 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:03:39.990 --> 03:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
response to a question that was asked
 
03:03:40.000 --> 03:03:41.510 align:start position:0%
response to a question that was asked
earlier

03:03:41.510 --> 03:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
03:03:43.429 --> 03:03:43.439 align:start position:0%
for those of us who choose
 
03:03:45.030 --> 03:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
standardized testing at the end of each
 
03:03:47.190 --> 03:03:47.200 align:start position:0%
year which our family does i kind of
 
03:03:50.309 --> 03:03:50.319 align:start position:0%
prefer it for myself
 
03:03:52.389 --> 03:03:52.399 align:start position:0%
no i don't ever get concerned about it
 
03:03:54.550 --> 03:03:54.560 align:start position:0%
because my children happen to be people
 
03:03:56.550 --> 03:03:56.560 align:start position:0%
who test well and can meet those
 
03:03:58.550 --> 03:03:58.560 align:start position:0%
requirements with flying colors but if
 
03:04:00.630 --> 03:04:00.640 align:start position:0%
we were if if we were in a situation
 
03:04:02.790 --> 03:04:02.800 align:start position:0%
where they couldn't i could see it being
 
03:04:04.870 --> 03:04:04.880 align:start position:0%
a disincentive to take a standardized
 
03:04:07.030 --> 03:04:07.040 align:start position:0%
test instead and instead to choose
 
03:04:09.670 --> 03:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
something else so um just throwing it
 
03:04:12.309 --> 03:04:12.319 align:start position:0%
out there that i think um
 
03:04:15.910 --> 03:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:18.309 --> 03:04:18.319 align:start position:0%
sorry um
 
03:04:20.230 --> 03:04:20.240 align:start position:0%
if if the requirements could be made the
 
03:04:22.630 --> 03:04:22.640 align:start position:0%
same as for all the other educational
 
03:04:24.630 --> 03:04:24.640 align:start position:0%
pathways it will help more homeschooling
 
03:04:26.469 --> 03:04:26.479 align:start position:0%
parents to feel comfortable as well
 
03:04:28.870 --> 03:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
using standardized tests if they choose
 
03:04:30.150 --> 03:04:30.160 align:start position:0%
to do that as their assessment at the
 
03:04:31.830 --> 03:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
end of the year
 
03:04:33.269 --> 03:04:33.279 align:start position:0%
and then secondly
 
03:04:34.950 --> 03:04:34.960 align:start position:0%
this bill just takes steps to clarify
 
03:04:36.550 --> 03:04:36.560 align:start position:0%
that it's the parents and not the school
 
03:04:37.910 --> 03:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
district administrators who are
 
03:04:39.429 --> 03:04:39.439 align:start position:0%
ultimately responsible for child's
 
03:04:42.389 --> 03:04:42.399 align:start position:0%
education um we take our responsibility
 
03:04:43.830 --> 03:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
quite seriously and we want to make sure
 
03:04:46.389 --> 03:04:46.399 align:start position:0%
that you that you know that we do so
 
03:04:48.309 --> 03:04:48.319 align:start position:0%
thank you and um i would ask you to
 
03:04:50.230 --> 03:04:50.240 align:start position:0%
support hb1663
 
03:04:56.790 --> 03:04:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:59.910 --> 03:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
okay jody underwood jody a long time
 
03:05:02.790 --> 03:05:02.800 align:start position:0%
since we've seen you here sb-8 croydon
 
03:05:02.800 --> 03:05:10.950 align:start position:0%
since we've seen you here sb-8 croydon
et

03:05:10.950 --> 03:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:13.110 --> 03:05:13.120 align:start position:0%
jody underwood i am chair of the croydon
 
03:05:14.790 --> 03:05:14.800 align:start position:0%
school board i'm on the board of the
 
03:05:17.510 --> 03:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
school district governance association
 
03:05:19.429 --> 03:05:19.439 align:start position:0%
i have a phd in education and i have
 
03:05:21.190 --> 03:05:21.200 align:start position:0%
been a school choice advocate in new
 
03:05:23.110 --> 03:05:23.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire for many years as has
 
03:05:24.710 --> 03:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
witnessed here
 
03:05:26.630 --> 03:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
i am not going to read all of this i'm
 
03:05:28.309 --> 03:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
going to try to summarize what my points
 
03:05:28.319 --> 03:05:29.110 align:start position:0%
going to try to summarize what my points
are

03:05:29.110 --> 03:05:29.120 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:05:32.790 --> 03:05:32.800 align:start position:0%
i do support the the proposed changes
 
03:05:34.309 --> 03:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
but there are some ways in which this
 
03:05:37.030 --> 03:05:37.040 align:start position:0%
bill doesn't go far enough in my opinion
 
03:05:37.040 --> 03:05:37.910 align:start position:0%
bill doesn't go far enough in my opinion
um

03:05:37.910 --> 03:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:05:40.150 --> 03:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
so one is it's really easy for school
 
03:05:41.670 --> 03:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
boards to lose track of what they're
 
03:05:43.830 --> 03:05:43.840 align:start position:0%
supposed to be doing about what in
 
03:05:45.269 --> 03:05:45.279 align:start position:0%
particular they're supposed to provide
 
03:05:47.030 --> 03:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
to home school students i've been on the
 
03:05:49.910 --> 03:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
board since 2010 and until i read this
 
03:05:52.469 --> 03:05:52.479 align:start position:0%
bill and looked at the rsas behind it i
 
03:05:53.670 --> 03:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
wasn't aware of everything we were
 
03:05:56.150 --> 03:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
supposed to do i want that model policy
 
03:05:57.590 --> 03:05:57.600 align:start position:0%
and i will help promulgate that around
 
03:05:59.590 --> 03:05:59.600 align:start position:0%
the state um so i'm gonna go look at
 
03:06:01.990 --> 03:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
rochester so thank you amanda
 
03:06:02.000 --> 03:06:03.429 align:start position:0%
rochester so thank you amanda
um

03:06:03.429 --> 03:06:03.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:06:05.269 --> 03:06:05.279 align:start position:0%
uh that that's point one and i think
 
03:06:07.349 --> 03:06:07.359 align:start position:0%
it's a very serious point this is how we
 
03:06:09.110 --> 03:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
learn what we're supposed to do is
 
03:06:11.990 --> 03:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
what's on that that you know must do uh
 
03:06:15.030 --> 03:06:15.040 align:start position:0%
list of policies so people have been
 
03:06:17.030 --> 03:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
talking about the inequities of the
 
03:06:18.710 --> 03:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
academic achievement
 
03:06:22.630 --> 03:06:22.640 align:start position:0%
and it's not just that end of year test
 
03:06:25.269 --> 03:06:25.279 align:start position:0%
that gets affected but it's also the
 
03:06:27.349 --> 03:06:27.359 align:start position:0%
co-curricular and curricular activities
 
03:06:29.590 --> 03:06:29.600 align:start position:0%
some kids aren't allowed to
 
03:06:31.830 --> 03:06:31.840 align:start position:0%
be involved in curricular activities
 
03:06:33.349 --> 03:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
because they're not meeting a certain
 
03:06:36.150 --> 03:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
standard but if that's the case then
 
03:06:37.750 --> 03:06:37.760 align:start position:0%
that should also be applied to the kids
 
03:06:39.349 --> 03:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
who go to public schools as well that
 
03:06:41.670 --> 03:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
would make it equitable so i mean for
 
03:06:43.429 --> 03:06:43.439 align:start position:0%
those two reasons not to restate the
 
03:06:44.710 --> 03:06:44.720 align:start position:0%
other one
 
03:06:46.150 --> 03:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
i think that language should just be
 
03:06:48.309 --> 03:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
removed so that it is equitable because
 
03:06:49.750 --> 03:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
nobody's taking kids out of public
 
03:06:51.110 --> 03:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
schools for not meeting the 40th
 
03:06:53.590 --> 03:06:53.600 align:start position:0%
percentile right
 
03:06:53.600 --> 03:06:55.349 align:start position:0%
percentile right
um

03:06:55.349 --> 03:06:55.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:06:55.359 --> 03:06:56.630 align:start position:0%
um
and

03:06:56.630 --> 03:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:06:56.640 --> 03:06:58.150 align:start position:0%
and
so

03:06:58.150 --> 03:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:06:59.910 --> 03:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
sorry it's hard to
 
03:07:02.469 --> 03:07:02.479 align:start position:0%
totally summarize i'm trying to be quick
 
03:07:02.479 --> 03:07:04.950 align:start position:0%
totally summarize i'm trying to be quick
um

03:07:04.950 --> 03:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:04.960 --> 03:07:05.910 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:07:05.910 --> 03:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:07:08.150 --> 03:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
yeah so so my another reason to remove
 
03:07:11.269 --> 03:07:11.279 align:start position:0%
it is i mean the words that the phrasing
 
03:07:14.070 --> 03:07:14.080 align:start position:0%
um that it only implies that homeschool
 
03:07:16.309 --> 03:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
students has to have to perform at the
 
03:07:18.150 --> 03:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
40th percentile there's nothing in there
 
03:07:20.309 --> 03:07:20.319 align:start position:0%
that's explicit about it
 
03:07:20.319 --> 03:07:21.190 align:start position:0%
that's explicit about it
um

03:07:21.190 --> 03:07:21.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:07:23.830 --> 03:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
but so that's another reason to remove
 
03:07:26.070 --> 03:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
it so it's really not a statute and
 
03:07:28.230 --> 03:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
there's no um consequences if they don't
 
03:07:29.429 --> 03:07:29.439 align:start position:0%
there i mean there's nothing in there
 
03:07:31.349 --> 03:07:31.359 align:start position:0%
it's really just a definition
 
03:07:34.070 --> 03:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
um so consider that when you think about
 
03:07:36.550 --> 03:07:36.560 align:start position:0%
whether to remove it or not
 
03:07:40.630 --> 03:07:40.640 align:start position:0%
um but i think um maybe to overstate it
 
03:07:43.990 --> 03:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
arguing over how to change a rule um
 
03:07:46.710 --> 03:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
that has no consequences and is not
 
03:07:48.469 --> 03:07:48.479 align:start position:0%
you know in fact clear
 
03:07:48.479 --> 03:07:49.910 align:start position:0%
you know in fact clear
um

03:07:49.910 --> 03:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:07:52.070 --> 03:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
is pointless and a waste of everybody's
 
03:07:55.030 --> 03:07:55.040 align:start position:0%
time really it should just be clarified
 
03:07:55.040 --> 03:07:56.630 align:start position:0%
time really it should just be clarified
um

03:07:56.630 --> 03:07:56.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:07:56.640 --> 03:07:58.309 align:start position:0%
um
and

03:07:58.309 --> 03:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:08:00.630 --> 03:08:00.640 align:start position:0%
uh so that's it so please vote otp for
 
03:08:03.510 --> 03:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
hb 1663 and consider making the changes
 
03:08:04.870 --> 03:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
even broader
 
03:08:07.349 --> 03:08:07.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for your attention
 
03:08:07.359 --> 03:08:08.550 align:start position:0%
thank you for your attention
questions

03:08:08.550 --> 03:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:08:09.990 --> 03:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
03:08:22.070 --> 03:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:23.830 --> 03:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
hello i'm katie mclaughlin i live in
 
03:08:25.269 --> 03:08:25.279 align:start position:0%
hampton falls i've been homeschooling
 
03:08:26.950 --> 03:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
for about 12 years my oldest is about to
 
03:08:28.550 --> 03:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
graduate and go to college
 
03:08:30.630 --> 03:08:30.640 align:start position:0%
my youngest is six i'm a part of the
 
03:08:32.870 --> 03:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
houma education advisory council and i
 
03:08:32.880 --> 03:08:34.550 align:start position:0%
houma education advisory council and i
also

03:08:34.550 --> 03:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
also
 
03:08:36.150 --> 03:08:36.160 align:start position:0%
am a part of a large network on the
 
03:08:39.190 --> 03:08:39.200 align:start position:0%
seacoast with a lot of families we do a
 
03:08:41.349 --> 03:08:41.359 align:start position:0%
lot of co-ops and a lot of mom schools
 
03:08:43.110 --> 03:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
so um it's been amazing over the last
 
03:08:45.030 --> 03:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
couple of years since the pandemic to
 
03:08:47.670 --> 03:08:47.680 align:start position:0%
see how many people have had to
 
03:08:49.110 --> 03:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to look at all their options for
 
03:08:51.269 --> 03:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
education and so i've been part of a
 
03:08:55.030 --> 03:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
team of wonderful moms and dads who have
 
03:08:56.870 --> 03:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
tried to catch those people who are
 
03:08:58.550 --> 03:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
looking for the other options and be
 
03:08:59.990 --> 03:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
just be able to gently counsel them and
 
03:09:01.590 --> 03:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
give them clear guidance on what those
 
03:09:02.950 --> 03:09:02.960 align:start position:0%
options are
 
03:09:05.429 --> 03:09:05.439 align:start position:0%
so now that we have the efa that's one
 
03:09:07.269 --> 03:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
thing and then the prenda thing we first
 
03:09:09.590 --> 03:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
want to just ask you to please remember
 
03:09:13.910 --> 03:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
that the 193 homeschoolers are
 
03:09:16.630 --> 03:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
unfunded and we we believe we have the
 
03:09:18.550 --> 03:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
right to our privacy and our liberties
 
03:09:20.790 --> 03:09:20.800 align:start position:0%
to direct oversee
 
03:09:22.309 --> 03:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
and provide the education for our
 
03:09:24.229 --> 03:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
children as we see fit
 
03:09:27.190 --> 03:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
i do like i do like the um the changing
 
03:09:29.110 --> 03:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
of the words by adding that parents can
 
03:09:31.510 --> 03:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
direct not only provide it but can
 
03:09:33.510 --> 03:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
direct it because what i see around the
 
03:09:35.349 --> 03:09:35.359 align:start position:0%
seacoast is people don't like to be
 
03:09:37.269 --> 03:09:37.279 align:start position:0%
isolated and on their own they actually
 
03:09:39.190 --> 03:09:39.200 align:start position:0%
do like to work with other people they
 
03:09:41.110 --> 03:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
like to be social they like to look for
 
03:09:41.120 --> 03:09:42.070 align:start position:0%
like to be social they like to look for
help

03:09:42.070 --> 03:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
help
 
03:09:42.080 --> 03:09:43.030 align:start position:0%
help
and

03:09:43.030 --> 03:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:09:45.269 --> 03:09:45.279 align:start position:0%
so people are doing that and i it's
 
03:09:47.510 --> 03:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
there's nothing wrong or illegal about
 
03:09:49.830 --> 03:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
asking a mom who's gifted in science to
 
03:09:51.110 --> 03:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
teach science
 
03:09:53.349 --> 03:09:53.359 align:start position:0%
and a parent who's gifted in another
 
03:09:55.190 --> 03:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
area to teach that and they do that
 
03:09:55.200 --> 03:09:56.309 align:start position:0%
area to teach that and they do that
freely

03:09:56.309 --> 03:09:56.319 align:start position:0%
freely
 
03:09:56.319 --> 03:09:57.349 align:start position:0%
freely
and

03:09:57.349 --> 03:09:57.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:09:58.550 --> 03:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
we should just make sure that that's
 
03:10:00.469 --> 03:10:00.479 align:start position:0%
allowed so i like that change um and
 
03:10:01.590 --> 03:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
then the last thing i just wanted to
 
03:10:03.429 --> 03:10:03.439 align:start position:0%
bring up is this equal treatment i have
 
03:10:05.510 --> 03:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
often heard of families and it's usually
 
03:10:06.950 --> 03:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
at the high school level
 
03:10:09.110 --> 03:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
going into a high school often treated
 
03:10:10.790 --> 03:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
very well and allowed to go in and be
 
03:10:12.070 --> 03:10:12.080 align:start position:0%
part of sports or after school
 
03:10:13.510 --> 03:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
activities my kids have done that and
 
03:10:15.030 --> 03:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
it's not been a problem
 
03:10:17.349 --> 03:10:17.359 align:start position:0%
but it's been quite shocking to hear
 
03:10:20.389 --> 03:10:20.399 align:start position:0%
schools seem to randomly decide that
 
03:10:21.750 --> 03:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
they're going to
 
03:10:24.150 --> 03:10:24.160 align:start position:0%
hold a family to a higher standard such
 
03:10:24.160 --> 03:10:25.030 align:start position:0%
hold a family to a higher standard such
as

03:10:25.030 --> 03:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
as
 
03:10:26.950 --> 03:10:26.960 align:start position:0%
we will only accept your child's
 
03:10:29.510 --> 03:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
progress for work for ninth grade if it
 
03:10:31.590 --> 03:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
came from an accredited school
 
03:10:33.429 --> 03:10:33.439 align:start position:0%
but in that same year that school
 
03:10:35.990 --> 03:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
accepted kids into
 
03:10:39.110 --> 03:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
that same grade 10th grade
 
03:10:42.070 --> 03:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
from districts in other states or in our
 
03:10:43.830 --> 03:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
state that we're not accredited so that
 
03:10:45.670 --> 03:10:45.680 align:start position:0%
was an unfair standard it was quite
 
03:10:47.830 --> 03:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
shocking for that family and
 
03:10:49.670 --> 03:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
i think that to ask school boards to
 
03:10:52.229 --> 03:10:52.239 align:start position:0%
make a policy is is not too much to ask
 
03:10:54.469 --> 03:10:54.479 align:start position:0%
i think overall it's going to save
 
03:10:56.550 --> 03:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
school board time it's going to save the
 
03:10:58.710 --> 03:10:58.720 align:start position:0%
administration time
 
03:11:00.229 --> 03:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
of the public schools it will save
 
03:11:02.150 --> 03:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
parents time so they will know if they
 
03:11:03.750 --> 03:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
want to access the curricular
 
03:11:05.750 --> 03:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
co-curricular activities how they can go
 
03:11:08.229 --> 03:11:08.239 align:start position:0%
about doing that and to know and have
 
03:11:10.150 --> 03:11:10.160 align:start position:0%
confidence that they will not be ignored
 
03:11:13.510 --> 03:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
and they will not be mistreated
 
03:11:15.590 --> 03:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
that's about your time okay thank you
 
03:11:17.269 --> 03:11:17.279 align:start position:0%
very much
 
03:11:31.750 --> 03:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:34.550 --> 03:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:36.469 --> 03:11:36.479 align:start position:0%
my name is deborah muirs i administer
 
03:11:38.070 --> 03:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
tri-city christian academy's
 
03:11:40.389 --> 03:11:40.399 align:start position:0%
participating agency program so i have a
 
03:11:42.389 --> 03:11:42.399 align:start position:0%
different perspective i am a home i also
 
03:11:44.950 --> 03:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
homeschool my son our school is located
 
03:11:47.429 --> 03:11:47.439 align:start position:0%
in somersworth i wanted to specifically
 
03:11:50.150 --> 03:11:50.160 align:start position:0%
address the requirements for termination
 
03:11:52.550 --> 03:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
the language needs to be changed when
 
03:11:54.870 --> 03:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
parents notify through our school and
 
03:11:58.150 --> 03:11:58.160 align:start position:0%
they do from all over the state
 
03:12:00.950 --> 03:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
their notification remains private
 
03:12:03.030 --> 03:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
we're only required to send statistics
 
03:12:05.590 --> 03:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
to the state in the october report it's
 
03:12:08.150 --> 03:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
inconsistent to require parents to send
 
03:12:09.910 --> 03:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
termination notification to the
 
03:12:12.150 --> 03:12:12.160 align:start position:0%
commissioner of education when that
 
03:12:14.790 --> 03:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
office holds no record of the family
 
03:12:16.630 --> 03:12:16.640 align:start position:0%
it should go to the chosen
 
03:12:19.110 --> 03:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
participating agency only one of the
 
03:12:21.269 --> 03:12:21.279 align:start position:0%
reasons that people choose our school is
 
03:12:23.670 --> 03:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
because we respect their privacy our
 
03:12:25.510 --> 03:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
letter of acknowledgement states that we
 
03:12:27.990 --> 03:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
do not give out any information
 
03:12:29.990 --> 03:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
without their consent
 
03:12:31.990 --> 03:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
i would like to see that this bill could
 
03:12:34.070 --> 03:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
clear up that inconsistency and
 
03:12:36.870 --> 03:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
hopefully an amendment has been or will
 
03:12:38.790 --> 03:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
be introduced to that end
 
03:12:39.750 --> 03:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:12:41.429 --> 03:12:41.439 align:start position:0%

elected body in the world for
 
03:14:21.990 --> 03:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
well no
 
03:14:25.030 --> 03:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
never has been so much asked for so many
 
03:14:27.349 --> 03:14:27.359 align:start position:0%
and given so little i know how much you
 
03:14:28.870 --> 03:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
don't make so i just want to commend you
 
03:14:31.030 --> 03:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
for your citizen service your true
 
03:14:33.590 --> 03:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
statesman and true citizen statement so
 
03:14:34.950 --> 03:14:34.960 align:start position:0%
just real quick hit on a couple things
 
03:14:35.990 --> 03:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
here you've heard about how
 
03:14:38.150 --> 03:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
homeschooling is just
 
03:14:39.670 --> 03:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
exploded in terms of growth and i think
 
03:14:40.950 --> 03:14:40.960 align:start position:0%
it's really great that you're looking at
 
03:14:42.790 --> 03:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
improving the homeschool law here and i
 
03:14:44.870 --> 03:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
want to support the ideas contained in
 
03:14:46.469 --> 03:14:46.479 align:start position:0%
representative leon's
 
03:14:49.590 --> 03:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
proposed bill here hb1663 some great
 
03:14:51.670 --> 03:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
ideas there are a few additional ideas i
 
03:14:53.910 --> 03:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
think that could um could be added to it
 
03:14:55.030 --> 03:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
and i believe she has prepared an
 
03:14:56.309 --> 03:14:56.319 align:start position:0%
amendment and i want to tell you that
 
03:14:57.750 --> 03:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
with those changes made by that
 
03:14:57.760 --> 03:14:58.790 align:start position:0%
with those changes made by that
amendment

03:14:58.790 --> 03:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:15:01.110 --> 03:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
uh our organization would support
 
03:15:03.670 --> 03:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
uh hb 1663 and i know you don't have it
 
03:15:05.110 --> 03:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
but i think you will soon hopefully one
 
03:15:06.309 --> 03:15:06.319 align:start position:0%
of you will introduce it and we would
 
03:15:07.670 --> 03:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
support that
 
03:15:09.670 --> 03:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
this bill would make make it easier for
 
03:15:11.269 --> 03:15:11.279 align:start position:0%
current homeschoolers new homeschoolers
 
03:15:13.349 --> 03:15:13.359 align:start position:0%
public administration officials like the
 
03:15:14.790 --> 03:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
department of education getting less
 
03:15:17.110 --> 03:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
information providing clarity to
 
03:15:18.710 --> 03:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
superintendents and others who deal with
 
03:15:20.070 --> 03:15:20.080 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers so i think it would do
 
03:15:22.150 --> 03:15:22.160 align:start position:0%
that when it comes to
 
03:15:23.110 --> 03:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
standardized tests i just want to
 
03:15:24.469 --> 03:15:24.479 align:start position:0%
address a question that was asked
 
03:15:26.630 --> 03:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
earlier once when students take the
 
03:15:28.870 --> 03:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
national tests they are sort of being
 
03:15:30.870 --> 03:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
assessed against new hampshire standards
 
03:15:32.389 --> 03:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
in as much as new hampshire has adopted
 
03:15:34.070 --> 03:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
state standards because these nationally
 
03:15:36.309 --> 03:15:36.319 align:start position:0%
norm standardized tests do you know test
 
03:15:37.990 --> 03:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
for those standards so i think that was
 
03:15:39.190 --> 03:15:39.200 align:start position:0%
a good question
 
03:15:41.269 --> 03:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
um i support all the other testimony
 
03:15:42.790 --> 03:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
regarding getting rid of them and i just
 
03:15:45.269 --> 03:15:45.279 align:start position:0%
by way of comparison give you a few
 
03:15:47.510 --> 03:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
other states that do require tests by
 
03:15:50.070 --> 03:15:50.080 align:start position:0%
the way most states do not most states
 
03:15:52.630 --> 03:15:52.640 align:start position:0%
do not require homeschoolers to do
 
03:15:54.630 --> 03:15:54.640 align:start position:0%
assessments or to submit assessments
 
03:15:56.469 --> 03:15:56.479 align:start position:0%
okay made that change back in 2012
 
03:15:58.309 --> 03:15:58.319 align:start position:0%
representative hull was actually the
 
03:16:00.790 --> 03:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
person who did that thank you jr
 
03:16:02.870 --> 03:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
but in colorado they set it at 13th
 
03:16:05.190 --> 03:16:05.200 align:start position:0%
percentile you have just about running
 
03:16:07.349 --> 03:16:07.359 align:start position:0%
out of time so and i'm wrapping up
 
03:16:09.429 --> 03:16:09.439 align:start position:0%
ohio's 25th percentile west virginia
 
03:16:11.110 --> 03:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
just made the change from 40th down to
 
03:16:12.790 --> 03:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
23rd percentile
 
03:16:14.790 --> 03:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
um we've long supported the removal of
 
03:16:16.389 --> 03:16:16.399 align:start position:0%
rulemaking authority from the commission
 
03:16:18.150 --> 03:16:18.160 align:start position:0%
of education you have a very good law
 
03:16:20.229 --> 03:16:20.239 align:start position:0%
it's very clear the commissioner does
 
03:16:21.429 --> 03:16:21.439 align:start position:0%
not need to make rules which is a
 
03:16:23.030 --> 03:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
tiresome cumbersome process so i would
 
03:16:24.790 --> 03:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
encourage you to take the opportunity to
 
03:16:26.389 --> 03:16:26.399 align:start position:0%
get rid of the rulemaking process which
 
03:16:27.750 --> 03:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
i believe is included in the amendment
 
03:16:29.510 --> 03:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
that representative leon has
 
03:16:31.190 --> 03:16:31.200 align:start position:0%
produced and i want to thank you for
 
03:16:32.469 --> 03:16:32.479 align:start position:0%
your kind attention
 
03:16:35.190 --> 03:16:35.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
03:16:44.070 --> 03:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:46.150 --> 03:16:46.160 align:start position:0%
that your mother that spoke earlier or
 
03:16:48.630 --> 03:16:48.640 align:start position:0%
yes it is
 
03:16:50.309 --> 03:16:50.319 align:start position:0%
i'll be quick and brief for the sake of
 
03:16:53.110 --> 03:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
time hello my name is alyssa and i've
 
03:16:54.710 --> 03:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
been homeschooled all my life in new
 
03:16:56.229 --> 03:16:56.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire i don't believe that
 
03:16:57.990 --> 03:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers should be held to a higher
 
03:16:59.990 --> 03:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
standard than other students
 
03:17:02.229 --> 03:17:02.239 align:start position:0%
and there should be special protections
 
03:17:05.429 --> 03:17:05.439 align:start position:0%
for those with educational differences
 
03:17:08.309 --> 03:17:08.319 align:start position:0%
and also not with different diagnosis
 
03:17:09.990 --> 03:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
but also for instance what if one
 
03:17:12.229 --> 03:17:12.239 align:start position:0%
student has english skills that surpass
 
03:17:14.070 --> 03:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
their age level but that they struggle
 
03:17:16.309 --> 03:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
with mathematics it would be extremely
 
03:17:18.309 --> 03:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
beneficial to that student to have
 
03:17:20.389 --> 03:17:20.399 align:start position:0%
advanced education in the english that
 
03:17:21.590 --> 03:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
they desire
 
03:17:23.830 --> 03:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
in addition to getting the extra help
 
03:17:25.830 --> 03:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
they need in mathematics this would
 
03:17:27.510 --> 03:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
allow them to grow to their full
 
03:17:29.190 --> 03:17:29.200 align:start position:0%
academic potential
 
03:17:31.429 --> 03:17:31.439 align:start position:0%
it would also be extremely helpful to
 
03:17:33.269 --> 03:17:33.279 align:start position:0%
have equal access to
 
03:17:35.269 --> 03:17:35.279 align:start position:0%
the public schools to be able to borrow
 
03:17:38.469 --> 03:17:38.479 align:start position:0%
instruments and other useful materials
 
03:17:40.630 --> 03:17:40.640 align:start position:0%
this would highly enrich my education
 
03:17:42.870 --> 03:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
for instance i have wanted to borrow
 
03:17:44.870 --> 03:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
musical instruments before from my local
 
03:17:47.190 --> 03:17:47.200 align:start position:0%
public school but have been denied
 
03:17:49.030 --> 03:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
homeschooling has been a great blessing
 
03:17:50.950 --> 03:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
for me to explore and expand on my
 
03:17:53.349 --> 03:17:53.359 align:start position:0%
various gifts and abilities while also
 
03:17:55.990 --> 03:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
strengthening my academic difficulties
 
03:17:59.750 --> 03:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
please pass hb 1663 to continue to allow
 
03:18:02.229 --> 03:18:02.239 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers to have the best education
 
03:18:04.070 --> 03:18:04.080 align:start position:0%

off by
 
04:46:13.590 --> 04:46:13.600 align:start position:0%
45 minutes or so and it's a result of a
 
04:46:15.350 --> 04:46:15.360 align:start position:0%
whole lot of issues where things been

bumped around and i do apologize

04:46:36.390 --> 04:46:36.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
04:46:39.110 --> 04:46:39.120 align:start position:0%
i'm carol mcguire representing merrimack
 
04:46:42.150 --> 04:46:42.160 align:start position:0%
district 29 which is allenstown epsom in
 
04:46:42.160 --> 04:46:43.670 align:start position:0%
district 29 which is allenstown epsom in
pittsfield

04:46:43.670 --> 04:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
pittsfield
 
04:46:46.830 --> 04:46:46.840 align:start position:0%
this bill started as a constituent
 
04:46:50.070 --> 04:46:50.080 align:start position:0%
question she runs a business supplying
 
04:46:52.470 --> 04:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
occupational therapists to the schools
 
04:46:55.110 --> 04:46:55.120 align:start position:0%
mostly for special ed students
 
04:46:57.750 --> 04:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
and they support a good number of
 
04:47:00.628 --> 04:47:00.638 align:start position:0%
schools because
 
04:47:02.310 --> 04:47:02.320 align:start position:0%
around here there's plenty of them with
 
04:47:04.788 --> 04:47:04.798 align:start position:0%
an easy commuting distance
 
04:47:08.470 --> 04:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
and she asked me why they had to get a
 
04:47:10.948 --> 04:47:10.958 align:start position:0%
separate criminal records check for
 
04:47:13.110 --> 04:47:13.120 align:start position:0%
every school
 
04:47:15.590 --> 04:47:15.600 align:start position:0%
and i said that seems bizarre and i went
 
04:47:17.590 --> 04:47:17.600 align:start position:0%
and looked into it
 
04:47:19.990 --> 04:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
it turned out it's a combination of
 
04:47:22.230 --> 04:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
different laws and rules that causes the
 
04:47:22.240 --> 04:47:23.750 align:start position:0%
different laws and rules that causes the
trouble

04:47:23.750 --> 04:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
trouble
 
04:47:23.760 --> 04:47:24.708 align:start position:0%
trouble
the

04:47:24.708 --> 04:47:24.718 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:47:27.110 --> 04:47:27.120 align:start position:0%
education statutes require everybody who
 
04:47:29.190 --> 04:47:29.200 align:start position:0%
works in the school to have a criminal
 
04:47:30.708 --> 04:47:30.718 align:start position:0%
records check
 
04:47:33.350 --> 04:47:33.360 align:start position:0%
and it says that once such a check is
 
04:47:35.190 --> 04:47:35.200 align:start position:0%
delivered to the school
 
04:47:36.788 --> 04:47:36.798 align:start position:0%
it is reviewed
 
04:47:36.798 --> 04:47:37.830 align:start position:0%
it is reviewed
the

04:47:37.830 --> 04:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:47:40.310 --> 04:47:40.320 align:start position:0%
decision to hire or not is made and then
 
04:47:40.320 --> 04:47:42.788 align:start position:0%
decision to hire or not is made and then
the

04:47:42.788 --> 04:47:42.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:46.470 --> 04:47:46.480 align:start position:0%
the records the data is destroyed
 
04:47:48.868 --> 04:47:48.878 align:start position:0%
for privacy reasons
 
04:47:51.590 --> 04:47:51.600 align:start position:0%
the department of safety which conducts
 
04:47:54.708 --> 04:47:54.718 align:start position:0%
our criminal records checks
 
04:47:57.350 --> 04:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
can only release them to government
 
04:48:00.230 --> 04:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
entities without specific
 
04:48:02.310 --> 04:48:02.320 align:start position:0%
authorization at least that's what i was
 
04:48:02.320 --> 04:48:03.430 align:start position:0%
authorization at least that's what i was
told

04:48:03.430 --> 04:48:03.440 align:start position:0%
told
 
04:48:04.628 --> 04:48:04.638 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:48:07.350 --> 04:48:07.360 align:start position:0%
it ends up that if you want to
 
04:48:09.030 --> 04:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
work in the morning at
 
04:48:11.190 --> 04:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
deerfield elementary school and in the
 
04:48:12.868 --> 04:48:12.878 align:start position:0%
afternoon and the epsom school which are
 
04:48:15.590 --> 04:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
like five or ten miles apart you need to
 
04:48:17.510 --> 04:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
have a separate criminal records check
 
04:48:19.110 --> 04:48:19.120 align:start position:0%
for each school
 
04:48:20.788 --> 04:48:20.798 align:start position:0%
and if tomorrow you're going on to
 
04:48:23.590 --> 04:48:23.600 align:start position:0%
pembroke there's a third one
 
04:48:24.948 --> 04:48:24.958 align:start position:0%
this struck me
 
04:48:27.590 --> 04:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
as extremely inefficient
 
04:48:29.270 --> 04:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
and the more i looked into it the more
 
04:48:31.510 --> 04:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
snarled it looked
 
04:48:34.150 --> 04:48:34.160 align:start position:0%
and so i decided that this is one of the
 
04:48:36.070 --> 04:48:36.080 align:start position:0%
few cases where a committee is
 
04:48:39.430 --> 04:48:39.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate because the information and
 
04:48:41.670 --> 04:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
the contacts and the understanding of
 
04:48:42.788 --> 04:48:42.798 align:start position:0%
the issues
 
04:48:45.190 --> 04:48:45.200 align:start position:0%
is not in one committee i mean i've got
 
04:48:47.510 --> 04:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
a bill in my committee that might have
 
04:48:49.510 --> 04:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
been a study committee but we're going
 
04:48:51.830 --> 04:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
to interrupt study it because we have
 
04:48:52.868 --> 04:48:52.878 align:start position:0%
all the in
 
04:48:55.270 --> 04:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
the skills and the contacts we need this
 
04:48:57.590 --> 04:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
one needs somebody with an education
 
04:48:59.590 --> 04:48:59.600 align:start position:0%
background and somebody who knows
 
04:49:01.190 --> 04:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
something about licensing and something
 
04:49:03.190 --> 04:49:03.200 align:start position:0%
about criminal records checks
 
04:49:05.190 --> 04:49:05.200 align:start position:0%
so that's those are the people that i
 
04:49:08.310 --> 04:49:08.320 align:start position:0%
asked to be on the committee
 
04:49:10.788 --> 04:49:10.798 align:start position:0%
the first thing is that i don't know
 
04:49:13.110 --> 04:49:13.120 align:start position:0%
which other professions
 
04:49:16.150 --> 04:49:16.160 align:start position:0%
are working in the schools and
 
04:49:18.708 --> 04:49:18.718 align:start position:0%
likely to work in more than one school
 
04:49:20.708 --> 04:49:20.718 align:start position:0%
i mean your basic teacher doesn't they
 
04:49:22.470 --> 04:49:22.480 align:start position:0%
they work in one school
 
04:49:22.480 --> 04:49:23.430 align:start position:0%
they work in one school
but

04:49:23.430 --> 04:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:49:25.990 --> 04:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
the professionals who support special ed
 
04:49:26.000 --> 04:49:27.510 align:start position:0%
the professionals who support special ed
services

04:49:27.510 --> 04:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
services
 
04:49:29.750 --> 04:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
may not be needed full-time in a small
 
04:49:29.760 --> 04:49:30.628 align:start position:0%
may not be needed full-time in a small
school

04:49:30.628 --> 04:49:30.638 align:start position:0%
school
 
04:49:33.110 --> 04:49:33.120 align:start position:0%
so they will work in more than one and
 
04:49:35.030 --> 04:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
around here that's easy enough because
 
04:49:37.510 --> 04:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
there's you know plenty of schools to
 
04:49:40.550 --> 04:49:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:42.868 --> 04:49:42.878 align:start position:0%
so we would need to want to find out
 
04:49:45.750 --> 04:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
who's who's affected how often they move
 
04:49:48.150 --> 04:49:48.160 align:start position:0%
how many schools they work on
 
04:49:50.230 --> 04:49:50.240 align:start position:0%
and what other what else we could do
 
04:49:52.070 --> 04:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
other than a
 
04:49:55.350 --> 04:49:55.360 align:start position:0%
department of safety fbi records check
 
04:49:57.270 --> 04:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
because there are some professions i
 
04:49:59.670 --> 04:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
believe or at least i was told by by the
 
04:50:01.350 --> 04:50:01.360 align:start position:0%
department of education
 
04:50:03.270 --> 04:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
that the professional organization
 
04:50:05.270 --> 04:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
certifies these people are okay to work
 
04:50:07.430 --> 04:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
in schools
 
04:50:09.350 --> 04:50:09.360 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if that's true in new
 
04:50:11.270 --> 04:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire or it's only in in
 
04:50:13.430 --> 04:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
massachusetts or wherever they were
 
04:50:16.230 --> 04:50:16.240 align:start position:0%
talking about but it's an idea
 
04:50:18.550 --> 04:50:18.560 align:start position:0%
you know if you you could have a
 
04:50:18.560 --> 04:50:19.510 align:start position:0%
you know if you you could have a
uh

04:50:19.510 --> 04:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:50:21.350 --> 04:50:21.360 align:start position:0%
the professional organization of speech
 
04:50:23.350 --> 04:50:23.360 align:start position:0%
language pathologists that you know
 
04:50:25.750 --> 04:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
anybody who had the license is blessed
 
04:50:27.750 --> 04:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
and certified and has passed
 
04:50:29.670 --> 04:50:29.680 align:start position:0%
has no criminal record and is safe to
 
04:50:31.030 --> 04:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
work in schools
 
04:50:32.628 --> 04:50:32.638 align:start position:0%
it's an option i don't know that for
 
04:50:32.638 --> 04:50:33.750 align:start position:0%
it's an option i don't know that for
sure

04:50:33.750 --> 04:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
sure
 
04:50:35.270 --> 04:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
i do know that the department of
 
04:50:38.070 --> 04:50:38.080 align:start position:0%
education set this up for school drivers
 
04:50:39.670 --> 04:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
and transport
 
04:50:41.590 --> 04:50:41.600 align:start position:0%
operators because they
 
04:50:43.110 --> 04:50:43.120 align:start position:0%
also work
 
04:50:45.750 --> 04:50:45.760 align:start position:0%
for other more than one school
 
04:50:49.510 --> 04:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
and it was a royal hassle for them
 
04:50:51.430 --> 04:50:51.440 align:start position:0%
and so the department of education
 
04:50:53.350 --> 04:50:53.360 align:start position:0%
started running the
 
04:50:55.110 --> 04:50:55.120 align:start position:0%
collecting the background check data and
 
04:50:56.868 --> 04:50:56.878 align:start position:0%
saying you know these
 
04:50:59.590 --> 04:50:59.600 align:start position:0%
bus drivers and transportation monitors
 
04:51:02.708 --> 04:51:02.718 align:start position:0%
are good are good to go to any school
 
04:51:04.708 --> 04:51:04.718 align:start position:0%
and so that's
 
04:51:09.990 --> 04:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:12.230 --> 04:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
i'll answer whatever questions i can
 
04:51:13.350 --> 04:51:13.360 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
04:51:15.830 --> 04:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
mcguire are there any questions from the
 
04:51:15.840 --> 04:51:20.868 align:start position:0%
mcguire are there any questions from the
committee

04:51:20.868 --> 04:51:20.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:22.708 --> 04:51:22.718 align:start position:0%
representative porter
 
04:51:23.990 --> 04:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
04:51:26.150 --> 04:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire so this morning i
 
04:51:28.310 --> 04:51:28.320 align:start position:0%
introduced a bill that would require
 
04:51:30.788 --> 04:51:30.798 align:start position:0%
education service providers who are
 
04:51:33.350 --> 04:51:33.360 align:start position:0%
receiving efa accounts and others
 
04:51:34.868 --> 04:51:34.878 align:start position:0%
receiving public money to have
 
04:51:37.190 --> 04:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
background checks would you would those
 
04:51:39.830 --> 04:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
people be able to utilize this you think
 
04:51:40.708 --> 04:51:40.718 align:start position:0%
if you
 
04:51:42.948 --> 04:51:42.958 align:start position:0%
um it went through that's why we have to
 
04:51:45.670 --> 04:51:45.680 align:start position:0%
study it representative porter i do know
 
04:51:45.680 --> 04:51:46.708 align:start position:0%
study it representative porter i do know
that

04:51:46.708 --> 04:51:46.718 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:51:49.510 --> 04:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
the background check procedure
 
04:51:52.230 --> 04:51:52.240 align:start position:0%
is being used much more intensely these
 
04:51:54.070 --> 04:51:54.080 align:start position:0%
days than it used to be
 
04:51:56.150 --> 04:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
and it is frequently a bottleneck for
 
04:51:57.830 --> 04:51:57.840 align:start position:0%
other professionals
 
04:52:00.550 --> 04:52:00.560 align:start position:0%
and if a somebody needs to get five
 
04:52:02.150 --> 04:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
background checks
 
04:52:05.190 --> 04:52:05.200 align:start position:0%
to go around to the local schools
 
04:52:05.200 --> 04:52:06.150 align:start position:0%
to go around to the local schools
that's

04:52:06.150 --> 04:52:06.160 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:52:07.750 --> 04:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
four other people that couldn't get a
 
04:52:07.760 --> 04:52:10.948 align:start position:0%
four other people that couldn't get a
clearance

04:52:10.948 --> 04:52:10.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:14.788 --> 04:52:14.798 align:start position:0%
further questions of carol mcguire
 
04:52:17.670 --> 04:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
representative litchfield
 
04:52:18.628 --> 04:52:18.638 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:52:20.070 --> 04:52:20.080 align:start position:0%
would you believe we were just
 
04:52:21.990 --> 04:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
discussing this literally a few days ago
 
04:52:23.590 --> 04:52:23.600 align:start position:0%
to school board meeting
 
04:52:26.230 --> 04:52:26.240 align:start position:0%
where we have an issue with subs we
 
04:52:28.150 --> 04:52:28.160 align:start position:0%
could use a centralized location for
 
04:52:30.470 --> 04:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
substitutes because we have a shortage
 
04:52:32.150 --> 04:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
and boy this would really simplify
 
04:52:33.510 --> 04:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
things yes
 
04:52:35.750 --> 04:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
i'm sure i don't i'm not involved with
 
04:52:38.230 --> 04:52:38.240 align:start position:0%
schools very much so i don't know which
 
04:52:40.470 --> 04:52:40.480 align:start position:0%
professions you would need need or want
 
04:52:42.390 --> 04:52:42.400 align:start position:0%
to have a centralized
 
04:52:45.270 --> 04:52:45.280 align:start position:0%
database on but i'm sure that it could
 
04:52:47.350 --> 04:52:47.360 align:start position:0%
be very useful
 
04:52:50.230 --> 04:52:50.240 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
04:52:53.670 --> 04:52:53.680 align:start position:0%
representative yes representative waltz
 
04:52:55.350 --> 04:52:55.360 align:start position:0%
thank you so
 
04:52:56.948 --> 04:52:56.958 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to remember and we've heard a
 
04:52:58.550 --> 04:52:58.560 align:start position:0%
lot of bills but my recollection is
 
04:53:00.868 --> 04:53:00.878 align:start position:0%
we've had testimony that the department
 
04:53:02.628 --> 04:53:02.638 align:start position:0%
of education is starting a centralized
 
04:53:04.470 --> 04:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
database for things like school bus
 
04:53:07.030 --> 04:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
drivers and some other support people is
 
04:53:09.190 --> 04:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
there any reason they can't do this for
 
04:53:11.270 --> 04:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
teachers and subs and
 
04:53:13.510 --> 04:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
uh we have to authorize them too or tell
 
04:53:15.030 --> 04:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
them to
 
04:53:17.830 --> 04:53:17.840 align:start position:0%
so could we instead of studying this
 
04:53:20.070 --> 04:53:20.080 align:start position:0%
it appears that we sorry follow-up
 
04:53:22.230 --> 04:53:22.240 align:start position:0%
that's fine instead of instead of
 
04:53:23.590 --> 04:53:23.600 align:start position:0%
studying this wouldn't it make more
 
04:53:25.350 --> 04:53:25.360 align:start position:0%
sense just to amend this bill to tell
 
04:53:27.270 --> 04:53:27.280 align:start position:0%
them to do that and have a centralized
 
04:53:29.990 --> 04:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
base for everybody so that we can have
 
04:53:31.510 --> 04:53:31.520 align:start position:0%
all background checks and everybody has
 
04:53:34.310 --> 04:53:34.320 align:start position:0%
access to it if you know all the pr all
 
04:53:37.190 --> 04:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
the peop professions that need to be
 
04:53:38.708 --> 04:53:38.718 align:start position:0%
included in that
 
04:53:41.030 --> 04:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
instruction go i'd love to i would
 
04:53:43.030 --> 04:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
certainly support it but i don't know
 
04:53:44.868 --> 04:53:44.878 align:start position:0%
who who's working in the schools other
 
04:53:44.878 --> 04:53:45.670 align:start position:0%
who who's working in the schools other
than

04:53:45.670 --> 04:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
than
 
04:53:50.310 --> 04:53:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:52.230 --> 04:53:52.240 align:start position:0%
further further questions
 
04:53:54.470 --> 04:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
we do have the department here so we can
 
04:53:56.150 --> 04:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
get some technical advice there we've
 
04:53:59.110 --> 04:53:59.120 align:start position:0%
been seeking it from our
 
04:54:02.150 --> 04:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
our governor back there
 
04:54:06.868 --> 04:54:06.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:07.910 --> 04:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
well we'll
 
04:54:10.628 --> 04:54:10.638 align:start position:0%
we'll elevate you then the full kernel
 
04:54:12.788 --> 04:54:12.798 align:start position:0%
so at this point there's no more
 
04:54:14.230 --> 04:54:14.240 align:start position:0%
questions we'll
 
04:54:17.350 --> 04:54:17.360 align:start position:0%
move on to the next person which we have
 
04:54:19.300 --> 04:54:19.310 align:start position:0%
uh here and we're going to get
 
04:54:19.310 --> 04:54:22.390 align:start position:0%
uh here and we're going to get
[Music]

04:54:22.390 --> 04:54:22.400 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:54:23.990 --> 04:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
let's get uh our new hampshire state
 
04:54:27.110 --> 04:54:27.120 align:start position:0%
police up here uh victor
 
04:54:32.310 --> 04:54:32.320 align:start position:0%
is it m-u-z-z-e-y yes sir muzzy welcome
 
04:54:34.310 --> 04:54:34.320 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and thank you members
 
04:54:36.550 --> 04:54:36.560 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is victor muzzy
 
04:54:38.708 --> 04:54:38.718 align:start position:0%
i am a lieutenant at the state police in
 
04:54:40.550 --> 04:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
charge of record information services
 
04:54:42.230 --> 04:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
which includes the
 
04:54:45.190 --> 04:54:45.200 align:start position:0%
criminal records unit i'm here
 
04:54:47.670 --> 04:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
this afternoon to just offer a couple of
 
04:54:49.670 --> 04:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
points i suppose first of all i think
 
04:54:51.110 --> 04:54:51.120 align:start position:0%
the department of safety would be in
 
04:54:51.120 --> 04:54:52.310 align:start position:0%
the department of safety would be in
support

04:54:52.310 --> 04:54:52.320 align:start position:0%
support
 
04:54:54.948 --> 04:54:54.958 align:start position:0%
of this bill to form a committee
 
04:54:56.788 --> 04:54:56.798 align:start position:0%
to study these items which i think we
 
04:54:59.110 --> 04:54:59.120 align:start position:0%
would agree any any way to alleviate
 
04:55:00.708 --> 04:55:00.718 align:start position:0%
backlog and make things more efficient
 
04:55:03.270 --> 04:55:03.280 align:start position:0%
of course we would be in support of that
 
04:55:05.750 --> 04:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
really our only concern
 
04:55:07.830 --> 04:55:07.840 align:start position:0%
would be is
 
04:55:09.510 --> 04:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
i suppose making sure the committee is
 
04:55:11.590 --> 04:55:11.600 align:start position:0%
aware of
 
04:55:13.430 --> 04:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of the requirements that we we
 
04:55:15.030 --> 04:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
would fall under for things like
 
04:55:16.948 --> 04:55:16.958 align:start position:0%
disseminating background checks and how
 
04:55:19.590 --> 04:55:19.600 align:start position:0%
those go to different places and
 
04:55:21.750 --> 04:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
is at the hands of the fbi and
 
04:55:23.750 --> 04:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
controlled by them so
 
04:55:26.150 --> 04:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
as we saw with the bus drivers and bus
 
04:55:26.160 --> 04:55:27.670 align:start position:0%
as we saw with the bus drivers and bus
monitors

04:55:27.670 --> 04:55:27.680 align:start position:0%
monitors
 
04:55:29.590 --> 04:55:29.600 align:start position:0%
we had a little issue there where we had
 
04:55:31.750 --> 04:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
to reach out for the fbi's say so even
 
04:55:33.910 --> 04:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
though a law was enacted by the state
 
04:55:36.070 --> 04:55:36.080 align:start position:0%
um dissemination of that was was really
 
04:55:37.990 --> 04:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
up to them because it contained sigis
 
04:55:40.070 --> 04:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
information so
 
04:55:42.230 --> 04:55:42.240 align:start position:0%
that's really i think our only concern
 
04:55:44.070 --> 04:55:44.080 align:start position:0%
is making sure that the study
 
04:55:46.550 --> 04:55:46.560 align:start position:0%
understands or the committee i'm sorry
 
04:55:49.350 --> 04:55:49.360 align:start position:0%
the committee understands
 
04:55:50.948 --> 04:55:50.958 align:start position:0%
in researching what need be done to
 
04:55:52.470 --> 04:55:52.480 align:start position:0%
determine how we can disseminate these
 
04:55:54.150 --> 04:55:54.160 align:start position:0%
things that a lot of this is at the say
 
04:55:55.670 --> 04:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
so of the fbi
 
04:55:57.270 --> 04:55:57.280 align:start position:0%
and furthermore the other point that i
 
04:55:58.868 --> 04:55:58.878 align:start position:0%
will make here is
 
04:56:00.390 --> 04:56:00.400 align:start position:0%
line number
 
04:56:03.350 --> 04:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
20 talks about the availability of other
 
04:56:05.990 --> 04:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
background clearance procedures
 
04:56:07.750 --> 04:56:07.760 align:start position:0%
and i don't know exactly what the
 
04:56:10.390 --> 04:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
language and that may refer to but
 
04:56:12.470 --> 04:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
if it's in reference to potentially
 
04:56:14.550 --> 04:56:14.560 align:start position:0%
doing third party background checks or
 
04:56:16.390 --> 04:56:16.400 align:start position:0%
things like that
 
04:56:17.830 --> 04:56:17.840 align:start position:0%
certainly that's that's not a decision
 
04:56:19.910 --> 04:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
for the department of safety to make but
 
04:56:21.670 --> 04:56:21.680 align:start position:0%
just to make members of this committee
 
04:56:23.350 --> 04:56:23.360 align:start position:0%
or the committee formed as a result of
 
04:56:25.190 --> 04:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
the bill aware of what you would be
 
04:56:27.670 --> 04:56:27.680 align:start position:0%
getting in regards to that check versus
 
04:56:29.270 --> 04:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
what you wouldn't be getting just as an
 
04:56:31.430 --> 04:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
educational piece so
 
04:56:33.030 --> 04:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
i guess that's really what i can offer
 
04:56:35.670 --> 04:56:35.680 align:start position:0%
you in the way of testimony we support
 
04:56:37.590 --> 04:56:37.600 align:start position:0%
the idea of it and certainly the
 
04:56:39.510 --> 04:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
efficiency of i think the intent of the
 
04:56:41.590 --> 04:56:41.600 align:start position:0%
bill it's just a function of the
 
04:56:42.948 --> 04:56:42.958 align:start position:0%
logistics of
 
04:56:44.310 --> 04:56:44.320 align:start position:0%
carrying out whatever the committee
 
04:56:46.230 --> 04:56:46.240 align:start position:0%
determines and that has a making sure
 
04:56:48.070 --> 04:56:48.080 align:start position:0%
they have a full understanding
 
04:56:50.230 --> 04:56:50.240 align:start position:0%
of the confines of which we may have to
 
04:56:52.070 --> 04:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
operate under
 
04:56:53.670 --> 04:56:53.680 align:start position:0%
okay happy to take any and all questions
 
04:56:56.070 --> 04:56:56.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much lieutenant um
 
04:56:57.910 --> 04:56:57.920 align:start position:0%
are there any questions here
 
04:56:59.670 --> 04:56:59.680 align:start position:0%
yes represent woodcock thank you
 
04:56:59.680 --> 04:57:02.628 align:start position:0%
yes represent woodcock thank you
chairman

04:57:02.628 --> 04:57:02.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:07.430 --> 04:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:09.110 --> 04:57:09.120 align:start position:0%
i'll try again thank you representative
 
04:57:11.110 --> 04:57:11.120 align:start position:0%
thank you sir um i have two questions
 
04:57:12.310 --> 04:57:12.320 align:start position:0%
the first one is
 
04:57:14.628 --> 04:57:14.638 align:start position:0%
is there anything that that um in your
 
04:57:16.628 --> 04:57:16.638 align:start position:0%
mind that would
 
04:57:18.150 --> 04:57:18.160 align:start position:0%
having dealt with all these
 
04:57:21.110 --> 04:57:21.120 align:start position:0%
certifications and checks uh that would
 
04:57:24.390 --> 04:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
prohibit uh or require or why does it
 
04:57:26.868 --> 04:57:26.878 align:start position:0%
require schools
 
04:57:28.708 --> 04:57:28.718 align:start position:0%
using the same certified person to
 
04:57:30.788 --> 04:57:30.798 align:start position:0%
require multiple checks for example
 
04:57:32.868 --> 04:57:32.878 align:start position:0%
school i'm a i'm a coaching school a a
 
04:57:34.708 --> 04:57:34.718 align:start position:0%
teacher in school b and i
 
04:57:35.990 --> 04:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
i you know wash windows there on a
 
04:57:37.990 --> 04:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
sunday school city i still have to have
 
04:57:38.000 --> 04:57:38.868 align:start position:0%
sunday school city i still have to have
a

04:57:38.868 --> 04:57:38.878 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:57:41.350 --> 04:57:41.360 align:start position:0%
from all three although i'm a certified
 
04:57:42.390 --> 04:57:42.400 align:start position:0%
cleared one
 
04:57:44.150 --> 04:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
yeah and i don't have a real good answer
 
04:57:45.430 --> 04:57:45.440 align:start position:0%
for that that maybe somebody in the room
 
04:57:47.030 --> 04:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
better suited to answer that question
 
04:57:48.310 --> 04:57:48.320 align:start position:0%
for me
 
04:57:50.868 --> 04:57:50.878 align:start position:0%
or for you
 
04:57:52.788 --> 04:57:52.798 align:start position:0%
i guess it's a function of who's vetting
 
04:57:54.628 --> 04:57:54.638 align:start position:0%
the candidate and i think as it stands
 
04:57:56.070 --> 04:57:56.080 align:start position:0%
now that's on
 
04:57:58.310 --> 04:57:58.320 align:start position:0%
a district level for some things and
 
04:57:59.910 --> 04:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
certainly the school administrative unit
 
04:58:01.750 --> 04:58:01.760 align:start position:0%
for others so i think it's a function of
 
04:58:04.070 --> 04:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
maybe aligning those two things to allow
 
04:58:05.910 --> 04:58:05.920 align:start position:0%
for that flexibility
 
04:58:07.430 --> 04:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
but as it's written my understanding is
 
04:58:09.430 --> 04:58:09.440 align:start position:0%
that authority to vet a candidate for a
 
04:58:10.948 --> 04:58:10.958 align:start position:0%
particular position or role in the
 
04:58:12.708 --> 04:58:12.718 align:start position:0%
school comes from
 
04:58:16.150 --> 04:58:16.160 align:start position:0%
that building administrator or or um
 
04:58:17.670 --> 04:58:17.680 align:start position:0%
person responsible for that that
 
04:58:17.680 --> 04:58:19.190 align:start position:0%
person responsible for that that
facility

04:58:19.190 --> 04:58:19.200 align:start position:0%
facility
 
04:58:20.948 --> 04:58:20.958 align:start position:0%
hey follow up yes go ahead thank you
 
04:58:22.868 --> 04:58:22.878 align:start position:0%
chairman um so
 
04:58:25.030 --> 04:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
based on what you just said on the who's
 
04:58:25.990 --> 04:58:26.000 align:start position:0%
vetting it
 
04:58:28.470 --> 04:58:28.480 align:start position:0%
if they're all vetting for
 
04:58:30.948 --> 04:58:30.958 align:start position:0%
professional functions within the school
 
04:58:32.788 --> 04:58:32.798 align:start position:0%
uh athletic department through the
 
04:58:34.470 --> 04:58:34.480 align:start position:0%
department science department at three
 
04:58:36.310 --> 04:58:36.320 align:start position:0%
different schools um so they're all
 
04:58:38.628 --> 04:58:38.638 align:start position:0%
vetting for a school district with the
 
04:58:40.310 --> 04:58:40.320 align:start position:0%
background check that your organization
 
04:58:42.470 --> 04:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
does is the same background check
 
04:58:44.628 --> 04:58:44.638 align:start position:0%
because they're all school district
 
04:58:46.070 --> 04:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
or will be so many different regions
 
04:58:47.750 --> 04:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
well the process is exactly the same
 
04:58:49.270 --> 04:58:49.280 align:start position:0%
it's just a function of when the check
 
04:58:50.230 --> 04:58:50.240 align:start position:0%
is done
 
04:58:51.750 --> 04:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
so for example you could have somebody
 
04:58:53.270 --> 04:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
that's got a clean record today but
 
04:58:55.350 --> 04:58:55.360 align:start position:0%
tomorrow they commit a crime or get
 
04:58:56.948 --> 04:58:56.958 align:start position:0%
convicted of a crime and then you know
 
04:58:59.190 --> 04:58:59.200 align:start position:0%
you've got however much time passes so
 
04:59:00.470 --> 04:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
the record would be updated and
 
04:59:00.480 --> 04:59:01.590 align:start position:0%
the record would be updated and
refreshed

04:59:01.590 --> 04:59:01.600 align:start position:0%
refreshed
 
04:59:01.600 --> 04:59:02.470 align:start position:0%
refreshed
um

04:59:02.470 --> 04:59:02.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:04.470 --> 04:59:04.480 align:start position:0%
so the process is exactly the same for
 
04:59:06.070 --> 04:59:06.080 align:start position:0%
all of those
 
04:59:07.990 --> 04:59:08.000 align:start position:0%
units if you will okay but it's just a
 
04:59:10.390 --> 04:59:10.400 align:start position:0%
function of again it's what it is today
 
04:59:12.390 --> 04:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
may not be what it will be tomorrow
 
04:59:14.230 --> 04:59:14.240 align:start position:0%
okay thank you mr
 
04:59:18.070 --> 04:59:18.080 align:start position:0%
thank you sir further questions
 
04:59:20.230 --> 04:59:20.240 align:start position:0%
yes representative nelson thank you mr
 
04:59:21.830 --> 04:59:21.840 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
04:59:21.840 --> 04:59:23.590 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
question

04:59:23.590 --> 04:59:23.600 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:59:25.350 --> 04:59:25.360 align:start position:0%
what do they review
 
04:59:27.590 --> 04:59:27.600 align:start position:0%
checks on teachers or someone doing
 
04:59:29.270 --> 04:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
something like this so if i'm a teacher
 
04:59:30.868 --> 04:59:30.878 align:start position:0%
you run the background
 
04:59:32.628 --> 04:59:32.638 align:start position:0%
check i'm all set but do you go over
 
04:59:34.470 --> 04:59:34.480 align:start position:0%
like every year to check it out to make
 
04:59:35.670 --> 04:59:35.680 align:start position:0%
sure i haven't done anything bad in
 
04:59:37.990 --> 04:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
between we do the state the department
 
04:59:39.750 --> 04:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
of safety doesn't do that we provide
 
04:59:42.070 --> 04:59:42.080 align:start position:0%
simply provide the record pursuant to
 
04:59:43.990 --> 04:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
statute and rule to
 
04:59:45.270 --> 04:59:45.280 align:start position:0%
whomever that
 
04:59:46.868 --> 04:59:46.878 align:start position:0%
body may be the school administrative
 
04:59:48.230 --> 04:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
unit so
 
04:59:49.590 --> 04:59:49.600 align:start position:0%
we're just the keeper of the record and
 
04:59:53.430 --> 04:59:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:53.440 --> 04:59:54.470 align:start position:0%
 
other

04:59:54.470 --> 04:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:59:54.480 --> 04:59:58.150 align:start position:0%
other
questions

04:59:58.150 --> 04:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:00.390 --> 05:00:00.400 align:start position:0%
over there oh representative porter yeah
 
05:00:02.708 --> 05:00:02.718 align:start position:0%
but i i might know the answer already so
 
05:00:05.430 --> 05:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
i'll be brief so the records that you
 
05:00:07.350 --> 05:00:07.360 align:start position:0%
send out to the school districts are
 
05:00:09.190 --> 05:00:09.200 align:start position:0%
detailed records yes ma'am they're not
 
05:00:11.990 --> 05:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
just superficial correct okay if you
 
05:00:14.868 --> 05:00:14.878 align:start position:0%
were to send those to say the department
 
05:00:16.390 --> 05:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
of education
 
05:00:18.470 --> 05:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
and they looked them over could
 
05:00:20.708 --> 05:00:20.718 align:start position:0%
they only send a
 
05:00:23.750 --> 05:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
cast or failed to
 
05:00:25.990 --> 05:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
somebody or would they be required do
 
05:00:28.470 --> 05:00:28.480 align:start position:0%
you think to send the whole
 
05:00:28.480 --> 05:00:29.590 align:start position:0%
you think to send the whole
record

05:00:29.590 --> 05:00:29.600 align:start position:0%
record
 
05:00:31.510 --> 05:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
from our standpoint it just depends on
 
05:00:33.510 --> 05:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
the law it depends on the fbi it depends
 
05:00:36.150 --> 05:00:36.160 align:start position:0%
on the law um that that's
 
05:00:38.070 --> 05:00:38.080 align:start position:0%
we're happy to do either i suppose it's
 
05:00:40.070 --> 05:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
just from our standpoint
 
05:00:43.110 --> 05:00:43.120 align:start position:0%
how the record gets disseminated um is
 
05:00:44.550 --> 05:00:44.560 align:start position:0%
of concern you know what i mean because
 
05:00:47.110 --> 05:00:47.120 align:start position:0%
we we are at the mercy of the fbi to say
 
05:00:49.510 --> 05:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
yes that's okay or no that isn't okay or
 
05:00:51.830 --> 05:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
it can only be disseminated once versus
 
05:00:53.750 --> 05:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
i disseminate it to you you disseminate
 
05:00:55.110 --> 05:00:55.120 align:start position:0%
it further disseminated that further
 
05:00:57.430 --> 05:00:57.440 align:start position:0%
dissemination is kind of where the issue
 
05:00:57.440 --> 05:00:58.230 align:start position:0%
dissemination is kind of where the issue
lies

05:00:58.230 --> 05:00:58.240 align:start position:0%
lies
 
05:01:00.070 --> 05:01:00.080 align:start position:0%
or the concern not it's not an issue of
 
05:01:02.628 --> 05:01:02.638 align:start position:0%
mine or ours it's just a function of can
 
05:01:03.670 --> 05:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
we do it
 
05:01:06.708 --> 05:01:06.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:10.390 --> 05:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
further questions represent like us
 
05:01:13.670 --> 05:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
yeah i do have i can't see you yes
 
05:01:15.510 --> 05:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
i do have a question based on a
 
05:01:17.350 --> 05:01:17.360 align:start position:0%
conversation we had earlier on an
 
05:01:18.868 --> 05:01:18.878 align:start position:0%
earlier bill
 
05:01:20.708 --> 05:01:20.718 align:start position:0%
and i i know
 
05:01:23.030 --> 05:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
you've talked to us numerous times and i
 
05:01:26.470 --> 05:01:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:28.868 --> 05:01:28.878 align:start position:0%
currently we have this
 
05:01:31.830 --> 05:01:31.840 align:start position:0%
education freedom accounts and a
 
05:01:34.070 --> 05:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization is the one who
 
05:01:38.150 --> 05:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
runs it and vets the vendors and etc
 
05:01:38.160 --> 05:01:39.590 align:start position:0%
runs it and vets the vendors and etc
but

05:01:39.590 --> 05:01:39.600 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:01:43.110 --> 05:01:43.120 align:start position:0%
only government agencies can
 
05:01:45.510 --> 05:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
request and get this information so the
 
05:01:46.948 --> 05:01:46.958 align:start position:0%
question is
 
05:01:50.948 --> 05:01:50.958 align:start position:0%
where we're using them to run our
 
05:01:52.948 --> 05:01:52.958 align:start position:0%
government program
 
05:01:57.270 --> 05:01:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:59.430 --> 05:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
who are you using i guess
 
05:02:02.070 --> 05:02:02.080 align:start position:0%
it's a scholarship organization
 
05:02:04.470 --> 05:02:04.480 align:start position:0%
that is it that runs the program and
 
05:02:05.590 --> 05:02:05.600 align:start position:0%
they're getting a record from the
 
05:02:07.750 --> 05:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
department of safety the question can
 
05:02:09.430 --> 05:02:09.440 align:start position:0%
they get a record from the department of
 
05:02:12.470 --> 05:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
safety because we're asking them to vet
 
05:02:14.230 --> 05:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
all of the people that work with the
 
05:02:14.240 --> 05:02:15.350 align:start position:0%
all of the people that work with the
kids

05:02:15.350 --> 05:02:15.360 align:start position:0%
kids
 
05:02:16.788 --> 05:02:16.798 align:start position:0%
can they do that
 
05:02:18.550 --> 05:02:18.560 align:start position:0%
i don't have an answer to that i would
 
05:02:20.708 --> 05:02:20.718 align:start position:0%
say the fbi i think restricts it to
 
05:02:23.110 --> 05:02:23.120 align:start position:0%
governmental agencies so
 
05:02:25.030 --> 05:02:25.040 align:start position:0%
i i don't know i have to
 
05:02:26.868 --> 05:02:26.878 align:start position:0%
look further thank you answer your
 
05:02:26.878 --> 05:02:27.830 align:start position:0%
look further thank you answer your
question

05:02:27.830 --> 05:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:02:29.750 --> 05:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
are there further
 
05:02:32.390 --> 05:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
05:02:33.990 --> 05:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
not seen thank you very much can you
 
05:02:36.070 --> 05:02:36.080 align:start position:0%
hang loose though until we're finished
 
05:02:37.750 --> 05:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
there it could be possibly if something
 
05:02:40.230 --> 05:02:40.240 align:start position:0%
else yes i'd like to have uh attorney
 
05:02:41.670 --> 05:02:41.680 align:start position:0%

and
 
05:02:47.910 --> 05:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
we've talked about this topic quite a
 
05:02:49.670 --> 05:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
bit here and
 
05:02:53.110 --> 05:02:53.120 align:start position:0%
um but now we have you know this issue
 
05:02:56.948 --> 05:02:56.958 align:start position:0%

05:03:24.948 --> 05:03:24.958 align:start position:0%
it is
 
05:03:28.230 --> 05:03:28.240 align:start position:0%
she and i had the opportunity to speak
 
05:03:30.150 --> 05:03:30.160 align:start position:0%
it is
 
05:03:32.470 --> 05:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
the overarching concern i suppose is
 
05:03:32.480 --> 05:03:33.270 align:start position:0%
the overarching concern i suppose is
that

05:03:33.270 --> 05:03:33.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:03:36.150 --> 05:03:36.160 align:start position:0%
we want to be mindful of creating and i
 
05:03:37.670 --> 05:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned this earlier today the
 
05:03:40.070 --> 05:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
infrastructure by which the department
 
05:03:42.070 --> 05:03:42.080 align:start position:0%
takes on this role the department is
 
05:03:44.070 --> 05:03:44.080 align:start position:0%
fully capable and able to take on this
 
05:03:47.270 --> 05:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
role and and we have done so with the
 
05:03:49.190 --> 05:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
implementation of bus drivers and
 
05:03:51.270 --> 05:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
first-time teacher educators
 
05:03:53.990 --> 05:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
however i will just reiterate
 
05:03:54.000 --> 05:03:55.510 align:start position:0%
however i will just reiterate
that

05:03:55.510 --> 05:03:55.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:03:55.520 --> 05:03:56.550 align:start position:0%
that
uh

05:03:56.550 --> 05:03:56.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:03:58.868 --> 05:03:58.878 align:start position:0%
i think we just have to be mindful
 
05:04:01.350 --> 05:04:01.360 align:start position:0%
of allowing the department the time to
 
05:04:03.590 --> 05:04:03.600 align:start position:0%
get this up and moving and work out all
 
05:04:06.788 --> 05:04:06.798 align:start position:0%
the kinks my hesitation is simply this
 
05:04:10.230 --> 05:04:10.240 align:start position:0%
if we move too far too fast
 
05:04:12.390 --> 05:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
children are harmed
 
05:04:12.400 --> 05:04:13.430 align:start position:0%
children are harmed
period

05:04:13.430 --> 05:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
period
 
05:04:14.948 --> 05:04:14.958 align:start position:0%
and no one in this room is okay with
 
05:04:14.958 --> 05:04:15.750 align:start position:0%
and no one in this room is okay with
that

05:04:15.750 --> 05:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:04:17.350 --> 05:04:17.360 align:start position:0%
is it something the department can take
 
05:04:19.590 --> 05:04:19.600 align:start position:0%
on absolutely it is a role that we are
 
05:04:22.150 --> 05:04:22.160 align:start position:0%
willing and able to take in fact i will
 
05:04:23.510 --> 05:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
share with you that when commissioner
 
05:04:25.350 --> 05:04:25.360 align:start position:0%
edelblut first started and i shared with
 
05:04:27.830 --> 05:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
him my vision for the department running
 
05:04:30.708 --> 05:04:30.718 align:start position:0%
teacher applicant records
 
05:04:33.030 --> 05:04:33.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner said to me well yeah let's
 
05:04:34.708 --> 05:04:34.718 align:start position:0%
do that let's get it done tomorrow and i
 
05:04:35.910 --> 05:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
said well let's
 
05:04:38.628 --> 05:04:38.638 align:start position:0%
just slow it down a little bit um
 
05:04:41.830 --> 05:04:41.840 align:start position:0%
and so we have worked quite extensively
 
05:04:44.788 --> 05:04:44.798 align:start position:0%
to create this program legislatively we
 
05:04:46.550 --> 05:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
have worked tirelessly with the
 
05:04:48.550 --> 05:04:48.560 align:start position:0%
department of safety because as you've
 
05:04:51.510 --> 05:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
heard from that testimony those federal
 
05:04:53.830 --> 05:04:53.840 align:start position:0%
regulations are are
 
05:04:56.948 --> 05:04:56.958 align:start position:0%
complicated to put it mildly
 
05:04:59.350 --> 05:04:59.360 align:start position:0%
so it was in discussing this with
 
05:05:01.990 --> 05:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire i said to her is
 
05:05:04.230 --> 05:05:04.240 align:start position:0%
this something the department can do yes
 
05:05:05.990 --> 05:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely it is a function they could
 
05:05:06.000 --> 05:05:07.670 align:start position:0%
absolutely it is a function they could
serve

05:05:07.670 --> 05:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
serve
 
05:05:07.680 --> 05:05:08.788 align:start position:0%
serve
but

05:05:08.788 --> 05:05:08.798 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:05:10.868 --> 05:05:10.878 align:start position:0%
when we start looking at this issue it
 
05:05:13.030 --> 05:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
is a pandora's box it is a slippery
 
05:05:14.948 --> 05:05:14.958 align:start position:0%
slope and you're going to quickly
 
05:05:16.550 --> 05:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
recognize and i think representative
 
05:05:18.788 --> 05:05:18.798 align:start position:0%
tanner you had the opportunity to to dip
 
05:05:20.708 --> 05:05:20.718 align:start position:0%
your toe in this pool a little bit and
 
05:05:22.550 --> 05:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
you were wise smarter than me and you
 
05:05:24.868 --> 05:05:24.878 align:start position:0%
pulled it right back out um
 
05:05:28.868 --> 05:05:28.878 align:start position:0%
it becomes a pandora's box because one
 
05:05:31.270 --> 05:05:31.280 align:start position:0%
group says well i go from school to
 
05:05:33.190 --> 05:05:33.200 align:start position:0%
school to school and another group says
 
05:05:34.628 --> 05:05:34.638 align:start position:0%
yeah i do too
 
05:05:37.430 --> 05:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
and so all of a sudden we have a bit of
 
05:05:39.270 --> 05:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
a quagmire on our hands and i think we
 
05:05:40.948 --> 05:05:40.958 align:start position:0%
have to be very mindful
 
05:05:42.868 --> 05:05:42.878 align:start position:0%
of the role the department plays and
 
05:05:48.230 --> 05:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:50.150 --> 05:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
i think it would behoove us
 
05:05:52.070 --> 05:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
to have a study committee
 
05:05:53.510 --> 05:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
i know sometimes it feels like we're
 
05:05:55.030 --> 05:05:55.040 align:start position:0%
kicking the can down the road but i
 
05:05:57.190 --> 05:05:57.200 align:start position:0%
think in this particular instance
 
05:05:59.590 --> 05:05:59.600 align:start position:0%
it would best be served to have those
 
05:06:01.590 --> 05:06:01.600 align:start position:0%
thoughtful conversations not only with
 
05:06:03.510 --> 05:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
the department of education but with our
 
05:06:05.670 --> 05:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
partners at the department of safety to
 
05:06:07.830 --> 05:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
really look at what this looks like and
 
05:06:09.430 --> 05:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
how it will play out
 
05:06:10.788 --> 05:06:10.798 align:start position:0%
because a couple of things that the
 
05:06:12.470 --> 05:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
lieutenant mentioned
 
05:06:15.270 --> 05:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
is that having stale records
 
05:06:19.270 --> 05:06:19.280 align:start position:0%
and we also have to recognize that
 
05:06:21.830 --> 05:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
when we look at the statute 189 13a
 
05:06:23.510 --> 05:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
which is always our guiding principle in
 
05:06:25.270 --> 05:06:25.280 align:start position:0%
this particular area
 
05:06:27.030 --> 05:06:27.040 align:start position:0%
those set out a limited number of
 
05:06:29.190 --> 05:06:29.200 align:start position:0%
offenses which prohibit
 
05:06:31.270 --> 05:06:31.280 align:start position:0%
employment absolutely prohibit it and
 
05:06:33.830 --> 05:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
that is clear across the state but each
 
05:06:36.948 --> 05:06:36.958 align:start position:0%
district is given discretion to say i
 
05:06:39.350 --> 05:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
can decide for my district for the
 
05:06:42.470 --> 05:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
particular um position in front of me if
 
05:06:44.150 --> 05:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
that record is going to work so they
 
05:06:46.310 --> 05:06:46.320 align:start position:0%
have a lot of discretion so we have to
 
05:06:48.310 --> 05:06:48.320 align:start position:0%
think very carefully about the role the
 
05:06:50.150 --> 05:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
department would play and whether we
 
05:06:51.990 --> 05:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
want to take that discretionary ability
 
05:06:53.670 --> 05:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
away from the districts and it's a it's
 
05:06:55.350 --> 05:06:55.360 align:start position:0%
a balancing test
 
05:06:55.360 --> 05:06:56.150 align:start position:0%
a balancing test
so

05:06:56.150 --> 05:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:06:58.550 --> 05:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
i think it is a very complex topic when
 
05:07:00.230 --> 05:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
you when you start peeling back the
 
05:07:02.470 --> 05:07:02.480 align:start position:0%
layers and i know representative tanner
 
05:07:04.550 --> 05:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
would agree with me although i i rarely
 
05:07:07.110 --> 05:07:07.120 align:start position:0%
speak on behalf of people um
 
05:07:09.270 --> 05:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
and so for those reasons
 
05:07:13.510 --> 05:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
uh i i would suggest that we uh that
 
05:07:15.270 --> 05:07:15.280 align:start position:0%
this committee established a study
 
05:07:16.628 --> 05:07:16.638 align:start position:0%
committee i think representative
 
05:07:16.638 --> 05:07:17.830 align:start position:0%
committee i think representative
mcguire's

05:07:17.830 --> 05:07:17.840 align:start position:0%
mcguire's
 
05:07:19.750 --> 05:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
approach is appropriate
 
05:07:22.708 --> 05:07:22.718 align:start position:0%
given the complexities
 
05:07:24.628 --> 05:07:24.638 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i i agree with you
 
05:07:27.190 --> 05:07:27.200 align:start position:0%
on that as a past administrator i know
 
05:07:28.708 --> 05:07:28.718 align:start position:0%
that the district over here the
 
05:07:31.030 --> 05:07:31.040 align:start position:0%
superintendent will receive something
 
05:07:33.990 --> 05:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
i would receive something and both were
 
05:07:36.310 --> 05:07:36.320 align:start position:0%
dealt with differently
 
05:07:39.110 --> 05:07:39.120 align:start position:0%
and so we have those lower levels of
 
05:07:41.350 --> 05:07:41.360 align:start position:0%
those agencies
 
05:07:43.190 --> 05:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
you know reacting differently towards
 
05:07:45.510 --> 05:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
certain situations so
 
05:07:49.830 --> 05:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
this is a difficult topic to uh bridge
 
05:07:52.948 --> 05:07:52.958 align:start position:0%
um it's a great topic to talk about yeah
 
05:07:55.190 --> 05:07:55.200 align:start position:0%
but let's the bridge yeah well let's
 
05:07:56.708 --> 05:07:56.718 align:start position:0%
take the opportunity to look at the
 
05:07:58.708 --> 05:07:58.718 align:start position:0%
infrastructure we create with first-time
 
05:08:00.868 --> 05:08:00.878 align:start position:0%
educator applicants those rules are just
 
05:08:03.110 --> 05:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
going into place uh next week at our
 
05:08:05.190 --> 05:08:05.200 align:start position:0%
next board meeting and so we need to
 
05:08:05.200 --> 05:08:06.070 align:start position:0%
next board meeting and so we need to
start

05:08:06.070 --> 05:08:06.080 align:start position:0%
start
 
05:08:08.470 --> 05:08:08.480 align:start position:0%
issuing those and and running those
 
05:08:10.150 --> 05:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
records and reviewing those records as a
 
05:08:11.990 --> 05:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
department and
 
05:08:12.000 --> 05:08:13.190 align:start position:0%
department and
see

05:08:13.190 --> 05:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
see
 
05:08:14.708 --> 05:08:14.718 align:start position:0%
it's inevitable anytime you take on a
 
05:08:16.868 --> 05:08:16.878 align:start position:0%
new task that there will be bumps in the
 
05:08:19.190 --> 05:08:19.200 align:start position:0%
road and we are aware of that and we're
 
05:08:21.270 --> 05:08:21.280 align:start position:0%
willing to work through those but i
 
05:08:23.110 --> 05:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
would like to work through those in a
 
05:08:23.120 --> 05:08:24.150 align:start position:0%
would like to work through those in a
smaller

05:08:24.150 --> 05:08:24.160 align:start position:0%
smaller
 
05:08:24.160 --> 05:08:25.430 align:start position:0%
smaller
chunk

05:08:25.430 --> 05:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
chunk
 
05:08:27.990 --> 05:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
and work out those issues than in a
 
05:08:30.550 --> 05:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
bigger heavier lift again
 
05:08:32.390 --> 05:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
because at the end of the day
 
05:08:34.150 --> 05:08:34.160 align:start position:0%
if there is a misstep
 
05:08:36.070 --> 05:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
it's child safety
 
05:08:37.590 --> 05:08:37.600 align:start position:0%
and i told the commissioner when he
 
05:08:40.550 --> 05:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
started in 2016 i'm not okay with that
 
05:08:41.830 --> 05:08:41.840 align:start position:0%
and i stand before you with the same
 
05:08:44.310 --> 05:08:44.320 align:start position:0%
testimony today
 
05:08:45.910 --> 05:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
further questions yes representative
 
05:08:47.750 --> 05:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
cornell thank you thank you for taking
 
05:08:50.230 --> 05:08:50.240 align:start position:0%
my question you mentioned stale
 
05:08:51.990 --> 05:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
records and i think this goes back to
 
05:08:54.150 --> 05:08:54.160 align:start position:0%
representative nelson's question once
 
05:08:55.830 --> 05:08:55.840 align:start position:0%
somebody goes through the check and
 
05:08:57.510 --> 05:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
they're okay
 
05:08:59.990 --> 05:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
do they get checked on a regular basis
 
05:09:02.070 --> 05:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
or is is that it unless something's like
 
05:09:04.310 --> 05:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
in the newspaper right thank you for the
 
05:09:06.150 --> 05:09:06.160 align:start position:0%
question and the minute i said the words
 
05:09:08.230 --> 05:09:08.240 align:start position:0%
i remember i recognized that i was
 
05:09:10.948 --> 05:09:10.958 align:start position:0%
speaking in code and and people probably
 
05:09:12.470 --> 05:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
thought i was talking about bread so i
 
05:09:15.110 --> 05:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
apologize for that so um in the criminal
 
05:09:17.510 --> 05:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
justice system if the minute a record is
 
05:09:20.230 --> 05:09:20.240 align:start position:0%
a day old it's referred to as stale
 
05:09:21.990 --> 05:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
because it's kind of like buying a new
 
05:09:23.910 --> 05:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
car the minute you drive it off the lot
 
05:09:25.910 --> 05:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
the price goes down the minute a record
 
05:09:29.350 --> 05:09:29.360 align:start position:0%
is a day old we don't know anymore so um
 
05:09:31.910 --> 05:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
currently in terms of employment
 
05:09:34.390 --> 05:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
if i work at a district and i was
 
05:09:34.400 --> 05:09:35.670 align:start position:0%
if i work at a district and i was
fingerprinted

05:09:35.670 --> 05:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
fingerprinted
 
05:09:38.788 --> 05:09:38.798 align:start position:0%
when i started back in pick a year
 
05:09:41.110 --> 05:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
i do not have to redo that background
 
05:09:43.430 --> 05:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
check if i stay at that district
 
05:09:45.270 --> 05:09:45.280 align:start position:0%
i will only have to redo that background
 
05:09:47.910 --> 05:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
check if i go to another district again
 
05:09:50.470 --> 05:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
it's an issue of employment
 
05:09:51.990 --> 05:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
and that's when those
 
05:09:53.510 --> 05:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
that comes up
 
05:09:55.590 --> 05:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
so yes we have educators in the state
 
05:09:57.350 --> 05:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
who have been employed at a district for
 
05:09:59.030 --> 05:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
20 30 years and they've been subject to
 
05:10:02.390 --> 05:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:03.910 --> 05:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
representative maguire you have your
 
05:10:07.350 --> 05:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
hand up here let's make her the the bill
 
05:10:10.628 --> 05:10:10.638 align:start position:0%
come on up and sit yes thank you i
 
05:10:12.788 --> 05:10:12.798 align:start position:0%
don't know about education but many of
 
05:10:15.670 --> 05:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
the professions have a requirement to
 
05:10:17.670 --> 05:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
renew one's license
 
05:10:20.390 --> 05:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
that you report on any
 
05:10:22.310 --> 05:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
criminal history that has happened since
 
05:10:24.470 --> 05:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
you last got your license
 
05:10:27.270 --> 05:10:27.280 align:start position:0%
so that if a speech-language pathologist
 
05:10:29.430 --> 05:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
is licensed for two years
 
05:10:31.270 --> 05:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
every two years they will report to the
 
05:10:33.110 --> 05:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
board that they have not committed any
 
05:10:35.110 --> 05:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
crime that would invalidate
 
05:10:37.270 --> 05:10:37.280 align:start position:0%
their qualifications for working in
 
05:10:37.280 --> 05:10:38.310 align:start position:0%
their qualifications for working in
schools

05:10:38.310 --> 05:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
schools
 
05:10:39.750 --> 05:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
05:10:39.760 --> 05:10:41.030 align:start position:0%
i don't know
about

05:10:41.030 --> 05:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:10:45.670 --> 05:10:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:48.310 --> 05:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
you don't have to put your hand up here
 
05:10:49.190 --> 05:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:10:51.910 --> 05:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
um so thank you representative mcguire
 
05:10:51.920 --> 05:10:54.390 align:start position:0%
um so thank you representative mcguire
um

05:10:54.390 --> 05:10:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:56.390 --> 05:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
under the code of conduct if a teacher
 
05:10:57.830 --> 05:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
is arrested for
 
05:10:59.990 --> 05:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
a section five violation they have an
 
05:11:02.310 --> 05:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
obligation to report that arrest
 
05:11:04.708 --> 05:11:04.718 align:start position:0%
um it is not for
 
05:11:06.628 --> 05:11:06.638 align:start position:0%
any and all arrests
 
05:11:09.190 --> 05:11:09.200 align:start position:0%
so for example a dwi which is not a
 
05:11:11.590 --> 05:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
section 5 violation would not have to be
 
05:11:15.110 --> 05:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
reported to the department um
 
05:11:17.190 --> 05:11:17.200 align:start position:0%
presumably the district would find out
 
05:11:19.670 --> 05:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
about it one way or another but that
 
05:11:21.910 --> 05:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
might be an issue of employment i would
 
05:11:23.510 --> 05:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
imagine that most districts have an
 
05:11:25.670 --> 05:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
employment policy that would require
 
05:11:26.948 --> 05:11:26.958 align:start position:0%
that someone
 
05:11:28.868 --> 05:11:28.878 align:start position:0%
report if they have been arrested but
 
05:11:30.708 --> 05:11:30.718 align:start position:0%
that is going to be a district to
 
05:11:35.110 --> 05:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:38.070 --> 05:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:39.750 --> 05:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
topic that representative mcguire
 
05:11:41.190 --> 05:11:41.200 align:start position:0%
brought up that i would be remiss if i
 
05:11:42.788 --> 05:11:42.798 align:start position:0%
didn't address
 
05:11:44.628 --> 05:11:44.638 align:start position:0%
is the idea that a lot of professions
 
05:11:46.150 --> 05:11:46.160 align:start position:0%
that are going into various school
 
05:11:48.070 --> 05:11:48.080 align:start position:0%
districts such as speech language
 
05:11:48.080 --> 05:11:50.150 align:start position:0%
districts such as speech language
pathologists

05:11:50.150 --> 05:11:50.160 align:start position:0%
pathologists
 
05:11:52.390 --> 05:11:52.400 align:start position:0%
nurses things like that we have to be
 
05:11:54.230 --> 05:11:54.240 align:start position:0%
cognizant that they have already gone
 
05:11:55.910 --> 05:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
through some type of background check
 
05:11:57.990 --> 05:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
for their license lawyers we go through
 
05:11:59.910 --> 05:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
a background check you know and so we
 
05:12:02.470 --> 05:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
can look at those entities very
 
05:12:03.830 --> 05:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
carefully to make sure that we're not
 
05:12:06.310 --> 05:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
being redundant in our practices and
 
05:12:08.150 --> 05:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
also to make sure that nothing's falling
 
05:12:09.430 --> 05:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
through the cracks
 
05:12:12.470 --> 05:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
so when we look at schools and i mention
 
05:12:13.910 --> 05:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
this to representative litchfield in the
 
05:12:15.910 --> 05:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
hallway schools were designed and
 
05:12:19.110 --> 05:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
envisioned to be open welcoming places
 
05:12:21.350 --> 05:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
they were and it's wonderful and now
 
05:12:22.868 --> 05:12:22.878 align:start position:0%
we're recognizing some of the pitfalls
 
05:12:24.550 --> 05:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
of that policy and so we're trying to
 
05:12:25.910 --> 05:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
tighten something that was designed to
 
05:12:27.910 --> 05:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
be open and welcoming and so we have to
 
05:12:29.750 --> 05:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
do it in a very thoughtful conscientious
 
05:12:29.760 --> 05:12:30.788 align:start position:0%
do it in a very thoughtful conscientious
manner

05:12:30.788 --> 05:12:30.798 align:start position:0%
manner
 
05:12:32.550 --> 05:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
as we recognize the number of people in
 
05:12:34.390 --> 05:12:34.400 align:start position:0%
the different types of people who go
 
05:12:37.910 --> 05:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
through the schools the school doors
 
05:12:39.750 --> 05:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions of the
 
05:12:39.760 --> 05:12:42.390 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions of the
department

05:12:42.390 --> 05:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
department
 
05:12:45.350 --> 05:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
last one from myself we've talked uh
 
05:12:47.350 --> 05:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
about several bills dealing with
 
05:12:49.510 --> 05:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
criminal background checks
 
05:12:52.070 --> 05:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
if we form a committee here would it be
 
05:12:54.230 --> 05:12:54.240 align:start position:0%
wise to fold some of those other issues
 
05:12:56.788 --> 05:12:56.798 align:start position:0%
into this study or should this remain
 
05:13:02.390 --> 05:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:04.868 --> 05:13:04.878 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day
 
05:13:07.510 --> 05:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
that is that is a decision for this
 
05:13:09.990 --> 05:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
committee to make however i will say
 
05:13:11.350 --> 05:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
this because that's a really that's a
 
05:13:13.750 --> 05:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
really dirty lawyer answer isn't it yeah
 
05:13:13.760 --> 05:13:15.750 align:start position:0%
really dirty lawyer answer isn't it yeah
yeah

05:13:15.750 --> 05:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:13:17.430 --> 05:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
is this being recorded i'm going to get
 
05:13:19.190 --> 05:13:19.200 align:start position:0%
our own lawyer on top
 
05:13:21.670 --> 05:13:21.680 align:start position:0%
i know i know i'm i'm hoping you don't
 
05:13:26.470 --> 05:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:28.550 --> 05:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
yes it is a great idea to look at all
 
05:13:31.270 --> 05:13:31.280 align:start position:0%
these issues my hesitation is my answer
 
05:13:32.550 --> 05:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
is simply this
 
05:13:34.868 --> 05:13:34.878 align:start position:0%
i had a wonderful opportunity to work
 
05:13:36.788 --> 05:13:36.798 align:start position:0%
with representative tanner on a similar
 
05:13:39.030 --> 05:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
study committee and what we found was it
 
05:13:40.708 --> 05:13:40.718 align:start position:0%
was overly broad
 
05:13:41.990 --> 05:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
and again i don't want to speak on
 
05:13:44.390 --> 05:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
behalf of representative tanner but my
 
05:13:47.350 --> 05:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
experience my takeaway from that was i
 
05:13:48.788 --> 05:13:48.798 align:start position:0%
think we would have
 
05:13:51.190 --> 05:13:51.200 align:start position:0%
been better served if we had narrowly
 
05:13:53.990 --> 05:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
tailored it to one or two issues the
 
05:13:56.070 --> 05:13:56.080 align:start position:0%
minute we started talking about this it
 
05:13:59.510 --> 05:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
was so big and it was so broad that
 
05:14:01.430 --> 05:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
we really kind of stumbled on over our
 
05:14:04.470 --> 05:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
own feet if that's fair to say um
 
05:14:05.750 --> 05:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
and so
 
05:14:07.750 --> 05:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
yes i think there is an opportunity to
 
05:14:09.990 --> 05:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
talk about this in a broader picture my
 
05:14:12.948 --> 05:14:12.958 align:start position:0%
only caveat and word of warning is
 
05:14:15.190 --> 05:14:15.200 align:start position:0%
once you get started down this path
 
05:14:17.030 --> 05:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
you're going to find that the ops the
 
05:14:19.590 --> 05:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
octopus has a lot of arms
 
05:14:19.600 --> 05:14:21.590 align:start position:0%
octopus has a lot of arms
so

05:14:21.590 --> 05:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:14:24.390 --> 05:14:24.400 align:start position:0%
do with that what you will
 
05:14:25.510 --> 05:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
and no one
 
05:14:27.510 --> 05:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
now no one wants to chair that committee
 
05:14:30.390 --> 05:14:30.400 align:start position:0%
i can tell everyone is going not me not
 
05:14:32.788 --> 05:14:32.798 align:start position:0%
me um so yes i think it's a great
 
05:14:34.628 --> 05:14:34.638 align:start position:0%
opportunity but it would only be
 
05:14:36.230 --> 05:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
successful if the department of
 
05:14:37.590 --> 05:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
education is there and the department of
 
05:14:37.600 --> 05:14:39.190 align:start position:0%
education is there and the department of
safety

05:14:39.190 --> 05:14:39.200 align:start position:0%
safety
 
05:14:40.550 --> 05:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
well we've already had representative
 
05:14:42.708 --> 05:14:42.718 align:start position:0%
mcguire say she will chair it
 
05:14:42.718 --> 05:14:46.070 align:start position:0%
mcguire say she will chair it
perfect

05:14:46.070 --> 05:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:54.070 --> 05:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:55.590 --> 05:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
yeah i agree
 
05:14:57.990 --> 05:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
okay are there any other questions for
 
05:14:58.000 --> 05:14:58.788 align:start position:0%
okay are there any other questions for
uh

05:14:58.788 --> 05:14:58.798 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:15:00.708 --> 05:15:00.718 align:start position:0%
the department not seniors thank you
 
05:15:02.470 --> 05:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
very much thank you for the opportunity
 
05:15:04.550 --> 05:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
do we have any other cards or is that
 
05:15:07.350 --> 05:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
no yes that's it
 
05:15:11.110 --> 05:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:13.190 --> 05:15:13.200 align:start position:0%
can you get a card done if you haven't
 
05:15:24.550 --> 05:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:25.990 --> 05:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is russian
 
05:15:28.550 --> 05:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
chester i live in bedford new hampshire
 
05:15:30.948 --> 05:15:30.958 align:start position:0%
i'm not speaking to this bill uh either
 
05:15:33.590 --> 05:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
opposed or support i'm just bringing up
 
05:15:35.350 --> 05:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
a little bit of education and
 
05:15:37.430 --> 05:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
understanding as to
 
05:15:39.510 --> 05:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
what something like this
 
05:15:42.550 --> 05:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
um i think so initially i came in
 
05:15:44.230 --> 05:15:44.240 align:start position:0%
thinking that i was opposed to this
 
05:15:46.310 --> 05:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
because that means spending money
 
05:15:50.150 --> 05:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
um but after hearing the um
 
05:15:53.190 --> 05:15:53.200 align:start position:0%
the representative who uh sponsored this
 
05:15:55.350 --> 05:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
bill the prime sponsor for this bill i
 
05:15:58.708 --> 05:15:58.718 align:start position:0%
think that it is really important to to
 
05:15:59.830 --> 05:15:59.840 align:start position:0%
think about
 
05:16:01.830 --> 05:16:01.840 align:start position:0%
looking into this and diving into this a
 
05:16:03.510 --> 05:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
little bit closer
 
05:16:05.990 --> 05:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
would you believe that
 
05:16:07.270 --> 05:16:07.280 align:start position:0%
more than
 
05:16:09.190 --> 05:16:09.200 align:start position:0%

all i was a classroom teacher once
 
05:18:08.150 --> 05:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this bell
 
05:18:08.160 --> 05:18:09.590 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this bell
is

05:18:09.590 --> 05:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:18:11.350 --> 05:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of
 
05:18:11.360 --> 05:18:12.470 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of
um

05:18:12.470 --> 05:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:18:14.470 --> 05:18:14.480 align:start position:0%
pieces of this and i'll try and be brief
 
05:18:16.550 --> 05:18:16.560 align:start position:0%
and i only plan to talk for about five
 
05:18:18.788 --> 05:18:18.798 align:start position:0%
minutes if that so please hold me to it
 
05:18:21.030 --> 05:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
because i can get off on a tangent i'm
 
05:18:22.550 --> 05:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
sure you folks don't want to hear any of
 
05:18:25.190 --> 05:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:26.628 --> 05:18:26.638 align:start position:0%
what this build does
 
05:18:26.638 --> 05:18:29.190 align:start position:0%
what this build does
is

05:18:29.190 --> 05:18:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:33.030 --> 05:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
all of our agencies have the ability to
 
05:18:35.350 --> 05:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
create administrative rules
 
05:18:37.590 --> 05:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
and these administrative rules
 
05:18:40.230 --> 05:18:40.240 align:start position:0%
have the effect of law basically they
 
05:18:40.240 --> 05:18:42.550 align:start position:0%
have the effect of law basically they
are

05:18:42.550 --> 05:18:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:44.310 --> 05:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
when perusing through the
 
05:18:49.030 --> 05:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:49.040 --> 05:18:50.070 align:start position:0%
 
in

05:18:50.070 --> 05:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:18:52.788 --> 05:18:52.798 align:start position:0%
i mean uh administrative rules
 
05:18:54.150 --> 05:18:54.160 align:start position:0%
it's in uh
 
05:18:56.788 --> 05:18:56.798 align:start position:0%
pretty much chapter uh 300 it goes
 
05:18:59.670 --> 05:18:59.680 align:start position:0%
chapter 200 but but 300
 
05:18:59.680 --> 05:19:00.788 align:start position:0%
chapter 200 but but 300
has

05:19:00.788 --> 05:19:00.798 align:start position:0%
has
 
05:19:02.150 --> 05:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
many different
 
05:19:04.390 --> 05:19:04.400 align:start position:0%
pieces of it 302 is duties of school
 
05:19:04.400 --> 05:19:05.750 align:start position:0%
pieces of it 302 is duties of school
superintendents

05:19:05.750 --> 05:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
superintendents
 
05:19:08.550 --> 05:19:08.560 align:start position:0%
300 by the way is titled the ministry
 
05:19:11.190 --> 05:19:11.200 align:start position:0%
administration of minimum standards
 
05:19:13.270 --> 05:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
for public schools and then it goes on
 
05:19:15.270 --> 05:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
it outlines things of like school boards
 
05:19:17.990 --> 05:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
principles duties um things
 
05:19:19.910 --> 05:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
construction of schools
 
05:19:21.430 --> 05:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
uh development of appropriate
 
05:19:23.510 --> 05:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate daily activities but there
 
05:19:25.430 --> 05:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
was one section in here
 
05:19:28.628 --> 05:19:28.638 align:start position:0%
and it's in 306 that said minimum
 
05:19:32.470 --> 05:19:32.480 align:start position:0%
standards for uh public school approval
 
05:19:34.390 --> 05:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
and when i got into that
 
05:19:34.400 --> 05:19:36.470 align:start position:0%
and when i got into that
um

05:19:36.470 --> 05:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:40.830 --> 05:19:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:47.670 --> 05:19:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:50.230 --> 05:19:50.240 align:start position:0%
what grabbed my attention is is the
 
05:19:53.510 --> 05:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:55.750 --> 05:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
typically as a as an educator i learned
 
05:19:56.868 --> 05:19:56.878 align:start position:0%
pretty quick
 
05:19:58.550 --> 05:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
that um
 
05:20:01.030 --> 05:20:01.040 align:start position:0%
there's a language that's spoken amongst
 
05:20:03.190 --> 05:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
those who are in the education field
 
05:20:05.750 --> 05:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
um i used to call it eduese i don't know
 
05:20:07.830 --> 05:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
if it's still called that anymore it's
 
05:20:10.150 --> 05:20:10.160 align:start position:0%
basically a way to put word salad a word
 
05:20:12.390 --> 05:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
salad together with a lot of very very
 
05:20:14.788 --> 05:20:14.798 align:start position:0%
good words that basically don't amount
 
05:20:16.310 --> 05:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
to much
 
05:20:18.230 --> 05:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
and that's what this climate culture
 
05:20:20.948 --> 05:20:20.958 align:start position:0%
thing is in this particular section of
 
05:20:22.788 --> 05:20:22.798 align:start position:0%
the administrative rules there's two
 
05:20:25.990 --> 05:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
parts one part deals with um what the
 
05:20:27.270 --> 05:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
school board
 
05:20:28.948 --> 05:20:28.958 align:start position:0%
is required to do
 
05:20:31.990 --> 05:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
um or or shall reflect in their uh
 
05:20:34.548 --> 05:20:34.558 align:start position:0%
policies one is uh acknowledgement of
 
05:20:37.030 --> 05:20:37.040 align:start position:0%
diversity and respect for differences
 
05:20:38.470 --> 05:20:38.480 align:start position:0%
i'm going to start start
 
05:20:41.430 --> 05:20:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:43.830 --> 05:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
first off if you go to the beginning of
 
05:20:45.510 --> 05:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
all of these administrative rules they
 
05:20:47.510 --> 05:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
have definitions there are no
 
05:20:50.948 --> 05:20:50.958 align:start position:0%
definitions for diversity um at all in
 
05:20:52.548 --> 05:20:52.558 align:start position:0%
this or or
 
05:20:54.708 --> 05:20:54.718 align:start position:0%
or what differences are
 
05:20:56.788 --> 05:20:56.798 align:start position:0%
i know what the intent is and the intent
 
05:20:58.788 --> 05:20:58.798 align:start position:0%
here is to go on the same four things
 
05:21:01.030 --> 05:21:01.040 align:start position:0%
that are always the the diversity uh
 
05:21:04.310 --> 05:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
argument um generally uh race
 
05:21:04.320 --> 05:21:05.350 align:start position:0%
argument um generally uh race
uh

05:21:05.350 --> 05:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:21:11.350 --> 05:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:14.230 --> 05:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
but diversity is far far more than that
 
05:21:15.910 --> 05:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
diversity could be intelligence
 
05:21:18.470 --> 05:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
diversity can be
 
05:21:21.670 --> 05:21:21.680 align:start position:0%
shoe size diversity could be uh the
 
05:21:23.910 --> 05:21:23.920 align:start position:0%
proclivity to like a particular color or
 
05:21:27.110 --> 05:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
an athletic ability there's zillions
 
05:21:29.750 --> 05:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
literally countless ways to be diverse
 
05:21:31.190 --> 05:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
my point is
 
05:21:32.310 --> 05:21:32.320 align:start position:0%
is that
 
05:21:34.390 --> 05:21:34.400 align:start position:0%
this is hamstringing
 
05:21:36.150 --> 05:21:36.160 align:start position:0%
your educators
 
05:21:38.390 --> 05:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
because they have to follow this stuff
 
05:21:40.390 --> 05:21:40.400 align:start position:0%
okay there's a a few other things in
 
05:21:43.590 --> 05:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
here too that are are similar um i'll
 
05:21:46.150 --> 05:21:46.160 align:start position:0%
give you one of my favorite ones here uh
 
05:21:49.270 --> 05:21:49.280 align:start position:0%
uh where is it a respectful use of
 
05:21:51.350 --> 05:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
language and behavior by all school
 
05:21:53.750 --> 05:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
members that is void of ethnic racial
 
05:21:57.590 --> 05:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
and sexual stereotypes and biases
 
05:21:59.350 --> 05:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
sounds great
 
05:22:01.350 --> 05:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
our schools are failing miserably when
 
05:22:04.070 --> 05:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
it comes to education i think
 
05:22:06.470 --> 05:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
climate and culture is not something
 
05:22:08.628 --> 05:22:08.638 align:start position:0%
that actually needs to be in
 
05:22:11.270 --> 05:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
in this type of a uh
 
05:22:11.280 --> 05:22:12.788 align:start position:0%
in this type of a uh
rule

05:22:12.788 --> 05:22:12.798 align:start position:0%
rule
 
05:22:15.190 --> 05:22:15.200 align:start position:0%
these your schools are more than capable
 
05:22:17.750 --> 05:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
on that particular one respectful use of
 
05:22:19.750 --> 05:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
language i'm pretty sure
 
05:22:21.590 --> 05:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
all school teachers
 
05:22:23.750 --> 05:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
demand respectful use of language this
 
05:22:25.430 --> 05:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
is not something that needs to be in
 
05:22:25.440 --> 05:22:26.628 align:start position:0%
is not something that needs to be in
here

05:22:26.628 --> 05:22:26.638 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:22:28.788 --> 05:22:28.798 align:start position:0%
it's it's an overreach and the overage
 
05:22:32.788 --> 05:22:32.798 align:start position:0%
comes from a
 
05:22:36.230 --> 05:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
from a system where by
 
05:22:38.708 --> 05:22:38.718 align:start position:0%
us the legislative body has abdicated
 
05:22:38.718 --> 05:22:39.910 align:start position:0%
us the legislative body has abdicated
their

05:22:39.910 --> 05:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
their
 
05:22:43.750 --> 05:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
authority in creating rule of law
 
05:22:46.230 --> 05:22:46.240 align:start position:0%
we've done so by giving administrations
 
05:22:48.788 --> 05:22:48.798 align:start position:0%
the ability to create what they want
 
05:22:50.788 --> 05:22:50.798 align:start position:0%
most of the time they do a pretty good
 
05:22:54.230 --> 05:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
job sometimes they don't and all of the
 
05:22:55.990 --> 05:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
time they're not accountable to the
 
05:22:58.628 --> 05:22:58.638 align:start position:0%
people of the state
 
05:22:58.638 --> 05:22:59.910 align:start position:0%
people of the state
so

05:22:59.910 --> 05:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:23:02.230 --> 05:23:02.240 align:start position:0%
in this instance
 
05:23:04.868 --> 05:23:04.878 align:start position:0%
the only way that i could go after this
 
05:23:07.590 --> 05:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
is i can't or we can't do anything about
 
05:23:09.350 --> 05:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
what the administrative rules are that
 
05:23:09.360 --> 05:23:10.150 align:start position:0%
what the administrative rules are that
they

05:23:10.150 --> 05:23:10.160 align:start position:0%
they
 
05:23:13.110 --> 05:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
decide are going to be it either has to
 
05:23:15.270 --> 05:23:15.280 align:start position:0%
run out because they go i believe in
 
05:23:17.110 --> 05:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
blocks of eight years
 
05:23:19.270 --> 05:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
net currently um
 
05:23:21.910 --> 05:23:21.920 align:start position:0%
they either run out and are not re-upped
 
05:23:24.150 --> 05:23:24.160 align:start position:0%
or they're rewritten at that point or
 
05:23:26.788 --> 05:23:26.798 align:start position:0%
they just can or they can be continued
 
05:23:26.798 --> 05:23:27.830 align:start position:0%
they just can or they can be continued
um

05:23:27.830 --> 05:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:29.590 --> 05:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
unless we
 
05:23:30.868 --> 05:23:30.878 align:start position:0%
dial back
 
05:23:32.708 --> 05:23:32.718 align:start position:0%
what it is that they can do
 
05:23:34.230 --> 05:23:34.240 align:start position:0%
which is what my bill does that's why
 
05:23:35.910 --> 05:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
there's really no mention of
 
05:23:35.920 --> 05:23:36.628 align:start position:0%
there's really no mention of
of

05:23:36.628 --> 05:23:36.638 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:23:38.708 --> 05:23:38.718 align:start position:0%
the actual statute that's um in the
 
05:23:41.270 --> 05:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
education thing that's a 306.06 if you
 
05:23:42.708 --> 05:23:42.718 align:start position:0%
want to actually
 
05:23:46.310 --> 05:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:50.788 --> 05:23:50.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:52.830 --> 05:23:52.840 align:start position:0%
that's mentioned in my bill of
 
05:23:57.190 --> 05:23:57.200 align:start position:0%
um school board state board of education
 
05:23:58.948 --> 05:23:58.958 align:start position:0%
the powers that they have that's under
 
05:24:01.030 --> 05:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh title uh
 
05:24:05.830 --> 05:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
i believe it's 15 education chapter 186.
 
05:24:08.548 --> 05:24:08.558 align:start position:0%
this particular one is 186.5 and i just
 
05:24:10.390 --> 05:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
want to quickly just go over a
 
05:24:11.830 --> 05:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
particular little piece of it it's a
 
05:24:11.840 --> 05:24:13.270 align:start position:0%
particular little piece of it it's a
small

05:24:13.270 --> 05:24:13.280 align:start position:0%
small
 
05:24:14.868 --> 05:24:14.878 align:start position:0%
section and i won't bore you with the
 
05:24:17.590 --> 05:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
whole thing but it says
 
05:24:20.070 --> 05:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
it it may make all rules and regulations
 
05:24:21.830 --> 05:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
necessary for the management of its own
 
05:24:23.910 --> 05:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
business and conduct
 
05:24:25.590 --> 05:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
and for the conduct of its officers
 
05:24:27.830 --> 05:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
employees and agents to ensure the
 
05:24:29.910 --> 05:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
efficient administration of public
 
05:24:31.990 --> 05:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
schools and the administration
 
05:24:34.548 --> 05:24:34.558 align:start position:0%
of the work of americanization
 
05:24:36.390 --> 05:24:36.400 align:start position:0%
in teaching english to non-english
 
05:24:38.390 --> 05:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
speaking adults and in furnishing
 
05:24:40.470 --> 05:24:40.480 align:start position:0%
instruction in the privileges duties and
 
05:24:42.708 --> 05:24:42.718 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of citizenship which is
 
05:24:44.788 --> 05:24:44.798 align:start position:0%
hereby declared to be an essential part
 
05:24:44.798 --> 05:24:45.590 align:start position:0%
hereby declared to be an essential part
of

05:24:45.590 --> 05:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:24:49.030 --> 05:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
public school education
 
05:24:51.990 --> 05:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
climate and culture
 
05:24:54.390 --> 05:24:54.400 align:start position:0%
i ask anybody here to define that
 
05:24:56.548 --> 05:24:56.558 align:start position:0%
specifically and what that has to do
 
05:24:59.030 --> 05:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
with teaching children how to read write
 
05:25:01.670 --> 05:25:01.680 align:start position:0%
think properly any of this any of this
 
05:25:01.680 --> 05:25:02.548 align:start position:0%
think properly any of this any of this
stuff

05:25:02.548 --> 05:25:02.558 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
05:25:05.030 --> 05:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
um so that's basically it in a nutshell
 
05:25:06.868 --> 05:25:06.878 align:start position:0%
i'd be more than happy to entertain any
 
05:25:09.670 --> 05:25:09.680 align:start position:0%
questions any you may have of me uh and
 
05:25:12.070 --> 05:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
i'll do my best to answer them
 
05:25:14.230 --> 05:25:14.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh questions
 
05:25:16.390 --> 05:25:16.400 align:start position:0%
represent luna
 
05:25:18.310 --> 05:25:18.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair did you do
 
05:25:20.548 --> 05:25:20.558 align:start position:0%
any research before writing this bill
 
05:25:22.948 --> 05:25:22.958 align:start position:0%
a little bit yes uh follow up on that
 
05:25:26.230 --> 05:25:26.240 align:start position:0%
yes did you um did you research um the
 
05:25:28.470 --> 05:25:28.480 align:start position:0%
expiration of administrative rules yes
 
05:25:30.708 --> 05:25:30.718 align:start position:0%
they generally expire about every eight
 
05:25:33.190 --> 05:25:33.200 align:start position:0%
years i believe currently and um and
 
05:25:35.910 --> 05:25:35.920 align:start position:0%
then the final thing is
 
05:25:37.510 --> 05:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
where did you research and come to the
 
05:25:37.520 --> 05:25:38.868 align:start position:0%
where did you research and come to the
conclusion

05:25:38.868 --> 05:25:38.878 align:start position:0%
conclusion
 
05:25:40.788 --> 05:25:40.798 align:start position:0%
that quote fail schools are failing
 
05:25:43.830 --> 05:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
miserably when it comes to education um
 
05:25:46.548 --> 05:25:46.558 align:start position:0%
that one pretty much comes from my
 
05:25:49.430 --> 05:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
hometown where the um
 
05:25:49.440 --> 05:25:50.548 align:start position:0%
hometown where the um
actual

05:25:50.548 --> 05:25:50.558 align:start position:0%
actual
 
05:25:54.708 --> 05:25:54.718 align:start position:0%
uh proficiency rate is i believe 32
 
05:25:57.590 --> 05:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
so 32 proficiency rate of children that
 
05:25:59.270 --> 05:25:59.280 align:start position:0%
are actually on
 
05:26:02.310 --> 05:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
grade level with reading writing
 
05:26:06.310 --> 05:26:06.320 align:start position:0%
and mathematics which means 66 percent
 
05:26:07.990 --> 05:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
are failing
 
05:26:09.990 --> 05:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
so follow-up would it be fair to say
 
05:26:10.000 --> 05:26:10.788 align:start position:0%
so follow-up would it be fair to say
then

05:26:10.788 --> 05:26:10.798 align:start position:0%
then
 
05:26:13.190 --> 05:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
that when you're talking about schools
 
05:26:14.868 --> 05:26:14.878 align:start position:0%
are failing miserably when it comes to
 
05:26:16.868 --> 05:26:16.878 align:start position:0%
education you're talking about the
 
05:26:20.150 --> 05:26:20.160 align:start position:0%
schools in the town you are from and not
 
05:26:22.948 --> 05:26:22.958 align:start position:0%
a statewide phenomena no no i'm talking
 
05:26:27.510 --> 05:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:29.750 --> 05:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
yeah that's just
 
05:26:32.788 --> 05:26:32.798 align:start position:0%
when i to to clarify when i say failing
 
05:26:35.430 --> 05:26:35.440 align:start position:0%
miserably i'm saying that academically
 
05:26:37.430 --> 05:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
and achievement wise they're not where
 
05:26:38.788 --> 05:26:38.798 align:start position:0%
they should be
 
05:26:41.430 --> 05:26:41.440 align:start position:0%
and things of this nature which are
 
05:26:45.030 --> 05:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely useless are involved in
 
05:26:47.430 --> 05:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
hampering our educators from doing what
 
05:26:49.910 --> 05:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
it is that they are supposed to be doing
 
05:26:53.190 --> 05:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
i hope that answers your question
 
05:26:55.430 --> 05:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
representative mullen
 
05:26:57.110 --> 05:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
05:26:59.030 --> 05:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question um
 
05:27:01.830 --> 05:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
did you talk to anybody at the bureau of
 
05:27:03.670 --> 05:27:03.680 align:start position:0%
student wellness at the department of
 
05:27:06.868 --> 05:27:06.878 align:start position:0%
education i did not i did not um i think
 
05:27:08.628 --> 05:27:08.638 align:start position:0%
you might want to because they do
 
05:27:10.470 --> 05:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
they've done a significant amount of
 
05:27:12.788 --> 05:27:12.798 align:start position:0%
work around climate and culture through
 
05:27:14.948 --> 05:27:14.958 align:start position:0%
the department of education
 
05:27:17.110 --> 05:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
and i think that um
 
05:27:19.910 --> 05:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
they might be able to clear up some of
 
05:27:19.920 --> 05:27:21.670 align:start position:0%
they might be able to clear up some of
the

05:27:21.670 --> 05:27:21.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:27:23.830 --> 05:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
questions that you have about the
 
05:27:28.230 --> 05:27:28.240 align:start position:0%
usefulness and appropriateness of
 
05:27:31.510 --> 05:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
looking at the climate and culture of a
 
05:27:33.110 --> 05:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
school building
 
05:27:33.120 --> 05:27:35.350 align:start position:0%
school building
because

05:27:35.350 --> 05:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:27:37.910 --> 05:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
i i think there may be more than one way
 
05:27:40.070 --> 05:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
to define climate and culture and i
 
05:27:41.350 --> 05:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
think that
 
05:27:43.430 --> 05:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
you may only be looking at it from one
 
05:27:43.440 --> 05:27:44.150 align:start position:0%
you may only be looking at it from one
uh

05:27:44.150 --> 05:27:44.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:27:47.910 --> 05:27:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:49.430 --> 05:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
so the question
 
05:27:51.270 --> 05:27:51.280 align:start position:0%
my question is have you spoken to
 
05:27:53.190 --> 05:27:53.200 align:start position:0%
anybody at the bureau of student
 
05:27:56.708 --> 05:27:56.718 align:start position:0%
wellness i haven't and as far as um
 
05:27:58.788 --> 05:27:58.798 align:start position:0%
climate and culture goes
 
05:28:00.628 --> 05:28:00.638 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely right it can mean many
 
05:28:02.470 --> 05:28:02.480 align:start position:0%
many different things
 
05:28:04.230 --> 05:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
the part that i have a problem with is
 
05:28:07.590 --> 05:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
is the culture is american
 
05:28:09.110 --> 05:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
we're all american we all live in this
 
05:28:10.868 --> 05:28:10.878 align:start position:0%
country that's our culture there
 
05:28:12.948 --> 05:28:12.958 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be a subculture being taught
 
05:28:14.230 --> 05:28:14.240 align:start position:0%
in the schools
 
05:28:15.590 --> 05:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
and that's what i'm trying to address
 
05:28:15.600 --> 05:28:18.868 align:start position:0%
and that's what i'm trying to address
here

05:28:18.868 --> 05:28:18.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:21.830 --> 05:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:25.110 --> 05:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
could a climate of honesty and a culture
 
05:28:26.470 --> 05:28:26.480 align:start position:0%
of learning
 
05:28:28.788 --> 05:28:28.798 align:start position:0%
be a climate and culture that we might
 
05:28:31.110 --> 05:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
want to have in our schools
 
05:28:33.190 --> 05:28:33.200 align:start position:0%
absolutely um
 
05:28:36.390 --> 05:28:36.400 align:start position:0%
you have to understand how
 
05:28:38.390 --> 05:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
how this had how i had to have this
 
05:28:38.400 --> 05:28:40.390 align:start position:0%
how this had how i had to have this
written

05:28:40.390 --> 05:28:40.400 align:start position:0%
written
 
05:28:44.470 --> 05:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
i can't specifically pull out pieces of
 
05:28:47.750 --> 05:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
the administrative rule
 
05:28:50.310 --> 05:28:50.320 align:start position:0%
the only way that that can be done
 
05:28:52.150 --> 05:28:52.160 align:start position:0%
is by this broader
 
05:28:54.150 --> 05:28:54.160 align:start position:0%
stroke of the brush i would much rather
 
05:28:56.230 --> 05:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
just have some of the because to be
 
05:28:59.190 --> 05:28:59.200 align:start position:0%
honest with you there are in that small
 
05:29:00.628 --> 05:29:00.638 align:start position:0%
little piece of the of the
 
05:29:02.708 --> 05:29:02.718 align:start position:0%
administrative rule only about half of
 
05:29:05.270 --> 05:29:05.280 align:start position:0%
it do i actually have a a problem with
 
05:29:07.830 --> 05:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
the other half is is inconsequential or
 
05:29:07.840 --> 05:29:08.708 align:start position:0%
the other half is is inconsequential or
fine

05:29:08.708 --> 05:29:08.718 align:start position:0%
fine
 
05:29:08.718 --> 05:29:09.990 align:start position:0%
fine
um

05:29:09.990 --> 05:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:29:12.868 --> 05:29:12.878 align:start position:0%
but after going over and over and over
 
05:29:16.230 --> 05:29:16.240 align:start position:0%
my options to be able to take things out
 
05:29:16.240 --> 05:29:19.750 align:start position:0%
my options to be able to take things out
okay

05:29:19.750 --> 05:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:22.150 --> 05:29:22.160 align:start position:0%
the language was terrible
 
05:29:24.548 --> 05:29:24.558 align:start position:0%
in in other words um if i can just give
 
05:29:27.670 --> 05:29:27.680 align:start position:0%
you a quick example um let me just
 
05:29:30.470 --> 05:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
quickly find this here if i can
 
05:29:30.480 --> 05:29:31.910 align:start position:0%
quickly find this here if i can
okay

05:29:31.910 --> 05:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:29:34.150 --> 05:29:34.160 align:start position:0%
if i wanted to have
 
05:29:35.750 --> 05:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
the acknowledgement of diversity and
 
05:29:38.390 --> 05:29:38.400 align:start position:0%
respect for differences taken out and
 
05:29:40.948 --> 05:29:40.958 align:start position:0%
and and don't get me wrong that's fine i
 
05:29:42.470 --> 05:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
just don't think it should be a priority
 
05:29:45.270 --> 05:29:45.280 align:start position:0%
to be taught we're all different it's a
 
05:29:47.030 --> 05:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
given everybody in this room is
 
05:29:48.310 --> 05:29:48.320 align:start position:0%
different it's not something that needs
 
05:29:51.510 --> 05:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
to be dwelled on or or harped on
 
05:29:54.230 --> 05:29:54.240 align:start position:0%
the the point is is
 
05:29:56.548 --> 05:29:56.558 align:start position:0%
if it was to be written to take that out
 
05:29:59.350 --> 05:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
it would sound something to this nature
 
05:30:02.628 --> 05:30:02.638 align:start position:0%
it is not um applicable for a school to
 
05:30:04.628 --> 05:30:04.638 align:start position:0%
be able to adopt a policy that is
 
05:30:06.948 --> 05:30:06.958 align:start position:0%
favorable to diversity and
 
05:30:08.390 --> 05:30:08.400 align:start position:0%
you see what i mean yeah it was that's
 
05:30:10.390 --> 05:30:10.400 align:start position:0%
the face i made i'm like
 
05:30:11.750 --> 05:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
there's just no way that you can write
 
05:30:13.510 --> 05:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
something like that it just it sounded
 
05:30:15.510 --> 05:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely horrible and it it didn't
 
05:30:16.948 --> 05:30:16.958 align:start position:0%
really meet
 
05:30:18.310 --> 05:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
the purpose of what i was trying to
 
05:30:20.310 --> 05:30:20.320 align:start position:0%
accomplish here i hope that answers you
 
05:30:23.990 --> 05:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:26.708 --> 05:30:26.718 align:start position:0%
i have a question for you i'm looking at
 
05:30:28.390 --> 05:30:28.400 align:start position:0%
the minimum standards of public school
 
05:30:30.310 --> 05:30:30.320 align:start position:0%
approval right now
 
05:30:33.270 --> 05:30:33.280 align:start position:0%
underneath 306.06 culture and climate
 
05:30:35.190 --> 05:30:35.200 align:start position:0%
yes and one of the statements in there
 
05:30:36.548 --> 05:30:36.558 align:start position:0%
says the school administration shall
 
05:30:37.910 --> 05:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
provide professional development
 
05:30:37.920 --> 05:30:39.270 align:start position:0%
provide professional development
opportunities

05:30:39.270 --> 05:30:39.280 align:start position:0%
opportunities
 
05:30:41.350 --> 05:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
great directed at understanding the
 
05:30:43.750 --> 05:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
policies and reporting requirements that
 
05:30:45.670 --> 05:30:45.680 align:start position:0%
support a safe and healthy school
 
05:30:45.680 --> 05:30:46.788 align:start position:0%
support a safe and healthy school
environment

05:30:46.788 --> 05:30:46.798 align:start position:0%
environment
 
05:30:48.628 --> 05:30:48.638 align:start position:0%
that's under the section that you're
 
05:30:50.070 --> 05:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
05:30:52.310 --> 05:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
there's other sections uh
 
05:30:54.708 --> 05:30:54.718 align:start position:0%
review ways in which equity gaps and
 
05:30:57.430 --> 05:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
achievement which we're constantly on
 
05:30:59.670 --> 05:30:59.680 align:start position:0%
this committee dealing how we close
 
05:31:00.948 --> 05:31:00.958 align:start position:0%
those gaps
 
05:31:03.830 --> 05:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
that we have on our statewide assessment
 
05:31:05.990 --> 05:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
and can be reduced and barriers to
 
05:31:09.030 --> 05:31:09.040 align:start position:0%
learning can be eliminated
 
05:31:11.270 --> 05:31:11.280 align:start position:0%
as i read the statements whether it's an
 
05:31:13.510 --> 05:31:13.520 align:start position:0%
a b or c underneath what you're calling
 
05:31:15.750 --> 05:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
the culture and climate here and which
 
05:31:18.948 --> 05:31:18.958 align:start position:0%
is identified as culture and climate
 
05:31:20.708 --> 05:31:20.718 align:start position:0%
i guess i need some help here in
 
05:31:23.190 --> 05:31:23.200 align:start position:0%
understanding why these policies that
 
05:31:25.030 --> 05:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
shall be adopted by the local school
 
05:31:27.830 --> 05:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
board or school administration and staff
 
05:31:30.070 --> 05:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
or school administration
 
05:31:32.150 --> 05:31:32.160 align:start position:0%
are are contrary to what we should be
 
05:31:34.470 --> 05:31:34.480 align:start position:0%
doing in schools
 
05:31:36.470 --> 05:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
there's a lot there i'll try to i'll i
 
05:31:38.470 --> 05:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
may have to ask you to repeat but i'll
 
05:31:40.708 --> 05:31:40.718 align:start position:0%
i'll try to answer you in in in the
 
05:31:42.150 --> 05:31:42.160 align:start position:0%
order that you asked
 
05:31:44.788 --> 05:31:44.798 align:start position:0%
um the school administration shall uh
 
05:31:47.750 --> 05:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
provide uh development
 
05:31:49.510 --> 05:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
that was one of the ones that i had
 
05:31:51.590 --> 05:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier that was fine as far
 
05:31:53.670 --> 05:31:53.680 align:start position:0%
as i was concerned the thing also that
 
05:31:55.990 --> 05:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
you uh if you do peruse through all of
 
05:31:56.000 --> 05:31:56.788 align:start position:0%
you uh if you do peruse through all of
this

05:31:56.788 --> 05:31:56.798 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:31:59.430 --> 05:31:59.440 align:start position:0%
literally almost everything that is in
 
05:32:01.670 --> 05:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
this particular piece is covered
 
05:32:05.190 --> 05:32:05.200 align:start position:0%
somewhere else in all of the education
 
05:32:07.270 --> 05:32:07.280 align:start position:0%
uh they cover health they cover
 
05:32:09.190 --> 05:32:09.200 align:start position:0%
well-being they cover personal
 
05:32:10.788 --> 05:32:10.798 align:start position:0%
development they cover all of these
 
05:32:14.230 --> 05:32:14.240 align:start position:0%
things this is a redundancy basically
 
05:32:16.548 --> 05:32:16.558 align:start position:0%
as far as uh work together and a fair
 
05:32:19.750 --> 05:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
and equitable uh was it was it
 
05:32:19.760 --> 05:32:20.628 align:start position:0%
and equitable uh was it was it
uh

05:32:20.628 --> 05:32:20.638 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:32:22.628 --> 05:32:22.638 align:start position:0%
which one was a code of conduct code of
 
05:32:23.590 --> 05:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
discipline is that the one that you
 
05:32:25.910 --> 05:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned i i read one uh a review of
 
05:32:28.070 --> 05:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
equity gaps and achievement yeah
 
05:32:29.990 --> 05:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
administration and staff i'm going to
 
05:32:32.390 --> 05:32:32.400 align:start position:0%
say something that's not popular
 
05:32:34.868 --> 05:32:34.878 align:start position:0%
everybody's different
 
05:32:37.350 --> 05:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
if somebody is smarter they're smarter
 
05:32:40.390 --> 05:32:40.400 align:start position:0%
if somebody is not quite as smart that
 
05:32:42.868 --> 05:32:42.878 align:start position:0%
happens you can you obviously you're
 
05:32:45.110 --> 05:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
going to try and educate everybody as
 
05:32:46.628 --> 05:32:46.638 align:start position:0%
best as you can
 
05:32:48.948 --> 05:32:48.958 align:start position:0%
but equity is not
 
05:32:52.230 --> 05:32:52.240 align:start position:0%
the opportunity equity is the outcome if
 
05:32:53.750 --> 05:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
you're trying to make everybody have an
 
05:32:55.590 --> 05:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
equal outcome that means those who are
 
05:32:57.590 --> 05:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
very very high achieving are going to
 
05:32:59.510 --> 05:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
have to be pulled in and those who are
 
05:33:01.110 --> 05:33:01.120 align:start position:0%
very low achieving are going to have to
 
05:33:02.310 --> 05:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
be brought up
 
05:33:04.948 --> 05:33:04.958 align:start position:0%
otherwise leveling everybody's ability
 
05:33:06.470 --> 05:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
and i think one of the things that i
 
05:33:08.310 --> 05:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
remember when i was a teacher was we
 
05:33:10.548 --> 05:33:10.558 align:start position:0%
don't teach to what is fair for
 
05:33:12.390 --> 05:33:12.400 align:start position:0%
everybody we teach to what everybody
 
05:33:12.400 --> 05:33:13.670 align:start position:0%
everybody we teach to what everybody
needs

05:33:13.670 --> 05:33:13.680 align:start position:0%
needs
 
05:33:15.990 --> 05:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
so in this particular instance i would
 
05:33:17.030 --> 05:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
take uh
 
05:33:19.110 --> 05:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
issue with that entire thing is it does
 
05:33:22.548 --> 05:33:22.558 align:start position:0%
not go to the actual uh support of
 
05:33:24.628 --> 05:33:24.638 align:start position:0%
people learning it goes to the support
 
05:33:28.070 --> 05:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
of people learning all at the same level
 
05:33:31.350 --> 05:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:33.190 --> 05:33:33.200 align:start position:0%
further questions represent woodcock
 
05:33:34.788 --> 05:33:34.798 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
05:33:36.070 --> 05:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you for taking my
 
05:33:38.070 --> 05:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
question thank you as i'm reading the
 
05:33:41.590 --> 05:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
the bold section of bull did i guess
 
05:33:44.470 --> 05:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
section of the proposed uh bill change
 
05:33:44.480 --> 05:33:45.430 align:start position:0%
section of the proposed uh bill change
yes

05:33:45.430 --> 05:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:33:46.868 --> 05:33:46.878 align:start position:0%
i'm taking back when i get to the part
 
05:33:49.030 --> 05:33:49.040 align:start position:0%
that says any rule requiring school to
 
05:33:51.430 --> 05:33:51.440 align:start position:0%
adopt the policy concerning
 
05:33:53.750 --> 05:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
culture and climate could you talk about
 
05:33:56.948 --> 05:33:56.958 align:start position:0%
prior to that shall not adopt uh would
 
05:33:58.070 --> 05:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
would you
 
05:33:59.910 --> 05:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
so i may have some leniency or some
 
05:34:01.990 --> 05:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
latitude here rather than lead would you
 
05:34:03.110 --> 05:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
say that
 
05:34:12.070 --> 05:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:14.708 --> 05:34:14.718 align:start position:0%
i don't know what would be included in
 
05:34:16.548 --> 05:34:16.558 align:start position:0%
that i i think i know where you're going
 
05:34:19.190 --> 05:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
on the idea of you want to protect the
 
05:34:20.470 --> 05:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
the children you know i just want to
 
05:34:21.990 --> 05:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
know if you think climate bullying's in
 
05:34:24.708 --> 05:34:24.718 align:start position:0%
climate i i wouldn't i would so bullying
 
05:34:25.990 --> 05:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
is not there
 
05:34:28.708 --> 05:34:28.718 align:start position:0%
was it would discrimination be there
 
05:34:31.030 --> 05:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
i don't hypothetically no it's not there
 
05:34:33.350 --> 05:34:33.360 align:start position:0%
in there so discrimination
 
05:34:35.270 --> 05:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
and bullying those are not in climate
 
05:34:37.430 --> 05:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
items in the school
 
05:34:40.150 --> 05:34:40.160 align:start position:0%
i don't see them in there no
 
05:34:41.510 --> 05:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
okay would they be in the culture of the
 
05:34:41.520 --> 05:34:42.868 align:start position:0%
okay would they be in the culture of the
school

05:34:42.868 --> 05:34:42.878 align:start position:0%
school
 
05:34:45.350 --> 05:34:45.360 align:start position:0%
um i don't know that they would be in
 
05:34:47.670 --> 05:34:47.680 align:start position:0%
the culture of the school i'm not really
 
05:34:49.030 --> 05:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
sure where you're where you're going
 
05:34:50.230 --> 05:34:50.240 align:start position:0%
with this well what i'm trying to
 
05:34:53.590 --> 05:34:53.600 align:start position:0%
discern is things like bullying and
 
05:34:53.600 --> 05:34:55.190 align:start position:0%
discern is things like bullying and
discrimination

05:34:55.190 --> 05:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
discrimination
 
05:34:56.470 --> 05:34:56.480 align:start position:0%
we seem to be
 
05:34:58.788 --> 05:34:58.798 align:start position:0%
uh in the culture of a school you are
 
05:35:00.628 --> 05:35:00.638 align:start position:0%
prohibiting school boys from adopting
 
05:35:03.910 --> 05:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
any policy concerning them no i'm not
 
05:35:05.750 --> 05:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
there shall not a doctor enforce any
 
05:35:07.590 --> 05:35:07.600 align:start position:0%
rule requiring schools
 
05:35:09.430 --> 05:35:09.440 align:start position:0%
to adopt the policy concerning cultural
 
05:35:11.270 --> 05:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
climate so i'm asking you correct what's
 
05:35:13.030 --> 05:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
in there correct culture and climate in
 
05:35:15.190 --> 05:35:15.200 align:start position:0%
here none of which you what you asked me
 
05:35:17.350 --> 05:35:17.360 align:start position:0%
of is in here all of which you asked me
 
05:35:19.750 --> 05:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
of are currently illegal already so it's
 
05:35:21.670 --> 05:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
not a question it's somewhere else like
 
05:35:23.830 --> 05:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
i said this is redundant
 
05:35:26.230 --> 05:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
so my point is was
 
05:35:29.510 --> 05:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
if you have a school board policies
 
05:35:32.070 --> 05:35:32.080 align:start position:0%
that deal with discrimination or the
 
05:35:34.470 --> 05:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
ability not to discriminate
 
05:35:35.670 --> 05:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
or if you have
 
05:35:37.190 --> 05:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
school board policy to deal with
 
05:35:38.628 --> 05:35:38.638 align:start position:0%
bullying or
 
05:35:40.390 --> 05:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
rules and procedures in school not the
 
05:35:40.400 --> 05:35:41.270 align:start position:0%
rules and procedures in school not the
bully

05:35:41.270 --> 05:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
bully
 
05:35:43.030 --> 05:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
because they all impact the climate and
 
05:35:46.070 --> 05:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
culture of that schoolhouse
 
05:35:48.310 --> 05:35:48.320 align:start position:0%
your bill as i see it says that those
 
05:35:50.070 --> 05:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
those should not be there i see i see
 
05:35:51.430 --> 05:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
where you're going okay
 
05:35:53.990 --> 05:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
um that's not the intent of what i'm
 
05:35:55.590 --> 05:35:55.600 align:start position:0%
doing here
 
05:35:58.310 --> 05:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
obviously i i don't want to
 
05:36:00.150 --> 05:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
i don't want this to
 
05:36:02.948 --> 05:36:02.958 align:start position:0%
uh hamstring stop or
 
05:36:02.958 --> 05:36:04.150 align:start position:0%
uh hamstring stop or
curtail

05:36:04.150 --> 05:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
curtail
 
05:36:07.430 --> 05:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
any particular school or school board
 
05:36:09.110 --> 05:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
from doing what they
 
05:36:11.990 --> 05:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
deem appropriate for their children in
 
05:36:12.000 --> 05:36:12.788 align:start position:0%
deem appropriate for their children in
their

05:36:12.788 --> 05:36:12.798 align:start position:0%
their
 
05:36:15.510 --> 05:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
area so that's not the intent of this
 
05:36:17.830 --> 05:36:17.840 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't believe
 
05:36:24.390 --> 05:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:26.708 --> 05:36:26.718 align:start position:0%
adopting those policies or
 
05:36:28.788 --> 05:36:28.798 align:start position:0%
agreeing on those policies
 
05:36:31.190 --> 05:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
this is supposed to mean that the
 
05:36:34.150 --> 05:36:34.160 align:start position:0%
department of education will not require
 
05:36:37.910 --> 05:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
it or enforce it if it is not there
 
05:36:42.868 --> 05:36:42.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:45.430 --> 05:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
thank you sir um well i guess my point
 
05:36:47.510 --> 05:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
is that's not what it says uh and i
 
05:36:49.510 --> 05:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
think you'd be hard-pressed to go into
 
05:36:51.190 --> 05:36:51.200 align:start position:0%
any school
 
05:36:53.750 --> 05:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
in this state and talk to any teacher
 
05:36:55.670 --> 05:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
administrator and ask them if they
 
05:36:58.470 --> 05:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
believe that bullying and discrimination
 
05:37:01.190 --> 05:37:01.200 align:start position:0%
are not part and parcel of the culture
 
05:37:03.270 --> 05:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
of that school and that there needs to
 
05:37:05.430 --> 05:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
be school board policies that are
 
05:37:07.830 --> 05:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
enforceable to create a better culture
 
05:37:09.510 --> 05:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
and climate in that school
 
05:37:09.520 --> 05:37:10.470 align:start position:0%
and climate in that school
again

05:37:10.470 --> 05:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
again
 
05:37:13.110 --> 05:37:13.120 align:start position:0%
bullying is illegal and it's in every
 
05:37:14.868 --> 05:37:14.878 align:start position:0%
handbook pretty much of every school
 
05:37:17.110 --> 05:37:17.120 align:start position:0%
that you can't so i
 
05:37:19.190 --> 05:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
i i i understand what you're saying and
 
05:37:21.910 --> 05:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
i don't want the restriction if if
 
05:37:25.670 --> 05:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
if that is the opinion eventually of
 
05:37:27.270 --> 05:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
05:37:29.990 --> 05:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
i'd be more than happy to
 
05:37:31.910 --> 05:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
have the wording changed so that it
 
05:37:34.548 --> 05:37:34.558 align:start position:0%
doesn't do what you're describing
 
05:37:34.558 --> 05:37:35.670 align:start position:0%
doesn't do what you're describing
okay

05:37:35.670 --> 05:37:35.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:37:36.948 --> 05:37:36.958 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
05:37:38.948 --> 05:37:38.958 align:start position:0%
thank you welcome further further
 
05:37:42.070 --> 05:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:43.590 --> 05:37:43.600 align:start position:0%
not seeing thank you yes right
 
05:37:45.110 --> 05:37:45.120 align:start position:0%
representative moffitt
 
05:37:46.788 --> 05:37:46.798 align:start position:0%
thank you miss sheriff i'm trying to
 
05:37:48.310 --> 05:37:48.320 align:start position:0%
understand the intent here and tell me
 
05:37:49.830 --> 05:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
if if this is
 
05:37:52.628 --> 05:37:52.638 align:start position:0%
if i'm understanding it in this way
 
05:37:56.868 --> 05:37:56.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:58.548 --> 05:37:58.558 align:start position:0%
let me put it this way you don't want to
 
05:38:02.310 --> 05:38:02.320 align:start position:0%
see the state board or doe
 
05:38:02.320 --> 05:38:06.948 align:start position:0%
see the state board or doe
favor

05:38:06.948 --> 05:38:06.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:08.548 --> 05:38:08.558 align:start position:0%
what you don't want to see happen is the
 
05:38:11.270 --> 05:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
state board or doe uh
 
05:38:13.430 --> 05:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
promoting or supporting
 
05:38:15.590 --> 05:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
values or approaches that
 
05:38:18.708 --> 05:38:18.718 align:start position:0%
don't have community consensus support
 
05:38:20.628 --> 05:38:20.638 align:start position:0%
does that
 
05:38:24.230 --> 05:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
yes and and i'll explain it uh
 
05:38:26.470 --> 05:38:26.480 align:start position:0%
in a hypothetical
 
05:38:26.480 --> 05:38:28.150 align:start position:0%
in a hypothetical
okay

05:38:28.150 --> 05:38:28.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:38:32.628 --> 05:38:32.638 align:start position:0%
the the climate and culture section here
 
05:38:34.230 --> 05:38:34.240 align:start position:0%
is is
 
05:38:37.030 --> 05:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
seems to be a redundancy and a catch-all
 
05:38:39.030 --> 05:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
and and the reason it makes me
 
05:38:41.190 --> 05:38:41.200 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable is because it has been
 
05:38:44.070 --> 05:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
adopted by a bureaucracy
 
05:38:46.230 --> 05:38:46.240 align:start position:0%
that bureaucracy theoretically can
 
05:38:46.240 --> 05:38:47.110 align:start position:0%
that bureaucracy theoretically can
change

05:38:47.110 --> 05:38:47.120 align:start position:0%
change
 
05:38:49.110 --> 05:38:49.120 align:start position:0%
tomorrow climate and culture
 
05:38:50.548 --> 05:38:50.558 align:start position:0%
could be
 
05:38:52.708 --> 05:38:52.718 align:start position:0%
everybody has to wear a mask
 
05:38:55.350 --> 05:38:55.360 align:start position:0%
tomorrow's climate and culture could be
 
05:39:00.628 --> 05:39:00.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:02.708 --> 05:39:02.718 align:start position:0%
do you see one it's just an arbitrary
 
05:39:04.948 --> 05:39:04.958 align:start position:0%
thing that was put in here
 
05:39:07.990 --> 05:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
it didn't get it there was no hearing
 
05:39:10.788 --> 05:39:10.798 align:start position:0%
like this to discuss the merits of it
 
05:39:12.548 --> 05:39:12.558 align:start position:0%
when you go into gel car and this is my
 
05:39:14.310 --> 05:39:14.320 align:start position:0%
understanding i'm learning these things
 
05:39:16.868 --> 05:39:16.878 align:start position:0%
for for this but from my understanding
 
05:39:19.110 --> 05:39:19.120 align:start position:0%
is is gel card doesn't really do
 
05:39:22.470 --> 05:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
anything as far as what the rule is they
 
05:39:24.628 --> 05:39:24.638 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that it is proper
 
05:39:27.350 --> 05:39:27.360 align:start position:0%
and crosses the eyes and dots the t's
 
05:39:29.750 --> 05:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
they don't have the ability to say no
 
05:39:31.750 --> 05:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
this is bad we're taking it out or this
 
05:39:33.750 --> 05:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
is good or we should amend
 
05:39:33.760 --> 05:39:35.030 align:start position:0%
is good or we should amend
so

05:39:35.030 --> 05:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:39:36.868 --> 05:39:36.878 align:start position:0%
to work on this
 
05:39:40.310 --> 05:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
this was the only avenue that i had
 
05:39:43.270 --> 05:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
yes thank you thank you
 
05:39:45.590 --> 05:39:45.600 align:start position:0%

discussion about what climate and
 
05:41:14.230 --> 05:41:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:16.470 --> 05:41:16.480 align:start position:0%
the governor had put together a task
 
05:41:18.470 --> 05:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
force on school safety that came out
 
05:41:19.830 --> 05:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
with a report
 
05:41:22.548 --> 05:41:22.558 align:start position:0%
in 2018
 
05:41:24.868 --> 05:41:24.878 align:start position:0%
and in that report um and it is
 
05:41:24.878 --> 05:41:26.548 align:start position:0%
and in that report um and it is
available

05:41:26.548 --> 05:41:26.558 align:start position:0%
available
 
05:41:28.548 --> 05:41:28.558 align:start position:0%
online and if anybody would like i'm
 
05:41:31.750 --> 05:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
more than happy to send the link to it
 
05:41:31.760 --> 05:41:32.948 align:start position:0%
more than happy to send the link to it
um

05:41:32.948 --> 05:41:32.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:41:36.150 --> 05:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
a school's culture is the set of norms
 
05:41:38.948 --> 05:41:38.958 align:start position:0%
that defines the behavior inside the
 
05:41:41.670 --> 05:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
school and largely determines what is
 
05:41:44.470 --> 05:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
considered socially acceptable behavior
 
05:41:46.310 --> 05:41:46.320 align:start position:0%
between classmates
 
05:41:51.510 --> 05:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:54.070 --> 05:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
culture is significantly important
 
05:41:57.590 --> 05:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
to the social emotional and academic
 
05:41:57.600 --> 05:42:00.230 align:start position:0%
to the social emotional and academic
success

05:42:00.230 --> 05:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
success
 
05:42:06.708 --> 05:42:06.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:09.110 --> 05:42:09.120 align:start position:0%
cult you know a positive culture in a
 
05:42:11.350 --> 05:42:11.360 align:start position:0%
school if a school has a pro
 
05:42:13.430 --> 05:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
positive culture
 
05:42:15.190 --> 05:42:15.200 align:start position:0%
or a negative culture
 
05:42:15.200 --> 05:42:16.470 align:start position:0%
or a negative culture
um

05:42:16.470 --> 05:42:16.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:42:21.430 --> 05:42:21.440 align:start position:0%
it's a great predictor of dropout rates
 
05:42:21.440 --> 05:42:23.350 align:start position:0%
it's a great predictor of dropout rates
absenteeism

05:42:23.350 --> 05:42:23.360 align:start position:0%
absenteeism
 
05:42:23.360 --> 05:42:25.190 align:start position:0%
absenteeism
truancy

05:42:25.190 --> 05:42:25.200 align:start position:0%

05:42:25.200 --> 05:42:26.708 align:start position:0%
truancy
suspension

05:42:26.708 --> 05:42:26.718 align:start position:0%
suspension
 
05:42:28.150 --> 05:42:28.160 align:start position:0%

violence

05:42:29.270 --> 05:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
violence
 
05:42:33.350 --> 05:42:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:35.510 --> 05:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
and positive school culture is closely
 
05:42:38.628 --> 05:42:38.638 align:start position:0%
associated with pro-social motivation
 
05:42:40.868 --> 05:42:40.878 align:start position:0%
academic motivation
 
05:42:43.430 --> 05:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
self-esteem conflict resolution and
 
05:42:48.628 --> 05:42:48.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:48.638 --> 05:42:50.390 align:start position:0%
 
additionally

05:42:50.390 --> 05:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
additionally
 
05:42:50.400 --> 05:42:52.310 align:start position:0%
additionally
positive

05:42:52.310 --> 05:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
positive
 
05:42:55.510 --> 05:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
school cultures have been linked to
 
05:42:55.520 --> 05:42:57.190 align:start position:0%
school cultures have been linked to
as

05:42:57.190 --> 05:42:57.200 align:start position:0%
as
 
05:43:00.788 --> 05:43:00.798 align:start position:0%
representative woodpock alluded to
 
05:43:03.430 --> 05:43:03.440 align:start position:0%
a reduced incidence of bullying
 
05:43:06.788 --> 05:43:06.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:12.390 --> 05:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:15.030 --> 05:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
bullying in a school the the increased
 
05:43:17.830 --> 05:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
amount of bullying in a school
 
05:43:21.350 --> 05:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
is one of the main predictors of
 
05:43:26.548 --> 05:43:26.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:30.708 --> 05:43:30.718 align:start position:0%
and a 2010 study correlated a student's
 
05:43:33.270 --> 05:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
perceived sense of security which is
 
05:43:35.190 --> 05:43:35.200 align:start position:0%
also part of the culture and community
 
05:43:38.310 --> 05:43:38.320 align:start position:0%
having a safe environment if students
 
05:43:40.548 --> 05:43:40.558 align:start position:0%
felt safe
 
05:43:43.270 --> 05:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
in their culture in the school there was
 
05:43:44.548 --> 05:43:44.558 align:start position:0%
an 18
 
05:43:44.558 --> 05:43:45.990 align:start position:0%
an 18
increase

05:43:45.990 --> 05:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
increase
 
05:43:48.868 --> 05:43:48.878 align:start position:0%
in student score performance
 
05:43:51.510 --> 05:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
so the culture and climate is directly
 
05:43:54.310 --> 05:43:54.320 align:start position:0%
linked to academic performance as well
 
05:43:55.990 --> 05:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
as social
 
05:44:00.230 --> 05:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:02.470 --> 05:44:02.480 align:start position:0%
and as you know mentioned about the
 
05:44:04.628 --> 05:44:04.638 align:start position:0%
bullying um
 
05:44:07.030 --> 05:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
not only is it associated with violence
 
05:44:09.110 --> 05:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
but it's also associated with high
 
05:44:09.120 --> 05:44:10.070 align:start position:0%
but it's also associated with high
levels

05:44:10.070 --> 05:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
levels
 
05:44:14.390 --> 05:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:16.948 --> 05:44:16.958 align:start position:0%
there's no direct causal link so no
 
05:44:19.510 --> 05:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
one's done a study that says yes
 
05:44:21.510 --> 05:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
this child was bullied there was
 
05:44:23.510 --> 05:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
suicidal behavior there's not a direct
 
05:44:27.990 --> 05:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:30.150 --> 05:44:30.160 align:start position:0%
but what they have found that
 
05:44:33.190 --> 05:44:33.200 align:start position:0%
involvement in bullying if the child has
 
05:44:35.590 --> 05:44:35.600 align:start position:0%
other risk factors it increases the
 
05:44:37.670 --> 05:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
chances that the young person will
 
05:44:40.868 --> 05:44:40.878 align:start position:0%
engage in suicide related behaviors and
 
05:44:42.548 --> 05:44:42.558 align:start position:0%
i have provided
 
05:44:46.788 --> 05:44:46.798 align:start position:0%
the citation for that study
 
05:44:49.350 --> 05:44:49.360 align:start position:0%
currently in new hampshire suicide is
 
05:44:52.628 --> 05:44:52.638 align:start position:0%
the second leading cause of death
 
05:44:56.470 --> 05:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
for young people and young adults
 
05:45:02.310 --> 05:45:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:04.788 --> 05:45:04.798 align:start position:0%
so any action that new hampshire can
 
05:45:04.798 --> 05:45:05.670 align:start position:0%
so any action that new hampshire can
take

05:45:05.670 --> 05:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
take
 
05:45:08.868 --> 05:45:08.878 align:start position:0%
to reduce the incidences of suicide and
 
05:45:10.788 --> 05:45:10.798 align:start position:0%
violence among young people is
 
05:45:13.910 --> 05:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
incredibly important
 
05:45:16.070 --> 05:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
our state has a vested
 
05:45:16.080 --> 05:45:17.430 align:start position:0%
our state has a vested
interest

05:45:17.430 --> 05:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
interest
 
05:45:19.750 --> 05:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
in assisting the schools
 
05:45:22.948 --> 05:45:22.958 align:start position:0%
and cultivating a positive safe culture
 
05:45:24.708 --> 05:45:24.718 align:start position:0%
and climate
 
05:45:28.230 --> 05:45:28.240 align:start position:0%
throughout each school system
 
05:45:30.708 --> 05:45:30.718 align:start position:0%
house bill 1198 would prevent the
 
05:45:32.628 --> 05:45:32.638 align:start position:0%
department of education
 
05:45:35.590 --> 05:45:35.600 align:start position:0%
from doing this important work
 
05:45:37.590 --> 05:45:37.600 align:start position:0%
and so for these reasons nami new
 
05:45:40.868 --> 05:45:40.878 align:start position:0%
hampshire requested the committee
 
05:45:44.070 --> 05:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
um vote inexpedient to legislate on
 
05:45:46.948 --> 05:45:46.958 align:start position:0%
house bill 1198 and i will take any
 
05:45:48.788 --> 05:45:48.798 align:start position:0%
questions that the committee has thank
 
05:45:50.868 --> 05:45:50.878 align:start position:0%
you very much are there any questions
 
05:45:54.470 --> 05:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:56.230 --> 05:45:56.240 align:start position:0%
not seeing any hands thank you very much
 
05:45:58.548 --> 05:45:58.558 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
05:46:01.430 --> 05:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh next card which we have is
 
05:46:21.350 --> 05:46:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:22.868 --> 05:46:22.878 align:start position:0%
good afternoon members of the committee
 
05:46:24.948 --> 05:46:24.958 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for having me
 
05:46:26.150 --> 05:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
i'm here
 
05:46:28.310 --> 05:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
my name is emma savini i represent new
 
05:46:30.548 --> 05:46:30.558 align:start position:0%
futures i am the children's behavioral
 
05:46:32.548 --> 05:46:32.558 align:start position:0%
health policy coordinator there
 
05:46:35.110 --> 05:46:35.120 align:start position:0%
new futures is a non-partisan nonprofit

wellness of all granite staters
 
05:46:43.910 --> 05:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
new futures opposes this bill because it
 
05:46:45.990 --> 05:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
may erode the progress that our state
 
05:46:47.590 --> 05:46:47.600 align:start position:0%
has made toward implementing the
 
05:46:49.430 --> 05:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
multi-tiered system of support for
 
05:46:51.670 --> 05:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
behavioral health and wellness commonly
 
05:46:54.070 --> 05:46:54.080 align:start position:0%
referred to as mtssb
 
05:46:55.910 --> 05:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
a critical part of our system of care
 
05:46:57.430 --> 05:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
that creates a positive learning
 
05:47:00.788 --> 05:47:00.798 align:start position:0%
environment for all students
 
05:47:02.548 --> 05:47:02.558 align:start position:0%
mtssb is an
 
05:47:05.110 --> 05:47:05.120 align:start position:0%
evidence-based comprehensive system of
 
05:47:07.510 --> 05:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
social and behavioral and emotional
 
05:47:09.670 --> 05:47:09.680 align:start position:0%
supports to promote student wellness and
 
05:47:11.670 --> 05:47:11.680 align:start position:0%
improve engagement and learning it's a
 
05:47:14.230 --> 05:47:14.240 align:start position:0%
three-tiered system at the bottom of the
 
05:47:17.030 --> 05:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
kind of pyramid if you would imagine it
 
05:47:18.310 --> 05:47:18.320 align:start position:0%
tier one
 
05:47:20.070 --> 05:47:20.080 align:start position:0%
are interventions that a school can
 
05:47:21.830 --> 05:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
implement to improve the social and
 
05:47:24.788 --> 05:47:24.798 align:start position:0%
emotional wellness for all students
 
05:47:26.788 --> 05:47:26.798 align:start position:0%
the second tier which represents fewer
 
05:47:28.628 --> 05:47:28.638 align:start position:0%
students is interventions that the
 
05:47:30.070 --> 05:47:30.080 align:start position:0%
school can implement
 
05:47:33.750 --> 05:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
to improve the wellness and social
 
05:47:35.990 --> 05:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
social wellness of students who need
 
05:47:37.990 --> 05:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
more severe interventions and then at
 
05:47:40.868 --> 05:47:40.878 align:start position:0%
the top of the tier tier three
 
05:47:42.230 --> 05:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
are interventions that the school
 
05:47:44.948 --> 05:47:44.958 align:start position:0%
implements for students who need
 
05:47:46.868 --> 05:47:46.878 align:start position:0%
more intensive treatments and
 
05:47:49.190 --> 05:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
interventions that that to improve their
 
05:47:51.430 --> 05:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
social and emotional wellness
 
05:47:53.670 --> 05:47:53.680 align:start position:0%
um the culture and climate school in of
 
05:47:57.510 --> 05:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
schools and mtssb form almost a cycle in
 
05:47:59.270 --> 05:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
creating a positive culture and climate
 
05:48:01.110 --> 05:48:01.120 align:start position:0%
in schools a positive culture and
 
05:48:03.670 --> 05:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
climate lends itself to proper and
 
05:48:06.708 --> 05:48:06.718 align:start position:0%
better mtssb implementation and then
 
05:48:09.830 --> 05:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
implementing mtssb then increases the
 
05:48:09.840 --> 05:48:11.590 align:start position:0%
implementing mtssb then increases the
positivity

05:48:11.590 --> 05:48:11.600 align:start position:0%
positivity
 
05:48:13.190 --> 05:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
for culture and climate and a better
 
05:48:19.830 --> 05:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:21.430 --> 05:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
if passed
 
05:48:24.230 --> 05:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
house bill 1198 could erode the progress

05:48:31.030 --> 05:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
the rule cited by the bill sponsor
 
05:48:31.040 --> 05:48:32.110 align:start position:0%
the rule cited by the bill sponsor
rule

05:48:32.110 --> 05:48:32.120 align:start position:0%
rule
 
05:48:32.120 --> 05:48:33.830 align:start position:0%
rule
306.06

05:48:33.830 --> 05:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
306.06
 
05:48:36.628 --> 05:48:36.638 align:start position:0%
is the minimum standard for culture and
 
05:48:40.150 --> 05:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
climate that gives kind of the basis for
 
05:48:42.708 --> 05:48:42.718 align:start position:0%
mtssb implementation
 
05:48:44.708 --> 05:48:44.718 align:start position:0%
um eliminating this rule altogether
 
05:48:46.070 --> 05:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
would redu
 
05:48:47.830 --> 05:48:47.840 align:start position:0%
remove that minimum standard and
 
05:48:49.350 --> 05:48:49.360 align:start position:0%
therefore schools
 
05:48:50.230 --> 05:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
would be
 
05:48:52.548 --> 05:48:52.558 align:start position:0%
likely less likely to
 
05:48:55.110 --> 05:48:55.120 align:start position:0%
implement mtssb
 
05:48:56.788 --> 05:48:56.798 align:start position:0%
schools provide students with much more
 
05:48:58.948 --> 05:48:58.958 align:start position:0%
than just the in education in the
 
05:49:01.350 --> 05:49:01.360 align:start position:0%
traditional sense like reading and math
 
05:49:02.788 --> 05:49:02.798 align:start position:0%
schools are really important for
 
05:49:04.390 --> 05:49:04.400 align:start position:0%
students to
 
05:49:05.750 --> 05:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
get a foundation in social and
 
05:49:07.510 --> 05:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
behavioral learning so that they can be
 
05:49:09.510 --> 05:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
successful later on
 
05:49:11.190 --> 05:49:11.200 align:start position:0%
the culture and climate in schools is
 
05:49:13.830 --> 05:49:13.840 align:start position:0%
crucial to providing a safe and healthy
 
05:49:15.670 --> 05:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
environment for students to learn how to
 
05:49:17.030 --> 05:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
interact with
 
05:49:19.350 --> 05:49:19.360 align:start position:0%
other peers and their
 
05:49:21.590 --> 05:49:21.600 align:start position:0%
you know teachers and administrators
 
05:49:23.590 --> 05:49:23.600 align:start position:0%
especially with covid where it's an
 
05:49:25.990 --> 05:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
extremely tumultuous time programs like
 
05:49:28.788 --> 05:49:28.798 align:start position:0%
mtssb give students a healthy way to
 
05:49:32.150 --> 05:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
learn how to cope with large changes and
 
05:49:35.110 --> 05:49:35.120 align:start position:0%
major stressors in their lives
 
05:49:37.190 --> 05:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
by removing the minimum standard for a
 
05:49:39.240 --> 05:49:39.250 align:start position:0%
culture and climate in schools
 
05:49:39.250 --> 05:49:40.390 align:start position:0%
culture and climate in schools

[Music]
 
05:49:43.430 --> 05:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
this mtssb and other similar programs
 
05:49:44.390 --> 05:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
will be
 
05:49:46.390 --> 05:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
less likely to be implemented
 
05:49:49.110 --> 05:49:49.120 align:start position:0%
and schools will no longer be the
 
05:49:51.190 --> 05:49:51.200 align:start position:0%
safe place for students to foster social
 
05:49:53.830 --> 05:49:53.840 align:start position:0%
emotional and behavioral learning that
 
05:49:56.708 --> 05:49:56.718 align:start position:0%
they need to grow into successful adults
 
05:49:58.708 --> 05:49:58.718 align:start position:0%
for those reasons new future strongly
 
05:50:00.390 --> 05:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
urges the committee to vote house bill
 
05:50:03.510 --> 05:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
1198 and expedient to legislate
 
05:50:05.350 --> 05:50:05.360 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
05:50:07.750 --> 05:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
questions for new futures
 
05:50:09.670 --> 05:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
yes representative cornell
 
05:50:11.190 --> 05:50:11.200 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
05:50:13.350 --> 05:50:13.360 align:start position:0%
question and thank you and
 
05:50:15.350 --> 05:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
holly for reminding us that this came
 
05:50:17.030 --> 05:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
out of the governor's
 
05:50:19.190 --> 05:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
school safety task force and that's what
 
05:50:22.868 --> 05:50:22.878 align:start position:0%
this is a result of well my question is
 
05:50:24.548 --> 05:50:24.558 align:start position:0%
from what i understand and i may be
 
05:50:26.788 --> 05:50:26.798 align:start position:0%
wrong the department of wellness works
 
05:50:29.270 --> 05:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
with school districts across the state
 
05:50:30.830 --> 05:50:30.840 align:start position:0%
to implement
 
05:50:33.910 --> 05:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
mtssb or something similar
 
05:50:36.628 --> 05:50:36.638 align:start position:0%
on how it fits into each particular
 
05:50:39.590 --> 05:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
district so it could be a huge program
 
05:50:41.270 --> 05:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
in one place
 
05:50:44.390 --> 05:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
and a small program in another place
 
05:50:47.110 --> 05:50:47.120 align:start position:0%
depending on what is decided on by the
 
05:50:49.510 --> 05:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
community i'm pretty sure this community
 
05:50:49.520 --> 05:50:50.470 align:start position:0%
community i'm pretty sure this community
input

05:50:50.470 --> 05:50:50.480 align:start position:0%
input
 
05:50:52.310 --> 05:50:52.320 align:start position:0%
into these plans and
 
05:50:55.190 --> 05:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
it's not just something that's thrown in
 
05:50:57.110 --> 05:50:57.120 align:start position:0%
i think it's
 
05:50:59.030 --> 05:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
i think it's actually merrimack that
 
05:51:01.510 --> 05:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
worked on it for five years before they
 
05:51:04.070 --> 05:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
started implementing something and they
 
05:51:05.990 --> 05:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
worked with the community they worked
 
05:51:08.230 --> 05:51:08.240 align:start position:0%
with um the schools they worked with
 
05:51:11.110 --> 05:51:11.120 align:start position:0%
businesses and then they implemented
 
05:51:13.270 --> 05:51:13.280 align:start position:0%
what ship best into their school
 
05:51:17.030 --> 05:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
district and i i think that's what
 
05:51:19.030 --> 05:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
is going on in the state now little by
 
05:51:21.030 --> 05:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
little they're working with areas so
 
05:51:24.070 --> 05:51:24.080 align:start position:0%
taking this out of it would you know
 
05:51:26.628 --> 05:51:26.638 align:start position:0%
undo a lot of the work that's been going
 
05:51:29.110 --> 05:51:29.120 align:start position:0%
on in the state am i right
 
05:51:30.868 --> 05:51:30.878 align:start position:0%
you are exactly thank you so much for
 
05:51:34.948 --> 05:51:34.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:37.190 --> 05:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
the steps are exactly as you as you
 
05:51:39.350 --> 05:51:39.360 align:start position:0%
described the the community and the
 
05:51:40.548 --> 05:51:40.558 align:start position:0%
school district determines that they're
 
05:51:42.788 --> 05:51:42.798 align:start position:0%
going to take part in mtssb there's a
 
05:51:43.910 --> 05:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
period of time where the school
 
05:51:45.910 --> 05:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
determines what types of interventions
 
05:51:47.670 --> 05:51:47.680 align:start position:0%
the school needs what can they improve
 
05:51:49.430 --> 05:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
on their culture and climate and then
 
05:51:51.510 --> 05:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
it's an ongoing process of refining and
 
05:51:53.270 --> 05:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
ensuring that their interventions
 
05:51:54.948 --> 05:51:54.958 align:start position:0%
they're putting in are working they
 
05:51:56.310 --> 05:51:56.320 align:start position:0%
check data to make sure that the
 
05:51:58.150 --> 05:51:58.160 align:start position:0%
interventions are working
 
05:51:59.430 --> 05:51:59.440 align:start position:0%
and reaching those goals that they've
 
05:51:59.440 --> 05:52:02.230 align:start position:0%
and reaching those goals that they've
set

05:52:02.230 --> 05:52:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:04.628 --> 05:52:04.638 align:start position:0%
thank you and i'm sorry that the sponsor
 
05:52:07.510 --> 05:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
didn't stay to hear all that
 
05:52:10.150 --> 05:52:10.160 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
05:52:16.708 --> 05:52:16.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:28.390 --> 05:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:29.750 --> 05:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
thank you committee chair thank you
 
05:52:31.270 --> 05:52:31.280 align:start position:0%
committee members for
 
05:52:33.350 --> 05:52:33.360 align:start position:0%
allowing me to speak on this i just want
 
05:52:35.030 --> 05:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
to start by saying that although i'm a
 
05:52:37.350 --> 05:52:37.360 align:start position:0%
bedford resident now
 
05:52:39.350 --> 05:52:39.360 align:start position:0%
oftentimes when i'm speaking i'm
 
05:52:41.030 --> 05:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
speaking for when my children are in
 
05:52:41.040 --> 05:52:42.230 align:start position:0%
speaking for when my children are in
school

05:52:42.230 --> 05:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
school
 
05:52:44.230 --> 05:52:44.240 align:start position:0%
and they were not always in the bedford
 
05:52:46.070 --> 05:52:46.080 align:start position:0%
school system so i just wanted to make
 
05:52:49.590 --> 05:52:49.600 align:start position:0%
sure that i clarified that so i'm not
 
05:52:52.390 --> 05:52:52.400 align:start position:0%
bashing my school district that i
 
05:52:55.270 --> 05:52:55.280 align:start position:0%
currently live in however what i will
 
05:52:59.110 --> 05:52:59.120 align:start position:0%
say is that i listen to what the um
 
05:53:01.670 --> 05:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
representative or what um
 
05:53:04.230 --> 05:53:04.240 align:start position:0%
the director for public policy with nami
 
05:53:06.390 --> 05:53:06.400 align:start position:0%
had to say and with regards to what new
 
05:53:09.110 --> 05:53:09.120 align:start position:0%
futures had to say and my concerns is
 
05:53:11.270 --> 05:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
that what is happening in our school
 
05:53:14.150 --> 05:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
system yes we have mtssb
 
05:53:16.708 --> 05:53:16.718 align:start position:0%
and i think it's been hijacked
 
05:53:18.948 --> 05:53:18.958 align:start position:0%
i think that what is happening now is
 
05:53:21.190 --> 05:53:21.200 align:start position:0%
there's a culture and climate that's
 
05:53:23.750 --> 05:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
going on in our school districts that
 
05:53:26.470 --> 05:53:26.480 align:start position:0%
may be put in place by the school boards
 
05:53:29.590 --> 05:53:29.600 align:start position:0%
and not necessarily by the community
 
05:53:32.470 --> 05:53:32.480 align:start position:0%
standards that the constituents that
 
05:53:35.190 --> 05:53:35.200 align:start position:0%
voted those people into office really
 
05:53:37.670 --> 05:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
understand what's going on
 
05:53:41.190 --> 05:53:41.200 align:start position:0%
for instance in bedford schools since we
 
05:53:43.830 --> 05:53:43.840 align:start position:0%
well bedford school specifically but i
 
05:53:45.590 --> 05:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
just checked a couple of other schools
 
05:53:47.750 --> 05:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
districts too
 
05:53:50.390 --> 05:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
would you believe that prior to adopting
 
05:53:52.548 --> 05:53:52.558 align:start position:0%
an mtssb
 
05:53:55.590 --> 05:53:55.600 align:start position:0%
the amount of suicides was much lower
 
05:53:57.750 --> 05:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
than it is today
 
05:54:00.390 --> 05:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
in the few school systems that i checked
 
05:54:02.548 --> 05:54:02.558 align:start position:0%
would you also believe that in the
 
05:54:04.150 --> 05:54:04.160 align:start position:0%
school systems that i checked and i'm
 
05:54:05.590 --> 05:54:05.600 align:start position:0%
more than willing to provide you with
 
05:54:07.590 --> 05:54:07.600 align:start position:0%
this information
 
05:54:10.230 --> 05:54:10.240 align:start position:0%
like i said i was sitting back there and
 
05:54:13.270 --> 05:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
spending a lot of time looking things up
 
05:54:15.430 --> 05:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
would you also believe that
 
05:54:18.150 --> 05:54:18.160 align:start position:0%
right now in bedford new hampshire there
 
05:54:21.990 --> 05:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
is a program for students in our high
 
05:54:22.000 --> 05:54:23.030 align:start position:0%
is a program for students in our high
school

05:54:23.030 --> 05:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
school
 
05:54:23.040 --> 05:54:24.150 align:start position:0%
school
that

05:54:24.150 --> 05:54:24.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:54:27.510 --> 05:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
allows for kids to talk about
 
05:54:27.520 --> 05:54:29.590 align:start position:0%
allows for kids to talk about
maltreatment

05:54:29.590 --> 05:54:29.600 align:start position:0%
maltreatment
 
05:54:31.750 --> 05:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
there has been a couple of um
 
05:54:34.868 --> 05:54:34.878 align:start position:0%
canvassings done of those students
 
05:54:36.868 --> 05:54:36.878 align:start position:0%
one out of five of those students that
 
05:54:39.190 --> 05:54:39.200 align:start position:0%
have identified bullying
 
05:54:39.200 --> 05:54:40.548 align:start position:0%
have identified bullying
or

05:54:40.548 --> 05:54:40.558 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:54:40.558 --> 05:54:42.150 align:start position:0%
or
mis

05:54:42.150 --> 05:54:42.160 align:start position:0%
mis
 
05:54:42.160 --> 05:54:43.430 align:start position:0%
mis
uh

05:54:43.430 --> 05:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:54:45.510 --> 05:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
inappropriateness or anything to that
 
05:54:48.230 --> 05:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
effect suicide ideation would you
 
05:54:50.948 --> 05:54:50.958 align:start position:0%
believe that one in five
 
05:54:53.910 --> 05:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
say they were not a victim
 
05:54:57.990 --> 05:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
but they were basically bullied into
 
05:55:00.470 --> 05:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
identifying themselves as victims
 
05:55:02.510 --> 05:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
so that's the problem with
 
05:55:05.750 --> 05:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
mtssb and that is what this
 
05:55:05.760 --> 05:55:06.548 align:start position:0%
mtssb and that is what this
uh

05:55:06.548 --> 05:55:06.558 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:55:09.030 --> 05:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
bill is trying to combat
 
05:55:11.110 --> 05:55:11.120 align:start position:0%
so i believe strongly that
 
05:55:13.670 --> 05:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
discrimination is discrimination
 
05:55:16.390 --> 05:55:16.400 align:start position:0%
culture and climate should never be it
 
05:55:18.150 --> 05:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
that should not be something that we
 
05:55:19.990 --> 05:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
have to talk about
 
05:55:22.708 --> 05:55:22.718 align:start position:0%
discrimination is discrimination so the
 
05:55:25.590 --> 05:55:25.600 align:start position:0%
bottom line is is if you have a history
 
05:55:27.910 --> 05:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
of abuse and neglect and your child and
 
05:55:29.590 --> 05:55:29.600 align:start position:0%
your other child does not have a history
 
05:55:31.510 --> 05:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
of abuse and neglect they should not be
 
05:55:33.270 --> 05:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
identified differently
 
05:55:36.390 --> 05:55:36.400 align:start position:0%
and the more inclusive we try to become
 
05:55:38.310 --> 05:55:38.320 align:start position:0%
the more diversive we are that's
 
05:55:40.470 --> 05:55:40.480 align:start position:0%
happening to our government our our
 
05:55:40.480 --> 05:55:41.670 align:start position:0%
happening to our government our our
children

05:55:41.670 --> 05:55:41.680 align:start position:0%
children
 
05:55:43.750 --> 05:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:55:45.510 --> 05:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
questions for the presenter yes
 
05:55:47.270 --> 05:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
representative cornell thank you could
 
05:55:49.190 --> 05:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
you please tell me how you got people's
 
05:55:51.110 --> 05:55:51.120 align:start position:0%
private information on how they reply to
 
05:55:53.030 --> 05:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
the surveys
 
05:55:55.590 --> 05:55:55.600 align:start position:0%
when you said one in five um
 
05:55:57.910 --> 05:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
admitted that they were bullied into
 
05:56:00.390 --> 05:56:00.400 align:start position:0%
giving the answer that they gave
 
05:56:01.910 --> 05:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
how do you find that out so there's a
 
05:56:03.270 --> 05:56:03.280 align:start position:0%
facebook group
 
05:56:05.590 --> 05:56:05.600 align:start position:0%
there's a facebook mind thank you
 
05:56:08.150 --> 05:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
well no it's just that the children have
 
05:56:09.510 --> 05:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
said that
 
05:56:09.520 --> 05:56:11.430 align:start position:0%
said that
okay

05:56:11.430 --> 05:56:11.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:56:14.390 --> 05:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:16.470 --> 05:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any other cards for
 
05:56:20.230 --> 05:56:20.240 align:start position:0%
this uh particular bill
 
05:56:28.470 --> 05:56:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:31.990 --> 05:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:33.750 --> 05:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
he might be trying to say something but
 
05:56:33.760 --> 05:56:34.868 align:start position:0%
he might be trying to say something but
he's

05:56:34.868 --> 05:56:34.878 align:start position:0%
he's
 
05:56:36.708 --> 05:56:36.718 align:start position:0%
saying the wrong way
 
05:56:39.750 --> 05:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
you know i have a daughter
 
05:56:42.070 --> 05:56:42.080 align:start position:0%
a granddaughter who
 
05:56:44.070 --> 05:56:44.080 align:start position:0%
was chased out of the school and that's
 
05:56:45.830 --> 05:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
why she went to saint j because she was
 
05:56:48.150 --> 05:56:48.160 align:start position:0%
bullied that was the culture of that
 
05:56:50.310 --> 05:56:50.320 align:start position:0%
athletic program she was in
 
05:56:52.230 --> 05:56:52.240 align:start position:0%
you know if you're the top dog
 
05:56:55.030 --> 05:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
go after the top dog
 
05:56:58.230 --> 05:56:58.240 align:start position:0%
then when i was in alaska and kodiak
 
05:57:00.070 --> 05:57:00.080 align:start position:0%
the high school there had a reputation
 
05:57:02.548 --> 05:57:02.558 align:start position:0%
of having gangs in it
 
05:57:04.788 --> 05:57:04.798 align:start position:0%
and fighting that was the culture of
 
05:57:05.830 --> 05:57:05.840 align:start position:0%
that school
 
05:57:08.070 --> 05:57:08.080 align:start position:0%
that was the climate of that school
 
05:57:08.080 --> 05:57:09.190 align:start position:0%
that was the climate of that school
so

05:57:09.190 --> 05:57:09.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:57:10.868 --> 05:57:10.878 align:start position:0%
we want to
 
05:57:13.430 --> 05:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
put in place a climate which is contrary
 
05:57:14.470 --> 05:57:14.480 align:start position:0%
to that
 
05:57:17.670 --> 05:57:17.680 align:start position:0%
and do we do it to our board policies
 
05:57:21.750 --> 05:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:23.830 --> 05:57:23.840 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i i think that was way off the
 
05:57:35.350 --> 05:57:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:37.590 --> 05:57:37.600 align:start position:0%
yeah good thank you very much
 
05:57:42.628 --> 05:57:42.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:44.230 --> 05:57:44.240 align:start position:0%
not everybody has a lieutenant colonel
 
05:57:49.910 --> 05:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:04.310 --> 05:58:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:05.510 --> 05:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
but i don't know if you read these
 
05:58:07.430 --> 05:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
things right here they're pretty broad
 
05:58:10.150 --> 05:58:10.160 align:start position:0%
they're not dealing with
 
05:58:11.830 --> 05:58:11.840 align:start position:0%
we got going on in schools right
 
05:58:26.470 --> 05:58:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:26.480 --> 05:58:44.230 align:start position:0%

you know by the teachers by the way and
um

05:59:21.030 --> 05:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:59:22.868 --> 05:59:22.878 align:start position:0%
he uh he says you know by 10 o'clock or
 
05:59:24.548 --> 05:59:24.558 align:start position:0%

nausea stuff like that and uh you know
 
05:59:32.708 --> 05:59:32.718 align:start position:0%
that's that's not a good uh good climate
 
05:59:35.110 --> 05:59:35.120 align:start position:0%
to try to teach a kid and he gets home
 
05:59:36.548 --> 05:59:36.558 align:start position:0%
from school and it takes him an hour for
 
05:59:38.470 --> 05:59:38.480 align:start position:0%
the headache and the nausea to go away
 
05:59:40.868 --> 05:59:40.878 align:start position:0%

teachers and stuff and and if you think
 
05:59:47.110 --> 05:59:47.120 align:start position:0%
we don't have bullies for teachers in
 
05:59:48.708 --> 05:59:48.718 align:start position:0%
this state
 
05:59:50.470 --> 05:59:50.480 align:start position:0%

and
 
06:00:06.390 --> 06:00:06.400 align:start position:0%

06:01:42.470 --> 06:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
efficiency has has
 
06:01:44.708 --> 06:01:44.718 align:start position:0%
been assumed in safety harm in
 
06:01:46.548 --> 06:01:46.558 align:start position:0%
parentheses has not been given any
 
06:01:49.030 --> 06:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
serious consideration the current bill
 
06:01:51.670 --> 06:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
empowers parents not the teachers to con
 
06:01:53.990 --> 06:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
consider both and make the best decision
 
06:01:56.150 --> 06:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
for their children based on all current
 
06:01:58.470 --> 06:01:58.480 align:start position:0%
current available data uh he goes on to
 
06:02:00.310 --> 06:02:00.320 align:start position:0%
to say that you know there are no
 
06:02:02.470 --> 06:02:02.480 align:start position:0%
scientific studies i was in i was
 
06:02:04.548 --> 06:02:04.558 align:start position:0%
subbing in health and human services the
 
06:02:05.590 --> 06:02:05.600 align:start position:0%
other day and
 
06:02:07.110 --> 06:02:07.120 align:start position:0%
another doctor stood up and said the
 
06:02:09.750 --> 06:02:09.760 align:start position:0%
same thing you know uh you know and as a
 
06:02:12.230 --> 06:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
matter of fact he he asked the question
 
06:02:14.470 --> 06:02:14.480 align:start position:0%
how many children without underlying
 
06:02:14.480 --> 06:02:15.590 align:start position:0%
how many children without underlying
causes

06:02:15.590 --> 06:02:15.600 align:start position:0%
causes
 
06:02:17.750 --> 06:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
you know from the uh 19
 
06:02:20.150 --> 06:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
up to up to age 19 have died in new
 
06:02:22.708 --> 06:02:22.718 align:start position:0%
hampshire because of covet
 
06:02:24.788 --> 06:02:24.798 align:start position:0%
and the answer to that is zero
 
06:02:26.948 --> 06:02:26.958 align:start position:0%
so why are we why are we forcing kids to
 
06:02:28.708 --> 06:02:28.718 align:start position:0%
wear masks
 
06:02:30.628 --> 06:02:30.638 align:start position:0%
you know and and and suffer through the
 
06:02:32.470 --> 06:02:32.480 align:start position:0%
day be sick through the day and be
 
06:02:34.150 --> 06:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
bullied in school
 
06:02:35.990 --> 06:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
and uh you know this is nonsense uh
 
06:02:36.000 --> 06:02:37.270 align:start position:0%
and uh you know this is nonsense uh
windham

i hate to say the state has to do
 
06:02:57.830 --> 06:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
something about it but they're
 
06:02:59.670 --> 06:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
overstepping their bounds there is no
 
06:02:59.680 --> 06:03:00.708 align:start position:0%
overstepping their bounds there is no
law

06:03:00.708 --> 06:03:00.718 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
06:04:06.708 --> 06:04:06.718 align:start position:0%
my question
 
06:04:08.390 --> 06:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh you mentioned that this is a
 
06:04:11.190 --> 06:04:11.200 align:start position:0%
contentious issue in derry
 
06:04:14.788 --> 06:04:14.798 align:start position:0%
absolutely so um
 
06:04:16.788 --> 06:04:16.798 align:start position:0%
would it be
 
06:04:19.270 --> 06:04:19.280 align:start position:0%
assumed then that the school is trying
 
06:04:21.910 --> 06:04:21.920 align:start position:0%
to deal with
 
06:04:24.390 --> 06:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
people who are very upset about the
 
06:04:26.708 --> 06:04:26.718 align:start position:0%
wearing of masks and people who are very
 
06:04:30.628 --> 06:04:30.638 align:start position:0%
upset about the not wearing of masks
 
06:04:33.030 --> 06:04:33.040 align:start position:0%
that would be correct but why is any one
 
06:04:35.110 --> 06:04:35.120 align:start position:0%
group's fear any any any more legitimate
 
06:04:37.830 --> 06:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:39.750 --> 06:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
i don't have an answer for you for that
 
06:04:39.760 --> 06:04:42.868 align:start position:0%
i don't have an answer for you for that
sir

06:04:42.868 --> 06:04:42.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:45.110 --> 06:04:45.120 align:start position:0%
woodcock thank you chairman
 
06:04:46.310 --> 06:04:46.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
 
06:04:48.230 --> 06:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
question um
 
06:04:49.510 --> 06:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
06:04:51.830 --> 06:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
the documents you gave us
 
06:04:54.070 --> 06:04:54.080 align:start position:0%
and the westbrook running
 
06:04:56.470 --> 06:04:56.480 align:start position:0%
brook middle school
 
06:04:58.548 --> 06:04:58.558 align:start position:0%
i guess the copy of an email
 
06:05:00.150 --> 06:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
where the front where the superintendent
 
06:05:02.150 --> 06:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
uh principal apparently said
 
06:05:04.310 --> 06:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
to be clear this time is designated for
 
06:05:06.708 --> 06:05:06.718 align:start position:0%
design for students who have chronically
 
06:05:08.708 --> 06:05:08.718 align:start position:0%
not responded to the encouragement
 
06:05:11.030 --> 06:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
prompts and support from staff
 
06:05:13.190 --> 06:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
is not intended for students whose mass
 
06:05:15.270 --> 06:05:15.280 align:start position:0%
happens to slip below their nose
 
06:05:17.270 --> 06:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
just 30 minutes on a friday afternoon
 
06:05:21.430 --> 06:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:23.910 --> 06:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
is it your thinking then that that
 
06:05:26.708 --> 06:05:26.718 align:start position:0%
sounds like bullying
 
06:05:27.910 --> 06:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
when children are getting sick and
 
06:05:29.510 --> 06:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
they're told they have to do it anyway
 
06:05:31.030 --> 06:05:31.040 align:start position:0%
yes it is bullying i'm just asking that
 
06:05:32.788 --> 06:05:32.798 align:start position:0%
comment that you made
 
06:05:35.430 --> 06:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
a testimony
 
06:05:37.670 --> 06:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
like i just said if if children are
 
06:05:39.270 --> 06:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
getting sick and he's going to have them
 
06:05:42.150 --> 06:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
stay after school yes that's bullying
 
06:05:44.548 --> 06:05:44.558 align:start position:0%
okay follow-up yes well that's only one
 
06:05:47.510 --> 06:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
second question if the school has rules
 
06:05:49.270 --> 06:05:49.280 align:start position:0%
where they happen to be
 
06:05:52.548 --> 06:05:52.558 align:start position:0%
and the teachers are required to enforce
 
06:05:54.230 --> 06:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
the rules are promulgated by the school
 
06:05:54.240 --> 06:05:55.110 align:start position:0%
the rules are promulgated by the school
board

06:05:55.110 --> 06:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
board
 
06:05:58.470 --> 06:05:58.480 align:start position:0%
um do you feel that that's their job
 
06:06:00.150 --> 06:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
the teachers do have to answer to the
 
06:06:01.670 --> 06:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
school board but so maybe the school
 
06:06:03.030 --> 06:06:03.040 align:start position:0%
board needs to be told what what they
 
06:06:06.310 --> 06:06:06.320 align:start position:0%
have to do because um they're
 
06:06:09.350 --> 06:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
they're going on on uh medical
 
06:06:12.390 --> 06:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
medical uh it doesn't exist okay i'm not
 
06:06:14.230 --> 06:06:14.240 align:start position:0%
questioning the validity of the policy
 
06:06:15.830 --> 06:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
i'm questioning your statement that the
 
06:06:17.430 --> 06:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
teachers were bullying for following the
 
06:06:18.868 --> 06:06:18.878 align:start position:0%
rules that's what you said they were
 
06:06:20.948 --> 06:06:20.958 align:start position:0%
bullying for following the rules of what
 
06:06:22.628 --> 06:06:22.638 align:start position:0%
they do all i'm asking you if the school
 
06:06:24.788 --> 06:06:24.798 align:start position:0%
has rules are the teachers supposed to
 
06:06:26.948 --> 06:06:26.958 align:start position:0%
follow them or not
 
06:06:29.110 --> 06:06:29.120 align:start position:0%
a teacher is not supposed to not
 
06:06:31.270 --> 06:06:31.280 align:start position:0%
supposed to bully make fun of uh you
 
06:06:32.788 --> 06:06:32.798 align:start position:0%
know and and that's what that according
 
06:06:34.390 --> 06:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
to that student that called me that's
 
06:06:35.750 --> 06:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
what they're doing did you find that on
 
06:06:38.230 --> 06:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
facebook as well or no i got a telephone
 
06:06:40.708 --> 06:06:40.718 align:start position:0%
call from that
 
06:06:44.150 --> 06:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:48.628 --> 06:06:48.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:16.948 --> 06:07:16.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:22.070 --> 06:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:30.868 --> 06:07:30.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:32.628 --> 06:07:32.638 align:start position:0%
is it is there a puddle or something
 
06:07:35.670 --> 06:07:35.680 align:start position:0%

06:08:08.628 --> 06:08:08.638 align:start position:0%
may 20th until the 91a rules were put
 
06:08:12.628 --> 06:08:12.638 align:start position:0%
back in place i believe june 1st or 2nd
 
06:08:14.948 --> 06:08:14.958 align:start position:0%
one of the things that you know that i'm
 
06:08:16.548 --> 06:08:16.558 align:start position:0%
having trouble with you know i totally
 
06:08:18.708 --> 06:08:18.718 align:start position:0%
agree there's there are there are a few
 
06:08:20.788 --> 06:08:20.798 align:start position:0%
different studies that uh the cdc has
 
06:08:22.628 --> 06:08:22.638 align:start position:0%
put up in pre-release until they were
 
06:08:24.070 --> 06:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
taken down
 
06:08:25.910 --> 06:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
relative to clusters and counties in
 
06:08:27.510 --> 06:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
arizona they really made no sense the
 
06:08:29.350 --> 06:08:29.360 align:start position:0%
authors admitted they were crude and
 
06:08:31.270 --> 06:08:31.280 align:start position:0%
they never were actually released but
 
06:08:34.070 --> 06:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
there's about 167 studies that show from
 
06:08:36.470 --> 06:08:36.480 align:start position:0%
the brownstone um institute that show
 
06:08:38.150 --> 06:08:38.160 align:start position:0%
that they don't work
 
06:08:39.830 --> 06:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
you can debate that all you want none
 
06:08:42.548 --> 06:08:42.558 align:start position:0%
versus 167 you know certainly there's
 
06:08:44.708 --> 06:08:44.718 align:start position:0%
different variations of expertise that
 
06:08:47.350 --> 06:08:47.360 align:start position:0%
people need to to look at my concern
 
06:08:49.350 --> 06:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
really has to do with the um the
 
06:08:51.750 --> 06:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
inability for our elected officials
 
06:08:52.868 --> 06:08:52.878 align:start position:0%
within the school
 
06:08:52.878 --> 06:08:53.750 align:start position:0%
within the school
board

06:08:53.750 --> 06:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
board
 
06:08:55.990 --> 06:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
as well as the you know appointed uh
 
06:08:58.070 --> 06:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
bureaucratic uh
 
06:08:58.080 --> 06:08:58.868 align:start position:0%
bureaucratic uh
uh

06:08:58.868 --> 06:08:58.878 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:09:00.868 --> 06:09:00.878 align:start position:0%
appointed people like dr chan for
 
06:09:00.878 --> 06:09:01.830 align:start position:0%
appointed people like dr chan for
instance

06:09:01.830 --> 06:09:01.840 align:start position:0%
instance
 
06:09:03.110 --> 06:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
who has some things that have been
 
06:09:05.990 --> 06:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
contrary to um even statements made by
 
06:09:08.548 --> 06:09:08.558 align:start position:0%
the cdc such as that you know without
 
06:09:10.150 --> 06:09:10.160 align:start position:0%
mask we're gonna have major problems
 
06:09:13.030 --> 06:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
with spread even after the barnstable um
 
06:09:15.510 --> 06:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
study that was done in july where the
 
06:09:17.750 --> 06:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
cdc came out and said you know look you
 
06:09:20.390 --> 06:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
know these these uh we have spread it
 
06:09:22.310 --> 06:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
it's gonna be equal no matter what you
 
06:09:24.390 --> 06:09:24.400 align:start position:0%
do with vaccines so there's there's a
 
06:09:25.910 --> 06:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
lot of information that's coming out
 
06:09:28.070 --> 06:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
from experts that are in positions of
 
06:09:29.750 --> 06:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
authority who are meeting with
 
06:09:32.070 --> 06:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
superintendents um and they're telling
 
06:09:33.430 --> 06:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
them one thing but they can't really
 
06:09:35.030 --> 06:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
back it up and i can the only thing that
 
06:09:36.470 --> 06:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
i can say is that from a parent's
 
06:09:39.190 --> 06:09:39.200 align:start position:0%
standpoint when we're being told that we
 
06:09:41.030 --> 06:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
have research and studies that show that
 
06:09:43.190 --> 06:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
mass work to prevent the spread of
 
06:09:46.548 --> 06:09:46.558 align:start position:0%
covert 19 and you ask them okay can you
 
06:09:48.390 --> 06:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
please provide me with that research can
 
06:09:50.310 --> 06:09:50.320 align:start position:0%
you show me what due diligence that you
 
06:09:53.910 --> 06:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
performed to make it okay whereby like
 
06:09:56.150 --> 06:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
in something as simple as article two in
 
06:09:57.910 --> 06:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
our bill of rights in new hampshire you
 
06:09:58.948 --> 06:09:58.958 align:start position:0%
know that says we have the right to
 
06:10:00.470 --> 06:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
protect our property and pursue
 
06:10:02.628 --> 06:10:02.638 align:start position:0%
happiness how can you violate that and
 
06:10:04.070 --> 06:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
they turn around i said well you know
 
06:10:06.948 --> 06:10:06.958 align:start position:0%
new hampshire dhhs actually has that
 
06:10:09.190 --> 06:10:09.200 align:start position:0%
research you'll have to ask them so i'm
 
06:10:11.430 --> 06:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
not shy when it comes to communicating
 
06:10:12.788 --> 06:10:12.798 align:start position:0%
and calling
 
06:10:14.708 --> 06:10:14.718 align:start position:0%
people in government i called his office
 
06:10:16.628 --> 06:10:16.638 align:start position:0%
several times was never able to make
 
06:10:18.948 --> 06:10:18.958 align:start position:0%
contact and i wrote an email and i asked
 
06:10:21.030 --> 06:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
these very questions i've been told that
 
06:10:23.270 --> 06:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
you guys have the research and i get no
 
06:10:25.910 --> 06:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
response but i am told through
 
06:10:28.390 --> 06:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
you know my in my own discovery is that
 
06:10:30.628 --> 06:10:30.638 align:start position:0%
they're really relying on the cdc who
 
06:10:32.628 --> 06:10:32.638 align:start position:0%
post these pima county and maricopa
 
06:10:35.270 --> 06:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
county studies on clusters where you've
 
06:10:36.070 --> 06:10:36.080 align:start position:0%
got a
 
06:10:38.150 --> 06:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
county that has clusters that are 75
 
06:10:39.670 --> 06:10:39.680 align:start position:0%
percent of the population in the entire
 
06:10:41.350 --> 06:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
state of arizona and they're being
 
06:10:43.430 --> 06:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
equally compared to a county that has
 
06:10:45.750 --> 06:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
maybe uh five percent of the population
 
06:10:48.230 --> 06:10:48.240 align:start position:0%
now these things don't make any sense um
 
06:10:51.510 --> 06:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
so my issue uh my support of this bill
 
06:10:53.350 --> 06:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
really comes from the fact that i still
 
06:10:55.270 --> 06:10:55.280 align:start position:0%
have yet to be provided from an elected
 
06:10:57.670 --> 06:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
official within my district from a
 
06:10:59.910 --> 06:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
superintendent from you know anyone at
 
06:11:02.070 --> 06:11:02.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire dhhs which shows me that
 
06:11:03.590 --> 06:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
these things actually stop the spread
 
06:11:05.750 --> 06:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
the latest and greatest from cdc is they
 
06:11:07.750 --> 06:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
put out a new study that says you know
 
06:11:09.590 --> 06:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
cloth cloth masks are pretty much
 
06:11:12.150 --> 06:11:12.160 align:start position:0%
useless or the least effective they say
 
06:11:13.830 --> 06:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
and then they go into the
 
06:11:16.470 --> 06:11:16.480 align:start position:0%
improperly worn surgical mass which as
 
06:11:17.830 --> 06:11:17.840 align:start position:0%
we know you know from the side and the
 
06:11:19.990 --> 06:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
space between the nose that's about nine
 
06:11:21.590 --> 06:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
miles of distance compared to a ping
 
06:11:23.830 --> 06:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
pong ball you know when you talk about
 
06:11:25.750 --> 06:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
airborne particulates
 
06:11:27.510 --> 06:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
you can go out and you can look at um
 
06:11:29.430 --> 06:11:29.440 align:start position:0%
you know osha has has a lot of
 
06:11:29.440 --> 06:11:30.390 align:start position:0%
you know osha has has a lot of
information

06:11:30.390 --> 06:11:30.400 align:start position:0%
information
 
06:11:31.910 --> 06:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
there's plenty of industrial hygienists
 
06:11:33.750 --> 06:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
that have unbelievable information or
 
06:11:36.788 --> 06:11:36.798 align:start position:0%
references to studies the epa has plenty
 
06:11:38.070 --> 06:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
of information out there you're never
 
06:11:39.510 --> 06:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
going to find something where you can
 
06:11:41.430 --> 06:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
prove that these mass work unless you're
 
06:11:43.430 --> 06:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
talking about a respirator meaning an
 
06:11:43.440 --> 06:11:44.390 align:start position:0%
talking about a respirator meaning an
n95

06:11:44.390 --> 06:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
n95
 
06:11:46.230 --> 06:11:46.240 align:start position:0%
that has a filtration device on it and
 
06:11:48.230 --> 06:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
that's if you can keep it clean because
 
06:11:49.750 --> 06:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
if you can't keep it clean it's really
 
06:11:51.830 --> 06:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
doing nothing so i think if we're going
 
06:11:54.548 --> 06:11:54.558 align:start position:0%
to exchange our right you know to
 
06:11:56.390 --> 06:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
have the ability to be
 
06:11:59.350 --> 06:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
animal costumes in uh you know chokers
 
06:12:00.868 --> 06:12:00.878 align:start position:0%
around their necks with leashes hanging
 
06:12:03.350 --> 06:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
off but we can't let them smile
 
06:12:05.590 --> 06:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
i think it's really difficult for me to
 
06:12:07.270 --> 06:12:07.280 align:start position:0%
accept the fact that no
 
06:12:07.280 --> 06:12:08.310 align:start position:0%
accept the fact that no
expert

06:12:08.310 --> 06:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
expert
 
06:12:09.830 --> 06:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
can tell me why they're doing this and
 
06:12:11.670 --> 06:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
when you when we have an environment
 
06:12:14.230 --> 06:12:14.240 align:start position:0%
like hey governor says we have local
 
06:12:16.788 --> 06:12:16.798 align:start position:0%
control when the local control says hey
 
06:12:18.470 --> 06:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
we're only following the recommendations
 
06:12:20.628 --> 06:12:20.638 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire dhhs
 
06:12:23.510 --> 06:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire dhs hs can say not us
 
06:12:25.510 --> 06:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
it's just a recommendation really the
 
06:12:27.510 --> 06:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
parent is left in the middle everyone's
 
06:12:29.110 --> 06:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
punting back and forth and we're the
 
06:12:31.110 --> 06:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
monkey and i think it's a time it's time
 
06:12:32.788 --> 06:12:32.798 align:start position:0%
for this to stop i think it's time for
 
06:12:34.310 --> 06:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
us to really just
 
06:12:36.150 --> 06:12:36.160 align:start position:0%
knock off the nonsense let these kids
 
06:12:37.910 --> 06:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
smile let them breathe if you don't
 
06:12:39.430 --> 06:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
think there's a restriction breathing
 
06:12:40.628 --> 06:12:40.638 align:start position:0%
why are you wearing it because you're
 
06:12:42.150 --> 06:12:42.160 align:start position:0%
not preventing anything from coming in
 
06:12:43.350 --> 06:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
your lungs
 
06:12:44.868 --> 06:12:44.878 align:start position:0%
in theory so
 
06:12:46.948 --> 06:12:46.958 align:start position:0%
i i don't really know what else to say
 
06:12:48.548 --> 06:12:48.558 align:start position:0%
other than we should be making it as
 
06:12:51.590 --> 06:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
hard as possible to um you know allow
 
06:12:53.910 --> 06:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
school districts to put these things on
 
06:12:55.990 --> 06:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
require these things on the children's
 
06:12:58.230 --> 06:12:58.240 align:start position:0%
faces in my opinion we should stop the
 
06:13:01.190 --> 06:13:01.200 align:start position:0%
noble lying and you know be on with it
 
06:13:04.070 --> 06:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
and move on you know that's that's it
 
06:13:06.150 --> 06:13:06.160 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions
 
06:13:07.510 --> 06:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions from
 
06:13:08.390 --> 06:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
06:13:12.390 --> 06:13:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:13.990 --> 06:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
sir have you googled this to find the
 
06:13:14.000 --> 06:13:15.270 align:start position:0%
sir have you googled this to find the
studies

06:13:15.270 --> 06:13:15.280 align:start position:0%
studies
 
06:13:17.830 --> 06:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
oh yes yes i uh i don't use google but
 
06:13:20.230 --> 06:13:20.240 align:start position:0%
yes i have i've read the studies i just
 
06:13:21.830 --> 06:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
googled it and the one of the very first
 
06:13:23.590 --> 06:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
things that came up would you believe is
 
06:13:26.628 --> 06:13:26.638 align:start position:0%
a study from stamford dated september
 
06:13:26.638 --> 06:13:27.510 align:start position:0%
a study from stamford dated september
1st

06:13:27.510 --> 06:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
1st
 
06:13:30.628 --> 06:13:30.638 align:start position:0%
that is peer-reviewed randomized study
 
06:13:33.430 --> 06:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
on the use of masks with it's jointly
 
06:13:36.310 --> 06:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
with stamford and yale medical schools
 
06:13:38.310 --> 06:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
and law school and uh yeah both medical
 
06:13:39.990 --> 06:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
schools um
 
06:13:41.830 --> 06:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
with the randomized study with hundreds
 
06:13:44.390 --> 06:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
of of people showing in in multiple
 
06:13:46.548 --> 06:13:46.558 align:start position:0%
sites showing how the use of surgical
 
06:13:48.948 --> 06:13:48.958 align:start position:0%
masks and other masks have helped limit
 
06:13:51.110 --> 06:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
the transmission of covet the studies
 
06:13:53.270 --> 06:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
are out there i believe and that's why i
 
06:13:55.030 --> 06:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
asked if you google it would you believe
 
06:13:57.270 --> 06:13:57.280 align:start position:0%
it i had no trouble finding a study just
 
06:13:58.628 --> 06:13:58.638 align:start position:0%
sitting here while you were chatting
 
06:13:58.638 --> 06:13:59.430 align:start position:0%
sitting here while you were chatting
that

06:13:59.430 --> 06:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:14:00.948 --> 06:14:00.958 align:start position:0%
a professional study from some of the
 
06:14:02.948 --> 06:14:02.958 align:start position:0%
top universities in the country that
 
06:14:04.948 --> 06:14:04.958 align:start position:0%
immediately as i say one of the first
 
06:14:06.948 --> 06:14:06.958 align:start position:0%
things that came up prove that it does
 
06:14:08.628 --> 06:14:08.638 align:start position:0%
prevent transmission
 
06:14:11.350 --> 06:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
i i would venture to say that uh using a
 
06:14:13.110 --> 06:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
strong word like prove
 
06:14:15.750 --> 06:14:15.760 align:start position:0%
it would be um inaccurate but i would
 
06:14:17.670 --> 06:14:17.680 align:start position:0%
say that i don't google because you're
 
06:14:19.350 --> 06:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
normally going to find
 
06:14:21.830 --> 06:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
things that support masking up top
 
06:14:23.510 --> 06:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
i tried maybe brave or i tried
 
06:14:26.628 --> 06:14:26.638 align:start position:0%
duckduckgo where you're going to find a
 
06:14:29.750 --> 06:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
more of a bigger population of studies
 
06:14:31.510 --> 06:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
that come from universities as well like
 
06:14:33.430 --> 06:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
brown or stanford
 
06:14:35.190 --> 06:14:35.200 align:start position:0%
and i think that's that's probably fair
 
06:14:36.868 --> 06:14:36.878 align:start position:0%
i haven't read the study that you're
 
06:14:38.708 --> 06:14:38.718 align:start position:0%
talking about but i will say that you
 
06:14:41.510 --> 06:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
know i've seen significant bias in
 
06:14:43.830 --> 06:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
google and you can certainly look at dr
 
06:14:46.310 --> 06:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
robert epstein's studies on google so
 
06:14:47.750 --> 06:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
that you can get a better context of
 
06:14:49.110 --> 06:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
what they're doing with their search
 
06:14:50.788 --> 06:14:50.798 align:start position:0%
results you might want to try google
 
06:14:52.708 --> 06:14:52.718 align:start position:0%
scholar that might be more to your
 
06:14:52.718 --> 06:14:57.110 align:start position:0%
scholar that might be more to your
liking

06:14:57.110 --> 06:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:59.350 --> 06:14:59.360 align:start position:0%

scott taking my question um i know at
 
06:15:07.190 --> 06:15:07.200 align:start position:0%
the last speaker we seem to get off
 
06:15:07.200 --> 06:15:08.310 align:start position:0%
the last speaker we seem to get off
track

06:15:08.310 --> 06:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
track
 
06:15:08.320 --> 06:15:09.350 align:start position:0%
track
um

06:15:09.350 --> 06:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:15:11.110 --> 06:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
more more for the jogging than the
 
06:15:12.548 --> 06:15:12.558 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill
 
06:15:12.558 --> 06:15:20.708 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill
certainly

06:15:20.708 --> 06:15:20.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:22.628 --> 06:15:22.638 align:start position:0%
uh but beyond that back to the bill but
 
06:15:24.548 --> 06:15:24.558 align:start position:0%
the bill the bill really doesn't handle
 
06:15:24.558 --> 06:15:25.270 align:start position:0%
the bill the bill really doesn't handle
the

06:15:25.270 --> 06:15:25.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:15:26.948 --> 06:15:26.958 align:start position:0%
your concern of the school board's
 
06:15:28.868 --> 06:15:28.878 align:start position:0%
policy i know it's kind of tough the
 
06:15:31.590 --> 06:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
school board's policy of masking any
 
06:15:33.190 --> 06:15:33.200 align:start position:0%
particular you may be talking himalayan
 
06:15:34.868 --> 06:15:34.878 align:start position:0%
regional or whatever the district
 
06:15:36.548 --> 06:15:36.558 align:start position:0%
happens to be that's not what the bill
 
06:15:37.910 --> 06:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
says the bills
 
06:15:40.150 --> 06:15:40.160 align:start position:0%
it does in general but the specifics of
 
06:15:43.750 --> 06:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
the bill talks about if in fact a school
 
06:15:46.150 --> 06:15:46.160 align:start position:0%
has a policy of masking
 
06:15:47.830 --> 06:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
and you do not want your child to
 
06:15:49.590 --> 06:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
participate in the policy of masking or
 
06:15:51.510 --> 06:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
the parent choice then you would be
 
06:15:53.190 --> 06:15:53.200 align:start position:0%
allowed to take your child out of that
 
06:15:55.110 --> 06:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
school and place them in any public
 
06:15:57.350 --> 06:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
private school uh and
 
06:15:58.868 --> 06:15:58.878 align:start position:0%
it says didn't say in the state but for
 
06:16:00.788 --> 06:16:00.798 align:start position:0%
sure it's in the state um at the cost
 
06:16:02.628 --> 06:16:02.638 align:start position:0%
and transportation of the school because
 
06:16:04.150 --> 06:16:04.160 align:start position:0%
for example you could take your
 
06:16:06.150 --> 06:16:06.160 align:start position:0%
youngster out of your home school if you
 
06:16:07.830 --> 06:16:07.840 align:start position:0%
didn't agree with the policy and send
 
06:16:10.230 --> 06:16:10.240 align:start position:0%
him to say a proctor or brewster or
 
06:16:12.310 --> 06:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
oprah academy or to a private school or
 
06:16:12.320 --> 06:16:13.510 align:start position:0%
oprah academy or to a private school or
to

06:16:13.510 --> 06:16:13.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:16:15.190 --> 06:16:15.200 align:start position:0%
you know another public school
 
06:16:16.230 --> 06:16:16.240 align:start position:0%
down the road from where you have to
 
06:16:17.910 --> 06:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
live sure so that's the essence of the
 
06:16:20.708 --> 06:16:20.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:22.948 --> 06:16:22.958 align:start position:0%
your concern about the policy is
 
06:16:24.548 --> 06:16:24.558 align:start position:0%
justified to the local school board
 
06:16:25.910 --> 06:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
doing things you don't particularly care
 
06:16:28.708 --> 06:16:28.718 align:start position:0%
for and how you remedy that um but the
 
06:16:30.948 --> 06:16:30.958 align:start position:0%
bill talks about just moving a youngster
 
06:16:32.788 --> 06:16:32.798 align:start position:0%
from one school to another
 
06:16:33.830 --> 06:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
whether it be accepted by another
 
06:16:35.510 --> 06:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
district or private school now do you
 
06:16:39.190 --> 06:16:39.200 align:start position:0%
think that that that policy is sound
 
06:16:40.948 --> 06:16:40.958 align:start position:0%
uh to answer your question i think it is
 
06:16:42.390 --> 06:16:42.400 align:start position:0%
i think if you go back to article two
 
06:16:44.230 --> 06:16:44.240 align:start position:0%
and you talk about the equality of
 
06:16:46.150 --> 06:16:46.160 align:start position:0%
rights and if you have a school board
 
06:16:48.470 --> 06:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
that is preventing you know your right
 
06:16:50.788 --> 06:16:50.798 align:start position:0%
to uh express yourself through smile or
 
06:16:52.948 --> 06:16:52.958 align:start position:0%
breathing or maybe even access to an
 
06:16:54.868 --> 06:16:54.878 align:start position:0%
education however we want to define
 
06:16:57.270 --> 06:16:57.280 align:start position:0%
rates it fits um i would say 100 percent
 
06:16:59.350 --> 06:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
that you know not only do as you said i
 
06:17:01.510 --> 06:17:01.520 align:start position:0%
started out by saying i think that this
 
06:17:04.150 --> 06:17:04.160 align:start position:0%
um this this is a difficult thing for
 
06:17:06.390 --> 06:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
parents to accept without due process
 
06:17:08.310 --> 06:17:08.320 align:start position:0%
but i i also agree that the incentives
 
06:17:09.910 --> 06:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
that are in this bill
 
06:17:13.110 --> 06:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
make it possible to uh provide an equal
 
06:17:17.110 --> 06:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
access to not having to wear a mask
 
06:17:18.708 --> 06:17:18.718 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason you see fit
 
06:17:20.310 --> 06:17:20.320 align:start position:0%
including you know your access to an
 
06:17:22.868 --> 06:17:22.878 align:start position:0%
education so yes i do i think thank you
 
06:17:24.070 --> 06:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:17:26.948 --> 06:17:26.958 align:start position:0%

cordelia
 
06:17:29.670 --> 06:17:29.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
06:17:32.788 --> 06:17:32.798 align:start position:0%
being here i was just wondering if
 
06:17:34.628 --> 06:17:34.638 align:start position:0%
your school in atkinson
 
06:17:37.830 --> 06:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
has mandatory mass policy and if they uh
 
06:17:39.190 --> 06:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
provide for
 
06:17:42.070 --> 06:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
exemptions for instance medical
 
06:17:45.350 --> 06:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
exemptions or even exemptions for
 
06:17:49.350 --> 06:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
students with an iep or 504 plan
 
06:17:52.708 --> 06:17:52.718 align:start position:0%
um i i i can't speak to that um i can
 
06:17:55.270 --> 06:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
say that i'm aware that they
 
06:17:57.190 --> 06:17:57.200 align:start position:0%
they re-implemented that
 
06:17:59.110 --> 06:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
for this school year they didn't last
 
06:18:00.868 --> 06:18:00.878 align:start position:0%
year which i think they admit was a
 
06:18:03.190 --> 06:18:03.200 align:start position:0%
mistake the only thing i can tell you is
 
06:18:06.150 --> 06:18:06.160 align:start position:0%
that i have friends that have kids who
 
06:18:08.470 --> 06:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
that is not always being honored um even
 
06:18:10.070 --> 06:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
doctors notes are not always being
 
06:18:12.788 --> 06:18:12.798 align:start position:0%
honored unless they fit certain
 
06:18:14.470 --> 06:18:14.480 align:start position:0%
you know definitions of disability with
 
06:18:16.070 --> 06:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
respect to services being brought on by
 
06:18:17.430 --> 06:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
the school
 
06:18:19.510 --> 06:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
but i'm not an expert so i apologize i
 
06:18:21.590 --> 06:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
can't really give
 
06:18:24.708 --> 06:18:24.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:27.910 --> 06:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:29.430 --> 06:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i really appreciate
 
06:18:36.470 --> 06:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:09.350 --> 06:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:11.430 --> 06:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
see i have this on and you can hear me
 
06:19:13.350 --> 06:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
thank you good afternoon chairman lad
 
06:19:15.270 --> 06:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee
 
06:19:16.868 --> 06:19:16.878 align:start position:0%
deborah howes here from the american
 
06:19:19.350 --> 06:19:19.360 align:start position:0%
federation of teachers new hampshire and
 
06:19:21.270 --> 06:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
i appreciate this chance to address the
 
06:19:24.390 --> 06:19:24.400 align:start position:0%
committee on hb 1588
 
06:19:27.670 --> 06:19:27.680 align:start position:0%
i'm here to oppose this and
 
06:19:29.670 --> 06:19:29.680 align:start position:0%
the main issue is
 
06:19:29.680 --> 06:19:31.190 align:start position:0%
the main issue is
because

06:19:31.190 --> 06:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
because
 
06:19:33.430 --> 06:19:33.440 align:start position:0%
it is a matter of local control
 
06:19:35.270 --> 06:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
we strongly feel that this would be the
 
06:19:36.548 --> 06:19:36.558 align:start position:0%
state getting in the middle of a
 
06:19:38.788 --> 06:19:38.798 align:start position:0%
decision that is really best left up to
 
06:19:41.590 --> 06:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
a school districts local school boards
 
06:19:43.830 --> 06:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
to all the parents and the voters in the
 
06:19:43.840 --> 06:19:46.230 align:start position:0%
to all the parents and the voters in the
district

06:19:46.230 --> 06:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
district
 
06:19:47.750 --> 06:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
well this bill is written to give
 
06:19:49.270 --> 06:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
individual parents the right to object
 
06:19:50.628 --> 06:19:50.638 align:start position:0%
to having a student
 
06:19:52.468 --> 06:19:52.478 align:start position:0%
wear a mask in school it has deeper
 
06:19:54.788 --> 06:19:54.798 align:start position:0%
consequences because removing those
 
06:19:57.430 --> 06:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
students to other educational options
 
06:19:59.030 --> 06:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
which is the remedy suggested in this
 
06:19:59.040 --> 06:20:00.070 align:start position:0%
which is the remedy suggested in this
bill

06:20:00.070 --> 06:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:20:04.468 --> 06:20:04.478 align:start position:0%
has a huge could have a huge cost
 
06:20:06.868 --> 06:20:06.878 align:start position:0%
to the district and that has an impact
 
06:20:09.510 --> 06:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
on the education that is offered to all
 
06:20:11.110 --> 06:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
the rest of the students
 
06:20:12.948 --> 06:20:12.958 align:start position:0%
that are in those public schools to all
 
06:20:14.628 --> 06:20:14.638 align:start position:0%
their families who choose those public
 
06:20:16.230 --> 06:20:16.240 align:start position:0%
schools and support them and to the
 
06:20:17.830 --> 06:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
local voters and local property
 
06:20:17.840 --> 06:20:19.350 align:start position:0%
local voters and local property
taxpayers

06:20:19.350 --> 06:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
06:20:20.948 --> 06:20:20.958 align:start position:0%
i wish with all my heart that we weren't
 
06:20:23.030 --> 06:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
still in this place in the pandemic
 
06:20:24.628 --> 06:20:24.638 align:start position:0%
where we're having to talk about masks
 
06:20:26.868 --> 06:20:26.878 align:start position:0%
and other mitigation measures so that we
 
06:20:28.948 --> 06:20:28.958 align:start position:0%
can keep schools open
 
06:20:30.390 --> 06:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
i would really like and all my
 
06:20:31.670 --> 06:20:31.680 align:start position:0%
colleagues would really like to be able
 
06:20:33.510 --> 06:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
to teach and see our students face to
 
06:20:35.750 --> 06:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
face and see their whole face not just
 
06:20:37.030 --> 06:20:37.040 align:start position:0%
this part of it
 
06:20:39.190 --> 06:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
but we need to do what we can
 
06:20:41.350 --> 06:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
so that we can keep schools open and in
 
06:20:41.360 --> 06:20:42.310 align:start position:0%
so that we can keep schools open and in
person

06:20:42.310 --> 06:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
person
 
06:20:43.910 --> 06:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
and i understand how strongly people
 
06:20:46.230 --> 06:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
feel on both sides of the mask issue
 
06:20:48.788 --> 06:20:48.798 align:start position:0%
but having the state step in like this
 
06:20:50.628 --> 06:20:50.638 align:start position:0%
will not make it any better
 
06:20:52.150 --> 06:20:52.160 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has long tradition of
 
06:20:53.430 --> 06:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
local control
 
06:20:55.270 --> 06:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
and local democracy that gives parents
 
06:20:57.270 --> 06:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
and educators a voice in schools and
 
06:20:58.868 --> 06:20:58.878 align:start position:0%
communities through their local school
 
06:21:01.110 --> 06:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
board this bill inserts the state into
 
06:21:02.868 --> 06:21:02.878 align:start position:0%
safety decisions that should be left to
 
06:21:04.390 --> 06:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
families and communities to work out
 
06:21:06.868 --> 06:21:06.878 align:start position:0%
with their elected school boards
 
06:21:08.548 --> 06:21:08.558 align:start position:0%
and as i was saying before the budgetary
 
06:21:10.868 --> 06:21:10.878 align:start position:0%
impact on a district could be huge
 
06:21:13.590 --> 06:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
because the remedy suggested is that a
 
06:21:15.350 --> 06:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
parent who objected
 
06:21:18.868 --> 06:21:18.878 align:start position:0%
to a locally adopted mask mandate
 
06:21:20.948 --> 06:21:20.958 align:start position:0%
could send their student
 
06:21:23.430 --> 06:21:23.440 align:start position:0%
to any other school public or non-public
 
06:21:25.430 --> 06:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
or any program that was approved under
 
06:21:25.440 --> 06:21:26.230 align:start position:0%
or any program that was approved under
the

06:21:26.230 --> 06:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:21:28.788 --> 06:21:28.798 align:start position:0%
existing state voucher program
 
06:21:30.548 --> 06:21:30.558 align:start position:0%
that could be a small cost that could be
 
06:21:32.628 --> 06:21:32.638 align:start position:0%
a large cost depending upon what the
 
06:21:34.868 --> 06:21:34.878 align:start position:0%
program is what the school is how far
 
06:21:37.190 --> 06:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
away it is the transportation would also
 
06:21:39.510 --> 06:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
have to be borne by the
 
06:21:41.670 --> 06:21:41.680 align:start position:0%
sending district
 
06:21:44.070 --> 06:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
that could very quickly add up to
 
06:21:46.390 --> 06:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
needing to cut your budget
 
06:21:46.400 --> 06:21:47.270 align:start position:0%
needing to cut your budget
that

06:21:47.270 --> 06:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:21:49.990 --> 06:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
would very soon you know mean that
 
06:21:51.350 --> 06:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
you're looking at cutting classes you're
 
06:21:53.590 --> 06:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
looking at cutting staff
 
06:21:55.510 --> 06:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
that is not fair to all the other
 
06:21:57.590 --> 06:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
students all the other
 
06:21:59.670 --> 06:21:59.680 align:start position:0%
families that are depending on that
 
06:22:03.270 --> 06:22:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:04.628 --> 06:22:04.638 align:start position:0%
so if we're talking about balancing
 
06:22:04.638 --> 06:22:05.590 align:start position:0%
so if we're talking about balancing
rights

06:22:05.590 --> 06:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
rights
 
06:22:07.030 --> 06:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
you're balancing the rights of the
 
06:22:09.030 --> 06:22:09.040 align:start position:0%
individuals who object versus the rights
 
06:22:11.350 --> 06:22:11.360 align:start position:0%
of all the other students and families
 
06:22:13.750 --> 06:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
relying on that public school
 
06:22:15.830 --> 06:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
this new bill is an unfunded unlimited
 
06:22:17.430 --> 06:22:17.440 align:start position:0%
mandate on local school districts and
 
06:22:19.990 --> 06:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
property taxpayers
 
06:22:21.590 --> 06:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
why would we put this financial burden
 
06:22:23.110 --> 06:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
on our neighborhood public schools at a
 
06:22:25.030 --> 06:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
time like this schools and educators are
 
06:22:26.310 --> 06:22:26.320 align:start position:0%
doing their best to give students
 
06:22:28.948 --> 06:22:28.958 align:start position:0%
stability help hope
 
06:22:31.030 --> 06:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
during another challenging school year
 
06:22:33.110 --> 06:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
we need support from this legislator
 
06:22:33.120 --> 06:22:34.150 align:start position:0%
we need support from this legislator
slater

06:22:34.150 --> 06:22:34.160 align:start position:0%
slater
 
06:22:36.310 --> 06:22:36.320 align:start position:0%
this is not the time to drain even more
 
06:22:38.310 --> 06:22:38.320 align:start position:0%
funding and resources from our schools
 
06:22:40.150 --> 06:22:40.160 align:start position:0%
this is not the time to create marques
 
06:22:42.150 --> 06:22:42.160 align:start position:0%
it's time to be pulling together and
 
06:22:43.990 --> 06:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
doing what we can
 
06:22:45.670 --> 06:22:45.680 align:start position:0%
to make this
 
06:22:47.750 --> 06:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
a year of recovery for our students and
 
06:22:49.510 --> 06:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
to do what we can to help them all
 
06:22:51.110 --> 06:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
thrive and i thank you for your
 
06:22:51.120 --> 06:22:52.150 align:start position:0%
thrive and i thank you for your
attention

06:22:52.150 --> 06:22:52.160 align:start position:0%
attention
 
06:22:54.708 --> 06:22:54.718 align:start position:0%
and i do have written testimony though
 
06:22:57.030 --> 06:22:57.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there questions
 
06:22:58.390 --> 06:22:58.400 align:start position:0%
representative boom
 
06:22:58.400 --> 06:22:59.190 align:start position:0%
representative boom
yes

06:22:59.190 --> 06:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:23:01.670 --> 06:23:01.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman there are a lot of
 
06:23:03.670 --> 06:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
laws on the books that
 
06:23:05.350 --> 06:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
tell school districts what they can and
 
06:23:07.030 --> 06:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
what they cannot do
 
06:23:09.990 --> 06:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
so what would be the cost if all all the
 
06:23:12.788 --> 06:23:12.798 align:start position:0%
school boards have to do is follow the
 
06:23:19.750 --> 06:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:22.310 --> 06:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
the cost would be in having to send a
 
06:23:24.390 --> 06:23:24.400 align:start position:0%
student to any other
 
06:23:26.390 --> 06:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
school or educational program in the
 
06:23:28.310 --> 06:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
state and pay for the transportation and
 
06:23:30.310 --> 06:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
the tuition that would be the cost but
 
06:23:30.320 --> 06:23:31.350 align:start position:0%
the tuition that would be the cost but
wouldn't

06:23:31.350 --> 06:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
wouldn't
 
06:23:32.708 --> 06:23:32.718 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
06:23:35.430 --> 06:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
but wouldn't there be no cost if the
 
06:23:37.590 --> 06:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
school district just followed the law if
 
06:23:48.070 --> 06:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:50.390 --> 06:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
i believe i've already answered your
 
06:23:50.400 --> 06:23:52.070 align:start position:0%
i believe i've already answered your
question

06:23:52.070 --> 06:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:23:54.708 --> 06:23:54.718 align:start position:0%
in the only way that
 
06:23:56.310 --> 06:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
makes sense
 
06:23:56.320 --> 06:23:57.510 align:start position:0%
makes sense
that

06:23:57.510 --> 06:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:24:00.390 --> 06:24:00.400 align:start position:0%
transportation is not costless
 
06:24:03.110 --> 06:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
tuition is not costless so we could play
 
06:24:04.830 --> 06:24:04.840 align:start position:0%
a logic game if you'd like
 
06:24:09.830 --> 06:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:12.230 --> 06:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
for further further questions
 
06:24:14.310 --> 06:24:14.320 align:start position:0%
represent cordelia
 
06:24:15.670 --> 06:24:15.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
06:24:16.868 --> 06:24:16.878 align:start position:0%
being here
 
06:24:19.110 --> 06:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
i was just wondering if you might know
 
06:24:22.390 --> 06:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
from your discussions with your members
 
06:24:25.910 --> 06:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
in schools where they have mask mandates
 
06:24:25.920 --> 06:24:27.670 align:start position:0%
in schools where they have mask mandates
currently

06:24:27.670 --> 06:24:27.680 align:start position:0%
currently
 
06:24:30.070 --> 06:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
do schools provide for
 
06:24:31.750 --> 06:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
exemptions for instance medical
 
06:24:31.760 --> 06:24:32.948 align:start position:0%
exemptions for instance medical
exemptions

06:24:32.948 --> 06:24:32.958 align:start position:0%
exemptions
 
06:24:35.190 --> 06:24:35.200 align:start position:0%
or exemptions for children who have been
 
06:24:38.150 --> 06:24:38.160 align:start position:0%
vaccinated or who might have natural
 
06:24:40.468 --> 06:24:40.478 align:start position:0%
immunity from having
 
06:24:40.478 --> 06:24:41.430 align:start position:0%
immunity from having
already

06:24:41.430 --> 06:24:41.440 align:start position:0%
already
 
06:24:44.070 --> 06:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
survived covid
 
06:24:46.948 --> 06:24:46.958 align:start position:0%
i know that schools do have
 
06:24:49.030 --> 06:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
policies and they vary from district to
 
06:24:51.270 --> 06:24:51.280 align:start position:0%
district but there are policies for
 
06:24:54.070 --> 06:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
students with
 
06:24:54.080 --> 06:24:56.468 align:start position:0%
students with
medical

06:24:56.468 --> 06:24:56.478 align:start position:0%
medical
 
06:25:00.390 --> 06:25:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:02.868 --> 06:25:02.878 align:start position:0%
i do not know the third part of that
 
06:25:04.070 --> 06:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
about students who have already had
 
06:25:06.548 --> 06:25:06.558 align:start position:0%
covet so i cannot answer that one and
 
06:25:07.990 --> 06:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
the one in the middle i'm trying to
 
06:25:09.990 --> 06:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
recall um
 
06:25:12.150 --> 06:25:12.160 align:start position:0%
immunization that varies from district
 
06:25:13.510 --> 06:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
to district that is a school board
 
06:25:16.708 --> 06:25:16.718 align:start position:0%
policy um that i cannot encapsulate some
 
06:25:18.948 --> 06:25:18.958 align:start position:0%
do some don't
 
06:25:22.230 --> 06:25:22.240 align:start position:0%
thank you are there further questions
 
06:25:28.390 --> 06:25:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:47.350 --> 06:25:47.360 align:start position:0%

from
 
06:26:01.190 --> 06:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
maybe a slightly different perspective
 
06:26:03.110 --> 06:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
from some of the conversations that took
 
06:26:04.390 --> 06:26:04.400 align:start position:0%
place today
 
06:26:06.070 --> 06:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
i'm a former chairman of the windham
 
06:26:07.990 --> 06:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
school board and i've dealt with parents
 
06:26:10.948 --> 06:26:10.958 align:start position:0%
who are on both sides of many issues
 
06:26:13.110 --> 06:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
and it's difficult to
 
06:26:15.430 --> 06:26:15.440 align:start position:0%
make everybody happy at any given point
 
06:26:17.830 --> 06:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
in time
 
06:26:20.070 --> 06:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
i don't look at this as whether this is
 
06:26:20.080 --> 06:26:21.350 align:start position:0%
i don't look at this as whether this is
about

06:26:21.350 --> 06:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
about
 
06:26:27.190 --> 06:26:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:28.310 --> 06:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
i believe
 
06:26:29.590 --> 06:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
06:26:31.030 --> 06:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
you know some of the conversations was
 
06:26:32.150 --> 06:26:32.160 align:start position:0%
that this is
 
06:26:33.590 --> 06:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
this should be dealt with at the local
 
06:26:33.600 --> 06:26:34.948 align:start position:0%
this should be dealt with at the local
level

06:26:34.948 --> 06:26:34.958 align:start position:0%
level
 
06:26:37.190 --> 06:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
that this is a local control issue and
 
06:26:39.670 --> 06:26:39.680 align:start position:0%
that the school boards have been elected
 
06:26:42.070 --> 06:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
in order to represent the parents
 
06:26:43.670 --> 06:26:43.680 align:start position:0%
and so therefore the state shouldn't get
 
06:26:43.680 --> 06:26:45.030 align:start position:0%
and so therefore the state shouldn't get
involved

06:26:45.030 --> 06:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
involved
 
06:26:46.628 --> 06:26:46.638 align:start position:0%
but as was
 
06:26:49.270 --> 06:26:49.280 align:start position:0%
just brought up the state has made laws
 
06:26:51.110 --> 06:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
and the state has made rules that have
 
06:26:52.788 --> 06:26:52.798 align:start position:0%
empowered school boards to do certain
 
06:26:52.798 --> 06:26:53.750 align:start position:0%
empowered school boards to do certain
things

06:26:53.750 --> 06:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
things
 
06:26:55.270 --> 06:26:55.280 align:start position:0%
and if those laws and those rules are
 
06:26:57.110 --> 06:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
being violated if they're not being
 
06:26:59.750 --> 06:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
enacted and implemented according to the
 
06:27:01.510 --> 06:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
will of the people who elected the
 
06:27:02.788 --> 06:27:02.798 align:start position:0%
school boards
 
06:27:05.590 --> 06:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
who in turn hired a superintendent who's
 
06:27:06.868 --> 06:27:06.878 align:start position:0%
there to
 
06:27:09.750 --> 06:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
represent and implement an education for
 
06:27:12.708 --> 06:27:12.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:15.190 --> 06:27:15.200 align:start position:0%
the answer
 
06:27:17.590 --> 06:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
isn't always going to be
 
06:27:19.750 --> 06:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
addressed at the local level these
 
06:27:22.948 --> 06:27:22.958 align:start position:0%
people are elected for multi-year terms
 
06:27:24.548 --> 06:27:24.558 align:start position:0%
some of them are elected on false
 
06:27:26.230 --> 06:27:26.240 align:start position:0%
promises and then they're there for
 
06:27:27.990 --> 06:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
multiple years
 
06:27:30.548 --> 06:27:30.558 align:start position:0%
and it's difficult sometimes to get the
 
06:27:31.830 --> 06:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
school boards
 
06:27:33.670 --> 06:27:33.680 align:start position:0%
to listen to the parents
 
06:27:35.670 --> 06:27:35.680 align:start position:0%
it's very clear last summer
 
06:27:37.750 --> 06:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
that there was an uprising
 
06:27:39.910 --> 06:27:39.920 align:start position:0%
across the entire country because people
 
06:27:42.310 --> 06:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
were upset about crt
 
06:27:45.190 --> 06:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
they were upset about mass mandates
 
06:27:46.948 --> 06:27:46.958 align:start position:0%
no matter what side of the issue you're
 
06:27:46.958 --> 06:27:48.150 align:start position:0%
no matter what side of the issue you're
on

06:27:48.150 --> 06:27:48.160 align:start position:0%
on
 
06:27:50.070 --> 06:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
it's an outrage that our federal
 
06:27:52.070 --> 06:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
government turned around
 
06:27:54.868 --> 06:27:54.878 align:start position:0%
and weaponized our fbi and declared
 
06:27:57.030 --> 06:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
parents who are there on behalf of their
 
06:27:59.190 --> 06:27:59.200 align:start position:0%
children lobbying on behalf of their
 
06:27:59.200 --> 06:28:00.468 align:start position:0%
children lobbying on behalf of their
children

06:28:00.468 --> 06:28:00.478 align:start position:0%
children
 
06:28:02.708 --> 06:28:02.718 align:start position:0%
calling them domestic terrorists
 
06:28:04.788 --> 06:28:04.798 align:start position:0%
that's where we're at right now and
 
06:28:06.788 --> 06:28:06.798 align:start position:0%
that's unacceptable
 
06:28:08.788 --> 06:28:08.798 align:start position:0%
everybody says when the budget time
 
06:28:11.030 --> 06:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
comes up for our schools that it's all
 
06:28:13.190 --> 06:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
about the kids
 
06:28:15.830 --> 06:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
yet i hear people here today saying well
 
06:28:17.270 --> 06:28:17.280 align:start position:0%
this is going to cost our school
 
06:28:19.270 --> 06:28:19.280 align:start position:0%
districts if they have to pay for a kid
 
06:28:21.110 --> 06:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
to go to another school
 
06:28:23.910 --> 06:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
that might be better for them
 
06:28:28.548 --> 06:28:28.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:30.708 --> 06:28:30.718 align:start position:0%
who knows if you have kids who knows
 
06:28:35.750 --> 06:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:37.990 --> 06:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
the parents know what's best for their
 
06:28:41.350 --> 06:28:41.360 align:start position:0%
children it's not a one size fit all
 
06:28:43.670 --> 06:28:43.680 align:start position:0%
when i was the chairman and i served on
 
06:28:46.468 --> 06:28:46.478 align:start position:0%
the school board i recognized this
 
06:28:47.990 --> 06:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
i helped people
 
06:28:50.310 --> 06:28:50.320 align:start position:0%
just a few
 
06:28:52.788 --> 06:28:52.798 align:start position:0%
find alternative forms of education for
 
06:28:54.868 --> 06:28:54.878 align:start position:0%
their kids because ultimately these are
 
06:28:57.190 --> 06:28:57.200 align:start position:0%
the future leaders of our country
 
06:28:59.910 --> 06:28:59.920 align:start position:0%
all of them should be in an educational
 
06:28:59.920 --> 06:29:01.110 align:start position:0%
all of them should be in an educational
environment

06:29:01.110 --> 06:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
environment
 
06:29:03.430 --> 06:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
that best suits
 
06:29:05.590 --> 06:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
the child's needs so that they can
 
06:29:08.868 --> 06:29:08.878 align:start position:0%
realize their maximum potential
 
06:29:10.868 --> 06:29:10.878 align:start position:0%
this should not be a political issue
 
06:29:13.510 --> 06:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
this should not be about masks whether
 
06:29:17.830 --> 06:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
you should be forced to wear one or not
 
06:29:21.030 --> 06:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
parents should be allowed to decide for
 
06:29:25.830 --> 06:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:27.670 --> 06:29:27.680 align:start position:0%
and if a parent decides that they don't
 
06:29:30.150 --> 06:29:30.160 align:start position:0%
want their children wearing masks all
 
06:29:31.350 --> 06:29:31.360 align:start position:0%
day long
 
06:29:33.910 --> 06:29:33.920 align:start position:0%
recycling co2
 
06:29:36.150 --> 06:29:36.160 align:start position:0%
potentially harmful yes there are
 
06:29:38.070 --> 06:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
studies out there that say one thing and
 
06:29:42.868 --> 06:29:42.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:44.628 --> 06:29:44.638 align:start position:0%
the parents know what's best for their
 
06:29:47.030 --> 06:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
kids and basically what this bill does
 
06:29:50.150 --> 06:29:50.160 align:start position:0%
is it allows the parent to decide what's
 
06:29:52.230 --> 06:29:52.240 align:start position:0%
the best educational environment for
 
06:29:55.110 --> 06:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
their child
 
06:29:57.030 --> 06:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
and if their child comes home every day
 
06:30:00.070 --> 06:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
complaining to them and crying to them
 
06:30:02.468 --> 06:30:02.478 align:start position:0%
and not learning to their potential
 
06:30:05.030 --> 06:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
because they're bothered and distracted
 
06:30:06.868 --> 06:30:06.878 align:start position:0%
and they're having trouble being
 
06:30:09.830 --> 06:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
comfortable throughout the day
 
06:30:12.628 --> 06:30:12.638 align:start position:0%
needs to be done about that
 
06:30:13.990 --> 06:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
06:30:17.910 --> 06:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
empowers parents to advocate for their
 
06:30:17.920 --> 06:30:19.030 align:start position:0%
empowers parents to advocate for their
child

06:30:19.030 --> 06:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
child
 
06:30:22.150 --> 06:30:22.160 align:start position:0%
this bill puts puts teeth
 
06:30:24.310 --> 06:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
into the words of the parents who go
 
06:30:26.868 --> 06:30:26.878 align:start position:0%
before the school boards
 
06:30:29.350 --> 06:30:29.360 align:start position:0%
and talk to them about their concerns
 
06:30:31.510 --> 06:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
about their child wearing a mask in
 
06:30:34.708 --> 06:30:34.718 align:start position:0%
school because their child is not
 
06:30:37.190 --> 06:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
comfortable is not getting the education
 
06:30:38.628 --> 06:30:38.638 align:start position:0%
that they need
 
06:30:39.990 --> 06:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
06:30:42.628 --> 06:30:42.638 align:start position:0%
forces the school board to listen to
 
06:30:44.948 --> 06:30:44.958 align:start position:0%
those parents because if they don't
 
06:30:48.310 --> 06:30:48.320 align:start position:0%
those parents now have an alternative
 
06:30:50.150 --> 06:30:50.160 align:start position:0%
and the school districts will pay the
 
06:30:52.468 --> 06:30:52.478 align:start position:0%
price of that and they will probably
 
06:30:55.270 --> 06:30:55.280 align:start position:0%
lose half of their students
 
06:30:57.670 --> 06:30:57.680 align:start position:0%
nobody should be up here advocating to
 
06:30:59.910 --> 06:30:59.920 align:start position:0%
retain the authority of those school
 
06:31:02.948 --> 06:31:02.958 align:start position:0%
boards who violate their oath of office
 
06:31:04.628 --> 06:31:04.638 align:start position:0%
which is to
 
06:31:04.638 --> 06:31:05.590 align:start position:0%
which is to
be

06:31:05.590 --> 06:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
be
 
06:31:08.628 --> 06:31:08.638 align:start position:0%
the servants of the people article eight
 
06:31:10.548 --> 06:31:10.558 align:start position:0%
of our constitution
 
06:31:12.150 --> 06:31:12.160 align:start position:0%
says that they are
 
06:31:12.160 --> 06:31:12.948 align:start position:0%
says that they are
the

06:31:12.948 --> 06:31:12.958 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:31:14.468 --> 06:31:14.478 align:start position:0%
they are the
 
06:31:17.510 --> 06:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
magistrates and servants
 
06:31:20.070 --> 06:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
and therefore our substitutes and shall
 
06:31:21.190 --> 06:31:21.200 align:start position:0%
always be
 
06:31:23.510 --> 06:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
accountable to the people
 
06:31:26.310 --> 06:31:26.320 align:start position:0%
without a bill like this we have already
 
06:31:29.190 --> 06:31:29.200 align:start position:0%
seen proof positive that school boards
 
06:31:31.350 --> 06:31:31.360 align:start position:0%
feel like they know what's best they
 
06:31:33.590 --> 06:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
don't care what the parents say and it's
 
06:31:36.150 --> 06:31:36.160 align:start position:0%
time for the parents to be empowered to
 
06:31:38.230 --> 06:31:38.240 align:start position:0%
do what's right for their kids
 
06:31:40.628 --> 06:31:40.638 align:start position:0%

earlier my father spent seven years in
 
06:32:26.468 --> 06:32:26.478 align:start position:0%
it in a communist prison it's a it's
 
06:32:28.708 --> 06:32:28.718 align:start position:0%
called a re-education camp but there's
 
06:32:31.030 --> 06:32:31.040 align:start position:0%
no education you just work physically
 
06:32:33.190 --> 06:32:33.200 align:start position:0%
hard and they leave you to die when you
 
06:32:34.310 --> 06:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
get sick
 
06:32:36.390 --> 06:32:36.400 align:start position:0%
that's what it is so
 
06:32:38.390 --> 06:32:38.400 align:start position:0%
we lived through it
 
06:32:38.400 --> 06:32:39.990 align:start position:0%
we lived through it
and

06:32:39.990 --> 06:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:32:43.030 --> 06:32:43.040 align:start position:0%
i thought i come to america
 
06:32:45.110 --> 06:32:45.120 align:start position:0%

but
 
06:32:46.718 --> 06:32:47.830 align:start position:0%
but
we

06:32:47.830 --> 06:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
we
 
06:32:50.390 --> 06:32:50.400 align:start position:0%
are becoming like a communist country
 
06:32:54.548 --> 06:32:54.558 align:start position:0%
like vietnam and china and north korea
 
06:32:56.868 --> 06:32:56.878 align:start position:0%
and we lived it trust me
 
06:32:58.708 --> 06:32:58.718 align:start position:0%
i know
 
06:33:00.628 --> 06:33:00.638 align:start position:0%
other people hear that one communist and
 
06:33:03.750 --> 06:33:03.760 align:start position:0%

06:33:08.878 --> 06:33:10.468 align:start position:0%
nothing if you live through what we live
through

06:33:10.468 --> 06:33:10.478 align:start position:0%
through
 
06:33:14.708 --> 06:33:14.718 align:start position:0%
you all wanna get rid of that ideal
 
06:33:16.468 --> 06:33:16.478 align:start position:0%
that noble thought that everybody is the
 
06:33:16.478 --> 06:33:17.510 align:start position:0%
that noble thought that everybody is the
same

06:33:17.510 --> 06:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
same
 
06:33:20.070 --> 06:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
when i was i went to school in vietnam
 
06:33:22.868 --> 06:33:22.878 align:start position:0%
and i was a good student my mom only
 
06:33:25.430 --> 06:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
know every teacher and she frequented my
 
06:33:27.270 --> 06:33:27.280 align:start position:0%
school all the time
 
06:33:28.868 --> 06:33:28.878 align:start position:0%

06:33:32.390 --> 06:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
school too to this day she reminded me
 
06:33:34.548 --> 06:33:34.558 align:start position:0%
what i wrote in my essay
 
06:33:37.270 --> 06:33:37.280 align:start position:0%
that kind of involvement and yet the
 
06:33:40.468 --> 06:33:40.478 align:start position:0%
school said that i felt ethic class
 
06:33:43.708 --> 06:33:43.718 align:start position:0%
because i did not participate in this
 
06:33:46.948 --> 06:33:46.958 align:start position:0%
extracurricular that the communist party
 
06:33:49.190 --> 06:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
insisted that children a certain age you
 
06:33:51.190 --> 06:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
have to participate in or else you're
 
06:33:53.990 --> 06:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
going to fail your class and i was about
 
06:33:57.430 --> 06:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
to be fell in that class just because
 
06:34:00.150 --> 06:34:00.160 align:start position:0%
i didn't follow every kiss
 
06:34:01.270 --> 06:34:01.280 align:start position:0%
i have to do the thing that the
 
06:34:03.910 --> 06:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
communist party asked everybody to do so
 
06:34:05.510 --> 06:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
my mom had to
 
06:34:07.750 --> 06:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
allow me to participate in these
 
06:34:09.830 --> 06:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
curriculum things that it's nothing to
 
06:34:11.990 --> 06:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
do with education it's just pretty much
 
06:34:14.150 --> 06:34:14.160 align:start position:0%
that boys and girls get in the circle
 
06:34:16.150 --> 06:34:16.160 align:start position:0%
and they're all shaking hands they are
 
06:34:18.468 --> 06:34:18.478 align:start position:0%
dancing and do all these stupid things
 
06:34:18.478 --> 06:34:19.270 align:start position:0%
dancing and do all these stupid things
that

06:34:19.270 --> 06:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:34:21.270 --> 06:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
like everybody is the same but you know
 
06:34:22.390 --> 06:34:22.400 align:start position:0%
what in my
 
06:34:24.948 --> 06:34:24.958 align:start position:0%
vietnam women girl and boy you have to
 
06:34:28.150 --> 06:34:28.160 align:start position:0%
be separate and we have to be proper
 
06:34:30.150 --> 06:34:30.160 align:start position:0%
and yet this kind of stuff
 
06:34:32.708 --> 06:34:32.718 align:start position:0%
taking away the innocence of the child
 
06:34:35.270 --> 06:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
it really is ruined the parents control
 
06:34:38.150 --> 06:34:38.160 align:start position:0%
and it create problems for them to have
 
06:34:40.788 --> 06:34:40.798 align:start position:0%
teenagers pregnancies and all that you
 
06:34:43.110 --> 06:34:43.120 align:start position:0%
know and yet i was about to be fair for
 
06:34:45.590 --> 06:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
ethic for not participating in those
 
06:34:45.600 --> 06:34:47.510 align:start position:0%
ethic for not participating in those
activities

06:34:47.510 --> 06:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
activities
 
06:34:51.270 --> 06:34:51.280 align:start position:0%
and here i went to the windham audit in
 
06:34:55.590 --> 06:34:55.600 align:start position:0%
concord for 15 days i am as an adult and
 
06:34:58.708 --> 06:34:58.718 align:start position:0%
i have been bullied so many times every
 
06:35:00.868 --> 06:35:00.878 align:start position:0%
time that my mask happened to follow me
 
06:35:03.270 --> 06:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
off me all below my nose
 
06:35:04.868 --> 06:35:04.878 align:start position:0%
people like
 
06:35:07.350 --> 06:35:07.360 align:start position:0%
get it up there they get into my face
 
06:35:09.350 --> 06:35:09.360 align:start position:0%
and tell me to put it up there but it's
 
06:35:11.190 --> 06:35:11.200 align:start position:0%
okay for you to take it off and drink
 
06:35:11.200 --> 06:35:11.910 align:start position:0%
okay for you to take it off and drink
your

06:35:11.910 --> 06:35:11.920 align:start position:0%

06:35:14.310 --> 06:35:14.320 align:start position:0%
water eat your apple whatever it's okay
 
06:35:15.910 --> 06:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
but the minute your mask fell off just
 
06:35:18.310 --> 06:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
below here they came over and sticking
 
06:35:19.830 --> 06:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
my face like that
 
06:35:22.468 --> 06:35:22.478 align:start position:0%
putting in my face like that so i'm as
 
06:35:26.070 --> 06:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
adult i know how to defend myself
 
06:35:28.310 --> 06:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
what about these poor kids
 
06:35:31.670 --> 06:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
you know there's no emergency why do you
 
06:35:33.670 --> 06:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
make the kids have to put all that over
 
06:35:37.350 --> 06:35:37.360 align:start position:0%
their face that is abuse of children
 
06:35:39.270 --> 06:35:39.280 align:start position:0%
that's a form of abuse
 
06:35:41.430 --> 06:35:41.440 align:start position:0%
you know i went to so many school board
 
06:35:41.440 --> 06:35:43.030 align:start position:0%
you know i went to so many school board
meetings

06:35:43.030 --> 06:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
06:35:45.030 --> 06:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
and what ken erin said
 
06:35:47.590 --> 06:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
and david love said it's true
 
06:35:49.910 --> 06:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
the school board treat the parents like
 
06:35:51.750 --> 06:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
the enemies
 
06:35:53.030 --> 06:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
06:35:55.430 --> 06:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
funny to watch like they sit in the
 
06:35:57.670 --> 06:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
cocky like you know you
 
06:35:57.680 --> 06:35:58.310 align:start position:0%
cocky like you know you
we

06:35:58.310 --> 06:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
we
 
06:36:00.548 --> 06:36:00.558 align:start position:0%
listen to you but just
 
06:36:03.270 --> 06:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
hearing but we're not listening and we
 
06:36:06.390 --> 06:36:06.400 align:start position:0%
do what we want anyway
 
06:36:08.468 --> 06:36:08.478 align:start position:0%
you know and if you get excited and
 
06:36:10.310 --> 06:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
emotional about your kids oh you
 
06:36:10.320 --> 06:36:12.150 align:start position:0%
emotional about your kids oh you
terrorists

06:36:12.150 --> 06:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
terrorists
 
06:36:15.190 --> 06:36:15.200 align:start position:0%
traders and all that that is that kind
 
06:36:17.990 --> 06:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
of abusive to the parents
 
06:36:20.948 --> 06:36:20.958 align:start position:0%
so we need to protect our children they
 
06:36:22.390 --> 06:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
are the future
 
06:36:24.548 --> 06:36:24.558 align:start position:0%
and the party of love and peace always
 
06:36:26.708 --> 06:36:26.718 align:start position:0%
talking about that but how do you show
 
06:36:29.110 --> 06:36:29.120 align:start position:0%
love and peace without a smile
 
06:36:30.708 --> 06:36:30.718 align:start position:0%
you can't
 
06:36:32.468 --> 06:36:32.478 align:start position:0%
you know many times i go to all these
 
06:36:35.110 --> 06:36:35.120 align:start position:0%
hearings i don't know who's talking
 
06:36:38.070 --> 06:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
because everybody have that mask on
 
06:36:40.070 --> 06:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
and many times i cannot understand what
 
06:36:42.150 --> 06:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
people talking even though look at their
 
06:36:42.160 --> 06:36:44.310 align:start position:0%
people talking even though look at their
mouth

06:36:44.310 --> 06:36:44.320 align:start position:0%
mouth
 
06:36:45.270 --> 06:36:45.280 align:start position:0%
you know
 
06:36:47.270 --> 06:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
it's hard for people to understand what
 
06:36:49.030 --> 06:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
we were talking about
 
06:36:52.628 --> 06:36:52.638 align:start position:0%
so it's important for us to protect the
 
06:36:52.638 --> 06:36:53.830 align:start position:0%
so it's important for us to protect the
children

06:36:53.830 --> 06:36:53.840 align:start position:0%
children
 
06:36:57.430 --> 06:36:57.440 align:start position:0%
so if mask is a uniform of the school
 
06:36:59.430 --> 06:36:59.440 align:start position:0%
then why is it not everybody don't have
 
06:37:02.310 --> 06:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
to wear the same uniform
 
06:37:02.320 --> 06:37:03.430 align:start position:0%
to wear the same uniform
right

06:37:03.430 --> 06:37:03.440 align:start position:0%
right
 
06:37:06.150 --> 06:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
so if i have money in my pocket and i
 
06:37:09.030 --> 06:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
want to go to this store and say mask
 
06:37:11.190 --> 06:37:11.200 align:start position:0%
must wear masks to walk into this store
 
06:37:13.670 --> 06:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to spend my money here
 
06:37:16.788 --> 06:37:16.798 align:start position:0%
but the taxpayers me included already
 
06:37:18.230 --> 06:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
pay for all these kids to go to this
 
06:37:19.670 --> 06:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
public school
 
06:37:20.788 --> 06:37:20.798 align:start position:0%
if they
 
06:37:23.430 --> 06:37:23.440 align:start position:0%
are not happy with the service there
 
06:37:26.150 --> 06:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
that imposing on that business because
 
06:37:28.070 --> 06:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
into those school boards all they're
 
06:37:30.628 --> 06:37:30.638 align:start position:0%
talking about is the students i was
 
06:37:32.708 --> 06:37:32.718 align:start position:0%
shocked first time i hear that
 
06:37:35.270 --> 06:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
our customers
 
06:37:37.590 --> 06:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
they talking our current
 
06:37:40.948 --> 06:37:40.958 align:start position:0%
customers if you the school boards
 
06:37:44.468 --> 06:37:44.478 align:start position:0%
treating our students as the customers
 
06:37:46.468 --> 06:37:46.478 align:start position:0%
then they must have the right to enter
 
06:37:49.350 --> 06:37:49.360 align:start position:0%
that store or not to spend that money
 
06:37:51.590 --> 06:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
yet the money already advanced to this
 
06:37:54.708 --> 06:37:54.718 align:start position:0%
this door to this school so that money
 
06:37:56.868 --> 06:37:56.878 align:start position:0%
must follow the kiss
 
06:37:58.708 --> 06:37:58.718 align:start position:0%
to compensate for
 
06:38:00.070 --> 06:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
that fund
 
06:38:02.150 --> 06:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
so according to this bill
 
06:38:04.868 --> 06:38:04.878 align:start position:0%
that funding should follow the children
 
06:38:07.270 --> 06:38:07.280 align:start position:0%
and pay for all the extra because these
 
06:38:11.190 --> 06:38:11.200 align:start position:0%
schools don't treat the customer right
 
06:38:13.430 --> 06:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
and one more thing
 
06:38:14.628 --> 06:38:14.638 align:start position:0%
the kids
 
06:38:17.270 --> 06:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
they learn from the young age
 
06:38:19.350 --> 06:38:19.360 align:start position:0%
something where they were just born
 
06:38:21.830 --> 06:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
from even in the womb they hear you they
 
06:38:24.230 --> 06:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
watch you they observe and imitate
 
06:38:26.390 --> 06:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
so if they cannot imitate what they are
 
06:38:27.990 --> 06:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
doing expressing love and stuff like
 
06:38:31.190 --> 06:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
that how can they express themselves
 
06:38:33.030 --> 06:38:33.040 align:start position:0%
we're here for the children everybody on
 
06:38:34.948 --> 06:38:34.958 align:start position:0%
these boys for the children you know how
 
06:38:36.868 --> 06:38:36.878 align:start position:0%
important they are
 
06:38:39.030 --> 06:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
you know so it's not just about
 
06:38:40.868 --> 06:38:40.878 align:start position:0%
knowledge you have to take care of their
 
06:38:42.590 --> 06:38:42.600 align:start position:0%
physical their mental and their
 
06:38:45.670 --> 06:38:45.680 align:start position:0%
psychological health too
 
06:38:48.708 --> 06:38:48.718 align:start position:0%
so look at the suicidal rate and only
 
06:38:51.270 --> 06:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
that many children have asthma a problem
 
06:38:53.270 --> 06:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
how do you expect them to have that mask
 
06:38:55.350 --> 06:38:55.360 align:start position:0%
on their face all day
 
06:38:56.868 --> 06:38:56.878 align:start position:0%
breathing out
 
06:38:59.030 --> 06:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
inhale extra oxygen and breathing out
 
06:39:00.788 --> 06:39:00.798 align:start position:0%
carbon and it's blocked on your face
 
06:39:03.030 --> 06:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
like that so you inhale that's mostly
 
06:39:03.040 --> 06:39:05.190 align:start position:0%
like that so you inhale that's mostly
carbon

06:39:05.190 --> 06:39:05.200 align:start position:0%
carbon
 
06:39:07.350 --> 06:39:07.360 align:start position:0%
you're killing the kid with the mask
 
06:39:07.360 --> 06:39:09.590 align:start position:0%
you're killing the kid with the mask
unnecessarily

06:39:09.590 --> 06:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily
 
06:39:12.468 --> 06:39:12.478 align:start position:0%
that that that is killing
 
06:39:15.750 --> 06:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
that is dangerous endangering the child
 
06:39:18.230 --> 06:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
those people that put these things in
 
06:39:20.708 --> 06:39:20.718 align:start position:0%
should be prosecuted for the crime for
 
06:39:25.030 --> 06:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:25.040 --> 06:39:26.310 align:start position:0%
 
and

06:39:26.310 --> 06:39:26.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:39:27.990 --> 06:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
and not only that you know what
 
06:39:29.670 --> 06:39:29.680 align:start position:0%
everybody walk around the only thing you
 
06:39:31.590 --> 06:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
see is the eyes
 
06:39:33.110 --> 06:39:33.120 align:start position:0%
we all look like we're in a muslim
 
06:39:33.120 --> 06:39:34.788 align:start position:0%
we all look like we're in a muslim
country

06:39:34.788 --> 06:39:34.798 align:start position:0%
country
 
06:39:36.788 --> 06:39:36.798 align:start position:0%
you know nothing against the muslim
 
06:39:38.788 --> 06:39:38.798 align:start position:0%
people i have muslim friends
 
06:39:41.030 --> 06:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
but you know what this is america
 
06:39:43.110 --> 06:39:43.120 align:start position:0%
we have freedom of expression we have
 
06:39:44.548 --> 06:39:44.558 align:start position:0%
freedom of speech
 
06:39:47.030 --> 06:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
but you're taking away our freedom of
 
06:39:49.510 --> 06:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
expression since the child was a kid the
 
06:39:52.150 --> 06:39:52.160 align:start position:0%
kids learned to be submissive and not
 
06:39:54.390 --> 06:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
defending itself for what is right and
 
06:39:56.310 --> 06:39:56.320 align:start position:0%
wrong and their common sense
 
06:39:57.670 --> 06:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
this mask
 
06:40:00.390 --> 06:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
preventing what preventing
 
06:40:01.830 --> 06:40:01.840 align:start position:0%
the the
 
06:40:04.708 --> 06:40:04.718 align:start position:0%
um the germs it's like you preventing a
 
06:40:07.510 --> 06:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
mosquito with a linked fence that's what
 
06:40:08.548 --> 06:40:08.558 align:start position:0%
it is
 
06:40:10.548 --> 06:40:10.558 align:start position:0%
whatever study i don't care that's
 
06:40:12.548 --> 06:40:12.558 align:start position:0%
common sense
 
06:40:15.270 --> 06:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
so it's not just about the mass mandate
 
06:40:17.750 --> 06:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
the money must follow the children in
 
06:40:21.190 --> 06:40:21.200 align:start position:0%
the school the business the school must
 
06:40:23.110 --> 06:40:23.120 align:start position:0%
treat the customer right reimburse the
 
06:40:25.350 --> 06:40:25.360 align:start position:0%
money and follow the kids
 
06:40:27.750 --> 06:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
and i asked for your vote
 
06:40:30.628 --> 06:40:30.638 align:start position:0%
to support this bill thank you very much
 
06:40:33.350 --> 06:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions
 
06:40:35.270 --> 06:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you
 
06:40:36.150 --> 06:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:40:49.910 --> 06:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:51.270 --> 06:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
thank you committee chair thank you
 
06:40:53.670 --> 06:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
06:40:55.830 --> 06:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
the only couple of things i want to say
 
06:40:57.670 --> 06:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
about this is that
 
06:40:59.910 --> 06:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
i have found out recently
 
06:41:03.030 --> 06:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
that our school boards unfortunately
 
06:41:03.040 --> 06:41:04.230 align:start position:0%
that our school boards unfortunately
throughout

06:41:04.230 --> 06:41:04.240 align:start position:0%
throughout
 
06:41:06.628 --> 06:41:06.638 align:start position:0%
our state are not necessarily
 
06:41:10.708 --> 06:41:10.718 align:start position:0%
representing the majority of the parents
 
06:41:13.190 --> 06:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
i i'm finding this out the hard way
 
06:41:15.750 --> 06:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
because i'm starting to talk to parents
 
06:41:17.270 --> 06:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
i haven't i
 
06:41:19.670 --> 06:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
know a parent of an eight-year-old who
 
06:41:21.590 --> 06:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
suffers from tourettes he has other
 
06:41:23.830 --> 06:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
issues as well stuff is from tourette's
 
06:41:26.310 --> 06:41:26.320 align:start position:0%
his tourette's comes out through ticks
 
06:41:27.990 --> 06:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
i don't know if you folks are familiar
 
06:41:30.868 --> 06:41:30.878 align:start position:0%
with what uh tick is but um
 
06:41:33.830 --> 06:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that mask wearing creates
 
06:41:36.150 --> 06:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
a lot of problems for this child he has
 
06:41:38.948 --> 06:41:38.958 align:start position:0%
not been able to leak to go to his
 
06:41:40.310 --> 06:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
public school
 
06:41:42.868 --> 06:41:42.878 align:start position:0%
and have his iep done
 
06:41:46.070 --> 06:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
because he will his parents say i will
 
06:41:49.510 --> 06:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
not abuse my child by forcing him to
 
06:41:51.350 --> 06:41:51.360 align:start position:0%
wear a mask
 
06:41:52.628 --> 06:41:52.638 align:start position:0%
and they've said well you just got to
 
06:41:53.830 --> 06:41:53.840 align:start position:0%
keep trying
 
06:41:55.350 --> 06:41:55.360 align:start position:0%
that's not okay
 
06:41:57.430 --> 06:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
that is not okay well just keep trying
 
06:41:59.030 --> 06:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
to abuse your child
 
06:42:01.270 --> 06:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
just keep trying eventually though
 
06:42:03.350 --> 06:42:03.360 align:start position:0%
eventually they'll comply
 
06:42:05.990 --> 06:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
students are standing up all over the
 
06:42:09.030 --> 06:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
state right now they are being
 
06:42:10.788 --> 06:42:10.798 align:start position:0%
charged attention
 
06:42:13.670 --> 06:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
and being expelled from their schools
 
06:42:15.910 --> 06:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
because they finally said enough is
 
06:42:15.920 --> 06:42:16.788 align:start position:0%
because they finally said enough is
enough

06:42:16.788 --> 06:42:16.798 align:start position:0%
enough
 
06:42:19.590 --> 06:42:19.600 align:start position:0%
i want to speak a little bit to the um
 
06:42:21.510 --> 06:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
to the um
 
06:42:23.110 --> 06:42:23.120 align:start position:0%
sighting of the
 
06:42:26.948 --> 06:42:26.958 align:start position:0%
of the the study that was cited by one
 
06:42:28.948 --> 06:42:28.958 align:start position:0%
of our representatives
 
06:42:31.270 --> 06:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
this is the first randomized controlled
 
06:42:33.270 --> 06:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
trial this is from the study that was
 
06:42:33.280 --> 06:42:34.390 align:start position:0%
trial this is from the study that was
quoted

06:42:34.390 --> 06:42:34.400 align:start position:0%
quoted
 
06:42:36.628 --> 06:42:36.638 align:start position:0%
trial exploring whether facial masking
 
06:42:38.628 --> 06:42:38.638 align:start position:0%
prevents cobit 19
 
06:42:41.110 --> 06:42:41.120 align:start position:0%
transmission at a community level it's
 
06:42:43.510 --> 06:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
also noted that it's in a
 
06:42:45.350 --> 06:42:45.360 align:start position:0%
i i'm sorry i'm not reading the whole
 
06:42:48.788 --> 06:42:48.798 align:start position:0%
quote for time um there's a significant
 
06:42:48.798 --> 06:42:50.310 align:start position:0%
quote for time um there's a significant
risk

06:42:50.310 --> 06:42:50.320 align:start position:0%
risk
 
06:42:52.628 --> 06:42:52.638 align:start position:0%
of of code 19
 
06:42:55.750 --> 06:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
comm of in rule rule and
 
06:42:59.350 --> 06:42:59.360 align:start position:0%
not well where i can't find it
 
06:42:59.360 --> 06:43:05.190 align:start position:0%
not well where i can't find it
um

06:43:05.190 --> 06:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:07.590 --> 06:43:07.600 align:start position:0%
control so this so this whole study that
 
06:43:10.070 --> 06:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
was cited is with in regards to
 
06:43:11.990 --> 06:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
controlled villagers
 
06:43:15.430 --> 06:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
in a third world country
 
06:43:16.788 --> 06:43:16.798 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to bring that to the
 
06:43:19.830 --> 06:43:19.840 align:start position:0%
attention of the committee
 
06:43:22.310 --> 06:43:22.320 align:start position:0%
the bottom line here is we should not be
 
06:43:23.990 --> 06:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
talking about this
 
06:43:25.670 --> 06:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
we should not be talking about this
 
06:43:27.830 --> 06:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
discrimination is discrimination
 
06:43:29.590 --> 06:43:29.600 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether
 
06:43:32.070 --> 06:43:32.080 align:start position:0%
regardless regardless our school should
 
06:43:34.390 --> 06:43:34.400 align:start position:0%
not discriminate our school board should
 
06:43:37.830 --> 06:43:37.840 align:start position:0%
not discriminate our our businesses
 
06:43:39.750 --> 06:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
should not discriminate
 
06:43:42.628 --> 06:43:42.638 align:start position:0%
i'm hearing people from
 
06:43:45.750 --> 06:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
organizations that say
 
06:43:47.990 --> 06:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
it's going to cost a lot of money
 
06:43:49.430 --> 06:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
you know what
 
06:43:51.750 --> 06:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
that's still a form of discrimination
 
06:43:54.868 --> 06:43:54.878 align:start position:0%
the fact that we the public are sitting
 
06:43:57.670 --> 06:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
in here we become more involved we've
 
06:44:01.990 --> 06:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
come here and we try to speak educatedly
 
06:44:05.510 --> 06:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
on a situation we i come for the
 
06:44:08.788 --> 06:44:08.798 align:start position:0%
children that i that i know personally
 
06:44:10.390 --> 06:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
that i've gotten to know
 
06:44:10.400 --> 06:44:11.270 align:start position:0%
that i've gotten to know
through

06:44:11.270 --> 06:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
through
 
06:44:13.030 --> 06:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
facebook groups and some of these other
 
06:44:18.548 --> 06:44:18.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:21.190 --> 06:44:21.200 align:start position:0%
to me that is a form of bullying and it
 
06:44:23.430 --> 06:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
needs to stop
 
06:44:24.548 --> 06:44:24.558 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:44:27.190 --> 06:44:27.200 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions
 
06:44:29.670 --> 06:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
now seeing in hands thank you very much
 
06:44:33.030 --> 06:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
and this closes our hearing today on
 
06:44:33.040 --> 06:45:03.670 align:start position:0%
and this closes our hearing today on
1588.

06:45:03.670 --> 06:45:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:03.680 --> 06:45:19.430 align:start position:0%
 
oh

06:45:19.430 --> 06:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:22.468 --> 06:45:22.478 align:start position:0%
i know but i'm gonna post it on facebook
 
06:45:56.070 --> 06:45:56.080 align:start position:0%
