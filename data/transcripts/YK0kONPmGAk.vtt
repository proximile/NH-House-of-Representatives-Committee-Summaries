division one bills
 
00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:02.720 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh the first bill
 
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
we have is
 
00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
senate bill 227 it came to us
 
00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:11.600 align:start position:0%
by and large complete except that we we
 
00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:12.800 align:start position:0%
did amend it
 
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
to add corrections officers which is
 
00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
starting on line 16
 
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
so we didn't have an amendment to the
 
00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:20.469 align:start position:0%
so we didn't have an amendment to the
bill

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:20.479 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
other than that it's already unchanged
 
00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.080 align:start position:0%
i'd ask representative griffin to speak
 
00:06:31.749 --> 00:06:31.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:32.710 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:34.639 align:start position:0%
the amendment uh
 
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
as parole officers and certain other
 
00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:38.800 align:start position:0%
class two
 
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.430 align:start position:0%
class two
employees

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:44.560 align:start position:0%
we heard testimony from the uh
 
00:06:47.189 --> 00:06:47.199 align:start position:0%
from the public and the professionals
 
00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:49.919 align:start position:0%
that suicide was
 
00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:51.670 align:start position:0%
that suicide was
quite

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
quite
 
00:06:53.749 --> 00:06:53.759 align:start position:0%
often rare it wasn't
 
00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
a normal thing it may be a
 
00:06:58.469 --> 00:06:58.479 align:start position:0%
less than a half a dozen a year
 
00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
in the worst case scenario
 
00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:03.919 align:start position:0%
and we also
 
00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
felt that adding a few employees as
 
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
parole offices and things would
 
00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
not likely have a major impact on the
 
00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:14.560 align:start position:0%
bill so all in all
 
00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
uh division one supported the bill with
 
00:07:22.629 --> 00:07:22.639 align:start position:0%

00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
you're looking at a cost of over six
 
00:20:55.909 --> 00:20:55.919 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for potential household
 
00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
to me that's just a an extraordinarily
 
00:20:59.830 --> 00:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
poor way of spending this money whether
 
00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
it's considered free from the federal
 
00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
government and not
 
00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
so i will be uh voting against thank you
 
00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:07.360 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
represent emrick would you like to uh
 
00:21:12.549 --> 00:21:12.559 align:start position:0%
respond to that please
 
00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:21.909 --> 00:21:21.919 align:start position:0%
we did we asked that question
 
00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
uh and it got into the debate of the
 
00:21:26.149 --> 00:21:26.159 align:start position:0%
last mile
 
00:21:28.549 --> 00:21:28.559 align:start position:0%
and who how how expensive the last mile
 
00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
really is
 
00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:32.320 align:start position:0%
several things came up one is the
 
00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:34.400 align:start position:0%
definition of uh
 
00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
under construction
 
00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:38.480 align:start position:0%
in this industry actually negotiating
 
00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
for polls to hang the lines on is
 
00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
considered under construction
 
00:21:44.789 --> 00:21:44.799 align:start position:0%
that's where this challenge for a
 
00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
successful challenge came from
 
00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
the other issue had to do with who takes
 
00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:51.280 align:start position:0%
care of them once they're installed
 
00:21:53.909 --> 00:21:53.919 align:start position:0%
because the bill didn't specify that and
 
00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
in fact once a line goes live with a
 
00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
carrier say it's a con comcast becomes
 
00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
the provider on that line they're
 
00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
responsible for maintenance that from
 
00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
that point on
 
00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:08.320 align:start position:0%
but as far as the the cost
 
00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:10.149 align:start position:0%
but as far as the the cost
uh

00:22:10.149 --> 00:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
that it's very expensive the last mile
 
00:22:14.789 --> 00:22:14.799 align:start position:0%
is very expensive
 
00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:17.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for that exponent oh
 
00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
i'm sure
 
00:22:20.549 --> 00:22:20.559 align:start position:0%
thank you for the explanation that you
 
00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:22.559 align:start position:0%
i'm aware of those that
 
00:22:25.029 --> 00:22:25.039 align:start position:0%
really doesn't address the initial
 
00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
my initial point
 
00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
which is i'm not asking a question i'm
 
00:22:29.909 --> 00:22:29.919 align:start position:0%
making the point that this is an
 
00:22:31.909 --> 00:22:31.919 align:start position:0%
extremely expensive
 
00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
and i think unwise way to spend 122
 
00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
million dollars thank you
 
00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
representative hatch
 
00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
representative emmerich made most of my
 
00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
points but so
 
00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
27 000 individuals sounds de minimis
 
00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
compared to the overall population of
 
00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
the state but consider this please uh
 
00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
almost one third of the state
 
00:22:57.510 --> 00:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
encompasses thirteen thousand people
 
00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
just keep that in mind thank you
 
00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:04.789 --> 00:23:04.799 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't be referring to colas
 
00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:07.090 align:start position:0%
county would you
 
00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:11.510 align:start position:0%
county would you
[Laughter]

00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:27.669 --> 00:23:27.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:27.679 --> 00:23:29.750 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh yeah i'm being
 
00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
from coast uh
 
00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
it is the the largest county not only
 
00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
that but
 
00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
the most rural
 
00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
county in all of the state so
 
00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
the last mile is expensive because the
 
00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
towns and homes are extremely
 
00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
you know spread out
 
00:23:52.789 --> 00:23:52.799 align:start position:0%
so that's why i think the bill is
 
00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
necessary to do at least
 
00:23:58.230 --> 00:23:58.240 align:start position:0%
you know wire the people um
 
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
so that we can get things done properly
 
00:24:02.549 --> 00:24:02.559 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of we have uh 23
 
00:24:04.549 --> 00:24:04.559 align:start position:0%
unincorporated places
 
00:24:06.549 --> 00:24:06.559 align:start position:0%
most of them aren't occupied but at
 
00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
least you know this bill would help
 
00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
connect people in remote areas so i'm in
 
00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
is there any further
 
00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:19.909 align:start position:0%
is there any further
discussion

00:24:19.909 --> 00:24:19.919 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
sorry represent
 
00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:25.269 align:start position:0%
sorry represent
edwards

00:24:25.269 --> 00:24:25.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:27.440 align:start position:0%
following up kind of on representative
 
00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
turcotte's comment um
 
00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:32.720 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that a hundred percent of
 
00:24:35.269 --> 00:24:35.279 align:start position:0%
the people uh whose houses are going to
 
00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
be affected by this
 
00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
bought their house
 
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
knowing what the internet uh
 
00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
connectivity was
 
00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
uh and because we have federal money
 
00:24:45.669 --> 00:24:45.679 align:start position:0%
we're going to go ahead and spend it in
 
00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
a profligate way
 
00:24:50.149 --> 00:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
and maybe maybe we should do that but
 
00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
this is a little bit like
 
00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
somebody buying a house next to an
 
00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:55.110 align:start position:0%
somebody buying a house next to an
airport

00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:55.120 align:start position:0%
airport
 
00:24:57.909 --> 00:24:57.919 align:start position:0%
and then having federal money to move
 
00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
to move the airport uh it's it's it's
 
00:25:03.909 --> 00:25:03.919 align:start position:0%
pretty much equivalent to that so
 
00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:05.200 align:start position:0%
i'm um
 
00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
i'm conflicted about voting for this um
 
00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
you know because i think property owners
 
00:25:13.269 --> 00:25:13.279 align:start position:0%
know what they're buying when they buy
 
00:25:13.279 --> 00:25:18.870 align:start position:0%
know what they're buying when they buy
it

00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
representative hatch
 
00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
thank you i do not desire to belabor
 
00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
this but let me just point out this
 
00:25:27.029 --> 00:25:27.039 align:start position:0%
that where i live
 
00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
a proponent of the people bought their
 
00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:30.230 align:start position:0%
a proponent of the people bought their
houses

00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
houses
 
00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
long before the internet existed just
 
00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairs um
 
00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
i'm a sub and the newbie so i i
 
00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate your allowing me to speak
 
00:25:55.029 --> 00:25:55.039 align:start position:0%
i'll be brief
 
00:25:57.909 --> 00:25:57.919 align:start position:0%
i mean the point of the ara funds from
 
00:25:59.669 --> 00:25:59.679 align:start position:0%
the federal government
 
00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
was because correct me if i'm wrong
 
00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
during covid people needed access to
 
00:26:09.909 --> 00:26:09.919 align:start position:0%
the internet where they were for their
 
00:26:09.919 --> 00:26:10.870 align:start position:0%
the internet where they were for their
kids

00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
kids
 
00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
or if they're teachers to teach those
 
00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:13.909 align:start position:0%
or if they're teachers to teach those
kids

00:26:13.909 --> 00:26:13.919 align:start position:0%
kids
 
00:26:16.549 --> 00:26:16.559 align:start position:0%
or if they are workers that were
 
00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
sent away from their office
 
00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
regardless of your views of covet that
 
00:26:22.789 --> 00:26:22.799 align:start position:0%
is what happened
 
00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
and this
 
00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
had been an item that many of us
 
00:26:31.029 --> 00:26:31.039 align:start position:0%
regardless of if we're from coast or not
 
00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
felt that our entire state
 
00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
to move forward in this economy needs to
 
00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:37.029 align:start position:0%
to move forward in this economy needs to
have

00:26:37.029 --> 00:26:37.039 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:39.200 align:start position:0%
that level of access
 
00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:40.549 align:start position:0%
that level of access
so

00:26:40.549 --> 00:26:40.559 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
we can have a better shot at various
 
00:26:45.269 --> 00:26:45.279 align:start position:0%
businesses to attract businesses small
 
00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
business big businesses but really
 
00:26:51.669 --> 00:26:51.679 align:start position:0%
this came out of the immense need
 
00:26:55.029 --> 00:26:55.039 align:start position:0%
for children kids and workers to have
 
00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
access to their workplace in their
 
00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:58.549 align:start position:0%
access to their workplace in their
schools

00:26:58.549 --> 00:26:58.559 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:00.640 align:start position:0%
i belie i do believe
 
00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:02.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:27:05.669 --> 00:27:05.679 align:start position:0%

a clarification
 
00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:25.919 align:start position:0%
my understanding was
 
00:34:29.589 --> 00:34:29.599 align:start position:0%
the fema part is split 75 25
 
00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
but that this did not apply to any of
 
00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:32.310 align:start position:0%
but that this did not apply to any of
that

00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
this applied to anything in excess of
 
00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:39.510 align:start position:0%
this applied to anything in excess of
that

00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:41.190 align:start position:0%
 
no

00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
this just applies to the
 
00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:46.240 align:start position:0%
the match
 
00:34:48.950 --> 00:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
fema puts in some amount
 
00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:49.909 align:start position:0%
fema puts in some amount
okay

00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:49.919 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
and this only applies to the non-fema
 
00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:55.270 align:start position:0%
and this only applies to the non-fema
money

00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:56.560 align:start position:0%
what the
 
00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:03.200 align:start position:0%
and we also if you notice in there that
 
00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:04.870 align:start position:0%
and we also if you notice in there that
um

00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
homeland our our homeland security
 
00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:12.310 align:start position:0%
homeland our our homeland security
area

00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
area
 
00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
will be
 
00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
managing this
 
00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
grant program could i ask one more
 
00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
question surely so just to be sure i
 
00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
understand to the extent that
 
00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:24.640 align:start position:0%
the cost of the disaster exceeds the
 
00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
state plus the
 
00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:28.720 align:start position:0%
federal share of the fema portion to
 
00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
extent that exceeds that fema
 
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
calculation that the local community
 
00:35:35.109 --> 00:35:35.119 align:start position:0%
will be picking up that that excess
 
00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
that's correct thank you
 
00:35:39.109 --> 00:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
this is only for
 
00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
fema approved
 
00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:43.589 align:start position:0%
fema approved
repairs

00:35:43.589 --> 00:35:43.599 align:start position:0%
repairs
 
00:35:45.829 --> 00:35:45.839 align:start position:0%
or whatever
 
00:35:49.349 --> 00:35:49.359 align:start position:0%
representative thank you madam chair um
 
00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:51.200 align:start position:0%
just for those who weren't in division
 
00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:52.960 align:start position:0%
two during the discussion on this bill
 
00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
and uh the next one we will be talking
 
00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:57.109 align:start position:0%
and uh the next one we will be talking
about

00:35:57.109 --> 00:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
the for me and much of the discussion on
 
00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:02.480 align:start position:0%
this particular bill came down to the
 
00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
the difference between whether it was a
 
00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:05.829 align:start position:0%
the difference between whether it was a
grant

00:36:05.829 --> 00:36:05.839 align:start position:0%
grant
 
00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:08.240 align:start position:0%
or a loan and as we get into the next
 
00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
bill you will see that one uh talks
 
00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
about loans
 
00:36:13.109 --> 00:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
and some of the discussion on this
 
00:36:15.829 --> 00:36:15.839 align:start position:0%
because it is a grant rather than
 
00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
um alone
 
00:36:19.109 --> 00:36:19.119 align:start position:0%
um there were concerns about the
 
00:36:19.119 --> 00:36:20.230 align:start position:0%
um there were concerns about the
political

00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
political
 
00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:22.880 align:start position:0%
implications you know in certain times
 
00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
is is one person gonna uh
 
00:36:30.069 --> 00:36:30.079 align:start position:0%
well is one party going to allow a
 
00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
municipality to receive money or are
 
00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:34.720 align:start position:0%
they not the other big thing was
 
00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:36.710 align:start position:0%
they not the other big thing was
mitigation

00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
mitigation
 
00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
we talked about uh
 
00:36:41.109 --> 00:36:41.119 align:start position:0%
nationally some of the the same places
 
00:36:41.119 --> 00:36:42.069 align:start position:0%
nationally some of the the same places
that

00:36:42.069 --> 00:36:42.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:44.720 align:start position:0%
receive disaster relief over and over
 
00:36:46.870 --> 00:36:46.880 align:start position:0%
and over again without mitigating the
 
00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
underlying condition
 
00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:51.680 align:start position:0%
and by going to a grant rather than loan
 
00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:52.630 align:start position:0%
and by going to a grant rather than loan
um

00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:52.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:54.880 align:start position:0%
that you we may put ourselves in the
 
00:36:57.510 --> 00:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
situation of there's not quite as
 
00:36:59.670 --> 00:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't become
 
00:37:01.589 --> 00:37:01.599 align:start position:0%
mitigation doesn't become quite as
 
00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:03.440 align:start position:0%
important if you're just receiving a
 
00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
grant from the state
 
00:37:08.069 --> 00:37:08.079 align:start position:0%
so on this particular bill i will vote
 
00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
against it knowing that we do have
 
00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
another bill that we've worked
 
00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:14.720 align:start position:0%
on coming up that talks about disaster
 
00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:16.880 align:start position:0%
relief in the form of loans thank you
 
00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:26.710 --> 00:37:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
represent lynn yeah i i want to say i i
 
00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
um i i initially
 
00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh i i shared the concerns that that
 
00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte
 
00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:38.960 align:start position:0%
raised but i
 
00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
i really think that the way this um uh
 
00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
grant proposal has been drafted it
 
00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:46.640 align:start position:0%
really is fairly limited i mean if i
 
00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
understand it correctly basically you're
 
00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
saying the most that the grant could be
 
00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
would be 12 and a half percent of what
 
00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:54.390 align:start position:0%
would be 12 and a half percent of what
the

00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
total fema
 
00:37:57.430 --> 00:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
award was
 
00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
um and i think uh and and and it's not
 
00:38:03.109 --> 00:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
that this is not
 
00:38:05.109 --> 00:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
an entitlement to a grant it just says
 
00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
you can apply for it and the governor
 
00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
and council and the fiscal committee
 
00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
have to approve so i think with those
 
00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
limit to all those limitations i'm i'm
 
00:38:14.069 --> 00:38:14.079 align:start position:0%
comfortable with uh with the way this is
 
00:38:14.079 --> 00:38:17.589 align:start position:0%
comfortable with uh with the way this is
worded

00:38:17.589 --> 00:38:17.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
okay sorry for my confusion we uh we
 
00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
were kind of interchanging 402 and 409
 
00:38:25.349 --> 00:38:25.359 align:start position:0%
the whole
 
00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
in our in our whole discussion um
 
00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:32.560 align:start position:0%
we knew that one was a grant one was
 
00:38:33.829 --> 00:38:33.839 align:start position:0%
alone and
 
00:38:33.839 --> 00:38:34.710 align:start position:0%
alone and
that's

00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:34.720 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
that's kind of where we uh where we
 
00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
got a lot confused on uh
 
00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
on what we were doing
 
00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
uh but
 
00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
i do believe that um
 
00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:51.200 align:start position:0%
homeland security knows that we
 
00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
are very much
 
00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:56.640 align:start position:0%
concerned about hazard mitigation
 
00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
and uh we also know that in order to
 
00:39:05.349 --> 00:39:05.359 align:start position:0%
qualify i guess is the right term
 
00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
for fema money you have to have a hazard
 
00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:09.430 align:start position:0%
for fema money you have to have a hazard
mitigation

00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:09.440 align:start position:0%
mitigation
 
00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:10.870 align:start position:0%
mitigation
plan

00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
plan
 
00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
you have to be
 
00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
from homeland security you will have to
 
00:39:21.349 --> 00:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
be making progress on that mitigation so
 
00:39:21.359 --> 00:39:22.950 align:start position:0%
be making progress on that mitigation so
um

00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:24.069 align:start position:0%
um
it's

00:39:24.069 --> 00:39:24.079 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:39:24.079 --> 00:39:25.349 align:start position:0%
it's
whatever

00:39:25.349 --> 00:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
00:39:25.359 --> 00:39:26.550 align:start position:0%
whatever
okay

00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:26.560 align:start position:0%

okay go ahead
 
00:48:44.790 --> 00:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um
 
00:48:48.150 --> 00:48:48.160 align:start position:0%
this amendment uh attempts to clean up
 
00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
some miscues that happened during the
 
00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
budgeting process
 
00:48:55.349 --> 00:48:55.359 align:start position:0%
there was absolutely no doubt that the
 
00:48:57.910 --> 00:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
both houses the senate and the house
 
00:48:59.910 --> 00:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to increase nursing home
 
00:49:03.030 --> 00:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rates by five percent
 
00:49:08.390 --> 00:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
effective uh july 1 of uh 2021.
 
00:49:10.549 --> 00:49:10.559 align:start position:0%
apparently raising
 
00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rates
 
00:49:15.589 --> 00:49:15.599 align:start position:0%
is a dark art that's very complicated
 
00:49:15.599 --> 00:49:16.630 align:start position:0%
is a dark art that's very complicated
and

00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:16.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:17.589 align:start position:0%
and
so

00:49:17.589 --> 00:49:17.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:49:17.599 --> 00:49:18.549 align:start position:0%
so
what

00:49:18.549 --> 00:49:18.559 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:49:21.349 --> 00:49:21.359 align:start position:0%
we thought we had done we actually
 
00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
failed to achieve uh there wasn't enough
 
00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:25.270 align:start position:0%
failed to achieve uh there wasn't enough
money

00:49:25.270 --> 00:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:49:27.270 --> 00:49:27.280 align:start position:0%
available to
 
00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:30.640 align:start position:0%
to cover the five percent so so since
 
00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
these things get adjusted quarterly
 
00:49:34.390 --> 00:49:34.400 align:start position:0%
there was a
 
00:49:36.549 --> 00:49:36.559 align:start position:0%
first quarter adjustment
 
00:49:38.870 --> 00:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
and a second quarter adjustment and and
 
00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
both of those were
 
00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
significantly below the five percent
 
00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
what what this bill does is it uh works
 
00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:49.589 align:start position:0%
what what this bill does is it uh works
to

00:49:49.589 --> 00:49:49.599 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:49:51.990 --> 00:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
make good on the legislature's promise
 
00:49:53.910 --> 00:49:53.920 align:start position:0%
of a five percent increase to the
 
00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
nursing homes
 
00:49:59.589 --> 00:49:59.599 align:start position:0%
um and uh it appropriates five million
 
00:50:01.750 --> 00:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
dollars to to cover the cost of that
 
00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:04.720 align:start position:0%
nursing home reimbursement rate
 
00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:06.720 align:start position:0%
if we don't need all five million
 
00:50:09.270 --> 00:50:09.280 align:start position:0%
dollars between now and the end of june
 
00:50:10.829 --> 00:50:10.839 align:start position:0%
uh that money will
 
00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
lapse but apparently because this is so
 
00:50:15.990 --> 00:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
complicated to calculate reimbursement
 
00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:18.880 align:start position:0%
rates it's possible that we may be
 
00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:20.720 align:start position:0%
underestimating again
 
00:50:23.670 --> 00:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
and so it leaves open an escape hatch
 
00:50:27.030 --> 00:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
for the commissioner to write us to let
 
00:50:28.549 --> 00:50:28.559 align:start position:0%
us know whether or not there's going to
 
00:50:31.349 --> 00:50:31.359 align:start position:0%
be enough money to cover our promises
 
00:50:31.359 --> 00:50:32.790 align:start position:0%
be enough money to cover our promises
so

00:50:32.790 --> 00:50:32.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:50:35.109 --> 00:50:35.119 align:start position:0%
i i don't understand why it's so hard
 
00:50:37.510 --> 00:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
but but that's why i'm just a legislator
 
00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
and not an accountant so i
 
00:50:42.150 --> 00:50:42.160 align:start position:0%
i would ask for your support on this
 
00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:43.829 align:start position:0%
i would ask for your support on this
bill

00:50:43.829 --> 00:50:43.839 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:50:57.670 --> 00:50:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
i need i need to uh take a quick recess
 
00:51:04.309 --> 00:51:04.319 align:start position:0%

yes

445 is
 
00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
that's another one with abstentions
 
00:53:08.710 --> 00:53:08.720 align:start position:0%
oh no
 
00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:17.760 align:start position:0%

11
 
00:53:49.829 --> 00:53:49.839 align:start position:0%
11 votes yes
 
00:53:51.349 --> 00:53:51.359 align:start position:0%
maybe i still don't
 
00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:02.390 align:start position:0%
 
sure

00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:04.230 align:start position:0%
sure
but

00:54:04.230 --> 00:54:04.240 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:54:06.390 --> 00:54:06.400 align:start position:0%
you you got you you got to
 
00:54:08.829 --> 00:54:08.839 align:start position:0%
who said what right
 
00:54:11.270 --> 00:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
yes yeah see we didn't have a whip sheet
 
00:54:13.109 --> 00:54:13.119 align:start position:0%
like that we just
 
00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
y and n
 
00:54:15.910 --> 00:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to get these two here
 
00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:17.270 align:start position:0%
we're going to get these two here
extensions

00:54:17.270 --> 00:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
extensions
 
00:54:19.750 --> 00:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
so so when we get in between here if i
 
00:54:36.630 --> 00:54:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:50.630 align:start position:0%
 
this

00:54:50.630 --> 00:54:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:54.710 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:54:54.710 --> 00:54:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:58.150 --> 00:54:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:01.430 --> 00:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
needed a further explanation of uh of
 
00:55:03.990 --> 00:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
this amendment which
 
00:55:06.630 --> 00:55:06.640 align:start position:0%
seemed to me to be confusing
 
00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:07.589 align:start position:0%
seemed to me to be confusing
so

00:55:07.589 --> 00:55:07.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:55:11.510 --> 00:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh if i understand correctly
 
00:55:14.390 --> 00:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
from our little conversation
 
00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:19.030 align:start position:0%
from our little conversation
that

00:55:19.030 --> 00:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:20.630 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:55:20.630 --> 00:55:20.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:55:24.150 --> 00:55:24.160 align:start position:0%
the five the five million dollars
 
00:55:25.589 --> 00:55:25.599 align:start position:0%
will only
 
00:55:28.230 --> 00:55:28.240 align:start position:0%
be appropriated
 
00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:29.270 align:start position:0%
be appropriated
if

00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:55:32.390 --> 00:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
hhs runs out of money
 
00:55:34.870 --> 00:55:34.880 align:start position:0%
and they send a letter
 
00:55:36.549 --> 00:55:36.559 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:55:38.230 --> 00:55:38.240 align:start position:0%
the governor
 
00:55:40.309 --> 00:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
the senate president and the speaker of
 
00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
the house
 
00:55:44.710 --> 00:55:44.720 align:start position:0%
and then from there
 
00:55:47.349 --> 00:55:47.359 align:start position:0%
the governor would draw a warrant up to
 
00:55:49.829 --> 00:55:49.839 align:start position:0%
whatever the dollar value
 
00:55:51.750 --> 00:55:51.760 align:start position:0%
was needed
 
00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:55.829 --> 00:55:55.839 align:start position:0%
i think i think that's an accurate
 
00:55:57.910 --> 00:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
summary okay
 
00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:02.710 --> 00:56:02.720 align:start position:0%
uh i think this is a first time for me
 
00:56:03.910 --> 00:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
to see us
 
00:56:06.630 --> 00:56:06.640 align:start position:0%
asking the governor like this but
 
00:56:08.710 --> 00:56:08.720 align:start position:0%
as long as this works we'll
 
00:56:11.349 --> 00:56:11.359 align:start position:0%
be okay so don't ask me any questions
 
00:56:12.789 --> 00:56:12.799 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
00:56:15.030 --> 00:56:15.040 align:start position:0%
there are people here who can answer
 
00:56:16.710 --> 00:56:16.720 align:start position:0%
questions so
 
00:56:18.549 --> 00:56:18.559 align:start position:0%
are there any questions on this
 
00:56:18.559 --> 00:56:19.670 align:start position:0%
are there any questions on this
amendment

00:56:19.670 --> 00:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:21.030 align:start position:0%
amendment
yes

00:56:21.030 --> 00:56:21.040 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:56:22.549 --> 00:56:22.559 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to understand have we
 
00:56:24.150 --> 00:56:24.160 align:start position:0%
been paying the reimbursement at the
 
00:56:26.309 --> 00:56:26.319 align:start position:0%
higher rate even though this got messed
 
00:56:30.549 --> 00:56:30.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:34.470 --> 00:56:34.480 align:start position:0%
uh representative edwards the uh
 
00:56:37.829 --> 00:56:37.839 align:start position:0%
with the quarter that began january 1 we
 
00:56:40.150 --> 00:56:40.160 align:start position:0%
we got to the 5
 
00:56:42.470 --> 00:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
in the first quarter
 
00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:44.720 align:start position:0%
when the this was supposed to be come
 
00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:45.750 align:start position:0%
when the this was supposed to be come
effective

00:56:45.750 --> 00:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
effective
 
00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
i think we only were able to
 
00:56:50.950 --> 00:56:50.960 align:start position:0%
through the calculations uh
 
00:56:52.309 --> 00:56:52.319 align:start position:0%
generate a
 
00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
rate increase of
 
00:56:57.510 --> 00:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
0.2 percent and then in the third
 
00:56:59.190 --> 00:56:59.200 align:start position:0%
entering the second quarter the
 
00:57:02.630 --> 00:57:02.640 align:start position:0%
calculation came up to 3.8 percent
 
00:57:04.069 --> 00:57:04.079 align:start position:0%
so we've been
 
00:57:06.150 --> 00:57:06.160 align:start position:0%
we we're we're good now
 
00:57:09.750 --> 00:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
but we had two low quarters and so
 
00:57:12.549 --> 00:57:12.559 align:start position:0%
we want to go back and retroactively
 
00:57:16.230 --> 00:57:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:17.990 --> 00:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
i understood the only thing i would ask
 
00:57:20.230 --> 00:57:20.240 align:start position:0%
is quarters and just specify the year
 
00:57:24.870 --> 00:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:28.390 --> 00:57:28.400 align:start position:0%
the first quarter started july 2021 of
 
00:57:30.549 --> 00:57:30.559 align:start position:0%
the new budget years you're talking the
 
00:57:32.789 --> 00:57:32.799 align:start position:0%
second half of 2021
 
00:57:35.270 --> 00:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
that we were low
 
00:57:37.430 --> 00:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
that and the reimbursement it depends on
 
00:57:39.670 --> 00:57:39.680 align:start position:0%
what how important the fiscal year is to
 
00:57:42.549 --> 00:57:42.559 align:start position:0%
you it's the first two quarters of the
 
00:57:44.710 --> 00:57:44.720 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:50.230 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
okay

00:57:50.230 --> 00:57:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:56.069 --> 00:57:56.079 align:start position:0%

chair um
 
01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
at first glance this appears to be a
 
01:00:38.309 --> 01:00:38.319 align:start position:0%
substantial amendment
 
01:00:38.319 --> 01:00:39.349 align:start position:0%
substantial amendment
um

01:00:39.349 --> 01:00:39.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:41.589 --> 01:00:41.599 align:start position:0%
let me let me instead of diving into the
 
01:00:44.390 --> 01:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
details i'll save the details for any
 
01:00:46.230 --> 01:00:46.240 align:start position:0%
questions that you may have but i just
 
01:00:48.870 --> 01:00:48.880 align:start position:0%
want to back up and take a look at where
 
01:00:52.470 --> 01:00:52.480 align:start position:0%
we are in the overall process
 
01:00:54.710 --> 01:00:54.720 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire has debated
 
01:00:56.789 --> 01:00:56.799 align:start position:0%
whether or not we should have an adult
 
01:00:59.349 --> 01:00:59.359 align:start position:0%
dental medicaid benefit for a number of
 
01:00:59.359 --> 01:01:01.670 align:start position:0%
dental medicaid benefit for a number of
years

01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:01:04.069 --> 01:01:04.079 align:start position:0%
in this current term
 
01:01:05.349 --> 01:01:05.359 align:start position:0%
there was a
 
01:01:08.069 --> 01:01:08.079 align:start position:0%
close working relationship between
 
01:01:09.910 --> 01:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
the policy committee and the and the
 
01:01:12.630 --> 01:01:12.640 align:start position:0%
finance committee of dhhs
 
01:01:16.950 --> 01:01:16.960 align:start position:0%
we made some uh modifications to um hb
 
01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:19.030 align:start position:0%
we made some uh modifications to um hb
103

01:01:19.030 --> 01:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
103
 
01:01:21.589 --> 01:01:21.599 align:start position:0%
uh passed the house very successfully
 
01:01:23.589 --> 01:01:23.599 align:start position:0%
and um then it
 
01:01:25.589 --> 01:01:25.599 align:start position:0%
reached the senate
 
01:01:27.589 --> 01:01:27.599 align:start position:0%
at the same time because this was so
 
01:01:32.390 --> 01:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
important the senate sent to us
 
01:01:34.789 --> 01:01:34.799 align:start position:0%
senate bill 422.
 
01:01:39.109 --> 01:01:39.119 align:start position:0%
422 was slightly different in that
 
01:01:42.549 --> 01:01:42.559 align:start position:0%
its benefit levels uh were a little bit
 
01:01:42.559 --> 01:01:43.589 align:start position:0%
its benefit levels uh were a little bit
higher

01:01:43.589 --> 01:01:43.599 align:start position:0%
higher
 
01:01:45.510 --> 01:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
they're um
 
01:01:48.390 --> 01:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
but they had identified a nice source of
 
01:01:50.710 --> 01:01:50.720 align:start position:0%
funding for it uh from the centene
 
01:01:54.150 --> 01:01:54.160 align:start position:0%
settlement and uh they also identified
 
01:01:55.589 --> 01:01:55.599 align:start position:0%
that we owed
 
01:01:58.309 --> 01:01:58.319 align:start position:0%
some money um to something called a risk
 
01:02:00.309 --> 01:02:00.319 align:start position:0%
corridor and it's a couple million
 
01:02:01.990 --> 01:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
dollars and change
 
01:02:05.510 --> 01:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
so so what what we we've done at the
 
01:02:07.829 --> 01:02:07.839 align:start position:0%
request of senate bradley and in the
 
01:02:10.630 --> 01:02:10.640 align:start position:0%
senate's hearing of 103
 
01:02:11.710 --> 01:02:11.720 align:start position:0%
is we
 
01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
simultaneously amended
 
01:02:16.470 --> 01:02:16.480 align:start position:0%
hb 103
 
01:02:19.430 --> 01:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
and this represents the
 
01:02:21.029 --> 01:02:21.039 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:02:22.950 --> 01:02:22.960 align:start position:0%
amendment to
 
01:02:25.029 --> 01:02:25.039 align:start position:0%
sb 422
 
01:02:26.950 --> 01:02:26.960 align:start position:0%
so that both bills
 
01:02:28.710 --> 01:02:28.720 align:start position:0%
are identical
 
01:02:31.990 --> 01:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
and uh i believe senate bro senator
 
01:02:33.910 --> 01:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
bradley thought this would be a good
 
01:02:37.510 --> 01:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
idea to make these two bills identical
 
01:02:39.270 --> 01:02:39.280 align:start position:0%
just to make sure that one of them gets
 
01:02:41.430 --> 01:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
passed because we're really wanting to
 
01:02:44.230 --> 01:02:44.240 align:start position:0%
get a dental medicaid benefit passed
 
01:02:46.069 --> 01:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:02:47.990 --> 01:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
and the other reason is if the bills are
 
01:02:50.549 --> 01:02:50.559 align:start position:0%
identical that that cuts down on the
 
01:02:52.309 --> 01:02:52.319 align:start position:0%
whole committee a conference issue and
 
01:02:54.390 --> 01:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
just lets us get this to the governor a
 
01:02:56.390 --> 01:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
little bit more quickly
 
01:02:57.829 --> 01:02:57.839 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:02:59.990 --> 01:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
so if there are specific questions about
 
01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
the amendment i'm i'm happy to entertain
 
01:03:05.029 --> 01:03:05.039 align:start position:0%
them but but the bottom line is this now
 
01:03:07.589 --> 01:03:07.599 align:start position:0%
reads identical to the version that's
 
01:03:10.309 --> 01:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
with the senate and h.b 103
 
01:03:12.470 --> 01:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
it passed their policy committee and i
 
01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
think it's going to hit the their
 
01:03:15.829 --> 01:03:15.839 align:start position:0%
finance committee
 
01:03:18.309 --> 01:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
this week or maybe next but
 
01:03:20.390 --> 01:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
everything looks very favorable for that
 
01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:21.430 align:start position:0%
everything looks very favorable for that
so

01:03:21.430 --> 01:03:21.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:03:23.510 --> 01:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
with with that madam chair i'll i'll
 
01:03:26.150 --> 01:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
take any questions if there are any
 
01:03:30.150 --> 01:03:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:31.670 --> 01:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
seeing none

02:08:57.109 --> 02:08:57.119 align:start position:0%
gold uh colebrook road project but
 
02:08:59.030 --> 02:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
i do have the commissioner from the
 
02:09:01.750 --> 02:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
county behind me who may be able to
 
02:09:03.189 --> 02:09:03.199 align:start position:0%
better answer that question
 
02:09:03.199 --> 02:09:04.470 align:start position:0%
better answer that question
representative

02:09:04.470 --> 02:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:09:05.830 --> 02:09:05.840 align:start position:0%
thank you that would be helpful thank
 
02:09:05.840 --> 02:09:08.390 align:start position:0%
thank you that would be helpful thank
you

02:09:08.390 --> 02:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:10.790 --> 02:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
representative edwards
 
02:09:13.189 --> 02:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
um thank you uh man i'm sure and thank
 
02:09:15.589 --> 02:09:15.599 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um
 
02:09:15.599 --> 02:09:16.709 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um
so

02:09:16.709 --> 02:09:16.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:09:19.669 --> 02:09:19.679 align:start position:0%
i associate dicksville notch with the
 
02:09:19.679 --> 02:09:20.950 align:start position:0%
i associate dicksville notch with the
balsams

02:09:20.950 --> 02:09:20.960 align:start position:0%
balsams
 
02:09:22.550 --> 02:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
and we
 
02:09:24.950 --> 02:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
seemingly the legislature's taken the
 
02:09:24.960 --> 02:09:26.069 align:start position:0%
seemingly the legislature's taken the
position

02:09:26.069 --> 02:09:26.079 align:start position:0%
position
 
02:09:28.310 --> 02:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
that the development of
 
02:09:30.950 --> 02:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
of the balsams should be privately
 
02:09:34.069 --> 02:09:34.079 align:start position:0%
funded so i'm just curious
 
02:09:36.709 --> 02:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
how this road project
 
02:09:39.030 --> 02:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
connects to and supports
 
02:09:41.589 --> 02:09:41.599 align:start position:0%
the enhancement of the balsams resort
 
02:09:41.599 --> 02:09:42.950 align:start position:0%
the enhancement of the balsams resort
project

02:09:42.950 --> 02:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
project
 
02:09:46.709 --> 02:09:46.719 align:start position:0%
and if if this road project is an
 
02:09:48.950 --> 02:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate intervention
 
02:09:51.750 --> 02:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
given a prior decision to have private
 
02:09:55.830 --> 02:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
capital invested in the balsams
 
02:09:58.390 --> 02:09:58.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative the balsams
 
02:09:58.400 --> 02:10:00.149 align:start position:0%
thank you representative the balsams
project

02:10:00.149 --> 02:10:00.159 align:start position:0%
project
 
02:10:00.159 --> 02:10:01.109 align:start position:0%
project
is

02:10:01.109 --> 02:10:01.119 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:10:04.470 --> 02:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
well the owners are trying to secure the
 
02:10:06.629 --> 02:10:06.639 align:start position:0%
appropriate financing as i mentioned
 
02:10:06.639 --> 02:10:07.589 align:start position:0%
appropriate financing as i mentioned
earlier

02:10:07.589 --> 02:10:07.599 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
02:10:10.709 --> 02:10:10.719 align:start position:0%
the road in question in order to
 
02:10:12.950 --> 02:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
make the baltimore's resort more
 
02:10:15.189 --> 02:10:15.199 align:start position:0%
amenable and
 
02:10:17.270 --> 02:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
i guess
 
02:10:17.280 --> 02:10:18.229 align:start position:0%
i guess
better

02:10:18.229 --> 02:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
better
 
02:10:18.239 --> 02:10:19.109 align:start position:0%
better
for

02:10:19.109 --> 02:10:19.119 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:10:21.669 --> 02:10:21.679 align:start position:0%
clients to you know
 
02:10:23.589 --> 02:10:23.599 align:start position:0%
take advantage of those resource the
 
02:10:27.189 --> 02:10:27.199 align:start position:0%
roads leads up to the golf course
 
02:10:28.470 --> 02:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
up above
 
02:10:30.390 --> 02:10:30.400 align:start position:0%
which is a very good golf course it's
 
02:10:32.310 --> 02:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
the only course in new hampshire that
 
02:10:34.709 --> 02:10:34.719 align:start position:0%
looks north to canada east of maine and
 
02:10:36.790 --> 02:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
west of vermont and yet you're still in
 
02:10:36.800 --> 02:10:38.950 align:start position:0%
west of vermont and yet you're still in
vermont

02:10:38.950 --> 02:10:38.960 align:start position:0%
vermont
 
02:10:40.470 --> 02:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
i don't know if i could better answer
 
02:10:45.669 --> 02:10:45.679 align:start position:0%

version

02:11:27.350 --> 02:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
version
 
02:11:29.350 --> 02:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
of the ten year plan which has been
 
02:11:31.430 --> 02:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
dropped because we weren't going to put
 
02:11:33.430 --> 02:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
highway funds into
 
02:11:34.629 --> 02:11:34.639 align:start position:0%
that road
 
02:11:34.639 --> 02:11:35.589 align:start position:0%
that road
um

02:11:35.589 --> 02:11:35.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:38.870 --> 02:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of where where it is and
 
02:11:41.350 --> 02:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
it was heard in our
 
02:11:43.430 --> 02:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
my committee as to whether or not to
 
02:11:45.910 --> 02:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
include this road in the highway plan as
 
02:11:49.910 --> 02:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
it was in the senate and both bodies
 
02:11:51.430 --> 02:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
that deal with
 
02:11:54.069 --> 02:11:54.079 align:start position:0%
the 10-year highway plan have
 
02:11:56.709 --> 02:11:56.719 align:start position:0%
elected not to include it in the 10-year
 
02:11:58.390 --> 02:11:58.400 align:start position:0%
highway plan
 
02:11:59.669 --> 02:11:59.679 align:start position:0%
at least
 
02:12:02.709 --> 02:12:02.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:05.189 --> 02:12:05.199 align:start position:0%
and i've got to go back to my seat
 
02:12:07.030 --> 02:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
i have a question for you representative
 
02:12:10.550 --> 02:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:12.470 --> 02:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
do you want a quick card madam chair
 
02:12:15.030 --> 02:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
yeah i would like a pink card but uh go
 
02:12:16.629 --> 02:12:16.639 align:start position:0%
ahead represent
 
02:12:18.149 --> 02:12:18.159 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you uh
 
02:12:21.510 --> 02:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
representative graham um okay so i'm i i
 
02:12:23.430 --> 02:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
don't do public works i don't do the
 
02:12:25.750 --> 02:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
10-year transportation plan i if you
 
02:12:28.709 --> 02:12:28.719 align:start position:0%
could just give me a an easy education
 
02:12:28.719 --> 02:12:29.750 align:start position:0%
could just give me a an easy education
on

02:12:29.750 --> 02:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:12:32.629 --> 02:12:32.639 align:start position:0%
the correlation between things that go
 
02:12:34.390 --> 02:12:34.400 align:start position:0%
into the 10-year plan
 
02:12:36.950 --> 02:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
and the extent to which that 10-year
 
02:12:38.950 --> 02:12:38.960 align:start position:0%
plan is sort of
 
02:12:41.510 --> 02:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
the definitive guideline to what is in
 
02:12:45.030 --> 02:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
and what is out of our highway planning
 
02:12:47.030 --> 02:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
the short answer is it starts at the
 
02:12:48.470 --> 02:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
town and
 
02:12:49.669 --> 02:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
town level
 
02:12:51.830 --> 02:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
they work with their regional planners
 
02:12:53.990 --> 02:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
to come up with a plan for what should
 
02:12:56.149 --> 02:12:56.159 align:start position:0%
go into
 
02:12:58.950 --> 02:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
the 10-year highway plan which allocates
 
02:13:01.109 --> 02:13:01.119 align:start position:0%
both federal and state funds
 
02:13:03.350 --> 02:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
towards our bridges and roads within the
 
02:13:07.030 --> 02:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
state state roads not not town roads
 
02:13:09.510 --> 02:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
then goes through a series of
 
02:13:12.069 --> 02:13:12.079 align:start position:0%
hearings with
 
02:13:15.270 --> 02:13:15.280 align:start position:0%
the gasset which is the governor's
 
02:13:18.950 --> 02:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
council on uh intermodal transportation
 
02:13:18.960 --> 02:13:19.910 align:start position:0%
council on uh intermodal transportation
and

02:13:19.910 --> 02:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:13:19.920 --> 02:13:20.870 align:start position:0%
and
they

02:13:20.870 --> 02:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
they
 
02:13:22.790 --> 02:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
provide a list
 
02:13:25.910 --> 02:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
a major book to the governor for his
 
02:13:28.950 --> 02:13:28.960 align:start position:0%
perusal and send to us for for look
 
02:13:31.510 --> 02:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
we can make changes um
 
02:13:34.629 --> 02:13:34.639 align:start position:0%
we have in the past
 
02:13:38.149 --> 02:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
but it is definitive on what the state
 
02:13:40.629 --> 02:13:40.639 align:start position:0%
intends to spend money on
 
02:13:42.550 --> 02:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
at least over the next two years until
 
02:13:45.189 --> 02:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
we do the next ten-year plan
 
02:13:47.910 --> 02:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
but it it programs things out ten years
 
02:13:49.030 --> 02:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
so that
 
02:13:51.589 --> 02:13:51.599 align:start position:0%
we can look at what needs to be done in
 
02:13:54.870 --> 02:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
the state in a priority listing
 
02:13:58.149 --> 02:13:58.159 align:start position:0%
of where we are and where we need to
 
02:14:00.950 --> 02:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
improve our transportation in all modes
 
02:14:02.870 --> 02:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
it's not just highways
 
02:14:04.950 --> 02:14:04.960 align:start position:0%
it's uh rail
 
02:14:04.960 --> 02:14:06.709 align:start position:0%
it's uh rail
air

02:14:06.709 --> 02:14:06.719 align:start position:0%
air
 
02:14:08.470 --> 02:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
and the rest and
 
02:14:14.390 --> 02:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
transit also so it's there um so
 
02:14:17.910 --> 02:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
um it's pretty definitive and as i said
 
02:14:19.750 --> 02:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
when we looked at this
 
02:14:22.149 --> 02:14:22.159 align:start position:0%
to find that four million dollars plus
 
02:14:24.390 --> 02:14:24.400 align:start position:0%
or minus we would have had to take an
 
02:14:26.790 --> 02:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
another project out of the 10-year plan
 
02:14:29.750 --> 02:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
because it's fiscally constrained
 
02:14:36.390 --> 02:14:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:38.310 --> 02:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
02:14:40.950 --> 02:14:40.960 align:start position:0%
so so it sounds like this has been duly
 
02:14:44.229 --> 02:14:44.239 align:start position:0%
considered by the uh duly appointed body
 
02:14:46.629 --> 02:14:46.639 align:start position:0%
uh it wasn't included
 
02:14:49.109 --> 02:14:49.119 align:start position:0%
and that this funding would uh be
 
02:14:50.950 --> 02:14:50.960 align:start position:0%
effectively putting this project to the
 
02:14:52.870 --> 02:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
front of the line despite having not
 
02:14:54.950 --> 02:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
gotten there on its own merit
 
02:14:58.149 --> 02:14:58.159 align:start position:0%
it would be outside of the 10-year plan
 
02:15:01.430 --> 02:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
representative edwards and that it would
 
02:15:02.870 --> 02:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
not include
 
02:15:05.350 --> 02:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
either federal highway funding or state
 
02:15:08.390 --> 02:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
highway funding ier gas taxes it would
 
02:15:11.750 --> 02:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
be other funds not appropriated mean in
 
02:15:15.750 --> 02:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
either surplus or someplace else that
 
02:15:18.069 --> 02:15:18.079 align:start position:0%
you and the governor could dictate where
 
02:15:21.510 --> 02:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:23.750 --> 02:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
would it set a precedent maybe
 
02:15:25.510 --> 02:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
maybe not
 
02:15:28.310 --> 02:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
but again it depends on how
 
02:15:30.629 --> 02:15:30.639 align:start position:0%
you look at
 
02:15:32.629 --> 02:15:32.639 align:start position:0%
wanting to develop
 
02:15:35.030 --> 02:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
jobs and other things in the north
 
02:15:37.030 --> 02:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
country and i'm sure you'll hear from
 
02:15:39.350 --> 02:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
people who are sitting behind me
 
02:15:41.430 --> 02:15:41.440 align:start position:0%
probably going to hit me outside the
 
02:15:42.470 --> 02:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
head for
 
02:15:47.589 --> 02:15:47.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:49.830 --> 02:15:49.840 align:start position:0%
uh are there any other questions for uh
 
02:15:52.069 --> 02:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
representative graham
 
02:15:54.550 --> 02:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and if you would
 
02:15:56.790 --> 02:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
would yes i will thank you
 
02:15:58.550 --> 02:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:16:01.510 --> 02:16:01.520 align:start position:0%
okay uh represent to bears did you have
 
02:16:03.990 --> 02:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
anything you wanted to add yes uh to
 
02:16:06.390 --> 02:16:06.400 align:start position:0%
continue as far as the um
 
02:16:08.149 --> 02:16:08.159 align:start position:0%
i've had a couple of meetings with the
 
02:16:10.310 --> 02:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
chair of public works and highways
 
02:16:12.390 --> 02:16:12.400 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that could be done
 
02:16:14.870 --> 02:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
regarding the 10-year plan is that there
 
02:16:16.470 --> 02:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
are two things that could be done one
 
02:16:18.390 --> 02:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
you can ask the municipality to give up
 
02:16:20.709 --> 02:16:20.719 align:start position:0%
their share of the ten of the road of
 
02:16:22.550 --> 02:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
the of the monies for the
 
02:16:25.990 --> 02:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
uh the ten-year plan and give it to the
 
02:16:27.430 --> 02:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
balsams project
 
02:16:29.830 --> 02:16:29.840 align:start position:0%
uh that i testified that that was
 
02:16:32.230 --> 02:16:32.240 align:start position:0%
very very unethical and i would not
 
02:16:33.750 --> 02:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
request that
 
02:16:35.750 --> 02:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
secondly i worked with the commissioner
 
02:16:38.629 --> 02:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
to look at the american rescue plan act
 
02:16:40.950 --> 02:16:40.960 align:start position:0%
monies for that project
 
02:16:43.429 --> 02:16:43.439 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the dot funds were only
 
02:16:46.469 --> 02:16:46.479 align:start position:0%
for transportation and aviation so that
 
02:16:48.070 --> 02:16:48.080 align:start position:0%
is why i was trying to come up with
 
02:16:50.230 --> 02:16:50.240 align:start position:0%
another way of securing
 
02:16:52.309 --> 02:16:52.319 align:start position:0%
funds which may or may not be available
 
02:16:55.589 --> 02:16:55.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:58.830 --> 02:16:58.840 align:start position:0%
further questions from representative
 
02:17:02.469 --> 02:17:02.479 align:start position:0%
burris representative walls
 
02:17:04.389 --> 02:17:04.399 align:start position:0%
so representation i'm just trying to
 
02:17:06.629 --> 02:17:06.639 align:start position:0%
understand this the way i read this is
 
02:17:08.469 --> 02:17:08.479 align:start position:0%
if less saturn gets the money and this
 
02:17:11.030 --> 02:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
is going forward then there's a road is
 
02:17:12.790 --> 02:17:12.800 align:start position:0%
that what this is basically this bill
 
02:17:14.389 --> 02:17:14.399 align:start position:0%
does and without it then there's an
 
02:17:16.549 --> 02:17:16.559 align:start position:0%
inadequate road to this new development
 
02:17:18.309 --> 02:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
so this says if we get the development
 
02:17:19.589 --> 02:17:19.599 align:start position:0%
we're going to have a road that gets you
 
02:17:21.429 --> 02:17:21.439 align:start position:0%
there if we don't get the development we
 
02:17:23.270 --> 02:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
don't have to spend the money that is
 
02:17:23.280 --> 02:17:24.230 align:start position:0%
don't have to spend the money that is
correct

02:17:24.230 --> 02:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:17:30.389 --> 02:17:30.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:35.110 --> 02:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:37.910 --> 02:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you uh
 
02:17:39.910 --> 02:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
representative to bears
 
02:17:43.669 --> 02:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
and i would like to
 
02:17:43.679 --> 02:17:45.910 align:start position:0%
and i would like to
call

02:17:45.910 --> 02:17:45.920 align:start position:0%
call
 
02:17:49.589 --> 02:17:49.599 align:start position:0%
executive councilor joseph kenny
 
02:17:52.070 --> 02:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
when he finishes filling out his pink
 
02:17:52.080 --> 02:18:04.389 align:start position:0%
when he finishes filling out his pink
card

02:18:04.389 --> 02:18:04.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:06.950 --> 02:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
yeah i think your mic isn't on just push
 
02:18:10.070 --> 02:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
morning um so if it says red it's on or
 
02:18:12.389 --> 02:18:12.399 align:start position:0%
off it's on it's on good
 
02:18:13.910 --> 02:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
because in my neck of the woods that
 
02:18:16.150 --> 02:18:16.160 align:start position:0%
means stop
 
02:18:19.669 --> 02:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much um
 
02:18:22.230 --> 02:18:22.240 align:start position:0%
to the finance committee um
 
02:18:24.150 --> 02:18:24.160 align:start position:0%
for letting me speak on behalf of this
 
02:18:24.160 --> 02:18:25.429 align:start position:0%
for letting me speak on behalf of this
amendment

02:18:25.429 --> 02:18:25.439 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:18:28.549 --> 02:18:28.559 align:start position:0%
um as you know this project means a lot
 
02:18:30.629 --> 02:18:30.639 align:start position:0%
to the north country the balsam
 
02:18:34.230 --> 02:18:34.240 align:start position:0%
redevelopment project has a long history
 
02:18:36.150 --> 02:18:36.160 align:start position:0%
i mean when i first got to the council
 
02:18:38.309 --> 02:18:38.319 align:start position:0%
here in 2014
 
02:18:39.750 --> 02:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
i return a lot of these hearings
 
02:18:42.629 --> 02:18:42.639 align:start position:0%
discussing how to get funding to help
 
02:18:44.309 --> 02:18:44.319 align:start position:0%
out this project which is very important
 
02:18:45.750 --> 02:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
to the north country
 
02:18:48.709 --> 02:18:48.719 align:start position:0%
and for many years we had um
 
02:18:50.870 --> 02:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
raise the credit limit to you know to
 
02:18:54.469 --> 02:18:54.479 align:start position:0%
the bfa to allow for this project
 
02:18:56.549 --> 02:18:56.559 align:start position:0%
um you know to move forward
 
02:18:59.429 --> 02:18:59.439 align:start position:0%
unfortunately because of certain things
 
02:19:02.870 --> 02:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh the financial package uh the economy
 
02:19:05.589 --> 02:19:05.599 align:start position:0%
and the timing it just wasn't right
 
02:19:08.549 --> 02:19:08.559 align:start position:0%
the developer feels that the timing is
 
02:19:08.559 --> 02:19:09.589 align:start position:0%
the developer feels that the timing is
right

02:19:09.589 --> 02:19:09.599 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:19:11.589 --> 02:19:11.599 align:start position:0%
this year as he finishes off his
 
02:19:13.910 --> 02:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
financial package
 
02:19:16.950 --> 02:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
it's an exorbitantly expensive project
 
02:19:19.190 --> 02:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
there's no doubt about it in the golf
 
02:19:21.750 --> 02:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
links road as this amendment is uh
 
02:19:21.760 --> 02:19:23.509 align:start position:0%
links road as this amendment is uh
addressing

02:19:23.509 --> 02:19:23.519 align:start position:0%
addressing
 
02:19:26.150 --> 02:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
is um it would allow them to open up
 
02:19:27.830 --> 02:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
that part
 
02:19:30.309 --> 02:19:30.319 align:start position:0%
of this project with the the country
 
02:19:32.790 --> 02:19:32.800 align:start position:0%
club and the beautiful golf courses
 
02:19:35.509 --> 02:19:35.519 align:start position:0%
and also provide an opportunity
 
02:19:37.830 --> 02:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
to really develop that side of the
 
02:19:42.070 --> 02:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
property uh in colebrook as well
 
02:19:44.709 --> 02:19:44.719 align:start position:0%
we know that the cost of this project
 
02:19:45.990 --> 02:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
has gone up
 
02:19:48.710 --> 02:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
from the initial estimates about 2.6
 
02:19:48.720 --> 02:19:49.670 align:start position:0%
from the initial estimates about 2.6
million

02:19:49.670 --> 02:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
million
 
02:19:53.030 --> 02:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
to about 4.1 or if not more
 
02:19:55.349 --> 02:19:55.359 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately we you know it would
 
02:19:56.710 --> 02:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
have been a nice if we'd done it a few
 
02:19:59.270 --> 02:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
years ago but costs have gone up and
 
02:19:59.280 --> 02:20:00.309 align:start position:0%
years ago but costs have gone up and
therefore

02:20:00.309 --> 02:20:00.319 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
02:20:02.070 --> 02:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
uh the amendment is written the way it
 
02:20:04.309 --> 02:20:04.319 align:start position:0%
is to to reflect that
 
02:20:06.070 --> 02:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
um there's been a lot of discussions
 
02:20:06.080 --> 02:20:07.190 align:start position:0%
um there's been a lot of discussions
about

02:20:07.190 --> 02:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:20:09.670 --> 02:20:09.680 align:start position:0%
rightly so with the
 
02:20:12.630 --> 02:20:12.640 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of transportation
 
02:20:14.870 --> 02:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
and the house committee chairman that we
 
02:20:18.550 --> 02:20:18.560 align:start position:0%
cannot simply take out
 
02:20:21.190 --> 02:20:21.200 align:start position:0%
um or put in money
 
02:20:23.030 --> 02:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
i mean with regards to the 10-year
 
02:20:24.950 --> 02:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
highway improvement plan
 
02:20:28.309 --> 02:20:28.319 align:start position:0%
that money is already been programmed
 
02:20:30.230 --> 02:20:30.240 align:start position:0%
there's money that matches up with these
 
02:20:31.750 --> 02:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh projects
 
02:20:34.309 --> 02:20:34.319 align:start position:0%
for the next several years and beyond
 
02:20:36.790 --> 02:20:36.800 align:start position:0%
and and if we do put in the balsams
 
02:20:36.800 --> 02:20:37.830 align:start position:0%
and and if we do put in the balsams
project

02:20:37.830 --> 02:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
project
 
02:20:38.950 --> 02:20:38.960 align:start position:0%
you know into the 10-year highway
 
02:20:40.469 --> 02:20:40.479 align:start position:0%
improvement plan we'd have to pull
 
02:20:42.309 --> 02:20:42.319 align:start position:0%
something else out
 
02:20:45.429 --> 02:20:45.439 align:start position:0%
we've gone too far
 
02:20:46.469 --> 02:20:46.479 align:start position:0%
through the
 
02:20:49.270 --> 02:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
the gasset process the legislative
 
02:20:49.280 --> 02:20:50.469 align:start position:0%
the gasset process the legislative
process

02:20:50.469 --> 02:20:50.479 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:20:53.190 --> 02:20:53.200 align:start position:0%
to really allow that to happen
 
02:20:55.190 --> 02:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
because in my judgment
 
02:20:56.790 --> 02:20:56.800 align:start position:0%
when the regional planning commissions
 
02:20:58.469 --> 02:20:58.479 align:start position:0%
come together we have the public
 
02:21:01.110 --> 02:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
hearings all around the state
 
02:21:03.110 --> 02:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
and we've really kind of haggled and
 
02:21:04.710 --> 02:21:04.720 align:start position:0%
bargained and figured out what our
 
02:21:06.230 --> 02:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
priorities are
 
02:21:08.150 --> 02:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
that we really need to stick to them is
 
02:21:09.910 --> 02:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
as best we can throughout the
 
02:21:11.590 --> 02:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
legislative process
 
02:21:13.910 --> 02:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
and with your work and others we
 
02:21:15.750 --> 02:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
ineffectively you know have done that
 
02:21:17.349 --> 02:21:17.359 align:start position:0%
with the 10-year highway improvement
 
02:21:19.590 --> 02:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
plan i think it's a great plan it
 
02:21:22.469 --> 02:21:22.479 align:start position:0%
incorporates a lot of additional uh
 
02:21:24.070 --> 02:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
you know funding for some of our
 
02:21:26.469 --> 02:21:26.479 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that's going to go a long
 
02:21:29.910 --> 02:21:29.920 align:start position:0%
ways here in the coming years so
 
02:21:31.510 --> 02:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
leave that alone
 
02:21:33.510 --> 02:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
but what we're talking about
 
02:21:36.230 --> 02:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
is the the authorization of the the
 
02:21:39.670 --> 02:21:39.680 align:start position:0%
d.o.t commissioner to say listen
 
02:21:41.670 --> 02:21:41.680 align:start position:0%
if there are other monies that we can
 
02:21:44.630 --> 02:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
you know access within state government
 
02:21:46.630 --> 02:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
that this is a project that's going to
 
02:21:48.230 --> 02:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
have exponential
 
02:21:51.190 --> 02:21:51.200 align:start position:0%
uh benefit to the north country
 
02:21:53.030 --> 02:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
you probably heard this thing called the
 
02:21:55.830 --> 02:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
the hundred millions dollars for this uh
 
02:21:57.670 --> 02:21:57.680 align:start position:0%
housing program
 
02:21:59.910 --> 02:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
i never knew there was a hundred million
 
02:22:01.830 --> 02:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
dollars hanging out there that you know
 
02:22:04.309 --> 02:22:04.319 align:start position:0%
that we could use for housing so money
 
02:22:07.270 --> 02:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
is appearing uh quite frequently before
 
02:22:09.190 --> 02:22:09.200 align:start position:0%
the council
 
02:22:10.790 --> 02:22:10.800 align:start position:0%
we just passed
 
02:22:12.950 --> 02:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
umpteen millions of dollars for
 
02:22:15.670 --> 02:22:15.680 align:start position:0%
the fish hatchery program
 
02:22:17.670 --> 02:22:17.680 align:start position:0%
another umpteen millions they're going
 
02:22:19.670 --> 02:22:19.680 align:start position:0%
to go to potentially to the the
 
02:22:23.030 --> 02:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
hampstead hospital project so
 
02:22:24.469 --> 02:22:24.479 align:start position:0%
apparently there's a lot of money out
 
02:22:24.479 --> 02:22:25.349 align:start position:0%
apparently there's a lot of money out
there

02:22:25.349 --> 02:22:25.359 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:22:28.150 --> 02:22:28.160 align:start position:0%
but with economic development
 
02:22:30.870 --> 02:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
infrastructure is key and you can go
 
02:22:32.630 --> 02:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
right here in concord and look off of
 
02:22:34.389 --> 02:22:34.399 align:start position:0%
exit 17
 
02:22:36.790 --> 02:22:36.800 align:start position:0%
with the state um working with the city
 
02:22:39.429 --> 02:22:39.439 align:start position:0%
of concord over the redevelopment of
 
02:22:41.030 --> 02:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
exit 17 where there's going to be a
 
02:22:42.950 --> 02:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
state liquor store there's going to be a
 
02:22:44.389 --> 02:22:44.399 align:start position:0%
market basket
 
02:22:46.469 --> 02:22:46.479 align:start position:0%
that the state has put money into it to
 
02:22:48.389 --> 02:22:48.399 align:start position:0%
support that economic development and
 
02:22:50.309 --> 02:22:50.319 align:start position:0%
what we're really simply saying with the
 
02:22:52.230 --> 02:22:52.240 align:start position:0%
balsams project if there's money out
 
02:22:54.150 --> 02:22:54.160 align:start position:0%
there to support that economic
 
02:22:56.309 --> 02:22:56.319 align:start position:0%
development project that would create
 
02:22:56.319 --> 02:22:58.950 align:start position:0%
development project that would create
jobs

02:22:58.950 --> 02:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:00.950 --> 02:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely you know
 
02:23:04.550 --> 02:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
revenue and taxation for property taxes
 
02:23:06.389 --> 02:23:06.399 align:start position:0%
uh it would create a lot of activity and
 
02:23:09.349 --> 02:23:09.359 align:start position:0%
vitality uh for that area we know that
 
02:23:11.670 --> 02:23:11.680 align:start position:0%
the the rubber plant uh
 
02:23:14.630 --> 02:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
you know rubber plant has taken off
 
02:23:16.710 --> 02:23:16.720 align:start position:0%
we know like any economic development
 
02:23:19.190 --> 02:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
project we need housing we need child
 
02:23:22.070 --> 02:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
care we need in-house counseling
 
02:23:23.670 --> 02:23:23.680 align:start position:0%
and we and i think the developer
 
02:23:25.750 --> 02:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
understands that and he has ways of
 
02:23:28.790 --> 02:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
going about that to create his workforce
 
02:23:31.190 --> 02:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
and so on so so i don't want to belabor
 
02:23:33.990 --> 02:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
this but i think if we can provide them
 
02:23:36.870 --> 02:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
at least a hope or an opportunity that
 
02:23:38.630 --> 02:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
there might be some money out there to
 
02:23:41.190 --> 02:23:41.200 align:start position:0%
support this particular road project
 
02:23:42.870 --> 02:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
other than going into the 10-year
 
02:23:44.710 --> 02:23:44.720 align:start position:0%
highway improvement plan
 
02:23:46.389 --> 02:23:46.399 align:start position:0%
that the governor
 
02:23:49.110 --> 02:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
02:23:50.790 --> 02:23:50.800 align:start position:0%
into a certain degree the executive
 
02:23:50.800 --> 02:23:51.910 align:start position:0%
into a certain degree the executive
council

02:23:51.910 --> 02:23:51.920 align:start position:0%
council
 
02:23:54.550 --> 02:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
might be able to say okay
 
02:23:54.560 --> 02:23:55.429 align:start position:0%
might be able to say okay
let's

02:23:55.429 --> 02:23:55.439 align:start position:0%
let's
 
02:23:57.990 --> 02:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
you know take care of this state road
 
02:23:59.750 --> 02:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
bringing up the standards
 
02:24:01.510 --> 02:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
and pass it over
 
02:24:03.270 --> 02:24:03.280 align:start position:0%
to the developer
 
02:24:06.070 --> 02:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
uh into the county of coast because one
 
02:24:07.910 --> 02:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
thing i've learned about working with
 
02:24:09.910 --> 02:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
dot for many years
 
02:24:11.190 --> 02:24:11.200 align:start position:0%
is that
 
02:24:14.309 --> 02:24:14.319 align:start position:0%
they love relinquishing state roads to
 
02:24:15.990 --> 02:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
local communities
 
02:24:18.150 --> 02:24:18.160 align:start position:0%
and to local developers that gets them
 
02:24:19.349 --> 02:24:19.359 align:start position:0%
off the hook
 
02:24:21.429 --> 02:24:21.439 align:start position:0%
into the future so this is an
 
02:24:21.439 --> 02:24:22.710 align:start position:0%
into the future so this is an
opportunity

02:24:22.710 --> 02:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
02:24:25.030 --> 02:24:25.040 align:start position:0%
that would allow the state to bring up
 
02:24:26.710 --> 02:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
the road to standards
 
02:24:28.389 --> 02:24:28.399 align:start position:0%
and then uh relinquish their
 
02:24:28.399 --> 02:24:29.910 align:start position:0%
and then uh relinquish their
responsibility

02:24:29.910 --> 02:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
02:24:32.550 --> 02:24:32.560 align:start position:0%
um to the developer and into the local
 
02:24:34.790 --> 02:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
community i think it's it's a win-win on
 
02:24:36.150 --> 02:24:36.160 align:start position:0%
both sides i don't think there's any
 
02:24:37.990 --> 02:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
really objections to it everybody's just
 
02:24:40.230 --> 02:24:40.240 align:start position:0%
trying to how do we adhere to the law
 
02:24:42.550 --> 02:24:42.560 align:start position:0%
that was passed several years ago that
 
02:24:44.790 --> 02:24:44.800 align:start position:0%
you can't really give money to this
 
02:24:48.389 --> 02:24:48.399 align:start position:0%
redevelopment of golflinx road
 
02:24:50.309 --> 02:24:50.319 align:start position:0%
until there's a financial package in
 
02:24:50.319 --> 02:24:51.510 align:start position:0%
until there's a financial package in
place

02:24:51.510 --> 02:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
place
 
02:24:53.750 --> 02:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
and that's still going to stay in place
 
02:24:56.469 --> 02:24:56.479 align:start position:0%
even if we go out and find money you
 
02:24:58.230 --> 02:24:58.240 align:start position:0%
know to do this road
 
02:25:00.950 --> 02:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
we still have to know the developer has
 
02:25:03.030 --> 02:25:03.040 align:start position:0%
finalized their financial package and
 
02:25:04.630 --> 02:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
that indeed the development is going to
 
02:25:07.990 --> 02:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
go forward but from from all indications
 
02:25:09.670 --> 02:25:09.680 align:start position:0%
there looks like there's a bright future
 
02:25:09.680 --> 02:25:10.389 align:start position:0%
there looks like there's a bright future
here

02:25:10.389 --> 02:25:10.399 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:25:13.030 --> 02:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
in the near future so without it open up
 
02:25:15.270 --> 02:25:15.280 align:start position:0%
to any questions
 
02:25:15.280 --> 02:25:16.790 align:start position:0%
to any questions
representative

02:25:16.790 --> 02:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:25:18.389 --> 02:25:18.399 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
02:25:22.830 --> 02:25:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:26.070 --> 02:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
i i'm trying to get an executive
 
02:25:27.910 --> 02:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
overview of
 
02:25:29.830 --> 02:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
the status of the balsams project i
 
02:25:32.230 --> 02:25:32.240 align:start position:0%
remember two terms ago when i was here
 
02:25:35.429 --> 02:25:35.439 align:start position:0%
i believe we passed some uh legislation
 
02:25:37.110 --> 02:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
that allowed
 
02:25:39.030 --> 02:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
loans from the state of new hampshire to
 
02:25:41.030 --> 02:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
the project or whatever what i'm trying
 
02:25:42.870 --> 02:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
what i'm looking for is what's the
 
02:25:45.429 --> 02:25:45.439 align:start position:0%
status of the project right now
 
02:25:48.309 --> 02:25:48.319 align:start position:0%
what is the total estimated cost
 
02:25:50.630 --> 02:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
absent the road
 
02:25:52.710 --> 02:25:52.720 align:start position:0%
of the work that auten is doing on the
 
02:25:53.990 --> 02:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
project what's
 
02:25:55.429 --> 02:25:55.439 align:start position:0%
what's the total
 
02:25:57.270 --> 02:25:57.280 align:start position:0%
dollar value of this project does that
 
02:25:58.870 --> 02:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
make sense yeah no that's excellent
 
02:26:00.870 --> 02:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
question i know there there's a speaker
 
02:26:02.150 --> 02:26:02.160 align:start position:0%
too behind me that can give more
 
02:26:04.070 --> 02:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
specifics you know i can give you kind
 
02:26:06.630 --> 02:26:06.640 align:start position:0%
of generalizations i know it's so it's
 
02:26:09.270 --> 02:26:09.280 align:start position:0%
over a 200 million dollar project
 
02:26:13.190 --> 02:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
um i know that um he's working according
 
02:26:16.550 --> 02:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
to news reports with goldman sachs he's
 
02:26:18.870 --> 02:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
working with provident bank he's working
 
02:26:21.110 --> 02:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
with barclays he's working with a lot of
 
02:26:23.670 --> 02:26:23.680 align:start position:0%
financial packages he's working with the
 
02:26:27.510 --> 02:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
county uh with regards to bond issuance
 
02:26:29.670 --> 02:26:29.680 align:start position:0%
he's working um
 
02:26:29.680 --> 02:26:31.110 align:start position:0%
he's working um
with

02:26:31.110 --> 02:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:26:33.270 --> 02:26:33.280 align:start position:0%
you know private investors he's
 
02:26:36.309 --> 02:26:36.319 align:start position:0%
obviously still trying to uh market
 
02:26:39.349 --> 02:26:39.359 align:start position:0%
uh the various time shares that are
 
02:26:42.710 --> 02:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
presently on the facility so uh the
 
02:26:44.469 --> 02:26:44.479 align:start position:0%
financial package is
 
02:26:47.910 --> 02:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
is wide and long and and the key thing
 
02:26:50.070 --> 02:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
there has to be a key moment when
 
02:26:52.070 --> 02:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
everything is synchronized
 
02:26:54.389 --> 02:26:54.399 align:start position:0%
and meets up at the same time because
 
02:26:56.950 --> 02:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
remember he's a lot of is being dictated
 
02:26:58.230 --> 02:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
by the market
 
02:27:00.150 --> 02:27:00.160 align:start position:0%
so when it comes to bonds so he has to
 
02:27:02.710 --> 02:27:02.720 align:start position:0%
make sure that there's a healthy uh you
 
02:27:04.710 --> 02:27:04.720 align:start position:0%
know vibrant market for allow him to
 
02:27:06.790 --> 02:27:06.800 align:start position:0%
move forward with this project so that's
 
02:27:08.070 --> 02:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
the best i can give you and i'm not a
 
02:27:12.469 --> 02:27:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:15.030 --> 02:27:15.040 align:start position:0%
representative weiler
 
02:27:16.630 --> 02:27:16.640 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
02:27:19.590 --> 02:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
a welcome counselor welcome thank you
 
02:27:21.349 --> 02:27:21.359 align:start position:0%
i get the impression that this golf
 
02:27:23.910 --> 02:27:23.920 align:start position:0%
course is a going concern now
 
02:27:26.790 --> 02:27:26.800 align:start position:0%
how is it accessed now
 
02:27:29.190 --> 02:27:29.200 align:start position:0%
well if you go
 
02:27:31.110 --> 02:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
uh to the front entrance of dixville
 
02:27:33.830 --> 02:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
notch to the balsams you'll see a a long
 
02:27:36.309 --> 02:27:36.319 align:start position:0%
gate and you're not authorized to go
 
02:27:38.630 --> 02:27:38.640 align:start position:0%
through that gate however if you do go
 
02:27:41.910 --> 02:27:41.920 align:start position:0%
through that gate you'll come to a road
 
02:27:43.990 --> 02:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
further down that that kind of small
 
02:27:47.030 --> 02:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
entrance road and you will see remnants
 
02:27:47.040 --> 02:27:47.750 align:start position:0%
entrance road and you will see remnants
of

02:27:47.750 --> 02:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:27:49.590 --> 02:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
of the road which i don't know it's a
 
02:27:51.190 --> 02:27:51.200 align:start position:0%
mile and a half two miles that heads
 
02:27:53.349 --> 02:27:53.359 align:start position:0%
towards the golf course area of the
 
02:27:54.950 --> 02:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
country club
 
02:27:56.150 --> 02:27:56.160 align:start position:0%
it is
 
02:27:59.750 --> 02:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
a beat up old road that needs a
 
02:28:01.910 --> 02:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
major improvement if you're gonna have
 
02:28:04.309 --> 02:28:04.319 align:start position:0%
the the access from the public to going
 
02:28:05.670 --> 02:28:05.680 align:start position:0%
there and back
 
02:28:08.150 --> 02:28:08.160 align:start position:0%
and so it's you know it's got a lot of
 
02:28:10.070 --> 02:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
improvements even if you get the
 
02:28:12.309 --> 02:28:12.319 align:start position:0%
financing today for this you know
 
02:28:14.550 --> 02:28:14.560 align:start position:0%
golflinx road you're still going to have
 
02:28:16.950 --> 02:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
to design engineer it you're going to
 
02:28:18.630 --> 02:28:18.640 align:start position:0%
have to make sure that you know it's
 
02:28:18.640 --> 02:28:20.230 align:start position:0%
have to make sure that you know it's
permitted

02:28:20.230 --> 02:28:20.240 align:start position:0%
permitted
 
02:28:22.070 --> 02:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of wheels
 
02:28:24.309 --> 02:28:24.319 align:start position:0%
of planning designing and engineering
 
02:28:26.389 --> 02:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
that have to occur before you're gonna
 
02:28:28.309 --> 02:28:28.319 align:start position:0%
you know immediately work on that road
 
02:28:30.950 --> 02:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
so um my judgment of course the
 
02:28:32.469 --> 02:28:32.479 align:start position:0%
developer probably doesn't want to hear
 
02:28:34.630 --> 02:28:34.640 align:start position:0%
it for me but i think
 
02:28:36.389 --> 02:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
the first year you get to financing the
 
02:28:38.309 --> 02:28:38.319 align:start position:0%
second year to do the project
 
02:28:40.870 --> 02:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
when it comes to this golf links road
 
02:28:43.670 --> 02:28:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:45.349 --> 02:28:45.359 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions that
 
02:28:49.750 --> 02:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:52.230 --> 02:28:52.240 align:start position:0%
you want to follow up
 
02:28:55.349 --> 02:28:55.359 align:start position:0%
yes man i'm sure okay good
 
02:28:56.309 --> 02:28:56.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:28:58.150 --> 02:28:58.160 align:start position:0%
um and again if you don't if there's
 
02:28:59.349 --> 02:28:59.359 align:start position:0%
somebody else that can answer the
 
02:29:01.910 --> 02:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
question better that's fine too but
 
02:29:03.830 --> 02:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
what is the actual stage of the
 
02:29:06.070 --> 02:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
construction of the project now am i
 
02:29:07.590 --> 02:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
assuming there has
 
02:29:09.830 --> 02:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
to this time this date there is really
 
02:29:12.150 --> 02:29:12.160 align:start position:0%
no financing lined up at all have they
 
02:29:15.590 --> 02:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
started what is this status of sure i
 
02:29:17.510 --> 02:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
think the value in the project right now
 
02:29:20.070 --> 02:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
is that all the permitting has been done
 
02:29:21.910 --> 02:29:21.920 align:start position:0%
uh the permitting has been going on for
 
02:29:23.590 --> 02:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
years and a lot of the permitting has
 
02:29:25.030 --> 02:29:25.040 align:start position:0%
been renewed
 
02:29:27.190 --> 02:29:27.200 align:start position:0%
um and you know from the water
 
02:29:29.670 --> 02:29:29.680 align:start position:0%
withdrawal permitting to
 
02:29:31.990 --> 02:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
you know some of the dredging you know
 
02:29:34.790 --> 02:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
uh permitting uh um obviously working
 
02:29:37.349 --> 02:29:37.359 align:start position:0%
with the cost planning board
 
02:29:39.349 --> 02:29:39.359 align:start position:0%
all the permits um
 
02:29:41.510 --> 02:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
that i'm aware of are really in place
 
02:29:43.030 --> 02:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
and that's where all the money and value
 
02:29:45.030 --> 02:29:45.040 align:start position:0%
has been put into the project up to this
 
02:29:45.040 --> 02:29:45.910 align:start position:0%
has been put into the project up to this
point

02:29:45.910 --> 02:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
point
 
02:29:47.990 --> 02:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
um they're i think they're
 
02:29:49.750 --> 02:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
probably um
 
02:29:51.990 --> 02:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
been some upkeep there's been some
 
02:29:53.910 --> 02:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
development of certain parts of the
 
02:29:56.950 --> 02:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
project to showcase um what their units
 
02:29:59.030 --> 02:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
are going to look like in the future
 
02:30:01.429 --> 02:30:01.439 align:start position:0%
um so there has been a lot of energy and
 
02:30:02.950 --> 02:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
time expended
 
02:30:05.990 --> 02:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
um on the sales of trying to you know
 
02:30:08.870 --> 02:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
get investors committed uh to time
 
02:30:10.870 --> 02:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
shares and and whatnot
 
02:30:13.510 --> 02:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
um so um you know if you talk to the
 
02:30:15.670 --> 02:30:15.680 align:start position:0%
developer you know he'll say he's put
 
02:30:16.870 --> 02:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
personally seven or eight million
 
02:30:19.110 --> 02:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
dollars into it um so when you when
 
02:30:20.630 --> 02:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
you're talking about the development
 
02:30:22.230 --> 02:30:22.240 align:start position:0%
side of it a lot of it's been the
 
02:30:23.990 --> 02:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
permitting the planning
 
02:30:27.349 --> 02:30:27.359 align:start position:0%
and um obviously um the overall
 
02:30:29.830 --> 02:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
uh concept of the project
 
02:30:32.389 --> 02:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
and then obviously uh working to get um
 
02:30:34.150 --> 02:30:34.160 align:start position:0%
sales and investors involved in the
 
02:30:34.160 --> 02:30:38.309 align:start position:0%
sales and investors involved in the
project

02:30:38.309 --> 02:30:38.319 align:start position:0%

and uh
is

02:31:32.630 --> 02:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:31:35.429 --> 02:31:35.439 align:start position:0%
most more up-to-date than i am
 
02:31:37.750 --> 02:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
on exactly where
 
02:31:37.760 --> 02:31:38.870 align:start position:0%
on exactly where
the

02:31:38.870 --> 02:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:31:42.309 --> 02:31:42.319 align:start position:0%
work has gone on the financing package
 
02:31:43.510 --> 02:31:43.520 align:start position:0%
that the
 
02:31:43.520 --> 02:31:44.950 align:start position:0%
that the
developer

02:31:44.950 --> 02:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
developer
 
02:31:47.429 --> 02:31:47.439 align:start position:0%
is close to putting together
 
02:31:49.990 --> 02:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
there are always obstacles
 
02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:51.349 align:start position:0%
there are always obstacles
but

02:31:51.349 --> 02:31:51.359 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:31:53.750 --> 02:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
as i said at a previous hearing i almost
 
02:31:55.270 --> 02:31:55.280 align:start position:0%
can hear the hammer
 
02:31:59.110 --> 02:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:01.910 --> 02:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
this is a very important road as you
 
02:32:04.230 --> 02:32:04.240 align:start position:0%
heard a state road
 
02:32:07.030 --> 02:32:07.040 align:start position:0%
that has been allowed to deteriorate
 
02:32:08.830 --> 02:32:08.840 align:start position:0%
over the years
 
02:32:12.469 --> 02:32:12.479 align:start position:0%
because the resort was not open
 
02:32:15.270 --> 02:32:15.280 align:start position:0%
and the state had to make choices it was
 
02:32:18.230 --> 02:32:18.240 align:start position:0%
on the 10-year plan it also was
 
02:32:20.870 --> 02:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
contingent on getting financing
 
02:32:22.790 --> 02:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
in the past
 
02:32:24.950 --> 02:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
that didn't happen it just now appears
 
02:32:27.510 --> 02:32:27.520 align:start position:0%
that we're are quite close to having
 
02:32:28.710 --> 02:32:28.720 align:start position:0%
that happen
 
02:32:31.349 --> 02:32:31.359 align:start position:0%
this road runs from
 
02:32:34.550 --> 02:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
the main buildings of the ball what was
 
02:32:36.790 --> 02:32:36.800 align:start position:0%
the balsams resort
 
02:32:39.190 --> 02:32:39.200 align:start position:0%
uh that mr tillotson owned
 
02:32:42.950 --> 02:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
and up to a couple of miles up to
 
02:32:45.030 --> 02:32:45.040 align:start position:0%
the town of colebrook
 
02:32:45.040 --> 02:32:46.309 align:start position:0%
the town of colebrook
where

02:32:46.309 --> 02:32:46.319 align:start position:0%
where
 
02:32:48.870 --> 02:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
the so-called country club which is a
 
02:32:51.750 --> 02:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
lovely facility with a
 
02:32:54.630 --> 02:32:54.640 align:start position:0%
view towards canada vermont new
 
02:32:55.830 --> 02:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire as
 
02:32:57.830 --> 02:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
john harrigan used to say got to see two
 
02:33:00.630 --> 02:33:00.640 align:start position:0%
foreign countries
 
02:33:04.710 --> 02:33:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:06.710 --> 02:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:33:08.950 --> 02:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
it's a donald ross course that has been
 
02:33:08.960 --> 02:33:10.630 align:start position:0%
it's a donald ross course that has been
maintained

02:33:10.630 --> 02:33:10.640 align:start position:0%
maintained
 
02:33:11.670 --> 02:33:11.680 align:start position:0%
but it's
 
02:33:14.309 --> 02:33:14.319 align:start position:0%
essential to the hotel that there be
 
02:33:16.070 --> 02:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
good access
 
02:33:17.510 --> 02:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
to this
 
02:33:17.520 --> 02:33:18.469 align:start position:0%
to this

02:33:24.950 --> 02:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
it also
 
02:33:27.830 --> 02:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
under the plans that have been developed
 
02:33:30.389 --> 02:33:30.399 align:start position:0%
would include housing
 
02:33:32.309 --> 02:33:32.319 align:start position:0%
that would be actually in the town of
 
02:33:34.790 --> 02:33:34.800 align:start position:0%
colbrook and produce property tax
 
02:33:38.389 --> 02:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
dollars for the town of colebrook
 
02:33:40.630 --> 02:33:40.640 align:start position:0%
dixville is an unincorporated place and
 
02:33:42.550 --> 02:33:42.560 align:start position:0%

county on how taxes are collected
 
02:33:49.830 --> 02:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
but i'm here really from coast five
 
02:33:49.840 --> 02:33:51.190 align:start position:0%
but i'm here really from coast five
because

02:33:51.190 --> 02:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:33:53.990 --> 02:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
all of coast
 
02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:55.349 align:start position:0%
all of coast
regrets

02:33:55.349 --> 02:33:55.359 align:start position:0%
regrets
 
02:33:57.750 --> 02:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
the loss of the business
 
02:33:59.590 --> 02:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
at the balsams hotel
 
02:34:02.550 --> 02:34:02.560 align:start position:0%
we're losing population
 
02:34:04.870 --> 02:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
i will lose my seat i no longer will
 
02:34:06.550 --> 02:34:06.560 align:start position:0%
have a district
 
02:34:09.510 --> 02:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to go from 10 reps down to 9
 
02:34:11.750 --> 02:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
which of course i regret
 
02:34:14.710 --> 02:34:14.720 align:start position:0%
but it's an ongoing problem that we
 
02:34:16.710 --> 02:34:16.720 align:start position:0%
don't have
 
02:34:19.510 --> 02:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
substantial industries on the whole
 
02:34:21.030 --> 02:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
being developed
 
02:34:21.040 --> 02:34:21.830 align:start position:0%
being developed
in

02:34:21.830 --> 02:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:34:23.349 --> 02:34:23.359 align:start position:0%
coast county
 
02:34:23.359 --> 02:34:24.630 align:start position:0%
coast county
this

02:34:24.630 --> 02:34:24.640 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:34:27.990 --> 02:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
road project is part of
 
02:34:31.110 --> 02:34:31.120 align:start position:0%
what would be a very large
 
02:34:31.120 --> 02:34:32.950 align:start position:0%
what would be a very large
project

02:34:32.950 --> 02:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
project
 
02:34:34.630 --> 02:34:34.640 align:start position:0%
commissioner gorman
 
02:34:37.110 --> 02:34:37.120 align:start position:0%
will fill you in on the numbers but i
 
02:34:38.550 --> 02:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
assure you that
 
02:34:38.560 --> 02:34:39.830 align:start position:0%
assure you that
the

02:34:39.830 --> 02:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:34:42.469 --> 02:34:42.479 align:start position:0%
lack of a big
 
02:34:46.230 --> 02:34:46.240 align:start position:0%
amount of activity in that corner of
 
02:34:49.110 --> 02:34:49.120 align:start position:0%
koas has had devastating effects
 
02:34:50.870 --> 02:34:50.880 align:start position:0%
on pittsburgh
 
02:34:52.550 --> 02:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
on colebrook
 
02:34:56.710 --> 02:34:56.720 align:start position:0%
on berlin on almost all parts of coast
 
02:34:59.110 --> 02:34:59.120 align:start position:0%
the southern little tear if you think of
 
02:35:01.590 --> 02:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
it as a crescent
 
02:35:04.070 --> 02:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
is has not been as affected but i would
 
02:35:06.870 --> 02:35:06.880 align:start position:0%
say two-thirds of the county has been
 
02:35:08.950 --> 02:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
adversely affected
 
02:35:08.960 --> 02:35:10.469 align:start position:0%
adversely affected
by

02:35:10.469 --> 02:35:10.479 align:start position:0%
by
 
02:35:13.510 --> 02:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
the closing of the balsams resort
 
02:35:17.190 --> 02:35:17.200 align:start position:0%
so the idea that we could be so close to
 
02:35:19.110 --> 02:35:19.120 align:start position:0%
having this happen
 
02:35:21.750 --> 02:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
and this road being an important part
 
02:35:23.429 --> 02:35:23.439 align:start position:0%
makes me thank
 
02:35:23.439 --> 02:35:25.270 align:start position:0%
makes me thank
uh

02:35:25.270 --> 02:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:35:27.510 --> 02:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
executive councilor kenny
 
02:35:29.590 --> 02:35:29.600 align:start position:0%
representative to bears and others for
 
02:35:32.070 --> 02:35:32.080 align:start position:0%
working to see a way
 
02:35:34.790 --> 02:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
that we have a plan that is contingent
 
02:35:38.469 --> 02:35:38.479 align:start position:0%
on the financing going forward
 
02:35:41.910 --> 02:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
that would then make it possible for
 
02:35:44.950 --> 02:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
monies to be found in other locations
 
02:35:44.960 --> 02:35:46.389 align:start position:0%
monies to be found in other locations
uh

02:35:46.389 --> 02:35:46.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:35:48.550 --> 02:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
not from the 10-year plan
 
02:35:50.230 --> 02:35:50.240 align:start position:0%
to affect
 
02:35:50.240 --> 02:35:51.110 align:start position:0%
to affect
this

02:35:51.110 --> 02:35:51.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:35:52.710 --> 02:35:52.720 align:start position:0%
repair and
 
02:35:55.349 --> 02:35:55.359 align:start position:0%
redoing of that important road
 
02:35:55.359 --> 02:35:56.389 align:start position:0%
redoing of that important road
so

02:35:56.389 --> 02:35:56.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:35:58.550 --> 02:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
i'm here really as someone speaking on
 
02:36:00.550 --> 02:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
behalf of the whole county
 
02:36:01.750 --> 02:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
now i'm going to turn over the
 
02:36:02.980 --> 02:36:02.990 align:start position:0%
microphone to
 
02:36:02.990 --> 02:36:04.550 align:start position:0%
microphone to
[Music]

02:36:04.550 --> 02:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:36:06.550 --> 02:36:06.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner gorman
 
02:36:06.560 --> 02:36:07.750 align:start position:0%
commissioner gorman
and

02:36:07.750 --> 02:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:36:12.150 --> 02:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:13.510 --> 02:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
i really want to thank you folks for
 
02:36:15.670 --> 02:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
giving me the opportunity to to speak on
 
02:36:18.630 --> 02:36:18.640 align:start position:0%
this project which means so much to our
 
02:36:19.910 --> 02:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
whole county
 
02:36:21.990 --> 02:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
especially the community of colebrook so
 
02:36:23.110 --> 02:36:23.120 align:start position:0%
i'm going to start from the beginning
 
02:36:24.790 --> 02:36:24.800 align:start position:0%
because one of the first questions was
 
02:36:27.030 --> 02:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
what is golf links road
 
02:36:27.040 --> 02:36:27.990 align:start position:0%
what is golf links road
and

02:36:27.990 --> 02:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:36:30.150 --> 02:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
golf links road goes directly from the
 
02:36:32.230 --> 02:36:32.240 align:start position:0%
hotel to the golf course
 
02:36:35.670 --> 02:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
it is an extreme it is very scenic all
 
02:36:38.070 --> 02:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
right that whole area we keep talking
 
02:36:40.550 --> 02:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
about the four states the two countries
 
02:36:42.870 --> 02:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
it's really scenic okay
 
02:36:45.429 --> 02:36:45.439 align:start position:0%
and so as you drive up the road you go
 
02:36:47.349 --> 02:36:47.359 align:start position:0%
approximately let's say a house let's
 
02:36:49.590 --> 02:36:49.600 align:start position:0%
call it half a mile up golf links road
 
02:36:51.429 --> 02:36:51.439 align:start position:0%
there's a little pond it's called two
 
02:36:53.590 --> 02:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
town pond the reason it's called two
 
02:36:55.510 --> 02:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
town pond is that's the town line of
 
02:36:57.750 --> 02:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
colebrook and dixville
 
02:37:00.870 --> 02:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
so the rest of the road is in coburg
 
02:37:00.880 --> 02:37:01.750 align:start position:0%
so the rest of the road is in coburg
okay

02:37:01.750 --> 02:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:37:04.309 --> 02:37:04.319 align:start position:0%
leading to the golf course all right so
 
02:37:06.389 --> 02:37:06.399 align:start position:0%
this road if it is
 
02:37:08.230 --> 02:37:08.240 align:start position:0%
fixed up
 
02:37:08.240 --> 02:37:09.190 align:start position:0%
fixed up
and

02:37:09.190 --> 02:37:09.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:37:12.070 --> 02:37:12.080 align:start position:0%
made would also be an opportunity for
 
02:37:14.389 --> 02:37:14.399 align:start position:0%
real estate sales
 
02:37:15.429 --> 02:37:15.439 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:37:17.349 --> 02:37:17.359 align:start position:0%
and then you get to the golf course
 
02:37:19.110 --> 02:37:19.120 align:start position:0%
which is now two miles away it's a
 
02:37:21.510 --> 02:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
wonderful clubhouse we used to hold
 
02:37:24.230 --> 02:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
weddings uh convention parties we used
 
02:37:27.030 --> 02:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
to do a pile of work there and
 
02:37:28.389 --> 02:37:28.399 align:start position:0%
um i probably should back up a little
 
02:37:30.630 --> 02:37:30.640 align:start position:0%
bit i've worked at the balsams for 32
 
02:37:33.110 --> 02:37:33.120 align:start position:0%
years all right i'm a lifelong resident
 
02:37:34.870 --> 02:37:34.880 align:start position:0%
of the north country selectmen for
 
02:37:37.349 --> 02:37:37.359 align:start position:0%
coldbrook and the county commissioner
 
02:37:39.030 --> 02:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
and so this road
 
02:37:40.870 --> 02:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
it goes up to the golf course this
 
02:37:43.510 --> 02:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
incredible stone building uh with this
 
02:37:45.349 --> 02:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
patio that looks out over the golf
 
02:37:47.030 --> 02:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
course and into the
 
02:37:48.790 --> 02:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
other states and so on and so forth so
 
02:37:49.910 --> 02:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
it really is
 
02:37:53.270 --> 02:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for the county and for
 
02:37:55.190 --> 02:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
colebrook also with this golf course and
 
02:37:57.429 --> 02:37:57.439 align:start position:0%
it's a donald ross course
 
02:37:59.670 --> 02:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
and it's one of those older courses that
 
02:37:59.680 --> 02:38:00.630 align:start position:0%
and it's one of those older courses that
people

02:38:00.630 --> 02:38:00.640 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:38:02.469 --> 02:38:02.479 align:start position:0%
travel around the country in the world
 
02:38:04.950 --> 02:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
to play these courses all right it's a
 
02:38:06.469 --> 02:38:06.479 align:start position:0%
tough course
 
02:38:08.469 --> 02:38:08.479 align:start position:0%
you gotta you need a golf cart it's up
 
02:38:10.469 --> 02:38:10.479 align:start position:0%
the hills down the hills but it's a very
 
02:38:12.630 --> 02:38:12.640 align:start position:0%
special golf course and they have kept
 
02:38:14.389 --> 02:38:14.399 align:start position:0%
the golf course
 
02:38:16.150 --> 02:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
very few people have used it but they've
 
02:38:17.750 --> 02:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
kept all the greens and they've kept a
 
02:38:19.670 --> 02:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
crew of five men working on that golf
 
02:38:21.429 --> 02:38:21.439 align:start position:0%
course ever since the hotel has been
 
02:38:22.950 --> 02:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
closed for 10 years
 
02:38:24.710 --> 02:38:24.720 align:start position:0%
realizing the importance of this golf
 
02:38:24.720 --> 02:38:25.750 align:start position:0%
realizing the importance of this golf
course

02:38:25.750 --> 02:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
course
 
02:38:28.389 --> 02:38:28.399 align:start position:0%
and part of the for colebrook in the
 
02:38:28.399 --> 02:38:29.429 align:start position:0%
and part of the for colebrook in the
county

02:38:29.429 --> 02:38:29.439 align:start position:0%
county
 
02:38:33.590 --> 02:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
the ability that mr ahn is talking about
 
02:38:36.230 --> 02:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
30 to 50 million in development of
 
02:38:39.349 --> 02:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
second homes as we like to call them on
 
02:38:41.510 --> 02:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
around the golf course on this road so
 
02:38:42.630 --> 02:38:42.640 align:start position:0%
on and so forth
 
02:38:44.550 --> 02:38:44.560 align:start position:0%
so you can just imagine for a town like
 
02:38:44.560 --> 02:38:45.590 align:start position:0%
so you can just imagine for a town like
colebrook

02:38:45.590 --> 02:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
colebrook
 
02:38:47.030 --> 02:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
to have those type of homes there's
 
02:38:48.230 --> 02:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
probably not going to be a lot of
 
02:38:51.270 --> 02:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
students so on and so forth so it would
 
02:38:53.429 --> 02:38:53.439 align:start position:0%
really for a town that is depressed as
 
02:38:54.630 --> 02:38:54.640 align:start position:0%
we are
 
02:38:56.230 --> 02:38:56.240 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of hope right now between
 
02:38:58.710 --> 02:38:58.720 align:start position:0%
the balsams and app the rubber company
 
02:39:01.190 --> 02:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
that the council referred to that our
 
02:39:02.710 --> 02:39:02.720 align:start position:0%
community could really start growing
 
02:39:05.349 --> 02:39:05.359 align:start position:0%
again after significant losses
 
02:39:06.790 --> 02:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
in our area through the years with
 
02:39:10.150 --> 02:39:10.160 align:start position:0%
wausau the paper mill working in growth
 
02:39:12.150 --> 02:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
and that left my my brother lost his job
 
02:39:14.150 --> 02:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
there ethan allen going down from five
 
02:39:16.550 --> 02:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
to 600 people to 100 people i believe
 
02:39:19.190 --> 02:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
it's on the 80 now um
 
02:39:21.429 --> 02:39:21.439 align:start position:0%
you know just the in the all of the
 
02:39:23.990 --> 02:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
balsams closing and and the tillerson
 
02:39:26.389 --> 02:39:26.399 align:start position:0%
going down we've taken some significant
 
02:39:29.030 --> 02:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
hits in the last 10 years our population
 
02:39:32.150 --> 02:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
has dropped valuations of our community
 
02:39:33.429 --> 02:39:33.439 align:start position:0%
but we're on a
 
02:39:35.110 --> 02:39:35.120 align:start position:0%
we're on a roll we're gonna we're coming
 
02:39:37.750 --> 02:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
back the balsams is going to happen app
 
02:39:40.230 --> 02:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
is providing over 100 job stores
 
02:39:42.950 --> 02:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
so but the golf links road
 
02:39:45.429 --> 02:39:45.439 align:start position:0%
it's a real opportunity
 
02:39:45.439 --> 02:39:46.710 align:start position:0%
it's a real opportunity
for

02:39:46.710 --> 02:39:46.720 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:39:48.710 --> 02:39:48.720 align:start position:0%
you know and you think talk about ice
 
02:39:50.630 --> 02:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
talking about colebrook in the county
 
02:39:52.550 --> 02:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
but even you guys can look at it as
 
02:39:54.389 --> 02:39:54.399 align:start position:0%
rooms and meals tax things like that if
 
02:39:55.110 --> 02:39:55.120 align:start position:0%
you know that's going to be
 
02:39:58.070 --> 02:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
multi-million the amount of jobs they're
 
02:40:01.429 --> 02:40:01.439 align:start position:0%
talking about uh a 400 room hotel in
 
02:40:01.439 --> 02:40:03.270 align:start position:0%
talking about uh a 400 room hotel in
dixville

02:40:03.270 --> 02:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
dixville
 
02:40:05.030 --> 02:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
02:40:07.830 --> 02:40:07.840 align:start position:0%
you know i think it's approximately 200
 
02:40:07.840 --> 02:40:08.790 align:start position:0%
you know i think it's approximately 200
million

02:40:08.790 --> 02:40:08.800 align:start position:0%
million
 
02:40:09.830 --> 02:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
that is
 
02:40:11.429 --> 02:40:11.439 align:start position:0%
working with the
 
02:40:14.469 --> 02:40:14.479 align:start position:0%
goldman and sash and provident group
 
02:40:16.550 --> 02:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
and the private investors that that mr
 
02:40:19.349 --> 02:40:19.359 align:start position:0%
auten has lined up as well
 
02:40:20.950 --> 02:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
on the county level as a county
 
02:40:23.750 --> 02:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner i can speak we have 30
 
02:40:26.150 --> 02:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
million dollars worth of bonds that we
 
02:40:28.630 --> 02:40:28.640 align:start position:0%
have worked with the legislative bodies
 
02:40:30.950 --> 02:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
to get the uh unincorporated towns like
 
02:40:33.030 --> 02:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
in the county so that we can do this
 
02:40:33.040 --> 02:40:34.389 align:start position:0%
in the county so that we can do this
bond

02:40:34.389 --> 02:40:34.399 align:start position:0%
bond
 
02:40:36.790 --> 02:40:36.800 align:start position:0%
with the developer with mr haughton
 
02:40:39.349 --> 02:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
and we are full-fledged ahead our
 
02:40:40.550 --> 02:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
attorneys are working with their
 
02:40:43.030 --> 02:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
attorneys we just added another advisor
 
02:40:44.469 --> 02:40:44.479 align:start position:0%
three weeks ago
 
02:40:45.990 --> 02:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
and were
 
02:40:48.550 --> 02:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
were full-fledged to had full support
 
02:40:50.790 --> 02:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
on the county commissioner level all
 
02:40:53.349 --> 02:40:53.359 align:start position:0%
right and the ability that we have to
 
02:40:56.230 --> 02:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
support this project all right
 
02:40:57.910 --> 02:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
uh the town of kolberg has also worked
 
02:40:59.670 --> 02:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
on our section of gulf links road with
 
02:41:02.710 --> 02:41:02.720 align:start position:0%
mr arton to to do what he needs there to
 
02:41:04.630 --> 02:41:04.640 align:start position:0%
develop his project
 
02:41:07.670 --> 02:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
all right so there's a real
 
02:41:10.710 --> 02:41:10.720 align:start position:0%
importance here that you can see that
 
02:41:13.349 --> 02:41:13.359 align:start position:0%
the communities support this and the
 
02:41:17.590 --> 02:41:17.600 align:start position:0%
ability to add these jobs to add the the
 
02:41:18.950 --> 02:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
real estate
 
02:41:19.990 --> 02:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
the whole
 
02:41:21.510 --> 02:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
package that comes with something of
 
02:41:23.830 --> 02:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
this size is significant to our
 
02:41:26.710 --> 02:41:26.720 align:start position:0%
community very significant
 
02:41:28.630 --> 02:41:28.640 align:start position:0%
i have been part of a process where we
 
02:41:30.710 --> 02:41:30.720 align:start position:0%
met with commissioner xian
 
02:41:34.550 --> 02:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
uh mr cass and the the d.o.t folks they
 
02:41:36.469 --> 02:41:36.479 align:start position:0%
they have been supportive of us all the
 
02:41:39.190 --> 02:41:39.200 align:start position:0%
way through but this is complex
 
02:41:41.510 --> 02:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
okay we get the unincorporated we got
 
02:41:44.070 --> 02:41:44.080 align:start position:0%
the 10-year plan so on and so forth in
 
02:41:47.190 --> 02:41:47.200 align:start position:0%
at that point uh the commissioner
 
02:41:48.790 --> 02:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
sheehan was speaking about betterment
 
02:41:51.030 --> 02:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
funds but now i think that's all
 
02:41:53.590 --> 02:41:53.600 align:start position:0%
all your monies right now are tied up on
 
02:41:55.910 --> 02:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
your future projects immediately so
 
02:41:57.830 --> 02:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
that's why this has kind of gone to a
 
02:41:59.670 --> 02:41:59.680 align:start position:0%
like a back burner
 
02:42:03.030 --> 02:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
but now the back burner is on okay
 
02:42:05.750 --> 02:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
the process is in full
 
02:42:05.760 --> 02:42:06.630 align:start position:0%
the process is in full
tilt

02:42:06.630 --> 02:42:06.640 align:start position:0%
tilt
 
02:42:07.990 --> 02:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
move forward
 
02:42:10.469 --> 02:42:10.479 align:start position:0%
hopefully get a shovel in the ground
 
02:42:12.230 --> 02:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
at least within the next year if not
 
02:42:13.990 --> 02:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
late this summer or fall
 
02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:15.269 align:start position:0%
late this summer or fall
um

02:42:15.269 --> 02:42:15.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:42:16.790 --> 02:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:42:18.150 --> 02:42:18.160 align:start position:0%
i'm more than welcome to take any
 
02:42:20.230 --> 02:42:20.240 align:start position:0%
questions i can go on i will speak on
 
02:42:22.230 --> 02:42:22.240 align:start position:0%
this for half an hour but you folks
 
02:42:24.070 --> 02:42:24.080 align:start position:0%
you've heard enough of me i feel already
 
02:42:27.269 --> 02:42:27.279 align:start position:0%
but i welcome any questions uh and i can
 
02:42:28.150 --> 02:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
tell you
 
02:42:30.070 --> 02:42:30.080 align:start position:0%
i'm passionate about this and i can tell
 
02:42:32.389 --> 02:42:32.399 align:start position:0%
you my north country folks a large
 
02:42:34.790 --> 02:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
percentage of them are also i mean this
 
02:42:37.030 --> 02:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
is hope for us you know this is a real
 
02:42:38.870 --> 02:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
big thing you know my kids learned to
 
02:42:41.269 --> 02:42:41.279 align:start position:0%
ski there you know i had as many as
 
02:42:43.190 --> 02:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
seven members of my family working at
 
02:42:44.710 --> 02:42:44.720 align:start position:0%
the hotel at the time
 
02:42:47.429 --> 02:42:47.439 align:start position:0%
it means the balsams was such a special
 
02:42:50.309 --> 02:42:50.319 align:start position:0%
place and if we can get that going again
 
02:42:53.030 --> 02:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
where our kids have decent jobs where i
 
02:42:54.150 --> 02:42:54.160 align:start position:0%
don't know how many of my people that
 
02:42:56.389 --> 02:42:56.399 align:start position:0%
are my age 60s and 70s that want a
 
02:42:58.630 --> 02:42:58.640 align:start position:0%
part-time job at the balls it could mean
 
02:43:00.389 --> 02:43:00.399 align:start position:0%
so much to us
 
02:43:03.750 --> 02:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for mr gorham
 
02:43:06.830 --> 02:43:06.840 align:start position:0%
yes representative thank you madam chair
 
02:43:09.910 --> 02:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
um looking at the the actual map of the
 
02:43:12.389 --> 02:43:12.399 align:start position:0%
road um
 
02:43:14.469 --> 02:43:14.479 align:start position:0%
is it safe to assume at this time there
 
02:43:16.389 --> 02:43:16.399 align:start position:0%
is no
 
02:43:19.190 --> 02:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
anything else other than at the end
 
02:43:20.630 --> 02:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
being the golf course in other words
 
02:43:22.550 --> 02:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
there's no residential development no
 
02:43:24.309 --> 02:43:24.319 align:start position:0%
houses or anything there right now no
 
02:43:26.469 --> 02:43:26.479 align:start position:0%
there isn't and and i mean it's you know
 
02:43:28.710 --> 02:43:28.720 align:start position:0%
you got boulders aside as these tables
 
02:43:30.150 --> 02:43:30.160 align:start position:0%
you know on the sides of the roads it's
 
02:43:32.070 --> 02:43:32.080 align:start position:0%
it's mountain it's in there but
 
02:43:34.389 --> 02:43:34.399 align:start position:0%
in today's world it can happen easily
 
02:43:36.469 --> 02:43:36.479 align:start position:0%
um the road i would say
 
02:43:38.710 --> 02:43:38.720 align:start position:0%
as far as use is right right now like
 
02:43:40.870 --> 02:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
this winter there's so much trail that
 
02:43:43.030 --> 02:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
goes through there all right and there's
 
02:43:45.830 --> 02:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
other little roads that go off to um the
 
02:43:50.230 --> 02:43:50.240 align:start position:0%
ponds all right nathan pond you know um
 
02:43:50.240 --> 02:43:51.670 align:start position:0%
ponds all right nathan pond you know um
and

02:43:51.670 --> 02:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:43:54.389 --> 02:43:54.399 align:start position:0%
the road itself when the resort is open
 
02:43:54.399 --> 02:43:55.670 align:start position:0%
the road itself when the resort is open
there's

02:43:55.670 --> 02:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
there's
 
02:43:58.150 --> 02:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
50 miles across country trails
 
02:43:59.990 --> 02:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
all right and you know there's a lot
 
02:44:02.389 --> 02:44:02.399 align:start position:0%
that can be developed as far as you know
 
02:44:04.469 --> 02:44:04.479 align:start position:0%
outdoors activities and stuff like that
 
02:44:06.309 --> 02:44:06.319 align:start position:0%
it would be used
 
02:44:08.550 --> 02:44:08.560 align:start position:0%
a lot it would be
 
02:44:11.030 --> 02:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
does that answer the question
 
02:44:14.710 --> 02:44:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:17.510 --> 02:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
02:44:20.389 --> 02:44:20.399 align:start position:0%
i just have one quick question that i'm
 
02:44:22.389 --> 02:44:22.399 align:start position:0%
not sure that i understood
 
02:44:25.429 --> 02:44:25.439 align:start position:0%
does golf links road go all the way out
 
02:44:28.150 --> 02:44:28.160 align:start position:0%
to a road in colebrook
 
02:44:30.710 --> 02:44:30.720 align:start position:0%
okay so you get the golf links road and
 
02:44:32.710 --> 02:44:32.720 align:start position:0%
just before the golf course let's say
 
02:44:36.309 --> 02:44:36.319 align:start position:0%
500 yards there's a broke it continues
 
02:44:38.309 --> 02:44:38.319 align:start position:0%
it becomes a dirt road and goes into
 
02:44:38.319 --> 02:44:39.349 align:start position:0%
it becomes a dirt road and goes into
cobourg

02:44:39.349 --> 02:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
cobourg
 
02:44:41.910 --> 02:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
all right goes it goes into cold work
 
02:44:43.269 --> 02:44:43.279 align:start position:0%
and it goes down through there's
 
02:44:46.150 --> 02:44:46.160 align:start position:0%
multiple homes an old farm and so on and
 
02:44:48.309 --> 02:44:48.319 align:start position:0%
so forth so we have worked with mr arden
 
02:44:50.870 --> 02:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
on that dirt road because i think with
 
02:44:53.190 --> 02:44:53.200 align:start position:0%
his plans for his houses and stuff he
 
02:44:55.110 --> 02:44:55.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to change that so we've worked
 
02:44:56.469 --> 02:44:56.479 align:start position:0%
with him we've already got our attorney
 
02:44:59.590 --> 02:44:59.600 align:start position:0%
we've taken care of all that so um
 
02:44:59.600 --> 02:45:00.469 align:start position:0%
we've taken care of all that so um
is

02:45:00.469 --> 02:45:00.479 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:45:01.750 --> 02:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
is that
 
02:45:03.990 --> 02:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
part of this project
 
02:45:05.990 --> 02:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
no okay no this is pretty much the
 
02:45:08.150 --> 02:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
straight shot from the hotel right to
 
02:45:10.070 --> 02:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
the country club and that's the paved
 
02:45:12.630 --> 02:45:12.640 align:start position:0%
section this is a pic yeah okay it's a
 
02:45:15.190 --> 02:45:15.200 align:start position:0%
paved road all right thank you

welcome thank you thank you madam chair

and i'm here representing the balsams
 
02:45:53.389 --> 02:45:53.399 align:start position:0%
many of you saw me back here in
 
02:45:58.230 --> 02:45:58.240 align:start position:0%
2014 15 16 etcetera um mr otton
 
02:46:01.349 --> 02:46:01.359 align:start position:0%
apologizes he could not be here he had a
 
02:46:03.590 --> 02:46:03.600 align:start position:0%
meeting dealing with the balsams that he
 
02:46:06.230 --> 02:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
really could not change on short notice
 
02:46:07.990 --> 02:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
so you get me
 
02:46:10.790 --> 02:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
um i want to thank representative beers
 
02:46:13.269 --> 02:46:13.279 align:start position:0%
for putting in the amendment and also
 
02:46:15.590 --> 02:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
the delegation as well as the county
 
02:46:17.910 --> 02:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
commissioners for being so incredibly um
 
02:46:20.870 --> 02:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
supportive as representative wall said
 
02:46:21.990 --> 02:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:46:24.710 --> 02:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
really authorizes d.o.t
 
02:46:26.950 --> 02:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
to spend money
 
02:46:30.070 --> 02:46:30.080 align:start position:0%
on repairing that road just up to the
 
02:46:32.790 --> 02:46:32.800 align:start position:0%
standards they need in order to pass it
 
02:46:35.349 --> 02:46:35.359 align:start position:0%
off to the town of the county
 
02:46:37.830 --> 02:46:37.840 align:start position:0%
what's really important the financial
 
02:46:40.150 --> 02:46:40.160 align:start position:0%
planning is in place and the permits and
 
02:46:41.750 --> 02:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
that's really key
 
02:46:45.030 --> 02:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
that you don't spend a dime unless mr
 
02:46:47.349 --> 02:46:47.359 align:start position:0%
otton has all of his financing all of
 
02:46:50.070 --> 02:46:50.080 align:start position:0%
his permits everything's ready and so
 
02:46:51.510 --> 02:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
that's that's
 
02:46:53.110 --> 02:46:53.120 align:start position:0%
i think very important from a public
 
02:46:56.150 --> 02:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
policy point of view um as you know
 
02:46:57.429 --> 02:46:57.439 align:start position:0%
there have been lots of issues over
 
02:46:59.670 --> 02:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
these last couple of years this project
 
02:47:01.590 --> 02:47:01.600 align:start position:0%
we thought was moving forward got slowed
 
02:47:03.190 --> 02:47:03.200 align:start position:0%
down coveted certainly didn't help
 
02:47:05.510 --> 02:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
anything at all now it's definitely back
 
02:47:06.630 --> 02:47:06.640 align:start position:0%
on track
 
02:47:09.750 --> 02:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
um that he is working with
 
02:47:12.309 --> 02:47:12.319 align:start position:0%
goldman sachs in the county undoing a
 
02:47:14.870 --> 02:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
county municipal bond hopefully that
 
02:47:17.349 --> 02:47:17.359 align:start position:0%
will go to market sometime
 
02:47:19.990 --> 02:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
depending on the market within the next
 
02:47:22.950 --> 02:47:22.960 align:start position:0%
ever how many ever how many months
 
02:47:24.550 --> 02:47:24.560 align:start position:0%
but that's
 
02:47:27.269 --> 02:47:27.279 align:start position:0%
moving forward this is a complicated
 
02:47:29.590 --> 02:47:29.600 align:start position:0%
project and
 
02:47:31.269 --> 02:47:31.279 align:start position:0%
they're just it's a puzzle and there are
 
02:47:34.070 --> 02:47:34.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of pieces and the road is a really
 
02:47:37.190 --> 02:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
key part of the puzzle because the state
 
02:47:39.750 --> 02:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
owns the road and as you've heard people
 
02:47:42.150 --> 02:47:42.160 align:start position:0%
say you can't get up to the golf course
 
02:47:45.190 --> 02:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
and the golf course is a key element to
 
02:47:47.590 --> 02:47:47.600 align:start position:0%
the resort i mean we have issues with
 
02:47:49.429 --> 02:47:49.439 align:start position:0%
water because we have to do snow making
 
02:47:51.349 --> 02:47:51.359 align:start position:0%
we have issues with energy because we
 
02:47:54.070 --> 02:47:54.080 align:start position:0%
have to you know do the do the lifts
 
02:47:56.790 --> 02:47:56.800 align:start position:0%
we've got financing etc but equally
 
02:47:58.389 --> 02:47:58.399 align:start position:0%
important is the fact that we need
 
02:48:01.429 --> 02:48:01.439 align:start position:0%
access to the road and so
 
02:48:04.150 --> 02:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
this is really giving authority
 
02:48:07.269 --> 02:48:07.279 align:start position:0%
and we hope you get to spend the money
 
02:48:09.830 --> 02:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
and i'd be happy to answer answer any
 
02:48:11.830 --> 02:48:11.840 align:start position:0%
questions i can
 
02:48:14.630 --> 02:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
02:48:16.790 --> 02:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
for uh
 
02:48:19.110 --> 02:48:19.120 align:start position:0%
miss rosenberger
 
02:48:20.870 --> 02:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
representative edwards
 
02:48:20.880 --> 02:48:21.910 align:start position:0%
representative edwards
um

02:48:21.910 --> 02:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:48:25.110 --> 02:48:25.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for uh answering my question i
 
02:48:26.710 --> 02:48:26.720 align:start position:0%
actually this letter that just got
 
02:48:28.070 --> 02:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
delivered i i think you're here
 
02:48:31.110 --> 02:48:31.120 align:start position:0%
representing this the leslie otten the
 
02:48:32.870 --> 02:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
development and you can speak to what's
 
02:48:36.150 --> 02:48:36.160 align:start position:0%
in this letter um the way the way i read
 
02:48:38.790 --> 02:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
this i think this answers an earlier
 
02:48:41.670 --> 02:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
question i had my question earlier
 
02:48:41.680 --> 02:48:42.630 align:start position:0%
question i had my question earlier
was

02:48:42.630 --> 02:48:42.640 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:48:44.870 --> 02:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
i had understood that the legislative
 
02:48:47.830 --> 02:48:47.840 align:start position:0%
position was that the balsam resort
 
02:48:50.309 --> 02:48:50.319 align:start position:0%
needed to be funded through private
 
02:48:50.319 --> 02:48:51.429 align:start position:0%
needed to be funded through private
capital

02:48:51.429 --> 02:48:51.439 align:start position:0%
capital
 
02:48:53.990 --> 02:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
and so i was wondering the connection of
 
02:48:56.710 --> 02:48:56.720 align:start position:0%
between this state road project and that
 
02:48:59.190 --> 02:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
private capital this letter actually
 
02:49:01.670 --> 02:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
addresses that what we would be doing as
 
02:49:03.830 --> 02:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
i understand is we would be bringing
 
02:49:06.389 --> 02:49:06.399 align:start position:0%
this road up to standard we wouldn't be
 
02:49:09.510 --> 02:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
gold plating it we would be just meeting
 
02:49:11.750 --> 02:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
standard right and then upon meeting
 
02:49:15.670 --> 02:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
standard uh as we do in all cases uh
 
02:49:18.150 --> 02:49:18.160 align:start position:0%
when we have an ownership transfer we
 
02:49:19.990 --> 02:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
would then transfer the ownership of
 
02:49:22.070 --> 02:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
this road to the developer and the
 
02:49:24.630 --> 02:49:24.640 align:start position:0%
developer would therefore be responsible
 
02:49:24.640 --> 02:49:26.070 align:start position:0%
developer would therefore be responsible
forever

02:49:26.070 --> 02:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
forever
 
02:49:28.710 --> 02:49:28.720 align:start position:0%
it's off your books so so that that that
 
02:49:32.150 --> 02:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
answers my that question it it brings up
 
02:49:33.670 --> 02:49:33.680 align:start position:0%
the question though
 
02:49:36.950 --> 02:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
what if in 10 years the developer uh
 
02:49:39.429 --> 02:49:39.439 align:start position:0%
defaults or goes bankrupt what what what
 
02:49:41.110 --> 02:49:41.120 align:start position:0%
happens to the road ownership at that
 
02:49:41.120 --> 02:49:42.710 align:start position:0%
happens to the road ownership at that
point

02:49:42.710 --> 02:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
point
 
02:49:44.790 --> 02:49:44.800 align:start position:0%
well i think i don't know i will get
 
02:49:46.710 --> 02:49:46.720 align:start position:0%
back to you on that but i think the
 
02:49:49.590 --> 02:49:49.600 align:start position:0%
ownership would still stay with the
 
02:49:49.600 --> 02:49:50.710 align:start position:0%
ownership would still stay with the
balsams

02:49:50.710 --> 02:49:50.720 align:start position:0%
balsams
 
02:49:53.190 --> 02:49:53.200 align:start position:0%
because as i understand it what had been
 
02:49:55.510 --> 02:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
negotiated with d.o.t
 
02:49:58.790 --> 02:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
and and bea when it was dread way back
 
02:50:01.990 --> 02:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
in 1415 and 16 was that the state would
 
02:50:04.230 --> 02:50:04.240 align:start position:0%
bring the road just up to basic
 
02:50:07.030 --> 02:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
standards transfer it to the county or
 
02:50:08.710 --> 02:50:08.720 align:start position:0%
the or the
 
02:50:10.630 --> 02:50:10.640 align:start position:0%
town of colebrook they would then
 
02:50:13.750 --> 02:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
transfer it to the resort
 
02:50:15.830 --> 02:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
the develop the development authority
 
02:50:17.670 --> 02:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
and they would then
 
02:50:21.349 --> 02:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
own maintain the road as a private road
 
02:50:23.750 --> 02:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i totally answered it so
 
02:50:24.710 --> 02:50:24.720 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
02:50:26.950 --> 02:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
what i was just asking was for the worst
 
02:50:29.510 --> 02:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
case scenario and and 10 years after all
 
02:50:31.990 --> 02:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
of that if uh balsams were to go
 
02:50:33.429 --> 02:50:33.439 align:start position:0%
bankrupt again
 
02:50:35.990 --> 02:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
what what would happen to the ownership
 
02:50:37.830 --> 02:50:37.840 align:start position:0%
of that road well i think the ownership
 
02:50:40.150 --> 02:50:40.160 align:start position:0%
would stay with the balsams i think i'll
 
02:50:42.230 --> 02:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
double check but if it once you've
 
02:50:45.190 --> 02:50:45.200 align:start position:0%
transferred it to the private honor i
 
02:50:46.790 --> 02:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
think the private owner keeps and
 
02:50:48.790 --> 02:50:48.800 align:start position:0%
maintains the roads so in bankruptcy if
 
02:50:51.349 --> 02:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
the has been sold to another development
 
02:50:53.349 --> 02:50:53.359 align:start position:0%
company or someone it would go with the
 
02:50:55.990 --> 02:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
package just like the golf course the
 
02:50:59.190 --> 02:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:02.870 --> 02:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:05.830 --> 02:51:05.840 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for oh
 
02:51:06.870 --> 02:51:06.880 align:start position:0%
of course
 
02:51:09.110 --> 02:51:09.120 align:start position:0%
representative that's okay thank you
 
02:51:12.790 --> 02:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:15.190 --> 02:51:15.200 align:start position:0%
where this project is
 
02:51:18.630 --> 02:51:18.640 align:start position:0%
200 million plus
 
02:51:20.309 --> 02:51:20.319 align:start position:0%
and we're looking at
 
02:51:22.870 --> 02:51:22.880 align:start position:0%
this bill which is talking about we'll
 
02:51:26.710 --> 02:51:26.720 align:start position:0%
call it four million it can be easy
 
02:51:28.870 --> 02:51:28.880 align:start position:0%
four million over 200 million that's
 
02:51:31.750 --> 02:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
less than two percent of a total project
 
02:51:31.760 --> 02:51:33.349 align:start position:0%
less than two percent of a total project
right

02:51:33.349 --> 02:51:33.359 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:51:36.469 --> 02:51:36.479 align:start position:0%
has a developer considered possibly
 
02:51:38.230 --> 02:51:38.240 align:start position:0%
coming up with a
 
02:51:40.070 --> 02:51:40.080 align:start position:0%
rather than having the
 
02:51:42.790 --> 02:51:42.800 align:start position:0%
state pay for the 4 million
 
02:51:44.870 --> 02:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
of the developer adding that into his
 
02:51:46.550 --> 02:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
total construction costs and maybe
 
02:51:48.230 --> 02:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
coming up with an agreement with the
 
02:51:50.790 --> 02:51:50.800 align:start position:0%
state to transfer ownership
 
02:51:50.800 --> 02:51:51.910 align:start position:0%
state to transfer ownership
after

02:51:51.910 --> 02:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
after
 
02:51:54.550 --> 02:51:54.560 align:start position:0%
the road has been brought up to speed i
 
02:51:56.469 --> 02:51:56.479 align:start position:0%
will get back to you on an answer to
 
02:51:59.110 --> 02:51:59.120 align:start position:0%
that but it's my understanding that for
 
02:52:01.190 --> 02:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
the state and this would be a real
 
02:52:02.950 --> 02:52:02.960 align:start position:0%
question for d.o.t and maybe council
 
02:52:04.790 --> 02:52:04.800 align:start position:0%
kenny can answer but i think when the
 
02:52:08.070 --> 02:52:08.080 align:start position:0%
state transfers roads to private
 
02:52:10.469 --> 02:52:10.479 align:start position:0%
entities or private monitors they have
 
02:52:13.429 --> 02:52:13.439 align:start position:0%
to be brought up to quote standard
 
02:52:16.070 --> 02:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
and when this was initially done it was
 
02:52:18.469 --> 02:52:18.479 align:start position:0%
2.5 million dollars like the project i
 
02:52:22.309 --> 02:52:22.319 align:start position:0%
think was 1.65 i mean 165 million
 
02:52:25.349 --> 02:52:25.359 align:start position:0%
well needless to say we've got inflation
 
02:52:25.359 --> 02:52:26.469 align:start position:0%
well needless to say we've got inflation
but

02:52:26.469 --> 02:52:26.479 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:52:28.630 --> 02:52:28.640 align:start position:0%
i think they have to bring it up to
 
02:52:31.030 --> 02:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
standard whatever that may be now this
 
02:52:34.389 --> 02:52:34.399 align:start position:0%
is as i understand it a maximum of 4.1
 
02:52:35.590 --> 02:52:35.600 align:start position:0%
so if
 
02:52:38.150 --> 02:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
if the state's able to bring it up for
 
02:52:38.160 --> 02:52:40.630 align:start position:0%
if the state's able to bring it up for
2.5

02:52:40.630 --> 02:52:40.640 align:start position:0%
2.5
 
02:52:42.870 --> 02:52:42.880 align:start position:0%
that that's that's where it is but that
 
02:52:45.190 --> 02:52:45.200 align:start position:0%
would really be a question for d.o.t i
 
02:52:45.200 --> 02:52:48.309 align:start position:0%
would really be a question for d.o.t i
think

02:52:48.309 --> 02:52:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:50.230 --> 02:52:50.240 align:start position:0%
yeah i think what i'm getting
 
02:52:51.590 --> 02:52:51.600 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you madam chair i think what
 
02:52:54.710 --> 02:52:54.720 align:start position:0%
i'm getting at is there a
 
02:52:59.190 --> 02:52:59.200 align:start position:0%
way for the developer the developer to
 
02:53:02.150 --> 02:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
absorb a the cost of bringing it up to
 
02:53:04.230 --> 02:53:04.240 align:start position:0%
snuff since that will eventually be
 
02:53:06.230 --> 02:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
turned over to the
 
02:53:07.910 --> 02:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
um and i don't know the mechanics of it
 
02:53:10.230 --> 02:53:10.240 align:start position:0%
maybe he can't do that i don't know but
 
02:53:10.240 --> 02:53:11.030 align:start position:0%
maybe he can't do that i don't know but
as

02:53:11.030 --> 02:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
as
 
02:53:13.190 --> 02:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
when it's two less than two percent of a
 
02:53:15.910 --> 02:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
total project why can't that be done by
 
02:53:18.550 --> 02:53:18.560 align:start position:0%
the developer i will go back and ask mr
 
02:53:20.550 --> 02:53:20.560 align:start position:0%
otton if that was in the discussions
 
02:53:22.790 --> 02:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
back in 2014
 
02:53:26.070 --> 02:53:26.080 align:start position:0%
um as i understand it way back when
 
02:53:28.870 --> 02:53:28.880 align:start position:0%
the state was doing what i call some
 
02:53:31.030 --> 02:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
enhancements getting this road back up
 
02:53:33.510 --> 02:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
to snuff was one of them
 
02:53:35.590 --> 02:53:35.600 align:start position:0%
in order for the project to go forward
 
02:53:37.590 --> 02:53:37.600 align:start position:0%
but i'll go back and ask mr otton if it
 
02:53:39.830 --> 02:53:39.840 align:start position:0%
was if it was discussed
 
02:53:43.510 --> 02:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
i'll be happy to ask him yeah uh
 
02:53:45.510 --> 02:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
we need an answer
 
02:53:48.630 --> 02:53:48.640 align:start position:0%
on that question by tomorrow morning
 
02:53:51.429 --> 02:53:51.439 align:start position:0%
i will i know his meeting starts at one
 
02:53:53.349 --> 02:53:53.359 align:start position:0%
so i'll see if i can even get you an
 
02:53:55.349 --> 02:53:55.359 align:start position:0%
answer before the work session if i can
 
02:53:58.230 --> 02:53:58.240 align:start position:0%
locate him okay that that's fine we just
 
02:53:59.910 --> 02:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
yeah yep i'll get you we're in a time
 
02:54:02.070 --> 02:54:02.080 align:start position:0%
crunch right no i do know that thank you

[Music]

02:54:05.030 --> 02:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:54:06.550 --> 02:54:06.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:54:08.070 --> 02:54:08.080 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry we did have one more
 
02:54:11.670 --> 02:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:13.590 --> 02:54:13.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair just as a matter
 
02:54:14.790 --> 02:54:14.800 align:start position:0%
of clarity
 
02:54:16.950 --> 02:54:16.960 align:start position:0%
um the statement was made that the
 
02:54:19.110 --> 02:54:19.120 align:start position:0%
balsams goes bankrupt again and i don't
 
02:54:21.190 --> 02:54:21.200 align:start position:0%
believe the balsams went bankrupt i
 
02:54:23.110 --> 02:54:23.120 align:start position:0%
think the owners chose to close it and i
 
02:54:25.030 --> 02:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
just would like to interject that as
 
02:54:27.030 --> 02:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
clarity i think it's kind of important
 
02:54:29.590 --> 02:54:29.600 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah that that's
 
02:54:31.269 --> 02:54:31.279 align:start position:0%
that's very true they did not go
 
02:54:31.279 --> 02:54:32.950 align:start position:0%
that's very true they did not go
bankrupt

02:54:32.950 --> 02:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
bankrupt
 
02:54:34.630 --> 02:54:34.640 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
02:54:34.640 --> 02:54:35.510 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
uh

02:54:35.510 --> 02:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:54:38.469 --> 02:54:38.479 align:start position:0%
representative uh thompson
 
02:54:40.870 --> 02:54:40.880 align:start position:0%
had uh wanted to testify and
 
02:54:44.389 --> 02:54:44.399 align:start position:0%
unfortunately he is in a uh executive
 
02:54:47.830 --> 02:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
committee meeting and so
 
02:54:51.349 --> 02:54:51.359 align:start position:0%
i apologize that he wasn't able to
 
02:54:54.309 --> 02:54:54.319 align:start position:0%
get to testify before that occurred
 
02:54:55.910 --> 02:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
but he will
 
02:54:58.950 --> 02:54:58.960 align:start position:0%
be part of the record as wanting to
 
02:54:58.960 --> 02:55:00.790 align:start position:0%
be part of the record as wanting to
so

02:55:00.790 --> 02:55:00.800 align:start position:0%
