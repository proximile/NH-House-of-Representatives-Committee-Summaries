what a special and kind person he really

Greg thank you Mr Speaker it's been a
 
00:36:12.910 --> 00:36:12.920 align:start position:0%
hot minute I didn't hear my name I don't
 
00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:14.720 align:start position:0%
it does goes kind of without saying but
 
00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:17.160 align:start position:0%
relationships are complicated even the
 
00:36:19.870 --> 00:36:19.880 align:start position:0%
good ones have some complications and
 
00:36:22.069 --> 00:36:22.079 align:start position:0%
children and with children those
 
00:36:24.589 --> 00:36:24.599 align:start position:0%
complications grow exponentially now
 
00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
throw in a separation of parents do due
 
00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
to an inability to cohabitate for
 
00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
various reasons in those complications
 
00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:35.640 align:start position:0%
Skyrocket there is no simple one size
 
00:36:38.990 --> 00:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
fits all fixed to make everyone happy
 
00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
however with current statutes and
 
00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
judicial procedures just over 90% of
 
00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:46.440 align:start position:0%
cases agree on what is best for their
 
00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
child without the need for further Court
 
00:36:52.309 --> 00:36:52.319 align:start position:0%
action to decide the remaining
 
00:36:55.829 --> 00:36:55.839 align:start position:0%
9% those are our small number of high
 
00:36:57.630 --> 00:36:57.640 align:start position:0%
conflict cases
 
00:36:59.190 --> 00:36:59.200 align:start position:0%
high conflict where there have been
 
00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
major breakdowns between parents there
 
00:37:04.750 --> 00:37:04.760 align:start position:0%
could be substance abuse major monetary
 
00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
disagreements mental health
 
00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:09.560 align:start position:0%
complications among other things this is
 
00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
also where we see domestic violence
 
00:37:15.069 --> 00:37:15.079 align:start position:0%
claims in that layer of substantiated
 
00:37:17.069 --> 00:37:17.079 align:start position:0%
claims we have those that lack the
 
00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
insight to understand that their
 
00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:21.400 align:start position:0%
behaviors are abusive and not just a
 
00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:23.440 align:start position:0%
matter of course in a
 
00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
relationship so what we are looking at
 
00:37:29.069 --> 00:37:29.079 align:start position:0%
with hb1 85 is a bill that is looking to
 
00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
make that quick fix for a small
 
00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:34.240 align:start position:0%
percentage not put the needs of families
 
00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:36.760 align:start position:0%
and Children First particularly in
 
00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
situations where there is abuse and
 
00:37:40.829 --> 00:37:40.839 align:start position:0%
parents who are incapable of providing
 
00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
for their children's needs or where
 
00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
parents don't live in close
 
00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
proximity claims about bills like this
 
00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:51.160 align:start position:0%
lowering cases of domestic violence just
 
00:37:54.750 --> 00:37:54.760 align:start position:0%
don't hold water while in 2019 one of
 
00:37:56.589 --> 00:37:56.599 align:start position:0%
the few states that has a shared parent
 
00:37:59.230 --> 00:37:59.240 align:start position:0%
parenting law had some statistics
 
00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
claiming that the Shared Parenting Bill
 
00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:03.400 align:start position:0%
greatly solved the problem their first
 
00:38:06.109 --> 00:38:06.119 align:start position:0%
ever Statewide data from 22 that was
 
00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
just released in 23 shows a market
 
00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
increase in domestic violence as
 
00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
legislators looking at bills like this
 
00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:17.560 align:start position:0%
is a precarious situation there must be
 
00:38:18.829 --> 00:38:18.839 align:start position:0%
a balance of
 
00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:22.720 align:start position:0%
power we can't just continue to change
 
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:24.640 align:start position:0%
wording in hopes of
 
00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
forcing judges into a one size fits none
 
00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
approach when they should be looking at
 
00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
each very unique case to decide what is
 
00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:35.160 align:start position:0%
best in the best interest for families
 
00:38:37.550 --> 00:38:37.560 align:start position:0%
on that same note we can't give judges
 
00:38:39.069 --> 00:38:39.079 align:start position:0%
who don't want to bother with the
 
00:38:41.589 --> 00:38:41.599 align:start position:0%
complexities of these cases an easy and
 
00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:44.720 align:start position:0%
potentially damaging easy out the
 
00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:47.000 align:start position:0%
language of our current bill frequent
 
00:38:50.349 --> 00:38:50.359 align:start position:0%
and continuing contact is not a problem
 
00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:52.640 align:start position:0%
with the language it's a problem with
 
00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
the application of that language that
 
00:38:57.630 --> 00:38:57.640 align:start position:0%
application is is a part of judicial
 
00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
training it is not something we solve
 
00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
with this bill please vote for the best
 
00:39:07.230 --> 00:39:07.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
ball thank you Mr Speaker and I ask for
 
00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:20.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:23.349 --> 00:39:23.359 align:start position:0%
vote New Hampshire RSA makes it clear
 
00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
that because people I'm sorry makes it
 
00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:28.760 align:start position:0%
clear and I quote because children do
 
00:39:30.829 --> 00:39:30.839 align:start position:0%
best when both parents have a stable and
 
00:39:33.589 --> 00:39:33.599 align:start position:0%
meaningful involvement in their lives it
 
00:39:36.349 --> 00:39:36.359 align:start position:0%
is a state policy of this state unless
 
00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
shown that a particular case is
 
00:39:42.069 --> 00:39:42.079 align:start position:0%
detrimental in a particular case it is
 
00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
detrimental to the child to support
 
00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
frequent and continued contact with each
 
00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
child and both parents the words of RSA
 
00:39:54.109 --> 00:39:54.119 align:start position:0%
461 have led most parents seeking a
 
00:39:57.550 --> 00:39:57.560 align:start position:0%
divorce to enter Family Court believing
 
00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:00.640 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire is a 5050 state in
 
00:40:03.870 --> 00:40:03.880 align:start position:0%
fact many attorneys in our state advise
 
00:40:06.390 --> 00:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
their clients not to ask for more than
 
00:40:08.990 --> 00:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
50% parenting time because it is
 
00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:11.480 align:start position:0%
understood that frequent and continuing
 
00:40:14.349 --> 00:40:14.359 align:start position:0%
contact means approximately equal
 
00:40:14.359 --> 00:40:16.150 align:start position:0%
contact means approximately equal
parenting

00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
parenting
 
00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
time even some of the members of the
 
00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
children and family law committee
 
00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:22.280 align:start position:0%
interpreted the words frequent and
 
00:40:25.349 --> 00:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
continuing contact to mean approximately
 
00:40:27.870 --> 00:40:27.880 align:start position:0%
equal that is until the special
 
00:40:30.309 --> 00:40:30.319 align:start position:0%
committee to investigate Family Court
 
00:40:32.349 --> 00:40:32.359 align:start position:0%
went to visit courtrooms around the
 
00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
state and interviewed many judges and
 
00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:38.240 align:start position:0%
what the special committee found shocked
 
00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:40.720 align:start position:0%
us while the majority of Family Court
 
00:40:43.109 --> 00:40:43.119 align:start position:0%
judges interpreted frequent and
 
00:40:46.109 --> 00:40:46.119 align:start position:0%
continuing contact to mean a starting
 
00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
point of 5050 and then moving away from
 
00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
that based on Parental input and other
 
00:40:54.829 --> 00:40:54.839 align:start position:0%
extenuating circumstances we were
 
00:40:57.870 --> 00:40:57.880 align:start position:0%
shocked to find three three judges did
 
00:40:59.790 --> 00:40:59.800 align:start position:0%
not approach parenting plans with a
 
00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:02.720 align:start position:0%
starting point of 50/50 they believe
 
00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
parenting PL should start at zero and
 
00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
then work upward in other words whoever
 
00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:11.160 align:start position:0%
is a primary bread winner whether it be
 
00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
the mother or the father could be
 
00:41:15.069 --> 00:41:15.079 align:start position:0%
relegated to being a visitor in their
 
00:41:17.470 --> 00:41:17.480 align:start position:0%
child's life seeing their child every
 
00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
other weekend and maybe a Wednesday
 
00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
night for dinner solely because that
 
00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
parent spent less time with the children
 
00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:28.640 align:start position:0%
prior to deliver divorce due to work
 
00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:32.200 align:start position:0%
obligations outside of the home clearly
 
00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
it is neither Fair nor Equitable to the
 
00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:38.640 align:start position:0%
children who by our own State policy do
 
00:41:42.069 --> 00:41:42.079 align:start position:0%
best when both parents have a stable and
 
00:41:45.069 --> 00:41:45.079 align:start position:0%
meaningful involvement in their lives
 
00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
recent State and National studies show
 
00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:50.640 align:start position:0%
that failing to provide children with
 
00:41:52.589 --> 00:41:52.599 align:start position:0%
opportunities for a stable and
 
00:41:55.349 --> 00:41:55.359 align:start position:0%
meaningful relationship with both
 
00:41:58.470 --> 00:41:58.480 align:start position:0%
parents have serious detrimental effects
 
00:42:01.589 --> 00:42:01.599 align:start position:0%
on the children according to researchers
 
00:42:03.589 --> 00:42:03.599 align:start position:0%
the absence of a father in a child's
 
00:42:07.109 --> 00:42:07.119 align:start position:0%
life is nothing more nothing short of
 
00:42:10.309 --> 00:42:10.319 align:start position:0%
disastrous 71% of high school dropouts
 
00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
are fatherless children and 90% of
 
00:42:16.069 --> 00:42:16.079 align:start position:0%
runaway children have an absent
 
00:42:19.109 --> 00:42:19.119 align:start position:0%
father knowing these statistics how can
 
00:42:21.870 --> 00:42:21.880 align:start position:0%
we allow Family Court to lack
 
00:42:23.790 --> 00:42:23.800 align:start position:0%
consistency in the approach to the
 
00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
parenting plans how can we as
 
00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
legislators allow families to walk into
 
00:42:31.589 --> 00:42:31.599 align:start position:0%
court with similar circumstances and
 
00:42:33.790 --> 00:42:33.800 align:start position:0%
walk out with different outcomes based
 
00:42:36.270 --> 00:42:36.280 align:start position:0%
upon which courtroom they walked into
 
00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
and which judge they were
 
00:42:41.309 --> 00:42:41.319 align:start position:0%
assigned New Hampshire is better than
 
00:42:44.109 --> 00:42:44.119 align:start position:0%
that we are better than that the
 
00:42:46.589 --> 00:42:46.599 align:start position:0%
evidence is clear for the past several
 
00:42:50.349 --> 00:42:50.359 align:start position:0%
years over 20 New Hampshire judges have
 
00:42:52.309 --> 00:42:52.319 align:start position:0%
been helping parents create parenting
 
00:42:54.430 --> 00:42:54.440 align:start position:0%
plans that provide each parent
 
00:42:56.829 --> 00:42:56.839 align:start position:0%
approximately equal parenting time time
 
00:43:00.190 --> 00:43:00.200 align:start position:0%
whether that be 5050 or 6040 and we have
 
00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:03.680 align:start position:0%
seen no increases of neglect or abuse in
 
00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:05.349 align:start position:0%
seen no increases of neglect or abuse in
those

00:43:05.349 --> 00:43:05.359 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
families it is time to get all of our
 
00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:10.720 align:start position:0%
family court judges on the same page and
 
00:43:13.230 --> 00:43:13.240 align:start position:0%
interpret the law as it was
 
00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:15.240 align:start position:0%
intended it is time to take the
 
00:43:18.670 --> 00:43:18.680 align:start position:0%
vagueness out of RSA 461 and make it
 
00:43:21.589 --> 00:43:21.599 align:start position:0%
clear New Hampshire children do best
 
00:43:24.349 --> 00:43:24.359 align:start position:0%
when both parents have a stable in their
 
00:43:27.069 --> 00:43:27.079 align:start position:0%
lives it is time
 
00:43:30.309 --> 00:43:30.319 align:start position:0%
to make it clear that meaningful
 
00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
involvement means approximately equal
 
00:43:38.430 --> 00:43:38.440 align:start position:0%
parenting time with each child and both
 
00:43:41.829 --> 00:43:41.839 align:start position:0%
parents this amendment changes only four
 
00:43:44.069 --> 00:43:44.079 align:start position:0%
words in RSA
 
00:43:46.910 --> 00:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
461 it in no way diminishes the
 
00:43:49.309 --> 00:43:49.319 align:start position:0%
authority of the judge to use his
 
00:43:51.630 --> 00:43:51.640 align:start position:0%
discretion in cases where approximately
 
00:43:53.470 --> 00:43:53.480 align:start position:0%
equal parenting time would be
 
00:43:56.710 --> 00:43:56.720 align:start position:0%
detrimental to the child this Amendment
 
00:43:59.710 --> 00:43:59.720 align:start position:0%
continues to provide the exact same
 
00:44:02.069 --> 00:44:02.079 align:start position:0%
protection for victims of domestic
 
00:44:03.790 --> 00:44:03.800 align:start position:0%
violence abuse and
 
00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
neglect and this amendment does not
 
00:44:08.790 --> 00:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
prevent parents from creating parenting
 
00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
plans that work for them four simple
 
00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:15.960 align:start position:0%
words four words that create a fair and
 
00:44:18.309 --> 00:44:18.319 align:start position:0%
Equitable starting point for the vast
 
00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
majority of good loving parents who
 
00:44:23.069 --> 00:44:23.079 align:start position:0%
agree they can no longer live together
 
00:44:24.829 --> 00:44:24.839 align:start position:0%
but want what's in the best interest of
 
00:44:28.750 --> 00:44:28.760 align:start position:0%
their child four words that would assure
 
00:44:31.630 --> 00:44:31.640 align:start position:0%
all judges interpret the law in the same
 
00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
manner four words that would make it
 
00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:37.480 align:start position:0%
clear that New Hampshire children do
 
00:44:40.670 --> 00:44:40.680 align:start position:0%
best when both parents have a stable and
 
00:44:43.390 --> 00:44:43.400 align:start position:0%
meaningful involvement in their lives by
 
00:44:46.069 --> 00:44:46.079 align:start position:0%
supporting approximately equal parenting
 
00:44:50.230 --> 00:44:50.240 align:start position:0%
time between each child and both parents
 
00:44:52.750 --> 00:44:52.760 align:start position:0%
please press the green button and make
 
00:44:54.790 --> 00:44:54.800 align:start position:0%
it the policy of our great state of New
 
00:44:57.109 --> 00:44:57.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that children children do best
 
00:44:59.030 --> 00:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
when they have approximately equal
 
00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:24.880 align:start position:0%

seconded yeah it's sufficiently seconded
 
00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:46.720 align:start position:0%
this will be a roll call vote members

00:46:39.270 --> 00:46:39.280 align:start position:0%
the question before the house is the
 
00:46:42.309 --> 00:46:42.319 align:start position:0%
report about to pass as amended on House
 
00:46:45.230 --> 00:46:45.240 align:start position:0%
Bill 185 this is a roll call
 
00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
vote representative long is recognized
 
00:46:51.150 --> 00:46:51.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr
 
00:46:55.470 --> 00:46:55.480 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that New Hampshire
 
00:46:56.950 --> 00:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
coalition ition against Domestic and
 
00:46:59.430 --> 00:46:59.440 align:start position:0%
Sexual Violence in the state's 12 crisis
 
00:47:01.150 --> 00:47:01.160 align:start position:0%
centers oppose this bill because it
 
00:47:03.069 --> 00:47:03.079 align:start position:0%
would endanger victims of domestic
 
00:47:05.790 --> 00:47:05.800 align:start position:0%
violence and their children and if I
 
00:47:08.510 --> 00:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
further know that there is no one size
 
00:47:10.150 --> 00:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
fits-all for every family in New
 
00:47:12.349 --> 00:47:12.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and if I know that house bill
 
00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
185 will force families into parenting
 
00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
plans that do not meet their unique
 
00:47:19.309 --> 00:47:19.319 align:start position:0%
needs and finally if I know that the
 
00:47:21.390 --> 00:47:21.400 align:start position:0%
majority of child custody and parenting
 
00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
time in New Hampshire already exist in
 
00:47:26.589 --> 00:47:26.599 align:start position:0%
equal parenting and if I know that
 
00:47:28.349 --> 00:47:28.359 align:start position:0%
judges should continue to have
 
00:47:30.069 --> 00:47:30.079 align:start position:0%
discretion when considering the best

then representative Maori is recognized

00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
00:47:54.990 --> 00:47:55.000 align:start position:0%
if I know that more than 40 Years of
 
00:47:57.190 --> 00:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
social science research establishes a
 
00:47:59.150 --> 00:47:59.160 align:start position:0%
growing consensus that in the vast
 
00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
majority of cases children raised and
 
00:48:04.030 --> 00:48:04.040 align:start position:0%
shared parenting Arrangements score
 
00:48:06.069 --> 00:48:06.079 align:start position:0%
significantly higher on almost every
 
00:48:08.510 --> 00:48:08.520 align:start position:0%
metric of child well-being than those
 
00:48:11.230 --> 00:48:11.240 align:start position:0%
raised in Soul custody arrangements and
 
00:48:13.230 --> 00:48:13.240 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I further know that re
 
00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
research shows that benefits to Children
 
00:48:17.829 --> 00:48:17.839 align:start position:0%
arise because both parents are
 
00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
significantly involved in ordinary
 
00:48:21.950 --> 00:48:21.960 align:start position:0%
day-to-day parenting responsibilities
 
00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
and the benefits of shared parenting for
 
00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
children increases as the time with each
 
00:48:29.069 --> 00:48:29.079 align:start position:0%
parent approaches
 
00:48:31.470 --> 00:48:31.480 align:start position:0%
equality and Mr Speaker if I know that
 
00:48:33.270 --> 00:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
there is no empirical evidence to
 
00:48:35.390 --> 00:48:35.400 align:start position:0%
support shared parenting leaves children
 
00:48:38.510 --> 00:48:38.520 align:start position:0%
vulnerable to to abuse then Mr Speaker
 
00:48:40.270 --> 00:48:40.280 align:start position:0%
would I go ahead and press the green
 
00:48:45.510 --> 00:48:45.520 align:start position:0%

Sullivan thank you Mr Speaker so this
 
00:54:55.549 --> 00:54:55.559 align:start position:0%
bill on its face sounds is like actually
 
00:54:58.430 --> 00:54:58.440 align:start position:0%
a decent idea the idea of this bill it's
 
00:55:00.390 --> 00:55:00.400 align:start position:0%
under what is the title relative to Fair
 
00:55:02.309 --> 00:55:02.319 align:start position:0%
access of financial services that
 
00:55:03.430 --> 00:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
suggests that there's some sort of
 
00:55:05.990 --> 00:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
problem with discrimination going on and
 
00:55:07.870 --> 00:55:07.880 align:start position:0%
perhaps there's a a reason for us to
 
00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:10.240 align:start position:0%
step in when you dig a Little Deeper
 
00:55:11.870 --> 00:55:11.880 align:start position:0%
this is definitely a a wolf and sheep's
 
00:55:14.190 --> 00:55:14.200 align:start position:0%
clothing type bill because what we see
 
00:55:17.309 --> 00:55:17.319 align:start position:0%
happening is the protected classes that
 
00:55:18.750 --> 00:55:18.760 align:start position:0%
we all I think would be concerned about
 
00:55:20.750 --> 00:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
being discriminated against race gender
 
00:55:22.309 --> 00:55:22.319 align:start position:0%
religion they're all protected under
 
00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
numerous banking laws that are already
 
00:55:25.349 --> 00:55:25.359 align:start position:0%
on the books things like the Civil
 
00:55:28.029 --> 00:55:28.039 align:start position:0%
Rights Act the Equal Credit Opportunity
 
00:55:29.670 --> 00:55:29.680 align:start position:0%
Act Community reinvestment act there's
 
00:55:31.510 --> 00:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
tons of these those are just a few that
 
00:55:32.829 --> 00:55:32.839 align:start position:0%
I just named that cover all the
 
00:55:34.910 --> 00:55:34.920 align:start position:0%
protected classes I think the vast
 
00:55:36.670 --> 00:55:36.680 align:start position:0%
majority of us in society are concerned
 
00:55:38.990 --> 00:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
about being discriminated against what
 
00:55:40.750 --> 00:55:40.760 align:start position:0%
this does the motivation behind this
 
00:55:43.710 --> 00:55:43.720 align:start position:0%
bill is to try to and and for me the
 
00:55:45.630 --> 00:55:45.640 align:start position:0%
most offensive part of it is it's it's
 
00:55:47.829 --> 00:55:47.839 align:start position:0%
an egregious attack on the free market
 
00:55:49.349 --> 00:55:49.359 align:start position:0%
and an attempt to
 
00:55:52.230 --> 00:55:52.240 align:start position:0%
push kind of uneven substantiated
 
00:55:55.349 --> 00:55:55.359 align:start position:0%
concerns into the the way we give out
 
00:55:57.470 --> 00:55:57.480 align:start position:0%
loans so for example the motivation
 
00:55:59.950 --> 00:55:59.960 align:start position:0%
behind this is to prevent Banks from
 
00:56:01.470 --> 00:56:01.480 align:start position:0%
considering things that are not
 
00:56:03.870 --> 00:56:03.880 align:start position:0%
traditional Financial metrics now who's
 
00:56:05.270 --> 00:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
going to Define what traditional
 
00:56:06.870 --> 00:56:06.880 align:start position:0%
Financial metrics are do we think that
 
00:56:09.190 --> 00:56:09.200 align:start position:0%
traditional Financial metrics have been
 
00:56:11.309 --> 00:56:11.319 align:start position:0%
static throughout time of course not
 
00:56:13.069 --> 00:56:13.079 align:start position:0%
there are different Financial metrics
 
00:56:14.270 --> 00:56:14.280 align:start position:0%
that are considered today than they were
 
00:56:16.510 --> 00:56:16.520 align:start position:0%
considered in 1900 and no doubt there'll
 
00:56:18.670 --> 00:56:18.680 align:start position:0%
be different ones traditional Financial
 
00:56:21.270 --> 00:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
metrics that will be considered in
 
00:56:24.510 --> 00:56:24.520 align:start position:0%
201100 so it it tramps on the idea that
 
00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:26.960 align:start position:0%
the free Market is is somehow
 
00:56:29.510 --> 00:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
ineffective at deciding what business
 
00:56:33.109 --> 00:56:33.119 align:start position:0%
should or should not get loans so the
 
00:56:36.150 --> 00:56:36.160 align:start position:0%
concern here was that some banks might
 
00:56:39.710 --> 00:56:39.720 align:start position:0%
make loans based on things like ESG
 
00:56:42.190 --> 00:56:42.200 align:start position:0%
which are the sustainability type things
 
00:56:44.950 --> 00:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
and to my response is hey I don't I
 
00:56:46.950 --> 00:56:46.960 align:start position:0%
don't really have a a say on whether or
 
00:56:48.430 --> 00:56:48.440 align:start position:0%
not a bank should or should not make
 
00:56:51.470 --> 00:56:51.480 align:start position:0%
loans based on other goals that they may
 
00:56:53.309 --> 00:56:53.319 align:start position:0%
have all banks presumably are in the
 
00:56:55.069 --> 00:56:55.079 align:start position:0%
business of making money if they're
 
00:56:56.870 --> 00:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
going to consider these things it's part
 
00:56:58.549 --> 00:56:58.559 align:start position:0%
of their Innovative strategy or what
 
00:57:00.789 --> 00:57:00.799 align:start position:0%
they think to be a successful strategy
 
00:57:02.750 --> 00:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
in winning business and making money
 
00:57:04.630 --> 00:57:04.640 align:start position:0%
with their Investments who are we as
 
00:57:06.270 --> 00:57:06.280 align:start position:0%
legislators who don't fully understand
 
00:57:08.510 --> 00:57:08.520 align:start position:0%
the banking industry and the needs of
 
00:57:11.150 --> 00:57:11.160 align:start position:0%
the banking industry to tell them what
 
00:57:13.589 --> 00:57:13.599 align:start position:0%
they can and cannot consider it would
 
00:57:15.950 --> 00:57:15.960 align:start position:0%
kill innovation in the banking sector it
 
00:57:17.510 --> 00:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
would also hurt innovation in the
 
00:57:19.150 --> 00:57:19.160 align:start position:0%
private sector because it's finance that
 
00:57:20.829 --> 00:57:20.839 align:start position:0%
helps Drive Innovation by providing the
 
00:57:22.069 --> 00:57:22.079 align:start position:0%
money that they need to get new
 
00:57:25.029 --> 00:57:25.039 align:start position:0%
businesses going the idea that the free
 
00:57:27.549 --> 00:57:27.559 align:start position:0%
Market can't handle this problem if it
 
00:57:29.990 --> 00:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
indeed is a problem is kind of on its
 
00:57:33.549 --> 00:57:33.559 align:start position:0%
face a bit ging to me so if there is a
 
00:57:35.910 --> 00:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
concern that there is collusion going on
 
00:57:37.349 --> 00:57:37.359 align:start position:0%
say all the banks are getting together
 
00:57:38.710 --> 00:57:38.720 align:start position:0%
and saying we're not going to give loans
 
00:57:41.069 --> 00:57:41.079 align:start position:0%
to an oil company or some other company
 
00:57:42.950 --> 00:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
that is offensive under the ESG
 
00:57:45.870 --> 00:57:45.880 align:start position:0%
framework that's already illegal that we
 
00:57:47.430 --> 00:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
go to the Department of Justice we go to
 
00:57:48.870 --> 00:57:48.880 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office point it
 
00:57:51.950 --> 00:57:51.960 align:start position:0%
out and sue them the these things this
 
00:57:54.589 --> 00:57:54.599 align:start position:0%
is a a solution to a problem that does
 
00:57:56.349 --> 00:57:56.359 align:start position:0%
not not exist it was not proven to the
 
00:57:59.270 --> 00:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
committee and I really hope that you
 
00:58:01.390 --> 00:58:01.400 align:start position:0%
guys can join me vote down the interim
 
00:58:02.510 --> 00:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
study which suggests that there's a
 
00:58:04.029 --> 00:58:04.039 align:start position:0%
problem that's worth studying when in
 
00:58:05.829 --> 00:58:05.839 align:start position:0%
fact there is not if you believe in the
 
00:58:08.029 --> 00:58:08.039 align:start position:0%
free market and you are concerned of the
 
00:58:10.750 --> 00:58:10.760 align:start position:0%
idea of growing our Nanny State and
 
00:58:12.270 --> 00:58:12.280 align:start position:0%
growing the size of our government
 
00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
please vote no against the interim study
 
00:58:16.309 --> 00:58:16.319 align:start position:0%
for this so we can make a better motion

Speaker uh Mr Speaker some of you might
 
00:58:36.430 --> 00:58:36.440 align:start position:0%
have attended the study committee uh
 
00:58:39.950 --> 00:58:39.960 align:start position:0%
continuing education and in which uh at
 
00:58:43.309 --> 00:58:43.319 align:start position:0%
that session I educated you all on what
 
00:58:46.630 --> 00:58:46.640 align:start position:0%
Commerce does and commerce has broken up
 
00:58:48.390 --> 00:58:48.400 align:start position:0%
into several different
 
00:58:53.470 --> 00:58:53.480 align:start position:0%
divisions and we uh tried not to pass
 
00:58:56.109 --> 00:58:56.119 align:start position:0%
legislation that is uh not ready for
 
00:59:00.390 --> 00:59:00.400 align:start position:0%
prime time and instead we keep the bill
 
00:59:03.190 --> 00:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
we like to keep it in the committee so
 
00:59:06.309 --> 00:59:06.319 align:start position:0%
that if there's another headline another
 
00:59:08.549 --> 00:59:08.559 align:start position:0%
issue that uh people say well why aren't
 
00:59:10.270 --> 00:59:10.280 align:start position:0%
you doing something about this or what
 
00:59:14.309 --> 00:59:14.319 align:start position:0%
how can this happen at least we have a
 
00:59:16.750 --> 00:59:16.760 align:start position:0%
standing uh subcommittee that will
 
00:59:18.510 --> 00:59:18.520 align:start position:0%
review the issue and we have a
 
00:59:21.309 --> 00:59:21.319 align:start position:0%
legislation that we can use as a title
 
00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
to call that hearing that is the only
 
00:59:26.549 --> 00:59:26.559 align:start position:0%
reason we are retaining this bill or
 
00:59:28.950 --> 00:59:28.960 align:start position:0%
interim study excuse me retained it and
 
00:59:30.549 --> 00:59:30.559 align:start position:0%
then didn't do anything with it we're
 
00:59:32.750 --> 00:59:32.760 align:start position:0%

Commerce Committee is going to be out to
 
00:59:41.150 --> 00:59:41.160 align:start position:0%
uh change the way we do banking in the
 
00:59:42.630 --> 00:59:42.640 align:start position:0%
state as a matter of fact we have
 
00:59:44.789 --> 00:59:44.799 align:start position:0%
another bill just coming next up is
 
00:59:46.870 --> 00:59:46.880 align:start position:0%

inquiry if I believe this underlying
 
01:01:23.069 --> 01:01:23.079 align:start position:0%
bill would simply grow the size of our
 
01:01:25.829 --> 01:01:25.839 align:start position:0%
government and increase the regulatory
 
01:01:27.710 --> 01:01:27.720 align:start position:0%
burden for the New Hampshire banking
 
01:01:31.349 --> 01:01:31.359 align:start position:0%

size of government without any clear
 
01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:38.400 align:start position:0%

01:05:22.549 --> 01:05:22.559 align:start position:0%
Heber um I've been up here before and so
 
01:05:24.190 --> 01:05:24.200 align:start position:0%
I think you already know that I'm
 
01:05:28.390 --> 01:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
opposed to cryptocurrency as its entity
 
01:05:32.950 --> 01:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
uh in this particular case um the the
 
01:05:36.470 --> 01:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
idea is to install or pass legislation
 
01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:37.390 align:start position:0%
idea is to install or pass legislation
to

01:05:37.390 --> 01:05:37.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:05:41.710 --> 01:05:41.720 align:start position:0%
regulate what uh inevitably will be
 
01:05:44.230 --> 01:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency and as a result of that
 
01:05:48.109 --> 01:05:48.119 align:start position:0%
we made a decision for the entire state
 
01:05:48.119 --> 01:05:49.150 align:start position:0%
we made a decision for the entire state
that

01:05:49.150 --> 01:05:49.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:05:52.549 --> 01:05:52.559 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency is going to be uh
 
01:05:55.309 --> 01:05:55.319 align:start position:0%
allowed embraced
 
01:05:57.710 --> 01:05:57.720 align:start position:0%
and I know for a fact that most people
 
01:06:00.349 --> 01:06:00.359 align:start position:0%
have no idea what that
 
01:06:03.269 --> 01:06:03.279 align:start position:0%
means and so as a result I uh I'm here
 
01:06:06.150 --> 01:06:06.160 align:start position:0%
to point out just a few characteristics
 
01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:07.549 align:start position:0%
to point out just a few characteristics
of

01:06:07.549 --> 01:06:07.559 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:06:07.559 --> 01:06:10.150 align:start position:0%
of
crypto

01:06:10.150 --> 01:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
crypto
 
01:06:12.789 --> 01:06:12.799 align:start position:0%
um this is one of many parts of a
 
01:06:15.390 --> 01:06:15.400 align:start position:0%
concerted effort to create a crypto
 
01:06:17.789 --> 01:06:17.799 align:start position:0%
ecology in New
 
01:06:21.510 --> 01:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:24.190 --> 01:06:24.200 align:start position:0%
legislature the legislature has not been
 
01:06:26.470 --> 01:06:26.480 align:start position:0%
sufficiently educated on what the E this
 
01:06:29.390 --> 01:06:29.400 align:start position:0%
ecology is the crypto environment
 
01:06:32.670 --> 01:06:32.680 align:start position:0%
nationally has caused many negative
 
01:06:35.190 --> 01:06:35.200 align:start position:0%
externalities and uh and I'm I'm
 
01:06:36.470 --> 01:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
referring to
 
01:06:38.549 --> 01:06:38.559 align:start position:0%
fraud uh in
 
01:06:41.349 --> 01:06:41.359 align:start position:0%
particular including fraud and literally
 
01:06:44.710 --> 01:06:44.720 align:start position:0%
billions of dollars in losses to
 
01:06:47.269 --> 01:06:47.279 align:start position:0%
shareholders many informed and famous
 
01:06:50.910 --> 01:06:50.920 align:start position:0%
investors consider this system to be
 
01:06:53.630 --> 01:06:53.640 align:start position:0%
unstable among them are Charles M the
 
01:06:55.349 --> 01:06:55.359 align:start position:0%
late Charles
 
01:06:59.589 --> 01:06:59.599 align:start position:0%
merer um Warren
 
01:07:02.150 --> 01:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
Buffett of Berkshire hathway both of
 
01:07:04.510 --> 01:07:04.520 align:start position:0%
those are Berkshire hathway and Jamie
 
01:07:08.589 --> 01:07:08.599 align:start position:0%
Diamond CEO of JP Morgan Chase Munger
 
01:07:11.589 --> 01:07:11.599 align:start position:0%
said cryptos will eventually become
 
01:07:14.230 --> 01:07:14.240 align:start position:0%
worthless while Buffett considers crypto
 
01:07:17.950 --> 01:07:17.960 align:start position:0%
to be nothing more than a gambling token
 
01:07:20.549 --> 01:07:20.559 align:start position:0%
other words it has transactional value
 
01:07:23.950 --> 01:07:23.960 align:start position:0%
but not intrinsic value there is no
 
01:07:28.870 --> 01:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
intrinsic uh property yet that is uh
 
01:07:31.510 --> 01:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
recognized as it would be if it was a
 
01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:33.470 align:start position:0%
recognized as it would be if it was a
legitimate

01:07:33.470 --> 01:07:33.480 align:start position:0%
legitimate
 
01:07:37.950 --> 01:07:37.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:39.950 --> 01:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
me okay thank
 
01:07:43.630 --> 01:07:43.640 align:start position:0%
you uh Diamond uh said uh buying crypto
 
01:07:45.549 --> 01:07:45.559 align:start position:0%
is like buying a pet
 
01:07:48.269 --> 01:07:48.279 align:start position:0%
rock the majority believe crypto's
 
01:07:48.279 --> 01:07:50.710 align:start position:0%
rock the majority believe crypto's
Providence

01:07:50.710 --> 01:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
Providence
 
01:07:53.589 --> 01:07:53.599 align:start position:0%
is is a money laundering tool for
 
01:07:56.029 --> 01:07:56.039 align:start position:0%
internet AAL illegal
 
01:08:00.309 --> 01:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
cabals and considers uh and and
 
01:08:04.309 --> 01:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
cheats the majority believes okay among
 
01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:08.720 align:start position:0%
the responsibilities of the Commerce
 
01:08:11.630 --> 01:08:11.640 align:start position:0%
Committee is to protect citizens to
 
01:08:15.109 --> 01:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
protect citizens from Consumer Fraud and
 
01:08:18.550 --> 01:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
the like crypto's Providence and
 
01:08:21.110 --> 01:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
difficulties clearly show that this
 
01:08:23.510 --> 01:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
system should not be endorsed in any
 
01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:24.829 align:start position:0%
system should not be endorsed in any
shape

01:08:24.829 --> 01:08:24.839 align:start position:0%
shape
 
01:08:30.990 --> 01:08:31.000 align:start position:0%
perform and as a former marilin broker I
 
01:08:35.349 --> 01:08:35.359 align:start position:0%
can tell you unequivocally that the
 
01:08:39.829 --> 01:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency is considered far far out
 
01:08:44.110 --> 01:08:44.120 align:start position:0%
on the risk curve in other words I would
 
01:08:46.269 --> 01:08:46.279 align:start position:0%
as a broker I would have never
 
01:08:50.550 --> 01:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
recommended a customer invest any money
 
01:08:54.870 --> 01:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
in in such a risky risky piece of paper
 
01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:58.430 align:start position:0%
in in such a risky risky piece of paper
and

01:08:58.430 --> 01:08:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:01.669 --> 01:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
finally it's Commerce and consumer
 
01:09:04.870 --> 01:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
affairs so in other words not only do we
 
01:09:07.590 --> 01:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
deal with insurance and and Banking and
 
01:09:10.269 --> 01:09:10.279 align:start position:0%
and those uh kinds of subjects but it is
 
01:09:10.279 --> 01:09:11.590 align:start position:0%
and those uh kinds of subjects but it is
Our

01:09:11.590 --> 01:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
Our
 
01:09:15.030 --> 01:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
obligation to um
 
01:09:17.070 --> 01:09:17.080 align:start position:0%
protect our
 
01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
constituents from taking a major risk
 
01:09:24.189 --> 01:09:24.199 align:start position:0%
that they may not understand exact exact
 
01:09:26.910 --> 01:09:26.920 align:start position:0%
exists now you can go to a casino and
 
01:09:28.430 --> 01:09:28.440 align:start position:0%
make a
 
01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
killing right but if everybody did it
 
01:09:32.870 --> 01:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
there would be no
 
01:09:35.829 --> 01:09:35.839 align:start position:0%
casinos so the fact of the matter
 
01:09:39.030 --> 01:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
is U and finally the last thing I'll say
 
01:09:41.390 --> 01:09:41.400 align:start position:0%
is that the uh legitimate
 
01:09:44.709 --> 01:09:44.719 align:start position:0%
currencies uh also trade but they have
 
01:09:48.510 --> 01:09:48.520 align:start position:0%
uh more than transactional value but
 
01:09:50.990 --> 01:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
um cryptocurrency and I don't know if
 
01:09:53.149 --> 01:09:53.159 align:start position:0%
you've followed the gyration and the
 
01:09:56.510 --> 01:09:56.520 align:start position:0%
price of this this outfit but uh is 10
 
01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
times 10 times as volatile as legitimate
 
01:10:03.790 --> 01:10:03.800 align:start position:0%
currencies so with all those
 
01:10:07.470 --> 01:10:07.480 align:start position:0%
difficulties I think it's my obligation
 
01:10:10.830 --> 01:10:10.840 align:start position:0%
to uh not vote to
 
01:10:14.790 --> 01:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
endorse uh such a volatile risky
 
01:10:17.149 --> 01:10:17.159 align:start position:0%
investment uh and so as a result of that
 
01:10:21.110 --> 01:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
I would hope to uh that you would see it
 
01:10:25.030 --> 01:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
my way and uh avoid the chance that some
 
01:10:26.630 --> 01:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
of your constituents are going to lose a
 
01:10:31.590 --> 01:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:34.350 --> 01:10:34.360 align:start position:0%
collapses thank
 
01:10:37.830 --> 01:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
you should I do a I like a a vote and do
 
01:10:40.950 --> 01:10:40.960 align:start position:0%
I want to take a uh not a roll call vote
 
01:10:44.510 --> 01:10:44.520 align:start position:0%
but uh just an up and down
 
01:10:48.870 --> 01:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
vote huh yeah division vote you want a
 
01:10:51.669 --> 01:10:51.679 align:start position:0%
division yes sir
 
01:10:54.590 --> 01:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
okay all right you want a division okay
 
01:10:58.470 --> 01:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:01.990 --> 01:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
hun all right thank you Mr Speaker so Mr
 
01:11:03.790 --> 01:11:03.800 align:start position:0%
Speaker I'm really proud to say that
 
01:11:05.669 --> 01:11:05.679 align:start position:0%
this is a something the study committees
 
01:11:07.510 --> 01:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
have been working very hard on in
 
01:11:09.750 --> 01:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
Commerce and puts this out on the
 
01:11:13.990 --> 01:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
Forefront of not
 
01:11:17.310 --> 01:11:17.320 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency it is blockchain but this
 
01:11:19.070 --> 01:11:19.080 align:start position:0%
is something a little bit different this
 
01:11:20.950 --> 01:11:20.960 align:start position:0%
is corporate
 
01:11:24.310 --> 01:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
structure so you all remember LL LC's
 
01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
right well before llc's there was sub
 
01:11:29.790 --> 01:11:29.800 align:start position:0%
chapter S in this case what we're doing
 
01:11:32.189 --> 01:11:32.199 align:start position:0%
today is going to
 
01:11:35.310 --> 01:11:35.320 align:start position:0%
revolutionalize way someone can create a
 
01:11:38.030 --> 01:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
business a corporation and instead of
 
01:11:41.550 --> 01:11:41.560 align:start position:0%
having u a board of directors and have a
 
01:11:44.030 --> 01:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
uh firm structure that most corporations
 
01:11:46.550 --> 01:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
have now we're going to use the
 
01:11:48.870 --> 01:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency excuse me blockchain
 
01:11:53.110 --> 01:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
concept to build a company around that
 
01:11:55.470 --> 01:11:55.480 align:start position:0%
organiz ations of all those members
 
01:11:59.030 --> 01:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
working together it's open system so
 
01:12:00.910 --> 01:12:00.920 align:start position:0%
anybody can see exactly how they're
 
01:12:04.110 --> 01:12:04.120 align:start position:0%
doing it it's uh monitored uh by
 
01:12:06.390 --> 01:12:06.400 align:start position:0%
actually the Secretary of State uh as
 
01:12:08.669 --> 01:12:08.679 align:start position:0%
which does all our corporations now will
 
01:12:12.189 --> 01:12:12.199 align:start position:0%
be able to uh monitor it and recognize
 
01:12:15.470 --> 01:12:15.480 align:start position:0%
what it's doing Dr is uh very excited
 
01:12:17.629 --> 01:12:17.639 align:start position:0%
about it because they see all kinds of
 
01:12:19.510 --> 01:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
new opportunities to bring in new
 
01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:21.280 align:start position:0%
revenues because people are going to
 
01:12:23.709 --> 01:12:23.719 align:start position:0%
want to come here to come to New
 
01:12:26.430 --> 01:12:26.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to create one of these why
 
01:12:27.990 --> 01:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
would they want to come here well
 
01:12:29.310 --> 01:12:29.320 align:start position:0%
because these things are already
 
01:12:31.350 --> 01:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
happening already now across the country
 
01:12:34.390 --> 01:12:34.400 align:start position:0%
these Dows but they are
 
01:12:36.750 --> 01:12:36.760 align:start position:0%
unregulated the idea that you could
 
01:12:39.750 --> 01:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
create one that was regulated by a state
 
01:12:43.229 --> 01:12:43.239 align:start position:0%
that had governance it had guard rails
 
01:12:45.030 --> 01:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
this is the most exciting thing we have
 
01:12:46.550 --> 01:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
done in Commerce in the last couple
 
01:12:48.270 --> 01:12:48.280 align:start position:0%
years since since we passed the trust
 
01:12:51.470 --> 01:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
law so I'm very happy to say that that I
 
01:12:53.149 --> 01:12:53.159 align:start position:0%
think everyone wants to be in support of
 
01:12:56.629 --> 01:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
this bill so thank you and and let's be
 
01:12:58.870 --> 01:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
very proud that we got this accomplished
 
01:13:00.350 --> 01:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
thank you does the member yield a
 
01:13:04.270 --> 01:13:04.280 align:start position:0%
questions sir member
 
01:13:06.750 --> 01:13:06.760 align:start position:0%

Speaker I rise today against the ought

to pass motion for this legislation this
 
01:21:26.870 --> 01:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
bill we got last year in the committee
 
01:21:29.229 --> 01:21:29.239 align:start position:0%
and was retained for a study committee
 
01:21:31.149 --> 01:21:31.159 align:start position:0%
that was chaired by my friend from
 
01:21:34.550 --> 01:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
chesher and my friend from chesher went
 
01:21:37.350 --> 01:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
through very diligently with police
 
01:21:40.070 --> 01:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
standards and training and director
 
01:21:43.790 --> 01:21:43.800 align:start position:0%
Skipper going over this bill going over
 
01:21:46.830 --> 01:21:46.840 align:start position:0%
line by line how best we could approach
 
01:21:49.070 --> 01:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
train changing the training standards
 
01:21:52.070 --> 01:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
for our police officers cuz we recognize
 
01:21:54.030 --> 01:21:54.040 align:start position:0%
that the int intent of the sponsor of
 
01:21:56.910 --> 01:21:56.920 align:start position:0%
this bill is well put there is a serious
 
01:21:59.310 --> 01:21:59.320 align:start position:0%
issue with retainment a serious issue
 
01:22:02.390 --> 01:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
with recruitment but I believe that
 
01:22:05.510 --> 01:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
solving that issue is not done by
 
01:22:07.990 --> 01:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
lowering the standards we can solve that
 
01:22:10.950 --> 01:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
issue by actually paying our police
 
01:22:13.950 --> 01:22:13.960 align:start position:0%
officers a decent wage and giving them
 
01:22:16.910 --> 01:22:16.920 align:start position:0%
livable working conditions so I think if
 
01:22:19.350 --> 01:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
you're a police officer who's trying to
 
01:22:21.629 --> 01:22:21.639 align:start position:0%
catch a per if you're a police officer
 
01:22:24.430 --> 01:22:24.440 align:start position:0%
who's going into a school or a or trying
 
01:22:27.070 --> 01:22:27.080 align:start position:0%
to address something going on in the
 
01:22:29.390 --> 01:22:29.400 align:start position:0%
community I think if you have backup
 
01:22:31.390 --> 01:22:31.400 align:start position:0%
you'd like that backup to be able to run
 
01:22:33.790 --> 01:22:33.800 align:start position:0%
with you to be able to keep up to be
 
01:22:37.830 --> 01:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
able to stay fit and active we have
 
01:22:39.750 --> 01:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
Fitness requirements mental requirements
 
01:22:42.149 --> 01:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
for Pilots we wouldn't want our pilot
 
01:22:45.390 --> 01:22:45.400 align:start position:0%
not to be physically or mentally fit we
 
01:22:48.310 --> 01:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
have requirements yearly for teachers
 
01:22:49.750 --> 01:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
they have to do workshops we wouldn't
 
01:22:51.430 --> 01:22:51.440 align:start position:0%
want our teachers not to be able to do
 
01:22:53.189 --> 01:22:53.199 align:start position:0%
their jobs we have requirements for
 
01:22:55.390 --> 01:22:55.400 align:start position:0%
train Engineers we wouldn't want them to
 
01:22:57.709 --> 01:22:57.719 align:start position:0%
be able to do a TR to run the train
 
01:22:59.510 --> 01:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
which is itself on a track so why would
 
01:23:02.070 --> 01:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
we not have requirements for police
 
01:23:04.310 --> 01:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
officers who do the job of protecting
 
01:23:06.510 --> 01:23:06.520 align:start position:0%
our community and if we go back to our
 
01:23:08.510 --> 01:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
communities and say hey guys we just
 
01:23:10.590 --> 01:23:10.600 align:start position:0%
lower the standards for cops anyone can
 
01:23:12.270 --> 01:23:12.280 align:start position:0%
become a cop you don't have to take the
 
01:23:14.709 --> 01:23:14.719 align:start position:0%
test then I think we would be we would
 
01:23:16.669 --> 01:23:16.679 align:start position:0%
be failing them you know we we police
 
01:23:19.110 --> 01:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
officers should be fit they should be
 
01:23:20.750 --> 01:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
active and they that's how we can
 
01:23:22.270 --> 01:23:22.280 align:start position:0%
protect our communities here so if we
 
01:23:23.790 --> 01:23:23.800 align:start position:0%
want to address the retention and the
 
01:23:26.669 --> 01:23:26.679 align:start position:0%
pay issue which my friend
 
01:23:29.149 --> 01:23:29.159 align:start position:0%
is totally correct we should address
 
01:23:31.510 --> 01:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
that issue let's come together and try
 
01:23:33.350 --> 01:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
to find some way to pay them more and
 
01:23:34.750 --> 01:23:34.760 align:start position:0%
make their conditions better because
 
01:23:37.070 --> 01:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
they do a terribly hard job that is a
 
01:23:39.070 --> 01:23:39.080 align:start position:0%
terribly hard task and being fit
 
01:23:41.189 --> 01:23:41.199 align:start position:0%
requires to do that job so thank you Mr
 
01:23:42.870 --> 01:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
Speaker and I would ask that you vote
 
01:23:44.830 --> 01:23:44.840 align:start position:0%
against the a toass motion so another
 
01:23:46.550 --> 01:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
motion could be
 
01:23:48.950 --> 01:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
made chair recognizes representative
 
01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:51.470 align:start position:0%
made chair recognizes representative

01:23:53.590 --> 01:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
Manion
 
01:23:56.310 --> 01:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker I rise
 
01:23:59.030 --> 01:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
in support of House Bill 113 I've been
 
01:24:00.910 --> 01:24:00.920 align:start position:0%
in law enforcement for 30 years so I was
 
01:24:02.950 --> 01:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
a part of law enforcement before this
 
01:24:05.189 --> 01:24:05.199 align:start position:0%
law went to effect and after it went
 
01:24:07.709 --> 01:24:07.719 align:start position:0%
into effect um it was my understanding
 
01:24:09.310 --> 01:24:09.320 align:start position:0%
back then that it was put in place to
 
01:24:11.270 --> 01:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
reduce workman's comp claims for
 
01:24:13.030 --> 01:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
injuries however no evidence was
 
01:24:16.110 --> 01:24:16.120 align:start position:0%
presented to us at all that was the case
 
01:24:18.030 --> 01:24:18.040 align:start position:0%
I'll stop by saying this this bill does
 
01:24:19.629 --> 01:24:19.639 align:start position:0%
not eliminate the police standards and
 
01:24:21.550 --> 01:24:21.560 align:start position:0%
training council's physical fitness
 
01:24:22.790 --> 01:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
training requirements for law
 
01:24:24.510 --> 01:24:24.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement offices it does not
 
01:24:27.350 --> 01:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
eliminate it what this bill does do it
 
01:24:29.270 --> 01:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
repeals a law that was enacted 20 plus
 
01:24:31.669 --> 01:24:31.679 align:start position:0%
years ago that also requires that the
 
01:24:33.550 --> 01:24:33.560 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officer Contin
 
01:24:35.270 --> 01:24:35.280 align:start position:0%
continuously pass this physical fitness
 
01:24:37.910 --> 01:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
standard every three years during his or
 
01:24:40.350 --> 01:24:40.360 align:start position:0%
her career what's the issue with that
 
01:24:42.149 --> 01:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
you might ask first it hurts Recruitment
 
01:24:44.709 --> 01:24:44.719 align:start position:0%
and Retention of experienced officers
 
01:24:47.030 --> 01:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
contrary to what it might have been said
 
01:24:48.070 --> 01:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of towns right now
 
01:24:50.709 --> 01:24:50.719 align:start position:0%
offering sign on bonuses so 15 20
 
01:24:52.709 --> 01:24:52.719 align:start position:0%
$30,000 and that's still not bringing
 
01:24:54.990 --> 01:24:55.000 align:start position:0%
people in it's not about the
 
01:24:57.390 --> 01:24:57.400 align:start position:0%
money in addition New Hampshire has
 
01:24:58.990 --> 01:24:59.000 align:start position:0%
always been a place where officers who
 
01:25:01.229 --> 01:25:01.239 align:start position:0%
retired from neighboring states would
 
01:25:03.390 --> 01:25:03.400 align:start position:0%
come to work often as police Chiefs in
 
01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:04.430 align:start position:0%
come to work often as police Chiefs in
small

01:25:04.430 --> 01:25:04.440 align:start position:0%
small
 
01:25:07.270 --> 01:25:07.280 align:start position:0%
towns that is years of experience in
 
01:25:09.709 --> 01:25:09.719 align:start position:0%
training we are potentially losing due
 
01:25:11.270 --> 01:25:11.280 align:start position:0%
to this law because they don't want to
 
01:25:13.350 --> 01:25:13.360 align:start position:0%
come to New Hampshire in their 40s and
 
01:25:14.709 --> 01:25:14.719 align:start position:0%
50s and have to do these physical
 
01:25:19.629 --> 01:25:19.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:23.310 --> 01:25:23.320 align:start position:0%
years most of the uh people like
 
01:25:25.950 --> 01:25:25.960 align:start position:0%
lieutenants captains and police Chiefs
 
01:25:27.390 --> 01:25:27.400 align:start position:0%
uh they might be the kind of people who
 
01:25:29.430 --> 01:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
go to the gym three to five days a week
 
01:25:30.910 --> 01:25:30.920 align:start position:0%
but these are the kind of people who
 
01:25:32.950 --> 01:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
retire as soon as they're able to
 
01:25:34.950 --> 01:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
causing agencies to lose years of
 
01:25:37.030 --> 01:25:37.040 align:start position:0%
experience or in the case of officers
 
01:25:38.590 --> 01:25:38.600 align:start position:0%
who retired from another state they
 
01:25:41.229 --> 01:25:41.239 align:start position:0%
would not choose New Hampshire at all
 
01:25:43.109 --> 01:25:43.119 align:start position:0%
again years of experience and training
 
01:25:45.310 --> 01:25:45.320 align:start position:0%
that we are losing keep in mind that
 
01:25:46.310 --> 01:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
there are many different types of
 
01:25:48.390 --> 01:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
assignments in law enforcement not all
 
01:25:50.910 --> 01:25:50.920 align:start position:0%
of them require top physical fitness
 
01:25:53.590 --> 01:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
standards if you're on a SWAT team per
 
01:25:56.830 --> 01:25:56.840 align:start position:0%
se and uh they have their own strict
 
01:25:58.790 --> 01:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
standards in order to be on that part of
 
01:26:00.629 --> 01:26:00.639 align:start position:0%
that team you have to pass those so the
 
01:26:03.629 --> 01:26:03.639 align:start position:0%
the people who need to be physically fit
 
01:26:05.990 --> 01:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
are remaining physically
 
01:26:07.870 --> 01:26:07.880 align:start position:0%
fit if you're a person who's
 
01:26:09.550 --> 01:26:09.560 align:start position:0%
investigating fatal motor vehicle
 
01:26:11.669 --> 01:26:11.679 align:start position:0%
accidents or crime scenes white Coller
 
01:26:14.629 --> 01:26:14.639 align:start position:0%
crimes or computer crimes that expertise
 
01:26:15.590 --> 01:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
is still
 
01:26:17.550 --> 01:26:17.560 align:start position:0%
needed in a profession that is
 
01:26:19.229 --> 01:26:19.239 align:start position:0%
struggling to fill positions we should
 
01:26:21.189 --> 01:26:21.199 align:start position:0%
not be pushing out our most experienced
 
01:26:23.950 --> 01:26:23.960 align:start position:0%
officers second New Hampshire is the
 
01:26:25.750 --> 01:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
only state in the country that has this
 
01:26:29.109 --> 01:26:29.119 align:start position:0%
law the only state and only for law
 
01:26:30.790 --> 01:26:30.800 align:start position:0%
enforcement offices we don't require it
 
01:26:34.030 --> 01:26:34.040 align:start position:0%
of our fighter fighters or our EMTs or
 
01:26:36.510 --> 01:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
our teachers that I know of this is a
 
01:26:38.430 --> 01:26:38.440 align:start position:0%
mandate imposed by the state however law
 
01:26:39.950 --> 01:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers are not paid to
 
01:26:42.149 --> 01:26:42.159 align:start position:0%
work out in preparation for the
 
01:26:44.669 --> 01:26:44.679 align:start position:0%
three-year physical fitness not only are
 
01:26:46.950 --> 01:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
they not paid but if they injured while
 
01:26:49.109 --> 01:26:49.119 align:start position:0%
preparing for this test they are not
 
01:26:51.189 --> 01:26:51.199 align:start position:0%
likely to be covered by workman's
 
01:26:51.199 --> 01:26:53.270 align:start position:0%
likely to be covered by workman's
comp

01:26:53.270 --> 01:26:53.280 align:start position:0%
comp
 
01:26:55.470 --> 01:26:55.480 align:start position:0%
fourth the state uses a Cooper standard
 
01:26:57.750 --> 01:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
and that testing is outdated I have
 
01:26:59.149 --> 01:26:59.159 align:start position:0%
spoken to quite a few officers and
 
01:27:01.310 --> 01:27:01.320 align:start position:0%
police Chiefs in and around my district
 
01:27:02.870 --> 01:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
who feel that they this should be done
 
01:27:05.270 --> 01:27:05.280 align:start position:0%
on a local level a lot of towns and
 
01:27:06.830 --> 01:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
cities already have yearly incentive
 
01:27:09.390 --> 01:27:09.400 align:start position:0%
based physical fitness requirements and
 
01:27:10.870 --> 01:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
it rewards an officer who completes it
 
01:27:13.669 --> 01:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
with a stipend the Chiefs I spoke with
 
01:27:15.629 --> 01:27:15.639 align:start position:0%
would also like local control over their
 
01:27:18.030 --> 01:27:18.040 align:start position:0%
own agency with the ability to create a
 
01:27:20.910 --> 01:27:20.920 align:start position:0%
more realistic testing process and
 
01:27:23.030 --> 01:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
finally the penalty fulfilling this
 
01:27:25.510 --> 01:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
requirement is severe if you miss a mile
 
01:27:28.030 --> 01:27:28.040 align:start position:0%
and a half run by a few seconds or a few
 
01:27:30.510 --> 01:27:30.520 align:start position:0%
sit-ups or a few push-ups short you lose
 
01:27:33.189 --> 01:27:33.199 align:start position:0%
your certification you lose your career
 
01:27:34.350 --> 01:27:34.360 align:start position:0%
and you can't work in New Hampshire
 
01:27:36.669 --> 01:27:36.679 align:start position:0%
anymore let's repeal the state mandate
 
01:27:38.790 --> 01:27:38.800 align:start position:0%
and return local control to our towns
 
01:27:41.030 --> 01:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
and cities who know best about what they
 
01:27:42.830 --> 01:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
require of our local law enforcement
 
01:27:45.870 --> 01:27:45.880 align:start position:0%

Speaker if I know that Fitness
 
01:29:32.430 --> 01:29:32.440 align:start position:0%
requirements in law enforcement such as
 
01:29:34.629 --> 01:29:34.639 align:start position:0%
currently exis in New Hampshire are
 
01:29:37.470 --> 01:29:37.480 align:start position:0%
consistent across the state are directly
 
01:29:38.870 --> 01:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
related to the ability of Law
 
01:29:42.149 --> 01:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
Enforcement Officers to perform the
 
01:29:44.510 --> 01:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
essential functions of their jobs and
 
01:29:46.189 --> 01:29:46.199 align:start position:0%
are important to help distinguish
 
01:29:48.669 --> 01:29:48.679 align:start position:0%
between those who can and cannot meet
 
01:29:48.679 --> 01:29:50.070 align:start position:0%
between those who can and cannot meet

employment
 
01:29:52.550 --> 01:29:52.560 align:start position:0%
expectations and if I know
 
01:29:55.109 --> 01:29:55.119 align:start position:0%
the testimony provided to the committee
 
01:29:56.950 --> 01:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
indicated that the New Hampshire Chiefs
 
01:29:59.910 --> 01:29:59.920 align:start position:0%
of police could not attain consensus on
 
01:30:02.149 --> 01:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
this bill and have chosen to remain
 
01:30:04.149 --> 01:30:04.159 align:start position:0%
neutral on its
 
01:30:06.950 --> 01:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
disposition and finally if I know that
 
01:30:08.510 --> 01:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
repealing New Hampshire's physical
 
01:30:10.910 --> 01:30:10.920 align:start position:0%
fitness requirements for law enforcement
 
01:30:13.229 --> 01:30:13.239 align:start position:0%
officers rather than moving to a
 
01:30:15.629 --> 01:30:15.639 align:start position:0%
different kind of test or Fitness
 
01:30:18.750 --> 01:30:18.760 align:start position:0%
standard as John shippa director of New
 
01:30:20.229 --> 01:30:20.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire police standard and training
 
01:30:22.830 --> 01:30:22.840 align:start position:0%
Council has stated he is open to
 
01:30:24.629 --> 01:30:24.639 align:start position:0%
could lead to an increase in positive
 
01:30:27.990 --> 01:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
negative outcomes then would I now press
 
01:30:30.629 --> 01:30:30.639 align:start position:0%
the red button to vote no and allow New
 
01:30:32.430 --> 01:30:32.440 align:start position:0%

Dennis Manion for a parliamentary
 
01:30:54.109 --> 01:30:54.119 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
01:30:55.550 --> 01:30:55.560 align:start position:0%
find out that this bill does not
 
01:30:57.669 --> 01:30:57.679 align:start position:0%
eliminate the standard uh training
 
01:30:59.030 --> 01:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
physical fitness requirements to become
 
01:31:00.950 --> 01:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
a certified police officer it only
 
01:31:03.470 --> 01:31:03.480 align:start position:0%
repeals a law requiring officers to pass
 
01:31:05.910 --> 01:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
this standard every 3 years after that
 
01:31:07.870 --> 01:31:07.880 align:start position:0%
and if I know the law hurts Recruitment
 
01:31:09.910 --> 01:31:09.920 align:start position:0%
and Retention of experienced offices in
 
01:31:12.149 --> 01:31:12.159 align:start position:0%
a profession that is struggling to fill
 
01:31:14.149 --> 01:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
positions and if I know that New
 
01:31:15.870 --> 01:31:15.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is the only state in the
 
01:31:18.229 --> 01:31:18.239 align:start position:0%
country that has this law and it only
 
01:31:20.669 --> 01:31:20.679 align:start position:0%
applies to law enforcement officers and
 
01:31:22.790 --> 01:31:22.800 align:start position:0%
if I know that officers not paid to work
 
01:31:24.270 --> 01:31:24.280 align:start position:0%
out in preparation for this three-year
 
01:31:26.669 --> 01:31:26.679 align:start position:0%
physical fitness test and if I know that
 
01:31:28.270 --> 01:31:28.280 align:start position:0%
the penalty for failing this requirement
 
01:31:30.229 --> 01:31:30.239 align:start position:0%
is losing your certification therefore
 
01:31:32.590 --> 01:31:32.600 align:start position:0%

Year the amendments in your pocket it's
 
01:35:44.550 --> 01:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
two lines long it's very short but since
 
01:35:46.470 --> 01:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
it's removing something I want to point
 
01:35:49.149 --> 01:35:49.159 align:start position:0%
you to the calendar where it is it's on
 
01:35:52.070 --> 01:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
page 78 it removes
 
01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:54.550 align:start position:0%
page 78 it removes
one

01:35:54.550 --> 01:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:56.870 --> 01:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
definition um and the definition is
 
01:35:59.390 --> 01:35:59.400 align:start position:0%
relative to harm
 
01:36:01.310 --> 01:36:01.320 align:start position:0%
reduction I don't sit on criminal
 
01:36:03.350 --> 01:36:03.360 align:start position:0%
justice I sit on house finance we had a
 
01:36:04.990 --> 01:36:05.000 align:start position:0%
lot of discussions in house finance
 
01:36:07.750 --> 01:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
regarding harm reduction it's a term
 
01:36:09.430 --> 01:36:09.440 align:start position:0%
that's not necessary for this bill to
 
01:36:11.870 --> 01:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
proceed forward it's a term that was
 
01:36:14.709 --> 01:36:14.719 align:start position:0%
included in a definition that doesn't
 
01:36:17.950 --> 01:36:17.960 align:start position:0%
impact this legislation at all the
 
01:36:20.310 --> 01:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
amendment simply removes that additional
 
01:36:22.709 --> 01:36:22.719 align:start position:0%
definition that was incl uded in the
 
01:36:25.790 --> 01:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
bill so that we can go ahead and deal
 
01:36:27.310 --> 01:36:27.320 align:start position:0%
with the fentanyl test strips which is
 
01:36:28.990 --> 01:36:29.000 align:start position:0%
the thing that we want to get passed I
 
01:36:31.030 --> 01:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
would ask that you would adopt Amendment
 
01:36:38.310 --> 01:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:50.270 --> 01:36:50.280 align:start position:0%

01:36:57.830 --> 01:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:01.430 --> 01:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker sorry about that um
 
01:37:03.270 --> 01:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
just wanted to speak also on the same
 
01:37:04.109 --> 01:37:04.119 align:start position:0%
thing you already know what the
 
01:37:06.790 --> 01:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
amendment is about um what did I learn
 
01:37:10.229 --> 01:37:10.239 align:start position:0%
in the last year in this body um one of
 
01:37:12.830 --> 01:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
the things that I did in my work for 35
 
01:37:15.390 --> 01:37:15.400 align:start position:0%
years as advocating for the rights of
 
01:37:18.189 --> 01:37:18.199 align:start position:0%
people in pain and seeking for um
 
01:37:20.510 --> 01:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
balance between public policy between
 
01:37:22.870 --> 01:37:22.880 align:start position:0%
those in pain and those who suffer from
 
01:37:25.310 --> 01:37:25.320 align:start position:0%
addiction um is that the concept of harm
 
01:37:27.830 --> 01:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
reduction is extremely important it's
 
01:37:30.709 --> 01:37:30.719 align:start position:0%
extremely complicated I spent the last
 
01:37:33.390 --> 01:37:33.400 align:start position:0%
um year talking to people on both sides
 
01:37:36.229 --> 01:37:36.239 align:start position:0%
of this body both within and without
 
01:37:38.910 --> 01:37:38.920 align:start position:0%
about this and what I learned was that
 
01:37:41.270 --> 01:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
it's a complex subject that defies
 
01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:42.310 align:start position:0%
it's a complex subject that defies
simple

01:37:42.310 --> 01:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
simple
 
01:37:45.470 --> 01:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
definition um
 
01:37:47.990 --> 01:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
um I talked with the regional director
 
01:37:50.189 --> 01:37:50.199 align:start position:0%
of samsa substance abuse mental health
 
01:37:52.149 --> 01:37:52.159 align:start position:0%
Service Agency who's our regional
 
01:37:54.350 --> 01:37:54.360 align:start position:0%
director as well as that of the Midwest
 
01:37:56.390 --> 01:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
um she pointed out a definition that
 
01:37:58.149 --> 01:37:58.159 align:start position:0%
they just released to me it is more than
 
01:38:02.550 --> 01:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
10 pages long um the concern though then
 
01:38:04.629 --> 01:38:04.639 align:start position:0%
is when you create Simplicity out of
 
01:38:06.390 --> 01:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
complexity you lose the value of what
 
01:38:08.629 --> 01:38:08.639 align:start position:0%
you're talking about and that's what
 
01:38:10.430 --> 01:38:10.440 align:start position:0%
this definition does it's overly
 
01:38:12.390 --> 01:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
simplistic and by definition it will
 
01:38:14.550 --> 01:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
create the a potential for unintended
 
01:38:16.510 --> 01:38:16.520 align:start position:0%
consequences that can be somewhat
 
01:38:18.669 --> 01:38:18.679 align:start position:0%
problematic and that's why we asked that
 
01:38:21.430 --> 01:38:21.440 align:start position:0%
it be removed from this bill and as the
 
01:38:23.470 --> 01:38:23.480 align:start position:0%
representative mentioned um it does not
 
01:38:25.750 --> 01:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
affect the Bill's content otherwise
 
01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:27.270 align:start position:0%
affect the Bill's content otherwise
thank

01:38:27.270 --> 01:38:27.280 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:38:34.830 --> 01:38:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:39.350 --> 01:38:39.360 align:start position:0%
Muse thank you Mr Speaker we spent uh a
 
01:38:44.109 --> 01:38:44.119 align:start position:0%
considerable time in committee on HB 470
 
01:38:45.950 --> 01:38:45.960 align:start position:0%
uh we spent a lot of time reviewing our
 
01:38:49.629 --> 01:38:49.639 align:start position:0%
drug paraphernalia Law And while
 
01:38:51.910 --> 01:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
additional changes are are something
 
01:38:55.950 --> 01:38:55.960 align:start position:0%
that I think we can and should consider
 
01:38:59.709 --> 01:38:59.719 align:start position:0%
uh at some point in the future um one of
 
01:39:02.270 --> 01:39:02.280 align:start position:0%
the things that I'd be very much aware
 
01:39:06.350 --> 01:39:06.360 align:start position:0%
of with uh with law like this um is the
 
01:39:08.669 --> 01:39:08.679 align:start position:0%
danger of unintended
 
01:39:11.589 --> 01:39:11.599 align:start position:0%
consequences so during testimony for HP
 
01:39:14.830 --> 01:39:14.840 align:start position:0%
470 uh law enforcement made us aware of
 
01:39:17.070 --> 01:39:17.080 align:start position:0%
things that we weren't aware of and
 
01:39:18.550 --> 01:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
that's why we have testimony in the
 
01:39:20.669 --> 01:39:20.679 align:start position:0%

rhs thank you Mr
 
01:43:19.430 --> 01:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr
 
01:43:21.550 --> 01:43:21.560 align:start position:0%
Speaker we're we're going to be told
 
01:43:24.430 --> 01:43:24.440 align:start position:0%
that HB 570 will save
 
01:43:26.990 --> 01:43:27.000 align:start position:0%
lives and the reality is that this bill
 
01:43:30.589 --> 01:43:30.599 align:start position:0%
goes far beyond allowing the person to
 
01:43:34.070 --> 01:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
have drug testing equipment this bill
 
01:43:36.870 --> 01:43:36.880 align:start position:0%
has devastating unintended consequences
 
01:43:39.510 --> 01:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
that aren't going to be
 
01:43:42.950 --> 01:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
reversible in fact HB 470 will make it
 
01:43:45.390 --> 01:43:45.400 align:start position:0%
legal for a person to possess 10
 
01:43:48.550 --> 01:43:48.560 align:start position:0%
milligrams of an unknown controlled
 
01:43:52.669 --> 01:43:52.679 align:start position:0%
substance for reference 2 mg of fentanyl
 
01:43:54.830 --> 01:43:54.840 align:start position:0%
is considered to be a lethal
 
01:43:59.510 --> 01:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
dose car fentanyl is 100 times more
 
01:44:02.390 --> 01:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
potent than Fentanyl and this bill will
 
01:44:04.550 --> 01:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
allow for
 
01:44:08.030 --> 01:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
500 lethal doses of
 
01:44:11.430 --> 01:44:11.440 align:start position:0%
it additionally carop fetanyl is so
 
01:44:13.870 --> 01:44:13.880 align:start position:0%
toxic that a single grain of it on your
 
01:44:16.750 --> 01:44:16.760 align:start position:0%
bare skin can ca to cause to an overdose
 
01:44:16.760 --> 01:44:18.589 align:start position:0%
bare skin can ca to cause to an overdose
and

01:44:18.589 --> 01:44:18.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:44:22.390 --> 01:44:22.400 align:start position:0%
death if you ask an em T if 10
 
01:44:24.870 --> 01:44:24.880 align:start position:0%
milligrams is considered to be a Teensy
 
01:44:26.950 --> 01:44:26.960 align:start position:0%
weny amount they're going to tell you no
 
01:44:28.470 --> 01:44:28.480 align:start position:0%
cuz I asked
 
01:44:32.109 --> 01:44:32.119 align:start position:0%
them if you find 10 milligrams of what
 
01:44:35.350 --> 01:44:35.360 align:start position:0%
we were told is what's left in the bag
 
01:44:37.390 --> 01:44:37.400 align:start position:0%
after the drugs have already been
 
01:44:39.790 --> 01:44:39.800 align:start position:0%
done chances are good you're going to be
 
01:44:41.390 --> 01:44:41.400 align:start position:0%
concerned that you found 10 milligrams
 
01:44:43.669 --> 01:44:43.679 align:start position:0%
of drugs in your child's
 
01:44:46.350 --> 01:44:46.360 align:start position:0%
room the other thing is we were told
 
01:44:48.470 --> 01:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
this is after the drugs are done so how
 
01:44:52.310 --> 01:44:52.320 align:start position:0%
are you testing if you already the drug
 
01:44:55.589 --> 01:44:55.599 align:start position:0%
this bill kicks the door open for abuse
 
01:44:57.510 --> 01:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
police won't be able to investigate many
 
01:44:59.709 --> 01:44:59.719 align:start position:0%
of the cases the person claims they are
 
01:45:01.229 --> 01:45:01.239 align:start position:0%
engaged in harm reduction won't have to
 
01:45:03.629 --> 01:45:03.639 align:start position:0%
prove that it will stop the police from
 
01:45:05.310 --> 01:45:05.320 align:start position:0%
being able to enforce drug laws and does
 
01:45:08.350 --> 01:45:08.360 align:start position:0%
not allow Pro probation or parole to be
 
01:45:14.070 --> 01:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
enforced we already passed HB 287 that
 
01:45:18.149 --> 01:45:18.159 align:start position:0%
was that was the mechanism for these
 
01:45:19.470 --> 01:45:19.480 align:start position:0%
drugs to be
 
01:45:22.109 --> 01:45:22.119 align:start position:0%
tested with most of the drug dealers
 
01:45:23.990 --> 01:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
adding lethal amounts of medications
 
01:45:25.709 --> 01:45:25.719 align:start position:0%
that are meant to be used for farm
 
01:45:29.229 --> 01:45:29.239 align:start position:0%
animals into the drug Supply there is
 
01:45:32.149 --> 01:45:32.159 align:start position:0%
now more than ever no such thing as a
 
01:45:32.159 --> 01:45:33.430 align:start position:0%
now more than ever no such thing as a
safe

01:45:33.430 --> 01:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
safe
 
01:45:36.790 --> 01:45:36.800 align:start position:0%
experience the only choice we have is to
 
01:45:38.470 --> 01:45:38.480 align:start position:0%
interrupt the drug flow from entering
 
01:45:40.229 --> 01:45:40.239 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire and
 
01:45:44.589 --> 01:45:44.599 align:start position:0%
discourage at every turn not encourage
 
01:45:45.709 --> 01:45:45.719 align:start position:0%
more drug
 
01:45:49.990 --> 01:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
use Mr Speaker HB 470 gives a disturbing
 
01:45:52.589 --> 01:45:52.599 align:start position:0%
false sense of security these reasons
 
01:45:55.669 --> 01:45:55.679 align:start position:0%
alone are enough to vote no on the ought
 
01:45:57.589 --> 01:45:57.599 align:start position:0%
to pass motion so another potion can be
 
01:46:00.430 --> 01:46:00.440 align:start position:0%
made thank you Mr
 
01:46:08.229 --> 01:46:08.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:11.270 --> 01:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
mes thank you Mr
 
01:46:14.070 --> 01:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
Speaker at the end of
 
01:46:19.149 --> 01:46:19.159 align:start position:0%
2023 uh I read an article online that
 
01:46:21.109 --> 01:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
projected the total number of drug
 
01:46:23.950 --> 01:46:23.960 align:start position:0%
overdose deaths in the United States uh
 
01:46:23.960 --> 01:46:24.750 align:start position:0%
overdose deaths in the United States uh
for

01:46:24.750 --> 01:46:24.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:46:27.990 --> 01:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
2023 to be
 
01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:29.510 align:start position:0%
2023 to be
112,000

01:46:29.510 --> 01:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
112,000
 
01:46:32.589 --> 01:46:32.599 align:start position:0%
people so to to basically put a picture
 
01:46:35.669 --> 01:46:35.679 align:start position:0%
around that that's just about the size
 
01:46:37.870 --> 01:46:37.880 align:start position:0%
of the population of
 
01:46:40.109 --> 01:46:40.119 align:start position:0%
Manchester now a lot of us in this room
 
01:46:44.270 --> 01:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
have been here before uh over the years
 
01:46:45.910 --> 01:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
uh We've included things in the budget
 
01:46:49.430 --> 01:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
and we've included uh new programs that
 
01:46:52.350 --> 01:46:52.360 align:start position:0%
actually strengthen and Empower law
 
01:46:55.510 --> 01:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement to enforce our drug laws
 
01:46:58.030 --> 01:46:58.040 align:start position:0%
we've also invested in things like
 
01:47:01.310 --> 01:47:01.320 align:start position:0%
prevention and treatment for people uh
 
01:47:04.109 --> 01:47:04.119 align:start position:0%
who are addicted to drugs and last year
 
01:47:05.589 --> 01:47:05.599 align:start position:0%
one of the really good things that we
 
01:47:08.709 --> 01:47:08.719 align:start position:0%
did was we passed a bill legalizing
 
01:47:11.030 --> 01:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
fentanyl test strips and xylazine test
 
01:47:14.189 --> 01:47:14.199 align:start position:0%
strips those are called drug checking
 
01:47:16.149 --> 01:47:16.159 align:start position:0%
materials and one of the issues that
 
01:47:19.510 --> 01:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
we're having right now is that anytime a
 
01:47:21.629 --> 01:47:21.639 align:start position:0%
new technology comes
 
01:47:24.189 --> 01:47:24.199 align:start position:0%
along we're in a position where we
 
01:47:25.990 --> 01:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
actually have to pass a law to start
 
01:47:28.950 --> 01:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
using it we have fentanyl test strips in
 
01:47:32.750 --> 01:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
our rsas we have xylazine test strips in
 
01:47:36.470 --> 01:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
our in our rsas we have nxone as an
 
01:47:39.709 --> 01:47:39.719 align:start position:0%
opioid reversal agent in our rsas but
 
01:47:43.589 --> 01:47:43.599 align:start position:0%
for us to use other things that are that
 
01:47:45.790 --> 01:47:45.800 align:start position:0%
are basically in development as they
 
01:47:47.550 --> 01:47:47.560 align:start position:0%
come along and to be able to get them
 
01:47:49.510 --> 01:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
out into a situation where they can help
 
01:47:52.189 --> 01:47:52.199 align:start position:0%
people we're sort of caught in this trap
 
01:47:54.790 --> 01:47:54.800 align:start position:0%
where we need to pass a law to do this
 
01:47:57.550 --> 01:47:57.560 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is it gets us out of
 
01:47:57.560 --> 01:47:58.470 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is it gets us out of
that

01:47:58.470 --> 01:47:58.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:48:01.990 --> 01:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
trap in essence what we're doing is
 
01:48:04.709 --> 01:48:04.719 align:start position:0%
we're legalizing and and and essentially
 
01:48:06.830 --> 01:48:06.840 align:start position:0%
agreeing not to prosecute people for
 
01:48:09.709 --> 01:48:09.719 align:start position:0%
possessing an extremely small amount
 
01:48:12.669 --> 01:48:12.679 align:start position:0%
amount of a drug for testing purposes
 
01:48:15.270 --> 01:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
only if they're caught with a bag of
 
01:48:17.310 --> 01:48:17.320 align:start position:0%
drugs and a fentanyl test strip a
 
01:48:18.950 --> 01:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
fentanyl test strip or another kind of
 
01:48:21.669 --> 01:48:21.679 align:start position:0%
test strip isn't a get out of jail free
 
01:48:23.430 --> 01:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
card for anybody you're still going to
 
01:48:25.550 --> 01:48:25.560 align:start position:0%
be prosecuted under the law and this
 
01:48:27.310 --> 01:48:27.320 align:start position:0%
Bill calls for
 
01:48:30.669 --> 01:48:30.679 align:start position:0%
that what one of the reasons why we need
 
01:48:32.589 --> 01:48:32.599 align:start position:0%
bills like this is we are not in a
 
01:48:36.350 --> 01:48:36.360 align:start position:0%
static situation when it comes to our
 
01:48:37.950 --> 01:48:37.960 align:start position:0%
epidemic of drug
 
01:48:40.709 --> 01:48:40.719 align:start position:0%
overdoses uh there's a new fentanyl like
 
01:48:42.709 --> 01:48:42.719 align:start position:0%
compound that's actually starting to hit
 
01:48:45.189 --> 01:48:45.199 align:start position:0%
the streets in other states called
 
01:48:49.709 --> 01:48:49.719 align:start position:0%
nine nine is two to 50 times more
 
01:48:49.719 --> 01:48:50.910 align:start position:0%
nine nine is two to 50 times more
powerful

01:48:50.910 --> 01:48:50.920 align:start position:0%
powerful
 
01:48:50.920 --> 01:48:51.910 align:start position:0%
powerful
than

01:48:51.910 --> 01:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
than
 
01:48:55.629 --> 01:48:55.639 align:start position:0%
Fentanyl and unfortunately a fentanyl
 
01:48:59.830 --> 01:48:59.840 align:start position:0%
test strip will not detect
 
01:49:03.430 --> 01:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
nine to my knowledge there are no nine
 
01:49:06.149 --> 01:49:06.159 align:start position:0%
test drips available at this
 
01:49:09.310 --> 01:49:09.320 align:start position:0%
point I I don't know if there's any kind
 
01:49:11.790 --> 01:49:11.800 align:start position:0%
of a test kit that's in development uh
 
01:49:13.750 --> 01:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
that's going to hit the street soon but
 
01:49:16.629 --> 01:49:16.639 align:start position:0%
what I do know is that nine and other
 
01:49:19.189 --> 01:49:19.199 align:start position:0%
compounds like it are actually things
 
01:49:21.510 --> 01:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
that will show up in Laboratory Testing
 
01:49:23.149 --> 01:49:23.159 align:start position:0%
so one of the other things that this
 
01:49:26.870 --> 01:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
bill does as part of
 
01:49:29.990 --> 01:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
this oh I'm sorry one of the other
 
01:49:32.310 --> 01:49:32.320 align:start position:0%
things that this bill does is is it
 
01:49:33.950 --> 01:49:33.960 align:start position:0%
actually makes it legal for
 
01:49:35.629 --> 01:49:35.639 align:start position:0%
organizations that provide harm
 
01:49:37.109 --> 01:49:37.119 align:start position:0%
reduction services and that are
 
01:49:39.229 --> 01:49:39.239 align:start position:0%
authorized by the state uh like harm
 
01:49:43.629 --> 01:49:43.639 align:start position:0%
reduction agencies uh to actually test
 
01:49:46.390 --> 01:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
drugs and uh the lab equipment that they
 
01:49:49.350 --> 01:49:49.360 align:start position:0%
use uh also would be exempt under the
 
01:49:49.360 --> 01:49:51.189 align:start position:0%
use uh also would be exempt under the
law

01:49:51.189 --> 01:49:51.199 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:49:52.589 --> 01:49:52.599 align:start position:0%
one thing I think we need to realize
 
01:49:54.470 --> 01:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about quantities like
 
01:49:57.070 --> 01:49:57.080 align:start position:0%
10 milligrams uh and that's the nominal
 
01:49:59.430 --> 01:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
amount that's part of the bill is that
 
01:50:01.510 --> 01:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
this is an extremely small amount and
 
01:50:02.990 --> 01:50:03.000 align:start position:0%
we're talking about people who are
 
01:50:06.229 --> 01:50:06.239 align:start position:0%
addicted to drugs so to give you an idea
 
01:50:08.310 --> 01:50:08.320 align:start position:0%
what 10 milligrams of powder looks like
 
01:50:10.390 --> 01:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
that's enough powder to cover the beard
 
01:50:12.189 --> 01:50:12.199 align:start position:0%
of Abraham Lincoln on a
 
01:50:15.790 --> 01:50:15.800 align:start position:0%
penny um so I I don't dispute the fact
 
01:50:17.310 --> 01:50:17.320 align:start position:0%
that there are some drugs that are out
 
01:50:19.189 --> 01:50:19.199 align:start position:0%
there that if you have that quantity of
 
01:50:22.109 --> 01:50:22.119 align:start position:0%
of drug it it can kill you if you ingest
 
01:50:24.870 --> 01:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
it the issue that we have is that to
 
01:50:27.910 --> 01:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
make drug checking practical people need
 
01:50:30.030 --> 01:50:30.040 align:start position:0%
to be able to test a certain amount of
 
01:50:32.950 --> 01:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
the drug try and hold that amount of
 
01:50:34.510 --> 01:50:34.520 align:start position:0%
powder or try to put that amount of
 
01:50:37.669 --> 01:50:37.679 align:start position:0%
powder in a bag this is this is one of
 
01:50:39.109 --> 01:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
the one of the things that we're up
 
01:50:41.550 --> 01:50:41.560 align:start position:0%
against right now if we want to make an
 
01:50:44.189 --> 01:50:44.199 align:start position:0%
impact and we want to save lives these
 
01:50:45.990 --> 01:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
are the sort of decisions that we
 
01:50:48.470 --> 01:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
actually have to be prepared to make we
 
01:50:51.149 --> 01:50:51.159 align:start position:0%
have to decide which which is more
 
01:50:53.709 --> 01:50:53.719 align:start position:0%
important we're we're in a position if
 
01:50:56.270 --> 01:50:56.280 align:start position:0%
if somebody is actually caught with more
 
01:50:58.030 --> 01:50:58.040 align:start position:0%
drugs and is caught with drugs with
 
01:50:59.350 --> 01:50:59.360 align:start position:0%
possession to sell there's nothing in
 
01:51:02.030 --> 01:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
this bill that is actually going to keep
 
01:51:03.990 --> 01:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
that person from being
 
01:51:07.030 --> 01:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
prosecuted nothing at all all that we're
 
01:51:09.669 --> 01:51:09.679 align:start position:0%
saying is that if you and this this
 
01:51:11.589 --> 01:51:11.599 align:start position:0%
could be somebody's son Somebody's
 
01:51:13.390 --> 01:51:13.400 align:start position:0%
Daughter somebody's wife somebody's
 
01:51:16.189 --> 01:51:16.199 align:start position:0%
husband but if if you're in a position
 
01:51:18.310 --> 01:51:18.320 align:start position:0%
where you have a small amount of drug
 
01:51:20.229 --> 01:51:20.239 align:start position:0%
and you want to know what's in the that
 
01:51:21.830 --> 01:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
pill before you take it or what's in
 
01:51:24.189 --> 01:51:24.199 align:start position:0%
that powder before you ingest
 
01:51:27.510 --> 01:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
it you have that ability you have the
 
01:51:30.229 --> 01:51:30.239 align:start position:0%
ability to save yourself because the
 
01:51:33.550 --> 01:51:33.560 align:start position:0%
problem the the problem that we have
 
01:51:37.109 --> 01:51:37.119 align:start position:0%
with the problem that we have is we
 
01:51:39.669 --> 01:51:39.679 align:start position:0%
can't turn people around we can't get
 
01:51:42.310 --> 01:51:42.320 align:start position:0%
people into recovery after they're
 
01:51:45.109 --> 01:51:45.119 align:start position:0%
dead what this does is give people
 
01:51:47.310 --> 01:51:47.320 align:start position:0%
another chance and gives them an
 
01:51:50.350 --> 01:51:50.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity to make a decision not to
 
01:51:52.189 --> 01:51:52.199 align:start position:0%
take a drug and maybe to take other
 
01:51:54.030 --> 01:51:54.040 align:start position:0%
decisions that could really change the
 
01:51:57.510 --> 01:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
course of their lives this is an
 
01:52:01.550 --> 01:52:01.560 align:start position:0%
extremely an extremely important bill uh

02:04:22.629 --> 02:04:22.639 align:start position:0%
important to make sure Public Schools

constituents property taxes
 
02:04:52.189 --> 02:04:52.199 align:start position:0%
this bill is amended would change the
 
02:04:54.390 --> 02:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
program and allow the New Hampshire
 
02:04:56.709 --> 02:04:56.719 align:start position:0%
Department of Education to award
 
02:04:59.350 --> 02:04:59.360 align:start position:0%
building Aid grants to privately owned

and managed charter
 
02:05:04.990 --> 02:05:05.000 align:start position:0%
schools and it's on top of existing law
 
02:05:07.430 --> 02:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
that already provides charter schools
 
02:05:10.109 --> 02:05:10.119 align:start position:0%
with $50,000 a year to cover facility
 
02:05:13.870 --> 02:05:13.880 align:start position:0%
costs and $46 million in federal grants
 
02:05:15.470 --> 02:05:15.480 align:start position:0%
that can be used for construction and
 
02:05:18.109 --> 02:05:18.119 align:start position:0%
renovation projects for new and existing
 
02:05:19.629 --> 02:05:19.639 align:start position:0%
Charter School
 
02:05:23.149 --> 02:05:23.159 align:start position:0%
R but why is the bill is amended
 
02:05:25.350 --> 02:05:25.360 align:start position:0%
irresponsible because it's open to fraud
 
02:05:28.350 --> 02:05:28.360 align:start position:0%
and misuse and leaves State taxpayers
 
02:05:30.510 --> 02:05:30.520 align:start position:0%
holding the bag when a charter school
 
02:05:31.870 --> 02:05:31.880 align:start position:0%
goes out of
 
02:05:35.189 --> 02:05:35.199 align:start position:0%
business over the decades 10% of charter
 
02:05:37.350 --> 02:05:37.360 align:start position:0%
schools in New Hampshire have ceased
 
02:05:39.709 --> 02:05:39.719 align:start position:0%
operations for reasons including low
 
02:05:43.390 --> 02:05:43.400 align:start position:0%
enrollment insolvency and
 
02:05:46.030 --> 02:05:46.040 align:start position:0%
fraud proponents will say the amendment
 
02:05:49.270 --> 02:05:49.280 align:start position:0%
per Checks taxpayers In in the event a
 
02:05:51.750 --> 02:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
charter goes out of business but
 
02:05:54.870 --> 02:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
actually it does nothing about that if a
 
02:05:57.350 --> 02:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
public school were to cease operation or
 
02:05:59.109 --> 02:05:59.119 align:start position:0%
discontinue the use of a building that
 
02:06:01.310 --> 02:06:01.320 align:start position:0%
benefited from the building aid program
 
02:06:04.350 --> 02:06:04.360 align:start position:0%
the state has to be paid back but no
 
02:06:06.910 --> 02:06:06.920 align:start position:0%
such provision would apply to charter
 
02:06:08.669 --> 02:06:08.679 align:start position:0%
schools in this
 
02:06:10.990 --> 02:06:11.000 align:start position:0%
bill currently the Departments of

loopholes for financial fraud and misuse
 
02:06:24.109 --> 02:06:24.119 align:start position:0%
with this bill I'm asking you to vote no
 
02:06:25.750 --> 02:06:25.760 align:start position:0%

House Bill 354 repeals a contradicting

infrastructure Fund in other words the
 
02:07:13.069 --> 02:07:13.079 align:start position:0%
passage of this bill will not result in

Monumental change to statute but it will
 
02:07:20.510 --> 02:07:20.520 align:start position:0%

02:07:59.149 --> 02:07:59.159 align:start position:0%
may otherwise drop out of school as
 
02:08:02.149 --> 02:08:02.159 align:start position:0%
these graduates seek high high education
 
02:08:05.990 --> 02:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
a provision of House Bill 354 as amended
 
02:08:10.030 --> 02:08:10.040 align:start position:0%
ensures successful transcript transfer
 
02:08:13.790 --> 02:08:13.800 align:start position:0%
so students can flourish in college and
 
02:08:17.229 --> 02:08:17.239 align:start position:0%
Beyond furthermore the primary aim of
 
02:08:20.310 --> 02:08:20.320 align:start position:0%
house bill free5 for is to enable
 
02:08:22.990 --> 02:08:23.000 align:start position:0%
chartered public schools to apply for
 
02:08:25.950 --> 02:08:25.960 align:start position:0%
State Building Aid which traditional
 
02:08:30.430 --> 02:08:30.440 align:start position:0%
public schools have always been able to
 
02:08:33.430 --> 02:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
do chartered Public Schools would need
 
02:08:36.750 --> 02:08:36.760 align:start position:0%
to complete the same application and
 
02:08:39.709 --> 02:08:39.719 align:start position:0%
demonstrate the same need as traditional
 
02:08:43.229 --> 02:08:43.239 align:start position:0%
public schools yet unlike traditional
 
02:08:46.830 --> 02:08:46.840 align:start position:0%
schools who receive funds upfront
 
02:08:49.189 --> 02:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools would grab gradually
 
02:08:52.310 --> 02:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
receive Aid which adds the burden of
 
02:08:56.189 --> 02:08:56.199 align:start position:0%
raising funds prior to construction but
 
02:08:58.750 --> 02:08:58.760 align:start position:0%
in addition Charter Schools would only
 
02:09:02.990 --> 02:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
be eligible to receive 30% of
 
02:09:05.270 --> 02:09:05.280 align:start position:0%
construction cost whereas some
 
02:09:08.750 --> 02:09:08.760 align:start position:0%
traditional schools receive up to
 
02:09:12.709 --> 02:09:12.719 align:start position:0%
60% consequently House Bill free 54
 
02:09:16.790 --> 02:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
enables charter schools to apply to
 
02:09:20.109 --> 02:09:20.119 align:start position:0%
maybe be granted half of the funds that
 
02:09:23.109 --> 02:09:23.119 align:start position:0%
traditional schools already receive and
 
02:09:25.510 --> 02:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
have always
 
02:09:28.229 --> 02:09:28.239 align:start position:0%
received finally Charter School
 
02:09:30.709 --> 02:09:30.719 align:start position:0%
enrollment has increased
 
02:09:34.470 --> 02:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
35% since prior to the pandemic several
 
02:09:37.350 --> 02:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
of the existing 32 charter schools have
 
02:09:40.669 --> 02:09:40.679 align:start position:0%
weight lists and three new charter
 
02:09:43.709 --> 02:09:43.719 align:start position:0%
schools have been approved to open this
 
02:09:47.470 --> 02:09:47.480 align:start position:0%
year with such extraordinary high demand
 
02:09:50.510 --> 02:09:50.520 align:start position:0%

02:11:52.270 --> 02:11:52.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
02:11:55.510 --> 02:11:55.520 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that there is
 
02:11:58.669 --> 02:11:58.679 align:start position:0%
currently a severe limit to the
 
02:12:01.030 --> 02:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
availability of State funds for building
 
02:12:04.470 --> 02:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
Aid and that there's a large backlog of
 
02:12:06.270 --> 02:12:06.280 align:start position:0%
building age
 
02:12:08.750 --> 02:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
requests and if I know that charter
 
02:12:11.270 --> 02:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
schools are privately owned and
 
02:12:13.950 --> 02:12:13.960 align:start position:0%
independently managed and that there are
 
02:12:16.589 --> 02:12:16.599 align:start position:0%
serious questions as to whether or not
 
02:12:19.910 --> 02:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
public tax dollars should be allowed
 
02:12:22.189 --> 02:12:22.199 align:start position:0%
allocated for construction of private
 
02:12:24.910 --> 02:12:24.920 align:start position:0%
schools and further that there is
 
02:12:28.229 --> 02:12:28.239 align:start position:0%
current issues around the disposition of
 
02:12:31.109 --> 02:12:31.119 align:start position:0%
those assets should a charter school
 
02:12:32.270 --> 02:12:32.280 align:start position:0%
cease to
 
02:12:35.149 --> 02:12:35.159 align:start position:0%
exist and finally if I believe that this
 
02:12:38.589 --> 02:12:38.599 align:start position:0%
bill is better placed into interim study
 
02:12:42.149 --> 02:12:42.159 align:start position:0%
status as a full review of building Aid
 
02:12:44.629 --> 02:12:44.639 align:start position:0%
and the process of building Aid is
 
02:12:46.830 --> 02:12:46.840 align:start position:0%
currently being conducted by the
 
02:12:48.669 --> 02:12:48.679 align:start position:0%
Department of Education
 
02:12:51.229 --> 02:12:51.239 align:start position:0%
for those factors Mr Speaker I urge the
 
02:12:53.390 --> 02:12:53.400 align:start position:0%
assembly to vote no and press the red
 
02:12:55.310 --> 02:12:55.320 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you very much Mr
 
02:13:07.189 --> 02:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know this bill is not about
 
02:13:09.510 --> 02:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
leased charter schools which are
 
02:13:11.629 --> 02:13:11.639 align:start position:0%
eligible to receive up to
 
02:13:15.189 --> 02:13:15.199 align:start position:0%
$50,000 per year but it's about charter
 
02:13:17.310 --> 02:13:17.320 align:start position:0%
schools that are not eligible for that
 
02:13:20.430 --> 02:13:20.440 align:start position:0%
money and not eligible for the charter
 
02:13:22.390 --> 02:13:22.400 align:start position:0%
school building Aid that we're proposing
 
02:13:24.990 --> 02:13:25.000 align:start position:0%
right here if I know as amended this
 
02:13:28.510 --> 02:13:28.520 align:start position:0%
bill requires any Charter Charter School
 
02:13:30.830 --> 02:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
applying for school building Aid to be
 
02:13:34.069 --> 02:13:34.079 align:start position:0%

enrollment and Charters continue to grow
 
02:14:23.750 --> 02:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
steadily and the limitations of their
 
02:14:27.470 --> 02:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
original startup space makes expansion
 
02:14:30.950 --> 02:14:30.960 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
02:38:05.750 --> 02:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
that this bill would impose government

done if I know that this bill would
 
02:38:18.309 --> 02:38:18.319 align:start position:0%
require Visitor Center staff to get
 
02:38:21.190 --> 02:38:21.200 align:start position:0%

account but how would they
 
02:38:29.349 --> 02:38:29.359 align:start position:0%
know and if I know that homeschool
 
02:38:32.309 --> 02:38:32.319 align:start position:0%

02:38:40.230 --> 02:38:40.240 align:start position:0%

morning colleagues if I know as a parent

children is of utmost
 
02:39:11.830 --> 02:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
importance and if I know that where a
 
02:39:14.309 --> 02:39:14.319 align:start position:0%
child is educated does not change the
 
02:39:17.269 --> 02:39:17.279 align:start position:0%
need for safety yet private schools and
 
02:39:19.670 --> 02:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
education organizations are not

thirdly we also had a grant approved for
 
02:46:54.150 --> 02:46:54.160 align:start position:0%
implementation the
 
02:46:57.469 --> 02:46:57.479 align:start position:0%
mtssb that's the multi- system of
 
02:47:00.670 --> 02:47:00.680 align:start position:0%
support for mental health behavioral
 
02:47:02.230 --> 02:47:02.240 align:start position:0%
issues in
 
02:47:06.550 --> 02:47:06.560 align:start position:0%
schools and as a prior teacher myself an
 
02:47:09.550 --> 02:47:09.560 align:start position:0%
administrator for some 30 years this is
 
02:47:13.110 --> 02:47:13.120 align:start position:0%
a program we do need and we also
 
02:47:15.349 --> 02:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
appropriated $900,000
 
02:47:20.309 --> 02:47:20.319 align:start position:0%
in hb2 and FY 23 for the purpose of
 
02:47:23.429 --> 02:47:23.439 align:start position:0%
providing grant money where mtssb can be
 
02:47:25.910 --> 02:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
used in schools it's a three- tiered
 
02:47:29.150 --> 02:47:29.160 align:start position:0%
system in which the first tier is one
 
02:47:31.590 --> 02:47:31.600 align:start position:0%
which is done by the class from teacher
 
02:47:33.429 --> 02:47:33.439 align:start position:0%
it deals with you know when you went to
 
02:47:35.590 --> 02:47:35.600 align:start position:0%
school there's a report card one side is
 
02:47:37.790 --> 02:47:37.800 align:start position:0%
behavioral you take that side home and
 
02:47:39.150 --> 02:47:39.160 align:start position:0%
show it your father your mother and they
 
02:47:40.870 --> 02:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
all ripped off at you because your
 
02:47:42.870 --> 02:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
behavior wasn't paring your good
 
02:47:45.030 --> 02:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
academic side of the calendar or the of
 
02:47:48.389 --> 02:47:48.399 align:start position:0%
the of the report that's the teacher job
 
02:47:51.269 --> 02:47:51.279 align:start position:0%
is to recognize students which are being
 
02:47:53.150 --> 02:47:53.160 align:start position:0%
hammered by mental health issues where
 
02:47:54.389 --> 02:47:54.399 align:start position:0%
it's being brought in through our
 
02:47:57.269 --> 02:47:57.279 align:start position:0%
society through social media or lack of
 
02:47:59.910 --> 02:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
parenting at home or just a number of
 
02:48:01.750 --> 02:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
other issues including
 
02:48:04.950 --> 02:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
bullying the second tier in this is a
 
02:48:07.950 --> 02:48:07.960 align:start position:0%
tier which we recognize and through our
 
02:48:07.960 --> 02:48:08.910 align:start position:0%
tier which we recognize and through our
school

02:48:08.910 --> 02:48:08.920 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:48:11.590 --> 02:48:11.600 align:start position:0%
psychologist that there is a risk here
 
02:48:13.950 --> 02:48:13.960 align:start position:0%
for those students and we deal with that
 
02:48:16.510 --> 02:48:16.520 align:start position:0%
the third tier here deals with reporting
 
02:48:19.429 --> 02:48:19.439 align:start position:0%
to psychiatrists and MDS outside the
 
02:48:21.870 --> 02:48:21.880 align:start position:0%
school system the school system is not
 
02:48:23.870 --> 02:48:23.880 align:start position:0%
getting in the business at teaching what
 
02:48:25.349 --> 02:48:25.359 align:start position:0%
you should think or what you shouldn't
 
02:48:28.830 --> 02:48:28.840 align:start position:0%
think in regard to this topic so I want
 
02:48:31.870 --> 02:48:31.880 align:start position:0%
to be very careful that we recognize
 
02:48:34.269 --> 02:48:34.279 align:start position:0%
that mental health is a serious issue in
 
02:48:36.790 --> 02:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
our schools in our society and it's
 
02:48:39.630 --> 02:48:39.640 align:start position:0%
brought on for many different
 
02:48:43.030 --> 02:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
reasons but put yourself in a
 
02:48:45.830 --> 02:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
classroom as a teacher
 
02:48:47.030 --> 02:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
and you have a student that's just
 
02:48:50.269 --> 02:48:50.279 align:start position:0%
thrown a desk across the room which
 
02:48:52.429 --> 02:48:52.439 align:start position:0%
happens or puts their hand through the
 
02:48:54.349 --> 02:48:54.359 align:start position:0%
sheet rock in the wall of the the
 
02:48:57.429 --> 02:48:57.439 align:start position:0%
building that happens too there has to
 
02:48:59.429 --> 02:48:59.439 align:start position:0%
be a way of dealing with this and it's
 
02:49:01.670 --> 02:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
happening more frequently especially
 
02:49:03.710 --> 02:49:03.720 align:start position:0%
since we've gone through
 
02:49:07.630 --> 02:49:07.640 align:start position:0%
covid but what we can't let happen we
 
02:49:11.110 --> 02:49:11.120 align:start position:0%
cannot let this bill go into effect it
 
02:49:14.830 --> 02:49:14.840 align:start position:0%
will put another subject that's over
 
02:49:17.190 --> 02:49:17.200 align:start position:0%
already a component within Health in the
 
02:49:17.200 --> 02:49:19.630 align:start position:0%
already a component within Health in the
adequacy

02:49:19.630 --> 02:49:19.640 align:start position:0%
adequacy
 
02:49:22.190 --> 02:49:22.200 align:start position:0%
formula and that's going to result in
 
02:49:24.670 --> 02:49:24.680 align:start position:0%
many many other issues and
 
02:49:27.510 --> 02:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
consequences so the recommendation
 
02:49:30.389 --> 02:49:30.399 align:start position:0%
that's coming from the from us right
 
02:49:33.590 --> 02:49:33.600 align:start position:0%
here against this bill is that it should
 
02:49:36.910 --> 02:49:36.920 align:start position:0%
not go forward we already have mental
 
02:49:40.429 --> 02:49:40.439 align:start position:0%
health addressed in
 
02:49:44.349 --> 02:49:44.359 align:start position:0%
Statute in state board rules and through
 
02:49:46.110 --> 02:49:46.120 align:start position:0%
program programs that are being used in
 
02:49:48.349 --> 02:49:48.359 align:start position:0%
our schools and through funding as a
 
02:49:52.110 --> 02:49:52.120 align:start position:0%
result of hb2 thank
 
02:49:59.389 --> 02:49:59.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:01.710 --> 02:50:01.720 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr Speaker and good

morning again
 
02:50:06.469 --> 02:50:06.479 align:start position:0%
colleagues I stand before you to urge
 
02:50:12.990 --> 02:50:13.000 align:start position:0%
you to support OTP on SB 151 to require
 
02:50:16.309 --> 02:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
mental health education in in schools
 
02:50:18.429 --> 02:50:18.439 align:start position:0%
with respect to my colleague who just
 
02:50:21.870 --> 02:50:21.880 align:start position:0%
spoke and defined the tears of
 
02:50:25.269 --> 02:50:25.279 align:start position:0%
mtssb it's a great protocol and it is
 
02:50:27.710 --> 02:50:27.720 align:start position:0%
not required it is not present in all
 
02:50:30.950 --> 02:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
schools we cannot rely on that to
 
02:50:33.469 --> 02:50:33.479 align:start position:0%
provide our students mental health
 
02:50:36.429 --> 02:50:36.439 align:start position:0%
education let me back up a minute to the
 
02:50:39.630 --> 02:50:39.640 align:start position:0%
basics mental illnesses are acute or
 
02:50:41.950 --> 02:50:41.960 align:start position:0%
chronic illnesses they affect an
 
02:50:45.030 --> 02:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
individual's emotional psychological and
 
02:50:47.950 --> 02:50:47.960 align:start position:0%
social well-being and sometimes our
 
02:50:52.229 --> 02:50:52.239 align:start position:0%
Behavior they are very common if you
 
02:50:54.830 --> 02:50:54.840 align:start position:0%
look at the national statistics at least
 
02:50:56.429 --> 02:50:56.439 align:start position:0%
a third of those of us in
 
02:51:00.110 --> 02:51:00.120 align:start position:0%
Representatives Hall today have or have
 
02:51:02.870 --> 02:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
in the past dealt with mental
 
02:51:05.750 --> 02:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
illness they're not aberant they're just
 
02:51:07.910 --> 02:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
part of some
 
02:51:10.950 --> 02:51:10.960 align:start position:0%
people's construction if you
 
02:51:15.229 --> 02:51:15.239 align:start position:0%
will these conditions include not only
 
02:51:18.630 --> 02:51:18.640 align:start position:0%
but most commonly depression anxiety
 
02:51:21.630 --> 02:51:21.640 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder schizophrenia and
 
02:51:23.670 --> 02:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
mood or personality
 
02:51:26.750 --> 02:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
disorders this bill originated and I
 
02:51:30.229 --> 02:51:30.239 align:start position:0%
think this is very important by respect
 
02:51:33.630 --> 02:51:33.640 align:start position:0%
of the governor's youth advisory Council
 
02:51:36.550 --> 02:51:36.560 align:start position:0%
the students are asking us to help them
 
02:51:39.750 --> 02:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
be more educated about mental
 
02:51:44.030 --> 02:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
health we heard poignant testimony from
 
02:51:46.550 --> 02:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
teens who did not receive mental health
 
02:51:48.349 --> 02:51:48.359 align:start position:0%
education in their
 
02:51:51.750 --> 02:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
schooling I recall one particular young
 
02:51:54.469 --> 02:51:54.479 align:start position:0%
woman last winter a high school senior
 
02:51:57.910 --> 02:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
now in college who spoke about her
 
02:52:01.150 --> 02:52:01.160 align:start position:0%
friend and she driving along and then
 
02:52:04.349 --> 02:52:04.359 align:start position:0%
her friend is in the midst of a panic
 
02:52:07.070 --> 02:52:07.080 align:start position:0%
attack and neither one of them knows
 
02:52:10.269 --> 02:52:10.279 align:start position:0%
what it is or what to do the woman who
 
02:52:12.990 --> 02:52:13.000 align:start position:0%
testified the young woman was Googling
 
02:52:15.110 --> 02:52:15.120 align:start position:0%
madly and trying to get get her friend
 
02:52:17.870 --> 02:52:17.880 align:start position:0%
to pull over and thank goodness no lives
 
02:52:21.469 --> 02:52:21.479 align:start position:0%
were lost had she had mental health
 
02:52:23.750 --> 02:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
education she would have been better
 
02:52:29.030 --> 02:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:32.389 --> 02:52:32.399 align:start position:0%

last several years
 
02:52:50.510 --> 02:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
years these are all related to mental
 
02:52:53.750 --> 02:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
health it is important to be very clear
 
02:52:57.030 --> 02:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
that this bill does not in any way
 
02:53:00.070 --> 02:53:00.080 align:start position:0%
provide diagnosis or treatment of mental

health conditions that's not the role of

Education
 
02:53:07.190 --> 02:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
professionals what it does is simply
 
02:53:09.590 --> 02:53:09.600 align:start position:0%
include education on Mental Health
 
02:53:13.070 --> 02:53:13.080 align:start position:0%
disorders in curriculum the same way
 
02:53:14.710 --> 02:53:14.720 align:start position:0%
that we inform students of
 
02:53:17.630 --> 02:53:17.640 align:start position:0%
cardiovascular disease of

02:53:25.830 --> 02:53:25.840 align:start position:0%
conditions this legislation could help
 
02:53:28.469 --> 02:53:28.479 align:start position:0%
decrease the stigma around mental health
 
02:53:31.309 --> 02:53:31.319 align:start position:0%
that affects as I noted so many of us
 
02:53:33.229 --> 02:53:33.239 align:start position:0%
from students to
 
02:53:36.110 --> 02:53:36.120 align:start position:0%

a parliamentary inquiry thank you Mr
 
02:55:02.030 --> 02:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know mental health
 
02:55:04.150 --> 02:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
standards are currently identified as a
 
02:55:06.429 --> 02:55:06.439 align:start position:0%
key component of Health and Wellness
 
02:55:10.030 --> 02:55:10.040 align:start position:0%
within the adequacy standards and if I
 
02:55:11.590 --> 02:55:11.600 align:start position:0%
also know the health education
 
02:55:13.910 --> 02:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
curriculum guidelines and accompanying
 
02:55:15.510 --> 02:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
stand standards approved by the state
 
02:55:18.030 --> 02:55:18.040 align:start position:0%
board already address mental health

curriculum for the elementary middle and
 
02:55:23.110 --> 02:55:23.120 align:start position:0%
high school grades so this bill is not

the following resolution resolved that
 
04:30:43.830 --> 04:30:43.840 align:start position:0%

Reed

04:31:16.830 --> 04:31:16.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:21.389 --> 04:31:21.399 align:start position:0%
okay we'll do it like this um so I just
 
04:31:24.030 --> 04:31:24.040 align:start position:0%
the underlying Bill does nothing it's
 
04:31:26.830 --> 04:31:26.840 align:start position:0%
just an enabling bill that enables
 
04:31:28.429 --> 04:31:28.439 align:start position:0%
private parties which are private
 
04:31:30.790 --> 04:31:30.800 align:start position:0%
organizations and municipalities by a
 
04:31:33.349 --> 04:31:33.359 align:start position:0%
vote of the people to run their own
 
04:31:35.229 --> 04:31:35.239 align:start position:0%
elections that's primaries and municipal
 
04:31:37.070 --> 04:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
election by rank Choice voting if they
 
04:31:37.080 --> 04:31:38.109 align:start position:0%
election by rank Choice voting if they
so

04:31:38.109 --> 04:31:38.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:31:40.149 --> 04:31:40.159 align:start position:0%
choose some of you who've been here for
 
04:31:41.710 --> 04:31:41.720 align:start position:0%
a while know that this is not my first
 
04:31:43.070 --> 04:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
rodeo when it comes to rank Choice
 
04:31:45.030 --> 04:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
voting so I rather than talk to the bill
 
04:31:46.590 --> 04:31:46.600 align:start position:0%
which someone else will do I wanted to
 
04:31:49.710 --> 04:31:49.720 align:start position:0%
address a few common misconceptions
 
04:31:51.870 --> 04:31:51.880 align:start position:0%
about rank Choice voting that you might
 
04:31:55.109 --> 04:31:55.119 align:start position:0%
have heard you may have even said them
 
04:31:57.429 --> 04:31:57.439 align:start position:0%
the first and and I want to say that
 
04:32:01.469 --> 04:32:01.479 align:start position:0%
because I feel like this has become very
 
04:32:04.630 --> 04:32:04.640 align:start position:0%
partisan nonsensically partisan and it
 
04:32:07.429 --> 04:32:07.439 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be those who know me know that
 
04:32:09.189 --> 04:32:09.199 align:start position:0%
while I have very very strong opinions
 
04:32:12.389 --> 04:32:12.399 align:start position:0%
about a wide range of topics know that I
 
04:32:15.389 --> 04:32:15.399 align:start position:0%
am no respector of party and that I
 
04:32:17.269 --> 04:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
believe in doing the right thing and I
 
04:32:19.109 --> 04:32:19.119 align:start position:0%
believe that the people of our state in
 
04:32:21.750 --> 04:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
this country need to be represented by
 
04:32:25.469 --> 04:32:25.479 align:start position:0%
their government so the first
 
04:32:27.950 --> 04:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
misconception is that it's somehow going
 
04:32:30.389 --> 04:32:30.399 align:start position:0%
to be confusing it would confuse voters
 
04:32:31.590 --> 04:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
it would confuse the people who
 
04:32:35.790 --> 04:32:35.800 align:start position:0%
implement the elections um if you
 
04:32:38.710 --> 04:32:38.720 align:start position:0%
understand runoff elections then you
 
04:32:40.429 --> 04:32:40.439 align:start position:0%
understand ranked Choice voting in fact
 
04:32:42.510 --> 04:32:42.520 align:start position:0%
the other name for ranked Choice voting
 
04:32:45.389 --> 04:32:45.399 align:start position:0%
is instant runoff elections and while
 
04:32:48.189 --> 04:32:48.199 align:start position:0%
runoff elections which are meant to get
 
04:32:50.870 --> 04:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
the majority winner in the cases that
 
04:32:52.550 --> 04:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
you know someone has split the vote a
 
04:32:54.750 --> 04:32:54.760 align:start position:0%
third party or an independent has split
 
04:32:58.389 --> 04:32:58.399 align:start position:0%
the vote um runoff elections find the
 
04:33:01.109 --> 04:33:01.119 align:start position:0%
majority the person with the most actual
 
04:33:04.029 --> 04:33:04.039 align:start position:0%
support but they take time they take a
 
04:33:05.869 --> 04:33:05.879 align:start position:0%
lot of money
 
04:33:08.750 --> 04:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
and they they suffer from reduced voter
 
04:33:11.230 --> 04:33:11.240 align:start position:0%
turnout instant runoff voting rank
 
04:33:13.070 --> 04:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
Choice voting does all of it in one
 
04:33:15.230 --> 04:33:15.240 align:start position:0%
ballot and in fact in southern states
 
04:33:18.189 --> 04:33:18.199 align:start position:0%
that have runoff elections conservative
 
04:33:21.390 --> 04:33:21.400 align:start position:0%
States their overseas military ballots
 
04:33:23.830 --> 04:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
are ranked Choice voting ballots because
 
04:33:25.949 --> 04:33:25.959 align:start position:0%
their overseas military personnel don't
 
04:33:28.629 --> 04:33:28.639 align:start position:0%
have time to get a new runoff election
 
04:33:32.070 --> 04:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
ballot sent to them exit polls in states
 
04:33:34.510 --> 04:33:34.520 align:start position:0%
that have implemented rank Choice voting
 
04:33:36.709 --> 04:33:36.719 align:start position:0%
whether on the municipal level or on the
 
04:33:39.269 --> 04:33:39.279 align:start position:0%
state level States like New Mexico New
 
04:33:42.789 --> 04:33:42.799 align:start position:0%
York Alaska Maine Minnesota Utah all
 
04:33:45.390 --> 04:33:45.400 align:start position:0%
those exit poll show that the experience
 
04:33:48.470 --> 04:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
of the voters 95% have a good or
 
04:33:51.150 --> 04:33:51.160 align:start position:0%
excellent experience with rank Choice
 
04:33:53.269 --> 04:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
voting they understand what to do they
 
04:33:55.429 --> 04:33:55.439 align:start position:0%
understand how to cast their ballot it's
 
04:33:56.949 --> 04:33:56.959 align:start position:0%
not difficult if you can rank your
 
04:33:59.750 --> 04:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
favorite flavors of ice cream you can
 
04:34:01.590 --> 04:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
rank your favorite
 
04:34:03.830 --> 04:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
candidates further when it's been
 
04:34:06.470 --> 04:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
implemented in places like
 
04:34:08.390 --> 04:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
election workers and the Secretary of
 
04:34:10.830 --> 04:34:10.840 align:start position:0%
State who had already been opposed to
 
04:34:12.830 --> 04:34:12.840 align:start position:0%
the move to rank Choice voting once it
 
04:34:15.510 --> 04:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
was implemented across the board had
 
04:34:18.109 --> 04:34:18.119 align:start position:0%
positive results and no
 
04:34:20.551 --> 04:34:20.561 align:start position:0%
problems another thing is this idea is
 
04:34:22.349 --> 04:34:22.359 align:start position:0%
that rank Choice voting is somehow new
 
04:34:25.230 --> 04:34:25.240 align:start position:0%
or technical um it's it's been in
 
04:34:27.709 --> 04:34:27.719 align:start position:0%
existence for over a hundred years uh
 
04:34:29.990 --> 04:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
some of the most conservative U modern
 
04:34:32.510 --> 04:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
Western democracies in the world like
 
04:34:34.709 --> 04:34:34.719 align:start position:0%
Australia and Ireland have been using it
 
04:34:36.269 --> 04:34:36.279 align:start position:0%
for decades in the case of Australia
 
04:34:37.590 --> 04:34:37.600 align:start position:0%
over a 100
 
04:34:40.109 --> 04:34:40.119 align:start position:0%
years the Virginia GOP uses it
 
04:34:42.349 --> 04:34:42.359 align:start position:0%
internally to determine their candidates
 
04:34:44.709 --> 04:34:44.719 align:start position:0%
the Indiana goop uses it internally the
 
04:34:48.189 --> 04:34:48.199 align:start position:0%
Utah GOP has used it for 30 years it's
 
04:34:49.949 --> 04:34:49.959 align:start position:0%
been in use for over 100 years on the
 
04:34:52.429 --> 04:34:52.439 align:start position:0%
municipal level in this country over 27
 
04:34:54.670 --> 04:34:54.680 align:start position:0%
states have used it on the municipal
 
04:34:56.910 --> 04:34:56.920 align:start position:0%
level and hundreds and hundreds of
 
04:34:59.510 --> 04:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
universities and corporations have used
 
04:35:01.189 --> 04:35:01.199 align:start position:0%
rank Choice voting including the Academy
 
04:35:04.470 --> 04:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
Awards for decades the Robert rules
 
04:35:07.150 --> 04:35:07.160 align:start position:0%
Roberts rules of order recommends a
 
04:35:09.310 --> 04:35:09.320 align:start position:0%
method of voting that requires repeat
 
04:35:11.910 --> 04:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
balloting which is what we do here when
 
04:35:13.869 --> 04:35:13.879 align:start position:0%
we elect speaker if we have more than
 
04:35:16.709 --> 04:35:16.719 align:start position:0%
two candidates we have if if you don't
 
04:35:19.269 --> 04:35:19.279 align:start position:0%
have a majority winner somebody usually
 
04:35:21.429 --> 04:35:21.439 align:start position:0%
drops and then everybody repeats the
 
04:35:23.830 --> 04:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
ballot you can do that on one ballot by
 
04:35:26.150 --> 04:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
simply saying who you would go for next
 
04:35:28.230 --> 04:35:28.240 align:start position:0%
if your candidate is
 
04:35:30.709 --> 04:35:30.719 align:start position:0%
dropped so it's not new and it's not
 
04:35:32.869 --> 04:35:32.879 align:start position:0%
Technical and it's existed long before
 
04:35:35.869 --> 04:35:35.879 align:start position:0%
our modern voting machines
 
04:35:37.551 --> 04:35:37.561 align:start position:0%
the idea that is expensive Maine
 
04:35:39.109 --> 04:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
implemented it for under
 
04:35:42.150 --> 04:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
$100,000 or that it takes time Maine got
 
04:35:44.510 --> 04:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
their results within 27 minutes of the
 
04:35:47.789 --> 04:35:47.799 align:start position:0%
centralization of data now main law
 
04:35:50.670 --> 04:35:50.680 align:start position:0%
allows towns one week to report their
 
04:35:54.109 --> 04:35:54.119 align:start position:0%
results but we require our cers to CER
 
04:35:56.789 --> 04:35:56.799 align:start position:0%
taper results to the secretary secretary
 
04:35:59.349 --> 04:35:59.359 align:start position:0%
of state that night so we would have
 
04:36:04.109 --> 04:36:04.119 align:start position:0%
results within 27 minutes that
 
04:36:04.119 --> 04:36:05.750 align:start position:0%
results within 27 minutes that
night

04:36:05.750 --> 04:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
night
 
04:36:07.789 --> 04:36:07.799 align:start position:0%
the number one argument I've heard
 
04:36:09.670 --> 04:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
though recently and I've heard it from
 
04:36:13.230 --> 04:36:13.240 align:start position:0%
both parties is that in such and such an
 
04:36:14.990 --> 04:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
election where they used rank Choice
 
04:36:17.990 --> 04:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
voting my guy didn't
 
04:36:21.670 --> 04:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
win what a weird argument first of all
 
04:36:24.429 --> 04:36:24.439 align:start position:0%
in our current system can we not all
 
04:36:26.551 --> 04:36:26.561 align:start position:0%
point to elections under our current
 
04:36:28.709 --> 04:36:28.719 align:start position:0%
system where our person didn't
 
04:36:31.070 --> 04:36:31.080 align:start position:0%
win the thing is is we shouldn't be
 
04:36:33.109 --> 04:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
choosing systems based on whether or not
 
04:36:35.629 --> 04:36:35.639 align:start position:0%
the person we like one we should choose
 
04:36:37.629 --> 04:36:37.639 align:start position:0%
systems whether or not the majority of
 
04:36:40.109 --> 04:36:40.119 align:start position:0%
the people like the winner we should
 
04:36:42.150 --> 04:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
choose systems that actually represent
 
04:36:44.990 --> 04:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
the people so if you like someone but
 
04:36:47.349 --> 04:36:47.359 align:start position:0%
most people didn't then it's okay to
 
04:36:50.150 --> 04:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
lose that's how it's supposed to
 
04:36:52.629 --> 04:36:52.639 align:start position:0%
work so in closing this bill actually
 
04:36:55.269 --> 04:36:55.279 align:start position:0%
does nothing it just we just today heard
 
04:36:58.310 --> 04:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
arguments about local control it gives
 
04:37:01.150 --> 04:37:01.160 align:start position:0%
local control if municipalities by a
 
04:37:03.029 --> 04:37:03.039 align:start position:0%
vote of the people want to run their
 
04:37:05.949 --> 04:37:05.959 align:start position:0%
elections in rank Choice voting manner
 
04:37:07.990 --> 04:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
may have been beneficial to Manchester
 
04:37:10.551 --> 04:37:10.561 align:start position:0%
this last time around for mayor um for
 
04:37:12.230 --> 04:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
example then who are we to tell them
 
04:37:14.269 --> 04:37:14.279 align:start position:0%
they can't do that if private
 
04:37:16.269 --> 04:37:16.279 align:start position:0%
organizations like parties want to run
 
04:37:18.070 --> 04:37:18.080 align:start position:0%
their elections by rank Choice voting if
 
04:37:20.070 --> 04:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
they think it would be beneficial then
 
04:37:22.189 --> 04:37:22.199 align:start position:0%
who are we to do that we just did a bill
 
04:37:25.230 --> 04:37:25.240 align:start position:0%
earlier today we resoundingly defeated a
 
04:37:27.470 --> 04:37:27.480 align:start position:0%
bill that would have told Banks how to
 
04:37:30.709 --> 04:37:30.719 align:start position:0%
run their businesses so it's enabling
 
04:37:33.990 --> 04:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
only it's not new or scary it's good for
 
04:37:36.910 --> 04:37:36.920 align:start position:0%
the people and even if you vote against
 
04:37:39.070 --> 04:37:39.080 align:start position:0%
this I welcome you to come to me and
 
04:37:45.390 --> 04:37:45.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:53.949 --> 04:37:53.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:56.869 --> 04:37:56.879 align:start position:0%
Mirad thank you Mr speaker thank you
 
04:37:56.879 --> 04:37:58.029 align:start position:0%
Mirad thank you Mr speaker thank you
fellow

04:37:58.029 --> 04:37:58.039 align:start position:0%
fellow
 
04:38:00.029 --> 04:38:00.039 align:start position:0%
Representatives want to just emphasize a
 
04:38:01.869 --> 04:38:01.879 align:start position:0%
couple things about this bill it's an
 
04:38:04.269 --> 04:38:04.279 align:start position:0%
enabling bill as you know doesn't Force
 
04:38:07.269 --> 04:38:07.279 align:start position:0%
rank choices voting on any entity it
 
04:38:09.269 --> 04:38:09.279 align:start position:0%
allows municipalities to use it if they
 
04:38:11.510 --> 04:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
choose to that choice would have to be
 
04:38:15.029 --> 04:38:15.039 align:start position:0%
governed by referendum or other legal
 
04:38:17.869 --> 04:38:17.879 align:start position:0%
processes that embody the consent of the
 
04:38:20.789 --> 04:38:20.799 align:start position:0%
government it allows parties to use
 
04:38:24.269 --> 04:38:24.279 align:start position:0%
RVC excuse me RC if they choose to
 
04:38:26.429 --> 04:38:26.439 align:start position:0%
wouldn't force it on any party just
 
04:38:30.510 --> 04:38:30.520 align:start position:0%
allows it it would allow party to try it
 
04:38:32.590 --> 04:38:32.600 align:start position:0%
out such as the Republican Party in the
 
04:38:34.990 --> 04:38:35.000 align:start position:0%
state of Virginia has or the Democrat
 
04:38:36.910 --> 04:38:36.920 align:start position:0%
ratic party in the state of Kansas many
 
04:38:36.920 --> 04:38:38.310 align:start position:0%
ratic party in the state of Kansas many
other

04:38:38.310 --> 04:38:38.320 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:38:41.029 --> 04:38:41.039 align:start position:0%
parties would allow towns to try it out
 
04:38:43.470 --> 04:38:43.480 align:start position:0%
towns that might want to be spared the
 
04:38:45.070 --> 04:38:45.080 align:start position:0%
expense and inconvenience of having
 
04:38:47.029 --> 04:38:47.039 align:start position:0%
runoff elections in over the course of
 
04:38:47.039 --> 04:38:51.390 align:start position:0%
runoff elections in over the course of
multiple

04:38:51.390 --> 04:38:51.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:54.590 --> 04:38:54.600 align:start position:0%
days I think that towns and parties
 
04:38:57.510 --> 04:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
might opt for it might try it because
 
04:39:00.750 --> 04:39:00.760 align:start position:0%
it's a system that allows us to really
 
04:39:02.949 --> 04:39:02.959 align:start position:0%
figure out what candidate has majority
 
04:39:05.949 --> 04:39:05.959 align:start position:0%
support in multi-member
 
04:39:10.029 --> 04:39:10.039 align:start position:0%
basis and it encourages citizens to vote
 
04:39:11.949 --> 04:39:11.959 align:start position:0%
their conscience to vote for the First
 
04:39:14.830 --> 04:39:14.840 align:start position:0%
Choice candidate they really believe
 
04:39:18.510 --> 04:39:18.520 align:start position:0%
in even if they're pretty certain that
 
04:39:21.830 --> 04:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
that candidate won't win a majority they
 
04:39:23.910 --> 04:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
know they won't be wasting their ballot
 
04:39:25.949 --> 04:39:25.959 align:start position:0%
because their second choice could be
 
04:39:27.709 --> 04:39:27.719 align:start position:0%
registered in the event that their first
 
04:39:30.269 --> 04:39:30.279 align:start position:0%
choice candidate is eliminated so it
 
04:39:32.310 --> 04:39:32.320 align:start position:0%
encourages citizens to Really voice
 
04:39:34.910 --> 04:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
their first choice support and
 
04:39:37.430 --> 04:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
communicate to parties and leaders what
 
04:39:40.030 --> 04:39:40.040 align:start position:0%
they really think for that reason I
 
04:39:43.590 --> 04:39:43.600 align:start position:0%
think that this bill makes sense and I
 
04:39:45.430 --> 04:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
would encourage all my fellow
 
04:39:48.430 --> 04:39:48.440 align:start position:0%
representatives to support
 
04:39:58.150 --> 04:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:00.830 --> 04:40:00.840 align:start position:0%
quy thank you Mr
 
04:40:03.910 --> 04:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
Speaker uh I rise in support of the
 
04:40:08.190 --> 04:40:08.200 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate motion on HB
 
04:40:12.990 --> 04:40:13.000 align:start position:0%
345 uh as uh recommended in the majority
 
04:40:15.750 --> 04:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
report of the house election law
 
04:40:17.990 --> 04:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
committee I support this position
 
04:40:19.750 --> 04:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
because I believe adoption of this
 
04:40:21.510 --> 04:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
method of determining winners and losers
 
04:40:24.430 --> 04:40:24.440 align:start position:0%
in our elections will cause a
 
04:40:26.390 --> 04:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
substantial amount of damage to public
 
04:40:29.030 --> 04:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
trust and confidence in our election law
 
04:40:33.110 --> 04:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:36.750 --> 04:40:36.760 align:start position:0%
laws it's uh the legitimacy of our
 
04:40:39.550 --> 04:40:39.560 align:start position:0%
entire system of governments depends
 
04:40:41.310 --> 04:40:41.320 align:start position:0%
upon having the consent of the
 
04:40:42.948 --> 04:40:42.958 align:start position:0%
government it's is so fundamental of
 
04:40:45.230 --> 04:40:45.240 align:start position:0%
principle that in the Declaration of
 
04:40:47.190 --> 04:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
Independence itself the founders of this
 
04:40:50.670 --> 04:40:50.680 align:start position:0%
country held it to be a self-evident
 
04:40:53.868 --> 04:40:53.878 align:start position:0%
truth that government's just Powers
 
04:40:55.708 --> 04:40:55.718 align:start position:0%
derive from the consent of the
 
04:40:59.788 --> 04:40:59.798 align:start position:0%
government now I see uh some
 
04:41:02.070 --> 04:41:02.080 align:start position:0%
requirements the purpose of our election
 
04:41:06.430 --> 04:41:06.440 align:start position:0%
law system is to ensure we have that
 
04:41:08.990 --> 04:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
consent and the way our election laws
 
04:41:13.230 --> 04:41:13.240 align:start position:0%
fulfill that purpose is by first uh
 
04:41:16.150 --> 04:41:16.160 align:start position:0%
having an making an accurate assessment
 
04:41:18.470 --> 04:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
of the sentiment of the public or the
 
04:41:20.430 --> 04:41:20.440 align:start position:0%
the will of the people as we often call
 
04:41:25.470 --> 04:41:25.480 align:start position:0%
it in doing so in such a way that uh the
 
04:41:27.628 --> 04:41:27.638 align:start position:0%
system retains the confidence and Trust
 
04:41:30.190 --> 04:41:30.200 align:start position:0%
of the public that a proper outcome has
 
04:41:30.200 --> 04:41:31.270 align:start position:0%
of the public that a proper outcome has
been

04:41:31.270 --> 04:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
been
 
04:41:35.270 --> 04:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
achieved I'm going to focus on uh
 
04:41:37.670 --> 04:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
on the need to retain the trust of the
 
04:41:40.150 --> 04:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
public I see three elements that have to
 
04:41:43.590 --> 04:41:43.600 align:start position:0%
be satisfied to do that
 
04:41:46.070 --> 04:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
one our election laws have to be
 
04:41:49.750 --> 04:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
transparent and by transparent I mean
 
04:41:53.910 --> 04:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
they're reibly readily understandable by
 
04:41:57.110 --> 04:41:57.120 align:start position:0%
everybody secondly they have to be
 
04:41:59.310 --> 04:41:59.320 align:start position:0%
impartial and I mean particularly they
 
04:42:02.430 --> 04:42:02.440 align:start position:0%
have to treat all candidates alike in
 
04:42:03.550 --> 04:42:03.560 align:start position:0%
the same
 
04:42:05.590 --> 04:42:05.600 align:start position:0%
fashion and
 
04:42:07.750 --> 04:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
thirdly and I think New Hampshire law
 
04:42:09.110 --> 04:42:09.120 align:start position:0%
has this
 
04:42:11.830 --> 04:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
covered our elections have to come up
 
04:42:14.670 --> 04:42:14.680 align:start position:0%
with a
 
04:42:18.910 --> 04:42:18.920 align:start position:0%
uh an unambiguous result in a timely
 
04:42:21.628 --> 04:42:21.638 align:start position:0%
fashion now I see that the concept
 
04:42:23.590 --> 04:42:23.600 align:start position:0%
itself of rank Choice voting is having
 
04:42:25.628 --> 04:42:25.638 align:start position:0%
some serious flaws in
 
04:42:28.470 --> 04:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
particular with regards to
 
04:42:30.590 --> 04:42:30.600 align:start position:0%
transparency and
 
04:42:32.990 --> 04:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
impartiality let's contrast how the
 
04:42:35.750 --> 04:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
current system determines winners and
 
04:42:39.670 --> 04:42:39.680 align:start position:0%
losers it uses a plurality
 
04:42:41.510 --> 04:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
approach basically that can be
 
04:42:44.150 --> 04:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
summarized as those who get the most
 
04:42:47.830 --> 04:42:47.840 align:start position:0%
votes win most votes wins a three-word
 
04:42:49.550 --> 04:42:49.560 align:start position:0%
algorithm if you
 
04:42:52.150 --> 04:42:52.160 align:start position:0%
will the rank Choice voting proposal
 
04:42:53.750 --> 04:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
before us
 
04:42:57.628 --> 04:42:57.638 align:start position:0%
today takes four pages to describe how
 
04:42:59.990 --> 04:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
they would determine winners and losers
 
04:43:03.030 --> 04:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
a page and a half of that four pages is
 
04:43:06.750 --> 04:43:06.760 align:start position:0%
a list of 17 definitions of new terms
 
04:43:09.270 --> 04:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
which you need to understand in order to
 
04:43:12.788 --> 04:43:12.798 align:start position:0%
understand the two and a half pages of
 
04:43:16.628 --> 04:43:16.638 align:start position:0%
uh explanation that follows and in my
 
04:43:18.390 --> 04:43:18.400 align:start position:0%
view it's even worse than just 17
 
04:43:19.948 --> 04:43:19.958 align:start position:0%
definitions these definitions what I
 
04:43:22.510 --> 04:43:22.520 align:start position:0%
call nested if you read the first
 
04:43:24.868 --> 04:43:24.878 align:start position:0%
definition or the second definition you
 
04:43:26.948 --> 04:43:26.958 align:start position:0%
need to understand new terms that are
 
04:43:29.190 --> 04:43:29.200 align:start position:0%
defined elsewhere in that
 
04:43:31.910 --> 04:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
list this is not simple it's not
 
04:43:34.550 --> 04:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
transparent it's not easy to understand
 
04:43:36.628 --> 04:43:36.638 align:start position:0%
to to me it's as if you took the idea of
 
04:43:38.590 --> 04:43:38.600 align:start position:0%
transparency and threw it out the window
 
04:43:40.070 --> 04:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
and brick the window
 
04:43:44.030 --> 04:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
up uh it's much more complex than most
 
04:43:44.040 --> 04:43:45.230 align:start position:0%
up uh it's much more complex than most
votes

04:43:45.230 --> 04:43:45.240 align:start position:0%
votes
 
04:43:47.788 --> 04:43:47.798 align:start position:0%
wins uh and I know from my own
 
04:43:50.390 --> 04:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
experience in my profession that
 
04:43:54.470 --> 04:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:56.550 --> 04:43:56.560 align:start position:0%
transparency now with regards to
 
04:43:58.510 --> 04:43:58.520 align:start position:0%
transparency we've covered that what
 
04:43:58.520 --> 04:44:01.070 align:start position:0%
transparency we've covered that what
about

04:44:01.070 --> 04:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:44:03.510 --> 04:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
impartiality the proponents of this
 
04:44:05.708 --> 04:44:05.718 align:start position:0%
approach to determine winners and
 
04:44:08.070 --> 04:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
losers uh State
 
04:44:11.070 --> 04:44:11.080 align:start position:0%
themselves that this uh this approach
 
04:44:13.670 --> 04:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
will decrease the spoiler
 
04:44:15.948 --> 04:44:15.958 align:start position:0%
effect now I don't I didn't see a
 
04:44:18.590 --> 04:44:18.600 align:start position:0%
definition of spoiler in their
 
04:44:20.430 --> 04:44:20.440 align:start position:0%
literature but it's clear from Context
 
04:44:21.670 --> 04:44:21.680 align:start position:0%
it a
 
04:44:24.310 --> 04:44:24.320 align:start position:0%
spoiler the people who are promoting
 
04:44:27.830 --> 04:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
this approach would consider a spoiler a
 
04:44:30.390 --> 04:44:30.400 align:start position:0%
person who basically has a low number of
 
04:44:32.868 --> 04:44:32.878 align:start position:0%
votes doesn't have enough votes to win
 
04:44:34.868 --> 04:44:34.878 align:start position:0%
but still affects the outcome
 
04:44:37.990 --> 04:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:40.590 --> 04:44:40.600 align:start position:0%
election the proponents of this bill and
 
04:44:42.788 --> 04:44:42.798 align:start position:0%
proposing to decrease the spoiler effect
 
04:44:46.270 --> 04:44:46.280 align:start position:0%
are in essence saying that this system
 
04:44:48.628 --> 04:44:48.638 align:start position:0%
would decrease the Electoral influence
 
04:44:51.310 --> 04:44:51.320 align:start position:0%
and hence the political influence of
 
04:44:53.390 --> 04:44:53.400 align:start position:0%
candidates who get to would never get
 
04:44:55.430 --> 04:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
enough votes to
 
04:44:58.868 --> 04:44:58.878 align:start position:0%
win it's it's showing a distinct bias in
 
04:45:01.390 --> 04:45:01.400 align:start position:0%
my view against a certain type of
 
04:45:04.830 --> 04:45:04.840 align:start position:0%
candidate another example of uh an in
 
04:45:07.350 --> 04:45:07.360 align:start position:0%
built in bias according to the
 
04:45:09.110 --> 04:45:09.120 align:start position:0%
proponents of this
 
04:45:12.150 --> 04:45:12.160 align:start position:0%
approach uh is that it would uh
 
04:45:15.708 --> 04:45:15.718 align:start position:0%
reward candidates who ran a campaign to
 
04:45:20.750 --> 04:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
appeal to a a broad spectrum of uh
 
04:45:24.390 --> 04:45:24.400 align:start position:0%
opinions well that again is using the
 
04:45:25.910 --> 04:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
electoral system
 
04:45:29.070 --> 04:45:29.080 align:start position:0%
itself to reduce the influence of a
 
04:45:30.990 --> 04:45:31.000 align:start position:0%
certain type of candidate well in my
 
04:45:32.990 --> 04:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
view that's not the job of the electoral
 
04:45:35.470 --> 04:45:35.480 align:start position:0%
system the job of the electoral system
 
04:45:38.788 --> 04:45:38.798 align:start position:0%
or system of election laws is to treat
 
04:45:41.708 --> 04:45:41.718 align:start position:0%
every candidate equally with no inil
 
04:45:44.590 --> 04:45:44.600 align:start position:0%
inbuilt bias and let the voters make the
 
04:45:46.788 --> 04:45:46.798 align:start position:0%
decision on who should have more or less
 
04:45:48.990 --> 04:45:49.000 align:start position:0%
electoral and Hance political
 
04:45:53.310 --> 04:45:53.320 align:start position:0%
influence so to me these are just two
 
04:45:56.868 --> 04:45:56.878 align:start position:0%
examples of serious flaws in this whole
 
04:45:58.550 --> 04:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
concept that
 
04:46:02.150 --> 04:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
would uh by by decreasing transparency
 
04:46:03.868 --> 04:46:03.878 align:start position:0%
and impartiality voters are going to
 
04:46:06.550 --> 04:46:06.560 align:start position:0%
recognize this and it will tend to
 
04:46:08.030 --> 04:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
decrease their
 
04:46:12.070 --> 04:46:12.080 align:start position:0%
trust and confidence in our electoral
 
04:46:15.070 --> 04:46:15.080 align:start position:0%
system and I think will decrease the
 
04:46:17.430 --> 04:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
likelihood of having their informed
 
04:46:20.910 --> 04:46:20.920 align:start position:0%
consent this particular bill is uh
 
04:46:23.708 --> 04:46:23.718 align:start position:0%
enabling rank Choice voting for
 
04:46:27.230 --> 04:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
political party and Municipal
 
04:46:29.350 --> 04:46:29.360 align:start position:0%
elections to me this violates another
 
04:46:30.830 --> 04:46:30.840 align:start position:0%
principle that our election should
 
04:46:34.030 --> 04:46:34.040 align:start position:0%
follow which is that all our voters all
 
04:46:36.670 --> 04:46:36.680 align:start position:0%
our our citizens have the same rights
 
04:46:38.310 --> 04:46:38.320 align:start position:0%
and I think they all should have the
 
04:46:41.470 --> 04:46:41.480 align:start position:0%
same right to an equal degree of
 
04:46:43.670 --> 04:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
transparency and impartiality in the
 
04:46:44.910 --> 04:46:44.920 align:start position:0%
election law
 
04:46:48.910 --> 04:46:48.920 align:start position:0%
system so for these reasons I support
 
04:46:51.590 --> 04:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
the itl motion and I hope you'll join me
 
04:46:55.470 --> 04:46:55.480 align:start position:0%

Speaker Mr
 
04:48:31.510 --> 04:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that rank Choice
 
04:48:33.548 --> 04:48:33.558 align:start position:0%

conscience
 
04:48:37.390 --> 04:48:37.400 align:start position:0%
and if I know that rank Choice voting
 
04:48:40.070 --> 04:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
would spare cities towns and political
 
04:48:42.910 --> 04:48:42.920 align:start position:0%
parties the extra expense when runoff

elections are
 
04:48:47.390 --> 04:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
needed and if I know that rank Choice

04:49:01.350 --> 04:49:01.360 align:start position:0%

Speaker Mr
 
04:51:31.548 --> 04:51:31.558 align:start position:0%
Speaker House Bill 350 would establish
 
04:51:34.030 --> 04:51:34.040 align:start position:0%
rank Choice voting for federal and State
 
04:51:37.190 --> 04:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
elections for primary and general
 
04:51:39.708 --> 04:51:39.718 align:start position:0%
elections my colleague on the other side
 
04:51:42.030 --> 04:51:42.040 align:start position:0%
of the aisle is correct that the
 
04:51:44.470 --> 04:51:44.480 align:start position:0%
legitimacy of our government depends on
 
04:51:47.110 --> 04:51:47.120 align:start position:0%
the consent of the government rank
 
04:51:50.270 --> 04:51:50.280 align:start position:0%
Choice voting improves our current first
 
04:51:53.390 --> 04:51:53.400 align:start position:0%
pass the post election system to better
 
04:51:56.110 --> 04:51:56.120 align:start position:0%
ensure that this consent
 
04:51:59.350 --> 04:51:59.360 align:start position:0%
exists many Americans have lost faith in
 
04:52:02.150 --> 04:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
our elections people think their vote
 
04:52:04.868 --> 04:52:04.878 align:start position:0%
didn't count people see candidates
 
04:52:08.150 --> 04:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
winning with a small percentage of the
 
04:52:11.270 --> 04:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
votes if a candidate wins with 30% of
 
04:52:14.470 --> 04:52:14.480 align:start position:0%
the votes that means 70% of the voters
 
04:52:15.990 --> 04:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
wanted someone
 
04:52:18.750 --> 04:52:18.760 align:start position:0%
else no wonder people are not happy with
 
04:52:21.868 --> 04:52:21.878 align:start position:0%
the outcomes rank Choice voting will fix
 
04:52:21.878 --> 04:52:22.830 align:start position:0%
the outcomes rank Choice voting will fix
these

04:52:22.830 --> 04:52:22.840 align:start position:0%
these
 
04:52:25.310 --> 04:52:25.320 align:start position:0%
problems rank Choice voting is
 
04:52:28.548 --> 04:52:28.558 align:start position:0%
transparent and understandable it is
 
04:52:32.190 --> 04:52:32.200 align:start position:0%
easy to cast a vote you simply rank your
 
04:52:35.270 --> 04:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
choices it is easy to read the tallies
 
04:52:37.590 --> 04:52:37.600 align:start position:0%
of the rounds of counting if there is
 
04:52:41.150 --> 04:52:41.160 align:start position:0%
not a majority winner in the first round
 
04:52:43.910 --> 04:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
is it easy to see how the ultimate
 
04:52:46.948 --> 04:52:46.958 align:start position:0%
winner accumulated votes in each round
 
04:52:48.150 --> 04:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
to reach a
 
04:52:50.708 --> 04:52:50.718 align:start position:0%
majority voters can see that if their
 
04:52:53.548 --> 04:52:53.558 align:start position:0%
first choice did not win their vote is
 
04:52:56.430 --> 04:52:56.440 align:start position:0%
not thrown away their second or third
 
04:52:59.510 --> 04:52:59.520 align:start position:0%

04:54:53.150 --> 04:54:53.160 align:start position:0%
Speaker this bill is almost the same as
 
04:54:55.548 --> 04:54:55.558 align:start position:0%
the bill we talked about
 
04:54:55.558 --> 04:54:57.230 align:start position:0%
the bill we talked about
previously

04:54:57.230 --> 04:54:57.240 align:start position:0%
previously
 
04:55:00.750 --> 04:55:00.760 align:start position:0%
uh instead the difference is that this
 
04:55:03.030 --> 04:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
bill would mandate the use of rank
 
04:55:06.190 --> 04:55:06.200 align:start position:0%
choice voting in state and federal
 
04:55:09.910 --> 04:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
elections all the numerous flaws which I
 
04:55:12.868 --> 04:55:12.878 align:start position:0%
discussed for the previous bill would
 
04:55:16.670 --> 04:55:16.680 align:start position:0%
still apply to the uh to this bill with

one
 
04:55:19.868 --> 04:55:19.878 align:start position:0%
exception uh the exception would be that
 
04:55:22.750 --> 04:55:22.760 align:start position:0%
in this case all voters would be
 
04:55:25.548 --> 04:55:25.558 align:start position:0%
subjected to the loss of transparency
 
04:55:25.558 --> 04:55:26.910 align:start position:0%
subjected to the loss of transparency
and

04:55:26.910 --> 04:55:26.920 align:start position:0%

maer thank you Mr Speaker good afternoon
 
05:03:14.830 --> 05:03:14.840 align:start position:0%
everybody uh today I rise in firm
 
05:03:17.150 --> 05:03:17.160 align:start position:0%
opposition to House Bill
 
05:03:20.350 --> 05:03:20.360 align:start position:0%
463 this legislation in its current form
 
05:03:22.470 --> 05:03:22.480 align:start position:0%
stands in Stark contradiction to the
 
05:03:26.070 --> 05:03:26.080 align:start position:0%
ofal office we took under New Hampshire
 
05:03:29.990 --> 05:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
RSA 42 col1 which binds us to uphold the
 
05:03:32.910 --> 05:03:32.920 align:start position:0%
constitution of our great state this
 
05:03:35.470 --> 05:03:35.480 align:start position:0%
oath is not a mere ceremonial gesture
 
05:03:37.390 --> 05:03:37.400 align:start position:0%
but a solemn commitment to safeguard the
 
05:03:38.910 --> 05:03:38.920 align:start position:0%
foundational principles of our
 
05:03:43.070 --> 05:03:43.080 align:start position:0%
governance system however post Bill 463
 
05:03:45.150 --> 05:03:45.160 align:start position:0%
with its proposed creation of an online
 
05:03:47.670 --> 05:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
election information portal veers us
 
05:03:50.350 --> 05:03:50.360 align:start position:0%
away from these crucial
 
05:03:52.548 --> 05:03:52.558 align:start position:0%
foundations this bill's intentions to
 
05:03:54.670 --> 05:03:54.680 align:start position:0%
modernize our voting system and enhance
 
05:03:56.590 --> 05:03:56.600 align:start position:0%
accessibility are indeed
 
05:03:59.270 --> 05:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
commendable yet it is the execution and
 
05:04:01.390 --> 05:04:01.400 align:start position:0%
the potential constitutional conflicts
 
05:04:04.190 --> 05:04:04.200 align:start position:0%
that raise serious concern s the
 
05:04:06.230 --> 05:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
centralized collection and storage of
 
05:04:08.830 --> 05:04:08.840 align:start position:0%
personal voter information a key aspect
 
05:04:11.470 --> 05:04:11.480 align:start position:0%
of this bill presents significant risks
 
05:04:15.310 --> 05:04:15.320 align:start position:0%
to privacy and data security in an era
 
05:04:17.868 --> 05:04:17.878 align:start position:0%
where digital threats are increasingly
 
05:04:20.350 --> 05:04:20.360 align:start position:0%
prevalent such a move could jeopardize
 
05:04:21.868 --> 05:04:21.878 align:start position:0%
the sensitive information of our
 
05:04:24.628 --> 05:04:24.638 align:start position:0%
citizens thereby infringing upon the
 
05:04:27.548 --> 05:04:27.558 align:start position:0%
right to privacy enshrined in article 2B
 
05:04:28.948 --> 05:04:28.958 align:start position:0%
of our
 
05:04:31.830 --> 05:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
constitution just recently an ABC News
 
05:04:35.548 --> 05:04:35.558 align:start position:0%

05:04:37.548 --> 05:04:37.558 align:start position:0%

being stolen nearly 36 million people
 
05:04:49.190 --> 05:04:49.200 align:start position:0%

05:05:06.230 --> 05:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
stolen such as their contact information
 
05:05:07.750 --> 05:05:07.760 align:start position:0%

Etc in April of 2023 the nashaa school
 
05:05:17.190 --> 05:05:17.200 align:start position:0%
board was hit by a sophisticated Cyber
 
05:05:17.200 --> 05:05:19.510 align:start position:0%
board was hit by a sophisticated Cyber
attack

05:05:19.510 --> 05:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
attack
 
05:05:22.470 --> 05:05:22.480 align:start position:0%
um a school board member said I think
 
05:05:23.990 --> 05:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
it's a horrible thing that this is
 
05:05:25.910 --> 05:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
happening in our world today we were
 
05:05:27.868 --> 05:05:27.878 align:start position:0%
told when we went paperless that the
 
05:05:29.150 --> 05:05:29.160 align:start position:0%
internet was going to be the next
 
05:05:29.160 --> 05:05:30.190 align:start position:0%
internet was going to be the next
greatest

05:05:30.190 --> 05:05:30.200 align:start position:0%
greatest
 
05:05:33.430 --> 05:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
thing but obviously it's not
 
05:05:35.990 --> 05:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
probably should just go back to paper
 
05:05:37.590 --> 05:05:37.600 align:start position:0%
all we have to do is shred it when we're
 
05:05:40.628 --> 05:05:40.638 align:start position:0%
done in August of 2021 the town of
 
05:05:43.510 --> 05:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
Peterboro New Hampshire lost $2.3
 
05:05:45.948 --> 05:05:45.958 align:start position:0%
million in taxpayer money as a result of
 
05:05:47.070 --> 05:05:47.080 align:start position:0%
a Cyber
 
05:05:49.750 --> 05:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
attack the US Secret Service told that
 
05:05:51.910 --> 05:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
town that at least one other community
 
05:05:53.868 --> 05:05:53.878 align:start position:0%
in Northern New England had also been
 
05:05:56.830 --> 05:05:56.840 align:start position:0%
targeted to the tune of
 
05:05:59.548 --> 05:05:59.558 align:start position:0%
$600,000 in California the Secretary of
 
05:06:01.230 --> 05:06:01.240 align:start position:0%
State's office investigated how
 
05:06:04.868 --> 05:06:04.878 align:start position:0%
information of 100 91 million voters was
 
05:06:06.948 --> 05:06:06.958 align:start position:0%
exposed to the open internet due to a
 
05:06:09.750 --> 05:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
misconfiguration of a database there's a
 
05:06:12.030 --> 05:06:12.040 align:start position:0%
hundred more examples but you get the
 
05:06:15.070 --> 05:06:15.080 align:start position:0%
idea uh moreover this bill's lack of
 
05:06:17.590 --> 05:06:17.600 align:start position:0%
clear oversight mechanisms brings into
 
05:06:19.030 --> 05:06:19.040 align:start position:0%
question the accountability of
 
05:06:21.430 --> 05:06:21.440 align:start position:0%
government as outlined in article 8 of
 
05:06:21.440 --> 05:06:22.270 align:start position:0%
government as outlined in article 8 of
our

05:06:22.270 --> 05:06:22.280 align:start position:0%
our
 
05:06:24.310 --> 05:06:24.320 align:start position:0%
constitution the concentration of
 
05:06:25.990 --> 05:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
sensitive electoral data without
 
05:06:27.990 --> 05:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
stringent oversight mechanisms is a
 
05:06:30.190 --> 05:06:30.200 align:start position:0%
potential recipe for misuse of
 
05:06:32.670 --> 05:06:32.680 align:start position:0%
information and the further erosion of
 
05:06:36.150 --> 05:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
public trust in our electoral
 
05:06:38.590 --> 05:06:38.600 align:start position:0%
processes Additionally the potential
 
05:06:41.030 --> 05:06:41.040 align:start position:0%
restriction of portal access to specific
 
05:06:43.868 --> 05:06:43.878 align:start position:0%
groups of people raises issues regarding
 
05:06:46.548 --> 05:06:46.558 align:start position:0%
equal representation a Cornerstone of
 
05:06:48.990 --> 05:06:49.000 align:start position:0%
our Republic underlined in part one
 
05:06:51.390 --> 05:06:51.400 align:start position:0%
article 14 of the New Hampshire
 
05:06:53.708 --> 05:06:53.718 align:start position:0%
Constitution by creating disperate
 
05:06:57.350 --> 05:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
access to the electoral process HB 463
 
05:06:59.590 --> 05:06:59.600 align:start position:0%
May inadvertently lead to unequal
 
05:07:01.948 --> 05:07:01.958 align:start position:0%
representation and participation in our
 
05:07:03.470 --> 05:07:03.480 align:start position:0%
Democrat atic
 
05:07:05.708 --> 05:07:05.718 align:start position:0%
process given these significant
 
05:07:08.110 --> 05:07:08.120 align:start position:0%
constitutional concerns I argue that
 
05:07:11.230 --> 05:07:11.240 align:start position:0%
addressing the issues raised by 463 goes
 
05:07:13.910 --> 05:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
beyond legislative action and calls for
 
05:07:16.548 --> 05:07:16.558 align:start position:0%
a constitutional amendment as prescribed
 
05:07:19.788 --> 05:07:19.798 align:start position:0%
in part one or part two article 100 of
 
05:07:22.030 --> 05:07:22.040 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Constitution this is
 
05:07:24.390 --> 05:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
not just about policy preferences it's
 
05:07:26.350 --> 05:07:26.360 align:start position:0%
about adhering to our constitutional
 
05:07:28.788 --> 05:07:28.798 align:start position:0%
duties and ensuring the Integrity of the
 
05:07:31.670 --> 05:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
electoral system here in New Hampshire
 
05:07:34.750 --> 05:07:34.760 align:start position:0%
in conclusion while the goal of HB 463
 
05:07:37.270 --> 05:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
is to advance our electoral processes
 
05:07:39.548 --> 05:07:39.558 align:start position:0%
its current form poses risks to our
 
05:07:42.150 --> 05:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
constitutional mandates we must seek
 
05:07:43.868 --> 05:07:43.878 align:start position:0%
solutions that both preserve our
 
05:07:45.750 --> 05:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights and Foster
 
05:07:48.150 --> 05:07:48.160 align:start position:0%
progress in our electoral system
 
05:07:50.270 --> 05:07:50.280 align:start position:0%
therefore I urge my fellow legislators
 
05:07:53.030 --> 05:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
to vote no on this bill and explore
 
05:07:54.350 --> 05:07:54.360 align:start position:0%
solutions that align with our
 
05:07:56.310 --> 05:07:56.320 align:start position:0%
constitutional principles and the oath
 
05:07:59.230 --> 05:07:59.240 align:start position:0%
we have all sworn to uphold I also ask
 
05:08:02.948 --> 05:08:02.958 align:start position:0%
for a roll call vote thank you
 
05:08:08.628 --> 05:08:08.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:12.190 --> 05:08:12.200 align:start position:0%
wood thank you Mr speaker thank you
 
05:08:14.548 --> 05:08:14.558 align:start position:0%
fellow colleagues I come here in
 
05:08:18.670 --> 05:08:18.680 align:start position:0%
opposition of HB 464 I'll take a little
 
05:08:20.628 --> 05:08:20.638 align:start position:0%
different approach than uh my
 
05:08:24.390 --> 05:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
predecessor before me uh basically um
 
05:08:27.070 --> 05:08:27.080 align:start position:0%
looking at the testimony at the original
 
05:08:28.948 --> 05:08:28.958 align:start position:0%
Bill there was a lot of good reasons to
 
05:08:31.830 --> 05:08:31.840 align:start position:0%
have a portal pretty much save paper
 
05:08:34.030 --> 05:08:34.040 align:start position:0%
collect data easily make things easier
 
05:08:36.390 --> 05:08:36.400 align:start position:0%
to read make things easier to change
 
05:08:38.190 --> 05:08:38.200 align:start position:0%
these are the standard reasons why
 
05:08:39.430 --> 05:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
people create
 
05:08:42.390 --> 05:08:42.400 align:start position:0%
portals um this is one topic I do have
 
05:08:46.470 --> 05:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
some knowledge of and the uh details are
 
05:08:50.070 --> 05:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
the devil of of of any portal uh what
 
05:08:52.990 --> 05:08:53.000 align:start position:0%
did come up in the discussion was
 
05:08:55.070 --> 05:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
concerns about being connected to the
 
05:08:58.350 --> 05:08:58.360 align:start position:0%
internet the obvious security concerns
 
05:09:00.430 --> 05:09:00.440 align:start position:0%
and also just the validation of data to
 
05:09:02.390 --> 05:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
make sure we know we're getting the
 
05:09:05.628 --> 05:09:05.638 align:start position:0%
right uh material from the right people
 
05:09:07.868 --> 05:09:07.878 align:start position:0%
um none of those were addressed in the
 
05:09:09.270 --> 05:09:09.280 align:start position:0%
amendment the amendment is actually
 
05:09:12.230 --> 05:09:12.240 align:start position:0%
quite interesting it doesn't address any
 
05:09:14.868 --> 05:09:14.878 align:start position:0%
details or standards to follow When
 
05:09:16.948 --> 05:09:16.958 align:start position:0%
developing a portal which is something
 
05:09:19.750 --> 05:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
that has to be included how is this data
 
05:09:21.708 --> 05:09:21.718 align:start position:0%
going to be validated it doesn't have to
 
05:09:24.110 --> 05:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
be done to the bit level but you have to
 
05:09:26.830 --> 05:09:26.840 align:start position:0%
know if you go into it a what we call a
 
05:09:29.830 --> 05:09:29.840 align:start position:0%
proven standard uh when you look at a
 
05:09:32.990 --> 05:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
lot of the discussion at the election
 
05:09:35.948 --> 05:09:35.958 align:start position:0%
law committee uh it makes it sound like
 
05:09:38.110 --> 05:09:38.120 align:start position:0%
we should already have a portal uh these
 
05:09:41.270 --> 05:09:41.280 align:start position:0%
things are all over the place being used
 
05:09:43.270 --> 05:09:43.280 align:start position:0%
standards are different in every portal
 
05:09:45.510 --> 05:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
not all portals are the same if your
 
05:09:48.708 --> 05:09:48.718 align:start position:0%
bank uses a system I'm sure your digital
 
05:09:50.750 --> 05:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
signature is traceable to a proven
 
05:09:53.390 --> 05:09:53.400 align:start position:0%
standard that is not a trivial thing to
 
05:09:56.430 --> 05:09:56.440 align:start position:0%
do the uh Amendment brought up a couple
 
05:09:58.670 --> 05:09:58.680 align:start position:0%
issues that I found interesting from the
 
05:10:02.150 --> 05:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
technical point of view as amended we
 
05:10:04.510 --> 05:10:04.520 align:start position:0%
remove verification by identification
 
05:10:08.390 --> 05:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
age or domicile by affidavit under RSA
 
05:10:08.400 --> 05:10:09.910 align:start position:0%
age or domicile by affidavit under RSA
654

05:10:09.910 --> 05:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
654
 
05:10:12.788 --> 05:10:12.798 align:start position:0%
col2 now I can understand that because
 
05:10:14.830 --> 05:10:14.840 align:start position:0%
by understanding affidavit it has to be
 
05:10:17.510 --> 05:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
witnessed very difficult to do on the
 
05:10:20.350 --> 05:10:20.360 align:start position:0%
internet it also showed another problem
 
05:10:23.350 --> 05:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
Federal Law requires that had a sworn
 
05:10:25.708 --> 05:10:25.718 align:start position:0%
statement be used for citizenship
 
05:10:27.990 --> 05:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
supposedly citizenship is expensive
 
05:10:30.510 --> 05:10:30.520 align:start position:0%
thing this is what I heard in testimony
 
05:10:33.910 --> 05:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
it's an exp EXP expensive thing to prove
 
05:10:36.670 --> 05:10:36.680 align:start position:0%
uh here's a case where this should be
 
05:10:37.990 --> 05:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
addressed with the portal it should be
 
05:10:40.788 --> 05:10:40.798 align:start position:0%
addressed to a standard uh but no no
 
05:10:42.230 --> 05:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
standard was given is it going to be
 
05:10:44.788 --> 05:10:44.798 align:start position:0%
mely a checkbox that we check every time
 
05:10:47.628 --> 05:10:47.638 align:start position:0%
we go onto a new website and we do a
 
05:10:49.470 --> 05:10:49.480 align:start position:0%
checkbox validation or is it going to be
 
05:10:51.868 --> 05:10:51.878 align:start position:0%
something that really means anything I
 
05:10:53.910 --> 05:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
don't have I I am on the election law
 
05:10:55.390 --> 05:10:55.400 align:start position:0%
committee and I can't tell you that
 
05:10:58.310 --> 05:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
answer so basically the last thing that
 
05:11:01.470 --> 05:11:01.480 align:start position:0%
I so so technically we got a lot of
 
05:11:03.670 --> 05:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
things to talk about and whether we have
 
05:11:06.628 --> 05:11:06.638 align:start position:0%
a portal or don't have a portal uh we we
 
05:11:08.868 --> 05:11:08.878 align:start position:0%
need to know what it can do and what it
 
05:11:11.670 --> 05:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
can't do and that I don't think anybody
 
05:11:14.868 --> 05:11:14.878 align:start position:0%
can tell you um the interesting thing
 
05:11:17.548 --> 05:11:17.558 align:start position:0%
was it took out an interesting part of
 
05:11:21.390 --> 05:11:21.400 align:start position:0%
handling and the validation of the data
 
05:11:23.270 --> 05:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
uh what we found out if you read the
 
05:11:27.310 --> 05:11:27.320 align:start position:0%
committee's report on the on uh special
 
05:11:29.590 --> 05:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
committee on voter
 
05:11:32.030 --> 05:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
confidence the people who are confident
 
05:11:34.830 --> 05:11:34.840 align:start position:0%
in our committee in our process sorry
 
05:11:37.670 --> 05:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
are people who deal with the locals all
 
05:11:41.190 --> 05:11:41.200 align:start position:0%
the time uh the the biggest area of
 
05:11:43.750 --> 05:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
confidence comes from the fact that they
 
05:11:46.430 --> 05:11:46.440 align:start position:0%
know the people handling the data uh
 
05:11:48.868 --> 05:11:48.878 align:start position:0%
when I try to challenge anything uh
 
05:11:50.788 --> 05:11:50.798 align:start position:0%
people say oh that can't be handling in
 
05:11:53.230 --> 05:11:53.240 align:start position:0%
our town because we Mary does such a
 
05:11:54.990 --> 05:11:55.000 align:start position:0%
great job she's been doing it for 20
 
05:11:58.230 --> 05:11:58.240 align:start position:0%
years now we get these people that we
 
05:12:00.670 --> 05:12:00.680 align:start position:0%
want to increase the voter's confidence
 
05:12:02.910 --> 05:12:02.920 align:start position:0%
that's what came out of this report so
 
05:12:07.868 --> 05:12:07.878 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming that's one of our our our
 
05:12:11.750 --> 05:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
objection our uh lost my mind sorry uh
 
05:12:13.868 --> 05:12:13.878 align:start position:0%
one of our purposes uh we're taking that
 
05:12:15.990 --> 05:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
away we're taking that Hands-On quality
 
05:12:18.110 --> 05:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
that we have right now even though there
 
05:12:21.310 --> 05:12:21.320 align:start position:0%
our problems that is a big confidence
 
05:12:24.708 --> 05:12:24.718 align:start position:0%
Factor So based on confidence and the
 
05:12:27.548 --> 05:12:27.558 align:start position:0%
concerns I believe that if we put one of
 
05:12:29.830 --> 05:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
these things together we have to have
 
05:12:32.910 --> 05:12:32.920 align:start position:0%
more focus on oversight verification
 
05:12:35.910 --> 05:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
standards and details and for those
 
05:12:37.830 --> 05:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
reasons until that bill comes along I
 
05:12:48.708 --> 05:12:48.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:51.708 --> 05:12:51.718 align:start position:0%

testimony about limited access to town

clerk's offices especially in our small
 
05:14:50.628 --> 05:14:50.638 align:start position:0%
rural towns that may only be open a few
 
05:14:53.470 --> 05:14:53.480 align:start position:0%
hours a week making it particularly
 
05:14:55.868 --> 05:14:55.878 align:start position:0%

05:15:17.510 --> 05:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
the desire of election officials to make
 
05:15:18.948 --> 05:15:18.958 align:start position:0%
things more

portal committee members in the minority
 
05:15:43.750 --> 05:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
raised concerns about
 
05:15:47.670 --> 05:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
security but in a bipartisan fashion the
 
05:15:49.548 --> 05:15:49.558 align:start position:0%
committee provided an additional layer
 
05:15:52.150 --> 05:15:52.160 align:start position:0%
of security to alleviate the worries by
 
05:15:54.788 --> 05:15:54.798 align:start position:0%
adopting an amendment that prohibits an

05:16:15.190 --> 05:16:15.200 align:start position:0%
maintaining oversight and integrity in
 
05:16:17.830 --> 05:16:17.840 align:start position:0%

amendment Bixby has recognized to speak
 
05:24:59.990 --> 05:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
to the amendment so uh the floor
 
05:25:02.910 --> 05:25:02.920 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh is was the result of a
 
05:25:05.350 --> 05:25:05.360 align:start position:0%
conversation I had with the member from
 
05:25:07.510 --> 05:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
uh Barnstead and the former chair of my
 
05:25:09.430 --> 05:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
committee who now is uh in the body on
 
05:25:11.948 --> 05:25:11.958 align:start position:0%
the other side of the wall uh what the
 
05:25:13.390 --> 05:25:13.400 align:start position:0%
commit the committee Amendment Narrows
 
05:25:16.070 --> 05:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
the definition of a farmer uh narrower
 
05:25:18.590 --> 05:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
than what is currently in State Statute
 
05:25:22.750 --> 05:25:22.760 align:start position:0%
and um my uh colleagues pointed out that
 
05:25:26.070 --> 05:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
this could inadvertently uh exclude uh
 
05:25:28.990 --> 05:25:29.000 align:start position:0%
New farmers and be uh small farmers from
 
05:25:31.310 --> 05:25:31.320 align:start position:0%
the program and they would in fact be
 
05:25:33.190 --> 05:25:33.200 align:start position:0%
some of the most appropriate
 
05:25:36.390 --> 05:25:36.400 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries so what the uh floor
 
05:25:39.590 --> 05:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
Amendment does is it simply um makes the
 
05:25:42.750 --> 05:25:42.760 align:start position:0%
definition of farmer uh consistent with
 
05:25:46.350 --> 05:25:46.360 align:start position:0%
the current definition under RSA uh 21
 
05:25:49.470 --> 05:25:49.480 align:start position:0%

verville thank you Mr Speaker good
 
05:26:25.948 --> 05:26:25.958 align:start position:0%
afternoon uh honorable colleagues uh I
 
05:26:29.750 --> 05:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
rise in opposition to House Bill uh 369
 
05:26:31.708 --> 05:26:31.718 align:start position:0%
and and I oppose this bill for for
 
05:26:34.150 --> 05:26:34.160 align:start position:0%
several reasons uh I won't it's I won't
 
05:26:36.190 --> 05:26:36.200 align:start position:0%
take up too much of your time but one of
 
05:26:38.110 --> 05:26:38.120 align:start position:0%
the things that this bill
 
05:26:41.470 --> 05:26:41.480 align:start position:0%
does is it creates
 
05:26:43.590 --> 05:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
duplicative uh efforts and and
 
05:26:46.628 --> 05:26:46.638 align:start position:0%
opportunities so all the things that
 
05:26:50.510 --> 05:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
this bill proposes to do are currently
 
05:26:52.708 --> 05:26:52.718 align:start position:0%
available all those Services all that
 
05:26:55.990 --> 05:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
information is available uh from other
 
05:26:59.670 --> 05:26:59.680 align:start position:0%
sources today so what this bill wants to
 
05:27:02.910 --> 05:27:02.920 align:start position:0%
do is it wants to spend
 
05:27:05.628 --> 05:27:05.638 align:start position:0%
$100,000 to contract with
 
05:27:09.910 --> 05:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
UNH to have yet another source of all of
 
05:27:09.920 --> 05:27:10.750 align:start position:0%
UNH to have yet another source of all of
that

05:27:10.750 --> 05:27:10.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:27:13.948 --> 05:27:13.958 align:start position:0%
information and last I checked um last
 
05:27:17.270 --> 05:27:17.280 align:start position:0%
year was the budgeting year and next
 
05:27:20.110 --> 05:27:20.120 align:start position:0%
year will be another budgeting year and
 
05:27:22.470 --> 05:27:22.480 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying that maybe this isn't a
 
05:27:25.430 --> 05:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
priority but it is not such a priority
 
05:27:27.910 --> 05:27:27.920 align:start position:0%
that we need to be spending
 
05:27:31.310 --> 05:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
$100,000 to make duplicative uh
 
05:27:34.868 --> 05:27:34.878 align:start position:0%
information available so I would say to
 
05:27:37.670 --> 05:27:37.680 align:start position:0%
the people that that support this bill
 
05:27:39.510 --> 05:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
it should be brought back during the
 
05:27:42.868 --> 05:27:42.878 align:start position:0%
normal budgeting process and funded and
 
05:27:42.878 --> 05:27:44.270 align:start position:0%
normal budgeting process and funded and
funded

05:27:44.270 --> 05:27:44.280 align:start position:0%
funded
 
05:27:48.390 --> 05:27:48.400 align:start position:0%
then my other challenge is that it's
 
05:27:51.590 --> 05:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
very narrowly focused right so this is
 
05:27:55.510 --> 05:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
for Energy Efficiency this is um for
 
05:27:58.070 --> 05:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
alternative energies you know so-called
 
05:28:01.110 --> 05:28:01.120 align:start position:0%
green energies uh and things like that
 
05:28:04.030 --> 05:28:04.040 align:start position:0%
but but focused only to
 
05:28:06.270 --> 05:28:06.280 align:start position:0%
Farmers Only to
 
05:28:09.270 --> 05:28:09.280 align:start position:0%
farms and not to the average citizen
 
05:28:11.750 --> 05:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
that could also benefit from this
 
05:28:13.788 --> 05:28:13.798 align:start position:0%
information but of course they can go
 
05:28:15.788 --> 05:28:15.798 align:start position:0%
get that information in a whole lot of
 
05:28:17.350 --> 05:28:17.360 align:start position:0%
other places because all this
 
05:28:20.788 --> 05:28:20.798 align:start position:0%
information is currently available so we
 
05:28:24.270 --> 05:28:24.280 align:start position:0%
want to spend $100,000 to contract with
 
05:28:27.788 --> 05:28:27.798 align:start position:0%
un to bundle publicly available readily
 
05:28:30.390 --> 05:28:30.400 align:start position:0%
available information and funnel it only
 
05:28:33.510 --> 05:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
only to to
 
05:28:36.868 --> 05:28:36.878 align:start position:0%
Farmers that to me is not a good use of
 
05:28:40.628 --> 05:28:40.638 align:start position:0%
time it's not a good use of of money and
 
05:28:44.830 --> 05:28:44.840 align:start position:0%
so for that reason I would ask you uh to
 
05:28:47.230 --> 05:28:47.240 align:start position:0%
to press the shiny red
 
05:28:50.670 --> 05:28:50.680 align:start position:0%
button uh to oppose the ought to pass so
 
05:28:53.270 --> 05:28:53.280 align:start position:0%
that another motion can be made thank
 
05:28:55.070 --> 05:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
you Mr
 
05:28:59.310 --> 05:28:59.320 align:start position:0%
Speaker you recognize her representative
 
05:28:59.320 --> 05:29:02.270 align:start position:0%
Speaker you recognize her representative
Bixby

05:29:02.270 --> 05:29:02.280 align:start position:0%
Bixby
 
05:29:05.510 --> 05:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker the bottom line for
 
05:29:09.070 --> 05:29:09.080 align:start position:0%
HB 369 as amended is that it will help
 
05:29:11.548 --> 05:29:11.558 align:start position:0%
farmers get USDA and other grants that
 
05:29:13.990 --> 05:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
will significantly reduce their energy
 
05:29:17.150 --> 05:29:17.160 align:start position:0%
costs the USDA Rural energy for America
 
05:29:20.150 --> 05:29:20.160 align:start position:0%
program uh reap grants are available
 
05:29:23.030 --> 05:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
from uh to rural farms and small
 
05:29:24.868 --> 05:29:24.878 align:start position:0%
businesses and small businesses are
 
05:29:27.548 --> 05:29:27.558 align:start position:0%
defined with businesses that uh make up
 
05:29:31.150 --> 05:29:31.160 align:start position:0%
to $50 million a year uh and and in New
 
05:29:33.110 --> 05:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Farms are a very small
 
05:29:37.230 --> 05:29:37.240 align:start position:0%
fraction of the grant recipients this is
 
05:29:40.390 --> 05:29:40.400 align:start position:0%
because small larger small businesses
 
05:29:44.628 --> 05:29:44.638 align:start position:0%
have the staff and time available to uh
 
05:29:47.230 --> 05:29:47.240 align:start position:0%
to really design and uh fulfill the
 
05:29:49.990 --> 05:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
application process small farms don't
 
05:29:52.830 --> 05:29:52.840 align:start position:0%
really have this luxury uh they are
 
05:29:55.150 --> 05:29:55.160 align:start position:0%
generally running on very short staff
 
05:29:58.270 --> 05:29:58.280 align:start position:0%
farmers are um busy doing all the
 
05:30:00.350 --> 05:30:00.360 align:start position:0%
business of the farm they don't have as
 
05:30:03.150 --> 05:30:03.160 align:start position:0%
much time to do the research necessary
 
05:30:05.750 --> 05:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
to get these uh grants what the bill
 
05:30:07.548 --> 05:30:07.558 align:start position:0%
does is it provides a Cooperative
 
05:30:09.788 --> 05:30:09.798 align:start position:0%
Extension field specialist contracted
 
05:30:11.868 --> 05:30:11.878 align:start position:0%
through the Department of Agriculture to
 
05:30:15.150 --> 05:30:15.160 align:start position:0%
provide advice for Farmers on uh energy
 
05:30:17.190 --> 05:30:17.200 align:start position:0%
and and on on Farm energy and
 
05:30:19.788 --> 05:30:19.798 align:start position:0%
engineering design identify resources
 
05:30:21.670 --> 05:30:21.680 align:start position:0%
identify grants and loans that are
 
05:30:24.430 --> 05:30:24.440 align:start position:0%
available and line up the resources to
 
05:30:26.470 --> 05:30:26.480 align:start position:0%
help with the application
 
05:30:29.750 --> 05:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
process a key advantage of advice from
 
05:30:31.390 --> 05:30:31.400 align:start position:0%
uh the EXT extension rather than from a
 
05:30:33.628 --> 05:30:33.638 align:start position:0%
vendor is that the extension has
 
05:30:35.750 --> 05:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
experienced looking at the whole Farm
 
05:30:38.548 --> 05:30:38.558 align:start position:0%
context and uh figuring out how to
 
05:30:41.230 --> 05:30:41.240 align:start position:0%
maximize Farm efficiencies so this is
 
05:30:43.628 --> 05:30:43.638 align:start position:0%
something that's really critical for New
 
05:30:43.638 --> 05:30:44.590 align:start position:0%
something that's really critical for New
Hampshire

05:30:44.590 --> 05:30:44.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:30:46.548 --> 05:30:46.558 align:start position:0%
agriculture if we want New Hampshire
 
05:30:48.430 --> 05:30:48.440 align:start position:0%
agriculture to thrive and to provide a
 
05:30:50.788 --> 05:30:50.798 align:start position:0%
larger uh percentage of the food that we
 
05:30:54.030 --> 05:30:54.040 align:start position:0%
now eat and New Hampshire is way behind
 
05:30:55.788 --> 05:30:55.798 align:start position:0%
even our neighboring states in terms of
 
05:30:57.750 --> 05:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
how much we our Farms are able to
 
05:31:01.670 --> 05:31:01.680 align:start position:0%
provide for uh uh in terms of our uh
 
05:31:01.680 --> 05:31:03.070 align:start position:0%
provide for uh uh in terms of our uh
food

05:31:03.070 --> 05:31:03.080 align:start position:0%
food
 
05:31:06.788 --> 05:31:06.798 align:start position:0%
budgets uh so if if we want to support
 
05:31:08.670 --> 05:31:08.680 align:start position:0%
our Farmers we need to provide Farms
 
05:31:10.150 --> 05:31:10.160 align:start position:0%
with the leverage they need to become
 
05:31:11.470 --> 05:31:11.480 align:start position:0%
more efficient and
 
05:31:13.910 --> 05:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
productive and providing an engineer
 
05:31:16.270 --> 05:31:16.280 align:start position:0%
engineering and field advisor for New
 
05:31:18.270 --> 05:31:18.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Farms will result in a
 
05:31:20.708 --> 05:31:20.718 align:start position:0%
substantially longterm in substantial
 
05:31:22.708 --> 05:31:22.718 align:start position:0%
long-term cost savings for New Hampshire
 
05:31:26.628 --> 05:31:26.638 align:start position:0%
Farms please vote Yes to support our
 
05:31:28.470 --> 05:31:28.480 align:start position:0%

cour thank you Mr
 
05:33:58.350 --> 05:33:58.360 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr Speaker if I know that this
 
05:34:01.190 --> 05:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
bill is not ready for prime time as the
 
05:34:03.750 --> 05:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
amendment brought forth does not address
 
05:34:06.150 --> 05:34:06.160 align:start position:0%
all the concerns the committee
 
05:34:09.590 --> 05:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
had and if I know that every County
 
05:34:11.910 --> 05:34:11.920 align:start position:0%
already contributes to UNH extension
 
05:34:14.910 --> 05:34:14.920 align:start position:0%
whom this money is slated for by all New
 
05:34:14.920 --> 05:34:16.070 align:start position:0%

taxpayers and finally Mr Speaker if I
 
05:34:22.150 --> 05:34:22.160 align:start position:0%
know that just last week the New

Hampshire Farm Bureau sent out
 
05:34:26.270 --> 05:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
information about an on Farm solo
 
05:34:30.628 --> 05:34:30.638 align:start position:0%
webinar with funding for this provided
 
05:34:33.868 --> 05:34:33.878 align:start position:0%
by top transition to organic
 
05:34:36.430 --> 05:34:36.440 align:start position:0%
partnership NOA New
 
05:34:39.990 --> 05:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the department of a
 
05:34:41.910 --> 05:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
proving that there are already several
 
05:34:43.708 --> 05:34:43.718 align:start position:0%
resources available to New Hampshire
 
05:34:46.868 --> 05:34:46.878 align:start position:0%
Farmers interested in Energy Efficiency
 
05:34:49.510 --> 05:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
and climate resilience would I now push
 
05:34:51.070 --> 05:34:51.080 align:start position:0%
the red
 
05:34:53.830 --> 05:34:53.840 align:start position:0%

chair recognized representative McGee
 
05:34:58.788 --> 05:34:58.798 align:start position:0%
for a parliamentary inquiry thank you Mr
 
05:35:01.910 --> 05:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that this bill is the
 
05:35:04.270 --> 05:35:04.280 align:start position:0%
result of a Seventh Generation New
 
05:35:06.788 --> 05:35:06.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire farmer who wanted to know why
 
05:35:08.708 --> 05:35:08.718 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire wasn't
 
05:35:11.030 --> 05:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
helping Farmers to lower their enormous
 
05:35:14.190 --> 05:35:14.200 align:start position:0%
energy costs when he had a friend who
 
05:35:17.430 --> 05:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
was powering his entire operation uh
 
05:35:21.110 --> 05:35:21.120 align:start position:0%
with tracking solar arrays um and he was
 
05:35:24.670 --> 05:35:24.680 align:start position:0%
jealous basically um and if I know that
 
05:35:27.150 --> 05:35:27.160 align:start position:0%
this bill was vetted by the Department
 
05:35:29.350 --> 05:35:29.360 align:start position:0%
of Agriculture and then retained in
 
05:35:29.360 --> 05:35:30.708 align:start position:0%
of Agriculture and then retained in
committee

05:35:30.708 --> 05:35:30.718 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:35:35.430 --> 05:35:35.440 align:start position:0%
and um amended to enable the UNH
 
05:35:38.190 --> 05:35:38.200 align:start position:0%
Cooperative Extension to hire an advisor
 
05:35:40.470 --> 05:35:40.480 align:start position:0%
that would provide Farmers with advice
 
05:35:44.670 --> 05:35:44.680 align:start position:0%
on design funding and project planning
 
05:35:47.230 --> 05:35:47.240 align:start position:0%
for current Energy Technologies that
 
05:35:49.190 --> 05:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
could help them lower their bills and
 
05:35:50.590 --> 05:35:50.600 align:start position:0%
keep them in
 
05:35:53.350 --> 05:35:53.360 align:start position:0%
business and if I know that this bill as
 
05:35:56.510 --> 05:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
amended directly impacts whether both
 
05:35:57.708 --> 05:35:57.718 align:start position:0%
new and
 
05:36:00.110 --> 05:36:00.120 align:start position:0%
longstanding and established Family
 
05:36:03.110 --> 05:36:03.120 align:start position:0%
Farms are able to continue providing us
 
05:36:05.430 --> 05:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
with locally grown produce which
 
05:36:08.110 --> 05:36:08.120 align:start position:0%
improves our quality of life our
 
05:36:11.510 --> 05:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
security and helps lower their costs and
 
05:36:14.390 --> 05:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
therefore our costs then would I now
 
05:36:16.990 --> 05:36:17.000 align:start position:0%
press the green button to create one
 
05:36:19.830 --> 05:36:19.840 align:start position:0%
position at the co-op extension to help
 
05:36:22.868 --> 05:36:22.878 align:start position:0%
farmers navigate cost-saving measures
 
05:36:24.150 --> 05:36:24.160 align:start position:0%
through the approval of the New
 
05:36:26.310 --> 05:36:26.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Farm Energy Systems advisory
 
05:36:28.670 --> 05:36:28.680 align:start position:0%
program which they would otherwise not
 
05:36:31.590 --> 05:36:31.600 align:start position:0%
have the time to be able to take the
 
05:36:35.030 --> 05:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
energy to look into and centralize um
 
05:36:37.070 --> 05:36:37.080 align:start position:0%
without this program and having the
 
05:36:38.590 --> 05:36:38.600 align:start position:0%
advice in one place where they know how
 
05:36:40.628 --> 05:36:40.638 align:start position:0%
to get it thank
 
05:36:43.230 --> 05:36:43.240 align:start position:0%

this amendment of HB 602 uh provides
 
05:43:39.468 --> 05:43:39.478 align:start position:0%
requested guidance and direction for the
 
05:43:42.670 --> 05:43:42.680 align:start position:0%
state agency which is Dees and is pro
 
05:43:44.468 --> 05:43:44.478 align:start position:0%
business for the industry by
 
05:43:47.150 --> 05:43:47.160 align:start position:0%
implementing a preliminary application
 
05:43:49.590 --> 05:43:49.600 align:start position:0%
into das's new permitting rules in the
 
05:43:52.110 --> 05:43:52.120 align:start position:0%
process currently New Hampshire's
 
05:43:54.430 --> 05:43:54.440 align:start position:0%
landfill application process requires
 
05:43:57.670 --> 05:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
the developer to submit each permit air
 
05:44:02.468 --> 05:44:02.478 align:start position:0%
Wetlands solid bed etc in full before
 
05:44:06.390 --> 05:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
Dees will R will review it this can be
 
05:44:08.548 --> 05:44:08.558 align:start position:0%
very costly to the developer and to the
 
05:44:11.350 --> 05:44:11.360 align:start position:0%
state as thousands of person hours in
 
05:44:13.750 --> 05:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
staff and time are needed to rev review
 
05:44:16.310 --> 05:44:16.320 align:start position:0%
a full application New Hampshire has
 
05:44:18.310 --> 05:44:18.320 align:start position:0%
been lagging behind Most states for
 
05:44:20.590 --> 05:44:20.600 align:start position:0%
decades with their permitting process
 
05:44:22.468 --> 05:44:22.478 align:start position:0%
this bill brings New Hampshire in line
 
05:44:24.670 --> 05:44:24.680 align:start position:0%
with a two-phase permit process that
 
05:44:28.270 --> 05:44:28.280 align:start position:0%
will save both private and public money
 
05:44:30.590 --> 05:44:30.600 align:start position:0%
hearing from Dees employee after this
 
05:44:33.070 --> 05:44:33.080 align:start position:0%
amendment was proposed in our committee
 
05:44:36.548 --> 05:44:36.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:38.948 --> 05:44:38.958 align:start position:0%
13-6 um even though they had they are
 
05:44:40.948 --> 05:44:40.958 align:start position:0%
not publicly allowed of course to speak
 
05:44:43.708 --> 05:44:43.718 align:start position:0%
for or against legislation the employees
 
05:44:45.310 --> 05:44:45.320 align:start position:0%
stated that they were happy this
 
05:44:48.030 --> 05:44:48.040 align:start position:0%
legislation was moving forward the main
 
05:44:50.270 --> 05:44:50.280 align:start position:0%
reason was because the industry is
 
05:44:53.430 --> 05:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
putting pressure on Dees before
 
05:44:56.190 --> 05:44:56.200 align:start position:0%
submitting applications asking questions
 
05:45:00.070 --> 05:45:00.080 align:start position:0%
about proposed locations this two-phase
 
05:45:02.310 --> 05:45:02.320 align:start position:0%
permit process can help eliminate
 
05:45:04.788 --> 05:45:04.798 align:start position:0%
eliminate the lobbying efforts which is
 
05:45:07.628 --> 05:45:07.638 align:start position:0%
putting Dees employees in uncomfortable
 
05:45:11.230 --> 05:45:11.240 align:start position:0%
positions this bill bill Milly asks Dees
 
05:45:13.310 --> 05:45:13.320 align:start position:0%
while it is already revising the
 
05:45:15.468 --> 05:45:15.478 align:start position:0%
relevant regulations to create a
 
05:45:17.910 --> 05:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
preliminary application Phase so that
 
05:45:20.190 --> 05:45:20.200 align:start position:0%
applications that are clearly illc
 
05:45:22.670 --> 05:45:22.680 align:start position:0%
conceived can be rejected based upon the
 
05:45:25.350 --> 05:45:25.360 align:start position:0%
evidence contained in a partial permit
 
05:45:27.868 --> 05:45:27.878 align:start position:0%
application also those applications that
 
05:45:29.548 --> 05:45:29.558 align:start position:0%
are that are based basically deemed
 
05:45:31.830 --> 05:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
plausible can then proceed to a full
 
05:45:34.468 --> 05:45:34.478 align:start position:0%
application which can be processed more
 
05:45:37.230 --> 05:45:37.240 align:start position:0%
quickly than a single-phase application
 
05:45:40.548 --> 05:45:40.558 align:start position:0%
since Dees will already have evaluated
 
05:45:43.468 --> 05:45:43.478 align:start position:0%
the basic parameters of the location
 
05:45:46.750 --> 05:45:46.760 align:start position:0%
proposed so rather than the old bill
 
05:45:50.310 --> 05:45:50.320 align:start position:0%
which was you know 602 from last session
 
05:45:51.990 --> 05:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
rather than that which was actually
 
05:45:54.990 --> 05:45:55.000 align:start position:0%
writing you know statute or criteria
 
05:45:58.350 --> 05:45:58.360 align:start position:0%
into the statute for Dees this is just
 
05:46:01.270 --> 05:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
basically a preliminary application that
 
05:46:03.750 --> 05:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
the legislature here can merely direct
 
05:46:06.150 --> 05:46:06.160 align:start position:0%
which Dees is asking us to do all of the
 
05:46:08.750 --> 05:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
time to develop such criteria on their
 
05:46:10.830 --> 05:46:10.840 align:start position:0%
own which they are currently in the
 
05:46:13.030 --> 05:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
process of doing based upon their own
 
05:46:15.070 --> 05:46:15.080 align:start position:0%
judgment and comments from experts in
 
05:46:19.070 --> 05:46:19.080 align:start position:0%
the public please approve this thank
 
05:46:25.350 --> 05:46:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:27.788 --> 05:46:27.798 align:start position:0%
verville thank you Mr

05:46:35.390 --> 05:46:35.400 align:start position:0%
Amendment what's it
 
05:46:39.868 --> 05:46:39.878 align:start position:0%
fix so previous Bill said that we're
 
05:46:42.510 --> 05:46:42.520 align:start position:0%
going to get a third party involved with
 
05:46:45.788 --> 05:46:45.798 align:start position:0%
Dees for writing the new rules DS is
 
05:46:48.310 --> 05:46:48.320 align:start position:0%
writing new landfill sighting rules I
 
05:46:50.270 --> 05:46:50.280 align:start position:0%
don't know if you guys knew that they're
 
05:46:52.990 --> 05:46:53.000 align:start position:0%
due to be complete this
 
05:46:56.590 --> 05:46:56.600 align:start position:0%
summer thees expects to be finished with
 
05:47:02.270 --> 05:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
their landfill rule writing this summer
 
05:47:04.310 --> 05:47:04.320 align:start position:0%
and so the bill wants to get a third
 
05:47:06.830 --> 05:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
party as of yet unnamed unknown so maybe
 
05:47:08.868 --> 05:47:08.878 align:start position:0%
Pro business Maybe not maybe pro-
 
05:47:10.548 --> 05:47:10.558 align:start position:0%
environment maybe not who knows you got
 
05:47:12.070 --> 05:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
to wait to to find out you have to pass
 
05:47:13.510 --> 05:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
the bill to find out who's going to get
 
05:47:13.520 --> 05:47:16.310 align:start position:0%
the bill to find out who's going to get
the

05:47:16.310 --> 05:47:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:16.320 --> 05:47:18.270 align:start position:0%
 
contract

05:47:18.270 --> 05:47:18.280 align:start position:0%
contract
 
05:47:21.468 --> 05:47:21.478 align:start position:0%
so the floor Amendment says well the
 
05:47:24.590 --> 05:47:24.600 align:start position:0%
current rules will stay in effect if
 
05:47:26.230 --> 05:47:26.240 align:start position:0%
they don't get the new rules done in
 
05:47:27.948 --> 05:47:27.958 align:start position:0%
time because we're bringing this third
 
05:47:30.670 --> 05:47:30.680 align:start position:0%
party in which could delay it by a year
 
05:47:30.680 --> 05:47:31.788 align:start position:0%
party in which could delay it by a year
or

05:47:31.788 --> 05:47:31.798 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:47:34.990 --> 05:47:35.000 align:start position:0%
two but what I hear on on both sides is
 
05:47:38.110 --> 05:47:38.120 align:start position:0%
nobody seems to like the current rules
 
05:47:40.230 --> 05:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
so if we pass this bill we're going to
 
05:47:42.150 --> 05:47:42.160 align:start position:0%
enshrine the current rules which nobody
 
05:47:46.590 --> 05:47:46.600 align:start position:0%
seems to like um until such a time as as
 
05:47:48.990 --> 05:47:49.000 align:start position:0%
new rules get written by Dees with the
 
05:47:51.708 --> 05:47:51.718 align:start position:0%
help of an unknown third
 
05:47:54.548 --> 05:47:54.558 align:start position:0%
party one of my favorite refrains in
 
05:48:00.230 --> 05:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
this in this body is trust our experts
 
05:48:01.510 --> 05:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
trust our
 
05:48:04.468 --> 05:48:04.478 align:start position:0%
experts we hire the state of New
 
05:48:08.510 --> 05:48:08.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hire some of the best and the
 
05:48:13.788 --> 05:48:13.798 align:start position:0%
brightest to do our work the work of the
 
05:48:18.708 --> 05:48:18.718 align:start position:0%
state and we've entrusted them for
 
05:48:20.948 --> 05:48:20.958 align:start position:0%
decades when I say them I'm talking
 
05:48:24.270 --> 05:48:24.280 align:start position:0%
right now about Dees in writing landfill
 
05:48:26.110 --> 05:48:26.120 align:start position:0%
citing rules and
 
05:48:30.110 --> 05:48:30.120 align:start position:0%
regulations but now all of a of a sudden
 
05:48:31.390 --> 05:48:31.400 align:start position:0%
when they're going to be done this
 
05:48:34.948 --> 05:48:34.958 align:start position:0%
summer we don't trust them we want to
 
05:48:37.310 --> 05:48:37.320 align:start position:0%
get a third party involved to give some
 
05:48:39.310 --> 05:48:39.320 align:start position:0%
sort of advice that we don't really know
 
05:48:41.070 --> 05:48:41.080 align:start position:0%
what it's going to
 
05:48:45.670 --> 05:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
be how do you know the rules that de's
 
05:48:48.270 --> 05:48:48.280 align:start position:0%
writing are
 
05:48:51.350 --> 05:48:51.360 align:start position:0%
broken if they haven't been published
 
05:48:55.788 --> 05:48:55.798 align:start position:0%
yet so this bill is a fix for something
 
05:48:59.030 --> 05:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
that's being done that's not complete so
 
05:49:01.548 --> 05:49:01.558 align:start position:0%
we don't we don't know if there's a
 
05:49:04.868 --> 05:49:04.878 align:start position:0%
problem so what I'm really asking
 
05:49:07.670 --> 05:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
for is to kill this
 
05:49:11.990 --> 05:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
bill let Dees publish their new rules
 
05:49:15.150 --> 05:49:15.160 align:start position:0%
and regulations for landfill
 
05:49:19.190 --> 05:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
sighting and then and then if there's an
 
05:49:22.350 --> 05:49:22.360 align:start position:0%
issue come back and correct whatever
 
05:49:26.670 --> 05:49:26.680 align:start position:0%
issue we believe may or may not exist
 
05:49:27.990 --> 05:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm that's what I'm asking
 
05:49:30.430 --> 05:49:30.440 align:start position:0%
you to do
 
05:49:34.230 --> 05:49:34.240 align:start position:0%
a two-phase permitting
 
05:49:36.990 --> 05:49:37.000 align:start position:0%
process sounds like
 
05:49:41.310 --> 05:49:41.320 align:start position:0%
fun right bite once if you're lucky you
 
05:49:42.948 --> 05:49:42.958 align:start position:0%
get to
 
05:49:47.948 --> 05:49:47.958 align:start position:0%
swallow bite twice find out can drag on
 
05:49:50.468 --> 05:49:50.478 align:start position:0%
for forever can drag on forever the
 
05:49:52.708 --> 05:49:52.718 align:start position:0%
current process well that's interesting
 
05:49:55.750 --> 05:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
because my understanding is that a solid
 
05:49:59.150 --> 05:49:59.160 align:start position:0%
waste um company the company that takes
 
05:50:02.548 --> 05:50:02.558 align:start position:0%
care of solid waste is put in a new
 
05:50:05.510 --> 05:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
permit for a location up north of which
 
05:50:07.230 --> 05:50:07.240 align:start position:0%
we've heard about before that's really
 
05:50:09.750 --> 05:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
what where this all comes from may or
 
05:50:12.270 --> 05:50:12.280 align:start position:0%
may not be up by
 
05:50:15.070 --> 05:50:15.080 align:start position:0%
Dalton and
 
05:50:18.190 --> 05:50:18.200 align:start position:0%
Dees and this is just recently and DS
 
05:50:21.468 --> 05:50:21.478 align:start position:0%
has already told them we're sorry we're
 
05:50:23.310 --> 05:50:23.320 align:start position:0%
not really doing much with your permit
 
05:50:25.390 --> 05:50:25.400 align:start position:0%
because it's incomplete so in a matter
 
05:50:27.430 --> 05:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
of weeks a couple of months at
 
05:50:30.750 --> 05:50:30.760 align:start position:0%
most DS has already said your your
 
05:50:33.310 --> 05:50:33.320 align:start position:0%
application is incomplete that does not
 
05:50:36.390 --> 05:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
sound like dragging on for an inordinate
 
05:50:39.510 --> 05:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
amounts of time it seems to me that DS
 
05:50:40.868 --> 05:50:40.878 align:start position:0%
is getting
 
05:50:44.110 --> 05:50:44.120 align:start position:0%
applications working very efficiently
 
05:50:46.910 --> 05:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
very effectively and getting back with
 
05:50:49.548 --> 05:50:49.558 align:start position:0%
with the correct information um for all
 
05:50:51.230 --> 05:50:51.240 align:start position:0%
parties in
 
05:50:53.788 --> 05:50:53.798 align:start position:0%
involved I've I've seen a lot of emails
 
05:50:55.990 --> 05:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
flying back back and forth about this
 
05:50:59.030 --> 05:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
particular application and DEA s is
 
05:51:01.750 --> 05:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
responding to parties on both sides of
 
05:51:05.548 --> 05:51:05.558 align:start position:0%
this issue in an unbelievably timely
 
05:51:08.150 --> 05:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
manner when we consider it state
 
05:51:10.190 --> 05:51:10.200 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy right because bureaucracy
 
05:51:13.670 --> 05:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
drags on well DS is not dragging their
 
05:51:16.468 --> 05:51:16.478 align:start position:0%
feet so so I'm not
 
05:51:19.230 --> 05:51:19.240 align:start position:0%
sure I'm not sure I agree with with any
 
05:51:19.240 --> 05:51:22.430 align:start position:0%
sure I'm not sure I agree with with any
of

05:51:22.430 --> 05:51:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:25.230 --> 05:51:25.240 align:start position:0%
that I'm on environment and agriculture
 
05:51:27.270 --> 05:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
committee and you're going to see a lot
 
05:51:31.230 --> 05:51:31.240 align:start position:0%
more bills like this Us in the next 6
 
05:51:35.548 --> 05:51:35.558 align:start position:0%
months trivia question for you hasm
 
05:51:38.110 --> 05:51:38.120 align:start position:0%
generated within the state of New
 
05:51:40.948 --> 05:51:40.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where does it
 
05:51:43.708 --> 05:51:43.718 align:start position:0%
go it goes out of state do you know why
 
05:51:45.628 --> 05:51:45.638 align:start position:0%
do you know why it goes out of state
 
05:51:48.548 --> 05:51:48.558 align:start position:0%
because New Hampshire does not have a
 
05:51:51.788 --> 05:51:51.798 align:start position:0%
Hazmat remediation facility within our
 
05:51:51.798 --> 05:51:52.750 align:start position:0%
Hazmat remediation facility within our
state

05:51:52.750 --> 05:51:52.760 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:51:55.868 --> 05:51:55.878 align:start position:0%
boundaries and people are complaining
 
05:51:57.708 --> 05:51:57.718 align:start position:0%
about the sighting of landfills in New
 
05:51:59.390 --> 05:51:59.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and one the big complaints is
 
05:52:01.270 --> 05:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to be importing trash well
 
05:52:03.910 --> 05:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
we already import trash we export trash
 
05:52:07.350 --> 05:52:07.360 align:start position:0%
trash goes both ways right Commerce
 
05:52:09.390 --> 05:52:09.400 align:start position:0%
Clause allows
 
05:52:12.788 --> 05:52:12.798 align:start position:0%
that so imagine if if New Hampshire put
 
05:52:15.868 --> 05:52:15.878 align:start position:0%
a ban on the importation of
 
05:52:19.948 --> 05:52:19.958 align:start position:0%
trash and other states did the same and
 
05:52:22.350 --> 05:52:22.360 align:start position:0%
we start passing bills that make it
 
05:52:24.628 --> 05:52:24.638 align:start position:0%
impossible to site a landfill in New
 
05:52:27.310 --> 05:52:27.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because in my opinion that's
 
05:52:28.830 --> 05:52:28.840 align:start position:0%
the endgame of this this type of
 
05:52:31.230 --> 05:52:31.240 align:start position:0%
legislation is to make it so that we
 
05:52:33.670 --> 05:52:33.680 align:start position:0%
cannot site landfills within New
 
05:52:35.990 --> 05:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that means we would have to
 
05:52:39.468 --> 05:52:39.478 align:start position:0%
export all of our trash so first we're
 
05:52:41.430 --> 05:52:41.440 align:start position:0%
complaining that we're importing trash
 
05:52:42.948 --> 05:52:42.958 align:start position:0%
but then we want to write rules
 
05:52:45.910 --> 05:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
regulations and state law that will
 
05:52:48.190 --> 05:52:48.200 align:start position:0%
eventually Force us to have to export
 
05:52:51.390 --> 05:52:51.400 align:start position:0%
all of our trash that's not
 
05:52:55.230 --> 05:52:55.240 align:start position:0%
fair that's not Equitable that is not
 
05:52:57.150 --> 05:52:57.160 align:start position:0%
good public
 
05:52:57.160 --> 05:52:59.788 align:start position:0%
good public
policy

05:52:59.788 --> 05:52:59.798 align:start position:0%
policy
 
05:53:03.110 --> 05:53:03.120 align:start position:0%
this is a difficult topic it really is
 
05:53:06.270 --> 05:53:06.280 align:start position:0%
and the state of New Hampshire is not
 
05:53:08.350 --> 05:53:08.360 align:start position:0%
perfect at this time I don't I don't
 
05:53:10.190 --> 05:53:10.200 align:start position:0%
disagree with that at
 
05:53:14.548 --> 05:53:14.558 align:start position:0%
all this fix is not the right fix it's
 
05:53:16.788 --> 05:53:16.798 align:start position:0%
not the right fix at the right
 
05:53:23.868 --> 05:53:23.878 align:start position:0%
time let's trust our experts let's trust
 
05:53:27.150 --> 05:53:27.160 align:start position:0%
Dees to write the new rules and the new
 
05:53:30.350 --> 05:53:30.360 align:start position:0%
regulations let them bring it to jel car
 
05:53:34.310 --> 05:53:34.320 align:start position:0%
let the process play out let's see what
 
05:53:38.190 --> 05:53:38.200 align:start position:0%
our our experts propose for us to help
 
05:53:41.548 --> 05:53:41.558 align:start position:0%
us work through this and
 
05:53:44.868 --> 05:53:44.878 align:start position:0%
then and then if we don't like what they
 
05:53:48.390 --> 05:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
bring us then let us consider potential
 
05:53:48.400 --> 05:53:51.670 align:start position:0%
bring us then let us consider potential
corrective

05:53:51.670 --> 05:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:54.708 --> 05:53:54.718 align:start position:0%
actions right now the process is is on
 
05:53:56.788 --> 05:53:56.798 align:start position:0%
time and working out as planned and
 
05:53:59.070 --> 05:53:59.080 align:start position:0%
that's what we should do so for that
 
05:54:04.270 --> 05:54:04.280 align:start position:0%
reason I'm asking you um to to to vote
 
05:54:07.628 --> 05:54:07.638 align:start position:0%
against the uh the a to
 
05:54:10.990 --> 05:54:11.000 align:start position:0%
pass and uh so another another motion
 
05:54:13.948 --> 05:54:13.958 align:start position:0%
can be made thank you Mr Speaker chair
 
05:54:19.190 --> 05:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:22.628 --> 05:54:22.638 align:start position:0%
Gera thank you Mr Speaker wish my house

colleagues a happy New Year uh one of
 
05:54:27.190 --> 05:54:27.200 align:start position:0%
the I think the most common question I
 
05:54:29.548 --> 05:54:29.558 align:start position:0%
get from constit constituents uh back in
 
05:54:32.350 --> 05:54:32.360 align:start position:0%
Kean and Chester county is do we ever
 
05:54:34.270 --> 05:54:34.280 align:start position:0%
get anything done here on a bipartisan
 
05:54:36.510 --> 05:54:36.520 align:start position:0%
basis uh and I'm happy to tell them we
 
05:54:38.590 --> 05:54:38.600 align:start position:0%
do talk to them about the consent
 
05:54:40.390 --> 05:54:40.400 align:start position:0%
calendar I talk about all the good
 
05:54:42.670 --> 05:54:42.680 align:start position:0%
bipartisan work that we get done here uh
 
05:54:44.990 --> 05:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
in conquered I'm proud to say that my
 
05:54:46.830 --> 05:54:46.840 align:start position:0%
committee with leadership on both sides
 
05:54:48.510 --> 05:54:48.520 align:start position:0%
of the aisle is an especially bike
 
05:54:50.510 --> 05:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
partisan committee and we work hard to
 
05:54:52.750 --> 05:54:52.760 align:start position:0%
come together on legislation that we
 
05:54:54.548 --> 05:54:54.558 align:start position:0%
feel not only benefits the people of the
 
05:54:56.708 --> 05:54:56.718 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire but has a very
 
05:54:58.750 --> 05:54:58.760 align:start position:0%
realistic chance of getting bipartisan
 
05:55:01.468 --> 05:55:01.478 align:start position:0%
support from our colleagues in the house
 
05:55:04.708 --> 05:55:04.718 align:start position:0%
this piece of legislation is no
 
05:55:07.430 --> 05:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
different despite our many differences
 
05:55:10.230 --> 05:55:10.240 align:start position:0%
on a wide variety of topics this body in
 
05:55:13.150 --> 05:55:13.160 align:start position:0%
this chamber has been consistent in our
 
05:55:15.150 --> 05:55:15.160 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support when it comes to
 
05:55:17.270 --> 05:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
protecting the environment and public
 
05:55:20.150 --> 05:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
health when it comes to landfill
 
05:55:22.430 --> 05:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
sighting as I said this bill is a
 
05:55:24.708 --> 05:55:24.718 align:start position:0%
perfect example of the work that we have
 
05:55:28.070 --> 05:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
been striving to do together when we
 
05:55:29.548 --> 05:55:29.558 align:start position:0%
talk to the Department of Environmental
 
05:55:31.990 --> 05:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
Services about the kinds of legislation
 
05:55:33.628 --> 05:55:33.638 align:start position:0%
that will benefit them most in their
 
05:55:35.548 --> 05:55:35.558 align:start position:0%
efforts what they tell us is that they
 
05:55:38.150 --> 05:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
need a balance of clarity and
 
05:55:40.430 --> 05:55:40.440 align:start position:0%
flexibility they need to know what the
 
05:55:42.510 --> 05:55:42.520 align:start position:0%
direction is that the legislature is
 
05:55:44.548 --> 05:55:44.558 align:start position:0%
providing but they also need us to
 
05:55:46.990 --> 05:55:47.000 align:start position:0%
provide the flexibility that allows them
 
05:55:49.350 --> 05:55:49.360 align:start position:0%
to write the kinds of rules that will
 
05:55:52.628 --> 05:55:52.638 align:start position:0%
enact the will of the legislature that's
 
05:55:56.270 --> 05:55:56.280 align:start position:0%
exactly what 602 Does this does not tell
 
05:56:00.190 --> 05:56:00.200 align:start position:0%
Dees what they have to put as the
 
05:56:04.350 --> 05:56:04.360 align:start position:0%
Criterion in the first stage it doesn't
 
05:56:06.670 --> 05:56:06.680 align:start position:0%
tict dictate any range of policies any
 
05:56:09.430 --> 05:56:09.440 align:start position:0%
contented policies with due respect to
 
05:56:11.990 --> 05:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
my colleague I'm not really sure what
 
05:56:13.590 --> 05:56:13.600 align:start position:0%
bill it was that he was reading before
 
05:56:16.548 --> 05:56:16.558 align:start position:0%
he prepared his floor speech this bill
 
05:56:19.708 --> 05:56:19.718 align:start position:0%
does not refer to any third party it
 
05:56:22.670 --> 05:56:22.680 align:start position:0%
does not require Dees to go out and
 
05:56:24.468 --> 05:56:24.478 align:start position:0%
bring a third party in to come up with
 
05:56:26.390 --> 05:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
any list of requirements it's simply not
 
05:56:28.868 --> 05:56:28.878 align:start position:0%
in the bill what what the bill says is
 
05:56:28.878 --> 05:56:30.070 align:start position:0%
in the bill what what the bill says is
that

05:56:30.070 --> 05:56:30.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:56:33.430 --> 05:56:33.440 align:start position:0%
Dees will determine what the
 
05:56:36.948 --> 05:56:36.958 align:start position:0%
disqualifying conditions would be and if
 
05:56:39.788 --> 05:56:39.798 align:start position:0%
a an applicant submits an
 
05:56:42.070 --> 05:56:42.080 align:start position:0%
application and it doesn't meet those
 
05:56:43.948 --> 05:56:43.958 align:start position:0%
minimum requirements it simply gets
 
05:56:46.070 --> 05:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
returned without prejudice by the way
 
05:56:49.948 --> 05:56:49.958 align:start position:0%
this is a permitting application process
 
05:56:52.788 --> 05:56:52.798 align:start position:0%
that these businesses deal with in
 
05:56:54.430 --> 05:56:54.440 align:start position:0%
States all across the country they're
 
05:56:57.230 --> 05:56:57.240 align:start position:0%
perfectly familiar with it it doesn't
 
05:56:59.910 --> 05:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
dictate to Dees what those Criterion has
 
05:57:02.390 --> 05:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
to be it doesn't require a third party
 
05:57:06.548 --> 05:57:06.558 align:start position:0%
to come in and do any work to tell Dees
 
05:57:09.948 --> 05:57:09.958 align:start position:0%
how to do their jobs my colleague I
 
05:57:12.510 --> 05:57:12.520 align:start position:0%
think was absolutely right when he said
 
05:57:14.270 --> 05:57:14.280 align:start position:0%
that we should trust our experts and
 
05:57:17.548 --> 05:57:17.558 align:start position:0%
that is precisely what 602 is designed
 
05:57:17.558 --> 05:57:18.510 align:start position:0%
that is precisely what 602 is designed
to

05:57:18.510 --> 05:57:18.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:57:22.548 --> 05:57:22.558 align:start position:0%
do Dees is in the middle of rewriting
 
05:57:25.190 --> 05:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
those rules I'm confident that they're
 
05:57:27.350 --> 05:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
going to come up with a set of rules
 
05:57:30.070 --> 05:57:30.080 align:start position:0%
that will will provide the type of
 
05:57:31.868 --> 05:57:31.878 align:start position:0%
protections that we all want for our
 
05:57:34.110 --> 05:57:34.120 align:start position:0%
constituents here in the granite
 
05:57:37.670 --> 05:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
state the Draft rules as they are out
 
05:57:40.070 --> 05:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
now for public review contain a very
 
05:57:42.230 --> 05:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
strong statement already it says that
 
05:57:44.310 --> 05:57:44.320 align:start position:0%
the footprint of a landfill and
 
05:57:46.788 --> 05:57:46.798 align:start position:0%
Associated infrastructure shall be
 
05:57:49.708 --> 05:57:49.718 align:start position:0%
located such that a discharge spill
 
05:57:52.310 --> 05:57:52.320 align:start position:0%
leachate release or other failure of the
 
05:57:54.830 --> 05:57:54.840 align:start position:0%
waste containment system or Associated
 
05:57:57.830 --> 05:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
infrastructure I know sexy stuff will be
 
05:58:00.030 --> 05:58:00.040 align:start position:0%
detected and assessed and Remediation
 
05:58:03.070 --> 05:58:03.080 align:start position:0%
initiated prior to contamination
 
05:58:06.708 --> 05:58:06.718 align:start position:0%
reaching any perennial water body that's
 
05:58:07.990 --> 05:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
part of the rules that they're working
 
05:58:09.750 --> 05:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
on right now that's a strong statement I
 
05:58:11.150 --> 05:58:11.160 align:start position:0%
think that's a statement that we can all
 
05:58:13.788 --> 05:58:13.798 align:start position:0%
get behind and we are simply asking for
 
05:58:16.350 --> 05:58:16.360 align:start position:0%
at a first stage in this process that
 
05:58:20.708 --> 05:58:20.718 align:start position:0%
will quantify what that means to give
 
05:58:22.788 --> 05:58:22.798 align:start position:0%
direction to all of the applicants to
 
05:58:25.390 --> 05:58:25.400 align:start position:0%
know this is what we're looking for that
 
05:58:28.350 --> 05:58:28.360 align:start position:0%
Dees doesn't need to use unne necessary
 
05:58:31.310 --> 05:58:31.320 align:start position:0%
time and neither does the applicant in
 
05:58:34.510 --> 05:58:34.520 align:start position:0%
order to enter their permit to be
 
05:58:36.430 --> 05:58:36.440 align:start position:0%
successful and to provide the
 
05:58:39.468 --> 05:58:39.478 align:start position:0%
protections that we all want uh and need
 
05:58:43.270 --> 05:58:43.280 align:start position:0%
for our constituents so I ask you all as
 
05:58:45.628 --> 05:58:45.638 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr
 
06:00:28.110 --> 06:00:28.120 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr Speaker if I know
 
06:00:30.910 --> 06:00:30.920 align:start position:0%
that Dees is already kneed deep in
 
06:00:32.990 --> 06:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
writing the rules and would like the
 
06:00:35.590 --> 06:00:35.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to complete them before more
 
06:00:38.788 --> 06:00:38.798 align:start position:0%
legislation is thrown at them and if I
 
06:00:39.990 --> 06:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
know that their rules are to be
 
06:00:42.510 --> 06:00:42.520 align:start position:0%
completed in August of
 
06:00:46.510 --> 06:00:46.520 align:start position:0%
2024 just a mere 7 months from now and
 
06:00:48.070 --> 06:00:48.080 align:start position:0%
that we can help with the direction of
 
06:00:49.548 --> 06:00:49.558 align:start position:0%
the rules by attending the public
 
06:00:51.230 --> 06:00:51.240 align:start position:0%
hearings and being involved as
 
06:00:53.468 --> 06:00:53.478 align:start position:0%
legislators and
 
06:00:56.708 --> 06:00:56.718 align:start position:0%
citizens and finally Mr Speaker if I
 
06:00:58.590 --> 06:00:58.600 align:start position:0%
know that we need to let the process
 
06:01:01.230 --> 06:01:01.240 align:start position:0%
play out before we try to legislate what
 
06:01:03.110 --> 06:01:03.120 align:start position:0%
should and shouldn't be in the rules
 
06:01:05.910 --> 06:01:05.920 align:start position:0%

nothing to do with third party
 
06:01:20.510 --> 06:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
Consultants Mr Speaker if I know that HB
 
06:01:23.230 --> 06:01:23.240 align:start position:0%
602 also has absolutely nothing to do
 
06:01:26.270 --> 06:01:26.280 align:start position:0%
with um landfill citing criteria it
 
06:01:28.190 --> 06:01:28.200 align:start position:0%
merely um require requires the
 
06:01:29.868 --> 06:01:29.878 align:start position:0%
implementation of a preliminary
 
06:01:31.868 --> 06:01:31.878 align:start position:0%
preliminary phase of the application
 
06:01:33.990 --> 06:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
process and Mr Speaker if I know that
 
06:01:35.670 --> 06:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
the two-phase landfill application
 
06:01:37.628 --> 06:01:37.638 align:start position:0%
permitting process has been a standard
 
06:01:39.948 --> 06:01:39.958 align:start position:0%
procedure across the country for decades
 
06:01:41.830 --> 06:01:41.840 align:start position:0%
and furthermore Mr Speaker if I know
 
06:01:44.110 --> 06:01:44.120 align:start position:0%
that implementing um a two-phase
 
06:01:46.548 --> 06:01:46.558 align:start position:0%
application process can streamline this
 
06:01:48.670 --> 06:01:48.680 align:start position:0%
process saving time and money not only
 
06:01:50.868 --> 06:01:50.878 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker I

Rise this
 
06:05:04.750 --> 06:05:04.760 align:start position:0%
afternoon to speak against the

06:05:13.150 --> 06:05:13.160 align:start position:0%
559 what this what this amendment does
 
06:05:15.670 --> 06:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
it's a rewrite right so we're going to
 
06:05:18.270 --> 06:05:18.280 align:start position:0%
be looking at this amendment
 
06:05:21.548 --> 06:05:21.558 align:start position:0%
versus the bill itself this legislation
 
06:05:26.070 --> 06:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
creates a third pension
 
06:05:26.080 --> 06:05:28.350 align:start position:0%
creates a third pension
system

06:05:28.350 --> 06:05:28.360 align:start position:0%
system
 
06:05:31.590 --> 06:05:31.600 align:start position:0%
this concept does not promote people
 
06:05:34.830 --> 06:05:34.840 align:start position:0%
having careers with the state but simp
 
06:05:37.590 --> 06:05:37.600 align:start position:0%
simply turns them into a job this will
 
06:05:40.910 --> 06:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
lead to higher turnover rates has as has
 
06:05:42.830 --> 06:05:42.840 align:start position:0%
happened in the state of
 
06:05:45.948 --> 06:05:45.958 align:start position:0%
Alaska leading to constant and expensive
 
06:05:48.350 --> 06:05:48.360 align:start position:0%
costs to train new
 
06:05:51.628 --> 06:05:51.638 align:start position:0%
people doing the work of the state is
 
06:05:54.190 --> 06:05:54.200 align:start position:0%
not a job hopping
 
06:05:57.230 --> 06:05:57.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity under this provision an
 
06:05:59.310 --> 06:05:59.320 align:start position:0%
employee who leaves State
 
06:06:01.430 --> 06:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
Employment can choose to leave their
 
06:06:04.510 --> 06:06:04.520 align:start position:0%
money in the plan so the system will
 
06:06:07.310 --> 06:06:07.320 align:start position:0%
have to manage a plan for someone who
 
06:06:09.910 --> 06:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
does not even work for the state anymore
 
06:06:11.750 --> 06:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
this can be an employee who only worked
 
06:06:14.830 --> 06:06:14.840 align:start position:0%
for the state for one
 
06:06:17.270 --> 06:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
year the New Hampshire retirement system
 
06:06:20.110 --> 06:06:20.120 align:start position:0%
stated they don't want to manage this
 
06:06:22.110 --> 06:06:22.120 align:start position:0%
the original fiscal
 
06:06:25.868 --> 06:06:25.878 align:start position:0%
note on this bill did not even calculate
 
06:06:27.628 --> 06:06:27.638 align:start position:0%
the operational
 
06:06:31.830 --> 06:06:31.840 align:start position:0%
costs associated with this type of
 
06:06:34.830 --> 06:06:34.840 align:start position:0%
plan and opens up its management
 
06:06:38.670 --> 06:06:38.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:41.310 --> 06:06:41.320 align:start position:0%
party nor did it calculate how many
 
06:06:47.310 --> 06:06:47.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:49.310 --> 06:06:49.320 align:start position:0%
hire this
 
06:06:52.390 --> 06:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
amendment has no fiscal note attached to
 
06:06:55.110 --> 06:06:55.120 align:start position:0%
it or
 
06:06:57.830 --> 06:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
analysis the original bill
 
06:07:01.868 --> 06:07:01.878 align:start position:0%
had a $53 million impact beginning in
 
06:07:04.628 --> 06:07:04.638 align:start position:0%
2026 and that is the cheapest year
 
06:07:08.230 --> 06:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
annually moving forward this amendment
 
06:07:09.788 --> 06:07:09.798 align:start position:0%
which makes
 
06:07:12.548 --> 06:07:12.558 align:start position:0%
changes does not have a fiscal analysis
 
06:07:15.070 --> 06:07:15.080 align:start position:0%
as to what those changes will do the the
 
06:07:17.390 --> 06:07:17.400 align:start position:0%
the member will suspend it's getting
 
06:07:19.468 --> 06:07:19.478 align:start position:0%
awful noisy in here the member has a
 
06:07:22.430 --> 06:07:22.440 align:start position:0%
right to be heard if you need to have a
 
06:07:25.230 --> 06:07:25.240 align:start position:0%
conversation take it out into the Annie
 
06:07:27.350 --> 06:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
room remember I'm making continue thank
 
06:07:29.750 --> 06:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
you Mr Speaker what this amendment will
 
06:07:32.830 --> 06:07:32.840 align:start position:0%
do is it will require
 
06:07:36.670 --> 06:07:36.680 align:start position:0%
employers I.E the state I.E the
 
06:07:40.830 --> 06:07:40.840 align:start position:0%
taxpayer to pay into group three and
 
06:07:43.550 --> 06:07:43.560 align:start position:0%
group one for the same
 
06:07:43.560 --> 06:07:44.750 align:start position:0%
group one for the same

employee

06:07:46.430 --> 06:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
employee
 
06:07:49.310 --> 06:07:49.320 align:start position:0%
so the taxpayer has to pay into two
 
06:07:52.750 --> 06:07:52.760 align:start position:0%
different pension systems for one
 
06:07:55.990 --> 06:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
person this is because this provision
 
06:07:57.590 --> 06:07:57.600 align:start position:0%
does not low
 
06:08:00.070 --> 06:08:00.080 align:start position:0%
the pension debt that we are currently
 
06:08:00.080 --> 06:08:04.030 align:start position:0%
the pension debt that we are currently
working

06:08:04.030 --> 06:08:04.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:06.430 --> 06:08:06.440 align:start position:0%
through the Bill's methodology the
 
06:08:08.230 --> 06:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
original Bill's methodology says the
 
06:08:10.750 --> 06:08:10.760 align:start position:0%
costs will continue to increase
 
06:08:14.110 --> 06:08:14.120 align:start position:0%
accordingly as more new hires are
 
06:08:19.868 --> 06:08:19.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:22.510 --> 06:08:22.520 align:start position:0%
plan now New Hampshire is not Paving the
 
06:08:24.750 --> 06:08:24.760 align:start position:0%
road on this
 
06:08:27.230 --> 06:08:27.240 align:start position:0%
concept we can thank the state of Alaska
 
06:08:30.150 --> 06:08:30.160 align:start position:0%
for this this was implemented in Alaska
 
06:08:30.160 --> 06:08:31.310 align:start position:0%
for this this was implemented in Alaska
in

06:08:31.310 --> 06:08:31.320 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:08:33.628 --> 06:08:33.638 align:start position:0%
2006 and it has been an absolute
 
06:08:35.948 --> 06:08:35.958 align:start position:0%
disaster for
 
06:08:38.708 --> 06:08:38.718 align:start position:0%
Alaska so much so that half of the
 
06:08:40.788 --> 06:08:40.798 align:start position:0%
members of Alaska's Senate have
 
06:08:42.910 --> 06:08:42.920 align:start position:0%
announced their support for legislation
 
06:08:46.230 --> 06:08:46.240 align:start position:0%
that would reinstate their pension
 
06:08:48.628 --> 06:08:48.638 align:start position:0%
system unlike New Hampshire where bills
 
06:08:50.750 --> 06:08:50.760 align:start position:0%
have a a single Prime sponsor Alaska
 
06:08:53.750 --> 06:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
allows three prime sponsors all three of
 
06:08:55.708 --> 06:08:55.718 align:start position:0%
those are
 
06:08:55.718 --> 06:08:59.150 align:start position:0%
those are
Republicans

06:08:59.150 --> 06:08:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:01.070 --> 06:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
so I rise today in
 
06:09:03.670 --> 06:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
opposition to the creation of a third
 
06:09:03.680 --> 06:09:04.910 align:start position:0%
opposition to the creation of a third
pension

06:09:04.910 --> 06:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
pension
 
06:09:09.750 --> 06:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
system that does not reduce the current
 
06:09:11.670 --> 06:09:11.680 align:start position:0%
debt that we are working towards and
 
06:09:14.628 --> 06:09:14.638 align:start position:0%
successfully working towards
 
06:09:19.150 --> 06:09:19.160 align:start position:0%
eliminating I rise in opposition to
 
06:09:23.548 --> 06:09:23.558 align:start position:0%
this because the agency that handles our
 
06:09:26.430 --> 06:09:26.440 align:start position:0%
pension system doesn't want to deal with
 
06:09:26.440 --> 06:09:28.788 align:start position:0%
pension system doesn't want to deal with
it

06:09:28.788 --> 06:09:28.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:32.270 --> 06:09:32.280 align:start position:0%
and I rise in opposition to this because
 
06:09:35.830 --> 06:09:35.840 align:start position:0%
this is the beginning of a road that we
 
06:09:38.670 --> 06:09:38.680 align:start position:0%
cannot afford to go
 
06:09:43.350 --> 06:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
down I appreciate your time thank you Mr
 
06:09:48.868 --> 06:09:48.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:52.110 --> 06:09:52.120 align:start position:0%
Simon thank you Mr Speaker uh Mr Speaker
 
06:09:54.190 --> 06:09:54.200 align:start position:0%
this uh conversation is on the amendment
 
06:09:55.948 --> 06:09:55.958 align:start position:0%
to the bill and with uh due respect to
 
06:09:58.590 --> 06:09:58.600 align:start position:0%
my colleague and my friend um I think
 
06:10:00.510 --> 06:10:00.520 align:start position:0%
he's confused as to the content of the
 
06:10:02.270 --> 06:10:02.280 align:start position:0%
amendment as opposed to the content of
 
06:10:05.070 --> 06:10:05.080 align:start position:0%
the original Bill uh this amendment uh
 
06:10:07.310 --> 06:10:07.320 align:start position:0%
actually addresses a few of his concerns
 
06:10:10.030 --> 06:10:10.040 align:start position:0%
first um if you look at if you're so
 
06:10:12.390 --> 06:10:12.400 align:start position:0%
inclined page 88 of this calendar
 
06:10:14.430 --> 06:10:14.440 align:start position:0%
looking at the first line the amendment
 
06:10:16.868 --> 06:10:16.878 align:start position:0%
pulls uh group one uh group three this
 
06:10:18.788 --> 06:10:18.798 align:start position:0%
new group um out of the New Hampshire
 
06:10:20.670 --> 06:10:20.680 align:start position:0%
retirement system and puts it under the
 
06:10:23.350 --> 06:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
offices of the administrator of the plan
 
06:10:26.150 --> 06:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
for the Deferred Compensation Plan um
 
06:10:27.548 --> 06:10:27.558 align:start position:0%
with the assist assistance of the
 
06:10:30.070 --> 06:10:30.080 align:start position:0%
services of the administrative Services
 
06:10:32.628 --> 06:10:32.638 align:start position:0%
um so it's no longer in the New
 
06:10:34.590 --> 06:10:34.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirement system if this
 
06:10:36.110 --> 06:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
passes it's now moved over to this other
 
06:10:38.150 --> 06:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
group and the administrator has told us
 
06:10:40.270 --> 06:10:40.280 align:start position:0%
that uh he has no problem facilitating
 
06:10:43.270 --> 06:10:43.280 align:start position:0%
this it's not a big deal whatsoever the
 
06:10:44.628 --> 06:10:44.638 align:start position:0%
other thing that this amendment does is
 
06:10:47.070 --> 06:10:47.080 align:start position:0%
it just raises the um percent of
 
06:10:49.270 --> 06:10:49.280 align:start position:0%
earnable compensation uh that the
 
06:10:50.910 --> 06:10:50.920 align:start position:0%
employer is going to be given towards
 
06:10:52.510 --> 06:10:52.520 align:start position:0%
the employee it makes it a bit of a a
 
06:10:55.070 --> 06:10:55.080 align:start position:0%
richer deal for the employee um to make
 
06:10:57.230 --> 06:10:57.240 align:start position:0%
it a little bit more
 
06:11:01.788 --> 06:11:01.798 align:start position:0%
ractive um as as a plan um as far as
 
06:11:04.270 --> 06:11:04.280 align:start position:0%
making deposits into two separate plans
 
06:11:05.468 --> 06:11:05.478 align:start position:0%
well yes because we still have the
 
06:11:07.510 --> 06:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability the money that would
 
06:11:11.430 --> 06:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
always be going towards the undefined uh
 
06:11:14.948 --> 06:11:14.958 align:start position:0%
un thank you um we'll still go to that
 
06:11:18.310 --> 06:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
to pay down the liability and the actual
 
06:11:20.430 --> 06:11:20.440 align:start position:0%
um money that the employee and the
 
06:11:21.750 --> 06:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
employer are putting and will go into
 
06:11:24.628 --> 06:11:24.638 align:start position:0%
the new uh group three retirement plan
 
06:11:27.110 --> 06:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
in order to ACU accumulate that
 
06:11:29.150 --> 06:11:29.160 align:start position:0%
um benefit for them in the future so
 
06:11:31.868 --> 06:11:31.878 align:start position:0%
we're not neglecting the um acur
 
06:11:34.270 --> 06:11:34.280 align:start position:0%
liability that still has to be paid down
 
06:11:35.628 --> 06:11:35.638 align:start position:0%
they're still paying towards that even
 
06:11:37.390 --> 06:11:37.400 align:start position:0%
with this new group three and finally
 
06:11:38.750 --> 06:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
the last thing that I would address that
 
06:11:41.430 --> 06:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
my colleague said um is that this would
 
06:11:43.628 --> 06:11:43.638 align:start position:0%
hurt retention uh the whole reason for
 
06:11:45.830 --> 06:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
bringing it Forward uh is because
 
06:11:47.628 --> 06:11:47.638 align:start position:0%
retention in with this particular group
 
06:11:51.350 --> 06:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
of employees is already non-existent um
 
06:11:53.150 --> 06:11:53.160 align:start position:0%
almost like a vast majority of them
 
06:11:54.830 --> 06:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
don't reach vestment which means that
 
06:11:56.628 --> 06:11:56.638 align:start position:0%
they'll pay into the present pension
 
06:11:58.628 --> 06:11:58.638 align:start position:0%
system and they'll never see a benefit
 
06:12:02.510 --> 06:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
for it so at least with this plan um

from day one their contributions the
 
06:12:06.590 --> 06:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
employer contributions go to the
 
06:12:08.070 --> 06:12:08.080 align:start position:0%
employee so from day one they have
 
06:12:11.590 --> 06:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
access to those um so they're already
 
06:12:13.310 --> 06:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
treating it like a job and not as a
 
06:12:15.150 --> 06:12:15.160 align:start position:0%
career um that's half of the reason why
 
06:12:16.948 --> 06:12:16.958 align:start position:0%
the bill was brought forward so just
 
06:12:18.948 --> 06:12:18.958 align:start position:0%
wanted to kind of address some of um his
 
06:12:21.548 --> 06:12:21.558 align:start position:0%
concerns and maybe your concerns and say
 
06:12:22.948 --> 06:12:22.958 align:start position:0%
uh whether or not you plan on voting for
 
06:12:24.430 --> 06:12:24.440 align:start position:0%
the overall bill this amendment
 
06:12:26.548 --> 06:12:26.558 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
06:15:15.990 --> 06:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
that the current retirement system is
 
06:15:19.230 --> 06:15:19.240 align:start position:0%
not satisfactory to the group one state
 
06:15:22.230 --> 06:15:22.240 align:start position:0%
employees since a very large percentage
 
06:15:25.070 --> 06:15:25.080 align:start position:0%
of them do not serve long enough to get
 
06:15:27.310 --> 06:15:27.320 align:start position:0%
any benefit from it
 
06:15:29.830 --> 06:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
and if I know that this is
 
06:15:34.430 --> 06:15:34.440 align:start position:0%
more comparable to Retirement Systems in
 
06:15:37.270 --> 06:15:37.280 align:start position:0%
the private sector to which the group
 
06:15:40.270 --> 06:15:40.280 align:start position:0%
one state employees frequently go to or

come back
 
06:15:44.468 --> 06:15:44.478 align:start position:0%

06:15:47.628 --> 06:15:47.638 align:start position:0%
fixed the administrative issues that had
 
06:15:50.150 --> 06:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
been pointed out at the public hearing
 
06:15:52.590 --> 06:15:52.600 align:start position:0%
and there were some this is a much
 
06:15:54.510 --> 06:15:54.520 align:start position:0%
cheaper plan to
 
06:15:57.270 --> 06:15:57.280 align:start position:0%
administer and if I know that this
 
06:16:00.190 --> 06:16:00.200 align:start position:0%
offers options to our employees that
 
06:16:02.948 --> 06:16:02.958 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
06:19:21.628 --> 06:19:21.638 align:start position:0%
that this legislation does not
 
06:19:24.670 --> 06:19:24.680 align:start position:0%
reduce the current pension debt by one
 
06:19:28.310 --> 06:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
penny and and if I know that adding a
 
06:19:31.390 --> 06:19:31.400 align:start position:0%
third pension system to a system that we
 
06:19:33.788 --> 06:19:33.798 align:start position:0%
have right now that has a plan to be
 
06:19:35.468 --> 06:19:35.478 align:start position:0%
repaired and is
 
06:19:37.868 --> 06:19:37.878 align:start position:0%
successful is not a great
 
06:19:41.510 --> 06:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
idea and if I know that turning State

careers into simple job hopping
 
06:19:45.628 --> 06:19:45.638 align:start position:0%

the 15 years I've been in the
 
06:20:10.390 --> 06:20:10.400 align:start position:0%

06:20:12.990 --> 06:20:13.000 align:start position:0%
tweaking and advis and changing our
 
06:20:15.788 --> 06:20:15.798 align:start position:0%

still

06:20:17.230 --> 06:20:17.240 align:start position:0%

postponement simply re keeps us from
 
06:20:36.190 --> 06:20:36.200 align:start position:0%
considering one possible change of the
 
06:20:38.868 --> 06:20:38.878 align:start position:0%
many possible issues that we have with
 
06:20:40.510 --> 06:20:40.520 align:start position:0%
the retirement
 
06:20:43.110 --> 06:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
system would I not consider it
 
06:20:46.670 --> 06:20:46.680 align:start position:0%
inappropriate to ban this one small
 
06:20:50.110 --> 06:20:50.120 align:start position:0%
piece instead of saying we will not

thank you Mr
 
06:29:03.510 --> 06:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that house bill
 
06:29:07.190 --> 06:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
436 as amended is the first significant
 
06:29:10.310 --> 06:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
spending bill before this house this
 
06:29:12.990 --> 06:29:13.000 align:start position:0%
year it will spend $50
 
06:29:16.150 --> 06:29:16.160 align:start position:0%
million to pay down the
 
06:29:19.670 --> 06:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
retirement fund unfunded liability and
 
06:29:22.350 --> 06:29:22.360 align:start position:0%
that's only a very small part of the
 
06:29:22.360 --> 06:29:23.590 align:start position:0%
that's only a very small part of the
unfunded

06:29:23.590 --> 06:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
unfunded
 
06:29:26.548 --> 06:29:26.558 align:start position:0%
liability and if I know there are many
 
06:29:29.390 --> 06:29:29.400 align:start position:0%
many more bills that will come before us
 
06:29:32.468 --> 06:29:32.478 align:start position:0%
in the coming months including a group
 
06:29:35.468 --> 06:29:35.478 align:start position:0%
two retirement bill which is the result
 
06:29:38.350 --> 06:29:38.360 align:start position:0%
of a bipartisan commission that will
 
06:29:41.750 --> 06:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
need tens of millions of dollarss and if
 
06:29:44.468 --> 06:29:44.478 align:start position:0%
I know that we will have a much better
 
06:29:48.070 --> 06:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
handle on our revenues and our ability
 
06:29:50.990 --> 06:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
to financially support spending when we
 
06:29:52.548 --> 06:29:52.558 align:start position:0%
get closer to
 
06:29:55.150 --> 06:29:55.160 align:start position:0%
crossover and if I know we need to be
 
06:29:58.270 --> 06:29:58.280 align:start position:0%
very careful and prioritize our spending
 
06:30:01.070 --> 06:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
in the second year of the banum and that
 
06:30:04.310 --> 06:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
laying House Bill 436 on the table at
 
06:30:07.390 --> 06:30:07.400 align:start position:0%
this time will still allow us to take
 
06:30:10.590 --> 06:30:10.600 align:start position:0%
the bill off the table before crossover
 
06:30:12.628 --> 06:30:12.638 align:start position:0%
when we will have a better Financial
 
06:30:15.030 --> 06:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
more better a better financial
 
06:30:17.548 --> 06:30:17.558 align:start position:0%
information allowing us to make a better
 
06:30:20.788 --> 06:30:20.798 align:start position:0%
informed decision would I now vote Yes
 
06:30:23.548 --> 06:30:23.558 align:start position:0%
to laying this bill on the
 
06:30:25.830 --> 06:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
table J I recognize representative
 
06:30:30.110 --> 06:30:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:32.628 --> 06:30:32.638 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr
 
06:30:36.510 --> 06:30:36.520 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know House Bill 436 is a
 
06:30:39.628 --> 06:30:39.638 align:start position:0%
duplicate of house bill 50 that passed
 
06:30:41.430 --> 06:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
the finance committee last year by a
 
06:30:44.310 --> 06:30:44.320 align:start position:0%
vote of 25 to Zer on March
 
06:30:46.590 --> 06:30:46.600 align:start position:0%
16th and I know that this bill will
 
06:30:48.350 --> 06:30:48.360 align:start position:0%
lower the contribution rates that our
 
06:30:50.070 --> 06:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities pay the New Hampshire
 
06:30:50.080 --> 06:30:51.548 align:start position:0%
municipalities pay the New Hampshire
retirement

06:30:51.548 --> 06:30:51.558 align:start position:0%
retirement
 
06:30:53.910 --> 06:30:53.920 align:start position:0%
system and that's one of the reasons the
 
06:30:55.830 --> 06:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
municipal assoc Association supports
 
06:30:55.840 --> 06:30:56.948 align:start position:0%
municipal assoc Association supports
this

06:30:56.948 --> 06:30:56.958 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:30:58.948 --> 06:30:58.958 align:start position:0%
legislation and if I know with the
 
06:31:02.388 --> 06:31:02.398 align:start position:0%
passage of House Bill 436 the retirement
 
06:31:03.868 --> 06:31:03.878 align:start position:0%
contribution rates that our
 
06:31:06.788 --> 06:31:06.798 align:start position:0%
municipalities pay will be lower which
 
06:31:09.388 --> 06:31:09.398 align:start position:0%
would actually be a tax cut to those
 
06:31:12.310 --> 06:31:12.320 align:start position:0%
municipalities and finally Mr Speaker if
 
06:31:14.030 --> 06:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
I know that as of today there's an
 
06:31:16.830 --> 06:31:16.840 align:start position:0%

Phillips so happy New Year
 
06:35:38.510 --> 06:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
everybody I'm about to talk about some
 
06:35:41.868 --> 06:35:41.878 align:start position:0%
big dollar figures so stay with me um
 
06:35:43.548 --> 06:35:43.558 align:start position:0%
it's going to get
 
06:35:46.310 --> 06:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
interesting Mr Speaker I rise today in
 
06:35:51.750 --> 06:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
opposition to the motion of itl of HB
 
06:35:54.788 --> 06:35:54.798 align:start position:0%
546 this is relative to school building
 
06:35:56.350 --> 06:35:56.360 align:start position:0%
and the reason why I oppose it is
 
06:35:58.150 --> 06:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
because our public buildings are
 
06:36:01.150 --> 06:36:01.160 align:start position:0%
deteriorating at a faster Pace than we
 
06:36:03.910 --> 06:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
can manage possibly to restore them or
 
06:36:06.830 --> 06:36:06.840 align:start position:0%
to rebuild them on their own um at a
 
06:36:09.070 --> 06:36:09.080 align:start position:0%
district level New Hampshire school
 
06:36:11.350 --> 06:36:11.360 align:start position:0%
districts need our help and providing
 
06:36:13.548 --> 06:36:13.558 align:start position:0%
this necessary and critical piece of
 
06:36:16.070 --> 06:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
public education funding uh the member
 
06:36:16.080 --> 06:36:17.548 align:start position:0%
public education funding uh the member
will

06:36:17.548 --> 06:36:17.558 align:start position:0%
will
 
06:36:20.990 --> 06:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
suspend it's getting awful noisy in here
 
06:36:24.430 --> 06:36:24.440 align:start position:0%
again we're moving along pretty good if
 
06:36:26.590 --> 06:36:26.600 align:start position:0%
you need to have a conversation please
 
06:36:33.510 --> 06:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:36.030 --> 06:36:36.040 align:start position:0%
continue yes New Hampshire schools
 
06:36:37.510 --> 06:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
school districts need our help in
 
06:36:39.310 --> 06:36:39.320 align:start position:0%
providing this necessary and critical
 
06:36:41.910 --> 06:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
piece of public education funding and
 
06:36:44.628 --> 06:36:44.638 align:start position:0%
it's our job as legislators to find a
 
06:36:46.230 --> 06:36:46.240 align:start position:0%
way to meet that
 
06:36:49.030 --> 06:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
need here are the raw facts from our own
 
06:36:51.150 --> 06:36:51.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Education and even our
 
06:36:52.910 --> 06:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
colleague who chairs the education
 
06:36:56.190 --> 06:36:56.200 align:start position:0%
committee there's about 450 public
 
06:36:58.030 --> 06:36:58.040 align:start position:0%
education buildings in our state that
 
06:37:02.788 --> 06:37:02.798 align:start position:0%
serve about 165,000 students who are in
 
06:37:04.788 --> 06:37:04.798 align:start position:0%
grades K through
 
06:37:08.468 --> 06:37:08.478 align:start position:0%
12 about half of 450 of those buildings
 
06:37:10.788 --> 06:37:10.798 align:start position:0%
are over 60 years
 
06:37:13.868 --> 06:37:13.878 align:start position:0%
old these buildings frankly are old and
 
06:37:16.110 --> 06:37:16.120 align:start position:0%
crumbling and the matters only get the
 
06:37:18.030 --> 06:37:18.040 align:start position:0%
facts only get worse that's just a
 
06:37:20.670 --> 06:37:20.680 align:start position:0%
snapshot the problem is these Antiquated
 
06:37:22.910 --> 06:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
buildings are riddled with safety
 
06:37:24.990 --> 06:37:25.000 align:start position:0%
concerns for for instance they're non
 
06:37:27.670 --> 06:37:27.680 align:start position:0%
ADA Compliant there's a lot of imminent
 
06:37:31.670 --> 06:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
danger type risks fire hazard asbest uh
 
06:37:33.990 --> 06:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
lead other hazards like that there's
 
06:37:37.230 --> 06:37:37.240 align:start position:0%
poor air quality water quality concerns
 
06:37:39.628 --> 06:37:39.638 align:start position:0%
there's inefficient Heating and Lighting
 
06:37:42.150 --> 06:37:42.160 align:start position:0%
systems there's sinking foundations
 
06:37:43.910 --> 06:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
structural Integrity issues and of
 
06:37:46.990 --> 06:37:47.000 align:start position:0%
course there are subpar emergency exits
 
06:37:49.070 --> 06:37:49.080 align:start position:0%
which are really troubling other
 
06:37:50.628 --> 06:37:50.638 align:start position:0%
buildings were built for elementary
 
06:37:53.230 --> 06:37:53.240 align:start position:0%
school style students but they're
 
06:37:55.150 --> 06:37:55.160 align:start position:0%
serving in a appropriately High School
 
06:37:57.190 --> 06:37:57.200 align:start position:0%
bodies and frankly they're
 
06:38:00.270 --> 06:38:00.280 align:start position:0%
overcrowded some of these buildings have
 
06:38:02.468 --> 06:38:02.478 align:start position:0%
do not have the capability to facilitate
 
06:38:04.948 --> 06:38:04.958 align:start position:0%
required stem curriculum because they
 
06:38:07.310 --> 06:38:07.320 align:start position:0%
have outdated unsafe or just a complete
 
06:38:09.270 --> 06:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
lack of lab
 
06:38:11.868 --> 06:38:11.878 align:start position:0%
spaces but I want you to understand
 
06:38:14.270 --> 06:38:14.280 align:start position:0%
these are not aesthetic issues these are
 
06:38:17.910 --> 06:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
down to the stud's bone of the building
 
06:38:22.070 --> 06:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
issues and the Doe's informal estimate
 
06:38:24.708 --> 06:38:24.718 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire's total need need for
 
06:38:27.548 --> 06:38:27.558 align:start position:0%
school building Grant eligible funding
 
06:38:29.948 --> 06:38:29.958 align:start position:0%
if there was no $50 million arbitrary
 
06:38:34.190 --> 06:38:34.200 align:start position:0%
cap for the entire 450 buildings that
 
06:38:37.830 --> 06:38:37.840 align:start position:0%
would exceed $120 million per fiscal
 
06:38:40.468 --> 06:38:40.478 align:start position:0%
year to keep up colleagues our $50
 
06:38:43.788 --> 06:38:43.798 align:start position:0%
million a year cap is not getting close
 
06:38:45.670 --> 06:38:45.680 align:start position:0%
to covering the problem we're talking
 
06:38:48.110 --> 06:38:48.120 align:start position:0%
about more than $70 million that go un
 
06:38:51.430 --> 06:38:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:54.230 --> 06:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
year so what we know is that our current
 
06:38:56.150 --> 06:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
funding is not even coming close and of
 
06:38:58.350 --> 06:38:58.360 align:start position:0%
the 17 school districts that applied for
 
06:39:01.190 --> 06:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
the 2425 budget cycle of school building
 
06:39:04.590 --> 06:39:04.600 align:start position:0%
Aid only three school districts were
 
06:39:06.468 --> 06:39:06.478 align:start position:0%
approved for that building Aid funding
 
06:39:08.670 --> 06:39:08.680 align:start position:0%
leaving the last 14 in alert with
 
06:39:11.350 --> 06:39:11.360 align:start position:0%
absolutely no ability um to receive help
 
06:39:14.110 --> 06:39:14.120 align:start position:0%
from the state so why are so many of
 
06:39:16.548 --> 06:39:16.558 align:start position:0%
those projects not being funded and this
 
06:39:18.830 --> 06:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
is really the critical issue that's why
 
06:39:21.628 --> 06:39:21.638 align:start position:0%
the finance committee is taking a look
 
06:39:24.230 --> 06:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
not withstanding the bottleneck from the
 
06:39:26.310 --> 06:39:26.320 align:start position:0%
projects during the 10-year moratorium
 
06:39:28.510 --> 06:39:28.520 align:start position:0%
starting in 2009 where no building Aid
 
06:39:28.520 --> 06:39:29.590 align:start position:0%
starting in 2009 where no building Aid
was

06:39:29.590 --> 06:39:29.600 align:start position:0%
was
 
06:39:33.230 --> 06:39:33.240 align:start position:0%
funded New Hampshire is paying off its
 
06:39:36.110 --> 06:39:36.120 align:start position:0%
debt service to these projects and
 
06:39:37.830 --> 06:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
obligated payments so this is what we
 
06:39:41.310 --> 06:39:41.320 align:start position:0%
call the tail and you'll see that in the
 
06:39:43.868 --> 06:39:43.878 align:start position:0%
calendar to give you an idea of the size
 
06:39:46.548 --> 06:39:46.558 align:start position:0%
of this tail in
 
06:39:50.868 --> 06:39:50.878 align:start position:0%
2024 it's $27.4 million and remember we
 
06:39:53.190 --> 06:39:53.200 align:start position:0%
have a $50 million cap so we're talking
 
06:39:56.468 --> 06:39:56.478 align:start position:0%
about even less than half goes to new
 
06:39:58.750 --> 06:39:58.760 align:start position:0%
projects we're really just paying on the
 
06:40:02.510 --> 06:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:05.670 --> 06:40:05.680 align:start position:0%
hand so the fact is each year the
 
06:40:07.830 --> 06:40:07.840 align:start position:0%
applicant list for the school funding
 
06:40:09.750 --> 06:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
building Aid gets longer and longer and
 
06:40:11.948 --> 06:40:11.958 align:start position:0%
longer and while three buildings come
 
06:40:14.990 --> 06:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
off six more can apply and add to the
 
06:40:18.948 --> 06:40:18.958 align:start position:0%
list guys this is a compounding problem
 
06:40:21.510 --> 06:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
and a stu Observer of this issue would
 
06:40:24.750 --> 06:40:24.760 align:start position:0%
call it really a crisis
 
06:40:27.150 --> 06:40:27.160 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
06:40:30.388 --> 06:40:30.398 align:start position:0%
546 it attempts to move us in the right
 
06:40:32.110 --> 06:40:32.120 align:start position:0%
direction of addressing this crisis in
 
06:40:33.628 --> 06:40:33.638 align:start position:0%
two parts
 
06:40:36.750 --> 06:40:36.760 align:start position:0%
one to have a non-aps continual
 
06:40:38.750 --> 06:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
appropriation of a minimum of $50
 
06:40:41.468 --> 06:40:41.478 align:start position:0%
million per year transferred to the
 
06:40:43.948 --> 06:40:43.958 align:start position:0%
public education building fund in
 
06:40:47.150 --> 06:40:47.160 align:start position:0%
addition to working on that Debt
 
06:40:49.628 --> 06:40:49.638 align:start position:0%
Service what we're saying is that we
 
06:40:51.150 --> 06:40:51.160 align:start position:0%
understand the obligation of playing
 
06:40:53.150 --> 06:40:53.160 align:start position:0%
both off our previous commitments and
 
06:40:55.628 --> 06:40:55.638 align:start position:0%
working on that service but also
 
06:40:57.388 --> 06:40:57.398 align:start position:0%
spending a reasonable amount of money to
 
06:40:59.830 --> 06:40:59.840 align:start position:0%
tackle the real issue at hand with you
 
06:41:01.430 --> 06:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
know addressing the new projects that
 
06:41:03.910 --> 06:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
are desperately needed across the state
 
06:41:07.230 --> 06:41:07.240 align:start position:0%
so let's break down why you know critics
 
06:41:11.628 --> 06:41:11.638 align:start position:0%
of this bill think it's a bad idea so
 
06:41:15.030 --> 06:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
critics are saying it incentivizes
 
06:41:17.110 --> 06:41:17.120 align:start position:0%
overspending this may be an important
 
06:41:18.750 --> 06:41:18.760 align:start position:0%
theoretical argument to have in your
 
06:41:21.310 --> 06:41:21.320 align:start position:0%
mind but it's just Falls flat it's not
 
06:41:24.430 --> 06:41:24.440 align:start position:0%
true no district is spending more money
 
06:41:26.350 --> 06:41:26.360 align:start position:0%
than they can afford on building Aid and
 
06:41:28.230 --> 06:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
that's simply because we know there's a
 
06:41:31.548 --> 06:41:31.558 align:start position:0%
budget process communities are informed
 
06:41:32.708 --> 06:41:32.718 align:start position:0%
that they're going to have to take out
 
06:41:35.830 --> 06:41:35.840 align:start position:0%
loans in addition to building aid funds
 
06:41:38.190 --> 06:41:38.200 align:start position:0%
to support their Community spending on
 
06:41:40.230 --> 06:41:40.240 align:start position:0%
these projects if they can't foot the
 
06:41:42.708 --> 06:41:42.718 align:start position:0%
bill themselves furthermore their school
 
06:41:45.230 --> 06:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
budgets are analyzing the needs of their
 
06:41:48.310 --> 06:41:48.320 align:start position:0%
school systems proposing reasonable
 
06:41:50.310 --> 06:41:50.320 align:start position:0%
prudent budgets that will address those
 
06:41:53.788 --> 06:41:53.798 align:start position:0%
needs and then of course informing their
 
06:41:55.750 --> 06:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
constituents that in order to pass that
 
06:41:58.350 --> 06:41:58.360 align:start position:0%
project they're also going to attempt to
 
06:41:59.788 --> 06:41:59.798 align:start position:0%
apply for this building Aid fund from
 
06:42:02.750 --> 06:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
the state but we might have to go It
 
06:42:06.150 --> 06:42:06.160 align:start position:0%
Alone voters know this when they vote
 
06:42:08.110 --> 06:42:08.120 align:start position:0%
and if they approve those budgets they
 
06:42:10.388 --> 06:42:10.398 align:start position:0%
can afford it if they don't approve
 
06:42:12.070 --> 06:42:12.080 align:start position:0%
those budgets it's obviously not
 
06:42:13.388 --> 06:42:13.398 align:start position:0%
affordable and you're back to the
 
06:42:16.548 --> 06:42:16.558 align:start position:0%
drawing board critics will also
 
06:42:19.910 --> 06:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
say why add more funding to this project
 
06:42:21.750 --> 06:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
you know building Aid
 
06:42:24.350 --> 06:42:24.360 align:start position:0%
Source uh funding source outside the
 
06:42:27.388 --> 06:42:27.398 align:start position:0%
budget process and I'll say look we did
 
06:42:29.590 --> 06:42:29.600 align:start position:0%
attempt to reach um both the governor's
 
06:42:32.190 --> 06:42:32.200 align:start position:0%
proposal and this body's proposal
 
06:42:35.030 --> 06:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
attempted to increase the annual funding
 
06:42:36.868 --> 06:42:36.878 align:start position:0%
but the body on the other side of this
 
06:42:39.628 --> 06:42:39.638 align:start position:0%
wall did not agree with that and reduced
 
06:42:42.830 --> 06:42:42.840 align:start position:0%
it back to the $50 million cap per year
 
06:42:44.350 --> 06:42:44.360 align:start position:0%
what we know is it's time to tell our
 
06:42:46.230 --> 06:42:46.240 align:start position:0%
friends on the other side of the wall
 
06:42:49.110 --> 06:42:49.120 align:start position:0%
that we actually mean that we mean it we
 
06:42:51.548 --> 06:42:51.558 align:start position:0%
want to actually tackle this issue and
 
06:42:54.190 --> 06:42:54.200 align:start position:0%
we'll vote to send it back to them
 
06:42:55.868 --> 06:42:55.878 align:start position:0%
critics are also going to say this is
 
06:42:56.990 --> 06:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
way too
 
06:42:59.510 --> 06:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
expensive um we just cannot afford a
 
06:43:02.150 --> 06:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
maximum of $27 million in addition to
 
06:43:03.868 --> 06:43:03.878 align:start position:0%
what we're already spending per
 
06:43:05.830 --> 06:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
year look it's true that many
 
06:43:07.670 --> 06:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
communities can't afford it and those
 
06:43:09.070 --> 06:43:09.080 align:start position:0%
districts have already been taxed to the
 
06:43:10.510 --> 06:43:10.520 align:start position:0%
hillt and their property taxes can't
 
06:43:12.990 --> 06:43:13.000 align:start position:0%
afford additional expenditures and
 
06:43:15.190 --> 06:43:15.200 align:start position:0%
raises but we know that State's in a
 
06:43:17.708 --> 06:43:17.718 align:start position:0%
better position to act our education
 
06:43:20.948 --> 06:43:20.958 align:start position:0%
trust fund is at an all-time Revenue
 
06:43:23.990 --> 06:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
Surplus thanks to prudent um spending
 
06:43:24.000 --> 06:43:25.270 align:start position:0%
Surplus thanks to prudent um spending
and

06:43:25.270 --> 06:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:43:27.590 --> 06:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
planning the education trust fund is
 
06:43:29.270 --> 06:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
currently the source for building Aid
 
06:43:32.030 --> 06:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
and it's at an excess of 160 million as
 
06:43:34.628 --> 06:43:34.638 align:start position:0%
we stand right now that money is
 
06:43:36.590 --> 06:43:36.600 align:start position:0%
obviously restricted for Educational
 
06:43:38.388 --> 06:43:38.398 align:start position:0%
Funding purposes only and it can't be
 
06:43:41.670 --> 06:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
used in other ways so it's These funds
 
06:43:43.310 --> 06:43:43.320 align:start position:0%
are not going anywhere but neither is
 
06:43:46.270 --> 06:43:46.280 align:start position:0%
this problem and I really it's our up to
 
06:43:48.190 --> 06:43:48.200 align:start position:0%
us to
 
06:43:51.388 --> 06:43:51.398 align:start position:0%
um to make this decision to use these
 
06:43:54.670 --> 06:43:54.680 align:start position:0%
funds in a real positive way
 
06:43:56.590 --> 06:43:56.600 align:start position:0%
critics will also ask what about the
 
06:43:58.510 --> 06:43:58.520 align:start position:0%
communities that previously used these
 
06:44:00.548 --> 06:44:00.558 align:start position:0%
fund or chose not to use these fund and
 
06:44:02.430 --> 06:44:02.440 align:start position:0%
moved forward with their own plan you
 
06:44:04.388 --> 06:44:04.398 align:start position:0%
know what happens to them and I would
 
06:44:07.548 --> 06:44:07.558 align:start position:0%
say the reality is that if we understand
 
06:44:10.830 --> 06:44:10.840 align:start position:0%
buildings have a 35 to 40 year turnover
 
06:44:13.830 --> 06:44:13.840 align:start position:0%
of useful life that these communities
 
06:44:16.350 --> 06:44:16.360 align:start position:0%
may not need this Fund in the next 5 10
 
06:44:18.590 --> 06:44:18.600 align:start position:0%
or 15 years but
 
06:44:20.750 --> 06:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
eventually these communities will also
 
06:44:22.948 --> 06:44:22.958 align:start position:0%
need to return to this fund and yes it
 
06:44:26.150 --> 06:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
will be available for them as
 
06:44:28.230 --> 06:44:28.240 align:start position:0%
well all right I'm getting span here
 
06:44:31.310 --> 06:44:31.320 align:start position:0%
sorry guys critics will ask why should
 
06:44:32.990 --> 06:44:33.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire be funding more school
 
06:44:34.910 --> 06:44:34.920 align:start position:0%
building Aid if we know there are fewer
 
06:44:36.430 --> 06:44:36.440 align:start position:0%
students and there's a declining
 
06:44:38.590 --> 06:44:38.600 align:start position:0%
population across the state and the
 
06:44:42.388 --> 06:44:42.398 align:start position:0%
answer to that is easy New Hampshire's a
 
06:44:44.350 --> 06:44:44.360 align:start position:0%
highly respected Department of Education
 
06:44:46.670 --> 06:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
administrator put it this way with a
 
06:44:49.150 --> 06:44:49.160 align:start position:0%
metaphor just because fewer cars are
 
06:44:51.070 --> 06:44:51.080 align:start position:0%
crossing over a bridge doesn't mean the
 
06:44:54.270 --> 06:44:54.280 align:start position:0%
bridge has to be less safe and I agree
 
06:44:56.468 --> 06:44:56.478 align:start position:0%
just because there are fewer kids moving
 
06:44:57.868 --> 06:44:57.878 align:start position:0%
through the threshold of our school
 
06:44:59.750 --> 06:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
doors does not mean that those school
 
06:45:01.708 --> 06:45:01.718 align:start position:0%
buildings need to be less safe less
 
06:45:03.510 --> 06:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
modern and less
 
06:45:05.868 --> 06:45:05.878 align:start position:0%
healthy we owe it to our kids to provide
 
06:45:07.990 --> 06:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
building aid for you know those exact
 
06:45:10.788 --> 06:45:10.798 align:start position:0%
safe healthy and um modern
 
06:45:12.910 --> 06:45:12.920 align:start position:0%
schools so if you're still looking for
 
06:45:14.910 --> 06:45:14.920 align:start position:0%
three reasons to vote for this bill it's
 
06:45:14.920 --> 06:45:16.190 align:start position:0%
three reasons to vote for this bill it's
this

06:45:16.190 --> 06:45:16.200 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:45:20.030 --> 06:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
one HB 546 is stakeholder approved we've
 
06:45:21.868 --> 06:45:21.878 align:start position:0%
got the New Hampshire School Board
 
06:45:23.948 --> 06:45:23.958 align:start position:0%
Association the New Hampshire school
 
06:45:25.750 --> 06:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
board authority the New Hampshire school
 
06:45:27.628 --> 06:45:27.638 align:start position:0%
funding fairness project even the
 
06:45:29.628 --> 06:45:29.638 align:start position:0%
Department of Education on board saying
 
06:45:31.750 --> 06:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
that it would be helpful to give a more
 
06:45:34.788 --> 06:45:34.798 align:start position:0%
stable um and consistent allocation to
 
06:45:36.590 --> 06:45:36.600 align:start position:0%
schools year after year so that people
 
06:45:40.670 --> 06:45:40.680 align:start position:0%
know how to plan to HB 546 is proactive
 
06:45:42.388 --> 06:45:42.398 align:start position:0%
legislation we know that there's been a
 
06:45:44.910 --> 06:45:44.920 align:start position:0%
big Supreme Court case order that's just
 
06:45:47.628 --> 06:45:47.638 align:start position:0%
come down in the dual cases of conal and
 
06:45:49.948 --> 06:45:49.958 align:start position:0%
Rand where the New Hampshire general
 
06:45:52.070 --> 06:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
court has been put on notice notice that
 
06:45:54.788 --> 06:45:54.798 align:start position:0%
we are doing it wrong that we failed and
 
06:45:56.670 --> 06:45:56.680 align:start position:0%
that we have to make a big change this
 
06:45:58.868 --> 06:45:58.878 align:start position:0%
is important we have been ordered by the
 
06:46:01.150 --> 06:46:01.160 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court of this state to determine
 
06:46:02.548 --> 06:46:02.558 align:start position:0%
how we're going to make a significant
 
06:46:04.230 --> 06:46:04.240 align:start position:0%
change for the future of Education
 
06:46:07.270 --> 06:46:07.280 align:start position:0%
funding this I propose is a good first
 
06:46:11.430 --> 06:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
step last HB 546 is a good and wise
 
06:46:13.190 --> 06:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
legislation and this is the most
 
06:46:15.830 --> 06:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
important point today these buildings
 
06:46:18.150 --> 06:46:18.160 align:start position:0%
are not just temples of our educational
 
06:46:20.468 --> 06:46:20.478 align:start position:0%
you know progress in our communities
 
06:46:22.388 --> 06:46:22.398 align:start position:0%
they're also our Civic centers of
 
06:46:24.590 --> 06:46:24.600 align:start position:0%
Engagement people are learning there but
 
06:46:26.548 --> 06:46:26.558 align:start position:0%
people are gathering there and taking a
 
06:46:27.830 --> 06:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
little bit of ownership of their
 
06:46:30.388 --> 06:46:30.398 align:start position:0%
Community for this building and I ask
 
06:46:34.510 --> 06:46:34.520 align:start position:0%
you my colleagues to please support this
 
06:46:36.270 --> 06:46:36.280 align:start position:0%
investment not only into the
 
06:46:38.310 --> 06:46:38.320 align:start position:0%
legislature's Constitutional obligation
 
06:46:40.110 --> 06:46:40.120 align:start position:0%
to provide public education to New
 
06:46:42.070 --> 06:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire students but also an
 
06:46:43.708 --> 06:46:43.718 align:start position:0%
investment into the physical
 
06:46:45.830 --> 06:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
representation of our community Civic
 
06:46:48.270 --> 06:46:48.280 align:start position:0%
Corp for these reasons and More Mr
 
06:46:49.948 --> 06:46:49.958 align:start position:0%
Speaker I ask my colleagues to vote no
 
06:46:52.788 --> 06:46:52.798 align:start position:0%
on the motion of itl on HB 546 so that
 
06:46:57.788 --> 06:46:57.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:09.750 --> 06:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:11.868 --> 06:47:11.878 align:start position:0%
amri thank you Mr
 
06:47:14.990 --> 06:47:15.000 align:start position:0%
Speaker my colleague made my
 
06:47:18.388 --> 06:47:18.398 align:start position:0%
case I'm in finance the guidance to
 
06:47:20.708 --> 06:47:20.718 align:start position:0%
finance is not to spend more money the
 
06:47:24.548 --> 06:47:24.558 align:start position:0%
guidance to finance is to be Fair
 
06:47:26.350 --> 06:47:26.360 align:start position:0%
thoughtful and
 
06:47:28.310 --> 06:47:28.320 align:start position:0%
considerate which we have been for
 
06:47:31.388 --> 06:47:31.398 align:start position:0%
several years we have budgeted 50
 
06:47:34.670 --> 06:47:34.680 align:start position:0%
million for the last three budget cycles
 
06:47:37.230 --> 06:47:37.240 align:start position:0%
and what that $50 million is paying off
 
06:47:38.948 --> 06:47:38.958 align:start position:0%
is some real bad decisions that were
 
06:47:42.750 --> 06:47:42.760 align:start position:0%
made 20 years ago and current debt
 
06:47:47.270 --> 06:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
service for current borrowing Now The
 
06:47:50.350 --> 06:47:50.360 align:start position:0%
Debt Service does come out of the $50
 
06:47:53.670 --> 06:47:53.680 align:start position:0%
million the the uh fiscal note on this
 
06:47:56.190 --> 06:47:56.200 align:start position:0%
says that this bill will increase
 
06:47:58.990 --> 06:47:59.000 align:start position:0%
spending by $27
 
06:48:01.708 --> 06:48:01.718 align:start position:0%
million it was a pretty easy decision to
 
06:48:03.990 --> 06:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
say I don't I'm not really excited about
 
06:48:06.230 --> 06:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
spending an additional $27
 
06:48:09.910 --> 06:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
million so that's why we support the
 
06:48:12.670 --> 06:48:12.680 align:start position:0%
itl I think my colleague made a a very
 
06:48:16.830 --> 06:48:16.840 align:start position:0%
good case for education for p uh funding
 
06:48:20.868 --> 06:48:20.878 align:start position:0%
School Renovations but keep in mind when
 
06:48:24.910 --> 06:48:24.920 align:start position:0%
I joined Finance uh about 10 years ago
 
06:48:27.830 --> 06:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
there were 220,000 students in this
 
06:48:31.110 --> 06:48:31.120 align:start position:0%
state today there are
 
06:48:34.230 --> 06:48:34.240 align:start position:0%
155,000 students a lot of schools are
 
06:48:35.990 --> 06:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
going to be abandoned in a very short
 
06:48:38.670 --> 06:48:38.680 align:start position:0%
period of time and merged with other
 
06:48:40.708 --> 06:48:40.718 align:start position:0%
communities we there's just not enough
 
06:48:42.830 --> 06:48:42.840 align:start position:0%
students anymore to have as many schools
 
06:48:46.708 --> 06:48:46.718 align:start position:0%
as we have so I ask you to support the
 
06:48:49.868 --> 06:48:49.878 align:start position:0%
itl and not approve an additional $27
 
06:48:52.110 --> 06:48:52.120 align:start position:0%
million thank you Mr
 
06:48:52.120 --> 06:48:57.150 align:start position:0%
million thank you Mr

thank you Mr
 
06:50:59.350 --> 06:50:59.360 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr
 
06:51:01.910 --> 06:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that we are woefully
 
06:51:04.468 --> 06:51:04.478 align:start position:0%
behind in our responsibility to provide
 
06:51:06.788 --> 06:51:06.798 align:start position:0%
Clean safe and modern schools for the
 
06:51:08.030 --> 06:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
children of New
 
06:51:10.350 --> 06:51:10.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and if I know that this bill
 
06:51:12.070 --> 06:51:12.080 align:start position:0%
provides an excellent opportunity to
 
06:51:14.230 --> 06:51:14.240 align:start position:0%
provide additional support beyond what
 
06:51:16.150 --> 06:51:16.160 align:start position:0%
was provided in the original budget and
 
06:51:18.430 --> 06:51:18.440 align:start position:0%
that this is both a fiscally responsible
 
06:51:21.310 --> 06:51:21.320 align:start position:0%
move as well as a governmentally and
 
06:51:24.590 --> 06:51:24.600 align:start position:0%
civically responsible move move and if I
 
06:51:26.868 --> 06:51:26.878 align:start position:0%
know that even if this leaves several
 
06:51:29.948 --> 06:51:29.958 align:start position:0%
many projects yet to be addressed this
 
06:51:32.150 --> 06:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
funding provides needed help to several
 
06:51:34.990 --> 06:51:35.000 align:start position:0%
additional schools perhaps your school
 
06:51:37.468 --> 06:51:37.478 align:start position:0%
and will put us on a better path towards
 
06:51:39.388 --> 06:51:39.398 align:start position:0%
addressing the school building issues
 
06:51:41.750 --> 06:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
that we face when I now press the red

Cory thank you Mr Speaker if I know that
 
06:52:03.110 --> 06:52:03.120 align:start position:0%
the school building aid program was
 
06:52:06.190 --> 06:52:06.200 align:start position:0%
created decades ago when burgeoning
 
06:52:09.590 --> 06:52:09.600 align:start position:0%
enrollment required new buildings it was
 
06:52:12.468 --> 06:52:12.478 align:start position:0%
never intended to pay for repairs and
 
06:52:14.788 --> 06:52:14.798 align:start position:0%
maintenance those are
 
06:52:17.830 --> 06:52:17.840 align:start position:0%
always a responsibility of the district
 
06:52:21.110 --> 06:52:21.120 align:start position:0%
and if I further know that declining
 
06:52:24.868 --> 06:52:24.878 align:start position:0%
enrollment has left some buildings empty
 
06:52:27.310 --> 06:52:27.320 align:start position:0%
and that if the district sold them at
 
06:52:29.388 --> 06:52:29.398 align:start position:0%
best price they should have plenty of
 
06:52:31.948 --> 06:52:31.958 align:start position:0%
money for other construction and not
 
06:52:36.190 --> 06:52:36.200 align:start position:0%

06:58:09.590 --> 06:58:09.600 align:start position:0%
in opposition to the motion of itl for
 
06:58:12.468 --> 06:58:12.478 align:start position:0%

School meals first let's talk about this
 
06:58:23.868 --> 06:58:23.878 align:start position:0%
what this bill would actually do 601
 
06:58:27.030 --> 06:58:27.040 align:start position:0%
enables let me say that again 601
 
06:58:29.510 --> 06:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
enables the Department of Education to
 
06:58:31.948 --> 06:58:31.958 align:start position:0%
apply to participate in the USDA pilot
 
06:58:33.788 --> 06:58:33.798 align:start position:0%

06:58:35.990 --> 06:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
certification that methodology for free

and reduced price School meals covering
 
06:58:42.990 --> 06:58:43.000 align:start position:0%
K through 12 kids it's this bill D
 
06:58:46.070 --> 06:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
stigmatizes and simplifies the existing
 
06:58:48.948 --> 06:58:48.958 align:start position:0%
process of requiring parents to fill out
 
06:58:51.750 --> 06:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
paper enrollment forms and it really
 
06:58:54.990 --> 06:58:55.000 align:start position:0%
tries to capture the kids who qualify
 
06:58:57.230 --> 06:58:57.240 align:start position:0%
and need these meals but for some reason
 
06:58:59.590 --> 06:58:59.600 align:start position:0%
don't return the
 
06:59:02.788 --> 06:59:02.798 align:start position:0%
forms if the state already has data on
 
06:59:04.788 --> 06:59:04.798 align:start position:0%
existing Medicaid eligible families and
 
06:59:08.548 --> 06:59:08.558 align:start position:0%
kids throughout DHHS records this data
 
06:59:10.670 --> 06:59:10.680 align:start position:0%
set could securely and accurately be
 
06:59:12.868 --> 06:59:12.878 align:start position:0%
shared with the Department of Education
 
06:59:14.830 --> 06:59:14.840 align:start position:0%
to automatically enroll those eligible
 
06:59:16.510 --> 06:59:16.520 align:start position:0%
kids into the free and reduced meal
 
06:59:19.388 --> 06:59:19.398 align:start position:0%
program without the existing unreliable
 
06:59:21.990 --> 06:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
and inefficient step of returning that
 
06:59:24.948 --> 06:59:24.958 align:start position:0%
paper paper enrollment thank you so why
 
06:59:26.750 --> 06:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
is the Medicaid direct certification
 
06:59:28.868 --> 06:59:28.878 align:start position:0%
process for free ose meal application
 
06:59:31.270 --> 06:59:31.280 align:start position:0%
important we know that New Hampshire
 
06:59:34.030 --> 06:59:34.040 align:start position:0%
kids are hungry and food insufficiency
 
06:59:36.590 --> 06:59:36.600 align:start position:0%
is on the rise for our students we all
 
06:59:38.510 --> 06:59:38.520 align:start position:0%
have anecdotes but we don't need to rely
 
06:59:40.430 --> 06:59:40.440 align:start position:0%
on them because we have the US Census
 
06:59:43.150 --> 06:59:43.160 align:start position:0%
pulse survey conducted by the experts at
 
06:59:45.310 --> 06:59:45.320 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire hunger solutions that
 
06:59:48.150 --> 06:59:48.160 align:start position:0%
shows us approximately 200,000 kids in
 
06:59:50.868 --> 06:59:50.878 align:start position:0%
our state live in food insecure
 
06:59:53.110 --> 06:59:53.120 align:start position:0%
households the State also notes that
 
06:59:55.468 --> 06:59:55.478 align:start position:0%
more kids were taking advantage of the
 
06:59:57.350 --> 06:59:57.360 align:start position:0%
free and reduced meal program since the
 
06:59:59.190 --> 06:59:59.200 align:start position:0%

07:00:01.788 --> 07:00:01.798 align:start position:0%
Department of education's own
 
07:00:04.230 --> 07:00:04.240 align:start position:0%
data so if we know there's an increased
 
07:00:06.948 --> 07:00:06.958 align:start position:0%
need what is pres preventing New
 
07:00:09.548 --> 07:00:09.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from feeding these kids I have
 
07:00:12.510 --> 07:00:12.520 align:start position:0%
to ask when did feeding hungry at risk
 
07:00:15.510 --> 07:00:15.520 align:start position:0%
kids become such a bad thing the long
 
07:00:19.070 --> 07:00:19.080 align:start position:0%
and short of it folks the answer is
 
07:00:20.910 --> 07:00:20.920 align:start position:0%
money New
 
07:00:22.750 --> 07:00:22.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there their adequacy
 
07:00:24.388 --> 07:00:24.398 align:start position:0%
calculation for school funding is
 
07:00:27.230 --> 07:00:27.240 align:start position:0%
significantly impact on uh is
 
07:00:29.230 --> 07:00:29.240 align:start position:0%
significantly impacted on the Medicaid
 
07:00:31.590 --> 07:00:31.600 align:start position:0%
direct certification because any
 
07:00:33.750 --> 07:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
increase across the board on free and
 
07:00:35.910 --> 07:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
reduced meal counts would result in a
 
07:00:38.430 --> 07:00:38.440 align:start position:0%
corresponding increase in the adequacy
 
07:00:38.440 --> 07:00:39.430 align:start position:0%
corresponding increase in the adequacy
aid

07:00:39.430 --> 07:00:39.440 align:start position:0%
aid
 
07:00:42.628 --> 07:00:42.638 align:start position:0%
calculation over the Baseline so one
 
07:00:44.708 --> 07:00:44.718 align:start position:0%
estimate by the Department of Education
 
07:00:47.430 --> 07:00:47.440 align:start position:0%
is that a 15% increase in the amount of
 
07:00:50.990 --> 07:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
free and reduced School Meal kids would
 
07:00:52.788 --> 07:00:52.798 align:start position:0%
result in approximately
 
07:00:56.750 --> 07:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
wait for it $114 million increase in the
 
07:00:59.270 --> 07:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
adequacy for fiscal year
 
07:01:02.388 --> 07:01:02.398 align:start position:0%
2027 that's the first point at which a
 
07:01:04.270 --> 07:01:04.280 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact of the direct
 
07:01:06.030 --> 07:01:06.040 align:start position:0%
certification would really start to show
 
07:01:09.110 --> 07:01:09.120 align:start position:0%
up here in our state another estimate by
 
07:01:11.468 --> 07:01:11.478 align:start position:0%
the same body the doe provides that
 
07:01:14.670 --> 07:01:14.680 align:start position:0%
projected increase of over $190 million
 
07:01:17.510 --> 07:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
over the bium but to be fair the
 
07:01:19.350 --> 07:01:19.360 align:start position:0%
department of education's analyst can
 
07:01:21.030 --> 07:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
actually provide a
 
07:01:24.548 --> 07:01:24.558 align:start position:0%
stic statistically meaningful margin of
 
07:01:26.628 --> 07:01:26.638 align:start position:0%
error and it's likely that the actual
 
07:01:29.070 --> 07:01:29.080 align:start position:0%
estimates fluctuate by tens of millions
 
07:01:31.948 --> 07:01:31.958 align:start position:0%
of dollars so we as legislators
 
07:01:34.990 --> 07:01:35.000 align:start position:0%
legislators are left guessing what is
 
07:01:37.910 --> 07:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
the actual amount of such a program what
 
07:01:41.190 --> 07:01:41.200 align:start position:0%
is that impact even if we know it's
 
07:01:43.310 --> 07:01:43.320 align:start position:0%
significant so I'm asking you to open
 
07:01:47.070 --> 07:01:47.080 align:start position:0%
your hearts and Minds EX look to the
 
07:01:49.310 --> 07:01:49.320 align:start position:0%
possibility of accepting this policy and
 
07:01:51.030 --> 07:01:51.040 align:start position:0%
the way we do that is by dispelling some
 
07:01:53.270 --> 07:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
of the critiques
 
07:01:54.468 --> 07:01:54.478 align:start position:0%
the estimate of the Department of
 
07:01:56.750 --> 07:01:56.760 align:start position:0%
Education that it could be up to $190
 
07:02:00.070 --> 07:02:00.080 align:start position:0%
million over the bium and this idea that
 
07:02:01.708 --> 07:02:01.718 align:start position:0%
it's too expensive and our education
 
07:02:05.190 --> 07:02:05.200 align:start position:0%
trust fund can't um possibly support it
 
07:02:06.788 --> 07:02:06.798 align:start position:0%
well we know according to the Department
 
07:02:09.350 --> 07:02:09.360 align:start position:0%
of Education that in their own analysis
 
07:02:11.310 --> 07:02:11.320 align:start position:0%
the estimates provided are unreliable
 
07:02:13.830 --> 07:02:13.840 align:start position:0%
because first the adequacy formula
 
07:02:16.510 --> 07:02:16.520 align:start position:0%
relies heavily on inflated free and
 
07:02:19.708 --> 07:02:19.718 align:start position:0%
reduced meal program numbers since um
 
07:02:23.030 --> 07:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
that pandemic era waiver was in effect
 
07:02:25.910 --> 07:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
we also know that it's unreliable
 
07:02:28.430 --> 07:02:28.440 align:start position:0%
because Property Data also fluctuates
 
07:02:29.788 --> 07:02:29.798 align:start position:0%
vastly year
 
07:02:32.830 --> 07:02:32.840 align:start position:0%
toe so it's important to acknowledge
 
07:02:35.310 --> 07:02:35.320 align:start position:0%
that the change to direct certification
 
07:02:38.070 --> 07:02:38.080 align:start position:0%
will cause a significant impact on to
 
07:02:40.670 --> 07:02:40.680 align:start position:0%
our budget but that significant impact
 
07:02:43.548 --> 07:02:43.558 align:start position:0%
is already approaching us on the
 
07:02:45.990 --> 07:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
horizon don't forget that the education
 
07:02:48.190 --> 07:02:48.200 align:start position:0%
trust fund is strong it's currently at
 
07:02:51.468 --> 07:02:51.478 align:start position:0%
$160 million with the largest revenue
 
07:02:53.150 --> 07:02:53.160 align:start position:0%
collection months of March and April
 
07:02:55.830 --> 07:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
coming just around the corner the state
 
07:02:58.350 --> 07:02:58.360 align:start position:0%
is an all-time Revenue Surplus and we
 
07:03:00.548 --> 07:03:00.558 align:start position:0%
should not be afraid to use it remember
 
07:03:02.070 --> 07:03:02.080 align:start position:0%
that the education trust fund is
 
07:03:03.868 --> 07:03:03.878 align:start position:0%
restricted to be utilized for
 
07:03:06.030 --> 07:03:06.040 align:start position:0%
educational expenditures
 
07:03:09.310 --> 07:03:09.320 align:start position:0%
only and that this cause is a worthy
 
07:03:11.590 --> 07:03:11.600 align:start position:0%
cause what better than feeding our
 
07:03:14.468 --> 07:03:14.478 align:start position:0%
neediest kids at school when our coffers
 
07:03:14.478 --> 07:03:15.350 align:start position:0%
neediest kids at school when our coffers
are

07:03:15.350 --> 07:03:15.360 align:start position:0%
are
 
07:03:17.750 --> 07:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
overflowing there's also a critique that
 
07:03:19.510 --> 07:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
we've already changed our Ed education
 
07:03:21.150 --> 07:03:21.160 align:start position:0%
adequacy formula in the last budget
 
07:03:24.430 --> 07:03:24.440 align:start position:0%
cycle so so why would we do it again
 
07:03:25.990 --> 07:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
look it's true that we did make a
 
07:03:28.190 --> 07:03:28.200 align:start position:0%
significant increase to education
 
07:03:29.548 --> 07:03:29.558 align:start position:0%
spending during the bipartison
 
07:03:31.468 --> 07:03:31.478 align:start position:0%
negotiations of our last budget cycle
 
07:03:34.270 --> 07:03:34.280 align:start position:0%
and it to be fair it's a historic and
 
07:03:36.270 --> 07:03:36.280 align:start position:0%
commendable bipartisan effort from this
 
07:03:38.030 --> 07:03:38.040 align:start position:0%
chamber and the one behind
 
07:03:38.040 --> 07:03:39.708 align:start position:0%
chamber and the one behind
us

07:03:39.708 --> 07:03:39.718 align:start position:0%
us
 
07:03:42.788 --> 07:03:42.798 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't affect this budget as
 
07:03:45.150 --> 07:03:45.160 align:start position:0%
much and we should remember that this
 
07:03:47.830 --> 07:03:47.840 align:start position:0%
decision to change wouldn't affect us in
 
07:03:51.190 --> 07:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
a fiscal impact for many years to come
 
07:03:53.310 --> 07:03:53.320 align:start position:0%
the other reality is that we've already
 
07:03:54.590 --> 07:03:54.600 align:start position:0%
been ordered by the New Hampshire
 
07:03:57.510 --> 07:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court to make a significant
 
07:03:59.788 --> 07:03:59.798 align:start position:0%
change in the way we provide a
 
07:04:02.230 --> 07:04:02.240 align:start position:0%
constitutionally adequate public
 
07:04:05.510 --> 07:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
education a bigger and more radical
 
07:04:07.590 --> 07:04:07.600 align:start position:0%
change has been ordered by our court and
 
07:04:10.070 --> 07:04:10.080 align:start position:0%
we as legislators have the important
 
07:04:13.030 --> 07:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
task of meeting this challenge here this
 
07:04:15.070 --> 07:04:15.080 align:start position:0%
bill is our chance for us to make
 
07:04:17.788 --> 07:04:17.798 align:start position:0%
another historic and commendable
 
07:04:20.230 --> 07:04:20.240 align:start position:0%
change there's considerable concerns
 
07:04:22.030 --> 07:04:22.040 align:start position:0%
about privacy rights that we keep
 
07:04:24.670 --> 07:04:24.680 align:start position:0%
hearing about many people are saying
 
07:04:26.270 --> 07:04:26.280 align:start position:0%
they're concerned about different state
 
07:04:29.350 --> 07:04:29.360 align:start position:0%
agencies sharing information um without
 
07:04:32.070 --> 07:04:32.080 align:start position:0%
consent and I think it's best to leave
 
07:04:34.788 --> 07:04:34.798 align:start position:0%
the other B's testimony um as an example
 
07:04:37.548 --> 07:04:37.558 align:start position:0%
of why this is not a significant
 
07:04:40.110 --> 07:04:40.120 align:start position:0%
concern during the other B's hearings on
 
07:04:43.350 --> 07:04:43.360 align:start position:0%
the matter a simple fix was proposed to
 
07:04:45.430 --> 07:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
avoid privacy concerns that have been
 
07:04:47.030 --> 07:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
raised by allowing the Medicaid
 
07:04:49.590 --> 07:04:49.600 align:start position:0%
applicant to authorize sharing of data
 
07:04:51.230 --> 07:04:51.240 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Education at the
 
07:04:52.830 --> 07:04:52.840 align:start position:0%
time of
 
07:04:54.948 --> 07:04:54.958 align:start position:0%
application similarly allowing the
 
07:04:57.350 --> 07:04:57.360 align:start position:0%
Department of Education to take to make
 
07:05:00.388 --> 07:05:00.398 align:start position:0%
a free and reduced meal application this
 
07:05:02.990 --> 07:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
applicant the parent presumably could
 
07:05:04.830 --> 07:05:04.840 align:start position:0%
authorize the Department of Education to
 
07:05:06.590 --> 07:05:06.600 align:start position:0%
verify its Medicaid enrollment with the
 
07:05:08.670 --> 07:05:08.680 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
07:05:10.230 --> 07:05:10.240 align:start position:0%
simply by checking a box on the
 
07:05:13.310 --> 07:05:13.320 align:start position:0%
application form we are further assured
 
07:05:15.910 --> 07:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
that the few staff at DHHS and the
 
07:05:17.270 --> 07:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
Department of Education would actually
 
07:05:19.788 --> 07:05:19.798 align:start position:0%
have access to this limited student or
 
07:05:21.310 --> 07:05:21.320 align:start position:0%
parental information because this
 
07:05:23.628 --> 07:05:23.638 align:start position:0%
program was a computer-based data match
 
07:05:26.590 --> 07:05:26.600 align:start position:0%
program we even know that fewer staff at
 
07:05:28.910 --> 07:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
our local schools would have access to
 
07:05:30.388 --> 07:05:30.398 align:start position:0%
this information as
 
07:05:30.398 --> 07:05:32.310 align:start position:0%
this information as
well

07:05:32.310 --> 07:05:32.320 align:start position:0%
well
 
07:05:35.708 --> 07:05:35.718 align:start position:0%
so while we have an example from our
 
07:05:37.468 --> 07:05:37.478 align:start position:0%
past that even gives us greater
 
07:05:39.948 --> 07:05:39.958 align:start position:0%
Assurance we know that privacy concerns
 
07:05:41.990 --> 07:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
have not been raised in the 16 years
 
07:05:43.948 --> 07:05:43.958 align:start position:0%
that the New Hampshire um state
 
07:05:45.708 --> 07:05:45.718 align:start position:0%
government has been directly certifying
 
07:05:48.590 --> 07:05:48.600 align:start position:0%
children based on snap and tanif program
 
07:05:50.270 --> 07:05:50.280 align:start position:0%
and that the state is confident that
 
07:05:51.750 --> 07:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
they'll be able to maintain these
 
07:05:53.628 --> 07:05:53.638 align:start position:0%
constitutional parameters of privacy for
 
07:05:56.190 --> 07:05:56.200 align:start position:0%
Medicaid direct certification as
 
07:05:59.030 --> 07:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
well all right last Point parental
 
07:06:01.510 --> 07:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
rights we hear about this all the time
 
07:06:02.510 --> 07:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
parents don't want their children
 
07:06:05.110 --> 07:06:05.120 align:start position:0%
enrolled for a program that they haven't
 
07:06:07.788 --> 07:06:07.798 align:start position:0%
consented to and the easy fix that we
 
07:06:09.990 --> 07:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
just talked about that the other body
 
07:06:12.750 --> 07:06:12.760 align:start position:0%
proposed is one way that the Medicaid
 
07:06:14.430 --> 07:06:14.440 align:start position:0%
applicant process ensures parents are
 
07:06:16.548 --> 07:06:16.558 align:start position:0%
given ample notice to consent the
 
07:06:19.310 --> 07:06:19.320 align:start position:0%
participation in the fnr program
 
07:06:21.270 --> 07:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
additional efforts at PR providing
 
07:06:23.708 --> 07:06:23.718 align:start position:0%
parent notice can be made including an
 
07:06:25.990 --> 07:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
opt out and that exists in this
 
07:06:28.190 --> 07:06:28.200 align:start position:0%
legislation as always parents are given
 
07:06:29.830 --> 07:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
the tools to be informed about the
 
07:06:32.110 --> 07:06:32.120 align:start position:0%
program and are in control of their
 
07:06:34.190 --> 07:06:34.200 align:start position:0%
children's participation in it but let's
 
07:06:36.190 --> 07:06:36.200 align:start position:0%
not throw out the possibility of an
 
07:06:38.670 --> 07:06:38.680 align:start position:0%
efficient fnr enrollment program through
 
07:06:40.590 --> 07:06:40.600 align:start position:0%
Medicaid direct certification because of
 
07:06:42.350 --> 07:06:42.360 align:start position:0%
this Loosely based
 
07:06:45.708 --> 07:06:45.718 align:start position:0%
argument guys in conclusion many of us
 
07:06:47.270 --> 07:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
believe that feeding hungry kids at
 
07:06:49.270 --> 07:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
school is a natural progression of our
 
07:06:51.788 --> 07:06:51.798 align:start position:0%
legislation here in the state if not
 
07:06:53.788 --> 07:06:53.798 align:start position:0%
today many believe it will eventually
 
07:06:57.548 --> 07:06:57.558 align:start position:0%
become the law so now is the time to
 
07:06:58.990 --> 07:06:59.000 align:start position:0%
allow New Hampshire to spend a little
 
07:07:00.548 --> 07:07:00.558 align:start position:0%
more on her most needy kids because
 
07:07:02.910 --> 07:07:02.920 align:start position:0%
we've been ordered by a court in part to
 
07:07:04.948 --> 07:07:04.958 align:start position:0%
do so and because we're benefiting from
 
07:07:07.070 --> 07:07:07.080 align:start position:0%
this historic Revenue Surplus that make
 
07:07:10.310 --> 07:07:10.320 align:start position:0%
this endeavor possible this enabling
 
07:07:13.030 --> 07:07:13.040 align:start position:0%
legislation is not only feasible it's
 
07:07:15.270 --> 07:07:15.280 align:start position:0%
also morally imperative to Pro
 
07:07:17.750 --> 07:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
prioritize childhood hunger in a rich
 
07:07:19.750 --> 07:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
developed Society New Hampshire children
 
07:07:21.990 --> 07:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
are a collective future and everyone
 
07:07:24.350 --> 07:07:24.360 align:start position:0%
benefits when they're fed and healthy
 
07:07:25.708 --> 07:07:25.718 align:start position:0%
because they make better informed
 
07:07:27.948 --> 07:07:27.958 align:start position:0%
citizens and so Mr Speaker for these
 
07:07:29.670 --> 07:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
reasons I urge you to vote no on the
 
07:07:33.350 --> 07:07:33.360 align:start position:0%
motion of itl against HB 601 and thank
 
07:07:39.548 --> 07:07:39.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:42.310 --> 07:07:42.320 align:start position:0%
vote representative papovich meller is
 
07:07:50.430 --> 07:07:50.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:50.440 --> 07:07:57.270 align:start position:0%
 
report

07:07:57.270 --> 07:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:59.830 --> 07:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you Mr Speaker and uh
 
07:08:01.468 --> 07:08:01.478 align:start position:0%
distinguished colleagues I will be as
 
07:08:04.910 --> 07:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
brief as possible the fact that HB 601
 
07:08:07.030 --> 07:08:07.040 align:start position:0%
is not about addressing hunger in public
 
07:08:09.548 --> 07:08:09.558 align:start position:0%
schools is easily shown by its price tag
 
07:08:13.190 --> 07:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
190 million over a bium to be to benefit
 
07:08:17.990 --> 07:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
about 7,700 children that's over 25k per
 
07:08:22.150 --> 07:08:22.160 align:start position:0%
kid per banum or $68 per kid per day
 
07:08:24.750 --> 07:08:24.760 align:start position:0%
unless our schools School cafeterias
 
07:08:26.750 --> 07:08:26.760 align:start position:0%
have Micheline stars that kind of money
 
07:08:30.510 --> 07:08:30.520 align:start position:0%
ain't paying for food so do we have a
 
07:08:32.510 --> 07:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
hunger problem in New
 
07:08:34.670 --> 07:08:34.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire yes even though one could
 
07:08:36.270 --> 07:08:36.280 align:start position:0%
argue with a definition of food
 
07:08:38.830 --> 07:08:38.840 align:start position:0%
insufficiency that combines people who
 
07:08:40.788 --> 07:08:40.798 align:start position:0%
are genuinely not having enough food
 
07:08:42.750 --> 07:08:42.760 align:start position:0%
with people who have enough food but
 
07:08:44.708 --> 07:08:44.718 align:start position:0%
don't have exactly the food they like
 
07:08:46.510 --> 07:08:46.520 align:start position:0%
based on the definition my family is
 
07:08:48.350 --> 07:08:48.360 align:start position:0%
food insufficient and trust me we are
 
07:08:48.360 --> 07:08:49.788 align:start position:0%
food insufficient and trust me we are
anything

07:08:49.788 --> 07:08:49.798 align:start position:0%
anything
 
07:08:52.070 --> 07:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
but now
 
07:08:54.788 --> 07:08:54.798 align:start position:0%
the state does have hungry families what
 
07:08:57.388 --> 07:08:57.398 align:start position:0%
we don't have any information on any
 
07:08:59.190 --> 07:08:59.200 align:start position:0%
documentation to indicate that is
 
07:09:01.670 --> 07:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
happening are kids who are not getting
 
07:09:03.628 --> 07:09:03.638 align:start position:0%
food while attending public schools
 
07:09:06.430 --> 07:09:06.440 align:start position:0%
which is the narrower Target of this
 
07:09:09.150 --> 07:09:09.160 align:start position:0%
particular Bill an esteemed colleague
 
07:09:11.110 --> 07:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
sent an email to the finance committee
 
07:09:13.190 --> 07:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
members suggesting that we could learn
 
07:09:15.110 --> 07:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
more by hunger about hunger by
 
07:09:18.948 --> 07:09:18.958 align:start position:0%
volunteering for and 68 hours of hunger
 
07:09:20.788 --> 07:09:20.798 align:start position:0%
I took that offer I volunteered and by
 
07:09:22.270 --> 07:09:22.280 align:start position:0%
the way it's a great charity if you have
 
07:09:25.868 --> 07:09:25.878 align:start position:0%
an hour on every Wednesday uh
 
07:09:28.190 --> 07:09:28.200 align:start position:0%
evening but even that charity is
 
07:09:31.468 --> 07:09:31.478 align:start position:0%
designed to address the 68 hours when
 
07:09:34.030 --> 07:09:34.040 align:start position:0%
kids are not in school and that's
 
07:09:36.590 --> 07:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
happening because nobody that I spoke
 
07:09:38.830 --> 07:09:38.840 align:start position:0%
with there could show me one case of a
 
07:09:41.590 --> 07:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
kid being denied food in a public school
 
07:09:43.788 --> 07:09:43.798 align:start position:0%
the concern is what happens when they go
 
07:09:45.750 --> 07:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
home and their families don't have the
 
07:09:47.788 --> 07:09:47.798 align:start position:0%
resources and those are things that
 
07:09:50.468 --> 07:09:50.478 align:start position:0%
would not be addressed by this bill
 
07:09:53.230 --> 07:09:53.240 align:start position:0%
during the Senate house joint committee
 
07:09:55.788 --> 07:09:55.798 align:start position:0%
that I was also on we asked the doe for
 
07:09:57.910 --> 07:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
any information to show that kids are
 
07:10:01.070 --> 07:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
not getting fed meals in public schools
 
07:10:03.910 --> 07:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
no data so we asked them to at least
 
07:10:05.708 --> 07:10:05.718 align:start position:0%
give us some statistics and they will
 
07:10:09.310 --> 07:10:09.320 align:start position:0%
gather that on which schools are writing
 
07:10:12.110 --> 07:10:12.120 align:start position:0%
off school debt for school launches you
 
07:10:14.830 --> 07:10:14.840 align:start position:0%
know if people get fed but don't pay for
 
07:10:17.628 --> 07:10:17.638 align:start position:0%
it that has to be written off at the end
 
07:10:20.590 --> 07:10:20.600 align:start position:0%
of the year we should have some data and
 
07:10:22.590 --> 07:10:22.600 align:start position:0%
hopefully that will help a little bit
 
07:10:24.350 --> 07:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
with establishing whether this happens
 
07:10:26.270 --> 07:10:26.280 align:start position:0%
or not even though then the kids are
 
07:10:27.788 --> 07:10:27.798 align:start position:0%
still getting fed they just don't pay
 
07:10:30.150 --> 07:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
for it and the taxpayers have to
 
07:10:34.070 --> 07:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
pay now there are two reasons listed
 
07:10:36.350 --> 07:10:36.360 align:start position:0%
generally considered valid for people
 
07:10:37.868 --> 07:10:37.878 align:start position:0%
not enrolling in a program they are
 
07:10:40.190 --> 07:10:40.200 align:start position:0%
eligible for in this particular one the
 
07:10:42.750 --> 07:10:42.760 align:start position:0%
fact that the paperwork is a pain which
 
07:10:44.388 --> 07:10:44.398 align:start position:0%
frankly it
 
07:10:47.030 --> 07:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
is but the solution to that is to
 
07:10:48.910 --> 07:10:48.920 align:start position:0%
simplify the paperwork and the doe
 
07:10:50.830 --> 07:10:50.840 align:start position:0%
assured us that they will look into that
 
07:10:53.070 --> 07:10:53.080 align:start position:0%
and they will try to create a portal to
 
07:10:56.270 --> 07:10:56.280 align:start position:0%
AC to make this easier also if a person
 
07:10:58.910 --> 07:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
is already eligible for Medicaid we hope
 
07:11:00.350 --> 07:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
that they should be able to just prove
 
07:11:02.590 --> 07:11:02.600 align:start position:0%
they're eligible for Medicaid instead of
 
07:11:05.590 --> 07:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
having to prove once more that they
 
07:11:05.600 --> 07:11:07.590 align:start position:0%
having to prove once more that they
income

07:11:07.590 --> 07:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
income
 
07:11:11.510 --> 07:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
limited second parent choice a lot of
 
07:11:13.310 --> 07:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
parents choose not to let kids
 
07:11:15.750 --> 07:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
participate in this program whether they
 
07:11:18.030 --> 07:11:18.040 align:start position:0%
do it because of the well documented
 
07:11:20.190 --> 07:11:20.200 align:start position:0%
stigma of being part of this program
 
07:11:22.070 --> 07:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
kids can be really really mean to each
 
07:11:24.670 --> 07:11:24.680 align:start position:0%
other at various ages despite the best
 
07:11:26.670 --> 07:11:26.680 align:start position:0%
attempts of teachers to show them
 
07:11:29.948 --> 07:11:29.958 align:start position:0%
otherwise or for any other reasons the
 
07:11:32.270 --> 07:11:32.280 align:start position:0%
parents know better what's good for
 
07:11:34.948 --> 07:11:34.958 align:start position:0%
their kid than the state does we should
 
07:11:37.388 --> 07:11:37.398 align:start position:0%
respect that choice and I think that
 
07:11:41.750 --> 07:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
using HB 601 to have people choose
 
07:11:44.468 --> 07:11:44.478 align:start position:0%
between not applying for Medicaid or
 
07:11:46.388 --> 07:11:46.398 align:start position:0%
having their private data used to enroll
 
07:11:48.190 --> 07:11:48.200 align:start position:0%
them in a program they do not want to be
 
07:11:50.070 --> 07:11:50.080 align:start position:0%
a part of is
 
07:11:50.080 --> 07:11:51.830 align:start position:0%
a part of is
unconscionable

07:11:51.830 --> 07:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
unconscionable
 
07:11:55.110 --> 07:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
so what is the purpose of this bill well
 
07:11:57.910 --> 07:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
clearly it's to add another 190 million
 
07:11:59.868 --> 07:11:59.878 align:start position:0%
to education
 
07:12:02.230 --> 07:12:02.240 align:start position:0%
funding problem with that is that the
 
07:12:05.270 --> 07:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
budget has already been completed and in
 
07:12:06.830 --> 07:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
that budget we already increased
 
07:12:11.070 --> 07:12:11.080 align:start position:0%
education funding by $193 million let me
 
07:12:13.750 --> 07:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
be clear the time to change State
 
07:12:16.310 --> 07:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
education funding is during the budget
 
07:12:19.350 --> 07:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
process not way after that with a
 
07:12:22.230 --> 07:12:22.240 align:start position:0%
separate bill and as the finance to
 
07:12:25.468 --> 07:12:25.478 align:start position:0%
committee clerk I know firsthand that we
 
07:12:28.070 --> 07:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
already considered the fact that kids
 
07:12:30.070 --> 07:12:30.080 align:start position:0%
are eligible for free and reduced meals
 
07:12:31.708 --> 07:12:31.718 align:start position:0%
and they are not enrolled in it because
 
07:12:33.830 --> 07:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
it does affect education funding
 
07:12:35.670 --> 07:12:35.680 align:start position:0%
negatively those school districts lose
 
07:12:37.350 --> 07:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
on some education funding that they
 
07:12:38.590 --> 07:12:38.600 align:start position:0%
would otherwise
 
07:12:41.230 --> 07:12:41.240 align:start position:0%
need and we did our best to allocate
 
07:12:44.150 --> 07:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
funds to compensate for that and again
 
07:12:45.910 --> 07:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
that was part of the reason why the
 
07:12:48.830 --> 07:12:48.840 align:start position:0%
increase in the education budget was so
 
07:12:51.468 --> 07:12:51.478 align:start position:0%
high given that we already already done
 
07:12:53.270 --> 07:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
the best we could and we used all funds
 
07:12:54.990 --> 07:12:55.000 align:start position:0%
that we could wisely use asking for
 
07:12:57.110 --> 07:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
another 190 Millions is the very
 
07:12:59.670 --> 07:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
definition of fiscally responsibility
 
07:13:03.190 --> 07:13:03.200 align:start position:0%
making HB 601 impossible to justify
 
07:13:06.270 --> 07:13:06.280 align:start position:0%
Frankly Speaking for myself the fact
 
07:13:11.270 --> 07:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
that our current education formula adds
 
07:13:14.708 --> 07:13:14.718 align:start position:0%
125,000 in education funding a year for
 
07:13:16.990 --> 07:13:17.000 align:start position:0%
every kid that is in the free and clear
 
07:13:20.030 --> 07:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
free and reduced meal program shows that
 
07:13:22.030 --> 07:13:22.040 align:start position:0%
the education for formula is broken and
 
07:13:23.868 --> 07:13:23.878 align:start position:0%
we really got to focus on fixing the
 
07:13:27.590 --> 07:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
darn thing next year because this is not
 
07:13:31.190 --> 07:13:31.200 align:start position:0%
justifiable one last fact during the
 
07:13:33.030 --> 07:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
committee work session on this bill I
 
07:13:35.270 --> 07:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
asked New Hampshire hunger Solutions who
 
07:13:37.468 --> 07:13:37.478 align:start position:0%
were advocating for this bill if they
 
07:13:40.070 --> 07:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
have any information on any kids being
 
07:13:42.468 --> 07:13:42.478 align:start position:0%
denied food while attending Public
 
07:13:45.150 --> 07:13:45.160 align:start position:0%
Schools they stated on the record that
 
07:13:47.070 --> 07:13:47.080 align:start position:0%
they have no such
 
07:13:49.590 --> 07:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
information if the very Organization

Speaker Mr Speaker if I know that there
 
07:16:56.750 --> 07:16:56.760 align:start position:0%
was significant support for this bill
 
07:16:58.350 --> 07:16:58.360 align:start position:0%
when it originally passed out of the
 
07:16:59.948 --> 07:16:59.958 align:start position:0%
house with a strong recommendation of
 
07:17:00.948 --> 07:17:00.958 align:start position:0%
ought to
 
07:17:03.670 --> 07:17:03.680 align:start position:0%
pass if I know the exaggerated concerns
 
07:17:05.110 --> 07:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
about the funding issues have been
 
07:17:05.120 --> 07:17:06.310 align:start position:0%
about the funding issues have been
adequately

07:17:06.310 --> 07:17:06.320 align:start position:0%
adequately
 
07:17:08.150 --> 07:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
addressed if I know that there are
 
07:17:09.948 --> 07:17:09.958 align:start position:0%
several thousands of students who would
 
07:17:11.670 --> 07:17:11.680 align:start position:0%
be who would be eligible for free and
 
07:17:14.830 --> 07:17:14.840 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch with this program who are
 
07:17:16.948 --> 07:17:16.958 align:start position:0%
not now enrolled in the current program
 
07:17:19.190 --> 07:17:19.200 align:start position:0%
for many assorted reasons and if I
 
07:17:21.190 --> 07:17:21.200 align:start position:0%
believe we have a responsibil ability to
 
07:17:24.350 --> 07:17:24.360 align:start position:0%
address childhood hunger what I now
 
07:17:27.548 --> 07:17:27.558 align:start position:0%
press the red button to oppose this itl
 
07:17:30.350 --> 07:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
in order to entertain another motion
 
07:17:32.590 --> 07:17:32.600 align:start position:0%
which would allow the state to initially
 
07:17:35.270 --> 07:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
apply to participate in a program that
 
07:17:37.750 --> 07:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
would provide in some cases the only
 
07:17:40.110 --> 07:17:40.120 align:start position:0%
breakfasts and lunches that some
 
07:17:43.310 --> 07:17:43.320 align:start position:0%
children will have thank you Mr

inquiry

07:17:51.628 --> 07:17:51.638 align:start position:0%
inquiry
 
07:17:54.548 --> 07:17:54.558 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker if I know that the
 
07:17:57.310 --> 07:17:57.320 align:start position:0%
program for free and reduced meals at
 
07:17:59.750 --> 07:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
schools is frequently used where the
 
07:18:01.628 --> 07:18:01.638 align:start position:0%
student part includes a high percentage
 
07:18:04.270 --> 07:18:04.280 align:start position:0%
of this group and they Grant further
 
07:18:08.628 --> 07:18:08.638 align:start position:0%
funds none of which go for more meals
 
07:18:10.948 --> 07:18:10.958 align:start position:0%
just goes just whatever they want to do
 
07:18:13.628 --> 07:18:13.638 align:start position:0%
with it the Medicaid Program for
 
07:18:16.510 --> 07:18:16.520 align:start position:0%
children is a separate program it's in a
 
07:18:19.388 --> 07:18:19.398 align:start position:0%
separate agency these agencies don't
 
07:18:21.868 --> 07:18:21.878 align:start position:0%
talk to each other the parents may have
 
07:18:23.628 --> 07:18:23.638 align:start position:0%
different reasons for not for being
 
07:18:26.070 --> 07:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
involved in one and not the other this
 
07:18:27.628 --> 07:18:27.638 align:start position:0%
would be a
 
07:18:31.190 --> 07:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
tremendous slush fund going to schools
 
07:18:34.430 --> 07:18:34.440 align:start position:0%
that really has nothing scheduled for it
 
07:18:38.590 --> 07:18:38.600 align:start position:0%
and as I say will be in order and
 
07:18:40.150 --> 07:18:40.160 align:start position:0%
representative wer you're going to ask
 
07:18:42.788 --> 07:18:42.798 align:start position:0%

07:18:46.590 --> 07:18:46.600 align:start position:0%
used with the the free and reduced meals
 
07:18:50.788 --> 07:18:50.798 align:start position:0%
identity it does not pay for more meals
 
07:19:00.270 --> 07:19:00.280 align:start position:0%

in opposition to the itl motion the bill
 
07:21:49.430 --> 07:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
in its current form needs further
 
07:21:52.350 --> 07:21:52.360 align:start position:0%
discussion but remains a critical
 
07:21:55.590 --> 07:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
priority for our state New Hampshire is
 
07:21:58.270 --> 07:21:58.280 align:start position:0%
one of only six states that do not

some form of mixed delivery system for

our three and four-year-old children HB
 
07:22:09.350 --> 07:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
620 establishes a division of early
 
07:22:11.388 --> 07:22:11.398 align:start position:0%
learning and the bill requires the
 
07:22:13.510 --> 07:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
director of The Early Learning to design
 
07:22:15.788 --> 07:22:15.798 align:start position:0%

level of interest in further developing
 
07:22:41.468 --> 07:22:41.478 align:start position:0%
this program in fact HB 620 needs more
 
07:22:45.708 --> 07:22:45.718 align:start position:0%
study I respectfully ask that the itl be
 
07:22:48.150 --> 07:22:48.160 align:start position:0%
overturned so that a motion of interim
 
07:22:50.670 --> 07:22:50.680 align:start position:0%
study can be made to continue this
 
07:22:52.350 --> 07:22:52.360 align:start position:0%

report thank you Mr
 
07:23:17.350 --> 07:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
Speaker the concept of a pilot program I
 
07:23:20.150 --> 07:23:20.160 align:start position:0%
think has already been taken up for pre
 
07:23:23.350 --> 07:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
pre kindergarten children in
 
07:23:25.750 --> 07:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
1965 the federal government set up a
 
07:23:28.708 --> 07:23:28.718 align:start position:0%
program called Head Start Head Start was
 
07:23:30.628 --> 07:23:30.638 align:start position:0%
for children up to age
 
07:23:32.948 --> 07:23:32.958 align:start position:0%
five and
 
07:23:36.750 --> 07:23:36.760 align:start position:0%
uh oh closer to the mic oh my gosh is
 
07:23:39.388 --> 07:23:39.398 align:start position:0%
that better
 
07:23:42.830 --> 07:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
oh now I can hear it okay do I me to
 
07:23:44.110 --> 07:23:44.120 align:start position:0%
start from the beginning or are we all
 
07:23:48.910 --> 07:23:48.920 align:start position:0%
set all right all right all right so we
 
07:23:51.190 --> 07:23:51.200 align:start position:0%
had a program this started in
 
07:23:55.430 --> 07:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
1965 and as of last year if you go to
 
07:23:58.190 --> 07:23:58.200 align:start position:0%
the Head Start website it said
 
07:24:00.910 --> 07:24:00.920 align:start position:0%
educationally it didn't have any value
 
07:24:02.430 --> 07:24:02.440 align:start position:0%
it didn't make a bit of difference to
 
07:24:04.670 --> 07:24:04.680 align:start position:0%
the the kids that were in the program
 
07:24:06.868 --> 07:24:06.878 align:start position:0%
from when they started kindergarten so
 
07:24:10.070 --> 07:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
educationally it was it was a bomb
 
07:24:13.750 --> 07:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
however if you go to Head Starts website
 
07:24:18.308 --> 07:24:18.318 align:start position:0%
today it was updated in June
 
07:24:22.468 --> 07:24:22.478 align:start position:0%
2023 now this is a social program this
 
07:24:25.230 --> 07:24:25.240 align:start position:0%
is not an educational program this is a
 
07:24:27.948 --> 07:24:27.958 align:start position:0%
program that promotes learning of
 
07:24:30.788 --> 07:24:30.798 align:start position:0%
discipline for kids and for their
 
07:24:33.868 --> 07:24:33.878 align:start position:0%
parents and has social
 
07:24:36.510 --> 07:24:36.520 align:start position:0%
aspects no educational
 
07:24:41.548 --> 07:24:41.558 align:start position:0%
mention so I I'm thinking here we are
 
07:24:44.628 --> 07:24:44.638 align:start position:0%
we're going to mimic what they did cuz
 
07:24:45.830 --> 07:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
we can do it
 
07:24:48.868 --> 07:24:48.878 align:start position:0%
better we can make preschool a learning
 
07:24:50.628 --> 07:24:50.638 align:start position:0%
experience for educ
 
07:24:54.788 --> 07:24:54.798 align:start position:0%
ation now I would add that this program
 
07:24:57.548 --> 07:24:57.558 align:start position:0%
started out Head Start started out in
 
07:25:01.110 --> 07:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
the uh in Economic Development it
 
07:25:04.070 --> 07:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
transitioned to Health and Human
 
07:25:07.548 --> 07:25:07.558 align:start position:0%
Services not the Department of Education
 
07:25:11.150 --> 07:25:11.160 align:start position:0%
so looking at a a test program to
 
07:25:16.030 --> 07:25:16.040 align:start position:0%
educate prek kids has already failed
 
07:25:18.110 --> 07:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
let's don't repeat the pass please
 
07:25:23.350 --> 07:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:25.150 --> 07:25:25.160 align:start position:0%
the question is on the majority
 
07:25:28.510 --> 07:25:28.520 align:start position:0%

07:25:34.350 --> 07:25:34.360 align:start position:0%
all those in favor say
 
07:25:37.308 --> 07:25:37.318 align:start position:0%

07:25:39.830 --> 07:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
had requested a roll call
 
07:25:43.190 --> 07:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
oh it turns out you've requested a roll
 
07:25:46.670 --> 07:25:46.680 align:start position:0%
call is that sufficiently
 
07:25:49.190 --> 07:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
seconded it is sufficiently seconded
 
07:26:18.788 --> 07:26:18.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:26:18.798 --> 07:26:48.708 align:start position:0%

07:26:48.708 --> 07:26:48.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:26:48.718 --> 07:26:57.030 align:start position:0%

07:27:13.468 --> 07:27:13.478 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that this bill will
 
07:27:15.308 --> 07:27:15.318 align:start position:0%
establish a division of early learning
 
07:27:17.388 --> 07:27:17.398 align:start position:0%
within the Department of Education and
 
07:27:19.270 --> 07:27:19.280 align:start position:0%
authorize the director of said division
 
07:27:22.110 --> 07:27:22.120 align:start position:0%

07:27:24.308 --> 07:27:24.318 align:start position:0%
three-year pilot program for three and
 
07:27:26.590 --> 07:27:26.600 align:start position:0%
four-year-old children that is a high
 
07:27:28.910 --> 07:27:28.920 align:start position:0%
quality communitybased and offers a
 
07:27:30.830 --> 07:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
mixed delivery model to the benefit of
 
07:27:32.830 --> 07:27:32.840 align:start position:0%
the children and families throughout the
 
07:27:35.070 --> 07:27:35.080 align:start position:0%
state and if I know that there is
 
07:27:37.150 --> 07:27:37.160 align:start position:0%
significant stakeholder interest in the
 
07:27:38.788 --> 07:27:38.798 align:start position:0%
enactment of such an early learning
 
07:27:41.868 --> 07:27:41.878 align:start position:0%

with finding high quality Early Learning
 
07:27:57.628 --> 07:27:57.638 align:start position:0%
programs across the state and if I
 
07:28:00.150 --> 07:28:00.160 align:start position:0%
further know that a vote of itl does not
 
07:28:02.150 --> 07:28:02.160 align:start position:0%
address the unanswered fiscal and
 
07:28:04.190 --> 07:28:04.200 align:start position:0%
implementation questions about this
 
07:28:06.628 --> 07:28:06.638 align:start position:0%
potential program and would be closing
 
07:28:08.868 --> 07:28:08.878 align:start position:0%
the door to an important educational
 
07:28:10.910 --> 07:28:10.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity for New Hampshire's youngest
 
07:28:14.190 --> 07:28:14.200 align:start position:0%
Learners putting us alongside a minority
 
07:28:16.628 --> 07:28:16.638 align:start position:0%
of five other states that have not yet
 
07:28:19.230 --> 07:28:19.240 align:start position:0%
prioritized early public learning
 
07:28:21.708 --> 07:28:21.718 align:start position:0%
programs s then would I now press the
 
07:28:24.270 --> 07:28:24.280 align:start position:0%
red button and vote no against the itl
 
07:28:26.708 --> 07:28:26.718 align:start position:0%

new extensive school program
 
07:28:51.510 --> 07:28:51.520 align:start position:0%

program that was adjudged a
 
07:28:56.270 --> 07:28:56.280 align:start position:0%

we heard debate on floor Amendment 1861
 
07:31:59.110 --> 07:31:59.120 align:start position:0%

07:32:14.948 --> 07:32:14.958 align:start position:0%
harm reduction is a spectrum of

strategies to tackle the complex and
 
07:32:21.430 --> 07:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
multifaceted drug misuse crisis choosing
 
07:32:23.788 --> 07:32:23.798 align:start position:0%
to work to minimize the harmful effects
 
07:32:27.190 --> 07:32:27.200 align:start position:0%
of drug use rather than simply ignore or
 
07:32:30.030 --> 07:32:30.040 align:start position:0%
condemn misuse has been shown to save
 
07:32:32.708 --> 07:32:32.718 align:start position:0%
lives the policy on harm reduction
 
07:32:35.990 --> 07:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
services in SB 239 is the established
 
07:32:38.468 --> 07:32:38.478 align:start position:0%
house position as we all know when a
 
07:32:40.510 --> 07:32:40.520 align:start position:0%
bill goes to a second committee it is
 
07:32:42.948 --> 07:32:42.958 align:start position:0%
not to debate the policy or a chance to
 
07:32:45.230 --> 07:32:45.240 align:start position:0%
take another bite at the Apple it was up
 
07:32:47.388 --> 07:32:47.398 align:start position:0%
to house finance to review the financial
 
07:32:50.030 --> 07:32:50.040 align:start position:0%
implications of s SP 239
 
07:32:52.510 --> 07:32:52.520 align:start position:0%
in division 3 the objections were solely
 
07:32:54.830 --> 07:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
around the policy and definitions in the
 
07:32:58.628 --> 07:32:58.638 align:start position:0%
bill not funding or cost as the state
 
07:33:01.150 --> 07:33:01.160 align:start position:0%
sees the number of overdoses rising to
 
07:33:03.750 --> 07:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
near Peak levels a more expansive
 
07:33:06.510 --> 07:33:06.520 align:start position:0%
approach to combat the opioid and
 
07:33:09.430 --> 07:33:09.440 align:start position:0%
substance misuse crisis is required and
 
07:33:13.708 --> 07:33:13.718 align:start position:0%
S SP 239 does just that if this bill is
 
07:33:17.990 --> 07:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
signed into law one thing is clear lives
 
07:33:20.548 --> 07:33:20.558 align:start position:0%
will be saved
 
07:33:22.788 --> 07:33:22.798 align:start position:0%
alternatively politely killing the bill
 
07:33:25.270 --> 07:33:25.280 align:start position:0%
through interim study will only delay
 
07:33:27.628 --> 07:33:27.638 align:start position:0%
the good that this bill can do and will
 
07:33:30.670 --> 07:33:30.680 align:start position:0%
lead to more senseless deaths I urge you
 
07:33:33.230 --> 07:33:33.240 align:start position:0%
to join me in voting no on the motion of
 
07:33:35.708 --> 07:33:35.718 align:start position:0%
interim study so another motion can be
 
07:33:38.270 --> 07:33:38.280 align:start position:0%
made and I ask for a division vote thank
 
07:33:41.350 --> 07:33:41.360 align:start position:0%

07:34:25.350 --> 07:34:25.360 align:start position:0%
Ed
 
07:34:27.548 --> 07:34:27.558 align:start position:0%
speak chair recognized representative
 
07:34:32.030 --> 07:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:34:35.270 --> 07:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
report thank you Mr Speaker
 
07:34:38.150 --> 07:34:38.160 align:start position:0%
um many people would know that I've been
 
07:34:40.910 --> 07:34:40.920 align:start position:0%
out of the net since July with a series
 
07:34:42.868 --> 07:34:42.878 align:start position:0%
of medical issues and I have missed a
 
07:34:46.230 --> 07:34:46.240 align:start position:0%
lot of the debate in division 3 but I
 
07:34:49.308 --> 07:34:49.318 align:start position:0%
have not um let go of this bill since it
 
07:34:52.510 --> 07:34:52.520 align:start position:0%
came to division 3 uh some things that
 
07:34:56.670 --> 07:34:56.680 align:start position:0%
became very obvious that I I believe is
 
07:34:58.868 --> 07:34:58.878 align:start position:0%
represented in the committee
 
07:35:01.910 --> 07:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
recommendation is that this bill
 
07:35:05.150 --> 07:35:05.160 align:start position:0%
requires further study and let me give
 
07:35:07.628 --> 07:35:07.638 align:start position:0%
you some examples the prime sponsor of
 
07:35:11.110 --> 07:35:11.120 align:start position:0%
the House of the of the of the of this
 
07:35:14.468 --> 07:35:14.478 align:start position:0%
bill um ended up uh coming and working
 
07:35:17.150 --> 07:35:17.160 align:start position:0%
with us as well as some representatives
 
07:35:22.030 --> 07:35:22.040 align:start position:0%
from HHS and and the division three and
 
07:35:24.868 --> 07:35:24.878 align:start position:0%
uh a couple of things that we
 
07:35:28.070 --> 07:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
identified uh after that in
 
07:35:30.230 --> 07:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
conversations that I could attend
 
07:35:35.308 --> 07:35:35.318 align:start position:0%
because I was down uh was that uh the
 
07:35:38.750 --> 07:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
definition of harm reduction is really
 
07:35:42.308 --> 07:35:42.318 align:start position:0%
Broad and flexible and it's and it's so
 
07:35:44.948 --> 07:35:44.958 align:start position:0%
vague that the things that it could do
 
07:35:48.430 --> 07:35:48.440 align:start position:0%
are unbounded now the definition of harm
 
07:35:48.440 --> 07:35:49.670 align:start position:0%
are unbounded now the definition of harm
reduction

07:35:49.670 --> 07:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
reduction
 
07:35:51.868 --> 07:35:51.878 align:start position:0%
got added to this bill that we did vote
 
07:35:54.150 --> 07:35:54.160 align:start position:0%
on in the house and pasted by a
 
07:35:56.990 --> 07:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
physician who has worked years in this
 
07:36:00.110 --> 07:36:00.120 align:start position:0%
area um and so he added the harm
 
07:36:02.070 --> 07:36:02.080 align:start position:0%
reduction definition knowing that it was
 
07:36:06.070 --> 07:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
needed well it was necessary but not
 
07:36:08.948 --> 07:36:08.958 align:start position:0%
sufficient because one of the issues
 
07:36:12.670 --> 07:36:12.680 align:start position:0%
that are being had around the nation as
 
07:36:16.708 --> 07:36:16.718 align:start position:0%
harm reduction is is is used as a shield
 
07:36:18.990 --> 07:36:19.000 align:start position:0%
to prevent Common Sense from interfering
 
07:36:23.670 --> 07:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
ing um they are implementing things like
 
07:36:27.548 --> 07:36:27.558 align:start position:0%
safe needle exchanges uh safe injection
 
07:36:30.948 --> 07:36:30.958 align:start position:0%
sites uh New York City installed vending
 
07:36:34.388 --> 07:36:34.398 align:start position:0%
machines that offered free crack pipes
 
07:36:37.830 --> 07:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
um uh in uh in one of the West Coast
 
07:36:39.308 --> 07:36:39.318 align:start position:0%
cities whether it was Seattle or
 
07:36:42.388 --> 07:36:42.398 align:start position:0%
Portland it slips my mind uh they had an
 
07:36:44.708 --> 07:36:44.718 align:start position:0%
initiative called harm reduction where
 
07:36:46.990 --> 07:36:47.000 align:start position:0%
they thought it would reduce the harm to
 
07:36:49.350 --> 07:36:49.360 align:start position:0%
individuals if the government provided
 
07:36:50.670 --> 07:36:50.680 align:start position:0%
them with a
 
07:36:54.910 --> 07:36:54.920 align:start position:0%
house all right so so the boundaries on
 
07:36:58.110 --> 07:36:58.120 align:start position:0%
this are just unlimited uh in in I think
 
07:37:02.190 --> 07:37:02.200 align:start position:0%
it was in Seattle the uh businesses said
 
07:37:05.110 --> 07:37:05.120 align:start position:0%
the problem with people uh congregating
 
07:37:07.910 --> 07:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
on our streets is so massive it's
 
07:37:10.708 --> 07:37:10.718 align:start position:0%
driving around it's driving off Street
 
07:37:12.868 --> 07:37:12.878 align:start position:0%
traffic and you're killing our
 
07:37:15.510 --> 07:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
businesses so the city of Seattle
 
07:37:18.070 --> 07:37:18.080 align:start position:0%
relented after 2 three years and started
 
07:37:22.230 --> 07:37:22.240 align:start position:0%
to move the the um the vagrance off of
 
07:37:25.948 --> 07:37:25.958 align:start position:0%
the business Corridor somewhere else and
 
07:37:28.388 --> 07:37:28.398 align:start position:0%
the harm reduction Coalition of that
 
07:37:32.030 --> 07:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
area came out and sued them because they
 
07:37:36.190 --> 07:37:36.200 align:start position:0%
said if you force a movement of a
 
07:37:39.110 --> 07:37:39.120 align:start position:0%
homeless person that is by definition
 
07:37:42.590 --> 07:37:42.600 align:start position:0%
doing more harm and u a member will
 
07:37:45.030 --> 07:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
suspend for a minute so this this been
 
07:37:47.548 --> 07:37:47.558 align:start position:0%
to the policy committee and now it's in
 
07:37:51.868 --> 07:37:51.878 align:start position:0%
finance yes I'm to it okay but okay so
 
07:37:54.070 --> 07:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
this is a this is an often confused
 
07:37:55.868 --> 07:37:55.878 align:start position:0%
point I think that one of the
 
07:37:58.510 --> 07:37:58.520 align:start position:0%
obligations of Finance is to take a look
 
07:38:00.910 --> 07:38:00.920 align:start position:0%
to see if we're doing a program that's
 
07:38:02.830 --> 07:38:02.840 align:start position:0%
sustainable and supportable over the
 
07:38:05.468 --> 07:38:05.478 align:start position:0%
long term and that certainly includes
 
07:38:08.788 --> 07:38:08.798 align:start position:0%
fiscal accountability and responsibility
 
07:38:11.468 --> 07:38:11.478 align:start position:0%
and I've just described how this
 
07:38:14.270 --> 07:38:14.280 align:start position:0%
particular definition of harm reduction
 
07:38:18.350 --> 07:38:18.360 align:start position:0%
can be so abused that it's no longer a
 
07:38:21.030 --> 07:38:21.040 align:start position:0%
FIS Ally responsible thing we've sort of
 
07:38:23.468 --> 07:38:23.478 align:start position:0%
all reached this level of consensus that
 
07:38:26.708 --> 07:38:26.718 align:start position:0%
safe needle exchanges make sense but we
 
07:38:29.388 --> 07:38:29.398 align:start position:0%
haven't debated all the other things so
 
07:38:32.468 --> 07:38:32.478 align:start position:0%
what uh what we've agreed to do is to
 
07:38:36.150 --> 07:38:36.160 align:start position:0%
take this bill uh and one of the members
 
07:38:38.430 --> 07:38:38.440 align:start position:0%
of the other house that had been a key
 
07:38:41.270 --> 07:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the harm reduction bill is
 
07:38:45.270 --> 07:38:45.280 align:start position:0%
introducing uh a late Bill to the Senate
 
07:38:49.510 --> 07:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
to the other people um saying that
 
07:38:52.788 --> 07:38:52.798 align:start position:0%
uh we want to create a counterveiling
 
07:38:55.430 --> 07:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
weight so that it isn't just looking at
 
07:38:58.628 --> 07:38:58.638 align:start position:0%
harm reduction in the in the micro
 
07:39:02.910 --> 07:39:02.920 align:start position:0%
sphere this is called systems um systems
 
07:39:06.750 --> 07:39:06.760 align:start position:0%
uh um subsystem optimization where you
 
07:39:09.788 --> 07:39:09.798 align:start position:0%
can optimize a subsystem and do harm to
 
07:39:12.150 --> 07:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
the overall system so what we wanted to
 
07:39:12.160 --> 07:39:13.590 align:start position:0%
the overall system so what we wanted to
do

07:39:13.590 --> 07:39:13.600 align:start position:0%
do
 
07:39:15.468 --> 07:39:15.478 align:start position:0%
representative we got to get to the
 
07:39:18.468 --> 07:39:18.478 align:start position:0%
fiscal bit of this I I'm really having a
 
07:39:18.478 --> 07:39:19.388 align:start position:0%
fiscal bit of this I I'm really having a
hard

07:39:19.388 --> 07:39:19.398 align:start position:0%
hard
 
07:39:21.230 --> 07:39:21.240 align:start position:0%
we have to get to the fiscal part of
 
07:39:24.308 --> 07:39:24.318 align:start position:0%
this okay I think we have but I I will
 
07:39:26.190 --> 07:39:26.200 align:start position:0%
defer to your judgment on that I I
 
07:39:28.308 --> 07:39:28.318 align:start position:0%
disagree with it but I I I'll do what
 
07:39:31.350 --> 07:39:31.360 align:start position:0%
you're saying um all right so other than
 
07:39:34.868 --> 07:39:34.878 align:start position:0%
the sustainability thing what has been
 
07:39:39.510 --> 07:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
highlighted in uh this effort is that
 
07:39:41.510 --> 07:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
the money that's going to start getting
 
07:39:45.948 --> 07:39:45.958 align:start position:0%
spent for harm harm reduction uh is is
 
07:39:48.670 --> 07:39:48.680 align:start position:0%
going to be done by things like the
 
07:39:50.708 --> 07:39:50.718 align:start position:0%
opioid abatement committee and by the
 
07:39:52.468 --> 07:39:52.478 align:start position:0%
governor's Commission on alcohol and
 
07:39:54.468 --> 07:39:54.478 align:start position:0%
drug abuse neither of which are
 
07:39:57.150 --> 07:39:57.160 align:start position:0%
legislative bodies and so the decisions
 
07:39:59.830 --> 07:39:59.840 align:start position:0%
that they might make are not subject to
 
07:40:02.350 --> 07:40:02.360 align:start position:0%
the review of the legislature what
 
07:40:05.030 --> 07:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
happens is they put together a program
 
07:40:07.948 --> 07:40:07.958 align:start position:0%
and in that program they spend money and
 
07:40:10.388 --> 07:40:10.398 align:start position:0%
then they go to the uh executive counsel
 
07:40:12.830 --> 07:40:12.840 align:start position:0%
and the executive counsel approves each
 
07:40:15.548 --> 07:40:15.558 align:start position:0%
program nobody reviews the budget they
 
07:40:17.750 --> 07:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
review the whether or not to approve the
 
07:40:21.628 --> 07:40:21.638 align:start position:0%
contract and so if you are like me and
 
07:40:24.030 --> 07:40:24.040 align:start position:0%
you think that the power of the purse is
 
07:40:27.190 --> 07:40:27.200 align:start position:0%
an essential power of the legislature
 
07:40:28.948 --> 07:40:28.958 align:start position:0%
you would recognize that the way this
 
07:40:32.110 --> 07:40:32.120 align:start position:0%
has been set up is is is a bit
 
07:40:35.670 --> 07:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional and um Patrick tus of
 
07:40:38.150 --> 07:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
the governor's commission agrees that we
 
07:40:40.670 --> 07:40:40.680 align:start position:0%
ought to take a look at what it would
 
07:40:42.948 --> 07:40:42.958 align:start position:0%
what we would do to make sure that there
 
07:40:44.788 --> 07:40:44.798 align:start position:0%
is some legislative oversight and
 
07:40:47.070 --> 07:40:47.080 align:start position:0%
approval in the in the budget process
 
07:40:49.430 --> 07:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
which I think is extremely reasonable if
 
07:40:51.548 --> 07:40:51.558 align:start position:0%
you believe in the Constitution so for
 
07:40:55.110 --> 07:40:55.120 align:start position:0%
those two reasons um interim study is
 
07:40:56.948 --> 07:40:56.958 align:start position:0%
appropriate and we're going to have our
 
07:40:59.070 --> 07:40:59.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity because the senator has
 
07:41:01.788 --> 07:41:01.798 align:start position:0%
promised to bring forth a bill in the
 
07:41:04.868 --> 07:41:04.878 align:start position:0%
Senate that would identify uh these two
 
07:41:07.990 --> 07:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
issues for further discussion and um and
 
07:41:12.670 --> 07:41:12.680 align:start position:0%
so I I ask you to support the committee
 
07:41:16.150 --> 07:41:16.160 align:start position:0%
recommendation on on interim study
 
07:41:17.830 --> 07:41:17.840 align:start position:0%
because this bill does need interim
 
07:41:20.308 --> 07:41:20.318 align:start position:0%
study it does need interim study and
 
07:41:23.308 --> 07:41:23.318 align:start position:0%
it's not like any of us want it to go
 
07:41:25.430 --> 07:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
away it's just that we want to have it
 
07:41:27.548 --> 07:41:27.558 align:start position:0%
sustainable and constitutional and
 
07:41:29.830 --> 07:41:29.840 align:start position:0%
subject to sort of public scrutiny and
 
07:41:33.350 --> 07:41:33.360 align:start position:0%
not not just u a horse run wild so I'm
 
07:41:34.750 --> 07:41:34.760 align:start position:0%
going to ask you to support the
 
07:41:34.760 --> 07:41:38.510 align:start position:0%
going to ask you to support the
committee

07:41:38.510 --> 07:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:41:41.150 --> 07:41:41.160 align:start position:0%
report there has been a request for a
 
07:41:43.110 --> 07:41:43.120 align:start position:0%
division vote this will be a division
 
07:41:47.350 --> 07:41:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:41:47.360 --> 07:42:17.350 align:start position:0%
 
seats

07:42:17.350 --> 07:42:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:42:17.360 --> 07:42:39.948 align:start position:0%
 
represent

07:42:39.948 --> 07:42:39.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:42:41.948 --> 07:42:41.958 align:start position:0%
the questions on the majority committee
 
07:42:45.468 --> 07:42:45.478 align:start position:0%
report of interim study and this is a
 
07:42:45.478 --> 07:42:47.270 align:start position:0%
report of interim study and this is a
division

07:42:47.270 --> 07:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
division
 
07:42:49.308 --> 07:42:49.318 align:start position:0%
vote representative Stringham is
 
07:42:53.750 --> 07:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:42:56.110 --> 07:42:56.120 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr
 
07:42:59.990 --> 07:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that Senate Bill 239
 
07:43:02.150 --> 07:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
adds harm reduction services to the
 
07:43:04.468 --> 07:43:04.478 align:start position:0%
scope of the governor's Commission on

treatment and Recovery a needed addition
 
07:43:12.830 --> 07:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
to the program and if I know that this
 
07:43:15.948 --> 07:43:15.958 align:start position:0%
life-saving bill passed this body on a
 
07:43:19.070 --> 07:43:19.080 align:start position:0%
Voice vote after a diligent effort led
 
07:43:22.468 --> 07:43:22.478 align:start position:0%
to the passage of a floor Amendment with
 
07:43:26.670 --> 07:43:26.680 align:start position:0%
359 bipartisan votes when concerns about
 
07:43:28.350 --> 07:43:28.360 align:start position:0%
the definition of harm reduction
 
07:43:32.030 --> 07:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
Services were addressed by a physician
 
07:43:34.230 --> 07:43:34.240 align:start position:0%
uh and colleagues with years of
 
07:43:35.628 --> 07:43:35.638 align:start position:0%
experience in the
 
07:43:38.868 --> 07:43:38.878 align:start position:0%
field and if I know that after passing
 
07:43:41.388 --> 07:43:41.398 align:start position:0%
this bill it went to finance for a
 
07:43:44.788 --> 07:43:44.798 align:start position:0%
review of the budgetary impacts and if I
 
07:43:46.548 --> 07:43:46.558 align:start position:0%
know that there are no costs with this
 
07:43:49.150 --> 07:43:49.160 align:start position:0%
bill and the only concerns are policy
 
07:43:51.150 --> 07:43:51.160 align:start position:0%
that were thoroughly discussed before
 
07:43:53.910 --> 07:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
being passed would I then press the red
 
07:43:56.190 --> 07:43:56.200 align:start position:0%
button so that another motion can be
 
07:43:57.910 --> 07:43:57.920 align:start position:0%

07:44:09.070 --> 07:44:09.080 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
07:44:12.910 --> 07:44:12.920 align:start position:0%
that the primary task of a legislature
 
07:44:16.468 --> 07:44:16.478 align:start position:0%
is to set clear and well-defined limits
 
07:44:20.510 --> 07:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:44:22.510 --> 07:44:22.520 align:start position:0%
and I know if lacking that language the
 
07:44:25.350 --> 07:44:25.360 align:start position:0%
bill becomes ineffective subject to
 
07:44:25.360 --> 07:44:26.270 align:start position:0%
bill becomes ineffective subject to
constant

07:44:26.270 --> 07:44:26.280 align:start position:0%

Deerfield thank you Mr Speaker it's the
 
07:49:03.750 --> 07:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
feel-good story of the year for for
 
07:49:06.708 --> 07:49:06.718 align:start position:0%
myself and a lot of my
 
07:49:10.030 --> 07:49:10.040 align:start position:0%
constituents so Deerfield has sent all
 
07:49:12.190 --> 07:49:12.200 align:start position:0%
of our high school students uh to
 
07:49:14.750 --> 07:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
conquered high school for the last 20
 
07:49:14.760 --> 07:49:16.510 align:start position:0%
conquered high school for the last 20
years

07:49:16.510 --> 07:49:16.520 align:start position:0%
years
 
07:49:19.110 --> 07:49:19.120 align:start position:0%
and that was an original 10-year
 
07:49:21.388 --> 07:49:21.398 align:start position:0%
contract and then 10 years ago we reup
 
07:49:23.548 --> 07:49:23.558 align:start position:0%
for another 10 years and there was some
 
07:49:27.070 --> 07:49:27.080 align:start position:0%
discontent about the the second
 
07:49:29.750 --> 07:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
extension people wanted expanded school
 
07:49:32.468 --> 07:49:32.478 align:start position:0%
choice and so for 10 years this has been
 
07:49:35.230 --> 07:49:35.240 align:start position:0%
percolating in Deerfield last year we
 
07:49:37.510 --> 07:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
were presented an unprecedented 133-year
 
07:49:39.948 --> 07:49:39.958 align:start position:0%
contract with conquer which is a fine
 
07:49:42.308 --> 07:49:42.318 align:start position:0%
school right down the road I have I have
 
07:49:43.948 --> 07:49:43.958 align:start position:0%
all all the respect for conquered high
 
07:49:45.990 --> 07:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
school for sure but it was clear that
 
07:49:48.468 --> 07:49:48.478 align:start position:0%
Deerfield families wanted choice and
 
07:49:51.270 --> 07:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
they voted that contract
 
07:49:55.510 --> 07:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
down and our school board listened we we
 
07:49:58.150 --> 07:49:58.160 align:start position:0%
elected a new majority and they listened
 
07:50:01.070 --> 07:50:01.080 align:start position:0%
to the voters and now instead of sending
 
07:50:04.548 --> 07:50:04.558 align:start position:0%
all of our kids to one public school we
 
07:50:07.030 --> 07:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
now have the choice of three Public
 
07:50:09.468 --> 07:50:09.478 align:start position:0%
Schools three public schools and what's
 
07:50:12.750 --> 07:50:12.760 align:start position:0%
interesting about that is more than half
 
07:50:15.190 --> 07:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
of our current eighth graders have
 
07:50:18.590 --> 07:50:18.600 align:start position:0%
chosen one of the other schools
 
07:50:20.670 --> 07:50:20.680 align:start position:0%
and and I don't mean one out of the two
 
07:50:22.830 --> 07:50:22.840 align:start position:0%
other Schools they're all going to to
 
07:50:28.670 --> 07:50:28.680 align:start position:0%
one and and so it one size fits all is
 
07:50:31.150 --> 07:50:31.160 align:start position:0%
an impossibility right and and for
 
07:50:33.308 --> 07:50:33.318 align:start position:0%
someone like me it's not perfect I'm a
 
07:50:35.830 --> 07:50:35.840 align:start position:0%
universal school choice guy but we
 
07:50:38.708 --> 07:50:38.718 align:start position:0%
expanded options to other public schools
 
07:50:41.030 --> 07:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
and it's helped families interesting
 
07:50:43.190 --> 07:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
side effect people want to tell us right
 
07:50:46.030 --> 07:50:46.040 align:start position:0%
the school choice makes kids flee the
 
07:50:47.628 --> 07:50:47.638 align:start position:0%
public school system if we have a
 
07:50:50.070 --> 07:50:50.080 align:start position:0%
expanded school choice the the the kids
 
07:50:54.350 --> 07:50:54.360 align:start position:0%
run away our high school population
 
07:50:57.308 --> 07:50:57.318 align:start position:0%
Public School High School population has
 
07:50:59.788 --> 07:50:59.798 align:start position:0%
increased this year
 
07:51:02.590 --> 07:51:02.600 align:start position:0%
unexpectedly because families are
 
07:51:05.948 --> 07:51:05.958 align:start position:0%
choosing to put their children back into
 
07:51:08.750 --> 07:51:08.760 align:start position:0%
the public school system because there
 
07:51:12.030 --> 07:51:12.040 align:start position:0%
were more options and I tell you this
 
07:51:13.990 --> 07:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
because we hear about pop School
 
07:51:16.548 --> 07:51:16.558 align:start position:0%
populations Public School populations
 
07:51:19.230 --> 07:51:19.240 align:start position:0%
declining and if your district has
 
07:51:21.388 --> 07:51:21.398 align:start position:0%
declining student
 
07:51:24.830 --> 07:51:24.840 align:start position:0%
populations look to Deerfield as a a
 
07:51:28.150 --> 07:51:28.160 align:start position:0%
potential ray of light that if you allow
 
07:51:30.868 --> 07:51:30.878 align:start position:0%
children from other districts to choose
 
07:51:33.110 --> 07:51:33.120 align:start position:0%
to come to your local public schools you
 
07:51:35.590 --> 07:51:35.600 align:start position:0%
might find your enrollment goes
 
07:51:39.868 --> 07:51:39.878 align:start position:0%
up I am glad to see Deerfield kids
 
07:51:42.388 --> 07:51:42.398 align:start position:0%
willingly happily reentering the public
 
07:51:45.190 --> 07:51:45.200 align:start position:0%
school system because they now have the
 
07:51:48.430 --> 07:51:48.440 align:start position:0%
option at least one option one choice

disposed of in the consent calendar
 
07:55:02.230 --> 07:55:02.240 align:start position:0%
because they were included in the budget
 
07:55:04.270 --> 07:55:04.280 align:start position:0%
we retained them to make sure they were
