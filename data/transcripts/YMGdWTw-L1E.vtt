00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:20.940 align:start position:0%
please recall I really don't even need
 
00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
this please recall that because we did
 
00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
not have a quorum at our last meeting
 
00:23:27.289 --> 00:23:27.299 align:start position:0%
the meeting was not adjourned we could
 
00:23:29.390 --> 00:23:29.400 align:start position:0%
not have a motion to adjourn instead we
 
00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:31.260 align:start position:0%
recessed so I'm going to call that
 
00:23:33.409 --> 00:23:33.419 align:start position:0%
meeting back into session and note that
 
00:23:36.529 --> 00:23:36.539 align:start position:0%
we do not yet have a quorum and I
 
00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
believe that representative Cannon will
 
00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:40.440 align:start position:0%
appear probably within about 30 minutes
 
00:23:42.289 --> 00:23:42.299 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping that we can have our business
 
00:23:45.289 --> 00:23:45.299 align:start position:0%
accomplished by then and send her out
 
00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
for coffee I do you have the uh a hard
 
00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
copy of the report
 
00:23:54.409 --> 00:23:54.419 align:start position:0%
in your hands please forgive me for
 
00:23:58.250 --> 00:23:58.260 align:start position:0%
a very serious Omission in the list of
 
00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:00.780 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:03.720 align:start position:0%
because they were late appointments I
 
00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
neglected to add Representatives Betty
 
00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:10.500 align:start position:0%
gay and representative Jerry Cannon I
 
00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:12.200 align:start position:0%
will fix that
 
00:24:17.149 --> 00:24:17.159 align:start position:0%
and at that point this will be my uh
 
00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:18.860 align:start position:0%
final report
 
00:24:22.789 --> 00:24:22.799 align:start position:0%
for this morning uh I would like to
 
00:24:25.909 --> 00:24:25.919 align:start position:0%
solicit a response from representative
 
00:24:25.919 --> 00:24:27.669 align:start position:0%
solicit a response from representative
Woods

00:24:27.669 --> 00:24:27.679 align:start position:0%
Woods
 
00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:31.340 align:start position:0%
he has been formative
 
00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:33.310 align:start position:0%
he has been formative
in

00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:33.320 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
reorienting this subcommittee in its
 
00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:39.780 align:start position:0%
assessment of precision I'm going to add
 
00:24:42.049 --> 00:24:42.059 align:start position:0%
a term here Precision medicine and
 
00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
biomarkers I defer to his wisdom and I'm
 
00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:48.900 align:start position:0%
very grateful for it and then I'm going
 
00:24:52.029 --> 00:24:52.039 align:start position:0%
to ask if there are further comments
 
00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:56.220 align:start position:0%
but given that we are probably not going
 
00:24:57.890 --> 00:24:57.900 align:start position:0%
to have a quarter I'm confident that we
 
00:24:57.900 --> 00:24:59.230 align:start position:0%
to have a quarter I'm confident that we
won't

00:24:59.230 --> 00:24:59.240 align:start position:0%
won't
 
00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
at that point we'll make whatever
 
00:25:05.169 --> 00:25:05.179 align:start position:0%
changes are recommended by those present
 
00:25:09.049 --> 00:25:09.059 align:start position:0%
and we will submit this to the oversight
 
00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:13.460 align:start position:0%
committee as the completion of our work
 
00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
which means not another meeting so with
 
00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:20.340 align:start position:0%
that I'm going to turn to representative
 
00:25:26.029 --> 00:25:26.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:28.440 align:start position:0%
yeah make one quick comment
 
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
um given given that uh representative
 
00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
Cannon is probably at least 30 minutes
 
00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
out and that we could wrap up before
 
00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:38.700 align:start position:0%
then should somebody kind of try to
 
00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:40.860 align:start position:0%
contact her and say hey don't bother did
 
00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:43.260 align:start position:0%
that oh okay it sounded like she was
 
00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:16.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:18.409 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:26:18.409 --> 00:26:18.419 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
um I I'll offer a few comments uh the
 
00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:25.460 align:start position:0%
debatable classification as wisdom
 
00:26:28.909 --> 00:26:28.919 align:start position:0%
remains to be seen
 
00:26:28.919 --> 00:26:29.570 align:start position:0%
remains to be seen
um

00:26:29.570 --> 00:26:29.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:31.789 --> 00:26:31.799 align:start position:0%
uh one of the things that we talked
 
00:26:31.799 --> 00:26:32.870 align:start position:0%
uh one of the things that we talked
about

00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:36.900 align:start position:0%
um is in in Precision medicine uh was
 
00:26:38.269 --> 00:26:38.279 align:start position:0%
the application of the normal medical
 
00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:41.400 align:start position:0%
process of I.E having the gold standard
 
00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:42.169 align:start position:0%
process of I.E having the gold standard
of

00:26:42.169 --> 00:26:42.179 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:26:45.529 --> 00:26:45.539 align:start position:0%
um double blind studies and having
 
00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
um a Cadre of uh participants in that
 
00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
study with a number large enough to have
 
00:26:54.049 --> 00:26:54.059 align:start position:0%
a meaningful outcome with p-values of
 
00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate Etc
 
00:26:59.330 --> 00:26:59.340 align:start position:0%
knowing that the
 
00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:00.370 align:start position:0%
knowing that the
um

00:27:00.370 --> 00:27:00.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:03.720 align:start position:0%
nature of quotes Precision or
 
00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:05.220 align:start position:0%
personalized medicine however you wanted
 
00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
to find that would not meet that gold
 
00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:10.090 align:start position:0%
to find that would not meet that gold
standard

00:27:10.090 --> 00:27:10.100 align:start position:0%
standard
 
00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:14.340 align:start position:0%
and that raised some issues as exactly
 
00:27:18.169 --> 00:27:18.179 align:start position:0%
what we as a committee might be able to
 
00:27:18.179 --> 00:27:21.669 align:start position:0%
what we as a committee might be able to
do

00:27:21.669 --> 00:27:21.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
being constrained
 
00:27:27.049 --> 00:27:27.059 align:start position:0%
with a normal scientific process which
 
00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:29.400 align:start position:0%
would not pass muster with first of all
 
00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:31.860 align:start position:0%
the medical society and certainly the
 
00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
larger scientific community
 
00:27:35.269 --> 00:27:35.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:27:39.769 --> 00:27:39.779 align:start position:0%
how to how to proceed and still uh as a
 
00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:43.500 align:start position:0%
legislative body uh be aware uh be
 
00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:47.580 align:start position:0%
advised and be an educator for not only
 
00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:49.980 align:start position:0%
the legislators but also for the public
 
00:27:52.850 --> 00:27:52.860 align:start position:0%
how could how could we possibly go
 
00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:54.590 align:start position:0%
how could how could we possibly go
forward

00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:55.690 align:start position:0%
forward
um

00:27:55.690 --> 00:27:55.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:59.269 --> 00:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
the idea of of of
 
00:28:02.769 --> 00:28:02.779 align:start position:0%
having some kind of oversight
 
00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:05.100 align:start position:0%
and awareness on the part of the
 
00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:07.620 align:start position:0%
legislature I think is critically
 
00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:10.260 align:start position:0%
important and as I pointed out in my
 
00:28:12.850 --> 00:28:12.860 align:start position:0%
comments I think in our first session
 
00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
we've been burned a couple times
 
00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:17.580 align:start position:0%
nationally and once specifically in New
 
00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:20.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I.E bone marrow transplants
 
00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
for treating breast cancer and we don't
 
00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:28.860 align:start position:0%
want to fall into that Gap again
 
00:28:31.549 --> 00:28:31.559 align:start position:0%
uh the issue came up of looking at
 
00:28:31.559 --> 00:28:33.430 align:start position:0%
uh the issue came up of looking at
biomarkers

00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
biomarkers
 
00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:37.640 align:start position:0%
as a subgroup of precision medicine
 
00:28:41.210 --> 00:28:41.220 align:start position:0%
uh well what are biomarkers biomarkers
 
00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:42.610 align:start position:0%
uh well what are biomarkers biomarkers
are

00:28:42.610 --> 00:28:42.620 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:47.640 align:start position:0%
a indicator and an individual that they
 
00:28:53.890 --> 00:28:53.900 align:start position:0%
have some element of either a defect
 
00:28:57.649 --> 00:28:57.659 align:start position:0%
generally chemically or at the molecular
 
00:28:57.659 --> 00:28:58.610 align:start position:0%
generally chemically or at the molecular
level

00:28:58.610 --> 00:28:58.620 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:29:01.789 --> 00:29:01.799 align:start position:0%
and that brings into play of one of my
 
00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:03.260 align:start position:0%
favorite topics
 
00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:07.620 align:start position:0%
nanomedicine and nanotechnology
 
00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:08.450 align:start position:0%
nanomedicine and nanotechnology
um

00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:08.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:10.370 --> 00:29:10.380 align:start position:0%
I used to have a dog and pony shows I
 
00:29:13.010 --> 00:29:13.020 align:start position:0%
did around the Northeast and nationally
 
00:29:15.850 --> 00:29:15.860 align:start position:0%
for the AMA about this and
 
00:29:19.010 --> 00:29:19.020 align:start position:0%
predicted that this would be the
 
00:29:21.769 --> 00:29:21.779 align:start position:0%
medicine of the future that was about
 
00:29:24.730 --> 00:29:24.740 align:start position:0%
gosh it's been 10 years ago now anyway
 
00:29:29.029 --> 00:29:29.039 align:start position:0%
that is very concrete science
 
00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
and the way that works is you do a study
 
00:29:39.529 --> 00:29:39.539 align:start position:0%
and you take some serum or a cell and
 
00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
you examined the molecular properties of
 
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:42.730 align:start position:0%
you examined the molecular properties of
it

00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:42.740 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:45.500 align:start position:0%
and with
 
00:29:49.370 --> 00:29:49.380 align:start position:0%
very well documented uh sort of middle
 
00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:51.720 align:start position:0%
of the road science
 
00:29:54.409 --> 00:29:54.419 align:start position:0%
and you can say with precision
 
00:29:57.130 --> 00:29:57.140 align:start position:0%
I'm throwing that word in potentially
 
00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:01.320 align:start position:0%
that in fact that person does have or
 
00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
does not have
 
00:30:05.389 --> 00:30:05.399 align:start position:0%
a particular entity
 
00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:09.240 align:start position:0%
and we're it we we do this all the time
 
00:30:12.409 --> 00:30:12.419 align:start position:0%
um probably one of the earliest was
 
00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
um I don't know States still do it but
 
00:30:17.029 --> 00:30:17.039 align:start position:0%
you still have to have a syphilis test
 
00:30:19.490 --> 00:30:19.500 align:start position:0%
to get married
 
00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:23.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:29.340 align:start position:0%
if you've had chickenpox you might get
 
00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:30.470 align:start position:0%
if you've had chickenpox you might get
shingles

00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
shingles
 
00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
and you can test to see if you have
 
00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:37.140 align:start position:0%
that's a biomarker but it's a very
 
00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:38.690 align:start position:0%
that's a biomarker but it's a very
concrete

00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:38.700 align:start position:0%
concrete
 
00:30:42.889 --> 00:30:42.899 align:start position:0%
test using just vanilla everyday middle
 
00:30:44.529 --> 00:30:44.539 align:start position:0%
of the road
 
00:30:50.090 --> 00:30:50.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:53.690 --> 00:30:53.700 align:start position:0%
with nanotechnology you can get down not
 
00:30:58.450 --> 00:30:58.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:01.320 align:start position:0%
but even farther down you can get down
 
00:31:03.289 --> 00:31:03.299 align:start position:0%
to the What's called the ATO range
 
00:31:08.350 --> 00:31:08.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:11.220 align:start position:0%
uh so you're getting close to being able
 
00:31:13.850 --> 00:31:13.860 align:start position:0%
to detect if a person has even one or
 
00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:15.720 align:start position:0%
two molecules in their system
 
00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:18.120 align:start position:0%
regarding a particular entity you can
 
00:31:20.090 --> 00:31:20.100 align:start position:0%
probably detected
 
00:31:22.669 --> 00:31:22.679 align:start position:0%
again with known science
 
00:31:24.889 --> 00:31:24.899 align:start position:0%
and with application
 
00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
and some of the early studies as an
 
00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:31.740 align:start position:0%
example was a study that in mice
 
00:31:33.549 --> 00:31:33.559 align:start position:0%
prostate cancer
 
00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
uh they generated a mouse strain and had
 
00:31:39.049 --> 00:31:39.059 align:start position:0%
prostate cancer and they were able to
 
00:31:39.059 --> 00:31:40.070 align:start position:0%
prostate cancer and they were able to
detect

00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
detect
 
00:31:43.130 --> 00:31:43.140 align:start position:0%
uh which ones were and which ones were
 
00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
none and they designed
 
00:31:48.649 --> 00:31:48.659 align:start position:0%
a particular molecule
 
00:31:51.649 --> 00:31:51.659 align:start position:0%
a nanoparticle Gotta Throw That Word in
 
00:31:53.090 --> 00:31:53.100 align:start position:0%
there again
 
00:31:55.370 --> 00:31:55.380 align:start position:0%
designed a nanoparticle that would
 
00:31:58.909 --> 00:31:58.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
and was designed in a way that it would
 
00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:06.950 align:start position:0%
and was designed in a way that it would
release

00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
release
 
00:32:11.649 --> 00:32:11.659 align:start position:0%
a particular in this case a metallic
 
00:32:14.210 --> 00:32:14.220 align:start position:0%
iron into the cell
 
00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
and then metallic they use a magnetic
 
00:32:19.669 --> 00:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
field to heat it
 
00:32:22.669 --> 00:32:22.679 align:start position:0%
like a microwave in microwave oven so to
 
00:32:26.330 --> 00:32:26.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:28.860 align:start position:0%
using standard techniques
 
00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
very well known
 
00:32:32.029 --> 00:32:32.039 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
00:32:36.049 --> 00:32:36.059 align:start position:0%
sort of the end point for biomarkers
 
00:32:40.909 --> 00:32:40.919 align:start position:0%
again you don't have you know in in a
 
00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:43.620 align:start position:0%
study double-blind study of thousands in
 
00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:44.940 align:start position:0%
your testing and you're giving a
 
00:32:47.149 --> 00:32:47.159 align:start position:0%
medication which you think may work
 
00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:49.320 align:start position:0%
you're going at the other end and saying
 
00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:52.200 align:start position:0%
we know this we can prove that this is a
 
00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
cancer cell and we know that this
 
00:32:56.450 --> 00:32:56.460 align:start position:0%
particular molecule will kill that
 
00:32:58.549 --> 00:32:58.559 align:start position:0%
cancer cell and we've designed this
 
00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:02.100 align:start position:0%
molecule to get to do just that
 
00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:04.860 align:start position:0%
now that sounds pretty straightforward
 
00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:07.140 align:start position:0%
you know just take one out of this
 
00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:09.240 align:start position:0%
bottle and put it in this bottle and
 
00:33:10.789 --> 00:33:10.799 align:start position:0%
you're all done
 
00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:12.720 align:start position:0%
but you still have there's still
 
00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:15.960 align:start position:0%
criteria that have to be followed and
 
00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:19.260 align:start position:0%
that that criteria in general form is is
 
00:33:21.889 --> 00:33:21.899 align:start position:0%
like the criteria for a medication
 
00:33:24.169 --> 00:33:24.179 align:start position:0%
you say well gee I've got this new
 
00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:28.200 align:start position:0%
medication and it works wonderfully
 
00:33:32.029 --> 00:33:32.039 align:start position:0%
uh well like I'll back up and give you
 
00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:35.580 align:start position:0%
an example of a a penicillin appearance
 
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
Allen penicillin first came on the
 
00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:39.169 align:start position:0%
Allen penicillin first came on the
market

00:33:39.169 --> 00:33:39.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:43.549 --> 00:33:43.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:46.610 --> 00:33:46.620 align:start position:0%
wow this is not good in the lab it
 
00:33:49.669 --> 00:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
killed all the organisms great
 
00:33:51.529 --> 00:33:51.539 align:start position:0%
Churchill was one of the first to get it
 
00:33:51.539 --> 00:33:52.610 align:start position:0%
Churchill was one of the first to get it
actually

00:33:52.610 --> 00:33:52.620 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
long story behind that
 
00:33:59.269 --> 00:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
but carries out they weren't allergic to
 
00:34:02.029 --> 00:34:02.039 align:start position:0%
the penicillin they were allergic to the
 
00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:04.200 align:start position:0%
molecule that the penicillin was
 
00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
attached to
 
00:34:09.829 --> 00:34:09.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
and for the FDA to pass a medication
 
00:34:17.210 --> 00:34:17.220 align:start position:0%
it has to be number one chemically pure
 
00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
in other words you can you can't just
 
00:34:22.490 --> 00:34:22.500 align:start position:0%
have it as we when you make a molecule
 
00:34:24.770 --> 00:34:24.780 align:start position:0%
in the lab he might make some other side
 
00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:25.970 align:start position:0%
in the lab he might make some other side
species

00:34:25.970 --> 00:34:25.980 align:start position:0%
species
 
00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
uh of a molecules which may not be so
 
00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:29.629 align:start position:0%
uh of a molecules which may not be so
good

00:34:29.629 --> 00:34:29.639 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:34:31.490 --> 00:34:31.500 align:start position:0%
so when you make it you got to make it
 
00:34:32.950 --> 00:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:37.020 align:start position:0%
99.99 pure so to speak as the old Ivory
 
00:34:39.169 --> 00:34:39.179 align:start position:0%
soap commercial said
 
00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:46.260 align:start position:0%
it used to be biologically compatible
 
00:34:48.470 --> 00:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
it may be pure but you put it in
 
00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
biologic system and it reacts because
 
00:34:54.349 --> 00:34:54.359 align:start position:0%
like the penicillin initially did so
 
00:34:56.690 --> 00:34:56.700 align:start position:0%
that's Criterion number two
 
00:34:58.670 --> 00:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
criteria number three
 
00:35:00.829 --> 00:35:00.839 align:start position:0%
it has to have efficacy
 
00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
it has to be able to do something once
 
00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
it gets there so it has to be pure
 
00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
has to be biologically compatible and
 
00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
then it has to do what it's supposed to
 
00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:11.450 align:start position:0%
then it has to do what it's supposed to
do

00:35:11.450 --> 00:35:11.460 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:14.540 align:start position:0%
those are the basic overall outline
 
00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:17.940 align:start position:0%
using biomarkers
 
00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:20.760 align:start position:0%
okay you still have that same make sure
 
00:35:23.210 --> 00:35:23.220 align:start position:0%
that that molecule that you're making to
 
00:35:27.170 --> 00:35:27.180 align:start position:0%
run after a specific cell and attach to
 
00:35:30.050 --> 00:35:30.060 align:start position:0%
that cell it still has to have all of
 
00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:32.540 align:start position:0%
these others so it's
 
00:35:34.730 --> 00:35:34.740 align:start position:0%
there are things that have to be
 
00:35:37.130 --> 00:35:37.140 align:start position:0%
considered but
 
00:35:39.829 --> 00:35:39.839 align:start position:0%
you don't have to have 10 000 people in
 
00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:42.900 align:start position:0%
your study to be able to do it
 
00:35:44.810 --> 00:35:44.820 align:start position:0%
and that's the difference
 
00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
and in fact we are getting medicine is
 
00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:52.040 align:start position:0%
getting more and more in that direction
 
00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
and as such after my academic
 
00:35:58.370 --> 00:35:58.380 align:start position:0%
introduction I really don't call I
 
00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:01.260 align:start position:0%
haven't gone 35 minutes yet have I yeah
 
00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:03.900 align:start position:0%
okay well I don't qualify for an
 
00:36:06.910 --> 00:36:06.920 align:start position:0%
academic introduction but
 
00:36:09.530 --> 00:36:09.540 align:start position:0%
I think that's the direction that I
 
00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
think this committee can legitimately
 
00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:14.650 align:start position:0%
think this committee can legitimately
approach

00:36:14.650 --> 00:36:14.660 align:start position:0%
approach
 
00:36:18.890 --> 00:36:18.900 align:start position:0%
the mechanism how that's done under the
 
00:36:23.710 --> 00:36:23.720 align:start position:0%
oversight committee or some other agency
 
00:36:27.650 --> 00:36:27.660 align:start position:0%
outlined I think remains but I I think
 
00:36:29.810 --> 00:36:29.820 align:start position:0%
it would be that would be the direction
 
00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:32.720 align:start position:0%
I think it would be very much
 
00:36:36.290 --> 00:36:36.300 align:start position:0%
worthwhile thank you
 
00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:38.460 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:41.940 align:start position:0%
um we do have a couple of changes to the
 
00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
draft one as I've mentioned is to add
 
00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:47.160 align:start position:0%
representative Gay's name representative
 
00:36:50.810 --> 00:36:50.820 align:start position:0%
Cannon's name we had a in the draft
 
00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
um the draft recommends that the
 
00:36:58.150 --> 00:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
oversight committee form a task force
 
00:37:02.089 --> 00:37:02.099 align:start position:0%
on emerging medical Technologies to meet
 
00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
at minimum once per year and then at the
 
00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:07.800 align:start position:0%
call of the chair
 
00:37:11.109 --> 00:37:11.119 align:start position:0%
um I did get a communication from
 
00:37:14.450 --> 00:37:14.460 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant suggesting that
 
00:37:18.290 --> 00:37:18.300 align:start position:0%
that be changed to at least twice per
 
00:37:21.290 --> 00:37:21.300 align:start position:0%
year rather than once per year and at
 
00:37:24.109 --> 00:37:24.119 align:start position:0%
the call of the chair is there any
 
00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
comment on that
 
00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:27.849 align:start position:0%
comment on that
okay

00:37:27.849 --> 00:37:27.859 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:32.280 align:start position:0%
I I think uh representative Merchants
 
00:37:34.430 --> 00:37:34.440 align:start position:0%
um observation that two times a year
 
00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:36.060 align:start position:0%
might be more appropriate is already
 
00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:37.800 align:start position:0%
covered in the language that you've
 
00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:40.440 align:start position:0%
written uh it's at least once per year
 
00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
and at the call of the chair so if the
 
00:37:44.750 --> 00:37:44.760 align:start position:0%
chair thinks their second meeting is
 
00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:46.680 align:start position:0%
needed or third meeting or a fourth
 
00:37:48.890 --> 00:37:48.900 align:start position:0%
meeting you know that that's all within
 
00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:51.780 align:start position:0%
the scope of authority of the chair so I
 
00:37:55.010 --> 00:37:55.020 align:start position:0%
I don't know that I would change what
 
00:37:57.890 --> 00:37:57.900 align:start position:0%
you've written to say two meetings I'd
 
00:38:00.410 --> 00:38:00.420 align:start position:0%
leave it at one knowing that a second
 
00:38:04.370 --> 00:38:04.380 align:start position:0%
one could be convened uh as needed
 
00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:38:09.770 --> 00:38:09.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:14.210 --> 00:38:14.220 align:start position:0%
further comments on the draft
 
00:38:17.569 --> 00:38:17.579 align:start position:0%
please go oh okay so I'm I'm looking at
 
00:38:20.690 --> 00:38:20.700 align:start position:0%
the recommendation uh section and I I
 
00:38:23.690 --> 00:38:23.700 align:start position:0%
like it I just want to point out what it
 
00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
what it says because I'm I'm gonna talk
 
00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:29.640 align:start position:0%
to the detail inside the body now in the
 
00:38:31.970 --> 00:38:31.980 align:start position:0%
middle of that recommendation there's a
 
00:38:33.829 --> 00:38:33.839 align:start position:0%
sentence the commission shall scan
 
00:38:36.770 --> 00:38:36.780 align:start position:0%
emerging medical Technologies to assess
 
00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:39.660 align:start position:0%
whether any of these Technologies Merit
 
00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:43.160 align:start position:0%
detailed oversight I love it
 
00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:49.260 align:start position:0%
on page three there's a paragraph a sub
 
00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
paragraph Alpha and Bravo and basically
 
00:38:56.089 --> 00:38:56.099 align:start position:0%
what what this paragraph is doing is
 
00:38:58.250 --> 00:38:58.260 align:start position:0%
it's identifying that we've got a need
 
00:39:00.170 --> 00:39:00.180 align:start position:0%
for this committee to look at Precision
 
00:39:04.190 --> 00:39:04.200 align:start position:0%
medicine and biomarkers it it feels to
 
00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
me like this paragraph would benefit
 
00:39:11.450 --> 00:39:11.460 align:start position:0%
from another sub-paragraph Charlie C
 
00:39:14.810 --> 00:39:14.820 align:start position:0%
that would read something like medical
 
00:39:17.930 --> 00:39:17.940 align:start position:0%
Technologies includes but is not limited
 
00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:21.720 align:start position:0%
to Precision medicine and biomarkers the
 
00:39:24.589 --> 00:39:24.599 align:start position:0%
full range of medical technology may be
 
00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
expanded include things such as
 
00:39:30.290 --> 00:39:30.300 align:start position:0%
artificial intelligence man-made organs
 
00:39:33.710 --> 00:39:33.720 align:start position:0%
for transplant emerging functional and
 
00:39:37.490 --> 00:39:37.500 align:start position:0%
structural Imaging among others so so I
 
00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
it isn't meant to be an exhaustive list
 
00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:44.220 align:start position:0%
but just an idea that we don't know what
 
00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:46.260 align:start position:0%
we don't know yet about the future of
 
00:39:49.010 --> 00:39:49.020 align:start position:0%
emerging technology and so whatever this
 
00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:52.200 align:start position:0%
committee does it should I think have a
 
00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:55.320 align:start position:0%
more open view on what may come into its
 
00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:56.569 align:start position:0%
more open view on what may come into its
purview

00:39:56.569 --> 00:39:56.579 align:start position:0%
purview
 
00:40:00.410 --> 00:40:00.420 align:start position:0%
uh thank you a couple of comments
 
00:40:02.810 --> 00:40:02.820 align:start position:0%
one can you please email me that
 
00:40:05.089 --> 00:40:05.099 align:start position:0%
verbiage I'd be very grateful for that
 
00:40:07.730 --> 00:40:07.740 align:start position:0%
okay okay secondly
 
00:40:10.130 --> 00:40:10.140 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to comment on what I think
 
00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
is a key Insight
 
00:40:16.130 --> 00:40:16.140 align:start position:0%
then that is the use of both artificial
 
00:40:21.130 --> 00:40:21.140 align:start position:0%
intelligence and artificial organs and
 
00:40:24.170 --> 00:40:24.180 align:start position:0%
artificial intelligence is of course a
 
00:40:27.530 --> 00:40:27.540 align:start position:0%
burgeoning area and I totally agree that
 
00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:31.740 align:start position:0%
we ought to at least pay homage to that
 
00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:33.849 align:start position:0%
we ought to at least pay homage to that
but

00:40:33.849 --> 00:40:33.859 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:40:37.130 --> 00:40:37.140 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is in the process of
 
00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
becoming the national Center for created
 
00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:46.020 align:start position:0%
organ systems uh as you know we have a
 
00:40:48.349 --> 00:40:48.359 align:start position:0%
substantial Grant from the Department of
 
00:40:51.410 --> 00:40:51.420 align:start position:0%
Defense that has gone to a Consortium of
 
00:40:54.109 --> 00:40:54.119 align:start position:0%
organizations I'm going to say led by
 
00:40:58.250 --> 00:40:58.260 align:start position:0%
and that is my interpretation uh uh DACA
 
00:41:00.349 --> 00:41:00.359 align:start position:0%
uh Dean cayman's organization in
 
00:41:03.589 --> 00:41:03.599 align:start position:0%
Manchester and they are developing the
 
00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
technology for uh created organs I think
 
00:41:10.970 --> 00:41:10.980 align:start position:0%
it's a very very good idea to include
 
00:41:13.849 --> 00:41:13.859 align:start position:0%
that uh within our verbiage so I'm
 
00:41:15.829 --> 00:41:15.839 align:start position:0%
grateful for that
 
00:41:15.839 --> 00:41:17.170 align:start position:0%
grateful for that
um

00:41:17.170 --> 00:41:17.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:20.329 --> 00:41:20.339 align:start position:0%
yeah so it sounds to me like you're open
 
00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
to some paragraph Charlie as I read it
 
00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
and I'll send it to you and it so if we
 
00:41:27.589 --> 00:41:27.599 align:start position:0%
do that then
 
00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:31.500 align:start position:0%
um on page two the the First full
 
00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
paragraph that starts with Medical
 
00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:37.329 align:start position:0%
paragraph that starts with Medical
Technology

00:41:37.329 --> 00:41:37.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:40.730 --> 00:41:40.740 align:start position:0%
there's a sentence that says this
 
00:41:43.970 --> 00:41:43.980 align:start position:0%
requires that as technology changes it
 
00:41:46.310 --> 00:41:46.320 align:start position:0%
is a state responsibility to assess its
 
00:41:49.010 --> 00:41:49.020 align:start position:0%
role in facilitating development
 
00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:52.260 align:start position:0%
and distribution of preventive and
 
00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:55.740 align:start position:0%
Curative Technologies I I would just ask
 
00:41:58.490 --> 00:41:58.500 align:start position:0%
you if you think we might want to before
 
00:42:01.130 --> 00:42:01.140 align:start position:0%
the word preventative insert the word
 
00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
diagnostic or are we not wanting to look
 
00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
at emerging technology that has only a
 
00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:10.740 align:start position:0%
diagnostic value
 
00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
uh I think that's an important idea
 
00:42:16.609 --> 00:42:16.619 align:start position:0%
addition I'd be very happy with that
 
00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
okay I'll send that to you as well
 
00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:21.900 align:start position:0%
that's already in there okay no we're
 
00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
not diagnostic you just wrote the word I
 
00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:26.700 align:start position:0%
just Instagram my note yes sir and and
 
00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
then the task for shall and then it says
 
00:42:31.970 --> 00:42:31.980 align:start position:0%
Alpha so this is our task it said that
 
00:42:34.730 --> 00:42:34.740 align:start position:0%
we're just illicit definitions of Bio
 
00:42:37.730 --> 00:42:37.740 align:start position:0%
testing Precision medicine did are those
 
00:42:39.589 --> 00:42:39.599 align:start position:0%
definitions in the appendix I don't
 
00:42:42.589 --> 00:42:42.599 align:start position:0%
recall the appendix if it had those I
 
00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
mean we we did I think no get good
 
00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
definitions that we could be reporting
 
00:42:50.569 --> 00:42:50.579 align:start position:0%
out I believe the definitions are not in
 
00:42:53.810 --> 00:42:53.820 align:start position:0%
there uh the definitions were waiting
 
00:42:56.690 --> 00:42:56.700 align:start position:0%
for testimony from the experts that we
 
00:43:00.309 --> 00:43:00.319 align:start position:0%
had lined up uh but we changed our Focus
 
00:43:03.710 --> 00:43:03.720 align:start position:0%
uh with uh representative Woods guidance
 
00:43:07.849 --> 00:43:07.859 align:start position:0%
from uh Precision medicine to biomarker
 
00:43:10.730 --> 00:43:10.740 align:start position:0%
testing and we've written this report
 
00:43:13.970 --> 00:43:13.980 align:start position:0%
without having that testimony and so
 
00:43:15.109 --> 00:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
this would
 
00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
place the burden of responsibility for
 
00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
developing those definitions on the task
 
00:43:23.210 --> 00:43:23.220 align:start position:0%
force that emerges shouldn't emerge
 
00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
should there be an LSR
 
00:43:28.309 --> 00:43:28.319 align:start position:0%
okay so we just don't put a check mark
 
00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:31.260 align:start position:0%
as completed because this because that
 
00:43:33.589 --> 00:43:33.599 align:start position:0%
paragraph of the task force shall tend
 
00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
to be our homework assignment and we we
 
00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
decided that we didn't need to do that
 
00:43:40.210 --> 00:43:40.220 align:start position:0%
right okay thank you
 
00:43:42.770 --> 00:43:42.780 align:start position:0%
further comments
 
00:43:45.829 --> 00:43:45.839 align:start position:0%
oh yes representative Woods oh yes I I
 
00:43:48.170 --> 00:43:48.180 align:start position:0%
would agree with the comments I I would
 
00:43:50.809 --> 00:43:50.819 align:start position:0%
just uh in terms of the term
 
00:43:50.819 --> 00:43:52.790 align:start position:0%
just uh in terms of the term
Technologies

00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
Technologies
 
00:43:54.770 --> 00:43:54.780 align:start position:0%
um in in the
 
00:43:57.170 --> 00:43:57.180 align:start position:0%
in the academic world and in the
 
00:43:59.569 --> 00:43:59.579 align:start position:0%
commercial world the term technology
 
00:44:03.589 --> 00:44:03.599 align:start position:0%
includes Ai and and so in this sense but
 
00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
I think it's worthwhile as an effort to
 
00:44:10.190 --> 00:44:10.200 align:start position:0%
parse that out specifically but in the
 
00:44:12.530 --> 00:44:12.540 align:start position:0%
in the academic and in the academic
 
00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
world the technology and if you read
 
00:44:18.589 --> 00:44:18.599 align:start position:0%
some of the literature it's um something
 
00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
called hard technology versus soft
 
00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:22.680 align:start position:0%
Technologies uh but it's it's really is
 
00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:24.170 align:start position:0%
Technologies uh but it's it's really is
included

00:44:24.170 --> 00:44:24.180 align:start position:0%
included
 
00:44:27.109 --> 00:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
um and again not not say that we
 
00:44:28.609 --> 00:44:28.619 align:start position:0%
shouldn't I think it's important that
 
00:44:32.690 --> 00:44:32.700 align:start position:0%
that might be added for those who are
 
00:44:35.750 --> 00:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
reading the report uh and uh looking to
 
00:44:38.270 --> 00:44:38.280 align:start position:0%
what we would cover uh to make sure that
 
00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
that's that is and brought out and um in
 
00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
the same way for uh preventive and
 
00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
Curative Technologies adding Diagnostics
 
00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
that preventive making a diagnosis in by
 
00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
implication as a preventive measure
 
00:44:57.109 --> 00:44:57.119 align:start position:0%
um but I think to make that spec make
 
00:45:00.170 --> 00:45:00.180 align:start position:0%
that specific uh I think is is also good
 
00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
so I appreciate you I appreciate the
 
00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
additions you know as an ex-radiology
 
00:45:07.130 --> 00:45:07.140 align:start position:0%
administrator who fed my family from
 
00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
that I'd like doing a shout out to
 
00:45:13.849 --> 00:45:13.859 align:start position:0%
Diagnostic Imaging from time to time so
 
00:45:13.859 --> 00:45:16.609 align:start position:0%
Diagnostic Imaging from time to time so
yeah

00:45:16.609 --> 00:45:16.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:23.450 --> 00:45:23.460 align:start position:0%
if you will email me changes if you have
 
00:45:26.210 --> 00:45:26.220 align:start position:0%
specific wording that you want in
 
00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
um I will make those changes and I will
 
00:45:32.990 --> 00:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
submit this draft uh to the oversight
 
00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
committee and I will recess this meeting
 
00:45:40.790 --> 00:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
um and I am not calling a follow-up
 
00:45:43.430 --> 00:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
meeting ladies and gentlemen thank you
 
00:45:48.109 --> 00:45:48.119 align:start position:0%

00:46:08.930 --> 00:46:08.940 align:start position:0%
you know this is a very exciting time of
 
00:46:13.970 --> 00:46:13.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:13.980 --> 03:05:32.450 align:start position:0%
 
mine

03:05:32.450 --> 03:05:32.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:34.510 --> 03:05:34.520 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:05:37.969 --> 03:05:37.979 align:start position:0%
I'm opening the meeting of the
 
03:05:41.809 --> 03:05:41.819 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on transparency a
 
03:05:45.349 --> 03:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
subcommittee appointed uh last month by
 
03:05:48.530 --> 03:05:48.540 align:start position:0%
The Joint legislative DHHS oversight
 
03:05:48.540 --> 03:05:50.210 align:start position:0%
The Joint legislative DHHS oversight
committee

03:05:50.210 --> 03:05:50.220 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:05:50.220 --> 03:05:52.969 align:start position:0%
committee
and

03:05:52.969 --> 03:05:52.979 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:05:55.490 --> 03:05:55.500 align:start position:0%
just a review and the reason I'm
 
03:05:59.570 --> 03:05:59.580 align:start position:0%
reviewing is documents have come to in
 
03:06:02.389 --> 03:06:02.399 align:start position:0%
some cases me and other cases the
 
03:06:05.690 --> 03:06:05.700 align:start position:0%
members of the committee which uh
 
03:06:08.269 --> 03:06:08.279 align:start position:0%
evidence the individuals have jumped in
 
03:06:10.070 --> 03:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
quite late
 
03:06:13.130 --> 03:06:13.140 align:start position:0%
so let me just very quickly review what
 
03:06:15.290 --> 03:06:15.300 align:start position:0%
we hope to do
 
03:06:19.030 --> 03:06:19.040 align:start position:0%
we hope to protect the public
 
03:06:23.870 --> 03:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
by disclosing egregious conduct on the
 
03:06:26.389 --> 03:06:26.399 align:start position:0%
part of medical professionals
 
03:06:29.230 --> 03:06:29.240 align:start position:0%
and we also want to protect the good
 
03:06:33.230 --> 03:06:33.240 align:start position:0%
professionals and hospitals from
 
03:06:36.530 --> 03:06:36.540 align:start position:0%
something that may be misinterpreted as
 
03:06:39.830 --> 03:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
bad conduct when in fact it wasn't
 
03:06:44.030 --> 03:06:44.040 align:start position:0%
I received an email this morning from Dr
 
03:06:46.330 --> 03:06:46.340 align:start position:0%

providers is adequately looked after
 
03:07:11.990 --> 03:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
especially in the light of what may be
 
03:07:13.969 --> 03:07:13.979 align:start position:0%
false accusations so we want to get it

Attorney General's office to see if laws
 
03:07:26.510 --> 03:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
were broken in reporting or
 
03:07:30.410 --> 03:07:30.420 align:start position:0%
non-reporting over the last several
 
03:07:33.170 --> 03:07:33.180 align:start position:0%
months they're not ready to come forward
 
03:07:35.929 --> 03:07:35.939 align:start position:0%
with anything at this time they suspect
 
03:07:37.269 --> 03:07:37.279 align:start position:0%
it may be
 
03:07:39.710 --> 03:07:39.720 align:start position:0%
two to four weeks
 
03:07:43.250 --> 03:07:43.260 align:start position:0%

they oversee

the purpose of this group here is to
 
03:08:06.410 --> 03:08:06.420 align:start position:0%
find the best way to get all of this
 
03:08:06.420 --> 03:08:07.389 align:start position:0%
find the best way to get all of this
done

03:08:07.389 --> 03:08:07.399 align:start position:0%
done
 
03:08:10.730 --> 03:08:10.740 align:start position:0%
who reports who may report complaints
 
03:08:14.030 --> 03:08:14.040 align:start position:0%
how do they do it who evaluates the

complaints and at what level is
 
03:08:18.889 --> 03:08:18.899 align:start position:0%

Lindsay Courtney if you would come up to
 
03:08:29.590 --> 03:08:29.600 align:start position:0%
say a little bit about the relationship
 
03:08:33.349 --> 03:08:33.359 align:start position:0%
between oplc and the Board of Medicine
 
03:08:35.990 --> 03:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
on this issue
 
03:08:37.910 --> 03:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
thank you good afternoon Representative
 
03:08:39.950 --> 03:08:39.960 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
03:08:41.630 --> 03:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
Wednesday Courtney executive director
 
03:08:44.090 --> 03:08:44.100 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire office of professional Ace
 
03:08:45.769 --> 03:08:45.779 align:start position:0%
insurance certification
 
03:08:47.750 --> 03:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
so in terms of the relationship between
 
03:08:50.570 --> 03:08:50.580 align:start position:0%
the boards and the office the office was
 
03:08:52.969 --> 03:08:52.979 align:start position:0%
created in 2015 through a budget trailer
 
03:08:55.849 --> 03:08:55.859 align:start position:0%
process under Governor Hassan to provide
 
03:08:57.530 --> 03:08:57.540 align:start position:0%
administrative support to all of our
 
03:08:59.690 --> 03:08:59.700 align:start position:0%
licensing boards
 
03:09:03.410 --> 03:09:03.420 align:start position:0%
um so plainly speaking the boards the
 
03:09:06.349 --> 03:09:06.359 align:start position:0%
office is the primary location for all
 
03:09:08.150 --> 03:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
of the boards they do not have separate
 
03:09:10.370 --> 03:09:10.380 align:start position:0%
staff they do not have separate funding
 
03:09:12.550 --> 03:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
they do not have a separate location
 
03:09:15.110 --> 03:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
everything is run through the office in
 
03:09:16.490 --> 03:09:16.500 align:start position:0%
terms of funding and administrative
 
03:09:20.450 --> 03:09:20.460 align:start position:0%
support we have one website by way we
 
03:09:23.349 --> 03:09:23.359 align:start position:0%
provide by by through which we provide
 
03:09:25.849 --> 03:09:25.859 align:start position:0%
Communications and web support for all
 
03:09:27.469 --> 03:09:27.479 align:start position:0%
of the boards but everything is run
 
03:09:30.590 --> 03:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
through the office for each
 
03:09:30.600 --> 03:09:32.510 align:start position:0%
through the office for each
board

03:09:32.510 --> 03:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
board
 
03:09:34.790 --> 03:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any more questions with
 
03:09:37.490 --> 03:09:37.500 align:start position:0%
respect to that issue but basically any
 
03:09:39.230 --> 03:09:39.240 align:start position:0%
function that is Administrative in
 
03:09:41.389 --> 03:09:41.399 align:start position:0%
nature is performed by the office on
 
03:09:43.670 --> 03:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
behalf of all of the boards in
 
03:09:45.170 --> 03:09:45.180 align:start position:0%
accordance with the regulations that are
 
03:09:46.910 --> 03:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
propagated by that board
 
03:09:50.630 --> 03:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
this is why people who have a complaint
 
03:09:53.690 --> 03:09:53.700 align:start position:0%
and go to the board of medicines website
 
03:09:59.030 --> 03:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
are immediately directed to oplc yes
 
03:10:01.870 --> 03:10:01.880 align:start position:0%
yes that's correct there are no board
 
03:10:04.550 --> 03:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
there are no employees employed by each
 
03:10:06.590 --> 03:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
board the board members are not
 
03:10:09.590 --> 03:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
physically at the office unless they are
 
03:10:09.600 --> 03:10:10.670 align:start position:0%
physically at the office unless they are
meeting

03:10:10.670 --> 03:10:10.680 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
03:10:14.090 --> 03:10:14.100 align:start position:0%
um personally 1091a therefore the staff
 
03:10:15.950 --> 03:10:15.960 align:start position:0%
that are in receipt of that information
 
03:10:19.790 --> 03:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
are from the office additionally we have
 
03:10:23.929 --> 03:10:23.939 align:start position:0%
been charged under RSA 310a with trying
 
03:10:27.170 --> 03:10:27.180 align:start position:0%
to streamline the processes and
 
03:10:29.510 --> 03:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
procedures including those procedures as
 
03:10:32.210 --> 03:10:32.220 align:start position:0%
it relates to investigations and receipt
 
03:10:34.910 --> 03:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
of complaints part of providing
 
03:10:37.250 --> 03:10:37.260 align:start position:0%
efficient and economic Services which is
 
03:10:40.670 --> 03:10:40.680 align:start position:0%
our mission in RSA 310a is to ensure
 
03:10:43.070 --> 03:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
that we do not have 54 different ways of
 
03:10:45.050 --> 03:10:45.060 align:start position:0%
doing business which was historically
 
03:10:48.110 --> 03:10:48.120 align:start position:0%
the case prior to the office's creation
 
03:10:51.769 --> 03:10:51.779 align:start position:0%
so recently I want I think it was in
 
03:10:55.490 --> 03:10:55.500 align:start position:0%
2019 representative we sought additional
 
03:10:57.969 --> 03:10:57.979 align:start position:0%
statutory authority to probably
 
03:11:00.410 --> 03:11:00.420 align:start position:0%
investigative rules at the office level
 
03:11:03.710 --> 03:11:03.720 align:start position:0%
those rules were recently promulgated
 
03:11:06.889 --> 03:11:06.899 align:start position:0%
RPS PLC 200s which direct that
 
03:11:10.250 --> 03:11:10.260 align:start position:0%
complaints be filed with the office
 
03:11:12.590 --> 03:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
let's suppose somebody goes to the Board
 
03:11:15.769 --> 03:11:15.779 align:start position:0%
of Medicine website with a complaint is
 
03:11:19.790 --> 03:11:19.800 align:start position:0%
directed over to oplc what happens next
 
03:11:21.950 --> 03:11:21.960 align:start position:0%
so if I received a complaint
 
03:11:25.010 --> 03:11:25.020 align:start position:0%
um it's screened in by our intake staff
 
03:11:29.090 --> 03:11:29.100 align:start position:0%
member who assesses whether or not it
 
03:11:32.330 --> 03:11:32.340 align:start position:0%
could constitute an emergency if it
 
03:11:34.450 --> 03:11:34.460 align:start position:0%
could constitute an emergency
 
03:11:37.309 --> 03:11:37.319 align:start position:0%
posing an imminent danger to your you
 
03:11:40.670 --> 03:11:40.680 align:start position:0%
know Public Safety health or welfare
 
03:11:43.010 --> 03:11:43.020 align:start position:0%
um that is elevated up to the
 
03:11:44.870 --> 03:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
investigative bureau's Chief bureau
 
03:11:46.790 --> 03:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
chief who makes an assessment in
 
03:11:46.800 --> 03:11:48.170 align:start position:0%
chief who makes an assessment in
consultation

03:11:48.170 --> 03:11:48.180 align:start position:0%
consultation
 
03:11:51.590 --> 03:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
um with the physician staff investigator
 
03:11:53.870 --> 03:11:53.880 align:start position:0%
and they decide whether or not to
 
03:11:57.769 --> 03:11:57.779 align:start position:0%
conduct an expedited investigation we
 
03:11:59.870 --> 03:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
don't act just on receipt of a complaint
 
03:12:02.030 --> 03:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
at least some information needs to be
 
03:12:04.429 --> 03:12:04.439 align:start position:0%
verified because people do file
 
03:12:08.090 --> 03:12:08.100 align:start position:0%
complaints that turn out to be frivolous
 
03:12:10.130 --> 03:12:10.140 align:start position:0%
so once the information is verified at
 
03:12:13.309 --> 03:12:13.319 align:start position:0%
an emergency nature if it's decided that
 
03:12:17.450 --> 03:12:17.460 align:start position:0%
um that the issue could constitute an
 
03:12:19.849 --> 03:12:19.859 align:start position:0%
emergency the board chair is notified
 
03:12:21.889 --> 03:12:21.899 align:start position:0%
only the board chair has the authority
 
03:12:25.250 --> 03:12:25.260 align:start position:0%
to call an emergency meeting if the
 
03:12:26.870 --> 03:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
board chair decides to call an emergency
 
03:12:29.330 --> 03:12:29.340 align:start position:0%
meeting the board considers whether or
 
03:12:31.250 --> 03:12:31.260 align:start position:0%
not to emergency suspend somebody's
 
03:12:33.769 --> 03:12:33.779 align:start position:0%
license on the flip side if it's not an
 
03:12:37.370 --> 03:12:37.380 align:start position:0%
emergency then it goes in essentially in
 
03:12:38.450 --> 03:12:38.460 align:start position:0%
the queue
 
03:12:41.389 --> 03:12:41.399 align:start position:0%
it's logged in as a complaint it's
 
03:12:44.050 --> 03:12:44.060 align:start position:0%
assigned to a staff investigator
 
03:12:47.090 --> 03:12:47.100 align:start position:0%
as well as the physician investigator so
 
03:12:49.490 --> 03:12:49.500 align:start position:0%
I'll there's two separate processes I
 
03:12:51.530 --> 03:12:51.540 align:start position:0%
should say there's the process for the
 
03:12:53.210 --> 03:12:53.220 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine and there's a process
 
03:12:55.429 --> 03:12:55.439 align:start position:0%
for every other board the Board of
 
03:12:57.410 --> 03:12:57.420 align:start position:0%
Medicine is unique in that it has the
 
03:13:00.170 --> 03:13:00.180 align:start position:0%
statutory medical review subcommittee
 
03:13:03.349 --> 03:13:03.359 align:start position:0%
every other board with the exception of
 
03:13:05.870 --> 03:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
them I should say the board of mental
 
03:13:07.190 --> 03:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
health practice has a professional
 
03:13:09.490 --> 03:13:09.500 align:start position:0%
conduct committee but every other board
 
03:13:12.710 --> 03:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
under the office we receive a complaint
 
03:13:14.630 --> 03:13:14.640 align:start position:0%
we log it it's assigned to a staff
 
03:13:16.969 --> 03:13:16.979 align:start position:0%
investigator who works the case up free
 
03:13:20.090 --> 03:13:20.100 align:start position:0%
of your staff of my staff yep
 
03:13:22.550 --> 03:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
and they're trained investigators if
 
03:13:24.110 --> 03:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
it's assessed during the course of the
 
03:13:25.849 --> 03:13:25.859 align:start position:0%
investigation that expertise is
 
03:13:28.010 --> 03:13:28.020 align:start position:0%
warranted then
 
03:13:30.469 --> 03:13:30.479 align:start position:0%
um typically a board member will recuse
 
03:13:33.830 --> 03:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
him or herself to provide that expertise
 
03:13:36.170 --> 03:13:36.180 align:start position:0%
or we
 
03:13:38.750 --> 03:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
um reach out to a consultant we retain a
 
03:13:40.849 --> 03:13:40.859 align:start position:0%
consultant to provide that level of
 
03:13:40.859 --> 03:13:42.230 align:start position:0%
consultant to provide that level of
expertise

03:13:42.230 --> 03:13:42.240 align:start position:0%
expertise
 
03:13:45.250 --> 03:13:45.260 align:start position:0%
the staff member will
 
03:13:47.929 --> 03:13:47.939 align:start position:0%
complete the investigation draft up a
 
03:13:50.809 --> 03:13:50.819 align:start position:0%
report of investigation and submit that
 
03:13:52.910 --> 03:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
to the board the board will make a
 
03:13:54.650 --> 03:13:54.660 align:start position:0%
decision as to whether or not which
 
03:13:54.660 --> 03:13:55.490 align:start position:0%
decision as to whether or not which
board

03:13:55.490 --> 03:13:55.500 align:start position:0%
board
 
03:13:58.429 --> 03:13:58.439 align:start position:0%
any other word other than other than the
 
03:13:59.630 --> 03:13:59.640 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine the Board of Medicine
 
03:14:01.550 --> 03:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
has a different process all right I want
 
03:14:04.309 --> 03:14:04.319 align:start position:0%
to know about that but I think
 
03:14:05.870 --> 03:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
I'm getting their representative I think
 
03:14:07.610 --> 03:14:07.620 align:start position:0%
it's important to understand how things
 
03:14:09.469 --> 03:14:09.479 align:start position:0%
generally operate within the office so
 
03:14:11.330 --> 03:14:11.340 align:start position:0%
you can make an assessment as to you
 
03:14:13.550 --> 03:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
know what the process should be moving
 
03:14:13.560 --> 03:14:15.469 align:start position:0%
know what the process should be moving
forward

03:14:15.469 --> 03:14:15.479 align:start position:0%
forward
 
03:14:18.170 --> 03:14:18.180 align:start position:0%
so the board will make a decision after
 
03:14:20.870 --> 03:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
receiving a report of Investigation as
 
03:14:22.790 --> 03:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
to whether or not additional information
 
03:14:25.490 --> 03:14:25.500 align:start position:0%
is warranted the case should be
 
03:14:28.190 --> 03:14:28.200 align:start position:0%
dismissed or the case should received a
 
03:14:30.950 --> 03:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action if the case is to
 
03:14:32.809 --> 03:14:32.819 align:start position:0%
proceed to disciplinary the case is
 
03:14:34.429 --> 03:14:34.439 align:start position:0%
handed off to a prosecutor who
 
03:14:35.929 --> 03:14:35.939 align:start position:0%
prosecutes the case
 
03:14:37.490 --> 03:14:37.500 align:start position:0%
now with respect to the Board of
 
03:14:37.500 --> 03:14:39.230 align:start position:0%
now with respect to the Board of
Medicine

03:14:39.230 --> 03:14:39.240 align:start position:0%
Medicine
 
03:14:41.710 --> 03:14:41.720 align:start position:0%
case comes in it gets logged in
 
03:14:45.110 --> 03:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
essentially The Physician investigator
 
03:14:47.630 --> 03:14:47.640 align:start position:0%
is required under their rules to make an
 
03:14:50.030 --> 03:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
assessment as to whether or not the case
 
03:14:52.910 --> 03:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
is facially valid meaning whether the
 
03:14:55.250 --> 03:14:55.260 align:start position:0%
case States a claim
 
03:14:57.410 --> 03:14:57.420 align:start position:0%
um if the case does not State a claim
 
03:14:59.389 --> 03:14:59.399 align:start position:0%
the rules require and the statute
 
03:15:00.950 --> 03:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
requires that it go to the Board of
 
03:15:03.349 --> 03:15:03.359 align:start position:0%
Medicine the Board of Medicine can make
 
03:15:06.530 --> 03:15:06.540 align:start position:0%
a decision to dismiss the case or refer
 
03:15:08.510 --> 03:15:08.520 align:start position:0%
to the medical review subcommittee which
 
03:15:10.370 --> 03:15:10.380 align:start position:0%
is a statutory body comprised of
 
03:15:13.269 --> 03:15:13.279 align:start position:0%
volunteer Physicians and public members
 
03:15:16.670 --> 03:15:16.680 align:start position:0%
to oversee investigations under the
 
03:15:18.230 --> 03:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine
 
03:15:21.110 --> 03:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
if the physician investigator decides
 
03:15:24.110 --> 03:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
that it does State a claim the physician
 
03:15:27.050 --> 03:15:27.060 align:start position:0%
investigator working with the chair of
 
03:15:30.050 --> 03:15:30.060 align:start position:0%
the medical review subcommittee assigns
 
03:15:32.990 --> 03:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
medical review subcommittee physician
 
03:15:36.410 --> 03:15:36.420 align:start position:0%
member or public member to oversee and
 
03:15:38.750 --> 03:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
investigate that case
 
03:15:42.290 --> 03:15:42.300 align:start position:0%
we are able to provide and we do provide
 
03:15:45.969 --> 03:15:45.979 align:start position:0%
staff assistance but essentially the
 
03:15:47.750 --> 03:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
member of the medical review
 
03:15:47.760 --> 03:15:49.269 align:start position:0%
member of the medical review
subcommittee

03:15:49.269 --> 03:15:49.279 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
03:15:52.670 --> 03:15:52.680 align:start position:0%
controls the case they manage that case
 
03:15:55.849 --> 03:15:55.859 align:start position:0%
they dropped up the ROI which is what I
 
03:15:57.410 --> 03:15:57.420 align:start position:0%
spoke of earlier the report of
 
03:15:57.420 --> 03:15:59.150 align:start position:0%
spoke of earlier the report of
Investigation

03:15:59.150 --> 03:15:59.160 align:start position:0%
Investigation
 
03:16:02.210 --> 03:16:02.220 align:start position:0%
um which once complete is provided to
 
03:16:05.090 --> 03:16:05.100 align:start position:0%
the entire medical review subcommittee
 
03:16:06.650 --> 03:16:06.660 align:start position:0%
which then
 
03:16:09.110 --> 03:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
um makes a recommendation for someone to
 
03:16:11.450 --> 03:16:11.460 align:start position:0%
a vote to the Board of Medicine as to
 
03:16:14.650 --> 03:16:14.660 align:start position:0%
whether to dismiss or to proceed to
 
03:16:17.450 --> 03:16:17.460 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action and then it falls
 
03:16:19.490 --> 03:16:19.500 align:start position:0%
follows the same process for every other
 
03:16:19.500 --> 03:16:27.950 align:start position:0%
follows the same process for every other
board

03:16:27.950 --> 03:16:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:31.550 --> 03:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
question representative Edwards uh okay
 
03:16:34.250 --> 03:16:34.260 align:start position:0%
so thank you Ms Courtney that was a
 
03:16:36.050 --> 03:16:36.060 align:start position:0%
really nice description of the
 
03:16:39.530 --> 03:16:39.540 align:start position:0%
underlying data flow and it was so
 
03:16:41.990 --> 03:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
precise I was imagining as you were
 
03:16:44.230 --> 03:16:44.240 align:start position:0%
talking that there's a flowchart
 
03:16:47.170 --> 03:16:47.180 align:start position:0%
documenting what you just said
 
03:16:50.870 --> 03:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
and if so could you provide us a copy of
 
03:16:52.309 --> 03:16:52.319 align:start position:0%
that flow chart or if you haven't
 
03:16:54.889 --> 03:16:54.899 align:start position:0%
already yes absolutely representative
 
03:16:57.050 --> 03:16:57.060 align:start position:0%
okay uh thank you for that
 
03:16:57.060 --> 03:16:58.150 align:start position:0%
okay uh thank you for that
um

03:16:58.150 --> 03:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:17:01.070 --> 03:17:01.080 align:start position:0%
also as you were talking about the data
 
03:17:01.080 --> 03:17:02.330 align:start position:0%
also as you were talking about the data
flow

03:17:02.330 --> 03:17:02.340 align:start position:0%
flow
 
03:17:05.330 --> 03:17:05.340 align:start position:0%
um I was drifting off into one of my
 
03:17:09.290 --> 03:17:09.300 align:start position:0%
pastimes years ago of worrying about the
 
03:17:13.070 --> 03:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
user interface with with websites and so
 
03:17:14.870 --> 03:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious
 
03:17:17.929 --> 03:17:17.939 align:start position:0%
um when somebody wants to make a
 
03:17:19.730 --> 03:17:19.740 align:start position:0%
complaint of Board of Medicine
 
03:17:21.769 --> 03:17:21.779 align:start position:0%
complaints specifically
 
03:17:24.950 --> 03:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
when they navigate in to make a
 
03:17:24.960 --> 03:17:26.650 align:start position:0%
when they navigate in to make a
complaint

03:17:26.650 --> 03:17:26.660 align:start position:0%
complaint
 
03:17:30.050 --> 03:17:30.060 align:start position:0%
is the user experience one or they
 
03:17:31.849 --> 03:17:31.859 align:start position:0%
believe that they're talking to the
 
03:17:34.550 --> 03:17:34.560 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine or it doesn't appear
 
03:17:36.790 --> 03:17:36.800 align:start position:0%
as though it's a
 
03:17:39.950 --> 03:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
standard bureaucratic this is the oplc
 
03:17:44.110 --> 03:17:44.120 align:start position:0%
we handle everything from cats to zebras
 
03:17:46.969 --> 03:17:46.979 align:start position:0%
it's it's hard to assess what the user
 
03:17:49.849 --> 03:17:49.859 align:start position:0%
believes I think oftentimes
 
03:17:52.370 --> 03:17:52.380 align:start position:0%
the oplc is fairly young I think most
 
03:17:53.929 --> 03:17:53.939 align:start position:0%
people don't really understand what we
 
03:17:56.210 --> 03:17:56.220 align:start position:0%
do on behalf of the boards and there's
 
03:17:58.309 --> 03:17:58.319 align:start position:0%
putting aside the investigations and
 
03:17:58.319 --> 03:17:59.990 align:start position:0%
putting aside the investigations and
complaints

03:17:59.990 --> 03:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
complaints
 
03:18:00.000 --> 03:18:00.650 align:start position:0%
complaints
um

03:18:00.650 --> 03:18:00.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:02.510 --> 03:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
reason to interface with their office I
 
03:18:04.730 --> 03:18:04.740 align:start position:0%
think there's a often a misunderstanding
 
03:18:07.730 --> 03:18:07.740 align:start position:0%
on the part of the consumer that when
 
03:18:09.410 --> 03:18:09.420 align:start position:0%
they come to our office they talk to
 
03:18:09.420 --> 03:18:10.389 align:start position:0%
they come to our office they talk to
somebody

03:18:10.389 --> 03:18:10.399 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
03:18:12.650 --> 03:18:12.660 align:start position:0%
they can believe that they're speaking
 
03:18:14.210 --> 03:18:14.220 align:start position:0%
with the Board of Medicine Real Estate
 
03:18:17.150 --> 03:18:17.160 align:start position:0%
Commission yada yada
 
03:18:19.190 --> 03:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
um in reality I think I mean that's not
 
03:18:21.110 --> 03:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
supposed to happen ever you know that
 
03:18:23.630 --> 03:18:23.640 align:start position:0%
you just be able to talk to a member of
 
03:18:25.190 --> 03:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
the board because the board can only
 
03:18:27.349 --> 03:18:27.359 align:start position:0%
collectively act collectively a pursue
 
03:18:29.150 --> 03:18:29.160 align:start position:0%
into a quorum
 
03:18:31.309 --> 03:18:31.319 align:start position:0%
um I think if if they file a complaint
 
03:18:33.590 --> 03:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
through our website it's it's going to
 
03:18:36.769 --> 03:18:36.779 align:start position:0%
be a fairly obvious to most users that
 
03:18:39.769 --> 03:18:39.779 align:start position:0%
they are filing it with the office and
 
03:18:41.389 --> 03:18:41.399 align:start position:0%
there's some information on our website
 
03:18:44.809 --> 03:18:44.819 align:start position:0%
that sets forth the investigations flow
 
03:18:48.469 --> 03:18:48.479 align:start position:0%
so what if I were to say that I think it
 
03:18:50.090 --> 03:18:50.100 align:start position:0%
would be important from the user
 
03:18:51.950 --> 03:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
perspective that when they go in there
 
03:18:54.230 --> 03:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
with the idea that they're reporting to
 
03:18:56.690 --> 03:18:56.700 align:start position:0%
the Board of Medicine that the splash
 
03:18:59.510 --> 03:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
splash screens and the images and the
 
03:19:01.790 --> 03:19:01.800 align:start position:0%
words look to them like they're
 
03:19:03.290 --> 03:19:03.300 align:start position:0%
interacting with the Board of Medicine
 
03:19:05.150 --> 03:19:05.160 align:start position:0%
instead of something they don't
 
03:19:07.870 --> 03:19:07.880 align:start position:0%
understand the oplc
 
03:19:11.990 --> 03:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
one that that's my theory that people
 
03:19:13.670 --> 03:19:13.680 align:start position:0%
would have more confidence that they're
 
03:19:16.190 --> 03:19:16.200 align:start position:0%
reporting properly and therefore would
 
03:19:18.410 --> 03:19:18.420 align:start position:0%
go all the way sort of a complaint
 
03:19:18.420 --> 03:19:19.570 align:start position:0%
go all the way sort of a complaint
process

03:19:19.570 --> 03:19:19.580 align:start position:0%
process
 
03:19:22.550 --> 03:19:22.560 align:start position:0%
and two that that the design of the
 
03:19:24.769 --> 03:19:24.779 align:start position:0%
website can be set up so that the splash
 
03:19:27.410 --> 03:19:27.420 align:start position:0%
screens can help create that look and
 
03:19:30.769 --> 03:19:30.779 align:start position:0%
feel that's my theory what what how do
 
03:19:32.570 --> 03:19:32.580 align:start position:0%
you react to that
 
03:19:34.370 --> 03:19:34.380 align:start position:0%
well I don't think we have a reporting
 
03:19:34.380 --> 03:19:35.570 align:start position:0%
well I don't think we have a reporting
problem

03:19:35.570 --> 03:19:35.580 align:start position:0%
problem
 
03:19:37.969 --> 03:19:37.979 align:start position:0%
um I I think people are able to make
 
03:19:37.979 --> 03:19:39.190 align:start position:0%
um I I think people are able to make
complaints

03:19:39.190 --> 03:19:39.200 align:start position:0%
complaints
 
03:19:41.690 --> 03:19:41.700 align:start position:0%
at the board of nursing I just went over
 
03:19:45.530 --> 03:19:45.540 align:start position:0%
the statistics last night we received a
 
03:19:47.750 --> 03:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
little over 200 complaints for the Board
 
03:19:50.510 --> 03:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
of Nursing last year somewhere in the
 
03:19:53.450 --> 03:19:53.460 align:start position:0%
realm of 170 I can get you the precise
 
03:19:56.870 --> 03:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
numbers for the Board of Medicine
 
03:19:56.880 --> 03:19:57.590 align:start position:0%
numbers for the Board of Medicine
um

03:19:57.590 --> 03:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:20:00.830 --> 03:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
so I guess I would so I don't think that
 
03:20:03.590 --> 03:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
people are afraid to report
 
03:20:05.809 --> 03:20:05.819 align:start position:0%
um if that's the case then certainly we
 
03:20:08.450 --> 03:20:08.460 align:start position:0%
should explore modifications to our
 
03:20:10.070 --> 03:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
website but also communication
 
03:20:13.250 --> 03:20:13.260 align:start position:0%
strategies but at the end of the day the
 
03:20:15.530 --> 03:20:15.540 align:start position:0%
office's obligation is to provide that
 
03:20:17.870 --> 03:20:17.880 align:start position:0%
service so I'm not sure that changing
 
03:20:21.349 --> 03:20:21.359 align:start position:0%
the way we look is the best approach it
 
03:20:24.110 --> 03:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
may just be educating the end user as to
 
03:20:25.670 --> 03:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
what our
 
03:20:29.290 --> 03:20:29.300 align:start position:0%
um our role is in this process
 
03:20:32.330 --> 03:20:32.340 align:start position:0%
with the flow chart we requested bear
 
03:20:34.910 --> 03:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
striking similarity to this that does
 
03:20:37.429 --> 03:20:37.439 align:start position:0%
appear to be
 
03:20:40.309 --> 03:20:40.319 align:start position:0%
the one maybe that I had forwarded to
 
03:20:41.929 --> 03:20:41.939 align:start position:0%
your previously representative but I
 
03:20:43.969 --> 03:20:43.979 align:start position:0%
can't see that far away I apologize I
 
03:20:45.830 --> 03:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
keep talking I I would say it probably
 
03:20:50.170 --> 03:20:50.180 align:start position:0%
is but this is a very top level uh
 
03:20:53.690 --> 03:20:53.700 align:start position:0%
workflow and and you were being much
 
03:20:55.790 --> 03:20:55.800 align:start position:0%
more precise about all the branch
 
03:20:58.490 --> 03:20:58.500 align:start position:0%
conditions if this than this if this and
 
03:21:01.010 --> 03:21:01.020 align:start position:0%
that would and your your description was
 
03:21:02.929 --> 03:21:02.939 align:start position:0%
like within the Board of Medicine
 
03:21:05.809 --> 03:21:05.819 align:start position:0%
specifically what the workflow is and
 
03:21:07.490 --> 03:21:07.500 align:start position:0%
and that's what I'm really asking for
 
03:21:09.410 --> 03:21:09.420 align:start position:0%
because I think while this is a nice
 
03:21:11.809 --> 03:21:11.819 align:start position:0%
graphic it really doesn't get us very
 
03:21:14.690 --> 03:21:14.700 align:start position:0%
far yes I I can certainly provide that
 
03:21:16.490 --> 03:21:16.500 align:start position:0%
micro level detail
 
03:21:18.230 --> 03:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
um to you and I do believe we have a
 
03:21:19.849 --> 03:21:19.859 align:start position:0%
slide already that I can forward to
 
03:21:19.859 --> 03:21:22.849 align:start position:0%
slide already that I can forward to
representative

03:21:22.849 --> 03:21:22.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:25.070 --> 03:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
um that's it for my questions thank you
 
03:21:28.309 --> 03:21:28.319 align:start position:0%
I would however suggest that when
 
03:21:32.269 --> 03:21:32.279 align:start position:0%
a complaintant access is the board of
 
03:21:35.450 --> 03:21:35.460 align:start position:0%
medicine's website the complaintant is
 
03:21:39.769 --> 03:21:39.779 align:start position:0%
not just directed to oplc but there's a
 
03:21:44.210 --> 03:21:44.220 align:start position:0%
brief explanation that this is how the
 
03:21:45.950 --> 03:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
complaint will be heard and dealt with
 
03:21:48.469 --> 03:21:48.479 align:start position:0%
because I didn't see that and I'm saying
 
03:21:50.450 --> 03:21:50.460 align:start position:0%
how come it's going over there
 
03:21:53.330 --> 03:21:53.340 align:start position:0%
so a simple sentence I think would
 
03:21:53.340 --> 03:21:54.769 align:start position:0%
so a simple sentence I think would
alleviate

03:21:54.769 --> 03:21:54.779 align:start position:0%
alleviate
 
03:21:58.210 --> 03:21:58.220 align:start position:0%
um at least concerns like that certainly
 
03:22:00.769 --> 03:22:00.779 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I did think yeah go ahead okay
 
03:22:03.889 --> 03:22:03.899 align:start position:0%
so your your description of the workflow
 
03:22:06.889 --> 03:22:06.899 align:start position:0%
was pretty detailed and precise but what
 
03:22:10.849 --> 03:22:10.859 align:start position:0%
I did not hear was uh any feedback going
 
03:22:13.010 --> 03:22:13.020 align:start position:0%
to the original person who made the
 
03:22:15.650 --> 03:22:15.660 align:start position:0%
complaint and so if we were trying to
 
03:22:18.410 --> 03:22:18.420 align:start position:0%
build a closed-loop system whoever is
 
03:22:21.230 --> 03:22:21.240 align:start position:0%
initiating the process would also get
 
03:22:23.090 --> 03:22:23.100 align:start position:0%
some sort of feedback to let them know
 
03:22:25.010 --> 03:22:25.020 align:start position:0%
what the resolution was do you believe
 
03:22:28.429 --> 03:22:28.439 align:start position:0%
that we have that embedded in the in the
 
03:22:31.130 --> 03:22:31.140 align:start position:0%
web technology to give them feedback
 
03:22:33.290 --> 03:22:33.300 align:start position:0%
that the investigation has been complete
 
03:22:35.269 --> 03:22:35.279 align:start position:0%
and here's our determination
 
03:22:37.490 --> 03:22:37.500 align:start position:0%
so not in the technology and I think
 
03:22:38.750 --> 03:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
this is
 
03:22:38.760 --> 03:22:39.710 align:start position:0%
this is
um

03:22:39.710 --> 03:22:39.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:22:39.720 --> 03:22:41.690 align:start position:0%
um
a

03:22:41.690 --> 03:22:41.700 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:22:44.510 --> 03:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
a point that an issue that I think this
 
03:22:47.330 --> 03:22:47.340 align:start position:0%
legislature needs to consider so
 
03:22:47.340 --> 03:22:48.530 align:start position:0%
legislature needs to consider so
um

03:22:48.530 --> 03:22:48.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:22:51.530 --> 03:22:51.540 align:start position:0%
the statutes do not most statutes and
 
03:22:53.990 --> 03:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
they're all different but most statutes
 
03:22:56.090 --> 03:22:56.100 align:start position:0%
within our boards do not permit us to
 
03:22:58.849 --> 03:22:58.859 align:start position:0%
disclose information about an ongoing
 
03:23:01.610 --> 03:23:01.620 align:start position:0%
investigation to anyone including the
 
03:23:04.790 --> 03:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
complainant and so that
 
03:23:07.010 --> 03:23:07.020 align:start position:0%
um that is problematic
 
03:23:07.020 --> 03:23:07.729 align:start position:0%
um that is problematic
um

03:23:07.729 --> 03:23:07.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:23:10.429 --> 03:23:10.439 align:start position:0%
from a public protection standpoint
 
03:23:10.439 --> 03:23:12.610 align:start position:0%
from a public protection standpoint
consumer

03:23:12.610 --> 03:23:12.620 align:start position:0%
consumer
 
03:23:15.830 --> 03:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
providing good customer service we we
 
03:23:18.610 --> 03:23:18.620 align:start position:0%
are not permitted to give information
 
03:23:21.170 --> 03:23:21.180 align:start position:0%
unless and until there is a final
 
03:23:21.180 --> 03:23:22.670 align:start position:0%
unless and until there is a final
disposition

03:23:22.670 --> 03:23:22.680 align:start position:0%
disposition
 
03:23:26.090 --> 03:23:26.100 align:start position:0%
there are some exceptions to that in
 
03:23:28.130 --> 03:23:28.140 align:start position:0%
certain and I don't know the Board of
 
03:23:31.849 --> 03:23:31.859 align:start position:0%
Medicine off the top of my head if the
 
03:23:34.670 --> 03:23:34.680 align:start position:0%
prosecutor is going to be negotiating a
 
03:23:36.469 --> 03:23:36.479 align:start position:0%
settlement there is typically an
 
03:23:37.910 --> 03:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity for the complainant to
 
03:23:39.469 --> 03:23:39.479 align:start position:0%
comment on the settlement and certain
 
03:23:41.809 --> 03:23:41.819 align:start position:0%
board statutes that's not true for all
 
03:23:43.070 --> 03:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
of them
 
03:23:46.969 --> 03:23:46.979 align:start position:0%
so from my perspective uh it would be
 
03:23:50.330 --> 03:23:50.340 align:start position:0%
helpful for us to have the authority to
 
03:23:53.210 --> 03:23:53.220 align:start position:0%
be able to share at least procedural
 
03:23:55.070 --> 03:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
information with a complainant yeah we
 
03:23:56.510 --> 03:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
receive your complaint it's at this
 
03:23:58.729 --> 03:23:58.739 align:start position:0%
stage of the process
 
03:24:02.750 --> 03:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
um because that is the those are the
 
03:24:05.389 --> 03:24:05.399 align:start position:0%
more frequent inquiries we receive to
 
03:24:07.610 --> 03:24:07.620 align:start position:0%
our enforcement division
 
03:24:10.729 --> 03:24:10.739 align:start position:0%
do you have the authority now to go back
 
03:24:13.190 --> 03:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
to the complainant and say thank you so
 
03:24:14.990 --> 03:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
much for making a complaint
 
03:24:16.790 --> 03:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
we've received it yeah we can
 
03:24:19.370 --> 03:24:19.380 align:start position:0%
acknowledge receipt okay correct what we
 
03:24:21.469 --> 03:24:21.479 align:start position:0%
can't do is say you know somebody calls
 
03:24:23.030 --> 03:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
up and said oh it's been five months
 
03:24:25.010 --> 03:24:25.020 align:start position:0%
where is it on the process
 
03:24:27.769 --> 03:24:27.779 align:start position:0%
I can just say thank you yes we receive
 
03:24:29.990 --> 03:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
we have your complaint right and I
 
03:24:32.269 --> 03:24:32.279 align:start position:0%
wouldn't encourage uh in progress
 
03:24:35.030 --> 03:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
reviews back to the complaint but at
 
03:24:37.490 --> 03:24:37.500 align:start position:0%
some point the case is closed and the
 
03:24:40.010 --> 03:24:40.020 align:start position:0%
determination has been made so what I'm
 
03:24:42.290 --> 03:24:42.300 align:start position:0%
referring to is just closing it out with
 
03:24:44.090 --> 03:24:44.100 align:start position:0%
the complainant on what the final
 
03:24:46.550 --> 03:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
determination of their complaint was is
 
03:24:48.530 --> 03:24:48.540 align:start position:0%
is that possible do you have the
 
03:24:51.469 --> 03:24:51.479 align:start position:0%
authority to do that yes and we do so if
 
03:24:54.710 --> 03:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
the board decides to dismiss a case
 
03:24:57.410 --> 03:24:57.420 align:start position:0%
um two letters go out one goes to the
 
03:25:01.010 --> 03:25:01.020 align:start position:0%
physician one goes to the complainant
 
03:25:02.870 --> 03:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
um if the board decides to dismiss with
 
03:25:04.670 --> 03:25:04.680 align:start position:0%
a letter of concern the letter of
 
03:25:06.769 --> 03:25:06.779 align:start position:0%
concern goes to the physician and just a
 
03:25:08.389 --> 03:25:08.399 align:start position:0%
basic letter goes to the complainant
 
03:25:10.550 --> 03:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
that does not reference the letter of
 
03:25:11.929 --> 03:25:11.939 align:start position:0%
concern and then obviously if it
 
03:25:13.190 --> 03:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
proceeds to disciplinary they're
 
03:25:15.410 --> 03:25:15.420 align:start position:0%
notified you know notice of hearing is
 
03:25:15.420 --> 03:25:19.330 align:start position:0%
notified you know notice of hearing is
public

03:25:19.330 --> 03:25:19.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:22.070 --> 03:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
words in your mouth but as I I hear you
 
03:25:23.809 --> 03:25:23.819 align:start position:0%
talk through that whole closed loop
 
03:25:26.389 --> 03:25:26.399 align:start position:0%
system with a complaintant it sounds to
 
03:25:27.889 --> 03:25:27.899 align:start position:0%
me like you're saying that you believe
 
03:25:31.010 --> 03:25:31.020 align:start position:0%
it is adequate that it is it's supported
 
03:25:34.250 --> 03:25:34.260 align:start position:0%
and it's being uh supported yes I will
 
03:25:36.229 --> 03:25:36.239 align:start position:0%
say though that though there is a hole
 
03:25:37.849 --> 03:25:37.859 align:start position:0%
in that system
 
03:25:39.469 --> 03:25:39.479 align:start position:0%
um with respect to medical malpractice
 
03:25:43.070 --> 03:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
cases and with reports because
 
03:25:46.250 --> 03:25:46.260 align:start position:0%
we received an I can speak to this on
 
03:25:47.510 --> 03:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
different sides of being a former
 
03:25:49.130 --> 03:25:49.140 align:start position:0%
plaintiff's lawyer and being an
 
03:25:49.140 --> 03:25:50.330 align:start position:0%
plaintiff's lawyer and being an
administrative

03:25:50.330 --> 03:25:50.340 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
03:25:54.050 --> 03:25:54.060 align:start position:0%
um side when we received a complaint
 
03:25:55.849 --> 03:25:55.859 align:start position:0%
when the when the office receives a
 
03:25:57.710 --> 03:25:57.720 align:start position:0%
complaint a lawsuit that's been filed
 
03:25:59.210 --> 03:25:59.220 align:start position:0%
from the court
 
03:26:02.150 --> 03:26:02.160 align:start position:0%
the complainment is not considered to be
 
03:26:04.610 --> 03:26:04.620 align:start position:0%
the person who filed the lawsuit the
 
03:26:06.469 --> 03:26:06.479 align:start position:0%
complainant is the court
 
03:26:09.110 --> 03:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
and I can tell you from my perspective
 
03:26:11.630 --> 03:26:11.640 align:start position:0%
my former life that wasn't readily
 
03:26:13.250 --> 03:26:13.260 align:start position:0%
apparent to me
 
03:26:15.650 --> 03:26:15.660 align:start position:0%
um and I felt that I'm filing this
 
03:26:17.330 --> 03:26:17.340 align:start position:0%
lawsuit I should be considered the
 
03:26:18.530 --> 03:26:18.540 align:start position:0%
complainant and I'm going to be
 
03:26:20.809 --> 03:26:20.819 align:start position:0%
receiving some feedback that's not the
 
03:26:23.330 --> 03:26:23.340 align:start position:0%
case so
 
03:26:25.070 --> 03:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
um that would be the ones you know the
 
03:26:27.530 --> 03:26:27.540 align:start position:0%
type of circumstances in which the
 
03:26:30.410 --> 03:26:30.420 align:start position:0%
individual who filed a lawsuit would not
 
03:26:34.250 --> 03:26:34.260 align:start position:0%
receive any notification as to whether
 
03:26:38.210 --> 03:26:38.220 align:start position:0%
or not uh the case has been dismissed or
 
03:26:41.090 --> 03:26:41.100 align:start position:0%
has proceeded to disciplinary action and
 
03:26:43.130 --> 03:26:43.140 align:start position:0%
I don't think that connects with what
 
03:26:45.889 --> 03:26:45.899 align:start position:0%
the expectation is in the field and I'm
 
03:26:48.110 --> 03:26:48.120 align:start position:0%
sure others can can
 
03:26:52.510 --> 03:26:52.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:55.910 --> 03:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
okay so we're all here okay so um to
 
03:26:59.269 --> 03:26:59.279 align:start position:0%
play devil's advocate for the status quo
 
03:27:02.150 --> 03:27:02.160 align:start position:0%
um the the complaint in a malpractice
 
03:27:05.990 --> 03:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
case they will get their feedback uh or
 
03:27:09.710 --> 03:27:09.720 align:start position:0%
just or disposition based on how the
 
03:27:12.410 --> 03:27:12.420 align:start position:0%
court case that they initiated uh is
 
03:27:15.889 --> 03:27:15.899 align:start position:0%
determined they they haven't voiced an
 
03:27:18.969 --> 03:27:18.979 align:start position:0%
interest in having the physician
 
03:27:22.190 --> 03:27:22.200 align:start position:0%
disciplines what they're looking for is
 
03:27:25.610 --> 03:27:25.620 align:start position:0%
to be made whole again so so why would
 
03:27:28.370 --> 03:27:28.380 align:start position:0%
the Board of Medicine necessarily have a
 
03:27:30.950 --> 03:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
duty to inform somebody who initiated a
 
03:27:33.110 --> 03:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
lawsuit if they already know when the
 
03:27:35.750 --> 03:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
lawsuit's been concluded why why would
 
03:27:38.030 --> 03:27:38.040 align:start position:0%
they care what the Board of Medicine did
 
03:27:39.950 --> 03:27:39.960 align:start position:0%
with that information
 
03:27:42.290 --> 03:27:42.300 align:start position:0%
well I think because there is this
 
03:27:43.849 --> 03:27:43.859 align:start position:0%
expectation knowing that the court
 
03:27:46.190 --> 03:27:46.200 align:start position:0%
automatically forwards the complaint
 
03:27:49.550 --> 03:27:49.560 align:start position:0%
over to the office for consideration I
 
03:27:51.769 --> 03:27:51.779 align:start position:0%
think we received fewer consumer
 
03:27:53.450 --> 03:27:53.460 align:start position:0%
complaints that are arising at if not
 
03:27:54.889 --> 03:27:54.899 align:start position:0%
cases that are also leading to
 
03:27:57.650 --> 03:27:57.660 align:start position:0%
malpractice cases because there is that
 
03:27:59.630 --> 03:27:59.640 align:start position:0%
understanding that you know why would I
 
03:28:02.030 --> 03:28:02.040 align:start position:0%
duplicate efforts
 
03:28:02.040 --> 03:28:02.570 align:start position:0%
duplicate efforts
um

03:28:02.570 --> 03:28:02.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:28:05.750 --> 03:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
that's just my view of potentially what
 
03:28:07.790 --> 03:28:07.800 align:start position:0%
could be happening here and obviously we
 
03:28:10.250 --> 03:28:10.260 align:start position:0%
don't want to duplicate work
 
03:28:11.809 --> 03:28:11.819 align:start position:0%
um but I can tell you what I used to
 
03:28:16.729 --> 03:28:16.739 align:start position:0%
practice uh I had no idea that
 
03:28:19.010 --> 03:28:19.020 align:start position:0%
um that we you know that I was not being
 
03:28:20.750 --> 03:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
through you know my client was not being
 
03:28:22.849 --> 03:28:22.859 align:start position:0%
treated as the complainant
 
03:28:25.790 --> 03:28:25.800 align:start position:0%
um and you know I think if I had known
 
03:28:27.469 --> 03:28:27.479 align:start position:0%
that I probably would have purposely
 
03:28:29.210 --> 03:28:29.220 align:start position:0%
gone out of my way to our specifically
 
03:28:32.530 --> 03:28:32.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:36.469 --> 03:28:36.479 align:start position:0%
uh before I call on anyone else
 
03:28:39.950 --> 03:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
um he I wrote down if there's an
 
03:28:43.370 --> 03:28:43.380 align:start position:0%
emergency that is shuffled off to I
 
03:28:45.349 --> 03:28:45.359 align:start position:0%
don't mean that pejoratively it goes
 
03:28:48.769 --> 03:28:48.779 align:start position:0%
over to oplc you say the board chair of
 
03:28:51.170 --> 03:28:51.180 align:start position:0%
the Board of Medicine is notified and
 
03:28:56.210 --> 03:28:56.220 align:start position:0%
may then proceed and I want to nail that
 
03:29:00.309 --> 03:29:00.319 align:start position:0%
word down may not must
 
03:29:04.490 --> 03:29:04.500 align:start position:0%
if you deem it's to be an emergency
 
03:29:06.769 --> 03:29:06.779 align:start position:0%
and then they're notified
 
03:29:09.769 --> 03:29:09.779 align:start position:0%
right now they may go forward or they
 
03:29:11.269 --> 03:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
may not
 
03:29:12.950 --> 03:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
so that's one of the words we've been
 
03:29:15.290 --> 03:29:15.300 align:start position:0%
playing around with along the way I just
 
03:29:16.370 --> 03:29:16.380 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure I heard you
 
03:29:17.929 --> 03:29:17.939 align:start position:0%
correctly yes that's correct okay
 
03:29:20.870 --> 03:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
representative Weber I have a process
 
03:29:24.590 --> 03:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
question for the chair if I may it seems
 
03:29:27.590 --> 03:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
to me that we are re-plowing
 
03:29:30.950 --> 03:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
um ground that we have already plowed
 
03:29:36.469 --> 03:29:36.479 align:start position:0%
and I came today prepared to deal with a
 
03:29:39.469 --> 03:29:39.479 align:start position:0%
final report and it's my understanding
 
03:29:42.170 --> 03:29:42.180 align:start position:0%
that we now have several other people
 
03:29:44.269 --> 03:29:44.279 align:start position:0%
who are going to testify
 
03:29:47.110 --> 03:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
back to the process
 
03:29:51.469 --> 03:29:51.479 align:start position:0%
so I am wondering what your plan is for
 
03:29:54.410 --> 03:29:54.420 align:start position:0%
all of this and I'm going to
 
03:29:56.990 --> 03:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
um State you might need to leave it free
 
03:29:58.570 --> 03:29:58.580 align:start position:0%
of my apologies
 
03:30:01.130 --> 03:30:01.140 align:start position:0%
when that happens because it sounds to
 
03:30:03.590 --> 03:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
me we've got more than one meeting's
 
03:30:05.750 --> 03:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
worth of work if we're if we're starting
 
03:30:08.269 --> 03:30:08.279 align:start position:0%
over again for stuff that I think we've
 
03:30:11.690 --> 03:30:11.700 align:start position:0%
already heard a fair amount about
 
03:30:13.910 --> 03:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
yes and to answer your question that is
 
03:30:16.670 --> 03:30:16.680 align:start position:0%
what I intend to do is to reply and the
 
03:30:19.429 --> 03:30:19.439 align:start position:0%
reason for that is everybody
 
03:30:23.510 --> 03:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
or numbers of people stated what they
 
03:30:26.630 --> 03:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
wanted to say then they went off and
 
03:30:28.010 --> 03:30:28.020 align:start position:0%
thought about it because they hurt each
 
03:30:30.950 --> 03:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
other then they looked at at least three
 
03:30:32.990 --> 03:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
iterations of the report from
 
03:30:35.090 --> 03:30:35.100 align:start position:0%
representative Solway and now they're
 
03:30:37.550 --> 03:30:37.560 align:start position:0%
coming back with some more so yeah we
 
03:30:40.269 --> 03:30:40.279 align:start position:0%
kind of are redoing it
 
03:30:43.370 --> 03:30:43.380 align:start position:0%
and this will be the last meeting of
 
03:30:47.889 --> 03:30:47.899 align:start position:0%
this group I believe I think we're done
 
03:30:51.290 --> 03:30:51.300 align:start position:0%
and from this meeting I suspect some of
 
03:30:54.710 --> 03:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
us will want to work together on our own
 
03:30:57.889 --> 03:30:57.899 align:start position:0%
simply as legislators to craft an LSR
 
03:30:59.630 --> 03:30:59.640 align:start position:0%
based on this
 
03:31:01.729 --> 03:31:01.739 align:start position:0%
well thank you for that
 
03:31:01.739 --> 03:31:02.389 align:start position:0%
well thank you for that
um

03:31:02.389 --> 03:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:31:05.570 --> 03:31:05.580 align:start position:0%
any other questions for
 
03:31:09.349 --> 03:31:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:11.150 --> 03:31:11.160 align:start position:0%
well thank you and we'll look forward to
 
03:31:12.650 --> 03:31:12.660 align:start position:0%
that document thank you for your time
 
03:31:16.370 --> 03:31:16.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:25.250 --> 03:31:25.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:28.309 --> 03:31:28.319 align:start position:0%
and this one very important test hurdle
 
03:31:30.830 --> 03:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
you must pass
 
03:31:32.389 --> 03:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
and you're dead
 
03:31:36.530 --> 03:31:36.540 align:start position:0%
turning the mic on exactly perfect yeah
 
03:31:36.540 --> 03:31:37.190 align:start position:0%
turning the mic on exactly perfect yeah
um

03:31:37.190 --> 03:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:31:39.650 --> 03:31:39.660 align:start position:0%
I'm David Conway I'm a retired OB GYN

by oplc
 
03:31:48.650 --> 03:31:48.660 align:start position:0%
um I was
 
03:31:49.849 --> 03:31:49.859 align:start position:0%
a member of the medical review
 
03:31:53.510 --> 03:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
subcommittee from 2010 to 2016 and a
 
03:31:57.710 --> 03:31:57.720 align:start position:0%
member of the board from 2017 until this
 
03:31:59.990 --> 03:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
past May when I resigned to take this
 
03:32:00.000 --> 03:32:01.250 align:start position:0%
past May when I resigned to take this
position

03:32:01.250 --> 03:32:01.260 align:start position:0%
position
 
03:32:04.070 --> 03:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
at opl Seattle oplc
 
03:32:05.690 --> 03:32:05.700 align:start position:0%
but you were on the Board of Medicine
 
03:32:07.790 --> 03:32:07.800 align:start position:0%
yes president for the last year and a
 
03:32:07.800 --> 03:32:09.769 align:start position:0%
yes president for the last year and a
half

03:32:09.769 --> 03:32:09.779 align:start position:0%
half
 
03:32:13.210 --> 03:32:13.220 align:start position:0%
um to I'm sorry you are representative
 
03:32:15.950 --> 03:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
Edwards Edwards and I just want to
 
03:32:17.389 --> 03:32:17.399 align:start position:0%
address your question about the flow
 
03:32:17.399 --> 03:32:18.590 align:start position:0%
address your question about the flow
chart

03:32:18.590 --> 03:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
chart
 
03:32:20.690 --> 03:32:20.700 align:start position:0%
um you all should have a copy of it in
 
03:32:22.670 --> 03:32:22.680 align:start position:0%
your email and there are several copies
 
03:32:24.710 --> 03:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
floating around here this is your chart
 
03:32:27.410 --> 03:32:27.420 align:start position:0%
that's my tryout yep so so you heard
 
03:32:28.969 --> 03:32:28.979 align:start position:0%
that this is necessary but not
 
03:32:31.490 --> 03:32:31.500 align:start position:0%
sufficient she went into great detail
 
03:32:33.769 --> 03:32:33.779 align:start position:0%
that is sufficient for the process that
 
03:32:38.090 --> 03:32:38.100 align:start position:0%
I go through okay okay I believe
 
03:32:40.910 --> 03:32:40.920 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to kind of get to that
 
03:32:42.650 --> 03:32:42.660 align:start position:0%
after reading the draft or the oversight
 
03:32:45.229 --> 03:32:45.239 align:start position:0%
committee I want to clarify the process
 
03:32:47.570 --> 03:32:47.580 align:start position:0%
the board actually goes through to
 
03:32:48.950 --> 03:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
investigate consumer complaints
 
03:32:51.190 --> 03:32:51.200 align:start position:0%
complaints by other licensees
 
03:32:54.830 --> 03:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
lawsuits out-of-state actions and so on
 
03:32:56.990 --> 03:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
um I am no longer a member of the board
 
03:32:58.610 --> 03:32:58.620 align:start position:0%
I cannot I'm not here as a
 
03:33:00.950 --> 03:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
representative of the board uh simply as
 
03:33:03.050 --> 03:33:03.060 align:start position:0%
a an individual licensee who has a lot
 
03:33:04.910 --> 03:33:04.920 align:start position:0%
of experience with the investigations
 
03:33:07.610 --> 03:33:07.620 align:start position:0%
the board does
 
03:33:07.620 --> 03:33:08.330 align:start position:0%
the board does
um

03:33:08.330 --> 03:33:08.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:33:11.210 --> 03:33:11.220 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of talk about the May
 
03:33:13.550 --> 03:33:13.560 align:start position:0%
and shall investigate language and I
 
03:33:15.590 --> 03:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
want to emphasize that every single
 
03:33:17.929 --> 03:33:17.939 align:start position:0%
complaint whether it's a lawsuit whether
 
03:33:19.729 --> 03:33:19.739 align:start position:0%
it's Consumer complaint whatever
 
03:33:21.349 --> 03:33:21.359 align:start position:0%
is investigated
 
03:33:24.530 --> 03:33:24.540 align:start position:0%
and the process starts with a complaint
 
03:33:26.870 --> 03:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
coming into the board that's initially
 
03:33:29.450 --> 03:33:29.460 align:start position:0%
reviewed by an investigator there
 
03:33:33.710 --> 03:33:33.720 align:start position:0%
and in consultation with me I decide I
 
03:33:35.570 --> 03:33:35.580 align:start position:0%
basically triage that to determine is
 
03:33:37.550 --> 03:33:37.560 align:start position:0%
this an emergency
 
03:33:37.560 --> 03:33:38.929 align:start position:0%
this an emergency
um

03:33:38.929 --> 03:33:38.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:33:42.530 --> 03:33:42.540 align:start position:0%
is this no further action uh frivolous
 
03:33:44.510 --> 03:33:44.520 align:start position:0%
or unfounded
 
03:33:47.030 --> 03:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
if I make any of those determinations it
 
03:33:49.809 --> 03:33:49.819 align:start position:0%
goes directly to the board
 
03:33:53.210 --> 03:33:53.220 align:start position:0%
so that the chairman of the board can
 
03:33:54.849 --> 03:33:54.859 align:start position:0%
call an emergency
 
03:33:57.889 --> 03:33:57.899 align:start position:0%
a meeting for possible emergency
 
03:33:57.899 --> 03:34:00.229 align:start position:0%
a meeting for possible emergency
suspension

03:34:00.229 --> 03:34:00.239 align:start position:0%
suspension
 
03:34:00.239 --> 03:34:02.269 align:start position:0%
suspension
if

03:34:02.269 --> 03:34:02.279 align:start position:0%
if
 
03:34:04.910 --> 03:34:04.920 align:start position:0%
um any of those go to the board and they
 
03:34:07.070 --> 03:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
say no this is not an emergency this is
 
03:34:09.170 --> 03:34:09.180 align:start position:0%
not we don't think this is no further
 
03:34:10.790 --> 03:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
action there needs to be some
 
03:34:13.370 --> 03:34:13.380 align:start position:0%
investigation then it's sent to the
 
03:34:15.710 --> 03:34:15.720 align:start position:0%
medical review subcommittee to do a more
 
03:34:17.510 --> 03:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
in-depth investigation
 
03:34:20.510 --> 03:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
when that complaint initially comes in a
 
03:34:23.269 --> 03:34:23.279 align:start position:0%
response is required is requested from
 
03:34:26.750 --> 03:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
the licensee so that I am looking at the
 
03:34:28.969 --> 03:34:28.979 align:start position:0%
complaint that is in front of me as well
 
03:34:36.650 --> 03:34:36.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:36.660 --> 03:34:40.429 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:34:40.429 --> 03:34:40.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:43.010 --> 03:34:43.020 align:start position:0%
that you can read through the rest of
 
03:34:46.010 --> 03:34:46.020 align:start position:0%
this it should be in your mailboxes
 
03:34:46.020 --> 03:34:47.269 align:start position:0%
this it should be in your mailboxes
um

03:34:47.269 --> 03:34:47.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:50.450 --> 03:34:50.460 align:start position:0%
looking at the statistics from 2016 to
 
03:34:52.670 --> 03:34:52.680 align:start position:0%
2019 which were kept by a previous
 
03:34:52.680 --> 03:34:55.010 align:start position:0%
2019 which were kept by a previous
investigator

03:34:55.010 --> 03:34:55.020 align:start position:0%
investigator
 
03:34:57.429 --> 03:34:57.439 align:start position:0%
um roughly 80 percent were found to be
 
03:35:01.190 --> 03:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
unfounded or no further action 16 were
 
03:35:03.729 --> 03:35:03.739 align:start position:0%
letters of concern and three percent
 
03:35:08.929 --> 03:35:08.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:08.939 --> 03:35:09.830 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:35:09.830 --> 03:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:13.490 --> 03:35:13.500 align:start position:0%
Miss Courtney uh did go through the uh
 
03:35:15.530 --> 03:35:15.540 align:start position:0%
different steps that could be taken
 
03:35:17.510 --> 03:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
doctor because you are masked would you
 
03:35:19.550 --> 03:35:19.560 align:start position:0%
speak much closer to the mic please yes
 
03:35:29.870 --> 03:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:34.690 --> 03:35:34.700 align:start position:0%
and I'm sorry I'm just locating my place
 
03:35:36.650 --> 03:35:36.660 align:start position:0%
once it goes to the Medical Group
 
03:35:36.660 --> 03:35:38.150 align:start position:0%
once it goes to the Medical Group
subcommittee

03:35:38.150 --> 03:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
03:35:40.849 --> 03:35:40.859 align:start position:0%
um and is assigned to a member or to an
 
03:35:42.349 --> 03:35:42.359 align:start position:0%
outside reviewer if they're we need
 
03:35:44.030 --> 03:35:44.040 align:start position:0%
somebody who has more expertise than
 
03:35:45.050 --> 03:35:45.060 align:start position:0%
somebody on the medical view
 
03:35:48.550 --> 03:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
subcommittee uh report is
 
03:35:51.769 --> 03:35:51.779 align:start position:0%
generated that goes to the entire
 
03:35:53.990 --> 03:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
committee at the following meeting to
 
03:35:57.550 --> 03:35:57.560 align:start position:0%
decide uh whether it
 
03:36:00.170 --> 03:36:00.180 align:start position:0%
needs to be no further action whether it
 
03:36:02.510 --> 03:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
needs a letter of concern whether it
 
03:36:03.830 --> 03:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
needs discipline
 
03:36:05.750 --> 03:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
and that recommendation goes to the
 
03:36:05.760 --> 03:36:06.729 align:start position:0%
and that recommendation goes to the
board

03:36:06.729 --> 03:36:06.739 align:start position:0%
board
 
03:36:09.050 --> 03:36:09.060 align:start position:0%
and the board can either agree with that
 
03:36:11.630 --> 03:36:11.640 align:start position:0%
recommendation or recommend either
 
03:36:13.370 --> 03:36:13.380 align:start position:0%
lesser intervention or greater
 
03:36:13.380 --> 03:36:16.969 align:start position:0%
lesser intervention or greater
intervention

03:36:16.969 --> 03:36:16.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:16.979 --> 03:36:18.469 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:36:18.469 --> 03:36:18.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:20.929 --> 03:36:20.939 align:start position:0%
I did want to address
 
03:36:20.939 --> 03:36:23.150 align:start position:0%
I did want to address
um

03:36:23.150 --> 03:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:26.870 --> 03:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
some comments uh about
 
03:36:29.630 --> 03:36:29.640 align:start position:0%
listings settled malpractice lawsuits On
 
03:36:32.330 --> 03:36:32.340 align:start position:0%
The Board website and I don't think
 
03:36:34.250 --> 03:36:34.260 align:start position:0%
that's appropriate I think that it's an
 
03:36:35.710 --> 03:36:35.720 align:start position:0%
invasion of
 
03:36:40.309 --> 03:36:40.319 align:start position:0%
privacy where that lawsuit was found not
 
03:36:41.830 --> 03:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
to be
 
03:36:44.929 --> 03:36:44.939 align:start position:0%
the standard of care
 
03:36:44.939 --> 03:36:45.830 align:start position:0%
the standard of care
um

03:36:45.830 --> 03:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:48.469 --> 03:36:48.479 align:start position:0%
that lawsuits arise for a variety of
 
03:36:52.429 --> 03:36:52.439 align:start position:0%
reasons outside of their being poor
 
03:36:54.950 --> 03:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
practice just because it's a bad outcome
 
03:36:56.929 --> 03:36:56.939 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean there was bad medicine
 
03:36:59.570 --> 03:36:59.580 align:start position:0%
and there was some kind of examples that
 
03:37:01.910 --> 03:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
I stated initially at the last meeting
 
03:37:05.510 --> 03:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
as far as things that I experienced in
 
03:37:07.690 --> 03:37:07.700 align:start position:0%
my own practice as far as women
 
03:37:11.530 --> 03:37:11.540 align:start position:0%
presenting in advanced labor
 
03:37:15.530 --> 03:37:15.540 align:start position:0%
extremely premature with a baby that is
 
03:37:16.750 --> 03:37:16.760 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
03:37:20.690 --> 03:37:20.700 align:start position:0%
either not surviving or will have
 
03:37:24.010 --> 03:37:24.020 align:start position:0%
defects later on in development
 
03:37:27.290 --> 03:37:27.300 align:start position:0%
or severe shoulder distortions or
 
03:37:29.870 --> 03:37:29.880 align:start position:0%
someone who presents inactive labor with
 
03:37:32.510 --> 03:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
life-threatening bleeding
 
03:37:35.150 --> 03:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
um those are things that you have to
 
03:37:36.790 --> 03:37:36.800 align:start position:0%
take care of that
 
03:37:36.800 --> 03:37:37.370 align:start position:0%
take care of that
[Music]

03:37:37.370 --> 03:37:37.380 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:37:37.380 --> 03:37:38.570 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

03:37:38.570 --> 03:37:38.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:42.950 --> 03:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
can either go in uh very well or not
 
03:37:45.410 --> 03:37:45.420 align:start position:0%
well at all there are women there are
 
03:37:47.950 --> 03:37:47.960 align:start position:0%
patients whose ex patients are not met
 
03:37:50.330 --> 03:37:50.340 align:start position:0%
and patients who suffer known
 
03:37:52.389 --> 03:37:52.399 align:start position:0%
complications one has been adequate
 
03:37:55.490 --> 03:37:55.500 align:start position:0%
informed consent uh chairman Pearson
 
03:37:57.830 --> 03:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
raised the question of whether the oplc
 
03:37:59.210 --> 03:37:59.220 align:start position:0%
is the right place for submitting
 
03:38:01.250 --> 03:38:01.260 align:start position:0%
information and not only comment that
 
03:38:03.290 --> 03:38:03.300 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure and support that OPC
 
03:38:07.070 --> 03:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
oplc gives us is essential in order to
 
03:38:09.190 --> 03:38:09.200 align:start position:0%
do our job
 
03:38:12.349 --> 03:38:12.359 align:start position:0%
so finally regarding the proposed draft
 
03:38:14.809 --> 03:38:14.819 align:start position:0%
the board does currently inform the
 
03:38:16.790 --> 03:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
public of its actions regarding any
 
03:38:19.250 --> 03:38:19.260 align:start position:0%
provider misconduct which threatens the
 
03:38:21.769 --> 03:38:21.779 align:start position:0%
quality of care for well or well-being
 
03:38:24.410 --> 03:38:24.420 align:start position:0%
of patients the board does investigate
 
03:38:26.809 --> 03:38:26.819 align:start position:0%
any non-voluntary licensed revocations
 
03:38:29.929 --> 03:38:29.939 align:start position:0%
or suspensions out of state to determine
 
03:38:31.910 --> 03:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
if reciprocal discipline is warranted
 
03:38:34.670 --> 03:38:34.680 align:start position:0%
and if so that is also posted on the
 
03:38:34.680 --> 03:38:36.050 align:start position:0%
and if so that is also posted on the
website

03:38:36.050 --> 03:38:36.060 align:start position:0%
website
 
03:38:38.030 --> 03:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
the board does investigate any
 
03:38:40.150 --> 03:38:40.160 align:start position:0%
non-voluntary Hospital privilege
 
03:38:43.250 --> 03:38:43.260 align:start position:0%
revocations or suspensions to determine
 
03:38:45.710 --> 03:38:45.720 align:start position:0%
if discipline is warranted and if so
 
03:38:49.610 --> 03:38:49.620 align:start position:0%
that is also posted on the website
 
03:38:51.769 --> 03:38:51.779 align:start position:0%
um as I noted above the board does not
 
03:38:53.630 --> 03:38:53.640 align:start position:0%
simply report malpractice suits that are
 
03:38:56.630 --> 03:38:56.640 align:start position:0%
settled where the standard of care is
 
03:38:59.269 --> 03:38:59.279 align:start position:0%
met the board investigates those cases
 
03:39:00.950 --> 03:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
and determines the need for discipline
 
03:39:03.170 --> 03:39:03.180 align:start position:0%
and any discipline is posted on the
 
03:39:03.180 --> 03:39:05.210 align:start position:0%
and any discipline is posted on the
website

03:39:05.210 --> 03:39:05.220 align:start position:0%
website
 
03:39:05.220 --> 03:39:07.550 align:start position:0%
website
um

03:39:07.550 --> 03:39:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:09.830 --> 03:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
the board does currently report any New
 
03:39:11.389 --> 03:39:11.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire board actions on the website
 
03:39:13.309 --> 03:39:13.319 align:start position:0%
and investigates out of state board
 
03:39:14.929 --> 03:39:14.939 align:start position:0%
actions to determine the need for
 
03:39:17.090 --> 03:39:17.100 align:start position:0%
reciprocal discipline which is then
 
03:39:19.010 --> 03:39:19.020 align:start position:0%
posted on the website
 
03:39:21.650 --> 03:39:21.660 align:start position:0%
and I welcome any questions how many
 
03:39:23.570 --> 03:39:23.580 align:start position:0%
have been posted
 
03:39:27.229 --> 03:39:27.239 align:start position:0%
in the last oh say five to eight years
 
03:39:30.650 --> 03:39:30.660 align:start position:0%
because the initial Globe Spotlight team
 
03:39:33.590 --> 03:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
articles seem to indicate the answer is
 
03:39:35.690 --> 03:39:35.700 align:start position:0%
zero in New Hampshire
 
03:39:37.610 --> 03:39:37.620 align:start position:0%
you can go to the website and you can
 
03:39:41.090 --> 03:39:41.100 align:start position:0%
see all of the actions that the board
 
03:39:43.309 --> 03:39:43.319 align:start position:0%
has taken well I've not found them where
 
03:39:45.950 --> 03:39:45.960 align:start position:0%
are they that I'm missing them if you go
 
03:39:49.010 --> 03:39:49.020 align:start position:0%
if you look at the uh New Hampshire
 
03:39:51.010 --> 03:39:51.020 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine yeah
 
03:39:54.290 --> 03:39:54.300 align:start position:0%
you go down the list and it says board
 
03:39:56.750 --> 03:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
actions and it goes back I want to say
 
03:39:59.630 --> 03:39:59.640 align:start position:0%
10 or 15 years
 
03:40:04.070 --> 03:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
yeah I want to bring in an attorney
 
03:40:07.309 --> 03:40:07.319 align:start position:0%
Courtney okay two also don't go away we
 
03:40:09.710 --> 03:40:09.720 align:start position:0%
have a lot of mics here an engineer on
 
03:40:11.330 --> 03:40:11.340 align:start position:0%
Friday pointed that out to me I didn't
 
03:40:13.429 --> 03:40:13.439 align:start position:0%
know that I just want to clarify for the
 
03:40:15.950 --> 03:40:15.960 align:start position:0%
committee that the what is reported are
 
03:40:18.769 --> 03:40:18.779 align:start position:0%
board actions uh we don't we don't
 
03:40:21.710 --> 03:40:21.720 align:start position:0%
report malpractice payouts or claims
 
03:40:24.170 --> 03:40:24.180 align:start position:0%
unless they have resulted in abort
 
03:40:25.790 --> 03:40:25.800 align:start position:0%
action and what we report is the board
 
03:40:28.969 --> 03:40:28.979 align:start position:0%
action good I think that that protects
 
03:40:33.010 --> 03:40:33.020 align:start position:0%
the physician in the hospital from
 
03:40:36.050 --> 03:40:36.060 align:start position:0%
unwarranted inferences so that's good
 
03:40:39.229 --> 03:40:39.239 align:start position:0%
but I use do you know offhand
 
03:40:41.990 --> 03:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
um if we scroll down to board actions
 
03:40:44.570 --> 03:40:44.580 align:start position:0%
which I guess I haven't done about how
 
03:40:46.849 --> 03:40:46.859 align:start position:0%
many of them would there have been in
 
03:40:50.330 --> 03:40:50.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:51.830 --> 03:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
I can estimate it because I go through
 
03:40:54.170 --> 03:40:54.180 align:start position:0%
those on a regular basis that anywhere
 
03:40:59.090 --> 03:40:59.100 align:start position:0%
from probably 10 to 25 per year
 
03:41:03.050 --> 03:41:03.060 align:start position:0%
so so a number of us who investigated
 
03:41:05.030 --> 03:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
this apparently missed all that because
 
03:41:06.830 --> 03:41:06.840 align:start position:0%
the statement was made Massachusetts
 
03:41:12.110 --> 03:41:12.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:12.120 --> 03:41:13.370 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:41:13.370 --> 03:41:13.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:15.889 --> 03:41:15.899 align:start position:0%
statements about malpractice that were
 
03:41:18.349 --> 03:41:18.359 align:start position:0%
not specifically broken out to frivolous
 
03:41:19.910 --> 03:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
or warranted or whatever and New
 
03:41:21.710 --> 03:41:21.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire made none so it sounds like
 
03:41:24.229 --> 03:41:24.239 align:start position:0%
we're all missing the same thing
 
03:41:26.210 --> 03:41:26.220 align:start position:0%
if if I may
 
03:41:29.150 --> 03:41:29.160 align:start position:0%
what what Massachusetts is reporting and
 
03:41:31.250 --> 03:41:31.260 align:start position:0%
I assume I'm making an assumption here
 
03:41:33.530 --> 03:41:33.540 align:start position:0%
that they interface with the National
 
03:41:35.450 --> 03:41:35.460 align:start position:0%
Practitioner databake or or something
 
03:41:37.190 --> 03:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
where they grab the information
 
03:41:40.010 --> 03:41:40.020 align:start position:0%
regarding malpractice claims and payouts
 
03:41:41.690 --> 03:41:41.700 align:start position:0%
otherwise they would be manually
 
03:41:43.429 --> 03:41:43.439 align:start position:0%
entering that information as it's
 
03:41:43.439 --> 03:41:44.630 align:start position:0%
entering that information as it's
reported

03:41:44.630 --> 03:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
reported
 
03:41:46.849 --> 03:41:46.859 align:start position:0%
um they report information that are
 
03:41:48.950 --> 03:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
malpractice claims we do not we report
 
03:41:52.150 --> 03:41:52.160 align:start position:0%
board action so if there were 20K
 
03:41:55.070 --> 03:41:55.080 align:start position:0%
malpractice claims that were on the
 
03:41:56.929 --> 03:41:56.939 align:start position:0%
medicine website and there were zero in
 
03:42:00.830 --> 03:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
ours I think one can make the Assumption
 
03:42:03.410 --> 03:42:03.420 align:start position:0%
um that we didn't take any board actions
 
03:42:09.229 --> 03:42:09.239 align:start position:0%
that were the results of those claims
 
03:42:13.490 --> 03:42:13.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:16.269 --> 03:42:16.279 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if we're
 
03:42:18.469 --> 03:42:18.479 align:start position:0%
miscommunicating here because what I
 
03:42:21.469 --> 03:42:21.479 align:start position:0%
think that the chairman may be asking
 
03:42:25.250 --> 03:42:25.260 align:start position:0%
about is the specific case where there
 
03:42:27.290 --> 03:42:27.300 align:start position:0%
were 20
 
03:42:29.269 --> 03:42:29.279 align:start position:0%
um notes
 
03:42:33.729 --> 03:42:33.739 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts and none here and I'm
 
03:42:36.710 --> 03:42:36.720 align:start position:0%
thinking and I hope you will correct me
 
03:42:38.870 --> 03:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
if I'm wrong that the reason that those
 
03:42:41.389 --> 03:42:41.399 align:start position:0%
didn't show up here was either because
 
03:42:43.370 --> 03:42:43.380 align:start position:0%
as you've just said they were the kind
 
03:42:45.290 --> 03:42:45.300 align:start position:0%
of things that we don't normally report
 
03:42:50.290 --> 03:42:50.300 align:start position:0%
at this point or because
 
03:42:54.290 --> 03:42:54.300 align:start position:0%
that practitioner had left practice is
 
03:42:56.030 --> 03:42:56.040 align:start position:0%
that another reason why you might not
 
03:42:56.040 --> 03:42:57.410 align:start position:0%
that another reason why you might not
report

03:42:57.410 --> 03:42:57.420 align:start position:0%
report
 
03:42:59.750 --> 03:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
I I think I think it would be very
 
03:43:02.210 --> 03:43:02.220 align:start position:0%
helpful if you could
 
03:43:04.429 --> 03:43:04.439 align:start position:0%
um in addition to answering the question
 
03:43:06.170 --> 03:43:06.180 align:start position:0%
generally which is what I think you did
 
03:43:08.990 --> 03:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
if you are able to answer the question
 
03:43:11.269 --> 03:43:11.279 align:start position:0%
with respect to that specific case it
 
03:43:13.429 --> 03:43:13.439 align:start position:0%
would help us very much thank you thank
 
03:43:16.370 --> 03:43:16.380 align:start position:0%
you representative I cannot offer any
 
03:43:19.070 --> 03:43:19.080 align:start position:0%
specific information on that particular
 
03:43:22.250 --> 03:43:22.260 align:start position:0%
individual because the board did not
 
03:43:24.469 --> 03:43:24.479 align:start position:0%
take public disciplinary action against
 
03:43:26.769 --> 03:43:26.779 align:start position:0%
that individual what Massachusetts
 
03:43:29.389 --> 03:43:29.399 align:start position:0%
reports is not only their board
 
03:43:31.729 --> 03:43:31.739 align:start position:0%
decisions on disciplinary action but
 
03:43:34.250 --> 03:43:34.260 align:start position:0%
they also report General malpractice
 
03:43:37.370 --> 03:43:37.380 align:start position:0%
claims and payouts that second piece is
 
03:43:40.010 --> 03:43:40.020 align:start position:0%
something we do not report
 
03:43:40.020 --> 03:43:40.849 align:start position:0%
something we do not report
foreign

03:43:40.849 --> 03:43:40.859 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
03:43:43.790 --> 03:43:43.800 align:start position:0%
thank you that's very helpful
 
03:43:46.309 --> 03:43:46.319 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards I don't know who
 
03:43:48.710 --> 03:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
answers this it's on the uh the flow
 
03:43:51.530 --> 03:43:51.540 align:start position:0%
chart that we've all agreed that we have
 
03:43:54.670 --> 03:43:54.680 align:start position:0%
um there's I this is a nerd alert
 
03:43:58.490 --> 03:43:58.500 align:start position:0%
we have a line here an abandoned line
 
03:44:02.809 --> 03:44:02.819 align:start position:0%
that goes that's above Roi
 
03:44:05.269 --> 03:44:05.279 align:start position:0%
and Below Board of Medicine and it
 
03:44:08.090 --> 03:44:08.100 align:start position:0%
doesn't have an arrow it's got to have
 
03:44:11.630 --> 03:44:11.640 align:start position:0%
an arrow or people like me go insane
 
03:44:11.640 --> 03:44:13.969 align:start position:0%
an arrow or people like me go insane
hello

03:44:13.969 --> 03:44:13.979 align:start position:0%
hello
 
03:44:16.429 --> 03:44:16.439 align:start position:0%
um you can put the arrow going towards
 
03:44:18.889 --> 03:44:18.899 align:start position:0%
the Board of Medicine and I apologize
 
03:44:21.349 --> 03:44:21.359 align:start position:0%
for the typo no sweat
 
03:44:23.389 --> 03:44:23.399 align:start position:0%
um if I weren't OCD I wouldn't even
 
03:44:26.330 --> 03:44:26.340 align:start position:0%
noticed what what is an Roi in this case
 
03:44:28.309 --> 03:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
Board of Investigation
 
03:44:31.370 --> 03:44:31.380 align:start position:0%
that reported watch of Investigation
 
03:44:33.410 --> 03:44:33.420 align:start position:0%
okay thank you when a case goes to the
 
03:44:36.530 --> 03:44:36.540 align:start position:0%
mrsc a report is generated that
 
03:44:38.990 --> 03:44:39.000 align:start position:0%
describes the case uh describes the
 
03:44:42.490 --> 03:44:42.500 align:start position:0%
response of the licensee uh and it
 
03:44:46.130 --> 03:44:46.140 align:start position:0%
assessment made by the reviewer for
 
03:44:46.140 --> 03:44:48.950 align:start position:0%
assessment made by the reviewer for
recommendations

03:44:48.950 --> 03:44:48.960 align:start position:0%

03:44:52.729 --> 03:44:52.739 align:start position:0%
Pearson I also I just so you know I
 
03:44:54.950 --> 03:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
forwarded you the flowchart
 
03:44:57.349 --> 03:44:57.359 align:start position:0%
um that details a little bit
 
03:44:59.809 --> 03:44:59.819 align:start position:0%
um on a micro level the process that I
 
03:45:02.450 --> 03:45:02.460 align:start position:0%
outlined it's in your email inbox yes
 
03:45:05.150 --> 03:45:05.160 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Murphy thank
 
03:45:06.769 --> 03:45:06.779 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you once again
 
03:45:08.570 --> 03:45:08.580 align:start position:0%
for being here and testimony
 
03:45:09.950 --> 03:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
um I'm just trying to make it clear in
 
03:45:12.670 --> 03:45:12.680 align:start position:0%
my mind what is reported on the website
 
03:45:15.050 --> 03:45:15.060 align:start position:0%
unlike me and I understand that if it's
 
03:45:16.790 --> 03:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
a board action of any sort of
 
03:45:18.530 --> 03:45:18.540 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action that it ends up on
 
03:45:19.729 --> 03:45:19.739 align:start position:0%
the website
 
03:45:22.729 --> 03:45:22.739 align:start position:0%
so the two circumstances if you had a
 
03:45:25.150 --> 03:45:25.160 align:start position:0%
provider of any sort that had a
 
03:45:27.590 --> 03:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
malpractice suit settled for whatever
 
03:45:29.690 --> 03:45:29.700 align:start position:0%
reason but you found that there was no
 
03:45:29.700 --> 03:45:31.729 align:start position:0%
reason but you found that there was no
malpractice

03:45:31.729 --> 03:45:31.739 align:start position:0%
malpractice
 
03:45:33.349 --> 03:45:33.359 align:start position:0%
that does not show up on the website
 
03:45:35.690 --> 03:45:35.700 align:start position:0%
correct correct does it show up that
 
03:45:37.670 --> 03:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
they had a settlement or a malpractice
 
03:45:39.290 --> 03:45:39.300 align:start position:0%
suit in any way shape or form on the
 
03:45:41.630 --> 03:45:41.640 align:start position:0%
website no
 
03:45:45.969 --> 03:45:45.979 align:start position:0%
if you had a provider that had a
 
03:45:50.450 --> 03:45:50.460 align:start position:0%
malpractice suit that was actually found
 
03:45:53.030 --> 03:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
to be a true malpractice event quality
 
03:45:55.670 --> 03:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
of care ethical issues and a board of
 
03:45:57.290 --> 03:45:57.300 align:start position:0%
action is then taken that shows up on
 
03:45:59.929 --> 03:45:59.939 align:start position:0%
the website is there any other asterisk
 
03:46:01.849 --> 03:46:01.859 align:start position:0%
that said there was also an attendant to
 
03:46:04.190 --> 03:46:04.200 align:start position:0%
this a lawsuit that was settled or does
 
03:46:05.990 --> 03:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
lawsuit not show up at all on your
 
03:46:08.630 --> 03:46:08.640 align:start position:0%
website it does not show up okay thank
 
03:46:08.640 --> 03:46:09.530 align:start position:0%
website it does not show up okay thank
you

03:46:09.530 --> 03:46:09.540 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:46:12.110 --> 03:46:12.120 align:start position:0%
I I would add though that typically if
 
03:46:13.790 --> 03:46:13.800 align:start position:0%
it was the result if a board
 
03:46:15.469 --> 03:46:15.479 align:start position:0%
disciplinary decision was the result of
 
03:46:17.330 --> 03:46:17.340 align:start position:0%
a lawsuit that when you read The
 
03:46:19.729 --> 03:46:19.739 align:start position:0%
Narrative order it likely will include
 
03:46:23.090 --> 03:46:23.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:26.450 --> 03:46:26.460 align:start position:0%
what level of discipline is needed
 
03:46:29.210 --> 03:46:29.220 align:start position:0%
before it will show up
 
03:46:31.130 --> 03:46:31.140 align:start position:0%
there are several forms of discipline
 
03:46:34.790 --> 03:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
they all show up one is a reprimand
 
03:46:39.170 --> 03:46:39.180 align:start position:0%
one is revocation one is suspension or
 
03:46:42.050 --> 03:46:42.060 align:start position:0%
temporary loss of license uh
 
03:46:44.510 --> 03:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
uh also providers can be required to
 
03:46:48.229 --> 03:46:48.239 align:start position:0%
take continuing Medica medical education
 
03:46:48.239 --> 03:46:50.570 align:start position:0%
take continuing Medica medical education
uh

03:46:50.570 --> 03:46:50.580 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:46:52.610 --> 03:46:52.620 align:start position:0%
I believe there could be a fine you gave
 
03:46:58.070 --> 03:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:01.550 --> 03:47:01.560 align:start position:0%
um suspension or is there a category of
 
03:47:04.010 --> 03:47:04.020 align:start position:0%
light duties like you are still allowed
 
03:47:07.130 --> 03:47:07.140 align:start position:0%
to practice but what is that called
 
03:47:11.809 --> 03:47:11.819 align:start position:0%
a restriction a restriction uh we could
 
03:47:16.370 --> 03:47:16.380 align:start position:0%
require a proctor if a surgeon is has
 
03:47:19.429 --> 03:47:19.439 align:start position:0%
has multiple complications we could
 
03:47:23.110 --> 03:47:23.120 align:start position:0%
require that he or she be proctored for
 
03:47:26.630 --> 03:47:26.640 align:start position:0%
any further surgery is there a day it
 
03:47:29.750 --> 03:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
must like 30 days um greater or even
 
03:47:32.590 --> 03:47:32.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:35.090 --> 03:47:35.100 align:start position:0%
I am not sure
 
03:47:38.030 --> 03:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
um likely it's uh it would be included
 
03:47:41.050 --> 03:47:41.060 align:start position:0%
in the order that the final order that
 
03:47:45.530 --> 03:47:45.540 align:start position:0%
delineates the uh uh the discipline as
 
03:47:47.269 --> 03:47:47.279 align:start position:0%
far as when it needs to
 
03:47:47.279 --> 03:47:47.990 align:start position:0%
far as when it needs to
um

03:47:47.990 --> 03:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:47:49.910 --> 03:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
go into effect
 
03:47:52.550 --> 03:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
so I should then be able to go on to the
 
03:47:55.429 --> 03:47:55.439 align:start position:0%
website and
 
03:47:55.439 --> 03:47:56.210 align:start position:0%
website and
um

03:47:56.210 --> 03:47:56.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:47:59.510 --> 03:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
scroll down to board actions
 
03:48:02.349 --> 03:48:02.359 align:start position:0%
would the board action
 
03:48:07.190 --> 03:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
list a hospital action
 
03:48:11.210 --> 03:48:11.220 align:start position:0%
only it's done in-house somebody's on
 
03:48:12.769 --> 03:48:12.779 align:start position:0%
restricted duties
 
03:48:14.929 --> 03:48:14.939 align:start position:0%
with the board would have to be notified
 
03:48:17.630 --> 03:48:17.640 align:start position:0%
by the institution okay so the hospital
 
03:48:20.150 --> 03:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
would then officially
 
03:48:21.830 --> 03:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
I don't mean you heard it on the great
 
03:48:25.309 --> 03:48:25.319 align:start position:0%
fire the hospital would officially have
 
03:48:29.090 --> 03:48:29.100 align:start position:0%
to notify the board yes that they did
 
03:48:32.090 --> 03:48:32.100 align:start position:0%
this in-house and if they don't notify
 
03:48:35.630 --> 03:48:35.640 align:start position:0%
you folks then it it's still you don't
 
03:48:38.150 --> 03:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
know it correct okay thank you
 
03:48:40.250 --> 03:48:40.260 align:start position:0%
representative soloway
 
03:48:42.950 --> 03:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman Dr Conway welcome
 
03:48:44.990 --> 03:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
back uh let me wish you a happy
 
03:48:45.000 --> 03:48:46.550 align:start position:0%
back uh let me wish you a happy
Halloween

03:48:46.550 --> 03:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
Halloween
 
03:48:50.269 --> 03:48:50.279 align:start position:0%
um so if I get this right and I need
 
03:48:51.950 --> 03:48:51.960 align:start position:0%
your input on this
 
03:48:57.050 --> 03:48:57.060 align:start position:0%
the term disciplinary action may require
 
03:48:59.330 --> 03:48:59.340 align:start position:0%
some definition
 
03:49:03.670 --> 03:49:03.680 align:start position:0%
so for example a disciplinary action
 
03:49:06.790 --> 03:49:06.800 align:start position:0%
within a Health Care Organization
 
03:49:10.389 --> 03:49:10.399 align:start position:0%
might include for example
 
03:49:13.910 --> 03:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
suspension of privileges restriction of
 
03:49:17.510 --> 03:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
privileges proctoring mentoring and so
 
03:49:21.889 --> 03:49:21.899 align:start position:0%
forth but this may not reach the level
 
03:49:26.870 --> 03:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
of reportability to the board though
 
03:49:29.570 --> 03:49:29.580 align:start position:0%
that might be considered a disciplinary
 
03:49:29.580 --> 03:49:30.950 align:start position:0%
that might be considered a disciplinary
action

03:49:30.950 --> 03:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
action
 
03:49:33.410 --> 03:49:33.420 align:start position:0%
secondly if I may
 
03:49:37.790 --> 03:49:37.800 align:start position:0%
if there were to be a settled lawsuit
 
03:49:41.889 --> 03:49:41.899 align:start position:0%
and insurer May exert its own
 
03:49:44.870 --> 03:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action by suspending
 
03:49:47.990 --> 03:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
malpractice insurance by increasing the
 
03:49:50.269 --> 03:49:50.279 align:start position:0%
premium for that malpractice insurance
 
03:49:53.510 --> 03:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
and this would also be a disciplinary
 
03:49:57.349 --> 03:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
action not reportable to the board and
 
03:49:59.690 --> 03:49:59.700 align:start position:0%
as I if I get this right and I need your
 
03:50:04.429 --> 03:50:04.439 align:start position:0%
input the only disciplinary actions that
 
03:50:07.370 --> 03:50:07.380 align:start position:0%
get reported to the public are the
 
03:50:11.210 --> 03:50:11.220 align:start position:0%
disciplinary actions that are determined
 
03:50:16.090 --> 03:50:16.100 align:start position:0%
by the Board of Medicine in response to
 
03:50:18.889 --> 03:50:18.899 align:start position:0%
complaints these other forms of
 
03:50:21.469 --> 03:50:21.479 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action are not reportable
 
03:50:24.110 --> 03:50:24.120 align:start position:0%
is that correct correct I have that all
 
03:50:24.120 --> 03:50:25.309 align:start position:0%
is that correct correct I have that all
right

03:50:25.309 --> 03:50:25.319 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:50:27.769 --> 03:50:27.779 align:start position:0%
that's how we've done it for a long time
 
03:50:30.349 --> 03:50:30.359 align:start position:0%
yes thank you that's what's required in
 
03:50:32.510 --> 03:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
the statute thank you representative
 
03:50:34.670 --> 03:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
Murphy thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
03:50:36.170 --> 03:50:36.180 align:start position:0%
again Dr Conley
 
03:50:38.570 --> 03:50:38.580 align:start position:0%
um just a question of the lens available
 
03:50:41.510 --> 03:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
to the Board of Medicine
 
03:50:45.229 --> 03:50:45.239 align:start position:0%
unless you uh so a superior court has to
 
03:50:48.469 --> 03:50:48.479 align:start position:0%
report filing of any medical injury a
 
03:50:50.570 --> 03:50:50.580 align:start position:0%
hospital has to report to you any
 
03:50:53.030 --> 03:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action revocation of
 
03:50:55.370 --> 03:50:55.380 align:start position:0%
privileges or limitation or privileges
 
03:50:57.950 --> 03:50:57.960 align:start position:0%
correct a State Medical Society would
 
03:50:59.750 --> 03:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
have to report to you by Statute any
 
03:51:02.929 --> 03:51:02.939 align:start position:0%
limitations and privileges or licensing
 
03:51:04.309 --> 03:51:04.319 align:start position:0%
etc etc right
 
03:51:06.050 --> 03:51:06.060 align:start position:0%
I don't know about the medical society
 
03:51:08.570 --> 03:51:08.580 align:start position:0%
so what I'm trying to say if if it was
 
03:51:11.030 --> 03:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
if it's not for a patient complaint or
 
03:51:13.790 --> 03:51:13.800 align:start position:0%
family patient complaint you would not
 
03:51:17.690 --> 03:51:17.700 align:start position:0%
be aware of any problematic behavior in
 
03:51:19.429 --> 03:51:19.439 align:start position:0%
a hospital a multi-specialty clinic
 
03:51:21.349 --> 03:51:21.359 align:start position:0%
unless there was some disciplinary
 
03:51:23.510 --> 03:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
action within the hospital or the
 
03:51:24.830 --> 03:51:24.840 align:start position:0%
multi-specialty clinic is that correct
 
03:51:26.750 --> 03:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
because they're not report they're not
 
03:51:29.389 --> 03:51:29.399 align:start position:0%
required to report entirely the
 
03:51:32.389 --> 03:51:32.399 align:start position:0%
disruptive Physicians who could be
 
03:51:34.729 --> 03:51:34.739 align:start position:0%
reported to the Board of Medicine
 
03:51:36.590 --> 03:51:36.600 align:start position:0%
but are they required from the hospital
 
03:51:38.929 --> 03:51:38.939 align:start position:0%
to report you know if there's any
 
03:51:41.090 --> 03:51:41.100 align:start position:0%
suspension of privileges if they did not
 
03:51:43.370 --> 03:51:43.380 align:start position:0%
do that do they are they required to
 
03:51:45.469 --> 03:51:45.479 align:start position:0%
show that to report to you there's I
 
03:51:47.450 --> 03:51:47.460 align:start position:0%
would say no that if there's no action
 
03:51:49.670 --> 03:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
to affect their uh and I think believe
 
03:51:52.130 --> 03:51:52.140 align:start position:0%
Mr Anand is here and he can testify to
 
03:51:52.140 --> 03:51:53.050 align:start position:0%
Mr Anand is here and he can testify to
that

03:51:53.050 --> 03:51:53.060 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:51:56.750 --> 03:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
that if there's no action against that
 
03:51:59.450 --> 03:51:59.460 align:start position:0%
Physician's uh privileges then the
 
03:52:02.269 --> 03:52:02.279 align:start position:0%
answer would be no you would not see it
 
03:52:05.929 --> 03:52:05.939 align:start position:0%
correct okay let me try to clarify that
 
03:52:07.849 --> 03:52:07.859 align:start position:0%
again I'm the token liberal arts here
 
03:52:09.410 --> 03:52:09.420 align:start position:0%
which is why we have to do these things
 
03:52:11.150 --> 03:52:11.160 align:start position:0%
three times
 
03:52:11.160 --> 03:52:11.990 align:start position:0%
three times
um

03:52:11.990 --> 03:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:52:16.010 --> 03:52:16.020 align:start position:0%
let's say a hospital puts a physician on
 
03:52:19.790 --> 03:52:19.800 align:start position:0%
a restriction for 20 days 26 days
 
03:52:19.800 --> 03:52:21.830 align:start position:0%
a restriction for 20 days 26 days
whatever

03:52:21.830 --> 03:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
03:52:23.929 --> 03:52:23.939 align:start position:0%
I know the hospital Association will be
 
03:52:25.969 --> 03:52:25.979 align:start position:0%
far better able to answer this and
 
03:52:27.050 --> 03:52:27.060 align:start position:0%
they're going to be coming up pretty
 
03:52:27.060 --> 03:52:28.190 align:start position:0%
they're going to be coming up pretty
soon

03:52:28.190 --> 03:52:28.200 align:start position:0%
soon
 
03:52:30.710 --> 03:52:30.720 align:start position:0%
are they required
 
03:52:32.990 --> 03:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
to notify
 
03:52:33.000 --> 03:52:34.790 align:start position:0%
to notify
you

03:52:34.790 --> 03:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:52:37.729 --> 03:52:37.739 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine oplc if they put
 
03:52:40.729 --> 03:52:40.739 align:start position:0%
someone that works there on restriction
 
03:52:43.070 --> 03:52:43.080 align:start position:0%
what I understand is yes
 
03:52:45.229 --> 03:52:45.239 align:start position:0%
they are if they've restricted that
 
03:52:50.330 --> 03:52:50.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:50.340 --> 03:52:51.710 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:52:51.710 --> 03:52:51.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:52:55.130 --> 03:52:55.140 align:start position:0%
then presumably the last time a
 
03:52:57.889 --> 03:52:57.899 align:start position:0%
physician or surgeon was thus
 
03:52:57.899 --> 03:52:59.570 align:start position:0%
physician or surgeon was thus
disciplined

03:52:59.570 --> 03:52:59.580 align:start position:0%
disciplined
 
03:53:03.349 --> 03:53:03.359 align:start position:0%
you folks knew it you were told it
 
03:53:09.050 --> 03:53:09.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:13.190 --> 03:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:15.110 --> 03:53:15.120 align:start position:0%
a little coaching
 
03:53:18.530 --> 03:53:18.540 align:start position:0%
uh could you repeat your question
 
03:53:21.349 --> 03:53:21.359 align:start position:0%
if a physician or surgeon that works at
 
03:53:22.910 --> 03:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
a particular Hospital
 
03:53:25.010 --> 03:53:25.020 align:start position:0%
was disciplined by that hospital let's
 
03:53:27.830 --> 03:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
say put on a 20-day restriction
 
03:53:29.150 --> 03:53:29.160 align:start position:0%
um you have to have a proctor in the
 
03:53:31.429 --> 03:53:31.439 align:start position:0%
room or something yeah
 
03:53:33.710 --> 03:53:33.720 align:start position:0%
must they
 
03:53:35.990 --> 03:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
inform the Board of Medicine
 
03:53:38.389 --> 03:53:38.399 align:start position:0%
they need to form the board into the mic
 
03:53:40.490 --> 03:53:40.500 align:start position:0%
close they need to inform the Board of
 
03:53:44.030 --> 03:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
Medicine who then decides do we need to
 
03:53:49.389 --> 03:53:49.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:51.590 --> 03:53:51.600 align:start position:0%
so it could be
 
03:53:53.630 --> 03:53:53.640 align:start position:0%
that somebody's under a certain level of
 
03:53:55.729 --> 03:53:55.739 align:start position:0%
discipline at a local hospital
 
03:53:57.170 --> 03:53:57.180 align:start position:0%
and because the Board of Medicine
 
03:53:59.510 --> 03:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
chooses not to go any further
 
03:54:02.030 --> 03:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
the public doesn't hear about it
 
03:54:07.070 --> 03:54:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:09.349 --> 03:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming a local hospital does not
 
03:54:11.450 --> 03:54:11.460 align:start position:0%
have a place where they report who's
 
03:54:14.990 --> 03:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:17.150 --> 03:54:17.160 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent question I would
 
03:54:20.030 --> 03:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
have to repeat my answer that if a
 
03:54:21.950 --> 03:54:21.960 align:start position:0%
physician's privileges are restricted
 
03:54:24.650 --> 03:54:24.660 align:start position:0%
the board has to decide has to be
 
03:54:27.769 --> 03:54:27.779 align:start position:0%
informed and has to decide if they need
 
03:54:31.610 --> 03:54:31.620 align:start position:0%
to impose any kind of discipline thank
 
03:54:31.620 --> 03:54:36.490 align:start position:0%
to impose any kind of discipline thank
you

03:54:36.490 --> 03:54:36.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:38.330 --> 03:54:38.340 align:start position:0%
one more time
 
03:54:42.050 --> 03:54:42.060 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm with the logical flow here
 
03:54:45.830 --> 03:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
that the hospitals must report any sort
 
03:54:47.929 --> 03:54:47.939 align:start position:0%
of disciplinary or restrictions to the
 
03:54:50.510 --> 03:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:53.330 --> 03:54:53.340 align:start position:0%
if the Board of Medicine receives a
 
03:54:55.790 --> 03:54:55.800 align:start position:0%
report from the hospital saying there
 
03:54:57.550 --> 03:54:57.560 align:start position:0%
has been a restriction
 
03:55:00.550 --> 03:55:00.560 align:start position:0%
it sounds like the Board of Medicine
 
03:55:03.070 --> 03:55:03.080 align:start position:0%
hasn't its discretion
 
03:55:07.250 --> 03:55:07.260 align:start position:0%
the ability to choose to Echo that
 
03:55:11.210 --> 03:55:11.220 align:start position:0%
restriction and and repeat it or to let
 
03:55:15.110 --> 03:55:15.120 align:start position:0%
it lie if they leave it alone it does
 
03:55:17.090 --> 03:55:17.100 align:start position:0%
not become reportable because the Board
 
03:55:20.150 --> 03:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
of Medicine took no action
 
03:55:24.830 --> 03:55:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:27.110 --> 03:55:27.120 align:start position:0%
I I didn't hear you I'm sorry no
 
03:55:31.550 --> 03:55:31.560 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action no okay so so I'm
 
03:55:32.929 --> 03:55:32.939 align:start position:0%
struggling with this because this
 
03:55:35.090 --> 03:55:35.100 align:start position:0%
doesn't pass the common sense test to me
 
03:55:38.750 --> 03:55:38.760 align:start position:0%
it seems to me if a hospital has
 
03:55:41.870 --> 03:55:41.880 align:start position:0%
rendered restrictions of duties or
 
03:55:44.030 --> 03:55:44.040 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action whatever term you
 
03:55:46.070 --> 03:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
want to use there
 
03:55:49.130 --> 03:55:49.140 align:start position:0%
that that becomes of interest to the
 
03:55:52.490 --> 03:55:52.500 align:start position:0%
public and it seems like even if the
 
03:55:55.250 --> 03:55:55.260 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine we're just behaving
 
03:55:57.769 --> 03:55:57.779 align:start position:0%
like a bull fighter and waving the bull
 
03:56:00.410 --> 03:56:00.420 align:start position:0%
through the cape you would still want to
 
03:56:03.290 --> 03:56:03.300 align:start position:0%
report to the public that a lot of bull
 
03:56:06.290 --> 03:56:06.300 align:start position:0%
is coming through so I'm sorry I used to
 
03:56:09.530 --> 03:56:09.540 align:start position:0%
push that analogy too far I Blame You Mr
 
03:56:13.070 --> 03:56:13.080 align:start position:0%
chair uh okay but and but so we're not
 
03:56:15.830 --> 03:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
so it's it seems to me like there's a
 
03:56:17.929 --> 03:56:17.939 align:start position:0%
gap in what I would consider the common
 
03:56:19.450 --> 03:56:19.460 align:start position:0%
sense test
 
03:56:22.130 --> 03:56:22.140 align:start position:0%
are you hearing me do you agree with me
 
03:56:24.710 --> 03:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
do you disagree I see a representative
 
03:56:28.010 --> 03:56:28.020 align:start position:0%
or excuse me uh is Courtney nodding in
 
03:56:30.170 --> 03:56:30.180 align:start position:0%
the back so you seem to think what I'm
 
03:56:33.170 --> 03:56:33.180 align:start position:0%
saying makes sense do you want to
 
03:56:35.750 --> 03:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
comment on it
 
03:56:35.760 --> 03:56:42.349 align:start position:0%
comment on it
foreign

03:56:42.349 --> 03:56:42.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:45.889 --> 03:56:45.899 align:start position:0%
I would just say that there are the
 
03:56:47.750 --> 03:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine like all regulatory
 
03:56:49.809 --> 03:56:49.819 align:start position:0%
boards has the discretion whether or not
 
03:56:52.490 --> 03:56:52.500 align:start position:0%
to and this I think is consistent with
 
03:56:54.650 --> 03:56:54.660 align:start position:0%
what Dr Baker testified to at the first
 
03:56:56.750 --> 03:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
hearing they have discretion to decide
 
03:56:58.070 --> 03:56:58.080 align:start position:0%
whether or not to take disciplinary
 
03:57:01.250 --> 03:57:01.260 align:start position:0%
action even if on its face the
 
03:57:01.260 --> 03:57:02.689 align:start position:0%
action even if on its face the
allegations

03:57:02.689 --> 03:57:02.699 align:start position:0%
allegations
 
03:57:06.349 --> 03:57:06.359 align:start position:0%
um are facially valid so certainly there
 
03:57:08.990 --> 03:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
could be circumstances in which a
 
03:57:12.290 --> 03:57:12.300 align:start position:0%
hospital chooses to take action
 
03:57:17.590 --> 03:57:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:22.189 --> 03:57:22.199 align:start position:0%
could I answer so what would be
 
03:57:24.950 --> 03:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
the disadvantages or the problems in
 
03:57:27.590 --> 03:57:27.600 align:start position:0%
your view Miss Courtney if the
 
03:57:30.830 --> 03:57:30.840 align:start position:0%
legislature were to mandate that any
 
03:57:34.309 --> 03:57:34.319 align:start position:0%
Hospital disciplinary action even if the
 
03:57:36.650 --> 03:57:36.660 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine chooses not to to
 
03:57:39.889 --> 03:57:39.899 align:start position:0%
layer upon their own action that they
 
03:57:42.170 --> 03:57:42.180 align:start position:0%
still had a duty to report to the public
 
03:57:45.590 --> 03:57:45.600 align:start position:0%
the hospital's initial action even
 
03:57:47.450 --> 03:57:47.460 align:start position:0%
though the Board of Medicine chose to do
 
03:57:50.030 --> 03:57:50.040 align:start position:0%
nothing why why should we not mandate
 
03:57:50.040 --> 03:57:52.729 align:start position:0%
nothing why why should we not mandate
that

03:57:52.729 --> 03:57:52.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:54.889 --> 03:57:54.899 align:start position:0%
or should we I mean so under your
 
03:57:54.899 --> 03:57:56.570 align:start position:0%
or should we I mean so under your
scenario

03:57:56.570 --> 03:57:56.580 align:start position:0%
scenario
 
03:57:59.349 --> 03:57:59.359 align:start position:0%
whether or not the board took action
 
03:58:01.910 --> 03:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
the board would be required to report
 
03:58:04.010 --> 03:58:04.020 align:start position:0%
the information that the hospital took I
 
03:58:07.070 --> 03:58:07.080 align:start position:0%
guess that's that's
 
03:58:10.010 --> 03:58:10.020 align:start position:0%
it I I don't know that I can comment on
 
03:58:11.990 --> 03:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
that I think I would need to think that
 
03:58:12.000 --> 03:58:13.610 align:start position:0%
that I think I would need to think that
through

03:58:13.610 --> 03:58:13.620 align:start position:0%
through
 
03:58:15.830 --> 03:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
um I think the question you pose is are
 
03:58:17.689 --> 03:58:17.699 align:start position:0%
there any valid circumstances under
 
03:58:20.269 --> 03:58:20.279 align:start position:0%
which that a hospital would would take
 
03:58:23.150 --> 03:58:23.160 align:start position:0%
action and the board would not
 
03:58:25.790 --> 03:58:25.800 align:start position:0%
I I also can't answer that question
 
03:58:25.800 --> 03:58:26.870 align:start position:0%
I I also can't answer that question
either

03:58:26.870 --> 03:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
either
 
03:58:29.030 --> 03:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
could I add to the conversation so Dr
 
03:58:31.250 --> 03:58:31.260 align:start position:0%
Conway if you would not
 
03:58:33.710 --> 03:58:33.720 align:start position:0%
so for instance if there was a
 
03:58:35.929 --> 03:58:35.939 align:start position:0%
disruptive physician who
 
03:58:38.870 --> 03:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
um was not interacting with other staff
 
03:58:40.610 --> 03:58:40.620 align:start position:0%
members at a hospital
 
03:58:43.610 --> 03:58:43.620 align:start position:0%
over a fairly brief amount of time and
 
03:58:46.250 --> 03:58:46.260 align:start position:0%
the hospital chose to suspend them for X
 
03:58:49.010 --> 03:58:49.020 align:start position:0%
number of days or weeks uh whatever that
 
03:58:51.950 --> 03:58:51.960 align:start position:0%
had to be that has to be reported to
 
03:58:51.960 --> 03:58:52.550 align:start position:0%
had to be that has to be reported to
um

03:58:52.550 --> 03:58:52.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:55.790 --> 03:58:55.800 align:start position:0%
the board for investigation during that
 
03:58:55.800 --> 03:58:57.110 align:start position:0%
the board for investigation during that
investigation

03:58:57.110 --> 03:58:57.120 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
03:59:00.349 --> 03:59:00.359 align:start position:0%
if it turned out that this provider was
 
03:59:02.090 --> 03:59:02.100 align:start position:0%
going through a divorce had had death in
 
03:59:04.670 --> 03:59:04.680 align:start position:0%
the family any number of things that
 
03:59:06.170 --> 03:59:06.180 align:start position:0%
increased stress
 
03:59:08.870 --> 03:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
a pandemic for instance
 
03:59:11.030 --> 03:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
um then and this was the first time that
 
03:59:12.530 --> 03:59:12.540 align:start position:0%
this physician had come before the board
 
03:59:15.590 --> 03:59:15.600 align:start position:0%
the board could say okay you have
 
03:59:17.630 --> 03:59:17.640 align:start position:0%
violated the statute and the board has
 
03:59:20.150 --> 03:59:20.160 align:start position:0%
chosen not to discipline you and that
 
03:59:23.150 --> 03:59:23.160 align:start position:0%
goes out as a letter of concern
 
03:59:26.269 --> 03:59:26.279 align:start position:0%
that is confidential
 
03:59:28.910 --> 03:59:28.920 align:start position:0%
might we take the chart that Miss
 
03:59:31.370 --> 03:59:31.380 align:start position:0%
Courtney provided
 
03:59:33.650 --> 03:59:33.660 align:start position:0%
in our it's gosh it was even in the
 
03:59:35.389 --> 03:59:35.399 align:start position:0%
first part of this month it just seemed
 
03:59:38.570 --> 03:59:38.580 align:start position:0%
so long ago of various levels of
 
03:59:41.450 --> 03:59:41.460 align:start position:0%
discipline and say at this level it must
 
03:59:44.510 --> 03:59:44.520 align:start position:0%
be reported on the website but above it
 
03:59:48.290 --> 03:59:48.300 align:start position:0%
such as a momentary
 
03:59:51.650 --> 03:59:51.660 align:start position:0%
rudeness that was dealt with it does not
 
03:59:53.929 --> 03:59:53.939 align:start position:0%
have to be reported might we find that
 
03:59:57.050 --> 03:59:57.060 align:start position:0%
happy place where Bad Medicine must be I
 
03:59:58.010 --> 03:59:58.020 align:start position:0%
don't know why the Board of Medicine
 
04:00:00.950 --> 04:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't report it but no
 
04:00:03.710 --> 04:00:03.720 align:start position:0%
make a judgment on it but I something's
 
04:00:05.750 --> 04:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
missing and we're trying to find out
 
04:00:11.210 --> 04:00:11.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:13.610 --> 04:00:13.620 align:start position:0%
looking at complaints there are
 
04:00:15.170 --> 04:00:15.180 align:start position:0%
complaints where patients have been
 
04:00:18.050 --> 04:00:18.060 align:start position:0%
injured for whatever reason through
 
04:00:20.769 --> 04:00:20.779 align:start position:0%
incompetent practice
 
04:00:24.130 --> 04:00:24.140 align:start position:0%
through unavoidable complications
 
04:00:27.950 --> 04:00:27.960 align:start position:0%
there are could be possible discipline
 
04:00:30.769 --> 04:00:30.779 align:start position:0%
for somebody who has illegible uh
 
04:00:32.630 --> 04:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
medical records or incomplete medical
 
04:00:35.990 --> 04:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
records and
 
04:00:36.000 --> 04:00:38.150 align:start position:0%
records and
uh

04:00:38.150 --> 04:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:00:41.030 --> 04:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
again I looking at the examples I
 
04:00:44.450 --> 04:00:44.460 align:start position:0%
presented for a shoulder dystocia where
 
04:00:46.849 --> 04:00:46.859 align:start position:0%
it took five or six minutes to deliver a
 
04:00:48.530 --> 04:00:48.540 align:start position:0%
baby that was basically delivered dead
 
04:00:50.809 --> 04:00:50.819 align:start position:0%
and was resuscitated
 
04:00:52.910 --> 04:00:52.920 align:start position:0%
uh and then three years later there was
 
04:00:54.889 --> 04:00:54.899 align:start position:0%
a lawsuit
 
04:00:54.899 --> 04:00:55.729 align:start position:0%
a lawsuit
um

04:00:55.729 --> 04:00:55.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:59.510 --> 04:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
with uh neurologic delay and an Herb's
 
04:01:02.510 --> 04:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
palsy that
 
04:01:04.429 --> 04:01:04.439 align:start position:0%
when a kid doesn't come out there are
 
04:01:06.250 --> 04:01:06.260 align:start position:0%
only so many things you can do
 
04:01:08.990 --> 04:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
and doing those things this is something
 
04:01:13.330 --> 04:01:13.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:16.969 --> 04:01:16.979 align:start position:0%
I was able to affect a delivery and
 
04:01:18.950 --> 04:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
there was a lawsuit that was involved I
 
04:01:20.809 --> 04:01:20.819 align:start position:0%
was not named in it but the institution
 
04:01:24.170 --> 04:01:24.180 align:start position:0%
was and the board asked me to explain my
 
04:01:27.290 --> 04:01:27.300 align:start position:0%
care of that patient it was a delivery
 
04:01:29.150 --> 04:01:29.160 align:start position:0%
that I was pulled into at the very last
 
04:01:31.490 --> 04:01:31.500 align:start position:0%
minute by another provider who couldn't
 
04:01:32.870 --> 04:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
deliver the baby
 
04:01:36.950 --> 04:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
and I had to explain my care
 
04:01:40.370 --> 04:01:40.380 align:start position:0%
what I did uh and the difficulty I had
 
04:01:42.410 --> 04:01:42.420 align:start position:0%
in delivering that baby and the board
 
04:01:44.870 --> 04:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
decided boy this is a terrible outcome
 
04:01:47.389 --> 04:01:47.399 align:start position:0%
and you did everything that you had to
 
04:01:50.809 --> 04:01:50.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:00.349 --> 04:02:00.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:03.650 --> 04:02:03.660 align:start position:0%
on the one hand we seem to get be
 
04:02:05.150 --> 04:02:05.160 align:start position:0%
getting farther and farther into the
 
04:02:05.160 --> 04:02:06.590 align:start position:0%
getting farther and farther into the
weeds

04:02:06.590 --> 04:02:06.600 align:start position:0%
weeds
 
04:02:09.050 --> 04:02:09.060 align:start position:0%
on the other hand it seems to me that
 
04:02:11.570 --> 04:02:11.580 align:start position:0%
there are other people waiting who may
 
04:02:13.309 --> 04:02:13.319 align:start position:0%
actually be able to answer these
 
04:02:16.490 --> 04:02:16.500 align:start position:0%
questions better than the folks who are
 
04:02:19.010 --> 04:02:19.020 align:start position:0%
sitting at the table who I hope would be
 
04:02:21.469 --> 04:02:21.479 align:start position:0%
available to be come back if we have
 
04:02:23.570 --> 04:02:23.580 align:start position:0%
further questions in their specialty
 
04:02:26.929 --> 04:02:26.939 align:start position:0%
afterwards but it seems to me if I can
 
04:02:30.229 --> 04:02:30.239 align:start position:0%
clarify what we've heard so far there
 
04:02:32.330 --> 04:02:32.340 align:start position:0%
are two levels of discipline one at that
 
04:02:35.450 --> 04:02:35.460 align:start position:0%
institutional level and one at the board
 
04:02:38.990 --> 04:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
level and all discipline
 
04:02:42.950 --> 04:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
at the institutional level at a certain
 
04:02:44.870 --> 04:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
level has to be reported to the board
 
04:02:47.030 --> 04:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
which may or may not take further action
 
04:02:49.130 --> 04:02:49.140 align:start position:0%
if they did further action it's
 
04:02:52.269 --> 04:02:52.279 align:start position:0%
reportable if they don't it's not
 
04:02:57.889 --> 04:02:57.899 align:start position:0%
we can sit here we as a board need as
 
04:03:01.429 --> 04:03:01.439 align:start position:0%
this group need to decide if more needs
 
04:03:03.590 --> 04:03:03.600 align:start position:0%
to be done here
 
04:03:06.710 --> 04:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
and I think that if more needs to be
 
04:03:08.809 --> 04:03:08.819 align:start position:0%
done there needs to be a specific
 
04:03:08.819 --> 04:03:11.830 align:start position:0%
done there needs to be a specific
exploration

04:03:11.830 --> 04:03:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:15.710 --> 04:03:15.720 align:start position:0%
of what level of hospital and
 
04:03:18.309 --> 04:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
institutional involvement has to be
 
04:03:21.889 --> 04:03:21.899 align:start position:0%
reported on the website
 
04:03:25.969 --> 04:03:25.979 align:start position:0%
and that is not a determination that I
 
04:03:28.250 --> 04:03:28.260 align:start position:0%
am prepared to make today and wrote on
 
04:03:30.889 --> 04:03:30.899 align:start position:0%
today I think that has to be
 
04:03:34.729 --> 04:03:34.739 align:start position:0%
something for further action
 
04:03:38.809 --> 04:03:38.819 align:start position:0%
um so if we could perhaps describe the
 
04:03:43.309 --> 04:03:43.319 align:start position:0%
way forward but not have to make a final
 
04:03:45.950 --> 04:03:45.960 align:start position:0%
determination that might help because we
 
04:03:47.389 --> 04:03:47.399 align:start position:0%
all know that whatever happens we're
 
04:03:49.370 --> 04:03:49.380 align:start position:0%
going to have to put it into a bill and
 
04:03:51.050 --> 04:03:51.060 align:start position:0%
that's going to have a hearing and the
 
04:03:52.670 --> 04:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and all the rest of the
 
04:03:55.429 --> 04:03:55.439 align:start position:0%
process I agree I'd like to call I'd
 
04:03:58.010 --> 04:03:58.020 align:start position:0%
like to first of all thank you folks and
 
04:03:58.020 --> 04:03:59.269 align:start position:0%
like to first of all thank you folks and
now

04:03:59.269 --> 04:03:59.279 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:04:02.150 --> 04:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
um who better can speak to the hospitals
 
04:04:03.889 --> 04:04:03.899 align:start position:0%
than the president of the New Hampshire
 
04:04:08.150 --> 04:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
Hospital Association so um we I call the
 
04:04:09.650 --> 04:04:09.660 align:start position:0%
President Steve Allen to come forward
 
04:04:09.660 --> 04:04:12.170 align:start position:0%
President Steve Allen to come forward
please

04:04:12.170 --> 04:04:12.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:12.180 --> 04:04:18.550 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:04:18.550 --> 04:04:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:20.990 --> 04:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
04:04:22.309 --> 04:04:22.319 align:start position:0%
um for the record Steve Allman president
 
04:04:24.590 --> 04:04:24.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Hospital Association
 
04:04:27.590 --> 04:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
um so just a few comments and open it up
 
04:04:29.809 --> 04:04:29.819 align:start position:0%
for questions and discussion
 
04:04:33.590 --> 04:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
um Mr chairman we certainly
 
04:04:36.050 --> 04:04:36.060 align:start position:0%
appreciate your
 
04:04:38.150 --> 04:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
goal that you laid out at the very
 
04:04:40.189 --> 04:04:40.199 align:start position:0%
beginning of this hearing you've made
 
04:04:42.950 --> 04:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
that comment several times in public as
 
04:04:44.510 --> 04:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
well as in private
 
04:04:48.349 --> 04:04:48.359 align:start position:0%
um I think we would agree with that but
 
04:04:52.010 --> 04:04:52.020 align:start position:0%
how we do that is the question that we
 
04:04:53.750 --> 04:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
have in front of us and how we do that
 
04:04:56.990 --> 04:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
has to balance a lot of those varying
 
04:05:00.050 --> 04:05:00.060 align:start position:0%
um you know factors and I guess just a
 
04:05:01.250 --> 04:05:01.260 align:start position:0%
couple of things
 
04:05:03.490 --> 04:05:03.500 align:start position:0%
um I think this is going to require
 
04:05:06.050 --> 04:05:06.060 align:start position:0%
ongoing discussion and dialogue as I've
 
04:05:09.349 --> 04:05:09.359 align:start position:0%
said since these hearings began you know
 
04:05:10.309 --> 04:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
we want to be a part of this
 
04:05:12.469 --> 04:05:12.479 align:start position:0%
conversation going forward to ensure
 
04:05:13.849 --> 04:05:13.859 align:start position:0%
that you know we're doing the right
 
04:05:16.849 --> 04:05:16.859 align:start position:0%
things but we're also not penalizing
 
04:05:20.030 --> 04:05:20.040 align:start position:0%
those providers who are doing well and
 
04:05:21.530 --> 04:05:21.540 align:start position:0%
doing the right things those hospitals
 
04:05:23.150 --> 04:05:23.160 align:start position:0%
that are doing doing the right things
 
04:05:25.729 --> 04:05:25.739 align:start position:0%
and I believe you know our members are
 
04:05:26.929 --> 04:05:26.939 align:start position:0%
working very very hard and I think it
 
04:05:28.429 --> 04:05:28.439 align:start position:0%
would be helpful if I could just sort of
 
04:05:30.590 --> 04:05:30.600 align:start position:0%
give a sort of a big picture on a couple
 
04:05:33.469 --> 04:05:33.479 align:start position:0%
of things you know hospitals take their
 
04:05:35.990 --> 04:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility for who practices and who
 
04:05:38.750 --> 04:05:38.760 align:start position:0%
provide services inside their walls very
 
04:05:41.990 --> 04:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
very seriously they're governed by the
 
04:05:44.269 --> 04:05:44.279 align:start position:0%
conditions of participation under
 
04:05:46.670 --> 04:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
Medicare and Medicaid that require that
 
04:05:49.550 --> 04:05:49.560 align:start position:0%
hospital boards oversee the clinical
 
04:05:51.410 --> 04:05:51.420 align:start position:0%
practice within their their institutions
 
04:05:51.420 --> 04:05:52.610 align:start position:0%
practice within their their institutions
and

04:05:52.610 --> 04:05:52.620 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:05:55.010 --> 04:05:55.020 align:start position:0%
the accrediting organizations whether
 
04:05:58.429 --> 04:05:58.439 align:start position:0%
it's the Joint Commission dnv the CMS
 
04:06:00.830 --> 04:06:00.840 align:start position:0%
have the authority and the ability when
 
04:06:03.590 --> 04:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
they come in to review those records to
 
04:06:05.330 --> 04:06:05.340 align:start position:0%
ensure that they're doing the things
 
04:06:09.830 --> 04:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:11.809 --> 04:06:11.819 align:start position:0%
you know it's important to note you have
 
04:06:14.870 --> 04:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
a hospital with an Administration and a
 
04:06:17.510 --> 04:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
medical staff overseen by a Board of
 
04:06:20.090 --> 04:06:20.100 align:start position:0%
Trustees the medical staff is an
 
04:06:23.150 --> 04:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
independent body that on one hand works
 
04:06:24.650 --> 04:06:24.660 align:start position:0%
with the hospitals and partners with
 
04:06:24.660 --> 04:06:25.610 align:start position:0%
with the hospitals and partners with
them

04:06:25.610 --> 04:06:25.620 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:06:27.950 --> 04:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
um to to provide that that level of care
 
04:06:31.189 --> 04:06:31.199 align:start position:0%
and I've noted in several instances in
 
04:06:34.189 --> 04:06:34.199 align:start position:0%
the the document the report today refers
 
04:06:35.990 --> 04:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
to employed Physicians
 
04:06:38.990 --> 04:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
um I don't think that captures the the
 
04:06:42.110 --> 04:06:42.120 align:start position:0%
breadth of Physicians who are providing
 
04:06:43.969 --> 04:06:43.979 align:start position:0%
Services inside the hospital and that
 
04:06:45.710 --> 04:06:45.720 align:start position:0%
are part of the medical staff many
 
04:06:47.929 --> 04:06:47.939 align:start position:0%
Physicians are that are employed are
 
04:06:50.150 --> 04:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
part of the medical staff obviously but
 
04:06:52.490 --> 04:06:52.500 align:start position:0%
many others who are not employed are
 
04:06:55.670 --> 04:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
also part of the medical staff medical
 
04:06:58.510 --> 04:06:58.520 align:start position:0%
staff executive committees made up of
 
04:07:02.030 --> 04:07:02.040 align:start position:0%
doctors clinicians the hospital
 
04:07:05.630 --> 04:07:05.640 align:start position:0%
Administration and many many others that
 
04:07:07.550 --> 04:07:07.560 align:start position:0%
review those qualifications for
 
04:07:08.990 --> 04:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
clinicians when they're initially
 
04:07:11.570 --> 04:07:11.580 align:start position:0%
credentialed at the house hospital and
 
04:07:14.330 --> 04:07:14.340 align:start position:0%
ultimately granting privileges for those
 
04:07:16.790 --> 04:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
clinicians they review their
 
04:07:19.849 --> 04:07:19.859 align:start position:0%
qualifications as they come in through a
 
04:07:21.590 --> 04:07:21.600 align:start position:0%
focused provider practice and evaluation
 
04:07:24.170 --> 04:07:24.180 align:start position:0%
and they continue to focus they continue
 
04:07:27.530 --> 04:07:27.540 align:start position:0%
to do that on an ongoing basis so it
 
04:07:28.969 --> 04:07:28.979 align:start position:0%
could be every six months it could be
 
04:07:31.070 --> 04:07:31.080 align:start position:0%
every year they do have those reviews
 
04:07:35.030 --> 04:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
and there's determined by the medical
 
04:07:36.410 --> 04:07:36.420 align:start position:0%
executive committee the credentialing
 
04:07:38.450 --> 04:07:38.460 align:start position:0%
committee or others inside the
 
04:07:39.889 --> 04:07:39.899 align:start position:0%
institution how they're going to be
 
04:07:41.809 --> 04:07:41.819 align:start position:0%
reviewed what metrics and all of those
 
04:07:43.849 --> 04:07:43.859 align:start position:0%
things so again I think it's important
 
04:07:46.490 --> 04:07:46.500 align:start position:0%
to note that they continue they are
 
04:07:50.030 --> 04:07:50.040 align:start position:0%
continuously evaluated throughout their
 
04:07:53.630 --> 04:07:53.640 align:start position:0%
their tenure with the the hospital
 
04:07:53.640 --> 04:07:55.370 align:start position:0%
their tenure with the the hospital
um

04:07:55.370 --> 04:07:55.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:57.889 --> 04:07:57.899 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of talk about what
 
04:08:01.490 --> 04:08:01.500 align:start position:0%
gets reported hospitals are required by
 
04:08:04.670 --> 04:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
Statute by State Statute any facility
 
04:08:08.450 --> 04:08:08.460 align:start position:0%
that is licensed under RSA 151 is
 
04:08:11.750 --> 04:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
required to report any disciplinary
 
04:08:14.809 --> 04:08:14.819 align:start position:0%
action taken against a clinician a
 
04:08:17.750 --> 04:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
doctor a nurse a medical technician
 
04:08:17.760 --> 04:08:18.710 align:start position:0%
doctor a nurse a medical technician
um

04:08:18.710 --> 04:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:21.610 --> 04:08:21.620 align:start position:0%
and report that to the Board of Medicine
 
04:08:25.010 --> 04:08:25.020 align:start position:0%
the board then has the ability and as
 
04:08:27.469 --> 04:08:27.479 align:start position:0%
you heard will investigate every
 
04:08:29.389 --> 04:08:29.399 align:start position:0%
instance that comes to it and we'll
 
04:08:32.570 --> 04:08:32.580 align:start position:0%
choose whether they wish to make a move
 
04:08:38.330 --> 04:08:38.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:41.150 --> 04:08:41.160 align:start position:0%
I think it's you know important to
 
04:08:44.090 --> 04:08:44.100 align:start position:0%
remember you know not every
 
04:08:47.210 --> 04:08:47.220 align:start position:0%
complaint not every now practice
 
04:08:49.550 --> 04:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
um you know settlement is and is an
 
04:08:51.229 --> 04:08:51.239 align:start position:0%
admission of guilt
 
04:08:53.689 --> 04:08:53.699 align:start position:0%
um and that they have somehow done the
 
04:08:55.130 --> 04:08:55.140 align:start position:0%
wrong thing
 
04:08:57.410 --> 04:08:57.420 align:start position:0%
um you know we refer here and we've
 
04:08:59.870 --> 04:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
heard several times today lapses of
 
04:09:01.550 --> 04:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
professional judgment
 
04:09:04.189 --> 04:09:04.199 align:start position:0%
um you know when a situation happens it
 
04:09:05.330 --> 04:09:05.340 align:start position:0%
may be
 
04:09:07.969 --> 04:09:07.979 align:start position:0%
um an error occurred and if that
 
04:09:10.070 --> 04:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
happened we want to identify it we want
 
04:09:12.530 --> 04:09:12.540 align:start position:0%
to understand it and we want to prevent
 
04:09:14.750 --> 04:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
it from happening again and there's
 
04:09:16.490 --> 04:09:16.500 align:start position:0%
significant amount of effort and work
 
04:09:19.309 --> 04:09:19.319 align:start position:0%
that goes into doing that just that and
 
04:09:21.050 --> 04:09:21.060 align:start position:0%
if there are other circumstances
 
04:09:23.150 --> 04:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
surrounding it we want to make certain
 
04:09:25.969 --> 04:09:25.979 align:start position:0%
that we identify those as well every
 
04:09:30.590 --> 04:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
institution in the state has a a and the
 
04:09:32.809 --> 04:09:32.819 align:start position:0%
the interest of their patients and the
 
04:09:35.150 --> 04:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
communities that they serve at heart and
 
04:09:36.710 --> 04:09:36.720 align:start position:0%
they take those responsibilities very
 
04:09:38.750 --> 04:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
very seriously and they will continue to
 
04:09:40.969 --> 04:09:40.979 align:start position:0%
do so having said that we understand
 
04:09:43.849 --> 04:09:43.859 align:start position:0%
that there are questions here that are
 
04:09:45.650 --> 04:09:45.660 align:start position:0%
going to require some additional work
 
04:09:47.990 --> 04:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
and as I said we want to continue to be
 
04:09:49.550 --> 04:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
a part of that discussion and we
 
04:09:51.050 --> 04:09:51.060 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to share some
 
04:09:54.050 --> 04:09:54.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:55.969 --> 04:09:55.979 align:start position:0%
much reps
 
04:09:58.849 --> 04:09:58.859 align:start position:0%
Mr Allen good seeing you again different
 
04:10:01.010 --> 04:10:01.020 align:start position:0%
context but um
 
04:10:04.969 --> 04:10:04.979 align:start position:0%
so I I can't let go of this bone and I'm
 
04:10:07.030 --> 04:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
going to ask you for your opinion on it
 
04:10:10.490 --> 04:10:10.500 align:start position:0%
in those narrow cases those few cases
 
04:10:12.769 --> 04:10:12.779 align:start position:0%
were the hospital for whatever reason
 
04:10:14.990 --> 04:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
has decided to take action on a
 
04:10:18.290 --> 04:10:18.300 align:start position:0%
physician for discipline of any kind and
 
04:10:20.330 --> 04:10:20.340 align:start position:0%
it gets mandatorily reported to the
 
04:10:23.750 --> 04:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine as you described what
 
04:10:25.809 --> 04:10:25.819 align:start position:0%
is your position what's the hospital
 
04:10:29.030 --> 04:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
association's position on the board of
 
04:10:33.590 --> 04:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
medicine at least echoing the action of
 
04:10:36.309 --> 04:10:36.319 align:start position:0%
the hospital to the public
 
04:10:39.050 --> 04:10:39.060 align:start position:0%
currently if the Board of Medicine takes
 
04:10:41.750 --> 04:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
no action I'm hearing that it's not
 
04:10:44.750 --> 04:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
reported even if the hospitals in your
 
04:10:47.630 --> 04:10:47.640 align:start position:0%
own judgment have levied some sort of a
 
04:10:50.450 --> 04:10:50.460 align:start position:0%
restriction or penalty that it isn't it
 
04:10:52.429 --> 04:10:52.439 align:start position:0%
may not be reported by the Board of
 
04:10:54.830 --> 04:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
Medicine is is that is the is that the
 
04:10:57.769 --> 04:10:57.779 align:start position:0%
right thing or is that a a gap that we
 
04:10:59.809 --> 04:10:59.819 align:start position:0%
should be worried about I think it's an
 
04:11:02.750 --> 04:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
important question as I said not all
 
04:11:05.689 --> 04:11:05.699 align:start position:0%
instances are created equally and so how
 
04:11:08.510 --> 04:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
we just whether whether in which in
 
04:11:10.309 --> 04:11:10.319 align:start position:0%
which we choose to would choose to do
 
04:11:12.889 --> 04:11:12.899 align:start position:0%
that I think is the the question that we
 
04:11:14.090 --> 04:11:14.100 align:start position:0%
have in front of us I don't have an
 
04:11:16.250 --> 04:11:16.260 align:start position:0%
answer for you um today but I think it's
 
04:11:18.110 --> 04:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
an important question that we need to to
 
04:11:21.290 --> 04:11:21.300 align:start position:0%
try and uh work through
 
04:11:23.210 --> 04:11:23.220 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:11:27.650 --> 04:11:27.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:31.729 --> 04:11:31.739 align:start position:0%
do we think that by the end of today
 
04:11:34.969 --> 04:11:34.979 align:start position:0%
we're able to solve this question
 
04:11:38.210 --> 04:11:38.220 align:start position:0%
or do you think that it would be a good
 
04:11:41.689 --> 04:11:41.699 align:start position:0%
idea if we crafted an LSR
 
04:11:45.710 --> 04:11:45.720 align:start position:0%
that would set up a group
 
04:11:47.210 --> 04:11:47.220 align:start position:0%
next year
 
04:11:50.090 --> 04:11:50.100 align:start position:0%
with the principal stakeholders and
 
04:11:52.429 --> 04:11:52.439 align:start position:0%
different ones of us and representative
 
04:11:55.189 --> 04:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
solo I pulled out of retirement
 
04:11:58.150 --> 04:11:58.160 align:start position:0%
to go into quite a bit of depth on this
 
04:12:01.010 --> 04:12:01.020 align:start position:0%
with the various stakeholders knowing
 
04:12:02.929 --> 04:12:02.939 align:start position:0%
that they'll now have two three four
 
04:12:05.689 --> 04:12:05.699 align:start position:0%
months to work up some things what do
 
04:12:08.150 --> 04:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:11.630 --> 04:12:11.640 align:start position:0%
um I I would say that
 
04:12:14.570 --> 04:12:14.580 align:start position:0%
um one could go I agree full
 
04:12:15.769 --> 04:12:15.779 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly with your first
 
04:12:17.450 --> 04:12:17.460 align:start position:0%
conclusion we're not going to solve this
 
04:12:17.460 --> 04:12:18.530 align:start position:0%
conclusion we're not going to solve this
now

04:12:18.530 --> 04:12:18.540 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:12:20.750 --> 04:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
I think one could do one of two things
 
04:12:23.990 --> 04:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
one could either craft exactly what
 
04:12:25.429 --> 04:12:25.439 align:start position:0%
you're talking about create a working
 
04:12:27.889 --> 04:12:27.899 align:start position:0%
group and a study committee or
 
04:12:29.990 --> 04:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
commission that your discretion
 
04:12:32.929 --> 04:12:32.939 align:start position:0%
remembering always the pressure that we
 
04:12:35.150 --> 04:12:35.160 align:start position:0%
will get from the speaker's office about
 
04:12:38.510 --> 04:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
the use of people and how to appoint
 
04:12:41.510 --> 04:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
them and all the rest of it so that's
 
04:12:45.650 --> 04:12:45.660 align:start position:0%
one way you can go or uh one or more
 
04:12:50.150 --> 04:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
people can file one or more lsrs and
 
04:12:53.889 --> 04:12:53.899 align:start position:0%
those can have hearings and
 
04:12:57.410 --> 04:12:57.420 align:start position:0%
they can either proceed as they are
 
04:13:01.910 --> 04:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
drafted or be modified or be referred
 
04:13:05.150 --> 04:13:05.160 align:start position:0%
for interim study or can be changed into
 
04:13:07.189 --> 04:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
a study committee at that point
 
04:13:10.370 --> 04:13:10.380 align:start position:0%
I was thinking that plus one of the
 
04:13:13.250 --> 04:13:13.260 align:start position:0%
possibilities would be to draft an LSR
 
04:13:15.650 --> 04:13:15.660 align:start position:0%
coming out of this because we will
 
04:13:17.689 --> 04:13:17.699 align:start position:0%
probably have two months to craft an
 
04:13:20.030 --> 04:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
amendment during which time different
 
04:13:21.769 --> 04:13:21.779 align:start position:0%
ones of his cut could talk with
 
04:13:23.990 --> 04:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
different people so that by the time
 
04:13:27.290 --> 04:13:27.300 align:start position:0%
probably Edna takes up that bill in
 
04:13:30.110 --> 04:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
early February or later we would have
 
04:13:32.269 --> 04:13:32.279 align:start position:0%
done quite a bit more work and have an
 
04:13:32.279 --> 04:13:34.070 align:start position:0%
done quite a bit more work and have an
amendment

04:13:34.070 --> 04:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:13:36.290 --> 04:13:36.300 align:start position:0%
is a thought
 
04:13:39.050 --> 04:13:39.060 align:start position:0%
representative Solway uh thank you Mr
 
04:13:42.050 --> 04:13:42.060 align:start position:0%
chairman Mr chairman it is the long
 
04:13:45.170 --> 04:13:45.180 align:start position:0%
practice and custom of the state
 
04:13:48.469 --> 04:13:48.479 align:start position:0%
legislature to await the crafting of
 
04:13:51.590 --> 04:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
lsrs to refer them to committee and to
 
04:13:54.229 --> 04:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
permit the committee process to refine
 
04:13:56.689 --> 04:13:56.699 align:start position:0%
and then decide if they're going to
 
04:13:59.150 --> 04:13:59.160 align:start position:0%
enact statute and I would suggest that
 
04:14:03.889 --> 04:14:03.899 align:start position:0%
we submit a report to the oversight
 
04:14:06.290 --> 04:14:06.300 align:start position:0%
committee and that members of the
 
04:14:08.929 --> 04:14:08.939 align:start position:0%
oversight committee or other members of
 
04:14:10.929 --> 04:14:10.939 align:start position:0%
what will then be the newly elected
 
04:14:13.910 --> 04:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
legislature determine if they wish to
 
04:14:21.490 --> 04:14:21.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:25.610 --> 04:14:25.620 align:start position:0%
okay so I I agree with everything that's
 
04:14:27.410 --> 04:14:27.420 align:start position:0%
been said I just think there's a third
 
04:14:30.349 --> 04:14:30.359 align:start position:0%
thing here to make it more obvious we
 
04:14:34.670 --> 04:14:34.680 align:start position:0%
are trying very hard to approve a a uh a
 
04:14:37.250 --> 04:14:37.260 align:start position:0%
draft or a final report on our
 
04:14:40.550 --> 04:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
committee's work I think we found a hole
 
04:14:44.269 --> 04:14:44.279 align:start position:0%
here uh and if we could just include the
 
04:14:47.870 --> 04:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
fact that this hole exists in Professor
 
04:14:50.809 --> 04:14:50.819 align:start position:0%
shalloway's report so that we don't lose
 
04:14:52.910 --> 04:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
it I think it's a reportable item in
 
04:14:55.250 --> 04:14:55.260 align:start position:0%
this final report that we include that
 
04:14:59.269 --> 04:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
we found this Gap where hospitals do
 
04:15:01.550 --> 04:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
initiate disciplinary action and the
 
04:15:04.189 --> 04:15:04.199 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine may choose not to
 
04:15:06.050 --> 04:15:06.060 align:start position:0%
follow up on it and therefore the public
 
04:15:08.570 --> 04:15:08.580 align:start position:0%
is unaware that that's an issue that we
 
04:15:10.550 --> 04:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
should look into if we could just
 
04:15:14.090 --> 04:15:14.100 align:start position:0%
include that in this final report that I
 
04:15:15.650 --> 04:15:15.660 align:start position:0%
think I think we're doing what we can do
 
04:15:15.660 --> 04:15:16.729 align:start position:0%
think I think we're doing what we can do
today

04:15:16.729 --> 04:15:16.739 align:start position:0%
today
 
04:15:19.610 --> 04:15:19.620 align:start position:0%
how do other members of this group think
 
04:15:22.429 --> 04:15:22.439 align:start position:0%
about that representative Murphy I I I
 
04:15:24.410 --> 04:15:24.420 align:start position:0%
think I agree with everything that has
 
04:15:26.990 --> 04:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
been said I also hear from uh president
 
04:15:30.229 --> 04:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
Anin and others that there is a lot of
 
04:15:32.870 --> 04:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
missing information that we do not have
 
04:15:35.570 --> 04:15:35.580 align:start position:0%
available currently or if we have it we
 
04:15:37.250 --> 04:15:37.260 align:start position:0%
don't fully understand the ramifications
 
04:15:38.210 --> 04:15:38.220 align:start position:0%
of it
 
04:15:39.950 --> 04:15:39.960 align:start position:0%
so having said that I would think that
 
04:15:43.010 --> 04:15:43.020 align:start position:0%
our number one goal to back up at the 50
 
04:15:44.809 --> 04:15:44.819 align:start position:0%
000 foot level is to think about number
 
04:15:47.570 --> 04:15:47.580 align:start position:0%
one the patient first and our goal here
 
04:15:50.210 --> 04:15:50.220 align:start position:0%
is to do whatever is in is needed to be
 
04:15:52.429 --> 04:15:52.439 align:start position:0%
done to make sure that the public the
 
04:15:54.229 --> 04:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
patients all know who is going to take
 
04:15:56.570 --> 04:15:56.580 align:start position:0%
care of them that these these providers
 
04:15:58.969 --> 04:15:58.979 align:start position:0%
have the credentials the privileging and
 
04:16:00.950 --> 04:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
the expertise to take care of them and
 
04:16:02.990 --> 04:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
that the mechanics behind how
 
04:16:04.849 --> 04:16:04.859 align:start position:0%
information is garnered within a
 
04:16:07.250 --> 04:16:07.260 align:start position:0%
hospital setting in a private practice
 
04:16:10.309 --> 04:16:10.319 align:start position:0%
or whatever if it's if if it's necessary
 
04:16:11.929 --> 04:16:11.939 align:start position:0%
to reach the Board of Medicine for the
 
04:16:14.689 --> 04:16:14.699 align:start position:0%
review that we have a fully
 
04:16:17.389 --> 04:16:17.399 align:start position:0%
a fully understood process by which that
 
04:16:18.530 --> 04:16:18.540 align:start position:0%
happens and I don't think we understand
 
04:16:22.130 --> 04:16:22.140 align:start position:0%
that right now so whether you know as a
 
04:16:24.050 --> 04:16:24.060 align:start position:0%
freshman legislator I don't understand
 
04:16:26.570 --> 04:16:26.580 align:start position:0%
necessarily whether it first goes to an
 
04:16:28.729 --> 04:16:28.739 align:start position:0%
LSR whether it goes to a study committee
 
04:16:31.189 --> 04:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
what I do know is that my primary goal
 
04:16:32.990 --> 04:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
is the patient and the safety of the
 
04:16:35.510 --> 04:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
patient how we get there mechanically
 
04:16:37.490 --> 04:16:37.500 align:start position:0%
legislatively I will leave to those with
 
04:16:39.530 --> 04:16:39.540 align:start position:0%
more I would say more gray here but more
 
04:16:41.210 --> 04:16:41.220 align:start position:0%
experience than I have
 
04:16:43.070 --> 04:16:43.080 align:start position:0%
um I would add representative Murphy
 
04:16:45.710 --> 04:16:45.720 align:start position:0%
that my parallel goal is to protect good
 
04:16:48.349 --> 04:16:48.359 align:start position:0%
Physicians and hospitals absolutely I
 
04:16:49.610 --> 04:16:49.620 align:start position:0%
was going to say that as well is that
 
04:16:51.830 --> 04:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
there are a number of you know I've
 
04:16:53.510 --> 04:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
practiced medicine in the state for 40
 
04:16:55.969 --> 04:16:55.979 align:start position:0%
years and I can't even count on one
 
04:16:58.250 --> 04:16:58.260 align:start position:0%
finger how many practitioners and
 
04:17:00.769 --> 04:17:00.779 align:start position:0%
hospitals that I have dealt with at a
 
04:17:02.330 --> 04:17:02.340 align:start position:0%
referral center where we received
 
04:17:04.610 --> 04:17:04.620 align:start position:0%
patients from all over the state that
 
04:17:05.870 --> 04:17:05.880 align:start position:0%
weren't trying to do the best thing for
 
04:17:07.969 --> 04:17:07.979 align:start position:0%
their patients things go wrong in an
 
04:17:10.070 --> 04:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
operating room I know that things can go
 
04:17:12.229 --> 04:17:12.239 align:start position:0%
wrong in the clinic I know that but most
 
04:17:14.090 --> 04:17:14.100 align:start position:0%
of the providers out there most of the
 
04:17:15.590 --> 04:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
hospitals are trying to do their
 
04:17:17.870 --> 04:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
darndest to make sure that quality Care
 
04:17:20.090 --> 04:17:20.100 align:start position:0%
is given to the patient
 
04:17:21.769 --> 04:17:21.779 align:start position:0%
there will be outliers but I want to
 
04:17:24.590 --> 04:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
make sure that we don't don't lose sight
 
04:17:26.150 --> 04:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
of the fact that we have a number of
 
04:17:28.070 --> 04:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
great physicians in the state that are
 
04:17:29.809 --> 04:17:29.819 align:start position:0%
doing their darndest and we need to
 
04:17:31.429 --> 04:17:31.439 align:start position:0%
protect those even if they have a
 
04:17:33.349 --> 04:17:33.359 align:start position:0%
lawsuit against them a lawsuit is
 
04:17:35.389 --> 04:17:35.399 align:start position:0%
settled we still need to protect them
 
04:17:37.070 --> 04:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
and I would fully support any
 
04:17:38.450 --> 04:17:38.460 align:start position:0%
legislation that supports those
 
04:17:38.460 --> 04:17:40.370 align:start position:0%
legislation that supports those
providers

04:17:40.370 --> 04:17:40.380 align:start position:0%
providers
 
04:17:43.429 --> 04:17:43.439 align:start position:0%
so now so so may I crash to the 10 foot
 
04:17:45.670 --> 04:17:45.680 align:start position:0%
level since we just hit 50 000
 
04:17:47.870 --> 04:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
representative Whoever has to leave in
 
04:17:51.590 --> 04:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
four zero minutes we we she has input
 
04:17:54.590 --> 04:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
into our final report uh this is sort of
 
04:17:56.689 --> 04:17:56.699 align:start position:0%
our deliverable to the day I believe
 
04:17:59.450 --> 04:17:59.460 align:start position:0%
this is our deliverable uh we're not
 
04:18:01.189 --> 04:18:01.199 align:start position:0%
going to save any patients today we're
 
04:18:03.110 --> 04:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
just going to finish a report so if we
 
04:18:06.530 --> 04:18:06.540 align:start position:0%
could maybe start focusing on what we
 
04:18:08.929 --> 04:18:08.939 align:start position:0%
want in this report I don't know who
 
04:18:10.969 --> 04:18:10.979 align:start position:0%
else you have to speak but I I don't
 
04:18:13.750 --> 04:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
want to lose the the window of
 
04:18:16.450 --> 04:18:16.460 align:start position:0%
Representative Weber's time and pod
 
04:18:19.189 --> 04:18:19.199 align:start position:0%
since this is very much a work group
 
04:18:22.130 --> 04:18:22.140 align:start position:0%
some of the rules that we have in normal
 
04:18:24.650 --> 04:18:24.660 align:start position:0%
hearings are different
 
04:18:27.530 --> 04:18:27.540 align:start position:0%
and so therefore we could move right to
 
04:18:30.650 --> 04:18:30.660 align:start position:0%
discuss this report with how we wish to
 
04:18:33.170 --> 04:18:33.180 align:start position:0%
tweak it and then Circle back and if
 
04:18:36.050 --> 04:18:36.060 align:start position:0%
time allows uh hear from others who may
 
04:18:38.929 --> 04:18:38.939 align:start position:0%
wish to give us some input so we may get
 
04:18:42.110 --> 04:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
to some of you the representative Anan
 
04:18:43.610 --> 04:18:43.620 align:start position:0%
do you have anything further you'd like
 
04:18:45.950 --> 04:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
to add no my question was this is a
 
04:18:48.830 --> 04:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
lovely venue and seat uh it's a great
 
04:18:48.840 --> 04:18:49.929 align:start position:0%
lovely venue and seat uh it's a great
sequence

04:18:49.929 --> 04:18:49.939 align:start position:0%
sequence
 
04:18:52.910 --> 04:18:52.920 align:start position:0%
but I'm not sure you need me here for
 
04:18:54.830 --> 04:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
that um so if you're done with me I'll
 
04:18:56.990 --> 04:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
just get back there
 
04:18:59.330 --> 04:18:59.340 align:start position:0%
you're always welcome up at the hot mic
 
04:19:02.630 --> 04:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
04:19:04.429 --> 04:19:04.439 align:start position:0%
representative web I want to take a stab
 
04:19:06.229 --> 04:19:06.239 align:start position:0%
at it
 
04:19:09.110 --> 04:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
this report the latest iteration of
 
04:19:11.689 --> 04:19:11.699 align:start position:0%
Representative soloway's Report with
 
04:19:14.510 --> 04:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
what probably needs to be tweaked
 
04:19:14.520 --> 04:19:16.130 align:start position:0%
what probably needs to be tweaked
uh

04:19:16.130 --> 04:19:16.140 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:19:19.010 --> 04:19:19.020 align:start position:0%
a word Mr chairman a word I'd like to
 
04:19:21.830 --> 04:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
reassure representative Weber
 
04:19:24.050 --> 04:19:24.060 align:start position:0%
that her Communications were read
 
04:19:26.809 --> 04:19:26.819 align:start position:0%
carefully and were if you will not
 
04:19:29.510 --> 04:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
incorporated into the revision of the
 
04:19:29.520 --> 04:19:33.170 align:start position:0%
incorporated into the revision of the
document

04:19:33.170 --> 04:19:33.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:35.990 --> 04:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
I'm going to apologize because I didn't
 
04:19:38.530 --> 04:19:38.540 align:start position:0%
see the revision of the document because
 
04:19:42.769 --> 04:19:42.779 align:start position:0%
I have been somewhat inattentive to my
 
04:19:44.389 --> 04:19:44.399 align:start position:0%
emails so
 
04:19:46.130 --> 04:19:46.140 align:start position:0%
um would you care to share I certainly
 
04:19:48.650 --> 04:19:48.660 align:start position:0%
no I will no no no no I would I would
 
04:19:50.929 --> 04:19:50.939 align:start position:0%
absolutely believe my colleague when he
 
04:19:52.969 --> 04:19:52.979 align:start position:0%
says he's taken them into account and
 
04:19:54.650 --> 04:19:54.660 align:start position:0%
Incorporated them
 
04:19:56.870 --> 04:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
I think that
 
04:19:59.210 --> 04:19:59.220 align:start position:0%
you know what I've heard from others is
 
04:20:04.309 --> 04:20:04.319 align:start position:0%
simply the specific issue of exploring
 
04:20:04.319 --> 04:20:05.830 align:start position:0%
simply the specific issue of exploring
the

04:20:05.830 --> 04:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:20:08.170 --> 04:20:08.180 align:start position:0%
relationship between
 
04:20:10.729 --> 04:20:10.739 align:start position:0%
discipline at the institutional level
 
04:20:15.410 --> 04:20:15.420 align:start position:0%
and discipline at the board level uh and
 
04:20:17.590 --> 04:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
I think we can simply
 
04:20:20.330 --> 04:20:20.340 align:start position:0%
perhaps rely on your good nature to put
 
04:20:23.030 --> 04:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
in one more sentence or possibly short
 
04:20:26.630 --> 04:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
paragraph on that specific issue because
 
04:20:29.929 --> 04:20:29.939 align:start position:0%
that seems to be where the nub is
 
04:20:32.389 --> 04:20:32.399 align:start position:0%
um and and then state that
 
04:20:34.550 --> 04:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
um you know further legislative action
 
04:20:37.670 --> 04:20:37.680 align:start position:0%
will be considered by individuals at the
 
04:20:39.590 --> 04:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate time
 
04:20:42.349 --> 04:20:42.359 align:start position:0%
and that that would be fine with me if
 
04:20:44.330 --> 04:20:44.340 align:start position:0%
that satisfies other people
 
04:20:46.010 --> 04:20:46.020 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
04:20:49.490 --> 04:20:49.500 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards next okay so I I
 
04:20:51.950 --> 04:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
agree with uh representative Weber and
 
04:20:54.729 --> 04:20:54.739 align:start position:0%
as I'm looking at the paper is currently
 
04:20:58.370 --> 04:20:58.380 align:start position:0%
constructed it appeals to me like we
 
04:21:00.950 --> 04:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
want to add after the section on board
 
04:21:03.710 --> 04:21:03.720 align:start position:0%
investigations we want to add a new
 
04:21:06.410 --> 04:21:06.420 align:start position:0%
section called uh Board of Medicine
 
04:21:06.420 --> 04:21:08.450 align:start position:0%
section called uh Board of Medicine
reporting

04:21:08.450 --> 04:21:08.460 align:start position:0%
reporting
 
04:21:11.090 --> 04:21:11.100 align:start position:0%
and and that and that under the The
 
04:21:13.610 --> 04:21:13.620 align:start position:0%
Heading of reporting would be a very
 
04:21:15.650 --> 04:21:15.660 align:start position:0%
nice place to hang this open issue that
 
04:21:17.809 --> 04:21:17.819 align:start position:0%
we're not going to resolve today and
 
04:21:19.550 --> 04:21:19.560 align:start position:0%
then we'd still end up closing with
 
04:21:21.590 --> 04:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
Staffing and funding but we'd have a new
 
04:21:23.510 --> 04:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
section four
 
04:21:26.150 --> 04:21:26.160 align:start position:0%
representative soloway uh thank you Mr
 
04:21:29.990 --> 04:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
chairman uh uh a couple of quick items
 
04:21:32.150 --> 04:21:32.160 align:start position:0%
there are some revisions in here that
 
04:21:33.650 --> 04:21:33.660 align:start position:0%
you should know about
 
04:21:36.530 --> 04:21:36.540 align:start position:0%
um at Representatives Edwards insistence
 
04:21:41.150 --> 04:21:41.160 align:start position:0%
uh I will change chef of medicine uh to
 
04:21:43.910 --> 04:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
chief of medicine uh and we'll we'll
 
04:21:46.070 --> 04:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
cook that over
 
04:21:47.929 --> 04:21:47.939 align:start position:0%
um and
 
04:21:52.729 --> 04:21:52.739 align:start position:0%
um a representative Weber uh and
 
04:21:56.090 --> 04:21:56.100 align:start position:0%
um Ms minnehan the issue of the
 
04:21:58.610 --> 04:21:58.620 align:start position:0%
statement of employed Physicians I'll go
 
04:22:01.849 --> 04:22:01.859 align:start position:0%
over that but I must agree with the
 
04:22:04.250 --> 04:22:04.260 align:start position:0%
discussion that
 
04:22:08.809 --> 04:22:08.819 align:start position:0%
um the point on which the case turns
 
04:22:11.990 --> 04:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
representative Weber to a phrase that
 
04:22:15.170 --> 04:22:15.180 align:start position:0%
you're familiar with is what is
 
04:22:17.349 --> 04:22:17.359 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action
 
04:22:19.990 --> 04:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
where does it take place
 
04:22:23.510 --> 04:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
and what of it should be reported
 
04:22:27.349 --> 04:22:27.359 align:start position:0%
precise I I think we're there so I will
 
04:22:30.530 --> 04:22:30.540 align:start position:0%
add as representative Edwards uh
 
04:22:34.490 --> 04:22:34.500 align:start position:0%
requested a brief paragraph that speaks
 
04:22:38.950 --> 04:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
to that issue uh uh how do we report
 
04:22:42.290 --> 04:22:42.300 align:start position:0%
this disciplinary actions variously
 
04:22:45.290 --> 04:22:45.300 align:start position:0%
defined just the final word I would like
 
04:22:47.750 --> 04:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
to thank profoundly
 
04:22:50.450 --> 04:22:50.460 align:start position:0%
um representative Murphy uh
 
04:22:53.050 --> 04:22:53.060 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards uh the chairman
 
04:22:56.450 --> 04:22:56.460 align:start position:0%
representative Weber for the substantial
 
04:22:59.570 --> 04:22:59.580 align:start position:0%
work that they've put into crafting this
 
04:23:03.110 --> 04:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
document my name is not on it because I
 
04:23:05.570 --> 04:23:05.580 align:start position:0%
am simply the clerk for people of far
 
04:23:08.750 --> 04:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:08.760 --> 04:23:11.650 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:23:11.650 --> 04:23:11.660 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
04:23:13.910 --> 04:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
exception to that last qualification
 
04:23:16.130 --> 04:23:16.140 align:start position:0%
well yeah so do we all you're voted down
 
04:23:18.410 --> 04:23:18.420 align:start position:0%
on that um would you craft a couple
 
04:23:18.420 --> 04:23:20.510 align:start position:0%
on that um would you craft a couple
sentences

04:23:20.510 --> 04:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
sentences
 
04:23:25.670 --> 04:23:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:29.090 --> 04:23:29.100 align:start position:0%
um and then we will take my uh title the
 
04:23:32.150 --> 04:23:32.160 align:start position:0%
change of Chef to Chief although
 
04:23:35.269 --> 04:23:35.279 align:start position:0%
I was hungry for more
 
04:23:39.290 --> 04:23:39.300 align:start position:0%
you asked for it uh
 
04:23:39.300 --> 04:23:41.410 align:start position:0%
you asked for it uh
foreign

04:23:41.410 --> 04:23:41.420 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
04:23:44.870 --> 04:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
I will say something I I can't write it
 
04:23:47.630 --> 04:23:47.640 align:start position:0%
and say it at the same time if you wrote
 
04:23:49.849 --> 04:23:49.859 align:start position:0%
it and then said it
 
04:23:51.469 --> 04:23:51.479 align:start position:0%
well if you want to give me about three
 
04:23:53.809 --> 04:23:53.819 align:start position:0%
minutes I would and I'll try at the same
 
04:23:55.189 --> 04:23:55.199 align:start position:0%
time and maybe we can come up with
 
04:23:55.199 --> 04:24:03.050 align:start position:0%
time and maybe we can come up with
something

04:24:03.050 --> 04:24:03.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:07.490 --> 04:24:07.500 align:start position:0%
I I can almost do it orally it says I I
 
04:24:10.670 --> 04:24:10.680 align:start position:0%
would say it is it appears that further
 
04:24:14.750 --> 04:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:14.760 --> 04:24:15.830 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:24:15.830 --> 04:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:21.110 --> 04:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
to resolve the issue of the differing
 
04:24:25.010 --> 04:24:25.020 align:start position:0%
to resolve the issues of
 
04:24:26.990 --> 04:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
the differing
 
04:24:30.050 --> 04:24:30.060 align:start position:0%
no I can't do it orally yeah I'll keep
 
04:24:30.060 --> 04:24:41.450 align:start position:0%
no I can't do it orally yeah I'll keep
working

04:24:41.450 --> 04:24:41.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:44.450 --> 04:24:44.460 align:start position:0%
could the chair ask Miss minahan please
 
04:24:47.710 --> 04:24:47.720 align:start position:0%
to punch up the board of medicine's
 
04:24:51.530 --> 04:24:51.540 align:start position:0%
website and scroll down to board actions
 
04:24:53.630 --> 04:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
and bring the computer up so I can
 
04:24:57.410 --> 04:24:57.420 align:start position:0%
actually see it thank you
 
04:24:59.990 --> 04:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
and if we're doing that I actually have
 
04:25:02.030 --> 04:25:02.040 align:start position:0%
a question based on the fact that I've
 
04:25:05.510 --> 04:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:07.729 --> 04:25:07.739 align:start position:0%
and you wonder why I asked you to be on
 
04:25:28.790 --> 04:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:28.800 --> 04:25:55.510 align:start position:0%

04:25:55.510 --> 04:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:57.889 --> 04:25:57.899 align:start position:0%
if we begin with the committee
 
04:26:01.030 --> 04:26:01.040 align:start position:0%
recognizes that disciplinary action
 
04:26:03.349 --> 04:26:03.359 align:start position:0%
occurs at the level of Hospital review
 
04:26:07.429 --> 04:26:07.439 align:start position:0%
medical staff review judicial review and
 
04:26:12.010 --> 04:26:12.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:15.469 --> 04:26:15.479 align:start position:0%
and then we need another sentence it is
 
04:26:17.630 --> 04:26:17.640 align:start position:0%
therefore imperative
 
04:26:20.750 --> 04:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
that any legislation
 
04:26:23.750 --> 04:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
specify for the Board of Medicine
 
04:26:26.330 --> 04:26:26.340 align:start position:0%
those disciplinary actions which do and
 
04:26:31.070 --> 04:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:33.710 --> 04:26:33.720 align:start position:0%
I was with you up to the
 
04:26:35.750 --> 04:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
um what I was working on for the second
 
04:26:37.309 --> 04:26:37.319 align:start position:0%
part of that because I like the first
 
04:26:38.990 --> 04:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
part better than what I said which was
 
04:26:40.670 --> 04:26:40.680 align:start position:0%
just discipline occurs at both the
 
04:26:42.290 --> 04:26:42.300 align:start position:0%
institutional level and the board level
 
04:26:44.630 --> 04:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
and you are far more comprehensive than
 
04:26:47.450 --> 04:26:47.460 align:start position:0%
I and then I would say more explanation
 
04:26:50.510 --> 04:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
is needed to determine the level at
 
04:26:50.520 --> 04:26:51.729 align:start position:0%
is needed to determine the level at
which

04:26:51.729 --> 04:26:51.739 align:start position:0%
which
 
04:26:54.550 --> 04:26:54.560 align:start position:0%
uh discipline
 
04:26:58.309 --> 04:26:58.319 align:start position:0%
must be reported to the Board of
 
04:27:01.030 --> 04:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
Medicine disciplined by any other body
 
04:27:03.530 --> 04:27:03.540 align:start position:0%
must be reported to the Board of
 
04:27:03.540 --> 04:27:04.849 align:start position:0%
must be reported to the Board of
Medicine

04:27:04.849 --> 04:27:04.859 align:start position:0%
Medicine
 
04:27:07.490 --> 04:27:07.500 align:start position:0%
and following
 
04:27:11.630 --> 04:27:11.640 align:start position:0%
review and then I I think I just stick
 
04:27:14.389 --> 04:27:14.399 align:start position:0%
with review following review at the
 
04:27:17.510 --> 04:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine level what
 
04:27:19.910 --> 04:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
must be reported on the board of
 
04:27:25.389 --> 04:27:25.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:25.399 --> 04:27:29.469 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:27:29.469 --> 04:27:29.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:31.790 --> 04:27:31.800 align:start position:0%
loud and clear that we need to work on
 
04:27:32.830 --> 04:27:32.840 align:start position:0%
that more
 
04:27:35.630 --> 04:27:35.640 align:start position:0%
but that that's another thing uh
 
04:27:37.849 --> 04:27:37.859 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy thank you Mr
 
04:27:39.649 --> 04:27:39.659 align:start position:0%
chairman if we're tweaking this um to
 
04:27:41.630 --> 04:27:41.640 align:start position:0%
some degree I would suggest that you
 
04:27:43.910 --> 04:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
know the Board of Medicine I think is
 
04:27:46.070 --> 04:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
their Authority is for licensing not
 
04:27:48.010 --> 04:27:48.020 align:start position:0%
privileging I think that's a hospital
 
04:27:50.269 --> 04:27:50.279 align:start position:0%
chore in the last paragraph
 
04:27:54.610 --> 04:27:54.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:58.490 --> 04:27:58.500 align:start position:0%
because we spoke so about the fact that
 
04:28:00.170 --> 04:28:00.180 align:start position:0%
we want to protect
 
04:28:03.530 --> 04:28:03.540 align:start position:0%
uh providers Physicians pas
 
04:28:06.530 --> 04:28:06.540 align:start position:0%
but also nurse practitioners Etc from uh
 
04:28:07.969 --> 04:28:07.979 align:start position:0%
the frivolous lawsuits and the
 
04:28:09.649 --> 04:28:09.659 align:start position:0%
repercussions of that
 
04:28:12.290 --> 04:28:12.300 align:start position:0%
should we not include at this point any
 
04:28:15.410 --> 04:28:15.420 align:start position:0%
mention of lawsuit settlements because
 
04:28:17.870 --> 04:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
it was brought up by President on and
 
04:28:21.950 --> 04:28:21.960 align:start position:0%
also is that on and we also have
 
04:28:24.590 --> 04:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
providers that you know May
 
04:28:28.010 --> 04:28:28.020 align:start position:0%
reach the level of a suit and have it
 
04:28:30.410 --> 04:28:30.420 align:start position:0%
settled but that should not necessarily
 
04:28:33.550 --> 04:28:33.560 align:start position:0%
be you know Incorporated but that may be
 
04:28:36.170 --> 04:28:36.180 align:start position:0%
encompassed with any you know mentions
 
04:28:38.929 --> 04:28:38.939 align:start position:0%
of malpractice settlement so that's
 
04:28:40.309 --> 04:28:40.319 align:start position:0%
something I think we have to ultimately
 
04:28:42.649 --> 04:28:42.659 align:start position:0%
come to an agreement on as to what gets
 
04:28:44.570 --> 04:28:44.580 align:start position:0%
reported I think you could take a broad
 
04:28:46.429 --> 04:28:46.439 align:start position:0%
stroke and say we're going to report all
 
04:28:46.439 --> 04:28:47.290 align:start position:0%
stroke and say we're going to report all
medical

04:28:47.290 --> 04:28:47.300 align:start position:0%
medical
 
04:28:49.309 --> 04:28:49.319 align:start position:0%
malpractice settlements that may
 
04:28:51.110 --> 04:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
certainly include a lot of good
 
04:28:52.550 --> 04:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
providers and I think we ought to at
 
04:28:54.370 --> 04:28:54.380 align:start position:0%
least table that for now
 
04:28:57.410 --> 04:28:57.420 align:start position:0%
if I'm if I may we don't need to table
 
04:28:59.450 --> 04:28:59.460 align:start position:0%
it I don't think because it's already
 
04:29:01.309 --> 04:29:01.319 align:start position:0%
written in here in a way in which I
 
04:29:02.870 --> 04:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
think you're going to be satisfied if I
 
04:29:07.849 --> 04:29:07.859 align:start position:0%
could explain why on on page three the
 
04:29:11.210 --> 04:29:11.220 align:start position:0%
last paragraph under investigations it
 
04:29:13.370 --> 04:29:13.380 align:start position:0%
goes on to say the board shell exercise
 
04:29:16.309 --> 04:29:16.319 align:start position:0%
due diligence in the next sentence it
 
04:29:18.649 --> 04:29:18.659 align:start position:0%
starts to say the board shall make
 
04:29:20.750 --> 04:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
public all disciplinary actions
 
04:29:23.090 --> 04:29:23.100 align:start position:0%
including involuntary or involuntary
 
04:29:25.130 --> 04:29:25.140 align:start position:0%
restriction of privileges large future
 
04:29:28.910 --> 04:29:28.920 align:start position:0%
and fines so in your scenario where they
 
04:29:31.969 --> 04:29:31.979 align:start position:0%
receive word of a frivolous malpractice
 
04:29:33.830 --> 04:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
case or a case just settled out of court
 
04:29:38.809 --> 04:29:38.819 align:start position:0%
to because of economy then this that
 
04:29:41.809 --> 04:29:41.819 align:start position:0%
then a report of that would not get
 
04:29:45.710 --> 04:29:45.720 align:start position:0%
triggered until or unless there was also
 
04:29:47.630 --> 04:29:47.640 align:start position:0%
an accompanying involuntary restriction
 
04:29:50.570 --> 04:29:50.580 align:start position:0%
of privileges so so although that
 
04:29:53.990 --> 04:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
paragraph doesn't call out malpractice
 
04:29:57.349 --> 04:29:57.359 align:start position:0%
by name it it's it's got the it's got
 
04:29:59.630 --> 04:29:59.640 align:start position:0%
the safety net all underneath it because
 
04:30:02.210 --> 04:30:02.220 align:start position:0%
the the things that get reported are the
 
04:30:05.149 --> 04:30:05.159 align:start position:0%
ones that have resulted in voluntary or
 
04:30:07.070 --> 04:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
involuntary restriction privileges
 
04:30:09.610 --> 04:30:09.620 align:start position:0%
license or spines Etc
 
04:30:13.250 --> 04:30:13.260 align:start position:0%
so I so I was thinking of your point
 
04:30:15.889 --> 04:30:15.899 align:start position:0%
earlier today which triggered me to talk
 
04:30:19.670 --> 04:30:19.680 align:start position:0%
to Dr saloway about it and and and I got
 
04:30:23.290 --> 04:30:23.300 align:start position:0%
comfortable that that paragraph already
 
04:30:26.929 --> 04:30:26.939 align:start position:0%
is has has the malpractice issue uh
 
04:30:29.030 --> 04:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
Incorporated in it without specifically
 
04:30:33.410 --> 04:30:33.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:35.389 --> 04:30:35.399 align:start position:0%
so you're comfortable with the fact that
 
04:30:37.550 --> 04:30:37.560 align:start position:0%
if you put in their exercises due
 
04:30:40.189 --> 04:30:40.199 align:start position:0%
diligence that satisfies your your
 
04:30:42.110 --> 04:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
concerns about having anybody reported
 
04:30:45.889 --> 04:30:45.899 align:start position:0%
that may otherwise be a sound
 
04:30:45.899 --> 04:30:48.969 align:start position:0%
that may otherwise be a sound
practitioner

04:30:48.969 --> 04:30:48.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:52.429 --> 04:30:52.439 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable that well one we have to
 
04:30:55.610 --> 04:30:55.620 align:start position:0%
trust the Board of Medicine so if as
 
04:30:58.929 --> 04:30:58.939 align:start position:0%
long as they're exercising due diligence
 
04:31:02.630 --> 04:31:02.640 align:start position:0%
until they see a need for restriction of
 
04:31:05.389 --> 04:31:05.399 align:start position:0%
privilegious licensures and fines until
 
04:31:08.689 --> 04:31:08.699 align:start position:0%
that point I could understand why it
 
04:31:12.370 --> 04:31:12.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:16.969 --> 04:31:16.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:18.769 --> 04:31:18.779 align:start position:0%
everybody happy with what we're doing
 
04:31:21.649 --> 04:31:21.659 align:start position:0%
with that paragraph
 
04:31:24.530 --> 04:31:24.540 align:start position:0%
anything else we want to change tweak
 
04:31:28.189 --> 04:31:28.199 align:start position:0%
add subtract I I have a few some of them
 
04:31:31.370 --> 04:31:31.380 align:start position:0%
but go into the tiny
 
04:31:31.380 --> 04:31:32.090 align:start position:0%
but go into the tiny
um

04:31:32.090 --> 04:31:32.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:35.269 --> 04:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
pick the Nets on on page
 
04:31:35.279 --> 04:31:36.349 align:start position:0%
pick the Nets on on page
um

04:31:36.349 --> 04:31:36.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:36.359 --> 04:31:37.729 align:start position:0%
um
three

04:31:37.729 --> 04:31:37.739 align:start position:0%
three
 
04:31:40.610 --> 04:31:40.620 align:start position:0%
in the first paragraph our report
 
04:31:43.070 --> 04:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
currently reads the Board of Medicine
 
04:31:45.710 --> 04:31:45.720 align:start position:0%
Showplace prominently on its website a
 
04:31:48.830 --> 04:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
button labeled complaint which will be
 
04:31:51.050 --> 04:31:51.060 align:start position:0%
the access point for anyone who wishes
 
04:31:53.570 --> 04:31:53.580 align:start position:0%
to report a complaint directly to the
 
04:31:56.689 --> 04:31:56.699 align:start position:0%
board I think based on Ms Courtney's
 
04:32:01.670 --> 04:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
testimony that oplc has been decided by
 
04:32:05.570 --> 04:32:05.580 align:start position:0%
the legislature to to to provide the
 
04:32:07.309 --> 04:32:07.319 align:start position:0%
administrative services so I would
 
04:32:07.319 --> 04:32:08.349 align:start position:0%
administrative services so I would
recommend

04:32:08.349 --> 04:32:08.359 align:start position:0%
recommend
 
04:32:11.330 --> 04:32:11.340 align:start position:0%
that we strike out the the portion of
 
04:32:14.330 --> 04:32:14.340 align:start position:0%
that sentence directing or you know
 
04:32:16.370 --> 04:32:16.380 align:start position:0%
intending to direct that the complaint
 
04:32:19.130 --> 04:32:19.140 align:start position:0%
go directly to the board because they
 
04:32:20.510 --> 04:32:20.520 align:start position:0%
already there's already a process
 
04:32:23.210 --> 04:32:23.220 align:start position:0%
there's a data flow so so I would delete
 
04:32:26.570 --> 04:32:26.580 align:start position:0%
like directly to the board
 
04:32:26.580 --> 04:32:28.510 align:start position:0%
like directly to the board

foreign
 
04:32:32.450 --> 04:32:32.460 align:start position:0%
I think in Miss Courtney's testimony she
 
04:32:34.550 --> 04:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
said that a complaintant when they they
 
04:32:37.189 --> 04:32:37.199 align:start position:0%
hit the submit button basically on the
 
04:32:39.649 --> 04:32:39.659 align:start position:0%
Complaint Form they are notified that
 
04:32:42.889 --> 04:32:42.899 align:start position:0%
the complaint has been received if if it
 
04:32:45.469 --> 04:32:45.479 align:start position:0%
does not work that way I I'd like to see
 
04:32:48.050 --> 04:32:48.060 align:start position:0%
that in the report that that the
 
04:32:51.410 --> 04:32:51.420 align:start position:0%
complaintant should receive feedback
 
04:32:53.689 --> 04:32:53.699 align:start position:0%
that their complaint has been dually
 
04:32:53.699 --> 04:32:55.969 align:start position:0%
that their complaint has been dually
received

04:32:55.969 --> 04:32:55.979 align:start position:0%
received
 
04:32:55.979 --> 04:32:59.689 align:start position:0%
received
from

04:33:06.590 --> 04:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
that out because we've been assured that
 
04:33:08.209 --> 04:33:08.219 align:start position:0%
they are told that the complaint has
 
04:33:09.289 --> 04:33:09.299 align:start position:0%
been received
 
04:33:12.529 --> 04:33:12.539 align:start position:0%
I I I I just leave it open I don't I
 
04:33:14.631 --> 04:33:14.641 align:start position:0%
don't know are you sure miss Courtney
 
04:33:16.789 --> 04:33:16.799 align:start position:0%
that they do when they hit some some men
 
04:33:18.470 --> 04:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
on the complaint that they're told that
 
04:33:26.750 --> 04:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:29.929 --> 04:33:29.939 align:start position:0%
all right in that case in that case I'd
 
04:33:31.369 --> 04:33:31.379 align:start position:0%
be glad to have you put it in the report
 
04:33:31.379 --> 04:33:32.869 align:start position:0%
be glad to have you put it in the report
yeah

04:33:32.869 --> 04:33:32.879 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:33:32.879 --> 04:33:40.150 align:start position:0%
yeah
foreign

04:33:40.150 --> 04:33:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:43.209 --> 04:33:43.219 align:start position:0%
board investigation or this new section
 
04:33:46.730 --> 04:33:46.740 align:start position:0%
on Board of Medicine reporting maybe
 
04:33:48.890 --> 04:33:48.900 align:start position:0%
it's the second uh the Board of Medicine
 
04:33:51.109 --> 04:33:51.119 align:start position:0%
I think we should include in our
 
04:33:52.970 --> 04:33:52.980 align:start position:0%
sentence that the final disposition
 
04:33:58.670 --> 04:33:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:02.090 --> 04:34:02.100 align:start position:0%
it doesn't sound like it is now
 
04:34:04.429 --> 04:34:04.439 align:start position:0%
and then under Staffing and funding
 
04:34:06.890 --> 04:34:06.900 align:start position:0%
because I'm again I want to go back to
 
04:34:10.369 --> 04:34:10.379 align:start position:0%
being a retired geek I really would like
 
04:34:13.849 --> 04:34:13.859 align:start position:0%
to in that that line of things that the
 
04:34:16.730 --> 04:34:16.740 align:start position:0%
funding is necessary to staff its
 
04:34:18.830 --> 04:34:18.840 align:start position:0%
responsibilities renumerate volunteer
 
04:34:21.470 --> 04:34:21.480 align:start position:0%
Physicians I would insert in there to
 
04:34:24.830 --> 04:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
mean a simple to use website I I want to
 
04:34:26.929 --> 04:34:26.939 align:start position:0%
call it out that I think we've heard in
 
04:34:29.631 --> 04:34:29.641 align:start position:0%
prior testimony that the website could
 
04:34:31.670 --> 04:34:31.680 align:start position:0%
could use some spiffing up and that we
 
04:34:34.551 --> 04:34:34.561 align:start position:0%
like the the main metaphor Maine's
 
04:34:38.510 --> 04:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:45.170 --> 04:34:45.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:46.849 --> 04:34:46.859 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I'd like to make a motion
 
04:34:50.689 --> 04:34:50.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:52.849 --> 04:34:52.859 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy before he makes a
 
04:34:55.250 --> 04:34:55.260 align:start position:0%
motion oh thank you just a question in
 
04:34:56.689 --> 04:34:56.699 align:start position:0%
the bottom of the first page the
 
04:34:58.490 --> 04:34:58.500 align:start position:0%
paragraph at the bottom
 
04:35:00.289 --> 04:35:00.299 align:start position:0%
um are we staying with the statement
 
04:35:02.029 --> 04:35:02.039 align:start position:0%
each organization shall establish an
 
04:35:04.010 --> 04:35:04.020 align:start position:0%
internal Review Committee
 
04:35:07.250 --> 04:35:07.260 align:start position:0%
um I believe that that's redundant yeah
 
04:35:08.929 --> 04:35:08.939 align:start position:0%
we don't need that because I do believe
 
04:35:10.490 --> 04:35:10.500 align:start position:0%
there's committees in place right now
 
04:35:11.990 --> 04:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
that actually do this work so all right
 
04:35:14.090 --> 04:35:14.100 align:start position:0%
rather than have anybody imply that
 
04:35:16.189 --> 04:35:16.199 align:start position:0%
we're establishing something new
 
04:35:19.609 --> 04:35:19.619 align:start position:0%
okay thank you anybody else want to play
 
04:35:21.590 --> 04:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
with the document before we have a
 
04:35:21.600 --> 04:35:23.269 align:start position:0%
with the document before we have a
motion

04:35:23.269 --> 04:35:23.279 align:start position:0%
motion
 
04:35:26.929 --> 04:35:26.939 align:start position:0%
in which case representative Solway uh
 
04:35:29.150 --> 04:35:29.160 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I would like to move that
 
04:35:31.070 --> 04:35:31.080 align:start position:0%
the report to the oversight committee on
 
04:35:32.029 --> 04:35:32.039 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
04:35:34.429 --> 04:35:34.439 align:start position:0%
Services regarding the issue of
 
04:35:37.609 --> 04:35:37.619 align:start position:0%
transparency and Board of Medicine
 
04:35:39.709 --> 04:35:39.719 align:start position:0%
um be revised according to these
 
04:35:42.769 --> 04:35:42.779 align:start position:0%
comments and remanded to the oversight
 
04:35:46.070 --> 04:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
committee for its further consideration
 
04:35:48.769 --> 04:35:48.779 align:start position:0%
do we have a second representative
 
04:35:51.650 --> 04:35:51.660 align:start position:0%
Murphy any further discussion
 
04:35:55.250 --> 04:35:55.260 align:start position:0%
oversight will next meet on the Friday
 
04:35:58.429 --> 04:35:58.439 align:start position:0%
before Thanksgiving which is the third
 
04:36:01.789 --> 04:36:01.799 align:start position:0%
Friday at one o'clock note the change of
 
04:36:04.551 --> 04:36:04.561 align:start position:0%
date and time and what day in November
 
04:36:08.090 --> 04:36:08.100 align:start position:0%
is that Friday November 18th or 18th
 
04:36:08.100 --> 04:36:10.010 align:start position:0%
is that Friday November 18th or 18th
good

04:36:10.010 --> 04:36:10.020 align:start position:0%
good
 
04:36:11.929 --> 04:36:11.939 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
04:36:14.750 --> 04:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
all in favor of accepting this report as
 
04:36:17.869 --> 04:36:17.879 align:start position:0%
a member uh amended please say aye
 
04:36:20.449 --> 04:36:20.459 align:start position:0%
aye opposed okay thank you very much now
 
04:36:24.289 --> 04:36:24.299 align:start position:0%
we've got that in hand and going forward
 
04:36:27.170 --> 04:36:27.180 align:start position:0%
in terms of lsrs they are not due until
 
04:36:31.131 --> 04:36:31.141 align:start position:0%
the 22nd of November
 
04:36:34.310 --> 04:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
and in the meantime I suspect there will
 
04:36:37.429 --> 04:36:37.439 align:start position:0%
be two kinds of things filed one kind
 
04:36:40.689 --> 04:36:40.699 align:start position:0%
will very simply establish a committee
 
04:36:43.369 --> 04:36:43.379 align:start position:0%
with uh what you and I like to call The
 
04:36:47.689 --> 04:36:47.699 align:start position:0%
Usual Suspects to sit on it uh to go
 
04:36:50.631 --> 04:36:50.641 align:start position:0%
much further in depth if needed and then
 
04:36:53.330 --> 04:36:53.340 align:start position:0%
secondly there may well be an LSR or two
 
04:36:56.150 --> 04:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
that will come out tweaking the report
 
04:36:59.929 --> 04:36:59.939 align:start position:0%
we've just heard it does not have to be
 
04:37:02.209 --> 04:37:02.219 align:start position:0%
approved by oversight we can take the
 
04:37:05.330 --> 04:37:05.340 align:start position:0%
document as revised and disseminated and
 
04:37:08.631 --> 04:37:08.641 align:start position:0%
I suspect that will happen with perhaps
 
04:37:11.330 --> 04:37:11.340 align:start position:0%
input during December and January before
 
04:37:14.209 --> 04:37:14.219 align:start position:0%
those build that bill or those bills
 
04:37:16.670 --> 04:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
wind up at Eda that's what I suspect
 
04:37:18.910 --> 04:37:18.920 align:start position:0%
will go forward and
 
04:37:20.990 --> 04:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
after we've gotten over
 
04:37:22.490 --> 04:37:22.500 align:start position:0%
trick-or-treating maybe we can start
 
04:37:24.650 --> 04:37:24.660 align:start position:0%
working on that if we feel like it
 
04:37:27.650 --> 04:37:27.660 align:start position:0%
uh with that in mind we do have a few
 
04:37:31.070 --> 04:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
people who are from the public and as
 
04:37:34.849 --> 04:37:34.859 align:start position:0%
well as from associations and they've
 
04:37:36.650 --> 04:37:36.660 align:start position:0%
asked to speak and
 
04:37:38.269 --> 04:37:38.279 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to call them up do we have
 
04:37:40.250 --> 04:37:40.260 align:start position:0%
Mr Jim Potter from the New Hampshire
 
04:37:57.109 --> 04:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:57.119 --> 04:37:58.429 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:37:58.429 --> 04:37:58.439 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
04:38:01.131 --> 04:38:01.141 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
04:38:04.189 --> 04:38:04.199 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Jim Potter I
 
04:38:07.189 --> 04:38:07.199 align:start position:0%
Am the CEO of the New Hampshire Medical
 
04:38:07.199 --> 04:38:09.109 align:start position:0%
Am the CEO of the New Hampshire Medical
Society

04:38:09.109 --> 04:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
Society
 
04:38:11.990 --> 04:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
um and today and I would like using an
 
04:38:14.510 --> 04:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
old analogy from past hearing uh kind of
 
04:38:19.010 --> 04:38:19.020 align:start position:0%
backup or reiterate a couple of points
 
04:38:21.769 --> 04:38:21.779 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to revise and narrow my
 
04:38:23.029 --> 04:38:23.039 align:start position:0%
comments and I will send you some of
 
04:38:24.590 --> 04:38:24.600 align:start position:0%
this information
 
04:38:26.929 --> 04:38:26.939 align:start position:0%
um in specific I think to reiterate here
 
04:38:26.939 --> 04:38:28.010 align:start position:0%
um in specific I think to reiterate here
is

04:38:28.010 --> 04:38:28.020 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:38:30.949 --> 04:38:30.959 align:start position:0%
um uh there's been a lack of
 
04:38:32.330 --> 04:38:32.340 align:start position:0%
understanding about these processes
 
04:38:34.070 --> 04:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
which is clear
 
04:38:37.490 --> 04:38:37.500 align:start position:0%
um and as I've said before the medical
 
04:38:40.869 --> 04:38:40.879 align:start position:0%
society is committed itself and funding
 
04:38:43.670 --> 04:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
to establish continuing medical
 
04:38:47.990 --> 04:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
education which we officially did this
 
04:38:49.970 --> 04:38:49.980 align:start position:0%
weekend this past weekend it's a
 
04:38:52.429 --> 04:38:52.439 align:start position:0%
90-minute session that goes into great
 
04:38:55.131 --> 04:38:55.141 align:start position:0%
depth to educate Physicians
 
04:38:56.810 --> 04:38:56.820 align:start position:0%
um and I guess it will be probably
 
04:38:59.689 --> 04:38:59.699 align:start position:0%
others about those processes goes into
 
04:39:01.330 --> 04:39:01.340 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of depth
 
04:39:05.330 --> 04:39:05.340 align:start position:0%
as I said before our greatest concern is
 
04:39:08.689 --> 04:39:08.699 align:start position:0%
we had Physicians because other than a
 
04:39:11.289 --> 04:39:11.299 align:start position:0%
patient dying on them
 
04:39:14.631 --> 04:39:14.641 align:start position:0%
or a bad outcome this is the most
 
04:39:16.369 --> 04:39:16.379 align:start position:0%
traumatic thing that will happen to a
 
04:39:18.170 --> 04:39:18.180 align:start position:0%
physician in their career it doesn't
 
04:39:20.689 --> 04:39:20.699 align:start position:0%
happen very often but it does happen and
 
04:39:23.150 --> 04:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
so we've I have witnessed a lot of
 
04:39:25.010 --> 04:39:25.020 align:start position:0%
Physicians freezing up
 
04:39:27.910 --> 04:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
and and not responding as you've heard
 
04:39:31.631 --> 04:39:31.641 align:start position:0%
all complaints get investigations
 
04:39:34.910 --> 04:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
and Physicians who have a complaint
 
04:39:38.030 --> 04:39:38.040 align:start position:0%
whether it's from an individual or a
 
04:39:41.690 --> 04:39:41.700 align:start position:0%
hospital medical staff or a hospital all
 
04:39:44.330 --> 04:39:44.340 align:start position:0%
those have to be responded to by that
 
04:39:46.670 --> 04:39:46.680 align:start position:0%
physician often what we've seen is
 
04:39:48.410 --> 04:39:48.420 align:start position:0%
Physicians would just freeze up and not
 
04:39:50.990 --> 04:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
respond and so it kicks them down a
 
04:39:53.030 --> 04:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
level to a very full and rigorous
 
04:39:56.690 --> 04:39:56.700 align:start position:0%
Hearing in many cases wasn't needed so
 
04:39:58.070 --> 04:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
that's why we want to make sure when
 
04:39:59.930 --> 04:39:59.940 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of transparency going on
 
04:40:03.110 --> 04:40:03.120 align:start position:0%
and just from your level of knowledge
 
04:40:06.288 --> 04:40:06.298 align:start position:0%
about I think it it will be helpful for
 
04:40:08.690 --> 04:40:08.700 align:start position:0%
us to take and we'll continue to revise
 
04:40:11.270 --> 04:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
to simplify to make sure that these
 
04:40:14.990 --> 04:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
processes are well understood by
 
04:40:16.630 --> 04:40:16.640 align:start position:0%
everyone involved
 
04:40:19.850 --> 04:40:19.860 align:start position:0%
because I've heard others get appear and
 
04:40:22.368 --> 04:40:22.378 align:start position:0%
testify that there are the none of these
 
04:40:25.130 --> 04:40:25.140 align:start position:0%
processes in place these these process
 
04:40:26.990 --> 04:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
should mirror what the attorneys are
 
04:40:27.000 --> 04:40:27.830 align:start position:0%
should mirror what the attorneys are
doing

04:40:27.830 --> 04:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
doing
 
04:40:30.110 --> 04:40:30.120 align:start position:0%
and the first thing I want to reiterate
 
04:40:33.230 --> 04:40:33.240 align:start position:0%
is one there is clearly a rigorous and
 
04:40:35.690 --> 04:40:35.700 align:start position:0%
active investigation process for all
 
04:40:35.700 --> 04:40:37.190 align:start position:0%
active investigation process for all
complaints

04:40:37.190 --> 04:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
complaints
 
04:40:39.050 --> 04:40:39.060 align:start position:0%
um brought for the board revocation in
 
04:40:42.050 --> 04:40:42.060 align:start position:0%
this discipline by other states
 
04:40:45.190 --> 04:40:45.200 align:start position:0%
um that and and those move forward in
 
04:40:47.868 --> 04:40:47.878 align:start position:0%
the process that you kind of have the
 
04:40:49.850 --> 04:40:49.860 align:start position:0%
the nice little
 
04:40:52.070 --> 04:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
a chart on
 
04:40:54.530 --> 04:40:54.540 align:start position:0%
um second I want to put that all medical
 
04:40:57.230 --> 04:40:57.240 align:start position:0%
staff discipline
 
04:40:59.930 --> 04:40:59.940 align:start position:0%
actions are reported to the board and I
 
04:41:01.490 --> 04:41:01.500 align:start position:0%
think what I want to clarify I didn't
 
04:41:04.130 --> 04:41:04.140 align:start position:0%
hear is the board treats those just like
 
04:41:07.330 --> 04:41:07.340 align:start position:0%
a complaint those are all investigated
 
04:41:10.670 --> 04:41:10.680 align:start position:0%
they require a response from a physician
 
04:41:13.850 --> 04:41:13.860 align:start position:0%
so I don't see it uh respectfully I
 
04:41:16.250 --> 04:41:16.260 align:start position:0%
don't see that as a whole because the
 
04:41:18.410 --> 04:41:18.420 align:start position:0%
board just takes and excellent opens up
 
04:41:20.868 --> 04:41:20.878 align:start position:0%
an investigation on that just like they
 
04:41:22.670 --> 04:41:22.680 align:start position:0%
would any other complaint
 
04:41:25.430 --> 04:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
um so it goes through that process they
 
04:41:27.830 --> 04:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
could go through and say because of the
 
04:41:30.770 --> 04:41:30.780 align:start position:0%
level of that we're not going to take
 
04:41:33.830 --> 04:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
any action at this time now it has come
 
04:41:38.628 --> 04:41:38.638 align:start position:0%
where maybe behavior elapses and repeats
 
04:41:38.638 --> 04:41:39.670 align:start position:0%
where maybe behavior elapses and repeats
itself

04:41:39.670 --> 04:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
itself
 
04:41:41.810 --> 04:41:41.820 align:start position:0%
often I've seen a couple of those cases
 
04:41:43.430 --> 04:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
where it comes back and the board does
 
04:41:45.590 --> 04:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
take action on those so I don't
 
04:41:47.930 --> 04:41:47.940 align:start position:0%
necessarily see it as is described as a
 
04:41:51.288 --> 04:41:51.298 align:start position:0%
whole but it's just another part of the
 
04:41:53.270 --> 04:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
investigation process that is required
 
04:41:55.550 --> 04:41:55.560 align:start position:0%
on any complaint any action that comes
 
04:41:57.170 --> 04:41:57.180 align:start position:0%
to them
 
04:41:57.180 --> 04:41:58.490 align:start position:0%
to them
um

04:41:58.490 --> 04:41:58.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:02.570 --> 04:42:02.580 align:start position:0%
third uh we have done some work with the
 
04:42:05.448 --> 04:42:05.458 align:start position:0%
Federation of State Medical boards and
 
04:42:08.750 --> 04:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
there are a number of levels there is an
 
04:42:11.510 --> 04:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
analysis chart that describes what is
 
04:42:14.930 --> 04:42:14.940 align:start position:0%
reported by each board and there's
 
04:42:18.590 --> 04:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
there's actually 67 boards because uh
 
04:42:22.128 --> 04:42:22.138 align:start position:0%
other than the the 52 kind of allopathic
 
04:42:24.590 --> 04:42:24.600 align:start position:0%
ports there's another 15 osteopathic
 
04:42:27.288 --> 04:42:27.298 align:start position:0%
boards in some states so there's a the
 
04:42:31.490 --> 04:42:31.500 align:start position:0%
the number the the nominator is 67. and
 
04:42:33.948 --> 04:42:33.958 align:start position:0%
of that number only 19 published
 
04:42:35.930 --> 04:42:35.940 align:start position:0%
Hospital disciplinary actions
 
04:42:38.448 --> 04:42:38.458 align:start position:0%
and again that's where there would be a
 
04:42:40.250 --> 04:42:40.260 align:start position:0%
difference is the board acting on that
 
04:42:42.350 --> 04:42:42.360 align:start position:0%
now we can follow up with you and we can
 
04:42:43.788 --> 04:42:43.798 align:start position:0%
probably get you some of that nuanced
 
04:42:45.050 --> 04:42:45.060 align:start position:0%
information what are the differences
 
04:42:47.030 --> 04:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
between the states
 
04:42:49.550 --> 04:42:49.560 align:start position:0%
um uh 23 uh published out of state
 
04:42:53.270 --> 04:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
actions uh 25 uh publish criminal
 
04:42:56.330 --> 04:42:56.340 align:start position:0%
convictions and 27 published malpractice
 
04:42:58.850 --> 04:42:58.860 align:start position:0%
settlements that the board has acted on
 
04:43:03.288 --> 04:43:03.298 align:start position:0%
only 27 out of 66 67 I'm sorry so I just
 
04:43:05.990 --> 04:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to frame that for you because
 
04:43:08.690 --> 04:43:08.700 align:start position:0%
again I think the the rush to judgment
 
04:43:12.470 --> 04:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
here is well everyone else is doing this
 
04:43:15.050 --> 04:43:15.060 align:start position:0%
and it's it's it's all it's all over the
 
04:43:17.990 --> 04:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
place it's it doesn't happen if at some
 
04:43:20.510 --> 04:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
point you would choose to say well we're
 
04:43:22.970 --> 04:43:22.980 align:start position:0%
going to consider uh having malpractice
 
04:43:26.930 --> 04:43:26.940 align:start position:0%
lawsuits um in there then the states of
 
04:43:31.250 --> 04:43:31.260 align:start position:0%
Vermont and uh Massachusetts actually
 
04:43:33.708 --> 04:43:33.718 align:start position:0%
have six conditions that they publish
 
04:43:36.050 --> 04:43:36.060 align:start position:0%
right up front and say here are a number
 
04:43:38.570 --> 04:43:38.580 align:start position:0%
of things you really have to consider I
 
04:43:41.208 --> 04:43:41.218 align:start position:0%
won't enumerate those to you but they
 
04:43:43.310 --> 04:43:43.320 align:start position:0%
they essentially are a watch that that
 
04:43:45.830 --> 04:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
has been repeated often here a lawsuit
 
04:43:48.110 --> 04:43:48.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that they're skilled or
 
04:43:52.550 --> 04:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
error that has gone into it so that's
 
04:43:54.170 --> 04:43:54.180 align:start position:0%
kind of part and parcel part of the
 
04:43:56.868 --> 04:43:56.878 align:start position:0%
education process if you choose to to go
 
04:43:59.030 --> 04:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
in that direction
 
04:43:59.040 --> 04:44:01.510 align:start position:0%
in that direction
um

04:44:01.510 --> 04:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:04.368 --> 04:44:04.378 align:start position:0%
finally I just wanted to
 
04:44:07.910 --> 04:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
um touch upon well I got those two
 
04:44:09.410 --> 04:44:09.420 align:start position:0%
um I understand your report is going
 
04:44:13.610 --> 04:44:13.620 align:start position:0%
forward I think I the your last point I
 
04:44:14.868 --> 04:44:14.878 align:start position:0%
get item D
 
04:44:16.910 --> 04:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
um and the section about funding is
 
04:44:16.920 --> 04:44:18.110 align:start position:0%
um and the section about funding is
necessary

04:44:18.110 --> 04:44:18.120 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
04:44:20.090 --> 04:44:20.100 align:start position:0%
um I watch as a third party I
 
04:44:21.948 --> 04:44:21.958 align:start position:0%
participate in just about all the Board
 
04:44:24.530 --> 04:44:24.540 align:start position:0%
of Medicine uh hearings
 
04:44:26.750 --> 04:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
um I will do for the record we don't get
 
04:44:29.270 --> 04:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
involved in any of the cases some states
 
04:44:31.430 --> 04:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
do some states molecular societies get
 
04:44:34.368 --> 04:44:34.378 align:start position:0%
and represent Physicians we choose not
 
04:44:37.368 --> 04:44:37.378 align:start position:0%
to do that our focus is really on
 
04:44:40.310 --> 04:44:40.320 align:start position:0%
process is the process transparent is it
 
04:44:42.650 --> 04:44:42.660 align:start position:0%
working you know can we do that and so
 
04:44:46.070 --> 04:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
that's where we tend to help with those
 
04:44:48.110 --> 04:44:48.120 align:start position:0%
type of things and move that forward so
 
04:44:49.970 --> 04:44:49.980 align:start position:0%
I often will report to the board on
 
04:44:52.190 --> 04:44:52.200 align:start position:0%
various of these process issues and how
 
04:44:54.050 --> 04:44:54.060 align:start position:0%
things are moving often how things are
 
04:44:56.150 --> 04:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
moving here in the legislature and
 
04:44:57.770 --> 04:44:57.780 align:start position:0%
whether or not they should engage on
 
04:44:59.868 --> 04:44:59.878 align:start position:0%
certain issues that may or may not be
 
04:45:01.190 --> 04:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
germane to them
 
04:45:03.770 --> 04:45:03.780 align:start position:0%
so I think that's an important that's
 
04:45:05.690 --> 04:45:05.700 align:start position:0%
something an issue on funding is
 
04:45:07.070 --> 04:45:07.080 align:start position:0%
something that I've heard the board
 
04:45:08.750 --> 04:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
specifically ask for for the last couple
 
04:45:08.760 --> 04:45:09.530 align:start position:0%
specifically ask for for the last couple
years

04:45:09.530 --> 04:45:09.540 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:45:10.670 --> 04:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
um I think we've gone through a couple
 
04:45:14.390 --> 04:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
part-time physician investigators
 
04:45:16.610 --> 04:45:16.620 align:start position:0%
um and there hasn't been a steady staff
 
04:45:20.030 --> 04:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
of attorney investigators there so I
 
04:45:23.208 --> 04:45:23.218 align:start position:0%
think beefing that up through a little
 
04:45:25.610 --> 04:45:25.620 align:start position:0%
financial assistance through oplc and
 
04:45:28.010 --> 04:45:28.020 align:start position:0%
their request I think is a thing that
 
04:45:29.628 --> 04:45:29.638 align:start position:0%
I've heard is a necessary thing that
 
04:45:32.208 --> 04:45:32.218 align:start position:0%
will help essentially move processes
 
04:45:35.690 --> 04:45:35.700 align:start position:0%
much more expediently as we move forward
 
04:45:38.150 --> 04:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
um and and whatever you decide to do or
 
04:45:41.208 --> 04:45:41.218 align:start position:0%
don't and with that I guess the other
 
04:45:42.288 --> 04:45:42.298 align:start position:0%
thing I could have described myself
 
04:45:43.910 --> 04:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
instead of a backup and I could have
 
04:45:45.890 --> 04:45:45.900 align:start position:0%
taken from a defensive and I could have
 
04:45:47.090 --> 04:45:47.100 align:start position:0%
said because of Halloween you could
 
04:45:48.530 --> 04:45:48.540 align:start position:0%
consider me the monster man here
 
04:45:51.708 --> 04:45:51.718 align:start position:0%
cleaning up but that's a bad joke thank
 
04:45:51.718 --> 04:45:55.368 align:start position:0%
cleaning up but that's a bad joke thank
you

04:45:55.368 --> 04:45:55.378 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:58.128 --> 04:45:58.138 align:start position:0%
too much
 
04:46:01.010 --> 04:46:01.020 align:start position:0%
any question any questions I I have one
 
04:46:03.050 --> 04:46:03.060 align:start position:0%
I assume you've gotten the draft that
 
04:46:05.510 --> 04:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
that Dr saloway has published and under
 
04:46:08.448 --> 04:46:08.458 align:start position:0%
the Staffing and funding section uh this
 
04:46:10.730 --> 04:46:10.740 align:start position:0%
this this is this is pretty minimalistic
 
04:46:13.490 --> 04:46:13.500 align:start position:0%
and you said we should beef it up I
 
04:46:15.650 --> 04:46:15.660 align:start position:0%
would just invite you if you have
 
04:46:18.230 --> 04:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
alternative or additional language that
 
04:46:22.190 --> 04:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
you provided specifically so that uh Dr
 
04:46:24.830 --> 04:46:24.840 align:start position:0%
salowick could look at it and maybe you
 
04:46:27.050 --> 04:46:27.060 align:start position:0%
know keep it in a file at least yeah
 
04:46:28.788 --> 04:46:28.798 align:start position:0%
when you're talking about funding it is
 
04:46:30.288 --> 04:46:30.298 align:start position:0%
not the Board of Medicine that funds
 
04:46:30.298 --> 04:46:31.070 align:start position:0%
not the Board of Medicine that funds
this

04:46:31.070 --> 04:46:31.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:46:32.868 --> 04:46:32.878 align:start position:0%
um all the funding quests come through
 
04:46:34.788 --> 04:46:34.798 align:start position:0%
the office of professional life
 
04:46:36.470 --> 04:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
insurance you know we got that but it
 
04:46:38.750 --> 04:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
sounded like you you know I I just think
 
04:46:40.910 --> 04:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
that there is there's professional staff
 
04:46:42.708 --> 04:46:42.718 align:start position:0%
dedicated to this so a full-time
 
04:46:44.810 --> 04:46:44.820 align:start position:0%
physician investigator and then probably
 
04:46:48.110 --> 04:46:48.120 align:start position:0%
multiple attorney investigators that
 
04:46:50.868 --> 04:46:50.878 align:start position:0%
have been requested to try to move the
 
04:46:53.570 --> 04:46:53.580 align:start position:0%
case loads on an expedient basis
 
04:46:57.650 --> 04:46:57.660 align:start position:0%
um uh so uh my my request is to honor
 
04:47:00.530 --> 04:47:00.540 align:start position:0%
you know whatever oplc comes forward and
 
04:47:02.330 --> 04:47:02.340 align:start position:0%
that hopefully reflects what the Board
 
04:47:06.050 --> 04:47:06.060 align:start position:0%
of Medicine has been asking that through
 
04:47:08.930 --> 04:47:08.940 align:start position:0%
the budgetary process this year so not
 
04:47:10.730 --> 04:47:10.740 align:start position:0%
necessarily part of this report but part
 
04:47:12.250 --> 04:47:12.260 align:start position:0%
of the budgetary
 
04:47:15.170 --> 04:47:15.180 align:start position:0%
request that comes forward I would just
 
04:47:17.750 --> 04:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
ask that you honor and push for that as
 
04:47:20.270 --> 04:47:20.280 align:start position:0%
part of your your ongoing activities
 
04:47:22.788 --> 04:47:22.798 align:start position:0%
although you may not be part of that the
 
04:47:24.170 --> 04:47:24.180 align:start position:0%
chairman would like to request the
 
04:47:26.090 --> 04:47:26.100 align:start position:0%
chairman of finance division three to
 
04:47:27.470 --> 04:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
make sure the money gets put in the
 
04:47:27.480 --> 04:47:29.510 align:start position:0%
make sure the money gets put in the
budget

04:47:29.510 --> 04:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
budget
 
04:47:34.208 --> 04:47:34.218 align:start position:0%
you will consider it thank you very much
 
04:47:37.128 --> 04:47:37.138 align:start position:0%
it just seems to me that everything we
 
04:47:40.128 --> 04:47:40.138 align:start position:0%
just said is really already in there
 
04:47:44.810 --> 04:47:44.820 align:start position:0%
because uh there is uh additional
 
04:47:48.170 --> 04:47:48.180 align:start position:0%
funding as necessary and there's a lot
 
04:47:50.150 --> 04:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
of things in there that we seem to have
 
04:47:52.850 --> 04:47:52.860 align:start position:0%
indicated or necessary so I don't think
 
04:47:54.890 --> 04:47:54.900 align:start position:0%
that any further revision is required
 
04:47:58.910 --> 04:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
because it's I think it's in there
 
04:48:00.590 --> 04:48:00.600 align:start position:0%
thank you right
 
04:48:03.410 --> 04:48:03.420 align:start position:0%
how did Nebraska do on Saturday this is
 
04:48:05.810 --> 04:48:05.820 align:start position:0%
a football question Williams finally won
 
04:48:08.628 --> 04:48:08.638 align:start position:0%
a game Michigan did better better
 
04:48:10.970 --> 04:48:10.980 align:start position:0%
yeah in the fight of the game
 
04:48:12.650 --> 04:48:12.660 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your time I
 
04:48:16.010 --> 04:48:16.020 align:start position:0%
appreciate it bye-bye chair wishes to
 
04:48:26.510 --> 04:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:30.530 --> 04:48:30.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:30.540 --> 04:48:34.090 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:48:34.090 --> 04:48:34.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:36.830 --> 04:48:36.840 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Melissa Hanlon
 
04:48:38.868 --> 04:48:38.878 align:start position:0%
I'm an attorney at Solway and Hollis uh
 
04:48:40.310 --> 04:48:40.320 align:start position:0%
here in Concord where I've had the
 
04:48:42.170 --> 04:48:42.180 align:start position:0%
privilege of representing Physicians and
 
04:48:44.810 --> 04:48:44.820 align:start position:0%
hospitals in malpractice cases and
 
04:48:47.750 --> 04:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
Regulatory matters for the past 20 years
 
04:48:49.850 --> 04:48:49.860 align:start position:0%
um I submitted my written testimony to
 
04:48:51.050 --> 04:48:51.060 align:start position:0%
the members in the committee last
 
04:48:53.270 --> 04:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
evening and I am mindful of your time
 
04:48:54.830 --> 04:48:54.840 align:start position:0%
constraints and that some of the
 
04:48:56.868 --> 04:48:56.878 align:start position:0%
material I submitted has already been
 
04:48:56.878 --> 04:48:57.890 align:start position:0%
material I submitted has already been
covered

04:48:57.890 --> 04:48:57.900 align:start position:0%
covered
 
04:49:01.070 --> 04:49:01.080 align:start position:0%
so um at my own Peril I'm going to skip
 
04:49:01.080 --> 04:49:02.448 align:start position:0%
so um at my own Peril I'm going to skip
ahead

04:49:02.448 --> 04:49:02.458 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
04:49:02.458 --> 04:49:02.990 align:start position:0%
ahead
um

04:49:02.990 --> 04:49:03.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:04.670 --> 04:49:04.680 align:start position:0%
one of the things I wanted to bring to
 
04:49:06.830 --> 04:49:06.840 align:start position:0%
the table was the perspective of the
 
04:49:08.270 --> 04:49:08.280 align:start position:0%
physician who's going through this
 
04:49:08.280 --> 04:49:09.530 align:start position:0%
physician who's going through this
process

04:49:09.530 --> 04:49:09.540 align:start position:0%
process
 
04:49:11.628 --> 04:49:11.638 align:start position:0%
um and I wanted to highlight that being
 
04:49:13.550 --> 04:49:13.560 align:start position:0%
named in a lawsuit or investigated by
 
04:49:15.350 --> 04:49:15.360 align:start position:0%
the Board of Medicine is an incredibly
 
04:49:17.510 --> 04:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
personal stressful and traumatic
 
04:49:20.690 --> 04:49:20.700 align:start position:0%
experience for my clients as Physicians
 
04:49:22.910 --> 04:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying that to minimize the
 
04:49:24.470 --> 04:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
experience of plaintiffs in the process
 
04:49:26.810 --> 04:49:26.820 align:start position:0%
but to emphasize that it is just as
 
04:49:28.730 --> 04:49:28.740 align:start position:0%
personal for my clients as it is for the
 
04:49:31.010 --> 04:49:31.020 align:start position:0%
plaintiffs Physicians went to medical
 
04:49:33.190 --> 04:49:33.200 align:start position:0%
school to help people plain and simple
 
04:49:37.730 --> 04:49:37.740 align:start position:0%
and we heard in Prior days that most of
 
04:49:39.590 --> 04:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
the lawsuits filed are meritorious
 
04:49:42.830 --> 04:49:42.840 align:start position:0%
because they've been reviewed in advance
 
04:49:45.288 --> 04:49:45.298 align:start position:0%
um I think that's a misconception
 
04:49:47.750 --> 04:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
um there is no statutory requirement
 
04:49:49.850 --> 04:49:49.860 align:start position:0%
that plaintiff's lawyers get the case
 
04:49:51.650 --> 04:49:51.660 align:start position:0%
reviewed by an expert in advance of
 
04:49:53.090 --> 04:49:53.100 align:start position:0%
filing the case
 
04:49:55.128 --> 04:49:55.138 align:start position:0%
there is a requirement to get to the
 
04:49:57.230 --> 04:49:57.240 align:start position:0%
jury that they have a qualified expert
 
04:49:58.910 --> 04:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
to testify on standard of care and
 
04:50:01.610 --> 04:50:01.620 align:start position:0%
causation every year in my practice I
 
04:50:03.890 --> 04:50:03.900 align:start position:0%
see cases dropped by even well-regarded
 
04:50:05.510 --> 04:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
plaintiffs firms in the state because
 
04:50:08.208 --> 04:50:08.218 align:start position:0%
they lack expert support so I want to
 
04:50:10.010 --> 04:50:10.020 align:start position:0%
emphasize that as you consider
 
04:50:12.230 --> 04:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
publicizing just the existence of a
 
04:50:14.628 --> 04:50:14.638 align:start position:0%
lawsuit against a physician I think we
 
04:50:17.390 --> 04:50:17.400 align:start position:0%
pretty much are a unanimous agreement we
 
04:50:17.400 --> 04:50:19.730 align:start position:0%
pretty much are a unanimous agreement we
won't

04:50:19.730 --> 04:50:19.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:19.740 --> 04:50:24.770 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:50:24.770 --> 04:50:24.780 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:26.690 --> 04:50:26.700 align:start position:0%
I also want to talk about settlements
 
04:50:28.070 --> 04:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
and just emphasize that there are a
 
04:50:30.110 --> 04:50:30.120 align:start position:0%
variety of reasons why Physicians cases
 
04:50:30.120 --> 04:50:31.190 align:start position:0%
variety of reasons why Physicians cases
settled

04:50:31.190 --> 04:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
settled
 
04:50:33.050 --> 04:50:33.060 align:start position:0%
um the first is of course the expert
 
04:50:34.910 --> 04:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
feedback we get on the standard of care
 
04:50:36.530 --> 04:50:36.540 align:start position:0%
and causation
 
04:50:38.208 --> 04:50:38.218 align:start position:0%
um the second is what I'll call the
 
04:50:40.730 --> 04:50:40.740 align:start position:0%
sympathy Factor so there are some cases
 
04:50:42.590 --> 04:50:42.600 align:start position:0%
even though we have solid expert support
 
04:50:44.330 --> 04:50:44.340 align:start position:0%
either the circumstances or the
 
04:50:46.250 --> 04:50:46.260 align:start position:0%
plaintiff is incredibly compelling and
 
04:50:48.530 --> 04:50:48.540 align:start position:0%
sympathetic and there's concerns about
 
04:50:50.570 --> 04:50:50.580 align:start position:0%
bringing that to a jury
 
04:50:52.128 --> 04:50:52.138 align:start position:0%
um the third is simply a business
 
04:50:55.250 --> 04:50:55.260 align:start position:0%
decision so sometimes the institution or
 
04:50:58.970 --> 04:50:58.980 align:start position:0%
the insurance company decides that it is
 
04:50:58.980 --> 04:50:59.570 align:start position:0%
the insurance company decides that it is
um

04:50:59.570 --> 04:50:59.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:51:01.850 --> 04:51:01.860 align:start position:0%
cost less time and money to settle a
 
04:51:04.970 --> 04:51:04.980 align:start position:0%
case than to proceed to trial and I want
 
04:51:07.670 --> 04:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
to emphasize also that Physicians do not
 
04:51:09.470 --> 04:51:09.480 align:start position:0%
always control the decision to settle
 
04:51:11.208 --> 04:51:11.218 align:start position:0%
their case and in fact it's becoming
 
04:51:13.310 --> 04:51:13.320 align:start position:0%
increasingly rare for them to have a say
 
04:51:14.930 --> 04:51:14.940 align:start position:0%
in that decision
 
04:51:14.940 --> 04:51:15.590 align:start position:0%
in that decision
um

04:51:15.590 --> 04:51:15.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:51:18.288 --> 04:51:18.298 align:start position:0%
next insurance policy limits if you have
 
04:51:21.050 --> 04:51:21.060 align:start position:0%
a case where the damages are extremely
 
04:51:22.850 --> 04:51:22.860 align:start position:0%
high either because the medical bills
 
04:51:24.650 --> 04:51:24.660 align:start position:0%
are high or the paper the plaintiff
 
04:51:26.810 --> 04:51:26.820 align:start position:0%
requires ongoing care that needs to be
 
04:51:26.820 --> 04:51:27.830 align:start position:0%
requires ongoing care that needs to be
funded

04:51:27.830 --> 04:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
funded
 
04:51:31.070 --> 04:51:31.080 align:start position:0%
and the physician has a insurance policy
 
04:51:33.830 --> 04:51:33.840 align:start position:0%
that has a lower limit then we have to
 
04:51:35.208 --> 04:51:35.218 align:start position:0%
settle the case to protect the
 
04:51:38.030 --> 04:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
physician's assets and then finally the
 
04:51:39.770 --> 04:51:39.780 align:start position:0%
emotional fortitude of the physician to
 
04:51:41.448 --> 04:51:41.458 align:start position:0%
participate in the litigation and trial
 
04:51:44.208 --> 04:51:44.218 align:start position:0%
so all the time I have clients who say
 
04:51:46.190 --> 04:51:46.200 align:start position:0%
to me you know what Melissa I can't
 
04:51:48.530 --> 04:51:48.540 align:start position:0%
handle the stress of this case I really
 
04:51:50.868 --> 04:51:50.878 align:start position:0%
want you to make it go away or I'm
 
04:51:52.670 --> 04:51:52.680 align:start position:0%
enjoying my retirement I don't want to
 
04:51:55.368 --> 04:51:55.378 align:start position:0%
deal with this or I've moved to
 
04:51:57.350 --> 04:51:57.360 align:start position:0%
California I don't want to be embroiled
 
04:52:00.110 --> 04:52:00.120 align:start position:0%
in a case in New Hampshire anymore
 
04:52:01.910 --> 04:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
um so in other words a settlement does
 
04:52:03.230 --> 04:52:03.240 align:start position:0%
not mean that the physician was
 
04:52:05.868 --> 04:52:05.878 align:start position:0%
necessarily negligent let alone subject
 
04:52:07.310 --> 04:52:07.320 align:start position:0%
to discipline by the New Hampshire Board
 
04:52:09.470 --> 04:52:09.480 align:start position:0%
of Medicine
 
04:52:11.448 --> 04:52:11.458 align:start position:0%
I included my written testimony a
 
04:52:12.708 --> 04:52:12.718 align:start position:0%
detailed description of some of the
 
04:52:14.628 --> 04:52:14.638 align:start position:0%
consequences for a physician of
 
04:52:17.270 --> 04:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
settlements National Practitioner Data
 
04:52:20.390 --> 04:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
Bank entries which can pile up if
 
04:52:21.948 --> 04:52:21.958 align:start position:0%
there's discipline in the reciprocal
 
04:52:21.958 --> 04:52:22.970 align:start position:0%
there's discipline in the reciprocal
discipline

04:52:22.970 --> 04:52:22.980 align:start position:0%
discipline
 
04:52:24.948 --> 04:52:24.958 align:start position:0%
but I think a little-known consequence
 
04:52:26.448 --> 04:52:26.458 align:start position:0%
is de-credentialing by insurance
 
04:52:28.550 --> 04:52:28.560 align:start position:0%
companies so what we're seeing is
 
04:52:30.350 --> 04:52:30.360 align:start position:0%
medical malpractice insurance companies
 
04:52:32.810 --> 04:52:32.820 align:start position:0%
if there's discipline action or a
 
04:52:34.490 --> 04:52:34.500 align:start position:0%
particularly High settlement coming in
 
04:52:36.830 --> 04:52:36.840 align:start position:0%
and saying we're going to look at
 
04:52:38.990 --> 04:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
whether we want this doctor on the panel
 
04:52:41.030 --> 04:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
of Physicians approved to care for our
 
04:52:44.030 --> 04:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
patients if you're a hospital-based
 
04:52:45.530 --> 04:52:45.540 align:start position:0%
physician in a state like New Hampshire
 
04:52:47.930 --> 04:52:47.940 align:start position:0%
where we have a small number of medical
 
04:52:50.448 --> 04:52:50.458 align:start position:0%
insurance companies working and you get
 
04:52:51.830 --> 04:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
the credentialed that's a career
 
04:52:55.368 --> 04:52:55.378 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:57.470 --> 04:52:57.480 align:start position:0%
um if you could wrap it up give us one
 
04:52:59.570 --> 04:52:59.580 align:start position:0%
more point we'll read your testimony and
 
04:53:01.970 --> 04:53:01.980 align:start position:0%
you underscore a lot of what we've been
 
04:53:04.910 --> 04:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
hearing over the last three sessions so
 
04:53:06.948 --> 04:53:06.958 align:start position:0%
my final point I'd like to emphasize is
 
04:53:09.770 --> 04:53:09.780 align:start position:0%
that I am concerned about
 
04:53:12.410 --> 04:53:12.420 align:start position:0%
um any of the changes that you folks um
 
04:53:15.410 --> 04:53:15.420 align:start position:0%
decide to proceed with being implemented
 
04:53:17.690 --> 04:53:17.700 align:start position:0%
on a retrospective basis rather than a
 
04:53:19.970 --> 04:53:19.980 align:start position:0%
prospective basis so I think In fairness
 
04:53:22.190 --> 04:53:22.200 align:start position:0%
to Physicians who have gone through this
 
04:53:24.288 --> 04:53:24.298 align:start position:0%
experience this should be undertaken
 
04:53:26.390 --> 04:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
prospectively and with that I'll accept
 
04:53:28.310 --> 04:53:28.320 align:start position:0%
questions I think that was a very very
 
04:53:30.190 --> 04:53:30.200 align:start position:0%
good point your last one any questions
 
04:53:32.750 --> 04:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
representative Weber I was just going to
 
04:53:34.850 --> 04:53:34.860 align:start position:0%
say I don't think we have the ability to
 
04:53:37.490 --> 04:53:37.500 align:start position:0%
do it retrospectively so I think in your
 
04:53:39.050 --> 04:53:39.060 align:start position:0%
report at least you're asking the board
 
04:53:41.330 --> 04:53:41.340 align:start position:0%
to retrospectively publish malpractice
 
04:53:41.340 --> 04:53:42.830 align:start position:0%
to retrospectively publish malpractice
cases

04:53:42.830 --> 04:53:42.840 align:start position:0%
cases
 
04:53:48.288 --> 04:53:48.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:50.810 --> 04:53:50.820 align:start position:0%
sure could you could you be more clear
 
04:53:53.150 --> 04:53:53.160 align:start position:0%
exactly which sentence you think says
 
04:53:55.788 --> 04:53:55.798 align:start position:0%
that uh I did not bring my copy of the
 
04:53:59.470 --> 04:53:59.480 align:start position:0%
report with me hold on all right
 
04:54:02.270 --> 04:54:02.280 align:start position:0%
it would include any malpractice so it's
 
04:54:04.128 --> 04:54:04.138 align:start position:0%
found in favor of the plaintiff over the
 
04:54:06.650 --> 04:54:06.660 align:start position:0%
past 10 years First full paragraph first
 
04:54:09.430 --> 04:54:09.440 align:start position:0%
sentence or um page two
 
04:54:12.410 --> 04:54:12.420 align:start position:0%
yeah when I read that what the way I
 
04:54:15.350 --> 04:54:15.360 align:start position:0%
interpreted that is to say that once
 
04:54:17.690 --> 04:54:17.700 align:start position:0%
this change is in place then a 10-year
 
04:54:21.490 --> 04:54:21.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:24.830 --> 04:54:24.840 align:start position:0%
yeah I I and I heard testimony asking
 
04:54:26.510 --> 04:54:26.520 align:start position:0%
you to go back and retrospectively
 
04:54:29.030 --> 04:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
publish malpractice data so I did read
 
04:54:31.788 --> 04:54:31.798 align:start position:0%
that to be to be oh you should you're a
 
04:54:34.910 --> 04:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
lawyer okay you did say one thing that
 
04:54:37.128 --> 04:54:37.138 align:start position:0%
through your whole testimony into doubt
 
04:54:38.628 --> 04:54:38.638 align:start position:0%
though when you said that you knew of
 
04:54:40.190 --> 04:54:40.200 align:start position:0%
people moving from New Hampshire to
 
04:54:40.200 --> 04:54:44.890 align:start position:0%
people moving from New Hampshire to
California

04:54:44.890 --> 04:54:44.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:48.948 --> 04:54:48.958 align:start position:0%
this tweak on page two that that
 
04:54:51.708 --> 04:54:51.718 align:start position:0%
sentence includes language that
 
04:54:53.150 --> 04:54:53.160 align:start position:0%
demonstrates we do not mean
 
04:54:53.160 --> 04:54:54.830 align:start position:0%
demonstrates we do not mean
retrospective

04:54:54.830 --> 04:54:54.840 align:start position:0%
retrospective
 
04:54:57.948 --> 04:54:57.958 align:start position:0%
it's fine that we're not looking back at
 
04:55:00.050 --> 04:55:00.060 align:start position:0%
previous things it's from this point
 
04:55:02.448 --> 04:55:02.458 align:start position:0%
forward I see unanimity okay we'll do
 
04:55:04.128 --> 04:55:04.138 align:start position:0%
that then
 
04:55:06.230 --> 04:55:06.240 align:start position:0%
rear consideration on that point
 
04:55:08.930 --> 04:55:08.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:11.750 --> 04:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much and
 
04:55:19.550 --> 04:55:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:32.050 --> 04:55:32.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:34.788 --> 04:55:34.798 align:start position:0%
we can't hear you up here
 
04:55:36.530 --> 04:55:36.540 align:start position:0%
time would it be okay with returning
 
04:55:37.910 --> 04:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
Julie Kirkland came up with attorney
 
04:55:40.368 --> 04:55:40.378 align:start position:0%
names sure look I found out last Friday
 
04:55:42.288 --> 04:55:42.298 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of microphones so if you
 
04:55:44.448 --> 04:55:44.458 align:start position:0%
want to come up and find one that has
 
04:55:46.250 --> 04:55:46.260 align:start position:0%
little red buttons you can come up at
 
04:55:47.750 --> 04:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
this point you can come up too if you
 
04:55:47.760 --> 04:55:48.650 align:start position:0%
this point you can come up too if you
want

04:55:48.650 --> 04:55:48.660 align:start position:0%
want
 
04:55:51.288 --> 04:55:51.298 align:start position:0%
attorney Hayes if you feel like it you
 
04:55:54.050 --> 04:55:54.060 align:start position:0%
know okay go and I will let attorney
 
04:55:56.690 --> 04:55:56.700 align:start position:0%
Kirkland go first if I know you may do
 
04:55:58.550 --> 04:55:58.560 align:start position:0%
that provided quite a bit of testimony
 
04:56:01.190 --> 04:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
to the committee already all right well
 
04:56:03.830 --> 04:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you my name is
 
04:56:06.470 --> 04:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
Kimberly Kirkland I'm a lawyer at rice
 
04:56:08.810 --> 04:56:08.820 align:start position:0%
and Kirkland in Manchester I live here
 
04:56:12.110 --> 04:56:12.120 align:start position:0%
in Concord I was a faculty member at the
 
04:56:15.350 --> 04:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
UNH formerly Franklin Pierce Law Center
 
04:56:18.110 --> 04:56:18.120 align:start position:0%
School of Law for 15 years where I
 
04:56:21.770 --> 04:56:21.780 align:start position:0%
taught civil procedure and legal ethics
 
04:56:24.890 --> 04:56:24.900 align:start position:0%
and actually taught law students about
 
04:56:28.070 --> 04:56:28.080 align:start position:0%
the attorney discipline process and
 
04:56:29.868 --> 04:56:29.878 align:start position:0%
malpractice suits against attorneys and
 
04:56:32.390 --> 04:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
those kinds of things my firm now does
 
04:56:35.810 --> 04:56:35.820 align:start position:0%
plaintive smell practice work and I
 
04:56:37.850 --> 04:56:37.860 align:start position:0%
think given where the discussion has
 
04:56:41.690 --> 04:56:41.700 align:start position:0%
gone gone today I I would just
 
04:56:45.170 --> 04:56:45.180 align:start position:0%
um jump in and respectfully say I think
 
04:56:47.930 --> 04:56:47.940 align:start position:0%
that the changes you're talking about in
 
04:56:49.910 --> 04:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
this recommend station you're making
 
04:56:52.310 --> 04:56:52.320 align:start position:0%
would not have changed what happened
 
04:56:54.350 --> 04:56:54.360 align:start position:0%
with Dr Baraboo
 
04:56:57.470 --> 04:56:57.480 align:start position:0%
I don't see anything in that document
 
04:57:01.250 --> 04:57:01.260 align:start position:0%
that would change what happened as I
 
04:57:04.250 --> 04:57:04.260 align:start position:0%
understand it there were 21 lawsuits
 
04:57:07.550 --> 04:57:07.560 align:start position:0%
filed and perhaps more lawsuits were
 
04:57:10.670 --> 04:57:10.680 align:start position:0%
filed against Dr barabo and I'd say by
 
04:57:13.128 --> 04:57:13.138 align:start position:0%
the way Holly represented some
 
04:57:14.990 --> 04:57:15.000 align:start position:0%
plaintiffs in those cases I didn't have
 
04:57:17.150 --> 04:57:17.160 align:start position:0%
any of those cases so I'm not talking to
 
04:57:18.890 --> 04:57:18.900 align:start position:0%
you as an advocate
 
04:57:22.970 --> 04:57:22.980 align:start position:0%
for those particular patients but as I
 
04:57:25.910 --> 04:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
understand it there were claims made 21
 
04:57:29.030 --> 04:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
of them were settled the only reason we
 
04:57:32.208 --> 04:57:32.218 align:start position:0%
know that there were 21 claims that were
 
04:57:35.090 --> 04:57:35.100 align:start position:0%
strong enough to be settled is because
 
04:57:37.070 --> 04:57:37.080 align:start position:0%
they were reported in the National
 
04:57:39.770 --> 04:57:39.780 align:start position:0%
Practitioner Data Bank and Massachusetts
 
04:57:42.770 --> 04:57:42.780 align:start position:0%
made that information available to
 
04:57:42.780 --> 04:57:44.650 align:start position:0%
made that information available to
Massachusetts

04:57:44.650 --> 04:57:44.660 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
04:57:47.448 --> 04:57:47.458 align:start position:0%
patients consumer citizens but we don't
 
04:57:50.930 --> 04:57:50.940 align:start position:0%
know the specifics of those cases we
 
04:57:53.990 --> 04:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
don't but it could be anything but I
 
04:57:56.150 --> 04:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
really take issue with this idea
 
04:57:59.650 --> 04:57:59.660 align:start position:0%
presented that settled lawsuits
 
04:58:02.868 --> 04:58:02.878 align:start position:0%
represent frivolous claims I don't think
 
04:58:04.970 --> 04:58:04.980 align:start position:0%
anyone here said that we said that some
 
04:58:07.670 --> 04:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
of them do some of them are heroic
 
04:58:10.970 --> 04:58:10.980 align:start position:0%
actions where the patient died but still
 
04:58:14.208 --> 04:58:14.218 align:start position:0%
there was no guilt involved and some of
 
04:58:17.090 --> 04:58:17.100 align:start position:0%
them were we very carefully each session
 
04:58:19.850 --> 04:58:19.860 align:start position:0%
of this committee broke out those 3 in
 
04:58:22.010 --> 04:58:22.020 align:start position:0%
terms of malpractice and what I kept
 
04:58:23.810 --> 04:58:23.820 align:start position:0%
saying is from the Massachusetts website
 
04:58:25.910 --> 04:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
I can't tell which is which
 
04:58:27.890 --> 04:58:27.900 align:start position:0%
uh that's true
 
04:58:29.930 --> 04:58:29.940 align:start position:0%
um I would say that I think patients
 
04:58:32.390 --> 04:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
have a right to have that information
 
04:58:34.550 --> 04:58:34.560 align:start position:0%
when they're making decisions about who
 
04:58:37.190 --> 04:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
their doctor should be but if you assume
 
04:58:40.310 --> 04:58:40.320 align:start position:0%
that out of those 21 lawsuits at least
 
04:58:44.690 --> 04:58:44.700 align:start position:0%
some of them had Merit how is it that
 
04:58:48.230 --> 04:58:48.240 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Board of Medicine did
 
04:58:51.590 --> 04:58:51.600 align:start position:0%
not find its way to discipline Dr barabo
 
04:58:55.670 --> 04:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
in any but one of those cases there's
 
04:58:58.010 --> 04:58:58.020 align:start position:0%
something happening there's a problem at
 
04:59:00.230 --> 04:59:00.240 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Board of Medicine in
 
04:59:02.810 --> 04:59:02.820 align:start position:0%
terms of the efficacy of their
 
04:59:06.070 --> 04:59:06.080 align:start position:0%
investigations and it may be a result of
 
04:59:09.170 --> 04:59:09.180 align:start position:0%
problems in terms of personnel and
 
04:59:12.470 --> 04:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
funding and process but I can tell you
 
04:59:16.670 --> 04:59:16.680 align:start position:0%
in the claims that I bring we used to
 
04:59:19.368 --> 04:59:19.378 align:start position:0%
see requests from the Board of Medicine
 
04:59:22.310 --> 04:59:22.320 align:start position:0%
when I filed a lawsuit in Superior Court
 
04:59:25.070 --> 04:59:25.080 align:start position:0%
and the Superior Court then transferred
 
04:59:28.128 --> 04:59:28.138 align:start position:0%
that complaint the Board of Medicine we
 
04:59:29.990 --> 04:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
would get a communication from the Board
 
04:59:32.270 --> 04:59:32.280 align:start position:0%
of Medicine asking us to have our
 
04:59:34.990 --> 04:59:35.000 align:start position:0%
clients sign a medical authorization
 
04:59:37.730 --> 04:59:37.740 align:start position:0%
consistent with HIPAA that would allow
 
04:59:40.128 --> 04:59:40.138 align:start position:0%
the board to collect their medical
 
04:59:42.948 --> 04:59:42.958 align:start position:0%
records let me interrupt on this before
 
04:59:46.610 --> 04:59:46.620 align:start position:0%
you go past this point of the 20 that
 
04:59:48.890 --> 04:59:48.900 align:start position:0%
the Massachusetts board reported then
 
04:59:51.770 --> 04:59:51.780 align:start position:0%
there's one more apparently and there
 
04:59:56.030 --> 04:59:56.040 align:start position:0%
seemed to be some discipline at CMC
 
05:00:01.610 --> 05:00:01.620 align:start position:0%
wouldn't the next complaint go to oplc
 
05:00:04.310 --> 05:00:04.320 align:start position:0%
well I then would investigate it and
 
05:00:06.410 --> 05:00:06.420 align:start position:0%
kick it to Board of Medicine but as I
 
05:00:06.420 --> 05:00:07.910 align:start position:0%
kick it to Board of Medicine but as I
understand

05:00:07.910 --> 05:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
understand
 
05:00:07.920 --> 05:00:09.128 align:start position:0%
understand
well

05:00:09.128 --> 05:00:09.138 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:00:12.948 --> 05:00:12.958 align:start position:0%
CMC didn't report well let me share it
 
05:00:19.730 --> 05:00:19.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:21.170 --> 05:00:21.180 align:start position:0%
I think they're talking about a specific
 
05:00:24.110 --> 05:00:24.120 align:start position:0%
case he wasn't in existence during
 
05:00:26.690 --> 05:00:26.700 align:start position:0%
several of those matters
 
05:00:28.910 --> 05:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
um so I just wanted to clarify that
 
05:00:35.390 --> 05:00:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:37.430 --> 05:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
for chair right
 
05:00:39.350 --> 05:00:39.360 align:start position:0%
I'm getting a little uncomfortable I I
 
05:00:41.690 --> 05:00:41.700 align:start position:0%
don't believe we should be using a
 
05:00:43.850 --> 05:00:43.860 align:start position:0%
specific individual's name we're here to
 
05:00:46.730 --> 05:00:46.740 align:start position:0%
look at process uh we're not
 
05:00:48.590 --> 05:00:48.600 align:start position:0%
um but it's I don't believe it's
 
05:00:51.770 --> 05:00:51.780 align:start position:0%
appropriate for us to uh continue any
 
05:00:54.470 --> 05:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
further Dialogue on an individual
 
05:00:57.288 --> 05:00:57.298 align:start position:0%
scenario other than the fact that we can
 
05:01:00.110 --> 05:01:00.120 align:start position:0%
generically refer to some procedural or
 
05:01:02.868 --> 05:01:02.878 align:start position:0%
process questions that may arise but I
 
05:01:05.810 --> 05:01:05.820 align:start position:0%
if we could avoid using names the chair
 
05:01:08.330 --> 05:01:08.340 align:start position:0%
appreciates that thank you very much we
 
05:01:11.448 --> 05:01:11.458 align:start position:0%
can as we've been trying to do say it
 
05:01:13.310 --> 05:01:13.320 align:start position:0%
seems there have been certain things
 
05:01:15.590 --> 05:01:15.600 align:start position:0%
that might have risen to the level of
 
05:01:17.868 --> 05:01:17.878 align:start position:0%
but where did they wind up ever being
 
05:01:19.550 --> 05:01:19.560 align:start position:0%
dealt with that's what we're trying to
 
05:01:22.310 --> 05:01:22.320 align:start position:0%
figure out we're not adjudicating any
 
05:01:25.128 --> 05:01:25.138 align:start position:0%
specific things against an individual
 
05:01:27.410 --> 05:01:27.420 align:start position:0%
we're trying to see if a process needs
 
05:01:29.330 --> 05:01:29.340 align:start position:0%
to be tweaked or and I wasn't trying to
 
05:01:32.090 --> 05:01:32.100 align:start position:0%
suggest adjudicating anything against
 
05:01:34.550 --> 05:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
any individual but I appreciate it we
 
05:01:37.368 --> 05:01:37.378 align:start position:0%
have examples of
 
05:01:40.610 --> 05:01:40.620 align:start position:0%
situations where Hospital credentialing
 
05:01:43.628 --> 05:01:43.638 align:start position:0%
committees did not make reports our
 
05:01:46.850 --> 05:01:46.860 align:start position:0%
Challenge on the naming of people is
 
05:01:49.788 --> 05:01:49.798 align:start position:0%
that we have the Press here and I don't
 
05:01:53.030 --> 05:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
think it's appropriate to reintroduce a
 
05:01:56.390 --> 05:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
physician's name again into a media
 
05:01:58.970 --> 05:01:58.980 align:start position:0%
environment that's why I'm asking us to
 
05:02:01.430 --> 05:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
just you're doing it now but let's just
 
05:02:04.250 --> 05:02:04.260 align:start position:0%
stick to the process questions all right
 
05:02:06.350 --> 05:02:06.360 align:start position:0%
my process question is your
 
05:02:09.170 --> 05:02:09.180 align:start position:0%
recommendation suggests that you are
 
05:02:13.128 --> 05:02:13.138 align:start position:0%
going to rely heavily on reporting by
 
05:02:16.610 --> 05:02:16.620 align:start position:0%
Hospital credentialing committees as a
 
05:02:20.208 --> 05:02:20.218 align:start position:0%
way of triggering information to the
 
05:02:22.010 --> 05:02:22.020 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine and the Board of
 
05:02:23.510 --> 05:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
Medicine then following up with
 
05:02:27.530 --> 05:02:27.540 align:start position:0%
investigations and I'm not clear that
 
05:02:27.540 --> 05:02:28.690 align:start position:0%
investigations and I'm not clear that
even

05:02:28.690 --> 05:02:28.700 align:start position:0%
even
 
05:02:34.868 --> 05:02:34.878 align:start position:0%
now that hospitals who do have a
 
05:02:38.270 --> 05:02:38.280 align:start position:0%
requirement that they mandatorily report
 
05:02:40.368 --> 05:02:40.378 align:start position:0%
discipline if they've formally
 
05:02:42.530 --> 05:02:42.540 align:start position:0%
disciplined a physician as I understand
 
05:02:44.270 --> 05:02:44.280 align:start position:0%
it they're required to report to the
 
05:02:45.590 --> 05:02:45.600 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine okay there's a period
 
05:02:47.170 --> 05:02:47.180 align:start position:0%
in there go ahead
 
05:02:49.430 --> 05:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
for Kirkland
 
05:02:50.530 --> 05:02:50.540 align:start position:0%
um welcome
 
05:02:53.690 --> 05:02:53.700 align:start position:0%
you will note within this document being
 
05:02:55.310 --> 05:02:55.320 align:start position:0%
an attorney I'm sure you've read it
 
05:02:58.970 --> 05:02:58.980 align:start position:0%
carefully that there is provision for
 
05:03:01.730 --> 05:03:01.740 align:start position:0%
complaints to be heard and for
 
05:03:05.030 --> 05:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
responsible reporting by chief medical
 
05:03:05.040 --> 05:03:06.550 align:start position:0%
responsible reporting by chief medical
officers

05:03:06.550 --> 05:03:06.560 align:start position:0%
officers
 
05:03:09.310 --> 05:03:09.320 align:start position:0%
presidents of medical staff
 
05:03:14.208 --> 05:03:14.218 align:start position:0%
a physician colleagues that's all built
 
05:03:14.218 --> 05:03:15.050 align:start position:0%
a physician colleagues that's all built
in

05:03:15.050 --> 05:03:15.060 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:03:15.060 --> 05:03:16.750 align:start position:0%
in
so

05:03:16.750 --> 05:03:16.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:03:21.230 --> 05:03:21.240 align:start position:0%
not only do complaints go under this
 
05:03:23.930 --> 05:03:23.940 align:start position:0%
document to the Board of Medicine from
 
05:03:27.788 --> 05:03:27.798 align:start position:0%
hospitals but also from Physicians staff
 
05:03:33.650 --> 05:03:33.660 align:start position:0%
and uh the regulating staff the medical
 
05:03:36.250 --> 05:03:36.260 align:start position:0%
staff at the hospital
 
05:03:40.128 --> 05:03:40.138 align:start position:0%
those are all already built in and I
 
05:03:42.410 --> 05:03:42.420 align:start position:0%
think you would probably find in reading
 
05:03:45.170 --> 05:03:45.180 align:start position:0%
this document that it's not just the
 
05:03:47.570 --> 05:03:47.580 align:start position:0%
hospital's responsibility it's the
 
05:03:50.150 --> 05:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
professional's responsibility and we've
 
05:03:54.368 --> 05:03:54.378 align:start position:0%
covered that and is there some
 
05:03:58.390 --> 05:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
teeth to that in terms of getting
 
05:04:01.490 --> 05:04:01.500 align:start position:0%
a chief of a medical staff or a
 
05:04:03.530 --> 05:04:03.540 align:start position:0%
physician colleague to report a
 
05:04:05.868 --> 05:04:05.878 align:start position:0%
colleague to the Board of Medicine as
 
05:04:08.208 --> 05:04:08.218 align:start position:0%
you know you're Adept at this this is
 
05:04:12.050 --> 05:04:12.060 align:start position:0%
not yet even an LSR let alone a statute
 
05:04:16.490 --> 05:04:16.500 align:start position:0%
and that remains to be drafted of course
 
05:04:21.230 --> 05:04:21.240 align:start position:0%
however the verbiage is those Physicians
 
05:04:25.490 --> 05:04:25.500 align:start position:0%
shall report not should not May it's
 
05:04:29.990 --> 05:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
shall and it remains for the very Adept
 
05:04:33.230 --> 05:04:33.240 align:start position:0%
legislators on the oversight committee
 
05:04:36.050 --> 05:04:36.060 align:start position:0%
and in the House and Senate to draft
 
05:04:38.868 --> 05:04:38.878 align:start position:0%
legislation that contains appropriate
 
05:04:41.150 --> 05:04:41.160 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action if those reports are
 
05:04:43.910 --> 05:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
not leveled thank you
 
05:04:46.670 --> 05:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
um all right well assuming if you assume
 
05:04:49.368 --> 05:04:49.378 align:start position:0%
that reports are going to be coming from
 
05:04:51.730 --> 05:04:51.740 align:start position:0%
those folks that you've just identified
 
05:04:54.830 --> 05:04:54.840 align:start position:0%
the Board of Medicine has to be equipped
 
05:04:58.128 --> 05:04:58.138 align:start position:0%
to do adequate investigations and we are
 
05:04:59.708 --> 05:04:59.718 align:start position:0%
not seeing
 
05:05:02.090 --> 05:05:02.100 align:start position:0%
investigatory work we're not seeing
 
05:05:04.128 --> 05:05:04.138 align:start position:0%
requests for authorizations for medical
 
05:05:06.770 --> 05:05:06.780 align:start position:0%
records coming anymore from the Board of
 
05:05:08.868 --> 05:05:08.878 align:start position:0%
Medicine this is why one of the last
 
05:05:11.208 --> 05:05:11.218 align:start position:0%
paragraphs talks about adequate funding
 
05:05:14.448 --> 05:05:14.458 align:start position:0%
when bom was here they said that they
 
05:05:17.090 --> 05:05:17.100 align:start position:0%
they do the best they can but they're
 
05:05:20.390 --> 05:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
just not staffed sufficiently so we
 
05:05:22.850 --> 05:05:22.860 align:start position:0%
intend to deal with that problem so it
 
05:05:25.250 --> 05:05:25.260 align:start position:0%
would could not be in the future cited
 
05:05:28.850 --> 05:05:28.860 align:start position:0%
as a reason for a lack and and I think
 
05:05:33.170 --> 05:05:33.180 align:start position:0%
we would argue that it would behoove the
 
05:05:36.910 --> 05:05:36.920 align:start position:0%
process to consider having professional
 
05:05:39.670 --> 05:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
investigators both physician and lawyer
 
05:05:42.490 --> 05:05:42.500 align:start position:0%
investigators as was suggested earlier
 
05:05:45.770 --> 05:05:45.780 align:start position:0%
who could fulfill that function
 
05:05:47.868 --> 05:05:47.878 align:start position:0%
okay last Point yes please go ahead
 
05:05:50.990 --> 05:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Sharon and thank you
 
05:05:52.730 --> 05:05:52.740 align:start position:0%
representative saloway for all of your
 
05:05:54.530 --> 05:05:54.540 align:start position:0%
work on this document and the entire
 
05:05:58.490 --> 05:05:58.500 align:start position:0%
committee it's an excellent First Step
 
05:05:58.500 --> 05:05:59.690 align:start position:0%
committee it's an excellent First Step
um

05:05:59.690 --> 05:05:59.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:05:59.700 --> 05:06:01.850 align:start position:0%
um
respectfully

05:06:01.850 --> 05:06:01.860 align:start position:0%
respectfully
 
05:06:04.490 --> 05:06:04.500 align:start position:0%
my difficulty with this document is that
 
05:06:07.490 --> 05:06:07.500 align:start position:0%
it essentially codifies existing law
 
05:06:11.208 --> 05:06:11.218 align:start position:0%
there are only two changes that I can
 
05:06:13.128 --> 05:06:13.138 align:start position:0%
see and one would be if
 
05:06:14.990 --> 05:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
physician Hospital discipline is
 
05:06:17.628 --> 05:06:17.638 align:start position:0%
reported on the website and two would be
 
05:06:19.730 --> 05:06:19.740 align:start position:0%
if malpractice cases were reported on
 
05:06:20.750 --> 05:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
the website
 
05:06:23.810 --> 05:06:23.820 align:start position:0%
but how the document is drafted right
 
05:06:23.820 --> 05:06:25.070 align:start position:0%
but how the document is drafted right
now

05:06:25.070 --> 05:06:25.080 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:06:27.170 --> 05:06:27.180 align:start position:0%
um it says judicial findings of
 
05:06:29.208 --> 05:06:29.218 align:start position:0%
malpractice or a malpractice finding in
 
05:06:31.610 --> 05:06:31.620 align:start position:0%
favor of a plaintiff
 
05:06:35.410 --> 05:06:35.420 align:start position:0%
99 of malpractice cases
 
05:06:37.670 --> 05:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
resolve outside of court so there's not
 
05:06:39.288 --> 05:06:39.298 align:start position:0%
a Judicial finding of malpractice
 
05:06:41.208 --> 05:06:41.218 align:start position:0%
there's not a finding in favor of
 
05:06:43.610 --> 05:06:43.620 align:start position:0%
plaintiff medical malpractice cases are
 
05:06:45.530 --> 05:06:45.540 align:start position:0%
you that resolve out of court usually
 
05:06:47.448 --> 05:06:47.458 align:start position:0%
have neither party docket markings
 
05:06:49.730 --> 05:06:49.740 align:start position:0%
saying that neither party won so that's
 
05:06:52.610 --> 05:06:52.620 align:start position:0%
how the majority of them pay out and I
 
05:06:54.650 --> 05:06:54.660 align:start position:0%
just respectfully wonder if
 
05:06:57.350 --> 05:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
what you may have intended for that
 
05:06:59.448 --> 05:06:59.458 align:start position:0%
provision is the payments by the
 
05:07:01.250 --> 05:07:01.260 align:start position:0%
National Practitioner Data Bank that
 
05:07:02.690 --> 05:07:02.700 align:start position:0%
we've been discussing that Massachusetts
 
05:07:05.448 --> 05:07:05.458 align:start position:0%
reports as opposed to the malpractice
 
05:07:07.788 --> 05:07:07.798 align:start position:0%
claims itself when there is a payment on
 
05:07:09.650 --> 05:07:09.660 align:start position:0%
behalf of a physician
 
05:07:12.288 --> 05:07:12.298 align:start position:0%
with regard to the existing law though
 
05:07:14.890 --> 05:07:14.900 align:start position:0%
respectfully the this committee was
 
05:07:17.448 --> 05:07:17.458 align:start position:0%
formed to
 
05:07:22.030 --> 05:07:22.040 align:start position:0%
in response to a specific issue and
 
05:07:24.590 --> 05:07:24.600 align:start position:0%
that was the trigger we have become
 
05:07:26.090 --> 05:07:26.100 align:start position:0%
aware there could have been other
 
05:07:28.910 --> 05:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
triggers this one happened to be the one
 
05:07:30.470 --> 05:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
that did it but it could have been
 
05:07:33.110 --> 05:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
otherwise yes thank you very much
 
05:07:35.930 --> 05:07:35.940 align:start position:0%
um and respectfully with all of the
 
05:07:37.610 --> 05:07:37.620 align:start position:0%
reporting mechanisms that are already in
 
05:07:39.470 --> 05:07:39.480 align:start position:0%
place our concern is that this isn't
 
05:07:40.730 --> 05:07:40.740 align:start position:0%
going to change anything because there
 
05:07:43.070 --> 05:07:43.080 align:start position:0%
are no teeth the previously there were
 
05:07:44.810 --> 05:07:44.820 align:start position:0%
mandatory reporting mechanisms by
 
05:07:47.110 --> 05:07:47.120 align:start position:0%
Statute or hospitals of all discipline
 
05:07:49.250 --> 05:07:49.260 align:start position:0%
disciplinary conduct that is in the
 
05:07:52.670 --> 05:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
statute RSA 151 by courts by insurance
 
05:07:52.680 --> 05:07:54.050 align:start position:0%
statute RSA 151 by courts by insurance
companies

05:07:54.050 --> 05:07:54.060 align:start position:0%
companies
 
05:07:56.448 --> 05:07:56.458 align:start position:0%
um respectfully if all of this had
 
05:08:00.288 --> 05:08:00.298 align:start position:0%
happened in the past we know based on
 
05:08:02.830 --> 05:08:02.840 align:start position:0%
what was published there were at least
 
05:08:06.350 --> 05:08:06.360 align:start position:0%
five public lawsuits against one
 
05:08:09.350 --> 05:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
position we know that there was a
 
05:08:11.150 --> 05:08:11.160 align:start position:0%
hospital report of discipline against
 
05:08:14.570 --> 05:08:14.580 align:start position:0%
the same physician we know that at least
 
05:08:16.910 --> 05:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
one New Hampshire attorney drafted a
 
05:08:19.550 --> 05:08:19.560 align:start position:0%
letter to the Board of Medicine about
 
05:08:21.770 --> 05:08:21.780 align:start position:0%
the same physician
 
05:08:24.230 --> 05:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
at the point if the National
 
05:08:25.970 --> 05:08:25.980 align:start position:0%
Practitioner Data Bank is reporting
 
05:08:28.128 --> 05:08:28.138 align:start position:0%
payments at the same time they would
 
05:08:31.070 --> 05:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
have reported before 2017 at least five
 
05:08:33.948 --> 05:08:33.958 align:start position:0%
payments and in 2020 and 2021 they would
 
05:08:38.810 --> 05:08:38.820 align:start position:0%
have reported the additional 17 payments
 
05:08:38.820 --> 05:08:40.070 align:start position:0%
have reported the additional 17 payments
um

05:08:40.070 --> 05:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:41.690 --> 05:08:41.700 align:start position:0%
insurance companies at the same time
 
05:08:42.890 --> 05:08:42.900 align:start position:0%
should have been reporting their
 
05:08:44.868 --> 05:08:44.878 align:start position:0%
reserves if you look on the Board of
 
05:08:46.310 --> 05:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
Medicine website and this is one
 
05:08:48.708 --> 05:08:48.718 align:start position:0%
question you were looking at there are
 
05:08:50.208 --> 05:08:50.218 align:start position:0%
guidelines published for Hospital
 
05:08:52.010 --> 05:08:52.020 align:start position:0%
reporting that's already on that website
 
05:08:53.810 --> 05:08:53.820 align:start position:0%
there's a specific document for
 
05:08:56.628 --> 05:08:56.638 align:start position:0%
guidelines for reporting there's also a
 
05:08:58.250 --> 05:08:58.260 align:start position:0%
specific document
 
05:08:58.260 --> 05:08:59.288 align:start position:0%
specific document
um

05:08:59.288 --> 05:08:59.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:09:01.970 --> 05:09:01.980 align:start position:0%
toward directed to insurance companies
 
05:09:03.890 --> 05:09:03.900 align:start position:0%
because they are not reporting as
 
05:09:04.970 --> 05:09:04.980 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to they are not
 
05:09:07.128 --> 05:09:07.138 align:start position:0%
complying with the statute and they
 
05:09:10.090 --> 05:09:10.100 align:start position:0%
aren't reporting reservable claims so
 
05:09:12.110 --> 05:09:12.120 align:start position:0%
respectfully I
 
05:09:14.510 --> 05:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
think that had
 
05:09:16.310 --> 05:09:16.320 align:start position:0%
all of the reporting requirements been
 
05:09:17.990 --> 05:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
followed had the board been doing its
 
05:09:21.050 --> 05:09:21.060 align:start position:0%
job when all of these reports were made
 
05:09:23.150 --> 05:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
we would never have gotten to this point
 
05:09:25.490 --> 05:09:25.500 align:start position:0%
because by the time the hospital was
 
05:09:28.910 --> 05:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
taking discipline in 2013
 
05:09:31.128 --> 05:09:31.138 align:start position:0%
it should have been acted on by the
 
05:09:33.470 --> 05:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine the chair wonders
 
05:09:33.480 --> 05:09:36.170 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine the chair wonders
allowed

05:09:36.170 --> 05:09:36.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:39.050 --> 05:09:39.060 align:start position:0%
um if perhaps some of these things is
 
05:09:41.690 --> 05:09:41.700 align:start position:0%
not the scope of the Attorney General's
 
05:09:45.230 --> 05:09:45.240 align:start position:0%
office's investigation that's ongoing at
 
05:09:46.730 --> 05:09:46.740 align:start position:0%
present time
 
05:09:48.830 --> 05:09:48.840 align:start position:0%
and I'm unfamiliar with that
 
05:09:50.208 --> 05:09:50.218 align:start position:0%
investigation I learned about that today
 
05:09:52.368 --> 05:09:52.378 align:start position:0%
for the first time which I was very
 
05:09:56.208 --> 05:09:56.218 align:start position:0%
pleased to hear that it is ongoing it is
 
05:09:59.410 --> 05:09:59.420 align:start position:0%
representative soloway
 
05:10:02.270 --> 05:10:02.280 align:start position:0%
councilor hey it's nice to see you again
 
05:10:04.010 --> 05:10:04.020 align:start position:0%
um I have a legal question to which I
 
05:10:05.390 --> 05:10:05.400 align:start position:0%
don't have any answer but I suspect you
 
05:10:08.868 --> 05:10:08.878 align:start position:0%
do what kinds of limitations are imposed
 
05:10:11.510 --> 05:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
on publication by non-disclosure
 
05:10:14.448 --> 05:10:14.458 align:start position:0%
agreements and how do we get ourselves
 
05:10:18.050 --> 05:10:18.060 align:start position:0%
past that that as as drafted this
 
05:10:21.470 --> 05:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
document that was a real conundrum for
 
05:10:23.690 --> 05:10:23.700 align:start position:0%
this non-non attorney
 
05:10:26.510 --> 05:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
so the the non-disclosure agreements I
 
05:10:28.070 --> 05:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
presume that you mean
 
05:10:29.628 --> 05:10:29.638 align:start position:0%
if that you're cutting published
 
05:10:30.890 --> 05:10:30.900 align:start position:0%
settlements if there's an insurance
 
05:10:32.810 --> 05:10:32.820 align:start position:0%
element and there's a non-disclosure
 
05:10:32.820 --> 05:10:33.948 align:start position:0%
element and there's a non-disclosure
agreement

05:10:33.948 --> 05:10:33.958 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
05:10:36.708 --> 05:10:36.718 align:start position:0%
how do we get around that if we want to
 
05:10:40.190 --> 05:10:40.200 align:start position:0%
make that public and so I don't think
 
05:10:42.170 --> 05:10:42.180 align:start position:0%
that you can you can publish that a
 
05:10:44.270 --> 05:10:44.280 align:start position:0%
lawsuit was filed in court we've heard
 
05:10:45.770 --> 05:10:45.780 align:start position:0%
the difficulties with that or the issues
 
05:10:47.930 --> 05:10:47.940 align:start position:0%
that might arise but you could also
 
05:10:49.310 --> 05:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
publish the information that
 
05:10:51.470 --> 05:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts publishes just the fact
 
05:10:54.110 --> 05:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
that a payment was made and the date
 
05:10:56.030 --> 05:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
that the payment was made and the
 
05:10:58.190 --> 05:10:58.200 align:start position:0%
position there are no facts about the
 
05:11:00.288 --> 05:11:00.298 align:start position:0%
malpractice that are included even if
 
05:11:01.970 --> 05:11:01.980 align:start position:0%
these are non-disclosure agreement you
 
05:11:03.490 --> 05:11:03.500 align:start position:0%
get the option to payment was made
 
05:11:06.170 --> 05:11:06.180 align:start position:0%
that's all information that's contained
 
05:11:07.730 --> 05:11:07.740 align:start position:0%
within the National Practitioner Data
 
05:11:09.110 --> 05:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
Bank that's reported to the Board of
 
05:11:10.910 --> 05:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
Medicine already within 30 days of when
 
05:11:13.190 --> 05:11:13.200 align:start position:0%
it's reported every insurance company is
 
05:11:15.890 --> 05:11:15.900 align:start position:0%
required to report to the National
 
05:11:17.628 --> 05:11:17.638 align:start position:0%
Practitioner Data Bank if they make a
 
05:11:19.970 --> 05:11:19.980 align:start position:0%
payment on behalf of a physician and
 
05:11:22.128 --> 05:11:22.138 align:start position:0%
they reported the National Practitioner
 
05:11:23.868 --> 05:11:23.878 align:start position:0%
Data Bank then reports it to the Board
 
05:11:25.970 --> 05:11:25.980 align:start position:0%
of Medicine a quick follow-up quick
 
05:11:28.690 --> 05:11:28.700 align:start position:0%
follow-up can you imagine the reluctance
 
05:11:31.368 --> 05:11:31.378 align:start position:0%
of non-attorneys On The Board of
 
05:11:35.750 --> 05:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
Medicine to publicize if there is a
 
05:11:37.430 --> 05:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
non-disclosure agreement not really
 
05:11:39.970 --> 05:11:39.980 align:start position:0%
knowing what the legal Turf is
 
05:11:42.368 --> 05:11:42.378 align:start position:0%
I can't understand that but
 
05:11:45.490 --> 05:11:45.500 align:start position:0%
non-disclosure agreements are generally
 
05:11:47.930 --> 05:11:47.940 align:start position:0%
limited to the specific case they're
 
05:11:47.940 --> 05:11:49.250 align:start position:0%
limited to the specific case they're
usually

05:11:49.250 --> 05:11:49.260 align:start position:0%
usually
 
05:11:52.250 --> 05:11:52.260 align:start position:0%
very artfully crafted stating that you
 
05:11:54.770 --> 05:11:54.780 align:start position:0%
can't disclose the names of the parties
 
05:11:57.530 --> 05:11:57.540 align:start position:0%
the doctor the hospital the conduct
 
05:12:00.948 --> 05:12:00.958 align:start position:0%
specifically the court or the settlement
 
05:12:04.010 --> 05:12:04.020 align:start position:0%
terms those are the usually the parts of
 
05:12:06.230 --> 05:12:06.240 align:start position:0%
the non-disclosure agreement there's
 
05:12:09.128 --> 05:12:09.138 align:start position:0%
nothing that says
 
05:12:12.230 --> 05:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
that you can publish what is already a
 
05:12:14.868 --> 05:12:14.878 align:start position:0%
public document in Superior Court the
 
05:12:18.050 --> 05:12:18.060 align:start position:0%
fact that a case was filed or what is
 
05:12:19.788 --> 05:12:19.798 align:start position:0%
contained in the National Practitioner
 
05:12:21.708 --> 05:12:21.718 align:start position:0%
Data Bank the fact that a payment was
 
05:12:23.750 --> 05:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
made on behalf of the physician none of
 
05:12:26.150 --> 05:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
that would violate a non-disclosure
 
05:12:28.970 --> 05:12:28.980 align:start position:0%
agreement the other issues would this is
 
05:12:30.948 --> 05:12:30.958 align:start position:0%
where I repeat my statement that the
 
05:12:32.930 --> 05:12:32.940 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts board's reporting was
 
05:12:34.910 --> 05:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
either too much information or not
 
05:12:38.150 --> 05:12:38.160 align:start position:0%
enough information because all I see is
 
05:12:39.470 --> 05:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
settlement settlement settlement
 
05:12:41.930 --> 05:12:41.940 align:start position:0%
settlement I do not know how many were
 
05:12:46.368 --> 05:12:46.378 align:start position:0%
frivolous how many were heroic but not
 
05:12:48.650 --> 05:12:48.660 align:start position:0%
bad medicine the patient died because
 
05:12:50.448 --> 05:12:50.458 align:start position:0%
most of them were going to die anyway
 
05:12:53.090 --> 05:12:53.100 align:start position:0%
somebody stepped up and went in Where
 
05:12:55.670 --> 05:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
Angels Fear to operate and then how many
 
05:12:59.810 --> 05:12:59.820 align:start position:0%
of them were bad I can't tell so then
 
05:13:01.730 --> 05:13:01.740 align:start position:0%
don't tell me what you told me because
 
05:13:05.330 --> 05:13:05.340 align:start position:0%
you've told me half a story so that
 
05:13:08.390 --> 05:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
comes back to if there is a
 
05:13:10.910 --> 05:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
settlement where there is also
 
05:13:13.310 --> 05:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action we need to know
 
05:13:15.230 --> 05:13:15.240 align:start position:0%
about that and I would say nothing less
 
05:13:16.910 --> 05:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
than that but nothing more that's what
 
05:13:18.110 --> 05:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
we're trying to get
 
05:13:18.120 --> 05:13:19.730 align:start position:0%
we're trying to get
okay

05:13:19.730 --> 05:13:19.740 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:13:22.730 --> 05:13:22.740 align:start position:0%
um I got two minutes to wrap it up thank
 
05:13:23.990 --> 05:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
05:13:25.850 --> 05:13:25.860 align:start position:0%
um it does not include you're asking the
 
05:13:27.970 --> 05:13:27.980 align:start position:0%
question so would you ask your question
 
05:13:32.030 --> 05:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
you know I I I I was almost an attorney
 
05:13:35.030 --> 05:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
so I I appreciate that you guys are so
 
05:13:37.010 --> 05:13:37.020 align:start position:0%
comfortable in what feels like an
 
05:13:39.708 --> 05:13:39.718 align:start position:0%
adversarial situation here and I I'm
 
05:13:41.270 --> 05:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
going to try to just ask you some
 
05:13:43.430 --> 05:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
process questions I'm just a geek trying
 
05:13:45.890 --> 05:13:45.900 align:start position:0%
to build a machine okay
 
05:13:49.270 --> 05:13:49.280 align:start position:0%
um so I got four questions uh
 
05:13:53.150 --> 05:13:53.160 align:start position:0%
if when when a person files a
 
05:13:54.890 --> 05:13:54.900 align:start position:0%
malpractice case
 
05:13:58.850 --> 05:13:58.860 align:start position:0%
uh and that judicial decision comes over
 
05:14:01.850 --> 05:14:01.860 align:start position:0%
to the board of medicine do you believe
 
05:14:04.010 --> 05:14:04.020 align:start position:0%
that there's enough identifiable
 
05:14:06.530 --> 05:14:06.540 align:start position:0%
information of who the complaintance was
 
05:14:09.110 --> 05:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
that we could possibly use that
 
05:14:11.628 --> 05:14:11.638 align:start position:0%
information on the suit in order to
 
05:14:14.090 --> 05:14:14.100 align:start position:0%
contact them to let them know what the
 
05:14:16.788 --> 05:14:16.798 align:start position:0%
resolution of the case was absolutely
 
05:14:19.310 --> 05:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
the complaint that's filed with the
 
05:14:21.110 --> 05:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
court in order to establish jurisdiction
 
05:14:23.090 --> 05:14:23.100 align:start position:0%
the parties there and their address
 
05:14:25.850 --> 05:14:25.860 align:start position:0%
their residential address have to be
 
05:14:28.010 --> 05:14:28.020 align:start position:0%
published in that document okay so the
 
05:14:29.628 --> 05:14:29.638 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine would not have a
 
05:14:31.490 --> 05:14:31.500 align:start position:0%
problem figuring out who the actual
 
05:14:33.650 --> 05:14:33.660 align:start position:0%
human was that filed the complaint not
 
05:14:35.208 --> 05:14:35.218 align:start position:0%
at all it would be on page one or page
 
05:14:38.030 --> 05:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
two of the complaint second question
 
05:14:38.040 --> 05:14:39.288 align:start position:0%
two of the complaint second question
um

05:14:39.288 --> 05:14:39.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:42.610 --> 05:14:42.620 align:start position:0%
I'm confused now because it sounds like
 
05:14:46.788 --> 05:14:46.798 align:start position:0%
we we believe that in the statute that
 
05:14:50.208 --> 05:14:50.218 align:start position:0%
there's mandatory reporting of you know
 
05:14:52.850 --> 05:14:52.860 align:start position:0%
disciplinary actions by the hospitals
 
05:14:54.650 --> 05:14:54.660 align:start position:0%
and the like
 
05:14:57.890 --> 05:14:57.900 align:start position:0%
um but I'm hearing something contrary or
 
05:15:01.910 --> 05:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
it sounds like you're implying that they
 
05:15:04.430 --> 05:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
don't have to report because there's no
 
05:15:07.070 --> 05:15:07.080 align:start position:0%
teeth in this system and so this is
 
05:15:08.810 --> 05:15:08.820 align:start position:0%
surprising to me I would think that they
 
05:15:12.948 --> 05:15:12.958 align:start position:0%
would be mandate mandatory reporters
 
05:15:14.330 --> 05:15:14.340 align:start position:0%
um I can tell you that there is
 
05:15:16.190 --> 05:15:16.200 align:start position:0%
mandatory reporting required by the
 
05:15:18.650 --> 05:15:18.660 align:start position:0%
statute but I suspect it's how the
 
05:15:21.050 --> 05:15:21.060 align:start position:0%
internal committees are created that
 
05:15:24.350 --> 05:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
they can couch any review in the terms
 
05:15:27.050 --> 05:15:27.060 align:start position:0%
of credentialing or quality assurance or
 
05:15:29.208 --> 05:15:29.218 align:start position:0%
privilege of some sort I know that there
 
05:15:30.650 --> 05:15:30.660 align:start position:0%
are physicians in the room who are
 
05:15:32.330 --> 05:15:32.340 align:start position:0%
waiting to testify who may be able to
 
05:15:36.110 --> 05:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
speak more to that um okay the the
 
05:15:38.448 --> 05:15:38.458 align:start position:0%
comment I'm hearing from you that I'm
 
05:15:41.208 --> 05:15:41.218 align:start position:0%
trying to feed is
 
05:15:44.150 --> 05:15:44.160 align:start position:0%
um if if if there's no if there's not
 
05:15:47.270 --> 05:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
enough teeth in the statute I could use
 
05:15:50.090 --> 05:15:50.100 align:start position:0%
some specific specific language with
 
05:15:52.610 --> 05:15:52.620 align:start position:0%
your finger in the statute saying this
 
05:15:55.670 --> 05:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
is weak It should read this way I I the
 
05:15:57.350 --> 05:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
board is already or the committee's
 
05:15:59.150 --> 05:15:59.160 align:start position:0%
probably ready to do its final report
 
05:16:00.708 --> 05:16:00.718 align:start position:0%
but I would like to know that
 
05:16:03.650 --> 05:16:03.660 align:start position:0%
information the the
 
05:16:05.628 --> 05:16:05.638 align:start position:0%
um if you if you want to share that as
 
05:16:07.430 --> 05:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
you're invited to
 
05:16:10.448 --> 05:16:10.458 align:start position:0%
um you you I think one of you have
 
05:16:14.090 --> 05:16:14.100 align:start position:0%
implied that the Board of Medicine has
 
05:16:17.390 --> 05:16:17.400 align:start position:0%
some difficulty getting the records it
 
05:16:19.970 --> 05:16:19.980 align:start position:0%
would need in order for them to do an
 
05:16:22.610 --> 05:16:22.620 align:start position:0%
adequate investigation to make a
 
05:16:25.550 --> 05:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
determination of discipline or is there
 
05:16:27.830 --> 05:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
is there a problem with our statute
 
05:16:29.510 --> 05:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
where the Board of Medicine can't get
 
05:16:31.550 --> 05:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
the information they need to do a real
 
05:16:33.650 --> 05:16:33.660 align:start position:0%
investigation I I don't want to mishear
 
05:16:35.690 --> 05:16:35.700 align:start position:0%
you no I don't think that's the problem
 
05:16:37.850 --> 05:16:37.860 align:start position:0%
at all I believe what attorney Kirkland
 
05:16:40.250 --> 05:16:40.260 align:start position:0%
was referring to was years ago when
 
05:16:41.810 --> 05:16:41.820 align:start position:0%
there was an administrative prosecution
 
05:16:43.850 --> 05:16:43.860 align:start position:0%
unit there was an investigator who would
 
05:16:45.830 --> 05:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
reach out to the council for the
 
05:16:47.390 --> 05:16:47.400 align:start position:0%
plaintiffs in every malpractice suit
 
05:16:49.610 --> 05:16:49.620 align:start position:0%
asking for their client to sign
 
05:16:51.350 --> 05:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
authorizations to access the medical
 
05:16:54.110 --> 05:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
records since the administrative
 
05:16:56.570 --> 05:16:56.580 align:start position:0%
prosecution unit has been dissolved
 
05:16:58.250 --> 05:16:58.260 align:start position:0%
there are no requests coming to
 
05:17:01.128 --> 05:17:01.138 align:start position:0%
plaintiff's attorneys and um it's not
 
05:17:03.530 --> 05:17:03.540 align:start position:0%
the statute it sounds to me like we've
 
05:17:05.390 --> 05:17:05.400 align:start position:0%
fallen down in terms of our
 
05:17:07.368 --> 05:17:07.378 align:start position:0%
infrastructure our human infrastructure
 
05:17:09.830 --> 05:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
and respectfully representative I think
 
05:17:11.330 --> 05:17:11.340 align:start position:0%
that's the whole problem that may have
 
05:17:13.788 --> 05:17:13.798 align:start position:0%
been the Genesis of this Committee in
 
05:17:16.070 --> 05:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
the first place it's just that
 
05:17:18.350 --> 05:17:18.360 align:start position:0%
we've fallen down in oversight of the
 
05:17:19.850 --> 05:17:19.860 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine and what it's actually
 
05:17:21.590 --> 05:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
doing and and
 
05:17:23.690 --> 05:17:23.700 align:start position:0%
a large part of that is resources as
 
05:17:25.430 --> 05:17:25.440 align:start position:0%
you've heard they need more resources
 
05:17:29.208 --> 05:17:29.218 align:start position:0%
but a large part of it too is just that
 
05:17:30.948 --> 05:17:30.958 align:start position:0%
they aren't doing the investigations
 
05:17:33.470 --> 05:17:33.480 align:start position:0%
they should be doing well because we'll
 
05:17:35.690 --> 05:17:35.700 align:start position:0%
wait what the internal General says and
 
05:17:37.368 --> 05:17:37.378 align:start position:0%
we will make sure we get some money in
 
05:17:38.930 --> 05:17:38.940 align:start position:0%
the budget and then I have a fourth
 
05:17:38.940 --> 05:17:40.128 align:start position:0%
the budget and then I have a fourth
question

05:17:40.128 --> 05:17:40.138 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:17:40.138 --> 05:17:40.970 align:start position:0%
question
um

05:17:40.970 --> 05:17:40.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:44.150 --> 05:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
okay at this point the Board of Medicine
 
05:17:46.730 --> 05:17:46.740 align:start position:0%
as I understand it receives every
 
05:17:48.610 --> 05:17:48.620 align:start position:0%
malpractice case
 
05:17:51.650 --> 05:17:51.660 align:start position:0%
they are required to investigate every
 
05:17:54.350 --> 05:17:54.360 align:start position:0%
single one they make an independent
 
05:17:56.868 --> 05:17:56.878 align:start position:0%
determination of whether or not they
 
05:17:59.030 --> 05:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
should want to impose some kind of a
 
05:18:01.010 --> 05:18:01.020 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action on that physician
 
05:18:03.948 --> 05:18:03.958 align:start position:0%
based on the malpractice case before
 
05:18:03.958 --> 05:18:05.170 align:start position:0%
based on the malpractice case before
them

05:18:05.170 --> 05:18:05.180 align:start position:0%
them
 
05:18:09.170 --> 05:18:09.180 align:start position:0%
uh and presumably if they're competent
 
05:18:12.410 --> 05:18:12.420 align:start position:0%
in doing the right thing if they say
 
05:18:14.030 --> 05:18:14.040 align:start position:0%
that there should be disciplinary action
 
05:18:16.670 --> 05:18:16.680 align:start position:0%
then it is in fact reported but in their
 
05:18:20.050 --> 05:18:20.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:23.208 --> 05:18:23.218 align:start position:0%
an issue that should be reported they
 
05:18:25.670 --> 05:18:25.680 align:start position:0%
don't Levy disciplinary action that
 
05:18:28.490 --> 05:18:28.500 align:start position:0%
that's the processes I understand it I I
 
05:18:30.650 --> 05:18:30.660 align:start position:0%
think I was hearing you say that that's
 
05:18:33.530 --> 05:18:33.540 align:start position:0%
not enough that that that just the
 
05:18:36.050 --> 05:18:36.060 align:start position:0%
receipt of a malpractice case as long as
 
05:18:38.330 --> 05:18:38.340 align:start position:0%
it maybe meets these six tests by
 
05:18:40.730 --> 05:18:40.740 align:start position:0%
Vermont it ought to be reported but what
 
05:18:43.190 --> 05:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
is wrong with the New Hampshire way of
 
05:18:45.590 --> 05:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
having that independent thought put into
 
05:18:49.190 --> 05:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
it and they design deciding
 
05:18:51.170 --> 05:18:51.180 align:start position:0%
independently if they should impose
 
05:18:53.628 --> 05:18:53.638 align:start position:0%
discipline and it's the discipline that
 
05:18:56.448 --> 05:18:56.458 align:start position:0%
by the board that triggers the reporting
 
05:18:59.270 --> 05:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
is or is that is that a pro is that
 
05:19:02.510 --> 05:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
problematic to to either of you
 
05:19:05.448 --> 05:19:05.458 align:start position:0%
um I would say the problem is that I
 
05:19:07.730 --> 05:19:07.740 align:start position:0%
don't think the board has what it needs
 
05:19:10.128 --> 05:19:10.138 align:start position:0%
to do an adequate investigation there
 
05:19:12.310 --> 05:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
was some discussion earlier about
 
05:19:15.650 --> 05:19:15.660 align:start position:0%
plaintiff's lawyers and what we do to
 
05:19:17.868 --> 05:19:17.878 align:start position:0%
comb through the thousands of calls that
 
05:19:20.270 --> 05:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
come to us to decide what we could
 
05:19:24.470 --> 05:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
really prove in court was a practice
 
05:19:27.050 --> 05:19:27.060 align:start position:0%
below what you would expect from your
 
05:19:29.628 --> 05:19:29.638 align:start position:0%
average physician in that specialty and
 
05:19:32.448 --> 05:19:32.458 align:start position:0%
it takes us hours and hours of time
 
05:19:34.850 --> 05:19:34.860 align:start position:0%
reviewing medical records and hiring
 
05:19:37.010 --> 05:19:37.020 align:start position:0%
expensive experts and although we're not
 
05:19:39.288 --> 05:19:39.298 align:start position:0%
required by law to do that before we
 
05:19:42.350 --> 05:19:42.360 align:start position:0%
file suit we'd be crazy not to do it
 
05:19:44.628 --> 05:19:44.638 align:start position:0%
before we file soon and it looks to us
 
05:19:47.270 --> 05:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
from what we can tell happens to the
 
05:19:49.430 --> 05:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
cases that we file and then what happens
 
05:19:52.730 --> 05:19:52.740 align:start position:0%
with the board that they just don't have
 
05:19:57.650 --> 05:19:57.660 align:start position:0%
the adequate personnel and time and I'm
 
05:19:59.868 --> 05:19:59.878 align:start position:0%
not sure what else is happening but it's
 
05:20:01.430 --> 05:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
not happening they're not doing those
 
05:20:03.770 --> 05:20:03.780 align:start position:0%
kinds of thorough reviews in our our
 
05:20:06.830 --> 05:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
view I I think we may have stumbled on
 
05:20:09.890 --> 05:20:09.900 align:start position:0%
some violent agreement because on our
 
05:20:11.650 --> 05:20:11.660 align:start position:0%
last paragraph here
 
05:20:14.330 --> 05:20:14.340 align:start position:0%
implies it's it could it's a little
 
05:20:16.368 --> 05:20:16.378 align:start position:0%
minimal in the way it says it and the
 
05:20:19.128 --> 05:20:19.138 align:start position:0%
emphasis it puts on it but I think we
 
05:20:21.770 --> 05:20:21.780 align:start position:0%
understand that there is a staffing and
 
05:20:23.690 --> 05:20:23.700 align:start position:0%
financing issue here that needs to be
 
05:20:26.030 --> 05:20:26.040 align:start position:0%
looked at and the people that have to go
 
05:20:29.208 --> 05:20:29.218 align:start position:0%
first in the process is oplc they need
 
05:20:31.850 --> 05:20:31.860 align:start position:0%
to you know tell the governor what they
 
05:20:33.948 --> 05:20:33.958 align:start position:0%
need Governor needs to agree with them
 
05:20:36.350 --> 05:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
got to send it over to the legislature
 
05:20:39.470 --> 05:20:39.480 align:start position:0%
so so the first step in the I think I
 
05:20:41.390 --> 05:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
think we understand that and we want to
 
05:20:44.208 --> 05:20:44.218 align:start position:0%
fix that but but there's you know other
 
05:20:46.010 --> 05:20:46.020 align:start position:0%
people have to do things we're repeating
 
05:20:48.830 --> 05:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
ourselves here several times so
 
05:20:51.948 --> 05:20:51.958 align:start position:0%
thank you I am now going to take the
 
05:20:54.650 --> 05:20:54.660 align:start position:0%
last two speakers and you will have five
 
05:20:56.810 --> 05:20:56.820 align:start position:0%
minutes no more each thank you chairman
 
05:20:59.510 --> 05:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:02.330 --> 05:21:02.340 align:start position:0%
and please don't plow the ground that
 
05:21:06.530 --> 05:21:06.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:10.550 --> 05:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:12.470 --> 05:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
and you got five minutes
 
05:21:17.510 --> 05:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:19.368 --> 05:21:19.378 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
05:21:19.378 --> 05:21:20.830 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

05:21:20.830 --> 05:21:20.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:21:22.670 --> 05:21:22.680 align:start position:0%
members of the committee thank you for
 
05:21:24.470 --> 05:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
your time really addressing patient
 
05:21:25.730 --> 05:21:25.740 align:start position:0%
safety and quality of care it's so
 
05:21:26.990 --> 05:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
important and I appreciate what you're
 
05:21:29.270 --> 05:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
doing my name is Dr Roy Fami I've served
 
05:21:31.128 --> 05:21:31.138 align:start position:0%
in Bears leadership positions in
 
05:21:32.448 --> 05:21:32.458 align:start position:0%
multiple health systems for over a
 
05:21:34.788 --> 05:21:34.798 align:start position:0%
decade and I just like to address the
 
05:21:36.770 --> 05:21:36.780 align:start position:0%
fundamental issue of information flow
 
05:21:39.170 --> 05:21:39.180 align:start position:0%
and it's really regarding the
 
05:21:40.730 --> 05:21:40.740 align:start position:0%
disciplinary actions that are taken
 
05:21:42.288 --> 05:21:42.298 align:start position:0%
against a medical staff member
 
05:21:44.390 --> 05:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
originating from the institution or the
 
05:21:45.470 --> 05:21:45.480 align:start position:0%
health system this is from my
 
05:21:47.150 --> 05:21:47.160 align:start position:0%
perspective only please understand that
 
05:21:49.490 --> 05:21:49.500 align:start position:0%
but in my experience in observations
 
05:21:52.070 --> 05:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
institutions tend to fault heavily to
 
05:21:54.410 --> 05:21:54.420 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire statute of 15113 on
 
05:21:56.208 --> 05:21:56.218 align:start position:0%
the proceedings of Hospital committees
 
05:21:58.850 --> 05:21:58.860 align:start position:0%
confidentiality to really filter some of
 
05:22:00.650 --> 05:22:00.660 align:start position:0%
that information concerning disciplinary
 
05:22:02.330 --> 05:22:02.340 align:start position:0%
actions to the appropriate regulatory
 
05:22:04.190 --> 05:22:04.200 align:start position:0%
bodies and that may be one of the
 
05:22:05.750 --> 05:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
fundamental issues of the inflammation
 
05:22:07.670 --> 05:22:07.680 align:start position:0%
that's not getting to where it needs to
 
05:22:07.680 --> 05:22:08.390 align:start position:0%
that's not getting to where it needs to
go

05:22:08.390 --> 05:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
go
 
05:22:10.368 --> 05:22:10.378 align:start position:0%
and I guess my questions are can the
 
05:22:12.050 --> 05:22:12.060 align:start position:0%
statute be bolstered to mandate the
 
05:22:14.330 --> 05:22:14.340 align:start position:0%
institution to report and how is the
 
05:22:15.830 --> 05:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
institution held accountable for the
 
05:22:17.810 --> 05:22:17.820 align:start position:0%
lack of reporting for these disciplinary
 
05:22:17.820 --> 05:22:20.750 align:start position:0%
lack of reporting for these disciplinary
actions

05:22:20.750 --> 05:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:22.430 --> 05:22:22.440 align:start position:0%

05:22:32.580 --> 05:22:36.470 align:start position:0%
Nepal
okay

05:22:36.470 --> 05:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:38.830 --> 05:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for letting me speak
 
05:22:44.690 --> 05:22:44.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:46.850 --> 05:22:46.860 align:start position:0%
I had grandchildren over the weekend I'm
 
05:22:48.590 --> 05:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
not used to people hearing me
 
05:22:51.170 --> 05:22:51.180 align:start position:0%
thank you welcome so my name is Lori
 
05:22:54.830 --> 05:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
nerbon I'm a nurse um who is uh in
 
05:22:56.330 --> 05:22:56.340 align:start position:0%
charge of a small non-profit called New
 
05:22:58.310 --> 05:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
England patient voices it used to be New
 
05:23:00.350 --> 05:23:00.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire patient voices
 
05:23:02.750 --> 05:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
I work as a patient advocate often
 
05:23:04.670 --> 05:23:04.680 align:start position:0%
listening to Patient complaints or
 
05:23:06.230 --> 05:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
patient issues that they've had in
 
05:23:06.240 --> 05:23:07.788 align:start position:0%
patient issues that they've had in
hospitals

05:23:07.788 --> 05:23:07.798 align:start position:0%
hospitals
 
05:23:11.390 --> 05:23:11.400 align:start position:0%
from 2008 to 2012 I coordinated public
 
05:23:13.368 --> 05:23:13.378 align:start position:0%
testimony for patient safety legislation
 
05:23:15.110 --> 05:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
here about infection reporting and
 
05:23:17.810 --> 05:23:17.820 align:start position:0%
adverse event reporting
 
05:23:20.208 --> 05:23:20.218 align:start position:0%
what I would like to stress to this
 
05:23:22.670 --> 05:23:22.680 align:start position:0%
committee is we've talked a lot about
 
05:23:25.128 --> 05:23:25.138 align:start position:0%
the the weeds and the details of
 
05:23:28.250 --> 05:23:28.260 align:start position:0%
legislation and policies but we are here
 
05:23:30.350 --> 05:23:30.360 align:start position:0%
I just want to remind you that we are
 
05:23:34.070 --> 05:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
here to achieve the board's mission of
 
05:23:37.010 --> 05:23:37.020 align:start position:0%
safeguarding the public
 
05:23:39.530 --> 05:23:39.540 align:start position:0%
one of the patient testimonials that I
 
05:23:41.990 --> 05:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
coordinated back in 2009 for the adverse
 
05:23:45.170 --> 05:23:45.180 align:start position:0%
event reporting bill was a woman whose
 
05:23:49.128 --> 05:23:49.138 align:start position:0%
husband died after surgery by Dr barabow
 
05:23:53.570 --> 05:23:53.580 align:start position:0%
we're not using names here okay
 
05:23:53.580 --> 05:23:54.430 align:start position:0%
we're not using names here okay
um

05:23:54.430 --> 05:23:54.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:57.050 --> 05:23:57.060 align:start position:0%
transparency by way of State legislation
 
05:23:59.628 --> 05:23:59.638 align:start position:0%
has a direct impact by increasing public
 
05:24:02.690 --> 05:24:02.700 align:start position:0%
attention increasing funding research
 
05:24:05.150 --> 05:24:05.160 align:start position:0%
and most important prevention of what
 
05:24:07.550 --> 05:24:07.560 align:start position:0%
brought us here today
 
05:24:09.470 --> 05:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
all of us here know about health care
 
05:24:13.368 --> 05:24:13.378 align:start position:0%
infections now but back in 2004
 
05:24:16.788 --> 05:24:16.798 align:start position:0%
they were considered just an unavoidable
 
05:24:20.810 --> 05:24:20.820 align:start position:0%
consequence of being a hospital ICU
 
05:24:23.090 --> 05:24:23.100 align:start position:0%
now we know hospitals have gotten some
 
05:24:25.730 --> 05:24:25.740 align:start position:0%
of them to zero mandates and public
 
05:24:28.070 --> 05:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
pressure work
 
05:24:30.530 --> 05:24:30.540 align:start position:0%
although I see myself as an advocate for
 
05:24:32.990 --> 05:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
all patients I'm also here today as a
 
05:24:34.670 --> 05:24:34.680 align:start position:0%
nurse who has specialized in patient
 
05:24:37.310 --> 05:24:37.320 align:start position:0%
safety since the death of my mother
 
05:24:39.350 --> 05:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
more recently as a nurse patient
 
05:24:41.090 --> 05:24:41.100 align:start position:0%
advocate in acute care hospitals in
 
05:24:42.948 --> 05:24:42.958 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts investigating and
 
05:24:45.650 --> 05:24:45.660 align:start position:0%
processing patient complaints many of
 
05:24:47.628 --> 05:24:47.638 align:start position:0%
which involve physician and quality of
 
05:24:49.128 --> 05:24:49.138 align:start position:0%
care issues
 
05:24:51.830 --> 05:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
with and without patient injuries
 
05:24:53.868 --> 05:24:53.878 align:start position:0%
for one of those years I coordinated
 
05:24:55.610 --> 05:24:55.620 align:start position:0%
quality improvement projects in
 
05:24:57.230 --> 05:24:57.240 align:start position:0%
hospitals and nursing homes across New
 
05:24:58.850 --> 05:24:58.860 align:start position:0%
England under a contract with Medicare
 
05:25:00.410 --> 05:25:00.420 align:start position:0%
and Medicaid
 
05:25:03.170 --> 05:25:03.180 align:start position:0%
I just am here today to impress upon
 
05:25:05.930 --> 05:25:05.940 align:start position:0%
this panel and all legislators the vital
 
05:25:08.690 --> 05:25:08.700 align:start position:0%
role you play in patient safety
 
05:25:10.310 --> 05:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
as you may know medical harm and
 
05:25:12.590 --> 05:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
injuries are at the very least the third
 
05:25:15.350 --> 05:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
leading cause of death in America
 
05:25:19.010 --> 05:25:19.020 align:start position:0%
multiple Studies have validated this and
 
05:25:22.128 --> 05:25:22.138 align:start position:0%
a reason oig report for the second time
 
05:25:24.708 --> 05:25:24.718 align:start position:0%
calculated that preventable medical
 
05:25:28.070 --> 05:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
medical harm to Medicare patients alone
 
05:25:32.208 --> 05:25:32.218 align:start position:0%
is 15 000 per month
 
05:25:34.730 --> 05:25:34.740 align:start position:0%
this is not to ignore Medical Care is
 
05:25:36.770 --> 05:25:36.780 align:start position:0%
Advanced and performs miraculous care
 
05:25:38.810 --> 05:25:38.820 align:start position:0%
for many of the vast majority of Health
 
05:25:40.490 --> 05:25:40.500 align:start position:0%
Care profession and the majority of
 
05:25:42.110 --> 05:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
Health Care Professionals strive every
 
05:25:44.570 --> 05:25:44.580 align:start position:0%
day to achieve the highest standards of
 
05:25:44.580 --> 05:25:45.530 align:start position:0%
day to achieve the highest standards of
care

05:25:45.530 --> 05:25:45.540 align:start position:0%
care
 
05:25:48.410 --> 05:25:48.420 align:start position:0%
but regulatory oversight as well as
 
05:25:50.990 --> 05:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
state and federal laws play the most
 
05:25:53.810 --> 05:25:53.820 align:start position:0%
important role in preventing patient
 
05:25:53.820 --> 05:25:54.830 align:start position:0%
important role in preventing patient
harm

05:25:54.830 --> 05:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
harm
 
05:25:56.868 --> 05:25:56.878 align:start position:0%
they have the power to require that
 
05:25:58.850 --> 05:25:58.860 align:start position:0%
Health Care Facility leaders
 
05:26:01.070 --> 05:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
follow well-established laws and
 
05:26:03.650 --> 05:26:03.660 align:start position:0%
guidelines and I think if there's one
 
05:26:05.270 --> 05:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
thing to stress today
 
05:26:07.070 --> 05:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
the issue that we're dealing with is
 
05:26:09.288 --> 05:26:09.298 align:start position:0%
that there wasn't a following of the
 
05:26:10.970 --> 05:26:10.980 align:start position:0%
guidelines whether it was the Board of
 
05:26:13.250 --> 05:26:13.260 align:start position:0%
Medicine or whether it was hospitals or
 
05:26:14.990 --> 05:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
whoever that's what we need to get to
 
05:26:16.368 --> 05:26:16.378 align:start position:0%
the bottom of
 
05:26:16.378 --> 05:26:18.350 align:start position:0%
the bottom of
that

05:26:18.350 --> 05:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:26:21.410 --> 05:26:21.420 align:start position:0%
that a patient who was being operated on
 
05:26:23.628 --> 05:26:23.638 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire didn't have available
 
05:26:25.670 --> 05:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
to them the information they needed to
 
05:26:28.448 --> 05:26:28.458 align:start position:0%
make an informed decision
 
05:26:30.470 --> 05:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
one thing I want to point out that
 
05:26:32.090 --> 05:26:32.100 align:start position:0%
hasn't been mentioned today is the
 
05:26:34.190 --> 05:26:34.200 align:start position:0%
National Practitioner Data Bank does not
 
05:26:37.788 --> 05:26:37.798 align:start position:0%
allow Boards of medicine to publish
 
05:26:40.610 --> 05:26:40.620 align:start position:0%
anything any information about lawsuits
 
05:26:43.070 --> 05:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
or settlements on their website
 
05:26:44.690 --> 05:26:44.700 align:start position:0%
so in order to do that like
 
05:26:47.390 --> 05:26:47.400 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts does we need a state
 
05:26:49.190 --> 05:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
mandate to do that
 
05:26:51.230 --> 05:26:51.240 align:start position:0%
and I know that the committee has also
 
05:26:52.970 --> 05:26:52.980 align:start position:0%
decided not that you're not going to
 
05:26:55.128 --> 05:26:55.138 align:start position:0%
post settlements but I think it's
 
05:26:56.690 --> 05:26:56.700 align:start position:0%
important that
 
05:26:59.810 --> 05:26:59.820 align:start position:0%
in the process of
 
05:27:02.570 --> 05:27:02.580 align:start position:0%
a hospital credentialing committee or
 
05:27:04.550 --> 05:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
whoever is looking into looking at
 
05:27:07.128 --> 05:27:07.138 align:start position:0%
physician licensing they go to the
 
05:27:09.050 --> 05:27:09.060 align:start position:0%
National Practitioner databank to look
 
05:27:10.910 --> 05:27:10.920 align:start position:0%
at that information so does the Board of
 
05:27:12.590 --> 05:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
Medicine that's where they get it from
 
05:27:15.470 --> 05:27:15.480 align:start position:0%
so unless and I the attorney spoke to
 
05:27:18.470 --> 05:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
how there is a lapse in how the medical
 
05:27:20.750 --> 05:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
board is getting information about
 
05:27:20.760 --> 05:27:22.910 align:start position:0%
board is getting information about
lawsuits

05:27:22.910 --> 05:27:22.920 align:start position:0%
lawsuits
 
05:27:26.090 --> 05:27:26.100 align:start position:0%
and there is an enormous lapse
 
05:27:28.550 --> 05:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
or settlements there's an enormous lapse
 
05:27:28.560 --> 05:27:30.590 align:start position:0%
or settlements there's an enormous lapse
in

05:27:30.590 --> 05:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:27:32.810 --> 05:27:32.820 align:start position:0%
when a Haas it first of all our
 
05:27:34.850 --> 05:27:34.860 align:start position:0%
hospitals reporting disciplinary actions
 
05:27:36.830 --> 05:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
to the board
 
05:27:39.530 --> 05:27:39.540 align:start position:0%
who's auditing that how often is it
 
05:27:41.570 --> 05:27:41.580 align:start position:0%
happening and how often is is it not
 
05:27:41.580 --> 05:27:43.010 align:start position:0%
happening and how often is is it not
happening

05:27:43.010 --> 05:27:43.020 align:start position:0%
happening
 
05:27:44.930 --> 05:27:44.940 align:start position:0%
and the other important thing is to know
 
05:27:46.850 --> 05:27:46.860 align:start position:0%
about the loopholes that are often used
 
05:27:49.070 --> 05:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
to not report and that would be that
 
05:27:50.810 --> 05:27:50.820 align:start position:0%
they may decide you've got two minutes
 
05:27:53.208 --> 05:27:53.218 align:start position:0%
to finish up thank you that they may
 
05:27:55.430 --> 05:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
decide to only discipline a physician
 
05:27:58.010 --> 05:27:58.020 align:start position:0%
for 28 days if if the requirement is
 
05:28:00.708 --> 05:28:00.718 align:start position:0%
that it has to be 30 days
 
05:28:03.350 --> 05:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
so you point to chapter and verse on
 
05:28:05.930 --> 05:28:05.940 align:start position:0%
where 30 days is said so this is with
 
05:28:07.910 --> 05:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
the National Practitioner databank I
 
05:28:09.350 --> 05:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
what I would like is a point of
 
05:28:10.910 --> 05:28:10.920 align:start position:0%
clarification from the medical board
 
05:28:13.970 --> 05:28:13.980 align:start position:0%
about what their requirement is is it
 
05:28:15.948 --> 05:28:15.958 align:start position:0%
all disciplinary actions get reported to
 
05:28:15.958 --> 05:28:16.788 align:start position:0%
all disciplinary actions get reported to
them

05:28:16.788 --> 05:28:16.798 align:start position:0%
them
 
05:28:19.788 --> 05:28:19.798 align:start position:0%
or is it only a certain length of
 
05:28:21.288 --> 05:28:21.298 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action or loss of
 
05:28:22.610 --> 05:28:22.620 align:start position:0%
privileges I don't know that and I
 
05:28:25.850 --> 05:28:25.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:28.550 --> 05:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
pardon me
 
05:28:31.310 --> 05:28:31.320 align:start position:0%
do we do we know the answer to that I
 
05:28:34.128 --> 05:28:34.138 align:start position:0%
think it's an important point so if it's
 
05:28:37.788 --> 05:28:37.798 align:start position:0%
if it's it has to be 30 days yeah
 
05:28:40.850 --> 05:28:40.860 align:start position:0%
it's any disciplinary action
 
05:28:44.270 --> 05:28:44.280 align:start position:0%
okay it's a yes or no if if there was
 
05:28:47.628 --> 05:28:47.638 align:start position:0%
discipline then yes if not reported
 
05:28:49.670 --> 05:28:49.680 align:start position:0%

requirement
 
05:28:54.230 --> 05:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
I just want to leave you with when
 
05:28:55.730 --> 05:28:55.740 align:start position:0%
patients and their families make the
 
05:28:57.250 --> 05:28:57.260 align:start position:0%
difficult decision to have surgery
 
05:28:59.150 --> 05:28:59.160 align:start position:0%
they're placing their life and
 
05:29:00.890 --> 05:29:00.900 align:start position:0%
well-being and not only the surgeon's
 
05:29:03.410 --> 05:29:03.420 align:start position:0%
hands but Hospital administrators who
 
05:29:05.150 --> 05:29:05.160 align:start position:0%
are ultimately responsible for the safe
 
05:29:07.070 --> 05:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
practices in their facility
 
05:29:09.230 --> 05:29:09.240 align:start position:0%
they are compensated well to put patient
 
05:29:11.750 --> 05:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
safety ahead of all else and we need to
 
05:29:13.190 --> 05:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
be clear
 
05:29:16.490 --> 05:29:16.500 align:start position:0%
that in a case of 14 deaths eight within
 
05:29:19.250 --> 05:29:19.260 align:start position:0%
one summer and 21 lawsuits
 
05:29:22.310 --> 05:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
this was not a one-off this was not two
 
05:29:25.610 --> 05:29:25.620 align:start position:0%
or three honest mistakes hospitals have
 
05:29:27.530 --> 05:29:27.540 align:start position:0%
entire teams of patient safety
 
05:29:29.868 --> 05:29:29.878 align:start position:0%
professionals dedicated to measuring
 
05:29:32.090 --> 05:29:32.100 align:start position:0%
every surgeon's outcomes
 
05:29:34.430 --> 05:29:34.440 align:start position:0%
they track complications Adverse Events
 
05:29:36.948 --> 05:29:36.958 align:start position:0%

05:29:36.958 --> 05:29:38.270 align:start position:0%
infections and deaths and data doesn't
lie

05:29:38.270 --> 05:29:38.280 align:start position:0%
lie
 
05:29:40.128 --> 05:29:40.138 align:start position:0%
it would have been virtually impossible
 
05:29:42.050 --> 05:29:42.060 align:start position:0%
for the surgeon not to be a serious
 
05:29:42.060 --> 05:29:44.810 align:start position:0%
for the surgeon not to be a serious
outlier

05:29:44.810 --> 05:29:44.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:47.030 --> 05:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
if you have not already had the chance I
 
05:29:48.470 --> 05:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
urge you to read The Whistleblower

lawsuit
 
05:29:53.208 --> 05:29:53.218 align:start position:0%
it's very revealing and details the
 
05:29:55.010 --> 05:29:55.020 align:start position:0%
specifics of the medical care that was
 
05:29:55.020 --> 05:29:56.448 align:start position:0%
specifics of the medical care that was
provided

05:29:56.448 --> 05:29:56.458 align:start position:0%
provided
 
05:29:58.250 --> 05:29:58.260 align:start position:0%
I hope you agree that when bad things
 
05:30:00.530 --> 05:30:00.540 align:start position:0%
happen and the public safety is at stake
 
05:30:03.050 --> 05:30:03.060 align:start position:0%
it is all of our responsibility to do
 
05:30:04.550 --> 05:30:04.560 align:start position:0%
what we can to ensure it doesn't happen
 
05:30:04.560 --> 05:30:05.390 align:start position:0%
what we can to ensure it doesn't happen
again

05:30:05.390 --> 05:30:05.400 align:start position:0%
again
 
05:30:07.730 --> 05:30:07.740 align:start position:0%
we can't ignore or forget that multiple
 
05:30:09.530 --> 05:30:09.540 align:start position:0%
doctors and nurses inside the system
 
05:30:11.448 --> 05:30:11.458 align:start position:0%
sounded the alarm
 
05:30:14.030 --> 05:30:14.040 align:start position:0%
as a nurse I can't imagine how it felt
 
05:30:16.010 --> 05:30:16.020 align:start position:0%
to work every day knowing their concerns
 
05:30:17.930 --> 05:30:17.940 align:start position:0%
were not being addressed knowing another
 
05:30:19.850 --> 05:30:19.860 align:start position:0%
patient would likely be harmed or die
 
05:30:23.150 --> 05:30:23.160 align:start position:0%
under their watch it's demoralizing it's
 
05:30:24.830 --> 05:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
why wonderful people leave health care
 
05:30:27.470 --> 05:30:27.480 align:start position:0%
and it's also why patients Sue it's the
 
05:30:30.288 --> 05:30:30.298 align:start position:0%
only way they can get answers
 
05:30:35.590 --> 05:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:38.270 --> 05:30:38.280 align:start position:0%
you can provide written documentation
 
05:30:40.788 --> 05:30:40.798 align:start position:0%
sure yes you can but thank you so much
 
05:30:45.530 --> 05:30:45.540 align:start position:0%
my final word to anybody listening in if
 
05:30:46.850 --> 05:30:46.860 align:start position:0%
you want
 
05:30:49.128 --> 05:30:49.138 align:start position:0%
to give us input
 
05:30:53.510 --> 05:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
please don't give us the big overview of
 
05:30:56.090 --> 05:30:56.100 align:start position:0%
how the procedures work and hospitals
 
05:30:58.610 --> 05:30:58.620 align:start position:0%
function and so on we know that stuff
 
05:31:01.990 --> 05:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
we've heard it many times but
 
05:31:05.270 --> 05:31:05.280 align:start position:0%
don't but what we are asking is give us
 
05:31:07.850 --> 05:31:07.860 align:start position:0%
specifics don't tell us the law should
 
05:31:11.150 --> 05:31:11.160 align:start position:0%
change tell us which law by line item
 
05:31:14.948 --> 05:31:14.958 align:start position:0%
should change how
 
05:31:18.230 --> 05:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
we're not going to plow through big
 
05:31:20.990 --> 05:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
documents that tell us all kinds of
 
05:31:24.110 --> 05:31:24.120 align:start position:0%
generalizations we know that stuff
 
05:31:27.050 --> 05:31:27.060 align:start position:0%
you want us to make some changes
 
05:31:31.310 --> 05:31:31.320 align:start position:0%
tell us what laws what procedures and
 
05:31:33.890 --> 05:31:33.900 align:start position:0%
then give us suggested other language
 
05:31:36.170 --> 05:31:36.180 align:start position:0%
and we'll listen to that stuff because
 
05:31:38.810 --> 05:31:38.820 align:start position:0%
although our report has been accepted
 
05:31:41.750 --> 05:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
and is being turned into oversight next
 
05:31:41.760 --> 05:31:43.010 align:start position:0%
and is being turned into oversight next
month

05:31:43.010 --> 05:31:43.020 align:start position:0%
month
 
05:31:45.170 --> 05:31:45.180 align:start position:0%
I suspect there's going to be a couple
 
05:31:48.708 --> 05:31:48.718 align:start position:0%
of lsrs written either to establish a
 
05:31:51.650 --> 05:31:51.660 align:start position:0%
much more in-depth committee or to
 
05:31:54.890 --> 05:31:54.900 align:start position:0%
establish some changes in procedure so
 
05:31:57.830 --> 05:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
that is what we need is specific stuff
 
05:32:00.470 --> 05:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
so thank you everyone thank you
 
05:32:02.690 --> 05:32:02.700 align:start position:0%
committee it's been great thank you
 
05:32:05.330 --> 05:32:05.340 align:start position:0%
representative Solway for taking all of
 
05:32:07.070 --> 05:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
our stuff and turning it into a good
