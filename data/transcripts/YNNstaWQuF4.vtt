00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 align:start position:0%
am I right
 
00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
will downgrade the importance if they
 
00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 align:start position:0%

to study revisions to occupational
 
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 align:start position:0%
regulation of Pharmacists and pharmacies

hand in the pink card momentarily but
 
00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139 align:start position:0%
obviously I will take no questions
 
00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:51.050 align:start position:0%
obviously I will take no questions
thanks

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative I
 
00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 align:start position:0%
have no ping cards from anybody is there
 
00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479 align:start position:0%
anyone else who wishes to testify on
 
00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:11.570 align:start position:0%
anyone else who wishes to testify on
this

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 align:start position:0%
all right in that case I will close the
 
00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 align:start position:0%
and we're free until
 
00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:29.419 align:start position:0%
10 30. I
 
00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 align:start position:0%
should I go down and see if I can figure
 
00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:35.759 align:start position:0%
because he may
 
00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 align:start position:0%
yeah well that I mean we may reopen it
 
00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:42.419 align:start position:0%
sometime because both he and roachford
 
00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 align:start position:0%
well yeah but they don't if they don't
 
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:30.840 --> 00:23:28.210 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:28.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:30.529 --> 00:23:30.539 align:start position:0%
with the arrival of Representative
 
00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
Merchant I'm going to open reopen the
 
00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill 518
 
00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:40.980 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair chairwoman my
 
00:23:42.529 --> 00:23:42.539 align:start position:0%
apologies to the committee I also have
 
00:23:43.669 --> 00:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
another bill I'm trying to introduce
 
00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:46.380 align:start position:0%
downstairs at the same time and I should
 
00:23:48.169 --> 00:23:48.179 align:start position:0%
have found somebody to backfill me I did
 
00:23:49.669 --> 00:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
not so I apologize to the committee for
 
00:23:51.049 --> 00:23:51.059 align:start position:0%
that error
 
00:23:52.909 --> 00:23:52.919 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:55.620 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do here is the Border
 
00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:56.690 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do here is the Border
Pharmacy

00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:56.700 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy
 
00:23:58.370 --> 00:23:58.380 align:start position:0%
and they support the bill
 
00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
is to try to take RSA 318
 
00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
and look at the bill RSA collectively if
 
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
you will
 
00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:10.140 align:start position:0%
in the world of Pharmacy we have the
 
00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:11.400 align:start position:0%
business of Pharmacy we have the
 
00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:14.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
by looking at a study committee
 
00:24:18.409 --> 00:24:18.419 align:start position:0%
comprised of folks that have the
 
00:24:19.789 --> 00:24:19.799 align:start position:0%
knowledge base
 
00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:23.220 align:start position:0%
should we take 318 and separate the
 
00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
Business from The Practice
 
00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
so that's the intent of it it's a study
 
00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
committee I have folks willing to serve
 
00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:32.460 align:start position:0%
on the committee that's really the
 
00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:34.260 align:start position:0%
intent of it it's nothing more than that
 
00:24:36.649 --> 00:24:36.659 align:start position:0%
it's just get people together around the
 
00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:38.280 align:start position:0%
table and talk about this with
 
00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:40.500 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and saying is it time for
 
00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:41.570 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and saying is it time for
us

00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:41.580 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
to the evolution of Pharmacy
 
00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
take the business of Pharmacy and
 
00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:46.620 align:start position:0%
separate it from the practice of
 
00:24:48.289 --> 00:24:48.299 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy the pharmacist Practice
 
00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy the owners operate the business
 
00:24:54.409 --> 00:24:54.419 align:start position:0%
that's fundamentally what it's all about
 
00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:03.049 --> 00:25:03.059 align:start position:0%
yeah thanks I I guess I'm usually
 
00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:04.740 align:start position:0%
skeptical of these things
 
00:25:06.409 --> 00:25:06.419 align:start position:0%
um because basically from the time it
 
00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:08.100 align:start position:0%
passes you're gonna have maybe three
 
00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:10.980 align:start position:0%
months maybe four uh before the
 
00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
reporting deadlines I mean do you have
 
00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
people lined up who are going to
 
00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
actually meet and work on this
 
00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:19.260 align:start position:0%
enough that it's going to do something
 
00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:22.020 align:start position:0%
useful I guess in my question thank you
 
00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
for the question represent Lucas people
 
00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
have told me they're willing to serve on
 
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
it but you never know until you actually
 
00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:29.580 align:start position:0%
hold the meeting two actually is going
 
00:25:31.789 --> 00:25:31.799 align:start position:0%
to show up but I have the support of the
 
00:25:33.289 --> 00:25:33.299 align:start position:0%
board I have support of people within
 
00:25:36.169 --> 00:25:36.179 align:start position:0%
the profession to talk about this
 
00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
um so my intent is to work on those
 
00:25:39.649 --> 00:25:39.659 align:start position:0%
individuals that have shown the interest
 
00:25:39.659 --> 00:25:40.970 align:start position:0%
individuals that have shown the interest
yes

00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:40.980 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:44.340 align:start position:0%
all right thank you reference favor
 
00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:46.620 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
00:25:49.970 --> 00:25:49.980 align:start position:0%
being here my question is when you I
 
00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:52.620 align:start position:0%
understand that this is just just a bill
 
00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:55.140 align:start position:0%
to establish a commission to study it
 
00:25:57.529 --> 00:25:57.539 align:start position:0%
but when you say separate the business
 
00:26:00.649 --> 00:26:00.659 align:start position:0%
from the practice can you elaborate on
 
00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:02.580 align:start position:0%
that please especially when I hear that
 
00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:05.400 align:start position:0%
the owners wouldn't be involved I
 
00:26:08.029 --> 00:26:08.039 align:start position:0%
I'm not understanding thank you the
 
00:26:09.649 --> 00:26:09.659 align:start position:0%
owners would be involved that would be
 
00:26:09.659 --> 00:26:10.610 align:start position:0%
owners would be involved that would be
the

00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:10.620 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
chain drug stores and so forth along
 
00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:14.460 align:start position:0%
with Independence
 
00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
um basically with how you run a pharmacy
 
00:26:18.049 --> 00:26:18.059 align:start position:0%
now how you practice Pharmacy but how
 
00:26:19.730 --> 00:26:19.740 align:start position:0%
you run the business
 
00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:22.440 align:start position:0%
so therefore it's been completed it's
 
00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:25.980 align:start position:0%
been co-mingled so as we evolve Pharmacy
 
00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:28.260 align:start position:0%
more into a clinical role dealing with
 
00:26:29.269 --> 00:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
patient care
 
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
I think it's important that we have an
 
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
RSA dealing with that growth of Pharmacy
 
00:26:36.649 --> 00:26:36.659 align:start position:0%
not have it still Anchored In what I
 
00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:38.100 align:start position:0%
call the business of Pharmacy which is
 
00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:41.510 align:start position:0%
call the business of Pharmacy which is
Mercantile

00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:43.980 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair give me a real
 
00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
world example so you own the pharmacy
 
00:26:49.090 --> 00:26:49.100 align:start position:0%
and I'm your pharmacist
 
00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:53.700 align:start position:0%
and what is the reason for separating
 
00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:55.740 align:start position:0%
can you give a real world example thank
 
00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:56.450 align:start position:0%
can you give a real world example thank
you

00:26:56.450 --> 00:26:56.460 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:26:59.029 --> 00:26:59.039 align:start position:0%
good example of that is that I'll give
 
00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
you more of analogy
 
00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:02.450 align:start position:0%
you more of analogy
in

00:27:02.450 --> 00:27:02.460 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:03.830 align:start position:0%
in
medicine

00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
medicine
 
00:27:06.529 --> 00:27:06.539 align:start position:0%
the Physicians have their own RSA but
 
00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:08.700 align:start position:0%
the hospitals also who run the business
 
00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
have their own RSA facility management
 
00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:14.580 align:start position:0%
they don't have them commingled together
 
00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
so the Board of Medicine is responsible
 
00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:19.140 align:start position:0%
for the practitioner
 
00:27:20.269 --> 00:27:20.279 align:start position:0%
Department Health Human Services
 
00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:23.220 align:start position:0%
responsible for how the hospitals run
 
00:27:25.669 --> 00:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
but in Pharmacy because it evolved out
 
00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:28.440 align:start position:0%
of the Mercantile business environment
 
00:27:30.649 --> 00:27:30.659 align:start position:0%
a lot of the RSA is really
 
00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:32.700 align:start position:0%
on how you run the business so give an
 
00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:35.640 align:start position:0%
example we have how many hours you have
 
00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
to have the pharmacy open that has
 
00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:38.640 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with how you practice
 
00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:40.740 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy it's a question how often the
 
00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:43.020 align:start position:0%
hospital is open for instance so that
 
00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do is is it time for us
 
00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:47.400 align:start position:0%
to look at it globally
 
00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:50.580 align:start position:0%
and say is it wise to break it apart or
 
00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:52.500 align:start position:0%
is it just leave it alone and move on
 
00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:59.510 --> 00:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative O'Brien
 
00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:01.620 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
with this committee I'm just looking
 
00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
well as you hope in the future if this
 
00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:08.580 align:start position:0%
passes and I look at different things
 
00:28:11.149 --> 00:28:11.159 align:start position:0%
like good RX and different things where
 
00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:13.980 align:start position:0%
uh I imagine most of the drugs come from
 
00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:17.940 align:start position:0%
one or two uh Central Outlet uh but you
 
00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:19.980 align:start position:0%
go to one Pharmacy there one price you
 
00:28:21.769 --> 00:28:21.779 align:start position:0%
go to another Pharmacy they're another
 
00:28:24.649 --> 00:28:24.659 align:start position:0%
price and then if you had the coupons
 
00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
they're even possibly less would that be
 
00:28:30.370 --> 00:28:30.380 align:start position:0%
within the scope of this try to look at
 
00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
regulating the business better for the
 
00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
consumer it's not trying to
 
00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:38.100 align:start position:0%
create regulations not trying to create
 
00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
law we're just trying to make the
 
00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:41.580 align:start position:0%
Judgment call back to this legislative
 
00:28:44.029 --> 00:28:44.039 align:start position:0%
body is it time to take the two
 
00:28:45.769 --> 00:28:45.779 align:start position:0%
components which are weaved together
 
00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:48.360 align:start position:0%
today and separate them in two separate
 
00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
chapters within the RSA so one is going
 
00:28:52.970 --> 00:28:52.980 align:start position:0%
to deal with representative O'Brien your
 
00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
point that's the business how you price
 
00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
things how I practice as a pharmacist
 
00:28:58.310 --> 00:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do without the owner
 
00:29:01.549 --> 00:29:01.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
representative Dolan
 
00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:05.340 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:29:07.549 --> 00:29:07.559 align:start position:0%
I thank you representative
 
00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:10.860 align:start position:0%
um my question is in the context of the
 
00:29:12.769 --> 00:29:12.779 align:start position:0%
fact that we're the legislature is
 
00:29:15.049 --> 00:29:15.059 align:start position:0%
drowning in committees and commissions
 
00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:17.820 align:start position:0%
and this is going to be another one can
 
00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:20.100 align:start position:0%
you give me the uh what you think the
 
00:29:22.269 --> 00:29:22.279 align:start position:0%
life cycle of this commission would be
 
00:29:25.789 --> 00:29:25.799 align:start position:0%
starting and finishing representative
 
00:29:28.730 --> 00:29:28.740 align:start position:0%
Dolan the bond section two of the bill
 
00:29:30.769 --> 00:29:30.779 align:start position:0%
repeals the commission effective
 
00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:34.620 align:start position:0%
November 1st 2023. so this is a very
 
00:29:40.510 --> 00:29:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:43.549 --> 00:29:43.559 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:29:45.649 --> 00:29:45.659 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:47.580 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much
 
00:29:49.549 --> 00:29:49.559 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant and thank you
 
00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:55.320 align:start position:0%
unfortunately you got here before the
 
00:29:57.049 --> 00:29:57.059 align:start position:0%
next hearing was scheduled so we could
 
00:29:58.850 --> 00:29:58.860 align:start position:0%
indulge you
 
00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
any is there anyone else who wishes to
 
00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:02.990 align:start position:0%
any is there anyone else who wishes to
testify

00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
testify
 
00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:06.360 align:start position:0%
all right I will close the hearing again
 
00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:10.559 align:start position:0%
I don't think don't think this needs
 
00:30:10.559 --> 00:30:12.289 align:start position:0%
I don't think don't think this needs
subcommittee

00:30:12.289 --> 00:30:12.299 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:19.610 --> 00:30:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:22.370 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:22.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
does it cost the taxpayers any money to
 
00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
establish a commission
 
00:30:29.389 --> 00:30:29.399 align:start position:0%
uh well there's the cost of processing
 
00:30:32.450 --> 00:30:32.460 align:start position:0%
the paperwork and then there's mileage
 
00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
for legislative members but it's
 
00:30:39.049 --> 00:30:39.059 align:start position:0%
generally relatively cheap
 
00:30:41.269 --> 00:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
the non-legislative members don't get
 
00:30:47.169 --> 00:30:47.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:50.389 --> 00:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
it would have to be in other bills
 
00:30:50.399 --> 00:30:51.110 align:start position:0%
it would have to be in other bills
um

00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:52.789 --> 00:30:52.799 align:start position:0%
next year
 
00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
or they can just get together
 
00:30:57.230 --> 00:30:57.240 align:start position:0%
and talk about it and do it without us
 
00:30:59.930 --> 00:30:59.940 align:start position:0%
passing a bill too which has been known
 
00:31:03.470 --> 00:31:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:13.190 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:15.529 --> 00:31:15.539 align:start position:0%
all right then
 
00:31:15.539 --> 00:31:53.810 align:start position:0%
all right then
foreign

00:31:53.810 --> 00:31:53.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:53.820 --> 00:32:43.010 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:43.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:43.020 --> 00:34:06.909 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:34:06.909 --> 00:34:06.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:10.089 --> 00:34:10.099 align:start position:0%
all right good morning
 
00:34:12.169 --> 00:34:12.179 align:start position:0%

00:34:14.290 --> 00:34:14.300 align:start position:0%
I'm opening the hearing on House Bill
 
00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
532 I looks like representative Broda
 
00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
wants to introduce the bill
 
00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:22.200 align:start position:0%
I do thank you madam chair
 
00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
House Bill 532
 
00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:25.190 align:start position:0%
House Bill 532
um

00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:29.149 --> 00:34:29.159 align:start position:0%
request the licensing the licensing and
 
00:34:29.159 --> 00:34:29.810 align:start position:0%
request the licensing the licensing and
um

00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:29.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:32.530 --> 00:34:32.540 align:start position:0%
for music therapists in New Hampshire
 
00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
this bill is one that has come to you
 
00:34:37.669 --> 00:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
before in this committee
 
00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:42.800 align:start position:0%
and represents and there has been a
 
00:34:45.889 --> 00:34:45.899 align:start position:0%
ongoing negotiations between the speech
 
00:34:48.649 --> 00:34:48.659 align:start position:0%
therapists and music therapists
 
00:34:51.950 --> 00:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
and I think we've come to an agreement
 
00:34:54.470 --> 00:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
because I just spoke to the speech
 
00:34:57.950 --> 00:34:57.960 align:start position:0%
therapist people and we have the music
 
00:35:00.829 --> 00:35:00.839 align:start position:0%
therapist who will confirm this that
 
00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
speech that music therapy does not treat
 
00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:06.720 align:start position:0%
speech therapy
 
00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:09.660 align:start position:0%
it treats people with speech therapy
 
00:35:12.589 --> 00:35:12.599 align:start position:0%
speech disorders sorry let me say that
 
00:35:16.130 --> 00:35:16.140 align:start position:0%
again speech therapy speech therapists
 
00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:18.660 align:start position:0%
work with people who need who have
 
00:35:21.109 --> 00:35:21.119 align:start position:0%
issues with speech communication
 
00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
but um a music therapist doesn't treat
 
00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:28.200 align:start position:0%
speech disorders but it works with
 
00:35:30.349 --> 00:35:30.359 align:start position:0%
people who works with people who have
 
00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
them and there's a collaboration between
 
00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:33.900 align:start position:0%
the two
 
00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:35.400 align:start position:0%
the amen there is going to be an
 
00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:37.020 align:start position:0%
amendment to this bill which will help
 
00:35:38.810 --> 00:35:38.820 align:start position:0%
clarify this
 
00:35:41.210 --> 00:35:41.220 align:start position:0%
and I think that that will prepare the
 
00:35:43.490 --> 00:35:43.500 align:start position:0%
bill for this committee to
 
00:35:47.329 --> 00:35:47.339 align:start position:0%
understand finally and support the bill
 
00:35:49.490 --> 00:35:49.500 align:start position:0%
I will not take any questions because I
 
00:35:51.890 --> 00:35:51.900 align:start position:0%
know you've put a few people to testify
 
00:35:58.670 --> 00:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:01.130 --> 00:36:01.140 align:start position:0%
may I ask a question Madam chair please
 
00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:03.720 align:start position:0%
okay so representative Gorda did not
 
00:36:05.329 --> 00:36:05.339 align:start position:0%
want to take questions but I believe
 
00:36:09.170 --> 00:36:09.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:12.780 align:start position:0%
we haven't seen it yet right
 
00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:16.380 align:start position:0%
I'll submit it to OLS once we get it um
 
00:36:18.349 --> 00:36:18.359 align:start position:0%
nailed down
 
00:36:18.359 --> 00:36:19.670 align:start position:0%
nailed down
okay

00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:21.230 align:start position:0%
okay
fine

00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
fine
 
00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
in in that regard I will start out by
 
00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:26.220 align:start position:0%
while we're waiting for the pink cards
 
00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:29.460 align:start position:0%
to come around we'll I will mention that
 
00:36:31.370 --> 00:36:31.380 align:start position:0%
this bill will be going to the licensing
 
00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:33.720 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and
 
00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
nothing will happen until that amendment
 
00:36:44.930 --> 00:36:44.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:46.370 align:start position:0%

real Comfort I have found in any of the
 
00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
therapies that I have tried has been
 
00:38:28.069 --> 00:38:28.079 align:start position:0%
music therapy music has been a part of
 
00:38:29.890 --> 00:38:29.900 align:start position:0%
my life for as long as I can remember
 
00:38:33.530 --> 00:38:33.540 align:start position:0%
it's one of the things I lean on most
 
00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:36.540 align:start position:0%
um but the interesting thing about how
 
00:38:38.750 --> 00:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
music therapy has helped me
 
00:38:40.250 --> 00:38:40.260 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
with complicated trauma such as complex
 
00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:44.569 align:start position:0%
with complicated trauma such as complex
PTSD

00:38:44.569 --> 00:38:44.579 align:start position:0%
PTSD
 
00:38:46.970 --> 00:38:46.980 align:start position:0%
there really isn't always a way to
 
00:38:49.069 --> 00:38:49.079 align:start position:0%
express what you're feeling sometimes
 
00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
you can't there aren't words it's not as
 
00:38:53.210 --> 00:38:53.220 align:start position:0%
simple as talking it through at a talk
 
00:38:55.490 --> 00:38:55.500 align:start position:0%
therapy session which I have done for
 
00:38:58.310 --> 00:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
let's see I'm 32 today is my birthday
 
00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
the past 20 years of my life
 
00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
um so I actually in learning about this
 
00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation I was actually
 
00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:08.329 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation I was actually
shocked

00:39:08.329 --> 00:39:08.339 align:start position:0%
shocked
 
00:39:11.870 --> 00:39:11.880 align:start position:0%
um that it's not already possible for
 
00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
music therapists to Bill Insurance to
 
00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
have licensure in this state in addition
 
00:39:19.609 --> 00:39:19.619 align:start position:0%
to the fact that we are one of the last
 
00:39:21.890 --> 00:39:21.900 align:start position:0%
in the country for access to mental
 
00:39:23.290 --> 00:39:23.300 align:start position:0%
health treatment
 
00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
we also have a serious issue with
 
00:39:28.810 --> 00:39:28.820 align:start position:0%
keeping health care workers in our state
 
00:39:33.170 --> 00:39:33.180 align:start position:0%
just recently nhpr was discussing the
 
00:39:36.050 --> 00:39:36.060 align:start position:0%
housing crisis and the effect on the
 
00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
mental health Workforce there is an
 
00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:40.020 align:start position:0%
alliance in Dover called the Mental
 
00:39:41.210 --> 00:39:41.220 align:start position:0%
Health Alliance they have also
 
00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
identified this as a challenge in the
 
00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
Dover Community where they've
 
00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
experienced quite a bit of tragedy due
 
00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
to Suicide loss so I would just press
 
00:39:55.069 --> 00:39:55.079 align:start position:0%
you as somebody that is both a person in
 
00:39:58.670 --> 00:39:58.680 align:start position:0%
recovery a person with you know a mental
 
00:40:01.490 --> 00:40:01.500 align:start position:0%
illness that I have tried for years to
 
00:40:03.770 --> 00:40:03.780 align:start position:0%
find help for and now have to pay out of
 
00:40:07.130 --> 00:40:07.140 align:start position:0%
pocket for and can hardly afford it I
 
00:40:08.770 --> 00:40:08.780 align:start position:0%
can't imagine how many other people
 
00:40:12.650 --> 00:40:12.660 align:start position:0%
could benefit from this you know it's
 
00:40:14.569 --> 00:40:14.579 align:start position:0%
it's one of those things that you're
 
00:40:17.810 --> 00:40:17.820 align:start position:0%
able to express yourself and get things
 
00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:20.220 align:start position:0%
out and have this thing in front of you
 
00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:21.720 align:start position:0%
to say oh my gosh there's this beautiful
 
00:40:25.849 --> 00:40:25.859 align:start position:0%
piece of music I'd also say that I
 
00:40:29.450 --> 00:40:29.460 align:start position:0%
originally was connected with music and
 
00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
art therapy through working with a
 
00:40:34.810 --> 00:40:34.820 align:start position:0%
crisis program that I had needed After
 
00:40:37.390 --> 00:40:37.400 align:start position:0%
experiencing domestic abuse
 
00:40:39.890 --> 00:40:39.900 align:start position:0%
and every person I've talked to when I'm
 
00:40:41.329 --> 00:40:41.339 align:start position:0%
trying to find care for my daughter
 
00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
who's six has said you should go to the
 
00:40:45.589 --> 00:40:45.599 align:start position:0%
sonatina center however you have to pay
 
00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
out of pocket but it's worth every penny
 
00:40:51.109 --> 00:40:51.119 align:start position:0%
nothing has worked this well so I just
 
00:40:54.050 --> 00:40:54.060 align:start position:0%
say please support this bill for people
 
00:40:56.329 --> 00:40:56.339 align:start position:0%
like me who are health care workers who
 
00:40:58.310 --> 00:40:58.320 align:start position:0%
are mothers who are trying to be leaders
 
00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
in their community and also experiencing
 
00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
things that you probably would never
 
00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:03.589 align:start position:0%
things that you probably would never
know

00:41:03.589 --> 00:41:03.599 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
um it's one out of four people so people
 
00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
sitting on this on this committee or
 
00:41:10.430 --> 00:41:10.440 align:start position:0%
have some experience with mental illness
 
00:41:12.530 --> 00:41:12.540 align:start position:0%
and substance use disorder
 
00:41:15.290 --> 00:41:15.300 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions
 
00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
thank you and I appreciate your showing
 
00:41:20.690 --> 00:41:20.700 align:start position:0%
up on your birthday
 
00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:22.490 align:start position:0%
up on your birthday
representative

00:41:22.490 --> 00:41:22.500 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:25.140 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair maybe this
 
00:41:27.890 --> 00:41:27.900 align:start position:0%
question is better for my colleague
 
00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:28.490 align:start position:0%
question is better for my colleague
um

00:41:28.490 --> 00:41:28.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:31.370 --> 00:41:31.380 align:start position:0%
representative groda for
 
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
the is the reason for this bill to
 
00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:39.240 align:start position:0%
license it in order for insurance is
 
00:41:42.109 --> 00:41:42.119 align:start position:0%
that the sole reason that is always one
 
00:41:44.690 --> 00:41:44.700 align:start position:0%
of the major reasons for any health care
 
00:41:47.089 --> 00:41:47.099 align:start position:0%
profession is that many insurance
 
00:41:49.730 --> 00:41:49.740 align:start position:0%
companies will only
 
00:41:53.329 --> 00:41:53.339 align:start position:0%
allow licensed individuals to directly
 
00:41:53.339 --> 00:41:55.430 align:start position:0%
allow licensed individuals to directly
bill

00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:41:59.690 --> 00:41:59.700 align:start position:0%
may I please sure um so there's also a
 
00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
piece where you cannot apply to build
 
00:42:04.609 --> 00:42:04.619 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Medicaid so not only is it
 
00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
private insurance companies it's also
 
00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
State Medicaid so any family or
 
00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
individual seeking these Services if
 
00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
they happen to come across them
 
00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:15.240 align:start position:0%
um we'll have to pay for them out of
 
00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:16.550 align:start position:0%
um we'll have to pay for them out of
pocket

00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
pocket
 
00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
um so it's just something really worth
 
00:42:20.690 --> 00:42:20.700 align:start position:0%
noting and again the the access to
 
00:42:22.849 --> 00:42:22.859 align:start position:0%
mental health treatment in in our state
 
00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
is is really frustrating and this is
 
00:42:28.670 --> 00:42:28.680 align:start position:0%
also a piece of our art and culture in
 
00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:30.900 align:start position:0%
our state and I think those two things
 
00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:31.790 align:start position:0%
our state and I think those two things
really

00:42:31.790 --> 00:42:31.800 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:33.540 align:start position:0%
um the fact that these can be addressed
 
00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
together especially in our community in
 
00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
Rochester we are really into our art and
 
00:42:40.849 --> 00:42:40.859 align:start position:0%
our music I can just see how much more
 
00:42:43.069 --> 00:42:43.079 align:start position:0%
this will benefit people if they can if
 
00:42:46.250 --> 00:42:46.260 align:start position:0%
these providers can bill to it
 
00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:47.640 align:start position:0%
um you know it would encourage more
 
00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
people to to seek
 
00:42:51.829 --> 00:42:51.839 align:start position:0%
um using this type of treatment to help
 
00:42:55.210 --> 00:42:55.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:57.470 --> 00:42:57.480 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:42:59.630 --> 00:42:59.640 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
so the intent is to be able to actually
 
00:43:03.290 --> 00:43:03.300 align:start position:0%
bill out for the service which makes
 
00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
sense but would you be opposed to having
 
00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
no penalty provision for those that are
 
00:43:09.050 --> 00:43:09.060 align:start position:0%
practicing without said license does it
 
00:43:10.490 --> 00:43:10.500 align:start position:0%
really matter to have because I'm just
 
00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
concerned well I'm sorry I'll answer
 
00:43:13.490 --> 00:43:13.500 align:start position:0%
that question
 
00:43:15.890 --> 00:43:15.900 align:start position:0%
so I'll be candid I don't know all this
 
00:43:18.290 --> 00:43:18.300 align:start position:0%
the specifics around that I know that
 
00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
there are other folks here um that have
 
00:43:23.089 --> 00:43:23.099 align:start position:0%
been more involved in this process so I
 
00:43:24.829 --> 00:43:24.839 align:start position:0%
can't answer that question but I would
 
00:43:26.990 --> 00:43:27.000 align:start position:0%
definitely say that to my understanding
 
00:43:29.089 --> 00:43:29.099 align:start position:0%
there are people that are licensed that
 
00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
are not able to Bill and that's really
 
00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:33.180 align:start position:0%
important to me unsure about the piece
 
00:43:38.710 --> 00:43:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:41.329 --> 00:43:41.339 align:start position:0%
but you're receiving you receive sound
 
00:43:42.829 --> 00:43:42.839 align:start position:0%
therapy right in music therapy right now
 
00:43:44.930 --> 00:43:44.940 align:start position:0%
correct correct I'm an unlicensed
 
00:43:44.940 --> 00:43:47.329 align:start position:0%
correct correct I'm an unlicensed
provider

00:43:47.329 --> 00:43:47.339 align:start position:0%
provider
 
00:43:49.309 --> 00:43:49.319 align:start position:0%
it must be since we don't that's fine
 
00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
right so yes so they're they're they're
 
00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
certified they have credentials they go
 
00:43:56.630 --> 00:43:56.640 align:start position:0%
through you know okay but but right now
 
00:43:58.730 --> 00:43:58.740 align:start position:0%
it's not licensed it cannot they cannot
 
00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:00.900 align:start position:0%
be licensed without a state licensure
 
00:44:03.890 --> 00:44:03.900 align:start position:0%
system is the issue so follow my
 
00:44:05.390 --> 00:44:05.400 align:start position:0%
follow-up my point being that you're
 
00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
receiving the serviceman unlicensed
 
00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
provider right now so your service would
 
00:44:10.849 --> 00:44:10.859 align:start position:0%
not change with the stamp of approval so
 
00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:12.180 align:start position:0%
being we could have something that's
 
00:44:13.609 --> 00:44:13.619 align:start position:0%
unlicensed people could still be
 
00:44:15.370 --> 00:44:15.380 align:start position:0%
unlicensed it would not affect
 
00:44:17.930 --> 00:44:17.940 align:start position:0%
your treatment
 
00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
correct I could still keep attending
 
00:44:22.069 --> 00:44:22.079 align:start position:0%
treatment it's just it's the cost folks
 
00:44:24.770 --> 00:44:24.780 align:start position:0%
for folks it's that cost piece it's you
 
00:44:27.349 --> 00:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
know 80 to you know could be up to 150 a
 
00:44:30.109 --> 00:44:30.119 align:start position:0%
session and for for families that's
 
00:44:33.050 --> 00:44:33.060 align:start position:0%
especially in my area where we Face some
 
00:44:34.790 --> 00:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
of the most
 
00:44:36.290 --> 00:44:36.300 align:start position:0%
um intense
 
00:44:39.109 --> 00:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
um you know costs of living and housing
 
00:44:41.210 --> 00:44:41.220 align:start position:0%
um it's really just so inaccessible for
 
00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:42.349 align:start position:0%
um it's really just so inaccessible for
folks

00:44:42.349 --> 00:44:42.359 align:start position:0%
folks
 
00:44:45.349 --> 00:44:45.359 align:start position:0%
thank you representative thank you um
 
00:44:47.450 --> 00:44:47.460 align:start position:0%
maybe I misheard you human spoke but I
 
00:44:48.890 --> 00:44:48.900 align:start position:0%
thought I heard you say that there are
 
00:44:50.990 --> 00:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
people who are licensed who cannot get
 
00:44:53.690 --> 00:44:53.700 align:start position:0%
reimbursed that may have been a mistake
 
00:44:55.670 --> 00:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
on my part so I meant what I met was
 
00:44:57.050 --> 00:44:57.060 align:start position:0%
thinking license was saying that like
 
00:44:58.790 --> 00:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
they go through certifications they go
 
00:45:01.069 --> 00:45:01.079 align:start position:0%
through schooling they you know they go
 
00:45:03.050 --> 00:45:03.060 align:start position:0%
through that same process that and often
 
00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
I believe like they have other you know
 
00:45:06.050 --> 00:45:06.060 align:start position:0%
things they specialize in and this can
 
00:45:07.730 --> 00:45:07.740 align:start position:0%
just be like another thing that they can
 
00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
offer such as like if someone's doing
 
00:45:11.329 --> 00:45:11.339 align:start position:0%
art therapy they can then now
 
00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
incorporate music therapy as well but
 
00:45:14.809 --> 00:45:14.819 align:start position:0%
again I'm not the expert on this I'm a
 
00:45:16.730 --> 00:45:16.740 align:start position:0%
patient and there are
 
00:45:18.650 --> 00:45:18.660 align:start position:0%
um therapists that are here today too
 
00:45:21.770 --> 00:45:21.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:23.329 --> 00:45:23.339 align:start position:0%
thank you for so much for your testimony
 
00:45:25.250 --> 00:45:25.260 align:start position:0%
uh you mentioned a session could cost
 
00:45:28.250 --> 00:45:28.260 align:start position:0%
180 is that correct is that for an hour
 
00:45:30.349 --> 00:45:30.359 align:start position:0%
is that for like is that just for the
 
00:45:32.210 --> 00:45:32.220 align:start position:0%
individual is that yeah yeah that's just
 
00:45:34.370 --> 00:45:34.380 align:start position:0%
for about an individual or an hour I'll
 
00:45:37.130 --> 00:45:37.140 align:start position:0%
ultimately say that um I was going on a
 
00:45:38.990 --> 00:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
scholarship through that I actually was
 
00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
connected through uh to with the doorway
 
00:45:44.030 --> 00:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
which is part of the um Continuum of
 
00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:45.540 align:start position:0%
Care for substance use in New Hampshire
 
00:45:47.809 --> 00:45:47.819 align:start position:0%
so um they're aware of it they know it
 
00:45:47.819 --> 00:45:48.890 align:start position:0%
so um they're aware of it they know it
works

00:45:48.890 --> 00:45:48.900 align:start position:0%
works
 
00:45:52.069 --> 00:45:52.079 align:start position:0%
um and sorry I forgot your question no
 
00:45:55.010 --> 00:45:55.020 align:start position:0%

00:45:57.829 --> 00:45:57.839 align:start position:0%

00:45:57.839 --> 00:45:58.730 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien thank you madam
chair

00:45:58.730 --> 00:45:58.740 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:46:00.710 --> 00:46:00.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question you may
 
00:46:03.290 --> 00:46:03.300 align:start position:0%
not be able to answer this and I'm glad
 
00:46:05.809 --> 00:46:05.819 align:start position:0%
that the therapy is working out good for
 
00:46:09.650 --> 00:46:09.660 align:start position:0%
you that's positive uh but I think the
 
00:46:11.690 --> 00:46:11.700 align:start position:0%
committee would like to know what's
 
00:46:13.849 --> 00:46:13.859 align:start position:0%
happening in other states New Hampshire
 
00:46:17.170 --> 00:46:17.180 align:start position:0%
live free and die but however
 
00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
to see if this program exists into
 
00:46:23.809 --> 00:46:23.819 align:start position:0%
success as in other states I think that
 
00:46:25.970 --> 00:46:25.980 align:start position:0%
would help us come to a conclusion on
 
00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:26.930 align:start position:0%
would help us come to a conclusion on
this

00:46:26.930 --> 00:46:26.940 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:46:29.930 --> 00:46:29.940 align:start position:0%
so I can't answer that question
 
00:46:31.609 --> 00:46:31.619 align:start position:0%
um I think that somebody else would yeah
 
00:46:33.650 --> 00:46:33.660 align:start position:0%
I can't answer that question thank you I
 
00:46:35.089 --> 00:46:35.099 align:start position:0%
was more putting it out there when
 
00:46:36.950 --> 00:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
somebody comes up to speak and maybe
 
00:46:39.290 --> 00:46:39.300 align:start position:0%
they'll be a better qualified but I
 
00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for your attempt
 
00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:43.430 align:start position:0%

00:46:48.960 --> 00:47:00.650 align:start position:0%
I like to call Stephanie uh
renef

00:47:00.650 --> 00:47:00.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:03.950 --> 00:47:03.960 align:start position:0%
hi I'm Stephanie Rooney from Derry I
 
00:47:05.329 --> 00:47:05.339 align:start position:0%
grew up in Salem
 
00:47:07.010 --> 00:47:07.020 align:start position:0%
good morning Madam chair and good
 
00:47:09.050 --> 00:47:09.060 align:start position:0%
morning Representatives I have been a
 
00:47:10.849 --> 00:47:10.859 align:start position:0%
board certified music therapist since
 
00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
2001. I graduated from Anna Maria
 
00:47:14.809 --> 00:47:14.819 align:start position:0%
College which at the time there were
 
00:47:16.490 --> 00:47:16.500 align:start position:0%
only three colleges in New England where
 
00:47:18.770 --> 00:47:18.780 align:start position:0%
you could obtain a music therapy degree
 
00:47:20.930 --> 00:47:20.940 align:start position:0%
after that degree program we have to
 
00:47:22.550 --> 00:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
attend at that time it was over a
 
00:47:25.130 --> 00:47:25.140 align:start position:0%
thousand forty hours unpaid
 
00:47:27.950 --> 00:47:27.960 align:start position:0%
to receive our certification so when I
 
00:47:29.390 --> 00:47:29.400 align:start position:0%
came back to New Hampshire I was so
 
00:47:31.250 --> 00:47:31.260 align:start position:0%
excited to go into nursing homework
 
00:47:32.569 --> 00:47:32.579 align:start position:0%
because I am also a dementia
 
00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
practitioner when I came home in 2001
 
00:47:37.550 --> 00:47:37.560 align:start position:0%
and I had been working at Shriners burn
 
00:47:39.170 --> 00:47:39.180 align:start position:0%
Hospital working with the burn children
 
00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
using music therapy I got to help them
 
00:47:43.010 --> 00:47:43.020 align:start position:0%
with their pain I got to help them with
 
00:47:44.930 --> 00:47:44.940 align:start position:0%
their schoolwork and I got to help them
 
00:47:46.490 --> 00:47:46.500 align:start position:0%
die peacefully
 
00:47:48.890 --> 00:47:48.900 align:start position:0%
and that is a huge burden especially as
 
00:47:51.290 --> 00:47:51.300 align:start position:0%
a new professional but it was amazing to
 
00:47:53.329 --> 00:47:53.339 align:start position:0%
have that experience as a new
 
00:47:54.589 --> 00:47:54.599 align:start position:0%
professional that I could bring home to
 
00:47:56.089 --> 00:47:56.099 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire because while
 
00:47:58.010 --> 00:47:58.020 align:start position:0%
in in the state of Texas I worked on
 
00:48:00.050 --> 00:48:00.060 align:start position:0%
their task force to make sure that their
 
00:48:01.550 --> 00:48:01.560 align:start position:0%
music therapists are licensed so that
 
00:48:04.250 --> 00:48:04.260 align:start position:0%
they can be reimbursed for the amazing
 
00:48:06.770 --> 00:48:06.780 align:start position:0%
services that they do and throughout my
 
00:48:09.710 --> 00:48:09.720 align:start position:0%
career I was working for over 20 years I
 
00:48:11.630 --> 00:48:11.640 align:start position:0%
came back to the state and I couldn't
 
00:48:15.050 --> 00:48:15.060 align:start position:0%
get a job I had to move in 2002 all the
 
00:48:16.910 --> 00:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
way to New Orleans to work at Children's
 
00:48:19.430 --> 00:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
Hospital where there I was assigned to
 
00:48:21.710 --> 00:48:21.720 align:start position:0%
the NICU I saw a babies born without
 
00:48:25.130 --> 00:48:25.140 align:start position:0%
brains I saw their parents have to deal
 
00:48:26.210 --> 00:48:26.220 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:48:29.690 --> 00:48:29.700 align:start position:0%
it was harsh especially as a mom
 
00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
so I was there to be able to comfort
 
00:48:33.890 --> 00:48:33.900 align:start position:0%
that mother and help that child as best
 
00:48:35.870 --> 00:48:35.880 align:start position:0%
I could I also worked on the oncology
 
00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:36.890 align:start position:0%
I could I also worked on the oncology
floor

00:48:36.890 --> 00:48:36.900 align:start position:0%
floor
 
00:48:39.349 --> 00:48:39.359 align:start position:0%
I had one patient that only survived
 
00:48:40.609 --> 00:48:40.619 align:start position:0%
three weeks
 
00:48:43.309 --> 00:48:43.319 align:start position:0%
but what a miraculous opportunity I had
 
00:48:45.230 --> 00:48:45.240 align:start position:0%
to provide that person
 
00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
some music some comfort in their last
 
00:48:48.770 --> 00:48:48.780 align:start position:0%
days of their lives
 
00:48:50.270 --> 00:48:50.280 align:start position:0%
and if you don't mind I'd like to share
 
00:48:52.250 --> 00:48:52.260 align:start position:0%
a little personally too
 
00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
back in 2011 when I returned to the
 
00:48:57.770 --> 00:48:57.780 align:start position:0%
state I was returning to New Hampshire
 
00:48:59.630 --> 00:48:59.640 align:start position:0%
in hopes again for a full-time music
 
00:49:01.730 --> 00:49:01.740 align:start position:0%
therapy job because I had held one for
 
00:49:03.950 --> 00:49:03.960 align:start position:0%
10 years in the state of Texas I had
 
00:49:06.829 --> 00:49:06.839 align:start position:0%
worked in schools assisted living senior
 
00:49:08.569 --> 00:49:08.579 align:start position:0%
care everything that I could
 
00:49:10.130 --> 00:49:10.140 align:start position:0%
and we moved back to New Hampshire
 
00:49:13.069 --> 00:49:13.079 align:start position:0%
because my husband needed care in Boston
 
00:49:16.609 --> 00:49:16.619 align:start position:0%
he was a paraplegic and he had become so
 
00:49:19.370 --> 00:49:19.380 align:start position:0%
ill that he needed hospice
 
00:49:21.349 --> 00:49:21.359 align:start position:0%
well I was so excited to be back in New
 
00:49:23.450 --> 00:49:23.460 align:start position:0%
England with all of my former classmates
 
00:49:25.370 --> 00:49:25.380 align:start position:0%
and all of my colleagues
 
00:49:27.410 --> 00:49:27.420 align:start position:0%
but I couldn't get a job as a music
 
00:49:29.809 --> 00:49:29.819 align:start position:0%
therapist to support our family when he
 
00:49:31.130 --> 00:49:31.140 align:start position:0%
was unable to work
 
00:49:34.010 --> 00:49:34.020 align:start position:0%
and when he needed hospice care I
 
00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
couldn't find a hospice that had a music
 
00:49:38.210 --> 00:49:38.220 align:start position:0%
therapist that could provide the
 
00:49:42.410 --> 00:49:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:43.849 --> 00:49:43.859 align:start position:0%
I wonder
 
00:49:46.790 --> 00:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
with love for music
 
00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:48.170 align:start position:0%
with love for music
my

00:49:48.170 --> 00:49:48.180 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:49:49.849 --> 00:49:49.859 align:start position:0%
training and the training of the other
 
00:49:52.010 --> 00:49:52.020 align:start position:0%
professionals if he would have had a
 
00:49:54.349 --> 00:49:54.359 align:start position:0%
more peaceful death
 
00:49:56.329 --> 00:49:56.339 align:start position:0%
if we had been able to provide him with
 
00:49:57.470 --> 00:49:57.480 align:start position:0%
this service
 
00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
so I'm so thankful for the person who
 
00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
spoke before me because some of our
 
00:50:04.130 --> 00:50:04.140 align:start position:0%
clients and some of our patients are
 
00:50:05.930 --> 00:50:05.940 align:start position:0%
here today to tell you about how music
 
00:50:07.970 --> 00:50:07.980 align:start position:0%
therapy has affected them
 
00:50:10.010 --> 00:50:10.020 align:start position:0%
I can speak to what it's like to be a
 
00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:10.970 align:start position:0%
I can speak to what it's like to be a
professional

00:50:10.970 --> 00:50:10.980 align:start position:0%
professional
 
00:50:12.950 --> 00:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
I can't speak to what it's like to have
 
00:50:14.690 --> 00:50:14.700 align:start position:0%
received music therapy
 
00:50:16.309 --> 00:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
but I can tell you how it would have
 
00:50:18.410 --> 00:50:18.420 align:start position:0%
helped me say goodbye to my husband
 
00:50:21.050 --> 00:50:21.060 align:start position:0%
during those days
 
00:50:22.790 --> 00:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for listening to my
 
00:50:25.010 --> 00:50:25.020 align:start position:0%
testimony I really hope you passed this
 
00:50:27.170 --> 00:50:27.180 align:start position:0%
because it would mean it would mean that
 
00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:29.640 align:start position:0%
many of us could support our families we
 
00:50:30.890 --> 00:50:30.900 align:start position:0%
could be reimbursed through insurance
 
00:50:33.410 --> 00:50:33.420 align:start position:0%
companies to be able to stay here in New
 
00:50:35.690 --> 00:50:35.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire unlike me who graduated in
 
00:50:38.329 --> 00:50:38.339 align:start position:0%
2001 got certified and had to leave
 
00:50:40.550 --> 00:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
so thank you for hearing me today I'm
 
00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:42.720 align:start position:0%
open to any questions thank you very
 
00:50:45.710 --> 00:50:45.720 align:start position:0%
much for representing Brody you can't
 
00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
you've testified
 
00:50:48.910 --> 00:50:48.920 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
anyone else representative Schmidt
 
00:50:55.370 --> 00:50:55.380 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so there was some
 
00:50:56.990 --> 00:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
confusion at the beginning of the
 
00:50:59.809 --> 00:50:59.819 align:start position:0%
hearing with regard to the question of
 
00:50:59.819 --> 00:51:01.210 align:start position:0%
hearing with regard to the question of
Licensing

00:51:01.210 --> 00:51:01.220 align:start position:0%
Licensing
 
00:51:05.390 --> 00:51:05.400 align:start position:0%
and it got conflated in my view with uh
 
00:51:08.990 --> 00:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
whether somebody is a certified or
 
00:51:11.290 --> 00:51:11.300 align:start position:0%
trained professional
 
00:51:15.109 --> 00:51:15.119 align:start position:0%
so is it not the case that that music
 
00:51:15.119 --> 00:51:16.690 align:start position:0%
so is it not the case that that music
therapist

00:51:16.690 --> 00:51:16.700 align:start position:0%
therapist
 
00:51:20.750 --> 00:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
music therapy is a profession a
 
00:51:22.849 --> 00:51:22.859 align:start position:0%
recognized profession which requires
 
00:51:26.589 --> 00:51:26.599 align:start position:0%
training and training is provided in
 
00:51:31.910 --> 00:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
Nationwide uh so other training in that
 
00:51:34.730 --> 00:51:34.740 align:start position:0%
line other training facilities here in
 
00:51:37.370 --> 00:51:37.380 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire or do you have to go to
 
00:51:40.010 --> 00:51:40.020 align:start position:0%
Boston for example well currently there
 
00:51:42.290 --> 00:51:42.300 align:start position:0%
are none and never have been any in New
 
00:51:45.890 --> 00:51:45.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and one one program is closing
 
00:51:47.870 --> 00:51:47.880 align:start position:0%
the Anna Maria College program that I
 
00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
attended and was able to study with Dr
 
00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:52.440 align:start position:0%
Lisa Summer one of the most renowned
 
00:51:56.150 --> 00:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
music therapists is ending in 2025. so
 
00:51:59.210 --> 00:51:59.220 align:start position:0%
it is it is unfortunately
 
00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
we're losing we're losing strength
 
00:52:04.370 --> 00:52:04.380 align:start position:0%
because not every state
 
00:52:07.130 --> 00:52:07.140 align:start position:0%
has approved life licensure New York has
 
00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:09.240 align:start position:0%
Texas has many other states I don't know
 
00:52:10.670 --> 00:52:10.680 align:start position:0%
the exact number of states that have
 
00:52:12.349 --> 00:52:12.359 align:start position:0%
approved the licensure but yes you're
 
00:52:15.170 --> 00:52:15.180 align:start position:0%
correct we go through four years of
 
00:52:16.910 --> 00:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
training people will speak more to this
 
00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
as well and then we have to do our
 
00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
internship under professionals just like
 
00:52:22.490 --> 00:52:22.500 align:start position:0%
a social worker would have to when
 
00:52:24.530 --> 00:52:24.540 align:start position:0%
they're going to get their licensure so
 
00:52:27.710 --> 00:52:27.720 align:start position:0%
we do a lot of the same things but we
 
00:52:30.349 --> 00:52:30.359 align:start position:0%
are not recognized with a license
 
00:52:38.210 --> 00:52:38.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:39.950 --> 00:52:39.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
00:52:41.569 --> 00:52:41.579 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
00:52:43.849 --> 00:52:43.859 align:start position:0%
can you tell me
 
00:52:46.790 --> 00:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
what a music therapy session would
 
00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
entail how
 
00:52:50.930 --> 00:52:50.940 align:start position:0%
what happens during that time absolutely
 
00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
it it's different for everyone because
 
00:52:54.530 --> 00:52:54.540 align:start position:0%
what's so unique about what music
 
00:52:57.109 --> 00:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
therapists do is that we're able to
 
00:52:59.329 --> 00:52:59.339 align:start position:0%
First assess somebody like a social
 
00:53:02.329 --> 00:53:02.339 align:start position:0%
worker a speech therapist a physical
 
00:53:04.430 --> 00:53:04.440 align:start position:0%
therapist anybody who does an assessment
 
00:53:06.650 --> 00:53:06.660 align:start position:0%
so we would have an assessment session
 
00:53:08.270 --> 00:53:08.280 align:start position:0%
where we determine if someone would
 
00:53:09.829 --> 00:53:09.839 align:start position:0%
benefit from music therapy services
 
00:53:12.829 --> 00:53:12.839 align:start position:0%
because that's the other problem is that
 
00:53:15.829 --> 00:53:15.839 align:start position:0%
if you're not a trained professional and
 
00:53:17.390 --> 00:53:17.400 align:start position:0%
you're not a board-certified music
 
00:53:19.130 --> 00:53:19.140 align:start position:0%
therapist how do you know if music would
 
00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
be appropriate and what absolutely help
 
00:53:22.910 --> 00:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
someone because there are times when
 
00:53:24.829 --> 00:53:24.839 align:start position:0%
music could harm someone
 
00:53:27.049 --> 00:53:27.059 align:start position:0%
and we don't want to harm anyone either
 
00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
so that's why licensure is very
 
00:53:32.510 --> 00:53:32.520 align:start position:0%
important to me as well so let's just
 
00:53:34.609 --> 00:53:34.619 align:start position:0%
say that we've had an assessment and
 
00:53:37.250 --> 00:53:37.260 align:start position:0%
let's say I'm working is there a
 
00:53:38.690 --> 00:53:38.700 align:start position:0%
particular population you'd like to know
 
00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
like in the schools in the hospitals we
 
00:53:44.270 --> 00:53:44.280 align:start position:0%
work with we work in every Health Care
 
00:53:46.069 --> 00:53:46.079 align:start position:0%
setting education
 
00:53:48.589 --> 00:53:48.599 align:start position:0%
what would best help you let's say a
 
00:53:50.569 --> 00:53:50.579 align:start position:0%
school-aged individual okay so School
 
00:53:53.450 --> 00:53:53.460 align:start position:0%
we're we're trying to help them attain
 
00:53:55.930 --> 00:53:55.940 align:start position:0%
some academic
 
00:54:00.410 --> 00:54:00.420 align:start position:0%
aspect so let's say a child is possibly
 
00:54:02.569 --> 00:54:02.579 align:start position:0%
echolalic so we have a child who has
 
00:54:04.970 --> 00:54:04.980 align:start position:0%
autism so this person is just echoing
 
00:54:06.589 --> 00:54:06.599 align:start position:0%
everything they hear echoing everything
 
00:54:08.329 --> 00:54:08.339 align:start position:0%
they hear echoing everything they hear
 
00:54:11.270 --> 00:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
so one of the things I might do as a
 
00:54:14.750 --> 00:54:14.760 align:start position:0%
music therapist is ask them to have
 
00:54:18.589 --> 00:54:18.599 align:start position:0%
three spontaneous words within a
 
00:54:20.569 --> 00:54:20.579 align:start position:0%
30-minute session so instead of
 
00:54:23.390 --> 00:54:23.400 align:start position:0%
repeating everything I'm saying I would
 
00:54:26.870 --> 00:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
use a song like in the jungle
 
00:54:30.290 --> 00:54:30.300 align:start position:0%
and where we have we would have possibly
 
00:54:32.210 --> 00:54:32.220 align:start position:0%
some manipulatives to help this child so
 
00:54:34.370 --> 00:54:34.380 align:start position:0%
I would be singing in the jungle and I
 
00:54:37.609 --> 00:54:37.619 align:start position:0%
could say in the jungle the mighty
 
00:54:39.950 --> 00:54:39.960 align:start position:0%
jungle the lion
 
00:54:43.190 --> 00:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
and I wait for the child to tell me what
 
00:54:46.910 --> 00:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:48.829 --> 00:54:48.839 align:start position:0%
and so we know how music affects the
 
00:54:52.069 --> 00:54:52.079 align:start position:0%
brain we know how music is fun and so
 
00:54:53.630 --> 00:54:53.640 align:start position:0%
there's so many other components of what
 
00:54:56.450 --> 00:54:56.460 align:start position:0%
we do that truly reaches some children
 
00:54:59.150 --> 00:54:59.160 align:start position:0%
that are considered unreachable does
 
00:55:00.530 --> 00:55:00.540 align:start position:0%
that help
 
00:55:03.170 --> 00:55:03.180 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
00:55:06.170 --> 00:55:06.180 align:start position:0%
any yes representative Fitzpatrick
 
00:55:09.530 --> 00:55:09.540 align:start position:0%
most certifications have a book of Book
 
00:55:10.609 --> 00:55:10.619 align:start position:0%
of Knowledge
 
00:55:12.950 --> 00:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
can you give some examples of what's
 
00:55:15.349 --> 00:55:15.359 align:start position:0%
contained in your be okay
 
00:55:20.329 --> 00:55:20.339 align:start position:0%
we have in each type of person we work
 
00:55:23.870 --> 00:55:23.880 align:start position:0%
with we have uh I can't think of what
 
00:55:25.190 --> 00:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
it's called please forgive me I also
 
00:55:27.049 --> 00:55:27.059 align:start position:0%
have a um a debilitating disease that
 
00:55:28.609 --> 00:55:28.619 align:start position:0%
causes some brain fog so I appreciate
 
00:55:31.549 --> 00:55:31.559 align:start position:0%
your patience with me so we have
 
00:55:33.829 --> 00:55:33.839 align:start position:0%
standards of practice and within those
 
00:55:36.170 --> 00:55:36.180 align:start position:0%
standards of practice it tells us how we
 
00:55:38.510 --> 00:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
can and work with and not work with
 
00:55:40.549 --> 00:55:40.559 align:start position:0%
individuals so we have to do an
 
00:55:43.069 --> 00:55:43.079 align:start position:0%
assessment we have certain regulations
 
00:55:45.109 --> 00:55:45.119 align:start position:0%
under that and I know that these other
 
00:55:46.190 --> 00:55:46.200 align:start position:0%
music therapists will be able to speak
 
00:55:48.010 --> 00:55:48.020 align:start position:0%
to it better than I can at this time
 
00:55:50.510 --> 00:55:50.520 align:start position:0%
so there's there's everything you could
 
00:55:54.349 --> 00:55:54.359 align:start position:0%
imagine in that poke when when how long
 
00:55:56.150 --> 00:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
our duration of services will be the
 
00:55:57.890 --> 00:55:57.900 align:start position:0%
length uh the quality of the services
 
00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
when termination needs to be done when a
 
00:56:03.290 --> 00:56:03.300 align:start position:0%
referral needs to be given to another
 
00:56:06.170 --> 00:56:06.180 align:start position:0%
music therapist or if if there is an
 
00:56:07.970 --> 00:56:07.980 align:start position:0%
incident where they might benefit from
 
00:56:11.390 --> 00:56:11.400 align:start position:0%
another therapy so yes it contains quite
 
00:56:12.950 --> 00:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
everything that we would need to know
 
00:56:15.829 --> 00:56:15.839 align:start position:0%
and in order for a university or College
 
00:56:17.750 --> 00:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
to have a program they have to meet
 
00:56:21.109 --> 00:56:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:24.710 --> 00:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
follow up and so I would just uh I'm
 
00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
making the Assumption and what you just
 
00:56:29.750 --> 00:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
told me would be part of the contents of
 
00:56:32.450 --> 00:56:32.460 align:start position:0%
the examination that yes we do we do
 
00:56:35.690 --> 00:56:35.700 align:start position:0%
have an examination post hour training
 
00:56:39.349 --> 00:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
to hold the title music therapist board
 
00:56:41.930 --> 00:56:41.940 align:start position:0%
certified thank you
 
00:56:44.150 --> 00:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
representative Lucas
 
00:56:46.910 --> 00:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
um thank you so you mentioned that music
 
00:56:49.190 --> 00:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
therapy could actually cause harm could
 
00:56:51.890 --> 00:56:51.900 align:start position:0%
you offer some reasonably specific
 
00:56:54.349 --> 00:56:54.359 align:start position:0%
examples of that well I can I can give
 
00:56:56.270 --> 00:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
you two examples
 
00:56:59.450 --> 00:56:59.460 align:start position:0%
um when someone is inactive dying
 
00:57:02.530 --> 00:57:02.540 align:start position:0%
sometimes they can be extremely agitated
 
00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
and at a point when somebody's extremely
 
00:57:08.089 --> 00:57:08.099 align:start position:0%
agitated we might not want to bring
 
00:57:10.670 --> 00:57:10.680 align:start position:0%
another stimulus like music into that
 
00:57:12.770 --> 00:57:12.780 align:start position:0%
room and that would go for children as
 
00:57:15.049 --> 00:57:15.059 align:start position:0%
well if they're if they're extremely
 
00:57:16.670 --> 00:57:16.680 align:start position:0%
agitated because of a mental health
 
00:57:20.030 --> 00:57:20.040 align:start position:0%
issue or again autism something like
 
00:57:21.829 --> 00:57:21.839 align:start position:0%
that that would not be the most
 
00:57:24.470 --> 00:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
opportune time to use music therapy
 
00:57:26.450 --> 00:57:26.460 align:start position:0%
especially if you are new to the person
 
00:57:29.809 --> 00:57:29.819 align:start position:0%
if you had a relationship a therapeutic
 
00:57:31.970 --> 00:57:31.980 align:start position:0%
relationship with that person there's
 
00:57:34.130 --> 00:57:34.140 align:start position:0%
ways that we know how we might be able
 
00:57:35.630 --> 00:57:35.640 align:start position:0%
to reach them
 
00:57:38.630 --> 00:57:38.640 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
00:57:40.670 --> 00:57:40.680 align:start position:0%

00:57:59.390 --> 00:57:59.400 align:start position:0%
because I'm not licensed with the state
 
00:58:00.530 --> 00:58:00.540 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire I cannot provide the
 
00:58:01.849 --> 00:58:01.859 align:start position:0%
justification for the therapy I am
 
00:58:03.650 --> 00:58:03.660 align:start position:0%
providing as such families must take the
 
00:58:05.270 --> 00:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
extra step of securing a note from a
 
00:58:06.829 --> 00:58:06.839 align:start position:0%
different licensed professional to
 
00:58:09.109 --> 00:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
justify Music Therapy Services while
 
00:58:10.670 --> 00:58:10.680 align:start position:0%
this is a workaround for now it often
 
00:58:11.930 --> 00:58:11.940 align:start position:0%
adds extra time to setting up music
 
00:58:13.670 --> 00:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
therapy services for clients and it goes
 
00:58:14.870 --> 00:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
on from there so I understand the
 
00:58:17.150 --> 00:58:17.160 align:start position:0%
workarounds of pain but at the same time
 
00:58:19.130 --> 00:58:19.140 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note associated with this
 
00:58:21.530 --> 00:58:21.540 align:start position:0%
bill 60 something thousand dollars so I
 
00:58:23.930 --> 00:58:23.940 align:start position:0%
just wonder basically the state would
 
00:58:25.370 --> 00:58:25.380 align:start position:0%
then be taking up the burden of
 
00:58:27.170 --> 00:58:27.180 align:start position:0%
administering these notes so I'm saying
 
00:58:30.410 --> 00:58:30.420 align:start position:0%
if as as such the service could be
 
00:58:32.510 --> 00:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
provided by one Central psychologist
 
00:58:34.370 --> 00:58:34.380 align:start position:0%
providing notes to the music therapy
 
00:58:36.650 --> 00:58:36.660 align:start position:0%
providers and then getting reimbursed
 
00:58:39.170 --> 00:58:39.180 align:start position:0%
is that incorrect that is incorrect okay
 
00:58:42.710 --> 00:58:42.720 align:start position:0%
we do how it would work very much like
 
00:58:44.569 --> 00:58:44.579 align:start position:0%
physical therapists that say you or I go
 
00:58:47.390 --> 00:58:47.400 align:start position:0%
to the doctor we get a referral and a
 
00:58:49.490 --> 00:58:49.500 align:start position:0%
written prescription for that physical
 
00:58:53.030 --> 00:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
therapy at this time we it's very
 
00:58:56.329 --> 00:58:56.339 align:start position:0%
difficult for anyone to get that written
 
00:58:58.370 --> 00:58:58.380 align:start position:0%
notice from
 
00:59:00.710 --> 00:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
a healthcare provider that you need
 
00:59:02.630 --> 00:59:02.640 align:start position:0%
music therapy so that that's one of the
 
00:59:04.370 --> 00:59:04.380 align:start position:0%
burdens that we're facing so right now
 
00:59:07.309 --> 00:59:07.319 align:start position:0%
instead of getting it directly from from
 
00:59:10.309 --> 00:59:10.319 align:start position:0%
the from the physician per se now the
 
00:59:12.650 --> 00:59:12.660 align:start position:0%
family has to go back I can't I can't as
 
00:59:14.210 --> 00:59:14.220 align:start position:0%
a professional can't call that person
 
00:59:16.309 --> 00:59:16.319 align:start position:0%
again now the family who wants the
 
00:59:18.230 --> 00:59:18.240 align:start position:0%
service has to go back and ask for that
 
00:59:20.089 --> 00:59:20.099 align:start position:0%
prescription so to speak to be written
 
00:59:20.099 --> 00:59:22.870 align:start position:0%
prescription so to speak to be written
appreciate

00:59:22.870 --> 00:59:22.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
00:59:25.730 --> 00:59:25.740 align:start position:0%
so would you say that some of these
 
00:59:27.349 --> 00:59:27.359 align:start position:0%
other professionals don't believe in
 
00:59:28.430 --> 00:59:28.440 align:start position:0%
music therapy because they're not
 
00:59:31.190 --> 00:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
issuing these notes for referral I don't
 
00:59:32.510 --> 00:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
think that they don't believe in I think
 
00:59:34.250 --> 00:59:34.260 align:start position:0%
they actually use a lot of music I just
 
00:59:36.349 --> 00:59:36.359 align:start position:0%
don't think that they are as aware of
 
00:59:38.450 --> 00:59:38.460 align:start position:0%
they could be of our services and that's
 
00:59:39.829 --> 00:59:39.839 align:start position:0%
part of why we would like to become
 
00:59:42.109 --> 00:59:42.119 align:start position:0%
licensed just to have the opportunity to
 
00:59:44.329 --> 00:59:44.339 align:start position:0%
teach them more and to help them further
 
00:59:45.589 --> 00:59:45.599 align:start position:0%
help their
 
00:59:45.599 --> 00:59:47.030 align:start position:0%
help their
clients

00:59:47.030 --> 00:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
clients
 
00:59:50.390 --> 00:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Lucas thank you
 
00:59:51.770 --> 00:59:51.780 align:start position:0%
I mean if
 
00:59:54.230 --> 00:59:54.240 align:start position:0%
sure let me offer a clarification the
 
00:59:56.450 --> 00:59:56.460 align:start position:0%
licensing is paid for by the license
 
00:59:59.150 --> 00:59:59.160 align:start position:0%
fees yes paid by the licensees so the
 
01:00:01.250 --> 01:00:01.260 align:start position:0%
music therapist would be paying for it
 
01:00:02.690 --> 01:00:02.700 align:start position:0%
thank you yes thank you for the
 
01:00:05.390 --> 01:00:05.400 align:start position:0%
clarification any other questions uh yes
 
01:00:07.430 --> 01:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
representative Gould
 
01:00:10.430 --> 01:00:10.440 align:start position:0%
so for those families who
 
01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:11.450 align:start position:0%
so for those families who
um

01:00:11.450 --> 01:00:11.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:13.250 --> 01:00:13.260 align:start position:0%
are struggling and cannot afford the
 
01:00:13.260 --> 01:00:14.930 align:start position:0%
are struggling and cannot afford the
full

01:00:14.930 --> 01:00:14.940 align:start position:0%
full
 
01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:16.130 align:start position:0%
full
pocket

01:00:16.130 --> 01:00:16.140 align:start position:0%
pocket
 
01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
how many can you afford to service for
 
01:00:22.849 --> 01:00:22.859 align:start position:0%
free or reduced rates how many families
 
01:00:25.250 --> 01:00:25.260 align:start position:0%
would you estimate get turned away from
 
01:00:28.250 --> 01:00:28.260 align:start position:0%
music therapy I honestly can't can't
 
01:00:31.010 --> 01:00:31.020 align:start position:0%
answer that I can tell you when I was
 
01:00:33.890 --> 01:00:33.900 align:start position:0%
working for assisted living facilities I
 
01:00:35.690 --> 01:00:35.700 align:start position:0%
was and when I was doing groups I would
 
01:00:38.030 --> 01:00:38.040 align:start position:0%
offer a sliding scale but of course that
 
01:00:40.130 --> 01:00:40.140 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day that harms what
 
01:00:41.450 --> 01:00:41.460 align:start position:0%
I'm taking home
 
01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
and what I'm able to do I I would love
 
01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:46.319 align:start position:0%
to have service everyone for free I'm
 
01:00:49.309 --> 01:00:49.319 align:start position:0%
sure like any doctor would we love to
 
01:00:50.690 --> 01:00:50.700 align:start position:0%
give this service away for free we're
 
01:00:53.210 --> 01:00:53.220 align:start position:0%
passionate about what we do but
 
01:00:55.549 --> 01:00:55.559 align:start position:0%
um I I don't know the exact numbers and
 
01:00:56.690 --> 01:00:56.700 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that many of these other
 
01:00:58.970 --> 01:00:58.980 align:start position:0%
therapists might have a more accurate
 
01:01:01.010 --> 01:01:01.020 align:start position:0%
answer to that thank you
 
01:01:03.349 --> 01:01:03.359 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
01:01:05.329 --> 01:01:05.339 align:start position:0%

01:02:15.710 --> 01:02:15.720 align:start position:0%
your question sir
 
01:02:17.870 --> 01:02:17.880 align:start position:0%
music therapists are evidence-based prac
 
01:02:20.030 --> 01:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
use evidence-based practices to work
 
01:02:21.589 --> 01:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
toward each client-centered goal
 
01:02:23.270 --> 01:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
supported through a body of research
 
01:02:26.089 --> 01:02:26.099 align:start position:0%
spanning decades you may see your local
 
01:02:27.650 --> 01:02:27.660 align:start position:0%
music therapists working with a child
 
01:02:29.510 --> 01:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
with autism to develop expressive
 
01:02:31.430 --> 01:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
communication through techniques such as
 
01:02:34.130 --> 01:02:34.140 align:start position:0%
call and response singing or to motivate
 
01:02:35.630 --> 01:02:35.640 align:start position:0%
the child to finish a phrase in a

favorite song
 
01:02:38.930 --> 01:02:38.940 align:start position:0%
like our friend already said
 
01:02:41.150 --> 01:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
another music therapist may be working
 
01:02:43.130 --> 01:02:43.140 align:start position:0%
with a patient undergoing chemotherapy
 
01:02:45.170 --> 01:02:45.180 align:start position:0%
using music to decrease their perception
 
01:02:46.190 --> 01:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
of pain
 
01:02:49.970 --> 01:02:49.980 align:start position:0%
also researched and known
 
01:02:52.130 --> 01:02:52.140 align:start position:0%
or you may see me working with adults in
 
01:02:54.230 --> 01:02:54.240 align:start position:0%
recovery using the songwriting process
 
01:02:56.329 --> 01:02:56.339 align:start position:0%
as a means to process their experiences
 
01:02:58.849 --> 01:02:58.859 align:start position:0%
name their motivations for recovery and
 
01:03:01.069 --> 01:03:01.079 align:start position:0%
identify their strengths and resilience
 
01:03:03.410 --> 01:03:03.420 align:start position:0%
in a group of women
 
01:03:05.569 --> 01:03:05.579 align:start position:0%
working through their
 
01:03:07.069 --> 01:03:07.079 align:start position:0%
um through their recovery they've
 
01:03:08.930 --> 01:03:08.940 align:start position:0%
written a song with a lyrics
 
01:03:10.370 --> 01:03:10.380 align:start position:0%
of these
 
01:03:12.829 --> 01:03:12.839 align:start position:0%
I've constructed These Bricks as a wall
 
01:03:15.170 --> 01:03:15.180 align:start position:0%

01:03:17.410 --> 01:03:17.420 align:start position:0%

01:03:20.089 --> 01:03:20.099 align:start position:0%
dismantling my resistance to let the
 
01:03:22.970 --> 01:03:22.980 align:start position:0%
light come shining through
 
01:03:25.490 --> 01:03:25.500 align:start position:0%
the education training and certification
 
01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:27.480 align:start position:0%
of a music therapist is expansive and
 
01:03:29.630 --> 01:03:29.640 align:start position:0%
rigorous a music therapist must earn a
 
01:03:30.950 --> 01:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree or higher with a

seven of the 48 music therapists in the

less barriers

by creating a state license for music

01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
creating a state standard that is

01:09:49.269 --> 01:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions
 
01:09:53.269 --> 01:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:55.669 --> 01:09:55.679 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so in your
 
01:09:57.770 --> 01:09:57.780 align:start position:0%
testimony you alluded to something that
 
01:09:59.750 --> 01:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
has come up previously in this hearing
 
01:10:02.810 --> 01:10:02.820 align:start position:0%
namely that music could cause harm in
 
01:10:05.630 --> 01:10:05.640 align:start position:0%
the hands of somebody who's incompetent
 
01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
or untrained is it not the case that
 
01:10:12.010 --> 01:10:12.020 align:start position:0%
harm can come to people who encounter
 
01:10:14.930 --> 01:10:14.940 align:start position:0%
doctors nurses
 
01:10:18.890 --> 01:10:18.900 align:start position:0%
um teachers you name the profession if
 
01:10:21.970 --> 01:10:21.980 align:start position:0%
they are unqualified untrained
 
01:10:25.930 --> 01:10:25.940 align:start position:0%
incompetent mentally ill or whatever
 
01:10:30.649 --> 01:10:30.659 align:start position:0%
just as is is the possibility in the
 
01:10:32.570 --> 01:10:32.580 align:start position:0%
hands of untrained people using music
 
01:10:32.580 --> 01:10:33.770 align:start position:0%
hands of untrained people using music
therapy

01:10:33.770 --> 01:10:33.780 align:start position:0%
therapy
 
01:10:37.370 --> 01:10:37.380 align:start position:0%
yes so just like any provider in the
 
01:10:39.709 --> 01:10:39.719 align:start position:0%
state there's always a risk for harm and
 
01:10:41.649 --> 01:10:41.659 align:start position:0%
that's what liability insurance is for
 
01:10:45.910 --> 01:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
however at current in our current system
 
01:10:48.610 --> 01:10:48.620 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
01:10:52.310 --> 01:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
constituents have no way to say that
 
01:10:55.250 --> 01:10:55.260 align:start position:0%
this is a licensed profession the way
 
01:10:57.890 --> 01:10:57.900 align:start position:0%
that they can search out for doctors and
 
01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
nurses they know that there is a
 
01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
standard of practice that's upheld by
 
01:11:04.610 --> 01:11:04.620 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:11:07.430 --> 01:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
um so right now people can walk around
 
01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
and say I'm a music therapist and unless
 
01:11:12.350 --> 01:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
the unless the client knows to ask for
 
01:11:14.390 --> 01:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
their credentials they have no way of
 
01:11:16.130 --> 01:11:16.140 align:start position:0%
knowing whether or not that person is
 
01:11:17.750 --> 01:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
board certified whether or not that
 
01:11:19.430 --> 01:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
person is
 
01:11:21.530 --> 01:11:21.540 align:start position:0%
um able to provide the service that
 
01:11:22.970 --> 01:11:22.980 align:start position:0%
they're saying that they're able to
 
01:11:22.980 --> 01:11:24.110 align:start position:0%
they're saying that they're able to
provide

01:11:24.110 --> 01:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
provide
 
01:11:26.270 --> 01:11:26.280 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up
 
01:11:28.970 --> 01:11:28.980 align:start position:0%
but it's it's not the case that uh
 
01:11:31.149 --> 01:11:31.159 align:start position:0%
somebody who's a musician
 
01:11:36.890 --> 01:11:36.900 align:start position:0%
who would uh play his or her instrument
 
01:11:38.750 --> 01:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
um and think that that might be
 
01:11:40.910 --> 01:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
beneficial uh
 
01:11:44.810 --> 01:11:44.820 align:start position:0%
would be capable of doing harm to
 
01:11:47.870 --> 01:11:47.880 align:start position:0%
someone just as somebody who thinks
 
01:11:51.590 --> 01:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
they're a doctor or have medical skills
 
01:11:52.850 --> 01:11:52.860 align:start position:0%
or whatever
 
01:11:57.110 --> 01:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
it the training that you alluded to is
 
01:11:59.229 --> 01:11:59.239 align:start position:0%
the underlying
 
01:12:01.729 --> 01:12:01.739 align:start position:0%
guarantor if you will that's the a
 
01:12:04.030 --> 01:12:04.040 align:start position:0%
person has some kind of competence
 
01:12:07.669 --> 01:12:07.679 align:start position:0%
precisely and if you've noticed I'm sure
 
01:12:09.590 --> 01:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
that you are all on the internet in some
 
01:12:11.270 --> 01:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
kind of way people love to use the
 
01:12:14.030 --> 01:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
phrase this like some blank fill in the
 
01:12:16.970 --> 01:12:16.980 align:start position:0%
blank is my therapy and a lot of times
 
01:12:19.430 --> 01:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
people use creative arts as their
 
01:12:21.229 --> 01:12:21.239 align:start position:0%
therapy and creative arts are
 
01:12:22.790 --> 01:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
therapeutic there's so many good things
 
01:12:25.189 --> 01:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
about that expression however it's very
 
01:12:27.050 --> 01:12:27.060 align:start position:0%
easy for a musician to come in and be
 
01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
like yes like music is therapeutic I'm
 
01:12:32.090 --> 01:12:32.100 align:start position:0%
definitely music therapy but they have
 
01:12:35.149 --> 01:12:35.159 align:start position:0%
no training or clinical practice the way
 
01:12:36.649 --> 01:12:36.659 align:start position:0%
that music therapists who are board
 
01:12:38.689 --> 01:12:38.699 align:start position:0%
certified do and that's the big
 
01:12:38.699 --> 01:12:39.709 align:start position:0%
certified do and that's the big
difference

01:12:39.709 --> 01:12:39.719 align:start position:0%
difference
 
01:12:41.450 --> 01:12:41.460 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you other questions
 
01:12:41.460 --> 01:12:43.669 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you other questions
representative

01:12:43.669 --> 01:12:43.679 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:12:46.910 --> 01:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
um yeah so you said that uh people would
 
01:12:48.410 --> 01:12:48.420 align:start position:0%
know to check and see if they're
 
01:12:50.810 --> 01:12:50.820 align:start position:0%
licensed but they might not know to ask
 
01:12:53.270 --> 01:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
about certification I don't know see
 
01:12:54.770 --> 01:12:54.780 align:start position:0%
that I don't know that I see the
 
01:12:56.390 --> 01:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
difference couldn't they
 
01:12:58.250 --> 01:12:58.260 align:start position:0%
you know maybe get the word out that
 
01:13:00.530 --> 01:13:00.540 align:start position:0%
people can ask for certification if
 
01:13:02.630 --> 01:13:02.640 align:start position:0%
that's something they they are proof of
 
01:13:04.189 --> 01:13:04.199 align:start position:0%
certification if that's something they
 
01:13:06.350 --> 01:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
care about rather than dealing with this
 
01:13:08.630 --> 01:13:08.640 align:start position:0%
with licensing I understand the payment
 
01:13:10.850 --> 01:13:10.860 align:start position:0%
issue but on that point if you could
 
01:13:10.860 --> 01:13:13.610 align:start position:0%
issue but on that point if you could
comment

01:13:13.610 --> 01:13:13.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:15.470 --> 01:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
if people want to ask for credentials
 
01:13:16.490 --> 01:13:16.500 align:start position:0%
they're going to ask for credentials
 
01:13:19.850 --> 01:13:19.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:23.030 --> 01:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
I mean whether it's asking for licensing
 
01:13:25.310 --> 01:13:25.320 align:start position:0%
or asking for if they have some
 
01:13:28.729 --> 01:13:28.739 align:start position:0%
certification sure so there's definitely
 
01:13:30.410 --> 01:13:30.420 align:start position:0%
the part of like educating the public
 
01:13:31.790 --> 01:13:31.800 align:start position:0%
about what we do and what our
 
01:13:34.250 --> 01:13:34.260 align:start position:0%
qualifications are however I think it is
 
01:13:36.229 --> 01:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
the duty of the state to protect its
 
01:13:38.390 --> 01:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
constituents and by licensing that's
 
01:13:40.010 --> 01:13:40.020 align:start position:0%
what that does
 
01:13:42.229 --> 01:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
thank you other representative
 
01:13:44.810 --> 01:13:44.820 align:start position:0%
representative Simon thank you madam
 
01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:45.830 align:start position:0%
representative Simon thank you madam
chair

01:13:45.830 --> 01:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:46.430 align:start position:0%
chair
um

01:13:46.430 --> 01:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:47.870 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:13:47.870 --> 01:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:13:50.450 --> 01:13:50.460 align:start position:0%
just a question as far as this question
 
01:13:53.810 --> 01:13:53.820 align:start position:0%
about doing harm is concerned music is a
 
01:13:56.330 --> 01:13:56.340 align:start position:0%
pretty universally used thing it's loved
 
01:13:57.890 --> 01:13:57.900 align:start position:0%
by all of us we all listen to it we all
 
01:13:58.970 --> 01:13:58.980 align:start position:0%
use it
 
01:13:59.990 --> 01:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
um when you're talking about somebody
 
01:14:02.450 --> 01:14:02.460 align:start position:0%
who's practicing without proper
 
01:14:05.270 --> 01:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
certification and if we were obviously
 
01:14:07.070 --> 01:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
to give you licensure and the ability to
 
01:14:08.390 --> 01:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
separate people who are licensed from
 
01:14:10.130 --> 01:14:10.140 align:start position:0%
people who are not
 
01:14:11.930 --> 01:14:11.940 align:start position:0%
um where does the where's the boundary
 
01:14:13.729 --> 01:14:13.739 align:start position:0%
line in that as far as people using
 
01:14:15.950 --> 01:14:15.960 align:start position:0%
music would music have to be the primary
 
01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:17.149 align:start position:0%
music would music have to be the primary
thing

01:14:17.149 --> 01:14:17.159 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:14:18.830 --> 01:14:18.840 align:start position:0%
um that an unlicensed person would be
 
01:14:21.050 --> 01:14:21.060 align:start position:0%
using in their therapy sessions or for
 
01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
example if somebody just happened to be
 
01:14:25.010 --> 01:14:25.020 align:start position:0%
using music while doing some other form
 
01:14:26.870 --> 01:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
of therapy would there be accountability
 
01:14:28.610 --> 01:14:28.620 align:start position:0%
for me it's just kind of it's a little
 
01:14:30.290 --> 01:14:30.300 align:start position:0%
cloudy at the moment New Concept for me
 
01:14:32.810 --> 01:14:32.820 align:start position:0%
granted but where that line gets drawn
 
01:14:35.149 --> 01:14:35.159 align:start position:0%
so the land gets drawn at the definition
 
01:14:38.030 --> 01:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
of music therapy so people so for
 
01:14:40.130 --> 01:14:40.140 align:start position:0%
example let's say a talk therapist is is
 
01:14:43.370 --> 01:14:43.380 align:start position:0%
using music in their session to explore
 
01:14:45.470 --> 01:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
something with their client that client
 
01:14:48.830 --> 01:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
that therapist isn't saying that they're
 
01:14:50.270 --> 01:14:50.280 align:start position:0%
doing music therapy in that moment
 
01:14:52.490 --> 01:14:52.500 align:start position:0%
they're using music in
 
01:14:54.550 --> 01:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
um they're already licensed profession
 
01:14:58.330 --> 01:14:58.340 align:start position:0%
uh the line comes when
 
01:15:01.250 --> 01:15:01.260 align:start position:0%
unqualified I guess
 
01:15:04.070 --> 01:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
unqualified people are using
 
01:15:07.970 --> 01:15:07.980 align:start position:0%
you okay hang on let me restart I'm glad
 
01:15:09.770 --> 01:15:09.780 align:start position:0%
no I'm glad it wasn't an easy thing to
 
01:15:10.910 --> 01:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
answer because I'm a little confused
 
01:15:13.790 --> 01:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
myself yeah so
 
01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
let me start with the definition of
 
01:15:16.910 --> 01:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
music therapy the definition of music
 
01:15:19.330 --> 01:15:19.340 align:start position:0%
therapy is using music to address
 
01:15:22.669 --> 01:15:22.679 align:start position:0%
non-musical goals so using music to
 
01:15:25.189 --> 01:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
promote cognition promote
 
01:15:26.450 --> 01:15:26.460 align:start position:0%
um expressive and receptive
 
01:15:29.149 --> 01:15:29.159 align:start position:0%
communication to develop physical motor
 
01:15:31.970 --> 01:15:31.980 align:start position:0%
movements right so the music itself is
 
01:15:34.729 --> 01:15:34.739 align:start position:0%
the facilitating factor of that growth
 
01:15:38.450 --> 01:15:38.460 align:start position:0%
for that person so music therapists are
 
01:15:40.790 --> 01:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
the ones who know how the music affects
 
01:15:44.689 --> 01:15:44.699 align:start position:0%
that growth in that specific area
 
01:15:46.790 --> 01:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't say that people can't use
 
01:15:48.229 --> 01:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
music in different therapeutic
 
01:15:49.669 --> 01:15:49.679 align:start position:0%
environments that's not what we're
 
01:15:51.830 --> 01:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
saying but we're saying the body of
 
01:15:54.229 --> 01:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
knowledge of knowing how music affects
 
01:15:57.169 --> 01:15:57.179 align:start position:0%
those growth areas is specialized and is
 
01:15:59.450 --> 01:15:59.460 align:start position:0%
important to identify
 
01:16:01.490 --> 01:16:01.500 align:start position:0%
um so that's the difference is knowing
 
01:16:04.729 --> 01:16:04.739 align:start position:0%
how the music affects that specific area
 
01:16:06.770 --> 01:16:06.780 align:start position:0%
of growth for that person or that goal
 
01:16:08.930 --> 01:16:08.940 align:start position:0%
area for that person
 
01:16:11.330 --> 01:16:11.340 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up
 
01:16:13.430 --> 01:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
um so just as by way of example and once
 
01:16:15.530 --> 01:16:15.540 align:start position:0%
again if it's it's fine if you aren't
 
01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the question
 
01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:18.770 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the question
um

01:16:18.770 --> 01:16:18.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:22.310 --> 01:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
a psychologist is meeting with a patient
 
01:16:24.110 --> 01:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
turns on some music in the background
 
01:16:25.850 --> 01:16:25.860 align:start position:0%
that the psychologist feels like will be
 
01:16:29.570 --> 01:16:29.580 align:start position:0%
soothing and then the client complains
 
01:16:31.370 --> 01:16:31.380 align:start position:0%
that the music actually was harmful in
 
01:16:32.810 --> 01:16:32.820 align:start position:0%
some way
 
01:16:34.430 --> 01:16:34.440 align:start position:0%
um obviously if you're licensed you
 
01:16:35.750 --> 01:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
would then have an oversight Board of
 
01:16:37.189 --> 01:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
some sort
 
01:16:39.110 --> 01:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
um would that be a lit from your
 
01:16:40.610 --> 01:16:40.620 align:start position:0%
perspective would that be a legitimate
 
01:16:41.990 --> 01:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
complaint would the board have something
 
01:16:44.270 --> 01:16:44.280 align:start position:0%
to say about that or not because it's
 
01:16:47.090 --> 01:16:47.100 align:start position:0%
not technically a music therapist that's
 
01:16:49.970 --> 01:16:49.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:51.290 --> 01:16:51.300 align:start position:0%
the board have something to say about
 
01:16:51.300 --> 01:16:52.310 align:start position:0%
the board have something to say about
that

01:16:52.310 --> 01:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:16:55.430 --> 01:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
um only if they're like only if they're
 
01:16:57.229 --> 01:16:57.239 align:start position:0%
saying that they're doing music therapy
 
01:16:58.729 --> 01:16:58.739 align:start position:0%
in their session and they don't have the
 
01:17:00.530 --> 01:17:00.540 align:start position:0%
music therapy licensure we're not
 
01:17:02.270 --> 01:17:02.280 align:start position:0%
cornering the market on using music
 
01:17:04.189 --> 01:17:04.199 align:start position:0%
therapeutically music can be used
 
01:17:05.390 --> 01:17:05.400 align:start position:0%
therapeutically in a lot of different
 
01:17:07.610 --> 01:17:07.620 align:start position:0%
settings just like many other techniques
 
01:17:11.570 --> 01:17:11.580 align:start position:0%
are used across many Allied professions
 
01:17:14.450 --> 01:17:14.460 align:start position:0%
um no one's cornering the market on on
 
01:17:17.990 --> 01:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
the use of music but we are trying to
 
01:17:19.970 --> 01:17:19.980 align:start position:0%
specify the language of what music
 
01:17:22.790 --> 01:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
therapy is and so that people understand
 
01:17:25.430 --> 01:17:25.440 align:start position:0%
what they are what they are getting and
 
01:17:27.050 --> 01:17:27.060 align:start position:0%
when they're getting it yeah thank you
 
01:17:29.510 --> 01:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
so much appreciate it
 
01:17:31.850 --> 01:17:31.860 align:start position:0%
representative true
 
01:17:33.530 --> 01:17:33.540 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
01:17:35.630 --> 01:17:35.640 align:start position:0%
taking my question ma'am
 
01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:36.649 align:start position:0%
taking my question ma'am
um

01:17:36.649 --> 01:17:36.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:39.709 --> 01:17:39.719 align:start position:0%
I believe you said that you uh in a
 
01:17:41.689 --> 01:17:41.699 align:start position:0%
facility that was seven other
 
01:17:45.890 --> 01:17:45.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:48.169 --> 01:17:48.179 align:start position:0%
how do you you get paid
 
01:17:50.990 --> 01:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
not from insurance companies correct
 
01:17:53.330 --> 01:17:53.340 align:start position:0%
it's all private pay so people can
 
01:17:56.330 --> 01:17:56.340 align:start position:0%
either pay out of pocket sometimes we
 
01:17:57.890 --> 01:17:57.900 align:start position:0%
partner with different facilities to
 
01:17:59.810 --> 01:17:59.820 align:start position:0%
offer scholarships for services we have
 
01:18:03.169 --> 01:18:03.179 align:start position:0%
a sliding scale fee based on income and
 
01:18:06.470 --> 01:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
we also help clients in certain
 
01:18:08.630 --> 01:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
facilities who qualify to apply for
 
01:18:10.669 --> 01:18:10.679 align:start position:0%
grant funding
 
01:18:13.790 --> 01:18:13.800 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you madam chair
 
01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:14.750 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you madam chair
um

01:18:14.750 --> 01:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:18.189 --> 01:18:18.199 align:start position:0%
so if a person were
 
01:18:22.130 --> 01:18:22.140 align:start position:0%
referred by a a doctor a physician or a
 
01:18:25.490 --> 01:18:25.500 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist or a psychologist
 
01:18:28.310 --> 01:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
to receive music therapy
 
01:18:31.310 --> 01:18:31.320 align:start position:0%
would that qualify for insurance no
 
01:18:34.010 --> 01:18:34.020 align:start position:0%
because we're not licensed so insurance
 
01:18:36.290 --> 01:18:36.300 align:start position:0%
companies give a blanket statement that
 
01:18:37.729 --> 01:18:37.739 align:start position:0%
unless you can provide a license number
 
01:18:39.890 --> 01:18:39.900 align:start position:0%
they will not engage with you and the
 
01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
same goes for Medicaid
 
01:18:43.430 --> 01:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:18:45.890 --> 01:18:45.900 align:start position:0%
yes thank you representative Gerhard
 
01:18:47.689 --> 01:18:47.699 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair are you familiar
 
01:18:50.030 --> 01:18:50.040 align:start position:0%
do you with the NH music therapy task
 
01:18:52.550 --> 01:18:52.560 align:start position:0%
force correct okay so on the one flyer
 
01:18:53.750 --> 01:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
talking about Education and Training
 
01:18:55.370 --> 01:18:55.380 align:start position:0%
says bachelor's degree or higher
 
01:18:57.770 --> 01:18:57.780 align:start position:0%
required and 1200 Plus hours on-site
 
01:19:01.010 --> 01:19:01.020 align:start position:0%
clinical training internship is this the
 
01:19:03.169 --> 01:19:03.179 align:start position:0%
current requirements to be board
 
01:19:04.970 --> 01:19:04.980 align:start position:0%
certified correct
 
01:19:04.980 --> 01:19:06.350 align:start position:0%
certified correct
so

01:19:06.350 --> 01:19:06.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:19:09.229 --> 01:19:09.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:11.570 --> 01:19:11.580 align:start position:0%
wouldn't such stringent standards
 
01:19:13.550 --> 01:19:13.560 align:start position:0%
decrease the availability of care for
 
01:19:16.550 --> 01:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
people that they have to meet these my
 
01:19:18.649 --> 01:19:18.659 align:start position:0%
point being is if music therapy is is
 
01:19:20.330 --> 01:19:20.340 align:start position:0%
good for as many people as we can get to
 
01:19:21.770 --> 01:19:21.780 align:start position:0%
it there's going to be different sliding
 
01:19:23.030 --> 01:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
scales of people that are capable and
 
01:19:24.830 --> 01:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
what they can do with it so I'm just
 
01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:26.209 align:start position:0%
what they can do with it so I'm just
wondering

01:19:26.209 --> 01:19:26.219 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
01:19:29.810 --> 01:19:29.820 align:start position:0%
is this High bar necessary to get these
 
01:19:32.450 --> 01:19:32.460 align:start position:0%
Services out to people who need them yes
 
01:19:32.460 --> 01:19:34.610 align:start position:0%
Services out to people who need them yes
so

01:19:34.610 --> 01:19:34.620 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:19:38.990 --> 01:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
we to be working therapeutically with
 
01:19:40.729 --> 01:19:40.739 align:start position:0%
clients you have to have
 
01:19:43.610 --> 01:19:43.620 align:start position:0%
at minimum a bachelor's education in
 
01:19:46.550 --> 01:19:46.560 align:start position:0%
each of those areas I outlined in human
 
01:19:49.030 --> 01:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
development in cognition to understand
 
01:19:53.149 --> 01:19:53.159 align:start position:0%
that the frequency of so like one of the
 
01:19:55.370 --> 01:19:55.380 align:start position:0%
one of the really interesting things is
 
01:19:57.709 --> 01:19:57.719 align:start position:0%
how music affects the brain and our
 
01:20:00.890 --> 01:20:00.900 align:start position:0%
respiratory system so the pace and the
 
01:20:03.050 --> 01:20:03.060 align:start position:0%
frequency of the music affects our heart
 
01:20:05.149 --> 01:20:05.159 align:start position:0%
rate affects our perspiration affects
 
01:20:08.270 --> 01:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
our breathing pattern and a high school
 
01:20:10.729 --> 01:20:10.739 align:start position:0%
graduate does not know that like a high
 
01:20:17.169 --> 01:20:17.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:20.030 --> 01:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
I do thank you madam chair
 
01:20:22.490 --> 01:20:22.500 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question my
 
01:20:24.530 --> 01:20:24.540 align:start position:0%
question has to do with um the
 
01:20:26.750 --> 01:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
scholarships you mentioned and the
 
01:20:29.810 --> 01:20:29.820 align:start position:0%
sliding scale so as a businesswoman
 
01:20:29.820 --> 01:20:30.890 align:start position:0%
sliding scale so as a businesswoman
um

01:20:30.890 --> 01:20:30.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:35.090 --> 01:20:35.100 align:start position:0%
can you tell us like is there a limit to
 
01:20:37.610 --> 01:20:37.620 align:start position:0%
the number of scholarships and sliding
 
01:20:40.910 --> 01:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
scales or can you service all
 
01:20:44.149 --> 01:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
um families who request the service but
 
01:20:46.370 --> 01:20:46.380 align:start position:0%
but don't have the out-of-pocket money
 
01:20:49.729 --> 01:20:49.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:51.470 --> 01:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
are you essentially asking are people
 
01:20:54.590 --> 01:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
turned away because they cannot pay
 
01:20:58.669 --> 01:20:58.679 align:start position:0%
um okay so we do as for our and I'll let
 
01:21:00.470 --> 01:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
Marissa is going to testify later she's
 
01:21:01.850 --> 01:21:01.860 align:start position:0%
our business owner and she'll be able to
 
01:21:03.950 --> 01:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
answer this much more thoroughly however
 
01:21:06.350 --> 01:21:06.360 align:start position:0%
I'll say that we do our everything in
 
01:21:08.450 --> 01:21:08.460 align:start position:0%
our power to not turn away clients
 
01:21:10.970 --> 01:21:10.980 align:start position:0%
however there are a number of clients
 
01:21:12.709 --> 01:21:12.719 align:start position:0%
who have stopped Services because they
 
01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
have become unaffordable so we do
 
01:21:17.630 --> 01:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
everything we can however we do believe
 
01:21:19.250 --> 01:21:19.260 align:start position:0%
because it's a part of Health Care that
 
01:21:21.770 --> 01:21:21.780 align:start position:0%
it should be covered by Health Care
 
01:21:24.890 --> 01:21:24.900 align:start position:0%
absolutely yes insurance is not Health
 
01:21:27.110 --> 01:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
Care by the way
 
01:21:30.470 --> 01:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you anyone else
 
01:21:33.290 --> 01:21:33.300 align:start position:0%
representative thank you um just wanted
 
01:21:34.970 --> 01:21:34.980 align:start position:0%
to mention uh for you and everyone that
 
01:21:36.350 --> 01:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
this is going to subcommittee I was
 
01:21:39.110 --> 01:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could be available
 
01:21:41.570 --> 01:21:41.580 align:start position:0%
um you know to to help with that as well
 
01:21:46.070 --> 01:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:48.290 --> 01:21:48.300 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for Testimony
 
01:21:54.169 --> 01:21:54.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:54.179 --> 01:21:59.030 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:21:59.030 --> 01:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:02.450 --> 01:22:02.460 align:start position:0%
good morning honorable Representatives
 
01:22:05.090 --> 01:22:05.100 align:start position:0%
my name is Michael King and I'm a
 
01:22:09.350 --> 01:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:11.750 --> 01:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
I'm here today to ask you to vote in
 
01:22:13.970 --> 01:22:13.980 align:start position:0%
favor of music therapy
 
01:22:16.070 --> 01:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
licensure bill
 
01:22:17.930 --> 01:22:17.940 align:start position:0%
as you know veterans face many
 
01:22:21.470 --> 01:22:21.480 align:start position:0%
challenges excuse me
 
01:22:23.570 --> 01:22:23.580 align:start position:0%
upon their challenges Upon returning
 
01:22:25.189 --> 01:22:25.199 align:start position:0%
home and lots of different types of
 
01:22:26.870 --> 01:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
therapy are offered
 
01:22:29.149 --> 01:22:29.159 align:start position:0%
but one of the most powerful therapies
 
01:22:31.430 --> 01:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
isn't available to most veterans because
 
01:22:33.590 --> 01:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
without licensure the insurance
 
01:22:35.810 --> 01:22:35.820 align:start position:0%
companies won't cover it and most people
 
01:22:38.630 --> 01:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
including myself can afford to pay out
 
01:22:39.890 --> 01:22:39.900 align:start position:0%
of pocket
 
01:22:41.810 --> 01:22:41.820 align:start position:0%
I have always had a strong connection to
 
01:22:43.790 --> 01:22:43.800 align:start position:0%
music and my daughters who are both
 
01:22:46.610 --> 01:22:46.620 align:start position:0%
musicians would sing some carefully
 
01:22:48.850 --> 01:22:48.860 align:start position:0%
chosen songs at the veterans ceremonies
 
01:22:52.130 --> 01:22:52.140 align:start position:0%
most times everyone was in tears because
 
01:22:53.930 --> 01:22:53.940 align:start position:0%
they were sharing the common emotion
 
01:22:56.450 --> 01:22:56.460 align:start position:0%
that came through the music
 
01:22:58.850 --> 01:22:58.860 align:start position:0%
it bonded these people together and
 
01:23:00.530 --> 01:23:00.540 align:start position:0%
helped them to express some very
 
01:23:02.870 --> 01:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
powerful emotions they probably wouldn't
 
01:23:05.630 --> 01:23:05.640 align:start position:0%
be able to express otherwise and that
 
01:23:07.310 --> 01:23:07.320 align:start position:0%
was just from two girls singing
 
01:23:09.050 --> 01:23:09.060 align:start position:0%
patriotic songs
 
01:23:11.810 --> 01:23:11.820 align:start position:0%
the Patriotic music the practice of
 
01:23:13.850 --> 01:23:13.860 align:start position:0%
music therapy is much more intentional
 
01:23:16.550 --> 01:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
in its evaluation and treatment when
 
01:23:18.890 --> 01:23:18.900 align:start position:0%
working with clients I think we all
 
01:23:20.870 --> 01:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
allow the transformational power of
 
01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:22.189 align:start position:0%
allow the transformational power of
music

01:23:22.189 --> 01:23:22.199 align:start position:0%
music
 
01:23:24.530 --> 01:23:24.540 align:start position:0%
and the benefits of music therapy should
 
01:23:26.689 --> 01:23:26.699 align:start position:0%
be available to everyone so please vote
 
01:23:29.870 --> 01:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
in favor of licensure for music therapy
 
01:23:31.430 --> 01:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:23:35.450 --> 01:23:35.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr King are there questions
 
01:23:37.550 --> 01:23:37.560 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none thanks
 
01:23:39.229 --> 01:23:39.239 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:23:50.229 --> 01:23:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:53.570 --> 01:23:53.580 align:start position:0%
good morning Madam chairwoman and
 
01:23:56.090 --> 01:23:56.100 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I want to keep
 
01:23:57.830 --> 01:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
this very brief for you I know you've
 
01:24:00.290 --> 01:24:00.300 align:start position:0%
heard a lot of testimony today
 
01:24:02.810 --> 01:24:02.820 align:start position:0%
um I am a board certified music
 
01:24:07.669 --> 01:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
therapist and I support HB 532 I am also
 
01:24:10.149 --> 01:24:10.159 align:start position:0%
a business owner as has been mentioned
 
01:24:13.910 --> 01:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
and we serve about 3 000 individuals in
 
01:24:16.130 --> 01:24:16.140 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire per year
 
01:24:18.110 --> 01:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
um the piece that I really want to drive
 
01:24:20.090 --> 01:24:20.100 align:start position:0%
home today is
 
01:24:21.470 --> 01:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
um that I know you keep hearing about is
 
01:24:23.689 --> 01:24:23.699 align:start position:0%
really the insurance piece and as a
 
01:24:27.649 --> 01:24:27.659 align:start position:0%
business owner I turn people away
 
01:24:29.270 --> 01:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
um not necessarily turning people away
 
01:24:30.950 --> 01:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
but um
 
01:24:33.169 --> 01:24:33.179 align:start position:0%
I answer the question no we do not
 
01:24:34.669 --> 01:24:34.679 align:start position:0%
accept your insurance
 
01:24:37.790 --> 01:24:37.800 align:start position:0%
you know 20 to 40 times a month
 
01:24:40.910 --> 01:24:40.920 align:start position:0%
um and I'm constantly telling people I'm
 
01:24:42.890 --> 01:24:42.900 align:start position:0%
really sorry here are some other options
 
01:24:45.950 --> 01:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
and I've done everything that I can to
 
01:24:48.550 --> 01:24:48.560 align:start position:0%
help people get more access to services
 
01:24:52.610 --> 01:24:52.620 align:start position:0%
like we have a sliding fee and we have a
 
01:24:54.649 --> 01:24:54.659 align:start position:0%
scholarship program we've partnered with
 
01:24:57.290 --> 01:24:57.300 align:start position:0%
our local hospital who provides some
 
01:24:59.930 --> 01:24:59.940 align:start position:0%
Services I get just somebody had
 
01:25:02.450 --> 01:25:02.460 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier about doctor referrals
 
01:25:06.350 --> 01:25:06.360 align:start position:0%
I get from Dover Pediatrics referrals
 
01:25:08.630 --> 01:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
from Dover Pediatrics come in probably
 
01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:09.649 align:start position:0%
from Dover Pediatrics come in probably
like

01:25:09.649 --> 01:25:09.659 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:25:12.649 --> 01:25:12.659 align:start position:0%
you know 10 to 15 referrals from the
 
01:25:15.350 --> 01:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
doctors for their plate patients because
 
01:25:17.930 --> 01:25:17.940 align:start position:0%
they're hoping that this referral and
 
01:25:21.530 --> 01:25:21.540 align:start position:0%
can be used for us and we people can try
 
01:25:24.770 --> 01:25:24.780 align:start position:0%
to get out of network
 
01:25:26.450 --> 01:25:26.460 align:start position:0%
you know reimbursement for services
 
01:25:28.310 --> 01:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
because we have to be out of network
 
01:25:31.130 --> 01:25:31.140 align:start position:0%
providers but they can't
 
01:25:33.470 --> 01:25:33.480 align:start position:0%
um there's very limited success most
 
01:25:34.790 --> 01:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
people don't have a lot of outer Network
 
01:25:37.610 --> 01:25:37.620 align:start position:0%
benefits so
 
01:25:40.610 --> 01:25:40.620 align:start position:0%
um I've included for you today a direct
 
01:25:44.630 --> 01:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
email conversation between myself and a
 
01:25:46.250 --> 01:25:46.260 align:start position:0%
provider enrollment specialist with
 
01:25:49.669 --> 01:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
Medicaid directly denying my provider
 
01:25:49.679 --> 01:25:51.290 align:start position:0%
Medicaid directly denying my provider
application

01:25:51.290 --> 01:25:51.300 align:start position:0%
application
 
01:25:53.510 --> 01:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
um due to lack of licensure I hear the
 
01:25:54.470 --> 01:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
same thing from private insurance
 
01:25:57.590 --> 01:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
companies so we can't tell these
 
01:25:59.750 --> 01:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
families you can have Services
 
01:26:02.510 --> 01:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
um and that really takes away from their
 
01:26:05.450 --> 01:26:05.460 align:start position:0%
independent Choice people should be able
 
01:26:07.669 --> 01:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
to choose their doctor they should be
 
01:26:09.830 --> 01:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
able to choose their therapist they
 
01:26:12.410 --> 01:26:12.420 align:start position:0%
should be able to choose what type of
 
01:26:13.910 --> 01:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
um you know what type of school they
 
01:26:15.590 --> 01:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
want to go to
 
01:26:16.970 --> 01:26:16.980 align:start position:0%
um it everybody is a little bit
 
01:26:18.110 --> 01:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
different we all have different
 
01:26:20.810 --> 01:26:20.820 align:start position:0%
preferences and the right uh you know
 
01:26:22.669 --> 01:26:22.679 align:start position:0%
there's no one therapy that's the right
 
01:26:25.550 --> 01:26:25.560 align:start position:0%
fit for every single person in New
 
01:26:29.090 --> 01:26:29.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and right now this licensure
 
01:26:31.550 --> 01:26:31.560 align:start position:0%
not being able it's just a barrier they
 
01:26:33.169 --> 01:26:33.179 align:start position:0%
can't it's not even an option for people
 
01:26:35.930 --> 01:26:35.940 align:start position:0%
who are you know utilizing Medicaid it's
 
01:26:38.090 --> 01:26:38.100 align:start position:0%
not it's not an option for them so they
 
01:26:41.030 --> 01:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
don't have that choice and by removing
 
01:26:43.610 --> 01:26:43.620 align:start position:0%
this it doesn't make you the governing
 
01:26:45.110 --> 01:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
board of you know whether or not
 
01:26:47.149 --> 01:26:47.159 align:start position:0%
Medicaid is going to reimburse or not
 
01:26:48.649 --> 01:26:48.659 align:start position:0%
that's still
 
01:26:50.149 --> 01:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
that's going to be based on medical
 
01:26:52.790 --> 01:26:52.800 align:start position:0%
necessity but it removes the barrier so
 
01:26:54.530 --> 01:26:54.540 align:start position:0%
that they at least have the option to be
 
01:26:57.350 --> 01:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
assessed to see if it is medically
 
01:26:59.270 --> 01:26:59.280 align:start position:0%
necessary because right now that's not
 
01:27:02.030 --> 01:27:02.040 align:start position:0%
an option so I urge you to vote in
 
01:27:04.010 --> 01:27:04.020 align:start position:0%
support of this
 
01:27:05.030 --> 01:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
um bill
 
01:27:08.930 --> 01:27:08.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:11.209 --> 01:27:11.219 align:start position:0%
thank you I think we've exhausted our
 
01:27:13.010 --> 01:27:13.020 align:start position:0%
questions on the previous testifier
 
01:27:15.770 --> 01:27:15.780 align:start position:0%

House Bill 507 and call Representative
 
01:28:03.530 --> 01:28:03.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:03.540 --> 01:28:06.110 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:28:06.110 --> 01:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:13.010 --> 01:28:13.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:14.530 --> 01:28:14.540 align:start position:0%
at least you want the government
 
01:28:19.729 --> 01:28:19.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:21.910 --> 01:28:21.920 align:start position:0%
not clear which is
 
01:28:38.390 --> 01:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:38.400 --> 01:29:06.129 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:29:06.129 --> 01:29:06.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:08.629 --> 01:29:08.639 align:start position:0%
okay uh thank you ma'am chair and
 
01:29:10.250 --> 01:29:10.260 align:start position:0%
members of the committee representative
 
01:29:12.830 --> 01:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
Santa nastasso representing Rindge
 
01:29:14.570 --> 01:29:14.580 align:start position:0%
Jaffrey in Dublin
 
01:29:16.610 --> 01:29:16.620 align:start position:0%
uh so I'm going to be introducing House
 
01:29:20.209 --> 01:29:20.219 align:start position:0%
Bill uh 507 uh this bill removes the
 
01:29:22.189 --> 01:29:22.199 align:start position:0%
penalty for operating without an
 
01:29:24.950 --> 01:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
occupational license as long as they do
 
01:29:27.050 --> 01:29:27.060 align:start position:0%
not hold themselves out to be licensed
 
01:29:28.310 --> 01:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
by the state
 
01:29:32.390 --> 01:29:32.400 align:start position:0%
uh so this kind of change would make our
 
01:29:34.729 --> 01:29:34.739 align:start position:0%
licensing uh voluntary instead of
 
01:29:38.570 --> 01:29:38.580 align:start position:0%
compulsory and this kind of regime is uh
 
01:29:40.850 --> 01:29:40.860 align:start position:0%
better for this uh it's a better policy
 
01:29:44.510 --> 01:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
to make licensing uh better serve Public
 
01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:46.669 align:start position:0%
to make licensing uh better serve Public
Safety

01:29:46.669 --> 01:29:46.679 align:start position:0%
Safety
 
01:29:49.430 --> 01:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
um and and this is true because when you
 
01:29:51.709 --> 01:29:51.719 align:start position:0%
have anything compulsory uh like
 
01:29:54.290 --> 01:29:54.300 align:start position:0%
compulsory licensing it creates this uh
 
01:29:56.990 --> 01:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
us for stem sort of mentality where
 
01:29:58.610 --> 01:29:58.620 align:start position:0%
people are just gradually getting this
 
01:30:01.129 --> 01:30:01.139 align:start position:0%
license because the state just mandates
 
01:30:04.669 --> 01:30:04.679 align:start position:0%
it so and that's that's come becomes the
 
01:30:07.250 --> 01:30:07.260 align:start position:0%
culture in the in the attitude towards
 
01:30:09.290 --> 01:30:09.300 align:start position:0%
these licenses is that we're just doing
 
01:30:12.050 --> 01:30:12.060 align:start position:0%
this because you know the state makes us
 
01:30:16.070 --> 01:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
do it but uh it's not particularly uh
 
01:30:18.770 --> 01:30:18.780 align:start position:0%
beneficial for Public Safety or even or
 
01:30:21.530 --> 01:30:21.540 align:start position:0%
if there's even a point for it
 
01:30:23.990 --> 01:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
um involuntary licensing regimes uh the
 
01:30:26.030 --> 01:30:26.040 align:start position:0%
licensees and people who could
 
01:30:28.669 --> 01:30:28.679 align:start position:0%
potentially get licensed are going to be
 
01:30:31.070 --> 01:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
more likely to follow the guidelines and
 
01:30:34.850 --> 01:30:34.860 align:start position:0%
actually consider uh the cultural safety
 
01:30:37.490 --> 01:30:37.500 align:start position:0%
that uh the licensing regimes uh
 
01:30:37.500 --> 01:30:39.950 align:start position:0%
that uh the licensing regimes uh
therefore

01:30:39.950 --> 01:30:39.960 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:40.970 align:start position:0%
therefore
um

01:30:40.970 --> 01:30:40.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:44.030 --> 01:30:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:46.310 --> 01:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
so and yeah government has a tendency to
 
01:30:48.530 --> 01:30:48.540 align:start position:0%
kind of fight the last war so a lot of
 
01:30:51.530 --> 01:30:51.540 align:start position:0%
times when they make rules and it's for
 
01:30:52.970 --> 01:30:52.980 align:start position:0%
things that have already happened and
 
01:30:55.010 --> 01:30:55.020 align:start position:0%
not uh forward-looking things that could
 
01:30:57.830 --> 01:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
be going on right now that are unsafe
 
01:31:00.770 --> 01:31:00.780 align:start position:0%
uh so just a couple of antidotes just uh
 
01:31:02.930 --> 01:31:02.940 align:start position:0%
I have I just have a lot of licenses I'm
 
01:31:05.390 --> 01:31:05.400 align:start position:0%
a truck driver I'm used to be EMT I've
 
01:31:06.649 --> 01:31:06.659 align:start position:0%
got licenses all sorts of different
 
01:31:08.930 --> 01:31:08.940 align:start position:0%
things uh but I have a couple of
 
01:31:11.330 --> 01:31:11.340 align:start position:0%
examples where these two same industry
 
01:31:13.070 --> 01:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
same people in it
 
01:31:15.350 --> 01:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
um helicopter uh flight instructor
 
01:31:17.149 --> 01:31:17.159 align:start position:0%
certified by the FAA
 
01:31:19.430 --> 01:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
and it's totally clear in the general
 
01:31:22.790 --> 01:31:22.800 align:start position:0%
aviation world uh that is just contempt
 
01:31:25.610 --> 01:31:25.620 align:start position:0%
for the FAA nobody reports anything to
 
01:31:28.129 --> 01:31:28.139 align:start position:0%
the FAA violations of the fars Federal
 
01:31:30.350 --> 01:31:30.360 align:start position:0%
Aviation regulations go completely
 
01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:31.790 align:start position:0%
Aviation regulations go completely
unreported

01:31:31.790 --> 01:31:31.800 align:start position:0%
unreported
 
01:31:31.800 --> 01:31:32.450 align:start position:0%
unreported
um

01:31:32.450 --> 01:31:32.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:35.030 --> 01:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
you all the time you see things unsafe
 
01:31:37.610 --> 01:31:37.620 align:start position:0%
going on nobody brings it up you know
 
01:31:40.189 --> 01:31:40.199 align:start position:0%
maybe in private to the uh the pilot but
 
01:31:42.169 --> 01:31:42.179 align:start position:0%
uh they don't No One's Gonna report to
 
01:31:47.330 --> 01:31:47.340 align:start position:0%
the FAA uh on December 1st 1974 uh trans
 
01:31:50.990 --> 01:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
World Airlines flight 514 uh crashed
 
01:31:53.390 --> 01:31:53.400 align:start position:0%
into a mountain uh all 92 people aboard
 
01:31:55.070 --> 01:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
were killed
 
01:31:57.530 --> 01:31:57.540 align:start position:0%
um and the accident was caused by a
 
01:32:00.470 --> 01:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding between uh air traffic
 
01:32:03.050 --> 01:32:03.060 align:start position:0%
control and the pilots so the pilots
 
01:32:05.090 --> 01:32:05.100 align:start position:0%
thought they were on
 
01:32:07.010 --> 01:32:07.020 align:start position:0%
um they were being radar vectored when
 
01:32:10.010 --> 01:32:10.020 align:start position:0%
in fact they were not uh and what was
 
01:32:12.229 --> 01:32:12.239 align:start position:0%
interesting about this crash is the same
 
01:32:14.270 --> 01:32:14.280 align:start position:0%
accent almost happened six weeks prior
 
01:32:16.189 --> 01:32:16.199 align:start position:0%
and everybody knew about this problem
 
01:32:19.970 --> 01:32:19.980 align:start position:0%
except the FAA uh and then after the
 
01:32:21.890 --> 01:32:21.900 align:start position:0%
accident they implemented a system
 
01:32:24.610 --> 01:32:24.620 align:start position:0%
called the NASA uh Reporting System
 
01:32:27.830 --> 01:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
where Pilots can uh mechanics to and
 
01:32:30.709 --> 01:32:30.719 align:start position:0%
everybody can send a form to NASA where
 
01:32:32.870 --> 01:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
NASA will actually tear the name off
 
01:32:35.450 --> 01:32:35.460 align:start position:0%
uh and then send that to the fa so they
 
01:32:37.310 --> 01:32:37.320 align:start position:0%
could get some information of the field
 
01:32:40.669 --> 01:32:40.679 align:start position:0%
to this to the FAA uh and even that
 
01:32:43.550 --> 01:32:43.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't work nobody no one uses it uh
 
01:32:45.590 --> 01:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
even with the incentives built in so if
 
01:32:47.090 --> 01:32:47.100 align:start position:0%
you fill out a NASA form and then later
 
01:32:48.709 --> 01:32:48.719 align:start position:0%
you're being investigated for what you
 
01:32:50.990 --> 01:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
filled it out for uh they'll actually
 
01:32:52.610 --> 01:32:52.620 align:start position:0%
it's like a get out of jail free card
 
01:32:54.950 --> 01:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
but no one fills out because they don't
 
01:32:56.810 --> 01:32:56.820 align:start position:0%
trust the FAA
 
01:32:59.270 --> 01:32:59.280 align:start position:0%
and I just want to contrast this to uh
 
01:33:02.330 --> 01:33:02.340 align:start position:0%
sport parachuting so a lot of the same
 
01:33:04.070 --> 01:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
people are involved in sport parachuting
 
01:33:05.450 --> 01:33:05.460 align:start position:0%
I'm a
 
01:33:07.430 --> 01:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
United States parachute Association B
 
01:33:10.189 --> 01:33:10.199 align:start position:0%
license holder uh but skydiving is
 
01:33:12.890 --> 01:33:12.900 align:start position:0%
unregulated by the federal government uh
 
01:33:15.770 --> 01:33:15.780 align:start position:0%
so instead USPA popped up it's a private
 
01:33:17.930 --> 01:33:17.940 align:start position:0%
uh voluntary licensing regime that
 
01:33:20.689 --> 01:33:20.699 align:start position:0%
issues four levels of licenses uh levels
 
01:33:23.689 --> 01:33:23.699 align:start position:0%
a b and c and d and endorsements like
 
01:33:26.810 --> 01:33:26.820 align:start position:0%
coach instructor uh tandem jumper stuff
 
01:33:30.169 --> 01:33:30.179 align:start position:0%
like this so USPA produces the basic
 
01:33:33.229 --> 01:33:33.239 align:start position:0%
safety rules uh they you know every year
 
01:33:36.050 --> 01:33:36.060 align:start position:0%
they they publish it and
 
01:33:36.060 --> 01:33:36.590 align:start position:0%
they they publish it and
um

01:33:36.590 --> 01:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:38.450 --> 01:33:38.460 align:start position:0%
where I've never seen anyone's pickup
 
01:33:40.370 --> 01:33:40.380 align:start position:0%
truck with an FAA sticker on the back of
 
01:33:43.430 --> 01:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
it you know people love the USPA they
 
01:33:45.530 --> 01:33:45.540 align:start position:0%
follow and respect the rules
 
01:33:47.209 --> 01:33:47.219 align:start position:0%
um it's active with the members it gets
 
01:33:48.649 --> 01:33:48.659 align:start position:0%
immediate input to what's happening in
 
01:33:50.629 --> 01:33:50.639 align:start position:0%
the field so they're forward-looking
 
01:33:52.310 --> 01:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
they can make changes to the basic
 
01:33:53.810 --> 01:33:53.820 align:start position:0%
safety rules for accidents that haven't
 
01:33:55.970 --> 01:33:55.980 align:start position:0%
already happened
 
01:33:58.729 --> 01:33:58.739 align:start position:0%
um and they do all sorts of things like
 
01:34:01.250 --> 01:34:01.260 align:start position:0%
published magazine and uh they're just
 
01:34:04.370 --> 01:34:04.380 align:start position:0%
more connected with the members uh
 
01:34:07.729 --> 01:34:07.739 align:start position:0%
so most Drop Zones are regulated by USP
 
01:34:10.850 --> 01:34:10.860 align:start position:0%
but some are not but the licensees of
 
01:34:12.590 --> 01:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
USPA if they jump on those none
 
01:34:15.290 --> 01:34:15.300 align:start position:0%
regulated Drop Zones they still will
 
01:34:16.669 --> 01:34:16.679 align:start position:0%
follow the basic safety rules because
 
01:34:19.129 --> 01:34:19.139 align:start position:0%
they need to maintain their license uh
 
01:34:22.910 --> 01:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
so with voluntary licensing uh the truth
 
01:34:24.830 --> 01:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
is in New Hampshire right now there's
 
01:34:26.629 --> 01:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
people that are practicing these
 
01:34:29.689 --> 01:34:29.699 align:start position:0%
licensed professions unlicensed uh and
 
01:34:30.890 --> 01:34:30.900 align:start position:0%
they're going to continue to do so
 
01:34:34.550 --> 01:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
whether it's compulsory or not but uh
 
01:34:36.950 --> 01:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
this kind of voluntary system is going
 
01:34:40.370 --> 01:34:40.380 align:start position:0%
to be uh it's going to be better to
 
01:34:42.830 --> 01:34:42.840 align:start position:0%
serve needs of the public
 
01:34:45.950 --> 01:34:45.960 align:start position:0%
um so with that I'll take any questions
 
01:34:48.290 --> 01:34:48.300 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:34:50.450 --> 01:34:50.460 align:start position:0%
Gerhart yeah
 
01:34:52.729 --> 01:34:52.739 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh I do have a
 
01:34:52.739 --> 01:34:54.169 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh I do have a
couple

01:34:54.169 --> 01:34:54.179 align:start position:0%
couple
 
01:34:57.830 --> 01:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh do you see any bleed over from this
 
01:34:59.750 --> 01:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
now you mentioned in your examples the
 
01:35:03.649 --> 01:35:03.659 align:start position:0%
FAA parachute jumping and uh everything
 
01:35:06.110 --> 01:35:06.120 align:start position:0%
else like that but one of the licensed
 
01:35:08.270 --> 01:35:08.280 align:start position:0%
things that's out there is let's pick
 
01:35:10.250 --> 01:35:10.260 align:start position:0%
something that's practical everybody has
 
01:35:13.490 --> 01:35:13.500 align:start position:0%
to call one and that's electrician he
 
01:35:17.090 --> 01:35:17.100 align:start position:0%
meets a license standard he is liable if
 
01:35:19.209 --> 01:35:19.219 align:start position:0%
the house catches fire because of that
 
01:35:22.370 --> 01:35:22.380 align:start position:0%
actually he works off a book that is
 
01:35:24.950 --> 01:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
supported by the national uh National
 
01:35:27.470 --> 01:35:27.480 align:start position:0%
Fire Protection Association that's who
 
01:35:30.290 --> 01:35:30.300 align:start position:0%
writes the fire code so to bleed over
 
01:35:33.169 --> 01:35:33.179 align:start position:0%
from what your bill is doing could
 
01:35:35.390 --> 01:35:35.400 align:start position:0%
affect let's say a licensed electrician
 
01:35:38.030 --> 01:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
coming in and working on a job is that
 
01:35:41.750 --> 01:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
correct uh that's correct uh so a
 
01:35:44.090 --> 01:35:44.100 align:start position:0%
licensed electrician uh
 
01:35:46.729 --> 01:35:46.739 align:start position:0%
the insurance companies typically almost
 
01:35:49.850 --> 01:35:49.860 align:start position:0%
universally will require that the work
 
01:35:52.310 --> 01:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
is done to code and it's done by a
 
01:35:55.370 --> 01:35:55.380 align:start position:0%
licensed electrician so what
 
01:35:57.770 --> 01:35:57.780 align:start position:0%
the thing is there's already unlicensed
 
01:35:59.930 --> 01:35:59.940 align:start position:0%
electricians working on buildings all
 
01:36:03.590 --> 01:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
the time it's very common making it this
 
01:36:05.930 --> 01:36:05.940 align:start position:0%
will not change
 
01:36:07.610 --> 01:36:07.620 align:start position:0%
whether or not you need a licensed
 
01:36:08.689 --> 01:36:08.699 align:start position:0%
electrician to meet insurance
 
01:36:11.149 --> 01:36:11.159 align:start position:0%
requirements unless it becomes the case
 
01:36:14.330 --> 01:36:14.340 align:start position:0%
where that the state is inadequate in
 
01:36:17.990 --> 01:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
providing safety and a private uh
 
01:36:20.930 --> 01:36:20.940 align:start position:0%
electrician licensing regime came up and
 
01:36:22.310 --> 01:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
then the insurance may switch to that or
 
01:36:24.830 --> 01:36:24.840 align:start position:0%
something like this so this will you
 
01:36:28.370 --> 01:36:28.380 align:start position:0%
know give uh the State Licensing regime
 
01:36:30.470 --> 01:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
some Market competition that way
 
01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:32.390 align:start position:0%
some Market competition that way
follow-up

01:36:32.390 --> 01:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:36:35.270 --> 01:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
are you aware
 
01:36:38.149 --> 01:36:38.159 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire falls uh the
 
01:36:40.129 --> 01:36:40.139 align:start position:0%
unwritten rule a man's home is his
 
01:36:40.139 --> 01:36:41.330 align:start position:0%
unwritten rule a man's home is his
castle

01:36:41.330 --> 01:36:41.340 align:start position:0%
castle
 
01:36:44.270 --> 01:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
so you are right that the homeowner
 
01:36:44.280 --> 01:36:45.350 align:start position:0%
so you are right that the homeowner
himself

01:36:45.350 --> 01:36:45.360 align:start position:0%
himself
 
01:36:48.350 --> 01:36:48.360 align:start position:0%
yeah but only if he lives in a single
 
01:36:50.930 --> 01:36:50.940 align:start position:0%
family home because what he does in the
 
01:36:53.629 --> 01:36:53.639 align:start position:0%
duplex can jeopardize the adjacent
 
01:36:55.910 --> 01:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
family that lives next door to him but
 
01:36:57.709 --> 01:36:57.719 align:start position:0%
in the single family resident the
 
01:37:00.110 --> 01:37:00.120 align:start position:0%
homeowner himself can do his own
 
01:37:03.169 --> 01:37:03.179 align:start position:0%
electrical work but that does not
 
01:37:03.179 --> 01:37:04.669 align:start position:0%
electrical work but that does not
ah

01:37:04.669 --> 01:37:04.679 align:start position:0%
ah
 
01:37:07.790 --> 01:37:07.800 align:start position:0%
he's not graced with any not filing a
 
01:37:10.270 --> 01:37:10.280 align:start position:0%
bro a building permit to which
 
01:37:12.290 --> 01:37:12.300 align:start position:0%
electrician would come down and
 
01:37:14.510 --> 01:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
electrical you know inspector come down
 
01:37:16.550 --> 01:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the work is safe and
 
01:37:18.770 --> 01:37:18.780 align:start position:0%
everything else like that so in a way
 
01:37:21.649 --> 01:37:21.659 align:start position:0%
are you aware that you know if you owned
 
01:37:24.350 --> 01:37:24.360 align:start position:0%
your own property it you are allowed to
 
01:37:28.250 --> 01:37:28.260 align:start position:0%
do that so it does exist in the state
 
01:37:32.510 --> 01:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
uh I I guess maybe I didn't articulate
 
01:37:34.129 --> 01:37:34.139 align:start position:0%
it well uh
 
01:37:36.410 --> 01:37:36.420 align:start position:0%
I'm saying that there is unlicensed
 
01:37:38.209 --> 01:37:38.219 align:start position:0%
electricians that work
 
01:37:41.870 --> 01:37:41.880 align:start position:0%
out without following the it's not

independent none under on uh under the

grace of a mass electrician's license uh
 
01:37:58.129 --> 01:37:58.139 align:start position:0%
that's correct
 
01:38:00.290 --> 01:38:00.300 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:38:03.229 --> 01:38:03.239 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chair
foreign

01:38:06.910 --> 01:38:06.920 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:38:09.530 --> 01:38:09.540 align:start position:0%
experience I thought the one of the most
 
01:38:10.790 --> 01:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
interesting things about the licensing
 
01:38:12.590 --> 01:38:12.600 align:start position:0%
regime as it goes so far as construction
 
01:38:15.050 --> 01:38:15.060 align:start position:0%
goes being a carpenter myself you can
 
01:38:17.390 --> 01:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
build a house without a license
 
01:38:18.649 --> 01:38:18.659 align:start position:0%
but you can't put the Electrical
 
01:38:21.110 --> 01:38:21.120 align:start position:0%
Plumbing or in New Hampshire even
 
01:38:23.870 --> 01:38:23.880 align:start position:0%
landscapers have to get licenses whereas
 
01:38:25.970 --> 01:38:25.980 align:start position:0%
even Massachusetts I was looking at this
 
01:38:27.610 --> 01:38:27.620 align:start position:0%
I saw it was interesting Massachusetts
 
01:38:30.709 --> 01:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island and Connecticut do not need
 
01:38:32.390 --> 01:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
license for
 
01:38:34.490 --> 01:38:34.500 align:start position:0%
commercial residential I mean I'm sorry
 
01:38:36.229 --> 01:38:36.239 align:start position:0%
that's for the commercial landscaping
 
01:38:37.910 --> 01:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
license but that's besides the point I
 
01:38:39.709 --> 01:38:39.719 align:start position:0%
was going to get it get at is the
 
01:38:41.750 --> 01:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
contractors I feel would not hire
 
01:38:43.250 --> 01:38:43.260 align:start position:0%
somebody that's incompetent because it
 
01:38:45.649 --> 01:38:45.659 align:start position:0%
falls on their insurance their bond so I
 
01:38:46.910 --> 01:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
have a million dollar Bond if I was
 
01:38:48.590 --> 01:38:48.600 align:start position:0%
going to build something I do not feel I
 
01:38:50.090 --> 01:38:50.100 align:start position:0%
would hire somebody that's a sketch ball
 
01:38:51.950 --> 01:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
because it falls on me I just wonder if
 
01:38:53.750 --> 01:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of other safeguards in
 
01:38:56.689 --> 01:38:56.699 align:start position:0%
place such as just Market forces besides
 
01:38:57.950 --> 01:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
the insurance aspect that would keep
 
01:38:59.629 --> 01:38:59.639 align:start position:0%
this from current do you agree
 
01:39:01.910 --> 01:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh yeah of course I agree with that but
 
01:39:04.129 --> 01:39:04.139 align:start position:0%
insurance is a big deal I mean if your
 
01:39:06.410 --> 01:39:06.420 align:start position:0%
building burns down and then they do an
 
01:39:08.270 --> 01:39:08.280 align:start position:0%
inspection and they find out that the
 
01:39:09.970 --> 01:39:09.980 align:start position:0%
wiring was done
 
01:39:12.890 --> 01:39:12.900 align:start position:0%
incorrectly it wasn't to code uh and
 
01:39:14.330 --> 01:39:14.340 align:start position:0%
it's required in your insurance that you
 
01:39:16.070 --> 01:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
would have it done to code and have it
 
01:39:17.689 --> 01:39:17.699 align:start position:0%
done by a licensed electrician then it's
 
01:39:19.910 --> 01:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
not going to pay out so
 
01:39:22.610 --> 01:39:22.620 align:start position:0%
with this change the the licensed
 
01:39:24.350 --> 01:39:24.360 align:start position:0%
electricians are likely to stay the same
 
01:39:26.330 --> 01:39:26.340 align:start position:0%
people will still want to get licensed
 
01:39:28.209 --> 01:39:28.219 align:start position:0%
by the state it gives them credibility
 
01:39:30.709 --> 01:39:30.719 align:start position:0%
uh and it and it helps them mandate
 
01:39:33.229 --> 01:39:33.239 align:start position:0%
their insurance it's just taking away
 
01:39:34.970 --> 01:39:34.980 align:start position:0%
the penalty for doing the work
 
01:39:34.980 --> 01:39:44.209 align:start position:0%
the penalty for doing the work
unlicensed

01:39:44.209 --> 01:39:44.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:47.689 --> 01:39:47.699 align:start position:0%
to draft this legislation thank you I
 
01:39:49.370 --> 01:39:49.380 align:start position:0%
was asked to put this Mill in by members
 
01:39:52.370 --> 01:39:52.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:58.550 --> 01:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:00.770 --> 01:40:00.780 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:40:00.780 --> 01:40:01.669 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
um

01:40:01.669 --> 01:40:01.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:04.490 --> 01:40:04.500 align:start position:0%
speaking to Insurance
 
01:40:04.500 --> 01:40:05.090 align:start position:0%
speaking to Insurance
um

01:40:05.090 --> 01:40:05.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:08.090 --> 01:40:08.100 align:start position:0%
we all know that it's important if you
 
01:40:10.669 --> 01:40:10.679 align:start position:0%
have someone doing construction work
 
01:40:13.850 --> 01:40:13.860 align:start position:0%
particularly at your home it's important
 
01:40:17.090 --> 01:40:17.100 align:start position:0%
to see if they have insurance so that in
 
01:40:20.390 --> 01:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
case the person performing the work is
 
01:40:24.370 --> 01:40:24.380 align:start position:0%
injured at your home they are covered
 
01:40:27.410 --> 01:40:27.420 align:start position:0%
how would this affect that do you not
 
01:40:30.590 --> 01:40:30.600 align:start position:0%
have to have a license in order to
 
01:40:33.530 --> 01:40:33.540 align:start position:0%
insure yourself if you're doing work in
 
01:40:35.930 --> 01:40:35.940 align:start position:0%
those instances
 
01:40:37.729 --> 01:40:37.739 align:start position:0%
uh yeah I believe it's correct that
 
01:40:40.729 --> 01:40:40.739 align:start position:0%
insurance mostly would require you to be
 
01:40:42.530 --> 01:40:42.540 align:start position:0%
licensed in order to do work and get and
 
01:40:45.890 --> 01:40:45.900 align:start position:0%
get bonds and and things like this uh so
 
01:40:48.350 --> 01:40:48.360 align:start position:0%
the licensing would still be there
 
01:40:50.090 --> 01:40:50.100 align:start position:0%
exactly the same way as it is right now
 
01:40:52.729 --> 01:40:52.739 align:start position:0%
and those contractors would get licensed
 
01:40:55.850 --> 01:40:55.860 align:start position:0%
I expect with this change the same
 
01:40:57.770 --> 01:40:57.780 align:start position:0%
amount of con the same it wouldn't
 
01:40:59.870 --> 01:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
change the distribution of unlicensed
 
01:41:02.270 --> 01:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
workers and licensed workers
 
01:41:06.169 --> 01:41:06.179 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you madam chair but uh
 
01:41:08.990 --> 01:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
if in fact you hire someone to do work
 
01:41:12.110 --> 01:41:12.120 align:start position:0%
at your home without taking the step to
 
01:41:15.129 --> 01:41:15.139 align:start position:0%
ask if they have that kind of insurance
 
01:41:18.110 --> 01:41:18.120 align:start position:0%
then if someone is injured doing that
 
01:41:20.810 --> 01:41:20.820 align:start position:0%
work that would fall to the homeowner to
 
01:41:24.050 --> 01:41:24.060 align:start position:0%
cover that I would be liable to suit I
 
01:41:26.890 --> 01:41:26.900 align:start position:0%
would yes and I think we're
 
01:41:29.990 --> 01:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
getting very speculative
 
01:41:33.770 --> 01:41:33.780 align:start position:0%
so yes the homeowner would would be
 
01:41:35.750 --> 01:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
required to have insurance to cover
 
01:41:37.850 --> 01:41:37.860 align:start position:0%
workers in their house
 
01:41:42.050 --> 01:41:42.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:45.290 --> 01:41:45.300 align:start position:0%
anybody else representative goalie
 
01:41:46.790 --> 01:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
01:41:48.410 --> 01:41:48.420 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:41:52.669 --> 01:41:52.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:56.149 --> 01:41:56.159 align:start position:0%
Plumbing electrical and all that but
 
01:41:58.609 --> 01:41:58.619 align:start position:0%
would this not also cover medical Fields
 
01:42:01.669 --> 01:42:01.679 align:start position:0%
such as nurse practitioners doctors I
 
01:42:03.350 --> 01:42:03.360 align:start position:0%
could say I'm a doctor or a pharmacist
 
01:42:05.810 --> 01:42:05.820 align:start position:0%
and as long as I don't say I'm licensed
 
01:42:08.510 --> 01:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
I can say I can go and practice medicine
 
01:42:10.910 --> 01:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
uh yes that would be correct you would
 
01:42:13.430 --> 01:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
be able to uh privately but just like
 
01:42:15.050 --> 01:42:15.060 align:start position:0%
with the electricians and stuff like
 
01:42:18.950 --> 01:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
this uh hospitals and insurance it's not
 
01:42:21.530 --> 01:42:21.540 align:start position:0%
gonna pay out you know and Hospital's
 
01:42:23.750 --> 01:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
not gonna staff people if unless the
 
01:42:25.850 --> 01:42:25.860 align:start position:0%
hospital you know in some other world
 
01:42:28.609 --> 01:42:28.619 align:start position:0%
didn't want licensed professionals uh
 
01:42:29.810 --> 01:42:29.820 align:start position:0%
they're still going to require that
 
01:42:31.310 --> 01:42:31.320 align:start position:0%
insurance is going to require it to pay
 
01:42:33.169 --> 01:42:33.179 align:start position:0%
out I mean we just had the music therapy
 
01:42:34.189 --> 01:42:34.199 align:start position:0%
bill with
 
01:42:36.410 --> 01:42:36.420 align:start position:0%
that's unlicensed and people are doing
 
01:42:38.390 --> 01:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
it and they're asking for license to
 
01:42:41.930 --> 01:42:41.940 align:start position:0%
fulfill insurance requirements uh so but
 
01:42:49.129 --> 01:42:49.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:52.629 --> 01:42:52.639 align:start position:0%
are you conflicting are you are you um
 
01:42:54.950 --> 01:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
misinterpreting or misunderstanding the
 
01:42:58.250 --> 01:42:58.260 align:start position:0%
difference between unlicensed and
 
01:42:58.260 --> 01:43:00.229 align:start position:0%
difference between unlicensed and
certified

01:43:00.229 --> 01:43:00.239 align:start position:0%
certified
 
01:43:02.510 --> 01:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
uh no I I don't believe so could you
 
01:43:02.520 --> 01:43:03.590 align:start position:0%
uh no I I don't believe so could you
elaborate

01:43:03.590 --> 01:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
elaborate
 
01:43:03.600 --> 01:43:04.910 align:start position:0%
elaborate
yes

01:43:04.910 --> 01:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:43:08.990 --> 01:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
a license thank you sorry follow up
 
01:43:10.550 --> 01:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
that's right you can't grant me the
 
01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:12.229 align:start position:0%
that's right you can't grant me the
follow-up

01:43:12.229 --> 01:43:12.239 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:43:16.370 --> 01:43:16.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:19.550 --> 01:43:19.560 align:start position:0%
so you're saying that not only if
 
01:43:21.470 --> 01:43:21.480 align:start position:0%
someone is so basically you're saying
 
01:43:24.169 --> 01:43:24.179 align:start position:0%
anyone can do anything as long as they
 
01:43:25.609 --> 01:43:25.619 align:start position:0%
are not
 
01:43:27.590 --> 01:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
as long as they tell people they're not
 
01:43:27.600 --> 01:43:29.209 align:start position:0%
as long as they tell people they're not
licensed

01:43:29.209 --> 01:43:29.219 align:start position:0%
licensed
 
01:43:31.550 --> 01:43:31.560 align:start position:0%
and you don't mention the word certified
 
01:43:34.550 --> 01:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
so people don't have to say can say that
 
01:43:37.189 --> 01:43:37.199 align:start position:0%
they're unlicensed to be a doctor but
 
01:43:39.229 --> 01:43:39.239 align:start position:0%
they can't say they don't have to say
 
01:43:41.570 --> 01:43:41.580 align:start position:0%
that they're not only non-licensed
 
01:43:44.209 --> 01:43:44.219 align:start position:0%
they're uncertified to be a doctor oh I
 
01:43:47.570 --> 01:43:47.580 align:start position:0%
understand uh what you're asking
 
01:43:47.580 --> 01:43:48.830 align:start position:0%
understand uh what you're asking
um so

01:43:48.830 --> 01:43:48.840 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:43:51.770 --> 01:43:51.780 align:start position:0%
the state would yeah the bill just says
 
01:43:54.050 --> 01:43:54.060 align:start position:0%
they can't hold themselves out to to say
 
01:43:56.030 --> 01:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
that they're licensed by the state so if
 
01:43:58.850 --> 01:43:58.860 align:start position:0%
they're certified uh or not certified
 
01:44:03.410 --> 01:44:03.420 align:start position:0%
the bill doesn't doesn't talk about that
 
01:44:05.870 --> 01:44:05.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:44:08.629 --> 01:44:08.639 align:start position:0%

01:44:27.410 --> 01:44:27.420 align:start position:0%
certification
 
01:44:29.870 --> 01:44:29.880 align:start position:0%
we have approximately it's always
 
01:44:32.629 --> 01:44:32.639 align:start position:0%
subject to change about 240 license
 
01:44:34.729 --> 01:44:34.739 align:start position:0%
types within the office
 
01:44:37.070 --> 01:44:37.080 align:start position:0%
and I do think there is always an
 
01:44:39.950 --> 01:44:39.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity for the general court to to
 
01:44:41.930 --> 01:44:41.940 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not licensure is
 
01:44:44.870 --> 01:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
truly necessary to protect the public
 
01:44:46.729 --> 01:44:46.739 align:start position:0%
but one thing that I think is absolutely
 
01:44:48.590 --> 01:44:48.600 align:start position:0%
certain is that
 
01:44:51.350 --> 01:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
the nature of voluntary licensure really
 
01:44:53.570 --> 01:44:53.580 align:start position:0%
contraves the whole purpose of licensure
 
01:44:56.330 --> 01:44:56.340 align:start position:0%
which is to protect the public that is
 
01:44:58.790 --> 01:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
the legislature has at some point made a
 
01:45:01.490 --> 01:45:01.500 align:start position:0%
determination that we shouldn't allow
 
01:45:04.609 --> 01:45:04.619 align:start position:0%
people to essentially consent to utilize
 
01:45:06.950 --> 01:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
Services by an individual certain
 
01:45:09.169 --> 01:45:09.179 align:start position:0%
Services by an individual who is not
 
01:45:09.179 --> 01:45:10.430 align:start position:0%
Services by an individual who is not
licensed

01:45:10.430 --> 01:45:10.440 align:start position:0%
licensed
 
01:45:12.470 --> 01:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
and I can tell you why that's important
 
01:45:15.169 --> 01:45:15.179 align:start position:0%
at least with certain fields
 
01:45:18.229 --> 01:45:18.239 align:start position:0%
if you are not a trained physician for
 
01:45:21.590 --> 01:45:21.600 align:start position:0%
example you are not going to know how to
 
01:45:24.350 --> 01:45:24.360 align:start position:0%
accurately convey the risks and the
 
01:45:28.010 --> 01:45:28.020 align:start position:0%
benefits uh to somebody that would
 
01:45:30.169 --> 01:45:30.179 align:start position:0%
effectively be informed consent who
 
01:45:32.330 --> 01:45:32.340 align:start position:0%
would utilize those services
 
01:45:35.629 --> 01:45:35.639 align:start position:0%
additionally we have had issues where
 
01:45:38.629 --> 01:45:38.639 align:start position:0%
it's not clear where people have crossed
 
01:45:41.510 --> 01:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
the lines unlicensed practice typically
 
01:45:44.750 --> 01:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
occurs when somebody who or at least
 
01:45:48.770 --> 01:45:48.780 align:start position:0%
that we find somebody who is licensed
 
01:45:50.750 --> 01:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
but yet they are practicing beyond the
 
01:45:53.990 --> 01:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
scope of their license for example a
 
01:45:56.030 --> 01:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
licensed nursing assistant we've talked
 
01:45:58.390 --> 01:45:58.400 align:start position:0%
about this with the med spa bill
 
01:46:01.850 --> 01:46:01.860 align:start position:0%
but they've we've had several issues
 
01:46:04.430 --> 01:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
where lnas have held themselves out as
 
01:46:07.370 --> 01:46:07.380 align:start position:0%
lnas which they are but have gone on to
 
01:46:10.010 --> 01:46:10.020 align:start position:0%
administer botox for example which is
 
01:46:12.649 --> 01:46:12.659 align:start position:0%
outside the scope of their practice
 
01:46:14.510 --> 01:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
so that is considered unlicensed
 
01:46:16.550 --> 01:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
practice but under those circumstances
 
01:46:18.709 --> 01:46:18.719 align:start position:0%
the LNA would not necessarily know
 
01:46:20.810 --> 01:46:20.820 align:start position:0%
that's outside the scope of their
 
01:46:23.270 --> 01:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
practice so what are we to do in those
 
01:46:23.280 --> 01:46:25.669 align:start position:0%
practice so what are we to do in those
circumstances

01:46:25.669 --> 01:46:25.679 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
01:46:28.129 --> 01:46:28.139 align:start position:0%
I think
 
01:46:30.709 --> 01:46:30.719 align:start position:0%
I think the bill really complains the
 
01:46:32.510 --> 01:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
issue of whether or not we should
 
01:46:34.910 --> 01:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
require licensure for certain Professor
 
01:46:38.530 --> 01:46:38.540 align:start position:0%
professions versus whether or not
 
01:46:40.910 --> 01:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
licensure should be voluntary in nature
 
01:46:42.770 --> 01:46:42.780 align:start position:0%
or is necessary to protect the public
 
01:46:45.050 --> 01:46:45.060 align:start position:0%
and I would submit the general court can
 
01:46:46.609 --> 01:46:46.619 align:start position:0%
certainly look at that issue but
 
01:46:50.270 --> 01:46:50.280 align:start position:0%
voluntary licensure really just defeats
 
01:46:53.330 --> 01:46:53.340 align:start position:0%
the purpose of licensure in general with
 
01:46:54.649 --> 01:46:54.659 align:start position:0%
that I'd be happy to answer any
 
01:46:54.659 --> 01:46:55.910 align:start position:0%
that I'd be happy to answer any
questions

01:46:55.910 --> 01:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:47:00.129 --> 01:47:00.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:02.930 --> 01:47:02.940 align:start position:0%
Gerhart thank you madam chair
 
01:47:06.050 --> 01:47:06.060 align:start position:0%
as far as freedom of Association goes do
 
01:47:07.550 --> 01:47:07.560 align:start position:0%
two people in your mind have the
 
01:47:10.070 --> 01:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to engage in a business
 
01:47:12.109 --> 01:47:12.119 align:start position:0%
transaction outside the realm of the
 
01:47:13.010 --> 01:47:13.020 align:start position:0%
state like for instance if somebody
 
01:47:15.229 --> 01:47:15.239 align:start position:0%
wants to say to me I can do a surgeon on
 
01:47:17.169 --> 01:47:17.179 align:start position:0%
my finger do you feel that that's
 
01:47:20.030 --> 01:47:20.040 align:start position:0%
provided they have capacity but you have
 
01:47:21.590 --> 01:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
to understand that certain laws are
 
01:47:22.910 --> 01:47:22.920 align:start position:0%
intended to protect people who don't
 
01:47:26.689 --> 01:47:26.699 align:start position:0%
have capacity such as children or El you
 
01:47:29.570 --> 01:47:29.580 align:start position:0%
know people who are who are who lack
 
01:47:31.550 --> 01:47:31.560 align:start position:0%
mental capacity
 
01:47:34.010 --> 01:47:34.020 align:start position:0%
um and the example earlier regarding the
 
01:47:35.870 --> 01:47:35.880 align:start position:0%
electrical work
 
01:47:35.880 --> 01:47:36.470 align:start position:0%
electrical work
um

01:47:36.470 --> 01:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:40.189 --> 01:47:40.199 align:start position:0%
people do hire unlicensed electricians
 
01:47:42.070 --> 01:47:42.080 align:start position:0%
quite frequently because it is cheaper
 
01:47:44.390 --> 01:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
most frequently it's undocumented
 
01:47:48.590 --> 01:47:48.600 align:start position:0%
workers who will Who are accepting work
 
01:47:50.689 --> 01:47:50.699 align:start position:0%
at a lower rate that's not within the
 
01:47:52.430 --> 01:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
union rate
 
01:47:54.290 --> 01:47:54.300 align:start position:0%
um and so
 
01:47:56.629 --> 01:47:56.639 align:start position:0%
um but they may or may not have the
 
01:47:59.510 --> 01:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate skills so as a building
 
01:48:03.410 --> 01:48:03.420 align:start position:0%
owner certainly with capacity you could
 
01:48:05.090 --> 01:48:05.100 align:start position:0%
contract and say I'm willing to accept
 
01:48:07.370 --> 01:48:07.380 align:start position:0%
the risks and the benefits but what
 
01:48:09.229 --> 01:48:09.239 align:start position:0%
about the child who's living in the unit
 
01:48:11.030 --> 01:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
in that building they don't have
 
01:48:13.669 --> 01:48:13.679 align:start position:0%
capacity and I think that that's what
 
01:48:17.030 --> 01:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
these laws are intended to address
 
01:48:19.970 --> 01:48:19.980 align:start position:0%
hello follow up please um
 
01:48:21.770 --> 01:48:21.780 align:start position:0%
I understand you're saying but in my
 
01:48:23.090 --> 01:48:23.100 align:start position:0%
mind the simple fact that people are
 
01:48:25.250 --> 01:48:25.260 align:start position:0%
willing to go out and skirt the rules in
 
01:48:26.930 --> 01:48:26.940 align:start position:0%
order to save money means that this
 
01:48:28.490 --> 01:48:28.500 align:start position:0%
service that's not being provided at an
 
01:48:30.649 --> 01:48:30.659 align:start position:0%
adequate price so I wonder if we're
 
01:48:32.750 --> 01:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
really saving children as you say in the
 
01:48:34.310 --> 01:48:34.320 align:start position:0%
in the grand scheme of things but that
 
01:48:35.870 --> 01:48:35.880 align:start position:0%
just makes turn
 
01:48:38.689 --> 01:48:38.699 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I could I can't share cases
 
01:48:41.030 --> 01:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
but we've had issues with
 
01:48:43.129 --> 01:48:43.139 align:start position:0%
um shoddy electrical work for example
 
01:48:48.470 --> 01:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:50.450 --> 01:48:50.460 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very much thank you for
 
01:48:51.590 --> 01:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
your time
 
01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:55.689 align:start position:0%
your time
foreign

01:48:55.689 --> 01:48:55.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:58.310 --> 01:48:58.320 align:start position:0%
thank you director for taking my
 
01:49:01.310 --> 01:49:01.320 align:start position:0%
question uh besides being licensed but
 
01:49:04.189 --> 01:49:04.199 align:start position:0%
this ensures that quality work if the
 
01:49:05.570 --> 01:49:05.580 align:start position:0%
person is working within the
 
01:49:08.750 --> 01:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
capabilities of his license and it has
 
01:49:10.850 --> 01:49:10.860 align:start position:0%
value to the structure that the person
 
01:49:13.010 --> 01:49:13.020 align:start position:0%
is working on in the case of the
 
01:49:15.530 --> 01:49:15.540 align:start position:0%
electrician so going in the future the
 
01:49:17.689 --> 01:49:17.699 align:start position:0%
house will be able to be free and clear
 
01:49:21.410 --> 01:49:21.420 align:start position:0%
as sales and other obligations everybody
 
01:49:24.169 --> 01:49:24.179 align:start position:0%
gets their home inspected before they
 
01:49:25.790 --> 01:49:25.800 align:start position:0%
sell it so
 
01:49:28.129 --> 01:49:28.139 align:start position:0%
yeah eliminating license could
 
01:49:31.430 --> 01:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
jeopardize futuristic future homeowners
 
01:49:34.189 --> 01:49:34.199 align:start position:0%
yes that's true licensure is intended to
 
01:49:36.290 --> 01:49:36.300 align:start position:0%
ensure somebody has satisfied the bare
 
01:49:37.910 --> 01:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
minimum requirements in order to protect
 
01:49:39.649 --> 01:49:39.659 align:start position:0%
the public
 
01:49:42.350 --> 01:49:42.360 align:start position:0%
representative Gould
 
01:49:44.330 --> 01:49:44.340 align:start position:0%
can you tell me if this applies to a
 
01:49:47.390 --> 01:49:47.400 align:start position:0%
homeowner doing their own work no not
 
01:49:49.010 --> 01:49:49.020 align:start position:0%
for electrical there is a statutory
 
01:49:52.570 --> 01:49:52.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:54.890 --> 01:49:54.900 align:start position:0%
representative issue it
 
01:49:57.290 --> 01:49:57.300 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:50:00.649 --> 01:50:00.659 align:start position:0%
um director Courtney the reason that
 
01:50:04.910 --> 01:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
most licensed practitioners of any field
 
01:50:07.629 --> 01:50:07.639 align:start position:0%
whether it be construction or medical
 
01:50:11.030 --> 01:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
charge more because they have invested
 
01:50:14.629 --> 01:50:14.639 align:start position:0%
time and money to achieve that level is
 
01:50:16.430 --> 01:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
that not true
 
01:50:19.010 --> 01:50:19.020 align:start position:0%
I think that's beyond my scope of
 
01:50:21.229 --> 01:50:21.239 align:start position:0%
expertise I think that's true as a
 
01:50:22.790 --> 01:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
licensed attorney
 
01:50:25.070 --> 01:50:25.080 align:start position:0%
um you know certainly I paid a lot of
 
01:50:26.570 --> 01:50:26.580 align:start position:0%
money to get my degree and we would
 
01:50:28.250 --> 01:50:28.260 align:start position:0%
expect to charge more than somebody who
 
01:50:30.290 --> 01:50:30.300 align:start position:0%
didn't go to law school but that you
 
01:50:31.550 --> 01:50:31.560 align:start position:0%
know I can't say that's true for other
 
01:50:31.560 --> 01:50:35.390 align:start position:0%
know I can't say that's true for other
professionals

01:50:35.390 --> 01:50:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:37.430 --> 01:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time okay very good
 
01:50:49.910 --> 01:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:51.890 --> 01:50:51.900 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you madam chair and
 
01:50:53.209 --> 01:50:53.219 align:start position:0%
committee members my name is Sarah
 
01:50:56.030 --> 01:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
Holland I am a licensed real estate
 
01:50:58.129 --> 01:50:58.139 align:start position:0%
broker and I'm here on behalf of the New
 
01:51:00.410 --> 01:51:00.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of Realtors in the
 
01:51:01.910 --> 01:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
capacity of Vice chair of their public
 
01:51:03.950 --> 01:51:03.960 align:start position:0%
policy committee
 
01:51:05.930 --> 01:51:05.940 align:start position:0%
um as executive director Courtney
 
01:51:08.990 --> 01:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned and affirmed licensure is to
 
01:51:11.270 --> 01:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
protect the consumer
 
01:51:14.450 --> 01:51:14.460 align:start position:0%
um when we get licensed as a real estate
 
01:51:18.290 --> 01:51:18.300 align:start position:0%
licensee we do bare minimum education so
 
01:51:20.570 --> 01:51:20.580 align:start position:0%
we all have a baseline of info in order
 
01:51:22.250 --> 01:51:22.260 align:start position:0%
to protect the public
 
01:51:24.950 --> 01:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
each year we spend countless hours to
 
01:51:26.510 --> 01:51:26.520 align:start position:0%
educate ourselves on the numerous
 
01:51:29.149 --> 01:51:29.159 align:start position:0%
changes and laws and regulations and
 
01:51:31.669 --> 01:51:31.679 align:start position:0%
these include local Municipal changes
 
01:51:34.790 --> 01:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
state changes regulatory changes in
 
01:51:36.649 --> 01:51:36.659 align:start position:0%
different professions that we tend to
 
01:51:38.090 --> 01:51:38.100 align:start position:0%
touch throughout a real estate
 
01:51:40.850 --> 01:51:40.860 align:start position:0%
transaction as well as Federal changes
 
01:51:44.090 --> 01:51:44.100 align:start position:0%
and this is to ensure that we guide our
 
01:51:46.729 --> 01:51:46.739 align:start position:0%
clients through the purchase purchase
 
01:51:49.189 --> 01:51:49.199 align:start position:0%
and sales process without harm and this
 
01:51:52.310 --> 01:51:52.320 align:start position:0%
is harm that they may otherwise enter
 
01:51:54.830 --> 01:51:54.840 align:start position:0%
simply by being unaware if they did not
 
01:51:56.990 --> 01:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
have us as licensees to guide them
 
01:51:58.790 --> 01:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
through that process yes there are
 
01:52:01.310 --> 01:52:01.320 align:start position:0%
exceptions in statute now for property
 
01:52:02.750 --> 01:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
owners to buy and sell their own
 
01:52:05.930 --> 01:52:05.940 align:start position:0%
property but if anyone is to assist them
 
01:52:08.510 --> 01:52:08.520 align:start position:0%
and to be financially compensated for
 
01:52:10.669 --> 01:52:10.679 align:start position:0%
that work then they do need to have a
 
01:52:10.679 --> 01:52:11.870 align:start position:0%
that work then they do need to have a
license

01:52:11.870 --> 01:52:11.880 align:start position:0%
license
 
01:52:14.689 --> 01:52:14.699 align:start position:0%
so some of those numerous laws and
 
01:52:17.870 --> 01:52:17.880 align:start position:0%
regulations have to do with septic sewer
 
01:52:20.750 --> 01:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
escrow landlord tenant laws mandated
 
01:52:24.530 --> 01:52:24.540 align:start position:0%
disclosures and notifications agency and
 
01:52:27.709 --> 01:52:27.719 align:start position:0%
more importantly fair housing which any
 
01:52:31.129 --> 01:52:31.139 align:start position:0%
basic slip up that we may have as humans
 
01:52:34.790 --> 01:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
in the process of engaging a buyer who
 
01:52:37.010 --> 01:52:37.020 align:start position:0%
may be interested in purchasing a home
 
01:52:40.129 --> 01:52:40.139 align:start position:0%
that we are selling has violations and
 
01:52:41.990 --> 01:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
fines of up to one hundred thousand
 
01:52:44.990 --> 01:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
dollars per offense an hour job and I'm
 
01:52:47.270 --> 01:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
also a licensed educator relative to
 
01:52:50.390 --> 01:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
real estate pre-licensing and we spend
 
01:52:53.209 --> 01:52:53.219 align:start position:0%
three entire classes talking about fair
 
01:52:57.290 --> 01:52:57.300 align:start position:0%
housing for our pre-license students so
 
01:52:59.270 --> 01:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
all of these laws and regulations are
 
01:53:01.250 --> 01:53:01.260 align:start position:0%
incredibly important and they are there
 
01:53:03.109 --> 01:53:03.119 align:start position:0%
to protect the consumer
 
01:53:05.390 --> 01:53:05.400 align:start position:0%
if we as licensees are being held
 
01:53:07.850 --> 01:53:07.860 align:start position:0%
accountable to know this information and
 
01:53:10.609 --> 01:53:10.619 align:start position:0%
to guide our clients appropriately
 
01:53:12.830 --> 01:53:12.840 align:start position:0%
stripping the ability to hold those
 
01:53:15.649 --> 01:53:15.659 align:start position:0%
accountable who are not licensed and
 
01:53:17.950 --> 01:53:17.960 align:start position:0%
hold those themselves out as
 
01:53:21.169 --> 01:53:21.179 align:start position:0%
practitioners who are just not licensed
 
01:53:24.290 --> 01:53:24.300 align:start position:0%
and can do this work contradicts is a
 
01:53:26.750 --> 01:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
contradiction to consumer protection
 
01:53:29.390 --> 01:53:29.400 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions thank you very
 
01:53:32.209 --> 01:53:32.219 align:start position:0%
much are there questions
 
01:53:34.550 --> 01:53:34.560 align:start position:0%
I don't see any very good
 
01:53:49.609 --> 01:53:49.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:53.209 --> 01:53:53.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:55.189 --> 01:53:55.199 align:start position:0%
to better turn your mic on and introduce
 
01:53:55.199 --> 01:53:59.709 align:start position:0%
to better turn your mic on and introduce
yourself

01:53:59.709 --> 01:53:59.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:02.510 --> 01:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
okay awesome my name is Ian Underwood I
 
01:54:04.970 --> 01:54:04.980 align:start position:0%
live in Croydon uh thank you for
 
01:54:07.550 --> 01:54:07.560 align:start position:0%
allowing me to testify I quickly want to
 
01:54:09.470 --> 01:54:09.480 align:start position:0%
bring up three things that have been
 
01:54:13.850 --> 01:54:13.860 align:start position:0%
raised the first is the idea that uh you
 
01:54:16.129 --> 01:54:16.139 align:start position:0%
can't have a license that isn't required
 
01:54:18.290 --> 01:54:18.300 align:start position:0%
I think a lot of you have one a PRL
 
01:54:20.990 --> 01:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
license this is a license it's called a
 
01:54:24.590 --> 01:54:24.600 align:start position:0%
license it is completely not mandatory I
 
01:54:26.030 --> 01:54:26.040 align:start position:0%
don't have to get one of these to carry
 
01:54:28.010 --> 01:54:28.020 align:start position:0%
a gun I don't have to get one of these
 
01:54:31.490 --> 01:54:31.500 align:start position:0%
to do anything but I can get one
 
01:54:34.010 --> 01:54:34.020 align:start position:0%
because it might make some people feel
 
01:54:35.870 --> 01:54:35.880 align:start position:0%
better about dealing with me in some
 
01:54:38.450 --> 01:54:38.460 align:start position:0%
situations which is so a voluntary
 
01:54:40.430 --> 01:54:40.440 align:start position:0%
license is already a thing
 
01:54:42.470 --> 01:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
01:54:44.149 --> 01:54:44.159 align:start position:0%
the second thing is
 
01:54:44.159 --> 01:54:44.990 align:start position:0%
the second thing is
um

01:54:44.990 --> 01:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:47.030 --> 01:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
this idea that just because somebody has
 
01:54:49.550 --> 01:54:49.560 align:start position:0%
a license that he is somehow
 
01:54:53.209 --> 01:54:53.219 align:start position:0%
capable or competent and there's a three
 
01:54:56.090 --> 01:54:56.100 align:start position:0%
word answer to that which is public
 
01:54:58.129 --> 01:54:58.139 align:start position:0%
school teachers
 
01:55:00.950 --> 01:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
they're licensed they're certified we
 
01:55:04.430 --> 01:55:04.440 align:start position:0%
have 40 literacy in our schools so the
 
01:55:05.810 --> 01:55:05.820 align:start position:0%
the idea that you have a license
 
01:55:08.270 --> 01:55:08.280 align:start position:0%
guarantees something I think is just a
 
01:55:11.390 --> 01:55:11.400 align:start position:0%
demonstrable fallacy the third thing is
 
01:55:12.709 --> 01:55:12.719 align:start position:0%
it's interesting to notice if you look
 
01:55:15.350 --> 01:55:15.360 align:start position:0%
at the sign up sheets it's never people
 
01:55:18.050 --> 01:55:18.060 align:start position:0%
who it's never the consumers the
 
01:55:20.570 --> 01:55:20.580 align:start position:0%
customers who come in and say protect me
 
01:55:21.890 --> 01:55:21.900 align:start position:0%
from these people who don't know what
 
01:55:23.510 --> 01:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
they're doing it's always the people who
 
01:55:26.330 --> 01:55:26.340 align:start position:0%
are already have the licenses or have
 
01:55:29.090 --> 01:55:29.100 align:start position:0%
some kind of certification or
 
01:55:31.729 --> 01:55:31.739 align:start position:0%
uh have have jumped over some hurdles
 
01:55:33.350 --> 01:55:33.360 align:start position:0%
who are trying to turn around and say
 
01:55:35.870 --> 01:55:35.880 align:start position:0%
nobody else should be able to compete
 
01:55:36.830 --> 01:55:36.840 align:start position:0%
with me
 
01:55:39.169 --> 01:55:39.179 align:start position:0%
unless they also jump over this hurdle
 
01:55:40.609 --> 01:55:40.619 align:start position:0%
so it makes it a kind of fraternity
 
01:55:40.619 --> 01:55:42.290 align:start position:0%
so it makes it a kind of fraternity
hazing

01:55:42.290 --> 01:55:42.300 align:start position:0%
hazing
 
01:55:44.570 --> 01:55:44.580 align:start position:0%
um I do have a longer version of my
 
01:55:46.250 --> 01:55:46.260 align:start position:0%
written testimony which I will provide
 
01:55:48.609 --> 01:55:48.619 align:start position:0%
and I also have I've written a book
 
01:55:52.189 --> 01:55:52.199 align:start position:0%
about this very topic which explains why
 
01:55:54.169 --> 01:55:54.179 align:start position:0%
voluntary licensing is really the way to
 
01:55:56.209 --> 01:55:56.219 align:start position:0%
go especially New Hampshire I have
 
01:55:58.729 --> 01:55:58.739 align:start position:0%
copies for anybody who wants one you can
 
01:56:01.189 --> 01:56:01.199 align:start position:0%
have one for free today
 
01:56:01.199 --> 01:56:01.729 align:start position:0%
have one for free today
um

01:56:01.729 --> 01:56:01.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:03.770 --> 01:56:03.780 align:start position:0%
so briefly there are five reasons to
 
01:56:05.990 --> 01:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
support this bill economic political
 
01:56:09.350 --> 01:56:09.360 align:start position:0%
cultural constitutional and traditional
 
01:56:11.510 --> 01:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
the economic reason is that apart from
 
01:56:14.050 --> 01:56:14.060 align:start position:0%
creating a monopolistic price structure
 
01:56:16.250 --> 01:56:16.260 align:start position:0%
licensing prevents people from offering
 
01:56:19.070 --> 01:56:19.080 align:start position:0%
specialized and Innovative services and
 
01:56:20.750 --> 01:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
prevents customers from benefiting from
 
01:56:22.550 --> 01:56:22.560 align:start position:0%
those services and we're all poorer for
 
01:56:25.609 --> 01:56:25.619 align:start position:0%
that in terms of money and ideas
 
01:56:27.590 --> 01:56:27.600 align:start position:0%
there's a political reason as we've
 
01:56:29.810 --> 01:56:29.820 align:start position:0%
recently seen in the last few years
 
01:56:31.790 --> 01:56:31.800 align:start position:0%
threatening to pull the licenses of
 
01:56:31.800 --> 01:56:32.689 align:start position:0%
threatening to pull the licenses of
people

01:56:32.689 --> 01:56:32.699 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:56:35.030 --> 01:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
to render them unable to feed and house
 
01:56:37.790 --> 01:56:37.800 align:start position:0%
themselves to make a living is a primary
 
01:56:40.189 --> 01:56:40.199 align:start position:0%
tool now that governments use to crush
 
01:56:42.290 --> 01:56:42.300 align:start position:0%
opposition to official policies whether
 
01:56:44.689 --> 01:56:44.699 align:start position:0%
misguided or not and even to get people
 
01:56:46.729 --> 01:56:46.739 align:start position:0%
to stop having certain kinds of of
 
01:56:49.790 --> 01:56:49.800 align:start position:0%
conversations in California right now if
 
01:56:51.169 --> 01:56:51.179 align:start position:0%
you disagree with the governor about
 
01:56:53.990 --> 01:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
covid you can have your license pulled
 
01:56:56.030 --> 01:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
there's a cultural reason as everybody
 
01:56:58.550 --> 01:56:58.560 align:start position:0%
knows and I I'm sure all of you know
 
01:57:01.790 --> 01:57:01.800 align:start position:0%
Pollux politics is Downstream of culture
 
01:57:03.890 --> 01:57:03.900 align:start position:0%
people get the government that they
 
01:57:05.209 --> 01:57:05.219 align:start position:0%
understand that they want that they
 
01:57:05.219 --> 01:57:06.350 align:start position:0%
understand that they want that they
deserve

01:57:06.350 --> 01:57:06.360 align:start position:0%
deserve
 
01:57:08.689 --> 01:57:08.699 align:start position:0%
and if you live in a place where you
 
01:57:11.270 --> 01:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
literally have to ask permission to make
 
01:57:12.589 --> 01:57:12.599 align:start position:0%
a living
 
01:57:15.350 --> 01:57:15.360 align:start position:0%
that actually undermines culturally the
 
01:57:17.930 --> 01:57:17.940 align:start position:0%
experience of Freedom that's necessary
 
01:57:19.609 --> 01:57:19.619 align:start position:0%
to sustain the idea of freedom
 
01:57:21.470 --> 01:57:21.480 align:start position:0%
politically if you get used to just
 
01:57:23.510 --> 01:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
thinking of yourself as a resource and
 
01:57:24.950 --> 01:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
the state can say well you're essential
 
01:57:26.330 --> 01:57:26.340 align:start position:0%
but you're not
 
01:57:28.129 --> 01:57:28.139 align:start position:0%
and what you do is important and I'm
 
01:57:29.990 --> 01:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
going to micromanage your business you
 
01:57:31.910 --> 01:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
start stop thinking of yourself as a
 
01:57:33.410 --> 01:57:33.420 align:start position:0%
citizen you start thinking yourself as
 
01:57:35.870 --> 01:57:35.880 align:start position:0%
something much more like a farm animal
 
01:57:38.750 --> 01:57:38.760 align:start position:0%
there's a constitutional reason if you
 
01:57:40.370 --> 01:57:40.380 align:start position:0%
check out article 83 of the State
 
01:57:42.290 --> 01:57:42.300 align:start position:0%
Constitution it actually identifies the
 
01:57:43.850 --> 01:57:43.860 align:start position:0%
right of the people and the
 
01:57:45.589 --> 01:57:45.599 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the state
 
01:57:47.450 --> 01:57:47.460 align:start position:0%
the right is that the people have an
 
01:57:49.310 --> 01:57:49.320 align:start position:0%
inherent and essential right to free and
 
01:57:51.290 --> 01:57:51.300 align:start position:0%
Fair competition in the trades and
 
01:57:53.750 --> 01:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
industries and the state the
 
01:57:55.430 --> 01:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
responsibility is the state has a
 
01:57:57.290 --> 01:57:57.300 align:start position:0%
responsibility to protect them from all
 
01:57:59.629 --> 01:57:59.639 align:start position:0%
monopolies that would hinder or destroy
 
01:58:01.910 --> 01:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
that right all monopolies not just
 
01:58:03.890 --> 01:58:03.900 align:start position:0%
private monopolies but State monopolies
 
01:58:03.900 --> 01:58:05.149 align:start position:0%
private monopolies but State monopolies
too

01:58:05.149 --> 01:58:05.159 align:start position:0%
too
 
01:58:07.370 --> 01:58:07.380 align:start position:0%
and Licensing when you distill it to its
 
01:58:09.709 --> 01:58:09.719 align:start position:0%
effort its Essence is in fact a
 
01:58:11.450 --> 01:58:11.460 align:start position:0%
Government monopoly that destroys
 
01:58:13.430 --> 01:58:13.440 align:start position:0%
competition by saying some people can do
 
01:58:16.370 --> 01:58:16.380 align:start position:0%
some things and other people can't
 
01:58:18.530 --> 01:58:18.540 align:start position:0%
it isn't just a bad idea it is
 
01:58:21.109 --> 01:58:21.119 align:start position:0%
flagrantly unconstitutional
 
01:58:22.850 --> 01:58:22.860 align:start position:0%
and there's a traditional reasonable
 
01:58:26.030 --> 01:58:26.040 align:start position:0%
finally so remember many of you probably
 
01:58:27.890 --> 01:58:27.900 align:start position:0%
remember when you were promised if you
 
01:58:30.290 --> 01:58:30.300 align:start position:0%
like your health plan you can keep it
 
01:58:32.270 --> 01:58:32.280 align:start position:0%
that turned out to be a lie but it
 
01:58:34.129 --> 01:58:34.139 align:start position:0%
encompasses the spirit of this bill if
 
01:58:35.990 --> 01:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
you like being able to tell your
 
01:58:37.970 --> 01:58:37.980 align:start position:0%
potential customers that you are
 
01:58:40.129 --> 01:58:40.139 align:start position:0%
licensed by the state you can still do
 
01:58:42.530 --> 01:58:42.540 align:start position:0%
it if you need to have a license in
 
01:58:44.149 --> 01:58:44.159 align:start position:0%
order because you want to do the bulk of
 
01:58:46.550 --> 01:58:46.560 align:start position:0%
your building through Insurance you can
 
01:58:50.149 --> 01:58:50.159 align:start position:0%
do it nobody's stopping you right and if
 
01:58:52.010 --> 01:58:52.020 align:start position:0%
you trust the government
 
01:58:55.129 --> 01:58:55.139 align:start position:0%
to protect you from slip shot or you
 
01:58:57.410 --> 01:58:57.420 align:start position:0%
know just uh from bad people slip shot
 
01:59:00.530 --> 01:59:00.540 align:start position:0%
Shady people you you're free to say I'm
 
01:59:02.030 --> 01:59:02.040 align:start position:0%
only going to deal with people who have
 
01:59:03.470 --> 01:59:03.480 align:start position:0%
a government license it doesn't change
 
01:59:06.229 --> 01:59:06.239 align:start position:0%
anything this takes away nothing from
 
01:59:06.239 --> 01:59:08.390 align:start position:0%
anything this takes away nothing from
anybody

01:59:08.390 --> 01:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
01:59:10.189 --> 01:59:10.199 align:start position:0%
but at the same time it actually
 
01:59:12.830 --> 01:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
Embraces traditionally the Live Free or
 
01:59:14.450 --> 01:59:14.460 align:start position:0%
Die Spirit of New Hampshire which is the
 
01:59:16.250 --> 01:59:16.260 align:start position:0%
freedom of each person to decide for
 
01:59:18.589 --> 01:59:18.599 align:start position:0%
himself how much risk he's willing to
 
01:59:20.510 --> 01:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
accept and which of the many
 
01:59:22.370 --> 01:59:22.380 align:start position:0%
non-government mechanisms for
 
01:59:24.589 --> 01:59:24.599 align:start position:0%
negotiating and mitigating that risk he
 
01:59:27.470 --> 01:59:27.480 align:start position:0%
prefers to rely on so the beauty of this
 
01:59:29.570 --> 01:59:29.580 align:start position:0%
bill is it offers certification but
 
01:59:31.790 --> 01:59:31.800 align:start position:0%
without coercion it offers reassurance
 
01:59:34.790 --> 01:59:34.800 align:start position:0%
but without repression and it offers
 
01:59:37.550 --> 01:59:37.560 align:start position:0%
protection without paternalism and I
 
01:59:40.550 --> 01:59:40.560 align:start position:0%
urge you to in the strongest possible
 
01:59:51.649 --> 01:59:51.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:53.750 --> 01:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much if anybody wants a
 
01:59:56.570 --> 01:59:56.580 align:start position:0%
book we can give them to you okay we'll
 
01:59:58.129 --> 01:59:58.139 align:start position:0%
definitely make sure to have one for the
 
02:00:00.229 --> 02:00:00.239 align:start position:0%
file if nothing else all right
 
02:00:02.209 --> 02:00:02.219 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
02:00:06.649 --> 02:00:06.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:09.109 --> 02:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none I will close the
 
02:00:10.310 --> 02:00:10.320 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
02:00:14.810 --> 02:00:14.820 align:start position:0%
and the committee will resume at 1 15.
 
02:00:17.089 --> 02:00:17.099 align:start position:0%

welcome to Edna I'm opening the public
 
03:17:31.610 --> 03:17:31.620 align:start position:0%

03:18:04.429 --> 03:18:04.439 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and committee
 
03:18:06.710 --> 03:18:06.720 align:start position:0%
members thank you for giving me the
 
03:18:09.950 --> 03:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity to introduce house bill 594.
 
03:18:12.230 --> 03:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
for the record I am representative Joe

Harrisville Sullivan starter Roxbury
 
03:18:26.030 --> 03:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
Marlboro Marlow and Nelson it took me a
 
03:18:27.830 --> 03:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
long time to get that
 
03:18:27.840 --> 03:18:29.150 align:start position:0%
long time to get that
um

03:18:29.150 --> 03:18:29.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:31.429 --> 03:18:31.439 align:start position:0%
having served on last year's committee
 
03:18:33.170 --> 03:18:33.180 align:start position:0%
to study and make recommendations
 
03:18:35.330 --> 03:18:35.340 align:start position:0%
relative to licensure and Mental Health
 
03:18:37.910 --> 03:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
Professions I'm here today to introduce
 
03:18:39.830 --> 03:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
one of the several bills coming out of
 
03:18:42.050 --> 03:18:42.060 align:start position:0%
that committee's work
 
03:18:44.570 --> 03:18:44.580 align:start position:0%
HB 594 was written with the
 
03:18:47.090 --> 03:18:47.100 align:start position:0%
collaboration of oplc
 
03:18:48.769 --> 03:18:48.779 align:start position:0%
and I'm not really sure if there's
 
03:18:54.290 --> 03:18:54.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:56.510 --> 03:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
this spill makes a small but important
 
03:18:58.370 --> 03:18:58.380 align:start position:0%
change in the statute related to
 
03:19:00.530 --> 03:19:00.540 align:start position:0%
reciprocity and all the boards operating
 
03:19:02.590 --> 03:19:02.600 align:start position:0%
under oplc
 
03:19:06.530 --> 03:19:06.540 align:start position:0%
RSA 310a as we heard in our study
 
03:19:10.429 --> 03:19:10.439 align:start position:0%
committee portability is often
 
03:19:13.190 --> 03:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
um a difficult process so when someone
 
03:19:16.550 --> 03:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
has a license in another state comes to
 
03:19:18.530 --> 03:19:18.540 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and applies for an
 
03:19:22.309 --> 03:19:22.319 align:start position:0%
equivalent license that process has
 
03:19:25.490 --> 03:19:25.500 align:start position:0%
um long been more onerous and
 
03:19:27.650 --> 03:19:27.660 align:start position:0%
complicated than many think it should be
 
03:19:30.710 --> 03:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
so this tries to in a very small way to
 
03:19:32.510 --> 03:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
address some of the concerns around
 
03:19:35.450 --> 03:19:35.460 align:start position:0%
portability or some people might refer
 
03:19:38.510 --> 03:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
to it as reciprocity
 
03:19:40.790 --> 03:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
the key language to be aware of in this
 
03:19:44.690 --> 03:19:44.700 align:start position:0%
bill is is on page one line six through
 
03:19:44.700 --> 03:19:45.710 align:start position:0%
bill is is on page one line six through
eight

03:19:45.710 --> 03:19:45.720 align:start position:0%
eight
 
03:19:48.650 --> 03:19:48.660 align:start position:0%
provided the jurisdictions licensing
 
03:19:51.050 --> 03:19:51.060 align:start position:0%
requirements of substantially similar to
 
03:19:52.969 --> 03:19:52.979 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's licensing requirements
 
03:19:56.690 --> 03:19:56.700 align:start position:0%
as determined by the executive director
 
03:19:58.849 --> 03:19:58.859 align:start position:0%
in other words assessing the equivalence
 
03:20:01.309 --> 03:20:01.319 align:start position:0%
of licensing requirements between the
 
03:20:03.469 --> 03:20:03.479 align:start position:0%
two relevant States a complex and
 
03:20:06.769 --> 03:20:06.779 align:start position:0%
onerous task for a volunteer board will
 
03:20:09.110 --> 03:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
now be the responsibility of the
 
03:20:11.269 --> 03:20:11.279 align:start position:0%
director of oplc
 
03:20:14.030 --> 03:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
rather than each individual board this
 
03:20:16.070 --> 03:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
will now be the case with all the boards
 
03:20:19.550 --> 03:20:19.560 align:start position:0%
under the jurisdiction of oplc
 
03:20:19.560 --> 03:20:20.150 align:start position:0%
under the jurisdiction of oplc
um

03:20:20.150 --> 03:20:20.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:20:23.030 --> 03:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
because of the study committee that I
 
03:20:24.530 --> 03:20:24.540 align:start position:0%
was on
 
03:20:24.540 --> 03:20:25.550 align:start position:0%
was on
um

03:20:25.550 --> 03:20:25.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:20:28.070 --> 03:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
the intention at first was to remove
 
03:20:30.349 --> 03:20:30.359 align:start position:0%
obstacles for
 
03:20:33.170 --> 03:20:33.180 align:start position:0%
the board of mental health the board of
 
03:20:35.590 --> 03:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder
 
03:20:37.309 --> 03:20:37.319 align:start position:0%
clinicians and the board of
 
03:20:37.319 --> 03:20:38.950 align:start position:0%
clinicians and the board of
psychologists

03:20:38.950 --> 03:20:38.960 align:start position:0%
psychologists
 
03:20:41.690 --> 03:20:41.700 align:start position:0%
but the bill kind of morphed into
 
03:20:43.309 --> 03:20:43.319 align:start position:0%
something a little bit different to
 
03:20:46.790 --> 03:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
address a very small issue but in all of
 
03:20:50.469 --> 03:20:50.479 align:start position:0%
the boards under oplc
 
03:20:52.490 --> 03:20:52.500 align:start position:0%
and I'd be very willing to take
 
03:20:54.469 --> 03:20:54.479 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much for your
 
03:21:00.710 --> 03:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:02.690 --> 03:21:02.700 align:start position:0%
I'd like to thank you for it because
 
03:21:07.670 --> 03:21:07.680 align:start position:0%
some years ago I asked the boards to
 
03:21:10.370 --> 03:21:10.380 align:start position:0%
rule or at least post where they had
 
03:21:12.710 --> 03:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
decided that some
 
03:21:15.349 --> 03:21:15.359 align:start position:0%
States requirements were substantially
 
03:21:18.370 --> 03:21:18.380 align:start position:0%
similar and I don't believe any board
 
03:21:22.809 --> 03:21:22.819 align:start position:0%
ever made that determination public
 
03:21:26.929 --> 03:21:26.939 align:start position:0%
so I appreciate your uh taking it out of
 
03:21:28.490 --> 03:21:28.500 align:start position:0%
there well I hope that this will address
 
03:21:32.150 --> 03:21:32.160 align:start position:0%
that and now that the staff of oplc can
 
03:21:35.450 --> 03:21:35.460 align:start position:0%
do this that they'll not only
 
03:21:38.870 --> 03:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
do it but do it thoroughly and have it
 
03:21:38.880 --> 03:21:39.410 align:start position:0%
do it but do it thoroughly and have it
um

03:21:39.410 --> 03:21:39.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:41.570 --> 03:21:41.580 align:start position:0%
clearly available for the public and
 
03:21:43.250 --> 03:21:43.260 align:start position:0%
clearly available for people who are
 
03:21:43.260 --> 03:21:44.690 align:start position:0%
clearly available for people who are
applying

03:21:44.690 --> 03:21:44.700 align:start position:0%
applying
 
03:21:47.510 --> 03:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
yes exactly that was my and I will say
 
03:21:50.090 --> 03:21:50.100 align:start position:0%
that my intention when I first proposed
 
03:21:53.090 --> 03:21:53.100 align:start position:0%
this bill was to have
 
03:21:53.100 --> 03:21:53.690 align:start position:0%
this bill was to have
um

03:21:53.690 --> 03:21:53.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:53.700 --> 03:21:56.150 align:start position:0%
um
yeah

03:21:56.150 --> 03:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:21:58.309 --> 03:21:58.319 align:start position:0%
a substitute
 
03:22:01.730 --> 03:22:01.740 align:start position:0%
for when Bill when when licenses were
 
03:22:03.769 --> 03:22:03.779 align:start position:0%
not substantially similar from the other
 
03:22:05.990 --> 03:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
state if the requirements were less in
 
03:22:07.250 --> 03:22:07.260 align:start position:0%
the other state than in New Hampshire
 
03:22:09.650 --> 03:22:09.660 align:start position:0%
that we could substitute a certain
 
03:22:11.870 --> 03:22:11.880 align:start position:0%
number of years of practice in good
 
03:22:14.870 --> 03:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
standing from those other states so that
 
03:22:16.610 --> 03:22:16.620 align:start position:0%
proved too complicated at the last
 
03:22:19.730 --> 03:22:19.740 align:start position:0%
minute with OLS and all the boards
 
03:22:21.230 --> 03:22:21.240 align:start position:0%
having different
 
03:22:21.240 --> 03:22:22.250 align:start position:0%
having different
um

03:22:22.250 --> 03:22:22.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:22:25.969 --> 03:22:25.979 align:start position:0%
you know different types of licensees
 
03:22:29.269 --> 03:22:29.279 align:start position:0%
and different requirements but that is
 
03:22:31.490 --> 03:22:31.500 align:start position:0%
something I hope to bring in the future
 
03:22:33.349 --> 03:22:33.359 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any other
 
03:22:36.710 --> 03:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
questions representative Schmidt
 
03:22:38.809 --> 03:22:38.819 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:22:40.910 --> 03:22:40.920 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
03:22:42.769 --> 03:22:42.779 align:start position:0%
to the degree you put it in the hands of
 
03:22:46.929 --> 03:22:46.939 align:start position:0%
the executive director uh you are
 
03:22:49.130 --> 03:22:49.140 align:start position:0%
subjecting yourself to the possibility
 
03:22:52.429 --> 03:22:52.439 align:start position:0%
of an executive director who don't like
 
03:22:55.309 --> 03:22:55.319 align:start position:0%
to do it that way
 
03:22:59.269 --> 03:22:59.279 align:start position:0%
um so have you given consideration to
 
03:23:01.910 --> 03:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
that possibility I I see the advantage
 
03:23:04.070 --> 03:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
obviously but what about the
 
03:23:04.080 --> 03:23:06.370 align:start position:0%
obviously but what about the
disadvantages

03:23:06.370 --> 03:23:06.380 align:start position:0%
disadvantages
 
03:23:09.710 --> 03:23:09.720 align:start position:0%
well I have long been a licensed social
 
03:23:11.210 --> 03:23:11.220 align:start position:0%
worker in the state of New Hampshire
 
03:23:13.010 --> 03:23:13.020 align:start position:0%
although I don't practice anymore so
 
03:23:15.130 --> 03:23:15.140 align:start position:0%
I've I've often dealt with
 
03:23:18.590 --> 03:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
the board of mental health practice and
 
03:23:21.110 --> 03:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
I think um
 
03:23:23.510 --> 03:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
and as you know as you probably hear all
 
03:23:25.790 --> 03:23:25.800 align:start position:0%
the time people talk about
 
03:23:27.950 --> 03:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
um Workforce shortage especially in
 
03:23:31.309 --> 03:23:31.319 align:start position:0%
mental health and one of only one part
 
03:23:33.530 --> 03:23:33.540 align:start position:0%
of the puzzle is that it's
 
03:23:33.540 --> 03:23:34.610 align:start position:0%
of the puzzle is that it's
um

03:23:34.610 --> 03:23:34.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:23:36.710 --> 03:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
people complain about the licensing
 
03:23:39.530 --> 03:23:39.540 align:start position:0%
process and I think there are two issues
 
03:23:41.450 --> 03:23:41.460 align:start position:0%
when it comes for licensing there there
 
03:23:43.790 --> 03:23:43.800 align:start position:0%
are the laws things like we're trying to
 
03:23:46.130 --> 03:23:46.140 align:start position:0%
address today but there's also the
 
03:23:48.889 --> 03:23:48.899 align:start position:0%
actual functioning of the boards and I
 
03:23:48.899 --> 03:23:49.910 align:start position:0%
actual functioning of the boards and I
think

03:23:49.910 --> 03:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
think
 
03:23:52.790 --> 03:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
you know at various times in my career
 
03:23:54.710 --> 03:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
you could always call the board of
 
03:23:56.450 --> 03:23:56.460 align:start position:0%
mental health practice and there was
 
03:23:57.889 --> 03:23:57.899 align:start position:0%
someone who'd been there for a long time
 
03:23:59.630 --> 03:23:59.640 align:start position:0%
and was incredibly knowledgeable and
 
03:24:01.969 --> 03:24:01.979 align:start position:0%
give you the answer you needed and then
 
03:24:04.010 --> 03:24:04.020 align:start position:0%
at other times there were people
 
03:24:06.050 --> 03:24:06.060 align:start position:0%
changing all the time and there was a
 
03:24:07.610 --> 03:24:07.620 align:start position:0%
volunteer board and they had a hard time
 
03:24:09.650 --> 03:24:09.660 align:start position:0%
going in a quorum and they had a hard
 
03:24:11.690 --> 03:24:11.700 align:start position:0%
time meeting to make decisions on these
 
03:24:13.070 --> 03:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
things so
 
03:24:15.410 --> 03:24:15.420 align:start position:0%
I think
 
03:24:18.170 --> 03:24:18.180 align:start position:0%
of course anything could go wrong but I
 
03:24:20.830 --> 03:24:20.840 align:start position:0%
think having a paid professional staff
 
03:24:24.170 --> 03:24:24.180 align:start position:0%
doing this function will give it a
 
03:24:27.110 --> 03:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
better chance of actually happening on a
 
03:24:30.469 --> 03:24:30.479 align:start position:0%
across the across the boards
 
03:24:33.710 --> 03:24:33.720 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up okay so the thing is
 
03:24:37.309 --> 03:24:37.319 align:start position:0%
uh I see the advantages as you do
 
03:24:41.990 --> 03:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
um but to some degree uh any mental
 
03:24:44.330 --> 03:24:44.340 align:start position:0%
health is mental health pretty well ever
 
03:24:47.090 --> 03:24:47.100 align:start position:0%
aware cause planet or Nationwide for
 
03:24:51.650 --> 03:24:51.660 align:start position:0%
sure uh some some boards would be uh it
 
03:24:55.070 --> 03:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
would be less I mean the type of
 
03:24:57.590 --> 03:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
structure that they build uh in the
 
03:25:00.229 --> 03:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
South versus North is influenced by
 
03:25:02.870 --> 03:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
climate topography it's culture and so
 
03:25:04.969 --> 03:25:04.979 align:start position:0%
forth and so on so the architecture
 
03:25:07.250 --> 03:25:07.260 align:start position:0%
board would would be more
 
03:25:12.050 --> 03:25:12.060 align:start position:0%
uh chat a hard challenge hard put to
 
03:25:15.729 --> 03:25:15.739 align:start position:0%
um to discover or to determine
 
03:25:19.309 --> 03:25:19.319 align:start position:0%
compatibility suitability uh you know
 
03:25:22.130 --> 03:25:22.140 align:start position:0%
and so forth uh then mental health
 
03:25:24.349 --> 03:25:24.359 align:start position:0%
practice your field
 
03:25:26.330 --> 03:25:26.340 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:25:28.490 --> 03:25:28.500 align:start position:0%
in putting it in the hands of the
 
03:25:30.590 --> 03:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
executive director you're taking away
 
03:25:32.530 --> 03:25:32.540 align:start position:0%
the board's expertise
 
03:25:38.150 --> 03:25:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:40.010 --> 03:25:40.020 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
03:25:43.809 --> 03:25:43.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:46.490 --> 03:25:46.500 align:start position:0%
is as determined by the executive
 
03:25:48.950 --> 03:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
director in culture in consultation with
 
03:25:51.349 --> 03:25:51.359 align:start position:0%
the boards and commissions
 
03:25:53.690 --> 03:25:53.700 align:start position:0%
so the intention of having them be
 
03:25:55.429 --> 03:25:55.439 align:start position:0%
involved in the process is certainly
 
03:25:55.439 --> 03:25:56.570 align:start position:0%
involved in the process is certainly
there

03:25:56.570 --> 03:25:56.580 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:25:58.790 --> 03:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
right and that is that is the
 
03:26:01.389 --> 03:26:01.399 align:start position:0%
consultation usually means the the
 
03:26:04.010 --> 03:26:04.020 align:start position:0%
executive director would not
 
03:26:07.910 --> 03:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh overrule the input from the board
 
03:26:10.070 --> 03:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
is that your understanding of it because
 
03:26:12.769 --> 03:26:12.779 align:start position:0%
in in creating a record here that would
 
03:26:15.670 --> 03:26:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:18.110 --> 03:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
to tell you the truth I haven't really
 
03:26:20.450 --> 03:26:20.460 align:start position:0%
thought that through but also more
 
03:26:20.460 --> 03:26:21.769 align:start position:0%
thought that through but also more
importantly

03:26:21.769 --> 03:26:21.779 align:start position:0%
importantly
 
03:26:24.110 --> 03:26:24.120 align:start position:0%
I don't think what I think about that or
 
03:26:26.090 --> 03:26:26.100 align:start position:0%
the way I would go about doing it if I
 
03:26:27.769 --> 03:26:27.779 align:start position:0%
was the executive director and how I
 
03:26:29.630 --> 03:26:29.640 align:start position:0%
would relate to the boards
 
03:26:31.190 --> 03:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
I don't think that's necessarily
 
03:26:33.410 --> 03:26:33.420 align:start position:0%
relevant to the way the people who were
 
03:26:35.870 --> 03:26:35.880 align:start position:0%
employed now would do it I mean some of
 
03:26:37.790 --> 03:26:37.800 align:start position:0%
it is you know individual management
 
03:26:37.800 --> 03:26:39.050 align:start position:0%
it is you know individual management
style

03:26:39.050 --> 03:26:39.060 align:start position:0%
style
 
03:26:41.030 --> 03:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
03:26:45.050 --> 03:26:45.060 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative first
 
03:26:46.490 --> 03:26:46.500 align:start position:0%
is this going to go to licensing
 
03:26:48.650 --> 03:26:48.660 align:start position:0%
subcommittee if it needs to go to a
 
03:26:49.969 --> 03:26:49.979 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that's the one that we'll
 
03:26:52.849 --> 03:26:52.859 align:start position:0%
go to yes okay thank you um
 
03:26:55.790 --> 03:26:55.800 align:start position:0%
defend the question is if if we do have
 
03:26:57.410 --> 03:26:57.420 align:start position:0%
a subcommittee to work on this which I
 
03:26:58.429 --> 03:26:58.439 align:start position:0%
don't know that we will would you be
 
03:27:02.150 --> 03:27:02.160 align:start position:0%
available to uh to help us out I will do
 
03:27:06.769 --> 03:27:06.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:09.349 --> 03:27:09.359 align:start position:0%
and not seeing any other questions thank
 
03:27:12.170 --> 03:27:12.180 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony
 
03:27:12.180 --> 03:27:13.790 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony
um

03:27:13.790 --> 03:27:13.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:27:26.630 --> 03:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:28.550 --> 03:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
hello again thank you madam chair and
 
03:27:30.290 --> 03:27:30.300 align:start position:0%
thank you committee members my name is
 
03:27:31.849 --> 03:27:31.859 align:start position:0%
Sarah Holland I'm a licensed real estate
 
03:27:34.429 --> 03:27:34.439 align:start position:0%
broker I'm here on behalf of the New
 
03:27:38.090 --> 03:27:38.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Realtors we are opposed to HP
 
03:27:41.809 --> 03:27:41.819 align:start position:0%
594 as it's currently written we
 
03:27:43.910 --> 03:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
understand that it may have the intent
 
03:27:46.969 --> 03:27:46.979 align:start position:0%
behind it to apply to one or some but
 
03:27:49.550 --> 03:27:49.560 align:start position:0%
not all professions of the oplc and
 
03:27:53.330 --> 03:27:53.340 align:start position:0%
we'll submit that last year HB 1354 was
 
03:27:55.969 --> 03:27:55.979 align:start position:0%
passed and went into effect last August
 
03:27:58.150 --> 03:27:58.160 align:start position:0%
and this bill
 
03:28:00.710 --> 03:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
allows for a recognition of real estate
 
03:28:02.990 --> 03:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
licenses in other states provided that
 
03:28:04.250 --> 03:28:04.260 align:start position:0%
they first pass the New Hampshire
 
03:28:07.790 --> 03:28:07.800 align:start position:0%
portion of the licensing exam so this
 
03:28:11.750 --> 03:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
bill HB 594 would kind of upturn that
 
03:28:14.830 --> 03:28:14.840 align:start position:0%
recognition recognition process and
 
03:28:17.870 --> 03:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
apply reciprocity and the difference
 
03:28:20.510 --> 03:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
would be in that testing portion and for
 
03:28:22.670 --> 03:28:22.680 align:start position:0%
those licensees to prove that they
 
03:28:25.190 --> 03:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
understand and have a basis in the New
 
03:28:27.050 --> 03:28:27.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law to better protect to
 
03:28:28.969 --> 03:28:28.979 align:start position:0%
Consumers and from my own personal
 
03:28:31.130 --> 03:28:31.140 align:start position:0%
experience I am currently licensed in
 
03:28:33.950 --> 03:28:33.960 align:start position:0%
two states New Hampshire and Vermont and
 
03:28:35.210 --> 03:28:35.220 align:start position:0%
I could tell you that their laws are
 
03:28:37.969 --> 03:28:37.979 align:start position:0%
vastly different I was previously
 
03:28:41.510 --> 03:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
licensed in four and I licensed I was
 
03:28:43.070 --> 03:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
licensed in Massachusetts through
 
03:28:46.190 --> 03:28:46.200 align:start position:0%
recognition I took an exam in order to
 
03:28:47.809 --> 03:28:47.819 align:start position:0%
prove that I understood the
 
03:28:49.429 --> 03:28:49.439 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts laws and regulations
 
03:28:52.309 --> 03:28:52.319 align:start position:0%
however from Massachusetts to my
 
03:28:54.769 --> 03:28:54.779 align:start position:0%
licensure in Connecticut they said oh
 
03:28:57.429 --> 03:28:57.439 align:start position:0%
we're fine you can just have a license
 
03:29:00.309 --> 03:29:00.319 align:start position:0%
which was
 
03:29:03.469 --> 03:29:03.479 align:start position:0%
unnerving to me I did not feel
 
03:29:05.870 --> 03:29:05.880 align:start position:0%
comfortable practicing in Connecticut
 
03:29:09.889 --> 03:29:09.899 align:start position:0%
having zero requirement of their laws
 
03:29:12.170 --> 03:29:12.180 align:start position:0%
and rules and regulations
 
03:29:12.180 --> 03:29:13.849 align:start position:0%
and rules and regulations
um so

03:29:13.849 --> 03:29:13.859 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:29:16.070 --> 03:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
I can attest that the laws are
 
03:29:17.929 --> 03:29:17.939 align:start position:0%
incredibly different in each state and
 
03:29:20.450 --> 03:29:20.460 align:start position:0%
having that basic knowledge that
 
03:29:23.870 --> 03:29:23.880 align:start position:0%
recognition requires not reciprocity is
 
03:29:25.490 --> 03:29:25.500 align:start position:0%
simply the lowest bar that we should
 
03:29:27.410 --> 03:29:27.420 align:start position:0%
have for Consumer Protection
 
03:29:31.130 --> 03:29:31.140 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions thank you I
 
03:29:33.410 --> 03:29:33.420 align:start position:0%
would say that even as someone who knows
 
03:29:36.290 --> 03:29:36.300 align:start position:0%
almost nothing about real estate I I'm
 
03:29:38.170 --> 03:29:38.180 align:start position:0%
aware that the
 
03:29:42.349 --> 03:29:42.359 align:start position:0%
laws in the licenses in Massachusetts or
 
03:29:44.690 --> 03:29:44.700 align:start position:0%
Vermont or Maine are not substantially
 
03:29:46.969 --> 03:29:46.979 align:start position:0%
similar to New Hampshire because of our
 
03:29:50.630 --> 03:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
weird land laws absolutely so I think
 
03:29:53.450 --> 03:29:53.460 align:start position:0%
that that's a the simplest explanation
 
03:29:55.010 --> 03:29:55.020 align:start position:0%
is that they're not substantially
 
03:29:57.110 --> 03:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
similar and they can't be substantially
 
03:29:59.450 --> 03:29:59.460 align:start position:0%
similar yes so
 
03:30:02.870 --> 03:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
if that's agreed thank you any other
 
03:30:05.870 --> 03:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
questions representative schuette
 
03:30:07.670 --> 03:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you very
 
03:30:10.130 --> 03:30:10.140 align:start position:0%
much for taking my question
 
03:30:14.510 --> 03:30:14.520 align:start position:0%
um having been involved in drafting some
 
03:30:20.210 --> 03:30:20.220 align:start position:0%
of the rules for oplc myself last term I
 
03:30:23.330 --> 03:30:23.340 align:start position:0%
was insistent that that phrase in
 
03:30:26.090 --> 03:30:26.100 align:start position:0%
consultation with the awards commissions
 
03:30:29.510 --> 03:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
and councils be included on several
 
03:30:29.520 --> 03:30:31.450 align:start position:0%
and councils be included on several
instances

03:30:31.450 --> 03:30:31.460 align:start position:0%
instances
 
03:30:35.870 --> 03:30:35.880 align:start position:0%
have you had the opportunity to make
 
03:30:38.630 --> 03:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
consultations with the director and have
 
03:30:41.929 --> 03:30:41.939 align:start position:0%
you encountered difficulties with that
 
03:30:44.630 --> 03:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
um we are in um conversation with the
 
03:30:47.150 --> 03:30:47.160 align:start position:0%
director we we have um
 
03:30:49.729 --> 03:30:49.739 align:start position:0%
brought her to our organization to speak
 
03:30:52.910 --> 03:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
and be updated and we have we do have
 
03:30:55.790 --> 03:30:55.800 align:start position:0%
um a good line of communication with her
 
03:30:55.800 --> 03:30:57.769 align:start position:0%
um a good line of communication with her
absolutely

03:30:57.769 --> 03:30:57.779 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
03:30:59.990 --> 03:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
um our concern was that there may be
 
03:31:02.090 --> 03:31:02.100 align:start position:0%
some confusion in how this bill is
 
03:31:05.330 --> 03:31:05.340 align:start position:0%
written based on what we previously
 
03:31:07.370 --> 03:31:07.380 align:start position:0%
passed last year relative to our
 
03:31:09.650 --> 03:31:09.660 align:start position:0%
specific industry so we just wanted to
 
03:31:12.830 --> 03:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
clarify and be on record doing so
 
03:31:15.889 --> 03:31:15.899 align:start position:0%
okay thank you other questions
 
03:31:17.510 --> 03:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none thank you very
 
03:31:17.520 --> 03:31:20.510 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none thank you very
much

03:31:20.510 --> 03:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:22.370 --> 03:31:22.380 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
03:31:25.750 --> 03:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
testify on House Bill 594.
 
03:31:28.309 --> 03:31:28.319 align:start position:0%
I was going to have a questions
 
03:31:30.050 --> 03:31:30.060 align:start position:0%
ah well then it's a good thing she's
 
03:31:32.150 --> 03:31:32.160 align:start position:0%
volunteered yes
 
03:31:37.429 --> 03:31:37.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:40.250 --> 03:31:40.260 align:start position:0%
for whom sorry for our uh executive
 
03:31:43.010 --> 03:31:43.020 align:start position:0%
director Courtney
 
03:31:48.309 --> 03:31:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:51.110 --> 03:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
I didn't think you could Escape did you
 
03:31:53.030 --> 03:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
good afternoon for the record Lindsey
 
03:31:54.710 --> 03:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
Courtney executive director office of
 
03:31:55.370 --> 03:31:55.380 align:start position:0%
professional life insurance
 
03:31:57.830 --> 03:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
certification and we have to answer your
 
03:32:00.349 --> 03:32:00.359 align:start position:0%
question representative because
 
03:32:00.359 --> 03:32:01.510 align:start position:0%
question representative because
um

03:32:01.510 --> 03:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:03.710 --> 03:32:03.720 align:start position:0%
thank you so
 
03:32:03.720 --> 03:32:04.910 align:start position:0%
thank you so
um

03:32:04.910 --> 03:32:04.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:08.630 --> 03:32:08.640 align:start position:0%
a number of concerns one is that if
 
03:32:11.450 --> 03:32:11.460 align:start position:0%
House Bill 409 which you know you're
 
03:32:13.849 --> 03:32:13.859 align:start position:0%
you're involved in uh an amendment for
 
03:32:16.190 --> 03:32:16.200 align:start position:0%
that were to be adopted by the
 
03:32:18.950 --> 03:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
legislature and going along it looks
 
03:32:22.490 --> 03:32:22.500 align:start position:0%
like this would override it and uh
 
03:32:25.309 --> 03:32:25.319 align:start position:0%
eliminate the general reciprocity that
 
03:32:27.410 --> 03:32:27.420 align:start position:0%
was the intent to that so my question is
 
03:32:30.170 --> 03:32:30.180 align:start position:0%
is that correct and and related
 
03:32:33.290 --> 03:32:33.300 align:start position:0%
are there any other licenses where there
 
03:32:34.690 --> 03:32:34.700 align:start position:0%
are some
 
03:32:37.610 --> 03:32:37.620 align:start position:0%
reciprocity provisions
 
03:32:40.130 --> 03:32:40.140 align:start position:0%
that might be less restrictive where
 
03:32:42.590 --> 03:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
passing this would would make it more
 
03:32:42.600 --> 03:32:43.910 align:start position:0%
passing this would would make it more
restrictive

03:32:43.910 --> 03:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
restrictive
 
03:32:45.710 --> 03:32:45.720 align:start position:0%
so I'll answer the second question first
 
03:32:48.469 --> 03:32:48.479 align:start position:0%
which is I'm not aware of any that are
 
03:32:54.170 --> 03:32:54.180 align:start position:0%
less restrictive and actually in 332g
 
03:32:55.990 --> 03:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
I think it's 12
 
03:32:58.550 --> 03:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
which only applies to our title 30 words
 
03:33:00.290 --> 03:33:00.300 align:start position:0%
it doesn't apply to our non-title 30
 
03:33:02.809 --> 03:33:02.819 align:start position:0%
boards I believe they use the term
 
03:33:06.349 --> 03:33:06.359 align:start position:0%
substantial substantially equivalent
 
03:33:09.830 --> 03:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
we chose to use substantially similar
 
03:33:11.750 --> 03:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
um maybe there's not too much of a
 
03:33:14.090 --> 03:33:14.100 align:start position:0%
distinction but the the intent was to be
 
03:33:16.849 --> 03:33:16.859 align:start position:0%
a little bit less restrictive because
 
03:33:19.010 --> 03:33:19.020 align:start position:0%
what we've observed is that equivalency
 
03:33:21.710 --> 03:33:21.720 align:start position:0%
language is often utilized even if you
 
03:33:24.229 --> 03:33:24.239 align:start position:0%
meet 95 of the requirements like what is
 
03:33:26.210 --> 03:33:26.220 align:start position:0%
substantially equivalent substantially
 
03:33:28.070 --> 03:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
similar would give us a little bit more
 
03:33:31.130 --> 03:33:31.140 align:start position:0%
flexibility in assessing those uh
 
03:33:33.229 --> 03:33:33.239 align:start position:0%
requirements in terms of the other
 
03:33:37.510 --> 03:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
question as to how many other
 
03:33:41.450 --> 03:33:41.460 align:start position:0%
reciprocity type statutes exist most
 
03:33:45.229 --> 03:33:45.239 align:start position:0%
boards have some language in their
 
03:33:47.929 --> 03:33:47.939 align:start position:0%
individual practice acts that allow them
 
03:33:51.110 --> 03:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
to promulgate rules and licensure
 
03:33:53.090 --> 03:33:53.100 align:start position:0%
requirements for individuals who are
 
03:33:55.610 --> 03:33:55.620 align:start position:0%
licensed in other jurisdictions I would
 
03:33:58.309 --> 03:33:58.319 align:start position:0%
say though that the boards have not
 
03:34:00.830 --> 03:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
consistently exercised that Authority
 
03:34:04.490 --> 03:34:04.500 align:start position:0%
and also the requirements very
 
03:34:04.500 --> 03:34:05.929 align:start position:0%
and also the requirements very
substantially

03:34:05.929 --> 03:34:05.939 align:start position:0%
substantially
 
03:34:08.510 --> 03:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
when I think of reciprocity or
 
03:34:11.809 --> 03:34:11.819 align:start position:0%
portability I think of essentially if
 
03:34:14.269 --> 03:34:14.279 align:start position:0%
you have another jurisdiction with very
 
03:34:16.429 --> 03:34:16.439 align:start position:0%
similar requirements
 
03:34:18.290 --> 03:34:18.300 align:start position:0%
um not requiring that person to jump
 
03:34:21.229 --> 03:34:21.239 align:start position:0%
through extra Hoops to get a license
 
03:34:21.239 --> 03:34:22.190 align:start position:0%
through extra Hoops to get a license
um

03:34:22.190 --> 03:34:22.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:26.330 --> 03:34:26.340 align:start position:0%
some boards have license types that are
 
03:34:28.670 --> 03:34:28.680 align:start position:0%
based on endorsement but actually
 
03:34:32.269 --> 03:34:32.279 align:start position:0%
require them to do more than a licensed
 
03:34:32.279 --> 03:34:33.849 align:start position:0%
require them to do more than a licensed
person

03:34:33.849 --> 03:34:33.859 align:start position:0%
person
 
03:34:36.490 --> 03:34:36.500 align:start position:0%
who takes an examination
 
03:34:39.229 --> 03:34:39.239 align:start position:0%
the board of psychology for example if
 
03:34:41.929 --> 03:34:41.939 align:start position:0%
you they have a licensure by endorsement
 
03:34:44.570 --> 03:34:44.580 align:start position:0%
or a reciprocity they still have to go
 
03:34:47.210 --> 03:34:47.220 align:start position:0%
and get their supervisors to sign off
 
03:34:49.190 --> 03:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
even if they've been licensed for 30
 
03:34:50.570 --> 03:34:50.580 align:start position:0%
years in addition to getting
 
03:34:53.150 --> 03:34:53.160 align:start position:0%
verifications of licensure
 
03:34:57.170 --> 03:34:57.180 align:start position:0%
so globally what this is intended to do
 
03:35:01.429 --> 03:35:01.439 align:start position:0%
is create one process for the office to
 
03:35:03.769 --> 03:35:03.779 align:start position:0%
manage and Implement as it relates to
 
03:35:06.050 --> 03:35:06.060 align:start position:0%
portability the idea was to take it out
 
03:35:08.690 --> 03:35:08.700 align:start position:0%
of 332g because that doesn't apply to
 
03:35:10.790 --> 03:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
all of our boards put it in our statute
 
03:35:13.130 --> 03:35:13.140 align:start position:0%
because it applies to all of our boards
 
03:35:15.590 --> 03:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
and because we've observed that null
 
03:35:18.170 --> 03:35:18.180 align:start position:0%
actually I don't think any board has
 
03:35:20.030 --> 03:35:20.040 align:start position:0%
made an official determination under
 
03:35:22.370 --> 03:35:22.380 align:start position:0%
332g as to what other states are
 
03:35:25.670 --> 03:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
substantially equivalent we thought by
 
03:35:28.729 --> 03:35:28.739 align:start position:0%
giving it to the oplc in consultation
 
03:35:30.889 --> 03:35:30.899 align:start position:0%
with the boards that would kind of force
 
03:35:32.630 --> 03:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
the issue a little bit we would have a
 
03:35:35.150 --> 03:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
little bit more control over making that
 
03:35:37.309 --> 03:35:37.319 align:start position:0%
happen implementing it
 
03:35:38.889 --> 03:35:38.899 align:start position:0%
um so I hope that answers your question
 
03:35:42.650 --> 03:35:42.660 align:start position:0%
follow up yeah uh it it largely does I
 
03:35:44.389 --> 03:35:44.399 align:start position:0%
still have a specific question about HP
 
03:35:47.210 --> 03:35:47.220 align:start position:0%
409 where we're looking at assuming that
 
03:35:49.670 --> 03:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
we're going to law do something was
 
03:35:51.349 --> 03:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
actually a little less restrictive than
 
03:35:53.990 --> 03:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
this so
 
03:35:56.750 --> 03:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
um would it require some amendment to
 
03:36:00.769 --> 03:36:00.779 align:start position:0%
this to to let 409 work if it were and
 
03:36:03.349 --> 03:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
then if the answer is yes if you could
 
03:36:05.090 --> 03:36:05.100 align:start position:0%
work with us on some language
 
03:36:06.590 --> 03:36:06.600 align:start position:0%
I actually think it would obviate the
 
03:36:09.889 --> 03:36:09.899 align:start position:0%
need for HP 409 because this would
 
03:36:11.990 --> 03:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
create a structure
 
03:36:15.469 --> 03:36:15.479 align:start position:0%
um where essentially Most states are for
 
03:36:17.690 --> 03:36:17.700 align:start position:0%
cosmetology anyways are substantial if
 
03:36:19.190 --> 03:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
not all states are substantially similar
 
03:36:20.510 --> 03:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
to our requirements I think we heard
 
03:36:22.729 --> 03:36:22.739 align:start position:0%
that testimony with respect to HP 409
 
03:36:23.750 --> 03:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
you know there are some hours
 
03:36:26.630 --> 03:36:26.640 align:start position:0%
differences but um when we talk about
 
03:36:26.640 --> 03:36:28.849 align:start position:0%
differences but um when we talk about
similarities

03:36:28.849 --> 03:36:28.859 align:start position:0%
similarities
 
03:36:31.990 --> 03:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
um I would not Envision a scenario where
 
03:36:34.910 --> 03:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions would be eliminated and
 
03:36:36.830 --> 03:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
the other thing that I would offer with
 
03:36:39.710 --> 03:36:39.720 align:start position:0%
respect to the experience issue that was
 
03:36:42.889 --> 03:36:42.899 align:start position:0%
discussed by representative Shapiro we
 
03:36:45.010 --> 03:36:45.020 align:start position:0%
have a similar language in the massage
 
03:36:48.710 --> 03:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
statute which is an Advisory Board and
 
03:36:51.170 --> 03:36:51.180 align:start position:0%
we just promulgated some rules using
 
03:36:53.389 --> 03:36:53.399 align:start position:0%
this language that allows us to take
 
03:36:56.809 --> 03:36:56.819 align:start position:0%
into consideration experience if the
 
03:36:58.250 --> 03:36:58.260 align:start position:0%
hours requirements of another
 
03:37:01.250 --> 03:37:01.260 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction does not is not the same as
 
03:37:03.650 --> 03:37:03.660 align:start position:0%
our hours requirement so I do think
 
03:37:05.690 --> 03:37:05.700 align:start position:0%
under under rules that could be
 
03:37:07.610 --> 03:37:07.620 align:start position:0%
certainly something that we consider as
 
03:37:09.950 --> 03:37:09.960 align:start position:0%
well because if you've participated in a
 
03:37:11.870 --> 03:37:11.880 align:start position:0%
cosmetology program that's you know a
 
03:37:13.910 --> 03:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
thousand hours ours is 1500 but you've
 
03:37:16.250 --> 03:37:16.260 align:start position:0%
practiced for 30 years you know is that
 
03:37:19.010 --> 03:37:19.020 align:start position:0%
not a substantially similar requirement
 
03:37:20.450 --> 03:37:20.460 align:start position:0%
I think
 
03:37:22.429 --> 03:37:22.439 align:start position:0%
one could make that argument pursuant to
 
03:37:22.439 --> 03:37:26.090 align:start position:0%
one could make that argument pursuant to
rules

03:37:26.090 --> 03:37:26.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:27.950 --> 03:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
okay thank you I was not reading
 
03:37:31.130 --> 03:37:31.140 align:start position:0%
substantially similar as broadly as you
 
03:37:32.990 --> 03:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
apparently were and it's actually true
 
03:37:34.849 --> 03:37:34.859 align:start position:0%
that with this language
 
03:37:37.309 --> 03:37:37.319 align:start position:0%
you can put in place rules that would
 
03:37:40.849 --> 03:37:40.859 align:start position:0%
help you define what we get approval for
 
03:37:42.530 --> 03:37:42.540 align:start position:0%
defining what you you know how broad
 
03:37:44.809 --> 03:37:44.819 align:start position:0%
that range is I guess the question
 
03:37:46.550 --> 03:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
yeah I think we would rely on our
 
03:37:48.349 --> 03:37:48.359 align:start position:0%
existing rulemaking authority to
 
03:37:49.729 --> 03:37:49.739 align:start position:0%
implement that
 
03:37:51.950 --> 03:37:51.960 align:start position:0%
um again that is a question right what
 
03:37:54.650 --> 03:37:54.660 align:start position:0%
is substantially similar and we've had a
 
03:37:57.229 --> 03:37:57.239 align:start position:0%
couple of boards undergo basically a
 
03:37:59.389 --> 03:37:59.399 align:start position:0%
policy audit through a contract that we
 
03:38:01.490 --> 03:38:01.500 align:start position:0%
had a couple years back one of them was
 
03:38:03.590 --> 03:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
the board of Licensing for alcohol and
 
03:38:06.170 --> 03:38:06.180 align:start position:0%
drug use counselors and they did a whole
 
03:38:09.110 --> 03:38:09.120 align:start position:0%
analysis a nationwide as to what every
 
03:38:11.090 --> 03:38:11.100 align:start position:0%
State's requirements were
 
03:38:14.150 --> 03:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
and we're able to present to us if you
 
03:38:16.370 --> 03:38:16.380 align:start position:0%
determine that substantially similar is
 
03:38:19.550 --> 03:38:19.560 align:start position:0%
70 of the requirements you're you know
 
03:38:21.469 --> 03:38:21.479 align:start position:0%
you're going to get 30 States for
 
03:38:21.479 --> 03:38:22.729 align:start position:0%
you're going to get 30 States for
example

03:38:22.729 --> 03:38:22.739 align:start position:0%
example
 
03:38:24.769 --> 03:38:24.779 align:start position:0%
um if it's 80 you're only going to get
 
03:38:26.870 --> 03:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
eight you know so what is the percentage
 
03:38:29.330 --> 03:38:29.340 align:start position:0%
in terms of the requirements as to what
 
03:38:31.550 --> 03:38:31.560 align:start position:0%
is substantially equivalent the board
 
03:38:35.090 --> 03:38:35.100 align:start position:0%
hasn't made that determination yet so we
 
03:38:37.130 --> 03:38:37.140 align:start position:0%
would like to work with them to make
 
03:38:39.590 --> 03:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
that determination and I I think it's
 
03:38:42.710 --> 03:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
fairly broad as to what's substantially
 
03:38:45.050 --> 03:38:45.060 align:start position:0%
similar okay thank you
 
03:38:47.269 --> 03:38:47.279 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
03:38:47.279 --> 03:38:49.490 align:start position:0%
any other questions
Schmidt

03:38:49.490 --> 03:38:49.500 align:start position:0%
Schmidt
 
03:38:51.170 --> 03:38:51.180 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:38:53.809 --> 03:38:53.819 align:start position:0%
uh so the thing is with your legal
 
03:38:56.030 --> 03:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
background you're probably unusually
 
03:38:59.150 --> 03:38:59.160 align:start position:0%
qualified to get into that but the thing
 
03:39:01.910 --> 03:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
is this is going to require much more
 
03:39:05.090 --> 03:39:05.100 align:start position:0%
engagement from you on these types of
 
03:39:08.210 --> 03:39:08.220 align:start position:0%
issues obviously to the degree you can
 
03:39:10.610 --> 03:39:10.620 align:start position:0%
depend on boards to provide you with
 
03:39:12.710 --> 03:39:12.720 align:start position:0%
good information it's not going to be
 
03:39:17.269 --> 03:39:17.279 align:start position:0%
you like Atlas lifting the world uh but
 
03:39:17.279 --> 03:39:18.290 align:start position:0%
you like Atlas lifting the world uh but
um

03:39:18.290 --> 03:39:18.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:20.570 --> 03:39:20.580 align:start position:0%
it is going to be more work is is that
 
03:39:23.929 --> 03:39:23.939 align:start position:0%
an aspect that uh who have reservations
 
03:39:25.969 --> 03:39:25.979 align:start position:0%
about this bill
 
03:39:28.849 --> 03:39:28.859 align:start position:0%
no I actually think it'll be helpful to
 
03:39:30.889 --> 03:39:30.899 align:start position:0%
the office because right now we are
 
03:39:33.830 --> 03:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
managing and trying to
 
03:39:33.840 --> 03:39:34.990 align:start position:0%
managing and trying to
um

03:39:34.990 --> 03:39:35.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:37.969 --> 03:39:37.979 align:start position:0%
basically harmonize
 
03:39:40.190 --> 03:39:40.200 align:start position:0%
statutes with the same intent but with
 
03:39:41.570 --> 03:39:41.580 align:start position:0%
different language you know you've got
 
03:39:43.790 --> 03:39:43.800 align:start position:0%
the reciprocity language in 332g you've
 
03:39:45.410 --> 03:39:45.420 align:start position:0%
got an each practice act you've got some
 
03:39:47.330 --> 03:39:47.340 align:start position:0%
temporary licensure it would be nice to
 
03:39:49.849 --> 03:39:49.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:51.710 --> 03:39:51.720 align:start position:0%
um that we could look to and work with
 
03:39:53.150 --> 03:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
the boards to implement
 
03:39:55.670 --> 03:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
under oplc statute that would certainly
 
03:39:58.070 --> 03:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
be a statutory directive to us to make
 
03:40:00.110 --> 03:40:00.120 align:start position:0%
sure that we have
 
03:40:02.150 --> 03:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
um we're meeting the requirements of
 
03:40:04.670 --> 03:40:04.680 align:start position:0%
this proposed statute so you know
 
03:40:07.130 --> 03:40:07.140 align:start position:0%
essentially we would move forward with
 
03:40:08.990 --> 03:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
working with the boards and my
 
03:40:10.370 --> 03:40:10.380 align:start position:0%
expectation is that they would work with
 
03:40:11.990 --> 03:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
us and provide us with their feedback
 
03:40:14.870 --> 03:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
but if they didn't the end result would
 
03:40:16.370 --> 03:40:16.380 align:start position:0%
be we would do it without them which is
 
03:40:17.389 --> 03:40:17.399 align:start position:0%
why I think they would probably
 
03:40:19.790 --> 03:40:19.800 align:start position:0%
participate and we would actually get a
 
03:40:19.800 --> 03:40:20.690 align:start position:0%
participate and we would actually get a
solution

03:40:20.690 --> 03:40:20.700 align:start position:0%
solution
 
03:40:23.750 --> 03:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
that I mean the fact that this this bill
 
03:40:26.450 --> 03:40:26.460 align:start position:0%
becoming the statute gives you a pretty
 
03:40:29.809 --> 03:40:29.819 align:start position:0%
big hammer uh and so uh as long as
 
03:40:31.870 --> 03:40:31.880 align:start position:0%
you're comfortable with the idea of
 
03:40:34.070 --> 03:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
proceeding you're going to be the
 
03:40:36.110 --> 03:40:36.120 align:start position:0%
executive director for another 15 20
 
03:40:37.910 --> 03:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
years right
 
03:40:40.130 --> 03:40:40.140 align:start position:0%
um so the bottom line is as I say with
 
03:40:42.349 --> 03:40:42.359 align:start position:0%
your legal background you're you're
 
03:40:45.170 --> 03:40:45.180 align:start position:0%
going to be have a different capacity
 
03:40:47.510 --> 03:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
than somebody who doesn't have that but
 
03:40:49.370 --> 03:40:49.380 align:start position:0%
if as long as you're comfortable with it
 
03:40:52.190 --> 03:40:52.200 align:start position:0%
that's important thank you and just for
 
03:40:53.990 --> 03:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
your awareness we're we're lining things
 
03:40:56.030 --> 03:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
up and establishing internal control so
 
03:40:58.370 --> 03:40:58.380 align:start position:0%
that the the management of the office is
 
03:41:01.429 --> 03:41:01.439 align:start position:0%
not reliant on one person so I I feel
 
03:41:02.990 --> 03:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
really confident with their ability to
 
03:41:04.849 --> 03:41:04.859 align:start position:0%
execute that and the only other thing
 
03:41:07.790 --> 03:41:07.800 align:start position:0%
representative if I may or Madam chair
 
03:41:09.410 --> 03:41:09.420 align:start position:0%
um with respect to
 
03:41:12.050 --> 03:41:12.060 align:start position:0%
um Miss Holland's testimony which I I
 
03:41:14.750 --> 03:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
very much appreciate I think the way I
 
03:41:16.370 --> 03:41:16.380 align:start position:0%
would interpret
 
03:41:18.229 --> 03:41:18.239 align:start position:0%
um the phrase substantially similar as I
 
03:41:20.090 --> 03:41:20.100 align:start position:0%
would actually exclude the New Hampshire
 
03:41:22.250 --> 03:41:22.260 align:start position:0%
real estate licensing requirements out
 
03:41:26.090 --> 03:41:26.100 align:start position:0%
of it so I I don't think that that the
 
03:41:28.190 --> 03:41:28.200 align:start position:0%
requirements in Massachusetts would be
 
03:41:29.929 --> 03:41:29.939 align:start position:0%
deemed substantially similar because
 
03:41:32.929 --> 03:41:32.939 align:start position:0%
there is a jurisprudence examination
 
03:41:35.690 --> 03:41:35.700 align:start position:0%
component that is based on different
 
03:41:35.700 --> 03:41:36.889 align:start position:0%
component that is based on different
laws

03:41:36.889 --> 03:41:36.899 align:start position:0%
laws
 
03:41:38.870 --> 03:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
um and so I don't believe that we would
 
03:41:41.570 --> 03:41:41.580 align:start position:0%
issue those types of licenses under this
 
03:41:44.750 --> 03:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
statute yes thank you I believe the the
 
03:41:47.630 --> 03:41:47.640 align:start position:0%
board of uh surveyors has the same
 
03:41:50.690 --> 03:41:50.700 align:start position:0%
situation yes certainly
 
03:41:53.630 --> 03:41:53.640 align:start position:0%
okay representative and thank you thank
 
03:41:55.729 --> 03:41:55.739 align:start position:0%
you um so since we never know what's
 
03:41:57.349 --> 03:41:57.359 align:start position:0%
going to happen to a bill
 
03:41:58.729 --> 03:41:58.739 align:start position:0%
um we don't know what will happen with
 
03:42:01.610 --> 03:42:01.620 align:start position:0%
this one if we were to move forward with
 
03:42:04.070 --> 03:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
409 and it were to pass and then this
 
03:42:05.630 --> 03:42:05.640 align:start position:0%
one were as well
 
03:42:08.090 --> 03:42:08.100 align:start position:0%
my reading is that it wouldn't be a
 
03:42:10.130 --> 03:42:10.140 align:start position:0%
problem uh this might override that one
 
03:42:12.530 --> 03:42:12.540 align:start position:0%
but do substantially the same thing so
 
03:42:15.170 --> 03:42:15.180 align:start position:0%
is that uh reasonable
 
03:42:17.929 --> 03:42:17.939 align:start position:0%
yes that would be my interpretation it
 
03:42:19.670 --> 03:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be modifying the same statute
 
03:42:22.670 --> 03:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
so we would just look to both and
 
03:42:25.490 --> 03:42:25.500 align:start position:0%
um harmonize the consistency to be the
 
03:42:25.500 --> 03:42:26.870 align:start position:0%
um harmonize the consistency to be the
broadest

03:42:26.870 --> 03:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
broadest
 
03:42:29.090 --> 03:42:29.100 align:start position:0%
um to apply the broadest interpretation
 
03:42:36.950 --> 03:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:39.590 --> 03:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
no I had had my hand raised but uh the
 
03:42:41.269 --> 03:42:41.279 align:start position:0%
director anticipated my question on the
 
03:42:43.250 --> 03:42:43.260 align:start position:0%
Realty board and answered that so I'm
 
03:42:46.250 --> 03:42:46.260 align:start position:0%
all set great okay excellent anyone else
 
03:42:47.809 --> 03:42:47.819 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
03:42:50.510 --> 03:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
03:42:53.690 --> 03:42:53.700 align:start position:0%
all right that's uh
 
03:42:55.729 --> 03:42:55.739 align:start position:0%
does anyone else wish to testify on
 
03:42:59.330 --> 03:42:59.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:02.090 --> 03:43:02.100 align:start position:0%
seeing anybody will close the hearing
 
03:43:05.929 --> 03:43:05.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:09.290 --> 03:43:09.300 align:start position:0%
so the question you a subcommittee was
 
03:43:11.809 --> 03:43:11.819 align:start position:0%
raised if you reached a decision on that
 
03:43:14.870 --> 03:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
or I I don't believe it needs to go to
 
03:43:17.690 --> 03:43:17.700 align:start position:0%
subcommittee we think we can discuss it
 
03:43:20.150 --> 03:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
in the executive session I I agree with
 
03:43:21.710 --> 03:43:21.720 align:start position:0%
that but I just wanted to have your
 
03:43:24.769 --> 03:43:24.779 align:start position:0%
deterior yeah I agree because uh it it
 
03:43:26.150 --> 03:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't sound like there's a need for an
 
03:43:27.469 --> 03:43:27.479 align:start position:0%
amendment which is what I was concerned
 
03:43:29.809 --> 03:43:29.819 align:start position:0%
about which is good
 
03:43:32.269 --> 03:43:32.279 align:start position:0%
in fact since we have 20 minutes do you
 
03:43:32.279 --> 03:43:33.050 align:start position:0%
in fact since we have 20 minutes do you
want

03:43:33.050 --> 03:43:33.060 align:start position:0%
want
 
03:43:37.309 --> 03:43:37.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:40.370 --> 03:43:40.380 align:start position:0%

03:43:52.130 --> 03:43:52.140 align:start position:0%
I I think we understand it and it
 
03:43:54.889 --> 03:43:54.899 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to need an amendment so
 
03:44:13.490 --> 03:44:13.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:13.500 --> 03:44:18.650 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:44:18.650 --> 03:44:18.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:18.660 --> 03:44:20.950 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:44:20.950 --> 03:44:20.960 align:start position:0%

else and it's at least reasonably uh
 
03:44:55.849 --> 03:44:55.859 align:start position:0%
similar requirements I don't see any
 
03:44:57.590 --> 03:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
reason why they should not be able to

regarding beauty shop licenses the bill
 
04:04:18.290 --> 04:04:18.300 align:start position:0%
this bill repeals the license
 
04:04:20.929 --> 04:04:20.939 align:start position:0%
requirement for individuals who
 
04:04:25.250 --> 04:04:25.260 align:start position:0%
independently operate booths attach to
 
04:04:28.610 --> 04:04:28.620 align:start position:0%
or within an already licensed Salon or
 
04:04:38.349 --> 04:04:38.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:41.030 --> 04:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
please please excuse us that's okay
 
04:04:52.610 --> 04:04:52.620 align:start position:0%

okay sorry would you like me to continue
 
04:04:58.550 --> 04:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
please Madam chair okay as you may be
 
04:05:00.889 --> 04:05:00.899 align:start position:0%
aware it's not uncommon for a
 
04:05:03.830 --> 04:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
hairdresser to rent a stall at a beauty
 
04:05:06.050 --> 04:05:06.060 align:start position:0%
shop owned and operated by another
 
04:05:09.229 --> 04:05:09.239 align:start position:0%
hairdresser often this occurs when the
 
04:05:12.950 --> 04:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
owner has extra chairs or sinks dryers
 
04:05:14.830 --> 04:05:14.840 align:start position:0%
or chairs
 
04:05:18.170 --> 04:05:18.180 align:start position:0%
other setups that the number of stylists
 
04:05:21.710 --> 04:05:21.720 align:start position:0%
she or he employees and wants to use and
 
04:05:24.170 --> 04:05:24.180 align:start position:0%
has extra to use to rent to defray the
 
04:05:26.210 --> 04:05:26.220 align:start position:0%
costs so it's usually a salon maybe
 
04:05:28.550 --> 04:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
there's six setups but she only has
 
04:05:30.410 --> 04:05:30.420 align:start position:0%
she's only employing maybe three
 
04:05:34.729 --> 04:05:34.739 align:start position:0%
stylists she may rent those other setups
 
04:05:38.030 --> 04:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
in my experience and I have frequented
 
04:05:40.250 --> 04:05:40.260 align:start position:0%
hair salons often over my years a
 
04:05:42.590 --> 04:05:42.600 align:start position:0%
customer cannot distinguish between the
 
04:05:46.070 --> 04:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
rented stalls and those which are owned
 
04:05:48.710 --> 04:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
and operated by the stud the the the
 
04:05:51.530 --> 04:05:51.540 align:start position:0%
owner of The Stylist at work it doesn't
 
04:05:53.990 --> 04:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
make much sense to require the rented
 
04:05:56.630 --> 04:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
stalls to have a separate shop license
 
04:05:59.269 --> 04:05:59.279 align:start position:0%
from the shop license already required
 
04:06:01.490 --> 04:06:01.500 align:start position:0%
of the owner of that shop
 
04:06:06.250 --> 04:06:06.260 align:start position:0%
and that that requirement is in RSA
 
04:06:10.790 --> 04:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
313-a colon a19 a colon 19.
 
04:06:13.969 --> 04:06:13.979 align:start position:0%
this bill also exempts three Niche
 
04:06:16.309 --> 04:06:16.319 align:start position:0%

moreover these occupational licensing

requirements disproportionately affect
 
04:07:38.450 --> 04:07:38.460 align:start position:0%
economically disadvantaged individuals
 
04:07:40.849 --> 04:07:40.859 align:start position:0%
the majority of whom are women
 
04:07:44.090 --> 04:07:44.100 align:start position:0%
we need to focus on making it easier for
 
04:07:46.790 --> 04:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
them to launch into a profession by

as far as the salons dedicated only to
 
04:07:56.870 --> 04:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
shampooing blow drying threading and
 
04:07:59.150 --> 04:07:59.160 align:start position:0%
makeup application these are very
 
04:08:01.729 --> 04:08:01.739 align:start position:0%

three these basic Niche Services which
 
04:08:09.889 --> 04:08:09.899 align:start position:0%
are inherently safe
 
04:08:12.650 --> 04:08:12.660 align:start position:0%
they do not use or store chemicals that
 
04:08:15.110 --> 04:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
permanently alter the shape or color of

Threading salons use cotton thread and

is the most ancient the safest and

natural forms of hair removal it does
 
04:08:27.469 --> 04:08:27.479 align:start position:0%

these specialty salons do not cut hair

nor do they use chemicals or dyes blow
 
04:08:53.809 --> 04:08:53.819 align:start position:0%
dry bars not to be confused with other
 
04:08:56.510 --> 04:08:56.520 align:start position:0%
common bars we may know of are no
 
04:08:58.990 --> 04:08:59.000 align:start position:0%
different than Hair Braiding salons
 
04:09:03.410 --> 04:09:03.420 align:start position:0%
which were Exempted in 2017 by the New

children do them without the requirement
 
04:09:26.450 --> 04:09:26.460 align:start position:0%
to go to school to learn them we should
 
04:09:30.050 --> 04:09:30.060 align:start position:0%
not require time intensive and expensive

requirements for someone who simply
 
04:09:35.929 --> 04:09:35.939 align:start position:0%
wants to do it for income so I recommend
 
04:09:39.290 --> 04:09:39.300 align:start position:0%
House Bill 644 ought to pass and I hope
 
04:09:42.110 --> 04:09:42.120 align:start position:0%

representative Lucas
 
04:09:52.250 --> 04:09:52.260 align:start position:0%
thank you my only question is if you
 
04:09:53.750 --> 04:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
have that testimonial written form and
 
04:09:55.250 --> 04:09:55.260 align:start position:0%

you could email I'll email it to correct
 
04:10:01.729 --> 04:10:01.739 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:10:01.739 --> 04:10:03.590 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

04:10:03.590 --> 04:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:10:04.969 --> 04:10:04.979 align:start position:0%
hi thank you
 
04:10:07.729 --> 04:10:07.739 align:start position:0%
I believe we heard this bill last year
 
04:10:09.590 --> 04:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
does it say something about eyelash
 
04:10:09.600 --> 04:10:11.090 align:start position:0%
does it say something about eyelash
extensions

04:10:11.090 --> 04:10:11.100 align:start position:0%
extensions
 
04:10:12.110 --> 04:10:12.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:10:14.150 --> 04:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
representative that was removed from
 
04:10:16.250 --> 04:10:16.260 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:10:19.130 --> 04:10:19.140 align:start position:0%
okay thank you yep so this bill says
 
04:10:21.950 --> 04:10:21.960 align:start position:0%
nothing whatsoever about eyelashes no um
 
04:10:24.889 --> 04:10:24.899 align:start position:0%
eyelash extensions do require an
 
04:10:26.990 --> 04:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
adhesive that's applied near the eye
 
04:10:29.809 --> 04:10:29.819 align:start position:0%
it's on the eyelash so there was concern
 
04:10:32.570 --> 04:10:32.580 align:start position:0%
last year that that was part of the bill
 
04:10:32.580 --> 04:10:33.769 align:start position:0%
last year that that was part of the bill
so

04:10:33.769 --> 04:10:33.779 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:10:36.050 --> 04:10:36.060 align:start position:0%
um representative power and and I had
 
04:10:37.490 --> 04:10:37.500 align:start position:0%
discussions with her about it last year
 
04:10:42.530 --> 04:10:42.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:45.110 --> 04:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
it's representative Gould
 
04:10:47.630 --> 04:10:47.640 align:start position:0%
if um if someone else is going to
 
04:10:49.070 --> 04:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
testify who could answer this better
 
04:10:51.229 --> 04:10:51.239 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:10:54.969 --> 04:10:54.979 align:start position:0%
um my question is in order to understand
 
04:10:58.130 --> 04:10:58.140 align:start position:0%
fully if you could explain the cotton
 
04:11:00.889 --> 04:11:00.899 align:start position:0%
threading of the eyebrow
 
04:11:02.630 --> 04:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
somebody could probably answer that I
 
04:11:05.210 --> 04:11:05.220 align:start position:0%
haven't I I use the dangerous tweezers
 
04:11:07.490 --> 04:11:07.500 align:start position:0%
so I don't really know about the cotton
 
04:11:09.229 --> 04:11:09.239 align:start position:0%
threading but I have heard it's very
 
04:11:11.389 --> 04:11:11.399 align:start position:0%
safe it's and it's an extremely old
 
04:11:18.050 --> 04:11:18.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:20.269 --> 04:11:20.279 align:start position:0%
representative true
 
04:11:22.070 --> 04:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
04:11:24.349 --> 04:11:24.359 align:start position:0%
taking my question and you'll see that I
 
04:11:26.210 --> 04:11:26.220 align:start position:0%
don't get out much
 
04:11:29.210 --> 04:11:29.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:34.370 --> 04:11:34.380 align:start position:0%
so uh a person would go to a salon and
 
04:11:36.469 --> 04:11:36.479 align:start position:0%
say I'm just here for a shampoo and blow
 
04:11:37.729 --> 04:11:37.739 align:start position:0%
dry my hair
 
04:11:37.739 --> 04:11:40.849 align:start position:0%
dry my hair
yes

04:11:40.849 --> 04:11:40.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:42.650 --> 04:11:42.660 align:start position:0%
but follow up
 
04:11:44.750 --> 04:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
and and
 
04:11:47.689 --> 04:11:47.699 align:start position:0%
this would not be at a hair salon where
 
04:11:49.309 --> 04:11:49.319 align:start position:0%
somebody's renting
 
04:11:51.830 --> 04:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
a booth and all they're doing at that
 
04:11:54.650 --> 04:11:54.660 align:start position:0%
Booth is shampooing and blow drying your
 
04:11:54.660 --> 04:11:55.790 align:start position:0%
Booth is shampooing and blow drying your
hair

04:11:55.790 --> 04:11:55.800 align:start position:0%
hair
 
04:11:58.309 --> 04:11:58.319 align:start position:0%
with this bill that is correct there
 
04:12:00.769 --> 04:12:00.779 align:start position:0%
could be someone someone let's say for
 
04:12:02.809 --> 04:12:02.819 align:start position:0%
yourself for example could go into a
 
04:12:05.929 --> 04:12:05.939 align:start position:0%
full-service Salon which is licensed and
 
04:12:08.630 --> 04:12:08.640 align:start position:0%
there may be a stylist there who's only
 
04:12:11.090 --> 04:12:11.100 align:start position:0%
job they're allowed to do without the
 
04:12:13.610 --> 04:12:13.620 align:start position:0%
license is I mean if this bill to Pat
 
04:12:15.469 --> 04:12:15.479 align:start position:0%
were to pass could all she could only or
 
04:12:17.689 --> 04:12:17.699 align:start position:0%
he could only shampoo and blow dry your
 
04:12:17.699 --> 04:12:19.010 align:start position:0%
he could only shampoo and blow dry your
hair

04:12:19.010 --> 04:12:19.020 align:start position:0%
hair
 
04:12:21.530 --> 04:12:21.540 align:start position:0%
thank you but presently that's not true
 
04:12:23.330 --> 04:12:23.340 align:start position:0%
someone that's only limited to those
 
04:12:25.849 --> 04:12:25.859 align:start position:0%
tasks could still be
 
04:12:28.010 --> 04:12:28.020 align:start position:0%
um does the state currently requires a
 
04:12:30.050 --> 04:12:30.060 align:start position:0%
license to do that
 
04:12:32.510 --> 04:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
but this would not prohibit a licensed
 
04:12:35.090 --> 04:12:35.100 align:start position:0%
cosmetologist from doing this should
 
04:12:38.030 --> 04:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
they choose correct and and thank you
 
04:12:40.429 --> 04:12:40.439 align:start position:0%
for that comment also it additionally if
 
04:12:41.450 --> 04:12:41.460 align:start position:0%
you look at it from a business
 
04:12:41.460 --> 04:12:43.250 align:start position:0%
you look at it from a business
perspective

04:12:43.250 --> 04:12:43.260 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
04:12:44.870 --> 04:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
um someone who's gone through that
 
04:12:46.969 --> 04:12:46.979 align:start position:0%
extensive training and to become a
 
04:12:49.610 --> 04:12:49.620 align:start position:0%
licensed cosmetologist
 
04:12:52.750 --> 04:12:52.760 align:start position:0%
um they have dispense part of their day
 
04:12:55.550 --> 04:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
shampooing and blow drying and if they
 
04:12:58.130 --> 04:12:58.140 align:start position:0%
were relieved of those very basic tasks
 
04:13:02.110 --> 04:13:02.120 align:start position:0%
they could get more value added
 
04:13:05.510 --> 04:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
opportunities value-added task to their
 
04:13:10.429 --> 04:13:10.439 align:start position:0%
day so it actually improves the value of
 
04:13:12.590 --> 04:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
the revenue that that Salon could do
 
04:13:14.870 --> 04:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
because they wouldn't have to have these
 
04:13:17.510 --> 04:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
trained licensed cosmetologists to do
 
04:13:19.550 --> 04:13:19.560 align:start position:0%
basic tasks they'd be freed up to do
 
04:13:21.410 --> 04:13:21.420 align:start position:0%
more complicated work
 
04:13:25.030 --> 04:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
okay representative a bear
 
04:13:27.670 --> 04:13:27.680 align:start position:0%
am I allowed to clarify that question
 
04:13:31.389 --> 04:13:31.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:34.070 --> 04:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
you want to make a statement
 
04:13:38.330 --> 04:13:38.340 align:start position:0%
um not normally no no okay thank you
 
04:13:40.370 --> 04:13:40.380 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:13:42.590 --> 04:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
we'll take it offline representative
 
04:13:42.600 --> 04:13:44.689 align:start position:0%
we'll take it offline representative
Broda

04:13:44.689 --> 04:13:44.699 align:start position:0%
Broda
 
04:13:47.750 --> 04:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
so by removing I guess it's a question
 
04:13:49.550 --> 04:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
for anybody who can answer it by
 
04:13:52.429 --> 04:13:52.439 align:start position:0%
removing arranging dressing curling
 
04:13:54.590 --> 04:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
waving cleansing
 
04:13:58.550 --> 04:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
from the definition of Cosmetology
 
04:14:01.130 --> 04:14:01.140 align:start position:0%
cutting bleaching coving killing
 
04:14:04.309 --> 04:14:04.319 align:start position:0%
chemically altering
 
04:14:06.349 --> 04:14:06.359 align:start position:0%
between the hair does that mean that
 
04:14:08.689 --> 04:14:08.699 align:start position:0%
cosmetologists can no longer arrange
 
04:14:11.330 --> 04:14:11.340 align:start position:0%
dress curl wave and cleanse hair
 
04:14:11.340 --> 04:14:12.769 align:start position:0%
dress curl wave and cleanse hair
no

04:14:12.769 --> 04:14:12.779 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:14:15.889 --> 04:14:15.899 align:start position:0%
to why we take it if it is if it is not
 
04:14:18.229 --> 04:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
you don't need a license for it then the
 
04:14:21.650 --> 04:14:21.660 align:start position:0%
cosmetologist can do it
 
04:14:25.189 --> 04:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
well I mean that's I think we're getting
 
04:14:27.769 --> 04:14:27.779 align:start position:0%
into uh I'm just clarifying we're not
 
04:14:29.389 --> 04:14:29.399 align:start position:0%
getting into anything I'm just clever I
 
04:14:31.610 --> 04:14:31.620 align:start position:0%
have no I I just want to understand this
 
04:14:33.950 --> 04:14:33.960 align:start position:0%
because this is something that we have
 
04:14:35.870 --> 04:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
had before us and I just want to make
 
04:14:37.790 --> 04:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
sure foreign
 
04:14:41.389 --> 04:14:41.399 align:start position:0%
yes representative Schmidt so is this
 
04:14:43.550 --> 04:14:43.560 align:start position:0%
going to a subcommittee it sounds like
 
04:14:45.889 --> 04:14:45.899 align:start position:0%
it needs to right okay because I don't
 
04:14:47.330 --> 04:14:47.340 align:start position:0%
think we should get into all this stuff
 
04:14:49.849 --> 04:14:49.859 align:start position:0%
but I I was also going to ask whether
 
04:14:53.090 --> 04:14:53.100 align:start position:0%
representative a bear could uh phrase a
 
04:14:54.889 --> 04:14:54.899 align:start position:0%
question that would bring out the kind
 
04:14:56.450 --> 04:14:56.460 align:start position:0%
of thing that you want to
 
04:14:58.309 --> 04:14:58.319 align:start position:0%
make a statement about maybe you could
 
04:15:02.030 --> 04:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
ask a question because this is an area
 
04:15:03.950 --> 04:15:03.960 align:start position:0%
as you can see that I'm not too very
 
04:15:07.189 --> 04:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
qualified in uh nor do I want to be for
 
04:15:09.950 --> 04:15:09.960 align:start position:0%
that matter but but I I do think that
 
04:15:12.050 --> 04:15:12.060 align:start position:0%
this is important because we're talking
 
04:15:14.229 --> 04:15:14.239 align:start position:0%
about businesses that are you know
 
04:15:18.590 --> 04:15:18.600 align:start position:0%
flourishing or uh or you know maybe not
 
04:15:21.110 --> 04:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
but they would like to so let's get it
 
04:15:21.120 --> 04:15:22.130 align:start position:0%
but they would like to so let's get it
right

04:15:22.130 --> 04:15:22.140 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:15:24.530 --> 04:15:24.540 align:start position:0%
all right thank you representative
 
04:15:26.990 --> 04:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
I have a question
 
04:15:27.000 --> 04:15:28.910 align:start position:0%
I have a question
so

04:15:28.910 --> 04:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:15:31.250 --> 04:15:31.260 align:start position:0%
a little Act of listening what you're
 
04:15:34.370 --> 04:15:34.380 align:start position:0%
saying is that someone who might be
 
04:15:37.429 --> 04:15:37.439 align:start position:0%
answering the phone only
 
04:15:40.969 --> 04:15:40.979 align:start position:0%
during a busy Salon time on a Saturday
 
04:15:44.650 --> 04:15:44.660 align:start position:0%
could prep somebody's hair by washing it
 
04:15:50.990 --> 04:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:51.000 --> 04:15:52.490 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:15:52.490 --> 04:15:52.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:56.450 --> 04:15:56.460 align:start position:0%
cosmetologist exactly so it allows the
 
04:16:00.650 --> 04:16:00.660 align:start position:0%
licensed cosmetology to work on tasks
 
04:16:02.870 --> 04:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
that require more training or that are
 
04:16:05.929 --> 04:16:05.939 align:start position:0%
handling chemicals that may need extra
 
04:16:07.610 --> 04:16:07.620 align:start position:0%
safety precautions that they've been
 
04:16:11.450 --> 04:16:11.460 align:start position:0%
trained to handle so somebody that's in
 
04:16:14.150 --> 04:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
the salon or student perhaps that isn't
 
04:16:16.729 --> 04:16:16.739 align:start position:0%
licensed yet would be able to shampoo
 
04:16:19.010 --> 04:16:19.020 align:start position:0%
and blow dry do those basic tasks to
 
04:16:20.870 --> 04:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
free up the time of the licensed
 
04:16:20.880 --> 04:16:22.250 align:start position:0%
free up the time of the licensed
cosmetologist

04:16:22.250 --> 04:16:22.260 align:start position:0%
cosmetologist
 
04:16:22.260 --> 04:16:23.750 align:start position:0%
cosmetologist
okay

04:16:23.750 --> 04:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:16:26.510 --> 04:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
all right representative Schmidt uh it
 
04:16:28.910 --> 04:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
seems to me that we've had situations in
 
04:16:32.809 --> 04:16:32.819 align:start position:0%
the past where we've been told that uh
 
04:16:36.349 --> 04:16:36.359 align:start position:0%
that some salons are offering free
 
04:16:39.290 --> 04:16:39.300 align:start position:0%
services and so forth uh and they're
 
04:16:41.330 --> 04:16:41.340 align:start position:0%
having them done by people who are not
 
04:16:45.950 --> 04:16:45.960 align:start position:0%
trained uh and uh is there not a danger
 
04:16:49.990 --> 04:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
that we will see abuse of this bill
 
04:16:54.050 --> 04:16:54.060 align:start position:0%
possibly by situations where some salons
 
04:16:57.229 --> 04:16:57.239 align:start position:0%
will advertise free services but they
 
04:17:00.590 --> 04:17:00.600 align:start position:0%
won't be performed by cosmetologists and
 
04:17:03.229 --> 04:17:03.239 align:start position:0%
other licensed Personnel they will be
 
04:17:06.170 --> 04:17:06.180 align:start position:0%
performed by people who've been hired to
 
04:17:06.180 --> 04:17:07.150 align:start position:0%
performed by people who've been hired to
be

04:17:07.150 --> 04:17:07.160 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:17:09.590 --> 04:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
receptionists or schedulers or whatever
 
04:17:12.530 --> 04:17:12.540 align:start position:0%
where they don't they don't have any
 
04:17:14.689 --> 04:17:14.699 align:start position:0%
training at all well thank you
 
04:17:17.150 --> 04:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
representative for that question I would
 
04:17:19.250 --> 04:17:19.260 align:start position:0%
imagine that if a business is offering
 
04:17:21.410 --> 04:17:21.420 align:start position:0%
free services performed by someone who's
 
04:17:23.450 --> 04:17:23.460 align:start position:0%
unlicensed for that task would be in
 
04:17:26.090 --> 04:17:26.100 align:start position:0%
violation of New Hampshire law
 
04:17:28.010 --> 04:17:28.020 align:start position:0%
um so they wouldn't be but if they're
 
04:17:29.450 --> 04:17:29.460 align:start position:0%
offering free services that are
 
04:17:30.469 --> 04:17:30.479 align:start position:0%
performed by somebody who doesn't
 
04:17:33.050 --> 04:17:33.060 align:start position:0%
require a license
 
04:17:35.030 --> 04:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
um I don't really see a problem with
 
04:17:37.729 --> 04:17:37.739 align:start position:0%
that I I also kind of correlate this if
 
04:17:41.389 --> 04:17:41.399 align:start position:0%
we look at the field of an electrician a
 
04:17:44.590 --> 04:17:44.600 align:start position:0%
master electrician can do anything
 
04:17:47.570 --> 04:17:47.580 align:start position:0%
that's needed to do for a wiring project
 
04:17:49.610 --> 04:17:49.620 align:start position:0%
whether it's industrial commercial or
 
04:17:52.370 --> 04:17:52.380 align:start position:0%
residential but there are certain tasks
 
04:17:55.969 --> 04:17:55.979 align:start position:0%
that involve wiring that can be done by
 
04:17:57.889 --> 04:17:57.899 align:start position:0%
someone who's not licensed it could be
 
04:18:01.010 --> 04:18:01.020 align:start position:0%
lining up the tools or purchasing the
 
04:18:03.769 --> 04:18:03.779 align:start position:0%
supplies removing
 
04:18:07.969 --> 04:18:07.979 align:start position:0%
um uh electrical plates you know if if
 
04:18:10.130 --> 04:18:10.140 align:start position:0%
we require a light a master election
 
04:18:12.769 --> 04:18:12.779 align:start position:0%
electrician to do all those tasks that's
 
04:18:16.490 --> 04:18:16.500 align:start position:0%
less time that they can devote to
 
04:18:19.729 --> 04:18:19.739 align:start position:0%
those tasks which actually require a
 
04:18:22.570 --> 04:18:22.580 align:start position:0%
higher level of training with this bill
 
04:18:24.950 --> 04:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
the the premise is that you don't
 
04:18:27.410 --> 04:18:27.420 align:start position:0%
require extensive training you're not
 
04:18:30.229 --> 04:18:30.239 align:start position:0%
posing a public health risk by having
 
04:18:32.630 --> 04:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
someone shampoo blow dry your hair or
 
04:18:38.870 --> 04:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:41.090 --> 04:18:41.100 align:start position:0%
for representative shouldn't we realize
 
04:18:43.550 --> 04:18:43.560 align:start position:0%
you're not a consumer representative
 
04:18:46.010 --> 04:18:46.020 align:start position:0%
Gerhard thank you madam chair just
 
04:18:47.809 --> 04:18:47.819 align:start position:0%
curiosity's sake has there ever been any
 
04:18:51.410 --> 04:18:51.420 align:start position:0%
instances of Barbers gone wrong and I
 
04:18:53.090 --> 04:18:53.100 align:start position:0%
mean just with shampooers is there any
 
04:18:54.590 --> 04:18:54.600 align:start position:0%
instance of people actually suffering
 
04:18:54.600 --> 04:18:56.750 align:start position:0%
instance of people actually suffering
from

04:18:56.750 --> 04:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:18:58.910 --> 04:18:58.920 align:start position:0%
unlicensed shampooers I'm just curious
 
04:19:00.469 --> 04:19:00.479 align:start position:0%
like is there
 
04:19:02.269 --> 04:19:02.279 align:start position:0%
um uh thank you for the question I'm not
 
04:19:05.150 --> 04:19:05.160 align:start position:0%
aware of any but as a customer of these
 
04:19:09.050 --> 04:19:09.060 align:start position:0%
Services even if I go into a shop where
 
04:19:11.330 --> 04:19:11.340 align:start position:0%
there is a licensed cosmetologist there
 
04:19:13.070 --> 04:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
may be some factors of that that I said
 
04:19:14.510 --> 04:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't really want to be there
 
04:19:16.370 --> 04:19:16.380 align:start position:0%
maybe just the style or maybe the
 
04:19:17.689 --> 04:19:17.699 align:start position:0%
product they're using is it something
 
04:19:20.689 --> 04:19:20.699 align:start position:0%
that I like so the customer still has a
 
04:19:22.610 --> 04:19:22.620 align:start position:0%
decision making it customers still can
 
04:19:25.910 --> 04:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
assess whether the shop they're going to
 
04:19:29.570 --> 04:19:29.580 align:start position:0%
the the cosmetologist maybe isn't
 
04:19:31.550 --> 04:19:31.560 align:start position:0%
practicing hygiene the way they should
 
04:19:33.349 --> 04:19:33.359 align:start position:0%
under a license but I think we have to
 
04:19:36.050 --> 04:19:36.060 align:start position:0%
give credit to the customer to assess a
 
04:19:38.210 --> 04:19:38.220 align:start position:0%
situation where they may be at risk
 
04:19:41.570 --> 04:19:41.580 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions thank you
 
04:19:42.889 --> 04:19:42.899 align:start position:0%
very much all right thank you very much
 
04:19:44.929 --> 04:19:44.939 align:start position:0%
and I will um distribute my written
 
04:19:46.670 --> 04:19:46.680 align:start position:0%
testimonial email it to the committee as
 
04:20:01.729 --> 04:20:01.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:03.229 --> 04:20:03.239 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
 
04:20:04.849 --> 04:20:04.859 align:start position:0%
committee always great to be back in
 
04:20:07.790 --> 04:20:07.800 align:start position:0%
ocdna uh for the record my name is Ross
 
04:20:09.769 --> 04:20:09.779 align:start position:0%
Connolly I'm the deputy state director
 
04:20:12.229 --> 04:20:12.239 align:start position:0%
for Americans for Prosperity here to
 
04:20:15.590 --> 04:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
voice our support for HB 644
 
04:20:17.990 --> 04:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
um as was mentioned this is a bill that
 
04:20:20.510 --> 04:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
uh should be familiar to the veterans of
 
04:20:23.389 --> 04:20:23.399 align:start position:0%
this committee it came up last year uh
 
04:20:25.670 --> 04:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
and passed overwhelmingly in the house
 
04:20:29.269 --> 04:20:29.279 align:start position:0%
and and uh a lot of the criticism of the
 
04:20:32.750 --> 04:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
bill in the Senate was around the uh the
 
04:20:35.330 --> 04:20:35.340 align:start position:0%
eyelash extensions so the compromise
 
04:20:37.729 --> 04:20:37.739 align:start position:0%
that that we came up in response uh to
 
04:20:40.429 --> 04:20:40.439 align:start position:0%
that was to remove that section uh since
 
04:20:43.550 --> 04:20:43.560 align:start position:0%
there there could be a a concern of of
 
04:20:43.560 --> 04:20:45.590 align:start position:0%
there there could be a a concern of of
adhesives

04:20:45.590 --> 04:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
adhesives
 
04:20:48.050 --> 04:20:48.060 align:start position:0%
um being used in that process but this
 
04:20:48.060 --> 04:20:49.309 align:start position:0%
um being used in that process but this
bill

04:20:49.309 --> 04:20:49.319 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:20:52.070 --> 04:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
um simply uh removes the license
 
04:20:54.650 --> 04:20:54.660 align:start position:0%
licensure requirement for styling hair
 
04:20:57.530 --> 04:20:57.540 align:start position:0%
and makeup application as well as those
 
04:20:59.750 --> 04:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh those separate booths within salons
 
04:21:01.010 --> 04:21:01.020 align:start position:0%
that was mentioned by the previous
 
04:21:01.020 --> 04:21:02.630 align:start position:0%
that was mentioned by the previous
speaker

04:21:02.630 --> 04:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
speaker
 
04:21:05.809 --> 04:21:05.819 align:start position:0%
um all of these these uh services are
 
04:21:08.450 --> 04:21:08.460 align:start position:0%
very low risk to the consumer it's just
 
04:21:10.490 --> 04:21:10.500 align:start position:0%
styling hair getting ready for a prom
 
04:21:13.130 --> 04:21:13.140 align:start position:0%
getting ready for a wedding getting your
 
04:21:15.110 --> 04:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
your hair styled obviously if you look
 
04:21:16.790 --> 04:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
at me I don't have much experience in
 
04:21:20.929 --> 04:21:20.939 align:start position:0%
this area but um it is a a very popular
 
04:21:23.330 --> 04:21:23.340 align:start position:0%
uh very popular service that's that's
 
04:21:26.090 --> 04:21:26.100 align:start position:0%
growing especially in States outside of
 
04:21:28.910 --> 04:21:28.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire as far as I know we do
 
04:21:31.610 --> 04:21:31.620 align:start position:0%
have two blow dry bars in in New
 
04:21:33.170 --> 04:21:33.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire one in Bedford I believe the
 
04:21:35.150 --> 04:21:35.160 align:start position:0%
others in Salem
 
04:21:38.150 --> 04:21:38.160 align:start position:0%
um but uh Hudson as representative
 
04:21:39.769 --> 04:21:39.779 align:start position:0%
lekkas points out
 
04:21:41.389 --> 04:21:41.399 align:start position:0%
um I I
 
04:21:43.790 --> 04:21:43.800 align:start position:0%
you know we if we want to see this
 
04:21:46.910 --> 04:21:46.920 align:start position:0%
industry grow uh it's really onerous to
 
04:21:49.790 --> 04:21:49.800 align:start position:0%
require these very Niche services to go
 
04:21:52.010 --> 04:21:52.020 align:start position:0%
through the thousands of hours it takes
 
04:21:55.189 --> 04:21:55.199 align:start position:0%
to get a cosmetology license the uh
 
04:21:57.769 --> 04:21:57.779 align:start position:0%
enormous expense of of getting uh of
 
04:22:00.590 --> 04:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
going to the school and and the expense
 
04:22:03.530 --> 04:22:03.540 align:start position:0%
of the license so uh we look at this
 
04:22:06.349 --> 04:22:06.359 align:start position:0%
very similar to when we supported the
 
04:22:08.330 --> 04:22:08.340 align:start position:0%
the bill that removed the requirement
 
04:22:12.349 --> 04:22:12.359 align:start position:0%
for hair braiders uh back in 2017 uh
 
04:22:14.389 --> 04:22:14.399 align:start position:0%
it's very similar very low risk to
 
04:22:17.990 --> 04:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
Consumers and uh and and could be a big
 
04:22:20.210 --> 04:22:20.220 align:start position:0%
economic boom for these these folks that
 
04:22:22.670 --> 04:22:22.680 align:start position:0%
maybe they want to uh get the full
 
04:22:25.490 --> 04:22:25.500 align:start position:0%
cosmetology license later on and and
 
04:22:27.889 --> 04:22:27.899 align:start position:0%
grow into the industry that this gives
 
04:22:30.110 --> 04:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
them a foothold to start earning money
 
04:22:33.170 --> 04:22:33.180 align:start position:0%
uh in this area and they can eventually
 
04:22:35.269 --> 04:22:35.279 align:start position:0%
afford the school if they want to
 
04:22:38.570 --> 04:22:38.580 align:start position:0%
provide the full Suite of services
 
04:22:41.090 --> 04:22:41.100 align:start position:0%
um so with that uh we think that this is
 
04:22:44.030 --> 04:22:44.040 align:start position:0%
a great legislation and and encourage
 
04:22:45.889 --> 04:22:45.899 align:start position:0%
the the committee to to move this bill
 
04:22:48.469 --> 04:22:48.479 align:start position:0%
out to pass and I'd be happy to take any
 
04:22:50.990 --> 04:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
questions if there are any
 
04:22:53.929 --> 04:22:53.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:56.330 --> 04:22:56.340 align:start position:0%
sure thank you madam chair so
 
04:22:58.070 --> 04:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
one of the things that has not really
 
04:23:00.410 --> 04:23:00.420 align:start position:0%
been discussed in our hearing thus far
 
04:23:03.769 --> 04:23:03.779 align:start position:0%
is a question of hygiene uh we've been
 
04:23:05.710 --> 04:23:05.720 align:start position:0%
talking about procedures
 
04:23:10.250 --> 04:23:10.260 align:start position:0%
but hygiene is a big deal uh whenever
 
04:23:12.889 --> 04:23:12.899 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with people handling
 
04:23:16.750 --> 04:23:16.760 align:start position:0%
other people's hair nails or whatever
 
04:23:19.910 --> 04:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
and and so what
 
04:23:24.710 --> 04:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
uh Provisions you see uh being
 
04:23:27.110 --> 04:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
influenced by this bill involving
 
04:23:29.210 --> 04:23:29.220 align:start position:0%
hygiene uh thank you for the question
 
04:23:31.670 --> 04:23:31.680 align:start position:0%
representative as uh representative
 
04:23:33.530 --> 04:23:33.540 align:start position:0%
wrong mentioned
 
04:23:35.570 --> 04:23:35.580 align:start position:0%
um this is a service most of these
 
04:23:38.990 --> 04:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
services are very obvious if there is a
 
04:23:42.110 --> 04:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
mistake uh the to the consumer the nails
 
04:23:44.090 --> 04:23:44.100 align:start position:0%
aren't painted right the the hair isn't
 
04:23:46.429 --> 04:23:46.439 align:start position:0%
styled right uh the greatest check on
 
04:23:49.130 --> 04:23:49.140 align:start position:0%
that is is the consumer not returning to
 
04:23:52.010 --> 04:23:52.020 align:start position:0%
that uh establishment so uh we believe
 
04:23:54.889 --> 04:23:54.899 align:start position:0%
that the market forces really protect
 
04:23:56.809 --> 04:23:56.819 align:start position:0%
the consumer the most in this area
 
04:23:59.929 --> 04:23:59.939 align:start position:0%
because there is not a an enormous risk
 
04:24:03.590 --> 04:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
of of bodily harm the biggest risk is is
 
04:24:07.010 --> 04:24:07.020 align:start position:0%
uh you know your your service not
 
04:24:09.290 --> 04:24:09.300 align:start position:0%
meeting the standards that that you want
 
04:24:12.469 --> 04:24:12.479 align:start position:0%
to be met so uh the consumer really has
 
04:24:14.750 --> 04:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of choice in this area follow-up
 
04:24:18.229 --> 04:24:18.239 align:start position:0%
well not coming back certainly is uh the
 
04:24:21.650 --> 04:24:21.660 align:start position:0%
the not the ultimate a slap in the face
 
04:24:26.269 --> 04:24:26.279 align:start position:0%
to the establishment of the the biggest
 
04:24:28.370 --> 04:24:28.380 align:start position:0%
slap in the face would be a lawsuit
 
04:24:30.469 --> 04:24:30.479 align:start position:0%
because they somebody did something
 
04:24:33.490 --> 04:24:33.500 align:start position:0%
wrong so the
 
04:24:36.530 --> 04:24:36.540 align:start position:0%
establishment suffers by the customer
 
04:24:38.330 --> 04:24:38.340 align:start position:0%
not coming back or something was done
 
04:24:42.469 --> 04:24:42.479 align:start position:0%
wrong but the customer is harmed
 
04:24:46.550 --> 04:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
potentially by that and so that's a
 
04:24:49.130 --> 04:24:49.140 align:start position:0%
concern I have with regard to whether
 
04:24:53.090 --> 04:24:53.100 align:start position:0%
you think you this is an area you have
 
04:24:54.889 --> 04:24:54.899 align:start position:0%
testified before so on a number of
 
04:24:58.729 --> 04:24:58.739 align:start position:0%
occasions previously so I are you
 
04:25:01.910 --> 04:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
satisfied that that this aspect of
 
04:25:04.670 --> 04:25:04.680 align:start position:0%
somebody who has potentially no training
 
04:25:07.550 --> 04:25:07.560 align:start position:0%
could be doing this kind of thing and in
 
04:25:10.309 --> 04:25:10.319 align:start position:0%
terms of hygiene which can you know
 
04:25:13.790 --> 04:25:13.800 align:start position:0%
conveys disease potentially uh thank you
 
04:25:16.429 --> 04:25:16.439 align:start position:0%
for the question representative I I we
 
04:25:18.769 --> 04:25:18.779 align:start position:0%
certainly believe so uh that the the
 
04:25:20.990 --> 04:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
risk is very low and for those those
 
04:25:23.330 --> 04:25:23.340 align:start position:0%
larger risks whether it's fraud or
 
04:25:26.689 --> 04:25:26.699 align:start position:0%
damages actual they find a way to to
 
04:25:30.050 --> 04:25:30.060 align:start position:0%
make bodily harm that those things are
 
04:25:33.349 --> 04:25:33.359 align:start position:0%
still able to to go through a a civil
 
04:25:36.229 --> 04:25:36.239 align:start position:0%
suit process there would be a an ability
 
04:25:39.229 --> 04:25:39.239 align:start position:0%
to to get restitution and very extreme
 
04:25:39.239 --> 04:25:41.149 align:start position:0%
to to get restitution and very extreme
circumstances

04:25:41.149 --> 04:25:41.159 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
04:25:43.610 --> 04:25:43.620 align:start position:0%
um you know the license requirement is
 
04:25:45.410 --> 04:25:45.420 align:start position:0%
really a threat that will take away the
 
04:25:48.950 --> 04:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
license uh so those those other avenues
 
04:25:51.229 --> 04:25:51.239 align:start position:0%
still exist it's just the the
 
04:25:53.630 --> 04:25:53.640 align:start position:0%
requirement for the licensure is is
 
04:25:58.610 --> 04:25:58.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:01.130 --> 04:26:01.140 align:start position:0%
earlier today uh thank you for taking my
 
04:26:03.830 --> 04:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chair
 
04:26:08.030 --> 04:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
um use electricians as the example I
 
04:26:10.670 --> 04:26:10.680 align:start position:0%
could go to work for an electrician as a
 
04:26:13.429 --> 04:26:13.439 align:start position:0%
journeyman or Apprentice yet I am
 
04:26:15.649 --> 04:26:15.659 align:start position:0%
working underneath that patrician's
 
04:26:15.659 --> 04:26:16.550 align:start position:0%
working underneath that patrician's
license

04:26:16.550 --> 04:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
license
 
04:26:18.950 --> 04:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
if my
 
04:26:18.960 --> 04:26:19.689 align:start position:0%
if my
um

04:26:19.689 --> 04:26:19.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:26:22.729 --> 04:26:22.739 align:start position:0%
performance was substandard okay it
 
04:26:25.550 --> 04:26:25.560 align:start position:0%
caused a particular issue that comes to
 
04:26:28.210 --> 04:26:28.220 align:start position:0%
the responsibility of the master
 
04:26:30.469 --> 04:26:30.479 align:start position:0%
licensed technician
 
04:26:33.290 --> 04:26:33.300 align:start position:0%
you're talking about computer uh
 
04:26:36.469 --> 04:26:36.479 align:start position:0%
consumer protection I just don't show up
 
04:26:39.110 --> 04:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
you get a bad haircut don't show up but
 
04:26:41.090 --> 04:26:41.100 align:start position:0%
what happens if something more serious
 
04:26:44.210 --> 04:26:44.220 align:start position:0%
uh why not having uh is there any
 
04:26:47.750 --> 04:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
guaranteed a shop owner or anybody there
 
04:26:50.149 --> 04:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
are you working why wouldn't you have it
 
04:26:52.429 --> 04:26:52.439 align:start position:0%
that they're working under that person's
 
04:26:54.290 --> 04:26:54.300 align:start position:0%
particular ticket
 
04:26:55.910 --> 04:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:26:58.070 --> 04:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
representative if I'm right or is this
 
04:27:02.030 --> 04:27:02.040 align:start position:0%
in reference to the the salon a booth uh
 
04:27:05.450 --> 04:27:05.460 align:start position:0%
so that that's obviously
 
04:27:08.269 --> 04:27:08.279 align:start position:0%
um you're working in a licensed Salon in
 
04:27:11.090 --> 04:27:11.100 align:start position:0%
that instance uh and you have that
 
04:27:13.490 --> 04:27:13.500 align:start position:0%
oversight uh we think that's very
 
04:27:16.309 --> 04:27:16.319 align:start position:0%
appropriate that person can again grow
 
04:27:19.490 --> 04:27:19.500 align:start position:0%
into the industry learn uh real skills
 
04:27:22.790 --> 04:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
in in real time uh so that we think
 
04:27:25.189 --> 04:27:25.199 align:start position:0%
that's a very appropriate check on on
 
04:27:27.769 --> 04:27:27.779 align:start position:0%
that similar to to electricians when it
 
04:27:30.769 --> 04:27:30.779 align:start position:0%
comes to the niche Beauty Services
 
04:27:33.530 --> 04:27:33.540 align:start position:0%
um you know if if someone messes up your
 
04:27:35.689 --> 04:27:35.699 align:start position:0%
your electrical work there could be
 
04:27:38.149 --> 04:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
serious consequences
 
04:27:40.729 --> 04:27:40.739 align:start position:0%
um I I am not an expert in in doing
 
04:27:42.830 --> 04:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
electrical work I usually have my
 
04:27:46.689 --> 04:27:46.699 align:start position:0%
brother or somebody do that but um I the
 
04:27:49.969 --> 04:27:49.979 align:start position:0%
I do style hair I do it every morning I
 
04:27:52.610 --> 04:27:52.620 align:start position:0%
comb it not very well but I think most
 
04:27:55.250 --> 04:27:55.260 align:start position:0%
most people are proficient in that area
 
04:27:57.530 --> 04:27:57.540 align:start position:0%
and and that's the area where we think
 
04:27:59.929 --> 04:27:59.939 align:start position:0%
that the market forces
 
04:28:03.830 --> 04:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
um are are a good solution to to uh you
 
04:28:05.389 --> 04:28:05.399 align:start position:0%
know bad performance
 
04:28:07.250 --> 04:28:07.260 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
04:28:09.710 --> 04:28:09.720 align:start position:0%
um I'm not very comfortable with having
 
04:28:12.410 --> 04:28:12.420 align:start position:0%
the market determine it as compared to
 
04:28:15.050 --> 04:28:15.060 align:start position:0%
having some form of Regulation and
 
04:28:17.330 --> 04:28:17.340 align:start position:0%
there's nothing I see in there like you
 
04:28:20.689 --> 04:28:20.699 align:start position:0%
make the suggestion that it could happen
 
04:28:23.330 --> 04:28:23.340 align:start position:0%
but there's nothing in the law that says
 
04:28:26.229 --> 04:28:26.239 align:start position:0%
that you must be under the supervision
 
04:28:30.610 --> 04:28:30.620 align:start position:0%
of a licensed cosmetologist am I correct
 
04:28:34.670 --> 04:28:34.680 align:start position:0%
in order to style hair correct right and
 
04:28:36.769 --> 04:28:36.779 align:start position:0%
I also do a good job on my own with my
 
04:28:38.570 --> 04:28:38.580 align:start position:0%
hair thank you
 
04:28:41.210 --> 04:28:41.220 align:start position:0%
thank you representative O'Brien Brook
 
04:28:43.370 --> 04:28:43.380 align:start position:0%
Senator Fitzpatrick
 
04:28:45.769 --> 04:28:45.779 align:start position:0%
like my colleague to the left I have
 
04:28:49.250 --> 04:28:49.260 align:start position:0%
very limited experience in any of this
 
04:28:49.260 --> 04:28:50.330 align:start position:0%
very limited experience in any of this
but

04:28:50.330 --> 04:28:50.340 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:28:52.189 --> 04:28:52.199 align:start position:0%
I would like
 
04:28:55.969 --> 04:28:55.979 align:start position:0%
I'm sympathetic to your argument but
 
04:28:59.030 --> 04:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
could you give me some ease of of that
 
04:29:02.030 --> 04:29:02.040 align:start position:0%
by describing to me what tools do the
 
04:29:04.910 --> 04:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
people use when they're performing these
 
04:29:04.920 --> 04:29:06.710 align:start position:0%
people use when they're performing these
services

04:29:06.710 --> 04:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
services
 
04:29:08.809 --> 04:29:08.819 align:start position:0%
I I'm thank you for the question
 
04:29:10.370 --> 04:29:10.380 align:start position:0%
representative I might not be the best
 
04:29:12.410 --> 04:29:12.420 align:start position:0%
person to answer this question I I'd
 
04:29:14.510 --> 04:29:14.520 align:start position:0%
probably defer to those those behind me
 
04:29:17.809 --> 04:29:17.819 align:start position:0%
uh who have more expertise in in this
 
04:29:20.030 --> 04:29:20.040 align:start position:0%
this actual field
 
04:29:22.910 --> 04:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
um you know again we look at it as there
 
04:29:26.510 --> 04:29:26.520 align:start position:0%
there are alternatives to licensure that
 
04:29:28.070 --> 04:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
still exist whether that's through
 
04:29:30.349 --> 04:29:30.359 align:start position:0%
Insurance whether that's through uh
 
04:29:34.550 --> 04:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
inspections or or uh Market forces and
 
04:29:37.429 --> 04:29:37.439 align:start position:0%
and for a very very low risk industry
 
04:29:40.189 --> 04:29:40.199 align:start position:0%
we're talking about styling hair things
 
04:29:41.990 --> 04:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
that in Massachusetts you know
 
04:29:43.550 --> 04:29:43.560 align:start position:0%
surrounding states have lower
 
04:29:46.010 --> 04:29:46.020 align:start position:0%
requirements for and there are growing
 
04:29:47.570 --> 04:29:47.580 align:start position:0%
number of states that require no
 
04:29:49.729 --> 04:29:49.739 align:start position:0%
licensure for for these particular
 
04:29:51.710 --> 04:29:51.720 align:start position:0%
services so
 
04:29:54.530 --> 04:29:54.540 align:start position:0%
um those are sort of our take on just as
 
04:29:56.149 --> 04:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
a fault but we're not talking about
 
04:30:03.010 --> 04:30:03.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:05.809 --> 04:30:05.819 align:start position:0%
something totally different it's combing
 
04:30:08.570 --> 04:30:08.580 align:start position:0%
styling gelling uh and cleaning here
 
04:30:11.090 --> 04:30:11.100 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you thank you any
 
04:30:12.610 --> 04:30:12.620 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
04:30:15.229 --> 04:30:15.239 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
04:30:17.330 --> 04:30:17.340 align:start position:0%
so let's say you go to The Styling bar
 
04:30:19.729 --> 04:30:19.739 align:start position:0%
and you get your hair done and the
 
04:30:21.469 --> 04:30:21.479 align:start position:0%
customer says William
 
04:30:22.910 --> 04:30:22.920 align:start position:0%
do you think you can make my hair a
 
04:30:24.189 --> 04:30:24.199 align:start position:0%
little shorter
 
04:30:26.929 --> 04:30:26.939 align:start position:0%
what's gonna happen
 
04:30:28.189 --> 04:30:28.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:30:30.170 --> 04:30:30.180 align:start position:0%
representative if if they actually
 
04:30:32.689 --> 04:30:32.699 align:start position:0%
perform the cutting of the hair at a
 
04:30:33.830 --> 04:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
Blow Dry Bar
 
04:30:36.590 --> 04:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
that would be a violation of of New
 
04:30:37.790 --> 04:30:37.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law
 
04:30:40.790 --> 04:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:43.370 --> 04:30:43.380 align:start position:0%
they're going to be verified
 
04:30:46.130 --> 04:30:46.140 align:start position:0%
thank you for for the question again I I
 
04:30:46.140 --> 04:30:47.990 align:start position:0%
thank you for for the question again I I
think

04:30:47.990 --> 04:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
think
 
04:30:51.649 --> 04:30:51.659 align:start position:0%
there is still oversight in this and
 
04:30:54.110 --> 04:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
since these services do still fall under
 
04:30:56.450 --> 04:30:56.460 align:start position:0%
the cosmetology board
 
04:30:58.429 --> 04:30:58.439 align:start position:0%
um you do not need to be licensed for it
 
04:31:01.550 --> 04:31:01.560 align:start position:0%
but there there would be my
 
04:31:02.870 --> 04:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
understanding there would still be
 
04:31:05.929 --> 04:31:05.939 align:start position:0%
oversight and again uh there there's
 
04:31:08.809 --> 04:31:08.819 align:start position:0%
very little check currently on you know
 
04:31:11.090 --> 04:31:11.100 align:start position:0%
whether a manicurist is doing things
 
04:31:12.830 --> 04:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
that they're they're they're not
 
04:31:16.790 --> 04:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
supposed to the you know people violate
 
04:31:19.610 --> 04:31:19.620 align:start position:0%
the law uh that but what we're trying to
 
04:31:23.330 --> 04:31:23.340 align:start position:0%
do is just legalize uh these Services uh
 
04:31:26.510 --> 04:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
without a license and and it's it should
 
04:31:28.429 --> 04:31:28.439 align:start position:0%
is very low risk
 
04:31:31.250 --> 04:31:31.260 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
04:31:33.649 --> 04:31:33.659 align:start position:0%
so if one of these if an individual will
 
04:31:36.110 --> 04:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to open a space up and do this
 
04:31:36.120 --> 04:31:37.670 align:start position:0%
wanted to open a space up and do this
themselves

04:31:37.670 --> 04:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
04:31:42.469 --> 04:31:42.479 align:start position:0%
outside of Epsilon could they do that
 
04:31:45.769 --> 04:31:45.779 align:start position:0%
if they wanted to open up a blow dry bar
 
04:31:49.370 --> 04:31:49.380 align:start position:0%
yes that's the the real purpose of of
 
04:31:55.729 --> 04:31:55.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:57.769 --> 04:31:57.779 align:start position:0%
because current currently you need to
 
04:32:02.389 --> 04:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
get a 1500 plus hours of training uh you
 
04:32:04.309 --> 04:32:04.319 align:start position:0%
have to spend between eight to forty
 
04:32:06.710 --> 04:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars on school
 
04:32:09.469 --> 04:32:09.479 align:start position:0%
um just to if if you wanted to only
 
04:32:12.830 --> 04:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
provide the service of of cut of styling
 
04:32:14.870 --> 04:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
and cleaning hair
 
04:32:17.570 --> 04:32:17.580 align:start position:0%
which in our mind is is quite onerous
 
04:32:21.830 --> 04:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:26.030 --> 04:32:26.040 align:start position:0%
I I think that the um blow dry bars that
 
04:32:27.769 --> 04:32:27.779 align:start position:0%
you're you're seeing pop up and I have
 
04:32:29.330 --> 04:32:29.340 align:start position:0%
seen the one in Hudson I have not seen
 
04:32:30.710 --> 04:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
the other one
 
04:32:34.729 --> 04:32:34.739 align:start position:0%
um it is the same terminology as an updo
 
04:32:36.469 --> 04:32:36.479 align:start position:0%
it's no different than an updo there's
 
04:32:38.990 --> 04:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
no cutting there's no dying there's no
 
04:32:42.410 --> 04:32:42.420 align:start position:0%
coloring there's no shaving there's
 
04:32:45.290 --> 04:32:45.300 align:start position:0%
there it's literally wet your hair
 
04:32:47.570 --> 04:32:47.580 align:start position:0%
shampoo your hair put some product in
 
04:32:49.189 --> 04:32:49.199 align:start position:0%
and blow dry it the same you would do it
 
04:32:54.050 --> 04:32:54.060 align:start position:0%
home other than like there's no epoxies
 
04:32:57.469 --> 04:32:57.479 align:start position:0%
there's it's just an it's just an updo
 
04:32:59.870 --> 04:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
I'm on my way out for the night and
 
04:33:02.269 --> 04:33:02.279 align:start position:0%
that's it is that correct correct it's
 
04:33:05.209 --> 04:33:05.219 align:start position:0%
it's uh something most of us do maybe
 
04:33:08.449 --> 04:33:08.459 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt um aside uh you
 
04:33:10.310 --> 04:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
know what most of us do every single
 
04:33:10.320 --> 04:33:11.330 align:start position:0%
know what most of us do every single
morning

04:33:11.330 --> 04:33:11.340 align:start position:0%
morning
 
04:33:16.551 --> 04:33:16.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:20.209 --> 04:33:20.219 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:23.209 --> 04:33:23.219 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that uh
 
04:33:26.269 --> 04:33:26.279 align:start position:0%
common and cosmetology population that
 
04:33:28.429 --> 04:33:28.439 align:start position:0%
would use this service or not maybe not
 
04:33:30.650 --> 04:33:30.660 align:start position:0%
predominantly anymore but anyway elderly
 
04:33:33.051 --> 04:33:33.061 align:start position:0%
people who have trouble raising their
 
04:33:35.869 --> 04:33:35.879 align:start position:0%
arms what have you so an alternative to
 
04:33:41.029 --> 04:33:41.039 align:start position:0%
going to a bar would be what maybe
 
04:33:43.551 --> 04:33:43.561 align:start position:0%
a home health care Aid coming into the
 
04:33:45.349 --> 04:33:45.359 align:start position:0%
home to shampoo
 
04:33:48.289 --> 04:33:48.299 align:start position:0%
elderly people's hair
 
04:33:50.869 --> 04:33:50.879 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question yeah
 
04:33:53.449 --> 04:33:53.459 align:start position:0%
current currently I I had a grandparent
 
04:33:56.090 --> 04:33:56.100 align:start position:0%
in a nursing home for many years that I
 
04:33:58.750 --> 04:33:58.760 align:start position:0%
looked after and and they would have a a
 
04:34:01.551 --> 04:34:01.561 align:start position:0%
barber or cosmetologist come to the the
 
04:34:03.650 --> 04:34:03.660 align:start position:0%
facility but certainly this would help
 
04:34:06.230 --> 04:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
in providing more options for those
 
04:34:08.330 --> 04:34:08.340 align:start position:0%
folks that might be disabled and can't
 
04:34:10.910 --> 04:34:10.920 align:start position:0%
do that do it themselves follow-up and
 
04:34:12.709 --> 04:34:12.719 align:start position:0%
do you know what kind of cosmetology
 
04:34:16.670 --> 04:34:16.680 align:start position:0%
training a home health aide has to wash
 
04:34:19.970 --> 04:34:19.980 align:start position:0%
elderly people's hair I I do not
 
04:34:23.510 --> 04:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
none none most likely
 
04:34:25.730 --> 04:34:25.740 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
04:34:27.830 --> 04:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
yes representative Gerhart thank you
 
04:34:29.209 --> 04:34:29.219 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
04:34:30.650 --> 04:34:30.660 align:start position:0%
do you
 
04:34:32.631 --> 04:34:32.641 align:start position:0%
from if you would agree with this or not
 
04:34:34.910 --> 04:34:34.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure but in a situation like
 
04:34:36.650 --> 04:34:36.660 align:start position:0%
this would you see a voluntary
 
04:34:38.929 --> 04:34:38.939 align:start position:0%
Association or trade Association forming
 
04:34:42.051 --> 04:34:42.061 align:start position:0%
just to certify the members of if it was
 
04:34:43.789 --> 04:34:43.799 align:start position:0%
absent if there was no licensure like
 
04:34:45.289 --> 04:34:45.299 align:start position:0%
for instance in my experience when I was
 
04:34:46.970 --> 04:34:46.980 align:start position:0%
younger working in New York City doing
 
04:34:49.070 --> 04:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
Bridge painting I was like one of the
 
04:34:51.410 --> 04:34:51.420 align:start position:0%
inspectors as a kid at 18 insane but all
 
04:34:52.789 --> 04:34:52.799 align:start position:0%
you have to do is decide for protective
 
04:34:54.709 --> 04:34:54.719 align:start position:0%
Coatings had a certification process do
 
04:34:56.570 --> 04:34:56.580 align:start position:0%
a test and you're done there's no State
 
04:34:58.670 --> 04:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
Licensing and you're you know that
 
04:35:00.170 --> 04:35:00.180 align:start position:0%
that's a serious project there's a lot
 
04:35:02.330 --> 04:35:02.340 align:start position:0%
of risk involved so do you think that
 
04:35:04.189 --> 04:35:04.199 align:start position:0%
that the industry itself would form that
 
04:35:05.810 --> 04:35:05.820 align:start position:0%
in order to protect its reputation or
 
04:35:07.789 --> 04:35:07.799 align:start position:0%
how do you see that playing out uh thank
 
04:35:10.131 --> 04:35:10.141 align:start position:0%
you for the question representative uh I
 
04:35:12.470 --> 04:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
I do not know if there is an industry
 
04:35:14.990 --> 04:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
you know group that does Private
 
04:35:17.170 --> 04:35:17.180 align:start position:0%
certifications optional certifications
 
04:35:20.269 --> 04:35:20.279 align:start position:0%
uh maybe one of the the speakers behind
 
04:35:23.510 --> 04:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
me does uh but you know voluntary
 
04:35:26.090 --> 04:35:26.100 align:start position:0%
certification license and and licensure
 
04:35:29.631 --> 04:35:29.641 align:start position:0%
is something that uh is is a solution in
 
04:35:31.929 --> 04:35:31.939 align:start position:0%
many different Industries series I know
 
04:35:34.970 --> 04:35:34.980 align:start position:0%
scuba divers do not have a license it's
 
04:35:37.551 --> 04:35:37.561 align:start position:0%
a private certification so that's
 
04:35:40.131 --> 04:35:40.141 align:start position:0%
usually especially for for some of the
 
04:35:42.709 --> 04:35:42.719 align:start position:0%
other industries that may pose a little
 
04:35:44.689 --> 04:35:44.699 align:start position:0%
more risk than just styling hair or
 
04:35:46.609 --> 04:35:46.619 align:start position:0%
painting nails
 
04:35:50.631 --> 04:35:50.641 align:start position:0%
um that that is is a a good safety check
 
04:35:52.970 --> 04:35:52.980 align:start position:0%
um you know I I don't know if it'd be
 
04:35:55.490 --> 04:35:55.500 align:start position:0%
exactly necessary for for this and I'm
 
04:35:58.250 --> 04:35:58.260 align:start position:0%
I'm unfortunately not able to fully
 
04:35:59.631 --> 04:35:59.641 align:start position:0%
answer your question whether that exists
 
04:36:01.250 --> 04:36:01.260 align:start position:0%
or not
 
04:36:02.990 --> 04:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
yes represent
 
04:36:05.029 --> 04:36:05.039 align:start position:0%
um Mr Connolly I'd like to mention that
 
04:36:08.390 --> 04:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
nails are not mentioned because dealing
 
04:36:11.029 --> 04:36:11.039 align:start position:0%
with nail polish involves a significant
 
04:36:13.570 --> 04:36:13.580 align:start position:0%
number of nasty chemicals
 
04:36:16.010 --> 04:36:16.020 align:start position:0%
and Sharp Tools
 
04:36:19.070 --> 04:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
so that's not included
 
04:36:22.070 --> 04:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
so anyone other questions all right
 
04:36:24.410 --> 04:36:24.420 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much Sophia
 
04:36:24.420 --> 04:36:27.890 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much Sophia

04:44:01.070 --> 04:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
University
 
04:44:02.570 --> 04:44:02.580 align:start position:0%
the main takeaways of my comments are
 
04:44:03.650 --> 04:44:03.660 align:start position:0%
the following
 
04:44:05.510 --> 04:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
verses that licensing is not always the
 
04:44:06.708 --> 04:44:06.718 align:start position:0%
appropriate form of Professional
 
04:44:06.718 --> 04:44:07.910 align:start position:0%
appropriate form of Professional
Regulation

04:44:07.910 --> 04:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
Regulation
 
04:44:09.530 --> 04:44:09.540 align:start position:0%
second is that Licensing in New
 
04:44:11.628 --> 04:44:11.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire reduces economic mobility and
 
04:44:13.970 --> 04:44:13.980 align:start position:0%
helps contribute to income inequality
 
04:44:15.890 --> 04:44:15.900 align:start position:0%
and finally more than 20 states have
 
04:44:17.690 --> 04:44:17.700 align:start position:0%
removed licensing requirements for one
 
04:44:19.010 --> 04:44:19.020 align:start position:0%
of the niche Beauty professions that's
 
04:44:21.288 --> 04:44:21.298 align:start position:0%
proposed in this bill
 
04:44:23.390 --> 04:44:23.400 align:start position:0%
so occupational licensing is one of the
 
04:44:24.650 --> 04:44:24.660 align:start position:0%
most common forms of Professional
 
04:44:26.208 --> 04:44:26.218 align:start position:0%
Regulation but it's also one of the most
 
04:44:26.218 --> 04:44:27.288 align:start position:0%
Regulation but it's also one of the most
stringent

04:44:27.288 --> 04:44:27.298 align:start position:0%
stringent
 
04:44:28.670 --> 04:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
so these laws prevent New Hampshire
 
04:44:30.230 --> 04:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
residents from working in a profession
 
04:44:32.390 --> 04:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
until they meet certain entry
 
04:44:33.890 --> 04:44:33.900 align:start position:0%
requirements which include education
 
04:44:36.170 --> 04:44:36.180 align:start position:0%
training and passing exams
 
04:44:37.670 --> 04:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
licensing is designed to protect
 
04:44:39.410 --> 04:44:39.420 align:start position:0%
consumers from harm from low-skilled
 
04:44:41.930 --> 04:44:41.940 align:start position:0%
professionals and I agree with with
 
04:44:43.310 --> 04:44:43.320 align:start position:0%
everyone here that this is an important
 
04:44:43.320 --> 04:44:44.448 align:start position:0%
everyone here that this is an important
goal

04:44:44.448 --> 04:44:44.458 align:start position:0%
goal
 
04:44:46.190 --> 04:44:46.200 align:start position:0%
however licensing is not the only form
 
04:44:47.810 --> 04:44:47.820 align:start position:0%
of Regulation that we could turn to to
 
04:44:49.730 --> 04:44:49.740 align:start position:0%
protect consumers
 
04:44:51.890 --> 04:44:51.900 align:start position:0%
so Langston can be costly and we have to
 
04:44:53.330 --> 04:44:53.340 align:start position:0%
weigh both the costs and the benefits of
 
04:44:55.368 --> 04:44:55.378 align:start position:0%
Licensing the Licensing Laws create
 
04:44:56.750 --> 04:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
barriers to entry and make it more
 
04:44:59.030 --> 04:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
difficult to enter a profession economic
 
04:45:00.530 --> 04:45:00.540 align:start position:0%
research estimates that licensing
 
04:45:02.150 --> 04:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
reduces the number of professionals by
 
04:45:05.030 --> 04:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
up to 27 in a licensed field
 
04:45:06.530 --> 04:45:06.540 align:start position:0%
there's many professions that do not
 
04:45:08.090 --> 04:45:08.100 align:start position:0%
require traditional four-year college
 
04:45:10.430 --> 04:45:10.440 align:start position:0%
degree that do require a professional
 
04:45:10.440 --> 04:45:11.390 align:start position:0%
degree that do require a professional
license

04:45:11.390 --> 04:45:11.400 align:start position:0%
license
 
04:45:13.368 --> 04:45:13.378 align:start position:0%
these professions offer a meaningful
 
04:45:15.170 --> 04:45:15.180 align:start position:0%
Avenue for employment for non-college
 
04:45:17.270 --> 04:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
graduates that is if they can afford to
 
04:45:19.788 --> 04:45:19.798 align:start position:0%
meet the licensing requirements
 
04:45:21.470 --> 04:45:21.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunately because of the time and
 
04:45:22.788 --> 04:45:22.798 align:start position:0%
money it takes for training and
 
04:45:24.770 --> 04:45:24.780 align:start position:0%
education many are unable to enter these
 
04:45:24.780 --> 04:45:25.670 align:start position:0%
education many are unable to enter these
professions

04:45:25.670 --> 04:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
professions
 
04:45:28.368 --> 04:45:28.378 align:start position:0%
oh research Bears this out um in a study
 
04:45:30.288 --> 04:45:30.298 align:start position:0%
published a few years ago
 
04:45:32.570 --> 04:45:32.580 align:start position:0%
research um yes they found that
 
04:45:33.730 --> 04:45:33.740 align:start position:0%
Licensing Laws in New Hampshire
 
04:45:36.050 --> 04:45:36.060 align:start position:0%
increased income inequality by six
 
04:45:37.910 --> 04:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
percent and decreased economic Mobility
 
04:45:39.288 --> 04:45:39.298 align:start position:0%
by three percent so they made it that
 
04:45:40.610 --> 04:45:40.620 align:start position:0%
much harder to you know achieve the
 
04:45:42.830 --> 04:45:42.840 align:start position:0%
American dream
 
04:45:44.510 --> 04:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
Niche Beauty Services which include
 
04:45:46.070 --> 04:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
shampooing hair styling makeup
 
04:45:47.690 --> 04:45:47.700 align:start position:0%
application eyebrow threading these
 
04:45:49.550 --> 04:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
types of services provide a good example
 
04:45:50.990 --> 04:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
of this problem
 
04:45:53.270 --> 04:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
so economists consistently find evidence
 
04:45:55.190 --> 04:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
that Licensing Laws act as a barrier to
 
04:45:57.230 --> 04:45:57.240 align:start position:0%
entry into the beauty professions
 
04:45:59.208 --> 04:45:59.218 align:start position:0%
while licensing may be worthwhile to
 
04:46:00.590 --> 04:46:00.600 align:start position:0%
protect consumers from the potential
 
04:46:02.390 --> 04:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
harms from things like the chemicals
 
04:46:04.850 --> 04:46:04.860 align:start position:0%
used by Barbers and cosmetologists Niche
 
04:46:06.708 --> 04:46:06.718 align:start position:0%
Beauty Services don't pose these same
 
04:46:08.330 --> 04:46:08.340 align:start position:0%
risks to Consumers
 
04:46:10.368 --> 04:46:10.378 align:start position:0%
so requiring cosmetology licensing for
 
04:46:12.350 --> 04:46:12.360 align:start position:0%
hair styling or shampooing or an
 
04:46:13.610 --> 04:46:13.620 align:start position:0%
esthetician license for things like
 
04:46:15.530 --> 04:46:15.540 align:start position:0%
makeup application and eyebrow threading
 
04:46:17.570 --> 04:46:17.580 align:start position:0%
imposes all the costs of Licensing that
 
04:46:19.868 --> 04:46:19.878 align:start position:0%
upfront investment in these Education
 
04:46:22.970 --> 04:46:22.980 align:start position:0%
meeting those education requirements and
 
04:46:25.550 --> 04:46:25.560 align:start position:0%
gives consumers none or very few of the
 
04:46:27.530 --> 04:46:27.540 align:start position:0%
benefits additionally these education
 
04:46:29.448 --> 04:46:29.458 align:start position:0%
programs cover far more information that
 
04:46:32.570 --> 04:46:32.580 align:start position:0%
is necessary to perform these tasks
 
04:46:34.430 --> 04:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
allowing each Beauty services to be
 
04:46:35.868 --> 04:46:35.878 align:start position:0%
performed without a license would make
 
04:46:37.490 --> 04:46:37.500 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire one of the leaders in New
 
04:46:38.868 --> 04:46:38.878 align:start position:0%
England and in the broader Northeast
 
04:46:40.910 --> 04:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
region but you wouldn't be going out on
 
04:46:43.128 --> 04:46:43.138 align:start position:0%
a limb according to this super Justice
 
04:46:44.448 --> 04:46:44.458 align:start position:0%
eight other states have removed
 
04:46:46.430 --> 04:46:46.440 align:start position:0%
licensing requirements to provide at
 
04:46:48.110 --> 04:46:48.120 align:start position:0%
least one Niche Beauty service in the
 
04:46:49.788 --> 04:46:49.798 align:start position:0%
past few years
 
04:46:51.890 --> 04:46:51.900 align:start position:0%
currently 21 states exempt eyebrow
 
04:46:53.590 --> 04:46:53.600 align:start position:0%
threaders from the esthetician license
 
04:46:56.628 --> 04:46:56.638 align:start position:0%
in 14 States makeup artists are exempt
 
04:46:59.390 --> 04:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
from licensing and 18 states explicitly
 
04:47:01.310 --> 04:47:01.320 align:start position:0%
exempt shampooers and hair stylists from
 
04:47:04.010 --> 04:47:04.020 align:start position:0%
the cosmetology license
 
04:47:05.750 --> 04:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
since removing the licensing requirement
 
04:47:07.070 --> 04:47:07.080 align:start position:0%
for these Niche Beauty professions
 
04:47:09.350 --> 04:47:09.360 align:start position:0%
States haven't experienced a surge in
 
04:47:11.690 --> 04:47:11.700 align:start position:0%
consumer injuries so far we see no
 
04:47:13.610 --> 04:47:13.620 align:start position:0%
evidence of lower quality services being
 
04:47:15.770 --> 04:47:15.780 align:start position:0%
provided or consumer harms resulting
 
04:47:18.350 --> 04:47:18.360 align:start position:0%
from the licensure and we also don't see
 
04:47:20.150 --> 04:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
consumer advocacy groups calling for
 
04:47:20.160 --> 04:47:22.010 align:start position:0%
consumer advocacy groups calling for
re-licensure

04:47:22.010 --> 04:47:22.020 align:start position:0%
re-licensure
 
04:47:24.050 --> 04:47:24.060 align:start position:0%
additionally no states have decided to
 
04:47:25.788 --> 04:47:25.798 align:start position:0%
re-licens the practice since removing
 
04:47:25.798 --> 04:47:27.350 align:start position:0%
re-licens the practice since removing
licensing

04:47:27.350 --> 04:47:27.360 align:start position:0%
licensing
 
04:47:29.030 --> 04:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
so although Licensing Laws are designed
 
04:47:30.530 --> 04:47:30.540 align:start position:0%
to protect consumers from harm they're
 
04:47:31.730 --> 04:47:31.740 align:start position:0%
not always the appropriate form of
 
04:47:34.010 --> 04:47:34.020 align:start position:0%
regulations to achieve those goals for
 
04:47:35.810 --> 04:47:35.820 align:start position:0%
Niche Beauty Services consumers face
 
04:47:38.628 --> 04:47:38.638 align:start position:0%
little risk of injury or harm however
 
04:47:40.610 --> 04:47:40.620 align:start position:0%
both consumers and the aspiring Beauty
 
04:47:42.708 --> 04:47:42.718 align:start position:0%
professionals still face the full cost
 
04:47:45.288 --> 04:47:45.298 align:start position:0%
of licensure so New Hampshire has the
 
04:47:47.330 --> 04:47:47.340 align:start position:0%
opportunity to grow and join a growing
 
04:47:49.010 --> 04:47:49.020 align:start position:0%
number of states to remove unnecessary
 
04:47:50.930 --> 04:47:50.940 align:start position:0%
licensing requirements for these safe
 
04:47:52.850 --> 04:47:52.860 align:start position:0%
Niche Beauty professions

thank you ma'am sure you mentioned
 
04:48:05.948 --> 04:48:05.958 align:start position:0%
eyebrow threading I thought that was not
 
04:48:09.850 --> 04:48:09.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:12.650 --> 04:48:12.660 align:start position:0%
eyelashes are not involved here
 
04:48:14.868 --> 04:48:14.878 align:start position:0%
and he used the term eyebrow threading
 
04:48:17.990 --> 04:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
that is specifically allowed yes okay
 
04:48:21.050 --> 04:48:21.060 align:start position:0%
and what is eyebrow threaded
 
04:48:21.060 --> 04:48:22.628 align:start position:0%
and what is eyebrow threaded
that

04:48:22.628 --> 04:48:22.638 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:48:24.830 --> 04:48:24.840 align:start position:0%
is that
 
04:48:28.610 --> 04:48:28.620 align:start position:0%
the proximity to the eyes is troubling I
 
04:48:31.430 --> 04:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
can help yes representative can answer
 
04:48:34.010 --> 04:48:34.020 align:start position:0%
your question
 
04:48:34.020 --> 04:48:38.450 align:start position:0%
your question
please

[Music]

04:48:42.850 --> 04:48:42.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:45.650 --> 04:48:45.660 align:start position:0%
well I've never had it done nor have I
 
04:48:48.170 --> 04:48:48.180 align:start position:0%
ever done it but you use Twisted threads
 
04:48:50.390 --> 04:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
and you pull them
 
04:48:53.330 --> 04:48:53.340 align:start position:0%
through your eyebrows and instead of
 
04:48:56.090 --> 04:48:56.100 align:start position:0%
plucking your eyebrow with a tweezer it
 
04:48:57.110 --> 04:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
takes the
 
04:48:57.120 --> 04:48:58.010 align:start position:0%
takes the
um

04:48:58.010 --> 04:48:58.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:00.050 --> 04:49:00.060 align:start position:0%
I bet you never knew
 
04:49:04.310 --> 04:49:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:06.288 --> 04:49:06.298 align:start position:0%
when it comes to eyebrows but anyway
 
04:49:07.970 --> 04:49:07.980 align:start position:0%
that's what it is it doesn't use any
 
04:49:10.070 --> 04:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
sharp input it's just a thread a twisted
 
04:49:12.650 --> 04:49:12.660 align:start position:0%
thread that's used and it's pulled and
 
04:49:15.288 --> 04:49:15.298 align:start position:0%
it pulls the aisle the um extra whatever
 
04:49:17.090 --> 04:49:17.100 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to pull out of your
 
04:49:17.100 --> 04:49:18.288 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to pull out of your
eyebrow

04:49:18.288 --> 04:49:18.298 align:start position:0%
eyebrow
 
04:49:20.810 --> 04:49:20.820 align:start position:0%
but you have magnificent eyebrows and I
 
04:49:23.330 --> 04:49:23.340 align:start position:0%
would say that you shouldn't touch them
 
04:49:23.340 --> 04:49:24.650 align:start position:0%
would say that you shouldn't touch them
foreign

04:49:24.650 --> 04:49:24.660 align:start position:0%
foreign

thank you for the opportunity to testify
 
04:50:31.970 --> 04:50:31.980 align:start position:0%
in support of House Bill 644 which would
 
04:50:33.708 --> 04:50:33.718 align:start position:0%
create more jobs and opportunities for
 
04:50:36.110 --> 04:50:36.120 align:start position:0%
aspiring Beauty entrepreneurs my name is
 
04:50:37.788 --> 04:50:37.798 align:start position:0%
Jessica Patois and I am legislative
 
04:50:40.128 --> 04:50:40.138 align:start position:0%
council with the institute for justice
 
04:50:41.990 --> 04:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
The Institute for justice is a national
 
04:50:43.970 --> 04:50:43.980 align:start position:0%
nonprofit organization that advocates
 
04:50:45.708 --> 04:50:45.718 align:start position:0%
for civil liberties including economic
 
04:50:47.868 --> 04:50:47.878 align:start position:0%
Liberty for nearly 30 years we have
 
04:50:49.490 --> 04:50:49.500 align:start position:0%
helped reform beauty industry laws in
 
04:50:51.288 --> 04:50:51.298 align:start position:0%
over 24 States through litigation and
 
04:50:52.850 --> 04:50:52.860 align:start position:0%
legislative efforts
 
04:50:54.830 --> 04:50:54.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's Beauty Industries ripe
 
04:50:56.868 --> 04:50:56.878 align:start position:0%
with opportunity but current Licensing
 
04:50:58.550 --> 04:50:58.560 align:start position:0%
Laws shut people out of jobs
 
04:51:00.170 --> 04:51:00.180 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire requires Beauty service
 
04:51:01.670 --> 04:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
professionals to have one of the big
 
04:51:03.530 --> 04:51:03.540 align:start position:0%
three licenses which includes the
 
04:51:05.750 --> 04:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
cosmetology or barber license and an
 
04:51:07.670 --> 04:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
esthetician's license or a manicurist
 
04:51:07.680 --> 04:51:08.570 align:start position:0%
esthetician's license or a manicurist
license

04:51:08.570 --> 04:51:08.580 align:start position:0%
license
 
04:51:10.910 --> 04:51:10.920 align:start position:0%
grouping all Beauty Services into one of
 
04:51:12.650 --> 04:51:12.660 align:start position:0%
these three overbought licenses does not
 
04:51:14.270 --> 04:51:14.280 align:start position:0%
work for an industry that is based on
 
04:51:16.670 --> 04:51:16.680 align:start position:0%
creativity and evolving techniques our
 
04:51:18.708 --> 04:51:18.718 align:start position:0%
data licensing requirements also Force
 
04:51:20.390 --> 04:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
Beauty professionals into time-consuming
 
04:51:22.010 --> 04:51:22.020 align:start position:0%
and costly traditional cosmetology
 
04:51:24.650 --> 04:51:24.660 align:start position:0%
programs even when those programs do not
 
04:51:26.208 --> 04:51:26.218 align:start position:0%
teach the services that aspiring
 
04:51:28.550 --> 04:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
professionals would like to offer
 
04:51:31.250 --> 04:51:31.260 align:start position:0%
traditional cosmetology Licensing Laws
 
04:51:32.390 --> 04:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
prevent Niche Beauty service
 
04:51:33.948 --> 04:51:33.958 align:start position:0%
professionals from entering into the
 
04:51:33.958 --> 04:51:35.030 align:start position:0%
professionals from entering into the
industry

04:51:35.030 --> 04:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
industry
 
04:51:36.708 --> 04:51:36.718 align:start position:0%
as you've heard today the niche Beauty
 
04:51:39.050 --> 04:51:39.060 align:start position:0%
service profession professions that are
 
04:51:41.448 --> 04:51:41.458 align:start position:0%
covered in 644 include blow dry styling
 
04:51:43.610 --> 04:51:43.620 align:start position:0%
makeup application and threading and I'm
 
04:51:45.910 --> 04:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
happy to provide a more detailed
 
04:51:47.868 --> 04:51:47.878 align:start position:0%
explanation of what all three of those
 
04:51:49.150 --> 04:51:49.160 align:start position:0%
services are
 
04:51:52.970 --> 04:51:52.980 align:start position:0%
during The Question portion of this
 
04:51:55.430 --> 04:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
hearing these services are different
 
04:51:57.110 --> 04:51:57.120 align:start position:0%
than the big three licenses because they
 
04:51:59.270 --> 04:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
do not use dangerous tools chemicals or
 
04:52:01.368 --> 04:52:01.378 align:start position:0%
dyes they are limited in scope of
 
04:52:03.470 --> 04:52:03.480 align:start position:0%
practice and Niche Beauty professionals
 
04:52:05.690 --> 04:52:05.700 align:start position:0%
train outside of traditional cosmetology
 
04:52:08.270 --> 04:52:08.280 align:start position:0%
programs so instead of cosmetologists
 
04:52:10.310 --> 04:52:10.320 align:start position:0%
who go to school to learn how to do all
 
04:52:12.350 --> 04:52:12.360 align:start position:0%
of the beauty Services these individuals
 
04:52:14.090 --> 04:52:14.100 align:start position:0%
do not learn their skills in those
 
04:52:15.470 --> 04:52:15.480 align:start position:0%
programs they actually learn them
 
04:52:17.810 --> 04:52:17.820 align:start position:0%
outside of those programs
 
04:52:20.030 --> 04:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
typically through private certifications
 
04:52:22.250 --> 04:52:22.260 align:start position:0%
or apprenticeship models things things
 
04:52:24.230 --> 04:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
of that nature
 
04:52:27.110 --> 04:52:27.120 align:start position:0%
even if they do even if cosmetology
 
04:52:28.970 --> 04:52:28.980 align:start position:0%
schools do teach these programs like
 
04:52:31.250 --> 04:52:31.260 align:start position:0%
some teach basic makeup Artistry that's
 
04:52:32.750 --> 04:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
exactly what it is they teach it at a
 
04:52:34.190 --> 04:52:34.200 align:start position:0%
very rudimentary level these
 
04:52:35.868 --> 04:52:35.878 align:start position:0%
professionals gain their skills and they
 
04:52:37.430 --> 04:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
improve on their skills
 
04:52:39.170 --> 04:52:39.180 align:start position:0%
um by either undergoing private
 
04:52:41.448 --> 04:52:41.458 align:start position:0%
certification or apprenticeship or
 
04:52:42.590 --> 04:52:42.600 align:start position:0%
working under
 
04:52:44.570 --> 04:52:44.580 align:start position:0%
um uh you know like a beauty master or
 
04:52:46.310 --> 04:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
04:52:47.570 --> 04:52:47.580 align:start position:0%
the average student in New Hampshire
 
04:52:49.310 --> 04:52:49.320 align:start position:0%
takes out seventy three hundred dollars
 
04:52:50.868 --> 04:52:50.878 align:start position:0%
worth of federal student loans to
 
04:52:52.850 --> 04:52:52.860 align:start position:0%
complete their first program and most
 
04:52:55.850 --> 04:52:55.860 align:start position:0%
students do not graduate on time in 2016
 
04:52:58.670 --> 04:52:58.680 align:start position:0%
through 2017 only about 19 of
 
04:53:00.410 --> 04:53:00.420 align:start position:0%
Cosmetology students graduated on time
 
04:53:01.490 --> 04:53:01.500 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
04:53:03.230 --> 04:53:03.240 align:start position:0%
their peers were forced to incur even
 
04:53:05.090 --> 04:53:05.100 align:start position:0%
more debt to finish this training
 
04:53:06.708 --> 04:53:06.718 align:start position:0%
the result being that many Niche Beauty
 
04:53:08.270 --> 04:53:08.280 align:start position:0%
professionals work in underground
 
04:53:10.368 --> 04:53:10.378 align:start position:0%
economies where they face exploitation
 
04:53:12.650 --> 04:53:12.660 align:start position:0%
or they continue to incur insurmountable
 
04:53:14.690 --> 04:53:14.700 align:start position:0%
debt to complete that training
 
04:53:16.070 --> 04:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
without giving them any additional
 
04:53:18.350 --> 04:53:18.360 align:start position:0%
benefit nor providing consumers with any
 
04:53:19.730 --> 04:53:19.740 align:start position:0%
additional benefit
 
04:53:22.250 --> 04:53:22.260 align:start position:0%
House Bill 644 is a solution for
 
04:53:24.530 --> 04:53:24.540 align:start position:0%
aspiring Beauty professionals based off
 
04:53:26.448 --> 04:53:26.458 align:start position:0%
of proven methods of Reform that have
 
04:53:28.010 --> 04:53:28.020 align:start position:0%
created jobs and opportunities in other
 
04:53:28.020 --> 04:53:29.270 align:start position:0%
created jobs and opportunities in other
states

04:53:29.270 --> 04:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
states
 
04:53:30.890 --> 04:53:30.900 align:start position:0%
I encourage this committee to support
 
04:53:33.288 --> 04:53:33.298 align:start position:0%
this bill for three reasons first as I
 
04:53:35.208 --> 04:53:35.218 align:start position:0%
mentioned before Niche Beauty services
 
04:53:37.610 --> 04:53:37.620 align:start position:0%
are safe blow dry styling makeup
 
04:53:39.170 --> 04:53:39.180 align:start position:0%
application and threading pose virtually
 
04:53:41.270 --> 04:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
no risk to Consumers I work on this
 
04:53:42.830 --> 04:53:42.840 align:start position:0%
piece or on this type of legislation
 
04:53:45.610 --> 04:53:45.620 align:start position:0%
across the country and I have not yet
 
04:53:48.470 --> 04:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
seen an enforcement about one of these
 
04:53:50.810 --> 04:53:50.820 align:start position:0%
Beauty service providers harming someone
 
04:53:54.708 --> 04:53:54.718 align:start position:0%
in our facility that um uh related to uh
 
04:53:56.510 --> 04:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
you know uh
 
04:53:58.910 --> 04:53:58.920 align:start position:0%
a negative enforcement action related to
 
04:54:00.350 --> 04:54:00.360 align:start position:0%
a facility for one of these service
 
04:54:03.288 --> 04:54:03.298 align:start position:0%
providers instead they typically
 
04:54:05.090 --> 04:54:05.100 align:start position:0%
um if there is an enforcement action
 
04:54:06.350 --> 04:54:06.360 align:start position:0%
taken against them it's because these
 
04:54:07.550 --> 04:54:07.560 align:start position:0%
individuals are working without a
 
04:54:09.770 --> 04:54:09.780 align:start position:0%
license which is exactly what this bill
 
04:54:12.230 --> 04:54:12.240 align:start position:0%
um Works to solve
 
04:54:13.788 --> 04:54:13.798 align:start position:0%
um second most States already exempt
 
04:54:15.230 --> 04:54:15.240 align:start position:0%
Niche Beauty services from licensing
 
04:54:18.110 --> 04:54:18.120 align:start position:0%
requirements Mr Norris before uh explain
 
04:54:19.788 --> 04:54:19.798 align:start position:0%
or shared with you some of those
 
04:54:21.948 --> 04:54:21.958 align:start position:0%
statistics but I'm happy to go into
 
04:54:25.070 --> 04:54:25.080 align:start position:0%
greater detail about about that and then
 
04:54:27.368 --> 04:54:27.378 align:start position:0%
third house bill 644 is a job spell
 
04:54:29.750 --> 04:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
reducing licensing barriers for aspiring
 
04:54:31.490 --> 04:54:31.500 align:start position:0%
Beauty professionals
 
04:54:34.670 --> 04:54:34.680 align:start position:0%
um is is an important part of keeping
 
04:54:37.368 --> 04:54:37.378 align:start position:0%
workers in the state I recently learned
 
04:54:39.170 --> 04:54:39.180 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire over the last three
 
04:54:41.150 --> 04:54:41.160 align:start position:0%
years has lost 200 licensed Beauty
 
04:54:44.030 --> 04:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
professionals this bill would allow
 
04:54:45.650 --> 04:54:45.660 align:start position:0%
individuals to be able to stay in the
 
04:54:47.090 --> 04:54:47.100 align:start position:0%
state and to work and to use the skills
 
04:54:48.590 --> 04:54:48.600 align:start position:0%
that they have to be able to to live
 
04:54:51.770 --> 04:54:51.780 align:start position:0%
here and earn a living additionally this
 
04:54:53.690 --> 04:54:53.700 align:start position:0%
bill is based off a proven reform that
 
04:54:56.030 --> 04:54:56.040 align:start position:0%
has seen success in other states for
 
04:54:57.770 --> 04:54:57.780 align:start position:0%
example after Minnesota pass its
 
04:54:59.448 --> 04:54:59.458 align:start position:0%
freelance hair styling and makeup
 
04:55:02.510 --> 04:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
license bill in 2020 there were about a
 
04:55:04.250 --> 04:55:04.260 align:start position:0%
thousand Bridal and hair makeup artists
 
04:55:05.570 --> 04:55:05.580 align:start position:0%
that were free to legitimately work
 
04:55:07.850 --> 04:55:07.860 align:start position:0%
within the state when Arkansas passed a
 
04:55:10.610 --> 04:55:10.620 align:start position:0%
similar bill in 2021 the first dry bar
 
04:55:12.110 --> 04:55:12.120 align:start position:0%
which is a national franchise size of
 
04:55:15.190 --> 04:55:15.200 align:start position:0%
blow dry bars opened opened in the state
 
04:55:17.868 --> 04:55:17.878 align:start position:0%
additionally House Bill 644 mostly
 
04:55:19.368 --> 04:55:19.378 align:start position:0%
benefits lower to Middle income women
 
04:55:20.868 --> 04:55:20.878 align:start position:0%
who do not have the time money or
 
04:55:22.368 --> 04:55:22.378 align:start position:0%
resources to attend traditional
 
04:55:24.170 --> 04:55:24.180 align:start position:0%
cosmetology programs
 
04:55:25.910 --> 04:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
finally this bill allows citizens from
 
04:55:27.230 --> 04:55:27.240 align:start position:0%
across the state to benefit from the
 
04:55:28.490 --> 04:55:28.500 align:start position:0%
wealth of new talent and Beauty
 
04:55:29.990 --> 04:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
techniques that are currently difficult
 
04:55:30.948 --> 04:55:30.958 align:start position:0%
to find
 
04:55:33.470 --> 04:55:33.480 align:start position:0%
in conclusion I encourage the submittee
 
04:55:35.690 --> 04:55:35.700 align:start position:0%
this committee to support House Bill 644
 
04:55:37.670 --> 04:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
it's about aspiring Beauty entrepreneurs
 
04:55:39.410 --> 04:55:39.420 align:start position:0%
have every opportunity to work and
 
04:55:41.090 --> 04:55:41.100 align:start position:0%
Thrive here in New Hampshire thank you
 
04:55:43.010 --> 04:55:43.020 align:start position:0%
for the opportunity to testify and and
 
04:55:44.390 --> 04:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any questions that
 
04:55:45.590 --> 04:55:45.600 align:start position:0%
you may have
 
04:55:49.070 --> 04:55:49.080 align:start position:0%
oh thank you are there any questions
 
04:55:52.310 --> 04:55:52.320 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt
 
04:55:55.128 --> 04:55:55.138 align:start position:0%
so I'm intrigued by the use of the word
 
04:55:59.510 --> 04:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
underground economy here this is in New
 
04:56:01.190 --> 04:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire talking about perhaps you
 
04:56:02.690 --> 04:56:02.700 align:start position:0%
could talk to us a little bit more about
 
04:56:05.570 --> 04:56:05.580 align:start position:0%
this the underground economy where this
 
04:56:07.730 --> 04:56:07.740 align:start position:0%
is happening
 
04:56:10.070 --> 04:56:10.080 align:start position:0%
of course I'm happy
 
04:56:12.230 --> 04:56:12.240 align:start position:0%
people would be um Sophie who
 
04:56:14.930 --> 04:56:14.940 align:start position:0%
lived here earlier today
 
04:56:17.150 --> 04:56:17.160 align:start position:0%
hair braider in in New Hampshire but she
 
04:56:18.410 --> 04:56:18.420 align:start position:0%
also would like to provide makeup
 
04:56:20.448 --> 04:56:20.458 align:start position:0%
Artistry services and things like that
 
04:56:23.750 --> 04:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
so as the law currently stands she is
 
04:56:25.970 --> 04:56:25.980 align:start position:0%
not able to practice makeup Artistry and
 
04:56:28.910 --> 04:56:28.920 align:start position:0%
get paid for it so she uses the loophole
 
04:56:31.310 --> 04:56:31.320 align:start position:0%
that exists where she can provide makeup
 
04:56:32.930 --> 04:56:32.940 align:start position:0%
artist services and not get paid for it
 
04:56:37.090 --> 04:56:37.100 align:start position:0%
legally or she has to work underground
 
04:56:40.010 --> 04:56:40.020 align:start position:0%
and not and technically provide those
 
04:56:42.410 --> 04:56:42.420 align:start position:0%
Services illegally even though she's
 
04:56:44.570 --> 04:56:44.580 align:start position:0%
doing the exact same thing I also wanted
 
04:56:46.190 --> 04:56:46.200 align:start position:0%
to mention I think that there was a
 
04:56:49.070 --> 04:56:49.080 align:start position:0%
question earlier about nursing homes
 
04:56:51.170 --> 04:56:51.180 align:start position:0%
um and individuals related to hair
 
04:56:52.970 --> 04:56:52.980 align:start position:0%
styling there's currently an exemption
 
04:56:54.350 --> 04:56:54.360 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire law that allows
 
04:56:56.930 --> 04:56:56.940 align:start position:0%
individuals to do any cosmetology
 
04:57:00.590 --> 04:57:00.600 align:start position:0%
service in nursing homes or in in homes
 
04:57:03.410 --> 04:57:03.420 align:start position:0%
with someone who's immobile to be able
 
04:57:06.650 --> 04:57:06.660 align:start position:0%
to to provide those Services now as as a
 
04:57:09.110 --> 04:57:09.120 align:start position:0%
current exemption
 
04:57:13.850 --> 04:57:13.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:18.470 --> 04:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:45.410 --> 04:57:45.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:47.390 --> 04:57:47.400 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and honorable
 
04:57:50.390 --> 04:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
committee members I'm truly
 
04:57:53.090 --> 04:57:53.100 align:start position:0%
um glad to be here to be able to testify
 
04:57:56.270 --> 04:57:56.280 align:start position:0%
on my bill unfortunately I was unable to
 
04:57:58.430 --> 04:57:58.440 align:start position:0%
introduce the bill because I've been an
 
04:58:00.830 --> 04:58:00.840 align:start position:0%
executive session in my committee
 
04:58:02.448 --> 04:58:02.458 align:start position:0%
Municipal and County government since
 
04:58:03.830 --> 04:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
this morning
 
04:58:06.410 --> 04:58:06.420 align:start position:0%
so thankfully we ended and I was able to
 
04:58:09.350 --> 04:58:09.360 align:start position:0%
catch the end of this hearing so for the
 
04:58:12.110 --> 04:58:12.120 align:start position:0%
record I am representative Diane power I
 
04:58:14.208 --> 04:58:14.218 align:start position:0%
represent the towns of Brookline Mason
 
04:58:16.250 --> 04:58:16.260 align:start position:0%
and Greenville in Hillsborough County
 
04:58:18.708 --> 04:58:18.718 align:start position:0%
District 36.
 
04:58:18.718 --> 04:58:20.090 align:start position:0%
District 36.
so

04:58:20.090 --> 04:58:20.100 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:58:20.100 --> 04:58:21.110 align:start position:0%
so
um

04:58:21.110 --> 04:58:21.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:58:23.810 --> 04:58:23.820 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna modify what I'm going to say
 
04:58:25.730 --> 04:58:25.740 align:start position:0%
because it's not a bill introduction so
 
04:58:29.090 --> 04:58:29.100 align:start position:0%
I would like to speak now on why this
 
04:58:31.910 --> 04:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
bill is needed to to reiterate perhaps
 
04:58:35.510 --> 04:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
what prior Witnesses testified
 
04:58:38.208 --> 04:58:38.218 align:start position:0%
this bill addresses overburdensome
 
04:58:40.368 --> 04:58:40.378 align:start position:0%
licensing requirements for individuals
 
04:58:42.288 --> 04:58:42.298 align:start position:0%
who wish to provide any of the three
 
04:58:44.628 --> 04:58:44.638 align:start position:0%
Niche Beauty services to clients here in
 
04:58:46.910 --> 04:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and those Niche Beauty
 
04:58:49.670 --> 04:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
services are shampoo and blow dry
 
04:58:52.190 --> 04:58:52.200 align:start position:0%
styling threading and makeup application
 
04:58:55.190 --> 04:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
under current state statute individuals
 
04:58:57.770 --> 04:58:57.780 align:start position:0%
who desire to provide these limited
 
04:59:00.470 --> 04:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
Beauty services to clients they must
 
04:59:03.350 --> 04:59:03.360 align:start position:0%
have a full cosmetology barbering and
 
04:59:06.128 --> 04:59:06.138 align:start position:0%
Aesthetics license issued by the state
 
04:59:09.410 --> 04:59:09.420 align:start position:0%
this creates unnecessary barriers to
 
04:59:11.410 --> 04:59:11.420 align:start position:0%
employment and it inhibits
 
04:59:15.110 --> 04:59:15.120 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurship for a number of reasons
 
04:59:17.448 --> 04:59:17.458 align:start position:0%
Niche beauty salons are unlike
 
04:59:20.270 --> 04:59:20.280 align:start position:0%
traditional full-service salons because
 
04:59:21.770 --> 04:59:21.780 align:start position:0%
they offer
 
04:59:24.948 --> 04:59:24.958 align:start position:0%
services that are their limited Services
 
04:59:27.410 --> 04:59:27.420 align:start position:0%
they're very specific and these services
 
04:59:30.970 --> 04:59:30.980 align:start position:0%
are inherently safe they do not use
 
04:59:34.090 --> 04:59:34.100 align:start position:0%
involve the use of potentially dangerous
 
04:59:36.650 --> 04:59:36.660 align:start position:0%
chemicals or tools
 
04:59:39.770 --> 04:59:39.780 align:start position:0%
for example Threading salons offer
 
04:59:42.670 --> 04:59:42.680 align:start position:0%
unwanted hair removal
 
04:59:46.970 --> 04:59:46.980 align:start position:0%
using cotton thread and threading is
 
04:59:49.970 --> 04:59:49.980 align:start position:0%
among the safest and most natural forms
 
04:59:52.368 --> 04:59:52.378 align:start position:0%
of hair removal threading does not
 
04:59:54.590 --> 04:59:54.600 align:start position:0%
involve the use of artificial chemicals
 
04:59:57.190 --> 04:59:57.200 align:start position:0%
waxes or shop tools
 
05:00:00.530 --> 05:00:00.540 align:start position:0%
also unlike traditional full service
 
05:00:05.330 --> 05:00:05.340 align:start position:0%
salons dry dry blow dry bars offer safe
 
05:00:08.690 --> 05:00:08.700 align:start position:0%
limited services including shampooing
 
05:00:11.570 --> 05:00:11.580 align:start position:0%
conditioning blow drying and styling of
 
05:00:15.170 --> 05:00:15.180 align:start position:0%
hair these specialty salons do not cut
 
05:00:18.410 --> 05:00:18.420 align:start position:0%
hair they do not use chemicals and they
 
05:00:20.330 --> 05:00:20.340 align:start position:0%
do not use dyes
 
05:00:23.270 --> 05:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
blow dry bars are no different than Hair
 
05:00:27.170 --> 05:00:27.180 align:start position:0%
Braiding salons in 2017 House Bill 82
 
05:00:29.810 --> 05:00:29.820 align:start position:0%
exempting Hair Braiding from regulation
 
05:00:32.390 --> 05:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
by the Board of barbering cosmetology
 
05:00:35.390 --> 05:00:35.400 align:start position:0%
and a sex was signed into law in New
 
05:00:35.400 --> 05:00:36.230 align:start position:0%
and a sex was signed into law in New
Hampshire

05:00:36.230 --> 05:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:00:38.990 --> 05:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
this bill before you seeks to do the
 
05:00:40.850 --> 05:00:40.860 align:start position:0%
same for these three Niche Beauty
 
05:00:40.860 --> 05:00:42.170 align:start position:0%
same for these three Niche Beauty
services

05:00:42.170 --> 05:00:42.180 align:start position:0%
services
 
05:00:46.970 --> 05:00:46.980 align:start position:0%
notably 2022 House Bill 1167 which I was
 
05:00:49.730 --> 05:00:49.740 align:start position:0%
the Prime sponsor of last year it was a
 
05:00:51.890 --> 05:00:51.900 align:start position:0%
niche Beauty bill
 
05:00:51.900 --> 05:00:52.490 align:start position:0%
niche Beauty bill
um

05:00:52.490 --> 05:00:52.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:56.510 --> 05:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
that bill as a result of it going
 
05:00:59.030 --> 05:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
through that the process here it passed
 
05:01:00.410 --> 05:01:00.420 align:start position:0%
the house and it went to the Senate
 
05:01:03.770 --> 05:01:03.780 align:start position:0%
there was feedback because it included a
 
05:01:05.690 --> 05:01:05.700 align:start position:0%
fourth Niche Beauty service and that was
 
05:01:09.708 --> 05:01:09.718 align:start position:0%
eyelash extensions during hearings and
 
05:01:11.390 --> 05:01:11.400 align:start position:0%
testimony there was a lot of concern
 
05:01:13.190 --> 05:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
with that particular Niche Beauty
 
05:01:16.310 --> 05:01:16.320 align:start position:0%
service and I listened to that feed book
 
05:01:19.010 --> 05:01:19.020 align:start position:0%
back and this year when I refiled the
 
05:01:22.430 --> 05:01:22.440 align:start position:0%
bill I removed eyelash extensions
 
05:01:22.440 --> 05:01:23.090 align:start position:0%
bill I removed eyelash extensions
um

05:01:23.090 --> 05:01:23.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:01:26.030 --> 05:01:26.040 align:start position:0%
from the bill moreover Niche beauty
 
05:01:28.788 --> 05:01:28.798 align:start position:0%
salons are unlike traditional full
 
05:01:31.010 --> 05:01:31.020 align:start position:0%
service salons because they offer
 
05:01:33.590 --> 05:01:33.600 align:start position:0%
services that people perform every day
 
05:01:35.150 --> 05:01:35.160 align:start position:0%
in their own homes
 
05:01:38.510 --> 05:01:38.520 align:start position:0%
for these tasks the supplies the tools
 
05:01:42.288 --> 05:01:42.298 align:start position:0%
shampoo blow dryers brushes Combs makeup
 
05:01:45.230 --> 05:01:45.240 align:start position:0%
and cotton thread they that they're
 
05:01:47.330 --> 05:01:47.340 align:start position:0%
readily available and they're purchased
 
05:01:49.850 --> 05:01:49.860 align:start position:0%
and they are used by children and adults
 
05:01:53.030 --> 05:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
every day what's more these Niche Beauty
 
05:01:55.490 --> 05:01:55.500 align:start position:0%
Services involve skills that are
 
05:01:59.030 --> 05:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
primarily learned at home outside of
 
05:02:00.948 --> 05:02:00.958 align:start position:0%
cosmetology schools
 
05:02:03.890 --> 05:02:03.900 align:start position:0%
currently in order to become a licensed
 
05:02:05.628 --> 05:02:05.638 align:start position:0%
Beauty provider in the state of New
 
05:02:08.410 --> 05:02:08.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire a person must first invest
 
05:02:11.448 --> 05:02:11.458 align:start position:0%
substantial time and money and they
 
05:02:14.090 --> 05:02:14.100 align:start position:0%
oftentimes incur significant financial
 
05:02:17.390 --> 05:02:17.400 align:start position:0%
debt in order to attend a cosmetology
 
05:02:20.208 --> 05:02:20.218 align:start position:0%
program and then pass the State
 
05:02:23.150 --> 05:02:23.160 align:start position:0%
Licensing exams in New Hampshire the
 
05:02:25.610 --> 05:02:25.620 align:start position:0%
average cosmetology program cost over
 
05:02:28.368 --> 05:02:28.378 align:start position:0%
nineteen thousand dollars and on top of
 
05:02:30.770 --> 05:02:30.780 align:start position:0%
that a person must pay about two hundred
 
05:02:34.310 --> 05:02:34.320 align:start position:0%
dollars in exam fees undoubtedly this
 
05:02:37.070 --> 05:02:37.080 align:start position:0%
process is time consuming costly and
 
05:02:37.080 --> 05:02:39.230 align:start position:0%
process is time consuming costly and
unjustifiable

05:02:39.230 --> 05:02:39.240 align:start position:0%
unjustifiable
 
05:02:41.990 --> 05:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
also these occupational licensing
 
05:02:45.010 --> 05:02:45.020 align:start position:0%
requirements disproportionately affect
 
05:02:47.628 --> 05:02:47.638 align:start position:0%
economically disadvantaged individuals
 
05:02:49.610 --> 05:02:49.620 align:start position:0%
the majority of which are women
 
05:02:52.310 --> 05:02:52.320 align:start position:0%
existing laws prescribing these require
 
05:02:55.128 --> 05:02:55.138 align:start position:0%
these requirements are an unnecessary
 
05:02:57.770 --> 05:02:57.780 align:start position:0%
barrier to employment and it makes it
 
05:02:59.690 --> 05:02:59.700 align:start position:0%
difficult for people who want to provide
 
05:03:02.570 --> 05:03:02.580 align:start position:0%
Niche Beauty services to be able to earn
 
05:03:04.190 --> 05:03:04.200 align:start position:0%
a living for themselves and their
 
05:03:07.990 --> 05:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
families and as we heard in prior
 
05:03:11.570 --> 05:03:11.580 align:start position:0%
testimony that sometimes and oftentimes
 
05:03:13.610 --> 05:03:13.620 align:start position:0%
these individuals are forced to work
 
05:03:16.368 --> 05:03:16.378 align:start position:0%
underground in addition these
 
05:03:18.890 --> 05:03:18.900 align:start position:0%
unnecessary requirements they harm
 
05:03:22.128 --> 05:03:22.138 align:start position:0%
consumers and they hurt our economy by

providers

05:03:26.570 --> 05:03:26.580 align:start position:0%
providers
 
05:03:28.730 --> 05:03:28.740 align:start position:0%
so um
 
05:03:32.150 --> 05:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
lastly how does this bill address the
 
05:03:34.430 --> 05:03:34.440 align:start position:0%
issue at hand the solution that the bill
 
05:03:37.070 --> 05:03:37.080 align:start position:0%
provides is straightforward first the
 
05:03:39.350 --> 05:03:39.360 align:start position:0%
bill defines the limited scope of
 
05:03:41.390 --> 05:03:41.400 align:start position:0%
practice for the for the following three
 
05:03:44.208 --> 05:03:44.218 align:start position:0%

05:03:46.310 --> 05:03:46.320 align:start position:0%
blow dry styling threading and makeup
 
05:03:49.368 --> 05:03:49.378 align:start position:0%
application and the bill exempts these
 
05:03:51.050 --> 05:03:51.060 align:start position:0%
three Niche Beauty services from
 
05:03:53.170 --> 05:03:53.180 align:start position:0%
Individual and facility license
 
05:03:57.948 --> 05:03:57.958 align:start position:0%
requirements similar to the 27 2017 Hair
 
05:04:00.230 --> 05:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
Braiding Bill and second this bill
 
05:04:02.868 --> 05:04:02.878 align:start position:0%
repeals the requirement for individual
 
05:04:05.448 --> 05:04:05.458 align:start position:0%
Booth licensure for independently
 
05:04:08.990 --> 05:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
operated booths attached to or within a
 
05:04:11.570 --> 05:04:11.580 align:start position:0%
licensed Salon or Barbershop this
 
05:04:14.030 --> 05:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
provision has been included at the
 
05:04:17.510 --> 05:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
request of the New Hampshire oplc
 
05:04:19.448 --> 05:04:19.458 align:start position:0%
in conclusion
 
05:04:21.708 --> 05:04:21.718 align:start position:0%
consumer demand for Niche Beauty
 
05:04:24.350 --> 05:04:24.360 align:start position:0%
Services is quickly growing across the
 
05:04:24.360 --> 05:04:25.448 align:start position:0%

country

05:04:25.448 --> 05:04:25.458 align:start position:0%
country
 
05:04:27.890 --> 05:04:27.900 align:start position:0%
overburdensome licensing requirements
 
05:04:29.690 --> 05:04:29.700 align:start position:0%
hurts workers
 
05:04:32.510 --> 05:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
customers and our economy
 
05:04:35.150 --> 05:04:35.160 align:start position:0%
similar to The Hair Braiding bill in
 
05:04:39.170 --> 05:04:39.180 align:start position:0%
2017 that is now a law this bill removes
 
05:04:41.690 --> 05:04:41.700 align:start position:0%
the unnecessary red tape for individuals
 
05:04:43.670 --> 05:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
seeking to work in the niche beauty
 
05:04:46.850 --> 05:04:46.860 align:start position:0%
industry this bet Bill benefits workers
 
05:04:49.610 --> 05:04:49.620 align:start position:0%
employers and consumers in the granite
 
05:04:52.670 --> 05:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
state by creating greater access to
 
05:04:55.128 --> 05:04:55.138 align:start position:0%
skilled labor and Beauty Services which
 
05:04:58.430 --> 05:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
in turn boosts our economy and lastly
 
05:05:01.970 --> 05:05:01.980 align:start position:0%
this bill upholds the current laws for
 
05:05:04.670 --> 05:05:04.680 align:start position:0%
the practice of licensed barbering
 
05:05:08.350 --> 05:05:08.360 align:start position:0%

offering the full scope of beauty
 
05:05:14.270 --> 05:05:14.280 align:start position:0%
services that concludes my testimony
 
05:05:16.430 --> 05:05:16.440 align:start position:0%

representative

05:05:23.510 --> 05:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:05:25.550 --> 05:05:25.560 align:start position:0%
she tied me but you looked in my
 
05:05:28.610 --> 05:05:28.620 align:start position:0%
direction first you you drew the Short
 
05:05:30.590 --> 05:05:30.600 align:start position:0%
Straw representative Schmidt asked your
 
05:05:35.208 --> 05:05:35.218 align:start position:0%
question okay so uh thank you uh so
 
05:05:36.948 --> 05:05:36.958 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
05:05:38.990 --> 05:05:39.000 align:start position:0%

representative and
um

05:05:40.330 --> 05:05:40.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:05:42.970 --> 05:05:42.980 align:start position:0%
although I I heard way too many
 
05:05:45.948 --> 05:05:45.958 align:start position:0%
burdensoms here I found your burdensome
 
05:05:50.030 --> 05:05:50.040 align:start position:0%
reference and it burdensome so uh but
 
05:05:53.810 --> 05:05:53.820 align:start position:0%
um how many of these Niche salons are
 
05:05:55.850 --> 05:05:55.860 align:start position:0%
there currently in New Hampshire
 
05:06:00.050 --> 05:06:00.060 align:start position:0%
roughly I don't expect an exact count
 
05:06:02.930 --> 05:06:02.940 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that there are two
 
05:06:06.230 --> 05:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
um well there's two blow dry bars that
 
05:06:09.770 --> 05:06:09.780 align:start position:0%
I'm aware of and then Ulta beauty shop
 
05:06:09.780 --> 05:06:11.510 align:start position:0%
I'm aware of and then Ulta beauty shop
has

05:06:11.510 --> 05:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
has
 
05:06:14.510 --> 05:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
um a similar type Salon within their
 
05:06:14.520 --> 05:06:16.368 align:start position:0%
um a similar type Salon within their
store

05:06:16.368 --> 05:06:16.378 align:start position:0%
store
 
05:06:19.610 --> 05:06:19.620 align:start position:0%
however one must have a full cosmetology
 
05:06:19.620 --> 05:06:21.830 align:start position:0%
however one must have a full cosmetology
license

05:06:21.830 --> 05:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
license
 
05:06:25.368 --> 05:06:25.378 align:start position:0%
I thought we Exempted some of this stuff
 
05:06:27.490 --> 05:06:27.500 align:start position:0%
last year
 
05:06:31.070 --> 05:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
the only thing we Exempted lot wasn't
 
05:06:33.948 --> 05:06:33.958 align:start position:0%
last year was braiding the bill that we
 
05:06:36.650 --> 05:06:36.660 align:start position:0%
passed last year died in the Senate and
 
05:06:38.570 --> 05:06:38.580 align:start position:0%
did not that has been reference thank
 
05:06:42.230 --> 05:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
you that that's good so there's only two
 
05:06:45.170 --> 05:06:45.180 align:start position:0%
of these salons what is your estimate in
 
05:06:47.150 --> 05:06:47.160 align:start position:0%
terms of how many there would be if we
 
05:06:49.610 --> 05:06:49.620 align:start position:0%
passed this bill I thank you for the
 
05:06:52.310 --> 05:06:52.320 align:start position:0%
question representative I did not do
 
05:06:55.550 --> 05:06:55.560 align:start position:0%
data research to to to you know across
 
05:06:58.368 --> 05:06:58.378 align:start position:0%
the state and call information as to how
 
05:07:02.330 --> 05:07:02.340 align:start position:0%
many um of these salons as you asked
 
05:07:05.150 --> 05:07:05.160 align:start position:0%
that my answer was based on what I just
 
05:07:07.690 --> 05:07:07.700 align:start position:0%
know in in passing
 
05:07:11.208 --> 05:07:11.218 align:start position:0%
and you're asking how
 
05:07:14.208 --> 05:07:14.218 align:start position:0%
how many more businesses would open up
 
05:07:18.050 --> 05:07:18.060 align:start position:0%
that is indeterminable we've heard so
 
05:07:20.770 --> 05:07:20.780 align:start position:0%
much testimony that this seems like it's
 
05:07:23.390 --> 05:07:23.400 align:start position:0%
everywhere Schmidt she's just said she
 
05:07:25.670 --> 05:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't know well I I understand but but
 
05:07:28.430 --> 05:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
the thing is there was only two somehow
 
05:07:31.610 --> 05:07:31.620 align:start position:0%
they got right now they are required by
 
05:07:33.910 --> 05:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
our laws to only employ licensed
 
05:07:36.830 --> 05:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
cosmetologists if they were able to
 
05:07:40.430 --> 05:07:40.440 align:start position:0%
employ without licenses would be cheaper
 
05:07:42.770 --> 05:07:42.780 align:start position:0%
there might well I get that but the
 
05:07:45.708 --> 05:07:45.718 align:start position:0%
thing is that we only have two and and
 
05:07:48.288 --> 05:07:48.298 align:start position:0%
but there is a considerable amount of
 
05:07:51.110 --> 05:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
testimony that suggests to me that this
 
05:07:54.350 --> 05:07:54.360 align:start position:0%
is incredibly in demand and I'm just I'm
 
05:07:56.750 --> 05:07:56.760 align:start position:0%
wondering so I'll I'll take another line
 
05:07:59.930 --> 05:07:59.940 align:start position:0%
of questions may I respond
 
05:08:03.288 --> 05:08:03.298 align:start position:0%
if you wish to okay so representative as
 
05:08:05.510 --> 05:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
I recall the there was a prior witness
 
05:08:07.690 --> 05:08:07.700 align:start position:0%
that that did speak to that specifically
 
05:08:11.930 --> 05:08:11.940 align:start position:0%
that she is a researcher and
 
05:08:14.090 --> 05:08:14.100 align:start position:0%
um with the institute for justice and
 
05:08:16.970 --> 05:08:16.980 align:start position:0%
she did um I recall specify
 
05:08:19.670 --> 05:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
that when other states in our country
 
05:08:19.680 --> 05:08:21.610 align:start position:0%
that when other states in our country
Exempted

05:08:21.610 --> 05:08:21.620 align:start position:0%
Exempted
 
05:08:25.730 --> 05:08:25.740 align:start position:0%
this Pro this licensure requirement that
 
05:08:28.010 --> 05:08:28.020 align:start position:0%
there were a number of workers that
 
05:08:31.970 --> 05:08:31.980 align:start position:0%
entered that field and additionally I I
 
05:08:34.430 --> 05:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
don't recall that the number right I can
 
05:08:37.368 --> 05:08:37.378 align:start position:0%
get it for you and there were businesses
 
05:08:40.368 --> 05:08:40.378 align:start position:0%
that that did open in other states that
 
05:08:42.890 --> 05:08:42.900 align:start position:0%
that did exactly what this bill is
 
05:08:45.288 --> 05:08:45.298 align:start position:0%
looking to do okay I hear your testimony
 
05:08:48.288 --> 05:08:48.298 align:start position:0%
so I can follow up because one of the
 
05:08:51.410 --> 05:08:51.420 align:start position:0%
reasons that that I'm
 
05:08:54.948 --> 05:08:54.958 align:start position:0%
taking this line of inquiry is that I'm
 
05:08:57.288 --> 05:08:57.298 align:start position:0%
very concerned about the aspect of
 
05:08:59.330 --> 05:08:59.340 align:start position:0%
hygiene I referenced it in my earlier
 
05:09:01.610 --> 05:09:01.620 align:start position:0%
question to another witness and the
 
05:09:04.788 --> 05:09:04.798 align:start position:0%
thing is that when you are doing this
 
05:09:07.550 --> 05:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
threading thing you are in very close
 
05:09:10.910 --> 05:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
proximity to people's eyes and to the
 
05:09:15.230 --> 05:09:15.240 align:start position:0%
degree you have a an basically an
 
05:09:17.510 --> 05:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
individual with relatively little
 
05:09:20.090 --> 05:09:20.100 align:start position:0%
training this is we're given to
 
05:09:22.190 --> 05:09:22.200 align:start position:0%
understand that these are the kinds of
 
05:09:24.288 --> 05:09:24.298 align:start position:0%
things that people learn at home they do
 
05:09:27.310 --> 05:09:27.320 align:start position:0%
it with their brothers and sisters
 
05:09:30.288 --> 05:09:30.298 align:start position:0%
Mike I am asking my question
 
05:09:33.110 --> 05:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
if if you if we're going to have a large
 
05:09:37.430 --> 05:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
number of these institutions of you know
 
05:09:40.310 --> 05:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
blowing up everywhere blow drying and so
 
05:09:43.550 --> 05:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
forth but threading seems to I notice if
 
05:09:45.230 --> 05:09:45.240 align:start position:0%
you look at watch television and you pay
 
05:09:47.330 --> 05:09:47.340 align:start position:0%
any attention you see that women's
 
05:09:50.690 --> 05:09:50.700 align:start position:0%
eyebrows are a major
 
05:09:55.550 --> 05:09:55.560 align:start position:0%
a major aspect of women's facial makeup
 
05:09:58.610 --> 05:09:58.620 align:start position:0%
just just look at eyebrows ladies and
 
05:10:00.530 --> 05:10:00.540 align:start position:0%
gentlemen look at eyebrows on television
 
05:10:03.288 --> 05:10:03.298 align:start position:0%
please represent okay so the point is if
 
05:10:05.090 --> 05:10:05.100 align:start position:0%
the if we're going to see lots and lots
 
05:10:07.788 --> 05:10:07.798 align:start position:0%
of these things with people with minimal
 
05:10:10.610 --> 05:10:10.620 align:start position:0%
training working in close proximity to
 
05:10:14.390 --> 05:10:14.400 align:start position:0%
people's eyes I want to go on record as
 
05:10:16.310 --> 05:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
saying that I have a great concern with
 
05:10:19.208 --> 05:10:19.218 align:start position:0%
regard to the potential
 
05:10:23.288 --> 05:10:23.298 align:start position:0%
endangerment of our female population
 
05:10:25.330 --> 05:10:25.340 align:start position:0%
who will be
 
05:10:28.970 --> 05:10:28.980 align:start position:0%
I I want to know whether you have a
 
05:10:28.980 --> 05:10:29.930 align:start position:0%
I I want to know whether you have a
concern

05:10:29.930 --> 05:10:29.940 align:start position:0%
concern
 
05:10:34.750 --> 05:10:34.760 align:start position:0%
about the possibility of eye infections
 
05:10:37.730 --> 05:10:37.740 align:start position:0%
as a result of working with people's
 
05:10:37.740 --> 05:10:40.850 align:start position:0%
as a result of working with people's
eyes

05:10:40.850 --> 05:10:40.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:42.530 --> 05:10:42.540 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for bringing up
 
05:10:44.150 --> 05:10:44.160 align:start position:0%
that point that is an important point
 
05:10:47.030 --> 05:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
and on page two of the bill in Section 5
 
05:10:51.650 --> 05:10:51.660 align:start position:0%
line 16 through 22 that is addressed
 
05:10:55.730 --> 05:10:55.740 align:start position:0%
it says that the owner of a salon
 
05:10:58.128 --> 05:10:58.138 align:start position:0%
shall verify the education training
 
05:11:00.110 --> 05:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
skills and the competence of the person

05:11:30.948 --> 05:11:30.958 align:start position:0%
representative a bear
 
05:11:35.208 --> 05:11:35.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:37.010 --> 05:11:37.020 align:start position:0%
thank you representative power for
 
05:11:42.288 --> 05:11:42.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:45.288 --> 05:11:45.298 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
05:11:47.570 --> 05:11:47.580 align:start position:0%
on page
 
05:11:47.580 --> 05:11:50.690 align:start position:0%
on page
four

05:11:50.690 --> 05:11:50.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:53.750 --> 05:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
three oh page two sorry I was counting
 
05:11:55.550 --> 05:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
the front of the bill
 
05:11:58.250 --> 05:11:58.260 align:start position:0%
um page two where it says hire employee
 
05:12:01.490 --> 05:12:01.500 align:start position:0%
at line one Higher employee or rent a
 
05:12:04.250 --> 05:12:04.260 align:start position:0%
booth so this person would not be an
 
05:12:08.150 --> 05:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
employee they would be a subcontractor
 
05:12:10.730 --> 05:12:10.740 align:start position:0%
of the
 
05:12:10.740 --> 05:12:11.628 align:start position:0%
of the
um

05:12:11.628 --> 05:12:11.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:12:15.288 --> 05:12:15.298 align:start position:0%
and paragraph five on line 16 that the
 
05:12:17.090 --> 05:12:17.100 align:start position:0%
owner of the salon so I see a little bit
 
05:12:18.770 --> 05:12:18.780 align:start position:0%
of a challenge here but let me tell you
 
05:12:20.868 --> 05:12:20.878 align:start position:0%
where I'm going with this
 
05:12:23.690 --> 05:12:23.700 align:start position:0%
um the chemicals that are used in the
 
05:12:27.590 --> 05:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
makeup shampooing or prep would that be
 
05:12:31.788 --> 05:12:31.798 align:start position:0%
overseen by the owner of the salon and I
 
05:12:34.610 --> 05:12:34.620 align:start position:0%
think that needs to be addressed
 
05:12:38.390 --> 05:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
could you repeat the the question
 
05:12:43.490 --> 05:12:43.500 align:start position:0%
I said I if I make she's asking if the
 
05:12:46.250 --> 05:12:46.260 align:start position:0%
chemicals if any that are used for
 
05:12:46.260 --> 05:12:47.770 align:start position:0%
chemicals if any that are used for
shampooing

05:12:47.770 --> 05:12:47.780 align:start position:0%
shampooing
 
05:12:51.530 --> 05:12:51.540 align:start position:0%
our rig are under the authority of the
 
05:12:56.570 --> 05:12:56.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:59.628 --> 05:12:59.638 align:start position:0%
I would so
 
05:12:59.638 --> 05:13:01.430 align:start position:0%
I would so
shampoo

05:13:01.430 --> 05:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
shampoo
 
05:13:05.208 --> 05:13:05.218 align:start position:0%
I guess technically it's it's a chemical
 
05:13:07.430 --> 05:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
but I don't see it as a dangerous
 
05:13:10.850 --> 05:13:10.860 align:start position:0%
chemical yep could I clarify so
 
05:13:14.090 --> 05:13:14.100 align:start position:0%
um my my point is makeup
 
05:13:14.100 --> 05:13:14.990 align:start position:0%
um my my point is makeup
um

05:13:14.990 --> 05:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:13:15.000 --> 05:13:20.930 align:start position:0%
um
so

05:13:20.930 --> 05:13:20.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:23.208 --> 05:13:23.218 align:start position:0%
I think we can let the subcommittee
 
05:13:24.830 --> 05:13:24.840 align:start position:0%
worry about that you're on the
 
05:13:24.840 --> 05:13:27.590 align:start position:0%
worry about that you're on the
subcommittee

05:13:27.590 --> 05:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:30.288 --> 05:13:30.298 align:start position:0%
