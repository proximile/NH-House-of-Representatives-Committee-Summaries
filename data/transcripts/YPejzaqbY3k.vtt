and um I've been requested by the

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
don't forget to turn the mic on y got
 
00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:46.240 align:start position:0%
that that was so my name is dearer
 
00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
Grimes um I worked in the private sector
 
00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
for 15 years as an HR Director uh joined
 
00:10:54.069 --> 00:10:54.079 align:start position:0%
fishing game in July of
 
00:10:56.069 --> 00:10:56.079 align:start position:0%
2022 and let me tell you state is
 
00:10:58.550 --> 00:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
definitely different than private sector
 
00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
um but as ask any employee what an HR
 
00:11:02.269 --> 00:11:02.279 align:start position:0%
department is and you'll get an answer
 
00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
that Prim primarily deals with the most
 
00:11:07.629 --> 00:11:07.639 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable aspects of work HR
 
00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:10.160 align:start position:0%
violations layoffs and firing but the
 
00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
truth is human resources is there to
 
00:11:15.389 --> 00:11:15.399 align:start position:0%
support employees it's quite literally
 
00:11:18.629 --> 00:11:18.639 align:start position:0%
literally a resource for humans um in
 
00:11:21.509 --> 00:11:21.519 align:start position:0%
our department we do payroll recruit
 
00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:24.800 align:start position:0%

00:11:27.949 --> 00:11:27.959 align:start position:0%

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:30.720 align:start position:0%
disciplinary actions maintain employee

00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:35.320 align:start position:0%
human resource department heavily
 
00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:38.120 align:start position:0%
contributes to the company's
 
00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
culture if HR generally cares about the
 
00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:43.240 align:start position:0%
well-being of employees the culture will
 
00:11:46.389 --> 00:11:46.399 align:start position:0%
be one of the openness and growth I care
 
00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:48.800 align:start position:0%

when items in the fleet are going to be
 
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:36.640 align:start position:0%
retired or not used what's the process
 
00:20:39.789 --> 00:20:39.799 align:start position:0%
to get rid of them that is called
 
00:20:43.149 --> 00:20:43.159 align:start position:0%
Surplus and once it is deemed that that
 
00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:46.280 align:start position:0%
piece of equipment is no longer usable
 
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
we have to go through a process of
 
00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
surplus so the originating division who
 
00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:53.039 align:start position:0%
own who is responsible for that piece of
 
00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
equipment would fill out the proper
 
00:20:57.710 --> 00:20:57.720 align:start position:0%
paperwork and it would go through a
 
00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
system of being put into the state's
 
00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
official Financial system for the state
 
00:21:07.789 --> 00:21:07.799 align:start position:0%

can work a trail system then he can drop
 
00:21:39.669 --> 00:21:39.679 align:start position:0%
down onto the highway to go to a pond to
 
00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:41.720 align:start position:0%
check fisherman so work so and we give

that we receive through through our
 
00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:48.120 align:start position:0%
grant programs uh with the exception of
 
00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
some extraordinary situation like uh
 
00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:53.240 align:start position:0%
emergency relief funds or the op funding
 
00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
that came uh through co uh in most
 
00:24:58.350 --> 00:24:58.360 align:start position:0%
typical years uh the department received
 
00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:00.600 align:start position:0%
receives nearly all of its Federal uh
 
00:25:03.870 --> 00:25:03.880 align:start position:0%
Revenue through two uh from two federal
 
00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:05.320 align:start position:0%
agencies from the fish and wildlife
 
00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
service and then from uh Noah the
 
00:25:11.149 --> 00:25:11.159 align:start position:0%
National Oceanic and Atmospheric
 
00:25:13.909 --> 00:25:13.919 align:start position:0%
Administration and in most years about
 
00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:16.720 align:start position:0%
75% of all of that federal revenue comes
 
00:25:18.549 --> 00:25:18.559 align:start position:0%
from just two programs the wildlife
 
00:25:20.789 --> 00:25:20.799 align:start position:0%
restoration program and the sportfish
 
00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
restoration program that's the Pitman
 
00:25:24.789 --> 00:25:24.799 align:start position:0%
Robertson Robertson act that you may
 
00:25:26.549 --> 00:25:26.559 align:start position:0%
have heard of and the Dingle Johnson act
 
00:25:30.909 --> 00:25:30.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:33.720 align:start position:0%
side those Pro those programs provide a
 
00:25:37.029 --> 00:25:37.039 align:start position:0%
formula based funding uh Arrangement uh
 
00:25:39.029 --> 00:25:39.039 align:start position:0%
it's based on the federal statutes and
 
00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:40.600 align:start position:0%
there's an annual apportionment that's
 
00:25:42.909 --> 00:25:42.919 align:start position:0%
based on the applicable uh tax revenues
 
00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:44.720 align:start position:0%
that come into each of the
 
00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:47.320 align:start position:0%
programs uh our other federal aid into
 
00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:50.480 align:start position:0%
the department is based on um
 
00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:52.440 align:start position:0%
Congressional Appropriations it dep just
 
00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
depends on how much they fund the
 
00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
particular Grant programs uh some of
 
00:25:57.630 --> 00:25:57.640 align:start position:0%
those sources of funding are state
 
00:25:59.750 --> 00:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
wildlife Grant GRS uh we have Noah
 
00:26:01.269 --> 00:26:01.279 align:start position:0%
Fisheries grants for the Marine
 
00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:04.840 align:start position:0%
division's work uh and some funding from
 
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
U the national Noah's National estu and
 
00:26:08.909 --> 00:26:08.919 align:start position:0%
research Reserve
 
00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:11.320 align:start position:0%
System uh but Federal a is a key part of
 
00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
the fund uh the Department's operations
 
00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
and it it does require a significant
 
00:26:17.789 --> 00:26:17.799 align:start position:0%
administrative effort on the part of the
 
00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:19.960 align:start position:0%
department uh myself and an assistant
 
00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:22.600 align:start position:0%
end up working with uh all the division
 
00:26:24.149 --> 00:26:24.159 align:start position:0%
Chiefs and project leaders in their
 
00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
division as well as extensively with
 
00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
Cathy's division because handles
 
00:26:30.549 --> 00:26:30.559 align:start position:0%
probably the most important part of the
 
00:26:32.149 --> 00:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
grants which is the whole reason for
 
00:26:33.669 --> 00:26:33.679 align:start position:0%
them and that's the the federal
 
00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:35.960 align:start position:0%
reimbursements that we get for our for
 
00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:38.430 align:start position:0%
reimbursements that we get for our for
our

00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:38.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:40.720 align:start position:0%

00:29:01.389 --> 00:29:01.399 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman members of the
 
00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
committee um Dan buron I'm the chief of
 
00:29:05.789 --> 00:29:05.799 align:start position:0%
the wildlife division I've been with the
 
00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:08.120 align:start position:0%
department for about 12 years now I
 
00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:10.200 align:start position:0%
started there as the deer biologist and
 
00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
then transitioned over to the game
 
00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:14.200 align:start position:0%
program supervisor um now I'm the chief
 
00:29:16.669 --> 00:29:16.679 align:start position:0%
of the wildlife division um So within
 
00:29:17.909 --> 00:29:17.919 align:start position:0%
the wildlife division we have
 
00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:20.440 align:start position:0%
approximately 30 to 35 Staff um
 
00:29:22.389 --> 00:29:22.399 align:start position:0%
depending on seasonals and if we're up
 
00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:25.960 align:start position:0%
to full staff um we have five kind of
 
00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:29.080 align:start position:0%
primary um um things we focus on so the
 
00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
first which most people are probably
 
00:29:32.029 --> 00:29:32.039 align:start position:0%
familiar with is our game Management
 
00:29:34.149 --> 00:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
program and we also have non-game and
 
00:29:36.669 --> 00:29:36.679 align:start position:0%
endangered species management uh land
 
00:29:38.909 --> 00:29:38.919 align:start position:0%
conservation and habitat management um
 
00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:41.440 align:start position:0%
we have a big data collection um entry
 
00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:44.240 align:start position:0%
and Analysis um um section and then also
 
00:29:46.269 --> 00:29:46.279 align:start position:0%
we do animal damage
 
00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:49.000 align:start position:0%
control um our division is primarily
 
00:29:52.269 --> 00:29:52.279 align:start position:0%
funded through dedicated licenses um
 
00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
permit Revenue um but but as Randy had
 
00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:56.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned the bulk of the money comes
 
00:29:58.509 --> 00:29:58.519 align:start position:0%
from federal grants uh we really would
 
00:29:59.909 --> 00:29:59.919 align:start position:0%
not be able to do the work that our
 
00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
division does without the the federal
 
00:30:04.669 --> 00:30:04.679 align:start position:0%
money um our budget um typically within
 
00:30:06.389 --> 00:30:06.399 align:start position:0%
the wildlife division is about $7
 
00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
million um which makes up about 177% of
 
00:30:12.430 --> 00:30:12.440 align:start position:0%
the overall um Fish and Game
 
00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
budget um so the different type of work
 
00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
we do um so we manage Monitor and
 
00:30:19.950 --> 00:30:19.960 align:start position:0%
conserve game species um including deer
 
00:30:23.029 --> 00:30:23.039 align:start position:0%
bear moose turkey small game species fur
 
00:30:26.029 --> 00:30:26.039 align:start position:0%
bear species and water fowl uh we cons
 
00:30:27.389 --> 00:30:27.399 align:start position:0%
serve and monitor non-game and
 
00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
endangered Wildlife um including things
 
00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:31.880 align:start position:0%
like blandings turtle wood Turtles bald
 
00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
eagles paragan Falcons New England
 
00:30:36.549 --> 00:30:36.559 align:start position:0%
cotton Tails carer blue butterflies and
 
00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
hundreds of other species um in in
 
00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:42.200 align:start position:0%
conservation need um we also have a a
 
00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:44.600 align:start position:0%
unit within the wildlife program that
 
00:30:46.350 --> 00:30:46.360 align:start position:0%
does do some environmental review that's
 
00:30:47.909 --> 00:30:47.919 align:start position:0%
specific to threaten an endangered
 
00:30:50.509 --> 00:30:50.519 align:start position:0%
species um and that's related to state
 
00:30:52.110 --> 00:30:52.120 align:start position:0%
funded activities and permitting
 
00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:53.720 align:start position:0%
projects through other state
 
00:30:56.190 --> 00:30:56.200 align:start position:0%
agencies um we also conserve and manage
 
00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
Wildlife um habitat on over 60,000 Acres
 
00:31:01.549 --> 00:31:01.559 align:start position:0%
of Fish and Game owned properties and
 
00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:03.720 align:start position:0%
over 20,000 Acres of of land that's
 
00:31:05.149 --> 00:31:05.159 align:start position:0%
under conservation
 
00:31:07.389 --> 00:31:07.399 align:start position:0%
easements um we provide technical
 
00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:09.480 align:start position:0%
assistance to different municipalities
 
00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:11.440 align:start position:0%
industrial Forest land owners private
 
00:31:12.909 --> 00:31:12.919 align:start position:0%
land owners that are interested in
 
00:31:15.549 --> 00:31:15.559 align:start position:0%
wildlife habitat management um and then
 
00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
we can serve high value wildlife
 
00:31:20.389 --> 00:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
habitats through fee purchases um indoor
 
00:31:22.549 --> 00:31:22.559 align:start position:0%
easements um and then we also provide
 
00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:25.880 align:start position:0%
animal damage control assistance um so
 
00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes that's through technical
 
00:31:28.509 --> 00:31:28.519 align:start position:0%
assistance or we do have have permit
 
00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:31.480 align:start position:0%
programs where agricultural Growers um
 
00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:33.440 align:start position:0%
um can remove Wildlife that are causing
 
00:31:35.909 --> 00:31:35.919 align:start position:0%
damage on their property um we have a
 
00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
reimbursement program for Bare damage um
 
00:31:41.149 --> 00:31:41.159 align:start position:0%
but we have one staff member um that
 
00:31:43.629 --> 00:31:43.639 align:start position:0%
oversees that whole program um but then
 
00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:45.480 align:start position:0%
also works cooperatively with the United
 
00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:47.200 align:start position:0%
States Department of Agriculture
 
00:31:49.389 --> 00:31:49.399 align:start position:0%
wildlife services here in
 
00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
coner um we do a lot of research
 
00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
um um the federal money that Randy had
 
00:31:58.310 --> 00:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned again we we we've been very
 
00:31:59.710 --> 00:31:59.720 align:start position:0%
good at leveraging that with different
 
00:32:02.029 --> 00:32:02.039 align:start position:0%
universities so we've conducted um
 
00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:04.840 align:start position:0%
numerous research projects for moose uh
 
00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:08.120 align:start position:0%
deer bear furbearers numerous non-game
 
00:32:10.789 --> 00:32:10.799 align:start position:0%
species um we have a current research
 
00:32:13.269 --> 00:32:13.279 align:start position:0%
project going on looking at um cause
 
00:32:14.909 --> 00:32:14.919 align:start position:0%
specific mortality in our Fisher
 
00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:16.600 align:start position:0%
population that we're working with the
 
00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:19.320 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire on um and a
 
00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
lot of these research projects because
 
00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
we're able to leverage the federal money
 
00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:25.320 align:start position:0%
and then UNH provides the match um the
 
00:32:27.669 --> 00:32:27.679 align:start position:0%
research is conducted at no cost to the
 
00:32:31.029 --> 00:32:31.039 align:start position:0%
to the state or the agency um so it very
 
00:32:32.990 --> 00:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
beneficial relationship and as as Kathy
 
00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:35.440 align:start position:0%
and Randy pointed out um you know the
 
00:32:36.789 --> 00:32:36.799 align:start position:0%
federal money we wouldn't be able to do
 
00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
our work but we wouldn't be able to do
 
00:32:41.509 --> 00:32:41.519 align:start position:0%
our work with with the with the um work
 
00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:44.760 align:start position:0%
that they do um and we need 10 times
 
00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
more ry's and Cathy in our agency um
 
00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:50.320 align:start position:0%
with that I'll take any
 
00:32:53.149 --> 00:32:53.159 align:start position:0%
questions representative Harvey when is
 
00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:56.320 align:start position:0%
the results for this Fisher um project
 
00:32:57.669 --> 00:32:57.679 align:start position:0%
when can we expect to see the results
 
00:33:00.389 --> 00:33:00.399 align:start position:0%
from from that so it just got underway
 
00:33:01.870 --> 00:33:01.880 align:start position:0%
um they're still in the process of
 
00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
trying to capture and put collars on on
 
00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
animals um so it'll be at least another
 
00:33:07.909 --> 00:33:07.919 align:start position:0%
two years before we start to see any
 
00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:11.440 align:start position:0%
Real Results um so um with most of the
 
00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:13.480 align:start position:0%
research most of our research is usually
 
00:33:16.549 --> 00:33:16.559 align:start position:0%
typically you know two to three years um
 
00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
um often times we'll expand those so
 
00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
Moose for example we've been kind of
 
00:33:23.669 --> 00:33:23.679 align:start position:0%
consistently doing research on moose um
 
00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:28.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:31.480 align:start position:0%
who puts the collar on the Fishers um so
 
00:33:34.029 --> 00:33:34.039 align:start position:0%
it's it's usually um it varies but it's
 
00:33:36.269 --> 00:33:36.279 align:start position:0%
typically it'll be the UNH uh graduate
 
00:33:39.029 --> 00:33:39.039 align:start position:0%
students and advisers and then staff um
 
00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:40.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes assist depending on the need
 
00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:33:46.389 --> 00:33:46.399 align:start position:0%
availability hope they have good medical
 
00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
insurance uh any further questions
 
00:33:51.509 --> 00:33:51.519 align:start position:0%
representative ulette thank you for
 
00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:53.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question you had mentioned
 
00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
that the fish game department has 60,000
 
00:33:59.789 --> 00:33:59.799 align:start position:0%
Acres of property and 20,000 acres in
 
00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
conservation is is a that part of the
 
00:34:06.269 --> 00:34:06.279 align:start position:0%
program to continually um purchase
 
00:34:08.470 --> 00:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
additional properties and is there a set
 
00:34:10.909 --> 00:34:10.919 align:start position:0%
goal in the long term what you want to
 
00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:13.919 align:start position:0%
own a set goal in terms of the amount of
 
00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
property we want to own um there's no
 
00:34:19.869 --> 00:34:19.879 align:start position:0%
set goal really um our like most of our
 
00:34:23.069 --> 00:34:23.079 align:start position:0%
programs um we're we're underst staffed
 
00:34:25.230 --> 00:34:25.240 align:start position:0%
um one of the things we've kind of
 
00:34:26.950 --> 00:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
shifted towards a little bit more in
 
00:34:28.950 --> 00:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
recent years is stewardship of those
 
00:34:31.829 --> 00:34:31.839 align:start position:0%
properties um um we've added a few
 
00:34:33.909 --> 00:34:33.919 align:start position:0%
additional staff um over the last few
 
00:34:37.389 --> 00:34:37.399 align:start position:0%
years a land surveyor um we we have a
 
00:34:38.909 --> 00:34:38.919 align:start position:0%
staff member that can go out and do some
 
00:34:40.869 --> 00:34:40.879 align:start position:0%
more kind of um you know small level
 
00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:42.800 align:start position:0%
road work and and maintenance things on
 
00:34:45.389 --> 00:34:45.399 align:start position:0%
our property so there's no specific goal
 
00:34:47.349 --> 00:34:47.359 align:start position:0%
um we kind of we kind of pick up
 
00:34:49.430 --> 00:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
properties you know we we look at we
 
00:34:51.349 --> 00:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
look at different pieces of lands in
 
00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:53.320 align:start position:0%
relation to other conservation land and
 
00:34:54.950 --> 00:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
the benefit to different species
 
00:34:56.349 --> 00:34:56.359 align:start position:0%
throughout the state so there's no
 
00:34:58.470 --> 00:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
target um the amount of land we're
 
00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
looking to own which really kind of um
 
00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:02.280 align:start position:0%
as properties come up we look at the
 
00:35:05.109 --> 00:35:05.119 align:start position:0%
value our ability to purchase it um we
 
00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
we often times work with other partners
 
00:35:11.109 --> 00:35:11.119 align:start position:0%
um different um um land conservation
 
00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
groups um so again we can leverage
 
00:35:16.829 --> 00:35:16.839 align:start position:0%
additional funds um but no no specific
 
00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:18.040 align:start position:0%
Target for the amount of land we're
 
00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:19.640 align:start position:0%
looking to
 
00:35:23.069 --> 00:35:23.079 align:start position:0%
own representative Harvey does that
 
00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:25.160 align:start position:0%
conservation land include um access to
 
00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:27.200 align:start position:0%
waterways or is that going to be covered
 
00:35:28.270 --> 00:35:28.280 align:start position:0%
by a different
 
00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
division um some of it will um but but
 
00:35:34.589 --> 00:35:34.599 align:start position:0%
not necessarily so there's boat access
 
00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:36.640 align:start position:0%
as well which is which is different and
 
00:35:39.550 --> 00:35:39.560 align:start position:0%
then um the Fisheries division has some
 
00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:42.280 align:start position:0%
um some habitat stuff they do as well
 
00:35:44.109 --> 00:35:44.119 align:start position:0%
and if we can coordinate with other
 
00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:45.960 align:start position:0%
divisions where where those interests
 
00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:47.640 align:start position:0%
might align we'll we'll consider that
 
00:35:50.109 --> 00:35:50.119 align:start position:0%
but um it's not a primary focus but some
 
00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
of the land just you know because of
 
00:35:53.829 --> 00:35:53.839 align:start position:0%
where it's located we'll have access to
 
00:35:56.550 --> 00:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
waterways but may I ask a followup
 
00:35:59.790 --> 00:35:59.800 align:start position:0%
please followup so can you tell me how
 
00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:01.960 align:start position:0%
much you may not be able to break it
 
00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:04.440 align:start position:0%
down that far but is is out of those
 
00:36:07.109 --> 00:36:07.119 align:start position:0%
880,000 Acres can you tell me how much
 
00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
is access to waterways either um boat
 
00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:11.829 align:start position:0%
is access to waterways either um boat
access

00:36:11.829 --> 00:36:11.839 align:start position:0%
access
 
00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
or swimming or whatever I could look
 
00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:16.200 align:start position:0%
into that for you I do not have that
 
00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:18.640 align:start position:0%
number kind of off the top of my head
 
00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
but I'd appreciate that thank you yeah
 
00:36:21.829 --> 00:36:21.839 align:start position:0%
it it would would you be interested
 
00:36:22.990 --> 00:36:23.000 align:start position:0%
would you be able to email me
 
00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
specifically what you're interested in
 
00:36:26.109 --> 00:36:26.119 align:start position:0%
and we can look into it that'd be great
 
00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:31.349 --> 00:36:31.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:36:33.790 --> 00:36:33.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh there was some
 
00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
discussion in my district uh last season
 
00:36:40.270 --> 00:36:40.280 align:start position:0%
about few years ago we heard that there
 
00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
was some uh disease coming towards this
 
00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
way deer bone you know like a bone
 
00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
marrow type uh disease through deer what
 
00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
is the situation now that um uh if you
 
00:36:57.870 --> 00:36:57.880 align:start position:0%
can update us that so there's um my son
 
00:36:59.589 --> 00:36:59.599 align:start position:0%
is that that's a reference to chronic
 
00:37:03.349 --> 00:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
wasting disease um so we do we do annual
 
00:37:05.950 --> 00:37:05.960 align:start position:0%
surveillance in the state um we we
 
00:37:08.349 --> 00:37:08.359 align:start position:0%
typically try and Sample about 400 Deer
 
00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
annually and we'll get deer heads from
 
00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:12.880 align:start position:0%
butchers cooperating butchers throughout
 
00:37:14.589 --> 00:37:14.599 align:start position:0%
the state during the hunting season then
 
00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:16.720 align:start position:0%
our biological staff will remove samples
 
00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:19.240 align:start position:0%
we send those out to a lab for testing
 
00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:21.160 align:start position:0%
um so through our surveillance we also
 
00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
will test um you know any symptomatic
 
00:37:25.109 --> 00:37:25.119 align:start position:0%
animals that the public might might
 
00:37:27.349 --> 00:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
report um through our surveillance we
 
00:37:29.069 --> 00:37:29.079 align:start position:0%
have not detected chronic wasting
 
00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
disease in the state to date um one of
 
00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:33.720 align:start position:0%
the biggest risks of that coming into
 
00:37:36.309 --> 00:37:36.319 align:start position:0%
the state is captive um servid or
 
00:37:37.950 --> 00:37:37.960 align:start position:0%
captive members of the deer family so
 
00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
those are things like um moose white
 
00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
tailed deer mule deer elk Red Deer
 
00:37:45.829 --> 00:37:45.839 align:start position:0%
reindeer those are all species that are
 
00:37:48.069 --> 00:37:48.079 align:start position:0%
susceptible to disease um currently
 
00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
under our import um regulations we do
 
00:37:53.950 --> 00:37:53.960 align:start position:0%
not allow the importation of any servid
 
00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
um that is susceptible to CWD uh we also
 
00:37:58.950 --> 00:37:58.960 align:start position:0%
have restrict on Hunters about what
 
00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
they're allowed to bring back from
 
00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:03.480 align:start position:0%
different served species from CW known
 
00:38:07.150 --> 00:38:07.160 align:start position:0%
CWD positive States um so you can only
 
00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:10.280 align:start position:0%
bring back um you know Taxidermy mounts
 
00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
um essentially it's all low lowrisk
 
00:38:14.309 --> 00:38:14.319 align:start position:0%
tissue samples so things like Meats
 
00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:17.240 align:start position:0%
taxid mounts antlers um cleaned out
 
00:38:20.069 --> 00:38:20.079 align:start position:0%
skulls things like that and it's all um
 
00:38:22.069 --> 00:38:22.079 align:start position:0%
an effort to prevent the introduction of
 
00:38:23.309 --> 00:38:23.319 align:start position:0%
that disease
 
00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:26.280 align:start position:0%
unfortunately um that disease does kind
 
00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
of continue to creep AC across the
 
00:38:30.030 --> 00:38:30.040 align:start position:0%
country the closest that's been to New
 
00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:32.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was Quebec um it was
 
00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
discovered in a captive deer um I
 
00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:36.560 align:start position:0%
believe it was a captive Red Deer farm
 
00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:39.560 align:start position:0%
in Quebec um several years ago um
 
00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:41.720 align:start position:0%
they've done significant testing around
 
00:38:44.829 --> 00:38:44.839 align:start position:0%
that facility um it cost them millions
 
00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
of dollars to do to do additional
 
00:38:49.069 --> 00:38:49.079 align:start position:0%
culling of the herd and testing and
 
00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
fortunately they have not found it in
 
00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
any wild deer in Quebec um New York
 
00:38:56.309 --> 00:38:56.319 align:start position:0%
prior to that was the closest that it
 
00:38:59.550 --> 00:38:59.560 align:start position:0%
had been um um and they had been they
 
00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:02.200 align:start position:0%
had not documented another case of CWD I
 
00:39:04.309 --> 00:39:04.319 align:start position:0%
think since um 2009 or so but
 
00:39:06.910 --> 00:39:06.920 align:start position:0%
unfortunately they just detected another
 
00:39:10.829 --> 00:39:10.839 align:start position:0%
um CWD positive deer in a captive
 
00:39:14.069 --> 00:39:14.079 align:start position:0%
facility thank you
 
00:39:15.829 --> 00:39:15.839 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for taking my
 
00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:19.240 align:start position:0%
question um going back to um purchasing
 
00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
property for um if you find a desirable
 
00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
piece of property where does the capital
 
00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:28.040 align:start position:0%
come from to purchase property
 
00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
so we have the
 
00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
$22.50 um habitat fee um that folks pay
 
00:39:37.390 --> 00:39:37.400 align:start position:0%
on on all their licenses that fee is um
 
00:39:40.349 --> 00:39:40.359 align:start position:0%
it's $2.50 and it's um 20 it's been that
 
00:39:43.349 --> 00:39:43.359 align:start position:0%
way for 25 years um so that is some of
 
00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
the money um a good portion of the money
 
00:39:47.589 --> 00:39:47.599 align:start position:0%
comes from the federal the pr dollars
 
00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
Pitman Robertson dollars um will utilize
 
00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:53.680 align:start position:0%
um we can use um so if we get bargain
 
00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
sales on property um we can use the the
 
00:39:59.589 --> 00:39:59.599 align:start position:0%
sale of those prop properties um um as
 
00:40:01.309 --> 00:40:01.319 align:start position:0%
long as there was no other federal funds
 
00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:02.960 align:start position:0%
used to purchas sometimes we'll get
 
00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:05.160 align:start position:0%
donations which is another thing so land
 
00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:07.880 align:start position:0%
donations um we have had individuals
 
00:40:10.190 --> 00:40:10.200 align:start position:0%
will donate um money on their own to
 
00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
provide match for properties um
 
00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
typically we need to come up with about
 
00:40:16.109 --> 00:40:16.119 align:start position:0%
25% of the cost and then the federal
 
00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:19.160 align:start position:0%
funds cover the rest of it um um but
 
00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
we'll work with other groups like um TNC
 
00:40:24.309 --> 00:40:24.319 align:start position:0%
for society different um um land
 
00:40:26.190 --> 00:40:26.200 align:start position:0%
conservation funds and things to come up
 
00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:33.589 --> 00:40:33.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:36.270 --> 00:40:36.280 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you so much
 
00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:38.430 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you so much
thank

00:40:38.430 --> 00:40:38.440 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:40:46.430 --> 00:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:50.829 --> 00:40:50.839 align:start position:0%
up good morning chairman committee my
 
00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
name is Diane Timmons I have been
 
00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
working for the Department for almost 30
 
00:40:58.309 --> 00:40:58.319 align:start position:0%
years 24 of that was a field biologist
 
00:41:00.510 --> 00:41:00.520 align:start position:0%
started in Keen worked my way to the
 
00:41:03.109 --> 00:41:03.119 align:start position:0%
Lakes Region and then up North for 21
 
00:41:07.069 --> 00:41:07.079 align:start position:0%
years and then uh unfortunately decided
 
00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
that I would take an administrative
 
00:41:10.829 --> 00:41:10.839 align:start position:0%
position and I've been in conquered for
 
00:41:12.589 --> 00:41:12.599 align:start position:0%
the last four it's been a great
 
00:41:15.870 --> 00:41:15.880 align:start position:0%
adventure but so uh my division is the
 
00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:18.040 align:start position:0%
Inland Fisheries division we don't do
 
00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:21.160 align:start position:0%
any Marine we do all the Inland stuff we
 
00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:24.640 align:start position:0%
have um six programs that work
 
00:41:27.829 --> 00:41:27.839 align:start position:0%
underneath me and they include warm
 
00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
water species management cold water
 
00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:31.589 align:start position:0%
water species management cold water
species

00:41:31.589 --> 00:41:31.599 align:start position:0%
species
 
00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:34.680 align:start position:0%
management um Fish Conservation which
 
00:41:38.670 --> 00:41:38.680 align:start position:0%
includes are non-game species so minnows
 
00:41:40.589 --> 00:41:40.599 align:start position:0%
um species of greatest
 
00:41:44.589 --> 00:41:44.599 align:start position:0%
concern um as well as some others eels
 
00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:48.520 align:start position:0%
and anris and kadis fish then we also
 
00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
have fish habitat and then we also have
 
00:41:53.069 --> 00:41:53.079 align:start position:0%
the large lakes program in The Lakes
 
00:41:55.069 --> 00:41:55.079 align:start position:0%
Region which includes our landlock
 
00:41:58.069 --> 00:41:58.079 align:start position:0%
salmon and lake trout programs
 
00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:02.640 align:start position:0%
so I have 39 staff members nine of those
 
00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
are in my biological staff the other are
 
00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:08.800 align:start position:0%
the others are in the Hatchery so I
 
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
oversee both components of Inland
 
00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
Fisheries the um other work that we do
 
00:42:18.670 --> 00:42:18.680 align:start position:0%
Under the biological staff is surveys we
 
00:42:20.549 --> 00:42:20.559 align:start position:0%
go out into different water bodies we
 
00:42:22.910 --> 00:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
look at stream Crossings we work with
 
00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
other state agencies to look and manage
 
00:42:28.910 --> 00:42:28.920 align:start position:0%
as to whether AOSS in should stay or go
 
00:42:30.829 --> 00:42:30.839 align:start position:0%
we work with communities to acquire
 
00:42:34.549 --> 00:42:34.559 align:start position:0%
grants to get those um culs restored or
 
00:42:37.829 --> 00:42:37.839 align:start position:0%
removed and um in the process of doing
 
00:42:40.349 --> 00:42:40.359 align:start position:0%
that obviously looking to improve
 
00:42:44.190 --> 00:42:44.200 align:start position:0%
habitat for fish species also safety for
 
00:42:47.589 --> 00:42:47.599 align:start position:0%
people we also work with universities
 
00:42:50.510 --> 00:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
across the state as well as other states
 
00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
collaborative efforts and in doing that
 
00:42:55.829 --> 00:42:55.839 align:start position:0%
we look at genetics research we look at
 
00:42:58.349 --> 00:42:58.359 align:start position:0%
migration research for various wild brck
 
00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
trout populations Etc just trying to
 
00:43:03.150 --> 00:43:03.160 align:start position:0%
provide opportunities for our Anglers
 
00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:04.640 align:start position:0%
throughout the
 
00:43:08.349 --> 00:43:08.359 align:start position:0%
state we also work on Rural Development
 
00:43:10.510 --> 00:43:10.520 align:start position:0%
and um again with the end goal of
 
00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
managing our species populations while
 
00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
providing recreational opportunities for
 
00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:16.390 align:start position:0%
providing recreational opportunities for
various

00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
various
 
00:43:19.470 --> 00:43:19.480 align:start position:0%
folks and we also look at stocking so
 
00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:21.480 align:start position:0%
the various water bodies that folks
 
00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
angle and we need to get you out maybe
 
00:43:25.470 --> 00:43:25.480 align:start position:0%
we start with a show poool at the
 
00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:27.720 align:start position:0%
Hatchery little bit of interest they
 
00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
really big fish and um anyway so we do
 
00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
the stocking as well across the state so
 
00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:37.000 align:start position:0%
our hatcheries uh we have six of those
 
00:43:39.549 --> 00:43:39.559 align:start position:0%
and four of which are over a hundred
 
00:43:41.589 --> 00:43:41.599 align:start position:0%
years old I should start with all of
 
00:43:45.390 --> 00:43:45.400 align:start position:0%
them are in the historic realm now so uh
 
00:43:49.510 --> 00:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
they four are over 100 one is about 75
 
00:43:52.990 --> 00:43:53.000 align:start position:0%
and the other one is 53 years old so our
 
00:43:55.150 --> 00:43:55.160 align:start position:0%
youngest Hatchery is in Milford our
 
00:43:58.430 --> 00:43:58.440 align:start position:0%
oldest Hatchery is in Warren so we have
 
00:44:01.349 --> 00:44:01.359 align:start position:0%
a quite a diversity of a lot of um
 
00:44:04.270 --> 00:44:04.280 align:start position:0%
infrastructure issues as well as you
 
00:44:07.030 --> 00:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
know trying to maintain our numbers and
 
00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:09.720 align:start position:0%
our stocking targets for folks and
 
00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:11.680 align:start position:0%
speaking of infrastructure if I could
 
00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
digress for one moment I did create a
 
00:44:16.109 --> 00:44:16.119 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet for our infrastructure
 
00:44:18.109 --> 00:44:18.119 align:start position:0%
committee and I can work with danan to
 
00:44:19.589 --> 00:44:19.599 align:start position:0%
make sure you get that because that
 
00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
provides all the land conservation who
 
00:44:25.470 --> 00:44:25.480 align:start position:0%
it is what it is and where it is and we
 
00:44:28.109 --> 00:44:28.119 align:start position:0%
can I can get that to you
 
00:44:31.309 --> 00:44:31.319 align:start position:0%
um so one of the other things that we
 
00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:33.680 align:start position:0%
are working on I'm sure most of you have
 
00:44:36.309 --> 00:44:36.319 align:start position:0%
heard about it is the arpa project for
 
00:44:38.069 --> 00:44:38.079 align:start position:0%
the New Hampton Fish Hatchery
 
00:44:40.990 --> 00:44:41.000 align:start position:0%
modernization effort um I'm happy to say
 
00:44:43.510 --> 00:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
that yesterday I was at a site team
 
00:44:45.990 --> 00:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
meeting and in the background was a
 
00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
bunch of excavators dismantling
 
00:44:50.829 --> 00:44:50.839 align:start position:0%
equipment so we are officially breaking
 
00:44:53.309 --> 00:44:53.319 align:start position:0%
ground which is pretty exciting um it's
 
00:44:56.510 --> 00:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
a going to be a fantastic facility uh
 
00:44:58.670 --> 00:44:58.680 align:start position:0%
right now at New Hampton we produce
 
00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:01.960 align:start position:0%
about 75,000 lb uh currently it's
 
00:45:04.549 --> 00:45:04.559 align:start position:0%
completely closed there are no fish on
 
00:45:08.589 --> 00:45:08.599 align:start position:0%
station for anybody to see um and they
 
00:45:10.309 --> 00:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
that will take about two years to get
 
00:45:12.150 --> 00:45:12.160 align:start position:0%
the project completed but in that
 
00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
process we will more than double our
 
00:45:17.069 --> 00:45:17.079 align:start position:0%
capacity at that particular location it
 
00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
will have heavy
 
00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:22.640 align:start position:0%
duty heavy duty filtration and um it
 
00:45:24.990 --> 00:45:25.000 align:start position:0%
will actually be our best hatchery in
 
00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:27.720 align:start position:0%
the state as far as meeting our
 
00:45:31.109 --> 00:45:31.119 align:start position:0%
compliance with their nipes permits for
 
00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
various phosphorus and um nitrogen
 
00:45:36.069 --> 00:45:36.079 align:start position:0%
limits that we currently struggle with
 
00:45:39.549 --> 00:45:39.559 align:start position:0%
at this point so and with that um Randy
 
00:45:41.950 --> 00:45:41.960 align:start position:0%
had mentioned we do work with Randy and
 
00:45:45.870 --> 00:45:45.880 align:start position:0%
Kathy on various grants and um also with
 
00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
our various non-governmental
 
00:45:50.589 --> 00:45:50.599 align:start position:0%
organization partners and other state
 
00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
agency partners to get a bunch of work
 
00:45:55.349 --> 00:45:55.359 align:start position:0%
done because we can't do it all under
 
00:45:58.190 --> 00:45:58.200 align:start position:0%
our current budget so that helps and
 
00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:00.760 align:start position:0%
it's a great collaboration and
 
00:46:02.549 --> 00:46:02.559 align:start position:0%
Partnerships but that I'll take any
 
00:46:05.870 --> 00:46:05.880 align:start position:0%
questions any questions representative
 
00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
oulette thank you for taking my question
 
00:46:10.030 --> 00:46:10.040 align:start position:0%
sure um it's nice to hear about the New
 
00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:12.880 align:start position:0%
Hampton project and um a lot was done
 
00:46:15.790 --> 00:46:15.800 align:start position:0%
with the pow Mill project yes and um I
 
00:46:17.230 --> 00:46:17.240 align:start position:0%
know they're very expensive but do you
 
00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
have a long-term plan to to Really
 
00:46:23.790 --> 00:46:23.800 align:start position:0%
redo the others there are some that are
 
00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
very deteriorated in this state and
 
00:46:27.790 --> 00:46:27.800 align:start position:0%
they're kind of embarrassing
 
00:46:31.309 --> 00:46:31.319 align:start position:0%
all of them are so um I would my answer
 
00:46:33.870 --> 00:46:33.880 align:start position:0%
to you is absolutely so the hatcheries
 
00:46:36.589 --> 00:46:36.599 align:start position:0%
are in locations where they are for
 
00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
various efficiency purposes so we have
 
00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
um hatcheries in the north hatchery in
 
00:46:45.349 --> 00:46:45.359 align:start position:0%
well Hatchery is in the north Hatcher's
 
00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
in the south of course Central and then
 
00:46:52.630 --> 00:46:52.640 align:start position:0%
east and west and so as we go through
 
00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
the progress and the and the future and
 
00:46:57.990 --> 00:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
as this comes about we'll be really
 
00:47:00.589 --> 00:47:00.599 align:start position:0%
analyzing how we can make this work with
 
00:47:02.109 --> 00:47:02.119 align:start position:0%
the budgets that we have and the
 
00:47:04.309 --> 00:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
struggles with we have with you know
 
00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
getting these things repaired or
 
00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
replaced uh the New Hampton project we
 
00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:11.680 align:start position:0%
started out with a 25 million estimate
 
00:47:14.270 --> 00:47:14.280 align:start position:0%
and ended up with a $58 million final
 
00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
project so it it's very very much
 
00:47:20.390 --> 00:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
expensive and um but we'll be looking at
 
00:47:22.030 --> 00:47:22.040 align:start position:0%
all of that at this point that's our
 
00:47:24.670 --> 00:47:24.680 align:start position:0%
plan is to just kind of come up with a
 
00:47:28.190 --> 00:47:28.200 align:start position:0%
program where we can keep what we
 
00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
can follow up thank
 
00:47:35.069 --> 00:47:35.079 align:start position:0%
you who's uh who's next on your target I
 
00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
have no
 
00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
idea no in all honesty powdermill is not
 
00:47:42.910 --> 00:47:42.920 align:start position:0%
going away it's our best water source so
 
00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
we're hoping that we can get funding but
 
00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
of course arpa is uh probably a once in
 
00:47:52.270 --> 00:47:52.280 align:start position:0%
my career opportunity so we'd be looking
 
00:47:55.030 --> 00:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
for uh major funding sources elsewhere
 
00:47:57.230 --> 00:47:57.240 align:start position:0%
but Powder Mill is probably our next
 
00:47:59.750 --> 00:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
just cuz it was our largest facility it
 
00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
covers the largest geographic area and
 
00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
right now it's uh less than a third of
 
00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
its production due to permitting
 
00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
issues representative Harvey do you do
 
00:48:15.230 --> 00:48:15.240 align:start position:0%
you get money then from
 
00:48:21.549 --> 00:48:21.559 align:start position:0%
Dingle I get money yes yes from DJ funds
 
00:48:24.549 --> 00:48:24.559 align:start position:0%
yep any other questions if I could
 
00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
follow up on that so just so you know so
 
00:48:28.030 --> 00:48:28.040 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit different than
 
00:48:31.390 --> 00:48:31.400 align:start position:0%
wildlife in that we're a New Hampshire's
 
00:48:34.510 --> 00:48:34.520 align:start position:0%
a minimal state so my capacity to get
 
00:48:38.430 --> 00:48:38.440 align:start position:0%
funding is much less than it is for um
 
00:48:41.150 --> 00:48:41.160 align:start position:0%
excuse me for wildlife so just so folks
 
00:48:42.309 --> 00:48:42.319 align:start position:0%
understand they are two different
 
00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
funding mechanisms and the programs and
 
00:48:46.829 --> 00:48:46.839 align:start position:0%
the capacities of each program is
 
00:48:49.349 --> 00:48:49.359 align:start position:0%
different so our Fisheries money the
 
00:48:52.109 --> 00:48:52.119 align:start position:0%
taxes that come in on that money is much
 
00:48:54.510 --> 00:48:54.520 align:start position:0%
less than the money that comes in from
 
00:48:57.470 --> 00:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
big guns and bullets and that type of
 
00:48:59.109 --> 00:48:59.119 align:start position:0%
stuff so Fisheries
 
00:49:01.910 --> 00:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
unfortunately is a much less pot much
 
00:49:04.190 --> 00:49:04.200 align:start position:0%
lower pot to pick
 
00:49:08.430 --> 00:49:08.440 align:start position:0%
from thank you any other questions I
 
00:49:10.710 --> 00:49:10.720 align:start position:0%
have one myself sure the new filtration
 
00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
that's heavy duty yes did we end up
 
00:49:14.349 --> 00:49:14.359 align:start position:0%
going with a mechanical chemical
 
00:49:16.829 --> 00:49:16.839 align:start position:0%
filtration or did we go with an organic
 
00:49:19.549 --> 00:49:19.559 align:start position:0%
we went with a dinos Sand Filtration so
 
00:49:21.789 --> 00:49:21.799 align:start position:0%
it's well it's both so we have heavy
 
00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:24.880 align:start position:0%
duty filters that first start the
 
00:49:27.349 --> 00:49:27.359 align:start position:0%
process and then it goes through
 
00:49:30.309 --> 00:49:30.319 align:start position:0%
Sand Filtration that use utilizes
 
00:49:33.710 --> 00:49:33.720 align:start position:0%
aluminum to bind to the phosphorus the
 
00:49:36.589 --> 00:49:36.599 align:start position:0%
solids and then remove it from there
 
00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
thanks yep seeing no other questions
 
00:49:41.230 --> 00:49:41.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your time today
 
00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:42.030 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your time today
thank

00:49:42.030 --> 00:49:42.040 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:49:47.950 --> 00:49:47.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:51.270 --> 00:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
up are we ending with you Colonel I
 
00:49:52.630 --> 00:49:52.640 align:start position:0%
believe the commission is going to come
 
00:49:54.829 --> 00:49:54.839 align:start position:0%
behind me but yes she was unsure if she
 
00:49:56.789 --> 00:49:56.799 align:start position:0%
would be able to sneak over here but I
 
00:49:58.510 --> 00:49:58.520 align:start position:0%
her an open invitation for all day long
 
00:50:01.870 --> 00:50:01.880 align:start position:0%
so she perfect perfect uh yes our
 
00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
director currently is at governor and
 
00:50:06.150 --> 00:50:06.160 align:start position:0%
Council I believe but her her goal is to
 
00:50:08.589 --> 00:50:08.599 align:start position:0%
get here uh at some point so I'm going
 
00:50:10.390 --> 00:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
to represent two divisions today the
 
00:50:12.510 --> 00:50:12.520 align:start position:0%
Marine Division I'll start with because
 
00:50:15.789 --> 00:50:15.799 align:start position:0%
our Marine Division Chief uh is away
 
00:50:17.950 --> 00:50:17.960 align:start position:0%
with a lot of her staff at a conference
 
00:50:20.670 --> 00:50:20.680 align:start position:0%
in Washington DC so I asked her to give
 
00:50:22.270 --> 00:50:22.280 align:start position:0%
me some notes so please forgive me I'm
 
00:50:24.190 --> 00:50:24.200 align:start position:0%
going to read what she's given me here
 
00:50:26.109 --> 00:50:26.119 align:start position:0%
but a marine divisions Fisheries
 
00:50:27.870 --> 00:50:27.880 align:start position:0%
division is responsible for managing
 
00:50:30.150 --> 00:50:30.160 align:start position:0%

Coastal Waters the harbors and the
 
00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:36.240 align:start position:0%

understanding of some important species
 
00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
the division conducts research
 
00:51:12.829 --> 00:51:12.839 align:start position:0%
collaboratively with those Partners uh

00:52:08.349 --> 00:52:08.359 align:start position:0%
uh maintaining or improving habitat
 
00:52:10.030 --> 00:52:10.040 align:start position:0%

Great Bay
 
00:52:14.549 --> 00:52:14.559 align:start position:0%
Watershed so that's the Marine Division
 
00:52:16.069 --> 00:52:16.079 align:start position:0%
and that would be Sheree Patterson that
 
00:52:20.109 --> 00:52:20.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:20.119 --> 00:52:21.789 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

00:52:21.789 --> 00:52:21.799 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:52:23.870 --> 00:52:23.880 align:start position:0%
questions are you doing he I'm sure
 
00:52:25.549 --> 00:52:25.559 align:start position:0%
he'll do his best to answer for Sheree
 
00:52:27.109 --> 00:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
if you've got a question for for that
 
00:52:29.589 --> 00:52:29.599 align:start position:0%
right uh so I that was my question for
 
00:52:31.870 --> 00:52:31.880 align:start position:0%
you was are you taking it at after each
 
00:52:34.309 --> 00:52:34.319 align:start position:0%
division or after he's totally we can do
 
00:52:36.270 --> 00:52:36.280 align:start position:0%
it after each division so if you'd like
 
00:52:38.789 --> 00:52:38.799 align:start position:0%
to ask your question go ahead thank you
 
00:52:42.750 --> 00:52:42.760 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair so um oh shoot now
 
00:52:46.829 --> 00:52:46.839 align:start position:0%
my oh yes I know um f first of all um
 
00:52:49.030 --> 00:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
the Great Bay Estuary is a wonderful
 
00:52:51.230 --> 00:52:51.240 align:start position:0%
place and Once Upon a Time our committee
 
00:52:54.109 --> 00:52:54.119 align:start position:0%
visited and it was it's fantastic but my
 
00:52:56.870 --> 00:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
question is um I couldn't write fast
 
00:52:59.549 --> 00:52:59.559 align:start position:0%
enough Atlantic state marine fisheries
 
00:53:03.150 --> 00:53:03.160 align:start position:0%
and there was another um uh so it works
 
00:53:06.349 --> 00:53:06.359 align:start position:0%
in conjunction with uh Atlantic State's
 
00:53:08.870 --> 00:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
marine fisheries commission and then New
 
00:53:10.950 --> 00:53:10.960 align:start position:0%
England fisheries management
 
00:53:16.270 --> 00:53:16.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:18.750 --> 00:53:18.760 align:start position:0%
decisions any other
 
00:53:21.109 --> 00:53:21.119 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none you can go ahead
 
00:53:22.829 --> 00:53:22.839 align:start position:0%
with your own now yeah so now this is
 
00:53:24.150 --> 00:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
one I do know a little something about
 
00:53:26.589 --> 00:53:26.599 align:start position:0%
it's a law division uh it's the largest
 
00:53:28.430 --> 00:53:28.440 align:start position:0%
division in the agency and if you
 
00:53:29.870 --> 00:53:29.880 align:start position:0%
haven't figured out as we've been going
 
00:53:32.390 --> 00:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
through this uh this is a heck of a team
 
00:53:35.150 --> 00:53:35.160 align:start position:0%
over there um you know if you enjoy the
 
00:53:37.069 --> 00:53:37.079 align:start position:0%
deer population that we haven't seen
 
00:53:39.190 --> 00:53:39.200 align:start position:0%
since I was a kid that's because of Dan
 
00:53:42.069 --> 00:53:42.079 align:start position:0%
and his team if you enjoy good fishing
 
00:53:43.630 --> 00:53:43.640 align:start position:0%
opportunities which I know a lot of you
 
00:53:45.710 --> 00:53:45.720 align:start position:0%
do that's we can thank Diane and her
 
00:53:48.470 --> 00:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
team Kathy Keeps Us squared away and
 
00:53:50.190 --> 00:53:50.200 align:start position:0%
pays our bills and makees sure I can buy
 
00:53:52.870 --> 00:53:52.880 align:start position:0%
equipment for my staff which is critical
 
00:53:54.870 --> 00:53:54.880 align:start position:0%
for our function Randy gets US Federal
 
00:53:57.109 --> 00:53:57.119 align:start position:0%
money when we can't get State money
 
00:53:59.910 --> 00:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
um so without this group working
 
00:54:01.630 --> 00:54:01.640 align:start position:0%
together and Nicola puts out all of our
 
00:54:03.230 --> 00:54:03.240 align:start position:0%
press releases that you're going to see
 
00:54:05.750 --> 00:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
if you haven't seen um and does all of
 
00:54:08.390 --> 00:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
our public education so it is a good
 
00:54:10.190 --> 00:54:10.200 align:start position:0%
working unit over there with a very it's
 
00:54:12.910 --> 00:54:12.920 align:start position:0%
a very close family frankly uh and I
 
00:54:15.390 --> 00:54:15.400 align:start position:0%
feel very fortunate to be a part of it
 
00:54:17.349 --> 00:54:17.359 align:start position:0%
so in the law division we have 48
 
00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
full-time positions uh to cover the
 
00:54:22.710 --> 00:54:22.720 align:start position:0%
entire state currently we have 38
 
00:54:25.710 --> 00:54:25.720 align:start position:0%
working in the field as field officers
 
00:54:27.710 --> 00:54:27.720 align:start position:0%
um I have four headquarters staff the
 
00:54:29.190 --> 00:54:29.200 align:start position:0%
colonel major Captain and an
 
00:54:30.750 --> 00:54:30.760 align:start position:0%
administrative Lieutenant everybody else
 
00:54:33.789 --> 00:54:33.799 align:start position:0%
is in the field uh right now we have six
 
00:54:36.230 --> 00:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
openings that we're trying to
 
00:54:38.589 --> 00:54:38.599 align:start position:0%
fill um just to give you an idea the
 
00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:40.720 align:start position:0%
city of conquer has 70 police officers
 
00:54:42.109 --> 00:54:42.119 align:start position:0%
to cover the city and we're trying to do
 
00:54:46.549 --> 00:54:46.559 align:start position:0%
the entire state with 38 um so we're wul
 
00:54:49.990 --> 00:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
short um we enforce all hunting fishing
 
00:54:51.990 --> 00:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
and trapping regulations Statewide we
 
00:54:54.710 --> 00:54:54.720 align:start position:0%
have six uh districts within our state
 
00:54:56.829 --> 00:54:56.839 align:start position:0%
and each district has a lieutenant and a
 
00:54:58.910 --> 00:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
sergeant and field officers those
 
00:55:01.190 --> 00:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
districts start in Coos County and work
 
00:55:03.109 --> 00:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
their way down to the coast so we cover
 
00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:05.440 align:start position:0%
everything from uh the Canadian border
 
00:55:07.349 --> 00:55:07.359 align:start position:0%
to the mass border to the main border
 
00:55:08.710 --> 00:55:08.720 align:start position:0%
and over to
 
00:55:10.950 --> 00:55:10.960 align:start position:0%
Vermont we also have motor vehicle
 
00:55:12.750 --> 00:55:12.760 align:start position:0%
powers to enforce Motor Vehicle Laws
 
00:55:15.430 --> 00:55:15.440 align:start position:0%
although we I kind of discourage that
 
00:55:16.950 --> 00:55:16.960 align:start position:0%
unless they see something that's an
 
00:55:19.710 --> 00:55:19.720 align:start position:0%
emergency somebody driving impaired or
 
00:55:21.349 --> 00:55:21.359 align:start position:0%
someone driving recklessly I don't want
 
00:55:23.750 --> 00:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
them out running radar um because we
 
00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
have many more other things that we want
 
00:55:27.510 --> 00:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
them doing but they do have that
 
00:55:29.549 --> 00:55:29.559 align:start position:0%
Authority they're very active in
 
00:55:32.150 --> 00:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
community policing roles we do a lot of
 
00:55:33.670 --> 00:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
presentations and a lot of community
 
00:55:35.750 --> 00:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
events I I think that's a valuable
 
00:55:38.549 --> 00:55:38.559 align:start position:0%
service and fishing game historically
 
00:55:40.390 --> 00:55:40.400 align:start position:0%
was not real active in that we have
 
00:55:42.630 --> 00:55:42.640 align:start position:0%
become a lot more active I I think
 
00:55:45.670 --> 00:55:45.680 align:start position:0%
that's an important piece we handle most
 
00:55:47.309 --> 00:55:47.319 align:start position:0%
of the nuisance animal calls that are
 
00:55:48.750 --> 00:55:48.760 align:start position:0%
receiv received throughout the state
 
00:55:51.470 --> 00:55:51.480 align:start position:0%
everything from a uh from a groundhog in
 
00:55:53.870 --> 00:55:53.880 align:start position:0%
my garden to a bear on my front
 
00:55:57.069 --> 00:55:57.079 align:start position:0%
porch uh along with real Good Help from
 
00:55:59.789 --> 00:55:59.799 align:start position:0%
the wildlife staff on those issues we do
 
00:56:02.029 --> 00:56:02.039 align:start position:0%
all the rabies investigations we process
 
00:56:03.990 --> 00:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
suspected animals and transport them for
 
00:56:06.270 --> 00:56:06.280 align:start position:0%
testing when someone has a bad encounter
 
00:56:09.150 --> 00:56:09.160 align:start position:0%
with a with a wild animal we enforce all
 
00:56:11.870 --> 00:56:11.880 align:start position:0%
the ATV and OHV laws so we Patrol on
 
00:56:14.109 --> 00:56:14.119 align:start position:0%
snow machines and ATVs and dirt bikes as
 
00:56:16.109 --> 00:56:16.119 align:start position:0%
we talked about earlier to enforce speed
 
00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
regulations on our Trail systems we we
 
00:56:22.309 --> 00:56:22.319 align:start position:0%
monitor for registration uh compliance
 
00:56:24.589 --> 00:56:24.599 align:start position:0%
and we cover all the off Highway uh
 
00:56:26.910 --> 00:56:26.920 align:start position:0%
recreational accidents that
 
00:56:29.470 --> 00:56:29.480 align:start position:0%
occur we participate in all the outdoor
 
00:56:31.270 --> 00:56:31.280 align:start position:0%
education classes to include hunter
 
00:56:33.829 --> 00:56:33.839 align:start position:0%
safety trapping safety OHV safety
 
00:56:36.430 --> 00:56:36.440 align:start position:0%
classes and the letx go fishing programs
 
00:56:37.910 --> 00:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
as well as the becoming an outdoor
 
00:56:40.349 --> 00:56:40.359 align:start position:0%
woman's program uh there are law

segments in each one of those and we
 
00:56:44.109 --> 00:56:44.119 align:start position:0%
have officers go in uh at the various
 
00:56:47.109 --> 00:56:47.119 align:start position:0%
programs to teach we do the Inland

used to when I was younger yeah you know
 
00:57:10.150 --> 00:57:10.160 align:start position:0%
it's a difference between fishing and
 
00:57:13.029 --> 00:57:13.039 align:start position:0%
pulling in hornpout right there you
 
00:57:16.750 --> 00:57:16.760 align:start position:0%
go uh we do a lot on the coast um we do
 
00:57:18.470 --> 00:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of coastal enforcement we work in
 
00:57:20.230 --> 00:57:20.240 align:start position:0%
partnership with marine fisheries as
 
00:57:22.270 --> 00:57:22.280 align:start position:0%
well as Noah National Oceanic
 
00:57:24.069 --> 00:57:24.079 align:start position:0%
Atmospheric Administration to Monitor
 
00:57:26.270 --> 00:57:26.280 align:start position:0%
and enforce commercial fishing laws
 
00:57:29.230 --> 00:57:29.240 align:start position:0%
Randy uh helps us with federal grants we
 
00:57:31.109 --> 00:57:31.119 align:start position:0%
receive we average about a half a
 
00:57:32.670 --> 00:57:32.680 align:start position:0%
million quarter to a half a million
 
00:57:34.829 --> 00:57:34.839 align:start position:0%
dollars every year from the feds to
 
00:57:37.309 --> 00:57:37.319 align:start position:0%
enforce uh Coastal regulations which is
 
00:57:38.829 --> 00:57:38.839 align:start position:0%
a big savings for the State of New
 
00:57:40.670 --> 00:57:40.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we use that money to purchase
 
00:57:42.870 --> 00:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
valuable equipment and to equip and pay
 
00:57:45.589 --> 00:57:45.599 align:start position:0%
our officers to be down there we work we
 
00:57:47.150 --> 00:57:47.160 align:start position:0%
enforce all the commercial Fisheries
 
00:57:50.270 --> 00:57:50.280 align:start position:0%
along the laws along the coast we have
 
00:57:51.870 --> 00:57:51.880 align:start position:0%
multiple watercraft down there that we
 
00:57:53.510 --> 00:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
use to patrol and conduct searches in
 
00:57:55.470 --> 00:57:55.480 align:start position:0%
the ocean waterways to include two
 
00:57:57.670 --> 00:57:57.680 align:start position:0%
substantial safe boat crafts for foul
 
00:58:00.270 --> 00:58:00.280 align:start position:0%
weather on the ocean all of the officers
 
00:58:02.750 --> 00:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
down there go to extensive training and
 
00:58:04.789 --> 00:58:04.799 align:start position:0%
are certified in the operation of those
 
00:58:07.029 --> 00:58:07.039 align:start position:0%
boats as well as Marine law enforcement
 
00:58:08.990 --> 00:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement from our federal partners by
 
00:58:10.990 --> 00:58:11.000 align:start position:0%
attending the federal law enforcement
 
00:58:13.430 --> 00:58:13.440 align:start position:0%
training center in Glenco Georgia so
 
00:58:15.589 --> 00:58:15.599 align:start position:0%
they're well trained in the operation of
 
00:58:16.710 --> 00:58:16.720 align:start position:0%
those bigger
 
00:58:18.829 --> 00:58:18.839 align:start position:0%
boats one thing we're probably most
 
00:58:21.349 --> 00:58:21.359 align:start position:0%
known for is search and rescue Statewide
 
00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
anything from Lost persons to carry out
 
00:58:26.109 --> 00:58:26.119 align:start position:0%
for injured hikers uh we cover all the
 
00:58:28.589 --> 00:58:28.599 align:start position:0%
walkways The Runaways basically anything
 
00:58:30.430 --> 00:58:30.440 align:start position:0%
that occurs off the highways in the
 
00:58:32.510 --> 00:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
state become our responsibility things
 
00:58:34.789 --> 00:58:34.799 align:start position:0%
like plane CL crashes major flooding
 
00:58:37.670 --> 00:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
events or weather events and we are very
 
00:58:39.349 --> 00:58:39.359 align:start position:0%
active over at New Hampshire Emergency
 
00:58:41.230 --> 00:58:41.240 align:start position:0%
Operations Center as the lead in the
 
00:58:44.309 --> 00:58:44.319 align:start position:0%
state for search and rescue
 
00:58:46.549 --> 00:58:46.559 align:start position:0%
operations uh we have a number of
 
00:58:48.109 --> 00:58:48.119 align:start position:0%
specialized teams I'll just touch on
 
00:58:49.589 --> 00:58:49.599 align:start position:0%
them quickly we have an advanced search
 
00:58:51.309 --> 00:58:51.319 align:start position:0%
and rescue team which is a group of
 
00:58:53.390 --> 00:58:53.400 align:start position:0%
officers that we have trained at at
 
00:58:55.390 --> 00:58:55.400 align:start position:0%
levels far above the normal game warden
 
00:58:57.910 --> 00:58:57.920 align:start position:0%
to go above Tree Line in in adverse
 
00:59:00.510 --> 00:59:00.520 align:start position:0%
weather as they just did Sunday night
 
00:59:02.270 --> 00:59:02.280 align:start position:0%
that you I'm sure you saw in the news we
 
00:59:05.589 --> 00:59:05.599 align:start position:0%
have the only state dive team even
 
00:59:06.829 --> 00:59:06.839 align:start position:0%
though we're called New Hampshire State
 
00:59:08.710 --> 00:59:08.720 align:start position:0%
Police dive team on the news on on
 
00:59:10.510 --> 00:59:10.520 align:start position:0%
occasion it's very frustrating because
 
00:59:12.910 --> 00:59:12.920 align:start position:0%
we have the only team fishing game has a
 
00:59:15.430 --> 00:59:15.440 align:start position:0%
dive recovery team we just recently
 
00:59:17.029 --> 00:59:17.039 align:start position:0%
finished uh purchasing a
 
00:59:19.029 --> 00:59:19.039 align:start position:0%
state-of-the-art trailer with the
 
00:59:20.829 --> 00:59:20.839 align:start position:0%
ability to fill our own tanks at the
 
00:59:22.549 --> 00:59:22.559 align:start position:0%
scene which has been a big bonus it's
 
00:59:24.230 --> 00:59:24.240 align:start position:0%
been a project of mine since I became
 
00:59:27.510 --> 00:59:27.520 align:start position:0%
the colonel and we have that now so um
 
00:59:30.270 --> 00:59:30.280 align:start position:0%
we have some really Advanced uh diving
 
00:59:32.190 --> 00:59:32.200 align:start position:0%
equipment and some good divers these
 
00:59:33.750 --> 00:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
divers are trained to dive in all
 
00:59:36.150 --> 00:59:36.160 align:start position:0%
conditions including under the ice uh
 
00:59:38.589 --> 00:59:38.599 align:start position:0%
which is incredibly dangerous we have an
 
00:59:40.670 --> 00:59:40.680 align:start position:0%
airboat rescue team with two airboats
 
00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
that were purchased through Homeland
 
00:59:43.950 --> 00:59:43.960 align:start position:0%
Security so those are boats that will go
 
00:59:46.349 --> 00:59:46.359 align:start position:0%
out on thin ice uh and travel across
 
00:59:48.670 --> 00:59:48.680 align:start position:0%
land and in flood conditions so we use
 
00:59:50.710 --> 00:59:50.720 align:start position:0%
those a number of times I have a team of
 
00:59:53.029 --> 00:59:53.039 align:start position:0%
officers trained to operate those we've
 
00:59:55.470 --> 00:59:55.480 align:start position:0%
been able to achieve five currently K9
 
00:59:57.109 --> 00:59:57.119 align:start position:0%
teams which which I'm very proud of I'm
 
00:59:58.829 --> 00:59:58.839 align:start position:0%
very proud of all of these people I got
 
01:00:01.390 --> 01:00:01.400 align:start position:0%
to tell you I I uh say it all the time
 
01:00:02.910 --> 01:00:02.920 align:start position:0%
they're the best people in the world to
 
01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
work with I have men and women now I'm
 
01:00:07.829 --> 01:00:07.839 align:start position:0%
very happy to say I have three of the uh
 
01:00:10.029 --> 01:00:10.039 align:start position:0%
three female officers that are absolute
 
01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:12.119 align:start position:0%
firecrackers and uh they are given the
 
01:00:15.109 --> 01:00:15.119 align:start position:0%
boys will run for their money um and one
 
01:00:17.589 --> 01:00:17.599 align:start position:0%
of them is is on that uh looking to be
 
01:00:19.750 --> 01:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
on that K9 team but our K9 team is
 
01:00:22.270 --> 01:00:22.280 align:start position:0%
called by all kinds of state agencies
 
01:00:24.190 --> 01:00:24.200 align:start position:0%
we've been involved in many high-profile
 
01:00:27.390 --> 01:00:27.400 align:start position:0%
homicide cases was rc9 that found the
 
01:00:28.789 --> 01:00:28.799 align:start position:0%
murder weapon for that young man that
 
01:00:30.390 --> 01:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
murdered his family in Northfield and
 
01:00:32.789 --> 01:00:32.799 align:start position:0%
drove down 93 and threw the gun out in
 
01:00:35.190 --> 01:00:35.200 align:start position:0%
the medium I had two canines that spent
 
01:00:36.750 --> 01:00:36.760 align:start position:0%
three days going up and down the medium
 
01:00:38.430 --> 01:00:38.440 align:start position:0%
of the highway and they found the gun
 
01:00:40.950 --> 01:00:40.960 align:start position:0%
that led to the arrests they also played
 
01:00:42.589 --> 01:00:42.599 align:start position:0%
a pivotal role in the conquered
 
01:00:44.549 --> 01:00:44.559 align:start position:0%
homicides the double homicides for the
 
01:00:46.549 --> 01:00:46.559 align:start position:0%
folks walking on the trail they found
 
01:00:48.150 --> 01:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
all the evidence that was used in that
 
01:00:50.430 --> 01:00:50.440 align:start position:0%
conviction so these dogs I'm very proud
 
01:00:52.150 --> 01:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
of these dogs they're not bite dogs
 
01:00:54.470 --> 01:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
they're search dogs uh and they're very
 
01:00:56.829 --> 01:00:56.839 align:start position:0%
good at at what they do
 
01:00:58.710 --> 01:00:58.720 align:start position:0%
we have an honor guard team which we use
 
01:01:01.029 --> 01:01:01.039 align:start position:0%
in formal ceremonies and flag folding a
 
01:01:03.190 --> 01:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
flag folding team that joins with them
 
01:01:05.470 --> 01:01:05.480 align:start position:0%
we have a sidescan sonar team which is a
 
01:01:08.510 --> 01:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
specialized technical equipment used for
 
01:01:10.069 --> 01:01:10.079 align:start position:0%
underwater searching it's some of the
 
01:01:12.069 --> 01:01:12.079 align:start position:0%
most advanced underwater searching that
 
01:01:13.950 --> 01:01:13.960 align:start position:0%
exists today I have an officer who's
 
01:01:16.309 --> 01:01:16.319 align:start position:0%
very good at it uh he solved a couple of
 
01:01:18.029 --> 01:01:18.039 align:start position:0%
coal cases when we were missing people
 
01:01:20.430 --> 01:01:20.440 align:start position:0%
for over 30 years he was able to locate
 
01:01:22.829 --> 01:01:22.839 align:start position:0%
them using this equipment uh this
 
01:01:25.230 --> 01:01:25.240 align:start position:0%
involves uh radar searching under the
 
01:01:27.470 --> 01:01:27.480 align:start position:0%
water as well as uh remote Vehicles
 
01:01:30.109 --> 01:01:30.119 align:start position:0%
operating with cameras on board to to
 
01:01:33.230 --> 01:01:33.240 align:start position:0%
search we have a drone team which is a
 
01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:36.119 align:start position:0%
new team uh I have four individuals
 
01:01:38.710 --> 01:01:38.720 align:start position:0%
including two pilots that fly drones for
 
01:01:40.789 --> 01:01:40.799 align:start position:0%
search and rescue we're starting to get
 
01:01:43.510 --> 01:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
into that is using a drone to as another
 
01:01:46.069 --> 01:01:46.079 align:start position:0%
resource for search missions we have
 
01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
cameras uh night vision cameras that are
 
01:01:50.230 --> 01:01:50.240 align:start position:0%
mounted on this and GPS navigation
 
01:01:52.510 --> 01:01:52.520 align:start position:0%
equipment um and then finally we have a
 
01:01:55.069 --> 01:01:55.079 align:start position:0%
ja which is a joint enforcement team of
 
01:01:56.950 --> 01:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
officers train throughout the state to
 
01:01:59.670 --> 01:01:59.680 align:start position:0%
go down and work on our Coastline as the
 
01:02:01.109 --> 01:02:01.119 align:start position:0%
the rules and laws down there are
 
01:02:04.349 --> 01:02:04.359 align:start position:0%
complicated so it takes a uh in advance
 
01:02:06.430 --> 01:02:06.440 align:start position:0%
training really to be effective with
 
01:02:07.670 --> 01:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
that and we have a group of officers
 
01:02:09.309 --> 01:02:09.319 align:start position:0%
that have taken on that additional
 
01:02:12.710 --> 01:02:12.720 align:start position:0%
challenge so in a nutshell that's that's
 
01:02:14.789 --> 01:02:14.799 align:start position:0%
uh the law enforcement
 
01:02:17.309 --> 01:02:17.319 align:start position:0%

had six openings is that going to be an
 
01:03:12.069 --> 01:03:12.079 align:start position:0%
addition to the 48 or are those that
 
01:03:13.950 --> 01:03:13.960 align:start position:0%
would be the total of 48 so right now I
 
01:03:17.029 --> 01:03:17.039 align:start position:0%
have 42 total but we have we're funded

01:03:48.670 --> 01:03:48.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire fishing game when I get

agencies lose them we don't do that um
 
01:03:55.990 --> 01:03:56.000 align:start position:0%

01:04:11.029 --> 01:04:11.039 align:start position:0%
Harvey is your equipment included in the
 
01:04:14.430 --> 01:04:14.440 align:start position:0%
inventory that I asked about earlier yes
 
01:04:17.990 --> 01:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
so we have we put uh numbers practically
 
01:04:19.789 --> 01:04:19.799 align:start position:0%
on everything that we own with the
 
01:04:22.069 --> 01:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
exception of consumables so cuz our
 
01:04:24.870 --> 01:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
officers this division is equipped
 
01:04:27.150 --> 01:04:27.160 align:start position:0%
really from head to toe toe uh takes 2
 
01:04:29.390 --> 01:04:29.400 align:start position:0%
days to outfit a new officer with all
 
01:04:31.069 --> 01:04:31.079 align:start position:0%
the equipment so that equipment is
 
01:04:33.430 --> 01:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
tracked annually they're responsible for
 
01:04:36.029 --> 01:04:36.039 align:start position:0%
their own equipment so an officer can be
 
01:04:38.510 --> 01:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
issued a boat or or more than one boat
 
01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
depending on his Patrol he'll be issued
 
01:04:43.150 --> 01:04:43.160 align:start position:0%
an ATV and or a motorcycle depending on
 
01:04:45.190 --> 01:04:45.200 align:start position:0%
his Patrol a snow machine a four-wheel
 
01:04:48.829 --> 01:04:48.839 align:start position:0%
drive Cruiser uh and tons of search and
 
01:04:51.910 --> 01:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
rescue equipment and uniforms guns and
 
01:04:54.950 --> 01:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
all of that equipment is is very closely
 
01:04:58.349 --> 01:04:58.359 align:start position:0%
monitored yes thank you followup please
 
01:05:01.269 --> 01:05:01.279 align:start position:0%
followup uh I forget the name of the
 
01:05:04.069 --> 01:05:04.079 align:start position:0%
program um that was on television
 
01:05:06.549 --> 01:05:06.559 align:start position:0%
Northwoods law yes is it is it still
 
01:05:08.789 --> 01:05:08.799 align:start position:0%
airing so yeah well two things are
 
01:05:10.950 --> 01:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
happening so nor the big mistake Kevin
 
01:05:12.549 --> 01:05:12.559 align:start position:0%
Jordan made when we signed up for
 
01:05:14.069 --> 01:05:14.079 align:start position:0%
Northwoods laws I didn't do anything
 
01:05:16.870 --> 01:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
about the reruns I found out uh about
 
01:05:18.269 --> 01:05:18.279 align:start position:0%
television the money is made in the
 
01:05:20.990 --> 01:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
reruns not in the because it keeps going
 
01:05:22.470 --> 01:05:22.480 align:start position:0%
and we didn't we didn't do anything with
 
01:05:24.349 --> 01:05:24.359 align:start position:0%
that so we gave that to them free
 
01:05:26.309 --> 01:05:26.319 align:start position:0%
however the company has returned because
 
01:05:28.670 --> 01:05:28.680 align:start position:0%
the demands for the show have been great
 
01:05:31.950 --> 01:05:31.960 align:start position:0%
which is kind of interesting so they are
 
01:05:34.309 --> 01:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
we are in the middle of a contract
 
01:05:36.309 --> 01:05:36.319 align:start position:0%
negotiation uh but it looks like it's
 
01:05:38.670 --> 01:05:38.680 align:start position:0%
going to happen for us to return the
 
01:05:40.230 --> 01:05:40.240 align:start position:0%
only difference being we're going to be
 
01:05:43.069 --> 01:05:43.079 align:start position:0%
on YouTube which I'll never see but
 
01:05:45.510 --> 01:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to be on YouTube um and that
 
01:05:47.230 --> 01:05:47.240 align:start position:0%
is the new thing in television is
 
01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
YouTube so I'm looking forward to it
 
01:05:53.829 --> 01:05:53.839 align:start position:0%
because I have a a whole uh a whole
 
01:05:56.150 --> 01:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
number of new staff uh and they have
 
01:05:57.710 --> 01:05:57.720 align:start position:0%
come up and met some of the staff and
 
01:05:59.390 --> 01:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
they're excited about it and some of
 
01:06:01.349 --> 01:06:01.359 align:start position:0%
these kids want to do it and I I think
 
01:06:03.150 --> 01:06:03.160 align:start position:0%
it's a great opportunity I think it I
 
01:06:04.549 --> 01:06:04.559 align:start position:0%
think it does a couple of things for the
 
01:06:05.829 --> 01:06:05.839 align:start position:0%
state I think it promotes the state of
 
01:06:07.190 --> 01:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire certainly because it shows
 
01:06:09.349 --> 01:06:09.359 align:start position:0%
the natural resources and I also think
 
01:06:10.789 --> 01:06:10.799 align:start position:0%
it gives the officers a lot of the
 
01:06:12.390 --> 01:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
credit that they that all officers
 
01:06:14.190 --> 01:06:14.200 align:start position:0%
deserve for the great job they do and
 
01:06:15.950 --> 01:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
people don't realize it until you see it
 
01:06:19.430 --> 01:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
on a television show so um so yes it is
 
01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:20.630 align:start position:0%
on a television show so um so yes it is
coming

01:06:20.630 --> 01:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
coming
 
01:06:23.190 --> 01:06:23.200 align:start position:0%
back me
 
01:06:26.549 --> 01:06:26.559 align:start position:0%
too representative DeVito
 
01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
regarding the six openings that you have
 
01:06:29.549 --> 01:06:29.559 align:start position:0%
what do you think the difficulties are
 
01:06:31.990 --> 01:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
in finding those those candidates to you
 
01:06:34.510 --> 01:06:34.520 align:start position:0%
know it's getting hard and I I don't
 
01:06:36.710 --> 01:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
understand we we're all looking at it
 
01:06:38.549 --> 01:06:38.559 align:start position:0%
everybody's looking at it when we when
 
01:06:40.510 --> 01:06:40.520 align:start position:0%
we meet with any other agency the
 
01:06:42.150 --> 01:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
colonel of State Police I meet with
 
01:06:44.069 --> 01:06:44.079 align:start position:0%
regularly and we're all struggling with
 
01:06:45.910 --> 01:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
it we don't understand it I think some
 
01:06:48.470 --> 01:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
of it has to do with the kids today are
 
01:06:50.750 --> 01:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
smarter frankly I think they can make
 
01:06:52.349 --> 01:06:52.359 align:start position:0%
more money doing other things and
 
01:06:54.789 --> 01:06:54.799 align:start position:0%
they're looking at that I think another
 
01:06:57.589 --> 01:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
thing that has heard us is uh some we
 
01:06:59.349 --> 01:06:59.359 align:start position:0%
did to ourselves some of the hits that
 
01:07:01.430 --> 01:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
law enforcement has taken for mistakes
 
01:07:03.230 --> 01:07:03.240 align:start position:0%
they've made and some of the UN you know
 
01:07:05.750 --> 01:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
they they're viewed in some areas as not
 
01:07:07.670 --> 01:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
being very popular and I think these
 
01:07:11.269 --> 01:07:11.279 align:start position:0%
kids are a little intimidated by that um
 
01:07:13.589 --> 01:07:13.599 align:start position:0%
we offer great benefits we offer good
 
01:07:16.789 --> 01:07:16.799 align:start position:0%
salary um we're buying you know
 
01:07:19.549 --> 01:07:19.559 align:start position:0%
everything but but very few articles of
 
01:07:21.029 --> 01:07:21.039 align:start position:0%
clothing you're driving home with a
 
01:07:23.670 --> 01:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
cruiser there are huge benefits to it it
 
01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
does have demands when you ask someone
 
01:07:29.750 --> 01:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
to go above tree line at 60 below um you
 
01:07:31.829 --> 01:07:31.839 align:start position:0%
know not everybody wants to do that and
 
01:07:34.309 --> 01:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
so that that creates some issues but
 
01:07:35.829 --> 01:07:35.839 align:start position:0%
yeah we're we're all working on
 
01:07:38.150 --> 01:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
recruiting my major today is at three
 
01:07:40.670 --> 01:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
different schools high schools trying to
 
01:07:42.670 --> 01:07:42.680 align:start position:0%
encourage high school kids to take a
 
01:07:44.829 --> 01:07:44.839 align:start position:0%
look at this career so we're working
 
01:07:46.390 --> 01:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
pretty hard at it I don't I don't think
 
01:07:48.670 --> 01:07:48.680 align:start position:0%
anybody has the answer
 
01:07:53.190 --> 01:07:53.200 align:start position:0%
yet follow up your search dogs are those
 
01:07:57.109 --> 01:07:57.119 align:start position:0%
the plot hounds so we now we have Labs
 
01:07:59.630 --> 01:07:59.640 align:start position:0%
um I I love those dogs by the way that's
 
01:08:01.950 --> 01:08:01.960 align:start position:0%
my favorite part of the job they're all
 
01:08:05.549 --> 01:08:05.559 align:start position:0%
Labs I have every color lab um which is
 
01:08:07.789 --> 01:08:07.799 align:start position:0%
you know they're donated dogs I remember
 
01:08:09.589 --> 01:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
one of the kennel operators said listen
 
01:08:11.470 --> 01:08:11.480 align:start position:0%
I you know I got another dog for you but
 
01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
I really hate to tell you he's yellow
 
01:08:15.670 --> 01:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
he's a yellow lab I said listen the
 
01:08:16.950 --> 01:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
quality of these dogs I don't care if
 
01:08:18.910 --> 01:08:18.920 align:start position:0%
he's purple send him our way if you can
 
01:08:21.749 --> 01:08:21.759 align:start position:0%
do it so the LA labs are donated uh the
 
01:08:23.550 --> 01:08:23.560 align:start position:0%
officers put in a lot of time on their
 
01:08:25.149 --> 01:08:25.159 align:start position:0%
own and training and housing cuz that's
 
01:08:27.149 --> 01:08:27.159 align:start position:0%
a fulltime job seven days a week they
 
01:08:29.269 --> 01:08:29.279 align:start position:0%
take these dogs home I let them keep the
 
01:08:31.669 --> 01:08:31.679 align:start position:0%
dogs I fought hard to do that cuz I
 
01:08:33.950 --> 01:08:33.960 align:start position:0%
think they're their dogs um and they
 
01:08:37.189 --> 01:08:37.199 align:start position:0%
they build a bond that doesn't change
 
01:08:40.349 --> 01:08:40.359 align:start position:0%
like your dog um and so they are all
 
01:08:42.550 --> 01:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
Labs but they're trained in evidence
 
01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
detection they're trained in Wildlife
 
01:08:46.510 --> 01:08:46.520 align:start position:0%
detection so they can distinguish deer
 
01:08:48.669 --> 01:08:48.679 align:start position:0%
meat from regular meat U they can find
 
01:08:51.630 --> 01:08:51.640 align:start position:0%
moose meat they can find fish uh we are
 
01:08:53.829 --> 01:08:53.839 align:start position:0%
working I've been told or asked I've
 
01:08:56.309 --> 01:08:56.319 align:start position:0%
been asked by my team leader to write a
 
01:08:57.990 --> 01:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
memorandum of understanding they want to
 
01:08:59.910 --> 01:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
work with the medical examiner's office
 
01:09:01.870 --> 01:09:01.880 align:start position:0%
on cadavers they want to start working
 
01:09:05.149 --> 01:09:05.159 align:start position:0%
so we have a team ready to search for
 
01:09:09.430 --> 01:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
bodies um and and the unlike most other
 
01:09:11.510 --> 01:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
teams in the state they train weekly
 
01:09:13.990 --> 01:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
most places do it monthly my lieutenants
 
01:09:15.430 --> 01:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
complain about that because it takes
 
01:09:16.870 --> 01:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
these guys out of the field but I think
 
01:09:18.709 --> 01:09:18.719 align:start position:0%
that's what makes them better they train
 
01:09:20.349 --> 01:09:20.359 align:start position:0%
harder and they only train in those
 
01:09:21.749 --> 01:09:21.759 align:start position:0%
fields so they're going to be the best
 
01:09:24.070 --> 01:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
at it um what I like about them is I can
 
01:09:26.030 --> 01:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
bring them in here today would lap all
 
01:09:27.789 --> 01:09:27.799 align:start position:0%
of you to death they would jump up on
 
01:09:30.070 --> 01:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
you they're friendly dogs uh until you
 
01:09:31.550 --> 01:09:31.560 align:start position:0%
put that vest on and then they go to
 
01:09:33.789 --> 01:09:33.799 align:start position:0%
work but they're not the liability part
 
01:09:36.590 --> 01:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
of it doesn't exist uh for me so which
 
01:09:38.149 --> 01:09:38.159 align:start position:0%
is good I don't have to worry about him
 
01:09:40.590 --> 01:09:40.600 align:start position:0%
biting uh or doing anything the kids
 
01:09:42.669 --> 01:09:42.679 align:start position:0%
love them and uh they're great to work
 
01:09:46.510 --> 01:09:46.520 align:start position:0%
with we enjoy them we just recently lost
 
01:09:49.470 --> 01:09:49.480 align:start position:0%
one I lost Ruger uh which tore my heart
 
01:09:51.709 --> 01:09:51.719 align:start position:0%
out we had him for 12 years I think it
 
01:09:53.309 --> 01:09:53.319 align:start position:0%
was 12 years Ruger was one of the
 
01:09:55.030 --> 01:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
beginning dogs he was one of my favorite
 
01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:56.310 align:start position:0%
beginning dogs he was one of my favorite
dogs

01:09:56.310 --> 01:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
dogs
 
01:09:58.950 --> 01:09:58.960 align:start position:0%
um and he just passed away at the age of
 
01:10:01.390 --> 01:10:01.400 align:start position:0%
12 so we're going to honor him soon
 
01:10:04.229 --> 01:10:04.239 align:start position:0%
you'll see that I'm sure
 
01:10:07.110 --> 01:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
so thank you any other questions
 
01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:08.149 align:start position:0%
so thank you any other questions
representative

01:10:08.149 --> 01:10:08.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:10:10.110 --> 01:10:10.120 align:start position:0%
oulette thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:10:12.990 --> 01:10:13.000 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question yes sir um I
 
01:10:14.550 --> 01:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
was uh involved with some general
 
01:10:15.550 --> 01:10:15.560 align:start position:0%
contractors at the State of New
 
01:10:17.790 --> 01:10:17.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and they instituted an intern
 
01:10:19.870 --> 01:10:19.880 align:start position:0%
program for high school and college kids
 
01:10:22.030 --> 01:10:22.040 align:start position:0%
and they found that the retention after
 
01:10:23.990 --> 01:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
these kids get out of college was very
 
01:10:26.910 --> 01:10:26.920 align:start position:0%
high once they found found a home before
 
01:10:28.550 --> 01:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
or while they were in college have you
 
01:10:29.990 --> 01:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
ever instituted something like that
 
01:10:32.310 --> 01:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
we've been doing it actually sir so the
 
01:10:33.910 --> 01:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
problem with an internship is that it's
 
01:10:36.310 --> 01:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
a huge commitment of ours I just did it
 
01:10:38.229 --> 01:10:38.239 align:start position:0%
for personally I did it because I didn't
 
01:10:39.830 --> 01:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
want to ask a field officer to do it for
 
01:10:42.350 --> 01:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
a student uh out of Plymouth State and
 
01:10:44.669 --> 01:10:44.679 align:start position:0%
she is working as a dispatcher at marrat
 
01:10:46.790 --> 01:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
County she'll probably spend her career
 
01:10:49.229 --> 01:10:49.239 align:start position:0%
there so there is value in it I I would
 
01:10:50.550 --> 01:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
agree I've got another one that I'm
 
01:10:52.270 --> 01:10:52.280 align:start position:0%
reaching out to that is interested in
 
01:10:54.790 --> 01:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
doing it um we do a lot of ridealong
 
01:10:58.510 --> 01:10:58.520 align:start position:0%
programs a lot of um you know reduced
 
01:11:01.350 --> 01:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
not a full internship but reduced hours
 
01:11:04.189 --> 01:11:04.199 align:start position:0%
um D and our HR department has developed
 
01:11:06.110 --> 01:11:06.120 align:start position:0%
a whole program so when we take on an
 
01:11:08.950 --> 01:11:08.960 align:start position:0%
intern she has a whole package for me
 
01:11:10.350 --> 01:11:10.360 align:start position:0%
that we fill out and do so we are
 
01:11:12.110 --> 01:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
looking at doing that I think I agree
 
01:11:13.669 --> 01:11:13.679 align:start position:0%
with you I think that has had some
 
01:11:15.390 --> 01:11:15.400 align:start position:0%
success and we're trying to do that
 
01:11:17.470 --> 01:11:17.480 align:start position:0%
problem is when you have limited staff
 
01:11:19.910 --> 01:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
it's hard to you know because I can't
 
01:11:21.830 --> 01:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
take them above tree lines so if we send
 
01:11:23.870 --> 01:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
one of these officers on a mission you
 
01:11:26.110 --> 01:11:26.120 align:start position:0%
have to think about that um how we're
 
01:11:27.669 --> 01:11:27.679 align:start position:0%
doing that but we are starting to do
 
01:11:29.030 --> 01:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
that I agree with you I think it's a
 
01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:30.950 align:start position:0%
that I agree with you I think it's a
great

01:11:30.950 --> 01:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
great
 
01:11:33.149 --> 01:11:33.159 align:start position:0%
tool okay
 
01:11:36.350 --> 01:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
followup thank you uh could you just
 
01:11:38.950 --> 01:11:38.960 align:start position:0%
take a minute and and speak to us on the
 
01:11:40.910 --> 01:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
success and challenges of your hike Safe
 
01:11:44.870 --> 01:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
program yes so I I would like to thank
 
01:11:46.629 --> 01:11:46.639 align:start position:0%
this committee for hike safe I came here
 
01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
for the new members I came here for 20
 
01:11:50.830 --> 01:11:50.840 align:start position:0%
years complaining that we weren't funded
 
01:11:52.870 --> 01:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
enough for search and rescue and and we
 
01:11:54.390 --> 01:11:54.400 align:start position:0%
can always use more money for that those
 
01:11:56.350 --> 01:11:56.360 align:start position:0%
missions are a very Prett expensive they
 
01:11:57.990 --> 01:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
involve a lot of overtime they involve a
 
01:12:00.030 --> 01:12:00.040 align:start position:0%
lot of resources uh some of those
 
01:12:02.430 --> 01:12:02.440 align:start position:0%
missions can run anywhere they can run
 
01:12:05.470 --> 01:12:05.480 align:start position:0%
the range from $500 to $50,000 depending
 
01:12:07.110 --> 01:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
on how long we're in it and what we're
 
01:12:10.790 --> 01:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
doing um and so my repeated attempts at
 
01:12:12.510 --> 01:12:12.520 align:start position:0%
coming to the legislature asking for
 
01:12:15.709 --> 01:12:15.719 align:start position:0%
funding resulted in a the idea of a hike
 
01:12:17.870 --> 01:12:17.880 align:start position:0%
safe card we have a excuse me a hike
 
01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
Safe program which was kind of an
 
01:12:21.149 --> 01:12:21.159 align:start position:0%
educational program telling people what
 
01:12:24.629 --> 01:12:24.639 align:start position:0%
to put in their packs how to hike safely
 
01:12:27.070 --> 01:12:27.080 align:start position:0%
we I kind of fought to name this card
 
01:12:29.350 --> 01:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
after that program for Branding purposes
 
01:12:31.110 --> 01:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
to keep it all in one program so they
 
01:12:32.750 --> 01:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
could buy a card and and read the
 
01:12:35.750 --> 01:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
educational piece at the same time uh
 
01:12:37.350 --> 01:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
this committee was instrumental in
 
01:12:39.430 --> 01:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
helping me get that set up the hike safe
 
01:12:41.350 --> 01:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
card so we sell a card for you're going
 
01:12:42.910 --> 01:12:42.920 align:start position:0%
to hear a little testimony later this
 
01:12:44.990 --> 01:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
morning or today on on this card we're
 
01:12:47.110 --> 01:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
going to make a little change in it um
 
01:12:48.870 --> 01:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
but we sell a card for
 
01:12:52.709 --> 01:12:52.719 align:start position:0%
$25 uh person and I think it's 35 for a
 
01:12:55.950 --> 01:12:55.960 align:start position:0%
family um and the idea of this was that
 
01:12:58.189 --> 01:12:58.199 align:start position:0%
47% of our search and rescue missions
 
01:12:59.870 --> 01:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
were for hikers and climbers and they
 
01:13:02.030 --> 01:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
were not paying into the system our
 
01:13:03.790 --> 01:13:03.800 align:start position:0%
fishermen and our Hunters were paying
 
01:13:06.110 --> 01:13:06.120 align:start position:0%
the bill and so I didn't feel that that
 
01:13:08.669 --> 01:13:08.679 align:start position:0%
was fair now now with and this is a
 
01:13:10.590 --> 01:13:10.600 align:start position:0%
voluntary thing people don't have to do
 
01:13:13.030 --> 01:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
it but they they can and it makes them
 
01:13:14.350 --> 01:13:14.360 align:start position:0%
part of the system they're now
 
01:13:16.110 --> 01:13:16.120 align:start position:0%
contributing to the cost of this this
 
01:13:17.510 --> 01:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
has amounted to
 
01:13:20.790 --> 01:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
$300,000 this past year infused into my
 
01:13:22.550 --> 01:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
search and rescue budget which was a big
 
01:13:25.430 --> 01:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
bonus so uh the two young ladies that we
 
01:13:27.430 --> 01:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
saved Sunday night on Mount Washington
 
01:13:29.590 --> 01:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
at 60 below that were caught up there in
 
01:13:31.709 --> 01:13:31.719 align:start position:0%
chest deep snow the first words out of

01:14:46.669 --> 01:14:46.679 align:start position:0%
will tell you with great confidence we
 
01:14:49.590 --> 01:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
are the best equipped the best trained
 
01:14:51.790 --> 01:14:51.800 align:start position:0%
and the best paid frankly that we've
 
01:14:53.910 --> 01:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
ever been so we've made some great
 
01:14:55.709 --> 01:14:55.719 align:start position:0%
strides and and and it's been through
 
01:14:57.470 --> 01:14:57.480 align:start position:0%
the help of the legislature for that we
 
01:15:00.470 --> 01:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
can use more people we're I'm breaking
 
01:15:03.229 --> 01:15:03.239 align:start position:0%
up people hiking uh I've got I've lost
 
01:15:05.070 --> 01:15:05.080 align:start position:0%
two officers to disabilities from
 
01:15:07.430 --> 01:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
multiple injuries you continually send a
 
01:15:10.430 --> 01:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
guy up Falling Waters Trail and and
 
01:15:12.390 --> 01:15:12.400 align:start position:0%
eventually his knees are going to go or
 
01:15:14.270 --> 01:15:14.280 align:start position:0%
in my case I did it for many years both
 
01:15:15.830 --> 01:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
my shoulders went i' had to have him
 
01:15:17.830 --> 01:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
have him rebuilt you know you can't you
 
01:15:19.470 --> 01:15:19.480 align:start position:0%
can only do that so long and the more
 
01:15:20.910 --> 01:15:20.920 align:start position:0%
people that you have the more you can
 
01:15:23.629 --> 01:15:23.639 align:start position:0%
spread out that wealth um and you may
 
01:15:26.470 --> 01:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
not injure the same people repeatedly so
 
01:15:28.870 --> 01:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
um so that would be a big help as more
 
01:15:31.510 --> 01:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
people but we are very well paid we are
 
01:15:33.629 --> 01:15:33.639 align:start position:0%
very well equipped I think we fight hard
 
01:15:35.830 --> 01:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
for that um but we can always use
 
01:15:38.110 --> 01:15:38.120 align:start position:0%
everybody behind me could use more staff
 
01:15:39.830 --> 01:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
that's for sure there's only I think
 
01:15:42.750 --> 01:15:42.760 align:start position:0%
there's like 250 people over there doing
 
01:15:45.950 --> 01:15:45.960 align:start position:0%
amazing amazing work Statewide and we
 
01:15:48.310 --> 01:15:48.320 align:start position:0%

01:21:13.790 --> 01:21:13.800 align:start position:0%
Association
 
01:21:16.470 --> 01:21:16.480 align:start position:0%
National I was on their legislative
 
01:21:18.229 --> 01:21:18.239 align:start position:0%
committee down in
 
01:21:20.870 --> 01:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
Washington and worked with a lot of
 
01:21:23.830 --> 01:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
legislation on conserving water
 
01:21:25.990 --> 01:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
conserving soil
 
01:21:29.149 --> 01:21:29.159 align:start position:0%
conditions and I can probably say I was
 
01:21:32.750 --> 01:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:36.270 --> 01:21:36.280 align:start position:0%
that dealing with Washington when you go
 
01:21:39.310 --> 01:21:39.320 align:start position:0%
in and you have for an example you buy a
 
01:21:43.149 --> 01:21:43.159 align:start position:0%
refrigerator today and it's energy
 
01:21:45.590 --> 01:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
certified I was able to get three
 
01:21:47.590 --> 01:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
different irrigation controllers under
 
01:21:51.189 --> 01:21:51.199 align:start position:0%
that program that are energy certified
 
01:21:55.229 --> 01:21:55.239 align:start position:0%
on conserving water so basically in my
 
01:21:59.350 --> 01:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
whole lifetime I have been involved with
 
01:22:02.950 --> 01:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
legislation and hard work the reason why
 
01:22:05.030 --> 01:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
I became a commissioner
 
01:22:07.950 --> 01:22:07.960 align:start position:0%
is I have three
 
01:22:10.669 --> 01:22:10.679 align:start position:0%
daughters I also have four
 
01:22:13.430 --> 01:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
granddaughters I'm outnumbered at my
 
01:22:18.830 --> 01:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
house I have one son my thing is that I
 
01:22:22.590 --> 01:22:22.600 align:start position:0%
grew up doing a little bit of hunting my
 
01:22:26.310 --> 01:22:26.320 align:start position:0%
major fishing was saltwater fishing out
 
01:22:29.709 --> 01:22:29.719 align:start position:0%
on the Sea Coast when my grandchildren
 
01:22:32.470 --> 01:22:32.480 align:start position:0%
started to get big enough I started to
 
01:22:36.310 --> 01:22:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:39.350 --> 01:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
fishing my thing was that we need to
 
01:22:42.229 --> 01:22:42.239 align:start position:0%
keep a future for the future
 
01:22:44.669 --> 01:22:44.679 align:start position:0%
generations and that's why I got
 
01:22:48.910 --> 01:22:48.920 align:start position:0%
involved with being a fishing game
 
01:22:50.870 --> 01:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner and I'm open to any
 
01:22:53.350 --> 01:22:53.360 align:start position:0%
questions thank you any questions for
 
01:22:56.990 --> 01:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.910 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:22:59.910 --> 01:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:03.070 --> 01:23:03.080 align:start position:0%
Harvey so I hear you tell me that you
 
01:23:05.310 --> 01:23:05.320 align:start position:0%
know and I think you're paraphrase
 
01:23:07.830 --> 01:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
paraphrasing which is okay that the
 
01:23:09.750 --> 01:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
purposes of the fishing Game Commission
 
01:23:12.709 --> 01:23:12.719 align:start position:0%
is a management of Wildlife and to act
 
01:23:15.990 --> 01:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
as a representative of the public um but
 
01:23:19.149 --> 01:23:19.159 align:start position:0%
your mission is also stated in statute
 
01:23:22.669 --> 01:23:22.679 align:start position:0%
as well correct yes it is
 
01:23:25.270 --> 01:23:25.280 align:start position:0%
followup followup
 
01:23:26.629 --> 01:23:26.639 align:start position:0%
um I was looking it up and I couldn't
 
01:23:29.070 --> 01:23:29.080 align:start position:0%
find it fast enough can you uh tell me
 
01:23:31.310 --> 01:23:31.320 align:start position:0%
what this uh
 
01:23:33.310 --> 01:23:33.320 align:start position:0%
statute um what the mission of the
 
01:23:38.950 --> 01:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
you are you saying under statute what
 
01:23:44.550 --> 01:23:44.560 align:start position:0%
are the duties of the commission we are
 
01:23:46.470 --> 01:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
there to manage the
 
01:23:49.910 --> 01:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
wildlife and uh we also there as like a
 
01:23:52.550 --> 01:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
legaz on to the public I cannot sit here
 
01:23:55.629 --> 01:23:55.639 align:start position:0%
and recite the whole statute of ra L let
 
01:23:58.390 --> 01:23:58.400 align:start position:0%
me um it also has let me redirect this
 
01:24:00.189 --> 01:24:00.199 align:start position:0%
Brad can you pull up the statute
 
01:24:02.070 --> 01:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
definition for Fishing Game Commission
 
01:24:04.470 --> 01:24:04.480 align:start position:0%
so that the committee can hear what it
 
01:24:12.390 --> 01:24:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:15.030 --> 01:24:15.040 align:start position:0%
quicker be under that or no it's not
 
01:24:24.669 --> 01:24:24.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:25.590 --> 01:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
this should be something that says
 
01:24:30.350 --> 01:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:34.110 --> 01:24:34.120 align:start position:0%
commission it was in the beginning 2062
 
01:24:36.110 --> 01:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
I believe it
 
01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:38.510 align:start position:0%
I believe it
was

01:24:38.510 --> 01:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:24:42.270 --> 01:24:42.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:42.280 --> 01:24:45.350 align:start position:0%
 
number

01:24:45.350 --> 01:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:47.550 --> 01:24:47.560 align:start position:0%
yeah action you're getting that there
 
01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:50.790 align:start position:0%
yeah action you're getting that there
you

01:24:50.790 --> 01:24:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:55.470 --> 01:24:55.480 align:start position:0%
go under the statute of 2062
 
01:24:58.870 --> 01:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
the commission shall consist of 11
 
01:25:05.270 --> 01:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:07.950 --> 01:25:07.960 align:start position:0%
262a we're appointed by the governor and
 
01:25:09.350 --> 01:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
the executive
 
01:25:12.070 --> 01:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
councel and the way that is done is that
 
01:25:14.990 --> 01:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
we get Nom you know we'll get
 
01:25:18.430 --> 01:25:18.440 align:start position:0%
nominated from the governor to the
 
01:25:22.270 --> 01:25:22.280 align:start position:0%
executive councel once the nomination is
 
01:25:26.070 --> 01:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
made to the executive Council
 
01:25:29.149 --> 01:25:29.159 align:start position:0%
um the nomination is held for 30 days
 
01:25:31.030 --> 01:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
for anybody from the public that wants
 
01:25:34.790 --> 01:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
to put input into it and after 30 days
 
01:25:38.830 --> 01:25:38.840 align:start position:0%
the executive Council will then vote on
 
01:25:42.109 --> 01:25:42.119 align:start position:0%
whether or not we become a
 
01:25:44.709 --> 01:25:44.719 align:start position:0%
commissioner and you know as with
 
01:25:47.790 --> 01:25:47.800 align:start position:0%
executive counsel obviously it's you
 
01:25:51.550 --> 01:25:51.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:58.669 --> 01:25:58.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:02.189 --> 01:26:02.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:04.629 --> 01:26:04.639 align:start position:0%
organization sometimes it points to the
 
01:26:08.189 --> 01:26:08.199 align:start position:0%
sporting clubs in each C County May from
 
01:26:10.590 --> 01:26:10.600 align:start position:0%
a county sporting club board whenever an
 
01:26:13.030 --> 01:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
appointment is to be made to the
 
01:26:15.790 --> 01:26:15.800 align:start position:0%
commission each board May nominate one
 
01:26:17.910 --> 01:26:17.920 align:start position:0%
to three persons submitted for such
 
01:26:20.229 --> 01:26:20.239 align:start position:0%
recommendation of the
 
01:26:23.270 --> 01:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
governor um then when you get down into
 
01:26:27.189 --> 01:26:27.199 align:start position:0%
further and like I said this is rather
 
01:26:30.109 --> 01:26:30.119 align:start position:0%
lengthy so I'll I'll get down to I think
 
01:26:32.790 --> 01:26:32.800 align:start position:0%
what I'm ask asking what you're looking
 
01:26:37.470 --> 01:26:37.480 align:start position:0%
for representative harv is um the
 
01:26:39.310 --> 01:26:39.320 align:start position:0%
qualifications is that
 
01:26:41.350 --> 01:26:41.360 align:start position:0%
correct I'm sorry maybe I'm not being
 
01:26:44.390 --> 01:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
clear um I don't need you to read 2062
 
01:26:46.910 --> 01:26:46.920 align:start position:0%
because I can look it up as well thank
 
01:26:49.390 --> 01:26:49.400 align:start position:0%
you um so maybe I didn't State my
 
01:26:51.229 --> 01:26:51.239 align:start position:0%
question correctly can I try restating
 
01:26:55.430 --> 01:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
it absolutely thank you so um
 
01:26:56.709 --> 01:26:56.719 align:start position:0%
you know I've read that passage a
 
01:27:00.030 --> 01:27:00.040 align:start position:0%
million times but maybe I'm asking um
 
01:27:02.709 --> 01:27:02.719 align:start position:0%
because you are the New Hampshire
 
01:27:04.510 --> 01:27:04.520 align:start position:0%
fishing Game
 
01:27:07.790 --> 01:27:07.800 align:start position:0%
Commission there is um there is a
 
01:27:09.870 --> 01:27:09.880 align:start position:0%
mission statement for New Hampshire
 
01:27:13.470 --> 01:27:13.480 align:start position:0%
fishing game and I don't have it at the
 
01:27:14.790 --> 01:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
tip of my tongue but it's something
 
01:27:16.310 --> 01:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
about bringing the
 
01:27:20.070 --> 01:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
outdoors to to everyone and that that's
 
01:27:21.950 --> 01:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
that's the one I I think I'm asking for
 
01:27:23.750 --> 01:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
what what is the overall mission
 
01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:24.750 align:start position:0%
what what is the overall mission
statement

01:27:24.750 --> 01:27:24.760 align:start position:0%
statement
 
01:27:27.229 --> 01:27:27.239 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire fishing
 
01:27:29.830 --> 01:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
game I don't know the exact overall
 
01:27:31.870 --> 01:27:31.880 align:start position:0%
mission statement for the fishing game
 
01:27:35.669 --> 01:27:35.679 align:start position:0%
department because technically we
 
01:27:38.390 --> 01:27:38.400 align:start position:0%
are we are separate from the Hampshire
 
01:27:40.910 --> 01:27:40.920 align:start position:0%
fishing game department we have a
 
01:27:43.310 --> 01:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
fishing game
 
01:27:46.990 --> 01:27:47.000 align:start position:0%
commission and we are also part of I
 
01:27:49.990 --> 01:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
believe it's three
 
01:27:52.550 --> 01:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
regulatory commissions in the state of
 
01:27:55.790 --> 01:27:55.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we want of three we have
 
01:27:58.189 --> 01:27:58.199 align:start position:0%
the fishing Game Commission the New
 
01:27:59.870 --> 01:27:59.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Lottery Commission and the
 
01:28:02.709 --> 01:28:02.719 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission that were
 
01:28:02.719 --> 01:28:04.350 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission that were
under

01:28:04.350 --> 01:28:04.360 align:start position:0%
under
 
01:28:08.270 --> 01:28:08.280 align:start position:0%
regulatory we are not and and and this
 
01:28:11.550 --> 01:28:11.560 align:start position:0%
is the easiest way to explain it we are
 
01:28:16.550 --> 01:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
not a part of New Hampshire fishing game
 
01:28:20.109 --> 01:28:20.119 align:start position:0%
in fact in statute it says the Fish and
 
01:28:20.119 --> 01:28:21.709 align:start position:0%
in fact in statute it says the Fish and
Game

01:28:21.709 --> 01:28:21.719 align:start position:0%
Game
 
01:28:24.350 --> 01:28:24.360 align:start position:0%
Commission um also looks at the the
 
01:28:27.310 --> 01:28:27.320 align:start position:0%
overall operation of fishing game if you
 
01:28:29.830 --> 01:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
go back on the history of New Hampshire
 
01:28:33.070 --> 01:28:33.080 align:start position:0%
fishing game and the fishing Game
 
01:28:35.510 --> 01:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
Commission try not to quote me on this
 
01:28:37.709 --> 01:28:37.719 align:start position:0%
one but I believe was back in the
 
01:28:41.629 --> 01:28:41.639 align:start position:0%
1800s it was a fishing game commission
 
01:28:42.669 --> 01:28:42.679 align:start position:0%
that it
 
01:28:44.910 --> 01:28:44.920 align:start position:0%
started and when the fishing Game
 
01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:46.030 align:start position:0%
started and when the fishing Game
Commission

01:28:46.030 --> 01:28:46.040 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
01:28:49.430 --> 01:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
started it was also each Town had to
 
01:28:52.189 --> 01:28:52.199 align:start position:0%
have a fishing game commissioner for
 
01:28:54.390 --> 01:28:54.400 align:start position:0%
each town so I imagine somewhere along
 
01:28:57.109 --> 01:28:57.119 align:start position:0%
the line you take the amount of towns
 
01:28:59.550 --> 01:28:59.560 align:start position:0%
and cities in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:29:02.790 --> 01:29:02.800 align:start position:0%
let narrow this down and it became the
 
01:29:04.870 --> 01:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
fishing Game
 
01:29:07.310 --> 01:29:07.320 align:start position:0%
Commission and then years down the road
 
01:29:10.109 --> 01:29:10.119 align:start position:0%
from that it became the fishing game
 
01:29:13.750 --> 01:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
department Under The Fishing Game
 
01:29:16.030 --> 01:29:16.040 align:start position:0%
Commission and that's actually the way
 
01:29:18.550 --> 01:29:18.560 align:start position:0%
it still reads
 
01:29:22.149 --> 01:29:22.159 align:start position:0%
today thank you followup um it's not a
 
01:29:25.149 --> 01:29:25.159 align:start position:0%
question um members of the committee
 
01:29:26.910 --> 01:29:26.920 align:start position:0%
pointed it out to me it's it's actually

selectman
 
01:31:13.550 --> 01:31:13.560 align:start position:0%
uh I don't know where I was going with
 
01:31:16.830 --> 01:31:16.840 align:start position:0%
that but anyway I have been on the on
 
01:31:20.270 --> 01:31:20.280 align:start position:0%
the commission now about eight years uh
 
01:31:23.030 --> 01:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner hodon who was in the corner
 
01:31:24.990 --> 01:31:25.000 align:start position:0%
right there him and I came on the same
 
01:31:27.910 --> 01:31:27.920 align:start position:0%
day we're the oldest setting setting
 
01:31:30.750 --> 01:31:30.760 align:start position:0%
members of the commission
 
01:31:34.510 --> 01:31:34.520 align:start position:0%
uh uh I I've been two years as chair of
 
01:31:37.590 --> 01:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
the commission took a break commissioner
 
01:31:41.750 --> 01:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
green took over then he he got sick of
 
01:31:44.350 --> 01:31:44.360 align:start position:0%
that and then they got me back in the
 
01:31:47.189 --> 01:31:47.199 align:start position:0%
next year and then I got sick of that
 
01:31:50.669 --> 01:31:50.679 align:start position:0%
and now he's back in as chair so it's
 
01:31:53.990 --> 01:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's a it's a situation that that
 
01:31:56.830 --> 01:31:56.840 align:start position:0%
that can evolve into many different
 
01:32:00.590 --> 01:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
things we govern our own we had recently
 
01:32:03.750 --> 01:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
a commissioner that that
 
01:32:07.189 --> 01:32:07.199 align:start position:0%
violated uh their oath and we had to
 
01:32:08.750 --> 01:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
have a hearing with the Attorney
 
01:32:11.669 --> 01:32:11.679 align:start position:0%
General's office and we recommended the
 
01:32:14.830 --> 01:32:14.840 align:start position:0%
removal of that that commissioner and
 
01:32:17.790 --> 01:32:17.800 align:start position:0%
that commissioner resigned before could
 
01:32:19.510 --> 01:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
officially be removed by the government
 
01:32:22.629 --> 01:32:22.639 align:start position:0%
Council so we do monitor our own it's
 
01:32:26.229 --> 01:32:26.239 align:start position:0%
again not not a good thing to do but uh
 
01:32:29.149 --> 01:32:29.159 align:start position:0%
it it's a right thing to do um I was
 
01:32:31.109 --> 01:32:31.119 align:start position:0%
born and brought up in Pittsburgh
 
01:32:33.870 --> 01:32:33.880 align:start position:0%

the uh The Fish and Game Commission
 
01:33:58.990 --> 01:33:59.000 align:start position:0%
April of
 
01:34:02.910 --> 01:34:02.920 align:start position:0%
2023 my um main expertise comes in with
 
01:34:06.270 --> 01:34:06.280 align:start position:0%
the Marine Resources I have heavily
 
01:34:09.109 --> 01:34:09.119 align:start position:0%
involved in commercial fishing I
 
01:34:11.990 --> 01:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
obtained my first uh State Lobster
 
01:34:13.390 --> 01:34:13.400 align:start position:0%
license in
 
01:34:16.750 --> 01:34:16.760 align:start position:0%
1965 and I also have a federal offshore
 
01:34:19.109 --> 01:34:19.119 align:start position:0%
Lobster permit and I also have Federal
 
01:34:21.830 --> 01:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
permits for for groundfish I've been
 
01:34:23.350 --> 01:34:23.360 align:start position:0%
involved in lobster fishing I've been
 
01:34:25.910 --> 01:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
involved in Gil netting longlining I've
 
01:34:28.709 --> 01:34:28.719 align:start position:0%
crewed on um draggers so that's
 
01:34:31.990 --> 01:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
basically the thrust of my uh expertise
 
01:34:36.109 --> 01:34:36.119 align:start position:0%
um for um the SE commissioner um the
 
01:34:39.310 --> 01:34:39.320 align:start position:0%
petition came up um and I had a
 
01:34:41.709 --> 01:34:41.719 align:start position:0%
conversation with the former director
 
01:34:45.629 --> 01:34:45.639 align:start position:0%
Scott Mason and he thought um talked to
 
01:34:48.229 --> 01:34:48.239 align:start position:0%
me and asked if uh it'd be worthwhile
 
01:34:51.070 --> 01:34:51.080 align:start position:0%
having a commercial fisherman on the uh
 
01:34:53.149 --> 01:34:53.159 align:start position:0%
on the commission there were a lot of
 
01:34:55.189 --> 01:34:55.199 align:start position:0%
challenges within the industry a lot of
 
01:34:57.229 --> 01:34:57.239 align:start position:0%
regulations we're one of the commercial
 
01:34:59.310 --> 01:34:59.320 align:start position:0%
fishing industry is one of the most
 
01:35:01.870 --> 01:35:01.880 align:start position:0%
regulated Industries in this country and
 
01:35:04.070 --> 01:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
with all the challenges and sustain
 
01:35:07.430 --> 01:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
sustainability issues um in my
 
01:35:08.870 --> 01:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
conversations with other fishermen they
 
01:35:10.669 --> 01:35:10.679 align:start position:0%
thought it might be a good idea to have
 
01:35:12.669 --> 01:35:12.679 align:start position:0%
some kind of representation within the
 
01:35:16.669 --> 01:35:16.679 align:start position:0%
commission uh on on um this this um
 
01:35:20.310 --> 01:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
Endeavor uh so that's when I became
 
01:35:22.430 --> 01:35:22.440 align:start position:0%
that's when I became the commissioner
 
01:35:24.470 --> 01:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
01:35:27.550 --> 01:35:27.560 align:start position:0%
I do get a lot of calls from
 
01:35:29.229 --> 01:35:29.239 align:start position:0%
constituents about different questions
 
01:35:32.870 --> 01:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
about clamming about um fresh saltwater
 
01:35:36.030 --> 01:35:36.040 align:start position:0%
fishing licenses size limits things of
 
01:35:38.189 --> 01:35:38.199 align:start position:0%
that nature from Recreation from
 
01:35:42.229 --> 01:35:42.239 align:start position:0%
recreational industry as well so
 
01:35:46.030 --> 01:35:46.040 align:start position:0%
basically that's that's my story thank
 
01:35:48.709 --> 01:35:48.719 align:start position:0%
you any
 
01:35:50.669 --> 01:35:50.679 align:start position:0%
questions representative Khan you must
 
01:35:52.149 --> 01:35:52.159 align:start position:0%
have a question he's your representative
 
01:35:54.470 --> 01:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
on the
 
01:35:57.629 --> 01:35:57.639 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I appreciate it uh
 
01:36:00.629 --> 01:36:00.639 align:start position:0%
Mr ton if you please tell the committee
 
01:36:02.870 --> 01:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
members you testified a couple of days
 
01:36:04.550 --> 01:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
ago in another bill I don't want to
 
01:36:07.709 --> 01:36:07.719 align:start position:0%
bring that bill but how big is the Gulf
 
01:36:10.390 --> 01:36:10.400 align:start position:0%
of Maine compared to the whole ocean and
 
01:36:13.750 --> 01:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
how much fishing the fisherman does in
 
01:36:17.510 --> 01:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
Gulf of ocean to fulfill our demand the
 
01:36:21.590 --> 01:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
Gulf of Maine uh represents just 10 10%
 
01:36:23.830 --> 01:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
of the entire Atlantic seaboard but yet
 
01:36:25.830 --> 01:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
the Gulf of Maine are responsible for
 
01:36:28.189 --> 01:36:28.199 align:start position:0%
50% of all the seafood that's landed on
 
01:36:31.950 --> 01:36:31.960 align:start position:0%
the Eastern Seaboard um there's close to
 
01:36:34.270 --> 01:36:34.280 align:start position:0%
over a billion dollars worth of seafood
 
01:36:37.030 --> 01:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
product that gets landed and if you put
 
01:36:39.830 --> 01:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
the multiplier on that between the other
 
01:36:41.590 --> 01:36:41.600 align:start position:0%
peripheral industries that involved
 
01:36:43.590 --> 01:36:43.600 align:start position:0%
after the fish is landed that's going to
 
01:36:46.070 --> 01:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
be in excess of $3 billion dollar of
 
01:36:49.149 --> 01:36:49.159 align:start position:0%
economic U Prosperity that derived from
 
01:36:52.870 --> 01:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
the commercial fishing industry so it's
 
01:36:55.510 --> 01:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
it's pretty uh economically uh important
 
01:36:58.830 --> 01:36:58.840 align:start position:0%
uh aspect of the uh of this entire
 
01:37:00.550 --> 01:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
region thank
 
01:37:03.910 --> 01:37:03.920 align:start position:0%

well-paying job um and when I retired

01:53:22.109 --> 01:53:22.119 align:start position:0%
grandchildren and I'd really like to
 
01:53:24.350 --> 01:53:24.360 align:start position:0%
maintain this so that they they enjoy
 
01:53:27.109 --> 01:53:27.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:29.950 --> 01:53:29.960 align:start position:0%
Sports thank you are there any
 
01:53:32.430 --> 01:53:32.440 align:start position:0%
questions seeing
 
01:53:35.790 --> 01:53:35.800 align:start position:0%
none do we have any more Commissioners
 
01:53:37.229 --> 01:53:37.239 align:start position:0%
Ray green would you like to make one
 
01:53:40.990 --> 01:53:41.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:43.750 --> 01:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
yes I just wanted to answer two
 
01:53:46.270 --> 01:53:46.280 align:start position:0%
questions that came up uh Mr chairman
 
01:53:47.629 --> 01:53:47.639 align:start position:0%
one was
 
01:53:51.030 --> 01:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
on um I present of your question on if
 
01:53:53.629 --> 01:53:53.639 align:start position:0%
we get paid more than a St State Rep we
 
01:53:56.669 --> 01:53:56.679 align:start position:0%
do not we do not the
 
01:53:59.109 --> 01:53:59.119 align:start position:0%
only the only thing we're paid for is
 
01:54:02.270 --> 01:54:02.280 align:start position:0%
our mileage we don't get plates we don't
 
01:54:04.750 --> 01:54:04.760 align:start position:0%
get vehicle reg
 
01:54:07.189 --> 01:54:07.199 align:start position:0%
registration um the commissioner that's
 
01:54:09.189 --> 01:54:09.199 align:start position:0%
wearing a commission shirt he has to pay
 
01:54:10.149 --> 01:54:10.159 align:start position:0%
for that
 
01:54:13.270 --> 01:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
himself we we don't all we get is
 
01:54:16.390 --> 01:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
mileage the other question was yours Mr
 
01:54:19.870 --> 01:54:19.880 align:start position:0%
chairman on the public hearings we are
 
01:54:23.310 --> 01:54:23.320 align:start position:0%
also as Commissioners required by law to
 
01:54:25.910 --> 01:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
attend those hearings you know when they
 
01:54:29.550 --> 01:54:29.560 align:start position:0%
have the um hearings to the public on
 
01:54:32.470 --> 01:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
rule making that is done by fish and
 
01:54:34.430 --> 01:54:34.440 align:start position:0%
game but we as Commissioners are
 
01:54:38.390 --> 01:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
required to be there so we're also
 
01:54:42.109 --> 01:54:42.119 align:start position:0%
hearing what the public is asking and I
 
01:54:44.629 --> 01:54:44.639 align:start position:0%
just wanted to clear those up sir thank
 
01:54:46.589 --> 01:54:46.599 align:start position:0%
you so much it is an important part of
 
01:54:48.589 --> 01:54:48.599 align:start position:0%
what we have to deal with when we talk
 
01:54:52.470 --> 01:54:52.480 align:start position:0%
about the rules and such yeah
 
01:54:55.149 --> 01:54:55.159 align:start position:0%
anything further for any of them if not
 
01:54:56.550 --> 01:54:56.560 align:start position:0%
thank you so much to the commission for
 
01:54:58.149 --> 01:54:58.159 align:start position:0%
coming today and introducing yourselves
 
01:55:01.069 --> 01:55:01.079 align:start position:0%
I guess 2 hours was just about perfect
 
01:55:04.109 --> 01:55:04.119 align:start position:0%
um and uh thank you very much and as
 
01:55:06.510 --> 01:55:06.520 align:start position:0%
chairman I want to thank you for having
 
01:55:10.750 --> 01:55:10.760 align:start position:0%
us here very welcome thank you and uh we
 
01:55:15.149 --> 01:55:15.159 align:start position:0%
will take five six minutes break because
 
01:55:16.910 --> 01:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
uh we have a bill coming up at 11: but
 
01:55:23.750 --> 01:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:25.790 --> 01:55:25.800 align:start position:0%
if everybody's going out you might walk
 
01:55:28.709 --> 01:55:28.719 align:start position:0%
right past Kyle Baker who is one of uh
 
01:55:30.470 --> 01:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
our lobbyists you'll see frequently he
 
01:55:31.990 --> 01:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
can feel free to introduce himself to
 
01:55:33.950 --> 01:55:33.960 align:start position:0%
all of our members as they go
 
01:55:33.960 --> 01:55:36.189 align:start position:0%
all of our members as they go
around

01:55:36.189 --> 01:55:36.199 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:55:38.629 --> 01:55:38.639 align:start position:0%
goes is

02:02:46.030 --> 02:02:46.040 align:start position:0%
it's now after 11: we'll open up our
 
02:02:46.040 --> 02:02:47.149 align:start position:0%
it's now after 11: we'll open up our
public

02:02:47.149 --> 02:02:47.159 align:start position:0%
public
 
02:02:50.189 --> 02:02:50.199 align:start position:0%
hearings and uh our first up will be
 
02:02:53.430 --> 02:02:53.440 align:start position:0%
dealing with hb21 relative to the use of
 
02:02:56.470 --> 02:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
air rifles for hunting game and I will
 
02:02:59.109 --> 02:02:59.119 align:start position:0%
recognize representative James Spain uh
 
02:03:02.629 --> 02:03:02.639 align:start position:0%
as a prime sponsor to um to start us
 
02:03:05.430 --> 02:03:05.440 align:start position:0%
off thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
02:03:08.990 --> 02:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
committee this bill has been uh second
 
02:03:11.629 --> 02:03:11.639 align:start position:0%
two terms in the in the works um we had
 
02:03:13.990 --> 02:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
an original bill that would open up the
 
02:03:19.589 --> 02:03:19.599 align:start position:0%
idea last year um we retained that um
 
02:03:21.229 --> 02:03:21.239 align:start position:0%
studied it over the summer and we
 
02:03:22.790 --> 02:03:22.800 align:start position:0%
actually had
 
02:03:26.510 --> 02:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
very uh very good field trip over to SIG
 
02:03:29.430 --> 02:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
arms where the committee showed up the
 
02:03:31.149 --> 02:03:31.159 align:start position:0%
commission showed up and the department
 
02:03:36.310 --> 02:03:36.320 align:start position:0%
showed up and uh we proved the the uh
 
02:03:38.470 --> 02:03:38.480 align:start position:0%
viability and
 
02:03:43.069 --> 02:03:43.079 align:start position:0%
um and lethality of these larger boore
 
02:03:45.990 --> 02:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
air rifles and uh determined that they
 
02:03:49.709 --> 02:03:49.719 align:start position:0%
were appropriate for hunting big game so
 
02:03:52.390 --> 02:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
this bill will expand the use of air
 
02:03:55.030 --> 02:03:55.040 align:start position:0%
rifles from small game to large game
 
02:03:57.950 --> 02:03:57.960 align:start position:0%
following certain
 
02:04:00.750 --> 02:04:00.760 align:start position:0%
uh qualifications that we determined on
 
02:04:04.870 --> 02:04:04.880 align:start position:0%
the Range were necessary to make them uh
 
02:04:09.350 --> 02:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
work so
 
02:04:11.910 --> 02:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
hp21 the language for that has come
 
02:04:15.229 --> 02:04:15.239 align:start position:0%
directly through firsthand experience of
 
02:04:16.870 --> 02:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
the committee the commission and the
 
02:04:19.069 --> 02:04:19.079 align:start position:0%
department um it was drafted very
 
02:04:22.709 --> 02:04:22.719 align:start position:0%
carefully and reviewed um we actually
 
02:04:24.750 --> 02:04:24.760 align:start position:0%
went about this a different way than
 
02:04:26.950 --> 02:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
they have in some other states it's
 
02:04:28.669 --> 02:04:28.679 align:start position:0%
enacted in Maine and they allow it in
 
02:04:31.950 --> 02:04:31.960 align:start position:0%
Maine but um it's not done appropriately
 
02:04:35.830 --> 02:04:35.840 align:start position:0%
in Maine to what we've determined on the
 
02:04:39.030 --> 02:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
Range in Maine they just simply say 30
 
02:04:41.270 --> 02:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
caliber and above but what we found
 
02:04:42.990 --> 02:04:43.000 align:start position:0%
firsthand while shooting into ballistic
 
02:04:46.350 --> 02:04:46.360 align:start position:0%
gelatin and such is that um 30 caliber
 
02:04:48.109 --> 02:04:48.119 align:start position:0%
just doesn't have the penetration
 
02:04:50.229 --> 02:04:50.239 align:start position:0%
necessary and what we determined is it
 
02:04:51.950 --> 02:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter what the caliber is is it
 
02:04:53.870 --> 02:04:53.880 align:start position:0%
really matters how many how much kinetic
 
02:04:57.669 --> 02:04:57.679 align:start position:0%
energy is generated at the muzzle so
 
02:04:59.270 --> 02:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
it's a little different to
 
02:04:59.280 --> 02:05:01.510 align:start position:0%
it's a little different to
see

02:05:01.510 --> 02:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
see
 
02:05:05.310 --> 02:05:05.320 align:start position:0%
hunting put forward without a specific
 
02:05:08.750 --> 02:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
caliber but I don't want anybody to be
 
02:05:11.510 --> 02:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
shy about that because as you'll hear
 
02:05:13.149 --> 02:05:13.159 align:start position:0%
from the Department when they testify on
 
02:05:16.669 --> 02:05:16.679 align:start position:0%
it if they do um we very carefully
 
02:05:19.790 --> 02:05:19.800 align:start position:0%
looked at the the penetration available
 
02:05:21.790 --> 02:05:21.800 align:start position:0%
for the different calibers and the
 
02:05:23.790 --> 02:05:23.800 align:start position:0%
different uh kinetic energy that was
 
02:05:25.830 --> 02:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
generated at the muzzle for all of
 
02:05:29.790 --> 02:05:29.800 align:start position:0%
those as such uh late breaking I had to
 
02:05:31.589 --> 02:05:31.599 align:start position:0%
draft an amendment to this that we will
 
02:05:34.990 --> 02:05:35.000 align:start position:0%
hear in exec during exec session if
 
02:05:38.709 --> 02:05:38.719 align:start position:0%
uh we get a chance and so a copy of this
 
02:05:40.950 --> 02:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
amendment I can pass around to everybody
 
02:05:42.709 --> 02:05:42.719 align:start position:0%
so you can take this into account while
 
02:05:46.589 --> 02:05:46.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:46.599 --> 02:05:48.149 align:start position:0%
 
this

02:05:48.149 --> 02:05:48.159 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:05:50.990 --> 02:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
um the department decided at the last
 
02:05:52.950 --> 02:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
minute that they they would like to have
 
02:05:54.510 --> 02:05:54.520 align:start position:0%
the kinetic energy at the muzzle
 
02:05:56.990 --> 02:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
determined not in statute where it's
 
02:05:59.790 --> 02:05:59.800 align:start position:0%
stock in statute but actually in rules
 
02:06:03.830 --> 02:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
that the the the department makes uh as
 
02:06:06.069 --> 02:06:06.079 align:start position:0%
part of regular hunting rules so that
 
02:06:09.189 --> 02:06:09.199 align:start position:0%
they could then separate out how much
 
02:06:11.069 --> 02:06:11.079 align:start position:0%
kinetic energy is needed for the deer
 
02:06:13.270 --> 02:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
hunting portion versus the moose or the
 
02:06:15.109 --> 02:06:15.119 align:start position:0%
bear portion and they could increase
 
02:06:16.870 --> 02:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
that kinetic energy required for those
 
02:06:19.629 --> 02:06:19.639 align:start position:0%
larger game species and it also allows
 
02:06:21.270 --> 02:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
them as technology continues to keep
 
02:06:23.750 --> 02:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
Improv proving with these air rifles to
 
02:06:27.310 --> 02:06:27.320 align:start position:0%
change that as needed and uh and further
 
02:06:30.430 --> 02:06:30.440 align:start position:0%
refine the the uh kinetic energy uh the
 
02:06:32.310 --> 02:06:32.320 align:start position:0%
foot pounds that's generated at the
 
02:06:37.790 --> 02:06:37.800 align:start position:0%
muzzle of the gun and so with that I
 
02:06:41.149 --> 02:06:41.159 align:start position:0%
will go ahead and end my testimony and
 
02:06:42.830 --> 02:06:42.840 align:start position:0%
introduction uh and I'll take any
 
02:06:44.990 --> 02:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
questions if you've got
 
02:06:48.790 --> 02:06:48.800 align:start position:0%
them any questions for representative
 
02:06:52.430 --> 02:06:52.440 align:start position:0%
Spain Miss representative mcferson yes
 
02:06:56.709 --> 02:06:56.719 align:start position:0%
thank you um I am new to the committee I
 
02:07:00.669 --> 02:07:00.679 align:start position:0%
am not a hunter so my question is um why
 
02:07:05.910 --> 02:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
an air rifle so air rifles are new
 
02:07:08.990 --> 02:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
technology uh they are being accepted in
 
02:07:12.229 --> 02:07:12.239 align:start position:0%
multiple States across the US um they
 
02:07:14.470 --> 02:07:14.480 align:start position:0%
are not your typical air rifle that you
 
02:07:16.229 --> 02:07:16.239 align:start position:0%
think of when you think of a Daisy BB
 
02:07:18.149 --> 02:07:18.159 align:start position:0%
gun you don't just pump the gun and
 
02:07:20.910 --> 02:07:20.920 align:start position:0%
shoot it it doesn't have a CO2 cartridge
 
02:07:23.109 --> 02:07:23.119 align:start position:0%
it has a large tank that's filled from
 
02:07:23.119 --> 02:07:24.669 align:start position:0%
it has a large tank that's filled from
diving

02:07:24.669 --> 02:07:24.679 align:start position:0%
diving
 
02:07:27.109 --> 02:07:27.119 align:start position:0%
tanks you can get about five shots out
 
02:07:28.870 --> 02:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
of that tank and then you have to refill
 
02:07:31.149 --> 02:07:31.159 align:start position:0%
it five shots is pretty convenient
 
02:07:32.750 --> 02:07:32.760 align:start position:0%
because that's how many rounds we
 
02:07:34.390 --> 02:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
usually let somebody take when they go
 
02:07:37.270 --> 02:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
out deer hunting so essentially if you
 
02:07:39.910 --> 02:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
think of the air rifle as a muzzle
 
02:07:42.750 --> 02:07:42.760 align:start position:0%
loader that's using air instead of
 
02:07:45.870 --> 02:07:45.880 align:start position:0%
powder that's what we're at and so one
 
02:07:48.270 --> 02:07:48.280 align:start position:0%
of the guns that we shot was a 54
 
02:07:51.069 --> 02:07:51.079 align:start position:0%
caliber wow perfectly acceptable for
 
02:07:53.510 --> 02:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
taking down bar and moose as was proven
 
02:07:55.910 --> 02:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
on the Range the penetration into the
 
02:07:57.790 --> 02:07:57.800 align:start position:0%
gelatin block for that went right
 
02:07:59.270 --> 02:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
through the back end and we're talking
 
02:08:01.669 --> 02:08:01.679 align:start position:0%
about an 18inch deep gelatin
 
02:08:04.270 --> 02:08:04.280 align:start position:0%
block the devastation of the wound
 
02:08:07.310 --> 02:08:07.320 align:start position:0%
channel was amazing the hollow point
 
02:08:11.350 --> 02:08:11.360 align:start position:0%
projectile that was used was uh fully
 
02:08:13.669 --> 02:08:13.679 align:start position:0%
expanded and
 
02:08:16.510 --> 02:08:16.520 align:start position:0%
um so anybody who was taking this out
 
02:08:18.830 --> 02:08:18.840 align:start position:0%
hunting you'd be hunting essentially
 
02:08:20.350 --> 02:08:20.360 align:start position:0%
like it was a muzzle loader but without
 
02:08:23.390 --> 02:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
the powder and using an air tank
 
02:08:23.400 --> 02:08:24.910 align:start position:0%
the powder and using an air tank
instead

02:08:24.910 --> 02:08:24.920 align:start position:0%
instead
 
02:08:27.990 --> 02:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
followup followup who brought the bill
 
02:08:31.229 --> 02:08:31.239 align:start position:0%
forward I mean who proposed it the one
 
02:08:32.750 --> 02:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
last year was brought forward by
 
02:08:34.390 --> 02:08:34.400 align:start position:0%
representative Cole and he will be
 
02:08:39.109 --> 02:08:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:41.270 --> 02:08:41.280 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
02:08:43.430 --> 02:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
Harvey thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
02:08:47.270 --> 02:08:47.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question um so I I'm pleased
 
02:08:50.030 --> 02:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
that you have an amendment that will
 
02:08:52.629 --> 02:08:52.639 align:start position:0%
allow um
 
02:08:56.629 --> 02:08:56.639 align:start position:0%
um the oh and I'm not using using the
 
02:08:59.229 --> 02:08:59.239 align:start position:0%
right word the um kinetic energy to be
 
02:09:02.549 --> 02:09:02.559 align:start position:0%
placed in rules but my question is
 
02:09:04.790 --> 02:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
should this whole thing be placed in
 
02:09:08.069 --> 02:09:08.079 align:start position:0%
rules should it be part of um fishing
 
02:09:08.079 --> 02:09:09.149 align:start position:0%
rules should it be part of um fishing
games

02:09:09.149 --> 02:09:09.159 align:start position:0%
games
 
02:09:14.629 --> 02:09:14.639 align:start position:0%
rules procedure to allow hunting by air
 
02:09:16.750 --> 02:09:16.760 align:start position:0%
rifles the department said they needed
 
02:09:18.950 --> 02:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
this in statute first and then they
 
02:09:26.510 --> 02:09:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:26.520 --> 02:09:28.669 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:09:28.669 --> 02:09:28.679 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:09:31.189 --> 02:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
Durkin thank you Mr chair um question
 
02:09:32.910 --> 02:09:32.920 align:start position:0%
for you on the projectile is it
 
02:09:35.750 --> 02:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
basically the same kind of projectile
 
02:09:38.910 --> 02:09:38.920 align:start position:0%
that is fired out of a powed gun it's a
 
02:09:42.030 --> 02:09:42.040 align:start position:0%
lead projectile and in the shape and
 
02:09:45.589 --> 02:09:45.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:48.750 --> 02:09:48.760 align:start position:0%
it representative KH thank you Mr
 
02:09:50.430 --> 02:09:50.440 align:start position:0%
chairman representative thank you for
 
02:09:53.589 --> 02:09:53.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:56.629 --> 02:09:56.639 align:start position:0%
um representative here we see that we
 
02:09:58.350 --> 02:09:58.360 align:start position:0%
giving the authority uh to the
 
02:10:00.470 --> 02:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
commission to creating administrative
 
02:10:03.390 --> 02:10:03.400 align:start position:0%
and hunting rules uh knowing the
 
02:10:06.350 --> 02:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
technology is going so fast you
 
02:10:09.390 --> 02:10:09.400 align:start position:0%
overnight maybe the someday maybe in
 
02:10:11.229 --> 02:10:11.239 align:start position:0%
couple of years we're not going to need
 
02:10:13.390 --> 02:10:13.400 align:start position:0%
any tanks you know we will have you know
 
02:10:15.950 --> 02:10:15.960 align:start position:0%
better technology is it in anywhere in
 
02:10:18.510 --> 02:10:18.520 align:start position:0%
this bill has that the commission will
 
02:10:21.830 --> 02:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
have the power to change any any any
 
02:10:23.990 --> 02:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
rules that needed you know for the
 
02:10:27.030 --> 02:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
future technology once this base
 
02:10:29.149 --> 02:10:29.159 align:start position:0%
legislation is in they can craft all the
 
02:10:31.470 --> 02:10:31.480 align:start position:0%
rules they need around that and
 
02:10:32.910 --> 02:10:32.920 align:start position:0%
especially now that we've also taken out
 
02:10:34.870 --> 02:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
the kinetic energy at the muzzle they
 
02:10:38.149 --> 02:10:38.159 align:start position:0%
can change that kinetic energy amount uh
 
02:10:40.390 --> 02:10:40.400 align:start position:0%
as needed there's nothing in here that
 
02:10:42.470 --> 02:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
defines what the gun looks like whether
 
02:10:45.069 --> 02:10:45.079 align:start position:0%
it has a big tank or not so that kind of
 
02:10:47.430 --> 02:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
innovation and Technology won't be
 
02:10:47.440 --> 02:10:52.870 align:start position:0%
innovation and Technology won't be
affected

02:10:52.870 --> 02:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:56.229 --> 02:10:56.239 align:start position:0%
um not terribly related to the bill but
 
02:10:59.510 --> 02:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
just really curious so you stated that
 
02:11:01.830 --> 02:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
you could get five rounds before you
 
02:11:06.430 --> 02:11:06.440 align:start position:0%
needed to um basically reload uh from an
 
02:11:09.790 --> 02:11:09.800 align:start position:0%
A a tank do you carry that tank with you
 
02:11:12.709 --> 02:11:12.719 align:start position:0%
they did yes uh it's just like a diving
 
02:11:14.189 --> 02:11:14.199 align:start position:0%
tank like you would wear if you're if
 
02:11:16.750 --> 02:11:16.760 align:start position:0%
you're diving in the
 
02:11:19.910 --> 02:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
ocean okay weird they didn't carry it in
 
02:11:21.390 --> 02:11:21.400 align:start position:0%
the field with them but they if they
 
02:11:24.270 --> 02:11:24.280 align:start position:0%
going out to a cabin to go hunting they
 
02:11:27.030 --> 02:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
would bring that tank to the cabin um
 
02:11:28.350 --> 02:11:28.360 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that's interesting
 
02:11:30.669 --> 02:11:30.679 align:start position:0%
about these rifles is um you know you
 
02:11:33.270 --> 02:11:33.280 align:start position:0%
know that as it gets colder pressure
 
02:11:35.589 --> 02:11:35.599 align:start position:0%
changes and one of the things we had for
 
02:11:37.470 --> 02:11:37.480 align:start position:0%
a question for them on the on the course
 
02:11:39.870 --> 02:11:39.880 align:start position:0%
was well how do you handle a really cold
 
02:11:42.990 --> 02:11:43.000 align:start position:0%
morning and the answers made me feel
 
02:11:44.510 --> 02:11:44.520 align:start position:0%
kind of stupid for not thinking about it
 
02:11:45.790 --> 02:11:45.800 align:start position:0%
but they said you fill it outside and
 
02:11:47.510 --> 02:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
you leave the gun outside on the on the
 
02:11:49.510 --> 02:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
porch and then it doesn't change
 
02:11:51.030 --> 02:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
temperature if you fill it inside in the
 
02:11:52.430 --> 02:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
war warm cabin and go out in the cold
 
02:11:53.709 --> 02:11:53.719 align:start position:0%
you're going to have less pressure but
 
02:11:54.910 --> 02:11:54.920 align:start position:0%
if you fill it outside and leave it
 
02:11:58.990 --> 02:11:59.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:02.310 --> 02:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
same representative
 
02:12:04.629 --> 02:12:04.639 align:start position:0%
Durkin thank you Mr chair uh thank you
 
02:12:07.189 --> 02:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um so has a five
 
02:12:10.390 --> 02:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
shot Max on a tank we determined that
 
02:12:13.270 --> 02:12:13.280 align:start position:0%
five shots gives you yes the and then
 
02:12:14.870 --> 02:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
you're going to hit a warning on the on
 
02:12:18.390 --> 02:12:18.400 align:start position:0%
the level of your uh air in the tank and
 
02:12:19.870 --> 02:12:19.880 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to fill it up again
 
02:12:21.350 --> 02:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
okay so followup yeah that was my
 
02:12:22.990 --> 02:12:23.000 align:start position:0%
followup is there a sensor or something
 
02:12:24.950 --> 02:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
that'll after that some of them have
 
02:12:27.510 --> 02:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
gauges some of them you just have to
 
02:12:29.430 --> 02:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
count because you know it's going to be
 
02:12:32.709 --> 02:12:32.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:36.510 --> 02:12:36.520 align:start position:0%
one representative tutor um we follow up
 
02:12:38.430 --> 02:12:38.440 align:start position:0%
to this my original question was so
 
02:12:42.189 --> 02:12:42.199 align:start position:0%
there's no mechanism on the weapon to
 
02:12:44.030 --> 02:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
prevent the gun from firing when the
 
02:12:46.109 --> 02:12:46.119 align:start position:0%
pressure drops below X so that some of
 
02:12:48.270 --> 02:12:48.280 align:start position:0%
them did energy is going to be below
 
02:12:49.990 --> 02:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
what we want yeah some of them had built
 
02:12:51.669 --> 02:12:51.679 align:start position:0%
in Regulators as well that wouldn't
 
02:12:53.830 --> 02:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
allow the the pressure to come out too
 
02:12:59.589 --> 02:12:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:02.030 --> 02:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
soft those are all aspects of the gun
 
02:13:02.040 --> 02:13:04.390 align:start position:0%
soft those are all aspects of the gun
manufacturer

02:13:04.390 --> 02:13:04.400 align:start position:0%
manufacturer
 
02:13:06.549 --> 02:13:06.559 align:start position:0%
though any other questions for
 
02:13:06.559 --> 02:13:09.310 align:start position:0%
though any other questions for
representative

02:13:09.310 --> 02:13:09.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:14.589 --> 02:13:14.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:17.629 --> 02:13:17.639 align:start position:0%
much next up we would like to have uh
 
02:13:26.750 --> 02:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:28.549 --> 02:13:28.559 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair or vice chairman
 
02:13:31.430 --> 02:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
roulette and members of the fishing game
 
02:13:33.390 --> 02:13:33.400 align:start position:0%
so let's address a couple of the
 
02:13:36.750 --> 02:13:36.760 align:start position:0%
questions I already heard out there five
 
02:13:39.069 --> 02:13:39.079 align:start position:0%
shots you're in an air rifle you're
 
02:13:41.069 --> 02:13:41.079 align:start position:0%
taking a shot you're loading around
 
02:13:43.589 --> 02:13:43.599 align:start position:0%
you're taking a shot you do not have
 
02:13:46.589 --> 02:13:46.599 align:start position:0%
time to take five shots when you're out
 
02:13:49.149 --> 02:13:49.159 align:start position:0%
hunting if you're beyond three
 
02:13:52.470 --> 02:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
shots you know you probably shouldn't be
 
02:13:54.870 --> 02:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
hunting all
 
02:13:59.549 --> 02:13:59.559 align:start position:0%
right we did an interim study on this um
 
02:14:01.790 --> 02:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
he adjust he addressed the ballistics
 
02:14:05.030 --> 02:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
gel which gave you the impact the
 
02:14:06.270 --> 02:14:06.280 align:start position:0%
velocity of the
 
02:14:08.510 --> 02:14:08.520 align:start position:0%
weapon to address two other things that
 
02:14:11.310 --> 02:14:11.320 align:start position:0%
we tested on the Range we tested the
 
02:14:14.310 --> 02:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
foot speed of the velocity of the
 
02:14:16.470 --> 02:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
rounds so when you're targeting
 
02:14:19.430 --> 02:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
something from far away you could take
 
02:14:22.270 --> 02:14:22.280 align:start position:0%
three to five shots and you're not going
 
02:14:24.990 --> 02:14:25.000 align:start position:0%
to drop down that menu shot will be in
 
02:14:25.910 --> 02:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
the same
 
02:14:28.709 --> 02:14:28.719 align:start position:0%
placement that's very important so
 
02:14:29.790 --> 02:14:29.800 align:start position:0%
you're not
 
02:14:32.030 --> 02:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
losing velocity when you're shooting
 
02:14:34.310 --> 02:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
these these guns you're not losing the
 
02:14:36.549 --> 02:14:36.559 align:start position:0%
pressure you're not losing the impact
 
02:14:38.870 --> 02:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
the gun is going to perform the same
 
02:14:40.470 --> 02:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
over the three to five
 
02:14:43.310 --> 02:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
shots okay when you're out there hunting
 
02:14:45.149 --> 02:14:45.159 align:start position:0%
that's important to
 
02:14:47.870 --> 02:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
know um that was the air speeds test
 
02:14:49.510 --> 02:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
that was the airdrop test we did the
 
02:14:52.790 --> 02:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
ballistics test we determined that 30
 
02:14:55.870 --> 02:14:55.880 align:start position:0%
caliber due to the foot-pound range of
 
02:14:58.669 --> 02:14:58.679 align:start position:0%
200 foot-pounds was not sufficient to
 
02:15:02.629 --> 02:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
take down an animal and make it ethical
 
02:15:04.709 --> 02:15:04.719 align:start position:0%
that's why we gave the foot pounds to
 
02:15:06.149 --> 02:15:06.159 align:start position:0%
the fishing game department to determine
 
02:15:07.030 --> 02:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
what is
 
02:15:09.669 --> 02:15:09.679 align:start position:0%
ethical so it'll be anything beyond a 30
 
02:15:12.950 --> 02:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
caliber up to 45 caliber now these
 
02:15:15.149 --> 02:15:15.159 align:start position:0%
weapons take down water
 
02:15:17.870 --> 02:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
buffalo it's not a it's not a small
 
02:15:19.950 --> 02:15:19.960 align:start position:0%
weapon it's very
 
02:15:24.109 --> 02:15:24.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:26.149 --> 02:15:26.159 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
02:15:29.069 --> 02:15:29.079 align:start position:0%
mcferson thank you um I may have missed
 
02:15:31.390 --> 02:15:31.400 align:start position:0%
something these are not semi-automatic
 
02:15:34.430 --> 02:15:34.440 align:start position:0%
they are not so you fire then load
 
02:15:36.430 --> 02:15:36.440 align:start position:0%
correct similar to a muzzle loader
 
02:15:40.629 --> 02:15:40.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:43.870 --> 02:15:43.880 align:start position:0%
yes representative Stone well we're not
 
02:15:46.549 --> 02:15:46.559 align:start position:0%
talking about air rifles are we yes air
 
02:15:49.430 --> 02:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
pressure rifles 30 caliber 50 caliber up
 
02:15:52.669 --> 02:15:52.679 align:start position:0%
to 54 caliber yeah are they legal enough
 
02:15:55.189 --> 02:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
to take the de take a deer down they
 
02:15:57.270 --> 02:15:57.280 align:start position:0%
will take down a water buffalo sir they
 
02:16:00.109 --> 02:16:00.119 align:start position:0%
will okay yes at Le you know like you
 
02:16:02.270 --> 02:16:02.280 align:start position:0%
said five shots I never
 
02:16:04.470 --> 02:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
shidea as far as I know they're illegal
 
02:16:07.709 --> 02:16:07.719 align:start position:0%
in Colorado and Maine and Colonel Jordan
 
02:16:09.270 --> 02:16:09.280 align:start position:0%
can testify to any other states that
 
02:16:11.270 --> 02:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
have legalized it when I when I hunt I
 
02:16:13.629 --> 02:16:13.639 align:start position:0%
take him down one shot you know kill him
 
02:16:15.350 --> 02:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
one shot if you have to food through
 
02:16:16.950 --> 02:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
five times you shouldn't be in the woods
 
02:16:18.830 --> 02:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
in the first place thank you sir that's
 
02:16:23.149 --> 02:16:23.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:26.350 --> 02:16:26.360 align:start position:0%
any other questions for representative
 
02:16:28.950 --> 02:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
Cole seeing none thank you thank you
 
02:16:28.960 --> 02:16:34.830 align:start position:0%
Cole seeing none thank you thank you
very

02:16:34.830 --> 02:16:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:38.469 --> 02:16:38.479 align:start position:0%
much are there any other uh attendees
 
02:16:40.709 --> 02:16:40.719 align:start position:0%
who would like to test uh give testimony
 
02:16:40.719 --> 02:16:44.070 align:start position:0%
who would like to test uh give testimony
on

02:16:44.070 --> 02:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:47.990 --> 02:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
this Mr berser on need a sorry I thought
 
02:16:49.669 --> 02:16:49.679 align:start position:0%
a card had already been submitted I
 
02:16:52.110 --> 02:16:52.120 align:start position:0%
apologize um yeah Dan buron chief of the
 
02:16:53.389 --> 02:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
wildlife division for New Hampshire
 
02:16:56.070 --> 02:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
fishing game um I'd like to thank
 
02:16:57.750 --> 02:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
representative Spain for working with us
 
02:17:00.150 --> 02:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
on this and U with offering this
 
02:17:02.110 --> 02:17:02.120 align:start position:0%
amendment to allow us to set the you
 
02:17:05.030 --> 02:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
know foot pounds of energy in rule um I
 
02:17:06.910 --> 02:17:06.920 align:start position:0%
think comparing these to a muzzle loer
 
02:17:10.150 --> 02:17:10.160 align:start position:0%
is is a good way to look at things um um
 
02:17:12.790 --> 02:17:12.800 align:start position:0%
they are not your typical air rifle um
 
02:17:14.709 --> 02:17:14.719 align:start position:0%
so if anyone has a picture of like you'd
 
02:17:16.669 --> 02:17:16.679 align:start position:0%
said you know the Daisy Red Rider baby
 
02:17:18.509 --> 02:17:18.519 align:start position:0%
gun in your head these are not what
 
02:17:20.589 --> 02:17:20.599 align:start position:0%
those are um you can you can Google
 
02:17:22.349 --> 02:17:22.359 align:start position:0%
these things and you can find videos
 
02:17:25.469 --> 02:17:25.479 align:start position:0%
they are large they are very loud um
 
02:17:26.990 --> 02:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
much louder than I think most people
 
02:17:29.429 --> 02:17:29.439 align:start position:0%
would anticipate so when you take a shot
 
02:17:31.750 --> 02:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
if you miss um by and large that animal
 
02:17:34.389 --> 02:17:34.399 align:start position:0%
is is running um and that is the case
 
02:17:37.030 --> 02:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
with with really all types of firearms
 
02:17:38.629 --> 02:17:38.639 align:start position:0%
um so the department did have some
 
02:17:40.469 --> 02:17:40.479 align:start position:0%
initial concerns you know when this was
 
02:17:42.990 --> 02:17:43.000 align:start position:0%
when this was uh presented last last
 
02:17:45.870 --> 02:17:45.880 align:start position:0%
year um again in large part because I
 
02:17:47.870 --> 02:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
think it focused more on the caliber and
 
02:17:50.389 --> 02:17:50.399 align:start position:0%
again with an air rifle um if you have a
 
02:17:52.950 --> 02:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
large caliber but no air air pressure
 
02:17:56.190 --> 02:17:56.200 align:start position:0%
behind that um the concern is is Humane
 
02:17:58.190 --> 02:17:58.200 align:start position:0%
um take of an animal um that's always
 
02:17:59.549 --> 02:17:59.559 align:start position:0%
the concern of the department when we're
 
02:18:02.950 --> 02:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
looking at any of these new weapons um
 
02:18:04.790 --> 02:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
we appreciate having this ability to do
 
02:18:06.150 --> 02:18:06.160 align:start position:0%
this in Rule and I think the amendment
 
02:18:07.790 --> 02:18:07.800 align:start position:0%
gives us the flexibility to do what we
 
02:18:10.950 --> 02:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
need um I think a good example and and
 
02:18:13.830 --> 02:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
Cory to this is um some of the changes
 
02:18:16.190 --> 02:18:16.200 align:start position:0%
we've made in allowable shot for turkeys
 
02:18:17.830 --> 02:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
so for example we didn't used to allow
 
02:18:21.070 --> 02:18:21.080 align:start position:0%
410 um gauge shotguns for turkeys um
 
02:18:23.070 --> 02:18:23.080 align:start position:0%
there was advancements in in the
 
02:18:25.790 --> 02:18:25.800 align:start position:0%
ammunition where there's these um TSS
 
02:18:28.150 --> 02:18:28.160 align:start position:0%
loads that are made of tungsten um so
 
02:18:29.589 --> 02:18:29.599 align:start position:0%
the ballistics and those are very
 
02:18:33.349 --> 02:18:33.359 align:start position:0%
similar to other shot that we allowed um
 
02:18:36.190 --> 02:18:36.200 align:start position:0%
so we now allow those en roll um these
 
02:18:38.270 --> 02:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
companies continue to innovate um they
 
02:18:40.270 --> 02:18:40.280 align:start position:0%
find ways to increase ballistics of
 
02:18:41.629 --> 02:18:41.639 align:start position:0%
different ammunitions and different
 
02:18:43.790 --> 02:18:43.800 align:start position:0%
weapons um so that's why we like to have
 
02:18:45.509 --> 02:18:45.519 align:start position:0%
this ability to be flexible and Rule and
 
02:18:48.509 --> 02:18:48.519 align:start position:0%
change these things as they go um uh my
 
02:18:50.950 --> 02:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
conversations with representativ Spain
 
02:18:53.709 --> 02:18:53.719 align:start position:0%
we actually um in anticipation of of
 
02:18:55.309 --> 02:18:55.319 align:start position:0%
this bill coming through we actually we
 
02:18:57.349 --> 02:18:57.359 align:start position:0%
are in a season setting year right now
 
02:18:59.309 --> 02:18:59.319 align:start position:0%
we're offering um we're putting forward
 
02:19:01.629 --> 02:19:01.639 align:start position:0%
draft proposals for our Wildlife rules
 
02:19:04.070 --> 02:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
that um focus on method and manner of
 
02:19:06.750 --> 02:19:06.760 align:start position:0%
take and season length and timing um so
 
02:19:09.389 --> 02:19:09.399 align:start position:0%
our our species biologists are looking
 
02:19:12.030 --> 02:19:12.040 align:start position:0%
at ballistics and what other states do
 
02:19:13.790 --> 02:19:13.800 align:start position:0%
um and they will have proposals that go
 
02:19:17.790 --> 02:19:17.800 align:start position:0%
out to the public this year um for um
 
02:19:19.830 --> 02:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
well likely the the restrictions for
 
02:19:21.230 --> 02:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
these will probably be the the same for
 
02:19:23.830 --> 02:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
deer and bear um typically ballistics
 
02:19:25.190 --> 02:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
for something that you know would take
 
02:19:26.750 --> 02:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
down a deer would be would be sufficient
 
02:19:28.790 --> 02:19:28.800 align:start position:0%
for a bear as well um the big difference
 
02:19:32.070 --> 02:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
will be Moose for certain um so we would
 
02:19:33.429 --> 02:19:33.439 align:start position:0%
want something certainly more powerful
 
02:19:34.830 --> 02:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
to take down an animal as large as a
 
02:19:36.750 --> 02:19:36.760 align:start position:0%
moose um but again we appreciate the
 
02:19:38.429 --> 02:19:38.439 align:start position:0%
flexibility to be able to do that in
 
02:19:41.190 --> 02:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
rule um and I I think with that I can I
 
02:19:42.990 --> 02:19:43.000 align:start position:0%
can answer any
 
02:19:46.990 --> 02:19:47.000 align:start position:0%
questions representative KH thank you Mr
 
02:19:51.870 --> 02:19:51.880 align:start position:0%
chairman Mr Bor uh what is step uh the
 
02:19:54.510 --> 02:19:54.520 align:start position:0%
department is taking uh if if it is
 
02:19:58.830 --> 02:19:58.840 align:start position:0%
becomes law on the uh for the law
 
02:20:00.830 --> 02:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement agency this is not a toy
 
02:20:03.830 --> 02:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
right this is a real gun correct and and
 
02:20:06.110 --> 02:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
what step you're taking to educate our
 
02:20:08.590 --> 02:20:08.600 align:start position:0%
law enforcement agency the town and
 
02:20:11.309 --> 02:20:11.319 align:start position:0%
cities and everybody you know that uh
 
02:20:13.950 --> 02:20:13.960 align:start position:0%
they know what is coming up in the
 
02:20:16.469 --> 02:20:16.479 align:start position:0%
market so to educate local law
 
02:20:18.750 --> 02:20:18.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement or the state law you know
 
02:20:22.389 --> 02:20:22.399 align:start position:0%
all together everybody yeah so um so
 
02:20:24.550 --> 02:20:24.560 align:start position:0%
it's these these weapons are currently
 
02:20:26.870 --> 02:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
allowable for you know for anyone to to
 
02:20:29.110 --> 02:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
shoot so they're you can own them you
 
02:20:30.790 --> 02:20:30.800 align:start position:0%
can shoot them the the difference is
 
02:20:32.950 --> 02:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
that you can now take game with them um
 
02:20:34.950 --> 02:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
so likely local law enforcement are
 
02:20:36.550 --> 02:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
already aware of the existence of these
 
02:20:38.070 --> 02:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
the difference would be now you can just
 
02:20:40.070 --> 02:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
now you can use them to hunt with but um
 
02:20:43.670 --> 02:20:43.680 align:start position:0%
by and large um you know these would be
 
02:20:45.270 --> 02:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
um these would be more on par with you
 
02:20:47.110 --> 02:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
know shotguns and muzzle loaders which
 
02:20:49.750 --> 02:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
are typically um these are typically the
 
02:20:51.190 --> 02:20:51.200 align:start position:0%
types of firearms that that are allowed
 
02:20:52.590 --> 02:20:52.600 align:start position:0%
in you know areas that are more
 
02:20:54.030 --> 02:20:54.040 align:start position:0%
congested because again they're not
 
02:20:55.389 --> 02:20:55.399 align:start position:0%
quite as powerful as high powerered
 
02:20:58.270 --> 02:20:58.280 align:start position:0%
rifles so um you know some of the areas
 
02:20:59.950 --> 02:20:59.960 align:start position:0%
um in your neck of the woods in the Sea
 
02:21:01.150 --> 02:21:01.160 align:start position:0%
Coast and the southern portion of the
 
02:21:02.590 --> 02:21:02.600 align:start position:0%
state have areas that are shotgun or
 
02:21:05.110 --> 02:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
muzzle loader only due to safety concern
 
02:21:06.790 --> 02:21:06.800 align:start position:0%
so these would be more along those lines
 
02:21:09.590 --> 02:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:11.990 --> 02:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
with representative
 
02:21:14.469 --> 02:21:14.479 align:start position:0%
tutor uh thank you Mr chair thanks for
 
02:21:16.469 --> 02:21:16.479 align:start position:0%
taking my question my I guess my
 
02:21:18.990 --> 02:21:19.000 align:start position:0%
question is on enforcement I'm not sure
 
02:21:21.429 --> 02:21:21.439 align:start position:0%
what the variation is from manufacturer
 
02:21:24.070 --> 02:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
to manufacturer on the weapons and what
 
02:21:25.950 --> 02:21:25.960 align:start position:0%
velocities they put out for a particular
 
02:21:27.790 --> 02:21:27.800 align:start position:0%
caliber but how would you enforce the
 
02:21:30.910 --> 02:21:30.920 align:start position:0%
energy number yeah I'll I'll defer to
 
02:21:32.469 --> 02:21:32.479 align:start position:0%
The Colonel on that if he wants to come
 
02:21:35.990 --> 02:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
up and answer that um it it will be a
 
02:21:38.110 --> 02:21:38.120 align:start position:0%
little bit more difficult um because
 
02:21:40.550 --> 02:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
again it's it's it's slightly different
 
02:21:42.590 --> 02:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
from your typical firearm where there's
 
02:21:44.670 --> 02:21:44.680 align:start position:0%
mass-produced ammunition that typically
 
02:21:47.309 --> 02:21:47.319 align:start position:0%
all has you know similar ballistics um
 
02:21:48.710 --> 02:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
that will be a little bit more of a
 
02:21:51.150 --> 02:21:51.160 align:start position:0%
challenge although you know individ load
 
02:21:53.870 --> 02:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
their own ammunition there's um um you
 
02:21:55.429 --> 02:21:55.439 align:start position:0%
know we have a really good team of law
 
02:21:57.710 --> 02:21:57.720 align:start position:0%
enforcement I'm assuming that there's
 
02:21:59.710 --> 02:21:59.720 align:start position:0%
you know they're chronographs and things
 
02:22:01.030 --> 02:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
like that there are devices that can
 
02:22:03.910 --> 02:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
measure that um um it will be a bit of a
 
02:22:06.510 --> 02:22:06.520 align:start position:0%
challenge but but
 
02:22:10.469 --> 02:22:10.479 align:start position:0%
um most of these devices um have
 
02:22:12.190 --> 02:22:12.200 align:start position:0%
information on what they're capable of
 
02:22:14.550 --> 02:22:14.560 align:start position:0%
doing and I think my my assumption would
 
02:22:16.110 --> 02:22:16.120 align:start position:0%
be and I'd defer to the colonel that
 
02:22:18.710 --> 02:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
that it would largely um you would
 
02:22:20.230 --> 02:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
largely fall back on whether or not
 
02:22:21.750 --> 02:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
someone was out there with a weapon that
 
02:22:23.830 --> 02:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
was incapable of meeting the
 
02:22:26.750 --> 02:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
requirements um you know muzzle loaders
 
02:22:29.790 --> 02:22:29.800 align:start position:0%
misfire things like that happen um I
 
02:22:31.710 --> 02:22:31.720 align:start position:0%
don't foresee anyone intentionally
 
02:22:34.230 --> 02:22:34.240 align:start position:0%
lowering the pressure on one of these
 
02:22:36.510 --> 02:22:36.520 align:start position:0%
devices because um Hunters are concerned
 
02:22:38.190 --> 02:22:38.200 align:start position:0%
with taking an ethical shot on on their
 
02:22:40.070 --> 02:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
game and retrieving that animal for use
 
02:22:42.550 --> 02:22:42.560 align:start position:0%
so um it would be more along the lines
 
02:22:44.070 --> 02:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
of I think if an individual was in the
 
02:22:46.150 --> 02:22:46.160 align:start position:0%
field with a weapon that was not capable
 
02:22:48.750 --> 02:22:48.760 align:start position:0%
of of producing enough
 
02:22:52.150 --> 02:22:52.160 align:start position:0%
energy representative harv
 
02:22:53.790 --> 02:22:53.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
02:22:56.349 --> 02:22:56.359 align:start position:0%
my question um my question it could you
 
02:23:00.790 --> 02:23:00.800 align:start position:0%
just speak to um I assume we're going to
 
02:23:04.150 --> 02:23:04.160 align:start position:0%
have to have another kind of license
 
02:23:06.630 --> 02:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
then for these these air rifles and so
 
02:23:08.710 --> 02:23:08.720 align:start position:0%
forth in addition to what's already out
 
02:23:10.590 --> 02:23:10.600 align:start position:0%
there so could you just speak a little
 
02:23:13.429 --> 02:23:13.439 align:start position:0%
bit about um you know that licensing
 
02:23:17.630 --> 02:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
process the seasons of take and you know
 
02:23:20.950 --> 02:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
all of that kind of stuff yeah so we we
 
02:23:23.710 --> 02:23:23.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't necessarily need uh I think our
 
02:23:25.349 --> 02:23:25.359 align:start position:0%
initial thought would be that this would
 
02:23:26.870 --> 02:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
be an allowable weapon within our
 
02:23:28.950 --> 02:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
existing firearm
 
02:23:31.349 --> 02:23:31.359 align:start position:0%
season down the road we could consider
 
02:23:33.950 --> 02:23:33.960 align:start position:0%
if we wanted its own season the problem
 
02:23:37.750 --> 02:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
is um so deer is an example so with deer
 
02:23:39.230 --> 02:23:39.240 align:start position:0%
we're kind of near the northern limit of
 
02:23:42.750 --> 02:23:42.760 align:start position:0%
deer range um we particularly with the
 
02:23:44.230 --> 02:23:44.240 align:start position:0%
more mild Winters we've had we have a
 
02:23:47.230 --> 02:23:47.240 align:start position:0%
very healthy deer population so we we
 
02:23:49.190 --> 02:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
are we are able to allow a lot of
 
02:23:51.990 --> 02:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity for folks um that said you
 
02:23:53.870 --> 02:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
know we're not Pennsylvania we're not
 
02:23:56.190 --> 02:23:56.200 align:start position:0%
Connecticut um so we have restricted
 
02:23:58.190 --> 02:23:58.200 align:start position:0%
time frames there's a lot of different
 
02:24:00.110 --> 02:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
um user groups that that like to take
 
02:24:02.510 --> 02:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
advantage so we have archery we have we
 
02:24:04.510 --> 02:24:04.520 align:start position:0%
have muzzle loer we have firearms but
 
02:24:05.950 --> 02:24:05.960 align:start position:0%
even within those there are different
 
02:24:07.469 --> 02:24:07.479 align:start position:0%
individuals that are always kind of
 
02:24:09.230 --> 02:24:09.240 align:start position:0%
looking for you know their own kind of
 
02:24:11.790 --> 02:24:11.800 align:start position:0%
time in the woods Alone um it's
 
02:24:14.030 --> 02:24:14.040 align:start position:0%
difficult to accommodate all those um so
 
02:24:15.790 --> 02:24:15.800 align:start position:0%
so what we tend to do is we allow
 
02:24:17.990 --> 02:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
certain weapons in in different existing
 
02:24:19.630 --> 02:24:19.640 align:start position:0%
Seasons because you just can't parse it
 
02:24:22.309 --> 02:24:22.319 align:start position:0%
all out um so this would likely be an
 
02:24:23.950 --> 02:24:23.960 align:start position:0%
allowable weapon during our existing
 
02:24:25.710 --> 02:24:25.720 align:start position:0%
firearm season that you could use with
 
02:24:28.950 --> 02:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
your um with your regular um hunting
 
02:24:34.269 --> 02:24:34.279 align:start position:0%
license F followup followup thank you um
 
02:24:36.950 --> 02:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
thank you um I guess to what I was
 
02:24:38.389 --> 02:24:38.399 align:start position:0%
trying to get at
 
02:24:41.710 --> 02:24:41.720 align:start position:0%
was you would have to purchase I'm
 
02:24:44.630 --> 02:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
assuming a different kind of um hunting
 
02:24:46.990 --> 02:24:47.000 align:start position:0%
license you know you you purchase a
 
02:24:48.830 --> 02:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
hunting license for muzzle loaders and
 
02:24:52.309 --> 02:24:52.319 align:start position:0%
so forth so would you purchase a hunting
 
02:24:54.630 --> 02:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
license that allows you to hunt with air
 
02:24:57.349 --> 02:24:57.359 align:start position:0%
rifles so would this be another uh
 
02:25:01.230 --> 02:25:01.240 align:start position:0%
Revenue source for fishing game um you
 
02:25:03.349 --> 02:25:03.359 align:start position:0%
you could set up a separate license I
 
02:25:04.870 --> 02:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
think our initial thought would be that
 
02:25:06.630 --> 02:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't do that this would just be a
 
02:25:08.469 --> 02:25:08.479 align:start position:0%
an allowable weapon within an existing
 
02:25:10.590 --> 02:25:10.600 align:start position:0%
season so for example um you know you
 
02:25:12.910 --> 02:25:12.920 align:start position:0%
can use
 
02:25:16.830 --> 02:25:16.840 align:start position:0%
um you could use a an a bow and arrow
 
02:25:18.510 --> 02:25:18.520 align:start position:0%
during the firearm season you can use a
 
02:25:20.790 --> 02:25:20.800 align:start position:0%
crossbow during the firearm season um
 
02:25:22.309 --> 02:25:22.319 align:start position:0%
this would now allow the for the use of
 
02:25:24.190 --> 02:25:24.200 align:start position:0%
an air rifle during the during the
 
02:25:26.230 --> 02:25:26.240 align:start position:0%
firearm season you can use a you can use
 
02:25:27.590 --> 02:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
a bow and arrow during the firearm
 
02:25:29.389 --> 02:25:29.399 align:start position:0%
season without having to buy an archery
 
02:25:31.830 --> 02:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
license you're using your existing
 
02:25:33.550 --> 02:25:33.560 align:start position:0%
regular hunting license in the tag
 
02:25:35.510 --> 02:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
associated with it um if you want to
 
02:25:37.510 --> 02:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
hunt during the archery season the
 
02:25:38.830 --> 02:25:38.840 align:start position:0%
difference there is that allows you
 
02:25:40.670 --> 02:25:40.680 align:start position:0%
extended an extended period of time to
 
02:25:42.950 --> 02:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
hunt um but if an individual was fine
 
02:25:44.349 --> 02:25:44.359 align:start position:0%
with the length of the firearm season
 
02:25:46.550 --> 02:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
and wanted to and chose to use a bow and
 
02:25:47.950 --> 02:25:47.960 align:start position:0%
arrow during the firearm season they
 
02:25:50.349 --> 02:25:50.359 align:start position:0%
could they could do that I see okay
 
02:25:50.359 --> 02:25:51.950 align:start position:0%
could they could do that I see okay
thank

02:25:51.950 --> 02:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:25:54.469 --> 02:25:54.479 align:start position:0%
you any other
 
02:25:57.630 --> 02:25:57.640 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
02:26:01.070 --> 02:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
Stone what is the what is the the foot
 
02:26:04.550 --> 02:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
pound the Velocity in the uh of the of
 
02:26:08.469 --> 02:26:08.479 align:start position:0%
the round the Grain in the grain bullet
 
02:26:11.230 --> 02:26:11.240 align:start position:0%
yeah um I don't know offand so our our
 
02:26:13.110 --> 02:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
species biologists are kind of looking
 
02:26:15.630 --> 02:26:15.640 align:start position:0%
into what they what what seems most
 
02:26:18.429 --> 02:26:18.439 align:start position:0%
appropriate um and foot pounds yeah so
 
02:26:20.630 --> 02:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
for foot pounds what we've what we seen
 
02:26:22.750 --> 02:26:22.760 align:start position:0%
so far is that it tends to be about 400
 
02:26:25.550 --> 02:26:25.560 align:start position:0%
foot PBS for deer and bear and about 600
 
02:26:27.870 --> 02:26:27.880 align:start position:0%
foot PBS for a moose basically the same
 
02:26:30.870 --> 02:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
foot pound of 9 mm or 40 40 Spence of
 
02:26:34.150 --> 02:26:34.160 align:start position:0%
Western yes that's about what it is I
 
02:26:36.070 --> 02:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
was a scout sniper in the Marine Corps
 
02:26:38.110 --> 02:26:38.120 align:start position:0%
and uh I just want to make sure they can
 
02:26:40.630 --> 02:26:40.640 align:start position:0%
take it down they shoot it once should
 
02:26:42.870 --> 02:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
it don't go down you know just to stand
 
02:26:45.389 --> 02:26:45.399 align:start position:0%
there and keep on shooting it's I don't
 
02:26:47.429 --> 02:26:47.439 align:start position:0%
I don't go for that no absolutely and
 
02:26:49.030 --> 02:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
and you know we teach that in our hunter
 
02:26:51.429 --> 02:26:51.439 align:start position:0%
Ed courses um you know the the most
 
02:26:52.950 --> 02:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
important thing is taking an ethical
 
02:26:55.230 --> 02:26:55.240 align:start position:0%
shot on that animal um you know you make
 
02:26:57.710 --> 02:26:57.720 align:start position:0%
sure of what your target is that you can
 
02:26:59.150 --> 02:26:59.160 align:start position:0%
take a good shot that you're not going
 
02:27:00.670 --> 02:27:00.680 align:start position:0%
to have concerns about missing that you
 
02:27:04.590 --> 02:27:04.600 align:start position:0%
recover that animal um we'll likely um I
 
02:27:05.910 --> 02:27:05.920 align:start position:0%
would assume we'll likely put out some
 
02:27:08.269 --> 02:27:08.279 align:start position:0%
educational material about these about
 
02:27:10.550 --> 02:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
these weapons being a new weapon um to
 
02:27:13.870 --> 02:27:13.880 align:start position:0%
the public um we may um and like I'd
 
02:27:15.230 --> 02:27:15.240 align:start position:0%
have to talk to our public affairs
 
02:27:17.030 --> 02:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
division but I would foresee us um
 
02:27:18.590 --> 02:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
folding some information into our hunter
 
02:27:20.750 --> 02:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
Ed courses about these these weapons as
 
02:27:23.990 --> 02:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
well um but yes absolutely and and those
 
02:27:26.750 --> 02:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
those um those viewpoints are already
 
02:27:28.790 --> 02:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
taught in our hunter Ed Course what
 
02:27:30.150 --> 02:27:30.160 align:start position:0%
about age
 
02:27:34.269 --> 02:27:34.279 align:start position:0%
group kids you want these things the age
 
02:27:37.110 --> 02:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:42.630 --> 02:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:45.070 --> 02:27:45.080 align:start position:0%
followup if you like to have a followup
 
02:27:47.590 --> 02:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
question you have to yeah recognize by
 
02:27:49.790 --> 02:27:49.800 align:start position:0%
the chair to have a follow-up question
 
02:27:51.030 --> 02:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:27:53.349 --> 02:27:53.359 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
02:27:55.910 --> 02:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
yeah so you're you're asking whether or
 
02:27:58.990 --> 02:27:59.000 align:start position:0%
not youth would be able to a great age
 
02:28:01.830 --> 02:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
age limit the age limit on these weap
 
02:28:04.950 --> 02:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
these you know young teenagers and yeah
 
02:28:06.510 --> 02:28:06.520 align:start position:0%
it would be the same as all of our other
 
02:28:08.070 --> 02:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
weapons all right yeah so it doesn't
 
02:28:10.870 --> 02:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
matter okay y I thank you
 
02:28:13.070 --> 02:28:13.080 align:start position:0%

02:28:33.429 --> 02:28:33.439 align:start position:0%
lines to read and you know for me to
 
02:28:35.070 --> 02:28:35.080 align:start position:0%
understand but for the record I want to
 
02:28:38.309 --> 02:28:38.319 align:start position:0%
ask you all these things are written is
 
02:28:38.319 --> 02:28:39.550 align:start position:0%
ask you all these things are written is
there

02:28:39.550 --> 02:28:39.560 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:28:39.560 --> 02:28:41.070 align:start position:0%
there
anywhere

02:28:41.070 --> 02:28:41.080 align:start position:0%
anywhere
 
02:28:45.030 --> 02:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
um stop the gun rights for any manner or
 
02:28:49.030 --> 02:28:49.040 align:start position:0%
shape um so I I'm kind of going off the
 
02:28:51.309 --> 02:28:51.319 align:start position:0%
amended version um that's that's what
 
02:28:53.190 --> 02:28:53.200 align:start position:0%
the department is support of I I don't
 
02:28:54.950 --> 02:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
see anything within the amended version
 
02:28:57.190 --> 02:28:57.200 align:start position:0%
of the bill that that would reduce gun
 
02:28:59.389 --> 02:28:59.399 align:start position:0%
rights for anyone um if anything this is
 
02:29:01.389 --> 02:29:01.399 align:start position:0%
allowing an additional um I mean it's
 
02:29:03.910 --> 02:29:03.920 align:start position:0%
not a firearm under the definition but
 
02:29:06.070 --> 02:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
um this is an allowance of an additional
 
02:29:08.110 --> 02:29:08.120 align:start position:0%
weapon to to hunt with so I I don't see
 
02:29:10.830 --> 02:29:10.840 align:start position:0%
anything in there thank
 
02:29:13.670 --> 02:29:13.680 align:start position:0%
you any other
 
02:29:15.950 --> 02:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr Bon thank you
 
02:29:15.960 --> 02:29:18.429 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr Bon thank you
very

02:29:18.429 --> 02:29:18.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:20.670 --> 02:29:20.680 align:start position:0%
much um
 
02:29:20.680 --> 02:29:27.710 align:start position:0%
much um
Colonel

02:29:27.710 --> 02:29:27.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:30.110 --> 02:29:30.120 align:start position:0%
Jordan orig good morning again
 
02:29:31.990 --> 02:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
originally I wasn't going to testify uh
 
02:29:33.590 --> 02:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
Dan was going to do that but because of
 
02:29:35.110 --> 02:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
the law enforcement questions I wanted
 
02:29:38.389 --> 02:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
to so the question regarding um first of
 
02:29:39.870 --> 02:29:39.880 align:start position:0%
all I want to tell you that we were we
 
02:29:41.190 --> 02:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
were not in favor of this in the
 
02:29:43.030 --> 02:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
beginning until we went to the range and
 
02:29:44.830 --> 02:29:44.840 align:start position:0%
actually saw these demonstrated to us
 
02:29:47.590 --> 02:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
we're confident uh that these guys have
 
02:29:50.030 --> 02:29:50.040 align:start position:0%
done their homework and we're we're not
 
02:29:51.190 --> 02:29:51.200 align:start position:0%
producing something that's going to
 
02:29:53.830 --> 02:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
wound animals uh and lose them that's
 
02:29:56.750 --> 02:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
number one number two I think currently
 
02:29:59.630 --> 02:29:59.640 align:start position:0%
the technology is fairly expensive uh
 
02:30:01.670 --> 02:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
and I think I think the prime sponsor
 
02:30:03.469 --> 02:30:03.479 align:start position:0%
would agree someone who uses one of
 
02:30:05.510 --> 02:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
these guns is going to have some going
 
02:30:07.309 --> 02:30:07.319 align:start position:0%
to have to it's going to require some
 
02:30:09.150 --> 02:30:09.160 align:start position:0%
knowledge about how to use it working
 
02:30:11.910 --> 02:30:11.920 align:start position:0%
with compressed air and the like so I'm
 
02:30:13.750 --> 02:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
not concerned that it's going to go wide
 
02:30:16.469 --> 02:30:16.479 align:start position:0%
to the public in the first year it'll
 
02:30:18.510 --> 02:30:18.520 align:start position:0%
just offer an opportunity for another
 
02:30:21.510 --> 02:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
method there are advantages to it that I
 
02:30:24.269 --> 02:30:24.279 align:start position:0%
see and and I'm basing that on on what I
 
02:30:28.110 --> 02:30:28.120 align:start position:0%
get for calls so using it down in a in a
 
02:30:32.429 --> 02:30:32.439 align:start position:0%
um you know a more um populated area
 
02:30:33.670 --> 02:30:33.680 align:start position:0%
like we have in the southern part of the
 
02:30:35.190 --> 02:30:35.200 align:start position:0%
state I think it'd be better than a
 
02:30:37.950 --> 02:30:37.960 align:start position:0%
rifle uh it will have less noise it will
 
02:30:40.790 --> 02:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
be while they are dangerous I don't
 
02:30:42.830 --> 02:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
think they're they're as dangerous as
 
02:30:44.670 --> 02:30:44.680 align:start position:0%
discharging a 30 yard six within the
 
02:30:46.910 --> 02:30:46.920 align:start position:0%
city limits are conquered these would be
 
02:30:48.550 --> 02:30:48.560 align:start position:0%
safer for that so I think that would be
 
02:30:52.389 --> 02:30:52.399 align:start position:0%
an advantage um um And in regards U
 
02:30:54.630 --> 02:30:54.640 align:start position:0%
representative Harvey for the license so
 
02:30:57.990 --> 02:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
the licenses you point out muzzle loader
 
02:30:59.950 --> 02:30:59.960 align:start position:0%
bow and arrow anything that offers
 
02:31:02.389 --> 02:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
additional time to hunt a certain
 
02:31:04.990 --> 02:31:05.000 align:start position:0%
species we normally get a license and
 
02:31:07.190 --> 02:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
we're and so to start with this we're
 
02:31:08.750 --> 02:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
going to put it out during the regular
 
02:31:12.150 --> 02:31:12.160 align:start position:0%
deer season I will say this that the uh
 
02:31:13.950 --> 02:31:13.960 align:start position:0%
the writers of this bill representative
 
02:31:16.230 --> 02:31:16.240 align:start position:0%
Spain representative Cole were pretty
 
02:31:18.070 --> 02:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
careful about how they did this and we
 
02:31:20.230 --> 02:31:20.240 align:start position:0%
had a long discussion regarding Pitman
 
02:31:22.670 --> 02:31:22.680 align:start position:0%
Robert's money so Pitman Robert's money
 
02:31:24.389 --> 02:31:24.399 align:start position:0%
comes into the department based on
 
02:31:27.309 --> 02:31:27.319 align:start position:0%
Firearms tax and and ammunition these
 
02:31:29.110 --> 02:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
would not be would not meet that
 
02:31:31.230 --> 02:31:31.240 align:start position:0%
standard so they were concerned that we
 
02:31:34.429 --> 02:31:34.439 align:start position:0%
were losing uh possib possibly losing
 
02:31:36.750 --> 02:31:36.760 align:start position:0%
income so I believe they put the in the
 
02:31:39.110 --> 02:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
bill that we would have the authority
 
02:31:40.550 --> 02:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
the department would have the authority
 
02:31:44.750 --> 02:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
if we saw fit to uh write or or create a
 
02:31:47.870 --> 02:31:47.880 align:start position:0%
rule that would require a special air
 
02:31:51.309 --> 02:31:51.319 align:start position:0%
rifle tag if we Cho chose to do that we
 
02:31:52.950 --> 02:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
our plan is to kind of roll us out
 
02:31:56.070 --> 02:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
slowly to educate people uh like we do
 
02:31:57.429 --> 02:31:57.439 align:start position:0%
any of these things to make sure that
 
02:31:59.309 --> 02:31:59.319 align:start position:0%
they're on board with how to use it and
 
02:32:02.030 --> 02:32:02.040 align:start position:0%
then we'll review how many take take
 
02:32:04.429 --> 02:32:04.439 align:start position:0%
partake in it so the important thing to
 
02:32:06.830 --> 02:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
remember is if we by giving us the and
 
02:32:08.750 --> 02:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
this was a I want to thank the chairman
 
02:32:10.429 --> 02:32:10.439 align:start position:0%
for doing this giving us the opportunity
 
02:32:13.030 --> 02:32:13.040 align:start position:0%
to do this in rule also provides the
 
02:32:14.670 --> 02:32:14.680 align:start position:0%
general public with a couple of bites at
 
02:32:16.870 --> 02:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
the Apple to come in and learn about
 
02:32:18.790 --> 02:32:18.800 align:start position:0%
this and and give us their opinion
 
02:32:20.670 --> 02:32:20.680 align:start position:0%
because to get anything in rule you got
 
02:32:22.389 --> 02:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
to have public hearings and so that's
 
02:32:24.870 --> 02:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
going to give the The Hunting Community
 
02:32:26.550 --> 02:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
uh and any everybody for that matter an
 
02:32:27.870 --> 02:32:27.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity to come in to see what we're
 
02:32:29.990 --> 02:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
doing and why we're doing it so I think
 
02:32:31.710 --> 02:32:31.720 align:start position:0%
it's it's even a better way than doing
 
02:32:34.030 --> 02:32:34.040 align:start position:0%
it through um legislation it's going to
 
02:32:36.389 --> 02:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
give them a more a better opportunity as
 
02:32:38.590 --> 02:32:38.600 align:start position:0%
far as enforcement goes I don't see it
 
02:32:40.110 --> 02:32:40.120 align:start position:0%
being a whole I will have to educate
 
02:32:41.830 --> 02:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
some of my staff because I was educated
 
02:32:44.630 --> 02:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
when I went to the range um but the guns
 
02:32:46.309 --> 02:32:46.319 align:start position:0%
are very telling when you look at them
 
02:32:48.630 --> 02:32:48.640 align:start position:0%
and hold them uh The Operators will be
 
02:32:50.389 --> 02:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
able to tell us what they shooting with
 
02:32:52.309 --> 02:32:52.319 align:start position:0%
very much like we're doing now we have
 
02:32:54.269 --> 02:32:54.279 align:start position:0%
limitations on 22s we have certain
 
02:32:56.990 --> 02:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
limitations on calibers um some of the
 
02:32:58.790 --> 02:32:58.800 align:start position:0%
straight wall cartridge laws that have
 
02:33:00.550 --> 02:33:00.560 align:start position:0%
passed you know it it requires us to
 
02:33:03.110 --> 02:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
take that stuff in hand and look at it
 
02:33:06.150 --> 02:33:06.160 align:start position:0%
but but I I don't anticipate great
 
02:33:09.750 --> 02:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
challenges to that um again I think that
 
02:33:11.550 --> 02:33:11.560 align:start position:0%
first year would a first year or so
 
02:33:13.469 --> 02:33:13.479 align:start position:0%
would be a year of Education much like
 
02:33:15.950 --> 02:33:15.960 align:start position:0%
our cameras have been uh we've spent
 
02:33:17.870 --> 02:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
more time educating people than pinching
 
02:33:19.950 --> 02:33:19.960 align:start position:0%
them um because a lot of people
 
02:33:21.389 --> 02:33:21.399 align:start position:0%
violating the law they just don't
 
02:33:23.070 --> 02:33:23.080 align:start position:0%
understand it so we work to try and make
 
02:33:24.750 --> 02:33:24.760 align:start position:0%
them understand it and then we work to
 
02:33:26.990 --> 02:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
get the criminals later so the people
 
02:33:29.389 --> 02:33:29.399 align:start position:0%
that are intent on doing it so I I want
 
02:33:31.590 --> 02:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
to say I think it was well thought out I
 
02:33:33.510 --> 02:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate their patience we were not
 
02:33:36.349 --> 02:33:36.359 align:start position:0%
always easy to deal with um and and I
 
02:33:38.269 --> 02:33:38.279 align:start position:0%
appreciate them taking us to the range
 
02:33:39.670 --> 02:33:39.680 align:start position:0%
so we could actually shoot these things
 
02:33:42.030 --> 02:33:42.040 align:start position:0%
and see it I'm much more confident on
 
02:33:43.750 --> 02:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
their ability after watching it and
 
02:33:46.309 --> 02:33:46.319 align:start position:0%
talking with the manufacturers uh and I
 
02:33:47.830 --> 02:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
and I certainly appreciate
 
02:33:50.030 --> 02:33:50.040 align:start position:0%
representative Spain and representative
 
02:33:52.349 --> 02:33:52.359 align:start position:0%
willingness to let us do it in rule that
 
02:33:54.150 --> 02:33:54.160 align:start position:0%
will help us control it that will help
 
02:33:56.030 --> 02:33:56.040 align:start position:0%
us adjust for any problems that we might
 
02:33:58.030 --> 02:33:58.040 align:start position:0%
see and it'll give the public a better
 
02:34:01.309 --> 02:34:01.319 align:start position:0%
chance to voice their opinion so you
 
02:34:03.190 --> 02:34:03.200 align:start position:0%
were a pretty good shot with it too yeah
 
02:34:05.309 --> 02:34:05.319 align:start position:0%
it we did it we did all right there I
 
02:34:06.790 --> 02:34:06.800 align:start position:0%
will tell you the other thing that was a
 
02:34:08.550 --> 02:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
bit amazing to me representative Harvey
 
02:34:10.870 --> 02:34:10.880 align:start position:0%
is I was under the impression multiple
 
02:34:13.110 --> 02:34:13.120 align:start position:0%
shots I was concerned about a second
 
02:34:15.790 --> 02:34:15.800 align:start position:0%
shot you lose pressure I personally shot
 
02:34:18.309 --> 02:34:18.319 align:start position:0%
it three times at a very low loss of
 
02:34:22.870 --> 02:34:22.880 align:start position:0%
pressure and a very U minimal um
 
02:34:24.750 --> 02:34:24.760 align:start position:0%
variation on the Target no my I think my
 
02:34:27.510 --> 02:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
muzzle loader would do the same so I
 
02:34:29.190 --> 02:34:29.200 align:start position:0%
think if people are mindful of that like
 
02:34:30.469 --> 02:34:30.479 align:start position:0%
you have muzzle Loos I think they're
 
02:34:33.150 --> 02:34:33.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:35.349 --> 02:34:35.359 align:start position:0%
accurate representative
 
02:34:37.550 --> 02:34:37.560 align:start position:0%
Harvey thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
02:34:41.150 --> 02:34:41.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question yes ma'am so
 
02:34:44.830 --> 02:34:44.840 align:start position:0%
um we heard testimony from the sponsor
 
02:34:48.510 --> 02:34:48.520 align:start position:0%
that it seems to be manufacturers are
 
02:34:48.520 --> 02:34:50.269 align:start position:0%
that it seems to be manufacturers are
not

02:34:50.269 --> 02:34:50.279 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:34:52.110 --> 02:34:52.120 align:start position:0%
I don't want to say consistent but there
 
02:34:54.469 --> 02:34:54.479 align:start position:0%
there's differences in different kinds
 
02:34:56.670 --> 02:34:56.680 align:start position:0%
of air rifles some
 
02:34:58.910 --> 02:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
allow regulation and some you have to
 
02:35:01.150 --> 02:35:01.160 align:start position:0%
count how many times you've shot and so
 
02:35:03.670 --> 02:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
forth since there's differences in the
 
02:35:06.230 --> 02:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
manufacturing of these air rifles is
 
02:35:09.349 --> 02:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
that going to cause any problem in uh
 
02:35:11.309 --> 02:35:11.319 align:start position:0%
law enforcement in the beginning it'll
 
02:35:13.070 --> 02:35:13.080 align:start position:0%
be a challenge to make sure that we're
 
02:35:14.790 --> 02:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
all Ed we're going to be educated on
 
02:35:16.630 --> 02:35:16.640 align:start position:0%
them and I have a plan for that to get
 
02:35:20.150 --> 02:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
them educated um I don't but mu loaders
 
02:35:21.910 --> 02:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
do that now so there's a big difference
 
02:35:23.429 --> 02:35:23.439 align:start position:0%
between an inline muzzle loader a break
 
02:35:25.550 --> 02:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
open muzzle loader and a and a Thompson
 
02:35:27.910 --> 02:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
Center a regular muzzle loader so that
 
02:35:29.469 --> 02:35:29.479 align:start position:0%
was a bit of a learning curve for some
 
02:35:31.070 --> 02:35:31.080 align:start position:0%
of the some of the some of my officers
 
02:35:33.030 --> 02:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
that didn't hunt prior to getting this
 
02:35:35.269 --> 02:35:35.279 align:start position:0%
job so we spent time with them so they
 
02:35:37.230 --> 02:35:37.240 align:start position:0%
could see that and once I think once we
 
02:35:39.309 --> 02:35:39.319 align:start position:0%
get them educated I I don't I don't
 
02:35:41.469 --> 02:35:41.479 align:start position:0%
anticipate a great deal of problems
 
02:35:43.469 --> 02:35:43.479 align:start position:0%
frankly I might be surprised but I don't
 
02:35:45.510 --> 02:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
know how many people will use it because
 
02:35:47.469 --> 02:35:47.479 align:start position:0%
it is a bit cumbersome with the tank I
 
02:35:50.389 --> 02:35:50.399 align:start position:0%
think as technology advances um more
 
02:35:52.750 --> 02:35:52.760 align:start position:0%
people become ready to use it but I but
 
02:35:55.389 --> 02:35:55.399 align:start position:0%
I think it'll it'll I don't see a danger
 
02:35:57.030 --> 02:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
to the wildlife that's important to me
 
02:35:58.710 --> 02:35:58.720 align:start position:0%
personally I don't see a danger to that
 
02:36:00.590 --> 02:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
I don't see a safety danger I think they
 
02:36:02.389 --> 02:36:02.399 align:start position:0%
could be shot and handled safely with
 
02:36:04.830 --> 02:36:04.840 align:start position:0%
some education uh and I think we'll be
 
02:36:06.309 --> 02:36:06.319 align:start position:0%
able I'm confident we'll be able to
 
02:36:07.990 --> 02:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
enforce it so I think it's been well
 
02:36:11.070 --> 02:36:11.080 align:start position:0%
thought out um and I I think we're ready
 
02:36:16.269 --> 02:36:16.279 align:start position:0%
for that followup please followup um and
 
02:36:18.510 --> 02:36:18.520 align:start position:0%
and you just said and I hadn't thought
 
02:36:21.150 --> 02:36:21.160 align:start position:0%
of that um Pitman Roberts won't apply to
 
02:36:23.830 --> 02:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
this because no right but you feel that
 
02:36:26.269 --> 02:36:26.279 align:start position:0%
there's something in this bill that will
 
02:36:31.670 --> 02:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
allow fishing game to um collect POS at
 
02:36:33.510 --> 02:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
some point to possibly collect money
 
02:36:36.590 --> 02:36:36.600 align:start position:0%
from from the tanks itself I guess I I
 
02:36:39.990 --> 02:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
didn't see no I I I misspoke tag so what
 
02:36:41.750 --> 02:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
what represent we talked about that at
 
02:36:44.349 --> 02:36:44.359 align:start position:0%
the range that day that this would uh
 
02:36:47.469 --> 02:36:47.479 align:start position:0%
exempt the income from Pitman Roberts
 
02:36:49.590 --> 02:36:49.600 align:start position:0%
and he put in the bill he gave us the
 
02:36:52.150 --> 02:36:52.160 align:start position:0%
Authority in the bill to write special
 
02:36:56.469 --> 02:36:56.479 align:start position:0%
roles to create a tag a a air tag was my
 
02:36:58.990 --> 02:36:59.000 align:start position:0%
understanding if you look at page two
 
02:37:02.349 --> 02:37:02.359 align:start position:0%
line 29 we added the executive director
 
02:37:04.670 --> 02:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
May further adopt rules pursuant to RSA
 
02:37:07.309 --> 02:37:07.319 align:start position:0%
541a to create issue and cell tag
 
02:37:09.190 --> 02:37:09.200 align:start position:0%
specifically for hunting with an air
 
02:37:14.349 --> 02:37:14.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:16.910 --> 02:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
tag any other
 
02:37:19.070 --> 02:37:19.080 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much thank you
 
02:37:19.080 --> 02:37:25.190 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much thank you

02:37:27.870 --> 02:37:27.880 align:start position:0%
with no other uh people for Testimony
 
02:37:33.389 --> 02:37:33.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:43.910 --> 02:37:43.920 align:start position:0%

02:37:53.950 --> 02:37:53.960 align:start position:0%
I will now open the hearing on HB 61
 
02:37:55.510 --> 02:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
creating a committee to study laws
 
02:38:00.110 --> 02:38:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:04.030 --> 02:38:04.040 align:start position:0%
harvesting I do not have any
 
02:38:04.040 --> 02:38:15.910 align:start position:0%
harvesting I do not have any
cards

02:38:15.910 --> 02:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:23.870 --> 02:38:23.880 align:start position:0%

02:38:53.990 --> 02:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes rep anber the prime
 
02:38:56.070 --> 02:38:56.080 align:start position:0%

02:38:57.830 --> 02:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
right thank you Mr chairman and members
 
02:38:58.870 --> 02:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Aiden

anenberg I represent straford 7 which is
 
02:39:02.030 --> 02:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
the city of
 
02:39:04.030 --> 02:39:04.040 align:start position:0%
Rochester I'm here to introduce House
 
02:39:06.550 --> 02:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
Bill 61 which is uh forming a study
 
02:39:10.190 --> 02:39:10.200 align:start position:0%
committee to exp um to um look at the
 
02:39:13.190 --> 02:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
laws um regarding commercial harvesting
 
02:39:16.150 --> 02:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
of oysters in New Hampshire um and the
 
02:39:17.790 --> 02:39:17.800 align:start position:0%
important part in there in the duties in
 
02:39:19.990 --> 02:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
the bill is um expanding purpose of
 
02:39:23.710 --> 02:39:23.720 align:start position:0%
expanding the industry um so this is
 
02:39:26.710 --> 02:39:26.720 align:start position:0%
actually the fastest growing um
 
02:39:28.750 --> 02:39:28.760 align:start position:0%
shellfish product and fishery in the
 
02:39:32.870 --> 02:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
state um started about 10 years ago
 
02:39:34.150 --> 02:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
where the commercial Harvest really
 
02:39:36.230 --> 02:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
started growing and now it's it's it's
 
02:39:37.550 --> 02:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
we're over like a
 
02:39:40.309 --> 02:39:40.319 align:start position:0%
th% um over like previous harvests and
 
02:39:43.710 --> 02:39:43.720 align:start position:0%
things so um you know there are a number
 
02:39:46.710 --> 02:39:46.720 align:start position:0%
of issues related to um oyster
 
02:39:50.030 --> 02:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
harvesting right now and that um there's
 
02:39:53.790 --> 02:39:53.800 align:start position:0%
95 Acres U between Little Bay Great Bay
 
02:39:56.630 --> 02:39:56.640 align:start position:0%
and Hampton Harbor that are actively um
 
02:40:00.910 --> 02:40:00.920 align:start position:0%
licensed for oyster farming um UNH did a
 
02:40:03.389 --> 02:40:03.399 align:start position:0%
study a number of years ago um that
 
02:40:06.110 --> 02:40:06.120 align:start position:0%
there was potentially up to 400 Acres so
 
02:40:10.950 --> 02:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
we're um available to be um leas um for
 
02:40:15.070 --> 02:40:15.080 align:start position:0%
o commercial oyster um farming so we are
 
02:40:17.110 --> 02:40:17.120 align:start position:0%
a little under a quarter of our Max
 
02:40:18.990 --> 02:40:19.000 align:start position:0%
Capacity there and we need to make sure
 
02:40:21.030 --> 02:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
that the the you know the state is doing
 
02:40:24.190 --> 02:40:24.200 align:start position:0%
its part to create the environment by
 
02:40:26.110 --> 02:40:26.120 align:start position:0%
which you know the industry can expand
 
02:40:28.950 --> 02:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
up to potentially that 400 acres and
 
02:40:30.950 --> 02:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
that we are looking at all sort of
 
02:40:34.830 --> 02:40:34.840 align:start position:0%
relevant um factors in terms of that
 
02:40:36.429 --> 02:40:36.439 align:start position:0%
while that industry grows that we're
 
02:40:39.630 --> 02:40:39.640 align:start position:0%
able to one you know test the oysters to
 
02:40:42.070 --> 02:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
bring them to Market safely uh provide
 
02:40:45.670 --> 02:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
access especially in Little Bay um where
 
02:40:47.590 --> 02:40:47.600 align:start position:0%
it's difficult for the the farmers to
 
02:40:50.389 --> 02:40:50.399 align:start position:0%
get into the bay um um you know a number
 
02:40:52.309 --> 02:40:52.319 align:start position:0%
of different issues um enforcement of
 
02:40:52.319 --> 02:40:53.349 align:start position:0%
of different issues um enforcement of
poaching

02:40:53.349 --> 02:40:53.359 align:start position:0%
poaching
 
02:40:55.790 --> 02:40:55.800 align:start position:0%
regulations um you know when we have
 
02:40:58.550 --> 02:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
these um when when the oysters are
 
02:41:01.110 --> 02:41:01.120 align:start position:0%
growing underwater as they are now um
 
02:41:03.590 --> 02:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
there's not a lot of um enforcement the
 
02:41:04.910 --> 02:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
people looking at the actual water to
 
02:41:06.150 --> 02:41:06.160 align:start position:0%
make sure people aren't going out there
 
02:41:08.469 --> 02:41:08.479 align:start position:0%
and opening opening these things and and
 
02:41:11.750 --> 02:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
taking them out of there so um there's a
 
02:41:14.630 --> 02:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
huge range of issues with with um oyster
 
02:41:16.510 --> 02:41:16.520 align:start position:0%
farming that we can look at um that's
 
02:41:19.750 --> 02:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
kind of what I'm seeking to do here um
 
02:41:21.630 --> 02:41:21.640 align:start position:0%
kind of comprehensively look at all of
 
02:41:24.590 --> 02:41:24.600 align:start position:0%
these different issues solicit testimony
 
02:41:26.670 --> 02:41:26.680 align:start position:0%
um from the farming from the farmers
 
02:41:29.550 --> 02:41:29.560 align:start position:0%
themselves the department the public um
 
02:41:32.230 --> 02:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
there there has been some talk um of
 
02:41:35.309 --> 02:41:35.319 align:start position:0%
property rights issues with um abutters
 
02:41:38.510 --> 02:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
to the waterways um if they were to use
 
02:41:42.630 --> 02:41:42.640 align:start position:0%
um top water gear um so in terms of like
 
02:41:44.790 --> 02:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
the the view um so there there's a
 
02:41:46.230 --> 02:41:46.240 align:start position:0%
number of issues and really what we want
 
02:41:48.510 --> 02:41:48.520 align:start position:0%
to do is look at all of these different
 
02:41:51.510 --> 02:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
issues take testimony on them and then
 
02:41:53.550 --> 02:41:53.560 align:start position:0%
come back to um the committee with
 
02:41:53.560 --> 02:41:54.550 align:start position:0%
come back to um the committee with
immediate

02:41:54.550 --> 02:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
immediate
 
02:41:56.670 --> 02:41:56.680 align:start position:0%
recommendations um sort of intermediate
 
02:41:58.550 --> 02:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
so like years out any type of
 
02:41:59.990 --> 02:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
Appropriations that would need to be
 
02:42:02.750 --> 02:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
made um we' be looking at uh making
 
02:42:04.269 --> 02:42:04.279 align:start position:0%
those recommendations so it' be
 
02:42:06.750 --> 02:42:06.760 align:start position:0%
immediate um sort of intermediate and
 
02:42:08.070 --> 02:42:08.080 align:start position:0%
it's kind of
 
02:42:10.190 --> 02:42:10.200 align:start position:0%
long-term uh recommendations that we
 
02:42:12.030 --> 02:42:12.040 align:start position:0%
could make to you folks so we can do the
 
02:42:13.750 --> 02:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
the difficult work of looking into these
 
02:42:15.429 --> 02:42:15.439 align:start position:0%
issues and then so when we come back to
 
02:42:18.790 --> 02:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
you you know your next year and in your
 
02:42:21.150 --> 02:42:21.160 align:start position:0%
previous and U following by anms that
 
02:42:22.550 --> 02:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
you you can have some confidence that
 
02:42:24.830 --> 02:42:24.840 align:start position:0%
we've looked into these issues um
 
02:42:27.230 --> 02:42:27.240 align:start position:0%
solicited the testimony and then we're
 
02:42:29.110 --> 02:42:29.120 align:start position:0%
giving you accurate recommendations as
 
02:42:31.269 --> 02:42:31.279 align:start position:0%
to how to move forward so that's what I
 
02:42:33.990 --> 02:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
would be asking you today is that um you
 
02:42:36.630 --> 02:42:36.640 align:start position:0%
that you would support this um so that
 
02:42:39.469 --> 02:42:39.479 align:start position:0%
we can look into helping the the oyster
 
02:42:42.230 --> 02:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
farmers of New Hampshire um and as the
 
02:42:44.150 --> 02:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
industry grows that we're kind of
 
02:42:45.870 --> 02:42:45.880 align:start position:0%
covering all of our
 
02:42:50.630 --> 02:42:50.640 align:start position:0%
bases thank you are there any questions
 
02:42:52.590 --> 02:42:52.600 align:start position:0%
represent Smith thank you Mr chairman
 
02:42:54.550 --> 02:42:54.560 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question Who
 
02:42:57.429 --> 02:42:57.439 align:start position:0%
currently sets the season and area of
 
02:42:58.830 --> 02:42:58.840 align:start position:0%
harvest right
 
02:43:02.190 --> 02:43:02.200 align:start position:0%
now so that that would be the
 
02:43:04.550 --> 02:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
department official game department okay
 
02:43:07.230 --> 02:43:07.240 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up so it's done
 
02:43:10.790 --> 02:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
currently through the rules process for
 
02:43:12.910 --> 02:43:12.920 align:start position:0%
them well I imagine it would be through
 
02:43:17.309 --> 02:43:17.319 align:start position:0%
that yes follow up follow up if there's
 
02:43:19.269 --> 02:43:19.279 align:start position:0%
such a need for this why haven't they
 
02:43:21.150 --> 02:43:21.160 align:start position:0%
explored expanding it
 
02:43:24.349 --> 02:43:24.359 align:start position:0%
currently so I'm I'm not so much well
 
02:43:27.150 --> 02:43:27.160 align:start position:0%
the that's just the 95 Acres that I was
 
02:43:29.550 --> 02:43:29.560 align:start position:0%
talking about is what's currently um
 
02:43:32.070 --> 02:43:32.080 align:start position:0%
licensed in New Hampshire there like I
 
02:43:34.030 --> 02:43:34.040 align:start position:0%
said it UNH has said that there is
 
02:43:37.110 --> 02:43:37.120 align:start position:0%
potential potential for up to 400 Acres
 
02:43:39.110 --> 02:43:39.120 align:start position:0%
so I I couldn't speak to why we haven't
 
02:43:40.630 --> 02:43:40.640 align:start position:0%
got to that point but I'll say like the
 
02:43:43.230 --> 02:43:43.240 align:start position:0%
industry has been growing we have 12
 
02:43:46.429 --> 02:43:46.439 align:start position:0%
commercial Farmers now um and the the
 
02:43:51.389 --> 02:43:51.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:52.590 --> 02:43:52.600 align:start position:0%
any other
 
02:43:54.750 --> 02:43:54.760 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
02:43:58.710 --> 02:43:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:03.110 --> 02:44:03.120 align:start position:0%
committee chair will now call Melissa
 
02:44:14.030 --> 02:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:16.389 --> 02:44:16.399 align:start position:0%
clf hand them down and and they'll get
 
02:44:26.830 --> 02:44:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:27.870 --> 02:44:27.880 align:start position:0%
turn on your
 
02:44:30.790 --> 02:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
mic thank you so much thank you for
 
02:44:32.790 --> 02:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
giving me a few moments to express my
 
02:44:35.429 --> 02:44:35.439 align:start position:0%
support for House Bill 61 my name is
 
02:44:37.990 --> 02:44:38.000 align:start position:0%

New England and and in New
 
02:44:57.309 --> 02:44:57.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I know a few of you are
 
02:45:00.150 --> 02:45:00.160 align:start position:0%
from the Sea Coast region and probably
 
02:45:03.110 --> 02:45:03.120 align:start position:0%
have a great appreciation for how
 
02:45:07.190 --> 02:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
beautiful the waterways are um in the
 
02:45:09.630 --> 02:45:09.640 align:start position:0%
coastal part of New Hampshire there's
 
02:45:12.750 --> 02:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
some really nice paintings here if you
 
02:45:15.230 --> 02:45:15.240 align:start position:0%
need a reminder but uh the bottom line
 
02:45:17.469 --> 02:45:17.479 align:start position:0%
is that all is not well below the
 
02:45:19.750 --> 02:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
surface as much as our our region is
 
02:45:23.429 --> 02:45:23.439 align:start position:0%
quite beautiful um we've had Decades of
 
02:45:26.550 --> 02:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
growth in our communities increases in
 
02:45:28.590 --> 02:45:28.600 align:start position:0%
the amount of sewage and septic systems
 
02:45:31.070 --> 02:45:31.080 align:start position:0%
and land use changes that flush storm
 
02:45:34.030 --> 02:45:34.040 align:start position:0%
water into our waterways with every
 
02:45:36.469 --> 02:45:36.479 align:start position:0%
rain um many of our communities are
 
02:45:38.710 --> 02:45:38.720 align:start position:0%
working very hard under new federal
 
02:45:41.269 --> 02:45:41.279 align:start position:0%
permits and others uh other mechanisms
 
02:45:44.790 --> 02:45:44.800 align:start position:0%
to reduce the pollution um in invest in
 
02:45:44.800 --> 02:45:46.070 align:start position:0%
to reduce the pollution um in invest in
improved

02:45:46.070 --> 02:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
improved
 
02:45:48.190 --> 02:45:48.200 align:start position:0%
infrastructure uh better treat
 
02:45:51.070 --> 02:45:51.080 align:start position:0%
Wastewater and storm water but progress
 
02:45:52.710 --> 02:45:52.720 align:start position:0%
is slow and
 
02:45:55.830 --> 02:45:55.840 align:start position:0%
expensive meanwhile one of Nature's most
 
02:45:59.070 --> 02:45:59.080 align:start position:0%
effective clean water machines is hiding
 
02:46:01.630 --> 02:46:01.640 align:start position:0%
underwater um in the Great Bay
 
02:46:04.790 --> 02:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
Estuary um we we think that a couple of
 
02:46:06.830 --> 02:46:06.840 align:start position:0%
decades ago in the early 90s we had as
 
02:46:09.309 --> 02:46:09.319 align:start position:0%
many as 25 million
 
02:46:13.269 --> 02:46:13.279 align:start position:0%
oysters um in the Great Bay each oyster
 
02:46:16.030 --> 02:46:16.040 align:start position:0%
is capable of filtering 30 to 50 gallons
 
02:46:18.389 --> 02:46:18.399 align:start position:0%
of water every single day removing
 
02:46:21.030 --> 02:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
pollutants using algae in the water as a
 
02:46:24.349 --> 02:46:24.359 align:start position:0%
source of food for growth and when we
 
02:46:26.790 --> 02:46:26.800 align:start position:0%
had 25 million oysters in the Great Bay
 
02:46:30.110 --> 02:46:30.120 align:start position:0%
estor um we believe that those organisms
 
02:46:32.349 --> 02:46:32.359 align:start position:0%
could filter the entire volume of water
 
02:46:35.710 --> 02:46:35.720 align:start position:0%
in the entire estro every four days it's
 
02:46:39.070 --> 02:46:39.080 align:start position:0%
kind of a miracle you couldn't build a
 
02:46:41.030 --> 02:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
treatment system if you had billions of
 
02:46:44.429 --> 02:46:44.439 align:start position:0%
dollars that do what oysters do for
 
02:46:49.349 --> 02:46:49.359 align:start position:0%
free um so I'm a big proponent of all
 
02:46:50.710 --> 02:46:50.720 align:start position:0%
kinds of measures that are going to
 
02:46:53.190 --> 02:46:53.200 align:start position:0%
increase the population of oysters to
 
02:46:55.790 --> 02:46:55.800 align:start position:0%
rebuild back to the 25 million that we
 
02:46:57.550 --> 02:46:57.560 align:start position:0%
had we lost
 
02:47:00.550 --> 02:47:00.560 align:start position:0%
95% of our natural oysters in the
 
02:47:03.110 --> 02:47:03.120 align:start position:0%
Estuary in the 90s due to several
 
02:47:05.950 --> 02:47:05.960 align:start position:0%
diseases so that coupled with the loss
 
02:47:08.990 --> 02:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
of underwater Meadows of um seagrass are
 
02:47:10.550 --> 02:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
what really have put the Great Bay
 
02:47:12.950 --> 02:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
Estuary into a state of
 
02:47:15.469 --> 02:47:15.479 align:start position:0%
decline but one of the bright lights
 
02:47:17.309 --> 02:47:17.319 align:start position:0%
that we have seen in the past 10 years
 
02:47:19.110 --> 02:47:19.120 align:start position:0%
as we just heard is the growth of the
 
02:47:21.710 --> 02:47:21.720 align:start position:0%
oyster aquaculture industry in Little
 
02:47:24.910 --> 02:47:24.920 align:start position:0%
Bay um from just 10 years ago when we
 
02:47:27.469 --> 02:47:27.479 align:start position:0%
had a few pioneering uh Farmers we now
 
02:47:30.190 --> 02:47:30.200 align:start position:0%
have nearly 20 we've seen a tenfold
 
02:47:32.110 --> 02:47:32.120 align:start position:0%
increase in the number of oysters
 
02:47:35.790 --> 02:47:35.800 align:start position:0%
harvested in the um little Bay Region
 
02:47:37.269 --> 02:47:37.279 align:start position:0%
and while some of those Farms are still
 
02:47:40.309 --> 02:47:40.319 align:start position:0%
solo operators others have Farm managers
 
02:47:43.150 --> 02:47:43.160 align:start position:0%
and additional staff they provide jobs
 
02:47:45.830 --> 02:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
they provide healthy food they support
 
02:47:48.830 --> 02:47:48.840 align:start position:0%
our local economy and they really are
 
02:47:51.510 --> 02:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
clean water machines so oysters really
 
02:47:54.269 --> 02:47:54.279 align:start position:0%
are a triple win um and we should really
 
02:47:56.469 --> 02:47:56.479 align:start position:0%
be doing everything we can to increase
 
02:47:59.710 --> 02:47:59.720 align:start position:0%
this important industry in New Hampshire
 
02:48:01.510 --> 02:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
just two weeks ago The Nature
 
02:48:03.309 --> 02:48:03.319 align:start position:0%
Conservancy uh and the Great Bay
 
02:48:05.469 --> 02:48:05.479 align:start position:0%
National estaran research Reserve had a
 
02:48:08.110 --> 02:48:08.120 align:start position:0%
meeting um of about 30 or 40 people
 
02:48:10.309 --> 02:48:10.319 align:start position:0%
including Fish and Game Representatives
 
02:48:13.910 --> 02:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
UNH researchers clean uh clean water
 
02:48:16.990 --> 02:48:17.000 align:start position:0%
Advocates uh and many oyster Farmers to
 
02:48:18.870 --> 02:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
discuss the constraints and opportun
 
02:48:21.150 --> 02:48:21.160 align:start position:0%
ities um to increasing the oyster
 
02:48:23.590 --> 02:48:23.600 align:start position:0%
aquaculture industry and there were many
 
02:48:26.950 --> 02:48:26.960 align:start position:0%
topics raised as again noted um problems
 
02:48:29.309 --> 02:48:29.319 align:start position:0%
with the current permitting process uh
 
02:48:32.429 --> 02:48:32.439 align:start position:0%
constraints on access points for people
 
02:48:34.309 --> 02:48:34.319 align:start position:0%
that need to be out on the water every
 
02:48:37.349 --> 02:48:37.359 align:start position:0%
day to tend their farms uh more
 
02:48:40.070 --> 02:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
education uh to help people especially
 
02:48:41.830 --> 02:48:41.840 align:start position:0%
uh AB buding land owners to understand
 
02:48:45.150 --> 02:48:45.160 align:start position:0%
the terrific value of aquaculture to
 
02:48:47.750 --> 02:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
increasing the health um of our
 
02:48:51.150 --> 02:48:51.160 align:start position:0%
waterways and the many economic benefits
 
02:48:53.389 --> 02:48:53.399 align:start position:0%
that this industry provides so these are
 
02:48:55.429 --> 02:48:55.439 align:start position:0%
the many reasons why I'm really pleased
 
02:48:58.269 --> 02:48:58.279 align:start position:0%
to see um this bill come forward and I
 
02:49:02.349 --> 02:49:02.359 align:start position:0%
hope that you'll support uh HB 61 um and
 
02:49:04.429 --> 02:49:04.439 align:start position:0%
as we move ahead in the years to come
 
02:49:07.630 --> 02:49:07.640 align:start position:0%
we'll see this this industry um really
 
02:49:10.429 --> 02:49:10.439 align:start position:0%
continue to grow uh I'd be happy to take
 
02:49:12.790 --> 02:49:12.800 align:start position:0%
any questions and thank you for giving a
 
02:49:16.670 --> 02:49:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:18.870 --> 02:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
questions okay seeing none thank you so

support uh aquaculture of oysters um we
 
02:50:09.110 --> 02:50:09.120 align:start position:0%
agree with much of what um the Great Bay
 
02:50:11.110 --> 02:50:11.120 align:start position:0%
Water keeper just testified to so I
 
02:50:13.910 --> 02:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
won't be repetitive um I do have a
 
02:50:16.670 --> 02:50:16.680 align:start position:0%
colleague who is an expert in this area
 
02:50:18.790 --> 02:50:18.800 align:start position:0%
and and runs the programs that we have
 
02:50:21.389 --> 02:50:21.399 align:start position:0%
she was not able to be with us today but
 
02:50:23.790 --> 02:50:23.800 align:start position:0%
um she would be certainly available to
 
02:50:25.790 --> 02:50:25.800 align:start position:0%
the study committee if you proceed with
 
02:50:27.910 --> 02:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
this bill so that we could share our
 
02:50:32.710 --> 02:50:32.720 align:start position:0%
experience um our resources um and
 
02:50:34.510 --> 02:50:34.520 align:start position:0%
collect information that's helpful to
 
02:50:36.670 --> 02:50:36.680 align:start position:0%
the study committee if it were to be put
 
02:50:39.030 --> 02:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
into place and I'd be happy to take any
 
02:50:42.469 --> 02:50:42.479 align:start position:0%
questions thank you are there any

questions seeing none thank you for your
 
02:50:44.600 --> 02:50:46.830 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your

initiative thank you so much for your
 
02:51:03.070 --> 02:51:03.080 align:start position:0%
time today I am Steven jenso here
 
02:51:05.110 --> 02:51:05.120 align:start position:0%
representing the oyster farmers of New
 
02:51:06.469 --> 02:51:06.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the shellfish Farmers
 
02:51:08.469 --> 02:51:08.479 align:start position:0%
initiative and I'm here to express our
 
02:51:11.469 --> 02:51:11.479 align:start position:0%
full support for hp61 to establish the
 
02:51:13.150 --> 02:51:13.160 align:start position:0%
committee to study the laws around
 
02:51:16.710 --> 02:51:16.720 align:start position:0%
oyster harvesting and lure I again fully
 
02:51:18.070 --> 02:51:18.080 align:start position:0%
support all the testimony received
 
02:51:20.110 --> 02:51:20.120 align:start position:0%
previously and won't repeat everything
 
02:51:22.110 --> 02:51:22.120 align:start position:0%
to put a few additional numbers on some
 
02:51:24.469 --> 02:51:24.479 align:start position:0%
of the testimony that we've seen uh our
 
02:51:28.389 --> 02:51:28.399 align:start position:0%
oyster farms in 2023 provided a $5.5
 
02:51:30.910 --> 02:51:30.920 align:start position:0%
million benefit to our economy in terms
 
02:51:35.429 --> 02:51:35.439 align:start position:0%
of Agriculture coupled with 4.4 million
 
02:51:38.349 --> 02:51:38.359 align:start position:0%
in passive benefits ecologically that is
 
02:51:40.830 --> 02:51:40.840 align:start position:0%
a $9.9 million benefit to the state of
 
02:51:43.630 --> 02:51:43.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in 2023 alone accomplished
 
02:51:45.670 --> 02:51:45.680 align:start position:0%
under our existing framework and that
 
02:51:49.150 --> 02:51:49.160 align:start position:0%
represents a 1, 153% increase increase
 
02:51:52.510 --> 02:51:52.520 align:start position:0%
in the past decade we have done a lot
 
02:51:54.510 --> 02:51:54.520 align:start position:0%
with what we've done now and every
 
02:51:56.670 --> 02:51:56.680 align:start position:0%
single oyster of that commercial Harvest
 
02:51:59.190 --> 02:51:59.200 align:start position:0%
comes from aquaculture we do not have
 
02:52:00.830 --> 02:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
Wild Harvest in the state of New
 
02:52:03.510 --> 02:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire those oyster farms using 95
 
02:52:06.110 --> 02:52:06.120 align:start position:0%
acres are largely located in the little
 
02:52:08.349 --> 02:52:08.359 align:start position:0%
Bay in the Great Bay Estuary with one
 
02:52:11.190 --> 02:52:11.200 align:start position:0%
operating in Hampton and in fact those
 
02:52:12.950 --> 02:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
aquaculture not only do those Farms
 
02:52:14.790 --> 02:52:14.800 align:start position:0%
provide the filtering mechanisms but
 
02:52:16.389 --> 02:52:16.399 align:start position:0%
they are actively going towards
 
02:52:19.269 --> 02:52:19.279 align:start position:0%
reinstating the wild farms and the wild
 
02:52:21.389 --> 02:52:21.399 align:start position:0%
oyster fields that provide additional
 
02:52:24.070 --> 02:52:24.080 align:start position:0%
ecological benefits to the state and in
 
02:52:26.910 --> 02:52:26.920 align:start position:0%
2021 about 30% of the oysters harvested
 
02:52:29.229 --> 02:52:29.239 align:start position:0%
for aquaculture were in turn sold to
 
02:52:31.590 --> 02:52:31.600 align:start position:0%
benefit those ecological projects it is
 
02:52:33.469 --> 02:52:33.479 align:start position:0%
a very self- sustaining and
 
02:52:35.510 --> 02:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
self-benefiting partnership between the
 
02:52:37.550 --> 02:52:37.560 align:start position:0%
oyster Farmers between fish and game
 
02:52:39.309 --> 02:52:39.319 align:start position:0%
between the many conserv efforts going
 
02:52:41.070 --> 02:52:41.080 align:start position:0%
on for a very treasured Great Bay
 
02:52:43.190 --> 02:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
Estuary we have the full support of the
 
02:52:44.870 --> 02:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
farmers are willing to provide any
 
02:52:46.630 --> 02:52:46.640 align:start position:0%
benefits possible and any information
 
02:52:49.229 --> 02:52:49.239 align:start position:0%
needed for the committee full full
 
02:52:50.950 --> 02:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
support on our
 
02:52:54.229 --> 02:52:54.239 align:start position:0%
end thank you are there any questions
 
02:52:54.239 --> 02:52:55.710 align:start position:0%
end thank you are there any questions
representative

02:52:55.710 --> 02:52:55.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:52:58.389 --> 02:52:58.399 align:start position:0%
Khan thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
02:53:01.630 --> 02:53:01.640 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um we have the
 
02:53:04.110 --> 02:53:04.120 align:start position:0%
commission you know they look all you
 
02:53:05.710 --> 02:53:05.720 align:start position:0%
know this is their jurisdiction that
 
02:53:08.630 --> 02:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
they make rules and they look after this
 
02:53:10.630 --> 02:53:10.640 align:start position:0%
why we need another commission to you
 
02:53:12.870 --> 02:53:12.880 align:start position:0%
know create another commission to
 
02:53:16.710 --> 02:53:16.720 align:start position:0%
oversee and funding you know is working
 
02:53:19.229 --> 02:53:19.239 align:start position:0%
right now the way I see it the way
 
02:53:21.670 --> 02:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
they're you know in my knowledge is it's
 
02:53:24.070 --> 02:53:24.080 align:start position:0%
working it is it is working within the
 
02:53:25.630 --> 02:53:25.640 align:start position:0%
current framework but the current
 
02:53:27.630 --> 02:53:27.640 align:start position:0%
framework is not set up to support and
 
02:53:29.590 --> 02:53:29.600 align:start position:0%
prioritize our oyster and shellfish
 
02:53:31.710 --> 02:53:31.720 align:start position:0%
aquaculture in the state this is a
 
02:53:33.510 --> 02:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
rapidly growing industry that has been
 
02:53:35.389 --> 02:53:35.399 align:start position:0%
working within rules and regulations
 
02:53:37.190 --> 02:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
that are not built around oyster
 
02:53:39.229 --> 02:53:39.239 align:start position:0%
aquaculture and oyster harvesting uh we
 
02:53:40.510 --> 02:53:40.520 align:start position:0%
think it would be beneficial to take
 
02:53:42.469 --> 02:53:42.479 align:start position:0%
some time to look at this industry
 
02:53:44.870 --> 02:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
specifically where it is being supported
 
02:53:46.389 --> 02:53:46.399 align:start position:0%
by the current laws where we running
 
02:53:48.510 --> 02:53:48.520 align:start position:0%
into some difficulties in terms of
 
02:53:50.750 --> 02:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
managing and maintaining the Farms um I
 
02:53:52.429 --> 02:53:52.439 align:start position:0%
don't want to dive into specific issues
 
02:53:54.110 --> 02:53:54.120 align:start position:0%
but there are even things in terms of
 
02:53:56.110 --> 02:53:56.120 align:start position:0%
the way legislation is written where it
 
02:53:58.309 --> 02:53:58.319 align:start position:0%
is not necessarily causing an issue um
 
02:54:00.110 --> 02:54:00.120 align:start position:0%
but some things like using the term
 
02:54:02.190 --> 02:54:02.200 align:start position:0%
lease instead of rental things like that
 
02:54:04.070 --> 02:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
cause Insurance impacts for the farmers
 
02:54:05.750 --> 02:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
there are many Ripple effects from how
 
02:54:07.309 --> 02:54:07.319 align:start position:0%
they operate their farms and how we
 
02:54:08.950 --> 02:54:08.960 align:start position:0%
permit them to operate that we think
 
02:54:10.190 --> 02:54:10.200 align:start position:0%
would be really beneficial for the
 
02:54:11.910 --> 02:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
future of the industry to step back and
 
02:54:13.910 --> 02:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
say we support this we would like to see
 
02:54:15.830 --> 02:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
your continued healthy expansion and we
 
02:54:17.190 --> 02:54:17.200 align:start position:0%
want to see what we can do to encourage
 
02:54:17.200 --> 02:54:19.190 align:start position:0%
want to see what we can do to encourage
that

02:54:19.190 --> 02:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:54:21.670 --> 02:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
02:54:26.070 --> 02:54:26.080 align:start position:0%
Harvey I I think I misheard but did you
 
02:54:29.190 --> 02:54:29.200 align:start position:0%
say that uh some of the
 
02:54:33.710 --> 02:54:33.720 align:start position:0%
results and harvest from these um oyster
 
02:54:37.389 --> 02:54:37.399 align:start position:0%
farms supports wild
 
02:54:39.429 --> 02:54:39.439 align:start position:0%
oyster yeah so there are a number of
 
02:54:41.190 --> 02:54:41.200 align:start position:0%
restoration projects you did there are a
 
02:54:42.630 --> 02:54:42.640 align:start position:0%
number of restoration projects being
 
02:54:44.030 --> 02:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
done by our wonderful Partners who have
 
02:54:46.710 --> 02:54:46.720 align:start position:0%
spoken behind us to restore natural
 
02:54:49.309 --> 02:54:49.319 align:start position:0%
oyster reefs and there is a wonderful
 
02:54:52.349 --> 02:54:52.359 align:start position:0%
interplay between an oyster Aquaculture
 
02:54:55.150 --> 02:54:55.160 align:start position:0%
farm and a natural Reef where not only
 
02:54:57.150 --> 02:54:57.160 align:start position:0%
are we raising oysters ones that are not
 
02:54:59.110 --> 02:54:59.120 align:start position:0%
fit for commercial sale can be in turn
 
02:55:00.910 --> 02:55:00.920 align:start position:0%
replanted and help grow our natural
 
02:55:03.110 --> 02:55:03.120 align:start position:0%
reefs but the very existence side by
 
02:55:05.590 --> 02:55:05.600 align:start position:0%
side even the shells that are used from
 
02:55:07.630 --> 02:55:07.640 align:start position:0%
oysters that are sold are then turned
 
02:55:09.269 --> 02:55:09.279 align:start position:0%
and used to grow reefs and provide
 
02:55:12.110 --> 02:55:12.120 align:start position:0%
natural beds for oysters to grow on
 
02:55:15.070 --> 02:55:15.080 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome any other
 
02:55:19.389 --> 02:55:19.399 align:start position:0%
questions I have one please um
 
02:55:23.550 --> 02:55:23.560 align:start position:0%
most of the things that currently have
 
02:55:25.510 --> 02:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
provide a framework under which the
 
02:55:29.590 --> 02:55:29.600 align:start position:0%
oyster aquaculture is being run are
 
02:55:33.150 --> 02:55:33.160 align:start position:0%
rules and um so my question is why would
 
02:55:35.790 --> 02:55:35.800 align:start position:0%
we need a study committee to look at
 
02:55:38.349 --> 02:55:38.359 align:start position:0%
this from a legislative standpoint have
 
02:55:40.550 --> 02:55:40.560 align:start position:0%
you actually approached the commission
 
02:55:42.590 --> 02:55:42.600 align:start position:0%
and the department to talk about rules
 
02:55:44.630 --> 02:55:44.640 align:start position:0%
changes um I will say I'm actually
 
02:55:46.389 --> 02:55:46.399 align:start position:0%
fairly new being involved so I have not
 
02:55:47.950 --> 02:55:47.960 align:start position:0%
personally been involved but I am aware
 
02:55:50.070 --> 02:55:50.080 align:start position:0%
that the oyster Farmers have been this
 
02:55:52.229 --> 02:55:52.239 align:start position:0%
initiative has been running since 2020
 
02:55:53.710 --> 02:55:53.720 align:start position:0%
have formed close Partnerships with Fish
 
02:55:55.710 --> 02:55:55.720 align:start position:0%
and Game have been working on things um
 
02:55:56.790 --> 02:55:56.800 align:start position:0%
but we see this as a wonderful
 
02:55:58.510 --> 02:55:58.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity to really get that step
 
02:56:01.190 --> 02:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
forward and operate as a group to make
 
02:56:02.830 --> 02:56:02.840 align:start position:0%
recommendations versus individual
 
02:56:05.710 --> 02:56:05.720 align:start position:0%
Farmers proposing adjustments to rules
 
02:56:08.870 --> 02:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
thank you any other
 
02:56:11.269 --> 02:56:11.279 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
02:56:13.990 --> 02:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
time thank you I do not have any other
 
02:56:16.269 --> 02:56:16.279 align:start position:0%
cards is there anybody else from the
 
02:56:19.590 --> 02:56:19.600 align:start position:0%
audience who wants to speak that hasn't
 
02:56:21.910 --> 02:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
seeing none I will close the hearing on
 
02:56:21.920 --> 02:56:29.309 align:start position:0%
seeing none I will close the hearing on
HB

02:56:29.309 --> 02:56:29.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:32.630 --> 02:56:32.640 align:start position:0%
61 committee we have a break now uh on
 
02:56:35.190 --> 02:56:35.200 align:start position:0%
paper until 1:00 when we hear our next
 
02:56:38.309 --> 02:56:38.319 align:start position:0%
bill would anybody like to uh move into
 
02:56:44.790 --> 02:56:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:48.910 --> 02:56:48.920 align:start position:0%
Bill let's do that

discussion do we have any questions or
 
02:57:43.030 --> 02:57:43.040 align:start position:0%
discussion from the
 
02:57:46.030 --> 02:57:46.040 align:start position:0%
committee representative Harvey uh thank
 
02:57:48.229 --> 02:57:48.239 align:start position:0%
you and when I first read the bill I was
 
02:57:50.630 --> 02:57:50.640 align:start position:0%
not in favor of it um I felt that it was
 
02:57:52.550 --> 02:57:52.560 align:start position:0%
something that should go through rules
 
02:57:54.510 --> 02:57:54.520 align:start position:0%
um but with the amendment I can support
 
02:57:57.950 --> 02:57:57.960 align:start position:0%
this thank you very much representative
 
02:58:01.269 --> 02:58:01.279 align:start position:0%
Fox thank you chairman for you as a
 
02:58:03.550 --> 02:58:03.560 align:start position:0%
hunter um why would you choose to use an
 
02:58:05.389 --> 02:58:05.399 align:start position:0%
air rifle to hunt as opposed to
 
02:58:09.030 --> 02:58:09.040 align:start position:0%
traditional for me personally um it
 
02:58:10.750 --> 02:58:10.760 align:start position:0%
would be the same as sometimes I want to
 
02:58:12.990 --> 02:58:13.000 align:start position:0%
use my muzzle loader versus regular
 
02:58:15.830 --> 02:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
rifle but I can also see the utility
 
02:58:17.750 --> 02:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
aspect for some someone who lives in a
 
02:58:20.510 --> 02:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
high density area such as the Sea Coast
 
02:58:22.550 --> 02:58:22.560 align:start position:0%
where we do have a large deer population
 
02:58:23.910 --> 02:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
we are having trouble getting enough
 
02:58:25.590 --> 02:58:25.600 align:start position:0%
people out hunting them to decrease the
 
02:58:26.950 --> 02:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
population and this is another
 
02:58:29.110 --> 02:58:29.120 align:start position:0%
alternative besides a bow that would
 
02:58:32.349 --> 02:58:32.359 align:start position:0%
allow them to do so thank
 
02:58:36.269 --> 02:58:36.279 align:start position:0%
you any other comments representative
 
02:58:39.389 --> 02:58:39.399 align:start position:0%
Jacobs um uh are you familiar at all
 
02:58:41.790 --> 02:58:41.800 align:start position:0%
with why other states haven't approved
 
02:58:41.800 --> 02:58:43.309 align:start position:0%
with why other states haven't approved
these

02:58:43.309 --> 02:58:43.319 align:start position:0%
these
 
02:58:46.950 --> 02:58:46.960 align:start position:0%
um guns because they're so new is my
 
02:58:49.950 --> 02:58:49.960 align:start position:0%
understanding ument Jordan do you have
 
02:58:49.960 --> 02:58:51.190 align:start position:0%
understanding ument Jordan do you have
are

02:58:51.190 --> 02:58:51.200 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:58:53.389 --> 02:58:53.399 align:start position:0%
states if you'd like to take the mic you
 
02:58:56.309 --> 02:58:56.319 align:start position:0%
can explain uh just a little bit of that
 
02:58:57.710 --> 02:58:57.720 align:start position:0%
since we have an expert here I'll let
 
02:58:59.510 --> 02:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
him answer our
 
02:59:01.790 --> 02:59:01.800 align:start position:0%
question so I just check with my my
 
02:59:04.389 --> 02:59:04.399 align:start position:0%
executive director is here by the way uh

Washington State uh allowed for it and I
 
02:59:12.389 --> 02:59:12.399 align:start position:0%
believe there are three I I may be wrong
 
02:59:13.870 --> 02:59:13.880 align:start position:0%
on this but I believe there were three
 
02:59:16.150 --> 02:59:16.160 align:start position:0%
western states that allow that after
 
02:59:18.110 --> 02:59:18.120 align:start position:0%
kind of the same kind of consideration
 
02:59:21.870 --> 02:59:21.880 align:start position:0%
we've done um I don't know of any in New
 
02:59:24.269 --> 02:59:24.279 align:start position:0%

hp61 um if we were to vote in that
 
03:07:06.110 --> 03:07:06.120 align:start position:0%
committee uh there's no fiscal impact
 
03:07:07.990 --> 03:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
for the state is it just the time of the
 
03:07:09.349 --> 03:07:09.359 align:start position:0%
people who are serving it doesn't have a
 
03:07:12.750 --> 03:07:12.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal note and it's usually um just the
 
03:07:14.510 --> 03:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
people who have to get stuck on the
 
03:07:15.590 --> 03:07:15.600 align:start position:0%
committee for the
 
03:07:18.150 --> 03:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
summertime uh however times many times
 
03:07:20.990 --> 03:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
they decide to meet and and whatnot it's
 
03:07:22.750 --> 03:07:22.760 align:start position:0%
uh it's a statutory committee so it
 
03:07:25.030 --> 03:07:25.040 align:start position:0%
would it would end up meeting after our
 
03:07:26.950 --> 03:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
legislative session ends but before the
 
03:07:29.550 --> 03:07:29.560 align:start position:0%
fall comes in and usually there's a
 
03:07:31.510 --> 03:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
deadline in the bill about when a report
 
03:07:34.110 --> 03:07:34.120 align:start position:0%
needs to be generated and and so it
 
03:07:35.830 --> 03:07:35.840 align:start position:0%
usually entails someone from the Senate
 
03:07:39.190 --> 03:07:39.200 align:start position:0%
who never shows up and uh two members
 
03:07:41.790 --> 03:07:41.800 align:start position:0%
from the house that usually do show up
 
03:07:45.670 --> 03:07:45.680 align:start position:0%

a child the year before she got married
 
04:04:23.110 --> 04:04:23.120 align:start position:0%
because of timing family uh timing
 
04:04:26.030 --> 04:04:26.040 align:start position:0%
reasons but she definitely um feels part
 
04:04:27.910 --> 04:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
of a family with her
 
04:04:32.349 --> 04:04:32.359 align:start position:0%
fiance my ex-wife uh is uh cohabited
 
04:04:35.110 --> 04:04:35.120 align:start position:0%
with a partner um for many many years
 
04:04:37.030 --> 04:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
that my daughters considered to be their
 
04:04:39.110 --> 04:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
stepfather for all intents and purposes
 
04:04:41.510 --> 04:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
similar with my to my wife's uh
 
04:04:45.189 --> 04:04:45.199 align:start position:0%
ex-husband and uh his partner
 
04:04:47.630 --> 04:04:47.640 align:start position:0%
there's a need to um to increase
 
04:04:50.870 --> 04:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
Outreach to new groups um to increase uh
 
04:04:54.990 --> 04:04:55.000 align:start position:0%
this for the hike safe card um and often
 
04:04:58.030 --> 04:04:58.040 align:start position:0%
young uh younger uh PE the younger
 
04:05:00.269 --> 04:05:00.279 align:start position:0%
Generations have a different mo more
 
04:05:04.790 --> 04:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
modern definition of family Tyler Ray uh
 
04:05:08.910 --> 04:05:08.920 align:start position:0%
uh um testified at the um that study
 
04:05:10.990 --> 04:05:11.000 align:start position:0%
committee that I mentioned um and he
 
04:05:13.429 --> 04:05:13.439 align:start position:0%
recom he recommended targeting a younger
 
04:05:16.269 --> 04:05:16.279 align:start position:0%
a audience and developing uh strategic
 
04:05:20.269 --> 04:05:20.279 align:start position:0%
Partnerships um and uh uh organizations
 
04:05:22.309 --> 04:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
may I believe that organizations may not
 
04:05:24.910 --> 04:05:24.920 align:start position:0%
promote the card uh if they don't feel
 
04:05:27.429 --> 04:05:27.439 align:start position:0%
like the family the definition of family
 
04:05:29.750 --> 04:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
accurately matches their
 
04:05:31.910 --> 04:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
membership I have discussed this with
 
04:05:33.990 --> 04:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
fif fishing game and in particular uh
 
04:05:35.590 --> 04:05:35.600 align:start position:0%
Colonel Jordan who I believe is going to
 
04:05:39.389 --> 04:05:39.399 align:start position:0%
testify shortly um about the uh about
 
04:05:42.030 --> 04:05:42.040 align:start position:0%
this bill before and he recommended a
 
04:05:43.910 --> 04:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
Amendment um that I have and I'd like to
 
04:05:46.590 --> 04:05:46.600 align:start position:0%
pass out if that's possible um after my
 
04:05:49.790 --> 04:05:49.800 align:start position:0%
testimony um that adds some clarifying
 
04:05:51.389 --> 04:05:51.399 align:start position:0%
language with respect to domestic
 
04:05:55.389 --> 04:05:55.399 align:start position:0%
Partners um it um the domestic partner
 
04:05:58.870 --> 04:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
is used in one statement uh one place in
 
04:06:00.710 --> 04:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
existing statute but it's not defined
 
04:06:02.910 --> 04:06:02.920 align:start position:0%
this helps to provide that definition it
 
04:06:06.149 --> 04:06:06.159 align:start position:0%
is also defined in administrative rule
 
04:06:09.189 --> 04:06:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:12.389 --> 04:06:12.399 align:start position:0%
60214 in conclusion um you the New
 
04:06:14.349 --> 04:06:14.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hike safe card provides a
 
04:06:17.149 --> 04:06:17.159 align:start position:0%
great way for the community um to
 
04:06:19.349 --> 04:06:19.359 align:start position:0%
support fishing game while staying safe
 
04:06:22.229 --> 04:06:22.239 align:start position:0%
on the trails sales can be increased by
 
04:06:25.070 --> 04:06:25.080 align:start position:0%
building new Partnerships um to uh
 
04:06:27.950 --> 04:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
Target a a larger audience and this bill
 
04:06:30.950 --> 04:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
helps to align language uh that increase
 
04:06:32.269 --> 04:06:32.279 align:start position:0%
uh that will help to increase the
 
04:06:36.070 --> 04:06:36.080 align:start position:0%
revenue uh that uh ultimately will help
 
04:06:38.269 --> 04:06:38.279 align:start position:0%
allow fishing game to
 
04:06:41.229 --> 04:06:41.239 align:start position:0%
have rely Less on General funds and be
 
04:06:43.910 --> 04:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
more self-funded thank you very much uh
 
04:06:46.229 --> 04:06:46.239 align:start position:0%
Happy of course to answer any
 
04:06:49.070 --> 04:06:49.080 align:start position:0%
questions thank you are there any
 
04:06:51.429 --> 04:06:51.439 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
04:06:53.710 --> 04:06:53.720 align:start position:0%
wette uh thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
04:06:57.830 --> 04:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um I I uh
 
04:07:01.429 --> 04:07:01.439 align:start position:0%
question I had is is there any concern
 
04:07:04.429 --> 04:07:04.439 align:start position:0%
that actually might lose some Revenue uh
 
04:07:07.269 --> 04:07:07.279 align:start position:0%
for partners that are both buying cards
 
04:07:10.469 --> 04:07:10.479 align:start position:0%
now as and and going to one that there
 
04:07:13.950 --> 04:07:13.960 align:start position:0%
might be any loss of Revenue
 
04:07:18.349 --> 04:07:18.359 align:start position:0%
well I I I might defer that um to uh
 
04:07:20.030 --> 04:07:20.040 align:start position:0%
Colonel Jordan to see if if they're
 
04:07:21.830 --> 04:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
concerned from my own personal
 
04:07:23.590 --> 04:07:23.600 align:start position:0%
perspective I think that people would
 
04:07:27.429 --> 04:07:27.439 align:start position:0%
actually be um I think that people don't
 
04:07:30.469 --> 04:07:30.479 align:start position:0%
understand the definition perhaps of um
 
04:07:32.269 --> 04:07:32.279 align:start position:0%
family and so they might be buying one
 
04:07:33.469 --> 04:07:33.479 align:start position:0%
thinking that they're covered when
 
04:07:35.149 --> 04:07:35.159 align:start position:0%
they're not especially long-term
 
04:07:37.349 --> 04:07:37.359 align:start position:0%
Partnerships um only to be surprised if
 
04:07:38.990 --> 04:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
they actually encountered you know some
 
04:07:42.389 --> 04:07:42.399 align:start position:0%
kind of horrific situation um and you
 
04:07:44.670 --> 04:07:44.680 align:start position:0%
know there's been some
 
04:07:47.149 --> 04:07:47.159 align:start position:0%
um one of the things I thought of for
 
04:07:50.229 --> 04:07:50.239 align:start position:0%
example when uh when putting this bill
 
04:07:52.030 --> 04:07:52.040 align:start position:0%
together was you know could people try
 
04:07:54.590 --> 04:07:54.600 align:start position:0%
to take advantage of it like you got two
 
04:07:56.790 --> 04:07:56.800 align:start position:0%
um two people living together um they
 
04:07:58.389 --> 04:07:58.399 align:start position:0%
share in an apartment and they're like
 
04:08:00.309 --> 04:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
hey we live together we're domestic
 
04:08:02.670 --> 04:08:02.680 align:start position:0%
Partners I I personally am not worried
 
04:08:04.550 --> 04:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
about that because I think that it would
 
04:08:07.229 --> 04:08:07.239 align:start position:0%
be um bit embarrassing for somebody to
 
04:08:10.109 --> 04:08:10.119 align:start position:0%
say yeah I'm trying to save 15 bucks so
 
04:08:12.630 --> 04:08:12.640 align:start position:0%
that I can and I'm saying that my buddy
 
04:08:14.710 --> 04:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
and I are domestic Partners I think
 
04:08:16.710 --> 04:08:16.720 align:start position:0%
that'd be embarrassing so no I'm I'm not
 
04:08:18.670 --> 04:08:18.680 align:start position:0%
personally worried about it thank you
 
04:08:22.189 --> 04:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
for the question thank you any other
 
04:08:26.429 --> 04:08:26.439 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
04:08:26.439 --> 04:08:30.189 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
time

04:08:30.189 --> 04:08:30.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:32.750 --> 04:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely the chair now calls Noah
 
04:08:41.070 --> 04:08:41.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:44.189 --> 04:08:44.199 align:start position:0%
himself uh good morning uh thank you Mr
 
04:08:45.710 --> 04:08:45.720 align:start position:0%
chairman uh members of the committee uh
 
04:08:47.469 --> 04:08:47.479 align:start position:0%
my name is Noah tersi uh I live in
 
04:08:49.309 --> 04:08:49.319 align:start position:0%
Nashville w 8 represented by
 
04:08:51.109 --> 04:08:51.119 align:start position:0%
representative Darby and I'm here today
 
04:08:52.309 --> 04:08:52.319 align:start position:0%
in support of
 
04:08:54.790 --> 04:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
hb44 uh I believe personally that it's
 
04:08:56.189 --> 04:08:56.199 align:start position:0%
important for me to contribute to the
 
04:08:57.710 --> 04:08:57.720 align:start position:0%
stewardship of New Hampshire's natural
 
04:08:59.510 --> 04:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
resources and the outdoor spaces that I
 
04:09:01.790 --> 04:09:01.800 align:start position:0%
enjoy using uh and I don't hunt or fish
 
04:09:03.349 --> 04:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
so the hik safe program gives me the
 
04:09:06.830 --> 04:09:06.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do that um while I always
 
04:09:08.349 --> 04:09:08.359 align:start position:0%
strive to be prepared for my time
 
04:09:10.070 --> 04:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
Outdoors as we've seen in the news this
 
04:09:12.309 --> 04:09:12.319 align:start position:0%
week even careful and experienced hikers
 
04:09:13.870 --> 04:09:13.880 align:start position:0%
can find themselves in trouble
 
04:09:15.550 --> 04:09:15.560 align:start position:0%
and my hike safe card gives me and my
 
04:09:17.269 --> 04:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
wife some additional peace of mind when
 
04:09:19.389 --> 04:09:19.399 align:start position:0%
we're on the trails uh I first
 
04:09:20.790 --> 04:09:20.800 align:start position:0%
discovered the language in the statute
 
04:09:22.389 --> 04:09:22.399 align:start position:0%
that this bill seeks to change two years
 
04:09:24.870 --> 04:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
ago when I went to purchase a h a h safe
 
04:09:27.590 --> 04:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
card for me and my then fiance and I
 
04:09:28.830 --> 04:09:28.840 align:start position:0%
discovered we weren't eligible for the
 
04:09:30.790 --> 04:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
family card despite living together and
 
04:09:32.630 --> 04:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
being only a couple months away from our
 
04:09:34.670 --> 04:09:34.680 align:start position:0%
wedding day that got me thinking about
 
04:09:35.950 --> 04:09:35.960 align:start position:0%
all the other families that would
 
04:09:38.030 --> 04:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
describe themselves as families and yet
 
04:09:39.750 --> 04:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
be excluded from the family hike safe
 
04:09:41.510 --> 04:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
card because of the limits P placed on
 
04:09:44.070 --> 04:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
the program in the statute marriage is
 
04:09:45.870 --> 04:09:45.880 align:start position:0%
not the only thing that defines a family
 
04:09:47.349 --> 04:09:47.359 align:start position:0%
and so I believe that this change in
 
04:09:49.109 --> 04:09:49.119 align:start position:0%
eligibility for the family hike safe
 
04:09:52.149 --> 04:09:52.159 align:start position:0%
card uh is a positive one I think this
 
04:09:53.870 --> 04:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
change will encourage more families to
 
04:09:55.990 --> 04:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
participate in the hik safe program by
 
04:09:57.870 --> 04:09:57.880 align:start position:0%
making purchasing a card easier and more
 
04:09:59.550 --> 04:09:59.560 align:start position:0%
accessible uh since they'll only have to
 
04:10:01.189 --> 04:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
purchase one card they can ensure
 
04:10:03.229 --> 04:10:03.239 align:start position:0%
everyone is covered um instead of having
 
04:10:05.389 --> 04:10:05.399 align:start position:0%
to buy multiple cards or potentially
 
04:10:07.429 --> 04:10:07.439 align:start position:0%
having people go uncovered by the
 
04:10:09.830 --> 04:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
program with more families participating
 
04:10:11.630 --> 04:10:11.640 align:start position:0%
who are not currently uh that means more
 
04:10:12.990 --> 04:10:13.000 align:start position:0%
support for the hard work of Fish and
 
04:10:14.750 --> 04:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
Game officers and Personnel around New
 
04:10:16.149 --> 04:10:16.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who make our outdoor spaces
 
04:10:18.550 --> 04:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
safe for everyone I support this bill
 
04:10:20.109 --> 04:10:20.119 align:start position:0%
because it will make it easier for
 
04:10:21.710 --> 04:10:21.720 align:start position:0%
people to support our state's natural
 
04:10:23.469 --> 04:10:23.479 align:start position:0%
resources while they safely enjoy the
 
04:10:25.389 --> 04:10:25.399 align:start position:0%
beautiful trails and outdoor spaces that
 
04:10:27.109 --> 04:10:27.119 align:start position:0%
make the state a special place and
 
04:10:28.469 --> 04:10:28.479 align:start position:0%
because of that I asked the committee to
 
04:10:29.870 --> 04:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
advance this bill to the Full House with
 
04:10:32.189 --> 04:10:32.199 align:start position:0%
a recommendation of ought to pass uh and
 
04:10:33.670 --> 04:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
I guess I'll say it sounds like a
 
04:10:35.349 --> 04:10:35.359 align:start position:0%
clarifying amendment is something that I
 
04:10:37.830 --> 04:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
would also be amendable to and I have a
 
04:10:40.149 --> 04:10:40.159 align:start position:0%
an additional copy of my testimony if
 
04:10:42.590 --> 04:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
the clerk would like it if you want to
 
04:10:43.950 --> 04:10:43.960 align:start position:0%
pass it around to the clerk she can make
 
04:10:46.830 --> 04:10:46.840 align:start position:0%
sure it goes in the file thank you thank
 
04:10:49.710 --> 04:10:49.720 align:start position:0%
you are there any questions for
 
04:10:55.910 --> 04:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:03.149 --> 04:11:03.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:05.149 --> 04:11:05.159 align:start position:0%

04:11:19.550 --> 04:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
there was some good ideas that came out
 
04:11:21.590 --> 04:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
of that and I'm hopeful that things will
 
04:11:24.309 --> 04:11:24.319 align:start position:0%
change uh moving forward this was one of
 
04:11:26.109 --> 04:11:26.119 align:start position:0%
them that uh representative Darby
 
04:11:28.670 --> 04:11:28.680 align:start position:0%
reached out to me about uh changing the
 
04:11:30.349 --> 04:11:30.359 align:start position:0%
over so if you remember a few years ago
 
04:11:34.389 --> 04:11:34.399 align:start position:0%
we moved to um we we amended the
 
04:11:37.109 --> 04:11:37.119 align:start position:0%
original statute of having a single card
 
04:11:39.910 --> 04:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
for a person or a $35 card for a family
 
04:11:42.830 --> 04:11:42.840 align:start position:0%
we moved to cover adult children who did
 
04:11:42.840 --> 04:11:43.910 align:start position:0%
we moved to cover adult children who did
not

04:11:43.910 --> 04:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:11:45.670 --> 04:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
had not left the home that were
 
04:11:48.109 --> 04:11:48.119 align:start position:0%
emotionally challenged and under under
 
04:11:49.870 --> 04:11:49.880 align:start position:0%
guardianship would they be covered and
 
04:11:52.189 --> 04:11:52.199 align:start position:0%
we added that to the family Bill other
 
04:11:54.030 --> 04:11:54.040 align:start position:0%
than that we've not made any changes to
 
04:11:56.950 --> 04:11:56.960 align:start position:0%
this um moving forward I didn't oppose
 
04:11:59.269 --> 04:11:59.279 align:start position:0%
this at all I thought it was a good idea
 
04:12:02.309 --> 04:12:02.319 align:start position:0%
it will representative olette it may
 
04:12:04.990 --> 04:12:05.000 align:start position:0%
make a difference on income U but I got
 
04:12:06.750 --> 04:12:06.760 align:start position:0%
to tell you you know we look at these
 
04:12:09.109 --> 04:12:09.119 align:start position:0%
very carefully so we've never build I've
 
04:12:12.189 --> 04:12:12.199 align:start position:0%
never build a person that has a hike
 
04:12:13.870 --> 04:12:13.880 align:start position:0%
safe card even though the allows me to
 
04:12:16.469 --> 04:12:16.479 align:start position:0%
do that if they are ridiculously
 
04:12:18.630 --> 04:12:18.640 align:start position:0%
Reckless and they still have a hike safe
 
04:12:21.229 --> 04:12:21.239 align:start position:0%
card they can still face a bill uh the
 
04:12:23.109 --> 04:12:23.119 align:start position:0%
idea of the card was to get everybody to
 
04:12:24.910 --> 04:12:24.920 align:start position:0%
contribute to the system so we've never
 
04:12:26.389 --> 04:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
been put in that position where we've
 
04:12:28.670 --> 04:12:28.680 align:start position:0%
had to do that I've had call some Scout
 
04:12:31.229 --> 04:12:31.239 align:start position:0%
Masters that want to take 10 Boy Scouts
 
04:12:33.590 --> 04:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
up and his question was do I have to buy
 
04:12:36.429 --> 04:12:36.439 align:start position:0%
cards for all 10 of my Scouts and I've
 
04:12:38.510 --> 04:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
indicated you do not if you have a card
 
04:12:39.790 --> 04:12:39.800 align:start position:0%
you will be covered so we're pretty
 
04:12:42.349 --> 04:12:42.359 align:start position:0%
liberal on this anyway uh for the most
 
04:12:44.590 --> 04:12:44.600 align:start position:0%
part so this change I thought was good
 
04:12:47.269 --> 04:12:47.279 align:start position:0%
the only issue I had with his change and
 
04:12:48.750 --> 04:12:48.760 align:start position:0%
that's why you have the amendment before
 
04:12:51.870 --> 04:12:51.880 align:start position:0%
you is I wanted some sort of formal uh
 
04:12:53.349 --> 04:12:53.359 align:start position:0%
reference or description of what a
 
04:12:55.870 --> 04:12:55.880 align:start position:0%
domestic partner was so we wouldn't have
 
04:12:57.510 --> 04:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
two people hiking together saying well
 
04:12:59.670 --> 04:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
I've got a hike safe card but you don't
 
04:13:01.309 --> 04:13:01.319 align:start position:0%
and so today you'll be my domestic
 
04:13:03.510 --> 04:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
partner so he put in the bill that it
 
04:13:05.229 --> 04:13:05.239 align:start position:0%
means someone who shares the same
 
04:13:07.309 --> 04:13:07.319 align:start position:0%
address as the purchaser and then the
 
04:13:09.870 --> 04:13:09.880 align:start position:0%
Justice rule uh attorney general's rule
 
04:13:12.030 --> 04:13:12.040 align:start position:0%
that he referred to describes that
 
04:13:13.670 --> 04:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
pretty accurately so I can defend that
 
04:13:16.670 --> 04:13:16.680 align:start position:0%
in court if that becomes an issue um so
 
04:13:18.469 --> 04:13:18.479 align:start position:0%
I would urge you to pass it we I didn't
 
04:13:19.670 --> 04:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
tell you this at the beginning I
 
04:13:21.910 --> 04:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
apologize the commission reviewed this
 
04:13:23.950 --> 04:13:23.960 align:start position:0%
after our recommendation we voted to
 
04:13:25.349 --> 04:13:25.359 align:start position:0%
support this
 
04:13:27.710 --> 04:13:27.720 align:start position:0%
change thank you any questions
 
04:13:27.720 --> 04:13:29.030 align:start position:0%
change thank you any questions
representative

04:13:29.030 --> 04:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:13:31.269 --> 04:13:31.279 align:start position:0%
Harvey why didn't you raise the price of
 
04:13:33.950 --> 04:13:33.960 align:start position:0%
it it's a cheap card the idea was yeah
 
04:13:35.790 --> 04:13:35.800 align:start position:0%
and I get that a lot in fact I I get
 
04:13:36.830 --> 04:13:36.840 align:start position:0%
question you know why don't you make it
 
04:13:40.109 --> 04:13:40.119 align:start position:0%
$100 card the idea of it the thing that
 
04:13:43.630 --> 04:13:43.640 align:start position:0%
that two things I looked at in in 20 15
 
04:13:44.990 --> 04:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
I was a little skeptical that it would
 
04:13:49.070 --> 04:13:49.080 align:start position:0%
even work to be honest um and I was
 
04:13:52.030 --> 04:13:52.040 align:start position:0%
pleasantly surprised it's only grown in
 
04:13:54.590 --> 04:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
in every year since then so I'm a little
 
04:13:56.070 --> 04:13:56.080 align:start position:0%
lery of raising it where it's a
 
04:13:58.109 --> 04:13:58.119 align:start position:0%
voluntary fee I think you could hit a
 
04:14:01.030 --> 04:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
point where people won't buy it um and
 
04:14:04.910 --> 04:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
so you know now you can have a if you
 
04:14:07.990 --> 04:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
have a hunting license a fishing license
 
04:14:10.229 --> 04:14:10.239 align:start position:0%
any one of these an OHV registered a
 
04:14:12.309 --> 04:14:12.319 align:start position:0%
boat registered a snow machine
 
04:14:14.070 --> 04:14:14.080 align:start position:0%
registered you've already contributed
 
04:14:15.469 --> 04:14:15.479 align:start position:0%
this you don't need a hike safe what I'm
 
04:14:17.710 --> 04:14:17.720 align:start position:0%
finding is a lot of those very people
 
04:14:19.670 --> 04:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
are also buying a hike safe card so
 
04:14:22.389 --> 04:14:22.399 align:start position:0%
you're adding if we increase that price
 
04:14:23.910 --> 04:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
it would probably add to that so I'm a
 
04:14:25.990 --> 04:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
little leery at doing that I think and
 
04:14:27.910 --> 04:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
and then people will say to me why can't
 
04:14:29.710 --> 04:14:29.720 align:start position:0%
I print the card how come I don't get a
 
04:14:32.109 --> 04:14:32.119 align:start position:0%
fancy card because I wanted every dollar
 
04:14:34.750 --> 04:14:34.760 align:start position:0%
of this to go into search and rescue so
 
04:14:36.510 --> 04:14:36.520 align:start position:0%
I wanted to keep the administrative cost
 
04:14:38.590 --> 04:14:38.600 align:start position:0%
to a minimum so we don't make a card
 
04:14:40.630 --> 04:14:40.640 align:start position:0%
they just go online and do it and and
 
04:14:43.030 --> 04:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
that was the whole goal of it it hit
 
04:14:45.510 --> 04:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
over $300,000 this past year which was
 
04:14:47.429 --> 04:14:47.439 align:start position:0%
tremendous so it's been pretty good but
 
04:14:49.590 --> 04:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
we you know we could increase it I just
 
04:14:51.590 --> 04:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
worry and and the other thing that
 
04:14:53.630 --> 04:14:53.640 align:start position:0%
happens is there are constantly people
 
04:14:55.670 --> 04:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
trying to attach things to it because it
 
04:14:57.269 --> 04:14:57.279 align:start position:0%
has been a success so they're trying to
 
04:14:59.349 --> 04:14:59.359 align:start position:0%
hook other things to it I fight like a
 
04:15:02.189 --> 04:15:02.199 align:start position:0%
cage dog because it's one program that's
 
04:15:04.590 --> 04:15:04.600 align:start position:0%
worked well let's not mess it up let's
 
04:15:06.630 --> 04:15:06.640 align:start position:0%
leave it where it is and and it's making
 
04:15:08.750 --> 04:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
good money for us I'm using it every
 
04:15:10.149 --> 04:15:10.159 align:start position:0%
year to buy equipment at the end of the
 
04:15:11.670 --> 04:15:11.680 align:start position:0%
year I bought a cruiser with it last
 
04:15:13.790 --> 04:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
year uh that we would have never been
 
04:15:15.710 --> 04:15:15.720 align:start position:0%
able to purchase so it's it's been a big
 
04:15:18.630 --> 04:15:18.640 align:start position:0%
help and I I do agree with repres even
 
04:15:19.950 --> 04:15:19.960 align:start position:0%
this old dinosaur agrees with
 
04:15:21.590 --> 04:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
representative Darby kids aren't getting
 
04:15:23.710 --> 04:15:23.720 align:start position:0%
married as much um there are a lot of
 
04:15:25.030 --> 04:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
people living together that don't share
 
04:15:27.670 --> 04:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
a marriage license and and that's not
 
04:15:29.189 --> 04:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
something I ever thought about so it' be
 
04:15:31.429 --> 04:15:31.439 align:start position:0%
nice to have something to cover
 
04:15:33.670 --> 04:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
04:15:35.630 --> 04:15:35.640 align:start position:0%
ulette thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
04:15:38.349 --> 04:15:38.359 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question yes sir have
 
04:15:40.349 --> 04:15:40.359 align:start position:0%
just as we're sitting here thinking it's
 
04:15:42.309 --> 04:15:42.319 align:start position:0%
it's nice to see what a success the hike
 
04:15:45.710 --> 04:15:45.720 align:start position:0%
stfe card is has been yes um I know as
 
04:15:47.269 --> 04:15:47.279 align:start position:0%
snowmobile racing in the country the
 
04:15:48.429 --> 04:15:48.439 align:start position:0%
biggest organization is the
 
04:15:49.710 --> 04:15:49.720 align:start position:0%
international snowmobile racing
 
04:15:52.269 --> 04:15:52.279 align:start position:0%
association yes when you become a member
 
04:15:54.469 --> 04:15:54.479 align:start position:0%
you pay $25 but there's an insurance
 
04:15:56.469 --> 04:15:56.479 align:start position:0%
policy that goes along with it yep have
 
04:15:57.670 --> 04:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
you looked at putting an insurance
 
04:16:00.830 --> 04:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
policy I have and so we met several
 
04:16:02.870 --> 04:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
years ago we met with several insurance
 
04:16:05.229 --> 04:16:05.239 align:start position:0%
companies and they want no part of it
 
04:16:06.710 --> 04:16:06.720 align:start position:0%
they don't want to insure it because
 
04:16:10.189 --> 04:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
they feel that the um I'm trying to
 
04:16:12.189 --> 04:16:12.199 align:start position:0%
think of the term you use the liability
 
04:16:14.550 --> 04:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
attached to it would be huge cuz it
 
04:16:16.590 --> 04:16:16.600 align:start position:0%
happens he asked me for the numbers of
 
04:16:18.030 --> 04:16:18.040 align:start position:0%
how many of these things we do when I
 
04:16:19.630 --> 04:16:19.640 align:start position:0%
gave him that that ended our meet that
 
04:16:22.429 --> 04:16:22.439 align:start position:0%
ended our conversation so we tried you
 
04:16:23.910 --> 04:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
know just over the and you know because
 
04:16:25.790 --> 04:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
you've been a part of it some of it but
 
04:16:28.469 --> 04:16:28.479 align:start position:0%
over the years I've tried uh tax on
 
04:16:30.990 --> 04:16:31.000 align:start position:0%
hiking gear I've tried water a tax on
 
04:16:33.349 --> 04:16:33.359 align:start position:0%
the local water Distillery I've tried
 
04:16:35.189 --> 04:16:35.199 align:start position:0%
all these different insurances to cover
 
04:16:37.389 --> 04:16:37.399 align:start position:0%
all these different things and Licensing
 
04:16:39.149 --> 04:16:39.159 align:start position:0%
them but then I'd have to have uh
 
04:16:40.550 --> 04:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
officers hiking the mountains to make
 
04:16:41.870 --> 04:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
sure they have a they have a hiking
 
04:16:43.990 --> 04:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
license and and then you struggle with
 
04:16:45.790 --> 04:16:45.800 align:start position:0%
well what's hiking and what's walking
 
04:16:48.229 --> 04:16:48.239 align:start position:0%
and and you know when when is it fair to
 
04:16:50.550 --> 04:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
charge so this was really the resolve of
 
04:16:52.990 --> 04:16:53.000 align:start position:0%
that um this hike safe card and it and
 
04:16:56.189 --> 04:16:56.199 align:start position:0%
it I think it's reached a a good medium
 
04:16:58.429 --> 04:16:58.439 align:start position:0%
um I think it's probably time to look at
 
04:17:00.070 --> 04:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
maybe increasing it a little bit but I'm
 
04:17:01.710 --> 04:17:01.720 align:start position:0%
a little cautious to do it just because
 
04:17:04.189 --> 04:17:04.199 align:start position:0%
it's going so well I think if we hit a
 
04:17:06.309 --> 04:17:06.319 align:start position:0%
plateau then I might mess with it a
 
04:17:07.870 --> 04:17:07.880 align:start position:0%
little bit to see if we can get it up a
 
04:17:10.070 --> 04:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
little higher than that but um and you
 
04:17:12.309 --> 04:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
know that the I never ceases to amaze me
 
04:17:13.870 --> 04:17:13.880 align:start position:0%
how many people in tune with this as I
 
04:17:16.670 --> 04:17:16.680 align:start position:0%
said to you these two poor women were in
 
04:17:19.550 --> 04:17:19.560 align:start position:0%
in 40 below or 50 below weather up there
 
04:17:21.349 --> 04:17:21.359 align:start position:0%
freezing to death standing together and
 
04:17:22.990 --> 04:17:23.000 align:start position:0%
had been for three hours when my team
 
04:17:25.149 --> 04:17:25.159 align:start position:0%
arrived there the first things they said
 
04:17:28.309 --> 04:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
were we have hike safe cards both of us
 
04:17:31.990 --> 04:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
so it's it's really um in the front of
 
04:17:34.189 --> 04:17:34.199 align:start position:0%
people's minds which is great so that's
 
04:17:34.199 --> 04:17:36.229 align:start position:0%
people's minds which is great so that's
really

04:17:36.229 --> 04:17:36.239 align:start position:0%
really
 
04:17:38.189 --> 04:17:38.199 align:start position:0%
good any other
 
04:17:41.189 --> 04:17:41.199 align:start position:0%
questions representative Pearson how
 
04:17:44.670 --> 04:17:44.680 align:start position:0%
many search and rescues do you Bill in
 
04:17:46.990 --> 04:17:47.000 align:start position:0%
yeah in yeah so I get asked that a lot I
 
04:17:48.510 --> 04:17:48.520 align:start position:0%
get calls by the way we get calls from
 
04:17:50.149 --> 04:17:50.159 align:start position:0%
all over the country because people
 
04:17:52.149 --> 04:17:52.159 align:start position:0%
think this is a good thing and they
 
04:17:55.590 --> 04:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
asked me questions like um if it's okay
 
04:17:57.429 --> 04:17:57.439 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman they asked me questions like
 
04:18:00.830 --> 04:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
does this prevent um people from calling
 
04:18:02.349 --> 04:18:02.359 align:start position:0%
because that was one of the naysayers
 
04:18:03.510 --> 04:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
this is going to prevent people from
 
04:18:05.710 --> 04:18:05.720 align:start position:0%
calling if you start billing I argued
 
04:18:07.109 --> 04:18:07.119 align:start position:0%
it's not going to if people think
 
04:18:08.269 --> 04:18:08.279 align:start position:0%
they're going to die they're going to
 
04:18:09.429 --> 04:18:09.439 align:start position:0%
call for an ambulance they don't ask
 
04:18:10.670 --> 04:18:10.680 align:start position:0%
when they're at a car accident how much
 
04:18:12.030 --> 04:18:12.040 align:start position:0%
is the ambulance ride going to cost me
 
04:18:13.510 --> 04:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
they get to the hospital then they worry
 
04:18:15.750 --> 04:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
about it that's what happens to us so it
 
04:18:17.389 --> 04:18:17.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't it doesn't create worse
 
04:18:20.870 --> 04:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
situations we don't do it a lot I use it
 
04:18:22.830 --> 04:18:22.840 align:start position:0%
as an advertising tool you'll see me use
 
04:18:24.950 --> 04:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
it in the press a lot because I I don't
 
04:18:26.950 --> 04:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
have a way to measure this but I know
 
04:18:29.550 --> 04:18:29.560 align:start position:0%
for a fact it prevents problems because
 
04:18:30.870 --> 04:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
they are worried that they could
 
04:18:32.910 --> 04:18:32.920 align:start position:0%
potentially face a bill so I think it
 
04:18:34.550 --> 04:18:34.560 align:start position:0%
causes people to think about a little
 
04:18:37.710 --> 04:18:37.720 align:start position:0%
bit so we do 180 missions I I look at
 
04:18:39.630 --> 04:18:39.640 align:start position:0%
this about every 10 years average it out
 
04:18:41.710 --> 04:18:41.720 align:start position:0%
we do about 180 missions a year on
 
04:18:43.630 --> 04:18:43.640 align:start position:0%
average some years a little higher this
 
04:18:44.750 --> 04:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
year it's going to be a little higher
 
04:18:46.750 --> 04:18:46.760 align:start position:0%
some years a little bit lower we have 14
 
04:18:48.950 --> 04:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
drowning missions almost to the to the
 
04:18:54.229 --> 04:18:54.239 align:start position:0%
number every year 12 to 14 um I Bild 11
 
04:18:57.309 --> 04:18:57.319 align:start position:0%
9 to 11 rescues in a year I don't do we
 
04:18:59.309 --> 04:18:59.319 align:start position:0%
don't do it a lot it's got to be pretty
 
04:19:02.389 --> 04:19:02.399 align:start position:0%
egregious Behavior we collect about 60%
 
04:19:05.510 --> 04:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
of the ones that we Bill uh I make deals
 
04:19:07.510 --> 04:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
with a lot of people I'm not above that
 
04:19:09.309 --> 04:19:09.319 align:start position:0%
you know when you've got a $40,000
 
04:19:11.429 --> 04:19:11.439 align:start position:0%
rescue that's a lot of money so people
 
04:19:13.309 --> 04:19:13.319 align:start position:0%
will say listen I have five Grand would
 
04:19:15.269 --> 04:19:15.279 align:start position:0%
you take that we've done that I've taken
 
04:19:17.229 --> 04:19:17.239 align:start position:0%
donations when I've sent a bill they
 
04:19:19.830 --> 04:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to donate to the Cause We've let
 
04:19:22.229 --> 04:19:22.239 align:start position:0%
the bill go um so we're we're really
 
04:19:23.750 --> 04:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
pretty flexible on that I've got an
 
04:19:25.750 --> 04:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
administrative assistant who's become a
 
04:19:28.510 --> 04:19:28.520 align:start position:0%
collection agent much to her dismay but
 
04:19:30.910 --> 04:19:30.920 align:start position:0%
it but uh so we don't do a lot of it but
 
04:19:33.830 --> 04:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a tool that keeps people
 
04:19:36.469 --> 04:19:36.479 align:start position:0%
buying cards more importantly for me
 
04:19:38.990 --> 04:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
keeps them I hope hiking safely so that
 
04:19:40.710 --> 04:19:40.720 align:start position:0%
we don't have to deal with it so it
 
04:19:42.269 --> 04:19:42.279 align:start position:0%
promotes all of that so I think it's a
 
04:19:45.070 --> 04:19:45.080 align:start position:0%
great tool for that yes
 
04:19:48.750 --> 04:19:48.760 align:start position:0%
sir any other questions that's a good
 
04:19:51.389 --> 04:19:51.399 align:start position:0%

card seeing no one I will now close the
 
04:20:10.109 --> 04:20:10.119 align:start position:0%

license and Mr chairman I'm reading from
 
04:32:24.870 --> 04:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
the uh Bill methodology this bill
 
04:32:28.550 --> 04:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
replaces 300 fee for a lifetime
 
04:32:30.469 --> 04:32:30.479 align:start position:0%
combination hunting and fishing license
 
04:32:33.990 --> 04:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
for residents under the age of one year
 
04:32:37.070 --> 04:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
newborn license with a Authority for the
 
04:32:40.070 --> 04:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
executive director to establish the uh
 
04:32:43.070 --> 04:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
the fee through administrative Ru making
 
04:32:45.710 --> 04:32:45.720 align:start position:0%
the department assumes the fee for such
 
04:32:48.590 --> 04:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
a license will increase significantly
 
04:32:51.149 --> 04:32:51.159 align:start position:0%
when determined actually as required by
 
04:32:52.590 --> 04:32:52.600 align:start position:0%
the by the
 
04:32:55.149 --> 04:32:55.159 align:start position:0%
bill the department also assumed that
 
04:32:58.070 --> 04:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
such an increase will serve the uh serve
 
04:33:01.149 --> 04:33:01.159 align:start position:0%
to reduce the number of such license
 
04:33:03.870 --> 04:33:03.880 align:start position:0%
sold annually ultimately the department
 
04:33:06.629 --> 04:33:06.639 align:start position:0%
cannot estimate what impact the
 
04:33:10.070 --> 04:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
increased license fee will have on
 
04:33:13.590 --> 04:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
Revenue though the expectation is that
 
04:33:16.709 --> 04:33:16.719 align:start position:0%
bill will result in a net
 
04:33:19.750 --> 04:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
increase for information informational
 
04:33:23.150 --> 04:33:23.160 align:start position:0%
purpose in 2023 the department sold
 
04:33:26.949 --> 04:33:26.959 align:start position:0%

80 I can answer any question if any U
 
04:34:04.109 --> 04:34:04.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:08.429 --> 04:34:08.439 align:start position:0%
have any questions for representative
 
04:34:11.230 --> 04:34:11.240 align:start position:0%
KH representative Harvey thank you Mr
 
04:34:15.390 --> 04:34:15.400 align:start position:0%
chair so um I thought I was following
 
04:34:19.109 --> 04:34:19.119 align:start position:0%
and then I got confused um happens a lot
 
04:34:21.910 --> 04:34:21.920 align:start position:0%
so are you saying that the director will
 
04:34:23.910 --> 04:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
set the fees there there might be a
 
04:34:26.029 --> 04:34:26.039 align:start position:0%
different fee scheduled for a newborn
 
04:34:29.830 --> 04:34:29.840 align:start position:0%
that's 0o to one and then a another fee
 
04:34:33.189 --> 04:34:33.199 align:start position:0%
for someone that's 1 to 16 is that what
 
04:34:33.199 --> 04:34:34.109 align:start position:0%
for someone that's 1 to 16 is that what
you're

04:34:34.109 --> 04:34:34.119 align:start position:0%
you're
 
04:34:37.551 --> 04:34:37.561 align:start position:0%
saying uh representative I was not ready
 
04:34:40.789 --> 04:34:40.799 align:start position:0%
for this question would you mind if um a
 
04:34:42.429 --> 04:34:42.439 align:start position:0%
department uh
 
04:34:48.230 --> 04:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:52.789 --> 04:34:52.799 align:start position:0%
anybody so yes I'm I'm sorry I didn't do
 
04:34:55.510 --> 04:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
a card I'll do a card for you
 
04:34:57.709 --> 04:34:57.719 align:start position:0%
um for the record my name is Kevin
 
04:34:59.830 --> 04:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
Jordan I'm the colonel at n fishing game
 
04:35:01.949 --> 04:35:01.959 align:start position:0%
um and the commission voted to support
 
04:35:05.750 --> 04:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
this bill this change so yes I believe
 
04:35:07.750 --> 04:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that she would set a
 
04:35:11.070 --> 04:35:11.080 align:start position:0%
different fee in rule for the infant
 
04:35:13.670 --> 04:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
license and everything above an infant
 
04:35:16.551 --> 04:35:16.561 align:start position:0%
would start at age 16 so these are when
 
04:35:18.150 --> 04:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
they figure a lifetime license they're
 
04:35:21.230 --> 04:35:21.240 align:start position:0%
done on actuary table depending on your
 
04:35:23.029 --> 04:35:23.039 align:start position:0%
age they estimate how many years you'll
 
04:35:24.709 --> 04:35:24.719 align:start position:0%
live and your license is adjusted
 
04:35:27.429 --> 04:35:27.439 align:start position:0%
accordingly the price of it um for me
 
04:35:29.709 --> 04:35:29.719 align:start position:0%
it'd be $10 but for a young person it
 
04:35:32.470 --> 04:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
would be uh hundreds of dollars and so
 
04:35:34.551 --> 04:35:34.561 align:start position:0%
what's happening is we're selling a lot
 
04:35:37.830 --> 04:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
of these which is a good thing um except
 
04:35:39.789 --> 04:35:39.799 align:start position:0%
in time down the road this is going to
 
04:35:42.029 --> 04:35:42.039 align:start position:0%
cost us significantly we've lost a lot
 
04:35:44.709 --> 04:35:44.719 align:start position:0%
of or will lose a lot of Revenue so we
 
04:35:48.510 --> 04:35:48.520 align:start position:0%
wanted the ability to adjust this um so
 
04:35:50.629 --> 04:35:50.639 align:start position:0%
yes to answer your question she would
 
04:35:52.150 --> 04:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
she would have one price for the B for
 
04:35:54.470 --> 04:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
the infants under a year and she would
 
04:35:57.109 --> 04:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
start with uh anything above a year my
 
04:35:59.590 --> 04:35:59.600 align:start position:0%
reading of it my understanding of it uh
 
04:36:02.551 --> 04:36:02.561 align:start position:0%
would start on the table at age
 
04:36:05.750 --> 04:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
16 she would so I could go in for my
 
04:36:08.390 --> 04:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
5-year-old I could buy him or her a
 
04:36:10.590 --> 04:36:10.600 align:start position:0%
lifetime license but I would pay
 
04:36:14.470 --> 04:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
according the same as if my child was 16
 
04:36:14.480 --> 04:36:18.310 align:start position:0%
according the same as if my child was 16
yeah

04:36:18.310 --> 04:36:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:20.629 --> 04:36:20.639 align:start position:0%
yes thank you and my license was only
 
04:36:22.910 --> 04:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
$50 too yeah mine is mine was a good
 
04:36:22.920 --> 04:36:26.230 align:start position:0%
$50 too yeah mine is mine was a good
deal

04:36:26.230 --> 04:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:30.150 --> 04:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
so represent Fox thank you Mr chairman
 
04:36:31.949 --> 04:36:31.959 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question yes sir
 
04:36:35.789 --> 04:36:35.799 align:start position:0%
any idea what the fee would be for a
 
04:36:38.990 --> 04:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
newborn for this and whether anybody
 
04:36:41.949 --> 04:36:41.959 align:start position:0%
would actually take advantage of it once
 
04:36:45.150 --> 04:36:45.160 align:start position:0%
it's raised so she didn't no one has
 
04:36:47.109 --> 04:36:47.119 align:start position:0%
communicated to me certainly what that
 
04:36:50.150 --> 04:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
would be um I do think they would take
 
04:36:51.709 --> 04:36:51.719 align:start position:0%
advantage of it because it's wildly
 
04:36:53.470 --> 04:36:53.480 align:start position:0%
popular now and I don't think it's
 
04:36:55.830 --> 04:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
popular because of the price I think
 
04:36:57.949 --> 04:36:57.959 align:start position:0%
it's popular because people want to do
 
04:36:59.551 --> 04:36:59.561 align:start position:0%
something for their child so I see
 
04:37:01.029 --> 04:37:01.039 align:start position:0%
grandparents doing it for their
 
04:37:03.150 --> 04:37:03.160 align:start position:0%
grandchildren I did it for all of mine
 
04:37:06.230 --> 04:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
um so I I don't think it'll change that
 
04:37:08.150 --> 04:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
but the income I think it'll be higher
 
04:37:08.160 --> 04:37:08.869 align:start position:0%
but the income I think it'll be higher
than

04:37:08.869 --> 04:37:08.879 align:start position:0%
than
 
04:37:11.109 --> 04:37:11.119 align:start position:0%
$300 um but I don't think it'll be where
 
04:37:14.789 --> 04:37:14.799 align:start position:0%
it is at 16 I think it's 16 and I'm just
 
04:37:16.310 --> 04:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
shooting from the hip here I want to say
 
04:37:18.070 --> 04:37:18.080 align:start position:0%
it's like $15 or
 
04:37:22.470 --> 04:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
$1,800 so at 16 it starts at that so uh
 
04:37:25.310 --> 04:37:25.320 align:start position:0%
it'll be significantly higher thank you
 
04:37:25.320 --> 04:37:28.551 align:start position:0%
it'll be significantly higher thank you
yes

04:37:28.551 --> 04:37:28.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:31.910 --> 04:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
sir any other
 
04:37:34.390 --> 04:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
questions thank you sir I'll I'll get a
 
04:37:47.629 --> 04:37:47.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:54.230 --> 04:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:59.709 --> 04:37:59.719 align:start position:0%

04:39:10.109 --> 04:39:10.119 align:start position:0%
morning that um testified that um this
 
04:39:14.590 --> 04:39:14.600 align:start position:0%
is a a a great idea um it's a
 
04:39:16.949 --> 04:39:16.959 align:start position:0%
complicated idea something that's more
 
04:39:19.670 --> 04:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
complicated than can be taken in rules
 
04:39:24.750 --> 04:39:24.760 align:start position:0%
and um it would be beneficial to the um
 
04:39:27.830 --> 04:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
um the agricultural industry but also to
 
04:39:32.551 --> 04:39:32.561 align:start position:0%
our water and so forth so um I can't
 
04:39:34.551 --> 04:39:34.561 align:start position:0%
support the
 
04:39:37.350 --> 04:39:37.360 align:start position:0%
itl representative
 
04:39:41.708 --> 04:39:41.718 align:start position:0%
wette thank you um the um testimon was
 
04:39:44.110 --> 04:39:44.120 align:start position:0%
very interesting but the two problems I
 
04:39:47.310 --> 04:39:47.320 align:start position:0%
had with it was first of all and both
 
04:39:49.070 --> 04:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
was there was nobody from fishing game
 
04:39:52.590 --> 04:39:52.600 align:start position:0%
or Dees here to uh support it give
 
04:39:55.390 --> 04:39:55.400 align:start position:0%
testimony uh go against it I I think
 
04:39:56.830 --> 04:39:56.840 align:start position:0%
it's got some great ideas but I don't
 
04:39:59.788 --> 04:39:59.798 align:start position:0%
think it's ready to
 
04:40:03.390 --> 04:40:03.400 align:start position:0%
proceed representative Khan Mr chairman
 
04:40:07.070 --> 04:40:07.080 align:start position:0%
thank you uh U byair you know echoed
 
04:40:10.030 --> 04:40:10.040 align:start position:0%
what I was feeling also at the same time
 
04:40:14.708 --> 04:40:14.718 align:start position:0%
I'm not very big to put a commission top
 
04:40:16.868 --> 04:40:16.878 align:start position:0%
of we already have a commission that who
 
04:40:18.868 --> 04:40:18.878 align:start position:0%
is working every
 
04:40:20.708 --> 04:40:20.718 align:start position:0%
day thank
 
04:40:23.270 --> 04:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
04:40:25.590 --> 04:40:25.600 align:start position:0%
Fox I would be inclined to vote against
 
04:40:28.628 --> 04:40:28.638 align:start position:0%
the itl simply because uh it's a it's a
 
04:40:30.868 --> 04:40:30.878 align:start position:0%
small committee I'm not going to cost us
 
04:40:33.350 --> 04:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
anything to get it done and um you know
 
04:40:35.390 --> 04:40:35.400 align:start position:0%
the environmental benefit and the fact
 
04:40:37.830 --> 04:40:37.840 align:start position:0%
that uh oysters and beer for dinner
 
04:40:39.750 --> 04:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
every day of the year make me feel fine
 
04:40:42.708 --> 04:40:42.718 align:start position:0%

04:40:46.868 --> 04:40:46.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:50.430 --> 04:40:50.440 align:start position:0%

first if it if this bill passes it will
 
04:41:02.030 --> 04:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
be people that voted for it that could
 
04:41:04.030 --> 04:41:04.040 align:start position:0%
put on the committee I'm not going to
 
04:41:05.550 --> 04:41:05.560 align:start position:0%
ask someone who was opposed to it to
 
04:41:06.788 --> 04:41:06.798 align:start position:0%
serve on the committee in the middle of
 
04:41:09.030 --> 04:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
their summertime for something that they
 
04:41:11.030 --> 04:41:11.040 align:start position:0%

the
 
05:01:16.670 --> 05:01:16.680 align:start position:0%
department uh they have
 
05:01:19.788 --> 05:01:19.798 align:start position:0%
Revisited the uh levels of Their fines
 
05:01:21.910 --> 05:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
on several areas and they asked that we
 
05:01:21.920 --> 05:01:22.708 align:start position:0%
on several areas and they asked that we
put

05:01:22.708 --> 05:01:22.718 align:start position:0%
put
 
05:01:25.868 --> 05:01:25.878 align:start position:0%
in some uh legislation to allow them to
 
05:01:30.788 --> 05:01:30.798 align:start position:0%
change those and so I did
 
05:01:33.670 --> 05:01:33.680 align:start position:0%
um we will have an amendment to this but
 
05:01:36.110 --> 05:01:36.120 align:start position:0%
it's was ruled non gerain it's another
 
05:01:38.270 --> 05:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
housekeeping thing to be added to the
 
05:01:40.230 --> 05:01:40.240 align:start position:0%
one housekeeping bill but because it
 
05:01:43.990 --> 05:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
wasn't the specific areas of fines and
 
05:01:46.070 --> 05:01:46.080 align:start position:0%
restitution it was ruled that we had to
 
05:01:47.590 --> 05:01:47.600 align:start position:0%
have a public hearing on that Amendment
 
05:01:50.310 --> 05:01:50.320 align:start position:0%
alone so that'll be happening next week
 
05:01:51.788 --> 05:01:51.798 align:start position:0%
um but for the rest of the bill we're
 
05:01:53.990 --> 05:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
here to hear it today and uh so
 
05:01:55.670 --> 05:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
essentially the bill increases the
 
05:01:57.830 --> 05:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
restitution for the illegal taking or
 
05:02:00.270 --> 05:02:00.280 align:start position:0%
possession of certain animals and to
 
05:02:02.548 --> 05:02:02.558 align:start position:0%
make that restitution mandatory it
 
05:02:04.670 --> 05:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
allows for an increased hunting license
 
05:02:06.510 --> 05:02:06.520 align:start position:0%
suspension for a third violation of a
 
05:02:09.190 --> 05:02:09.200 align:start position:0%
fish and game law or regulation and it
 
05:02:10.910 --> 05:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
establishes a Class A misdemeanor
 
05:02:13.270 --> 05:02:13.280 align:start position:0%
penalty for a third offense violation of
 
05:02:15.030 --> 05:02:15.040 align:start position:0%
fishing game offenses that carry a
 
05:02:16.670 --> 05:02:16.680 align:start position:0%
license suspension
 
05:02:19.070 --> 05:02:19.080 align:start position:0%
penalty uh I don't know about the rest
 
05:02:21.670 --> 05:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
of you but uh I was kind of disconcerted
 
05:02:24.190 --> 05:02:24.200 align:start position:0%
when I saw that we had a repeated
 
05:02:24.200 --> 05:02:25.788 align:start position:0%
when I saw that we had a repeated
habitual

05:02:25.788 --> 05:02:25.798 align:start position:0%
habitual
 
05:02:30.310 --> 05:02:30.320 align:start position:0%
um poacher that was arrested and uh they
 
05:02:33.750 --> 05:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
lost their license for a year I was like
 
05:02:33.760 --> 05:02:36.030 align:start position:0%
lost their license for a year I was like
the

05:02:36.030 --> 05:02:36.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:39.390 --> 05:02:39.400 align:start position:0%
heck so fishing game Revisited a lot of
 
05:02:40.628 --> 05:02:40.638 align:start position:0%
their Penal penties and stuff that
 
05:02:41.990 --> 05:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
hadn't been looked at in a very very
 
05:02:43.990 --> 05:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
very long time and under a new economy
 
05:02:46.510 --> 05:02:46.520 align:start position:0%
with new uh needs to deter some of the
 
05:02:48.590 --> 05:02:48.600 align:start position:0%
repeat offenders they asked for some of
 
05:02:51.150 --> 05:02:51.160 align:start position:0%
these changes to be made and so I will
 
05:02:52.990 --> 05:02:53.000 align:start position:0%
leave most of the discussion onto the
 
05:02:54.430 --> 05:02:54.440 align:start position:0%
specifics up to the members of the
 
05:02:55.868 --> 05:02:55.878 align:start position:0%
department who are here to talk about
 
05:02:58.150 --> 05:02:58.160 align:start position:0%
them and if you've got any questions I
 
05:02:59.590 --> 05:02:59.600 align:start position:0%
would probably tell you that they're
 
05:03:04.270 --> 05:03:04.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:08.110 --> 05:03:08.120 align:start position:0%
me representative Harvey uh thank you Mr
 
05:03:10.030 --> 05:03:10.040 align:start position:0%
chair and I'll ask the question you
 
05:03:12.070 --> 05:03:12.080 align:start position:0%
anyway Mr chair and if you don't like it
 
05:03:15.230 --> 05:03:15.240 align:start position:0%
then you can defer it okay um I think
 
05:03:18.750 --> 05:03:18.760 align:start position:0%
this is great and um I'm I'm All forward
 
05:03:22.708 --> 05:03:22.718 align:start position:0%
the only uh issue that I had was the uh
 
05:03:24.548 --> 05:03:24.558 align:start position:0%
fine for
 
05:03:27.310 --> 05:03:27.320 align:start position:0%
Fisher uh Fisher and Bobcat otter and
 
05:03:30.910 --> 05:03:30.920 align:start position:0%
fox definitely we've seen a a very large
 
05:03:34.270 --> 05:03:34.280 align:start position:0%
decline in the number of fer and fox in
 
05:03:38.270 --> 05:03:38.280 align:start position:0%
our uh state so I'd like that F to be
 
05:03:42.190 --> 05:03:42.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:44.110 --> 05:03:44.120 align:start position:0%
well that wouldn't be up to me that's
 
05:03:46.670 --> 05:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
something that I think that the uh the
 
05:03:48.190 --> 05:03:48.200 align:start position:0%
department has a good handle and the
 
05:03:50.628 --> 05:03:50.638 align:start position:0%
biologist of the department decided in
 
05:03:52.548 --> 05:03:52.558 align:start position:0%
discussion what they thought a fine
 
05:03:55.150 --> 05:03:55.160 align:start position:0%
elevation should be and certainly we can
 
05:03:58.230 --> 05:03:58.240 align:start position:0%
all discuss it here but uh it's been put
 
05:03:59.830 --> 05:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
in the bill at 500 because they thought
 
05:04:02.910 --> 05:04:02.920 align:start position:0%
that was appropriate at the time so um
 
05:04:04.948 --> 05:04:04.958 align:start position:0%
if they can if they are convinced to
 
05:04:06.390 --> 05:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
raise it elseways we can put an
 
05:04:12.430 --> 05:04:12.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:16.470 --> 05:04:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:18.750 --> 05:04:18.760 align:start position:0%
Spain thank
 
05:04:21.788 --> 05:04:21.798 align:start position:0%
you which one
 
05:04:25.230 --> 05:04:25.240 align:start position:0%
is so this this is the one next will be
 
05:04:25.240 --> 05:04:30.750 align:start position:0%
is so this this is the one next will be
Colonel

05:04:30.750 --> 05:04:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:34.470 --> 05:04:34.480 align:start position:0%
Jordan good afternoon represent derin
 
05:04:41.910 --> 05:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:44.030 --> 05:04:44.040 align:start position:0%
again my name is uh Kevin Jordan and I'm
 
05:04:45.310 --> 05:04:45.320 align:start position:0%
the colonel at New Hampshire fishing
 
05:04:47.190 --> 05:04:47.200 align:start position:0%
game our commission actually brought
 
05:04:50.070 --> 05:04:50.080 align:start position:0%
this bill so this was one commissioner
 
05:04:52.190 --> 05:04:52.200 align:start position:0%
um it was and he is going to speak I
 
05:04:55.230 --> 05:04:55.240 align:start position:0%
think following me but basically uh he
 
05:04:57.190 --> 05:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
asked for this bill and I worked
 
05:04:59.590 --> 05:04:59.600 align:start position:0%
together with him to create the update
 
05:05:01.708 --> 05:05:01.718 align:start position:0%
so a couple things this bill does is we
 
05:05:04.788 --> 05:05:04.798 align:start position:0%
left it originally it had said if you
 
05:05:07.230 --> 05:05:07.240 align:start position:0%
look on line seven on page two it said
 
05:05:09.708 --> 05:05:09.718 align:start position:0%
may we struck that to put shall because
 
05:05:13.510 --> 05:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
I had judges that um quite literally
 
05:05:15.510 --> 05:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
felt that the fine and the loss of
 
05:05:17.030 --> 05:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
license was enough they didn't need to
 
05:05:20.230 --> 05:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
be charged with restitution so this and
 
05:05:21.830 --> 05:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
judges are good at following the Law
 
05:05:23.430 --> 05:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
whatever law you create they follow it
 
05:05:25.670 --> 05:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
to the letter so that was the idea of
 
05:05:28.110 --> 05:05:28.120 align:start position:0%
striking May and making it shall so they
 
05:05:31.190 --> 05:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
will pay this every time um and then we
 
05:05:32.990 --> 05:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
went down through these these
 
05:05:35.310 --> 05:05:35.320 align:start position:0%
restitution amounts had not changed in a
 
05:05:38.110 --> 05:05:38.120 align:start position:0%
number of years um and we originally
 
05:05:40.788 --> 05:05:40.798 align:start position:0%
talked about changing fines
 
05:05:42.150 --> 05:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
um and there's there's a couple of
 
05:05:43.390 --> 05:05:43.400 align:start position:0%
school couple of things I want to make
 
05:05:45.190 --> 05:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
you aware of on fines first of all to do
 
05:05:47.390 --> 05:05:47.400 align:start position:0%
fines it would require a number of bills
 
05:05:50.350 --> 05:05:50.360 align:start position:0%
to be filed um and so there's a lot of
 
05:05:52.548 --> 05:05:52.558 align:start position:0%
room for that to go
 
05:05:55.868 --> 05:05:55.878 align:start position:0%
astray uh two to to be honest with you
 
05:05:57.708 --> 05:05:57.718 align:start position:0%
when you deal with people in the woods
 
05:05:59.548 --> 05:05:59.558 align:start position:0%
or people fishing it's a different I was
 
05:06:01.430 --> 05:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
a police officer before I came here and
 
05:06:04.190 --> 05:06:04.200 align:start position:0%
it's a different um got to say this
 
05:06:05.628 --> 05:06:05.638 align:start position:0%
carefully it's a different
 
05:06:08.390 --> 05:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
clientele so the the people that I deal
 
05:06:10.830 --> 05:06:10.840 align:start position:0%
with today say to me regularly I will
 
05:06:13.788 --> 05:06:13.798 align:start position:0%
pay anything anything you want I don't
 
05:06:15.430 --> 05:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
want to lose my hunting license I don't
 
05:06:17.868 --> 05:06:17.878 align:start position:0%
want to lose my firearm I don't want to
 
05:06:19.750 --> 05:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
I don't want to go under suspension I
 
05:06:21.750 --> 05:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
don't care about the fine amounts and
 
05:06:23.510 --> 05:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
there is that thought that they'll pay
 
05:06:25.628 --> 05:06:25.638 align:start position:0%
anything and I think financially a lot
 
05:06:28.190 --> 05:06:28.200 align:start position:0%
of those folks are in a better position
 
05:06:30.310 --> 05:06:30.320 align:start position:0%
in their lifetime they've got rifles and
 
05:06:32.230 --> 05:06:32.240 align:start position:0%
Equipment they're in a better economic
 
05:06:34.470 --> 05:06:34.480 align:start position:0%
position to pay those higher fines so I
 
05:06:37.110 --> 05:06:37.120 align:start position:0%
talked to commissioner uh green out of
 
05:06:38.990 --> 05:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
doing the fines and I said let's do the
 
05:06:41.070 --> 05:06:41.080 align:start position:0%
restitution that's something that the
 
05:06:43.510 --> 05:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
the state would benefit from this money
 
05:06:45.110 --> 05:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
could come back in we could put it back
 
05:06:48.708 --> 05:06:48.718 align:start position:0%
into Wildlife or in activities to
 
05:06:51.230 --> 05:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
promote habitats and build these um
 
05:06:52.868 --> 05:06:52.878 align:start position:0%
things back up so we felt that
 
05:06:55.270 --> 05:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
restitution was a better fit we also
 
05:06:57.868 --> 05:06:57.878 align:start position:0%
felt making a mandatory would take away
 
05:07:01.110 --> 05:07:01.120 align:start position:0%
any discretion from the judge um I think
 
05:07:03.190 --> 05:07:03.200 align:start position:0%
they'd follow it where it says shell the
 
05:07:06.310 --> 05:07:06.320 align:start position:0%
second part of this is we do have if you
 
05:07:10.070 --> 05:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
if someone is so any hunting violation
 
05:07:12.110 --> 05:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
carries with it I'll use hunting as an
 
05:07:13.788 --> 05:07:13.798 align:start position:0%
example any hunting violation carries
 
05:07:15.750 --> 05:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
with it one-ear automatic loss of
 
05:07:17.910 --> 05:07:17.920 align:start position:0%
license they have the opportunity or
 
05:07:19.948 --> 05:07:19.958 align:start position:0%
ability to appeal that so we hear from
 
05:07:22.190 --> 05:07:22.200 align:start position:0%
the court that Kevin Jordan paid his
 
05:07:26.310 --> 05:07:26.320 align:start position:0%
fine on November 19th um that is sent to
 
05:07:27.990 --> 05:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
the administrative my Administrative
 
05:07:30.350 --> 05:07:30.360 align:start position:0%
Assistant law enforcement and she sends
 
05:07:32.350 --> 05:07:32.360 align:start position:0%
out a letter to these individuals saying
 
05:07:34.310 --> 05:07:34.320 align:start position:0%
effective on November 19th because of
 
05:07:36.070 --> 05:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
your court conviction your hunting
 
05:07:37.910 --> 05:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
license will be suspended until November
 
05:07:41.350 --> 05:07:41.360 align:start position:0%
19th of next year and so then we but we
 
05:07:42.830 --> 05:07:42.840 align:start position:0%
also in that same letter offer an
 
05:07:44.150 --> 05:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity for a license hearing so
 
05:07:45.948 --> 05:07:45.958 align:start position:0%
they Comm into the license hearing I
 
05:07:48.310 --> 05:07:48.320 align:start position:0%
have the officer who wrote the summons
 
05:07:50.948 --> 05:07:50.958 align:start position:0%
uh myself and the executive director sit
 
05:07:52.390 --> 05:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
and we give them an opportunity to
 
05:07:53.990 --> 05:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
present a case once they've been
 
05:07:56.470 --> 05:07:56.480 align:start position:0%
convicted they can present ideas or
 
05:07:59.548 --> 05:07:59.558 align:start position:0%
arguments to the executive director why
 
05:08:01.750 --> 05:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
that suspension period should
 
05:08:04.350 --> 05:08:04.360 align:start position:0%
change uh they they don't get to debate
 
05:08:05.548 --> 05:08:05.558 align:start position:0%
whether they're innocent or guilty
 
05:08:07.110 --> 05:08:07.120 align:start position:0%
because they've been convicted that that
 
05:08:08.868 --> 05:08:08.878 align:start position:0%
part is over but they can come in and
 
05:08:10.590 --> 05:08:10.600 align:start position:0%
say things like we have a I have a clean
 
05:08:13.430 --> 05:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
record I didn't understand the rule um I
 
05:08:14.750 --> 05:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
didn't think I was violating the law
 
05:08:16.430 --> 05:08:16.440 align:start position:0%
those kinds of things and the executive
 
05:08:18.510 --> 05:08:18.520 align:start position:0%
director takes recommendations from my
 
05:08:21.030 --> 05:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
officer I kind of sit heard on that so
 
05:08:23.430 --> 05:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
we don't go astray and I'm very careful
 
05:08:25.948 --> 05:08:25.958 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we're consistent as
 
05:08:27.750 --> 05:08:27.760 align:start position:0%
much as we can be every scenario is
 
05:08:28.990 --> 05:08:29.000 align:start position:0%
different but you still have to be
 
05:08:31.350 --> 05:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
consistent you can't suspend one Hunter
 
05:08:33.510 --> 05:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
for 12 months for shooting a deer in a
 
05:08:35.470 --> 05:08:35.480 align:start position:0%
close season and the next guy who comes
 
05:08:36.910 --> 05:08:36.920 align:start position:0%
in the next hunter that comes in that
 
05:08:38.470 --> 05:08:38.480 align:start position:0%
did the exact same thing but because
 
05:08:40.390 --> 05:08:40.400 align:start position:0%
he's a nice guy we're going to give him
 
05:08:42.150 --> 05:08:42.160 align:start position:0%
a month suspension you got to stay
 
05:08:43.708 --> 05:08:43.718 align:start position:0%
consistent because these people will do
 
05:08:45.830 --> 05:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
right to knows to find out what you're
 
05:08:48.708 --> 05:08:48.718 align:start position:0%
doing so I I take great pride in the
 
05:08:50.590 --> 05:08:50.600 align:start position:0%
fact that we are consistent I will also
 
05:08:53.310 --> 05:08:53.320 align:start position:0%
tell you that we will negotiate a
 
05:08:55.708 --> 05:08:55.718 align:start position:0%
reduced sentence more often than not if
 
05:08:57.230 --> 05:08:57.240 align:start position:0%
someone takes the time to come to the
 
05:08:59.030 --> 05:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
hearing and they present a reasonable
 
05:09:01.030 --> 05:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
argument and we can determine by talking
 
05:09:03.830 --> 05:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
to them they're truly uh sorry and we've
 
05:09:06.190 --> 05:09:06.200 align:start position:0%
done our job in law enforcement in spite
 
05:09:08.230 --> 05:09:08.240 align:start position:0%
of what my young officers think is not
 
05:09:10.430 --> 05:09:10.440 align:start position:0%
to punish people that's the Court's job
 
05:09:12.590 --> 05:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
our job is to change their behavior so
 
05:09:14.510 --> 05:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
if I can look at a defendant and decide
 
05:09:16.150 --> 05:09:16.160 align:start position:0%
well he's learned this person has
 
05:09:17.948 --> 05:09:17.958 align:start position:0%
learned not going to commit this offense
 
05:09:21.030 --> 05:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
again we can then reduce that sentence
 
05:09:23.510 --> 05:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
when this runs a foul is when you do
 
05:09:25.150 --> 05:09:25.160 align:start position:0%
that or if you don't do that and someone
 
05:09:26.548 --> 05:09:26.558 align:start position:0%
goes under suspension and then they go
 
05:09:28.110 --> 05:09:28.120 align:start position:0%
back out within the next year and they
 
05:09:31.548 --> 05:09:31.558 align:start position:0%
do it again the second time now they get
 
05:09:33.510 --> 05:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
under statute they get an enhanced
 
05:09:36.230 --> 05:09:36.240 align:start position:0%
penalty under current law so if you
 
05:09:40.788 --> 05:09:40.798 align:start position:0%
convi con if you con uh commit two
 
05:09:43.070 --> 05:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
hunting violations within a 5-year
 
05:09:44.788 --> 05:09:44.798 align:start position:0%
period you will lose your license for 3
 
05:09:46.590 --> 05:09:46.600 align:start position:0%
years but we don't have anything beyond
 
05:09:49.990 --> 05:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
that so and we have a few that
 
05:09:53.788 --> 05:09:53.798 align:start position:0%
continually commit offenses um and so
 
05:09:55.548 --> 05:09:55.558 align:start position:0%
another thing we did in this bill was we
 
05:09:58.190 --> 05:09:58.200 align:start position:0%
talked about making a habitual offender
 
05:10:01.350 --> 05:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
status to address that very thing um as
 
05:10:03.430 --> 05:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
I said we don't have a lot of it but the
 
05:10:05.990 --> 05:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
ones that you do have you want to you I
 
05:10:07.750 --> 05:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
want to hit them harder because they
 
05:10:09.868 --> 05:10:09.878 align:start position:0%
don't either don't care and they're not
 
05:10:12.548 --> 05:10:12.558 align:start position:0%
going to change their behavior um or
 
05:10:13.948 --> 05:10:13.958 align:start position:0%
they haven't learned anything and they
 
05:10:15.590 --> 05:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
we really need to get their attention so
 
05:10:17.788 --> 05:10:17.798 align:start position:0%
this turns into an habitual offender
 
05:10:19.670 --> 05:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
status which makes it a misdemeanor for
 
05:10:21.948 --> 05:10:21.958 align:start position:0%
them to do that it also would open the
 
05:10:23.750 --> 05:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity for jail now I think we all
 
05:10:26.470 --> 05:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
know I can't get drug dealers locked up
 
05:10:28.350 --> 05:10:28.360 align:start position:0%
today it's just not the way it works
 
05:10:30.868 --> 05:10:30.878 align:start position:0%
anymore it's sad but that's the truth so
 
05:10:32.150 --> 05:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
I don't know how many of these people
 
05:10:34.510 --> 05:10:34.520 align:start position:0%
we'd put in jail but we certainly a
 
05:10:35.868 --> 05:10:35.878 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor offense gives them a
 
05:10:38.150 --> 05:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
criminal record uh gives us the ability
 
05:10:39.830 --> 05:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
to find them more
 
05:10:41.910 --> 05:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
um it it brings it to a whole new level
 
05:10:43.310 --> 05:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
and I'm hopeful that that would be a
 
05:10:47.270 --> 05:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
deterrent against future um activities
 
05:10:49.830 --> 05:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
so we don't have as I said good the good
 
05:10:51.150 --> 05:10:51.160 align:start position:0%
news is we don't have a lot of that but
 
05:10:52.670 --> 05:10:52.680 align:start position:0%
we do have some and I want to have a
 
05:10:55.590 --> 05:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
tool uh to be able to address it all of
 
05:10:55.600 --> 05:10:56.788 align:start position:0%
tool uh to be able to address it all of
the

05:10:56.788 --> 05:10:56.798 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:10:59.990 --> 05:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
hearing um rights would still exist they
 
05:11:01.708 --> 05:11:01.718 align:start position:0%
will always give them the opportunity to
 
05:11:03.070 --> 05:11:03.080 align:start position:0%
come in and have a hearing before the
 
05:11:04.628 --> 05:11:04.638 align:start position:0%
director the Attorney General wants us
 
05:11:07.110 --> 05:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
to do that and we've always done that so
 
05:11:08.510 --> 05:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
we would continue it in this but there
 
05:11:11.750 --> 05:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
would be an enhanced penalty for
 
05:11:13.868 --> 05:11:13.878 align:start position:0%
that that's all I
 
05:11:16.788 --> 05:11:16.798 align:start position:0%
have representative
 
05:11:19.750 --> 05:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
Khan thank you Mr chairman thank you con
 
05:11:23.310 --> 05:11:23.320 align:start position:0%
Jordan for taking my question uh
 
05:11:24.670 --> 05:11:24.680 align:start position:0%
question number
 
05:11:28.910 --> 05:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
one is it possible that uh Fish and Game
 
05:11:32.270 --> 05:11:32.280 align:start position:0%
Commission and fish and game department
 
05:11:34.910 --> 05:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
both supporting this Bill yes I and I
 
05:11:36.670 --> 05:11:36.680 align:start position:0%
apologize I didn't say that yes a
 
05:11:38.310 --> 05:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
commissioner actually brought brought it
 
05:11:40.190 --> 05:11:40.200 align:start position:0%
but the commission voted unanimously to
 
05:11:42.910 --> 05:11:42.920 align:start position:0%
support it and we work together on it
 
05:11:46.750 --> 05:11:46.760 align:start position:0%
followup followup thank you Mr chairman
 
05:11:50.470 --> 05:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
uh Colonel Jordan please tell us that uh
 
05:11:52.510 --> 05:11:52.520 align:start position:0%
the violations you know that how big is
 
05:11:55.510 --> 05:11:55.520 align:start position:0%
the problem for your department to face
 
05:11:58.350 --> 05:11:58.360 align:start position:0%
the violation at The Hunting violations
 
05:12:00.990 --> 05:12:01.000 align:start position:0%
that we just like to know that if it is
 
05:12:05.310 --> 05:12:05.320 align:start position:0%
more in 2024 then 2023 if you give us
 
05:12:08.230 --> 05:12:08.240 align:start position:0%
little history so it's interesting
 
05:12:10.670 --> 05:12:10.680 align:start position:0%
because we the dinosaurs over there we
 
05:12:12.190 --> 05:12:12.200 align:start position:0%
did things a little differently when we
 
05:12:13.750 --> 05:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
were in the field we made a lot of cases
 
05:12:15.628 --> 05:12:15.638 align:start position:0%
I made a lot of cases I I liked
 
05:12:17.948 --> 05:12:17.958 align:start position:0%
investigations and I we did it kind of
 
05:12:20.390 --> 05:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
the oldfashioned way uh by sitting in
 
05:12:22.070 --> 05:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
fields at night and waiting for people
 
05:12:23.590 --> 05:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
to shoot out the windows or light up
 
05:12:25.548 --> 05:12:25.558 align:start position:0%
deer light up Fields what I'm finding
 
05:12:28.110 --> 05:12:28.120 align:start position:0%
with this new generation is their their
 
05:12:30.110 --> 05:12:30.120 align:start position:0%
savviness with technology is much
 
05:12:32.590 --> 05:12:32.600 align:start position:0%
greater than mine and they are making
 
05:12:34.708 --> 05:12:34.718 align:start position:0%
cases that we would never these guys
 
05:12:36.270 --> 05:12:36.280 align:start position:0%
don't like to admit it but I will admit
 
05:12:37.788 --> 05:12:37.798 align:start position:0%
it they're making cases we never would
 
05:12:39.708 --> 05:12:39.718 align:start position:0%
have made and they're doing through cell
 
05:12:41.430 --> 05:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
phone technology they're doing it with
 
05:12:43.070 --> 05:12:43.080 align:start position:0%
search warrants searching cell phones
 
05:12:45.230 --> 05:12:45.240 align:start position:0%
because the good thing about criminals
 
05:12:47.628 --> 05:12:47.638 align:start position:0%
today they can't help themselves they
 
05:12:49.270 --> 05:12:49.280 align:start position:0%
take pictures and they text their
 
05:12:51.390 --> 05:12:51.400 align:start position:0%
buddies and they post this stuff and God
 
05:12:53.350 --> 05:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
bless them that's how they get caught
 
05:12:56.670 --> 05:12:56.680 align:start position:0%
and so I've got guys now trained men and
 
05:12:58.990 --> 05:12:59.000 align:start position:0%
women trained to go into cell phones
 
05:13:00.548 --> 05:13:00.558 align:start position:0%
after securing a search warrant and
 
05:13:02.590 --> 05:13:02.600 align:start position:0%
seizing those phones based on probable
 
05:13:04.948 --> 05:13:04.958 align:start position:0%
cause to go into those cell phones and
 
05:13:07.390 --> 05:13:07.400 align:start position:0%
we're finding we're making cases that
 
05:13:10.030 --> 05:13:10.040 align:start position:0%
are three and four years old old so
 
05:13:14.470 --> 05:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
there this year we were up uh we we also
 
05:13:17.590 --> 05:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
decided to start publicizing some of
 
05:13:19.910 --> 05:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
those cases a little more this year so
 
05:13:22.190 --> 05:13:22.200 align:start position:0%
we we weren't doing that and that's a d
 
05:13:24.070 --> 05:13:24.080 align:start position:0%
that can be a double-edged sword when
 
05:13:27.230 --> 05:13:27.240 align:start position:0%
you do that um to post when people
 
05:13:28.670 --> 05:13:28.680 align:start position:0%
commit these offenses but we've been
 
05:13:30.470 --> 05:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
encouraged by my commission to start
 
05:13:32.670 --> 05:13:32.680 align:start position:0%
doing that so we've done it kind of on a
 
05:13:34.270 --> 05:13:34.280 align:start position:0%
careful basis I've done it with more of
 
05:13:37.150 --> 05:13:37.160 align:start position:0%
the serious offenders cuz remember
 
05:13:39.150 --> 05:13:39.160 align:start position:0%
people make mistakes you know on a
 
05:13:41.270 --> 05:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
occasion it's a true mistake and so I
 
05:13:43.270 --> 05:13:43.280 align:start position:0%
don't want to punish people in their
 
05:13:45.270 --> 05:13:45.280 align:start position:0%
reputation and cost them their job
 
05:13:47.670 --> 05:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
because they made a mistake however
 
05:13:49.628 --> 05:13:49.638 align:start position:0%
people that are hardcore poachers and we
 
05:13:52.070 --> 05:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
have them uh that are killing animals I
 
05:13:54.110 --> 05:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
can think of a big case we made this
 
05:13:55.670 --> 05:13:55.680 align:start position:0%
year with a bunch of Corrections
 
05:13:57.788 --> 05:13:57.798 align:start position:0%
Officers that were lieutenants
 
05:14:00.548 --> 05:14:00.558 align:start position:0%
repeatedly shooting animals at night and
 
05:14:01.948 --> 05:14:01.958 align:start position:0%
doing things in the prison that we
 
05:14:03.590 --> 05:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
uncovered and so they ended up losing
 
05:14:05.868 --> 05:14:05.878 align:start position:0%
their jobs it was a huge case that is a
 
05:14:08.430 --> 05:14:08.440 align:start position:0%
case that we did publicize because I
 
05:14:10.470 --> 05:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
think that should out there that they no
 
05:14:11.910 --> 05:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
you know they didn't get a pass they
 
05:14:15.350 --> 05:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
were handled uh severely because their
 
05:14:17.350 --> 05:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
damage to the wildlife was
 
05:14:20.868 --> 05:14:20.878 align:start position:0%
significant um so I would I I'm not
 
05:14:22.948 --> 05:14:22.958 align:start position:0%
ready to say it's on the increase I do
 
05:14:25.150 --> 05:14:25.160 align:start position:0%
think we're making more of them because
 
05:14:26.990 --> 05:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
I think I have a smarter Field Force
 
05:14:29.070 --> 05:14:29.080 align:start position:0%
frankly I think they're sharper at this
 
05:14:30.830 --> 05:14:30.840 align:start position:0%
than we were and they're doing a better
 
05:14:33.310 --> 05:14:33.320 align:start position:0%
job so we're they're they're hungry for
 
05:14:35.510 --> 05:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
it and they're making a lot of cases
 
05:14:38.350 --> 05:14:38.360 align:start position:0%
this will will be a great tool for them
 
05:14:40.270 --> 05:14:40.280 align:start position:0%
uh to to to punish people hold them
 
05:14:43.230 --> 05:14:43.240 align:start position:0%
accountable so again it's not our job to
 
05:14:44.830 --> 05:14:44.840 align:start position:0%
punish people I think officers lose
 
05:14:46.310 --> 05:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
sight of that it's our job to change the
 
05:14:48.670 --> 05:14:48.680 align:start position:0%
behavior and uh and if you can do that
 
05:14:50.150 --> 05:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
with a warning that's the better way to
 
05:14:51.948 --> 05:14:51.958 align:start position:0%
do it but if you can't then you issue a
 
05:14:54.270 --> 05:14:54.280 align:start position:0%
summons and and we let the court punish
 
05:14:57.868 --> 05:14:57.878 align:start position:0%
them thank you representative
 
05:15:00.990 --> 05:15:01.000 align:start position:0%
Harvey so let me ask the question I
 
05:15:03.470 --> 05:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
asked the chairman only I'll ask it yes
 
05:15:07.788 --> 05:15:07.798 align:start position:0%
ma'am in your words yes um if we raised
 
05:15:12.070 --> 05:15:12.080 align:start position:0%
the um amount for Fisher and fox
 
05:15:14.750 --> 05:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
especially to a thousand instead of 500
 
05:15:17.390 --> 05:15:17.400 align:start position:0%
because those animals are on the decline
 
05:15:19.830 --> 05:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire would that
 
05:15:19.840 --> 05:15:22.030 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire would that
change

05:15:22.030 --> 05:15:22.040 align:start position:0%
change
 
05:15:24.150 --> 05:15:24.160 align:start position:0%
Behavior I don't know that I could say
 
05:15:27.230 --> 05:15:27.240 align:start position:0%
it would change behavior um I think you
 
05:15:29.030 --> 05:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
could make an argument that they're
 
05:15:31.070 --> 05:15:31.080 align:start position:0%
they're because what we get into is
 
05:15:32.590 --> 05:15:32.600 align:start position:0%
arguing the value of animals and
 
05:15:33.868 --> 05:15:33.878 align:start position:0%
everybody has a different opinion there
 
05:15:35.628 --> 05:15:35.638 align:start position:0%
are I can find people that'll tell you a
 
05:15:37.350 --> 05:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
wild turkeyy is worth twice what you're
 
05:15:41.070 --> 05:15:41.080 align:start position:0%
asking or a deer is worth a lot more um
 
05:15:42.830 --> 05:15:42.840 align:start position:0%
as long as it doesn't derail the
 
05:15:44.510 --> 05:15:44.520 align:start position:0%
progress of the bill I I would like to
 
05:15:46.070 --> 05:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
get the bill through I think it's
 
05:15:48.628 --> 05:15:48.638 align:start position:0%
important to get it through um I don't
 
05:15:50.470 --> 05:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
believe I don't I would not have any
 
05:15:51.990 --> 05:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
objection to that I have not run it by
 
05:15:53.590 --> 05:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
my commission but I would not have an
 
05:15:55.948 --> 05:15:55.958 align:start position:0%
objection to that their idea was to pick
 
05:15:58.190 --> 05:15:58.200 align:start position:0%
these these amounts up to make them more
 
05:16:02.390 --> 05:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
modern um so that's my answer to that
 
05:16:06.230 --> 05:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
05:16:08.510 --> 05:16:08.520 align:start position:0%
Durkin thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:16:11.350 --> 05:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
Colonel for yes sir question um I was
 
05:16:13.430 --> 05:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
looking through this amendment this uh
 
05:16:15.628 --> 05:16:15.638 align:start position:0%
uh some of your introductions here on
 
05:16:18.230 --> 05:16:18.240 align:start position:0%
the restitution on the second page there
 
05:16:20.070 --> 05:16:20.080 align:start position:0%
yes uh regarding the payment to the
 
05:16:22.310 --> 05:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
court um if they are guilty contempt
 
05:16:24.910 --> 05:16:24.920 align:start position:0%
such person shall not be negligible to
 
05:16:27.230 --> 05:16:27.240 align:start position:0%
purchase any uh license issued by the
 
05:16:29.190 --> 05:16:29.200 align:start position:0%
fishing game until all assets are paid
 
05:16:32.310 --> 05:16:32.320 align:start position:0%
in full yes would it be a good idea to
 
05:16:34.590 --> 05:16:34.600 align:start position:0%
maybe add you know penalty of interest
 
05:16:36.270 --> 05:16:36.280 align:start position:0%
if they're not paid in a timely manner
 
05:16:39.230 --> 05:16:39.240 align:start position:0%
or I don't think we can charge interest
 
05:16:41.868 --> 05:16:41.878 align:start position:0%
I would be all in favor of that but I
 
05:16:43.788 --> 05:16:43.798 align:start position:0%
well the penalty is the so what they
 
05:16:45.990 --> 05:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
would be uh one thing this bill doesn't
 
05:16:47.548 --> 05:16:47.558 align:start position:0%
do because it already exis in law they
 
05:16:49.868 --> 05:16:49.878 align:start position:0%
would go into into court default because
 
05:16:51.548 --> 05:16:51.558 align:start position:0%
this would be a court order so when you
 
05:16:53.430 --> 05:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
failed to pay a court order or you
 
05:16:55.310 --> 05:16:55.320 align:start position:0%
failed to abide by a court order you go
 
05:16:57.750 --> 05:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
into default and they charge a penalty
 
05:16:59.390 --> 05:16:59.400 align:start position:0%
they charge that fee so they would have
 
05:17:02.350 --> 05:17:02.360 align:start position:0%
to pay I believe $100 the motor
 
05:17:04.270 --> 05:17:04.280 align:start position:0%
vehicle because they would lose their
 
05:17:06.750 --> 05:17:06.760 align:start position:0%
driver's license they have to pay $50 to
 
05:17:09.548 --> 05:17:09.558 align:start position:0%
us on top of any and all Court fines and
 
05:17:11.470 --> 05:17:11.480 align:start position:0%
restitutions so they get charged that
 
05:17:12.948 --> 05:17:12.958 align:start position:0%
through the court I don't think we can
 
05:17:15.628 --> 05:17:15.638 align:start position:0%
do that but the courts can I I will tell
 
05:17:17.070 --> 05:17:17.080 align:start position:0%
you another interesting thing coming out
 
05:17:19.350 --> 05:17:19.360 align:start position:0%
of the Dark Ages with our our licensing
 
05:17:22.110 --> 05:17:22.120 align:start position:0%
and internet for years you could buy a
 
05:17:23.590 --> 05:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
if you went under suspension in New
 
05:17:25.750 --> 05:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for hunting you could go to
 
05:17:27.590 --> 05:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
Walmart if they didn't know who you were
 
05:17:29.070 --> 05:17:29.080 align:start position:0%
you could buy a hunting license and our
 
05:17:30.310 --> 05:17:30.320 align:start position:0%
system allowed them to do it was
 
05:17:32.470 --> 05:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
ridiculous I scream for years that that
 
05:17:34.430 --> 05:17:34.440 align:start position:0%
should change and in order to do that we
 
05:17:36.670 --> 05:17:36.680 align:start position:0%
had to revamp our licensing system
 
05:17:39.628 --> 05:17:39.638 align:start position:0%
online Kathy uh through many meetings
 
05:17:41.990 --> 05:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
with Kathy lebani that you who you met
 
05:17:44.868 --> 05:17:44.878 align:start position:0%
this morning we were able to do that uh
 
05:17:46.670 --> 05:17:46.680 align:start position:0%
just recently that one online and those
 
05:17:48.910 --> 05:17:48.920 align:start position:0%
poor girls in my office are taking call
 
05:17:51.590 --> 05:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
after call after call people back in the
 
05:17:54.830 --> 05:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
90s that went under suspension default
 
05:17:56.190 --> 05:17:56.200 align:start position:0%
and have been buying licenses right
 
05:17:59.270 --> 05:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
along and now they can't and so on
 
05:18:01.548 --> 05:18:01.558 align:start position:0%
January 1st we we were inundated with
 
05:18:02.708 --> 05:18:02.718 align:start position:0%
calls because people wanted to buy
 
05:18:04.708 --> 05:18:04.718 align:start position:0%
fishing licenses go out and fish and the
 
05:18:06.110 --> 05:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
system wouldn't let them do it anymore
 
05:18:07.628 --> 05:18:07.638 align:start position:0%
so that was a good move kind of gave you
 
05:18:08.948 --> 05:18:08.958 align:start position:0%
an idea how many people were out they
 
05:18:10.868 --> 05:18:10.878 align:start position:0%
still doing it so I think we've
 
05:18:15.670 --> 05:18:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:19.708 --> 05:18:19.718 align:start position:0%
help any other questions for Colonel
 
05:18:23.670 --> 05:18:23.680 align:start position:0%

05:18:47.230 --> 05:18:47.240 align:start position:0%
not like we got 100,000 wild turkey in

the
 
05:18:52.030 --> 05:18:52.040 align:start position:0%
state it should be a thousand on
 
05:18:58.708 --> 05:18:58.718 align:start position:0%

05:20:05.430 --> 05:20:05.440 align:start position:0%

County I'm also chairman of the fishing
 
05:20:15.788 --> 05:20:15.798 align:start position:0%
game and Marine Resources committee um I
 
05:20:18.548 --> 05:20:18.558 align:start position:0%
was the one who brought this follow I am
 
05:20:22.110 --> 05:20:22.120 align:start position:0%
the one who is responsible for this and
 
05:20:24.990 --> 05:20:25.000 align:start position:0%
I'll give keep it very brief this came
 
05:20:27.430 --> 05:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
about because of one day there was a
 
05:20:31.628 --> 05:20:31.638 align:start position:0%
news article in a paper in Milford about
 
05:20:33.510 --> 05:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
a family that had gone out and was
 
05:20:37.390 --> 05:20:37.400 align:start position:0%
caught for poaching deer and this was
 
05:20:39.948 --> 05:20:39.958 align:start position:0%
their numerous times of poaching the
 
05:20:43.190 --> 05:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
deer and I received over a period of
 
05:20:45.910 --> 05:20:45.920 align:start position:0%
three days of that newspaper
 
05:20:50.990 --> 05:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
article 48 phone calls from constituents
 
05:20:53.990 --> 05:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
saying something has to be done about
 
05:20:57.150 --> 05:20:57.160 align:start position:0%
this out of those phone calls that came
 
05:21:00.350 --> 05:21:00.360 align:start position:0%
I think I received six phone calls from
 
05:21:03.230 --> 05:21:03.240 align:start position:0%
their own family
 
05:21:06.430 --> 05:21:06.440 align:start position:0%
members out of the 148 phone calls from
 
05:21:08.788 --> 05:21:08.798 align:start position:0%
the people that I spoke to at least 100
 
05:21:12.548 --> 05:21:12.558 align:start position:0%
did said it's time for jail for these
 
05:21:16.150 --> 05:21:16.160 align:start position:0%
people I went to fishing game obviously
 
05:21:19.470 --> 05:21:19.480 align:start position:0%
as a commissioner and I says it's time
 
05:21:22.628 --> 05:21:22.638 align:start position:0%
we have to relook at the
 
05:21:25.310 --> 05:21:25.320 align:start position:0%
poaching as you can see on the fines
 
05:21:28.070 --> 05:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
that used to be there I believe my
 
05:21:31.190 --> 05:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
comment to the colonel was the poaching
 
05:21:33.190 --> 05:21:33.200 align:start position:0%
fines are like going to wends and
 
05:21:35.590 --> 05:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
looking at their dollar
 
05:21:41.350 --> 05:21:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:43.628 --> 05:21:43.638 align:start position:0%
say come down hot on somebody the reason
 
05:21:45.708 --> 05:21:45.718 align:start position:0%
of doing this was we were trying to do
 
05:21:47.110 --> 05:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
it as a
 
05:21:50.628 --> 05:21:50.638 align:start position:0%
deterrent against poaching we understand
 
05:21:53.070 --> 05:21:53.080 align:start position:0%
there are people that will make a
 
05:21:55.948 --> 05:21:55.958 align:start position:0%
mistake so it wasn't a matter of the
 
05:21:57.230 --> 05:21:57.240 align:start position:0%
first time
 
05:22:00.470 --> 05:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
somebody ran into a poaching situation
 
05:22:03.190 --> 05:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
that they're going off to jail we were
 
05:22:06.390 --> 05:22:06.400 align:start position:0%
going after the repeat offenders that
 
05:22:09.230 --> 05:22:09.240 align:start position:0%
are constantly out there
 
05:22:11.830 --> 05:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
poaching animals regardless of what
 
05:22:14.548 --> 05:22:14.558 align:start position:0%
happens when it came down to the fines
 
05:22:17.510 --> 05:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
our poaching was beginning to look kind
 
05:22:20.230 --> 05:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
of like on the couple of years back on
 
05:22:24.190 --> 05:22:24.200 align:start position:0%
the snowb bill fine get a $25 fine
 
05:22:26.910 --> 05:22:26.920 align:start position:0%
people were looking to get it to say
 
05:22:31.030 --> 05:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
they got a trophy of a $25
 
05:22:34.430 --> 05:22:34.440 align:start position:0%
fine I when I first went to the colonel
 
05:22:37.070 --> 05:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
my findes that I had recommended a lot
 
05:22:37.080 --> 05:22:38.708 align:start position:0%
my findes that I had recommended a lot
higher

05:22:38.708 --> 05:22:38.718 align:start position:0%
higher
 
05:22:41.510 --> 05:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
what like you representative a you're
 
05:22:44.470 --> 05:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
saying the problem that we had with that
 
05:22:47.470 --> 05:22:47.480 align:start position:0%
which I understand is if we came in with
 
05:22:50.350 --> 05:22:50.360 align:start position:0%
the fines especially matching some
 
05:22:54.150 --> 05:22:54.160 align:start position:0%
states out west we felt that
 
05:22:58.430 --> 05:22:58.440 align:start position:0%
it it had hurt the bill is what we
 
05:23:01.070 --> 05:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
thought we wanted the bill that came in
 
05:23:04.190 --> 05:23:04.200 align:start position:0%
here that was clean a bill that was
 
05:23:07.430 --> 05:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
understandable this bill was
 
05:23:10.070 --> 05:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
based kind of on the understanding if
 
05:23:13.990 --> 05:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
you think of the DWI law in the state if
 
05:23:15.788 --> 05:23:15.798 align:start position:0%
you go out and do it three times in a
 
05:23:18.548 --> 05:23:18.558 align:start position:0%
row you become an habitual offender you
 
05:23:21.030 --> 05:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
do it again you're going to
 
05:23:23.910 --> 05:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
jail originally fishing game could only
 
05:23:26.390 --> 05:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
do penalties up until I believe it was
 
05:23:29.948 --> 05:23:29.958 align:start position:0%
four years the driver's license is
 
05:23:32.470 --> 05:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
seven you know the state can go back
 
05:23:35.310 --> 05:23:35.320 align:start position:0%
seven years on your driver's license why
 
05:23:38.628 --> 05:23:38.638 align:start position:0%
can't fishing game go back seven years
 
05:23:41.350 --> 05:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
on game violations so that's why the
 
05:23:44.350 --> 05:23:44.360 align:start position:0%
seven years came in there I personally
 
05:23:47.750 --> 05:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
went out and spoke to judges on this on
 
05:23:49.708 --> 05:23:49.718 align:start position:0%
where the language in there has been
 
05:23:53.350 --> 05:23:53.360 align:start position:0%
changed to instead of a judge May to
 
05:23:54.708 --> 05:23:54.718 align:start position:0%
where the judge
 
05:23:57.590 --> 05:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
shall and that situation was when a
 
05:24:00.830 --> 05:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
judge is handing out violations and
 
05:24:03.868 --> 05:24:03.878 align:start position:0%
penalties in the courtroom he likes to
 
05:24:06.628 --> 05:24:06.638 align:start position:0%
he or she likes to be the nice
 
05:24:09.190 --> 05:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
person oh I'll charge your fine but I'll
 
05:24:13.430 --> 05:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
wave the penalty or I'll lower the fine
 
05:24:15.910 --> 05:24:15.920 align:start position:0%
I'll drop the
 
05:24:18.390 --> 05:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
penalty this way here the judge has
 
05:24:20.708 --> 05:24:20.718 align:start position:0%
taken off the hook they agree with it if
 
05:24:24.788 --> 05:24:24.798 align:start position:0%
that law says I have to they have
 
05:24:27.868 --> 05:24:27.878 align:start position:0%
to as far as going and changing the
 
05:24:30.030 --> 05:24:30.040 align:start position:0%
fines when I sat down with the colonel
 
05:24:32.670 --> 05:24:32.680 align:start position:0%
and the major I think we came up with I
 
05:24:36.070 --> 05:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
would have had to change 87 different
 
05:24:36.080 --> 05:24:38.990 align:start position:0%
would have had to change 87 different
rsas

05:24:38.990 --> 05:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
rsas
 
05:24:40.868 --> 05:24:40.878 align:start position:0%
if I were to walk in here with a bill
 
05:24:44.310 --> 05:24:44.320 align:start position:0%
that says change 87 rsas I bet you to go
 
05:24:46.788 --> 05:24:46.798 align:start position:0%
LTL nobody's going to take the time to
 
05:24:49.430 --> 05:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
look at it there was a lot of thought in
 
05:24:53.030 --> 05:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
this we spent over a year on this to
 
05:24:58.150 --> 05:24:58.160 align:start position:0%
make it fair and use it as a deterrent
 
05:24:58.160 --> 05:24:59.948 align:start position:0%
make it fair and use it as a deterrent
towards

05:24:59.948 --> 05:24:59.958 align:start position:0%
towards
 
05:25:02.430 --> 05:25:02.440 align:start position:0%
poaching I know you've all have seen the
 
05:25:05.750 --> 05:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
Articles lately in papers this also
 
05:25:08.430 --> 05:25:08.440 align:start position:0%
covers Us throughout the whole state and
 
05:25:11.350 --> 05:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
it also goes into with our marine life
 
05:25:13.150 --> 05:25:13.160 align:start position:0%
where when you just saw the recent thing
 
05:25:14.948 --> 05:25:14.958 align:start position:0%
on the amount of stripers that were
 
05:25:16.110 --> 05:25:16.120 align:start position:0%
taken over
 
05:25:18.510 --> 05:25:18.520 align:start position:0%
limit so there was a lot of thought lot
 
05:25:20.708 --> 05:25:20.718 align:start position:0%
of work that went into this we're trying
 
05:25:23.350 --> 05:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
to beef Fair would I want to see those
 
05:25:27.470 --> 05:25:27.480 align:start position:0%
finds higher oh yes
 
05:25:29.708 --> 05:25:29.718 align:start position:0%
yes but I don't want to take the chance
 
05:25:33.070 --> 05:25:33.080 align:start position:0%
of ruining what I call a good bill
 
05:25:42.788 --> 05:25:42.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:45.670 --> 05:25:45.680 align:start position:0%
no questions for our
 
05:25:48.070 --> 05:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner thank you very much thank
 
05:25:55.230 --> 05:25:55.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:58.310 --> 05:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
time that'll close that closes our
 
05:26:05.110 --> 05:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:08.868 --> 05:26:08.878 align:start position:0%
FN representative Harvey so uh you can
 
05:26:10.350 --> 05:26:10.360 align:start position:0%
let me know if I'm out of line I don't
 
05:26:12.590 --> 05:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
know if this is the right time but I I
 
05:26:14.110 --> 05:26:14.120 align:start position:0%
would like to bring in an amendment that
 
05:26:16.270 --> 05:26:16.280 align:start position:0%
does raise that line to $1,000 your
 
05:26:18.510 --> 05:26:18.520 align:start position:0%
timing is impeccable oh I was just about
 
05:26:19.750 --> 05:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
to announce to the committee that if
 
05:26:21.830 --> 05:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
they have any personal opinions on
 
05:26:23.270 --> 05:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
something that should change in the bill
 
05:26:25.788 --> 05:26:25.798 align:start position:0%
a different number or whatever feel free
 
05:26:28.628 --> 05:26:28.638 align:start position:0%
to bring an amendment to next week okay
 
05:26:30.150 --> 05:26:30.160 align:start position:0%
because we're already going to be doing
 
05:26:32.990 --> 05:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
a public hearing on the other amendment
 
05:26:35.548 --> 05:26:35.558 align:start position:0%
to this bill that's non-
 
05:26:37.788 --> 05:26:37.798 align:start position:0%
gerain and we won't be executing this
 
05:26:41.708 --> 05:26:41.718 align:start position:0%
until next week okay so keep in mind
 
05:26:44.788 --> 05:26:44.798 align:start position:0%
every Amendment will have to be offered
 
05:26:47.910 --> 05:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
voted on and then may or may not affect
 
05:26:50.070 --> 05:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
the bill oh I I understand the process I
 
05:26:51.390 --> 05:26:51.400 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make sure it was okay to
 
05:26:53.310 --> 05:26:53.320 align:start position:0%
do it but every member has the right to
 
05:26:54.708 --> 05:26:54.718 align:start position:0%
go and pull an amendment if they feel
 
05:26:58.310 --> 05:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
like it and offer it up during exec once
 
05:27:00.430 --> 05:27:00.440 align:start position:0%
the Bill's open for Amendment okay thank
 
05:27:06.230 --> 05:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:10.470 --> 05:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
that and we have about a 5 minute
 
05:27:13.150 --> 05:27:13.160 align:start position:0%
break minutes oh no 20 minutes sorry I
 
05:27:15.990 --> 05:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
set that one 45 minutes thought it might
 
05:27:18.190 --> 05:27:18.200 align:start position:0%
take longer you never
 
05:27:20.190 --> 05:27:20.200 align:start position:0%
know I thought there'd be a lot of
 
05:27:21.948 --> 05:27:21.958 align:start position:0%
people objecting to the Fine
 
05:27:48.720 --> 05:27:48.730 align:start position:0%

the written and oral exams are provided
 
05:53:30.628 --> 05:53:30.638 align:start position:0%
by Fish and Game officers after learning
 
05:53:32.628 --> 05:53:32.638 align:start position:0%

number 25-
 
05:53:47.910 --> 05:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
0745 which you should have in front of

following any required written or oral
 
05:53:56.910 --> 05:53:56.920 align:start position:0%

administered only by a fishing game
 
05:54:03.468 --> 05:54:03.478 align:start position:0%
officer this language just clarifies
 
05:54:06.390 --> 05:54:06.400 align:start position:0%
that the guide's test is authorized and
 
05:54:10.230 --> 05:54:10.240 align:start position:0%
conducted by fishing game officers
 
05:54:12.990 --> 05:54:13.000 align:start position:0%
only since this licensing is the
 
05:54:15.948 --> 05:54:15.958 align:start position:0%
responsibility of fishing game this is
 
05:54:18.548 --> 05:54:18.558 align:start position:0%
who the testing should be administered
 
05:54:20.990 --> 05:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
by after all when I want to get my
 
05:54:23.990 --> 05:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
driver's license I can take an exam
 
05:54:26.070 --> 05:54:26.080 align:start position:0%

05:54:45.040 --> 05:54:46.590 align:start position:0%
receive a consistent method of testing
thank

05:54:46.590 --> 05:54:46.600 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:54:48.948 --> 05:54:48.958 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative uh there
 
05:54:51.110 --> 05:54:51.120 align:start position:0%
are any
 
05:54:54.270 --> 05:54:54.280 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
05:54:58.390 --> 05:54:58.400 align:start position:0%
wette um looking at the bill and um
 
05:55:01.270 --> 05:55:01.280 align:start position:0%
under Part B that should be test should
 
05:55:03.468 --> 05:55:03.478 align:start position:0%
be got uh administered by a fishing game
 
05:55:05.788 --> 05:55:05.798 align:start position:0%
officer why is there no fiscal note
 
05:55:07.190 --> 05:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
because it's going to take our fishing
 
05:55:10.430 --> 05:55:10.440 align:start position:0%
game officers time and and uh there's a
 
05:55:13.510 --> 05:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
cost to it that's a good question but
 
05:55:15.670 --> 05:55:15.680 align:start position:0%
the the fishing game officers are
 
05:55:18.948 --> 05:55:18.958 align:start position:0%
already administering the written exam
 
05:55:21.270 --> 05:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
so why not just do the oral portion at
 
05:55:23.910 --> 05:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:25.910 --> 05:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
time representative
 
05:55:29.110 --> 05:55:29.120 align:start position:0%
Harvey uh so my question pertains to um
 
05:55:33.310 --> 05:55:33.320 align:start position:0%
section c um all questions questions and
 
05:55:34.590 --> 05:55:34.600 align:start position:0%
answers shall be made available in a
 
05:55:36.310 --> 05:55:36.320 align:start position:0%
study guide for examiners to review and
 
05:55:38.750 --> 05:55:38.760 align:start position:0%
study once an application is submitted
 
05:55:42.230 --> 05:55:42.240 align:start position:0%
are you suggesting that the exact
 
05:55:43.548 --> 05:55:43.558 align:start position:0%
questions and answers that are going to
 
05:55:47.270 --> 05:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
be on the test be in that study guide no
 
05:55:49.070 --> 05:55:49.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm not suggesting that but
 
05:55:50.788 --> 05:55:50.798 align:start position:0%
there should be questions that pertain
 
05:55:53.708 --> 05:55:53.718 align:start position:0%
to the exam when you're given a list of
 
05:55:59.708 --> 05:55:59.718 align:start position:0%
20 or so books to read um and um perhaps
 
05:56:01.350 --> 05:56:01.360 align:start position:0%
some of that information might be on the
 
05:56:03.628 --> 05:56:03.638 align:start position:0%
exam and maybe not be on the exam it's
 
05:56:06.548 --> 05:56:06.558 align:start position:0%
really difficult to study so if was
 
05:56:08.750 --> 05:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
something that was more ciled to the
 
05:56:11.310 --> 05:56:11.320 align:start position:0%
exam as to what they're expecting that
 
05:56:13.910 --> 05:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
would be a better situation those types
 
05:56:18.230 --> 05:56:18.240 align:start position:0%
of um items are available uh at in other
 
05:56:20.868 --> 05:56:20.878 align:start position:0%
at other fishing game uh guides programs
 
05:56:23.430 --> 05:56:23.440 align:start position:0%
so they do get some type of literature
 
05:56:26.990 --> 05:56:27.000 align:start position:0%
to to assist them may I have a followup
 
05:56:30.788 --> 05:56:30.798 align:start position:0%
please followup thank you um yes it it
 
05:56:32.430 --> 05:56:32.440 align:start position:0%
was my understanding when we saw this
 
05:56:35.390 --> 05:56:35.400 align:start position:0%
bill before that sample tests were put
 
05:56:40.270 --> 05:56:40.280 align:start position:0%
online but my other question then is
 
05:56:43.548 --> 05:56:43.558 align:start position:0%
um from the same section you're not are
 
05:56:46.350 --> 05:56:46.360 align:start position:0%
you are you suggesting that those
 
05:56:48.070 --> 05:56:48.080 align:start position:0%
questions and answers should not be
 
05:56:51.310 --> 05:56:51.320 align:start position:0%
changed on a regular basis that are used
 
05:56:53.390 --> 05:56:53.400 align:start position:0%
as a guide to review and study that in
 
05:56:56.390 --> 05:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
other words the study guide might change
 
05:56:58.548 --> 05:56:58.558 align:start position:0%
on a fairly regular basis are you
 
05:56:58.558 --> 05:57:00.390 align:start position:0%
on a fairly regular basis are you
suggesting

05:57:00.390 --> 05:57:00.400 align:start position:0%
suggesting
 
05:57:02.548 --> 05:57:02.558 align:start position:0%
otherwise like any test they are
 
05:57:04.830 --> 05:57:04.840 align:start position:0%
typically changed because you know if
 
05:57:08.350 --> 05:57:08.360 align:start position:0%
they're applying several times um so I'm
 
05:57:10.590 --> 05:57:10.600 align:start position:0%
not suggesting they have to be the same
 
05:57:13.830 --> 05:57:13.840 align:start position:0%
exact uh questions but it's should just
 
05:57:15.990 --> 05:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
think of um long time ago when you got
 
05:57:18.070 --> 05:57:18.080 align:start position:0%
your driver's license we got a book full
 
05:57:21.150 --> 05:57:21.160 align:start position:0%
of different scenarios and questions we
 
05:57:22.830 --> 05:57:22.840 align:start position:0%
weren't tested on all of them I think
 
05:57:25.510 --> 05:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
there was maybe 40 on that but we St
 
05:57:28.150 --> 05:57:28.160 align:start position:0%
there was a specific guide for that uh
 
05:57:30.548 --> 05:57:30.558 align:start position:0%
should we know all of it perhaps that
 
05:57:33.150 --> 05:57:33.160 align:start position:0%
would be helpful when we're driving but
 
05:57:35.110 --> 05:57:35.120 align:start position:0%
um that doesn't mean all of that is on
 
05:57:37.070 --> 05:57:37.080 align:start position:0%
the actual exam we're just looking for a
 
05:57:40.110 --> 05:57:40.120 align:start position:0%
standardized approach so it's not one
 
05:57:42.190 --> 05:57:42.200 align:start position:0%
method for one individual and a
 
05:57:46.390 --> 05:57:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:50.868 --> 05:57:50.878 align:start position:0%
else representa Pearson thank you it
 
05:57:54.430 --> 05:57:54.440 align:start position:0%
says here in um the B
 
05:57:58.350 --> 05:57:58.360 align:start position:0%
section that all uh written and oral
 
05:58:00.590 --> 05:58:00.600 align:start position:0%
examinations be become a guide shall be
 
05:58:02.910 --> 05:58:02.920 align:start position:0%
administered by a fishing game officer
 
05:58:05.030 --> 05:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
who is also a licensed guide in New
 
05:58:06.628 --> 05:58:06.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire MH
 
05:58:08.468 --> 05:58:08.478 align:start position:0%
how many fish and game officers are
 
05:58:11.310 --> 05:58:11.320 align:start position:0%
licensed guides I don't believe any of
 
05:58:13.150 --> 05:58:13.160 align:start position:0%
them are and that's why I have the
 
05:58:15.670 --> 05:58:15.680 align:start position:0%
amendment I took that language
 
05:58:19.150 --> 05:58:19.160 align:start position:0%
out oh I see I'm sorry my apologies
 
05:58:19.160 --> 05:58:20.788 align:start position:0%
out oh I see I'm sorry my apologies
thank

05:58:20.788 --> 05:58:20.798 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:58:23.468 --> 05:58:23.478 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
05:58:25.468 --> 05:58:25.478 align:start position:0%
DeVito um thank you for taking my
 
05:58:27.788 --> 05:58:27.798 align:start position:0%
question have you ever been out hunting
 
05:58:30.670 --> 05:58:30.680 align:start position:0%
with a guide a licensed guide here in
 
05:58:34.150 --> 05:58:34.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I have not I am I am here
 
05:58:36.670 --> 05:58:36.680 align:start position:0%
uh representing constituents from
 
05:58:38.788 --> 05:58:38.798 align:start position:0%
several uh locations that have reached
 
05:58:41.430 --> 05:58:41.440 align:start position:0%
out to me uh there are a couple that are
 
05:58:44.230 --> 05:58:44.240 align:start position:0%
here uh that are brave enough to be here
 
05:58:46.868 --> 05:58:46.878 align:start position:0%
so um but that I've been reached out to
 
05:58:50.670 --> 05:58:50.680 align:start position:0%
by email and phone calls and um there's
 
05:58:52.628 --> 05:58:52.638 align:start position:0%
a lot of discussion about this bill
 
05:58:55.310 --> 05:58:55.320 align:start position:0%
people that have been applying year
 
05:58:58.190 --> 05:58:58.200 align:start position:0%
after year after year they'll pass that
 
05:59:00.750 --> 05:59:00.760 align:start position:0%
written test fine and it comes to that
 
05:59:03.590 --> 05:59:03.600 align:start position:0%
oral examination that's provided
 
05:59:06.430 --> 05:59:06.440 align:start position:0%
currently by a guide who own owns a
 
05:59:06.440 --> 05:59:07.310 align:start position:0%
currently by a guide who own owns a
guide

05:59:07.310 --> 05:59:07.320 align:start position:0%
guide
 
05:59:10.310 --> 05:59:10.320 align:start position:0%
business and they typically fail which
 
05:59:14.590 --> 05:59:14.600 align:start position:0%
then they fail to receive a license so
 
05:59:16.390 --> 05:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
there's something that's that doesn't
 
05:59:18.628 --> 05:59:18.638 align:start position:0%
balance out there we're just asking that
 
05:59:21.430 --> 05:59:21.440 align:start position:0%
fish and game take the responsibility of
 
05:59:24.628 --> 05:59:24.638 align:start position:0%
both portions of the
 
05:59:27.868 --> 05:59:27.878 align:start position:0%
exam representative Khan thank you Mr
 
05:59:30.110 --> 05:59:30.120 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you representative taking
 
05:59:32.788 --> 05:59:32.798 align:start position:0%
my question representative I'm just
 
05:59:36.030 --> 05:59:36.040 align:start position:0%
refreshing my memory didn't we uh
 
05:59:38.230 --> 05:59:38.240 align:start position:0%
discussed this bill at the last uh
 
05:59:41.830 --> 05:59:41.840 align:start position:0%
session and was it your bill Yes
 
05:59:44.830 --> 05:59:44.840 align:start position:0%
actually it was and so I have taken some
 
05:59:48.628 --> 05:59:48.638 align:start position:0%
con um constructive criticism and just
 
05:59:50.990 --> 05:59:51.000 align:start position:0%
kind of narrow it down to really what
 
05:59:54.190 --> 05:59:54.200 align:start position:0%
the issue is I think it's very simple to
 
05:59:56.670 --> 05:59:56.680 align:start position:0%
make this adjustment it won't cost
 
05:59:59.590 --> 05:59:59.600 align:start position:0%
fishing game additional funding um and I
 
06:00:01.750 --> 06:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
think it would be a fair assessment as
 
06:00:05.590 --> 06:00:05.600 align:start position:0%
to where the applicant stands thank you
 
06:00:05.600 --> 06:00:06.990 align:start position:0%
to where the applicant stands thank you
represent

06:00:06.990 --> 06:00:07.000 align:start position:0%
represent
 
06:00:09.070 --> 06:00:09.080 align:start position:0%
oulette thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
06:00:10.788 --> 06:00:10.798 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question what is the
 
06:00:13.948 --> 06:00:13.958 align:start position:0%
failure rate on the tests that I can't
 
06:00:15.670 --> 06:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
give you because that information is not
 
06:00:18.948 --> 06:00:18.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:21.708 --> 06:00:21.718 align:start position:0%
public any other
 
06:00:23.948 --> 06:00:23.958 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
06:00:28.548 --> 06:00:28.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:32.150 --> 06:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
all the chair now recognizes David
 
06:00:34.830 --> 06:00:34.840 align:start position:0%
P representing himself I assume because
 
06:01:34.830 --> 06:01:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:34.840 --> 06:02:04.830 align:start position:0%
 
e

06:02:04.830 --> 06:02:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:04.840 --> 06:02:34.830 align:start position:0%
 
e

06:02:34.830 --> 06:02:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:34.840 --> 06:03:04.750 align:start position:0%
 
e

06:03:04.750 --> 06:03:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:04.760 --> 06:03:34.708 align:start position:0%
 
e

06:03:34.708 --> 06:03:34.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:13.990 --> 06:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:16.310 --> 06:04:16.320 align:start position:0%
thank you sir any questions
 
06:04:17.750 --> 06:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
representative Harvey had her hand up
 
06:04:22.070 --> 06:04:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:24.430 --> 06:04:24.440 align:start position:0%
surprise um
 
06:04:24.440 --> 06:04:26.430 align:start position:0%
surprise um
so

06:04:26.430 --> 06:04:26.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:04:29.910 --> 06:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
um we heard testimony from the pre
 
06:04:32.548 --> 06:04:32.558 align:start position:0%
previous speakers that on the oral exams
 
06:04:34.788 --> 06:04:34.798 align:start position:0%
and that maybe that could be um on
 
06:04:38.150 --> 06:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
practicums that there could possibly be
 
06:04:42.750 --> 06:04:42.760 align:start position:0%
two answers um to a situation H how how
 
06:04:45.430 --> 06:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
do you how do you how do you deal with
 
06:04:48.070 --> 06:04:48.080 align:start position:0%
that like is one writer than the other
 
06:04:53.670 --> 06:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:55.868 --> 06:04:55.878 align:start position:0%
like can you turn the mic on by the way
 
06:05:01.468 --> 06:05:01.478 align:start position:0%
I just sorry uh we correct them as they
 
06:05:03.270 --> 06:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
take them or at the end so we send them
 
06:05:06.030 --> 06:05:06.040 align:start position:0%
out they're two sections of the test um
 
06:05:07.788 --> 06:05:07.798 align:start position:0%
as a complete one section they're sent
 
06:05:09.590 --> 06:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
out we correct that section if they
 
06:05:11.110 --> 06:05:11.120 align:start position:0%
don't pass that section we don't make
 
06:05:14.070 --> 06:05:14.080 align:start position:0%
them take the other section so they need
 
06:05:15.990 --> 06:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
to leave and then take whatever section
 
06:05:19.190 --> 06:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
they didn't pass again um and they're
 
06:05:21.350 --> 06:05:21.360 align:start position:0%
corrected right then unlike oral boards
 
06:05:23.230 --> 06:05:23.240 align:start position:0%
that for those of you that AR in in
 
06:05:25.948 --> 06:05:25.958 align:start position:0%
professions that that you are subject to
 
06:05:28.150 --> 06:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
oral boards
 
06:05:31.510 --> 06:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
um my oral boards and the fire service
 
06:05:33.270 --> 06:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
the I was sat on the other side of the
 
06:05:35.110 --> 06:05:35.120 align:start position:0%
table for firefighters and it was a
 
06:05:35.120 --> 06:05:37.070 align:start position:0%
table for firefighters and it was a
question

06:05:37.070 --> 06:05:37.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:05:38.510 --> 06:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
and it said at the bottom of it 30
 
06:05:41.708 --> 06:05:41.718 align:start position:0%
points period ours are actually divided
 
06:05:45.110 --> 06:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
up um so for
 
06:05:47.628 --> 06:05:47.638 align:start position:0%
instance I can give away one I can give
 
06:05:52.070 --> 06:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
away one question so if if you're
 
06:05:55.230 --> 06:05:55.240 align:start position:0%
scenario your your person fell down and
 
06:05:58.230 --> 06:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
is not breathing and is not beating and
 
06:06:00.230 --> 06:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
is not
 
06:06:03.590 --> 06:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
moving and you don't do CPR you will not
 
06:06:06.910 --> 06:06:06.920 align:start position:0%
be a guide period that's the end of the
 
06:06:10.548 --> 06:06:10.558 align:start position:0%
day so if that is a cause for somebody
 
06:06:13.030 --> 06:06:13.040 align:start position:0%
to be concerned
 
06:06:15.628 --> 06:06:15.638 align:start position:0%
then we're then I I have been wrong for
 
06:06:20.390 --> 06:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
a long time um but there are points so
 
06:06:22.270 --> 06:06:22.280 align:start position:0%
for instance if you don't put on if I
 
06:06:24.590 --> 06:06:24.600 align:start position:0%
didn't as an EMT put on my gloves I
 
06:06:27.590 --> 06:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
failed no matter how well I did CPR
 
06:06:29.548 --> 06:06:29.558 align:start position:0%
that's not necessarily the case here
 
06:06:30.670 --> 06:06:30.680 align:start position:0%
because we're in the woods we know
 
06:06:32.788 --> 06:06:32.798 align:start position:0%
people don't adhere to those same
 
06:06:36.590 --> 06:06:36.600 align:start position:0%
standards that we adhere to so
 
06:06:37.750 --> 06:06:37.760 align:start position:0%
although they should because we
 
06:06:39.830 --> 06:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
shouldn't share bodily fluids but that's
 
06:06:43.350 --> 06:06:43.360 align:start position:0%
another that's another thing um so those
 
06:06:46.628 --> 06:06:46.638 align:start position:0%
are those are issues that are graded and
 
06:06:49.708 --> 06:06:49.718 align:start position:0%
to say that they are not that they are
 
06:06:52.628 --> 06:06:52.638 align:start position:0%
individual that we give an test to an
 
06:06:54.750 --> 06:06:54.760 align:start position:0%
individual and a different test to the
 
06:06:56.830 --> 06:06:56.840 align:start position:0%
next individual is not
 
06:07:00.190 --> 06:07:00.200 align:start position:0%
correct I not a position to divulge the
 
06:07:02.788 --> 06:07:02.798 align:start position:0%
contents of the test but I can tell you
 
06:07:05.708 --> 06:07:05.718 align:start position:0%
that those tests are written they are
 
06:07:08.390 --> 06:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
formulated and they are used there are
 
06:07:11.510 --> 06:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
multiple tests so there may be different
 
06:07:13.910 --> 06:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
tests given that day but they are not
 
06:07:15.788 --> 06:07:15.798 align:start position:0%
ones Dave P didn't sit down and make up
 
06:07:19.750 --> 06:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
a test for candidate a and then with
 
06:07:21.670 --> 06:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
different answers and candidate B for
 
06:07:24.350 --> 06:07:24.360 align:start position:0%
different answers that does not
 
06:07:29.868 --> 06:07:29.878 align:start position:0%
happen followup followup so um and I
 
06:07:31.868 --> 06:07:31.878 align:start position:0%
understand you said you know
 
06:07:33.390 --> 06:07:33.400 align:start position:0%
electricians license there's going to be
 
06:07:35.590 --> 06:07:35.600 align:start position:0%
electricians on the board and
 
06:07:38.788 --> 06:07:38.798 align:start position:0%
firefighters and so forth so the
 
06:07:43.750 --> 06:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
amendment would um take that restriction
 
06:07:45.468 --> 06:07:45.478 align:start position:0%
away so they would be Fish and Game
 
06:07:47.430 --> 06:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
officers but they would not be Fish and
 
06:07:50.310 --> 06:07:50.320 align:start position:0%
Game officers that are also guides um do
 
06:07:52.468 --> 06:07:52.478 align:start position:0%
you feel in your experience that fish
 
06:07:53.670 --> 06:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
and game
 
06:07:56.030 --> 06:07:56.040 align:start position:0%
officers since they're not licensed as
 
06:08:00.070 --> 06:08:00.080 align:start position:0%
guides are the one are CA capable of
 
06:08:03.150 --> 06:08:03.160 align:start position:0%
judging the the oral part of the the
 
06:08:05.990 --> 06:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
test are they do they have
 
06:08:07.990 --> 06:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
you know the the knowledge that they
 
06:08:11.270 --> 06:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
would need in order to make a um
 
06:08:11.280 --> 06:08:13.590 align:start position:0%
would need in order to make a um
intelligent

06:08:13.590 --> 06:08:13.600 align:start position:0%
intelligent
 
06:08:16.270 --> 06:08:16.280 align:start position:0%
decision I think they
 
06:08:16.280 --> 06:08:21.628 align:start position:0%
decision I think they
do

06:08:21.628 --> 06:08:21.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:24.230 --> 06:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
um I would say
 
06:08:26.788 --> 06:08:26.798 align:start position:0%
that as a guide I come to it a little
 
06:08:28.868 --> 06:08:28.878 align:start position:0%
bit differently than than an officer
 
06:08:32.708 --> 06:08:32.718 align:start position:0%
might and I come to it as a uh as a
 
06:08:35.270 --> 06:08:35.280 align:start position:0%
service um if you'll indulge me for a
 
06:08:38.190 --> 06:08:38.200 align:start position:0%
moment I'll give you an example of a by
 
06:08:41.628 --> 06:08:41.638 align:start position:0%
all means so if you in one of the tests
 
06:08:43.590 --> 06:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
that we now don't use we won't use
 
06:08:45.948 --> 06:08:45.958 align:start position:0%
anymore uh the individual was asked to
 
06:08:49.750 --> 06:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
navigate over Frozen ice um in the dark
 
06:08:52.390 --> 06:08:52.400 align:start position:0%
we expect certain answers the fact that
 
06:08:55.510 --> 06:08:55.520 align:start position:0%
I'm going to take out my compass and sit
 
06:08:58.030 --> 06:08:58.040 align:start position:0%
on an ATV and drive and expect to get a
 
06:09:00.868 --> 06:09:00.878 align:start position:0%
correct answer will never ever pass the
 
06:09:03.110 --> 06:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
test for a whole bunch of
 
06:09:06.868 --> 06:09:06.878 align:start position:0%
reasons um however we
 
06:09:09.590 --> 06:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
expect the them to give us some which
 
06:09:11.990 --> 06:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
you learned in Hunter by the way none of
 
06:09:14.310 --> 06:09:14.320 align:start position:0%
this you learned this technique in
 
06:09:16.628 --> 06:09:16.638 align:start position:0%
Hunter education in that 45
 
06:09:19.430 --> 06:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
minutes um however we had one individual
 
06:09:21.590 --> 06:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
that came and said well I
 
06:09:24.150 --> 06:09:24.160 align:start position:0%
would take a bearing on the Stars I know
 
06:09:26.868 --> 06:09:26.878 align:start position:0%
where the North Star is I know where and
 
06:09:29.708 --> 06:09:29.718 align:start position:0%
went right through the process and the
 
06:09:31.548 --> 06:09:31.558 align:start position:0%
officer and I look at we looked each
 
06:09:35.750 --> 06:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
other went great answer we didn't think
 
06:09:38.868 --> 06:09:38.878 align:start position:0%
of that but we didn't tell them it was
 
06:09:41.830 --> 06:09:41.840 align:start position:0%
cloudy so great answer so that's an
 
06:09:45.590 --> 06:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
example of it's not a you don't do it
 
06:09:47.708 --> 06:09:47.718 align:start position:0%
I'm going to say Dave's way or the or
 
06:09:49.548 --> 06:09:49.558 align:start position:0%
the way Christian game wants that we
 
06:09:50.910 --> 06:09:50.920 align:start position:0%
don't accept the answer but the answer
 
06:09:54.430 --> 06:09:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:56.990 --> 06:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
outcome did that
 
06:09:59.948 --> 06:09:59.958 align:start position:0%
help yes thank
 
06:10:06.670 --> 06:10:06.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:09.390 --> 06:10:09.400 align:start position:0%
or that is
 
06:10:13.190 --> 06:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:16.590 --> 06:10:16.600 align:start position:0%
up using a different test on each person
 
06:10:18.948 --> 06:10:18.958 align:start position:0%
during the O exam I would imagine not
 
06:10:22.910 --> 06:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily sir um the it it's a
 
06:10:25.110 --> 06:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
different test if you're fishing or
 
06:10:30.230 --> 06:10:30.240 align:start position:0%
hunting um and other than that I would
 
06:10:32.030 --> 06:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
say unless an individual came in for a
 
06:10:35.350 --> 06:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
second time so fishing game notes that
 
06:10:36.830 --> 06:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
and they won't be given that same test
 
06:10:38.548 --> 06:10:38.558 align:start position:0%
again so we could use different tests
 
06:10:40.150 --> 06:10:40.160 align:start position:0%
but typically over the day if they're
 
06:10:44.030 --> 06:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
all brand new people we use the same
 
06:10:48.230 --> 06:10:48.240 align:start position:0%
followup follow up so
 
06:10:50.868 --> 06:10:50.878 align:start position:0%
um who decides whether the you said
 
06:10:53.468 --> 06:10:53.478 align:start position:0%
there's two or three who decides always
 
06:10:57.150 --> 06:10:57.160 align:start position:0%
two always two um does it take two to
 
06:11:00.510 --> 06:11:00.520 align:start position:0%
fail them or one to fail them or I'm
 
06:11:02.670 --> 06:11:02.680 align:start position:0%
sorry when he answers the question who
 
06:11:05.468 --> 06:11:05.478 align:start position:0%
decides you're both one says he's good
 
06:11:08.150 --> 06:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
one says he's
 
06:11:12.708 --> 06:11:12.718 align:start position:0%
bad uh the way it's done is the
 
06:11:17.070 --> 06:11:17.080 align:start position:0%
currently is the re
 
06:11:20.670 --> 06:11:20.680 align:start position:0%
so you get five points
 
06:11:23.548 --> 06:11:23.558 align:start position:0%
for doing this activity you get five
 
06:11:25.670 --> 06:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
points for doing this activity the total
 
06:11:29.350 --> 06:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
is 20 points so I might check off two of
 
06:11:33.750 --> 06:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
the four and the person I'm with cat
 
06:11:36.230 --> 06:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
checks off three of the four and when we
 
06:11:38.270 --> 06:11:38.280 align:start position:0%
send them out of the room go well I've
 
06:11:39.750 --> 06:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
only got I only heard two of those
 
06:11:42.750 --> 06:11:42.760 align:start position:0%
answers well I heard I heard this person
 
06:11:47.390 --> 06:11:47.400 align:start position:0%
say d d d so in the end our grading is
 
06:11:50.590 --> 06:11:50.600 align:start position:0%
very very close if not exactly the same
 
06:11:53.150 --> 06:11:53.160 align:start position:0%
so I think so it would take two of us to
 
06:11:55.430 --> 06:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
fail I guess it takes two to pass or
 
06:11:58.590 --> 06:11:58.600 align:start position:0%
fail you know but I I have never been
 
06:12:01.070 --> 06:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
and again I've been involved in this
 
06:12:03.708 --> 06:12:03.718 align:start position:0%
institution and I have not been in a
 
06:12:06.030 --> 06:12:06.040 align:start position:0%
circumstance where we
 
06:12:08.830 --> 06:12:08.840 align:start position:0%
had a situation that we
 
06:12:08.840 --> 06:12:11.430 align:start position:0%
had a situation that we
disagreed

06:12:11.430 --> 06:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
disagreed
 
06:12:11.440 --> 06:12:12.990 align:start position:0%

New Hampshire guides
 
06:12:41.830 --> 06:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:44.868 --> 06:12:44.878 align:start position:0%
gentlemen um so on behalf of the guides
 
06:12:49.310 --> 06:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
Association we are opposed to uh this
 
06:12:53.030 --> 06:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
bill um I'd like to say that um so I I
 
06:12:55.670 --> 06:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
was also a licensed guide in Alaska and
 
06:12:57.150 --> 06:12:57.160 align:start position:0%
I remember telling the guys out there
 
06:12:59.070 --> 06:12:59.080 align:start position:0%
you know New Hampshire is a small state
 
06:13:00.670 --> 06:13:00.680 align:start position:0%
when when you're in Alaska you're you
 
06:13:02.830 --> 06:13:02.840 align:start position:0%
know it's it's big and vast and people
 
06:13:05.390 --> 06:13:05.400 align:start position:0%
think this is the real deal well you
 
06:13:07.590 --> 06:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
come to New Hampshire and you get in the
 
06:13:09.270 --> 06:13:09.280 align:start position:0%
middle of our mountain range or whether
 
06:13:11.430 --> 06:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
you're in the middle of the Alaska range
 
06:13:13.868 --> 06:13:13.878 align:start position:0%
it's all relevant it's it's it's
 
06:13:16.788 --> 06:13:16.798 align:start position:0%
relevant you're in the wilderness and so
 
06:13:18.510 --> 06:13:18.520 align:start position:0%
training is
 
06:13:21.270 --> 06:13:21.280 align:start position:0%
essential now we have uh the New
 
06:13:23.230 --> 06:13:23.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Outdoor Learning Center that
 
06:13:26.788 --> 06:13:26.798 align:start position:0%
does a guide school program on many of
 
06:13:29.590 --> 06:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
the guys that take the test have have
 
06:13:31.910 --> 06:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
gone through that program they do pretty
 
06:13:34.510 --> 06:13:34.520 align:start position:0%
well does everybody pass a first time of
 
06:13:36.230 --> 06:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
course not
 
06:13:38.230 --> 06:13:38.240 align:start position:0%
most people do most people do come back
 
06:13:40.990 --> 06:13:41.000 align:start position:0%
and retest and and do
 
06:13:43.788 --> 06:13:43.798 align:start position:0%
pass is that you know the the gentleman
 
06:13:46.110 --> 06:13:46.120 align:start position:0%
sitting on the board on doing the oral
 
06:13:49.590 --> 06:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
exam i' I've never been there myself um
 
06:13:52.270 --> 06:13:52.280 align:start position:0%
but they are not there to fail anybody
 
06:13:54.430 --> 06:13:54.440 align:start position:0%
they just want the individuals to be the
 
06:13:57.350 --> 06:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
very best they can be they take great
 
06:13:59.510 --> 06:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
pride in in the test they take great
 
06:14:01.310 --> 06:14:01.320 align:start position:0%
pride in the state of New Hampshire they
 
06:14:03.670 --> 06:14:03.680 align:start position:0%
just want these guys to be guys and gals
 
06:14:06.070 --> 06:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
to be the best they can be so it's it's
 
06:14:10.030 --> 06:14:10.040 align:start position:0%
like like no other exam I mean study
 
06:14:12.590 --> 06:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
study guys you know and as far as the
 
06:14:15.270 --> 06:14:15.280 align:start position:0%
oral exam is concerned like Mr P just
 
06:14:17.910 --> 06:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
stated there's there's two or three
 
06:14:20.030 --> 06:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
people there they're they're working on
 
06:14:22.510 --> 06:14:22.520 align:start position:0%
a grading system they're comparing so
 
06:14:25.190 --> 06:14:25.200 align:start position:0%
it's it it's not set up to make somebody
 
06:14:28.628 --> 06:14:28.638 align:start position:0%
fail so I just like the board to
 
06:14:30.110 --> 06:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
understand that we really take great
 
06:14:32.548 --> 06:14:32.558 align:start position:0%
pride in this and we take great pride in
 
06:14:34.230 --> 06:14:34.240 align:start position:0%

the uh Fishing Game Commission and they
 
06:15:06.708 --> 06:15:06.718 align:start position:0%
are opposed uh to this bill for several
 
06:15:10.468 --> 06:15:10.478 align:start position:0%
reasons um one of which is that
 
06:15:15.350 --> 06:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
um the uh section B um of this uh of
 
06:15:17.948 --> 06:15:17.958 align:start position:0%
this bill speaks about a uh conservation
 
06:15:21.468 --> 06:15:21.478 align:start position:0%
officer uh who is a licensed guide um
 
06:15:23.310 --> 06:15:23.320 align:start position:0%
being part of this oral board or the
 
06:15:27.430 --> 06:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
only people on this oral board um so
 
06:15:29.430 --> 06:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
there is already there will always will
 
06:15:32.150 --> 06:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
be a conservation officer on this board
 
06:15:33.670 --> 06:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
um they're not a licensed guide we do
 
06:15:35.910 --> 06:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
not have any conser a officers at our
 
06:15:38.830 --> 06:15:38.840 align:start position:0%
license guide we had one um and he is in
 
06:15:42.548 --> 06:15:42.558 align:start position:0%
a sense retired um understand we don't
 
06:15:46.190 --> 06:15:46.200 align:start position:0%
encourage our officers to be guides um
 
06:15:47.990 --> 06:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
when they become conservation officers
 
06:15:49.750 --> 06:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
because really it is a conflict of
 
06:15:51.948 --> 06:15:51.958 align:start position:0%
interest um they you know to have a
 
06:15:53.750 --> 06:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
conservation officer driving around all
 
06:15:55.948 --> 06:15:55.958 align:start position:0%
week and you know it's moose Seasons
 
06:15:57.270 --> 06:15:57.280 align:start position:0%
coming up and they're going to guide for
 
06:15:59.708 --> 06:15:59.718 align:start position:0%
somebody and they see a bull um in an
 
06:16:01.868 --> 06:16:01.878 align:start position:0%
area that's a bit of a uh you know and
 
06:16:03.628 --> 06:16:03.638 align:start position:0%
then they take that person who's paying
 
06:16:05.868 --> 06:16:05.878 align:start position:0%
them that's a that's a conflict of
 
06:16:10.270 --> 06:16:10.280 align:start position:0%
interest um so uh you know really that's
 
06:16:13.270 --> 06:16:13.280 align:start position:0%
uh that's one section um and also after
 
06:16:16.548 --> 06:16:16.558 align:start position:0%
the fact um you know if we were to you
 
06:16:18.910 --> 06:16:18.920 align:start position:0%
know we we try to have the same officers
 
06:16:21.590 --> 06:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
on there but certainly days off conflict
 
06:16:24.150 --> 06:16:24.160 align:start position:0%
and and vacations and such so having
 
06:16:26.430 --> 06:16:26.440 align:start position:0%
other officers be able to go in and do
 
06:16:29.788 --> 06:16:29.798 align:start position:0%
that essentially that same uh role um
 
06:16:32.390 --> 06:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
but you know we uh at full contingent
 
06:16:35.430 --> 06:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
have 48 officers and we would have to to
 
06:16:39.430 --> 06:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
certify All 48 officers for being guides
 
06:16:41.910 --> 06:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
and um as representative olette pointed
 
06:16:43.628 --> 06:16:43.638 align:start position:0%
out this really that would be a
 
06:16:46.390 --> 06:16:46.400 align:start position:0%
financial burden um on the department as
 
06:16:46.400 --> 06:16:47.310 align:start position:0%
financial burden um on the department as
well

06:16:47.310 --> 06:16:47.320 align:start position:0%
well
 
06:16:49.948 --> 06:16:49.958 align:start position:0%
because when you ask you know an
 
06:16:52.590 --> 06:16:52.600 align:start position:0%
employee to do something in and above
 
06:16:54.868 --> 06:16:54.878 align:start position:0%
what they you know are are doing you
 
06:16:57.390 --> 06:16:57.400 align:start position:0%
have to pay for that and right now
 
06:16:59.070 --> 06:16:59.080 align:start position:0%
there's a lawsuit going on in the state
 
06:17:02.070 --> 06:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
for inband uh where if you hold a
 
06:17:03.590 --> 06:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
certification so if I hold a
 
06:17:05.310 --> 06:17:05.320 align:start position:0%
certification because I'm on the dive
 
06:17:07.590 --> 06:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
team I get to have I get to have a
 
06:17:10.468 --> 06:17:10.478 align:start position:0%
higher pay grade because I have hold
 
06:17:13.510 --> 06:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
that certification so now for you are
 
06:17:16.390 --> 06:17:16.400 align:start position:0%
also paying for them to be certified but
 
06:17:18.788 --> 06:17:18.798 align:start position:0%
also paying for that increase in their
 
06:17:21.430 --> 06:17:21.440 align:start position:0%
pay because you have now certified them
 
06:17:24.350 --> 06:17:24.360 align:start position:0%
so um and any anything else that we do
 
06:17:25.788 --> 06:17:25.798 align:start position:0%
uh you know though it's it's uh
 
06:17:28.150 --> 06:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
Wilderness first responder a dive
 
06:17:30.468 --> 06:17:30.478 align:start position:0%
training whatever the case may be the
 
06:17:33.270 --> 06:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
department takes on that that uh that
 
06:17:35.430 --> 06:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
cost so really
 
06:17:38.628 --> 06:17:38.638 align:start position:0%
that's a burden um on on the department
 
06:17:40.750 --> 06:17:40.760 align:start position:0%
um the other portion of the bill C I'll
 
06:17:43.468 --> 06:17:43.478 align:start position:0%
speak to is that um and from the
 
06:17:45.830 --> 06:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
previous years that the similar bill has
 
06:17:48.868 --> 06:17:48.878 align:start position:0%
been uh introduced um there was some uh
 
06:17:50.788 --> 06:17:50.798 align:start position:0%
actually this committee suggested that
 
06:17:53.788 --> 06:17:53.798 align:start position:0%
we give examples of what a test looks
 
06:17:56.910 --> 06:17:56.920 align:start position:0%
like and now um an older test is
 
06:17:59.708 --> 06:17:59.718 align:start position:0%
actually online um so that it can be
 
06:18:02.948 --> 06:18:02.958 align:start position:0%
reviewed and um you know anyone that's
 
06:18:05.788 --> 06:18:05.798 align:start position:0%
applying can actually go on there and
 
06:18:08.270 --> 06:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
have have kind of an idea of what that
 
06:18:11.750 --> 06:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
looks like now asking us to to take you
 
06:18:14.110 --> 06:18:14.120 align:start position:0%
know tests that we're currently giving
 
06:18:16.430 --> 06:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
and putting on there with the answers I
 
06:18:18.030 --> 06:18:18.040 align:start position:0%
I think that's unreasonable as is
 
06:18:19.708 --> 06:18:19.718 align:start position:0%
previously testified there are guide
 
06:18:21.070 --> 06:18:21.080 align:start position:0%
schools there's one in this state
 
06:18:24.548 --> 06:18:24.558 align:start position:0%
there's one in Maine um and you know
 
06:18:26.590 --> 06:18:26.600 align:start position:0%
that is certainly another Avenue as well
 
06:18:29.788 --> 06:18:29.798 align:start position:0%
as the other you know avenues for or the
 
06:18:32.310 --> 06:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
suggestions that we give for um being
 
06:18:35.430 --> 06:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
able to to review before they take that
 
06:18:38.150 --> 06:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
test so really this would be a burden um
 
06:18:40.590 --> 06:18:40.600 align:start position:0%
you know we have folks that come in and
 
06:18:43.270 --> 06:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
pass this test all the time um certainly
 
06:18:44.750 --> 06:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
there are folks that come in and don't
 
06:18:47.310 --> 06:18:47.320 align:start position:0%
pass and some of them don't pass every
 
06:18:50.510 --> 06:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
time that they kind of uh come in and
 
06:18:54.468 --> 06:18:54.478 align:start position:0%
and take the test so um but um you know
 
06:18:56.788 --> 06:18:56.798 align:start position:0%
and and and as far as if the question is
 
06:18:59.548 --> 06:18:59.558 align:start position:0%
what you know what's the percentage um
 
06:19:01.030 --> 06:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes we have people that come in we
 
06:19:03.788 --> 06:19:03.798 align:start position:0%
have five people maybe one of those pass
 
06:19:05.708 --> 06:19:05.718 align:start position:0%
maybe the next time around all five of
 
06:19:08.708 --> 06:19:08.718 align:start position:0%
them pass it's really uh hit or miss but
 
06:19:11.990 --> 06:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
certainly it's a passable test and uh we
 
06:19:18.070 --> 06:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
do make every um every reasonable um um
 
06:19:19.868 --> 06:19:19.878 align:start position:0%
effort to make to make sure that they do
 
06:19:19.878 --> 06:19:22.628 align:start position:0%
effort to make to make sure that they do
pass

06:19:22.628 --> 06:19:22.638 align:start position:0%
pass
 
06:19:25.070 --> 06:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
so representative
 
06:19:27.670 --> 06:19:27.680 align:start position:0%
Khan thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
06:19:30.430 --> 06:19:30.440 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh private
 
06:19:35.670 --> 06:19:35.680 align:start position:0%
sponsor U um stated that at the last um
 
06:19:39.510 --> 06:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
session the last term when we discussed
 
06:19:42.350 --> 06:19:42.360 align:start position:0%
this bill or similar Bill there was some
 
06:19:44.430 --> 06:19:44.440 align:start position:0%
issues and she took care of those issues
 
06:19:47.788 --> 06:19:47.798 align:start position:0%
you know in this bill what is the what
 
06:19:49.548 --> 06:19:49.558 align:start position:0%
what is the problem you know why we
 
06:19:51.910 --> 06:19:51.920 align:start position:0%
cannot go ahead with this point how how
 
06:19:57.070 --> 06:19:57.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:59.150 --> 06:19:59.160 align:start position:0%
bill that's a great question I I don't
 
06:20:01.070 --> 06:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
know what the right answer is um like I
 
06:20:03.390 --> 06:20:03.400 align:start position:0%
said the the process we already have is
 
06:20:06.150 --> 06:20:06.160 align:start position:0%
not unlike other states around us I know
 
06:20:08.788 --> 06:20:08.798 align:start position:0%
Maine has a similar process um where
 
06:20:11.150 --> 06:20:11.160 align:start position:0%
they have a written test and an oral
 
06:20:14.510 --> 06:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
board um so and I don't know what you
 
06:20:16.430 --> 06:20:16.440 align:start position:0%
know issues they have over there but
 
06:20:18.750 --> 06:20:18.760 align:start position:0%
really um like I said this is a it's a
 
06:20:20.788 --> 06:20:20.798 align:start position:0%
professional test we don't make it easy
 
06:20:24.030 --> 06:20:24.040 align:start position:0%
for a reason we don't want people to to
 
06:20:26.070 --> 06:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
take money and and take people out into
 
06:20:28.150 --> 06:20:28.160 align:start position:0%
the onto the waters and into the woods
 
06:20:30.670 --> 06:20:30.680 align:start position:0%
and then um you know I can think of one
 
06:20:33.270 --> 06:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
instance before we had a a really you
 
06:20:36.430 --> 06:20:36.440 align:start position:0%
know uh stringent test like this where a
 
06:20:39.750 --> 06:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
guy did take a 70 and an 80y old client
 
06:20:42.110 --> 06:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
out into the woods for a moose hunt and
 
06:20:44.110 --> 06:20:44.120 align:start position:0%
then said oh I have some personal issues
 
06:20:46.788 --> 06:20:46.798 align:start position:0%
and left them there um so you know we
 
06:20:49.270 --> 06:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
certainly can't have people uh doing
 
06:20:51.030 --> 06:20:51.040 align:start position:0%
that and that's why the stress that's
 
06:20:52.948 --> 06:20:52.958 align:start position:0%
why this test is as stringent and we
 
06:20:54.948 --> 06:20:54.958 align:start position:0%
have folks from The Guiding community
 
06:20:58.310 --> 06:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
that are part of it follow follow up
 
06:21:03.468 --> 06:21:03.478 align:start position:0%
follow up uh so um how many guys we give
 
06:21:05.070 --> 06:21:05.080 align:start position:0%
license a year
 
06:21:10.830 --> 06:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
or uh uh you know in a in a just say a
 
06:21:12.910 --> 06:21:12.920 align:start position:0%
year unfortunately I don't have that
 
06:21:14.430 --> 06:21:14.440 align:start position:0%
answer for you I can certainly get it
 
06:21:17.468 --> 06:21:17.478 align:start position:0%
and forward it to uh the committee one
 
06:21:17.478 --> 06:21:18.510 align:start position:0%
and forward it to uh the committee one
more

06:21:18.510 --> 06:21:18.520 align:start position:0%
more
 
06:21:20.590 --> 06:21:20.600 align:start position:0%
followup follow
 
06:21:24.830 --> 06:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
up thank you Mr chairman um I am this is
 
06:21:28.030 --> 06:21:28.040 align:start position:0%
just like a comment I'm not very happy
 
06:21:31.910 --> 06:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
that uh your two member who take the
 
06:21:34.270 --> 06:21:34.280 align:start position:0%
test you know should be three or five
 
06:21:36.390 --> 06:21:36.400 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's you know I didn't
 
06:21:38.590 --> 06:21:38.600 align:start position:0%
know that before just I want to express
 
06:21:38.600 --> 06:21:40.750 align:start position:0%
know that before just I want to express
my

06:21:40.750 --> 06:21:40.760 align:start position:0%
my
 
06:21:42.948 --> 06:21:42.958 align:start position:0%
um thank
 
06:21:45.030 --> 06:21:45.040 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
06:21:48.590 --> 06:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
Harvey um okay so I I'm getting more and
 
06:21:52.030 --> 06:21:52.040 align:start position:0%
more confused um usually when I read a
 
06:21:54.030 --> 06:21:54.040 align:start position:0%
bill I can see oh that's so different
 
06:21:56.390 --> 06:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
from you know what's happening but I'm
 
06:21:58.070 --> 06:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
having trouble seeing the difference
 
06:22:00.708 --> 06:22:00.718 align:start position:0%
with this so section A doesn't change
 
06:22:04.628 --> 06:22:04.638 align:start position:0%
except for the pronoun um section B simp
 
06:22:06.910 --> 06:22:06.920 align:start position:0%
L says that the test would be
 
06:22:09.590 --> 06:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
administered by a fishing game officer
 
06:22:13.030 --> 06:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
not a licensed guide
 
06:22:15.990 --> 06:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
correct the with with the amendment with
 
06:22:16.000 --> 06:22:20.990 align:start position:0%
correct the with with the amendment with
the

06:22:20.990 --> 06:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:23.070 --> 06:22:23.080 align:start position:0%
amendment I apologize I don't believe I
 
06:22:24.910 --> 06:22:24.920 align:start position:0%
have the amendment I believe I have the
 
06:22:29.390 --> 06:22:29.400 align:start position:0%
introduced uh Bill okay follow up follow
 
06:22:31.990 --> 06:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
up okay and and section c I'm trying to
 
06:22:33.910 --> 06:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
figure out why that's necessary because
 
06:22:35.230 --> 06:22:35.240 align:start position:0%
you already
 
06:22:38.830 --> 06:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
put tests online both the written test
 
06:22:41.788 --> 06:22:41.798 align:start position:0%
and the oral test
 
06:22:45.830 --> 06:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
um for people to look at as as possible
 
06:22:48.310 --> 06:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
examples I understand that that's going
 
06:22:50.510 --> 06:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
to change periodically you're not going
 
06:22:53.788 --> 06:22:53.798 align:start position:0%
to give that exact test to a person
 
06:22:55.590 --> 06:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
you're going to change it but you
 
06:22:59.150 --> 06:22:59.160 align:start position:0%
already do that so I'm I'm just trying
 
06:23:02.628 --> 06:23:02.638 align:start position:0%
to figure out why C is necessary I
 
06:23:05.350 --> 06:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
guess certainly I would say that c is
 
06:23:07.070 --> 06:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
not necessary we we are already
 
06:23:09.230 --> 06:23:09.240 align:start position:0%
providing that provide periodicals that
 
06:23:11.590 --> 06:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
they can review and we would you know
 
06:23:13.350 --> 06:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
certainly ask them that they are having
 
06:23:15.750 --> 06:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
issues with that um that they would you
 
06:23:17.708 --> 06:23:17.718 align:start position:0%
know follow up with the schools that are
 
06:23:20.468 --> 06:23:20.478 align:start position:0%
out there I will also say that uh there
 
06:23:22.910 --> 06:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
is a bill in the Senate right now um
 
06:23:26.430 --> 06:23:26.440 align:start position:0%
that is a uh it's an apprentice guides
 
06:23:29.868 --> 06:23:29.878 align:start position:0%
bill um which also you know and that's
 
06:23:31.230 --> 06:23:31.240 align:start position:0%
actually did not come from fish and game
 
06:23:33.468 --> 06:23:33.478 align:start position:0%
came from the guides Association uh
 
06:23:35.430 --> 06:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
which is actually which would help on
 
06:23:36.910 --> 06:23:36.920 align:start position:0%
the circumstance that somebody did have
 
06:23:39.150 --> 06:23:39.160 align:start position:0%
a issue with taking the test they could
 
06:23:41.788 --> 06:23:41.798 align:start position:0%
become an apprentice and you know a a
 
06:23:44.990 --> 06:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
mentor guide could help them um to you
 
06:23:47.430 --> 06:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
know pass that test and to become better
 
06:23:51.590 --> 06:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable to do so thank you
 
06:23:51.600 --> 06:23:53.270 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable to do so thank you
representative

06:23:53.270 --> 06:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:23:55.468 --> 06:23:55.478 align:start position:0%
DeVito thank you Captain for taking my
 
06:23:57.830 --> 06:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
question um regarding the 48 officers
 
06:23:59.708 --> 06:23:59.718 align:start position:0%
that you guys have out in the field is
 
06:24:01.830 --> 06:24:01.840 align:start position:0%
it correct that you are down six right
 
06:24:05.590 --> 06:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
now so you are currently um
 
06:24:06.708 --> 06:24:06.718 align:start position:0%
currently don't have enough field
 
06:24:08.910 --> 06:24:08.920 align:start position:0%
officers so to pull someone away it
 
06:24:11.468 --> 06:24:11.478 align:start position:0%
would be even more strenuous on you
 
06:24:14.510 --> 06:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
guys that is correct um currently we're
 
06:24:17.430 --> 06:24:17.440 align:start position:0%
about 133% down as far as vacancies so
 
06:24:22.190 --> 06:24:22.200 align:start position:0%
that is about five or six and 21% down
 
06:24:25.110 --> 06:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
uh when you in when you add the injuries
 
06:24:26.510 --> 06:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
that we have or folks that are out of
 
06:24:29.590 --> 06:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
the field due to injuries so um yes now
 
06:24:31.628 --> 06:24:31.638 align:start position:0%
certainly the amendment um speaks to
 
06:24:33.670 --> 06:24:33.680 align:start position:0%
only fishing game officers but once
 
06:24:33.680 --> 06:24:34.868 align:start position:0%
only fishing game officers but once
again

06:24:34.868 --> 06:24:34.878 align:start position:0%
again
 
06:24:36.430 --> 06:24:36.440 align:start position:0%
if you have five fishing game officers
 
06:24:38.750 --> 06:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
you're now taking them out of the fields
 
06:24:42.230 --> 06:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
um to administer this test
 
06:24:47.110 --> 06:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
so representative love it thank you Mr
 
06:24:51.868 --> 06:24:51.878 align:start position:0%
chair um how many guides are there today
 
06:24:56.788 --> 06:24:56.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:59.230 --> 06:24:59.240 align:start position:0%
state once again I'm not sure of that
 
06:25:01.670 --> 06:25:01.680 align:start position:0%
answer I I don't know the the total
 
06:25:03.468 --> 06:25:03.478 align:start position:0%
number of guides or how many licenses we
 
06:25:06.310 --> 06:25:06.320 align:start position:0%
sell for it um certainly I know of some
 
06:25:08.390 --> 06:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
guides that because you you don't have
 
06:25:11.468 --> 06:25:11.478 align:start position:0%
to be a guide um necessarily but if you
 
06:25:13.310 --> 06:25:13.320 align:start position:0%
if you purchase your license or if you
 
06:25:15.030 --> 06:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
don't purchase a license for up to five
 
06:25:17.230 --> 06:25:17.240 align:start position:0%
years you can then purchase another one
 
06:25:18.510 --> 06:25:18.520 align:start position:0%
so that you don't have to continue to
 
06:25:20.310 --> 06:25:20.320 align:start position:0%
take the test so there are some folks
 
06:25:22.350 --> 06:25:22.360 align:start position:0%
out there that are just retaining their
 
06:25:24.468 --> 06:25:24.478 align:start position:0%
license but not actual guides I don't
 
06:25:27.990 --> 06:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
have the exact number I apologize
 
06:25:30.830 --> 06:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
do this is from your
 
06:25:38.270 --> 06:25:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:39.948 --> 06:25:39.958 align:start position:0%
100% sure this is accurate but I could
 
06:25:42.030 --> 06:25:42.040 align:start position:0%
certainly confirm when I get back but 15
 
06:25:51.670 --> 06:25:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:54.948 --> 06:25:54.958 align:start position:0%
fishing any other
 
06:25:57.390 --> 06:25:57.400 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
06:25:59.670 --> 06:25:59.680 align:start position:0%
time today thank
 
06:26:15.910 --> 06:26:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:20.390 --> 06:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:24.350 --> 06:26:24.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:26.948 --> 06:26:26.958 align:start position:0%
you about that
 
06:26:31.948 --> 06:26:31.958 align:start position:0%
okay um yeah so uh I guess I wanted to
 
06:26:33.750 --> 06:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
start out with just saying maybe a
 
06:26:35.070 --> 06:26:35.080 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
06:26:37.310 --> 06:26:37.320 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if you guys had the
 
06:26:39.830 --> 06:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
information that um we have to get
 
06:26:42.590 --> 06:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
certified for first aid I didn't know if
 
06:26:44.230 --> 06:26:44.240 align:start position:0%
you were aware of that so we have to go
 
06:26:47.510 --> 06:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
to classes for surf uh first aid in
 
06:26:52.230 --> 06:26:52.240 align:start position:0%
CPR we have to get a uh commercial boers
 
06:26:54.708 --> 06:26:54.718 align:start position:0%
licensed from Marine Patrol to be able
 
06:26:57.350 --> 06:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
to operate the boat um you know be
 
06:27:00.270 --> 06:27:00.280 align:start position:0%
licensed through for commercial to be
 
06:27:01.788 --> 06:27:01.798 align:start position:0%
able to take people out
 
06:27:06.150 --> 06:27:06.160 align:start position:0%
fishing and um I just wanted to say that
 
06:27:09.510 --> 06:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
I am I am for this
 
06:27:14.110 --> 06:27:14.120 align:start position:0%
bill I think that it's just what am I
 
06:27:16.548 --> 06:27:16.558 align:start position:0%
trying to say here I want to stay stay
 
06:27:16.558 --> 06:27:19.390 align:start position:0%
trying to say here I want to stay stay
short

06:27:19.390 --> 06:27:19.400 align:start position:0%
short
 
06:27:21.788 --> 06:27:21.798 align:start position:0%
um I'm losing my train of thought I'm
 
06:27:26.150 --> 06:27:26.160 align:start position:0%
not a good speaker um yeah so we're not
 
06:27:28.590 --> 06:27:28.600 align:start position:0%
looking for it to be any
 
06:27:32.190 --> 06:27:32.200 align:start position:0%
easier I think that's the that's the uh
 
06:27:34.788 --> 06:27:34.798 align:start position:0%
I keep hearing that about making tests
 
06:27:36.628 --> 06:27:36.638 align:start position:0%
easier or anything I I don't think we
 
06:27:39.910 --> 06:27:39.920 align:start position:0%
need to make them any easier um
 
06:27:42.310 --> 06:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts tells me come on down be a
 
06:27:45.230 --> 06:27:45.240 align:start position:0%
guide I don't agree with that I think
 
06:27:50.310 --> 06:27:50.320 align:start position:0%
you really should have a licensing thing
 
06:27:54.948 --> 06:27:54.958 align:start position:0%
um so I guess I'll just leave uh you
 
06:27:59.190 --> 06:27:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:02.390 --> 06:28:02.400 align:start position:0%
um your uh the new director comes from
 
06:28:05.350 --> 06:28:05.360 align:start position:0%
Washington State they have a nice setup
 
06:28:07.030 --> 06:28:07.040 align:start position:0%
there if you want to go on their website
 
06:28:08.948 --> 06:28:08.958 align:start position:0%
and see how they do guidelin
 
06:28:11.310 --> 06:28:11.320 align:start position:0%
anding they go through and have to have
 
06:28:13.750 --> 06:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
you uh all those certifications that I
 
06:28:16.150 --> 06:28:16.160 align:start position:0%
just talked about and you have to have
 
06:28:19.110 --> 06:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
insurance and um there is no testing but
 
06:28:20.310 --> 06:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
you have to have insurance and
 
06:28:20.320 --> 06:28:21.190 align:start position:0%
you have to have insurance and
everything

06:28:21.190 --> 06:28:21.200 align:start position:0%
everything
 
06:28:23.750 --> 06:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
else as far as the testing again I just
 
06:28:25.150 --> 06:28:25.160 align:start position:0%
want to repeat that we're not looking
 
06:28:27.510 --> 06:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
for it to get any easier I just feel
 
06:28:29.548 --> 06:28:29.558 align:start position:0%
like the fishing game offices are the
 
06:28:30.590 --> 06:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
best of the
 
06:28:33.350 --> 06:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
best they're the best in Search and
 
06:28:33.360 --> 06:28:34.788 align:start position:0%
best they're the best in Search and
Rescue

06:28:34.788 --> 06:28:34.798 align:start position:0%
Rescue
 
06:28:38.868 --> 06:28:38.878 align:start position:0%
their best in all rules and laws to do
 
06:28:41.868 --> 06:28:41.878 align:start position:0%
with fishing game and to do with
 
06:28:44.788 --> 06:28:44.798 align:start position:0%
anything of you know being a Woodsman or
 
06:28:46.468 --> 06:28:46.478 align:start position:0%
whatever they're the best of the best so
 
06:28:50.628 --> 06:28:50.638 align:start position:0%
I I don't see why it has to be go to an
 
06:28:55.670 --> 06:28:55.680 align:start position:0%
outside agency a outside entity the god
 
06:28:58.350 --> 06:28:58.360 align:start position:0%
Association to do the oral testing
 
06:29:00.990 --> 06:29:01.000 align:start position:0%
they're already taking
 
06:29:04.788 --> 06:29:04.798 align:start position:0%
offices off for the day to do the paper
 
06:29:07.830 --> 06:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
test I don't see it a big jump to take
 
06:29:10.948 --> 06:29:10.958 align:start position:0%
them off for a day once a not even once
 
06:29:13.350 --> 06:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
a month it's only uh what is it twice a
 
06:29:16.350 --> 06:29:16.360 align:start position:0%
year I think the testing is twice a year
 
06:29:18.948 --> 06:29:18.958 align:start position:0%
it's nothing to take them off for H five
 
06:29:21.910 --> 06:29:21.920 align:start position:0%
hours to do not even 5 hours who knows
 
06:29:24.070 --> 06:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
for the oral exam it's you're not you're
 
06:29:25.788 --> 06:29:25.798 align:start position:0%
not putting a burden on those officers
 
06:29:29.190 --> 06:29:29.200 align:start position:0%
at all I don't see it at at twice a year
 
06:29:29.200 --> 06:29:30.110 align:start position:0%
at all I don't see it at at twice a year
and

06:29:30.110 --> 06:29:30.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:29:32.510 --> 06:29:32.520 align:start position:0%
um that's about it that's all I want to
 
06:29:35.468 --> 06:29:35.478 align:start position:0%
say thanks for your time thank
 
06:29:38.990 --> 06:29:39.000 align:start position:0%

testing and all of that we expect this
 
06:30:16.670 --> 06:30:16.680 align:start position:0%
from you know if you're if you're you
 
06:30:18.430 --> 06:30:18.440 align:start position:0%
know I'm a college graduate if you go to
 
06:30:20.788 --> 06:30:20.798 align:start position:0%
college if you're in high school middle
 
06:30:23.150 --> 06:30:23.160 align:start position:0%
school you don't give
 
06:30:25.190 --> 06:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
someone basically say okay we're going
 
06:30:28.708 --> 06:30:28.718 align:start position:0%
to have a test on Friday um make sure
 
06:30:31.070 --> 06:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
you learn the materials but we're not
 
06:30:33.350 --> 06:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
going to provide you um with any of
 
06:30:35.510 --> 06:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
those materials that tell you where you
 
06:30:38.070 --> 06:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
can find the answers it's it's pure
 
06:30:42.110 --> 06:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
insanity and that's what it is right now
 
06:30:44.310 --> 06:30:44.320 align:start position:0%
giving giving someone that's going to be
 
06:30:46.670 --> 06:30:46.680 align:start position:0%
taking a test to and they want to become
 
06:30:49.190 --> 06:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
a guide or whatever or making it harder
 
06:30:52.030 --> 06:30:52.040 align:start position:0%
for them you can't just give a a list of
 
06:30:54.150 --> 06:30:54.160 align:start position:0%
you know 20 books or periodicals and say
 
06:30:56.270 --> 06:30:56.280 align:start position:0%
okay read through all these and here you
 
06:31:00.110 --> 06:31:00.120 align:start position:0%
go there should be a study guide I'm not
 
06:31:02.110 --> 06:31:02.120 align:start position:0%
giving the answers because we don't do
 
06:31:04.708 --> 06:31:04.718 align:start position:0%
that but on every single test that
 
06:31:06.270 --> 06:31:06.280 align:start position:0%
people are taking from standardized
 
06:31:08.868 --> 06:31:08.878 align:start position:0%
tests to the bar association to the SATs
 
06:31:11.948 --> 06:31:11.958 align:start position:0%
to the PSATs there's all there's all
 
06:31:14.910 --> 06:31:14.920 align:start position:0%
samples of what the questions could be
 
06:31:16.628 --> 06:31:16.638 align:start position:0%
and you basically are giving you
 
06:31:18.590 --> 06:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
materials where you can find answers to
 
06:31:20.910 --> 06:31:20.920 align:start position:0%
those questions so I think we are
 
06:31:24.070 --> 06:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
setting the bar ridiculously high for
 
06:31:28.548 --> 06:31:28.558 align:start position:0%
one thing um and I just and I think the
 
06:31:31.510 --> 06:31:31.520 align:start position:0%
outside entity piece is important as
 
06:31:34.750 --> 06:31:34.760 align:start position:0%
well that we remove that and keep within
 
06:31:37.788 --> 06:31:37.798 align:start position:0%
fish and game um you know there's some
 
06:31:40.150 --> 06:31:40.160 align:start position:0%
people here that I see that I recognize
 
06:31:44.230 --> 06:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
that have you know tried um feverishly
 
06:31:48.548 --> 06:31:48.558 align:start position:0%
to get a license and they've come up
 
06:31:50.110 --> 06:31:50.120 align:start position:0%
with this and that's you know and they
 
06:31:51.990 --> 06:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
came to of course their representatives
 
06:31:54.830 --> 06:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
to help fix this problem it shouldn't be
 
06:31:57.868 --> 06:31:57.878 align:start position:0%
must to ask we want everyone involved in
 
06:32:01.990 --> 06:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
working with um our environment um it's
 
06:32:03.948 --> 06:32:03.958 align:start position:0%
a good of course Revenue generator for
 
06:32:06.430 --> 06:32:06.440 align:start position:0%
our state uh travel and tourism all of
 
06:32:08.388 --> 06:32:08.398 align:start position:0%
that um so we're not we're not going to
 
06:32:10.670 --> 06:32:10.680 align:start position:0%
put unqualified people out but I did
 
06:32:14.150 --> 06:32:14.160 align:start position:0%
look last year at other at other states
 
06:32:15.270 --> 06:32:15.280 align:start position:0%
and we
 
06:32:19.030 --> 06:32:19.040 align:start position:0%
are really Beyond ridiculously stringent
 
06:32:21.548 --> 06:32:21.558 align:start position:0%
in this and and a control factor and I'm
 
06:32:24.670 --> 06:32:24.680 align:start position:0%
hoping that um you all see the amendment
 
06:32:27.548 --> 06:32:27.558 align:start position:0%
which is good and that we can make these
 
06:32:32.190 --> 06:32:32.200 align:start position:0%
changes which are very minimal um to
 
06:32:36.788 --> 06:32:36.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:39.750 --> 06:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
thank you any
 
06:32:42.948 --> 06:32:42.958 align:start position:0%
questions representative Harvey um thank
 
06:32:44.350 --> 06:32:44.360 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I'm trying to figure out
 
06:32:50.868 --> 06:32:50.878 align:start position:0%
how to word this as a question um so
 
06:32:55.670 --> 06:32:55.680 align:start position:0%
um I I hear you say that
 
06:32:58.948 --> 06:32:58.958 align:start position:0%
um we're not providing the
 
06:33:03.788 --> 06:33:03.798 align:start position:0%
materials that um are needed in order
 
06:33:05.788 --> 06:33:05.798 align:start position:0%
for candidates to learn what they need
 
06:33:09.110 --> 06:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
to learn to be on the test and that's
 
06:33:11.150 --> 06:33:11.160 align:start position:0%
not what's done in schools I sort of
 
06:33:16.070 --> 06:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
remember a curriculum um review but
 
06:33:19.070 --> 06:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
someone you even said that they're given
 
06:33:21.750 --> 06:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
you know a up to 20 books that there's a
 
06:33:24.468 --> 06:33:24.478 align:start position:0%
guide school and so forth so I feel are
 
06:33:27.190 --> 06:33:27.200 align:start position:0%
you contradicting yourself a little bit
 
06:33:29.110 --> 06:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
I'm it's not a nice way for me to ask
 
06:33:30.590 --> 06:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
that question no I'm not contradicting
 
06:33:33.990 --> 06:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
myself maybe I wasn't clear so if you if
 
06:33:36.510 --> 06:33:36.520 align:start position:0%
you're giving like books that aren't
 
06:33:38.430 --> 06:33:38.440 align:start position:0%
specifically what the test is like
 
06:33:40.830 --> 06:33:40.840 align:start position:0%
random books that you should learn or
 
06:33:43.750 --> 06:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
read just to learn about it that could
 
06:33:46.430 --> 06:33:46.440 align:start position:0%
have multitudes of different subjects
 
06:33:48.468 --> 06:33:48.478 align:start position:0%
which you have no idea where the test is
 
06:33:50.468 --> 06:33:50.478 align:start position:0%
going to be focused on you've got to
 
06:33:53.830 --> 06:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
give someone um without giving them the
 
06:33:56.350 --> 06:33:56.360 align:start position:0%
answers hey this is what you're going to
 
06:33:57.468 --> 06:33:57.478 align:start position:0%
this is what we're going to be focused
 
06:33:59.708 --> 06:33:59.718 align:start position:0%
on learn these subject areas you can't
 
06:34:01.430 --> 06:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
find any of that you also can't even
 
06:34:03.708 --> 06:34:03.718 align:start position:0%
find a phone number um about this to get
 
06:34:05.430 --> 06:34:05.440 align:start position:0%
get more information on the fishing game
 
06:34:11.990 --> 06:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:14.990 --> 06:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
scarce any other questions
 
06:34:19.750 --> 06:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:22.948 --> 06:34:22.958 align:start position:0%
you when you take a test to get your
 
06:34:26.310 --> 06:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
boers driver's license you go online and
 
06:34:28.270 --> 06:34:28.280 align:start position:0%
you can't go to chapter 2 until you
 
06:34:30.388 --> 06:34:30.398 align:start position:0%
finish you know you complete chapter one
 
06:34:33.270 --> 06:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
you just keep testing on until you
 
06:34:33.280 --> 06:34:34.670 align:start position:0%
you just keep testing on until you
finish

06:34:34.670 --> 06:34:34.680 align:start position:0%
finish
 
06:34:37.270 --> 06:34:37.280 align:start position:0%
and then you're able to take the
 
06:34:39.670 --> 06:34:39.680 align:start position:0%
test it's one of the things that I think
 
06:34:41.830 --> 06:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
about when we're sort of talking about
 
06:34:43.310 --> 06:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
the number of books and who's
 
06:34:46.310 --> 06:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
administering the test and and I just I
 
06:34:48.468 --> 06:34:48.478 align:start position:0%
mean I know that's probably a certainly
 
06:34:51.948 --> 06:34:51.958 align:start position:0%
an FN component to this question but I'm
 
06:34:55.590 --> 06:34:55.600 align:start position:0%
just I guess the question is would that
 
06:34:58.990 --> 06:34:59.000 align:start position:0%
be a standard that you would like to
 
06:35:01.830 --> 06:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
see to a test to take your guide's
 
06:35:04.590 --> 06:35:04.600 align:start position:0%
license where you have to just
 
06:35:07.830 --> 06:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
is it does that exist in another state I
 
06:35:09.708 --> 06:35:09.718 align:start position:0%
know that there's practice tests that
 
06:35:13.190 --> 06:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
exist in other states um so you know
 
06:35:16.750 --> 06:35:16.760 align:start position:0%
what the the content is going to be
 
06:35:19.750 --> 06:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
which not giving you the answers but the
 
06:35:21.788 --> 06:35:21.798 align:start position:0%
practice test is great I mean I've done
 
06:35:24.430 --> 06:35:24.440 align:start position:0%
tons of those um you know so you can
 
06:35:26.388 --> 06:35:26.398 align:start position:0%
know where you're at the beautiful part
 
06:35:28.510 --> 06:35:28.520 align:start position:0%
about like a practice test if if you're
 
06:35:31.468 --> 06:35:31.478 align:start position:0%
failing it um or a study guide which has
 
06:35:34.070 --> 06:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
a practice test attached to it is let's
 
06:35:36.270 --> 06:35:36.280 align:start position:0%
say you fail it it then tells you you
 
06:35:39.230 --> 06:35:39.240 align:start position:0%
need to go back to this this periodical
 
06:35:41.110 --> 06:35:41.120 align:start position:0%
and this periodical and this periodical
 
06:35:43.670 --> 06:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
this book or this chapter in review
 
06:35:46.070 --> 06:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
because that's where the answers are so
 
06:35:48.830 --> 06:35:48.840 align:start position:0%
we're not doing any of
 
06:35:52.070 --> 06:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
that so yes I think and I don't think it
 
06:35:54.110 --> 06:35:54.120 align:start position:0%
would cost a lot of money to do this I
 
06:35:56.510 --> 06:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
think it's they are I think it's just a
 
06:35:58.990 --> 06:35:59.000 align:start position:0%
little bit about being better organized
 
06:36:01.350 --> 06:36:01.360 align:start position:0%
and having more information out there
 
06:36:03.948 --> 06:36:03.958 align:start position:0%
for the public there not really much
 
06:36:07.948 --> 06:36:07.958 align:start position:0%
information or where to go for this
 
06:36:11.030 --> 06:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
twice a year it's very controlled um
 
06:36:12.548 --> 06:36:12.558 align:start position:0%
this bill's not asking for that to be
 
06:36:14.548 --> 06:36:14.558 align:start position:0%
opened up it's not asking for there to
 
06:36:17.070 --> 06:36:17.080 align:start position:0%
be more time more testing or any of that
 
06:36:19.910 --> 06:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
that would put a burden on fishing game
 
06:36:22.190 --> 06:36:22.200 align:start position:0%
this shouldn't put a burden on it let's
 
06:36:24.510 --> 06:36:24.520 align:start position:0%
keep the expertise inside let's keep it
 
06:36:27.548 --> 06:36:27.558 align:start position:0%
with the fishing game officers um let's
 
06:36:29.750 --> 06:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
button it up let's make it easier in the
 
06:36:31.388 --> 06:36:31.398 align:start position:0%
sense for people to be able to study and
 
06:36:32.948 --> 06:36:32.958 align:start position:0%
know what they're going to be tested on
 
06:36:37.190 --> 06:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
and to Hope that they can um and get and
 
06:36:39.190 --> 06:36:39.200 align:start position:0%
get where they want to want to be for
 
06:36:41.030 --> 06:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
whether it's fishing or hunting or
 
06:36:45.110 --> 06:36:45.120 align:start position:0%
whatever it may be thank you any other
 
06:36:47.990 --> 06:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
questions there is a
 
06:36:51.190 --> 06:36:51.200 align:start position:0%
pH seeing none thank you for your
 
06:36:54.190 --> 06:36:54.200 align:start position:0%
time is there anyone who wants to speak
 
06:37:10.750 --> 06:37:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:15.110 --> 06:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
hello I'm Glenn Burnham and um my
 
06:37:18.628 --> 06:37:18.638 align:start position:0%
concern about the oral exam is the um
 
06:37:20.230 --> 06:37:20.240 align:start position:0%
fact is that they don't give you the
 
06:37:22.948 --> 06:37:22.958 align:start position:0%
answers to these questions so they go
 
06:37:25.350 --> 06:37:25.360 align:start position:0%
through this scenario with you and then
 
06:37:28.590 --> 06:37:28.600 align:start position:0%
they tell you you you passed fail well
 
06:37:29.628 --> 06:37:29.638 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it
 
06:37:32.590 --> 06:37:32.600 align:start position:0%
be good for the people taking it to at
 
06:37:34.190 --> 06:37:34.200 align:start position:0%
least give them a ver
 
06:37:37.110 --> 06:37:37.120 align:start position:0%
explanation of what happened what didn't
 
06:37:38.590 --> 06:37:38.600 align:start position:0%
you know what was wrong with that
 
06:37:40.830 --> 06:37:40.840 align:start position:0%
scenario what was wrong with that answer
 
06:37:43.430 --> 06:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
they not the right it down but I also
 
06:37:45.590 --> 06:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
think that being a
 
06:37:48.150 --> 06:37:48.160 align:start position:0%
guide it would only be in their best
 
06:37:51.030 --> 06:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
benefit knowing the answers that their
 
06:37:53.868 --> 06:37:53.878 align:start position:0%
spouses their friends anybody around
 
06:37:56.468 --> 06:37:56.478 align:start position:0%
them would be familiar with the
 
06:37:58.708 --> 06:37:58.718 align:start position:0%
answers whereas the person that doesn't
 
06:38:03.190 --> 06:38:03.200 align:start position:0%
have a friend as a guide is you know out
 
06:38:05.468 --> 06:38:05.478 align:start position:0%
out the do he doesn't know where to ask
 
06:38:06.830 --> 06:38:06.840 align:start position:0%
these questions if you're not giving him
 
06:38:09.270 --> 06:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
an answer to your question how can you
 
06:38:13.030 --> 06:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
solve it go back to the 20 books again I
 
06:38:16.110 --> 06:38:16.120 align:start position:0%
think a little more clarity um and then
 
06:38:17.430 --> 06:38:17.440 align:start position:0%
that way there we don't feel like
 
06:38:19.270 --> 06:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
there's a conflict of interest with a
 
06:38:24.110 --> 06:38:24.120 align:start position:0%
guide versus offish game officer that's
 
06:38:27.468 --> 06:38:27.478 align:start position:0%
all thank you anybody have any
 
06:38:29.590 --> 06:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you so much
 
06:38:31.830 --> 06:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
for your time today thank you
 
06:38:34.708 --> 06:38:34.718 align:start position:0%
sir seeing no more cards is there
 
06:38:36.270 --> 06:38:36.280 align:start position:0%
anybody else in the audience who has yet
 
06:38:37.670 --> 06:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
to speak and would like
 
06:38:40.910 --> 06:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
to seeing none I now close the hearing
 
06:38:52.510 --> 06:38:52.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:54.830 --> 06:38:54.840 align:start position:0%
579 members of the committee the only
 
06:38:57.670 --> 06:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
Bill that we could possibly EXA today
 
06:38:59.510 --> 06:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
because of the need to wait for the
 
06:39:02.590 --> 06:39:02.600 align:start position:0%
amendment hearing is 579 does anybody
 
06:39:04.468 --> 06:39:04.478 align:start position:0%
feel prepared to exact that today or do
 
06:39:07.590 --> 06:39:07.600 align:start position:0%
you want to wait I would prefer to
 
06:39:10.150 --> 06:39:10.160 align:start position:0%
wait having one member decide that they
 
06:39:14.190 --> 06:39:14.200 align:start position:0%
would prefer to wait I I would like to
 
06:39:16.628 --> 06:39:16.638 align:start position:0%
vote you'd like to vote today I would
 
06:39:16.638 --> 06:39:17.708 align:start position:0%
vote you'd like to vote today I would
yes

06:39:17.708 --> 06:39:17.718 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:39:20.310 --> 06:39:20.320 align:start position:0%
okay all right so we've got two that
 
06:39:22.070 --> 06:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
would like to go ahead and exec and one
 
06:39:24.150 --> 06:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
that wanted to wait I'd like to get a
 
06:39:25.548 --> 06:39:25.558 align:start position:0%
consensus of the committee so we can
 
06:39:29.350 --> 06:39:29.360 align:start position:0%
actually get a uh uh decent handle on
 
06:39:31.430 --> 06:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
whether we should or not so I'll do by a
 
06:39:34.430 --> 06:39:34.440 align:start position:0%
raise of hands point of order just if
 
06:39:36.230 --> 06:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
we're going to exec this bill can we
 
06:39:38.150 --> 06:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
have discussion about it we will during
 
06:39:40.430 --> 06:39:40.440 align:start position:0%
the exec first um rather than just
 
06:39:42.590 --> 06:39:42.600 align:start position:0%
calling for the vote yeah it would be a
 
06:39:45.190 --> 06:39:45.200 align:start position:0%
discussion during exact session
 
06:39:49.350 --> 06:39:49.360 align:start position:0%
okay um so um how many of you would like
 
06:39:53.230 --> 06:39:53.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:57.110 --> 06:39:57.120 align:start position:0%
today and how many would like to
 
06:40:01.868 --> 06:40:01.878 align:start position:0%
wait looks like uh exec today wins so I
 
06:40:09.350 --> 06:40:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:12.708 --> 06:40:12.718 align:start position:0%
579 and I will take a motion from
 
06:40:12.718 --> 06:40:16.990 align:start position:0%
579 and I will take a motion from
representative

06:40:16.990 --> 06:40:17.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:19.468 --> 06:40:19.478 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you Mr chair I make a motion
 
06:40:24.190 --> 06:40:24.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:27.788 --> 06:40:27.798 align:start position:0%
579 and I have a second from Sarah I
 
06:40:34.190 --> 06:40:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:35.708 --> 06:40:35.718 align:start position:0%
all right it's open for
 
06:40:37.990 --> 06:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Harvey would
 
06:40:40.750 --> 06:40:40.760 align:start position:0%
you like to lead off our
 
06:40:40.760 --> 06:40:42.270 align:start position:0%
you like to lead off our
discussion

06:40:42.270 --> 06:40:42.280 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
06:40:45.430 --> 06:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
um well no because my thoughts aren't
 
06:40:47.350 --> 06:40:47.360 align:start position:0%
organized go to somebody else and I'll I
 
06:40:49.270 --> 06:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
will raise my hand though so anybody
 
06:40:50.548 --> 06:40:50.558 align:start position:0%
else have an opinion on the bill they'd
 
06:40:52.310 --> 06:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
like to to put forward to everybody
 
06:40:55.310 --> 06:40:55.320 align:start position:0%
representative tutor yeah I'm just I'm
 
06:40:57.070 --> 06:40:57.080 align:start position:0%
not sure how I feel about the bill now
 
06:40:58.788 --> 06:40:58.798 align:start position:0%
uh I'm struggling
 
06:41:01.510 --> 06:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
with uh how standardized the test that
 
06:41:04.070 --> 06:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
one guy gets to the next I have a really
 
06:41:06.230 --> 06:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
hard time believing that you know three
 
06:41:08.510 --> 06:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
people listening to answers and nobody
 
06:41:08.520 --> 06:41:09.628 align:start position:0%
people listening to answers and nobody
ever

06:41:09.628 --> 06:41:09.638 align:start position:0%
ever
 
06:41:13.510 --> 06:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
disagrees um so and that they get no
 
06:41:19.030 --> 06:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
feedback on how they did or didn't do um
 
06:41:20.708 --> 06:41:20.718 align:start position:0%
I mean every time I took a test in
 
06:41:23.150 --> 06:41:23.160 align:start position:0%
college I I got the test back and it
 
06:41:25.350 --> 06:41:25.360 align:start position:0%
usually had Mar on I could go to the
 
06:41:27.150 --> 06:41:27.160 align:start position:0%
professor and say hey you know what did
 
06:41:29.948 --> 06:41:29.958 align:start position:0%
I mess up here and he'd sit down and
 
06:41:32.628 --> 06:41:32.638 align:start position:0%
tell me no Paul you know it's the the
 
06:41:34.230 --> 06:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
physics isn't right here you got to you
 
06:41:35.510 --> 06:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
got to you know approach it from a
 
06:41:37.990 --> 06:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
different direction um just that you
 
06:41:40.350 --> 06:41:40.360 align:start position:0%
know they walk in take an oil test and
 
06:41:42.190 --> 06:41:42.200 align:start position:0%
and and they get no
 
06:41:44.190 --> 06:41:44.200 align:start position:0%
feedback and I think there should be a
 
06:41:46.430 --> 06:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
study guide for any test you take
 
06:41:47.990 --> 06:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily have the answers but
 
06:41:49.990 --> 06:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
it should have an outline of the
 
06:41:52.388 --> 06:41:52.398 align:start position:0%
material and then you we can have
 
06:41:54.230 --> 06:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
practice test or not have practice test
 
06:41:55.910 --> 06:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
I don't need to practice test if I have
 
06:41:58.430 --> 06:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
a guide that tells me you know these are
 
06:42:00.270 --> 06:42:00.280 align:start position:0%
these are the topics and the areas that
 
06:42:03.548 --> 06:42:03.558 align:start position:0%
I need to concentrate that are in 50
 
06:42:07.948 --> 06:42:07.958 align:start position:0%
pages of the 500 you gave me um so yeah
 
06:42:10.548 --> 06:42:10.558 align:start position:0%
I'm really struggling with how I'm going
 
06:42:13.150 --> 06:42:13.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:16.150 --> 06:42:16.160 align:start position:0%
this representative
 
06:42:19.910 --> 06:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
DeVito so my husband is a license guide
 
06:42:21.910 --> 06:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
not just in New Hampshire but also Maine
 
06:42:24.510 --> 06:42:24.520 align:start position:0%
which is supposedly the hardest guide
 
06:42:27.430 --> 06:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
license to obtain in the United States
 
06:42:31.430 --> 06:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
um he failed it three times but um I sat
 
06:42:33.510 --> 06:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
there and watched him study um in
 
06:42:35.990 --> 06:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
between both of his jobs to ensure that
 
06:42:38.830 --> 06:42:38.840 align:start position:0%
he did pass it's not easy and that's on
 
06:42:42.190 --> 06:42:42.200 align:start position:0%
purpose because you are um you're in
 
06:42:43.990 --> 06:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
charge of other people's lives you're
 
06:42:45.388 --> 06:42:45.398 align:start position:0%
responsible for them whenever you're out
 
06:42:47.788 --> 06:42:47.798 align:start position:0%
there guiding them and that guides take
 
06:42:52.030 --> 06:42:52.040 align:start position:0%
that seriously um if this was a test
 
06:42:53.948 --> 06:42:53.958 align:start position:0%
that was easy I don't know that I would
 
06:42:55.788 --> 06:42:55.798 align:start position:0%
want to go with a guide and I wouldn't
 
06:42:58.388 --> 06:42:58.398 align:start position:0%
even respect it um right now it is
 
06:43:01.670 --> 06:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
highly respected um in the format that
 
06:43:03.270 --> 06:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
it is and my husband would come home
 
06:43:06.310 --> 06:43:06.320 align:start position:0%
whenever he failed and be so upset um on
 
06:43:09.670 --> 06:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
the oral he did complain about that um
 
06:43:11.150 --> 06:43:11.160 align:start position:0%
but the guys that were sitting there
 
06:43:13.350 --> 06:43:13.360 align:start position:0%
talking to him and testing him they did
 
06:43:15.868 --> 06:43:15.878 align:start position:0%
walk him through what he messed up on
 
06:43:18.230 --> 06:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
and he went back and studied he also
 
06:43:20.948 --> 06:43:20.958 align:start position:0%
there is a guide service that you can be
 
06:43:23.910 --> 06:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
a part of and he studied with that um
 
06:43:26.750 --> 06:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a class and he took that
 
06:43:29.670 --> 06:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
class um and so those things are out
 
06:43:32.510 --> 06:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
there for people that want them um he
 
06:43:34.868 --> 06:43:34.878 align:start position:0%
did have several books that he read and
 
06:43:37.310 --> 06:43:37.320 align:start position:0%
um he hunts he's been an avid Hunter um
 
06:43:40.708 --> 06:43:40.718 align:start position:0%
the last probably 20 years and um he was
 
06:43:43.030 --> 06:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
able to to finally get his guide license
 
06:43:47.270 --> 06:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
so it's not impossible um but those the
 
06:43:48.708 --> 06:43:48.718 align:start position:0%
the standard is very high and there's a
 
06:43:50.750 --> 06:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
reason for that so that is why I'm not
 
06:43:54.708 --> 06:43:54.718 align:start position:0%
in favor of um doing just a standardized
 
06:43:59.548 --> 06:43:59.558 align:start position:0%
test or um changing this also I think it
 
06:44:01.310 --> 06:44:01.320 align:start position:0%
needs to be known if you haven't taken a
 
06:44:04.030 --> 06:44:04.040 align:start position:0%
guide test there are a million
 
06:44:05.750 --> 06:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
possibilities of things that could
 
06:44:08.388 --> 06:44:08.398 align:start position:0%
happen on the water and in the woods
 
06:44:10.830 --> 06:44:10.840 align:start position:0%
there's not 10 things that they can put
 
06:44:12.750 --> 06:44:12.760 align:start position:0%
on a piece of paper and say these are
 
06:44:13.948 --> 06:44:13.958 align:start position:0%
the 10 things that you're going to run
 
06:44:16.110 --> 06:44:16.120 align:start position:0%
into whenever you're out guiding someone
 
06:44:17.270 --> 06:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
and so these are the things you need to
 
06:44:19.430 --> 06:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
study that's why there's a lot of books
 
06:44:21.110 --> 06:44:21.120 align:start position:0%
because there's all sorts of
 
06:44:24.070 --> 06:44:24.080 align:start position:0%
probabilities that could happen um
 
06:44:26.270 --> 06:44:26.280 align:start position:0%
whenever they are testing you out of the
 
06:44:28.430 --> 06:44:28.440 align:start position:0%
million they may test you or talk to you
 
06:44:28.440 --> 06:44:29.388 align:start position:0%
million they may test you or talk to you
about

06:44:29.388 --> 06:44:29.398 align:start position:0%
about
 
06:44:32.350 --> 06:44:32.360 align:start position:0%
10 um so there's nothing that they can't
 
06:44:35.310 --> 06:44:35.320 align:start position:0%
put on on a piece of paper um all of
 
06:44:38.070 --> 06:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
those and say hey here's here's the 10
 
06:44:39.510 --> 06:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
things that we're going to test you over
 
06:44:41.388 --> 06:44:41.398 align:start position:0%
they're going to change that um I know
 
06:44:42.708 --> 06:44:42.718 align:start position:0%
that my husband whenever he went in the
 
06:44:44.590 --> 06:44:44.600 align:start position:0%
three times they were different test all
 
06:44:44.600 --> 06:44:45.990 align:start position:0%
three times they were different test all
three

06:44:45.990 --> 06:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
three
 
06:44:46.000 --> 06:44:47.910 align:start position:0%
three
times

06:44:47.910 --> 06:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
times
 
06:44:50.990 --> 06:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
so representative Harvey thank you Mr
 
06:44:52.510 --> 06:44:52.520 align:start position:0%
chair I've been
 
06:44:57.510 --> 06:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
waiting you're very patient um so I
 
06:45:00.628 --> 06:45:00.638 align:start position:0%
agree I'm I'm I'm leaning more and more
 
06:45:02.548 --> 06:45:02.558 align:start position:0%
towards the itl thank you for your
 
06:45:02.558 --> 06:45:03.830 align:start position:0%
towards the itl thank you for your
comments

06:45:03.830 --> 06:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
comments
 
06:45:06.788 --> 06:45:06.798 align:start position:0%
although I don't think that it was ever
 
06:45:08.750 --> 06:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
the intent of this bill or any of the
 
06:45:11.910 --> 06:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
speakers to do away with the oral part
 
06:45:12.788 --> 06:45:12.798 align:start position:0%
of the
 
06:45:16.230 --> 06:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
test the it was just a a way to figure
 
06:45:18.510 --> 06:45:18.520 align:start position:0%
out a way that even the oral part could
 
06:45:21.590 --> 06:45:21.600 align:start position:0%
become more standardized um I liked the
 
06:45:24.230 --> 06:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
idea that on the oral part of the test
 
06:45:27.030 --> 06:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
it's not pass fail you get so many
 
06:45:31.510 --> 06:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
points um there there is a guide school
 
06:45:33.708 --> 06:45:33.718 align:start position:0%
so you can take advantage of that
 
06:45:37.150 --> 06:45:37.160 align:start position:0%
I I Heard lots of thing complaints about
 
06:45:40.868 --> 06:45:40.878 align:start position:0%
well you gave me 20 books to read um but
 
06:45:43.430 --> 06:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
um I don't know I got a lot of books to
 
06:45:45.270 --> 06:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
read when I was in college and I didn't
 
06:45:48.708 --> 06:45:48.718 align:start position:0%
think any of them applied to the test
 
06:45:52.788 --> 06:45:52.798 align:start position:0%
um right and I do hear you say that you
 
06:45:56.468 --> 06:45:56.478 align:start position:0%
know it it's it's hard to uh predict
 
06:45:58.190 --> 06:45:58.200 align:start position:0%
what things you're going
 
06:46:01.030 --> 06:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
to run up against out in the wilderness
 
06:46:03.190 --> 06:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
it could be anything so maybe 20 books
 
06:46:06.310 --> 06:46:06.320 align:start position:0%
is not even enough I do like the idea of
 
06:46:07.990 --> 06:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
an apprenticeship but we'll see that in
 
06:46:10.670 --> 06:46:10.680 align:start position:0%
a senate senate bill yeah when that
 
06:46:14.868 --> 06:46:14.878 align:start position:0%
comes um um uh so I I'm wondering you
 
06:46:16.350 --> 06:46:16.360 align:start position:0%
know there's not a lot of difference
 
06:46:18.670 --> 06:46:18.680 align:start position:0%
between what's going on now and what
 
06:46:22.670 --> 06:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
what we what this Bill is saying except
 
06:46:24.548 --> 06:46:24.558 align:start position:0%
that the test would be given by a
 
06:46:28.270 --> 06:46:28.280 align:start position:0%
fishing game officer instead of a guide
 
06:46:31.910 --> 06:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
because there there are tests online and
 
06:46:33.750 --> 06:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
the reason those tests are online is
 
06:46:36.388 --> 06:46:36.398 align:start position:0%
because last year when we saw this bill
 
06:46:38.750 --> 06:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
we made that suggestion that we're going
 
06:46:40.388 --> 06:46:40.398 align:start position:0%
to leave things the way they are but
 
06:46:43.110 --> 06:46:43.120 align:start position:0%
could you please put up some sort of
 
06:46:45.310 --> 06:46:45.320 align:start position:0%
online testing I am I I'm correct in
 
06:46:46.948 --> 06:46:46.958 align:start position:0%
that and I was actually going to verify
 
06:46:48.708 --> 06:46:48.718 align:start position:0%
that today but he made a comment about
 
06:46:52.388 --> 06:46:52.398 align:start position:0%
that before I even got to ask him so so
 
06:46:56.230 --> 06:46:56.240 align:start position:0%
my question I guess is um if we itl this
 
06:47:00.350 --> 06:47:00.360 align:start position:0%
bill can we make a um suggestion from
 
06:47:03.270 --> 06:47:03.280 align:start position:0%
the committee I I get the fishing can do
 
06:47:04.590 --> 06:47:04.600 align:start position:0%
what they want but can we make a
 
06:47:07.110 --> 06:47:07.120 align:start position:0%
suggestion from the committee that they
 
06:47:10.628 --> 06:47:10.638 align:start position:0%
go over the the answers that people have
 
06:47:13.230 --> 06:47:13.240 align:start position:0%
gotten wrong in the oral section I do
 
06:47:15.548 --> 06:47:15.558 align:start position:0%
think that's fair I you know whenever
 
06:47:17.310 --> 06:47:17.320 align:start position:0%
I've missed something somebody's told me
 
06:47:18.628 --> 06:47:18.638 align:start position:0%
believe me they love to tell me what I
 
06:47:22.310 --> 06:47:22.320 align:start position:0%
do wrong so um I'm wondering if if we do
 
06:47:24.948 --> 06:47:24.958 align:start position:0%
itl this if we could just as a as a
 
06:47:28.548 --> 06:47:28.558 align:start position:0%
committee make the recommendation that
 
06:47:31.350 --> 06:47:31.360 align:start position:0%
in future oral tests the tester goes
 
06:47:33.468 --> 06:47:33.478 align:start position:0%
over with the teste
 
06:47:36.750 --> 06:47:36.760 align:start position:0%
why your answer was not acceptable
 
06:47:40.230 --> 06:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
answer would is that a weird idea not at
 
06:47:43.628 --> 06:47:43.638 align:start position:0%
all thank you very much representative
 
06:47:46.548 --> 06:47:46.558 align:start position:0%
Khan thank you Mr chairman Mr chairman
 
06:47:48.430 --> 06:47:48.440 align:start position:0%
I'm a very big supporter of the
 
06:47:50.948 --> 06:47:50.958 align:start position:0%
commission and the
 
06:47:55.990 --> 06:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
department um always uh but in this case
 
06:47:58.788 --> 06:47:58.798 align:start position:0%
um I am very concerned about just two
 
06:47:59.948 --> 06:47:59.958 align:start position:0%
member of
 
06:48:05.750 --> 06:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
the uh interview or uh the commission
 
06:48:07.788 --> 06:48:07.798 align:start position:0%
that who took take care of the
 
06:48:11.270 --> 06:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
licensing uh the other thing is uh the
 
06:48:14.030 --> 06:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
last year when we to took the testimony
 
06:48:15.868 --> 06:48:15.878 align:start position:0%
it was many many people you know
 
06:48:18.948 --> 06:48:18.958 align:start position:0%
testified in front of us uh uh the
 
06:48:21.510 --> 06:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
commission had U opportunity and chance
 
06:48:25.628 --> 06:48:25.638 align:start position:0%
to fix some of those concern this year
 
06:48:29.070 --> 06:48:29.080 align:start position:0%
the problem didn't go way uh the prime
 
06:48:32.430 --> 06:48:32.440 align:start position:0%
sponsor is so so passionate about it
 
06:48:35.150 --> 06:48:35.160 align:start position:0%
because her district and the citizens of
 
06:48:38.388 --> 06:48:38.398 align:start position:0%
our state that she brought out a better
 
06:48:41.230 --> 06:48:41.240 align:start position:0%
bill I am confused now that what how I'm
 
06:48:42.708 --> 06:48:42.718 align:start position:0%
going to
 
06:48:45.948 --> 06:48:45.958 align:start position:0%
vote thank you representative
 
06:48:49.070 --> 06:48:49.080 align:start position:0%
Fox couple quick things first of all uh
 
06:48:51.190 --> 06:48:51.200 align:start position:0%
to your point about a million things
 
06:48:52.868 --> 06:48:52.878 align:start position:0%
that mother nature could theoretically
 
06:48:55.468 --> 06:48:55.478 align:start position:0%
throw at you um 20 books probably isn't
 
06:48:58.548 --> 06:48:58.558 align:start position:0%
enough um and and no two tests are going
 
06:49:00.670 --> 06:49:00.680 align:start position:0%
to be the same um I'm coming at it from
 
06:49:02.310 --> 06:49:02.320 align:start position:0%
a standpoint of I have a 15-year-old
 
06:49:04.750 --> 06:49:04.760 align:start position:0%
daughter who all of her friends are in
 
06:49:05.990 --> 06:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
the process of trying to get the
 
06:49:08.388 --> 06:49:08.398 align:start position:0%
driver's licenses and everybody who
 
06:49:10.468 --> 06:49:10.478 align:start position:0%
doesn't pass has a complaint or says
 
06:49:12.708 --> 06:49:12.718 align:start position:0%
this TMV is harder you got that guy he
 
06:49:15.990 --> 06:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
was harder she's easy so there's always
 
06:49:18.868 --> 06:49:18.878 align:start position:0%
going to be that sort of degree of
 
06:49:22.670 --> 06:49:22.680 align:start position:0%
difference among tests situations all of
 
06:49:24.990 --> 06:49:25.000 align:start position:0%
that and there's no amount of correction
 
06:49:27.110 --> 06:49:27.120 align:start position:0%
that we can do that that really would
 
06:49:28.948 --> 06:49:28.958 align:start position:0%
mitigate that outside of standardizing
 
06:49:32.230 --> 06:49:32.240 align:start position:0%
it which I think defeats the purpose of
 
06:49:34.388 --> 06:49:34.398 align:start position:0%
M and and the point of the fact that
 
06:49:36.070 --> 06:49:36.080 align:start position:0%
when you're in nature anything can
 
06:49:37.430 --> 06:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
happen and you have to be prepared for
 
06:49:38.670 --> 06:49:38.680 align:start position:0%
all of it because you have the lives of
 
06:49:40.548 --> 06:49:40.558 align:start position:0%
the people that you're with uh that
 
06:49:42.990 --> 06:49:43.000 align:start position:0%
you're responsible
 
06:49:46.628 --> 06:49:46.638 align:start position:0%
for I can empathize with you my middle
 
06:49:50.510 --> 06:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
child failed his driving test three
 
06:49:54.150 --> 06:49:54.160 align:start position:0%
times to be clear just in case she or
 
06:49:55.948 --> 06:49:55.958 align:start position:0%
her friends happen to be super bored and
 
06:49:58.310 --> 06:49:58.320 align:start position:0%
watching this she has not failed it
 
06:50:02.310 --> 06:50:02.320 align:start position:0%
yet my suggestion to my ex-wife was to
 
06:50:04.150 --> 06:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
ask him to please remember the route he
 
06:50:07.388 --> 06:50:07.398 align:start position:0%
drives and go out there every day after
 
06:50:09.190 --> 06:50:09.200 align:start position:0%
school and let him drive it because the
 
06:50:10.510 --> 06:50:10.520 align:start position:0%
more comfortable with that route he
 
06:50:12.468 --> 06:50:12.478 align:start position:0%
becomes the less likely he is to get
 
06:50:14.548 --> 06:50:14.558 align:start position:0%
nervous and make a mistake because I
 
06:50:16.110 --> 06:50:16.120 align:start position:0%
know my son and I knew that every time
 
06:50:17.628 --> 06:50:17.638 align:start position:0%
he made a mistake it was because he was
 
06:50:21.190 --> 06:50:21.200 align:start position:0%
so nervous about not failing that he put
 
06:50:22.670 --> 06:50:22.680 align:start position:0%
himself into a corner where he would
 
06:50:25.110 --> 06:50:25.120 align:start position:0%
fail and he finally passed it because he
 
06:50:27.788 --> 06:50:27.798 align:start position:0%
drove that same route so often that he
 
06:50:30.030 --> 06:50:30.040 align:start position:0%
was very comfortable doing
 
06:50:33.190 --> 06:50:33.200 align:start position:0%
it uh representative love it I I
 
06:50:35.750 --> 06:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate this conversation this is
 
06:50:37.310 --> 06:50:37.320 align:start position:0%
what I was looking
 
06:50:40.910 --> 06:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
for I I would be in I I think the other
 
06:50:43.190 --> 06:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
thing that I think is important it
 
06:50:44.548 --> 06:50:44.558 align:start position:0%
sounds like several of the issues
 
06:50:47.708 --> 06:50:47.718 align:start position:0%
haven't been addressed over the past 12
 
06:50:49.868 --> 06:50:49.878 align:start position:0%
months or
 
06:50:52.350 --> 06:50:52.360 align:start position:0%
longer what we've also heard that
 
06:50:54.910 --> 06:50:54.920 align:start position:0%
fishing game doesn't have the people
 
06:50:57.388 --> 06:50:57.398 align:start position:0%
power the manpower to to take this
 
06:50:57.398 --> 06:50:58.750 align:start position:0%
power the manpower to to take this
responsibility

06:50:58.750 --> 06:50:58.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
06:51:02.788 --> 06:51:02.798 align:start position:0%
on and I think for that reason alone itl
 
06:51:04.510 --> 06:51:04.520 align:start position:0%
is the way to
 
06:51:07.510 --> 06:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
go thank you representative
 
06:51:10.590 --> 06:51:10.600 align:start position:0%
wette just one quick uh
 
06:51:13.670 --> 06:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
statement the um having the fishing game
 
06:51:17.230 --> 06:51:17.240 align:start position:0%
officers uh do the oral part of the test
 
06:51:19.190 --> 06:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
is it doesn't quite sit right with me
 
06:51:21.510 --> 06:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
because the guys are the experts in
 
06:51:23.708 --> 06:51:23.718 align:start position:0%
guiding not the fishing game officers
 
06:51:25.510 --> 06:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
they have know their job and they know
 
06:51:26.990 --> 06:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
but what the guides know the guiding
 
06:51:29.270 --> 06:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
business and I think that they have to
 
06:51:33.190 --> 06:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:35.830 --> 06:51:35.840 align:start position:0%
representative tutor yeah I mean for me
 
06:51:37.468 --> 06:51:37.478 align:start position:0%
it comes back to feedback I mean you
 
06:51:39.270 --> 06:51:39.280 align:start position:0%
said your husband failed three times but
 
06:51:41.310 --> 06:51:41.320 align:start position:0%
you got feedback each time he failed so
 
06:51:44.190 --> 06:51:44.200 align:start position:0%
that he had some idea of where he was
 
06:51:47.788 --> 06:51:47.798 align:start position:0%
deficient um and perhaps the guys can
 
06:51:49.948 --> 06:51:49.958 align:start position:0%
chime back in and that they do give
 
06:51:52.110 --> 06:51:52.120 align:start position:0%
feedback I haven't heard that I believe
 
06:51:55.070 --> 06:51:55.080 align:start position:0%
that they do not um and that's really
 
06:51:57.910 --> 06:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
the big thing for me if if they were
 
06:51:59.388 --> 06:51:59.398 align:start position:0%
receiving some sort of feedback I don't
 
06:52:01.430 --> 06:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
want to make a test easy and lose 10
 
06:52:04.070 --> 06:52:04.080 align:start position:0%
people in the woods next year here but I
 
06:52:05.548 --> 06:52:05.558 align:start position:0%
think it's just fair to give people
 
06:52:07.708 --> 06:52:07.718 align:start position:0%
feedback on where they're deficient and
 
06:52:09.350 --> 06:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
where they failed let's clear up the
 
06:52:10.910 --> 06:52:10.920 align:start position:0%
question of feedback and ask the person
 
06:52:17.510 --> 06:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:21.150 --> 06:52:21.160 align:start position:0%
feedback thank you um so when we started
 
06:52:23.430 --> 06:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
this process we actually did give
 
06:52:27.388 --> 06:52:27.398 align:start position:0%
feedback um detailed feedback to the uh
 
06:52:30.110 --> 06:52:30.120 align:start position:0%
applicant the problem is these tests are
 
06:52:31.990 --> 06:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
between they're about a year in
 
06:52:32.000 --> 06:52:33.110 align:start position:0%
between they're about a year in
development

06:52:33.110 --> 06:52:33.120 align:start position:0%
development
 
06:52:34.788 --> 06:52:34.798 align:start position:0%
it takes us about a year to come up with
 
06:52:38.230 --> 06:52:38.240 align:start position:0%
a with the the oral board and it's to
 
06:52:40.310 --> 06:52:40.320 align:start position:0%
complete a test run it through all of
 
06:52:45.070 --> 06:52:45.080 align:start position:0%
those verification uh stages so as soon
 
06:52:47.830 --> 06:52:47.840 align:start position:0%
as we give the answers the test is blown
 
06:52:52.150 --> 06:52:52.160 align:start position:0%
up so if if for instance I said you know
 
06:52:56.110 --> 06:52:56.120 align:start position:0%
you you have a scenario where
 
06:53:00.468 --> 06:53:00.478 align:start position:0%
uh trying not to give up a test
 
06:53:02.750 --> 06:53:02.760 align:start position:0%
um you got a hook in the ear we haven't
 
06:53:04.708 --> 06:53:04.718 align:start position:0%
used this one for a long time and I give
 
06:53:07.190 --> 06:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
you the correct answer to that as soon
 
06:53:09.430 --> 06:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
as I tell you how to deal with it I can
 
06:53:12.310 --> 06:53:12.320 align:start position:0%
never use that scenario again so the
 
06:53:15.350 --> 06:53:15.360 align:start position:0%
test and and the way the system works is
 
06:53:17.468 --> 06:53:17.478 align:start position:0%
the guide School actually it's it would
 
06:53:20.830 --> 06:53:20.840 align:start position:0%
be more uh suitably called a test
 
06:53:24.230 --> 06:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
preparation school um as well as a guide
 
06:53:28.030 --> 06:53:28.040 align:start position:0%
school so they are really anxious to get
 
06:53:31.270 --> 06:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
folks through the process so as soon as
 
06:53:33.548 --> 06:53:33.558 align:start position:0%
we gave them those answ answers we found
 
06:53:35.628 --> 06:53:35.638 align:start position:0%
that the next person that came
 
06:53:38.750 --> 06:53:38.760 align:start position:0%
back actually challenged me because I
 
06:53:41.110 --> 06:53:41.120 align:start position:0%
didn't have the right person go get the
 
06:53:44.708 --> 06:53:44.718 align:start position:0%
wood the next time so it it is
 
06:53:48.270 --> 06:53:48.280 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we don't give the answers
 
06:53:52.310 --> 06:53:52.320 align:start position:0%
um and in some cases it's very difficult
 
06:53:55.948 --> 06:53:55.958 align:start position:0%
um I will I will say to
 
06:53:58.510 --> 06:53:58.520 align:start position:0%
clarify a little bit with this 20
 
06:53:59.670 --> 06:53:59.680 align:start position:0%
there's 20
 
06:54:02.670 --> 06:54:02.680 align:start position:0%
books um and there's probably more um um
 
06:54:04.190 --> 06:54:04.200 align:start position:0%
because one of them is a group of
 
06:54:06.750 --> 06:54:06.760 align:start position:0%
pamphlets that's that's probably 30 I
 
06:54:09.830 --> 06:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
think count of 37 of pamphlets um
 
06:54:13.388 --> 06:54:13.398 align:start position:0%
however there is a sample test online uh
 
06:54:16.310 --> 06:54:16.320 align:start position:0%
two sample tests one of each of the two
 
06:54:18.830 --> 06:54:18.840 align:start position:0%
uh types of tests it's given
 
06:54:23.670 --> 06:54:23.680 align:start position:0%
and I I don't know what else um we tried
 
06:54:25.468 --> 06:54:25.478 align:start position:0%
to give the we tried to give feedback
 
06:54:28.830 --> 06:54:28.840 align:start position:0%
detailed feedback to get folks ready to
 
06:54:30.150 --> 06:54:30.160 align:start position:0%
pass but it turned out that we had to
 
06:54:34.190 --> 06:54:34.200 align:start position:0%
make up new tests every single 6
 
06:54:37.070 --> 06:54:37.080 align:start position:0%
months one second did that get worse
 
06:54:39.070 --> 06:54:39.080 align:start position:0%
with the
 
06:54:39.080 --> 06:54:42.190 align:start position:0%
with the
Internet

06:54:42.190 --> 06:54:42.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:44.190 --> 06:54:44.200 align:start position:0%
it's I don't want to get into the
 
06:54:46.110 --> 06:54:46.120 align:start position:0%
business of folks that are involved in
 
06:54:50.030 --> 06:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
this process but it's more immediate
 
06:54:52.708 --> 06:54:52.718 align:start position:0%
than that okay I we have given a test
 
06:54:58.270 --> 06:54:58.280 align:start position:0%
at8 used the same test at three and
 
06:55:00.190 --> 06:55:00.200 align:start position:0%
miraculously the people who took it to
 
06:55:04.150 --> 06:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
three passed wow so representative tutor
 
06:55:06.948 --> 06:55:06.958 align:start position:0%
then Harvey yeah and thank you Mr chair
 
06:55:08.868 --> 06:55:08.878 align:start position:0%
thank you again for taking my question
 
06:55:10.190 --> 06:55:10.200 align:start position:0%
I'm not looking for you to give the
 
06:55:11.948 --> 06:55:11.958 align:start position:0%
answer but I'm looking for you to point
 
06:55:15.510 --> 06:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
out the area that he is deficient in was
 
06:55:16.430 --> 06:55:16.440 align:start position:0%
well you
 
06:55:19.750 --> 06:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
failed crawling on the ice not that you
 
06:55:21.990 --> 06:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
failed you didn't look at the stars or
 
06:55:23.510 --> 06:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
you didn't have a rope behind you you
 
06:55:26.590 --> 06:55:26.600 align:start position:0%
didn't use a kayak to go out there um
 
06:55:29.430 --> 06:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
okay you took your four-wheeler you just
 
06:55:31.230 --> 06:55:31.240 align:start position:0%
this is the area that you failed in so
 
06:55:32.708 --> 06:55:32.718 align:start position:0%
did he go back and review that
 
06:55:35.910 --> 06:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
particular book or section of material
 
06:55:37.350 --> 06:55:37.360 align:start position:0%
and know that okay I got got to
 
06:55:39.110 --> 06:55:39.120 align:start position:0%
strengthen myself here so that's all I'm
 
06:55:40.430 --> 06:55:40.440 align:start position:0%
looking for I'm not looking for you to
 
06:55:43.948 --> 06:55:43.958 align:start position:0%
say you know you failed one plus one and
 
06:55:46.548 --> 06:55:46.558 align:start position:0%
you put three in the answer is two
 
06:55:50.468 --> 06:55:50.478 align:start position:0%
right representative Harvey and and I
 
06:55:51.750 --> 06:55:51.760 align:start position:0%
since we're discussing I don't think
 
06:55:55.788 --> 06:55:55.798 align:start position:0%
this has to be a question but um I agree
 
06:55:57.708 --> 06:55:57.718 align:start position:0%
there's way ways to give feedback
 
06:55:59.510 --> 06:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
without giving the answer for instance
 
06:56:01.708 --> 06:56:01.718 align:start position:0%
you can make the recommendation well for
 
06:56:03.628 --> 06:56:03.638 align:start position:0%
perhaps you need to go back and read
 
06:56:07.468 --> 06:56:07.478 align:start position:0%
book number two one more time and that's
 
06:56:10.510 --> 06:56:10.520 align:start position:0%
even less of um feedback than what what
 
06:56:13.708 --> 06:56:13.718 align:start position:0%
you're suggesting but and and it as to
 
06:56:16.830 --> 06:56:16.840 align:start position:0%
this situation of well you you give them
 
06:56:18.350 --> 06:56:18.360 align:start position:0%
feedback at nine o'clock and then the
 
06:56:20.310 --> 06:56:20.320 align:start position:0%
person that takes the test at 3:00
 
06:56:23.150 --> 06:56:23.160 align:start position:0%
passes it then you can simply say if you
 
06:56:25.310 --> 06:56:25.320 align:start position:0%
want to know you know what what you need
 
06:56:27.670 --> 06:56:27.680 align:start position:0%
to study more of come back at 5 and
 
06:56:30.590 --> 06:56:30.600 align:start position:0%
we'll go over your test with you the as
 
06:56:32.830 --> 06:56:32.840 align:start position:0%
an educator for 43 years there's ways to
 
06:56:34.868 --> 06:56:34.878 align:start position:0%
get around everything that you're saying
 
06:56:38.230 --> 06:56:38.240 align:start position:0%
and still be fair to the person who is
 
06:56:40.190 --> 06:56:40.200 align:start position:0%
taking the test and give them feedback
 
06:56:42.388 --> 06:56:42.398 align:start position:0%
so that they can take the test three
 
06:56:45.670 --> 06:56:45.680 align:start position:0%
times or whatever representative DeVito
 
06:56:47.350 --> 06:56:47.360 align:start position:0%
I wanted to clarify my husband whenever
 
06:56:49.510 --> 06:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
he said that he did receive feedback um
 
06:56:51.868 --> 06:56:51.878 align:start position:0%
one of the things that he did not pass
 
06:56:54.708 --> 06:56:54.718 align:start position:0%
on was the compass portion um and that
 
06:56:56.070 --> 06:56:56.080 align:start position:0%
was not one of his strong suits he knew
 
06:56:58.350 --> 06:56:58.360 align:start position:0%
that going into it um and that is the
 
06:57:01.350 --> 06:57:01.360 align:start position:0%
part that he failed so he knew um so I
 
06:57:03.110 --> 06:57:03.120 align:start position:0%
believe from my understanding with my
 
06:57:05.788 --> 06:57:05.798 align:start position:0%
husband if you fail a certain part the
 
06:57:09.468 --> 06:57:09.478 align:start position:0%
test is over so at that time you know
 
06:57:11.830 --> 06:57:11.840 align:start position:0%
that's you know you may you may suck at
 
06:57:13.468 --> 06:57:13.478 align:start position:0%
other things on the test as well but you
 
06:57:15.430 --> 06:57:15.440 align:start position:0%
know that for sure you got to go back
 
06:57:17.708 --> 06:57:17.718 align:start position:0%
and study the compass so um that's what
 
06:57:19.070 --> 06:57:19.080 align:start position:0%
I me I just wanted to clarify they did
 
06:57:20.270 --> 06:57:20.280 align:start position:0%
not give him the answers they didn't
 
06:57:21.468 --> 06:57:21.478 align:start position:0%
write anything down they didn't give him
 
06:57:25.350 --> 06:57:25.360 align:start position:0%
anything specific it was just that
 
06:57:28.628 --> 06:57:28.638 align:start position:0%
portion any other discussion
 
06:57:30.868 --> 06:57:30.878 align:start position:0%
items representative
 
06:57:35.270 --> 06:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
Jacobs thank you you um I I feel like
 
06:57:36.750 --> 06:57:36.760 align:start position:0%
what I'm really hearing is that there's
 
06:57:38.628 --> 06:57:38.638 align:start position:0%
a huge there there's a big difference
 
06:57:40.190 --> 06:57:40.200 align:start position:0%
between a guide and a fishing game
 
06:57:43.788 --> 06:57:43.798 align:start position:0%
conservation officer um so I'm wondering
 
06:57:45.510 --> 06:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
how different is the training of a fish
 
06:57:48.628 --> 06:57:48.638 align:start position:0%
and game officer from a guide um I would
 
06:57:50.190 --> 06:57:50.200 align:start position:0%
really expect that they'd really have
 
06:57:52.670 --> 06:57:52.680 align:start position:0%
some of the same skill sets especially
 
06:57:55.110 --> 06:57:55.120 align:start position:0%
if ficient game officers um are
 
06:57:58.110 --> 06:57:58.120 align:start position:0%
performing rescues you know isn't that
 
06:57:59.310 --> 06:57:59.320 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering what the differences
 
06:58:00.788 --> 06:58:00.798 align:start position:0%
are because to me it seems like there
 
06:58:03.990 --> 06:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
should be a significant amount of
 
06:58:06.948 --> 06:58:06.958 align:start position:0%
overlap thank you Colonel Jordan would
 
06:58:09.468 --> 06:58:09.478 align:start position:0%
you like to step up and tell us what
 
06:58:12.708 --> 06:58:12.718 align:start position:0%
kind of training so you actually I make
 
06:58:15.590 --> 06:58:15.600 align:start position:0%
them take the guys test so that's how we
 
06:58:18.468 --> 06:58:18.478 align:start position:0%
tested this whole procedure is I I once
 
06:58:20.388 --> 06:58:20.398 align:start position:0%
we created these exams I put them out to
 
06:58:21.750 --> 06:58:21.760 align:start position:0%
the field force and had them take them
 
06:58:23.388 --> 06:58:23.398 align:start position:0%
and scored them so we could make sure
 
06:58:25.270 --> 06:58:25.280 align:start position:0%
that we weren't producing something that
 
06:58:27.270 --> 06:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
wasn't going to be able to be passed
 
06:58:29.430 --> 06:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
they are capable of being guides I
 
06:58:31.868 --> 06:58:31.878 align:start position:0%
encourage them not to be because it's
 
06:58:34.948 --> 06:58:34.958 align:start position:0%
very easy to have a conflict there uh if
 
06:58:36.750 --> 06:58:36.760 align:start position:0%
they're a paid guide on Saturday when
 
06:58:38.310 --> 06:58:38.320 align:start position:0%
they're on a day off and Friday they're
 
06:58:39.868 --> 06:58:39.878 align:start position:0%
working because no matter how honest
 
06:58:42.110 --> 06:58:42.120 align:start position:0%
they are they're going to be looking for
 
06:58:43.670 --> 06:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
places while they're working that they
 
06:58:46.230 --> 06:58:46.240 align:start position:0%
can guide in for the weekend so we don't
 
06:58:47.910 --> 06:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
allow them to be guides what where I
 
06:58:50.230 --> 06:58:50.240 align:start position:0%
would have a problem I don't have the
 
06:58:52.510 --> 06:58:52.520 align:start position:0%
staff to put five officers commit them
 
06:58:55.750 --> 06:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
to this guiding test so um number one
 
06:58:58.430 --> 06:58:58.440 align:start position:0%
and number two uh I think it's important
 
06:59:01.310 --> 06:59:01.320 align:start position:0%
to have a and I think representative
 
06:59:02.590 --> 06:59:02.600 align:start position:0%
Tudor mentioned I think it's important
 
06:59:04.388 --> 06:59:04.398 align:start position:0%
to have a member of the guides
 
06:59:06.190 --> 06:59:06.200 align:start position:0%
Association involved because they're the
 
06:59:08.628 --> 06:59:08.638 align:start position:0%
ones actually doing it much like a fire
 
06:59:10.788 --> 06:59:10.798 align:start position:0%
department promotional board where you
 
06:59:12.948 --> 06:59:12.958 align:start position:0%
put firemen on the on that board I think
 
06:59:15.430 --> 06:59:15.440 align:start position:0%
that's an important piece to that so and
 
06:59:17.548 --> 06:59:17.558 align:start position:0%
I I'm I wasn't here and I apologize I
 
06:59:19.590 --> 06:59:19.600 align:start position:0%
was downstairs beating the table on
 
06:59:23.030 --> 06:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
another very important bill to me but um
 
06:59:24.628 --> 06:59:24.638 align:start position:0%
you I want to make sure you understand
 
06:59:26.708 --> 06:59:26.718 align:start position:0%
there's a ton of people that pass this
 
06:59:28.708 --> 06:59:28.718 align:start position:0%
so we have some great successes with us
 
06:59:30.350 --> 06:59:30.360 align:start position:0%
I realize not everybody does there are
 
06:59:31.628 --> 06:59:31.638 align:start position:0%
people that struggle with it but don't
 
06:59:33.190 --> 06:59:33.200 align:start position:0%
lose sight of the fact there's a ton of
 
06:59:34.590 --> 06:59:34.600 align:start position:0%
people that have passed this and it's
 
06:59:37.310 --> 06:59:37.320 align:start position:0%
worked very well so and we've taken
 
06:59:40.190 --> 06:59:40.200 align:start position:0%
steps the guides Association put on that
 
06:59:41.788 --> 06:59:41.798 align:start position:0%
have has got that bill coming towards
 
06:59:44.110 --> 06:59:44.120 align:start position:0%
you for a guides apprentice license
 
06:59:46.030 --> 06:59:46.040 align:start position:0%
which I think will help it'll get guides
 
06:59:47.990 --> 06:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
out that want to take this test ahead of
 
06:59:49.430 --> 06:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
time to work with a guide much like our
 
06:59:50.830 --> 06:59:50.840 align:start position:0%
hunter Apprentice which has worked
 
06:59:53.468 --> 06:59:53.478 align:start position:0%
really well uh we put the test online
 
06:59:55.070 --> 06:59:55.080 align:start position:0%
based on our testimony from the last
 
06:59:57.788 --> 06:59:57.798 align:start position:0%
time this bill came uh David helped us
 
06:59:59.670 --> 06:59:59.680 align:start position:0%
and we did that that's up online so
 
07:00:02.070 --> 07:00:02.080 align:start position:0%
people can see a good example there are
 
07:00:04.350 --> 07:00:04.360 align:start position:0%
instate resources they're not cheap
 
07:00:06.230 --> 07:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
they're schools that people can attend
 
07:00:07.708 --> 07:00:07.718 align:start position:0%
I'm really thrilled to hear that the
 
07:00:09.708 --> 07:00:09.718 align:start position:0%
clerk's husband failed that's really
 
07:00:11.270 --> 07:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
that kind of was important to know
 
07:00:13.670 --> 07:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
before I got here I I apologize to him
 
07:00:14.830 --> 07:00:14.840 align:start position:0%
and I hope he comes back and you're
 
07:00:14.840 --> 07:00:16.030 align:start position:0%
and I hope he comes back and you're
absolutely

07:00:16.030 --> 07:00:16.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
07:00:18.110 --> 07:00:18.120 align:start position:0%
right yeah and you're absolutely and
 
07:00:19.388 --> 07:00:19.398 align:start position:0%
that's what happens a lot of time you're
 
07:00:20.990 --> 07:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely right when they fail a
 
07:00:23.350 --> 07:00:23.360 align:start position:0%
section the test stops and so you they
 
07:00:25.788 --> 07:00:25.798 align:start position:0%
leave I am convinced they leave with an
 
07:00:27.910 --> 07:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
idea of what went wrong they may not
 
07:00:29.310 --> 07:00:29.320 align:start position:0%
know the exact question but they know
 
07:00:31.590 --> 07:00:31.600 align:start position:0%
what area they're weak in um and I've
 
07:00:34.270 --> 07:00:34.280 align:start position:0%
never taking a test frankly when I left
 
07:00:36.110 --> 07:00:36.120 align:start position:0%
that I didn't know what I needed to Bone
 
07:00:38.868 --> 07:00:38.878 align:start position:0%
up on you know that going in so the
 
07:00:40.270 --> 07:00:40.280 align:start position:0%
thing I like about it think guides
 
07:00:41.788 --> 07:00:41.798 align:start position:0%
Association likes about is it brought
 
07:00:43.948 --> 07:00:43.958 align:start position:0%
guides to a level that New Hampshire had
 
07:00:45.708 --> 07:00:45.718 align:start position:0%
never seen before so before we had a
 
07:00:48.110 --> 07:00:48.120 align:start position:0%
standardized test single written test it
 
07:00:50.510 --> 07:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
was everybody knew what it was we'd used
 
07:00:52.070 --> 07:00:52.080 align:start position:0%
it for years you come in sit down take
 
07:00:53.310 --> 07:00:53.320 align:start position:0%
the test and went out the door as a
 
07:00:55.590 --> 07:00:55.600 align:start position:0%
guide it was frightening so now we make
 
07:00:57.548 --> 07:00:57.558 align:start position:0%
sure they can navigate they have some
 
07:00:59.468 --> 07:00:59.478 align:start position:0%
first aid skills they can operate on the
 
07:01:01.430 --> 07:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
water it's just more responsible I think
 
07:01:02.788 --> 07:01:02.798 align:start position:0%
and one last thing I want to leave you
 
07:01:04.910 --> 07:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
with at 34 years of doing this I've
 
07:01:08.070 --> 07:01:08.080 align:start position:0%
never done a Rescue Mission in search of
 
07:01:10.670 --> 07:01:10.680 align:start position:0%
a guide or his client in the state of
 
07:01:13.150 --> 07:01:13.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I think that's commendable
 
07:01:15.230 --> 07:01:15.240 align:start position:0%
um that tells me that our guides are
 
07:01:16.868 --> 07:01:16.878 align:start position:0%
pretty good at what they do we've never
 
07:01:19.310 --> 07:01:19.320 align:start position:0%
had one and I think this will only this
 
07:01:21.030 --> 07:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
program will only help to enhance that
 
07:01:24.310 --> 07:01:24.320 align:start position:0%
for future Generations so thank you
 
07:01:26.708 --> 07:01:26.718 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
07:01:28.628 --> 07:01:28.638 align:start position:0%
Durkin well first of all I raised my
 
07:01:30.110 --> 07:01:30.120 align:start position:0%
hand because I was feeling left out
 
07:01:31.628 --> 07:01:31.638 align:start position:0%
because everybody's been speaking I had
 
07:01:34.990 --> 07:01:35.000 align:start position:0%
a chance yet so so here's my chance um I
 
07:01:36.230 --> 07:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
spent enough time in the woods and on
 
07:01:40.110 --> 07:01:40.120 align:start position:0%
the water to know that you don't become
 
07:01:42.230 --> 07:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
a guide by reading a couple books that
 
07:01:43.350 --> 07:01:43.360 align:start position:0%
you need to put your time in in the
 
07:01:46.030 --> 07:01:46.040 align:start position:0%
woods or on the water yes sir and I
 
07:01:48.590 --> 07:01:48.600 align:start position:0%
think that um I will be voting against
 
07:01:51.868 --> 07:01:51.878 align:start position:0%
this because who better to administer a
 
07:01:51.878 --> 07:01:53.430 align:start position:0%
this because who better to administer a
test

07:01:53.430 --> 07:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
test
 
07:01:56.788 --> 07:01:56.798 align:start position:0%
than somebody who has spent the time put
 
07:02:00.788 --> 07:02:00.798 align:start position:0%
the time in um and is an expert at what
 
07:02:03.910 --> 07:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
they do right um therefore I I'm going
 
07:02:05.750 --> 07:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
