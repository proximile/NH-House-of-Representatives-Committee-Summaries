00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr CH chair my name my name is
 
00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:45.160 align:start position:0%
an Gerald and I'm the uh director of
 
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
host committee services and Deborah uh
 
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
Charles who is our Deputy Chief of Staff
 
00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
have planned to be here as well but
 
00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:55.160 align:start position:0%
unfortunately she's stuck somewhere
 
00:06:58.029 --> 00:06:58.039 align:start position:0%
waiting for a plane somewhere so she
 
00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:02.560 align:start position:0%
could not make it um but I did uh we we
 
00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
she and I have been in touch all morning
 
00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:06.479 align:start position:0%
make sure that we had um I I would have
 
00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:08.840 align:start position:0%
information that was up to the date for
 
00:07:12.909 --> 00:07:12.919 align:start position:0%
you uh the first item um under the up
 
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
update on assignments by staff is that
 
00:07:17.909 --> 00:07:17.919 align:start position:0%
we're still working on the master list
 
00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
and we hope to have um more progress
 
00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
more um give you an update on our
 
00:07:25.629 --> 00:07:25.639 align:start position:0%
progress at our next meeting because it
 
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
is a lot of work as we're trying to pull
 
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
this entire them uh together and we are
 
00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:33.440 align:start position:0%
having staff meetings uh weekly in the
 
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
background on this um project so on
 
00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
October 16th we hope to have more
 
00:07:43.189 --> 00:07:43.199 align:start position:0%
information for you um under the
 
00:07:45.749 --> 00:07:45.759 align:start position:0%
continuing education program we
 
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
recognized that Thursday October 12th
 
00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:49.360 align:start position:0%
was not going to be possible because we
 
00:07:51.309 --> 00:07:51.319 align:start position:0%
had so many chairs who mentioned that
 
00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:53.360 align:start position:0%
they really need that date uh for
 
00:07:55.749 --> 00:07:55.759 align:start position:0%
retained bills
 
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
so um we thought of um December 14th um
 
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
the speaker thought this would be a good
 
00:08:04.629 --> 00:08:04.639 align:start position:0%
plan as that's when we will have the
 
00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:07.960 align:start position:0%
continuing education on um study
 
00:08:09.309 --> 00:08:09.319 align:start position:0%
committees and
 
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:13.560 align:start position:0%
commissions um so it's not that far away
 
00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
um and it will be a very vital program
 
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
we did just so people know we gave you a
 
00:08:20.469 --> 00:08:20.479 align:start position:0%
handout our last meeting um I'll make
 
00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:22.240 align:start position:0%
sure you get one rep vable that was
 
00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:24.520 align:start position:0%
encompassing um what we thought would be
 
00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:27.080 align:start position:0%
a good proposal for that program and
 
00:08:28.589 --> 00:08:28.599 align:start position:0%
it's based on other programs we've done
 
00:08:30.309 --> 00:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
in the past
 
00:08:32.949 --> 00:08:32.959 align:start position:0%
and then the most recent item that we've
 
00:08:36.509 --> 00:08:36.519 align:start position:0%
given you a sample is our trifold um
 
00:08:38.589 --> 00:08:38.599 align:start position:0%
this is combination of
 
00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:43.880 align:start position:0%
OLS and um our office and the graphics
 
00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
and the layout and the design is by uh
 
00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
Deborah Childs with Jennifer tramp's
 
00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:52.760 align:start position:0%
assistance um this will be printed so
 
00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
you work correct represent Dolan this
 
00:08:57.269 --> 00:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
uses a lot of ink and color and it's
 
00:08:59.509 --> 00:08:59.519 align:start position:0%
going to be in a brighter shade of of
 
00:09:02.389 --> 00:09:02.399 align:start position:0%
blue um but we've brought this to this
 
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
meeting so that you can take a look at
 
00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
it and when we meet on the 16th if you
 
00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:08.600 align:start position:0%
could please review this and you have
 
00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:09.430 align:start position:0%
could please review this and you have
any

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:09:12.389 --> 00:09:12.399 align:start position:0%
suggestions um for the next meeting that
 
00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:15.200 align:start position:0%
would be great but as you can see it's
 
00:09:18.829 --> 00:09:18.839 align:start position:0%
to help any member who wants to
 
00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:22.200 align:start position:0%
um wants to propose a study a chaptered
 
00:09:24.509 --> 00:09:24.519 align:start position:0%
study or commission and it says what
 
00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
would it lists out what the purpose
 
00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:28.240 align:start position:0%
should be so the member when you open it
 
00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:31.640 align:start position:0%
up the first panel has what the members
 
00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:32.750 align:start position:0%
up the first panel has what the members
should

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
should
 
00:09:34.829 --> 00:09:34.839 align:start position:0%
consider the purpose would be if they
 
00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:37.800 align:start position:0%
want to create one then in the middle
 
00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
panel it has where to begin to clarify
 
00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:42.959 align:start position:0%
the need to do your research see if
 
00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
something exists as we've mentioned so
 
00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:47.720 align:start position:0%
many times with you before um see if
 
00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
similar Studies have been n in the past
 
00:09:50.829 --> 00:09:50.839 align:start position:0%
and that they can get that done in
 
00:09:53.509 --> 00:09:53.519 align:start position:0%
legislative Services Research and
 
00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
possibly get a legislative history on it
 
00:09:58.030 --> 00:09:58.040 align:start position:0%
all discussed with uh prior study
 
00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
committee or commission chair chairs
 
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
review the policy um with the policy
 
00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:04.600 align:start position:0%
committee chair I mean review the study
 
00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:06.680 align:start position:0%
with the policy committee chair and then
 
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
think about the best method of study so
 
00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:10.640 align:start position:0%
we list some methods of study there to
 
00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:13.000 align:start position:0%
think about do you want to do your own
 
00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
research and not have a commission at
 
00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:17.560 align:start position:0%
all um again check in with the policy
 
00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
committee see see what are your options
 
00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:21.320 align:start position:0%
are and they're all listed out there
 
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
with the methods of study where those
 
00:10:24.829 --> 00:10:24.839 align:start position:0%
green circles are with the White
 
00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
Checks then once that so so the Panet B
 
00:10:34.069 --> 00:10:34.079 align:start position:0%
basically is just a guideline on how to
 
00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:36.440 align:start position:0%
develop the process on how you would
 
00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:39.560 align:start position:0%
think about creating a study so then um
 
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
best method is listed um will'll depend
 
00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:44.160 align:start position:0%
on the subject prior studies and it
 
00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:47.480 align:start position:0%
walks the sponsor through what all the
 
00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
possibilities may
 
00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:52.200 align:start position:0%
be um model legislation to to look at
 
00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
RSA 1449 which is is what drives
 
00:10:57.629 --> 00:10:57.639 align:start position:0%
everything behind the scenes in study
 
00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
commissions and chaptered
 
00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:04.200 align:start position:0%
studies then um as you flip this um back
 
00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:06.120 align:start position:0%
panel you can see that has chaptered
 
00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:08.360 align:start position:0%
studies what are they um and what's the
 
00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
difference between a chapter study and a
 
00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:13.000 align:start position:0%
statutory then as you fold that back
 
00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:16.680 align:start position:0%
over it it walks um the member through
 
00:11:20.069 --> 00:11:20.079 align:start position:0%
the process and and how you um how
 
00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:24.040 align:start position:0%
things are created so this is just we
 
00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
want to make it as simple and easily
 
00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
identifiable as possible but
 
00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:32.720 align:start position:0%
we want the committee to uh look at this
 
00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
and come up with any suggestions again
 
00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:37.000 align:start position:0%
this is all a draft and we can redesign
 
00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
it or um make incorporate changes that
 
00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:42.040 align:start position:0%
you think are important because
 
00:11:44.509 --> 00:11:44.519 align:start position:0%
obviously you're the members who request
 
00:11:47.829 --> 00:11:47.839 align:start position:0%
this study so um and I I don't know if I
 
00:11:49.629 --> 00:11:49.639 align:start position:0%
already said this this when we printed
 
00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:53.320 align:start position:0%
this out it was a darker Navy and um we
 
00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:54.920 align:start position:0%
wanted more of a royal blue so our
 
00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
printer upstairs prints differently than
 
00:11:57.949 --> 00:11:57.959 align:start position:0%
the speaker's
 
00:11:57.959 --> 00:12:12.949 align:start position:0%
the speaker's
printer

00:12:12.949 --> 00:12:12.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:15.269 --> 00:12:15.279 align:start position:0%
well we we we would have them available
 
00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
everywhere so that could be a
 
00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:20.720 align:start position:0%
possibility but also we'd like them um
 
00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
in when we do the training we'll have it
 
00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
already for the continuing ed training
 
00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:27.320 align:start position:0%
we'll have them available for our own
 
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
any orientation we just want them
 
00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
accessible and available everywhere so
 
00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:33.800 align:start position:0%
people could see that but certainly if
 
00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
OS uh wanted to or could they would have
 
00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
them well Dave is right here and he's
 
00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
been an intrical part of working on this
 
00:12:54.189 --> 00:12:54.199 align:start position:0%
and he um they created the initial draft
 
00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
and then we um did more work on it they
 
00:12:59.189 --> 00:12:59.199 align:start position:0%
did a hell of a lot more work on it Dave
 
00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
alonis director of legislative services
 
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
and by the time they come we start
 
00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:06.040 align:start position:0%
drafting it's too late 90% of our
 
00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
traffic is by email not foot traffic so
 
00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
we could have piles there waiting and no
 
00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
one's going to see them I think they
 
00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
should be out there throughout the
 
00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:16.639 align:start position:0%
course of a year would we'll have them
 
00:13:18.389 --> 00:13:18.399 align:start position:0%
on our front desk but I think they
 
00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:21.160 align:start position:0%
should be pretty much everywhere and
 
00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:24.240 align:start position:0%
anywhere uh through the course of the
 
00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
year and we're going to one of the plans
 
00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
is to do an initial email and have
 
00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:31.480 align:start position:0%
attached as an email um and that will be
 
00:13:35.189 --> 00:13:35.199 align:start position:0%
coming from the speaker's office and um
 
00:13:37.189 --> 00:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
what we did find out as we were putting
 
00:13:39.189 --> 00:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
all this together is more than what's
 
00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:41.680 align:start position:0%
the percentage stve like more than 50%
 
00:13:43.829 --> 00:13:43.839 align:start position:0%
of our study commissions are created
 
00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
through um amendments partway through
 
00:13:49.389 --> 00:13:49.399 align:start position:0%
the session so certainly we we'd have
 
00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:53.240 align:start position:0%
these in committees where members could
 
00:13:58.350 --> 00:13:58.360 align:start position:0%
access it's ready cop in theils sure yes
 
00:13:59.870 --> 00:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
every we're do it everywhere you come up
 
00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
with the idea and we'll add to the list
 
00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
we have a variety of places where we
 
00:14:05.189 --> 00:14:05.199 align:start position:0%
want to distribute
 
00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:07.480 align:start position:0%
these thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:08.920 align:start position:0%
very much and thank you for this it's
 
00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:11.000 align:start position:0%
very helpful I think also that every
 
00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:12.240 align:start position:0%
committee should have it with every
 
00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:14.360 align:start position:0%
chairman reminding members who come to
 
00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
testify or even their own members to
 
00:14:18.069 --> 00:14:18.079 align:start position:0%
look at this and understand it and if
 
00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:19.880 align:start position:0%
they have questions to bring them up
 
00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:24.350 align:start position:0%
they have questions to bring them up
thank

00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:27.160 align:start position:0%
you thank you for doing this it looks
 
00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
great um so just where it says um use
 
00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:34.720 align:start position:0%
the LSR study template is that being
 
00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:35.949 align:start position:0%
the LSR study template is that being
developed

00:14:35.949 --> 00:14:35.959 align:start position:0%
developed
 
00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
or so something I've been interested in
 
00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
so what we're doing is a um I'm sorry I
 
00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
I I don't want to do Progressive so I
 
00:14:46.949 --> 00:14:46.959 align:start position:0%
can't doing this but I said losing
 
00:14:51.629 --> 00:14:51.639 align:start position:0%
battle um so we are working on something
 
00:14:53.629 --> 00:14:53.639 align:start position:0%
that we can come up with that might be
 
00:14:56.749 --> 00:14:56.759 align:start position:0%
utilized it won't necessarily be a a
 
00:14:59.749 --> 00:14:59.759 align:start position:0%
template we Dave it's some variations of
 
00:15:01.949 --> 00:15:01.959 align:start position:0%
different offices depending on what you
 
00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:03.880 align:start position:0%
need and we're and that's one of our as
 
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
I mentioned we're having these staff
 
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
meetings so when we have our staff
 
00:15:07.829 --> 00:15:07.839 align:start position:0%
meeting this week we're going to look at
 
00:15:09.749 --> 00:15:09.759 align:start position:0%
that draft and see how applicable it
 
00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:13.720 align:start position:0%
will be for all of this my thought is
 
00:15:15.509 --> 00:15:15.519 align:start position:0%
I'm differentiating when we use word
 
00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:18.160 align:start position:0%
template at OS it's part of the the
 
00:15:22.069 --> 00:15:22.079 align:start position:0%
drafting system and it's it's not
 
00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:24.040 align:start position:0%
something you can print off and and look
 
00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:26.720 align:start position:0%
at because it's a progressive logic in
 
00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
there uh but I was thinking of something
 
00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
something that's more of a worksheet uh
 
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
so something that members can maybe fill
 
00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
in the blanks uh and and then and then
 
00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:41.000 align:start position:0%
bring to us uh as the case may be so
 
00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
that I'm calling it a worksheet and we
 
00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:45.880 align:start position:0%
can work on we should rename it template
 
00:15:47.309 --> 00:15:47.319 align:start position:0%
is not the right word that's just the
 
00:15:49.189 --> 00:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
word we grab worksheet would make more
 
00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:52.160 align:start position:0%
sense and because as you know XM
 
00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
legislator which is our system that we
 
00:15:57.309 --> 00:15:57.319 align:start position:0%
use in all of our offices to have the um
 
00:15:59.389 --> 00:15:59.399 align:start position:0%
bills go through the process from
 
00:16:01.509 --> 00:16:01.519 align:start position:0%
drafting to they end up at the Secretary
 
00:16:04.949 --> 00:16:04.959 align:start position:0%
of States um this all incorporating that
 
00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
we just can't print off that system um
 
00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:11.240 align:start position:0%
but this would be a worksheet that that
 
00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
would help a member or see the design of
 
00:16:15.829 --> 00:16:15.839 align:start position:0%
what we need and we we've developed it
 
00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:18.160 align:start position:0%
we've had five different versions
 
00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
completely different from the others so
 
00:16:23.509 --> 00:16:23.519 align:start position:0%
this most recent one hopefully will help
 
00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:25.240 align:start position:0%
guide us and then we'll have that for
 
00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:27.160 align:start position:0%
your review for committee members as a
 
00:16:30.509 --> 00:16:30.519 align:start position:0%
homework assignment please review this
 
00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
yes please and send me comments to my uh
 
00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:37.880 align:start position:0%
legislative email and I'll consolidate
 
00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
them and provide them to to Ann and
 
00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:43.000 align:start position:0%
David and and Deborah Deborah is really
 
00:16:45.629 --> 00:16:45.639 align:start position:0%
she's she's this this is Deborah she's
 
00:16:48.189 --> 00:16:48.199 align:start position:0%
done a fantastic job on all this for us
 
00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
she's brought it all together she so if
 
00:16:52.629 --> 00:16:52.639 align:start position:0%
you have comments and suggestions for
 
00:16:55.829 --> 00:16:55.839 align:start position:0%

negotiated our our our meeting day so
 
00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
that we uh are trying to make sure we
 
00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:10.480 align:start position:0%
don't step on any of
 
00:17:13.189 --> 00:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
the I think it's actually the 16th that
 
00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:15.640 align:start position:0%
we're meeting sorry the 16 the 16th so
 
00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:17.839 align:start position:0%
that we we don't step on any of the

religious holidays that are upcoming uh
 
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:23.280 align:start position:0%

00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
everybody's schedule so please get them
 
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:27.120 align:start position:0%

00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:43.029 --> 00:17:43.039 align:start position:0%
um sorry yeah date for the next meeting
 
00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
Monday the 16th at 1
 
00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:49.400 align:start position:0%
o' and then the um last item that we had
 
00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
for uh handouts um was uh Brad greenin
 
00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:56.480 align:start position:0%
in our office went through the LSR list
 
00:17:59.789 --> 00:17:59.799 align:start position:0%
and he found it's it's um it's a chart
 
00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:02.200 align:start position:0%
that you have
 
00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:07.000 align:start position:0%
uh it's this chart right and in it um
 
00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
lists the 30 lsrs that are in the titles
 
00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh as of now as of now 15 chapter and 15
 
00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:19.000 align:start position:0%
statuto so you can see the titles of
 
00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:22.360 align:start position:0%
the um statuto which are commissions
 
00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
those are all italicized so you can
 
00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
break them out easily to read them and
 
00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:30.280 align:start position:0%
then the um commissions are chaptered
 
00:18:33.549 --> 00:18:33.559 align:start position:0%
studies are in regular uh print and it
 
00:18:35.789 --> 00:18:35.799 align:start position:0%
just lists you can see the titles um and
 
00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
you can see the drafters excuse me
 
00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:42.520 align:start position:0%
sponsors so you may be able to um
 
00:18:45.789 --> 00:18:45.799 align:start position:0%
inquire uh the reasoning behind wanting
 
00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:50.840 align:start position:0%
to submit those and then um we have the
 
00:18:53.549 --> 00:18:53.559 align:start position:0%
ls Brad also included lsrs repealing a
 
00:18:56.909 --> 00:18:56.919 align:start position:0%
Comm commission we have
 
00:18:59.430 --> 00:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
um told committees repealed one and
 
00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
total commissions repealed three so
 
00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
there's four of those and then we have
 
00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:06.360 align:start position:0%
lsrs amending a committee or commission
 
00:19:08.789 --> 00:19:08.799 align:start position:0%
and that's um total commissions to be
 
00:19:11.029 --> 00:19:11.039 align:start position:0%
amended seven of
 
00:19:14.789 --> 00:19:14.799 align:start position:0%
them so that's to date that was um as of
 
00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:18.200 align:start position:0%
Friday and then this is only house this
 
00:19:20.029 --> 00:19:20.039 align:start position:0%
has not include Senate
 
00:19:23.149 --> 00:19:23.159 align:start position:0%
yet yeah I was mentioning to
 
00:19:26.149 --> 00:19:26.159 align:start position:0%
representative AEL that almost feels
 
00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
like from a committee standpoint we're
 
00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
shoveling sand against the ti as we T it
 
00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:33.880 align:start position:0%
feels like as we tackle these with more
 
00:19:37.789 --> 00:19:37.799 align:start position:0%
coming up it's like talking to the
 
00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:39.880 align:start position:0%
wall it
 
00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:47.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:50.240 align:start position:0%
it so we thought that that would be a
 
00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
helpful list for the committee to see
 
00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:57.080 align:start position:0%
well it certainly does point out the the
 
00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
the problem that uh that we've got and
 
00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
we're working
 
00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:07.280 align:start position:0%
on and not making a lot of progress
 
00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:09.720 align:start position:0%
yet go ahead I'm sorry excuse me I'm
 
00:20:11.669 --> 00:20:11.679 align:start position:0%
sorry and and so those were my only
 
00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
items unless anybody had um any
 
00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:16.600 align:start position:0%
questions we will have more updates for
 
00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:18.520 align:start position:0%
you on the 16th because as I mentioned
 
00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
we are working staff is working um as we
 
00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
can bring everybody together um and and
 
00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
because we we prefer toing as much as a
 
00:20:30.909 --> 00:20:30.919 align:start position:0%
final product to you so you're not
 
00:20:32.789 --> 00:20:32.799 align:start position:0%
wasting your time looking at all of our
 
00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:34.760 align:start position:0%
drafts in the background but we like to
 
00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
update you with the work that we are
 
00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
doing and um it was my understanding
 
00:20:40.909 --> 00:20:40.919 align:start position:0%
that the speaker was going to be here
 
00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
but I think he may have a conflict I'm
 
00:20:45.909 --> 00:20:45.919 align:start position:0%
not yeah I'm not he's a busy guy um POS
 
00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:47.400 align:start position:0%
I did
 
00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
um okay so yes he what he's not um I
 
00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:52.600 align:start position:0%
don't believe he's gonna be able to make
 
00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
it so um that is
 
00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:01.360 align:start position:0%
um that is where we are to date anybody
 
00:21:04.149 --> 00:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
on the committee have comments or
 
00:21:08.669 --> 00:21:08.679 align:start position:0%
questions for for our pres presenters
 
00:21:12.669 --> 00:21:12.679 align:start position:0%
today yes I'm not here able to be here
 
00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:15.640 align:start position:0%
on the 16th and I know that we left this
 
00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
topic but it seems like we're just kind
 
00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
of wrapping everything up here and I
 
00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:23.400 align:start position:0%
just wanted to ask on the LSR uh
 
00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
worksheet which I think is a really good
 
00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
idea you will you be Pro
 
00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:31.000 align:start position:0%
well you'll be thinking about how you'll
 
00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
be disseminating it I was just thinking
 
00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:35.400 align:start position:0%
if you send this out online it would be
 
00:21:38.149 --> 00:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
really neat to just have a hyperlink to
 
00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
the worksheet that somebody could click
 
00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:44.840 align:start position:0%
on and then my only other thought was
 
00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
that the worksheet if it could include
 
00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:51.080 align:start position:0%
the important parts of
 
00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
1449 like sort of giving them they need
 
00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
to have a fiveyear repeal date and you
 
00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:58.710 align:start position:0%
to have a fiveyear repeal date and you
know

00:21:58.710 --> 00:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
we and maybe you have that in mind but I
 
00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:04.400 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make that comment since I
 
00:22:07.149 --> 00:22:07.159 align:start position:0%
won't thank you repr yes we do have that
 
00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:09.440 align:start position:0%
because we have a more this is just a
 
00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
quick overview and we do have a a sheet
 
00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
that goes into more detail exactly what
 
00:22:16.909 --> 00:22:16.919 align:start position:0%
you've mentioned the reminders of these
 
00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:19.240 align:start position:0%
are the other items that are
 
00:22:22.269 --> 00:22:22.279 align:start position:0%
included I think it's and one of the
 
00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:24.320 align:start position:0%
items as well is that to consider when
 
00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:27.400 align:start position:0%
you're requesting a study commission to
 
00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
to know how long it will take to
 
00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:31.400 align:start position:0%
possibly get all the appointments made
 
00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:34.120 align:start position:0%
and that it may be eating up your time
 
00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:37.960 align:start position:0%
as you're trying to um get to the um
 
00:22:39.149 --> 00:22:39.159 align:start position:0%
point of
 
00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
study now we were here on the trifold
 
00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
what I let's say that
 
00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
um I'm in a I'm on a
 
00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
committee um and standing committee and
 
00:22:59.950 --> 00:22:59.960 align:start position:0%
I want to re search and or have the
 
00:23:01.909 --> 00:23:01.919 align:start position:0%
committee look at an issue and I'm
 
00:23:05.909 --> 00:23:05.919 align:start position:0%
getting ready to propose new legislation
 
00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
that would study some
 
00:23:12.149 --> 00:23:12.159 align:start position:0%
issue what where in in the trifold would
 
00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:15.880 align:start position:0%
I get the suggestion or guidance that
 
00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:16.870 align:start position:0%
I get the suggestion or guidance that
but

00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
first ask the committee chair to see if
 
00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:23.400 align:start position:0%
they can take it up as as a study within
 
00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
the committee like you know like a three
 
00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:28.520 align:start position:0%
a three representative person study
 
00:23:32.549 --> 00:23:32.559 align:start position:0%
as opposed to appointing a a so um Mr
 
00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
chair that's where we have where we have
 
00:23:37.149 --> 00:23:37.159 align:start position:0%
under where to begin and we have review
 
00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:40.400 align:start position:0%
with policy chair that is um item number
 
00:23:43.029 --> 00:23:43.039 align:start position:0%
four right that would be where that is
 
00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:44.200 align:start position:0%
because we're also going to be working
 
00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:46.640 align:start position:0%
with the chairs to make them aware of
 
00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
all this um and so that's why we
 
00:23:50.669 --> 00:23:50.679 align:start position:0%
suggested that there and again because
 
00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:53.320 align:start position:0%
this has this was an abbreviated version
 
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
and the one that will go into more
 
00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
detail as you suggested representative
 
00:23:59.230 --> 00:23:59.240 align:start position:0%
evil that will have the specific
 
00:24:02.029 --> 00:24:02.039 align:start position:0%
explanation in there that can can this
 
00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:05.880 align:start position:0%
be solved by a um subcommittee of a
 
00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:08.240 align:start position:0%
policy committee could a standing
 
00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:11.080 align:start position:0%
committee can this issue be reviewed in
 
00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:14.600 align:start position:0%
that manner so uh question for you David
 
00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
let's say that uh someone comes forth
 
00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
with an LSR that wants to like one of
 
00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
these here U establishing a
 
00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
committee uh
 
00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:33.240 align:start position:0%
and let's say that the chair Su
 
00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
intercedes uh and talks to the member
 
00:24:39.149 --> 00:24:39.159 align:start position:0%
and says let's do this instead instead
 
00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:42.760 align:start position:0%
of creating a committee let's study it
 
00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:43.960 align:start position:0%
within the
 
00:24:47.789 --> 00:24:47.799 align:start position:0%
committee um if that intervention is
 
00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
successful well I guess I'm I'm
 
00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
proposing how it work would work if that
 
00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
intervention is successful how how do we
 
00:24:58.269 --> 00:24:58.279 align:start position:0%
what's the mechanics of pulling back the
 
00:25:02.669 --> 00:25:02.679 align:start position:0%
LSR and and any sponsor can ask for the
 
00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:07.000 align:start position:0%
bill to the LSR to be withdrawn up until
 
00:25:09.669 --> 00:25:09.679 align:start position:0%
introduction so assuming that's going to
 
00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:12.120 align:start position:0%
be the first week in January that's the
 
00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:13.880 align:start position:0%
that would be the date so when it gets
 
00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
numbered and put out there that that
 
00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
then it becomes property of the house
 
00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:21.480 align:start position:0%
and not of the sponsor okay so so let's
 
00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:24.440 align:start position:0%
say that that the sponsor agrees to
 
00:25:28.269 --> 00:25:28.279 align:start position:0%
withdraw in lie of this other activity
 
00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:31.960 align:start position:0%
are all the co-sponsors also notified or
 
00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
how how do we what's the the process
 
00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
being completed in order to do
 
00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:41.200 align:start position:0%
that co-sponsors can take on a bill if
 
00:25:44.269 --> 00:25:44.279 align:start position:0%
if the sponsor uh chooses not to but I
 
00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:46.480 align:start position:0%
have not seen that to be the case if the
 
00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:49.960 align:start position:0%
sponsor wants to withdraw that it simply
 
00:25:53.710 --> 00:25:53.720 align:start position:0%
gets withdrawn okay okay anyone have any
 
00:25:57.789 --> 00:25:57.799 align:start position:0%
comments about that process and that can
 
00:25:59.750 --> 00:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
happen after this this Prime sponsor
 
00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
signs off or after be done for the
 
00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
January deadline yes when by the way
 
00:26:06.909 --> 00:26:06.919 align:start position:0%
when in January is that is that the
 
00:26:08.909 --> 00:26:08.919 align:start position:0%
first week in January
 
00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
um I'm not I'm not sure about that that
 
00:26:14.029 --> 00:26:14.039 align:start position:0%
date but it's right in early
 
00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:16.760 align:start position:0%
January could you help us find out what
 
00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
that date is I think it's the first
 
00:26:20.029 --> 00:26:20.039 align:start position:0%
Wednesday first day of
 
00:26:25.389 --> 00:26:25.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:38.269 --> 00:26:38.279 align:start position:0%
okay anyone else have any questions for
 
00:26:41.669 --> 00:26:41.679 align:start position:0%
our distinguished guest speakers yes one
 
00:26:44.789 --> 00:26:44.799 align:start position:0%
more yeah um I know that we've s we've
 
00:26:46.789 --> 00:26:46.799 align:start position:0%
been really encouraging people to check
 
00:26:49.789 --> 00:26:49.799 align:start position:0%
with OS and do research in advance of a
 
00:26:52.029 --> 00:26:52.039 align:start position:0%
decision I'm I I was curious whether
 
00:26:56.549 --> 00:26:56.559 align:start position:0%
you'd seen an uptick in um research
 
00:26:58.389 --> 00:26:58.399 align:start position:0%
inquiries and
 
00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely you had absolutely uh those
 
00:27:04.669 --> 00:27:04.679 align:start position:0%
four folks have been slammed uh this
 
00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:07.480 align:start position:0%
fall unfortunately a lot of it was in
 
00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
the last day or two of of uh LSR
 
00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
submission so some pretty large requests
 
00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:16.520 align:start position:0%
for research came in with one day left
 
00:27:18.149 --> 00:27:18.159 align:start position:0%
before you could file so there's not
 
00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:20.360 align:start position:0%
enough lot how many how many lsrs have
 
00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:24.440 align:start position:0%
there been there's roughly 800 uh house
 
00:27:27.269 --> 00:27:27.279 align:start position:0%
lsrs and uh a number of them have been
 
00:27:27.279 --> 00:27:29.110 align:start position:0%
lsrs and uh a number of them have been
uh

00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
withdrawn as duplicates because in some
 
00:27:33.870 --> 00:27:33.880 align:start position:0%
cases we're only now realizing what is a
 
00:27:35.909 --> 00:27:35.919 align:start position:0%
duplicate things could come in from two
 
00:27:37.149 --> 00:27:37.159 align:start position:0%
different members end up with two
 
00:27:39.269 --> 00:27:39.279 align:start position:0%
different working titles but then you
 
00:27:40.909 --> 00:27:40.919 align:start position:0%
come to find out they're pretty much
 
00:27:42.909 --> 00:27:42.919 align:start position:0%
exactly the same when you start opening
 
00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
up the do do we do anything with u
 
00:27:48.149 --> 00:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
screening for duplicates that come from
 
00:27:49.549 --> 00:27:49.559 align:start position:0%
the Senate as
 
00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:52.440 align:start position:0%
well the Senate has no rules to that so
 
00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
they uh they can they can bring anything
 
00:27:58.029 --> 00:27:58.039 align:start position:0%
forward as many times as they want
 
00:28:00.269 --> 00:28:00.279 align:start position:0%
do they come through your office yes
 
00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
yeah same process all Senate lsrs are
 
00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:05.880 align:start position:0%
and their filing period is ongoing right
 
00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:09.200 align:start position:0%
now and uh they come in usually it's
 
00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:11.480 align:start position:0%
their AIDs that bring in the uh the
 
00:28:14.269 --> 00:28:14.279 align:start position:0%
request uh and and we put it forward the
 
00:28:16.149 --> 00:28:16.159 align:start position:0%
only difference between the house system
 
00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:19.000 align:start position:0%
and Senate system is that the the Senate
 
00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
allows for confidential lsrs so when you
 
00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
when you see the list and the first list
 
00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
that will have some that'll have Senate
 
00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:28.360 align:start position:0%
lsrs will be put on the public site
 
00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
later today hopefully uh and that'll be
 
00:28:33.509 --> 00:28:33.519 align:start position:0%
a list of somewhere between 40 and 50
 
00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
there's I think a couple of uh house
 
00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
lsrs that were kind of sitting around
 
00:28:41.509 --> 00:28:41.519 align:start position:0%
that will be included but uh if you look
 
00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:43.320 align:start position:0%
at the numbering there's always going to
 
00:28:45.029 --> 00:28:45.039 align:start position:0%
be gaps in the numbering now once we get
 
00:28:47.389 --> 00:28:47.399 align:start position:0%
to the Senate and those are lsrs that
 
00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:49.880 align:start position:0%
are confidential requ requested by the
 
00:28:52.789 --> 00:28:52.799 align:start position:0%
senator and in that case they do not
 
00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:58.549 --> 00:28:58.559 align:start position:0%
introduction okay thank you yes well I
 
00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
was just going to follow up and just say
 
00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:02.120 align:start position:0%
I'm glad to hear that they're you know
 
00:29:04.909 --> 00:29:04.919 align:start position:0%
be careful what you ask for right but um
 
00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
I mean I like to think that the use of
 
00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:11.480 align:start position:0%
the research folks affected the number
 
00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:14.360 align:start position:0%
and the quality of the lsrs that were
 
00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
submitted so we'll see I mean 30 is a
 
00:29:20.509 --> 00:29:20.519 align:start position:0%
lot but I've seen many more study
 
00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:22.640 align:start position:0%
committee bills filed I mean I don't
 
00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
know how many there are on average
 
00:29:28.669 --> 00:29:28.679 align:start position:0%
but hopefully we dampen TI yeah I think
 
00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
I think the yes Matt go ahead well I
 
00:29:33.029 --> 00:29:33.039 align:start position:0%
just gonna say I I think there's that
 
00:29:35.909 --> 00:29:35.919 align:start position:0%
opportunity you know for the speaker and
 
00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:38.840 align:start position:0%
you you know with chairs to
 
00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
encourage uh you know the establishment
 
00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
of some subcommittees you know so that
 
00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:45.480 align:start position:0%
we don't actually need to see some of
 
00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:47.240 align:start position:0%
these study committee and study
 
00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:49.960 align:start position:0%
commission uh bills become lot that
 
00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:51.720 align:start position:0%
there there is an Avenue to do this
 
00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
outside of legislation so even though
 
00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:56.720 align:start position:0%
it's at 30 right now it could be some of
 
00:29:58.470 --> 00:29:58.480 align:start position:0%
them are probably not you know wouldn't
 
00:30:01.269 --> 00:30:01.279 align:start position:0%
pass anyways but um you know if there's
 
00:30:04.350 --> 00:30:04.360 align:start position:0%
a bipartisan interest in pursuing a
 
00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
specific topic um you know it could be
 
00:30:10.149 --> 00:30:10.159 align:start position:0%
easy enough to to pursue it uh you know
 
00:30:12.389 --> 00:30:12.399 align:start position:0%
through the committee process yeah the
 
00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
let me say that the the research folks
 
00:30:17.549 --> 00:30:17.559 align:start position:0%
are a big help I I can speak from
 
00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:21.640 align:start position:0%
personal experience this this session uh
 
00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
that I was getting ready to put in uh an
 
00:30:28.509 --> 00:30:28.519 align:start position:0%
LSR on an issue around boting
 
00:30:31.669 --> 00:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
the details aren't important but u i I
 
00:30:33.669 --> 00:30:33.679 align:start position:0%
had found through some minimal research
 
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
that I had done and some encouragement
 
00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:37.640 align:start position:0%
from the research folks that that the
 
00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:40.480 align:start position:0%
issue had already been tackled in in a
 
00:30:43.509 --> 00:30:43.519 align:start position:0%
bill that was put forth by the Senate a
 
00:30:45.509 --> 00:30:45.519 align:start position:0%
couple of years ago and I really needed
 
00:30:49.669 --> 00:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
to research what was done slash not done
 
00:30:52.549 --> 00:30:52.559 align:start position:0%
with that bill before I put in another
 
00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
dup so-called duplicate Bill along very
 
00:30:59.590 --> 00:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
similar lines so I I withdrew my my
 
00:31:02.029 --> 00:31:02.039 align:start position:0%
effort uh to do that research probably
 
00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:05.240 align:start position:0%
and maybe will file next year but uh
 
00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:10.440 align:start position:0%
their their help is invaluable in fact U
 
00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:13.480 align:start position:0%
I have found them uh being being able to
 
00:31:16.549 --> 00:31:16.559 align:start position:0%
research across the entire country as to
 
00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:19.320 align:start position:0%
what other legislators are doing in
 
00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:23.200 align:start position:0%
other states along similar subject lines
 
00:31:25.149 --> 00:31:25.159 align:start position:0%
it's been very helpful and they and they
 
00:31:27.509 --> 00:31:27.519 align:start position:0%
do that every every day and it's there's
 
00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
always something different going through
 
00:31:31.789 --> 00:31:31.799 align:start position:0%
that office every day because there's a
 
00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
lot of different topics that they that
 
00:31:35.549 --> 00:31:35.559 align:start position:0%
they look into we were just talking
 
00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:38.440 align:start position:0%
about uh one of the the 50 state surveys
 
00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:40.760 align:start position:0%
that that my and crew were doing this
 
00:31:42.509 --> 00:31:42.519 align:start position:0%

00:31:45.389 --> 00:31:45.399 align:start position:0%
legislation great so please uh take back

00:32:17.710 --> 00:32:17.720 align:start position:0%
this trifold not just the colors but the
 
00:32:20.909 --> 00:32:20.919 align:start position:0%
the content and uh and get those
 
00:32:23.789 --> 00:32:23.799 align:start position:0%
comments to me and for some reason if I
 
00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
drop dead get them right to an directly
 
00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:28.990 align:start position:0%
drop dead get them right to an directly
um

00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:29.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:32.240 align:start position:0%
you never know you never
 
00:32:36.149 --> 00:32:36.159 align:start position:0%
know you never know uh and uh we'll
 
00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:38.840 align:start position:0%
we'll review that those comments on the
 
00:32:42.029 --> 00:32:42.039 align:start position:0%
14th and uh if we need to we'll we'll
 
00:32:45.029 --> 00:32:45.039 align:start position:0%
tag the the vice chair to step up in
 
00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:46.760 align:start position:0%
case of my
 
00:32:51.789 --> 00:32:51.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:56.029 --> 00:32:56.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:58.950 --> 00:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
us and uh and we're not going to forget
 
00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
we get already some comments about
 
00:33:04.509 --> 00:33:04.519 align:start position:0%
having a hyperlink and also the
 
00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:07.720 align:start position:0%
1449 uh limitations so we've got that
 
00:33:08.789 --> 00:33:08.799 align:start position:0%
already as
 
00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:11.200 align:start position:0%
feedback uh so that's
 
00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:13.480 align:start position:0%
important um so I just want to let you
 
00:33:14.669 --> 00:33:14.679 align:start position:0%
know that
 
00:33:16.629 --> 00:33:16.639 align:start position:0%
that my
 
00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:19.240 align:start position:0%
intent uh and I I don't have any push
 
00:33:21.509 --> 00:33:21.519 align:start position:0%
back from you all on this yet but my
 
00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
intent was to uh tap the individual
 
00:33:29.470 --> 00:33:29.480 align:start position:0%
house chair on the on the shoulder and
 
00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
invite them to these to one of these
 
00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:34.440 align:start position:0%
meetings upcoming meetings along with
 
00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
their Vice chair and their uh ranking
 
00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
member to M suggestion uh so that we we
 
00:33:43.669 --> 00:33:43.679 align:start position:0%
make sure that that we're fair about
 
00:33:45.909 --> 00:33:45.919 align:start position:0%
this and ask them to come to this
 
00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
meeting and talk about uh what is on
 
00:33:55.149 --> 00:33:55.159 align:start position:0%
their table as far as uh uh committees
 
00:33:57.710 --> 00:33:57.720 align:start position:0%
and commissions that they have cogn over
 
00:34:00.149 --> 00:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
or should have cognizance over and then
 
00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:03.880 align:start position:0%
what will be their suggestion to reduce
 
00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:06.720 align:start position:0%
the their uh utilizing the various
 
00:34:09.990 --> 00:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
strategies in our in our trifold or in
 
00:34:11.629 --> 00:34:11.639 align:start position:0%
just in discussion what would be the
 
00:34:15.109 --> 00:34:15.119 align:start position:0%
various strategies to reduce that number
 
00:34:16.589 --> 00:34:16.599 align:start position:0%
uh could be
 
00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
consolidating uh taking taking it up
 
00:34:21.310 --> 00:34:21.320 align:start position:0%
within their their committee as opposed
 
00:34:24.349 --> 00:34:24.359 align:start position:0%
to putting it out as a as new
 
00:34:29.629 --> 00:34:29.639 align:start position:0%
legislation Etc uh and ultimately if if
 
00:34:32.349 --> 00:34:32.359 align:start position:0%
we have a couple dozen committees in the
 
00:34:36.869 --> 00:34:36.879 align:start position:0%
house and if we can get I'm I'm just
 
00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
shooting in the dark here if we can get
 
00:34:40.149 --> 00:34:40.159 align:start position:0%
them to all
 
00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
agree kill one of their committees
 
00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:47.399 align:start position:0%
that's 24 committees that we can we can
 
00:34:50.589 --> 00:34:50.599 align:start position:0%
uh tackle and hopefully it's more than
 
00:34:54.349 --> 00:34:54.359 align:start position:0%
one maybe it's two or three uh but you
 
00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
know if we can get so I've already
 
00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:00.640 align:start position:0%
spoken with with the technology uh
 
00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:03.200 align:start position:0%
committee uh that the uh I spoke with
 
00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:06.280 align:start position:0%
the the vice chair he's going to round
 
00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
up uh his folks and I've uh at least
 
00:35:11.829 --> 00:35:11.839 align:start position:0%
made an attempt to talk to Health and
 
00:35:15.829 --> 00:35:15.839 align:start position:0%
Human Services uh Wayne McDonald is the
 
00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:19.560 align:start position:0%
chair and so you know I'm gonna try to
 
00:35:21.550 --> 00:35:21.560 align:start position:0%
pick them off you know one or two at a
 
00:35:23.470 --> 00:35:23.480 align:start position:0%
time and get them invited to get them on
 
00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:27.160 align:start position:0%
our agenda get them sitting here and
 
00:35:30.030 --> 00:35:30.040 align:start position:0%
open up a discussion about about the
 
00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:32.280 align:start position:0%
strategy to
 
00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:34.030 align:start position:0%
strategy to
reduce

00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:34.040 align:start position:0%
reduce
 
00:35:37.829 --> 00:35:37.839 align:start position:0%
uh their activity in this Arena and
 
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
maybe some specific suggestions to them
 
00:35:45.790 --> 00:35:45.800 align:start position:0%
and from them uh for uh for
 
00:35:48.790 --> 00:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
reduction uh that's on their plate in
 
00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
front of
 
00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:53.000 align:start position:0%
them hopefully that will be successful
 
00:35:56.829 --> 00:35:56.839 align:start position:0%
we'll see make a few a few attempts at
 
00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:00.520 align:start position:0%
at it and staff is welcome to to come
 
00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
we'll let you know ahead of time who
 
00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:05.560 align:start position:0%
we're going to be interviewing and and
 
00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
and suggestion I I'm under the belief
 
00:36:10.990 --> 00:36:11.000 align:start position:0%
that that we're going to talk to chairs
 
00:36:15.550 --> 00:36:15.560 align:start position:0%
and vice chairs and I I really think
 
00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
that in many cases they're not even
 
00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
going to know what's on their
 
00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:23.800 align:start position:0%
plate uh and they're going to say you
 
00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:25.960 align:start position:0%
know we're going to say from our
 
00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
Viewpoint you
 
00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
have 20 committees that you should be uh
 
00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:33.200 align:start position:0%
overseeing and they're and they're going
 
00:36:35.349 --> 00:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
to have puzzled looks on their face and
 
00:36:37.829 --> 00:36:37.839 align:start position:0%
I'm only aware of two or three and we're
 
00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
going to have to help educate them and
 
00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:42.560 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to help uh get
 
00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
back to us to say okay now I recognize
 
00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
what I've got and here's what my
 
00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
strategy is going to be or here I'm
 
00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:50.720 align:start position:0%
going to go off and think about it and
 
00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
work with uh with my committee my uh in
 
00:36:57.829 --> 00:36:57.839 align:start position:0%
the leadership of my committee both
 
00:37:01.390 --> 00:37:01.400 align:start position:0%
both uh both sides of the aisle this
 
00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
this this should not be a we're going to
 
00:37:06.309 --> 00:37:06.319 align:start position:0%
do this even though you don't want to do
 
00:37:07.630 --> 00:37:07.640 align:start position:0%
it I think I think we ought to be
 
00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
looking for those opportunities that we
 
00:37:12.829 --> 00:37:12.839 align:start position:0%
all can agree on are good opportunities
 
00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
not we're not I don't think we're need
 
00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:16.880 align:start position:0%
to especially at this early point in the
 
00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
process I don't think we need to force
 
00:37:20.069 --> 00:37:20.079 align:start position:0%
anything down anybody's throat I think
 
00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:23.240 align:start position:0%
there's enough opportunities out there
 
00:37:25.109 --> 00:37:25.119 align:start position:0%
that we can uh we
 
00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:28.720 align:start position:0%
can agree be agreeable
 
00:37:31.309 --> 00:37:31.319 align:start position:0%
and and moving on on many of these
 
00:37:33.829 --> 00:37:33.839 align:start position:0%
things any any thoughts on that yeah
 
00:37:36.430 --> 00:37:36.440 align:start position:0%
John I I have a question basic it's for
 
00:37:40.829 --> 00:37:40.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:44.069 --> 00:37:44.079 align:start position:0%
an my my question in on the master list
 
00:37:50.589 --> 00:37:50.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:53.069 --> 00:37:53.079 align:start position:0%
completion because you know when when we
 
00:37:56.069 --> 00:37:56.079 align:start position:0%
have all these chairs come before us we
 
00:37:58.030 --> 00:37:58.040 align:start position:0%
better have a master list of what
 
00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
they're responsible for because you know
 
00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:02.280 align:start position:0%
they probably don't it's probably going
 
00:38:03.790 --> 00:38:03.800 align:start position:0%
to be a while because we're working with
 
00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:06.680 align:start position:0%
the it to finalize it all but if you
 
00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:09.440 align:start position:0%
recall that list that we gave you two
 
00:38:12.270 --> 00:38:12.280 align:start position:0%
weeks ago before that of the 12 items it
 
00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:14.200 align:start position:0%
worked off of Representative eil list
 
00:38:17.950 --> 00:38:17.960 align:start position:0%
from when we had that last um extensive
 
00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
very extensive two-year overview and
 
00:38:23.950 --> 00:38:23.960 align:start position:0%
that report is in your binder so as I
 
00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
asked representative Dolan earlier was
 
00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
that the plan to to start another study
 
00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:30.720 align:start position:0%
in that manner but a different vehicle
 
00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:33.640 align:start position:0%
and that you go the chairs first so this
 
00:38:36.829 --> 00:38:36.839 align:start position:0%
would be a different um development so
 
00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:38.680 align:start position:0%
what we so what this master list is
 
00:38:40.589 --> 00:38:40.599 align:start position:0%
right now would basically as I know the
 
00:38:43.589 --> 00:38:43.599 align:start position:0%
bill number the bill and and a whole
 
00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
bunch of different
 
00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:48.160 align:start position:0%
categories and um it will be broken down
 
00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:50.640 align:start position:0%
by we can we're we're working with it
 
00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
see how we can manipulate it to be
 
00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:54.680 align:start position:0%
once's just for health but as we've told
 
00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
you before there may be one that you
 
00:38:58.069 --> 00:38:58.079 align:start position:0%
will think is Health but actually may be
 
00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
overseen by Science and Tech because of
 
00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
some of the nature it might be overseen
 
00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:03.440 align:start position:0%
by children of family and so that's
 
00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
where it's going to take a while to
 
00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
figure out where those little ones are
 
00:39:11.109 --> 00:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
um and we're and that is part of this
 
00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
overall um program this program is being
 
00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:17.000 align:start position:0%
designed for the entire legislature to
 
00:39:21.470 --> 00:39:21.480 align:start position:0%
be able to uh look at so so it will be
 
00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:24.640 align:start position:0%
available to all staff because every
 
00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:25.720 align:start position:0%
office has something a little bit
 
00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
different that they're looking for in
 
00:39:29.790 --> 00:39:29.800 align:start position:0%
this system so we'd be better able to
 
00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:31.480 align:start position:0%
answer that question of what what the
 
00:39:33.309 --> 00:39:33.319 align:start position:0%
time frame is probably at the 16th when
 
00:39:36.589 --> 00:39:36.599 align:start position:0%
we're going to um talk about that and we
 
00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
so John just so so you know my my
 
00:39:40.829 --> 00:39:40.839 align:start position:0%
thought is baby
 
00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
steps uh so if I if I if we identify
 
00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:46.680 align:start position:0%
like we talk about science and
 
00:39:49.790 --> 00:39:49.800 align:start position:0%
technology and HHS for example if we go
 
00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
to legislative services and say I want
 
00:39:54.109 --> 00:39:54.119 align:start position:0%
to start with those two
 
00:39:57.390 --> 00:39:57.400 align:start position:0%
committees that perhaps legislative
 
00:39:59.630 --> 00:39:59.640 align:start position:0%
Services rather than looking at all the
 
00:40:03.589 --> 00:40:03.599 align:start position:0%
Committees and what all the uh the
 
00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
different commissions and committees
 
00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
that flow into them if we just take one
 
00:40:12.109 --> 00:40:12.119 align:start position:0%
or two at a time then maybe legislative
 
00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:14.240 align:start position:0%
Services can help us peek into the files
 
00:40:18.430 --> 00:40:18.440 align:start position:0%
and say okay on HHS there they have
 
00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
these 20 committees to look at rather
 
00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:25.240 align:start position:0%
than what are the 400 committees that
 
00:40:27.829 --> 00:40:27.839 align:start position:0%
that tear into the you know I don't want
 
00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
to overload you guys or ask you for
 
00:40:31.950 --> 00:40:31.960 align:start position:0%
something that you're not ready to I
 
00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
what I do know about from when this
 
00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:36.200 align:start position:0%
process was done before um
 
00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:38.680 align:start position:0%
representative eil it was two-year
 
00:40:41.069 --> 00:40:41.079 align:start position:0%
process correct and it takes a lot and
 
00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
so we did have um at that point one
 
00:40:46.430 --> 00:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
staff person devoted to it so and we
 
00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
have done this uh four or five times in
 
00:40:53.390 --> 00:40:53.400 align:start position:0%
the last 15 years so I think that's what
 
00:40:55.870 --> 00:40:55.880 align:start position:0%
maybe we'd go back and reexamine how we
 
00:40:57.990 --> 00:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
did all that that and we can come up
 
00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
with better idea on how to start the
 
00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
search I mean we can talk about this
 
00:41:07.870 --> 00:41:07.880 align:start position:0%
some more but I would say when we did it
 
00:41:12.069 --> 00:41:12.079 align:start position:0%
the approach that we took was that we we
 
00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
identified the agencies who were
 
00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
responsible and worked with the various
 
00:41:20.190 --> 00:41:20.200 align:start position:0%
commissions so that they could come in
 
00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
and talk about the activities of the
 
00:41:24.589 --> 00:41:24.599 align:start position:0%
commission sometimes the chairs of those
 
00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
commissions would come in
 
00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:32.200 align:start position:0%
um I think it's really a good idea to um
 
00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:35.160 align:start position:0%
to educate existing chairs of committees
 
00:41:37.710 --> 00:41:37.720 align:start position:0%
on the commissions that relate to their
 
00:41:42.109 --> 00:41:42.119 align:start position:0%
subject matter but I honestly don't
 
00:41:45.950 --> 00:41:45.960 align:start position:0%
think that the chairs of those standing
 
00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:48.520 align:start position:0%
committees are going to know very much
 
00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
about all of these committees how much
 
00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
they meet what their subject matter is
 
00:41:56.309 --> 00:41:56.319 align:start position:0%
and if we expect them to just identify
 
00:42:00.069 --> 00:42:00.079 align:start position:0%
by a couple um I
 
00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
mean in some cases they may be stabbing
 
00:42:05.589 --> 00:42:05.599 align:start position:0%
in the dark I mean we did a really
 
00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
comprehensive long-term process and it
 
00:42:11.589 --> 00:42:11.599 align:start position:0%
was only two years ago so I mean I guess
 
00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
the master list you'll show how many are
 
00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:15.960 align:start position:0%
still active and how many are still
 
00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:17.589 align:start position:0%
still active and how many are still
doing

00:42:17.589 --> 00:42:17.599 align:start position:0%
doing
 
00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
reports um I mean the
 
00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
other I guess the other question here is
 
00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
when we when we did our work we didn't
 
00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
presume to have the substantive
 
00:42:31.150 --> 00:42:31.160 align:start position:0%
knowledge of any of these commissions
 
00:42:33.549 --> 00:42:33.559 align:start position:0%
and committees when they came in and
 
00:42:35.309 --> 00:42:35.319 align:start position:0%
they said look we're doing good work
 
00:42:37.470 --> 00:42:37.480 align:start position:0%
we're producing reports the way we're
 
00:42:39.870 --> 00:42:39.880 align:start position:0%
supposed to be we looked at it
 
00:42:42.190 --> 00:42:42.200 align:start position:0%
objectively and we said yeah you you
 
00:42:44.190 --> 00:42:44.200 align:start position:0%
guys really are doing the work that
 
00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:46.720 align:start position:0%
you're supposed to do and a lot of them
 
00:42:48.309 --> 00:42:48.319 align:start position:0%
do I mean just because they're a
 
00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
commission it doesn't mean they're not
 
00:42:54.790 --> 00:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
doing useful work um so I just I just
 
00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
say all of that because I think it's
 
00:42:59.870 --> 00:42:59.880 align:start position:0%
it's it's going to be challenging for uh
 
00:43:02.670 --> 00:43:02.680 align:start position:0%
standing committee chairs to really have
 
00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:04.640 align:start position:0%
the full amount of knowledge that they
 
00:43:06.910 --> 00:43:06.920 align:start position:0%
would need to have to even have a
 
00:43:10.309 --> 00:43:10.319 align:start position:0%
opinion on this no I agree I like I said
 
00:43:12.589 --> 00:43:12.599 align:start position:0%
I think we're going to have committee
 
00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
chairs come back to us with a big shrug
 
00:43:17.870 --> 00:43:17.880 align:start position:0%
on the shrug on the shoulders and say
 
00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
they don't know but I but I think that's
 
00:43:22.349 --> 00:43:22.359 align:start position:0%
one of the obstacles we need to
 
00:43:26.230 --> 00:43:26.240 align:start position:0%
overcome as far as information to them
 
00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
is make sure that they
 
00:43:33.150 --> 00:43:33.160 align:start position:0%
understand what their umbrella covers so
 
00:43:35.829 --> 00:43:35.839 align:start position:0%
that they can start having more
 
00:43:39.829 --> 00:43:39.839 align:start position:0%
influence on on what happens with those
 
00:43:43.230 --> 00:43:43.240 align:start position:0%
committees that that that because
 
00:43:46.030 --> 00:43:46.040 align:start position:0%
because I know that in in some
 
00:43:49.150 --> 00:43:49.160 align:start position:0%
cases committees and commissions are are
 
00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:50.349 align:start position:0%
cases committees and commissions are are
sometimes

00:43:50.349 --> 00:43:50.359 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
00:43:52.990 --> 00:43:53.000 align:start position:0%
established because there are promises
 
00:43:57.349 --> 00:43:57.359 align:start position:0%
made to constituents about uh
 
00:43:59.829 --> 00:43:59.839 align:start position:0%
looking into a subject matter or
 
00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:02.640 align:start position:0%
whatever and and no and not very many
 
00:44:06.109 --> 00:44:06.119 align:start position:0%
people have a have a an interest in it
 
00:44:09.589 --> 00:44:09.599 align:start position:0%
and it just gets it just gets uh listed
 
00:44:12.549 --> 00:44:12.559 align:start position:0%
and it nothing not a lot happens to it
 
00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
uh you don't get quorums people don't
 
00:44:18.589 --> 00:44:18.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:22.549 --> 00:44:22.559 align:start position:0%
languishes yes uh Mr chair what well one
 
00:44:24.309 --> 00:44:24.319 align:start position:0%
of the things you've just mentioned that
 
00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:26.240 align:start position:0%
was part again part of the the
 
00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
initiatives of all these previous
 
00:44:32.069 --> 00:44:32.079 align:start position:0%
substantial um studies in the in the um
 
00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
as as represent yel mentioned they
 
00:44:35.069 --> 00:44:35.079 align:start position:0%
brought in those people testify and
 
00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
there a good number of commissions that
 
00:44:40.109 --> 00:44:40.119 align:start position:0%
exist we may only have one or two
 
00:44:43.549 --> 00:44:43.559 align:start position:0%
legislators on there but they do that
 
00:44:45.589 --> 00:44:45.599 align:start position:0%
they're involved with requirements they
 
00:44:47.589 --> 00:44:47.599 align:start position:0%
need to exist because the Department of
 
00:44:49.470 --> 00:44:49.480 align:start position:0%
Education needs it to meet a federal
 
00:44:53.349 --> 00:44:53.359 align:start position:0%
requirement and that was all found out
 
00:44:55.309 --> 00:44:55.319 align:start position:0%
two years ago and then four years before
 
00:44:56.990 --> 00:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
that and then six years before that then
 
00:44:58.829 --> 00:44:58.839 align:start position:0%
eight or whatever the breakdown is so
 
00:45:00.670 --> 00:45:00.680 align:start position:0%
that's why in your binders if you look
 
00:45:02.589 --> 00:45:02.599 align:start position:0%
in your binders all those reports are in
 
00:45:05.549 --> 00:45:05.559 align:start position:0%
there and the initiatives are all listed
 
00:45:08.069 --> 00:45:08.079 align:start position:0%
so we gave you the full reports but we
 
00:45:10.030 --> 00:45:10.040 align:start position:0%
can go in there and pull that out or we
 
00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
can possibly redesign some of this
 
00:45:17.589 --> 00:45:17.599 align:start position:0%
information because I again um as we've
 
00:45:18.990 --> 00:45:19.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned when you have the policy
 
00:45:21.309 --> 00:45:21.319 align:start position:0%
chairs to come in and discuss that they
 
00:45:23.950 --> 00:45:23.960 align:start position:0%
may not necessarily know uh a
 
00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
legislative a create a
 
00:45:28.030 --> 00:45:28.040 align:start position:0%
commission that was created by the
 
00:45:31.069 --> 00:45:31.079 align:start position:0%
legislature for HHS for some reason that
 
00:45:34.870 --> 00:45:34.880 align:start position:0%
where it it's it exists for the agency
 
00:45:38.190 --> 00:45:38.200 align:start position:0%
not necessarily for us but this would be
 
00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
another exercise in trying to find all
 
00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:41.800 align:start position:0%
that out I don't know how much of the
 
00:45:43.790 --> 00:45:43.800 align:start position:0%
information has been how much has
 
00:45:46.309 --> 00:45:46.319 align:start position:0%
changed in 24 months so I think that's
 
00:45:49.390 --> 00:45:49.400 align:start position:0%
how you you might want to think think
 
00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:52.720 align:start position:0%
about that um do you do you build upon
 
00:45:54.109 --> 00:45:54.119 align:start position:0%
the information we've already collected
 
00:45:55.950 --> 00:45:55.960 align:start position:0%
even though it's only a couple years old
 
00:45:58.910 --> 00:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
or do you want to um look at it from a
 
00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
different angle right I understand I
 
00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
think the where I'm go going with this
 
00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:06.160 align:start position:0%
is is
 
00:46:09.430 --> 00:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
ownership I'm afraid that that many of
 
00:46:12.109 --> 00:46:12.119 align:start position:0%
these committees or commissions have
 
00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
lack of ownership within the legislature
 
00:46:17.230 --> 00:46:17.240 align:start position:0%
and they they just kind of on their own
 
00:46:21.309 --> 00:46:21.319 align:start position:0%
or the bureaucracy of the of the state
 
00:46:23.950 --> 00:46:23.960 align:start position:0%
is is driving the the continuation of
 
00:46:26.510 --> 00:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
the activity and I I think if we look at
 
00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:29.640 align:start position:0%
the cost of government and what we're
 
00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:31.960 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
00:46:34.190 --> 00:46:34.200 align:start position:0%
accomplish for for the people in the
 
00:46:37.270 --> 00:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
state I think that there are some some
 
00:46:40.069 --> 00:46:40.079 align:start position:0%
flaws in in the in the way that we
 
00:46:42.069 --> 00:46:42.079 align:start position:0%
approach this I know this is a
 
00:46:45.150 --> 00:46:45.160 align:start position:0%
philosophical point but I'd like to see
 
00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:46.390 align:start position:0%
philosophical point but I'd like to see
a

00:46:46.390 --> 00:46:46.400 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:49.960 align:start position:0%
a I think we should look to have a
 
00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
greater state of ownership from the
 
00:46:56.230 --> 00:46:56.240 align:start position:0%
committee chairs as to as to what these
 
00:46:58.109 --> 00:46:58.119 align:start position:0%
various committees and commissions are
 
00:47:01.109 --> 00:47:01.119 align:start position:0%
up to and whether or not we want them to
 
00:47:03.790 --> 00:47:03.800 align:start position:0%
continue uh We've we've had a lot of
 
00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
activity since since the coid crisis
 
00:47:11.390 --> 00:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
where in many cases uh these commissions
 
00:47:13.309 --> 00:47:13.319 align:start position:0%
and committies have been overcome by
 
00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
events and haven't met in years and I
 
00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:20.640 align:start position:0%
think that we those deserve a hard look
 
00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
say are they really if they haven't met
 
00:47:25.870 --> 00:47:25.880 align:start position:0%
in years are they really not necessary
 
00:47:28.230 --> 00:47:28.240 align:start position:0%
maybe they
 
00:47:32.750 --> 00:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
are I can think of one where
 
00:47:39.069 --> 00:47:39.079 align:start position:0%
uh in the uh Edna world the issue of of
 
00:47:43.069 --> 00:47:43.079 align:start position:0%
statistics of of of race and ethnic
 
00:47:46.349 --> 00:47:46.359 align:start position:0%
backgrounds and so forth uh was was
 
00:47:50.589 --> 00:47:50.599 align:start position:0%
looking to have its its own committee uh
 
00:47:54.910 --> 00:47:54.920 align:start position:0%
to oversee you know that status and what
 
00:47:56.950 --> 00:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
we found was
 
00:47:58.950 --> 00:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
what the the chair of the that committee
 
00:48:01.309 --> 00:48:01.319 align:start position:0%
found was that UNH was providing that
 
00:48:05.470 --> 00:48:05.480 align:start position:0%
free of charge uh to the to us to the
 
00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
legislature and the need for the a
 
00:48:11.230 --> 00:48:11.240 align:start position:0%
committee to go gather that same data
 
00:48:13.829 --> 00:48:13.839 align:start position:0%
was superflous and we should just accept
 
00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
what UNH was was doing review it and the
 
00:48:18.910 --> 00:48:18.920 align:start position:0%
committee could could control it from
 
00:48:21.109 --> 00:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
that from there we need need a a
 
00:48:22.670 --> 00:48:22.680 align:start position:0%
separate committee or a separate
 
00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
commission to run that so so then that
 
00:48:27.069 --> 00:48:27.079 align:start position:0%
should just one example but there may be
 
00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:28.880 align:start position:0%
several other examples like that out
 
00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
there where what we what we want the
 
00:48:34.870 --> 00:48:34.880 align:start position:0%
good the good work that that needs to be
 
00:48:38.109 --> 00:48:38.119 align:start position:0%
done that we want is available to us and
 
00:48:40.750 --> 00:48:40.760 align:start position:0%
or available to the legislature and
 
00:48:43.589 --> 00:48:43.599 align:start position:0%
there may be a better or and less
 
00:48:47.309 --> 00:48:47.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:49.710 --> 00:48:49.720 align:start position:0%
information well we are stop we're here
 
00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
to do whatever you want us to do so um
 
00:48:54.549 --> 00:48:54.559 align:start position:0%
moving forward obviously we'll have the
 
00:48:58.309 --> 00:48:58.319 align:start position:0%
information for you on the 16th and um
 
00:49:00.670 --> 00:49:00.680 align:start position:0%
and then we could go from there uh just
 
00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
whatever you'd like us to do no you're
 
00:49:04.670 --> 00:49:04.680 align:start position:0%
doing a great job we appreciate thank
 
00:49:08.309 --> 00:49:08.319 align:start position:0%
you had hadn't you identified several
 
00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:10.440 align:start position:0%
commissions that hadn't met or had you
 
00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
gone through again we gave you the
 
00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
list last week I'm sorry because I
 
00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
thought you've done some work on updated
 
00:49:21.589 --> 00:49:21.599 align:start position:0%
there's 12 of them I believe right now
 
00:49:24.030 --> 00:49:24.040 align:start position:0%
12:15 and you all got a chart last week
 
00:49:26.230 --> 00:49:26.240 align:start position:0%
and the last column gave list of where
 
00:49:28.470 --> 00:49:28.480 align:start position:0%
they had met so we have done that we did
 
00:49:30.910 --> 00:49:30.920 align:start position:0%
go through see it was built again upon
 
00:49:33.789 --> 00:49:33.799 align:start position:0%
what you had done your commission and so
 
00:49:37.030 --> 00:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
we um gave that to but as far as we know
 
00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
the others have Mee like we found one
 
00:49:41.789 --> 00:49:41.799 align:start position:0%
that's been meeting regularly but they
 
00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
not all these commissions know that they
 
00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
need to get us the information to so
 
00:49:48.270 --> 00:49:48.280 align:start position:0%
that it's entered into our database they
 
00:49:49.549 --> 00:49:49.559 align:start position:0%
they start meeting on their own and
 
00:49:51.230 --> 00:49:51.240 align:start position:0%
again because they're involved within an
 
00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
agency they believe they only need to
 
00:49:55.589 --> 00:49:55.599 align:start position:0%
let the agency know and and after so
 
00:49:57.910 --> 00:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
many years while they're working really
 
00:49:59.390 --> 00:49:59.400 align:start position:0%
hard they just have no idea that if it
 
00:50:01.710 --> 00:50:01.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't they don't book their meetings
 
00:50:03.390 --> 00:50:03.400 align:start position:0%
here with our house Clerk or Senate
 
00:50:05.230 --> 00:50:05.240 align:start position:0%
clerk it's not going to get into the
 
00:50:08.309 --> 00:50:08.319 align:start position:0%
database that we maintain so some of
 
00:50:11.190 --> 00:50:11.200 align:start position:0%
that we we have found but um yes that
 
00:50:12.910 --> 00:50:12.920 align:start position:0%
most recent list
 
00:50:16.069 --> 00:50:16.079 align:start position:0%
um that's up to date as far as we could
 
00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:17.440 align:start position:0%
find a
 
00:50:21.549 --> 00:50:21.559 align:start position:0%
step and one of those you kind of
 
00:50:24.069 --> 00:50:24.079 align:start position:0%
Representative of kof's uh suggestion we
 
00:50:26.309 --> 00:50:26.319 align:start position:0%
identified one of them as a
 
00:50:28.870 --> 00:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
as a Target if you will
 
00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:33.240 align:start position:0%
to to decommission going forward I can't
 
00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
remember we we're going to ask one of
 
00:50:39.789 --> 00:50:39.799 align:start position:0%
the Committees to uh committee chairs
 
00:50:43.470 --> 00:50:43.480 align:start position:0%
to on I believe representative hunt had
 
00:50:46.549 --> 00:50:46.559 align:start position:0%
a bill that was U repealing education
 
00:50:51.190 --> 00:50:51.200 align:start position:0%
was it Commerce Commerce and so there I
 
00:50:53.069 --> 00:50:53.079 align:start position:0%
believe that the suggestion was that if
 
00:50:54.309 --> 00:50:54.319 align:start position:0%
there are other committees or
 
00:50:56.270 --> 00:50:56.280 align:start position:0%
commissions to be appeal that that would
 
00:50:59.710 --> 00:50:59.720 align:start position:0%
be a a vehicle that we could
 
00:51:02.670 --> 00:51:02.680 align:start position:0%
potentially would use it and would amend
 
00:51:05.470 --> 00:51:05.480 align:start position:0%
that and add other committees to that
 
00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:07.230 align:start position:0%
that and add other committees to that
right

00:51:07.230 --> 00:51:07.240 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:09.480 align:start position:0%
potentially um Mr chair I just want to
 
00:51:12.270 --> 00:51:12.280 align:start position:0%
mention there was also one and oh the
 
00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
speaker right here so he
 
00:51:17.710 --> 00:51:17.720 align:start position:0%
came thank you Mr Speaker I appreciate
 
00:51:24.349 --> 00:51:24.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:24.359 --> 00:51:30.349 align:start position:0%
 
usting

00:51:30.349 --> 00:51:30.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:36.430 --> 00:51:36.440 align:start position:0%
yours so this is where we are right
 
00:51:43.750 --> 00:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:46.190 --> 00:51:46.200 align:start position:0%
L can I just have a minute to see where
 
00:51:54.190 --> 00:51:54.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
gone uh
 
00:52:01.309 --> 00:52:01.319 align:start position:0%
um oh sorry I wasn't here earlier but
 
00:52:03.950 --> 00:52:03.960 align:start position:0%
um I guess there's a couple of things
 
00:52:06.430 --> 00:52:06.440 align:start position:0%
that have been brought to my attention
 
00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:07.430 align:start position:0%
that have been brought to my attention
and

00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:52:10.670 --> 00:52:10.680 align:start position:0%
um I know there's a question about
 
00:52:12.510 --> 00:52:12.520 align:start position:0%
whether putting a new bill in or using
 
00:52:15.030 --> 00:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
the retain bill that we already
 
00:52:18.789 --> 00:52:18.799 align:start position:0%
have uh I would strongly suggest we use
 
00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
the retain bill that we already
 
00:52:26.270 --> 00:52:26.280 align:start position:0%
have uh the other thing is I know that
 
00:52:29.190 --> 00:52:29.200 align:start position:0%
and and Deborah and a few others put a
 
00:52:32.670 --> 00:52:32.680 align:start position:0%
list of uh committees
 
00:52:36.030 --> 00:52:36.040 align:start position:0%
that I think there's 15 16 that they
 
00:52:38.430 --> 00:52:38.440 align:start position:0%
suggested that might be
 
00:52:41.710 --> 00:52:41.720 align:start position:0%
repealed uh I would strongly also
 
00:52:44.430 --> 00:52:44.440 align:start position:0%
suggest that you bring in the the
 
00:52:48.150 --> 00:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
whoever is the contacting that and and
 
00:52:51.230 --> 00:52:51.240 align:start position:0%
ask them if they are doing anything or
 
00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
they have done anything or they're going
 
00:52:55.750 --> 00:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
to do anything before you just put them
 
00:52:57.349 --> 00:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
on the
 
00:53:03.349 --> 00:53:03.359 align:start position:0%
list and uh the third thing is uh I
 
00:53:04.710 --> 00:53:04.720 align:start position:0%
understand Mr chairman you were looking
 
00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
at getting all the chairs in and talking
 
00:53:09.990 --> 00:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
to them I'm not sure that would be
 
00:53:12.630 --> 00:53:12.640 align:start position:0%
beneficial to you a lot of the chairs we
 
00:53:13.870 --> 00:53:13.880 align:start position:0%
have are
 
00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
new and frankly I doubt if they have a
 
00:53:19.870 --> 00:53:19.880 align:start position:0%
knowledge of a lot of the commissions
 
00:53:21.950 --> 00:53:21.960 align:start position:0%
that are out there at this time that may
 
00:53:23.349 --> 00:53:23.359 align:start position:0%
be something you might want to look at
 
00:53:26.270 --> 00:53:26.280 align:start position:0%
down the road but I think you know at
 
00:53:28.870 --> 00:53:28.880 align:start position:0%
this point in time I mean maybe John
 
00:53:30.589 --> 00:53:30.599 align:start position:0%
Hutt knows everything in his committee
 
00:53:32.829 --> 00:53:32.839 align:start position:0%
but uh realistically a lot of the other
 
00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
new chairman I don't think really know
 
00:53:37.589 --> 00:53:37.599 align:start position:0%
uh what commissions are underneath them
 
00:53:40.309 --> 00:53:40.319 align:start position:0%
and what they've actually done and I'm
 
00:53:43.750 --> 00:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
not sure if that would be you know a
 
00:53:47.750 --> 00:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
useful you use of time at this at this
 
00:53:50.349 --> 00:53:50.359 align:start position:0%
point I agree I I think what we're
 
00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
looking for is a to create a sense of
 
00:53:58.510 --> 00:53:58.520 align:start position:0%
ownership so that the chairs would
 
00:54:03.190 --> 00:54:03.200 align:start position:0%
own the issues with their with their u
 
00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
under their umbrella if you will make
 
00:54:07.630 --> 00:54:07.640 align:start position:0%
sure they understand that oh by the way
 
00:54:10.870 --> 00:54:10.880 align:start position:0%
you have 20 committees that fan out
 
00:54:14.710 --> 00:54:14.720 align:start position:0%
underneath you and so if we Define that
 
00:54:17.789 --> 00:54:17.799 align:start position:0%
help help them Define that then that
 
00:54:20.270 --> 00:54:20.280 align:start position:0%
might kind of clear the weather a little
 
00:54:22.670 --> 00:54:22.680 align:start position:0%
bit and see which ones should they go
 
00:54:25.630 --> 00:54:25.640 align:start position:0%
after either consolidate or get rid of
 
00:54:28.510 --> 00:54:28.520 align:start position:0%
and that might be a useful tool a little
 
00:54:30.950 --> 00:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
bit down the road but I think at this
 
00:54:33.549 --> 00:54:33.559 align:start position:0%
point if we concentrate on what the list
 
00:54:35.670 --> 00:54:35.680 align:start position:0%
you have and I don't even what that list
 
00:54:39.069 --> 00:54:39.079 align:start position:0%
is at this point and uh and see if we
 
00:54:41.470 --> 00:54:41.480 align:start position:0%
can't get that done because I can tell
 
00:54:46.150 --> 00:54:46.160 align:start position:0%
you and I I I think uh representative
 
00:54:47.470 --> 00:54:47.480 align:start position:0%
Wilhelm you've already gone through the
 
00:54:50.109 --> 00:54:50.119 align:start position:0%
list as I have a couple of times we've
 
00:54:51.750 --> 00:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
got about another 30 that have already
 
00:54:54.230 --> 00:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
been filed this year yeah we had that
 
00:54:57.789 --> 00:54:57.799 align:start position:0%
list so uh you know I I've gone through
 
00:55:00.870 --> 00:55:00.880 align:start position:0%
it twice and yeah
 
00:55:04.589 --> 00:55:04.599 align:start position:0%
I well yeah I I'm not sure I want to see
 
00:55:09.069 --> 00:55:09.079 align:start position:0%
it uh but we we do have another 30 or so
 
00:55:11.230 --> 00:55:11.240 align:start position:0%
so if we get rid of 15 we're still we're
 
00:55:14.630 --> 00:55:14.640 align:start position:0%
still behind uh you know but I I would
 
00:55:18.030 --> 00:55:18.040 align:start position:0%
strongly uh ask that you you know that's
 
00:55:20.630 --> 00:55:20.640 align:start position:0%
the next step you might want to go
 
00:55:23.630 --> 00:55:23.640 align:start position:0%
with good suggestion thank you Mr
 
00:55:25.990 --> 00:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
Speaker I I'll try and answer any
 
00:55:28.390 --> 00:55:28.400 align:start position:0%
questions but I know the staff has done
 
00:55:30.069 --> 00:55:30.079 align:start position:0%
a tremendous job putting this stuff
 
00:55:32.789 --> 00:55:32.799 align:start position:0%
together for your uh I honestly got to
 
00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
say it wasn't
 
00:55:39.990 --> 00:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
me no an and her staff and along with
 
00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
Deb Childs have done an outstanding job
 
00:55:47.109 --> 00:55:47.119 align:start position:0%
helping us you know focus on what what
 
00:55:49.309 --> 00:55:49.319 align:start position:0%
we can uh what we can work on what's
 
00:55:52.109 --> 00:55:52.119 align:start position:0%
available to us and also steer us away
 
00:55:54.230 --> 00:55:54.240 align:start position:0%
from those things that that aren't going
 
00:55:56.029 --> 00:55:56.039 align:start position:0%
to be helpful
 
00:55:58.270 --> 00:55:58.280 align:start position:0%
and create help create some timelines
 
00:56:01.789 --> 00:56:01.799 align:start position:0%
about we uh you you have in front of you
 
00:56:05.309 --> 00:56:05.319 align:start position:0%
the tri I do and I will uh I will
 
00:56:08.430 --> 00:56:08.440 align:start position:0%
uh look at it I haven't seen it myself
 
00:56:09.309 --> 00:56:09.319 align:start position:0%
but I
 
00:56:12.109 --> 00:56:12.119 align:start position:0%
will let me ask you this put you on the
 
00:56:13.309 --> 00:56:13.319 align:start position:0%
spot a little bit do you have any
 
00:56:15.670 --> 00:56:15.680 align:start position:0%
specific goals you'd like to see us
 
00:56:18.670 --> 00:56:18.680 align:start position:0%
achieve uh in terms of reducing the
 
00:56:22.670 --> 00:56:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:24.670 --> 00:56:24.680 align:start position:0%
commissions if it was up to me I'd
 
00:56:25.910 --> 00:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
probably get rid of just about every
 
00:56:27.309 --> 00:56:27.319 align:start position:0%
single one of them but that's not
 
00:56:28.870 --> 00:56:28.880 align:start position:0%
reality and that's not what's going to
 
00:56:31.510 --> 00:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
happen so I think realistically we have
 
00:56:33.789 --> 00:56:33.799 align:start position:0%
to go after the ones that either aren't
 
00:56:37.950 --> 00:56:37.960 align:start position:0%
meeting haven't met or uh you know have
 
00:56:41.670 --> 00:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
really no intention of meeting and then
 
00:56:43.870 --> 00:56:43.880 align:start position:0%
at some point I still think there's a
 
00:56:45.349 --> 00:56:45.359 align:start position:0%
lot of them out there especially in
 
00:56:48.029 --> 00:56:48.039 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services uh you know
 
00:56:49.589 --> 00:56:49.599 align:start position:0%
there's so many of them out there I
 
00:56:52.150 --> 00:56:52.160 align:start position:0%
can't believe that we can't start
 
00:56:55.430 --> 00:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
combining some of those well I speaking
 
00:56:57.549 --> 00:56:57.559 align:start position:0%
of that particular committee I've spoken
 
00:57:01.069 --> 00:57:01.079 align:start position:0%
with Wayne McDonald about bringing uh
 
00:57:04.430 --> 00:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
himself his vice chair and the uh
 
00:57:07.430 --> 00:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
ranking member of his Committee in to
 
00:57:10.510 --> 00:57:10.520 align:start position:0%
discuss that that issue specifically I
 
00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
know he's a new chair to that committee
 
00:57:16.710 --> 00:57:16.720 align:start position:0%
so U well maybe he can help educate us
 
00:57:19.349 --> 00:57:19.359 align:start position:0%
and we educate him along with an's help
 
00:57:21.670 --> 00:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
as to what's in front of him that that
 
00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
the other one is education they've got a
 
00:57:27.150 --> 00:57:27.160 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount education and and
 
00:57:28.710 --> 00:57:28.720 align:start position:0%
health and ement
 
00:57:31.150 --> 00:57:31.160 align:start position:0%
services I've lost track of
 
00:57:35.390 --> 00:57:35.400 align:start position:0%
them I just so Mr speaker thank you for
 
00:57:38.630 --> 00:57:38.640 align:start position:0%
coming um so would your thought be for
 
00:57:41.470 --> 00:57:41.480 align:start position:0%
the 12 or whatever that um staff has
 
00:57:44.069 --> 00:57:44.079 align:start position:0%
identified the commissions that haven't
 
00:57:46.829 --> 00:57:46.839 align:start position:0%
been meeting that we could maybe use a
 
00:57:49.230 --> 00:57:49.240 align:start position:0%
process like we had used before and have
 
00:57:50.750 --> 00:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
an agency
 
00:57:53.510 --> 00:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
representative that is responsible plus
 
00:57:55.349 --> 00:57:55.359 align:start position:0%
the chair of the committee to come and
 
00:57:57.870 --> 00:57:57.880 align:start position:0%
talk about that committee's activities
 
00:58:00.589 --> 00:58:00.599 align:start position:0%
and then the the our committee could
 
00:58:02.589 --> 00:58:02.599 align:start position:0%
make a recommendation based on that
 
00:58:05.549 --> 00:58:05.559 align:start position:0%
input whether to because we could have I
 
00:58:07.990 --> 00:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
mean when we did it before we we would
 
00:58:09.750 --> 00:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
meet for a couple hours and we could
 
00:58:12.670 --> 00:58:12.680 align:start position:0%
have you know several of the people come
 
00:58:16.549 --> 00:58:16.559 align:start position:0%
in in one meeting and then you could
 
00:58:18.309 --> 00:58:18.319 align:start position:0%
talk about it at the end of the meeting
 
00:58:20.589 --> 00:58:20.599 align:start position:0%
and kind of decide objectively how you
 
00:58:23.270 --> 00:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
thought it would proceed so after I mean
 
00:58:26.150 --> 00:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
if we're able to do that in a not you
 
00:58:28.789 --> 00:58:28.799 align:start position:0%
know in the next know six weeks or
 
00:58:31.029 --> 00:58:31.039 align:start position:0%
whatever your idea would be that we try
 
00:58:33.789 --> 00:58:33.799 align:start position:0%
to amend a retained Bill maybe through
 
00:58:36.670 --> 00:58:36.680 align:start position:0%
pledge admin as opposed to a going to
 
00:58:39.549 --> 00:58:39.559 align:start position:0%
rules with a late filed bill or or I
 
00:58:42.029 --> 00:58:42.039 align:start position:0%
think it might be hard but I think it
 
00:58:43.510 --> 00:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
would be a lot easier using that
 
00:58:45.470 --> 00:58:45.480 align:start position:0%
retained Bill than it would be to file a
 
00:58:47.670 --> 00:58:47.680 align:start position:0%
new bill yeah and I that's exactly what
 
00:58:50.470 --> 00:58:50.480 align:start position:0%
I was going for is just bringing in
 
00:58:52.430 --> 00:58:52.440 align:start position:0%
somebody from the agency or the the
 
00:58:54.710 --> 00:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
chairman or yeah whatever we did it
 
00:58:56.390 --> 00:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
before it worked really well right and
 
00:58:57.750 --> 00:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
and find
 
00:59:01.910 --> 00:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
out why if when why and all that stuff
 
00:59:05.150 --> 00:59:05.160 align:start position:0%
you know and uh maybe even though it's
 
00:59:08.470 --> 00:59:08.480 align:start position:0%
been identified maybe they plan on doing
 
00:59:11.029 --> 00:59:11.039 align:start position:0%
something or maybe there's a you know a
 
00:59:12.829 --> 00:59:12.839 align:start position:0%
real good reason why they haven't done
 
00:59:14.870 --> 00:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
something well and sometimes they
 
00:59:17.029 --> 00:59:17.039 align:start position:0%
actually recommend repeal they'll come
 
00:59:18.829 --> 00:59:18.839 align:start position:0%
in and say you know what really we don't
 
00:59:21.109 --> 00:59:21.119 align:start position:0%
need this anymore and you'd maybe be
 
00:59:23.430 --> 00:59:23.440 align:start position:0%
doing us a favor by repealing it so you
 
00:59:25.910 --> 00:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
don't really know right until until you
 
00:59:28.589 --> 00:59:28.599 align:start position:0%
have them come in and based on the work
 
00:59:31.789 --> 00:59:31.799 align:start position:0%
um an has you probably know which agency
 
00:59:34.470 --> 00:59:34.480 align:start position:0%
and and and how to reach out for the
 
00:59:37.190 --> 00:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
ones that aren't
 
00:59:39.630 --> 00:59:39.640 align:start position:0%
meeting I mean I've told you before we
 
00:59:42.309 --> 00:59:42.319 align:start position:0%
had a situation where it was like a a
 
00:59:45.870 --> 00:59:45.880 align:start position:0%
County finance committee that hadn't met
 
00:59:48.510 --> 00:59:48.520 align:start position:0%
really since the dawn of time and Health
 
00:59:50.549 --> 00:59:50.559 align:start position:0%
and Human Services came in and said this
 
00:59:54.069 --> 00:59:54.079 align:start position:0%
is a commission that exists for very spe
 
00:59:56.390 --> 00:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
very specific specific circumstances but
 
00:59:58.670 --> 00:59:58.680 align:start position:0%
if they don't exist we can't proceed one
 
01:00:01.270 --> 01:00:01.280 align:start position:0%
way or another so you know they were
 
01:00:03.510 --> 01:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
really so that particular one we didn't
 
01:00:06.390 --> 01:00:06.400 align:start position:0%
recommend repealing but they may have a
 
01:00:09.270 --> 01:00:09.280 align:start position:0%
different view on it now um but they do
 
01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
sometimes they're like yeah take it away
 
01:00:13.870 --> 01:00:13.880 align:start position:0%
we haven't met in five years and you can
 
01:00:15.270 --> 01:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
take it away you know I'll be happy I
 
01:00:17.109 --> 01:00:17.119 align:start position:0%
mean you just you can't predict that and
 
01:00:18.829 --> 01:00:18.839 align:start position:0%
they're really the ones that know the
 
01:00:21.270 --> 01:00:21.280 align:start position:0%
most about what's happening and not the
 
01:00:22.950 --> 01:00:22.960 align:start position:0%
standing committee
 
01:00:25.230 --> 01:00:25.240 align:start position:0%
chairs right that that's that was my
 
01:00:27.470 --> 01:00:27.480 align:start position:0%
point yeah one of the things that we are
 
01:00:30.589 --> 01:00:30.599 align:start position:0%
I think uh we can declare hopefully an
 
01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:34.240 align:start position:0%
early success is the trifold that we're
 
01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh it's under development right now
 
01:00:39.150 --> 01:00:39.160 align:start position:0%
close to finishing is something that
 
01:00:43.910 --> 01:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
David's going to take to OS and provide
 
01:00:46.510 --> 01:00:46.520 align:start position:0%
input to legislators who are getting
 
01:00:50.349 --> 01:00:50.359 align:start position:0%
ready to propose an LSR for new
 
01:00:52.829 --> 01:00:52.839 align:start position:0%
committees or new commissions and make
 
01:00:55.109 --> 01:00:55.119 align:start position:0%
making sure that they understand there
 
01:00:58.670 --> 01:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
is a process to follow now legis
 
01:01:01.270 --> 01:01:01.280 align:start position:0%
legislators can still choose not to
 
01:01:03.069 --> 01:01:03.079 align:start position:0%
follow the process but at least
 
01:01:04.710 --> 01:01:04.720 align:start position:0%
hopefully this will give them some
 
01:01:08.710 --> 01:01:08.720 align:start position:0%
guidance uh and and we we're GNA I think
 
01:01:11.510 --> 01:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
is it is in December have an education
 
01:01:13.230 --> 01:01:13.240 align:start position:0%
session with
 
01:01:17.950 --> 01:01:17.960 align:start position:0%
them um with new legislators as to not
 
01:01:19.990 --> 01:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
new but legislators before the next
 
01:01:22.430 --> 01:01:22.440 align:start position:0%
session that this is the the process
 
01:01:23.630 --> 01:01:23.640 align:start position:0%
that we expect that they're going to
 
01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:24.950 align:start position:0%
that we expect that they're going to
follow

01:01:24.950 --> 01:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
follow
 
01:01:27.470 --> 01:01:27.480 align:start position:0%
most of the
 
01:01:30.910 --> 01:01:30.920 align:start position:0%
time so in advance we want to thank
 
01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:32.470 align:start position:0%
time so in advance we want to thank
David

01:01:32.470 --> 01:01:32.480 align:start position:0%
David
 
01:01:36.390 --> 01:01:36.400 align:start position:0%
for doing that and and Ann and and
 
01:01:37.910 --> 01:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
Deborah for
 
01:01:41.390 --> 01:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
creating and and the supporting staff it
 
01:01:44.470 --> 01:01:44.480 align:start position:0%
is a lot of work we do appreciate it Mr
 
01:01:46.109 --> 01:01:46.119 align:start position:0%
chair I just I'm I'm trying to figure
 
01:01:48.630 --> 01:01:48.640 align:start position:0%
out the timing here if we want to amend
 
01:01:50.710 --> 01:01:50.720 align:start position:0%
a retained bill and the retained bills
 
01:01:52.789 --> 01:01:52.799 align:start position:0%
are supposed to be reported out by the
 
01:01:55.390 --> 01:01:55.400 align:start position:0%
Committees by November 17
 
01:01:57.109 --> 01:01:57.119 align:start position:0%
were sort of on
 
01:02:00.870 --> 01:02:00.880 align:start position:0%
a tight or what what would you think
 
01:02:04.269 --> 01:02:04.279 align:start position:0%
what I suggest is uh depending on how
 
01:02:06.589 --> 01:02:06.599 align:start position:0%
many of those bills that how many of
 
01:02:09.109 --> 01:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
those uh commissions you've been given
 
01:02:11.549 --> 01:02:11.559 align:start position:0%
um you know your next uh session you
 
01:02:15.789 --> 01:02:15.799 align:start position:0%
concentrate on that so um I I would
 
01:02:17.349 --> 01:02:17.359 align:start position:0%
think you could probably get an answer
 
01:02:20.309 --> 01:02:20.319 align:start position:0%
in 15 minutes or so per commission I
 
01:02:22.470 --> 01:02:22.480 align:start position:0%
don't think you need a much longer than
 
01:02:24.230 --> 01:02:24.240 align:start position:0%
that to find out what they've done or if
 
01:02:27.309 --> 01:02:27.319 align:start position:0%
they doing anything or they plan to and
 
01:02:29.150 --> 01:02:29.160 align:start position:0%
that way there within
 
01:02:31.829 --> 01:02:31.839 align:start position:0%
maybe you know maybe one good solid day
 
01:02:33.589 --> 01:02:33.599 align:start position:0%
you could find out all the information
 
01:02:35.349 --> 01:02:35.359 align:start position:0%
on them and then you could keep on
 
01:02:37.029 --> 01:02:37.039 align:start position:0%
moving on on the other stuff you want to
 
01:02:39.269 --> 01:02:39.279 align:start position:0%
do and that way they would allow the
 
01:02:42.470 --> 01:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
plenty of time to get it over to uh you
 
01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
know that retained bill over and and and
 
01:02:47.190 --> 01:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
amend it yeah and you have a suggestion
 
01:02:48.910 --> 01:02:48.920 align:start position:0%
how to get that information yes it's
 
01:02:50.950 --> 01:02:50.960 align:start position:0%
already there if you pull out the chart
 
01:02:52.710 --> 01:02:52.720 align:start position:0%
that we gave you at the last meeting the
 
01:02:55.950 --> 01:02:55.960 align:start position:0%
last column list what the status is of
 
01:02:58.710 --> 01:02:58.720 align:start position:0%
every one of those whether it's repr h
 
01:03:00.470 --> 01:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
was going to repeal one believe somebody
 
01:03:02.589 --> 01:03:02.599 align:start position:0%
else is going to repeal one one group
 
01:03:05.069 --> 01:03:05.079 align:start position:0%
has been meeting regularly since Co but
 
01:03:07.309 --> 01:03:07.319 align:start position:0%
they haven't been here so I believe
 
01:03:09.470 --> 01:03:09.480 align:start position:0%
there may be a few that the committee
 
01:03:11.670 --> 01:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
will have to investigate but it's all
 
01:03:13.870 --> 01:03:13.880 align:start position:0%
there on the last column so you have it
 
01:03:16.789 --> 01:03:16.799 align:start position:0%
all laid out for you as well so with an
 
01:03:20.230 --> 01:03:20.240 align:start position:0%
explanation um and um and I believe
 
01:03:22.069 --> 01:03:22.079 align:start position:0%
there should be a contact person there
 
01:03:25.390 --> 01:03:25.400 align:start position:0%
as well do you need a copy of that P
 
01:03:28.349 --> 01:03:28.359 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean not sure I have a copy if I
 
01:03:31.390 --> 01:03:31.400 align:start position:0%
have forgot send to but I mean yeah
 
01:03:33.829 --> 01:03:33.839 align:start position:0%
that's just the way we did it the staff
 
01:03:36.910 --> 01:03:36.920 align:start position:0%
I uh identified the right person at the
 
01:03:38.990 --> 01:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
agency I mean some of these bills may
 
01:03:41.549 --> 01:03:41.559 align:start position:0%
all may be within one agency and that
 
01:03:44.190 --> 01:03:44.200 align:start position:0%
person came in and sometimes the chairs
 
01:03:46.109 --> 01:03:46.119 align:start position:0%
of the commission came in depending on
 
01:03:47.950 --> 01:03:47.960 align:start position:0%
what it was and sometimes they didn't
 
01:03:50.150 --> 01:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
but I mean we got a whole lot of
 
01:03:52.950 --> 01:03:52.960 align:start position:0%
information from the from the agencies
 
01:03:56.430 --> 01:03:56.440 align:start position:0%
we we took them a agency by agency work
 
01:03:59.190 --> 01:03:59.200 align:start position:0%
really the committee wants an additional
 
01:04:02.309 --> 01:04:02.319 align:start position:0%
copy of what was passed out at the last
 
01:04:04.390 --> 01:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
meeting maybe an
 
01:04:13.349 --> 01:04:13.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:16.829 --> 01:04:16.839 align:start position:0%
it just you Karen yeah I'll I'll BR you
 
01:04:19.390 --> 01:04:19.400 align:start position:0%

01:04:23.470 --> 01:04:23.480 align:start position:0%
I don't okay okay so so representative
 
01:04:25.910 --> 01:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
you set or is
 
01:04:29.670 --> 01:04:29.680 align:start position:0%
available do your your legi admin
 
01:04:31.589 --> 01:04:31.599 align:start position:0%
uh email
 
01:04:34.309 --> 01:04:34.319 align:start position:0%
works yeah okay all right we can make a
 
01:04:37.190 --> 01:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
hard copy before you leave today okay
 
01:04:39.230 --> 01:04:39.240 align:start position:0%
and and I'm happy to just take a look at
 
01:04:42.150 --> 01:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
it and talk to and so we can I mean and
 
01:04:44.150 --> 01:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
make a recommendation based on our
 
01:04:46.670 --> 01:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
previous experience on on the best way
 
01:04:48.750 --> 01:04:48.760 align:start position:0%
to proceed for that there's one that we
 
01:04:51.589 --> 01:04:51.599 align:start position:0%
selected representative cof that was the
 
01:04:56.349 --> 01:04:56.359 align:start position:0%
uh the educate well no was korous one it
 
01:04:57.870 --> 01:04:57.880 align:start position:0%
was the one that representative hunt was
 
01:04:59.470 --> 01:04:59.480 align:start position:0%
repealing right and now we're going to
 
01:05:01.309 --> 01:05:01.319 align:start position:0%
use that as a model I
 
01:05:03.750 --> 01:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
guess I think that the speaker just
 
01:05:06.029 --> 01:05:06.039 align:start position:0%
mentioned there is legislation in
 
01:05:07.630 --> 01:05:07.640 align:start position:0%
legislative Administration it's the
 
01:05:10.150 --> 01:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
Senate bill that was retained and I
 
01:05:11.390 --> 01:05:11.400 align:start position:0%
believe that you were going to use as
 
01:05:12.870 --> 01:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
your vehicle you you've talked about
 
01:05:15.630 --> 01:05:15.640 align:start position:0%
that right before and I think um and I
 
01:05:18.029 --> 01:05:18.039 align:start position:0%
do know that representative uh Greg Hill
 
01:05:20.309 --> 01:05:20.319 align:start position:0%
the chairman has plans to schedule a
 
01:05:22.789 --> 01:05:22.799 align:start position:0%
work session for October
 
01:05:26.910 --> 01:05:26.920 align:start position:0%
11th so so the information needs to get
 
01:05:28.950 --> 01:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
to um the chairman to know that you're
 
01:05:31.589 --> 01:05:31.599 align:start position:0%
working on that and you going to be
 
01:05:34.589 --> 01:05:34.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:39.470 --> 01:05:39.480 align:start position:0%
that yes so so I think once we get that
 
01:05:43.069 --> 01:05:43.079 align:start position:0%
as an example then we can we
 
01:05:47.109 --> 01:05:47.119 align:start position:0%
can we can edit it to include any other
 
01:05:50.510 --> 01:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
bills we want to add to it yes So the
 
01:05:52.870 --> 01:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
plan is we won't execute on the 11th
 
01:05:54.670 --> 01:05:54.680 align:start position:0%
we'll hold it
 
01:06:00.109 --> 01:06:00.119 align:start position:0%
until uh we find out's the number
 
01:06:03.309 --> 01:06:03.319 align:start position:0%
sb84 uh do we the rest of us or any of
 
01:06:07.069 --> 01:06:07.079 align:start position:0%
us need to be there to help testify or
 
01:06:09.910 --> 01:06:09.920 align:start position:0%

01:06:16.829 --> 01:06:16.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:21.870 --> 01:06:21.880 align:start position:0%

01:07:35.829 --> 01:07:35.839 align:start position:0%
30th all right
 
01:07:39.470 --> 01:07:39.480 align:start position:0%
and you can come in costume right and
 
01:07:41.470 --> 01:07:41.480 align:start position:0%
could you help us make sure that gets
 
01:07:44.190 --> 01:07:44.200 align:start position:0%
posted oh yes absolutely that's again
 
01:07:46.150 --> 01:07:46.160 align:start position:0%
Jamie's listening right now so Jamie
 
01:07:48.190 --> 01:07:48.200 align:start position:0%
will thanks
 
01:07:51.910 --> 01:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
Jamie good okay and and the one for the
 
01:07:54.549 --> 01:07:54.559 align:start position:0%
16th has already been posted I I noticed
 
01:08:04.150 --> 01:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:07.990 --> 01:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
record we good Mr and do you know offand
 
01:08:10.190 --> 01:08:10.200 align:start position:0%
if there if the bills
 
01:08:12.430 --> 01:08:12.440 align:start position:0%
are like if a bunch of them are Health
 
01:08:14.029 --> 01:08:14.039 align:start position:0%
and Human Services or a bunch of them
 
01:08:15.950 --> 01:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
are education or they're all different
 
01:08:17.950 --> 01:08:17.960 align:start position:0%
agencies they're all different represent
 
01:08:21.349 --> 01:08:21.359 align:start position:0%
EV yes they are there's it's a
 
01:08:23.950 --> 01:08:23.960 align:start position:0%
variety and some may not even fall under
 
01:08:26.829 --> 01:08:26.839 align:start position:0%
an agency I don't know so for instance I
 
01:08:28.390 --> 01:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
believe that the wet commission is one
 
01:08:30.550 --> 01:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
of them and I don't know if that's would
 
01:08:32.229 --> 01:08:32.239 align:start position:0%
come under public works or where that
 
01:08:34.550 --> 01:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
would go so there are some that are like
 
01:08:36.470 --> 01:08:36.480 align:start position:0%
that and then you're right I think
 
01:08:39.030 --> 01:08:39.040 align:start position:0%
someone mentioned the demographics um
 
01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
that this the chair mentioned that I
 
01:08:43.669 --> 01:08:43.679 align:start position:0%
believe that might be there but as as
 
01:08:47.349 --> 01:08:47.359 align:start position:0%
you we do know some one in Science and
 
01:08:48.789 --> 01:08:48.799 align:start position:0%
Tech I think representative Harrington
 
01:08:49.990 --> 01:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned that should be repealed
 
01:08:51.910 --> 01:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
representative hunt has another one
 
01:08:54.829 --> 01:08:54.839 align:start position:0%
there it was part of the leftovers that
 
01:08:56.550 --> 01:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
you had from your commission we knew
 
01:09:00.269 --> 01:09:00.279 align:start position:0%
they we need to continue um you need to
 
01:09:02.030 --> 01:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
continue work on those so we found that
 
01:09:04.430 --> 01:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
list and then um a whole bunch of
 
01:09:06.349 --> 01:09:06.359 align:start position:0%
different staff looked at everything and
 
01:09:09.149 --> 01:09:09.159 align:start position:0%
we we added to this list and the speaker
 
01:09:10.950 --> 01:09:10.960 align:start position:0%
was hoping we could get up to 20 but we
 
01:09:13.550 --> 01:09:13.560 align:start position:0%
I think we get up to
 
01:09:17.669 --> 01:09:17.679 align:start position:0%
15 well this to follow the speaker's
 
01:09:21.829 --> 01:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
lead um education and HHS appear to be
 
01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
very fertile ground for for us to be
 
01:09:28.110 --> 01:09:28.120 align:start position:0%
looking at so so we'll keep that in mind
 
01:09:30.990 --> 01:09:31.000 align:start position:0%
as we start looking at these the
 
01:09:33.870 --> 01:09:33.880 align:start position:0%
different areas in terms of quantities I
 
01:09:36.390 --> 01:09:36.400 align:start position:0%
mean if if we've got a for example if
 
01:09:40.669 --> 01:09:40.679 align:start position:0%
HHS has 50 of them outstanding then uh
 
01:09:42.590 --> 01:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
we should be able to round a few of few
 
01:09:45.189 --> 01:09:45.199 align:start position:0%
of them up to to put on the list Mr
 
01:09:47.189 --> 01:09:47.199 align:start position:0%
chair some of it will take a while as
 
01:09:48.669 --> 01:09:48.679 align:start position:0%
represent tell because some of those do
 
01:09:50.189 --> 01:09:50.199 align:start position:0%
have Federal Regulations so we're going
 
01:09:52.269 --> 01:09:52.279 align:start position:0%
to have to work closely with the agency
 
01:09:54.669 --> 01:09:54.679 align:start position:0%
people sure to find so we'll grabb your
 
01:09:56.630 --> 01:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
list from
 
01:10:01.350 --> 01:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
20 2021 we'll take that and we'll just
 
01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:03.960 align:start position:0%
and we'll just contact all those people
 
01:10:05.510 --> 01:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
I believe Pam probably has all records
 
01:10:06.990 --> 01:10:07.000 align:start position:0%
so we'll know who to call the agency to
 
01:10:09.229 --> 01:10:09.239 align:start position:0%
ask them again is this still in
 
01:10:11.510 --> 01:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
existence and maybe that's our starting
 
01:10:13.950 --> 01:10:13.960 align:start position:0%
point and we'll go from there well appre
 
01:10:16.750 --> 01:10:16.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate you being here aronas uh we
 
01:10:19.910 --> 01:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
need your guidance oh you're very kind
 
01:10:22.630 --> 01:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:26.709 align:start position:0%
 
listening

01:10:26.709 --> 01:10:26.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
and speak of the devil here are the here
 
01:10:30.750 --> 01:10:30.760 align:start position:0%
are the handouts that we just was
 
01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:35.550 align:start position:0%
are the handouts that we just was
speaking

01:10:35.550 --> 01:10:35.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:38.189 --> 01:10:38.199 align:start position:0%
about Jen just mentioned that the first
 
01:10:41.229 --> 01:10:41.239 align:start position:0%
one is the extra one
 
01:10:45.030 --> 01:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
um but as you can see
 
01:10:49.870 --> 01:10:49.880 align:start position:0%
