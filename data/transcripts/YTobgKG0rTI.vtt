thank you this bill is simple it it it
 
00:07:31.029 --> 00:07:31.039 align:start position:0%
creates a vehicle for people to sue
 
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
social media for blocking content um and
 
00:07:37.869 --> 00:07:37.879 align:start position:0%
uh of course not all content if it's
 
00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:41.080 align:start position:0%
injurious to children or or uh or or
 
00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:44.560 align:start position:0%
indecent uh there's no such right but
 
00:07:46.589 --> 00:07:46.599 align:start position:0%
otherwise if it's a point of view that
 
00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:49.120 align:start position:0%
the social media doesn't like they
 
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
they've been uh shutting people down and
 
00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:53.720 align:start position:0%
that that INF fringes right on the
 
00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:55.800 align:start position:0%
Second Amendment they've got some
 
00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
Protections in federal law this won't
 
00:07:59.309 --> 00:07:59.319 align:start position:0%
conflict with federal law because it's a
 
00:08:02.149 --> 00:08:02.159 align:start position:0%
the state carel in that federal law and
 
00:08:04.149 --> 00:08:04.159 align:start position:0%
if depending on your political Viewpoint
 
00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:06.520 align:start position:0%
you might want some things to be shut
 
00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
down that you don't agree with but the
 
00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:11.960 align:start position:0%
worm turns and uh we we need to protect
 
00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
our first amendment rights if I said
 
00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
second I meant First Amendment rights
 
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
for free speech and that's that's the
 
00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
gist of it I had a late Amendment which
 
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
changes the amount that could be suited
 
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:27.000 align:start position:0%

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
problem in New Hampshire that you're
 
00:08:53.269 --> 00:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
aware of that this is directed at um
 
00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:54.920 align:start position:0%
it's happening across the country it's
 
00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:56.800 align:start position:0%
happened to my son who's happens to be
 
00:08:59.269 --> 00:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
an antivaxer in California he's been
 
00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
shut down several times after developing
 
00:09:04.389 --> 00:09:04.399 align:start position:0%
followings of 30,000 Plus on Twitter
 
00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:06.160 align:start position:0%
it's happening in New Hampshire I I
 
00:09:08.069 --> 00:09:08.079 align:start position:0%
don't have a specific example but yes
 
00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:12.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:14.269 align:start position:0%
 
everywhere

00:09:14.269 --> 00:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
everywhere
 
00:09:14.279 --> 00:09:16.389 align:start position:0%
everywhere
and

00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:16.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:19.720 align:start position:0%
is and I guess I guess that's a um just
 
00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:22.120 align:start position:0%
a followup to that question you you
 
00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
indicated Andy Andy vaxer uh your son
 
00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:29.160 align:start position:0%
being an Andy vaxer and a and I'm Pres
 
00:09:31.269 --> 00:09:31.279 align:start position:0%
ass uming that the social media site has
 
00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:34.640 align:start position:0%
indicated that his talking about any
 
00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:36.670 align:start position:0%
indicated that his talking about any
vacc

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:36.680 align:start position:0%
vacc
 
00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:39.800 align:start position:0%
vaccination is prohibited on their site
 
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
period yes it shut them down several
 
00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
times this is one example because it's a
 
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:47.320 align:start position:0%
personal example that I'm aware of but
 
00:09:49.389 --> 00:09:49.399 align:start position:0%
uh it's no problem finding people to
 
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
come forward and say there's a concern
 
00:09:56.269 --> 00:09:56.279 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire it's a a PO it's U
 
00:09:58.829 --> 00:09:58.839 align:start position:0%
it's uh something if they have ties with
 
00:10:00.389 --> 00:10:00.399 align:start position:0%
the pharmaceutical industry they're
 
00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:02.200 align:start position:0%
going to shut them down because it's a
 
00:10:04.509 --> 00:10:04.519 align:start position:0%
bread and butter to them it may be
 
00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:06.120 align:start position:0%
political Point points of view they
 
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
don't particularly care for and we've SE
 
00:10:12.829 --> 00:10:12.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:15.959 align:start position:0%
that are there other questions yes
 
00:10:15.959 --> 00:10:19.910 align:start position:0%
that are there other questions yes
representative

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:22.600 align:start position:0%
Burch thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:26.360 align:start position:0%
you represented for taking my question
 
00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:30.200 align:start position:0%
um I'm generally not a conservative in
 
00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
my political Outlook though there are
 
00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:37.720 align:start position:0%
some aspects that I believe in uh but I
 
00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
have a question about the
 
00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:46.760 align:start position:0%
idea that the uh the state of New
 
00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire according to this bill should
 
00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:51.839 align:start position:0%
be telling private
 
00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
companies um what they uh uh how they do
 
00:10:58.150 --> 00:10:58.160 align:start position:0%
their business in terms of what they
 
00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:01.320 align:start position:0%
post allow to be posted and what they
 
00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:04.600 align:start position:0%
don't allow to be posted so are you
 
00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
comfortable with saying to private
 
00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:11.480 align:start position:0%
companies uh what their speech uh what
 
00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:14.680 align:start position:0%
speech they allow what speech they don't
 
00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:16.680 align:start position:0%
uh there's a point in time when a
 
00:11:19.629 --> 00:11:19.639 align:start position:0%
private company gets so big that it that
 
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
it's it it it becomes a common carrier
 
00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
and and uh should should be open to all
 
00:11:29.629 --> 00:11:29.639 align:start position:0%
uh if if it's a small entity so big a
 
00:11:31.629 --> 00:11:31.639 align:start position:0%
deal but when they get it to Big to be
 
00:11:34.389 --> 00:11:34.399 align:start position:0%
as big as Facebook and Twitter they have
 
00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
control over uh uh over uh messages uh
 
00:11:43.389 --> 00:11:43.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
concern thank
 
00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:48.880 align:start position:0%

UPS hi there thank you so much for your
 
00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
time um so I am in support of House Bill
 
00:12:58.870 --> 00:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
133 my name is Christine wheelie I am
 
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
have uh one heart Ministries I'm in
 
00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:03.240 align:start position:0%
Minnesota but I also am part of the
 
00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:06.440 align:start position:0%
special for of Liberty and um I wanted
 
00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:08.920 align:start position:0%
to just address really quickly the um
 
00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
point that y all made about um how this
 
00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
affects people in New Hampshire so my
 
00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:15.560 align:start position:0%
Ministry is is Nationwide and we have
 
00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
connections with people in New Hampshire
 
00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
and I personally have been censored um
 
00:13:22.389 --> 00:13:22.399 align:start position:0%
uh so I can I can give an example but I
 
00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:24.680 align:start position:0%
think the main thing is that um the
 
00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
major social media websites they've
 
00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
reached a critical mass and they have
 
00:13:30.269 --> 00:13:30.279 align:start position:0%
done it basically through fraud false
 
00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
advertising and deceptive trade
 
00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:34.160 align:start position:0%
practices and because Facebook Twitter
 
00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:36.959 align:start position:0%
and all of those media sites are so
 
00:13:39.269 --> 00:13:39.279 align:start position:0%
large now people like me and other
 
00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
people constituents in your in your uh
 
00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
State you know when we're censored for
 
00:13:47.829 --> 00:13:47.839 align:start position:0%
instance well my example was um you know
 
00:13:50.189 --> 00:13:50.199 align:start position:0%
I posted something in regards to my time
 
00:13:53.389 --> 00:13:53.399 align:start position:0%
of ministry in Nevada that was censored
 
00:13:55.389 --> 00:13:55.399 align:start position:0%
and was told it was sexually explicit
 
00:13:57.829 --> 00:13:57.839 align:start position:0%
when that was absolutely not not at all
 
00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:00.040 align:start position:0%
anything nothing not one thing in there
 
00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:02.240 align:start position:0%
was that it was a video of the new of
 
00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
the Nevada state government um signing
 
00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:08.600 align:start position:0%
the six electoral votes or whatever for
 
00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
for for Trump but it was not even like
 
00:14:12.749 --> 00:14:12.759 align:start position:0%
it was it was an answer to my prayer
 
00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:14.920 align:start position:0%
specifically of my time in Nevada that
 
00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
was censored and said it was sexually
 
00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
sexually explicit so that is happening
 
00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:22.160 align:start position:0%
that's just one example and um so we you
 
00:14:25.509 --> 00:14:25.519 align:start position:0%
know as as an a citizen we and the
 
00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:26.920 align:start position:0%
people in New Hampshire those that I
 
00:14:29.389 --> 00:14:29.399 align:start position:0%
know even on Facebook who see those
 
00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:31.240 align:start position:0%
posts and things it's taken away our our
 
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
rights and it's taken away um you know
 
00:14:35.069 --> 00:14:35.079 align:start position:0%
regardless of political party or
 
00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
religious views um social media should
 
00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
not be
 
00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
censoring um its users in the way that
 
00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
they are and we all know that that is
 
00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:46.040 align:start position:0%
happening and so I personally um I
 
00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
support this bill and and running this
 
00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
legislation across because I hear of all
 
00:14:53.269 --> 00:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
the the stories whether it's a Democrat
 
00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:54.920 align:start position:0%
Republican none of that really matters
 
00:14:56.670 --> 00:14:56.680 align:start position:0%
it's really about just them taking
 
00:14:59.230 --> 00:14:59.240 align:start position:0%
control over um
 
00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
you know they have their own interest in
 
00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
it in mind and so this will give a right
 
00:15:07.069 --> 00:15:07.079 align:start position:0%
to those citizens who have been defamed
 
00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:09.880 align:start position:0%
who have been censored to actually you
 
00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:12.040 align:start position:0%
know uh stand up for their themselves
 
00:15:15.629 --> 00:15:15.639 align:start position:0%
and and with the um and be able to sue
 
00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
uh with that
 
00:15:25.189 --> 00:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:28.189 --> 00:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
has Christine I think you got uh muted
 
00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
reason I think I think my phone muted or

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:49.160 align:start position:0%

00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:52.480 align:start position:0%

ideas and freedom to make them known
 
00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:44.840 align:start position:0%
private companies are operating under
 
00:17:46.669 --> 00:17:46.679 align:start position:0%
the guise of public free exchange of
 
00:17:48.789 --> 00:17:48.799 align:start position:0%
ideas and now have grown so big they now
 
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
choose the narrative that people are
 
00:17:52.909 --> 00:17:52.919 align:start position:0%
allowed to see literal hate speech and
 
00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:54.640 align:start position:0%
child porn is allowed and although
 
00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
reported is considered not against

Community standards but people are are
 
00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:00.799 align:start position:0%
literally dying and suffering for life
 
00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
because of lack of access to informed

00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
states are carrying this bill both
 
00:20:48.029 --> 00:20:48.039 align:start position:0%
Democrats and Republicans are the prime
 
00:20:51.149 --> 00:20:51.159 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this bill um it was written
 
00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
out of a lot of this has been litigated
 
00:20:55.669 --> 00:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
a lot in Federal District Court it is
 
00:20:57.549 --> 00:20:57.559 align:start position:0%
one of the hottest Topics in the country
 
00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
it's a b partisan issue my background
 
00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:01.960 align:start position:0%
very quickly I went to V undergrad V law
 
00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
school as a Judge Advocate General and
 
00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:04.760 align:start position:0%
worked briefly as assistant United
 
00:21:06.669 --> 00:21:06.679 align:start position:0%
States Attorney here's Four Points
 
00:21:08.669 --> 00:21:08.679 align:start position:0%
number one well the the question
 
00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:10.200 align:start position:0%
presented is what's the best solution to
 
00:21:12.149 --> 00:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
the pro ongoing problem of social media
 
00:21:13.909 --> 00:21:13.919 align:start position:0%
censorship which is completely out of
 
00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
control is it an executive order by the
 
00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
president is it Senator Josh Holly's
 
00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:19.880 align:start position:0%
attempts to repeal section 230 of the
 
00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
communications decency act or is it
 
00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
represented the pl's bill House Bill 133
 
00:21:25.669 --> 00:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
and the answer is it's representative
 
00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
pl's bill because it falls Within What's
 
00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
called the state law exemption under
 
00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:33.640 align:start position:0%
Section 230 it's subsection e paragraph
 
00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
three and so what what does that mean in
 
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
plain English what is section 230 well
 
00:21:41.269 --> 00:21:41.279 align:start position:0%
section 230 is in a is a statute created
 
00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:43.240 align:start position:0%
by the federal Congress in the 1990s
 
00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
that get creates uh immunity for
 
00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
internet intermediaries and the way I
 
00:21:49.029 --> 00:21:49.039 align:start position:0%
have to understand it is through an
 
00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:51.080 align:start position:0%
example so the best way to understand it
 
00:21:52.789 --> 00:21:52.799 align:start position:0%
is if someone post a defamatory comment
 
00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:55.480 align:start position:0%
on YouTube the defame party can sue the
 
00:21:57.630 --> 00:21:57.640 align:start position:0%
person that defamed them uh but if they
 
00:22:00.029 --> 00:22:00.039 align:start position:0%
name YouTube in the lawsuit then YouTube
 
00:22:02.029 --> 00:22:02.039 align:start position:0%
could invoke a section 230 immunity
 
00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:03.640 align:start position:0%
defense and be dismissed from the case
 
00:22:05.669 --> 00:22:05.679 align:start position:0%
so that's a good use of section 230 it's
 
00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:08.120 align:start position:0%
actually good law but it's being abused
 
00:22:11.149 --> 00:22:11.159 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire out substantially it's
 
00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
being abused in this way when when
 
00:22:15.029 --> 00:22:15.039 align:start position:0%
people in this state get censored for
 
00:22:16.549 --> 00:22:16.559 align:start position:0%
their religious or political worldviews
 
00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:18.440 align:start position:0%
and they they try to bring any kind of
 
00:22:20.789 --> 00:22:20.799 align:start position:0%
cause of action against tech tech
 
00:22:22.669 --> 00:22:22.679 align:start position:0%
companies are then invoking section 230
 
00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:24.200 align:start position:0%
immunity defense and saying your honor
 
00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
we're merely
 
00:22:28.549 --> 00:22:28.559 align:start position:0%
editorializing and so well our our I is
 
00:22:30.269 --> 00:22:30.279 align:start position:0%
that section 230 the communication the
 
00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:31.960 align:start position:0%
communications decency Act was created
 
00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
to protect decent speech it was never
 
00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
created to promote deceptive trade
 
00:22:37.909 --> 00:22:37.919 align:start position:0%
practices so that's point one the best
 
00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:40.360 align:start position:0%
solution is representative pl's Bill
 
00:22:43.149 --> 00:22:43.159 align:start position:0%
point two is what does this bill say the
 
00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:46.240 align:start position:0%
so the stop Social House Bill 133 says
 
00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
this it says going forward in the state
 
00:22:50.029 --> 00:22:50.039 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire any retailer well it
 
00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:52.240 align:start position:0%
says going forward if a social media
 
00:22:54.909 --> 00:22:54.919 align:start position:0%
website censors a user for religious or
 
00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:57.240 align:start position:0%
political speech and that social media
 
00:22:59.510 --> 00:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
website was always marketing itself from
 
00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
its Inception as being free fair and
 
00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
open to the public and if they have more
 
00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:05.200 align:start position:0%
than 75 million subscribers if that kind
 
00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:07.400 align:start position:0%
of social media website censors then the
 
00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
injured party can seek up to 75,000 in
 
00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
statutory damages attorney fees actual
 
00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:15.720 align:start position:0%
damages and other forms of relief 75,000
 
00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
is a magic number because it gives a
 
00:23:19.149 --> 00:23:19.159 align:start position:0%
litigant the option to litigate in
 
00:23:21.149 --> 00:23:21.159 align:start position:0%
federal district court or in State Court
 
00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:22.440 align:start position:0%
under what's called diversity
 
00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:24.440 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction the fact that it says
 
00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:26.360 align:start position:0%
attorneys can the injured party can seek
 
00:23:29.029 --> 00:23:29.039 align:start position:0%
attorneys Fe fees means that local
 
00:23:30.669 --> 00:23:30.679 align:start position:0%
lawyers would have incentive to
 
00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
represent uh your constituents when
 
00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:34.720 align:start position:0%
they're being censored and shut down by
 
00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
social media websites because of a thing
 
00:23:38.269 --> 00:23:38.279 align:start position:0%
called the American rule which says you
 
00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:40.480 align:start position:0%
got to have a statute that allows there
 
00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
to be recovery in order for a litigant
 
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
to seek that um so at point three this
 
00:23:49.149 --> 00:23:49.159 align:start position:0%
is very important contract law is a
 
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
state law issue now when you sign up for
 
00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:52.480 align:start position:0%
social media websites you're entering
 
00:23:54.149 --> 00:23:54.159 align:start position:0%
into an adhesion contract which means
 
00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
the cours won't really take it very
 
00:23:57.909 --> 00:23:57.919 align:start position:0%
seriously however those social media
 
00:23:59.789 --> 00:23:59.799 align:start position:0%
websites are reaching into New Hampshire
 
00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
and inducing your constituents to sign
 
00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:05.200 align:start position:0%
up to use their services and when those
 
00:24:06.909 --> 00:24:06.919 align:start position:0%
you know contract law is a state law
 
00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:09.080 align:start position:0%
issue and when your constituent signs up
 
00:24:11.789 --> 00:24:11.799 align:start position:0%
for Facebook Twitter or YouTube and they
 
00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
you know after they've been promised
 
00:24:14.789 --> 00:24:14.799 align:start position:0%
that it's free fair and open to all
 
00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
ideas only to turn around and be
 
00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:18.520 align:start position:0%
censored okay that's not that's what
 
00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
attorney general b called it the
 
00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
greatest bait and switch of all time but
 
00:24:23.789 --> 00:24:23.799 align:start position:0%
that that kind of commercial practice
 
00:24:27.149 --> 00:24:27.159 align:start position:0%
amounts to breach a contract bad faith
 
00:24:29.149 --> 00:24:29.159 align:start position:0%
unfair deal ing unjust enrichment
 
00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
fraudulent inducement this is a
 
00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
deceptive trade practice bill it's a
 
00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:34.360 align:start position:0%
progressive Bill really because it gets
 
00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:36.320 align:start position:0%
existing law to catch up to modern day
 
00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
technology point three the underlying
 
00:24:40.389 --> 00:24:40.399 align:start position:0%
constitutional federal legal
 
00:24:42.549 --> 00:24:42.559 align:start position:0%
prescription for this bill is the first
 
00:24:44.789 --> 00:24:44.799 align:start position:0%
amendment free exercise clause free
 
00:24:47.669 --> 00:24:47.679 align:start position:0%
exercise clause and the um free speech
 
00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
Clause of the First Amendment now New
 
00:24:50.669 --> 00:24:50.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's Constitution says the same
 
00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
thing because the free the first
 
00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
amendment applies to the government it
 
00:24:55.909 --> 00:24:55.919 align:start position:0%
restrains the government from
 
00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
encroaching on free speech so it's
 
00:24:59.750 --> 00:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
really restraint but it can be used as
 
00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:04.520 align:start position:0%
as a trampoline as a catalyst when um in
 
00:25:07.909 --> 00:25:07.919 align:start position:0%
a situation like this where the uh tech
 
00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:10.440 align:start position:0%
companies have set out purposely to
 
00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
induce people to sign up to their
 
00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
websites only to turn around and sensor
 
00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
them they've induced people to sign up
 
00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:16.840 align:start position:0%
because they marketed themselves as
 
00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
being open all ideas ideas and they've
 
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
reached critical mass as a result of
 
00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:22.520 align:start position:0%
that they have set out and purposely
 
00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
created a digital Public Square for them
 
00:25:26.149 --> 00:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
to turn around and censor your
 
00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:28.600 align:start position:0%
constituents now is per say deceptive
 
00:25:30.789 --> 00:25:30.799 align:start position:0%
trade practice deceptive trade practice
 
00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
is not a protected form of free speech
 
00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:34.520 align:start position:0%
the opponents of this bill generally
 
00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:37.240 align:start position:0%
show I make one more point I'll stop
 
00:25:40.029 --> 00:25:40.039 align:start position:0%
yeah if you would just kind of wrap up
 
00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:41.880 align:start position:0%
yes sir sorry this is this very complex
 
00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
First Amendment law so I'm just trying
 
00:25:44.549 --> 00:25:44.559 align:start position:0%
to be helpful to the committee on that
 
00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:46.760 align:start position:0%
on that topic last Point there's some
 
00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
exemption is exceptions they're common
 
00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:51.200 align:start position:0%
sense if the if if the issues are
 
00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
pornographic in nature if it's caused to
 
00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
immediate acts of violence if it's false
 
00:25:57.990 --> 00:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
impersonation uh respectfully Mr
 
00:25:59.510 --> 00:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
chairman there are three proposed
 
00:26:01.149 --> 00:26:01.159 align:start position:0%
amendments we would suggest we've had
 
00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:02.840 align:start position:0%
hearings on this bill in seven different
 
00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:05.000 align:start position:0%
states this past week and there's a
 
00:26:06.669 --> 00:26:06.679 align:start position:0%
couple of amend a couple of small
 
00:26:07.909 --> 00:26:07.919 align:start position:0%
amendments we've been picking up in
 
00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
different states number one we would
 
00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:12.200 align:start position:0%
recommend under subsection 8 sub
 
00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:15.240 align:start position:0%
paragraph a we recommend that uh a
 
00:26:17.029 --> 00:26:17.039 align:start position:0%
subparagraph in addition that to be
 
00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
added under eight that if the con if the
 
00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:21.640 align:start position:0%
speech constitutes copyright or
 
00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:23.960 align:start position:0%
trademark infringement that the social
 
00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:26.520 align:start position:0%
media website could censor that if the
 
00:26:28.909 --> 00:26:28.919 align:start position:0%
content is access ly violent that would
 
00:26:30.549 --> 00:26:30.559 align:start position:0%
be Point number nine under that same
 
00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
section then they should be able to
 
00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:34.600 align:start position:0%
censor and then finally if the content
 
00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:37.240 align:start position:0%
constitutes harassing spam of a
 
00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
commercial but not of a political or
 
00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
religious nature uh they can be censored
 
00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
and I'll stop with that thank you for
 
00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:45.600 align:start position:0%

allow viewers to post comments and
 
00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
reviews and the definition of social
 
00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:50.600 align:start position:0%
media website in this bill is so broad
 
00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:53.000 align:start position:0%
that it would Encompass many companies
 
00:28:55.149 --> 00:28:55.159 align:start position:0%
such as MPA member companies that allow
 
00:28:56.990 --> 00:28:57.000 align:start position:0%
users to share comments or product
 
00:28:59.909 --> 00:28:59.919 align:start position:0%

sports fans to comment on online stories
 
00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
and it's sometimes necessary
 
00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:08.120 align:start position:0%
unfortunately for Disney to remove
 
00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:10.120 align:start position:0%
certain inappropriate material shared by
 
00:29:12.789 --> 00:29:12.799 align:start position:0%

order to ensure a positive online
 
00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:17.000 align:start position:0%
experience for the rest of their viewers
 
00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
but by doing so this bill could then
 
00:29:21.389 --> 00:29:21.399 align:start position:0%
make the Walt Disney Company liable for
 
00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:23.640 align:start position:0%
$75,000 every time they have to do this
 
00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:26.240 align:start position:0%
plus Equitable damages punitive damages
 
00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
and other forms of relief
 
00:29:29.269 --> 00:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
while we don't believe our member
 
00:29:30.909 --> 00:29:30.919 align:start position:0%
companies are the intended targets of
 
00:29:32.669 --> 00:29:32.679 align:start position:0%
this legislation the definition as I
 
00:29:35.149 --> 00:29:35.159 align:start position:0%
said is so broad that they unfortunately
 
00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:37.000 align:start position:0%
would fall squarely within the scope of
 
00:29:39.029 --> 00:29:39.039 align:start position:0%
this bill and the new liability that the
 
00:29:40.669 --> 00:29:40.679 align:start position:0%
bill would create not just for our
 
00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:42.760 align:start position:0%
member companies but for many larger
 
00:29:45.149 --> 00:29:45.159 align:start position:0%
businesses that allow user generated
 
00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:47.320 align:start position:0%
content we also believe the bill is
 
00:29:49.789 --> 00:29:49.799 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional as an invasion of the
 
00:29:51.909 --> 00:29:51.919 align:start position:0%
editorial process that's barred by the
 
00:29:54.029 --> 00:29:54.039 align:start position:0%
First Amendment the First Amendment bars
 
00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:55.320 align:start position:0%
the state from interfering with
 
00:29:57.430 --> 00:29:57.440 align:start position:0%
editorial decisions including by
 
00:29:59.830 --> 00:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
websites and internet platforms about
 
00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:02.360 align:start position:0%
what to print or not to print and we
 
00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:04.760 align:start position:0%
also believe House Bill 133 would be
 
00:30:06.549 --> 00:30:06.559 align:start position:0%
barred by section 230 of the
 
00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
communication decency act section 230 as
 
00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
you of course know is the federal law
 
00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
that bars States from either imposing
 
00:30:15.669 --> 00:30:15.679 align:start position:0%
criminal liability or providing a civil
 
00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:17.600 align:start position:0%
cause of action against websites
 
00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:20.440 align:start position:0%
platforms social media sites and isps
 
00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:23.080 align:start position:0%
related to user generated content for
 
00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:24.880 align:start position:0%

on this bill um particularly
 
00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:04.840 align:start position:0%
representative Burch asked the question
 
00:32:09.389 --> 00:32:09.399 align:start position:0%
um how does House Bill 133 square with
 
00:32:12.789 --> 00:32:12.799 align:start position:0%
free market principles and how does the
 
00:32:14.789 --> 00:32:14.799 align:start position:0%
state um
 
00:32:17.710 --> 00:32:17.720 align:start position:0%
justify involving itself in what seems
 
00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:20.320 align:start position:0%
to be A Private Matter between a
 
00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:22.360 align:start position:0%
corporation and a
 
00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:26.360 align:start position:0%
user um big Tech operates in a
 
00:32:28.909 --> 00:32:28.919 align:start position:0%
government corrupt Market it exploits
 
00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
the government corrupted Market to its
 
00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
advantage and opposes free market
 
00:32:35.070 --> 00:32:35.080 align:start position:0%
reforms and therefore is not entitled to
 
00:32:36.789 --> 00:32:36.799 align:start position:0%

00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:41.760 align:start position:0%

free market objections to New Hampshire
 
00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:47.000 align:start position:0%
uh stepping up to protect Free Speech
 
00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:49.360 align:start position:0%
fails to recognize that the tech cartel
 
00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
neither formed nor operates under free
 
00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
market conditions big Tech would not and
 
00:32:56.430 --> 00:32:56.440 align:start position:0%
could not exist without government
 
00:32:57.990 --> 00:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
favortism and

protection eliminating those favoritism
 
00:33:03.789 --> 00:33:03.799 align:start position:0%
and protections is the ideal
 
00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
solution however uh in the absence of
 
00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:08.720 align:start position:0%

seen for a second um thank you Mr chair
 
00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:16.680 align:start position:0%
and thank you honorable members of the
 
00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:20.240 align:start position:0%
committee I will be pretty brief I think
 
00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
uh for the record my name is Ellen Reed
 
00:35:24.829 --> 00:35:24.839 align:start position:0%
I represent Rockingham 17 which is New
 
00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
Market in newfields I also teach
 
00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:30.280 align:start position:0%
American government in community college
 
00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:32.680 align:start position:0%
and uh every semester I teach my
 
00:35:34.829 --> 00:35:34.839 align:start position:0%
students quite a few things but I teach
 
00:35:37.270 --> 00:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
them obviously about the First Amendment
 
00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:38.560 align:start position:0%
and the various parts of the First
 
00:35:40.750 --> 00:35:40.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment one being the freedom of the
 
00:35:43.589 --> 00:35:43.599 align:start position:0%
press I teach them about the importance
 
00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:46.640 align:start position:0%
of media whether that influence be
 
00:35:49.309 --> 00:35:49.319 align:start position:0%
negative or positive on our democracy
 
00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:52.040 align:start position:0%
how much of an influence the media can
 
00:35:55.390 --> 00:35:55.400 align:start position:0%
have and um most importantly I think or
 
00:35:57.390 --> 00:35:57.400 align:start position:0%
one of the most important things I teach
 
00:36:02.109 --> 00:36:02.119 align:start position:0%
them is the fragility of democracy um
 
00:36:04.829 --> 00:36:04.839 align:start position:0%
most democracies have not stood for very
 
00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
long historically we are the oldest
 
00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:11.200 align:start position:0%
still functioning democracy and there
 
00:36:13.069 --> 00:36:13.079 align:start position:0%
are a few factors that lead to the
 
00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
stability of democracy I won't be labor
 
00:36:17.349 --> 00:36:17.359 align:start position:0%
all of those but I will emphasize that a
 
00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:20.280 align:start position:0%
well-informed public is absolutely
 
00:36:23.309 --> 00:36:23.319 align:start position:0%
crucial to a well-functioning democracy
 
00:36:26.829 --> 00:36:26.839 align:start position:0%
without a well-informed public by by
 
00:36:29.829 --> 00:36:29.839 align:start position:0%
definition people cannot then have the
 
00:36:31.390 --> 00:36:31.400 align:start position:0%
information to make informed decisions
 
00:36:33.109 --> 00:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
on choosing their
 
00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:36.520 align:start position:0%
representatives so the media is and
 
00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:38.800 align:start position:0%
we've gone through a lot of recent years
 
00:36:41.230 --> 00:36:41.240 align:start position:0%
of of issues with the media and um
 
00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:44.640 align:start position:0%
Integrity in the media but the media is
 
00:36:47.349 --> 00:36:47.359 align:start position:0%
absolutely inextricably linked to the
 
00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:49.280 align:start position:0%
functioning of our democracy in fact
 
00:36:51.349 --> 00:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
it's called Uh the fourth estate or
 
00:36:53.829 --> 00:36:53.839 align:start position:0%
fourth Branch because of that it is the
 
00:36:56.910 --> 00:36:56.920 align:start position:0%
way in which citizens have an ability to
 
00:36:59.309 --> 00:36:59.319 align:start position:0%
have a check on their government and
 
00:37:00.510 --> 00:37:00.520 align:start position:0%
because of that because of the
 
00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:02.280 align:start position:0%
importance of the media I'm introducing
 
00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
this here reporter Shield
 
00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:08.240 align:start position:0%
law um I do have to teach my students
 
00:37:10.270 --> 00:37:10.280 align:start position:0%
every year that despite the fact that we
 
00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
have a freedom of the press in some
 
00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
places in the country and it has
 
00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:16.520 align:start position:0%
happened um dozens and dozens of times
 
00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
in recent years uh judges can jail
 
00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
reporters for not disclosing their
 
00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:26.200 align:start position:0%
sources now it would be and it is
 
00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
whenever happens a tragic blow to
 
00:37:32.829 --> 00:37:32.839 align:start position:0%
democracy to weaken the media so that
 
00:37:37.589 --> 00:37:37.599 align:start position:0%
they cannot adequately Source material
 
00:37:39.109 --> 00:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
if their sources are unwilling to talk
 
00:37:40.910 --> 00:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
to them because they aren afraid that
 
00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:45.560 align:start position:0%
they would be exposed um then simply put
 
00:37:47.230 --> 00:37:47.240 align:start position:0%
the journalists can't really fully
 
00:37:49.309 --> 00:37:49.319 align:start position:0%
operate on the most sensitive and most
 
00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:51.200 align:start position:0%
important issues of our day and we've
 
00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
seen issues like this when it comes to
 
00:37:58.309 --> 00:37:58.319 align:start position:0%
um you know uh well I won't I go won't
 
00:37:59.510 --> 00:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
there's obviously Edward Snowden and
 
00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
juliia ass Sange and all of these issues
 
00:38:03.430 --> 00:38:03.440 align:start position:0%
that have happened but I just want to
 
00:38:07.829 --> 00:38:07.839 align:start position:0%
highlight the importance of a robust uh
 
00:38:10.829 --> 00:38:10.839 align:start position:0%
um media that can Source information
 
00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:13.000 align:start position:0%
particularly when it's damning to the
 
00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
government and particularly when those
 
00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:18.760 align:start position:0%
exposed those people who are sourcing
 
00:38:21.069 --> 00:38:21.079 align:start position:0%
that information if they were exposed
 
00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
might come to harm so uh the we are only
 
00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:27.960 align:start position:0%
one of 10 states that does not have a
 
00:38:30.910 --> 00:38:30.920 align:start position:0%
shield law in place in our current law
 
00:38:33.349 --> 00:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
uh Most states have some level of
 
00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
protection uh if we passed this bill as
 
00:38:39.630 --> 00:38:39.640 align:start position:0%
it stands right now which is extremely
 
00:38:41.109 --> 00:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
broadly written and I'll get to that in
 
00:38:43.829 --> 00:38:43.839 align:start position:0%
just one second we would join 17 states
 
00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
that have absolute protection for
 
00:38:49.109 --> 00:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
journalists States like Alabama Kentucky
 
00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
uh Nebraska
 
00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:52.720 align:start position:0%
Montana however I'm not necessarily
 
00:38:54.829 --> 00:38:54.839 align:start position:0%
advocating that we pass the bill as it
 
00:38:57.309 --> 00:38:57.319 align:start position:0%
is written right now um there are a
 
00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
number of uh factors that can influence
 
00:39:03.069 --> 00:39:03.079 align:start position:0%
this and so I anticipate questions as
 
00:39:04.309 --> 00:39:04.319 align:start position:0%
it's written right now would be things
 
00:39:07.109 --> 00:39:07.119 align:start position:0%
like well what defines a journalist or
 
00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:08.560 align:start position:0%
what if there's a particular type of
 
00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
Court scenario where you have to get a
 
00:39:13.309 --> 00:39:13.319 align:start position:0%
certain certain piece of information
 
00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:15.200 align:start position:0%
endangering public Liberty or Public
 
00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:17.680 align:start position:0%
Safety or whatever something like that
 
00:39:19.309 --> 00:39:19.319 align:start position:0%
and the reason I submitted this is
 
00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
because I didn't really my goal here is
 
00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:24.640 align:start position:0%
to have some protection for journalists
 
00:39:27.309 --> 00:39:27.319 align:start position:0%
my goal wasn't to dive into the weed on
 
00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:29.560 align:start position:0%
and try to advocate for particular
 
00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:32.280 align:start position:0%
definitions so Mo many states and my
 
00:39:34.430 --> 00:39:34.440 align:start position:0%
intention is to send this information to
 
00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:36.280 align:start position:0%
uh your committee right after this
 
00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
hearing with the hope that one or more
 
00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:41.000 align:start position:0%
committee members will reach out to me
 
00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:42.640 align:start position:0%
and be willing to work with me on an
 
00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
amendment that suits the needs of this
 
00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:47.880 align:start position:0%
particular committee but for example
 
00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
many states like Florida and Georgia put
 
00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:54.040 align:start position:0%
a um definition on the word journalist
 
00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
that that journalist has to be paid I do
 
00:39:58.510 --> 00:39:58.520 align:start position:0%
want to have the argument of well if
 
00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:00.680 align:start position:0%
it's a paid journalist are we then
 
00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
disenfranchising say people who blog or
 
00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
doing their own independent thing are we
 
00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:08.480 align:start position:0%
giving more preference to mainstream
 
00:40:10.349 --> 00:40:10.359 align:start position:0%
media these are questions that I would
 
00:40:12.390 --> 00:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
like the the Judiciary Committee to
 
00:40:13.950 --> 00:40:13.960 align:start position:0%
answer for themselves they're not
 
00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:16.240 align:start position:0%
positions that I particularly want to
 
00:40:19.069 --> 00:40:19.079 align:start position:0%
advocate for or against I just want
 
00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
would love this committee to take this
 
00:40:24.069 --> 00:40:24.079 align:start position:0%
issue seriously and engage in whatever
 
00:40:26.430 --> 00:40:26.440 align:start position:0%
language you all deem suitable to
 
00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:27.589 align:start position:0%
language you all deem suitable to
protect

00:40:27.589 --> 00:40:27.599 align:start position:0%
protect
 
00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
reporters um and then the the final
 
00:40:33.630 --> 00:40:33.640 align:start position:0%
thing is why New Hampshire New Hampshire
 
00:40:35.309 --> 00:40:35.319 align:start position:0%
as far as I know and there have been
 
00:40:36.750 --> 00:40:36.760 align:start position:0%
dozens and dozens of situations of
 
00:40:39.150 --> 00:40:39.160 align:start position:0%
reporters being jailed even for months
 
00:40:41.309 --> 00:40:41.319 align:start position:0%
um for not disclosing sources as far as
 
00:40:44.430 --> 00:40:44.440 align:start position:0%
I know New Hampshire has no such problem
 
00:40:48.109 --> 00:40:48.119 align:start position:0%
but when it comes to uh constitutional
 
00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
rights and this is certainly falls under
 
00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:52.440 align:start position:0%
that in terms of freedom of the press I
 
00:40:54.829 --> 00:40:54.839 align:start position:0%
am a strong believer that we put those
 
00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
rights out there affirmatively
 
00:40:59.349 --> 00:40:59.359 align:start position:0%
and not in a reactionary way dealing
 
00:41:01.109 --> 00:41:01.119 align:start position:0%
with the problem after it's already
 
00:41:03.349 --> 00:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
happened um and certainly the framers of
 
00:41:04.829 --> 00:41:04.839 align:start position:0%
our constitution felt the same that's
 
00:41:07.069 --> 00:41:07.079 align:start position:0%
why they took the steps to ensure the
 
00:41:09.470 --> 00:41:09.480 align:start position:0%
Liberties that they did it's also why we
 
00:41:11.109 --> 00:41:11.119 align:start position:0%
have the Ninth Amendment the ninth
 
00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
amendment of course for those of you who
 
00:41:15.829 --> 00:41:15.839 align:start position:0%
know uh states that all of the other
 
00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:16.960 align:start position:0%
amendments in the Bill of Rights
 
00:41:19.069 --> 00:41:19.079 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding there are no there are
 
00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
other rights that we have as a people
 
00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
that they did not enumerate and they
 
00:41:25.829 --> 00:41:25.839 align:start position:0%
went to the pred a whole amendment to
 
00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
say and those rights are also protected
 
00:41:31.710 --> 00:41:31.720 align:start position:0%
we just haven't enumerated them so I am
 
00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:33.960 align:start position:0%
uh a proponent of being assertive when
 
00:41:37.870 --> 00:41:37.880 align:start position:0%
it comes to uh protecting uh uh our
 
00:41:39.309 --> 00:41:39.319 align:start position:0%
individual freedoms that are guaranteed
 
00:41:42.910 --> 00:41:42.920 align:start position:0%
in our Constitution and uh with that I'm
 
00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
guess I'm happy to take any questions I
 
00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
just sincerely hope that this committee
 
00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
I know that you all are a busy committee
 
00:41:53.069 --> 00:41:53.079 align:start position:0%
but I hope that you all are willing to
 
00:41:55.390 --> 00:41:55.400 align:start position:0%
give it this particular issue about
 
00:41:59.030 --> 00:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
journalism um the time and effort that
 
00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:03.400 align:start position:0%
it I think it deserves and thank
 
00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:06.680 align:start position:0%
you are there questions for
 
00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:09.230 align:start position:0%
you are there questions for
representative

00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:12.790 --> 00:42:12.800 align:start position:0%
Reed I I guess I think you started to
 
00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
address do you consider a person who is
 
00:42:17.150 --> 00:42:17.160 align:start position:0%
a blogger a
 
00:42:20.430 --> 00:42:20.440 align:start position:0%
journalist um again this is there there
 
00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
would be Arguments for and against and
 
00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
my entire point is to strengthen
 
00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
protection of of of the the journalism
 
00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
community and not try to Define who is
 
00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:33.040 align:start position:0%
and isn't a journalist I think this
 
00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
committee is probably well equipped to
 
00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
make those decisions on their own there
 
00:42:39.109 --> 00:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
would be arguments that some bloggers
 
00:42:42.390 --> 00:42:42.400 align:start position:0%
have access um or have an independent
 
00:42:44.549 --> 00:42:44.559 align:start position:0%
voice that mainstream Media or other
 
00:42:46.990 --> 00:42:47.000 align:start position:0%
sources that would be able to pay
 
00:42:48.750 --> 00:42:48.760 align:start position:0%
professionally a journalist might not
 
00:42:50.190 --> 00:42:50.200 align:start position:0%
have so there's a good argument to
 
00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:52.200 align:start position:0%
protect bloggers but then where do you
 
00:42:54.349 --> 00:42:54.359 align:start position:0%
draw the line anybody can call
 
00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
themselves a blogger so it those types
 
00:42:59.510 --> 00:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
of questions I would love if the this
 
00:43:01.710 --> 00:43:01.720 align:start position:0%
committee even in a subcommittee or or
 
00:43:04.309 --> 00:43:04.319 align:start position:0%
work study work group um if you all
 
00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:05.960 align:start position:0%
could decide what you all think is the
 
00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:08.040 align:start position:0%
most appropriate so long as we are
 
00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
recognizing that the journalism
 
00:43:12.990 --> 00:43:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:15.200 align:start position:0%
protection representative bur did you
 
00:43:15.730 --> 00:43:15.740 align:start position:0%
have a
 
00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:18.670 align:start position:0%
have a
[Music]

00:43:18.670 --> 00:43:18.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
question yes it's and thank you
 
00:43:24.030 --> 00:43:24.040 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:26.480 align:start position:0%
not sure quite how to phrase it because
 
00:43:31.270 --> 00:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
because um when I read your bill uh it
 
00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
seemed so broad uh and didn't take into
 
00:43:39.109 --> 00:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
account uh the balancing that courts do
 
00:43:43.030 --> 00:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
when they issue uh delicates aenis like
 
00:43:45.870 --> 00:43:45.880 align:start position:0%
this uh and I gather from your testimony
 
00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
you're saying you have a good idea here
 
00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:50.240 align:start position:0%
and your opinion and you'd like the
 
00:43:53.470 --> 00:43:53.480 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee to uh come up with a
 
00:43:56.230 --> 00:43:56.240 align:start position:0%
uh answer is that basically where what
 
00:43:58.270 --> 00:43:58.280 align:start position:0%
you're saying well I don't expect the
 
00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
committee to start from Whole cloth I am
 
00:44:03.670 --> 00:44:03.680 align:start position:0%
about to uh send you the email I didn't
 
00:44:06.069 --> 00:44:06.079 align:start position:0%
want to get Lo getting lost before the
 
00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
hearing but send you an email now that
 
00:44:09.750 --> 00:44:09.760 align:start position:0%
you know it's coming with specific
 
00:44:11.950 --> 00:44:11.960 align:start position:0%
language examples in other states that I
 
00:44:14.230 --> 00:44:14.240 align:start position:0%
um various other states both uh
 
00:44:16.750 --> 00:44:16.760 align:start position:0%
conservative and and liberal leaning
 
00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
States uh that kind of narrowed us down
 
00:44:22.030 --> 00:44:22.040 align:start position:0%
what I'm asking is that the committee
 
00:44:24.109 --> 00:44:24.119 align:start position:0%
take it seriously enough to decide from
 
00:44:26.190 --> 00:44:26.200 align:start position:0%
those options which of those options a
 
00:44:27.589 --> 00:44:27.599 align:start position:0%
combination of those options is most
 
00:44:33.349 --> 00:44:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:41.630 --> 00:44:41.640 align:start position:0%
questions if if I could make a
 
00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
suggestion representative
 
00:44:47.349 --> 00:44:47.359 align:start position:0%
Reed we we you indicated we're a busy
 
00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
committee and we are and we're running
 
00:44:52.309 --> 00:44:52.319 align:start position:0%
out of time in terms of reporting out
 
00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
our bills and we already have a very
 
00:44:57.549 --> 00:44:57.559 align:start position:0%
busy agenda agenda and I
 
00:44:59.910 --> 00:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
certainly in terms
 
00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
of amending your bill to make it
 
00:45:04.750 --> 00:45:04.760 align:start position:0%
workable I don't think that's something
 
00:45:06.589 --> 00:45:06.599 align:start position:0%
that could happen in the time frame that
 
00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
we have our only alternative would be to
 
00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:11.640 align:start position:0%
hold on to the bill and do some work
 
00:45:14.030 --> 00:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
later if the committee elected to do
 
00:45:18.270 --> 00:45:18.280 align:start position:0%
that I guess the so my suggestion to you
 
00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
is if you think that there are changes
 
00:45:23.710 --> 00:45:23.720 align:start position:0%
that ought to be made I think you should
 
00:45:25.309 --> 00:45:25.319 align:start position:0%
probably be the one forming that
 
00:45:27.390 --> 00:45:27.400 align:start position:0%
Amendment instead of asking the
 
00:45:29.390 --> 00:45:29.400 align:start position:0%
committee to do that for
 
00:45:32.710 --> 00:45:32.720 align:start position:0%
you I I understand completely and my my
 
00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
goal was not to kind of off-put work
 
00:45:37.470 --> 00:45:37.480 align:start position:0%
onto the committee I just understood
 
00:45:40.390 --> 00:45:40.400 align:start position:0%
that perhaps I didn't want to assert
 
00:45:43.549 --> 00:45:43.559 align:start position:0%
whatever you know relatively arbitrary
 
00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:46.040 align:start position:0%
definitions that I might come up with
 
00:45:47.790 --> 00:45:47.800 align:start position:0%
over what the committee would want so
 
00:45:49.549 --> 00:45:49.559 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to come up with an amendment
 
00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
and uh that kind of reflects the average
 
00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
for the country the various States again
 
00:45:58.470 --> 00:45:58.480 align:start position:0%
I as I said 40 states have some sort of
 
00:46:00.790 --> 00:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
protection um and submit that to you all
 
00:46:02.710 --> 00:46:02.720 align:start position:0%
with the understanding that I'm saying
 
00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
right now it's not that I'm married to
 
00:46:06.910 --> 00:46:06.920 align:start position:0%
these particular ideas but if if doing
 
00:46:08.230 --> 00:46:08.240 align:start position:0%
that work ahead of time before you've
 
00:46:10.309 --> 00:46:10.319 align:start position:0%
had that discussion helps you all that's
 
00:46:13.870 --> 00:46:13.880 align:start position:0%
fine also if the committee decides that
 
00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:16.240 align:start position:0%
because of time you cannot have those
 
00:46:20.190 --> 00:46:20.200 align:start position:0%
discussions before crossover then um I
 
00:46:22.750 --> 00:46:22.760 align:start position:0%
would ask that you retain it and and uh
 
00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:24.400 align:start position:0%
look into it seriously when you have
 
00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
more time
 
00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
and yes representative Simpson do you
 
00:46:31.549 --> 00:46:31.559 align:start position:0%
have a
 
00:46:34.349 --> 00:46:34.359 align:start position:0%
question I do thank you Mr chair thank
 
00:46:36.109 --> 00:46:36.119 align:start position:0%
you representative Reed for taking my
 
00:46:38.030 --> 00:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
question some of the things that you're
 
00:46:40.349 --> 00:46:40.359 align:start position:0%
talking about make me think that the um
 
00:46:42.190 --> 00:46:42.200 align:start position:0%
press Association here in New Hampshire
 
00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
might be a good resource for you in
 
00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:47.200 align:start position:0%
these if you are going to think about an
 
00:46:49.549 --> 00:46:49.559 align:start position:0%
amendment on your own um and I wondered
 
00:46:50.990 --> 00:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
if you have a sense of whether they're
 
00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:54.720 align:start position:0%
open to that kind of conversation or um
 
00:46:57.870 --> 00:46:57.880 align:start position:0%
resourcing or support indeed it was
 
00:47:00.430 --> 00:47:00.440 align:start position:0%
actually and this is a conversation in
 
00:47:03.670 --> 00:47:03.680 align:start position:0%
the Hall of the lob some three years ago
 
00:47:05.309 --> 00:47:05.319 align:start position:0%
um with a member of the press
 
00:47:07.549 --> 00:47:07.559 align:start position:0%
Association that sparked my putting this
 
00:47:10.109 --> 00:47:10.119 align:start position:0%
in I have since I mean this is going to
 
00:47:12.670 --> 00:47:12.680 align:start position:0%
be a little bit maybe too honest I have
 
00:47:14.349 --> 00:47:14.359 align:start position:0%
desperately looked for this man's
 
00:47:16.309 --> 00:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
business card and I cannot remember who
 
00:47:18.910 --> 00:47:18.920 align:start position:0%
he is and I cannot seem to hunt him down
 
00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
so I don't know how to get a hold of him
 
00:47:23.549 --> 00:47:23.559 align:start position:0%
but I have uh welcomed a number of
 
00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
Journalism associations to participate
 
00:47:29.150 --> 00:47:29.160 align:start position:0%
with me um obviously if they are doing
 
00:47:30.549 --> 00:47:30.559 align:start position:0%
other things and prioritizing other
 
00:47:32.510 --> 00:47:32.520 align:start position:0%
things then um that can't be helped but
 
00:47:34.190 --> 00:47:34.200 align:start position:0%
I do welcome the New Hampshire
 
00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
journalism Association as well as other
 
00:47:39.270 --> 00:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:42.510 --> 00:47:42.520 align:start position:0%
that do you have a follow-up question
 
00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
representative I do if if you if you may
 
00:47:49.230 --> 00:47:49.240 align:start position:0%
um I think my question then is that I'm
 
00:47:51.230 --> 00:47:51.240 align:start position:0%
just wondering if you know if it's
 
00:47:55.750 --> 00:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
pressing for them as a group or if they
 
00:47:57.190 --> 00:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
and not that you presume to know what
 
00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
they what they think but I I guess I've
 
00:48:02.430 --> 00:48:02.440 align:start position:0%
had my own curiosity about how the
 
00:48:05.470 --> 00:48:05.480 align:start position:0%
federal law operates here and um
 
00:48:08.549 --> 00:48:08.559 align:start position:0%
wondering if you if you know how
 
00:48:11.069 --> 00:48:11.079 align:start position:0%
important it is for them to have this in
 
00:48:14.510 --> 00:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that's ke yes the federal
 
00:48:17.069 --> 00:48:17.079 align:start position:0%
there is no federal Shield law despite
 
00:48:19.750 --> 00:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
different journalism associations very
 
00:48:21.790 --> 00:48:21.800 align:start position:0%
repeatedly and very vifer usly
 
00:48:24.309 --> 00:48:24.319 align:start position:0%
advocating for it um it is something
 
00:48:25.950 --> 00:48:25.960 align:start position:0%
that just has not happened yet on the
 
00:48:27.990 --> 00:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
federal level despite happening on the
 
00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
state level in most of the country I
 
00:48:32.390 --> 00:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
don't think the New Hampshire
 
00:48:34.510 --> 00:48:34.520 align:start position:0%
Association finds it a particularly
 
00:48:37.230 --> 00:48:37.240 align:start position:0%
pressing issue in New Hampshire for the
 
00:48:38.910 --> 00:48:38.920 align:start position:0%
you know the reasons I already said we
 
00:48:41.910 --> 00:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
don't apparently have a a particular
 
00:48:44.430 --> 00:48:44.440 align:start position:0%
problem with journalists being jailed
 
00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
however as I said in my testimony when
 
00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
it comes to uh these types of individual
 
00:48:52.270 --> 00:48:52.280 align:start position:0%
freedoms that are guaranteed in the
 
00:48:53.789 --> 00:48:53.799 align:start position:0%
Constitution I believe in taking an
 
00:48:56.670 --> 00:48:56.680 align:start position:0%
affirmative stance and not waiting for
 
00:48:59.150 --> 00:48:59.160 align:start position:0%
whatever powers that may be come into
 
00:49:01.309 --> 00:49:01.319 align:start position:0%
power and then abuse that Authority I
 
00:49:02.549 --> 00:49:02.559 align:start position:0%
believe in having those Democratic
 
00:49:04.549 --> 00:49:04.559 align:start position:0%
safeguards in place to begin with as did
 
00:49:07.549 --> 00:49:07.559 align:start position:0%
the framers of the US
 
00:49:09.390 --> 00:49:09.400 align:start position:0%
Constitution thank you that's really
 
00:49:11.910 --> 00:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
helpful for me thanks any other
 
00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:14.400 align:start position:0%

00:50:24.309 --> 00:50:24.319 align:start position:0%
government subpoenas forcing reporters
 
00:50:27.430 --> 00:50:27.440 align:start position:0%

country the reporters committee supports
 
00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:42.240 align:start position:0%

00:50:57.069 --> 00:50:57.079 align:start position:0%
laws in
 
00:50:59.630 --> 00:50:59.640 align:start position:0%
place shield laws are important because
 
00:51:01.390 --> 00:51:01.400 align:start position:0%
reporters necessarily rely on
 
00:51:03.910 --> 00:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
confidential Communications with sources
 
00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
to report the news for public
 
00:51:08.069 --> 00:51:08.079 align:start position:0%
benefit compelling journalists to
 
00:51:09.670 --> 00:51:09.680 align:start position:0%
divulge confidential or even
 
00:51:11.950 --> 00:51:11.960 align:start position:0%
non-confidential Communications with
 
00:51:14.190 --> 00:51:14.200 align:start position:0%
sources chills news Gathering and
 
00:51:16.430 --> 00:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
deprives the public of important
 
00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
information in particular some of the
 
00:51:21.430 --> 00:51:21.440 align:start position:0%
most important stories uh have relied on
 
00:51:23.349 --> 00:51:23.359 align:start position:0%
confidential sources from the classic
 
00:51:25.950 --> 00:51:25.960 align:start position:0%
example of Watergate to reporting on the
 
00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:28.200 align:start position:0%
war on terror to revealing unlawful
 
00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:29.430 align:start position:0%
war on terror to revealing unlawful
surveillance

00:51:29.430 --> 00:51:29.440 align:start position:0%
surveillance
 
00:51:31.870 --> 00:51:31.880 align:start position:0%
practices and at the local level to give
 
00:51:34.789 --> 00:51:34.799 align:start position:0%
a recent example a lot of reporting on
 
00:51:37.030 --> 00:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
covid-19 which was crucial to getting
 
00:51:38.870 --> 00:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
accurate information to the public so
 
00:51:41.190 --> 00:51:41.200 align:start position:0%
they could adequately protect themselves
 
00:51:42.750 --> 00:51:42.760 align:start position:0%
would not have been possible without
 
00:51:44.950 --> 00:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
Healthcare entities being able to speak
 
00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
confidentially to trusted members of the
 
00:51:50.910 --> 00:51:50.920 align:start position:0%
media furthermore compelling journalists
 
00:51:52.750 --> 00:51:52.760 align:start position:0%
to disclose this information to assist
 
00:51:55.390 --> 00:51:55.400 align:start position:0%
law enforcement increases the likelihood
 
00:51:56.910 --> 00:51:56.920 align:start position:0%
that members of the public will perceive
 
00:51:58.670 --> 00:51:58.680 align:start position:0%
the press as an extension of law
 
00:52:01.829 --> 00:52:01.839 align:start position:0%
enforcement rather than as a neutral
 
00:52:05.030 --> 00:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
Observer last a single legal demand
 
00:52:06.470 --> 00:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
affects not just the work of the
 
00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:08.640 align:start position:0%
targeted journalist but all other
 
00:52:10.190 --> 00:52:10.200 align:start position:0%
journalists whose sources will hesitate
 
00:52:12.430 --> 00:52:12.440 align:start position:0%
and hold back information on significant
 
00:52:14.910 --> 00:52:14.920 align:start position:0%
matters of public concern if courts take
 
00:52:16.789 --> 00:52:16.799 align:start position:0%
up the invitation to scrutinize a
 
00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:18.720 align:start position:0%
reporter's news Gathering
 
00:52:21.309 --> 00:52:21.319 align:start position:0%
process in conclusion the reporters
 
00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
committee supports the passage of this
 
00:52:25.789 --> 00:52:25.799 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you
 
00:52:30.309 --> 00:52:30.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:35.349 --> 00:52:35.359 align:start position:0%
Fiddler seeing none oh representative
 
00:52:37.990 --> 00:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
Simpson sorry thank you this is not an
 
00:52:40.670 --> 00:52:40.680 align:start position:0%
area of expertise for me so my apolog
 
00:52:43.589 --> 00:52:43.599 align:start position:0%
apologies but I have a question if 39
 
00:52:45.470 --> 00:52:45.480 align:start position:0%
States is a lot of states and so I was
 
00:52:48.030 --> 00:52:48.040 align:start position:0%
just wondering if in those States these
 
00:52:50.670 --> 00:52:50.680 align:start position:0%
shield laws arose out of particular
 
00:52:52.750 --> 00:52:52.760 align:start position:0%
cases or if
 
00:52:55.829 --> 00:52:55.839 align:start position:0%
um or out of out of um
 
00:52:57.630 --> 00:52:57.640 align:start position:0%
I don't know fear is the right word but
 
00:53:01.349 --> 00:53:01.359 align:start position:0%
for not being able to do the job
 
00:53:03.230 --> 00:53:03.240 align:start position:0%
properly um that's a good question
 
00:53:04.670 --> 00:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
representative Simpson I believe it
 
00:53:06.309 --> 00:53:06.319 align:start position:0%
probably was a mixture um I'm not
 
00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
familiar sort of with the the Genesis of
 
00:53:11.430 --> 00:53:11.440 align:start position:0%
the laws in every one of these states um
 
00:53:13.589 --> 00:53:13.599 align:start position:0%
but certainly a mixture of principle and
 
00:53:15.390 --> 00:53:15.400 align:start position:0%
uh real danger and I should underscore
 
00:53:17.789 --> 00:53:17.799 align:start position:0%
it's not just a fear of journalists
 
00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
being jailed that motivates these laws
 
00:53:22.069 --> 00:53:22.079 align:start position:0%
um the mere fact of a subpoena can have
 
00:53:24.150 --> 00:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
a pretty significant chilling effect
 
00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:27.150 align:start position:0%
a pretty significant chilling effect
itself

00:53:27.150 --> 00:53:27.160 align:start position:0%
itself
 
00:53:27.160 --> 00:53:29.069 align:start position:0%
itself
representa

00:53:29.069 --> 00:53:29.079 align:start position:0%
representa
 
00:53:32.309 --> 00:53:32.319 align:start position:0%
bur uh thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:53:34.710 --> 00:53:34.720 align:start position:0%
Miss vidler or attorney fidler for
 
00:53:37.549 --> 00:53:37.559 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh I I want to be
 
00:53:41.589 --> 00:53:41.599 align:start position:0%
sure about your position are you saying
 
00:53:44.950 --> 00:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
that you Andor your organization
 
00:53:48.109 --> 00:53:48.119 align:start position:0%
supports this bill as it is written in
 
00:53:51.309 --> 00:53:51.319 align:start position:0%
its present form or are you saying you
 
00:53:55.190 --> 00:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
support the concept of the bill and uh
 
00:53:57.670 --> 00:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
depending on how it might be
 
00:53:59.870 --> 00:53:59.880 align:start position:0%
amended uh thank you for that question
 
00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
we do support the bill in its current
 
00:54:03.750 --> 00:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
form as representative Reed mentioned
 
00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
there are I believe 17 States who have
 
00:54:07.750 --> 00:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
similarly broad protections and it's
 
00:54:10.470 --> 00:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
been found to be fairly workable so um
 
00:54:12.430 --> 00:54:12.440 align:start position:0%
in terms of the definition of journalist
 
00:54:14.670 --> 00:54:14.680 align:start position:0%
we think strong subpoena protections
 
00:54:17.230 --> 00:54:17.240 align:start position:0%
should apply to anyone who's engaged in
 
00:54:19.270 --> 00:54:19.280 align:start position:0%
legitimate news Gathering so from our
 
00:54:20.910 --> 00:54:20.920 align:start position:0%
perspective this bill doesn't need to be
 
00:54:22.710 --> 00:54:22.720 align:start position:0%
amended there are ways that you could
 
00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
amend it and we would still support it
 
00:54:25.950 --> 00:54:25.960 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:54:25.960 --> 00:54:28.630 align:start position:0%
as well
thank

00:54:28.630 --> 00:54:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:31.069 --> 00:54:31.079 align:start position:0%
you I guess if I could just follow up on
 
00:54:32.789 --> 00:54:32.799 align:start position:0%
that you know being being an attorney
 
00:54:35.589 --> 00:54:35.599 align:start position:0%
I'm quite used to the idea of having
 
00:54:37.069 --> 00:54:37.079 align:start position:0%
attorney client
 
00:54:39.470 --> 00:54:39.480 align:start position:0%
privilege but there are certain
 
00:54:41.990 --> 00:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
exceptions to that so it's not an
 
00:54:45.190 --> 00:54:45.200 align:start position:0%
absolute privilege
 
00:54:48.030 --> 00:54:48.040 align:start position:0%
and this appears to be an it's a
 
00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
followup to represented burch's question
 
00:54:53.950 --> 00:54:53.960 align:start position:0%
really it this seems to be an absolute
 
00:54:55.990 --> 00:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
privilege uh
 
00:54:59.990 --> 00:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
um is it and I and I guess you've
 
00:55:01.589 --> 00:55:01.599 align:start position:0%
perhaps already answered the question is
 
00:55:03.549 --> 00:55:03.559 align:start position:0%
that is that the the
 
00:55:06.510 --> 00:55:06.520 align:start position:0%
typical typical manner uh that these are
 
00:55:09.109 --> 00:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
adopted in other states that it would be
 
00:55:11.870 --> 00:55:11.880 align:start position:0%
an absolute privilege not a not some
 
00:55:14.829 --> 00:55:14.839 align:start position:0%
type of balancing or not concerned with
 
00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
criminal activity Etc uh yes
 
00:55:19.589 --> 00:55:19.599 align:start position:0%
representative Gordon so the the best
 
00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
shield laws are um do provide this kind
 
00:55:24.029 --> 00:55:24.039 align:start position:0%
of absolute privilege and we've largely
 
00:55:26.309 --> 00:55:26.319 align:start position:0%
seen them to be workable
 
00:55:29.190 --> 00:55:29.200 align:start position:0%
um so I would recommend uh moving in the
 
00:55:30.589 --> 00:55:30.599 align:start position:0%
direction of an absolute privilege if
 
00:55:34.589 --> 00:55:34.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:38.549 --> 00:55:38.559 align:start position:0%
that thank you there any other
 
00:55:40.710 --> 00:55:40.720 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:43.950 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
testimony

00:55:43.950 --> 00:55:43.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:46.150 --> 00:55:46.160 align:start position:0%
today and is there anyone else who
 
00:55:49.309 --> 00:55:49.319 align:start position:0%
wishes to testify on
 
00:55:52.309 --> 00:55:52.319 align:start position:0%
453 if the if you do wish you need to
 
00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
raise your
 
00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:55.910 align:start position:0%
raise your
hand

00:55:55.910 --> 00:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
hand
 
00:55:57.990 --> 00:55:58.000 align:start position:0%
and I don't see anyone else who wishes
 
00:56:01.230 --> 00:56:01.240 align:start position:0%
to testify so we'll close the hearing on
 
00:56:07.870 --> 00:56:07.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:10.670 --> 00:56:10.680 align:start position:0%
4 leave us with about five minutes
 
00:56:13.910 --> 00:56:13.920 align:start position:0%

who signed up to in support of the bill
 
00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:28.870 align:start position:0%
 
opposition

00:56:28.870 --> 00:56:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:32.630 --> 00:56:32.640 align:start position:0%
for your information on House Bill
 
00:56:35.870 --> 00:56:35.880 align:start position:0%
133 there were 52 people who signed up
 
00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:53.880 --> 00:57:23.789 align:start position:0%
 
opposition

00:57:23.789 --> 00:57:23.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:23.799 --> 00:57:41.670 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:57:43.910 --> 00:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
the next bill that we'll be hearing is
 
00:57:46.510 --> 00:57:46.520 align:start position:0%
is House Bill 584 which I'll call to
 
00:57:51.390 --> 00:57:51.400 align:start position:0%
order at exactly 10 o'clock but just um
 
00:57:53.390 --> 00:57:53.400 align:start position:0%
in anticipation of that just to let you
 
00:57:56.430 --> 00:57:56.440 align:start position:0%
know that there were 13 people who
 
00:57:59.190 --> 00:57:59.200 align:start position:0%
signed up in opposition to House Bill
 
00:58:02.069 --> 00:58:02.079 align:start position:0%
584 and there were zero people who
 
00:58:23.710 --> 00:58:23.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:53.710 align:start position:0%
 
support

00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:53.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:53.720 --> 00:59:24.029 align:start position:0%

00:59:24.029 --> 00:59:24.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:29.230 --> 00:59:29.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:31.470 --> 00:59:31.480 align:start position:0%
relative to guilt by association and
 
00:59:33.789 --> 00:59:33.799 align:start position:0%
defamation by media
 
00:59:36.589 --> 00:59:36.599 align:start position:0%

I'm representative Horgan okay well

I'm I'm I'm here I'm home in my office

alone and um I'm not necessarily
 
01:00:28.430 --> 01:00:28.440 align:start position:0%
authorizing anything the bill says but I
 
01:00:31.789 --> 01:00:31.799 align:start position:0%
here to introduce HB 584 relative guilt
 
01:00:34.109 --> 01:00:34.119 align:start position:0%
and Association defamation by media
 
01:00:37.270 --> 01:00:37.280 align:start position:0%
outlets and um it appears that some you
 
01:00:39.670 --> 01:00:39.680 align:start position:0%
to require uh media Outlets here in New
 
01:00:42.990 --> 01:00:43.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to publish uh publish
 
01:00:45.710 --> 01:00:45.720 align:start position:0%
extensive updates on criminal cases and
 
01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
other controversies that they report on
 
01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
so that's a that's my understanding of
 
01:00:54.910 --> 01:00:54.920 align:start position:0%
the bill as I read it so I probably so I
 
01:00:56.069 --> 01:00:56.079 align:start position:0%
I guess I'll do the traditional thing
 
01:00:57.510 --> 01:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
and take any questions although I would
 
01:00:59.630 --> 01:00:59.640 align:start position:0%
probably be unable to answer any of them
 
01:01:02.309 --> 01:01:02.319 align:start position:0%
um so that's
 
01:01:05.430 --> 01:01:05.440 align:start position:0%
a and and I said I'm also then as I said
 
01:01:07.029 --> 01:01:07.039 align:start position:0%
I've also like formally acknowledged
 
01:01:09.270 --> 01:01:09.280 align:start position:0%
that I'm here home alone in my office
 
01:01:12.950 --> 01:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
etc etc so thank you well welcome and
 
01:01:15.630 --> 01:01:15.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for your introduction thank
 
01:01:18.750 --> 01:01:18.760 align:start position:0%

testify uh
 
01:01:27.069 --> 01:01:27.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:29.950 --> 01:01:29.960 align:start position:0%
and Quade would you like to

morning I hope everyone can hear me we
 
01:01:39.190 --> 01:01:39.200 align:start position:0%
can um yes my name is uh Brendan McQuade
 
01:01:40.710 --> 01:01:40.720 align:start position:0%
I'm president and publisher of the New
 
01:01:44.150 --> 01:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire union leader uh I am here on
 
01:01:45.750 --> 01:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
behalf of the New Hampshire press
 
01:01:48.910 --> 01:01:48.920 align:start position:0%
Association and we uh strongly opposed
 
01:01:53.190 --> 01:01:53.200 align:start position:0%
this bill um as I think uh anyone who
 
01:01:55.430 --> 01:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
actually reads the text of this bill
 
01:01:58.349 --> 01:01:58.359 align:start position:0%
would see this bill is patently
 
01:02:00.870 --> 01:02:00.880 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional um the idea that you
 
01:02:03.829 --> 01:02:03.839 align:start position:0%
can force media companies to print
 
01:02:06.990 --> 01:02:07.000 align:start position:0%
something uh has long been struck down
 
01:02:09.190 --> 01:02:09.200 align:start position:0%
in the history of this country and is
 
01:02:11.549 --> 01:02:11.559 align:start position:0%
anathema to both the First Amendment to
 
01:02:13.829 --> 01:02:13.839 align:start position:0%
the Constitution of the United States as
 
01:02:15.549 --> 01:02:15.559 align:start position:0%
well as to the New Hampshire
 
01:02:18.829 --> 01:02:18.839 align:start position:0%
Constitution um I would strongly suggest
 
01:02:22.390 --> 01:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
that members take a look at the
 
01:02:25.630 --> 01:02:25.640 align:start position:0%
provenance of this bill this seems to be
 
01:02:27.750 --> 01:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
an activist bill that has been
 
01:02:30.150 --> 01:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
introduced both in Mississippi and in
 
01:02:32.950 --> 01:02:32.960 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island and very quickly either
 
01:02:35.269 --> 01:02:35.279 align:start position:0%
voted down or actually withdrawn in both
 
01:02:38.990 --> 01:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
those places um because of its uh very
 
01:02:42.069 --> 01:02:42.079 align:start position:0%
nature there seems to be a guy who is uh
 
01:02:44.670 --> 01:02:44.680 align:start position:0%
quite against the media and has um tried
 
01:02:47.069 --> 01:02:47.079 align:start position:0%
to introduce this to punish the media
 
01:02:50.670 --> 01:02:50.680 align:start position:0%
for their uh transgressions against him
 
01:02:55.029 --> 01:02:55.039 align:start position:0%
anyway um the bill uh being uh
 
01:02:57.710 --> 01:02:57.720 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional uh sort of stands by
 
01:03:01.670 --> 01:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
itself um I will talk briefly about what
 
01:03:04.710 --> 01:03:04.720 align:start position:0%
I think uh people who see a bill like
 
01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
this would uh tend
 
01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:10.880 align:start position:0%
to understand as the as the reasoning
 
01:03:14.109 --> 01:03:14.119 align:start position:0%
behind it um and it's a it's a very real
 
01:03:16.990 --> 01:03:17.000 align:start position:0%
concern for people that are accused of
 
01:03:21.670 --> 01:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
crimes that they have a um uh an
 
01:03:24.950 --> 01:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
accusation against them comes a matter
 
01:03:27.589 --> 01:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
of public record the accusation goes out
 
01:03:29.710 --> 01:03:29.720 align:start position:0%
there the arrest record goes out there
 
01:03:31.589 --> 01:03:31.599 align:start position:0%
and for many people that is the end of
 
01:03:34.549 --> 01:03:34.559 align:start position:0%
it because a lot of these things um end
 
01:03:37.829 --> 01:03:37.839 align:start position:0%
in you know pre-trial they don't
 
01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
actually uh follow through so we as the
 
01:03:42.990 --> 01:03:43.000 align:start position:0%
Press don't get any follow-up
 
01:03:45.470 --> 01:03:45.480 align:start position:0%
information on these things unless we're
 
01:03:49.230 --> 01:03:49.240 align:start position:0%
notified about it and the union leader
 
01:03:51.789 --> 01:03:51.799 align:start position:0%
as well as all professional press uh you
 
01:03:54.150 --> 01:03:54.160 align:start position:0%
know members have a process that we go
 
01:03:56.390 --> 01:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
through through anytime we're contacted
 
01:03:58.390 --> 01:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
by someone who is affected by this type
 
01:04:02.109 --> 01:04:02.119 align:start position:0%
of thing we actually will uh take a look
 
01:04:04.630 --> 01:04:04.640 align:start position:0%
at what they submit to us and we will
 
01:04:06.269 --> 01:04:06.279 align:start position:0%
decide whether there's an update or a
 
01:04:08.470 --> 01:04:08.480 align:start position:0%
correction that should happen um
 
01:04:09.990 --> 01:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes there's a full-blown story
 
01:04:13.430 --> 01:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
that follows up to uh actually explain
 
01:04:16.470 --> 01:04:16.480 align:start position:0%
the outcome of a case
 
01:04:19.710 --> 01:04:19.720 align:start position:0%
um we're happy to listen to any
 
01:04:22.309 --> 01:04:22.319 align:start position:0%
suggestions that folks may have about
 
01:04:24.269 --> 01:04:24.279 align:start position:0%
that process about how we could do it
 
01:04:28.549 --> 01:04:28.559 align:start position:0%
better um I would strongly urge you to
 
01:04:31.269 --> 01:04:31.279 align:start position:0%
not consider this bill as a solution to
 
01:04:34.710 --> 01:04:34.720 align:start position:0%
that problem just read the bill um it is
 
01:04:37.510 --> 01:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
completely outrageous the way that it uh
 
01:04:40.789 --> 01:04:40.799 align:start position:0%
demands within 10 days that a a
 
01:04:43.309 --> 01:04:43.319 align:start position:0%
publication uh change what it has
 
01:04:47.309 --> 01:04:47.319 align:start position:0%
previously published uh the $110,000
 
01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:50.480 align:start position:0%
fines that it attempts to impose um as
 
01:04:53.069 --> 01:04:53.079 align:start position:0%
well as further damages beyond that uh
 
01:04:54.950 --> 01:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
the the chilling effect especially on
 
01:04:59.190 --> 01:04:59.200 align:start position:0%
smaller Outlets would be substantial
 
01:05:02.870 --> 01:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
um let's see uh sorry just trying to go
 
01:05:04.230 --> 01:05:04.240 align:start position:0%
through my notes make sure that I've
 
01:05:06.870 --> 01:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
covered everything
 
01:05:10.150 --> 01:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
um the the main concern here and I think
 
01:05:11.870 --> 01:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
it's important for the members to
 
01:05:14.150 --> 01:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
realize this we had a similar bill that
 
01:05:19.190 --> 01:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
came up uh last year um the problem here
 
01:05:22.309 --> 01:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
is not the local media the local media
 
01:05:23.789 --> 01:05:23.799 align:start position:0%
is who's going to be affected by this
 
01:05:23.799 --> 01:05:24.630 align:start position:0%
is who's going to be affected by this
bill

01:05:24.630 --> 01:05:24.640 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:05:28.390 --> 01:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
but the problem is Google and that's the
 
01:05:30.230 --> 01:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
that's the thing that everyone is
 
01:05:32.390 --> 01:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
frustrated by and that's what we hear
 
01:05:35.190 --> 01:05:35.200 align:start position:0%
most often is people call us and they
 
01:05:38.430 --> 01:05:38.440 align:start position:0%
say I Googled my name and your story
 
01:05:39.870 --> 01:05:39.880 align:start position:0%
about me came
 
01:05:44.470 --> 01:05:44.480 align:start position:0%
up unfortunately that's a Google problem
 
01:05:46.390 --> 01:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
more than it's an us problem I mean
 
01:05:49.309 --> 01:05:49.319 align:start position:0%
we've kept archives four years we didn't
 
01:05:51.430 --> 01:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
go back into the microfilm and white out
 
01:05:54.950 --> 01:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
the stuff that um you know changed
 
01:05:57.630 --> 01:05:57.640 align:start position:0%
Google makes it so easy to delve back
 
01:06:00.710 --> 01:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
into these records that uh it really
 
01:06:03.630 --> 01:06:03.640 align:start position:0%
does become a problem for people that um
 
01:06:06.990 --> 01:06:07.000 align:start position:0%
their Digital Life when you look at
 
01:06:09.589 --> 01:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
Google often becomes their most
 
01:06:11.910 --> 01:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
prominent thing which sometimes is an
 
01:06:14.589 --> 01:06:14.599 align:start position:0%
arrest that does not look very favorable
 
01:06:16.829 --> 01:06:16.839 align:start position:0%
upon them um so that's why we do
 
01:06:19.269 --> 01:06:19.279 align:start position:0%
everything we can to update to put the
 
01:06:21.309 --> 01:06:21.319 align:start position:0%
disposition of a case if we have
 
01:06:23.390 --> 01:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate records for that so that
 
01:06:25.670 --> 01:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
people have a full understanding of the
 
01:06:28.190 --> 01:06:28.200 align:start position:0%
picture but again this is not the way to
 
01:06:30.870 --> 01:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
do it if you look at it it actually says
 
01:06:34.349 --> 01:06:34.359 align:start position:0%
that U we can no longer run the mug shot
 
01:06:37.150 --> 01:06:37.160 align:start position:0%
if if we have uh a mug shot of the
 
01:06:39.349 --> 01:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
person if there's a you know further
 
01:06:41.710 --> 01:06:41.720 align:start position:0%
disposition of the case well sometimes
 
01:06:43.789 --> 01:06:43.799 align:start position:0%
the mug shot is the story we had a case
 
01:06:46.430 --> 01:06:46.440 align:start position:0%
in Manchester where the guy's mug shot
 
01:06:49.309 --> 01:06:49.319 align:start position:0%
actually showed that he was roughed up
 
01:06:51.750 --> 01:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
by some folks during the course of an
 
01:06:54.230 --> 01:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
arrest and that became the story if we
 
01:06:56.309 --> 01:06:56.319 align:start position:0%
could no longer run that mug shot it
 
01:06:58.510 --> 01:06:58.520 align:start position:0%
would just be ridiculous we wouldn't be
 
01:07:01.269 --> 01:07:01.279 align:start position:0%
able to tell that story anymore so um I
 
01:07:04.549 --> 01:07:04.559 align:start position:0%
urge the members to consider this bill
 
01:07:08.349 --> 01:07:08.359 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate as it is and um
 
01:07:10.589 --> 01:07:10.599 align:start position:0%
I hope you will uh listen to uh the
 
01:07:12.789 --> 01:07:12.799 align:start position:0%
further folks I think there are probably
 
01:07:14.910 --> 01:07:14.920 align:start position:0%
some legal experts who can give you some
 
01:07:17.670 --> 01:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
more of the background on the history
 
01:07:19.950 --> 01:07:19.960 align:start position:0%
and the legality of bills such as this
 
01:07:22.029 --> 01:07:22.039 align:start position:0%
but um I'm happy to answer any questions
 
01:07:24.990 --> 01:07:25.000 align:start position:0%
as it relates to the Press
 
01:07:27.349 --> 01:07:27.359 align:start position:0%
are there questions from M MC yes
 
01:07:27.359 --> 01:07:28.630 align:start position:0%
are there questions from M MC yes
representative

01:07:28.630 --> 01:07:28.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:07:31.750 --> 01:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
Simpson hi thank you I think this is a
 
01:07:33.150 --> 01:07:33.160 align:start position:0%
simple question I just don't know the
 
01:07:36.870 --> 01:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
answer to um when you rerun a followup
 
01:07:39.190 --> 01:07:39.200 align:start position:0%
if there is one to rerun do you rerun
 
01:07:42.510 --> 01:07:42.520 align:start position:0%
the mug shot with it or do you um have
 
01:07:44.990 --> 01:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
another picture that you rerun with the
 
01:07:48.069 --> 01:07:48.079 align:start position:0%
saying that maybe uh a person was found
 
01:07:49.950 --> 01:07:49.960 align:start position:0%
not guilty or something like this do you
 
01:07:51.990 --> 01:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
rerun the mug shot or or seek to find a
 
01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
different picture that's not um so it
 
01:07:57.630 --> 01:07:57.640 align:start position:0%
depends on the story usually we will
 
01:08:00.990 --> 01:08:01.000 align:start position:0%
update the story as it exists so story
 
01:08:03.789 --> 01:08:03.799 align:start position:0%
is a snapshot in time right newspapers
 
01:08:05.349 --> 01:08:05.359 align:start position:0%
are often considered the first draft of
 
01:08:07.470 --> 01:08:07.480 align:start position:0%
history and that's where we like to keep
 
01:08:09.910 --> 01:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
it so we will actually update that same
 
01:08:11.589 --> 01:08:11.599 align:start position:0%
story so if there was a mug shot with
 
01:08:13.589 --> 01:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
that story it will often stay with that
 
01:08:16.990 --> 01:08:17.000 align:start position:0%
original story with a a header or an
 
01:08:20.590 --> 01:08:20.600 align:start position:0%
update um on the story to let people
 
01:08:22.030 --> 01:08:22.040 align:start position:0%
know that there actually has been a
 
01:08:24.669 --> 01:08:24.679 align:start position:0%
disposition to the case
 
01:08:28.229 --> 01:08:28.239 align:start position:0%
but if if there's a if there's a um uh
 
01:08:30.070 --> 01:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
if there's a a trial that we're
 
01:08:31.590 --> 01:08:31.600 align:start position:0%
following that we're actually you know
 
01:08:33.269 --> 01:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
allowed to be in the courtroom yeah
 
01:08:35.470 --> 01:08:35.480 align:start position:0%
we'll usually run a picture from that
 
01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:42.950 --> 01:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:46.149 --> 01:08:46.159 align:start position:0%
Chase thank you very much Mr chair and
 
01:08:49.789 --> 01:08:49.799 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question Brendan
 
01:08:54.149 --> 01:08:54.159 align:start position:0%
um it when something is done incorrectly
 
01:08:56.870 --> 01:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
a story isn't written correctly or more
 
01:08:58.910 --> 01:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
information comes forward and I know
 
01:09:01.630 --> 01:09:01.640 align:start position:0%
that a lot of media will just put in a
 
01:09:04.349 --> 01:09:04.359 align:start position:0%
little blurb saying in last week's
 
01:09:06.590 --> 01:09:06.600 align:start position:0%
column so and so was said and this was
 
01:09:09.030 --> 01:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
not correct do you when that's done is
 
01:09:10.390 --> 01:09:10.400 align:start position:0%
it is it
 
01:09:13.229 --> 01:09:13.239 align:start position:0%
attached I'll say online or in some type
 
01:09:16.829 --> 01:09:16.839 align:start position:0%
of a media situation to the um the
 
01:09:20.189 --> 01:09:20.199 align:start position:0%
original article so that that also comes
 
01:09:22.510 --> 01:09:22.520 align:start position:0%
up immediately when somebody searches
 
01:09:25.229 --> 01:09:25.239 align:start position:0%
would that help with this
 
01:09:28.829 --> 01:09:28.839 align:start position:0%
so online yes that th those Corrections
 
01:09:32.669 --> 01:09:32.679 align:start position:0%
tend to get made to the online story um
 
01:09:35.390 --> 01:09:35.400 align:start position:0%
that's the way that that works in print
 
01:09:38.789 --> 01:09:38.799 align:start position:0%
you actually um you know it's it's just
 
01:09:40.590 --> 01:09:40.600 align:start position:0%
a practical matter you don't want to
 
01:09:43.870 --> 01:09:43.880 align:start position:0%
repeat the mistake in a correction so
 
01:09:46.110 --> 01:09:46.120 align:start position:0%
you actually print what the factual
 
01:09:48.149 --> 01:09:48.159 align:start position:0%
information should have been you don't
 
01:09:51.189 --> 01:09:51.199 align:start position:0%
repeat the same mistake so you would
 
01:09:53.749 --> 01:09:53.759 align:start position:0%
cause further confusion to the reader
 
01:09:55.590 --> 01:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
01:10:00.189 --> 01:10:00.199 align:start position:0%
much any other questions for Mr
 
01:10:02.950 --> 01:10:02.960 align:start position:0%
mcade see thank you for your testimony
 
01:10:06.790 --> 01:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:21.070 --> 01:10:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:23.149 --> 01:10:23.159 align:start position:0%

01:10:27.830 --> 01:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
morning Mr chairman members of the
 
01:10:29.950 --> 01:10:29.960 align:start position:0%
committee uh thank you for allowing me
 
01:10:32.430 --> 01:10:32.440 align:start position:0%
to testify my name is Gregory Sullivan
 
01:10:34.910 --> 01:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
I'm an attorney a represent Union Leader
 
01:10:37.070 --> 01:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
Corporation and the New England First
 
01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:38.310 align:start position:0%
Corporation and the New England First
Amendment

01:10:38.310 --> 01:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
01:10:42.070 --> 01:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
Coalition um as Mr McQuay just
 
01:10:46.110 --> 01:10:46.120 align:start position:0%
testified this bill is blatantly
 
01:10:48.590 --> 01:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional it's black letter law
 
01:10:51.350 --> 01:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
in the United States and I'll talk
 
01:10:53.990 --> 01:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
quickly about the case of Miami heral
 
01:10:56.830 --> 01:10:56.840 align:start position:0%
versus uh
 
01:10:59.550 --> 01:10:59.560 align:start position:0%
orello um and I'm going to just give
 
01:11:02.310 --> 01:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
three quotes from that case which was
 
01:11:03.870 --> 01:11:03.880 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court of the United States
 
01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:05.229 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court of the United States
in

01:11:05.229 --> 01:11:05.239 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:11:08.310 --> 01:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
1974 it says dictating what a newspaper
 
01:11:10.709 --> 01:11:10.719 align:start position:0%
must print is no different from
 
01:11:14.669 --> 01:11:14.679 align:start position:0%
dictating what it must not
 
01:11:17.910 --> 01:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
print press responsibility cannot be
 
01:11:20.270 --> 01:11:20.280 align:start position:0%
mandated by
 
01:11:23.590 --> 01:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
legislation and thirdly there can be no
 
01:11:26.630 --> 01:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
intrusion into the function of
 
01:11:29.709 --> 01:11:29.719 align:start position:0%
editors I mean that's the law and this
 
01:11:33.630 --> 01:11:33.640 align:start position:0%
bill is just lies directly in the face
 
01:11:36.270 --> 01:11:36.280 align:start position:0%
of that law clearly I'd point out it's
 
01:11:38.350 --> 01:11:38.360 align:start position:0%
not just criminal cases that this this
 
01:11:40.470 --> 01:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
bill addresses either it's civil cases
 
01:11:42.510 --> 01:11:42.520 align:start position:0%
so under this bill if someone sues for a
 
01:11:45.550 --> 01:11:45.560 align:start position:0%
million dollars and they get a dollar or
 
01:11:46.790 --> 01:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
they get
 
01:11:49.790 --> 01:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
999,000 whatever it is the newspaper is
 
01:11:53.110 --> 01:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
mandated to run a follow-up story and
 
01:11:55.030 --> 01:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
not only is it unconstitutional it's
 
01:11:57.550 --> 01:11:57.560 align:start position:0%
completely impracticable for the press
 
01:12:01.550 --> 01:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
to be able to track every single civil
 
01:12:03.750 --> 01:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
criminal administrative case that that
 
01:12:08.189 --> 01:12:08.199 align:start position:0%
happens in the state um in in the law we
 
01:12:10.629 --> 01:12:10.639 align:start position:0%
have a phrase void for vagueness there
 
01:12:13.990 --> 01:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
are so many provisions of this bill that
 
01:12:16.510 --> 01:12:16.520 align:start position:0%
would be subject to anyone's differing
 
01:12:19.390 --> 01:12:19.400 align:start position:0%
interpretation that it it clearly is
 
01:12:20.510 --> 01:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
void for
 
01:12:24.310 --> 01:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
vagueness um so I'm not gonna take up
 
01:12:26.510 --> 01:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
too much of your time but I will point
 
01:12:29.390 --> 01:12:29.400 align:start position:0%
out that part one article 22 of the New
 
01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:30.950 align:start position:0%
out that part one article 22 of the New
Hampshire

01:12:30.950 --> 01:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:12:34.110 --> 01:12:34.120 align:start position:0%
Constitution uh is even stronger in its
 
01:12:37.070 --> 01:12:37.080 align:start position:0%
protection of the Free Press than the
 
01:12:41.350 --> 01:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
first amendment is uh it says that the
 
01:12:44.510 --> 01:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
Free Press and and Free Speech are in uh
 
01:12:46.629 --> 01:12:46.639 align:start position:0%
essential to the security of freedom in
 
01:12:48.709 --> 01:12:48.719 align:start position:0%
the state and therefore must be
 
01:12:52.910 --> 01:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
inviolably preserved well this bill uh
 
01:12:56.709 --> 01:12:56.719 align:start position:0%
does not in any way uh inv viably
 
01:12:58.390 --> 01:12:58.400 align:start position:0%
preserve the freedom of the press it
 
01:13:02.189 --> 01:13:02.199 align:start position:0%
does just the opposite and I'll be glad
 
01:13:04.750 --> 01:13:04.760 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions I I'll State as
 
01:13:07.270 --> 01:13:07.280 align:start position:0%
Mr McQuade did now I've been
 
01:13:09.070 --> 01:13:09.080 align:start position:0%
representing the union leader for over
 
01:13:12.030 --> 01:13:12.040 align:start position:0%
40 years something I'm hesitant to
 
01:13:16.470 --> 01:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
admit uh but there was no Google uh back
 
01:13:19.590 --> 01:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
in the day and from then to now Union
 
01:13:22.629 --> 01:13:22.639 align:start position:0%
Leader has done everything it possibly
 
01:13:24.510 --> 01:13:24.520 align:start position:0%
can and many other Professional
 
01:13:28.229 --> 01:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
Publications of the same way to rectify
 
01:13:31.629 --> 01:13:31.639 align:start position:0%
errors um because as as the banner head
 
01:13:33.350 --> 01:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
of the union leader says there's nothing
 
01:13:36.310 --> 01:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
so powerful as truth and that is indeed
 
01:13:38.830 --> 01:13:38.840 align:start position:0%
what the union leader seeks to publish
 
01:13:41.950 --> 01:13:41.960 align:start position:0%
day in and day out and now even on
 
01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:43.030 align:start position:0%
day in and day out and now even on

England states and its uh executive
 
01:14:00.030 --> 01:14:00.040 align:start position:0%
committee has instructed me to speak as
 
01:14:02.149 --> 01:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
vehemently as I can in opposition to
 
01:14:04.629 --> 01:14:04.639 align:start position:0%
this bill and ask you to deem it
 
01:14:06.229 --> 01:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to
 
01:14:08.270 --> 01:14:08.280 align:start position:0%
legislate be glad to answer any
 
01:14:11.030 --> 01:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
questions you may have thank you
 
01:14:13.830 --> 01:14:13.840 align:start position:0%
attorney Sullivan representative D
 
01:14:16.390 --> 01:14:16.400 align:start position:0%
Lorenzo thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:14:19.149 --> 01:14:19.159 align:start position:0%
Mr Sullivan for taking my question so in
 
01:14:21.189 --> 01:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
your opinion would you say that this
 
01:14:24.229 --> 01:14:24.239 align:start position:0%
bill has no redeeming Merit
 
01:14:27.110 --> 01:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
you know I I think the motivation behind
 
01:14:30.229 --> 01:14:30.239 align:start position:0%
the bill is understandable um I've
 
01:14:32.350 --> 01:14:32.360 align:start position:0%
represented clients who felt that they
 
01:14:36.350 --> 01:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
were unfairly treated by the Press but
 
01:14:38.470 --> 01:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
what I've done is is is called the
 
01:14:41.709 --> 01:14:41.719 align:start position:0%
editor of publisher of the newspaper not
 
01:14:43.350 --> 01:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
the local state
 
01:14:45.270 --> 01:14:45.280 align:start position:0%
representative um so I think the
 
01:14:48.030 --> 01:14:48.040 align:start position:0%
motivation as Brenda McQuade said is is
 
01:14:49.910 --> 01:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
understandable there are problems that
 
01:14:53.350 --> 01:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
occur but it's up to the press to uh
 
01:14:55.350 --> 01:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
take care of those problems as best they
 
01:14:57.709 --> 01:14:57.719 align:start position:0%
can and the press that I'm familiar with
 
01:15:01.669 --> 01:15:01.679 align:start position:0%
do it every day thank you may I follow
 
01:15:04.470 --> 01:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
up you may
 
01:15:08.830 --> 01:15:08.840 align:start position:0%
um so have you Mr uh Sullivan have you
 
01:15:11.910 --> 01:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
heard of any other states that are
 
01:15:13.950 --> 01:15:13.960 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
01:15:17.390 --> 01:15:17.400 align:start position:0%
um project this
 
01:15:20.149 --> 01:15:20.159 align:start position:0%
legislation only the two that Mr mcade
 
01:15:22.950 --> 01:15:22.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned which were immediately knocked
 
01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:23.910 align:start position:0%
mentioned which were immediately knocked
down

01:15:23.910 --> 01:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
down
 
01:15:26.430 --> 01:15:26.440 align:start position:0%
there there's similar legal concepts for
 
01:15:28.990 --> 01:15:29.000 align:start position:0%
example the right to reply for a
 
01:15:33.430 --> 01:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
political candidate um and those efforts
 
01:15:36.550 --> 01:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
to mandate the Press giving equal time
 
01:15:39.510 --> 01:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
to various candidates have been stricken
 
01:15:42.030 --> 01:15:42.040 align:start position:0%
for the same reasons uh we've discussed
 
01:15:44.229 --> 01:15:44.239 align:start position:0%
and were dealt with in the Miami Herald
 
01:15:46.990 --> 01:15:47.000 align:start position:0%
case back in
 
01:15:51.110 --> 01:15:51.120 align:start position:0%

01:16:06.110 --> 01:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
there anyone else in attendance today
 
01:16:13.750 --> 01:16:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:17.669 --> 01:16:17.679 align:start position:0%
584 I see no one with a hand raised so I
 
01:16:22.110 --> 01:16:22.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:26.430 --> 01:16:26.440 align:start position:0%
584 and we're not scheduled to
 
01:16:32.310 --> 01:16:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:35.189 --> 01:16:35.199 align:start position:0%
I to have another hearing until 11
 
01:16:38.030 --> 01:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
o'clock so I think the best thing to do
 
01:16:40.830 --> 01:16:40.840 align:start position:0%
is to recess until 11 o'clock and we do
 
01:16:44.149 --> 01:16:44.159 align:start position:0%
have a bill at that time which will have
 
01:16:46.470 --> 01:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
a number of
 
01:16:49.430 --> 01:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
speakers and sponsored by one of our
 
01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:50.669 align:start position:0%
speakers and sponsored by one of our
committee

01:16:50.669 --> 01:16:50.679 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:16:54.550 --> 01:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
mates okay we'll see you at 11 oh M
 
01:16:56.030 --> 01:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
excuse me representative
 
01:16:59.470 --> 01:16:59.480 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you very much um Mr chair
 
01:17:02.070 --> 01:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
first of all I think you own no one an
 
01:17:06.110 --> 01:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
apology for trying to guess in advance
 
01:17:08.070 --> 01:17:08.080 align:start position:0%
the amount of time you need for each
 
01:17:12.510 --> 01:17:12.520 align:start position:0%
bill this is not an exact science and
 
01:17:16.350 --> 01:17:16.360 align:start position:0%
you've done very well um my other point
 
01:17:22.110 --> 01:17:22.120 align:start position:0%
is um I gased when I saw the Tuesday
 
01:17:25.629 --> 01:17:25.639 align:start position:0%
schedule and the number of bills that we
 
01:17:26.790 --> 01:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
have to
 
01:17:29.310 --> 01:17:29.320 align:start position:0%
exec and
 
01:17:33.030 --> 01:17:33.040 align:start position:0%
um worry about the proverbial throwing
 
01:17:35.229 --> 01:17:35.239 align:start position:0%
out of the baby with the bath water if
 
01:17:38.110 --> 01:17:38.120 align:start position:0%
we don't really have time to focus on
 
01:17:39.750 --> 01:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
the bills where we can make a
 
01:17:42.350 --> 01:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
significant contribution so my question
 
01:17:44.990 --> 01:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
is are there any
 
01:17:49.310 --> 01:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
bills now that you
 
01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable
 
01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.830 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable
enough

01:17:53.830 --> 01:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
enough
 
01:17:59.709 --> 01:17:59.719 align:start position:0%
with to perhaps have us um exec and I'm
 
01:18:02.310 --> 01:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
not second guessing you I'm not I don't
 
01:18:03.990 --> 01:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
even know if there are any I'm just
 
01:18:06.110 --> 01:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
raising it as a possibility since we
 
01:18:07.990 --> 01:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
have 45
 
01:18:09.990 --> 01:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
minutes just
 
01:18:14.310 --> 01:18:14.320 align:start position:0%
one uh unfortunately there there are
 
01:18:15.950 --> 01:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
first of all it's unfortunate that we
 
01:18:18.750 --> 01:18:18.760 align:start position:0%
have to meet on Fridays at all but it's
 
01:18:20.590 --> 01:18:20.600 align:start position:0%
just our schedule has brought us to a
 
01:18:22.590 --> 01:18:22.600 align:start position:0%
point where we need to do that with a
 
01:18:24.629 --> 01:18:24.639 align:start position:0%
number of bills that we have but there
 
01:18:26.629 --> 01:18:26.639 align:start position:0%
are people who just can't make it
 
01:18:28.990 --> 01:18:29.000 align:start position:0%
because they have conflicts on Friday
 
01:18:31.310 --> 01:18:31.320 align:start position:0%
and that's why I put the exec session on
 
01:18:33.550 --> 01:18:33.560 align:start position:0%
Tuesday when I think people ordinarily
 
01:18:38.270 --> 01:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
would expect to be here so um but I've
 
01:18:40.590 --> 01:18:40.600 align:start position:0%
told people since they can't be here I'm
 
01:18:43.270 --> 01:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
not going to exec bills so I really
 
01:18:46.070 --> 01:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
don't feel I can do that thank you very
 
01:18:48.910 --> 01:18:48.920 align:start position:0%
much but what what I what I am hoping
 
01:18:50.990 --> 01:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
and what I would uh what I was
 
01:18:52.950 --> 01:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
anticipating telling everybody is what I
 
01:18:55.189 --> 01:18:55.199 align:start position:0%
I hope people will do is go through the
 
01:18:58.830 --> 01:18:58.840 align:start position:0%
bills in anticipation of new day with
 
01:19:01.350 --> 01:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
the idea that they have an understanding
 
01:19:04.510 --> 01:19:04.520 align:start position:0%
of what they uh would like to exec and I
 
01:19:06.310 --> 01:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
certainly am going to do that in advance
 
01:19:08.110 --> 01:19:08.120 align:start position:0%
and try to provide as much leadership as
 
01:19:10.629 --> 01:19:10.639 align:start position:0%
I can because there are some bills
 
01:19:12.510 --> 01:19:12.520 align:start position:0%
perhaps even the last bill that we heard
 
01:19:15.550 --> 01:19:15.560 align:start position:0%
that might be obvious in terms of an
 
01:19:18.510 --> 01:19:18.520 align:start position:0%
outcome and and try to get those
 
01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
addressed and get them done quickly and
 
01:19:24.669 --> 01:19:24.679 align:start position:0%
go through as many bills as we can but
 
01:19:27.189 --> 01:19:27.199 align:start position:0%
I'm with you I don't want to rush
 
01:19:29.669 --> 01:19:29.679 align:start position:0%
through bills and and produce a bad
 
01:19:31.990 --> 01:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
product because that that serves
 
01:19:34.470 --> 01:19:34.480 align:start position:0%
nobody's interest I think so we'll do as
 
01:19:36.510 --> 01:19:36.520 align:start position:0%
much as we can on
 
01:19:40.110 --> 01:19:40.120 align:start position:0%
Tuesday thank you Mr chair and then uh
 
01:19:42.390 --> 01:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
we'll do if if we have to carry stuff
 
01:19:44.830 --> 01:19:44.840 align:start position:0%
over to the following week till the 10th
 
01:19:48.510 --> 01:19:48.520 align:start position:0%
then we'll do that uh and but we need to
 
01:19:50.470 --> 01:19:50.480 align:start position:0%
get everything done on the 10th you know
 
01:19:52.629 --> 01:19:52.639 align:start position:0%
if if we can't get it done on the 10th
 
01:19:54.709 --> 01:19:54.719 align:start position:0%
we could always recess and do it on the
 
01:19:57.270 --> 01:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
11th but I but everything has to be out
 
01:19:58.910 --> 01:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
on the 11th and I'd rather get it done
 
01:20:00.830 --> 01:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
on the 10th so we can get the reports
 
01:20:03.510 --> 01:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:05.550 --> 01:20:05.560 align:start position:0%
everything then is
 
01:20:08.390 --> 01:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
syvia uh thank you Mr chair um I have a
 
01:20:12.510 --> 01:20:12.520 align:start position:0%
question uh regarding procedures um at
 
01:20:15.950 --> 01:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
one o'clock we have HB 440 for which I
 
01:20:19.229 --> 01:20:19.239 align:start position:0%
have a an amendment y essentially
 
01:20:23.510 --> 01:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
replacing the bill as far as uh
 
01:20:26.229 --> 01:20:26.239 align:start position:0%
if we were in committee
 
01:20:26.239 --> 01:20:28.229 align:start position:0%
if we were in committee
um

01:20:28.229 --> 01:20:28.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:32.070 --> 01:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
uh ordinarily if I were a co-sponsor on
 
01:20:34.910 --> 01:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
a bill I would not be uh able to ask
 
01:20:37.470 --> 01:20:37.480 align:start position:0%
questions am I what is what what would
 
01:20:40.149 --> 01:20:40.159 align:start position:0%
be my situation as the sponsor of the
 
01:20:41.870 --> 01:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
amendment which essentially is becoming
 
01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:42.910 align:start position:0%
amendment which essentially is becoming
the

01:20:42.910 --> 01:20:42.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:20:46.149 --> 01:20:46.159 align:start position:0%
bill it's becoming the bill I would I
 
01:20:48.270 --> 01:20:48.280 align:start position:0%
would think that you
 
01:20:52.470 --> 01:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
would uh that you would testify but then
 
01:20:55.070 --> 01:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
not participate in the question and
 
01:20:55.080 --> 01:20:56.950 align:start position:0%
not participate in the question and
answer

01:20:56.950 --> 01:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
answer
 
01:21:01.990 --> 01:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
portion okay great appreciate
 
01:21:05.310 --> 01:21:05.320 align:start position:0%
it representative Corgan um well well
 
01:21:07.470 --> 01:21:07.480 align:start position:0%
first of all I apologize for being late
 
01:21:09.870 --> 01:21:09.880 align:start position:0%
at straford county executive committee
 
01:21:12.470 --> 01:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
actually an issue am I muted and an
 
01:21:14.270 --> 01:21:14.280 align:start position:0%
issue that came up there we were G to
 
01:21:16.470 --> 01:21:16.480 align:start position:0%
have the full delegation meet on town
 
01:21:19.590 --> 01:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
meeting day which is the 10th so that uh
 
01:21:21.110 --> 01:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
we be meeting in the morning or the
 
01:21:23.310 --> 01:21:23.320 align:start position:0%
afternoon on the 10th but that's
 
01:21:26.629 --> 01:21:26.639 align:start position:0%
scheduling factor to consider um so just
 
01:21:28.990 --> 01:21:29.000 align:start position:0%
thought to bring up those two points as
 
01:21:31.470 --> 01:21:31.480 align:start position:0%
for 440 I guess technically the
 
01:21:33.950 --> 01:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
amendment doesn't become the bill until
 
01:21:36.430 --> 01:21:36.440 align:start position:0%
we accept it in executive session which
 
01:21:38.950 --> 01:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
may or may not happen but I thank
 
01:21:40.750 --> 01:21:40.760 align:start position:0%
represent Sylvia for expressing his
 
01:21:45.229 --> 01:21:45.239 align:start position:0%
concern so and so that's what that's
 
01:21:46.870 --> 01:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
what I had to say so
 
01:21:50.790 --> 01:21:50.800 align:start position:0%
um I think town meeting I I think town
 
01:21:53.110 --> 01:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
meeting day is the ninth if I'm not
 
01:21:56.270 --> 01:21:56.280 align:start position:0%
Tuesday the 9th okay maybe oh I know
 
01:21:59.110 --> 01:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
maybe that may have a okay you're right
 
01:22:01.189 --> 01:22:01.199 align:start position:0%
of course I'm sorry I think that arose
 
01:22:03.390 --> 01:22:03.400 align:start position:0%
because one of the members of our one of
 
01:22:05.790 --> 01:22:05.800 align:start position:0%
our towns is having rescheduled their
 
01:22:08.149 --> 01:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
deliberative session for the 10th or
 
01:22:11.229 --> 01:22:11.239 align:start position:0%
anyway my apologies so that's
 
01:22:13.790 --> 01:22:13.800 align:start position:0%
uh not a problem we we ordinarily would
 
01:22:15.470 --> 01:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
meet on the nth but because this time
 
01:22:17.390 --> 01:22:17.400 align:start position:0%
day we can't meet as a commit that's why
 
01:22:19.669 --> 01:22:19.679 align:start position:0%
we scheduled the meeting oh perfect yes
 
01:22:21.550 --> 01:22:21.560 align:start position:0%
that makes
 
01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:23.350 align:start position:0%
that makes
sense

01:22:23.350 --> 01:22:23.360 align:start position:0%
sense
 
01:22:25.430 --> 01:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
sovia did you have another
 
01:22:27.709 --> 01:22:27.719 align:start position:0%
question no I was trying to figure out
 
01:22:30.189 --> 01:22:30.199 align:start position:0%
how to put my hand down in the
 
01:22:33.270 --> 01:22:33.280 align:start position:0%
no I am now home in Belmont so I'm gonna
 
01:22:35.390 --> 01:22:35.400 align:start position:0%

18 and I'm also a member of this
 
02:00:19.470 --> 02:00:19.480 align:start position:0%
respected committee HB 540 would create
 
02:00:21.870 --> 02:00:21.880 align:start position:0%
an alternative to guardianship for
 
02:00:23.589 --> 02:00:23.599 align:start position:0%
adults with disabilities and their
 
02:00:26.270 --> 02:00:26.280 align:start position:0%
families who wish to establish a way of
 
02:00:29.709 --> 02:00:29.719 align:start position:0%
providing support without taking away
 
02:00:31.870 --> 02:00:31.880 align:start position:0%
self-determination under the current law
 
02:00:33.910 --> 02:00:33.920 align:start position:0%
there are very few options when a family
 
02:00:35.950 --> 02:00:35.960 align:start position:0%
is looking for a way to provide support
 
02:00:38.669 --> 02:00:38.679 align:start position:0%
to their loved ones with a disability
 
02:00:41.390 --> 02:00:41.400 align:start position:0%
this issue often comes up when a young
 
02:00:43.589 --> 02:00:43.599 align:start position:0%
person is about to turn 18 and the
 
02:00:46.589 --> 02:00:46.599 align:start position:0%
family wants to continue supportive role
 
02:00:49.870 --> 02:00:49.880 align:start position:0%
in the areas like Education Health Care
 
02:00:53.069 --> 02:00:53.079 align:start position:0%
and public funded services but right now
 
02:00:55.030 --> 02:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
there are no recognized meaningful
 
02:00:56.910 --> 02:00:56.920 align:start position:0%
alternatives to guardianship which
 
02:00:59.030 --> 02:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
involves the removal of decision-making
 
02:01:01.350 --> 02:01:01.360 align:start position:0%
powers from the person and it gives it
 
02:01:04.350 --> 02:01:04.360 align:start position:0%
to the guardian appointed by the court
 
02:01:06.430 --> 02:01:06.440 align:start position:0%
the power of attorney can be used for
 
02:01:09.669 --> 02:01:09.679 align:start position:0%
financial and Health Care decisions but
 
02:01:12.470 --> 02:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
these Alternatives typically involved
 
02:01:14.750 --> 02:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
the full takeover of the decision for
 
02:01:17.189 --> 02:01:17.199 align:start position:0%
someone and they are often only
 
02:01:18.629 --> 02:01:18.639 align:start position:0%
available when someone becomes
 
02:01:21.870 --> 02:01:21.880 align:start position:0%
completely unable to make a decision for
 
02:01:24.350 --> 02:01:24.360 align:start position:0%
themselves 540 would
 
02:01:27.750 --> 02:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
create a legal recognized alternative so
 
02:01:30.390 --> 02:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
that people in a range of circumstances
 
02:01:32.669 --> 02:01:32.679 align:start position:0%
can be provided the support they need
 
02:01:34.550 --> 02:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
without the court removing their freedom
 
02:01:37.350 --> 02:01:37.360 align:start position:0%
of choice when this is unnecessary to
 
02:01:39.830 --> 02:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
meet their needs people with
 
02:01:43.270 --> 02:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
disabilities often simply need what we
 
02:01:46.669 --> 02:01:46.679 align:start position:0%
all utilize from time to time we need
 
02:01:49.750 --> 02:01:49.760 align:start position:0%
support at various stages of our life in
 
02:01:52.830 --> 02:01:52.840 align:start position:0%
various subject areas most of you on the
 
02:01:54.669 --> 02:01:54.679 align:start position:0%
committee may look for help in
 
02:01:56.229 --> 02:01:56.239 align:start position:0%
understanding important complex
 
02:01:58.030 --> 02:01:58.040 align:start position:0%
information when making important
 
02:02:01.350 --> 02:02:01.360 align:start position:0%
financial decisions for example or you
 
02:02:03.270 --> 02:02:03.280 align:start position:0%
might seek advice from trusted friends
 
02:02:06.550 --> 02:02:06.560 align:start position:0%
and relatives when facing challenges or
 
02:02:11.550 --> 02:02:11.560 align:start position:0%
M M yeah momentous excuse me decisions
 
02:02:13.709 --> 02:02:13.719 align:start position:0%
involving your health this bill
 
02:02:16.229 --> 02:02:16.239 align:start position:0%
recognize the reality and it makes that
 
02:02:19.069 --> 02:02:19.079 align:start position:0%
kind of support formally available for
 
02:02:20.510 --> 02:02:20.520 align:start position:0%
adults with
 
02:02:23.109 --> 02:02:23.119 align:start position:0%
disabilities the bill will not disturb
 
02:02:25.229 --> 02:02:25.239 align:start position:0%
the availability of guardianship for the
 
02:02:27.310 --> 02:02:27.320 align:start position:0%
people who need for sometimes to have
 
02:02:29.870 --> 02:02:29.880 align:start position:0%
people make their own decisions for them
 
02:02:32.030 --> 02:02:32.040 align:start position:0%
if this bill was to become law the
 
02:02:33.830 --> 02:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
standard for creating a guardianship
 
02:02:35.510 --> 02:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
would still remain the same as it is
 
02:02:38.189 --> 02:02:38.199 align:start position:0%
today the bill merely creates an
 
02:02:40.910 --> 02:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
alternative for those common
 
02:02:44.310 --> 02:02:44.320 align:start position:0%
circumstances where support is needed
 
02:02:48.350 --> 02:02:48.360 align:start position:0%
but no removal of self-determination is
 
02:02:50.990 --> 02:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
and just a little notice to why I am
 
02:02:52.950 --> 02:02:52.960 align:start position:0%
supporting this spill so wholeheartedly
 
02:02:54.669 --> 02:02:54.679 align:start position:0%
is because I did become the legal
 
02:02:56.550 --> 02:02:56.560 align:start position:0%
guardian for my love beloved daughter
 
02:03:00.510 --> 02:03:00.520 align:start position:0%
Aaron at the age of 27 until she passed
 
02:03:02.910 --> 02:03:02.920 align:start position:0%
away at the age of 34 in
 
02:03:06.229 --> 02:03:06.239 align:start position:0%
2018 Aaron became physically disabled at
 
02:03:08.069 --> 02:03:08.079 align:start position:0%
age three when she developed a rare
 
02:03:10.990 --> 02:03:11.000 align:start position:0%
Childhood Cancer that left her with many
 
02:03:13.629 --> 02:03:13.639 align:start position:0%
unknown and known medical issues the
 
02:03:16.229 --> 02:03:16.239 align:start position:0%
side effects from the treatment also
 
02:03:18.030 --> 02:03:18.040 align:start position:0%
left her reasoning and her emotional
 
02:03:21.270 --> 02:03:21.280 align:start position:0%
levels a bit IM mature which does happen
 
02:03:23.310 --> 02:03:23.320 align:start position:0%
and in certain situations it caused her
 
02:03:26.629 --> 02:03:26.639 align:start position:0%
to think with her huge big heart and not
 
02:03:29.470 --> 02:03:29.480 align:start position:0%
always with her head I saw guardianship
 
02:03:31.629 --> 02:03:31.639 align:start position:0%
due to her many trips to the emergency
 
02:03:33.709 --> 02:03:33.719 align:start position:0%
room where I was no longer able to have
 
02:03:36.069 --> 02:03:36.079 align:start position:0%
a voice I couldn't help make decisions
 
02:03:38.470 --> 02:03:38.480 align:start position:0%
in her care and sometimes I was not even
 
02:03:40.470 --> 02:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
able to stay in the room during a
 
02:03:43.270 --> 02:03:43.280 align:start position:0%
consult usually I was met with that same
 
02:03:45.629 --> 02:03:45.639 align:start position:0%
social worker who told me over and over
 
02:03:47.830 --> 02:03:47.840 align:start position:0%
that I needed to get full guardianship
 
02:03:49.629 --> 02:03:49.639 align:start position:0%
to legally continue Contin to be part of
 
02:03:51.870 --> 02:03:51.880 align:start position:0%
her care so I
 
02:03:55.430 --> 02:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
did and it wasn't what either of us had
 
02:03:58.310 --> 02:03:58.320 align:start position:0%
expected and it tended to drive a stake
 
02:04:00.030 --> 02:04:00.040 align:start position:0%
between our loving
 
02:04:02.270 --> 02:04:02.280 align:start position:0%
relationship she felt she lost so much
 
02:04:04.589 --> 02:04:04.599 align:start position:0%
of her independence and her selfworth
 
02:04:06.950 --> 02:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
and I just wanted to be her mom I didn't
 
02:04:09.549 --> 02:04:09.559 align:start position:0%
want to have to control her life if
 
02:04:12.069 --> 02:04:12.079 align:start position:0%
supported decision making had been an
 
02:04:14.830 --> 02:04:14.840 align:start position:0%
option as an alternative to the
 
02:04:17.229 --> 02:04:17.239 align:start position:0%
guardianship I can't even begin to tell
 
02:04:18.350 --> 02:04:18.360 align:start position:0%
you what a difference that would have
 
02:04:20.750 --> 02:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
made in my my daughter's life my life

Lucy Weber I represent chesher 1 which
 
02:06:14.390 --> 02:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
is the Connecticut River towns of
 
02:06:17.030 --> 02:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
Hinsdale Chesterfield West merland and
 
02:06:19.229 --> 02:06:19.239 align:start position:0%
my own town of Walpole
 
02:06:23.950 --> 02:06:23.960 align:start position:0%
and one of my past lives I was um an
 
02:06:26.830 --> 02:06:26.840 align:start position:0%
attorney starting in Wills trusts and
 
02:06:30.069 --> 02:06:30.079 align:start position:0%
probate and then with a focus on what
 
02:06:32.589 --> 02:06:32.599 align:start position:0%
was then in the emerging um field of
 
02:06:36.870 --> 02:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
elder law now I'm just an elder um
 
02:06:40.350 --> 02:06:40.360 align:start position:0%
but I cannot tell you how much as an
 
02:06:43.470 --> 02:06:43.480 align:start position:0%
attorney I would have valued having this
 
02:06:49.390 --> 02:06:49.400 align:start position:0%
kind of a um process available uh to to
 
02:06:51.510 --> 02:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
for just the sorts of people that
 
02:06:54.030 --> 02:06:54.040 align:start position:0%
representative Chase um described and
 
02:06:56.310 --> 02:06:56.320 align:start position:0%
let me offer my sympathies on the loss
 
02:07:01.589 --> 02:07:01.599 align:start position:0%
of her beloved daughter um it allowing
 
02:07:05.870 --> 02:07:05.880 align:start position:0%
people their autonomy is a crucial point
 
02:07:08.189 --> 02:07:08.199 align:start position:0%
of all of our lives and and allowing
 
02:07:10.149 --> 02:07:10.159 align:start position:0%
people to make their own decisions as
 
02:07:13.750 --> 02:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
best they can uh a lot of what's in the
 
02:07:16.189 --> 02:07:16.199 align:start position:0%
bill is simply a matter of contract but
 
02:07:19.189 --> 02:07:19.199 align:start position:0%
and why not just have contracts well
 
02:07:21.229 --> 02:07:21.239 align:start position:0%
um a lot of what's in the bill helps
 
02:07:24.310 --> 02:07:24.320 align:start position:0%
with things like getting access to
 
02:07:28.189 --> 02:07:28.199 align:start position:0%
information that um holders of that
 
02:07:33.510 --> 02:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
information like um the IRS and other
 
02:07:35.629 --> 02:07:35.639 align:start position:0%
organizations don't want to release
 
02:07:37.350 --> 02:07:37.360 align:start position:0%
because they don't want to invade
 
02:07:41.270 --> 02:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
people's privacy but a decision helper
 
02:07:45.950 --> 02:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
might need access to them um and I also
 
02:07:49.430 --> 02:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
like the fact that there is a
 
02:07:52.709 --> 02:07:52.719 align:start position:0%
slight reference also
 
02:07:56.709 --> 02:07:56.719 align:start position:0%
to the ability to refer to DHHS which of
 
02:07:58.750 --> 02:07:58.760 align:start position:0%
course is already in statute to Adult
 
02:08:00.910 --> 02:08:00.920 align:start position:0%
Protective Services if if somebody
 
02:08:05.390 --> 02:08:05.400 align:start position:0%
encounters a um a dis a supporter that
 
02:08:07.390 --> 02:08:07.400 align:start position:0%
is not making decisions in the best
 
02:08:10.750 --> 02:08:10.760 align:start position:0%
interests of the um of the ward um the
 
02:08:13.589 --> 02:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
addition of the duty the fiduciary
 
02:08:16.709 --> 02:08:16.719 align:start position:0%
duties that are incorporated into this
 
02:08:18.709 --> 02:08:18.719 align:start position:0%
uh bill and the fiduciary standard are
 
02:08:20.430 --> 02:08:20.440 align:start position:0%
really necessary and I think it's a
 
02:08:22.910 --> 02:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
great concept I thoroughly support it
 
02:08:24.990 --> 02:08:25.000 align:start position:0%
and I look forward to hearing Mr skibby
 
02:08:26.950 --> 02:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
talk about it more but with that I will
 
02:08:28.470 --> 02:08:28.480 align:start position:0%

has lived the a very full life for many
 
02:09:44.390 --> 02:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
years without the assistance of a
 
02:09:46.830 --> 02:09:46.840 align:start position:0%
guardian but instead through the strong
 
02:09:49.830 --> 02:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
support of friends Family Support
 
02:09:51.950 --> 02:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
professionals and through formal and
 
02:09:53.629 --> 02:09:53.639 align:start position:0%
informal supported
 
02:09:56.270 --> 02:09:56.280 align:start position:0%
decision-making for Generations people
 
02:09:57.790 --> 02:09:57.800 align:start position:0%
with intellectual and developmental
 
02:10:00.870 --> 02:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
disabilities have been overprotected
 
02:10:03.750 --> 02:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
overcontrolled isolated segregated and
 
02:10:05.990 --> 02:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
excluded from our communities and we're
 
02:10:07.870 --> 02:10:07.880 align:start position:0%
often forced to live in places removed
 
02:10:09.549 --> 02:10:09.559 align:start position:0%
from the lives and experiences that
 
02:10:11.109 --> 02:10:11.119 align:start position:0%
people with disabilities take people
 
02:10:13.669 --> 02:10:13.679 align:start position:0%
without disabilities take for granted
 
02:10:15.870 --> 02:10:15.880 align:start position:0%
this kind of segregation and
 
02:10:18.069 --> 02:10:18.079 align:start position:0%
overprotection has led to a constrained
 
02:10:20.589 --> 02:10:20.599 align:start position:0%
life with a loss of power autonomy and
 
02:10:22.350 --> 02:10:22.360 align:start position:0%
other rights for so many people with
 
02:10:25.030 --> 02:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
disabilities we have long classified and
 
02:10:27.470 --> 02:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
categorized individuals who experience a
 
02:10:29.870 --> 02:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
disability rather than supporting them
 
02:10:32.310 --> 02:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
as important and cont contributing
 
02:10:35.510 --> 02:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
members of our society guardianship has
 
02:10:37.950 --> 02:10:37.960 align:start position:0%
long been the primary vehicle to
 
02:10:40.270 --> 02:10:40.280 align:start position:0%
so-called protect people experiencing a
 
02:10:43.069 --> 02:10:43.079 align:start position:0%
disability from making bad or wrong
 
02:10:45.229 --> 02:10:45.239 align:start position:0%
decisions about their lives and
 
02:10:47.669 --> 02:10:47.679 align:start position:0%
resources however awarding guardianship
 
02:10:50.030 --> 02:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
over a person person can often result in
 
02:10:52.109 --> 02:10:52.119 align:start position:0%
significant removal of basic rights that
 
02:10:54.709 --> 02:10:54.719 align:start position:0%
should not be taken lightly it can often
 
02:10:56.229 --> 02:10:56.239 align:start position:0%
result in people experiencing a
 
02:10:58.310 --> 02:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
disability being treated as if they were
 
02:11:00.629 --> 02:11:00.639 align:start position:0%
less than and incapable of managing
 
02:11:02.910 --> 02:11:02.920 align:start position:0%
their own lives including the most basic
 
02:11:05.549 --> 02:11:05.559 align:start position:0%
of life's choices people under full
 
02:11:07.430 --> 02:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
guardianship have no right to make their
 
02:11:09.470 --> 02:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
own decisions about their health care
 
02:11:12.189 --> 02:11:12.199 align:start position:0%
their finances their relationships and
 
02:11:14.790 --> 02:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
other day-to-day decisions people under
 
02:11:16.669 --> 02:11:16.679 align:start position:0%
guardianship are often less likely to
 
02:11:18.950 --> 02:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
live in their own homes or Apartments
 
02:11:20.470 --> 02:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
less likely to have jobs in the
 
02:11:22.470 --> 02:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
community and less likely to have
 
02:11:24.950 --> 02:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
friends this supported decision-making
 
02:11:27.510 --> 02:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
model gives individuals experiencing a
 
02:11:30.629 --> 02:11:30.639 align:start position:0%
disability like my sister-in-law a voice
 
02:11:32.910 --> 02:11:32.920 align:start position:0%
and helps them make their own decisions
 
02:11:35.589 --> 02:11:35.599 align:start position:0%
we all rely on others to help make
 
02:11:37.310 --> 02:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
decisions in our lives and people with
 
02:11:39.709 --> 02:11:39.719 align:start position:0%
disabilities may need more or just
 
02:11:41.830 --> 02:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
different type of help no one should be
 
02:11:43.669 --> 02:11:43.679 align:start position:0%
kept from making decisions about their
 
02:11:45.870 --> 02:11:45.880 align:start position:0%

this bill is a result of a collaborative

effort over the LA better part of the
 
02:13:30.750 --> 02:13:30.760 align:start position:0%
last year um with input from lawyers who

attention nationally in recent years in
 
02:13:51.750 --> 02:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
the last five years 10 states have
 
02:13:54.870 --> 02:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
adopted statutes like House Bill 540 uh
 
02:13:57.709 --> 02:13:57.719 align:start position:0%
would adopt um in addition National
 
02:13:59.629 --> 02:13:59.639 align:start position:0%

establishment of supported
 
02:14:10.149 --> 02:14:10.159 align:start position:0%
decision-making as an alternative in
 
02:14:12.149 --> 02:14:12.159 align:start position:0%
appropriate cases to
 
02:14:13.790 --> 02:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
guardianship there have also been
 
02:14:15.870 --> 02:14:15.880 align:start position:0%
initiatives that have been funded by the
 
02:14:17.350 --> 02:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
Federal Department of Health and Human
 
02:14:21.350 --> 02:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
Services to um explore and develop
 
02:14:22.990 --> 02:14:23.000 align:start position:0%
supported decision- making in the
 
02:14:25.390 --> 02:14:25.400 align:start position:0%
various States I think to appreciate the
 
02:14:27.109 --> 02:14:27.119 align:start position:0%
value of this bill it's important to
 
02:14:29.390 --> 02:14:29.400 align:start position:0%
understand the basics of guardianship
 
02:14:30.669 --> 02:14:30.679 align:start position:0%
it's the complete removal of
 
02:14:33.030 --> 02:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
decision-making and Choice by the court
 
02:14:35.790 --> 02:14:35.800 align:start position:0%
and the granting of that um authority to
 
02:14:38.069 --> 02:14:38.079 align:start position:0%
an appointed Guardian now the court May
 
02:14:40.109 --> 02:14:40.119 align:start position:0%
tailor and limit its order of
 
02:14:42.189 --> 02:14:42.199 align:start position:0%
guardianship but only in this sense of
 
02:14:45.069 --> 02:14:45.079 align:start position:0%
the subject areas that it covers that is
 
02:14:47.109 --> 02:14:47.119 align:start position:0%
if a guardianship is imposed with regard
 
02:14:48.830 --> 02:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
to Financial decision- making for
 
02:14:51.629 --> 02:14:51.639 align:start position:0%
example or housing decisions in that
 
02:14:53.629 --> 02:14:53.639 align:start position:0%
area are no longer controlled to any
 
02:14:56.390 --> 02:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
degree by the person with the disability
 
02:14:58.709 --> 02:14:58.719 align:start position:0%
they are controlled completely by the
 
02:15:00.870 --> 02:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
guardian commonly guardianship is
 
02:15:03.149 --> 02:15:03.159 align:start position:0%
granted in Broad areas including
 
02:15:05.229 --> 02:15:05.239 align:start position:0%
providing for things as basic as food
 
02:15:07.910 --> 02:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
and clothing and shelter but also health
 
02:15:10.149 --> 02:15:10.159 align:start position:0%
care and safety and management of
 
02:15:12.589 --> 02:15:12.599 align:start position:0%
property and financial affairs when it
 
02:15:14.830 --> 02:15:14.840 align:start position:0%
is broadly imposed it's very similar to
 
02:15:16.549 --> 02:15:16.559 align:start position:0%
the complete responsibility and
 
02:15:18.430 --> 02:15:18.440 align:start position:0%
Authority that a parent has has over a
 
02:15:21.189 --> 02:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
minor child now this is an important
 
02:15:22.870 --> 02:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
legal option to have available if
 
02:15:24.830 --> 02:15:24.840 align:start position:0%
someone is truly incapable of making
 
02:15:27.510 --> 02:15:27.520 align:start position:0%
decisions on their own behalf to any
 
02:15:29.870 --> 02:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
degree this bill would not remove it as
 
02:15:31.589 --> 02:15:31.599 align:start position:0%
an option for those who are truly in
 
02:15:34.470 --> 02:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
need of that level of intervention what
 
02:15:36.470 --> 02:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
this bill would do however is create a
 
02:15:38.430 --> 02:15:38.440 align:start position:0%
legally recognized alternative to
 
02:15:41.390 --> 02:15:41.400 align:start position:0%
guardianship that recognizes that many
 
02:15:43.790 --> 02:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
people with or without disabilities need
 
02:15:45.830 --> 02:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
support and advice when making important
 
02:15:48.030 --> 02:15:48.040 align:start position:0%
decisions but often only need need
 
02:15:50.390 --> 02:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
support and advice not removal of their
 
02:15:52.589 --> 02:15:52.599 align:start position:0%
freedom to make their own
 
02:15:54.990 --> 02:15:55.000 align:start position:0%
choices I suspect that like me all of
 
02:15:56.950 --> 02:15:56.960 align:start position:0%
you turn to trusted professionals or
 
02:15:58.910 --> 02:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
friends and family for advice about
 
02:16:01.270 --> 02:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
important decisions it may be to help
 
02:16:03.229 --> 02:16:03.239 align:start position:0%
with understanding certain unfamiliar
 
02:16:05.910 --> 02:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
information or helping to recognize and
 
02:16:08.430 --> 02:16:08.440 align:start position:0%
weigh the pros and cons of certain
 
02:16:10.470 --> 02:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
Alternatives that is essentially what is
 
02:16:12.750 --> 02:16:12.760 align:start position:0%
meant by supportive decision making and
 
02:16:14.589 --> 02:16:14.599 align:start position:0%
it works for people with disabilities in
 
02:16:16.709 --> 02:16:16.719 align:start position:0%
much the same way as anyone
 
02:16:16.719 --> 02:16:18.750 align:start position:0%
much the same way as anyone
else

02:16:18.750 --> 02:16:18.760 align:start position:0%
else
 
02:16:19.990 --> 02:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
people with disabilities who might
 
02:16:21.669 --> 02:16:21.679 align:start position:0%
otherwise be considered candidates for
 
02:16:23.870 --> 02:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
guardianship are frequently able to
 
02:16:25.830 --> 02:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
manage the choices and decisions in
 
02:16:27.669 --> 02:16:27.679 align:start position:0%
their life so long as they have the
 
02:16:30.069 --> 02:16:30.079 align:start position:0%
support and advice that they need now
 
02:16:31.709 --> 02:16:31.719 align:start position:0%
support May mean something like
 
02:16:33.549 --> 02:16:33.559 align:start position:0%
modifying the language used about a
 
02:16:35.910 --> 02:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
certain subject or helping to gather
 
02:16:38.349 --> 02:16:38.359 align:start position:0%
information that would be helpful or
 
02:16:40.030 --> 02:16:40.040 align:start position:0%
having a supporter present during
 
02:16:42.589 --> 02:16:42.599 align:start position:0%
meetings with doctors or other service
 
02:16:44.830 --> 02:16:44.840 align:start position:0%
providers this is a good example I think
 
02:16:47.070 --> 02:16:47.080 align:start position:0%
in a lot of our lives in my own case as
 
02:16:49.750 --> 02:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
my mother was at the end of her life my
 
02:16:51.349 --> 02:16:51.359 align:start position:0%
siblings and I would attend doctor's
 
02:16:53.549 --> 02:16:53.559 align:start position:0%
appointments with her not because she
 
02:16:55.230 --> 02:16:55.240 align:start position:0%
was unable to continue to make her own
 
02:16:56.990 --> 02:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
decisions but because it was helpful to
 
02:16:59.230 --> 02:16:59.240 align:start position:0%
have one of us there to help frame the
 
02:17:00.950 --> 02:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
conversation in a way that allowed her
 
02:17:03.429 --> 02:17:03.439 align:start position:0%
to understand and to assess the pros and
 
02:17:06.910 --> 02:17:06.920 align:start position:0%
cons of her choices and with our support
 
02:17:09.070 --> 02:17:09.080 align:start position:0%
the choices continued to be her choices
 
02:17:12.429 --> 02:17:12.439 align:start position:0%
not someone else's made on her
 
02:17:14.870 --> 02:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
behalf they were not always the choices
 
02:17:16.629 --> 02:17:16.639 align:start position:0%
that we would have had we would have
 
02:17:19.270 --> 02:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
wanted for her but they were her choices
 
02:17:20.830 --> 02:17:20.840 align:start position:0%
and that was an important component of
 
02:17:23.629 --> 02:17:23.639 align:start position:0%
her quality of life at the end of her
 
02:17:26.549 --> 02:17:26.559 align:start position:0%
life now House Bill 540 essentially
 
02:17:29.070 --> 02:17:29.080 align:start position:0%
recognizes the reality that many of us
 
02:17:30.990 --> 02:17:31.000 align:start position:0%
can retain our F freedom of choice so
 
02:17:33.190 --> 02:17:33.200 align:start position:0%
long as we have the support we need it
 
02:17:34.589 --> 02:17:34.599 align:start position:0%
probably goes without saying that if
 
02:17:36.830 --> 02:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
anyone is able to re is able to retain
 
02:17:38.629 --> 02:17:38.639 align:start position:0%
their freedom of choice they should be
 
02:17:41.270 --> 02:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
permitted to do so what may not be so
 
02:17:42.790 --> 02:17:42.800 align:start position:0%
obvious is that the maintenance of
 
02:17:44.629 --> 02:17:44.639 align:start position:0%
self-determination has significant
 
02:17:46.509 --> 02:17:46.519 align:start position:0%
benefits for an adult with disabilities
 
02:17:48.910 --> 02:17:48.920 align:start position:0%
beyond that as the parent of an adult
 
02:17:50.830 --> 02:17:50.840 align:start position:0%
using supported decision-making recently
 
02:17:53.110 --> 02:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
told me decision- making is a learned
 
02:17:55.589 --> 02:17:55.599 align:start position:0%
skill and as it is learned other things
 
02:17:57.830 --> 02:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
come along with it people who maintain
 
02:17:59.469 --> 02:17:59.479 align:start position:0%
their self-determination have been shown
 
02:18:02.150 --> 02:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
to be more independent healthier both
 
02:18:04.070 --> 02:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
physically and psychologically and
 
02:18:06.190 --> 02:18:06.200 align:start position:0%
better able to recognize and resist
 
02:18:08.709 --> 02:18:08.719 align:start position:0%
abuse and exploitation they also tend to
 
02:18:10.549 --> 02:18:10.559 align:start position:0%
be more integrated in their communities
 
02:18:12.509 --> 02:18:12.519 align:start position:0%
that is they're more likely to live and
 
02:18:14.910 --> 02:18:14.920 align:start position:0%
work with others who are also or not
 
02:18:16.509 --> 02:18:16.519 align:start position:0%
also people with
 
02:18:18.709 --> 02:18:18.719 align:start position:0%
disabilities now the bill is summarized
 
02:18:21.030 --> 02:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
in some detail in my written testimony
 
02:18:22.990 --> 02:18:23.000 align:start position:0%
but let me just briefly explain that the
 
02:18:24.950 --> 02:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
first few sections make changes to
 
02:18:27.230 --> 02:18:27.240 align:start position:0%
existing law to help facilitate
 
02:18:28.669 --> 02:18:28.679 align:start position:0%
implementation of supported
 
02:18:30.790 --> 02:18:30.800 align:start position:0%
decision-making and of the new statute
 
02:18:33.309 --> 02:18:33.319 align:start position:0%
that is created by the bill sections two
 
02:18:35.750 --> 02:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
and three of the of the bill make minor
 
02:18:37.830 --> 02:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
changes to the guardianship statute to
 
02:18:40.070 --> 02:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
identify the availability of supported
 
02:18:42.070 --> 02:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
decision-making as one of the things
 
02:18:44.589 --> 02:18:44.599 align:start position:0%
that a court can consider in determining
 
02:18:46.709 --> 02:18:46.719 align:start position:0%
whether guardianship is the only way to
 
02:18:48.230 --> 02:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
support and protect protect a person
 
02:18:51.629 --> 02:18:51.639 align:start position:0%
with disability and also as a basis for
 
02:18:52.870 --> 02:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
concluding that a particular
 
02:18:55.230 --> 02:18:55.240 align:start position:0%
guardianship is no longer
 
02:18:58.150 --> 02:18:58.160 align:start position:0%
needed section four deals with special
 
02:18:59.790 --> 02:18:59.800 align:start position:0%
education law and it deals with the
 
02:19:02.150 --> 02:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
specific issue of transition of a
 
02:19:04.469 --> 02:19:04.479 align:start position:0%
special education student this is an
 
02:19:06.190 --> 02:19:06.200 align:start position:0%
area of current responsibility of
 
02:19:08.230 --> 02:19:08.240 align:start position:0%
special education staff to help prepare
 
02:19:10.870 --> 02:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
a child with a disability for adult life
 
02:19:13.270 --> 02:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
after schooling is completed sometimes
 
02:19:14.990 --> 02:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
this includes discussions of whether
 
02:19:16.830 --> 02:19:16.840 align:start position:0%
guardianship should be pursued by a
 
02:19:20.309 --> 02:19:20.319 align:start position:0%
family Upon a Child turning 18 now
 
02:19:22.110 --> 02:19:22.120 align:start position:0%
families often pursue guardianship
 
02:19:23.750 --> 02:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
because they do not know of alternative
 
02:19:26.070 --> 02:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
ways to remain involved in their child's
 
02:19:28.910 --> 02:19:28.920 align:start position:0%
life in early adult into early adulthood
 
02:19:30.790 --> 02:19:30.800 align:start position:0%
and once guardianship is in place it is
 
02:19:33.389 --> 02:19:33.399 align:start position:0%
very uncommon for it to be undone what
 
02:19:34.950 --> 02:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
the bill would do would be D would
 
02:19:37.190 --> 02:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
direct that special Educators include
 
02:19:39.070 --> 02:19:39.080 align:start position:0%
information about the supported
 
02:19:41.309 --> 02:19:41.319 align:start position:0%
decision-making alternative if they have
 
02:19:43.669 --> 02:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
discussions with a family about pursuing
 
02:19:46.309 --> 02:19:46.319 align:start position:0%
guardianship it does not require that
 
02:19:48.870 --> 02:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
such a discussion occur Ur but it does
 
02:19:50.590 --> 02:19:50.600 align:start position:0%
require that if a guardianship
 
02:19:53.309 --> 02:19:53.319 align:start position:0%
discussion occurs that it include the
 
02:19:56.830 --> 02:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
alternative of supported decision making
 
02:19:58.590 --> 02:19:58.600 align:start position:0%
that section of the bill further directs
 
02:20:00.630 --> 02:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
that the Department of Education prepare
 
02:20:02.790 --> 02:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
information to be used in such
 
02:20:04.630 --> 02:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
discussions so that local school
 
02:20:06.230 --> 02:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
districts are not required to prepare
 
02:20:07.670 --> 02:20:07.680 align:start position:0%
their own
 
02:20:10.510 --> 02:20:10.520 align:start position:0%
materials the remainder of the bill sets
 
02:20:12.429 --> 02:20:12.439 align:start position:0%
up the new chapter establishing
 
02:20:14.190 --> 02:20:14.200 align:start position:0%
supportive decision- making as a formal
 
02:20:16.590 --> 02:20:16.600 align:start position:0%
alternative to guardianship um I won't
 
02:20:19.510 --> 02:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
go through it uh line by line but I do
 
02:20:21.030 --> 02:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
just want to point
 
02:20:24.790 --> 02:20:24.800 align:start position:0%
out some of the I think key components
 
02:20:28.429 --> 02:20:28.439 align:start position:0%
of the of the new statute um on page
 
02:20:31.590 --> 02:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
four line 23 it lays out the necessary
 
02:20:34.910 --> 02:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
components of an of a of a adequate
 
02:20:37.270 --> 02:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
supported decision-making agreement it
 
02:20:38.750 --> 02:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
requires that there be at least one
 
02:20:40.710 --> 02:20:40.720 align:start position:0%
supporter a description of the subject
 
02:20:42.870 --> 02:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
matter a description of any subject
 
02:20:45.469 --> 02:20:45.479 align:start position:0%
matter that is excluded from the uh
 
02:20:47.950 --> 02:20:47.960 align:start position:0%
Arrangement um how it has to be written
 
02:20:52.190 --> 02:20:52.200 align:start position:0%
and dated and witnessed uh so forth um
 
02:20:55.429 --> 02:20:55.439 align:start position:0%
on page six starting at line 16 it
 
02:20:57.670 --> 02:20:57.680 align:start position:0%
describes the fiduciary relationship
 
02:21:00.830 --> 02:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
that supporters need to uh have to their
 
02:21:03.389 --> 02:21:03.399 align:start position:0%
principal and how their Authority is
 
02:21:05.469 --> 02:21:05.479 align:start position:0%
limited to what is given to them in the
 
02:21:09.030 --> 02:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
agreement on page seven starting at page
 
02:21:11.670 --> 02:21:11.680 align:start position:0%
starting at line 10 it talks about who
 
02:21:13.510 --> 02:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
may not be supporters including
 
02:21:16.469 --> 02:21:16.479 align:start position:0%
employers or employees of the principal
 
02:21:18.389 --> 02:21:18.399 align:start position:0%
people who are paid to provide services
 
02:21:20.790 --> 02:21:20.800 align:start position:0%
to the principal or people who've been
 
02:21:23.190 --> 02:21:23.200 align:start position:0%
convicted of certain offenses or against
 
02:21:25.270 --> 02:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
whom orders or protection have
 
02:21:29.790 --> 02:21:29.800 align:start position:0%
issued on line 34 of that of that same
 
02:21:34.070 --> 02:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
page page seven um it describes the the
 
02:21:37.429 --> 02:21:37.439 align:start position:0%
obligation um to make a report of abuse
 
02:21:40.070 --> 02:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
if a persons who are aware of abuse or
 
02:21:45.030 --> 02:21:45.040 align:start position:0%
exploitation by a supporter um uh uh I'm
 
02:21:46.910 --> 02:21:46.920 align:start position:0%
sorry if they if a person becomes aware
 
02:21:49.070 --> 02:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
of such abuse or exploitation by a
 
02:21:53.349 --> 02:21:53.359 align:start position:0%
supporter um I think that
 
02:21:55.830 --> 02:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
um um in conclusion I just wanted to
 
02:21:58.349 --> 02:21:58.359 align:start position:0%
point out that um New Hampshire uses
 
02:22:00.270 --> 02:22:00.280 align:start position:0%
guardianship actually more than the
 
02:22:02.990 --> 02:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
average State um I looked at some data
 
02:22:04.950 --> 02:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
from about four years ago from a survey
 
02:22:06.550 --> 02:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
of adults with intellectual and
 
02:22:09.110 --> 02:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities who receive
 
02:22:11.510 --> 02:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
state agency services in the various
 
02:22:15.150 --> 02:22:15.160 align:start position:0%
States now among that group The
 
02:22:19.870 --> 02:22:19.880 align:start position:0%
guardianship rate nationally was 56% 56%
 
02:22:21.510 --> 02:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
of those people surveyed around the
 
02:22:24.510 --> 02:22:24.520 align:start position:0%
country had Guardians in New Hampshire
 
02:22:26.030 --> 02:22:26.040 align:start position:0%
it was
 
02:22:31.070 --> 02:22:31.080 align:start position:0%
76% um three quarters um 20% higher rate
 
02:22:33.590 --> 02:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
than the national rate so that could
 
02:22:35.830 --> 02:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
mean a lot of things but I think it's a
 
02:22:37.710 --> 02:22:37.720 align:start position:0%
probably pretty strong indication that
 
02:22:39.830 --> 02:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
we may have people under guardianship in
 
02:22:41.950 --> 02:22:41.960 align:start position:0%
this state that could be successful
 
02:22:44.429 --> 02:22:44.439 align:start position:0%
using other models of support and so it
 
02:22:45.910 --> 02:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
makes sense for us to make sure that
 
02:22:47.990 --> 02:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
people have a range of alternatives AES
 
02:22:49.910 --> 02:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
and House Bill 540 would be a strong
 
02:22:51.710 --> 02:22:51.720 align:start position:0%
step in that direction without
 
02:22:53.270 --> 02:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
diminishing the availability of
 
02:22:55.790 --> 02:22:55.800 align:start position:0%
guardianship for people who know need
 
02:22:57.429 --> 02:22:57.439 align:start position:0%
that level of structure and sub
 
02:22:59.750 --> 02:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
substitute a decision
 
02:23:01.870 --> 02:23:01.880 align:start position:0%
making thank you for your attention I'd
 
02:23:04.510 --> 02:23:04.520 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer any questions thank
 
02:23:07.070 --> 02:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
02:23:10.230 --> 02:23:10.240 align:start position:0%
Paige thank you thank you Mr chairman um
 
02:23:11.750 --> 02:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question
 
02:23:15.269 --> 02:23:15.279 align:start position:0%
attorney skibby um I have a question I
 
02:23:17.590 --> 02:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
read that the New Hampshire school
 
02:23:18.790 --> 02:23:18.800 align:start position:0%
special ed
 
02:23:22.510 --> 02:23:22.520 align:start position:0%
administrators Association had some um
 
02:23:24.070 --> 02:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
questions I believe they supported the
 
02:23:26.030 --> 02:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
bill I don't want to mate what they
 
02:23:27.309 --> 02:23:27.319 align:start position:0%
wrote in their letter but was my
 
02:23:28.990 --> 02:23:29.000 align:start position:0%
recollection and and it looks like
 
02:23:31.150 --> 02:23:31.160 align:start position:0%
there's an amendment to that I think
 
02:23:34.790 --> 02:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
provided by um representative Chase um
 
02:23:36.070 --> 02:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
does that
 
02:23:38.429 --> 02:23:38.439 align:start position:0%
address their concerns because in their
 
02:23:40.950 --> 02:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
their memo they had noted they would be
 
02:23:43.469 --> 02:23:43.479 align:start position:0%
talking with with you so I wanted to see
 
02:23:45.429 --> 02:23:45.439 align:start position:0%
if if that if you if you feel like
 
02:23:48.750 --> 02:23:48.760 align:start position:0%
that's that amendment's comp has been a
 
02:23:51.830 --> 02:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
a compromise and then the second part if
 
02:23:55.910 --> 02:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
I may is whether if you could if if if I
 
02:23:57.510 --> 02:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
if you could just sort of
 
02:24:00.990 --> 02:24:01.000 align:start position:0%
describe what the the in the sharing of
 
02:24:03.510 --> 02:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
that information would look like so that
 
02:24:04.950 --> 02:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
it would be a
 
02:24:09.830 --> 02:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
meaningful um um sharing at the IEP
 
02:24:12.309 --> 02:24:12.319 align:start position:0%
table I think thank you um
 
02:24:14.790 --> 02:24:14.800 align:start position:0%
representative Paige um and I probably
 
02:24:17.510 --> 02:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
should have um spent a few moments on on
 
02:24:19.670 --> 02:24:19.680 align:start position:0%
uh the amendment that uh representative
 
02:24:22.750 --> 02:24:22.760 align:start position:0%
Chase is going to be bringing forward um
 
02:24:25.309 --> 02:24:25.319 align:start position:0%
to take the last part first I think
 
02:24:29.429 --> 02:24:29.439 align:start position:0%
probably helpful to think about how this
 
02:24:31.990 --> 02:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility put on special Educators
 
02:24:36.190 --> 02:24:36.200 align:start position:0%
Educators would be um would be fulfilled
 
02:24:38.910 --> 02:24:38.920 align:start position:0%
and and what we have in mind is the
 
02:24:42.990 --> 02:24:43.000 align:start position:0%
development of a fairly simple piece of
 
02:24:45.150 --> 02:24:45.160 align:start position:0%
written information like a pamphlet that
 
02:24:46.590 --> 02:24:46.600 align:start position:0%
would be developed by the Department of
 
02:24:48.790 --> 02:24:48.800 align:start position:0%
Education ation that would be available
 
02:24:51.550 --> 02:24:51.560 align:start position:0%
to an IEP team that is the group of
 
02:24:53.590 --> 02:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
special Educators that work with a
 
02:24:58.190 --> 02:24:58.200 align:start position:0%
family um to hand over to the family as
 
02:25:01.469 --> 02:25:01.479 align:start position:0%
they begin this discussion of possible
 
02:25:03.230 --> 02:25:03.240 align:start position:0%
guardianship if they choose to have that
 
02:25:05.870 --> 02:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
discussion so that that that their
 
02:25:07.790 --> 02:25:07.800 align:start position:0%
responsibility would be fulfilled by
 
02:25:10.309 --> 02:25:10.319 align:start position:0%
simply passing along the information
 
02:25:11.469 --> 02:25:11.479 align:start position:0%
that had been developed by the
 
02:25:13.510 --> 02:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Education and I think the
 
02:25:15.950 --> 02:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
Department of Education is directed to
 
02:25:17.429 --> 02:25:17.439 align:start position:0%
basically consult with
 
02:25:19.870 --> 02:25:19.880 align:start position:0%
organizations like my own and many of
 
02:25:21.510 --> 02:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
the other disability rights
 
02:25:24.910 --> 02:25:24.920 align:start position:0%
organizations in the state um to develop
 
02:25:27.510 --> 02:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
a relatively straightforward explanation
 
02:25:29.030 --> 02:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
of the supported decision-making
 
02:25:32.190 --> 02:25:32.200 align:start position:0%
alternative now the the amendment
 
02:25:38.309 --> 02:25:38.319 align:start position:0%
itself um makes some uh some I won't
 
02:25:41.349 --> 02:25:41.359 align:start position:0%
call them stylistic decisions uh uh
 
02:25:44.750 --> 02:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
changes but um some modifications to the
 
02:25:48.870 --> 02:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
language of um um section four of the
 
02:25:51.349 --> 02:25:51.359 align:start position:0%
bill that came as a result of a
 
02:25:54.550 --> 02:25:54.560 align:start position:0%
discussion I had with the uh specialed
 
02:25:54.560 --> 02:25:56.349 align:start position:0%
discussion I had with the uh specialed
administrators

02:25:56.349 --> 02:25:56.359 align:start position:0%
administrators
 
02:26:00.190 --> 02:26:00.200 align:start position:0%
Association um it would make clear that
 
02:26:03.389 --> 02:26:03.399 align:start position:0%
the obligation would only arise if there
 
02:26:05.550 --> 02:26:05.560 align:start position:0%
is an actual discussion of guardianship
 
02:26:07.469 --> 02:26:07.479 align:start position:0%
with a family not if it's simply being
 
02:26:09.590 --> 02:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
considered which is the current bill
 
02:26:14.630 --> 02:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
language um it also would
 
02:26:17.469 --> 02:26:17.479 align:start position:0%
um um
 
02:26:18.750 --> 02:26:18.760 align:start position:0%
make some
 
02:26:21.469 --> 02:26:21.479 align:start position:0%
changes with regard that just sort of
 
02:26:25.349 --> 02:26:25.359 align:start position:0%
clarifying how let how um releases of
 
02:26:26.790 --> 02:26:26.800 align:start position:0%
information would have to be executed by
 
02:26:28.550 --> 02:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
the principal would not be executed by a
 
02:26:31.710 --> 02:26:31.720 align:start position:0%
supporter there's some additional um
 
02:26:33.389 --> 02:26:33.399 align:start position:0%
concern that they raised I believe in
 
02:26:36.230 --> 02:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
their letter if I recall it correctly
 
02:26:38.550 --> 02:26:38.560 align:start position:0%
about what they've referred to as a hold
 
02:26:42.349 --> 02:26:42.359 align:start position:0%
harmless provision um I think I need to
 
02:26:44.309 --> 02:26:44.319 align:start position:0%
give further consideration to that and
 
02:26:45.950 --> 02:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
perhaps have some further discussions
 
02:26:47.670 --> 02:26:47.680 align:start position:0%
with them about whether
 
02:26:50.070 --> 02:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
that would make sense um I think the
 
02:26:53.710 --> 02:26:53.720 align:start position:0%
liability concerns that they may have um
 
02:26:55.790 --> 02:26:55.800 align:start position:0%
I don't think I share those concerns but
 
02:26:57.910 --> 02:26:57.920 align:start position:0%
I'm I think I'm willing to and I think
 
02:26:59.429 --> 02:26:59.439 align:start position:0%
that that representative Chase is
 
02:27:01.590 --> 02:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
willing to give that some further
 
02:27:06.750 --> 02:27:06.760 align:start position:0%
consideration thank you representative
 
02:27:09.550 --> 02:27:09.560 align:start position:0%
Sylvia thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
02:27:12.429 --> 02:27:12.439 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question Mr sky and
 
02:27:14.190 --> 02:27:14.200 align:start position:0%
before I get to the question uh my
 
02:27:16.830 --> 02:27:16.840 align:start position:0%
question i' like to apologize the flow
 
02:27:18.590 --> 02:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
of information coming through email
 
02:27:21.389 --> 02:27:21.399 align:start position:0%
these days is swamping US particularly
 
02:27:24.550 --> 02:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
me I guess and uh I have gotten emails
 
02:27:26.349 --> 02:27:26.359 align:start position:0%
and paid attention to them but haven't
 
02:27:32.670 --> 02:27:32.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:36.870 --> 02:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
um this the language in this bill is is
 
02:27:39.150 --> 02:27:39.160 align:start position:0%
good I like a lot of it there is one
 
02:27:43.070 --> 02:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
concern that I see for these folks and
 
02:27:46.030 --> 02:27:46.040 align:start position:0%
particularly the support people uh
 
02:27:48.510 --> 02:27:48.520 align:start position:0%
there's been disc discussion a lot of
 
02:27:50.910 --> 02:27:50.920 align:start position:0%
discussion over the last few years about
 
02:27:54.510 --> 02:27:54.520 align:start position:0%
uh statutes for V vulnerable
 
02:27:58.830 --> 02:27:58.840 align:start position:0%
adults and it would seem that the
 
02:28:01.670 --> 02:28:01.680 align:start position:0%
support persons would be possibly in an
 
02:28:06.150 --> 02:28:06.160 align:start position:0%
awkward position uh should such a uh
 
02:28:10.349 --> 02:28:10.359 align:start position:0%
statute be enacted do you feel that
 
02:28:13.790 --> 02:28:13.800 align:start position:0%
lacking that um that proposed
 
02:28:17.230 --> 02:28:17.240 align:start position:0%
legislation are are these folks
 
02:28:19.429 --> 02:28:19.439 align:start position:0%
uh going to be protected enough by the
 
02:28:21.830 --> 02:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
current statutes that they won't be
 
02:28:24.790 --> 02:28:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:26.910 --> 02:28:26.920 align:start position:0%
abuse um thank you for the question
 
02:28:29.950 --> 02:28:29.960 align:start position:0%
representative Sylvia
 
02:28:32.389 --> 02:28:32.399 align:start position:0%
um so if I if I'm understanding your
 
02:28:34.790 --> 02:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
question correctly it's it's it's
 
02:28:37.070 --> 02:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
getting at whether the use of a
 
02:28:39.309 --> 02:28:39.319 align:start position:0%
supported decision-making
 
02:28:41.750 --> 02:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
agreement um would make an otherwise
 
02:28:44.790 --> 02:28:44.800 align:start position:0%
vulnerable person um more vulnerable
 
02:28:47.190 --> 02:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
than they would be in the case of
 
02:28:49.510 --> 02:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
guardianship is that is that the gist of
 
02:28:52.429 --> 02:28:52.439 align:start position:0%
it yes uh it seems like there's a lot of
 
02:28:55.469 --> 02:28:55.479 align:start position:0%
responsibility for the sport person and
 
02:28:58.630 --> 02:28:58.640 align:start position:0%
right uh is there a danger to them is
 
02:29:02.150 --> 02:29:02.160 align:start position:0%
there a reason for them to be afraid
 
02:29:04.670 --> 02:29:04.680 align:start position:0%
that signing up to be a sport person
 
02:29:07.670 --> 02:29:07.680 align:start position:0%
would be a problem for them well I you
 
02:29:09.990 --> 02:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
know it's certainly something that I
 
02:29:13.910 --> 02:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
think anyone should um should consider
 
02:29:17.670 --> 02:29:17.680 align:start position:0%
carefully before entering um into to but
 
02:29:21.190 --> 02:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
but I I think that um you know it is a
 
02:29:23.590 --> 02:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
completely voluntary Arrangement and no
 
02:29:25.830 --> 02:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
one is compelled to be a supporter um
 
02:29:27.870 --> 02:29:27.880 align:start position:0%
who does not wish to be I think it's
 
02:29:29.950 --> 02:29:29.960 align:start position:0%
probably good to recognize that these
 
02:29:33.150 --> 02:29:33.160 align:start position:0%
kinds of Arrangements exist today
 
02:29:35.910 --> 02:29:35.920 align:start position:0%
although they may not be formally um
 
02:29:38.590 --> 02:29:38.600 align:start position:0%
recognized so for example just as you
 
02:29:41.190 --> 02:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
heard Senator Whitley describe and there
 
02:29:42.990 --> 02:29:43.000 align:start position:0%
were other co-sponsors who described
 
02:29:45.309 --> 02:29:45.319 align:start position:0%
similar situations to me where they have
 
02:29:47.269 --> 02:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
a family member that they they basically
 
02:29:49.790 --> 02:29:49.800 align:start position:0%
act as a supporter just as the this
 
02:29:52.710 --> 02:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
statute would comp uh would contemplate
 
02:29:55.230 --> 02:29:55.240 align:start position:0%
um but it's done in an unformal informal
 
02:29:58.790 --> 02:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
and unrecognized way um and so they've
 
02:30:00.309 --> 02:30:00.319 align:start position:0%
they've stepped forward to provide
 
02:30:02.990 --> 02:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
assistance and I they don't incur any
 
02:30:05.150 --> 02:30:05.160 align:start position:0%
liability by doing so and I don't think
 
02:30:07.269 --> 02:30:07.279 align:start position:0%
any liability is incurred by this
 
02:30:09.309 --> 02:30:09.319 align:start position:0%
statute itself and the statute
 
02:30:12.230 --> 02:30:12.240 align:start position:0%
recognizes that a supporter may decide
 
02:30:14.710 --> 02:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
to terminate their involvement in a
 
02:30:17.030 --> 02:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
supported decision-making agreement
 
02:30:20.030 --> 02:30:20.040 align:start position:0%
what I do think is helpful here is that
 
02:30:24.150 --> 02:30:24.160 align:start position:0%
the the the formalizing of this uh as an
 
02:30:26.230 --> 02:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
option it
 
02:30:26.240 --> 02:30:28.309 align:start position:0%
option it
basically

02:30:28.309 --> 02:30:28.319 align:start position:0%
basically
 
02:30:31.830 --> 02:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
um it draws the attention of all parties
 
02:30:33.710 --> 02:30:33.720 align:start position:0%
to the agreement the principal the
 
02:30:35.389 --> 02:30:35.399 align:start position:0%
person with the disability and the
 
02:30:37.950 --> 02:30:37.960 align:start position:0%
potential supporter to what it is that
 
02:30:40.630 --> 02:30:40.640 align:start position:0%
they're signing up for the agreement
 
02:30:42.550 --> 02:30:42.560 align:start position:0%
basically identifies to the supporter
 
02:30:43.990 --> 02:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
that this is the obligation that you're
 
02:30:45.590 --> 02:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
undertaking and it requires the
 
02:30:47.630 --> 02:30:47.640 align:start position:0%
supporter to ack knowledge that they
 
02:30:49.790 --> 02:30:49.800 align:start position:0%
understand that um and I think that
 
02:30:52.190 --> 02:30:52.200 align:start position:0%
that's good for both parties to the
 
02:30:53.790 --> 02:30:53.800 align:start position:0%
agreement so that there's no
 
02:30:56.349 --> 02:30:56.359 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding and potential you know
 
02:30:58.429 --> 02:30:58.439 align:start position:0%
the potential of of something dropping
 
02:31:01.269 --> 02:31:01.279 align:start position:0%
between the cracks as you might have in
 
02:31:02.990 --> 02:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
today's you know
 
02:31:05.230 --> 02:31:05.240 align:start position:0%
circumstances I also think when we are
 
02:31:06.550 --> 02:31:06.560 align:start position:0%
thinking about
 
02:31:08.750 --> 02:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
vulnerability the research shows that
 
02:31:11.870 --> 02:31:11.880 align:start position:0%
people who enter into these agreements
 
02:31:14.429 --> 02:31:14.439 align:start position:0%
or otherwise maintain their
 
02:31:16.630 --> 02:31:16.640 align:start position:0%
self-determination by avoiding Guardian
 
02:31:18.550 --> 02:31:18.560 align:start position:0%
ship are actually less likely to be
 
02:31:20.469 --> 02:31:20.479 align:start position:0%
exploited and less likely to be
 
02:31:22.590 --> 02:31:22.600 align:start position:0%
vulnerable um because as I was
 
02:31:24.389 --> 02:31:24.399 align:start position:0%
discussing before when people have that
 
02:31:26.670 --> 02:31:26.680 align:start position:0%
self-determination they tend to be more
 
02:31:28.990 --> 02:31:29.000 align:start position:0%
aware of what's going on around them and
 
02:31:31.910 --> 02:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
more ability to assert themselves to
 
02:31:34.630 --> 02:31:34.640 align:start position:0%
avoid abuse and exploitation so I think
 
02:31:35.950 --> 02:31:35.960 align:start position:0%
it certainly makes the people with
 
02:31:38.070 --> 02:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
disabilities probably more resilient not
 
02:31:39.590 --> 02:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
less resilient and I think the
 
02:31:41.469 --> 02:31:41.479 align:start position:0%
formalizing of the agreement probably
 
02:31:43.030 --> 02:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
makes it more likely that somebody who
 
02:31:45.429 --> 02:31:45.439 align:start position:0%
agrees to be a supporter will go in with
 
02:31:46.870 --> 02:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
their eyes wide open
 
02:31:50.670 --> 02:31:50.680 align:start position:0%
rather than under today's regime thank
 
02:31:53.830 --> 02:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
you any other questions for Mr for
 
02:31:56.990 --> 02:31:57.000 align:start position:0%
attorney give yes representative
 
02:32:01.309 --> 02:32:01.319 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you very much Mr Speaker um
 
02:32:04.630 --> 02:32:04.640 align:start position:0%
uh I first want to begin by sympathizing
 
02:32:07.030 --> 02:32:07.040 align:start position:0%
with what representative Sylvia noted
 
02:32:09.230 --> 02:32:09.240 align:start position:0%
that we are um
 
02:32:14.349 --> 02:32:14.359 align:start position:0%
drowning in emails in text messages in
 
02:32:17.990 --> 02:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
material that we do or do not print out
 
02:32:20.830 --> 02:32:20.840 align:start position:0%
and it's very hard to make sure that
 
02:32:24.670 --> 02:32:24.680 align:start position:0%
we're not missing any information that
 
02:32:27.590 --> 02:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
would help us make an informed decision
 
02:32:31.990 --> 02:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
um we received some uh written testimony
 
02:32:36.590 --> 02:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
from um an attorney in um in New
 
02:32:38.910 --> 02:32:38.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire whose name is Sheila
 
02:32:43.150 --> 02:32:43.160 align:start position:0%
Zachary and I don't know if you have had
 
02:32:45.309 --> 02:32:45.319 align:start position:0%
an opport I know you know her I don't
 
02:32:47.110 --> 02:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
know if you've had an an opportunity to
 
02:32:49.870 --> 02:32:49.880 align:start position:0%
discuss anything with about this bill
 
02:32:55.309 --> 02:32:55.319 align:start position:0%
with her but her testimony is really uh
 
02:32:58.550 --> 02:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
I think very interesting um she talks
 
02:33:03.590 --> 02:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
about what she sees as rather over Brad
 
02:33:06.990 --> 02:33:07.000 align:start position:0%
definitions and um for example quotes
 
02:33:09.269 --> 02:33:09.279 align:start position:0%
most people with disabilities have the
 
02:33:11.790 --> 02:33:11.800 align:start position:0%
ability to make decisions for themselves
 
02:33:14.269 --> 02:33:14.279 align:start position:0%
when they are provided the necessary
 
02:33:17.349 --> 02:33:17.359 align:start position:0%
information and support to do
 
02:33:21.950 --> 02:33:21.960 align:start position:0%
so um uh Miss Zachary's interpretation
 
02:33:26.550 --> 02:33:26.560 align:start position:0%
of this is um less than positive um she
 
02:33:29.030 --> 02:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
uses a a very interest there is a
 
02:33:33.510 --> 02:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
question there is a question uh Mr chair
 
02:33:37.670 --> 02:33:37.680 align:start position:0%
um I won't explain more about what she
 
02:33:42.190 --> 02:33:42.200 align:start position:0%
says but as you read the language
 
02:33:44.870 --> 02:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
particularly in the statement of
 
02:33:50.349 --> 02:33:50.359 align:start position:0%
findings do you have any sense
 
02:33:55.550 --> 02:33:55.560 align:start position:0%
that certainly not by um
 
02:33:58.590 --> 02:33:58.600 align:start position:0%
intention uh but by result that the
 
02:34:01.870 --> 02:34:01.880 align:start position:0%
language in the findings in some ways
 
02:34:04.070 --> 02:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
insults or
 
02:34:07.510 --> 02:34:07.520 align:start position:0%
diminishes um the awareness of the
 
02:34:11.309 --> 02:34:11.319 align:start position:0%
ability of people with disabilities to
 
02:34:14.590 --> 02:34:14.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:17.030 --> 02:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
decisions um thank you you for the
 
02:34:19.230 --> 02:34:19.240 align:start position:0%
question representative Smith um I don't
 
02:34:23.870 --> 02:34:23.880 align:start position:0%
know attorney Zachary um um but um I I
 
02:34:26.030 --> 02:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
know of her and I know that she is a a
 
02:34:28.710 --> 02:34:28.720 align:start position:0%
lawyer who's done work in this field um
 
02:34:31.590 --> 02:34:31.600 align:start position:0%
for some time
 
02:34:37.030 --> 02:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
um I guess um all I can say is that as
 
02:34:40.630 --> 02:34:40.640 align:start position:0%
the person who drafted that language um
 
02:34:44.870 --> 02:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
I don't think it um communicates what um
 
02:34:47.349 --> 02:34:47.359 align:start position:0%
attorney Zachary takes it to communicate
 
02:34:51.150 --> 02:34:51.160 align:start position:0%
but I wouldn't dispute that she honestly
 
02:34:54.429 --> 02:34:54.439 align:start position:0%
um received it that way um and if others
 
02:34:56.990 --> 02:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
receive it that way and the committee
 
02:35:00.429 --> 02:35:00.439 align:start position:0%
wishes to modify those findings I think
 
02:35:02.190 --> 02:35:02.200 align:start position:0%
that is absolutely fine with me and if
 
02:35:03.790 --> 02:35:03.800 align:start position:0%
you'd like me to participate in a
 
02:35:08.469 --> 02:35:08.479 align:start position:0%
process to um to um adjust the language
 
02:35:11.469 --> 02:35:11.479 align:start position:0%
I would be happy to do that they are not
 
02:35:14.150 --> 02:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
definitions so they you know changing
 
02:35:17.950 --> 02:35:17.960 align:start position:0%
that language will not disturb the
 
02:35:21.510 --> 02:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
actual um law after this bill is
 
02:35:24.830 --> 02:35:24.840 align:start position:0%
hopefully um uh brought to final passage
 
02:35:27.230 --> 02:35:27.240 align:start position:0%
so I I would have no problem if it is
 
02:35:29.190 --> 02:35:29.200 align:start position:0%
the will of the committee to make
 
02:35:31.269 --> 02:35:31.279 align:start position:0%
adjustments to those findings so they um
 
02:35:33.670 --> 02:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
are not offensive to anyone could I
 
02:35:37.190 --> 02:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
follow up you may thank you very much Mr
 
02:35:40.389 --> 02:35:40.399 align:start position:0%
chairman so um is it safe to say Mr
 
02:35:45.550 --> 02:35:45.560 align:start position:0%
skibby that in your judgment if we um
 
02:35:49.030 --> 02:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
elim minated or severely
 
02:35:52.150 --> 02:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
modified uh the statement of findings
 
02:35:55.910 --> 02:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
and focused instead on the actual
 
02:36:00.510 --> 02:36:00.520 align:start position:0%
language of the um of the bill for what
 
02:36:04.070 --> 02:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
you propos to do that we would not be
 
02:36:09.389 --> 02:36:09.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:11.950 --> 02:36:11.960 align:start position:0%
um the import of the
 
02:36:15.030 --> 02:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
bill that is what I that is what I I
 
02:36:18.110 --> 02:36:18.120 align:start position:0%
mean to say that I I think that you can
 
02:36:20.990 --> 02:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
you can adjust the statement of findings
 
02:36:24.070 --> 02:36:24.080 align:start position:0%
um uh significantly or even eliminate
 
02:36:29.230 --> 02:36:29.240 align:start position:0%
them without changing um uh the the uh
 
02:36:31.150 --> 02:36:31.160 align:start position:0%
the substantive law that would be
 
02:36:33.750 --> 02:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
adopted by The Bill thank you very much
 
02:36:37.309 --> 02:36:37.319 align:start position:0%
Mr Skiby thank you Mr chair thank
 
02:36:39.550 --> 02:36:39.560 align:start position:0%
you there any other questions for
 
02:36:39.560 --> 02:36:41.429 align:start position:0%
you there any other questions for
attorney

02:36:41.429 --> 02:36:41.439 align:start position:0%
attorney
 
02:36:43.870 --> 02:36:43.880 align:start position:0%
skibby I did I did have just one
 
02:36:46.910 --> 02:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
question quickly and that is what
 
02:36:49.950 --> 02:36:49.960 align:start position:0%
level with most estate planning type
 
02:36:53.349 --> 02:36:53.359 align:start position:0%
documents there has to be at least
 
02:36:56.910 --> 02:36:56.920 align:start position:0%
some um level of competence in signing
 
02:36:59.710 --> 02:36:59.720 align:start position:0%
the document what level of competence
 
02:37:02.309 --> 02:37:02.319 align:start position:0%
would a person have to have in order to
 
02:37:05.309 --> 02:37:05.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:10.190 --> 02:37:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:12.950 --> 02:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
um let me just find the section Mr
 
02:37:12.960 --> 02:37:14.790 align:start position:0%
um let me just find the section Mr
chairman

02:37:14.790 --> 02:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
02:37:14.800 --> 02:37:17.110 align:start position:0%
chairman
um

02:37:17.110 --> 02:37:17.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:37:21.190 --> 02:37:21.200 align:start position:0%
I think that what I would refer to
 
02:37:21.200 --> 02:37:22.300 align:start position:0%
I think that what I would refer to
is

02:37:22.300 --> 02:37:22.310 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:37:22.310 --> 02:37:28.630 align:start position:0%
is
[Music]

02:37:28.630 --> 02:37:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:33.510 --> 02:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
um is on page five line four which is
 
02:37:35.349 --> 02:37:35.359 align:start position:0%
basically a continuation of the previous
 
02:37:37.710 --> 02:37:37.720 align:start position:0%
section which talks about the components
 
02:37:40.309 --> 02:37:40.319 align:start position:0%
of a valid agreement and the standard
 
02:37:42.630 --> 02:37:42.640 align:start position:0%
there is that each party to the
 
02:37:44.230 --> 02:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
agreement has signed the agreement
 
02:37:46.389 --> 02:37:46.399 align:start position:0%
voluntarily and with an understanding of
 
02:37:49.150 --> 02:37:49.160 align:start position:0%
the nature and effect of the agreement
 
02:37:51.469 --> 02:37:51.479 align:start position:0%
so there's I think that's the closest
 
02:37:53.790 --> 02:37:53.800 align:start position:0%
that the bill has to what you're getting
 
02:37:57.230 --> 02:37:57.240 align:start position:0%
at if if the person does not understand
 
02:37:58.910 --> 02:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
what it is that they're entering into
 
02:38:01.349 --> 02:38:01.359 align:start position:0%
then they the agreement that they enter
 
02:38:04.630 --> 02:38:04.640 align:start position:0%
into would not be valid um I think that
 
02:38:07.070 --> 02:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
there was not an attempt to try to
 
02:38:10.830 --> 02:38:10.840 align:start position:0%
Define some threshold of capacity in the
 
02:38:13.469 --> 02:38:13.479 align:start position:0%
same way that other areas of law do
 
02:38:15.990 --> 02:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
because I think the point is that there
 
02:38:18.190 --> 02:38:18.200 align:start position:0%
is a sort of dynamic relationship
 
02:38:22.070 --> 02:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
between the capacity um and you know
 
02:38:23.670 --> 02:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
collection of strengths and weaknesses
 
02:38:26.309 --> 02:38:26.319 align:start position:0%
that the person with disability may have
 
02:38:29.110 --> 02:38:29.120 align:start position:0%
and the type of support the intensity of
 
02:38:31.389 --> 02:38:31.399 align:start position:0%
that support the subject matter of the
 
02:38:33.510 --> 02:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
support um and the skills of the
 
02:38:35.670 --> 02:38:35.680 align:start position:0%
supporters that if if those mesh
 
02:38:37.590 --> 02:38:37.600 align:start position:0%
together I think there can be a range of
 
02:38:40.070 --> 02:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
capacity that would work for the person
 
02:38:41.190 --> 02:38:41.200 align:start position:0%
with a
 
02:38:43.070 --> 02:38:43.080 align:start position:0%
disability so long as they understand
 
02:38:44.190 --> 02:38:44.200 align:start position:0%
what they're getting
 
02:38:46.670 --> 02:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
into so and any we were talking about
 
02:38:50.550 --> 02:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
special education earlier but in um as I
 
02:38:53.590 --> 02:38:53.600 align:start position:0%
read the document it applies only to
 
02:38:56.630 --> 02:38:56.640 align:start position:0%
adults is that correct that's correct
 
02:39:01.590 --> 02:39:01.600 align:start position:0%
because the the the um you know the a
 
02:39:04.070 --> 02:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
minor does not have the sort of
 
02:39:07.590 --> 02:39:07.600 align:start position:0%
authority that um would be taken away by
 
02:39:10.190 --> 02:39:10.200 align:start position:0%
a guardianship they they basically are
 
02:39:12.070 --> 02:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
under guardianship until age 18 by
 
02:39:15.110 --> 02:39:15.120 align:start position:0%
virtue of their parents right and I
 
02:39:19.870 --> 02:39:19.880 align:start position:0%
guess the the last question I have is um
 
02:39:22.750 --> 02:39:22.760 align:start position:0%
so I'm a I'm a doctor and somebody shows
 
02:39:26.670 --> 02:39:26.680 align:start position:0%
up and they have this type of an
 
02:39:30.469 --> 02:39:30.479 align:start position:0%
agreement um so and my concern is to
 
02:39:32.830 --> 02:39:32.840 align:start position:0%
what extent can I rely on the agreement
 
02:39:32.840 --> 02:39:34.070 align:start position:0%
what extent can I rely on the agreement
I

02:39:34.070 --> 02:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
I
 
02:39:37.269 --> 02:39:37.279 align:start position:0%
guess I really all I
 
02:39:39.950 --> 02:39:39.960 align:start position:0%
can all I can really do is a do I can't
 
02:39:44.550 --> 02:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
really rely on the the support person
 
02:39:47.309 --> 02:39:47.319 align:start position:0%
based upon this because ultimately it's
 
02:39:50.710 --> 02:39:50.720 align:start position:0%
the decision of the person who entered
 
02:39:53.269 --> 02:39:53.279 align:start position:0%
into the agreement the principal in the
 
02:39:56.550 --> 02:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
agreement and I can't really rely on
 
02:39:58.790 --> 02:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
what the supporter might tell me to do
 
02:40:01.349 --> 02:40:01.359 align:start position:0%
like a power of
 
02:40:03.830 --> 02:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
attorney well I think that's right but I
 
02:40:05.910 --> 02:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
think it's important to emphasize that I
 
02:40:08.190 --> 02:40:08.200 align:start position:0%
mean this this makes no change in terms
 
02:40:11.389 --> 02:40:11.399 align:start position:0%
of the sort of legal Authority I mean if
 
02:40:13.309 --> 02:40:13.319 align:start position:0%
someone is not under guardianship then
 
02:40:16.790 --> 02:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
it's the patient the adult patient who
 
02:40:18.510 --> 02:40:18.520 align:start position:0%
is in the driver's seat when it comes to
 
02:40:20.710 --> 02:40:20.720 align:start position:0%
healthcare decisions or you know there's
 
02:40:22.910 --> 02:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
analogies in in many other subject areas
 
02:40:25.309 --> 02:40:25.319 align:start position:0%
as well and I think what the what this
 
02:40:27.349 --> 02:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
law would do would be to recognize that
 
02:40:29.990 --> 02:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
there are some people who need support
 
02:40:33.670 --> 02:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
of one type or another to be able to
 
02:40:36.030 --> 02:40:36.040 align:start position:0%
make informed decisions and to
 
02:40:38.429 --> 02:40:38.439 align:start position:0%
communicate those decisions I it may be
 
02:40:40.150 --> 02:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
an inadequate analogy but I think it may
 
02:40:43.309 --> 02:40:43.319 align:start position:0%
be helpful is um just as someone who
 
02:40:46.309 --> 02:40:46.319 align:start position:0%
uses a sign language interpreter sitting
 
02:40:48.590 --> 02:40:48.600 align:start position:0%
in the doctor's office the doctor may
 
02:40:52.030 --> 02:40:52.040 align:start position:0%
not be able to discern directly what the
 
02:40:54.150 --> 02:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
what the wishes of the princi of the
 
02:40:56.150 --> 02:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
patient are but through the use of an
 
02:40:58.469 --> 02:40:58.479 align:start position:0%
interpreter they are able to discern and
 
02:41:01.269 --> 02:41:01.279 align:start position:0%
their responsibility to conform to the
 
02:41:04.750 --> 02:41:04.760 align:start position:0%
wishes of their patient um remains even
 
02:41:06.630 --> 02:41:06.640 align:start position:0%
though there may be a different way of
 
02:41:09.590 --> 02:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
communicating uh with the patient thank
 
02:41:12.830 --> 02:41:12.840 align:start position:0%
you any other questions seeing none
 
02:41:14.550 --> 02:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony today thank
 
02:41:14.560 --> 02:41:16.150 align:start position:0%

02:41:28.030 --> 02:41:28.040 align:start position:0%
testify and the Sheila Zachary I don't
 
02:41:35.510 --> 02:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:40.230 --> 02:41:40.240 align:start position:0%
correctly um I am here I just unmuted my
 
02:41:43.389 --> 02:41:43.399 align:start position:0%
microphone can everyone hear me we can
 
02:41:46.750 --> 02:41:46.760 align:start position:0%
okay thanks um I did did provide written
 
02:41:49.790 --> 02:41:49.800 align:start position:0%
testimony um as um as representative
 
02:41:53.269 --> 02:41:53.279 align:start position:0%
Smith stated and I'll I'll go through um
 
02:41:55.670 --> 02:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
that testimony so that you get if you
 
02:41:58.710 --> 02:41:58.720 align:start position:0%
didn't have the opportunity to to read
 
02:42:01.510 --> 02:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
what I sent over to the um committee you
 
02:42:03.630 --> 02:42:03.640 align:start position:0%
you can get the get the understanding I
 
02:42:06.110 --> 02:42:06.120 align:start position:0%
think of of uh the comments that
 
02:42:08.389 --> 02:42:08.399 align:start position:0%
representative Smith said and then I
 
02:42:11.150 --> 02:42:11.160 align:start position:0%
don't want to take too much time but um
 
02:42:12.990 --> 02:42:13.000 align:start position:0%
I I do want to just give you my
 
02:42:14.670 --> 02:42:14.680 align:start position:0%
perspective as a member of the public
 
02:42:17.870 --> 02:42:17.880 align:start position:0%
and as an attorney who has um sat many
 
02:42:20.230 --> 02:42:20.240 align:start position:0%
times with families to discuss
 
02:42:22.150 --> 02:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
guardianship versus alternatives to
 
02:42:24.590 --> 02:42:24.600 align:start position:0%
guardianship as well as sitting in in
 
02:42:26.349 --> 02:42:26.359 align:start position:0%
special education meetings kind of what
 
02:42:29.590 --> 02:42:29.600 align:start position:0%
really happens um from a from my own
 
02:42:32.910 --> 02:42:32.920 align:start position:0%
from my own experience um good morning
 
02:42:35.429 --> 02:42:35.439 align:start position:0%
and thank you for accepting my comments
 
02:42:38.990 --> 02:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
regarding HB 540 a bill regarding
 
02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:40.150 align:start position:0%
regarding HB 540 a bill regarding
supported

02:42:40.150 --> 02:42:40.160 align:start position:0%
supported
 
02:42:42.389 --> 02:42:42.399 align:start position:0%
decisionmaking my interest in this
 
02:42:45.429 --> 02:42:45.439 align:start position:0%
legislation is manifold I was born with
 
02:42:48.309 --> 02:42:48.319 align:start position:0%
a significant visual disability in 1958
 
02:42:49.870 --> 02:42:49.880 align:start position:0%
so I'm in my 60s I've a lot of
 
02:42:51.590 --> 02:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
experience with this and I've had
 
02:42:53.590 --> 02:42:53.600 align:start position:0%
lifelong experience with the ways in
 
02:42:55.389 --> 02:42:55.399 align:start position:0%
which people with disabilities are
 
02:42:57.309 --> 02:42:57.319 align:start position:0%
treated differently from individuals
 
02:42:59.389 --> 02:42:59.399 align:start position:0%
without disabilities sometimes
 
02:43:02.429 --> 02:43:02.439 align:start position:0%
inadvertently or with beneficient
 
02:43:04.670 --> 02:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
attention I have been an attorney for
 
02:43:06.790 --> 02:43:06.800 align:start position:0%
over three decades which includes over a
 
02:43:09.389 --> 02:43:09.399 align:start position:0%
decade as a former staff attorney at the
 
02:43:11.070 --> 02:43:11.080 align:start position:0%
disabilities rights Center in Conquer
 
02:43:13.429 --> 02:43:13.439 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and currently I have a
 
02:43:15.710 --> 02:43:15.720 align:start position:0%
private law practice that specialized in
 
02:43:17.870 --> 02:43:17.880 align:start position:0%
a wide range of legal issues affecting
 
02:43:20.349 --> 02:43:20.359 align:start position:0%
people with disabilities and the senior
 
02:43:23.309 --> 02:43:23.319 align:start position:0%
population including discrimination
 
02:43:26.269 --> 02:43:26.279 align:start position:0%
Estate Planning in the event of future
 
02:43:28.389 --> 02:43:28.399 align:start position:0%
disability and
 
02:43:31.030 --> 02:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
guardianship I am also the parent of an
 
02:43:33.870 --> 02:43:33.880 align:start position:0%
adult with a developmental disability
 
02:43:36.710 --> 02:43:36.720 align:start position:0%
who is not under guardianship who lives
 
02:43:38.950 --> 02:43:38.960 align:start position:0%
independently and works in conquered and
 
02:43:41.429 --> 02:43:41.439 align:start position:0%
he's also a client he on the
 
02:43:43.670 --> 02:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities uh
 
02:43:47.550 --> 02:43:47.560 align:start position:0%
waiver however what most informs my
 
02:43:50.030 --> 02:43:50.040 align:start position:0%
understanding of the issues facing
 
02:43:53.670 --> 02:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
people with disabilities is my firsthand
 
02:43:57.790 --> 02:43:57.800 align:start position:0%
experience that being said I was put off
 
02:44:00.269 --> 02:44:00.279 align:start position:0%
by language in this proposed
 
02:44:02.389 --> 02:44:02.399 align:start position:0%
legislation the purpose of this
 
02:44:05.269 --> 02:44:05.279 align:start position:0%
legislation is to provide an alternative
 
02:44:05.279 --> 02:44:06.389 align:start position:0%
legislation is to provide an alternative
to

02:44:06.389 --> 02:44:06.399 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:44:09.070 --> 02:44:09.080 align:start position:0%
guardianship I support that
 
02:44:12.830 --> 02:44:12.840 align:start position:0%
purpose however right at the outset the
 
02:44:16.830 --> 02:44:16.840 align:start position:0%
statement of findings makes over broad
 
02:44:20.389 --> 02:44:20.399 align:start position:0%
inaccurate and untrue statements about
 
02:44:23.870 --> 02:44:23.880 align:start position:0%
persons with disabilities generally the
 
02:44:27.389 --> 02:44:27.399 align:start position:0%
group it purports to help for example
 
02:44:29.590 --> 02:44:29.600 align:start position:0%
under the statement of findings
 
02:44:35.070 --> 02:44:35.080 align:start position:0%
paragraph two reads quote most people
 
02:44:37.469 --> 02:44:37.479 align:start position:0%
with disabilities have the ability to
 
02:44:41.150 --> 02:44:41.160 align:start position:0%
make decisions for themselves when they
 
02:44:43.910 --> 02:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
are provided the necessary information
 
02:44:46.870 --> 02:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
and support to to do
 
02:44:49.990 --> 02:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
so and in my written testimony I I
 
02:44:52.630 --> 02:44:52.640 align:start position:0%
italicized the phrase when they are
 
02:44:54.990 --> 02:44:55.000 align:start position:0%
provided the necessary information and
 
02:44:58.309 --> 02:44:58.319 align:start position:0%
support to do so this perpetuates a
 
02:45:00.469 --> 02:45:00.479 align:start position:0%
negative and untrue view of people with
 
02:45:03.550 --> 02:45:03.560 align:start position:0%
disabilities as being less competent and
 
02:45:05.830 --> 02:45:05.840 align:start position:0%
less capable generally than people
 
02:45:08.349 --> 02:45:08.359 align:start position:0%
without disabilities because of that
 
02:45:10.469 --> 02:45:10.479 align:start position:0%
qualifier that they can only make
 
02:45:13.190 --> 02:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
decisions when they are provided by
 
02:45:15.630 --> 02:45:15.640 align:start position:0%
someone else the necessary information
 
02:45:15.640 --> 02:45:16.349 align:start position:0%
someone else the necessary information
and

02:45:16.349 --> 02:45:16.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:45:19.230 --> 02:45:19.240 align:start position:0%
support the flip side of this are
 
02:45:22.670 --> 02:45:22.680 align:start position:0%
those backhanded compliments such as you
 
02:45:26.190 --> 02:45:26.200 align:start position:0%
do very well or I don't think of you as
 
02:45:29.309 --> 02:45:29.319 align:start position:0%
disabled that have been directed to me
 
02:45:31.750 --> 02:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
by professionals and colleagues and I
 
02:45:35.110 --> 02:45:35.120 align:start position:0%
don't think that I am alone as being the
 
02:45:35.120 --> 02:45:36.349 align:start position:0%
don't think that I am alone as being the
subject

02:45:36.349 --> 02:45:36.359 align:start position:0%
subject
 
02:45:39.269 --> 02:45:39.279 align:start position:0%
of the people who have said such things
 
02:45:41.670 --> 02:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
to me are well-meaning but the
 
02:45:43.670 --> 02:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
underlying assumption is of course that
 
02:45:45.710 --> 02:45:45.720 align:start position:0%
I shouldn't be doing that well solely
 
02:45:47.389 --> 02:45:47.399 align:start position:0%
because I have a
 
02:45:51.030 --> 02:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
disability so getting back to the
 
02:45:54.190 --> 02:45:54.200 align:start position:0%
statement of findings I suggest that you
 
02:45:58.309 --> 02:45:58.319 align:start position:0%
substitute the word women for the phrase
 
02:46:01.429 --> 02:46:01.439 align:start position:0%
people with disabilities and see how you
 
02:46:03.469 --> 02:46:03.479 align:start position:0%
would like it if the statement of
 
02:46:07.309 --> 02:46:07.319 align:start position:0%
findings read most women have the
 
02:46:09.710 --> 02:46:09.720 align:start position:0%
ability to make decisions for themselves
 
02:46:11.910 --> 02:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
when they are provided the necessary
 
02:46:15.309 --> 02:46:15.319 align:start position:0%
information and support to do so I think
 
02:46:17.510 --> 02:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of women and men would find the
 
02:46:20.349 --> 02:46:20.359 align:start position:0%
Assumption insulting because it assumes
 
02:46:22.469 --> 02:46:22.479 align:start position:0%
that men have the ability to make
 
02:46:24.550 --> 02:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
decisions for themselves without the
 
02:46:26.790 --> 02:46:26.800 align:start position:0%
support of someone else but most women
 
02:46:29.150 --> 02:46:29.160 align:start position:0%
could make those decisions with that
 
02:46:29.160 --> 02:46:30.790 align:start position:0%
could make those decisions with that
additional

02:46:30.790 --> 02:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
additional
 
02:46:33.870 --> 02:46:33.880 align:start position:0%
support um look at statement of findings
 
02:46:37.349 --> 02:46:37.359 align:start position:0%
paragraph three quote trusted friends
 
02:46:39.389 --> 02:46:39.399 align:start position:0%
family members and professionals can
 
02:46:41.150 --> 02:46:41.160 align:start position:0%
help people with
 
02:46:43.389 --> 02:46:43.399 align:start position:0%
disabilities understand the choices they
 
02:46:45.510 --> 02:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
have and how to live their life
 
02:46:48.670 --> 02:46:48.680 align:start position:0%
lives again the Assumption underneath
 
02:46:50.830 --> 02:46:50.840 align:start position:0%
the statement is that first trusted
 
02:46:53.750 --> 02:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
friends family members and professionals
 
02:46:56.110 --> 02:46:56.120 align:start position:0%
would not be people with disabilities
 
02:46:59.150 --> 02:46:59.160 align:start position:0%
and second that we who have disabilities
 
02:47:02.510 --> 02:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
need these people to help understand the
 
02:47:05.309 --> 02:47:05.319 align:start position:0%
choices we have and how to live our
 
02:47:08.950 --> 02:47:08.960 align:start position:0%
lives again sub for the term people with
 
02:47:11.710 --> 02:47:11.720 align:start position:0%
disabilities and see how you like this
 
02:47:14.389 --> 02:47:14.399 align:start position:0%
wording trusted friends family members
 
02:47:16.550 --> 02:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
and profess profs can help women
 
02:47:17.950 --> 02:47:17.960 align:start position:0%
understand the choices they have and how
 
02:47:21.309 --> 02:47:21.319 align:start position:0%
to live their lives that sounds pretty
 
02:47:24.550 --> 02:47:24.560 align:start position:0%
paternalistic um I I also suggest in
 
02:47:27.349 --> 02:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
paragraph four um if you were to
 
02:47:30.469 --> 02:47:30.479 align:start position:0%
substitute the word woman or women for
 
02:47:32.950 --> 02:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
the phrase adults with disabilities so
 
02:47:35.269 --> 02:47:35.279 align:start position:0%
that the sentence read women have a
 
02:47:37.870 --> 02:47:37.880 align:start position:0%
range of strengths exper and experiences
 
02:47:39.790 --> 02:47:39.800 align:start position:0%
and guardianship is unnecessarily
 
02:47:41.230 --> 02:47:41.240 align:start position:0%
restrictive in many of these
 
02:47:43.550 --> 02:47:43.560 align:start position:0%
circumstances um it kind of hearkens
 
02:47:46.230 --> 02:47:46.240 align:start position:0%
back to perhaps a 19th Century view of
 
02:47:47.830 --> 02:47:47.840 align:start position:0%
women is needing to be under the
 
02:47:50.190 --> 02:47:50.200 align:start position:0%
protection of men but obviously they
 
02:47:52.870 --> 02:47:52.880 align:start position:0%
don't need to be um so I think that if
 
02:47:54.790 --> 02:47:54.800 align:start position:0%
you compare if you kind of Simply
 
02:47:57.190 --> 02:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
substitute some language i' suggest that
 
02:47:58.870 --> 02:47:58.880 align:start position:0%
you might find other places in the
 
02:48:00.870 --> 02:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
proposed Bill where the term person with
 
02:48:03.910 --> 02:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
a disability is not inappro is not
 
02:48:06.309 --> 02:48:06.319 align:start position:0%
appropriately limited to the class of
 
02:48:08.349 --> 02:48:08.359 align:start position:0%
people that this legislation
 
02:48:10.910 --> 02:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
addresses um I.E those who might be
 
02:48:12.110 --> 02:48:12.120 align:start position:0%
subject to a
 
02:48:15.150 --> 02:48:15.160 align:start position:0%
guardianship um in some the state of
 
02:48:18.230 --> 02:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
findings that is proposed is overly
 
02:48:20.750 --> 02:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
Broad and perhaps
 
02:48:23.110 --> 02:48:23.120 align:start position:0%
inadvertently perpetuates a negative
 
02:48:25.990 --> 02:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
view of all persons with disabilities
 
02:48:28.790 --> 02:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
most of whom have never been nor will be
 
02:48:30.510 --> 02:48:30.520 align:start position:0%
the subject of a
 
02:48:34.309 --> 02:48:34.319 align:start position:0%
guardianship so I have a suggestion by
 
02:48:37.070 --> 02:48:37.080 align:start position:0%
amending the legislation to eliminate
 
02:48:39.790 --> 02:48:39.800 align:start position:0%
paragraphs 1-4 in the statement of
 
02:48:44.550 --> 02:48:44.560 align:start position:0%
findings reum renumbering paragraphs 5
 
02:48:48.309 --> 02:48:48.319 align:start position:0%
through through eight as 1 through 4 and
 
02:48:52.790 --> 02:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
adding in paragraphs 6 and 8 the words
 
02:48:55.469 --> 02:48:55.479 align:start position:0%
who might otherwise be subject to
 
02:48:58.349 --> 02:48:58.359 align:start position:0%
guardianship after the phrase person
 
02:49:01.150 --> 02:49:01.160 align:start position:0%
with a disability you will eliminate
 
02:49:03.750 --> 02:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
this over Brad and and inaccurate
 
02:49:05.710 --> 02:49:05.720 align:start position:0%
depiction of people with disabilities as
 
02:49:09.590 --> 02:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
a group and better serve the Bill's
 
02:49:13.429 --> 02:49:13.439 align:start position:0%
purpose so that concludes my my um my
 
02:49:15.670 --> 02:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
written testimony
 
02:49:18.309 --> 02:49:18.319 align:start position:0%
and I just wanted to say that with
 
02:49:21.590 --> 02:49:21.600 align:start position:0%
regard generally to um to supported
 
02:49:24.590 --> 02:49:24.600 align:start position:0%
decision making of um I'm I've been
 
02:49:26.429 --> 02:49:26.439 align:start position:0%
familiar with with this for a while I
 
02:49:28.349 --> 02:49:28.359 align:start position:0%
tell I tell my clients that it's not
 
02:49:32.309 --> 02:49:32.319 align:start position:0%
here it has not yet been um um passed in
 
02:49:35.070 --> 02:49:35.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I was asked by the um
 
02:49:36.830 --> 02:49:36.840 align:start position:0%
family of law section of the American
 
02:49:39.990 --> 02:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
Bar Association to contribute a piece um
 
02:49:44.469 --> 02:49:44.479 align:start position:0%
to their um their Journal um a year or
 
02:49:47.550 --> 02:49:47.560 align:start position:0%
so ago um about guardianship and its
 
02:49:50.750 --> 02:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
Alternatives and um and I I mentioned
 
02:49:54.309 --> 02:49:54.319 align:start position:0%
that this is a Hot Topic because the ABA
 
02:49:57.590 --> 02:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
has um has adopted a provision
 
02:50:00.070 --> 02:50:00.080 align:start position:0%
supporting supported decisionmaking as
 
02:50:03.110 --> 02:50:03.120 align:start position:0%
an alternative to guardianship but you
 
02:50:06.590 --> 02:50:06.600 align:start position:0%
know in my in my in my own practice and
 
02:50:10.510 --> 02:50:10.520 align:start position:0%
experience um I think the the real issue
 
02:50:14.150 --> 02:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
is is changing what guardianship is so
 
02:50:16.950 --> 02:50:16.960 align:start position:0%
Guardian ship and the guardian sees him
 
02:50:19.910 --> 02:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
or herself as more of a mentor because
 
02:50:22.870 --> 02:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
as attorney Skiby stated the reality
 
02:50:24.750 --> 02:50:24.760 align:start position:0%
with supported decision-making and I
 
02:50:26.110 --> 02:50:26.120 align:start position:0%
don't I don't really take a position on
 
02:50:28.349 --> 02:50:28.359 align:start position:0%
this field one way or the other but the
 
02:50:30.150 --> 02:50:30.160 align:start position:0%
re but my first reaction when I first
 
02:50:31.710 --> 02:50:31.720 align:start position:0%
learned of this concept A couple of
 
02:50:33.790 --> 02:50:33.800 align:start position:0%
years ago was was was well that's what
 
02:50:35.830 --> 02:50:35.840 align:start position:0%
people are doing already you know if
 
02:50:37.429 --> 02:50:37.439 align:start position:0%
you've got a family member and you have
 
02:50:39.790 --> 02:50:39.800 align:start position:0%
a disability and you need certain
 
02:50:42.429 --> 02:50:42.439 align:start position:0%
assistance such as my son who is now in
 
02:50:45.070 --> 02:50:45.080 align:start position:0%
his 30s um we're doing doing that
 
02:50:50.070 --> 02:50:50.080 align:start position:0%
already and um and I we don't and he has
 
02:50:51.750 --> 02:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
powers of attorney which is another
 
02:50:54.670 --> 02:50:54.680 align:start position:0%
alternative um so if I need to do
 
02:50:57.389 --> 02:50:57.399 align:start position:0%
something in consult with him as his
 
02:51:00.910 --> 02:51:00.920 align:start position:0%
agent I can do that he has not lost any
 
02:51:04.269 --> 02:51:04.279 align:start position:0%
P any any rights of his own um in the
 
02:51:07.389 --> 02:51:07.399 align:start position:0%
educational context I don't know if it
 
02:51:10.950 --> 02:51:10.960 align:start position:0%
was mentioned but typically what schools
 
02:51:15.070 --> 02:51:15.080 align:start position:0%
will accept for a child who is 18 at
 
02:51:19.229 --> 02:51:19.239 align:start position:0%
which time in special education the um
 
02:51:22.150 --> 02:51:22.160 align:start position:0%
the um rights that the parent has
 
02:51:24.710 --> 02:51:24.720 align:start position:0%
automatically transferred to the child
 
02:51:27.750 --> 02:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
is an educational power of attorney and
 
02:51:30.110 --> 02:51:30.120 align:start position:0%
I draft these all the time for my
 
02:51:32.349 --> 02:51:32.359 align:start position:0%
clients as I believe other attorneys may
 
02:51:34.630 --> 02:51:34.640 align:start position:0%
do as well and basically what that is
 
02:51:36.870 --> 02:51:36.880 align:start position:0%
it's a general P it's a it's it's your
 
02:51:40.550 --> 02:51:40.560 align:start position:0%
general power of attorney um with with
 
02:51:42.469 --> 02:51:42.479 align:start position:0%
which includes educational Powers so
 
02:51:45.190 --> 02:51:45.200 align:start position:0%
again the child is is able who make any
 
02:51:47.389 --> 02:51:47.399 align:start position:0%
decisions that he or she may want to
 
02:51:51.229 --> 02:51:51.239 align:start position:0%
make with um in terms of education but
 
02:51:53.190 --> 02:51:53.200 align:start position:0%
it also gives the child the option of
 
02:51:55.269 --> 02:51:55.279 align:start position:0%
saying well you know I don't want to go
 
02:51:57.990 --> 02:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
to that meeting my parent can go you
 
02:51:59.990 --> 02:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
know um and believe me there's a lot of
 
02:52:01.590 --> 02:52:01.600 align:start position:0%
kids who don't want to go to their I
 
02:52:03.030 --> 02:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
meetings there's a lot of parents who
 
02:52:04.429 --> 02:52:04.439 align:start position:0%
don't want to go to the IP meetings
 
02:52:08.229 --> 02:52:08.239 align:start position:0%
either um and so so um so again you know
 
02:52:10.150 --> 02:52:10.160 align:start position:0%
and thinking about alternatives to
 
02:52:12.630 --> 02:52:12.640 align:start position:0%
guardianship for for people perhaps it's
 
02:52:14.710 --> 02:52:14.720 align:start position:0%
not this is not the uh this is this is
 
02:52:16.229 --> 02:52:16.239 align:start position:0%
not going to be the time for it but I
 
02:52:18.590 --> 02:52:18.600 align:start position:0%
really think that the the issue is more
 
02:52:20.790 --> 02:52:20.800 align:start position:0%
you know making is changing the nature
 
02:52:23.670 --> 02:52:23.680 align:start position:0%
of guardianship making the guardian if
 
02:52:25.990 --> 02:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
court appointed someone who becomes more
 
02:52:28.150 --> 02:52:28.160 align:start position:0%
of a mentor and is understood that way
 
02:52:30.590 --> 02:52:30.600 align:start position:0%
as opposed to somebody who basically can
 
02:52:33.429 --> 02:52:33.439 align:start position:0%
overrule the decision of the person who
 
02:52:36.950 --> 02:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
has the disability um so I think that's
 
02:52:40.469 --> 02:52:40.479 align:start position:0%
all I have to say um I'm certainly happy
 
02:52:42.710 --> 02:52:42.720 align:start position:0%
if anyone has any questions about my
 
02:52:45.070 --> 02:52:45.080 align:start position:0%
perspective or disagrees or agrees with
 
02:52:46.950 --> 02:52:46.960 align:start position:0%
my perspective or has any questions
 
02:52:50.750 --> 02:52:50.760 align:start position:0%
generally about my own experience um as
 
02:52:53.590 --> 02:52:53.600 align:start position:0%
um as a a parent of a CH of of an adult
 
02:52:55.429 --> 02:52:55.439 align:start position:0%
who has a disability um or the
 
02:52:57.469 --> 02:52:57.479 align:start position:0%
guardianship I've I've represented many
 
02:53:00.389 --> 02:53:00.399 align:start position:0%

last 30 years and um' be happy if

there's anything that I can say that
 
02:53:09.349 --> 02:53:09.359 align:start position:0%
might help you make your decisions on
 
02:53:11.469 --> 02:53:11.479 align:start position:0%

speaking as a private citizen but I also
 
02:53:52.790 --> 02:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
work at a Statewide organization that
 
02:53:54.590 --> 02:53:54.600 align:start position:0%
helps families who are trying to find
 
02:53:56.389 --> 02:53:56.399 align:start position:0%

opportunity to talk to you about House
 
02:54:07.389 --> 02:54:07.399 align:start position:0%
Bill 540 I'm here to share information
 
02:54:09.510 --> 02:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
that I've learned both as a parent and
 
02:54:11.910 --> 02:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
as a person working with other families
 
02:54:13.469 --> 02:54:13.479 align:start position:0%
my experience includes being the
 
02:54:15.910 --> 02:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
guardian of my 40-year-old son for the
 
02:54:18.349 --> 02:54:18.359 align:start position:0%
past 22 years and involvement in
 
02:54:21.190 --> 02:54:21.200 align:start position:0%
guardianship proceedings for my father I
 
02:54:24.830 --> 02:54:24.840 align:start position:0%
also provided input to the um writing of
 
02:54:28.150 --> 02:54:28.160 align:start position:0%
house spill 540 filing for guardianship
 
02:54:30.710 --> 02:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
was and is a difficult and emotional
 
02:54:33.070 --> 02:54:33.080 align:start position:0%
process it's yet another time when I had
 
02:54:35.630 --> 02:54:35.640 align:start position:0%
to face the reality of what my son
 
02:54:38.550 --> 02:54:38.560 align:start position:0%
couldn't do it's not something anyone
 
02:54:41.150 --> 02:54:41.160 align:start position:0%
anyone looks forward to families who ask
 
02:54:43.229 --> 02:54:43.239 align:start position:0%
me about guardianship frequently ask if
 
02:54:44.990 --> 02:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
there are other options
 
02:54:47.070 --> 02:54:47.080 align:start position:0%
they say things like do I have to do
 
02:54:49.950 --> 02:54:49.960 align:start position:0%
this he's working really hard to become
 
02:54:53.229 --> 02:54:53.239 align:start position:0%
more independent he's still
 
02:54:55.469 --> 02:54:55.479 align:start position:0%
learning I tell them that our current
 
02:54:58.269 --> 02:54:58.279 align:start position:0%
system allows for guardianship or things
 
02:55:00.110 --> 02:55:00.120 align:start position:0%
like power of attorney or healthc care
 
02:55:03.510 --> 02:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
proxy that's what we currently have most
 
02:55:05.429 --> 02:55:05.439 align:start position:0%
people have some familiarity with those
 
02:55:07.469 --> 02:55:07.479 align:start position:0%
options but they don't really feel like
 
02:55:10.830 --> 02:55:10.840 align:start position:0%
they meet their needs guardianship is
 
02:55:13.110 --> 02:55:13.120 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the choice most families
 
02:55:14.790 --> 02:55:14.800 align:start position:0%
make with a lot of
 
02:55:16.870 --> 02:55:16.880 align:start position:0%
reluctance as parents we don't want to
 
02:55:19.550 --> 02:55:19.560 align:start position:0%
stand up in court in front of our child
 
02:55:21.750 --> 02:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
because it is expected that that young
 
02:55:23.990 --> 02:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
person be in the court and talk about
 
02:55:25.950 --> 02:55:25.960 align:start position:0%
all their deficiencies and the labels
 
02:55:28.150 --> 02:55:28.160 align:start position:0%
that they've received over the years in
 
02:55:29.990 --> 02:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
order to gain guardianship so that we
 
02:55:31.790 --> 02:55:31.800 align:start position:0%
can continue to support them and help
 
02:55:34.110 --> 02:55:34.120 align:start position:0%
them we want to be building up their
 
02:55:36.229 --> 02:55:36.239 align:start position:0%
self-esteem we want to be telling others
 
02:55:37.710 --> 02:55:37.720 align:start position:0%
about all the great gains that we've
 
02:55:39.510 --> 02:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
seen and what we think can be
 
02:55:42.070 --> 02:55:42.080 align:start position:0%
accomplished with a little more time how
 
02:55:43.630 --> 02:55:43.640 align:start position:0%
they're going to be able to do great
 
02:55:46.670 --> 02:55:46.680 align:start position:0%
things rather than doing the negative
 
02:55:49.229 --> 02:55:49.239 align:start position:0%
talk especially when we continue to see
 
02:55:51.910 --> 02:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
them gaining skills and making progress
 
02:55:54.110 --> 02:55:54.120 align:start position:0%
we're not being unrealistic we're still
 
02:55:54.120 --> 02:55:54.910 align:start position:0%
we're not being unrealistic we're still
being

02:55:54.910 --> 02:55:54.920 align:start position:0%
being
 
02:55:57.710 --> 02:55:57.720 align:start position:0%
hopeful however we're also being told
 
02:55:59.910 --> 02:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
that we will have no input once the
 
02:56:02.710 --> 02:56:02.720 align:start position:0%
young person reaches 18 if we don't have
 
02:56:04.870 --> 02:56:04.880 align:start position:0%
guardianship schools are unaware of
 
02:56:07.950 --> 02:56:07.960 align:start position:0%
other options Banks lawyers doctors have
 
02:56:10.190 --> 02:56:10.200 align:start position:0%
all been taught that as of 18 the
 
02:56:12.309 --> 02:56:12.319 align:start position:0%
individual makes all their own decisions
 
02:56:15.190 --> 02:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
unless you have guardianship
 
02:56:16.990 --> 02:56:17.000 align:start position:0%
families are seeking options that will
 
02:56:19.030 --> 02:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
help their young person to continue to
 
02:56:20.910 --> 02:56:20.920 align:start position:0%
gain the skills they need to take care
 
02:56:23.030 --> 02:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
of themselves without taking away their
 
02:56:24.950 --> 02:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
individual rights supported
 
02:56:27.030 --> 02:56:27.040 align:start position:0%
decision-making is a tool to assist the
 
02:56:29.269 --> 02:56:29.279 align:start position:0%
young person and the family it allows
 
02:56:30.670 --> 02:56:30.680 align:start position:0%
the young person to maintain their
 
02:56:33.389 --> 02:56:33.399 align:start position:0%
ability to make their own decisions and
 
02:56:35.510 --> 02:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
it gives the family knowledge that a
 
02:56:38.349 --> 02:56:38.359 align:start position:0%
plan is in place to support that family
 
02:56:40.469 --> 02:56:40.479 align:start position:0%
member if families have provided
 
02:56:42.990 --> 02:56:43.000 align:start position:0%
information on options at schools and
 
02:56:44.269 --> 02:56:44.279 align:start position:0%
places where our kids are getting
 
02:56:46.750 --> 02:56:46.760 align:start position:0%
Services we can make informed decisions
 
02:56:48.710 --> 02:56:48.720 align:start position:0%
together about the option that is best
 
02:56:50.590 --> 02:56:50.600 align:start position:0%
suited for our family
 
02:56:52.670 --> 02:56:52.680 align:start position:0%
circumstances I learned about supported
 
02:56:54.710 --> 02:56:54.720 align:start position:0%
decision- making about four years ago
 
02:56:56.309 --> 02:56:56.319 align:start position:0%
and I've talked to families about it as
 
02:56:58.630 --> 02:56:58.640 align:start position:0%
an option however because it's not
 
02:57:01.510 --> 02:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
recognized by the New Hampshire um
 
02:57:03.830 --> 02:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
legislation and the courts they feel
 
02:57:05.750 --> 02:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
that it might not be acknowledged when
 
02:57:08.030 --> 02:57:08.040 align:start position:0%
they're working with others um in their
 
02:57:10.429 --> 02:57:10.439 align:start position:0%
young person's life and it's scary to do
 
02:57:12.070 --> 02:57:12.080 align:start position:0%
something that's different if you're not
 
02:57:14.590 --> 02:57:14.600 align:start position:0%
sure it's going to have validity
 
02:57:16.550 --> 02:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
to the Professionals in their lives how
 
02:57:17.950 --> 02:57:17.960 align:start position:0%
much push back are you going to get are
 
02:57:19.309 --> 02:57:19.319 align:start position:0%
you going to have to constantly be
 
02:57:21.790 --> 02:57:21.800 align:start position:0%
explaining and um and trying to make
 
02:57:25.389 --> 02:57:25.399 align:start position:0%
your point we're tired it becomes one
 
02:57:27.070 --> 02:57:27.080 align:start position:0%
more thing to explain and depending on
 
02:57:29.190 --> 02:57:29.200 align:start position:0%
your relationship with others it can be
 
02:57:30.990 --> 02:57:31.000 align:start position:0%
difficult to have the acknowledgement
 
02:57:32.950 --> 02:57:32.960 align:start position:0%
that more than one person may need to be
 
02:57:34.630 --> 02:57:34.640 align:start position:0%
involved in this decision-
 
02:57:37.150 --> 02:57:37.160 align:start position:0%
making professionals who may have never
 
02:57:39.469 --> 02:57:39.479 align:start position:0%
heard of sported decis are the ones
 
02:57:41.150 --> 02:57:41.160 align:start position:0%
telling that telling you that you have
 
02:57:43.389 --> 02:57:43.399 align:start position:0%
to file for guardianship it's how you
 
02:57:45.710 --> 02:57:45.720 align:start position:0%
protect your loved one we do want to
 
02:57:47.870 --> 02:57:47.880 align:start position:0%
protect our kids we also want them to
 
02:57:50.269 --> 02:57:50.279 align:start position:0%
gain more and more Independence families
 
02:57:52.309 --> 02:57:52.319 align:start position:0%
are conflicted and I certainly
 
02:57:54.389 --> 02:57:54.399 align:start position:0%
understand those concerns I ask that
 
02:57:57.309 --> 02:57:57.319 align:start position:0%
whatever you decide that you remember
 
02:57:59.830 --> 02:57:59.840 align:start position:0%
it's a difficult process and families
 
02:58:02.269 --> 02:58:02.279 align:start position:0%
want to continue to be involved thank
 
02:58:04.550 --> 02:58:04.560 align:start position:0%
you and I'm happy to take questions
 
02:58:06.110 --> 02:58:06.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
02:58:09.309 --> 02:58:09.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:11.830 --> 02:58:11.840 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none again thank you
 
02:58:14.830 --> 02:58:14.840 align:start position:0%

02:58:18.309 --> 02:58:18.319 align:start position:0%
pre-registered to testify uh none of
 
02:58:19.870 --> 02:58:19.880 align:start position:0%
them asked for more than three minutes

02:58:54.389 --> 02:58:54.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:57.790 --> 02:58:57.800 align:start position:0%
available yes can you hear me we can

House Judiciary Committee thank you for
 
02:59:04.110 --> 02:59:04.120 align:start position:0%

02:59:06.389 --> 02:59:06.399 align:start position:0%
testimony uh my name is Jessica gof and
 
02:59:07.870 --> 02:59:07.880 align:start position:0%
I'm a resident of conquered New
 
02:59:09.830 --> 02:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm a master of Social Work
 
02:59:12.070 --> 02:59:12.080 align:start position:0%
student at UNH and a policy intern at
 
02:59:13.269 --> 02:59:13.279 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Council on
 
02:59:15.870 --> 02:59:15.880 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities um I want to
 
02:59:18.550 --> 02:59:18.560 align:start position:0%
speak in strong support for HB 540
 
02:59:20.309 --> 02:59:20.319 align:start position:0%
members of the disability community and
 
02:59:21.870 --> 02:59:21.880 align:start position:0%
their families who live in our great
 
02:59:23.510 --> 02:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
state deserve a less restrictive
 
02:59:25.950 --> 02:59:25.960 align:start position:0%
alternative to guardianship the practice
 
02:59:27.990 --> 02:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
of guardianship inherently removes the
 
02:59:30.030 --> 02:59:30.040 align:start position:0%
given rights of adults with disabilities
 
02:59:32.150 --> 02:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
to make decisions and engage equally in
 
02:59:34.670 --> 02:59:34.680 align:start position:0%
the world around us often This legal
 
02:59:36.630 --> 02:59:36.640 align:start position:0%
transfer of choice-making power from
 
02:59:38.870 --> 02:59:38.880 align:start position:0%
what we call the ward to the guardian is
 
02:59:41.150 --> 02:59:41.160 align:start position:0%
done in totality and encompasses
 
02:59:42.830 --> 02:59:42.840 align:start position:0%
everything from control of money to
 
02:59:44.550 --> 02:59:44.560 align:start position:0%
making decisions around healthare
 
02:59:46.710 --> 02:59:46.720 align:start position:0%
education housing and even the ability
 
02:59:48.790 --> 02:59:48.800 align:start position:0%
to get married for some this means
 
02:59:50.389 --> 02:59:50.399 align:start position:0%
removing the right to vote and to
 
02:59:52.510 --> 02:59:52.520 align:start position:0%
testify in court given these severe
 
02:59:54.790 --> 02:59:54.800 align:start position:0%
limitations to an individual's autonomy
 
02:59:56.630 --> 02:59:56.640 align:start position:0%
guardianship should be viewed as the
 
02:59:59.269 --> 02:59:59.279 align:start position:0%
last resort but in order to reduce the
 
03:00:01.190 --> 03:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
rates of Guardianship and allow for
 
03:00:02.750 --> 03:00:02.760 align:start position:0%
adults with disabilities to take a
 
03:00:04.910 --> 03:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
leading role in their lives we need less
 
03:00:07.349 --> 03:00:07.359 align:start position:0%
restrictive legal options that assist
 
03:00:09.710 --> 03:00:09.720 align:start position:0%
individuals to make informed decisions
 
03:00:11.990 --> 03:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
with those who they trust supported
 
03:00:13.790 --> 03:00:13.800 align:start position:0%
decision-making has been hailed as a
 
03:00:15.710 --> 03:00:15.720 align:start position:0%
balance alternative as seen in the
 
03:00:17.910 --> 03:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
momentum throughout the advocacy and
 
03:00:20.550 --> 03:00:20.560 align:start position:0%
legislation across the country um as was
 
03:00:22.190 --> 03:00:22.200 align:start position:0%
talked about a number of well respected
 
03:00:24.110 --> 03:00:24.120 align:start position:0%
organizations have come out in support
 
03:00:26.950 --> 03:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
including the national guardianship
 
03:00:28.990 --> 03:00:29.000 align:start position:0%
Association uh the stated purpose of
 
03:00:30.630 --> 03:00:30.640 align:start position:0%
appointing a guardian under current New
 
03:00:32.469 --> 03:00:32.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law is to quote unquote
 
03:00:34.990 --> 03:00:35.000 align:start position:0%
protect the well-being of incapacitated
 
03:00:36.990 --> 03:00:37.000 align:start position:0%
persons who are unable to provide for
 
03:00:38.590 --> 03:00:38.600 align:start position:0%
their own personal needs due to
 
03:00:40.950 --> 03:00:40.960 align:start position:0%
functional limitations uh we need to
 
03:00:43.070 --> 03:00:43.080 align:start position:0%
recognize that well-being is a concept
 
03:00:44.670 --> 03:00:44.680 align:start position:0%
that should encompass comp more than
 
03:00:46.670 --> 03:00:46.680 align:start position:0%
just safety we need to think about
 
03:00:48.990 --> 03:00:49.000 align:start position:0%
quality of life and access to the full
 
03:00:51.349 --> 03:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
rights of citizenship in both the course
 
03:00:53.750 --> 03:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
of my graduate education and my previous
 
03:00:55.429 --> 03:00:55.439 align:start position:0%
work as a direct support professional
 
03:00:57.710 --> 03:00:57.720 align:start position:0%
with adults with disabilities I've seen
 
03:00:59.469 --> 03:00:59.479 align:start position:0%
both the detrimental effects of force
 
03:01:01.670 --> 03:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
control and the amazing benefits in the
 
03:01:03.389 --> 03:01:03.399 align:start position:0%
capabilities of individuals when they
 
03:01:05.269 --> 03:01:05.279 align:start position:0%
are given the opportunity to sit at the
 
03:01:06.950 --> 03:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
head of the table and making decisions
 
03:01:09.229 --> 03:01:09.239 align:start position:0%
that affect their lives right now
 
03:01:10.630 --> 03:01:10.640 align:start position:0%
parents of Youth who are transitioning
 
03:01:12.590 --> 03:01:12.600 align:start position:0%
into adulthood are given a seemingly
 
03:01:14.830 --> 03:01:14.840 align:start position:0%
impossible choice to take their child's
 
03:01:16.510 --> 03:01:16.520 align:start position:0%
right to choose away or to allow the
 
03:01:18.510 --> 03:01:18.520 align:start position:0%
young adult to preserve the legal rights
 
03:01:20.349 --> 03:01:20.359 align:start position:0%
but eliminate their ability as parents
 
03:01:21.910 --> 03:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
to support their children in what they
 
03:01:24.190 --> 03:01:24.200 align:start position:0%
need to be successful this bill would
 
03:01:26.349 --> 03:01:26.359 align:start position:0%
allow a comprehensive third option which
 
03:01:28.070 --> 03:01:28.080 align:start position:0%
would enable adults with disabilities to
 
03:01:29.790 --> 03:01:29.800 align:start position:0%
keep their rights but ensure that they
 
03:01:31.870 --> 03:01:31.880 align:start position:0%
have access to needed supports with the
 
03:01:33.750 --> 03:01:33.760 align:start position:0%
guidance and of and assistance of their
 
03:01:35.990 --> 03:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
supporters I urge you to vote OD to pass
 
03:01:37.790 --> 03:01:37.800 align:start position:0%
on HB
 
03:01:40.830 --> 03:01:40.840 align:start position:0%
540 um again I just I believe that this
 
03:01:43.229 --> 03:01:43.239 align:start position:0%
is a really great bill in the work that
 
03:01:45.670 --> 03:01:45.680 align:start position:0%
I've done I've seen so many individuals
 
03:01:48.309 --> 03:01:48.319 align:start position:0%
who are very capable of making choices
 
03:01:50.309 --> 03:01:50.319 align:start position:0%
who have a guardianship often appointed
 
03:01:52.910 --> 03:01:52.920 align:start position:0%
by the state who they may not even know
 
03:01:54.429 --> 03:01:54.439 align:start position:0%
um so they have individuals making
 
03:01:56.910 --> 03:01:56.920 align:start position:0%
choices for them without their input uh
 
03:01:59.670 --> 03:01:59.680 align:start position:0%
because guardianship is inherently
 
03:02:02.790 --> 03:02:02.800 align:start position:0%
taking someone's rights away um that is
 
03:02:04.790 --> 03:02:04.800 align:start position:0%
the purpose of Guardianship and so
 
03:02:07.590 --> 03:02:07.600 align:start position:0%
another option would really allow people
 
03:02:09.670 --> 03:02:09.680 align:start position:0%
to be able to get access to services and
 
03:02:11.990 --> 03:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
have that codified under law so as
 
03:02:13.309 --> 03:02:13.319 align:start position:0%
representative Gordon you were talking
 
03:02:15.990 --> 03:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
about as a doctor under current law an
 
03:02:17.990 --> 03:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
individual can have this decision
 
03:02:20.309 --> 03:02:20.319 align:start position:0%
informally um but if they bring it to
 
03:02:22.070 --> 03:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
you you're not really sure who to listen
 
03:02:25.070 --> 03:02:25.080 align:start position:0%
to who has the legal rights um but this
 
03:02:26.950 --> 03:02:26.960 align:start position:0%
would put it into law so that you're
 
03:02:29.790 --> 03:02:29.800 align:start position:0%
fully aware of exactly in what domains
 
03:02:31.309 --> 03:02:31.319 align:start position:0%
the supporters are able to get
 
03:02:33.750 --> 03:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
information um when they're able to be
 
03:02:35.269 --> 03:02:35.279 align:start position:0%
present in appointments to get that
 
03:02:37.389 --> 03:02:37.399 align:start position:0%
information how Hippa applies and
 
03:02:40.269 --> 03:02:40.279 align:start position:0%
everybody is on the same page um so
 
03:02:41.830 --> 03:02:41.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to provide my
 
03:02:46.309 --> 03:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you representative MC
 
03:02:50.670 --> 03:02:50.680 align:start position:0%
Beth thank you Mr chair um so I I
 
03:02:52.309 --> 03:02:52.319 align:start position:0%
apologize for being late this morning
 
03:02:54.630 --> 03:02:54.640 align:start position:0%
but I actually was in the um Probate

you were asking a question as Judith
Jones

03:03:26.429 --> 03:03:26.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:33.630 --> 03:03:33.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:36.670 --> 03:03:36.680 align:start position:0%
unmute well the first law of speaking as
 
03:03:38.990 --> 03:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
an attorney is to unmute can you hear me
 
03:03:44.030 --> 03:03:44.040 align:start position:0%
now we can thank you so much so
 
03:03:46.590 --> 03:03:46.600 align:start position:0%
my name is Judith Jones I've practiced
 
03:03:48.790 --> 03:03:48.800 align:start position:0%
law New Hampshire since
 
03:03:51.590 --> 03:03:51.600 align:start position:0%
1998 the focus of my practice has been
 
03:03:53.349 --> 03:03:53.359 align:start position:0%
on assisting older adults and
 
03:03:55.590 --> 03:03:55.600 align:start position:0%
individuals with disabilities I'm
 
03:03:57.630 --> 03:03:57.640 align:start position:0%
pleased to have the opportunity to
 
03:04:01.150 --> 03:04:01.160 align:start position:0%
support House Bill 540 so you've already
 
03:04:04.750 --> 03:04:04.760 align:start position:0%
heard the testimony in favor of the
 
03:04:07.710 --> 03:04:07.720 align:start position:0%
house bill and focusing on that it's a
 
03:04:10.429 --> 03:04:10.439 align:start position:0%
model to support individuals with
 
03:04:12.590 --> 03:04:12.600 align:start position:0%
disabilities in communicating their own
 
03:04:14.710 --> 03:04:14.720 align:start position:0%
decisions in their Liv lives and it's
 
03:04:17.670 --> 03:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
really based on this it's based on the
 
03:04:19.550 --> 03:04:19.560 align:start position:0%
premise that all individuals have the
 
03:04:21.670 --> 03:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
right to make decisions that impact
 
03:04:24.190 --> 03:04:24.200 align:start position:0%
their lives as others have said our
 
03:04:26.790 --> 03:04:26.800 align:start position:0%
current system is really based on
 
03:04:29.389 --> 03:04:29.399 align:start position:0%
substituted decision- making and other
 
03:04:32.389 --> 03:04:32.399 align:start position:0%
making a decision for me what this does
 
03:04:35.670 --> 03:04:35.680 align:start position:0%
is really shift the framework of our our
 
03:04:38.469 --> 03:04:38.479 align:start position:0%
legal framework from substituted
 
03:04:41.750 --> 03:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
decisions to supported decisions and I
 
03:04:43.870 --> 03:04:43.880 align:start position:0%
thought most importantly today to use my
 
03:04:45.870 --> 03:04:45.880 align:start position:0%
time to give you examples of how this
 
03:04:48.750 --> 03:04:48.760 align:start position:0%
legislation could impact my practice
 
03:04:51.150 --> 03:04:51.160 align:start position:0%
we've heard testimony from a parent to
 
03:04:54.710 --> 03:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
parents what seeking guardianship has
 
03:04:58.510 --> 03:04:58.520 align:start position:0%
done and the process how difficult that
 
03:05:00.990 --> 03:05:01.000 align:start position:0%
was I've had the opportunity to
 
03:05:02.590 --> 03:05:02.600 align:start position:0%
represent a number of parents and
 
03:05:04.590 --> 03:05:04.600 align:start position:0%
guardianships and also represent
 
03:05:07.349 --> 03:05:07.359 align:start position:0%
proposed Wards and the common issue we
 
03:05:11.030 --> 03:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
see among parents facing an individual
 
03:05:13.710 --> 03:05:13.720 align:start position:0%
child turning age 18 is really anguish
 
03:05:15.790 --> 03:05:15.800 align:start position:0%
about the guardianship process
 
03:05:17.990 --> 03:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
guardianship about the court the the
 
03:05:20.070 --> 03:05:20.080 align:start position:0%
difficulty with the court process and
 
03:05:22.229 --> 03:05:22.239 align:start position:0%
having to go through a Litany of a
 
03:05:25.550 --> 03:05:25.560 align:start position:0%
child's deficits I think of two cases I
 
03:05:27.670 --> 03:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
have where there is a guardianship in
 
03:05:30.389 --> 03:05:30.399 align:start position:0%
place but with the passage of this bill
 
03:05:33.150 --> 03:05:33.160 align:start position:0%
I think there's a potential to revisit
 
03:05:35.670 --> 03:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
the need for a continued guardianship
 
03:05:38.110 --> 03:05:38.120 align:start position:0%
one of these individuals is involved in
 
03:05:40.469 --> 03:05:40.479 align:start position:0%
a life skill training course and she's
 
03:05:43.269 --> 03:05:43.279 align:start position:0%
been very very successful another indiv
 
03:05:46.190 --> 03:05:46.200 align:start position:0%
individual shows the ability to her own
 
03:05:48.349 --> 03:05:48.359 align:start position:0%
on her own initiative reach out to other
 
03:05:51.550 --> 03:05:51.560 align:start position:0%
professionals to get information to make
 
03:05:53.750 --> 03:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
decisions an
 
03:05:56.710 --> 03:05:56.720 align:start position:0%
example that really goes to what
 
03:05:59.229 --> 03:05:59.239 align:start position:0%
representative Gordon raised is one
 
03:06:01.030 --> 03:06:01.040 align:start position:0%
where my colleague had a case where we
 
03:06:04.070 --> 03:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
had a very very intelligent client with
 
03:06:06.429 --> 03:06:06.439 align:start position:0%
sarb baly who had
 
03:06:09.469 --> 03:06:09.479 align:start position:0%
difficulty communicating his needs and a
 
03:06:12.190 --> 03:06:12.200 align:start position:0%
parent who is very skilled in
 
03:06:14.510 --> 03:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
understanding what her child wanted and
 
03:06:16.630 --> 03:06:16.640 align:start position:0%
understanding his medical history and
 
03:06:18.550 --> 03:06:18.560 align:start position:0%
this is a case where the parent was a
 
03:06:20.389 --> 03:06:20.399 align:start position:0%
natural fit for the
 
03:06:23.710 --> 03:06:23.720 align:start position:0%
supporter like attorney skibby I acted
 
03:06:26.750 --> 03:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
as a caretaker for my own mother and I
 
03:06:28.950 --> 03:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
look at how this legislation could have
 
03:06:30.469 --> 03:06:30.479 align:start position:0%
impacted that
 
03:06:32.349 --> 03:06:32.359 align:start position:0%
relationship and though I had the
 
03:06:34.389 --> 03:06:34.399 align:start position:0%
ability to act as her supporter and did
 
03:06:38.070 --> 03:06:38.080 align:start position:0%
so what I found was mostly often in a
 
03:06:40.349 --> 03:06:40.359 align:start position:0%
busy Medical Practice what happened to
 
03:06:43.269 --> 03:06:43.279 align:start position:0%
me as the person acting as the helper
 
03:06:45.590 --> 03:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
everyone naturally looked to me to make
 
03:06:48.229 --> 03:06:48.239 align:start position:0%
the decisions and the focus was not on
 
03:06:51.269 --> 03:06:51.279 align:start position:0%
my mother what this legislation would do
 
03:06:53.750 --> 03:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
is make clear I'm the supporter and this
 
03:06:56.150 --> 03:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
is the decision maker and while I was
 
03:06:59.229 --> 03:06:59.239 align:start position:0%
able to redirect the providers I think
 
03:07:01.550 --> 03:07:01.560 align:start position:0%
that this kind of contract and this
 
03:07:03.229 --> 03:07:03.239 align:start position:0%
statute would
 
03:07:05.229 --> 03:07:05.239 align:start position:0%
enable and
 
03:07:08.750 --> 03:07:08.760 align:start position:0%
support a further shift in our legal
 
03:07:11.190 --> 03:07:11.200 align:start position:0%
system from substituted decisionmaking
 
03:07:14.309 --> 03:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
to supported decision-making finally
 
03:07:15.950 --> 03:07:15.960 align:start position:0%
what I thought about with this testimony
 
03:07:18.910 --> 03:07:18.920 align:start position:0%
today is just um so pleased to be able
 
03:07:21.150 --> 03:07:21.160 align:start position:0%
to practice law in New Hampshire and I
 
03:07:23.150 --> 03:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
thought about other states have adopted
 
03:07:25.830 --> 03:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
this legislation but you look at our
 
03:07:28.630 --> 03:07:28.640 align:start position:0%
state with this proud and long tradition
 
03:07:30.550 --> 03:07:30.560 align:start position:0%
of respecting rights of
 
03:07:32.510 --> 03:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
individuals and promoting
 
03:07:34.870 --> 03:07:34.880 align:start position:0%
self-determination and I believe that
 
03:07:37.910 --> 03:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
house bill 540 really is the next step
 
03:07:40.389 --> 03:07:40.399 align:start position:0%
in the evolution of our law to actively
 
03:07:42.349 --> 03:07:42.359 align:start position:0%
promote and honor the ability of all
 
03:07:45.030 --> 03:07:45.040 align:start position:0%
persons and what better State than the
 
03:07:48.590 --> 03:07:48.600 align:start position:0%
Live Free or Die State thank you you
 
03:07:50.469 --> 03:07:50.479 align:start position:0%

540 a bill to create and establish the
 
03:08:52.790 --> 03:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
supported decision-making model here in
 
03:08:55.510 --> 03:08:55.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire on behalf of able its's
 
03:08:57.550 --> 03:08:57.560 align:start position:0%
board and members across the beautiful
 
03:08:59.630 --> 03:08:59.640 align:start position:0%
Granite State I'm asking you to support
 
03:08:59.640 --> 03:09:00.670 align:start position:0%
Granite State I'm asking you to support
HB

03:09:00.670 --> 03:09:00.680 align:start position:0%
HB
 
03:09:04.110 --> 03:09:04.120 align:start position:0%
540 as you know RSA
 
03:09:06.590 --> 03:09:06.600 align:start position:0%
171a established New Hampshire's
 
03:09:08.429 --> 03:09:08.439 align:start position:0%
community-based system of supports and
 
03:09:10.830 --> 03:09:10.840 align:start position:0%
services for people with developmental
 
03:09:14.150 --> 03:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
disabilities a key element of having a
 
03:09:16.830 --> 03:09:16.840 align:start position:0%
community-based life is the ability to
 
03:09:16.840 --> 03:09:18.190 align:start position:0%
community-based life is the ability to
be

03:09:18.190 --> 03:09:18.200 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:09:20.950 --> 03:09:20.960 align:start position:0%
self-determining supported
 
03:09:24.309 --> 03:09:24.319 align:start position:0%
decisionmaking um is an important viable
 
03:09:26.429 --> 03:09:26.439 align:start position:0%
alternative to guardianship which
 
03:09:31.190 --> 03:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
advances the development of skills for
 
03:09:34.070 --> 03:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
self-determination um it was nice to
 
03:09:37.030 --> 03:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
hear attorney Jones just now reference
 
03:09:38.750 --> 03:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
how New Hampshire has been at the
 
03:09:41.670 --> 03:09:41.680 align:start position:0%
Forefront of asserting rights for people
 
03:09:44.030 --> 03:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
with disabilities you all know that New
 
03:09:46.229 --> 03:09:46.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire closed its state institution
 
03:09:49.269 --> 03:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
30 years ago in the effort to advance
 
03:09:51.030 --> 03:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
human rights for people with
 
03:09:53.830 --> 03:09:53.840 align:start position:0%
disabilities essentially to make real
 
03:09:56.870 --> 03:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for these citizens to
 
03:09:59.990 --> 03:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
access the American dream too supported
 
03:10:02.550 --> 03:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
decisionmaking is yet another tool in
 
03:10:04.550 --> 03:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
the quest to fully
 
03:10:07.630 --> 03:10:07.640 align:start position:0%
include uh uh people with disabilities
 
03:10:09.950 --> 03:10:09.960 align:start position:0%
these Americans in the
 
03:10:12.429 --> 03:10:12.439 align:start position:0%
dream supported decision-making is a
 
03:10:14.510 --> 03:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
process that facilitates people to
 
03:10:18.550 --> 03:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
become and remain more integrated in the
 
03:10:21.269 --> 03:10:21.279 align:start position:0%
community more importantly research
 
03:10:23.710 --> 03:10:23.720 align:start position:0%
shows that this model increases
 
03:10:27.190 --> 03:10:27.200 align:start position:0%
protection against abuse and
 
03:10:30.550 --> 03:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
exploitation just a couple of more
 
03:10:32.950 --> 03:10:32.960 align:start position:0%
points on why supported decision making
 
03:10:35.870 --> 03:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
is important it's a means to empower
 
03:10:38.070 --> 03:10:38.080 align:start position:0%
people with disabilities and the Aging
 
03:10:40.150 --> 03:10:40.160 align:start position:0%
to remain at the center of
 
03:10:43.870 --> 03:10:43.880 align:start position:0%
decision-making processes in their lives
 
03:10:46.550 --> 03:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
research also shows that maximizing
 
03:10:49.269 --> 03:10:49.279 align:start position:0%
choice and control in a person's life
 
03:10:52.389 --> 03:10:52.399 align:start position:0%
increases positive Health outcomes
 
03:10:55.269 --> 03:10:55.279 align:start position:0%
happiness and safety through stronger
 
03:10:57.670 --> 03:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
relationships and better ability to
 
03:11:00.510 --> 03:11:00.520 align:start position:0%
recognize and resist
 
03:11:03.990 --> 03:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
abuse uh and one of the reasons why
 
03:11:07.429 --> 03:11:07.439 align:start position:0%
supported decision- making appeals to me
 
03:11:10.469 --> 03:11:10.479 align:start position:0%
personally as a parent and not just as a
 
03:11:13.030 --> 03:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
professional is the idea that support
 
03:11:16.309 --> 03:11:16.319 align:start position:0%
decision making is normal most people
 
03:11:19.030 --> 03:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
use informal supports in making personal
 
03:11:21.950 --> 03:11:21.960 align:start position:0%
decisions just like you and I we seek
 
03:11:25.110 --> 03:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
the advice of trusted friends Andor

03:11:30.510 --> 03:11:30.520 align:start position:0%
professional and other issues let's
 
03:11:32.990 --> 03:11:33.000 align:start position:0%

I was on the work group that helped

draft the bill I I think it was very um
 
03:13:20.590 --> 03:13:20.600 align:start position:0%
well thought out and well reasoned and I
 
03:13:24.269 --> 03:13:24.279 align:start position:0%
would just say in my experience um of
 
03:13:26.870 --> 03:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
over 20 years working U with older
 
03:13:29.429 --> 03:13:29.439 align:start position:0%
adults I can absolutely see the need for
 
03:13:32.870 --> 03:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
this and um the value um I've talked to
 
03:13:34.750 --> 03:13:34.760 align:start position:0%
many people who are kind of in this in
 
03:13:37.229 --> 03:13:37.239 align:start position:0%
between you know able to make some
 
03:13:38.750 --> 03:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
decisions and not others and they're
 
03:13:40.349 --> 03:13:40.359 align:start position:0%
under a Guardianship and I could tell
 
03:13:42.150 --> 03:13:42.160 align:start position:0%
you how distressing it is for them I
 
03:13:45.150 --> 03:13:45.160 align:start position:0%
mean if you can just even imagine the
 
03:13:46.950 --> 03:13:46.960 align:start position:0%
the the distress when you might have to
 
03:13:49.830 --> 03:13:49.840 align:start position:0%
tell a parent um you can't drive anymore
 
03:13:52.070 --> 03:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
we're taking the carck keys away I mean
 
03:13:54.830 --> 03:13:54.840 align:start position:0%
how devastating that one act is um it
 
03:13:56.990 --> 03:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
just to have a guardianship um where you
 
03:13:58.710 --> 03:13:58.720 align:start position:0%
can't even make any decisions for
 
03:14:01.070 --> 03:14:01.080 align:start position:0%
yourself um how distressing that could
 
03:14:03.590 --> 03:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
be so any kind of tool that we can have
 
03:14:06.269 --> 03:14:06.279 align:start position:0%
at our disposal when appropriate to
 
03:14:09.670 --> 03:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
allow um uh people to maintain their
 
03:14:12.150 --> 03:14:12.160 align:start position:0%
decision- making um ability I think is
 
03:14:14.229 --> 03:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
is a good thing and I'll just end there
 
03:14:16.590 --> 03:14:16.600 align:start position:0%
I just uh would urge you to vote off to
 
03:14:19.389 --> 03:14:19.399 align:start position:0%

Gordon and the entire Judiciary
 
03:14:42.070 --> 03:14:42.080 align:start position:0%
Committee for allowing me to speak today
 
03:14:43.790 --> 03:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
as the executive director of the Monarch
 
03:14:45.269 --> 03:14:45.279 align:start position:0%
School of New England and approved
 
03:14:46.950 --> 03:14:46.960 align:start position:0%
private special education school for
 
03:14:48.870 --> 03:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
children with disabilities located in
 
03:14:51.910 --> 03:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
Rochester I am pleased to support hb4
 
03:14:54.269 --> 03:14:54.279 align:start position:0%
540 and the concept of supported
 
03:14:56.469 --> 03:14:56.479 align:start position:0%
decisionmaking as an alternative to
 
03:14:59.309 --> 03:14:59.319 align:start position:0%
guardianship over the past 23 years I
 
03:15:00.910 --> 03:15:00.920 align:start position:0%
have had the pleasure of working with
 
03:15:02.950 --> 03:15:02.960 align:start position:0%
many parents and students preparing for
 
03:15:05.190 --> 03:15:05.200 align:start position:0%
the transition to adulthood it is a
 
03:15:07.990 --> 03:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
stressful and busy time for all parents
 
03:15:10.150 --> 03:15:10.160 align:start position:0%
and students that face many decisions
 
03:15:12.469 --> 03:15:12.479 align:start position:0%
ahead since we work with students and
 
03:15:14.269 --> 03:15:14.279 align:start position:0%
their families for a number of years we
 
03:15:17.349 --> 03:15:17.359 align:start position:0%
develop trusting relationships over time
 
03:15:19.510 --> 03:15:19.520 align:start position:0%
as a school we work hard to instill
 
03:15:21.750 --> 03:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
Independence at every level of function
 
03:15:23.830 --> 03:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
teaching our students to self- Advocate
 
03:15:26.630 --> 03:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
whenever possible we presume competence
 
03:15:29.070 --> 03:15:29.080 align:start position:0%
and concentrate on what a student can do
 
03:15:31.030 --> 03:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
on their abilities rather than their
 
03:15:33.510 --> 03:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
disabilities it is simply joyous to
 
03:15:35.389 --> 03:15:35.399 align:start position:0%
facilitate a student's development from
 
03:15:37.750 --> 03:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
complete dependence to
 
03:15:39.670 --> 03:15:39.680 align:start position:0%
self-confidence when students learn to
 
03:15:41.590 --> 03:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
communicate their thoughts and feelings
 
03:15:44.189 --> 03:15:44.199 align:start position:0%
and understanding the possibilities are
 
03:15:46.189 --> 03:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
endless while guardianship is
 
03:15:47.790 --> 03:15:47.800 align:start position:0%
appropriate for some students for others
 
03:15:49.510 --> 03:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
who are able to self-determine their
 
03:15:51.630 --> 03:15:51.640 align:start position:0%
path ahead with or without the guidance
 
03:15:53.630 --> 03:15:53.640 align:start position:0%
of a trusted individual supported
 
03:15:55.429 --> 03:15:55.439 align:start position:0%
decision- making allows them the freedom
 
03:15:57.070 --> 03:15:57.080 align:start position:0%
and Independence they should have in
 
03:15:59.349 --> 03:15:59.359 align:start position:0%
making choices in how to live their
 
03:16:01.830 --> 03:16:01.840 align:start position:0%
lives because we want families to be
 
03:16:03.910 --> 03:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
fully informed as students reach the age
 
03:16:05.950 --> 03:16:05.960 align:start position:0%
of majority the Monarch School of New
 
03:16:07.389 --> 03:16:07.399 align:start position:0%
England looks forward to sharing
 
03:16:09.309 --> 03:16:09.319 align:start position:0%
materials developed by the New Hampshire
 
03:16:11.229 --> 03:16:11.239 align:start position:0%
Department of Education that will
 
03:16:13.590 --> 03:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
clearly outline all options along the
 
03:16:16.189 --> 03:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
Continuum including power of attorney
 
03:16:20.630 --> 03:16:20.640 align:start position:0%
conservatorship guardianship and and SDM
 
03:16:22.750 --> 03:16:22.760 align:start position:0%
while it is true that IEP teams have the
 
03:16:24.309 --> 03:16:24.319 align:start position:0%
most contact with students with
 
03:16:26.389 --> 03:16:26.399 align:start position:0%
disabilities and their parents making
 
03:16:28.990 --> 03:16:29.000 align:start position:0%
the IEP team appear to be the ideal
 
03:16:32.229 --> 03:16:32.239 align:start position:0%
entity to share these options in our
 
03:16:34.429 --> 03:16:34.439 align:start position:0%
experience sometimes parents select to
 
03:16:37.550 --> 03:16:37.560 align:start position:0%
work outside of the IEP team with area
 
03:16:39.590 --> 03:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
agencies or caregivers from a Community
 
03:16:41.429 --> 03:16:41.439 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Center to carry out this
 
03:16:43.189 --> 03:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
critical step
 
03:16:45.429 --> 03:16:45.439 align:start position:0%
while um these entities will follow
 
03:16:47.830 --> 03:16:47.840 align:start position:0%
students until the age of 21 while
 
03:16:50.110 --> 03:16:50.120 align:start position:0%
school districts will not would it not
 
03:16:52.870 --> 03:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
make sense to hold other enti entities
 
03:16:54.990 --> 03:16:55.000 align:start position:0%
responsible as well for presenting And
 
03:16:56.710 --> 03:16:56.720 align:start position:0%
discussing the options
 
03:16:58.950 --> 03:16:58.960 align:start position:0%
available I do not want to see any
 
03:17:00.389 --> 03:17:00.399 align:start position:0%
individual with a disability fall
 
03:17:02.110 --> 03:17:02.120 align:start position:0%
through the cracks yet as an
 
03:17:04.150 --> 03:17:04.160 align:start position:0%
administrator I fear any consequences
 
03:17:05.790 --> 03:17:05.800 align:start position:0%
should a school inadvertently fail to
 
03:17:07.389 --> 03:17:07.399 align:start position:0%
inform the family of the choices other
 
03:17:08.910 --> 03:17:08.920 align:start position:0%
than guardianship because so much is
 
03:17:10.550 --> 03:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
going on at this busy juncture in a
 
03:17:12.750 --> 03:17:12.760 align:start position:0%
student's life thank you for the
 
03:17:15.030 --> 03:17:15.040 align:start position:0%

with individuals with disabilities I'm
 
03:17:27.710 --> 03:17:27.720 align:start position:0%

03:18:00.469 --> 03:18:00.479 align:start position:0%
because I think all the people that
 
03:18:02.630 --> 03:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
presented testimony before um the
 
03:18:04.469 --> 03:18:04.479 align:start position:0%
practitioners have more experience years
 
03:18:06.349 --> 03:18:06.359 align:start position:0%
of experience than I do in this area and
 
03:18:09.030 --> 03:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
the um people with personal experiences
 
03:18:12.389 --> 03:18:12.399 align:start position:0%
um certainly had a lot of impact I just
 
03:18:14.910 --> 03:18:14.920 align:start position:0%
I I do practice in this area just had a
 
03:18:16.469 --> 03:18:16.479 align:start position:0%
a wonderful hearing this morning on a
 
03:18:18.750 --> 03:18:18.760 align:start position:0%
petition for guardianship in the uh
 
03:18:21.630 --> 03:18:21.640 align:start position:0%
Brentwood Probate Court um I want to let
 
03:18:23.990 --> 03:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
you know that um for those of you that
 
03:18:25.910 --> 03:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
don't and I Wendy would you hold your
 
03:18:27.309 --> 03:18:27.319 align:start position:0%
hand up at three minutes so I know when
 
03:18:29.910 --> 03:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
I'm done but I do see this I I'm
 
03:18:33.229 --> 03:18:33.239 align:start position:0%
speaking in favor of this idea um I
 
03:18:35.030 --> 03:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
don't see it as a replacement for
 
03:18:36.990 --> 03:18:37.000 align:start position:0%
guardianship I definitely see it as a
 
03:18:39.309 --> 03:18:39.319 align:start position:0%
good alternative I want to assure
 
03:18:41.830 --> 03:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
everyone that New Hampshire 20 years ago
 
03:18:43.510 --> 03:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
was on on The Cutting Edge of our
 
03:18:46.510 --> 03:18:46.520 align:start position:0%
guardianship uh law we make it so that
 
03:18:48.790 --> 03:18:48.800 align:start position:0%
every guardianship is tailored and I I
 
03:18:50.830 --> 03:18:50.840 align:start position:0%
can use a prop this is a page just one
 
03:18:52.790 --> 03:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
of the four pages on a petition for
 
03:18:55.550 --> 03:18:55.560 align:start position:0%
Guardianship and there are specific
 
03:18:57.870 --> 03:18:57.880 align:start position:0%
every right civil right that's removed
 
03:19:00.229 --> 03:19:00.239 align:start position:0%
from somebody and it is removing a civil
 
03:19:03.349 --> 03:19:03.359 align:start position:0%
right and transferred to the guardian
 
03:19:05.510 --> 03:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
has to be written in the petition and an
 
03:19:08.710 --> 03:19:08.720 align:start position:0%
attorney Like Me by Statute is appointed
 
03:19:12.189 --> 03:19:12.199 align:start position:0%
to discuss it with that proposed Ward um
 
03:19:14.150 --> 03:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
and even this morning after the petition
 
03:19:17.710 --> 03:19:17.720 align:start position:0%
was granted on the on the limited issues
 
03:19:19.590 --> 03:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
um that were either contested or not
 
03:19:22.389 --> 03:19:22.399 align:start position:0%
contested the judge did say reads from
 
03:19:24.670 --> 03:19:24.680 align:start position:0%
the and explains to the guardian that
 
03:19:27.229 --> 03:19:27.239 align:start position:0%
they are under fiduciary responsibility
 
03:19:29.469 --> 03:19:29.479 align:start position:0%
to safeguard to the greatest extent
 
03:19:31.710 --> 03:19:31.720 align:start position:0%
possible even in the rights they've been
 
03:19:33.750 --> 03:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
given transferred that they must
 
03:19:37.229 --> 03:19:37.239 align:start position:0%
Safeguard the GU this the wards rights
 
03:19:39.590 --> 03:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
so I just want to say that but I want to
 
03:19:42.030 --> 03:19:42.040 align:start position:0%
tell you this is the top of the petition
 
03:19:44.950 --> 03:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
ition and it is very difficult for me to
 
03:19:46.590 --> 03:19:46.600 align:start position:0%
go and talk to somebody and tell them
 
03:19:49.469 --> 03:19:49.479 align:start position:0%
that a petition for guardianship
 
03:19:52.349 --> 03:19:52.359 align:start position:0%
declaiming them as an incapacitated
 
03:19:56.070 --> 03:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
person is is not always appropriate and
 
03:19:57.910 --> 03:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
what also is not always appropriate what
 
03:20:00.429 --> 03:20:00.439 align:start position:0%
we've had testimony is this removal of
 
03:20:03.429 --> 03:20:03.439 align:start position:0%
all self-determination from that person
 
03:20:07.070 --> 03:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
um even people that need help
 
03:20:10.309 --> 03:20:10.319 align:start position:0%
um I I um it is an
 
03:20:13.950 --> 03:20:13.960 align:start position:0%
adversarial um proceeding and the person
 
03:20:15.910 --> 03:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
that is under a guardianship is known
 
03:20:18.389 --> 03:20:18.399 align:start position:0%
from there on out on every form as the
 
03:20:21.150 --> 03:20:21.160 align:start position:0%
ward which can be really really
 
03:20:23.870 --> 03:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
inappropriate and two instances of this
 
03:20:26.070 --> 03:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
are um you know A 42-year-old that I
 
03:20:27.349 --> 03:20:27.359 align:start position:0%
worked with years ago that had a
 
03:20:29.229 --> 03:20:29.239 align:start position:0%
motorcycle accident paralyzed from the
 
03:20:31.870 --> 03:20:31.880 align:start position:0%
neck down he's not an incapacitated
 
03:20:35.429 --> 03:20:35.439 align:start position:0%
person he's a person that has needs
 
03:20:37.750 --> 03:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
needs supported decision making but
 
03:20:40.309 --> 03:20:40.319 align:start position:0%
anyway he was you know those were our
 
03:20:42.790 --> 03:20:42.800 align:start position:0%
options um you also are talking about
 
03:20:44.309 --> 03:20:44.319 align:start position:0%
people that even if they might be able
 
03:20:46.750 --> 03:20:46.760 align:start position:0%
to be trained in technology these are
 
03:20:48.550 --> 03:20:48.560 align:start position:0%
people that don't have the resources for
 
03:20:50.349 --> 03:20:50.359 align:start position:0%
that and in New Hampshire we we don't
 
03:20:52.550 --> 03:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
provide those resources another
 
03:20:54.790 --> 03:20:54.800 align:start position:0%
guardianship a 60-year-old woman who had
 
03:20:57.110 --> 03:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
cerebral paly when she was younger I
 
03:20:59.710 --> 03:20:59.720 align:start position:0%
mean when at Birth and had never had a
 
03:21:03.790 --> 03:21:03.800 align:start position:0%
guardian 60 years old but because of
 
03:21:07.550 --> 03:21:07.560 align:start position:0%
her um I think really her presence her
 
03:21:08.950 --> 03:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
the way she presented herself and her
 
03:21:11.389 --> 03:21:11.399 align:start position:0%
inability to communicate clearly to
 
03:21:11.399 --> 03:21:12.349 align:start position:0%
inability to communicate clearly to
people

03:21:12.349 --> 03:21:12.359 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:21:14.189 --> 03:21:14.199 align:start position:0%
a guardianship was really the only
 
03:21:16.309 --> 03:21:16.319 align:start position:0%
option she had because a lot of the
 
03:21:18.110 --> 03:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
communication is by phone she wasn't
 
03:21:20.229 --> 03:21:20.239 align:start position:0%
able to travel places because of lack of
 
03:21:22.870 --> 03:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
Transportation so again I'm I am really
 
03:21:26.550 --> 03:21:26.560 align:start position:0%
supporting this as an option um I do um
 
03:21:28.189 --> 03:21:28.199 align:start position:0%
I'm very interested by attorney
 
03:21:30.670 --> 03:21:30.680 align:start position:0%
Zachary's comments about removing the
 
03:21:33.150 --> 03:21:33.160 align:start position:0%
disability because when I think of my
 
03:21:35.990 --> 03:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
mom and how much I'd like to um help her
 
03:21:37.910 --> 03:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
and be a supportive decision-making
 
03:21:39.950 --> 03:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
she's not she's 85 she's not under a
 
03:21:42.630 --> 03:21:42.640 align:start position:0%
disability any disability except maybe
 
03:21:44.550 --> 03:21:44.560 align:start position:0%
insecurity because she lives in a youth
 
03:21:46.630 --> 03:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
centered culture and also because she
 
03:21:51.870 --> 03:21:51.880 align:start position:0%
has anxiety around some technology um so
 
03:21:56.070 --> 03:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
I um I I see this as the reason why a
 
03:21:59.189 --> 03:21:59.199 align:start position:0%
guardianship is so powerful it's it's
 
03:22:01.309 --> 03:22:01.319 align:start position:0%
and why I think this would be and it
 
03:22:04.110 --> 03:22:04.120 align:start position:0%
goes back to uh chair Gordon's comment
 
03:22:07.510 --> 03:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
this really authorizes people the the
 
03:22:10.429 --> 03:22:10.439 align:start position:0%
professionals it it makes it okay for
 
03:22:12.830 --> 03:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
agencies and entities to share
 
03:22:15.790 --> 03:22:15.800 align:start position:0%
information with another person um and
 
03:22:16.990 --> 03:22:17.000 align:start position:0%
and that's one of the reasons
 
03:22:18.510 --> 03:22:18.520 align:start position:0%
particularly in the 60-year-old woman
 
03:22:20.469 --> 03:22:20.479 align:start position:0%
that I was talking about she was getting
 
03:22:23.269 --> 03:22:23.279 align:start position:0%
run over by agencies and people and she
 
03:22:25.429 --> 03:22:25.439 align:start position:0%
needed an advocate that had a paper that
 
03:22:28.229 --> 03:22:28.239 align:start position:0%
said you have to listen to me so anyway
 
03:22:29.990 --> 03:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm so grateful that we're talking
 
03:22:32.229 --> 03:22:32.239 align:start position:0%
about this I think it's so important and
 
03:22:36.349 --> 03:22:36.359 align:start position:0%
I um I I I'm I I think there's some
 
03:22:37.990 --> 03:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
things that might need to be worked on
 
03:22:40.309 --> 03:22:40.319 align:start position:0%
but I just um I'm thrilled to have it in
 
03:22:42.950 --> 03:22:42.960 align:start position:0%

03:22:45.070 --> 03:22:45.080 align:start position:0%

go

04:01:10.630 --> 04:01:10.640 align:start position:0%

can thank you uh so HP 440 um is H is a
 
04:01:24.590 --> 04:01:24.600 align:start position:0%
bill to protect religious liberty in New
 
04:01:28.670 --> 04:01:28.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um and I also want to direct
 
04:01:31.030 --> 04:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
your attention to the fact that I have
 
04:01:33.349 --> 04:01:33.359 align:start position:0%
been discussing a proposed amendment
 
04:01:35.950 --> 04:01:35.960 align:start position:0%
with representative Sylvia which I
 
04:01:38.590 --> 04:01:38.600 align:start position:0%
believe he has uh shared with the rest
 
04:01:40.790 --> 04:01:40.800 align:start position:0%
of you um so I will speak to the
 
04:01:43.550 --> 04:01:43.560 align:start position:0%
original bill and the uh the proposed
 
04:01:46.910 --> 04:01:46.920 align:start position:0%
amendment as well here if I
 
04:01:50.830 --> 04:01:50.840 align:start position:0%
may um so uh James Madison the architect
 
04:01:52.510 --> 04:01:52.520 align:start position:0%
of our federal free exercise clause
 
04:01:54.070 --> 04:01:54.080 align:start position:0%
wrote that the right to free exercise of
 
04:01:56.590 --> 04:01:56.600 align:start position:0%
religion is held by the same tenure with
 
04:01:59.670 --> 04:01:59.680 align:start position:0%
all of our other rights uh the intention
 
04:02:02.389 --> 04:02:02.399 align:start position:0%
of this bill is to ensure that that
 
04:02:05.910 --> 04:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
intent is honored in the state of New
 
04:02:08.750 --> 04:02:08.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um in effect it it directs
 
04:02:10.750 --> 04:02:10.760 align:start position:0%
judges to treat part one Article 5 of
 
04:02:13.149 --> 04:02:13.159 align:start position:0%
our state constitution as an enforceable
 
04:02:18.469 --> 04:02:18.479 align:start position:0%
legal right um and um you know you one
 
04:02:21.149 --> 04:02:21.159 align:start position:0%
may ask why that's necessary um and and
 
04:02:22.790 --> 04:02:22.800 align:start position:0%
essentially it it comes down to the fact
 
04:02:24.950 --> 04:02:24.960 align:start position:0%
that in some judges Chambers around the
 
04:02:27.189 --> 04:02:27.199 align:start position:0%
country uh there has been a school of
 
04:02:28.830 --> 04:02:28.840 align:start position:0%
thought that holds that constitutional
 
04:02:31.070 --> 04:02:31.080 align:start position:0%
protections for religion should be
 
04:02:32.910 --> 04:02:32.920 align:start position:0%
viewed as a matter of preference not
 
04:02:35.309 --> 04:02:35.319 align:start position:0%
necessarily A strictly enforceable right
 
04:02:38.429 --> 04:02:38.439 align:start position:0%
and so the intention of this bill has
 
04:02:40.750 --> 04:02:40.760 align:start position:0%
been to uh to underscore legislative
 
04:02:43.429 --> 04:02:43.439 align:start position:0%
intent uh to treat religious liberty as
 
04:02:46.349 --> 04:02:46.359 align:start position:0%
a uh as a as a strictly interpreted
 
04:02:46.359 --> 04:02:47.590 align:start position:0%
a uh as a as a strictly interpreted
constitutional

04:02:47.590 --> 04:02:47.600 align:start position:0%
constitutional
 
04:02:49.870 --> 04:02:49.880 align:start position:0%
right uh fortunately our our state
 
04:02:52.830 --> 04:02:52.840 align:start position:0%
supreme court um has has not taken that
 
04:02:54.750 --> 04:02:54.760 align:start position:0%
view uh that I mentioned earlier they
 
04:02:56.710 --> 04:02:56.720 align:start position:0%
have come down uh firmly on the side of
 
04:02:56.720 --> 04:02:57.630 align:start position:0%
have come down uh firmly on the side of
religious

04:02:57.630 --> 04:02:57.640 align:start position:0%
religious
 
04:03:00.750 --> 04:03:00.760 align:start position:0%
liberty um on December 22nd after this
 
04:03:03.670 --> 04:03:03.680 align:start position:0%
bill was filed the Supreme Court decided
 
04:03:05.990 --> 04:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
the case of New Hampshire versus Mack
 
04:03:07.670 --> 04:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
and in that decision they asserted the
 
04:03:09.590 --> 04:03:09.600 align:start position:0%
right to free exercise of religion
 
04:03:12.149 --> 04:03:12.159 align:start position:0%
stating that part one Article 5 must be
 
04:03:14.469 --> 04:03:14.479 align:start position:0%
applied by New Hampshire judges and so
 
04:03:16.429 --> 04:03:16.439 align:start position:0%
in essence what that ruling does is it
 
04:03:18.910 --> 04:03:18.920 align:start position:0%
provides the protection that this bill
 
04:03:20.630 --> 04:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
was intended to
 
04:03:22.550 --> 04:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
guarantee so we could potentially
 
04:03:24.229 --> 04:03:24.239 align:start position:0%
proceed with this bill as a sort of a
 
04:03:25.790 --> 04:03:25.800 align:start position:0%
statutory fallback to the Court's
 
04:03:28.110 --> 04:03:28.120 align:start position:0%
decision that wouldn't necessarily be a
 
04:03:31.630 --> 04:03:31.640 align:start position:0%
bad thing however um there's another
 
04:03:34.349 --> 04:03:34.359 align:start position:0%
concern that that has come up that I I
 
04:03:37.469 --> 04:03:37.479 align:start position:0%
think uh really is required in order for
 
04:03:39.790 --> 04:03:39.800 align:start position:0%
us to underscore this uh protection of
 
04:03:41.990 --> 04:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
religious liberty and frankly for that
 
04:03:44.189 --> 04:03:44.199 align:start position:0%
matter all other civil liberties
 
04:03:45.429 --> 04:03:45.439 align:start position:0%
guaranteed under the US and New
 
04:03:45.439 --> 04:03:46.670 align:start position:0%
guaranteed under the US and New
Hampshire

04:03:46.670 --> 04:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:03:49.510 --> 04:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
constitutions um the proposed amendment
 
04:03:50.990 --> 04:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
addresses the question of whether
 
04:03:53.469 --> 04:03:53.479 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights may be suspended
 
04:03:56.349 --> 04:03:56.359 align:start position:0%
during a time of Crisis and although
 
04:03:58.630 --> 04:03:58.640 align:start position:0%
that may sound like an unlikely scenario
 
04:04:00.389 --> 04:04:00.399 align:start position:0%
it is actually the current state of the
 
04:04:04.030 --> 04:04:04.040 align:start position:0%
law right now in New Hampshire in 2020
 
04:04:05.670 --> 04:04:05.680 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Superior Court issued
 
04:04:07.670 --> 04:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
a ruling in which they stated and I
 
04:04:07.680 --> 04:04:08.790 align:start position:0%
a ruling in which they stated and I
quote

04:04:08.790 --> 04:04:08.800 align:start position:0%
quote
 
04:04:11.189 --> 04:04:11.199 align:start position:0%
the governor May suspend or limit
 
04:04:14.790 --> 04:04:14.800 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights during a state of
 
04:04:16.670 --> 04:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
emergency so looking around New
 
04:04:18.070 --> 04:04:18.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you might not guess that we're
 
04:04:19.670 --> 04:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
living in a world where where
 
04:04:21.510 --> 04:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights uh can be
 
04:04:23.630 --> 04:04:23.640 align:start position:0%
suspended um churches are not closed
 
04:04:25.110 --> 04:04:25.120 align:start position:0%
guns have not been
 
04:04:27.469 --> 04:04:27.479 align:start position:0%
confiscated and citizens are not being
 
04:04:28.950 --> 04:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
pulled off the street and held without
 
04:04:32.910 --> 04:04:32.920 align:start position:0%
due process however uh we are somewhat
 
04:04:34.870 --> 04:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
interestingly living in a situation
 
04:04:36.550 --> 04:04:36.560 align:start position:0%
right now in which the state of New
 
04:04:38.870 --> 04:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire takes the position that we do
 
04:04:41.149 --> 04:04:41.159 align:start position:0%
not have enforcable legal rights under
 
04:04:43.469 --> 04:04:43.479 align:start position:0%
the US and state
 
04:04:45.429 --> 04:04:45.439 align:start position:0%
constitutions when a governor issues
 
04:04:47.429 --> 04:04:47.439 align:start position:0%
emergency orders he acts under the
 
04:04:49.469 --> 04:04:49.479 align:start position:0%
emergency Powers delegated to him under
 
04:04:51.550 --> 04:04:51.560 align:start position:0%
RSA 445 and
 
04:04:55.429 --> 04:04:55.439 align:start position:0%
47 the proposed amendment simply add a
 
04:04:58.189 --> 04:04:58.199 align:start position:0%
clarification and I would direct you to
 
04:05:00.110 --> 04:05:00.120 align:start position:0%
section six of the proposed amendment
 
04:05:01.910 --> 04:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
which really contains the the relevant
 
04:05:04.510 --> 04:05:04.520 align:start position:0%
language here it's two short paragraphs
 
04:05:06.590 --> 04:05:06.600 align:start position:0%
and they are almost a repeat of each
 
04:05:09.149 --> 04:05:09.159 align:start position:0%
other uh the proposed amendment simply
 
04:05:12.269 --> 04:05:12.279 align:start position:0%
adds the clarification that quote civil
 
04:05:14.429 --> 04:05:14.439 align:start position:0%
liberties shall on no account be
 
04:05:16.830 --> 04:05:16.840 align:start position:0%
suspended nor shall the United States
 
04:05:18.750 --> 04:05:18.760 align:start position:0%
Constitution or the New Hampshire Bill
 
04:05:21.550 --> 04:05:21.560 align:start position:0%
of Rights be suspended set aside or
 
04:05:25.590 --> 04:05:25.600 align:start position:0%
infringed so that is a very uh narrowly
 
04:05:27.550 --> 04:05:27.560 align:start position:0%
defined uh
 
04:05:31.070 --> 04:05:31.080 align:start position:0%
clarification very limited in scope um
 
04:05:33.070 --> 04:05:33.080 align:start position:0%
clarifying the legislator's intent
 
04:05:34.950 --> 04:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
concerning the governor's emergency
 
04:05:37.229 --> 04:05:37.239 align:start position:0%
powers that would bring us into the
 
04:05:39.309 --> 04:05:39.319 align:start position:0%
company of multiple other jurisdictions
 
04:05:41.149 --> 04:05:41.159 align:start position:0%
around the country including
 
04:05:44.030 --> 04:05:44.040 align:start position:0%
Maine uh the governor currently has
 
04:05:46.469 --> 04:05:46.479 align:start position:0%
enumerated powers actually very flexible
 
04:05:48.309 --> 04:05:48.319 align:start position:0%
enumerated powers to deal with an
 
04:05:51.389 --> 04:05:51.399 align:start position:0%
emergency and this would not change that
 
04:05:52.830 --> 04:05:52.840 align:start position:0%
it would simply ensure that in
 
04:05:54.349 --> 04:05:54.359 align:start position:0%
challenges to any of the governor's
 
04:05:57.189 --> 04:05:57.199 align:start position:0%
actions or any future Governor's actions
 
04:05:58.870 --> 04:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
the courts would need to conduct an
 
04:06:01.910 --> 04:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
ordinary constitutional analysis rather
 
04:06:03.349 --> 04:06:03.359 align:start position:0%
than simply declaring that civil
 
04:06:06.510 --> 04:06:06.520 align:start position:0%
liberties are suspended and with that I
 
04:06:09.389 --> 04:06:09.399 align:start position:0%
uh I will take any questions
 
04:06:16.630 --> 04:06:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:19.870 --> 04:06:19.880 align:start position:0%
Horan now I'm unmuted oh thank you very
 
04:06:21.790 --> 04:06:21.800 align:start position:0%
much Mr chair and thank you rent kall
 
04:06:24.269 --> 04:06:24.279 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um you had a
 
04:06:27.149 --> 04:06:27.159 align:start position:0%
quote from James Madison um which I
 
04:06:29.269 --> 04:06:29.279 align:start position:0%
guess is something you're planning to is
 
04:06:30.269 --> 04:06:30.279 align:start position:0%
a quote from something called the
 
04:06:32.030 --> 04:06:32.040 align:start position:0%
memorial and remonstrance against
 
04:06:35.670 --> 04:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
religious assessments um so what's which
 
04:06:37.429 --> 04:06:37.439 align:start position:0%
is actually it's not in the amendment
 
04:06:38.830 --> 04:06:38.840 align:start position:0%
but what's the
 
04:06:41.149 --> 04:06:41.159 align:start position:0%
uh what was that in the what was the
 
04:06:43.070 --> 04:06:43.080 align:start position:0%
larger context for that like what was
 
04:06:47.309 --> 04:06:47.319 align:start position:0%
that um what was the large what was of
 
04:06:49.950 --> 04:06:49.960 align:start position:0%
course relig in a religious assessment
 
04:06:52.830 --> 04:06:52.840 align:start position:0%
sounds like uh I know New Hampshire and
 
04:06:55.630 --> 04:06:55.640 align:start position:0%
most other states like the state used to
 
04:06:57.630 --> 04:06:57.640 align:start position:0%
support at least certain religions which
 
04:07:00.510 --> 04:07:00.520 align:start position:0%
they don't directly do anymore although
 
04:07:03.790 --> 04:07:03.800 align:start position:0%
um we do get property tax exemptions and
 
04:07:05.269 --> 04:07:05.279 align:start position:0%
other benefits so what what was the
 
04:07:07.349 --> 04:07:07.359 align:start position:0%
context for that quote you started out
 
04:07:07.359 --> 04:07:09.189 align:start position:0%
context for that quote you started out
with

04:07:09.189 --> 04:07:09.199 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:07:11.830 --> 04:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
um to be to be honest I I I don't I put
 
04:07:13.870 --> 04:07:13.880 align:start position:0%
together my notes uh some time ago and I
 
04:07:16.469 --> 04:07:16.479 align:start position:0%
don't recall the exact context of
 
04:07:21.030 --> 04:07:21.040 align:start position:0%
that okay fair enough a followup um and
 
04:07:24.670 --> 04:07:24.680 align:start position:0%
so what the definition I mean like I see
 
04:07:26.189 --> 04:07:26.199 align:start position:0%
St with religious organizations and
 
04:07:29.030 --> 04:07:29.040 align:start position:0%
religion so what's what's to stop just
 
04:07:32.030 --> 04:07:32.040 align:start position:0%
somebody from just creating a uh
 
04:07:33.630 --> 04:07:33.640 align:start position:0%
creating just any type of organization
 
04:07:35.349 --> 04:07:35.359 align:start position:0%
and calling it a religious organization
 
04:07:37.030 --> 04:07:37.040 align:start position:0%
and then thus exempting themselves from
 
04:07:39.109 --> 04:07:39.119 align:start position:0%
Rel lease uh
 
04:07:42.710 --> 04:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
some laws so like where's the where's
 
04:07:46.870 --> 04:07:46.880 align:start position:0%
the where's the protection the so what
 
04:07:49.870 --> 04:07:49.880 align:start position:0%
that's that's a great question um there
 
04:07:51.950 --> 04:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
have and so as I was as I was
 
04:07:54.510 --> 04:07:54.520 align:start position:0%
researching uh some of the case law
 
04:07:57.149 --> 04:07:57.159 align:start position:0%
surrounding um surrounding religious
 
04:07:59.670 --> 04:07:59.680 align:start position:0%
liberty that is one concern or objection
 
04:08:03.510 --> 04:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
that comes up fairly frequently um in in
 
04:08:06.910 --> 04:08:06.920 align:start position:0%
actual case law however um we don't we
 
04:08:09.149 --> 04:08:09.159 align:start position:0%
we have not seen that happen um in other
 
04:08:12.189 --> 04:08:12.199 align:start position:0%
words the the courts have uh have done a
 
04:08:14.469 --> 04:08:14.479 align:start position:0%
a fairly good job of distinguishing
 
04:08:16.710 --> 04:08:16.720 align:start position:0%
between um or quite a good job I would
 
04:08:19.030 --> 04:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
say of distinguishing between uh
 
04:08:23.070 --> 04:08:23.080 align:start position:0%
Bonafide religious uh religious liberty
 
04:08:27.030 --> 04:08:27.040 align:start position:0%
cases and um you know in in cases in
 
04:08:30.870 --> 04:08:30.880 align:start position:0%
which someone comes up with uh sort of
 
04:08:33.109 --> 04:08:33.119 align:start position:0%
using religious liberty as as kind of a
 
04:08:36.750 --> 04:08:36.760 align:start position:0%
shield for uh for activity that would
 
04:08:38.990 --> 04:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
otherwise be
 
04:08:41.550 --> 04:08:41.560 align:start position:0%
prohibited okay thank you very much
 
04:08:43.950 --> 04:08:43.960 align:start position:0%
thanks representative
 
04:08:46.630 --> 04:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
Kelly thank you Mr chair and um thank
 
04:08:47.710 --> 04:08:47.720 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
04:08:50.030 --> 04:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
representative kofalt um could you give
 
04:08:53.030 --> 04:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
a specific example of the kind of future
 
04:08:55.070 --> 04:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
case you're worried might happen if
 
04:08:57.750 --> 04:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
civil liberties can be
 
04:09:02.429 --> 04:09:02.439 align:start position:0%
suspended well um I I can tell you that
 
04:09:04.830 --> 04:09:04.840 align:start position:0%
you know in in the case of religious
 
04:09:08.229 --> 04:09:08.239 align:start position:0%
liberty generally speaking um the the
 
04:09:10.950 --> 04:09:10.960 align:start position:0%
Mac case actually is is which I I
 
04:09:13.189 --> 04:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh in my testimony is actually
 
04:09:14.750 --> 04:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
an interesting example because that was
 
04:09:17.229 --> 04:09:17.239 align:start position:0%
an example pertaining to the religious
 
04:09:19.550 --> 04:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
use of psilocybe and mushrooms which are
 
04:09:23.070 --> 04:09:23.080 align:start position:0%
psychedelic and um in this case uh the
 
04:09:26.189 --> 04:09:26.199 align:start position:0%
defendant was um actually was part of a
 
04:09:28.389 --> 04:09:28.399 align:start position:0%
legitimate uh Bonafide
 
04:09:32.389 --> 04:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
religious um organization that that uh
 
04:09:36.070 --> 04:09:36.080 align:start position:0%
used those in you know as part of their
 
04:09:39.590 --> 04:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh religious ritual R and ceremonies um
 
04:09:43.349 --> 04:09:43.359 align:start position:0%
and so you know this this was where um I
 
04:09:46.670 --> 04:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
mean the distinction really is that the
 
04:09:49.349 --> 04:09:49.359 align:start position:0%
the state must make a compelling case
 
04:09:52.590 --> 04:09:52.600 align:start position:0%
there if if an activity is otherwise
 
04:09:54.550 --> 04:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
prohibited um such as the use of
 
04:09:57.349 --> 04:09:57.359 align:start position:0%
psilocybin mushrooms um if a case is
 
04:09:57.359 --> 04:09:58.510 align:start position:0%
psilocybin mushrooms um if a case is
otherwise

04:09:58.510 --> 04:09:58.520 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
04:10:01.109 --> 04:10:01.119 align:start position:0%
prohibited um or generally prohibited I
 
04:10:05.429 --> 04:10:05.439 align:start position:0%
should say um the the the Supreme Court
 
04:10:08.630 --> 04:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
rulings uh throughout most of of history
 
04:10:11.469 --> 04:10:11.479 align:start position:0%
have taken the position that um
 
04:10:15.630 --> 04:10:15.640 align:start position:0%
religious liberty would Prevail unless
 
04:10:18.389 --> 04:10:18.399 align:start position:0%
the state can demonstrate a compelling
 
04:10:22.870 --> 04:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
interest um in the prohibition um so uh
 
04:10:25.389 --> 04:10:25.399 align:start position:0%
in that case there was not a compelling
 
04:10:28.870 --> 04:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
interest in the prohibition I think
 
04:10:31.710 --> 04:10:31.720 align:start position:0%
there have been some concerns about uh
 
04:10:35.109 --> 04:10:35.119 align:start position:0%
prohibitions on uh religious gatherings
 
04:10:37.510 --> 04:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
um during emergencies um the the the
 
04:10:39.229 --> 04:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
bill actually would not the the bill was
 
04:10:42.070 --> 04:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
not intended uh as as originally written
 
04:10:45.389 --> 04:10:45.399 align:start position:0%
was not ever intended to uh to to stand
 
04:10:49.790 --> 04:10:49.800 align:start position:0%
in the way of of those uh but uh there
 
04:10:51.550 --> 04:10:51.560 align:start position:0%
there have been other CA there's there's
 
04:10:55.269 --> 04:10:55.279 align:start position:0%
been other case law um one and I'm I'm
 
04:10:57.389 --> 04:10:57.399 align:start position:0%
trying to remember the uh the citation
 
04:10:58.750 --> 04:10:58.760 align:start position:0%
but there was a Supreme Court case
 
04:11:01.870 --> 04:11:01.880 align:start position:0%
involving the collection of sales taxes
 
04:11:05.070 --> 04:11:05.080 align:start position:0%
um in Utah when someone was selling
 
04:11:07.990 --> 04:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
religious pamphlets and tracks and uh
 
04:11:10.429 --> 04:11:10.439 align:start position:0%
they claimed exemption from sales tax
 
04:11:13.790 --> 04:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
because it was uh a religious activity
 
04:11:15.469 --> 04:11:15.479 align:start position:0%
uh it went to the US Supreme Court and
 
04:11:18.189 --> 04:11:18.199 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court ruled that um there
 
04:11:21.950 --> 04:11:21.960 align:start position:0%
was ultimately a uh a compelling uh
 
04:11:23.469 --> 04:11:23.479 align:start position:0%
there was not ultimately a compelling
 
04:11:25.990 --> 04:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
State interest and um that it was
 
04:11:27.710 --> 04:11:27.720 align:start position:0%
protected religious activity protected
 
04:11:30.990 --> 04:11:31.000 align:start position:0%
from sales tax um there was a similar
 
04:11:35.189 --> 04:11:35.199 align:start position:0%
case involving a um a a a plaintiff who
 
04:11:38.590 --> 04:11:38.600 align:start position:0%
who sued a state that had denied her uh
 
04:11:41.429 --> 04:11:41.439 align:start position:0%
Unemployment uh claims because she was a
 
04:11:43.590 --> 04:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
Seventh Day Adventist she refused to
 
04:11:45.790 --> 04:11:45.800 align:start position:0%
work on Sunday she was fired from her
 
04:11:48.269 --> 04:11:48.279 align:start position:0%
job went to collect unemployment and was
 
04:11:51.469 --> 04:11:51.479 align:start position:0%
told that um you know you you you don't
 
04:11:54.070 --> 04:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
really get unemployment and uh because
 
04:11:56.790 --> 04:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
you you refused to work on Sunday and so
 
04:11:58.349 --> 04:11:58.359 align:start position:0%
again the state was unable to
 
04:12:01.229 --> 04:12:01.239 align:start position:0%
demonstrate a compelling State interest
 
04:12:04.429 --> 04:12:04.439 align:start position:0%
in uh in in in in the position of not
 
04:12:06.510 --> 04:12:06.520 align:start position:0%
paying unemployment in that case so
 
04:12:08.750 --> 04:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
these are these some of the kind of uh
 
04:12:11.830 --> 04:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
borderline cases again the Mac decision
 
04:12:15.590 --> 04:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
effectively establishes um a clear you
 
04:12:18.030 --> 04:12:18.040 align:start position:0%
know a a clear line for how those should
 
04:12:19.990 --> 04:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
be decided which is that they should
 
04:12:21.510 --> 04:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
come down on the side of religious
 
04:12:23.710 --> 04:12:23.720 align:start position:0%
liberty the concern is that we are
 
04:12:26.870 --> 04:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
living in a situation right now under uh
 
04:12:28.510 --> 04:12:28.520 align:start position:0%
under the Superior Court decision from
 
04:12:31.510 --> 04:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
last year that effectively says quote
 
04:12:35.510 --> 04:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
civil liberty um the the governor may
 
04:12:36.710 --> 04:12:36.720 align:start position:0%
let me find the quote the governor May
 
04:12:38.750 --> 04:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
suspend or limit constitutional rights
 
04:12:41.070 --> 04:12:41.080 align:start position:0%
during a state of emergency that calls
 
04:12:43.429 --> 04:12:43.439 align:start position:0%
into question all of our constitutional
 
04:12:47.269 --> 04:12:47.279 align:start position:0%
rights um and you know in that respect
 
04:12:49.510 --> 04:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
you know this really is you know it
 
04:12:53.269 --> 04:12:53.279 align:start position:0%
remains uh a a protection of religious
 
04:12:56.550 --> 04:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
liberty but in many respects it is a uh
 
04:12:59.510 --> 04:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
a protection of of all civil liberties
 
04:13:02.189 --> 04:13:02.199 align:start position:0%
um by clarifying the legislator's intent
 
04:13:04.670 --> 04:13:04.680 align:start position:0%
that emergency powers are not intended
 
04:13:07.510 --> 04:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
to um to to allow the government to
 
04:13:11.870 --> 04:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
override suspend or limit constitutional
 
04:13:14.429 --> 04:13:14.439 align:start position:0%
rights um I have just one more quick
 
04:13:17.389 --> 04:13:17.399 align:start position:0%
question um if I may uh is there a
 
04:13:19.429 --> 04:13:19.439 align:start position:0%
possibility that even if this bill
 
04:13:22.030 --> 04:13:22.040 align:start position:0%
passes with the amendment um a governor
 
04:13:24.149 --> 04:13:24.159 align:start position:0%
could still suspend Civ civil liberties
 
04:13:28.109 --> 04:13:28.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:28.119 --> 04:13:29.630 align:start position:0%
 
powers

04:13:29.630 --> 04:13:29.640 align:start position:0%
powers
 
04:13:33.670 --> 04:13:33.680 align:start position:0%
um I I don't know um I I actually I know
 
04:13:36.670 --> 04:13:36.680 align:start position:0%
that there is uh someone who I think was
 
04:13:39.109 --> 04:13:39.119 align:start position:0%
trying to sign up to testify I believe
 
04:13:41.990 --> 04:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
he was not he he he called me shortly
 
04:13:44.030 --> 04:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
before this hearing and told me that he
 
04:13:47.429 --> 04:13:47.439 align:start position:0%
was unable to uncheck the Box uh
 
04:13:49.469 --> 04:13:49.479 align:start position:0%
indicating that he was he wants to
 
04:13:52.990 --> 04:13:53.000 align:start position:0%
testify um Ian hwit is uh should be on
 
04:13:55.229 --> 04:13:55.239 align:start position:0%
the line and and probably raising his
 
04:13:57.109 --> 04:13:57.119 align:start position:0%
hand uh but he would be the better
 
04:13:59.710 --> 04:13:59.720 align:start position:0%
person to ask that question I
 
04:14:02.630 --> 04:14:02.640 align:start position:0%
think very good thank
 
04:14:05.149 --> 04:14:05.159 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
04:14:07.870 --> 04:14:07.880 align:start position:0%
Burch thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:14:11.670 --> 04:14:11.680 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question um
 
04:14:14.389 --> 04:14:14.399 align:start position:0%
my question is a followup a bit to
 
04:14:16.950 --> 04:14:16.960 align:start position:0%
representative Horgan's question and
 
04:14:21.710 --> 04:14:21.720 align:start position:0%

responses
 
04:14:26.229 --> 04:14:26.239 align:start position:0%
um I read the Mad case a little
 
04:14:29.030 --> 04:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
differently than you do
 
04:14:31.429 --> 04:14:31.439 align:start position:0%
but uh isn't it
 
04:14:31.439 --> 04:14:33.630 align:start position:0%
but uh isn't it
true

04:14:33.630 --> 04:14:33.640 align:start position:0%
true
 
04:14:37.109 --> 04:14:37.119 align:start position:0%
that the New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
04:14:42.189 --> 04:14:42.199 align:start position:0%
basically said that anyone can can
 
04:14:44.590 --> 04:14:44.600 align:start position:0%
entertain what religious thoughts they
 
04:14:47.389 --> 04:14:47.399 align:start position:0%
wish and make a religion out of them and
 
04:14:50.750 --> 04:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
that the courts can't step in and decide
 
04:14:53.070 --> 04:14:53.080 align:start position:0%
what's theologically correct and what's
 
04:14:57.229 --> 04:14:57.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:02.109 --> 04:15:02.119 align:start position:0%
nonsense um again I would I would
 
04:15:05.109 --> 04:15:05.119 align:start position:0%
perhaps defer to attorney huitt on the
 
04:15:07.429 --> 04:15:07.439 align:start position:0%
on on a more detailed analysis of that
 
04:15:10.189 --> 04:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
my understanding of the Court's position
 
04:15:13.710 --> 04:15:13.720 align:start position:0%
is that it is not their uh place to
 
04:15:16.309 --> 04:15:16.319 align:start position:0%
determine uh the the theological
 
04:15:19.469 --> 04:15:19.479 align:start position:0%
correctness but it it is their their
 
04:15:22.429 --> 04:15:22.439 align:start position:0%
position that they may uh determine what
 
04:15:26.550 --> 04:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
is a a legitimate Bonafide uh religious
 
04:15:29.750 --> 04:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh activity versus uh versus what is not
 
04:15:32.550 --> 04:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
but I I would ultimately defer to uh to
 
04:15:34.030 --> 04:15:34.040 align:start position:0%
Ian hu on that
 
04:15:37.750 --> 04:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
one if I could follow up
 
04:15:40.149 --> 04:15:40.159 align:start position:0%
um actually I think in the in the MA
 
04:15:43.309 --> 04:15:43.319 align:start position:0%
case the uh it was stipulated that this
 
04:15:46.550 --> 04:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
was a Bonafide religious practice the
 
04:15:49.590 --> 04:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
the the cocy and stuff my question to
 
04:15:53.429 --> 04:15:53.439 align:start position:0%
you further is you talked about the tax
 
04:15:56.349 --> 04:15:56.359 align:start position:0%
people in Utah uh not wanting to pay the
 
04:15:59.389 --> 04:15:59.399 align:start position:0%
sales tax or or whatever kind of tax you
 
04:16:03.269 --> 04:16:03.279 align:start position:0%
refer to um would your bill affect a
 
04:16:06.590 --> 04:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
situation that has arisen in in my neck
 
04:16:11.349 --> 04:16:11.359 align:start position:0%
of the Woods in New Hampshire where um
 
04:16:14.149 --> 04:16:14.159 align:start position:0%
uh I say this without any negative
 
04:16:17.790 --> 04:16:17.800 align:start position:0%
connotation the free Staters uh in in
 
04:16:23.229 --> 04:16:23.239 align:start position:0%
our area uh decided uh in order to uh
 
04:16:26.429 --> 04:16:26.439 align:start position:0%
not pay property taxes to incorporate
 
04:16:30.189 --> 04:16:30.199 align:start position:0%
themselves as a church and did so and
 
04:16:33.750 --> 04:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
gave themselves uh religious titles and
 
04:16:37.990 --> 04:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
then litigated with the town of Keen or
 
04:16:40.269 --> 04:16:40.279 align:start position:0%
city of Kean whether they would have to
 
04:16:45.670 --> 04:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
pay uh uh taxes or not uh are you
 
04:16:49.630 --> 04:16:49.640 align:start position:0%
suggesting uh that this legislation of
 
04:16:54.349 --> 04:16:54.359 align:start position:0%
yours um would bless that to use that
 
04:16:59.149 --> 04:16:59.159 align:start position:0%
term would bless that effort uh and that
 
04:17:01.990 --> 04:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps we could all uh turn our homes
 
04:17:04.670 --> 04:17:04.680 align:start position:0%
into churches and avoid paying uh
 
04:17:04.680 --> 04:17:05.790 align:start position:0%
into churches and avoid paying uh
property

04:17:05.790 --> 04:17:05.800 align:start position:0%
property
 
04:17:05.800 --> 04:17:07.950 align:start position:0%
property
taxes

04:17:07.950 --> 04:17:07.960 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
04:17:10.070 --> 04:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
uh this this legislation as amended
 
04:17:12.269 --> 04:17:12.279 align:start position:0%
would would actually not do any such
 
04:17:14.550 --> 04:17:14.560 align:start position:0%
thing it it it would be quite narrow in
 
04:17:18.550 --> 04:17:18.560 align:start position:0%
Focus as I said it would establish that
 
04:17:21.510 --> 04:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
the governor May under no circumstances
 
04:17:23.510 --> 04:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
limit or suspend constitutional rights
 
04:17:27.189 --> 04:17:27.199 align:start position:0%
under under the emergency Powers um in
 
04:17:31.950 --> 04:17:31.960 align:start position:0%
RSA 445 and 47 so it it really it it it
 
04:17:35.149 --> 04:17:35.159 align:start position:0%
pertains um as as it is written right
 
04:17:38.630 --> 04:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
now or written in the amend mment uh it
 
04:17:41.349 --> 04:17:41.359 align:start position:0%
it would it would pertain specifically
 
04:17:44.349 --> 04:17:44.359 align:start position:0%
to um the the question of whether the
 
04:17:46.630 --> 04:17:46.640 align:start position:0%
emergency Powers may be suspended or
 
04:17:47.990 --> 04:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
whether constitutional rights may be
 
04:17:49.750 --> 04:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
suspended or limited under under the
 
04:17:52.429 --> 04:17:52.439 align:start position:0%
emergency power
 
04:17:55.910 --> 04:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:58.269 --> 04:17:58.279 align:start position:0%
you are there any other questions for
 
04:17:58.279 --> 04:18:00.670 align:start position:0%
you are there any other questions for
representative

04:18:00.670 --> 04:18:00.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:18:03.309 --> 04:18:03.319 align:start position:0%
Kofa seeing none thank you for your
 
04:18:03.319 --> 04:18:05.189 align:start position:0%
Kofa seeing none thank you for your
testimony

04:18:05.189 --> 04:18:05.199 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
04:18:07.349 --> 04:18:07.359 align:start position:0%
today thank you
 
04:18:09.990 --> 04:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
and uh I think since we're talking about
 
04:18:11.670 --> 04:18:11.680 align:start position:0%
a potential Amendment I'm going to call
 
04:18:14.630 --> 04:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
upon representative Sylvia next and he
 
04:18:19.349 --> 04:18:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:23.750 --> 04:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
think sorry thank you Mr chairman
 
04:18:26.790 --> 04:18:26.800 align:start position:0%
um representative kofalt brought this
 
04:18:31.070 --> 04:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
idea to me and I certainly uh am very
 
04:18:34.469 --> 04:18:34.479 align:start position:0%
much supportive of this um where he
 
04:18:36.910 --> 04:18:36.920 align:start position:0%
initially started out in uh part for
 
04:18:40.070 --> 04:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
Article Five I think we can now look to
 
04:18:44.030 --> 04:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
part first article 10 where we uh affirm
 
04:18:47.870 --> 04:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
the the rights of uh all people in the
 
04:18:50.830 --> 04:18:50.840 align:start position:0%
State uh without regard to any special
 
04:18:55.389 --> 04:18:55.399 align:start position:0%
classes of U men or people or or even
 
04:18:59.830 --> 04:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
religions so um I I fully support this
 
04:19:03.349 --> 04:19:03.359 align:start position:0%
uh Amendment and I I think it's a great
 
04:19:07.229 --> 04:19:07.239 align:start position:0%
uh tool particularly in the case of
 
04:19:10.670 --> 04:19:10.680 align:start position:0%
these emergency powers that we uh we
 
04:19:15.309 --> 04:19:15.319 align:start position:0%
need to be able to uh challenge any
 
04:19:19.510 --> 04:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional um orders produced by
 
04:19:19.520 --> 04:19:23.670 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional um orders produced by
the

04:19:23.670 --> 04:19:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:25.429 --> 04:19:25.439 align:start position:0%
executive any questions for
 
04:19:25.439 --> 04:19:30.109 align:start position:0%
executive any questions for
representative

04:19:30.109 --> 04:19:30.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:33.109 --> 04:19:33.119 align:start position:0%
Sylvia representative syia if I just
 
04:19:35.109 --> 04:19:35.119 align:start position:0%
that the amendment and I'm sorry I don't
 
04:19:36.469 --> 04:19:36.479 align:start position:0%
have it in front of me and I'm afraid to
 
04:19:36.479 --> 04:19:37.510 align:start position:0%
have it in front of me and I'm afraid to
go

04:19:37.510 --> 04:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
go
 
04:19:40.750 --> 04:19:40.760 align:start position:0%
out of the zoom and do that because I'm
 
04:19:42.550 --> 04:19:42.560 align:start position:0%
afraid I'll screw up my zoom connection
 
04:19:46.389 --> 04:19:46.399 align:start position:0%
but uh so I'm just asking did the U the
 
04:19:49.269 --> 04:19:49.279 align:start position:0%
amendment I thought I heard them say at
 
04:19:51.149 --> 04:19:51.159 align:start position:0%
the beginning that the amendment would
 
04:19:55.389 --> 04:19:55.399 align:start position:0%
replace bill as it's currently written
 
04:19:59.349 --> 04:19:59.359 align:start position:0%
correct and I also think I heard it said
 
04:20:01.309 --> 04:20:01.319 align:start position:0%
that the amendment was just two
 
04:20:05.550 --> 04:20:05.560 align:start position:0%
paragraphs is that uh so there is a lot
 
04:20:09.349 --> 04:20:09.359 align:start position:0%
of preamble to it uh the first five
 
04:20:12.109 --> 04:20:12.119 align:start position:0%
sections and then uh section six and
 
04:20:14.670 --> 04:20:14.680 align:start position:0%
seven get down to uh the actual
 
04:20:14.680 --> 04:20:17.510 align:start position:0%
seven get down to uh the actual
statutory

04:20:17.510 --> 04:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:21.870 --> 04:20:21.880 align:start position:0%
language um so there's uh there's just a
 
04:20:23.149 --> 04:20:23.159 align:start position:0%
couple of sections
 
04:20:28.229 --> 04:20:28.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:31.870 --> 04:20:31.880 align:start position:0%
acts okay thank you representative
 
04:20:34.229 --> 04:20:34.239 align:start position:0%
Horgan thank you very much Mr chair
 
04:20:37.269 --> 04:20:37.279 align:start position:0%
thank you siia um
 
04:20:41.429 --> 04:20:41.439 align:start position:0%
do you feel like expounding on which of
 
04:20:43.950 --> 04:20:43.960 align:start position:0%
the uh urgency Powers were
 
04:20:45.990 --> 04:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional and which aren't um so
 
04:20:49.469 --> 04:20:49.479 align:start position:0%
like what exactly was it based on an
 
04:20:50.790 --> 04:20:50.800 align:start position:0%
experience over the last year that
 
04:20:52.109 --> 04:20:52.119 align:start position:0%
you're trying to prevent from happening
 
04:20:53.469 --> 04:20:53.479 align:start position:0%
in future should you know we have
 
04:20:56.750 --> 04:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
another uh pandemic or other catastrophe
 
04:20:58.109 --> 04:20:58.119 align:start position:0%
that you know kills half a million
 
04:21:00.189 --> 04:21:00.199 align:start position:0%
Americans between 12200 here in the US
 
04:21:01.990 --> 04:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
so which one any that you're
 
04:21:03.510 --> 04:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
particularly concerned about in
 
04:21:06.229 --> 04:21:06.239 align:start position:0%
particular thank you thank you for the
 
04:21:09.030 --> 04:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
question representative Oregan um I
 
04:21:11.349 --> 04:21:11.359 align:start position:0%
think that there is a there is a fairly
 
04:21:14.469 --> 04:21:14.479 align:start position:0%
serious question about the ability of
 
04:21:17.710 --> 04:21:17.720 align:start position:0%
the legislature to delegate powers to
 
04:21:23.309 --> 04:21:23.319 align:start position:0%
make law and that uh that question is
 
04:21:26.429 --> 04:21:26.439 align:start position:0%
part of a one of the
 
04:21:30.189 --> 04:21:30.199 align:start position:0%
remonstrances and frankly we should take
 
04:21:32.910 --> 04:21:32.920 align:start position:0%
it up and we should uh make clear
 
04:21:36.990 --> 04:21:37.000 align:start position:0%
whether or not uh the the delegation of
 
04:21:39.349 --> 04:21:39.359 align:start position:0%
that Authority is actually within the
 
04:21:41.510 --> 04:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
Constitution and uh
 
04:21:44.189 --> 04:21:44.199 align:start position:0%
perhaps attorney huitt when he comes up
 
04:21:47.510 --> 04:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
will maybe address that a little
 
04:21:51.309 --> 04:21:51.319 align:start position:0%
bit um okay I I get it I mean this is I
 
04:21:53.349 --> 04:21:53.359 align:start position:0%
don't want to get in territory we would
 
04:21:56.830 --> 04:21:56.840 align:start position:0%
want to with the excutive session but uh
 
04:21:59.950 --> 04:21:59.960 align:start position:0%
I guess is it uh isn't true the
 
04:22:02.910 --> 04:22:02.920 align:start position:0%
legislature did eventually find a way to
 
04:22:05.790 --> 04:22:05.800 align:start position:0%
uh come back um within you know within
 
04:22:07.389 --> 04:22:07.399 align:start position:0%
three months of when the pandemic was
 
04:22:10.030 --> 04:22:10.040 align:start position:0%
and they probably were trying to do it
 
04:22:10.040 --> 04:22:12.030 align:start position:0%
and they probably were trying to do it
earlier

04:22:12.030 --> 04:22:12.040 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
04:22:15.670 --> 04:22:15.680 align:start position:0%
or so Greek so you how do you feel so do
 
04:22:17.469 --> 04:22:17.479 align:start position:0%
you have any comment on on that aspect
 
04:22:19.510 --> 04:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
of the fact that you know at least and
 
04:22:21.830 --> 04:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
there are like some legislative like
 
04:22:23.229 --> 04:22:23.239 align:start position:0%
there for example The Joint fiscal
 
04:22:25.109 --> 04:22:25.119 align:start position:0%
committee attempted to continue did
 
04:22:27.469 --> 04:22:27.479 align:start position:0%
continue meeting but then the uh
 
04:22:29.429 --> 04:22:29.439 align:start position:0%
Governor never referred any of the uh
 
04:22:32.309 --> 04:22:32.319 align:start position:0%
emergency uh expenditures to it that's a
 
04:22:34.229 --> 04:22:34.239 align:start position:0%
little bit off the topic of religious
 
04:22:38.189 --> 04:22:38.199 align:start position:0%
liberty but right well as as the bill is
 
04:22:41.429 --> 04:22:41.439 align:start position:0%
amended um when when the legislature
 
04:22:41.439 --> 04:22:42.309 align:start position:0%
amended um when when the legislature
comes

04:22:42.309 --> 04:22:42.319 align:start position:0%
comes
 
04:22:46.710 --> 04:22:46.720 align:start position:0%
back a lot of these uh emergency orders
 
04:22:48.870 --> 04:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
um could be done
 
04:22:51.229 --> 04:22:51.239 align:start position:0%
legislatively and obviously it's a much
 
04:22:51.239 --> 04:22:52.309 align:start position:0%
legislatively and obviously it's a much
slower

04:22:52.309 --> 04:22:52.319 align:start position:0%
slower
 
04:22:55.670 --> 04:22:55.680 align:start position:0%
process so the ability for the governor
 
04:22:58.309 --> 04:22:58.319 align:start position:0%
act we went uh you know a couple hundred
 
04:23:01.870 --> 04:23:01.880 align:start position:0%
years without these this this statute uh
 
04:23:07.830 --> 04:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
RSA 445 446 447 I'll be speaking to 446
 
04:23:10.870 --> 04:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
next Friday I believe
 
04:23:13.710 --> 04:23:13.720 align:start position:0%
and we we managed to get by we managed
 
04:23:16.070 --> 04:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
to get through the Civil War we got
 
04:23:18.189 --> 04:23:18.199 align:start position:0%
through the Spanish Flu we got through
 
04:23:20.229 --> 04:23:20.239 align:start position:0%
World War I World War
 
04:23:24.950 --> 04:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
II um we managed to keep the state from
 
04:23:29.389 --> 04:23:29.399 align:start position:0%
falling apart and I think that a lot of
 
04:23:35.030 --> 04:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:37.590 --> 04:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
superflous thank
 
04:23:39.229 --> 04:23:39.239 align:start position:0%
I could just jump in with a question
 
04:23:39.239 --> 04:23:40.389 align:start position:0%
I could just jump in with a question
representative

04:23:40.389 --> 04:23:40.399 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:23:40.399 --> 04:23:41.910 align:start position:0%
representative
Sylvia

04:23:41.910 --> 04:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
Sylvia
 
04:23:44.630 --> 04:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
if uh and
 
04:23:48.149 --> 04:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
and and that is I you know I can I can
 
04:23:50.790 --> 04:23:50.800 align:start position:0%
agree with you that there needs to be
 
04:23:54.429 --> 04:23:54.439 align:start position:0%
changes in emergency powers and my
 
04:23:56.750 --> 04:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
understanding is the only reason the
 
04:23:59.630 --> 04:23:59.640 align:start position:0%
governor has emergency Powers is because
 
04:24:02.070 --> 04:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
we've statutorily given him those
 
04:24:06.790 --> 04:24:06.800 align:start position:0%
emergency Powers so why
 
04:24:09.590 --> 04:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
uh and I I guess the question ultimately
 
04:24:12.710 --> 04:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
comes down to this why not address the
 
04:24:15.710 --> 04:24:15.720 align:start position:0%
concerns that have been expressed in
 
04:24:18.030 --> 04:24:18.040 align:start position:0%
terms of changing the governor's
 
04:24:20.790 --> 04:24:20.800 align:start position:0%
emergency powers or limiting them as
 
04:24:24.269 --> 04:24:24.279 align:start position:0%
opposed to this approach which seems
 
04:24:24.279 --> 04:24:26.870 align:start position:0%
opposed to this approach which seems
more

04:24:26.870 --> 04:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:28.830 --> 04:24:28.840 align:start position:0%
heavy-handed thank you for the question
 
04:24:32.309 --> 04:24:32.319 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um I I think we've been
 
04:24:35.389 --> 04:24:35.399 align:start position:0%
wrestling for quite some time about how
 
04:24:35.399 --> 04:24:37.269 align:start position:0%
wrestling for quite some time about how
to

04:24:37.269 --> 04:24:37.279 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:24:42.189 --> 04:24:42.199 align:start position:0%
uh get this whole system to work where
 
04:24:45.630 --> 04:24:45.640 align:start position:0%
everybody is uh in agreement and I think
 
04:24:48.670 --> 04:24:48.680 align:start position:0%
we're a long way away from that
 
04:24:52.030 --> 04:24:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:55.870 --> 04:24:55.880 align:start position:0%
know this is this is our I guess best
 
04:24:58.510 --> 04:24:58.520 align:start position:0%
attempt at coming up with something that
 
04:25:01.790 --> 04:25:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:05.070 --> 04:25:05.080 align:start position:0%
workable representative
 
04:25:05.080 --> 04:25:10.630 align:start position:0%
workable representative
Burch

04:25:10.630 --> 04:25:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:11.990 --> 04:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you
 
04:25:14.510 --> 04:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question I
 
04:25:17.550 --> 04:25:17.560 align:start position:0%
was looking at the language in section
 
04:25:22.109 --> 04:25:22.119 align:start position:0%
seven saying that uh it provided that
 
04:25:23.910 --> 04:25:23.920 align:start position:0%
civil liberty shall not otherwise be
 
04:25:26.590 --> 04:25:26.600 align:start position:0%
infringed in the time of emergency so
 
04:25:30.349 --> 04:25:30.359 align:start position:0%
let's say there's a mammoth flood in
 
04:25:33.710 --> 04:25:33.720 align:start position:0%
conquered and it's just a tremendous
 
04:25:36.790 --> 04:25:36.800 align:start position:0%
human disaster and an an emergency is
 
04:25:42.189 --> 04:25:42.199 align:start position:0%
going on and the governor wishes to
 
04:25:46.950 --> 04:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
say uh no uh large groups of people
 
04:25:50.269 --> 04:25:50.279 align:start position:0%
Shall Gather in the center part of of
 
04:25:52.990 --> 04:25:53.000 align:start position:0%
conquer because it's a disaster
 
04:25:56.070 --> 04:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
area are you suggesting by this bill
 
04:25:58.950 --> 04:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
that the governor should not be allowed
 
04:25:58.960 --> 04:25:59.910 align:start position:0%
that the governor should not be allowed
that

04:25:59.910 --> 04:25:59.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:26:03.750 --> 04:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
power actually I I would uh I would say
 
04:26:06.670 --> 04:26:06.680 align:start position:0%
yes I mean let's look at uh
 
04:26:09.389 --> 04:26:09.399 align:start position:0%
if we use your example we can look at uh
 
04:26:12.389 --> 04:26:12.399 align:start position:0%
Katrina and the uh the flood there there
 
04:26:15.189 --> 04:26:15.199 align:start position:0%
was that uh those folks that came out
 
04:26:18.149 --> 04:26:18.159 align:start position:0%
with their boats to come to the rescue
 
04:26:22.030 --> 04:26:22.040 align:start position:0%
and they were stopped from uh assisting
 
04:26:24.429 --> 04:26:24.439 align:start position:0%
uh so we might have a large group of
 
04:26:27.269 --> 04:26:27.279 align:start position:0%
people coming together to help and the
 
04:26:31.229 --> 04:26:31.239 align:start position:0%
governor perhaps one person making that
 
04:26:33.670 --> 04:26:33.680 align:start position:0%
decision is not necessarily the smartest
 
04:26:36.429 --> 04:26:36.439 align:start position:0%
person sorry to say not speaking to
 
04:26:37.750 --> 04:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
anyone in
 
04:26:41.670 --> 04:26:41.680 align:start position:0%
particular uh so these things with the
 
04:26:45.149 --> 04:26:45.159 align:start position:0%
top- down central control
 
04:26:52.790 --> 04:26:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:55.950 --> 04:26:55.960 align:start position:0%
that I've got no further
 
04:26:58.630 --> 04:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
questions any other questions for
 
04:26:58.640 --> 04:27:00.189 align:start position:0%
questions any other questions for
representative

04:27:00.189 --> 04:27:00.199 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:27:04.910 --> 04:27:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:04.920 --> 04:27:08.429 align:start position:0%
 
Chase

04:27:08.429 --> 04:27:08.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:11.269 --> 04:27:11.279 align:start position:0%
so are you just you're saying
 
04:27:15.070 --> 04:27:15.080 align:start position:0%
that in a disaster or where other
 
04:27:17.950 --> 04:27:17.960 align:start position:0%
people's Health can be affected
 
04:27:20.630 --> 04:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
that you feel it's the right to still be
 
04:27:23.990 --> 04:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:26.670 --> 04:27:26.680 align:start position:0%
together basically is what I'm asking
 
04:27:29.189 --> 04:27:29.199 align:start position:0%
you because I could go on and on but you
 
04:27:32.510 --> 04:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
understand what I'm saying you just
 
04:27:35.229 --> 04:27:35.239 align:start position:0%
override I I do and actually the there
 
04:27:37.309 --> 04:27:37.319 align:start position:0%
the Constitution does speak in one
 
04:27:40.349 --> 04:27:40.359 align:start position:0%
section about um Health
 
04:27:42.910 --> 04:27:42.920 align:start position:0%
emergencies and there there is a time
 
04:27:45.429 --> 04:27:45.439 align:start position:0%
and a place for
 
04:27:49.030 --> 04:27:49.040 align:start position:0%
quarantines um so that is a power that's
 
04:27:51.149 --> 04:27:51.159 align:start position:0%
in the Constitution that the governor
 
04:27:54.429 --> 04:27:54.439 align:start position:0%
has but it's it's limited
 
04:28:00.510 --> 04:28:00.520 align:start position:0%
and U I think the current situation uh
 
04:28:02.750 --> 04:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
in my opinion does not reach the level
 
04:28:04.830 --> 04:28:04.840 align:start position:0%
of an
 
04:28:04.840 --> 04:28:07.189 align:start position:0%
of an
emergency

04:28:07.189 --> 04:28:07.199 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
04:28:10.830 --> 04:28:10.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you for the
 
04:28:13.670 --> 04:28:13.680 align:start position:0%
question okay any any other questions
 
04:28:15.910 --> 04:28:15.920 align:start position:0%
for representative
 
04:28:18.990 --> 04:28:19.000 align:start position:0%

who have pre-registered to testify
 
04:28:41.269 --> 04:28:41.279 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chairman and committee
 
04:28:51.189 --> 04:28:51.199 align:start position:0%
members um my name is Susan price I live
 
04:28:51.199 --> 04:28:52.189 align:start position:0%
members um my name is Susan price I live
in

04:28:52.189 --> 04:28:52.199 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:28:55.510 --> 04:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
molor I do support this bill I have not
 
04:28:57.109 --> 04:28:57.119 align:start position:0%
seen the amendment so I'll only be
 
04:29:01.750 --> 04:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
speaking to the uh the primary Bill my
 
04:29:03.590 --> 04:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
focus is on essential
 
04:29:06.630 --> 04:29:06.640 align:start position:0%
Services um those who do not
 
04:29:09.109 --> 04:29:09.119 align:start position:0%
um belong to a church or actively
 
04:29:12.429 --> 04:29:12.439 align:start position:0%
involved in a church may not understand
 
04:29:16.189 --> 04:29:16.199 align:start position:0%
that churches provide services Beyond
 
04:29:16.199 --> 04:29:17.790 align:start position:0%
that churches provide services Beyond
direct

04:29:17.790 --> 04:29:17.800 align:start position:0%
direct
 
04:29:20.670 --> 04:29:20.680 align:start position:0%
Ministry uh in the religious
 
04:29:23.429 --> 04:29:23.439 align:start position:0%
sense um so my focus and the reason I
 
04:29:25.790 --> 04:29:25.800 align:start position:0%
support this bill is
 
04:29:29.990 --> 04:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
because churches need to in times of
 
04:29:32.870 --> 04:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
Crisis provide many essential
 
04:29:35.229 --> 04:29:35.239 align:start position:0%
Services uh the New Hampshire food bank
 
04:29:38.269 --> 04:29:38.279 align:start position:0%
is oper ated by Capital uh Catholic
 
04:29:41.750 --> 04:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
Charities imagine if Catholic Charities
 
04:29:44.550 --> 04:29:44.560 align:start position:0%
had not been able to operate that
 
04:29:46.990 --> 04:29:47.000 align:start position:0%
essential service I think the New
 
04:29:49.389 --> 04:29:49.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire food bank is an essential
 
04:29:51.910 --> 04:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
service the same with the Salvation Army
 
04:29:55.389 --> 04:29:55.399 align:start position:0%
they have a very large facility in
 
04:29:58.349 --> 04:29:58.359 align:start position:0%
lonia so there seems to be a
 
04:30:01.510 --> 04:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding in the secular
 
04:30:04.710 --> 04:30:04.720 align:start position:0%
population that churches do not provide
 
04:30:06.429 --> 04:30:06.439 align:start position:0%
essential services there seems to be
 
04:30:09.070 --> 04:30:09.080 align:start position:0%
this Focus that going to church on
 
04:30:12.630 --> 04:30:12.640 align:start position:0%
Sunday and going through uh whatever
 
04:30:15.349 --> 04:30:15.359 align:start position:0%
denomination you are or your synagogue
 
04:30:19.830 --> 04:30:19.840 align:start position:0%
or your mosque that those entities only
 
04:30:23.950 --> 04:30:23.960 align:start position:0%
provide direct um religious Services
 
04:30:26.710 --> 04:30:26.720 align:start position:0%
when that could be the furthest from
 
04:30:28.990 --> 04:30:29.000 align:start position:0%
reality unfortunately due to the
 
04:30:32.189 --> 04:30:32.199 align:start position:0%
governor's order many smaller churches
 
04:30:34.349 --> 04:30:34.359 align:start position:0%
including the one that we attend in
 
04:30:36.710 --> 04:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
Molen Boro the United Methodist church
 
04:30:39.469 --> 04:30:39.479 align:start position:0%
we were forced down forced to close our
 
04:30:42.910 --> 04:30:42.920 align:start position:0%
doors and we could not provide essential
 
04:30:45.189 --> 04:30:45.199 align:start position:0%
Community Services many of which that
 
04:30:47.990 --> 04:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
are provided to
 
04:30:50.750 --> 04:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
non-members so that's the reason I'm
 
04:30:53.349 --> 04:30:53.359 align:start position:0%
supporting the bill I seriously you know
 
04:30:56.070 --> 04:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
in all practicality I don't think it's
 
04:30:59.429 --> 04:30:59.439 align:start position:0%
going to make it past the governor uh
 
04:31:03.750 --> 04:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
but I do think it warrants a discussion
 
04:31:07.429 --> 04:31:07.439 align:start position:0%
and um more like a a teaching lesson for
 
04:31:11.030 --> 04:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
people who do not really understand how
 
04:31:13.389 --> 04:31:13.399 align:start position:0%
churches essentially serve their
 
04:31:16.630 --> 04:31:16.640 align:start position:0%
communities Beyond uh showing up on
 
04:31:18.910 --> 04:31:18.920 align:start position:0%

looking but I don't see his name on the
 
04:31:49.389 --> 04:31:49.399 align:start position:0%

wish to speak uh one of them one of whom
 
04:32:04.469 --> 04:32:04.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:04.479 --> 04:32:08.070 align:start position:0%
 
huitt

04:32:08.070 --> 04:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:09.630 --> 04:32:09.640 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman can you hear
 
04:32:11.870 --> 04:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
me we can
 
04:32:14.870 --> 04:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
fantastic well I hope I can help provide
 
04:32:17.269 --> 04:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
some clarity here there's been a lot of
 
04:32:20.630 --> 04:32:20.640 align:start position:0%
discussion of religious liberty um and
 
04:32:23.910 --> 04:32:23.920 align:start position:0%
of the Mac decision and I I do believe
 
04:32:26.269 --> 04:32:26.279 align:start position:0%
that the Mac decision provides the
 
04:32:28.590 --> 04:32:28.600 align:start position:0%
protections that are in the Bill as
 
04:32:31.670 --> 04:32:31.680 align:start position:0%
amended and so for that reason um I
 
04:32:34.269 --> 04:32:34.279 align:start position:0%
think that this discussing excuse me not
 
04:32:35.670 --> 04:32:35.680 align:start position:0%
the bill as amended but the bill as
 
04:32:37.429 --> 04:32:37.439 align:start position:0%
originally written and so for that
 
04:32:38.990 --> 04:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
reason I think probably discussing the
 
04:32:41.269 --> 04:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
bill as originally written might not be
 
04:32:44.550 --> 04:32:44.560 align:start position:0%
the best overall use of our time um you
 
04:32:46.510 --> 04:32:46.520 align:start position:0%
know I I certainly am passionate about
 
04:32:48.630 --> 04:32:48.640 align:start position:0%
and focus on religious liberty and so if
 
04:32:49.950 --> 04:32:49.960 align:start position:0%
there are questions about whether
 
04:32:51.790 --> 04:32:51.800 align:start position:0%
religious liberty is a workable right
 
04:32:54.389 --> 04:32:54.399 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to discuss those but the Mac
 
04:32:56.870 --> 04:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
decision does already provide um those
 
04:32:58.790 --> 04:32:58.800 align:start position:0%
exact protections for religious liberty
 
04:33:00.349 --> 04:33:00.359 align:start position:0%
so if there are questions about the bill
 
04:33:02.189 --> 04:33:02.199 align:start position:0%
as introduced then then those same
 
04:33:04.349 --> 04:33:04.359 align:start position:0%
questions would apply to the macis
 
04:33:07.510 --> 04:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
itself the the amendment as I understand
 
04:33:10.189 --> 04:33:10.199 align:start position:0%
it would wholesale replace the text of
 
04:33:12.390 --> 04:33:12.400 align:start position:0%
the original bill and I think if any
 
04:33:14.949 --> 04:33:14.959 align:start position:0%
representative ever has a good excuse
 
04:33:16.910 --> 04:33:16.920 align:start position:0%
and reason to do that representative
 
04:33:19.830 --> 04:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
kofalt does as the Supreme Court after
 
04:33:22.109 --> 04:33:22.119 align:start position:0%
he had introduced the bill issued a
 
04:33:24.029 --> 04:33:24.039 align:start position:0%
decision providing the protections that
 
04:33:26.510 --> 04:33:26.520 align:start position:0%
were in the bill as introduced so I
 
04:33:28.510 --> 04:33:28.520 align:start position:0%
think he has a good reason to use this
 
04:33:31.429 --> 04:33:31.439 align:start position:0%
bill to address a a related but larger
 
04:33:33.869 --> 04:33:33.879 align:start position:0%
problem the the problem that's addressed
 
04:33:36.310 --> 04:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
by this amendment is not not religious
 
04:33:38.709 --> 04:33:38.719 align:start position:0%
liberty or or Gatherings or another
 
04:33:41.590 --> 04:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
partisan issue the problem is that our
 
04:33:44.551 --> 04:33:44.561 align:start position:0%
Superior Court cases are pretty clear in
 
04:33:46.429 --> 04:33:46.439 align:start position:0%
saying that during a state of emergency
 
04:33:48.109 --> 04:33:48.119 align:start position:0%
if someone brings any kind of
 
04:33:50.510 --> 04:33:50.520 align:start position:0%
constitutional Challenge and that may
 
04:33:52.189 --> 04:33:52.199 align:start position:0%
not be religious liberty that may not be
 
04:33:54.150 --> 04:33:54.160 align:start position:0%
about Gatherings it could be about
 
04:33:57.869 --> 04:33:57.879 align:start position:0%
speech the courts will simply not do a
 
04:34:00.510 --> 04:34:00.520 align:start position:0%
constitutional analysis I think if
 
04:34:02.670 --> 04:34:02.680 align:start position:0%
members of this committee read through
 
04:34:04.590 --> 04:34:04.600 align:start position:0%
some of the reasoning in the superior
 
04:34:07.150 --> 04:34:07.160 align:start position:0%
Court's been decision I think some
 
04:34:09.230 --> 04:34:09.240 align:start position:0%
members on both sides will be quite
 
04:34:11.551 --> 04:34:11.561 align:start position:0%
alarmed the court there was quite
 
04:34:13.670 --> 04:34:13.680 align:start position:0%
explicit in saying that under our
 
04:34:16.670 --> 04:34:16.680 align:start position:0%
current emergency Powers constitutional
 
04:34:19.429 --> 04:34:19.439 align:start position:0%
analysis simply doesn't apply under con
 
04:34:21.429 --> 04:34:21.439 align:start position:0%
any constitutional challenge du an
 
04:34:23.990 --> 04:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
emergency order the court will simply
 
04:34:26.189 --> 04:34:26.199 align:start position:0%
ask whether there's a factual some
 
04:34:27.990 --> 04:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
factual basis connecting the order to
 
04:34:30.470 --> 04:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
the state of emergency and if it was in
 
04:34:33.629 --> 04:34:33.639 align:start position:0%
good faith uh that allows virtually any
 
04:34:35.709 --> 04:34:35.719 align:start position:0%
right uh to be infringed and and the
 
04:34:39.349 --> 04:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
court was very explicit about this now I
 
04:34:41.029 --> 04:34:41.039 align:start position:0%
disagree in part with something
 
04:34:43.269 --> 04:34:43.279 align:start position:0%
representative Sylvia said I don't agree
 
04:34:45.230 --> 04:34:45.240 align:start position:0%
that if we change our emergency Powers
 
04:34:47.470 --> 04:34:47.480 align:start position:0%
law so that constitutional rights can't
 
04:34:49.629 --> 04:34:49.639 align:start position:0%
be suspended that will mean the governor
 
04:34:51.830 --> 04:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
can never prohibit Gatherings New
 
04:34:54.349 --> 04:34:54.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is in the minority in that our
 
04:34:56.269 --> 04:34:56.279 align:start position:0%
courts have said constitutional rights
 
04:34:58.709 --> 04:34:58.719 align:start position:0%
can be suspended what many other courts
 
04:35:01.551 --> 04:35:01.561 align:start position:0%
are doing in Maine for example is saying
 
04:35:03.551 --> 04:35:03.561 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights can't be suspended
 
04:35:05.590 --> 04:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
in a time of emergency but these
 
04:35:07.910 --> 04:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
emergency orders pass constitutional
 
04:35:09.709 --> 04:35:09.719 align:start position:0%
muster emergency orders limiting
 
04:35:11.670 --> 04:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
Gatherings and things so we would not
 
04:35:13.869 --> 04:35:13.879 align:start position:0%
have chaos in our state if we affected
 
04:35:15.310 --> 04:35:15.320 align:start position:0%
this change we would be in the same
 
04:35:17.910 --> 04:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
position as Maine which has a somewhat
 
04:35:20.869 --> 04:35:20.879 align:start position:0%
lower case count than us by the way and
 
04:35:22.429 --> 04:35:22.439 align:start position:0%
if I could I'll just walk through a
 
04:35:25.551 --> 04:35:25.561 align:start position:0%
specific hypothetical of how what I
 
04:35:27.470 --> 04:35:27.480 align:start position:0%
would characterize is an abusive case
 
04:35:29.390 --> 04:35:29.400 align:start position:0%
could easily play out um under our
 
04:35:32.789 --> 04:35:32.799 align:start position:0%
current law so suppose five or 10 years
 
04:35:34.590 --> 04:35:34.600 align:start position:0%
from now there were a legitimate
 
04:35:34.600 --> 04:35:35.750 align:start position:0%
from now there were a legitimate
emergency

04:35:35.750 --> 04:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
04:35:37.349 --> 04:35:37.359 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and let's say that the
 
04:35:39.551 --> 04:35:39.561 align:start position:0%
governor decided on the basis of a good
 
04:35:42.629 --> 04:35:42.639 align:start position:0%
faith belief that media coverage of that
 
04:35:45.429 --> 04:35:45.439 align:start position:0%
emergency was causing alarm um in the
 
04:35:47.429 --> 04:35:47.439 align:start position:0%
state so the governor issued an order
 
04:35:49.949 --> 04:35:49.959 align:start position:0%
under his emergency Powers saying that
 
04:35:52.029 --> 04:35:52.039 align:start position:0%
media in New Hampshire simply may not
 
04:35:54.910 --> 04:35:54.920 align:start position:0%
cover or report on the emergency and
 
04:35:56.470 --> 04:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
let's say the union leader or someone
 
04:35:58.150 --> 04:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
sought an injunction under the First
 
04:36:00.551 --> 04:36:00.561 align:start position:0%
Amendment challenge that the analysis
 
04:36:02.390 --> 04:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
that our Superior Courts have used in
 
04:36:04.269 --> 04:36:04.279 align:start position:0%
for example the bford case is just
 
04:36:07.070 --> 04:36:07.080 align:start position:0%
twofold is there a factual basis
 
04:36:08.670 --> 04:36:08.680 align:start position:0%
connecting the order to the state of
 
04:36:11.750 --> 04:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
emergency and was it in good faith so in
 
04:36:13.510 --> 04:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
my hypothetical where if the union
 
04:36:15.670 --> 04:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
leader seeks that injunction there is a
 
04:36:17.949 --> 04:36:17.959 align:start position:0%
factual basis no doubt about that um
 
04:36:20.029 --> 04:36:20.039 align:start position:0%
it's connected to the state of emergency
 
04:36:21.830 --> 04:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
and we've stipulated the governor in
 
04:36:23.990 --> 04:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
good faith believes media coverage is
 
04:36:27.150 --> 04:36:27.160 align:start position:0%
causing um harm and panic so the court
 
04:36:29.590 --> 04:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
would simply as a matter of course um
 
04:36:32.070 --> 04:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
then dismiss that suit it would apply
 
04:36:35.390 --> 04:36:35.400 align:start position:0%
apply no First Amendment analysis now
 
04:36:37.830 --> 04:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
under ordinary constitutional analysis
 
04:36:39.150 --> 04:36:39.160 align:start position:0%
what the court would do there is would
 
04:36:40.551 --> 04:36:40.561 align:start position:0%
it would say this is a Content
 
04:36:43.070 --> 04:36:43.080 align:start position:0%
discriminatory order so we're going to
 
04:36:45.470 --> 04:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
apply strict scrutiny but under the
 
04:36:47.590 --> 04:36:47.600 align:start position:0%
suspension of civil liberties Theory
 
04:36:49.390 --> 04:36:49.400 align:start position:0%
that's that's current in our Superior
 
04:36:51.429 --> 04:36:51.439 align:start position:0%
Courts that analysis simply wouldn't
 
04:36:53.590 --> 04:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
happen so the governor can do these
 
04:36:54.990 --> 04:36:55.000 align:start position:0%
other things the governor can try to
 
04:36:56.709 --> 04:36:56.719 align:start position:0%
limit Gatherings the governor could do
 
04:36:58.029 --> 04:36:58.039 align:start position:0%
everything the governor in Maine is
 
04:37:00.551 --> 04:37:00.561 align:start position:0%
doing right now the the concern is
 
04:37:02.470 --> 04:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
potential future situations where the
 
04:37:04.429 --> 04:37:04.439 align:start position:0%
governor would have effectively
 
04:37:07.510 --> 04:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
Unlimited power um I recognize some of
 
04:37:09.750 --> 04:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
these specific issues uh you know
 
04:37:11.750 --> 04:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
religious Liberties Gatherings maybe
 
04:37:13.269 --> 04:37:13.279 align:start position:0%
Second Amendment issues are more
 
04:37:16.109 --> 04:37:16.119 align:start position:0%
partisan but I think if there is one
 
04:37:17.789 --> 04:37:17.799 align:start position:0%
civil liberties issue where there could
 
04:37:20.551 --> 04:37:20.561 align:start position:0%
be some bipartisan support it should be
 
04:37:22.349 --> 04:37:22.359 align:start position:0%
on this question of whether civil
 
04:37:25.189 --> 04:37:25.199 align:start position:0%
liberties in their entirety May simply
 
04:37:27.670 --> 04:37:27.680 align:start position:0%
be declared suspended and whether courts
 
04:37:29.910 --> 04:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
can say we simply aren't going to do an
 
04:37:32.109 --> 04:37:32.119 align:start position:0%
analysis of these Liberties in a state
 
04:37:33.910 --> 04:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
of emergency and and the last thing I'll
 
04:37:36.429 --> 04:37:36.439 align:start position:0%
say and I'll take any questions is in
 
04:37:38.230 --> 04:37:38.240 align:start position:0%
response to something chairman Gordon
 
04:37:40.830 --> 04:37:40.840 align:start position:0%
said um you know just putting aside the
 
04:37:43.150 --> 04:37:43.160 align:start position:0%
original language what this bill as
 
04:37:45.470 --> 04:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
amended would do is precisely amend our
 
04:37:48.869 --> 04:37:48.879 align:start position:0%
emergency power statutes um I I agree
 
04:37:50.789 --> 04:37:50.799 align:start position:0%
with you chairman Gordon the the
 
04:37:53.990 --> 04:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
Superior Courts have uh have said that
 
04:37:55.629 --> 04:37:55.639 align:start position:0%
they are reaching these conclusions
 
04:37:57.390 --> 04:37:57.400 align:start position:0%
under the current emergency power
 
04:38:01.230 --> 04:38:01.240 align:start position:0%
statute so we could amend 4 colon 45 and
 
04:38:04.670 --> 04:38:04.680 align:start position:0%
4on 47 to say the governor has these
 
04:38:06.750 --> 04:38:06.760 align:start position:0%
very flexible enumerated powers in a
 
04:38:09.629 --> 04:38:09.639 align:start position:0%
state of emergency provided that civil
 
04:38:11.869 --> 04:38:11.879 align:start position:0%
liberties may not be suspended and what
 
04:38:13.789 --> 04:38:13.799 align:start position:0%
that means is not that the governor
 
04:38:16.429 --> 04:38:16.439 align:start position:0%
can't limit Gatherings can't can't do
 
04:38:18.310 --> 04:38:18.320 align:start position:0%
all kinds of things that most governors
 
04:38:20.390 --> 04:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
in other states are doing it simply
 
04:38:23.269 --> 04:38:23.279 align:start position:0%
means that when um specific orders are
 
04:38:25.990 --> 04:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
challenged the courts will do the normal
 
04:38:28.470 --> 04:38:28.480 align:start position:0%
constitutional analysis um under those
 
04:38:30.629 --> 04:38:30.639 align:start position:0%
challenges instead of just saying you
 
04:38:32.789 --> 04:38:32.799 align:start position:0%
don't have these rights right now so
 
04:38:35.029 --> 04:38:35.039 align:start position:0%
that that's the goal of this bill as as
 
04:38:37.349 --> 04:38:37.359 align:start position:0%
amended um I hope it's it's possible to
 
04:38:39.429 --> 04:38:39.439 align:start position:0%
have at least some bipartisan support
 
04:38:42.470 --> 04:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
and I'll say lastly if if there is any
 
04:38:44.230 --> 04:38:44.240 align:start position:0%
member of this committee who suspects
 
04:38:46.510 --> 04:38:46.520 align:start position:0%
that the amendment really is a back door
 
04:38:48.990 --> 04:38:49.000 align:start position:0%
for some more partisan issue I hope
 
04:38:50.510 --> 04:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
you'll you'll question me about that we
 
04:38:53.269 --> 04:38:53.279 align:start position:0%
can start that discussion and that a
 
04:38:54.869 --> 04:38:54.879 align:start position:0%
chance to explain why that's not the
 
04:38:57.390 --> 04:38:57.400 align:start position:0%
case and I'm happy to take any questions
 
04:39:00.269 --> 04:39:00.279 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Oregan well
 
04:39:01.789 --> 04:39:01.799 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair thank you
 
04:39:05.429 --> 04:39:05.439 align:start position:0%
much attorney uh attorney H at
 
04:39:08.470 --> 04:39:08.480 align:start position:0%
guess I'll do a couple link together a
 
04:39:10.230 --> 04:39:10.240 align:start position:0%
couple of non-hypothetical cases that
 
04:39:12.230 --> 04:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
happened up here in Northern New England
 
04:39:14.310 --> 04:39:14.320 align:start position:0%
the first part of it was there was a
 
04:39:18.551 --> 04:39:18.561 align:start position:0%
religious gathering in U Central Maine
 
04:39:21.070 --> 04:39:21.080 align:start position:0%
guess it was a uh a wedding ceremony I
 
04:39:22.709 --> 04:39:22.719 align:start position:0%
believe which I guess is not necessarily
 
04:39:24.590 --> 04:39:24.600 align:start position:0%
a religious gathering but this one was
 
04:39:27.869 --> 04:39:27.879 align:start position:0%
and uh large number of people attended
 
04:39:27.879 --> 04:39:28.670 align:start position:0%
and uh large number of people attended
um

04:39:28.670 --> 04:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:31.949 --> 04:39:31.959 align:start position:0%
apparently without observing the uh
 
04:39:34.150 --> 04:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
various precautions that are taken more
 
04:39:35.590 --> 04:39:35.600 align:start position:0%
for granted now than they were this
 
04:39:39.070 --> 04:39:39.080 align:start position:0%
summer and which aren't and um so that
 
04:39:42.350 --> 04:39:42.360 align:start position:0%
those people who attended it caused um
 
04:39:44.310 --> 04:39:44.320 align:start position:0%
you know caused hundreds of other covid
 
04:39:46.110 --> 04:39:46.120 align:start position:0%
cases including a number of deaths you
 
04:39:47.510 --> 04:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
know quite far a field from the
 
04:39:48.948 --> 04:39:48.958 align:start position:0%
Gathering probably some even in New
 
04:39:51.628 --> 04:39:51.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I know for example caused an
 
04:39:54.310 --> 04:39:54.320 align:start position:0%
outbreak at um I think New York County
 
04:39:56.190 --> 04:39:56.200 align:start position:0%
Prison which is which is a county that
 
04:39:59.708 --> 04:39:59.718 align:start position:0%
ad joins my county and then subsequently
 
04:40:01.550 --> 04:40:01.560 align:start position:0%
so the second non-hypothetical case
 
04:40:05.270 --> 04:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
which is ISU the same issue as we had a
 
04:40:07.788 --> 04:40:07.798 align:start position:0%
a representative from dipit had a uh
 
04:40:10.110 --> 04:40:10.120 align:start position:0%
basically a Tent Revival on his property
 
04:40:13.788 --> 04:40:13.798 align:start position:0%
and sent uh then they sent people out
 
04:40:16.230 --> 04:40:16.240 align:start position:0%
to and then they sent attendees at the
 
04:40:18.070 --> 04:40:18.080 align:start position:0%
tent Gathering went out to other other
 
04:40:20.190 --> 04:40:20.200 align:start position:0%
homes in New Hampshire Massachusetts Pro
 
04:40:22.430 --> 04:40:22.440 align:start position:0%
ties and there was controversy over how
 
04:40:26.270 --> 04:40:26.280 align:start position:0%
to address that so um so do you are you
 
04:40:28.190 --> 04:40:28.200 align:start position:0%
are you so do you feel that um religious
 
04:40:30.390 --> 04:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
organizations should be held to a lower
 
04:40:32.510 --> 04:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
standard for those type of precautions
 
04:40:34.430 --> 04:40:34.440 align:start position:0%
than um non-religious organizations
 
04:40:38.190 --> 04:40:38.200 align:start position:0%
would who also are peacefully assembling
 
04:40:41.350 --> 04:40:41.360 align:start position:0%
for whatever purpose they're assembling
 
04:40:44.350 --> 04:40:44.360 align:start position:0%
for well there is a distinct right for
 
04:40:46.910 --> 04:40:46.920 align:start position:0%
religious gatherings um you know there
 
04:40:48.628 --> 04:40:48.638 align:start position:0%
there are rights General rights to
 
04:40:50.510 --> 04:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
assembly in our constitution but you
 
04:40:51.948 --> 04:40:51.958 align:start position:0%
know there are specific rights for the
 
04:40:53.750 --> 04:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
free exercise of religion whereas
 
04:40:56.110 --> 04:40:56.120 align:start position:0%
there's not specifically uh enumerated
 
04:40:57.788 --> 04:40:57.798 align:start position:0%
rights for like a labor organization
 
04:41:00.470 --> 04:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
organize so there is a special right
 
04:41:02.190 --> 04:41:02.200 align:start position:0%
that can be applied in those sorts of
 
04:41:03.910 --> 04:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
cases that you could bring a free a
 
04:41:05.990 --> 04:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
state free EXC challenge under now the
 
04:41:08.868 --> 04:41:08.878 align:start position:0%
Mac decision so that's already in place
 
04:41:10.948 --> 04:41:10.958 align:start position:0%
now I I think the question and issue
 
04:41:14.390 --> 04:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
here is if let's say I were to represent
 
04:41:16.310 --> 04:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
one of those religious groups and sue
 
04:41:17.670 --> 04:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
for an injunction under the free
 
04:41:21.150 --> 04:41:21.160 align:start position:0%
exercise clause would the courts um
 
04:41:23.110 --> 04:41:23.120 align:start position:0%
apply the ordinary free exercise
 
04:41:25.670 --> 04:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
analysis under the Mac decision and if
 
04:41:27.708 --> 04:41:27.718 align:start position:0%
they did that doesn't automatically mean
 
04:41:29.230 --> 04:41:29.240 align:start position:0%
they would allow the Gatherings the
 
04:41:31.910 --> 04:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
court would just ask is this narrowly
 
04:41:33.788 --> 04:41:33.798 align:start position:0%
tailored to achieve a compelling
 
04:41:34.990 --> 04:41:35.000 align:start position:0%
government purpose just just the
 
04:41:38.190 --> 04:41:38.200 align:start position:0%
ordinary constitutional analysis but
 
04:41:40.628 --> 04:41:40.638 align:start position:0%
under a suspension theory in a state of
 
04:41:43.430 --> 04:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
emergency the court would apply no
 
04:41:45.270 --> 04:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
constitutional analysis it would say
 
04:41:47.110 --> 04:41:47.120 align:start position:0%
this is an emergency this is a good
 
04:41:49.948 --> 04:41:49.958 align:start position:0%
faith action um this is connected to the
 
04:41:51.830 --> 04:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
state of emergency and I'm going to
 
04:41:54.830 --> 04:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
throw this case out um now I will tell
 
04:41:56.830 --> 04:41:56.840 align:start position:0%
you setting aside what I think should
 
04:41:59.510 --> 04:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
happen I think it it just is correct
 
04:42:02.470 --> 04:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
that if our courts were instructed under
 
04:42:03.990 --> 04:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
this amendment to do regular
 
04:42:06.910 --> 04:42:06.920 align:start position:0%
Constitution analysis I do think that in
 
04:42:08.470 --> 04:42:08.480 align:start position:0%
the situation you're describing our
 
04:42:10.270 --> 04:42:10.280 align:start position:0%
Superior Courts would find that the
 
04:42:12.470 --> 04:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
orders were constitutional I happen to
 
04:42:14.070 --> 04:42:14.080 align:start position:0%
think that the orders that were
 
04:42:16.070 --> 04:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
challenged in Binford itself actually
 
04:42:18.670 --> 04:42:18.680 align:start position:0%
were constitutional and I think if the
 
04:42:20.788 --> 04:42:20.798 align:start position:0%
court had just done an ordinary
 
04:42:22.230 --> 04:42:22.240 align:start position:0%
constitutional analysis it would have
 
04:42:24.310 --> 04:42:24.320 align:start position:0%
upheld those orders what's troubling is
 
04:42:26.150 --> 04:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
the precedent these courts have set by
 
04:42:28.590 --> 04:42:28.600 align:start position:0%
saying constitutional rights flat out
 
04:42:30.830 --> 04:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
don't apply and we just won't do
 
04:42:32.990 --> 04:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
analysis and and that applies not just
 
04:42:35.110 --> 04:42:35.120 align:start position:0%
to cases representative oron where you
 
04:42:37.350 --> 04:42:37.360 align:start position:0%
and I might disagree like religious
 
04:42:39.750 --> 04:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
gatherings but all other kinds of civil
 
04:42:41.628 --> 04:42:41.638 align:start position:0%
liberties cases for Fourth Amendment
 
04:42:44.430 --> 04:42:44.440 align:start position:0%
cases um in bford the the court
 
04:42:47.310 --> 04:42:47.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned it quoted an 11 circuit case
 
04:42:50.670 --> 04:42:50.680 align:start position:0%
um AO I believe and in that case and in
 
04:42:52.110 --> 04:42:52.120 align:start position:0%
the quotation from that case the court
 
04:42:53.788 --> 04:42:53.798 align:start position:0%
was quite explicit that the first
 
04:42:55.350 --> 04:42:55.360 align:start position:0%
amendment is among the rights that can
 
04:42:57.510 --> 04:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
be suspended including just you know
 
04:43:00.470 --> 04:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
ordinary speech rights um so the the
 
04:43:01.830 --> 04:43:01.840 align:start position:0%
idea that civil liberties can be
 
04:43:04.708 --> 04:43:04.718 align:start position:0%
suspended in an emergency undermines all
 
04:43:07.110 --> 04:43:07.120 align:start position:0%
of our enumerated civil liberties rights
 
04:43:09.270 --> 04:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
including some where I expect we would
 
04:43:11.390 --> 04:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
agree and not just these religious
 
04:43:11.400 --> 04:43:14.948 align:start position:0%
agree and not just these religious
gatherings

04:43:14.948 --> 04:43:14.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:18.708 --> 04:43:18.718 align:start position:0%
tyan are you okay oh well I'm fine but
 
04:43:22.628 --> 04:43:22.638 align:start position:0%
I've got a follow followup please um
 
04:43:24.470 --> 04:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
course this is also a political rather
 
04:43:24.480 --> 04:43:25.510 align:start position:0%
course this is also a political rather
than

04:43:25.510 --> 04:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
than
 
04:43:28.070 --> 04:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
constitutional um question and I
 
04:43:29.830 --> 04:43:29.840 align:start position:0%
probably a little bit outside this bill
 
04:43:32.070 --> 04:43:32.080 align:start position:0%
but do you think we need to recalibrate
 
04:43:34.030 --> 04:43:34.040 align:start position:0%
sort of the relationship between church
 
04:43:36.788 --> 04:43:36.798 align:start position:0%
and state like James Madison's name came
 
04:43:39.150 --> 04:43:39.160 align:start position:0%
up at the beginning and controversy in
 
04:43:42.310 --> 04:43:42.320 align:start position:0%
that case was uh you know churches were
 
04:43:44.590 --> 04:43:44.600 align:start position:0%
directly subsidized by the state in fact
 
04:43:46.910 --> 04:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
they were part of the state and they
 
04:43:49.310 --> 04:43:49.320 align:start position:0%
provided they Alli them for a lot more
 
04:43:51.070 --> 04:43:51.080 align:start position:0%
range of services than they are now and
 
04:43:53.868 --> 04:43:53.878 align:start position:0%
then um Susan price who came by by way
 
04:43:56.190 --> 04:43:56.200 align:start position:0%
is a former State Rep from barington who
 
04:43:58.788 --> 04:43:58.798 align:start position:0%
since moved to Bolton bro but um she
 
04:44:00.310 --> 04:44:00.320 align:start position:0%
pointed out that her church in in
 
04:44:03.230 --> 04:44:03.240 align:start position:0%
molteno U you know provides a lot of uh
 
04:44:05.270 --> 04:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
services and then gets for example prop
 
04:44:06.990 --> 04:44:07.000 align:start position:0%
and then she didn't mention get property
 
04:44:09.030 --> 04:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
tax exemptions a variety of other
 
04:44:10.788 --> 04:44:10.798 align:start position:0%
subsidies from the state you think
 
04:44:13.230 --> 04:44:13.240 align:start position:0%
perhaps would be good idea moving
 
04:44:16.390 --> 04:44:16.400 align:start position:0%
forward to deal with perhaps to uh
 
04:44:19.868 --> 04:44:19.878 align:start position:0%
reduce the subsidies and um and perhaps
 
04:44:21.750 --> 04:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
increase the secular sector I guess is
 
04:44:23.030 --> 04:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
probably you're horrified by that
 
04:44:25.788 --> 04:44:25.798 align:start position:0%
suggestion but I I'll bring it up anyway
 
04:44:27.470 --> 04:44:27.480 align:start position:0%
I don't know that I'm horrified in it I
 
04:44:29.150 --> 04:44:29.160 align:start position:0%
guess I would just say I'm much less
 
04:44:31.070 --> 04:44:31.080 align:start position:0%
interested in these Establishment Clause
 
04:44:33.190 --> 04:44:33.200 align:start position:0%
questions than free exercise the
 
04:44:34.310 --> 04:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
questions that I work on with
 
04:44:36.470 --> 04:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
Cornerstone in the Constitutional area
 
04:44:38.788 --> 04:44:38.798 align:start position:0%
tend to be free exercise question and I
 
04:44:40.670 --> 04:44:40.680 align:start position:0%
I think that was the origin of that
 
04:44:43.708 --> 04:44:43.718 align:start position:0%
Madison quotation in the original bill
 
04:44:47.070 --> 04:44:47.080 align:start position:0%
is is yes is just that Madison was
 
04:44:49.510 --> 04:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
saying that the the free exercise right
 
04:44:51.230 --> 04:44:51.240 align:start position:0%
which Madison drafted by the way should
 
04:44:53.708 --> 04:44:53.718 align:start position:0%
be enforcable like any other right but
 
04:44:55.948 --> 04:44:55.958 align:start position:0%
but of course all of that language
 
04:44:57.750 --> 04:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
specific to religious liberty will be a
 
04:45:00.948 --> 04:45:00.958 align:start position:0%
moved by by the amendment um and the the
 
04:45:02.750 --> 04:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
amendment will simply broadly address
 
04:45:05.270 --> 04:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
civil liberties okay
 
04:45:08.270 --> 04:45:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:11.230 --> 04:45:11.240 align:start position:0%
Kelly thank you Mr chairman um thank you
 
04:45:12.750 --> 04:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um can you tell
 
04:45:14.270 --> 04:45:14.280 align:start position:0%
me was the bford case taken to the
 
04:45:17.510 --> 04:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court no it it wasn't taken to
 
04:45:20.070 --> 04:45:20.080 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court um I would say that
 
04:45:22.030 --> 04:45:22.040 align:start position:0%
there are a few reasons that the house
 
04:45:24.350 --> 04:45:24.360 align:start position:0%
should go ahead and address this issue
 
04:45:26.390 --> 04:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
um even though it hasn't yet been taken
 
04:45:28.628 --> 04:45:28.638 align:start position:0%
into um you know one is that this has
 
04:45:30.350 --> 04:45:30.360 align:start position:0%
been a very influential case we've seen
 
04:45:33.070 --> 04:45:33.080 align:start position:0%
it cited in other Superior Court cases
 
04:45:35.030 --> 04:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
by an influential and respective judge
 
04:45:37.190 --> 04:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
who's clearly particularly influential
 
04:45:39.628 --> 04:45:39.638 align:start position:0%
um in the area of of constitutional
 
04:45:41.110 --> 04:45:41.120 align:start position:0%
rights and how they apply to states of
 
04:45:43.750 --> 04:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
emergency um Governor suu himself has
 
04:45:47.390 --> 04:45:47.400 align:start position:0%
repeatedly cited the bford case um in in
 
04:45:49.510 --> 04:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
his emergency orders and of course this
 
04:45:52.070 --> 04:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
this was argued um by our solicitor
 
04:45:54.350 --> 04:45:54.360 align:start position:0%
general the The Briefing calling
 
04:45:56.590 --> 04:45:56.600 align:start position:0%
explicitly for courts to hold that
 
04:45:58.230 --> 04:45:58.240 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights can be suspended
 
04:46:00.550 --> 04:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
in states of emergency was written by
 
04:46:02.750 --> 04:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
our solicitor general so there there are
 
04:46:04.350 --> 04:46:04.360 align:start position:0%
you know this is certainly a theory that
 
04:46:06.628 --> 04:46:06.638 align:start position:0%
has a lot of currency even though it
 
04:46:08.910 --> 04:46:08.920 align:start position:0%
hasn't been taken up to the Supreme
 
04:46:11.270 --> 04:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
Court yet um and I I think that it would
 
04:46:13.190 --> 04:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
be best to rather than waiting for this
 
04:46:16.430 --> 04:46:16.440 align:start position:0%
to get out of control and for a future
 
04:46:18.270 --> 04:46:18.280 align:start position:0%
um you know potentially quite intrusive
 
04:46:20.910 --> 04:46:20.920 align:start position:0%
situation to play out for the house to
 
04:46:23.990 --> 04:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
act to enact this reasonable limitation
 
04:46:25.708 --> 04:46:25.718 align:start position:0%
on the scope of the emergency power
 
04:46:27.670 --> 04:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
statutes that you know would not
 
04:46:29.390 --> 04:46:29.400 align:start position:0%
undermine most of what the governor is
 
04:46:31.150 --> 04:46:31.160 align:start position:0%
doing but would just bring us into line
 
04:46:33.230 --> 04:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
with other states like Maine where
 
04:46:35.390 --> 04:46:35.400 align:start position:0%
courts are still doing regular
 
04:46:39.070 --> 04:46:39.080 align:start position:0%
constitutional analysis in these
 
04:46:43.430 --> 04:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
cases thank you I guess that that begs
 
04:46:46.510 --> 04:46:46.520 align:start position:0%
my question really and that is as I
 
04:46:47.868 --> 04:46:47.878 align:start position:0%
understand the amendment again I don't
 
04:46:49.548 --> 04:46:49.558 align:start position:0%
have the amendment in front of me I'm
 
04:46:52.708 --> 04:46:52.718 align:start position:0%
sorry but as I heard the testimony the
 
04:46:55.750 --> 04:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
testimony is that the amendment has a
 
04:46:58.190 --> 04:46:58.200 align:start position:0%
couple of paragraphs but more
 
04:47:01.788 --> 04:47:01.798 align:start position:0%
specifically it indicates
 
04:47:05.310 --> 04:47:05.320 align:start position:0%
that constitutional civil
 
04:47:09.548 --> 04:47:09.558 align:start position:0%
rights uh will not be set aside or
 
04:47:12.030 --> 04:47:12.040 align:start position:0%
infringed by the exercise of the
 
04:47:14.548 --> 04:47:14.558 align:start position:0%
governor's emergency
 
04:47:18.910 --> 04:47:18.920 align:start position:0%
Powers which is different than the idea
 
04:47:22.590 --> 04:47:22.600 align:start position:0%
that if the governor does exercise his
 
04:47:24.190 --> 04:47:24.200 align:start position:0%
emergency powers that affect
 
04:47:28.230 --> 04:47:28.240 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights that the standard
 
04:47:30.708 --> 04:47:30.718 align:start position:0%
of review should be put in place that
 
04:47:32.310 --> 04:47:32.320 align:start position:0%
basically says he has to have a
 
04:47:34.110 --> 04:47:34.120 align:start position:0%
compelling the state has to prove that
 
04:47:36.910 --> 04:47:36.920 align:start position:0%
there's a compelling interest to do so
 
04:47:39.670 --> 04:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
and which seems to have a lot more
 
04:47:42.868 --> 04:47:42.878 align:start position:0%
appeal to me than the standard that
 
04:47:45.830 --> 04:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
might be in this amendment and I'm just
 
04:47:47.390 --> 04:47:47.400 align:start position:0%
wondering if that's something that
 
04:47:50.070 --> 04:47:50.080 align:start position:0%
possibly could be
 
04:47:52.868 --> 04:47:52.878 align:start position:0%
changed in time for us to act on this
 
04:47:55.670 --> 04:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
bill in a timely
 
04:47:58.628 --> 04:47:58.638 align:start position:0%
manner well Corone would certainly have
 
04:48:00.470 --> 04:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
no objection to the removal of the word
 
04:48:02.030 --> 04:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
infringement but I would point out
 
04:48:03.670 --> 04:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
obviously there are many rights in the
 
04:48:06.708 --> 04:48:06.718 align:start position:0%
con tion that use that word infringe and
 
04:48:08.470 --> 04:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
of course what what that means in
 
04:48:11.270 --> 04:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
practice is is not that if I bring a a
 
04:48:13.470 --> 04:48:13.480 align:start position:0%
First Amendment case the court you know
 
04:48:15.030 --> 04:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
automatically as soon as my speech is
 
04:48:16.910 --> 04:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
burdened it gives me an injunction what
 
04:48:18.110 --> 04:48:18.120 align:start position:0%
what it means is just that the court
 
04:48:20.150 --> 04:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
will do ordinary strict scrutiny
 
04:48:22.310 --> 04:48:22.320 align:start position:0%
analysis and and I also think chairman
 
04:48:24.070 --> 04:48:24.080 align:start position:0%
Gordon if you read through the the whole
 
04:48:25.548 --> 04:48:25.558 align:start position:0%
Amendment there's there's a lot of
 
04:48:28.350 --> 04:48:28.360 align:start position:0%
language about its purpose and I I think
 
04:48:30.070 --> 04:48:30.080 align:start position:0%
you'll you'll probably agree that the
 
04:48:32.070 --> 04:48:32.080 align:start position:0%
the purpose of it is just to ensure that
 
04:48:34.948 --> 04:48:34.958 align:start position:0%
ordinary constitutional analysis
 
04:48:38.390 --> 04:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
is applied and and not to C certainly
 
04:48:40.830 --> 04:48:40.840 align:start position:0%
not to enact any higher standard in
 
04:48:43.110 --> 04:48:43.120 align:start position:0%
times of emergency all of the purpose
 
04:48:46.070 --> 04:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
oriented language is about fact that the
 
04:48:47.830 --> 04:48:47.840 align:start position:0%
general court in the in this Bill is
 
04:48:49.750 --> 04:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
saying it once regular constitutional
 
04:48:51.910 --> 04:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
scrutiny to be applied but you know at
 
04:48:54.510 --> 04:48:54.520 align:start position:0%
the same time if if that's a concern
 
04:48:56.150 --> 04:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
from my perspective taking out the word
 
04:48:57.708 --> 04:48:57.718 align:start position:0%
infringe wouldn't undermine the
 
04:48:59.510 --> 04:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
amendment so if if that's something that
 
04:49:01.670 --> 04:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
would make others more comfortable um
 
04:49:03.430 --> 04:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
with the bill that's not something that
 
04:49:06.628 --> 04:49:06.638 align:start position:0%
that certain Cornerstone would
 
04:49:08.510 --> 04:49:08.520 align:start position:0%
object thank
 
04:49:11.230 --> 04:49:11.240 align:start position:0%
you there any other questions for Mr
 
04:49:13.350 --> 04:49:13.360 align:start position:0%
hwood seeing none thank you for your
 
04:49:15.708 --> 04:49:15.718 align:start position:0%
testimony today thank
 
04:49:22.990 --> 04:49:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:26.510 --> 04:49:26.520 align:start position:0%
Hy good afternoon committee um chairman
 
04:49:28.670 --> 04:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
Gordon um good to see you um
 
04:49:30.310 --> 04:49:30.320 align:start position:0%
representative Smith and who else did I
 
04:49:31.868 --> 04:49:31.878 align:start position:0%
see I saw representative buron there at
 
04:49:33.910 --> 04:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
one point with a really cool background
 
04:49:36.310 --> 04:49:36.320 align:start position:0%
for the record um former representative
 
04:49:39.070 --> 04:49:39.080 align:start position:0%
J.R Hull um currently the secretary for
 
04:49:40.708 --> 04:49:40.718 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Firearms Coalition as
 
04:49:43.670 --> 04:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
well I speak um both as a citizen as
 
04:49:46.708 --> 04:49:46.718 align:start position:0%
well as um a board member for the New
 
04:49:50.070 --> 04:49:50.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Firearms Coalition and I want
 
04:49:52.230 --> 04:49:52.240 align:start position:0%
to talk about both the bill as filed as
 
04:49:53.788 --> 04:49:53.798 align:start position:0%
well as the amendment so I'm going to do
 
04:49:55.708 --> 04:49:55.718 align:start position:0%
the bill as
 
04:49:55.718 --> 04:49:57.270 align:start position:0%
the bill as
filed

04:49:57.270 --> 04:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
filed
 
04:50:00.230 --> 04:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
we we think there is value to the bill
 
04:50:02.868 --> 04:50:02.878 align:start position:0%
as filed I appreciate the case law for
 
04:50:05.270 --> 04:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
those who are attorneys on on the on in
 
04:50:07.750 --> 04:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
this meeting you guys love case law
 
04:50:09.830 --> 04:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
that's great I love statutes but that's
 
04:50:11.230 --> 04:50:11.240 align:start position:0%
probably due to the fact that I spent
 
04:50:13.310 --> 04:50:13.320 align:start position:0%
eight years helping write them and I
 
04:50:15.150 --> 04:50:15.160 align:start position:0%
think citizens go to statutes first then
 
04:50:17.750 --> 04:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
they do case law so if if there was
 
04:50:19.708 --> 04:50:19.718 align:start position:0%
still value in having this even though
 
04:50:22.548 --> 04:50:22.558 align:start position:0%
the Mac decision is is good having case
 
04:50:25.190 --> 04:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
law in my opinion is is even more
 
04:50:28.670 --> 04:50:28.680 align:start position:0%
valuable um regarding the so I'm speak
 
04:50:31.030 --> 04:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
that's for me speaking as as for myself
 
04:50:33.110 --> 04:50:33.120 align:start position:0%
regarding the amendment I think the
 
04:50:34.708 --> 04:50:34.718 align:start position:0%
amendment is really really clear in
 
04:50:38.590 --> 04:50:38.600 align:start position:0%
terms of the changes to RSA 445 and 47
 
04:50:41.270 --> 04:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
in sections 6 and S of the
 
04:50:43.590 --> 04:50:43.600 align:start position:0%
amendment that the protections outlined
 
04:50:46.110 --> 04:50:46.120 align:start position:0%
in the Constitution and be that the
 
04:50:48.270 --> 04:50:48.280 align:start position:0%
Second Amendment article
 
04:50:52.470 --> 04:50:52.480 align:start position:0%
2A right be that our our Free Speech
 
04:50:55.548 --> 04:50:55.558 align:start position:0%
protections should never be um stepped
 
04:50:57.788 --> 04:50:57.798 align:start position:0%
on even in an
 
04:51:00.390 --> 04:51:00.400 align:start position:0%
emergency when our Founders drafted the
 
04:51:02.270 --> 04:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
Constitution they thought about things
 
04:51:04.990 --> 04:51:05.000 align:start position:0%
like this and it was only the 1980s that
 
04:51:06.590 --> 04:51:06.600 align:start position:0%
we bothered to strip some of this
 
04:51:11.628 --> 04:51:11.638 align:start position:0%
language out um article 43 in in part 2
 
04:51:13.910 --> 04:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
actually removed the the language
 
04:51:16.350 --> 04:51:16.360 align:start position:0%
infectious deer um from what the
 
04:51:18.510 --> 04:51:18.520 align:start position:0%
government the governor had authority to
 
04:51:20.670 --> 04:51:20.680 align:start position:0%
do in
 
04:51:23.310 --> 04:51:23.320 align:start position:0%
1980 so it was clear that the founders
 
04:51:25.910 --> 04:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
realized that infectious diseases are in
 
04:51:27.990 --> 04:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
fact a real issue they need to be dealt
 
04:51:30.070 --> 04:51:30.080 align:start position:0%
with appropriately and the governor
 
04:51:31.750 --> 04:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
should be the first one to call the the
 
04:51:34.548 --> 04:51:34.558 align:start position:0%
legislature back in to session for the
 
04:51:37.830 --> 04:51:37.840 align:start position:0%
purpose of having policy decided and and
 
04:51:40.110 --> 04:51:40.120 align:start position:0%
that's an appropriate separation of
 
04:51:43.430 --> 04:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
powers um if I go to part first there's
 
04:51:46.110 --> 04:51:46.120 align:start position:0%
there's numerous sections where the
 
04:51:47.990 --> 04:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
suspension of laws should only be by the
 
04:51:51.910 --> 04:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
legislature and not by anyone else
 
04:51:55.750 --> 04:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
um but that's where we are so the
 
04:51:57.350 --> 04:51:57.360 align:start position:0%
question was raised is this that over
 
04:52:00.190 --> 04:52:00.200 align:start position:0%
the toop change no I think this is an
 
04:52:04.070 --> 04:52:04.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate level change to um the eer
 
04:52:06.270 --> 04:52:06.280 align:start position:0%
Powers know that the governor can always
 
04:52:07.868 --> 04:52:07.878 align:start position:0%
call the legislature back in the session
 
04:52:11.190 --> 04:52:11.200 align:start position:0%
and say hey guys we have a problem um
 
04:52:12.948 --> 04:52:12.958 align:start position:0%
and I could think of problems that
 
04:52:15.430 --> 04:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
exceed the covid restrictions let's just
 
04:52:19.470 --> 04:52:19.480 align:start position:0%
say um seabook heaven forbid but C Brook
 
04:52:22.788 --> 04:52:22.798 align:start position:0%
had a an Emergency shutdown problem and
 
04:52:25.070 --> 04:52:25.080 align:start position:0%
there was a slow leak whether it was a
 
04:52:26.708 --> 04:52:26.718 align:start position:0%
leak in the primary Loop or a leak in
 
04:52:28.788 --> 04:52:28.798 align:start position:0%
the secondary that's a real emergency
 
04:52:31.788 --> 04:52:31.798 align:start position:0%
and I think everybody on this um that's
 
04:52:33.390 --> 04:52:33.400 align:start position:0%
participating in this hearing would
 
04:52:35.350 --> 04:52:35.360 align:start position:0%
understand that that's a real emergency
 
04:52:36.750 --> 04:52:36.760 align:start position:0%
and the right thing to do would be to
 
04:52:38.510 --> 04:52:38.520 align:start position:0%
call the legislature back in session
 
04:52:39.868 --> 04:52:39.878 align:start position:0%
because we may have to move everybody
 
04:52:41.430 --> 04:52:41.440 align:start position:0%
who's over in that section of the state
 
04:52:44.910 --> 04:52:44.920 align:start position:0%
away or who knows what
 
04:52:47.430 --> 04:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
um so it is important that the the
 
04:52:50.350 --> 04:52:50.360 align:start position:0%
governor call on the legislature but at
 
04:52:52.868 --> 04:52:52.878 align:start position:0%
no point should we ever allow the
 
04:52:55.150 --> 04:52:55.160 align:start position:0%
Executive Branch the ability to suspend
 
04:52:57.430 --> 04:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
our constitutional protections I'm going
 
04:53:00.230 --> 04:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
to I'm going to use the example um that
 
04:53:02.470 --> 04:53:02.480 align:start position:0%
attorney huitt hwit just said right
 
04:53:04.868 --> 04:53:04.878 align:start position:0%
about what if the press was was stirring
 
04:53:06.670 --> 04:53:06.680 align:start position:0%
up a controversy and the governor just
 
04:53:08.510 --> 04:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
said arbitrarily well we're going to
 
04:53:11.190 --> 04:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
prevent them from from participating at
 
04:53:14.030 --> 04:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
that event my God I can't think of a
 
04:53:15.430 --> 04:53:15.440 align:start position:0%
worse offense than shutting down the
 
04:53:19.708 --> 04:53:19.718 align:start position:0%
Free Press if if the Press cannot um
 
04:53:21.628 --> 04:53:21.638 align:start position:0%
report on what's going on you're going
 
04:53:23.948 --> 04:53:23.958 align:start position:0%
to get a very biased story from somebody
 
04:53:25.990 --> 04:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
and it's not going to be the free and
 
04:53:26.000 --> 04:53:27.150 align:start position:0%
and it's not going to be the free and
fair

04:53:27.150 --> 04:53:27.160 align:start position:0%
fair
 
04:53:27.160 --> 04:53:29.548 align:start position:0%
fair
press

04:53:29.548 --> 04:53:29.558 align:start position:0%
press
 
04:53:33.230 --> 04:53:33.240 align:start position:0%
so this small change is adequate it's
 
04:53:36.110 --> 04:53:36.120 align:start position:0%
clear here it it puts and I've seen the
 
04:53:39.190 --> 04:53:39.200 align:start position:0%
amendment um it puts reasonable
 
04:53:43.110 --> 04:53:43.120 align:start position:0%
constraints on the the emergency powers
 
04:53:44.990 --> 04:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
that they are in statute it doesn't
 
04:53:46.990 --> 04:53:47.000 align:start position:0%
completely repeal them it doesn't
 
04:53:48.830 --> 04:53:48.840 align:start position:0%
over-the-top wholesale them and change
 
04:53:50.830 --> 04:53:50.840 align:start position:0%
them dramatically but it does put in
 
04:53:54.788 --> 04:53:54.798 align:start position:0%
reasonable protections to note that the
 
04:53:56.190 --> 04:53:56.200 align:start position:0%
rights that are outlined in the
 
04:53:58.750 --> 04:53:58.760 align:start position:0%
Constitution the doubt the quote Thou
 
04:54:01.470 --> 04:54:01.480 align:start position:0%
shalt not overstep these bounds unquote
 
04:54:03.190 --> 04:54:03.200 align:start position:0%
language which is pretty clear in the
 
04:54:06.670 --> 04:54:06.680 align:start position:0%
Bill of rights is off limits during
 
04:54:08.910 --> 04:54:08.920 align:start position:0%
these emergency shutdowns or emergency
 
04:54:10.948 --> 04:54:10.958 align:start position:0%
orders so I would ask that you would
 
04:54:13.990 --> 04:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
have passed both the bill as filed in my
 
04:54:15.788 --> 04:54:15.798 align:start position:0%
opinion they should be merged but that's
 
04:54:18.628 --> 04:54:18.638 align:start position:0%
me as a novice um and there may be
 
04:54:20.470 --> 04:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
others who have different opinion but at
 
04:54:24.030 --> 04:54:24.040 align:start position:0%
least sections six and seven should be
 
04:54:27.948 --> 04:54:27.958 align:start position:0%
added to the original bill because um
 
04:54:29.670 --> 04:54:29.680 align:start position:0%
our constitutional protections are kind
 
04:54:33.510 --> 04:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
of the Baseline the foundation of a of a
 
04:54:35.750 --> 04:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
of an understanding between the citizens
 
04:54:38.150 --> 04:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
themselves and those that are elected in
 
04:54:40.110 --> 04:54:40.120 align:start position:0%
office so with that I'll end my
 
04:54:41.708 --> 04:54:41.718 align:start position:0%
testimony if there's any questions I
 
04:54:44.910 --> 04:54:44.920 align:start position:0%
will gladly take them thank you to all
 
04:54:46.910 --> 04:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
representative bur you have a
 
04:54:49.430 --> 04:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you Mr chair thank
 
04:54:51.510 --> 04:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
you uh representative and thank you for
 
04:54:52.948 --> 04:54:52.958 align:start position:0%
your kind words
 
04:54:55.990 --> 04:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
earlier um using the example of seab
 
04:54:58.310 --> 04:54:58.320 align:start position:0%
brook let's say C Brook is not having a
 
04:55:00.350 --> 04:55:00.360 align:start position:0%
teeny weeny leak let's say C Brook is
 
04:55:04.910 --> 04:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
melting down okay and the Governor even
 
04:55:07.868 --> 04:55:07.878 align:start position:0%
in your scenario wishes to call the
 
04:55:10.548 --> 04:55:10.558 align:start position:0%
legislature back to session let's say
 
04:55:14.670 --> 04:55:14.680 align:start position:0%
that will take 2448 hours is it your
 
04:55:17.830 --> 04:55:17.840 align:start position:0%
position that the governor should not be
 
04:55:21.548 --> 04:55:21.558 align:start position:0%
allowed to issue an immediate order
 
04:55:23.948 --> 04:55:23.958 align:start position:0%
saying nobody shall be within a thousand
 
04:55:27.548 --> 04:55:27.558 align:start position:0%
feet of seabook as it's spewing forth
 
04:55:29.868 --> 04:55:29.878 align:start position:0%
radiation um thank you representative
 
04:55:31.948 --> 04:55:31.958 align:start position:0%
Burch I like for the record I liked your
 
04:55:33.868 --> 04:55:33.878 align:start position:0%
former background better than this one
 
04:55:36.150 --> 04:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
but they're both very good
 
04:55:38.788 --> 04:55:38.798 align:start position:0%
um the background of the state house um
 
04:55:41.948 --> 04:55:41.958 align:start position:0%
chamber was really cool I can see that
 
04:55:43.510 --> 04:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
saying that no one would should be
 
04:55:46.270 --> 04:55:46.280 align:start position:0%
within a thousand feet of Seabrook is
 
04:55:48.670 --> 04:55:48.680 align:start position:0%
reasonable but back to my example about
 
04:55:50.788 --> 04:55:50.798 align:start position:0%
the freedom of press I don't think the
 
04:55:52.868 --> 04:55:52.878 align:start position:0%
governor should be allowed to say well
 
04:55:54.750 --> 04:55:54.760 align:start position:0%
but the but the union leader can't
 
04:55:56.110 --> 04:55:56.120 align:start position:0%
report on what's going on because this
 
04:55:58.470 --> 04:55:58.480 align:start position:0%
could create Mass hysteria I think
 
04:56:00.670 --> 04:56:00.680 align:start position:0%
having real information provided by an
 
04:56:03.430 --> 04:56:03.440 align:start position:0%
independent outside private organization
 
04:56:06.628 --> 04:56:06.638 align:start position:0%
known as The Press whether that's people
 
04:56:09.190 --> 04:56:09.200 align:start position:0%
on blogs or whether that's newspapers or
 
04:56:12.110 --> 04:56:12.120 align:start position:0%
Media or TV media I think there's real
 
04:56:16.270 --> 04:56:16.280 align:start position:0%
value in making sure that if that
 
04:56:17.670 --> 04:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
everything outlined in the Bill of
 
04:56:20.548 --> 04:56:20.558 align:start position:0%
Rights is is clearly
 
04:56:23.150 --> 04:56:23.160 align:start position:0%
protected did I answer your
 
04:56:25.628 --> 04:56:25.638 align:start position:0%
question um I didn't wasn't really
 
04:56:27.868 --> 04:56:27.878 align:start position:0%
talking about the media I was talking
 
04:56:30.350 --> 04:56:30.360 align:start position:0%
about barring individuals I'll give you
 
04:56:32.350 --> 04:56:32.360 align:start position:0%
the thousand feet he the governor could
 
04:56:34.150 --> 04:56:34.160 align:start position:0%
clearly call the house and S it into
 
04:56:36.510 --> 04:56:36.520 align:start position:0%
session immediately um conquered may not
 
04:56:38.990 --> 04:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
be close or may be too close given your
 
04:56:41.310 --> 04:56:41.320 align:start position:0%
hypothetical and we have to meet up in I
 
04:56:44.070 --> 04:56:44.080 align:start position:0%
don't know Brenton Woods and it may take
 
04:56:46.190 --> 04:56:46.200 align:start position:0%
a week to get that orchestrated but in
 
04:56:48.750 --> 04:56:48.760 align:start position:0%
that mean same time right I go through
 
04:56:51.030 --> 04:56:51.040 align:start position:0%
the list of things that are in part 1
 
04:56:54.750 --> 04:56:54.760 align:start position:0%
Article 1 through 39 and I'm not sure
 
04:56:56.590 --> 04:56:56.600 align:start position:0%
when I read
 
04:56:59.670 --> 04:56:59.680 align:start position:0%
these um these protections outlined as
 
04:57:02.750 --> 04:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
the Bill of Rights right um that we
 
04:57:04.788 --> 04:57:04.798 align:start position:0%
should be spending any of
 
04:57:06.990 --> 04:57:07.000 align:start position:0%
them all right thank
 
04:57:10.788 --> 04:57:10.798 align:start position:0%

hypotheticals but in absolute historical
 
04:59:19.430 --> 04:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
fact uh the event was Katrina down
 
04:59:21.990 --> 04:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
south and the
 
04:59:25.910 --> 04:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
authorities acting on emergency Powers
 
04:59:29.990 --> 04:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
went in and disarmed forcefully
 
04:59:32.030 --> 04:59:32.040 align:start position:0%
disarmed peaceful
 
04:59:34.430 --> 04:59:34.440 align:start position:0%
people doing nothing but protecting
 
04:59:36.390 --> 04:59:36.400 align:start position:0%
their own property and not even
 
04:59:38.990 --> 04:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
brandishing firearms in one famous
 
04:59:42.510 --> 04:59:42.520 align:start position:0%
instance a little old lady remarked to
 
04:59:46.230 --> 04:59:46.240 align:start position:0%
an officer that she would be fine she
 
04:59:47.150 --> 04:59:47.160 align:start position:0%
had a
 
04:59:49.788 --> 04:59:49.798 align:start position:0%
revolver the officer knocked her to the
 
04:59:52.990 --> 04:59:53.000 align:start position:0%
ground on TV knocked her to the ground
 
04:59:56.708 --> 04:59:56.718 align:start position:0%
and forcibly disarmed her she then had
 
04:59:58.150 --> 04:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
to be
 
05:00:00.270 --> 05:00:00.280 align:start position:0%
evacuated that this can't be allowed to
 
05:00:04.670 --> 05:00:04.680 align:start position:0%
happen not in a hypothetical in a in a
 
05:00:07.548 --> 05:00:07.558 align:start position:0%
situation where civil
 
05:00:10.548 --> 05:00:10.558 align:start position:0%
Authority is no longer able to protect
 
05:00:13.670 --> 05:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
the citizens the citizens must not be
 
05:00:16.190 --> 05:00:16.200 align:start position:0%
presented from protecting
 
05:00:19.430 --> 05:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
themselves part of that is the first
 
05:00:22.070 --> 05:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
amendment they have to know what is
 
05:00:24.110 --> 05:00:24.120 align:start position:0%
happening around them there must be
 
05:00:28.830 --> 05:00:28.840 align:start position:0%
freedom of speech there must be informed
 
05:00:30.830 --> 05:00:30.840 align:start position:0%
decisionmaking that's the very
 
05:00:33.708 --> 05:00:33.718 align:start position:0%
Foundation of our document
 
05:00:37.110 --> 05:00:37.120 align:start position:0%

05:00:40.548 --> 05:00:40.558 align:start position:0%
away and there is
 
05:00:42.670 --> 05:00:42.680 align:start position:0%

05:00:46.590 --> 05:00:46.600 align:start position:0%
person the house nobody has legitimacy
 
05:00:50.708 --> 05:00:50.718 align:start position:0%
anymore because it is no longer we the

05:02:33.270 --> 05:02:33.280 align:start position:0%
much um Mr chair I appreciate your
 
05:02:37.350 --> 05:02:37.360 align:start position:0%
courtesy um I um am here to introduce
 
05:02:38.510 --> 05:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
05:02:43.190 --> 05:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
418 relative to Supreme Court Reporting
 
05:02:45.948 --> 05:02:45.958 align:start position:0%
this is a bill that I submitted at the
 
05:02:49.190 --> 05:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
request of the judicial branch I don't
 
05:02:51.548 --> 05:02:51.558 align:start position:0%
want to say it's a simple bill or a
 
05:02:53.750 --> 05:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
housekeeping bill because we all know
 
05:02:56.470 --> 05:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
when you say that that that makes every
 
05:03:00.750 --> 05:03:00.760 align:start position:0%
legislator nervous um but what this is
 
05:03:04.830 --> 05:03:04.840 align:start position:0%
is a bill that acknowledges the changes
 
05:03:09.788 --> 05:03:09.798 align:start position:0%
that have taken place um in how we keep
 
05:03:12.830 --> 05:03:12.840 align:start position:0%
records how we share records how we
 
05:03:16.868 --> 05:03:16.878 align:start position:0%
report records and I cannot be more
 
05:03:20.310 --> 05:03:20.320 align:start position:0%
pleased to see that it is at least one
 
05:03:22.708 --> 05:03:22.718 align:start position:0%
example of the third branch of
 
05:03:25.708 --> 05:03:25.718 align:start position:0%
government wanting to move itself into
 
05:03:28.670 --> 05:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
the current century or the current
 
05:03:31.230 --> 05:03:31.240 align:start position:0%
decade sometimes that is a branch that's
 
05:03:34.150 --> 05:03:34.160 align:start position:0%
a little slow to do do that and that
 
05:03:37.590 --> 05:03:37.600 align:start position:0%
they are acknowledging changes right now
 
05:03:39.990 --> 05:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
um I think is something that
 
05:03:43.470 --> 05:03:43.480 align:start position:0%
shows uh great progress and something
 
05:03:46.868 --> 05:03:46.878 align:start position:0%
that would be important and valuable for
 
05:03:50.910 --> 05:03:50.920 align:start position:0%
um state government without in any way
 
05:03:54.390 --> 05:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
compromising any of the our rights or
 
05:03:58.190 --> 05:03:58.200 align:start position:0%
access to information all that this bill
 
05:04:01.708 --> 05:04:01.718 align:start position:0%
does is acknowledge that the system that
 
05:04:03.230 --> 05:04:03.240 align:start position:0%
was in
 
05:04:05.910 --> 05:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
La um for
 
05:04:07.910 --> 05:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
producing uh
 
05:04:11.910 --> 05:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
documents um might have outlived its
 
05:04:15.788 --> 05:04:15.798 align:start position:0%
usefulness and its cost is
 
05:04:18.708 --> 05:04:18.718 align:start position:0%
significant um I I am pleased to see
 
05:04:21.910 --> 05:04:21.920 align:start position:0%
that for this bill um uh representative
 
05:04:24.470 --> 05:04:24.480 align:start position:0%
Burch has decided to move from the state
 
05:04:27.670 --> 05:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
house or a lovely outdoor site to a law
 
05:04:31.670 --> 05:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
library and he I hope does that to
 
05:04:31.680 --> 05:04:33.430 align:start position:0%
library and he I hope does that to
recognize

05:04:33.430 --> 05:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
recognize
 
05:04:38.110 --> 05:04:38.120 align:start position:0%
that um what this bill does is to um
 
05:04:41.590 --> 05:04:41.600 align:start position:0%
make it possible to use modern uh means
 
05:04:44.788 --> 05:04:44.798 align:start position:0%
of technology to distribute information
 
05:04:48.230 --> 05:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
about the work of the court and I would
 
05:04:53.030 --> 05:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
ask the committee to support um uh this
 
05:04:56.868 --> 05:04:56.878 align:start position:0%
legislation that as I say was um
 
05:05:01.788 --> 05:05:01.798 align:start position:0%
submitted at the request of um of the
 
05:05:04.350 --> 05:05:04.360 align:start position:0%
judicial branch
 
05:05:06.868 --> 05:05:06.878 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
05:05:09.990 --> 05:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
chair thank you are there any questions
 
05:05:12.910 --> 05:05:12.920 align:start position:0%
oh there is a question representative
 
05:05:16.030 --> 05:05:16.040 align:start position:0%
bur thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:05:18.310 --> 05:05:18.320 align:start position:0%
representative and Madam chair for
 
05:05:21.868 --> 05:05:21.878 align:start position:0%
taking my question it'll be very brief
 
05:05:26.510 --> 05:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
uh as I read the bill at at line 16 it
 
05:05:28.670 --> 05:05:28.680 align:start position:0%
would allow the Supreme Court to
 
05:05:31.190 --> 05:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
eliminate these volumes that you see
 
05:05:33.190 --> 05:05:33.200 align:start position:0%
virtually behind me
 
05:05:36.230 --> 05:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
and I may be an old traditionalist and
 
05:05:38.510 --> 05:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
the like
 
05:05:42.590 --> 05:05:42.600 align:start position:0%
um is that the intent of the bill to say
 
05:05:45.628 --> 05:05:45.638 align:start position:0%
that these kind of volumes will possibly
 
05:05:49.628 --> 05:05:49.638 align:start position:0%
no longer be uh uh
 
05:05:54.948 --> 05:05:54.958 align:start position:0%
published um I I think that that is in
 
05:05:58.510 --> 05:05:58.520 align:start position:0%
fact a possible alternative if I had
 
05:06:02.430 --> 05:06:02.440 align:start position:0%
more um skill with zoom I would IM
 
05:06:04.788 --> 05:06:04.798 align:start position:0%
immediately changed my background to one
 
05:06:08.150 --> 05:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
of my library to show how I value the
 
05:06:11.430 --> 05:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
written word and do not value the
 
05:06:14.470 --> 05:06:14.480 align:start position:0%
absence of a book in my hands but I
 
05:06:20.390 --> 05:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
would ask um Mr uh chair that um you
 
05:06:26.270 --> 05:06:26.280 align:start position:0%
might recognize um Lori Platt who is um
 
05:06:30.190 --> 05:06:30.200 align:start position:0%
here and represented the court who would
 
05:06:33.350 --> 05:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
be able to I think answer um
 
05:06:35.430 --> 05:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
representative burch's question with
 
05:06:39.190 --> 05:06:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:43.030 --> 05:06:43.040 align:start position:0%

05:07:45.600 --> 05:07:47.230 align:start position:0%
but doesn't seem to be
working

05:07:47.230 --> 05:07:47.240 align:start position:0%
working
 
05:07:49.868 --> 05:07:49.878 align:start position:0%
and is there anyone else who hasn't
 
05:07:53.430 --> 05:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
testified on House Bill 440 who wishes
 
05:07:57.830 --> 05:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:00.788 --> 05:08:00.798 align:start position:0%
440 it was someone else who appeared to
 
05:08:08.830 --> 05:08:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:12.708 --> 05:08:12.718 align:start position:0%
but I don't see anyone so we'll that's
 
05:08:15.390 --> 05:08:15.400 align:start position:0%
fine we'll close the hearing on
 
05:08:18.030 --> 05:08:18.040 align:start position:0%
representative honorable Hull had a
 
05:08:23.470 --> 05:08:23.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:26.708 --> 05:08:26.718 align:start position:0%
I yes you'd like to be heard again thank
 
05:08:30.390 --> 05:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
you chairman Gordon um just uh I want to
 
05:08:32.390 --> 05:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
point out for the record that my my
 
05:08:34.670 --> 05:08:34.680 align:start position:0%
hypothetical example was an extreme one
 
05:08:37.230 --> 05:08:37.240 align:start position:0%
because and it was so we should note
 
05:08:39.910 --> 05:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
that um a melt a meltdown at C Brook is
 
05:08:42.230 --> 05:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
a serious serious serious issue the most
 
05:08:44.350 --> 05:08:44.360 align:start position:0%
serious I could think of on the spot so
 
05:08:46.548 --> 05:08:46.558 align:start position:0%
I would wish that on no one and I just
 
05:08:48.548 --> 05:08:48.558 align:start position:0%
wanted to make that further record I was
 
05:08:50.430 --> 05:08:50.440 align:start position:0%
just picking the most extreme example I
 
05:08:52.670 --> 05:08:52.680 align:start position:0%
could think of for a state of emergency
 
05:08:56.788 --> 05:08:56.798 align:start position:0%
so thank you everyone thank
 
05:09:01.110 --> 05:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
you and uh with that I'll declare the
 
05:09:06.350 --> 05:09:06.360 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 440 closed and go
 
05:09:09.350 --> 05:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
back and reopen the hearing on House
 
05:09:09.360 --> 05:09:10.350 align:start position:0%
back and reopen the hearing on House
Bill

05:09:10.350 --> 05:09:10.360 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
05:09:22.350 --> 05:09:22.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:31.110 --> 05:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:31.120 --> 05:09:32.868 align:start position:0%
 
there

05:09:32.868 --> 05:09:32.878 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:09:38.510 --> 05:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:53.390 --> 05:09:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:56.110 --> 05:09:56.120 align:start position:0%
end perhaps the clerk could try in case
 
05:10:01.030 --> 05:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:05.990 --> 05:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
end Jen are you there I am um the only
 
05:10:08.190 --> 05:10:08.200 align:start position:0%
thing I can think of is let's um I'm
 
05:10:10.190 --> 05:10:10.200 align:start position:0%
going to try to promote her and see if
 
05:10:24.548 --> 05:10:24.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:27.310 --> 05:10:27.320 align:start position:0%
us attorney plat you're unmuted if you
 
05:10:27.320 --> 05:10:31.030 align:start position:0%
us attorney plat you're unmuted if you
could

05:10:31.030 --> 05:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:31.040 --> 05:10:37.150 align:start position:0%
 
speak

05:10:37.150 --> 05:10:37.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:40.708 --> 05:10:40.718 align:start position:0%
is her computer volume all the way down
 
05:10:43.310 --> 05:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
maybe yeah that's all I can assume is
 
05:10:50.470 --> 05:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:53.670 --> 05:10:53.680 align:start position:0%
end there is a mic
 
05:10:53.680 --> 05:10:55.350 align:start position:0%
end there is a mic
connected

05:10:55.350 --> 05:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
connected
 
05:10:58.830 --> 05:10:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:01.628 --> 05:11:01.638 align:start position:0%
connecting it says she can obviously
 
05:11:02.790 --> 05:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
hear us
 
05:11:02.800 --> 05:11:11.868 align:start position:0%
hear us
[Music]

05:11:11.868 --> 05:11:11.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:13.590 --> 05:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
attorney plat it looks like you might be
 
05:11:26.708 --> 05:11:26.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:29.548 --> 05:11:29.558 align:start position:0%
you do
 
05:11:33.390 --> 05:11:33.400 align:start position:0%
you perhaps if if we're not connecting
 
05:11:50.628 --> 05:11:50.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:53.150 --> 05:11:53.160 align:start position:0%
in in the meantime is there anybody else
 
05:12:00.868 --> 05:12:00.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:00.878 --> 05:12:02.810 align:start position:0%

05:12:15.230 --> 05:12:15.240 align:start position:0%
Mike thoron did you want to speak on
 
05:12:16.910 --> 05:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
this bill or were you I know you spoke
 
05:12:21.430 --> 05:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:24.350 --> 05:12:24.360 align:start position:0%
bill yes sir Mr chair I I do wish to
 
05:12:27.070 --> 05:12:27.080 align:start position:0%
speak briefly on this bill as well okay
 
05:12:31.548 --> 05:12:31.558 align:start position:0%
if you look at George Orwell 1984 the
 
05:12:33.990 --> 05:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
first first thing they did is they got
 
05:12:37.788 --> 05:12:37.798 align:start position:0%
rid of the written word so that history
 
05:12:40.910 --> 05:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
could be changed at any moment and no
 
05:12:42.390 --> 05:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
one would be the
 
05:12:44.590 --> 05:12:44.600 align:start position:0%
wiser I'm not
 
05:12:44.600 --> 05:12:46.350 align:start position:0%
wiser I'm not
saying

05:12:46.350 --> 05:12:46.360 align:start position:0%
saying
 
05:12:50.948 --> 05:12:50.958 align:start position:0%
have Tes of useless paper lying around
 
05:12:54.590 --> 05:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
but there needs to be an immutable trail
 
05:12:57.150 --> 05:12:57.160 align:start position:0%
that any citizen can
 
05:13:03.110 --> 05:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
access and rely upon that there is a a
 
05:13:08.510 --> 05:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
reliable source of any changes to law or
 
05:13:11.708 --> 05:13:11.718 align:start position:0%
fact for the protection of the entire
 
05:13:15.310 --> 05:13:15.320 align:start position:0%
public thank you very much thank
 
05:13:18.830 --> 05:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
you any questions for Mr
 
05:13:21.070 --> 05:13:21.080 align:start position:0%
Thornton seeing none thank you for your
 
05:13:21.080 --> 05:13:25.110 align:start position:0%
Thornton seeing none thank you for your
testimony

05:13:25.110 --> 05:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:25.120 --> 05:13:28.910 align:start position:0%
 
today

05:13:28.910 --> 05:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:32.110 --> 05:13:32.120 align:start position:0%
and um representative Gordon my only
 
05:13:36.868 --> 05:13:36.878 align:start position:0%
last idea would be um if attorney Platt
 
05:13:39.110 --> 05:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
happens to have connected by
 
05:13:45.470 --> 05:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
phone to um raise her hand with star
 
05:13:49.230 --> 05:13:49.240 align:start position:0%
N I just see one Callin call-in user but
 
05:13:51.230 --> 05:13:51.240 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that that is
 
05:13:51.240 --> 05:13:55.470 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that that is
her

05:13:55.470 --> 05:13:55.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:58.590 --> 05:13:58.600 align:start position:0%
yep there a
 
05:14:04.948 --> 05:14:04.958 align:start position:0%
h i can try yeah there is that you miss
 
05:14:08.270 --> 05:14:08.280 align:start position:0%
plat you have to
 
05:14:14.548 --> 05:14:14.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:18.948 --> 05:14:18.958 align:start position:0%
six there we go can you actually hear me
 
05:14:20.830 --> 05:14:20.840 align:start position:0%
oh thank
 
05:14:23.990 --> 05:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
you if you just um mute your computer
 
05:14:26.190 --> 05:14:26.200 align:start position:0%
because we're getting a little
 
05:14:29.430 --> 05:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
feedback okay now now is it
 
05:14:32.310 --> 05:14:32.320 align:start position:0%
working yes it's much better perfect
 
05:14:35.708 --> 05:14:35.718 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much um first of all
 
05:14:37.390 --> 05:14:37.400 align:start position:0%
I'd like to thank um representative
 
05:14:39.830 --> 05:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
Smith for sponsoring the bill um I
 
05:14:41.750 --> 05:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
believe representative Burch while we
 
05:14:44.390 --> 05:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
were scrambling to try to unmute me you
 
05:14:45.788 --> 05:14:45.798 align:start position:0%
asked the question about whether we were
 
05:14:49.310 --> 05:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
going to do away with printing the
 
05:14:54.510 --> 05:14:54.520 align:start position:0%
books okay um that may be the goal
 
05:14:56.548 --> 05:14:56.558 align:start position:0%
eventually but right now what we're
 
05:14:59.270 --> 05:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
trying to do is make our opinions more
 
05:15:03.390 --> 05:15:03.400 align:start position:0%
accessible to everyone and so um this
 
05:15:05.190 --> 05:15:05.200 align:start position:0%
bill would accomplish two things and can
 
05:15:07.470 --> 05:15:07.480 align:start position:0%
I just discuss one very minor point this
 
05:15:09.910 --> 05:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
bill would also make the statutes gender
 
05:15:12.310 --> 05:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
neutral um right now they refer to the
 
05:15:15.030 --> 05:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
reporter as a he but the other is to
 
05:15:16.708 --> 05:15:16.718 align:start position:0%
allow the court to move from publishing
 
05:15:19.548 --> 05:15:19.558 align:start position:0%
its decisions in Bound volumes to having
 
05:15:21.430 --> 05:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
the ability to publish the official
 
05:15:24.390 --> 05:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
version online and eventually to have
 
05:15:26.788 --> 05:15:26.798 align:start position:0%
our the opinions on our website be
 
05:15:30.310 --> 05:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
searchable um the current intention of
 
05:15:32.350 --> 05:15:32.360 align:start position:0%
the court is not to do away with
 
05:15:33.948 --> 05:15:33.958 align:start position:0%
publishing the volumes but you should
 
05:15:35.628 --> 05:15:35.638 align:start position:0%
know that the demand for published
 
05:15:39.350 --> 05:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
volumes is going down so and as a result
 
05:15:41.670 --> 05:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
the price for publishing them is in all
 
05:15:43.990 --> 05:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
likelihood going to increase as we go
 
05:15:47.230 --> 05:15:47.240 align:start position:0%
forward um I think it will take some
 
05:15:50.190 --> 05:15:50.200 align:start position:0%
time to do this uh
 
05:15:53.030 --> 05:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
certainly I've met with Terry faf and
 
05:15:56.030 --> 05:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
Scott Kelly because we are kind of we're
 
05:15:57.628 --> 05:15:57.638 align:start position:0%
hoping to develop some sort of
 
05:15:59.590 --> 05:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
searchable database much as you have the
 
05:16:03.230 --> 05:16:03.240 align:start position:0%
bill status search um
 
05:16:05.548 --> 05:16:05.558 align:start position:0%
capability which you may or may not know
 
05:16:07.750 --> 05:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
was developed by your own IT staff I
 
05:16:07.760 --> 05:16:09.350 align:start position:0%
was developed by your own IT staff I
believe

05:16:09.350 --> 05:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
believe
 
05:16:12.390 --> 05:16:12.400 align:start position:0%
so I do think that eventually we will
 
05:16:14.948 --> 05:16:14.958 align:start position:0%
not have printed books but that's not
 
05:16:22.670 --> 05:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:25.948 --> 05:16:25.958 align:start position:0%
immediately yes representative
 
05:16:28.910 --> 05:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
Sylvia thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
05:16:31.350 --> 05:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question attorney PL
 
05:16:35.788 --> 05:16:35.798 align:start position:0%
um um previous speaker spoke to uh the
 
05:16:38.548 --> 05:16:38.558 align:start position:0%
possibility of an an immutable record
 
05:16:42.070 --> 05:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
and I know that the technology is coming
 
05:16:44.110 --> 05:16:44.120 align:start position:0%
around with all the blockchain stuff
 
05:16:47.590 --> 05:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
that goes on is there an intention or a
 
05:16:50.948 --> 05:16:50.958 align:start position:0%
thought or consideration toward um
 
05:16:55.628 --> 05:16:55.638 align:start position:0%
assuring that the original source is U
 
05:16:58.750 --> 05:16:58.760 align:start position:0%
maintained in some fashion where it it
 
05:16:58.760 --> 05:16:59.548 align:start position:0%
maintained in some fashion where it it
can

05:16:59.548 --> 05:16:59.558 align:start position:0%
can
 
05:17:03.708 --> 05:17:03.718 align:start position:0%
be known that it is the
 
05:17:06.110 --> 05:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
original we actually have a study
 
05:17:08.708 --> 05:17:08.718 align:start position:0%
committee uh or I gather it's a working
 
05:17:11.190 --> 05:17:11.200 align:start position:0%
committee with our law librarian who is
 
05:17:13.708 --> 05:17:13.718 align:start position:0%
looking at that exact issue among many
 
05:17:17.990 --> 05:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
other issues um so it's definitely uh
 
05:17:20.750 --> 05:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
something that we is on the our radar so
 
05:17:22.190 --> 05:17:22.200 align:start position:0%
to speak and it definitely would be
 
05:17:26.548 --> 05:17:26.558 align:start position:0%
considered uh as we move forward at
 
05:17:30.390 --> 05:17:30.400 align:start position:0%

05:17:30.400 --> 05:17:34.150 align:start position:0%
perhaps a somewhat glacial Pace thank
you

05:17:34.150 --> 05:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:38.590 --> 05:17:38.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:41.390 --> 05:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
Lorenzo thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:17:46.150 --> 05:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
for taking my question Miss plat um so
 
05:17:48.350 --> 05:17:48.360 align:start position:0%
looking at a scenario where the law
 
05:17:51.788 --> 05:17:51.798 align:start position:0%
books would be no longer published would
 
05:17:54.390 --> 05:17:54.400 align:start position:0%
the public have access to the online
 
05:17:58.070 --> 05:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
information I mean free access yes thank
 
05:18:00.110 --> 05:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
you that is a great question and that is
 
05:18:02.910 --> 05:18:02.920 align:start position:0%
the goal um you can't the public would
 
05:18:04.788 --> 05:18:04.798 align:start position:0%
have access and does have access right
 
05:18:08.230 --> 05:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
now to court opinions but the the
 
05:18:10.510 --> 05:18:10.520 align:start position:0%
general public cannot search the
 
05:18:13.110 --> 05:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
opinions on our website so for example
 
05:18:16.628 --> 05:18:16.638 align:start position:0%
if you were looking for a case involving
 
05:18:18.628 --> 05:18:18.638 align:start position:0%
uh I guess DUI
 
05:18:21.230 --> 05:18:21.240 align:start position:0%
convictions if you don't have access to
 
05:18:24.430 --> 05:18:24.440 align:start position:0%
a commercial search engine you can't
 
05:18:27.670 --> 05:18:27.680 align:start position:0%
search our opinions and so we'd like to
 
05:18:29.830 --> 05:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
make the the Court's goal is to make the
 
05:18:31.708 --> 05:18:31.718 align:start position:0%
opinions on our website the official
 
05:18:33.990 --> 05:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
version and also at some point to
 
05:18:35.990 --> 05:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
develop a search engine so that members
 
05:18:38.110 --> 05:18:38.120 align:start position:0%
of the general public can actually look
 
05:18:40.270 --> 05:18:40.280 align:start position:0%
at those opinions and find the topic
 
05:18:41.670 --> 05:18:41.680 align:start position:0%
that they're looking
 
05:18:43.948 --> 05:18:43.958 align:start position:0%
for thank
 
05:18:45.780 --> 05:18:45.790 align:start position:0%
you other
 
05:18:45.790 --> 05:18:49.230 align:start position:0%
you other
[Music]

05:18:49.230 --> 05:18:49.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:52.270 --> 05:18:52.280 align:start position:0%
questions do you have a time frame for
 
05:18:55.030 --> 05:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
when you think this is going to
 
05:18:55.040 --> 05:18:56.548 align:start position:0%
when you think this is going to
happen

05:18:56.548 --> 05:18:56.558 align:start position:0%
happen
 
05:19:00.390 --> 05:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
um we would hope we would hope that it
 
05:19:02.310 --> 05:19:02.320 align:start position:0%
has to it really thought to begin at the
 
05:19:03.990 --> 05:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
beginning of a calendar year just
 
05:19:06.670 --> 05:19:06.680 align:start position:0%
because there are a number of different
 
05:19:09.590 --> 05:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
factors that are involved and so if this
 
05:19:12.948 --> 05:19:12.958 align:start position:0%
bill were to pass we would uh begin
 
05:19:17.150 --> 05:19:17.160 align:start position:0%
meeting this summer and by January
 
05:19:19.670 --> 05:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
hopefully uh the goal would be to
 
05:19:21.708 --> 05:19:21.718 align:start position:0%
declare the opinions on our website as
 
05:19:23.948 --> 05:19:23.958 align:start position:0%
the official version that doesn't mean
 
05:19:25.310 --> 05:19:25.320 align:start position:0%
we would stop publishing the New
 
05:19:27.390 --> 05:19:27.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire reports I don't see that
 
05:19:29.590 --> 05:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
happening based on my conversations with
 
05:19:33.948 --> 05:19:33.958 align:start position:0%
the court a for some time in fact we
 
05:19:36.470 --> 05:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
have a publication contract uh that
 
05:19:38.628 --> 05:19:38.638 align:start position:0%
covers the next few volumes of the New
 
05:19:40.270 --> 05:19:40.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire report
 
05:19:42.990 --> 05:19:43.000 align:start position:0%
so that's why the bill is drafted as it
 
05:19:49.230 --> 05:19:49.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:53.190 --> 05:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
time if I could just follow up on that
 
05:19:58.150 --> 05:19:58.160 align:start position:0%
so is there a need right now to indicate
 
05:20:01.310 --> 05:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
that the reports can be either in the
 
05:20:05.230 --> 05:20:05.240 align:start position:0%
form of the written form or on the
 
05:20:05.240 --> 05:20:07.070 align:start position:0%
form of the written form or on the
website

05:20:07.070 --> 05:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
website
 
05:20:09.788 --> 05:20:09.798 align:start position:0%
form as long as you're authorized to do
 
05:20:13.990 --> 05:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:16.510 --> 05:20:16.520 align:start position:0%
website well we I mean the court would
 
05:20:19.830 --> 05:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
like to declare that the opinions on the
 
05:20:22.030 --> 05:20:22.040 align:start position:0%
website are the official
 
05:20:22.040 --> 05:20:23.070 align:start position:0%
website are the official
version

05:20:23.070 --> 05:20:23.080 align:start position:0%
version
 
05:20:23.080 --> 05:20:24.470 align:start position:0%
version
[Music]

05:20:24.470 --> 05:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:20:27.910 --> 05:20:27.920 align:start position:0%
um so I I'm not sure that I understand
 
05:20:27.920 --> 05:20:28.868 align:start position:0%
um so I I'm not sure that I understand
your

05:20:28.868 --> 05:20:28.878 align:start position:0%
your
 
05:20:31.990 --> 05:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
question I don't I don't see anything in
 
05:20:34.190 --> 05:20:34.200 align:start position:0%
here that says that the
 
05:20:38.948 --> 05:20:38.958 align:start position:0%
reports are the official version
 
05:20:42.708 --> 05:20:42.718 align:start position:0%
um it just says the reports may be
 
05:20:45.948 --> 05:20:45.958 align:start position:0%
published either in volumes entitled The
 
05:20:49.230 --> 05:20:49.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire reports or on the Supreme
 
05:20:49.240 --> 05:20:50.670 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire reports or on the Supreme
Court

05:20:50.670 --> 05:20:50.680 align:start position:0%
Court
 
05:20:53.230 --> 05:20:53.240 align:start position:0%
website so that doesn't seem to be
 
05:20:57.990 --> 05:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
anything and and so if I read it
 
05:20:59.470 --> 05:20:59.480 align:start position:0%
actually if I read it literally that
 
05:21:03.708 --> 05:21:03.718 align:start position:0%
means it can be one or the other but um
 
05:21:06.110 --> 05:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
I'm presuming that it could be both I
 
05:21:09.430 --> 05:21:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:11.948 --> 05:21:11.958 align:start position:0%
there if we if you give you the
 
05:21:14.990 --> 05:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
authority to put it on the website it
 
05:21:17.190 --> 05:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
isn't necessarily making it the official
 
05:21:18.548 --> 05:21:18.558 align:start position:0%
opinion is
 
05:21:21.830 --> 05:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
it not not immediately although that
 
05:21:25.070 --> 05:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
would be our goal as soon as we as soon
 
05:21:27.708 --> 05:21:27.718 align:start position:0%
I I think that would be the goal uh we
 
05:21:29.190 --> 05:21:29.200 align:start position:0%
again I don't know how long it's going
 
05:21:32.070 --> 05:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
to take to develop the search engine
 
05:21:35.910 --> 05:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
um so section two of the bill talks
 
05:21:40.750 --> 05:21:40.760 align:start position:0%
about amending RSA 505 colon 8 and the
 
05:21:43.590 --> 05:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment Rome three would
 
05:21:46.708 --> 05:21:46.718 align:start position:0%
allow us to publish in volumes as well
 
05:21:48.510 --> 05:21:48.520 align:start position:0%
as on the Supreme Court website there'll
 
05:21:54.430 --> 05:21:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:59.470 --> 05:21:59.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:01.590 --> 05:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
questions see none thanks for your
 
05:22:05.990 --> 05:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
testimony today thank you very much
 
05:22:08.548 --> 05:22:08.558 align:start position:0%
okay and is there anybody else who
 
05:22:13.548 --> 05:22:13.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:17.548 --> 05:22:17.558 align:start position:0%
opportunity seeing none we close the
 
05:22:20.868 --> 05:22:20.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:25.150 --> 05:22:25.160 align:start position:0%
418 and is there any other business I I
 
05:22:27.390 --> 05:22:27.400 align:start position:0%
know for the Republicans we do have a
 
05:22:29.948 --> 05:22:29.958 align:start position:0%
caucus on Sunday
 
05:22:33.350 --> 05:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
afternoon from three to
 
05:22:33.360 --> 05:22:35.788 align:start position:0%
afternoon from three to
five

05:22:35.788 --> 05:22:35.798 align:start position:0%
five
 
05:22:39.150 --> 05:22:39.160 align:start position:0%
and um is there any other business that
 
05:22:43.470 --> 05:22:43.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:47.390 --> 05:22:47.400 align:start position:0%
today no thank you all for taking the
 
05:22:49.990 --> 05:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
time today I know it's been a full week
 
05:22:52.470 --> 05:22:52.480 align:start position:0%
it's the legislature's become a
 
05:22:55.270 --> 05:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
full-time job here and I don't know
 
05:22:57.070 --> 05:22:57.080 align:start position:0%
somebody's mentioned a couple different
 
05:22:59.270 --> 05:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
people have mentioned the emails but
 
05:23:01.270 --> 05:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
when I got home last Friday I had over a
 
05:23:04.990 --> 05:23:05.000 align:start position:0%
thousand emails in my box and I'm sure
 
05:23:07.150 --> 05:23:07.160 align:start position:0%
you're all getting inundated as
 
05:23:10.670 --> 05:23:10.680 align:start position:0%
well yes representative Chase yes I was
 
05:23:12.510 --> 05:23:12.520 align:start position:0%
just wondering if there's a pay raise in
 
05:23:12.520 --> 05:23:15.750 align:start position:0%
just wondering if there's a pay raise in
our

05:23:15.750 --> 05:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:19.510 --> 05:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
future I wouldn't count on it funny well
 
05:23:21.110 --> 05:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
funny should mention that I'm
 
05:23:24.548 --> 05:23:24.558 align:start position:0%
co-sponsoring a cacr with rep MC
 
05:23:26.070 --> 05:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
Williams and the effect of that would be
 
05:23:29.548 --> 05:23:29.558 align:start position:0%
to uh take out the $100 a year from the
 
05:23:31.708 --> 05:23:31.718 align:start position:0%
Constitution which time was 12th the
 
05:23:34.548 --> 05:23:34.558 align:start position:0%
governor's statute and then uh let the
 
05:23:36.830 --> 05:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
legislature determine it by Statute um
 
05:23:40.030 --> 05:23:40.040 align:start position:0%
that's an idea that not seem to be met
 
05:23:41.708 --> 05:23:41.718 align:start position:0%
with much enthusiasm I don't think we
 
05:23:44.110 --> 05:23:44.120 align:start position:0%
can get past the 60% of the membership
 
05:23:46.910 --> 05:23:46.920 align:start position:0%
of the house let alone 60% of the Senate
 
05:23:49.750 --> 05:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
and two-thirds of the people but it's a
 
05:23:51.990 --> 05:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's a remote possibility but that
 
05:23:53.670 --> 05:23:53.680 align:start position:0%
would not take effect for a few years
 
05:23:56.868 --> 05:23:56.878 align:start position:0%
even if it goes anywhere so can't stay
 
05:23:59.788 --> 05:23:59.798 align:start position:0%
remote and legislature at the same
 
05:24:03.310 --> 05:24:03.320 align:start position:0%
sentence yeah I'm I'm taking all of this
 
05:24:07.510 --> 05:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
as a no I will not see an extra paycheck
 
05:24:10.030 --> 05:24:10.040 align:start position:0%
no not looking that way and actually
 
05:24:12.230 --> 05:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
we're we're not getting the mileage
 
05:24:16.430 --> 05:24:16.440 align:start position:0%
checks this year zooming so that's the
 
05:24:17.708 --> 05:24:17.718 align:start position:0%
the way it goes
 
05:24:22.150 --> 05:24:22.160 align:start position:0%
and more work and a cut back yeah got it
 
05:24:23.750 --> 05:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
and not only that if you're retired and
 
05:24:25.390 --> 05:24:25.400 align:start position:0%
you have money in the stock market it's
 
05:24:29.030 --> 05:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
been a very bad week as well I might
 
05:24:31.590 --> 05:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
ask anyway we'll see you we'll see you
