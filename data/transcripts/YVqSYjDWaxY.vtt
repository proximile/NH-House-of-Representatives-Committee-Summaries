is allen's town epsom and pittsfield i'm
 
00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 align:start position:0%
introducing senate bill 313
 
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 align:start position:0%
in lieu of senator gaida who is
 
00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 align:start position:0%
unavailable at the moment he will be
 
00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 align:start position:0%
and this is a bill to clean up
 
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 align:start position:0%
the problem between the oplc having
 
00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 align:start position:0%
authority to
 
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
set fees
 
00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 align:start position:0%
for the licensing boards
 
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.910 align:start position:0%
for the licensing boards
and

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 align:start position:0%
the boards having statutory license fees
 
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
in there
 
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 align:start position:0%
in their controlling statutes so
 
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 align:start position:0%
the basic part of the bill which starts
 
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 align:start position:0%
on page two
 
00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
deletes the statutory fees for a number
 
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
of boards
 
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
and says that the
 
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 align:start position:0%
it and refers back to the
 
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 align:start position:0%
oplcs authority to set
 
00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.390 align:start position:0%
oplcs authority to set
fees

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 align:start position:0%
there's a study committee in parts one
 
00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 align:start position:0%
and two
 
00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
that i have an amendment which you
 
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 align:start position:0%
should have already that deletes the
 
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 align:start position:0%
study committee because
 
00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 align:start position:0%
we also have senate bill 330 which has a
 
00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 align:start position:0%
study committee on the scope
 
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 align:start position:0%
on the operations of the oplc and i
 
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
think the fee authority ought to be
 
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 align:start position:0%
combined with that study committee
 
00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 align:start position:0%
rather than having two separate ones
 
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
other than that i will try to ask answer
 
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.030 align:start position:0%
other than that i will try to ask answer
questions

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 align:start position:0%
there is one small error that needs to
 
00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
be fixed the
 
00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:29.599 align:start position:0%
has to the
 
00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 align:start position:0%
has to be corrected so that the fees go
 
00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 align:start position:0%
into the
 
00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:36.879 align:start position:0%
oplc fund rather than the general fund
 
00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:39.110 align:start position:0%
oplc fund rather than the general fund
because

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.910 align:start position:0%
because
uh

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:42.159 align:start position:0%
because of the change in the
 
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 align:start position:0%
connections or attachment
 
00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 align:start position:0%
uh thank you um
 
00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.789 align:start position:0%
looking at
um

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
page three starting at line 19 it's
 
00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319 align:start position:0%
about i think that's right well 21.
 
00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 align:start position:0%
um as i recall we uh we had a bill that
 
00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:06.879 align:start position:0%
eliminated the board of registration
 
00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 align:start position:0%
medical technicians
 
00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:10.159 align:start position:0%
and so how's that going to work if that
 
00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
actually makes it through with this bill
 
00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 align:start position:0%
that's a very good point we if
 
00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.229 align:start position:0%
that's a very good point we if
uh

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 align:start position:0%
assuming that the that
 
00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
we should assume that the bills we have
 
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 align:start position:0%
passed have passed
 
00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:30.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 align:start position:0%
see no further questions thank you
 
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.830 align:start position:0%
see no further questions thank you
representative

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
you have a question
 
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 align:start position:0%
do you plan to put in that amendment
 
00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
uh to change the fee allocation and the
 
00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.110 align:start position:0%
uh to change the fee allocation and the
uh

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
representative i haven't
 
00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919 align:start position:0%
had a chance to create it but i would be
 
00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
would take care of him you're going to
 
00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 align:start position:0%
take care okay
 
00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 align:start position:0%
representative goalie
 
00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 align:start position:0%
thank you just
 
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 align:start position:0%
as i'm going through this i'm just
 
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 align:start position:0%
looking at and i
 
00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 align:start position:0%
still have some
 
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
questions as
 
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
the executive director
 
00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.270 align:start position:0%
the executive director
um

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 align:start position:0%
in the appointing of members
 
00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 align:start position:0%
we're striking out a number of areas
 
00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:27.199 align:start position:0%
where those who
 
00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
seem to have the expertise and i'm
 
00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:29.759 align:start position:0%
looking particularly under the
 
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
that at least four appointed members and
 
00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
this is line 11
 
00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
in consultation with and the state fire
 
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
marshal is now strucking out and it's
 
00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
with the office of professional
 
00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:44.320 align:start position:0%
licensure with the approval of the
 
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:53.039 align:start position:0%
i just want to make sure we're
 
00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:54.479 align:start position:0%
all set with
 
00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
um making sure that it's done correctly
 
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:03.039 align:start position:0%
we make sure it states that the
 
00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:06.160 align:start position:0%
boards specifically
 
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh are consulted and have
 
00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.360 align:start position:0%
recommendations um
 
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
yes that that board is
 
00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
not an advisory board
 
00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
so it does it this says that it
 
00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
it needs an affirmative vote
 
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
and in consulting i mean the currently
 
00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.909 align:start position:0%
and in consulting i mean the currently
the

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:27.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:29.110 align:start position:0%
 
director

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:29.120 align:start position:0%
director
 
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner of safety
 
00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:34.639 align:start position:0%
approves the rules but doesn't actually
 
00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:35.840 align:start position:0%
write them
 
00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:36.790 align:start position:0%
write them
um

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:36.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
and i think this would be the same
 
00:06:39.749 --> 00:06:39.759 align:start position:0%
process that the board develops the
 
00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
rules and and
 
00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:43.360 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of safety makes the
 
00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
formal adoption after the board's
 
00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
through with it
 
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
and that was just my concern because
 
00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
we're striking out the commissioner and
 
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
the state fire marshal now and just
 
00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:54.080 align:start position:0%
specifically pointing in
 
00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.189 align:start position:0%
specifically pointing in
this

00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
executive director
 
00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:57.990 align:start position:0%
executive director
yes

00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
that's because the board has been
 
00:07:06.629 --> 00:07:06.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
is that uh
 
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
i know the mechanical board got moved to
 
00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:12.080 align:start position:0%
oplc is the board of fire control then
 
00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.230 align:start position:0%
oplc is the board of fire control then
moved

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:14.240 align:start position:0%
moved
 
00:07:16.309 --> 00:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
i think we've got somebody from old plc
 
00:07:17.749 --> 00:07:17.759 align:start position:0%
that will that might be
 
00:07:19.749 --> 00:07:19.759 align:start position:0%
better able to answer that question than
 
00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
i am
 
00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
sorry about that
 
00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
representative schuett
 
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um it's looking as
 
00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
though this bill is going to need uh
 
00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:35.360 align:start position:0%
some corrections
 
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
so while you're at it i noticed on page
 
00:07:41.189 --> 00:07:41.199 align:start position:0%
three line 33
 
00:07:45.589 --> 00:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
ophthalmic dispensing should be o p h
 
00:07:48.469 --> 00:07:48.479 align:start position:0%
t h a l m i c
 
00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
there's a spelling error
 
00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:51.720 align:start position:0%
i'm shocked
 
00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:55.029 align:start position:0%
i'm shocked
[Laughter]

00:07:55.029 --> 00:07:55.039 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:56.800 align:start position:0%
filmic dispensers yes that's the most
 
00:08:00.869 --> 00:08:00.879 align:start position:0%
likely one to be uh spelled incorrectly
 
00:08:00.879 --> 00:08:04.550 align:start position:0%
likely one to be uh spelled incorrectly
okay

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:07.749 --> 00:08:07.759 align:start position:0%
it's it's on line 33 you said yeah
 
00:08:07.759 --> 00:08:08.790 align:start position:0%
it's it's on line 33 you said yeah
okay

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
and it's spelled correctly
 
00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
on line 36 so it's
 
00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
i suspect this should go
 
00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
we will need a little combing to get the
 
00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
like i said as long as you're fixing
 
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
other things
 
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
might as well get fixed too oh yeah no
 
00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
sense not no sense leaving a spelling
 
00:08:35.829 --> 00:08:35.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:37.120 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions for
 
00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:38.829 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions for
representative

00:08:38.829 --> 00:08:38.839 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:41.360 align:start position:0%
mcguire thank you representative thank
 
00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.350 align:start position:0%
mcguire thank you representative thank
you

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:43.360 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:08:49.509 --> 00:08:49.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:50.949 --> 00:08:50.959 align:start position:0%
i figured since you were so eager to
 
00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:52.160 align:start position:0%
answer the questions that were asked
 
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
we'll just put you right in the hot seat
 
00:08:57.509 --> 00:08:57.519 align:start position:0%
morning my name is bill trombley and i
 
00:08:58.949 --> 00:08:58.959 align:start position:0%
am representing
 
00:08:58.959 --> 00:08:59.990 align:start position:0%
am representing
the

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
pftf hvac association of new hampshire
 
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
uh and we're in favor of
 
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
313 as it's written i mean i should say
 
00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
amendment of changing the funds to go to
 
00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:13.670 align:start position:0%
amendment of changing the funds to go to
the

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:16.470 align:start position:0%
the
oplc

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
and just to answer the question
 
00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
the way it's written with the mechanical
 
00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:24.800 align:start position:0%
board is the board has to approve
 
00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
everything and then we get the approval
 
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:29.200 align:start position:0%
of either the executive director or the
 
00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.389 align:start position:0%
of either the executive director or the
staff

00:09:30.389 --> 00:09:30.399 align:start position:0%
staff
 
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
um because they help us write the rules
 
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
and they're going through the process
 
00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:36.320 align:start position:0%
right now and it's a pretty good synergy
 
00:09:38.389 --> 00:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
of how they uh how they are doing it
 
00:09:38.399 --> 00:09:39.590 align:start position:0%
of how they uh how they are doing it
because

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:42.320 align:start position:0%
we're plumbers not lawyers and we have
 
00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:44.320 align:start position:0%
ideas and
 
00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
they they
 
00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
they do the spelling check and
 
00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
the commas and periods and everything
 
00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
else like that so
 
00:09:56.389 --> 00:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
um the association is in favor of 313
 
00:09:57.990 --> 00:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
and we'll be
 
00:09:59.590 --> 00:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
want to be very
 
00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
active with the study committee when
 
00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.150 align:start position:0%
active with the study committee when
they

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:05.680 align:start position:0%
talk about the fees with the old plc uh
 
00:10:07.269 --> 00:10:07.279 align:start position:0%
it's our belief that
 
00:10:10.389 --> 00:10:10.399 align:start position:0%
that the board should have um say in
 
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:12.720 align:start position:0%
what fees are
 
00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
being put on to our licensees and so we
 
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for mr tremblay
 
00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:30.720 align:start position:0%
mr trombley what's pfgs it's plumbers
 
00:10:33.509 --> 00:10:33.519 align:start position:0%
fuel gas fitters and hvac
 
00:10:36.069 --> 00:10:36.079 align:start position:0%
so it covers the the mechanical law so
 
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
it's we have about uh last count about
 
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
300 members or so in the state of new
 
00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:46.470 align:start position:0%
300 members or so in the state of new
hampshire

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
jessica i know i'm going to slaughter
 
00:11:08.949 --> 00:11:08.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:11.269 --> 00:11:11.279 align:start position:0%
all right good morning
 
00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
when i hear jessica in a pause i usually
 
00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
know that's my cue so
 
00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:15.990 align:start position:0%
know that's my cue so
um

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:17.509 --> 00:11:17.519 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is jessica
 
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
calipaletis i'm the director for the
 
00:11:21.829 --> 00:11:21.839 align:start position:0%
division of enforcement at oplc and i am
 
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:24.720 align:start position:0%
here on behalf of oplc this morning
 
00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:28.160 align:start position:0%
oplc supports sb 313 as amended and its
 
00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:29.750 align:start position:0%
oplc supports sb 313 as amended and its
objectives

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
objectives
 
00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
the one thing we would note which i
 
00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:33.200 align:start position:0%
think you've already heard is
 
00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
that the amendment reincorporated the
 
00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
language requiring the mechanical
 
00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
licensing board fees to be deposited in
 
00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
the general fund
 
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
and if passed this would effectively
 
00:11:44.069 --> 00:11:44.079 align:start position:0%
eliminate the board's ability to fund
 
00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
itself through its licensure fees uh so
 
00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
oplc would propose modifying this
 
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:50.720 align:start position:0%
language to make it clear that these
 
00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
funds are to be posited in the oplc fund
 
00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
uh the executive director lindsey
 
00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
courtney had provided a letter to the
 
00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:58.629 align:start position:0%
courtney had provided a letter to the
committee

00:11:58.629 --> 00:11:58.639 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:12:00.389 --> 00:12:00.399 align:start position:0%
that provided additional details on our
 
00:12:00.399 --> 00:12:01.829 align:start position:0%
that provided additional details on our
position

00:12:01.829 --> 00:12:01.839 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
but i'd be happy to answer any questions
 
00:12:12.629 --> 00:12:12.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:15.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:17.200 align:start position:0%
are there any members of the public
 
00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:28.389 --> 00:12:28.399 align:start position:0%
i'll get a pink card for you when i'm
 
00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
done um so
 
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
just for the
 
00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
public's edification to some degree and
 
00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:37.600 align:start position:0%
for also for those members of the
 
00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:39.200 align:start position:0%
committee who are so
 
00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
somewhat newer than some of the some of
 
00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
us who have been here for a while um the
 
00:12:46.389 --> 00:12:46.399 align:start position:0%
idea of
 
00:12:50.069 --> 00:12:50.079 align:start position:0%
this bill is in uh pursuit of
 
00:12:50.079 --> 00:12:51.350 align:start position:0%
this bill is in uh pursuit of
the

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:12:53.509 --> 00:12:53.519 align:start position:0%
perfection if you will of
 
00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
the oplc which uh which the committee
 
00:12:59.509 --> 00:12:59.519 align:start position:0%
will have heard in some of our earlier
 
00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
pursue the idea of
 
00:13:09.269 --> 00:13:09.279 align:start position:0%
having the
 
00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
administrators on the one side and the
 
00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
practitioners on the other side
 
00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:15.910 align:start position:0%
practitioners on the other side
be

00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:18.160 align:start position:0%
be focused on their
 
00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:21.519 align:start position:0%
specialties namely the the professionals
 
00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:24.160 align:start position:0%
who uh who are the practitioners of
 
00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
whatever the profession is
 
00:13:29.509 --> 00:13:29.519 align:start position:0%
uh should do that which they know best
 
00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:31.279 align:start position:0%
which is to
 
00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
to work on
 
00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:33.670 align:start position:0%
to work on
um

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:33.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
making sure the board works for the
 
00:13:37.509 --> 00:13:37.519 align:start position:0%
benefit of the public but also the
 
00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:40.720 align:start position:0%
profession whereas the administrators
 
00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
will focus on the things that that they
 
00:13:46.389 --> 00:13:46.399 align:start position:0%
are most experienced at administration
 
00:13:49.509 --> 00:13:49.519 align:start position:0%
the law and so forth and so on um
 
00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
that is something that is an ongoing
 
00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
process with oplc because it is a
 
00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
relatively new board uh and and those of
 
00:13:59.670 --> 00:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
us who've been here for a while have
 
00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
been aware of the fact that there have
 
00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:02.870 align:start position:0%
been aware of the fact that there have
been

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:14:03.829 --> 00:14:03.839 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
levels of imperfection with regard to
 
00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
the initial design of oplc
 
00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:10.710 align:start position:0%
the initial design of oplc
and

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:10.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:14:12.389 --> 00:14:12.399 align:start position:0%
and that has led to
 
00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
a fair amount of dissatisfaction among
 
00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
the practitioners
 
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
members of the boards but also some
 
00:14:20.389 --> 00:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
members of the public that
 
00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:22.240 align:start position:0%
that felt that this
 
00:14:24.629 --> 00:14:24.639 align:start position:0%
situation doesn't work
 
00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
all that well
 
00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
and should be
 
00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:29.030 align:start position:0%
and should be
improved

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
improved
 
00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
so that's one of the purposes of this
 
00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
bill is to set up the committee to study
 
00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
and make recommendations relative to
 
00:14:38.949 --> 00:14:38.959 align:start position:0%
funding of the office of professional
 
00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:41.680 align:start position:0%
licensure and certification as it states
 
00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
in the analysis
 
00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
so that's why the bill is important
 
00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
among other things that the chair has
 
00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
already spoken to so i just want to
 
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.189 align:start position:0%
already spoken to so i just want to
endorse

00:14:53.189 --> 00:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
endorse
 
00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
you see i'm on the bill so
 
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:56.949 align:start position:0%
you see i'm on the bill so
to

00:14:56.949 --> 00:14:56.959 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:14:58.710 --> 00:14:58.720 align:start position:0%
also let the public know that we are
 
00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:02.720 align:start position:0%
working to make the oplc work as well as
 
00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
possibly can for the
 
00:15:07.269 --> 00:15:07.279 align:start position:0%
boards it administers and also in the
 
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
interest of serving the public so that's
 
00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
the idea thank you thank you
 
00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
representative are there any questions
 
00:15:16.629 --> 00:15:16.639 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt
 
00:15:18.949 --> 00:15:18.959 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:20.240 align:start position:0%
are there any other members from the
 
00:15:23.189 --> 00:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
public that wish to testify
 
00:15:27.509 --> 00:15:27.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
on a purely
 
00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
technical note i told senator gaida we
 
00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:34.240 align:start position:0%
would recess the hearing until he shows
 
00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:35.030 align:start position:0%
would recess the hearing until he shows
up

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
so plea don't close it just recess it
 
00:15:42.629 --> 00:15:42.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
seeing no other members i will go into
 
00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
recess for house bill
 
00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:05.430 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
this will need some combing and
 
00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
a more substantial amendment than i had
 
00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:12.150 align:start position:0%
a more substantial amendment than i had
provided

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:12.160 align:start position:0%
provided
 
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to be
 
00:16:16.389 --> 00:16:16.399 align:start position:0%
working on such an amendment
 
00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
and i would
 
00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
welcome any any committee member to
 
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
point out sections that need need
 
00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:48.560 --> 00:46:09.030 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:09.040 align:start position:0%

uh
 
00:46:36.950 --> 00:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
certain members of the retirement system
 
00:46:39.829 --> 00:46:39.839 align:start position:0%
to purchase non-qualified service time
 
00:46:42.230 --> 00:46:42.240 align:start position:0%

reduce certain
 
00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
provisions and requirements for
 
00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:48.400 align:start position:0%

00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:50.880 align:start position:0%

00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
followed this through the senate jim
 
00:46:55.510 --> 00:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
demers speak to the amended version and

uh
 
00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
how it will go as well as i see marty
 
00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
collin here too but i think jim demers
 
00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:06.880 align:start position:0%
would be the appropriate person to have
 
00:47:08.790 --> 00:47:08.800 align:start position:0%
up next seeing senator
 
00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
de angel hasn't arrived yet
 
00:47:13.829 --> 00:47:13.839 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you
 
00:47:16.069 --> 00:47:16.079 align:start position:0%
find mr jamers if you would fill out a
 
00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
pink card since we're hoping somebody
 
00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
will be able to explain to us why this
 
00:47:27.589 --> 00:47:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:29.270 --> 00:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman and i i will
 
00:47:31.270 --> 00:47:31.280 align:start position:0%
fail out of card i wasn't actually
 
00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
planning on speaking but
 
00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:34.400 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to
 
00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
um so i'm here today on behalf of two
 
00:47:38.790 --> 00:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
groups the new hampshire police
 
00:47:40.309 --> 00:47:40.319 align:start position:0%
association and the new hampshire
 
00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
troopers association
 
00:47:44.069 --> 00:47:44.079 align:start position:0%
so you're going to hear from both
 
00:47:46.150 --> 00:47:46.160 align:start position:0%
organizations after me
 
00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:47.270 align:start position:0%
organizations after me
on

00:47:47.270 --> 00:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:47:49.349 --> 00:47:49.359 align:start position:0%
why this bill was introduced so i will
 
00:47:51.990 --> 00:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
just sort of touch on what the senate
 
00:47:55.589 --> 00:47:55.599 align:start position:0%
did to the bill so that you understand
 
00:47:58.790 --> 00:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
what the bill actually does so this bill
 
00:48:01.349 --> 00:48:01.359 align:start position:0%
is written so that it only applies to
 
00:48:03.109 --> 00:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
the middle tier
 
00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
group two
 
00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
employees so if
 
00:48:09.829 --> 00:48:09.839 align:start position:0%
you remember 11 years ago
 
00:48:12.630 --> 00:48:12.640 align:start position:0%
there was a major reform of the
 
00:48:14.549 --> 00:48:14.559 align:start position:0%
retirement system
 
00:48:16.790 --> 00:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
and we ended up with a
 
00:48:19.910 --> 00:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
three tiers of employees so there was
 
00:48:21.510 --> 00:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
one group that had been in the system
 
00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:22.640 align:start position:0%
long enough
 
00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
they stayed at a 20-year retirement
 
00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:26.710 align:start position:0%
they stayed at a 20-year retirement
period

00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:26.720 align:start position:0%
period
 
00:48:30.309 --> 00:48:30.319 align:start position:0%
and new hires in group one
 
00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
ended up with a 25-year retirement
 
00:48:36.549 --> 00:48:36.559 align:start position:0%
period the middle tier is a group of
 
00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh employees who
 
00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:40.720 align:start position:0%
were hired with the understanding it
 
00:48:43.109 --> 00:48:43.119 align:start position:0%
would be 20 years but it was increased
 
00:48:45.829 --> 00:48:45.839 align:start position:0%
and it's a sliding scale so they
 
00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:48.880 align:start position:0%
went from 20 years to anywhere from
 
00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
21 years to 25 years
 
00:48:54.710 --> 00:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
in order to to retire so this deals with
 
00:48:56.790 --> 00:48:56.800 align:start position:0%
that middle tier group
 
00:48:58.870 --> 00:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
that were hired
 
00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
with an understanding it would be 20 but
 
00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
it was increased to some number between
 
00:49:07.829 --> 00:49:07.839 align:start position:0%
21 and 25. so the bill before you
 
00:49:11.190 --> 00:49:11.200 align:start position:0%
allows for that middle tier employees to
 
00:49:14.470 --> 00:49:14.480 align:start position:0%
be able to purchase years above the
 
00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
20-year period to get
 
00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
down to the 20-year period so let me
 
00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
give you an example if they were hired
 
00:49:24.069 --> 00:49:24.079 align:start position:0%
20 years
 
00:49:28.150 --> 00:49:28.160 align:start position:0%
but the system changed them to 25 years
 
00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:30.640 align:start position:0%
this bill allows them to purchase and
 
00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
pay the entire expense
 
00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
of those additional five years
 
00:49:37.990 --> 00:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh to get back down to the 20 years that
 
00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
they were hired under
 
00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:40.710 align:start position:0%
they were hired under
um

00:49:40.710 --> 00:49:40.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:41.750 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:49:43.910 --> 00:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
there's there is a feeling that one of
 
00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:45.680 align:start position:0%
the things that this bill will do will
 
00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:46.470 align:start position:0%
the things that this bill will do will
help

00:49:46.470 --> 00:49:46.480 align:start position:0%
help
 
00:49:49.109 --> 00:49:49.119 align:start position:0%
retain some of the employees
 
00:49:52.150 --> 00:49:52.160 align:start position:0%
uh who have been leaving early and and
 
00:49:53.750 --> 00:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
you'll hear from one of the people who
 
00:49:55.910 --> 00:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
would testify behind me that we're
 
00:49:57.910 --> 00:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
seeing an unusual trend right now as
 
00:50:00.790 --> 00:50:00.800 align:start position:0%
you've heard this year
 
00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:01.589 align:start position:0%
you've heard this year
in

00:50:01.589 --> 00:50:01.599 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
group two and that is
 
00:50:06.309 --> 00:50:06.319 align:start position:0%
there are people who are actually
 
00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
leaving before they even hit the 20 or
 
00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
25 years
 
00:50:12.790 --> 00:50:12.800 align:start position:0%
and it's creating a real retention
 
00:50:15.829 --> 00:50:15.839 align:start position:0%
problem in the area of public safety
 
00:50:15.839 --> 00:50:16.710 align:start position:0%
problem in the area of public safety
so

00:50:16.710 --> 00:50:16.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
the feeling is that by giving
 
00:50:20.950 --> 00:50:20.960 align:start position:0%
some of these individuals if they can
 
00:50:23.670 --> 00:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
afford it the opportunity to buy down to
 
00:50:25.109 --> 00:50:25.119 align:start position:0%
the 20 years
 
00:50:28.069 --> 00:50:28.079 align:start position:0%
they may stay and do the 20 years that
 
00:50:29.670 --> 00:50:29.680 align:start position:0%
we want
 
00:50:31.349 --> 00:50:31.359 align:start position:0%
so that's one of the reasons that this
 
00:50:33.349 --> 00:50:33.359 align:start position:0%
bill exists
 
00:50:35.190 --> 00:50:35.200 align:start position:0%
and when the senate
 
00:50:37.829 --> 00:50:37.839 align:start position:0%
when the original version was introduced
 
00:50:39.190 --> 00:50:39.200 align:start position:0%
it had
 
00:50:43.030 --> 00:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
two costs to the governments in this uh
 
00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
in this section so there was a the
 
00:50:46.950 --> 00:50:46.960 align:start position:0%
fiscal note projected that there would
 
00:50:49.109 --> 00:50:49.119 align:start position:0%
be a two hundred and ten thousand dollar
 
00:50:51.109 --> 00:50:51.119 align:start position:0%
cost to local governments
 
00:50:55.109 --> 00:50:55.119 align:start position:0%
and a thirty thousand dollar cost to
 
00:50:56.790 --> 00:50:56.800 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:50:58.870 --> 00:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
when the senate finance committee worked
 
00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
on this bill they amended it so that the
 
00:51:03.510 --> 00:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
language requires the individual would
 
00:51:06.069 --> 00:51:06.079 align:start position:0%
have to pick up 100 percent of the cost
 
00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
so there is no longer a cost
 
00:51:10.230 --> 00:51:10.240 align:start position:0%
to the local governments or state
 
00:51:11.910 --> 00:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
government in the spill
 
00:51:15.510 --> 00:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
so the actuary when they figure out what
 
00:51:17.910 --> 00:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
the years would cost the individual they
 
00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
will factor in
 
00:51:21.589 --> 00:51:21.599 align:start position:0%
the individual's expense and the
 
00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
government's expense and the individual
 
00:51:26.069 --> 00:51:26.079 align:start position:0%
pays one hundred percent of that so this
 
00:51:28.309 --> 00:51:28.319 align:start position:0%
bill has no cost to
 
00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
uh the state or local governments
 
00:51:34.390 --> 00:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
and it is hard to you know estimate how
 
00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
many may take advantage of this but we
 
00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:38.640 align:start position:0%
do believe it's
 
00:51:40.549 --> 00:51:40.559 align:start position:0%
really going to be small and i will tell
 
00:51:42.549 --> 00:51:42.559 align:start position:0%
you the reason is because
 
00:51:46.150 --> 00:51:46.160 align:start position:0%
it's potentially 40 or 45 000
 
00:51:47.589 --> 00:51:47.599 align:start position:0%
a year
 
00:51:50.309 --> 00:51:50.319 align:start position:0%
to buy down so you can imagine that's
 
00:51:52.150 --> 00:51:52.160 align:start position:0%
going to be a fairly small
 
00:51:54.470 --> 00:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
number of people who have that kind of
 
00:51:56.630 --> 00:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
financial resources to take advantage of
 
00:51:58.470 --> 00:51:58.480 align:start position:0%
this so
 
00:52:00.710 --> 00:52:00.720 align:start position:0%
we think it's a good bill we think
 
00:52:01.990 --> 00:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
it will help
 
00:52:03.990 --> 00:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
get some of our employees to stay for
 
00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
their 20 years and will help deal with
 
00:52:08.790 --> 00:52:08.800 align:start position:0%
the retention problem that the state
 
00:52:10.390 --> 00:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
is facing
 
00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:11.190 align:start position:0%
is facing
and

00:52:11.190 --> 00:52:11.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:52:12.950 --> 00:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
there are people behind me from the two
 
00:52:15.990 --> 00:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
organizations who would like to speak to
 
00:52:18.390 --> 00:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
this if they may and i
 
00:52:21.270 --> 00:52:21.280 align:start position:0%
believe did senator d'alessandro walk in
 
00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:22.150 align:start position:0%
believe did senator d'alessandro walk in
okay

00:52:22.150 --> 00:52:22.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
yes and senator alessandro i think can
 
00:52:26.390 --> 00:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
speak to what senate finance did with
 
00:52:28.630 --> 00:52:28.640 align:start position:0%
this bill as well thank you are there
 
00:52:31.990 --> 00:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
representative grota has a question
 
00:52:32.950 --> 00:52:32.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:52:35.829 --> 00:52:35.839 align:start position:0%
mr demers can you um
 
00:52:38.309 --> 00:52:38.319 align:start position:0%
help me understand how
 
00:52:38.319 --> 00:52:39.349 align:start position:0%
help me understand how
this

00:52:39.349 --> 00:52:39.359 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:52:41.670 --> 00:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
would retain employees because it seems
 
00:52:44.309 --> 00:52:44.319 align:start position:0%
like it's a lot of money
 
00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
forty forty five 000 a year so
 
00:52:51.190 --> 00:52:51.200 align:start position:0%
why would if someone's going to
 
00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
why would this prevent someone from
 
00:52:54.790 --> 00:52:54.800 align:start position:0%
leaving early
 
00:52:59.270 --> 00:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
so um if a person has let's say
 
00:53:01.030 --> 00:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
15 years
 
00:53:02.549 --> 00:53:02.559 align:start position:0%
in the system
 
00:53:04.069 --> 00:53:04.079 align:start position:0%
uh that means they've got still
 
00:53:06.069 --> 00:53:06.079 align:start position:0%
potentially another 10 years that they
 
00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
have to put in and we are actually
 
00:53:11.589 --> 00:53:11.599 align:start position:0%
seeing people that are are leaving
 
00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
so if they know they can buy back five
 
00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:15.430 align:start position:0%
so if they know they can buy back five
years

00:53:15.430 --> 00:53:15.440 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
so they only will have to do another
 
00:53:19.109 --> 00:53:19.119 align:start position:0%
five years
 
00:53:20.710 --> 00:53:20.720 align:start position:0%
and it gets them to the 20 years that
 
00:53:22.870 --> 00:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
they were actually hired under we think
 
00:53:24.870 --> 00:53:24.880 align:start position:0%
there are some that would take advantage
 
00:53:26.790 --> 00:53:26.800 align:start position:0%
of that and stay for the 20 years rather
 
00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
than leave there are also advantages to
 
00:53:33.589 --> 00:53:33.599 align:start position:0%
retiring as a full-service employee
 
00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
rather than retiring and having a vested
 
00:53:40.710 --> 00:53:40.720 align:start position:0%
benefit that you'll get when you
 
00:53:43.030 --> 00:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
at a later date if nothing else the
 
00:53:45.670 --> 00:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
survivor benefit requires you to retire
 
00:53:46.710 --> 00:53:46.720 align:start position:0%
from a
 
00:53:51.190 --> 00:53:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:52.790 --> 00:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
are there other questions representative
 
00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:53.829 align:start position:0%
are there other questions representative
fellows

00:53:53.829 --> 00:53:53.839 align:start position:0%
fellows
 
00:53:56.950 --> 00:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um the estimate
 
00:53:58.870 --> 00:53:58.880 align:start position:0%
for the cost that you
 
00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
the estimate for the cost that you
 
00:54:02.630 --> 00:54:02.640 align:start position:0%
stated 40 to 45
 
00:54:04.470 --> 00:54:04.480 align:start position:0%
000 are how
 
00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
how many are they they're buying years
 
00:54:10.309 --> 00:54:10.319 align:start position:0%
essentially to be added so how many
 
00:54:10.319 --> 00:54:11.670 align:start position:0%
essentially to be added so how many
years

00:54:11.670 --> 00:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
is that equal to and
 
00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
can people buy like half that amount
 
00:54:19.270 --> 00:54:19.280 align:start position:0%
yes so
 
00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:20.150 align:start position:0%
yes so
um

00:54:20.150 --> 00:54:20.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:22.870 --> 00:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
the ballpark number of 40 or 45 thousand
 
00:54:26.309 --> 00:54:26.319 align:start position:0%
000 as i understand it is a per year
 
00:54:26.319 --> 00:54:27.190 align:start position:0%
000 as i understand it is a per year
cost

00:54:27.190 --> 00:54:27.200 align:start position:0%
cost
 
00:54:29.270 --> 00:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
so if somebody were to purchase five
 
00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:30.470 align:start position:0%
so if somebody were to purchase five
years

00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:54:33.190 --> 00:54:33.200 align:start position:0%
they have to they would spend 200 and
 
00:54:35.190 --> 00:54:35.200 align:start position:0%
some odd thousand dollars in order to do
 
00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:36.309 align:start position:0%
some odd thousand dollars in order to do
that

00:54:36.309 --> 00:54:36.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
if they have five years above the 20
 
00:54:40.069 --> 00:54:40.079 align:start position:0%
they could buy one
 
00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
they could buy two they could buy any
 
00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
amount that gets them lower but they
 
00:54:46.390 --> 00:54:46.400 align:start position:0%
can't go below the 20 that they were
 
00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
hired under
 
00:54:50.549 --> 00:54:50.559 align:start position:0%
so if they had 45 000 and they want to
 
00:54:54.069 --> 00:54:54.079 align:start position:0%
buy one year they could lower it to 24
 
00:54:55.430 --> 00:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
years or
 
00:54:58.870 --> 00:54:58.880 align:start position:0%
if they're in that sliding scale and
 
00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
they are
 
00:55:02.870 --> 00:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
they went from 20 to 21 years they could
 
00:55:05.349 --> 00:55:05.359 align:start position:0%
buy one year to get them to their 20
 
00:55:06.950 --> 00:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
years so
 
00:55:08.789 --> 00:55:08.799 align:start position:0%
obviously it's a different decision for
 
00:55:10.789 --> 00:55:10.799 align:start position:0%
every individual that has to make this
 
00:55:13.030 --> 00:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
but if someone were to buy all five
 
00:55:14.630 --> 00:55:14.640 align:start position:0%
years it's going to be
 
00:55:16.630 --> 00:55:16.640 align:start position:0%
a significant cost
 
00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:17.990 align:start position:0%
a significant cost
follow-up

00:55:17.990 --> 00:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:18.950 align:start position:0%
follow-up
um

00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:19.750 align:start position:0%
um
my

00:55:19.750 --> 00:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:55:22.309 --> 00:55:22.319 align:start position:0%
i'm a retired state employee
 
00:55:24.789 --> 00:55:24.799 align:start position:0%
so my recollection is maybe
 
00:55:28.630 --> 00:55:28.640 align:start position:0%
15 years ago maybe it was even 20 at one
 
00:55:32.150 --> 00:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
time group one people could buy
 
00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:33.190 align:start position:0%
time group one people could buy
extra

00:55:33.190 --> 00:55:33.200 align:start position:0%
extra
 
00:55:36.390 --> 00:55:36.400 align:start position:0%
years is this the equivalent of that do
 
00:55:37.670 --> 00:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:55:39.349 --> 00:55:39.359 align:start position:0%
so i do remember there was a period i
 
00:55:41.589 --> 00:55:41.599 align:start position:0%
don't know if it was quite that long ago
 
00:55:43.990 --> 00:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
where we opened up a window so that
 
00:55:45.990 --> 00:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
people could buy down years
 
00:55:47.589 --> 00:55:47.599 align:start position:0%
uh this is
 
00:55:49.270 --> 00:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
significantly different
 
00:55:50.950 --> 00:55:50.960 align:start position:0%
uh because that was an
 
00:55:52.950 --> 00:55:52.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity for i think almost everybody
 
00:55:56.230 --> 00:55:56.240 align:start position:0%
in the system this is just aimed at that
 
00:55:58.309 --> 00:55:58.319 align:start position:0%
middle tier group two
 
00:56:01.030 --> 00:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
that has this unique situation where
 
00:56:03.510 --> 00:56:03.520 align:start position:0%
they were you know they were hired
 
00:56:06.710 --> 00:56:06.720 align:start position:0%
with one assumption but it changed uh
 
00:56:09.589 --> 00:56:09.599 align:start position:0%
when the reforms went through
 
00:56:13.109 --> 00:56:13.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:15.190 --> 00:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
yes the mechanism is the same that they
 
00:56:18.069 --> 00:56:18.079 align:start position:0%
will have to come up get a calculation
 
00:56:20.390 --> 00:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
and pony up a lot of money yes that is
 
00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:22.789 align:start position:0%
and pony up a lot of money yes that is
true

00:56:22.789 --> 00:56:22.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:25.589 --> 00:56:25.599 align:start position:0%
okay representative schmidt
 
00:56:27.990 --> 00:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so i think your
 
00:56:30.230 --> 00:56:30.240 align:start position:0%
last remark kind of clarifies my
 
00:56:32.069 --> 00:56:32.079 align:start position:0%
understanding so we're talking about
 
00:56:33.829 --> 00:56:33.839 align:start position:0%
somebody would have to they're talking
 
00:56:36.230 --> 00:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
about five years at the pony up
 
00:56:38.789 --> 00:56:38.799 align:start position:0%
five times 40
 
00:56:42.150 --> 00:56:42.160 align:start position:0%
20 000 bucks on the barrel head
 
00:56:45.990 --> 00:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:48.309 --> 00:56:48.319 align:start position:0%
that that's a good question i might
 
00:56:50.309 --> 00:56:50.319 align:start position:0%
might have to defer to the retirement
 
00:56:52.150 --> 00:56:52.160 align:start position:0%
system to see if that opportunity a lot
 
00:56:54.150 --> 00:56:54.160 align:start position:0%
of heads nodding back there with regard
 
00:56:57.270 --> 00:56:57.280 align:start position:0%
to some of your earlier statements
 
00:56:59.349 --> 00:56:59.359 align:start position:0%
nodding in agreement
 
00:57:01.510 --> 00:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
i think some somebody can answer my
 
00:57:03.270 --> 00:57:03.280 align:start position:0%
question if you can't okay yeah i think
 
00:57:04.549 --> 00:57:04.559 align:start position:0%
that would be good if i could hold that
 
00:57:06.069 --> 00:57:06.079 align:start position:0%
one for someone else
 
00:57:07.349 --> 00:57:07.359 align:start position:0%
all right thank you are there other
 
00:57:07.359 --> 00:57:09.030 align:start position:0%
all right thank you are there other
questions

00:57:09.030 --> 00:57:09.040 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:57:10.630 --> 00:57:10.640 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
00:57:12.950 --> 00:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
you excuse me tech
 
00:57:15.750 --> 00:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
you you talked about buying down isn't
 
00:57:19.270 --> 00:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
this buying up if somebody's at 18 to
 
00:57:21.589 --> 00:57:21.599 align:start position:0%
that they buy two to buy either way up
 
00:57:24.630 --> 00:57:24.640 align:start position:0%
to 20. i don't understand no if they're
 
00:57:27.270 --> 00:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
they're actually buying down from
 
00:57:29.190 --> 00:57:29.200 align:start position:0%
let me use an example i think it's the
 
00:57:31.589 --> 00:57:31.599 align:start position:0%
best way to do it so if
 
00:57:31.599 --> 00:57:33.109 align:start position:0%
best way to do it so if
they

00:57:33.109 --> 00:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:57:36.549 --> 00:57:36.559 align:start position:0%
are now required to have 25 years to
 
00:57:39.109 --> 00:57:39.119 align:start position:0%
retire this gives them the ability to
 
00:57:43.109 --> 00:57:43.119 align:start position:0%
buy down to get toward the 20-year
 
00:57:43.119 --> 00:57:44.549 align:start position:0%
buy down to get toward the 20-year
uh

00:57:44.549 --> 00:57:44.559 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:57:46.549 --> 00:57:46.559 align:start position:0%
number that they were hired under so
 
00:57:47.670 --> 00:57:47.680 align:start position:0%
it's act
 
00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
i guess there's two ways to look at it
 
00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:50.470 align:start position:0%
i guess there's two ways to look at it
but

00:57:50.470 --> 00:57:50.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:57:53.430 --> 00:57:53.440 align:start position:0%
i i see it as buying down to get to the
 
00:57:55.670 --> 00:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
20 years that they were hired under
 
00:57:55.680 --> 00:57:56.549 align:start position:0%
20 years that they were hired under
or

00:57:56.549 --> 00:57:56.559 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:57:59.829 --> 00:57:59.839 align:start position:0%
and the glass is half full i'm sure
 
00:58:02.870 --> 00:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
other questions represent yes follow-up
 
00:58:05.109 --> 00:58:05.119 align:start position:0%
i i might just say that i know somebody
 
00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
that took advantage of that group one
 
00:58:09.860 --> 00:58:09.870 align:start position:0%
buyout it was wonderful it was just
 
00:58:09.870 --> 00:58:12.470 align:start position:0%
buyout it was wonderful it was just
[Laughter]

00:58:12.470 --> 00:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:58:15.190 --> 00:58:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:17.430 --> 00:58:17.440 align:start position:0%

sorry we started without you but it
 
00:58:23.589 --> 00:58:23.599 align:start position:0%
looked like there was more interest than
 
00:58:25.510 --> 00:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
i had thought on this
 
00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
well you have a lot of a lot of interest
 
00:58:28.789 --> 00:58:28.799 align:start position:0%

lateness i was had another meeting and

i come before you as the prime sponsor
 
00:58:54.630 --> 00:58:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:57.109 --> 00:58:57.119 align:start position:0%
i'm here today to introduce or to to
 
00:58:59.670 --> 00:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
bring to your attention senate bill 363
 
00:59:02.470 --> 00:59:02.480 align:start position:0%
as amended by the senate
 
00:59:04.630 --> 00:59:04.640 align:start position:0%
a bill would would allow group two
 
00:59:06.789 --> 00:59:06.799 align:start position:0%
employees who are in the middle tier
 
00:59:09.349 --> 00:59:09.359 align:start position:0%
category of the retirement system
 
00:59:11.109 --> 00:59:11.119 align:start position:0%
to purchase years
 
00:59:12.870 --> 00:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
to get them back to the 20-year
 
00:59:14.950 --> 00:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
retirement trigger that they had when
 
00:59:16.630 --> 00:59:16.640 align:start position:0%
they were hired
 
00:59:19.349 --> 00:59:19.359 align:start position:0%
we adjusted the retirement system now
 
00:59:21.829 --> 00:59:21.839 align:start position:0%
you may recall when changes were made to
 
00:59:23.910 --> 00:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
the state retirement program about 11
 
00:59:25.589 --> 00:59:25.599 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
00:59:28.230 --> 00:59:28.240 align:start position:0%
the legislature enacted three tiers of
 
00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:29.589 align:start position:0%
the legislature enacted three tiers of
employees

00:59:29.589 --> 00:59:29.599 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:59:31.510 --> 00:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
the first tier is employees who could
 
00:59:33.910 --> 00:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
retire after 20 years
 
00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
another tier was the new hires
 
00:59:39.990 --> 00:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
which had a 25-year retirement and then
 
00:59:42.309 --> 00:59:42.319 align:start position:0%
there was the middle tier which includes
 
00:59:43.910 --> 00:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
employees who were hired with the
 
00:59:43.920 --> 00:59:45.270 align:start position:0%
employees who were hired with the
understanding

00:59:45.270 --> 00:59:45.280 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
00:59:47.990 --> 00:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
that there was a 20-year retirement but
 
00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
it was increased on a sliding scale
 
00:59:54.390 --> 00:59:54.400 align:start position:0%
from somewhere between 20 and 25 years
 
00:59:57.829 --> 00:59:57.839 align:start position:0%
sp 363 deals solely with that middle
 
00:59:57.839 --> 00:59:58.829 align:start position:0%
sp 363 deals solely with that middle
tier

00:59:58.829 --> 00:59:58.839 align:start position:0%
tier
 
01:00:01.750 --> 01:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
group as we all know
 
01:00:03.990 --> 01:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
retention of our state and local law
 
01:00:06.309 --> 01:00:06.319 align:start position:0%
enforcement personnel has become a
 
01:00:08.710 --> 01:00:08.720 align:start position:0%
serious challenge
 
01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
i indicate that to you in this in this
 
01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:12.230 align:start position:0%
i indicate that to you in this in this
sense

01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
sense
 
01:00:14.630 --> 01:00:14.640 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire has 2 000
 
01:00:17.270 --> 01:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
vacancies as we speak
 
01:00:20.069 --> 01:00:20.079 align:start position:0%
people are retiring in droves
 
01:00:22.950 --> 01:00:22.960 align:start position:0%
and we are not able to replace them
 
01:00:25.589 --> 01:00:25.599 align:start position:0%
that's a serious challenge
 
01:00:28.950 --> 01:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
at the present time i believe we have 60
 
01:00:31.510 --> 01:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
vacancies at state police
 
01:00:34.309 --> 01:00:34.319 align:start position:0%
six zero vacancies
 
01:00:36.950 --> 01:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
recruitment of new hires is extremely
 
01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:38.950 align:start position:0%
recruitment of new hires is extremely
problematic

01:00:38.950 --> 01:00:38.960 align:start position:0%
problematic
 
01:00:41.109 --> 01:00:41.119 align:start position:0%
which is placing added pressure on
 
01:00:43.829 --> 01:00:43.839 align:start position:0%
retaining the men and women currently in
 
01:00:45.510 --> 01:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
those jobs
 
01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
pressure from the private sector
 
01:00:50.390 --> 01:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
and in some cases outright burnout is
 
01:00:52.789 --> 01:00:52.799 align:start position:0%
taking its toll i'm sure you all read
 
01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
the article in the rag today
 
01:00:57.030 --> 01:00:57.040 align:start position:0%
about the nurses
 
01:01:00.309 --> 01:01:00.319 align:start position:0%
whose jobs we can't fill
 
01:01:02.069 --> 01:01:02.079 align:start position:0%
i talked with the superintendent of new
 
01:01:04.309 --> 01:01:04.319 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital if we could fill
 
01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
every vacancy that we have at new
 
01:01:08.950 --> 01:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital we would have no
 
01:01:10.950 --> 01:01:10.960 align:start position:0%
waiting list
 
01:01:12.630 --> 01:01:12.640 align:start position:0%
i'm sure all of you look at the waiting
 
01:01:15.829 --> 01:01:15.839 align:start position:0%
list every day for adults and youngsters
 
01:01:17.349 --> 01:01:17.359 align:start position:0%
it's long
 
01:01:18.870 --> 01:01:18.880 align:start position:0%
think of it as it relates to the
 
01:01:21.430 --> 01:01:21.440 align:start position:0%
retirement situation yes thank you
 
01:01:22.789 --> 01:01:22.799 align:start position:0%
if you could concentrate on this
 
01:01:24.870 --> 01:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
particular bill i will concentrate on
 
01:01:28.549 --> 01:01:28.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
employees are leaving well before their
 
01:01:33.270 --> 01:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
25-year retirement trigger
 
01:01:35.990 --> 01:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
senate bill 363 is designed to help
 
01:01:39.190 --> 01:01:39.200 align:start position:0%
retain those employees who were bumped
 
01:01:41.829 --> 01:01:41.839 align:start position:0%
from the 20 to 25 years by giving them
 
01:01:44.390 --> 01:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to purchase years over
 
01:01:47.030 --> 01:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
the 20-year period to get them back to
 
01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:48.150 align:start position:0%
the 20-year period to get them back to
20.

01:01:48.150 --> 01:01:48.160 align:start position:0%
20.
 
01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
this is not a bill for everyone
 
01:01:52.789 --> 01:01:52.799 align:start position:0%
because the employees need to purchase
 
01:01:55.430 --> 01:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
those additional years with their own
 
01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:56.710 align:start position:0%
those additional years with their own
money

01:01:56.710 --> 01:01:56.720 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:01:58.710 --> 01:01:58.720 align:start position:0%
make that perfectly clear
 
01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
there's no state or local money involved
 
01:02:03.029 --> 01:02:03.039 align:start position:0%
in this our amendments at the state
 
01:02:05.910 --> 01:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
level clearly indicate that all of the
 
01:02:09.109 --> 01:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
money must come from the individual
 
01:02:11.109 --> 01:02:11.119 align:start position:0%
because the employee needs to purchase
 
01:02:12.710 --> 01:02:12.720 align:start position:0%
those additional leaders with their own
 
01:02:14.870 --> 01:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
money it's costly
 
01:02:16.390 --> 01:02:16.400 align:start position:0%
but there are some who would take
 
01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:18.640 align:start position:0%
advantage of it thereby keeping them on
 
01:02:21.270 --> 01:02:21.280 align:start position:0%
the job for the full 20-year period they
 
01:02:23.430 --> 01:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
were originally hired for
 
01:02:25.750 --> 01:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
we're very fortunate in new hampshire to
 
01:02:27.829 --> 01:02:27.839 align:start position:0%
have an outstanding group of state and
 
01:02:30.390 --> 01:02:30.400 align:start position:0%
local law enforcement officers who keep
 
01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
us safe day after day
 
01:02:35.270 --> 01:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
and we have an obligation to maintain
 
01:02:36.549 --> 01:02:36.559 align:start position:0%
and retain
 
01:02:39.670 --> 01:02:39.680 align:start position:0%
this group of dedicated public servants
 
01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
senate bill 363 is a very small step to
 
01:02:45.990 --> 01:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
doing just that for a very limited
 
01:02:49.190 --> 01:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
number of qualifieds qualifications i
 
01:02:50.950 --> 01:02:50.960 align:start position:0%
hope you can join me in supporting the
 
01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:51.829 align:start position:0%
hope you can join me in supporting the
bill

01:02:51.829 --> 01:02:51.839 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:02:54.789 --> 01:02:54.799 align:start position:0%
the bill as amended as i said takes all
 
01:02:57.109 --> 01:02:57.119 align:start position:0%
of the financial responsibility and
 
01:02:59.349 --> 01:02:59.359 align:start position:0%
places it on the individual so there's
 
01:03:02.549 --> 01:03:02.559 align:start position:0%
no cost to the state of no cost to the
 
01:03:05.270 --> 01:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
local municipality with that madam chair
 
01:03:07.990 --> 01:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
i'll conclude my testimony and
 
01:03:09.829 --> 01:03:09.839 align:start position:0%
be happy to address any queries that
 
01:03:10.950 --> 01:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
might be presented thank you
 
01:03:12.950 --> 01:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
representative scitec has one
 
01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:15.029 align:start position:0%
representative scitec has one
yeah

01:03:15.029 --> 01:03:15.039 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:03:16.870 --> 01:03:16.880 align:start position:0%
senator dale cinder you're on senate
 
01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
finance right i am
 
01:03:22.309 --> 01:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
does it strike you as fair your
 
01:03:25.349 --> 01:03:25.359 align:start position:0%
amendment to make the employee pick what
 
01:03:29.349 --> 01:03:29.359 align:start position:0%
up 100 percent let me explain by example
 
01:03:31.190 --> 01:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
yeah i happen to know a salem police
 
01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:32.309 align:start position:0%
yeah i happen to know a salem police
officer

01:03:32.309 --> 01:03:32.319 align:start position:0%
officer
 
01:03:35.029 --> 01:03:35.039 align:start position:0%
let's use scott as a just as out of the
 
01:03:36.390 --> 01:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
blue name
 
01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
who's missed by a few months the 20-year
 
01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
thing are you going to make him pay 100
 
01:03:44.710 --> 01:03:44.720 align:start position:0%
because he missed by a couple of months
 
01:03:46.230 --> 01:03:46.240 align:start position:0%
that just doesn't seem right that
 
01:03:48.630 --> 01:03:48.640 align:start position:0%
there's not some sliding scale that
 
01:03:51.109 --> 01:03:51.119 align:start position:0%
there's some cost sharing it just rubs
 
01:03:53.190 --> 01:03:53.200 align:start position:0%
me the wrong way and i'm asking your
 
01:03:54.870 --> 01:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
opinion on that well i think that's
 
01:03:56.710 --> 01:03:56.720 align:start position:0%
that's a great comment when has it ever
 
01:03:59.190 --> 01:03:59.200 align:start position:0%
been fair representative scitec how we
 
01:04:00.549 --> 01:04:00.559 align:start position:0%
do things here
 
01:04:02.870 --> 01:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
in in the house and in the senate uh
 
01:04:05.109 --> 01:04:05.119 align:start position:0%
when we changed the that when we changed
 
01:04:07.589 --> 01:04:07.599 align:start position:0%
the retirement system was that fair to
 
01:04:10.549 --> 01:04:10.559 align:start position:0%
all of the people who weren't vested
 
01:04:12.789 --> 01:04:12.799 align:start position:0%
did we think about that we were trying
 
01:04:14.789 --> 01:04:14.799 align:start position:0%
to do something to to
 
01:04:17.190 --> 01:04:17.200 align:start position:0%
enhance the viability of the system
 
01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
no no it isn't fair but it's an
 
01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:21.750 align:start position:0%
no no it isn't fair but it's an
opportunity

01:04:21.750 --> 01:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
01:04:24.789 --> 01:04:24.799 align:start position:0%
and the the fairness aspect of it the
 
01:04:27.270 --> 01:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
way this opportunity can get passed is
 
01:04:29.109 --> 01:04:29.119 align:start position:0%
if the individual bears all of the
 
01:04:30.870 --> 01:04:30.880 align:start position:0%
responsibility all of the financial
 
01:04:33.349 --> 01:04:33.359 align:start position:0%
responsibility that's the way that's the
 
01:04:35.109 --> 01:04:35.119 align:start position:0%
way it is
 
01:04:37.190 --> 01:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
and i i think there are there are people
 
01:04:39.190 --> 01:04:39.200 align:start position:0%
sitting in the seats on the senate side
 
01:04:42.710 --> 01:04:42.720 align:start position:0%
as you're sitting here that said
 
01:04:44.789 --> 01:04:44.799 align:start position:0%
for a municipality to pick up any of the
 
01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:46.559 align:start position:0%
money that was unfair for the state to
 
01:04:49.670 --> 01:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
pick up any of the of the uh
 
01:04:52.150 --> 01:04:52.160 align:start position:0%
the financial costs that was not fair so
 
01:04:55.029 --> 01:04:55.039 align:start position:0%
you know fairness is an in is an issue
 
01:04:57.190 --> 01:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
that that should be pervasive i mean we
 
01:04:59.589 --> 01:04:59.599 align:start position:0%
should do everything fairly right i mean
 
01:05:01.910 --> 01:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
shouldn't we be fair in every decision
 
01:05:03.589 --> 01:05:03.599 align:start position:0%
we make
 
01:05:05.349 --> 01:05:05.359 align:start position:0%
but does that happen
 
01:05:05.359 --> 01:05:07.349 align:start position:0%
but does that happen
no

01:05:07.349 --> 01:05:07.359 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:05:08.870 --> 01:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
thank you senator
 
01:05:10.789 --> 01:05:10.799 align:start position:0%
you're welcome representative allegro
 
01:05:13.109 --> 01:05:13.119 align:start position:0%
has a question and representative bailey
 
01:05:14.630 --> 01:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
thank you really this is a comment by
 
01:05:16.870 --> 01:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
way of clarification if i understood the
 
01:05:19.349 --> 01:05:19.359 align:start position:0%
question before it was whether it had to
 
01:05:21.190 --> 01:05:21.200 align:start position:0%
be paid out in a lump sum
 
01:05:24.150 --> 01:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
or if you look at page one lines nine to
 
01:05:26.470 --> 01:05:26.480 align:start position:0%
eleven it can be paid in installments
 
01:05:27.670 --> 01:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
i wanted to get that in while it was
 
01:05:30.950 --> 01:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
still germaine it also allows
 
01:05:34.230 --> 01:05:34.240 align:start position:0%
two requests per year so that a person
 
01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:35.190 align:start position:0%
two requests per year so that a person
could

01:05:35.190 --> 01:05:35.200 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:05:37.910 --> 01:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
you know buy back a month or a year at a
 
01:05:40.150 --> 01:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
time if should they so choose
 
01:05:42.230 --> 01:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
representative bailey thank you madam
 
01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:43.190 align:start position:0%
representative bailey thank you madam
chair

01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:05:45.349 --> 01:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
thank you senator um
 
01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
what does the 45 percent that's not
 
01:05:50.470 --> 01:05:50.480 align:start position:0%
costing anything represent is that like
 
01:05:53.270 --> 01:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
the present value of all the years of
 
01:05:57.589 --> 01:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
retirement or between now and 65 or
 
01:05:58.950 --> 01:05:58.960 align:start position:0%
you say it's not going to cost anything
 
01:06:00.870 --> 01:06:00.880 align:start position:0%
where does it come from
 
01:06:02.470 --> 01:06:02.480 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:06:04.470 --> 01:06:04.480 align:start position:0%
the gentleman from the retirement system
 
01:06:05.829 --> 01:06:05.839 align:start position:0%
is here and i think he could address all
 
01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
of those queries thank you for the
 
01:06:08.710 --> 01:06:08.720 align:start position:0%
question i'm sure you'll be happy to

explicitly to explain me why we have 60
vacancies

01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
vacancies
 
01:06:38.230 --> 01:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a great question
 
01:06:40.630 --> 01:06:40.640 align:start position:0%
representative judy and i think
 
01:06:42.870 --> 01:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
we have 2 000 vacancies in state
 
01:06:44.549 --> 01:06:44.559 align:start position:0%
government why do we have vacancies at
 
01:06:47.430 --> 01:06:47.440 align:start position:0%
state police because we can't recruit
 
01:06:50.150 --> 01:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
and retain that's a serious problem in
 
01:06:52.150 --> 01:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
state government but it's a serious
 
01:06:54.309 --> 01:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
problem throughout the through the
 
01:06:55.589 --> 01:06:55.599 align:start position:0%
the entire
 
01:06:58.470 --> 01:06:58.480 align:start position:0%
employment sector
 
01:07:00.710 --> 01:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
very difficult to find qualified people
 
01:07:02.390 --> 01:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
they have to pass the exam they have to
 
01:07:03.910 --> 01:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
pass the drug test
 
01:07:07.109 --> 01:07:07.119 align:start position:0%
they have to pass the physical
 
01:07:08.789 --> 01:07:08.799 align:start position:0%
and people just
 
01:07:10.630 --> 01:07:10.640 align:start position:0%
are not willing to become troopers at
 
01:07:12.150 --> 01:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
this point in time just like they're not
 
01:07:14.069 --> 01:07:14.079 align:start position:0%
willing to become local law enforcement
 
01:07:16.470 --> 01:07:16.480 align:start position:0%
officers i would say to you that we have
 
01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:17.750 align:start position:0%
officers i would say to you that we have
vacancies

01:07:17.750 --> 01:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
vacancies
 
01:07:20.950 --> 01:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
in every lawrence law enforcement agency
 
01:07:22.230 --> 01:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
in our state
 
01:07:24.789 --> 01:07:24.799 align:start position:0%
these jobs are just very very difficult
 
01:07:28.069 --> 01:07:28.079 align:start position:0%
to fill at this time at one time there
 
01:07:29.990 --> 01:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
were thousands who wanted these jobs
 
01:07:32.150 --> 01:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
that no lo that situation no longer
 
01:07:34.470 --> 01:07:34.480 align:start position:0%
exists so it's it's a problem
 
01:07:36.150 --> 01:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
representative judy and we've got to
 
01:07:37.990 --> 01:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
address it yes
 
01:07:39.670 --> 01:07:39.680 align:start position:0%

01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:41.270 align:start position:0%

01:08:57.189 --> 01:08:57.199 align:start position:0%
january 1st of 2012
 
01:08:59.349 --> 01:08:59.359 align:start position:0%
that that cohort of group 2 members have
 
01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
different minimum age and service
 
01:09:04.709 --> 01:09:04.719 align:start position:0%
requirements uh for service retirement
 
01:09:06.470 --> 01:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
based on how many years they had in the
 
01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:07.430 align:start position:0%
based on how many years they had in the
system

01:09:07.430 --> 01:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:09:10.870 --> 01:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
as of uh january 1st of 2012.
 
01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:14.159 align:start position:0%
so the handout shows the the
 
01:09:16.630 --> 01:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
transition requirements which is how the
 
01:09:18.829 --> 01:09:18.839 align:start position:0%
statute refers to it in rsa
 
01:09:22.070 --> 01:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
105. so for instance someone who did not
 
01:09:24.470 --> 01:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
have 10 years as of uh
 
01:09:26.870 --> 01:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
january 1st of 12 but had between eight
 
01:09:29.669 --> 01:09:29.679 align:start position:0%
and ten uh their minimum age and service
 
01:09:33.110 --> 01:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
went from 45 and 20 to 46 and
 
01:09:35.349 --> 01:09:35.359 align:start position:0%
with 21 years of service and the benefit
 
01:09:37.669 --> 01:09:37.679 align:start position:0%
multiplier also decreases
 
01:09:39.910 --> 01:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
um with each
 
01:09:42.870 --> 01:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
group uh you know in uh in that middle
 
01:09:46.229 --> 01:09:46.239 align:start position:0%
middle tier of group 2 members
 
01:09:48.630 --> 01:09:48.640 align:start position:0%
also on the handout is the the number of
 
01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:49.829 align:start position:0%
also on the handout is the the number of
active

01:09:49.829 --> 01:09:49.839 align:start position:0%
active
 
01:09:52.870 --> 01:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
members in for police and fire in those
 
01:09:56.310 --> 01:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
in those slots uh as of last june 30th
 
01:09:57.669 --> 01:09:57.679 align:start position:0%
you know that number may have gone down
 
01:09:59.270 --> 01:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
slightly but that's the universe of
 
01:10:01.350 --> 01:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
people who would be eligible
 
01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:02.390 align:start position:0%
people who would be eligible
for

01:10:02.390 --> 01:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:10:04.470 --> 01:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
purchasing this service
 
01:10:07.350 --> 01:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
initially when introduced the bill was
 
01:10:09.510 --> 01:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
modeled somewhat on the non-qualified
 
01:10:11.590 --> 01:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
service purchase
 
01:10:13.430 --> 01:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
language that the representative fellows
 
01:10:16.070 --> 01:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
referenced that was open in one year
 
01:10:18.229 --> 01:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
back in 2006
 
01:10:18.239 --> 01:10:19.510 align:start position:0%
back in 2006
and

01:10:19.510 --> 01:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:10:21.510 --> 01:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
members for with no qualifying event
 
01:10:23.270 --> 01:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
could buy up to five years of additional
 
01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
service that would go into their pension
 
01:10:27.750 --> 01:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
calculation when they retired uh that
 
01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
was repealed by the legislature after a
 
01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:31.270 align:start position:0%
was repealed by the legislature after a
year

01:10:31.270 --> 01:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:10:33.189 --> 01:10:33.199 align:start position:0%
under that old
 
01:10:34.870 --> 01:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
non-qualified service and under the
 
01:10:37.110 --> 01:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
original version of senate bill 363 and
 
01:10:38.550 --> 01:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
i'm talking about the old version just
 
01:10:40.229 --> 01:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
to clarify some questions people had
 
01:10:41.830 --> 01:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
about the cost
 
01:10:43.910 --> 01:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
originally as proposed this the member
 
01:10:46.229 --> 01:10:46.239 align:start position:0%
would be paying both the employer
 
01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
contribution rate and the member
 
01:10:49.350 --> 01:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
contribution rate
 
01:10:51.110 --> 01:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
you know in effect at the time to buy
 
01:10:54.470 --> 01:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
each year so the the 45 000 comment came
 
01:10:56.149 --> 01:10:56.159 align:start position:0%
out just saying if an average group 2
 
01:10:58.790 --> 01:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
member you know in this age bracket that
 
01:10:59.910 --> 01:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
close to retirement if they had a
 
01:11:01.910 --> 01:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollar salary
 
01:11:03.430 --> 01:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
the member and the employer rate
 
01:11:05.270 --> 01:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
combined is about forty five percent of
 
01:11:07.510 --> 01:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
pay uh obviously it's it's going to be
 
01:11:10.709 --> 01:11:10.719 align:start position:0%
dependent on the person's salary um at
 
01:11:12.709 --> 01:11:12.719 align:start position:0%
that formula
 
01:11:14.870 --> 01:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
there would there the actuary assume
 
01:11:17.430 --> 01:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
there'd be a little bit of liability um
 
01:11:19.750 --> 01:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
created um sort of by the
 
01:11:21.350 --> 01:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
sort of the prop the principle of
 
01:11:23.669 --> 01:11:23.679 align:start position:0%
self-selection anybody who would be
 
01:11:25.750 --> 01:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
advantaged by this probably would take
 
01:11:27.270 --> 01:11:27.280 align:start position:0%
you know you wouldn't be looking at the
 
01:11:28.870 --> 01:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
whole universe of people
 
01:11:31.430 --> 01:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
so the bill was amended now so the
 
01:11:33.990 --> 01:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
actual full actuarial cost is assessed
 
01:11:35.910 --> 01:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
individually for each member who wants
 
01:11:38.070 --> 01:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
to purchase the service so
 
01:11:40.550 --> 01:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
the the underlying you know the
 
01:11:43.030 --> 01:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
45 is sort of a proxy but you know even
 
01:11:45.270 --> 01:11:45.280 align:start position:0%
if if you went in with that flat
 
01:11:48.390 --> 01:11:48.400 align:start position:0%
charge you know some some members may
 
01:11:50.229 --> 01:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
have paid more than they should have
 
01:11:51.830 --> 01:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
under that formula and some would have
 
01:11:53.510 --> 01:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
paid a little bit less depending on
 
01:11:55.830 --> 01:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
their salary history how close they are
 
01:11:57.110 --> 01:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
to retirement how much time they're
 
01:11:59.669 --> 01:11:59.679 align:start position:0%
buying things like that so all of our
 
01:12:02.390 --> 01:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
other service purchases um
 
01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
through the retirement system are based
 
01:12:06.470 --> 01:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
on an actuarial calculation the
 
01:12:08.870 --> 01:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
grs makes these calculators for us
 
01:12:10.790 --> 01:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
basically to run them so we would be
 
01:12:13.189 --> 01:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
doing uh the same thing for this as we
 
01:12:14.790 --> 01:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
do for other bills all of our other
 
01:12:17.110 --> 01:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
services service purchases now
 
01:12:19.910 --> 01:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
do require a qualifying event uh to buy
 
01:12:21.669 --> 01:12:21.679 align:start position:0%
the years whether it was you know you
 
01:12:23.350 --> 01:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
withdrew years before and you can buy
 
01:12:25.910 --> 01:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
those back or military service things
 
01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
like that there is no airtime free
 
01:12:31.510 --> 01:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
service you can just buy um you know and
 
01:12:34.070 --> 01:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
again this this set is limited to this
 
01:12:36.390 --> 01:12:36.400 align:start position:0%
this cohort of group two so somebody
 
01:12:37.990 --> 01:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
you know in the who is now in the
 
01:12:40.310 --> 01:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
minimum age and minimum service of 46
 
01:12:43.430 --> 01:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
and 21 can buy one year somebody who was
 
01:12:45.990 --> 01:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
in the you know age minimum age of 48
 
01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:48.640 align:start position:0%
minimum service of 23 can buy up to
 
01:12:51.030 --> 01:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
three years um
 
01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
so you know that's that's how how it is
 
01:12:56.709 --> 01:12:56.719 align:start position:0%
set up um the bill the way it's written
 
01:12:59.510 --> 01:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
set does say not less than one year so
 
01:13:01.669 --> 01:13:01.679 align:start position:0%
uh we we don't read it to allow you know
 
01:13:03.669 --> 01:13:03.679 align:start position:0%
buying months you're you're buying whole
 
01:13:05.750 --> 01:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
years you know based on the language
 
01:13:08.470 --> 01:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
that um we're looking at in the bill
 
01:13:10.310 --> 01:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
so the first
 
01:13:12.709 --> 01:13:12.719 align:start position:0%
set of group two members affected by
 
01:13:15.189 --> 01:13:15.199 align:start position:0%
this the the 46 and 21 the the you know
 
01:13:17.430 --> 01:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
the the person who started on
 
01:13:20.390 --> 01:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
you know january 2nd 2002
 
01:13:22.229 --> 01:13:22.239 align:start position:0%
um you know would have had their uh
 
01:13:23.830 --> 01:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
would have had their 20 years this year
 
01:13:26.390 --> 01:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
to retire they'd be eligible beginning
 
01:13:29.110 --> 01:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
uh early next year for that and then
 
01:13:31.830 --> 01:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
so on and so forth so that you know uh
 
01:13:33.990 --> 01:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
and one one thing about the bill as well
 
01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:34.790 align:start position:0%
and one one thing about the bill as well
is

01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:13:36.630 --> 01:13:36.640 align:start position:0%
uh on the on the handout you see how the
 
01:13:38.790 --> 01:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
benefit multiplier that's a percentage
 
01:13:40.630 --> 01:13:40.640 align:start position:0%
of the afc that you accrue for each year
 
01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
of service
 
01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:42.790 align:start position:0%
of service
um

01:13:42.790 --> 01:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:45.189 --> 01:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
goes down um
 
01:13:48.310 --> 01:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
the server the purchase time uh is at
 
01:13:49.830 --> 01:13:49.840 align:start position:0%
the two and a half percent multiplier
 
01:13:51.669 --> 01:13:51.679 align:start position:0%
which was the the original tier of group
 
01:13:54.070 --> 01:13:54.080 align:start position:0%
two so it's a slightly larger you know
 
01:13:56.310 --> 01:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
annual multiplier for that
 
01:13:58.390 --> 01:13:58.400 align:start position:0%
um you know with that i'd be glad to
 
01:14:01.510 --> 01:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
answer any questions anyone may have
 
01:14:03.110 --> 01:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
thank you representative lekkis has a
 
01:14:05.830 --> 01:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
question thank you um
 
01:14:07.990 --> 01:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
a couple things one is um
 
01:14:09.750 --> 01:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
you know from the retirement systems
 
01:14:11.669 --> 01:14:11.679 align:start position:0%
point of view do you agree that
 
01:14:12.709 --> 01:14:12.719 align:start position:0%
there will be
 
01:14:15.590 --> 01:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
no cost to the employers or the state
 
01:14:17.669 --> 01:14:17.679 align:start position:0%
including you know the uh benefits to
 
01:14:21.189 --> 01:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
retiring as a fully invested person that
 
01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
was mentioned by the chair
 
01:14:24.709 --> 01:14:24.719 align:start position:0%
other than i noticed there was a startup
 
01:14:28.470 --> 01:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
cost of around 40k is that it yes okay
 
01:14:30.149 --> 01:14:30.159 align:start position:0%
that's to build the calculator and to
 
01:14:33.430 --> 01:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
program the the pension system itself
 
01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:34.470 align:start position:0%
program the the pension system itself
follow-up

01:14:34.470 --> 01:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:14:37.189 --> 01:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
and i notice in your handout um
 
01:14:39.030 --> 01:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
it says this would not accelerate their
 
01:14:42.149 --> 01:14:42.159 align:start position:0%
eligibility for um retirement health
 
01:14:42.159 --> 01:14:43.189 align:start position:0%
eligibility for um retirement health
care

01:14:43.189 --> 01:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
care
 
01:14:45.189 --> 01:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
um so if they
 
01:14:47.350 --> 01:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
bought down a couple of years
 
01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:48.310 align:start position:0%
bought down a couple of years
then

01:14:48.310 --> 01:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:14:49.430 --> 01:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
you know they'd be on there would they
 
01:14:51.270 --> 01:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
be on their own for whatever they can do
 
01:14:52.790 --> 01:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
for health care for those two years
 
01:14:55.110 --> 01:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
until the retiree healthcare picked in
 
01:14:56.470 --> 01:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
is that part of this
 
01:14:59.750 --> 01:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
the the for for state retirees um that
 
01:15:01.350 --> 01:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
that goes you know through admin
 
01:15:02.630 --> 01:15:02.640 align:start position:0%
services and there's a whole different
 
01:15:04.470 --> 01:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
statute when you started and when you
 
01:15:07.830 --> 01:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
became eligible so so admin services on
 
01:15:09.830 --> 01:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
the original bill in the senate did
 
01:15:11.830 --> 01:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
raise concerns about would this have any
 
01:15:13.910 --> 01:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
implications for the the health care
 
01:15:15.350 --> 01:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
program and there was a section that was
 
01:15:18.149 --> 01:15:18.159 align:start position:0%
taken out of this bill so um you know
 
01:15:19.590 --> 01:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
and again we don't administer that but
 
01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
that that's the reason so
 
01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:22.830 align:start position:0%
that that's the reason so
if

01:15:22.830 --> 01:15:22.840 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:15:25.590 --> 01:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
i i'm not sure how many years someone
 
01:15:27.430 --> 01:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
needed in group two to qualify for the
 
01:15:29.669 --> 01:15:29.679 align:start position:0%
insurance before but it this is only
 
01:15:31.590 --> 01:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
specific to the retirement system i
 
01:15:34.470 --> 01:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
believe it it's 20 years at this point
 
01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:35.430 align:start position:0%
believe it it's 20 years at this point
it

01:15:35.430 --> 01:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:15:37.270 --> 01:15:37.280 align:start position:0%
it was 10 years for a while but i
 
01:15:39.590 --> 01:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
believe it's 20 right now
 
01:15:41.510 --> 01:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
and quit one quick follow follow up and
 
01:15:43.189 --> 01:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
that is um
 
01:15:45.750 --> 01:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
i know you can't predict this but
 
01:15:47.189 --> 01:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
i mean do you think it's likely that
 
01:15:48.229 --> 01:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
enough people are going to take
 
01:15:49.910 --> 01:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
advantage of this to make you know this
 
01:15:51.510 --> 01:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
whole thing including the startup cost
 
01:15:53.910 --> 01:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
worthwhile i'm a little skeptical um
 
01:15:55.990 --> 01:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
yeah it's it's really hard to say
 
01:15:57.510 --> 01:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
because it's a new
 
01:16:00.550 --> 01:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
type of service purchase for a for a
 
01:16:02.470 --> 01:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
specific group of people
 
01:16:04.310 --> 01:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
so um you know
 
01:16:07.110 --> 01:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
talking to some of the to the uh folks
 
01:16:09.669 --> 01:16:09.679 align:start position:0%
who were were working on the bill
 
01:16:11.110 --> 01:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
you know and also you know on the
 
01:16:13.110 --> 01:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
actuary we're anywhere you know five
 
01:16:15.110 --> 01:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
percent or less of the total population
 
01:16:17.110 --> 01:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
maybe closer to two or three is what
 
01:16:18.470 --> 01:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
people are saying and they they i think
 
01:16:20.390 --> 01:16:20.400 align:start position:0%
they can probably speak to their
 
01:16:21.830 --> 01:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
groups that they represent what they're
 
01:16:24.149 --> 01:16:24.159 align:start position:0%
hearing um so so we do expect it to be
 
01:16:25.669 --> 01:16:25.679 align:start position:0%
somewhat of a niche
 
01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
piece but you know if it's available for
 
01:16:28.950 --> 01:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
people who
 
01:16:30.870 --> 01:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
have the means in the desire to take
 
01:16:33.669 --> 01:16:33.679 align:start position:0%
advantage of it you know we don't have a
 
01:16:35.350 --> 01:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
trouble administering it
 
01:16:37.669 --> 01:16:37.679 align:start position:0%
thank you representative allegro thank
 
01:16:40.470 --> 01:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
you i um on merits or i should say on
 
01:16:42.470 --> 01:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
the issue of fairness i think
 
01:16:45.510 --> 01:16:45.520 align:start position:0%
it stands alone on its own merit
 
01:16:47.669 --> 01:16:47.679 align:start position:0%
but in terms of recruitment and
 
01:16:49.830 --> 01:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
retention i'm not clear on a couple
 
01:16:51.990 --> 01:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
things maybe you can answer my question
 
01:16:53.910 --> 01:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
or someone else can
 
01:16:55.990 --> 01:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of recruitment
 
01:16:57.910 --> 01:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
anyone who hasn't been hired yet is not
 
01:16:59.350 --> 01:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
going to be eligible for this program
 
01:17:01.270 --> 01:17:01.280 align:start position:0%
correct so it really won't impact
 
01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:02.630 align:start position:0%
correct so it really won't impact
recruitment

01:17:02.630 --> 01:17:02.640 align:start position:0%
recruitment
 
01:17:04.790 --> 01:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
yeah correct this is only for the people
 
01:17:06.550 --> 01:17:06.560 align:start position:0%
who are in the system
 
01:17:09.669 --> 01:17:09.679 align:start position:0%
and on in terms of uh retention
 
01:17:12.149 --> 01:17:12.159 align:start position:0%
anybody who's indicated a desire to buy
 
01:17:13.270 --> 01:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
one year
 
01:17:15.590 --> 01:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
is going to be gone in one year now but
 
01:17:16.950 --> 01:17:16.960 align:start position:0%
i understand am i understanding that
 
01:17:18.550 --> 01:17:18.560 align:start position:0%
correctly or
 
01:17:22.310 --> 01:17:22.320 align:start position:0%
they can buy the year at any time
 
01:17:25.350 --> 01:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
and so they may buy it immediately or
 
01:17:28.229 --> 01:17:28.239 align:start position:0%
when they can afford it or
 
01:17:33.110 --> 01:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:35.430 --> 01:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
very shortly before they retire okay but
 
01:17:37.750 --> 01:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
technically they they can buy it when
 
01:17:40.070 --> 01:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
they're in there for 11 years saying i
 
01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
you know i don't think i want to do this
 
01:17:43.990 --> 01:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
for another nine or whatever and they
 
01:17:46.390 --> 01:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
could buy a year or two early okay thank
 
01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:48.070 align:start position:0%
could buy a year or two early okay thank
you

01:17:48.070 --> 01:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:17:49.510 --> 01:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
01:17:51.910 --> 01:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien and then fellow
 
01:17:54.229 --> 01:17:54.239 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair uh mr collins
 
01:17:56.630 --> 01:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
this may be just a wee bit out of your
 
01:17:59.350 --> 01:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
league with the nhrs but basically
 
01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
thinking on a municipal end where you
 
01:18:03.910 --> 01:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
have a long-term employee he goes
 
01:18:06.390 --> 01:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
through some contractual raises perhaps
 
01:18:09.270 --> 01:18:09.280 align:start position:0%
promotions and he's pretty much at the
 
01:18:11.189 --> 01:18:11.199 align:start position:0%
top of some game
 
01:18:13.910 --> 01:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
so if this you know kind of helps people
 
01:18:15.910 --> 01:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
at that high end
 
01:18:18.790 --> 01:18:18.800 align:start position:0%
go and and you say with retention there
 
01:18:20.990 --> 01:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
could be a cost factor to the you know
 
01:18:22.790 --> 01:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
municipalities or the political
 
01:18:25.510 --> 01:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
subdivisions and hiring people at the
 
01:18:27.990 --> 01:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
lower grade and starting pay
 
01:18:30.950 --> 01:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
uh to help out and uh that could be a
 
01:18:33.189 --> 01:18:33.199 align:start position:0%
you know a hidden benefit of this with
 
01:18:37.110 --> 01:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
the uh local taxpayers i'll i'll concur
 
01:18:38.390 --> 01:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
with your initial statement that it's a
 
01:18:39.350 --> 01:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
little bit out of my league
 
01:18:41.350 --> 01:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
representative yeah i i kind of figured
 
01:18:44.390 --> 01:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
that thank you mr congress
 
01:18:46.550 --> 01:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um
 
01:18:48.390 --> 01:18:48.400 align:start position:0%
i have a question you said that it might
 
01:18:50.550 --> 01:18:50.560 align:start position:0%
be two or three percent
 
01:18:53.510 --> 01:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
that it's just a you know a
 
01:18:56.550 --> 01:18:56.560 align:start position:0%
very a guess well with
 
01:18:59.030 --> 01:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
with eighteen hundred people
 
01:19:01.590 --> 01:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
two or three percent is like twenty or
 
01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:03.189 align:start position:0%
two or three percent is like twenty or
thirty

01:19:03.189 --> 01:19:03.199 align:start position:0%
thirty
 
01:19:06.229 --> 01:19:06.239 align:start position:0%
i think um or two or three depends
 
01:19:11.189 --> 01:19:11.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:14.310 --> 01:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
18 yeah so 20 maybe 20 people so it's
 
01:19:17.030 --> 01:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
costing us a couple of thousand each
 
01:19:21.030 --> 01:19:21.040 align:start position:0%
to uh to administer this
 
01:19:23.830 --> 01:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
so we'll i will be uh
 
01:19:25.350 --> 01:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
looking at the
 
01:19:26.870 --> 01:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
or listening to the people who are
 
01:19:29.590 --> 01:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
speaking on the next i think the uptake
 
01:19:31.189 --> 01:19:31.199 align:start position:0%
certainly could be higher there's really
 
01:19:33.110 --> 01:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
no way of predicting it's like if the
 
01:19:34.950 --> 01:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
bill passes and people start getting
 
01:19:37.350 --> 01:19:37.360 align:start position:0%
estimates and deciding it makes sense
 
01:19:38.790 --> 01:19:38.800 align:start position:0%
for them or not then that's the only
 
01:19:40.550 --> 01:19:40.560 align:start position:0%
time we'll know is after that starts
 
01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:41.590 align:start position:0%
time we'll know is after that starts
happening

01:19:41.590 --> 01:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
happening
 
01:19:42.790 --> 01:19:42.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there other
 
01:19:45.110 --> 01:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
questions represent fellows yes sorry
 
01:19:48.709 --> 01:19:48.719 align:start position:0%
so um i i have two questions
 
01:19:51.430 --> 01:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
um i'm looking at the bill and starting
 
01:19:55.270 --> 01:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:57.750 --> 01:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
you could just explain to me exactly
 
01:20:00.229 --> 01:20:00.239 align:start position:0%
what's going on it's it says
 
01:20:04.310 --> 01:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:06.870 --> 01:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
the service
 
01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
until it's
 
01:20:10.070 --> 01:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
fully paid for and something about the
 
01:20:12.629 --> 01:20:12.639 align:start position:0%
money going into the members annuity
 
01:20:16.790 --> 01:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
savings fund and my second question is
 
01:20:19.430 --> 01:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
if they buy the
 
01:20:21.270 --> 01:20:21.280 align:start position:0%
the extra credit
 
01:20:23.510 --> 01:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
today well not today but when the bill
 
01:20:26.870 --> 01:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
first is approved
 
01:20:30.550 --> 01:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
compared to buying it the same amount
 
01:20:32.870 --> 01:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
two or three years later is the cost
 
01:20:35.990 --> 01:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
going to go up the longer they wait
 
01:20:39.030 --> 01:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
so that's two questions of this annuity
 
01:20:40.629 --> 01:20:40.639 align:start position:0%
when when does it take
 
01:20:43.030 --> 01:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
when do they actually have something to
 
01:20:44.310 --> 01:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
hold on to
 
01:20:44.320 --> 01:20:45.430 align:start position:0%
hold on to
and

01:20:45.430 --> 01:20:45.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:20:48.149 --> 01:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
what is the issue with the annuity
 
01:20:51.030 --> 01:20:51.040 align:start position:0%
savings fund and will it cost more if
 
01:20:53.110 --> 01:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
they delay three questions i'll take the
 
01:20:55.430 --> 01:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
first quest the the annuity savings fund
 
01:20:57.030 --> 01:20:57.040 align:start position:0%
address that first
 
01:20:59.430 --> 01:20:59.440 align:start position:0%
basically when members contribute um you
 
01:21:01.030 --> 01:21:01.040 align:start position:0%
know they're in their individual
 
01:21:03.350 --> 01:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
contributions plus any statutory
 
01:21:05.430 --> 01:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
interest credited to them is in in the
 
01:21:07.110 --> 01:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
members individual account and all of
 
01:21:09.110 --> 01:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
those individual individual accounts are
 
01:21:11.430 --> 01:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
part of the member annuity savings fund
 
01:21:14.070 --> 01:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
so in other words if someone bought a
 
01:21:16.070 --> 01:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
year of service and and you know paid us
 
01:21:18.550 --> 01:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
another you know forty to fifty thousand
 
01:21:20.950 --> 01:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
dollars to buy that year that's gonna be
 
01:21:22.870 --> 01:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
credited to their individual
 
01:21:25.750 --> 01:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
contributions you know so so it doesn't
 
01:21:27.750 --> 01:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
you know if they chose to cash out when
 
01:21:29.350 --> 01:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
they terminated they could take all that
 
01:21:31.590 --> 01:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
they get that money back if they passed
 
01:21:32.950 --> 01:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
away they'll if they didn't have a you
 
01:21:34.790 --> 01:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
know a designated beneficiary for
 
01:21:36.790 --> 01:21:36.800 align:start position:0%
benefit that that would be paid back to
 
01:21:38.550 --> 01:21:38.560 align:start position:0%
the beneficiary so it's basically it's
 
01:21:40.550 --> 01:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
still the members money when it's in the
 
01:21:42.629 --> 01:21:42.639 align:start position:0%
member in the member annuity savings
 
01:21:44.629 --> 01:21:44.639 align:start position:0%
fund so that's just sort of you know the
 
01:21:46.629 --> 01:21:46.639 align:start position:0%
way that works it and in terms of the
 
01:21:46.639 --> 01:21:47.750 align:start position:0%
way that works it and in terms of the
cost

01:21:47.750 --> 01:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
cost
 
01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:48.870 align:start position:0%
cost
um

01:21:48.870 --> 01:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:51.350 --> 01:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
i think in general terms you know the
 
01:21:53.270 --> 01:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
higher your salary the closer you are to
 
01:21:57.510 --> 01:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
retirement you know the cost is is
 
01:21:59.270 --> 01:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
generally speaking going to be larger
 
01:22:01.590 --> 01:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
than somebody you know somebody who's
 
01:22:02.629 --> 01:22:02.639 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:22:05.830 --> 01:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
44 versus you know 34 you know they're
 
01:22:07.590 --> 01:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
probably making less you know they're
 
01:22:09.270 --> 01:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
farther away from retirement you know so
 
01:22:11.830 --> 01:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
the the actual cost could be different
 
01:22:13.430 --> 01:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
for that person you know but there's a
 
01:22:15.110 --> 01:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
lot of different factors it's also you
 
01:22:17.270 --> 01:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
know what their salary is um you know
 
01:22:19.430 --> 01:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
what the projected salaries are how long
 
01:22:21.030 --> 01:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
out you know are they that they have to
 
01:22:23.110 --> 01:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
go to retirement but generally speaking
 
01:22:25.270 --> 01:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
yes it's probably cheaper to buy it
 
01:22:28.390 --> 01:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
sooner than right at the end but um
 
01:22:30.950 --> 01:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
you know assumptions do change so if if
 
01:22:32.550 --> 01:22:32.560 align:start position:0%
you know if we were to change the actual
 
01:22:34.310 --> 01:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
assumptions if the assume rate of return
 
01:22:35.990 --> 01:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
went up or down that would have an
 
01:22:38.229 --> 01:22:38.239 align:start position:0%
impact on the actuarial cost of this you
 
01:22:39.430 --> 01:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
know we're not looking at that for
 
01:22:41.910 --> 01:22:41.920 align:start position:0%
another couple of years at the earliest
 
01:22:43.669 --> 01:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
but you know so so there are sort of
 
01:22:46.070 --> 01:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
variables in the actuarial world that
 
01:22:47.669 --> 01:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
could play into it but you know
 
01:22:50.709 --> 01:22:50.719 align:start position:0%
generally speaking yeah you know
 
01:22:52.390 --> 01:22:52.400 align:start position:0%
tends to be less expensive to buy it
 
01:22:55.350 --> 01:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:01.110 --> 01:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:03.430 --> 01:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
whether one person
 
01:23:06.310 --> 01:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
takes advantage of this or 20 people the
 
01:23:08.070 --> 01:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
cost to the new hampshire retirement
 
01:23:10.070 --> 01:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
system would be 40 000 is that correct
 
01:23:12.229 --> 01:23:12.239 align:start position:0%
yeah that's that's a that's a high-end
 
01:23:14.790 --> 01:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
estimate but yes yeah once the software
 
01:23:16.950 --> 01:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
is set up to accommodate it you know it
 
01:23:18.870 --> 01:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter how many
 
01:23:21.270 --> 01:23:21.280 align:start position:0%
may i have a follow-up thank you
 
01:23:23.830 --> 01:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
so let's say someone
 
01:23:26.629 --> 01:23:26.639 align:start position:0%
has nine years to go
 
01:23:28.709 --> 01:23:28.719 align:start position:0%
and they think that they want to work
 
01:23:31.110 --> 01:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
for another seven
 
01:23:35.510 --> 01:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
they could at the time at time zero
 
01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:36.470 align:start position:0%
they could at the time at time zero
start

01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
start
 
01:23:38.870 --> 01:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
this extra payment through installments
 
01:23:40.629 --> 01:23:40.639 align:start position:0%
into the new hampshire retirement system
 
01:23:42.629 --> 01:23:42.639 align:start position:0%
so they could retire two years early if
 
01:23:44.470 --> 01:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
they were indeed supposed to work until
 
01:23:46.390 --> 01:23:46.400 align:start position:0%
20 years
 
01:23:48.790 --> 01:23:48.800 align:start position:0%
is that correct the bill does allow for
 
01:23:51.270 --> 01:23:51.280 align:start position:0%
installment payments um yes i you know
 
01:23:53.910 --> 01:23:53.920 align:start position:0%
if the bill passes i i would assume the
 
01:23:56.310 --> 01:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
the board would work with staff to come
 
01:23:58.390 --> 01:23:58.400 align:start position:0%
up with some written policy on that we
 
01:23:59.910 --> 01:23:59.920 align:start position:0%
don't we don't have one now because it
 
01:24:02.149 --> 01:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist but you know that that is
 
01:24:04.470 --> 01:24:04.480 align:start position:0%
would yeah if if you weren't going to be
 
01:24:06.229 --> 01:24:06.239 align:start position:0%
you weren't eligible to retire for five
 
01:24:08.390 --> 01:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
years you may be able to pay that off
 
01:24:10.149 --> 01:24:10.159 align:start position:0%
in pieces but again that that'll be the
 
01:24:11.750 --> 01:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
board's final decision but the bill does
 
01:24:14.149 --> 01:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
allow that to be set up that way
 
01:24:16.470 --> 01:24:16.480 align:start position:0%
okay and last follow-up so i just want
 
01:24:18.470 --> 01:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
to make sure that because you know as
 
01:24:20.310 --> 01:24:20.320 align:start position:0%
things as you approach retirement
 
01:24:22.070 --> 01:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
sometimes things change
 
01:24:23.590 --> 01:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
and you decide that let's say you've
 
01:24:25.189 --> 01:24:25.199 align:start position:0%
paid for the for the two years and you
 
01:24:27.750 --> 01:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
decide you want to stay a longer
 
01:24:29.510 --> 01:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
how flexible is this program going to be
 
01:24:31.990 --> 01:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
for those employees
 
01:24:33.510 --> 01:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
once you've purchased the service you
 
01:24:35.590 --> 01:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
have the service okay and you know that
 
01:24:37.830 --> 01:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
you yeah there's there's no
 
01:24:39.750 --> 01:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
i changed my mind can i get a refund i
 
01:24:41.189 --> 01:24:41.199 align:start position:0%
mean you bought the service that's in
 
01:24:43.110 --> 01:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
your record you know your pension will
 
01:24:45.270 --> 01:24:45.280 align:start position:0%
be based on it you know and i had heard
 
01:24:47.189 --> 01:24:47.199 align:start position:0%
anecdotally with the five years there
 
01:24:49.350 --> 01:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
were some people who ended up going out
 
01:24:51.270 --> 01:24:51.280 align:start position:0%
on a disability benefit so buying the
 
01:24:52.709 --> 01:24:52.719 align:start position:0%
five years was kind of pointless for
 
01:24:52.719 --> 01:24:53.510 align:start position:0%
five years was kind of pointless for
them

01:24:53.510 --> 01:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:24:55.030 --> 01:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
but you know that's
 
01:24:56.709 --> 01:24:56.719 align:start position:0%
you know there are risks in life with
 
01:24:58.629 --> 01:24:58.639 align:start position:0%
everything um you know but this is
 
01:25:00.629 --> 01:25:00.639 align:start position:0%
buying yourself an earlier retirement
 
01:25:03.270 --> 01:25:03.280 align:start position:0%
age you know in a more years of service
 
01:25:05.590 --> 01:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
in which to base the benefit so just for
 
01:25:07.110 --> 01:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
clarification i just want to make sure
 
01:25:09.110 --> 01:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
i'm not asking for a refund but let's
 
01:25:10.870 --> 01:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
say that employee they let's say they
 
01:25:12.470 --> 01:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
pay for the two years that two years is
 
01:25:14.229 --> 01:25:14.239 align:start position:0%
in the bank is in their bank and they
 
01:25:16.149 --> 01:25:16.159 align:start position:0%
can work a little longer if they wish to
 
01:25:17.669 --> 01:25:17.679 align:start position:0%
oh absolutely you could but you could
 
01:25:19.270 --> 01:25:19.280 align:start position:0%
buy it but you don't have to go out at
 
01:25:20.790 --> 01:25:20.800 align:start position:0%
the minimum i mean if you bought it and
 
01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:21.510 align:start position:0%
the minimum i mean if you bought it and
then

01:25:21.510 --> 01:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:25:22.950 --> 01:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
circumstances change and you want to
 
01:25:24.790 --> 01:25:24.800 align:start position:0%
work another five or even 10 years you
 
01:25:26.550 --> 01:25:26.560 align:start position:0%
know yes it doesn't force anybody to
 
01:25:28.629 --> 01:25:28.639 align:start position:0%
leave early if they bought the time they
 
01:25:30.550 --> 01:25:30.560 align:start position:0%
just had more time when they did finally
 
01:25:33.510 --> 01:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
terminate okay thank you so much
 
01:25:36.310 --> 01:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:38.870 --> 01:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much mr carlin
 
01:25:53.590 --> 01:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:55.590 --> 01:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank all of
 
01:25:57.030 --> 01:25:57.040 align:start position:0%
you for being here
 
01:25:58.790 --> 01:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
i'll try and keep it brief i just wanted
 
01:26:01.430 --> 01:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
to clear up a couple of things
 
01:26:03.510 --> 01:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
um obviously i'm not super versed on
 
01:26:05.110 --> 01:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
this doesn't sound like anybody really
 
01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:05.990 align:start position:0%
this doesn't sound like anybody really
is

01:26:05.990 --> 01:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:26:08.550 --> 01:26:08.560 align:start position:0%
the exact impact of it
 
01:26:10.310 --> 01:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
but as i understand it i know the
 
01:26:12.470 --> 01:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
question was posed about fairness and
 
01:26:14.229 --> 01:26:14.239 align:start position:0%
i'm glad it was posed because no it's
 
01:26:16.229 --> 01:26:16.239 align:start position:0%
not feel fair
 
01:26:17.990 --> 01:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
11 years ago when they changed our
 
01:26:20.070 --> 01:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
pension system and
 
01:26:22.070 --> 01:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
affected people like myself who had
 
01:26:23.830 --> 01:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
about six years of service in at that
 
01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:25.030 align:start position:0%
about six years of service in at that
time

01:26:25.030 --> 01:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:26:27.030 --> 01:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
didn't feel fair because this bill never
 
01:26:29.270 --> 01:26:29.280 align:start position:0%
passed this was christmas tree onto the
 
01:26:31.910 --> 01:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
omnibus spending bill and it effectively
 
01:26:34.229 --> 01:26:34.239 align:start position:0%
sentenced me to three years in prison
 
01:26:36.790 --> 01:26:36.800 align:start position:0%
so now that did not feel fair
 
01:26:38.390 --> 01:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
this does a little something to help
 
01:26:39.750 --> 01:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
correct that
 
01:26:41.350 --> 01:26:41.360 align:start position:0%
i didn't start my career in state
 
01:26:43.669 --> 01:26:43.679 align:start position:0%
service i worked in the private sector
 
01:26:45.830 --> 01:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
for many years and i came to work for
 
01:26:49.270 --> 01:26:49.280 align:start position:0%
the state when i was 35 years old
 
01:26:51.669 --> 01:26:51.679 align:start position:0%
with the amendments with the changes
 
01:26:53.270 --> 01:26:53.280 align:start position:0%
they made to this i can't retire until
 
01:26:55.350 --> 01:26:55.360 align:start position:0%
i'm 58 years old
 
01:26:57.110 --> 01:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
i work every day in a prison i'm
 
01:27:00.149 --> 01:27:00.159 align:start position:0%
outnumbered usually around 150 to 1.
 
01:27:01.669 --> 01:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
just the other day
 
01:27:03.830 --> 01:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
about 2-3 days ago i was working in the
 
01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:04.790 align:start position:0%
about 2-3 days ago i was working in the
kitchen

01:27:04.790 --> 01:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
kitchen
 
01:27:06.470 --> 01:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
and i stumbled across
 
01:27:09.430 --> 01:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
a very large gentleman probably over six
 
01:27:11.990 --> 01:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
feet tall easily over six feet tall and
 
01:27:13.590 --> 01:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
several hundred pounds
 
01:27:16.070 --> 01:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
i'm about to like k2
 
01:27:18.550 --> 01:27:18.560 align:start position:0%
i was by myself in the kitchen core
 
01:27:22.390 --> 01:27:22.400 align:start position:0%
and i needed to secure the evidence and
 
01:27:23.910 --> 01:27:23.920 align:start position:0%
secure the inmate
 
01:27:25.830 --> 01:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
that's what i do for a living
 
01:27:27.910 --> 01:27:27.920 align:start position:0%
i have a hard enough time doing it at 50
 
01:27:30.390 --> 01:27:30.400 align:start position:0%
and at 58 i can't
 
01:27:32.550 --> 01:27:32.560 align:start position:0%
i don't think that i can do this
 
01:27:34.709 --> 01:27:34.719 align:start position:0%
for eight more years i just don't think
 
01:27:36.229 --> 01:27:36.239 align:start position:0%
i can
 
01:27:38.310 --> 01:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe five
 
01:27:39.830 --> 01:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
that was my original deals i could
 
01:27:41.830 --> 01:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
retire at 55 and this is hard enough to
 
01:27:44.709 --> 01:27:44.719 align:start position:0%
do at 55. just to be here today to
 
01:27:46.950 --> 01:27:46.960 align:start position:0%
testify i had to refuse force that's
 
01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:47.910 align:start position:0%
testify i had to refuse force that's
because

01:27:47.910 --> 01:27:47.920 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:27:50.709 --> 01:27:50.719 align:start position:0%
i worked overtime yesterday and i was
 
01:27:52.470 --> 01:27:52.480 align:start position:0%
forced again this morning and the
 
01:27:54.470 --> 01:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
prisons running short
 
01:27:57.030 --> 01:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
it's very taxing the job that i do is
 
01:27:57.040 --> 01:27:58.709 align:start position:0%
it's very taxing the job that i do is
exhausting

01:27:58.709 --> 01:27:58.719 align:start position:0%
exhausting
 
01:28:01.189 --> 01:28:01.199 align:start position:0%
mr scitec i know your wife very well
 
01:28:03.189 --> 01:28:03.199 align:start position:0%
she sat on the parole board so she knows
 
01:28:04.709 --> 01:28:04.719 align:start position:0%
me i let her in every single day and
 
01:28:06.950 --> 01:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
what's interesting about that i work
 
01:28:09.430 --> 01:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
third shift
 
01:28:11.750 --> 01:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
i know her because i worked overtime
 
01:28:13.669 --> 01:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
every day in that particular post i
 
01:28:16.470 --> 01:28:16.480 align:start position:0%
don't do that anymore i walk the tears
 
01:28:19.110 --> 01:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
16 hours a day and i am amongst the
 
01:28:22.310 --> 01:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
inmates usually alone with a radio that
 
01:28:23.990 --> 01:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
often doesn't work
 
01:28:25.510 --> 01:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
it's scary
 
01:28:27.030 --> 01:28:27.040 align:start position:0%
i don't want to do this for eight more
 
01:28:29.430 --> 01:28:29.440 align:start position:0%
years i don't really want to do it for
 
01:28:31.669 --> 01:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
five but at least it puts the carrot
 
01:28:31.679 --> 01:28:33.030 align:start position:0%
five but at least it puts the carrot
closer

01:28:33.030 --> 01:28:33.040 align:start position:0%
closer
 
01:28:35.669 --> 01:28:35.679 align:start position:0%
and as he kind of pointed out there or
 
01:28:37.990 --> 01:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
she did as far as vested for benefits
 
01:28:41.030 --> 01:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
that if i don't make it
 
01:28:43.750 --> 01:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
my heirs would only get the uh monies
 
01:28:45.350 --> 01:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
that were put into my account my
 
01:28:46.870 --> 01:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
individual account
 
01:28:48.550 --> 01:28:48.560 align:start position:0%
that's just the way our pension system
 
01:28:49.510 --> 01:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
set up
 
01:28:52.149 --> 01:28:52.159 align:start position:0%
so my family would get the monies that i
 
01:28:54.310 --> 01:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
put in and that's it with uh some
 
01:28:56.709 --> 01:28:56.719 align:start position:0%
statutory interest
 
01:28:56.719 --> 01:28:58.310 align:start position:0%
statutory interest
so

01:28:58.310 --> 01:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:28:59.750 --> 01:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
is it fair note
 
01:29:02.149 --> 01:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
is it cost prohibitive perhaps
 
01:29:05.350 --> 01:29:05.360 align:start position:0%
but what is a year of your life worth
 
01:29:09.510 --> 01:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
is it worth 40 000 it is to me
 
01:29:11.350 --> 01:29:11.360 align:start position:0%
my husband's terminal i want to be with
 
01:29:14.550 --> 01:29:14.560 align:start position:0%
my grandkids that's a year of my life
 
01:29:16.229 --> 01:29:16.239 align:start position:0%
it's about as much as my daughter's
 
01:29:19.110 --> 01:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
spending to buy her condo right now so
 
01:29:21.350 --> 01:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
no it doesn't feel super fair but it's
 
01:29:23.270 --> 01:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
an opportunity that i might be able to
 
01:29:25.189 --> 01:29:25.199 align:start position:0%
make it to retirement
 
01:29:27.669 --> 01:29:27.679 align:start position:0%
and i want to make it to retirement
 
01:29:29.669 --> 01:29:29.679 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to lie
 
01:29:31.910 --> 01:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
so i'm glad for people like yourself
 
01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:32.709 align:start position:0%
so i'm glad for people like yourself
that

01:29:32.709 --> 01:29:32.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:29:34.950 --> 01:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
got to buy your years of service
 
01:29:36.950 --> 01:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
that were much cheaper military times
 
01:29:40.310 --> 01:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
cheaper this is expensive
 
01:29:42.310 --> 01:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
but it's a matter of worth and it's you
 
01:29:44.229 --> 01:29:44.239 align:start position:0%
know worth it to me it changes my
 
01:29:46.790 --> 01:29:46.800 align:start position:0%
calculation so that when i do retire
 
01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:47.590 align:start position:0%
calculation so that when i do retire
my

01:29:47.590 --> 01:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:29:50.229 --> 01:29:50.239 align:start position:0%
my pension would be a little higher
 
01:29:51.910 --> 01:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
and that's obviously important because
 
01:29:54.470 --> 01:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
inflation's a reality and i also get
 
01:29:56.390 --> 01:29:56.400 align:start position:0%
penalized with the
 
01:29:58.950 --> 01:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
windfall tax so my social security is
 
01:30:00.790 --> 01:30:00.800 align:start position:0%
penalized as well
 
01:30:00.800 --> 01:30:01.910 align:start position:0%
penalized as well
so

01:30:01.910 --> 01:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:30:04.550 --> 01:30:04.560 align:start position:0%
by being able to even recover just a
 
01:30:06.470 --> 01:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
little bit of what was taken away from
 
01:30:09.830 --> 01:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
us in that omnibus spending bill
 
01:30:12.470 --> 01:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
it it's something it's i'm not going to
 
01:30:17.990 --> 01:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:19.669 --> 01:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
01:30:22.709 --> 01:30:22.719 align:start position:0%
questions representative schuett
 
01:30:24.229 --> 01:30:24.239 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:30:25.990 --> 01:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
first off thank you very much for your
 
01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:27.430 align:start position:0%
first off thank you very much for your
service

01:30:27.430 --> 01:30:27.440 align:start position:0%
service
 
01:30:30.950 --> 01:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
um i just curious i sounding
 
01:30:32.950 --> 01:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
from what you just said
 
01:30:34.629 --> 01:30:34.639 align:start position:0%
it sounds like
 
01:30:36.629 --> 01:30:36.639 align:start position:0%
you would be willing to say take a
 
01:30:38.790 --> 01:30:38.800 align:start position:0%
second mortgage on your house
 
01:30:40.629 --> 01:30:40.639 align:start position:0%
in order to be able to afford this and
 
01:30:42.629 --> 01:30:42.639 align:start position:0%
you feel that would be a better benefit
 
01:30:44.550 --> 01:30:44.560 align:start position:0%
for you
 
01:30:47.750 --> 01:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
i did like the fact that it allows
 
01:30:49.750 --> 01:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
make to make payments so that i could
 
01:30:51.430 --> 01:30:51.440 align:start position:0%
maybe spread this over the rest of my
 
01:30:53.510 --> 01:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
career and i think that would affect
 
01:30:55.510 --> 01:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
retention because
 
01:30:57.590 --> 01:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
obviously if you know i'm spending a
 
01:30:59.830 --> 01:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
hundred and twenty thousand dollars
 
01:31:01.189 --> 01:31:01.199 align:start position:0%
i'm probably going to have to work a few
 
01:31:03.350 --> 01:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
more years you know to make those types
 
01:31:05.030 --> 01:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
of payments
 
01:31:06.709 --> 01:31:06.719 align:start position:0%
but that would make it you know so i
 
01:31:08.870 --> 01:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
could still retire at 55
 
01:31:10.950 --> 01:31:10.960 align:start position:0%
and uh you know that's important to me
 
01:31:12.790 --> 01:31:12.800 align:start position:0%
and that changes the calculation because
 
01:31:15.030 --> 01:31:15.040 align:start position:0%
i was looking at leaving state service
 
01:31:17.590 --> 01:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
to start undoing my windfall tax
 
01:31:19.750 --> 01:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
um so it there's a there's a few
 
01:31:24.390 --> 01:31:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:27.510 --> 01:31:27.520 align:start position:0%
hey thank you representative
 
01:31:29.270 --> 01:31:29.280 align:start position:0%
can i tell donna you said hello could
 
01:31:31.189 --> 01:31:31.199 align:start position:0%
you please i'm sorry i wasn't invited to
 
01:31:32.709 --> 01:31:32.719 align:start position:0%
the retirement party i would have been
 
01:31:32.719 --> 01:31:34.790 align:start position:0%
the retirement party i would have been
there

01:31:34.790 --> 01:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:31:36.229 --> 01:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
oh well
 
01:31:39.270 --> 01:31:39.280 align:start position:0%
anna aren't you yes representative judy
 
01:31:39.280 --> 01:31:40.070 align:start position:0%
anna aren't you yes representative judy
yes

01:31:40.070 --> 01:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:31:44.070 --> 01:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
good morning ma'am good morning um
 
01:31:47.110 --> 01:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
correct me if i want because i heard you
 
01:31:49.350 --> 01:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
say the radio is broken
 
01:31:51.510 --> 01:31:51.520 align:start position:0%
pardon me the radio is broken and then
 
01:31:54.229 --> 01:31:54.239 align:start position:0%
you work with one quite often our radios
 
01:31:56.550 --> 01:31:56.560 align:start position:0%
fail to function we have a problem with
 
01:31:58.629 --> 01:31:58.639 align:start position:0%
the equipment it's uh
 
01:32:00.790 --> 01:32:00.800 align:start position:0%
i guess old the batteries just tend not
 
01:32:03.590 --> 01:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
to work and we have to share them so
 
01:32:05.110 --> 01:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
they don't indicate when they're dying
 
01:32:07.110 --> 01:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
so you find out this was the second time
 
01:32:09.110 --> 01:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
that i was in the kitchen core and i
 
01:32:11.910 --> 01:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
caught an offender with drugs and the
 
01:32:13.990 --> 01:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
first time my radio did fail to function
 
01:32:15.910 --> 01:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
as i called for the response team they
 
01:32:17.590 --> 01:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
couldn't hear me because when you key
 
01:32:19.189 --> 01:32:19.199 align:start position:0%
your radio it beeps
 
01:32:20.950 --> 01:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
and uh so they couldn't hear my
 
01:32:22.790 --> 01:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
transmission and didn't know where i was
 
01:32:24.470 --> 01:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
so i was left alone to wrestle the
 
01:32:26.070 --> 01:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
inmate but i was a younger girl at the
 
01:32:26.080 --> 01:32:27.189 align:start position:0%
inmate but i was a younger girl at the
time

01:32:27.189 --> 01:32:27.199 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:32:29.590 --> 01:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
this time i was looking he's a big guy
 
01:32:31.510 --> 01:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
i i wanted to be like oh i don't see
 
01:32:33.110 --> 01:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
that and walk away but that's not what
 
01:32:35.189 --> 01:32:35.199 align:start position:0%
you pay me for and i did my job
 
01:32:38.950 --> 01:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
fortunately it worked out very well wow
 
01:32:41.830 --> 01:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
yes and my radio did work by the way so
 
01:32:43.830 --> 01:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
back up okay
 
01:32:45.830 --> 01:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
i'm really sorry about that
 
01:32:48.470 --> 01:32:48.480 align:start position:0%

01:32:52.470 --> 01:32:52.480 align:start position:0%
time to share this with us thank you all
 
01:32:53.750 --> 01:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
for your service
 
01:33:03.110 --> 01:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:04.709 --> 01:33:04.719 align:start position:0%

i'm madam chairwoman uh my name is
 
01:33:11.830 --> 01:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
joseph ebert it's eb ert
 
01:33:14.149 --> 01:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
i'm a major with the state police i
 
01:33:15.750 --> 01:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
oversee our investigative services
 
01:33:15.760 --> 01:33:16.870 align:start position:0%
oversee our investigative services
bureau

01:33:16.870 --> 01:33:16.880 align:start position:0%
bureau
 
01:33:18.390 --> 01:33:18.400 align:start position:0%
i think it's very important for you to
 
01:33:19.990 --> 01:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
know that
 
01:33:21.990 --> 01:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
so you have an understanding of why the
 
01:33:23.590 --> 01:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
this bill is so important to me but i
 
01:33:24.870 --> 01:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
also think it's important for you to
 
01:33:27.350 --> 01:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
know that i've i've taken time uh off
 
01:33:29.910 --> 01:33:29.920 align:start position:0%
today to be here uh i'm not here
 
01:33:31.270 --> 01:33:31.280 align:start position:0%
representing the division of state
 
01:33:33.350 --> 01:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
police i'm here representing myself uh
 
01:33:35.510 --> 01:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
but if not given the context it would i
 
01:33:36.870 --> 01:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
would certainly question why this
 
01:33:39.110 --> 01:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
individual was sitting before me
 
01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:39.830 align:start position:0%
individual was sitting before me
so

01:33:39.830 --> 01:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:33:41.110 --> 01:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
there's been
 
01:33:42.629 --> 01:33:42.639 align:start position:0%
numerous things that have been covered
 
01:33:45.830 --> 01:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
before uh my testimony so i will
 
01:33:47.910 --> 01:33:47.920 align:start position:0%
try and keep this as as condensed as
 
01:33:49.830 --> 01:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
possible but i'm i'm clearly very
 
01:33:51.750 --> 01:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
passionate about this this particular
 
01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:55.750 align:start position:0%
passionate about this this particular
build

01:33:55.750 --> 01:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:57.910 --> 01:33:57.920 align:start position:0%
i wanted to start by just saying to you
 
01:33:59.910 --> 01:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
i i began
 
01:34:02.870 --> 01:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
my career my professional career after
 
01:34:04.550 --> 01:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
graduate school i i went to work for a
 
01:34:06.950 --> 01:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
medical software company i was living in
 
01:34:09.189 --> 01:34:09.199 align:start position:0%
the metro boston area i felt like this
 
01:34:11.990 --> 01:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
was a uh this was a way to repay my my
 
01:34:13.990 --> 01:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
loans it certainly was
 
01:34:15.910 --> 01:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
but i felt unfulfilled with the
 
01:34:18.629 --> 01:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
the position it just it didn't seem to
 
01:34:21.189 --> 01:34:21.199 align:start position:0%
uh it didn't seem to fulfill
 
01:34:24.550 --> 01:34:24.560 align:start position:0%
what i thought was a noble profession
 
01:34:26.310 --> 01:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
nothing wrong with it just uh i felt
 
01:34:28.550 --> 01:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
like okay there's something bigger uh
 
01:34:30.390 --> 01:34:30.400 align:start position:0%
something different that i can do
 
01:34:32.629 --> 01:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
so i began the process to become a new
 
01:34:34.470 --> 01:34:34.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire state trooper
 
01:34:37.510 --> 01:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
i am incredibly glad grateful uh and
 
01:34:39.590 --> 01:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
humbled to have been
 
01:34:41.109 --> 01:34:41.119 align:start position:0%
part of the division for
 
01:34:43.669 --> 01:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
nearly 20 years now
 
01:34:46.390 --> 01:34:46.400 align:start position:0%
and i left my job in medical software i
 
01:34:49.270 --> 01:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
came home to the state of new hampshire
 
01:34:50.709 --> 01:34:50.719 align:start position:0%
and i did that based on a number of
 
01:34:53.270 --> 01:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
different factors i did that because i
 
01:34:53.280 --> 01:34:54.070 align:start position:0%
different factors i did that because i
felt

01:34:54.070 --> 01:34:54.080 align:start position:0%
felt
 
01:34:56.470 --> 01:34:56.480 align:start position:0%
most importantly like this was a noble
 
01:34:59.270 --> 01:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
profession that i could make an impact
 
01:35:01.510 --> 01:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
on not just my community but my state my
 
01:35:03.590 --> 01:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
home state
 
01:35:07.030 --> 01:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
i also did that in part on the notion as
 
01:35:09.669 --> 01:35:09.679 align:start position:0%
i sat down and they
 
01:35:11.669 --> 01:35:11.679 align:start position:0%
gave you gave me my benefits package at
 
01:35:13.510 --> 01:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
the time they handed me a blue trifold
 
01:35:15.590 --> 01:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
that said this is your retirement in 20
 
01:35:17.030 --> 01:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
years from now these are the benefits
 
01:35:18.470 --> 01:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
that you'll get
 
01:35:19.669 --> 01:35:19.679 align:start position:0%
and i certainly took that into
 
01:35:21.669 --> 01:35:21.679 align:start position:0%
consideration it wasn't the only uh
 
01:35:23.189 --> 01:35:23.199 align:start position:0%
factor but i certainly took that into
 
01:35:25.189 --> 01:35:25.199 align:start position:0%
consideration that okay in 20 years i
 
01:35:27.109 --> 01:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
can start another career
 
01:35:28.950 --> 01:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
i'll be 45 years old i'm still very
 
01:35:31.669 --> 01:35:31.679 align:start position:0%
young i can i can move on and i can uh i
 
01:35:33.750 --> 01:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
can start anew
 
01:35:35.109 --> 01:35:35.119 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
01:35:38.390 --> 01:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
with that in mind i wanted to
 
01:35:40.870 --> 01:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
put in perspective where i was
 
01:35:43.510 --> 01:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
when the changes took place i had uh
 
01:35:45.750 --> 01:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
nine years and five months on so i fell
 
01:35:48.629 --> 01:35:48.639 align:start position:0%
about seven months short of the uh of
 
01:35:50.709 --> 01:35:50.719 align:start position:0%
the marker of being vested in the in the
 
01:35:52.629 --> 01:35:52.639 align:start position:0%
system um
 
01:35:54.070 --> 01:35:54.080 align:start position:0%
and that was uh
 
01:35:56.149 --> 01:35:56.159 align:start position:0%
that was really a difficult time for me
 
01:35:56.159 --> 01:35:56.950 align:start position:0%
that was really a difficult time for me
um

01:35:56.950 --> 01:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:58.229 --> 01:35:58.239 align:start position:0%
i don't want to rehash that there was
 
01:35:59.669 --> 01:35:59.679 align:start position:0%
certainly lots of testimony that
 
01:36:01.030 --> 01:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
happened at the time that people were
 
01:36:02.629 --> 01:36:02.639 align:start position:0%
very passionate about it i was very
 
01:36:04.550 --> 01:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
passionate about it
 
01:36:06.709 --> 01:36:06.719 align:start position:0%
but what i accepted was
 
01:36:09.669 --> 01:36:09.679 align:start position:0%
although i i didn't agree with it i
 
01:36:12.310 --> 01:36:12.320 align:start position:0%
understood the need to make the system
 
01:36:14.790 --> 01:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
uh foundationally sound nobody cares
 
01:36:16.950 --> 01:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
about the retirement system being
 
01:36:18.709 --> 01:36:18.719 align:start position:0%
financially sound more than those of us
 
01:36:20.390 --> 01:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
who are in it
 
01:36:21.750 --> 01:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
so i didn't agree with the way that it
 
01:36:24.390 --> 01:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
took place but i did on degree uh i did
 
01:36:26.390 --> 01:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
understand the reason that it was
 
01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:28.310 align:start position:0%
understand the reason that it was
happening

01:36:28.310 --> 01:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
happening
 
01:36:30.229 --> 01:36:30.239 align:start position:0%
so often times i i speak to people and
 
01:36:32.149 --> 01:36:32.159 align:start position:0%
they they ask me like what is the big
 
01:36:33.189 --> 01:36:33.199 align:start position:0%
deal like
 
01:36:35.350 --> 01:36:35.360 align:start position:0%
you're you're extended one year why is
 
01:36:37.750 --> 01:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
this uh an issue for you like just do
 
01:36:39.350 --> 01:36:39.360 align:start position:0%
one more year uh
 
01:36:40.790 --> 01:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
and i try and explain to them the
 
01:36:42.390 --> 01:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
difference between
 
01:36:45.430 --> 01:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
my profession what you've heard from uh
 
01:36:47.590 --> 01:36:47.600 align:start position:0%
a member of the correctional department
 
01:36:48.790 --> 01:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
and what you'll hear from other people
 
01:36:51.109 --> 01:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
who come behind me uh but my profession
 
01:36:54.070 --> 01:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
is not a nine-to-five job uh it is uh
 
01:36:55.590 --> 01:36:55.600 align:start position:0%
much different from that i was
 
01:36:57.430 --> 01:36:57.440 align:start position:0%
indoctrinated into that my first year in
 
01:36:59.030 --> 01:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
the state police where i was required to
 
01:37:01.109 --> 01:37:01.119 align:start position:0%
live in the barracks uh and move around
 
01:37:03.590 --> 01:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
the state uh and i enjoyed that it was a
 
01:37:05.189 --> 01:37:05.199 align:start position:0%
tremendous experience
 
01:37:08.550 --> 01:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
but from 2004 when i entered into the
 
01:37:11.750 --> 01:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
crisis negotiation unit and in 2008 when
 
01:37:13.350 --> 01:37:13.360 align:start position:0%
i entered into our major crime unit
 
01:37:16.790 --> 01:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
until present day i've been on call 365
 
01:37:18.229 --> 01:37:18.239 align:start position:0%
days a year
 
01:37:21.270 --> 01:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
seven days a week and uh that's part of
 
01:37:23.350 --> 01:37:23.360 align:start position:0%
the responsibility of the job so my
 
01:37:25.030 --> 01:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
phone rings in my current position
 
01:37:26.390 --> 01:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
overseeing the homicide unit the
 
01:37:28.149 --> 01:37:28.159 align:start position:0%
narcotics unit uh the cyber
 
01:37:30.790 --> 01:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
investigations unit uh our terrorism and
 
01:37:32.229 --> 01:37:32.239 align:start position:0%
intelligence unit
 
01:37:34.310 --> 01:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
my phone rings all night long all night
 
01:37:37.030 --> 01:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
long all day long uh i've accepted as is
 
01:37:39.590 --> 01:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
my family that when i'm at uh funerals
 
01:37:43.350 --> 01:37:43.360 align:start position:0%
weddings uh holidays vacations that when
 
01:37:45.750 --> 01:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
that phone rings it's my responsibility
 
01:37:48.470 --> 01:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
to pick up the phone and to ensure that
 
01:37:50.550 --> 01:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
if i have to respond i do and if i can
 
01:37:51.830 --> 01:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
deal with what needs to be dealt with
 
01:37:53.430 --> 01:37:53.440 align:start position:0%
over the phone that i do that and i step
 
01:37:55.270 --> 01:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
away from whatever i'm doing
 
01:37:57.030 --> 01:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
and i do that because the decisions that
 
01:37:59.189 --> 01:37:59.199 align:start position:0%
are going on are life and death
 
01:38:01.430 --> 01:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
decisions both for members of the public
 
01:38:04.390 --> 01:38:04.400 align:start position:0%
but also for uh my fellow troopers so i
 
01:38:07.270 --> 01:38:07.280 align:start position:0%
take that very seriously um
 
01:38:09.910 --> 01:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
i won't bore you with uh 20 years of
 
01:38:11.830 --> 01:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
what took place in my career
 
01:38:13.910 --> 01:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
but i will tell you that i've had
 
01:38:16.950 --> 01:38:16.960 align:start position:0%
occasion to be exposed to hiv a very
 
01:38:19.270 --> 01:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
difficult conversation to have with your
 
01:38:20.790 --> 01:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
spouse when
 
01:38:22.629 --> 01:38:22.639 align:start position:0%
you're trying to start a family and
 
01:38:24.470 --> 01:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
you're you're exposed to a blood-borne
 
01:38:27.990 --> 01:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
pathogen and as much as i want to say
 
01:38:29.750 --> 01:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
you know it was a unique situation it
 
01:38:31.669 --> 01:38:31.679 align:start position:0%
wasn't i was on the midnight shift with
 
01:38:34.149 --> 01:38:34.159 align:start position:0%
six other troopers at the time all six
 
01:38:36.950 --> 01:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
of them had been exposed to either hiv
 
01:38:38.709 --> 01:38:38.719 align:start position:0%
hepatitis or some other blood-borne
 
01:38:38.719 --> 01:38:39.750 align:start position:0%
hepatitis or some other blood-borne
pathogen

01:38:39.750 --> 01:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
pathogen
 
01:38:42.070 --> 01:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
from biting spitting fighting exchange
 
01:38:44.790 --> 01:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
of blood uh these are the things that uh
 
01:38:46.310 --> 01:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
that happen uh
 
01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:47.189 align:start position:0%
that happen uh
so

01:38:47.189 --> 01:38:47.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:38:49.270 --> 01:38:49.280 align:start position:0%
uh i've talked um
 
01:38:52.470 --> 01:38:52.480 align:start position:0%
in the senate about this as well um
 
01:38:54.470 --> 01:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
and i would share with you that i've
 
01:38:56.629 --> 01:38:56.639 align:start position:0%
dealt uh because of my career path i've
 
01:38:59.270 --> 01:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
dealt with more dead people dead
 
01:39:01.030 --> 01:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
children than i can
 
01:39:02.709 --> 01:39:02.719 align:start position:0%
even remember
 
01:39:03.510 --> 01:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
and i
 
01:39:05.189 --> 01:39:05.199 align:start position:0%
i will tell you that each one of those
 
01:39:07.830 --> 01:39:07.840 align:start position:0%
individuals that you have contact with
 
01:39:09.590 --> 01:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
each deceased individual and their
 
01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:10.550 align:start position:0%
each deceased individual and their
family

01:39:10.550 --> 01:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
family
 
01:39:12.390 --> 01:39:12.400 align:start position:0%
leaving and double mark
 
01:39:14.629 --> 01:39:14.639 align:start position:0%
on you as a person
 
01:39:16.950 --> 01:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
um and lastly you know i would just
 
01:39:19.430 --> 01:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
point out over the uh the 20-year period
 
01:39:21.510 --> 01:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
i've unfortunately had the occasion to
 
01:39:23.990 --> 01:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
to bury some of my friends
 
01:39:25.750 --> 01:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
those individuals who
 
01:39:27.590 --> 01:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
in the line of duty have given their
 
01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:28.950 align:start position:0%
in the line of duty have given their
life

01:39:28.950 --> 01:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
life
 
01:39:30.470 --> 01:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately
 
01:39:32.149 --> 01:39:32.159 align:start position:0%
in some circumstances have taken their
 
01:39:32.159 --> 01:39:33.189 align:start position:0%
in some circumstances have taken their
life

01:39:33.189 --> 01:39:33.199 align:start position:0%
life
 
01:39:36.870 --> 01:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
it's a difficult difficult career
 
01:39:38.870 --> 01:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
but what i want to point out to this
 
01:39:40.550 --> 01:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
committee what i really want to get
 
01:39:42.709 --> 01:39:42.719 align:start position:0%
across to you is i've never once asked
 
01:39:44.950 --> 01:39:44.960 align:start position:0%
for sympathy for the experiences that
 
01:39:45.990 --> 01:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
i've had
 
01:39:48.229 --> 01:39:48.239 align:start position:0%
because i truly believe that i knew
 
01:39:50.870 --> 01:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
going in the front door i knew what what
 
01:39:52.870 --> 01:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
i said i would do
 
01:39:54.390 --> 01:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
i knew that these things could happen
 
01:39:56.229 --> 01:39:56.239 align:start position:0%
and now at 25 years old i may not have
 
01:39:58.629 --> 01:39:58.639 align:start position:0%
envisioned that they would all happen uh
 
01:40:01.510 --> 01:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
but i knew the dangers of the job
 
01:40:03.350 --> 01:40:03.360 align:start position:0%
and i accepted that
 
01:40:03.360 --> 01:40:04.149 align:start position:0%
and i accepted that
and

01:40:04.149 --> 01:40:04.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:40:05.270 --> 01:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
you know it
 
01:40:07.910 --> 01:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
the retirement changes were so difficult
 
01:40:09.990 --> 01:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
for me because i felt like on those days
 
01:40:12.870 --> 01:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
when it was really really difficult when
 
01:40:14.870 --> 01:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
i was being asked to do something that i
 
01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:15.669 align:start position:0%
i was being asked to do something that i
knew

01:40:15.669 --> 01:40:15.679 align:start position:0%
knew
 
01:40:17.669 --> 01:40:17.679 align:start position:0%
was either going to put my life at great
 
01:40:19.109 --> 01:40:19.119 align:start position:0%
risk or put
 
01:40:21.510 --> 01:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
you know my mental health at great risk
 
01:40:23.590 --> 01:40:23.600 align:start position:0%
i knew it didn't matter i said i would
 
01:40:25.669 --> 01:40:25.679 align:start position:0%
do it so i would do it
 
01:40:27.109 --> 01:40:27.119 align:start position:0%
and i felt like when the retirement
 
01:40:29.109 --> 01:40:29.119 align:start position:0%
changes whether right or wrong
 
01:40:30.550 --> 01:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
came through
 
01:40:32.390 --> 01:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
when it became the really really tough
 
01:40:34.149 --> 01:40:34.159 align:start position:0%
day for the state
 
01:40:36.790 --> 01:40:36.800 align:start position:0%
instead of the state bearing that burden
 
01:40:39.270 --> 01:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of it was shifted to the employee
 
01:40:42.070 --> 01:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
uh and again i understand why it was
 
01:40:42.080 --> 01:40:43.030 align:start position:0%
uh and again i understand why it was
done

01:40:43.030 --> 01:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
done
 
01:40:45.109 --> 01:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
but it was it was difficult for me to
 
01:40:45.119 --> 01:40:47.270 align:start position:0%
but it was it was difficult for me to
internalize

01:40:47.270 --> 01:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
internalize
 
01:40:48.550 --> 01:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
01:40:50.550 --> 01:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
i you know one of the things that uh i
 
01:40:52.229 --> 01:40:52.239 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that i uh pointed
 
01:40:54.390 --> 01:40:54.400 align:start position:0%
out is i i think that this bill strikes
 
01:40:57.830 --> 01:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
a a real balance between uh the goal of
 
01:41:00.149 --> 01:41:00.159 align:start position:0%
keeping the system healthy and keeping
 
01:41:02.149 --> 01:41:02.159 align:start position:0%
the mental health uh
 
01:41:04.709 --> 01:41:04.719 align:start position:0%
of the employee healthy you've heard an
 
01:41:06.629 --> 01:41:06.639 align:start position:0%
awful lot about the fact that this is a
 
01:41:08.390 --> 01:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
retention bill i truly believe that it
 
01:41:10.390 --> 01:41:10.400 align:start position:0%
is for those troopers who are staring
 
01:41:11.910 --> 01:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
down nine more years who have the
 
01:41:14.229 --> 01:41:14.239 align:start position:0%
possibility of buying four and shrinking
 
01:41:16.790 --> 01:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
that this is truly a retention bill for
 
01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:17.750 align:start position:0%
that this is truly a retention bill for
them

01:41:17.750 --> 01:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:41:19.430 --> 01:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
for myself at the other end of the
 
01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:20.870 align:start position:0%
for myself at the other end of the
spectrum

01:41:20.870 --> 01:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
spectrum
 
01:41:23.189 --> 01:41:23.199 align:start position:0%
this isn't necessarily a a retention
 
01:41:24.870 --> 01:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
bill for me
 
01:41:27.510 --> 01:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
this is an opportunity to to leave and
 
01:41:29.669 --> 01:41:29.679 align:start position:0%
be with my family
 
01:41:31.430 --> 01:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
i leave you with this that i
 
01:41:33.910 --> 01:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
for the last 20 years i've prided myself
 
01:41:36.229 --> 01:41:36.239 align:start position:0%
on putting the state of new hampshire
 
01:41:38.629 --> 01:41:38.639 align:start position:0%
and the division of state police first
 
01:41:38.639 --> 01:41:39.750 align:start position:0%
and the division of state police first
whenever

01:41:39.750 --> 01:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
whenever
 
01:41:42.709 --> 01:41:42.719 align:start position:0%
the phone rang i went and sometimes
 
01:41:42.719 --> 01:41:44.870 align:start position:0%
the phone rang i went and sometimes
begrudgingly

01:41:44.870 --> 01:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
begrudgingly
 
01:41:47.109 --> 01:41:47.119 align:start position:0%
but i always went i never turned away
 
01:41:49.030 --> 01:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
from the duty that i said that i would
 
01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:50.070 align:start position:0%
from the duty that i said that i would
do

01:41:50.070 --> 01:41:50.080 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:41:51.750 --> 01:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
but i would ask that you consider
 
01:41:54.390 --> 01:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
passage of this bill uh and return to me
 
01:41:57.590 --> 01:41:57.600 align:start position:0%

around law enforcement my father
 
01:43:25.910 --> 01:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
uncles uh my brother is a current uh my
 
01:43:27.830 --> 01:43:27.840 align:start position:0%

middle group as am i and many other
 
01:43:33.669 --> 01:43:33.679 align:start position:0%
people i work with
 
01:43:36.149 --> 01:43:36.159 align:start position:0%
uh so you can say it runs in the blood
 
01:43:39.669 --> 01:43:39.679 align:start position:0%
uh when it comes to my family
 
01:43:41.430 --> 01:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
we obviously have a lot of friends in
 
01:43:43.350 --> 01:43:43.360 align:start position:0%
law enforcement i've grown up growing up
 
01:43:45.189 --> 01:43:45.199 align:start position:0%
with them and one thing i've noticed
 
01:43:47.109 --> 01:43:47.119 align:start position:0%
over the years is that people came from
 
01:43:48.629 --> 01:43:48.639 align:start position:0%
all over the country to come work in new
 
01:43:51.910 --> 01:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire arizona new york florida texas
 
01:43:53.270 --> 01:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
i've known people from all over the
 
01:43:54.950 --> 01:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
country who came and worked in new
 
01:43:56.790 --> 01:43:56.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire i believe that's largely
 
01:43:58.470 --> 01:43:58.480 align:start position:0%
because of the benefits new hampshire
 
01:44:01.350 --> 01:44:01.360 align:start position:0%
offered in the retirement system
 
01:44:02.950 --> 01:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
you don't see that anymore i think that
 
01:44:05.430 --> 01:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
the instability of the retirement system
 
01:44:08.550 --> 01:44:08.560 align:start position:0%
and the unpredictability has affected
 
01:44:10.629 --> 01:44:10.639 align:start position:0%
uh people coming to work in new
 
01:44:10.639 --> 01:44:11.990 align:start position:0%
uh people coming to work in new
hampshire

01:44:11.990 --> 01:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:44:13.590 --> 01:44:13.600 align:start position:0%
and you talk about
 
01:44:15.350 --> 01:44:15.360 align:start position:0%
recruitment i think that's a large part
 
01:44:16.790 --> 01:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
of it i know that's one of the reasons i
 
01:44:19.030 --> 01:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to come into this line of line of
 
01:44:21.350 --> 01:44:21.360 align:start position:0%
work i'm not sure that i would want to
 
01:44:23.350 --> 01:44:23.360 align:start position:0%
if i knew then what i knew now i'm not
 
01:44:24.709 --> 01:44:24.719 align:start position:0%
sure that i would want to be in this
 
01:44:26.709 --> 01:44:26.719 align:start position:0%
line of work because some of the things
 
01:44:28.149 --> 01:44:28.159 align:start position:0%
i've had to deal with and my family's
 
01:44:30.470 --> 01:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
dealt with in their career but
 
01:44:34.550 --> 01:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
i do think recruitment retention is is
 
01:44:37.109 --> 01:44:37.119 align:start position:0%
is a main part of this
 
01:44:39.030 --> 01:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
of this build
 
01:44:41.430 --> 01:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
uh i was still young i had about five or
 
01:44:43.189 --> 01:44:43.199 align:start position:0%
six years on the job when when all these
 
01:44:44.870 --> 01:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
conversations initially took place and
 
01:44:47.270 --> 01:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
the change took place in 2012
 
01:44:48.950 --> 01:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
i wasn't as involved as i should have
 
01:44:50.310 --> 01:44:50.320 align:start position:0%
been or would have liked to have been
 
01:44:53.109 --> 01:44:53.119 align:start position:0%
but i had i was young and dumb and had a
 
01:44:55.430 --> 01:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
young family you know my my first
 
01:44:57.030 --> 01:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
marriage was deteriorating because of
 
01:44:58.310 --> 01:44:58.320 align:start position:0%
the hours that i was working at the
 
01:45:01.430 --> 01:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
prison largely not not all but largely
 
01:45:03.430 --> 01:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
because of the crazy schedule i think we
 
01:45:05.430 --> 01:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
all know about the
 
01:45:11.430 --> 01:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:11.440 --> 01:45:15.109 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

01:45:15.109 --> 01:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:17.910 --> 01:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
but in recent years i've educated myself
 
01:45:19.990 --> 01:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
more and more about the issues that led
 
01:45:21.590 --> 01:45:21.600 align:start position:0%
up to that and the possible reasons for
 
01:45:24.229 --> 01:45:24.239 align:start position:0%
the proposed changes and what eventually
 
01:45:25.590 --> 01:45:25.600 align:start position:0%
changed and
 
01:45:28.310 --> 01:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
i i can say that i understand them
 
01:45:31.510 --> 01:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
i i almost i almost understand them um
 
01:45:34.149 --> 01:45:34.159 align:start position:0%
and then one thing always strikes me uh
 
01:45:36.229 --> 01:45:36.239 align:start position:0%
something that i deal with in my role as
 
01:45:36.239 --> 01:45:36.950 align:start position:0%
something that i deal with in my role as
a

01:45:36.950 --> 01:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:45:39.270 --> 01:45:39.280 align:start position:0%
as a president of a union and that is
 
01:45:41.430 --> 01:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
what's right is right when you deal with
 
01:45:43.270 --> 01:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
any issue or any
 
01:45:45.350 --> 01:45:45.360 align:start position:0%
take a position or any fight you you
 
01:45:47.830 --> 01:45:47.840 align:start position:0%
look at it is this a reasonable
 
01:45:49.669 --> 01:45:49.679 align:start position:0%
situation is is what we're looking for
 
01:45:52.070 --> 01:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
reasonable and is it right and i believe
 
01:45:55.430 --> 01:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
this bill is right it doesn't correct
 
01:45:58.149 --> 01:45:58.159 align:start position:0%
um what many of us feel is was the wrong
 
01:46:00.229 --> 01:46:00.239 align:start position:0%
done to us in 2012 but i think it's a
 
01:46:02.070 --> 01:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
step in the right direction for
 
01:46:04.870 --> 01:46:04.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of um reasons which
 
01:46:08.790 --> 01:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
have already been spoken to today so
 
01:46:12.310 --> 01:46:12.320 align:start position:0%
um with that i leave you i i do want to
 
01:46:13.590 --> 01:46:13.600 align:start position:0%
mention that i think new hampshire's
 
01:46:13.600 --> 01:46:15.430 align:start position:0%
mention that i think new hampshire's
been

01:46:15.430 --> 01:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:46:17.750 --> 01:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
lucky enough not to be in some of these
 
01:46:19.430 --> 01:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
national headlines over the last few
 
01:46:21.669 --> 01:46:21.679 align:start position:0%
years and i think the recruitment that
 
01:46:23.669 --> 01:46:23.679 align:start position:0%
people that have been attracted to new
 
01:46:23.679 --> 01:46:24.950 align:start position:0%
people that have been attracted to new
hampshire

01:46:24.950 --> 01:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:46:26.950 --> 01:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
law enforcement specifically is a large
 
01:46:29.270 --> 01:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
reason for that so
 
01:46:30.870 --> 01:46:30.880 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the time and i'll take
 
01:46:32.550 --> 01:46:32.560 align:start position:0%

01:47:14.709 --> 01:47:14.719 align:start position:0%
last one was obvious
 
01:47:15.990 --> 01:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
that's all right
 
01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:17.350 align:start position:0%

01:47:20.229 --> 01:47:20.239 align:start position:0%
currently i'm the president of uh chief
 
01:47:21.990 --> 01:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
prohibition parole officers in state of
 
01:47:23.590 --> 01:47:23.600 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:25.350 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
um

01:47:25.350 --> 01:47:25.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:27.750 --> 01:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
i am also a
 
01:47:30.310 --> 01:47:30.320 align:start position:0%
taxpayer and resident of this state and
 
01:47:32.870 --> 01:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
i have done so for a little over 20
 
01:47:35.189 --> 01:47:35.199 align:start position:0%
years now
 
01:47:37.350 --> 01:47:37.360 align:start position:0%
the question before us is about this
 
01:47:37.360 --> 01:47:38.870 align:start position:0%
the question before us is about this
bill

01:47:38.870 --> 01:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:47:41.350 --> 01:47:41.360 align:start position:0%
do i support this bill
 
01:47:43.830 --> 01:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
yes i support this bill
 
01:47:45.990 --> 01:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
do i support it because this is the best
 
01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:46.950 align:start position:0%
do i support it because this is the best
bill

01:47:46.950 --> 01:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:47:49.510 --> 01:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
that would restore what was taken away
 
01:47:52.310 --> 01:47:52.320 align:start position:0%
from the hard and dedicated
 
01:47:54.070 --> 01:47:54.080 align:start position:0%
first responders
 
01:47:57.990 --> 01:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
no really as representative scitec
 
01:48:00.390 --> 01:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
uh stated that is this bill even a fair
 
01:48:00.400 --> 01:48:02.070 align:start position:0%
uh stated that is this bill even a fair
bill

01:48:02.070 --> 01:48:02.080 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:48:05.510 --> 01:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
would this give the ability for members
 
01:48:07.990 --> 01:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
equally to purchase the time the answer
 
01:48:08.950 --> 01:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
is no
 
01:48:11.270 --> 01:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
but this bill is better than
 
01:48:13.430 --> 01:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
what is the current practice in this
 
01:48:13.440 --> 01:48:14.550 align:start position:0%
what is the current practice in this
state

01:48:14.550 --> 01:48:14.560 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:48:17.910 --> 01:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
i am similarly to the police officer a
 
01:48:20.950 --> 01:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
representative sciatic mentioned
 
01:48:23.430 --> 01:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
i was two months away from my
 
01:48:26.709 --> 01:48:26.719 align:start position:0%
being vested when they changed this law
 
01:48:29.590 --> 01:48:29.600 align:start position:0%
so when we talk about fairness is this
 
01:48:33.510 --> 01:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
fair to ask the member to pay 40 000
 
01:48:35.669 --> 01:48:35.679 align:start position:0%
the question will be also was it fair to
 
01:48:37.109 --> 01:48:37.119 align:start position:0%
change the law
 
01:48:39.830 --> 01:48:39.840 align:start position:0%
uh against individuals who are promised
 
01:48:41.109 --> 01:48:41.119 align:start position:0%
to do something
 
01:48:42.950 --> 01:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
who are told you can retire at the age
 
01:48:45.189 --> 01:48:45.199 align:start position:0%
of 45 or 20
 
01:48:47.910 --> 01:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
but then midway through their career
 
01:48:50.629 --> 01:48:50.639 align:start position:0%
change it and retroactively
 
01:48:52.950 --> 01:48:52.960 align:start position:0%
affect those members
 
01:48:55.830 --> 01:48:55.840 align:start position:0%
that wasn't fair either so we are we're
 
01:48:57.270 --> 01:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
caught in
 
01:49:00.390 --> 01:49:00.400 align:start position:0%
that dilemma
 
01:49:02.470 --> 01:49:02.480 align:start position:0%
yes it would give us the opportunity to
 
01:49:03.750 --> 01:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
buy the time
 
01:49:06.709 --> 01:49:06.719 align:start position:0%
it will also help with retention
 
01:49:08.950 --> 01:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
of those who would leave otherwise and
 
01:49:11.270 --> 01:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
i'll tell you i have members who have
 
01:49:13.990 --> 01:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
currently served the state for 17 or 16
 
01:49:17.589 --> 01:49:17.599 align:start position:0%
years and looking into some form of
 
01:49:19.350 --> 01:49:19.360 align:start position:0%
private sector job which gives them the
 
01:49:21.510 --> 01:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
flexibility to work from home from
 
01:49:24.390 --> 01:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
remote area and often time i hear why
 
01:49:26.629 --> 01:49:26.639 align:start position:0%
would you do it you already have 16
 
01:49:26.639 --> 01:49:28.310 align:start position:0%
would you do it you already have 16
years

01:49:28.310 --> 01:49:28.320 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:49:31.109 --> 01:49:31.119 align:start position:0%
and the answer i always get is that
 
01:49:31.119 --> 01:49:32.310 align:start position:0%
and the answer i always get is that
no

01:49:32.310 --> 01:49:32.320 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:49:35.350 --> 01:49:35.360 align:start position:0%
the other years have really
 
01:49:37.990 --> 01:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
contributed to this thrust level that i
 
01:49:39.910 --> 01:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
have about the system
 
01:49:41.910 --> 01:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
so would you serve us a retention yeah
 
01:49:44.390 --> 01:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
it would at least those people say okay
 
01:49:46.870 --> 01:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
i can at least retire in a time frame i
 
01:49:49.270 --> 01:49:49.280 align:start position:0%
was promised even though
 
01:49:52.070 --> 01:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
even though it's going to be costly for
 
01:49:52.080 --> 01:49:53.510 align:start position:0%
even though it's going to be costly for
me

01:49:53.510 --> 01:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:49:56.149 --> 01:49:56.159 align:start position:0%
even though the individual will bear the
 
01:49:58.229 --> 01:49:58.239 align:start position:0%
responsibility of paying hundred percent
 
01:49:59.990 --> 01:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
of that contribution
 
01:50:03.109 --> 01:50:03.119 align:start position:0%
but at least that person can retire as
 
01:50:06.149 --> 01:50:06.159 align:start position:0%
promised that's the only benefit
 
01:50:06.159 --> 01:50:06.950 align:start position:0%
promised that's the only benefit
so

01:50:06.950 --> 01:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:50:10.790 --> 01:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
for many reasons uh that i would support
 
01:50:12.149 --> 01:50:12.159 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:50:13.990 --> 01:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
i'm not happy about it
 
01:50:15.589 --> 01:50:15.599 align:start position:0%
the fact the cost
 
01:50:17.270 --> 01:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
that is from the employee hundred
 
01:50:17.280 --> 01:50:18.709 align:start position:0%
that is from the employee hundred
percent

01:50:18.709 --> 01:50:18.719 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:50:18.719 --> 01:50:19.510 align:start position:0%
percent
is

01:50:19.510 --> 01:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:50:21.830 --> 01:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
another challenge for us
 
01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:23.189 align:start position:0%
another challenge for us
and

01:50:23.189 --> 01:50:23.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:50:25.189 --> 01:50:25.199 align:start position:0%
but i have to say that it is better than
 
01:50:27.189 --> 01:50:27.199 align:start position:0%
what the current practice is and that's
 
01:50:29.030 --> 01:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
why we you all heard it from us you
 
01:50:31.350 --> 01:50:31.360 align:start position:0%
heard from the correctional officer the
 
01:50:33.270 --> 01:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
police officer the probation officer
 
01:50:34.950 --> 01:50:34.960 align:start position:0%
you're hearing it from me
 
01:50:37.189 --> 01:50:37.199 align:start position:0%
we're not highly enthusiastic about this
 
01:50:39.589 --> 01:50:39.599 align:start position:0%
bill wow it's going to fix everything
 
01:50:42.070 --> 01:50:42.080 align:start position:0%
but it is it will be different than
 
01:50:44.070 --> 01:50:44.080 align:start position:0%
what the current practice is which lifts
 
01:50:45.990 --> 01:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
a bad eastern or mouse
 
01:50:48.629 --> 01:50:48.639 align:start position:0%
so that's all i have okay thank you very
 
01:50:50.390 --> 01:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony are there any
 
01:50:50.400 --> 01:50:53.189 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony are there any
questions

01:50:53.189 --> 01:50:53.199 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:50:54.950 --> 01:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
i think we're you think you covered it
 
01:50:56.550 --> 01:50:56.560 align:start position:0%
very well all right
 
01:50:58.629 --> 01:50:58.639 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:51:02.229 --> 01:51:02.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:03.910 --> 01:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
and i do hope you don't plan to take
 
01:51:08.390 --> 01:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:12.790 --> 01:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:15.030 --> 01:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
my name is michael gea geha i'm
 
01:51:16.390 --> 01:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
president of the new hampshire police
 
01:51:18.310 --> 01:51:18.320 align:start position:0%
association i'm also a detective with
 
01:51:19.430 --> 01:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
the salem new hampshire police
 
01:51:19.440 --> 01:51:20.629 align:start position:0%
the salem new hampshire police
department

01:51:20.629 --> 01:51:20.639 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:51:21.990 --> 01:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
you have heard several times this
 
01:51:23.510 --> 01:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
session that the state of new hampshire
 
01:51:25.990 --> 01:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
and just about every city and town are
 
01:51:28.229 --> 01:51:28.239 align:start position:0%
facing serious employment challenges in
 
01:51:30.149 --> 01:51:30.159 align:start position:0%
the public safety area
 
01:51:32.149 --> 01:51:32.159 align:start position:0%
especially law enforcement
 
01:51:34.229 --> 01:51:34.239 align:start position:0%
state police now have 61 unfilled
 
01:51:35.910 --> 01:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
openings and local communities are
 
01:51:37.750 --> 01:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
finding the applicant pool to be
 
01:51:40.070 --> 01:51:40.080 align:start position:0%
extremely tight
 
01:51:42.149 --> 01:51:42.159 align:start position:0%
with that cities and towns are competing
 
01:51:44.310 --> 01:51:44.320 align:start position:0%
against each other for not only new
 
01:51:46.470 --> 01:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
hires but in retaining existing
 
01:51:46.480 --> 01:51:48.070 align:start position:0%
hires but in retaining existing
personnel

01:51:48.070 --> 01:51:48.080 align:start position:0%
personnel
 
01:51:49.990 --> 01:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
competition from the private sector and
 
01:51:52.229 --> 01:51:52.239 align:start position:0%
in some cases outright burnout are
 
01:51:54.149 --> 01:51:54.159 align:start position:0%
adding to this very concerning public
 
01:51:55.830 --> 01:51:55.840 align:start position:0%
safety problem
 
01:51:57.669 --> 01:51:57.679 align:start position:0%
we are now experiencing an out of the
 
01:51:59.990 --> 01:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
ordinary trend with a growing number of
 
01:52:02.070 --> 01:52:02.080 align:start position:0%
employees who are leaving before they
 
01:52:05.030 --> 01:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
even reach their 20 or 25 years
 
01:52:06.709 --> 01:52:06.719 align:start position:0%
that is something none of us could have
 
01:52:09.510 --> 01:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
contemplated just a couple of years ago
 
01:52:13.109 --> 01:52:13.119 align:start position:0%
sb 363 is a small tool that will help in
 
01:52:15.270 --> 01:52:15.280 align:start position:0%
retaining some individuals who might be
 
01:52:17.910 --> 01:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
thinking about leaving early
 
01:52:20.550 --> 01:52:20.560 align:start position:0%
and quite frankly the economics makes
 
01:52:22.629 --> 01:52:22.639 align:start position:0%
sense local communities spend on average
 
01:52:24.310 --> 01:52:24.320 align:start position:0%
approximately fifty to seventy five
 
01:52:26.870 --> 01:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars to train and equip each
 
01:52:28.390 --> 01:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
new police officer
 
01:52:30.229 --> 01:52:30.239 align:start position:0%
each time one leaves the new hire
 
01:52:33.350 --> 01:52:33.360 align:start position:0%
training costs hit the local budget
 
01:52:35.270 --> 01:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
i realize this bill isn't for everyone
 
01:52:37.030 --> 01:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
but for the small number in the middle
 
01:52:39.189 --> 01:52:39.199 align:start position:0%
tier who have the money to buy years to
 
01:52:42.709 --> 01:52:42.719 align:start position:0%
get them down to the 20th period
 
01:52:44.709 --> 01:52:44.719 align:start position:0%
when they were hired under
 
01:52:46.950 --> 01:52:46.960 align:start position:0%
this may help keep them in in their
 
01:52:49.350 --> 01:52:49.360 align:start position:0%
position longer rather than leaving
 
01:52:51.350 --> 01:52:51.360 align:start position:0%
early this bill was amended in the
 
01:52:53.669 --> 01:52:53.679 align:start position:0%
senate to clarify that the entire cost
 
01:52:56.550 --> 01:52:56.560 align:start position:0%
would be covered by employees there is
 
01:52:58.229 --> 01:52:58.239 align:start position:0%
no cost to the state or local
 
01:52:58.239 --> 01:52:59.910 align:start position:0%
no cost to the state or local
communities

01:52:59.910 --> 01:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
communities
 
01:53:01.589 --> 01:53:01.599 align:start position:0%
we need to do everything possible to
 
01:53:03.750 --> 01:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
encourage individuals to work their full
 
01:53:05.830 --> 01:53:05.840 align:start position:0%
pre-retirement term
 
01:53:07.750 --> 01:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
and we need to do everything possible to
 
01:53:09.350 --> 01:53:09.360 align:start position:0%
make sure the citizens of the state
 
01:53:11.189 --> 01:53:11.199 align:start position:0%
receive the law enforcement protection
 
01:53:12.550 --> 01:53:12.560 align:start position:0%
that is needed
 
01:53:14.390 --> 01:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
as well as they deserve
 
01:53:16.790 --> 01:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
this bill will help help accomplish
 
01:53:20.070 --> 01:53:20.080 align:start position:0%
those goals i was hired back in 1999 and
 
01:53:21.990 --> 01:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
i get asked this question all the time
 
01:53:24.629 --> 01:53:24.639 align:start position:0%
why are you still here and my answer is
 
01:53:28.390 --> 01:53:28.400 align:start position:0%

of these is in my district in greenland
 
01:56:41.030 --> 01:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
novel ironworks i had a tour of this
 
01:56:43.109 --> 01:56:43.119 align:start position:0%
complex followed by a discussion with
 
01:56:45.270 --> 01:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
holly navaletsky the owner and ceo of
 
01:56:46.709 --> 01:56:46.719 align:start position:0%
the company

these companies are responsible
 
01:56:50.870 --> 01:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
employers with dedicated employees but
 
01:56:52.229 --> 01:56:52.239 align:start position:0%
they are competing with foreign

manufacturers for work in new hampshire
 
01:56:56.550 --> 01:56:56.560 align:start position:0%
and across new england i learned that
 
01:56:58.629 --> 01:56:58.639 align:start position:0%
the playing field is anything but level
 
01:57:00.550 --> 01:57:00.560 align:start position:0%
with many of these foreign producers due
 
01:57:02.629 --> 01:57:02.639 align:start position:0%
to government support favorable tax
 
01:57:05.750 --> 01:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
structures or and or exchange rates able
 
01:57:07.510 --> 01:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
to offer their products at such low
 
01:57:09.189 --> 01:57:09.199 align:start position:0%
prices that our own in-state
 
01:57:11.910 --> 01:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
manufacturers cannot compete
 
01:57:13.990 --> 01:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
our granite state fabricators have
 
01:57:15.830 --> 01:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
compelling stories of being unable to
 
01:57:18.070 --> 01:57:18.080 align:start position:0%
bid for contracts even in the cities and
 
01:57:19.990 --> 01:57:20.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities in which their factories
 
01:57:21.430 --> 01:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
are located
 
01:57:24.470 --> 01:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
the concept behind this bill is not new
 
01:57:26.550 --> 01:57:26.560 align:start position:0%
it is standard of practice for federal
 
01:57:28.629 --> 01:57:28.639 align:start position:0%
highway projects
 
01:57:30.390 --> 01:57:30.400 align:start position:0%
recently there's been a movement in
 
01:57:32.470 --> 01:57:32.480 align:start position:0%
state legislatures across the country to
 
01:57:34.070 --> 01:57:34.080 align:start position:0%
level the playing field to support
 
01:57:36.709 --> 01:57:36.719 align:start position:0%
american-made products by ensuring that
 
01:57:38.870 --> 01:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
they are utilized in these publicly in
 
01:57:41.430 --> 01:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
publicly funded projects
 
01:57:43.109 --> 01:57:43.119 align:start position:0%
one critical lesson we have learned
 
01:57:44.629 --> 01:57:44.639 align:start position:0%
during covitt is the price of
 
01:57:46.950 --> 01:57:46.960 align:start position:0%
outsourcing manufacturing behind beyond
 
01:57:48.870 --> 01:57:48.880 align:start position:0%
us borders
 
01:57:51.750 --> 01:57:51.760 align:start position:0%
whether it was ppe plexiglas ventilators
 
01:57:53.270 --> 01:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
or other products essential to
 
01:57:55.189 --> 01:57:55.199 align:start position:0%
protecting the health of americans
 
01:57:56.950 --> 01:57:56.960 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic
 
01:57:58.790 --> 01:57:58.800 align:start position:0%
lack of availability within the united
 
01:58:00.950 --> 01:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
states created significant barriers to
 
01:58:03.030 --> 01:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
access during the crisis
 
01:58:05.270 --> 01:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
and persistent broad foreign supply
 
01:58:07.830 --> 01:58:07.840 align:start position:0%
chain shortages continue to drive up
 
01:58:10.390 --> 01:58:10.400 align:start position:0%
consumer prices here at home
 
01:58:12.870 --> 01:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
supporting u.s based manufacturing as
 
01:58:14.950 --> 01:58:14.960 align:start position:0%
anticipated in this bill ensures that
 
01:58:17.030 --> 01:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
there will be a high quality production
 
01:58:19.910 --> 01:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
on american soil supports local job
 
01:58:22.390 --> 01:58:22.400 align:start position:0%
growth with excellent wages and benefits
 
01:58:24.709 --> 01:58:24.719 align:start position:0%
and represents a direct investment in
 
01:58:27.510 --> 01:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
our own businesses and economy
 
01:58:29.430 --> 01:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
while some may claim that this might
 
01:58:32.229 --> 01:58:32.239 align:start position:0%
drive up costs at least 21 states have
 
01:58:34.229 --> 01:58:34.239 align:start position:0%
laws that require government preference
 
01:58:37.109 --> 01:58:37.119 align:start position:0%
for american-made materials and products
 
01:58:39.589 --> 01:58:39.599 align:start position:0%
38 states have in-state procurement
 
01:58:42.390 --> 01:58:42.400 align:start position:0%
preferences for manufacturers and
 
01:58:44.790 --> 01:58:44.800 align:start position:0%
specifically every one dollar spent on
 
01:58:47.589 --> 01:58:47.599 align:start position:0%
domestic fabricated steel has generated
 
01:58:50.310 --> 01:58:50.320 align:start position:0%
about 1.50 in subsequent economic
 
01:58:50.320 --> 01:58:51.750 align:start position:0%
about 1.50 in subsequent economic
activity

01:58:51.750 --> 01:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
activity
 
01:58:53.910 --> 01:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
similar legislation passed recently in
 
01:58:56.470 --> 01:58:56.480 align:start position:0%
new jersey and did so unanimously in the
 
01:58:59.189 --> 01:58:59.199 align:start position:0%
texas legislature
 
01:59:00.830 --> 01:59:00.840 align:start position:0%
it's now under consideration
 
01:59:03.589 --> 01:59:03.599 align:start position:0%
massachusetts and interestingly
 
01:59:05.750 --> 01:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
countries that represent current foreign
 
01:59:07.750 --> 01:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
sources of similar products allow their
 
01:59:10.310 --> 01:59:10.320 align:start position:0%
regional governments and provinces to
 
01:59:12.790 --> 01:59:12.800 align:start position:0%
pass the exact same type of guard rails
 
01:59:14.950 --> 01:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
contemplated in this bill to support
 
01:59:17.109 --> 01:59:17.119 align:start position:0%
their own local industries
 
01:59:19.189 --> 01:59:19.199 align:start position:0%
this is not simply a matter of new
 
01:59:21.270 --> 01:59:21.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire jobs and businesses it has
 
01:59:23.830 --> 01:59:23.840 align:start position:0%
grown in my estimation to be an issue of
 
01:59:26.229 --> 01:59:26.239 align:start position:0%
national economic security and
 
01:59:26.239 --> 01:59:28.310 align:start position:0%
national economic security and
independence

01:59:28.310 --> 01:59:28.320 align:start position:0%
independence
 
01:59:31.189 --> 01:59:31.199 align:start position:0%
in the senate after introducing sb 438
 
01:59:32.870 --> 01:59:32.880 align:start position:0%
and hearing the testimony from the
 
01:59:34.629 --> 01:59:34.639 align:start position:0%
contractors and from the municipal
 
01:59:37.189 --> 01:59:37.199 align:start position:0%
association as well as many others we
 
01:59:39.910 --> 01:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
sat down as a group
 
01:59:42.830 --> 01:59:42.840 align:start position:0%
and this was attended by the chair
 
01:59:45.669 --> 01:59:45.679 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:59:47.430 --> 01:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
amended the bill to what you have before
 
01:59:49.669 --> 01:59:49.679 align:start position:0%
you today all stakeholders have signed
 
01:59:51.350 --> 01:59:51.360 align:start position:0%
off on this bill and it's much better
 
01:59:53.669 --> 01:59:53.679 align:start position:0%
than what i introduced which is so often
 
01:59:55.990 --> 01:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
the case here in the legislature
 
01:59:58.390 --> 01:59:58.400 align:start position:0%
we refined the definition to be more
 
02:00:01.109 --> 02:00:01.119 align:start position:0%
specific we put in place metrics for
 
02:00:03.030 --> 02:00:03.040 align:start position:0%
implementation as well as a waiver
 
02:00:05.589 --> 02:00:05.599 align:start position:0%
process and we made sure that compliance
 
02:00:08.390 --> 02:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
and accountability had some teeth using
 
02:00:10.310 --> 02:00:10.320 align:start position:0%
standard language from the department of
 
02:00:12.149 --> 02:00:12.159 align:start position:0%
revenue administration for similar
 
02:00:12.159 --> 02:00:13.830 align:start position:0%
revenue administration for similar
processes

02:00:13.830 --> 02:00:13.840 align:start position:0%
processes
 
02:00:15.830 --> 02:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
while allowing for appropriate exemption
 
02:00:17.430 --> 02:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:00:19.830 --> 02:00:19.840 align:start position:0%
requires the state to reinvest taxpayer
 
02:00:21.990 --> 02:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
dollars in our own local regional and
 
02:00:23.750 --> 02:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
statewide economies
 
02:00:25.510 --> 02:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
please join me in supporting the
 
02:00:27.430 --> 02:00:27.440 align:start position:0%
strategic investment in new hampshire
 
02:00:30.070 --> 02:00:30.080 align:start position:0%
businesses employees and communities by
 
02:00:32.149 --> 02:00:32.159 align:start position:0%
voting ought to pass on this buy

uh thank you senator for coming to us

today as you know i grew up in the city
 
02:00:47.830 --> 02:00:47.840 align:start position:0%
of pittsburgh and did a little studying
 
02:00:49.589 --> 02:00:49.599 align:start position:0%
of the steel industry like most people
 
02:00:51.510 --> 02:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
growing up in the city of pittsburgh did
 
02:00:53.270 --> 02:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
do we actually have smelters in new
 
02:00:54.629 --> 02:00:54.639 align:start position:0%
hampshire or are they just still
 
02:00:54.639 --> 02:00:56.390 align:start position:0%
hampshire or are they just still
fabricators

02:00:56.390 --> 02:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
fabricators
 
02:00:59.750 --> 02:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
um that's beyond my pay grade but i
 
02:01:01.430 --> 02:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
there are people here from all of the
 
02:01:04.070 --> 02:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
fabricator companies and they can answer
 
02:01:04.080 --> 02:01:04.870 align:start position:0%
fabricator companies and they can answer
that

02:01:04.870 --> 02:01:04.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:01:07.189 --> 02:01:07.199 align:start position:0%
question sorry excellent
 
02:01:09.270 --> 02:01:09.280 align:start position:0%
can i ask another question madam chair
 
02:01:12.070 --> 02:01:12.080 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up question did uh the
 
02:01:14.229 --> 02:01:14.239 align:start position:0%
senate receive any input from the
 
02:01:16.550 --> 02:01:16.560 align:start position:0%
canadian consul general and fabricating
 
02:01:18.149 --> 02:01:18.159 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:01:20.950 --> 02:01:20.960 align:start position:0%
nice nice choice of words um
 
02:01:23.589 --> 02:01:23.599 align:start position:0%
the bill was fabricate i
 
02:01:25.750 --> 02:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
do believe i'd have to go back and look
 
02:01:27.270 --> 02:01:27.280 align:start position:0%
at the committee report but i do think
 
02:01:28.790 --> 02:01:28.800 align:start position:0%
the canadian
 
02:01:30.709 --> 02:01:30.719 align:start position:0%
there was uh someone testifying on
 
02:01:33.830 --> 02:01:33.840 align:start position:0%
behalf of canada there thank you
 
02:01:33.840 --> 02:01:35.830 align:start position:0%
behalf of canada there thank you
representative

02:01:35.830 --> 02:01:35.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:01:38.310 --> 02:01:38.320 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you senator
 
02:01:41.990 --> 02:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
um i see that it this bill reef
 
02:01:43.589 --> 02:01:43.599 align:start position:0%
refers to
 
02:01:46.790 --> 02:01:46.800 align:start position:0%
contracts involving at least one million
 
02:01:46.800 --> 02:01:48.950 align:start position:0%
contracts involving at least one million
dollars

02:01:48.950 --> 02:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:01:51.750 --> 02:01:51.760 align:start position:0%
does the state have many contracts lower
 
02:01:53.830 --> 02:01:53.840 align:start position:0%
than that or how many
 
02:01:56.709 --> 02:01:56.719 align:start position:0%
what's the i would say yes the state has
 
02:01:59.189 --> 02:01:59.199 align:start position:0%
numerous small contracts and that's
 
02:02:00.870 --> 02:02:00.880 align:start position:0%
this was really sort of to set a
 
02:02:05.109 --> 02:02:05.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:06.790 --> 02:02:06.800 align:start position:0%
and in general i
 
02:02:08.310 --> 02:02:08.320 align:start position:0%
this might be a better
 
02:02:10.950 --> 02:02:10.960 align:start position:0%
question for the fabricators but
 
02:02:13.270 --> 02:02:13.280 align:start position:0%
when you're talking about large steel
 
02:02:15.910 --> 02:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
fabrication projects you're
 
02:02:18.149 --> 02:02:18.159 align:start position:0%
you're typically up in to much more
 
02:02:23.430 --> 02:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:26.149 --> 02:02:26.159 align:start position:0%
other questions representative allegro
 
02:02:28.229 --> 02:02:28.239 align:start position:0%
thank you is there a guardrail in the
 
02:02:32.229 --> 02:02:32.239 align:start position:0%
bill to keep contractors from
 
02:02:34.310 --> 02:02:34.320 align:start position:0%
the less than honorable
 
02:02:36.870 --> 02:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
practice of breaking a two million
 
02:02:38.790 --> 02:02:38.800 align:start position:0%
dollar contract into two one million
 
02:02:41.750 --> 02:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:43.910 --> 02:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
um i believe that's beyond the scope of
 
02:02:45.750 --> 02:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:02:47.910 --> 02:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
okay so the answer is no
 
02:02:50.790 --> 02:02:50.800 align:start position:0%
no thank you
 
02:02:53.350 --> 02:02:53.360 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions
 
02:02:55.910 --> 02:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
thank you senator thank you very much
 
02:02:58.390 --> 02:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
i see that all the steel fabricators who
 
02:03:00.390 --> 02:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
expect to benefit from this bill are
 
02:03:00.400 --> 02:03:01.270 align:start position:0%
expect to benefit from this bill are
here

02:03:01.270 --> 02:03:01.280 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:03:03.189 --> 02:03:03.199 align:start position:0%
is there anyone who wished to testify
 
02:03:07.669 --> 02:03:07.679 align:start position:0%
who is not a steel an iron fabricator
 
02:03:09.510 --> 02:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none thank you i'll
 
02:03:21.589 --> 02:03:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:21.599 --> 02:03:24.470 align:start position:0%
 
paperwork

02:03:24.470 --> 02:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:31.510 --> 02:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:32.870 --> 02:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you for having me

02:03:37.350 --> 02:03:37.360 align:start position:0%
i'm a little out of order
 
02:03:38.629 --> 02:03:38.639 align:start position:0%
but that's okay
 
02:03:40.470 --> 02:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
i'll i'll start off and you'll certainly
 
02:03:42.629 --> 02:03:42.639 align:start position:0%
hear from the fabricators involved i
 
02:03:44.149 --> 02:03:44.159 align:start position:0%
come at things from a slightly different
 
02:03:46.310 --> 02:03:46.320 align:start position:0%
perspective i'd actually be someone who
 
02:03:47.510 --> 02:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
would work with the fabricators
 
02:03:50.790 --> 02:03:50.800 align:start position:0%
downstream as i work with usi
 
02:03:53.510 --> 02:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
so i'm actually an insurance broker my
 
02:03:54.629 --> 02:03:54.639 align:start position:0%
background to give you a little
 
02:03:56.550 --> 02:03:56.560 align:start position:0%
perspective is uh i spent 10 years in
 
02:03:57.990 --> 02:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
the welding industry working for lincoln
 
02:04:00.229 --> 02:04:00.239 align:start position:0%
electric so i actually had the pleasure
 
02:04:02.709 --> 02:04:02.719 align:start position:0%
of working with many of these companies
 
02:04:04.310 --> 02:04:04.320 align:start position:0%
and many others throughout all of new
 
02:04:07.030 --> 02:04:07.040 align:start position:0%
england of varying sizes for the last
 
02:04:09.510 --> 02:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
six years i've spent my time in the risk
 
02:04:11.910 --> 02:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
management world and insurance
 
02:04:14.550 --> 02:04:14.560 align:start position:0%
so although my role has changed clearly
 
02:04:17.109 --> 02:04:17.119 align:start position:0%
uh it's always been a part of me in that
 
02:04:18.470 --> 02:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
welding world i still have my welding
 
02:04:19.830 --> 02:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
gear i'm still certainly capable of it
 
02:04:21.669 --> 02:04:21.679 align:start position:0%
and it's a industry that i certainly
 
02:04:23.350 --> 02:04:23.360 align:start position:0%
enjoy working with
 
02:04:25.350 --> 02:04:25.360 align:start position:0%
ultimately i'm in support of this bill
 
02:04:28.149 --> 02:04:28.159 align:start position:0%
because i want to see our publicly
 
02:04:30.310 --> 02:04:30.320 align:start position:0%
available dollars for projects like this
 
02:04:31.910 --> 02:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
to stay in new hampshire and to be
 
02:04:35.589 --> 02:04:35.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:37.830 --> 02:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
we all know that the silver tsunami is a
 
02:04:39.750 --> 02:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
real thing and the next generation needs
 
02:04:42.709 --> 02:04:42.719 align:start position:0%
local jobs part of my job uh when i was
 
02:04:44.950 --> 02:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
at lincoln electric in the welding world
 
02:04:47.350 --> 02:04:47.360 align:start position:0%
was working with groups like uh sico
 
02:04:48.709 --> 02:04:48.719 align:start position:0%
school of technology on which i was on
 
02:04:50.870 --> 02:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
the board i live in exeter so it's just
 
02:04:52.790 --> 02:04:52.800 align:start position:0%
down the road from me i also worked with
 
02:04:54.310 --> 02:04:54.320 align:start position:0%
other technical programs like white
 
02:04:55.589 --> 02:04:55.599 align:start position:0%
mountain community college and
 
02:04:57.669 --> 02:04:57.679 align:start position:0%
manchester community college in fact
 
02:04:59.350 --> 02:04:59.360 align:start position:0%
actually ran the skills usa competition
 
02:05:01.830 --> 02:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
for a few years in new hampshire as well
 
02:05:04.229 --> 02:05:04.239 align:start position:0%
so i've had the benefit and joy of
 
02:05:06.069 --> 02:05:06.079 align:start position:0%
seeing some of these students and just
 
02:05:07.430 --> 02:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
seeing how much it means to them and to
 
02:05:07.440 --> 02:05:08.390 align:start position:0%
seeing how much it means to them and to
have

02:05:08.390 --> 02:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:05:10.069 --> 02:05:10.079 align:start position:0%
jobs available to them when they get out
 
02:05:11.589 --> 02:05:11.599 align:start position:0%
of these schools and have a place to go
 
02:05:13.669 --> 02:05:13.679 align:start position:0%
that is local to the communities that
 
02:05:16.069 --> 02:05:16.079 align:start position:0%
they live in whether that's in greenland
 
02:05:19.830 --> 02:05:19.840 align:start position:0%
berlin or anywhere in between
 
02:05:21.510 --> 02:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
in my the another piece of this puzzle
 
02:05:22.950 --> 02:05:22.960 align:start position:0%
is that as an insurance broker i look at
 
02:05:24.709 --> 02:05:24.719 align:start position:0%
things from a different perspective
 
02:05:26.550 --> 02:05:26.560 align:start position:0%
when steel fabricators have more work
 
02:05:28.229 --> 02:05:28.239 align:start position:0%
and they have more employees that leads
 
02:05:28.239 --> 02:05:29.030 align:start position:0%
and they have more employees that leads
to

02:05:29.030 --> 02:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:05:31.430 --> 02:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
more things like workers comp premiums
 
02:05:32.870 --> 02:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
and what does that mean for us that
 
02:05:35.109 --> 02:05:35.119 align:start position:0%
means we can hire more people for our
 
02:05:37.109 --> 02:05:37.119 align:start position:0%
own industry that's account managers
 
02:05:37.119 --> 02:05:39.030 align:start position:0%
own industry that's account managers
producers

02:05:39.030 --> 02:05:39.040 align:start position:0%
producers
 
02:05:41.350 --> 02:05:41.360 align:start position:0%
lost control personnel etc it also leads
 
02:05:42.870 --> 02:05:42.880 align:start position:0%
to help us gather some additional
 
02:05:44.870 --> 02:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
analytical information so then we can
 
02:05:47.910 --> 02:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
use that to further our research within
 
02:05:49.510 --> 02:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
the industry and hopefully make it safer
 
02:05:52.069 --> 02:05:52.079 align:start position:0%
for those who are participating
 
02:05:53.669 --> 02:05:53.679 align:start position:0%
so needless to say
 
02:05:56.069 --> 02:05:56.079 align:start position:0%
i thank you all for your time
 
02:05:57.430 --> 02:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
02:05:57.440 --> 02:05:59.669 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
questions

02:05:59.669 --> 02:05:59.679 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:06:00.950 --> 02:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none thank you thank
 
02:06:00.960 --> 02:06:03.030 align:start position:0%

written testimony to provide please give

s.l chasey steele and my fellow new
 
02:07:07.990 --> 02:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire and new england-based steel
 
02:07:09.750 --> 02:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
fabricators see more structural steel
 
02:07:12.069 --> 02:07:12.079 align:start position:0%
buildings being fabricated outside the
 
02:07:13.830 --> 02:07:13.840 align:start position:0%
united states
 
02:07:16.069 --> 02:07:16.079 align:start position:0%
new hampshire state city and town tax
 
02:07:17.910 --> 02:07:17.920 align:start position:0%
dollars that are being used to fund
 
02:07:19.990 --> 02:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
municipal construction projects are
 
02:07:22.069 --> 02:07:22.079 align:start position:0%
going to foreign sale fabrication
 
02:07:23.669 --> 02:07:23.679 align:start position:0%
companies instead of local new hampshire
 
02:07:25.510 --> 02:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
based companies like ours
 
02:07:27.589 --> 02:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
i see local schools that our employees
 
02:07:29.830 --> 02:07:29.840 align:start position:0%
children's attend being fabricated
 
02:07:31.430 --> 02:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
outside of this country
 
02:07:33.189 --> 02:07:33.199 align:start position:0%
these children never had the opportunity
 
02:07:35.030 --> 02:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
to say to their classmates my father and
 
02:07:37.270 --> 02:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
my mother built our school
 
02:07:39.350 --> 02:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
when in fact their parents tax dollars
 
02:07:41.510 --> 02:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
paid for the school
 
02:07:43.669 --> 02:07:43.679 align:start position:0%
through flawed procurement laws our
 
02:07:45.669 --> 02:07:45.679 align:start position:0%
state city and town tax dollars money
 
02:07:46.870 --> 02:07:46.880 align:start position:0%
meant to strengthen new hampshire's
 
02:07:48.870 --> 02:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
economy leaves the country when foreign
 
02:07:50.790 --> 02:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
steel fabricators awarded work on the
 
02:07:52.629 --> 02:07:52.639 align:start position:0%
public construction projects
 
02:07:53.750 --> 02:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
in effect
 
02:07:55.189 --> 02:07:55.199 align:start position:0%
we are bolstering another country's
 
02:07:57.510 --> 02:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
economy instead of our own
 
02:07:59.030 --> 02:07:59.040 align:start position:0%
the situation has gotten to a point
 
02:08:00.709 --> 02:08:00.719 align:start position:0%
where it's almost a waste of resources
 
02:08:02.870 --> 02:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
to even bid on these projects
 
02:08:04.709 --> 02:08:04.719 align:start position:0%
foreign steel fabrication companies are
 
02:08:06.550 --> 02:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
often financially subsidized by their
 
02:08:08.629 --> 02:08:08.639 align:start position:0%
governments and or
 
02:08:10.629 --> 02:08:10.639 align:start position:0%
enjoy favorable currency exchanges with
 
02:08:12.470 --> 02:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
the united states enabling them to
 
02:08:14.550 --> 02:08:14.560 align:start position:0%
repeatedly undercut american fabricators
 
02:08:16.149 --> 02:08:16.159 align:start position:0%
in the bidding process
 
02:08:17.750 --> 02:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
when foreign fabricated steel is
 
02:08:20.069 --> 02:08:20.079 align:start position:0%
purchased there is no economic benefit
 
02:08:23.830 --> 02:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:25.910 --> 02:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
as i'm sure you know local spending has
 
02:08:28.470 --> 02:08:28.480 align:start position:0%
significant economic impacts on local
 
02:08:29.910 --> 02:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
and regional economies because of the
 
02:08:32.149 --> 02:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
multiplier effect local spending is
 
02:08:34.229 --> 02:08:34.239 align:start position:0%
multiplied multiplier
 
02:08:36.550 --> 02:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
impacts on employment income and tax
 
02:08:36.560 --> 02:08:37.830 align:start position:0%
impacts on employment income and tax
revenues

02:08:37.830 --> 02:08:37.840 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
02:08:39.669 --> 02:08:39.679 align:start position:0%
simply stated for every dollar spent on
 
02:08:42.310 --> 02:08:42.320 align:start position:0%
domestic fabricated steel 1.50 is
 
02:08:43.990 --> 02:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
generated in domestic
 
02:08:46.390 --> 02:08:46.400 align:start position:0%
economic activity for every dollar spent
 
02:08:48.470 --> 02:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
on foreign fabricated steel
 
02:08:50.550 --> 02:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
zero dollars are generated in domestic
 
02:08:52.229 --> 02:08:52.239 align:start position:0%
economic activity
 
02:08:54.310 --> 02:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
income associated with steel fabrication
 
02:08:56.229 --> 02:08:56.239 align:start position:0%
will will result in income to local
 
02:08:58.629 --> 02:08:58.639 align:start position:0%
residents this income will be spent on
 
02:09:00.310 --> 02:09:00.320 align:start position:0%
local goods and services such as
 
02:09:02.149 --> 02:09:02.159 align:start position:0%
restaurants lodging hardware stores and
 
02:09:04.470 --> 02:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
other local industries if these public
 
02:09:06.470 --> 02:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
construction projects awarded to foreign
 
02:09:08.709 --> 02:09:08.719 align:start position:0%
firms then the economic benefits will be
 
02:09:10.870 --> 02:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
demonstrated in the foreign economies
 
02:09:13.430 --> 02:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
thus resulting in zero economic stimulus
 
02:09:15.910 --> 02:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
to local regional and national economies
 
02:09:17.270 --> 02:09:17.280 align:start position:0%
we need you our state government to
 
02:09:19.510 --> 02:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
support senate bill 438 and keep our tax
 
02:09:21.430 --> 02:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
dollars here in new hampshire i thank
 
02:09:22.709 --> 02:09:22.719 align:start position:0%
you for your time and consideration of
 
02:09:23.990 --> 02:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
this matter
 
02:09:26.470 --> 02:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions
 
02:09:28.629 --> 02:09:28.639 align:start position:0%
representative psychic
 
02:09:33.350 --> 02:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:35.350 --> 02:09:35.360 align:start position:0%
i don't know it's
 
02:09:37.669 --> 02:09:37.679 align:start position:0%
i don't know what's going on
 
02:09:39.109 --> 02:09:39.119 align:start position:0%
how can
 
02:09:41.430 --> 02:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
i when i saw this i thought you're
 
02:09:41.440 --> 02:09:42.870 align:start position:0%
i when i saw this i thought you're
smelting

02:09:42.870 --> 02:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
smelting
 
02:09:45.510 --> 02:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
you know taking ore and making
 
02:09:47.669 --> 02:09:47.679 align:start position:0%
the pictures of the blast furnaces
 
02:09:50.470 --> 02:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
you're talking about fabrication correct
 
02:09:52.629 --> 02:09:52.639 align:start position:0%
well how does a foreign company come in
 
02:09:54.390 --> 02:09:54.400 align:start position:0%
and do fabrication
 
02:09:56.790 --> 02:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
i understand that they fabricate in a
 
02:09:58.950 --> 02:09:58.960 align:start position:0%
different country they truck it
 
02:10:00.709 --> 02:10:00.719 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire
 
02:10:02.870 --> 02:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
and then they hire or they have their
 
02:10:04.709 --> 02:10:04.719 align:start position:0%
own erectors that erect a steel in new
 
02:10:06.709 --> 02:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
hampshire so the steel is actually
 
02:10:09.030 --> 02:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
fabricated in a different country by
 
02:10:11.430 --> 02:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
that companies or that company
 
02:10:13.510 --> 02:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
that is in that country their employees
 
02:10:15.430 --> 02:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
not our employees they ship it to the
 
02:10:17.430 --> 02:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
united states
 
02:10:23.109 --> 02:10:23.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:24.830 --> 02:10:24.840 align:start position:0%
salem just built
 
02:10:28.149 --> 02:10:28.159 align:start position:0%
a hospital uh oh i can't think of the
 
02:10:29.830 --> 02:10:29.840 align:start position:0%
name right mass general has built
 
02:10:31.830 --> 02:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
something there and i saw that all the
 
02:10:33.589 --> 02:10:33.599 align:start position:0%
steel framework
 
02:10:35.430 --> 02:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
amazing how the steel is holding that
 
02:10:37.830 --> 02:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
whole building up
 
02:10:39.990 --> 02:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
who where did that how did that how
 
02:10:42.709 --> 02:10:42.719 align:start position:0%
would this affect
 
02:10:44.709 --> 02:10:44.719 align:start position:0%
that's private but assuming it was a
 
02:10:45.990 --> 02:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
government thing
 
02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.229 align:start position:0%
government thing
how

02:10:48.229 --> 02:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
how
 
02:10:50.229 --> 02:10:50.239 align:start position:0%
this you buy the same steel from
 
02:10:53.589 --> 02:10:53.599 align:start position:0%
somebody direct to build the thing i i
 
02:10:55.830 --> 02:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
i'm really at a loss to understand they
 
02:10:55.840 --> 02:10:56.629 align:start position:0%
i'm really at a loss to understand they
can

02:10:56.629 --> 02:10:56.639 align:start position:0%
can
 
02:10:58.310 --> 02:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
fabricate steel
 
02:10:58.320 --> 02:10:59.990 align:start position:0%
fabricate steel
cheaper

02:10:59.990 --> 02:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
cheaper
 
02:11:01.990 --> 02:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
they bring 60 cents into the united
 
02:11:04.149 --> 02:11:04.159 align:start position:0%
states and leave with a dollar
 
02:11:05.750 --> 02:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
the exchange rate
 
02:11:09.030 --> 02:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
is so much different um there's
 
02:11:11.430 --> 02:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
you know there's this their government
 
02:11:12.870 --> 02:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
pays for their electricity in their
 
02:11:14.310 --> 02:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
shops there's just so many different
 
02:11:15.830 --> 02:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
factors going on
 
02:11:18.550 --> 02:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
um where they can come in and sell steel
 
02:11:20.870 --> 02:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
from basically below our cost
 
02:11:20.880 --> 02:11:21.750 align:start position:0%
from basically below our cost
um

02:11:21.750 --> 02:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:23.910 --> 02:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
there was there were tariffs on steel
 
02:11:25.589 --> 02:11:25.599 align:start position:0%
coming into the united states they
 
02:11:27.589 --> 02:11:27.599 align:start position:0%
didn't see those tariffs you know we
 
02:11:29.030 --> 02:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
were paying more for steel than they
 
02:11:30.870 --> 02:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
were paying for steel so there's many
 
02:11:33.830 --> 02:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
many factors where they can undercut us
 
02:11:35.669 --> 02:11:35.679 align:start position:0%
and it's gotten to a point where many
 
02:11:37.109 --> 02:11:37.119 align:start position:0%
steel fabrication companies have gone
 
02:11:38.709 --> 02:11:38.719 align:start position:0%
out of business over the years in new
 
02:11:40.950 --> 02:11:40.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire in massachusetts they just
 
02:11:42.870 --> 02:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
can't compete on the bigger jobs on the
 
02:11:45.189 --> 02:11:45.199 align:start position:0%
public jobs
 
02:11:46.629 --> 02:11:46.639 align:start position:0%
any just about any school in
 
02:11:46.639 --> 02:11:48.470 align:start position:0%
any just about any school in
massachusetts

02:11:48.470 --> 02:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
02:11:51.750 --> 02:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
has been fabricated by foreign steel
 
02:11:54.310 --> 02:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
many in new hampshire
 
02:11:55.910 --> 02:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative marsh and then
 
02:11:55.920 --> 02:11:57.350 align:start position:0%
thank you representative marsh and then
grota

02:11:57.350 --> 02:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
grota
 
02:11:59.350 --> 02:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i'm uh wondering
 
02:12:00.950 --> 02:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
if dan thank you for taking my question
 
02:12:02.470 --> 02:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if you can answer the
 
02:12:04.069 --> 02:12:04.079 align:start position:0%
question that i asked senator sherman
 
02:12:06.709 --> 02:12:06.719 align:start position:0%
which is uh since you're fabricating
 
02:12:08.629 --> 02:12:08.639 align:start position:0%
steel where do you get the raw material
 
02:12:11.270 --> 02:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
that you fabricate into your final
 
02:12:12.870 --> 02:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
product correct there are many mills in
 
02:12:14.229 --> 02:12:14.239 align:start position:0%
the united states and throughout the
 
02:12:15.750 --> 02:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
world that
 
02:12:18.950 --> 02:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
process the material from iron ore from
 
02:12:21.189 --> 02:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
scrap metal
 
02:12:22.870 --> 02:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
they form it into
 
02:12:25.350 --> 02:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
different size members different shapes
 
02:12:27.589 --> 02:12:27.599 align:start position:0%
and then it is delivered to fabricators
 
02:12:30.069 --> 02:12:30.079 align:start position:0%
in a certain in a certain form usually
 
02:12:32.709 --> 02:12:32.719 align:start position:0%
in 60 60 foot lengths stock lengths of
 
02:12:32.719 --> 02:12:33.750 align:start position:0%
in 60 60 foot lengths stock lengths of
material

02:12:33.750 --> 02:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
material
 
02:12:33.760 --> 02:12:34.390 align:start position:0%
material
so

02:12:34.390 --> 02:12:34.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:12:37.510 --> 02:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
you said you lived in pennsylvania
 
02:12:38.790 --> 02:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
pittsburgh used to have quite the
 
02:12:41.510 --> 02:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
stealing so right so a lot of the steel
 
02:12:43.270 --> 02:12:43.280 align:start position:0%
that came to fabricators came from
 
02:12:45.189 --> 02:12:45.199 align:start position:0%
pittsburgh pennsylvania back in the day
 
02:12:46.870 --> 02:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
it comes from other places now but still
 
02:12:48.390 --> 02:12:48.400 align:start position:0%
there is still quite a bit that is
 
02:12:52.229 --> 02:12:52.239 align:start position:0%
actually processed in uh united states
 
02:12:55.350 --> 02:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
but we get it in its form after it's pro
 
02:12:57.270 --> 02:12:57.280 align:start position:0%
after it's um manufac after it's
 
02:13:00.229 --> 02:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
processed um and then we fabricate from
 
02:13:02.390 --> 02:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
that material no different than a tree
 
02:13:04.229 --> 02:13:04.239 align:start position:0%
being cut down in the woods and a lumber
 
02:13:06.790 --> 02:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
mill makes a wood and then a carpenter
 
02:13:08.870 --> 02:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
frames a house out of that wood
 
02:13:08.880 --> 02:13:10.149 align:start position:0%
frames a house out of that wood
um

02:13:10.149 --> 02:13:10.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:12.229 --> 02:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
can i ask a follow-up follow up yet
 
02:13:13.830 --> 02:13:13.840 align:start position:0%
uh if i look at the bill that we're
 
02:13:15.589 --> 02:13:15.599 align:start position:0%
debating here on
 
02:13:17.830 --> 02:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
page one line nine it says the
 
02:13:19.589 --> 02:13:19.599 align:start position:0%
definition of domestic fabricated
 
02:13:21.990 --> 02:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
structural steel shall mean an iron or
 
02:13:22.950 --> 02:13:22.960 align:start position:0%
steel product where all the
 
02:13:24.470 --> 02:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
manufacturing must take place in the
 
02:13:26.470 --> 02:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
united states from the initial melting
 
02:13:28.550 --> 02:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
stage and etc
 
02:13:30.870 --> 02:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
if you're actually importing the steel
 
02:13:33.189 --> 02:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
bars that you're then fabricating
 
02:13:36.149 --> 02:13:36.159 align:start position:0%
would this then exclude you from no can
 
02:13:37.990 --> 02:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
you read that again to me i'm sorry uh
 
02:13:39.750 --> 02:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
what the bill yes it would it clearly
 
02:13:41.189 --> 02:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
states that the
 
02:13:43.990 --> 02:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
the initial from the initial melting
 
02:13:45.990 --> 02:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
stage has to be done in the united
 
02:13:48.310 --> 02:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
states so you would not be able to buy
 
02:13:50.709 --> 02:13:50.719 align:start position:0%
foreign steel bars that if that's the
 
02:13:52.870 --> 02:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
case that is even uh
 
02:13:55.189 --> 02:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
it's that's not a bad thing let's put it
 
02:13:56.870 --> 02:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
that way so all steel
 
02:13:58.629 --> 02:13:58.639 align:start position:0%
for united states buildings for new
 
02:14:00.470 --> 02:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire buildings should be
 
02:14:03.030 --> 02:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
processed in in the united states
 
02:14:03.040 --> 02:14:04.310 align:start position:0%
processed in in the united states
um

02:14:04.310 --> 02:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:06.149 --> 02:14:06.159 align:start position:0%
and that would also give the companies
 
02:14:08.709 --> 02:14:08.719 align:start position:0%
that actual process the material a leg
 
02:14:10.709 --> 02:14:10.719 align:start position:0%
up so that they're not dealing with the
 
02:14:12.390 --> 02:14:12.400 align:start position:0%
competition yep
 
02:14:14.870 --> 02:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
follow up one final product it's my un
 
02:14:17.189 --> 02:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
understanding that new hampshire imports
 
02:14:19.109 --> 02:14:19.119 align:start position:0%
approximately 41 million dollars per
 
02:14:21.189 --> 02:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
year of canadian steel which may be
 
02:14:22.550 --> 02:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
where you're getting your wrong material
 
02:14:25.270 --> 02:14:25.280 align:start position:0%
from should we not and and there was
 
02:14:26.629 --> 02:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
recently a trade agreement with the
 
02:14:29.109 --> 02:14:29.119 align:start position:0%
government of canada about that uh would
 
02:14:30.950 --> 02:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
it not be reasonable for us to change
 
02:14:32.950 --> 02:14:32.960 align:start position:0%
this definition so we do not get in the
 
02:14:34.950 --> 02:14:34.960 align:start position:0%
way of what's currently
 
02:14:36.870 --> 02:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
been negotiated between
 
02:14:39.750 --> 02:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
uh the manufacturers the smelters that
 
02:14:41.109 --> 02:14:41.119 align:start position:0%
you may be getting your raw material
 
02:14:41.119 --> 02:14:44.229 align:start position:0%
you may be getting your raw material
from

02:14:44.229 --> 02:14:44.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:46.149 --> 02:14:46.159 align:start position:0%
i can't answer that i'm a i'm a
 
02:14:46.159 --> 02:14:48.149 align:start position:0%
i can't answer that i'm a i'm a
fabricator

02:14:48.149 --> 02:14:48.159 align:start position:0%
fabricator
 
02:14:48.159 --> 02:14:49.350 align:start position:0%
fabricator
that's

02:14:49.350 --> 02:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:14:51.270 --> 02:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
more than i have than the knowledge that
 
02:14:53.030 --> 02:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
i have i can see
 
02:14:55.589 --> 02:14:55.599 align:start position:0%
us purchasing united states steel as a
 
02:14:58.310 --> 02:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
benefit to the whole country
 
02:14:59.510 --> 02:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
and i have no problem with that
 
02:15:01.430 --> 02:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
whatsoever as long as we can all be
 
02:15:01.440 --> 02:15:03.109 align:start position:0%
whatsoever as long as we can all be
competitive

02:15:03.109 --> 02:15:03.119 align:start position:0%
competitive
 
02:15:05.510 --> 02:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
02:15:07.510 --> 02:15:07.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:15:09.430 --> 02:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
02:15:12.709 --> 02:15:12.719 align:start position:0%
in um i had the opportunity to visit
 
02:15:15.510 --> 02:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
novel ironworks and i found it very
 
02:15:15.520 --> 02:15:16.790 align:start position:0%
novel ironworks and i found it very
fascinating

02:15:16.790 --> 02:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
fascinating
 
02:15:16.800 --> 02:15:17.589 align:start position:0%
fascinating
so

02:15:17.589 --> 02:15:17.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:15:19.910 --> 02:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
is your facility similar to
 
02:15:19.920 --> 02:15:20.830 align:start position:0%
is your facility similar to
that

02:15:20.830 --> 02:15:20.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:15:23.910 --> 02:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
one and would it be
 
02:15:27.510 --> 02:15:27.520 align:start position:0%
my two yes i'm sorry follow up excuse me
 
02:15:29.750 --> 02:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
might you be interested to have
 
02:15:32.709 --> 02:15:32.719 align:start position:0%
representatives who live in this area
 
02:15:34.149 --> 02:15:34.159 align:start position:0%
visit your facility so that you could
 
02:15:36.629 --> 02:15:36.639 align:start position:0%
show to them how complicated
 
02:15:38.149 --> 02:15:38.159 align:start position:0%
this is
 
02:15:40.390 --> 02:15:40.400 align:start position:0%
we'd love to have people come by
 
02:15:43.589 --> 02:15:43.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:43.599 --> 02:15:45.910 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:15:45.910 --> 02:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:47.350 --> 02:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
could you
 
02:15:49.589 --> 02:15:49.599 align:start position:0%
explain to the committee
 
02:15:49.599 --> 02:15:53.109 align:start position:0%
explain to the committee
how

02:15:53.109 --> 02:15:53.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:56.229 --> 02:15:56.239 align:start position:0%
your facility or facilities like yours
 
02:15:59.510 --> 02:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
make components from engineering plans
 
02:16:01.109 --> 02:16:01.119 align:start position:0%
so that you're actually building the
 
02:16:02.950 --> 02:16:02.960 align:start position:0%
construction components of the building
 
02:16:05.589 --> 02:16:05.599 align:start position:0%
uh excuse me i think that that would be
 
02:16:07.589 --> 02:16:07.599 align:start position:0%
fascinating and would love to hear it
 
02:16:09.109 --> 02:16:09.119 align:start position:0%
but i think that's a bit beyond the
 
02:16:11.750 --> 02:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
scope of this particular bill in as much
 
02:16:13.270 --> 02:16:13.280 align:start position:0%
as components
 
02:16:16.629 --> 02:16:16.639 align:start position:0%
are specifically exempted
 
02:16:18.390 --> 02:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:16:20.629 --> 02:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions
 
02:16:22.310 --> 02:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:16:42.709 --> 02:16:42.719 align:start position:0%

as you review the benefits this bill
 
02:17:07.270 --> 02:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
will bring to our communities we know

i care about our industry and i'm
 
02:17:56.309 --> 02:17:56.319 align:start position:0%
committed to seeing this bill through i

look forward to the economic success
 
02:17:59.589 --> 02:17:59.599 align:start position:0%
this bill will have not only for our
 
02:18:01.910 --> 02:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
communities but for our employees their
 
02:18:03.509 --> 02:18:03.519 align:start position:0%
families and the surrounding communities
 
02:18:06.790 --> 02:18:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:09.110 --> 02:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
ten years ago i took a chance on the
 
02:18:10.709 --> 02:18:10.719 align:start position:0%
city of berlin new hampshire and built
 
02:18:13.349 --> 02:18:13.359 align:start position:0%
capone corporation north woods
 
02:18:14.950 --> 02:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
this is a state-of-the-art facility and
 
02:18:17.270 --> 02:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
offers employment opportunity to an
 
02:18:20.150 --> 02:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
otherwise economically challenged area
 
02:18:22.469 --> 02:18:22.479 align:start position:0%
our employees are hard-working good
 
02:18:22.479 --> 02:18:23.589 align:start position:0%
our employees are hard-working good
individuals

02:18:23.589 --> 02:18:23.599 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
02:18:25.509 --> 02:18:25.519 align:start position:0%
people who live work and spend locally
 
02:18:26.629 --> 02:18:26.639 align:start position:0%
in our new hampshire towns and
 
02:18:26.639 --> 02:18:28.150 align:start position:0%
in our new hampshire towns and
communities

02:18:28.150 --> 02:18:28.160 align:start position:0%
communities
 
02:18:29.830 --> 02:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
more importantly in addition to our
 
02:18:31.589 --> 02:18:31.599 align:start position:0%
corporate tax responsibilities our
 
02:18:33.589 --> 02:18:33.599 align:start position:0%
employees also pay their taxes in these
 
02:18:33.599 --> 02:18:36.150 align:start position:0%
employees also pay their taxes in these
communities

02:18:36.150 --> 02:18:36.160 align:start position:0%
communities
 
02:18:39.110 --> 02:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
herein lies our concern
 
02:18:41.030 --> 02:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire tax dollars meant to
 
02:18:43.110 --> 02:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
invigorate our local economy by way of
 
02:18:45.509 --> 02:18:45.519 align:start position:0%
publicly funded construction projects
 
02:18:47.589 --> 02:18:47.599 align:start position:0%
are instead leaving our state and our
 
02:18:49.349 --> 02:18:49.359 align:start position:0%
country because of current flawed
 
02:18:51.349 --> 02:18:51.359 align:start position:0%
procurement process
 
02:18:53.270 --> 02:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
contract awards going to the lowest
 
02:18:55.750 --> 02:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
bidder no matter where they're from
 
02:18:58.070 --> 02:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
under the misinformed guys of saving
 
02:18:58.080 --> 02:18:59.750 align:start position:0%
under the misinformed guys of saving
money

02:18:59.750 --> 02:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
money
 
02:19:01.910 --> 02:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
the reality is when tax dollars leave
 
02:19:03.830 --> 02:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
our state we lose more than the initial
 
02:19:03.840 --> 02:19:05.030 align:start position:0%
our state we lose more than the initial
savings

02:19:05.030 --> 02:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
savings
 
02:19:08.150 --> 02:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
than by choosing a foreign fabricator
 
02:19:10.709 --> 02:19:10.719 align:start position:0%
the economic multiplier indicates that
 
02:19:13.030 --> 02:19:13.040 align:start position:0%
for every dollar spent a dollar fifty is
 
02:19:15.349 --> 02:19:15.359 align:start position:0%
generated in the community
 
02:19:17.349 --> 02:19:17.359 align:start position:0%
that means more people are employed more
 
02:19:19.190 --> 02:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
people are spending money locally and we
 
02:19:21.030 --> 02:19:21.040 align:start position:0%
all benefit from that
 
02:19:23.589 --> 02:19:23.599 align:start position:0%
but more than that if the funds continue
 
02:19:26.549 --> 02:19:26.559 align:start position:0%
to leave the state no one benefits
 
02:19:29.030 --> 02:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
the perceived savings from choosing the
 
02:19:31.589 --> 02:19:31.599 align:start position:0%
lowest bidder puts people out of work
 
02:19:33.270 --> 02:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
employers out of business stores and
 
02:19:35.349 --> 02:19:35.359 align:start position:0%
restaurants then lose customers they go
 
02:19:37.349 --> 02:19:37.359 align:start position:0%
out of business and the cycle spins out
 
02:19:39.270 --> 02:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
of control
 
02:19:40.870 --> 02:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
when publicly funded construction
 
02:19:42.469 --> 02:19:42.479 align:start position:0%
projects awarded to foreign steel
 
02:19:44.629 --> 02:19:44.639 align:start position:0%
fabricators we are in effect
 
02:19:47.349 --> 02:19:47.359 align:start position:0%
funding our competition to our own
 
02:19:49.510 --> 02:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
demise while negatively impacting our
 
02:19:50.950 --> 02:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
own communities
 
02:19:54.070 --> 02:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
and supporting theirs think about that
 
02:19:57.510 --> 02:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
we're funding our own demise
 
02:19:59.349 --> 02:19:59.359 align:start position:0%
if these projects were awarded to
 
02:20:01.110 --> 02:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
domestic steel fabricators they would
 
02:20:03.750 --> 02:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
employ more workers the same workers who
 
02:20:05.510 --> 02:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
spend their money in the communities
 
02:20:09.270 --> 02:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:10.950 --> 02:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
by all accounts foreign steel
 
02:20:12.230 --> 02:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
fabrication companies have been
 
02:20:14.830 --> 02:20:14.840 align:start position:0%
decimating our industry for over two
 
02:20:17.349 --> 02:20:17.359 align:start position:0%
decades many of these companies are
 
02:20:19.270 --> 02:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
subsidized by the governments and enjoy
 
02:20:21.510 --> 02:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
favorable currency exchange
 
02:20:24.309 --> 02:20:24.319 align:start position:0%
which allows them to repeatedly undercut
 
02:20:25.910 --> 02:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
domestic fabricators in the bidding
 
02:20:25.920 --> 02:20:27.830 align:start position:0%
domestic fabricators in the bidding
process

02:20:27.830 --> 02:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:20:30.309 --> 02:20:30.319 align:start position:0%
this situation is so bad that my company
 
02:20:31.670 --> 02:20:31.680 align:start position:0%
cannot justify the expense of
 
02:20:33.750 --> 02:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
competitively bid on public construction
 
02:20:35.830 --> 02:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
projects as we will surely lose to a
 
02:20:39.590 --> 02:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:41.270 --> 02:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
these projects are often in our own
 
02:20:43.429 --> 02:20:43.439 align:start position:0%
backyard adding insult to injury the
 
02:20:44.950 --> 02:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
practice of allowing foreign steel
 
02:20:47.830 --> 02:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
fabricators to bend bid and win these
 
02:20:49.990 --> 02:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
publicly funded construction projects is
 
02:20:52.150 --> 02:20:52.160 align:start position:0%
destroying our amer our american
 
02:20:54.309 --> 02:20:54.319 align:start position:0%
industry and ultimately impacting the
 
02:20:55.349 --> 02:20:55.359 align:start position:0%
people of new hampshire and the
 
02:20:59.750 --> 02:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:02.230 --> 02:21:02.240 align:start position:0%
as our elected officials
 
02:21:04.630 --> 02:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
we employ you to take action we need to
 
02:21:06.150 --> 02:21:06.160 align:start position:0%
support this bill and keep our tax
 
02:21:08.389 --> 02:21:08.399 align:start position:0%
dollars here in new hampshire
 
02:21:10.309 --> 02:21:10.319 align:start position:0%
the philosophy is simple
 
02:21:12.389 --> 02:21:12.399 align:start position:0%
our tax dollars are meant for
 
02:21:13.830 --> 02:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
meant for our publicly construction
 
02:21:15.830 --> 02:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
projects need to stay within our own
 
02:21:17.429 --> 02:21:17.439 align:start position:0%
domestic communities
 
02:21:19.590 --> 02:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
by way of the economic multiplier the
 
02:21:21.510 --> 02:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
reinvestment into our own communities
 
02:21:23.590 --> 02:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
will support our local businesses our
 
02:21:26.070 --> 02:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
employees and our state economy not the
 
02:21:29.110 --> 02:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
economies of foreign countries
 
02:21:30.950 --> 02:21:30.960 align:start position:0%

thank you representative fellowes has a
question

02:21:38.309 --> 02:21:38.319 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:21:41.030 --> 02:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr capone um i recently read
 
02:21:43.349 --> 02:21:43.359 align:start position:0%
an article in the union leader
 
02:21:45.670 --> 02:21:45.680 align:start position:0%
um about a company that was
 
02:21:45.680 --> 02:21:47.990 align:start position:0%
um about a company that was
manufacturing

02:21:47.990 --> 02:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
manufacturing
 
02:21:52.150 --> 02:21:52.160 align:start position:0%
frames i think for bitcoin computers
 
02:21:54.870 --> 02:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
is that your company or do you
 
02:21:57.030 --> 02:21:57.040 align:start position:0%
no no we're we're a structural steel and
 
02:21:59.190 --> 02:21:59.200 align:start position:0%
miscellaneous iron fabricator much like
 
02:21:59.200 --> 02:21:59.910 align:start position:0%
miscellaneous iron fabricator much like
the

02:21:59.910 --> 02:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:22:02.150 --> 02:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
sl chases of the world we build the um
 
02:22:04.469 --> 02:22:04.479 align:start position:0%
super structures for the buildings uh
 
02:22:06.230 --> 02:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
that you'll see going up
 
02:22:09.830 --> 02:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
oh thank you can't just follow up so
 
02:22:11.510 --> 02:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
just um
 
02:22:13.270 --> 02:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
was what they were doing is that
 
02:22:17.270 --> 02:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
fabrication also or not probably miss
 
02:22:19.590 --> 02:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
they were doing what they call mining
 
02:22:22.710 --> 02:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
and which is basically calculations well
 
02:22:22.720 --> 02:22:23.510 align:start position:0%
and which is basically calculations well
that

02:22:23.510 --> 02:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:22:25.590 --> 02:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
that's not my question my question is
 
02:22:25.600 --> 02:22:26.550 align:start position:0%
that's not my question my question is
about

02:22:26.550 --> 02:22:26.560 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:22:27.830 --> 02:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
not what's
 
02:22:30.309 --> 02:22:30.319 align:start position:0%
they're building frames for something so
 
02:22:31.750 --> 02:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
i i i
 
02:22:33.670 --> 02:22:33.680 align:start position:0%
know very little about crypto and all
 
02:22:36.710 --> 02:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
that and i i choose not to okay it's
 
02:22:36.720 --> 02:22:40.150 align:start position:0%
that and i i choose not to okay it's
scary

02:22:40.150 --> 02:22:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:40.160 --> 02:22:41.190 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:22:41.190 --> 02:22:41.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:22:43.830 --> 02:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much other questions
 
02:22:45.429 --> 02:22:45.439 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
02:23:01.349 --> 02:23:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:03.349 --> 02:23:03.359 align:start position:0%
hello uh thank you for
 
02:23:04.950 --> 02:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
allowing me the opportunity to speak to
 
02:23:07.030 --> 02:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
the committee here my name is cliff
 
02:23:08.950 --> 02:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
thornberry i'm one of the owners and the
 
02:23:11.190 --> 02:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
president of american steel fabricators
 
02:23:13.990 --> 02:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
we're in greenfield new hampshire
 
02:23:16.150 --> 02:23:16.160 align:start position:0%
uh sort of out in the boonies
 
02:23:18.469 --> 02:23:18.479 align:start position:0%
uh we're one of the
 
02:23:20.389 --> 02:23:20.399 align:start position:0%
only manufacturing companies in that
 
02:23:22.230 --> 02:23:22.240 align:start position:0%
area and we employ a lot of the local
 
02:23:22.240 --> 02:23:23.750 align:start position:0%
area and we employ a lot of the local
employees

02:23:23.750 --> 02:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
employees
 
02:23:26.790 --> 02:23:26.800 align:start position:0%
so there are there are four main reasons
 
02:23:29.190 --> 02:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
why i'm supporting this bill
 
02:23:29.200 --> 02:23:30.150 align:start position:0%
why i'm supporting this bill
and

02:23:30.150 --> 02:23:30.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:23:31.750 --> 02:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
one of them obviously is personal
 
02:23:33.830 --> 02:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
because i'm in this business but the
 
02:23:36.309 --> 02:23:36.319 align:start position:0%
other three i think are are national
 
02:23:36.319 --> 02:23:37.750 align:start position:0%
other three i think are are national
concerns

02:23:37.750 --> 02:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
02:23:40.550 --> 02:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
and the first one is to support
 
02:23:42.630 --> 02:23:42.640 align:start position:0%
the american steel industry
 
02:23:45.349 --> 02:23:45.359 align:start position:0%
now i grew up and spent almost 50 years
 
02:23:46.790 --> 02:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
in pittsburgh
 
02:23:48.870 --> 02:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
uh i lived in the south hills not sure
 
02:23:52.070 --> 02:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:54.389 --> 02:23:54.399 align:start position:0%
oh okay so then i i moved to zealand
 
02:23:56.389 --> 02:23:56.399 align:start position:0%
opal so i was a neighbor
 
02:23:56.399 --> 02:23:57.830 align:start position:0%
opal so i was a neighbor
so

02:23:57.830 --> 02:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:23:59.990 --> 02:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
you know my father was in the steel
 
02:24:02.070 --> 02:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
industry for for lincoln electric and
 
02:24:03.830 --> 02:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
when i was young
 
02:24:05.830 --> 02:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
he would often take me on saturday to
 
02:24:09.030 --> 02:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
some of the plants that he visit visited
 
02:24:11.429 --> 02:24:11.439 align:start position:0%
and i was able to go at the age of seven
 
02:24:13.190 --> 02:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
or eight to
 
02:24:15.190 --> 02:24:15.200 align:start position:0%
a plant called american bridge which at
 
02:24:17.670 --> 02:24:17.680 align:start position:0%
the time was the largest steel
 
02:24:19.510 --> 02:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
fabricator in the world in ambridge
 
02:24:19.520 --> 02:24:21.030 align:start position:0%
fabricator in the world in ambridge
pennsylvania

02:24:21.030 --> 02:24:21.040 align:start position:0%
pennsylvania
 
02:24:23.429 --> 02:24:23.439 align:start position:0%
they were started by andrew carnegie
 
02:24:25.590 --> 02:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
back in the 1850s they were actually the
 
02:24:28.550 --> 02:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
first corporation in america
 
02:24:30.309 --> 02:24:30.319 align:start position:0%
the first construction company
 
02:24:33.670 --> 02:24:33.680 align:start position:0%
corporation in the 1850s
 
02:24:37.270 --> 02:24:37.280 align:start position:0%
they had 15 000 employees in that plant
 
02:24:39.110 --> 02:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
it's all gone today it's a it's a
 
02:24:40.870 --> 02:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
shopping center
 
02:24:43.349 --> 02:24:43.359 align:start position:0%
and when i was in that plant i saw them
 
02:24:43.359 --> 02:24:44.950 align:start position:0%
and when i was in that plant i saw them
fabricating

02:24:44.950 --> 02:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
fabricating
 
02:24:47.590 --> 02:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
the twin towers in new york city the big
 
02:24:49.910 --> 02:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
panels that when the the towers fell
 
02:24:51.590 --> 02:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
that there was a picture of one standing
 
02:24:53.830 --> 02:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
up i saw them fabricating those panels
 
02:24:56.630 --> 02:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
because it was very unique excuse me i'm
 
02:24:59.750 --> 02:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
this is really fascinating but we are
 
02:25:02.070 --> 02:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
we have overrun our time a bit and so if
 
02:25:04.070 --> 02:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
you could concentrate on the bill i
 
02:25:05.590 --> 02:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
would very much appreciate it anyway
 
02:25:07.270 --> 02:25:07.280 align:start position:0%
that's one of the reasons i'm supporting
 
02:25:09.349 --> 02:25:09.359 align:start position:0%
the bill the other one is is
 
02:25:11.190 --> 02:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
to support the steel industry because
 
02:25:13.750 --> 02:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
it's it's the most climate change
 
02:25:16.550 --> 02:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
friendly product compared to concrete a
 
02:25:19.910 --> 02:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
95 percent of steel is recycled it's far
 
02:25:21.510 --> 02:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
and away more
 
02:25:23.510 --> 02:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
environmentally friendly than concrete
 
02:25:26.070 --> 02:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
the third is to support our our local
 
02:25:26.080 --> 02:25:27.590 align:start position:0%
the third is to support our our local
employees

02:25:27.590 --> 02:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
employees
 
02:25:29.830 --> 02:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
and i just want to relate just an
 
02:25:31.990 --> 02:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
antidote here i didn't prepare i'm sorry
 
02:25:33.830 --> 02:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
i've written testimony so i have to live
 
02:25:37.110 --> 02:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
with my personal antidote but
 
02:25:39.990 --> 02:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
there was a project uh very close to our
 
02:25:42.870 --> 02:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
plant in in in peterborough uh new
 
02:25:42.880 --> 02:25:43.830 align:start position:0%
plant in in in peterborough uh new
hampshire

02:25:43.830 --> 02:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:25:46.710 --> 02:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
for a library and and our a lot of our
 
02:25:48.150 --> 02:25:48.160 align:start position:0%
employees lived there our controller
 
02:25:49.910 --> 02:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
lives there two of our project managers
 
02:25:52.550 --> 02:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
lived there there was a fund established
 
02:25:54.550 --> 02:25:54.560 align:start position:0%
to build this library and everybody was
 
02:25:56.950 --> 02:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
contributing and we bid on the library
 
02:25:58.070 --> 02:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
and we were told by the general
 
02:25:59.830 --> 02:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
contractor we had a good price and they
 
02:26:01.510 --> 02:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
got the job
 
02:26:02.790 --> 02:26:02.800 align:start position:0%
a few months later we said you're going
 
02:26:04.389 --> 02:26:04.399 align:start position:0%
to you're going to award us this job oh
 
02:26:06.309 --> 02:26:06.319 align:start position:0%
no no we gave it to a canadian company
 
02:26:08.230 --> 02:26:08.240 align:start position:0%
they came in and undercut your price by
 
02:26:10.150 --> 02:26:10.160 align:start position:0%
a few thousand dollars and i said well
 
02:26:12.469 --> 02:26:12.479 align:start position:0%
does the town know that oh yeah the town
 
02:26:14.870 --> 02:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
the town manager knows that i'm not sure
 
02:26:16.870 --> 02:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
the town people knew it i'm not sure our
 
02:26:18.389 --> 02:26:18.399 align:start position:0%
employees or my employees have been
 
02:26:20.469 --> 02:26:20.479 align:start position:0%
asking me why didn't we fabricate this
 
02:26:22.150 --> 02:26:22.160 align:start position:0%
it's five miles from our shop i lived
 
02:26:25.190 --> 02:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
next door to it i sent money to it
 
02:26:28.150 --> 02:26:28.160 align:start position:0%
the the gc didn't do anything illegal
 
02:26:30.550 --> 02:26:30.560 align:start position:0%
um you know there was no law that says
 
02:26:32.309 --> 02:26:32.319 align:start position:0%
they couldn't do that
 
02:26:34.550 --> 02:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
but that's just an example of uh and
 
02:26:36.630 --> 02:26:36.640 align:start position:0%
many other people who have have other
 
02:26:38.710 --> 02:26:38.720 align:start position:0%
similar examples that we just can't
 
02:26:41.030 --> 02:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
compete with these canadian companies i
 
02:26:42.550 --> 02:26:42.560 align:start position:0%
lived there for a year and i worked for
 
02:26:45.190 --> 02:26:45.200 align:start position:0%
a canadian company back in the 1970s
 
02:26:47.510 --> 02:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
they get free electricity from the
 
02:26:49.349 --> 02:26:49.359 align:start position:0%
government so the the plant doesn't
 
02:26:51.670 --> 02:26:51.680 align:start position:0%
spend that they get free health care so
 
02:26:53.830 --> 02:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
even though that's a cost the the
 
02:26:56.070 --> 02:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
company itself is not spending that cost
 
02:26:57.830 --> 02:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
they get tax credits
 
02:26:59.750 --> 02:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
they're they're generally 10 to 20
 
02:27:01.429 --> 02:27:01.439 align:start position:0%
percent cheaper than
 
02:27:03.349 --> 02:27:03.359 align:start position:0%
the american companies and and we're not
 
02:27:07.110 --> 02:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
asking to make a law to prohibit trade
 
02:27:08.710 --> 02:27:08.720 align:start position:0%
this is only
 
02:27:10.950 --> 02:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
public projects which is only about five
 
02:27:13.030 --> 02:27:13.040 align:start position:0%
percent of the work in new hampshire the
 
02:27:14.870 --> 02:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
other 95 percent are still private
 
02:27:16.710 --> 02:27:16.720 align:start position:0%
projects there's there's nothing
 
02:27:18.230 --> 02:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
you know we're not restricting free
 
02:27:19.590 --> 02:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
enterprise there's really nothing you
 
02:27:21.750 --> 02:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
can do in regard to private industry
 
02:27:24.070 --> 02:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
we're just asking that that our tax
 
02:27:26.710 --> 02:27:26.720 align:start position:0%
dollars go to support american
 
02:27:29.190 --> 02:27:29.200 align:start position:0%
businesses just like all the other
 
02:27:31.990 --> 02:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
countries due to us the provinces in in
 
02:27:34.230 --> 02:27:34.240 align:start position:0%
canada do the same thing that we're just
 
02:27:36.150 --> 02:27:36.160 align:start position:0%
we just want to get a level playing
 
02:27:36.160 --> 02:27:38.309 align:start position:0%
we just want to get a level playing
field

02:27:38.309 --> 02:27:38.319 align:start position:0%
field
 
02:27:40.070 --> 02:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
so thank you for your time okay thank
 
02:27:42.469 --> 02:27:42.479 align:start position:0%
you very much are there any questions
 
02:27:45.190 --> 02:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
representative marsh uh the same
 
02:27:46.550 --> 02:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
question i asked the other guys do you
 
02:27:48.309 --> 02:27:48.319 align:start position:0%
know where you get your raw material
 
02:27:48.319 --> 02:27:49.190 align:start position:0%
know where you get your raw material
from

02:27:49.190 --> 02:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:27:50.309 --> 02:27:50.319 align:start position:0%
oh sure
 
02:27:50.319 --> 02:27:51.190 align:start position:0%
oh sure
so

02:27:51.190 --> 02:27:51.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:27:53.429 --> 02:27:53.439 align:start position:0%
when we lived in pittsburgh there were
 
02:27:54.710 --> 02:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
so now
 
02:27:56.630 --> 02:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
now where did you get your raw material
 
02:27:58.870 --> 02:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
we get it in in steel mills from the
 
02:28:01.110 --> 02:28:01.120 align:start position:0%
midwest and the south
 
02:28:03.270 --> 02:28:03.280 align:start position:0%
and i don't want to see what happened
 
02:28:05.670 --> 02:28:05.680 align:start position:0%
in pittsburgh happened to new hampshire
 
02:28:07.510 --> 02:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
because when we lived there there were
 
02:28:09.910 --> 02:28:09.920 align:start position:0%
60 operating steel mills there were 88
 
02:28:12.150 --> 02:28:12.160 align:start position:0%
operating blast furnaces there's one
 
02:28:13.990 --> 02:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
blast furnace left
 
02:28:16.790 --> 02:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
and it all went to the south
 
02:28:18.790 --> 02:28:18.800 align:start position:0%
and right now we're being beat out of
 
02:28:21.349 --> 02:28:21.359 align:start position:0%
all the work from canadians to the north
 
02:28:23.270 --> 02:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
and and i i you know i've been in this
 
02:28:25.110 --> 02:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
business for 45 years and i've seen what
 
02:28:27.990 --> 02:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
can happen and i'm just afraid that our
 
02:28:30.070 --> 02:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
our industry we're not going to have
 
02:28:30.080 --> 02:28:31.190 align:start position:0%
our industry we're not going to have
a

02:28:31.190 --> 02:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:28:34.150 --> 02:28:34.160 align:start position:0%
uh a steel industry in the united states
 
02:28:36.150 --> 02:28:36.160 align:start position:0%
compared to what we do have you you are
 
02:28:38.070 --> 02:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
probably familiar with the uh with the
 
02:28:40.309 --> 02:28:40.319 align:start position:0%
offshore wind projects that are coming
 
02:28:42.230 --> 02:28:42.240 align:start position:0%
there's a cape wind in massachusetts
 
02:28:44.870 --> 02:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
that's going to build 144 offshore wind
 
02:28:46.469 --> 02:28:46.479 align:start position:0%
towers those are going to come from
 
02:28:46.479 --> 02:28:48.150 align:start position:0%
towers those are going to come from
spain

02:28:48.150 --> 02:28:48.160 align:start position:0%
spain
 
02:28:49.830 --> 02:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
when i was growing up in pittsburgh it
 
02:28:51.349 --> 02:28:51.359 align:start position:0%
would have come from the united states
 
02:28:53.030 --> 02:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
because we were the leader in large
 
02:28:55.030 --> 02:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
structures no one can make that anymore
 
02:28:57.110 --> 02:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
it's going to come from spain and that's
 
02:28:58.550 --> 02:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen to our industry
 
02:29:01.429 --> 02:29:01.439 align:start position:0%
if we don't do something
 
02:29:03.510 --> 02:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
02:29:08.389 --> 02:29:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:08.399 --> 02:29:09.910 align:start position:0%
 
two

02:29:09.910 --> 02:29:09.920 align:start position:0%
two
 
02:29:11.990 --> 02:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
president blackest you have a question
 
02:29:14.150 --> 02:29:14.160 align:start position:0%
i do thank you uh madam chair
 
02:29:16.389 --> 02:29:16.399 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:29:17.830 --> 02:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
i mean i've heard from you and a number
 
02:29:20.389 --> 02:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
of the other people that um
 
02:29:22.389 --> 02:29:22.399 align:start position:0%
because you're being undercut by foreign
 
02:29:24.150 --> 02:29:24.160 align:start position:0%
producers because they're apparently
 
02:29:25.910 --> 02:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
being subsidized
 
02:29:25.920 --> 02:29:26.950 align:start position:0%
being subsidized
um

02:29:26.950 --> 02:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:28.950 --> 02:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
you're not able to win bids
 
02:29:30.790 --> 02:29:30.800 align:start position:0%
um on the other hand so you're wanting
 
02:29:33.510 --> 02:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
to you know preference for um
 
02:29:35.429 --> 02:29:35.439 align:start position:0%
large state contracts
 
02:29:37.190 --> 02:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
but and you said those are about five
 
02:29:37.200 --> 02:29:38.230 align:start position:0%
but and you said those are about five
percent

02:29:38.230 --> 02:29:38.240 align:start position:0%
percent
 
02:29:41.429 --> 02:29:41.439 align:start position:0%
of the steel fabrication business in new
 
02:29:41.439 --> 02:29:43.270 align:start position:0%
of the steel fabrication business in new
hampshire

02:29:43.270 --> 02:29:43.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:29:43.280 --> 02:29:44.790 align:start position:0%
hampshire
but

02:29:44.790 --> 02:29:44.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:29:47.110 --> 02:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
somehow those don't jive for me because
 
02:29:49.270 --> 02:29:49.280 align:start position:0%
how can any of you be in business right
 
02:29:52.710 --> 02:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
now if you can't compete on any projects
 
02:29:54.309 --> 02:29:54.319 align:start position:0%
even if we did this
 
02:29:55.750 --> 02:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
you know for five percent of the
 
02:29:57.910 --> 02:29:57.920 align:start position:0%
projects in the state how is that gonna
 
02:30:00.230 --> 02:30:00.240 align:start position:0%
uh save any of these businesses i don't
 
02:30:02.389 --> 02:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
see it so you could answer that for me
 
02:30:04.870 --> 02:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
yeah sure so so we sort of get like the
 
02:30:07.910 --> 02:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
leftovers and the dregs from a project
 
02:30:10.070 --> 02:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
like i recently did a large project at
 
02:30:13.190 --> 02:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
colby college in in maine and it was you
 
02:30:15.750 --> 02:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
know a 2000 ton steel project and we got
 
02:30:18.150 --> 02:30:18.160 align:start position:0%
to fabricate the stairs because super
 
02:30:20.710 --> 02:30:20.720 align:start position:0%
metals in canada got the main structure
 
02:30:22.870 --> 02:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
and i'm doing a project right now in
 
02:30:24.469 --> 02:30:24.479 align:start position:0%
woburn massachusetts where we're going
 
02:30:26.710 --> 02:30:26.720 align:start position:0%
to fabricate the stairs and the railings
 
02:30:28.389 --> 02:30:28.399 align:start position:0%
because the superstructure is being done
 
02:30:31.590 --> 02:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
by both both atlas and canada and and
 
02:30:33.910 --> 02:30:33.920 align:start position:0%
that's happening on on many many
 
02:30:37.270 --> 02:30:37.280 align:start position:0%
projects if it's a smaller project
 
02:30:39.830 --> 02:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
we'll have a a better chance to get it
 
02:30:42.950 --> 02:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
because someone always not as interested
 
02:30:45.110 --> 02:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
in but the larger projects especially
 
02:30:47.110 --> 02:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
the projects that some of my competitors
 
02:30:49.190 --> 02:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
here bid that are bigger than our plant
 
02:30:51.110 --> 02:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
if there's a large project and it's
 
02:30:53.750 --> 02:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
private they don't even bother to bid if
 
02:30:55.110 --> 02:30:55.120 align:start position:0%
there's a canadian bidder because they
 
02:30:58.870 --> 02:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:00.710 --> 02:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
02:31:01.830 --> 02:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
02:31:03.429 --> 02:31:03.439 align:start position:0%
representative scitec
 
02:31:05.590 --> 02:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
look i'm i'm with you i'm sitting on
 
02:31:07.110 --> 02:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
this side of the table but i'm an
 
02:31:09.590 --> 02:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
american i don't like the anything
 
02:31:11.750 --> 02:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
all the things you're talking about but
 
02:31:13.910 --> 02:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
what at school do i say it's school
 
02:31:16.710 --> 02:31:16.720 align:start position:0%
district meeting when i say
 
02:31:18.950 --> 02:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
when the bids come in
 
02:31:20.630 --> 02:31:20.640 align:start position:0%
and they're cheaper we're going to say
 
02:31:23.110 --> 02:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
it's a dollar fifty how do we
 
02:31:24.950 --> 02:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
well the taxpayer doesn't care about
 
02:31:26.710 --> 02:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
that he's looking at his tax bill well
 
02:31:28.469 --> 02:31:28.479 align:start position:0%
that's true but let me just give you an
 
02:31:30.150 --> 02:31:30.160 align:start position:0%
example um
 
02:31:30.160 --> 02:31:33.030 align:start position:0%
example um
let's

02:31:33.030 --> 02:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:36.230 --> 02:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
please briefly okay so suppose suppose
 
02:31:39.030 --> 02:31:39.040 align:start position:0%
the bid for the steel is uh
 
02:31:40.950 --> 02:31:40.960 align:start position:0%
is a million dollars
 
02:31:44.389 --> 02:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
the project's 10 million dollars okay
 
02:31:47.270 --> 02:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
my bid is is a million one
 
02:31:49.429 --> 02:31:49.439 align:start position:0%
that's a hundred thousand dollars extra
 
02:31:51.349 --> 02:31:51.359 align:start position:0%
they give it to the low bidder from from
 
02:31:53.429 --> 02:31:53.439 align:start position:0%
canada for a million dollars they saved
 
02:31:55.429 --> 02:31:55.439 align:start position:0%
a hundred thousand dollars on a 10
 
02:31:57.510 --> 02:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
million dollar project which is one
 
02:31:59.349 --> 02:31:59.359 align:start position:0%
percent but
 
02:32:01.750 --> 02:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
if it's awarded to our company for a
 
02:32:03.030 --> 02:32:03.040 align:start position:0%
million one
 
02:32:05.349 --> 02:32:05.359 align:start position:0%
a dollar for every dollar spent here a
 
02:32:07.110 --> 02:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
dollar fifty goes back into the local
 
02:32:10.389 --> 02:32:10.399 align:start position:0%
economy so a million five went back into
 
02:32:11.990 --> 02:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
the local economy
 
02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:12.790 align:start position:0%
the local economy
so

02:32:12.790 --> 02:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:32:14.710 --> 02:32:14.720 align:start position:0%
yes the taxpayers
 
02:32:16.950 --> 02:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
saved a hundred thousand but a million
 
02:32:18.710 --> 02:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
five went back into the local economy
 
02:32:20.389 --> 02:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
and everybody paid taxes on that and
 
02:32:22.469 --> 02:32:22.479 align:start position:0%
everybody was unemployed
 
02:32:24.710 --> 02:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
so there's a cost benefit
 
02:32:26.469 --> 02:32:26.479 align:start position:0%
yeah and you know someone smarter than
 
02:32:28.630 --> 02:32:28.640 align:start position:0%
me would have to do the calculation
 
02:32:30.469 --> 02:32:30.479 align:start position:0%
for the cost benefit but there's a big
 
02:32:31.830 --> 02:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
cost benefit
 
02:32:33.750 --> 02:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
when we're looking at a very small part
 
02:32:36.830 --> 02:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
of the project that would get awarded
 
02:32:40.630 --> 02:32:40.640 align:start position:0%
here thank you other questions
 
02:32:42.150 --> 02:32:42.160 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none
 
02:32:52.309 --> 02:32:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:54.230 --> 02:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you chairman
 
02:32:54.240 --> 02:32:55.510 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you chairman
chairperson

02:32:55.510 --> 02:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
chairperson
 
02:32:56.790 --> 02:32:56.800 align:start position:0%
and vice chair
 
02:32:58.710 --> 02:32:58.720 align:start position:0%
for allowing me to speak today on in
 
02:32:59.750 --> 02:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
support of
 
02:33:01.830 --> 02:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
senate bill 438
 
02:33:04.070 --> 02:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
before i jump into this can i answer
 
02:33:05.190 --> 02:33:05.200 align:start position:0%
some of the questions that have been
 
02:33:06.389 --> 02:33:06.399 align:start position:0%
floating around
 
02:33:07.990 --> 02:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
please that would probably be much more
 
02:33:09.270 --> 02:33:09.280 align:start position:0%
useful than you're reading your
 
02:33:12.309 --> 02:33:12.319 align:start position:0%
testimony okay so we do not have mills
 
02:33:13.830 --> 02:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire we're all structural
 
02:33:17.030 --> 02:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
steel fabricators we buy our mills our
 
02:33:19.270 --> 02:33:19.280 align:start position:0%
material domestically
 
02:33:21.349 --> 02:33:21.359 align:start position:0%
from the domestic mills our domestic
 
02:33:21.359 --> 02:33:22.309 align:start position:0%
from the domestic mills our domestic
mills

02:33:22.309 --> 02:33:22.319 align:start position:0%
mills
 
02:33:24.469 --> 02:33:24.479 align:start position:0%
are the greenest in the country in the
 
02:33:24.479 --> 02:33:25.990 align:start position:0%
are the greenest in the country in the
world

02:33:25.990 --> 02:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
world
 
02:33:28.710 --> 02:33:28.720 align:start position:0%
if you buy steel from outside chinese
 
02:33:31.030 --> 02:33:31.040 align:start position:0%
steel for instance russian steel they
 
02:33:32.950 --> 02:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
don't have the same environmental
 
02:33:36.150 --> 02:33:36.160 align:start position:0%
standards or safety standards that we
 
02:33:38.150 --> 02:33:38.160 align:start position:0%
install we have instill here in the
 
02:33:40.309 --> 02:33:40.319 align:start position:0%
united states our steel is
 
02:33:42.950 --> 02:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
90 i think it's 96
 
02:33:44.710 --> 02:33:44.720 align:start position:0%
recycled material
 
02:33:47.110 --> 02:33:47.120 align:start position:0%
um so we are the greenest and we buy
 
02:33:48.870 --> 02:33:48.880 align:start position:0%
from the mills the only time we don't
 
02:33:51.830 --> 02:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
buy domestically is if those sizes are
 
02:33:53.670 --> 02:33:53.680 align:start position:0%
not available
 
02:33:57.190 --> 02:33:57.200 align:start position:0%
because our mills don't produce them
 
02:34:00.150 --> 02:34:00.160 align:start position:0%
as far as canada and
 
02:34:01.670 --> 02:34:01.680 align:start position:0%
limiting the amount of steel that would
 
02:34:04.550 --> 02:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
come in from canada raw material canada
 
02:34:06.469 --> 02:34:06.479 align:start position:0%
does not have a mill
 
02:34:08.469 --> 02:34:08.479 align:start position:0%
they only produce two but they do not
 
02:34:10.630 --> 02:34:10.640 align:start position:0%
produce structural steel in any mill
 
02:34:13.510 --> 02:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
they do not have any mills in canada
 
02:34:13.520 --> 02:34:14.469 align:start position:0%
they do not have any mills in canada
um

02:34:14.469 --> 02:34:14.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:18.389 --> 02:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
what else as far as your concern about
 
02:34:20.309 --> 02:34:20.319 align:start position:0%
what what can this bill do really to
 
02:34:24.550 --> 02:34:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:27.349 --> 02:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
the the canadians and the foreign the
 
02:34:29.590 --> 02:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
foreign fabricators really have targeted
 
02:34:32.070 --> 02:34:32.080 align:start position:0%
our market significantly they go after
 
02:34:35.910 --> 02:34:35.920 align:start position:0%
the larger jobs the smaller jobs
 
02:34:37.910 --> 02:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
less than a couple hundred tons they
 
02:34:40.230 --> 02:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
really don't deal with
 
02:34:43.270 --> 02:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
my company a sweet spot for us but we
 
02:34:45.190 --> 02:34:45.200 align:start position:0%
are really good at doing is fifteen
 
02:34:47.190 --> 02:34:47.200 align:start position:0%
hundred three thou fifteen hundred to
 
02:34:49.750 --> 02:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
three thousand ton jobs your schools
 
02:34:52.550 --> 02:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
your hospitals your water treatment
 
02:34:55.349 --> 02:34:55.359 align:start position:0%
facilities the high rises in boston
 
02:34:57.750 --> 02:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
but those are all being taken by foreign
 
02:35:00.950 --> 02:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
fabricators so now i am forced to eat
 
02:35:03.510 --> 02:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
into smaller and smaller markets i have
 
02:35:06.309 --> 02:35:06.319 align:start position:0%
been living on the last couple years on
 
02:35:10.550 --> 02:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
30 tons 50 ton jobs i am eating into the
 
02:35:13.429 --> 02:35:13.439 align:start position:0%
mom and pop fabricators and going to be
 
02:35:15.110 --> 02:35:15.120 align:start position:0%
pushing them out
 
02:35:17.510 --> 02:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
because they can't compete against me
 
02:35:19.429 --> 02:35:19.439 align:start position:0%
because i can't compete against the
 
02:35:22.469 --> 02:35:22.479 align:start position:0%
foreign fabricators so what you do
 
02:35:26.230 --> 02:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
is all downstream you save our public
 
02:35:26.240 --> 02:35:27.429 align:start position:0%
is all downstream you save our public
dollars

02:35:27.429 --> 02:35:27.439 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:35:29.910 --> 02:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
our public construction that we as
 
02:35:32.950 --> 02:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
taxpayers as you as taxpayers are paying
 
02:35:35.910 --> 02:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
if you allow that to go domestic
 
02:35:37.670 --> 02:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
and those are the larger jobs the
 
02:35:41.349 --> 02:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
schools the libraries that people the
 
02:35:43.830 --> 02:35:43.840 align:start position:0%
fabricators here
 
02:35:47.030 --> 02:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
build you're saving the mom and pops
 
02:35:48.950 --> 02:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
because we're not eating into their
 
02:35:52.389 --> 02:35:52.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:54.389 --> 02:35:54.399 align:start position:0%
i can read you my testimony i have given
 
02:35:55.830 --> 02:35:55.840 align:start position:0%
you a copy
 
02:35:58.230 --> 02:35:58.240 align:start position:0%
can i just highlight one last piece yes
 
02:36:00.950 --> 02:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
just that we would appreciate that okay
 
02:36:03.750 --> 02:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
so i wanted to give you an example
 
02:36:05.830 --> 02:36:05.840 align:start position:0%
of what happened of what this bill would
 
02:36:05.840 --> 02:36:07.670 align:start position:0%
of what happened of what this bill would
do

02:36:07.670 --> 02:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
do
 
02:36:11.190 --> 02:36:11.200 align:start position:0%
we recently bid the nashua middle school
 
02:36:12.710 --> 02:36:12.720 align:start position:0%
it's going to go it's a project that's
 
02:36:16.150 --> 02:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
going to go this summer
 
02:36:17.590 --> 02:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
we came in
 
02:36:17.600 --> 02:36:18.550 align:start position:0%
we came in
third

02:36:18.550 --> 02:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
third
 
02:36:21.429 --> 02:36:21.439 align:start position:0%
we were third to two canadians our bid
 
02:36:24.550 --> 02:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
was 6.9 million we lost it for half a
 
02:36:26.389 --> 02:36:26.399 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
02:36:28.469 --> 02:36:28.479 align:start position:0%
but what happened was
 
02:36:32.230 --> 02:36:32.240 align:start position:0%
the nashua bought the school for 6.4
 
02:36:35.190 --> 02:36:35.200 align:start position:0%
they saved half a million dollars 6.4
 
02:36:38.309 --> 02:36:38.319 align:start position:0%
million dollars went to canada
 
02:36:39.750 --> 02:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
if you had
 
02:36:42.230 --> 02:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
if they had bought the steel from us for
 
02:36:46.790 --> 02:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
6.9 they would have paid 6.9 and had 8.5
 
02:36:48.870 --> 02:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
million reinvested in the local
 
02:36:53.670 --> 02:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
community through the multiplier effect
 
02:36:56.469 --> 02:36:56.479 align:start position:0%
they had a choice to make they lost
 
02:37:00.630 --> 02:37:00.640 align:start position:0%
6.4 in in reinvestment they lost 98.4 in
 
02:37:04.790 --> 02:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
reinvestment by saving half a million
 
02:37:07.349 --> 02:37:07.359 align:start position:0%
but that's that's in my testimony so any
 
02:37:07.359 --> 02:37:10.630 align:start position:0%
but that's that's in my testimony so any
questions

02:37:10.630 --> 02:37:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:11.990 --> 02:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
no i think you covered it very
 
02:37:14.469 --> 02:37:14.479 align:start position:0%
thoroughly thank you very much
 
02:37:22.790 --> 02:37:22.800 align:start position:0%

i'm asking your support on the
 
02:37:46.070 --> 02:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
of the senate bill 438 an act
 
02:37:48.150 --> 02:37:48.160 align:start position:0%
established in state procurement
 
02:37:50.790 --> 02:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
policies intended to promote
 
02:37:53.510 --> 02:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
the use of american materials
 
02:37:56.870 --> 02:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
sb 438 ensures that publicly funded
 
02:37:56.880 --> 02:37:58.389 align:start position:0%

american-made and american fabricated

structural steel
 
02:38:06.070 --> 02:38:06.080 align:start position:0%
our public tax dollars
 
02:38:08.710 --> 02:38:08.720 align:start position:0%
needs to support american workers in
 
02:38:11.190 --> 02:38:11.200 align:start position:0%
local economies
 
02:38:13.349 --> 02:38:13.359 align:start position:0%
as part of structural the structural
 
02:38:15.750 --> 02:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
steel erection company i've seen time
 
02:38:17.750 --> 02:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
and time again publicly funded
 
02:38:20.150 --> 02:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
construction projects of our critical
 
02:38:20.160 --> 02:38:22.469 align:start position:0%
construction projects of our critical
infrastructure

02:38:22.469 --> 02:38:22.479 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
02:38:24.309 --> 02:38:24.319 align:start position:0%
be erected with foreign fabricated
 
02:38:26.790 --> 02:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
structural steel schools hospitals
 
02:38:29.030 --> 02:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
libraries universities
 
02:38:31.030 --> 02:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
and more constructed with foreign
 
02:38:33.670 --> 02:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
fabricated structural steel
 
02:38:35.429 --> 02:38:35.439 align:start position:0%
our tax dollars that pay for these
 
02:38:37.750 --> 02:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
projects do not get reinvested into our
 
02:38:40.469 --> 02:38:40.479 align:start position:0%
domestic companies american workers in
 
02:38:42.389 --> 02:38:42.399 align:start position:0%
local communities
 
02:38:44.550 --> 02:38:44.560 align:start position:0%
instead those tax dollars
 
02:38:47.190 --> 02:38:47.200 align:start position:0%
get paid to the foreign fabricators who
 
02:38:49.590 --> 02:38:49.600 align:start position:0%
take our tax dollars out of country and
 
02:38:53.510 --> 02:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:54.710 --> 02:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
i think you
 
02:38:57.590 --> 02:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
should try to support this sb 438 and
 
02:39:00.550 --> 02:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
let our public tax paid dollars support
 
02:39:02.790 --> 02:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
tax paying americans in our communities
 
02:39:04.870 --> 02:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
that actually generated
 
02:39:07.349 --> 02:39:07.359 align:start position:0%
the money for the public dollars to be
 
02:39:07.359 --> 02:39:10.309 align:start position:0%
the money for the public dollars to be
spent

02:39:10.309 --> 02:39:10.319 align:start position:0%
spent
 
02:39:11.910 --> 02:39:11.920 align:start position:0%

members of house edna
 
03:03:04.070 --> 03:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is sharon carson
 
03:03:06.469 --> 03:03:06.479 align:start position:0%
and i represent senate district 14
 
03:03:08.309 --> 03:03:08.319 align:start position:0%
comprising the towns of londonderry
 
03:03:10.469 --> 03:03:10.479 align:start position:0%
hudson and auburn and i have for your
 
03:03:12.550 --> 03:03:12.560 align:start position:0%
consideration this afternoon senate bill
 
03:03:15.670 --> 03:03:15.680 align:start position:0%
443 relative to municipal authority
 
03:03:18.469 --> 03:03:18.479 align:start position:0%
regarding the state building code um
 
03:03:20.309 --> 03:03:20.319 align:start position:0%
this might sound a little familiar
 
03:03:22.630 --> 03:03:22.640 align:start position:0%
because i was in here in your committee
 
03:03:24.070 --> 03:03:24.080 align:start position:0%
earlier this week
 
03:03:26.550 --> 03:03:26.560 align:start position:0%
and there was a section in there dealing
 
03:03:27.990 --> 03:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
with this issue
 
03:03:30.469 --> 03:03:30.479 align:start position:0%
and i hope that you folks will consider
 
03:03:32.870 --> 03:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
the fact that um
 
03:03:34.950 --> 03:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
we feel that this is a strongly about
 
03:03:38.309 --> 03:03:38.319 align:start position:0%
this issue so you're seeing it again
 
03:03:39.910 --> 03:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
this bill provides that the building
 
03:03:42.309 --> 03:03:42.319 align:start position:0%
code review board shall review proposed
 
03:03:44.070 --> 03:03:44.080 align:start position:0%
municipal amendments to the state
 
03:03:46.150 --> 03:03:46.160 align:start position:0%
building code to confirm that the
 
03:03:48.309 --> 03:03:48.319 align:start position:0%
proposed amendments do not conflict with
 
03:03:50.150 --> 03:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
and are no less stringent than the state
 
03:03:52.950 --> 03:03:52.960 align:start position:0%
building code this bill also clarifies
 
03:03:54.790 --> 03:03:54.800 align:start position:0%
that fee schedules are not considered
 
03:03:57.349 --> 03:03:57.359 align:start position:0%
amendments to the code and that no fee
 
03:03:59.590 --> 03:03:59.600 align:start position:0%
shall be required to appeal a notice of
 
03:04:01.830 --> 03:04:01.840 align:start position:0%
code violation
 
03:04:03.830 --> 03:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
just again to just give a little bit of
 
03:04:03.840 --> 03:04:05.510 align:start position:0%
just again to just give a little bit of
background

03:04:05.510 --> 03:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
background
 
03:04:08.630 --> 03:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
back in i believe 2018
 
03:04:10.630 --> 03:04:10.640 align:start position:0%
there was a study committee to look at
 
03:04:13.670 --> 03:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
this because we were getting a lot of
 
03:04:17.110 --> 03:04:17.120 align:start position:0%
complaints from the tradespersons
 
03:04:20.070 --> 03:04:20.080 align:start position:0%
that municipalities were adopting
 
03:04:23.030 --> 03:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
codes through ordinance that were
 
03:04:25.110 --> 03:04:25.120 align:start position:0%
really in conflict with state building
 
03:04:25.120 --> 03:04:26.150 align:start position:0%
really in conflict with state building
codes

03:04:26.150 --> 03:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
codes
 
03:04:29.190 --> 03:04:29.200 align:start position:0%
and or they had gone above those
 
03:04:31.190 --> 03:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
building codes or they weren't up to
 
03:04:33.830 --> 03:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
date and as you know the state for quite
 
03:04:36.550 --> 03:04:36.560 align:start position:0%
a while had some issues dealing with
 
03:04:38.630 --> 03:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
state building codes
 
03:04:38.640 --> 03:04:39.590 align:start position:0%
state building codes
and

03:04:39.590 --> 03:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:04:41.349 --> 03:04:41.359 align:start position:0%
it was at that subcommittee that we
 
03:04:44.150 --> 03:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
started to lay the path to move forward
 
03:04:47.269 --> 03:04:47.279 align:start position:0%
so we could get a timely
 
03:04:49.510 --> 03:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
a timely adoption of the building codes
 
03:04:52.230 --> 03:04:52.240 align:start position:0%
so we weren't so far behind
 
03:04:54.309 --> 03:04:54.319 align:start position:0%
but one of the issues that came forward
 
03:04:56.950 --> 03:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
again was the fact about the municipal
 
03:04:58.630 --> 03:04:58.640 align:start position:0%
building codes
 
03:05:00.870 --> 03:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:05:03.190 --> 03:05:03.200 align:start position:0%
we had decided that we were going to put
 
03:05:05.349 --> 03:05:05.359 align:start position:0%
a process in place to deal with the
 
03:05:08.070 --> 03:05:08.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities that legislation was
 
03:05:08.080 --> 03:05:09.349 align:start position:0%
municipalities that legislation was
filed

03:05:09.349 --> 03:05:09.359 align:start position:0%
filed
 
03:05:12.150 --> 03:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
and it was actually heard in 2019
 
03:05:14.870 --> 03:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
but unfortunately it was put into an
 
03:05:16.870 --> 03:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
omnibus bill that
 
03:05:19.590 --> 03:05:19.600 align:start position:0%
was quite frankly overwhelming i believe
 
03:05:21.910 --> 03:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
it had over 40 bills
 
03:05:24.870 --> 03:05:24.880 align:start position:0%
that had been combined into one and
 
03:05:27.510 --> 03:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
the range of those bills was
 
03:05:28.870 --> 03:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
just about everything that you could
 
03:05:28.880 --> 03:05:29.910 align:start position:0%
just about everything that you could
imagine

03:05:29.910 --> 03:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
imagine
 
03:05:31.349 --> 03:05:31.359 align:start position:0%
and the house
 
03:05:33.510 --> 03:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
rejected that omnibus bill
 
03:05:35.590 --> 03:05:35.600 align:start position:0%
um i was asked to bring this forward
 
03:05:38.550 --> 03:05:38.560 align:start position:0%
again this year so that's why
 
03:05:41.750 --> 03:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
we have the legislation in front of us
 
03:05:44.870 --> 03:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
um so at this point i think i will
 
03:05:47.110 --> 03:05:47.120 align:start position:0%
ask some questions i answer questions if
 
03:05:48.150 --> 03:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
i can
 
03:05:50.309 --> 03:05:50.319 align:start position:0%
but the folks from the building code
 
03:05:52.950 --> 03:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
board are here as well as some of the
 
03:05:52.960 --> 03:05:54.070 align:start position:0%
board are here as well as some of the
tradesmen

03:05:54.070 --> 03:05:54.080 align:start position:0%
tradesmen
 
03:05:56.790 --> 03:05:56.800 align:start position:0%
and women and i think
 
03:05:58.550 --> 03:05:58.560 align:start position:0%
we should really listen to what the
 
03:06:00.950 --> 03:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
trades men and women have to say because
 
03:06:02.630 --> 03:06:02.640 align:start position:0%
they're the ones that have to deal with
 
03:06:03.910 --> 03:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
the code
 
03:06:05.670 --> 03:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
and one of the things we wanted to do
 
03:06:07.349 --> 03:06:07.359 align:start position:0%
was have a unified code where there
 
03:06:09.269 --> 03:06:09.279 align:start position:0%
would be one place
 
03:06:11.510 --> 03:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
where a tradesperson could go to to find
 
03:06:13.429 --> 03:06:13.439 align:start position:0%
out what were the codes in every
 
03:06:15.910 --> 03:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
community as well as the state and i
 
03:06:18.790 --> 03:06:18.800 align:start position:0%
believe the adoption of this would help
 
03:06:20.389 --> 03:06:20.399 align:start position:0%
help that process
 
03:06:20.399 --> 03:06:21.110 align:start position:0%
help that process
so

03:06:21.110 --> 03:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:06:22.870 --> 03:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much madam chair and i'll
 
03:06:26.550 --> 03:06:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:29.830 --> 03:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for the senator
 
03:06:34.950 --> 03:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:37.910 --> 03:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:39.750 --> 03:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
or sheman
 
03:06:45.429 --> 03:06:45.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:51.830 --> 03:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:53.510 --> 03:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
madam chair members of the committee my

name is philip sherman i speak as chair
 
03:06:57.190 --> 03:06:57.200 align:start position:0%
of the building code review board
 
03:07:00.070 --> 03:07:00.080 align:start position:0%
this bill as amended reflects many hours
 
03:07:01.590 --> 03:07:01.600 align:start position:0%
working with the new hampshire building
 
03:07:03.670 --> 03:07:03.680 align:start position:0%

03:07:06.150 --> 03:07:06.160 align:start position:0%

board as well as certain individuals who
 
03:07:21.510 --> 03:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
provided valuable input
 
03:07:23.110 --> 03:07:23.120 align:start position:0%
we've kept the state fire marshal
 
03:07:25.269 --> 03:07:25.279 align:start position:0%
informed along the way and it now
 
03:07:27.670 --> 03:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
reflects a consensus on an approach that
 
03:07:30.309 --> 03:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
i believe is acceptable to all
 
03:07:32.150 --> 03:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
the bill is amended by the senate
 
03:07:34.469 --> 03:07:34.479 align:start position:0%
addresses the original desire for some
 
03:07:37.110 --> 03:07:37.120 align:start position:0%
level of bcrb review of municipal
 
03:07:39.670 --> 03:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
amendments to the state building code
 
03:07:41.429 --> 03:07:41.439 align:start position:0%
and addresses both the timing of the
 
03:07:44.550 --> 03:07:44.560 align:start position:0%
submission for the bcrb review by cities
 
03:07:47.510 --> 03:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
and towns and the need to allow time for
 
03:07:50.830 --> 03:07:50.840 align:start position:0%
the bcrb itself to review the
 
03:07:54.230 --> 03:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
amendment the bill uses the term confirm
 
03:07:56.389 --> 03:07:56.399 align:start position:0%
to stress that our review is only for
 
03:07:58.070 --> 03:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
the purpose of confirming that a
 
03:08:00.469 --> 03:08:00.479 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment does not conflict
 
03:08:00.479 --> 03:08:01.590 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment does not conflict
with

03:08:01.590 --> 03:08:01.600 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:08:03.750 --> 03:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
and is no less stringent than the state
 
03:08:05.990 --> 03:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
building code and to confirm with the
 
03:08:07.510 --> 03:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
state fire marshal that it does not
 
03:08:09.990 --> 03:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
conflict with the state fire code
 
03:08:12.870 --> 03:08:12.880 align:start position:0%
the bill further clarifies that things
 
03:08:14.950 --> 03:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
reserved the local jurisdiction by
 
03:08:17.670 --> 03:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
statute such as fee schedules are not
 
03:08:19.990 --> 03:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
considered amendments and therefore do
 
03:08:22.950 --> 03:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
not need to come before the bcrb
 
03:08:25.429 --> 03:08:25.439 align:start position:0%
after the amendment is adopted locally
 
03:08:27.590 --> 03:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
the municipality is required to forward
 
03:08:30.070 --> 03:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
the procedural details of the adoption
 
03:08:32.630 --> 03:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
process in order to provide a high level
 
03:08:34.790 --> 03:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
check that an amendment was legally
 
03:08:34.800 --> 03:08:36.630 align:start position:0%
check that an amendment was legally
adopted

03:08:36.630 --> 03:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
adopted
 
03:08:38.710 --> 03:08:38.720 align:start position:0%
an important last point
 
03:08:40.790 --> 03:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
the bill defers the effective date until
 
03:08:44.630 --> 03:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
january 1st 2023 as the bcrb will need
 
03:08:46.550 --> 03:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
to update its rules to address this
 
03:08:48.870 --> 03:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
topic and it's clear that at least some
 
03:08:50.550 --> 03:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
cities and towns will need time to
 
03:08:52.630 --> 03:08:52.640 align:start position:0%
review their current ordinances and
 
03:08:55.190 --> 03:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
start the process of drafting updates
 
03:08:57.349 --> 03:08:57.359 align:start position:0%
prior to submitting to the bcrb for
 
03:08:57.359 --> 03:08:58.469 align:start position:0%
prior to submitting to the bcrb for
review

03:08:58.469 --> 03:08:58.479 align:start position:0%
review
 
03:09:01.030 --> 03:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
at least one city for instance has yet
 
03:09:03.510 --> 03:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
to update their ordinances to the 2015
 
03:09:03.520 --> 03:09:04.550 align:start position:0%
to update their ordinances to the 2015
codes

03:09:04.550 --> 03:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
codes
 
03:09:06.630 --> 03:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
there's the potential that the bcrb
 
03:09:08.710 --> 03:09:08.720 align:start position:0%
receives a large number of complicated
 
03:09:11.349 --> 03:09:11.359 align:start position:0%
amendments in a short time frame we look
 
03:09:12.870 --> 03:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
forward to working with the cities and
 
03:09:15.349 --> 03:09:15.359 align:start position:0%
towns during this interim period
 
03:09:17.030 --> 03:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
thank you in advance for your efforts on
 
03:09:18.550 --> 03:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
this and i'm happy to answer any
 
03:09:18.560 --> 03:09:20.389 align:start position:0%
this and i'm happy to answer any
questions

03:09:20.389 --> 03:09:20.399 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:09:22.469 --> 03:09:22.479 align:start position:0%
representative lacas thank you and thank
 
03:09:25.349 --> 03:09:25.359 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um i'm just
 
03:09:27.190 --> 03:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
wondering if there's been any ongoing
 
03:09:27.200 --> 03:09:28.550 align:start position:0%
wondering if there's been any ongoing
process

03:09:28.550 --> 03:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
process
 
03:09:31.110 --> 03:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
that's looked at um
 
03:09:32.870 --> 03:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
or you know municipal ordinances related
 
03:09:34.790 --> 03:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
to building codes to
 
03:09:37.030 --> 03:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
verify that they would be okay under
 
03:09:38.870 --> 03:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
this standard um
 
03:09:40.070 --> 03:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
you know the ones that are currently in
 
03:09:41.750 --> 03:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
existence because this appears only to
 
03:09:45.269 --> 03:09:45.279 align:start position:0%
address ones going forward
 
03:09:48.469 --> 03:09:48.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:50.389 --> 03:09:50.399 align:start position:0%
currently the cities and towns are
 
03:09:52.389 --> 03:09:52.399 align:start position:0%
simply required to
 
03:09:55.030 --> 03:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
send their amendments to the bcrb for
 
03:09:55.040 --> 03:09:56.389 align:start position:0%
send their amendments to the bcrb for
posting

03:09:56.389 --> 03:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
posting
 
03:09:59.670 --> 03:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
not for review i believe that the grand
 
03:10:02.229 --> 03:10:02.239 align:start position:0%
total of two cities or towns have done
 
03:10:02.239 --> 03:10:03.269 align:start position:0%
total of two cities or towns have done
so

03:10:03.269 --> 03:10:03.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:10:06.070 --> 03:10:06.080 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of catch-up to do here
 
03:10:08.469 --> 03:10:08.479 align:start position:0%
yeah uh follow-up
 
03:10:10.950 --> 03:10:10.960 align:start position:0%
will you say it's a grand total is that
 
03:10:13.429 --> 03:10:13.439 align:start position:0%
two that have made uh building code
 
03:10:16.389 --> 03:10:16.399 align:start position:0%
changes to their ordinances or two that
 
03:10:17.910 --> 03:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
uh sent them but others have made
 
03:10:19.750 --> 03:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
changes and not sent them which
 
03:10:22.070 --> 03:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
which is it two that have sent them to
 
03:10:24.070 --> 03:10:24.080 align:start position:0%
us i'm aware that there are many more
 
03:10:25.910 --> 03:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
that have made changes and not sent them
 
03:10:28.309 --> 03:10:28.319 align:start position:0%
to us okay thank you
 
03:10:30.550 --> 03:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt
 
03:10:32.950 --> 03:10:32.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:10:35.349 --> 03:10:35.359 align:start position:0%
so i want to follow up on representative
 
03:10:39.429 --> 03:10:39.439 align:start position:0%
leckus's uh question because that
 
03:10:41.990 --> 03:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
seems to be the salient point of this at
 
03:10:45.990 --> 03:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
this juncture and namely uh how much of
 
03:10:46.000 --> 03:10:46.950 align:start position:0%
this juncture and namely uh how much of
the

03:10:46.950 --> 03:10:46.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:10:46.960 --> 03:10:47.830 align:start position:0%
the
of

03:10:47.830 --> 03:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:10:49.750 --> 03:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
of the situation we have here where
 
03:10:52.070 --> 03:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of change is being made
 
03:10:53.750 --> 03:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
and potentially
 
03:10:56.630 --> 03:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
changes that violate the state building
 
03:10:56.640 --> 03:10:57.510 align:start position:0%
changes that violate the state building
code

03:10:57.510 --> 03:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
code
 
03:10:59.349 --> 03:10:59.359 align:start position:0%
it seems like
 
03:11:01.830 --> 03:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
that there has been effectively no or
 
03:11:03.830 --> 03:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
very little review of
 
03:11:05.830 --> 03:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
uh of the changes that are being made at
 
03:11:08.309 --> 03:11:08.319 align:start position:0%
the local level so can you speak to that
 
03:11:10.790 --> 03:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
general topic along the lines of what
 
03:11:13.910 --> 03:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
representatives has already started but
 
03:11:17.349 --> 03:11:17.359 align:start position:0%
uh my slight amendment if you will
 
03:11:18.550 --> 03:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
yeah i think
 
03:11:19.830 --> 03:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
you know you put your finger on the
 
03:11:22.389 --> 03:11:22.399 align:start position:0%
issue uh there there are two pieces to
 
03:11:23.750 --> 03:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
this one are
 
03:11:26.550 --> 03:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
uh officials who may be creating rules
 
03:11:27.990 --> 03:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
without going through the local
 
03:11:30.469 --> 03:11:30.479 align:start position:0%
ordinance process and others where
 
03:11:32.630 --> 03:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
ordinances may or may not be adopted
 
03:11:32.640 --> 03:11:33.349 align:start position:0%
ordinances may or may not be adopted
that

03:11:33.349 --> 03:11:33.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:11:35.750 --> 03:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
may be less stringent or
 
03:11:40.389 --> 03:11:40.399 align:start position:0%
improperly adopted relative to rsa 155a
 
03:11:43.349 --> 03:11:43.359 align:start position:0%
there's no statutory review by anybody
 
03:11:45.190 --> 03:11:45.200 align:start position:0%
at this point other than just to post
 
03:11:47.830 --> 03:11:47.840 align:start position:0%
them on the website so this closes that
 
03:11:50.790 --> 03:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
loop and provides at least a review and
 
03:11:50.800 --> 03:11:51.750 align:start position:0%
loop and provides at least a review and
and

03:11:51.750 --> 03:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:11:53.910 --> 03:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
confirmation prior
 
03:11:55.910 --> 03:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
effectiveness follow-up
 
03:11:59.110 --> 03:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
so obviously to the degree that that
 
03:12:02.229 --> 03:12:02.239 align:start position:0%
amendments to the state building code
 
03:12:04.550 --> 03:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
are made which are more stringent
 
03:12:06.070 --> 03:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
there's not a problem with that right
 
03:12:08.630 --> 03:12:08.640 align:start position:0%
they're entitled to do that as long as
 
03:12:11.510 --> 03:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
it's it meets the state building code
 
03:12:13.590 --> 03:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
they can have something more stringent
 
03:12:15.670 --> 03:12:15.680 align:start position:0%
that has been i was on the dover city
 
03:12:18.309 --> 03:12:18.319 align:start position:0%
council about 25 years ago and it's my
 
03:12:21.510 --> 03:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
recollection in that that we were
 
03:12:23.750 --> 03:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
informed we were trained to believe that
 
03:12:25.910 --> 03:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
we were okay to
 
03:12:28.550 --> 03:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh to make a more stringent unless the
 
03:12:31.349 --> 03:12:31.359 align:start position:0%
state preempted any action by the
 
03:12:33.349 --> 03:12:33.359 align:start position:0%
locality that was the case in some
 
03:12:36.229 --> 03:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
issues uh but uh but to the degree that
 
03:12:36.239 --> 03:12:37.110 align:start position:0%
issues uh but uh but to the degree that
there's

03:12:37.110 --> 03:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
there's
 
03:12:39.750 --> 03:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
essentially their post they're supposed
 
03:12:41.750 --> 03:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
to post them are they supposed to post
 
03:12:41.760 --> 03:12:43.910 align:start position:0%
to post them are they supposed to post
them

03:12:43.910 --> 03:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:45.349 --> 03:12:45.359 align:start position:0%
you said there are only two that have
 
03:12:46.389 --> 03:12:46.399 align:start position:0%
done that
 
03:12:48.309 --> 03:12:48.319 align:start position:0%
to the best of my knowledge
 
03:12:49.990 --> 03:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
currently you're absolutely right you
 
03:12:51.830 --> 03:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
can you can amend the code as long as
 
03:12:53.429 --> 03:12:53.439 align:start position:0%
it's more stringent and all you have to
 
03:12:55.670 --> 03:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
do is send them to us for informational
 
03:12:57.670 --> 03:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
purposes for posting
 
03:12:57.680 --> 03:12:59.269 align:start position:0%
purposes for posting
right

03:12:59.269 --> 03:12:59.279 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:13:01.910 --> 03:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
so follow up on that so but the the
 
03:13:04.469 --> 03:13:04.479 align:start position:0%
thing is that i i know you're a busy uh
 
03:13:06.710 --> 03:13:06.720 align:start position:0%
board uh i attended some of your
 
03:13:09.590 --> 03:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
meetings in the past uh and that it's a
 
03:13:11.429 --> 03:13:11.439 align:start position:0%
big board and it's uh
 
03:13:13.429 --> 03:13:13.439 align:start position:0%
very very active
 
03:13:16.550 --> 03:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
and very a lot of competent experienced
 
03:13:18.870 --> 03:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
people who would be excellent at
 
03:13:21.910 --> 03:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
reviewing and commenting on
 
03:13:24.229 --> 03:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
on local ordinances if they ever saw
 
03:13:24.239 --> 03:13:25.110 align:start position:0%
on local ordinances if they ever saw
them

03:13:25.110 --> 03:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:13:28.150 --> 03:13:28.160 align:start position:0%
the question is um
 
03:13:29.750 --> 03:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
it doesn't look like there's any review
 
03:13:31.269 --> 03:13:31.279 align:start position:0%
at all
 
03:13:33.670 --> 03:13:33.680 align:start position:0%
that's what this is intended to be
 
03:13:36.309 --> 03:13:36.319 align:start position:0%
however it's a narrowly focused review
 
03:13:38.550 --> 03:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
we're calling it confirmation
 
03:13:41.429 --> 03:13:41.439 align:start position:0%
we're not reviewing it for the technical
 
03:13:43.670 --> 03:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
appropriateness of that other than is it
 
03:13:45.269 --> 03:13:45.279 align:start position:0%
more stringent than the building code
 
03:13:47.030 --> 03:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
and does it conflict with the state fire
 
03:13:47.040 --> 03:13:48.070 align:start position:0%
and does it conflict with the state fire
code

03:13:48.070 --> 03:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
code
 
03:13:50.710 --> 03:13:50.720 align:start position:0%
if somebody wants to do this and we may
 
03:13:52.309 --> 03:13:52.319 align:start position:0%
or may not think they ought to do that
 
03:13:54.469 --> 03:13:54.479 align:start position:0%
that's not what this is about we have no
 
03:13:58.710 --> 03:13:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:01.110 --> 03:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
03:14:02.710 --> 03:14:02.720 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
03:14:15.750 --> 03:14:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:17.269 --> 03:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
 
03:14:21.590 --> 03:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
committee i'm carol mcguire merrimack 29
 
03:14:23.830 --> 03:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
and this came out during the study
 
03:14:26.309 --> 03:14:26.319 align:start position:0%
committee on state building codes that
 
03:14:28.710 --> 03:14:28.720 align:start position:0%
we enjoyed last year
 
03:14:31.190 --> 03:14:31.200 align:start position:0%
and one of the issues besides the fact
 
03:14:33.990 --> 03:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
that people don't know
 
03:14:36.309 --> 03:14:36.319 align:start position:0%
what the local changes to the building
 
03:14:39.590 --> 03:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
code may be is that
 
03:14:42.070 --> 03:14:42.080 align:start position:0%
a number of the building codes offer
 
03:14:43.910 --> 03:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
alternatives you can do
 
03:14:46.550 --> 03:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
you can do it with one type of conduit
 
03:14:47.910 --> 03:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
or you can do a different type of
 
03:14:50.309 --> 03:14:50.319 align:start position:0%
conduit and they have the details on how
 
03:14:52.229 --> 03:14:52.239 align:start position:0%
you deal with that particular type of
 
03:14:52.239 --> 03:14:54.309 align:start position:0%
you deal with that particular type of
conduit

03:14:54.309 --> 03:14:54.319 align:start position:0%
conduit
 
03:14:56.790 --> 03:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
and there either would be acceptable so
 
03:14:58.870 --> 03:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
it turned out i believe that was hollis
 
03:14:58.880 --> 03:15:01.349 align:start position:0%
it turned out i believe that was hollis
and

03:15:01.349 --> 03:15:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:04.229 --> 03:15:04.239 align:start position:0%
and some other town adjacent to hollis
 
03:15:06.950 --> 03:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
that had select had said in this town
 
03:15:09.670 --> 03:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
you will use option a and the other town
 
03:15:12.309 --> 03:15:12.319 align:start position:0%
said you will use option b
 
03:15:12.319 --> 03:15:13.510 align:start position:0%
said you will use option b
which

03:15:13.510 --> 03:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
which
 
03:15:15.190 --> 03:15:15.200 align:start position:0%
although they they were each
 
03:15:17.990 --> 03:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
individually technically acceptable it
 
03:15:20.389 --> 03:15:20.399 align:start position:0%
was a major confusion when you're going
 
03:15:22.550 --> 03:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
back and forth across the town lines to
 
03:15:22.560 --> 03:15:23.670 align:start position:0%
back and forth across the town lines to
say

03:15:23.670 --> 03:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
say
 
03:15:25.910 --> 03:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
you know why why is it
 
03:15:25.920 --> 03:15:27.910 align:start position:0%
you know why why is it
this

03:15:27.910 --> 03:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:15:29.990 --> 03:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
alternative is not acceptable in this
 
03:15:30.000 --> 03:15:31.030 align:start position:0%
alternative is not acceptable in this
town

03:15:31.030 --> 03:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
town
 
03:15:33.110 --> 03:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
and so that was
 
03:15:35.429 --> 03:15:35.439 align:start position:0%
an anecdotal problem that this will help
 
03:15:36.710 --> 03:15:36.720 align:start position:0%
to solve
 
03:15:39.510 --> 03:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
there are also many cases of where the
 
03:15:39.520 --> 03:15:40.790 align:start position:0%
there are also many cases of where the
town

03:15:40.790 --> 03:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
town
 
03:15:42.309 --> 03:15:42.319 align:start position:0%
makes a
 
03:15:43.910 --> 03:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
an ordinance
 
03:15:43.920 --> 03:15:44.790 align:start position:0%
an ordinance
that

03:15:44.790 --> 03:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:15:46.950 --> 03:15:46.960 align:start position:0%
you know seems good but it conflicts
 
03:15:48.790 --> 03:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
with with the one of the building codes
 
03:15:52.469 --> 03:15:52.479 align:start position:0%
or the fire code and there are no
 
03:15:54.950 --> 03:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
appropriately trained people
 
03:15:57.190 --> 03:15:57.200 align:start position:0%
who are approving it i mean i know my
 
03:15:59.110 --> 03:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
select board would not be capable of
 
03:16:00.550 --> 03:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
doing this
 
03:16:02.389 --> 03:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
and so they they come up with an
 
03:16:05.110 --> 03:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
ordinance that sounds good
 
03:16:08.229 --> 03:16:08.239 align:start position:0%
but is in conflict with state law and so
 
03:16:10.950 --> 03:16:10.960 align:start position:0%
that's what the intent of this
 
03:16:13.590 --> 03:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
of this bill is is to make sure
 
03:16:15.030 --> 03:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
that the
 
03:16:17.990 --> 03:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
local ordinances
 
03:16:20.469 --> 03:16:20.479 align:start position:0%
are not in conflict with the state
 
03:16:22.550 --> 03:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
building code
 
03:16:24.790 --> 03:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
they are available to people throughout
 
03:16:26.550 --> 03:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
the state who know what they are and
 
03:16:28.550 --> 03:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
that they are reviewed by people who are
 
03:16:31.110 --> 03:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable that can say
 
03:16:33.510 --> 03:16:33.520 align:start position:0%
you know this is this is in conflict
 
03:16:35.590 --> 03:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
with our state with the fire code in
 
03:16:37.750 --> 03:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
this section which you hadn't considered
 
03:16:37.760 --> 03:16:39.990 align:start position:0%
this section which you hadn't considered
or

03:16:39.990 --> 03:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:16:42.309 --> 03:16:42.319 align:start position:0%
you know your your next your next door
 
03:16:42.319 --> 03:16:43.269 align:start position:0%
you know your your next your next door
town

03:16:43.269 --> 03:16:43.279 align:start position:0%
town
 
03:16:45.269 --> 03:16:45.279 align:start position:0%
has picked the other option
 
03:16:47.750 --> 03:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
and is this really important
 
03:16:47.760 --> 03:16:49.670 align:start position:0%
and is this really important
but

03:16:49.670 --> 03:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:16:51.670 --> 03:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
the building code review board does not
 
03:16:54.950 --> 03:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
have the authority to
 
03:16:54.960 --> 03:16:56.150 align:start position:0%
have the authority to
cancel

03:16:56.150 --> 03:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
cancel
 
03:16:57.590 --> 03:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
they don't have to approve them they
 
03:16:59.830 --> 03:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
just have to say yes it's in it meets
 
03:17:02.550 --> 03:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
requirements you you town go ahead and
 
03:17:03.990 --> 03:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
adopt it
 
03:17:06.630 --> 03:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
uh for example i believe the town of
 
03:17:06.640 --> 03:17:07.670 align:start position:0%
uh for example i believe the town of
durham

03:17:07.670 --> 03:17:07.680 align:start position:0%
durham
 
03:17:11.269 --> 03:17:11.279 align:start position:0%
chose to relocate itself from
 
03:17:11.279 --> 03:17:12.630 align:start position:0%
chose to relocate itself from
climate

03:17:12.630 --> 03:17:12.640 align:start position:0%
climate
 
03:17:15.190 --> 03:17:15.200 align:start position:0%
zones five which at most the state is to
 
03:17:17.190 --> 03:17:17.200 align:start position:0%
climate zone six
 
03:17:18.630 --> 03:17:18.640 align:start position:0%
which would ensure
 
03:17:21.590 --> 03:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh greater insulation in the town well
 
03:17:23.590 --> 03:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
that's stricter than the built state
 
03:17:26.550 --> 03:17:26.560 align:start position:0%
building code and it would be
 
03:17:29.190 --> 03:17:29.200 align:start position:0%
be so reviewed and say yes you can do
 
03:17:31.269 --> 03:17:31.279 align:start position:0%
that that's within your authority but
 
03:17:33.670 --> 03:17:33.680 align:start position:0%
make sure everybody knows about it
 
03:17:33.680 --> 03:17:34.550 align:start position:0%
make sure everybody knows about it
and

03:17:34.550 --> 03:17:34.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:17:37.110 --> 03:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
so this is for
 
03:17:40.550 --> 03:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
consistency and transparency above all
 
03:17:43.670 --> 03:17:43.680 align:start position:0%
and i'll try to answer questions
 
03:17:45.030 --> 03:17:45.040 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman representative
 
03:17:45.040 --> 03:17:46.710 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman representative
schmidt

03:17:46.710 --> 03:17:46.720 align:start position:0%
schmidt
 
03:17:50.389 --> 03:17:50.399 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i'm so mad
 
03:17:52.070 --> 03:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
madam committee chair
 
03:17:54.870 --> 03:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
uh first of all in leading to my
 
03:17:56.469 --> 03:17:56.479 align:start position:0%
question i want to salute the fact that
 
03:17:58.550 --> 03:17:58.560 align:start position:0%
you have been paying a lot of attention
 
03:18:00.630 --> 03:18:00.640 align:start position:0%
and it seems to me like you're certainly
 
03:18:02.150 --> 03:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
have made yourself one of the more
 
03:18:04.630 --> 03:18:04.640 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable state legislators anyway
 
03:18:07.110 --> 03:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
with regard to such issues but i'm very
 
03:18:08.389 --> 03:18:08.399 align:start position:0%
concerned about
 
03:18:11.429 --> 03:18:11.439 align:start position:0%
uh the the the situation uh that with
 
03:18:14.870 --> 03:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
the small towns the the bigger cities
 
03:18:18.070 --> 03:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
i'm sure dover has a a building
 
03:18:18.080 --> 03:18:19.429 align:start position:0%
i'm sure dover has a a building
inspector

03:18:19.429 --> 03:18:19.439 align:start position:0%
inspector
 
03:18:21.110 --> 03:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
matter of fact i know who it used to be
 
03:18:23.910 --> 03:18:23.920 align:start position:0%
i don't know what it is at the moment um
 
03:18:23.920 --> 03:18:24.870 align:start position:0%
i don't know what it is at the moment um
and

03:18:24.870 --> 03:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:18:27.110 --> 03:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
and and it has an active inspection
 
03:18:28.309 --> 03:18:28.319 align:start position:0%
process and
 
03:18:30.870 --> 03:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
numerous requirements and so forth but
 
03:18:33.269 --> 03:18:33.279 align:start position:0%
the small towns very often is it not the
 
03:18:35.349 --> 03:18:35.359 align:start position:0%
case of the small towns it's the select
 
03:18:38.950 --> 03:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
board or one of the selectmen who is
 
03:18:41.030 --> 03:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
the building inspector
 
03:18:43.190 --> 03:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
that seems to me to be an awfully
 
03:18:45.429 --> 03:18:45.439 align:start position:0%
loosey-goosey situation can you talk
 
03:18:47.670 --> 03:18:47.680 align:start position:0%
about that well sure my town doesn't
 
03:18:49.670 --> 03:18:49.680 align:start position:0%
have we we don't have a building
 
03:18:51.750 --> 03:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
inspector as such we have a code
 
03:18:53.670 --> 03:18:53.680 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer
 
03:18:56.469 --> 03:18:56.479 align:start position:0%
who checks for a number of
 
03:18:59.110 --> 03:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
code enforcement issues
 
03:19:01.030 --> 03:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh when we were building our house we
 
03:19:02.830 --> 03:19:02.840 align:start position:0%
found out he checks for
 
03:19:05.750 --> 03:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
setbacks he checks for road
 
03:19:07.510 --> 03:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
driveway position
 
03:19:10.550 --> 03:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
location of the well and the septic
 
03:19:10.560 --> 03:19:11.590 align:start position:0%
location of the well and the septic
and

03:19:11.590 --> 03:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:19:13.910 --> 03:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
but the actual structure of the house
 
03:19:13.920 --> 03:19:15.429 align:start position:0%
but the actual structure of the house
was

03:19:15.429 --> 03:19:15.439 align:start position:0%
was
 
03:19:17.670 --> 03:19:17.680 align:start position:0%
the responsibility of the contractor and
 
03:19:21.269 --> 03:19:21.279 align:start position:0%
this bill would not change any of that
 
03:19:24.309 --> 03:19:24.319 align:start position:0%
and for example epsom would not even
 
03:19:26.389 --> 03:19:26.399 align:start position:0%
think about adopting
 
03:19:29.750 --> 03:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
an amendment to the state building code
 
03:19:31.349 --> 03:19:31.359 align:start position:0%
because we don't have any ability to
 
03:19:33.030 --> 03:19:33.040 align:start position:0%
enforce it and the building code is
 
03:19:36.309 --> 03:19:36.319 align:start position:0%
pretty is reasonable so we wouldn't we
 
03:19:38.710 --> 03:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't think about it the the i'm sure
 
03:19:40.309 --> 03:19:40.319 align:start position:0%
the amendments are coming from the
 
03:19:43.030 --> 03:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
cities in the larger towns
 
03:19:46.229 --> 03:19:46.239 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up so one of the issues
 
03:19:48.870 --> 03:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
that i'm also concerned about is
 
03:19:51.510 --> 03:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
i mean contractors and i'm i'll ask if
 
03:19:53.349 --> 03:19:53.359 align:start position:0%
any of them are going to be
 
03:19:55.750 --> 03:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
testifying i'll ask them the question
 
03:19:58.790 --> 03:19:58.800 align:start position:0%
but do the do the masters
 
03:20:01.030 --> 03:20:01.040 align:start position:0%
and even the journeymen do they not have
 
03:20:04.550 --> 03:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
an ethical co responsibility
 
03:20:07.590 --> 03:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
as members of profession with
 
03:20:07.600 --> 03:20:08.790 align:start position:0%
as members of profession with
a

03:20:08.790 --> 03:20:08.800 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:20:10.790 --> 03:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
code of ethics
 
03:20:12.630 --> 03:20:12.640 align:start position:0%
at least of a sort
 
03:20:12.640 --> 03:20:13.830 align:start position:0%
at least of a sort
to

03:20:13.830 --> 03:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:20:16.790 --> 03:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
abide by building code requirements
 
03:20:17.910 --> 03:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
yes they do
 
03:20:19.830 --> 03:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
and in fact when you sign a contract
 
03:20:21.910 --> 03:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
with a builder you generally agree on
 
03:20:25.030 --> 03:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
what building code you're going to use
 
03:20:28.550 --> 03:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
right i remember when with the when
 
03:20:31.030 --> 03:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
dover was building a
 
03:20:31.040 --> 03:20:31.990 align:start position:0%
dover was building a
a

03:20:31.990 --> 03:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:20:33.590 --> 03:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
community works
 
03:20:36.389 --> 03:20:36.399 align:start position:0%
facility we had a clerk of the works
 
03:20:39.349 --> 03:20:39.359 align:start position:0%
that was employed by the city to oversee
 
03:20:41.269 --> 03:20:41.279 align:start position:0%
the process
 
03:20:44.150 --> 03:20:44.160 align:start position:0%
of the construction and so forth and i
 
03:20:45.670 --> 03:20:45.680 align:start position:0%
as the chairman of that
 
03:20:48.630 --> 03:20:48.640 align:start position:0%
committee went out on frequent occasions
 
03:20:52.070 --> 03:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
to observe the process and notice that
 
03:20:54.870 --> 03:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
the craftsmen were very very
 
03:20:56.389 --> 03:20:56.399 align:start position:0%
focused on
 
03:20:58.550 --> 03:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
doing things and they said we wonder
 
03:21:01.110 --> 03:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
whether this citizens of dover have any
 
03:21:02.630 --> 03:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
idea what kind of a
 
03:21:04.389 --> 03:21:04.399 align:start position:0%
very high quality building they're
 
03:21:06.710 --> 03:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
getting they were very proud of the work
 
03:21:08.790 --> 03:21:08.800 align:start position:0%
that they were doing which i was
 
03:21:11.349 --> 03:21:11.359 align:start position:0%
gratified to see because also the
 
03:21:14.550 --> 03:21:14.560 align:start position:0%
engineer the architect i should say who
 
03:21:17.110 --> 03:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
was uh responsible for the design
 
03:21:19.110 --> 03:21:19.120 align:start position:0%

03:21:20.790 --> 03:21:20.800 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm sorry is there a que is there a
 
03:21:22.389 --> 03:21:22.399 align:start position:0%
question for the right oh there's always
 
03:21:24.389 --> 03:21:24.399 align:start position:0%
a question at the end of my dialogue
 
03:21:26.630 --> 03:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
let's get to the questions um so the
 
03:21:27.830 --> 03:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
question is
 
03:21:31.590 --> 03:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
do you feel that that the the citizens
 
03:21:34.309 --> 03:21:34.319 align:start position:0%
are sufficiently protected
 
03:21:36.550 --> 03:21:36.560 align:start position:0%
even before this bill
 
03:21:39.590 --> 03:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
with regard to getting the getting what
 
03:21:41.670 --> 03:21:41.680 align:start position:0%
they're paying for i don't believe that
 
03:21:43.510 --> 03:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
this bill would change the current
 
03:21:46.389 --> 03:21:46.399 align:start position:0%
situation in any way whatsoever
 
03:21:46.399 --> 03:21:47.190 align:start position:0%
situation in any way whatsoever
the

03:21:47.190 --> 03:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:21:49.750 --> 03:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
matter of building inspectors and
 
03:21:52.469 --> 03:21:52.479 align:start position:0%
supervision of contracts is something
 
03:21:55.510 --> 03:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
that every person or organization that
 
03:21:57.590 --> 03:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
puts makes a building
 
03:21:59.429 --> 03:21:59.439 align:start position:0%
is responsible for
 
03:22:01.830 --> 03:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
that's in your case the city of dover
 
03:22:03.990 --> 03:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
and in my case my
 
03:22:06.389 --> 03:22:06.399 align:start position:0%
dan and i built a house we did some
 
03:22:09.750 --> 03:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
supervision we hired other people to
 
03:22:11.990 --> 03:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
to do inspections
 
03:22:14.389 --> 03:22:14.399 align:start position:0%
because we can't you know
 
03:22:17.670 --> 03:22:17.680 align:start position:0%
but if you want it if you want to uh
 
03:22:19.830 --> 03:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
this doesn't affect that if you want to
 
03:22:22.870 --> 03:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
talk about requiring building inspectors
 
03:22:25.429 --> 03:22:25.439 align:start position:0%
in other towns or whatever
 
03:22:25.439 --> 03:22:26.630 align:start position:0%
in other towns or whatever
that's

03:22:26.630 --> 03:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
that's
 
03:22:27.910 --> 03:22:27.920 align:start position:0%
an entirely separate piece of
 
03:22:29.910 --> 03:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
legislation i think that's important for
 
03:22:31.349 --> 03:22:31.359 align:start position:0%
the committee to know thank you madam
 
03:22:31.359 --> 03:22:32.150 align:start position:0%
the committee to know thank you madam
chair

03:22:32.150 --> 03:22:32.160 align:start position:0%
chair
 
03:22:35.110 --> 03:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
and thank you madam chair representative
 
03:22:35.120 --> 03:22:36.469 align:start position:0%
and thank you madam chair representative
lekis

03:22:36.469 --> 03:22:36.479 align:start position:0%
lekis
 
03:22:38.550 --> 03:22:38.560 align:start position:0%
thank you um i think from reading the
 
03:22:40.870 --> 03:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
legislation and the previous answer i i
 
03:22:42.469 --> 03:22:42.479 align:start position:0%
think i i know the answer to this but
 
03:22:44.469 --> 03:22:44.479 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure and that is
 
03:22:47.110 --> 03:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
if there are existing uh building codes
 
03:22:49.910 --> 03:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
created by towns
 
03:22:51.990 --> 03:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
and they never bothered to send them to
 
03:22:52.000 --> 03:22:52.870 align:start position:0%
and they never bothered to send them to
the

03:22:52.870 --> 03:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:22:52.880 --> 03:22:53.670 align:start position:0%
the
state

03:22:53.670 --> 03:22:53.680 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:22:55.670 --> 03:22:55.680 align:start position:0%
would this have any impact on them at
 
03:22:58.070 --> 03:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
all unless they went to i guess update
 
03:23:00.150 --> 03:23:00.160 align:start position:0%
them or something
 
03:23:05.229 --> 03:23:05.239 align:start position:0%
uh no it doesn't it doesn't seem to be
 
03:23:05.239 --> 03:23:06.950 align:start position:0%
uh no it doesn't it doesn't seem to be
retrospective

03:23:06.950 --> 03:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
retrospective
 
03:23:06.960 --> 03:23:08.229 align:start position:0%
retrospective
however

03:23:08.229 --> 03:23:08.239 align:start position:0%
however
 
03:23:10.630 --> 03:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
the fact that we now be looking at
 
03:23:14.070 --> 03:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
future and updated building codes might
 
03:23:15.429 --> 03:23:15.439 align:start position:0%
imply might
 
03:23:19.429 --> 03:23:19.439 align:start position:0%
inspire more towns to send any previous
 
03:23:22.309 --> 03:23:22.319 align:start position:0%
amendments just for information purposes
 
03:23:23.830 --> 03:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:23:25.910 --> 03:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
we didn't want to impose
 
03:23:30.710 --> 03:23:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:34.229 --> 03:23:34.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:37.030 --> 03:23:37.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman
 
03:23:50.950 --> 03:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:53.110 --> 03:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman and for the
 
03:23:56.070 --> 03:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
record committee my name is gary abbott
 
03:23:58.309 --> 03:23:58.319 align:start position:0%
i'm the executive vice president of the
 
03:24:00.550 --> 03:24:00.560 align:start position:0%
associated general contractors of new
 
03:24:00.560 --> 03:24:01.750 align:start position:0%
associated general contractors of new
hampshire

03:24:01.750 --> 03:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
03:24:04.070 --> 03:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
and we're here today in full support of
 
03:24:06.630 --> 03:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
senate bill 443
 
03:24:08.630 --> 03:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
i first want to recognize the great
 
03:24:11.110 --> 03:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
effort that senator carson
 
03:24:13.190 --> 03:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire
 
03:24:14.710 --> 03:24:14.720 align:start position:0%
the building code review chairman
 
03:24:17.190 --> 03:24:17.200 align:start position:0%
sherman and their efforts over the last
 
03:24:19.990 --> 03:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
year i mean as you heard before
 
03:24:22.150 --> 03:24:22.160 align:start position:0%
there are really three bills and they
 
03:24:22.160 --> 03:24:23.429 align:start position:0%
there are really three bills and they
intersect

03:24:23.429 --> 03:24:23.439 align:start position:0%
intersect
 
03:24:25.269 --> 03:24:25.279 align:start position:0%
this is the last one that this committee
 
03:24:28.710 --> 03:24:28.720 align:start position:0%
is going to hurt here i guess so
 
03:24:30.630 --> 03:24:30.640 align:start position:0%
i i will stick to that but i think the
 
03:24:32.950 --> 03:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
other bills matter in your recent
 
03:24:32.960 --> 03:24:35.030 align:start position:0%
other bills matter in your recent
questioning

03:24:35.030 --> 03:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
questioning
 
03:24:37.110 --> 03:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
from a contractor perspective we're
 
03:24:39.269 --> 03:24:39.279 align:start position:0%
fully in support because
 
03:24:41.990 --> 03:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
if towns file their amendments
 
03:24:44.550 --> 03:24:44.560 align:start position:0%
it'll be in one location for everyone to
 
03:24:46.229 --> 03:24:46.239 align:start position:0%
see online
 
03:24:48.150 --> 03:24:48.160 align:start position:0%
and that's a great benefit whether it's
 
03:24:49.830 --> 03:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
the city or town
 
03:24:53.110 --> 03:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
the construction architects
 
03:24:54.710 --> 03:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
just to have it centralized because
 
03:24:57.590 --> 03:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
currently a contractor that does work in
 
03:24:59.349 --> 03:24:59.359 align:start position:0%
different communities has to check with
 
03:25:01.349 --> 03:25:01.359 align:start position:0%
that community for any amendments to the
 
03:25:01.359 --> 03:25:02.309 align:start position:0%
that community for any amendments to the
code

03:25:02.309 --> 03:25:02.319 align:start position:0%
code
 
03:25:05.030 --> 03:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
so the thought is is in the future those
 
03:25:07.030 --> 03:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
amendments would all be in one place in
 
03:25:09.190 --> 03:25:09.200 align:start position:0%
a great resource
 
03:25:13.269 --> 03:25:13.279 align:start position:0%
even beyond the check whether it's uh
 
03:25:15.910 --> 03:25:15.920 align:start position:0%
either more stringent or less stringent
 
03:25:17.830 --> 03:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
this will be a great item
 
03:25:19.670 --> 03:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
i also want to address the
 
03:25:22.229 --> 03:25:22.239 align:start position:0%
the your discussion regarding old
 
03:25:22.239 --> 03:25:23.670 align:start position:0%
the your discussion regarding old
amendments

03:25:23.670 --> 03:25:23.680 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
03:25:27.269 --> 03:25:27.279 align:start position:0%
understand uh house bill 1681 is
 
03:25:29.190 --> 03:25:29.200 align:start position:0%
updating the code
 
03:25:31.110 --> 03:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
that's happening this year we're going
 
03:25:34.229 --> 03:25:34.239 align:start position:0%
from 2015 to 2018.
 
03:25:36.229 --> 03:25:36.239 align:start position:0%
some of those amendments are going to be
 
03:25:38.870 --> 03:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
null and void because the new code's
 
03:25:40.790 --> 03:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
going to have incorporated either a more
 
03:25:43.429 --> 03:25:43.439 align:start position:0%
stringent or a higher standard so
 
03:25:46.150 --> 03:25:46.160 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a continual practice
 
03:25:48.229 --> 03:25:48.239 align:start position:0%
if a town wants to
 
03:25:50.950 --> 03:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
update an amendment to which code
 
03:25:53.510 --> 03:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
so as we go through this cycle
 
03:25:55.910 --> 03:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
of getting closer because we did get
 
03:25:55.920 --> 03:25:57.110 align:start position:0%
of getting closer because we did get
behind

03:25:57.110 --> 03:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
behind
 
03:25:59.269 --> 03:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
as the cycle codes i think there'll be
 
03:26:02.150 --> 03:26:02.160 align:start position:0%
less amendments by municipalities
 
03:26:03.910 --> 03:26:03.920 align:start position:0%
because of the reasons you've already
 
03:26:03.920 --> 03:26:04.790 align:start position:0%
because of the reasons you've already
heard

03:26:04.790 --> 03:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
heard
 
03:26:06.630 --> 03:26:06.640 align:start position:0%
the expertise is really with the
 
03:26:08.630 --> 03:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
building code review board and all of
 
03:26:10.229 --> 03:26:10.239 align:start position:0%
those specialties
 
03:26:12.950 --> 03:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
that's where they that's and they are
 
03:26:15.190 --> 03:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
the ones reviewing the next code
 
03:26:17.590 --> 03:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
so i'm looking at it they'll be less and
 
03:26:19.990 --> 03:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
less need for the towns to update their
 
03:26:22.389 --> 03:26:22.399 align:start position:0%
code feeling that they're behind since
 
03:26:24.710 --> 03:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
we'll be caught up so i think yeah i'm
 
03:26:26.870 --> 03:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
looking at is in the totality
 
03:26:28.229 --> 03:26:28.239 align:start position:0%
of what's happening within the
 
03:26:31.110 --> 03:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
legislature with all three of the bills
 
03:26:33.190 --> 03:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
this is one piece that i don't think you
 
03:26:35.110 --> 03:26:35.120 align:start position:0%
have to go back and look because i think
 
03:26:37.510 --> 03:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
it's going to automatically happen
 
03:26:38.950 --> 03:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
the amendments are going to be to an
 
03:26:41.910 --> 03:26:41.920 align:start position:0%
older code not to the newer code so i
 
03:26:43.990 --> 03:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
think this thing is going to end up
 
03:26:46.070 --> 03:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
being much better for towns because they
 
03:26:47.429 --> 03:26:47.439 align:start position:0%
i think there will be
 
03:26:49.510 --> 03:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
less instances in which they feel the
 
03:26:51.590 --> 03:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
need to go more stringent because the
 
03:26:54.389 --> 03:26:54.399 align:start position:0%
code will be more current and so
 
03:26:56.550 --> 03:26:56.560 align:start position:0%
i would hope this committee
 
03:26:58.389 --> 03:26:58.399 align:start position:0%
you have to understand
 
03:27:00.309 --> 03:27:00.319 align:start position:0%
anytime you have a bill that the home
 
03:27:00.319 --> 03:27:01.349 align:start position:0%
anytime you have a bill that the home
builders

03:27:01.349 --> 03:27:01.359 align:start position:0%
builders
 
03:27:03.670 --> 03:27:03.680 align:start position:0%
i represent commercial construction most
 
03:27:05.030 --> 03:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
of our projects are designed by
 
03:27:05.040 --> 03:27:06.469 align:start position:0%
of our projects are designed by
architects

03:27:06.469 --> 03:27:06.479 align:start position:0%
architects
 
03:27:08.630 --> 03:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
but when you look at all the groups that
 
03:27:10.790 --> 03:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
are involved in this the building code
 
03:27:10.800 --> 03:27:12.229 align:start position:0%
are involved in this the building code
officials

03:27:12.229 --> 03:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
officials
 
03:27:14.070 --> 03:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
all of them that have come together and
 
03:27:15.990 --> 03:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
i'll support this i think i would hope
 
03:27:17.590 --> 03:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
that the committee would support the
 
03:27:21.190 --> 03:27:21.200 align:start position:0%
senate bill 443
 
03:27:23.670 --> 03:27:23.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative lucas thank you
 
03:27:27.190 --> 03:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
uh again back to i guess existing um
 
03:27:29.910 --> 03:27:29.920 align:start position:0%
town amendments the building code
 
03:27:32.469 --> 03:27:32.479 align:start position:0%
and i understand you know we adopt a new
 
03:27:35.030 --> 03:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
building code and their amendments you
 
03:27:37.590 --> 03:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
know their building code updates may be
 
03:27:37.600 --> 03:27:38.790 align:start position:0%
know their building code updates may be
obsolete

03:27:38.790 --> 03:27:38.800 align:start position:0%
obsolete
 
03:27:41.670 --> 03:27:41.680 align:start position:0%
my question is is there any process of
 
03:27:43.510 --> 03:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
cleaning those out other than an
 
03:27:47.269 --> 03:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
architect or a contractor discovers in
 
03:27:49.990 --> 03:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
trying to do some work that there are
 
03:27:52.870 --> 03:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
stale or obsolete or incompatible
 
03:27:54.950 --> 03:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
local town ordinances and somehow you
 
03:27:56.710 --> 03:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
know brings that to someone's attention
 
03:27:58.469 --> 03:27:58.479 align:start position:0%
or is that stuff basically to sit there
 
03:28:02.070 --> 03:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
until somebody runs into it as a problem
 
03:28:04.550 --> 03:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
my my hope is is that this is the first
 
03:28:07.110 --> 03:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
step to get that process in
 
03:28:09.190 --> 03:28:09.200 align:start position:0%
i agree with you we may have some of
 
03:28:11.030 --> 03:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
those but i think the building code
 
03:28:13.429 --> 03:28:13.439 align:start position:0%
review board and working with cities and
 
03:28:15.269 --> 03:28:15.279 align:start position:0%
towns maybe the municipal association
 
03:28:17.830 --> 03:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
others we we could clean that up so
 
03:28:19.349 --> 03:28:19.359 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely right an architect's
 
03:28:21.110 --> 03:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
going to hit that or a building contract
 
03:28:23.349 --> 03:28:23.359 align:start position:0%
is going to see that it's not necessary
 
03:28:24.790 --> 03:28:24.800 align:start position:0%
and hopefully towns will go through the
 
03:28:27.349 --> 03:28:27.359 align:start position:0%
process of removing those amendments if
 
03:28:29.349 --> 03:28:29.359 align:start position:0%
they're not shouldn't be in place or
 
03:28:31.110 --> 03:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
updating them but i think we're going to
 
03:28:33.429 --> 03:28:33.439 align:start position:0%
go through a period of time i
 
03:28:35.269 --> 03:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
i think it would over complicate the
 
03:28:37.190 --> 03:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
bill to try to have the building code
 
03:28:39.349 --> 03:28:39.359 align:start position:0%
review board look at all past amendments
 
03:28:41.429 --> 03:28:41.439 align:start position:0%
all at once i think that could be
 
03:28:43.830 --> 03:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
problematic moving forward okay thank
 
03:28:45.590 --> 03:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
you i agree i just uh
 
03:28:47.190 --> 03:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
was was concerned for the people having
 
03:28:48.790 --> 03:28:48.800 align:start position:0%
to deal with these codes about having
 
03:28:50.309 --> 03:28:50.319 align:start position:0%
potentially conflicting things they're
 
03:28:52.630 --> 03:28:52.640 align:start position:0%
supposed to yeah it would be great if
 
03:28:54.229 --> 03:28:54.239 align:start position:0%
this bill goes through and then cities
 
03:28:56.229 --> 03:28:56.239 align:start position:0%
and towns go through this process i
 
03:28:57.830 --> 03:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
think they'll probably look at all of
 
03:28:59.670 --> 03:28:59.680 align:start position:0%
their amendments and hope that would be
 
03:29:02.870 --> 03:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
what they would do hope so thank you
 
03:29:05.030 --> 03:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt
 
03:29:07.030 --> 03:29:07.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:29:09.190 --> 03:29:09.200 align:start position:0%
so mr abbott you know you and i have
 
03:29:11.910 --> 03:29:11.920 align:start position:0%
gone around and around for many years
 
03:29:13.030 --> 03:29:13.040 align:start position:0%
since uh
 
03:29:17.030 --> 03:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
i got on this committee 16 years ago um
 
03:29:19.830 --> 03:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
uh and i'm wondering i mean this is the
 
03:29:22.790 --> 03:29:22.800 align:start position:0%
live free or die state and and obviously
 
03:29:24.070 --> 03:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
when you have a
 
03:29:24.080 --> 03:29:25.750 align:start position:0%
when you have a
uh

03:29:25.750 --> 03:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:29:25.760 --> 03:29:26.469 align:start position:0%
uh
a

03:29:26.469 --> 03:29:26.479 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:29:30.150 --> 03:29:30.160 align:start position:0%
couple that buys a a contractor services
 
03:29:32.790 --> 03:29:32.800 align:start position:0%
to build a home if it's a couple like
 
03:29:37.110 --> 03:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
the mcguires who um
 
03:29:37.120 --> 03:29:38.070 align:start position:0%
the mcguires who um
the

03:29:38.070 --> 03:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:29:39.670 --> 03:29:39.680 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire and former
 
03:29:42.469 --> 03:29:42.479 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire are both very
 
03:29:45.990 --> 03:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
smart people and she's an engineer
 
03:29:48.229 --> 03:29:48.239 align:start position:0%
so i think you're going to get a more
 
03:29:50.309 --> 03:29:50.319 align:start position:0%
buyer beware couple
 
03:29:50.319 --> 03:29:51.429 align:start position:0%
buyer beware couple
uh

03:29:51.429 --> 03:29:51.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:29:55.190 --> 03:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
than you did with in many cases so
 
03:29:58.870 --> 03:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
but what i'm concerned about is are we
 
03:30:01.349 --> 03:30:01.359 align:start position:0%
is our situation in new hampshire
 
03:30:03.670 --> 03:30:03.680 align:start position:0%
way too loosey-goosey with regard to
 
03:30:07.269 --> 03:30:07.279 align:start position:0%
adherence to codes and so forth in areas
 
03:30:10.469 --> 03:30:10.479 align:start position:0%
where the inspection capabilities are
 
03:30:10.479 --> 03:30:11.429 align:start position:0%
where the inspection capabilities are
much

03:30:11.429 --> 03:30:11.439 align:start position:0%
much
 
03:30:11.439 --> 03:30:12.710 align:start position:0%
much
much

03:30:12.710 --> 03:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
much
 
03:30:14.830 --> 03:30:14.840 align:start position:0%
more rudimentary than they are in the
 
03:30:17.190 --> 03:30:17.200 align:start position:0%
cities i i don't think so representing
 
03:30:20.389 --> 03:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
contractors for some 35 years
 
03:30:21.990 --> 03:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
it's clear that the construction
 
03:30:24.070 --> 03:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
industry wants to build to the latest
 
03:30:26.870 --> 03:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
code or a higher code
 
03:30:29.590 --> 03:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
we can't build to a lesser code because
 
03:30:31.910 --> 03:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
of the liability issues
 
03:30:34.309 --> 03:30:34.319 align:start position:0%
everyone involved in a process project
 
03:30:35.670 --> 03:30:35.680 align:start position:0%
and i think you would hear a lot of
 
03:30:37.750 --> 03:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
newspaper stories if things were being
 
03:30:39.830 --> 03:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
shoddy done especially in the commercial
 
03:30:39.840 --> 03:30:41.110 align:start position:0%
shoddy done especially in the commercial
end

03:30:41.110 --> 03:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
end
 
03:30:43.110 --> 03:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
i don't think you get that
 
03:30:45.510 --> 03:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
and i don't think this bill in any way
 
03:30:48.550 --> 03:30:48.560 align:start position:0%
affects the current inspection process
 
03:30:50.389 --> 03:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
third-party inspections a lot of people
 
03:30:53.110 --> 03:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
don't realize there's a lot of processes
 
03:30:54.710 --> 03:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
when you're doing uh
 
03:30:57.190 --> 03:30:57.200 align:start position:0%
especially in our case large commercial
 
03:30:59.110 --> 03:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
projects there's a number of things that
 
03:31:00.790 --> 03:31:00.800 align:start position:0%
are done for the owner's purpose of
 
03:31:02.389 --> 03:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
testing things
 
03:31:05.349 --> 03:31:05.359 align:start position:0%
so that's not been an issue for us
 
03:31:08.550 --> 03:31:08.560 align:start position:0%
and we really look towards the architect
 
03:31:10.630 --> 03:31:10.640 align:start position:0%
to design based on the code that's in
 
03:31:13.590 --> 03:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
place and i think these three bills
 
03:31:15.910 --> 03:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
really are a complement to
 
03:31:17.670 --> 03:31:17.680 align:start position:0%
straightening out some of the loose ends
 
03:31:19.750 --> 03:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
that we've had in years past but i don't
 
03:31:21.910 --> 03:31:21.920 align:start position:0%
i don't think it has any effect
 
03:31:25.510 --> 03:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
on the inspection process or
 
03:31:27.269 --> 03:31:27.279 align:start position:0%
all of those the building code officials
 
03:31:28.710 --> 03:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
but it's great to have the building code
 
03:31:31.429 --> 03:31:31.439 align:start position:0%
officials that support this as well
 
03:31:31.439 --> 03:31:32.870 align:start position:0%
officials that support this as well
well

03:31:32.870 --> 03:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:31:35.510 --> 03:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
i'm very glad to hear uh your remarks
 
03:31:35.520 --> 03:31:36.550 align:start position:0%
i'm very glad to hear uh your remarks
because

03:31:36.550 --> 03:31:36.560 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:31:36.560 --> 03:31:37.429 align:start position:0%
because
uh

03:31:37.429 --> 03:31:37.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:31:39.510 --> 03:31:39.520 align:start position:0%
that's very heartening for me as a
 
03:31:42.389 --> 03:31:42.399 align:start position:0%
non-engineer to know that that the
 
03:31:42.399 --> 03:31:44.550 align:start position:0%
non-engineer to know that that the
industry

03:31:44.550 --> 03:31:44.560 align:start position:0%
industry
 
03:31:46.710 --> 03:31:46.720 align:start position:0%
really does care and that is trying to
 
03:31:50.550 --> 03:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
do things right and improve things
 
03:31:52.469 --> 03:31:52.479 align:start position:0%
perhaps you recall a couple of years ago
 
03:31:55.670 --> 03:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
we had a discussion in this committee
 
03:31:57.910 --> 03:31:57.920 align:start position:0%
that was facilitated by the fact that we
 
03:31:57.920 --> 03:31:58.870 align:start position:0%
that was facilitated by the fact that we
have

03:31:58.870 --> 03:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:31:58.880 --> 03:32:00.550 align:start position:0%
have
two

03:32:00.550 --> 03:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
two
 
03:32:03.510 --> 03:32:03.520 align:start position:0%
former firefighters to my right and
 
03:32:05.030 --> 03:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
several other firefighters on the
 
03:32:08.229 --> 03:32:08.239 align:start position:0%
committee or had them in the past
 
03:32:10.550 --> 03:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
and there was a colloquy about whether
 
03:32:10.560 --> 03:32:11.349 align:start position:0%
and there was a colloquy about whether
the

03:32:11.349 --> 03:32:11.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:32:13.349 --> 03:32:13.359 align:start position:0%
construction of the
 
03:32:15.269 --> 03:32:15.279 align:start position:0%
uh the basement
 
03:32:15.279 --> 03:32:15.990 align:start position:0%
uh the basement
uh

03:32:15.990 --> 03:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:32:17.990 --> 03:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
basically the
 
03:32:21.110 --> 03:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
the ceiling of the basement right
 
03:32:22.550 --> 03:32:22.560 align:start position:0%
there was some kind of
 
03:32:25.030 --> 03:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
more modern or
 
03:32:27.030 --> 03:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt is this a
 
03:32:28.630 --> 03:32:28.640 align:start position:0%
question or can you keep this for the
 
03:32:31.030 --> 03:32:31.040 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
03:32:33.269 --> 03:32:33.279 align:start position:0%
is it a question is there a question or
 
03:32:35.190 --> 03:32:35.200 align:start position:0%
can you keep what you're discussing for
 
03:32:38.070 --> 03:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
the executive session
 
03:32:39.670 --> 03:32:39.680 align:start position:0%
i think it's a there's a question
 
03:32:39.680 --> 03:32:41.030 align:start position:0%
i think it's a there's a question
because

03:32:41.030 --> 03:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:32:43.349 --> 03:32:43.359 align:start position:0%
there was a real discussion whether the
 
03:32:45.990 --> 03:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
whether that newfangled concept was
 
03:32:48.630 --> 03:32:48.640 align:start position:0%
going to burn through too fast to
 
03:32:51.910 --> 03:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
protect the thing and my request my
 
03:32:54.070 --> 03:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
recollection is that the
 
03:32:54.080 --> 03:32:55.269 align:start position:0%
recollection is that the
um

03:32:55.269 --> 03:32:55.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:58.229 --> 03:32:58.239 align:start position:0%
that the committee wisely turned down
 
03:32:58.239 --> 03:32:59.030 align:start position:0%
that the committee wisely turned down
at

03:32:59.030 --> 03:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
at
 
03:33:00.550 --> 03:33:00.560 align:start position:0%
the uh you know
 
03:33:03.110 --> 03:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
the insistence of the firefighters that
 
03:33:05.190 --> 03:33:05.200 align:start position:0%
that was not in their opinion something
 
03:33:07.750 --> 03:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
was safe you recall that colloquy i do
 
03:33:10.070 --> 03:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
recall that that really had to do with
 
03:33:12.790 --> 03:33:12.800 align:start position:0%
uh residential construction but it is
 
03:33:15.429 --> 03:33:15.439 align:start position:0%
part of the process of amendments that
 
03:33:17.269 --> 03:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
happened with the building code review
 
03:33:19.429 --> 03:33:19.439 align:start position:0%
board so i think we're not affecting
 
03:33:21.830 --> 03:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
that process that clearly was
 
03:33:23.510 --> 03:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
an item that was
 
03:33:25.510 --> 03:33:25.520 align:start position:0%
in negotiations between the parties that
 
03:33:27.429 --> 03:33:27.439 align:start position:0%
you talked about but i think that was
 
03:33:29.110 --> 03:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
completely resolved you're going to hit
 
03:33:31.349 --> 03:33:31.359 align:start position:0%
those over the years whenever you have a
 
03:33:33.349 --> 03:33:33.359 align:start position:0%
new code whether it's through the fire
 
03:33:34.870 --> 03:33:34.880 align:start position:0%
code or whether it's the billing code
 
03:33:37.429 --> 03:33:37.439 align:start position:0%
but i don't think it pertains to
 
03:33:40.150 --> 03:33:40.160 align:start position:0%
this 443 in the sense that
 
03:33:42.150 --> 03:33:42.160 align:start position:0%
this is really about filing amendments
 
03:33:44.229 --> 03:33:44.239 align:start position:0%
from the local level
 
03:33:44.239 --> 03:33:45.110 align:start position:0%
from the local level
good

03:33:45.110 --> 03:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
good
 
03:33:47.510 --> 03:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
03:33:47.520 --> 03:33:48.950 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
fellows

03:33:48.950 --> 03:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
fellows
 
03:33:50.469 --> 03:33:50.479 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:33:53.349 --> 03:33:53.359 align:start position:0%
um my question is i'm just concerned
 
03:33:55.429 --> 03:33:55.439 align:start position:0%
about the
 
03:33:57.910 --> 03:33:57.920 align:start position:0%
administrative process and how long
 
03:33:59.750 --> 03:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
that's going to take and how long it's
 
03:34:02.309 --> 03:34:02.319 align:start position:0%
going complicated it's going to be
 
03:34:05.510 --> 03:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
after a town a small town
 
03:34:07.670 --> 03:34:07.680 align:start position:0%
makes a change
 
03:34:07.680 --> 03:34:08.630 align:start position:0%
makes a change
they

03:34:08.630 --> 03:34:08.640 align:start position:0%
they
 
03:34:10.710 --> 03:34:10.720 align:start position:0%
they vote on an amendment to the
 
03:34:11.990 --> 03:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
building code
 
03:34:15.030 --> 03:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
and it just seems very complicated to me
 
03:34:17.510 --> 03:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
that first they have to send it
 
03:34:19.030 --> 03:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
to the board
 
03:34:21.510 --> 03:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
and the board has to look at it and
 
03:34:22.870 --> 03:34:22.880 align:start position:0%
approve it
 
03:34:25.110 --> 03:34:25.120 align:start position:0%
and then there's an administrative
 
03:34:26.950 --> 03:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
person involved because you're going to
 
03:34:29.590 --> 03:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
have to hire a new staff and then it's
 
03:34:32.389 --> 03:34:32.399 align:start position:0%
going to have to be put on on the web
 
03:34:32.399 --> 03:34:34.150 align:start position:0%
going to have to be put on on the web
and

03:34:34.150 --> 03:34:34.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:34:36.550 --> 03:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
it just seems like a lot of
 
03:34:36.560 --> 03:34:37.830 align:start position:0%
it just seems like a lot of
paperwork

03:34:37.830 --> 03:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
paperwork
 
03:34:41.349 --> 03:34:41.359 align:start position:0%
kind of stuff in and that
 
03:34:43.750 --> 03:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
i don't is the board going to approve
 
03:34:45.910 --> 03:34:45.920 align:start position:0%
everything it sees within
 
03:34:48.309 --> 03:34:48.319 align:start position:0%
a week or two weeks or how often does
 
03:34:50.790 --> 03:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
the board meet in town little towns have
 
03:34:52.469 --> 03:34:52.479 align:start position:0%
their meetings all at the same time in
 
03:34:55.269 --> 03:34:55.279 align:start position:0%
the spring basically
 
03:34:56.950 --> 03:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
i'm going to say that i'm probably not
 
03:34:59.910 --> 03:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
the best one to talk about this but i do
 
03:35:02.229 --> 03:35:02.239 align:start position:0%
know the building code review board jam
 
03:35:03.429 --> 03:35:03.439 align:start position:0%
and chairman
 
03:35:05.190 --> 03:35:05.200 align:start position:0%
went through a lot of these same
 
03:35:06.550 --> 03:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
questions when they went through
 
03:35:09.190 --> 03:35:09.200 align:start position:0%
amending it to get it to this point
 
03:35:11.110 --> 03:35:11.120 align:start position:0%
that a lot of those issues were resolved
 
03:35:13.830 --> 03:35:13.840 align:start position:0%
with how they're not an approval process
 
03:35:15.830 --> 03:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
they're a review process
 
03:35:17.830 --> 03:35:17.840 align:start position:0%
and i don't i think right now i
 
03:35:19.670 --> 03:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
recognize that in the statute it says
 
03:35:21.670 --> 03:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
towns are supposed to send it to the
 
03:35:23.510 --> 03:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
building code review board but some are
 
03:35:23.520 --> 03:35:24.389 align:start position:0%
building code review board but some are
not

03:35:24.389 --> 03:35:24.399 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:35:26.150 --> 03:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
this gives a little more that there's
 
03:35:28.070 --> 03:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
some indication they get at least
 
03:35:29.190 --> 03:35:29.200 align:start position:0%
whether it
 
03:35:31.030 --> 03:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
is good or bad
 
03:35:34.150 --> 03:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
i understand your concern but i think
 
03:35:36.469 --> 03:35:36.479 align:start position:0%
i'm hopeful that with the passage of new
 
03:35:38.469 --> 03:35:38.479 align:start position:0%
codes there will be less filings and it
 
03:35:40.309 --> 03:35:40.319 align:start position:0%
won't be that big a burden in the long
 
03:35:42.550 --> 03:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
run there may be a little influx at the
 
03:35:43.910 --> 03:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
beginning but i don't think it'll be
 
03:35:46.229 --> 03:35:46.239 align:start position:0%
that otherwise i think the building code
 
03:35:47.670 --> 03:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
review board
 
03:35:49.190 --> 03:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
chairman would be here telling you he
 
03:35:54.070 --> 03:35:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:04.830 --> 03:36:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:09.429 --> 03:36:09.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:11.429 --> 03:36:11.439 align:start position:0%
so we work carefully with margaret burns
 
03:36:13.030 --> 03:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
from the new hampshire municipal
 
03:36:15.030 --> 03:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
association on this issue
 
03:36:18.630 --> 03:36:18.640 align:start position:0%
and i only partly understand the forms
 
03:36:20.389 --> 03:36:20.399 align:start position:0%
of town and city government in new
 
03:36:23.349 --> 03:36:23.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire but as i understand it
 
03:36:26.710 --> 03:36:26.720 align:start position:0%
uh cities have a relatively large degree
 
03:36:28.309 --> 03:36:28.319 align:start position:0%
of florida not even interests in the
 
03:36:28.319 --> 03:36:30.229 align:start position:0%
of florida not even interests in the
cities

03:36:30.229 --> 03:36:30.239 align:start position:0%
cities
 
03:36:31.910 --> 03:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
i'm interested in the small towns can
 
03:36:33.590 --> 03:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
you just speak to that
 
03:36:36.550 --> 03:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
okay so there's a very narrow band of
 
03:36:38.469 --> 03:36:38.479 align:start position:0%
small towns that are involved in this
 
03:36:40.790 --> 03:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
process and here's the reason why
 
03:36:44.469 --> 03:36:44.479 align:start position:0%
unless you have adopted this the rsa 674
 
03:36:46.469 --> 03:36:46.479 align:start position:0%
process which involves hiring a building
 
03:36:48.870 --> 03:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
inspector and so forth you can't amend
 
03:36:51.910 --> 03:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
the code so that cuts off most of the
 
03:36:54.150 --> 03:36:54.160 align:start position:0%
small small towns they have nothing to
 
03:36:55.830 --> 03:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
do with this process because they
 
03:36:58.309 --> 03:36:58.319 align:start position:0%
legally can't amend the code anyway so
 
03:37:01.190 --> 03:37:01.200 align:start position:0%
there's a fairly narrow band of towns
 
03:37:03.349 --> 03:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
that are large enough to have a building
 
03:37:03.359 --> 03:37:04.469 align:start position:0%
that are large enough to have a building
inspector

03:37:04.469 --> 03:37:04.479 align:start position:0%
inspector
 
03:37:06.469 --> 03:37:06.479 align:start position:0%
small enough where these things have to
 
03:37:08.870 --> 03:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
go through the town meeting cycle
 
03:37:11.269 --> 03:37:11.279 align:start position:0%
so the effort was to provide a time
 
03:37:14.150 --> 03:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
frame that aligned according to margaret
 
03:37:16.389 --> 03:37:16.399 align:start position:0%
burns with the town meeting cycle which
 
03:37:18.790 --> 03:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
is the tight one when things have to be
 
03:37:21.349 --> 03:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
posted and public hearings and so forth
 
03:37:23.590 --> 03:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
while still giving the cities who have
 
03:37:25.590 --> 03:37:25.600 align:start position:0%
much more latitude time wise because
 
03:37:26.870 --> 03:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
they're dealing with city council or
 
03:37:26.880 --> 03:37:27.830 align:start position:0%
they're dealing with city council or
whatever

03:37:27.830 --> 03:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
03:37:30.070 --> 03:37:30.080 align:start position:0%
and don't have those pressures of time
 
03:37:32.630 --> 03:37:32.640 align:start position:0%
quite so much that's why the
 
03:37:38.630 --> 03:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:41.349 --> 03:37:41.359 align:start position:0%
so my question had to do with when they
 
03:37:42.830 --> 03:37:42.840 align:start position:0%
send you a
 
03:37:46.550 --> 03:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
change how long in this process seems to
 
03:37:47.670 --> 03:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
be that the
 
03:37:50.070 --> 03:37:50.080 align:start position:0%
the board has to review them and then it
 
03:37:53.110 --> 03:37:53.120 align:start position:0%
gets passed to an administrative person
 
03:37:54.950 --> 03:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
how long is that gonna take are you
 
03:37:54.960 --> 03:37:57.990 align:start position:0%
how long is that gonna take are you
gonna

03:37:57.990 --> 03:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:59.990 --> 03:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
we're comfortable at this point that we
 
03:38:02.469 --> 03:38:02.479 align:start position:0%
can meet the timing in this proposed
 
03:38:02.479 --> 03:38:03.990 align:start position:0%
can meet the timing in this proposed
bill

03:38:03.990 --> 03:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:38:07.030 --> 03:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
understand that many of these are
 
03:38:07.040 --> 03:38:08.309 align:start position:0%
understand that many of these are
repetitive

03:38:08.309 --> 03:38:08.319 align:start position:0%
repetitive
 
03:38:10.389 --> 03:38:10.399 align:start position:0%
there are several jurisdictions that
 
03:38:12.790 --> 03:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
want to require a manual pull station
 
03:38:15.030 --> 03:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
fire alarm pull station where the model
 
03:38:16.469 --> 03:38:16.479 align:start position:0%
codes don't
 
03:38:18.870 --> 03:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
it may be that through our rules as we
 
03:38:21.349 --> 03:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
go through the process of updating that
 
03:38:23.750 --> 03:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
that becomes almost a matter of form
 
03:38:26.070 --> 03:38:26.080 align:start position:0%
approval so it may not have to go to the
 
03:38:27.910 --> 03:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
whole board because they may approve it
 
03:38:29.189 --> 03:38:29.199 align:start position:0%
as a as a
 
03:38:31.110 --> 03:38:31.120 align:start position:0%
standard approval if you will of some
 
03:38:33.510 --> 03:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
sort uh but there's a fair amount of
 
03:38:35.269 --> 03:38:35.279 align:start position:0%
repetition to that
 
03:38:35.279 --> 03:38:36.630 align:start position:0%
repetition to that
um

03:38:36.630 --> 03:38:36.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:39.030 --> 03:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
many of the problems we've found have
 
03:38:41.990 --> 03:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
have had to do with officials creating
 
03:38:43.429 --> 03:38:43.439 align:start position:0%
rules without going through the
 
03:38:45.349 --> 03:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
ordinance process at all
 
03:38:45.359 --> 03:38:46.389 align:start position:0%
ordinance process at all
or

03:38:46.389 --> 03:38:46.399 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:38:48.630 --> 03:38:48.640 align:start position:0%
properly approved ordinances that get
 
03:38:50.630 --> 03:38:50.640 align:start position:0%
stale and get out of date
 
03:38:52.469 --> 03:38:52.479 align:start position:0%
so that's going to be a i think
 
03:38:54.389 --> 03:38:54.399 align:start position:0%
something as gary said
 
03:38:56.950 --> 03:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
is going to get updated over time to a
 
03:38:56.960 --> 03:38:58.229 align:start position:0%
is going to get updated over time to a
degree

03:38:58.229 --> 03:38:58.239 align:start position:0%
degree
 
03:38:58.239 --> 03:38:59.030 align:start position:0%
degree
um

03:38:59.030 --> 03:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:00.550 --> 03:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
but i think we're we're going to be able
 
03:39:03.110 --> 03:39:03.120 align:start position:0%
to keep up with these time frames
 
03:39:03.120 --> 03:39:03.910 align:start position:0%
to keep up with these time frames
and

03:39:03.910 --> 03:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:39:05.750 --> 03:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
there's language in the bill here to
 
03:39:08.070 --> 03:39:08.080 align:start position:0%
protect the towns in that if we don't
 
03:39:10.389 --> 03:39:10.399 align:start position:0%
keep up with our end of the bargain the
 
03:39:12.550 --> 03:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
default is that they are treated as
 
03:39:12.560 --> 03:39:14.469 align:start position:0%
default is that they are treated as
confirmed

03:39:14.469 --> 03:39:14.479 align:start position:0%
confirmed
 
03:39:16.229 --> 03:39:16.239 align:start position:0%
some are unhappy with that language but
 
03:39:19.269 --> 03:39:19.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:20.790 --> 03:39:20.800 align:start position:0%
did you have an another follow-up
 
03:39:22.790 --> 03:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
03:39:25.110 --> 03:39:25.120 align:start position:0%
so the things that are going to be stale
 
03:39:27.189 --> 03:39:27.199 align:start position:0%
and out of date how are you going to
 
03:39:31.990 --> 03:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:35.030 --> 03:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
you don't have to dig very hard
 
03:39:36.469 --> 03:39:36.479 align:start position:0%
to find
 
03:39:38.469 --> 03:39:38.479 align:start position:0%
the cities that
 
03:39:40.309 --> 03:39:40.319 align:start position:0%
haven't yet updated
 
03:39:40.319 --> 03:39:41.830 align:start position:0%
haven't yet updated
right

03:39:41.830 --> 03:39:41.840 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:39:46.910 --> 03:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:49.590 --> 03:39:49.600 align:start position:0%
statutorily it's not up to us to find
 
03:39:49.600 --> 03:39:50.630 align:start position:0%
statutorily it's not up to us to find
that

03:39:50.630 --> 03:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:39:53.110 --> 03:39:53.120 align:start position:0%
this bill says they can't enforce it
 
03:39:55.590 --> 03:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
unless they're confirmed
 
03:39:58.070 --> 03:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:00.790 --> 03:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
we're not looking to be the policeman of
 
03:40:02.469 --> 03:40:02.479 align:start position:0%
finding this stuff
 
03:40:05.030 --> 03:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's a feed to us and then back to
 
03:40:07.110 --> 03:40:07.120 align:start position:0%
back to the towns
 
03:40:08.950 --> 03:40:08.960 align:start position:0%
there i think will be a courtesy
 
03:40:12.469 --> 03:40:12.479 align:start position:0%
discussion prior to january for the ones
 
03:40:14.950 --> 03:40:14.960 align:start position:0%
we find but
 
03:40:17.429 --> 03:40:17.439 align:start position:0%
but this this bill does not include the
 
03:40:19.510 --> 03:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
time or the effort to act as the
 
03:40:20.870 --> 03:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
policemen and
 
03:40:24.150 --> 03:40:24.160 align:start position:0%
chase existing problems around
 
03:40:25.990 --> 03:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
representative schuett
 
03:40:27.990 --> 03:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair that sort of goes
 
03:40:29.670 --> 03:40:29.680 align:start position:0%
to the question that was
 
03:40:31.830 --> 03:40:31.840 align:start position:0%
going through my mind i don't see any
 
03:40:32.950 --> 03:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
03:40:35.750 --> 03:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
penalty for a municipality that doesn't
 
03:40:38.389 --> 03:40:38.399 align:start position:0%
comply with this was that considered at
 
03:40:38.399 --> 03:40:40.150 align:start position:0%
comply with this was that considered at
all

03:40:40.150 --> 03:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
all
 
03:40:43.030 --> 03:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
not to my knowledge
 
03:40:43.040 --> 03:40:43.990 align:start position:0%
not to my knowledge
there

03:40:43.990 --> 03:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:40:47.349 --> 03:40:47.359 align:start position:0%
there may be penalties embedded in
 
03:40:51.429 --> 03:40:51.439 align:start position:0%
rsa 674 which is where
 
03:40:54.710 --> 03:40:54.720 align:start position:0%
the reporting requirements resides i i
 
03:40:58.550 --> 03:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:00.870 --> 03:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
03:41:06.469 --> 03:41:06.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:07.990 --> 03:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
i i know i'm not going to be able to
 
03:41:09.750 --> 03:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
pronounce this so i
 
03:41:13.429 --> 03:41:13.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:14.870 --> 03:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
that is not at all what i was going to
 
03:41:14.880 --> 03:41:17.750 align:start position:0%
that is not at all what i was going to
say

03:41:17.750 --> 03:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:20.790 --> 03:41:20.800 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is henry zumas

03:41:35.429 --> 03:41:35.439 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire legislators many years
 
03:41:37.429 --> 03:41:37.439 align:start position:0%
ago have provided the state with a board
 
03:41:39.910 --> 03:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
to oversee all national construction and
 
03:41:41.670 --> 03:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
building and fire codes
 
03:41:43.429 --> 03:41:43.439 align:start position:0%
this board covers the interests of the

contractors and electricians
 
03:41:52.790 --> 03:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
it also is a portal to know the uh what
 
03:41:54.309 --> 03:41:54.319 align:start position:0%
year of code
 
03:41:54.319 --> 03:41:54.950 align:start position:0%
year of code
and

03:41:54.950 --> 03:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:41:56.710 --> 03:41:56.720 align:start position:0%
amendments to those code that the state
 
03:41:59.269 --> 03:41:59.279 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire is following
 
03:42:02.469 --> 03:42:02.479 align:start position:0%

forum to view and comment on
 
03:42:14.150 --> 03:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
this information will also allow

what is required
 
03:42:29.670 --> 03:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
by code in the state of new hampshire
 
03:42:31.429 --> 03:42:31.439 align:start position:0%
our electricians board prides itself
 
03:42:33.189 --> 03:42:33.199 align:start position:0%
with the requirements of all licensed
 
03:42:35.590 --> 03:42:35.600 align:start position:0%
electricians to do a code update course
 
03:42:37.830 --> 03:42:37.840 align:start position:0%
every three years to keep up with
 
03:42:40.150 --> 03:42:40.160 align:start position:0%
changes in our industry and during this
 
03:42:42.710 --> 03:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
time all providers review the amendments
 
03:42:44.229 --> 03:42:44.239 align:start position:0%
of the state the state of new hampshire

03:42:50.630 --> 03:42:50.640 align:start position:0%
this has prepared our electricians for
 
03:42:52.790 --> 03:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
upcoming changes even before new
 
03:42:55.349 --> 03:42:55.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire adopts these codes
 
03:42:58.150 --> 03:42:58.160 align:start position:0%
in closing senate bill 443 will enhance
 
03:43:00.309 --> 03:43:00.319 align:start position:0%

members my name is steven ryancourt i'm
 
03:43:45.269 --> 03:43:45.279 align:start position:0%

03:43:46.550 --> 03:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and i'm also here
 
03:43:48.389 --> 03:43:48.399 align:start position:0%
representing the ecba electrical
 
03:43:50.710 --> 03:43:50.720 align:start position:0%
contractors business association
 
03:43:50.720 --> 03:43:51.910 align:start position:0%
contractors business association
um

03:43:51.910 --> 03:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:43:54.229 --> 03:43:54.239 align:start position:0%
as stated by senator carson this bill is
 
03:43:57.590 --> 03:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
started years ago in our working process
 
03:43:58.950 --> 03:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
we support this bill and hope that
 
03:44:00.710 --> 03:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
you'll move it forward
 
03:44:02.309 --> 03:44:02.319 align:start position:0%
again it's just really trying to focus
 
03:44:02.319 --> 03:44:03.189 align:start position:0%
again it's just really trying to focus
on

03:44:03.189 --> 03:44:03.199 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:44:05.349 --> 03:44:05.359 align:start position:0%
having a central spot
 
03:44:07.670 --> 03:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
for all these different code changes or
 
03:44:10.150 --> 03:44:10.160 align:start position:0%
amendments from the local authorities so
 
03:44:11.750 --> 03:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
that we know what they are and what we
 
03:44:13.429 --> 03:44:13.439 align:start position:0%
found in the processes as has been
 
03:44:15.670 --> 03:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned before they're not aware of
 
03:44:17.590 --> 03:44:17.600 align:start position:0%
some of them especially the towns the
 
03:44:19.349 --> 03:44:19.359 align:start position:0%
actual legal process they're supposed to
 
03:44:21.830 --> 03:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
go through by the law now so this helps
 
03:44:23.429 --> 03:44:23.439 align:start position:0%
give them that guidance make sure that
 
03:44:26.070 --> 03:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
they've done it and again make sure that
 
03:44:27.590 --> 03:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
it doesn't conflict with the codes or
 
03:44:29.670 --> 03:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
it's not less stringent then it gives us
 
03:44:31.349 --> 03:44:31.359 align:start position:0%
a central location when we're doing any
 
03:44:32.790 --> 03:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
work to go and look and see if it's
 
03:44:34.229 --> 03:44:34.239 align:start position:0%
there what those are
 
03:44:35.990 --> 03:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
instead of trying to find them
 
03:44:38.630 --> 03:44:38.640 align:start position:0%
individually for every town for in 225
 
03:44:40.389 --> 03:44:40.399 align:start position:0%
cities or whatever there are towns and
 
03:44:42.630 --> 03:44:42.640 align:start position:0%
cities across the state
 
03:44:45.429 --> 03:44:45.439 align:start position:0%
and this was part of the concerns that
 
03:44:47.189 --> 03:44:47.199 align:start position:0%
i've heard brought up and maybe i can
 
03:44:49.030 --> 03:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
answer this a little bit is this isn't
 
03:44:50.710 --> 03:44:50.720 align:start position:0%
going to really slow down a process or
 
03:44:52.469 --> 03:44:52.479 align:start position:0%
cause any issues with the town the new
 
03:44:54.550 --> 03:44:54.560 align:start position:0%
the way that the law is now for adopting
 
03:44:58.389 --> 03:44:58.399 align:start position:0%
codes after a long process before um
 
03:45:00.469 --> 03:45:00.479 align:start position:0%
is the code's trying to stay roughly one
 
03:45:03.830 --> 03:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
cycle behind and so they have two years
 
03:45:05.189 --> 03:45:05.199 align:start position:0%
while they're going through the process
 
03:45:07.590 --> 03:45:07.600 align:start position:0%
of adopting the new code to put this
 
03:45:09.670 --> 03:45:09.680 align:start position:0%
forward plenty of time there's not going
 
03:45:11.670 --> 03:45:11.680 align:start position:0%
to be a delay by the building the pump
 
03:45:13.750 --> 03:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
the building code review board probably
 
03:45:15.269 --> 03:45:15.279 align:start position:0%
because they meet once a month
 
03:45:16.870 --> 03:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
occasionally they miss the summer month
 
03:45:19.189 --> 03:45:19.199 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason but they meet every
 
03:45:21.030 --> 03:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
month pretty much and they would deduct
 
03:45:23.030 --> 03:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
they would take it up then if not but
 
03:45:24.550 --> 03:45:24.560 align:start position:0%
they have two years right now they're
 
03:45:27.349 --> 03:45:27.359 align:start position:0%
trying to adopt the 2018 code in in
 
03:45:29.910 --> 03:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
senate bill and house bill 1681 and
 
03:45:31.349 --> 03:45:31.359 align:start position:0%
that's going to adopt those codes but
 
03:45:34.309 --> 03:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
they're also working on the 2021 codes
 
03:45:35.750 --> 03:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
so they're already there so if they have
 
03:45:36.870 --> 03:45:36.880 align:start position:0%
these amendments they have plenty of
 
03:45:38.630 --> 03:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
time and penalty opportunity to bring
 
03:45:40.710 --> 03:45:40.720 align:start position:0%
these forward and submit them and go
 
03:45:41.830 --> 03:45:41.840 align:start position:0%
through the billing code board so
 
03:45:42.950 --> 03:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
hopefully that answers some of the
 
03:45:45.510 --> 03:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
questions it's it's important to give us
 
03:45:47.110 --> 03:45:47.120 align:start position:0%
that central location for everything and
 
03:45:48.710 --> 03:45:48.720 align:start position:0%
understand it and just make sure they're
 
03:45:50.630 --> 03:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
following properly you know we run into
 
03:45:52.389 --> 03:45:52.399 align:start position:0%
some situations in the town where as
 
03:45:55.110 --> 03:45:55.120 align:start position:0%
representative maguire try to explain
 
03:45:57.189 --> 03:45:57.199 align:start position:0%

some of the inspectors want certain
 
03:46:13.670 --> 03:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
things and this just allows us to make
 
03:46:16.070 --> 03:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
sure we're aware of what they are
 
03:46:17.830 --> 03:46:17.840 align:start position:0%

03:47:45.110 --> 03:47:45.120 align:start position:0%
sponsor on senate bill 313.
 
03:47:46.790 --> 03:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
this is kind of the bill that would not
 
03:47:46.800 --> 03:47:48.150 align:start position:0%
this is kind of the bill that would not
die

03:47:48.150 --> 03:47:48.160 align:start position:0%
die
 
03:47:51.110 --> 03:47:51.120 align:start position:0%
uh pandemic omnibus all whatever but
 
03:47:53.030 --> 03:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
it's a very necessary bill and i'm of
 
03:47:54.950 --> 03:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
the understanding that there may be some
 
03:47:56.389 --> 03:47:56.399 align:start position:0%
amendments to it because of work this
 
03:47:57.830 --> 03:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
committee has done on the house side and
 
03:47:59.990 --> 03:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
i'm fine with that
 
03:48:01.429 --> 03:48:01.439 align:start position:0%
office of professional licensure and
 
03:48:03.030 --> 03:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
certification has been somewhat of a
 
03:48:06.469 --> 03:48:06.479 align:start position:0%
bastard stepchild since its inception
 
03:48:06.479 --> 03:48:07.349 align:start position:0%
bastard stepchild since its inception
and

03:48:07.349 --> 03:48:07.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:48:08.389 --> 03:48:08.399 align:start position:0%
it's had gone through a number of
 
03:48:11.830 --> 03:48:11.840 align:start position:0%
directors gone through a number of
 
03:48:14.550 --> 03:48:14.560 align:start position:0%
of changes in location uh cost structure
 
03:48:16.550 --> 03:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
changes and so forth under under the
 
03:48:18.389 --> 03:48:18.399 align:start position:0%
current stewardship of executive
 
03:48:20.229 --> 03:48:20.239 align:start position:0%
director lindsey courtney i think it's
 
03:48:21.830 --> 03:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
going in the right direction
 
03:48:24.070 --> 03:48:24.080 align:start position:0%
uh this bill is helping to solve
 
03:48:25.429 --> 03:48:25.439 align:start position:0%
problems that we have with the
 
03:48:28.550 --> 03:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
relationship between the director and
 
03:48:30.630 --> 03:48:30.640 align:start position:0%
the boards and those are problems
 
03:48:32.469 --> 03:48:32.479 align:start position:0%
sometimes related to
 
03:48:32.479 --> 03:48:33.670 align:start position:0%
sometimes related to
authority

03:48:33.670 --> 03:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
authority
 
03:48:35.390 --> 03:48:35.400 align:start position:0%
uh sometimes related to
 
03:48:35.400 --> 03:48:37.670 align:start position:0%
uh sometimes related to
[Music]

03:48:37.670 --> 03:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:48:39.750 --> 03:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
knowledge base and so forth so we're
 
03:48:41.590 --> 03:48:41.600 align:start position:0%
morphing from the old system into the
 
03:48:43.349 --> 03:48:43.359 align:start position:0%
new where oplc will be basically the
 
03:48:45.670 --> 03:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
oversight system for administration of
 
03:48:47.110 --> 03:48:47.120 align:start position:0%
fees and
 
03:48:50.150 --> 03:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
um and application process for
 
03:48:51.910 --> 03:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
i would say the entire panorama of
 
03:48:53.990 --> 03:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
agencies of which there are numbers
 
03:48:55.590 --> 03:48:55.600 align:start position:0%
many as you know
 
03:48:57.110 --> 03:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
so um
 
03:48:58.550 --> 03:48:58.560 align:start position:0%
it um
 
03:49:03.590 --> 03:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
it it takes out specific fee amounts
 
03:49:05.670 --> 03:49:05.680 align:start position:0%
that are currently in statute
 
03:49:07.990 --> 03:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
and enables then the body the the
 
03:49:09.590 --> 03:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
governing board or the licensure board
 
03:49:11.590 --> 03:49:11.600 align:start position:0%
to work with the oplc director to
 
03:49:13.429 --> 03:49:13.439 align:start position:0%
establish a fee consistent with what the
 
03:49:16.790 --> 03:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
law says 125 provision and so forth some
 
03:49:18.870 --> 03:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
of those uh organizations some of the
 
03:49:20.790 --> 03:49:20.800 align:start position:0%
boards are not within that some are some
 
03:49:22.229 --> 03:49:22.239 align:start position:0%
are paying way too much some are paying
 
03:49:24.309 --> 03:49:24.319 align:start position:0%
not enough that all gets worked out and
 
03:49:25.750 --> 03:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
i think that'll probably be the result
 
03:49:28.630 --> 03:49:28.640 align:start position:0%
of the study committee
 
03:49:30.309 --> 03:49:30.319 align:start position:0%
in whatever form that study committee
 
03:49:32.950 --> 03:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
comes out as i said i spoke to
 
03:49:35.189 --> 03:49:35.199 align:start position:0%
chair maguire and
 
03:49:36.870 --> 03:49:36.880 align:start position:0%
she's indicated that you've done some
 
03:49:38.469 --> 03:49:38.479 align:start position:0%
work on that the point is we need to
 
03:49:40.389 --> 03:49:40.399 align:start position:0%
solve the problem get that oplc up into
 
03:49:41.990 --> 03:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
a state of operating efficiency that'll
 
03:49:43.830 --> 03:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
do the job we intended to do six years
 
03:49:45.910 --> 03:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
when we put it together six years ago
 
03:49:47.830 --> 03:49:47.840 align:start position:0%
i'll take any questions
 
03:49:49.429 --> 03:49:49.439 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions to the committee
 
03:49:49.439 --> 03:49:50.630 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions to the committee
um

03:49:50.630 --> 03:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:53.030 --> 03:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
peter representative schmidt
 
03:49:55.030 --> 03:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman good to see you up
 
03:49:56.790 --> 03:49:56.800 align:start position:0%
there sir
 
03:50:00.309 --> 03:50:00.319 align:start position:0%
uh good afternoon senator so uh the the
 
03:50:01.830 --> 03:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
purpose of the
 
03:50:03.349 --> 03:50:03.359 align:start position:0%
study committee
 
03:50:04.950 --> 03:50:04.960 align:start position:0%
is a little bit limited and i'm
 
03:50:06.950 --> 03:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
wondering whether
 
03:50:06.960 --> 03:50:07.910 align:start position:0%
wondering whether
you

03:50:07.910 --> 03:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:50:10.070 --> 03:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
would be comfortable with the idea
 
03:50:12.790 --> 03:50:12.800 align:start position:0%
that the that the committee
 
03:50:14.710 --> 03:50:14.720 align:start position:0%
could look at
 
03:50:17.110 --> 03:50:17.120 align:start position:0%
other issues that arise
 
03:50:19.110 --> 03:50:19.120 align:start position:0%
in their deliberations
 
03:50:21.750 --> 03:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
with regard to the pursuit of
 
03:50:25.590 --> 03:50:25.600 align:start position:0%
improvement in the operation of oplc
 
03:50:25.600 --> 03:50:26.870 align:start position:0%
improvement in the operation of oplc
uh

03:50:26.870 --> 03:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:50:29.429 --> 03:50:29.439 align:start position:0%
along this you know specific specified
 
03:50:29.439 --> 03:50:31.189 align:start position:0%
along this you know specific specified
lines

03:50:31.189 --> 03:50:31.199 align:start position:0%
lines
 
03:50:33.429 --> 03:50:33.439 align:start position:0%
because you know
 
03:50:35.349 --> 03:50:35.359 align:start position:0%
some of us on the committee have been
 
03:50:37.030 --> 03:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
working on this for a long time and are
 
03:50:40.229 --> 03:50:40.239 align:start position:0%
very concerned about getting oplc to be
 
03:50:41.750 --> 03:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
more in the direction
 
03:50:45.030 --> 03:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
of uh what what was intended originally
 
03:50:47.750 --> 03:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
um and and i i wouldn't want to see the
 
03:50:49.030 --> 03:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
study committee
 
03:50:51.590 --> 03:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
uh overlook something that
 
03:50:52.870 --> 03:50:52.880 align:start position:0%
maybe is not
 
03:50:56.070 --> 03:50:56.080 align:start position:0%
narrowly what it's supposed to be doing
 
03:50:59.110 --> 03:50:59.120 align:start position:0%
i know that the the the request to look
 
03:50:59.120 --> 03:51:00.830 align:start position:0%
i know that the the the request to look
at

03:51:00.830 --> 03:51:00.840 align:start position:0%
at
 
03:51:03.110 --> 03:51:03.120 align:start position:0%
um relative to the funding was
 
03:51:05.750 --> 03:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
specifically from the executive director
 
03:51:06.790 --> 03:51:06.800 align:start position:0%
and so

um

03:52:34.150 --> 03:52:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:34.160 --> 03:52:35.590 align:start position:0%
 
and

03:52:35.590 --> 03:52:35.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:52:37.670 --> 03:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
like i said if anyone wants to talk to
 
03:52:39.510 --> 03:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
me about any either of them i'd be
 
03:52:39.520 --> 03:52:41.030 align:start position:0%
me about any either of them i'd be
delighted

03:52:41.030 --> 03:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
delighted
 
03:52:43.030 --> 03:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
i will be sending them out this weekend
 
03:52:47.269 --> 03:52:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:48.469 --> 03:52:48.479 align:start position:0%
what else
 
03:52:50.229 --> 03:52:50.239 align:start position:0%
what are the other ones
 
03:52:52.389 --> 03:52:52.399 align:start position:0%
are you intending to exec any bills
 
03:52:52.399 --> 03:52:53.510 align:start position:0%
are you intending to exec any bills
today

03:52:53.510 --> 03:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
today
 
03:52:55.269 --> 03:52:55.279 align:start position:0%
i don't think so we don't there are a
 
03:52:57.429 --> 03:52:57.439 align:start position:0%
number of people who aren't here
 
03:53:00.389 --> 03:53:00.399 align:start position:0%
and i told the people who said they were
 
03:53:02.790 --> 03:53:02.800 align:start position:0%
going to be here that would only exact
 
03:53:05.830 --> 03:53:05.840 align:start position:0%
the obvious and i don't and
 
03:53:07.750 --> 03:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
after the hearings i doubt if any of
 
03:53:09.990 --> 03:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
these are obvious
 
03:53:14.950 --> 03:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:14.960 --> 03:53:15.910 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:53:15.910 --> 03:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:53:19.750 --> 03:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
we will be executing these on tuesday
 
03:53:22.309 --> 03:53:22.319 align:start position:0%
most likely
 
03:53:23.910 --> 03:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
and therefore if you're not going to be
 
03:53:26.070 --> 03:53:26.080 align:start position:0%
here on tuesday please
 
03:53:28.070 --> 03:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
let me know and i will deal with the
 
03:53:30.309 --> 03:53:30.319 align:start position:0%
majority or minority office to get a
 
03:53:30.319 --> 03:53:33.429 align:start position:0%
majority or minority office to get a
replacement

03:53:33.429 --> 03:53:33.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:35.750 --> 03:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
and that i think is the main thing and
 
03:53:39.110 --> 03:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
i'll talk about any of the uh
 
03:53:41.510 --> 03:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
yeah talk to me in person about the
 
03:53:44.389 --> 03:53:44.399 align:start position:0%
amendments and we'll um
 
03:53:45.750 --> 03:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
if you have if you have any other
 
03:53:48.150 --> 03:53:48.160 align:start position:0%
amendments please do uh get them and
 
03:53:50.469 --> 03:53:50.479 align:start position:0%
send them out as far in advance as you
 
03:53:50.479 --> 03:53:52.550 align:start position:0%
send them out as far in advance as you
can

03:53:52.550 --> 03:53:52.560 align:start position:0%
can
 
03:53:52.560 --> 03:53:54.309 align:start position:0%
can
john

03:53:54.309 --> 03:53:54.319 align:start position:0%
john
 
03:53:56.630 --> 03:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
443 needs an amendment
 
03:53:59.110 --> 03:53:59.120 align:start position:0%
443 needs an amendment
 
03:54:01.670 --> 03:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
uh the last line because the building
 
03:54:03.830 --> 03:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
code review board wants to make sure
 
03:54:07.670 --> 03:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
they have the procedural history before
 
03:54:07.680 --> 03:54:08.950 align:start position:0%
they have the procedural history before
finally

03:54:08.950 --> 03:54:08.960 align:start position:0%
finally
 
03:54:08.960 --> 03:54:10.070 align:start position:0%
finally
approving

03:54:10.070 --> 03:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
approving
 
03:54:10.080 --> 03:54:11.030 align:start position:0%
approving
so

03:54:11.030 --> 03:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:54:13.349 --> 03:54:13.359 align:start position:0%
it says it the
 
03:54:14.950 --> 03:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
shall be submitted to the board within
 
03:54:18.550 --> 03:54:18.560 align:start position:0%
30 days of enactment or adoption i just
 
03:54:21.030 --> 03:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to add and prior to enforcement
 
03:54:21.040 --> 03:54:21.750 align:start position:0%
wanted to add and prior to enforcement
okay

03:54:21.750 --> 03:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:54:24.870 --> 03:54:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:26.550 --> 03:54:26.560 align:start position:0%
while it may not take a lot of time what
 
03:54:30.309 --> 03:54:30.319 align:start position:0%
about the 363 the group two do you think
 
03:54:33.030 --> 03:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
that's going to come is that an issue
 
03:54:35.030 --> 03:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
that one might be that's the only one i
 
03:54:36.950 --> 03:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
could see we might possibly do today do
 
03:54:40.150 --> 03:54:40.160 align:start position:0%
you want to make a motion i i'll move uh
 
03:54:43.590 --> 03:54:43.600 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on 363. hey second
 
03:54:43.600 --> 03:54:44.790 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on 363. hey second
okay

03:54:44.790 --> 03:54:44.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:54:48.070 --> 03:54:48.080 align:start position:0%
i reserve the right to uh
 
03:54:50.469 --> 03:54:50.479 align:start position:0%
recess this if it appears to be
 
03:54:52.389 --> 03:54:52.399 align:start position:0%
more controversial
 
03:54:52.399 --> 03:55:08.950 align:start position:0%
more controversial
okay

03:55:08.950 --> 03:55:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:11.429 --> 03:55:11.439 align:start position:0%
the case made
 
03:55:11.439 --> 03:55:12.790 align:start position:0%
the case made
by

03:55:12.790 --> 03:55:12.800 align:start position:0%
by
 
03:55:12.800 --> 03:55:13.510 align:start position:0%
by
the

03:55:13.510 --> 03:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:55:16.229 --> 03:55:16.239 align:start position:0%
people who supported this bill was that
 
03:55:18.630 --> 03:55:18.640 align:start position:0%
it was an attempt to head in the
 
03:55:21.110 --> 03:55:21.120 align:start position:0%
direction of fairness
 
03:55:22.950 --> 03:55:22.960 align:start position:0%
and i think we
 
03:55:25.269 --> 03:55:25.279 align:start position:0%
uh should support that
 
03:55:27.750 --> 03:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
uh my view is i really don't like the
 
03:55:29.910 --> 03:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
build because while i don't want to do
 
03:55:32.550 --> 03:55:32.560 align:start position:0%
the work i do not like the idea that you
 
03:55:34.790 --> 03:55:34.800 align:start position:0%
missed by two months and you are out
 
03:55:36.950 --> 03:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
you've got to do the whole
 
03:55:38.870 --> 03:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
buy out thing there should have been i
 
03:55:41.030 --> 03:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
don't like
 
03:55:43.110 --> 03:55:43.120 align:start position:0%
cliffs i like ramps
 
03:55:45.750 --> 03:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not as i said prepared to do the
 
03:55:47.510 --> 03:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
work at this hour
 
03:55:50.150 --> 03:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
on that bill but at least this is a step
 
03:55:52.790 --> 03:55:52.800 align:start position:0%
in the right direction so on the grounds
 
03:55:52.800 --> 03:55:53.750 align:start position:0%
in the right direction so on the grounds
of

03:55:53.750 --> 03:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:55:55.750 --> 03:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
fairness uh
 
03:55:58.870 --> 03:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
limited fairness i support the concept
 
03:56:02.070 --> 03:56:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:04.790 --> 03:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
okay and the second was by president
 
03:56:05.910 --> 03:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
broder do you wish to speak to your
 
03:56:08.229 --> 03:56:08.239 align:start position:0%
second i'd like to add thank you yes
 
03:56:09.349 --> 03:56:09.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:56:11.750 --> 03:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
madam chair i'd like to add that
 
03:56:11.760 --> 03:56:12.790 align:start position:0%
madam chair i'd like to add that
the

03:56:12.790 --> 03:56:12.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:56:15.429 --> 03:56:15.439 align:start position:0%
um burden of this buyback is on the
 
03:56:15.439 --> 03:56:17.269 align:start position:0%
um burden of this buyback is on the
employee

03:56:17.269 --> 03:56:17.279 align:start position:0%
employee
 
03:56:19.349 --> 03:56:19.359 align:start position:0%
and we heard testimony today that there
 
03:56:21.590 --> 03:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
is there are interested
 
03:56:24.389 --> 03:56:24.399 align:start position:0%
people that would take advantage of this
 
03:56:24.399 --> 03:56:25.670 align:start position:0%
people that would take advantage of this
and

03:56:25.670 --> 03:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:56:27.670 --> 03:56:27.680 align:start position:0%
therefore i
 
03:56:31.189 --> 03:56:31.199 align:start position:0%
um sucking into the bill and support
 
03:56:34.309 --> 03:56:34.319 align:start position:0%
representative syjek's motion
 
03:56:37.990 --> 03:56:38.000 align:start position:0%
right anyone else representative schmidt
 
03:56:39.590 --> 03:56:39.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:56:42.630 --> 03:56:42.640 align:start position:0%
so i i thought that we were going to
 
03:56:43.750 --> 03:56:43.760 align:start position:0%
see in
 
03:56:45.750 --> 03:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
a motion to approve
 
03:56:47.670 --> 03:56:47.680 align:start position:0%
363 as well
 
03:56:50.710 --> 03:56:50.720 align:start position:0%
i i thought the case in and
 
03:56:52.630 --> 03:56:52.640 align:start position:0%
made in support
 
03:56:56.389 --> 03:56:56.399 align:start position:0%
of the bill was so overwhelming uh that
 
03:56:56.399 --> 03:56:57.269 align:start position:0%
of the bill was so overwhelming uh that
um

03:56:57.269 --> 03:56:57.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:56:59.030 --> 03:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
that even though it
 
03:57:00.710 --> 03:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
puts all the burden
 
03:57:03.269 --> 03:57:03.279 align:start position:0%
on the employees when the
 
03:57:03.279 --> 03:57:04.229 align:start position:0%
on the employees when the
fault

03:57:04.229 --> 03:57:04.239 align:start position:0%
fault
 
03:57:04.239 --> 03:57:05.030 align:start position:0%
fault
of

03:57:05.030 --> 03:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:57:06.389 --> 03:57:06.399 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
03:57:09.830 --> 03:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
the situation that that uh caused the
 
03:57:09.840 --> 03:57:11.189 align:start position:0%
the situation that that uh caused the
the

03:57:11.189 --> 03:57:11.199 align:start position:0%
the

the uh
 
03:57:17.590 --> 03:57:17.600 align:start position:0%
change in the statute back in about 2006
 
03:57:22.070 --> 03:57:22.080 align:start position:0%
was uh was not theirs um nevertheless we
 
03:57:23.830 --> 03:57:23.840 align:start position:0%
put them in a box
 
03:57:26.070 --> 03:57:26.080 align:start position:0%
that uh that
 
03:57:29.030 --> 03:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
that they need some kind of relief and
 
03:57:31.830 --> 03:57:31.840 align:start position:0%
even if this is an imperfect bill uh i
 
03:57:33.670 --> 03:57:33.680 align:start position:0%
think it moves in the right direction
 
03:57:35.910 --> 03:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
and does something for
 
03:57:38.229 --> 03:57:38.239 align:start position:0%
these people who are clearly under a lot
 
03:57:42.229 --> 03:57:42.239 align:start position:0%
of duress so i will enthusiastically
 
03:57:43.910 --> 03:57:43.920 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chair yes
 
03:57:50.150 --> 03:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
i was reminded while we were
 
03:57:52.550 --> 03:57:52.560 align:start position:0%
having the hearing on this bill of
 
03:57:54.070 --> 03:57:54.080 align:start position:0%
those of us who've been on the committee
 
03:57:56.469 --> 03:57:56.479 align:start position:0%
for a little while recall
 
03:57:59.030 --> 03:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
an attempt that representative pearson
 
03:58:00.630 --> 03:58:00.640 align:start position:0%
made to try and
 
03:58:02.469 --> 03:58:02.479 align:start position:0%
rectify the
 
03:58:04.710 --> 03:58:04.720 align:start position:0%
case of many of these folks
 
03:58:07.269 --> 03:58:07.279 align:start position:0%
we literally had dozens
 
03:58:09.590 --> 03:58:09.600 align:start position:0%
of people who were in this position come
 
03:58:11.510 --> 03:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
in and testify
 
03:58:13.990 --> 03:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
while this bill doesn't make them
 
03:58:16.870 --> 03:58:16.880 align:start position:0%
as whole as that bill would have i
 
03:58:19.189 --> 03:58:19.199 align:start position:0%
certainly wholeheartedly support
 
03:58:21.510 --> 03:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
uh the attempt to give them some kind of
 
03:58:21.520 --> 03:58:24.229 align:start position:0%
uh the attempt to give them some kind of
respite

03:58:24.229 --> 03:58:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:24.239 --> 03:58:25.670 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:58:25.670 --> 03:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:58:27.269 --> 03:58:27.279 align:start position:0%
representative lackas
 
03:58:29.110 --> 03:58:29.120 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah i came into this uh not
 
03:58:30.630 --> 03:58:30.640 align:start position:0%
really having an objection to the bill
 
03:58:32.389 --> 03:58:32.399 align:start position:0%
but being skeptical there was any point
 
03:58:33.910 --> 03:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
to it given the amount of money people
 
03:58:35.510 --> 03:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
have to pay but
 
03:58:37.349 --> 03:58:37.359 align:start position:0%
given the testimony especially from the
 
03:58:38.790 --> 03:58:38.800 align:start position:0%
lady from the department of corrections
 
03:58:40.309 --> 03:58:40.319 align:start position:0%
i understand
 
03:58:43.030 --> 03:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
why they might want it and
 
03:58:44.790 --> 03:58:44.800 align:start position:0%
and so i think it's worth the small
 
03:58:46.870 --> 03:58:46.880 align:start position:0%
amount of money startup money to to go
 
03:58:49.670 --> 03:58:49.680 align:start position:0%

03:58:49.680 --> 03:58:50.790 align:start position:0%

yeah i i would say that
 
03:58:59.510 --> 03:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
offering these people the opportunity to
 
03:59:02.550 --> 03:59:02.560 align:start position:0%
improve their pensions at their own cost
 
03:59:02.560 --> 03:59:03.750 align:start position:0%
