and a lot to discuss in a variety of
 
00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
different ways um i guess what i'd first
 
00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:37.599 align:start position:0%
uh like to do
 
00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
um should we introduce folks

yeah sure let's
 
00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:42.319 align:start position:0%
you know i'm just gonna have everyone go

right around the table and at least uh
 
00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 align:start position:0%
introduce themselves because i know
 
00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:46.879 align:start position:0%
there could be questions for various
 
00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 align:start position:0%

thank you didn't see you down there um
 
00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 align:start position:0%
well thank you i'm going to open things
 
00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 align:start position:0%
up with it with just with a few remarks
 
00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 align:start position:0%
i think it's important to kind of set
 
00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
not just where we're going but doing
 
00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
things there we have very different
 
00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
dynamics different variables that i
 
00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 align:start position:0%
think we're going to have to understand
 
00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:03.039 align:start position:0%
as we go into the both the capital and
 
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 align:start position:0%
operational budget uh into next year uh
 
00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 align:start position:0%
we have uh a tough economy ahead of us
 
00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
there's no doubt about that and and
 
00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
that's being polite about it frankly i
 
00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
believe the first uh group we're going
 
00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
to hear from this morning the first
 
00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
agency if you will um is the university
 
00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 align:start position:0%
system uh and we can we'll talk a little
 
00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
bit about that but
 
00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
i do want to back up and just uh set a
 
00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
context if you will
 
00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
for really what's ahead
 
00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
i think the state has done a phenomenal
 
00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919 align:start position:0%
job managing our finances there's no
 
00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:33.039 align:start position:0%
question about that we have one of the
 
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
strongest economies in the country we
 
00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.240 align:start position:0%
have beyond record surpluses beyond
 
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
revenues that frankly nobody could could
 
00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
predict or imagine so that gives us a
 
00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 align:start position:0%
lot of opportunity but there is a lot of
 
00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:46.639 align:start position:0%
need out there as well uh every when we
 
00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
talk about our surplus funds uh we're
 
00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:50.479 align:start position:0%
talking about having to supplement
 
00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:53.039 align:start position:0%
energy costs in in the heating oil costs
 
00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
and offsetting some of the inflationary
 
00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:56.639 align:start position:0%
costs for individuals these are one-time
 
00:05:59.189 --> 00:05:59.199 align:start position:0%
funds uh effectively not necessarily
 
00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:00.800 align:start position:0%
directly out of the rainy day fund but
 
00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 align:start position:0%
they could be uh but you allowing the
 
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
legislature to use the surplus funds to
 
00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:06.400 align:start position:0%
help businesses and individuals across
 
00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:08.560 align:start position:0%
this state is going to be i think a
 
00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:11.039 align:start position:0%
priority uh between now and at least uh
 
00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:13.600 align:start position:0%
next year without a doubt
 
00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
uh so that doesn't necessarily mean that
 
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
we have uh gobs and gobs of money just
 
00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:19.199 align:start position:0%
to throw at capital but i think we have
 
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
ample amounts if you will
 
00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.080 align:start position:0%
then you look at what's really happening
 
00:06:26.309 --> 00:06:26.319 align:start position:0%
uh nationally and what's happening with
 
00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
credit markets i think that has to take
 
00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:30.560 align:start position:0%
be taken into very serious consideration
 
00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:33.039 align:start position:0%
by uh by folks first you have the supply
 
00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
chain issues we all know about that then
 
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
you have the inflationary cost
 
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of what we talk about over the
 
00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
next couple days with our capital budget
 
00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
is building bricks and mortar and
 
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and that's all very very
 
00:06:46.469 --> 00:06:46.479 align:start position:0%
important stuff
 
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
but you have to understand also that the
 
00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:50.800 align:start position:0%
costs of doing that are are well beyond
 
00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
the 8.3 inflationary rate that we see uh
 
00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
the construction costs are are just
 
00:06:58.629 --> 00:06:58.639 align:start position:0%
absolutely skyrocketing in some place uh
 
00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:00.639 align:start position:0%
30 to 100
 
00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:03.199 align:start position:0%
over typically what we would get for the
 
00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
same dollar
 
00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
in a given year
 
00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:07.919 align:start position:0%
there is competition because of the
 
00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
supply chain issue so every time we do a
 
00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:12.080 align:start position:0%
project let's remember that we are
 
00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:14.639 align:start position:0%
taking supply chain product from other
 
00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
private companies or other projects
 
00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:17.360 align:start position:0%
around the state and there's just a
 
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
limited amount that's going to be
 
00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
available you have projects that should
 
00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
be done in two months that are literally
 
00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
taking a year we're seeing that across
 
00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:26.800 align:start position:0%
the country i don't see that uh lifting
 
00:07:29.589 --> 00:07:29.599 align:start position:0%
anytime soon so we have to consider uh
 
00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
supply chain issues how we cost things
 
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
out how we plan and how we budget what
 
00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:35.120 align:start position:0%
we don't want to do is get into a
 
00:07:36.309 --> 00:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
situation where we're creating
 
00:07:38.309 --> 00:07:38.319 align:start position:0%
engineering design and costs for a
 
00:07:40.629 --> 00:07:40.639 align:start position:0%
million dollars only to find next year
 
00:07:42.309 --> 00:07:42.319 align:start position:0%
uh when we when we have to actually pay
 
00:07:43.589 --> 00:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
the bill that it's a two million dollar
 
00:07:43.599 --> 00:07:45.029 align:start position:0%
the bill that it's a two million dollar
project

00:07:45.029 --> 00:07:45.039 align:start position:0%
project
 
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
and then on top of that you have this
 
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
little thing called interest rates uh
 
00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:52.240 align:start position:0%
the cost of borrowing a dollar right now
 
00:07:54.869 --> 00:07:54.879 align:start position:0%
is high and it's only going up there's
 
00:07:57.589 --> 00:07:57.599 align:start position:0%
no two ways about that uh this in this
 
00:07:58.629 --> 00:07:58.639 align:start position:0%
uh in
 
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
inflation that you're seeing is very
 
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
real and lord knows i am not the premier
 
00:08:05.029 --> 00:08:05.039 align:start position:0%
economist but it is very basic math it
 
00:08:06.869 --> 00:08:06.879 align:start position:0%
is actually very simple math to know
 
00:08:08.629 --> 00:08:08.639 align:start position:0%
that interest rates have to keep going
 
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
higher to outpace inflation to get this
 
00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
economy back into line and unfortunately
 
00:08:15.029 --> 00:08:15.039 align:start position:0%
what you're going to see is a stagnated
 
00:08:17.189 --> 00:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
economy and you are going to see some
 
00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:19.759 align:start position:0%
form of a recession regardless of what
 
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
the nonsense politics out of washington
 
00:08:24.309 --> 00:08:24.319 align:start position:0%
are everybody knows that some realistic
 
00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:26.720 align:start position:0%
recession is coming
 
00:08:28.629 --> 00:08:28.639 align:start position:0%
then we have our arpa funds let's not
 
00:08:30.469 --> 00:08:30.479 align:start position:0%
forget that when you inject five
 
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
trillion dollars into the economy over a
 
00:08:33.829 --> 00:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
period of two years that's what's
 
00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
creating the inflationary issue but a
 
00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
lot of that has come out in terms of
 
00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
infrastructure so we do have our
 
00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:40.320 align:start position:0%
infrastructure bill which primarily goes
 
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
to the roads bridges broadband waterways
 
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
about a trillion dollars was authorized
 
00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
by the federal government about a year
 
00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:47.430 align:start position:0%
by the federal government about a year
ago

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
ago
 
00:08:49.509 --> 00:08:49.519 align:start position:0%
most of the i don't think a single penny
 
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
of that money has actually really been
 
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
spent yet the first dollars are just
 
00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
being released into broadband new
 
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire's doing a phenomenal job with
 
00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:57.680 align:start position:0%
that um we're going to be the first
 
00:08:59.750 --> 00:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
state in the country that invests in our
 
00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
expanded broadband here uh through the
 
00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
arpa funds which is great being first at
 
00:09:05.269 --> 00:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
the trough means that you you're
 
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:07.360 align:start position:0%
more likely to have the supply actually
 
00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
have the product i actually have the
 
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
labor force to put it in the ground and
 
00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
that's that's phenomenal and i really
 
00:09:14.389 --> 00:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
commend the folks at bea for for making
 
00:09:15.829 --> 00:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
sure we were number one in the country
 
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:16.720 align:start position:0%
on that
 
00:09:17.829 --> 00:09:17.839 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
what you really also under have to
 
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
understand is we already have a lot of
 
00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
money coming in for for buildings for
 
00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
bridges for roads for all of these
 
00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
pieces and so that definitely has to be
 
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:28.720 align:start position:0%
taken into account there's already a lot
 
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
of infrastructure development going on
 
00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
uh to to walk kind of parallel path with
 
00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:36.160 align:start position:0%
the capital budget that we're talking
 
00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:38.240 align:start position:0%
about today
 
00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.750 align:start position:0%
about today
um

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:40.790 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
where it ends up
 
00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
i think i i'm not i don't want to put
 
00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
anything in stone as to exactly what
 
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
i'll be proposing next february but one
 
00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
thing to consider and i think we should
 
00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
hear about all the projects but i've
 
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
gone back to all the different agencies
 
00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
and typically you know they'll come in
 
00:09:58.550 --> 00:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
and we'll see a presentation of 40 plus
 
00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
agencies uh and you could see anywhere
 
00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.069 align:start position:0%
agencies uh and you could see anywhere
from

00:10:02.069 --> 00:10:02.079 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:10:05.269 --> 00:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
400 to 800 million dollars in projects
 
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
that is not reality that is not going to
 
00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
happen uh we're likely uh going the
 
00:10:12.069 --> 00:10:12.079 align:start position:0%
state is going to look at authorizing
 
00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:14.720 align:start position:0%
this expenditure of 125 million should
 
00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:16.640 align:start position:0%
that all be bonded i personally don't
 
00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
think so we can we'll have that debate
 
00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
and we'll find out where those funds
 
00:10:21.829 --> 00:10:21.839 align:start position:0%
come from but the reality is i think
 
00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
we'll have surplus funds to use cash to
 
00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
minimize the bonding capacity that we
 
00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
otherwise would use because the interest
 
00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:30.720 align:start position:0%
rate alone on this money will be
 
00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
astronomical if we're not smart about
 
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:35.200 align:start position:0%
how we do it so by creating a strong
 
00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
economy by being smart with our surplus
 
00:10:38.389 --> 00:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
revenues that's going to give us the
 
00:10:39.829 --> 00:10:39.839 align:start position:0%
opportunity to still invest in these
 
00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
projects but a lot of it with our own
 
00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:42.720 align:start position:0%
cash at
 
00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:44.240 align:start position:0%
effectively zero percent interest and
 
00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
that's a good thing
 
00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
we'll still i think should go out and
 
00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
borrow i think the markets are still
 
00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
will be fairly healthy but at the same
 
00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
time we have to be smart about where we
 
00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.389 align:start position:0%
time we have to be smart about where we
go

00:10:54.389 --> 00:10:54.399 align:start position:0%
go
 
00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
we still have some very large projects i
 
00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:58.240 align:start position:0%
don't want to go into too much but i'll
 
00:10:59.910 --> 00:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
let the departments talk about but
 
00:11:02.069 --> 00:11:02.079 align:start position:0%
there's two specific uh
 
00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh projects i want to talk about one is
 
00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
the men's state prison
 
00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
this project has to be done at some
 
00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:10.640 align:start position:0%
point probably not in the next couple
 
00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:11.509 align:start position:0%
point probably not in the next couple
years

00:11:11.509 --> 00:11:11.519 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
uh we're not prepared for that we but i
 
00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
think in the next five to ten years you
 
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
are looking at a 350 to 500 million
 
00:11:21.269 --> 00:11:21.279 align:start position:0%
dollar investment that this state will
 
00:11:24.069 --> 00:11:24.079 align:start position:0%
have to make in the men's state prison
 
00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:27.200 align:start position:0%
um that's a reality uh i don't i've
 
00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:28.640 align:start position:0%
talked to commissioner hanks and she
 
00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:30.640 align:start position:0%
agrees uh oh commissioner you are here
 
00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:32.240 align:start position:0%
how are you well i don't want to speak
 
00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
for the commissioner but uh we talked
 
00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
about the need for this project it has
 
00:11:38.949 --> 00:11:38.959 align:start position:0%
to happen but we have to be prepared uh
 
00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
so i think uh i mean she'll talk about
 
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:42.240 align:start position:0%
the project and i've asked her to talk
 
00:11:45.269 --> 00:11:45.279 align:start position:0%
about it in a little more detail
 
00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
about where we go but the first step is
 
00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
really making sure we get a feasibility
 
00:11:50.389 --> 00:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
study some of the preliminary
 
00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:52.720 align:start position:0%
engineering a realistic cost estimate
 
00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:54.160 align:start position:0%
because what we really want to do is
 
00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
make sure the legislature has all the
 
00:11:57.990 --> 00:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
data and all the information possible so
 
00:11:59.350 --> 00:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
i'm not proposing moving forward with a
 
00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
350 million dollar new prison because i
 
00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
don't think we're prepared for that and
 
00:12:04.389 --> 00:12:04.399 align:start position:0%
i think borrowing that kind of money at
 
00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
this point would be um would be foolish
 
00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:09.680 align:start position:0%
frankly um so there could be a cooling
 
00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
of the markets in a couple years and
 
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
there could be a better time to do it
 
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:14.240 align:start position:0%
and a smarter time to do it as we come
 
00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
down the road but i do want the
 
00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
legislature to start having that
 
00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
discussion now and taking that
 
00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:20.240 align:start position:0%
information in understanding where we
 
00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
need to go and really making sure that
 
00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
we're thinking about the future
 
00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:26.720 align:start position:0%
the second one of the second projects i
 
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:28.160 align:start position:0%
just want to talk about is is with the
 
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
university system and we're going to
 
00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
bring them up in a moment to talk about
 
00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:33.200 align:start position:0%
some of their needs and projects but we
 
00:12:34.949 --> 00:12:34.959 align:start position:0%
made a commitment or at least i made and
 
00:12:36.949 --> 00:12:36.959 align:start position:0%
the legislature made a commitment a
 
00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:38.720 align:start position:0%
couple budget cycles ago to really make
 
00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
sure that the state was partnering and
 
00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
investing in uh in a variety of
 
00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:44.720 align:start position:0%
different projects the keene state
 
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
project plymouth state and the life
 
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
sciences project over at unh those
 
00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:50.240 align:start position:0%
projects have
 
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:51.680 align:start position:0%
have been ongoing
 
00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
some of them i guess are just starting
 
00:12:54.629 --> 00:12:54.639 align:start position:0%
but the unh project has been ongoing
 
00:12:56.389 --> 00:12:56.399 align:start position:0%
it's a multi-phase project over the next
 
00:12:57.990 --> 00:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
few years going to provide an immense
 
00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity to allow the university
 
00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
system to really come in line with where
 
00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of our direct workforce needs are
 
00:13:06.389 --> 00:13:06.399 align:start position:0%
going to be whether it's in biolife
 
00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
sciences regenerative medicine all of
 
00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
those sorts of things and create
 
00:13:10.949 --> 00:13:10.959 align:start position:0%
opportunities for those students that
 
00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
can then stay here work here really
 
00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:15.200 align:start position:0%
building our workforce i really do see
 
00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
it as an investment in new hampshire's
 
00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
future workforce uh and and uh so again
 
00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
i'll be very supportive um and and of
 
00:13:24.629 --> 00:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
making sure that we fulfill on that
 
00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
obligation we've done it in a couple
 
00:13:28.069 --> 00:13:28.079 align:start position:0%
different phases but fulfilling uh on
 
00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:30.240 align:start position:0%
that obligation as well
 
00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
um we we made a huge investment with the
 
00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
nursing school a couple years ago and
 
00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
boy i mean that's already paying
 
00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:38.240 align:start position:0%
dividends uh if there was ever a time to
 
00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
you know prepare for the oncoming need
 
00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
of nurses uh in health care workforce we
 
00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
we did that in the legislature um i did
 
00:13:46.949 --> 00:13:46.959 align:start position:0%
that a few years ago and and we've
 
00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
effectively doubled the number of nurses
 
00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
uh the opportunity for the number of
 
00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
nurses to come out of unh as our ends
 
00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
and retain them right here in new
 
00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire so those investments really do
 
00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
work um they're they're not just well it
 
00:13:58.790 --> 00:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
sounds like a good idea let's see how it
 
00:14:00.629 --> 00:14:00.639 align:start position:0%
pans out this is really an investment
 
00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
that is a
 
00:14:03.829 --> 00:14:03.839 align:start position:0%
addressing a direct need of the state
 
00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:06.160 align:start position:0%
today and without a doubt a growing need
 
00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
that's going to be there uh in the
 
00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:10.720 align:start position:0%
future so again i i think that
 
00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:12.160 align:start position:0%
just to understand where markets are
 
00:14:14.389 --> 00:14:14.399 align:start position:0%
going where interest rates are going
 
00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
um i think we have the ability to still
 
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
spend 125 million that's what i'll be
 
00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:20.240 align:start position:0%
recommending to the legislature but how
 
00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:21.680 align:start position:0%
we parse that out i think will be a
 
00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
little bit different i think we just
 
00:14:24.389 --> 00:14:24.399 align:start position:0%
need to be smarter about not just saying
 
00:14:26.629 --> 00:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
well we're going to borrow 125 million
 
00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:28.720 align:start position:0%
on a very inflated interest rate market
 
00:14:30.389 --> 00:14:30.399 align:start position:0%
that might only be growing
 
00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
in the coming years
 
00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:34.240 align:start position:0%
and also remember you know not to get
 
00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
too technical but when we authorize the
 
00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
funding when we sign that capital budget
 
00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
next june that doesn't mean we borrow
 
00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
the money the next day right sometimes
 
00:14:43.269 --> 00:14:43.279 align:start position:0%
we borrow the money six
 
00:14:45.189 --> 00:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
six months a year even 18 months down
 
00:14:47.189 --> 00:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
the road because we have to time it to
 
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
the projects as they come to fruition so
 
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
the unknown escalation of that interest
 
00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
rate market is something else that the
 
00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
legislature will really have to consider
 
00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
and hopefully as we go through the
 
00:14:58.949 --> 00:14:58.959 align:start position:0%
process between now and february and all
 
00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
through next spring we'll all have a
 
00:15:02.389 --> 00:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
better sense of of where this is where
 
00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
this economy is really playing out and
 
00:15:05.189 --> 00:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
where that that market plays out and
 
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
then i think we can really have a
 
00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
more deeper discussion about where the
 
00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
dollars come from but we're in good
 
00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
shape here there's no doubt about it new
 
00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire's in good shape to make these
 
00:15:15.509 --> 00:15:15.519 align:start position:0%
investments one way or the other um
 
00:15:16.629 --> 00:15:16.639 align:start position:0%
we're just going to make sure that we're
 
00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
looking at prioritizing the last thing
 
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
i'm going to i want to mention really
 
00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
quick uh again i got to back up to a
 
00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
point i brought up earlier typically
 
00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
we'll see 500 million or even 900
 
00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
million dollars of projects come before
 
00:15:30.069 --> 00:15:30.079 align:start position:0%
this group in a combination of general
 
00:15:31.509 --> 00:15:31.519 align:start position:0%
funds and
 
00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
and uh federal funds other money highway
 
00:15:35.749 --> 00:15:35.759 align:start position:0%
funds i've really asked the departments
 
00:15:37.829 --> 00:15:37.839 align:start position:0%
to cut that back because let's get let's
 
00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
make sure we're focusing on priorities i
 
00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
don't want to over tax admin
 
00:15:43.829 --> 00:15:43.839 align:start position:0%
administrative services having to review
 
00:15:45.509 --> 00:15:45.519 align:start position:0%
and check 900 billion dollars of
 
00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
projects when we know we're looking at
 
00:15:48.949 --> 00:15:48.959 align:start position:0%
about if you add in all the highway and
 
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
other money and federal money that might
 
00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:52.720 align:start position:0%
come in maybe 300 million dollars a
 
00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
project something like that maybe 150 to
 
00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
300 million so i've really asked the
 
00:15:59.590 --> 00:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
agencies to to cut back what their
 
00:16:01.509 --> 00:16:01.519 align:start position:0%
requests are what their presentations
 
00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
are so that the legislature can and
 
00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
admin services and our teams can really
 
00:16:07.829 --> 00:16:07.839 align:start position:0%
focus on the highest needs the highest
 
00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
priorities and just be much more
 
00:16:10.949 --> 00:16:10.959 align:start position:0%
efficient i think as we go through the
 
00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
the entire process
 
00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
um okay with that i think we'll we'll
 
00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
open it up to uh and i'll i'm gonna just
 
00:16:19.829 --> 00:16:19.839 align:start position:0%
for uh
 
00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
for everyone's
 
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
the fyi is i'll be here for the first
 
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
presentation uh with the university
 
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
system and then i do have to step out
 
00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
for other meetings uh james gary will be
 
00:16:29.829 --> 00:16:29.839 align:start position:0%
here our new budget director uh within
 
00:16:31.189 --> 00:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
my office james comes from the
 
00:16:33.269 --> 00:16:33.279 align:start position:0%
department of revenue administration and
 
00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:34.720 align:start position:0%
when it comes to financial stuff he's
 
00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:36.320 align:start position:0%
wicked smart as we say here in new
 
00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:37.749 align:start position:0%
wicked smart as we say here in new
hampshire

00:16:37.749 --> 00:16:37.759 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:16:39.269 --> 00:16:39.279 align:start position:0%
so with that we'll kick it off with the
 
00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:49.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
good morning governor and

university system
 
00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:03.680 align:start position:0%
glad to be here this morning president
 
00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
jim dean of unh and current interim

chancellor sends his regrets he is
 
00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:10.079 align:start position:0%
traveling back to new hampshire today
 
00:17:12.549 --> 00:17:12.559 align:start position:0%
from a long planned vacation um he would
 
00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
have been here
 
00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:16.160 align:start position:0%
were it not for that there is material
 
00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:18.720 align:start position:0%
we've i've put together a handful of
 
00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
slides i'm not going to walk through all
 
00:17:22.949 --> 00:17:22.959 align:start position:0%
of these slides i just want to hit some
 
00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
high points
 
00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:25.429 align:start position:0%
high points
so

00:17:25.429 --> 00:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:17:27.429 --> 00:17:27.439 align:start position:0%
as the governor mentioned during his
 
00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
opening remarks on slide 2 back in 2019
 
00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
the capital budget that was
 
00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
adopted provided for three biennium of
 
00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:39.029 align:start position:0%
adopted provided for three biennium of
capital

00:17:39.029 --> 00:17:39.039 align:start position:0%
capital
 
00:17:40.549 --> 00:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
funds for
 
00:17:42.789 --> 00:17:42.799 align:start position:0%
university system projects fiscal years
 
00:17:46.549 --> 00:17:46.559 align:start position:0%
24 and 25 is that third biennium and we
 
00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:51.029 --> 00:17:51.039 align:start position:0%
that stay intact
 
00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
we aren't asking for anything more
 
00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
obviously but ask that that stay in tax
 
00:17:58.310 --> 00:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
i'll talk in a minute about back in 2019
 
00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
the university system committed
 
00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:02.720 align:start position:0%
that any overages the university system
 
00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
would cover we weren't going to come
 
00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
back to the state for additional funds
 
00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
and so for 2 fiscal years 24 and 25 at
 
00:18:15.029 --> 00:18:15.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
you can see on slide four
 
00:18:19.909 --> 00:18:19.919 align:start position:0%
in the shaded column
 
00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
the 17 million dollars
 
00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:24.320 align:start position:0%
will be allocated to the biological
 
00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:25.510 align:start position:0%
will be allocated to the biological
sciences

00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
sciences
 
00:18:27.669 --> 00:18:27.679 align:start position:0%
initiative at unh i'll talk in a bit
 
00:18:29.029 --> 00:18:29.039 align:start position:0%
about that
 
00:18:31.029 --> 00:18:31.039 align:start position:0%
hyde hall at plymouth state and elliott
 
00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
and joslin halls at keene state just as
 
00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
outlined in the 19 2019 capital budget
 
00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:39.270 align:start position:0%
outlined in the 19 2019 capital budget
law

00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
on slide five
 
00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
i just want to give
 
00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
an an
 
00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:46.240 align:start position:0%
overall look of where the funding comes
 
00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
from for the university systems capital
 
00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:49.510 align:start position:0%
from for the university systems capital
program

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:52.160 align:start position:0%
we generally target to spend
 
00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:54.400 align:start position:0%
one times depreciation
 
00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
every year on our capital total capital
 
00:18:59.510 --> 00:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
program so we're doing the best we can
 
00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
to keep up with deferred maintenance
 
00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
so we've spent over the past six years
 
00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:05.160 align:start position:0%
we've spent
 
00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
447 million dollars on our capital
 
00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:08.630 align:start position:0%
447 million dollars on our capital
program

00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:10.160 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of that from
 
00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
university system funds the state funds
 
00:19:16.549 --> 00:19:16.559 align:start position:0%
help enormously in in our overall
 
00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
capital program our new debt
 
00:19:21.909 --> 00:19:21.919 align:start position:0%
has amounted to about seven percent and
 
00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
just um for folks information
 
00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
the university system is authorized by
 
00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
law to issue debt for what we call
 
00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:31.590 align:start position:0%
law to issue debt for what we call
self-supporting

00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
self-supporting
 
00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:32.870 align:start position:0%
self-supporting
structures

00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
structures
 
00:19:35.669 --> 00:19:35.679 align:start position:0%
res halls dining halls we do not have
 
00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
statutory authority and do not borrow or
 
00:19:40.789 --> 00:19:40.799 align:start position:0%
issue debt for academic buildings and
 
00:19:42.789 --> 00:19:42.799 align:start position:0%
that's why the programs that
 
00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:44.720 align:start position:0%
the projects that
 
00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:46.640 align:start position:0%
we've requested state funds for are
 
00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
solely academic programs
 
00:19:52.789 --> 00:19:52.799 align:start position:0%
on um slide seven it's the
 
00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
status if you will of where we are on
 
00:19:57.909 --> 00:19:57.919 align:start position:0%
the unh biological sciences initiative
 
00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
this project will eliminate about 30
 
00:20:02.149 --> 00:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
million dollars in deferred maintenance
 
00:20:04.549 --> 00:20:04.559 align:start position:0%
it's a complete renovation of spaulding
 
00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:06.640 align:start position:0%
hall which is i think was built in the
 
00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
70s and in addition
 
00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:10.149 align:start position:0%
70s and in addition
um

00:20:10.149 --> 00:20:10.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
we're we're putting an addition on to
 
00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
spalding hall
 
00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:16.240 align:start position:0%
with the renovation
 
00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
let me just it's a 95 million dollar
 
00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
project it's the largest project the
 
00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
university system has ever undertaken
 
00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
the state has supported 35 million of
 
00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
that project in the university system
 
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
is funding the other 60 million
 
00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:34.720 align:start position:0%
on slide nine
 
00:20:36.149 --> 00:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
you can see where we are in the
 
00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
different phases
 
00:20:41.029 --> 00:20:41.039 align:start position:0%
we've completed phase one that was the
 
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
renovation it was completed in april
 
00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
faculty and staff are already occupying
 
00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
that space and phase two began this
 
00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
month and of note we have a guaranteed
 
00:20:53.669 --> 00:20:53.679 align:start position:0%
maximum price that was signed off in
 
00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
january of 21 so we know what the price
 
00:20:58.950 --> 00:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
of the project is
 
00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
i'd also offer if anyone's ever
 
00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
interested in taking a tour of the
 
00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:04.230 align:start position:0%
interested in taking a tour of the
facility

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:04.240 align:start position:0%
facility
 
00:21:06.149 --> 00:21:06.159 align:start position:0%
always happy to arrange that if folks
 
00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to come over and and see where
 
00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
the dollars are going
 
00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:13.120 align:start position:0%
the um i'm now going to just skip
 
00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
quickly in the interest of time
 
00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
slide 13 hyde hall at plymouth state
 
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.390 align:start position:0%
slide 13 hyde hall at plymouth state
university

00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
university
 
00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:22.480 align:start position:0%
this project will eliminate 17 million
 
00:21:24.549 --> 00:21:24.559 align:start position:0%
dollars in deferred maintenance hyde
 
00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
hall is the most used academic space on
 
00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
the plymouth state campus
 
00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
and the business program is in that
 
00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:33.110 align:start position:0%
and the business program is in that
facility

00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
facility
 
00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
and so that it's one of our top needs at
 
00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
plymouth state
 
00:21:39.909 --> 00:21:39.919 align:start position:0%
that project we're well into planning
 
00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
construction has not yet begun and then
 
00:21:46.789 --> 00:21:46.799 align:start position:0%
at keene state on slide 17
 
00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
elliott hall and joslin hall again
 
00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:50.720 align:start position:0%
a lot of deferred maintenance needs in
 
00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
those in those buildings
 
00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
the vision here is to
 
00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
turn elliot hall into a student success
 
00:21:58.870 --> 00:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
center so you have one-stop shopping
 
00:22:00.549 --> 00:22:00.559 align:start position:0%
from admissions to graduation for
 
00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:02.720 align:start position:0%
retention issues
 
00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:05.200 align:start position:0%
and career services everything in one
 
00:22:07.669 --> 00:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
space for our students
 
00:22:07.679 --> 00:22:08.789 align:start position:0%
space for our students
i

00:22:08.789 --> 00:22:08.799 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:22:10.789 --> 00:22:10.799 align:start position:0%
went through that quickly but in the
 
00:22:12.549 --> 00:22:12.559 align:start position:0%
interest of time i wanted to make sure
 
00:22:14.789 --> 00:22:14.799 align:start position:0%
that we provide i provided you with
 
00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:17.200 align:start position:0%
enough time to ask questions and as
 
00:22:19.029 --> 00:22:19.039 align:start position:0%
always if you ever have any follow-up
 
00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
questions or slide at the very end has
 
00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
my contact as well as tom cronin's
 
00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
thomas with me this morning he's the
 
00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
director of government relations and you
 
00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
can reach out anytime with follow-up
 
00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:31.990 align:start position:0%
can reach out anytime with follow-up
questions

00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:22:34.149 --> 00:22:34.159 align:start position:0%
great thank you i appreciate that we'll
 
00:22:40.149 --> 00:22:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
thank you governor
 
00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
kathy um
 
00:22:45.669 --> 00:22:45.679 align:start position:0%
we've been around this block several
 
00:22:45.679 --> 00:22:47.909 align:start position:0%
we've been around this block several
times

00:22:47.909 --> 00:22:47.919 align:start position:0%
times
 
00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
you're not going to come in and ask for
 
00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
anything more for this next biennium or
 
00:22:59.750 --> 00:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:01.029 --> 00:23:01.039 align:start position:0%
i just want you to talk a little bit
 
00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
about the
 
00:23:05.909 --> 00:23:05.919 align:start position:0%
competitive status of unh and how these
 
00:23:07.669 --> 00:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
projects may help
 
00:23:07.679 --> 00:23:09.350 align:start position:0%
projects may help
to

00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
add to your competitive status in
 
00:23:12.789 --> 00:23:12.799 align:start position:0%
attracting students in this environment
 
00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
that we're in today thank you for the
 
00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:16.240 align:start position:0%
question um
 
00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
this biological sciences initiative is
 
00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
an imperative
 
00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:22.400 align:start position:0%
to ensure that we remain competitive
 
00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:24.400 align:start position:0%
especially with flagships around new
 
00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
england and those are the top
 
00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
competitors for unh
 
00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
uvm umass uconn they've all
 
00:23:34.149 --> 00:23:34.159 align:start position:0%
recently updated their life sciences
 
00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
facilities because there's such a need
 
00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
in the workforce so it really is an
 
00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
imperative and a top priority for the
 
00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
university system which is why the state
 
00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
support has been so
 
00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:47.029 align:start position:0%
support has been so
instrumental

00:23:47.029 --> 00:23:47.039 align:start position:0%
instrumental
 
00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:53.269 --> 00:23:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
um all right do you have any concerns uh
 
00:23:58.710 --> 00:23:58.720 align:start position:0%
given the current economic situation
 
00:24:01.029 --> 00:24:01.039 align:start position:0%
that the country is in with
 
00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh price escalations for projects that
 
00:24:06.149 --> 00:24:06.159 align:start position:0%
sort of a thing
 
00:24:06.159 --> 00:24:07.350 align:start position:0%
sort of a thing
absolutely

00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:07.360 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
00:24:09.029 --> 00:24:09.039 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely i can tell you again on
 
00:24:11.269 --> 00:24:11.279 align:start position:0%
the biological sciences initiative
 
00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
we've signed off
 
00:24:16.149 --> 00:24:16.159 align:start position:0%
more than a year ago on the guaranteed
 
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
maximum price with the construction
 
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
manager at risk that's why we chose to
 
00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
use a construction manager at risk
 
00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:27.200 align:start position:0%
methodology for that building um but yes
 
00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
what's happening is
 
00:24:30.149 --> 00:24:30.159 align:start position:0%
just as the governor mentioned at the
 
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
state level
 
00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:34.240 align:start position:0%
with our overall capital program
 
00:24:36.789 --> 00:24:36.799 align:start position:0%
we have to really prioritize
 
00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
when we're looking at spending 65
 
00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
million dollars our one times
 
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.510 align:start position:0%
million dollars our one times
depreciation

00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
depreciation
 
00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
we're going through the same
 
00:24:45.909 --> 00:24:45.919 align:start position:0%
process right now across the university
 
00:24:47.909 --> 00:24:47.919 align:start position:0%
system on what are the top priorities
 
00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
because of that escalation
 
00:24:53.029 --> 00:24:53.039 align:start position:0%
so so you don't expect any other ask
 
00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
even though
 
00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
of the state
 
00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:56.789 align:start position:0%
of the state
yes

00:24:56.789 --> 00:24:56.799 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:24:56.799 --> 00:24:58.310 align:start position:0%
yes
no

00:24:58.310 --> 00:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:25:01.909 --> 00:25:01.919 align:start position:0%
okay thank you not in the capital budget
 
00:25:01.919 --> 00:25:02.390 align:start position:0%
okay thank you not in the capital budget
no

00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:04.070 align:start position:0%
no
[Laughter]

00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:05.200 align:start position:0%
we'll get to the other budget don't
 
00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
worry we'll get there
 
00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
i i the question i would have is uh
 
00:25:11.269 --> 00:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
timing i mean i believe construction has
 
00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
already begun in the initial phase right
 
00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:16.240 align:start position:0%
correct biological sign phase one is
 
00:25:18.549 --> 00:25:18.559 align:start position:0%
complete right the addition is complete
 
00:25:21.029 --> 00:25:21.039 align:start position:0%
and phase two the renovation
 
00:25:22.549 --> 00:25:22.559 align:start position:0%
started this month
 
00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
so it got underway yeah and i know
 
00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
covert obviously threw a wrench into the
 
00:25:27.909 --> 00:25:27.919 align:start position:0%
timing on a lot of this you guys did it
 
00:25:27.919 --> 00:25:28.630 align:start position:0%
timing on a lot of this you guys did it
i

00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
i'll just say you did a phenomenal job
 
00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
getting the nursing center open that was
 
00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:33.200 align:start position:0%
the expansion there was just unbelie i
 
00:25:34.549 --> 00:25:34.559 align:start position:0%
was shocked when they said you were
 
00:25:36.149 --> 00:25:36.159 align:start position:0%
cutting ribbons i i couldn't believe it
 
00:25:38.149 --> 00:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
uh so kova i definitely threw a wrench
 
00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:40.240 align:start position:0%
in a lot of different things um is your
 
00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:42.400 align:start position:0%
overall schedule off by a bit
 
00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
on the biological it would be expected
 
00:25:46.789 --> 00:25:46.799 align:start position:0%
but i didn't know we expect the entire
 
00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
project will be completed in may of 24.
 
00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
okay we did have we pulled back for
 
00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
about six months honestly because
 
00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:56.320 align:start position:0%
of our own cash flow we didn't know what
 
00:25:57.909 --> 00:25:57.919 align:start position:0%
to expect during covet at the very
 
00:25:59.269 --> 00:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
beginning so we pulled back on our
 
00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
capital program so i would say we're
 
00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
probably six months off from what we
 
00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:05.360 align:start position:0%
thought it was going to be six years ago
 
00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
well that's not too bad okay given
 
00:26:08.149 --> 00:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
everything we've gone through from the
 
00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
okay great well thank you guys very much
 
00:26:15.029 --> 00:26:15.039 align:start position:0%
i really appreciate it and thanks for
 
00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:16.400 align:start position:0%
coming for definitely kicking us off on
 
00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
the right foot
 
00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
uh with that i'm going to we're going to
 
00:26:22.789 --> 00:26:22.799 align:start position:0%
bring up well let's take
 
00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
should we just keep plowing through um
 
00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
they're here we we actually can't start
 
00:26:29.909 --> 00:26:29.919 align:start position:0%
until the time on the schedule oh oh yep
 
00:26:31.029 --> 00:26:31.039 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:26:32.149 --> 00:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
we're three minutes is that is that
 
00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
clock right i don't know
 
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
okay great so we have four minutes and
 
00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
then i will come up and torture the
 
00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
department of energy a little bit so
 
00:26:42.149 --> 00:26:42.159 align:start position:0%
thank you guys very much we'll take a
 
00:28:57.830 --> 00:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:58.070 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
okay it is now 9 30
 
00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
and would like to call the department of
 
00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:12.230 align:start position:0%
and would like to call the department of
energy

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:13.029 align:start position:0%
 
hey

just
 
00:30:16.149 --> 00:30:16.159 align:start position:0%
give a minute for people to
 
00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:43.909 --> 00:30:43.919 align:start position:0%

00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:46.240 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is jared chocoin
 
00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:47.200 align:start position:0%
and i'm the commissioner of the
 
00:30:48.870 --> 00:30:48.880 align:start position:0%
department of energy thank you for the
 
00:30:50.789 --> 00:30:50.799 align:start position:0%
opportunity to present our our capital
 
00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
budget request
 
00:30:54.549 --> 00:30:54.559 align:start position:0%
the department administers the federal
 
00:30:56.149 --> 00:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
low-income home energy assistance
 
00:30:58.389 --> 00:30:58.399 align:start position:0%
program and the federal weatherization
 
00:30:59.909 --> 00:30:59.919 align:start position:0%
assistance program
 
00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
for both programs the department
 
00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
contracts with the five community action
 
00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
agencies to process applications and pay
 
00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:08.240 align:start position:0%
vendors and contractors for both
 
00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:09.669 align:start position:0%
vendors and contractors for both
programs

00:31:09.669 --> 00:31:09.679 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:31:11.029 --> 00:31:11.039 align:start position:0%
currently the software that the
 
00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
community action agencies use to process
 
00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:14.950 align:start position:0%
community action agencies use to process
applications

00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
applications
 
00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:17.200 align:start position:0%
and run reports for both programs is
 
00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:18.389 align:start position:0%
and run reports for both programs is
outdated

00:31:18.389 --> 00:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
outdated
 
00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
insufficient for federal rep reporting
 
00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
and not very nimble when changes need to
 
00:31:24.549 --> 00:31:24.559 align:start position:0%
be made
 
00:31:26.789 --> 00:31:26.799 align:start position:0%
the software no longer meets the demands
 
00:31:29.029 --> 00:31:29.039 align:start position:0%
of these very large programs
 
00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
using these federal funds the department
 
00:31:32.549 --> 00:31:32.559 align:start position:0%
will purchase new software that will
 
00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
gain considerable administrative
 
00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
efficiencies for these important
 
00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:38.320 align:start position:0%
assistance programs um
 
00:31:40.549 --> 00:31:40.559 align:start position:0%
and uh i can tell you from our
 
00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
experience over the last year or so it's
 
00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
it's very much needed
 
00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
with that i'd be happy to answer any
 
00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:54.389 --> 00:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
a quick question
 
00:31:56.549 --> 00:31:56.559 align:start position:0%
given the importance of this program
 
00:31:58.789 --> 00:31:58.799 align:start position:0%
given what's been happening to energy
 
00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
rates how are you situated for the next
 
00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
year or so until this this money can get
 
00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:07.360 align:start position:0%
to you sure great question thank you um
 
00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:09.440 align:start position:0%
we have an action plan in place for this
 
00:32:10.549 --> 00:32:10.559 align:start position:0%
coming fall
 
00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
we've been working with the caps earlier
 
00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:14.720 align:start position:0%
than we typically would on making sure
 
00:32:16.389 --> 00:32:16.399 align:start position:0%
that the system is going to be able to
 
00:32:19.509 --> 00:32:19.519 align:start position:0%
handle um the needs of this fall
 
00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
one issue that we ran into last year
 
00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:24.640 align:start position:0%
was we we increased the benefit
 
00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
um pretty substantially in the fuel
 
00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:29.440 align:start position:0%
assistance program and as a result of
 
00:32:30.549 --> 00:32:30.559 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
00:32:32.389 --> 00:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
make that change in the software we
 
00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
encountered a number of
 
00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
obstacles so we're starting earlier this
 
00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
year to make sure we can address those
 
00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
i was uh looking at the summary item and
 
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
i noticed this is both for fap and for
 
00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
whap and i'm gathering that you can use
 
00:32:51.509 --> 00:32:51.519 align:start position:0%
it for fap and wap and that will help
 
00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:53.200 align:start position:0%
you interface with the cap
 
00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:53.990 align:start position:0%
you interface with the cap
yes

00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:32:54.000 --> 00:33:00.470 align:start position:0%
yes
good

00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunately i understood what the
 
00:33:09.269 --> 00:33:09.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
in your summary you also talk and i
 
00:33:13.029 --> 00:33:13.039 align:start position:0%
remember that we provided
 
00:33:15.669 --> 00:33:15.679 align:start position:0%
um some funds for the replacements
 
00:33:18.549 --> 00:33:18.559 align:start position:0%
software in a previous capital budget
 
00:33:18.559 --> 00:33:19.590 align:start position:0%
software in a previous capital budget
um

00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
what are your intentions with that money
 
00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
just to let it lapse or what
 
00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
so we're asking for a lap extension
 
00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
of the 316 000 from the last budget into
 
00:33:33.310 --> 00:33:33.320 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
2425 biennium
 
00:33:37.509 --> 00:33:37.519 align:start position:0%
to be used on this same project
 
00:33:39.669 --> 00:33:39.679 align:start position:0%
absolutely yes okay so the total amount
 
00:33:41.509 --> 00:33:41.519 align:start position:0%
will be much more than what is shown
 
00:33:48.389 --> 00:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner chacoin thanks for bringing
 
00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:52.720 align:start position:0%
this project forward just for the for
 
00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
the edification of the committee uh
 
00:33:56.789 --> 00:33:56.799 align:start position:0%
one of the first meetings i had with a
 
00:33:59.750 --> 00:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
head of agency back in 2015 when i
 
00:34:01.029 --> 00:34:01.039 align:start position:0%
joined was
 
00:34:04.549 --> 00:34:04.559 align:start position:0%
what was before osi and they were
 
00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
talking about the need to replace this
 
00:34:09.669 --> 00:34:09.679 align:start position:0%
system over seven years ago so um thanks
 
00:34:11.109 --> 00:34:11.119 align:start position:0%
for bringing this forward it is it is
 
00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
much needed and i'm glad that it's
 
00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:14.720 align:start position:0%
happening now and

00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
the commissioner for the department of
 
00:44:58.390 --> 00:44:58.400 align:start position:0%
information technology
 
00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:00.160 align:start position:0%
we have three requests to talk about
 
00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
today the first
 
00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:03.190 align:start position:0%
today the first
is

00:45:03.190 --> 00:45:03.200 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
on page two and it's our cyber security
 
00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
once again we have cyber security needs
 
00:45:10.550 --> 00:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
um and i and uh
 
00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
uh normally when you look at this slide
 
00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
you're you're probably thinking wow
 
00:45:16.390 --> 00:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
there's a bunch of geek speak on here
 
00:45:18.790 --> 00:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
that that isn't very comprehensible and
 
00:45:21.030 --> 00:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
normally we try to avoid that but in
 
00:45:23.109 --> 00:45:23.119 align:start position:0%
this case we did it because it's
 
00:45:25.589 --> 00:45:25.599 align:start position:0%
you know if you were interested in um
 
00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
these are very common uh terminologies
 
00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
that are used in the industry right now
 
00:45:31.109 --> 00:45:31.119 align:start position:0%
and if you were interested in
 
00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
researching any of this that you'd find
 
00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
it under this terminology and you know
 
00:45:37.349 --> 00:45:37.359 align:start position:0%
on the internet but i will break it down
 
00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
for you in a way that's that's a bit
 
00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
more comprehensible um
 
00:45:44.309 --> 00:45:44.319 align:start position:0%
basically um the way we look at cyber
 
00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:46.480 align:start position:0%
managing cyber security is in terms of
 
00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:48.390 align:start position:0%
managing cyber security is in terms of
events

00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
events
 
00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
processes millions of events per month
 
00:45:56.069 --> 00:45:56.079 align:start position:0%
thankfully most of which are minor or
 
00:45:57.910 --> 00:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
that we handle right away i'll give you
 
00:46:00.309 --> 00:46:00.319 align:start position:0%
some examples of what an event could be
 
00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:02.960 align:start position:0%
an event could be you know a bad actor
 
00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:06.640 align:start position:0%
in a foreign country or nation state who
 
00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
attempts to get into our network and
 
00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:10.150 align:start position:0%
attempts to get into our network and
fails

00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:10.160 align:start position:0%
fails
 
00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
an event could be a
 
00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:14.480 align:start position:0%
failed login attempt on a critical
 
00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:16.309 align:start position:0%
failed login attempt on a critical
system

00:46:16.309 --> 00:46:16.319 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:46:18.790 --> 00:46:18.800 align:start position:0%
an event could be a successful
 
00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
ransomware ransom of a pc in our
 
00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.190 align:start position:0%
ransomware ransom of a pc in our
environment

00:46:23.190 --> 00:46:23.200 align:start position:0%
environment
 
00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
an event could be an email
 
00:46:28.230 --> 00:46:28.240 align:start position:0%
that successfully makes it through to an
 
00:46:31.109 --> 00:46:31.119 align:start position:0%
inbox that has either malware in it or a
 
00:46:32.950 --> 00:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
link to malware that could potentially
 
00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:34.960 align:start position:0%
ransom the state and so we're dealing
 
00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
with millions and millions of these
 
00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:37.670 align:start position:0%
with millions and millions of these
events

00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
events
 
00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:38.470 align:start position:0%
events
so

00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
one of the things that has to happen is
 
00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
your event management capability your
 
00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:45.510 align:start position:0%
your event management capability your
s-i-e-m

00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
s-i-e-m
 
00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:46.950 align:start position:0%
s-i-e-m
capability

00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:46.960 align:start position:0%
capability
 
00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
needs to needs to continually get better
 
00:46:51.829 --> 00:46:51.839 align:start position:0%
so that's an area that a gap that we've
 
00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
identified recently and
 
00:46:56.230 --> 00:46:56.240 align:start position:0%
you know are desiring to work on the the
 
00:46:58.710 --> 00:46:58.720 align:start position:0%
other thing that's going on now is that
 
00:47:01.670 --> 00:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
our our enemies whether they be foreign
 
00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:02.950 align:start position:0%
our our enemies whether they be foreign
actors

00:47:02.950 --> 00:47:02.960 align:start position:0%
actors
 
00:47:05.430 --> 00:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
um or uh with um
 
00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
with malicious intent or commercial
 
00:47:09.670 --> 00:47:09.680 align:start position:0%
actors with ie trying to extract money
 
00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:12.160 align:start position:0%
with malicious intent are increasingly
 
00:47:14.230 --> 00:47:14.240 align:start position:0%
using um
 
00:47:16.069 --> 00:47:16.079 align:start position:0%
ai technology
 
00:47:16.079 --> 00:47:17.430 align:start position:0%
ai technology
to

00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
figure out where the vulnerabilities are
 
00:47:21.270 --> 00:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
so it's not just a human on the end of a
 
00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
computer looking at things anymore it's
 
00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
that automated intelligence that's
 
00:47:27.430 --> 00:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
seeking to find where vulnerabilities
 
00:47:29.190 --> 00:47:29.200 align:start position:0%
are in the state network and exploit
 
00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:29.910 align:start position:0%
are in the state network and exploit
them

00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:47:31.829 --> 00:47:31.839 align:start position:0%
and you know one really good example is
 
00:47:34.790 --> 00:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
um you know some companies will you know
 
00:47:36.870 --> 00:47:36.880 align:start position:0%
put up a vulnerable server on the
 
00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
outside of their network just to see
 
00:47:40.309 --> 00:47:40.319 align:start position:0%
what happens with nothing important on
 
00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
it and typically
 
00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
in less than 20 minutes
 
00:47:46.950 --> 00:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
if you put one up in less than 20
 
00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:48.790 align:start position:0%
if you put one up in less than 20
minutes

00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
00:47:50.549 --> 00:47:50.559 align:start position:0%
bad actors will find it and begin to
 
00:47:52.950 --> 00:47:52.960 align:start position:0%
exploit it so that's how effective they
 
00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
are at at getting to this stuff so two
 
00:47:57.270 --> 00:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
things we you know in that area what we
 
00:47:59.109 --> 00:47:59.119 align:start position:0%
want to do is we want to get better at
 
00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
managing these millions millions of
 
00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
events using
 
00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:03.750 align:start position:0%
events using
this

00:48:03.750 --> 00:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
automated response technology
 
00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
and and also get better at
 
00:48:10.549 --> 00:48:10.559 align:start position:0%
figuring out which ones we should be
 
00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
paying attention to and not
 
00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
the second current state bullet identity
 
00:48:17.910 --> 00:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
and access management that is simple
 
00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
it's i'm logging into a system
 
00:48:22.870 --> 00:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
and can i do i get in there or not am i
 
00:48:25.349 --> 00:48:25.359 align:start position:0%
the really dennis goulet and am i really
 
00:48:27.990 --> 00:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
authorized to do those things um so one
 
00:48:29.109 --> 00:48:29.119 align:start position:0%
of the things that's come out since
 
00:48:31.109 --> 00:48:31.119 align:start position:0%
since the advent of ransomware and i
 
00:48:33.109 --> 00:48:33.119 align:start position:0%
want to just take a a little detour here
 
00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
on ransomware for a moment um in in the
 
00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
old days of cyber security it used to be
 
00:48:40.069 --> 00:48:40.079 align:start position:0%
oh we were worried about exfiltration of
 
00:48:43.349 --> 00:48:43.359 align:start position:0%
information like personal information or
 
00:48:45.750 --> 00:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
um no credit card information or social
 
00:48:47.829 --> 00:48:47.839 align:start position:0%
security numbers well that's still very
 
00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
important we don't want bad actors to be
 
00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
stealing that information but it's much
 
00:48:53.190 --> 00:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
worse now because
 
00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:54.150 align:start position:0%
worse now because
um

00:48:54.150 --> 00:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:57.030 --> 00:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
with the event of ransomware now um the
 
00:48:59.430 --> 00:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
continuity of government can be affected
 
00:49:01.990 --> 00:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
um so you know if it's a critical system
 
00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
gets ransomed it's no longer providing
 
00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
the citizen services that we stood it up
 
00:49:09.109 --> 00:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
for so the importance there is is
 
00:49:09.119 --> 00:49:10.309 align:start position:0%
for so the importance there is is
greater

00:49:10.309 --> 00:49:10.319 align:start position:0%
greater
 
00:49:12.549 --> 00:49:12.559 align:start position:0%
in what's become kind of the gold
 
00:49:14.150 --> 00:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
standard for protecting there's a bunch
 
00:49:15.349 --> 00:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
of different things you can do to
 
00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
protect from ransomware but one of the
 
00:49:18.790 --> 00:49:18.800 align:start position:0%
gold standards is
 
00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
strong identity and access management so
 
00:49:23.109 --> 00:49:23.119 align:start position:0%
and in particular multi-factor
 
00:49:24.790 --> 00:49:24.800 align:start position:0%
authentication so that's an area where
 
00:49:27.990 --> 00:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
we're working hard to have both improve
 
00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
our our profile around the executive
 
00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
branch as well as
 
00:49:34.549 --> 00:49:34.559 align:start position:0%
make it consistent so that we know that
 
00:49:36.630 --> 00:49:36.640 align:start position:0%
all of our critical systems and the and
 
00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
the pcs because a pc is a critical
 
00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
system typically
 
00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
the way a successful large-scale
 
00:49:45.109 --> 00:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
ransomware attack
 
00:49:47.670 --> 00:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
starts is on an individual's device
 
00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
whether it's a phone or a pc or a tablet
 
00:49:53.829 --> 00:49:53.839 align:start position:0%
the last thing i would say is
 
00:49:56.309 --> 00:49:56.319 align:start position:0%
the national institutes of standards and
 
00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
technology nist continues to evolve its
 
00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
its standards as it relates to cyber
 
00:50:04.870 --> 00:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
security so we're always
 
00:50:06.390 --> 00:50:06.400 align:start position:0%
trying to keep up
 
00:50:08.390 --> 00:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
with that and so that's really what that
 
00:50:10.390 --> 00:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
third bullet means and without going to
 
00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
the desired end state through that for
 
00:50:14.309 --> 00:50:14.319 align:start position:0%
you in specifics really what we're
 
00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:16.160 align:start position:0%
trying to do is address those three
 
00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
areas and improve our profile
 
00:50:22.309 --> 00:50:22.319 align:start position:0%
with respect to those i'll i'll stop on
 
00:50:24.390 --> 00:50:24.400 align:start position:0%
uh here for questions on cyber security
 
00:50:31.109 --> 00:50:31.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:33.200 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner
 
00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
assuming you you receive that amount of
 
00:50:38.790 --> 00:50:38.800 align:start position:0%
money or somewhere in there to do the
 
00:50:41.430 --> 00:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
the program enhancements would they all
 
00:50:44.470 --> 00:50:44.480 align:start position:0%
be done in one biennium
 
00:50:47.670 --> 00:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
or are we talking spreading it out over
 
00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
a couple
 
00:50:51.990 --> 00:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
um what we've seen typically in the
 
00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
recent i'd
 
00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
i'll admit we've been asking for cyber
 
00:50:57.990 --> 00:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
security money every biennium since i've
 
00:50:59.829 --> 00:50:59.839 align:start position:0%
been here and i think before
 
00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
and that's the sad state of things in
 
00:51:03.510 --> 00:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
cyber security we have been
 
00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:05.270 align:start position:0%
cyber security we have been
operationalizing

00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
operationalizing
 
00:51:08.549 --> 00:51:08.559 align:start position:0%
most or all of what's been granted to us
 
00:51:10.549 --> 00:51:10.559 align:start position:0%
by the legislature each biennium and i
 
00:51:11.910 --> 00:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
would expect that to be true in this
 
00:51:15.990 --> 00:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
i have a question it relates to this and
 
00:51:21.510 --> 00:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:24.390 --> 00:51:24.400 align:start position:0%
the we we've all heard about uh
 
00:51:28.230 --> 00:51:28.240 align:start position:0%
chip shortages in it and the other
 
00:51:30.870 --> 00:51:30.880 align:start position:0%
supply chain issues which have
 
00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:32.230 align:start position:0%
supply chain issues which have
impacted

00:51:32.230 --> 00:51:32.240 align:start position:0%
impacted
 
00:51:34.790 --> 00:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
this industry are there any supply chain
 
00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
issues that you're aware of which would
 
00:51:39.430 --> 00:51:39.440 align:start position:0%
either delay or hinder
 
00:51:40.870 --> 00:51:40.880 align:start position:0%
the projects that you're bringing before
 
00:51:41.990 --> 00:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
us today
 
00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:44.640 align:start position:0%
in in this case no we have some existing
 
00:51:47.670 --> 00:51:47.680 align:start position:0%
projects right now particularly our our
 
00:51:49.589 --> 00:51:49.599 align:start position:0%
arpa funded infrastructure enhancement
 
00:51:51.910 --> 00:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
project the network piece of that
 
00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
we got we got about three quarters of
 
00:51:56.309 --> 00:51:56.319 align:start position:0%
the equipment in pretty quickly and the
 
00:51:58.069 --> 00:51:58.079 align:start position:0%
other quarter is dribbling in really
 
00:52:00.069 --> 00:52:00.079 align:start position:0%
really slowly so that that did impact
 
00:52:02.549 --> 00:52:02.559 align:start position:0%
there but we're not actually buying
 
00:52:04.549 --> 00:52:04.559 align:start position:0%
physical things here with respect to
 
00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:06.800 align:start position:0%
this this would be licensing services
 
00:52:07.829 --> 00:52:07.839 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:52:09.510 --> 00:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
and implementing services so i wouldn't
 
00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
anticipate supply chain being a problem
 
00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
uh labor throughout the um there's a
 
00:52:17.270 --> 00:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
multiple statistics around the country
 
00:52:19.750 --> 00:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
but professional
 
00:52:21.750 --> 00:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
cyber security experts
 
00:52:23.510 --> 00:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
is a challenge in the industry so
 
00:52:25.349 --> 00:52:25.359 align:start position:0%
companies are are challenged with that
 
00:52:27.190 --> 00:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
states are challenged with that that's
 
00:52:32.309 --> 00:52:32.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:34.790 --> 00:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
good morning dennis this goes with this
 
00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
project but probably all three of them
 
00:52:39.109 --> 00:52:39.119 align:start position:0%
um if this isn't the purchase of
 
00:52:40.470 --> 00:52:40.480 align:start position:0%
software which it doesn't sound like
 
00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
it's more licensing or maybe in-house
 
00:52:44.710 --> 00:52:44.720 align:start position:0%
programming are you experiencing
 
00:52:46.870 --> 00:52:46.880 align:start position:0%
staffing resource issues or constraints
 
00:52:49.109 --> 00:52:49.119 align:start position:0%
yourself with these projects or as
 
00:52:50.790 --> 00:52:50.800 align:start position:0%
you're assisting other state agencies
 
00:52:51.750 --> 00:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
maybe you could just talk a little bit
 
00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
about where you stand with that yes um
 
00:52:56.069 --> 00:52:56.079 align:start position:0%
we uh thanks that's a really good
 
00:52:58.069 --> 00:52:58.079 align:start position:0%
question the um
 
00:53:00.549 --> 00:53:00.559 align:start position:0%
we are currently um you know have the
 
00:53:02.630 --> 00:53:02.640 align:start position:0%
highest level of vacancy that we've had
 
00:53:05.190 --> 00:53:05.200 align:start position:0%
um in doit um in the history of the
 
00:53:07.589 --> 00:53:07.599 align:start position:0%
department and i've checked because i
 
00:53:08.950 --> 00:53:08.960 align:start position:0%
i've been here seven years but even
 
00:53:10.470 --> 00:53:10.480 align:start position:0%
before that it's been a department's
 
00:53:12.069 --> 00:53:12.079 align:start position:0%
been around a while and i had my hr
 
00:53:13.910 --> 00:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
folks check and you know this is this is
 
00:53:14.950 --> 00:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
the highest
 
00:53:16.870 --> 00:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
um and in the industry you know we're
 
00:53:20.230 --> 00:53:20.240 align:start position:0%
all chasing after the same resources so
 
00:53:22.069 --> 00:53:22.079 align:start position:0%
it is a challenge but
 
00:53:24.309 --> 00:53:24.319 align:start position:0%
uh cyber security is one of those hot
 
00:53:25.990 --> 00:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
places where a lot of money is flowing
 
00:53:27.829 --> 00:53:27.839 align:start position:0%
in with venture capital monies for
 
00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
startup companies and they're paying
 
00:53:32.390 --> 00:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
extremely well
 
00:53:34.309 --> 00:53:34.319 align:start position:0%
so they are attracting the private
 
00:53:36.950 --> 00:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
sector is attracting uh talent pretty
 
00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
effectively that's not an area where
 
00:53:39.430 --> 00:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
we're having trouble there's certain
 
00:53:40.870 --> 00:53:40.880 align:start position:0%
other areas where we are but not in
 
00:53:44.950 --> 00:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:47.190 --> 00:53:47.200 align:start position:0%
okay like to continue i'll move on to
 
00:53:49.430 --> 00:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
the next one very quickly
 
00:53:51.589 --> 00:53:51.599 align:start position:0%
i want to try to keep us on our
 
00:53:52.870 --> 00:53:52.880 align:start position:0%
on schedule
 
00:53:55.750 --> 00:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
um financial systems modernization um
 
00:53:58.549 --> 00:53:58.559 align:start position:0%
you know we have a an old fine old kind
 
00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
of homegrown finance system that we've
 
00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
been running doit
 
00:54:04.230 --> 00:54:04.240 align:start position:0%
on for
 
00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
many many years now and since its
 
00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:07.589 align:start position:0%
many many years now and since its
formation

00:54:07.589 --> 00:54:07.599 align:start position:0%
formation
 
00:54:11.190 --> 00:54:11.200 align:start position:0%
it really is time to modernize that
 
00:54:13.190 --> 00:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of efficiency and
 
00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:15.349 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of efficiency and
transparency

00:54:15.349 --> 00:54:15.359 align:start position:0%
transparency
 
00:54:18.549 --> 00:54:18.559 align:start position:0%
in maturing our processes and also doing
 
00:54:20.470 --> 00:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
a better job of interoperating with our
 
00:54:22.150 --> 00:54:22.160 align:start position:0%
friends over at administrative services
 
00:54:24.790 --> 00:54:24.800 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire first so i won't go in
 
00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
too much uh detail on that but we'll be
 
00:54:28.870 --> 00:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
happy to um
 
00:54:30.950 --> 00:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
to field questions on that
 
00:54:33.190 --> 00:54:33.200 align:start position:0%
but it does i will say that you know we
 
00:54:35.030 --> 00:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
have staff that are retiring that know
 
00:54:37.430 --> 00:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
this old system and there's no way of
 
00:54:40.470 --> 00:54:40.480 align:start position:0%
hiring staff to to do the to do the old
 
00:54:42.309 --> 00:54:42.319 align:start position:0%
one but potentially for a new system
 
00:54:44.710 --> 00:54:44.720 align:start position:0%
that was out there we we could uh
 
00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:52.789 --> 00:54:52.799 align:start position:0%
bless you
 
00:54:54.710 --> 00:54:54.720 align:start position:0%
dennis as you're replacing this is there
 
00:54:57.349 --> 00:54:57.359 align:start position:0%
any opportunity to use the current new
 
00:54:58.950 --> 00:54:58.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire first for some of your
 
00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:00.390 align:start position:0%
hampshire first for some of your
activities

00:55:00.390 --> 00:55:00.400 align:start position:0%
activities
 
00:55:01.750 --> 00:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
yeah i think that would be a really
 
00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:02.950 align:start position:0%
yeah i think that would be a really
important

00:55:02.950 --> 00:55:02.960 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:55:04.470 --> 00:55:04.480 align:start position:0%
to me anyway that would be a really
 
00:55:07.109 --> 00:55:07.119 align:start position:0%
important part of how we approach this
 
00:55:09.750 --> 00:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
is we don't recreate the wheel so i i
 
00:55:12.150 --> 00:55:12.160 align:start position:0%
will commit to you that we're gonna
 
00:55:14.630 --> 00:55:14.640 align:start position:0%
look really hard at that and consult and
 
00:55:16.950 --> 00:55:16.960 align:start position:0%
collaborate with you folks to make sure
 
00:55:18.549 --> 00:55:18.559 align:start position:0%
that we're not doing that or creating
 
00:55:20.870 --> 00:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
downstream problems for you that were
 
00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:27.030 align:start position:0%
downstream problems for you that were
unanticipated

00:55:27.030 --> 00:55:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:29.829 --> 00:55:29.839 align:start position:0%
all right and finally and this
 
00:55:32.309 --> 00:55:32.319 align:start position:0%
question i'm sorry so um
 
00:55:34.950 --> 00:55:34.960 align:start position:0%
currently a homegrown system
 
00:55:36.390 --> 00:55:36.400 align:start position:0%
is this
 
00:55:40.230 --> 00:55:40.240 align:start position:0%
software that has already been produced
 
00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
and is in use
 
00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
throughout the country or throughout the
 
00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:44.950 align:start position:0%
throughout the country or throughout the
world

00:55:44.950 --> 00:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
world
 
00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:45.750 align:start position:0%
world
it's

00:55:45.750 --> 00:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:55:47.910 --> 00:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
produced and is in use in new hampshire
 
00:55:49.430 --> 00:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
in my department
 
00:55:51.910 --> 00:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
it's the homegrown correct right but i
 
00:55:53.910 --> 00:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
meant the replacements oh yes what we
 
00:55:56.309 --> 00:55:56.319 align:start position:0%
would do is we probably we would um
 
00:55:58.710 --> 00:55:58.720 align:start position:0%
do an rfi and find out what's a request
 
00:56:00.630 --> 00:56:00.640 align:start position:0%
for information we'd find out what's out
 
00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
there in the market we've already done
 
00:56:04.470 --> 00:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
some some of that so we kind of have an
 
00:56:06.069 --> 00:56:06.079 align:start position:0%
idea of what's out there
 
00:56:06.079 --> 00:56:07.670 align:start position:0%
idea of what's out there
and

00:56:07.670 --> 00:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:08.630 align:start position:0%
and
so

00:56:08.630 --> 00:56:08.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:10.240 align:start position:0%
we would be looking for common off the
 
00:56:11.910 --> 00:56:11.920 align:start position:0%
shelf software not something we would
 
00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
develop ourselves
 
00:56:17.670 --> 00:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:20.309 --> 00:56:20.319 align:start position:0%
all right finally um i.t service
 
00:56:22.390 --> 00:56:22.400 align:start position:0%
management is really the
 
00:56:25.109 --> 00:56:25.119 align:start position:0%
art and science of taking whatever
 
00:56:27.750 --> 00:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
resources we have and effectively
 
00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
applying them to the support of our
 
00:56:32.789 --> 00:56:32.799 align:start position:0%
customers which is the you know
 
00:56:34.789 --> 00:56:34.799 align:start position:0%
our final customers the citizens of new
 
00:56:37.270 --> 00:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire but the intermediate customer
 
00:56:39.349 --> 00:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
are our agency partners that we work
 
00:56:42.309 --> 00:56:42.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:44.069 --> 00:56:44.079 align:start position:0%
we've been running the same system for
 
00:56:46.789 --> 00:56:46.799 align:start position:0%
many years it's it's done an okay job of
 
00:56:48.630 --> 00:56:48.640 align:start position:0%
kind of transactional
 
00:56:50.710 --> 00:56:50.720 align:start position:0%
one-to-one um
 
00:56:52.710 --> 00:56:52.720 align:start position:0%
service management but
 
00:56:55.510 --> 00:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
but but the world has evolved past that
 
00:56:57.030 --> 00:56:57.040 align:start position:0%
and now there's a lot more
 
00:56:59.589 --> 00:56:59.599 align:start position:0%
sophistication in in the science and the
 
00:57:01.829 --> 00:57:01.839 align:start position:0%
measurement of how effective we are we
 
00:57:03.910 --> 00:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
don't have the ability to leverage that
 
00:57:05.589 --> 00:57:05.599 align:start position:0%
with the existing tools that we have
 
00:57:05.599 --> 00:57:06.870 align:start position:0%
with the existing tools that we have
today

00:57:06.870 --> 00:57:06.880 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:57:11.349 --> 00:57:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:13.589 --> 00:57:13.599 align:start position:0%
mature that over period of a couple
 
00:57:15.510 --> 00:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
biennia the first biennial would be
 
00:57:17.829 --> 00:57:17.839 align:start position:0%
analysis finding out what's out there
 
00:57:20.789 --> 00:57:20.799 align:start position:0%
how much it costs but also as we state
 
00:57:22.710 --> 00:57:22.720 align:start position:0%
in the um
 
00:57:23.589 --> 00:57:23.599 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:57:25.829 --> 00:57:25.839 align:start position:0%
report here that we would like to
 
00:57:28.390 --> 00:57:28.400 align:start position:0%
enhance the front end of it to improve
 
00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
uh the online services that we offer to
 
00:57:33.270 --> 00:57:33.280 align:start position:0%
the employees of the state to make them
 
00:57:36.069 --> 00:57:36.079 align:start position:0%
more efficient right now you can send in
 
00:57:38.069 --> 00:57:38.079 align:start position:0%
an email or you can call the help desk
 
00:57:38.079 --> 00:57:38.950 align:start position:0%
an email or you can call the help desk
but

00:57:38.950 --> 00:57:38.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:57:41.109 --> 00:57:41.119 align:start position:0%
i think automating and improving the
 
00:57:43.510 --> 00:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
services that we can offer online would
 
00:57:45.270 --> 00:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
improve services
 
00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
better leverage the pretty small staff
 
00:57:48.950 --> 00:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
we have who supports all of the
 
00:57:50.950 --> 00:57:50.960 align:start position:0%
executive branch employees
 
00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:51.990 align:start position:0%
executive branch employees
and

00:57:51.990 --> 00:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:57:55.190 --> 00:57:55.200 align:start position:0%
and and improve end service to the
 
00:57:57.270 --> 00:57:57.280 align:start position:0%
citizens through that efficiency that we
 
00:58:01.670 --> 00:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:03.589 --> 00:58:03.599 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
00:58:05.270 --> 00:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
thank you this is one of the ones i
 
00:58:06.630 --> 00:58:06.640 align:start position:0%
think the governor
 
00:58:08.789 --> 00:58:08.799 align:start position:0%
alluded to when he talked about spending
 
00:58:11.030 --> 00:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
money in one bietium
 
00:58:13.349 --> 00:58:13.359 align:start position:0%
and then um
 
00:58:16.230 --> 00:58:16.240 align:start position:0%
coming back for more
 
00:58:19.109 --> 00:58:19.119 align:start position:0%
if we only got the first phase
 
00:58:21.829 --> 00:58:21.839 align:start position:0%
what would happen
 
00:58:21.839 --> 00:58:22.710 align:start position:0%
what would happen
well

00:58:22.710 --> 00:58:22.720 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:58:24.470 --> 00:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
according to our plans the first phase
 
00:58:25.990 --> 00:58:26.000 align:start position:0%
would improve would would help us
 
00:58:27.910 --> 00:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
understand what it was going to cost we
 
00:58:29.349 --> 00:58:29.359 align:start position:0%
are already spending money on the
 
00:58:32.230 --> 00:58:32.240 align:start position:0%
existing system so it's it's not a full
 
00:58:33.510 --> 00:58:33.520 align:start position:0%
new new
 
00:58:34.789 --> 00:58:34.799 align:start position:0%
um although
 
00:58:34.799 --> 00:58:35.670 align:start position:0%
um although
the

00:58:35.670 --> 00:58:35.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:58:38.150 --> 00:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
the cost of systems has increased with
 
00:58:39.829 --> 00:58:39.839 align:start position:0%
the cost of everything else so you are
 
00:58:42.470 --> 00:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
correct there would be an incremental uh
 
00:58:44.390 --> 00:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
if we only got the first half we'd be
 
00:58:46.309 --> 00:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
better off than we are now but it
 
00:58:50.309 --> 00:58:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:52.069 --> 00:58:52.079 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that the cost of systems
 
00:58:54.069 --> 00:58:54.079 align:start position:0%
has been increasing uh can you give me
 
00:58:56.150 --> 00:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
some idea on how much they've increasing
 
00:58:58.470 --> 00:58:58.480 align:start position:0%
relative to other goods and services
 
00:58:59.349 --> 00:58:59.359 align:start position:0%
that we
 
00:59:01.589 --> 00:59:01.599 align:start position:0%
would typically be aware of well
 
00:59:03.670 --> 00:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
the average inflation rate is 8.6
 
00:59:05.670 --> 00:59:05.680 align:start position:0%
our friends over at the administrative
 
00:59:07.109 --> 00:59:07.119 align:start position:0%
offices of the court have the same
 
00:59:09.750 --> 00:59:09.760 align:start position:0%
system we presently have they just did a
 
00:59:11.829 --> 00:59:11.839 align:start position:0%
request for quote and the
 
00:59:15.109 --> 00:59:15.119 align:start position:0%
the systems that are available now are
 
00:59:18.950 --> 00:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
um between 2.5 and 3x
 
00:59:23.270 --> 00:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:25.430 --> 00:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
and we we expect that the existing
 
00:59:28.870 --> 00:59:28.880 align:start position:0%
system will likely be retired within the
 
00:59:31.430 --> 00:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
some some years because the existing
 
00:59:34.069 --> 00:59:34.079 align:start position:0%
system is a
 
00:59:36.309 --> 00:59:36.319 align:start position:0%
traditional on-premise
 
00:59:36.319 --> 00:59:37.430 align:start position:0%
traditional on-premise
software

00:59:37.430 --> 00:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
software
 
00:59:39.270 --> 00:59:39.280 align:start position:0%
most of the industry's going away from
 
00:59:41.510 --> 00:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
that and they're going into you know the
 
00:59:43.750 --> 00:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
what called euphemistically the cloud
 
00:59:45.109 --> 00:59:45.119 align:start position:0%
where it's actually software as a
 
00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
service so when you buy it you're not
 
00:59:49.349 --> 00:59:49.359 align:start position:0%
actually putting software in your data
 
00:59:51.430 --> 00:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
center you're actually accessing it
 
00:59:53.510 --> 00:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
on the internet so that's where the in
 
00:59:55.030 --> 00:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
the software industry as a whole is
 
00:59:56.950 --> 00:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
going and we expect
 
00:59:58.950 --> 00:59:58.960 align:start position:0%
we will be forced out of using this at
 
01:00:01.910 --> 01:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
some point anyway much like we have with
 
01:00:05.510 --> 01:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:06.870 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:06.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:07.750 align:start position:0%
okay
question

01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:00:10.309 --> 01:00:10.319 align:start position:0%
so in addition to
 
01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
um you know whatever
 
01:00:15.670 --> 01:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
um you know how however much the
 
01:00:18.630 --> 01:00:18.640 align:start position:0%
management system would end up costing
 
01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
to buy
 
01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
off-the-shelf software to implement this
 
01:00:26.230 --> 01:00:26.240 align:start position:0%
then uh because it's on the cloud is
 
01:00:27.750 --> 01:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
there a subscription
 
01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
to that on an annual basis yes we have
 
01:00:32.069 --> 01:00:32.079 align:start position:0%
annual and that's what i was referring
 
01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:34.240 align:start position:0%
to we have annual maintenance that we
 
01:00:35.990 --> 01:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
pay on this now
 
01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:00:39.109 --> 01:00:39.119 align:start position:0%
rather than paying annual maintenance
 
01:00:41.190 --> 01:00:41.200 align:start position:0%
what what you uh we'd be paying a
 
01:00:43.190 --> 01:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
subscription which includes the main
 
01:00:45.589 --> 01:00:45.599 align:start position:0%
which typically if you do the math would
 
01:00:45.599 --> 01:00:47.190 align:start position:0%
which typically if you do the math would
include

01:00:47.190 --> 01:00:47.200 align:start position:0%
include
 
01:00:49.589 --> 01:00:49.599 align:start position:0%
maintenance plus the systems that it's
 
01:00:51.990 --> 01:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
running on amortized over the useful
 
01:00:53.829 --> 01:00:53.839 align:start position:0%
life of the system press plus a profit
 
01:00:56.870 --> 01:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
margin for the company so it nets out
 
01:00:59.349 --> 01:00:59.359 align:start position:0%
similarly over time but
 
01:01:01.349 --> 01:01:01.359 align:start position:0%
often there's a larger investment bump
 
01:01:02.789 --> 01:01:02.799 align:start position:0%
in the beginning so software as a
 
01:01:04.870 --> 01:01:04.880 align:start position:0%
service has a smaller investment bump at
 
01:01:07.990 --> 01:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
the beginning and then a higher ongoing
 
01:01:11.190 --> 01:01:11.200 align:start position:0%
run rate because you're paying for that
 
01:01:15.430 --> 01:01:15.440 align:start position:0%
for the entire loaded cost of the system
 
01:01:18.549 --> 01:01:18.559 align:start position:0%
over time versus in one lump big payment
 
01:01:20.390 --> 01:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
up front
 
01:01:23.349 --> 01:01:23.359 align:start position:0%
and another and no lumps later so you
 
01:01:25.670 --> 01:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
have that five or seven year uh refresh
 
01:01:27.190 --> 01:01:27.200 align:start position:0%
that has to happen where you you would
 
01:01:28.789 --> 01:01:28.799 align:start position:0%
tr in a traditional model you'd have a
 
01:01:30.710 --> 01:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
big cost bump where you don't in
 
01:01:33.589 --> 01:01:33.599 align:start position:0%
software as a service typically
 
01:01:36.549 --> 01:01:36.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:40.309 --> 01:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
and i'd like to invite department of
 
01:02:05.910 --> 01:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:07.510 --> 01:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
01:02:08.950 --> 01:02:08.960 align:start position:0%
i'm charlie arlinghaus i'm the
 
01:02:11.109 --> 01:02:11.119 align:start position:0%
commissioner of administrative services
 
01:02:12.390 --> 01:02:12.400 align:start position:0%
and who are you
 
01:02:14.069 --> 01:02:14.079 align:start position:0%
i'm karen rantamackie director of plant
 
01:02:15.750 --> 01:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
and property
 
01:02:17.589 --> 01:02:17.599 align:start position:0%
so what we're going to do you see on
 
01:02:19.510 --> 01:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
your agenda you've got i think it's five
 
01:02:21.750 --> 01:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
or maybe six bullets in front of you and
 
01:02:23.109 --> 01:02:23.119 align:start position:0%
so we're going to start we're going to
 
01:02:24.150 --> 01:02:24.160 align:start position:0%
talk about
 
01:02:26.710 --> 01:02:26.720 align:start position:0%
property in the and stuff like that and
 
01:02:28.630 --> 01:02:28.640 align:start position:0%
then at the end i'm going to talk about
 
01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
the i.t thing
 
01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:31.510 align:start position:0%
the i.t thing
um

01:02:31.510 --> 01:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:33.029 --> 01:02:33.039 align:start position:0%
the big it thing and there's a big
 
01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
elephant in the room that we're going to
 
01:02:36.789 --> 01:02:36.799 align:start position:0%
talk about at the same time but uh in
 
01:02:38.950 --> 01:02:38.960 align:start position:0%
the interim uh karen i'll start by
 
01:02:41.109 --> 01:02:41.119 align:start position:0%
talking about property um because
 
01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
because karen's a professional engineer
 
01:02:45.430 --> 01:02:45.440 align:start position:0%
and uh i'm a professional
 
01:02:46.789 --> 01:02:46.799 align:start position:0%
well i'm not a professional engineer
 
01:02:50.549 --> 01:02:50.559 align:start position:0%
let's just go with that um and um
 
01:02:52.549 --> 01:02:52.559 align:start position:0%
but i wanted i want to set the context
 
01:02:53.829 --> 01:02:53.839 align:start position:0%
for what she's going to talk about a
 
01:02:55.109 --> 01:02:55.119 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
01:02:55.119 --> 01:02:56.870 align:start position:0%
little bit
um

01:02:56.870 --> 01:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:58.630 --> 01:02:58.640 align:start position:0%
i it was interesting listening to the
 
01:03:00.789 --> 01:03:00.799 align:start position:0%
university system talk about their capex
 
01:03:02.470 --> 01:03:02.480 align:start position:0%
spending and their target goals and you
 
01:03:04.549 --> 01:03:04.559 align:start position:0%
know percentage of deprecia depreciation
 
01:03:06.069 --> 01:03:06.079 align:start position:0%
and all that and i thought wouldn't it
 
01:03:08.390 --> 01:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
be wonderful if we could get to that and
 
01:03:11.029 --> 01:03:11.039 align:start position:0%
we basically spend um the change we can
 
01:03:13.190 --> 01:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
find in the in the couch cushions and
 
01:03:15.029 --> 01:03:15.039 align:start position:0%
then fix the things that are falling
 
01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:16.720 align:start position:0%
apart worst
 
01:03:19.430 --> 01:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
is our is our sort of state policy for
 
01:03:21.510 --> 01:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
about 20 or 30 years on
 
01:03:23.430 --> 01:03:23.440 align:start position:0%
on how we deal with the with the capital
 
01:03:24.630 --> 01:03:24.640 align:start position:0%
infrastructure it's a slight
 
01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:26.069 align:start position:0%
infrastructure it's a slight
exaggeration

01:03:26.069 --> 01:03:26.079 align:start position:0%
exaggeration
 
01:03:26.079 --> 01:03:27.990 align:start position:0%
exaggeration
but

01:03:27.990 --> 01:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:03:29.589 --> 01:03:29.599 align:start position:0%
we talk sometimes how do you determine
 
01:03:31.670 --> 01:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
what to what to go in and i i'm going to
 
01:03:33.029 --> 01:03:33.039 align:start position:0%
tell the story which i think i've told
 
01:03:35.029 --> 01:03:35.039 align:start position:0%
the last two capital budget hearings
 
01:03:36.870 --> 01:03:36.880 align:start position:0%
about six bucket leaks
 
01:03:38.470 --> 01:03:38.480 align:start position:0%
and 12 bucket leaks
 
01:03:40.309 --> 01:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
and karen is very nice not to roll her
 
01:03:42.390 --> 01:03:42.400 align:start position:0%
eyes um but
 
01:03:44.549 --> 01:03:44.559 align:start position:0%
um i had a discussion once um karen's
 
01:03:46.789 --> 01:03:46.799 align:start position:0%
predecessor steve laurenson so karen and
 
01:03:49.029 --> 01:03:49.039 align:start position:0%
steve and i uh were meeting and he
 
01:03:51.670 --> 01:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
talked about um our requests are the are
 
01:03:53.349 --> 01:03:53.359 align:start position:0%
the 12 bucket leaks none of the six
 
01:03:55.349 --> 01:03:55.359 align:start position:0%
bucket leaks and i said i'm not really
 
01:03:56.710 --> 01:03:56.720 align:start position:0%
familiar with that term what does it
 
01:03:56.720 --> 01:03:57.589 align:start position:0%
familiar with that term what does it
mean

01:03:57.589 --> 01:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
mean
 
01:03:59.510 --> 01:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
and he said well i'll give an example at
 
01:04:01.109 --> 01:04:01.119 align:start position:0%
the dairy courthouse
 
01:04:03.349 --> 01:04:03.359 align:start position:0%
when it and very might be wrong but when
 
01:04:04.630 --> 01:04:04.640 align:start position:0%
it rains
 
01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
we put a bucket on certain desks where
 
01:04:09.109 --> 01:04:09.119 align:start position:0%
there's a leak
 
01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
to catch the water as it drips in and
 
01:04:13.990 --> 01:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
and there are places where people the
 
01:04:15.430 --> 01:04:15.440 align:start position:0%
computer goes on the left of the desk
 
01:04:16.630 --> 01:04:16.640 align:start position:0%
not the right because we don't want it
 
01:04:18.950 --> 01:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
to drip on it and if there's six of them
 
01:04:21.109 --> 01:04:21.119 align:start position:0%
it's a six bucket leak and i thought oh
 
01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
i could have figured that out um
 
01:04:25.349 --> 01:04:25.359 align:start position:0%
but he said we don't ask for money to
 
01:04:27.829 --> 01:04:27.839 align:start position:0%
replace six bucket leaks because we
 
01:04:29.430 --> 01:04:29.440 align:start position:0%
don't have enough money we only do the
 
01:04:32.150 --> 01:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
12 bucket leaks um and that's the
 
01:04:34.789 --> 01:04:34.799 align:start position:0%
state's general approach to um to
 
01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
capital costs and and building uh
 
01:04:39.750 --> 01:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
maintaining buildings
 
01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
and so we're going to talk to you
 
01:04:42.309 --> 01:04:42.319 align:start position:0%
instead of talking to you about
 
01:04:44.950 --> 01:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
um there's 36 of 38 projects on the
 
01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
initial list
 
01:04:49.029 --> 01:04:49.039 align:start position:0%
but the governor um
 
01:04:51.829 --> 01:04:51.839 align:start position:0%
tightened our focus to about six of them
 
01:04:54.470 --> 01:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
um so we're going to talk about that and
 
01:04:57.750 --> 01:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:57.760 --> 01:04:59.270 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:04:59.270 --> 01:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:01.910 --> 01:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
we do have pictures we can send around i
 
01:05:03.589 --> 01:05:03.599 align:start position:0%
don't have copies for everyone because
 
01:05:06.309 --> 01:05:06.319 align:start position:0%
they're in color and we don't have
 
01:05:08.710 --> 01:05:08.720 align:start position:0%
uh the resources to make multiple copies
 
01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:10.240 align:start position:0%
of all these but um
 
01:05:11.349 --> 01:05:11.359 align:start position:0%
these are just a couple of our
 
01:05:14.069 --> 01:05:14.079 align:start position:0%
facilities that um well we have the kent
 
01:05:16.230 --> 01:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
wing which is part of main building
 
01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:17.109 align:start position:0%
wing which is part of main building
and

01:05:17.109 --> 01:05:17.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:05:19.430 --> 01:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
the paisley annex which is also part of
 
01:05:21.670 --> 01:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
main building to kind of show how
 
01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:23.190 align:start position:0%
main building to kind of show how
extreme

01:05:23.190 --> 01:05:23.200 align:start position:0%
extreme
 
01:05:25.349 --> 01:05:25.359 align:start position:0%
our buildings can go if we don't put the
 
01:05:27.190 --> 01:05:27.200 align:start position:0%
money into them and and and do the
 
01:05:29.750 --> 01:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
maintenance that they require um
 
01:05:31.109 --> 01:05:31.119 align:start position:0%
one of the projects that we won't be
 
01:05:32.549 --> 01:05:32.559 align:start position:0%
talking about today but we did request
 
01:05:34.390 --> 01:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
funding for is a comprehensive paving
 
01:05:36.549 --> 01:05:36.559 align:start position:0%
project so we also have some pictures to
 
01:05:38.230 --> 01:05:38.240 align:start position:0%
show examples of you know what some of
 
01:05:39.750 --> 01:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
the pavement and our
 
01:05:45.829 --> 01:05:45.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:47.349 --> 01:05:47.359 align:start position:0%
yeah so feel free to take a look and
 
01:05:54.390 --> 01:05:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:55.829 --> 01:05:55.839 align:start position:0%
okay so i already let you know i'm karen
 
01:05:57.430 --> 01:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
rantamacky i'm the director of plant
 
01:05:58.390 --> 01:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
property for department of
 
01:06:00.470 --> 01:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
administrative services and today i'll
 
01:06:02.309 --> 01:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
be providing an overview of the projects
 
01:06:03.990 --> 01:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
requested for the division of plant
 
01:06:05.430 --> 01:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
property within the department of
 
01:06:07.270 --> 01:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
administrative services
 
01:06:09.190 --> 01:06:09.200 align:start position:0%
this division is made up of the bureaus
 
01:06:11.829 --> 01:06:11.839 align:start position:0%
of general services court facilities
 
01:06:13.589 --> 01:06:13.599 align:start position:0%
facilities and asset management and we
 
01:06:15.589 --> 01:06:15.599 align:start position:0%
also provide energy management services
 
01:06:17.829 --> 01:06:17.839 align:start position:0%
to state agencies and oversee the
 
01:06:20.230 --> 01:06:20.240 align:start position:0%
capital emergency fund
 
01:06:21.910 --> 01:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
that fund is available to all agencies
 
01:06:24.309 --> 01:06:24.319 align:start position:0%
for unforeseen emergency repairs
 
01:06:26.630 --> 01:06:26.640 align:start position:0%
as we all navigate the changing economy
 
01:06:28.069 --> 01:06:28.079 align:start position:0%
new hampshire state government as well
 
01:06:29.750 --> 01:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
as the rest of the world has encountered
 
01:06:32.470 --> 01:06:32.480 align:start position:0%
project delays lack of available labor
 
01:06:34.230 --> 01:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
and increased cost on the majority of
 
01:06:35.510 --> 01:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
its projects and i mentioned that
 
01:06:38.069 --> 01:06:38.079 align:start position:0%
because we've seen this
 
01:06:39.589 --> 01:06:39.599 align:start position:0%
throughout the past few years that our
 
01:06:41.510 --> 01:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
projects are coming in higher than we
 
01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:43.750 align:start position:0%
projects are coming in higher than we
anticipated

01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
anticipated
 
01:06:45.029 --> 01:06:45.039 align:start position:0%
i was asked to speak about seven
 
01:06:46.470 --> 01:06:46.480 align:start position:0%
projects today starting with the bureau
 
01:06:48.230 --> 01:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
of general services and the mechanical
 
01:06:49.829 --> 01:06:49.839 align:start position:0%
repairs needed at the health and human
 
01:06:51.829 --> 01:06:51.839 align:start position:0%
services and environmental services
 
01:06:54.230 --> 01:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
building at 29 hayes and drive
 
01:06:55.589 --> 01:06:55.599 align:start position:0%
this is a large project that would
 
01:06:58.230 --> 01:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
replace two existing chillers
 
01:06:59.670 --> 01:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
that are nearing the end of their useful
 
01:07:01.510 --> 01:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
life clinton property has already
 
01:07:03.430 --> 01:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
authorized the design work to begin on
 
01:07:05.109 --> 01:07:05.119 align:start position:0%
this project due to its urgent nature so
 
01:07:07.670 --> 01:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
we've done testing and we found that the
 
01:07:09.270 --> 01:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
these chillers are nearing the end of
 
01:07:11.029 --> 01:07:11.039 align:start position:0%
their useful useful life and will likely
 
01:07:13.589 --> 01:07:13.599 align:start position:0%
need to be uh replaced soon hopefully
 
01:07:13.599 --> 01:07:14.470 align:start position:0%
need to be uh replaced soon hopefully
not

01:07:14.470 --> 01:07:14.480 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:07:18.470 --> 01:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
before we get approval for this funding
 
01:07:19.990 --> 01:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
these chillers are part of the critical
 
01:07:21.589 --> 01:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
system that regulates the climate in the
 
01:07:23.589 --> 01:07:23.599 align:start position:0%
public health labs
 
01:07:25.270 --> 01:07:25.280 align:start position:0%
and that facility cannot operate without
 
01:07:27.109 --> 01:07:27.119 align:start position:0%
these units
 
01:07:28.789 --> 01:07:28.799 align:start position:0%
the second project under the bureau of
 
01:07:30.710 --> 01:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
general services is at the emergency
 
01:07:32.470 --> 01:07:32.480 align:start position:0%
operations center and that's another
 
01:07:34.069 --> 01:07:34.079 align:start position:0%
critical building that must remain
 
01:07:36.549 --> 01:07:36.559 align:start position:0%
operational the various repairs needed
 
01:07:38.309 --> 01:07:38.319 align:start position:0%
at this facility include repairs to the
 
01:07:40.069 --> 01:07:40.079 align:start position:0%
water supply tanks
 
01:07:41.670 --> 01:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
and those are used
 
01:07:43.589 --> 01:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
for the facility to remain open in case
 
01:07:44.950 --> 01:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
we're unable to gain access to the
 
01:07:46.950 --> 01:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
public water supply
 
01:07:48.870 --> 01:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
also repairs to the fuel oil tank which
 
01:07:51.109 --> 01:07:51.119 align:start position:0%
allows the emergency generator to run
 
01:07:53.109 --> 01:07:53.119 align:start position:0%
and the installation of an emergency
 
01:07:54.789 --> 01:07:54.799 align:start position:0%
power connection which would allow us to
 
01:07:57.190 --> 01:07:57.200 align:start position:0%
bring in a portable emergency generator
 
01:08:01.270 --> 01:08:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:02.950 --> 01:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
um the bureau of court facilities i'll
 
01:08:04.630 --> 01:08:04.640 align:start position:0%
talk about next
 
01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:05.990 align:start position:0%
talk about next
um

01:08:05.990 --> 01:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:08.230 --> 01:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
do you want me to stop in between or no
 
01:08:11.510 --> 01:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
okay okay um
 
01:08:13.589 --> 01:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
and the bureau of court facilities works
 
01:08:15.430 --> 01:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
in conjunction with the judicial branch
 
01:08:17.590 --> 01:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
to prioritize their request so their top
 
01:08:19.829 --> 01:08:19.839 align:start position:0%
request for this coming biennium is for
 
01:08:21.269 --> 01:08:21.279 align:start position:0%
the construction of a new courthouse in
 
01:08:21.279 --> 01:08:22.550 align:start position:0%
the construction of a new courthouse in
rochester

01:08:22.550 --> 01:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
rochester
 
01:08:24.789 --> 01:08:24.799 align:start position:0%
the funding for the design was approved
 
01:08:26.709 --> 01:08:26.719 align:start position:0%
in the last biennium and that design is
 
01:08:29.590 --> 01:08:29.600 align:start position:0%
underway now so the 14.8 million dollar
 
01:08:31.189 --> 01:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
request would fund the construction of
 
01:08:33.749 --> 01:08:33.759 align:start position:0%
the rochester circuit court
 
01:08:35.910 --> 01:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
and the existing facility does not meet
 
01:08:37.749 --> 01:08:37.759 align:start position:0%
current courthouse standards and has no
 
01:08:39.510 --> 01:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
space to include the rochester family
 
01:08:41.590 --> 01:08:41.600 align:start position:0%
division which is currently located
 
01:08:43.669 --> 01:08:43.679 align:start position:0%
elsewhere and and has proved to be
 
01:08:47.030 --> 01:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
confusing for the clientele
 
01:08:48.550 --> 01:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
the next bureau is the bureau of
 
01:08:50.309 --> 01:08:50.319 align:start position:0%
facility and asset management and we've
 
01:08:52.070 --> 01:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
requested funding to increase the number
 
01:08:54.789 --> 01:08:54.799 align:start position:0%
of heating zones in the fair building
 
01:08:56.789 --> 01:08:56.799 align:start position:0%
this building is nearly 100 000 square
 
01:08:58.470 --> 01:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
feet and it's currently heated with just
 
01:09:00.709 --> 01:09:00.719 align:start position:0%
five zones the lack of sufficient
 
01:09:02.550 --> 01:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
sufficient zones means areas of the
 
01:09:04.550 --> 01:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
building are consistently too hot or too
 
01:09:06.870 --> 01:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
cold and when boilers boilers are
 
01:09:08.950 --> 01:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
adjusted to compensate it results in
 
01:09:11.110 --> 01:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
overheating and wasted energy
 
01:09:13.430 --> 01:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
this is typically the most common uh
 
01:09:15.269 --> 01:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
request that my staff get in terms of
 
01:09:16.709 --> 01:09:16.719 align:start position:0%
service calls throughout the day so
 
01:09:18.149 --> 01:09:18.159 align:start position:0%
we're always responding to people that
 
01:09:19.749 --> 01:09:19.759 align:start position:0%
are you know complaining about the space
 
01:09:19.759 --> 01:09:22.950 align:start position:0%
are you know complaining about the space
temperature

01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:24.470 --> 01:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
next is the office of state energy
 
01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:25.829 align:start position:0%
next is the office of state energy
management

01:09:25.829 --> 01:09:25.839 align:start position:0%
management
 
01:09:27.189 --> 01:09:27.199 align:start position:0%
and this
 
01:09:29.829 --> 01:09:29.839 align:start position:0%
uh office as i mentioned earlier assists
 
01:09:31.590 --> 01:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
all state agencies with energy saving
 
01:09:33.990 --> 01:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
projects in state-owned facilities
 
01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
agencies submit reports annually on the
 
01:09:37.829 --> 01:09:37.839 align:start position:0%
projects that they would like to do
 
01:09:39.910 --> 01:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
projects are evaluated by energy
 
01:09:41.349 --> 01:09:41.359 align:start position:0%
management staff and those with
 
01:09:43.510 --> 01:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
favorable payback numbers are funded
 
01:09:45.189 --> 01:09:45.199 align:start position:0%
some examples from this year's list
 
01:09:47.430 --> 01:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
include projects for insulation high
 
01:09:49.430 --> 01:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
efficiency heat pumps for heating and
 
01:09:51.829 --> 01:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
cooling boilers and furnaces windows and
 
01:09:53.910 --> 01:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
lighting controls so with that request
 
01:09:56.310 --> 01:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
we request a lump sum and then it's
 
01:09:57.830 --> 01:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
allocated throughout the biennium to
 
01:10:00.630 --> 01:10:00.640 align:start position:0%
those projects that i mentioned earlier
 
01:10:02.149 --> 01:10:02.159 align:start position:0%
additionally the state energy manager
 
01:10:04.070 --> 01:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
submitted a second request for funds to
 
01:10:06.149 --> 01:10:06.159 align:start position:0%
upgrade the remaining fluorescent or
 
01:10:08.550 --> 01:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
other older technology lighting to leds
 
01:10:10.149 --> 01:10:10.159 align:start position:0%
and this would be throughout
 
01:10:11.510 --> 01:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
all of our state-owned buildings
 
01:10:12.950 --> 01:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
throughout the state not just
 
01:10:16.229 --> 01:10:16.239 align:start position:0%
administrative services but all agencies
 
01:10:17.750 --> 01:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
this relatively simple project could
 
01:10:19.669 --> 01:10:19.679 align:start position:0%
save the state a considerable amount in
 
01:10:21.510 --> 01:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
electricity costs if it were to be
 
01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:23.189 align:start position:0%
electricity costs if it were to be
completed

01:10:23.189 --> 01:10:23.199 align:start position:0%
completed
 
01:10:24.870 --> 01:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
there are also some economies of scale
 
01:10:26.229 --> 01:10:26.239 align:start position:0%
that could be exploited if the project
 
01:10:28.229 --> 01:10:28.239 align:start position:0%
was undertaken as a whole and not
 
01:10:30.630 --> 01:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
piecemeal as funding has allowed or when
 
01:10:32.229 --> 01:10:32.239 align:start position:0%
other work was done in a facility the
 
01:10:33.750 --> 01:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
state has slowly started to migrate to
 
01:10:35.189 --> 01:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
led lighting
 
01:10:36.709 --> 01:10:36.719 align:start position:0%
it is estimated that about half of the
 
01:10:38.870 --> 01:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
state square footage still needs to be
 
01:10:42.709 --> 01:10:42.719 align:start position:0%
converted to be to be converted to led
 
01:10:44.149 --> 01:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
the average payback period for this
 
01:10:45.910 --> 01:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
lighting when so solely considering the
 
01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
energy cost is seven and a half years
 
01:10:49.590 --> 01:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
and this would also result in
 
01:10:51.510 --> 01:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
significant maintenance savings as well
 
01:10:53.430 --> 01:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
as a better work environment for our
 
01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:55.030 align:start position:0%
as a better work environment for our
staff

01:10:55.030 --> 01:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
staff
 
01:10:56.550 --> 01:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
and then finally the division of plant
 
01:10:58.149 --> 01:10:58.159 align:start position:0%
property is requesting one and a half
 
01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
million in emergency funds and the
 
01:11:02.470 --> 01:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
emergency fund is available to any state
 
01:11:04.470 --> 01:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
agency for emergency repair work to any
 
01:11:06.550 --> 01:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
of its state-owned facilities
 
01:11:08.229 --> 01:11:08.239 align:start position:0%
in the recent past the emergency fund
 
01:11:10.229 --> 01:11:10.239 align:start position:0%
has been used for elevator repairs
 
01:11:13.110 --> 01:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
repairing leaks in hvac piping boiler
 
01:11:15.189 --> 01:11:15.199 align:start position:0%
repairs and structural stabilization of
 
01:11:17.030 --> 01:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
underground tunnels
 
01:11:19.910 --> 01:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
and that concludes my testimony
 
01:11:22.390 --> 01:11:22.400 align:start position:0%
just a couple things to put in context
 
01:11:24.950 --> 01:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
what we do for people there are three
 
01:11:27.910 --> 01:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
major bureaus in plant and property that
 
01:11:30.149 --> 01:11:30.159 align:start position:0%
manage all of the state that managed a
 
01:11:31.510 --> 01:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
building for all three branches of
 
01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:32.709 align:start position:0%
building for all three branches of
government

01:11:32.709 --> 01:11:32.719 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:11:35.030 --> 01:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
we manage the office buildings we manage
 
01:11:37.990 --> 01:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
the courthouses we manage the
 
01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
the buildings in which
 
01:11:41.830 --> 01:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
people work or we store things
 
01:11:44.870 --> 01:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
what we don't manage are
 
01:11:47.030 --> 01:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
patient or residential
 
01:11:49.750 --> 01:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
housing so for example
 
01:11:52.229 --> 01:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
think of corrections as a residential
 
01:11:53.350 --> 01:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
if you will
 
01:11:55.830 --> 01:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
um but hospitals we don't do glenn cliff
 
01:11:57.430 --> 01:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
we don't do the sununu center we don't
 
01:11:59.110 --> 01:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
do um
 
01:12:00.790 --> 01:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
uh new hampshire hospital we don't do
 
01:12:03.510 --> 01:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
the prison um but we do if the
 
01:12:05.350 --> 01:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
department of x is working somewhere
 
01:12:07.669 --> 01:12:07.679 align:start position:0%
this is what we do there are two pieces
 
01:12:09.669 --> 01:12:09.679 align:start position:0%
of plant and property though that that
 
01:12:09.679 --> 01:12:10.630 align:start position:0%
of plant and property though that that
serve

01:12:10.630 --> 01:12:10.640 align:start position:0%
serve
 
01:12:12.470 --> 01:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
all state buildings regardless the one
 
01:12:13.590 --> 01:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
is the emergency fund because
 
01:12:16.390 --> 01:12:16.400 align:start position:0%
emergencies are not confined to
 
01:12:18.390 --> 01:12:18.400 align:start position:0%
they happen everywhere and the other is
 
01:12:21.030 --> 01:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
energy we do energy efficiency in in
 
01:12:22.950 --> 01:12:22.960 align:start position:0%
hundreds of buildings not the
 
01:12:25.110 --> 01:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
90 or 95 buildings that are that are
 
01:12:27.990 --> 01:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
part of our direct management so so
 
01:12:29.830 --> 01:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
that's the piece where that is i
 
01:12:32.870 --> 01:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned before that that there's a lot
 
01:12:33.990 --> 01:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
to fix
 
01:12:36.709 --> 01:12:36.719 align:start position:0%
i mean frankly at on some point if you
 
01:12:38.630 --> 01:12:38.640 align:start position:0%
wanted to fund capital budget projects
 
01:12:40.950 --> 01:12:40.960 align:start position:0%
somewhere between 12 million and 800
 
01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:41.990 align:start position:0%
somewhere between 12 million and 800
million

01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:12:44.550 --> 01:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
we would be able to spend it easily and
 
01:12:47.510 --> 01:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
be fixing stuff that needs fixing
 
01:12:49.590 --> 01:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
we're going to work
 
01:12:51.189 --> 01:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
probably over probably toward the end of
 
01:12:52.630 --> 01:12:52.640 align:start position:0%
the summer
 
01:12:54.709 --> 01:12:54.719 align:start position:0%
with some legislators on the the house
 
01:12:56.470 --> 01:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
finance in particular has expressed an
 
01:12:57.750 --> 01:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
interest in
 
01:13:00.790 --> 01:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
in management and
 
01:13:03.270 --> 01:13:03.280 align:start position:0%
i committed to well initially at fiscal
 
01:13:04.870 --> 01:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
to representative edwards but to talk
 
01:13:06.870 --> 01:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
about happy to talk to you about what we
 
01:13:08.630 --> 01:13:08.640 align:start position:0%
do and what we track and how we track it
 
01:13:10.070 --> 01:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
and we're built he apparently has a
 
01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:12.070 align:start position:0%
and we're built he apparently has a
building

01:13:12.070 --> 01:13:12.080 align:start position:0%
building
 
01:13:14.310 --> 01:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
interest i think is the right expression
 
01:13:16.550 --> 01:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
um and what i'm what i've offered is to
 
01:13:17.669 --> 01:13:17.679 align:start position:0%
tour buildings because people are
 
01:13:19.510 --> 01:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
occasionally you know
 
01:13:21.990 --> 01:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
you get invited to like dra which is the
 
01:13:23.990 --> 01:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
nicest building in state government or
 
01:13:25.669 --> 01:13:25.679 align:start position:0%
employment security which is the second
 
01:13:27.510 --> 01:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
nicest building in state government
 
01:13:29.110 --> 01:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
probably you have very few meetings in
 
01:13:32.070 --> 01:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
the main building or johnson or
 
01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:33.270 align:start position:0%
the main building or johnson or
laundering

01:13:33.270 --> 01:13:33.280 align:start position:0%
laundering
 
01:13:35.750 --> 01:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
um where large portions of those three
 
01:13:38.790 --> 01:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
buildings are just dumps
 
01:13:39.990 --> 01:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:13:41.189 --> 01:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
and it's the kind of thing we like to
 
01:13:43.430 --> 01:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
show people so um we're gonna pause
 
01:13:46.709 --> 01:13:46.719 align:start position:0%
before we do um i.t stuff so if people
 
01:13:50.709 --> 01:13:50.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:52.550 --> 01:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
sure representative
 
01:13:54.790 --> 01:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
thank you um commissioner
 
01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:55.990 align:start position:0%
thank you um commissioner
um

01:13:55.990 --> 01:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:58.630 --> 01:13:58.640 align:start position:0%
looking at your initial list
 
01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:01.280 align:start position:0%
the longer one there are several items
 
01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:02.790 align:start position:0%
the longer one there are several items
that

01:14:02.790 --> 01:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:14:04.790 --> 01:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
potentially could be paid with arpa
 
01:14:08.709 --> 01:14:08.719 align:start position:0%
funds hvac and some other how seriously
 
01:14:11.590 --> 01:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
have we been looking at using
 
01:14:15.030 --> 01:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
those type of funds for any of these
 
01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:16.390 align:start position:0%
those type of funds for any of these
requests

01:14:16.390 --> 01:14:16.400 align:start position:0%
requests
 
01:14:19.189 --> 01:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
that are there and how far along are we
 
01:14:21.350 --> 01:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
with with that
 
01:14:22.950 --> 01:14:22.960 align:start position:0%
there was a there was one arpa fund
 
01:14:24.870 --> 01:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
project approved for hvac and i think
 
01:14:27.110 --> 01:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
it's 20 million dollars 24 million
 
01:14:29.510 --> 01:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
depending but some of it's dedicated
 
01:14:31.750 --> 01:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
um and um
 
01:14:33.750 --> 01:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
we're doing everything we can with that
 
01:14:35.990 --> 01:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
and sometimes the hvac work is done in
 
01:14:38.709 --> 01:14:38.719 align:start position:0%
conjunction with another project
 
01:14:39.990 --> 01:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
and it's certainly something we'll look
 
01:14:42.630 --> 01:14:42.640 align:start position:0%
at that's the only arpa use that that
 
01:14:44.470 --> 01:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
has come up so for
 
01:14:47.110 --> 01:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
for non-hvac work there is no arpa
 
01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:48.149 align:start position:0%
for non-hvac work there is no arpa
funding

01:14:48.149 --> 01:14:48.159 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:14:50.550 --> 01:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
um but for hvac work there is although
 
01:14:52.070 --> 01:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
there might be there's we've had some
 
01:14:55.350 --> 01:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
discussions with our with um
 
01:14:57.189 --> 01:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
oh my god i forgot their name gopher
 
01:14:58.229 --> 01:14:58.239 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
01:15:00.229 --> 01:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
um with gopher but other than that how
 
01:15:03.110 --> 01:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
far along would you say we are on hvac
 
01:15:04.950 --> 01:15:04.960 align:start position:0%
um yeah just to add a little bit of
 
01:15:07.830 --> 01:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
detail we have about six or seven uh
 
01:15:09.110 --> 01:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
facilities that we're working on
 
01:15:12.149 --> 01:15:12.159 align:start position:0%
currently with hvac unfortunately the 24
 
01:15:14.070 --> 01:15:14.080 align:start position:0%
million doesn't go as far as we all
 
01:15:16.070 --> 01:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
think it should um
 
01:15:18.070 --> 01:15:18.080 align:start position:0%
with hvac because they're all you know
 
01:15:19.910 --> 01:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
multi-million dollar projects with big
 
01:15:22.149 --> 01:15:22.159 align:start position:0%
big complicated buildings and um
 
01:15:24.390 --> 01:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
everything has become you know more
 
01:15:26.470 --> 01:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
expensive than it was a couple years ago
 
01:15:28.550 --> 01:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
so we do we are utilizing that i just
 
01:15:30.550 --> 01:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
checked it this morning i think we have
 
01:15:33.350 --> 01:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
um out of the 24 million i think we have
 
01:15:35.510 --> 01:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
about 20 of it committed
 
01:15:37.590 --> 01:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
um to projects with a little bit left
 
01:15:39.590 --> 01:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
over for things that might go over
 
01:15:41.590 --> 01:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
budget or you know one more project that
 
01:15:47.910 --> 01:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:49.189 --> 01:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
01:15:49.199 --> 01:15:50.229 align:start position:0%
good morning
um

01:15:50.229 --> 01:15:50.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:52.790 --> 01:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
the pictures that you passed around were
 
01:15:55.350 --> 01:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
were very interesting um
 
01:15:58.310 --> 01:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
you're not requesting funds for those
 
01:16:00.070 --> 01:16:00.080 align:start position:0%
projects in this
 
01:16:03.510 --> 01:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
can you tell us um about how many
 
01:16:05.110 --> 01:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
you know how many square feet are
 
01:16:09.350 --> 01:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:11.189 --> 01:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
you pass pictures around
 
01:16:13.430 --> 01:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
you have a rough ballpark on that
 
01:16:18.470 --> 01:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:19.990 --> 01:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
if you want to think in broad global
 
01:16:21.669 --> 01:16:21.679 align:start position:0%
terms about the buildings that we manage
 
01:16:22.950 --> 01:16:22.960 align:start position:0%
there are the buildings in concord and
 
01:16:24.870 --> 01:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
the buildings that are not in concord
 
01:16:26.870 --> 01:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
the buildings not in concord are
 
01:16:29.669 --> 01:16:29.679 align:start position:0%
typically um court facilities but not
 
01:16:31.990 --> 01:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
exclusively court facilities and the
 
01:16:33.510 --> 01:16:33.520 align:start position:0%
buildings in concord except for the ones
 
01:16:36.470 --> 01:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
with the label court or not
 
01:16:38.070 --> 01:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
we manage about
 
01:16:40.709 --> 01:16:40.719 align:start position:0%
2.2 ish million square feet of office
 
01:16:42.790 --> 01:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
space i think in concord and then
 
01:16:46.229 --> 01:16:46.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:48.310 --> 01:16:48.320 align:start position:0%
space that we currently describe as
 
01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:49.669 align:start position:0%
space that we currently describe as
unusable

01:16:49.669 --> 01:16:49.679 align:start position:0%
unusable
 
01:16:51.110 --> 01:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
which would be those pictures which
 
01:16:53.750 --> 01:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
would be so think of bancroft kent wing
 
01:16:55.990 --> 01:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
peasley annex uh
 
01:16:57.590 --> 01:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
kent annex
 
01:16:59.189 --> 01:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
a bunch of the the sort of tentacle
 
01:17:01.270 --> 01:17:01.280 align:start position:0%
additions to the main building on the
 
01:17:03.430 --> 01:17:03.440 align:start position:0%
state hospital campus and most of the
 
01:17:05.270 --> 01:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
dreadful stuff is on the state the old
 
01:17:06.950 --> 01:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
state hospital campus
 
01:17:08.709 --> 01:17:08.719 align:start position:0%
i would say that's what do you think
 
01:17:10.390 --> 01:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
four or five hundred thousand
 
01:17:13.110 --> 01:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
i'd say less than that but
 
01:17:15.990 --> 01:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
so so i think the main building if you
 
01:17:18.229 --> 01:17:18.239 align:start position:0%
take the whole thing bancroft excluded
 
01:17:20.390 --> 01:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
is about 300 000 square feet and we're
 
01:17:22.870 --> 01:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
using about 200 000 square feet does
 
01:17:25.030 --> 01:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
that sound about right and then bancroft
 
01:17:26.750 --> 01:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
is another
 
01:17:29.830 --> 01:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
45 000 square feet is that right yeah i
 
01:17:31.990 --> 01:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
would say 40 but yeah yeah so
 
01:17:34.550 --> 01:17:34.560 align:start position:0%
so probably about 150 000
 
01:17:36.630 --> 01:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
that looks similar to the pictures that
 
01:17:38.709 --> 01:17:38.719 align:start position:0%
i passed around the broader point about
 
01:17:40.390 --> 01:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
the picture though that i want to make
 
01:17:43.590 --> 01:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
sure i make is is um
 
01:17:45.350 --> 01:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
so when i started as commissioner which
 
01:17:47.270 --> 01:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
is which is almost exactly five years
 
01:17:49.350 --> 01:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
ago now um
 
01:17:50.870 --> 01:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
one of the first things i did is i i
 
01:17:52.070 --> 01:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
took a
 
01:17:53.669 --> 01:17:53.679 align:start position:0%
a tour for lack of a better word of a
 
01:17:55.910 --> 01:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
bunch of our facilities i was actually
 
01:17:58.070 --> 01:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
excited about going to the pleasant
 
01:17:59.990 --> 01:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
street campus because they have tunnels
 
01:18:02.070 --> 01:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
and i kind of like tunnels
 
01:18:04.149 --> 01:18:04.159 align:start position:0%
and they're actually kind of cool
 
01:18:04.159 --> 01:18:06.310 align:start position:0%
and they're actually kind of cool
but

01:18:06.310 --> 01:18:06.320 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:18:08.550 --> 01:18:08.560 align:start position:0%
we walked through at some point we
 
01:18:09.910 --> 01:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
walked through the main building and
 
01:18:11.350 --> 01:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
there are pieces of it that are all
 
01:18:12.790 --> 01:18:12.800 align:start position:0%
different so we entered the building
 
01:18:14.229 --> 01:18:14.239 align:start position:0%
through kent
 
01:18:16.630 --> 01:18:16.640 align:start position:0%
um old kent and kent annex and then we
 
01:18:17.910 --> 01:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
walked through the regular part of the
 
01:18:19.669 --> 01:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
main building we went to paisley annex
 
01:18:21.750 --> 01:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
and we ended up in the north pavilion
 
01:18:24.070 --> 01:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
and what's what's typical of those three
 
01:18:25.110 --> 01:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
buildings and there's no reason
 
01:18:26.550 --> 01:18:26.560 align:start position:0%
everybody would know necessarily what
 
01:18:27.669 --> 01:18:27.679 align:start position:0%
those are
 
01:18:27.679 --> 01:18:29.189 align:start position:0%
those are
is

01:18:29.189 --> 01:18:29.199 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:18:32.630 --> 01:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
we walk in kent and somebody said to me
 
01:18:35.270 --> 01:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
don't look around look down
 
01:18:36.870 --> 01:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
and if the floor looks like you might
 
01:18:38.630 --> 01:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
fall through it you probably will so
 
01:18:42.149 --> 01:18:42.159 align:start position:0%
step carefully and the piles of
 
01:18:44.070 --> 01:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
stuff are exactly what you think they
 
01:18:46.390 --> 01:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
are because we can't keep all the birds
 
01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:47.510 align:start position:0%
are because we can't keep all the birds
out

01:18:47.510 --> 01:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:18:49.510 --> 01:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
in raccoons and
 
01:18:51.510 --> 01:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
things like that
 
01:18:53.750 --> 01:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
this is a building that is
 
01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:55.110 align:start position:0%
this is a building that is
probably

01:18:55.110 --> 01:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
probably
 
01:18:57.270 --> 01:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
gone or close to gone
 
01:18:59.510 --> 01:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
we went to paisley annex which we were
 
01:19:01.030 --> 01:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
which we'd been doing some cleaning work
 
01:19:03.350 --> 01:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
on you know cleaning out all the
 
01:19:06.630 --> 01:19:06.640 align:start position:0%
accumulated detritus of many
 
01:19:08.470 --> 01:19:08.480 align:start position:0%
of a century and a half
 
01:19:10.229 --> 01:19:10.239 align:start position:0%
um and then we're starting to do
 
01:19:12.310 --> 01:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
structural work which uh turned out that
 
01:19:14.470 --> 01:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
it's probably not habitable um at least
 
01:19:16.390 --> 01:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
not for anything very heavy
 
01:19:18.470 --> 01:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
um and then we ended up in north
 
01:19:20.070 --> 01:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
pavilion i think it's called north
 
01:19:22.790 --> 01:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
pavilion anyway which is
 
01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:23.669 align:start position:0%
pavilion anyway which is
um

01:19:23.669 --> 01:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:23.679 --> 01:19:24.870 align:start position:0%
um
lovely

01:19:24.870 --> 01:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
lovely
 
01:19:26.630 --> 01:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
very nice office space modern cubicles
 
01:19:28.149 --> 01:19:28.159 align:start position:0%
and you wouldn't know you were in 150
 
01:19:31.110 --> 01:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
year old building i mean it it it could
 
01:19:33.030 --> 01:19:33.040 align:start position:0%
be it was one of the nicer spaces in
 
01:19:35.189 --> 01:19:35.199 align:start position:0%
state government and it's sort of an a b
 
01:19:37.590 --> 01:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
and c thing if we don't spend money on
 
01:19:39.270 --> 01:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
buildings they will decay
 
01:19:41.750 --> 01:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
the worst example of that is the is the
 
01:19:43.590 --> 01:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
thing in laconia
 
01:19:45.669 --> 01:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
a whole bunch of buildings that are now
 
01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
of now a fitting monument to it's some
 
01:19:51.350 --> 01:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
of its horrible uses because they're
 
01:19:53.430 --> 01:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
decayed horrible and we can't let people
 
01:19:55.750 --> 01:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
in because you'll get i mean we don't
 
01:19:57.669 --> 01:19:57.679 align:start position:0%
let people in wearing hazmat suits right
 
01:19:57.679 --> 01:19:58.470 align:start position:0%
let people in wearing hazmat suits right
now

01:19:58.470 --> 01:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:20:00.390 --> 01:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
because the mold is so bad
 
01:20:01.830 --> 01:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
and we don't want buildings to get that
 
01:20:03.510 --> 01:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
way so that so we have buildings in
 
01:20:06.229 --> 01:20:06.239 align:start position:0%
various stages very few
 
01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
are at the point of laconia
 
01:20:09.990 --> 01:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
not that many are at the point of kent
 
01:20:11.430 --> 01:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
that you looked at you know a couple
 
01:20:13.430 --> 01:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand square feet but every
 
01:20:15.510 --> 01:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
building has the potential to get there
 
01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:16.830 align:start position:0%
building has the potential to get there
except

01:20:16.830 --> 01:20:16.840 align:start position:0%
except
 
01:20:20.070 --> 01:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
probably walker employment security and
 
01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:22.229 align:start position:0%
probably walker employment security and
dra

01:20:22.229 --> 01:20:22.239 align:start position:0%
dra
 
01:20:23.189 --> 01:20:23.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:20:25.430 --> 01:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
substantial amount of square footage
 
01:20:27.510 --> 01:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
lying dormant
 
01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:28.390 align:start position:0%
lying dormant
a

01:20:28.390 --> 01:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:20:31.430 --> 01:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
question the how recent are the cost
 
01:20:33.030 --> 01:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
estimates used to put together that you
 
01:20:35.510 --> 01:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
put together for these projects and do
 
01:20:37.990 --> 01:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
they are are they fairly recent and the
 
01:20:40.070 --> 01:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
fact that they've taken into account the
 
01:20:41.830 --> 01:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
dramatic increase in prices we've seen
 
01:20:43.510 --> 01:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
but more importantly
 
01:20:45.830 --> 01:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
do they take into account the rising
 
01:20:47.510 --> 01:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
prices we're still expecting certainly
 
01:20:51.030 --> 01:20:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:53.030 --> 01:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
i i'd say most of the pricing is from
 
01:20:55.669 --> 01:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
the february time frame but i i agree
 
01:20:57.910 --> 01:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
even between february and today
 
01:21:00.629 --> 01:21:00.639 align:start position:0%
there's been a huge shift in pricing
 
01:21:02.550 --> 01:21:02.560 align:start position:0%
um and i can't say what they're gonna
 
01:21:04.229 --> 01:21:04.239 align:start position:0%
look like next summer when the funds
 
01:21:06.310 --> 01:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
actually get approved
 
01:21:08.790 --> 01:21:08.800 align:start position:0%
so so all the capital budget stuff is
 
01:21:10.790 --> 01:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
you know the deadline to submit it is
 
01:21:13.910 --> 01:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
february something right and so agencies
 
01:21:15.669 --> 01:21:15.679 align:start position:0%
are our agency too
 
01:21:17.669 --> 01:21:17.679 align:start position:0%
are putting them together in a time
 
01:21:20.390 --> 01:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
frame in december and january of last
 
01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:21.910 align:start position:0%
frame in december and january of last
year

01:21:21.910 --> 01:21:21.920 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:21:24.070 --> 01:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
typically you know the the piece of the
 
01:21:26.310 --> 01:21:26.320 align:start position:0%
process where the the projects that make
 
01:21:28.629 --> 01:21:28.639 align:start position:0%
an initial first cut by
 
01:21:30.229 --> 01:21:30.239 align:start position:0%
the chief executive
 
01:21:34.070 --> 01:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
are sent to public works for estimate
 
01:21:36.149 --> 01:21:36.159 align:start position:0%
those estimates often result in very
 
01:21:38.790 --> 01:21:38.800 align:start position:0%
different numbers in part because
 
01:21:40.790 --> 01:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
public workers works is charged with
 
01:21:43.590 --> 01:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
with taking into account um current
 
01:21:45.590 --> 01:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
pricing and trying to predict for the
 
01:21:46.870 --> 01:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
future god knows how they're going to
 
01:21:48.790 --> 01:21:48.800 align:start position:0%
predict for the future this year
 
01:21:51.110 --> 01:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
um but i but i would say that almost
 
01:21:52.470 --> 01:21:52.480 align:start position:0%
every project that you're going to see
 
01:21:54.390 --> 01:21:54.400 align:start position:0%
before you um that's going to be an
 
01:21:55.990 --> 01:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
issue and you know by the time it gets
 
01:21:59.270 --> 01:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:00.390 --> 01:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
you know some of the estimates are going
 
01:22:01.990 --> 01:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
to be quite old and god knows what's
 
01:22:03.750 --> 01:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
happening with inflation and the good
 
01:22:05.830 --> 01:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
news though i would bet the payback
 
01:22:08.149 --> 01:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
number for the energy projects
 
01:22:10.870 --> 01:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
is quicker because energy rates uh
 
01:22:12.790 --> 01:22:12.800 align:start position:0%
inflation may be eight and a half but
 
01:22:14.950 --> 01:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
heating oil is 93
 
01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:15.990 align:start position:0%
heating oil is 93
so

01:22:15.990 --> 01:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:22:17.590 --> 01:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
you know some of and electric costs are
 
01:22:19.750 --> 01:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
going nuts so we might have a quicker
 
01:22:24.229 --> 01:22:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:26.709 --> 01:22:26.719 align:start position:0%
um commissioner you were talking about
 
01:22:28.950 --> 01:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
building sticky and stuff i think it was
 
01:22:31.750 --> 01:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
about 18 years ago we did a master plan
 
01:22:33.189 --> 01:22:33.199 align:start position:0%
on the hughes
 
01:22:35.830 --> 01:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
um office park and for a while we
 
01:22:38.229 --> 01:22:38.239 align:start position:0%
followed it that we didn't i would
 
01:22:41.189 --> 01:22:41.199 align:start position:0%
suggest that you look at maybe
 
01:22:41.199 --> 01:22:42.709 align:start position:0%
suggest that you look at maybe
requesting

01:22:42.709 --> 01:22:42.719 align:start position:0%
requesting
 
01:22:44.950 --> 01:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
something in in the capital budget or
 
01:22:47.430 --> 01:22:47.440 align:start position:0%
your operating budget to do something
 
01:22:48.790 --> 01:22:48.800 align:start position:0%
similar with
 
01:22:51.590 --> 01:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
a larger scope of buildings you know are
 
01:22:53.669 --> 01:22:53.679 align:start position:0%
we ever going to fix them are we going
 
01:22:56.310 --> 01:22:56.320 align:start position:0%
to have to spend money to
 
01:22:58.870 --> 01:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
tear them down
 
01:23:00.709 --> 01:23:00.719 align:start position:0%
and to have a plan
 
01:23:03.510 --> 01:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
to present to the legislature you know
 
01:23:06.950 --> 01:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
for a multi-biennium process to to do
 
01:23:09.110 --> 01:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
all of that because
 
01:23:11.030 --> 01:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
doing things two years at a time just
 
01:23:13.590 --> 01:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to cut it and even when we
 
01:23:15.430 --> 01:23:15.440 align:start position:0%
have a master plan we don't always keep
 
01:23:17.750 --> 01:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
going on it because other things take
 
01:23:20.790 --> 01:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
priority like a prison well i would like
 
01:23:22.629 --> 01:23:22.639 align:start position:0%
a person um
 
01:23:24.629 --> 01:23:24.639 align:start position:0%
uh jesus then that price tag god knows
 
01:23:26.310 --> 01:23:26.320 align:start position:0%
if we'll build anything else
 
01:23:27.910 --> 01:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
um the um
 
01:23:29.750 --> 01:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
well great minds think alike
 
01:23:31.350 --> 01:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
so uh karen and i have been talking
 
01:23:33.270 --> 01:23:33.280 align:start position:0%
recently about master plans and and for
 
01:23:34.709 --> 01:23:34.719 align:start position:0%
for committee members who don't know
 
01:23:36.550 --> 01:23:36.560 align:start position:0%
there was a master plan done on
 
01:23:38.790 --> 01:23:38.800 align:start position:0%
the pleasant street campus in
 
01:23:41.830 --> 01:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
uh 95 and then the second one in 2004
 
01:23:44.070 --> 01:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
and the 2004 one is the one that you can
 
01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:45.110 align:start position:0%
and the 2004 one is the one that you can
find

01:23:45.110 --> 01:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
find
 
01:23:47.430 --> 01:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
online buried somewhere on the public
 
01:23:49.590 --> 01:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
works website um you have to dig a
 
01:23:50.950 --> 01:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
little to get there but you can get
 
01:23:52.950 --> 01:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
there but you're right that a lot of it
 
01:23:54.709 --> 01:23:54.719 align:start position:0%
you know at the time spalding was i
 
01:23:55.910 --> 01:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
think the only building that had been
 
01:23:57.590 --> 01:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
recently renovated
 
01:23:59.910 --> 01:23:59.920 align:start position:0%
and um and the rest had not
 
01:24:01.590 --> 01:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
but we looked at it and you know is that
 
01:24:03.270 --> 01:24:03.280 align:start position:0%
is that where we want to go now is that
 
01:24:05.510 --> 01:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
where we by the way a lot of it is still
 
01:24:07.669 --> 01:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
if you dig that out
 
01:24:09.030 --> 01:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
not bad
 
01:24:11.350 --> 01:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
um but um
 
01:24:13.750 --> 01:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
we were talking and
 
01:24:15.350 --> 01:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
i was discussing with karen whether we
 
01:24:17.110 --> 01:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
do multiple master plans like you know
 
01:24:19.830 --> 01:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
one for hazen one for downtown one for
 
01:24:22.310 --> 01:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
the campus or we just do one for state
 
01:24:24.070 --> 01:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
buildings in concord
 
01:24:26.149 --> 01:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
which i think might make more sense
 
01:24:26.159 --> 01:24:27.750 align:start position:0%
which i think might make more sense
because

01:24:27.750 --> 01:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:24:30.310 --> 01:24:30.320 align:start position:0%
what you end up doing on you know
 
01:24:32.790 --> 01:24:32.800 align:start position:0%
downtown or on hazen is probably
 
01:24:34.709 --> 01:24:34.719 align:start position:0%
influenced by whether you've met needs
 
01:24:35.990 --> 01:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
like what if we take
 
01:24:37.910 --> 01:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
doit for example and plop them in a
 
01:24:39.910 --> 01:24:39.920 align:start position:0%
cornfield on clinton street
 
01:24:42.470 --> 01:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
um i mean in a building right not just
 
01:24:45.510 --> 01:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
in a cornfield but um
 
01:24:46.870 --> 01:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
it would kind of change what we do on
 
01:24:51.510 --> 01:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:52.950 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:24:52.950 --> 01:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:24:54.390 --> 01:24:54.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:24:55.990 --> 01:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
okay if there's nothing else on
 
01:24:58.870 --> 01:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
buildings um no don't go anywhere
 
01:24:59.830 --> 01:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
because there could still be something
 
01:25:01.030 --> 01:25:01.040 align:start position:0%
on buildings
 
01:25:02.790 --> 01:25:02.800 align:start position:0%
um there's uh i want to talk to you
 
01:25:05.510 --> 01:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
about i.t there is there is one it
 
01:25:07.030 --> 01:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
project on your list but it's not the
 
01:25:08.950 --> 01:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
big it project there's a request for a
 
01:25:10.709 --> 01:25:10.719 align:start position:0%
learning management system
 
01:25:14.070 --> 01:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
um the state in something like 2015
 
01:25:16.149 --> 01:25:16.159 align:start position:0%
purchased uh moodle
 
01:25:19.110 --> 01:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
um i think literally as a result of a
 
01:25:21.270 --> 01:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
of a training project that
 
01:25:23.830 --> 01:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
some bet course as part of their
 
01:25:25.990 --> 01:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
certified public manager work had come
 
01:25:27.189 --> 01:25:27.199 align:start position:0%
up with the idea to do a learning
 
01:25:29.030 --> 01:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
management system and we bought an
 
01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:30.310 align:start position:0%
management system and we bought an
off-the-shelf

01:25:30.310 --> 01:25:30.320 align:start position:0%
off-the-shelf
 
01:25:31.590 --> 01:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
very free
 
01:25:35.270 --> 01:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
is it freeware i think that they call it
 
01:25:37.750 --> 01:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
open source so it's free except until
 
01:25:39.669 --> 01:25:39.679 align:start position:0%
you try to run it and then it's less a
 
01:25:41.830 --> 01:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
lot less free yes and it's a lot less
 
01:25:44.070 --> 01:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
free and it's been worth every bit that
 
01:25:47.510 --> 01:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
we paid for it um it's it's perfectly
 
01:25:49.510 --> 01:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
reasonably adequate if you're not trying
 
01:25:51.510 --> 01:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
to do anything complicated
 
01:25:54.070 --> 01:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
um but uh learning management if the
 
01:25:56.310 --> 01:25:56.320 align:start position:0%
state is going to invest in in employee
 
01:25:59.270 --> 01:25:59.280 align:start position:0%
training is essential and uh somebody
 
01:26:01.510 --> 01:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
said at fiscal a month ago that
 
01:26:03.270 --> 01:26:03.280 align:start position:0%
you know i believe a learning management
 
01:26:05.990 --> 01:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
system is part of any any competent hr
 
01:26:08.550 --> 01:26:08.560 align:start position:0%
operation and i'm sure that the state
 
01:26:11.110 --> 01:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
has a pretty good one and i said you
 
01:26:12.790 --> 01:26:12.800 align:start position:0%
know the
 
01:26:14.709 --> 01:26:14.719 align:start position:0%
some of those statements are true
 
01:26:17.669 --> 01:26:17.679 align:start position:0%
um so so that's a piece um it would
 
01:26:20.390 --> 01:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
probably cost about 750 000 and we could
 
01:26:22.790 --> 01:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
integrate it into new hampshire first
 
01:26:24.070 --> 01:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
the bigger picture is new hampshire
 
01:26:26.310 --> 01:26:26.320 align:start position:0%
first there is not
 
01:26:28.390 --> 01:26:28.400 align:start position:0%
there is not here
 
01:26:30.629 --> 01:26:30.639 align:start position:0%
a capital request for
 
01:26:32.390 --> 01:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
an update to the state's enterprise
 
01:26:34.550 --> 01:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
system the state's enterprise system is
 
01:26:37.669 --> 01:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
the computer system that runs the entire
 
01:26:41.590 --> 01:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
operation financials budget payroll hr
 
01:26:43.510 --> 01:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
procurement pick something i'm sure i
 
01:26:45.430 --> 01:26:45.440 align:start position:0%
left 12 things out but
 
01:26:46.950 --> 01:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
basically everything you do is done
 
01:26:49.030 --> 01:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
through one giant system administered by
 
01:26:50.390 --> 01:26:50.400 align:start position:0%
our department of financial data
 
01:26:52.229 --> 01:26:52.239 align:start position:0%
management it's much more than just
 
01:26:53.750 --> 01:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
financial data
 
01:26:56.870 --> 01:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
the state in in 2007 and 8
 
01:26:58.709 --> 01:26:58.719 align:start position:0%
stood up a new system after having a
 
01:27:01.430 --> 01:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
homegrown one that had fallen apart
 
01:27:03.030 --> 01:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
um it wasn't homegrown we just stopped
 
01:27:04.709 --> 01:27:04.719 align:start position:0%
ever updating it and keeping up with the
 
01:27:06.870 --> 01:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
updates and so it you know at that time
 
01:27:08.310 --> 01:27:08.320 align:start position:0%
there were you know two guys left who
 
01:27:09.430 --> 01:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
knew how to do it and they were both
 
01:27:10.870 --> 01:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
gonna retire
 
01:27:13.189 --> 01:27:13.199 align:start position:0%
um so we set up a new one and uh the
 
01:27:15.750 --> 01:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
winning bidder at that time was lawson
 
01:27:17.830 --> 01:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
lawson has since been bought by infor in
 
01:27:20.390 --> 01:27:20.400 align:start position:0%
for us who manages our system we are at
 
01:27:21.430 --> 01:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
a place
 
01:27:23.189 --> 01:27:23.199 align:start position:0%
we do upgrade the system now which is
 
01:27:25.430 --> 01:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
really important um
 
01:27:27.430 --> 01:27:27.440 align:start position:0%
for a comparison purpose should this
 
01:27:29.350 --> 01:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
think of it this way should the state
 
01:27:31.110 --> 01:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
try to run as computers on windows
 
01:27:32.790 --> 01:27:32.800 align:start position:0%
windows 95
 
01:27:34.310 --> 01:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
or should we keep going forward and
 
01:27:36.229 --> 01:27:36.239 align:start position:0%
upgrading every time we go to 98 and
 
01:27:36.239 --> 01:27:37.030 align:start position:0%
upgrading every time we go to 98 and
then

01:27:37.030 --> 01:27:37.040 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:27:39.110 --> 01:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
whatever followed that like was 98 is
 
01:27:40.629 --> 01:27:40.639 align:start position:0%
what i have at home so
 
01:27:40.639 --> 01:27:41.510 align:start position:0%
what i have at home so
um

01:27:41.510 --> 01:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:44.149 --> 01:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
but uh we kept carrying forward and kept
 
01:27:45.669 --> 01:27:45.679 align:start position:0%
updating the system so that it is
 
01:27:47.270 --> 01:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
continually supported
 
01:27:49.669 --> 01:27:49.679 align:start position:0%
the next upgrade is is called going to
 
01:27:53.189 --> 01:27:53.199 align:start position:0%
the cloud it has a component of it
 
01:27:55.030 --> 01:27:55.040 align:start position:0%
the upgrade happens to be also called
 
01:27:57.270 --> 01:27:57.280 align:start position:0%
cloud suite but it is a
 
01:28:00.149 --> 01:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
massive update to the state's financial
 
01:28:03.270 --> 01:28:03.280 align:start position:0%
system in particular we are at a point
 
01:28:05.189 --> 01:28:05.199 align:start position:0%
where our staff and duit are in
 
01:28:07.590 --> 01:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
discussions about what what do we do
 
01:28:09.270 --> 01:28:09.280 align:start position:0%
because the state has functionally three
 
01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:10.870 align:start position:0%
because the state has functionally three
choices

01:28:10.870 --> 01:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
choices
 
01:28:12.709 --> 01:28:12.719 align:start position:0%
uh the one choice is to do nothing to
 
01:28:14.310 --> 01:28:14.320 align:start position:0%
decide that continually upgrading the
 
01:28:16.790 --> 01:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
system is too expensive this is a choice
 
01:28:18.229 --> 01:28:18.239 align:start position:0%
the state has made in the past on
 
01:28:18.239 --> 01:28:19.270 align:start position:0%
the state has made in the past on
occasion

01:28:19.270 --> 01:28:19.280 align:start position:0%
occasion
 
01:28:21.110 --> 01:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
the upgrades really are expensive and
 
01:28:22.790 --> 01:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
they cost a lot of money every year to
 
01:28:24.470 --> 01:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
keep up to date
 
01:28:25.910 --> 01:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
and at some point you can just get off
 
01:28:28.550 --> 01:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
the ferris wheel and stop then
 
01:28:29.990 --> 01:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
eventually that collapses and your
 
01:28:31.590 --> 01:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
computer system looks like the pictures
 
01:28:34.470 --> 01:28:34.480 align:start position:0%
of kentling that i passed out
 
01:28:35.990 --> 01:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
and that's where we've had problems in
 
01:28:37.669 --> 01:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
the past and there there are legacy
 
01:28:40.629 --> 01:28:40.639 align:start position:0%
systems in various
 
01:28:42.470 --> 01:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
holes inside state government where that
 
01:28:43.910 --> 01:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
still exists
 
01:28:46.310 --> 01:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
um the second thing you can do is buy a
 
01:28:48.390 --> 01:28:48.400 align:start position:0%
whole new system a whole new erp
 
01:28:50.149 --> 01:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
we're going to upgrade massive upgrade
 
01:28:52.070 --> 01:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
is the time when you might want to
 
01:28:54.070 --> 01:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
bid and reprocure and you look at oracle
 
01:28:57.189 --> 01:28:57.199 align:start position:0%
and workday and and six others i'm sure
 
01:28:58.629 --> 01:28:58.639 align:start position:0%
that uh make
 
01:29:01.430 --> 01:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
um systems um and in for the current
 
01:29:03.590 --> 01:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
product um
 
01:29:05.430 --> 01:29:05.440 align:start position:0%
that's more expensive
 
01:29:06.790 --> 01:29:06.800 align:start position:0%
but it's starting from scratch i would
 
01:29:08.229 --> 01:29:08.239 align:start position:0%
say that's one of the two options that
 
01:29:10.470 --> 01:29:10.480 align:start position:0%
we're actively considering i think that
 
01:29:12.550 --> 01:29:12.560 align:start position:0%
we're not actively considering doing
 
01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:13.910 align:start position:0%
we're not actively considering doing
nothing

01:29:13.910 --> 01:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
01:29:15.830 --> 01:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
i think i think dennis's team and our
 
01:29:17.270 --> 01:29:17.280 align:start position:0%
team would both agree that doing nothing
 
01:29:17.280 --> 01:29:17.990 align:start position:0%
team would both agree that doing nothing
is

01:29:17.990 --> 01:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:29:19.750 --> 01:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
um silly
 
01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:20.550 align:start position:0%
um silly
um

01:29:20.550 --> 01:29:20.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:21.669 align:start position:0%
um
the

01:29:21.669 --> 01:29:21.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:29:23.990 --> 01:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
the middle ground if you will is to
 
01:29:25.910 --> 01:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
upgrade the current system
 
01:29:27.270 --> 01:29:27.280 align:start position:0%
but if you upgrade the current system
 
01:29:28.629 --> 01:29:28.639 align:start position:0%
you have to do it right and you have to
 
01:29:31.510 --> 01:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
do it in a fairly expensive manner
 
01:29:32.870 --> 01:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:29:35.030 --> 01:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
the rough cost estimates and you know we
 
01:29:36.229 --> 01:29:36.239 align:start position:0%
haven't gotten to the point of doing
 
01:29:38.709 --> 01:29:38.719 align:start position:0%
really really good cost estimates but in
 
01:29:41.110 --> 01:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
terms of not just buying the software
 
01:29:43.669 --> 01:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
but hiring the implementation teams
 
01:29:45.030 --> 01:29:45.040 align:start position:0%
because it's not something people can do
 
01:29:46.629 --> 01:29:46.639 align:start position:0%
in their spare time
 
01:29:48.390 --> 01:29:48.400 align:start position:0%
we make the mistake a lot of times where
 
01:29:50.390 --> 01:29:50.400 align:start position:0%
we add a project
 
01:29:51.910 --> 01:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
on the presumption that no one's
 
01:29:53.350 --> 01:29:53.360 align:start position:0%
actually working
 
01:29:54.870 --> 01:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
and that they don't actually have a job
 
01:29:56.790 --> 01:29:56.800 align:start position:0%
and they can just do this on the side
 
01:29:59.510 --> 01:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
and um it's possible there might be
 
01:30:01.110 --> 01:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
somebody somewhere where that's possible
 
01:30:02.870 --> 01:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
but none of them work for me
 
01:30:04.950 --> 01:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
and so that's uh that's not how that
 
01:30:07.110 --> 01:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
works so we'd have to hire people so
 
01:30:09.830 --> 01:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
probably 20 to 25 million would be the
 
01:30:12.629 --> 01:30:12.639 align:start position:0%
cost of uh at the low end
 
01:30:14.550 --> 01:30:14.560 align:start position:0%
of some sort of migration maybe a little
 
01:30:15.990 --> 01:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
higher than that frankly given what's
 
01:30:17.910 --> 01:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
going on with it
 
01:30:17.920 --> 01:30:19.030 align:start position:0%
going on with it
costs

01:30:19.030 --> 01:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
costs
 
01:30:21.510 --> 01:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
um and the upper end of it with the with
 
01:30:23.590 --> 01:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
the new procurement could be as much as
 
01:30:26.709 --> 01:30:26.719 align:start position:0%
90 or 100 i'm looking at dennis to say
 
01:30:29.030 --> 01:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
i'm crazy
 
01:30:30.070 --> 01:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
you're not
 
01:30:32.149 --> 01:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
i'm not there we go at least not in this
 
01:30:35.350 --> 01:30:35.360 align:start position:0%
respect um anyway that's where we are
 
01:30:37.430 --> 01:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
we're in discussions dennis's team and
 
01:30:41.510 --> 01:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
my team have talked we are likely in the
 
01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:42.790 align:start position:0%
my team have talked we are likely in the
um

01:30:42.790 --> 01:30:42.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:44.709 --> 01:30:44.719 align:start position:0%
in the late spring early summer to have
 
01:30:46.629 --> 01:30:46.639 align:start position:0%
a meeting with the
 
01:30:46.639 --> 01:30:47.910 align:start position:0%
a meeting with the
governor governor

01:30:47.910 --> 01:30:47.920 align:start position:0%
governor governor
 
01:30:49.750 --> 01:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
who as you know has strong perspectives
 
01:30:49.760 --> 01:30:50.790 align:start position:0%
who as you know has strong perspectives
on

01:30:50.790 --> 01:30:50.800 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:30:50.800 --> 01:30:52.149 align:start position:0%
on
technology

01:30:52.149 --> 01:30:52.159 align:start position:0%
technology
 
01:30:53.830 --> 01:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
um and its uses
 
01:30:55.830 --> 01:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
um and then at that point we might be we
 
01:30:58.310 --> 01:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
might be coming back that's out there
 
01:31:02.390 --> 01:31:02.400 align:start position:0%
and it's huge it's not men's prison huge
 
01:31:04.070 --> 01:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
but it's you know
 
01:31:05.750 --> 01:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
men's halfway house huge if you know
 
01:31:09.669 --> 01:31:09.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:11.669 --> 01:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
are there any questions if i may
 
01:31:11.679 --> 01:31:12.470 align:start position:0%
are there any questions if i may
just

01:31:12.470 --> 01:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:31:14.229 --> 01:31:14.239 align:start position:0%
one caution
 
01:31:16.870 --> 01:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
i know that on house
 
01:31:19.270 --> 01:31:19.280 align:start position:0%
committee on public works and highways
 
01:31:21.750 --> 01:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
there is growing concern
 
01:31:23.910 --> 01:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
about how much
 
01:31:23.920 --> 01:31:25.350 align:start position:0%
about how much
i.t

01:31:25.350 --> 01:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
i.t
 
01:31:28.149 --> 01:31:28.159 align:start position:0%
software and other things we are bonding
 
01:31:30.870 --> 01:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
for 20 years
 
01:31:33.030 --> 01:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
every time somebody comes in with with a
 
01:31:34.950 --> 01:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
new great idea
 
01:31:37.350 --> 01:31:37.360 align:start position:0%
when we have buildings that are falling
 
01:31:37.360 --> 01:31:38.550 align:start position:0%
when we have buildings that are falling
apart

01:31:38.550 --> 01:31:38.560 align:start position:0%
apart
 
01:31:41.030 --> 01:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
i don't know how we balance that
 
01:31:43.510 --> 01:31:43.520 align:start position:0%
but i just caution that there is that
 
01:31:45.750 --> 01:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
sentiment that goes
 
01:31:48.070 --> 01:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
well if we spend 50 million dollars of
 
01:31:51.270 --> 01:31:51.280 align:start position:0%
125 on software
 
01:31:54.390 --> 01:31:54.400 align:start position:0%
what building falls apart
 
01:31:54.400 --> 01:31:55.510 align:start position:0%
what building falls apart
so

01:31:55.510 --> 01:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:31:57.189 --> 01:31:57.199 align:start position:0%
yes so i resemble that remark in
 
01:31:59.510 --> 01:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
multiple ways right and we i had a
 
01:32:00.790 --> 01:32:00.800 align:start position:0%
conversation the other day where i
 
01:32:02.470 --> 01:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
talked about um
 
01:32:05.110 --> 01:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
you know real capital projects and i.t
 
01:32:07.350 --> 01:32:07.360 align:start position:0%
capital projects and i unfortunately i
 
01:32:09.189 --> 01:32:09.199 align:start position:0%
think i said it in front of dennis but
 
01:32:11.110 --> 01:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
um i didn't mean to but it's the same
 
01:32:12.870 --> 01:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
thing right we we have these we have
 
01:32:14.790 --> 01:32:14.800 align:start position:0%
these two tranches
 
01:32:16.550 --> 01:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:32:19.110 --> 01:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
and how do you balance it when when your
 
01:32:19.120 --> 01:32:20.149 align:start position:0%
and how do you balance it when when your
your

01:32:20.149 --> 01:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:32:22.629 --> 01:32:22.639 align:start position:0%
your price tag is 125 million and
 
01:32:24.310 --> 01:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
and it's the people who do the i know
 
01:32:26.709 --> 01:32:26.719 align:start position:0%
what karen would suggest we do
 
01:32:28.229 --> 01:32:28.239 align:start position:0%
and i know what dennis would suggest we
 
01:32:29.350 --> 01:32:29.360 align:start position:0%
do and i don't think that's the same
 
01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:35.430 align:start position:0%
do and i don't think that's the same
thing

01:32:35.430 --> 01:32:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:40.950 --> 01:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:42.550 --> 01:32:42.560 align:start position:0%
i'd like to invite the community college
 
01:32:44.070 --> 01:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
system of new hampshire
 
01:33:14.870 --> 01:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:26.629 --> 01:33:26.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:29.030 --> 01:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
good morning i'm mark rubinstein serving
 
01:33:30.470 --> 01:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
as the chancellor of the community
 
01:33:32.790 --> 01:33:32.800 align:start position:0%
college system of new hampshire
 
01:33:35.030 --> 01:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
joined by my colleague matt moore who
 
01:33:36.550 --> 01:33:36.560 align:start position:0%
many of you will know from his long
 
01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:37.669 align:start position:0%
many of you will know from his long
service

01:33:37.669 --> 01:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
service
 
01:33:39.110 --> 01:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the state and the community
 
01:33:40.310 --> 01:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
college system
 
01:33:43.110 --> 01:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
overseeing our facilities
 
01:33:44.390 --> 01:33:44.400 align:start position:0%
first i want to thank you for the
 
01:33:47.030 --> 01:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity to present this morning
 
01:33:49.669 --> 01:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
you have already a comprehensive packet
 
01:33:51.830 --> 01:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
and i don't want to take the time to
 
01:33:53.830 --> 01:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
walk through all of it i think like to
 
01:33:55.830 --> 01:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
try and prioritize the time you have for
 
01:33:55.840 --> 01:33:57.270 align:start position:0%
try and prioritize the time you have for
questions

01:33:57.270 --> 01:33:57.280 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:33:59.430 --> 01:33:59.440 align:start position:0%
but i would like to just address a few
 
01:34:02.070 --> 01:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
key points just for background
 
01:34:04.229 --> 01:34:04.239 align:start position:0%
virtually everything that we do is to
 
01:34:06.070 --> 01:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
support the workforce here in the state
 
01:34:07.350 --> 01:34:07.360 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
01:34:09.270 --> 01:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
this past year the community college
 
01:34:09.280 --> 01:34:10.229 align:start position:0%
this past year the community college
system

01:34:10.229 --> 01:34:10.239 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:34:13.910 --> 01:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
conferred degrees to 280 nurses in fact
 
01:34:16.629 --> 01:34:16.639 align:start position:0%
over the last 12 years 3 400 nurses
 
01:34:18.229 --> 01:34:18.239 align:start position:0%
graduated by the community college
 
01:34:20.390 --> 01:34:20.400 align:start position:0%
system of new hampshire
 
01:34:22.470 --> 01:34:22.480 align:start position:0%
during that same time
 
01:34:25.270 --> 01:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
over 800 automotive technicians nearly a
 
01:34:27.910 --> 01:34:27.920 align:start position:0%
thousand welders
 
01:34:29.830 --> 01:34:29.840 align:start position:0%
2 000 degrees and certificates in
 
01:34:32.310 --> 01:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
business a third of those in accounting
 
01:34:34.870 --> 01:34:34.880 align:start position:0%
so our work is really about preparing
 
01:34:37.030 --> 01:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
students to engage and grow in the new
 
01:34:42.070 --> 01:34:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:44.390 --> 01:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
our needs for capital in turn are built
 
01:34:46.709 --> 01:34:46.719 align:start position:0%
on that need the ability to sustain and
 
01:34:48.550 --> 01:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
expand those efforts and ultimately what
 
01:34:49.830 --> 01:34:49.840 align:start position:0%
we need to be able to do is deliver
 
01:34:52.149 --> 01:34:52.159 align:start position:0%
those programs throughout the state so
 
01:34:54.470 --> 01:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
our ability to concentrate in a single
 
01:34:57.270 --> 01:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
location uh would undercut our ability
 
01:35:02.229 --> 01:35:02.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:04.149 --> 01:35:04.159 align:start position:0%
having said that you will see from our
 
01:35:06.790 --> 01:35:06.800 align:start position:0%
packet some key projects
 
01:35:09.430 --> 01:35:09.440 align:start position:0%
little hall at nhti
 
01:35:11.910 --> 01:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
turner hall at lakes region community
 
01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:13.750 align:start position:0%
turner hall at lakes region community
college

01:35:13.750 --> 01:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
college
 
01:35:16.470 --> 01:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
both of those buildings uh approaching
 
01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:17.910 align:start position:0%
both of those buildings uh approaching
60.

01:35:17.910 --> 01:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
60.
 
01:35:19.590 --> 01:35:19.600 align:start position:0%
i've been on the earth longer than they
 
01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:20.390 align:start position:0%
i've been on the earth longer than they
are

01:35:20.390 --> 01:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:35:23.270 --> 01:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
they haven't i i know how aged they are
 
01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:25.350 align:start position:0%
they haven't i i know how aged they are
firsthand

01:35:25.350 --> 01:35:25.360 align:start position:0%
firsthand
 
01:35:26.870 --> 01:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
having said that
 
01:35:29.350 --> 01:35:29.360 align:start position:0%
if you look at those buildings
 
01:35:31.350 --> 01:35:31.360 align:start position:0%
what you're going to see are aged
 
01:35:34.070 --> 01:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
facilities worn facilities
 
01:35:36.629 --> 01:35:36.639 align:start position:0%
not the inspiring locations that we want
 
01:35:38.790 --> 01:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
to deliver forward-looking programs that
 
01:35:40.950 --> 01:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
our faculty try and inspire students
 
01:35:43.669 --> 01:35:43.679 align:start position:0%
with and some to some degree the
 
01:35:45.590 --> 01:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
challenge that we face is that those
 
01:35:47.830 --> 01:35:47.840 align:start position:0%
facilities are are worn to the point of
 
01:35:50.629 --> 01:35:50.639 align:start position:0%
concern for health and life safety we've
 
01:35:52.709 --> 01:35:52.719 align:start position:0%
got asbestos that we've got to deal with
 
01:35:53.990 --> 01:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
in little hall
 
01:35:56.550 --> 01:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
we've got roofs that are deteriorating
 
01:35:58.550 --> 01:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
we're somewhere between the university
 
01:36:00.950 --> 01:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
system and and commissioner arlinghaus
 
01:36:02.470 --> 01:36:02.480 align:start position:0%
we're we're not we're not just looking
 
01:36:04.070 --> 01:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
for change where we absolutely need the
 
01:36:06.790 --> 01:36:06.800 align:start position:0%
12 bucket uh situations
 
01:36:09.109 --> 01:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
but we do have some buildings that that
 
01:36:10.950 --> 01:36:10.960 align:start position:0%
require more attention than we can
 
01:36:13.030 --> 01:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
currently address and need support from
 
01:36:15.750 --> 01:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
the state for those
 
01:36:17.830 --> 01:36:17.840 align:start position:0%
what we're ultimately looking for isn't
 
01:36:20.149 --> 01:36:20.159 align:start position:0%
to rebuild the same buildings that we've
 
01:36:22.229 --> 01:36:22.239 align:start position:0%
we've had for those 60 years but we'd
 
01:36:24.229 --> 01:36:24.239 align:start position:0%
like to be able to ensure that those are
 
01:36:26.550 --> 01:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
functional spaces those are safe spaces
 
01:36:28.629 --> 01:36:28.639 align:start position:0%
that we have the flexibility to adapt
 
01:36:30.470 --> 01:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
curricula over time
 
01:36:32.229 --> 01:36:32.239 align:start position:0%
so that those can
 
01:36:33.830 --> 01:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
better reflect the ways in which
 
01:36:35.750 --> 01:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
teaching and learning happen they can
 
01:36:37.510 --> 01:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
change with the economy and the need for
 
01:36:39.350 --> 01:36:39.360 align:start position:0%
academic program
 
01:36:42.229 --> 01:36:42.239 align:start position:0%
one of the characteristics of the 1960s
 
01:36:43.669 --> 01:36:43.679 align:start position:0%
when those buildings were built in some
 
01:36:45.910 --> 01:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
cases a tendency towards specialization
 
01:36:48.310 --> 01:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
so we've got specialized spaces
 
01:36:49.910 --> 01:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
what we're looking for is to be able to
 
01:36:53.270 --> 01:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
recast that in in larger more flexible
 
01:36:55.030 --> 01:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
options so that we can integrate
 
01:36:57.430 --> 01:36:57.440 align:start position:0%
learning across programs and again adapt
 
01:37:02.229 --> 01:37:02.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:03.830 --> 01:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
the other thing that you'll notice in
 
01:37:06.229 --> 01:37:06.239 align:start position:0%
our presentation it's also reflected in
 
01:37:07.750 --> 01:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
critical maintenance just some
 
01:37:10.870 --> 01:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
overarching priorities
 
01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:12.470 align:start position:0%
overarching priorities
energy

01:37:12.470 --> 01:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
energy
 
01:37:14.629 --> 01:37:14.639 align:start position:0%
secure building envelopes and life
 
01:37:17.669 --> 01:37:17.679 align:start position:0%
safety issues so you'll see hvac roofs
 
01:37:19.750 --> 01:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
sprinklers asbestos mitigation those
 
01:37:21.189 --> 01:37:21.199 align:start position:0%
sorts of things
 
01:37:23.669 --> 01:37:23.679 align:start position:0%
those are just fundamental needs for the
 
01:37:26.070 --> 01:37:26.080 align:start position:0%
buildings to be appropriate for the use
 
01:37:28.470 --> 01:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
of our our students and our faculty to
 
01:37:30.310 --> 01:37:30.320 align:start position:0%
deliver the programs
 
01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:31.030 align:start position:0%
deliver the programs
so

01:37:31.030 --> 01:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:37:32.870 --> 01:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
let me stop at this point and see if
 
01:37:37.109 --> 01:37:37.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:37.119 --> 01:37:37.910 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:37:37.910 --> 01:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:37:39.669 --> 01:37:39.679 align:start position:0%
my question is one similar that i asked
 
01:37:42.950 --> 01:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
for at for unh and that is the the
 
01:37:46.149 --> 01:37:46.159 align:start position:0%
competition for students is intense
 
01:37:49.350 --> 01:37:49.360 align:start position:0%
and how do these capital improvements
 
01:37:52.629 --> 01:37:52.639 align:start position:0%
relate to your plan to not only
 
01:37:53.830 --> 01:37:53.840 align:start position:0%
retain students currently in your
 
01:37:55.430 --> 01:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
program but attract new ones and if you
 
01:37:57.830 --> 01:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
could talk about your competition
 
01:37:59.189 --> 01:37:59.199 align:start position:0%
and some of the things they might be
 
01:38:01.430 --> 01:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
doing and how
 
01:38:03.350 --> 01:38:03.360 align:start position:0%
you're either falling behind or keeping
 
01:38:05.189 --> 01:38:05.199 align:start position:0%
pace with them with these projects well
 
01:38:07.669 --> 01:38:07.679 align:start position:0%
we we've recently surveyed prospective
 
01:38:09.590 --> 01:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
students and and parents for our
 
01:38:11.109 --> 01:38:11.119 align:start position:0%
traditional age students and we've
 
01:38:12.790 --> 01:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
gotten significant feedback that
 
01:38:14.470 --> 01:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
facilities matter
 
01:38:16.310 --> 01:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
in some ways teaching and learning are
 
01:38:18.629 --> 01:38:18.639 align:start position:0%
hard to see unless you're actually there
 
01:38:20.070 --> 01:38:20.080 align:start position:0%
as a student
 
01:38:22.070 --> 01:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
so you look at the physical surroundings
 
01:38:24.390 --> 01:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
and you get a sense of of what the what
 
01:38:26.950 --> 01:38:26.960 align:start position:0%
the commitment is what the quality is
 
01:38:28.790 --> 01:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
and to the extent that as i said before
 
01:38:31.030 --> 01:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
we've got forward-looking faculty very
 
01:38:32.870 --> 01:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
creative and entrepreneurial and
 
01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:34.149 align:start position:0%
creative and entrepreneurial and
thoughtful

01:38:34.149 --> 01:38:34.159 align:start position:0%
thoughtful
 
01:38:36.149 --> 01:38:36.159 align:start position:0%
and they're teaching disciplines in stem
 
01:38:37.750 --> 01:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
and health care and other things that
 
01:38:39.590 --> 01:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
should be very future oriented but
 
01:38:41.669 --> 01:38:41.679 align:start position:0%
they're doing it in buildings that
 
01:38:43.270 --> 01:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
that even their parents think look
 
01:38:46.229 --> 01:38:46.239 align:start position:0%
outdated that's a problem the other part
 
01:38:48.070 --> 01:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
of competition is a little bit different
 
01:38:49.669 --> 01:38:49.679 align:start position:0%
for us
 
01:38:51.270 --> 01:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
significant number of our students are
 
01:38:53.430 --> 01:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
working adults they're already in the
 
01:38:55.189 --> 01:38:55.199 align:start position:0%
workforce and what they're looking for
 
01:38:56.709 --> 01:38:56.719 align:start position:0%
is a learning environment that's
 
01:38:58.870 --> 01:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
comparable consistent with the places
 
01:39:01.350 --> 01:39:01.360 align:start position:0%
where they're working if they see a
 
01:39:03.669 --> 01:39:03.679 align:start position:0%
setting that doesn't look like the place
 
01:39:05.350 --> 01:39:05.360 align:start position:0%
where they work doesn't look like the
 
01:39:08.390 --> 01:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
type of environment engineering
 
01:39:11.430 --> 01:39:11.440 align:start position:0%
facility or type of machining facility
 
01:39:13.750 --> 01:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
or culinary arts or automotive you know
 
01:39:15.430 --> 01:39:15.440 align:start position:0%
that that's problematic so what we're
 
01:39:17.109 --> 01:39:17.119 align:start position:0%
really trying to do is
 
01:39:19.350 --> 01:39:19.360 align:start position:0%
not just sell against competition we're
 
01:39:21.030 --> 01:39:21.040 align:start position:0%
actually trying to build congruence
 
01:39:22.709 --> 01:39:22.719 align:start position:0%
between what they and their employers
 
01:39:24.950 --> 01:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
recognize because a portion of our work
 
01:39:26.950 --> 01:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
as i said is with working adults already
 
01:39:28.870 --> 01:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
in the workforce cultivating
 
01:39:30.629 --> 01:39:30.639 align:start position:0%
relationships with their employers as
 
01:39:32.149 --> 01:39:32.159 align:start position:0%
partners and we've got to be able to
 
01:39:34.149 --> 01:39:34.159 align:start position:0%
deliver programs in settings that look
 
01:39:35.750 --> 01:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
very consistent with the world in which
 
01:39:38.950 --> 01:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
they're going to be expected to operate
 
01:39:42.149 --> 01:39:42.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:46.390 --> 01:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:48.790 --> 01:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
i know in the past we've partnered with
 
01:39:51.910 --> 01:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
industries and and groups to help fund
 
01:39:53.510 --> 01:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
some of these
 
01:39:53.520 --> 01:39:55.109 align:start position:0%
some of these
projects

01:39:55.109 --> 01:39:55.119 align:start position:0%
projects
 
01:39:57.669 --> 01:39:57.679 align:start position:0%
the dental association and others have
 
01:39:59.669 --> 01:39:59.679 align:start position:0%
stepped forward and looking at some of
 
01:40:02.950 --> 01:40:02.960 align:start position:0%
these is there anybody on your staff or
 
01:40:05.430 --> 01:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
on the board who is out trying to beat
 
01:40:08.149 --> 01:40:08.159 align:start position:0%
the bushes to see if somebody would help
 
01:40:08.159 --> 01:40:09.030 align:start position:0%
the bushes to see if somebody would help
with

01:40:09.030 --> 01:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:40:12.629 --> 01:40:12.639 align:start position:0%
the transportation related technology or
 
01:40:12.639 --> 01:40:15.750 align:start position:0%
the transportation related technology or
the

01:40:15.750 --> 01:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:17.669 --> 01:40:17.679 align:start position:0%
energy or any of the rest of that to
 
01:40:20.550 --> 01:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
help offset some of these costs rather
 
01:40:22.470 --> 01:40:22.480 align:start position:0%
than the state bearing at all when we're
 
01:40:25.350 --> 01:40:25.360 align:start position:0%
trading their new employees
 
01:40:27.910 --> 01:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
in short yes we've had good support from
 
01:40:30.470 --> 01:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
eversource for our our line workers
 
01:40:33.830 --> 01:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
program milton kat has provided 200 000
 
01:40:36.149 --> 01:40:36.159 align:start position:0%
to white mountains community college
 
01:40:38.149 --> 01:40:38.159 align:start position:0%
we've had gifts to lakes region for our
 
01:40:40.870 --> 01:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
culinary arts program we continue to
 
01:40:43.030 --> 01:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
look for those opportunities to align
 
01:40:44.709 --> 01:40:44.719 align:start position:0%
our interests with businesses and to
 
01:40:46.709 --> 01:40:46.719 align:start position:0%
recognize that it just shared shared
 
01:40:52.229 --> 01:40:52.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:54.149 --> 01:40:54.159 align:start position:0%
can i uh nice to see you again and i'd
 
01:40:56.070 --> 01:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
very clever of you to bring smokey with
 
01:40:57.910 --> 01:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
you i presume that when you go to house
 
01:40:59.910 --> 01:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
public works he'll be in the front row
 
01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:00.790 align:start position:0%
public works he'll be in the front row
um

01:41:00.790 --> 01:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:01.910 --> 01:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
just saying
 
01:41:05.109 --> 01:41:05.119 align:start position:0%
um the um i
 
01:41:09.109 --> 01:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
for the context of the committee um
 
01:41:11.910 --> 01:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
to what extent people often uh too often
 
01:41:13.590 --> 01:41:13.600 align:start position:0%
equate the community college system in
 
01:41:15.830 --> 01:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
your university system in terms of share
 
01:41:17.270 --> 01:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
of state funding
 
01:41:19.350 --> 01:41:19.360 align:start position:0%
how what percentage of your capital
 
01:41:21.669 --> 01:41:21.679 align:start position:0%
program in a given year
 
01:41:25.830 --> 01:41:25.840 align:start position:0%
does the state capital project represent
 
01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:30.390 align:start position:0%
does the state capital project represent
ballpark

01:41:30.390 --> 01:41:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:31.990 --> 01:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
do you mean compared to our operating
 
01:41:34.149 --> 01:41:34.159 align:start position:0%
budget no let's let's say like what's
 
01:41:36.390 --> 01:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
your your total capital funds is is the
 
01:41:38.629 --> 01:41:38.639 align:start position:0%
state share is the state capital
 
01:41:38.639 --> 01:41:39.910 align:start position:0%
state share is the state capital
appropriation

01:41:39.910 --> 01:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
01:41:41.669 --> 01:41:41.679 align:start position:0%
all of the capital investment you make
 
01:41:43.430 --> 01:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
or is it 10 of your total capital
 
01:41:43.440 --> 01:41:45.270 align:start position:0%
or is it 10 of your total capital
investment

01:41:45.270 --> 01:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
investment
 
01:41:47.430 --> 01:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
in a given year it's the majority of it
 
01:41:49.910 --> 01:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
um as the chancellor mentioned earlier
 
01:41:52.149 --> 01:41:52.159 align:start position:0%
we do seek other
 
01:41:54.709 --> 01:41:54.719 align:start position:0%
funds from eversource
 
01:41:57.350 --> 01:41:57.360 align:start position:0%
and we have donations as he's mentioned
 
01:41:57.360 --> 01:41:58.070 align:start position:0%
and we have donations as he's mentioned
but

01:41:58.070 --> 01:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:42:00.709 --> 01:42:00.719 align:start position:0%
it's a small push percentage but our we
 
01:42:00.719 --> 01:42:01.669 align:start position:0%
it's a small push percentage but our we
do

01:42:01.669 --> 01:42:01.679 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:42:03.669 --> 01:42:03.679 align:start position:0%
put quite a few of our operating funds
 
01:42:03.679 --> 01:42:05.189 align:start position:0%
put quite a few of our operating funds
into

01:42:05.189 --> 01:42:05.199 align:start position:0%
into
 
01:42:07.510 --> 01:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
you know repairs we've got
 
01:42:10.310 --> 01:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
our culinary program at lakes region for
 
01:42:12.470 --> 01:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
instance was done through grants and
 
01:42:15.430 --> 01:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
donations we didn't even get any capital
 
01:42:17.910 --> 01:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
dollars for that but it's it's a small
 
01:42:19.669 --> 01:42:19.679 align:start position:0%
amount but it's
 
01:42:22.310 --> 01:42:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:24.470 --> 01:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
the opportunity at that in that case to
 
01:42:26.470 --> 01:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
move an off-site
 
01:42:29.030 --> 01:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
culinary program to be on site
 
01:42:30.870 --> 01:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to point out for the for
 
01:42:32.870 --> 01:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
the benefit of everybody here that the
 
01:42:34.470 --> 01:42:34.480 align:start position:0%
you know the university system has a
 
01:42:36.629 --> 01:42:36.639 align:start position:0%
large capital program and the state is a
 
01:42:38.070 --> 01:42:38.080 align:start position:0%
small bit of it
 
01:42:41.109 --> 01:42:41.119 align:start position:0%
for the community college system um
 
01:42:50.629 --> 01:42:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:50.639 --> 01:42:52.310 align:start position:0%
 
questions

01:42:52.310 --> 01:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:42:54.870 --> 01:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
so i'm looking at your at your handout
 
01:42:54.880 --> 01:42:57.109 align:start position:0%
so i'm looking at your at your handout
um

01:42:57.109 --> 01:42:57.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:59.030 --> 01:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
you have a detail page
 
01:43:01.109 --> 01:43:01.119 align:start position:0%
i think it's like page nine
 
01:43:03.669 --> 01:43:03.679 align:start position:0%
that that says year twenty four twenty
 
01:43:05.910 --> 01:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
five nineteen million one hundred
 
01:43:08.709 --> 01:43:08.719 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for a total
 
01:43:09.750 --> 01:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:43:11.750 --> 01:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
a little bit further on there's an
 
01:43:11.760 --> 01:43:13.510 align:start position:0%
a little bit further on there's an
appendix

01:43:13.510 --> 01:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
appendix
 
01:43:17.030 --> 01:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
and it lists specific projects which
 
01:43:18.870 --> 01:43:18.880 align:start position:0%
total out to be
 
01:43:21.750 --> 01:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
three million one hundred fifty thousand
 
01:43:23.750 --> 01:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
is the three million one hundred fifty
 
01:43:25.830 --> 01:43:25.840 align:start position:0%
thousand your request for
 
01:43:25.840 --> 01:43:27.510 align:start position:0%
thousand your request for
this

01:43:27.510 --> 01:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:43:30.149 --> 01:43:30.159 align:start position:0%
capital budget biennium
 
01:43:32.470 --> 01:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
no this is the the
 
01:43:34.950 --> 01:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
the appendix with detail is the critical
 
01:43:37.430 --> 01:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
maintenance it's a subset specifically
 
01:43:39.910 --> 01:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
of of i want to say smaller projects but
 
01:43:42.149 --> 01:43:42.159 align:start position:0%
in some cases they're relatively large
 
01:43:44.709 --> 01:43:44.719 align:start position:0%
but it's just a subset of the total okay
 
01:43:46.470 --> 01:43:46.480 align:start position:0%
so it's a subset
 
01:43:48.390 --> 01:43:48.400 align:start position:0%
if you will of the nineteen million one
 
01:43:50.950 --> 01:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars
 
01:43:55.030 --> 01:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
yes uh it's line one of the first page
 
01:43:56.950 --> 01:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
nine that you referred to
 
01:44:01.270 --> 01:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
um top line um for 24.25 so it's

over to tom i want to provide some
 
01:46:14.950 --> 01:46:14.960 align:start position:0%
general context
 
01:46:16.709 --> 01:46:16.719 align:start position:0%
our capital budget
 
01:46:18.790 --> 01:46:18.800 align:start position:0%
needs address the increasing demand for
 
01:46:20.709 --> 01:46:20.719 align:start position:0%
outdoor experiences as you know new
 
01:46:22.229 --> 01:46:22.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire is a state position to
 
01:46:24.070 --> 01:46:24.080 align:start position:0%
accommodate such demand with a wide
 
01:46:27.990 --> 01:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
variety of experiences within proximity
 
01:46:29.750 --> 01:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
we are not going to be able to sustain
 
01:46:31.750 --> 01:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
the level of safety cleanliness and
 
01:46:33.750 --> 01:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
accessibility without strategic and
 
01:46:36.870 --> 01:46:36.880 align:start position:0%
consistent investment in our 200 to 300
 
01:46:39.750 --> 01:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
million dollars worth of infrastructure
 
01:46:41.669 --> 01:46:41.679 align:start position:0%
these investments make impacts beyond
 
01:46:43.910 --> 01:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
state park boundaries host communities
 
01:46:45.990 --> 01:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
see our parks as an asset partner
 
01:46:48.550 --> 01:46:48.560 align:start position:0%
organizations thrive when we thrive and
 
01:46:50.550 --> 01:46:50.560 align:start position:0%
the state's overall tourism industry
 
01:46:53.030 --> 01:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
benefits when state parks are clean safe
 
01:46:55.189 --> 01:46:55.199 align:start position:0%
available and accessible
 
01:46:57.109 --> 01:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
as an indication of demand the new
 
01:47:00.790 --> 01:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire state park system offers 1419
 
01:47:03.830 --> 01:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
campsites in 23 campgrounds and we are
 
01:47:07.590 --> 01:47:07.600 align:start position:0%
fully occupied on weekends and holidays
 
01:47:09.830 --> 01:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
i also want to remind folks that it was
 
01:47:12.629 --> 01:47:12.639 align:start position:0%
in 1977 when legislation was passed to
 
01:47:15.270 --> 01:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
fund a tram replacement project
 
01:47:18.149 --> 01:47:18.159 align:start position:0%
since then tram 2 has transported nearly
 
01:47:20.550 --> 01:47:20.560 align:start position:0%
10 million passengers and this tram has
 
01:47:22.390 --> 01:47:22.400 align:start position:0%
served the state well and is now it is
 
01:47:25.430 --> 01:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
now time to consider its future
 
01:47:27.270 --> 01:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
we have also added a request from the
 
01:47:29.350 --> 01:47:29.360 align:start position:0%
mount washington advisory commission
 
01:47:31.669 --> 01:47:31.679 align:start position:0%
which has a draft master plan in the
 
01:47:31.679 --> 01:47:32.629 align:start position:0%
which has a draft master plan in the
works

01:47:32.629 --> 01:47:32.639 align:start position:0%
works
 
01:47:34.709 --> 01:47:34.719 align:start position:0%
this will be the first completed master
 
01:47:37.270 --> 01:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
plan since 1970 and the commission
 
01:47:39.350 --> 01:47:39.360 align:start position:0%
strongly believes an environmental and
 
01:47:41.510 --> 01:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
infrastructure assessment at the summit
 
01:47:43.350 --> 01:47:43.360 align:start position:0%
is imperative in order to make sound
 
01:47:45.510 --> 01:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
decisions about future development
 
01:47:47.590 --> 01:47:47.600 align:start position:0%

washington
 
01:47:51.109 --> 01:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
turning to our forest and lands
 
01:47:53.030 --> 01:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
priorities the state the new hampshire
 
01:47:54.550 --> 01:47:54.560 align:start position:0%
state forest nursery had a
 
01:47:56.550 --> 01:47:56.560 align:start position:0%
record-breaking sale season for the
 
01:47:59.109 --> 01:47:59.119 align:start position:0%
third consecutive year this spring
 
01:48:03.030 --> 01:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
2022 saw a 67 increase in sales over
 
01:48:06.310 --> 01:48:06.320 align:start position:0%
2021 and a 73 increase in number of
 
01:48:08.070 --> 01:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
customers utilizing the new hampshire
 
01:48:10.070 --> 01:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
state forest nursery
 
01:48:12.390 --> 01:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
over a five-year span the nursery sales
 
01:48:16.310 --> 01:48:16.320 align:start position:0%
have increased by over 239 percent
 
01:48:18.229 --> 01:48:18.239 align:start position:0%
in this capital budget request we lay
 
01:48:19.750 --> 01:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
out several opportunities to get our
 
01:48:21.590 --> 01:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
forest and lands infrastructure up to
 
01:48:23.510 --> 01:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
date and efficient in order to sustain
 
01:48:26.550 --> 01:48:26.560 align:start position:0%
this growth well into the future
 
01:48:27.750 --> 01:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
i would like to take a moment to
 
01:48:29.430 --> 01:48:29.440 align:start position:0%
acknowledge the ongoing support from
 
01:48:31.910 --> 01:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
this administration for all five of our
 
01:48:33.990 --> 01:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
divisions as we have endured a few
 
01:48:36.070 --> 01:48:36.080 align:start position:0%
roller coaster years with covid we would
 
01:48:38.149 --> 01:48:38.159 align:start position:0%
not be in as strong a position as a
 
01:48:39.590 --> 01:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
department to provide the array of
 
01:48:42.149 --> 01:48:42.159 align:start position:0%
constituent services that we do without
 
01:48:44.470 --> 01:48:44.480 align:start position:0%
your recognition of the impact we make
 
01:48:46.870 --> 01:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
on communities throughout the state
 
01:48:48.470 --> 01:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
and now i'll turn it to tom to walk you
 
01:48:53.350 --> 01:48:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:54.950 --> 01:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning
 
01:48:57.030 --> 01:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
our five capital budget
 
01:48:59.189 --> 01:48:59.199 align:start position:0%
item requests are as follows
 
01:49:01.430 --> 01:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
the first one in our top priority is
 
01:49:03.189 --> 01:49:03.199 align:start position:0%
category we call roofing and repairs
 
01:49:04.629 --> 01:49:04.639 align:start position:0%
we've been privileged to receive money
 
01:49:06.149 --> 01:49:06.159 align:start position:0%
in this category
 
01:49:08.149 --> 01:49:08.159 align:start position:0%
for at least six bienniums that i'm
 
01:49:10.390 --> 01:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
aware of it's a category that covers
 
01:49:12.229 --> 01:49:12.239 align:start position:0%
roofing repairs and deferred maintenance
 
01:49:13.750 --> 01:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
projects that are required to keep the
 
01:49:17.189 --> 01:49:17.199 align:start position:0%
parks and other dncr facilities
 
01:49:19.589 --> 01:49:19.599 align:start position:0%
operating and providing services
 
01:49:21.430 --> 01:49:21.440 align:start position:0%
it provides a source of funding to allow
 
01:49:23.430 --> 01:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
the department to respond to critical
 
01:49:26.070 --> 01:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
facilities failures this is things like
 
01:49:28.229 --> 01:49:28.239 align:start position:0%
water pump failures or septic pump
 
01:49:30.390 --> 01:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
failures or storm damage
 
01:49:31.669 --> 01:49:31.679 align:start position:0%
i remember in
 
01:49:34.070 --> 01:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
2016 we had a storm in april that tore
 
01:49:37.270 --> 01:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
up the paving at north hampton beach
 
01:49:38.950 --> 01:49:38.960 align:start position:0%
because we had this funding in place we
 
01:49:40.310 --> 01:49:40.320 align:start position:0%
were able to have the parking lot
 
01:49:41.990 --> 01:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
repaired and operational in time for
 
01:49:43.270 --> 01:49:43.280 align:start position:0%
memorial day
 
01:49:44.870 --> 01:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
so it's very important to us from that
 
01:49:44.880 --> 01:49:46.470 align:start position:0%
so it's very important to us from that
respect

01:49:46.470 --> 01:49:46.480 align:start position:0%
respect
 
01:49:48.629 --> 01:49:48.639 align:start position:0%
the roofing component of the of the
 
01:49:48.639 --> 01:49:49.669 align:start position:0%
the roofing component of the of the
project

01:49:49.669 --> 01:49:49.679 align:start position:0%
project
 
01:49:51.430 --> 01:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
is something we've been working on for
 
01:49:54.550 --> 01:49:54.560 align:start position:0%
years and it's going very successfully
 
01:49:55.910 --> 01:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
we're catching up on deferred
 
01:49:57.669 --> 01:49:57.679 align:start position:0%
maintenance and the roofing
 
01:49:59.109 --> 01:49:59.119 align:start position:0%
this proposal
 
01:50:02.310 --> 01:50:02.320 align:start position:0%
uh outlines work for approximately 350
 
01:50:02.320 --> 01:50:03.270 align:start position:0%
uh outlines work for approximately 350
000

01:50:03.270 --> 01:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
000
 
01:50:06.390 --> 01:50:06.400 align:start position:0%
worth of roofing it would re-roof
 
01:50:08.470 --> 01:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
something in the order of 80 structures
 
01:50:11.109 --> 01:50:11.119 align:start position:0%
in our park system and those structures
 
01:50:11.119 --> 01:50:12.390 align:start position:0%
in our park system and those structures
be

01:50:12.390 --> 01:50:12.400 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:50:13.830 --> 01:50:13.840 align:start position:0%
picked through our scheduled maintenance
 
01:50:16.229 --> 01:50:16.239 align:start position:0%
program we have a database which we call
 
01:50:18.629 --> 01:50:18.639 align:start position:0%
fixed asset resource management system
 
01:50:19.830 --> 01:50:19.840 align:start position:0%
or farms
 
01:50:22.149 --> 01:50:22.159 align:start position:0%
and we assess the roofs and so we can
 
01:50:24.149 --> 01:50:24.159 align:start position:0%
predict when we think roofs are ready to
 
01:50:27.189 --> 01:50:27.199 align:start position:0%
be repaired so this this would continue
 
01:50:29.350 --> 01:50:29.360 align:start position:0%
our program there
 
01:50:31.189 --> 01:50:31.199 align:start position:0%
a very significant way
 
01:50:33.109 --> 01:50:33.119 align:start position:0%
the repairs uh
 
01:50:34.709 --> 01:50:34.719 align:start position:0%
part of the of the
 
01:50:37.430 --> 01:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
request there are there is a list of
 
01:50:39.189 --> 01:50:39.199 align:start position:0%
projects which we have included in your
 
01:50:39.199 --> 01:50:40.070 align:start position:0%
projects which we have included in your
packet

01:50:40.070 --> 01:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
packet
 
01:50:41.589 --> 01:50:41.599 align:start position:0%
and these are representative of the type
 
01:50:43.270 --> 01:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
of projects that we'd be doing for
 
01:50:46.790 --> 01:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
repairs and upgrades and and fire safety
 
01:50:48.390 --> 01:50:48.400 align:start position:0%
throughout the park system
 
01:50:50.229 --> 01:50:50.239 align:start position:0%
we do want to point out that we need the
 
01:50:52.310 --> 01:50:52.320 align:start position:0%
flexibility to respond to emergencies as
 
01:50:54.470 --> 01:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
they arrived so we would anticipate that
 
01:50:55.750 --> 01:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
there would be some revisions and
 
01:50:57.990 --> 01:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
substitutions to that list as we go
 
01:51:00.229 --> 01:51:00.239 align:start position:0%
through the biennium
 
01:51:03.589 --> 01:51:03.599 align:start position:0%
so that's item number one
 
01:51:05.830 --> 01:51:05.840 align:start position:0%
our second priority is for
 
01:51:08.070 --> 01:51:08.080 align:start position:0%
forest and lands facilities
 
01:51:10.149 --> 01:51:10.159 align:start position:0%
this request addresses again deferred
 
01:51:12.149 --> 01:51:12.159 align:start position:0%
maintenance facility upgrades and fire
 
01:51:14.149 --> 01:51:14.159 align:start position:0%
safety improvements at five of the
 
01:51:16.709 --> 01:51:16.719 align:start position:0%
division of forest and lands facilities
 
01:51:18.790 --> 01:51:18.800 align:start position:0%
the most prominent in that group is the
 
01:51:22.070 --> 01:51:22.080 align:start position:0%
state forest nursery in bosquen
 
01:51:23.910 --> 01:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
you just heard the commissioner tell you
 
01:51:25.350 --> 01:51:25.360 align:start position:0%
that the demand
 
01:51:27.669 --> 01:51:27.679 align:start position:0%
for the nursery for their seedlings has
 
01:51:29.990 --> 01:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
gone up significantly
 
01:51:32.229 --> 01:51:32.239 align:start position:0%
and their program needs some help and
 
01:51:33.830 --> 01:51:33.840 align:start position:0%
particularly in the
 
01:51:36.790 --> 01:51:36.800 align:start position:0%
seedling cooler facility seedlings need
 
01:51:39.270 --> 01:51:39.280 align:start position:0%
to be kept in a refrigerated building
 
01:51:40.870 --> 01:51:40.880 align:start position:0%
currently we have a
 
01:51:42.709 --> 01:51:42.719 align:start position:0%
lean-to type building off the existing
 
01:51:44.310 --> 01:51:44.320 align:start position:0%
main barn
 
01:51:46.470 --> 01:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
it's got structural problems
 
01:51:49.350 --> 01:51:49.360 align:start position:0%
so what we would like to do is
 
01:51:51.270 --> 01:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
replace that lean-to
 
01:51:53.030 --> 01:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
to the barn with a new refrigerated
 
01:51:55.189 --> 01:51:55.199 align:start position:0%
facilities refrigerated buildings have
 
01:51:56.950 --> 01:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
taken huge steps forward so there'll be
 
01:51:59.109 --> 01:51:59.119 align:start position:0%
a lot of energy savings in it we need
 
01:52:02.229 --> 01:52:02.239 align:start position:0%
about four thousand square feet of space
 
01:52:04.709 --> 01:52:04.719 align:start position:0%
uh we would gain back 2000 feet in the
 
01:52:06.629 --> 01:52:06.639 align:start position:0%
barn which then can be repurposed for
 
01:52:08.709 --> 01:52:08.719 align:start position:0%
seedling sorting and shipping so it'll
 
01:52:09.669 --> 01:52:09.679 align:start position:0%
be a big
 
01:52:11.669 --> 01:52:11.679 align:start position:0%
gain there
 
01:52:14.229 --> 01:52:14.239 align:start position:0%
the other areas where we
 
01:52:16.870 --> 01:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
are asking for funds for forests and
 
01:52:19.669 --> 01:52:19.679 align:start position:0%

01:52:21.510 --> 01:52:21.520 align:start position:0%

01:52:31.910 --> 01:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
our third request uh it
 
01:52:33.750 --> 01:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
is a big and important one to us it's
 
01:52:36.470 --> 01:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
the canon mountain tramway replacement
 
01:52:36.480 --> 01:52:38.149 align:start position:0%
the canon mountain tramway replacement
of

01:52:38.149 --> 01:52:38.159 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:52:40.229 --> 01:52:40.239 align:start position:0%
that item number three and item number
 
01:52:42.629 --> 01:52:42.639 align:start position:0%
four ideally we would do as a pair but
 
01:52:45.589 --> 01:52:45.599 align:start position:0%
we broke them out in case
 
01:52:47.510 --> 01:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
the funding could only come at us and
 
01:52:50.470 --> 01:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
bunches but the situation is that the
 
01:52:52.390 --> 01:52:52.400 align:start position:0%
cannon mountain aerial tramway is
 
01:52:55.109 --> 01:52:55.119 align:start position:0%
reaching the end of its service life
 
01:52:57.270 --> 01:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
the one that we are operating with now
 
01:53:01.910 --> 01:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:03.669 --> 01:53:03.679 align:start position:0%
the tramway aerial lift is important
 
01:53:05.750 --> 01:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
because not only is it a ski lift in the
 
01:53:07.910 --> 01:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
winter time supplementing on weekends
 
01:53:09.109 --> 01:53:09.119 align:start position:0%
the busiest weekends that will
 
01:53:10.629 --> 01:53:10.639 align:start position:0%
supplement the skiers that can come up
 
01:53:12.950 --> 01:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
on the regular lifts but through the
 
01:53:14.550 --> 01:53:14.560 align:start position:0%
spring and fall it's a major tourist
 
01:53:17.189 --> 01:53:17.199 align:start position:0%
attraction in the white mountain area
 
01:53:17.199 --> 01:53:20.310 align:start position:0%
attraction in the white mountain area
and

01:53:20.310 --> 01:53:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:21.510 --> 01:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
it takes in
 
01:53:23.750 --> 01:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
about a hundred thousand riders in a
 
01:53:23.760 --> 01:53:25.109 align:start position:0%
about a hundred thousand riders in a
season

01:53:25.109 --> 01:53:25.119 align:start position:0%
season
 
01:53:27.350 --> 01:53:27.360 align:start position:0%
recently brought in 1.8 million dollars
 
01:53:27.360 --> 01:53:28.149 align:start position:0%
recently brought in 1.8 million dollars
in

01:53:28.149 --> 01:53:28.159 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:53:32.470 --> 01:53:32.480 align:start position:0%
ticket sales and associated retail sales
 
01:53:34.149 --> 01:53:34.159 align:start position:0%
so it's important to us from that point
 
01:53:35.510 --> 01:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
of view but also
 
01:53:37.430 --> 01:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
we feel that it does attract tourists to
 
01:53:38.709 --> 01:53:38.719 align:start position:0%
the area and helps all the other
 
01:53:41.750 --> 01:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
businesses in the north country
 
01:53:43.669 --> 01:53:43.679 align:start position:0%
now the the company we've been working
 
01:53:45.510 --> 01:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
with on maintaining the tramway is the
 
01:53:48.070 --> 01:53:48.080 align:start position:0%
doppelmeyer company
 
01:53:49.510 --> 01:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
and they've given us a pretty dire
 
01:53:49.520 --> 01:53:50.550 align:start position:0%
and they've given us a pretty dire
report

01:53:50.550 --> 01:53:50.560 align:start position:0%
report
 
01:53:52.629 --> 01:53:52.639 align:start position:0%
about the current tramway
 
01:53:54.470 --> 01:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
the tram cars or cabins as i like to
 
01:53:55.990 --> 01:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
call them are
 
01:53:58.390 --> 01:53:58.400 align:start position:0%
pretty much just physically worn out
 
01:54:00.310 --> 01:54:00.320 align:start position:0%
the cabins are supported from the cable
 
01:54:03.109 --> 01:54:03.119 align:start position:0%
by a carriage which is a steel arm and
 
01:54:04.629 --> 01:54:04.639 align:start position:0%
those steel arms
 
01:54:06.070 --> 01:54:06.080 align:start position:0%
they have to
 
01:54:08.390 --> 01:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
support a lot of weight and and pretty
 
01:54:10.229 --> 01:54:10.239 align:start position:0%
severe weather conditions they have a
 
01:54:12.709 --> 01:54:12.719 align:start position:0%
life expectancy we're within three years
 
01:54:15.109 --> 01:54:15.119 align:start position:0%
of the life expectancy of our carriage
 
01:54:15.119 --> 01:54:16.709 align:start position:0%
of the life expectancy of our carriage
arms

01:54:16.709 --> 01:54:16.719 align:start position:0%
arms
 
01:54:19.510 --> 01:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
the uh the gearboxes
 
01:54:21.510 --> 01:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
uh and the motors that run the whole
 
01:54:21.520 --> 01:54:23.030 align:start position:0%
uh and the motors that run the whole
assembly

01:54:23.030 --> 01:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
assembly
 
01:54:23.040 --> 01:54:23.910 align:start position:0%
assembly
are

01:54:23.910 --> 01:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:54:25.510 --> 01:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
essentially obsolete the company that
 
01:54:26.950 --> 01:54:26.960 align:start position:0%
provided them for us is no longer in
 
01:54:28.229 --> 01:54:28.239 align:start position:0%
business so
 
01:54:29.830 --> 01:54:29.840 align:start position:0%
replacing them in kind is not a
 
01:54:31.669 --> 01:54:31.679 align:start position:0%
possibility for us
 
01:54:31.679 --> 01:54:32.709 align:start position:0%
possibility for us
and

01:54:32.709 --> 01:54:32.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:54:32.719 --> 01:54:33.430 align:start position:0%
and
the

01:54:33.430 --> 01:54:33.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:54:35.510 --> 01:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
elect electronic controls that operate
 
01:54:36.629 --> 01:54:36.639 align:start position:0%
the system
 
01:54:38.870 --> 01:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
they were put in in the late 70s and
 
01:54:40.790 --> 01:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
they run on floppy disks
 
01:54:40.800 --> 01:54:41.910 align:start position:0%
they run on floppy disks
so

01:54:41.910 --> 01:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:54:43.669 --> 01:54:43.679 align:start position:0%
we're in a situation where we're really
 
01:54:45.669 --> 01:54:45.679 align:start position:0%
pushing the lifetime
 
01:54:47.669 --> 01:54:47.679 align:start position:0%
there is that safety concern about the
 
01:54:50.629 --> 01:54:50.639 align:start position:0%
arms in a new hampshire tramway safety
 
01:54:52.790 --> 01:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
board has to certify us every year for
 
01:54:54.950 --> 01:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
safety and at some point they may not be
 
01:54:57.430 --> 01:54:57.440 align:start position:0%
able to do that so we'd like to be well
 
01:55:02.149 --> 01:55:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:05.750 --> 01:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
so uh the the fourth request which ties
 
01:55:08.709 --> 01:55:08.719 align:start position:0%
into this is renovation of the the two
 
01:55:11.510 --> 01:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
lodges that serve the tramway the valley
 
01:55:13.750 --> 01:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
station at the base where passengers
 
01:55:16.310 --> 01:55:16.320 align:start position:0%
come in get oriented buy their tickets
 
01:55:17.589 --> 01:55:17.599 align:start position:0%
and get on
 
01:55:19.430 --> 01:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
and the mountain station on the summit
 
01:55:21.510 --> 01:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
which receives passengers
 
01:55:24.709 --> 01:55:24.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:28.390 --> 01:55:28.400 align:start position:0%
last majorly renovated in the 1980s when
 
01:55:30.149 --> 01:55:30.159 align:start position:0%
the new tramway opened up
 
01:55:31.910 --> 01:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
there have been some small renovations
 
01:55:34.310 --> 01:55:34.320 align:start position:0%
since then but basically
 
01:55:36.470 --> 01:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh it's looking pretty old
 
01:55:39.990 --> 01:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
and charitably you could call us retro
 
01:55:41.669 --> 01:55:41.679 align:start position:0%
uh unchartedly you could say we're
 
01:55:41.679 --> 01:55:42.790 align:start position:0%
uh unchartedly you could say we're
shabby

01:55:42.790 --> 01:55:42.800 align:start position:0%
shabby
 
01:55:45.270 --> 01:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
it's it's that situation this there's
 
01:55:46.950 --> 01:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
three aspects to what we need to do to
 
01:55:48.790 --> 01:55:48.800 align:start position:0%
these buildings
 
01:55:50.709 --> 01:55:50.719 align:start position:0%
one of them is the exterior envelope we
 
01:55:52.390 --> 01:55:52.400 align:start position:0%
need upgrades there
 
01:55:54.229 --> 01:55:54.239 align:start position:0%
fortunately with the roofing funds we
 
01:55:56.390 --> 01:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
have the roofs under control but the
 
01:55:58.470 --> 01:55:58.480 align:start position:0%
siding the windows the exterior trim and
 
01:56:00.870 --> 01:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
the doors those are all parts of these
 
01:56:02.790 --> 01:56:02.800 align:start position:0%
buildings that need to be repaired
 
01:56:05.109 --> 01:56:05.119 align:start position:0%
and upgraded
 
01:56:07.109 --> 01:56:07.119 align:start position:0%
we have a life safety concern in these
 
01:56:07.119 --> 01:56:08.149 align:start position:0%
we have a life safety concern in these
buildings

01:56:08.149 --> 01:56:08.159 align:start position:0%
buildings
 
01:56:08.159 --> 01:56:09.510 align:start position:0%
buildings
because

01:56:09.510 --> 01:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:56:11.830 --> 01:56:11.840 align:start position:0%
they actually both stretch back to the
 
01:56:14.550 --> 01:56:14.560 align:start position:0%
1930s for the first tramway and they had
 
01:56:16.629 --> 01:56:16.639 align:start position:0%
been renovated and added on to
 
01:56:18.229 --> 01:56:18.239 align:start position:0%
the state fire marshal and their annual
 
01:56:19.910 --> 01:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
inspections have pointed out to us that
 
01:56:22.950 --> 01:56:22.960 align:start position:0%
it's time to really get the egress roots
 
01:56:25.189 --> 01:56:25.199 align:start position:0%
clearly defined the fire separation
 
01:56:27.830 --> 01:56:27.840 align:start position:0%
walls up to snuff we need to do that
 
01:56:30.070 --> 01:56:30.080 align:start position:0%
that work too so we have the exterior
 
01:56:31.990 --> 01:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
envelope the interior
 
01:56:33.830 --> 01:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
renovations for presentation to the
 
01:56:36.390 --> 01:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
public and life safety
 
01:56:38.070 --> 01:56:38.080 align:start position:0%
we'd love to do this together with the
 
01:56:40.950 --> 01:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
tramway project and have a complete
 
01:56:42.550 --> 01:56:42.560 align:start position:0%
renovated tramway to present to the
 
01:56:42.560 --> 01:56:45.430 align:start position:0%
renovated tramway to present to the
public

01:56:45.430 --> 01:56:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:45.440 --> 01:56:46.390 align:start position:0%
 
finally

01:56:46.390 --> 01:56:46.400 align:start position:0%
finally
 
01:56:48.629 --> 01:56:48.639 align:start position:0%
our fifth item
 
01:56:50.790 --> 01:56:50.800 align:start position:0%
was not on our original capital budget
 
01:56:52.790 --> 01:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
request but we have added it at the
 
01:56:54.830 --> 01:56:54.840 align:start position:0%
request of the mount washington advisory
 
01:56:56.709 --> 01:56:56.719 align:start position:0%
commission the commission has been
 
01:56:58.470 --> 01:56:58.480 align:start position:0%
working on a master plan for the summit
 
01:57:00.790 --> 01:57:00.800 align:start position:0%
of mount washington
 
01:57:03.109 --> 01:57:03.119 align:start position:0%
we know that use of the summit has been
 
01:57:04.470 --> 01:57:04.480 align:start position:0%
going up
 
01:57:07.189 --> 01:57:07.199 align:start position:0%
and planning for it it's become apparent
 
01:57:08.790 --> 01:57:08.800 align:start position:0%
to make good decisions about planning
 
01:57:11.510 --> 01:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
for that we need some real solid
 
01:57:13.350 --> 01:57:13.360 align:start position:0%
information so we're looking for an
 
01:57:15.350 --> 01:57:15.360 align:start position:0%
assessment that includes environmental
 
01:57:18.870 --> 01:57:18.880 align:start position:0%
concerns and infrastructure concerns
 
01:57:21.030 --> 01:57:21.040 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure ranges from water
 
01:57:23.109 --> 01:57:23.119 align:start position:0%
supply at the summit
 
01:57:24.790 --> 01:57:24.800 align:start position:0%
to the building the space that we have
 
01:57:27.910 --> 01:57:27.920 align:start position:0%
on the summit do we have enough shelter
 
01:57:30.310 --> 01:57:30.320 align:start position:0%
to protect people in a severe weather
 
01:57:30.320 --> 01:57:31.510 align:start position:0%
to protect people in a severe weather
situation

01:57:31.510 --> 01:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:57:32.790 --> 01:57:32.800 align:start position:0%
which happens frequently and
 
01:57:34.149 --> 01:57:34.159 align:start position:0%
unexpectedly on the top of mount
 
01:57:35.910 --> 01:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
washington can we shelter everybody we
 
01:57:37.589 --> 01:57:37.599 align:start position:0%
brought to the summit
 
01:57:40.229 --> 01:57:40.239 align:start position:0%
what about communications facilities on
 
01:57:41.910 --> 01:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
the summit it's a major communication
 
01:57:41.920 --> 01:57:42.950 align:start position:0%
the summit it's a major communication
site

01:57:42.950 --> 01:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
site
 
01:57:45.830 --> 01:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
and there's a there's commercial users
 
01:57:47.990 --> 01:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
up there there are more commercial users
 
01:57:49.750 --> 01:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
that would like to be there but there's
 
01:57:51.750 --> 01:57:51.760 align:start position:0%
also public safety users
 
01:57:53.510 --> 01:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
there's the fbi in this homeland
 
01:57:56.390 --> 01:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
security and and they perfor provide
 
01:57:58.870 --> 01:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
real functions for public safety
 
01:57:58.880 --> 01:57:59.589 align:start position:0%
real functions for public safety
so

01:57:59.589 --> 01:57:59.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:58:01.669 --> 01:58:01.679 align:start position:0%
we need a coordinated look at that
 
01:58:03.510 --> 01:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
and all of that we hope would provide a
 
01:58:05.910 --> 01:58:05.920 align:start position:0%
foundation for future development plans
 
01:58:07.750 --> 01:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
considerations of the summit's carrying
 
01:58:09.750 --> 01:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
capacity and strategies
 
01:58:11.830 --> 01:58:11.840 align:start position:0%
for ecosystem conservation after all
 
01:58:14.310 --> 01:58:14.320 align:start position:0%
it's a it's an alpine ecosystem
 
01:58:15.990 --> 01:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
with certain fragility that we should be
 
01:58:18.229 --> 01:58:18.239 align:start position:0%
paying attention to
 
01:58:19.750 --> 01:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
so let's
 
01:58:22.149 --> 01:58:22.159 align:start position:0%
quick review of our five items
 
01:58:24.550 --> 01:58:24.560 align:start position:0%
and uh i will try to answer any
 
01:58:28.149 --> 01:58:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:28.159 --> 01:58:29.350 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:58:29.350 --> 01:58:29.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:58:31.510 --> 01:58:31.520 align:start position:0%
uh yeah i have a
 
01:58:34.550 --> 01:58:34.560 align:start position:0%
quick question hopefully uh from first i
 
01:58:36.229 --> 01:58:36.239 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that i'm understanding
 
01:58:37.750 --> 01:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
correctly it sounds like with the
 
01:58:39.750 --> 01:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
tramway particularly
 
01:58:41.189 --> 01:58:41.199 align:start position:0%
coming to the end of its useful life
 
01:58:43.910 --> 01:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
this isn't something you can be able to
 
01:58:45.669 --> 01:58:45.679 align:start position:0%
maintain your way through i mean we
 
01:58:47.109 --> 01:58:47.119 align:start position:0%
can't just give you a roll of duct tape
 
01:58:49.270 --> 01:58:49.280 align:start position:0%
and say fix it and you're good for
 
01:58:50.790 --> 01:58:50.800 align:start position:0%
another five years
 
01:58:52.629 --> 01:58:52.639 align:start position:0%
that it sounds like
 
01:58:55.430 --> 01:58:55.440 align:start position:0%
replace it or end it
 
01:58:56.470 --> 01:58:56.480 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:58:58.149 --> 01:58:58.159 align:start position:0%
correct i think that's the situation
 
01:58:59.189 --> 01:58:59.199 align:start position:0%
that we're in
 
01:59:01.030 --> 01:59:01.040 align:start position:0%
it's gonna we have to be extremely
 
01:59:02.390 --> 01:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
careful of course with something like
 
01:59:04.790 --> 01:59:04.800 align:start position:0%
this transporting the public
 
01:59:06.709 --> 01:59:06.719 align:start position:0%
so uh there's going to come a time when
 
01:59:08.310 --> 01:59:08.320 align:start position:0%
we have to say no
 
01:59:10.390 --> 01:59:10.400 align:start position:0%
the risk has gotten too great and unless
 
01:59:12.390 --> 01:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
you can make major changes we have to
 
01:59:13.910 --> 01:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
stop this and it would just be out of
 
01:59:15.430 --> 01:59:15.440 align:start position:0%
service at that point
 
01:59:17.109 --> 01:59:17.119 align:start position:0%
so i correct to say that
 
01:59:18.629 --> 01:59:18.639 align:start position:0%
your requests three and four go hand in
 
01:59:21.189 --> 01:59:21.199 align:start position:0%
hand that if if you don't get number
 
01:59:21.199 --> 01:59:22.149 align:start position:0%
hand that if if you don't get number
three

01:59:22.149 --> 01:59:22.159 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:59:24.470 --> 01:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
number four becomes
 
01:59:27.750 --> 01:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
fairly uh useless because you don't need
 
01:59:29.510 --> 01:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
to maintain the buildings if you don't
 
01:59:31.270 --> 01:59:31.280 align:start position:0%
have a tram i just want to assure you we
 
01:59:32.390 --> 01:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
take the money if you would give it to
 
01:59:32.400 --> 01:59:33.910 align:start position:0%
take the money if you would give it to
us

01:59:33.910 --> 01:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:59:36.070 --> 01:59:36.080 align:start position:0%
we could do the renovations but as you
 
01:59:38.790 --> 01:59:38.800 align:start position:0%
say if we can't go on with the tramway a
 
01:59:40.470 --> 01:59:40.480 align:start position:0%
major point of it
 
01:59:41.830 --> 01:59:41.840 align:start position:0%
is taken away
 
01:59:43.510 --> 01:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
i would like to add that at least the
 
01:59:46.229 --> 01:59:46.239 align:start position:0%
base building is part of our summer and
 
01:59:48.229 --> 01:59:48.239 align:start position:0%
fall visitor experience even if they
 
01:59:50.470 --> 01:59:50.480 align:start position:0%
don't ride the tram so there's bathrooms
 
01:59:51.669 --> 01:59:51.679 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
01:59:54.229 --> 01:59:54.239 align:start position:0%
shop a gift shop there's concessions
 
01:59:57.430 --> 01:59:57.440 align:start position:0%
so i would want to consider
 
01:59:59.589 --> 01:59:59.599 align:start position:0%
the the maintenance of that
 
02:00:01.750 --> 02:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
piece of this regardless of what happens
 
02:00:04.149 --> 02:00:04.159 align:start position:0%
with the tram okay and
 
02:00:05.750 --> 02:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
now about the usage of the tram you you
 
02:00:08.070 --> 02:00:08.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned that it has fairly impressive
 
02:00:09.910 --> 02:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
ticket sales of over well over a million
 
02:00:09.920 --> 02:00:10.950 align:start position:0%
ticket sales of over well over a million
dollars

02:00:10.950 --> 02:00:10.960 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:00:13.830 --> 02:00:13.840 align:start position:0%
who uses the tram is it is it simply is
 
02:00:15.430 --> 02:00:15.440 align:start position:0%
it is it tourists that come into the
 
02:00:17.830 --> 02:00:17.840 align:start position:0%
state is it new hampshire residents is
 
02:00:19.669 --> 02:00:19.679 align:start position:0%
it skiers uh
 
02:00:21.350 --> 02:00:21.360 align:start position:0%
hikers can you go into that a little bit
 
02:00:23.270 --> 02:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
i'll touch on that and then if i missed
 
02:00:24.950 --> 02:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
something i would invite our parks
 
02:00:26.470 --> 02:00:26.480 align:start position:0%
director phil bryce who is here and has
 
02:00:27.669 --> 02:00:27.679 align:start position:0%
put a lot of
 
02:00:29.750 --> 02:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
mental capacity to these questions over
 
02:00:31.669 --> 02:00:31.679 align:start position:0%
the last few months um
 
02:00:33.589 --> 02:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
in the winter of course it's our skiers
 
02:00:37.270 --> 02:00:37.280 align:start position:0%
who um who value the tram but that is is
 
02:00:38.709 --> 02:00:38.719 align:start position:0%
canon mountain could operate without the
 
02:00:41.990 --> 02:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
tram in the winter that's the reality um
 
02:00:45.830 --> 02:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
the tram really serves as a um as a
 
02:00:47.990 --> 02:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
tourism um
 
02:00:50.709 --> 02:00:50.719 align:start position:0%
site for summer and fall there are bus
 
02:00:52.070 --> 02:00:52.080 align:start position:0%
groups that go on the tram the tram is
 
02:00:53.750 --> 02:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
not like a gondola or a lift right you
 
02:00:55.430 --> 02:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
can put a group of people on we have
 
02:00:57.350 --> 02:00:57.360 align:start position:0%
somebody in the tram who describes what
 
02:00:59.270 --> 02:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
you're looking at it's a it's a visitor
 
02:01:01.990 --> 02:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
experience and one that uh the area
 
02:01:04.070 --> 02:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
businesses hotels restaurants direct
 
02:01:05.189 --> 02:01:05.199 align:start position:0%
people to
 
02:01:06.790 --> 02:01:06.800 align:start position:0%
in this process we've talked to chambers
 
02:01:08.629 --> 02:01:08.639 align:start position:0%
of commerce for example
 
02:01:10.550 --> 02:01:10.560 align:start position:0%
that say that you know this is a feature
 
02:01:12.870 --> 02:01:12.880 align:start position:0%
that they that they point their visitors
 
02:01:14.229 --> 02:01:14.239 align:start position:0%
um to
 
02:01:16.390 --> 02:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
especially since the old man
 
02:01:19.030 --> 02:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
on the mountain collapsed sadly
 
02:01:20.950 --> 02:01:20.960 align:start position:0%
this has become
 
02:01:25.030 --> 02:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
a destination that people um continue to
 
02:01:27.189 --> 02:01:27.199 align:start position:0%
want to see we have the old man viewing
 
02:01:29.910 --> 02:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
area there um and so when we talk to
 
02:01:31.430 --> 02:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
chambers of commerce who are directing
 
02:01:33.189 --> 02:01:33.199 align:start position:0%
tourists from all over the world to
 
02:01:35.430 --> 02:01:35.440 align:start position:0%
franconia notch state park this is one
 
02:01:38.229 --> 02:01:38.239 align:start position:0%
of the things that they do um and so we
 
02:01:40.709 --> 02:01:40.719 align:start position:0%
have evidence from from the chambers
 
02:01:43.430 --> 02:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
that that this would be um a very uh
 
02:01:45.109 --> 02:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
missed experience that they have to
 
02:01:48.070 --> 02:01:48.080 align:start position:0%
offer their their guests and visitors um
 
02:01:50.470 --> 02:01:50.480 align:start position:0%
phil do you have any other points that
 
02:01:51.669 --> 02:01:51.679 align:start position:0%
you would want to include in this
 
02:01:51.679 --> 02:01:57.510 align:start position:0%
you would want to include in this
question

02:01:57.510 --> 02:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:59.109 --> 02:01:59.119 align:start position:0%
yeah why don't you move up to the table
 
02:01:59.119 --> 02:02:00.229 align:start position:0%
yeah why don't you move up to the table
please

02:02:00.229 --> 02:02:00.239 align:start position:0%
please
 
02:02:00.239 --> 02:02:03.430 align:start position:0%
please
okay

02:02:03.430 --> 02:02:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:05.510 --> 02:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
state um is ranked
 
02:02:08.070 --> 02:02:08.080 align:start position:0%
number two number 10
 
02:02:10.709 --> 02:02:10.719 align:start position:0%
in the top 10 parks in the u.s
 
02:02:13.189 --> 02:02:13.199 align:start position:0%
we see visitors from all over the world
 
02:02:15.750 --> 02:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
people up there go through the
 
02:02:19.189 --> 02:02:19.199 align:start position:0%
bloom for example i've been up there and
 
02:02:21.270 --> 02:02:21.280 align:start position:0%
there was all kinds of language being
 
02:02:24.070 --> 02:02:24.080 align:start position:0%
spoken by the people that were visiting
 
02:02:24.080 --> 02:02:25.030 align:start position:0%
spoken by the people that were visiting
so

02:02:25.030 --> 02:02:25.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:02:26.550 --> 02:02:26.560 align:start position:0%
of course we get a lot of people from
 
02:02:28.310 --> 02:02:28.320 align:start position:0%
massachusetts to come up in different
 
02:02:30.950 --> 02:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
tony notch but people who visit that
 
02:02:33.350 --> 02:02:33.360 align:start position:0%
site particularly with bus tours
 
02:02:39.750 --> 02:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:40.790 --> 02:02:40.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:02:44.070 --> 02:02:44.080 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
 
02:02:46.790 --> 02:02:46.800 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
02:02:50.310 --> 02:02:50.320 align:start position:0%
looking at your funding detail on the
 
02:02:52.229 --> 02:02:52.239 align:start position:0%
tramway and
 
02:02:54.790 --> 02:02:54.800 align:start position:0%
we heard this all two years ago with
 
02:02:59.270 --> 02:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
in the capital budget um but you're
 
02:03:01.430 --> 02:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
indicating that it's 100
 
02:03:03.350 --> 02:03:03.360 align:start position:0%
federally funded
 
02:03:05.990 --> 02:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
um in your funding detail
 
02:03:08.310 --> 02:03:08.320 align:start position:0%
um is that a true statement and if so
 
02:03:10.470 --> 02:03:10.480 align:start position:0%
where do the funds come from and if it's
 
02:03:12.709 --> 02:03:12.719 align:start position:0%
not true what is the funding detail
 
02:03:16.070 --> 02:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
thank you so over the last two years as
 
02:03:18.229 --> 02:03:18.239 align:start position:0%
we've been putting together our capital
 
02:03:21.830 --> 02:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
requests along with various arpa
 
02:03:24.709 --> 02:03:24.719 align:start position:0%
requests that went through gopher um
 
02:03:26.229 --> 02:03:26.239 align:start position:0%
we we have realized that there are
 
02:03:27.669 --> 02:03:27.679 align:start position:0%
several buckets of money and
 
02:03:29.270 --> 02:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
conversations that are happening about
 
02:03:31.350 --> 02:03:31.360 align:start position:0%
those buckets that we're not necessarily
 
02:03:34.229 --> 02:03:34.239 align:start position:0%
privy to so at one point
 
02:03:35.430 --> 02:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
we were
 
02:03:39.430 --> 02:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
listing the the federal uh category
 
02:03:41.270 --> 02:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
thinking that arpa would be an
 
02:03:43.669 --> 02:03:43.679 align:start position:0%
opportunity we have since revised and
 
02:03:45.350 --> 02:03:45.360 align:start position:0%
what we passed out today is the revision
 
02:03:48.709 --> 02:03:48.719 align:start position:0%
of the five priorities that um that inc
 
02:03:50.709 --> 02:03:50.719 align:start position:0%
that now
 
02:03:51.990 --> 02:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
it should have just been passed out
 
02:03:53.510 --> 02:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
before we spoke
 
02:03:53.520 --> 02:03:56.950 align:start position:0%
before we spoke
um

02:03:56.950 --> 02:03:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:58.229 --> 02:03:58.239 align:start position:0%
i will get you a copy because everyone
 
02:04:01.510 --> 02:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
else has one um but uh we've we've since
 
02:04:03.830 --> 02:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
been advised to change that so instead
 
02:04:05.910 --> 02:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
of listing it under federal we've been
 
02:04:07.669 --> 02:04:07.679 align:start position:0%
told to put it under our capital our
 
02:04:14.629 --> 02:04:14.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:17.109 --> 02:04:17.119 align:start position:0%
commissioner i i'm curious about the
 
02:04:19.430 --> 02:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
your revenue 1.8 million
 
02:04:21.750 --> 02:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
and that's just for the tram yes sir and
 
02:04:23.430 --> 02:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
that supports a lot of our other state
 
02:04:25.109 --> 02:04:25.119 align:start position:0%
parks because we are operationally
 
02:04:25.119 --> 02:04:26.950 align:start position:0%
parks because we are operationally
self-funded

02:04:26.950 --> 02:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
self-funded
 
02:04:29.430 --> 02:04:29.440 align:start position:0%
so the um
 
02:04:31.510 --> 02:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
people pay a fee to ride the tram and it
 
02:04:34.149 --> 02:04:34.159 align:start position:0%
totals 1.8 million a year
 
02:04:34.159 --> 02:04:35.669 align:start position:0%
totals 1.8 million a year
yes

02:04:35.669 --> 02:04:35.679 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:04:37.350 --> 02:04:37.360 align:start position:0%
that's pretty impressive associated
 
02:04:40.390 --> 02:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
retail sales food t-shirts
 
02:04:43.109 --> 02:04:43.119 align:start position:0%
associated retail sales also
 
02:04:44.629 --> 02:04:44.639 align:start position:0%
oh like i buy a t-shirt with a picture
 
02:04:45.910 --> 02:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
of the tram i don't know if that's a
 
02:04:45.920 --> 02:04:46.950 align:start position:0%
of the tram i don't know if that's a
thing

02:04:46.950 --> 02:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
thing
 
02:04:49.030 --> 02:04:49.040 align:start position:0%
could be
 
02:04:58.709 --> 02:04:58.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:58.719 --> 02:04:59.669 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

02:04:59.669 --> 02:04:59.679 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:05:01.189 --> 02:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
the question here is is it opera
 
02:05:01.199 --> 02:05:03.750 align:start position:0%
the question here is is it opera
eligible

02:05:03.750 --> 02:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:05.750 --> 02:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
is it arpa eligible i don't know if
 
02:05:07.189 --> 02:05:07.199 align:start position:0%
we're in a position to make that
 
02:05:07.199 --> 02:05:08.950 align:start position:0%
we're in a position to make that
determination

02:05:08.950 --> 02:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
determination
 
02:05:11.750 --> 02:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
we present things to gopher and we have
 
02:05:13.990 --> 02:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
been over the last year and then they
 
02:05:17.109 --> 02:05:17.119 align:start position:0%
they discern if if it's arpa eligible or
 
02:05:17.119 --> 02:05:18.470 align:start position:0%
they discern if if it's arpa eligible or
not

02:05:18.470 --> 02:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:05:18.480 --> 02:05:19.270 align:start position:0%
not
okay

02:05:19.270 --> 02:05:19.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:05:20.709 --> 02:05:20.719 align:start position:0%
i would suggest you talk to the
 
02:05:22.950 --> 02:05:22.960 align:start position:0%
governor's budget director
 
02:05:25.270 --> 02:05:25.280 align:start position:0%
and the governor about that because i
 
02:05:27.589 --> 02:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
know that outdoor recreation is part of
 
02:05:27.599 --> 02:05:28.629 align:start position:0%
know that outdoor recreation is part of
arpa

02:05:28.629 --> 02:05:28.639 align:start position:0%
arpa
 
02:05:28.639 --> 02:05:29.669 align:start position:0%
arpa
and

02:05:29.669 --> 02:05:29.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:05:32.709 --> 02:05:32.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:34.709 --> 02:05:34.719 align:start position:0%
that would be a better use
 
02:05:37.109 --> 02:05:37.119 align:start position:0%
for arpa funds than some of the other
 
02:05:39.910 --> 02:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
things that i've seen um and that's
 
02:05:42.229 --> 02:05:42.239 align:start position:0%
graham speaking not necessarily the
 
02:05:44.470 --> 02:05:44.480 align:start position:0%
legislature but
 
02:05:46.870 --> 02:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
it will be a hard sell to get
 
02:05:49.430 --> 02:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
you know 20 million dollars plus
 
02:05:52.390 --> 02:05:52.400 align:start position:0%
in a capital budget of 125
 
02:05:53.830 --> 02:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
plus or minus
 
02:05:56.790 --> 02:05:56.800 align:start position:0%
for tramway
 
02:05:56.800 --> 02:05:58.069 align:start position:0%
for tramway
okay

02:05:58.069 --> 02:05:58.079 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:05:59.510 --> 02:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
we can certainly have a discussion and
 
02:06:02.149 --> 02:06:02.159 align:start position:0%
i'll have discussions with gopher um
 
02:06:05.510 --> 02:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
very soon thank you about that thank you
 
02:06:08.069 --> 02:06:08.079 align:start position:0%
james i just had one question is for the
 
02:06:10.550 --> 02:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
tram would that be completed in that one
 
02:06:12.229 --> 02:06:12.239 align:start position:0%
bucket of money and during that time
 
02:06:14.950 --> 02:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
frame or is this a partial phase for the
 
02:06:18.310 --> 02:06:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:20.069 --> 02:06:20.079 align:start position:0%
uh it's not the kind of thing we can do
 
02:06:22.550 --> 02:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
in phases so it'll be trying to do the
 
02:06:24.550 --> 02:06:24.560 align:start position:0%
whole thing as quickly as possible and
 
02:06:26.790 --> 02:06:26.800 align:start position:0%
we think we can do it uh
 
02:06:34.709 --> 02:06:34.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:37.910 --> 02:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:39.830 --> 02:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
just one more because we have time
 
02:06:39.840 --> 02:06:41.189 align:start position:0%
just one more because we have time
um

02:06:41.189 --> 02:06:41.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:43.750 --> 02:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
the state nursery is that self-funded
 
02:06:46.629 --> 02:06:46.639 align:start position:0%
that's not is it
 
02:06:49.189 --> 02:06:49.199 align:start position:0%
we have our state forester with us today
 
02:06:51.830 --> 02:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
mr arlinghaus uh patrick hackley is here
 
02:06:53.910 --> 02:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
and he can speak to that hi i'm patrick
 
02:06:55.750 --> 02:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
hackley i'm the director of division
 
02:07:01.030 --> 02:07:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:02.629 --> 02:07:02.639 align:start position:0%
we've been nip and tuck over the years
 
02:07:02.639 --> 02:07:03.350 align:start position:0%
we've been nip and tuck over the years
but

02:07:03.350 --> 02:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:07:05.109 --> 02:07:05.119 align:start position:0%
you know the last few years we've had an
 
02:07:05.119 --> 02:07:06.310 align:start position:0%
you know the last few years we've had an
excellent

02:07:06.310 --> 02:07:06.320 align:start position:0%
excellent
 
02:07:08.069 --> 02:07:08.079 align:start position:0%
return on what investment we have there
 
02:07:10.229 --> 02:07:10.239 align:start position:0%
we haven't made any major investments in
 
02:07:11.669 --> 02:07:11.679 align:start position:0%
quite some time
 
02:07:11.679 --> 02:07:12.470 align:start position:0%
quite some time
the

02:07:12.470 --> 02:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:07:13.750 --> 02:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
nursery was
 
02:07:16.229 --> 02:07:16.239 align:start position:0%
came into existence in 1910
 
02:07:17.669 --> 02:07:17.679 align:start position:0%
and i can show you some of the equipment
 
02:07:19.990 --> 02:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
that dates almost close to that in the
 
02:07:21.589 --> 02:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
barn itself
 
02:07:21.599 --> 02:07:22.709 align:start position:0%
barn itself
but

02:07:22.709 --> 02:07:22.719 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:07:22.719 --> 02:07:23.589 align:start position:0%
but
yeah

02:07:23.589 --> 02:07:23.599 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:07:25.189 --> 02:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
it's self-supporting and
 
02:07:27.669 --> 02:07:27.679 align:start position:0%
been doing very well
 
02:07:29.750 --> 02:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
i'd love to see that equipment for a
 
02:07:36.229 --> 02:07:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:42.790 --> 02:07:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:45.510 --> 02:07:45.520 align:start position:0%

good morning good morning you'll see on
 
02:10:06.470 --> 02:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
page one we have a summary of our
 
02:10:08.550 --> 02:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
request we have six requests that are a
 
02:10:10.709 --> 02:10:10.719 align:start position:0%
hundred percent liquor funded for a
 
02:10:13.669 --> 02:10:13.679 align:start position:0%
total of twelve million dollars
 
02:10:16.470 --> 02:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
if you go to page two the first request
 
02:10:18.390 --> 02:10:18.400 align:start position:0%
is for our hampton north and south new
 
02:10:20.790 --> 02:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
stores this is additional funding to
 
02:10:20.800 --> 02:10:21.830 align:start position:0%
stores this is additional funding to
construct

02:10:21.830 --> 02:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
construct
 
02:10:23.669 --> 02:10:23.679 align:start position:0%
two new twenty thousand square foot
 
02:10:26.950 --> 02:10:26.960 align:start position:0%
retail outlets on i-95 in hampton we put
 
02:10:28.870 --> 02:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
an original request for 14 million
 
02:10:32.870 --> 02:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
dollars in the fy 1819 budget and based
 
02:10:36.229 --> 02:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
on the current rates uh provided by dpw
 
02:10:38.470 --> 02:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
we've requested to increase the funding
 
02:10:41.830 --> 02:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
by almost 7.5 million
 
02:10:41.840 --> 02:10:43.189 align:start position:0%
by almost 7.5 million
currently

02:10:43.189 --> 02:10:43.199 align:start position:0%
currently
 
02:10:45.669 --> 02:10:45.679 align:start position:0%
we're working on existing title and use
 
02:10:48.149 --> 02:10:48.159 align:start position:0%
restrictions in advance of putting out
 
02:10:51.189 --> 02:10:51.199 align:start position:0%
an rfp to sell the properties and on
 
02:10:53.990 --> 02:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
june 17th we were advised that
 
02:10:55.990 --> 02:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
using the use restrictions could
 
02:10:57.990 --> 02:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
potentially be completed within the next
 
02:11:00.550 --> 02:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
90 days so hopefully we will be able to
 
02:11:04.229 --> 02:11:04.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:06.870 --> 02:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
on the next page is our headquarters
 
02:11:09.030 --> 02:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
life safety improvements
 
02:11:11.270 --> 02:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
our concord headquarters facility is 58
 
02:11:13.910 --> 02:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
years old and it needs a few life safety
 
02:11:13.920 --> 02:11:15.430 align:start position:0%
years old and it needs a few life safety
improvements

02:11:15.430 --> 02:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
improvements
 
02:11:17.589 --> 02:11:17.599 align:start position:0%
there's a roof replacement for a section
 
02:11:21.589 --> 02:11:21.599 align:start position:0%
of the roof that was done in 2017 but it
 
02:11:23.990 --> 02:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
wasn't done appropriately and we need to
 
02:11:25.990 --> 02:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
replace that section
 
02:11:29.430 --> 02:11:29.440 align:start position:0%
replacement of warehouse bay fire doors
 
02:11:31.189 --> 02:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
that were identified during a fire
 
02:11:33.430 --> 02:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
marshal inspection
 
02:11:35.109 --> 02:11:35.119 align:start position:0%
building security and door access
 
02:11:37.669 --> 02:11:37.679 align:start position:0%
controls that are past their useful life
 
02:11:39.589 --> 02:11:39.599 align:start position:0%
and are no longer supported so that's
 
02:11:41.589 --> 02:11:41.599 align:start position:0%
our key access systems to get into the
 
02:11:41.599 --> 02:11:43.189 align:start position:0%
our key access systems to get into the
building

02:11:43.189 --> 02:11:43.199 align:start position:0%
building
 
02:11:44.550 --> 02:11:44.560 align:start position:0%
and then additional funds for our
 
02:11:46.709 --> 02:11:46.719 align:start position:0%
parking lot project which was originally
 
02:11:48.709 --> 02:11:48.719 align:start position:0%
funded to expand and repave the parking
 
02:11:51.669 --> 02:11:51.679 align:start position:0%
lot but it's turned into a bigger issue
 
02:11:54.069 --> 02:11:54.079 align:start position:0%
with sewer lines catch basins and an
 
02:11:55.750 --> 02:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
infrastructure repair underneath the
 
02:11:57.750 --> 02:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
parking lot and then having to repave
 
02:12:03.270 --> 02:12:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:05.270 --> 02:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
item number three is our keen outlet
 
02:12:07.830 --> 02:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
roof replacement the keen store was
 
02:12:10.310 --> 02:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
built in 2005 and the roof is now
 
02:12:12.709 --> 02:12:12.719 align:start position:0%
leaking and needs to be replaced the
 
02:12:15.109 --> 02:12:15.119 align:start position:0%
original roof was not properly installed
 
02:12:17.550 --> 02:12:17.560 align:start position:0%
by the original installer and that's a
 
02:12:23.109 --> 02:12:23.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:25.510 --> 02:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
on the next page number four
 
02:12:27.430 --> 02:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
it's emergency funds
 
02:12:29.270 --> 02:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
the liquor commission maintains 10
 
02:12:30.950 --> 02:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
state-owned properties that range in the
 
02:12:34.470 --> 02:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
age from 1964 to 2018.
 
02:12:36.629 --> 02:12:36.639 align:start position:0%
so this request is to fund unexpected
 
02:12:38.069 --> 02:12:38.079 align:start position:0%
emergencies for the state-owned
 
02:12:38.079 --> 02:12:39.750 align:start position:0%
emergencies for the state-owned
properties

02:12:39.750 --> 02:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
properties
 
02:12:41.430 --> 02:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
over the last several years we've had a
 
02:12:45.109 --> 02:12:45.119 align:start position:0%
few issues such as sewer repairs hvac
 
02:12:47.430 --> 02:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
systems and roof leaks and as an
 
02:12:49.109 --> 02:12:49.119 align:start position:0%
enterprise fund this would allow the
 
02:12:55.510 --> 02:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:57.830 --> 02:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
item number five our computer software
 
02:13:00.709 --> 02:13:00.719 align:start position:0%
posd 365. we're in the process of
 
02:13:03.430 --> 02:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
replacing all point-of-sale hardware and
 
02:13:05.669 --> 02:13:05.679 align:start position:0%
software and back-office computer
 
02:13:05.679 --> 02:13:06.629 align:start position:0%
software and back-office computer
systems

02:13:06.629 --> 02:13:06.639 align:start position:0%
systems
 
02:13:08.950 --> 02:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
and this request is supplemental funds
 
02:13:11.030 --> 02:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
for enhancements or changes to the
 
02:13:13.350 --> 02:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
system and possibly additional equipment
 
02:13:14.470 --> 02:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
that might
 
02:13:15.589 --> 02:13:15.599 align:start position:0%
be needed
 
02:13:18.149 --> 02:13:18.159 align:start position:0%
after we go live
 
02:13:20.790 --> 02:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
this could give us the opportunity to
 
02:13:22.629 --> 02:13:22.639 align:start position:0%
implement enhancements that it can and
 
02:13:24.629 --> 02:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
could improve efficiencies and increase
 
02:13:24.639 --> 02:13:27.589 align:start position:0%
could improve efficiencies and increase
revenues

02:13:27.589 --> 02:13:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:28.830 --> 02:13:28.840 align:start position:0%
and then our last
 
02:13:31.430 --> 02:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
request is to renovate a section of our
 
02:13:31.440 --> 02:13:32.709 align:start position:0%
request is to renovate a section of our
warehouse

02:13:32.709 --> 02:13:32.719 align:start position:0%
warehouse
 
02:13:35.109 --> 02:13:35.119 align:start position:0%
we're looking to renovate 2200 square
 
02:13:37.030 --> 02:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
feet of the current warehouse space to
 
02:13:39.589 --> 02:13:39.599 align:start position:0%
put in multiple office spaces to allow
 
02:13:42.069 --> 02:13:42.079 align:start position:0%
for workspaces to be safely distanced
 
02:13:45.109 --> 02:13:45.119 align:start position:0%
and another conference room
 
02:13:46.870 --> 02:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
and that completes all of our requests
 
02:13:51.830 --> 02:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:51.840 --> 02:13:53.109 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:13:53.109 --> 02:13:53.119 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:13:57.350 --> 02:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
um item three on the roof replacement
 
02:14:00.149 --> 02:14:00.159 align:start position:0%
what kind of guarantee did we get
 
02:14:03.750 --> 02:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
when we built that building
 
02:14:06.069 --> 02:14:06.079 align:start position:0%
it's less than 20 years and it wasn't
 
02:14:08.310 --> 02:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
installed properly
 
02:14:10.149 --> 02:14:10.159 align:start position:0%
do we have the option to go back to
 
02:14:12.709 --> 02:14:12.719 align:start position:0%
whomever built it to do the repairs
 
02:14:12.719 --> 02:14:14.750 align:start position:0%
whomever built it to do the repairs
gratis

02:14:14.750 --> 02:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
gratis
 
02:14:16.950 --> 02:14:16.960 align:start position:0%
unfortunately um
 
02:14:19.189 --> 02:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
the keen request
 
02:14:21.030 --> 02:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
we're on number four
 
02:14:24.550 --> 02:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
uh no that that replacement was done
 
02:14:26.709 --> 02:14:26.719 align:start position:0%
that building was built a long time ago
 
02:14:26.719 --> 02:14:28.229 align:start position:0%
that building was built a long time ago
and

02:14:28.229 --> 02:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:14:30.229 --> 02:14:30.239 align:start position:0%
there's no there's nothing i'm talking
 
02:14:33.750 --> 02:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
keen number three you said 2005. yeah
 
02:14:35.589 --> 02:14:35.599 align:start position:0%
it's less than 20 years there's no
 
02:14:37.990 --> 02:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
recourse from what we can find uh andy
 
02:14:40.629 --> 02:14:40.639 align:start position:0%
davis has done some research our real
 
02:14:42.629 --> 02:14:42.639 align:start position:0%
estate person has done some research on
 
02:14:42.639 --> 02:14:43.589 align:start position:0%
estate person has done some research on
it

02:14:43.589 --> 02:14:43.599 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:14:45.189 --> 02:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
i'm not even sure that the builder is
 
02:14:46.790 --> 02:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
still in business who built it at that
 
02:14:46.800 --> 02:14:53.270 align:start position:0%
still in business who built it at that
time

02:14:53.270 --> 02:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:56.629 --> 02:14:56.639 align:start position:0%
okay uh just a a quick question you have
 
02:14:59.430 --> 02:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh with the new hampton north and south
 
02:15:01.350 --> 02:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
stores uh when are they going to come
 
02:15:03.270 --> 02:15:03.280 align:start position:0%
online what are they going to open
 
02:15:05.189 --> 02:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
uh well hampton north and south will be
 
02:15:07.910 --> 02:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
under an rfp that we're waiting to put
 
02:15:07.920 --> 02:15:08.629 align:start position:0%
under an rfp that we're waiting to put
out

02:15:08.629 --> 02:15:08.639 align:start position:0%
out
 
02:15:10.390 --> 02:15:10.400 align:start position:0%
there's been some discussion about some
 
02:15:13.750 --> 02:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
usable land northbound and southbound so
 
02:15:15.990 --> 02:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
we've worked with des
 
02:15:18.149 --> 02:15:18.159 align:start position:0%
we worked within
 
02:15:21.109 --> 02:15:21.119 align:start position:0%
we've worked with the town of hampton
 
02:15:23.830 --> 02:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
we did just have a meeting last week as
 
02:15:25.589 --> 02:15:25.599 align:start position:0%
tina had spoken to
 
02:15:28.149 --> 02:15:28.159 align:start position:0%
as soon as the rfp goes out
 
02:15:30.629 --> 02:15:30.639 align:start position:0%
those properties will be sold we had
 
02:15:33.350 --> 02:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
legislation put in i believe three years
 
02:15:35.750 --> 02:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
ago that allows us to sell those
 
02:15:39.189 --> 02:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
properties and use the funds to pay off
 
02:15:42.310 --> 02:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
liquor commission bonds so the revenues
 
02:15:44.950 --> 02:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
from that were thought to be as high as
 
02:15:47.830 --> 02:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
28 million but depending on the usable
 
02:15:50.709 --> 02:15:50.719 align:start position:0%
property obviously that will affect the
 
02:15:53.910 --> 02:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
cost i'm at the affect the sale price so
 
02:15:56.790 --> 02:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
we're waiting to see how much usable
 
02:15:59.669 --> 02:15:59.679 align:start position:0%
land we actually have to sell
 
02:16:02.629 --> 02:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
we put out an rfq we had eight vendors
 
02:16:05.350 --> 02:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
that are interested and obviously they
 
02:16:07.030 --> 02:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
have they have different
 
02:16:09.189 --> 02:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
forms of
 
02:16:11.030 --> 02:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
some of them wanted to put in hotels
 
02:16:12.069 --> 02:16:12.079 align:start position:0%
there was
 
02:16:14.310 --> 02:16:14.320 align:start position:0%
some that wanted to put in casinos
 
02:16:16.470 --> 02:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
obviously we want to we want to have a
 
02:16:18.629 --> 02:16:18.639 align:start position:0%
liquor store there and something that
 
02:16:21.430 --> 02:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
resembles what we've done in hooksett
 
02:16:21.440 --> 02:16:22.310 align:start position:0%
resembles what we've done in hooksett
so

02:16:22.310 --> 02:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:16:24.709 --> 02:16:24.719 align:start position:0%
as far as the sale price is concerned
 
02:16:27.109 --> 02:16:27.119 align:start position:0%
and the timing is concerned it's all it
 
02:16:28.950 --> 02:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
all hinges on that
 
02:16:31.589 --> 02:16:31.599 align:start position:0%
putting out that actual rfp
 
02:16:34.709 --> 02:16:34.719 align:start position:0%
okay we're talking sometime
 
02:16:37.190 --> 02:16:37.200 align:start position:0%
i would think that once the rfp is out
 
02:16:39.589 --> 02:16:39.599 align:start position:0%
we're probably going to see something
 
02:16:43.509 --> 02:16:43.519 align:start position:0%
starts at least toward the end of 24. i
 
02:16:45.110 --> 02:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
can't imagine it would be much further
 
02:16:47.030 --> 02:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
than that okay because
 
02:16:48.629 --> 02:16:48.639 align:start position:0%
we've been working on the project for
 
02:16:50.070 --> 02:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
six years
 
02:16:51.349 --> 02:16:51.359 align:start position:0%
one of my concerns that this is the
 
02:16:54.389 --> 02:16:54.399 align:start position:0%
current concern obviously is is is the
 
02:16:56.709 --> 02:16:56.719 align:start position:0%
manpower and the resources to actually
 
02:16:58.629 --> 02:16:58.639 align:start position:0%
man these stores and i know
 
02:17:00.469 --> 02:17:00.479 align:start position:0%
uh right i could imagine that you must
 
02:17:00.479 --> 02:17:01.349 align:start position:0%
uh right i could imagine that you must
be

02:17:01.349 --> 02:17:01.359 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:17:03.589 --> 02:17:03.599 align:start position:0%
experiencing the same thing that many
 
02:17:06.309 --> 02:17:06.319 align:start position:0%
retailers and including uh the state and
 
02:17:07.990 --> 02:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
private industries are in trying to
 
02:17:10.469 --> 02:17:10.479 align:start position:0%
attract especially part-time workers
 
02:17:12.709 --> 02:17:12.719 align:start position:0%
to fill roles absolutely but if this is
 
02:17:14.469 --> 02:17:14.479 align:start position:0%
far enough out where
 
02:17:16.469 --> 02:17:16.479 align:start position:0%
i would assume that the current
 
02:17:19.270 --> 02:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
shortage of of labor will hopefully have
 
02:17:19.280 --> 02:17:20.150 align:start position:0%
shortage of of labor will hopefully have
been

02:17:20.150 --> 02:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
been
 
02:17:22.309 --> 02:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
eradicated by that point we hope that
 
02:17:24.150 --> 02:17:24.160 align:start position:0%
changes by the time these new stores
 
02:17:26.070 --> 02:17:26.080 align:start position:0%
come online currently
 
02:17:29.669 --> 02:17:29.679 align:start position:0%
we're 150 part-timers down
 
02:17:32.110 --> 02:17:32.120 align:start position:0%
uh from a field of about
 
02:17:32.120 --> 02:17:33.669 align:start position:0%
uh from a field of about
618

02:17:33.669 --> 02:17:33.679 align:start position:0%
618
 
02:17:37.589 --> 02:17:37.599 align:start position:0%
and we're currently 35 full-timers down
 
02:17:40.709 --> 02:17:40.719 align:start position:0%
from a field of 216.
 
02:17:42.870 --> 02:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
so we have significant
 
02:17:45.990 --> 02:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
vacancy like as you as you stated like
 
02:17:48.549 --> 02:17:48.559 align:start position:0%
any other state agency or any other
 
02:17:50.950 --> 02:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
private business at this point right
 
02:17:50.960 --> 02:17:53.830 align:start position:0%
private business at this point right
okay

02:17:53.830 --> 02:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:55.669 --> 02:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning this is on the
 
02:17:57.910 --> 02:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
same thing the hampton stores in the
 
02:17:59.509 --> 02:17:59.519 align:start position:0%
handout it says that the original
 
02:18:01.750 --> 02:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
request was 14 million
 
02:18:04.790 --> 02:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
in the 1819 budget was that 14 million
 
02:18:06.870 --> 02:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
granted in that capital budget is this
 
02:18:09.990 --> 02:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
seven in addition to the 14 it is that's
 
02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:10.790 align:start position:0%
seven in addition to the 14 it is that's
correct

02:18:10.790 --> 02:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:18:12.629 --> 02:18:12.639 align:start position:0%
and we we go off of the numbers that
 
02:18:16.070 --> 02:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
were given from public works to base our
 
02:18:23.990 --> 02:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:25.509 --> 02:18:25.519 align:start position:0%
so you know the questions
 
02:18:27.110 --> 02:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you very much
 
02:18:32.230 --> 02:18:32.240 align:start position:0%

02:26:44.710 --> 02:26:44.720 align:start position:0%
little more detail on our projects
 
02:26:45.990 --> 02:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner good morning
 
02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:47.670 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner good morning
everyone

02:26:47.670 --> 02:26:47.680 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
02:26:49.750 --> 02:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
page two is our first request this is
 
02:26:52.550 --> 02:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
for the dmv the driver licensing system
 
02:26:54.469 --> 02:26:54.479 align:start position:0%
known as vision
 
02:26:57.110 --> 02:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
this system is critical to uh
 
02:26:59.349 --> 02:26:59.359 align:start position:0%
transaction processing at the dmv it
 
02:27:01.190 --> 02:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
also serves as a financial management
 
02:27:03.670 --> 02:27:03.680 align:start position:0%
system and it ensures compliance with
 
02:27:03.680 --> 02:27:04.790 align:start position:0%
system and it ensures compliance with
all

02:27:04.790 --> 02:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
all
 
02:27:07.349 --> 02:27:07.359 align:start position:0%
state and federal real id licensing laws
 
02:27:09.429 --> 02:27:09.439 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations
 
02:27:11.270 --> 02:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
this system processes transactions
 
02:27:13.590 --> 02:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
including driver license records bureau
 
02:27:16.230 --> 02:27:16.240 align:start position:0%
of hearings activities payment uh and
 
02:27:18.230 --> 02:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
processing of violations and impacts on
 
02:27:20.950 --> 02:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
driver records and also plate and decal
 
02:27:20.960 --> 02:27:22.469 align:start position:0%
driver records and also plate and decal
inventory

02:27:22.469 --> 02:27:22.479 align:start position:0%
inventory
 
02:27:24.230 --> 02:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
over the course of a fiscal year
 
02:27:26.070 --> 02:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
approximately 100 million dollars is
 
02:27:28.469 --> 02:27:28.479 align:start position:0%
processed through the vision system
 
02:27:30.950 --> 02:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
the server environment that hosts vision
 
02:27:33.190 --> 02:27:33.200 align:start position:0%
is approaching end of life and must be
 
02:27:35.429 --> 02:27:35.439 align:start position:0%
replaced and the department has worked
 
02:27:37.910 --> 02:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
with doit and looked at alternatives and
 
02:27:39.990 --> 02:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
determined that the most efficient and
 
02:27:42.550 --> 02:27:42.560 align:start position:0%
cost-effective option is to move the
 
02:27:44.950 --> 02:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
environment into the cloud and so that's
 
02:27:47.110 --> 02:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
what this 2.5 million dollar request
 
02:27:49.270 --> 02:27:49.280 align:start position:0%
would do it would move migrate the
 
02:27:51.750 --> 02:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
existing physical infrastructure to the
 
02:27:54.309 --> 02:27:54.319 align:start position:0%
cloud it would also update the existing
 
02:27:56.630 --> 02:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
back frame framework for microsoft
 
02:28:00.710 --> 02:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
dynamics crm to microsoft dynamics 365.
 
02:28:02.469 --> 02:28:02.479 align:start position:0%
so what this does is it leverages proven
 
02:28:02.479 --> 02:28:03.990 align:start position:0%
so what this does is it leverages proven
technology

02:28:03.990 --> 02:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
technology
 
02:28:05.990 --> 02:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
which makes our future upgrades easier
 
02:28:08.550 --> 02:28:08.560 align:start position:0%
and less costly and eliminates the need
 
02:28:10.309 --> 02:28:10.319 align:start position:0%
for increased support and overhead to
 
02:28:12.710 --> 02:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
maintain this critical business
 
02:28:12.720 --> 02:28:17.110 align:start position:0%
maintain this critical business
capability

02:28:17.110 --> 02:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:18.710 --> 02:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
the second project that we have is on
 
02:28:21.030 --> 02:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
page three and page four and this is to
 
02:28:23.830 --> 02:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
update the state message platform this
 
02:28:26.230 --> 02:28:26.240 align:start position:0%
falls under the division of state police
 
02:28:28.790 --> 02:28:28.800 align:start position:0%
the state message platform passes
 
02:28:30.790 --> 02:28:30.800 align:start position:0%
criminal justice information between all
 
02:28:32.630 --> 02:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
areas of the criminal justice system
 
02:28:34.309 --> 02:28:34.319 align:start position:0%
both at the federal level and at the
 
02:28:35.910 --> 02:28:35.920 align:start position:0%
state and local level
 
02:28:38.550 --> 02:28:38.560 align:start position:0%
it's really utilized and impacted by all
 
02:28:40.950 --> 02:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
folks federal state local and county law
 
02:28:43.910 --> 02:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement if you look on page four
 
02:28:45.830 --> 02:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
it's a good graphical representation of
 
02:28:48.309 --> 02:28:48.319 align:start position:0%
how the switch works and the impact
 
02:28:50.550 --> 02:28:50.560 align:start position:0%
the platform itself is in the center and
 
02:28:52.469 --> 02:28:52.479 align:start position:0%
you can see there's inbound and outbound
 
02:28:54.070 --> 02:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
queries from the fbi through the
 
02:28:55.510 --> 02:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
national instant criminal background
 
02:28:57.670 --> 02:28:57.680 align:start position:0%
check system as well as the national sex
 
02:28:59.830 --> 02:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
offender registry and you can also see
 
02:29:01.429 --> 02:29:01.439 align:start position:0%
that there's statewide data that's being
 
02:29:03.270 --> 02:29:03.280 align:start position:0%
passed through the switch as well that's
 
02:29:04.870 --> 02:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
through the division of state police
 
02:29:06.710 --> 02:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
motor vehicles the department of
 
02:29:09.030 --> 02:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
corrections the court system and local
 
02:29:11.110 --> 02:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
and county law enforcement
 
02:29:12.870 --> 02:29:12.880 align:start position:0%
the switch itself is a combination
 
02:29:15.270 --> 02:29:15.280 align:start position:0%
primarily hardware but there's a strong
 
02:29:17.110 --> 02:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
software component and
 
02:29:18.630 --> 02:29:18.640 align:start position:0%
both of those need to be replaced to
 
02:29:19.990 --> 02:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
ensure that this data is flowing
 
02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:24.230 align:start position:0%
ensure that this data is flowing
appropriately

02:29:24.230 --> 02:29:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:27.270 --> 02:29:27.280 align:start position:0%
page five is our third request
 
02:29:30.070 --> 02:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
this is to update the document scanning
 
02:29:32.230 --> 02:29:32.240 align:start position:0%
equipment that the dmv currently
 
02:29:35.270 --> 02:29:35.280 align:start position:0%
utilizes to record physical copies of
 
02:29:37.110 --> 02:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
documents that are received from across
 
02:29:38.550 --> 02:29:38.560 align:start position:0%
the state
 
02:29:41.429 --> 02:29:41.439 align:start position:0%
if you see on page six
 
02:29:43.190 --> 02:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
we're currently utilizing microfilm
 
02:29:45.910 --> 02:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
technology to archive these documents
 
02:29:48.230 --> 02:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
these include registrations titles
 
02:29:50.309 --> 02:29:50.319 align:start position:0%
purchase and sale agreements all the
 
02:29:52.150 --> 02:29:52.160 align:start position:0%
documents to support transactions that
 
02:29:54.070 --> 02:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
are being processed at the locals at
 
02:29:55.910 --> 02:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities and then also at dmv
 
02:29:55.920 --> 02:29:57.429 align:start position:0%
municipalities and then also at dmv
substations

02:29:57.429 --> 02:29:57.439 align:start position:0%
substations
 
02:29:59.030 --> 02:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
the equipment is
 
02:30:01.349 --> 02:30:01.359 align:start position:0%
it's old technology the equipment itself
 
02:30:03.429 --> 02:30:03.439 align:start position:0%
is breaking down regularly it's
 
02:30:05.030 --> 02:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
challenging to find individuals who can
 
02:30:07.030 --> 02:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
even service the equipment we're also
 
02:30:09.670 --> 02:30:09.680 align:start position:0%
having trouble finding options for
 
02:30:11.990 --> 02:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
film processing so
 
02:30:13.750 --> 02:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
this one million dollar request would
 
02:30:15.670 --> 02:30:15.680 align:start position:0%
allow the department to convert to
 
02:30:17.670 --> 02:30:17.680 align:start position:0%
digital scanning
 
02:30:17.680 --> 02:30:18.469 align:start position:0%
digital scanning
the

02:30:18.469 --> 02:30:18.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:30:20.790 --> 02:30:20.800 align:start position:0%
there might be some document indexing
 
02:30:23.990 --> 02:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
abilities to include in that request the
 
02:30:25.590 --> 02:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
scanning equipment would certainly be at
 
02:30:26.950 --> 02:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
the department of safety but there may
 
02:30:28.790 --> 02:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
be an opportunity to expand this to the
 
02:30:30.710 --> 02:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
local level as well since a lot of the
 
02:30:32.469 --> 02:30:32.479 align:start position:0%
documents are generated and obtained
 
02:30:32.479 --> 02:30:35.270 align:start position:0%
documents are generated and obtained
there

02:30:35.270 --> 02:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:37.270 --> 02:30:37.280 align:start position:0%
and then on page seven is our fourth
 
02:30:37.280 --> 02:30:38.389 align:start position:0%
and then on page seven is our fourth
request

02:30:38.389 --> 02:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
request
 
02:30:40.950 --> 02:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
this is to improve the technology of the
 
02:30:43.910 --> 02:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
state police helicopter this is a 1.5
 
02:30:45.750 --> 02:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
million dollar request
 
02:30:47.590 --> 02:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
to update a lot of the technology
 
02:30:49.510 --> 02:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
including the flir camera and mapping
 
02:30:51.750 --> 02:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
software which was originally installed
 
02:30:54.469 --> 02:30:54.479 align:start position:0%
in 2016 and is approaching its end of
 
02:30:54.479 --> 02:30:55.990 align:start position:0%
in 2016 and is approaching its end of
life

02:30:55.990 --> 02:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
life
 
02:30:57.990 --> 02:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
the helicopter is utilized for search
 
02:30:59.990 --> 02:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
and rescue operations
 
02:31:03.590 --> 02:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
to special event responses swat calls
 
02:31:05.590 --> 02:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
and also major disaster scene and storm
 
02:31:07.349 --> 02:31:07.359 align:start position:0%
damage assessments
 
02:31:09.910 --> 02:31:09.920 align:start position:0%
this improvement would fund an update to
 
02:31:12.150 --> 02:31:12.160 align:start position:0%
the fleer camera and then the augmented
 
02:31:15.270 --> 02:31:15.280 align:start position:0%
reality mission computer uh you can see
 
02:31:17.590 --> 02:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
pictures of both of those on page eight
 
02:31:19.750 --> 02:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
the mission computer is in the uh
 
02:31:21.590 --> 02:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
cockpit well it shows a picture of the
 
02:31:23.110 --> 02:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
cockpit on the bottom and then the
 
02:31:25.670 --> 02:31:25.680 align:start position:0%
mission computer is in the cabin
 
02:31:28.469 --> 02:31:28.479 align:start position:0%
the mission computer is utilized by the
 
02:31:30.389 --> 02:31:30.399 align:start position:0%
flight terminal operator to help guide
 
02:31:31.830 --> 02:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
the pilot and
 
02:31:33.670 --> 02:31:33.680 align:start position:0%
when providing the emergency response
 
02:31:35.990 --> 02:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
activities as as needed
 
02:31:39.030 --> 02:31:39.040 align:start position:0%
we'd also use this funding to integrate
 
02:31:40.710 --> 02:31:40.720 align:start position:0%
that system with the state's current
 
02:31:43.110 --> 02:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
video management system to enable
 
02:31:44.950 --> 02:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
real-time monitoring of criminal
 
02:31:46.950 --> 02:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
situations as they're developing and
 
02:31:48.550 --> 02:31:48.560 align:start position:0%
then there'd also be some miscellaneous
 
02:31:50.630 --> 02:31:50.640 align:start position:0%
flight equipment upgrades including
 
02:31:52.389 --> 02:31:52.399 align:start position:0%
white phosphorus night vision goggles
 
02:31:53.990 --> 02:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
and the related helmets
 
02:31:57.750 --> 02:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:59.910 --> 02:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
and so page nine shows a summary of our
 
02:32:01.670 --> 02:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
four projects as the commissioner
 
02:32:04.230 --> 02:32:04.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned they're all technology focused
 
02:32:06.469 --> 02:32:06.479 align:start position:0%
um they're based on ensuring that we
 
02:32:07.990 --> 02:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
continue to deliver
 
02:32:10.309 --> 02:32:10.319 align:start position:0%
public safety services across the state
 
02:32:12.469 --> 02:32:12.479 align:start position:0%
in an efficient and effective manner
 
02:32:13.670 --> 02:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
and they're really critical to
 
02:32:15.110 --> 02:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
maintaining the existing levels of
 
02:32:20.630 --> 02:32:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:22.389 --> 02:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
okay i'd like to open up for questions
 
02:32:25.429 --> 02:32:25.439 align:start position:0%
and my first question is
 
02:32:27.349 --> 02:32:27.359 align:start position:0%
we as far as the helicopter goes where
 
02:32:29.110 --> 02:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
02:32:31.990 --> 02:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
technological improvements to it but
 
02:32:33.270 --> 02:32:33.280 align:start position:0%
what's the status of the actual
 
02:32:35.670 --> 02:32:35.680 align:start position:0%
helicopter it's a bell 407
 
02:32:37.750 --> 02:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
is the helicopter as far as when was
 
02:32:40.550 --> 02:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
that purchase and what's the useful life
 
02:32:44.230 --> 02:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
remaining on that piece of equipment
 
02:32:44.240 --> 02:32:45.030 align:start position:0%
remaining on that piece of equipment
so

02:32:45.030 --> 02:32:45.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:32:46.710 --> 02:32:46.720 align:start position:0%
i can't give you the exact years but i
 
02:32:48.790 --> 02:32:48.800 align:start position:0%
had that question i asked that question
 
02:32:50.710 --> 02:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
recently and it's based on
 
02:32:52.550 --> 02:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
hours on the engine
 
02:32:56.309 --> 02:32:56.319 align:start position:0%
and it's based on any
 
02:32:58.389 --> 02:32:58.399 align:start position:0%
rust issues or infrastructure issues
 
02:32:59.750 --> 02:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
that they're seeing when they do the
 
02:33:02.950 --> 02:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
inspection right now the the helicopter
 
02:33:04.870 --> 02:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
you know meets the standards you know
 
02:33:06.710 --> 02:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
we've had these discussions internally
 
02:33:08.469 --> 02:33:08.479 align:start position:0%
what's next what's the plan we're not
 
02:33:11.429 --> 02:33:11.439 align:start position:0%
there now i'm looking at all options on
 
02:33:11.439 --> 02:33:12.630 align:start position:0%
there now i'm looking at all options on
replacement

02:33:12.630 --> 02:33:12.640 align:start position:0%
replacement
 
02:33:14.630 --> 02:33:14.640 align:start position:0%
these investments
 
02:33:17.110 --> 02:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
could be utilized in the event that say
 
02:33:20.469 --> 02:33:20.479 align:start position:0%
we lease the next helicopter so
 
02:33:22.230 --> 02:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
these investments could be transferred
 
02:33:23.990 --> 02:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
if we went in another direction but
 
02:33:25.830 --> 02:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
right now i think we're good for several
 
02:33:25.840 --> 02:33:26.790 align:start position:0%
right now i think we're good for several
years

02:33:26.790 --> 02:33:26.800 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:33:29.190 --> 02:33:29.200 align:start position:0%
i will say that uh the gentleman that we
 
02:33:31.830 --> 02:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
have in the state police
 
02:33:31.840 --> 02:33:32.830 align:start position:0%
have in the state police
business

02:33:32.830 --> 02:33:32.840 align:start position:0%
business
 
02:33:36.710 --> 02:33:36.720 align:start position:0%
um business and projects unit
 
02:33:38.870 --> 02:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
is a helicopter pilot was a helicopter
 
02:33:41.830 --> 02:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
pilot extensive career and he's um
 
02:33:43.510 --> 02:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
paying close attention to this and we're
 
02:33:45.349 --> 02:33:45.359 align:start position:0%
we're really looking at uh looking at
 
02:33:51.429 --> 02:33:51.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:51.439 --> 02:33:52.309 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:33:52.309 --> 02:33:52.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:33:52.319 --> 02:33:53.270 align:start position:0%
um
commission

02:33:53.270 --> 02:33:53.280 align:start position:0%
commission
 
02:33:55.190 --> 02:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
oh sorry
 
02:33:55.200 --> 02:33:57.349 align:start position:0%
oh sorry
commission

02:33:57.349 --> 02:33:57.359 align:start position:0%
commission
 
02:33:58.309 --> 02:33:58.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:34:00.230 --> 02:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
you heard me mention earlier that in
 
02:34:02.389 --> 02:34:02.399 align:start position:0%
some cases
 
02:34:05.190 --> 02:34:05.200 align:start position:0%
systems get you know the the software
 
02:34:07.349 --> 02:34:07.359 align:start position:0%
company stops supporting the on-premise
 
02:34:07.359 --> 02:34:08.309 align:start position:0%
company stops supporting the on-premise
version

02:34:08.309 --> 02:34:08.319 align:start position:0%
version
 
02:34:10.469 --> 02:34:10.479 align:start position:0%
so as it relates to the first request
 
02:34:12.710 --> 02:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
that's also a factor so this this
 
02:34:14.870 --> 02:34:14.880 align:start position:0%
version that
 
02:34:17.110 --> 02:34:17.120 align:start position:0%
dmv is now running
 
02:34:19.750 --> 02:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
will no longer exist or be supported so
 
02:34:21.110 --> 02:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
that's another
 
02:34:23.030 --> 02:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
to me a very significant driver for that
 
02:34:25.349 --> 02:34:25.359 align:start position:0%
project it's not a nice to have it's an
 
02:34:28.630 --> 02:34:28.640 align:start position:0%
absolute must-have project for dmv
 
02:34:31.590 --> 02:34:31.600 align:start position:0%
and um i would also say the dmv has
 
02:34:33.349 --> 02:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
distinguished themselves nationally
 
02:34:34.950 --> 02:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
because most of these
 
02:34:37.830 --> 02:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
types of projects are kind of disastrous
 
02:34:41.030 --> 02:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
in terms of business operations and the
 
02:34:43.670 --> 02:34:43.680 align:start position:0%
citizen service impacts involved and dmv
 
02:34:45.190 --> 02:34:45.200 align:start position:0%
has done a great job of
 
02:34:47.349 --> 02:34:47.359 align:start position:0%
actually keeping that system running
 
02:34:49.190 --> 02:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
solidly and
 
02:34:51.349 --> 02:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
and providing you know with limited
 
02:34:53.030 --> 02:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
resources really good customer service
 
02:34:53.040 --> 02:34:57.190 align:start position:0%
resources really good customer service
so

02:34:57.190 --> 02:34:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:59.349 --> 02:34:59.359 align:start position:0%
one of the questions that i'm sure will
 
02:35:01.030 --> 02:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
be asked and you don't need to answer it
 
02:35:04.150 --> 02:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
today is how did you determine
 
02:35:09.270 --> 02:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
on that it was 19 highway or 24
 
02:35:12.630 --> 02:35:12.640 align:start position:0%
turnpike on a different one those issues
 
02:35:16.070 --> 02:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
become very important as we look at the
 
02:35:18.230 --> 02:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
road toll
 
02:35:21.190 --> 02:35:21.200 align:start position:0%
declining over the years
 
02:35:23.910 --> 02:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
you don't need to answer it today but if
 
02:35:23.920 --> 02:35:24.950 align:start position:0%
you don't need to answer it today but if
these

02:35:24.950 --> 02:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
these
 
02:35:26.950 --> 02:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
projects make the cut with the governor
 
02:35:29.750 --> 02:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
i'm sure that the legislature will ask
 
02:35:29.760 --> 02:35:30.790 align:start position:0%
i'm sure that the legislature will ask
them

02:35:30.790 --> 02:35:30.800 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:35:30.800 --> 02:35:31.910 align:start position:0%
them
because

02:35:31.910 --> 02:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:35:33.670 --> 02:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
every dollar that goes into something
 
02:35:36.230 --> 02:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
like that is is less that goes on to our
 
02:35:37.910 --> 02:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
roads and bridges
 
02:35:43.510 --> 02:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:47.429 --> 02:35:47.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:49.510 --> 02:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
along those same lines
 
02:35:51.429 --> 02:35:51.439 align:start position:0%
does the turnpike or highway funding
 
02:35:53.349 --> 02:35:53.359 align:start position:0%
impact what some of these are labeled as
 
02:35:56.389 --> 02:35:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:58.389 --> 02:35:58.399 align:start position:0%
uh no no the cost of collections is
 
02:35:59.670 --> 02:35:59.680 align:start position:0%
separate from
 
02:36:02.070 --> 02:36:02.080 align:start position:0%
those funding mixes
 
02:36:04.230 --> 02:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
however costs of collections comes
 
02:36:09.830 --> 02:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
directly off the top of the road toll
 
02:36:11.670 --> 02:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
correct it's all
 
02:36:13.830 --> 02:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
to your point uh representative it's all
 
02:36:16.469 --> 02:36:16.479 align:start position:0%
it's all related um and and our approach
 
02:36:18.870 --> 02:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
has always been um
 
02:36:20.870 --> 02:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
we're less concerned about the the
 
02:36:22.870 --> 02:36:22.880 align:start position:0%
source of funding and more concerned
 
02:36:24.870 --> 02:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
about the funding itself
 
02:36:25.910 --> 02:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
so those
 
02:36:27.590 --> 02:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
percentages are
 
02:36:29.429 --> 02:36:29.439 align:start position:0%
we're happy to revisit those if they're
 
02:36:34.309 --> 02:36:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:34.319 --> 02:36:35.270 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:36:35.270 --> 02:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:36:37.030 --> 02:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
that's any other further questions thank
 
02:36:38.309 --> 02:36:38.319 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
02:36:40.550 --> 02:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:36:43.830 --> 02:36:43.840 align:start position:0%
uh the hearing uh will stand in recess
 
02:36:46.070 --> 02:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
now on for lunch break and we will
 
02:39:50.710 --> 02:39:50.720 align:start position:0%

you

02:40:17.990 --> 02:40:18.000 align:start position:0%

you

02:41:24.389 --> 02:41:24.399 align:start position:0%

you

02:45:09.670 --> 02:45:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:09.680 --> 03:08:33.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

03:08:33.830 --> 03:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:33.840 --> 03:11:07.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

03:11:07.830 --> 03:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:07.840 --> 03:11:49.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

03:11:49.830 --> 03:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:49.840 --> 03:23:01.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

03:23:01.830 --> 03:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:01.840 --> 04:00:10.150 align:start position:0%
 
you

04:00:10.150 --> 04:00:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:17.830 --> 04:00:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:20.389 --> 04:00:20.399 align:start position:0%
it is now 1pm and i'd like to reconvene
 
04:00:22.790 --> 04:00:22.800 align:start position:0%
the governor capital budget hearing and
 
04:00:24.229 --> 04:00:24.239 align:start position:0%
i would like to invite the department of
 
04:00:41.510 --> 04:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:43.189 --> 04:00:43.199 align:start position:0%
afternoon commissioner
 
04:00:45.429 --> 04:00:45.439 align:start position:0%
good afternoon sir and honorable members
 
04:00:47.349 --> 04:00:47.359 align:start position:0%
of the committee i hope you had a very
 
04:00:49.110 --> 04:00:49.120 align:start position:0%
satisfying lunch because that'll predict
 
04:00:51.510 --> 04:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
how this conversation goes
 
04:00:53.429 --> 04:00:53.439 align:start position:0%
looks pretty good out there
 
04:00:54.870 --> 04:00:54.880 align:start position:0%
helen hanks for the record commissioner
 
04:00:56.309 --> 04:00:56.319 align:start position:0%
of the department of corrections to my
 
04:00:58.630 --> 04:00:58.640 align:start position:0%
right is jonathan hanson our agency's
 
04:01:00.950 --> 04:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
director of administration
 
04:01:02.790 --> 04:01:02.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to talk
 
04:01:05.030 --> 04:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
about the corrections department asks on
 
04:01:07.349 --> 04:01:07.359 align:start position:0%
the capital budget side
 
04:01:09.030 --> 04:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
so before you have a modified
 
04:01:11.750 --> 04:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
presentation um trying to streamline our
 
04:01:13.670 --> 04:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
requests uh differently than what we
 
04:01:13.680 --> 04:01:14.710 align:start position:0%
requests uh differently than what we
remitted

04:01:14.710 --> 04:01:14.720 align:start position:0%
remitted
 
04:01:16.550 --> 04:01:16.560 align:start position:0%
what feels like a long time ago but i
 
04:01:17.750 --> 04:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
guess it wasn't
 
04:01:20.070 --> 04:01:20.080 align:start position:0%
and you'll see seven priorities
 
04:01:22.150 --> 04:01:22.160 align:start position:0%
and as the governor kicked off this
 
04:01:22.160 --> 04:01:23.030 align:start position:0%
and as the governor kicked off this
morning

04:01:23.030 --> 04:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
morning
 
04:01:25.269 --> 04:01:25.279 align:start position:0%
it has been really clear i'm rounding
 
04:01:27.670 --> 04:01:27.680 align:start position:0%
out my 19th year with the department in
 
04:01:29.750 --> 04:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
october october 3rd if you want to send
 
04:01:31.750 --> 04:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
me a gift but
 
04:01:33.110 --> 04:01:33.120 align:start position:0%
what's been really clear is the
 
04:01:34.870 --> 04:01:34.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the department and going
 
04:01:34.880 --> 04:01:35.750 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the department and going
through

04:01:35.750 --> 04:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
through
 
04:01:37.670 --> 04:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
our public works projects and the
 
04:01:38.950 --> 04:01:38.960 align:start position:0%
infrastructure at the new hampshire
 
04:01:41.670 --> 04:01:41.680 align:start position:0%
state prison for men is that facility is
 
04:01:44.150 --> 04:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
not going to last i have worked with
 
04:01:46.309 --> 04:01:46.319 align:start position:0%
john and seeing things i didn't think
 
04:01:49.269 --> 04:01:49.279 align:start position:0%
were plausible or possible as far as as
 
04:01:52.550 --> 04:01:52.560 align:start position:0%
electrical as far as cement erosion as
 
04:01:55.670 --> 04:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
far as where water will always go
 
04:01:55.680 --> 04:01:56.870 align:start position:0%
far as where water will always go
and

04:01:56.870 --> 04:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:01:56.880 --> 04:01:57.670 align:start position:0%
and
that

04:01:57.670 --> 04:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:02:00.309 --> 04:02:00.319 align:start position:0%
we as a state really needs to understand
 
04:02:03.189 --> 04:02:03.199 align:start position:0%
how to move forward and how to work on
 
04:02:05.750 --> 04:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh developing a facility that both is
 
04:02:08.309 --> 04:02:08.319 align:start position:0%
staffing efficient but as well as
 
04:02:11.110 --> 04:02:11.120 align:start position:0%
structurally sound and we're trying to
 
04:02:13.910 --> 04:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
in this ask in this budget
 
04:02:15.830 --> 04:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
ask for the things that we need
 
04:02:18.229 --> 04:02:18.239 align:start position:0%
before we get to a new facility
 
04:02:19.990 --> 04:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
and i hope that you'll find that with us
 
04:02:20.000 --> 04:02:22.309 align:start position:0%
and i hope that you'll find that with us
today

04:02:22.309 --> 04:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
today
 
04:02:24.469 --> 04:02:24.479 align:start position:0%
so you'll see a preliminary study of a
 
04:02:27.189 --> 04:02:27.199 align:start position:0%
new facility for men in concord and we
 
04:02:31.349 --> 04:02:31.359 align:start position:0%
want to include in there also financial
 
04:02:32.630 --> 04:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
opportunities that we should be
 
04:02:35.189 --> 04:02:35.199 align:start position:0%
considering as a state and we've come up
 
04:02:37.750 --> 04:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
with 2.5 million and i can have john
 
04:02:40.469 --> 04:02:40.479 align:start position:0%
talk to that as we move forward the
 
04:02:43.110 --> 04:02:43.120 align:start position:0%
second is our kitchen renovation project
 
04:02:44.309 --> 04:02:44.319 align:start position:0%
for members of the committee who have
 
04:02:46.870 --> 04:02:46.880 align:start position:0%
been here before and new members
 
04:02:48.550 --> 04:02:48.560 align:start position:0%
working with health and human services
 
04:02:50.309 --> 04:02:50.319 align:start position:0%
our kitchen at the new hampshire state
 
04:02:51.910 --> 04:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
prison for men
 
04:02:53.510 --> 04:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
and pictures are worth a thousand words
 
04:02:55.510 --> 04:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
so we'll go through those as well
 
04:02:57.670 --> 04:02:57.680 align:start position:0%
needs a renovation and
 
04:02:59.750 --> 04:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
and was funded for it but as most
 
04:03:01.990 --> 04:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
projects has have moved forward we need
 
04:03:04.710 --> 04:03:04.720 align:start position:0%
more money to get the job done
 
04:03:07.349 --> 04:03:07.359 align:start position:0%
what's new this year number three is our
 
04:03:09.429 --> 04:03:09.439 align:start position:0%
radio system upgrade
 
04:03:11.590 --> 04:03:11.600 align:start position:0%
we are still on an analog based system
 
04:03:14.469 --> 04:03:14.479 align:start position:0%
and the fcc some time ago as early as i
 
04:03:18.070 --> 04:03:18.080 align:start position:0%
think 2014 or 15 told agencies to switch
 
04:03:20.229 --> 04:03:20.239 align:start position:0%
to a digital system and this system is
 
04:03:23.269 --> 04:03:23.279 align:start position:0%
our main communication path for security
 
04:03:26.630 --> 04:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
it needs a major upgrade
 
04:03:29.429 --> 04:03:29.439 align:start position:0%
we have to continue to replace steam
 
04:03:31.670 --> 04:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
traps and lines and we need additional
 
04:03:33.349 --> 04:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
funding for the project that was
 
04:03:35.750 --> 04:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
previously authorized in number four the
 
04:03:39.189 --> 04:03:39.199 align:start position:0%
same is true in number five and then uh
 
04:03:42.070 --> 04:03:42.080 align:start position:0%
in six as well as seven our security
 
04:03:44.389 --> 04:03:44.399 align:start position:0%
defense detection being our primary and
 
04:03:47.750 --> 04:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
most outward facing security control and
 
04:03:49.830 --> 04:03:49.840 align:start position:0%
then the construction uh training center
 
04:03:51.429 --> 04:03:51.439 align:start position:0%
for building trades is targeted for
 
04:03:53.510 --> 04:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
women who are incarcerated and we need
 
04:03:55.189 --> 04:03:55.199 align:start position:0%
additional money to finish that project
 
04:03:57.030 --> 04:03:57.040 align:start position:0%
and be
 
04:03:58.550 --> 04:03:58.560 align:start position:0%
collaborative with our new hampshire
 
04:04:00.229 --> 04:04:00.239 align:start position:0%
legal assistance partners in moving
 
04:04:01.670 --> 04:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
equity forward for women who are
 
04:04:04.630 --> 04:04:04.640 align:start position:0%
incarcerated so if we go to page two we
 
04:04:07.189 --> 04:04:07.199 align:start position:0%
start to show you some pictures of our
 
04:04:08.710 --> 04:04:08.720 align:start position:0%
new hampshire state
 
04:04:10.710 --> 04:04:10.720 align:start position:0%
prison for men
 
04:04:10.720 --> 04:04:11.750 align:start position:0%
prison for men
that

04:04:11.750 --> 04:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:04:13.830 --> 04:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
facility if you haven't have the luxury
 
04:04:15.110 --> 04:04:15.120 align:start position:0%
of walking through it i'd be happy to
 
04:04:16.550 --> 04:04:16.560 align:start position:0%
take you through that anytime and let
 
04:04:18.469 --> 04:04:18.479 align:start position:0%
you back out
 
04:04:20.630 --> 04:04:20.640 align:start position:0%
is a campus style infrastructure
 
04:04:22.389 --> 04:04:22.399 align:start position:0%
it is not efficient from a staffing
 
04:04:25.269 --> 04:04:25.279 align:start position:0%
model it causes challenges in having to
 
04:04:26.870 --> 04:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
have numerous movements to control
 
04:04:26.880 --> 04:04:28.550 align:start position:0%
have numerous movements to control
classifications

04:04:28.550 --> 04:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
classifications
 
04:04:30.229 --> 04:04:30.239 align:start position:0%
and the staffing complement to go with
 
04:04:30.239 --> 04:04:31.110 align:start position:0%
and the staffing complement to go with
that

04:04:31.110 --> 04:04:31.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:04:32.710 --> 04:04:32.720 align:start position:0%
so even in the second picture on that
 
04:04:34.870 --> 04:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
slide you can see how inefficient having
 
04:04:38.469 --> 04:04:38.479 align:start position:0%
a wide open space is
 
04:04:40.469 --> 04:04:40.479 align:start position:0%
to travel to housing units and so on and
 
04:04:41.910 --> 04:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
so forth
 
04:04:43.990 --> 04:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
what's not gleaned here is just the age
 
04:04:45.830 --> 04:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
of the buildings and john if you could
 
04:04:47.590 --> 04:04:47.600 align:start position:0%
speak to the differing ages i think that
 
04:04:49.269 --> 04:04:49.279 align:start position:0%
will help people listening to the
 
04:04:49.279 --> 04:04:50.870 align:start position:0%
will help people listening to the
presentation

04:04:50.870 --> 04:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
04:04:50.880 --> 04:04:51.750 align:start position:0%
presentation
sure

04:04:51.750 --> 04:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
sure
 
04:04:53.590 --> 04:04:53.600 align:start position:0%
so the men's prison in concord was built
 
04:04:55.750 --> 04:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
in 1878. that's the new prison it was
 
04:04:57.510 --> 04:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
moved up from tremont street that one
 
04:04:59.670 --> 04:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
was the older prison
 
04:05:01.670 --> 04:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
1878 that building was built before
 
04:05:03.590 --> 04:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
there was electricity so you can imagine
 
04:05:05.269 --> 04:05:05.279 align:start position:0%
some of the challenges we had to rewire
 
04:05:08.229 --> 04:05:08.239 align:start position:0%
that um actually the 1878 portions of
 
04:05:10.229 --> 04:05:10.239 align:start position:0%
that facility are in pretty good shape
 
04:05:12.229 --> 04:05:12.239 align:start position:0%
the additions that were put on in 1980
 
04:05:14.469 --> 04:05:14.479 align:start position:0%
to 1983 were the major additions those
 
04:05:15.590 --> 04:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
were behind
 
04:05:17.429 --> 04:05:17.439 align:start position:0%
the existing men's facility and if
 
04:05:19.429 --> 04:05:19.439 align:start position:0%
you've been up there you know that's in
 
04:05:21.110 --> 04:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
between the women's and the men's that
 
04:05:22.950 --> 04:05:22.960 align:start position:0%
side hill that they cut into
 
04:05:22.960 --> 04:05:23.990 align:start position:0%
side hill that they cut into
um

04:05:23.990 --> 04:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:25.830 --> 04:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
those areas are having some serious
 
04:05:27.670 --> 04:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
challenges structurally and as ted knows
 
04:05:29.030 --> 04:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
and some of his staff have gone out
 
04:05:30.950 --> 04:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
there with me to see some things that
 
04:05:33.830 --> 04:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
are unique in that we've had um
 
04:05:35.990 --> 04:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
a we have a large ramp that is actually
 
04:05:37.910 --> 04:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
a roof a very unique design and that
 
04:05:39.349 --> 04:05:39.359 align:start position:0%
goes over the kitchen area we'll talk
 
04:05:41.030 --> 04:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
about that in a little bit but those
 
04:05:43.910 --> 04:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
challenges that we have within that
 
04:05:46.389 --> 04:05:46.399 align:start position:0%
newer section are pretty extensive and
 
04:05:47.910 --> 04:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
structurally we're having some serious
 
04:05:49.990 --> 04:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
issues we're also looking at some things
 
04:05:51.750 --> 04:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
like and we'll talk about this later too
 
04:05:52.630 --> 04:05:52.640 align:start position:0%
with the
 
04:05:54.790 --> 04:05:54.800 align:start position:0%
with the kitchen renovation coming into
 
04:05:56.469 --> 04:05:56.479 align:start position:0%
the yard area which you see in some of
 
04:06:00.070 --> 04:06:00.080 align:start position:0%
those photographs on the first slide
 
04:06:02.550 --> 04:06:02.560 align:start position:0%
that yard area actually has
 
04:06:04.150 --> 04:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
some coal
 
04:06:06.630 --> 04:06:06.640 align:start position:0%
pockets and things that back in the day
 
04:06:08.950 --> 04:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
when the big huge boilers were there
 
04:06:11.189 --> 04:06:11.199 align:start position:0%
they trucked in coal and dumped by train
 
04:06:12.870 --> 04:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
into the ground and then it was
 
04:06:14.469 --> 04:06:14.479 align:start position:0%
conveyored into these
 
04:06:16.550 --> 04:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
giant boilers
 
04:06:18.070 --> 04:06:18.080 align:start position:0%
when they tore down those industry
 
04:06:20.630 --> 04:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
buildings in between in 1980
 
04:06:22.550 --> 04:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
they still left some
 
04:06:25.030 --> 04:06:25.040 align:start position:0%
caverns and voids and those are areas
 
04:06:26.710 --> 04:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
that we want to expand out in the
 
04:06:27.910 --> 04:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
kitchen area so we're going to be
 
04:06:30.070 --> 04:06:30.080 align:start position:0%
talking about some potential pilings or
 
04:06:31.189 --> 04:06:31.199 align:start position:0%
at least some
 
04:06:33.830 --> 04:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
unique base structuring for that
 
04:06:35.110 --> 04:06:35.120 align:start position:0%
for the footings for that for that
 
04:06:35.120 --> 04:06:35.990 align:start position:0%
for the footings for that for that
building

04:06:35.990 --> 04:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
building
 
04:06:37.269 --> 04:06:37.279 align:start position:0%
so those are some of the challenges
 
04:06:39.349 --> 04:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
we're having on that area and as the
 
04:06:41.269 --> 04:06:41.279 align:start position:0%
commissioner indicated
 
04:06:43.110 --> 04:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
to do the this as the governor mentioned
 
04:06:45.030 --> 04:06:45.040 align:start position:0%
this morning as well to determine that
 
04:06:47.030 --> 04:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
feasibility and the preliminary
 
04:06:48.550 --> 04:06:48.560 align:start position:0%
engineering costs
 
04:06:49.990 --> 04:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
and the cost estimates to build
 
04:06:51.269 --> 04:06:51.279 align:start position:0%
something new are really what we're
 
04:06:53.110 --> 04:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
looking for with this first item now
 
04:06:55.910 --> 04:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
versus the full monty and asking for the
 
04:06:55.920 --> 04:06:57.110 align:start position:0%
versus the full monty and asking for the
entire

04:06:57.110 --> 04:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
entire
 
04:07:00.870 --> 04:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:02.469 --> 04:07:02.479 align:start position:0%
as we go along too as part of that
 
04:07:04.309 --> 04:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
engineering study and as as we've talked
 
04:07:06.550 --> 04:07:06.560 align:start position:0%
a few of us about that funding there are
 
04:07:08.389 --> 04:07:08.399 align:start position:0%
some unique funding opportunities that
 
04:07:08.399 --> 04:07:09.750 align:start position:0%
some unique funding opportunities that
i'm

04:07:09.750 --> 04:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
04:07:11.750 --> 04:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
i'm hoping that the legislature and you
 
04:07:13.590 --> 04:07:13.600 align:start position:0%
folks will look at
 
04:07:15.269 --> 04:07:15.279 align:start position:0%
obviously at least revenue bonds are
 
04:07:16.950 --> 04:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
being used around around the country for
 
04:07:18.950 --> 04:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
this type of facility versus a general
 
04:07:21.110 --> 04:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
obligation bond that is a different way
 
04:07:22.469 --> 04:07:22.479 align:start position:0%
to fund the facility
 
04:07:24.229 --> 04:07:24.239 align:start position:0%
there is a multitude of different ways
 
04:07:25.750 --> 04:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
and that is part of the study we really
 
04:07:27.030 --> 04:07:27.040 align:start position:0%
need to flesh out if that's a
 
04:07:29.030 --> 04:07:29.040 align:start position:0%
possibility to do this because
 
04:07:30.790 --> 04:07:30.800 align:start position:0%
as the governor mentioned this morning
 
04:07:30.800 --> 04:07:31.830 align:start position:0%
as the governor mentioned this morning
uh

04:07:31.830 --> 04:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:07:34.309 --> 04:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
350 million dollars
 
04:07:37.349 --> 04:07:37.359 align:start position:0%
right now would be the minimum to build
 
04:07:39.590 --> 04:07:39.600 align:start position:0%
the size of the facility we need the the
 
04:07:42.229 --> 04:07:42.239 align:start position:0%
federal prison in uh berlin
 
04:07:45.590 --> 04:07:45.600 align:start position:0%
was all in i think it was 430 430
 
04:07:48.550 --> 04:07:48.560 align:start position:0%
million in 2012. of course it's bigger
 
04:07:50.790 --> 04:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
but that is a modern facility and that's
 
04:07:52.950 --> 04:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
what the type of facility we believe we
 
04:07:54.389 --> 04:07:54.399 align:start position:0%
need to to build
 
04:07:56.469 --> 04:07:56.479 align:start position:0%
there's also some issues that we need to
 
04:07:58.070 --> 04:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
flesh out on this preliminary design as
 
04:08:01.110 --> 04:08:01.120 align:start position:0%
far as location and utilities we
 
04:08:03.990 --> 04:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
need maximum utilities at this facility
 
04:08:05.830 --> 04:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
we use over a million gallons of water a
 
04:08:08.389 --> 04:08:08.399 align:start position:0%
day thankfully from the city of concord
 
04:08:10.710 --> 04:08:10.720 align:start position:0%
we have some of the largest power feeds
 
04:08:12.229 --> 04:08:12.239 align:start position:0%
in the city of concord
 
04:08:14.070 --> 04:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
i believe we're either par or second to
 
04:08:16.070 --> 04:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
concord hospital
 
04:08:18.149 --> 04:08:18.159 align:start position:0%
and the size of facility as as you say
 
04:08:19.590 --> 04:08:19.600 align:start position:0%
in your in your
 
04:08:21.349 --> 04:08:21.359 align:start position:0%
um capital budget planning we really
 
04:08:23.590 --> 04:08:23.600 align:start position:0%
need to look at anticipated 50-year life
 
04:08:25.830 --> 04:08:25.840 align:start position:0%
of that facility minimum so we need to
 
04:08:28.070 --> 04:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
really determine down the road what that
 
04:08:30.710 --> 04:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
would be and as helen indicated there's
 
04:08:32.550 --> 04:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
a multitude of different designs you
 
04:08:34.550 --> 04:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
know the typical prison designs going
 
04:08:36.870 --> 04:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
back many many years you know your
 
04:08:38.950 --> 04:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
radial designs courtyard designs the
 
04:08:41.349 --> 04:08:41.359 align:start position:0%
telephone pole design and the campus
 
04:08:41.359 --> 04:08:42.950 align:start position:0%
telephone pole design and the campus
design

04:08:42.950 --> 04:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
design
 
04:08:44.630 --> 04:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
and everything we design here is it
 
04:08:47.269 --> 04:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
needs to be to reduce recidivism
 
04:08:48.710 --> 04:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
and as they say in some of the best
 
04:08:50.550 --> 04:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
prisons in the in the world right now
 
04:08:52.469 --> 04:08:52.479 align:start position:0%
and hauled in norway you know being in
 
04:08:54.630 --> 04:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
prison is the punishment the design
 
04:09:00.550 --> 04:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:03.830 --> 04:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
so as you can see on page three and then
 
04:09:05.910 --> 04:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
continued on page four we tried to take
 
04:09:09.030 --> 04:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
some pictures of
 
04:09:10.790 --> 04:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
both the what i call the apartment
 
04:09:12.469 --> 04:09:12.479 align:start position:0%
complex style
 
04:09:15.110 --> 04:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
general population housing units um i
 
04:09:16.389 --> 04:09:16.399 align:start position:0%
think it's important as you look at
 
04:09:17.910 --> 04:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
three these were designed for
 
04:09:21.590 --> 04:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
approximately 120 people 120 people and
 
04:09:24.149 --> 04:09:24.159 align:start position:0%
then um in 2009 when we shut down the
 
04:09:26.870 --> 04:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
lakes region facility due to funding and
 
04:09:30.309 --> 04:09:30.319 align:start position:0%
economics now we house 240 people
 
04:09:32.070 --> 04:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
so it's no surprise we had to replace
 
04:09:33.670 --> 04:09:33.680 align:start position:0%
those bathrooms and it's no surprise
 
04:09:35.990 --> 04:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
that these infrastructures of
 
04:09:37.990 --> 04:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
are running out of their architectural
 
04:09:41.110 --> 04:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:43.349 --> 04:09:43.359 align:start position:0%
on page four you'll see against that
 
04:09:46.309 --> 04:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
concrete erosion on the uh
 
04:09:48.309 --> 04:09:48.319 align:start position:0%
picture on page four to the right of
 
04:09:49.510 --> 04:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
your slide
 
04:09:52.229 --> 04:09:52.239 align:start position:0%
that actually um that concrete holds in
 
04:09:54.950 --> 04:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
a fenced barrier that questionably i'm
 
04:09:57.429 --> 04:09:57.439 align:start position:0%
not even sure how we would re-secure it
 
04:09:59.110 --> 04:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
if it falls down
 
04:10:01.830 --> 04:10:01.840 align:start position:0%
it's very some very strange things
 
04:10:04.870 --> 04:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:07.189 --> 04:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
as you go to slide five we try to show
 
04:10:08.550 --> 04:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
you some of the mechanicals and
 
04:10:10.710 --> 04:10:10.720 align:start position:0%
electrical uh situations within the
 
04:10:10.720 --> 04:10:12.389 align:start position:0%
electrical uh situations within the
institution

04:10:12.389 --> 04:10:12.399 align:start position:0%
institution
 
04:10:14.389 --> 04:10:14.399 align:start position:0%
and i will say through my time as
 
04:10:16.149 --> 04:10:16.159 align:start position:0%
commissioner admin services you've been
 
04:10:18.389 --> 04:10:18.399 align:start position:0%
an amazing partner when uh we've had
 
04:10:20.149 --> 04:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
ground lines spliced underground that i
 
04:10:21.910 --> 04:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
didn't even know were there transformers
 
04:10:23.990 --> 04:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
explode that you we had a hard time
 
04:10:25.590 --> 04:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
finding a new one
 
04:10:27.510 --> 04:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
so again we're trying to get hold of the
 
04:10:30.309 --> 04:10:30.319 align:start position:0%
situation in a more timely manner
 
04:10:32.469 --> 04:10:32.479 align:start position:0%
and then moving to page six we talk
 
04:10:34.790 --> 04:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
about the kitchen renovation continue to
 
04:10:37.269 --> 04:10:37.279 align:start position:0%
show you the state of the kitchen
 
04:10:39.349 --> 04:10:39.359 align:start position:0%
we do have these structures in the
 
04:10:41.429 --> 04:10:41.439 align:start position:0%
ceiling to direct and control water
 
04:10:43.910 --> 04:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
coming in through the ramped ceiling
 
04:10:46.229 --> 04:10:46.239 align:start position:0%
that was designed
 
04:10:49.030 --> 04:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
to go into drains in the floor and
 
04:10:50.790 --> 04:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
we continue to be monitored by our
 
04:10:52.309 --> 04:10:52.319 align:start position:0%
partners at health and human services
 
04:10:54.070 --> 04:10:54.080 align:start position:0%
and do our own monitoring to make sure
 
04:10:56.149 --> 04:10:56.159 align:start position:0%
that the food being delivered does not
 
04:10:58.469 --> 04:10:58.479 align:start position:0%
sicken anyone but it does need to be
 
04:11:00.149 --> 04:11:00.159 align:start position:0%
finished and we need more money to
 
04:11:02.309 --> 04:11:02.319 align:start position:0%
accomplish that
 
04:11:03.910 --> 04:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
page seven we continue to show you
 
04:11:06.469 --> 04:11:06.479 align:start position:0%
pictures of the existing kitchen
 
04:11:08.389 --> 04:11:08.399 align:start position:0%
and yes there are tarps behind those
 
04:11:11.269 --> 04:11:11.279 align:start position:0%
pots again to control water
 
04:11:15.189 --> 04:11:15.199 align:start position:0%
and water access while we're cooking
 
04:11:18.710 --> 04:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
on page 8 we show you the radio system
 
04:11:21.830 --> 04:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
upgrade the new project in this proposal
 
04:11:23.670 --> 04:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
that is a picture
 
04:11:25.510 --> 04:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
on the left side of the page
 
04:11:25.520 --> 04:11:27.429 align:start position:0%
on the left side of the page
of

04:11:27.429 --> 04:11:27.439 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:11:29.830 --> 04:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
peter in the attic it is not up to
 
04:11:31.990 --> 04:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
current standard and needs to be up to
 
04:11:35.349 --> 04:11:35.359 align:start position:0%
current standard and on the spec
 
04:11:37.030 --> 04:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
picture this literally the number of
 
04:11:39.590 --> 04:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
radios just at the men's prison as a
 
04:11:41.510 --> 04:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
representation of our need and it's not
 
04:11:43.510 --> 04:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
just our security staff that use it as a
 
04:11:45.910 --> 04:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
communication tool it's our group two
 
04:11:47.429 --> 04:11:47.439 align:start position:0%
correctional line personnel that use
 
04:11:48.630 --> 04:11:48.640 align:start position:0%
that as well because they are
 
04:11:50.149 --> 04:11:50.159 align:start position:0%
independent and doing their group work
 
04:11:51.510 --> 04:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
and other healthcare work throughout the
 
04:11:53.429 --> 04:11:53.439 align:start position:0%
institution do you want to speak more to
 
04:11:53.439 --> 04:11:54.950 align:start position:0%
institution do you want to speak more to
the

04:11:54.950 --> 04:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:11:56.710 --> 04:11:56.720 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner so the radio
 
04:11:58.309 --> 04:11:58.319 align:start position:0%
system we've looked at many different
 
04:11:59.670 --> 04:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
ways um
 
04:12:01.830 --> 04:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
it's a and as the radio folks with
 
04:12:03.269 --> 04:12:03.279 align:start position:0%
department of safety were here earlier
 
04:12:05.269 --> 04:12:05.279 align:start position:0%
today would tell you um
 
04:12:05.279 --> 04:12:06.070 align:start position:0%
today would tell you um
that

04:12:06.070 --> 04:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:12:09.189 --> 04:12:09.199 align:start position:0%
that's the the older radio systems vhf
 
04:12:11.429 --> 04:12:11.439 align:start position:0%
155 megahertz systems
 
04:12:11.439 --> 04:12:12.229 align:start position:0%
155 megahertz systems
um

04:12:12.229 --> 04:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:13.590 --> 04:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't always penetrate through the
 
04:12:16.710 --> 04:12:16.720 align:start position:0%
concrete um it is the type of system
 
04:12:18.870 --> 04:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
that's not totally reliable it can be
 
04:12:21.110 --> 04:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
monitored by anyone
 
04:12:23.670 --> 04:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
it can also be interfered now by people
 
04:12:25.110 --> 04:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
which has been happening over the last
 
04:12:26.790 --> 04:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
year or two we'll be in the middle of
 
04:12:28.389 --> 04:12:28.399 align:start position:0%
something somebody
 
04:12:31.030 --> 04:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
various behavior outside the facility or
 
04:12:32.870 --> 04:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
somewhere we can't pinpoint has grabbed
 
04:12:34.469 --> 04:12:34.479 align:start position:0%
a radio with that frequency and is
 
04:12:36.469 --> 04:12:36.479 align:start position:0%
holding the mic while we're saying
 
04:12:38.309 --> 04:12:38.319 align:start position:0%
get people to shoot as soon as
 
04:12:40.389 --> 04:12:40.399 align:start position:0%
and then we've got nothing and as soon
 
04:12:42.710 --> 04:12:42.720 align:start position:0%
as possible as soon as next week
 
04:12:44.870 --> 04:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
what's the emergency we also can
 
04:12:47.030 --> 04:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
identify who's calling on the radio we
 
04:12:49.429 --> 04:12:49.439 align:start position:0%
have no idea they could be in a 20 mile
 
04:12:51.110 --> 04:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
radius because that
 
04:12:52.630 --> 04:12:52.640 align:start position:0%
that wattage on that radio is that
 
04:12:54.469 --> 04:12:54.479 align:start position:0%
strong in some cases they could be way
 
04:12:56.229 --> 04:12:56.239 align:start position:0%
outside the facility
 
04:12:58.550 --> 04:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
the other thing too is that the prison
 
04:13:00.790 --> 04:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
runs on communication
 
04:13:00.800 --> 04:13:01.830 align:start position:0%
runs on communication
that

04:13:01.830 --> 04:13:01.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:13:04.070 --> 04:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
is a system where we cannot bring cell
 
04:13:05.910 --> 04:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
phones smartphones those things inside
 
04:13:07.990 --> 04:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
the facility and text somebody oh i
 
04:13:09.590 --> 04:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
think this inmate's gonna have a problem
 
04:13:11.030 --> 04:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
that that doesn't happen in their prison
 
04:13:13.510 --> 04:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
environment so that is the first line of
 
04:13:15.910 --> 04:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
communication for safety within a prison
 
04:13:17.750 --> 04:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
facility it's very unique
 
04:13:17.760 --> 04:13:18.630 align:start position:0%
facility it's very unique
um

04:13:18.630 --> 04:13:18.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:19.910 --> 04:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
and the other problem we have beyond
 
04:13:22.070 --> 04:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
that is not only the older systems the
 
04:13:23.510 --> 04:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
handheld but the older systems in the
 
04:13:25.670 --> 04:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
mobile units so we leave shelburne uh
 
04:13:28.950 --> 04:13:28.960 align:start position:0%
sorry we leave berlin in a uh in a
 
04:13:31.110 --> 04:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
van transport van as we call it with
 
04:13:33.830 --> 04:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
resident inmates in the back and there
 
04:13:36.550 --> 04:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
is a myriad of dead spots as you go
 
04:13:38.710 --> 04:13:38.720 align:start position:0%
through shelburne as you go back down
 
04:13:38.720 --> 04:13:39.830 align:start position:0%
through shelburne as you go back down
across

04:13:39.830 --> 04:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
across
 
04:13:39.840 --> 04:13:41.269 align:start position:0%
across
into

04:13:41.269 --> 04:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
into
 
04:13:44.469 --> 04:13:44.479 align:start position:0%
franconia and down the line we can't get
 
04:13:47.030 --> 04:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
emergency signals out and that's
 
04:13:49.110 --> 04:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
very serious so what's happened is a lot
 
04:13:51.750 --> 04:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
of our ceos are actually grabbing their
 
04:13:54.070 --> 04:13:54.080 align:start position:0%
own cell phones and making calls it's
 
04:13:55.830 --> 04:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
just not the professional way to do that
 
04:13:57.590 --> 04:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
and this would include something like
 
04:13:57.600 --> 04:14:01.670 align:start position:0%
and this would include something like
that

04:14:01.670 --> 04:14:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:03.750 --> 04:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
so as we go to page nine we continue to
 
04:14:05.830 --> 04:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
show the steam lines and traps that
 
04:14:08.070 --> 04:14:08.080 align:start position:0%
continue need to be replaced and this is
 
04:14:09.670 --> 04:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
additional money to see that project
 
04:14:12.550 --> 04:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
through from the last cycle
 
04:14:14.149 --> 04:14:14.159 align:start position:0%
it's just more rusty than it was the
 
04:14:16.469 --> 04:14:16.479 align:start position:0%
last time you saw this photo
 
04:14:18.790 --> 04:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
on page 10 we continue to show you the
 
04:14:21.510 --> 04:14:21.520 align:start position:0%
sewer line grinder that is
 
04:14:23.990 --> 04:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
is that on the street north state street
 
04:14:25.750 --> 04:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
yeah i can explain a little bit yeah so
 
04:14:27.910 --> 04:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
this is my least favorite conversation
 
04:14:29.510 --> 04:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
yeah this
 
04:14:31.510 --> 04:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
this is the sewer grinder aka known as
 
04:14:33.429 --> 04:14:33.439 align:start position:0%
the muffin monster that is the brand
 
04:14:35.990 --> 04:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
manufacturer for that product
 
04:14:37.750 --> 04:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
this was something we're working
 
04:14:39.990 --> 04:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
hand-in-hand with the city on we need to
 
04:14:42.229 --> 04:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
get our line away from their main line
 
04:14:43.910 --> 04:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
so we don't keep sending
 
04:14:46.389 --> 04:14:46.399 align:start position:0%
trash all the way down to
 
04:14:47.830 --> 04:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
hall street where the wastewater
 
04:14:49.590 --> 04:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
treatment plant is and that is a direct
 
04:14:51.750 --> 04:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
line down along the side of merrimack
 
04:14:53.510 --> 04:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
river and they call us on a regular
 
04:14:54.870 --> 04:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
basis and say
 
04:14:56.309 --> 04:14:56.319 align:start position:0%
we've got things that look like they
 
04:14:58.469 --> 04:14:58.479 align:start position:0%
came from your place i get to go look at
 
04:14:59.750 --> 04:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
them sometimes and they have the
 
04:15:01.670 --> 04:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
inmate's name on them so yes that came
 
04:15:03.830 --> 04:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
from us they do flush things down so
 
04:15:05.030 --> 04:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
what we're doing is bringing that
 
04:15:06.950 --> 04:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
offline the reason for the more money
 
04:15:08.149 --> 04:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
and the reason we're here for the more
 
04:15:10.630 --> 04:15:10.640 align:start position:0%
money is that it will
 
04:15:12.389 --> 04:15:12.399 align:start position:0%
according to our latest estimates come
 
04:15:14.710 --> 04:15:14.720 align:start position:0%
directly through our parking lot at the
 
04:15:16.309 --> 04:15:16.319 align:start position:0%
men's prison and there will be building
 
04:15:18.389 --> 04:15:18.399 align:start position:0%
built that's larger that we expected to
 
04:15:20.550 --> 04:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
put the auger and the muffin monster in
 
04:15:22.469 --> 04:15:22.479 align:start position:0%
to pull that trash out so to get the
 
04:15:25.030 --> 04:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
proper place instead of sending it down
 
04:15:26.710 --> 04:15:26.720 align:start position:0%
down holster
 
04:15:27.910 --> 04:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:15:30.149 --> 04:15:30.159 align:start position:0%
i have been asked could we stop
 
04:15:31.910 --> 04:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
individuals from putting things into the
 
04:15:33.510 --> 04:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
plumbing and unfortunately not with the
 
04:15:35.269 --> 04:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
number of beds with we don't have the
 
04:15:39.030 --> 04:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
ability to monitor that much pipage
 
04:15:41.349 --> 04:15:41.359 align:start position:0%
so moving on to page 11 it continues to
 
04:15:43.269 --> 04:15:43.279 align:start position:0%
upgrade our security and perimeter
 
04:15:45.189 --> 04:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
detection system again this is to see
 
04:15:47.030 --> 04:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
that project to completion for all the
 
04:15:49.590 --> 04:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
same reasons we asked for last year
 
04:15:52.469 --> 04:15:52.479 align:start position:0%
it is a i will use the term hodgepodge
 
04:15:55.269 --> 04:15:55.279 align:start position:0%
of different materials fencing metal
 
04:15:57.189 --> 04:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
fencing brick
 
04:15:58.870 --> 04:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
you name it it is part of our secure
 
04:16:00.710 --> 04:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
perimeter and it is important to make
 
04:16:02.550 --> 04:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
sure that secure perimeter functions the
 
04:16:04.389 --> 04:16:04.399 align:start position:0%
way a prison secure
 
04:16:06.870 --> 04:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
perimeter functions with wave detection
 
04:16:09.590 --> 04:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
and all all the other items necessary
 
04:16:09.600 --> 04:16:10.710 align:start position:0%
and all all the other items necessary
especially

04:16:10.710 --> 04:16:10.720 align:start position:0%
especially
 
04:16:12.469 --> 04:16:12.479 align:start position:0%
with our staffing we need those alarms
 
04:16:14.149 --> 04:16:14.159 align:start position:0%
to actually be triggered because there
 
04:16:15.990 --> 04:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
is a threat there and not to be
 
04:16:17.429 --> 04:16:17.439 align:start position:0%
triggered because there's an error
 
04:16:19.110 --> 04:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
because of the age of the system we want
 
04:16:21.189 --> 04:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
to use our staff efficiently and we
 
04:16:22.950 --> 04:16:22.960 align:start position:0%
don't want anyone becoming complacent
 
04:16:24.309 --> 04:16:24.319 align:start position:0%
because the system doesn't work
 
04:16:26.469 --> 04:16:26.479 align:start position:0%
effectively and they say oh that's just
 
04:16:27.590 --> 04:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
an error
 
04:16:29.510 --> 04:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
so we just need to continue to finish
 
04:16:31.110 --> 04:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
that project and see it to its
 
04:16:31.120 --> 04:16:33.110 align:start position:0%
that project and see it to its
conclusion

04:16:33.110 --> 04:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
conclusion
 
04:16:35.269 --> 04:16:35.279 align:start position:0%
and then on page 12
 
04:16:37.429 --> 04:16:37.439 align:start position:0%
this is again to create parity in our
 
04:16:39.510 --> 04:16:39.520 align:start position:0%
vocational programs between women who
 
04:16:40.870 --> 04:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
are incarcerated and men who are
 
04:16:43.269 --> 04:16:43.279 align:start position:0%
incarcerated and this is the additional
 
04:16:44.790 --> 04:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
money to see that
 
04:16:47.910 --> 04:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
what is uh strife to be planned to be a
 
04:16:50.070 --> 04:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
building trades program for women to
 
04:16:52.469 --> 04:16:52.479 align:start position:0%
help build their job skills and reduce
 
04:16:54.950 --> 04:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
recidivism and and help people move on
 
04:16:57.349 --> 04:16:57.359 align:start position:0%
to employment which will ultimately help
 
04:16:59.269 --> 04:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
our employers in new hampshire with
 
04:17:01.830 --> 04:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
viable employees
 
04:17:03.750 --> 04:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
anything you would like to add john
 
04:17:04.790 --> 04:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
the only
 
04:17:06.229 --> 04:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
time thank you
 
04:17:07.830 --> 04:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
the only thing with the the women's
 
04:17:09.910 --> 04:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
design we came in we thought we had had
 
04:17:11.429 --> 04:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
plenty of money to do that project and
 
04:17:12.950 --> 04:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
we didn't possibly have that much money
 
04:17:15.429 --> 04:17:15.439 align:start position:0%
in 2018 dollars but when those estimates
 
04:17:16.870 --> 04:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
came in they came way up high and you'll
 
04:17:18.870 --> 04:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
also see in the picture
 
04:17:20.550 --> 04:17:20.560 align:start position:0%
if you were here last time you saw we
 
04:17:22.950 --> 04:17:22.960 align:start position:0%
wanted it inside the secure perimeter
 
04:17:25.189 --> 04:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
that location was not conducive to where
 
04:17:27.349 --> 04:17:27.359 align:start position:0%
the utilities were so we saved some
 
04:17:29.110 --> 04:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
money by moving it outside the perimeter
 
04:17:31.189 --> 04:17:31.199 align:start position:0%
into a control fence area so that we
 
04:17:32.710 --> 04:17:32.720 align:start position:0%
could connect the utilities and as it
 
04:17:34.229 --> 04:17:34.239 align:start position:0%
turned out
 
04:17:35.830 --> 04:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
that would cost us more money in the
 
04:17:37.429 --> 04:17:37.439 align:start position:0%
long run to connect to everything from
 
04:17:38.950 --> 04:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
that point back to the sewer line the
 
04:17:40.790 --> 04:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
electrical lines and the building
 
04:17:42.469 --> 04:17:42.479 align:start position:0%
expanded because we added some more
 
04:17:45.189 --> 04:17:45.199 align:start position:0%
trades to be uh in the training of the
 
04:17:48.870 --> 04:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:50.630 --> 04:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
so with that we certainly appreciate any
 
04:17:53.030 --> 04:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
questions or comments
 
04:17:54.469 --> 04:17:54.479 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:17:57.830 --> 04:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
my first question is relates to
 
04:17:59.269 --> 04:17:59.279 align:start position:0%
the men's prison
 
04:18:01.670 --> 04:18:01.680 align:start position:0%
and i mean up here we have two branches
 
04:18:03.189 --> 04:18:03.199 align:start position:0%
of government represented the executive
 
04:18:04.830 --> 04:18:04.840 align:start position:0%
and and the
 
04:18:07.750 --> 04:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
legislature what role
 
04:18:12.389 --> 04:18:12.399 align:start position:0%
would the judicial play in this if uh
 
04:18:14.469 --> 04:18:14.479 align:start position:0%
a new prison is not built at what point
 
04:18:17.269 --> 04:18:17.279 align:start position:0%
do they step in and say
 
04:18:21.030 --> 04:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
it is unsatisfactory we need this x y
 
04:18:23.110 --> 04:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
and z to happen have there been any sort
 
04:18:25.269 --> 04:18:25.279 align:start position:0%
of discussions with the judiciary on
 
04:18:26.469 --> 04:18:26.479 align:start position:0%
that or
 
04:18:28.229 --> 04:18:28.239 align:start position:0%
is that something you would anticipate
 
04:18:30.870 --> 04:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
might be coming in the future
 
04:18:32.790 --> 04:18:32.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question i think
 
04:18:34.469 --> 04:18:34.479 align:start position:0%
the track record of the agency has
 
04:18:36.070 --> 04:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
already demonstrated those things to
 
04:18:37.429 --> 04:18:37.439 align:start position:0%
come to fruition
 
04:18:39.269 --> 04:18:39.279 align:start position:0%
that includes the holiday court order in
 
04:18:40.870 --> 04:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
which we were ordered to construct a
 
04:18:42.950 --> 04:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
residential treatment unit and rather
 
04:18:44.469 --> 04:18:44.479 align:start position:0%
than taking a hold of it and doing it
 
04:18:46.710 --> 04:18:46.720 align:start position:0%
ourselves we could have created a
 
04:18:48.229 --> 04:18:48.239 align:start position:0%
residential treatment unit without
 
04:18:50.229 --> 04:18:50.239 align:start position:0%
spending approximately 5 million dollars
 
04:18:52.389 --> 04:18:52.399 align:start position:0%
on a 40 bed unit
 
04:18:54.710 --> 04:18:54.720 align:start position:0%
in addition to that there was a stay on
 
04:18:55.990 --> 04:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
the litigation with regard to the
 
04:18:57.830 --> 04:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
women's prison because the state funded
 
04:19:00.070 --> 04:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
the 52 million dollar women's prison
 
04:19:00.080 --> 04:19:01.349 align:start position:0%
the 52 million dollar women's prison
facility

04:19:01.349 --> 04:19:01.359 align:start position:0%
facility
 
04:19:02.870 --> 04:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
we're always better served to be ahead
 
04:19:04.950 --> 04:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
of it before we're ordered to do it the
 
04:19:08.149 --> 04:19:08.159 align:start position:0%
way an advocacy group wants us to do it
 
04:19:09.750 --> 04:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
it doesn't mean we won't design it
 
04:19:11.429 --> 04:19:11.439 align:start position:0%
effectively as corrections professionals
 
04:19:13.429 --> 04:19:13.439 align:start position:0%
and engineers but we want to have our
 
04:19:15.429 --> 04:19:15.439 align:start position:0%
voice and our experience in it rather
 
04:19:17.510 --> 04:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
than being ordered into it and there are
 
04:19:19.670 --> 04:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
other pieces of uh litigation the llama
 
04:19:22.309 --> 04:19:22.319 align:start position:0%
and consent degree uh lepin is all about
 
04:19:24.790 --> 04:19:24.800 align:start position:0%
programmatic and rehabilitative programs
 
04:19:26.149 --> 04:19:26.159 align:start position:0%
that you know if we don't have the
 
04:19:28.070 --> 04:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
proper infrastructure to deliver then
 
04:19:29.429 --> 04:19:29.439 align:start position:0%
we're going to be ordered to provide
 
04:19:31.189 --> 04:19:31.199 align:start position:0%
that infrastructure
 
04:19:33.750 --> 04:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
so this is our agency saying to the
 
04:19:35.030 --> 04:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
state we're telling you that
 
04:19:36.630 --> 04:19:36.640 align:start position:0%
infrastructure is
 
04:19:39.590 --> 04:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
is is running out of its lifespan
 
04:19:42.710 --> 04:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
the kitchen in and of itself hhs told us
 
04:19:44.550 --> 04:19:44.560 align:start position:0%
we need to replace it or we'll have to
 
04:19:47.189 --> 04:19:47.199 align:start position:0%
shut that thing down and then the secure
 
04:19:49.030 --> 04:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
psychiatric unit for example we need our
 
04:19:51.189 --> 04:19:51.199 align:start position:0%
roofs that are funded or we have
 
04:19:53.030 --> 04:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
partners who have already are already
 
04:19:55.269 --> 04:19:55.279 align:start position:0%
poised to move forward with litigation
 
04:19:57.990 --> 04:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
if those roofs are not resolved so we
 
04:19:59.990 --> 04:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
have a history here and we're trying to
 
04:20:02.710 --> 04:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
not be litigated to get it done
 
04:20:04.870 --> 04:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that building a new
 
04:20:06.790 --> 04:20:06.800 align:start position:0%
facility in the design of which could
 
04:20:09.349 --> 04:20:09.359 align:start position:0%
improve the efficiencies of
 
04:20:12.149 --> 04:20:12.159 align:start position:0%
uh with your dispersed dispersing of
 
04:20:14.229 --> 04:20:14.239 align:start position:0%
security personnel well i know well i
 
04:20:16.070 --> 04:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
realize you don't have the exact design
 
04:20:16.080 --> 04:20:17.110 align:start position:0%
realize you don't have the exact design
yet

04:20:17.110 --> 04:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
yet
 
04:20:19.910 --> 04:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
uh what sort of savings as far as
 
04:20:22.149 --> 04:20:22.159 align:start position:0%
manpower are we talking about
 
04:20:23.830 --> 04:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
given the current design in what you
 
04:20:25.510 --> 04:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
would consider to be an efficient design
 
04:20:27.830 --> 04:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
that would be forthcoming
 
04:20:29.750 --> 04:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the question but i think
 
04:20:32.070 --> 04:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
it's premature in that we're already
 
04:20:33.830 --> 04:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
currently understaffed in the current
 
04:20:36.550 --> 04:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
fiscal layout um and we'd we would have
 
04:20:38.790 --> 04:20:38.800 align:start position:0%
to see it designed and likely the
 
04:20:41.510 --> 04:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
existing staff using it most effectively
 
04:20:42.870 --> 04:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
while continuing to recruit to fill the
 
04:20:45.110 --> 04:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
vacancies we have today right but i
 
04:20:47.269 --> 04:20:47.279 align:start position:0%
think the question more goes to under
 
04:20:48.870 --> 04:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
this facility ideally you would have x
 
04:20:50.149 --> 04:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
number of people
 
04:20:52.309 --> 04:20:52.319 align:start position:0%
and the new facility you could you could
 
04:20:53.670 --> 04:20:53.680 align:start position:0%
staff it with
 
04:20:55.670 --> 04:20:55.680 align:start position:0%
you know something x minus
 
04:20:58.149 --> 04:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
a certain factor certainly but we don't
 
04:21:00.790 --> 04:21:00.800 align:start position:0%
have a design yet and in addition to
 
04:21:02.790 --> 04:21:02.800 align:start position:0%
although we've seen a population decline
 
04:21:04.469 --> 04:21:04.479 align:start position:0%
while we go through this study we have
 
04:21:05.910 --> 04:21:05.920 align:start position:0%
to understand what that pattern of
 
04:21:07.910 --> 04:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
incarceration and recidivism is to
 
04:21:10.070 --> 04:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
forecast the proper number of beds
 
04:21:11.590 --> 04:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of different variables
 
04:21:12.870 --> 04:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
having gone through it with the women's
 
04:21:14.790 --> 04:21:14.800 align:start position:0%
prison that i can certainly dive into
 
04:21:16.550 --> 04:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
deeply but you probably don't want me to
 
04:21:20.149 --> 04:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
do that today okay thank you thank you
 
04:21:20.159 --> 04:21:21.269 align:start position:0%
do that today okay thank you thank you
representative

04:21:21.269 --> 04:21:21.279 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:21:21.279 --> 04:21:22.389 align:start position:0%
representative
um

04:21:22.389 --> 04:21:22.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:24.070 --> 04:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner
 
04:21:26.710 --> 04:21:26.720 align:start position:0%
um and looking at
 
04:21:27.990 --> 04:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
the study
 
04:21:30.070 --> 04:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
why are we only looking at concord it is
 
04:21:31.670 --> 04:21:31.680 align:start position:0%
my understanding
 
04:21:33.990 --> 04:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
that when we built the prison in berlin
 
04:21:36.389 --> 04:21:36.399 align:start position:0%
it was built to be expandable
 
04:21:39.030 --> 04:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
why are we not at least exploring that
 
04:21:41.510 --> 04:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
as part of this option rather than
 
04:21:44.870 --> 04:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
saying it's got to be in conquered
 
04:21:46.870 --> 04:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
a rep graham i think that's a great
 
04:21:46.880 --> 04:21:48.630 align:start position:0%
a rep graham i think that's a great
question

04:21:48.630 --> 04:21:48.640 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:21:50.790 --> 04:21:50.800 align:start position:0%
we could we certainly would include that
 
04:21:53.189 --> 04:21:53.199 align:start position:0%
in a feasibility study we've always
 
04:21:55.670 --> 04:21:55.680 align:start position:0%
balanced the actual availability of
 
04:21:55.680 --> 04:21:56.790 align:start position:0%
balanced the actual availability of
personnel

04:21:56.790 --> 04:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
personnel
 
04:21:58.870 --> 04:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
so for example if we moved all of our
 
04:22:01.590 --> 04:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
men's prison operations to berlin would
 
04:22:03.750 --> 04:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
there be enough employees actually to
 
04:22:05.750 --> 04:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
fulfill the obligation
 
04:22:07.590 --> 04:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
and we even went through that balanced
 
04:22:09.750 --> 04:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
conversation when we were going to build
 
04:22:11.429 --> 04:22:11.439 align:start position:0%
the women's prison so i think it's a
 
04:22:13.830 --> 04:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
great question and we'll include
 
04:22:15.349 --> 04:22:15.359 align:start position:0%
what kind of expansion effort we can
 
04:22:17.510 --> 04:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
engage in up there but i do think we
 
04:22:19.750 --> 04:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
balance that we are a
 
04:22:21.670 --> 04:22:21.680 align:start position:0%
broad geographic state even though we're
 
04:22:23.750 --> 04:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
small and we need that employee cadre as
 
04:22:23.760 --> 04:22:27.830 align:start position:0%
small and we need that employee cadre as
well

04:22:27.830 --> 04:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:30.830 --> 04:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
um i have a couple of high
 
04:22:33.349 --> 04:22:33.359 align:start position:0%
um i have a couple of questions one how
 
04:22:36.630 --> 04:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
many guests do you currently have
 
04:22:39.110 --> 04:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
in your various facilities
 
04:22:39.120 --> 04:22:40.149 align:start position:0%
in your various facilities
well

04:22:40.149 --> 04:22:40.159 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:22:41.870 --> 04:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
we have
 
04:22:45.030 --> 04:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
1884 people in our prison facilities and
 
04:22:47.510 --> 04:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
transitional housing facilities today we
 
04:22:50.070 --> 04:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
have just under 6 000 under supervision
 
04:22:52.149 --> 04:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
on probation and parole so how so how
 
04:22:54.070 --> 04:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
big is the men's prison if i said that
 
04:22:55.670 --> 04:22:55.680 align:start position:0%
you hey how big is the men's prison in
 
04:22:55.680 --> 04:22:56.550 align:start position:0%
you hey how big is the men's prison in
concord

04:22:56.550 --> 04:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
concord
 
04:22:58.469 --> 04:22:58.479 align:start position:0%
what would you say so the
 
04:23:02.149 --> 04:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
so the current capacity is 1380
 
04:23:04.309 --> 04:23:04.319 align:start position:0%
which we've exceeded by putting bunk
 
04:23:06.950 --> 04:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
beds in places designed to be day rooms
 
04:23:09.110 --> 04:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
um and then rooms that were designed to
 
04:23:11.189 --> 04:23:11.199 align:start position:0%
be six person rooms we converted those
 
04:23:12.950 --> 04:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
to eight person rooms as far back as
 
04:23:15.269 --> 04:23:15.279 align:start position:0%
2009 but it's about it's about 1380 how
 
04:23:16.790 --> 04:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
big is the women's prison
 
04:23:19.990 --> 04:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
that has 227 beds
 
04:23:22.070 --> 04:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
four 224.
 
04:23:24.229 --> 04:23:24.239 align:start position:0%
okay he corrected me my you're close
 
04:23:24.239 --> 04:23:25.510 align:start position:0%
okay he corrected me my you're close
yeah

04:23:25.510 --> 04:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:23:27.429 --> 04:23:27.439 align:start position:0%
how big is berlin
 
04:23:30.870 --> 04:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
that yeah it's designed for 500 we've
 
04:23:33.590 --> 04:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
had it as high as 630
 
04:23:35.510 --> 04:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
again back when the population was high
 
04:23:38.550 --> 04:23:38.560 align:start position:0%
in 2010 2011 uh put bunk beds in one of
 
04:23:40.950 --> 04:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
the gymnasiums
 
04:23:43.750 --> 04:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
oh great but it's designed for 500. yes
 
04:23:45.910 --> 04:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
like you wouldn't want more than 500. no
 
04:23:47.990 --> 04:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
and i believe our account there is 535
 
04:23:49.750 --> 04:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
so we still have more than it's designed
 
04:23:49.760 --> 04:23:50.550 align:start position:0%
so we still have more than it's designed
for

04:23:50.550 --> 04:23:50.560 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:23:53.030 --> 04:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
do you have a sense that your um
 
04:23:54.870 --> 04:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
population is i know a lot of this is
 
04:23:57.189 --> 04:23:57.199 align:start position:0%
determined by legislation but
 
04:23:59.750 --> 04:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
your population is likely to keep
 
04:24:02.389 --> 04:24:02.399 align:start position:0%
rising or slowing or
 
04:24:04.870 --> 04:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
so we've seen approximately a 28
 
04:24:07.189 --> 04:24:07.199 align:start position:0%
decline in the incarcerated population
 
04:24:09.030 --> 04:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
over the last 15 years so even though we
 
04:24:12.030 --> 04:24:12.040 align:start position:0%
had a spike in 2010 2011
 
04:24:14.550 --> 04:24:14.560 align:start position:0%
pre-covered this state through the
 
04:24:16.389 --> 04:24:16.399 align:start position:0%
implementation of drug court and other
 
04:24:18.550 --> 04:24:18.560 align:start position:0%
diversion and intervention
 
04:24:20.870 --> 04:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
approaches has reduced the incarceration
 
04:24:23.269 --> 04:24:23.279 align:start position:0%
rate and when i say that i mean new
 
04:24:24.790 --> 04:24:24.800 align:start position:0%
crime admission rate as well as
 
04:24:26.630 --> 04:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
violation rates
 
04:24:29.510 --> 04:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
so we are actually in a good place at
 
04:24:31.510 --> 04:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
this point um it would be hard to
 
04:24:33.750 --> 04:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
predict predict what comes each year
 
04:24:36.389 --> 04:24:36.399 align:start position:0%
after year but it's a 28 decline over
 
04:24:39.110 --> 04:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
the last 15 years and you think that's
 
04:24:39.120 --> 04:24:39.490 align:start position:0%
the last 15 years and you think that's
um

04:24:39.490 --> 04:24:39.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:39.500 --> 04:24:40.710 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

04:24:40.710 --> 04:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:24:41.830 --> 04:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
i don't know what the right word is
 
04:24:43.990 --> 04:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
apples to apples sort of i mean i know
 
04:24:46.389 --> 04:24:46.399 align:start position:0%
you can't really compare things but like
 
04:24:47.830 --> 04:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
adjusted for
 
04:24:49.670 --> 04:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
i don't know population differences or
 
04:24:51.189 --> 04:24:51.199 align:start position:0%
you think a lot of that's attributable
 
04:24:54.469 --> 04:24:54.479 align:start position:0%
to the to the way we do corrections
 
04:24:56.309 --> 04:24:56.319 align:start position:0%
i think it's attributable to the things
 
04:24:58.309 --> 04:24:58.319 align:start position:0%
we've done both at the local level to
 
04:25:00.149 --> 04:25:00.159 align:start position:0%
provide access to treatment services
 
04:25:01.910 --> 04:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
specifically substance use disorder
 
04:25:01.920 --> 04:25:03.189 align:start position:0%
specifically substance use disorder
treatment

04:25:03.189 --> 04:25:03.199 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
04:25:05.429 --> 04:25:05.439 align:start position:0%
changes that the judiciary is engaged in
 
04:25:07.910 --> 04:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
to create specialty courts and i also
 
04:25:09.990 --> 04:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
think that judges are
 
04:25:11.670 --> 04:25:11.680 align:start position:0%
you know they take the action very
 
04:25:14.630 --> 04:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
seriously balancing punishment and uh
 
04:25:17.110 --> 04:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
diversion when it's appropriate
 
04:25:19.590 --> 04:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
if if you were full today in the three
 
04:25:19.600 --> 04:25:21.750 align:start position:0%
if if you were full today in the three
facilities

04:25:21.750 --> 04:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
04:25:21.760 --> 04:25:23.269 align:start position:0%
facilities
how

04:25:23.269 --> 04:25:23.279 align:start position:0%
how
 
04:25:25.670 --> 04:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
how bad would your staffing be like how
 
04:25:27.990 --> 04:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
low would we be
 
04:25:30.550 --> 04:25:30.560 align:start position:0%
so last july that's a great question i
 
04:25:32.389 --> 04:25:32.399 align:start position:0%
was able to shut down the second floor
 
04:25:35.750 --> 04:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
of hancock building that's 196 beds that
 
04:25:37.750 --> 04:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
means there were 14 posts we didn't have
 
04:25:40.389 --> 04:25:40.399 align:start position:0%
to fill and then this year we were able
 
04:25:43.110 --> 04:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
to shut down one of the 56 bed c3
 
04:25:45.429 --> 04:25:45.439 align:start position:0%
women's units so that's five positions
 
04:25:47.349 --> 04:25:47.359 align:start position:0%
we didn't need to fill if we have to
 
04:25:49.189 --> 04:25:49.199 align:start position:0%
open those because we were already
 
04:25:51.910 --> 04:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
understaffed meaning the proper number
 
04:25:51.920 --> 04:25:52.710 align:start position:0%
understaffed meaning the proper number
of

04:25:52.710 --> 04:25:52.720 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:25:54.469 --> 04:25:54.479 align:start position:0%
positions we're not filled to function
 
04:25:57.269 --> 04:25:57.279 align:start position:0%
at the capacity we are today
 
04:25:59.189 --> 04:25:59.199 align:start position:0%
again i i would be asking for other
 
04:26:01.030 --> 04:26:01.040 align:start position:0%
resources within the state to continue
 
04:26:03.510 --> 04:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
to run our operations and then to follow
 
04:26:05.910 --> 04:26:05.920 align:start position:0%
up on that uh in terms of resources you
 
04:26:07.670 --> 04:26:07.680 align:start position:0%
have today and i know there are a lot of
 
04:26:09.990 --> 04:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
triage techniques right and related to
 
04:26:12.070 --> 04:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
overtime and whatnot but
 
04:26:13.750 --> 04:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
comfortably speaking how many more
 
04:26:16.469 --> 04:26:16.479 align:start position:0%
correction officers would you need to be
 
04:26:18.389 --> 04:26:18.399 align:start position:0%
at an appropriate staffing level for
 
04:26:18.399 --> 04:26:19.670 align:start position:0%
at an appropriate staffing level for
today

04:26:19.670 --> 04:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
today
 
04:26:21.910 --> 04:26:21.920 align:start position:0%
for today with the population we have
 
04:26:24.149 --> 04:26:24.159 align:start position:0%
today yeah
 
04:26:25.510 --> 04:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
and this doesn't
 
04:26:27.830 --> 04:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
so we have a hundred and
 
04:26:30.070 --> 04:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
eighty two security vacancies i would
 
04:26:32.309 --> 04:26:32.319 align:start position:0%
need them all filled and then looking at
 
04:26:36.389 --> 04:26:36.399 align:start position:0%
the 2012 lba audit of our security posts
 
04:26:37.990 --> 04:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
i would be coming back asking for more
 
04:26:40.070 --> 04:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
positions to create relief factor which
 
04:26:43.110 --> 04:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
we don't have in our staffing regiment
 
04:26:49.030 --> 04:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:50.710 --> 04:26:50.720 align:start position:0%
one of the follow-up question
 
04:26:50.720 --> 04:26:52.149 align:start position:0%
one of the follow-up question
uh

04:26:52.149 --> 04:26:52.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:26:52.159 --> 04:26:52.950 align:start position:0%
uh
the

04:26:52.950 --> 04:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:26:52.960 --> 04:26:54.070 align:start position:0%
the
uh

04:26:54.070 --> 04:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:26:56.149 --> 04:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
the men's prison and the renovation for
 
04:26:57.990 --> 04:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
the kitchen that that's not in either or
 
04:27:00.309 --> 04:27:00.319 align:start position:0%
you need both because of the priority of
 
04:27:01.590 --> 04:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
these so it's not someone who couldn't
 
04:27:02.790 --> 04:27:02.800 align:start position:0%
think well we're going to build a new
 
04:27:04.309 --> 04:27:04.319 align:start position:0%
prison anyway so why do we need a new
 
04:27:06.550 --> 04:27:06.560 align:start position:0%
kitchen you need the kitchen
 
04:27:08.950 --> 04:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
and i needed the kitchen like six years
 
04:27:13.670 --> 04:27:13.680 align:start position:0%
ago right yeah okay thank you
 
04:27:15.510 --> 04:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
good thank you very much
 
04:27:24.229 --> 04:27:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:26.389 --> 04:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
uh next on the agenda uh which will
 
04:27:28.469 --> 04:27:28.479 align:start position:0%
begin in three minutes is the police
 
04:27:29.830 --> 04:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
standards and training councils like to
 
04:27:31.030 --> 04:27:31.040 align:start position:0%
invite them up
 
04:27:42.389 --> 04:27:42.399 align:start position:0%

we're here today to talk about
 
04:29:35.680 --> 04:29:37.429 align:start position:0%
we're here today to talk about
two

04:29:37.429 --> 04:29:37.439 align:start position:0%
two
 
04:29:39.910 --> 04:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
capital improvement projects for your
 
04:29:39.920 --> 04:29:41.590 align:start position:0%
capital improvement projects for your
consideration

04:29:41.590 --> 04:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
04:29:45.030 --> 04:29:45.040 align:start position:0%
while i've handed my full text out to
 
04:29:47.990 --> 04:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
the members of this committee
 
04:29:50.870 --> 04:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
i'd like to just kind of jump right to
 
04:29:55.429 --> 04:29:55.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:55.439 --> 04:29:56.790 align:start position:0%
 
presently

04:29:56.790 --> 04:29:56.800 align:start position:0%
presently
 
04:30:00.469 --> 04:30:00.479 align:start position:0%
we are experiencing a
 
04:30:03.269 --> 04:30:03.279 align:start position:0%
space shortage
 
04:30:05.750 --> 04:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
to a degree that it impacts our ability
 
04:30:07.670 --> 04:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
to deliver
 
04:30:10.229 --> 04:30:10.239 align:start position:0%
both recruit training and in-service
 
04:30:11.750 --> 04:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
training for all new hampshire law
 
04:30:13.910 --> 04:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers in the state of new
 
04:30:13.920 --> 04:30:15.750 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers in the state of new
hampshire

04:30:15.750 --> 04:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
04:30:17.750 --> 04:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
specifically we are asking for your
 
04:30:20.870 --> 04:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
consideration for two projects
 
04:30:22.790 --> 04:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
the first project
 
04:30:22.800 --> 04:30:24.950 align:start position:0%
the first project
is

04:30:24.950 --> 04:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:30:28.389 --> 04:30:28.399 align:start position:0%
allowing us or will allow us to move
 
04:30:28.399 --> 04:30:29.750 align:start position:0%
allowing us or will allow us to move
a

04:30:29.750 --> 04:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:30:32.309 --> 04:30:32.319 align:start position:0%
training simulator from
 
04:30:34.149 --> 04:30:34.159 align:start position:0%
two classrooms
 
04:30:37.110 --> 04:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
to an out building that already exists
 
04:30:38.950 --> 04:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
so that we can reclaim those two
 
04:30:38.960 --> 04:30:41.030 align:start position:0%
so that we can reclaim those two
classrooms

04:30:41.030 --> 04:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
classrooms
 
04:30:45.349 --> 04:30:45.359 align:start position:0%
uh back in uh 2000
 
04:30:51.030 --> 04:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:55.510 --> 04:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
i think it was 2014 2013 i'm sorry
 
04:30:58.870 --> 04:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
we were fortunate enough to uh obtain
 
04:31:01.030 --> 04:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
a device called a virtra
 
04:31:03.510 --> 04:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
which is a 360
 
04:31:03.520 --> 04:31:04.389 align:start position:0%
which is a 360
uh

04:31:04.389 --> 04:31:04.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:31:06.710 --> 04:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
training device that
 
04:31:10.550 --> 04:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
is very very low cost very safe and it
 
04:31:13.110 --> 04:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
helps officers uh train and practice and
 
04:31:15.269 --> 04:31:15.279 align:start position:0%
de-escalation techniques and firearms
 
04:31:15.279 --> 04:31:16.950 align:start position:0%
de-escalation techniques and firearms
techniques

04:31:16.950 --> 04:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
techniques
 
04:31:18.550 --> 04:31:18.560 align:start position:0%
uh that device
 
04:31:20.630 --> 04:31:20.640 align:start position:0%
hovered right around 350 thousand
 
04:31:20.640 --> 04:31:21.750 align:start position:0%
hovered right around 350 thousand
dollars

04:31:21.750 --> 04:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:31:24.070 --> 04:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
for us to purchase we were able to
 
04:31:27.910 --> 04:31:27.920 align:start position:0%
exercise a grant to purchase that
 
04:31:30.630 --> 04:31:30.640 align:start position:0%
i think the the purchase came uh with
 
04:31:32.469 --> 04:31:32.479 align:start position:0%
the realization that the device had to
 
04:31:35.110 --> 04:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
be put somewhere in the building
 
04:31:39.349 --> 04:31:39.359 align:start position:0%
and so the decision was made to
 
04:31:41.750 --> 04:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
use two classrooms that are next to each
 
04:31:41.760 --> 04:31:43.429 align:start position:0%
use two classrooms that are next to each
other

04:31:43.429 --> 04:31:43.439 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:31:45.910 --> 04:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
and reconfigure that classroom to hold
 
04:31:49.189 --> 04:31:49.199 align:start position:0%
this device in so that it can be used
 
04:31:52.389 --> 04:31:52.399 align:start position:0%
the device is used about 25 percent of
 
04:31:56.070 --> 04:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:58.710 --> 04:31:58.720 align:start position:0%
our hope is that we would be able to
 
04:32:00.389 --> 04:32:00.399 align:start position:0%
take that device
 
04:32:02.630 --> 04:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
uh move it out of the main building into
 
04:32:04.229 --> 04:32:04.239 align:start position:0%
an existing
 
04:32:08.070 --> 04:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
garage really and then reclaim that
 
04:32:09.910 --> 04:32:09.920 align:start position:0%
classroom space which is desperately
 
04:32:09.920 --> 04:32:13.670 align:start position:0%
classroom space which is desperately
needed

04:32:13.670 --> 04:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:16.070 --> 04:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
the second project would be to take an
 
04:32:16.080 --> 04:32:18.309 align:start position:0%
the second project would be to take an
existing

04:32:18.309 --> 04:32:18.319 align:start position:0%
existing
 
04:32:20.870 --> 04:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
what we call a break room uh back in the
 
04:32:22.550 --> 04:32:22.560 align:start position:0%
old days when i went through the police
 
04:32:25.269 --> 04:32:25.279 align:start position:0%
academy this was our uh tactical
 
04:32:28.070 --> 04:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
training center uh the room was probably
 
04:32:30.710 --> 04:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
about half the size of this room
 
04:32:33.830 --> 04:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
and uh because of additions that came
 
04:32:36.790 --> 04:32:36.800 align:start position:0%
after the initial construction
 
04:32:38.149 --> 04:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
this space
 
04:32:40.710 --> 04:32:40.720 align:start position:0%
really now is kind of used as a bit of a
 
04:32:42.149 --> 04:32:42.159 align:start position:0%
break room
 
04:32:44.870 --> 04:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
and kind of a staging area for scenario
 
04:32:46.790 --> 04:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
training but otherwise it's a
 
04:32:48.710 --> 04:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
significant amount of space that's
 
04:32:48.720 --> 04:32:51.429 align:start position:0%
significant amount of space that's
wasted

04:32:51.429 --> 04:32:51.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:54.550 --> 04:32:54.560 align:start position:0%
we feel that these two projects
 
04:32:57.269 --> 04:32:57.279 align:start position:0%
will allow us to in the first instance
 
04:32:59.110 --> 04:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
reclaim two classrooms that we
 
04:33:00.630 --> 04:33:00.640 align:start position:0%
desperately need
 
04:33:03.030 --> 04:33:03.040 align:start position:0%
and then create a third classroom and
 
04:33:05.349 --> 04:33:05.359 align:start position:0%
some office space again
 
04:33:09.670 --> 04:33:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:11.590 --> 04:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
we think that this is kind of a fiscally
 
04:33:14.789 --> 04:33:14.799 align:start position:0%
responsible way to do this in that
 
04:33:17.429 --> 04:33:17.439 align:start position:0%
we're going to remain in the existing
 
04:33:19.349 --> 04:33:19.359 align:start position:0%
footprint of our building this will not
 
04:33:24.230 --> 04:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:25.830 --> 04:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
it's important to recognize that when
 
04:33:28.709 --> 04:33:28.719 align:start position:0%
the building was first built
 
04:33:30.949 --> 04:33:30.959 align:start position:0%
we did not have the demand of services
 
04:33:33.029 --> 04:33:33.039 align:start position:0%
that we're seeing now
 
04:33:34.629 --> 04:33:34.639 align:start position:0%
those demands
 
04:33:37.349 --> 04:33:37.359 align:start position:0%
uh have come over time
 
04:33:39.910 --> 04:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
and you'll see in my remarks that uh the
 
04:33:41.830 --> 04:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
initial building was built
 
04:33:41.840 --> 04:33:42.830 align:start position:0%
initial building was built
in

04:33:42.830 --> 04:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:33:42.840 --> 04:33:44.551 align:start position:0%
in
1983

04:33:44.551 --> 04:33:44.561 align:start position:0%
1983
 
04:33:47.269 --> 04:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
and then an addition in 1986 and then in
 
04:33:50.230 --> 04:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
1992 the last edition
 
04:33:52.949 --> 04:33:52.959 align:start position:0%
i think at the time uh
 
04:33:55.510 --> 04:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
there was not any anticipation that uh
 
04:33:57.590 --> 04:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
the need for space classroom space was
 
04:33:59.830 --> 04:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
going to grow the way it did
 
04:34:02.551 --> 04:34:02.561 align:start position:0%
on top of that our agency has
 
04:34:05.750 --> 04:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
assumed a number of new duties
 
04:34:08.150 --> 04:34:08.160 align:start position:0%
over the last two years for a variety of
 
04:34:10.869 --> 04:34:10.879 align:start position:0%
reasons to include leak and some
 
04:34:13.510 --> 04:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
legislative initiatives to provide
 
04:34:15.590 --> 04:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
crisis intervention training to police
 
04:34:18.390 --> 04:34:18.400 align:start position:0%
officers across the state
 
04:34:20.949 --> 04:34:20.959 align:start position:0%
and to
 
04:34:23.429 --> 04:34:23.439 align:start position:0%
create a more robust
 
04:34:25.590 --> 04:34:25.600 align:start position:0%
misconduct review board
 
04:34:28.551 --> 04:34:28.561 align:start position:0%
for all of those reasons uh
 
04:34:31.510 --> 04:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
we feel that it's imperative that we we
 
04:34:33.670 --> 04:34:33.680 align:start position:0%
try to reclaim this space so that it's
 
04:34:33.680 --> 04:34:35.910 align:start position:0%
try to reclaim this space so that it's
usable

04:34:35.910 --> 04:34:35.920 align:start position:0%
usable
 
04:34:35.920 --> 04:34:38.150 align:start position:0%
usable
i

04:34:38.150 --> 04:34:38.160 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:34:40.869 --> 04:34:40.879 align:start position:0%
with that
 
04:34:42.789 --> 04:34:42.799 align:start position:0%
i would uh
 
04:34:44.709 --> 04:34:44.719 align:start position:0%
stand ready for any questions or
 
04:34:46.070 --> 04:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
concerns any
 
04:34:49.510 --> 04:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:51.750 --> 04:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
good afternoon again uh my question is
 
04:34:53.750 --> 04:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
the garage where the simulator is going
 
04:34:55.990 --> 04:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
what's that being used for now
 
04:34:58.230 --> 04:34:58.240 align:start position:0%
so that is one of two garages that we
 
04:35:00.709 --> 04:35:00.719 align:start position:0%
have out back and the maintenance
 
04:35:00.719 --> 04:35:01.910 align:start position:0%
have out back and the maintenance
department

04:35:01.910 --> 04:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
department
 
04:35:03.189 --> 04:35:03.199 align:start position:0%
has uh
 
04:35:05.910 --> 04:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
kind of turned that into a
 
04:35:08.869 --> 04:35:08.879 align:start position:0%
catch-all storage facility
 
04:35:11.750 --> 04:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
we feel very confident that we could
 
04:35:15.029 --> 04:35:15.039 align:start position:0%
either rent or buy a condex unit
 
04:35:17.429 --> 04:35:17.439 align:start position:0%
to to use just for the purposes of
 
04:35:17.439 --> 04:35:18.789 align:start position:0%
to to use just for the purposes of
storage

04:35:18.789 --> 04:35:18.799 align:start position:0%
storage
 
04:35:20.830 --> 04:35:20.840 align:start position:0%
we do not use that for
 
04:35:23.510 --> 04:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
vehicles it's really just it's turned
 
04:35:25.349 --> 04:35:25.359 align:start position:0%
into over time
 
04:35:27.510 --> 04:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
kind of the kitchen draw if you would
 
04:35:30.070 --> 04:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
for police standards and training so
 
04:35:32.470 --> 04:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
we feel very confident that those items
 
04:35:34.150 --> 04:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
that we have to retain
 
04:35:36.629 --> 04:35:36.639 align:start position:0%
uh would fit in a context without a
 
04:35:36.639 --> 04:35:37.990 align:start position:0%
uh would fit in a context without a
problem

04:35:37.990 --> 04:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
problem
 
04:35:41.990 --> 04:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:43.109 --> 04:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
appreciate it
 
04:35:45.750 --> 04:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
i have a question so you you operate
 
04:35:47.109 --> 04:35:47.119 align:start position:0%
essentially you do a full-time police
 
04:35:49.189 --> 04:35:49.199 align:start position:0%
academy a different a sort of different
 
04:35:51.109 --> 04:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
curriculum for part-time police officers
 
04:35:52.230 --> 04:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
and then the
 
04:35:53.990 --> 04:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
the was it new hampshire corrections
 
04:35:56.869 --> 04:35:56.879 align:start position:0%
academy these are all done on site
 
04:35:59.830 --> 04:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
uh that is correct commissioner and um
 
04:36:02.150 --> 04:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
it's a dumb question but how like how
 
04:36:05.189 --> 04:36:05.199 align:start position:0%
much of your operation is each of those
 
04:36:06.869 --> 04:36:06.879 align:start position:0%
is it mostly the
 
04:36:08.470 --> 04:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
full-time police officers and the other
 
04:36:11.750 --> 04:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
two are sort of addendums or
 
04:36:14.629 --> 04:36:14.639 align:start position:0%
so we we serve as the sole source for
 
04:36:17.189 --> 04:36:17.199 align:start position:0%
recruit training for every single law
 
04:36:18.869 --> 04:36:18.879 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer in the state of new
 
04:36:18.879 --> 04:36:20.310 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer in the state of new
hampshire

04:36:20.310 --> 04:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
04:36:23.590 --> 04:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
we are one of the few states that enjoy
 
04:36:26.070 --> 04:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
the single academy
 
04:36:27.750 --> 04:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
there are many states in our country
 
04:36:27.760 --> 04:36:28.629 align:start position:0%
there are many states in our country
that

04:36:28.629 --> 04:36:28.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:36:32.070 --> 04:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
have academies across their state and i
 
04:36:33.670 --> 04:36:33.680 align:start position:0%
can tell you
 
04:36:35.109 --> 04:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
that it
 
04:36:39.109 --> 04:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
causes a lot of problems quite frankly
 
04:36:41.349 --> 04:36:41.359 align:start position:0%
on top of that we are the primary source
 
04:36:43.349 --> 04:36:43.359 align:start position:0%
for in-service training for all law
 
04:36:45.910 --> 04:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers to include
 
04:36:47.510 --> 04:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
all the the state level corrections
 
04:36:53.109 --> 04:36:53.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:56.310 --> 04:36:56.320 align:start position:0%
on top of that we also run a probation
 
04:36:56.320 --> 04:36:57.269 align:start position:0%
on top of that we also run a probation
parole

04:36:57.269 --> 04:36:57.279 align:start position:0%
parole
 
04:37:00.470 --> 04:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
kind of additive to those academies and
 
04:37:03.590 --> 04:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
we also provide the part-time police
 
04:37:03.600 --> 04:37:06.390 align:start position:0%
we also provide the part-time police
academy

04:37:06.390 --> 04:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:09.029 --> 04:37:09.039 align:start position:0%
over the last probably six months we
 
04:37:12.150 --> 04:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
have seen a significant demand for
 
04:37:15.990 --> 04:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
academy training because our
 
04:37:19.830 --> 04:37:19.840 align:start position:0%
our profession right now is seeing a
 
04:37:22.551 --> 04:37:22.561 align:start position:0%
a just a brutal recruitment and
 
04:37:24.390 --> 04:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
retention environment
 
04:37:26.949 --> 04:37:26.959 align:start position:0%
and uh police officers are leaving in
 
04:37:29.750 --> 04:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
droves here in new hampshire
 
04:37:32.869 --> 04:37:32.879 align:start position:0%
and across the country quite frankly
 
04:37:35.029 --> 04:37:35.039 align:start position:0%
we are in order to keep up with the
 
04:37:36.869 --> 04:37:36.879 align:start position:0%
demand because we don't have enough
 
04:37:39.750 --> 04:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
classroom space
 
04:37:43.029 --> 04:37:43.039 align:start position:0%
we are working where we have overlapping
 
04:37:45.429 --> 04:37:45.439 align:start position:0%
police academies
 
04:37:47.349 --> 04:37:47.359 align:start position:0%
while we're running
 
04:37:49.189 --> 04:37:49.199 align:start position:0%
the corrections academy and the
 
04:37:51.269 --> 04:37:51.279 align:start position:0%
part-time academy
 
04:37:53.349 --> 04:37:53.359 align:start position:0%
my staff is very unhappy with me right
 
04:37:53.359 --> 04:37:54.310 align:start position:0%
my staff is very unhappy with me right
now

04:37:54.310 --> 04:37:54.320 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:37:55.990 --> 04:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
but that's the demand and we're gonna
 
04:37:57.590 --> 04:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
meet that demand
 
04:38:00.230 --> 04:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
if we had more space
 
04:38:02.470 --> 04:38:02.480 align:start position:0%
we would be able to
 
04:38:02.480 --> 04:38:03.670 align:start position:0%
we would be able to
reduce

04:38:03.670 --> 04:38:03.680 align:start position:0%
reduce
 
04:38:05.750 --> 04:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
the size of classes which would reduce
 
04:38:09.910 --> 04:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
the the number of instructors per class
 
04:38:13.029 --> 04:38:13.039 align:start position:0%
and we could move at a pace
 
04:38:14.789 --> 04:38:14.799 align:start position:0%
that would allow us to keep up with the
 
04:38:16.230 --> 04:38:16.240 align:start position:0%
attrition rate
 
04:38:17.750 --> 04:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
that a lot of these communities are
 
04:38:19.510 --> 04:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
feeling i cannot tell you how many times
 
04:38:21.750 --> 04:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
i get a call from a chief
 
04:38:23.429 --> 04:38:23.439 align:start position:0%
saying i got to get my guy in i gotta
 
04:38:26.709 --> 04:38:26.719 align:start position:0%
get my guy in and we we've maxed out on
 
04:38:28.070 --> 04:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
the seats we just don't have enough
 
04:38:30.869 --> 04:38:30.879 align:start position:0%
seats and so we have to kick that that
 
04:38:33.510 --> 04:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
recruit down the road to the next
 
04:38:35.510 --> 04:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
available class
 
04:38:39.590 --> 04:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
so to to speak to uh our priorities
 
04:38:41.990 --> 04:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner that the first priority is
 
04:38:43.590 --> 04:38:43.600 align:start position:0%
recruit training
 
04:38:45.990 --> 04:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
and uh we devote
 
04:38:46.000 --> 04:38:47.990 align:start position:0%
and uh we devote
probably

04:38:47.990 --> 04:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
probably
 
04:38:50.470 --> 04:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
i would say around 80 percent of our
 
04:38:53.910 --> 04:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
resources to deliver that program
 
04:38:56.470 --> 04:38:56.480 align:start position:0%
and then another 15
 
04:39:00.390 --> 04:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
to 18 percent on the in service program
 
04:39:02.230 --> 04:39:02.240 align:start position:0%
although that is going to increase
 
04:39:05.029 --> 04:39:05.039 align:start position:0%
because because of leak
 
04:39:07.429 --> 04:39:07.439 align:start position:0%
new hampshire police officers
 
04:39:09.429 --> 04:39:09.439 align:start position:0%
instead of having eight hours of
 
04:39:11.830 --> 04:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
in-service training mandated
 
04:39:14.949 --> 04:39:14.959 align:start position:0%
is rising up to 24 hours
 
04:39:18.390 --> 04:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
annually of in-service training
 
04:39:21.830 --> 04:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
for that reason we we need to expand our
 
04:39:24.070 --> 04:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
in-service training program as well to
 
04:39:25.830 --> 04:39:25.840 align:start position:0%
meet the needs of all the law
 
04:39:28.390 --> 04:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers that we have
 
04:39:31.429 --> 04:39:31.439 align:start position:0%
uh and then finally the uh the part-time
 
04:39:31.439 --> 04:39:32.629 align:start position:0%
uh and then finally the uh the part-time
academy

04:39:32.629 --> 04:39:32.639 align:start position:0%
academy
 
04:39:35.349 --> 04:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
uh really for a variety of reasons we're
 
04:39:38.788 --> 04:39:38.798 align:start position:0%
seeing that to be the least of of our
 
04:39:41.350 --> 04:39:41.360 align:start position:0%
uh resource allocation
 
04:39:43.830 --> 04:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
to to follow up on that you're you're in
 
04:39:45.830 --> 04:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
a situation right now where demand
 
04:39:48.230 --> 04:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
significantly exceeds capacity and
 
04:39:49.830 --> 04:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
you're i mean i don't mean it quite that
 
04:39:51.190 --> 04:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
way but you are having to occasionally
 
04:39:52.788 --> 04:39:52.798 align:start position:0%
turn people away and and come back to
 
04:39:54.390 --> 04:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
the next meeting or
 
04:39:56.310 --> 04:39:56.320 align:start position:0%
if you were
 
04:40:01.110 --> 04:40:01.120 align:start position:0%
it is this is the uh uh biggest obstacle
 
04:40:04.230 --> 04:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
to meeting that demand at the time of
 
04:40:04.240 --> 04:40:05.830 align:start position:0%
to meeting that demand at the time of
demand

04:40:05.830 --> 04:40:05.840 align:start position:0%
demand
 
04:40:07.910 --> 04:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh classroom space
 
04:40:09.510 --> 04:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
if it is
 
04:40:11.750 --> 04:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
is additional classroom space
 
04:40:13.910 --> 04:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
um and and i'm presuming beyond your
 
04:40:16.708 --> 04:40:16.718 align:start position:0%
capital budget request even
 
04:40:18.550 --> 04:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
does it need to be on site i mean i
 
04:40:20.390 --> 04:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
presume it needs to be on site but i
 
04:40:22.948 --> 04:40:22.958 align:start position:0%
figured i would ask that
 
04:40:27.510 --> 04:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:30.070 --> 04:40:30.080 align:start position:0%
for a variety of reasons we many of
 
04:40:32.628 --> 04:40:32.638 align:start position:0%
these classes require equipment as part
 
04:40:34.708 --> 04:40:34.718 align:start position:0%
of the training
 
04:40:37.830 --> 04:40:37.840 align:start position:0%
all of our staff are located on site
 
04:40:41.030 --> 04:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
and their ability to access it equipment
 
04:40:43.190 --> 04:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
and things of that nature training
 
04:40:45.350 --> 04:40:45.360 align:start position:0%
equipment uh
 
04:40:47.990 --> 04:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
again uh we we're trying to be
 
04:40:50.628 --> 04:40:50.638 align:start position:0%
self-sufficient and we did think you
 
04:40:52.868 --> 04:40:52.878 align:start position:0%
know short term can we address this
 
04:40:55.350 --> 04:40:55.360 align:start position:0%
problem and in fact we are using
 
04:40:57.350 --> 04:40:57.360 align:start position:0%
uh the national guard
 
04:40:59.590 --> 04:40:59.600 align:start position:0%
armory in uh
 
04:41:03.510 --> 04:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
is it penacook or pembroke pembroke
 
04:41:05.990 --> 04:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
to deliver cit training because we just
 
04:41:08.310 --> 04:41:08.320 align:start position:0%
we we just don't have the space
 
04:41:11.350 --> 04:41:11.360 align:start position:0%
and those cit classes are rolling
 
04:41:13.190 --> 04:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
04:41:15.510 --> 04:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
we can handle it in a
 
04:41:18.230 --> 04:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
kind of a uh
 
04:41:19.830 --> 04:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
you know if this was
 
04:41:21.190 --> 04:41:21.200 align:start position:0%
a peak
 
04:41:23.590 --> 04:41:23.600 align:start position:0%
in our activity we certainly could work
 
04:41:25.590 --> 04:41:25.600 align:start position:0%
around that you know we have nhti across
 
04:41:27.030 --> 04:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
the street we could enter into some
 
04:41:28.550 --> 04:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
agreements with them
 
04:41:30.070 --> 04:41:30.080 align:start position:0%
to rent space
 
04:41:31.270 --> 04:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
although we don't have any money in our
 
04:41:33.030 --> 04:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
budget to do that now
 
04:41:35.990 --> 04:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh but we we certainly could try to
 
04:41:39.350 --> 04:41:39.360 align:start position:0%
figure something out for the short term
 
04:41:42.788 --> 04:41:42.798 align:start position:0%
uh i i truly believe that this is not a
 
04:41:45.190 --> 04:41:45.200 align:start position:0%
short term problem that we're looking at
 
04:41:46.470 --> 04:41:46.480 align:start position:0%
and in fact
 
04:41:46.480 --> 04:41:47.350 align:start position:0%
and in fact
uh

04:41:47.350 --> 04:41:47.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:41:49.590 --> 04:41:49.600 align:start position:0%
is a problem that's going to be with us
 
04:41:51.510 --> 04:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
for and not a problem but a challenge
 
04:41:53.670 --> 04:41:53.680 align:start position:0%
that's in front of us and will be for
 
04:41:55.750 --> 04:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
for a period of time
 
04:41:59.270 --> 04:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
so that begs the question then that um
 
04:42:00.868 --> 04:42:00.878 align:start position:0%
you're reclaiming class from three and
 
04:42:00.878 --> 04:42:01.830 align:start position:0%
you're reclaiming class from three and
four

04:42:01.830 --> 04:42:01.840 align:start position:0%
four
 
04:42:03.990 --> 04:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
and i think project two is a
 
04:42:07.270 --> 04:42:07.280 align:start position:0%
a fifth classroom functionally
 
04:42:08.788 --> 04:42:08.798 align:start position:0%
uh to what extent does that meet the
 
04:42:11.590 --> 04:42:11.600 align:start position:0%
demand or is that only part way there
 
04:42:13.590 --> 04:42:13.600 align:start position:0%
i i think that gets us
 
04:42:13.600 --> 04:42:14.390 align:start position:0%
i i think that gets us
uh

04:42:14.390 --> 04:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:42:15.830 --> 04:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
a good
 
04:42:19.270 --> 04:42:19.280 align:start position:0%
a good way past part-time so it'll
 
04:42:21.750 --> 04:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
it'll it'll buy us uh a couple of years
 
04:42:24.788 --> 04:42:24.798 align:start position:0%
i think if it weren't an issue if
 
04:42:26.150 --> 04:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
i'm going to say words you're not
 
04:42:27.670 --> 04:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
supposed to say in the legislature if
 
04:42:29.590 --> 04:42:29.600 align:start position:0%
money weren't an issue
 
04:42:29.600 --> 04:42:31.350 align:start position:0%
money weren't an issue
um

04:42:31.350 --> 04:42:31.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:33.590 --> 04:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
is it a sixth classroom or a seventh
 
04:42:35.910 --> 04:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
classroom where would you need to be if
 
04:42:37.750 --> 04:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
i if i said you you know i think we can
 
04:42:39.590 --> 04:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
work something out would it be an
 
04:42:42.708 --> 04:42:42.718 align:start position:0%
additional one beyond these three
 
04:42:44.550 --> 04:42:44.560 align:start position:0%
uh commissioner if i understand the
 
04:42:46.628 --> 04:42:46.638 align:start position:0%
question and money is not a it's very
 
04:42:49.590 --> 04:42:49.600 align:start position:0%
hypothetical very hypothetically
 
04:42:53.990 --> 04:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
i would i would uh propose in addition
 
04:42:56.868 --> 04:42:56.878 align:start position:0%
to our tactical center to create
 
04:42:59.030 --> 04:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
two very large
 
04:43:00.948 --> 04:43:00.958 align:start position:0%
uh 150 seat
 
04:43:00.958 --> 04:43:02.868 align:start position:0%
uh 150 seat
uh

04:43:02.868 --> 04:43:02.878 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:43:05.110 --> 04:43:05.120 align:start position:0%
lecture halls that could actually be
 
04:43:07.670 --> 04:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
opened up into one big lecture hall
 
04:43:09.990 --> 04:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh and a number of office spaces because
 
04:43:11.990 --> 04:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
i think that gets us
 
04:43:13.990 --> 04:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
that covers the academy training right
 
04:43:16.390 --> 04:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
there we could have very very large
 
04:43:18.788 --> 04:43:18.798 align:start position:0%
academy classes to keep up with
 
04:43:20.470 --> 04:43:20.480 align:start position:0%
the demand
 
04:43:22.390 --> 04:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
and then we would have
 
04:43:24.868 --> 04:43:24.878 align:start position:0%
in essence we would reclaim two lecture
 
04:43:27.110 --> 04:43:27.120 align:start position:0%
halls from the existing building that we
 
04:43:29.190 --> 04:43:29.200 align:start position:0%
could then use for in-service
 
04:43:31.670 --> 04:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
but that
 
04:43:31.680 --> 04:43:32.948 align:start position:0%
but that
is

04:43:32.948 --> 04:43:32.958 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:43:35.750 --> 04:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
with uh would cost more money uh yes sir
 
04:43:37.670 --> 04:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
so one last hypothetical and then i'll
 
04:43:39.030 --> 04:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
shut up um
 
04:43:41.670 --> 04:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
not hypothetical but the excess demand
 
04:43:42.948 --> 04:43:42.958 align:start position:0%
or the the
 
04:43:44.470 --> 04:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
increased demand for lack of a better
 
04:43:47.270 --> 04:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
word um across the board or is it mostly
 
04:43:49.190 --> 04:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
among full-time officers like are you
 
04:43:49.200 --> 04:43:50.150 align:start position:0%
among full-time officers like are you
seeing

04:43:50.150 --> 04:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
seeing
 
04:43:52.150 --> 04:43:52.160 align:start position:0%
significant excess demand with
 
04:43:54.470 --> 04:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
correctional academy and part-time too
 
04:43:56.070 --> 04:43:56.080 align:start position:0%
or is it
 
04:43:56.080 --> 04:43:57.590 align:start position:0%
or is it
so

04:43:57.590 --> 04:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:43:58.708 --> 04:43:58.718 align:start position:0%
i think that's a great question
 
04:44:00.948 --> 04:44:00.958 align:start position:0%
commissioner right now we are seeing a
 
04:44:03.510 --> 04:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
significant demand for full-time police
 
04:44:05.430 --> 04:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
officer training
 
04:44:09.110 --> 04:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
every single community in our state
 
04:44:11.910 --> 04:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
through attrition and just difficulty
 
04:44:13.910 --> 04:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
and recruitment
 
04:44:15.750 --> 04:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
they're just seeing
 
04:44:20.070 --> 04:44:20.080 align:start position:0%
a vast number of vacancies
 
04:44:22.948 --> 04:44:22.958 align:start position:0%
we have to stay on top of that demand we
 
04:44:25.510 --> 04:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
cannot be the choke point
 
04:44:26.948 --> 04:44:26.958 align:start position:0%
because these communities and these
 
04:44:29.110 --> 04:44:29.120 align:start position:0%
agencies are are hiring these good
 
04:44:31.110 --> 04:44:31.120 align:start position:0%
people we got to get them trained we got
 
04:44:33.030 --> 04:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
to get them back to the towns and cities
 
04:44:36.470 --> 04:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:37.590 --> 04:44:37.600 align:start position:0%
we are
 
04:44:40.070 --> 04:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
we are ready and willing and able to
 
04:44:41.270 --> 04:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
take care of the department of
 
04:44:41.280 --> 04:44:43.190 align:start position:0%
take care of the department of
corrections

04:44:43.190 --> 04:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
corrections
 
04:44:45.910 --> 04:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
their classes have traditionally been
 
04:44:47.990 --> 04:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
very very low
 
04:44:50.310 --> 04:44:50.320 align:start position:0%
again because of the difficulty in
 
04:44:50.320 --> 04:44:53.110 align:start position:0%
again because of the difficulty in
recruitment

04:44:53.110 --> 04:44:53.120 align:start position:0%
recruitment
 
04:44:55.190 --> 04:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
i think this class we have right now we
 
04:44:58.708 --> 04:44:58.718 align:start position:0%
have 15 uniformed officers and that
 
04:45:01.110 --> 04:45:01.120 align:start position:0%
the one before that was eight and the
 
04:45:03.910 --> 04:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
one before that i think was 12
 
04:45:07.590 --> 04:45:07.600 align:start position:0%
i think so it's very very difficult to
 
04:45:07.600 --> 04:45:09.430 align:start position:0%
i think so it's very very difficult to
recruit

04:45:09.430 --> 04:45:09.440 align:start position:0%
recruit
 
04:45:13.030 --> 04:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:15.830 --> 04:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
the the police department the police
 
04:45:15.840 --> 04:45:17.190 align:start position:0%
the the police department the police
departments

04:45:17.190 --> 04:45:17.200 align:start position:0%
departments
 
04:45:20.708 --> 04:45:20.718 align:start position:0%
are finding candidates very quickly
 
04:45:22.550 --> 04:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
uh they're hiring them and they're
 
04:45:24.230 --> 04:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
trying to turn them around as fast as
 
04:45:25.830 --> 04:45:25.840 align:start position:0%
they can so
 
04:45:25.840 --> 04:45:26.708 align:start position:0%
they can so
uh

04:45:26.708 --> 04:45:26.718 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:45:28.550 --> 04:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
again trying to meet all those needs
 
04:45:30.708 --> 04:45:30.718 align:start position:0%
it's a great challenge we we love it
 
04:45:32.948 --> 04:45:32.958 align:start position:0%
this is our business uh we just want to
 
04:45:35.430 --> 04:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
be able to do it so that we're not uh
 
04:45:37.270 --> 04:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
the choke point
 
04:45:38.788 --> 04:45:38.798 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks for indulging me thank
 
04:45:39.990 --> 04:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
you sir
 
04:45:40.000 --> 04:45:41.910 align:start position:0%
you sir
representative

04:45:41.910 --> 04:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:45:44.230 --> 04:45:44.240 align:start position:0%
um thank you um
 
04:45:46.788 --> 04:45:46.798 align:start position:0%
you're talking about a today problem of
 
04:45:49.430 --> 04:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
classroom and all the rest
 
04:45:51.270 --> 04:45:51.280 align:start position:0%
assuming that these were approved in the
 
04:45:53.270 --> 04:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
next capital budget we're talking two to
 
04:45:55.350 --> 04:45:55.360 align:start position:0%
three years from now before you see
 
04:45:55.360 --> 04:45:56.788 align:start position:0%
three years from now before you see
classrooms

04:45:56.788 --> 04:45:56.798 align:start position:0%
classrooms
 
04:45:56.798 --> 04:45:58.628 align:start position:0%
classrooms
um

04:45:58.628 --> 04:45:58.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:46:00.550 --> 04:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
what are your plans are you just going
 
04:46:02.550 --> 04:46:02.560 align:start position:0%
to keep muddling along
 
04:46:05.110 --> 04:46:05.120 align:start position:0%
uh over the next two to three years and
 
04:46:09.430 --> 04:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
hope that it all evens out at the end of
 
04:46:11.190 --> 04:46:11.200 align:start position:0%
the next biennium
 
04:46:14.150 --> 04:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
or or what because it gets to the heart
 
04:46:17.590 --> 04:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
of the matter of what what do we fund
 
04:46:19.430 --> 04:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
what do we build
 
04:46:22.230 --> 04:46:22.240 align:start position:0%
and how soon do we get it done it really
 
04:46:22.240 --> 04:46:24.070 align:start position:0%
and how soon do we get it done it really
does

04:46:24.070 --> 04:46:24.080 align:start position:0%
does
 
04:46:25.270 --> 04:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
i appreciate that question
 
04:46:25.280 --> 04:46:26.470 align:start position:0%
i appreciate that question
representative

04:46:26.470 --> 04:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:46:29.030 --> 04:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh i think it's a today problem that's
 
04:46:30.708 --> 04:46:30.718 align:start position:0%
not going away
 
04:46:32.708 --> 04:46:32.718 align:start position:0%
that's how i see this
 
04:46:33.750 --> 04:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
i've been in new hampshire law
 
04:46:36.390 --> 04:46:36.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement for just shy of 40 years
 
04:46:38.310 --> 04:46:38.320 align:start position:0%
and i can tell you that i have never
 
04:46:38.320 --> 04:46:39.590 align:start position:0%
and i can tell you that i have never
seen

04:46:39.590 --> 04:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
seen
 
04:46:42.070 --> 04:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
the vacancy rate that we are seeing
 
04:46:43.190 --> 04:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
right now
 
04:46:44.708 --> 04:46:44.718 align:start position:0%
and and
 
04:46:47.270 --> 04:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
to that end i don't know that that's
 
04:46:48.948 --> 04:46:48.958 align:start position:0%
going to get corrected any time soon
 
04:46:50.788 --> 04:46:50.798 align:start position:0%
quite frankly and i think the
 
04:46:52.948 --> 04:46:52.958 align:start position:0%
this uh the new workforce the younger
 
04:46:54.390 --> 04:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
folks that we have coming into our
 
04:46:54.400 --> 04:46:55.510 align:start position:0%
folks that we have coming into our
profession

04:46:55.510 --> 04:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
profession
 
04:46:58.230 --> 04:46:58.240 align:start position:0%
are not seeing it the same way
 
04:47:00.070 --> 04:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
people like me saw it you know you get
 
04:47:02.070 --> 04:47:02.080 align:start position:0%
in and you you do your time you click
 
04:47:03.910 --> 04:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
away i think a lot of these younger
 
04:47:05.350 --> 04:47:05.360 align:start position:0%
people they do it
 
04:47:07.110 --> 04:47:07.120 align:start position:0%
they do it for five years ten years and
 
04:47:08.948 --> 04:47:08.958 align:start position:0%
then they're moving down the road to
 
04:47:10.310 --> 04:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
something bigger and better and more
 
04:47:10.320 --> 04:47:11.430 align:start position:0%
something bigger and better and more
exciting

04:47:11.430 --> 04:47:11.440 align:start position:0%
exciting
 
04:47:13.110 --> 04:47:13.120 align:start position:0%
although i can't imagine what else is
 
04:47:15.990 --> 04:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
more exciting than this right
 
04:47:19.110 --> 04:47:19.120 align:start position:0%
so i i i agree with you this is a today
 
04:47:19.120 --> 04:47:19.990 align:start position:0%
so i i i agree with you this is a today
problem

04:47:19.990 --> 04:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
problem
 
04:47:21.990 --> 04:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
uh but i really
 
04:47:23.270 --> 04:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
i think it's very important to
 
04:47:25.190 --> 04:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
understand that this is a today problem
 
04:47:26.708 --> 04:47:26.718 align:start position:0%
that is going to continue into the
 
04:47:28.470 --> 04:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
future and in the meantime
 
04:47:29.830 --> 04:47:29.840 align:start position:0%
representative and i think it's a great
 
04:47:29.840 --> 04:47:30.868 align:start position:0%
representative and i think it's a great
question

04:47:30.868 --> 04:47:30.878 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:47:33.750 --> 04:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
the major and i are literally
 
04:47:35.910 --> 04:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
pulling what hair we have left out of
 
04:47:37.110 --> 04:47:37.120 align:start position:0%
our heads
 
04:47:40.150 --> 04:47:40.160 align:start position:0%
to try to meet the short-term demands
 
04:47:42.230 --> 04:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
and again the national guard's been very
 
04:47:45.190 --> 04:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
helpful to us providing us some learning
 
04:47:45.200 --> 04:47:46.310 align:start position:0%
helpful to us providing us some learning
space

04:47:46.310 --> 04:47:46.320 align:start position:0%
space
 
04:47:47.510 --> 04:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
depending on
 
04:47:49.350 --> 04:47:49.360 align:start position:0%
some certain legislation that may go
 
04:47:49.360 --> 04:47:50.150 align:start position:0%
some certain legislation that may go
through

04:47:50.150 --> 04:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
through
 
04:47:53.110 --> 04:47:53.120 align:start position:0%
that may free up some money for us to
 
04:47:56.788 --> 04:47:56.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:59.430 --> 04:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
we still need to sit down with nhti and
 
04:48:01.670 --> 04:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
see if there's any opportunities that we
 
04:48:04.070 --> 04:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
can leverage over there to help us meet
 
04:48:05.910 --> 04:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
the immediate demand that we're looking
 
04:48:07.190 --> 04:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
at right now
 
04:48:09.110 --> 04:48:09.120 align:start position:0%
uh and again
 
04:48:11.030 --> 04:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to address even that
 
04:48:12.390 --> 04:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
immediate demand
 
04:48:13.830 --> 04:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to try to address
 
04:48:15.990 --> 04:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
that in the next fiscal year because we
 
04:48:18.470 --> 04:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
just we didn't plan for it in this
 
04:48:18.480 --> 04:48:22.708 align:start position:0%
just we didn't plan for it in this
biennium

04:48:22.708 --> 04:48:22.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:22.718 --> 04:48:23.750 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:48:23.750 --> 04:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:48:25.350 --> 04:48:25.360 align:start position:0%
so just to follow up on the
 
04:48:27.590 --> 04:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
commissioners and representatives
 
04:48:27.600 --> 04:48:28.868 align:start position:0%
commissioners and representatives
question

04:48:28.868 --> 04:48:28.878 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:48:30.550 --> 04:48:30.560 align:start position:0%
has there been any
 
04:48:33.750 --> 04:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
space needs studies done to determine
 
04:48:35.670 --> 04:48:35.680 align:start position:0%
how many you know how many square feet
 
04:48:37.830 --> 04:48:37.840 align:start position:0%
you might need of classroom space to
 
04:48:40.070 --> 04:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
solve your problem
 
04:48:41.750 --> 04:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh there is not that's an excellent
 
04:48:43.910 --> 04:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
question uh again
 
04:48:43.920 --> 04:48:45.430 align:start position:0%
question uh again
uh

04:48:45.430 --> 04:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:48:49.030 --> 04:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:51.510 --> 04:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
we are looking at this and the reason we
 
04:48:53.590 --> 04:48:53.600 align:start position:0%
came to this these decisions to bring
 
04:48:56.230 --> 04:48:56.240 align:start position:0%
these uh projects forward
 
04:49:00.788 --> 04:49:00.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:02.948 --> 04:49:02.958 align:start position:0%
i guess like a farmer's
 
04:49:04.948 --> 04:49:04.958 align:start position:0%
approach of just looking at you know
 
04:49:07.190 --> 04:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
what we have on deck for people trying
 
04:49:09.430 --> 04:49:09.440 align:start position:0%
to get into these classes
 
04:49:12.390 --> 04:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
and and the fact that uh that rate has
 
04:49:15.510 --> 04:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
not dropped and in fact has increased
 
04:49:17.750 --> 04:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
also understanding that in the course of
 
04:49:19.590 --> 04:49:19.600 align:start position:0%
the next three years
 
04:49:22.788 --> 04:49:22.798 align:start position:0%
we're going to need to triple our uh
 
04:49:22.798 --> 04:49:24.070 align:start position:0%
we're going to need to triple our uh
in-service

04:49:24.070 --> 04:49:24.080 align:start position:0%
in-service
 
04:49:27.430 --> 04:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
offerings uh because of uh
 
04:49:29.190 --> 04:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
changes from leak
 
04:49:33.510 --> 04:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
so we haven't done a a a study per se
 
04:49:35.830 --> 04:49:35.840 align:start position:0%
we have based these projections really
 
04:49:37.910 --> 04:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
on what we're seeing now and what we
 
04:49:39.430 --> 04:49:39.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely know is coming into the
 
04:49:41.430 --> 04:49:41.440 align:start position:0%
future which is that that increase in
 
04:49:43.350 --> 04:49:43.360 align:start position:0%
in-service cl
 
04:49:45.190 --> 04:49:45.200 align:start position:0%
classes and hours
 
04:49:48.830 --> 04:49:48.840 align:start position:0%
thank you follow up on that yes please
 
04:49:52.550 --> 04:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
um the device that you're planning to
 
04:49:55.350 --> 04:49:55.360 align:start position:0%
move to the garage
 
04:49:58.470 --> 04:49:58.480 align:start position:0%
would moving it to the garage
 
04:50:01.750 --> 04:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
allow you full use of the device in your
 
04:50:03.990 --> 04:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
training protocols
 
04:50:05.430 --> 04:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
all right that's a great question and
 
04:50:08.070 --> 04:50:08.080 align:start position:0%
yes the so the the virtual as i said
 
04:50:10.070 --> 04:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
earlier is a very very expensive piece
 
04:50:13.590 --> 04:50:13.600 align:start position:0%
of equipment in fact part of the
 
04:50:15.670 --> 04:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
request here is to actually pay the
 
04:50:18.070 --> 04:50:18.080 align:start position:0%
company to come and do the moving
 
04:50:21.510 --> 04:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
because it is is so um
 
04:50:23.590 --> 04:50:23.600 align:start position:0%
it's it's both delicate and it has to be
 
04:50:25.670 --> 04:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
set up exactly the way it's supposed to
 
04:50:28.550 --> 04:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
be set up so that it works properly
 
04:50:31.510 --> 04:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
but that would indeed give us those two
 
04:50:32.948 --> 04:50:32.958 align:start position:0%
classrooms back
 
04:50:35.670 --> 04:50:35.680 align:start position:0%
uh which would still be able to use the
 
04:50:38.628 --> 04:50:38.638 align:start position:0%
device located in the garage
 
04:50:41.910 --> 04:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
we absolutely could we the uh again part
 
04:50:43.590 --> 04:50:43.600 align:start position:0%
of the project is to refurbish the
 
04:50:46.070 --> 04:50:46.080 align:start position:0%
garage so that it is it's not a garage
 
04:50:49.190 --> 04:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
anymore but a training facility and uh
 
04:50:51.590 --> 04:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
the other plus to it while it's not a
 
04:50:52.948 --> 04:50:52.958 align:start position:0%
real problem
 
04:50:55.670 --> 04:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
uh as you can imagine the virtua
 
04:50:58.948 --> 04:50:58.958 align:start position:0%
simulates some very chaotic situations
 
04:51:01.110 --> 04:51:01.120 align:start position:0%
and those chaotic situations are very
 
04:51:01.120 --> 04:51:02.230 align:start position:0%
and those chaotic situations are very
loud

04:51:02.230 --> 04:51:02.240 align:start position:0%
loud
 
04:51:05.190 --> 04:51:05.200 align:start position:0%
and that virtua is right next to our
 
04:51:07.990 --> 04:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
lecture hall so if we have an in-service
 
04:51:09.670 --> 04:51:09.680 align:start position:0%
class going on
 
04:51:11.190 --> 04:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
in the virtua
 
04:51:13.030 --> 04:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
and they're responding to an active
 
04:51:13.040 --> 04:51:14.788 align:start position:0%
and they're responding to an active
shooter

04:51:14.788 --> 04:51:14.798 align:start position:0%
shooter
 
04:51:16.150 --> 04:51:16.160 align:start position:0%
at the same time that we're doing
 
04:51:18.310 --> 04:51:18.320 align:start position:0%
constitutional law in the lecture hall
 
04:51:19.830 --> 04:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
for the recruits
 
04:51:22.310 --> 04:51:22.320 align:start position:0%
the recruits get a little bit of both uh
 
04:51:24.788 --> 04:51:24.798 align:start position:0%
because of the the yelling and screaming
 
04:51:24.798 --> 04:51:25.590 align:start position:0%
because of the the yelling and screaming
and

04:51:25.590 --> 04:51:25.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:51:27.350 --> 04:51:27.360 align:start position:0%
the rounds that you can hear going off
 
04:51:29.030 --> 04:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
we tried to soundproof it as best as
 
04:51:30.628 --> 04:51:30.638 align:start position:0%
possible but
 
04:51:32.550 --> 04:51:32.560 align:start position:0%
still a lot of chaos so moving it out to
 
04:51:34.310 --> 04:51:34.320 align:start position:0%
the garage would certainly eliminate
 
04:51:36.948 --> 04:51:36.958 align:start position:0%
that problem as well a rock concert next
 
04:51:40.150 --> 04:51:40.160 align:start position:0%
to a court facility right you couldn't
 
04:51:43.510 --> 04:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
say it any better than that sir
 
04:51:43.520 --> 04:51:45.190 align:start position:0%
say it any better than that sir
representative

04:51:45.190 --> 04:51:45.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:51:47.350 --> 04:51:47.360 align:start position:0%
thank you director uh the question i
 
04:51:49.910 --> 04:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
have is you have such a workload
 
04:51:52.550 --> 04:51:52.560 align:start position:0%
and i'm a representative from hampton
 
04:51:54.310 --> 04:51:54.320 align:start position:0%
and the question has to do with
 
04:51:55.990 --> 04:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
part-time training do you actually have
 
04:51:57.750 --> 04:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
any classes now or have you had any
 
04:51:57.760 --> 04:51:58.788 align:start position:0%
any classes now or have you had any
recently

04:51:58.788 --> 04:51:58.798 align:start position:0%
recently
 
04:52:00.948 --> 04:52:00.958 align:start position:0%
so uh chief hobbs a very good friend of
 
04:52:00.958 --> 04:52:01.750 align:start position:0%
so uh chief hobbs a very good friend of
mine

04:52:01.750 --> 04:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
mine
 
04:52:03.590 --> 04:52:03.600 align:start position:0%
a very good friend of mine i came up in
 
04:52:05.190 --> 04:52:05.200 align:start position:0%
the seacoast too
 
04:52:07.350 --> 04:52:07.360 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:52:09.270 --> 04:52:09.280 align:start position:0%
he has been part of a
 
04:52:10.788 --> 04:52:10.798 align:start position:0%
working group
 
04:52:13.510 --> 04:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
where we're trying to
 
04:52:16.788 --> 04:52:16.798 align:start position:0%
land on how we move forward on the
 
04:52:18.708 --> 04:52:18.718 align:start position:0%
part-time program
 
04:52:18.718 --> 04:52:19.670 align:start position:0%
part-time program
and

04:52:19.670 --> 04:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:52:21.670 --> 04:52:21.680 align:start position:0%
this was one of the directives given to
 
04:52:24.628 --> 04:52:24.638 align:start position:0%
me by the governor under uh executive
 
04:52:27.590 --> 04:52:27.600 align:start position:0%
order 2020-19 which was to look at the
 
04:52:29.590 --> 04:52:29.600 align:start position:0%
part-time program and re-evaluate it
 
04:52:31.190 --> 04:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
quite frankly
 
04:52:31.200 --> 04:52:31.990 align:start position:0%
quite frankly
i

04:52:31.990 --> 04:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:52:33.670 --> 04:52:33.680 align:start position:0%
the short answer is yes we're getting
 
04:52:35.510 --> 04:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
ready to start a part-time class i
 
04:52:39.750 --> 04:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
reached out to dave and let him know
 
04:52:41.910 --> 04:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
i think that i'm going to propose some
 
04:52:44.310 --> 04:52:44.320 align:start position:0%
changes to my counsel and to the
 
04:52:44.320 --> 04:52:45.830 align:start position:0%
changes to my counsel and to the
governor

04:52:45.830 --> 04:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
governor
 
04:52:47.670 --> 04:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
really part-time officers are supposed
 
04:52:50.470 --> 04:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
to be used the way hampton uses them
 
04:52:52.628 --> 04:52:52.638 align:start position:0%
and that is to augment
 
04:52:55.110 --> 04:52:55.120 align:start position:0%
police services right
 
04:52:56.868 --> 04:52:56.878 align:start position:0%
the unfortunate truth is that there's a
 
04:52:58.628 --> 04:52:58.638 align:start position:0%
lot of communities that have now used
 
04:53:01.030 --> 04:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
this program to supplant
 
04:53:03.910 --> 04:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
uh their their police services
 
04:53:06.310 --> 04:53:06.320 align:start position:0%
and that is um it's not fair to the
 
04:53:08.070 --> 04:53:08.080 align:start position:0%
citizens and it's not
 
04:53:10.788 --> 04:53:10.798 align:start position:0%
fair to the officers that are part-time
 
04:53:13.670 --> 04:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
and expected to do full-time work uh
 
04:53:16.310 --> 04:53:16.320 align:start position:0%
oftentimes by themselves and i think
 
04:53:19.110 --> 04:53:19.120 align:start position:0%
that's we're trying to balance
 
04:53:20.868 --> 04:53:20.878 align:start position:0%
those two things
 
04:53:20.878 --> 04:53:22.310 align:start position:0%
those two things
so

04:53:22.310 --> 04:53:22.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:53:24.390 --> 04:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
thank you does this request your budget
 
04:53:27.270 --> 04:53:27.280 align:start position:0%
request uh support trying to take on
 
04:53:28.868 --> 04:53:28.878 align:start position:0%
some initiatives with the part-time
 
04:53:31.350 --> 04:53:31.360 align:start position:0%
program uh yes it does it absolutely
 
04:53:33.590 --> 04:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
does uh it just creates more space for
 
04:53:35.670 --> 04:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
us to have those classes
 
04:53:37.270 --> 04:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
as it stands right now and the other
 
04:53:39.750 --> 04:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
resource that is
 
04:53:42.070 --> 04:53:42.080 align:start position:0%
is pretty thin is are the bodies the
 
04:53:44.150 --> 04:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
trainers right
 
04:53:45.830 --> 04:53:45.840 align:start position:0%
so um
 
04:53:47.990 --> 04:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
because of that
 
04:53:50.390 --> 04:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
lack of depth of resource
 
04:53:52.070 --> 04:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
i feel that we're probably only going to
 
04:53:54.628 --> 04:53:54.638 align:start position:0%
be able to hold one part-time academy a
 
04:53:54.638 --> 04:53:56.708 align:start position:0%
be able to hold one part-time academy a
year

04:53:56.708 --> 04:53:56.718 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:54:00.390 --> 04:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
as we move forward and and again i'll
 
04:54:03.110 --> 04:54:03.120 align:start position:0%
i'll try to address those resource needs
 
04:54:05.110 --> 04:54:05.120 align:start position:0%
as we move forward into the next fiscal
 
04:54:05.120 --> 04:54:06.868 align:start position:0%
as we move forward into the next fiscal
budget

04:54:06.868 --> 04:54:06.878 align:start position:0%
budget
 
04:54:09.910 --> 04:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:12.390 --> 04:54:12.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:54:13.830 --> 04:54:13.840 align:start position:0%
greatly appreciate it thank you very
 
04:54:13.840 --> 04:54:16.550 align:start position:0%

afternoon so you'll find in front of you
 
04:55:25.110 --> 04:55:25.120 align:start position:0%
um three of our top
 
04:55:27.110 --> 04:55:27.120 align:start position:0%
priority of our capital projects which
 
04:55:30.150 --> 04:55:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:32.230 --> 04:55:32.240 align:start position:0%
a summary of the the total funds
 
04:55:35.510 --> 04:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
requested uh broken down into uh general
 
04:55:37.990 --> 04:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
funds and federal funds
 
04:55:40.628 --> 04:55:40.638 align:start position:0%
and then we've included for each uh area
 
04:55:42.628 --> 04:55:42.638 align:start position:0%
a slide that we're prepared to discuss
 
04:55:45.110 --> 04:55:45.120 align:start position:0%
for those top three
 
04:55:47.990 --> 04:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
and our first one is the um
 
04:56:01.350 --> 04:56:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:03.830 --> 04:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
good afternoon david weeders information
 
04:56:06.230 --> 04:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
services director dhhs
 
04:56:09.110 --> 04:56:09.120 align:start position:0%
so the third on the third slide the
 
04:56:11.670 --> 04:56:11.680 align:start position:0%
statewide child welfare
 
04:56:13.670 --> 04:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
information system replacement we're in
 
04:56:13.680 --> 04:56:14.868 align:start position:0%
information system replacement we're in
our

04:56:14.868 --> 04:56:14.878 align:start position:0%
our
 
04:56:14.878 --> 04:56:15.750 align:start position:0%
our
third

04:56:15.750 --> 04:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
third
 
04:56:18.390 --> 04:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
third year of a six-year project
 
04:56:20.708 --> 04:56:20.718 align:start position:0%
actually moving into the last biennium
 
04:56:22.550 --> 04:56:22.560 align:start position:0%
so this budget
 
04:56:24.470 --> 04:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
request for the capital budget is for
 
04:56:26.788 --> 04:56:26.798 align:start position:0%
the last biennium of six years
 
04:56:28.550 --> 04:56:28.560 align:start position:0%
and it's for eleven million two hundred
 
04:56:30.390 --> 04:56:30.400 align:start position:0%
seventy thousand eight hundred dollars
 
04:56:32.070 --> 04:56:32.080 align:start position:0%
half of which are general funds and the
 
04:56:34.310 --> 04:56:34.320 align:start position:0%
other half are federal funds
 
04:56:35.990 --> 04:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
we work with the administration for
 
04:56:37.510 --> 04:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
children youth and families for that
 
04:56:39.190 --> 04:56:39.200 align:start position:0%
federal fund match
 
04:56:41.590 --> 04:56:41.600 align:start position:0%
this system has been
 
04:56:43.030 --> 04:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
working towards a sales force
 
04:56:45.590 --> 04:56:45.600 align:start position:0%
replacement of a 23 year old
 
04:56:48.230 --> 04:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
power builder application
 
04:56:51.030 --> 04:56:51.040 align:start position:0%
that system was required by acf or
 
04:56:52.788 --> 04:56:52.798 align:start position:0%
administration for children and families
 
04:56:54.788 --> 04:56:54.798 align:start position:0%
to be replaced with a comprehensive
 
04:56:58.070 --> 04:56:58.080 align:start position:0%
child welfare information system
 
04:57:00.070 --> 04:57:00.080 align:start position:0%
the current system named bridges or
 
04:57:00.080 --> 04:57:01.830 align:start position:0%
the current system named bridges or
saqquis

04:57:01.830 --> 04:57:01.840 align:start position:0%
saqquis
 
04:57:01.840 --> 04:57:03.190 align:start position:0%
saqquis
is

04:57:03.190 --> 04:57:03.200 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:57:05.110 --> 04:57:05.120 align:start position:0%
performing the necessary functions
 
04:57:07.430 --> 04:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
however on the old
 
04:57:10.948 --> 04:57:10.958 align:start position:0%
software it has limited itself for
 
04:57:13.350 --> 04:57:13.360 align:start position:0%
the effectiveness in a mobile community
 
04:57:15.270 --> 04:57:15.280 align:start position:0%
the effectiveness for our caseworkers to
 
04:57:18.230 --> 04:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
be able to go out and work with their
 
04:57:20.708 --> 04:57:20.718 align:start position:0%
their cases in the field as opposed to
 
04:57:22.470 --> 04:57:22.480 align:start position:0%
having to come back to the office to do
 
04:57:22.480 --> 04:57:23.350 align:start position:0%
having to come back to the office to do
work

04:57:23.350 --> 04:57:23.360 align:start position:0%
work
 
04:57:25.190 --> 04:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
this new system will allow for the
 
04:57:25.200 --> 04:57:26.310 align:start position:0%
this new system will allow for the
intake

04:57:26.310 --> 04:57:26.320 align:start position:0%
intake
 
04:57:29.030 --> 04:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
assessment and case management both
 
04:57:31.030 --> 04:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
in the office as well as in the field
 
04:57:31.040 --> 04:57:32.390 align:start position:0%
in the office as well as in the field
eliminating

04:57:32.390 --> 04:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
eliminating
 
04:57:34.788 --> 04:57:34.798 align:start position:0%
a lot of the productivity loss and
 
04:57:37.030 --> 04:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
allowing for the current workforce to
 
04:57:38.788 --> 04:57:38.798 align:start position:0%
deploy the services in a more effective
 
04:57:38.798 --> 04:57:41.910 align:start position:0%
deploy the services in a more effective
way

04:57:41.910 --> 04:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:43.430 --> 04:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
i'll stop there in case you have any
 
04:57:43.440 --> 04:57:47.270 align:start position:0%
i'll stop there in case you have any
questions

04:57:47.270 --> 04:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:47.280 --> 04:57:48.628 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:57:48.628 --> 04:57:48.638 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:57:51.190 --> 04:57:51.200 align:start position:0%
moving on to the fourth slide this is
 
04:57:53.110 --> 04:57:53.120 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire health facilities
 
04:57:55.830 --> 04:57:55.840 align:start position:0%
electronic health records system
 
04:57:57.830 --> 04:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
so currently we have new hampshire
 
04:57:59.110 --> 04:57:59.120 align:start position:0%
hospital that is running on an
 
04:58:01.590 --> 04:58:01.600 align:start position:0%
electronic health record system with the
 
04:58:03.830 --> 04:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
acquisition of hampstead hospital and
 
04:58:05.990 --> 04:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
the plan implementation of a forensic
 
04:58:08.230 --> 04:58:08.240 align:start position:0%
hospital we are looking to
 
04:58:10.788 --> 04:58:10.798 align:start position:0%
combine efforts and deploy a single
 
04:58:13.590 --> 04:58:13.600 align:start position:0%
electronic health record system across
 
04:58:15.990 --> 04:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
all three facilities and potentially
 
04:58:18.470 --> 04:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
additional facilities as needed
 
04:58:19.510 --> 04:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
this will
 
04:58:20.788 --> 04:58:20.798 align:start position:0%
allow for
 
04:58:20.798 --> 04:58:22.150 align:start position:0%
allow for
the

04:58:22.150 --> 04:58:22.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:58:24.390 --> 04:58:24.400 align:start position:0%
effective diagnosis treatment and
 
04:58:26.788 --> 04:58:26.798 align:start position:0%
services to interact with patients in a
 
04:58:29.270 --> 04:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
point of care or
 
04:58:32.230 --> 04:58:32.240 align:start position:0%
situation as well as
 
04:58:32.240 --> 04:58:33.590 align:start position:0%
situation as well as
eliminate

04:58:33.590 --> 04:58:33.600 align:start position:0%
eliminate
 
04:58:36.390 --> 04:58:36.400 align:start position:0%
duplicative efforts of the acquisition
 
04:58:38.070 --> 04:58:38.080 align:start position:0%
of hampstead hospital they currently do
 
04:58:39.750 --> 04:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
not have an electronic health record
 
04:58:39.760 --> 04:58:40.788 align:start position:0%
not have an electronic health record
system

04:58:40.788 --> 04:58:40.798 align:start position:0%
system
 
04:58:44.070 --> 04:58:44.080 align:start position:0%
and our goal is to expand and move that
 
04:58:46.310 --> 04:58:46.320 align:start position:0%
move that direction so we're not doing
 
04:58:49.030 --> 04:58:49.040 align:start position:0%
multiple ehrs
 
04:58:50.628 --> 04:58:50.638 align:start position:0%
which would cost about the same amount
 
04:58:52.708 --> 04:58:52.718 align:start position:0%
of money if not more if we had to do it
 
04:58:55.510 --> 04:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:58.070 --> 04:58:58.080 align:start position:0%
and this system is gonna is is looking
 
04:58:59.510 --> 04:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
at nineteen million five hundred and
 
04:59:02.150 --> 04:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollars of which
 
04:59:03.750 --> 04:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
we have thirteen million six hundred and
 
04:59:05.590 --> 04:59:05.600 align:start position:0%
eighty five thousand of general funds
 
04:59:07.350 --> 04:59:07.360 align:start position:0%
and five million eight hundred and sixty
 
04:59:10.070 --> 04:59:10.080 align:start position:0%
five thousand dollars of federal funds
 
04:59:12.310 --> 04:59:12.320 align:start position:0%
to implement this solution over the next
 
04:59:12.320 --> 04:59:19.030 align:start position:0%
to implement this solution over the next
biennium

04:59:19.030 --> 04:59:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:20.470 --> 04:59:20.480 align:start position:0%
and the
 
04:59:23.030 --> 04:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
fifth slide we have our elderly adult
 
04:59:25.830 --> 04:59:25.840 align:start position:0%
services system modernization
 
04:59:28.628 --> 04:59:28.638 align:start position:0%
this one we had submitted in the past
 
04:59:28.638 --> 04:59:29.910 align:start position:0%
this one we had submitted in the past
for

04:59:29.910 --> 04:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:59:31.910 --> 04:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
for biennium budgeting for capital
 
04:59:33.750 --> 04:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
projects and
 
04:59:35.750 --> 04:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
due to prioritization we moved forward
 
04:59:37.750 --> 04:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
on several other projects this biennium
 
04:59:39.270 --> 04:59:39.280 align:start position:0%
and we're looking to move this one
 
04:59:39.280 --> 04:59:40.550 align:start position:0%
and we're looking to move this one
forward

04:59:40.550 --> 04:59:40.560 align:start position:0%
forward
 
04:59:43.110 --> 04:59:43.120 align:start position:0%
in the next biennium this system manages
 
04:59:45.350 --> 04:59:45.360 align:start position:0%
our adult protective services on social
 
04:59:48.708 --> 04:59:48.718 align:start position:0%
worker caseloads and is again gold at
 
04:59:51.030 --> 04:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
leveraging the salesforce platform
 
04:59:53.590 --> 04:59:53.600 align:start position:0%
and you'll see a common theme is we're
 
04:59:55.830 --> 04:59:55.840 align:start position:0%
gold at using salesforce to reduce our
 
04:59:57.750 --> 04:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
licensing costs across multiple
 
04:59:59.750 --> 04:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
different platforms doing very similar
 
04:59:59.760 --> 05:00:01.190 align:start position:0%
different platforms doing very similar
functionality

05:00:01.190 --> 05:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
functionality
 
05:00:03.670 --> 05:00:03.680 align:start position:0%
however the reason why we have different
 
05:00:05.750 --> 05:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
capital submissions is each
 
05:00:07.830 --> 05:00:07.840 align:start position:0%
area has different requirements to be
 
05:00:09.270 --> 05:00:09.280 align:start position:0%
managed different workflows and
 
05:00:10.550 --> 05:00:10.560 align:start position:0%
different customizations that are
 
05:00:13.830 --> 05:00:13.840 align:start position:0%
required leveraging that same platform
 
05:00:16.310 --> 05:00:16.320 align:start position:0%
this will automate our tasks to allow
 
05:00:18.150 --> 05:00:18.160 align:start position:0%
for increased calls
 
05:00:20.390 --> 05:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
as well as increased investigations
 
05:00:22.390 --> 05:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
without requesting additional staffing
 
05:00:25.110 --> 05:00:25.120 align:start position:0%
to do those additional services
 
05:00:27.190 --> 05:00:27.200 align:start position:0%
the total amount is six million seven
 
05:00:28.550 --> 05:00:28.560 align:start position:0%
hundred ninety five thousand four
 
05:00:30.628 --> 05:00:30.638 align:start position:0%
hundred and twenty seven dollars
 
05:00:32.628 --> 05:00:32.638 align:start position:0%
of which four million seventy seven
 
05:00:35.110 --> 05:00:35.120 align:start position:0%
thousand fifty 256 is general funds and
 
05:00:37.110 --> 05:00:37.120 align:start position:0%
then the remaining two million seven
 
05:00:38.230 --> 05:00:38.240 align:start position:0%
hundred and eighteen thousand one
 
05:00:40.550 --> 05:00:40.560 align:start position:0%
hundred seventy one is federal funds
 
05:00:42.628 --> 05:00:42.638 align:start position:0%
and that was associated with working
 
05:00:44.150 --> 05:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
through multiple sales force
 
05:00:46.550 --> 05:00:46.560 align:start position:0%
implementations as well as
 
05:00:48.470 --> 05:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
requests for information to get an idea
 
05:00:50.150 --> 05:00:50.160 align:start position:0%
of the cost for both salesforce
 
05:00:51.990 --> 05:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
licensing and professional services to
 
05:00:52.000 --> 05:00:54.070 align:start position:0%
licensing and professional services to
implement

05:00:54.070 --> 05:00:54.080 align:start position:0%
implement
 
05:00:55.350 --> 05:00:55.360 align:start position:0%
i'm going to go ahead and turn it back
 
05:00:57.430 --> 05:00:57.440 align:start position:0%
over to nathan to go over our summary
 
05:00:57.440 --> 05:00:59.910 align:start position:0%
over to nathan to go over our summary
side

05:00:59.910 --> 05:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:01.430 --> 05:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
thank you dude
 
05:01:03.590 --> 05:01:03.600 align:start position:0%
um on the last slide is the summary
 
05:01:05.990 --> 05:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
slide again the the total fund request
 
05:01:08.628 --> 05:01:08.638 align:start position:0%
here is approximately 37.6 million
 
05:01:12.150 --> 05:01:12.160 align:start position:0%
dollars um comprising of 23.4 general
 
05:01:12.160 --> 05:01:13.110 align:start position:0%
dollars um comprising of 23.4 general
funds

05:01:13.110 --> 05:01:13.120 align:start position:0%
funds
 
05:01:18.150 --> 05:01:18.160 align:start position:0%
and 14.2 million in federal funds from a
 
05:01:20.230 --> 05:01:20.240 align:start position:0%
percentage split that's roughly 62
 
05:01:23.590 --> 05:01:23.600 align:start position:0%
percent general funds and 38 federal
 
05:01:25.030 --> 05:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
05:01:29.350 --> 05:01:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:31.750 --> 05:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
good afternoon again a
 
05:01:33.830 --> 05:01:33.840 align:start position:0%
question on the
 
05:01:35.110 --> 05:01:35.120 align:start position:0%
electronic health records i don't know
 
05:01:36.230 --> 05:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
if you could take a minute and just
 
05:01:38.708 --> 05:01:38.718 align:start position:0%
explain the system you currently have
 
05:01:40.628 --> 05:01:40.638 align:start position:0%
that you're currently using
 
05:01:40.638 --> 05:01:42.070 align:start position:0%
that you're currently using
and

05:01:42.070 --> 05:01:42.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:01:43.990 --> 05:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
how and why that needs to be replaced
 
05:01:57.430 --> 05:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:59.190 --> 05:01:59.200 align:start position:0%
good morning uh joe christie cfo for new
 
05:02:00.550 --> 05:02:00.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital
 
05:02:02.470 --> 05:02:02.480 align:start position:0%
hi i'm ellen lapoint i'm the ceo at new
 
05:02:04.070 --> 05:02:04.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital
 
05:02:07.030 --> 05:02:07.040 align:start position:0%
so we currently have netsmart um avatar
 
05:02:09.030 --> 05:02:09.040 align:start position:0%
as our ehr
 
05:02:12.868 --> 05:02:12.878 align:start position:0%
it is a product that we struggle with
 
05:02:12.878 --> 05:02:14.628 align:start position:0%
it is a product that we struggle with
it

05:02:14.628 --> 05:02:14.638 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:02:16.868 --> 05:02:16.878 align:start position:0%
isn't something that is very user
 
05:02:16.878 --> 05:02:18.070 align:start position:0%
isn't something that is very user
friendly

05:02:18.070 --> 05:02:18.080 align:start position:0%
friendly
 
05:02:21.270 --> 05:02:21.280 align:start position:0%
and it takes a lot of
 
05:02:24.550 --> 05:02:24.560 align:start position:0%
rework and support for us to be able to
 
05:02:26.310 --> 05:02:26.320 align:start position:0%
do what we need to do on a daily basis
 
05:02:28.788 --> 05:02:28.798 align:start position:0%
in regards to patient care we several
 
05:02:28.798 --> 05:02:29.910 align:start position:0%
in regards to patient care we several
times

05:02:29.910 --> 05:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
times
 
05:02:31.990 --> 05:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
in recent history have had to go back to
 
05:02:34.230 --> 05:02:34.240 align:start position:0%
netsmart and avatar and ask for changes
 
05:02:36.070 --> 05:02:36.080 align:start position:0%
with the product and
 
05:02:37.750 --> 05:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
different support that we need to be
 
05:02:39.990 --> 05:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
able to make it user friendly whether it
 
05:02:42.310 --> 05:02:42.320 align:start position:0%
be in different reports that we need to
 
05:02:43.910 --> 05:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
be able to operate the hospital or
 
05:02:46.788 --> 05:02:46.798 align:start position:0%
whether it be in daily function
 
05:02:48.550 --> 05:02:48.560 align:start position:0%
you know on a routine basis for patient
 
05:02:50.868 --> 05:02:50.878 align:start position:0%
care so it's somewhat of an antiquated
 
05:02:50.878 --> 05:02:51.830 align:start position:0%
care so it's somewhat of an antiquated
system

05:02:51.830 --> 05:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
system
 
05:02:54.070 --> 05:02:54.080 align:start position:0%
and we do struggle with its operation
 
05:02:56.070 --> 05:02:56.080 align:start position:0%
pretty routinely when was that system
 
05:02:57.990 --> 05:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
purchased the one you currently are
 
05:02:58.000 --> 05:03:03.750 align:start position:0%
purchased the one you currently are
using

05:03:03.750 --> 05:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:13.350 --> 05:03:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:14.948 --> 05:03:14.958 align:start position:0%
the systems like that have a have a
 
05:03:16.868 --> 05:03:16.878 align:start position:0%
useful life and is that the case here
 
05:03:18.550 --> 05:03:18.560 align:start position:0%
where the useful life has been
 
05:03:20.948 --> 05:03:20.958 align:start position:0%
expired or expiring or is it more along
 
05:03:22.788 --> 05:03:22.798 align:start position:0%
the lines of we have this and which may
 
05:03:25.110 --> 05:03:25.120 align:start position:0%
be a mistake to have bought it and we're
 
05:03:27.270 --> 05:03:27.280 align:start position:0%
looking for something to
 
05:03:29.190 --> 05:03:29.200 align:start position:0%
you know get us to where we need to be i
 
05:03:30.550 --> 05:03:30.560 align:start position:0%
would certainly say there's a useful
 
05:03:33.590 --> 05:03:33.600 align:start position:0%
life component to this um the the system
 
05:03:36.708 --> 05:03:36.718 align:start position:0%
runs on outdated information
 
05:03:38.310 --> 05:03:38.320 align:start position:0%
software system technology i believe
 
05:03:40.550 --> 05:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
it's java based
 
05:03:41.830 --> 05:03:41.840 align:start position:0%
which is
 
05:03:44.230 --> 05:03:44.240 align:start position:0%
quite outdated at this point the system
 
05:03:47.110 --> 05:03:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:48.868 --> 05:03:48.878 align:start position:0%
a ton of functionality out of the gate
 
05:03:51.670 --> 05:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
either though so it was it was an okay
 
05:03:53.830 --> 05:03:53.840 align:start position:0%
system when we bought it um and it's it
 
05:03:56.550 --> 05:03:56.560 align:start position:0%
certainly aged uh itself out uh pretty
 
05:03:59.750 --> 05:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:01.670 --> 05:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
and for clarity's sake we just heard
 
05:04:02.948 --> 05:04:02.958 align:start position:0%
that it was actually purchased about
 
05:04:09.750 --> 05:04:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:11.350 --> 05:04:11.360 align:start position:0%
as a commissioner just to comment on
 
05:04:13.990 --> 05:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
that in a question for the group um
 
05:04:14.000 --> 05:04:14.868 align:start position:0%
that in a question for the group um
so

05:04:14.868 --> 05:04:14.878 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:04:18.070 --> 05:04:18.080 align:start position:0%
you know when i arrived in in 2015 the
 
05:04:21.270 --> 05:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
system was partially implemented and
 
05:04:23.510 --> 05:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
what i observed was that the
 
05:04:25.350 --> 05:04:25.360 align:start position:0%
the folks in in new hampshire hospital
 
05:04:27.030 --> 05:04:27.040 align:start position:0%
at the time had
 
05:04:27.040 --> 05:04:27.830 align:start position:0%
at the time had
had

05:04:27.830 --> 05:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
had
 
05:04:29.750 --> 05:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know that they'd fully vetted
 
05:04:31.510 --> 05:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
what was required to run the business
 
05:04:33.030 --> 05:04:33.040 align:start position:0%
and and so
 
05:04:34.788 --> 05:04:34.798 align:start position:0%
even out of the gate we were having
 
05:04:37.350 --> 05:04:37.360 align:start position:0%
challenges with the system and we
 
05:04:39.190 --> 05:04:39.200 align:start position:0%
mitigated some of them on on the
 
05:04:41.030 --> 05:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
operational side but it's still the same
 
05:04:42.550 --> 05:04:42.560 align:start position:0%
software so
 
05:04:43.910 --> 05:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
so um
 
05:04:46.070 --> 05:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
so i i'm not surprised to see this on
 
05:04:47.990 --> 05:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
there but um
 
05:04:49.990 --> 05:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering is is glencliff part of
 
05:05:00.550 --> 05:05:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:02.788 --> 05:05:02.798 align:start position:0%
so it certainly is gold at being able to
 
05:05:04.310 --> 05:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
be leveraged for glencliff however
 
05:05:05.910 --> 05:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
glencliff has a
 
05:05:07.990 --> 05:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
slightly different use case on how they
 
05:05:10.390 --> 05:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
use an electronic health record system
 
05:05:13.190 --> 05:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
so our goal is to really implement for
 
05:05:14.868 --> 05:05:14.878 align:start position:0%
hampstead new hampshire hospital in the
 
05:05:14.878 --> 05:05:16.070 align:start position:0%
hampstead new hampshire hospital in the
forensics

05:05:16.070 --> 05:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
forensics
 
05:05:18.070 --> 05:05:18.080 align:start position:0%
forensic hospital with the
 
05:05:20.310 --> 05:05:20.320 align:start position:0%
the uh the opportunity to expand into
 
05:05:23.190 --> 05:05:23.200 align:start position:0%
glenclef and have the licensing there or
 
05:05:25.670 --> 05:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
ability to purchase the licensing to do
 
05:05:28.628 --> 05:05:28.638 align:start position:0%
that but our first three workflows
 
05:05:30.390 --> 05:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
workloads were going to be those three
 
05:05:30.400 --> 05:05:36.708 align:start position:0%
workloads were going to be those three
hospitals

05:05:36.708 --> 05:05:36.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:38.868 --> 05:05:38.878 align:start position:0%
um so you say that the it
 
05:05:40.830 --> 05:05:40.840 align:start position:0%
when you deploy the system it will
 
05:05:43.670 --> 05:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
accommodate two thousand users three
 
05:05:46.550 --> 05:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
hundred external agencies and up to four
 
05:05:49.270 --> 05:05:49.280 align:start position:0%
four health care facilities
 
05:05:49.280 --> 05:05:50.310 align:start position:0%
four health care facilities
um

05:05:50.310 --> 05:05:50.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:05:51.990 --> 05:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming that
 
05:05:52.000 --> 05:05:53.750 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming that
exceeds

05:05:53.750 --> 05:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
exceeds
 
05:05:56.390 --> 05:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
what your existing system can do right
 
05:05:56.400 --> 05:05:58.948 align:start position:0%
what your existing system can do right
now

05:05:58.948 --> 05:05:58.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:01.110 --> 05:06:01.120 align:start position:0%
that is correct so the existing system
 
05:06:03.030 --> 05:06:03.040 align:start position:0%
can only support new hampshire hospital
 
05:06:05.270 --> 05:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
in order to extend the netsmart our
 
05:06:07.510 --> 05:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
avatar system to the other
 
05:06:09.590 --> 05:06:09.600 align:start position:0%
solutions it would actually require a
 
05:06:11.750 --> 05:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
major overhaul and a capital budget to
 
05:06:13.750 --> 05:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
do that as well
 
05:06:16.550 --> 05:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
the the other just as an added thing the
 
05:06:18.868 --> 05:06:18.878 align:start position:0%
net netsmart is a product that is really
 
05:06:20.868 --> 05:06:20.878 align:start position:0%
gold towards small organizations and
 
05:06:22.390 --> 05:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
it's not in the
 
05:06:24.230 --> 05:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't say it was in the enterprise
 
05:06:26.470 --> 05:06:26.480 align:start position:0%
scale like cerner or epic those other
 
05:06:28.550 --> 05:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
type of systems they're really designed
 
05:06:31.510 --> 05:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
to be able to support multiple hospitals
 
05:06:33.990 --> 05:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
whereas netsmart does a decent job of
 
05:06:36.470 --> 05:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
one hospital it would have difficulty
 
05:06:40.708 --> 05:06:40.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:45.590 --> 05:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:48.390 --> 05:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:50.390 --> 05:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
all of these are matched with federal
 
05:06:53.590 --> 05:06:53.600 align:start position:0%
funds to a certain extent
 
05:06:56.470 --> 05:06:56.480 align:start position:0%
cash works just as well as a bonded cash
 
05:06:56.480 --> 05:06:58.390 align:start position:0%
cash works just as well as a bonded cash
correct

05:06:58.390 --> 05:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
correct
 
05:06:59.590 --> 05:06:59.600 align:start position:0%
for those
 
05:07:01.990 --> 05:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
matching what i'm saying is you probably
 
05:07:02.948 --> 05:07:02.958 align:start position:0%
ought to
 
05:07:05.190 --> 05:07:05.200 align:start position:0%
consider at least asking for some of it
 
05:07:07.830 --> 05:07:07.840 align:start position:0%
in your operating budget or from the
 
05:07:07.840 --> 05:07:09.030 align:start position:0%
in your operating budget or from the
surplus

05:07:09.030 --> 05:07:09.040 align:start position:0%
surplus
 
05:07:11.270 --> 05:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
rather than taking about 20
 
05:07:14.628 --> 05:07:14.638 align:start position:0%
percent of my math is correct of a
 
05:07:17.430 --> 05:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
potential capital budget for software
 
05:07:24.550 --> 05:07:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:25.750 --> 05:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for the information that's
 
05:07:27.990 --> 05:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
certainly something we can consider
 
05:07:29.590 --> 05:07:29.600 align:start position:0%
in most cases
 
05:07:31.750 --> 05:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
we have we submit on our operating
 
05:07:34.310 --> 05:07:34.320 align:start position:0%
budget or the maintenance and operations
 
05:07:37.110 --> 05:07:37.120 align:start position:0%
going forward but i certainly will we
 
05:07:38.788 --> 05:07:38.798 align:start position:0%
can discuss that with our finance group
 
05:07:46.868 --> 05:07:46.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:48.788 --> 05:07:48.798 align:start position:0%
hey there good afternoon i believe in
 
05:07:50.948 --> 05:07:50.958 align:start position:0%
the last capital budget um there was
 
05:07:52.788 --> 05:07:52.798 align:start position:0%
significant funding put aside for
 
05:07:55.110 --> 05:07:55.120 align:start position:0%
upgrading your medicaid system your
 
05:07:57.510 --> 05:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
medicaid mmis system so i was just
 
05:07:59.430 --> 05:07:59.440 align:start position:0%
wondering if that project is near
 
05:08:01.270 --> 05:08:01.280 align:start position:0%
completion and how are your resources to
 
05:08:04.628 --> 05:08:04.638 align:start position:0%
take on two additional i.t projects
 
05:08:06.470 --> 05:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
that's a very good question so we have
 
05:08:08.948 --> 05:08:08.958 align:start position:0%
multiple different teams set up both
 
05:08:12.550 --> 05:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
with doit as well as dhhs to achieve
 
05:08:14.470 --> 05:08:14.480 align:start position:0%
different projects like this so that the
 
05:08:16.230 --> 05:08:16.240 align:start position:0%
medicaid management information system
 
05:08:18.310 --> 05:08:18.320 align:start position:0%
that was had several different projects
 
05:08:21.110 --> 05:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
in the last biennium approved is i would
 
05:08:23.510 --> 05:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
say on its way but there it was a
 
05:08:25.670 --> 05:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
five-year project um program somewhere
 
05:08:28.470 --> 05:08:28.480 align:start position:0%
in year two of that year five and those
 
05:08:30.708 --> 05:08:30.718 align:start position:0%
project teams would not be impacted by
 
05:08:32.788 --> 05:08:32.798 align:start position:0%
the the projects that you see here today
 
05:08:34.708 --> 05:08:34.718 align:start position:0%
because we have a different team for
 
05:08:37.030 --> 05:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
our children youth and families and a
 
05:08:38.708 --> 05:08:38.718 align:start position:0%
totally separate team for new hampshire
 
05:08:40.788 --> 05:08:40.798 align:start position:0%
hospital and then a third one for the
 
05:08:46.788 --> 05:08:46.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:48.230 --> 05:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
i do have something i wanted to say
 
05:08:50.150 --> 05:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
about representative graham's point
 
05:08:51.750 --> 05:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
which i
 
05:08:54.230 --> 05:08:54.240 align:start position:0%
you know anybody who does buildings um
 
05:08:56.390 --> 05:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
shares the concern about the extent to
 
05:08:58.230 --> 05:08:58.240 align:start position:0%
which they're gradually eaten up by i.t
 
05:08:58.240 --> 05:09:00.470 align:start position:0%
which they're gradually eaten up by i.t
projects

05:09:00.470 --> 05:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
projects
 
05:09:00.480 --> 05:09:01.670 align:start position:0%
projects
but

05:09:01.670 --> 05:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:09:03.430 --> 05:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
i think it's a statewide thing rather
 
05:09:05.270 --> 05:09:05.280 align:start position:0%
than a departmental thing where we have
 
05:09:07.110 --> 05:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
to we're going to figure out as a state
 
05:09:10.150 --> 05:09:10.160 align:start position:0%
how we do these things because
 
05:09:11.270 --> 05:09:11.280 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:09:13.110 --> 05:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
it is more and more and more expensive
 
05:09:15.510 --> 05:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
all the time and and that's not that's
 
05:09:18.150 --> 05:09:18.160 align:start position:0%
also true of buildings and at some point
 
05:09:19.430 --> 05:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
we're gonna have to balance those things
 
05:09:21.750 --> 05:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
and how exactly you balance it at the
 
05:09:23.350 --> 05:09:23.360 align:start position:0%
end of the day if you're an agency
 
05:09:25.110 --> 05:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
trying to run your operation
 
05:09:27.030 --> 05:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
you look at it and you say well i need a
 
05:09:28.948 --> 05:09:28.958 align:start position:0%
roof actually to some extent you might
 
05:09:30.230 --> 05:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
not say that because you think the roof
 
05:09:31.590 --> 05:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
is taken for granted and somebody else
 
05:09:32.948 --> 05:09:32.958 align:start position:0%
will take care of it
 
05:09:34.310 --> 05:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
and you're thinking
 
05:09:35.910 --> 05:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
nobody will give me 20 million in my
 
05:09:38.230 --> 05:09:38.240 align:start position:0%
operating budget to save my life so i'm
 
05:09:40.150 --> 05:09:40.160 align:start position:0%
going to support in the capital budget
 
05:09:41.830 --> 05:09:41.840 align:start position:0%
and because isn't that where we do big
 
05:09:44.150 --> 05:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
it projects i guess it is and then the
 
05:09:46.230 --> 05:09:46.240 align:start position:0%
counterpoint is should we be bonding a
 
05:09:49.350 --> 05:09:49.360 align:start position:0%
six or eight year project over 20 years
 
05:09:52.070 --> 05:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
well no but what's the alternative so i
 
05:09:54.550 --> 05:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
think i think at some point the capital
 
05:09:56.230 --> 05:09:56.240 align:start position:0%
budget people and the operating budget
 
05:09:56.240 --> 05:09:57.190 align:start position:0%
budget people and the operating budget
people

05:09:57.190 --> 05:09:57.200 align:start position:0%
people
 
05:09:58.708 --> 05:09:58.718 align:start position:0%
and the legislative and the executive
 
05:10:00.628 --> 05:10:00.638 align:start position:0%
probably ought to get together and
 
05:10:00.638 --> 05:10:01.430 align:start position:0%
probably ought to get together and
um

05:10:01.430 --> 05:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:10:06.550 --> 05:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:09.350 --> 05:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
please um so so um
 
05:10:12.150 --> 05:10:12.160 align:start position:0%
you know if this let's take the uh
 
05:10:13.910 --> 05:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
uh electronic health record as an
 
05:10:16.310 --> 05:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
example but um you know if we were to
 
05:10:18.628 --> 05:10:18.638 align:start position:0%
fund that now we would have actually run
 
05:10:20.948 --> 05:10:20.958 align:start position:0%
the system for 10 years which i would
 
05:10:24.470 --> 05:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
consider a reasonable amount of time and
 
05:10:26.150 --> 05:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
and perhaps more than that a lot of a
 
05:10:27.910 --> 05:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
lot of our systems have successfully run
 
05:10:29.590 --> 05:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
for considerably more than 10 years and
 
05:10:31.110 --> 05:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
when they get to 30 years then you're
 
05:10:33.030 --> 05:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
saying ah that's too long so somewhere
 
05:10:35.270 --> 05:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
in between there i've been recommending
 
05:10:37.510 --> 05:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
that we do initial contracts for a
 
05:10:39.430 --> 05:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
decade on these big systems so that
 
05:10:40.550 --> 05:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
we're not
 
05:10:43.030 --> 05:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
you know because we're committing to
 
05:10:45.830 --> 05:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
um you know we're committing to a vendor
 
05:10:47.270 --> 05:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
tend to get lower pricing that way
 
05:10:48.948 --> 05:10:48.958 align:start position:0%
versus three years and then keep going
 
05:10:50.390 --> 05:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
back to the well with the executive
 
05:10:52.150 --> 05:10:52.160 align:start position:0%
council after that so
 
05:10:53.830 --> 05:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
so i would say that you know if you get
 
05:10:55.510 --> 05:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
a decade out of it that's pretty good
 
05:10:58.070 --> 05:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
now the funding methodology you know i i
 
05:11:00.628 --> 05:11:00.638 align:start position:0%
wish the treasury were here to talk us
 
05:11:02.628 --> 05:11:02.638 align:start position:0%
to us about bonding because i'm not sure
 
05:11:04.948 --> 05:11:04.958 align:start position:0%
everything's bonded at 20 years i think
 
05:11:07.990 --> 05:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
there were some shorter durations
 
05:11:09.190 --> 05:11:09.200 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
05:11:11.350 --> 05:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
and so that there may actually be
 
05:11:13.430 --> 05:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
um there may be a little more it may be
 
05:11:14.788 --> 05:11:14.798 align:start position:0%
a little smarter than we're thinking
 
05:11:16.230 --> 05:11:16.240 align:start position:0%
right now but
 
05:11:18.628 --> 05:11:18.638 align:start position:0%
they they do go out
 
05:11:22.070 --> 05:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
um annually for 20-year blinds for every
 
05:11:22.080 --> 05:11:23.110 align:start position:0%
um annually for 20-year blinds for every
project

05:11:23.110 --> 05:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
project
 
05:11:23.120 --> 05:11:24.230 align:start position:0%
project
um

05:11:24.230 --> 05:11:24.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:11:26.150 --> 05:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
at one point they were trying i don't
 
05:11:28.390 --> 05:11:28.400 align:start position:0%
know if they still do to say the
 
05:11:30.868 --> 05:11:30.878 align:start position:0%
legislature was saying well it's only
 
05:11:32.868 --> 05:11:32.878 align:start position:0%
for five years but they still went out
 
05:11:35.510 --> 05:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
on the same bond issue for 20 years and
 
05:11:37.430 --> 05:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
then it was an internal
 
05:11:37.440 --> 05:11:38.788 align:start position:0%
then it was an internal
um

05:11:38.788 --> 05:11:38.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:11:41.510 --> 05:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
check mark of well this one may be paid
 
05:11:43.750 --> 05:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
off in five years but
 
05:11:46.788 --> 05:11:46.798 align:start position:0%
we're still going out with one big
 
05:11:48.230 --> 05:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
bonding issue
 
05:11:48.240 --> 05:11:49.510 align:start position:0%
bonding issue
for

05:11:49.510 --> 05:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:11:51.910 --> 05:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
the money once a year
 
05:11:53.590 --> 05:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
i think it's hard to do debt management
 
05:11:55.510 --> 05:11:55.520 align:start position:0%
any other way right you you you know
 
05:11:56.868 --> 05:11:56.878 align:start position:0%
they're doing they go out with a bond
 
05:11:58.788 --> 05:11:58.798 align:start position:0%
offering and you know we're a little
 
05:12:01.350 --> 05:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
tiny two-bit state you know remember
 
05:12:03.110 --> 05:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
that like you know in a marketplace term
 
05:12:04.470 --> 05:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
we're one-half of one percent of the
 
05:12:06.310 --> 05:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
population in the country
 
05:12:08.230 --> 05:12:08.240 align:start position:0%
and and to try to do a little bit of
 
05:12:09.830 --> 05:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
this and a little bit of that
 
05:12:11.430 --> 05:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
at some point the bond market looks at
 
05:12:13.110 --> 05:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
it and goes oh for god's sakes just put
 
05:12:14.948 --> 05:12:14.958 align:start position:0%
a bond on a market we'll bid on
 
05:12:16.628 --> 05:12:16.638 align:start position:0%
something i'm not bidding on three
 
05:12:17.750 --> 05:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
little things
 
05:12:20.070 --> 05:12:20.080 align:start position:0%
and so that's an issue but but it's you
 
05:12:21.990 --> 05:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
know with i.t that whole capex versus
 
05:12:23.830 --> 05:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
opex thing is a
 
05:12:26.150 --> 05:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
riddle we haven't solved yeah and i was
 
05:12:28.230 --> 05:12:28.240 align:start position:0%
thinking about our comments earlier
 
05:12:30.230 --> 05:12:30.240 align:start position:0%
because i was talking to you about the
 
05:12:31.910 --> 05:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
big bump in the beginning with the
 
05:12:33.590 --> 05:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
traditional acquisition value and you
 
05:12:36.150 --> 05:12:36.160 align:start position:0%
take some of that out with the software
 
05:12:37.270 --> 05:12:37.280 align:start position:0%
as a service but you still have
 
05:12:39.030 --> 05:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
implementation costs
 
05:12:41.510 --> 05:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
that that do exist but we have it you
 
05:12:43.430 --> 05:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
know charlie was talking about deferred
 
05:12:45.830 --> 05:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
maintenance we have a term in i.t called
 
05:12:47.590 --> 05:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
technical debt and it's really the same
 
05:12:49.030 --> 05:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
thing we're carrying a ton of that in
 
05:12:51.110 --> 05:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
the state a lot of old systems that may
 
05:12:53.030 --> 05:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
or may not be compliant so it's not
 
05:12:53.990 --> 05:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
really a
 
05:12:55.830 --> 05:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
either or it's as i think as charlie
 
05:12:58.230 --> 05:12:58.240 align:start position:0%
correctly said we have to decide
 
05:12:59.910 --> 05:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
where we're going to draw the line
 
05:13:02.470 --> 05:13:02.480 align:start position:0%
during each biennium based on the
 
05:13:04.708 --> 05:13:04.718 align:start position:0%
overall set of priorities for the state
 
05:13:06.230 --> 05:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
and i know that like in the last two
 
05:13:07.830 --> 05:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
biennium it's been a pretty big
 
05:13:09.350 --> 05:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
difference in dollars i think it was
 
05:13:11.270 --> 05:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
double this last biennium how much we
 
05:13:13.590 --> 05:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
funded on the i.t side than we had prior
 
05:13:14.948 --> 05:13:14.958 align:start position:0%
i actually have the history of the whole
 
05:13:16.390 --> 05:13:16.400 align:start position:0%
thing i can send it to the committee if
 
05:13:18.310 --> 05:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
you want for many years going back
 
05:13:20.470 --> 05:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
because we were looking at that but i
 
05:13:21.590 --> 05:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
you know i think it's an overall
 
05:13:24.948 --> 05:13:24.958 align:start position:0%
prioritization thing yeah the way we the
 
05:13:26.708 --> 05:13:26.718 align:start position:0%
the way you could do dead is is one of
 
05:13:27.990 --> 05:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
two ways you could you could you could
 
05:13:30.628 --> 05:13:30.638 align:start position:0%
issue it in you know have an an i.t
 
05:13:30.638 --> 05:13:31.590 align:start position:0%
issue it in you know have an an i.t
issue

05:13:31.590 --> 05:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
issue
 
05:13:33.510 --> 05:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
where it's a shorter term issue that's
 
05:13:36.070 --> 05:13:36.080 align:start position:0%
designed specifically to raise money for
 
05:13:38.470 --> 05:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
it projects and then a longer term
 
05:13:39.910 --> 05:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
one that would go out 20 years for your
 
05:13:41.750 --> 05:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
buildings and things like that
 
05:13:43.350 --> 05:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
but you know the
 
05:13:45.110 --> 05:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
for efficiency purposes you group them
 
05:13:47.350 --> 05:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
together and so long as you don't have
 
05:13:49.270 --> 05:13:49.280 align:start position:0%
just i.t projects with eight year useful
 
05:13:51.350 --> 05:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
life going out 20 years i mean the
 
05:13:53.670 --> 05:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
market would view that very dimly
 
05:13:55.590 --> 05:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
however because we
 
05:13:55.600 --> 05:13:56.948 align:start position:0%
however because we
integrate

05:13:56.948 --> 05:13:56.958 align:start position:0%
integrate
 
05:13:59.590 --> 05:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
projects like buildings into that and
 
05:14:01.430 --> 05:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
typically the way new hampshire does it
 
05:14:03.270 --> 05:14:03.280 align:start position:0%
is they're front loaded debt
 
05:14:05.990 --> 05:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
and so it's it's the principle is paid
 
05:14:08.708 --> 05:14:08.718 align:start position:0%
off fairly rapidly over 20 years so as
 
05:14:10.788 --> 05:14:10.798 align:start position:0%
long as the useful lives of the projects
 
05:14:12.070 --> 05:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
match up with the useful lives of the
 
05:14:17.750 --> 05:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:19.110 --> 05:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
05:14:21.910 --> 05:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
may i just i just some of the challenges
 
05:14:24.310 --> 05:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
um i just our capital budget is
 
05:14:26.150 --> 05:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
obviously our needs are more than three
 
05:14:28.628 --> 05:14:28.638 align:start position:0%
requests um it is challenging that
 
05:14:30.230 --> 05:14:30.240 align:start position:0%
they're all i.t that doesn't mean that
 
05:14:32.708 --> 05:14:32.718 align:start position:0%
we don't as charlie knows have any uh
 
05:14:34.470 --> 05:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
building uh challenges as well so it's
 
05:14:36.150 --> 05:14:36.160 align:start position:0%
challenging for us as an agency to sort
 
05:14:37.830 --> 05:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
of make that priority and knowing that
 
05:14:40.070 --> 05:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
we need these systems to do our business
 
05:14:41.910 --> 05:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
and serve our clients but we also need
 
05:14:43.830 --> 05:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
to take care of all of the other
 
05:14:45.590 --> 05:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
maintenance which will and eventually
 
05:14:47.430 --> 05:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
end up in our operating budget so either
 
05:14:50.628 --> 05:14:50.638 align:start position:0%
way it's it's a challenging situation so
 
05:14:53.270 --> 05:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
just want to throw that in there
 
05:14:53.280 --> 05:14:54.868 align:start position:0%
just want to throw that in there
okay

05:14:54.868 --> 05:14:54.878 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:14:56.550 --> 05:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
okay i'd like to thank everyone for
 
05:15:00.070 --> 05:15:00.080 align:start position:0%
participating today and the
 
05:15:02.550 --> 05:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
yes i believe so and the uh the hearing
 
05:15:05.270 --> 05:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
will uh stand in recess until 9 a.m
 
05:15:29.910 --> 05:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:29.920 --> 05:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
you
